Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle decay in a bubble chamber. Hmm, let me think. I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but I'll try to work through it.

The problem says that X⁰ decays into Y⁺ and Z⁻, and the proper lifetime is τ₀ = 8e-16 seconds. We need to find the minimum resolution required to observe at least 30% of these decays. The energy in the bubble chamber is 27 GeV, and the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV. The options are all in meters, so I'm guessing this is about the distance the particles travel before decaying, and the resolution needed to detect that.

Wait, right. In particle physics, when a particle decays, the distance it travels before decaying depends on its velocity and lifetime. But since it's moving in the lab frame, we have to consider the time dilation effect. The proper lifetime is the lifetime measured in the particle's rest frame. So the actual lifetime observed in the lab is longer due to gamma (γ) factor.

So the formula for the lifetime in the lab frame is τ = γ τ₀. To find γ, I need to find the velocity of the particle. Because the particle is moving at a certain energy, which is given as 27 GeV. Wait, the mass is 3.41 GeV, so I can find the gamma using the energy relation.

The energy E of a relativistic particle is given by E = γ m c². So γ is E divided by (m c²). But since the units are in GeV and mass is in GeV/c², I think the c² will cancel out. So γ = E / m. But wait, E is given as 27 GeV, and m is 3.41 GeV/c². So γ = 27 GeV / (3.41 GeV/c² * c²) ? Wait, maybe I should think in terms of units.

Wait, let's clarify the units. The mass m is 3.41 GeV/c². So the energy E is 27 GeV. So γ = E / (m c²) = (27 GeV) / (3.41 GeV/c² * c²) ) → the GeV cancels, c² cancels, so γ = 27 / 3.41 ≈ 7.918. Let me calculate that more accurately. 27 divided by 3.41 is approximately 7.917. So gamma is around 7.917.

Now, the lifetime in the lab frame is τ = γ τ₀. So τ = 7.917 * 8e-16 s. Let me calculate that. 8 *7.917 is approx 63.336, so 63.336e-16 s, which is 6.3336e-15 seconds.

But wait, the question is about the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. I think resolution refers to the detection
