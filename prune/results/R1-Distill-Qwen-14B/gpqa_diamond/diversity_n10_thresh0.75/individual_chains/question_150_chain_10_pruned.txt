Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's start by looking at the problem.

The question is about a compound with the molecular formula C8H9NO. The NMR data is provided, and then the compound undergoes a series of reactions. I need to determine the final product from the given options.

First, I'll try to analyze the NMR data to figure out the structure of the starting compound.

The 1H NMR data is as follows:
- 9.72 ppm (t, 1H)
- 6.98 ppm (d, 2H)
- 6.51 ppm (d, 2H)
- 6.27 ppm (bs, 2H)
- 3.66 ppm (d, 2H)

Hmm. Let's break this down.

The peak at 9.72 ppm is a triplet integrating to 1H. That's a high chemical shift, likely an aldehyde proton. So maybe there's an aldehyde group (-CHO) in the molecule.

Looking at the aromatic region:
- 6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H) look like two doublets, each integrating to 2H. These are probably from two aromatic rings, each with two equivalent protons. Maybe para-substituted benzene rings.

Wait, the 6.27 ppm peak is a broad singlet for 2H. Broad singlet could indicate some exchange, maybe an enol proton or something with OH groups, but since it's 2H, perhaps vinyl protons adjacent to something de-shielded, like an electron-withdrawing group.

The 3.66 ppm peak is a doublet of 2H. That's probably a methylene group (CH2) adjacent to an electronegative atom. Maybe oxygen, like an ether or alkoxy group. So perhaps a -OCH2- group.

Putting this together, maybe the molecule has two benzene rings connected to a central chain. Let's think about possible structures.

Looking at the molecular formula: C8H9NO. That's 8 carbons, 9 hydrogens, one nitrogen, and one oxygen.

Wait, if there are two benzene rings (each 6 carbons), but that would be 12 carbons. Oh wait, no, the formula is C8, so maybe one benzene ring and another group. Wait, perhaps a diphenyl compound but with a shorter chain.

Wait, another approach: the formula can be broken down. Let's calculate the degree of unsaturation. For C8H9NO:

Degrees of unsaturation = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. X is 0 here, so:

(2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9+1)/2 = 10/2=5.

Five degrees of unsaturation. That could be two benzene rings (each contributes 3, so 6 total?), but wait, no, wait each benzene is 3 (each ring is one, each double bond is another). Alternatively, maybe
