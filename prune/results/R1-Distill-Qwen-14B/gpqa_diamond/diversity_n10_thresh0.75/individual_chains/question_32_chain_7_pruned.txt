Okay, so I have this physics problem to solve, and I want to make sure I think it through properly. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question is about finding the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) such that the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96c. The nucleus X is defined as Li with 3 neutrons. Hmm, wait, Li is lithium, right? So, lithium typically has 3 protons. If it has 3 neutrons, then the isotope would be Li-6 because 3 protons + 3 neutrons = 6 nucleons. So the mass number is 6.

So the nucleus is Li-6. I need to find its energy when moving at 0.96c. I remember that in relativity, the energy of a particle isn't just kinetic; it includes the rest mass energy as well. But wait, the question might be asking for the total energy or just the kinetic energy. Let me think. The question says, "the energy of the RHIC so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c." RHIC accelerators typically provide the necessary energy to reach a certain speed, so I think the question is asking for the total energy, which is the sum of rest mass energy and kinetic energy. Alternatively, sometimes in these contexts, they might refer to the kinetic energy directly. Hmm. I'll have to keep that in mind.

Wait, the problem is about the energy the collider imparts. So when a particle is accelerated to a certain speed, the energy it has is the total energy, which is γ times the rest energy. But sometimes, the kinetic energy is considered, which is (γ-1) times the rest energy. So I need to clarify what the question is asking.

The question says, "the energy of the RHIC so that the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96c." So, I think it's the total energy, because the energy provided by the collider is the total energy, not just the kinetic part. Because the kinetic energy is the extra energy beyond rest mass. So, I'll proceed under that assumption.

First, I need to find the total energy E = γ * m₀c², where m₀ is the rest mass of the nucleus.

So I need to calculate γ. The formula for gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Given v =
