Okay, I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let me read it carefully and think through each step. So, the question is about a series of reactions starting from 1,3-dibromoadamantane, and we need to determine the coupling pattern of a specific hydrogen in the final product.

First, let's break down each step.

Step 1: Heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with excess KOH at 240°C. I remember that when vicinal dihalides (two halogens on adjacent carbons) react with a strong base like KOH, they undergo an elimination reaction to form an alkene. Oh wait, but wait—1,3-dibromoadamantane has bromine atoms on carbons 1 and 3 of the adamantane structure. Hmm, wait, the structure of adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so if the bromines are on 1 and 3, are those adjacent? Let me visualize. Adamantane has a structure similar to diamond, with each carbon connected to three others. So positions 1 and 3 might be two carbons apart, but I'm not sure if they're adjacent. Wait, no, if the molecule is 1,3-dibromo, then the two Brs are on carbons that are two apart, not adjacent. So elimination would require adjacent Brs. Wait, maybe I'm wrong. Wait, perhaps when KOH is used in such conditions, it's a dehydrohalogenation. So if the two Brs are on adjacent carbons, then elimination would form a double bond. But if they're not adjacent, maybe it's a different reaction?

Wait, wait, no. 1,3-dibromoadamantane—so the bromines are on carbons 1 and 3. So they are two apart. But for elimination (E2), the halogens need to be on adjacent carbons because the hydrogen is abstracted from a neighboring carbon. So if they're on 1 and 3, maybe they can't eliminate to form a double bond because they're not adjacent. Hmm, that suggests that maybe I'm misunderstanding the structure. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction isn't elimination but something else.

Wait, but wait. Maybe it's an example of a Hofmann elimination or some other process. Or perhaps there's a different structure. Alternatively, I might be mixing up the positions. Let me think again. Adamantane is a diamondoid structure with four cyclohexane rings. Each carbon in adamantane is
