Okay, so I've got this question about the Michael addition reaction, and I'm a bit rusty on my organic chemistry, but I'll try to think it through. Let me start by understanding what's being asked here.

The question has three parts, each a Michael addition reaction. I need to figure out the reactants and major products for each, and then match them to the options given. The options are labeled A, B, C, D, each with different products A, B, and C.

First, let me recall what the Michael addition is. From what I remember, the Michael reaction involves the attack of a nucleophile (enolate ion) on an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl compound. The enolate acts as a nucleophile, attacking the beta position of the unsaturated carbonyl, leading to a conjugate addition.

So, each of the given reactions is a Michael addition. Let's take them one by one.

Reaction 1: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) â†’ A

Okay, the reagents here are NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) in ethanol. Sodium ethoxide is a strong base, so it's likely deprotonating the malonate to form an enolate. The enolate will attack the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl.

Dimethyl malonate is (CH3CO)2CH2, but wait, no. Wait, malonate is CH2(COOCH3)2. So, when deprotonated, it forms an enolate. The enolate will have a negative charge on the central carbon.

The other reactant is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Let me draw its structure. The acrylate part is CH2-CH2-CO-OCH3, but wait, acrylate is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3. Wait, no. Wait, 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH-C(O)OCH2-p-tolyl? No, wait. The structure is CH2=CH-C(=O)-OCH2-p-tolyl? Or wait, the substituent is on the acrylate. So methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is CH2=C(C6H4-p-tolyl)-COOCH3. No, wait, the numbering is a bit confusing. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOOR. So '3-(p-tolyl)' would be the substituent on the CH2 or CH group. Wait, the substituent is on the acrylate's third carbon. Wait, acrylate is CH2=CH-COOR. So the carbons are 1 (CH2), 2 (CH), 3 (COOR). So 3-(p-tolyl) would be a substituent on the third carbon, which is the carbonyl group. That doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=CH-C(O)-OCH2-p-tolyl? No, maybe
