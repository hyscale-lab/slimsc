Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about the Michael addition reaction, and I need to figure out the correct products for each part. Let me start by recalling what the Michael addition is. From what I remember, the Michael reaction is a conjugate addition where a nucleophile (like an enolate) attacks the beta position of an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. This results in the formation of a new carbon-carbon bond.

The question has three different reactions labeled A, B, and C. I need to determine the products for each and match them with the given options. Let me tackle each part one by one.

Starting with reaction A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate in the presence of NaOEt and EtOH. Dimethyl malonate is a known Michael donor because it can form an enolate. The enolate will attack the beta position of the alpha-beta unsaturated ester.

So, dimethyl malonate has the structure (CH3COO)2CH-. When deprotonated, it forms an enolate which has a negative charge on the alpha carbon. The (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OEt. Wait, no, the structure is more accurately CH2=C(p-tolyl)COOEt. No, wait, the formula is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, which would be CH2=C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3. No, wait, wait. Let me think again. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOOEt. But here, the substituent is at the 3 position. Wait, the formula is methyl 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. So the structure is CH2=C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3. Wait, no, acrylate is CH2=CHCOOR. If it's 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, then the substituent is on the third carbon, but wait, acrylate is only three carbons. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me clarify: acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-. So for methyl, it's CH
