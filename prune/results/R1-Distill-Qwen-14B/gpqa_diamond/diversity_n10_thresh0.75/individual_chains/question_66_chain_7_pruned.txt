Okay, so I have this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Hmm, I remember that SMEFT is an effective theory that includes all possible higher-dimensional operators consistent with the Standard Model symmetries. But wait, what symmetries are those?

The question lists four symmetries and asks which must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are combinations of Lorentz (1), Poincare (2), CP (3), and CPT (4). 

Wait, what's the difference between Lorentz and Poincare symmetry? Oh right, Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. So if the theory respects Poincare, it automatically respects Lorentz as well. But SMEFT is a field theory, right? Field theories usually have Poincare symmetry. So Poincare must be a symmetry that SMEFT respects.

Wait, but the question is about which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So if a symmetry is part of the underlying theory, the operators must respect it.

So SMEFT is built from the Standard Model. The Standard Model has certain symmetries. The SM has Poincare symmetry, sure. But what about C, P, T, and CPT?

Wait, the SM respects CPT symmetry. CPT is a combination of charge conjugation, parity, and time reversal. But the SM doesn't necessarily respect CP or T individually. For example, the SM includes CP violation in the CKM matrix.

So in SMEFT, operators must respect the symmetries of the SM. So which of these symmetries are part of the SM
