Okay, so I've got this question here about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius 2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity, but let me think this through.

The metric given is ds² = [32 / (4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Wait, so that's in two dimensions, right? Because it's only got dx and dy. So this is a 2-dimensional spacetime? Or maybe a surface embedded in some higher dimension. But the question is about a pseudosphere, which I think is a type of surface with constant negative curvature. Oh wait, pseudosphere is usually a term used in geometry, like the tractricoid, which is a surface with constant negative curvature. But in this context, maybe it's a 2-dimensional Lorentzian manifold? Or perhaps it's a Riemannian metric but with some negative features.

Wait, the question is about the area of a pseudosphere of radius r=2. Wait, pseudospheres are surfaces of constant negative curvature, but in 2D. The area of a pseudosphere is known to be finite, but I think it's actually infinite because as you go to the "north pole" or something, the area might diverge... Wait, no, that's for a sphere. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I should first figure out what kind of metric this is. The line element is ds² = (32 / (4 - x² - y²)) (dx² + dy²). Let me see, so the denominator is 4 - x² - y². If the denominator approaches zero, that would mean the metric blows up. So the region where 4 - x² - y² > 0 is allowed, because otherwise the metric would be undefined. So the domain is x² + y² < 4. So it's a disk of radius 2 in the x-y plane. Wait, but the question is about a pseudosphere, which is a surface. Hmm.

Wait, maybe this metric represents a pseudosphere in some way. Alternatively, perhaps this is a 2-dimensional surface embedded in a higher-dimensional space. But I'm not sure. Wait, another approach: in 2D, the area can be found using the standard area element formula in differential geometry. The area is the integral of the square root of the determinant of the metric tensor times dθ or something. Wait, the area of a 2D surface with metric ds² = g_{xx} dx² + 2 g_{xy} dx dy + g_{yy} dy² is given by the integral over the surface of sqrt(det(g)) dx dy. But in this case, the metric is diagonal, so g_{xy} =0 since the cross terms are zero. So the determinant is (g_{xx} * g_{yy} - 0) = (32/(4 - x² - y²))². Wait, no, determinant for a diagonal metric is simply the product of the diagonal terms. So det(g) = (32/(4 - x² - y²))².

Wait, so the area element would be sqrt(det(g)) dx dy. That is sqrt( (32/(4 - x² - y²))² ) dx dy. The square root of a square is the absolute value, so that's 32/(4 - x² - y²) dx dy. So the area A is the integral over the domain of 32/(4 - x² - y²) dx dy.

Wait, but the domain is x² + y² < 4, right? Because the denominator is 4 - x² - y², which must be positive.

So A = ∫∫ [32 / (4 - x² - y²)] dx dy, where the integration is over x² + y² < 4.

Hmm, but integrating that might be tricky. Let me think about switching to polar coordinates since the integrand and the domain are radially symmetric. So x² + y² = r², and dx dy becomes r dr dθ.

So substituting, the integral becomes:

A = ∫ (θ=0 to 2π) ∫ (r=0 to 2) [32 / (4 - r²)] * r dr dθ.

Because the denominator becomes 4 - r² when we switch to polar coordinates. So that's the setup.

Let me compute the radial integral first. Let me take out the constants. 32 is a constant, and the integral over θ is just 2π. So:

A = 32 * 2π * ∫ (r=0 to 2) [r / (4 - r²)] dr.

Wait, so that's 64 π ∫ [r/(4 - r²)] dr from 0 to 2.

Let me compute the integral ∫ [r/(4 - r²)] dr. Hmm, substitution time. Let u = 4 - r². Then du/dr = -2r → -du/2 = r dr.

So the integral becomes ∫ [r dr/(4 - r²)] = ∫ (-du/2) / u = (-1/2) ∫ du/u = (-1/2) ln |u| + C.

So putting the limits in:

At r=2: u = 4 - (2)^2 = 0. At r=0: u=4.

So the integral from 0 to 2 is [ (-1/2) ln(0) ) - ( (-1/2) ln(4) ) ]

Wait, but ln(0) is negative infinity. Wait, wait, u approaches 0 from the positive side since r approaches 2 from below. So when r approaches 2, u approaches 0, and ln(u) approaches negative infinity.

So the integral becomes:

( -1/2 [ ln(0) - ln(4) ] ) = (-1/2) [ (-∞) - ln(4) ) ] → (-1/2)(-∞) = +∞.

Wait, that means the integral diverges to infinity. So the area A is 64 π * ∞, which is infinite. So the area is infinite. But wait, that can't be right. I must have made a mistake because the pseudosphere is a surface of finite area. Hmm.

Wait, but wait, maybe I'm confusing the 2D surface area with the 3D pseudosphere. Wait, in 2D, the metric is given, but the pseudosphere is a 2D surface. So perhaps the area is infinite. But wait, the metric is defined on a disk of radius 2, which is finite. So how can the area be infinite?

Alternatively, perhaps the metric is that of a pseudosphere, but the calculation says the area is infinite. But in reality, the area of a pseudosphere is 4π r², like a regular sphere, but wait, no. Wait, a regular sphere has area 4π r², but a pseudosphere (tractricoid) has finite area. Wait, let me think again. The tractricoid, which is the surface of a pseudosphere, has finite area. But in our calculation, the area is diverging. So maybe our approach is wrong.

Wait, but the question isn't about the tractricoid. It's about the metric given, which is a 2D metric. So perhaps for this specific metric, the area is infinite.

Wait, the options include D) +infty. So if my calculation leads to the area being infinite, then the answer would be D.

But wait, why does the integral diverge? Let's check the limits again. As r approaches 2, the denominator 4 - r² approaches zero, so the integrand becomes (r/(4 - r²)) approaches (r approaches 2) → 2/(0) → infinity. So the integrand near r=2 behaves like 2/(0), so it's a 1/r² behavior? Wait, no, 4 - r² = (2 - r)(2 + r). Near r=2, 4 - r² ≈ 4 - (2 + ε)^2 = 4 - (4 +4ε + ε²) = -4ε.

Wait, but as r approaches 2 from below, 4 - r² approaches 0 from positive? No, because r is less than 2, so 4 - r² is positive. So when r approaches 2, 4 - r² approaches 0 from the positive side. So the denominator becomes very small, and the integrand becomes large.

So the integral ∫ (from 0 to 2) r/(4 - r²) dr.

As r approaches 2, the denominator approaches 0, so the integrand behaves like [r/(4 - r²)] ≈ 2/(4 -4) → 2/(0) → infinity.

So the integral near r=2 behaves like [ r/(4 - r²) ] ~ 2/( (2 - r)(2 + r) ) → since r is near 2, 2 + r approaches 4. So denominator is ~ (2 - r) * 4. So the integrand ~ 2/(4*(2 - r)) ) = 1/(2*(2 - r)).

So the integral near r=2 is approximately ∫ [1/(2*(2 - r))] dr. Let me make substitution u = 2 - r → du = -dr. When r approaches 2, u approaches 0.

So the integral becomes ∫ [1/(2u)] (-du) from u=0 to u= ε, where ε is a small positive number. So the integral is ∫ (from 0 to ε) [1/(2u)] du → (1/2) ∫ (1/u) du = (1/2) [ln u ] from 0 to ε. That evaluates to (1/2)(ln ε - ln 0) → (1/2)( ln ε - (-infty) ) → (1/2)(+infty) → infty.

So the integral diverges, meaning the area is infinite.

But wait, the question is about the area of the pseudosphere of radius 2. So if the metric given is that of a pseudosphere, but the area comes out to be infinite, then the answer would be D) +infty.

But wait, in reality, a pseudosphere (tractricoid) has finite area. So why is this metric giving an infinite area?

Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the concept. Wait, perhaps the metric is not that of a pseudosphere but of a sphere with a certain radius. Wait, let me think about the metric.

Let me write the metric again: ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). So let me see, the coefficient is 32/(4 - r²), where r = sqrt(x² + y²).

So in polar coordinates, the metric is ds² = (32/(4 - r²)) r² dr² + (32/(4 - r²)) dθ².

Wait, wait no, actually, no. Wait, in polar coordinates, the standard metric is dr² + r² dθ². But in this case, the given metric is [32/(4 - r²)] (dx² + dy²), which in polar is [32/(4 - r²)] (dr² + r² dθ²). So it's ds² = (32/(4 - r²)) dr² + (32 r²/(4 - r²)) dθ².

So the line element is:

ds² = [32/(4 - r²)] dr² + [32 r²/(4 - r²)] dθ².

So the metric tensor components are g_rr = 32/(4 - r²), g_θθ = 32 r²/(4 - r²), and the cross terms are zero.

Wait, but the area in 2D is calculated as the integral of sqrt(det g) dθ dr. Wait, no, wait, the area element in polar coordinates for a metric like this would be sqrt( g_rr * g_θθ - (g_rθ)^2 ) dr dθ. But since g_rθ is zero, the area element is sqrt( g_rr * g_θθ ) dr dθ.

So that's sqrt( [32/(4 - r²)] * [32 r²/(4 - r²)] ) = sqrt( (32 * 32 r²) / (4 - r²)^2 ) = (32 r) / (4 - r²).

So the area A is the integral from r=0 to 2 of integral θ=0 to 2π of [32 r/(4 - r²)] dr dθ.

Which is 2π * 32 ∫ (r=0 to 2) [r/(4 - r²)] dr.

Wait, that's the same integral as before. So the area is 64 π ∫ [r/(4 - r²)] dr from 0 to 2, which we saw diverges. So the area is infinite.

Hmm, but why would a pseudosphere have an infinite area? Because when I think about the tractricoid, it's a finite area. So perhaps the given metric isn't a pseudosphere but something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the radius is 2, but maybe that's a different scaling factor. Let me think about the metric of a pseudosphere. The tractricoid is a surface of constant negative curvature. The metric for a surface of revolution with constant curvature can be written in terms of the radius and the curvature.

Wait, for a surface of revolution with constant negative curvature, the metric in polar coordinates (r, θ) is:

ds² = dr² + (a² / (1 + (r²)/(a²)))² dθ²,

where a is a constant related to the curvature. Wait, I'm not sure about the exact form. Alternatively, the metric may have a different expression.

Alternatively, perhaps the metric given is for a sphere, but with a different radius. Wait, but the denominator is 4 - r², so when r approaches 2, the denominator approaches zero, which suggests a singularity. So maybe this is a model of hyperbolic geometry, like the Poincaré disk model, which is a conformal mapping of the hyperbolic plane to the unit disk. In that case, the metric is similar, but scaled.

Wait, the Poincaré disk model for hyperbolic geometry has a metric:

ds² = [4/(1 - r²)^2] (dr² + r² dθ²),

where r is the radius in the Poincaré disk (r < 1). So in that case, the area integral would be:

A = ∫∫ sqrt( [4/(1 - r²)^2] ) r dr dθ,

which is ∫0^{2π} ∫0^1 [4/(1 - r²)] r dr dθ.

Which also diverges because as r approaches 1, the denominator approaches zero. So the area of the hyperbolic plane in the Poincaré disk model is infinite.

So if our metric is similar, then the area is infinite. So the given metric is perhaps a scaled version of the Poincaré disk, but with a different radius.

In our case, the denominator is 4 - r², which means the radius is 2 instead of 1. So the area still diverges.

Therefore, the area of the pseudosphere (if this is the metric of a pseudosphere) would be infinite. But wait, no, because a pseudosphere is a finite surface. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused between 2D surfaces and higher dimensions. Wait, the given metric is 2D, so it's a surface, but the pseudosphere is a 2D surface, which, in reality, has finite area. So why is the integral telling me it's infinite?

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me reevaluate the integral.

The integral is ∫ [r/(4 - r²)] dr from 0 to 2.

Wait, let me compute the integral exactly.

Let me compute ∫ [r/(4 - r²)] dr.

Let u = 4 - r² → du = -2r dr → ( -1/2 ) du = r dr.

So the integral becomes ∫ [r/(4 - r²)] dr = ∫ [r dr/(u)] = ∫ (-1/2) du/u = (-1/2) ln |u| + C.

Putting limits: from r=0 (u=4) to r=2 (u=0).

So it's (-1/2) [ ln(0) - ln(4) ].

But ln(0) is negative infinity, so the expression becomes (-1/2) [ (-infty) - ln(4) ] = (-1/2)(-infty) = +infty.

So the integral is indeed divergent, leading to an infinite area. So the conclusion is that the area is infinite.

Looking back at the options, option D is +infty. So the answer should be D.


The given metric is:

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left(dx^2 + dy^2\right),
\]

which is defined for \(x^2 + y^2 < 4\), corresponding to a disk of radius 2 in the \(x\)-\(y\) plane. To compute the area of the surface described by this metric, we use the standard formula for the area element in differential geometry:

\[
A = \int \int \sqrt{\det(g)} \, dx \, dy,
\]

where \(g\) is the metric tensor. For this metric, the determinant of \(g\) is:

\[
\det(g) = \left(\frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2}\right)^2.
\]

Thus, the area element becomes:

\[
dA = \sqrt{\det(g)} \, dx \, dy = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \, dx \, dy.
\]

Switching to polar coordinates (\(x^2 + y^2 = r^2\), \(dx \, dy = r \, dr \, d\theta\)), the area integral becomes:

\[
A = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^2 \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \cdot r \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

The integral over \(\theta\) is straightforward:

\[
\int_0^{2\pi} d\theta = 2\pi.
\]

Thus, the area reduces to:

\[
A = 64\pi \int_0^2 \frac{r}{4 - r^2} \, dr.
\]

To evaluate the radial integral, we use the substitution \(u = 4 - r^2\), \(du = -2r \, dr\), which gives:

\[
\int \frac{r}{4 - r^2} \, dr = -\frac{1}{2} \int \frac{du}{u} = -\frac{1}{2} \ln|u| + C.
\]

Applying the limits \(r = 0\) (\(u = 4\)) to \(r = 2\) (\(u = 0\)):

\[
\int_0^2 \frac{r}{4 - r^2} \, dr = -\frac{1}{2} \left[\ln(0) - \ln(4)\right].
\]

Since \(\ln(0) \to -\infty\), the integral diverges to infinity. Therefore, the area \(A\) is infinite. This result indicates that the surface described by the given metric has an infinite area.

Given the options:

- **A) 0**: Incorrect, as the area is clearly not zero.
- **B) \(4\pi(x^2 + y^2)\)**: Incorrect, as this is not a valid expression for the area.
- **C) \(4\pi(x^2 - y^2)\)**: Incorrect, as this is not a valid expression for the area.
- **D) \(+\infty\)**: Correct, as the integral diverges, leading to an infinite area.

Thus, the area of the pseudosphere described by the given metric is infinite.

Answer: D
