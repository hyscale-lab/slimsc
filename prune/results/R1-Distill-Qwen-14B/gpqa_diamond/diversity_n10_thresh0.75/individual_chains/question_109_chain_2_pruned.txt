Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me about nucleons and particles, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let me read it carefully.

The question says: We have two nucleons in a 1S0 state, which emit a particle X of intrinsic parity -1. Pauli statistics require that the isospin, angular momentum, and spin quantum numbers of the final NN state satisfy T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2). 

Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on Pauli's exclusion principle here. Oh wait, Pauli's statistics apply to identical fermions. So the two nucleons must obey the exclusion principle. But wait, the problem is about the final state after emitting a particle. Hmm.

The final NN state has T(NN) = 0. I think T is the isospin. So the isospin of the two nucleons after emission is zero. The question is about which partial wave is not permitted. The options are about different transitions involving emitting a particle X with certain quantum numbers.

The problem tells me to consider both angular momentum and parity conservation. So I need to look at both factors when determining which partial wave isn't allowed.

Let me break down what I know. The initial state is 1S0. The 1S0 notation means that the total spin S is 0 (because 1S0 implies (2S+1) =1, so S=0). The orbital angular momentum L is 0 (since it's S state, spectroscopic notation), so L=0. The total angular momentum J is 0, because J = L + S, which is 0+0=0.

So the initial state has S=0, L=0, J=0.

The system emits a particle X. So the initial state is the two nucleons in 1S0, and then they emit X, becoming the final state NN plus X. Wait, no, wait the question says the NN state emits a particle X, so perhaps the NN are in the initial state, and after emission, the NN are in a different state. Wait, the initial state is 1S0, and after emission, the NN state has T=0. So the initial NN is 1S0, and then becomes some other state with T=0. So perhaps the particle X is emitted, and the NN system transitions to a state with T=0.

Wait, the problem states that the NN system is in a
