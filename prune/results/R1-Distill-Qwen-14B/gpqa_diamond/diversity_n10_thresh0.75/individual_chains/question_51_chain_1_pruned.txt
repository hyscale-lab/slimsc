Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric potential energy. Let me think through it step by step. Hmm, the question says that a charge q is placed a distance d away from the center of a grounded conducting sphere with radius R. I'm supposed to find the net potential energy of the system.

Wait, I remember that when dealing with conductors, especially grounded ones, induced charges come into play. Oh right, the conducting sphere will have induced charges on its surface because the external charge q induces opposite and then like charges. Since the sphere is grounded, it can lose electrons or gain them, so the induced charge will adjust accordingly.

So, when a charge q is placed near the sphere, the conductor's electrons redistribute. The sphere being a conductor means the charges will be on the surface. The charge q induces a charge of -q on the near side of the sphere and +q on the far side, but wait, no. Wait, no, the induced charge would be such that it creates an electric field that cancels the external field inside the conductor. Hmm, maybe I should think about image charges.

Oh, right! There's something called the method of images, especially for spheres. The conducting sphere can be treated as having an image charge inside. Wait, I think when a charge is outside a conducting sphere, the induced charges can be modeled by an image charge inside the sphere.

So for a conducting sphere of radius R, the image charge q' would be located at a distance of d' from the center, where d' is R²/d. Because the image charge's position is given by (R²)/d, since d is the distance from the charge to the center.

Wait, let me get this right. The formula for the image charge when a point charge is outside a conducting sphere is q' = -q (R/d)²? Or is it R²/d? No, I think the image charge is located at a distance of R²/d from the center, towards the charge. Because if the original charge is at d, then the image is at R²/d. So the distance between q and the image charge would be d - (R²/d) = (d² - R²)/d. Wait, not sure about that.

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of potentials. The potential energy of the system would be due to the work done in bringing the charge q to that position, considering the induced charges on the sphere.

But the sphere is grounded, so the potential on its surface must be
