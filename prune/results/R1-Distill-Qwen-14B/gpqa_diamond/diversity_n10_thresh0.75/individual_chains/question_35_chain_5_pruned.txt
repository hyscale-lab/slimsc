Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem, and I'm a bit unsure where to start, but let's break it down step by step. The question is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator Ay, which is defined as c times the matrix S. 

First, let me understand what each component is. The operator Ay is given by c multiplied by the matrix S. The constant c is h/4π, where h is Planck's constant. The matrix S has the first row as (0, -i) and the second row as (i, 0). So, S looks like this:

S = | 0   -i |
    | i    0 |

And Ay is c multiplied by S, so Ay = c * S.

Wait, but the question says to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. So I need to solve Ay |φ> = a |φ>, where a is the eigenvalue.

But before that, perhaps I should compute the matrix representation of Ay. Let me compute that. Since c is a scalar, I can multiply each element of S by c.

So Ay's matrix becomes:
Ay = c * S = (h/4π) * S

Which would be:
[ [ (h/4π)*0 , (h/4π)*(-i) ],
  [ (h/4π)*(i) , (h/4π)*0 ] ]

Simplify that:
= [ [0, (-i h)/(4π) ], 
    [ (i h)/(4π), 0 ] ]

So, the matrix is:
[ [0, (-i h)/(4π)],
  [ (i h)/(4π), 0 ] ]

Now, to find the eigenvalues a, I need to solve the characteristic equation det(Ay - a I) = 0.

The matrix Ay - a I is:
[ [ -a , (-i h)/(4π) ],
  [ (i h)/(4π), -a ] ]

The determinant is (-a)(-a) - [ (-i h/(4π)) * (i h/(4π)) ) ]

Calculating each part:

The product of the off-diagonal elements: (-i h/(4π)) * (i h/(4π)) 
Let me compute that. Let's write it as:

(-i)*(i) = (-i^2) = -(-1) = 1. Because i^2 is -1, so negative times negative is positive. Wait, no, wait: (-i)*i = -i^2. i^2 is -1, so this becomes -(-1) = 1.

So the product is (h^2)/( (4π)^2 ) * 1.

So determinant is a² - (h²)/(16 π²) = 0.

Setting this equal to zero: a² = (h²)/(16 π²) → a = ± h/(4π) * (1/2) ? Wait, wait, let me compute.

Wait, no. Let me recompute the determinant:

The determinant is (a)(a) - [ (-i h/(4π)) * (i h/(4π)) ] = a² - [ ( (-i)*(i) ) * (h^2)/(16 π²) ) ]

What's (-i)*(i)? That's (-i²) = -(-1) = 1. So the second term is 1 * (h²)/(16 π²).

So the equation is a² - (h²)/(16 π²) = 0 → a² = (h²)/(16 π²) → a = ± (h)/(4π) * (1/2) )? Wait, no: sqrt( h²/(16 π²) ) is h/(4π). So a = ± h/(4π).

Wait, that can't be right. Because when I take the square root of (h^2/(16 π^2)), it's h/(4π). So yes, the eigenvalues a are plus or minus h/(4π).

Wait, but wait another
