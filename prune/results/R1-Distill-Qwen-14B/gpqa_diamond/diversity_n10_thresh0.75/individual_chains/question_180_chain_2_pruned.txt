Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. The question is about an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. Wait, e is the elementary charge, right? So each has 2 times that. But 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P, and the 13th charge is fixed at P. I need to find the minimum energy of this system.

Hmm, energy in an electrostatic system usually refers to the electric potential energy. I remember that the potential energy of a system of point charges is the work required to assemble them, bringing each charge from infinity to their positions. And since the system is isolated, I don't think external fields are influencing it, just the charges themselves.

Wait, so the system has 13 charges. The 13th is fixed at point P. The other 12 are each 2 meters away from P. So each of these 12 is 2 meters from P, but what about their distances from each other? Oh, wait, the problem states they are constrained to stay at 2 m from P, but it's not clear if they're all at the same point or spread out on a sphere. Oh, wait, no, because if they were all at the same point, the potential energy would be different. But wait, no, if they are all at the same point, the distances between them would be zero, which would mean infinite potential energy. That can't be
