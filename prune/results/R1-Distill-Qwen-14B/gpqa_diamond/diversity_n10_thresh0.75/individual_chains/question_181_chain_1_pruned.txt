Okay, so I've got this question about neutrinos from the Sun and what happens when the pp-III branch stops. Hmm. Let me try to think through this step by step.

First, I remember that the Sun's core produces neutrinos through various processes, mainly the proton-proton chain, which has different branches. The pp-III branch is one of them, I think. I'm not entirely sure about the specifics, but I remember that the main proton-proton chain, pp-I, is the dominant process, especially at lower temperatures. Oh wait, wait, no, I think pp-I is actually the dominant one in the Sun's core because it's the main fusion pathway for hydrogen into helium.

But the question is about the pp-III branch. Wait, what does the pp-III branch do? I think the pp chain has several branches, but pp-III might involve higher energy reactions, maybe at higher temperatures? Or perhaps it's a different pathway where three protons fuse in a different way. I'm a bit fuzzy on the details, but I think that the pp-III branch is a minor contributor compared to pp-I.

The question says that the pp-III branch suddenly stops about 8.5 minutes ago. Wait, 8.5 minutes is the approximate time it takes for light to travel from the Sun's core to the Earth. So, if something happens in the core, like the pp-III stopping, the neutrinos would be affected immediately because neutrinos escape almost at the speed of light, right? So 8.5 minutes later, we on Earth would notice the change in the neutrino flux.

But what's the effect of stopping pp-III? Neutr
