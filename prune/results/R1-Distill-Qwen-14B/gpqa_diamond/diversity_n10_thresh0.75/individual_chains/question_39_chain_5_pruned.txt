Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let's see what it's about. The question is about finding the value of 'a' in the wave function of a particle. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Oh wait, and the conditions are that when measuring the position, particles are only found between x=1 and x=3. So, the wave function must be zero outside this region, right?

Wait, no, wait. Actually, the wave function is non-zero only in the region where the particle can be found. So, in this case, only between x=1 and x=3. So that means the wave function must be zero outside that interval, but wait the given wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Because if the wave function is non-zero only between 1 and 3, then outside, the wave function should be zero. But the given function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So perhaps this function is only valid between 1 and 3, and zero otherwise? Or maybe it's valid in that region and not elsewhere.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The wave function is given, and we have to normalize it. Because in quantum mechanics, the integral of the absolute square of the wave function over all space must equal 1. So the normalization condition is important here.

The wave function is Ïˆ(x) = (a / sqrt(1+x)) -
