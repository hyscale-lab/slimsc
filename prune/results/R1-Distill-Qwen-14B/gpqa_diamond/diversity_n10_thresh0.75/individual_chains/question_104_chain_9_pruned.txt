Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I remember that the radial velocity (RV) method detects planets by measuring the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum as the planet's gravity causes the star to wobble. The bigger the shift, the more massive the planet or the closer it is to the star, I think.

The question says that two stars have the same mass, each about like our Sun. Each has a planet with mass similar to Neptune. Both are in circular orbits. But the RV shifts are different: 5 milliangstrom for planet 1, and 7 for planet 2.

Wait, the question is about the orbital periods. They're asking how many times longer planet 2's period is compared to planet 1's. So I need to find the ratio Period2 / Period1.

I remember the formula for the RV method. The semi-amplitude K of the Doppler shift is given by some formula involving the mass of the planet, the mass of the star, the orbital period, and the distance. Or maybe it's Kepler's third law involved here.

Wait, the formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is K = (v * sin i) where v is the star's velocity, but how does that relate to the planet's orbital period?

Alternatively, I think the formula for K is K = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) ) ) ] * (1 / (P^(1/3) * c) )) * ( sin i ) )

Wait, but the star's mass is much larger than the planet's, so M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. Since both stars have the same mass as the Sun, and the planets are Neptune-like, their masses are much smaller, so M_star is same for both stars. So maybe we can ignore M_p compared to M_star.

Also, the orbital period P is the same in both cases? No, wait, no, the question is about different periods. So let's think about how K relates to P.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. The Doppler shift (K) is related to the star's velocity, which is due to the planet's orbit. The formula is K = ( (2π G )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) ) / ( (M_star^(2/3)) * c ) ) * (1 / P^(1/3) )

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to consider the relation between K and P. Since K is inversely related to P^(1/3). Because in the formula, K is proportional to (1 / P^(1/3)). So if K increases, P decreases.

Wait, let me structure this. So K is proportional to (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(1/3) * P^(1/3) ) ) * (1/c ), but c is a constant. Since both planets have same mass and same sin i (assuming i is same, but the question doesn't say, but maybe it's negligible as it's same for both), so K ∝ 1 / (P^(1/3)).

So if K1 is the velocity amplitude for planet 1, and K2 for planet 2, then K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3) ) ?

Wait, wait, no. Because K is proportional to 1 / P^(1/3), so K1 = (something)/P1^(1/3), same for K2. So K1/K2 = (P2 / P1)^(1/3) )

Wait, no, wait. Let me double-check. Let me write K1 = (A) * (1 / P1^(1/3) ), K2 = (A) * (1 / P2^(1/3) ), where A is some proportionality factor that depends on other things (like M_p, M_star, sin i, etc.), which are same for both planets.

So K1/K2 = (1 / P1^(1/3)) / (1 / P2^(1/3) ) ) = (P2/P1)^(1/3 )

So solving for P2/P1, that's (K1/K2)^3.

Wait, no. Let me take it step by step.

If K1 = (A) / (P1^(1/3) )

Similarly, K2 = (A) / (P2^(1/3) )

So K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3 )

Then, (K1/K2) = (P2/P1)^(1/3 )

So to find P2/P1, we cube both sides: (K1/K2)^3 = P2/P1.

Wait no, wait: K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3 )

So (K1/K2)^3 = (P2/P1 )

So P2 = P1 * (K1/K2)^3.

Wait no, wait, (K1/K2) = (P2/P1 )^(1/3
