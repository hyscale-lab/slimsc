Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem, and I want to make sure I understand it correctly. Let's break it down step by step. 

So, the question is about the radial velocity (RV) method used to detect exoplanets. The setup is that there are two stars with the same mass as the Sun, and each has a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. 

The key data given is the periodic shifts in the spectral lines of the stars. For Planet #1, the shift is up to 5 milliangstroms, and for Planet #2, it's 7 milliangstroms. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1.

Hmm, I remember that the RV method detects planets by measuring the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum. As the planet orbits, the star moves slightly in the opposite direction, causing the spectral lines to shift back and forth. The shift depends on the mass of the planet and the orbital period, among other factors.

Wait, so what determines the RV signal? I think the formula for the semi-amplitude of the RV (K) is given by K = (v0) * (M_p sin i) / (M_star)^(1/3) * (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3) ... no, wait, maybe I'm mixing up some terms. Alternatively, I recall that K is proportional to (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(1/3) * (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3)). But since the planet masses are much smaller than the star, M_p << M_star, so the denominator simplifies. Let me think again.

The formula is K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / (c * (M_star + M_p) ) )^(1/3) ) * ( (2π G) / (P (M_star + M_p) ) )^(1/3) ) ... Hmm, maybe I should approach this differently.

Wait, the RV semi-amplitude K is given by K = [ (G * (M_p) * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * (1 day^2 * (2π)^2 ) )^(1/3) ) ] * (something) ... Wait, perhaps it's easier to use the simplified version when M_p is much less than M_star, which it is in this case. So, K ≈ ( (2π G) / (P c) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / M_star^(2/3) )

Wait, maybe I should look for the relationship between the RV semi-amplitude and the orbital period. Let me think about the formula again. Oh right, the RV semi-amplitude K is given by the formula:

K = ( (G * M_p * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) * (1 - e^2)^(1/2) ) ) )^(1/3) * (2π / (P * c))^(1/3)

But since e is zero (circular orbits), and M_p << M_star, M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. So the formula simplifies to:

K ≈ ( (G * M_p * sin i) / (M_star^(1/3)) ) / ( (2π G * P )^(1/3) * c ) )

Wait, maybe I should find a way to relate K to the orbital period. Let me think about the relation between the two. 

I remember that for a circular orbit, the RV semi-amplitude K is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital period. Wait, no, maybe it's more precise to think about the proportionality between K and the orbital period.

Wait, let's think about how K depends on the period. The RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v * (M_p sin i)) / (M_star) 

Wait, no, that's probably not right. Another approach: the Doppler shift depends on the velocity of the star. The star's velocity is related to the planet's orbit. 

The star's velocity is given by v = (2π a) / P, where a is the semi-major axis, and P is the period. But for a planet, the semi-major axis a is related to the orbital period via Kepler's third law: P² = (4π²/G(M_star + M_p)) a³. Since M_p is much smaller than M_star, this simplifies to P² ≈ (4π²/(G M_star)) a³. 

So, substituting a from Kepler's law into the velocity equation: v = (2π a)/P = (2π ( (G M_star P²/(4π²) )^(1/3) )) ) / P 

Simplify this:

v = (2π) * (G M_star)^(1/3)
