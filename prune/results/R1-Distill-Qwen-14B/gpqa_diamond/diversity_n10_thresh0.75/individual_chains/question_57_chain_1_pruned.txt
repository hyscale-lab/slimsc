Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about elastic scattering of electrons from a nuclear target. The question is about calculating the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

Alright, the problem gives me phase shifts δ₀, δ₁, δ₂, δ₃, δ₄ with values 90°, 67°, 55°, 30°, and 13° respectively. And we're told to ignore the rest, so I guess higher-order phase shifts beyond δ₄ aren't considered here.

I remember that in scattering theory, the scattering amplitude f(θ) is related to the phase shifts. The general formula for f(θ) is a sum over all the angular momentum states. Wait, the formula is something like f(θ) = (1/k) * sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) e^{2iδ_l} sin(δ_l) P_l(cosθ), where k is the wave number, and P_l are the Legendre polynomials. But wait, no, I think I might be mixing things up. Let me recall.

Oh right, the partial wave expansion of the scattering amplitude is f(θ) = (1/k) sum [ (2l+1) sin(δ_l) e^{2iδ_l} ] P_l(cosθ). But since the question is about the imaginary part along the incident direction, which is θ=0. Because when θ=0, the direction is along the incident beam.

Wait, yes, for θ=0, cosθ is 1, so P_l(1) is 1 for all l. Because the Legendre polynomial P_l(1) is 1 for any l. That makes things easier because each term in the sum becomes (2l+1) sin(δ_l) e^{2iδ_l} multiplied by 1. So the total f(0) is (1/k) sum [ (2l+1) sin(δ_l) e^{2iδ_l} ].

But the question is about the imaginary part of f(θ) along the incident direction, which is θ=0. So I need to compute Im[f(0)].

Wait, let's separate each term into real and imaginary parts. The exponential e^{2iδ} can be written as cos(2δ) + i sin(2δ). So each
