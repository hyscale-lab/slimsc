Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

Alright, the problem is about two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. The question gives me some information: Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. The astronomers found that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, and their radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s respectively. Hmm, but wait, the question is about their luminosities. The astronomers computed that Star_1's luminosity is greater than Star_2's by some factor, and I need to find which option it is.

So, the options are A through D, with numbers around 2.23 to 2.35. I think this is related to the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which relates a star's luminosity to its radius and temperature. The formula is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where L is luminosity, R is radius, σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and T is the effective temperature.

Wait, but the problem says that the stars radiate as black bodies. So, yeah, I can use that formula.

The problem says the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, that's the peak wavelength of their blackbody radiation. The peak wavelength λ_max is given by Wien's law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant (approximately 2.8977719×10^-3 m·K). So, if both stars have the same λ_max, that means their temperatures are the same. Because if λ_max is same, then T is same.

Wait, but wait—radial velocities? Oh, right, radial velocity is the speed at which the stars are moving towards or away from us. But the question says radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2 respectively. Hmm, how does this affect the observed wavelengths? Oh, right, this is about the Doppler effect. Because if a star is moving towards us, its light is blueshifted, and if moving away, it's redshifted.

But wait, the problem said that the wavelengths at which
