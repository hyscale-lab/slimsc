Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

So, the problem is about a star whose surface has dark spots, and how that affects the ratio of neutral Titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels. Hmm. The question gives details about the star's radius, mass, and temperature, both when it's spot-free and when 40% of its surface is covered by spots. 

When the star's surface isn't covered by spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Wait, why does that happen? Oh, right! Spots are cooler regions on the star's surface. So when the spots cover part of the surface, they make the overall effective temperature lower because they're emitting less radiation. 

The problem is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels, level 1 and level 2. They observe that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. And the question is, by what factor does this ratio change when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does? So, the ratio without spots divided by the ratio with spots, I think.

Since the photosphere is in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), I can use the Boltzmann equation for this. The Boltzmann equation relates the number of particles in two energy levels to the temperature and the energy difference between the levels. The formula is:

n2 / n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1) / (k*T) )

Where:
- n is the number of atoms in each level,
- g is the statistical weight (degeneracy) factor,
- E is the energy of each level,
- k is Boltzmann's constant,
- T is the temperature.

Wait, but the problem says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when the star has spots, the effective temperature is lower. Let me think about how that affects the ratio.

The energy difference E2 - E1 is related to the wavelength of the transition. The given wavelength is approximately 1448 Å, which is in the near ultraviolet or maybe the visible spectrum? Let me calculate the energy difference.

Energy E = hc / λ. H is Planck's constant, c is speed of light.

But since we're dealing with ratios, maybe I don't need the exact value, but just the relation with temperature.

Wait, the ratio of the number of atoms in two levels is given by the Boltzmann factor. So, when temperature changes, the ratio changes. Let's denote the ratio as R = n2/n1.

So, when the star has no spots, Teff is 6000 K, and the ratio is R1 = (g2/g1) exp( - ΔE / (k*T1) ), where T1 is 6000 K.

When the star has spots, the effective temperature is T2 = 5500 K. The ratio becomes R2 = (g2/g1) exp( - ΔE / (k*T2) ).

Wait,
