Okay, so I've got this question about optical isomerism in organic compounds. Hmm, optical isomerism is when a compound has chiral centers, right? Chiral centers are atoms, usually carbon, bonded to four different groups. These can cause the molecule to be non-superimposable on its mirror image, leading to enantiomers and thus optical activity.

The question lists four compounds, and I need to figure out which show optical isomerism. The options are A, B, C, D, each including different numbers.

Let me go through each one by one.

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Biphenyls can have stereoisomerism if there's a possibility of the substituents leading to different spatial arrangements. Wait, but in biphenyls, the substituents are on each ring. For there to be optical isomerism, there must be a chiral center. But wait, the biphenyl structure itself is symmetric if both substituents are in symmetrical positions. Oh, but this one has two nitro groups on the 6 and 6' positions. Let me sketch that. The biphenyl has two phenyl rings connected at position 1 and 1'. The substituents are on the 2 and 2' positions, and on the 6 and 6' positions. Wait, the substituents are two nitro groups on each 6 and 6', and the two carboxylate groups on 2 and 2'. So the structure is symmetric? Or maybe not. Wait, each ring has 2 and 6 substituents. The biphenyl could have a plane of symmetry, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, each substituent is in a position that might create a chiral center.

Wait, the carboxylate groups are esters, so the structure is OMe-O-C-O-CO-... Hmm, no, maybe that's not the main point. The main consideration is whether there are chiral centers.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry. Let me think: if the molecule is symmetric, then it can't have optical isomerism. But if the substituents are arranged asymmetrically, maybe the molecule can have a chiral center.

Wait, but biphenyl structures can sometimes exhibit diastereomerism if the substituents are in different positions. But for optical isomerism, the molecule needs to have a chiral center. If the molecule itself has a plane of symmetry, it won't be chiral.

Wait, considering the substituents: each phenyl ring has two substituents. The 2 and 6 positions are meta to each other on each ring, right? Because in a benzene ring, positions 1, 2, 3, etc., so 2 and 6 are across from each other (opposite each other). So each ring has a nitro group at 6 and a carboxylate ester at 2. So each ring has substituents at 2 and 6, which are across from each other. So the molecule is symmetrical because each ring is the same. Thus, the molecule as a whole might have a plane of symmetry, making it not chiral, so no optical isomerism. Wait, but maybe the biphenyl linkage itself creates chirality. Oh, wait, the biphenyl has a single bond between the two rings, so it's a flexible structure. But for a molecule to have optical activity, it must be chiral, i.e., no plane of symmetry and at least one chiral center.

Wait, maybe the central bond allows rotation, but in some cases, if the substituents on each ring are arranged in a way that makes the entire molecule chiral. But in this case, each ring has substituents in symmetric positions, so the entire molecule might be achiral, right? Because it can be a mirror image of itself. So maybe compound 1 doesn't show optical isomerism.

Hmm, I'm a bit unsure. Let me move on and check the others.

2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. The structure is CH3
