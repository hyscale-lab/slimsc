Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). The question is asking for the energy of the RHIC so that the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96c. Hmm, nucleus X is defined as Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, lithium has an atomic number of 3, so Li-6 maybe? Because Li typically has 3 protons, and 3 neutrons would make it Li-6. So the mass number A is 6.

Right, so the nucleus is moving at 0.96 times the speed of light. I remember that when dealing with relativistic speeds, the energy isn't just (1/2)mv² because that's non-relativistic. Oh right, the total energy in relativity is gamma times the rest mass energy.

So the formula for relativistic energy is E = gamma * m_0 * c². But wait, what's gamma? Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

Given v = 0.96c, let's compute gamma. Let me think: v² is (0.96c)^2, so v²/c² is 0.9216. Then 1 - v²/c² is 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of that is sqrt(0.0784) which is 0.28. So gamma is 1 / 0.28. Let me calculate that. 1 divided by 0.28 is approximately 3.5714. Wait, but let me get it more accurately. 0.28 squared is 0.0784, so 1/0.28 is 10/2.8 which is about 3.5714. Hmm, precise calculation would be better. Let me compute sqrt(0.0784) exactly. 0.0784 is 784/10000, which is (28^2)/(100^2), so sqrt(784/10000) is 28/100 = 0.28. So yes, gamma is 1/(0.28) = 3.57142857... approximately 3.5714.

So gamma is
