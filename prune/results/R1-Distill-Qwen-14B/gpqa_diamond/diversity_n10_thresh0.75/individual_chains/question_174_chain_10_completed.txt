Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about nuclear fission and kinetic energy. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The problem says that an atomic nucleus of mass M is initially at rest, and its rest-mass energy is 300 GeV. Then it undergoes spontaneous fission, splitting into two fragments. One fragment is twice as massive as the other. The sum of their rest masses is 99% of M. So, M is the initial mass, and the total rest mass after fission is 0.99*M.

Wait, but wait, when a nucleus undergoes fission, it's usually accompanied by the release of energy because some mass is converted into energy (E=mc²). But here, the sum of the rest masses is 99% of M. So, the total rest mass after fission is less than before. That means energy was released, which makes sense.

The question is about the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment, T1. We need to find the difference between the correct relativistic T1 and the classical (non-relativistic) approximation T1.

Let me outline what I know.

First, let's denote the two fragments. Let me call their masses m1 and m2. The problem says that one is twice as massive as the other. So, m1 = 2 * m2. Also, m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M.

Wait, if m1 is twice m2, then m1 = 2m2. So m1 + m2 = 3m2 = 0.99*M. Therefore, m2 = (0.99*M)/3 = 0.33 M. Then m1 is 0.66 M. Wait, but 0.33*3 is 0.99, yes. So m1 is (0.66) M and m2 is (0.33) M.

But wait, is the initial mass M including the binding energy? Or is the initial mass just the rest mass? The problem says the initial rest mass energy is 300 GeV, so I think the initial mass M is the rest mass. So when it splits, the sum of the rest masses is 0.99M, implying that some energy is released.

But in any case, the important point is that the two fragments have rest masses of 0.66 M and 0.33 M. Since the initial nucleus was at rest, the total momentum after fission must be zero because momentum is conserved. So the momenta of the two fragments must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.

Let’s denote the velocities as v1 and v2. Using relativistic momentum, but wait, since the problem asks about the difference between the correct relativistic T1 and the classical approximation, perhaps I need to compute both and find the difference.

Wait, no. The correct approach is to compute T1 correctly, and then compute the classical approximation T1, and find the difference between the two.

So first, let's think about the correct relativistic calculation.

Since the system is at rest initially, the total momentum must be zero. So the relativistic momentum of each fragment must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.

Relativistic momentum p is gamma * m * v. So, p1 = gamma1 * m1 * v1, p2 = gamma2 * m2 * v2. And since p1 = -p2, their magnitudes are equal.

But because the problem involves two fragments, perhaps it's better to write the conservation of energy and conservation of momentum.

Let me write down all that I know:

1. Total initial energy: E_initial = Mc² (since it's at rest, all energy is rest mass energy). Wait, but E_initial is given as 300 GeV. Because the rest-mass energy is given as 300 GeV. Yes.

Wait, the initial nucleus has rest-mass energy of 300 GeV. So E_initial = 300 GeV.

After fission, the total rest mass is 0.99 M, which is 0.99 * M. But wait, M is the initial mass, so M = (300 GeV)/c². Because E=Mc², so M = E/c². So M is (300 GeV)/c².

Hmm, but perhaps I can work in units where c=1 for simplicity. So energy is measured in GeV, mass in GeV/c², but if I take c=1, then mass is in GeV/(c²), but when multiplied by c², it's GeV. So perhaps let me set c=1. So M = 300 GeV.

The sum of the rest masses after fission is 0.99 M, which is 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV.

So the rest mass energies are m1 c² = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV, and m2 c² = 0.33 * 300 = 99 GeV.

Wait, no. Because m1 + m2 = 0.99 M. Wait, no, wait: sum of the rest masses is 0.99 M. So, if M is 300 GeV/c², then m1 + m2 = 0.99 * 300 GeV/c² = 297 GeV/c².

So m1 = 0.66 * 300 GeV/c²? No, wait, m1 = 2 m2. So m1 + m2 = 0.99 M.

Let me compute m1 and m2 correctly.

m1 = 2 m2.

So m1 + m2 = 3 m2 = 0.99 M.

So m2 = (0.99 M) / 3 = 0.33 M.

Therefore, m1 = 0.66 M.

So m1 = 0.66 * 300 GeV/c² = 198 GeV/c².

m2 = 0.33 * 300 GeV/c² = 99 GeV/c².

But wait, the initial energy is 300 GeV. The rest mass after is 297 GeV. So the energy difference is 3 GeV, which must be the kinetic energy plus any binding energy, but the problem ignores electrons, so perhaps all the missing energy is the kinetic energy of the two fragments.

Wait, nuclear fission releases energy, so the sum of the rest masses is less than the initial, so the system must have some kinetic energy.

Conservation of energy: total energy after = initial energy.

So,

E_initial = E_final.

E_initial = Mc² = 300 GeV.

E_final = (m1 c² + K1) + (m2 c² + K2).

Because each fragment has rest mass energy and kinetic energy.

So,

300 GeV = (198 GeV + K1) + (99 GeV + K2).

So,

300 = 198 + 99 + K1 + K2.

300 = 297 + K1 + K2.

So,

K1 + K2 = 3 GeV.

Also, conservation of momentum: initial momentum is zero, so the total momentum after is zero.

So,

p1 + p2 = 0.

p1 = gamma1 m1 v1,

p2 = gamma2 m2 v2.

But since they are moving in opposite directions,

gamma1 m1 v1 = gamma2 m2 v2.

Hmm. But perhaps I can write it in terms of their momenta.

Alternatively, since the momentum vectors are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction, let's say p1 = +p, p2 = -p. The magnitudes are |p1|=p, |p2|=p.

So,

p1 = gamma1 m1 v1 = p,

p2 = gamma2 m2 v2 = p.

Wait, but since they're moving in opposite directions, perhaps their velocities are in opposite directions. So, if I take v1 positive, then v2 is negative, but the magnitudes are |v1| and |v2|.

But perhaps it's easier to think in terms of their speeds and masses.

But this is getting complicated. Maybe I can use the relation between their velocities and the momentum.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that the kinetic energy in terms of momentum is given by K = (p² c²)/(2 m) for non-relativistic speeds, but relativistic would be more complicated.

But since the problem asks about the difference between the correct T1 and the classical approximation, perhaps I can compute T1 both ways and subtract.

So, first, let's find the velocities and momenta using relativistic mechanics, and compute K1 correctly.

Then, compute the non-relativistic approximation for K1, and take the difference.

Hmm.

Let me proceed step by step.

Let me denote the speeds of the two fragments as v1 and v2.

From conservation of momentum,

gamma1 m1 v1 = gamma2 m2 v2.

But wait, because the momentum vectors are opposite, so perhaps the equation is gamma1 m1 v1 = gamma2 m2 v2, but considering direction, maybe I should set gamma1 m1 v1 = gamma2 m2 (-v2). Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps better to write the magnitudes as equal, so gamma1 m1 v1 = gamma2 m2 v2, but in opposite directions.

So,

gamma1 m1 v1 = gamma2 m2 v2.

Since m1 = 2 m2,

gamma1 (2 m2) v1 = gamma2 m2 v2.

Divide both sides by m2:

2 gamma1 v1 = gamma2 v2.

But I don't know the velocities yet.

Additionally, from energy conservation,

K1 + K2 = 3 GeV.

Where K1 is the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment, which is m1.

K1 = (gamma1 - 1) m1 c²,

K2 = (gamma2 - 1) m2 c².

So,

(gamma1 - 1) m1 c² + (gamma2 - 1) m2 c² = 3 GeV.

But m1 = 2 m2, so,

(gamma1 - 1)(2 m2 c²) + (gamma2 - 1)(m2 c²) = 3 GeV.

But m2 c² is 99 GeV,

So,

(gamma1 -1) * 198 GeV + (gamma2 -1) * 99 GeV =3 GeV.

Let me write this as:

198 (gamma1 -1) + 99 (gamma2 -1 ) =3.

Divide both sides by 99:

2 (gamma1 -1) + (gamma2 -1) ) = 3/99 = 1/33.

So,

2 gamma1 + gamma2 = 2 + 1 + 1/33 = 3 + 1/33 = 100/33.

Hmm, so equation (1): 2 gamma1 + gamma2 = 100/33.

Equation (2): 2 gamma1 v1 = gamma2 v2.

But we also have from momentum, which, in terms of speed, since momentum is gamma m v.

Wait, perhaps we can write v2 in terms of v1. But we need another equation.

Alternatively, perhaps we can write v2 in terms of v1 using the fact that the system's velocity must satisfy certain conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express gamma2 in terms of gamma1.

Let me think. Let me denote beta1 = v1/c, beta2 = v2/c.

So, v1 = c beta1, v2 = c beta2.

Then, equation from momentum:

gamma1 m1 v1 = gamma2 m2 v2.

Substituting m1 = 2 m2,

gamma1 (2 m2) (c beta1) = gamma2 m2 (c beta2).

Simplify,

2 gamma1 m2 c beta1 = gamma2 m2 c beta2.

Cancel m2 and c,

2 gamma1 beta1 = gamma2 beta2.

But m2 is (99 GeV/c²), but perhaps we don't need that.

So,

gamma2 = (2 gamma1 beta1 ) / beta2.

Another approach: perhaps use the relationship between the velocities.

But this could get complicated. Maybe it's better to use the velocity addition.

Alternatively, perhaps assuming that the two fragments move in opposite directions with speeds v and u, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps think in terms of the center of momentum frame, but not sure.

Hmm, perhaps I can write another equation in terms of gamma1 and gamma2.

Let me see.

We have equation (1): 2 gamma1 + gamma2 = 100/33.

Equation (2): 2 gamma1 beta1 = gamma2 beta2.

But beta1 = v1/c, beta2 = v2/c.

But I also know that in terms of gamma and beta, gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - beta²).

So,

gamma1 = 1/ sqrt(1 - beta1²),

gamma2 = 1/ sqrt(1 - beta2²).

But this seems complicated because it's non-linear.

Alternatively, perhaps we can assume that the velocities are non-relativistic, and see what that gives, then compute the actual relativistic case, and find the difference.

But wait, the question is about the difference between correct T1 and the non-relativistic T1. So perhaps I can compute T1 relativistically and then find what it would be classically, then subtract.

So, let's first compute the non-relativistic case.

In the classical (non-relativistic) approximation, kinetic energy is (1/2) m v².

But in that case, the momentum equation is m1 v1 = m2 v2. Because in non-relativistic, momentum is m v.

So, m1 v1 = m2 v2.

Since m1 = 2 m2,

2 m2 v1 = m2 v2.

So,

2 v1 = v2.

So, v2 = 2 v1.

Now, energy conservation in non-relativistic case:

K1 + K2 = 3 GeV.

K1 = (1/2) m1 v1²,

K2 = (1/2) m2 v2².

Substituting,

(1/2)(2 m2) v1² + (1/2) m2 (2 v1)^2 = 3 GeV.

Simplify,

(1/2)(2 m2 v1²) + (1/2)(m2 *4 v1²) = 3.

Which is,

m2 v1² + 2 m2 v1² = 3.

So,

3 m2 v1² = 3 GeV.

So,

m2 v1² = 1 GeV.

But m2 = 99 GeV/c².

Wait, wait, no. Let me recheck.

Wait, in the non-relativistic case, the kinetic energy is (p²)/(2m), where p is momentum.

But in our case, perhaps it's better to write the velocities in terms of each other.

Wait, from the momentum equation, m1 v1 = m2 v2.

v2 = (m1/m2) v1 = 2 v1.

So, v2 = 2 v1.

So, substituting into the energy equation,

K1 + K2 = (1/2 m1 v1²) + (1/2 m2 v2²) = 3 GeV.

So,

(1/2)*(2 m2)*v1² + (1/2)*m2*( (2 v1) )² =3 GeV.

Compute each term:

(1/2)(2 m2) v1² = m2 v1²,

(1/2) m2 (4 v1²) )= 2 m2 v1².

So,

m2 v1² + 2 m2 v1² = 3 m2 v1² =3 GeV.

So,

m2 v1² = 1 GeV.

We know m2 is 99 GeV/c².

Wait, but I'm working in units where c=1, so m is in GeV/c². So when I multiply by v², which is (dimensionless, if c=1), then the units would be GeV/c² * (dimensionless) = GeV/c². Hmm, but kinetic energy is in GeV. So perhaps I'm missing a factor of c².

Wait, maybe I should not set c=1. Let's reconsider.

Because in the non-relativistic case, KE is (1/2) m v², but m is in kg, v in m/s. So, in terms of energy, units would be kg m²/s².

But in particle physics, we often use units where c=1 and ħ=1, so energy in GeV, mass in GeV/c², etc.

Wait, perhaps I should be more precise.

The rest mass energy of m2 is m2 c² = 99 GeV.

So, m2 = 99 GeV / c².

Then, KE in non-relativistic case is (1/2) m2 v².

So,

(1/2) m2 v² = (1/2) (99 GeV/c²) v².

But the unit for KE is GeV, so we can write:

(1/2) m2 v² = (99 GeV/c²) * (v²) * (c²) ) / (2 c²).

Wait, that's getting a bit messy. Maybe better to write in terms of v in terms of c.

Let me set beta = v/c.

Then, v = beta c.

So, KE in non-relativistic case is (1/2) m2 (beta c)^2.

Which is,

(1/2) m2 beta² c².

But m2 c² = 99 GeV,

So,

(1/2) (99 GeV) beta².

So,

(1/2) *99 GeV * beta².

But in the non-relativistic case, the kinetic energy equation is:

K1 + K2 = (1/2 m1 v1²) + (1/2 m2 v2²) =3 GeV.

But in terms of beta,

K1 = (1/2) m1 v1² = (1/2) (2 m2) v1² = m2 v1².

But v1 = beta1 c, so v1² = beta1² c².

So,

K1 = m2 (beta1² c²)/1.

But since m2 c² = 99 GeV,

K1 = (99 GeV) * beta1².

Similarly, K2 = (1/2) m2 v2² = (1/2) m2 (v2)^2.

But v2 = 2 v1, since from the momentum equation v2 = 2 v1.

Wait, no. Wait, in non-relativistic case, m1 v1 = m2 v2.

Since m1 = 2 m2,

2 m2 v1 = m2 v2 → v2 = 2 v1.

So,

v2 = 2 v1 → v2² =4 v1².

So,

K2 = (1/2) m2 (4 v1^2) = 2 m2 v1^2.

Substituting m2 c² =99 GeV,

K2 = 2 * (99 GeV) (v1^2 / c²).

Wait, but v1 is in terms of c. Let me set beta1 = v1/c.

So,

v1^2 = beta1^2 c^2,

so,

K2 = 2 * (99 GeV) * (beta1^2 c^2) / c^2 ) = 2 *99 GeV beta1^2.

So,

K1 =99 GeV beta1^2,

K2= 198 GeV beta1^2.

Wait, but K1 + K2 = 3 GeV.

So,

99 GeV beta1^2 + 198 GeV beta1^2 = 3 GeV.

So,

297 GeV beta1^2 =3 GeV.

Divide both sides by 297 GeV,

beta1^2 =3 /297 = 1/99 → beta1 = 1/sqrt(99) ≈ 0.1005.

So, beta1 ≈ 0.1005 c.

So, v1 ≈ 0.1 c.

Thus, K1 =99 GeV * (1/99) )=1 GeV.

So, in the non-relativistic case, T1 (kinetic energy of the more massive fragment) is 1 GeV.

But wait, that's only 1 GeV? Because the total K is 3 GeV, and the more massive fragment has twice the mass, so perhaps it has more KE? Wait no, wait in non-relativistic, if m1 is larger, but their velocities are related by v2=2v1.

Wait, no. Wait, in the non-relativistic case, the more massive fragment (m1) has a smaller velocity, but since KE is (1/2)mv², and m is larger but v is smaller, maybe it's not straightforward.

Wait, but according to the calculation, K1 is 1 GeV, K2 is 2 GeV. Because 3 GeV total.

Wait, let me redo the non-relativistic calculation correctly.

Wait, wait, K1 is (1/2) m1 v1²,

K2 is (1/2) m2 v2².

But since m1=2 m2, and v2=2 v1,

So,

K1 = (1/2)(2 m2) (v1²) = m2 v1².

K2 = (1/2) m2 ( (2 v1)^2 ) = (1/2) m2 *4 v1² = 2 m2 v1².

So,

K1 + K2 = m2 v1² + 2 m2 v1² = 3 m2 v1² =3 GeV.

So,

m2 v1² = 1 GeV.

But m2 c² =99 GeV,

So,

m2 =99 GeV /c².

So,

(m2) v1² =1 GeV → (99 GeV/c²) v1² =1 GeV → v1²= (1 GeV c²) / (99 GeV) ) = c² /99.

So,

v1 = c / sqrt(99) ≈ 0.1005 c.

So,

K1 = m2 v1² = (99 GeV/c²) * (c²/99) )= 1 GeV.

So, K1 =1 GeV,

K2=2 GeV.

So, in the non-relativistic case, T1 is 1 GeV.

Now, the actual (relativistic) T1 would be higher, because in reality, when velocities are significant compared to c, relativistic effects come into play, so the kinetic energy is higher than the non-relativistic approximation.

So, we need to compute the correct T1 relativistically.

So, let's get back to the relativistic case.

We have:

Equation (1): 2 gamma1 + gamma2 = 100/33 ≈3.0303.

Equation (2): 2 gamma1 beta1 = gamma2 beta2.

We also have gamma2 in terms of gamma1 and beta1 and beta2.

But this seems complicated. Maybe we can find a substitution.

Let me express gamma2 from equation (1):

gamma2 = (100/33) - 2 gamma1.

Then, from equation (2):

2 gamma1 beta1 = [ (100/33) - 2 gamma1 ] * beta2.

Hmm, but I don't know beta2.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find another equation.

We know that from the relationship between gamma and beta: gamma =1/sqrt(1 - beta^2).

So,

gamma1^2 (1 - beta1^2) =1,

gamma2^2 (1 - beta2^2)=1.

But this seems getting too involved.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the velocities in terms of each other.

But perhaps I can find a relation between beta1 and beta2.

Wait, from equation (2), 2 gamma1 beta1 = gamma2 beta2.

But from equation (1), gamma2 = (100/33 - 2 gamma1).

So,

2 gamma1 beta1 = (100/33 - 2 gamma1) beta2.

Hmm, but without another equation, I'm stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps I can assume that the velocities are such that the kinetic energy is much less than the rest mass energy. Wait, but in this case, the kinetic energy is 3 GeV, which is small compared to 300 GeV. So perhaps approximating using non-relativistic is acceptable, but the question is about the difference between the correct and classical T1.

Wait, but in the non-relativistic case, T1 is 1 GeV, but in reality, since the fragments are moving at a significant fraction of c, the relativistic effects might make T1 larger.

Wait, but wait, in reality, the kinetic energy is 3 GeV in total. So, with the more massive fragment having a smaller velocity but higher mass, perhaps the KE would be a bit higher than the non-relativistic case.

Wait, but the non-relativistic approach gave K1=1 GeV, K2=2 GeV.

But the actual T1 could be higher.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to find the velocities, calculate the relativistic kinetic energy, then find T1.

But it's getting complicated. Maybe we can find the velocities.

Alternatively, perhaps we can use the invariant quantity in relativity.

The invariant mass squared is (E_total)^2 - (p_total c)^2 = (sum E)^2 - (sum p c)^2.

But since the nucleus is initially at rest, E_total is 300 GeV, and p_total is zero. So,

(300 GeV c)^2 = ( (E1 + E2)^2 ) - ( (p1 c + p2 c )^2 ).

But (p1 c + p2 c) = 0, since p1 = -p2.

So,

(300 GeV c)^2 = (E1 + E2)^2.

But E1 = m1 c^2 + K1,

E2 = m2 c^2 + K2.

So,

(300 GeV c)^2 = ( (m1 c² + m2 c² + K1 + K2 ) )^2.

But m1 + m2 =0.99 M → m1 c² + m2 c² =0.99 Mc² = 0.99 *300 GeV =297 GeV.

K1 + K2 =3 GeV.

So,

(300 c)^2 = (297 +3 )^2 c^2 → 300^2 = 300^2 → 90000=90000.

Which is an identity, so no new information.

Hmm, perhaps I need another approach.

Wait, another invariant is the rest mass of each fragment, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I can find the ratio of the velocities.

From equation (2): 2 gamma1 beta1 = gamma2 beta2.

But I can write beta2 as (gamma2 beta2 ) = (2 gamma1 beta1).

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write beta2 = (2 gamma1 beta1 )/(gamma2).

But from equation (1): gamma2 = 100/(33) - 2 gamma1.

So,

beta2 = [ 2 gamma1 beta1 ] / [ (100/33) - 2 gamma1 ].

But this seems not helpful.

Another approach: perhaps use the fact that in the center-of-momentum frame, both fragments have equal and opposite momenta. But that might not help directly.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the ratio of the kinetic energies.

But perhaps it's better to proceed numerically.

Let me try to make an assumption. Let me assume that the velocities are such that beta1 is small. But wait, in the non-relativistic case, beta1 is about 0.1, which is 10% of c. That's not that small, so relativistic effects may be noticeable.

Wait, for beta=0.1, gamma≈1.005, so non-relativistic approximation would be pretty close. So perhaps the difference between the correct and the classical T1 is small, which would explain the options given (like 2 MeV).

But let's proceed.

Let me denote gamma1 as x, gamma2 as y.

So,

Equation (1): 2x + y = 100/33 ≈3.0303.

Equation (2): 2x beta1 = y beta2.

We also have,

gamma1^2 (1 - beta1^2 ) =1 → beta1 = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma1^2).

Similarly,

beta2 = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma2^2).

But this is getting complicated.

Wait, perhaps I can express beta2 in terms of beta1 and the equation (2).

From equation (2):

y beta2 = 2x beta1.

So,

beta2 = (2x beta1)/y.

But from equation (1), y = (100/33) - 2x.

So,

beta2 = [2x beta1 ] / (100/33 - 2x ) .

Now, substitute beta1 and beta2 in terms of x and y.

But this is getting too tangled.

Alternative approach: perhaps we can relate the kinetic energies.

In the correct relativistic case, K1 = (gamma1 -1) m1 c²,

K2 = (gamma2 -1) m2 c².

We know that K1 + K2 =3 GeV.

But m1 c² =198 GeV,

m2 c²=99 GeV.

So,

K1 = (gamma1 -1) *198,

K2 = (gamma2 -1) *99.

So,

198 (gamma1-1) +99 (gamma2 -1 )=3.

Which simplifies to,

198 gamma1 -198 +99 gamma2 -99 =3 → 198 gamma1 +99 gamma2 =300.

But from equation (1), 2 gamma1 + gamma2 =100/33 ≈3.0303.

So,

gamma2 = (100/33 ) -2 gamma1.

Substituting into 198 gamma1 +99 gamma2 =300,

198 gamma1 +99 [ (100/33 ) -2 gamma1 ] =300.

Let me compute:

99*(100/33) = 3 *100 = 300,

99*(-2 gamma1 )= -198 gamma1.

So,

198 gamma1 +300 -198 gamma1 =300.

Which gives,

300=300.

So, this equation is redundant, and doesn't provide new information.

Hmm, so we need another equation.

But we have equation (2): 2 gamma1 beta1 = gamma2 beta2.

And expressions for beta1 and beta2 in terms of gamma1 and gamma2.

So,

beta1 = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma1^2)),

beta2 = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma2^2)).

So,

2 gamma1 * sqrt(1 - (1/gamma1^2)) = gamma2 * sqrt(1 - (1/gamma2^2)).

Hmm.

But since equation (1) relates gamma2 to gamma1, we can substitute.

gamma2 = (100/33) -2 gamma1.

So,

2 gamma1 * sqrt(1 - 1/gamma1^2 ) = [ (100/33) - 2 gamma1 ] * sqrt(1 - 1/( (100/33 - 2 gamma1 )^2 )).

This is a complicated equation, but perhaps I can make an approximation.

Wait, perhaps if the velocities are not too high, gamma1 and gamma2 won't be too big. Let me see.

In the non-relativistic case, gamma1 is approximately 1 + (v1^2)/(2c^2), but since v1 is about 0.1c, so (v1/c)^2 =0.01, so gamma1≈1.005.

But perhaps the actual gamma is a bit higher.

Let me make an initial guess.

Let me take gamma1 =1.01.

Then, gamma2=100/33 -2 *1.01 ≈3.0303 -2.02=1.0103.

So, gamma2≈1.0103.

Then,

beta1 = sqrt(1-1/(1.01)^2 ) ≈ sqrt(1 - 0.9801) = sqrt(0.0199)≈0.141.

Similarly, beta2 = sqrt(1-1/(1.0103)^2 )≈sqrt(1- ~0.980)=sqrt(0.02)≈0.141.

Then,

Check equation (2): 2 gamma1 beta1 = 2*1.01 *0.141 ≈0.285.

gamma2 beta2≈1.0103 *0.141 ≈0.142.

Hmm, 0.285 not equal to 0.142. So, this doesn't satisfy equation (2). So, my initial guess is incorrect.

Hmm, perhaps gamma1 is higher.

Let me try gamma1=1.03.

gamma2=3.0303 -2*1.03=3.0303−2.06≈0.9703.

But gamma can't be less than 1. So, this is impossible.

Hmm, that's not possible. So, perhaps gamma1 is less than 1.5.

Wait, let me think again.

Wait, equation (1): 2 gamma1 + gamma2 =3.0303.

If gamma2 must be greater than 1, then 2 gamma1 < 3.0303−1=2.0303.

So, gamma1 <1.01515.

So, gamma1 is around 1.01, as I tried earlier.

Wait, but in that case, let's proceed with gamma1=1.01 and gamma2=1.0103.

Equation (2): 2 gamma1 beta1 = gamma2 beta2.

We have beta1≈ sqrt(1-1/(1.01)^2 )≈sqrt(1−0.9801)=sqrt(0.0199)=≈0.141.

Beta2≈sqrt(1−1/(1.0103)^2 )≈sqrt(1−0.9805)=sqrt(0.0195)=≈0.1396.

So,

2 gamma1 beta1 ≈2*1.01 *0.141≈0.285.

gamma2 beta2≈1.0103 *0.1396≈0.141.

So,

0.285≈0.141 → Not equal. So, this doesn't hold.

Hmm, so perhaps a better approach is needed.

Let me try to set gamma1 as a variable, x, and express everything in terms of x.

So,

gamma2 = (100/33 ) - 2x ≈3.0303 -2x.

Then,

beta1 = sqrt(1 -1/x²),

beta2 = sqrt(1 -1/y²), where y=gamma2.

Equation (2):

2x beta1 = y beta2.

So,

2x * sqrt(1 -1/x²) = y * sqrt(1 -1/y²).

But y=3.0303−2x.

So,

2x sqrt( (x²−1)/x² ) = (3.0303−2x) sqrt( (y²−1)/y² ) .

Simplify:

2x * sqrt( (x²−1)/x² ) =2x * sqrt( (x²−1) ) /x =2 sqrt(x²−1).

Similarly,

(3.0303−2x) * sqrt( (y²−1)/y² )= (3.0303−2x) * sqrt( (y²−1) ) / y.

So,

2 sqrt(x²−1) = (3.0303−2x) * sqrt( y²−1 ) / y.

But y=3.0303−2x.

So,

2 sqrt(x²−1) = (3.0303−2x) * sqrt( ( (3.0303−2x)^2 −1 ) ) / (3.0303−2x).

Simplify denominator:

= (3.0303−2x) * sqrt( ( (3.0303−2x)^2 −1 ) ) / (3.0303−2x)

= sqrt( (3.0303−2x)^2 −1 )

So,

2 sqrt(x^2−1) = sqrt( (3.0303−2x)^2 −1 )

Square both sides:

4 (x²−1) = (3.0303−2x)^2 −1.

Expand right side:

(3.0303)^2 - 2*3.0303*2x + (2x)^2 −1.

Compute 3.0303^2: approximately 9.182.

2*3.0303*2x=12.1212 x.

So,

Right side: 9.182 -12.1212 x +4x² −1 =4x² -12.1212 x +8.182.

So,

Left side:4x²−4.

Equation:

4x²−4 =4x²−12.1212 x +8.182.

Subtracting 4x² from both sides:

−4 =−12.1212 x +8.182.

Bring variables to left:

12.1212 x = 8.182 +4 →12.1212 x=12.182.

So,

x=12.182 /12.1212≈1.005.

So, x≈1.005.

So, gamma1≈1.005,

gamma2=3.0303−2*1.005=3.0303−2.01=1.0203.

Now, let's compute beta1 and beta2.

beta1= sqrt(1 -1/(1.005)^2 )=sqrt(1−1/1.010025)=sqrt(1−0.9901)=sqrt(0.0099)=≈0.0995.

Similarly, beta2= sqrt(1−1/(1.0203)^2 )=sqrt(1−1/(1.04096))=sqrt(1−0.961)=sqrt(0.039)=≈0.1975.

Now, check equation (2):

2 gamma1 beta1 =2*1.005 *0.0995≈0.200.

gamma2 beta2=1.0203 *0.1975≈0.201.

Which is close enough, considering rounding errors.

So, the approximate values are:

gamma1≈1.005,

gamma2≈1.0203.

So, K1=(gamma1−1) * m1 c²= (0.005) *198 GeV=0.99 GeV≈1 GeV.

K2=(gamma2−1)*m2 c²=(0.0203) *99 GeV≈2 GeV.

Wait, but that's the same as the non-relativistic case, which can't be right because in reality, the kinetic energies should be a bit higher due to relativity.

Wait, but wait, in the non-relativistic case, K1 was 1 GeV, and here, K1 is approximately 0.99 GeV, which is actually lower. That doesn't make sense. So perhaps my approximation is off.

Hmm, maybe I need to compute more accurately.

Wait, in gamma1=1.005,

gamma1−1=0.005,

m1 c²=198 GeV,

so K1=0.005*198=0.99 GeV.

Similarly, gamma2=1.0203,

gamma2−1=0.0203,

m2 c²=99 GeV,

so K2=0.0203 *99≈2 GeV.

So, total K≈3 GeV, which matches.

But in the non-relativistic case, K1=1 GeV, K2=2 GeV.

In the relativistic case, K1≈0.99 GeV.

Wait, that's lower than the non-relativistic case. That can't be right, because the non-relativistic approximation should underestimate the kinetic energy for higher speeds.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, no, gamma is larger than 1, so (gamma-1) is positive. So, in the relativistic case, the KE is higher than in the non-relativistic case.

Wait, but in this case, K1=0.99 GeV, which is less than the non-relativistic case of 1 GeV.

Hmm, that seems contradictory. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, perhaps I should compute the velocities more accurately.

Wait, let's compute beta1 and beta2 more accurately.

With gamma1=1.005,

gamma1=1/sqrt(1−beta1²),

so,

1.005 =1/sqrt(1−beta1²),

so,

sqrt(1−beta1²)=1/1.005≈0.99502,

so,

1−beta1²=(0.99502)^2≈0.99009,

so,

beta1²=1−0.99009=0.00991,

so,

beta1≈0.09955 c.

Similarly, gamma2=1.0203,

sqrt(1−beta2²)=1/1.0203≈0.9800,

so,

1−beta2²≈0.9604,

beta2²=1−0.9604=0.0396,

beta2≈0.199 c.

Now,

p1 = gamma1 m1 v1.

m1=198 GeV/c²,

v1=0.09955 c.

So,

p1=1.005 * (198 GeV/c²) * (0.09955 c )=1.005 *198 *0.09955 GeV/c.

=1.005 *19.71 GeV/c ≈19.81 GeV/c.

Similarly, p2=gamma2 m2 v2.

m2=99 GeV/c²,

v2=0.199 c.

So,

p2=1.0203 *99 *0.199 GeV/c.

=1.0203 * 19.701 GeV/c ≈20.19 GeV/c.

But since the momentum vectors are opposite, p1=+19.81 GeV/c, p2=−20.19 GeV/c.

Wait, but in reality, they should have equal magnitudes. So, perhaps my approximation is slightly off. But given that gamma2 is slightly larger, perhaps the approximation is acceptable.

But back to the kinetic energy.

K1=(gamma1-1)*m1 c²=0.005 *198=0.99 GeV.

But in the non-relativistic case, K1=1 GeV. So, in reality, it's a bit lower. That can't be right because when you consider relativity, the KE should be higher for the same momentum.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the kinetic energy expression.

Wait, the correct relativistic KE is (gamma-1) m c^2. So, for a particle moving at higher speeds, the KE is higher, even if the acceleration is small.

But in this case, the non-relativistic calculation gives K1=1 GeV, and the relativistic gives K1=0.99 GeV.

Which is counterintuitive.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the approximation.

Wait, let me try a more accurate calculation.

Let me compute gamma1 and gamma2 more accurately.

Wait, earlier, I found gamma1≈1.005, gamma2≈1.0203.

But perhaps a more precise calculation is needed.

Let me re-express equation:

4 (x²−1) = (3.0303−2x)^2 −1.

Which expands to:

4x²−4 = 9.182 −12.1212 x +4x² −1.

Simplify:

4x²−4 =4x²−12.1212 x +8.182.

Subtract 4x² from both sides:

−4 = −12.1212 x +8.182.

Move terms:

−4−8.182 =−12.1212 x →−12.182=−12.1212 x → x=12.182/12.1212≈1.005.

So, x=1.005.

So, gamma1=1.005, gamma2=3.0303−2*1.005=1.0203.

So, the calculation seems correct.

But then, the KE of fragment 1 is 0.99 GeV, which is less than the non-relativistic case. That suggests that in reality, the KE is lower than the non-relativistic approximation. That can't be right.

Wait, perhaps because the more massive fragment's velocity is lower, and the relativistic effects increase KE less than expected.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the exact K1.

Wait, K1 = (gamma1-1)*198 GeV.

With gamma1=1.005, K1=0.005 *198=0.99 GeV.

But in the non-relativistic case, K1=1 GeV.

So, the difference is 0.99−1=−0.01 GeV=−10 MeV.

But the problem asks for the difference between the correct T1 and the classical T1.

So, |0.99−1|=0.01 GeV=10 MeV.

Wait, that would mean that the correct T1 is 10 MeV less than the classical approximation. But this contradicts what I thought earlier.

Wait, but no: the correct T1 is 0.99 GeV, the non-relativistic is 1 GeV. So the correct is less than the non-relativistic, meaning that the non-relativistic overestimates by 0.01 GeV=10 MeV.

But this can't be right because relativistic kinetic energy should be higher than non-relativistic for the same velocity.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me compute K1 and K2 using the correct relativistic KE.

K1 = (gamma1−1)*m1 c².

m1 c²=198 GeV.

gamma1=1.005 → gamma1−1=0.005.

So,

K1=0.005 *198=0.99 GeV.

Similarly,

gamma2=1.0203 → gamma2−1=0.0203.

m2 c²=99 GeV.

K2=0.0203 *99=2 GeV.

So K1=0.99 GeV, K2=2 GeV.

Total K=3 GeV.

In the non-relativistic case, K1=1 GeV, K2=2 GeV.

So, the correct K1 is 0.99 GeV, which is 0.01 GeV less than the non-relativistic value.

So, the difference is 10 MeV.

So, the correct T1 is 0.99 GeV, and the non-relativistic is 1 GeV.

So, the correct is less than the non-relativistic by 0.01 GeV=10 MeV.

But wait, this seems counterintuitive because when you account for relativity, particles moving at higher speeds should have higher KE than predicted by classical mechanics.

Wait, but perhaps because the more massive fragment is moving slower, the relativistic effect is less pronounced.

Wait, perhaps for a given momentum, the KE is higher when the mass is lower.

Wait, in this case, the more massive fragment (m1) has a lower velocity, so the effect of relativity is less significant compared to the lighter fragment, which has a higher velocity and thus more relativistic effects.

So, perhaps for m1, the relativistic KE is lower than what the non-relativistic approximation gives, because the non-relativistic overestimates the KE for lower speeds.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense. Because for low speeds, the non-relativistic approximation is good. So, maybe in this case, the non-relativistic approximation overestimates the KE because it's assuming higher speed than it really is.

Wait, in reality, the more massive fragment is moving slower, so the actual KE is less than the non-relativistic calculation, which assumes higher speed.

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps I should proceed with the calculation.

The difference between the correct T1 and the non-relativistic T1 is 0.99 GeV −1 GeV=−0.01 GeV=−10 MeV.

But the question asks for the difference between the correct T1 and the classical T1. So, the correct T1 is 0.99 GeV, the classical is 1 GeV.

The difference is 0.99−1=−0.01 GeV=−10 MeV.

But the options are positive, so perhaps the absolute value is 10 MeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 10 MeV.

So, the correct answer is C)10 MeV.

But wait, the problem says "the difference between the (correct) T1 value, and T1 value calculated using classical (non-relativistic) approximation."

So,

Difference = Correct T1 − Classical T1 =0.99 −1 =−0.01 GeV=−10 MeV.

But the options are positive, so maybe the question is about the absolute value.

So, the difference is 10 MeV.

But the options are:

A) 2 MeV.

B)5 MeV.

C)10 MeV.

D)20 MeV.

So, the answer is C)10 MeV.


To solve the problem, we analyze the fission process and compare the relativistic and non-relativistic kinetic energies of the more massive fragment. The initial nucleus of mass \( M \) (rest-mass energy \( 300 \, \text{GeV} \)) splits into two fragments with rest masses \( m_1 \) and \( m_2 \), where \( m_1 = 2m_2 \) and \( m_1 + m_2 = 0.99M \). This gives \( m_1 = 0.66M \) and \( m_2 = 0.33M \). The total rest-mass energy after fission is \( 297 \, \text{GeV} \), leaving \( 3 \, \text{GeV} \) of energy as the total kinetic energy of the two fragments.

### Non-Relativistic Case
In the non-relativistic approximation, the kinetic energy is given by \( K = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 \). Using conservation of momentum (\( m_1v_1 = m_2v_2 \)) and energy (\( K_1 + K_2 = 3 \, \text{GeV} \)), we find:
\[
K_1 = \frac{1}{2}m_1v_1^2 = 1 \, \text{GeV}, \quad K_2 = \frac{1}{2}m_2v_2^2 = 2 \, \text{GeV}.
\]
Thus, the non-relativistic kinetic energy of the more massive fragment is \( T_1^{\text{classical}} = 1 \, \text{GeV} \).

### Relativistic Case
In the relativistic case, the total energy of each fragment is \( E = \gamma m c^2 \), where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \). The kinetic energy is \( K = (\gamma - 1)mc^2 \). Using conservation of momentum and energy, we solve for the relativistic kinetic energy of the more massive fragment. After detailed calculations, the relativistic kinetic energy of the more massive fragment is found to be:
\[
T_1^{\text{relativistic}} = 0.99 \, \text{GeV}.
\]

### Difference Between Relativistic and Classical Values
The difference between the relativistic and classical kinetic energies of the more massive fragment is:
\[
\Delta T_1 = T_1^{\text{relativistic}} - T_1^{\text{classical}} = 0.99 \, \text{GeV} - 1 \, \text{GeV} = -0.01 \, \text{GeV} = -10 \, \text{MeV}.
\]
Taking the absolute value, the difference is \( 10 \, \text{MeV} \).

### Conclusion
The correct answer is **C) 10 MeV**.

Answer: C
