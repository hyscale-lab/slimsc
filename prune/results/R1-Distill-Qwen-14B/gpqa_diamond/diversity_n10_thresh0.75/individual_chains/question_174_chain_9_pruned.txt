Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about nuclear fission and kinetic energy. Hmm, let's try to unpack it step by step. 

Alright, the problem says that an atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest, and its rest-mass energy is 300 GeV. Then it undergoes spontaneous fission, splitting into two fragments. One fragment is twice as massive as the other in terms of their rest masses. The sum of their rest masses is 99% of the initial mass M. 

The question is about finding the difference between the correct kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (T1) and the value calculated using the classical (non-relativistic) approximation. The options are given in MeV, so I need to calculate that difference.

Wait, okay, let's jot down the given data:

- Initial rest mass energy: 300 GeV. So Mc² is 300 GeV, so M = 300 GeV / c². But since we're dealing with mass ratios, maybe I can work without actual units for mass.

- After fission, two fragments: let their rest masses be m1 and m2. One is twice the other. So let's say m2 = 2 m1. 

Wait, no. Wait, the problem says one fragment is 2 times more massive than the other. Hmm, so m1 = 2 m2? Or m2 = 2 m1? Let me think. It says "the more massive fragment" is one. So if the more massive is twice the other, then m1=2 m2. Or is it the other way around? Let me check the wording. The fragment that's more massive is T1's kinetic energy. So the more massive one would be the bigger mass. So if one is twice as massive as the other, m1 = 2 m2, where m1 is the more massive. So m1 = 2 m2.

But wait, the sum of rest masses is 99% of M. So m1 + m2 = 0.99 M. But since M is the initial mass, and the rest mass energy is 300 GeV, which is M c², but since we're working with masses, probably M is in units where c=1, so M is 300 GeV/c². But maybe that's getting too into
