Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it carefully again.

So the question is about a star that's similar in radius to the Sun. One hemisphere has dark spots covering 20% of that hemisphere. The star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are cooler by 1000K. Because the star is only spotty on one hemisphere, when it rotates, the brightness variations observed photometrically can look like an exoplanet transit. The question is asking what the radius of an exoplanet would have to be to produce the same brightness variation as these spots, assuming the star wasn't spotted.

Hmm, I remember that when a planet transits a star, the dip in brightness is proportional to the square of the planet's radius over the star's radius. The formula is (Rp/Rstar)^2. So I need to find Rpl/Rstar such that its squared equals the fractional drop in brightness caused by the spots.

Wait, but first, what's the fractional drop due to the spots? The filling factor is 20%, so the spots cover 0.2 of the hemisphere. But wait, a hemisphere is half the star's surface. So the total area covered by spots is 0.2 * (π Rstar² / 2) )? Or wait, no, the filling factor is the fraction of the projected surface. So when the star is viewed from Earth, the spots cover 20% of the visible hemisphere. So the total area of spots is 0.2 * (π Rstar² / 2). Because each hemisphere is half the star's surface.

But when the star rotates, the hemisphere facing us changes. But in this problem, the effect is that the spots are causing a variation similar to an exoplanet. So let's think about the maximum drop. When the spots are on the side facing us, the drop is due to the spots' lower brightness.

Each spot is cooler. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, so the spots are at 5000 K. The flux from the spots is lower. So the change in flux is the difference between the unspotted flux and the spotted flux.

The flux from a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: F = σ T^4. So the drop in flux per spot is (F_unspotted - F_spotted) per unit area.

But wait, the star is losing flux in the spotted area. So the total flux from the star when the spots are visible is F_total = F_unspotted * (1 - filling factor) + F_spotted * filling factor.

Wait, the filling factor is 0.2. So the fraction of the observed hemisphere that is spotted is 0.2. So the total flux is F = F_star * (1 - 0.2) + F_spot * 0.2.

F_star is the flux without any spots, which is σ T^4. F_spot is σ (T-1000)^4. So substituting:

F = σ T^4 (0.8) + σ (T-1000)^4 (0.2)

The change in flux compared to the unspotted star is ΔF = F - F_unspotted = σ T^4 (0.8 - 1) + σ (T-1000)^4 (0.2)

Which simplifies to ΔF = -0.2 σ T^4 + 0.2 σ (T-1000)^4.

So the fractional change in flux is ΔF / F_unspotted = [ -0.2 T^4 + 0.2 (T-1000)^4 ] / T^4

Factor out 0.2:

= 0.2 [ - T^4 + (T-1000)^4 ] / T^4

Let me compute the term (T-1000)^4 / T^4.

Wait T is 6000 K. So T-1000 = 5000 K.
