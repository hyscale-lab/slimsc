Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it carefully.

The problem is about a spherical conductor with a cavity. Hmm, so the setup is an uncharged spherical conductor of radius R, and inside it is a small spherical cavity. The cavity's center is a distance s away from the conductor's center, and s is less than R, since r (the cavity radius) is smaller than R. Then, a small positive charge +q is placed inside this cavity. The question is about finding the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor.

The point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor. Also, the distance from P to the cavity's center is l, and l and L are both greater than R. The angle between l and s is theta.

The options are A, B, C, D, each giving a different formula for E.

Alright, let me think about what I know regarding conductors and electric fields. I remember that when a conductor is neutral, charges can redistribute. But in this case, the conductor was uncharged before the charge +q was placed inside the cavity. So, what happens when a charge is inside a cavity of a conductor?

Oh right, when a charge is placed inside a conducting cavity, it induces charges on the inner and outer surfaces of the conductor. Wait, but in this case, the conductor is initially uncharged. So, the total charge on the conductor must remain zero. 

So, when +q is placed inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor will have an induced charge of -q, and the outer surface will have +q. Because the conductor was initially neutral, so the total induced charge has to sum to -q (inner) + q (outer) = 0, keeping the conductor neutral.

But wait, the conductor is a spherical shell. Oh wait, no, the conductor is a solid sphere with a cavity inside. So, the conductor is a solid sphere, but there's a cavity inside, so the conductor material is outside the cavity. So, the conductor has inner and outer surfaces in terms of the cavity.

Wait, no, the conductor is a solid sphere, so the cavity is a hollow inside. So, the conductor's material is the sphere between radius r (cavity) and R (the conductor's radius). When a charge +q is placed inside the cavity, it induces a charge on the inner surface of the conductor (the surface at radius r) of -q, because the conductor is a conductor, charges move freely. Then, since the conductor as a whole is neutral, the outer surface must have +q.

So, the conductor's outer surface has a charge of +q, distributed over the outer surface.

Now, for the electric field outside the conductor. I remember that the electric field outside a charged spherical conductor is as if all the charge were concentrated at the center. So, the field outside would be E = (1/(4πε₀)) * (Q_enclosed)/(r²), where r is the distance from the center.

In this case, the conductor's outer surface has +q, so the field outside (P is outside, since L > R) should be given by that formula, treating the +q as the enclosed charge. So, E should be (1/(4πε₀)) * q/(L²), because the distance from the center is L.

Wait, but let's think again. The point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor. The distance from P to the cavity's center is l, which is also greater than R. Oh, but the conductor's radius is R, so point P is outside the conductor, so the field there depends only on the total charge on the outer surface, which is +q. So, the field should be as if the charge is at the center, so the direction is along the line from the center to point P.

Wait, but the options have some terms with l, s, and cos(theta). So, perhaps I'm missing something here.

Wait, wait. The point P is outside the conductor, but the charge distribution inside the conductor might have some effect. Let me think again.

The conductor's
