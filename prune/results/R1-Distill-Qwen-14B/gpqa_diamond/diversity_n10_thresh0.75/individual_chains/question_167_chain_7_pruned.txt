Okay, so I've got this problem about calculating the non-Gaussianity of a Schrödinger cat state using relative entropy. Hmm, I remember non-Gaussianity measures how non-Gaussian a state is, right? And since cat states are highly non-Gaussian, this should be a positive value.

The state given is |psi> = [cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>]/N. Oh wait, alpha is the amplitude, phi is the phase, and N is the normalization constant. The normalization N is given as sqrt(1 + sin(2*phi)*exp(-2*alpha²)). 

The parameters given are phi = -pi/4 and alpha = 0.5. I need to compute the non-Gaussianity (nG) using the relative entropy measure. The formula is delta_b = trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau), where tau is the density matrix of a reference Gaussian state, and rho is the density matrix of the non-Gaussian state.

Wait, but how do I find tau? Oh right, for the relative entropy, the reference Gaussian state is typically the best Gaussian approximation to the given state. But wait, isn't the given state already a specific non-Gaussian state?

Alternatively, I think that for a cat state, the Gaussian state reference might be the coherent state, but I'm not entirely sure. Or maybe it's the closest Gaussian state, which could be the thermal state or another type. Hmm, this part is a bit tricky.

Wait, the problem states that tau is the density matrix of a reference Gaussian state. But how do I choose which Gaussian state to use as the reference? Since the problem asks to calculate the nG for the given state, I'm guessing that the reference Gaussian state is the one that is closest to the given state in some sense, perhaps the maximum likelihood Gaussian approximation.

But wait, for the cat state, which is a superposition of coherent states, the closest Gaussian state would be the Gaussian state that has the same first and second moments as the cat state. Coherent states are Gaussian, but when you have a superposition, the resulting state's moments differ.

Wait, maybe the reference Gaussian state is the maximum-entropy Gaussian state with the same first and second moments as the given state. Or perhaps it's the state that minimizes the relative entropy, which would be the best Gaussian approximation.

Alternatively, perhaps the reference Gaussian state is the coherent state with the same displacement as the average of the two coherent states in the superposition. Let me think.

The given state is a superposition of |alpha> and |-alpha>, with coefficients cos(phi) and sin(phi), respectively. So when phi=-pi/4, cos(phi) is sqrt(2)/2 ≈ 0.707, and sin(phi) is -sqrt(2)/2. So the state is (0.707|0.5> - 0.707|-0.5>)/N.

Wait, but what is N? Let's compute it first. N = sqrt(1 + sin(2*phi)*exp(-2alpha²)). Let's plug in phi = -pi/4 and alpha=0.5.

sin(2*(-pi/4)) = sin(-pi/2) = -1. exp(-2*(0.5)^2) = exp(-0.5) ≈ 0.6065. So N = sqrt(1 + (-1)(0.6065)) = sqrt(1 - 0.6065) = sqrt(0.3935) ≈ 0.627. So N is approximately 0.627.

So the state |psi> is (0.707|0.5> - 0.707|-0.5> ) / 0.627. 

But wait, what's the density matrix rho for this state? It's |psi><psi|. So rho is a pure state.

Now, the relative entropy is del_b = S(rho) - S(tau), where S is the von Neumann entropy. Since rho is pure, S(rho) = 0. Because for a pure state, rho ln
