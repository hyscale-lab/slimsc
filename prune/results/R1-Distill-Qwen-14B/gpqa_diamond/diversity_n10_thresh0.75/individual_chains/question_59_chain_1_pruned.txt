Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with pH calculations involving multiple acids and bases. But I'll try to think it through step by step.

The problem is about finding the pH of a solution made by mixing three different solutions: 500 mL of 0.1 M acetic acid (CH3COOH), 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, and 300 mL of 0.3 M barium hydroxide (Ba(OH)2). Hmm, that's a mix of an acid and a base. Oh wait, but wait, the first two are acids, and the third is a base. So I think I need to figure out the net acid or base situation here.

First, I remember that when you mix acids and bases, they can neutralize each other. So maybe I should calculate the moles of H+ from the acids and the moles of OH- from the base, then see if there's excess. If there's excess H+ or OH-, the solution will be acidic or basic, respectively. If they exactly neutralize, the solution would be neutral (pH 7), but that's probably not the case here.

Let me break it down.

First, calculate moles for each solution.

Starting with CH3COOH. It's a weak acid, so I'll need to consider its dissociation, but wait, the HCl is a strong acid. Oh wait, but wait, when mixing these, the strong acid might affect the weak acid's dissociation. Hmm, but maybe since HCl is a strong acid, it will completely dissociate, providing a lot of H+ ions which might suppress the dissociation of acetic acid. But since I'm going to calculate the total H+ and OH-, maybe the HCl and Ba(OH)2 will react first, determining if there's an excess of either.

Wait, but Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. Each Ba(OH)2 gives 2 OH- ions because the formula is Ba(OH)2. So each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives 2 moles of OH-.

Similarly, HCl is a strong acid, so it dissociates completely, giving 1 mole of H+ per mole of HCl.

CH3COOH is a weak acid, so it doesn't dissociate completely, but when mixed with strong acid, maybe the additional H+ will make it less dissociated. But wait, perhaps I can ignore the CH3COOH's contribution if the other reactions are dominant. Or maybe not. I'm a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step is to calculate the total moles of H+ from the acids and the total moles of OH- from the base, then see if they neutralize each other. Any excess will determine the pH.

So let's compute the moles.

For CH3COOH: Volume is 500 mL, which is 0.5 L. Molarity is 0.1 M, so moles = 0.5 L * 0.1 M = 0.05 moles. Since it's a weak acid, it contributes some H+ but not all. But since we have HCl as a strong acid, maybe the H+ from HCl will be much higher, so perhaps the acetic acid's contribution is negligible for the initial neutralization. But maybe I should consider it, or perhaps it's better to calculate all sources.

HCl: Volume is 400 mL = 0.4 L, molarity 0.2 M. Moles HCl = 0.4 * 0.2 = 0.08 moles. Since HCl is a strong acid, it dissociates completely, so 0.08 moles of H+.

Ba(OH)2: Volume is 300 mL = 0.3 L. Molarity 0.3 M. Moles Ba(OH)2 = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles. Each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives 2 moles of OH-, so total OH- is 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

Wait, but when you mix an acid and a base, they react: H+ + OH- → H2O.

So the total H+ available is from HCl and any H+ from CH3COOH. But CH3COOH is a weak acid, so it doesn't contribute as much. Alternatively, maybe the H+ from HCl is 0.08 moles, and the OH- is 0.18 moles. Let's compute the net OH- or H+.

Wait, wait. Let's see: H+ from HCl is 0.08. OH- from Ba(OH)2 is 0.18.

So when they react, H+ + OH- → H2O. So which is in excess?

The OH
