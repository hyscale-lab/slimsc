Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I remember that the radial velocity (RV) method detects planets by measuring the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravitational pull. The shift tells us about the planet's mass and its orbit.

The question says there are two stars with the same mass as the Sun. Each has a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. So both planets are probably in the same mass category, but the RV shifts are different. Planet #1 has a shift of 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2's shift is 7 milliangstroms.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the RV method measures the velocity of the star, right? The velocity semi-amplitude K is what's measured. So the Doppler shift relates to the star's velocity. The formula I remember is K = (v) where v is the velocity, and this is related to the planet's mass and the orbit.

The formula for the RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ (G * (M_p)^3 ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) * (1 - e^2) ) ) ]^(1/3) * (1 / (c * sin i))

Wait, no, maybe that's getting too complicated. Alternatively, I think another approach is needed. Since both stars have the same mass and the planets have similar masses, but the RV shifts are different, this must relate to their orbital periods or velocities.

Wait, no, the RV method gives us the velocity semi-amplitude K, which is the maximum speed of the star's reflex motion. The formula for K is:

K = ( (2π G) / (P c) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) * sqrt(1 - e^2) ) )

But since the planets are Neptune-like, e is probably small (circular orbits, so e=0). The inclination i is 90 degrees for both, I think, because otherwise we wouldn't detect the planet, or at least the minimum mass would be considered. So sin i is 1.

But both M_* are same, and M_p is same, so K would be proportional to ( (1/P) )^(1/3). Because the equation would be K ∝ [ (M_p) / (M_* )^(2/3) ) ] * (1/P)^(1/3 )

Wait, wait, rearranging the formula. Let me try to express K in terms of other variables. Let's think about the formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude. The formula is:

K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p) ) )^(1/3) * (1 / (2π c)) ) * ( (1 / sqrt(1 - e^2)) ) * (2π / P )^(1/3)

Wait, I'm getting a bit lost. Maybe I should think about the relation between K and the orbital period. Let's see, from the formula, K is proportional to (M_p / M_* )^(1/3) * (1 / P)^(1/3) * (1 / (1 - e²)^(1/2) )

But since e is zero (as the orbits are circular), and M_p and M_* are the same for both planets and stars, the only varying factor is 1/P^(1/3). So K ∝ 1/P^(1/3). Which means P ∝ 1/K^(3).

Wait, no. Let me think again. If K is proportional to (1/P)^(1/3), then P is proportional to (1/K)^(3). So if K increases, P decreases.

Wait, so the problem says that Planet #2 has a larger shift (7 milliangstroms) than Planet #1 (5). So K_2 is higher than K_1. Therefore, since K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), if K increases, P decreases.

But the question is asking how many times longer is Planet #2's orbital period compared to Planet #1. So P2 / P1 = ?

If K is proportional to (1/P)^(1/3), then K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So K1 / K2 = (P2 / P1)^(1/3). Because K1 = (1/P1)^(1/3) * C, K2 = (1/P2)^(1/3) * C, where C is a constant.

So K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3). So (P2/P1) = (K1/K2)^3.

Wait, no, let's do it step by step. Let's write:

K ∝ 1/P^(1/3) → K = C * P^(-1/3), where C is a proportionality constant.

So for planet 1: K1 = C * P1^(-1/3)

Planet 2: K2 = C * P2^(-1/3)

Divide the two equations:

K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

So (K1/K2) = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

We can solve for the ratio P2/P1.

Take both sides to the power of 3:

(K1/K2)^3 = (P2/P1)

So P2/P1 = (K1/K2)^3

But wait, K2 is larger than K1. So K1 is 5 and K2 is 7. So K1/K2 = 5/7 ≈ 0.714.

So (0.714)^3 ≈ 0.364.

So P2 is 0.364 times P1. So P2 is shorter than P1 by about
