Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to think it through. The question is about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, I remember that the RV method looks for shifts in the star's spectral lines caused by the planet's gravity making the star wobble. The bigger the planet and the closer it is to the star, the bigger the shift, right?

The problem says that two stars with the same mass (like our Sun) each have a planet similar to Neptune. Both planets have circular orbits. So, planet #1 causes a 5 milliangstrom shift, and planet #2 causes a 7 milliangstrom shift. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1.

Wait, the RV method detects the Doppler shift. The Doppler shift is related to the velocity of the star due to the planet. Oh right, the formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = ( (G * (M_p) * sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(0.5) ) ) )^(1/3) * ( (P) / (2π) )^(−1/3) )

Wait, maybe that's getting too complicated. Alternatively, I've heard that the RV semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_p * sin i) / (M_*^(2/3) * P^(1/3)) ), assuming M_p << M_*, which is true here since planets are much less massive than stars.

So, K ∝ (M_p) / (M_*^(2/3) * P^(1/3) )

But in this case, since both stars have the same mass (M_*) and the planets have similar masses (Neptune-like), M_p is roughly the same for both planets. So M_p is the same, M_* is same, so K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3).

Wait, let me think again. The RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( (G * P )^(1/3) * M_p * sin i ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) * (1 - e²)^(0.5
