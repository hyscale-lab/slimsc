Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out which compound E is. Let me try to unpack this step by step.

The problem describes a series of reactions starting from compound A and going through several steps to form E. There are also some hints provided, so I should pay attention to those.

First, let me break down the reaction steps:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to produce compound B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 and Pd to form compound C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 to form compound D.
4. Compound D loses an inert gas to form compound E.

And the hints:

a) A reacts with an unknown phosphorous ylide to form 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Hmm, I remember that ylides, especially those from phosphorous reagents like the Wittig reaction, are used to form alkenes. The product here is a substituted cyclopentane with a propenylidene group attached. So maybe A has a carbonyl group because the Wittig reaction typically converts carbonyls to alkenes.

b) The IR of A shows a strong peak around 1750 cm^-1, which is characteristic of a carbonyl group (C=O). E's IR is around 1715, which is also a carbonyl but maybe a ketone or an ester. Wait, 1750 is higher, which suggests maybe an ester or a ketone? Wait, no, ketones are around 1700-1750. Esters can be similar, but maybe E is a ketone with a different structure.

Let me think about each reaction step.

Step 1: A â†’ B via HCN. HCN adds to carbonyls, so A is likely a ketone or aldehyde. Since the product is B, which has HCN added, and the Wittig reaction hint suggests A has a carbonyl, so A is a ketone.

Reaction of ketone with HCN: HCN adds to ketones to form cyanohydrins. So B would be a cyanohydrin. Let me recall, when a ketone (like R2C=O) reacts with HCN, it forms R2C(OH)CN. So the -OH and -CN are added to the same carbon.

Step 2: B is reduced with H2 and Pd to form C. Pd with H2 is hydrogenation. So what is B? It's a cyanohydrin, which is R2C(OH)CN. Reduction of B would add hydrogen. The OH group would be reduced to -CH2NH2? Wait, no. Wait, when we have a cyanohydrin, the structure is R2C(OH)CN. Upon catalytic hydrogenation, the OH becomes an -O- group, and the CN group gets hydrogenated. Let me think. Wait, the hydrogenation would reduce the nitrile group (-CN) to an amine (-CH2NH2), but maybe under certain conditions it becomes an amine. Alternatively, perhaps the hydrogenation is partial? Or maybe it's a
