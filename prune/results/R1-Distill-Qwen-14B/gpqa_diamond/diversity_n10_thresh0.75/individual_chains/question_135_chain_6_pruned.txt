Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle decay. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, the question is about the possible decay products of a boson X. The given Lagrangian is L(y) = -λf ψf(y) (υ + X(y)) ψ̄_f(y). Oh wait, I think that might be a typo or something because the structure looks a bit off. Maybe it's supposed to represent an interaction term between the boson X and fermions. So the general form of such a term would be something like X ψ̄ ψ, which would come from a Yukawa coupling. 

The mass of the boson X is given as 6 GeV. So I'm supposed to find the allowed decay channels for X at the lowest order. The options are A, B, C, D, each listing different fermion-antifermion pairs.

Alright, so for boson decay into fermion pairs, the rule is that the mass of the boson must be at least twice the mass of the fermion. Because energy and momentum have to be conserved, right? So the fermions produced must each have a mass less than or equal to half of X's mass.

Wait, X has 6 GeV mass. So half of that is 3 GeV. So any fermion with mass less than or equal to 3 GeV can be a decay product.

Let me recall the masses of the known fermions. The up and down quarks are the lightest. Then the strange is heavier, then the charm, then bottom, top, and the leptons like electron, mu, tau, and neutrinos.

Wait, so for quarks: up and down are about a few MeV—much lighter than 3 GeV. Strange quark is around 100 MeV, which is still way under 3 GeV. Charm quark is about 1.5 GeV. So 1.5 * 2 is 3 GeV, so charm can be produced. Bottom quark is around 4.5 GeV, which is more than 3, so can't be produced.

Wait, X's mass is 6 GeV. So half is 3 GeV. So any fermion with mass less than or equal to 3 GeV can be a decay product. So possible fermions are:

Leptons: electron (0.511 MeV), muon (~105.7 MeV), tau (1.78 GeV). Tau is way under 3 GeV. So tau is allowed.

Quarks: up, down, strange, charm. So their anti-particles as well.

Wait, but let me think—since the quarks are confined, but in this interaction, the boson X is presumably mediating a force that can create quark-antiquark pairs. So the decay would be X → q q̄.

So the possible fermion pairs would include any quark pair where each quark's mass is less than or equal to 3 GeV. So up, down, strange, charm. But wait, charm is about 1.5 GeV, so 2*1.5 is 3 GeV. So allowed.

So the possible decay products would be any of the quark-antiquark pairs: uū, dđ, sī, cč̄, as well as the lepton pairs: e+ e-, μ+ μ-, τ+ τ-.

But wait, can X decay into b b̄? The bottom quark is about 4.5 GeV. 4.5 * 2 is 9 GeV, which is more than X's mass of 6 GeV. So that's not allowed. So b quark is out.

Similarly, top quark is way heavier, around 173 GeV, so that's way out of the question.

So possible decay products: u, d, s, c quarks and the leptons e, μ, τ.

Wait, but let me check the given options.
