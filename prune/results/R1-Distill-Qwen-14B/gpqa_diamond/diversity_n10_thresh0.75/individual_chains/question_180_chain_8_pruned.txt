Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. Let me try to make sense of it. Hmm, it's about electric potential energy in an isolated system of charges. Alright, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll think it through.

The problem says there are 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. Oh wait, 2e is twice the elementary charge, right? So each charge is 2 times 1.6 x 10^-19 coulombs. So that's 3.2 x 10^-19 C per particle.

12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. And the 13th charge is fixed at P. So point P is where the 13th charge is located, and the other 12 are each 2 meters away from P. Interesting setup.

The question is asking for the minimum energy of the system. Wait, energy. Oh, right, the electric potential energy of the system. Because in electrostatics, the potential energy is a measure of the work done to assemble the charges in that configuration.

So I remember that the electric potential energy (U) between two point charges is given by Coulomb's law formula: U = k * (q1 * q2) / r. Where k is Coulomb's constant, approximately 8.988 x 10^9 N·m²/C².

But since there are multiple charges, I need to consider the potential energy between each pair. Wait, but how? For a system of multiple charges, the total potential energy is the sum of the potential energies of each pair. So for each charge, you calculate the energy it contributes when brought near the others.

Wait, but in this case, the 13th charge is fixed at P, and the other 12 are each at 2 meters from P. So let me visualize this: point P has charge Q13, which is 2e. The other 12 charges, Q1 to Q12, are each located at a distance of 2 meters from P. So each of these 12 charges is 2 meters away from Q13.

But wait, so the potential energy between Q13 and each of the other 12 is going to be the same. So I can calculate the energy for one pair and then multiply by 12.

But also, between those
