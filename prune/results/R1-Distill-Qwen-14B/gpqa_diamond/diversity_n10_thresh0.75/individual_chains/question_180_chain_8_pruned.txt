Okay, I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but let me try to work through it step by step. So, the question is about an isolated system with 13 identical particles, each having a charge of 2e. The system is isolated, so I guess that means energy isn't being exchanged with the outside, but for the calculation, I think it's more about the potential energy between the charges.

Wait, the problem says 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. So, the setup is that there's a central charge (the 13th) at point P, and 12 charges each 2 meters away from P. I think these 12 are arranged in some way, like maybe forming a regular dodecahedron or something around P, but the exact arrangement might not matter for potential energy since we're dealing with each pair.

But wait, the question is about the minimum energy of the system. Hmm, potential energy in electrostatic systems is minimized when the charges are as close as possible, but in this case, the 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2m. So, maybe the minimum energy is already given by their fixed positions. So I don't have to worry about their movement; they're fixed at 2 meters from P.

So the system's total potential energy would be the sum of the potential energies between each pair of charges. Oh, right, because in a system of multiple charges, the potential energy is the work done to bring
