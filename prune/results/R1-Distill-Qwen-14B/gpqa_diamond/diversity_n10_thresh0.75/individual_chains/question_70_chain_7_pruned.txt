Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the molecular symmetry group of product E. Hmm, let's see. The question describes a series of reactions, and based on that, I need to deduce what E is and then determine its symmetry.

Alright, let me start by breaking down the reactions step by step. 

First reaction: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. I'm trying to think of what this could be. 8 equivalents sounds like a high molar ratio. Maybe something like sulfur reacting with something else, but wait, sulfur is bright red when it's in certain forms. Oh, wait! Maybe A is a metal and B is a halogen? Or perhaps A is an element that forms a compound upon reaction with B.

Wait, another thought: when you have a solid reacting with a gas in a high ratio, maybe it's something like the formation of a sulfide or oxide. But the product being bright red makes me think of something like mercury(II) nitrate is red, or perhaps a chromium compound? Or wait, maybe C is a transition metal complex.

Wait, another angle: C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids, F and G. F is strong, G is weak. So when C is hydrolyzed, it produces two acids. One strong, one weak. Strong acids are like HCl, H2SO4, HNO3. Weak are like CH3COOH, HCN, H3PO4. So perhaps C is a salt that, when it breaks down in water, produces these acids.

Wait, what salt would produce two different acids upon hydrolysis? Maybe something like a nitrate and another acid. Hmm. Wait, maybe C is a nitrate salt. For example, if C is Cu(NO3)2, when it reacts with water, it would hydrolyze? Wait, but nitrate salts usually don't hydrolyze that way. Or maybe C is a sulfite or similar.

Wait, another thought: if C is a sulfide, but then reacting with water might produce H2S, which is a weak acid, but what else? Or perhaps C is a nitride? No, nitrides usually react with water to produce NH3 and the corresponding base.

Wait, maybe C is a metal oxide. For example, if A is Na, and B is O2, then C could be Na
