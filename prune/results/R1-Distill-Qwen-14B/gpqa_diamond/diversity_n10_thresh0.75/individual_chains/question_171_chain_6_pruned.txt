Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. It's about electrophilic substitution reactions, specifically when certain substances react with excess bromine. The question is asking me to arrange six substances in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through step by step.

First, I remember that electrophilic substitution on aromatic rings can be influenced by directing groups. These groups can be either activating or deactivating, and they direct incoming electrophiles to certain positions—ortho, meta, or para.

Looking at each compound:

1) C6H5-CH3: That's toluene. The methyl group is an activating, ortho/para-directing group. So when bromine reacts, it should substitute more in the para position than the meta. But wait, I think para is the major product here because the methyl group is a strong activating group. So the para isomer would be a major product.

2) C6H5-COOC2H5: That's phenyl acetate. The carbonyl group (COOEt) is a deactivating group because it's an electron-withdrawing group. Wait, no, wait. Wait, acetate is an ester group, which is an ortho/para director? Or is it meta? No, wait, esters are deactivating because of the electron-withdrawing inductive effect, but they have an oxygen which can donate electrons through resonance. Hmm, this is confusing. Wait, esters are actually ortho/para directors because the lone pairs on the oxygen can help in resonance. Oh wait, wait, no: esters are meta directors because the carbonyl group is deactivating. No, wait, wait. Let me get this straight. The ester group is an electron-withdrawing group, which makes the ring less reactive, so it's a deactivating group. But since the oxygen is adjacent, it can donate electrons through resonance. Wait, I'm getting tangled here. Ester groups are usually meta directors, right? Or are they ortho/para? Oh, wait, no—wait, I think esters are actually meta directors because the carbonyl group is more dominant. Or maybe they are ortho/para? I'm a bit confused. Let me think—remember, the nitro group is a strong deactivating, meta-directing group. So ester is similar but maybe less so. Or is it an ortho/para director? Hmm, perhaps esters are ortho/para directors but deactivating. Wait, I think the ester group is an ortho/para director but deactivating. Because the ester has an oxygen which can donate electrons through resonance, but the carbonyl is electron-withdrawing. So the overall effect is deactivating but the directing is ortho/para. So in the case of substitution, the incoming electrophile would go to the ortho or para positions relative to the ester group.

Wait, but wait, I might be mixing up the effects. Alternatively, perhaps the ester is an ortho/para director. So for the substitution reaction, the Br would add para to the ester group.

3) C6H5-Cl: That's chlorobenzene
