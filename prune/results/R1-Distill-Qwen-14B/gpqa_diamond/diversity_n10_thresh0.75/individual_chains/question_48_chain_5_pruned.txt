Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again carefully. The question is about a series of reactions starting with cyclohexanone.

First, cyclohexanone is treated with bromine to form product 1. Then, product 1 is heated with sodium hydroxide to make product 2. Next, product 2 is treated with thionyl chloride and pyridine to get product 3. Finally, product 3 is treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (which I think is a strong reducing agent) to form product 4. The question is asking how many chemically distinct hydrogen atoms are on product 4.

Hmm, okay. Let me break down each step and determine the structures.

Starting with cyclohexanone. I know cyclohexanone is a cyclic ketone with a six-membered ring. The structure is a cyclohexane ring with a ketone group (O) attached.

Step 1: Treating cyclohexanone with bromine. Wait, when a ketone reacts with bromine, what happens? Oh, I remember that ketones can undergo a haloform reaction. In the presence of a base, maybe? Wait, but bromine alone might not be enough. Alternatively, maybe it's an addition reaction. But cyclohexanone is a cyclic ketone, so perhaps it's undergoing some sort of dihalogenation.

Wait, another thought: when a ketone reacts with bromine (Br2) in a solution, especially under certain conditions, it might lead to the formation of a dibromide. Alternatively, I think the keto group can be a site for nucleophilic attack, but I'm not sure. Wait, bromine is a dienophile, but that's in Diels-Alder reactions. Maybe that's not applicable here.

Wait, another angle: maybe the reaction is a bromination via addition of Br2. Wait, but cyclohexanone has a carbonyl group. The carbonyl can react with bromine, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact pathway. Alternatively, perhaps it's an example of the Hock rearrangement, but I don't think so. Alternatively, maybe it's a bromination at the alpha position.

Wait, perhaps it's the addition of bromine to the carbonyl group. So, when a ketone reacts with bromine, it
