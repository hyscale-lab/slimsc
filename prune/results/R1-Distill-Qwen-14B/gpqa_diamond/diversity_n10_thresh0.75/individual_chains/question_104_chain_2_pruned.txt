Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, right, the RV method detects planets by measuring the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum as the planet's gravity causes the star to wobble.

So, the setup is that there are two stars with the same mass as the Sun. Each has a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. The question is about the orbital periods of these planets relative to each other.

The RV method detects the star's movement towards and away from us. The shift in the spectral lines (wavelength) tells us about the star's velocity. The problem gives the shifts as 5 milliangstroms for planet #1 and 7 milliangstroms for planet #2.

Wait, so the Doppler shift is related to the velocity of the star. The bigger the shift, the higher the velocity. But how does that relate to the planet's orbital period?

I remember that the RV method measures the semi-amplitude of the star's velocity, K. So, K is the maximum velocity the star moves in either direction. The formula for K is given by something like K = ( (G * (M_planet) ) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) )) )^(1/3) * (something else). Wait, maybe it's better to think about the formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude.

Oh right, the formula for K is:

K = [ (G * M_planet^3 sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) * (1 - e^2)^(1/2) ) ) ]^(1/3) / (P^(1/3) )

But since the planets are detected, sin i is close to 1 (edge-on orbit, so maximum effect), and e is near 0 (circular orbit), so we can ignore those factors. Also, since M_planet is much less than M_star (Neptune is much less than Sun), M_star + M_planet â‰ˆ M_star. So the formula simplifies.

Wait, I think the simplified version for K is:

K = ( (21 * (M
