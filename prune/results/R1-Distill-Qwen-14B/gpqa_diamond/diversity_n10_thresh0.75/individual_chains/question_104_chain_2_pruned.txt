Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step. I remember that the radial velocity method detects planets by measuring the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum as the planet's gravity causes the star to wobble. The shift in the spectral lines tells us about the movement of the star towards and away from us.

The problem says that two stars have the same mass, similar to the Sun. Each has a planet with mass similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits, so their motion is uniform. They detected the planets using the RV method, and each showed a periodic shift in their spectral lines. 

Planet #1's shift is up to 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2's is 7 milliangstroms. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1.

Wait, so the Doppler shift depends on the velocity of the star towards or away from us. The formula that relates the velocity semi-amplitude K (the maximum velocity) to other parameters is something I should recall. I think it's K = (v) = (G * (M_p) * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) )^(1/3) ) * (1/( (P * (1 day))^(1/3) )) )

But since both planets have circular orbits, e is zero, so the denominator doesn't have that term. Also, the inclination i is 90 degrees for both because we're seeing the maximum shift (they say up to 5 and 7, implying maximum, so sin i is 1 for both). So K is proportional to (M_p) / (M_star)^(1/3) * (1/(P)^(1/3)) )

Wait, let me get this right. The radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ (G * M_p * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) ] * [ (1) / ( (P * (1 - e²)^(1/2) )^(1/3) ) ) ]

But since M_p is much smaller than M_star (like Neptune is much smaller than the Sun), M_star + M_p ≈ M_star, so we can approximate that term as M_star^(2/3). Also, since e=0, the equation simplifies.

So K ≈ (G * M_p) / (M_star^(2/3) * P^(1/3)) )^(1/1) ?

Wait, maybe I should look up the exact formula. Oh right, another version I remember is K = (v) = [ (2π G) / (c P) ]^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3)) )

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to write the relation between K and the orbital period. Let me think about the Doppler shift.

The Doppler shift is proportional to the velocity of the star. So K (the velocity amplitude) is proportional to (v of the star). The orbital velocity of the star is given by v = (2π a) / P, where a is the semi-major axis. But for a star in
