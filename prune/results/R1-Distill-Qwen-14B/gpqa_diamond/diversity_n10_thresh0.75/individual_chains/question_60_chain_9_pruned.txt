Okay, so I've got this question about space travel and time dilation. Hmm, let me think through it. Right, the question is about an astronaut traveling to Earth from the Large Magellanic Cloud. Oh wait, the Large Magellanic Cloud is a satellite galaxy of the Milky Way, right? So it's a pretty long distance away.

The spacecraft is moving at 0.99999987 times the speed of light. That's super close to the speed of light. I remember that when you go that fast, relativistic effects like time dilation come into play. So the astronaut's own experienced time will be less than the time observed from Earth, I think.

The astronaut is 22 years old, and their average lifetime is 150 solar years. So from Earth's frame of reference, the astronaut would live 150 years, but because of time dilation, the astronaut might age less during the trip.

Wait, but the question is about how long the trip takes from the astronaut's perspective. So I need to calculate the proper time experienced by the astronaut.

First, I should figure out the distance between the Large Magellanic Cloud and Earth. I'm not exactly sure, but I think the Large Magellanic Cloud is about 160,000 to 200,000 light-years away. Let's pick an approximate value for this problem. Maybe 163,000 light-years? I've heard that number before. So the distance is roughly 1.63e5 light-years.

The spacecraft's speed is 0.99999987c. Let me calculate the time from Earth's perspective first. Time = distance / speed. So distance is 1.63e5 light-years, speed is 0.99999987c. Since light travels one light-year in a year, the time would be 1.63e5 / 0.99999987 â‰ˆ 1.63e5 years. Because 0.99999987 is so close to 1, the time is almost the same as the distance in light-years. So about 163,000 years from Earth's frame.

But wait, the astronaut's lifetime is 150 years. If the trip takes 163,000 years from Earth's perspective
