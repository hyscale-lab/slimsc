Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The question involves Compound X, which has some IR and NMR data. It reacts with red phosphorus and HI, and I need to find the final product. The options are A to D, all some substituted benzoic acids or benzene derivatives.

First, let's look at the IR data. The peaks are at 3400–2500 cm-1, which usually indicates O-H or N-H stretches. But wait, 3400 could be an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. The 1720 cm-1 peak is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. That could be from an ester, ketone, or maybe a carboxylic acid. The 1610 and 1450 cm-1 might suggest aromatic C=C stretching. So maybe there's a benzene ring involved.

Now the NMR data. Starting with the 1H NMR:

10.5 ppm (bs, 1H). That's a broad singlet around 10 ppm. Which groups give that? Probably a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH). Carboxylic acids typically show a broad peak around 10-12 ppm. So maybe Compound X is a benzoic acid derivative.

Then 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H). These are typical aromatic protons. The doublets suggest a para-substituted benzene, like a substituent at the para position causing the two sets of doublets. So for example, something like para-substituted benzene with two substituents in the para positions. Wait, but if it's a benzene ring with two substituents in para positions, say, a substituent at position 4 and another at position 1. Hmm, actually, for a para-substituted benzene, you often get two doublets each integrating to 2H, which matches here. So maybe it's a mono-substituted benzene with substituents in the para positions—no, wait, that's not possible. Wait, perhaps it's a di-substituted benzene with substituents in the para positions. So for instance, two substituents on the benzene in para positions, each causing the adjacent protons to split into doublets. But wait, in para substitution, the two substituents would each have their own set of protons. Alternatively, if there's only one substituent, but that's a meta director, but the splitting would depend on the substituent.

Wait, the two doublets add up to 4H, so maybe it's a para-substituted benzene with substituents that de-shield the protons in such a way. Alternatively, maybe it's a disubstituted benzene where each substituent is in para positions to each other. For example, perhaps the benzene has two substituents—like two methyl groups in para positions, but wait, the substituents would affect the neighboring protons.

Wait, but looking at the other NMR signals: 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), 0.9 ppm (t, 3H).

The 0.9 ppm triplet (3H) is probably a terminal methyl group, like CH2CH2CH3. The 1.4 ppm doublet (3H) is maybe a CH2 group attached to something, perhaps a CH that's split into a doublet. The 1.7 ppm multiplet (2H) could be a CH2 next to a branching point. The 2.9 ppm multiplet (1H) could be a CH near some substituents.

Putting this together: perhaps there's a chain attached to the benzene ring, like a substituent that's an alkyl chain with a branch. Let's think of a substituent like CH2CH(CH2CH3)CH3 or something similar.

Wait, the substituent could be a sec-butyl group. Because sec-butyl would have a structure like CH2CH(CH2CH3)-. Let me see. But wait, if the substituent is a sec-butyl group attached to the benzene ring, how would that look in NMR?

Or perhaps it's a propyl group with some branching. Let me think about the NMR signals:

- The 0.9 ppm triplet (3H) suggests a -CH2CH2CH3 group. The triplet comes from the CH2 next to the CH2CH3, so that's the methyl end of an ethyl group.

- The 1.4 ppm doublet (3H) could be a methyl group attached to a CH. For example, if there's a structure like CH2-CH(CH3)-something. Alternatively, maybe it's a geminal di-substitution, but I'm not sure.

- The 1.7 ppm multiplet (2H) could be two protons on a CH2 that's adjacent to a branching point. Like if it's a CH2 next to a CH that's connected to another group.

- The 2.9 ppm (1H) multiplet could be a CH group that's part of a branch. For example, in a structure like CH(CH2CH2CH3)CH2-something.

Let me try to draw this. Maybe the substituent is a pentyl group? No, because the NMR doesn't have enough signals for that. Alternatively, maybe a propyl chain with a branching.

Wait, perhaps it's a substituent like -CH2CH(CH2CH3)- attached to the benzene. Let me structure it. Let's say the benzene has a substituent at the para position, which is a chain: CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-. So the benzene ring is attached to a CH2 group, which is attached to a CH, which has a CH2CH3 group as a branch. So the structure would be something like benzene-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-.

Wait, but that might not fit. Let me think about the NMR again. The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) could be the CH in the middle. The 1.7 (m, 2H) would be the CH2 next to the benzene. The 1.4 (d, 3H) would be the methyl group attached to the CH. The 0.9 (t, 3H) would be the end of the ethyl group.

Wait, so putting it together: the substituent is a -
