Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through. The question says that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over parallax to the fifth power. Hmm. I remember that parallax is related to distance. Let me recall, parallax (plx) is the reciprocal of distance. So plx = 1/d, where d is the distance. Oh wait, no, wait, actually, parallax is in arcseconds, and the distance in parsecs is d = 1/plx. So yeah, if plx increases, the distance increases because you're moving further away from the star.

The problem says the number of stars N varies with 1/plx^5. So N is proportional to 1/plx^5. But I need to find how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance r. Wait, so I think they're asking for the number density of stars as a function of distance. Like, if you look at a thin shell at distance r, how many stars are there per unit volume or per unit distance?

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the way the question is phrased: "how does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?" Oh, perhaps it's the number of stars per unit distance. So it's the differential number of stars with distance.

Let me write down the given relation: N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. But since plx is 1/d, substituting that in, N ∝ (d)^5. Because 1/(1/d)^5 is d^5. So N is proportional to d^5. But wait, that's the total number of stars as a function of distance. But wait, I think the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance. So perhaps it's the number per unit volume? Or per unit distance.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the number of stars in a thin shell between r and r+dr. So the number should depend on r and dr. So if N is proportional to 1/plx^5, and plx is 1/d, then N ∝ d^5. So if the number of stars in a shell at distance d is proportional to d^5, then per unit distance, how does it scale?

Wait, let's think about the number of stars as a function of distance. Let's say that the number of stars in a
