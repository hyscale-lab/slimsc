Okay, so I have this astronomy question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's take it slow because I'm still getting the hang of these concepts.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power, or 1/plx^5. And the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance, specifically per unit range of distance r.

Hmm. I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax (plx) is the apparent shift in the position of a star as observed from Earth due to our orbit around the sun. The formula I remember is that distance (d) in parsecs is approximately 1 divided by the parallax in arcseconds. So d ≈ 1/plx. But wait, the exact relationship I think is d = 1/plx, right? Because parallax plx is in arcseconds, and when plx is 1 arcsecond, the distance is 1 parsec.

But wait, the problem says the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So the number of stars N is proportional to 1/plx^5. So N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. But I need to relate this to distance because the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance.

Since distance d is 1/plx, I can express plx as 1/d. Let me write that down. Plx = 1/d, so plx^5 = (1/d)^5 = 1/(d^5). So substituting back into N, which is proportional to 1/plx^5, that becomes 1/(1/(d^5)) ) = d^5. So N is proportional to d^5.

Wait, wait. Let me double-check. If N ∝ 1/plx^5, and plx = 1/d, then substituting gives N ∝ 1/( (1/d)^5 ) = d^5. So N is proportional to d^5.

But the question asks how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance r. So I think they're asking about the change in number as a function of distance, perhaps the differential number per unit distance. Alternatively, maybe they're looking for the cumulative number up to a certain distance, but I'm not exactly sure.

Wait, the question says, "
