Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. It's about the Michael addition reactions, and I need to figure out the products for each of the three given reactions. Hmm, I remember that the Michael addition is a conjugate addition where a nucleophile attacks the beta position of an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. Let's break it down step by step.

Alright, the first reaction is between dimethyl malonate and methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate in the presence of NaOEt and EtOH. So, what's happening here? Dimethyl malonate is a good Michael donor because it's a dienolate. The acceptor here is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, which has an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl group. The reaction conditions are NaOEt, which is a strong base, so it deprotonates the malonate to form the enolate.

The enolate will attack the beta position of the acrylate. The structure of the acrylate is CH2-C-(p-tolyl) with a methyl ester on the other end. So when the enolate attacks, the alpha position (from the malonate) will add to the beta carbon of the acrylate. Let me visualize this.

So the starting materials are:

- Dimethyl malonate: O=C(CO2Me)2
- Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate: CH2=CH-(p-tolyl)-CO2Me (but wait, wait, no, I think it's more like CH2-C(=O)-OCH3 on one side and a CH2-p-tolyl group on the other? Or perhaps it's CH2-CH2 with the substituents. Wait, no, acrylate is CH2=CHCO2Me, but in this case, it's substituted. So methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH-CO2Me with a p-tolyl group at the beta position. Wait, no, perhaps the structure is CH2=CH-CO2Me but with a p-tolyl group on the CH2? Maybe it's CH2-p-tolyl connected via a double bond. Hmm, perhaps the structure is CH2=CH-p-tolyl-... Wait, maybe I should draw it. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is (E)-methyl 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, which would be CH2=CH-CO2Me, but the substituents are arranged so that the p-tolyl is on the same side as the ester? Or maybe it's CH2-C(p-tolyl)=CH2? No, wait, I think it's more like CH2=CH(C6H4-p-tolyl)CO2Me? No, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again.

The acrylate is E-configured, so the substituents on either end of the double bond are on opposite sides. The structure is CH2-CH(CO2Me
