Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about the Michael addition reaction. Hmm, I've studied a bit about this before, but I need to think through it carefully.

The question has three parts: reactions A, B, and C. I'll tackle them one by one.

Starting with reaction A: dimethyl malonate is reacting with methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate in the presence of NaOEt and EtOH. I remember that the Michael addition involves a nucleophile attacking the beta position of an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl. In this case, dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile, right? Because it's a dienolate. The other compound is an enone, so it's the Michael acceptor.

Dimethyl malonate has the structure CH2(CO2Me)2. The enolate would form at the alpha position (the middle carbon). So the nucleophile is the enolate of dimethyl malonate. The acceptor is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, which is something like CH2=CH-CO-OCH3 but with the substituents at E configuration. Wait, no, the structure is more like CH2-C(O)-OCH3 attached to a p-tolyl group. Wait, no, the structure is (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate: that would be CH2=C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3? Or maybe it's (E)-CH2-C(O)CH2-p-tolyl? No, wait, the substituents on the double bond are the acrylate group and a p-tolyl group. So, the acrylate is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but in the (E) configuration, the substituents on either side of the double bond would be the p-tolyl and the COOCH3. So the structure is CH2=C(p-tolyl)COOCH3, but in (E) configuration, meaning the groups are on opposite sides.

Wait, actually, (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have the structure CH2=C(p-tolyl)COOCH3. So the double bond is between carbons 2 and 3, with a p-tolyl group on carbon 2 and the COOCH3 on carbon 3. So the structure is CH2-C(=CH-p-tolyl)-COOCH3? No, wait, maybe it's CH2=CH-CO-OCH3 with the CH2 connected to p-tolyl? Hmm, not sure, but perhaps the structure isn't the most critical part right now.

In any case, the Michael addition would involve the nucleophilic enolate attacking the beta position (the carbon next to the carbonyl) of the acceptor. So the nucleophile (from dimethyl malonate) attacks the beta carbon of the acrylate. That would form a new carbon-carbon bond between the alpha (from malonate) and beta (from acceptor) carbons.

Considering the structures: dimethyl malonate is (CH2(COOCH3)2), and the enolate would be deprotonated at the central CH2, forming a conjugate base. Then this attacks the beta carbon of the acrylate.

So when the enolate of dimethyl malonate attacks the acrylate, the new bond forms, and the oxygen from the acrylate would then have a negative charge, but that would be quickly protonated or something.

Wait, but the product after the attack would be a tetrahedral intermediate. After the attack, the product would have the two carbons from the malonate (each with COOCH3 groups) attached to the acrylate's beta carbon.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think about the product structure. Let's say the nucleophile is from dimethyl malonate, which is CH2(COOCH3)2. When it attacks the beta
