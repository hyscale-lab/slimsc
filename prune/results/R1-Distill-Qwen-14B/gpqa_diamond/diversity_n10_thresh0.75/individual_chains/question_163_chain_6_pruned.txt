Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about dissolving Fe(OH)3 in a strong acid and finding the minimum volume needed, plus the pH of the resulting solution. Alright, let's break this down.

First, I remember that Fe(OH)3 is a sparingly soluble hydroxide. It's a weak base, I think. So when you add a strong acid to it, the acid will react with the hydroxide ions from Fe(OH)3. The reaction should produce Fe^3+ ions and water.

The problem says we have 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3. I'll need to find out how many moles that is. The molar mass of Fe(OH)3... Fe is about 55.85 g/mol, O is 16, and H is 1. So, Fe(OH)3 is 55.85 + (3*(16 +1 )) = 55.85 + 3*17 = 55.85 +51=106.85 g/mol. So moles = mass / molar mass = 0.1 g / 106.85 g/mol ≈ 0.000936 moles.

Wait, wait, wait. Let me double-check that calculation. 0.1 divided by 106.85. Hmm, 106.85 is approximately 107. So 0.1 / 107 ≈ 0.0009346 mol. Yeah, that's about right.

Now, when Fe(OH)3 dissolves in an acid, the reaction is Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+ → Fe^3+ + 3 H2O. So each mole of Fe(OH)3 requires 3 moles of H+ to dissolve. So for 0.000936 mol Fe(OH)3, we need 3 * 0.000936 = 0.002808 mol H+.

The acid provided is 0.1 M monobasic strong acid. Monobasic means it provides one H+ per molecule, like HCl. So the moles of H+ from the acid is 0.1 M * volume (in liters). Let's let volume be V liters. So 0.1 * V = 0.002808. Solving for V: V = 0.002808 / 0.1 = 0.02808 liters, which is 28.08 cm³. Wait, but looking at the options, option C is 28.05 cm³. Close enough, considering rounding. So the minimum volume is about 28.05 cm³. That would be the first part of the answer.

But wait, the problem mentions a total volume of 100 cm³. So the acid volume plus the solution volume? Or is that the final solution volume? Oh, wait. The way the question is phrased: "dissolve ... in 100 cm³ total volume." So the acid volume plus the Fe(OH)3 solution must add up to 100 cm³? Or is the 100 cm³ the final volume after adding the acid? Hmm, that's a bit confusing.

Wait, no, the problem says "dissolve ... in 100 cm3 total volume." So perhaps the total volume after dissolving is 100 cm³. So the acid volume would be less than 100 cm³ because we're adding it to the solution. But wait, when you add the acid, the volume changes. But maybe the problem simplifies by assuming the volumes are additive. So if the solution's total volume is 100 cm³, and the acid
