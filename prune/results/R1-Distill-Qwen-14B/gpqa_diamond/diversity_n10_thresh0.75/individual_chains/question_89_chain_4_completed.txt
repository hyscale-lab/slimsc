Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. It's a bit involved, but let me try to break it down step by step.

The question starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane being heated with excess KOH to give product 1. The NMR and IR data are provided. Then, product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. After that, ozonolysis is done on product 2 at low temperature, followed by adding dimethylsulfide to get product 3. The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3's NMR.

Hmm, let's start from the beginning. 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so it's quite rigid. Heating it with KOH... Oh, probably an elimination reaction, E2 maybe. But wait, with two bromine atoms, maybe it's a double elimination. Since KOH is a strong base, perhaps it deprotonates and the Br leaves. But where would the H come from?

Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane, so each Br is on adjacent carbons in the adamantane structure. When KOH is added, each Br could potentially be eliminated. Maybe each Br undergoes elimination, leading to the formation of a double bond. Oh wait, but in adamantane, the structure is such that each carbon is connected in a way that double bonds are possible in certain positions.

Alternatively, since adamantane is a polycyclic structure, perhaps dehydrohalogenation occurs, leading to the formation of an alkene. Wait, but if it's 1,3-dibromo, maybe each Br is on adjacent carbons, so elimination would form a double bond between those two carbons. So maybe product 1 is 1,3-adamantadiene or something similar.

Wait the NMR data for product 1: 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). And IR has a peak at 1720 cm^-1. The IR peak is around 1720, which suggests a carbonyl group, like a ketone or an ester. Wait, but the initial product is from an elimination reaction, which would form an alkene, not a carbonyl. Hmm, that's confusing. Maybe I'm wrong about the reaction.

Wait, another possibility: when two vicinal dihalides (like 1,3-dibromoadamantane) react with a strong base like KOH, perhaps they undergo a double elimination to form an epoxide? No, wait, epoxides form from dihalides via an SN2 mechanism with something like NaOH, but I'm not sure if that applies here. Wait, but the IR shows a carbonyl. Alternatively, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation to form a ketone? No, that doesn't fit.

Wait another thought: Maybe the reaction isn't elimination but something else. Could the KOH cause a substitution? But with two Br atoms, perhaps it's a double substitution, but I'm not sure how that would lead to a carbonyl.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the dihalide is treated with a strong base, leading to the formation of an oxide. Wait, but the IR peak is at 1720, which is more indicative of an ester or ketone. Alternatively, maybe the reaction forms an epoxide, but I think the carbonyl is more likely.

Wait, perhaps the product is not directly from the dihalide but a rearrangement. Hmm, another idea: Maybe the dihalide reacts to form a diketone via the Baeyer-Villiger oxidation, but I don't think KOH would do that. Alternatively, maybe it's a Dieckmann cyclization, but that's for esters.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the product's NMR. The 4.79 ppm (2H) might be a CH2 group next to an oxygen, like an ether or an ester. The 10H between 2.41-2.23 could be from the adamantane structure, perhaps as CH2 groups. The 1.94 (2H) might be another CH2 group.

Wait, but the IR peak at 1720 is a strong indication of a carbonyl. So perhaps the product is a ketone. How could that form from 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH?

Wait, wait a minute—maybe it's a double elimination followed by a keto-enol tautomerism. But that's a stretch. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation to form an alkyne, but that doesn't fit the IR.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a double elimination to form an alkene and then some reaction. But I'm not seeing it. Maybe I should think about the reaction conditions. KOH is a strong base and a good nucleophile. 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated, so probably an elimination reaction. But two eliminations would produce a diene, but that doesn't explain the carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the product is an epoxide. But then where's the carbonyl?

Wait, another angle: If the product has a carbonyl, maybe it's a ketone. How do we get a ketone from a dihalide? One possibility is elimination followed by some kind of oxidation. But KOH alone isn't an oxidizing agent. Unless it's some kind of elimination to form a carbonyl directly.

Wait, wait a second. Another reaction: When a dihalide is treated with a base, sometimes it can form a ketone via a process called the Fittig reaction, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a case of the Konovalov reaction or some other elimination.

Wait, perhaps the dihalide under basic conditions undergoes a double dehydrohalogenation to form a carbonyl. Wait, wait, but how? If the two Br atoms are on adjacent carbons, elimination would form a double bond, not a ketone.

Hmm, maybe I'm stuck here. Let me think about what the product 1 could be. The IR peak at 1720 is a strong carbonyl, so product 1 is likely a ketone. So what's a ketone that could come from 1,3-dibromoadamantane and KOH?

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation followed by a keto-enol tautomerism. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the dihalide undergoes a substitution to form a diol, but that wouldn't explain the carbonyl. Unless the diol is oxidized, but KOH isn't an oxidizing agent.

Wait, maybe the reaction isn't elimination but something else. Maybe the dihalide is treated with KOH to form a glycol, but that would require a vicinal dihalide. 1,3-dibromoadamantane is not vicinal, it's meta. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the dihalide is converted into a gem-diol, but that would require a dihalide on the same carbon, which is not the case here.

Wait, perhaps the product is a diketone. But how?

Alternatively, maybe the reaction isn't straightforward. Let me think about the structure of adamantane. Adamantane has a structure similar to a diamond, with four cyclohexane rings. 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have Br atoms on opposite sides. So when KOH is added, perhaps each Br is eliminated with adjacent H's, leading to two double bonds. But that would produce a diene, not a carbonyl.

Alternatively, perhaps the elimination leads to a bridgehead double bond, but again, that doesn't explain the carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the product is an epoxide. But then, the IR wouldn't show a carbonyl. So I'm still stuck.

Wait, maybe the product is a ketone formed via some kind of rearrangement. Let me think, maybe the dihalide undergoes a Hofmann elimination, but that would form an amine, not a carbonyl.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a case of the Gilmann reaction, but I don't think that applies here.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about the possible structures given the NMR.

In product 1, the NMR shows:

- 4.79 ppm (2H, maybe a CH2 group adjacent to an electronegative atom like O)
- 2.41-2.23 ppm (10H, perhaps CH2 groups in the adamantane structure)
- 1.94 ppm (2H, maybe another CH2)

The IR peak at 1720 cm−1 suggests a carbonyl, so maybe the structure is a ketone. So product 1 is a ketone derivative of adamantane.

Wait, perhaps the dihalide is converted into a ketone via a double elimination followed by some kind of ring contraction. Alternatively, perhaps it's a case where each Br is replaced by an oxygen group, but that's unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps each Br in the dihalide is replaced by an OH group, but then the IR wouldn't have a strong carbonyl. So that can't be right.

Wait, another thought: Maybe KOH is acting as a base, and the dihalide is undergoing two elimination reactions to form a carbonyl group. But I'm not sure about the mechanism here.

Alternatively, maybe the dihalide isn't reacting via elimination but via substitution. But with two Br atoms, perhaps it's a double substitution, but that would give a diol, not a ketone.

Wait, perhaps the product is an epoxide, but again, that doesn't align with the IR data.

Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think about the reaction conditions again. 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with excess KOH. So KOH is in excess, maybe acting as a base for elimination.

Wait, another possibility: The dihalide might undergo a coupling reaction, but with KOH, that's unlikely. Alternatively, maybe it's a Friedel-Crafts type reaction, but that's for aromatic compounds, and adamantane isn't aromatic.

Alternatively, perhaps the dihalide is subjected to a Hofmann-Löffler reaction, but that's for forming azides and I don't think it applies here.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the product structure. If product 1 has a carbonyl, then maybe it's an adamantanone. Adamantanone is a known compound where one of the bridgehead carbons is a ketone.

But how would that form from 1,3-dibromoadamantane and KOH?

Wait, perhaps each Br is eliminated, and the adjacent C-H bonds break, leading to the formation of a carbonyl group. But I'm not sure about the mechanism.

Wait, maybe the dihalide is converted into a diketone. But that would require two carbonyl groups, which doesn't fit the NMR data, which shows a singlet for 2H at 4.79 ppm. Hmm, maybe that's a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl.

Wait, another thought: The product could be a gem-dialkoxy compound. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the product is a ketone with adjacent CH2 groups. The NMR at 4.79 (2H) could be a CH2-O group, perhaps an ether. But that doesn't fit with the carbonyl in IR.

Wait, maybe the 4.79 ppm is a methylene (CH2) adjacent to an oxygen, like an ester or an ether. But then the carbonyl would be elsewhere.

Wait, maybe the product is an epoxide, but then the IR wouldn't have a strong peak at 1720.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a ketone with an adjacent CH2 group. So the structure could be something like (CH2)2CO, but in the context of adamantane.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is 1,3-diketone adamantane. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a double elimination to form a conjugated diene, but that doesn't explain the IR peak.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the next step. Product 1 is treated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. Then, product 2 undergoes ozonolysis to give product 3.

Ozonolysis typically cleaves double bonds into carbonyl groups. So if product 2 has a double bond, ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl-containing fragments.

Wait, so product 2 must have a double bond. So product 1 must have something that, upon treatment with aluminum isopropoxide, forms a double bond.

Wait, what does aluminum isopropoxide do? It's a Lewis acid catalyst, often used in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. But if product 1 is a ketone, maybe product 2 is formed via some kind of alkylation.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an alcohol, and aluminum isopropoxide helps in forming an ether. But I'm not sure.

Wait, but product 1 has a carbonyl group, so perhaps product 2 is an enol ether or something similar.

Wait, but product 1's NMR shows a peak at 4.79 ppm for 2H, which could be a CH2 adjacent to an oxygen. Maybe product 1 is an ether. Wait, but the IR has a carbonyl. Hmm, but ethers don't have carbonyls. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe product 1 is an ester. Esters have carbonyl groups. Then, IR at 1720 would fit. So, perhaps product 1 is an ester.

How could that form from 1,3-dibromoadamantane and KOH?

Wait, perhaps via a nucleophilic substitution. But with two Br atoms, perhaps each Br is replaced by an O-K+ group, making a di-ester? No, because KOH would provide hydroxide, not an ester group.

Alternatively, maybe the dihalide is converted into a ketone via some mechanism, but I'm not seeing it.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the dihalide is treated with KOH, leading to the formation of a diol, but that wouldn't explain the carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the dihalide is undergoing a coupling reaction, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is an example of the Corey-Fuchs reaction, which forms ketones from dihalides, but I'm not familiar with the specifics.

Hmm, perhaps I should just proceed with the assumption that product 1 is a ketone. Let's say product 1 is an adamantane-based ketone.

Then, product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide. What reaction could that be? Since product 2 is then ozonolysed, which reacts with double bonds, perhaps product 2 has a double bond.

Wait, when a ketone is treated with a Lewis acid like aluminum isopropoxide, it might undergo some kind of enolization or conjugate addition. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Friedel-Crafts alkylation, but ketones aren't usually activated for that.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is an alcohol, and product 2 is an ether, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about ozonolysis. Ozonolysis of a diene would form two carbonyl groups. But product 3's NMR is the focus, particularly the most deshielded hydrogen.

So, in product 2, there must be a double bond, probably in a position that, when ozonolysed, creates two carbonyl groups. Then, product 3 would have carbonyl groups and the corresponding hydrogen atoms adjacent to them.

In the NMR of product 3, the most deshielded hydrogen (ignoring those that exchange) would likely be those adjacent to carbonyl groups, like CH2=O or similar.

Wait, but in ozonolysis, the cleavage of the double bond would form carbonyl groups. So, considering that, the product 3 would have carbonyl groups where the double bond was.

So, the question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen. So, the most deshielded would be next to the carbonyl.

In product 3, each carbonyl would have adjacent CH2 groups. If the ozonolysis was done on a symmetrical double bond, product 3 would have two identical carbonyl-containing groups.

But let me think about how the ozonolysis would proceed. Ozonolysis of a double bond usually cleaves it into two carbonyl groups. So, for example, if the double bond was in a six-membered ring, the cleavage could produce two aldehydes or ketones, depending on substituents.

But if the double bond was in a bridge structure, perhaps each end of the cleavage would have different substituents.

Wait, but the exact structure of product 2 isn't clear, so perhaps I should think about the coupling pattern in product 3.

The most deshielded hydrogen would be adjacent to a carbonyl group. So, perhaps it's a CH2 group next to a carbonyl.

The coupling pattern depends on the neighboring hydrogens. For example, in a CH2 group next to a carbonyl, each proton would couple with the two protons on the same CH2 (geminal coupling, which is usually not observed in 1H NMR because they are equivalent) and with neighboring groups.

Wait, but more importantly, the coupling would be with adjacent (vicinal) protons. So, if the carbonyl is part of a CH2-C=O group, and the adjacent carbon has another group with protons, the coupling pattern would depend on that.

Alternatively, if the structure is something like CH2-C=O connected to another CH2, then each proton on the CH2 next to the carbonyl would couple with the protons on the adjacent CH2. Let's say each CH2 has two protons; then each proton on the first CH2 would couple with two protons on the adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet.

Wait, but wait. If the structure is CH2-C=O-CH2-X, where X is another group, then the CH2 next to the carbonyl (let's call it CH2-A) would have each H coupling with the two H on CH2-B (the adjacent group). So each H on CH2-A would have two neighboring Hs, leading to a triplet. But wait, if the coupling is only with two equivalent Hs, then it's a triplet. However, if there are more than two Hs, the splitting becomes more complex.

Wait, but if the adjacent group is a CH2, which has two Hs, then each H on CH2-A would split into a triplet. Because each H on CH2-A is next to two Hs on CH2-B, so n+1 = 3, so triplet.

But if the adjacent group is a CH with two Hs, it's the same.

Alternatively, if the adjacent group is a CH2 connected to another CH2, then each H on CH2-A would couple with the two Hs on CH2-B, and each of those Hs might also couple with another set, leading to more splitting.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let's think of a specific example. Suppose the structure after ozonolysis is a diketone, say (CH2)2CO. No, that's not right. Alternatively, perhaps it's something like CH2(C=O)CH2CH2... Hmm, not sure.

Wait, but the most deshielded hydrogen would be on a CH2 adjacent to a carbonyl. Let's say that each of those Hs is adjacent to two other Hs on the same CH2 (which are equivalent and don't split the peak) and maybe another set on an adjacent CH2 group.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that each H is adjacent to two Hs on one side and one on the other, leading to a triplet of triplets or something else.

Wait, perhaps product 3 has a structure where a CH2 group is next to a carbonyl and adjacent to another CH2 group. So the Hs on CH2-A (next to the carbonyl) would each couple with the two Hs on CH2-B. That would give a triplet.

But wait, let's think about the actual splitting. Each H on CH2-A is coupled with two Hs on CH2-B. So each H on CH2-A would split into a triplet (n=2, so n+1=3). So the peak for CH2-A would be a triplet.

But wait, if the coupling constants are similar, maybe it's a triplet. Or perhaps there are other couplings as well. Suppose CH2-A is next to another CH2 group, which is next to another CH2 group. Then each H on CH2-A would have coupling with two Hs on each adjacent CH2 group, leading to more splitting.

Wait, but I'm not sure about the exact structure. Let me think about the possible options.

The options are:

A) triplet

B) triplet of triplets

C) doublet of triplets

D) pentet

In the product 3, the most deshielded Hs are likely on a CH2 next to a carbonyl. If this CH2 is adjacent to another CH2 group (like CH2-CH2-C=O), then each H on the first CH2 would couple with two Hs on the adjacent CH2. So each H would be a triplet.

But wait, if the adjacent CH2 is itself a triplet, what about the splitting? Or maybe the adjacent group has more Hs.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that each H on the CH2 next to the carbonyl is coupled with two Hs on one side and two on the other, leading to a more complex splitting.

Wait, another possibility: The CH2 next to the carbonyl is connected to a CH2, which is connected to another CH2. So the coupling could be with two on each side, leading to a doublet of triplets or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the CH2 is between two CH2 groups on either side. So each H on CH2-A is next to two Hs on CH2-B and two Hs on CH2-C. If all couplings are similar, this could lead to a triplet of triplets, which would be option B.

But wait, when a proton is coupled with two different sets of protons, it can lead to a splitting pattern that's a combination. For example, if a proton is coupled with two protons (n=2) on one side and two on the other (n=2 again), the splitting would be (n+1)(m+1) = 3 * 3 = 9 peaks, but that's a nonet. But that's not one of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the coupling constants are different. If a proton is coupled with two protons (n=2) from one neighbor and another two (n=2) from another neighbor, it would have a triplet of triplets, which would result in 3 x 3 = 9 peaks, but that's a more complex pattern. But looking at the options, option B is triplet of triplets.

Wait, but maybe the adjacent groups are such that the coupling is only with two protons in total. For example, if the CH2 next to the carbonyl is between a CH2 and a CH group. Then, the coupling could be with two Hs on one side and one on the other, leading to (2+1)*(1+1) = 3 * 2 = 6 peaks, which would be a triplet of doublets, but that's not an option. Alternatively, perhaps it's a triplet of doublets, but the options don't include that.

Alternatively, perhaps the CH2 next to the carbonyl is adjacent to a CH group, which has two Hs. So each H on the CH2 would couple with two Hs on the adjacent CH. That would be a triplet. So option A is possible.

But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again.

In ozonolysis, the double bond is cleaved. So if product 2 has a structure like CH2-CH2 in the double bond, ozonolysis would cleave it into two carbonyl groups. So, perhaps product 3 has two carbonyl groups, each adjacent to a CH2 group.

So the structure might be something like (CH2)CO. So each CH2 would be next to a carbonyl. So the Hs on the CH2 would be adjacent to the carbonyl and perhaps another CH2 group.

Wait, but in that case, each CH2 would be next to two Hs on the adjacent CH2. So each H would split into a triplet.

Alternatively, if each CH2 is next to another CH2 group, which is next to another group, the splitting could be more complex.

But I'm not entirely confident. Let me try to think of an example.

Suppose product 2 is an alkene, say, something like CH2-CH2 in the structure. Ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyls, like O=CH-CH2-O=CH, but that doesn't make much sense. Alternatively, perhaps it's a bridge structure.

Wait, perhaps product 2 is a bicyclic compound with a double bond. Ozonolysis would open the bridge, forming two carbonyl groups. For example, if product 2 is bicyclo structure with a double bond, ozonolysis would cleave it, creating two ketones.

In that case, product 3 would have two carbonyl groups, each adjacent to CH2 groups.

So the Hs on the CH2 next to the carbonyl would each be coupled with the two Hs on the adjacent CH2. So each would be a triplet.

But wait, if each of those CH2 groups is also adjacent to another CH2 group, then the coupling could be more complex.

Alternatively, perhaps each CH2 next to the carbonyl is only adjacent to one other CH2, so each H would be a triplet.

So looking at the options, the most likely coupling pattern would be a triplet, which is option A.

But another thought: If the CH2 group next to the carbonyl is adjacent to another CH2 group which is then adjacent to another CH2 group, the coupling could involve two sets of two Hs, leading to a triplet of triplets.

But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the coupling is only with two Hs, leading to a triplet.

Given all this confusion, perhaps the correct answer is a triplet, option A.


The problem involves a multi-step reaction sequence starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Here's the analysis:

1. **Reaction with KOH**: Heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with excess KOH likely results in a double elimination reaction, forming a product with a carbonyl group. The IR spectrum showing a strong absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹ confirms the presence of a carbonyl group, suggesting that product 1 is a ketone derivative of adamantane.

2. **Reaction with aluminum isopropoxide**: Product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide, a Lewis acid. This step likely facilitates a reaction that introduces a double bond into the structure, forming product 2. This double bond is critical for the subsequent ozonolysis step.

3. **Ozonolysis and work-up**: Ozonolysis of product 2 cleaves the double bond, forming two carbonyl-containing fragments in product 3. The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is adjacent to a carbonyl group.

4. **Coupling pattern analysis**: The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is on a CH₂ group next to a carbonyl. This CH₂ group is adjacent to another CH₂ group, and each hydrogen on the CH₂ group couples with the two hydrogens on the adjacent CH₂ group. This results in a triplet coupling pattern due to the splitting caused by the two equivalent hydrogens on the neighboring CH₂ group.

Given the analysis, the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is a **triplet**.

Answer: A
