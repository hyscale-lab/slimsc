Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction for an electron. Hmm, let me think about what I know.

The question says the electron is in the spin state (3i, 4). I'm assuming that's a two-component spinor, right? So the state vector is χ = [3i, 4]^T. Wait, but I should double-check the notation. Oh, yeah, in spin states, it's usually a column vector with components corresponding to up and down spins.

The expectation value of an operator is given by the formula <S_y> = ⟨χ| S_y |χ⟩. Right, and S_y is the spin operator in the y-direction. I remember that for spin-½ particles, the spin operators are given by (ħ/2) times the Pauli matrices. So σ_y is the Pauli matrix for y, and S_y would be (ħ/2) * σ_y.

What's σ_y? Oh right, it's the matrix:

[ [0, -i],
  [i, 0] ]

So S_y is (ħ/2) multiplied by that matrix.

So to find the expectation value, I need to compute the product χ† * S_y * χ. Let me write that out step by step.

First, let me compute S_y * χ. Let me represent χ as a column vector:

χ = [3i, 4]^T.

So multiplying σ_y (or S_y) by χ:

S_y * χ = (ħ/2) * [ [0, -i],
                   [i, 0] ] * [3i; 4]

Let me compute that matrix multiplication.

First component: (0)(3i) + (-i)(4) = 0 + (-i)(4) = -4i
Second component: (i)(3i) + (0)(4) = i*3i + 0. Wait, i*3i is 3i², and since i² is -1, that becomes 3*(-1) = -3. So the second component is -3.

Wait, let me double-check that:

Wait, the first row is [0, -i], so when multiplied by [3i,4]^T, it's 0*3i + (-i)*4 = -4i. That's correct.

Second row is [i, 0], so i*3i + 0*4 = 3i² +0 = 3*(-1) = -3. So the result is [ -4i; -3 ].

Wait, but wait. Wait no, because S_y is (ħ/2) multiplied by σ_y, so when I compute S_y * χ, it's (ħ/2) times that matrix multiplication. So S_y * χ = (ħ/2) [ -4i, -3 ]^T? Wait, no, the matrix multiplication gives a column vector. So S_y * χ = (ħ/2) * [ -4i; (-3) ].

So then the next step is to compute χ† * (S_y χ), where χ† is the conjugate transpose of χ.

χ is [3i, 4]^T, so χ† is [ -3, 4* ] because the conjugate transpose would be [ -3, 4* ] but wait, 4 is real, so its conjugate is still 4. So χ† is [ -3, 4 ].

Wait, wait. Wait, the components are [3i,4], so when you take the conjugate transpose, the first element becomes the complex conjugate of 3i, which is -3i, but since it's a row vector, the first element is -3i's conjugate? Wait no. Let me think again.

Wait, the state vector χ is [3i; 4], a column vector. So χ† is the row vector [3i*, 4*], right? Because for a column vector, the conjugate transpose is a row vector where each element is the complex conjugate. So 3i's conjugate is -3i, and 4 is real, so 4. So χ† is [ -3i, 4 ].

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the complex conjugate of 3i is -3i? Because (3i)* is -3i? Wait, no, wait. The complex conjugate of a+bi is a - bi. So 3i is 0 + 3i, so its conjugate is 0 - 3i, which is -3i. Correct. So χ† is [ -3i, 4 ].

So χ† * (S_y χ) is [ -3i, 4 ] multiplied by (ħ/2) [ -4i; -3 ].

Wait, no, let me re-examine. S_y *
