Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let me try to work through it. The question is about identifying an unknown compound based on its spectroscopic data. The options are different chemical formulas, so I need to figure out which one fits all the given data.

First, the FTIR data. The broad peak at 3000 wavenumbers probably indicates an -OH group because O-H stretching typically shows up in that region, especially broad because of hydrogen bonding. Then there are strong peaks at 1700 and 1650. Hmm, 1700 is a classic carbonyl (C=O) stretch, like in a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe an acid. The 1650 peak could be another carbonyl group, maybe conjugated? Or perhaps an aromatic ring with something else. Wait, but 1650 might also be an amide or an aromatic C=C, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe one is a C=O and the other is a conjugated C=C like in a carbonyl group adjacent to something else.

Moving on to the 1H NMR. It says there are peaks for vinyl hydrogens, which are the H's on a double bond. So the compound must have a double bond, maybe in a vinyl group. Also, the presence of multiple peaks suggests a variety of environments for the protons, but the key here is the vinyl H's.

The mass spectrum shows a fragment at m/z 45. I'm trying to think about what fragments give 45. Common fragments: maybe CH3CO+ (which is 43, no), or maybe something like (CH2)2O, but wait. 45 is the molecular weight of CH3CH2O? Wait, molecular weight of C2H5O is 45? Let me calculate: Carbon is 12, H is 1, O is 16. So 2*12=24, 5*1=5, 16=16. 24+5+16=45. Oh, wait, but that's molecular formula C2H5O, but as a fragment. Or maybe it's another group. Alternatively, maybe it's a ketene group or some other structure.

Putting this together: FTIR suggests an -OH (broad peak), and a carbonyl group. The 1700 and 1650 could be two different carbonyls, which makes me think perhaps an ester and something else. Wait, wait, no. Let me think again. An ester has a carbonyl around 1700-1750. Maybe the 1650 is an aromatic ring with conjugated double bonds, like in a benzene ring with something attached. Alternatively, maybe the 1650 is a conjugated carbonyl, like in a conjugated ester or something like that.

Wait, but what about if the compound is something like a diester? For example, maybe a substituted malonic ester. Or maybe it's a cyclic ester, but that might complicate things.

Looking at the options given, the
