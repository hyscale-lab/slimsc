Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is about identifying an unknown compound using some spectroscopic data. I'm a bit rusty on my spectroscopy, but I'll think it through step by step.

So, the problem says the compound was analyzed with FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. Let's look at each of these.

First, the FTIR. A very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm^-1. Broad peaks in IR usually indicate O-H stretching. Like in alcohols or maybe carboxylic acids. Oh wait, but a very broad peak could also be from an alcohol, but if it's a broad peak around 3000, maybe it's an -OH group. Also, there are strong peaks at 1700 and 1650. The 1700 is probably a carbonyl group. The 1650 might be another carbonyl or maybe an aromatic ring with conjugation. Wait, 1650 could be an aromatic ring (like C=C in benzene) or maybe a conjugated carbonyl.

Next, the 1H NMR shows peaks for vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones attached to a double bond, like in alkenes. So the compound probably has a double bond, maybe a vinyl group. So that suggests an alkene is present.

Mass spec shows a fragment at m/z 45. Hmm, 45 is a common fragment. Let me think. The molecular ion for something with a formula like C3H7O+ would have a mass of 57 (since C=12, H=1, O=16: 3*12 +7 +16= 57). Wait, but wait. Maybe it's a fragment. Another thought: 45 is the molecular weight of CH3OCH2CH3? No, that would be ether, but wait, 45 is (CH3)2O, which is dimethyl ether, but that's 45. But wait dimethyl ether is 45? Let me calculate: (CH3O) has a molecular weight of 15 (CH3O is 12 + 3*1 + 16= 31?), no wait, wait. Wait, 45 is 12*3 + 1*3 + 16*0? No, wait. Wait, 45 can be C3H7O? No, that would be (3*12)+(7*1)+16= 36+7+16=59. Hmm. Wait, perhaps it's a fragment with a carbonyl group. Like a ketone or aldehyde. Or maybe a COO group.

Wait, the possible options are:

A) C6H12O2

B) C6H10O

C) C6H10O2

D) C6H12O

So the molecular formulas are given, and the molecular weight would be:

A: 6*12 +12*1 +2*16=72+12+32=116.

B: 6*12 +10 +16=72+10+16=98.

C:6*12 +10 +32=72+10+32=114.

D:6*12 +12 +16=72+12+16=100.

So the molecular ion in the mass spec would be one of these. But the fragment at 45 is possible a smaller fragment.

Wait, 45 is a possible fragment for something like an acetate group. Because the acetate ion is CH3COO-, which has a molecular weight of 60. Wait, but maybe not. Alternatively, think about what breaks off. For example, if the compound is an ester, maybe a fragment with the ester group breaks off, leaving something else. Or maybe it's a ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps the m/z 45 is a fragment that includes a carbonyl group. Let me think. The molecular formula for the fragment would have a molecular weight of 45. So possible formulas could be C3H7O (3*12=36, 7=7, 16=16; 36+7+16=59? No. Wait, 45 is 36 (C3) + 9 (could be H2O?), which is 36 + 16 + (1?), no. Wait, maybe C2H5NO? No, that's not likely. Or maybe it's C3H3O (36 +3 +16=55). Hmm, not matching.

Wait another approach: common fragments with m/z 45. I remember that the tropylium ion (C7H7+) has a higher mass. Alternatively, methyl acetate is C3H6O2, which is 88. Hmm. Wait, perhaps the fragment is from a ketone. Let's think: if the compound has a ketone group, the fragment might lose something. For example, maybe the loss of a methyl group (15) from a larger fragment.

Alternatively, let me think about the possible functional groups. From the IR:

- Broad peak at 3000 cm^-1: likely an O-H group, like an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. But carboxylic acids have very broad O-H stretches, especially in the range of 2500-3300, which is what this is. But sometimes, alcohols can have broad peaks too. Also, the presence of a carbonyl (1700 cm^-1) suggests either a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe an acid. The 1650 cm^-1 could be an aromatic ring (C=C stretching) or possibly a conjugated carbonyl.

The 1H NMR has vinyl hydrogens, so there's a double bond. So perhaps the compound is an aromatic ester or something with both an O-H group and an ester group.

Wait, but let's think about the possible options:

Option A: C6H12O2. The degree of unsaturation would be (2C +2 - H -X + N)/2. Let's assume X and N are zero. So (2*6 +2 -12 -0)/2= (14-12)/2=1. So one degree of unsaturation, which could be a ring or a double bond. But since the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, it's a double bond, so likely one double bond.

Option B: C6H10O. Degrees of unsaturation: (2*
