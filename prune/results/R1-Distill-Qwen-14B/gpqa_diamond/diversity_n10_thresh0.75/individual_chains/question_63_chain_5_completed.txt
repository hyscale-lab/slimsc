Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a diatomic molecule switching energy states when it absorbs a photon. Hmm, let me think. I remember that diatomic molecules can be modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, which I think is also called the non-rigid rotor model. The molecule is in its fundamental state and needs to absorb a photon to switch to the next lowest energy state.

Wait, the fundamental state is the lowest energy state, right? So when it absorbs a photon, it must be moving to a higher energy state. But what's the next state? I think in the rigid rotor model, the energy levels are quantized but for the non-rigid rotor, the bond length can vary, so there's also vibrational energy involved.

Oh wait, the question mentions both rotation and vibration. So the molecule's state is a combination of rotational and vibrational energy levels. The problem is asking about the photon's momentum when it's absorbed to move to the next state with the lowest possible energy.

I think the next state would be the first excited state, which could be either a higher vibrational state or a higher rotational state. But which one would require the least energy? Because the question is about the lowest possible energy increase, so maybe it's the vibrational state that has the smallest energy difference?

Wait, no. Because in molecules, the vibrational energy levels are quantized and the spacing is larger than the rotational spacing. So the transition to the next vibrational state would require a higher energy than a rotational transition. But wait, the fundamental state is the lowest energy—so the next state could be a higher vibrational state or a higher rotational state. Oh, but the problem says "next state with the lowest possible energy," meaning the transition that requires the least energy.

Wait, no, the next state with the lowest possible energy is the one that's just above the fundamental state. So perhaps the molecule is initially in the ground vibrational state and the ground rotational state. So the next state would be either the first vibrational excited state or the first rotational excited state.

But wait, let's think about the energy levels. The energy levels for a diatomic molecule in the rotation-vibration model are a combination of rotational and vibrational energies. The total energy E is the sum of the rotational energy and the vibrational energy. So E_total = E_rot + E_vib.

In the ground state, the rotational energy is in the lowest rotational state (maybe J=0) and the vibrational energy is in the lowest vibrational state (n=0). The next state would be the next possible state, which could be either n=1 (vibrational) or J=1 (rotational). But which of these has a lower energy difference?

The energy spacing for vibration is given by the formula ΔE_vib = (n+1/2) h w - (n+1/2 -1) h w) for each transition. Wait, the energy for a vibrational state is E_vib = (n + 1/2) h w. So the difference between n=0 and n=1 is h w.

For rotation, the energy is E_rot = B J (J + 1), where B is the rotational constant. The spacing between rotational states is 2B (J increases by 1). The rotational constant B is given by B = (h²)/(8 π² μ R²), where μ is the reduced mass.

So, the energy difference for the first rotational transition (from J=0 to J=1) would be E_rot_diff = B*(1)(2) - B*(0)(1) = 2B.

So to find which transition requires less energy, compare h w and 2B.

If h w is less than 2B, then the vibrational transition requires less energy. Otherwise, the rotational transition is smaller.

So, I need to compute both h w and 2B and see which is smaller.

Given data:
Mx = 20 amu
My = 2 amu
R = 2 angstroms = 2e-10 meters
w = 4e14 rad/s

First, compute the reduced mass μ.

μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My) = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) = 40 / 22 = 1.818 amu.

Wait, wait, amu to kg. 1 amu is approximately 1.6605e-27 kg.

So μ = 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg ≈ let's compute that.

1.818 * 1.6605 ≈ let's see. 1.8 * 1.66 is about 2.988. So 1.818 * 1.6605 ≈ ~3.008e-27 kg.

Wait, let me calculate more accurately:

1.818 * 1.6605:

1.8 * 1.6605 = 2.9889
0.018 * 1.6605 ≈ 0.029889
Total ≈ 2.9889 + 0.029889 ≈ 3.0188e-27 kg.

So μ ≈ 3.0188e-27 kg.

Now compute B: B = (h²)/(8 π² μ R²)

h is Planck's constant: 6.626e-34 J·s

So h squared is (6.626e-34)^2 ≈ 4.39e-67 (J^2 s^2)

Compute denominator: 8 π² μ R².

8 π² ≈ 8 * 9.8696 ≈ 78.9568.

μ is 3.0188e-27 kg.

R is 2e-10 m.

R squared is (2e-10)^2 =4e-20 m².

So denominator: 78.9568 * (3.0188e-27 kg) * (4e-20 m²) = 

Let me compute step by step.

First, 3.0188e-27 *4e-20 = 12.075e-47 = 1.2075e-46 kg m².

Multiply by 78.9568: 78.9568 * 1.2075e-46 ≈ let's calculate 78.9568 * 1.2075 ≈ 78.9568 * 1.2 is about 94.75, 78.9568 * 0.0075 ≈ 0.592. So total approx 95.34. So 95.34e-46 = 9.534e-45.

So denominator is 9.534e-45 kg m².

So B = (4.39e-67)/(9.534e-45) = approx 4.39 / 9.534 ≈ 0.46, times 1e-67+45 = 1e-22.

So B ≈ 0.46e-22 J·s²/m²? Wait, units? Let me think again. No, the units for B would be in Joules (since the rotational energy is in J).

Wait, let me compute the exact number.

4.39e-67 /9.534e-45 = (4.39 /9.534) * 1e-67+45 = 0.46 * 1e-22 = 4.6e-23 J.

Wait, 4.39 / 9.534 ≈ 0.46, yes. So B ≈ 4.6e-23 J.

Wait, but wait, 4.39e-67 /9.534e-45 = (4.39/9.534) * 1e-22 = 0.46 * 1e-22 = 4.6e-23 J.

But wait, let me double-check:

Wait 4.39 / 9.534 = 0.46, yes.

So 0.46e-22 is 4.6e-23.

So B is about 4.6e-23 J.

Then 2B = 9.2e-23 J.

Now, what's the energy difference for the vibrational transition?

ΔE_vib = h w.

h is 6.626e-34 J·s.

w is 4e14 rad/s.

So ΔE_vib = 6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.65e-19 J.

Wait, let me compute that: 6.626e-34 *4e14 = (6.626*4) * 1e-34+14 = 26.504e-20 J = 2.6504e-19 J.

Now, which is bigger: 2B=9.2e-23 J or ΔE_vib=2.65e-19 J?

Well, 2.65e-19 is much bigger than 9.2e-23. Wait, 2.65e-19 is 265e-21, and 9.2e-23 is 0.92e-22. So 2B is 9.2e-23, which is smaller than the vibrational transition.

So the smallest energy jump is the rotational one, so the molecule would absorb a photon that provides 2B energy.

Wait, but wait, the question is about the momentum of the photon. So once we find the energy ΔE, we can relate it to the photon's momentum.

Photon's energy is E = pc, where p is the momentum and c is the speed of light.

So p = E/(c).

So for the rotational transition, ΔE_rot = 2B =9.2e-23 J.

So p = (9.2e-23 J) / (3e8 m/s) = 3.066e-31 kg·m/s.

Wait, but let me compute exactly.

9.2e-23 / 3e8 = (9.2 /3 )e-31 = 3.066e-31 kg m/s.

Wait, but wait, that's not one of the options. The options are all in 1e-27 or 1e-28 range.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Let me go back. Maybe I messed up the calculation of B.

Wait, let's recalculate B.

B = (h^2) / (8 π² μ R² )

h = 6.626e-34 J·s
h squared = (6.626e-34)^2 = approx 4.39e-67 J² s².

μ is 3.0188e-27 kg.

R is 2e-10 meters.

So R squared is (2e-10)^2 =4e-20 m².

Putting it all into the denominator:

8 π² μ R² = 8 * (π^2) * (3.0188e-27 kg) * (4e-20 m² )

Compute 8 * π^2 ≈ 8 *9.8696 ≈ 78.9568.

Multiply by 3.0188e-27 kg: 78.9568 * 3.0188e-27 ≈ approximately 78.9568 *3=236.87e-27, more accurately:

3.0188e-27 *78.9568 = ?

3.0188 *78.9568 = let's compute.

3 *78.9568=236.8704

0.0188 *78.9568 ≈ approx 1.485.

Total ≈ 236.87 +1.485= 238.355e-27 → 2.38355e-25 kg m²?

Wait, no, because 3.0188e-27 kg *78.9568 = approximately 2.38355e-25 kg.

Then multiply by R² (4e-20 m²): 2.38355e-25 *4e-20 = 9.534e-45 kg m².

So denominator is 9.534e-45.

So B = 4.39e-67 / 9.534e-45 = approx 4.39 /9.534 = 0.46e-22 =4.6e-23 J.

Wait, that's what I had before.

So 2B is 9.2e-23 J.

So the photon's energy is 9.2e-23 J.

Now, E = pc → p = E / c = 9.2e-23 J / (3e8 m/s) = (9.2 /3) * 1e-31 kg m/s.

9.2 /3 is about 3.0666667.

So p ≈3.0667e-31 kg m/s.

Wait, that's 3.0667e-31 N·s. Because 1 N·s = 1 kg·m/s.

But looking at the options:

A)1.9e-28

B)2.3e-27

C)1.1e-27

D)1.4e-28

Hmm, my calculation leads to 3.0667e-31 Ns, which is 3.067e-31. But none of the options are that small. The smallest option is D, 1.4e-28.

Wait, perhaps I made an error in calculating B. Let me double-check the calculation.

Wait, maybe I messed up the units somewhere. Let's see:

μ is 3.0188e-27 kg.

R is 2e-10 meters.

So R squared is 4e-20 m².

Denominator is 8 π² μ R² = 8 * π² *3.0188e-27 kg *4e-20 m².

Compute that step by step:

8 * π² ≈ 78.9568.

Multiply by μ: 78.9568 *3.0188e-27 ≈ 78.9568 *3e-27 is 2.3687e-25, but more accurately:

3.0188 is 3 + 0.0188.

So 78.9568 *3 = 236.8704,

78.9568 * 0.0188 = approx 1.485.

So total is 236.8704 +1.485 = 238.355e-27 → 2.38355e-25 kg.

Multiply by R² (4e-20 m²): 2.38355e-25 kg *4e-20 m² =9.534e-45 kg m².

So denominator is 9.534e-45.

B = (6.626e-34)^2 / denominator.

Wait wait, wait. h is 6.626e-34 J·s.

So h squared is (6.626e-34)^2 = (6.626)^2 *1e-68 → 43.90e-68 =4.39e-67 J² s².

Wait, but B has units of Joules because it's (h²)/(8 π² μ R²). Let me check the units.

h has units of J·s.

So h² is (J·s)^2.

μ is kg.

R is meters.

So denominator units: 8 π² μ R² → kg * m².

So units of B: (J² s²) / (kg m²).

Wait J is kg m²/s².

So substituting J:

B = ( (kg m²/s²)^2 s² ) / (kg m²) ) = (kg² m^4 / s^2) ) / (kg m²) ) = kg m² / s² → which is J.

So units are correct.

Wait, maybe the problem is that I should consider the vibrational transition because the question is about the next state. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the model.

Ah! Wait, the question says the model is the quantum rotation-vibration model, which I think is the non-rigid rotor model. In that model, the vibrational energy levels are considered along with the rotational levels.

So the fundamental state is the lowest vibrational state (n=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0). So the next state could be either n=1 or J=1.

But we need the transition that requires the smallest energy.

Earlier, I found that the rotational transition (J=0→1) requires 9.2e-23 J, and the vibrational (n=0→1) requires 2.65e-19 J.

So the rotational transition is lower in energy, so the photon's momentum would correspond to the 9.2e-23 J.

Wait, but why is the rotational transition higher in energy than the vibrational one? Because in this case, the vibrational transition requires a larger energy jump.

Wait, no. 9.2e-23 is less than 2.65e-19. So the rotational transition requires less energy. So the molecule would absorb a photon with energy 9.2e-23 J to make that rotational transition.

But wait, another possibility: perhaps the molecule can't transition to J=1 from J=0 while still being in the same vibrational state. Maybe it's the combination of J and n that's considered.

Wait, in some models, the energy is a sum of the rotational and vibrational contributions. So the ground state is the lowest possible J and n. The next possible state could be either higher J or higher n.

But the problem is asking for the next state with the lowest energy. So the next state in energy would be the one that requires the least energy to reach. That would be the rotational transition, because 9.2e-23 J is less than 2.65e-19 J.

So the photon's momentum would be based on 9.2e-23 J.

But earlier, the calculation for p gave 3.066e-31 N s, which is 3e-31 N s. But all the options are in the 1e-27 to 1e-28 range. Hmm, that's way off.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check again.

Wait, maybe I mixed up the calculation of the photon's momentum. E = pc → p = E / c.

E is 9.2e-23 J.

c is 3e8 m/s.

So p = 9.2e-23 J / 3e8 m/s.

J is kg·m²/s², so (kg·m²/s²) / (m/s) ) = kg·m/s → which is N·s, correct.

So 9.2e-23 /3e8 = (9.2/3) * 1e-31 → 3.0667e-31 Ns.

But the options are much larger. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of B.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the next state with a combination of rotational and vibrational levels. Wait, perhaps the molecule can't transition to a higher rotational state without also having some vibrational excitation?

No, I think in the non-rigid rotor model, the rotational and vibrational states are treated as separate. But maybe the energy levels are quantized more, and the next state after the ground state (n=0, J=0) is not the next J but the first vibrational level.

Wait, maybe I got the energy levels wrong. Let me think.

In the rigid rotor-vibrator model, the energy levels are given by E = E_rot + E_vib. E_rot = B J (J+1), E_vib = (n +1/2) h w.

So for the ground state, J=0 and n=0. The next possible states are:

n=1, J=0 → E = (1.5) h w + 0.

Or J=1, n=0 → E = 2B + 0.5 h w (wait, no, E_rot for J=1 is B*(1)(2)=2B).

Wait, no, E_rot is B J (J+1).

So J=0: E_rot=0.

J=1: E_rot = B*(1)(2)=2B.

Similarly, n=1: E_vib= (1 + 1/2) h w = (3/2) h w.

So the total energy for (n=1, J=0) would be (3/2) h w.

For (n=0, J=1) it's 2B.

Comparing 2B and (3/2)hw.

Which is smaller?

We have B=4.6e-23 J.

So 2B =9.2e-23 J.

h w=6.626e-34 *4e14 =2.65e-19 J.

(3/2)hw=3.975e-19 J.

So 2B is much smaller than (3/2)hw.

So the energy needed for J=1 is lower than for n=1.

So the molecule would transition to J=1, which requires 2B energy.

So the photon's energy is 9.2e-23 J.

Wait, but I'm getting p=3e-31 Ns, which is way smaller than any of the options. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of B.

Let me recalculate B.

B = (h²) / (8 π² μ R² )

h =6.626e-34 J s.

h squared = (6.626e-34)^2 = approx 4.39e-67 J² s².

Denominator: 8 π² μ R².

μ is (20 * 2) / (20 +2) =40/22 ≈1.818 amu.

1 amu =1.6605e-27 kg.

So μ=1.818 *1.6605e-27 kg ≈3.018e-27 kg.

R is 2 angstroms =2e-10 meters.

So R squared is (2e-10)^2=4e-20 m².

Denominator:8 * π² * μ * R² =8*(9.8696) *3.018e-27 *4e-20.

Compute 8 *9.8696 ≈78.9568.

Multiply 78.9568 *3.018e-27 = 78.9568 *3e-27 = 236.87e-27 =2.3687e-25.

Multiply by 4e-20: 2.3687e-25 *4e-20 =9.4748e-45.

So denominator=9.4748e-45.

Now, B=4.39e-67 /9.4748e-45 = 4.39 /9.4748 ≈0.4625 → 0.4625e-22 =4.625e-23 J.

So 2B is 9.25e-23 J.

So E_photon=9.25e-23 J.

p= E/c.

c=3e8 m/s.

So p=9.25e-23 /3e8 =3.083e-31 Ns.

Still, that's 3e-31 Ns, but the options don't have this.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula for B.

Another thought: I thought the rotational energy levels are given by E_rot = B J (J+1), but maybe in some models, the energy is divided by 2. Wait, sometimes the rotational energy is given as E_rot = (h²)/(8 π² I) * J (J+1), where I is the moment of inertia.

Wait, that's the same as B J (J+1), because B= h²/(8 π² I μ).

Wait, no, wait, B is defined as h²/(8 π² I μ) where I is the moment of inertia, which is μ R².

So B is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the Raman transition, which involves simultaneous rotational and vibrational changes. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the first allowed vibrational transition, which may have a higher energy than the rotational.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the next state in terms of the total energy, which could involve a combination of rotation and vibration. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I misread the question. Let me read the question again.

The question says: the molecule is in its fundamental state. What momentum should an absorbed photon have, in order for the molecule to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy.

Ah, the 'fundamental state' is the state with the lowest possible energy. So the next state would be the one with the next higher energy, which is the smallest possible delta E.

So the next state is the state with the next higher energy, regardless of whether it's rotation or vibration.

So which transition gives the smallest increase in energy: either the first rotational (J=0→1) or first vibrational (n=0→1).

We found that the rotational transition requires less energy, so the photon's energy is 9.2e-23 J.

But the options don't match.

Wait, so perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of B.

Wait, let me compute B again more accurately.

Compute μ again.

Mx=20, My=2.

μ = (20 *2)/(20+2) )=40/22= 1.81818... amu.

1.81818 amu *1.6605e-27 kg/amu → 1.81818 *1.6605= approx.

1.8 *1.6605=2.9889.

0.01818 *1.6605≈0.02999.

So total μ≈3.0188e-27 kg.

R=2e-10 m.

So R squared=4e-20 m².

Denominator:8 π² μ R² =8*(9.8696)*3.0188e-27 *4e-20.

Compute 8*9.8696=78.9568.

3.0188e-27 *4e-20 =1.2075e-46.

Multiply by 78.9568: 78.9568 *1.2075e-46 = let's compute 78.9568 *1.2075.

78.9568 *1=78.9568.

78.9568 *0.2075 ≈78.9568 *0.2=15.79136; 78.9568 *0.0075=0.592176. So total 15.79136+0.592176=16.3835.

So total 78.9568 +16.3835 ≈95.3403e-46.

But wait, 78.9568 *1.2075e-46 = (78.9568 *1.2075 ) *1e-46 ≈95.3403e-46 → 9.53403e-45.

So denominator is 9.53403e-45.

Numerator: h squared is (6.626e-34)^2 = (6.626)^2 *1e-68.

6.626^2 = approx 43.90.

So 43.90e-68 =4.390e-67.

So B=4.390e-67 /9.53403e-45 ≈0.4603e-22 =4.603e-23 J.

So 2B=9.206e-23 J.

Hmm, but the options are way higher. So perhaps the energy is that of the vibrational transition.

Wait, because 9.2e-23 J is much smaller than the vibrational.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the question is considering the next state as the first excited vibrational state. Because in molecules, sometimes the vibrational transitions are allowed and are the main way energy is absorbed.

Wait, but why would that be the case?

Wait, the question says the molecule is in the fundamental state, which is the lowest energy state. So the next state is the one with the next higher energy, which is the smallest possible delta E.

Which between 2B and h w is smaller?

h w is 2.65e-19 J, 2B is 9.2e-23 J.

So 2B is smaller. Thus, the photon's energy is 9.2e-23 J, leading to p=3e-31 Ns.

But options don't have this. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the model expects me to find the vibrational transition.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the photon's momentum for the vibrational transition.

E_photon_vib = h w =6.626e-34 *4e14 =2.65e-19 J.

p = E/c =2.65e-19 /3e8 =8.83e-28 Ns.

Looking at the options:

A)1.9e-28

C)1.1e-27

D)1.4e-28.

So 8.83e-28 is closest to option A (1.9e-28) but higher than A.

Wait, but 8.83e-28 is about 8.83e-28 Ns.

Wait, the options are:

A) 1.9e-28

B)2.3e-27

C)1.1e-27

D)1.4e-28.

Hmm, 8.83e-28 is in between A and D.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in E_photon_vib.

Let me recalculate E_photon_vib.

h=6.626e-34 J s.

w=4e14 rad/s.

ΔE = h w =6.626e-34 *4e14 = (6.626 *4) *1e-34+14=26.504e-20 J=2.6504e-19 J.

p = E/c =2.6504e-19 /3e8 ≈8.8347e-28 N s.

Hmm, 8.83e-28 Ns is 8.8e-28.

But none of the options match exactly. The closest is option A, 1.9e-28, but it's about half of that.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the photon's energy to be the sum of the rotational and vibrational changes. But that wouldn't make sense because the next state would be the one with the least energy.

Alternatively, perhaps the model isn't considering the rotational transition because it's forbidden or because the molecule is vibrationally excited.

Wait, perhaps I misunderstood the model. The non-rigid rotor model accounts for the bond length changing during vibration. So perhaps the rotational energy is quantized in a different way.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the question is using the selection rules for vibrational and rotational transitions.

Wait, but the question states that the molecule is in its fundamental state, and we're looking for the transition to the next state with the lowest possible energy.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that a photon must supply enough energy to overcome both the rotational and vibrational transitions, but that's not how it works.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the energy levels. The fundamental state is the lowest vibrational state (n=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0). The next state could be either n=1, J=0 or J=1, n=0.

Which of these requires less energy?

As calculated, J=1 (2B) is 9.2e-23 J, and n=1 is (3/2) hw=3.975e-19 J. So the rotational transition requires less energy.

So the photon's energy is 9.2e-23 J, leading to p=3.066e-31 Ns.

But the options don't have this.

Hmm. Perhaps I made a mistake in computing the reduced mass.

Wait, wait. Mx=20 amu, My=2 amu.

μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My) = (20 * 2 )/(22) =40/22= 1.81818 amu.

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, maybe I should have used the bond length in meters not angstroms? No, R is given as 2 angstroms, so 2e-10 m.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is using the harmonic oscillator model, which considers only the vibrational energy.

But no, the question mentions the rotation-vibration model.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the transition from J=0 to J=2, but that would require 6B, which is even higher.

I'm getting stuck here. According to my calculations, the correct answer should be p≈3e-31 N·s, but none of the options match. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Alternative approach: Maybe the question is about the fundamental vibrational state, and the next state is the first vibrational excited state.

In that case, the photon's energy is h w =2.65e-19 J, leading to p=8.83e-28 Ns. But the options don't have that either.

Wait, maybe the question is considering the molecule's transition to a higher vibrational state and a higher rotational state together. But that would require a higher energy.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm using the wrong formula for B. Let me check that.

B is given by (h²)/(8 π² μ R²).

Wait, another way to write B is B = (h²)/(8 π² I), where I is the moment of inertia.

And I= μ R².

So yes, the formula is correct.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation of the denominator.

Wait, denominator:8 π² μ R² = 8 π² *3.018e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2.

(2e-10)^2=4e-20.

So 8 π² *3.018e-27 *4e-20 = 8*9.8696 *3.018e-27 *4e-20.

Wait, 8*9.8696≈78.9568.

So 78.9568 *3.018e-27 = approx 2.378e-25.

Multiply by 4e-20: 2.378e-25 *4e-20 =9.512e-45.

So denominator is 9.512e-45.

B=4.39e-67 /9.512e-45 ≈4.61e-23 J.

Same as before.

So photon's momentum is 4.61e-23 /3e8 =1.537e-31 Ns.

Still way below the options.

Wait, looking at the options again:

A)1.9e-28

B)2.3e-27

C)1.1e-27

D)1.4e-28.

Hmm. Could I have made a mistake in the units of R? Say, R is in meters, not angstroms.

Wait, R is given as 2 angstroms, which is 2e-10 meters. That's correct.

Wait, another thought: Perhaps the problem is considering the photon's energy as the sum of both a rotational and vibrational transition. But that would give a much higher energy than either.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is using a different formula for the energy of the photon, such as E = (h c)/lambda, but I don't think that's applicable here.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the denominator when calculating B.

Wait, another thought: could the problem be considering the reduced mass in atomic mass units instead of converting to kilograms?

Wait, μ is in kilograms, right. Because when calculating B, the units need to be in kg, meters, etc.

Wait, if I forgot to convert μ from amu to kg, that would give a wrong B value.

Wait, earlier, I used μ=3.018e-27 kg. If I forgot to convert, μ would be 3.018e-27 amu, which is wrong.

But no, I did convert μ from amu to kg, so that can't be the problem.

Hmm... I'm stuck. According to my calculations, the correct photon momentum is around 3e-31 Ns, which isn't one of the options. Perhaps I made a mistake in understanding the question.

Wait, the question says the molecule is in its fundamental state. Maybe the fundamental state is the first excited state, but that contradicts what I know.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the next state in terms of the total energy, which combines both rotation and vibration. But I can't think of a way to combine them for the next state.

Alternatively, perhaps the model expects me to consider the transition to the next vibrational state, not the rotational.

In that case, the photon's momentum would be 8.83e-28 Ns, but that's not an option. The closest option is D:1.4e-28.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of p.

Wait, E_photon_vib=2.65e-19 J.

p=E/c=2.65e-19 /3e8 =8.83e-28 Ns.

Hmm, but the options don't include that. Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the photon's momentum for the first vibrational transition, not the rotational.

In that case, the correct answer would be 8.83e-28, but the options don't have it. So perhaps the correct answer is not present, but among the options, the closest is D:1.4e-28.

Wait, but that's not close to 8.8e-28. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the photon's energy as the sum of the rotational and vibrational transitions, but that would be even higher.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the transition from J=0 to J=2, but that would give a higher energy.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Another approach: perhaps the question is actually considering the energy required for the first vibrational transition (n=0 →n=1), which gives the photon's momentum as p=8.83e-28 Ns. None of the options match exactly, but option C is 1.1e-27, which is about 10 times larger.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculations. Let me recalculate the photon's momentum for the vibrational transition.

E_photon_vib = h w =6.626e-34 *4e14 =2.65e-19 J.

p = E_photon /c =2.65e-19 /3e8 =8.83e-28 Ns.

But none of the options match. So perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but the closest is option A:1.9e-28, which is about half of my calculated value.

But why would that be the case? Did I make a mistake in the calculation of h w?

Wait, h=6.626e-34 J s.

w=4e14 rad/s.

h w =6.626e-34 *4e14 = (6.626 *4) *1e-34+14 =26.504 *1e-20 =2.6504e-19 J.

Yes, correct.

Hmm. I'm stuck, but based on calculations, the correct p is approx 3e-31 Ns for the rotational transition, and 8.8e-28 Ns for the vibrational transition.

Since neither matches the options, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the question is asking about the photon's momentum for the transition to the next rotational state, which would be J=1, but in the same vibrational state (n=0). So I need to find the photon's momentum for that.

Which would be p=3.066e-31 Ns, but that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps I should re-express the answer in different units.

Wait, 3.0667e-31 Ns is 3.0667e-31 kg·m/s.

But none of the options are in that range.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated B.

Wait, perhaps I should compute B differently. Let me try another approach to compute B.

B = (h²) / (8 π² I ), where I is the moment of inertia.

I=μ R².

μ= (Mx My)/(Mx + My) amu.

Wait, 1 amu =1.6605e-27 kg.

So μ= (20 *2 )/(22) amu = (40)/(22) amu ≈1.818 amu.

So μ=1.818 *1.6605e-27 kg ≈3.018e-27 kg.

R=2e-10 m.

So I=μ R² =3.018e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 =3.018e-27 *4e-20=1.207e-46 kg m².

Now, B= (6.626e-34)^2 / (8 π² *1.207e-46 )

Compute numerator: (6.626e-34)^2 =4.39e-67.

Denominator:8 π² *1.207e-46 = 8 *9.8696 *1.207e-46 ≈78.9568 *1.207e-46 ≈95.3e-46 =9.53e-45.

So B=4.39e-67 /9.53e-45 ≈4.60e-23 J.

So same as before.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the transition from J=0 to J=1, but in the same vibrational state, which requires 2B=9.2e-23 J, so p=3.066e-31 Ns.

But the options don't have this.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is looking for the photon's momentum for the first vibrational transition (n=0→1), which requires p=8.83e-28 Ns. But that's not an option either.

Wait, looking at the options, option A is 1.9e-28 Ns.

Which is about half of 3.8e-28, which is about half of my 8.8e-28. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different value for w, but the question states w=4e14 rad/s.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the formula for the vibrational energy as (n+1)hw, but that would change the energy.

Wait, no, the standard vibrational energy is (n +1/2) h w.

So, the energy difference between n=0 and n=1 is h w.

Wait, maybe the problem is using a different model where the energy levels are (n) h w, making the energy difference h w. But that would give the same result.

Hmm.

I'm stuck. According to the calculations, the correct answer isn't among the options. But perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the transition to the next possible state, which could be a combination of J and n. For instance, the next state could be J=1, n=0, which requires 2B=9.2e-23 J.

So p=3.066e-31 Ns, but that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the transition to n=1, which requires h w=2.65e-19 J, p=8.83e-28 Ns.

But again, no option matches.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of h w. Let me recheck.

h=6.626e-34 J s.

w=4e14 rad/s.

h w=6.626e-34 *4e14 = (6.626 *4) =26.504 → 26.504e-20 J =2.6504e-19 J.

Yes, correct.

p= E/c=2.6504e-19 /3e8 = approx 8.83e-28 Ns.

But none of the options match.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is expecting me to calculate the photon's momentum for the transition to the next vibrational state, but using a different formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the energy in terms of frequency v instead of angular frequency w.

Because sometimes, E=h v where v =w/(2 pi). So if I mistakenly used v instead of w, I would get a smaller energy.

Wait, in the question, w is given as 4e14 rad/s.

If I used v =w/(2 pi) =4e14/(6.283)≈6.366e13 Hz.

Then h v=6.626e-34 *6.366e13 ≈4.214e-20 J.

So p=4.214e-20 /3e8 ≈1.405e-28 Ns.

Looking at the options, option D is 1.4e-28 Ns.

Ah! That must be it. I think I see the mistake. I assumed w is the frequency, but perhaps the question gives w as the angular frequency. So when I calculated E=h w, I used the angular frequency, which is incorrect. Instead, I should use E=h v, where v is the frequency, which is w/(2 pi).

So let me recalculate.

w=4e14 rad/s → v= w/(2 pi) ≈4e14 /6.283 ≈6.366e13 Hz.

E_photon_vib = h v =6.626e-34 *6.366e13 = approx 4.214e-20 J.

Then p=4.214e-20 /3e8 =1.405e-28 Ns.

That's close to option D, which is 1.4e-28 Ns.

So the correct answer would be option D.


To determine the momentum of the photon required for the diatomic molecule to transition to the next state with the lowest possible energy, we analyze the energy differences between the rotational and vibrational transitions.

### Key Information:
- **Masses**: \( M_x = 20 \, \text{amu}, M_y = 2 \, \text{amu} \)
- **Bond length**: \( R = 2 \, \text{angstroms} = 2 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m} \)
- **Angular frequency**: \( \omega = 4 \times 10^{14} \, \text{rad/s} \)
- **Reduced mass**: \( \mu = \frac{M_x \cdot M_y}{M_x + M_y} = \frac{20 \cdot 2}{20 + 2} = 1.818 \, \text{amu} = 3.018 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg} \)
- **Planck's constant**: \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \)
- **Speed of light**: \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \)

### Energy Transitions:
1. **Rotational Transition**:  
   The rotational energy levels are given by \( E_{\text{rot}} = B J (J+1) \), where \( B = \frac{h^2}{8 \pi^2 \mu R^2} \).  
   Substituting the values:  
   \[
   B = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})^2}{8 \pi^2 (3.018 \times 10^{-27}) (2 \times 10^{-10})^2} \approx 4.6 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}
   \]  
   The energy difference for the transition from \( J=0 \) to \( J=1 \) is \( \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = 2B = 9.2 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \).

2. **Vibrational Transition**:  
   The vibrational energy levels are given by \( E_{\text{vib}} = \left(n + \frac{1}{2}\right) h \omega \).  
   The energy difference for the transition from \( n=0 \) to \( n=1 \) is \( \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = h \omega = (6.626 \times 10^{-34}) (4 \times 10^{14}) = 2.65 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \).

### Comparison:
The rotational transition requires \( \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = 9.2 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \), while the vibrational transition requires \( \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = 2.65 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \). The rotational transition requires significantly less energy, so the photon must have energy corresponding to the rotational transition.

### Photon Momentum:
The momentum of the photon is related to its energy by \( p = \frac{E}{c} \). Substituting \( \Delta E_{\text{rot}} \):  
\[
p = \frac{9.2 \times 10^{-23}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 3.07 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{N·s}
\]  
However, this value does not match any of the provided options. Reassessing the problem, it appears the question may have used the vibrational transition instead. For the vibrational transition:  
\[
p = \frac{\Delta E_{\text{vib}}}{c} = \frac{2.65 \times 10^{-19}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 8.83 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{N·s}
\]  
This value also does not match the options. Upon further inspection, the problem might have used the **frequency** \( v = \frac{\omega}{2\pi} \) instead of the angular frequency \( \omega \). Recalculating the vibrational transition energy with \( v = \frac{4 \times 10^{14}}{2\pi} \approx 6.37 \times 10^{13} \, \text{Hz} \):  
\[
\Delta E_{\text{vib}} = h v = (6.626 \times 10^{-34}) (6.37 \times 10^{13}) \approx 4.21 \times 10^{-20} \, \text{J}
\]  
The corresponding momentum is:  
\[
p = \frac{\Delta E_{\text{vib}}}{c} = \frac{4.21 \times 10^{-20}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 1.40 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{N·s}
\]  
This matches **Option D**.

### Final Answer:
The momentum of the photon required for the transition is approximately \( 1.4 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{N·s} \).

**Answer: D**
