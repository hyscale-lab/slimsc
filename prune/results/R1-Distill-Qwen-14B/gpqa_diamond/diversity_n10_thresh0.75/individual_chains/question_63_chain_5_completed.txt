Okay, so I've got this physics problem about a diatomic molecule's transition when it absorbs a photon. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on the quantum rotation-vibration model, but let's try to think it through.

The problem says the molecule is in its fundamental state and needs to switch to the next state with the lowest energy. Wait, what's the fundamental state? Oh right, the fundamental state is the lowest energy state, so I guess the next state is the first excited state.

So, the molecule is modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model. That means it's a non-rigid rotor, right? But wait, in the rigid rotor approximation, the bond length is fixed, but the non-rigid allows for some stretching. But I'm not sure if that affects the photon momentum calculation. Maybe I should focus on the vibrational and rotational energy levels.

Wait, the question is about a photon being absorbed. So, the energy of the photon must match the energy difference between the initial and final states. The initial state is the fundamental, so the next state's energy is higher by the energy corresponding to the photon's frequency.

But what's the energy difference? Let's think about the possible transitions. In the rotation-vibration model, the energy levels are a combination of rotational and vibrational energies. The fundamental state is usually the ground state of both rotation and vibration. If the molecule absorbs a photon, it can transition to a higher state either by changing rotation, vibration, or both.

Wait, but the question specifies the "next state with the lowest possible energy." So it might be the first state that's higher in energy, regardless of whether it's rotation or vibration. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe the question is considering only vibrational transitions, but I'm not certain.

Wait, the given parameters include the angular frequency of vibration, w, which is 4e14 rad/s. So the vibrational energy difference would be based on that. The rotational energy levels are given by something else, probably involving the rotational constant.

Wait, the energy levels for rotation in a diatomic molecule are given by E_rot = B * J*(J+1), where B is the rotational constant. But B is related to the moment of inertia, which depends on the masses and the bond length.

The moment of inertia I is (μ * R²), where μ is the reduced mass. So, μ = (Mx * My)/(Mx + My). Let me calculate μ first.

Mx is 20 amu, My is 2 amu. So μ = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) = 40 / 22 = approximately 1.818 amu. Oh wait, but I need to convert that into kg for SI units. 1 amu is 1.6605e-27 kg, so 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 ≈ 3.01e-27 kg.

The bond length R is 2 angstroms. 1 angstrom is 1e-10 meters, so R = 2e-10 m.

So I = μ R² = 3.01e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.01e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.204e-46 kg m².

The rotational constant B is h/(8π²I), but wait, no, B is ħ / (2I), where ħ is h/(2π). Wait, let me get that right. The rotational energy levels are E_rot = B J (J+1), where B = ħ²/(2I). Hmm, no, wait: The rotational constant B is defined as ℏ / (2I), where I is the moment of inertia. Alternatively, sometimes it's written as B = ħ²/(2I). I think I might be mixing definitions.

Let me get it straight. The rotational energy levels are E_rot = (ħ²/(2I)) J (J + 1), which can be written as E_rot = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant, which is ħ²/(2I). Wait, no, actually, B is ħ/(2I) multiplied by something else. Alternatively, I think B is h/(8π²I), but I'm a bit confused. Maybe I should look up the formula, but since I can't, I'll try to think it through.

Alternatively, another approach: the rotational energy levels are given by E_rot = (J (J+1) h² )/(8π² I), where h is Planck's constant. So, B is h²/(8π² I), so E_rot = B J (J+1). So B is h^2/(8pi^2 I).

Wait, Planck's constant h is 6.626e-34 J s. So let's compute B.

I is 1.204e-46 kg m².

So B = h²/(8 π² I) = ( (6.626e-34)^2 ) / (8 * (pi)^2 * 1.204e-46 ) .

Let me compute numerator and denominator.

Numerator: (6.626e-34)^2 ≈ (6.626)^2 = 43.9, so 43.9e-68 = 4.39e-67.

Denominator: 8 * (pi)^2 ≈ 8 * 9.8696 ≈ 78.957. So 78.957 * 1.204e-46 ≈ 78.957 * 1.204 is like 95.1, so 95.1e-46 = 9.51e-45.

So B ≈ (4.39e-67) / (9.51e-45) = approximately 4.615e-23 J.

Wait, that seems really small, but maybe that's correct. Now, the vibrational energy levels are given by E_vib = (h w)(ν + 1/2), where ν is the vibrational quantum number. The fundamental state is ν=0, so the first excited state would be ν=1, leading to an energy increase of h w.

So the energy difference for a vibrational transition from ν=0 to ν=1 is ΔE_vib = h w (1 + 1/2 - 0 - 1/2 ) = h w * 1.

Wait, the energy levels are E_vib = (1/2) h w + h w ν. So the difference between ν=0 and ν=1 is h w (1) = h w.

So if the molecule is in the fundamental state, which is the lowest energy, the next possible lowest state would be where either ν increases by 1 (vibrational), or J increases by 1 (rotational). But which transition requires a lower energy? Because the question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy, so whichever has the lower energy.

Wait, but the given options are all in the order of 1e-28 to 1e-27 Ns. So perhaps it's the vibrational transition.

Wait, the energy of a photon is E_photon = h f = h (w/(2pi)), since w is angular frequency. Wait, no, because w (omega) is 2pi f, so f = w/(2pi). So E_photon = h * (w/(2 pi)).

Wait, but wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The angular frequency w is related to the regular frequency f by w = 2 pi f. So f = w/(2 pi). So the energy of a photon with frequency f is E = h f = h * w/(2 pi).

So, E_photon = h w/(2 pi). But what is the energy required for the transition?

Wait, the question is about the molecule switching to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So it's looking for the transition with the smallest possible energy increase. So which transition requires less energy: a vibrational or a rotational?

Given the numbers, vibrational transitions are usually stronger (higher energy) than rotational ones, because bond vibrations involve much higher frequencies. Let's compute the energies.

Compute the rotational energy difference between J=0 and J=1. The rotational energy is E_rot = B J (J+1).

So for J=0: E0 = 0.

For J=1: E1 = B * 1*(2) = 2B.

So ΔE_rot = 2B.

Earlier, I found B ≈ 4.615e-23 J. So ΔE_rot = 2 * 4.615e-23 = 9.23e-23 J.

Now, the vibrational energy difference is ΔE_vib = h w.

h is 6.626e-34 J s. w is 4e14 rad/s.

ΔE_vib = 6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.65e-19 J.

Comparing the two, ΔE_rot is 9.23e-23 J, which is way smaller than ΔE_vib's 2.65e-19 J. So the rotational transition requires much less energy than the vibrational transition.

Wait, but the question says, the molecule is in its fundamental state. The fundamental state is the lowest energy, which would have J=0 and ν=0.

So the next possible state could be either J=1 (rotational), ν=0, or ν=1 (vibrational), J=0.

Which requires less energy? The rotational transition is much lower energy, so the next state with the lowest possible energy is when J increases to 1. So the photon energy should match the rotational energy difference.

But the question is about the momentum of the photon. So the energy of the photon must be equal to the energy difference ΔE_rot = 9.23e-23 J.

So E_photon = ΔE_rot = 9.23e-23 J.

The energy of a photon is also E = p c, where p is momentum and c is speed of light (approx 3e8 m/s). So p = E / c.

Wait, but wait, photons have energy E = pc, so p = E / c.

So p = 9.23e-23 J / 3e8 m/s = approx 3.077e-31 kg m/s.

Wait, but none of the options are anywhere near that. The options are in the 1e-27 Ns range. Wait, 1 Ns is 1 kg m/s. So 3e-31 kg m/s is 3e-31 Ns, which is way smaller than the options given. So that can't be right. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe I'm miscalculating. Let me double-check.

Wait, maybe the question isn't about a rotational transition but a vibrational one. Because the options are much larger than what I just got for the rotational case.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of B, the rotational constant.

Let me recalculate B.

B is h²/(8 pi² I).

h is 6.626e-34 J s.

h squared is (6.626e-34)^2 = approx 4.39e-67 J² s².

Denominator: 8 pi² I.

I is 1.204e-46 kg m².

So 8 pi² is about 78.957.

So denominator is 78.957 * 1.204e-46 = 78.957 * 1.204 = approx 95.1, so 95.1e-46 = 9.51e-45.

So B = (4.39e-67) / (9.51e-45) = 4.39e-67 / 9.51e-45.

4.39e-67 / 9.51e-45 = (4.39/9.51) * 1e-22 = approx 0.461 * 1e-22 = 4.61e-23 J.

That's correct. So E_rot for J=1 is 2B = 9.23e-23 J.

Now, the photon energy is 9.23e-23 J, so p = E/c = 9.23e-23 / 3e8 = approx 3.077e-31 kg m/s, which is 3.077e-31 N s.

But the options are in the 1e-27 to 1e-28 Ns range. So that's way off. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the transition isn't a pure rotational transition. The question says it's switching to the next state with the lowest possible energy, which could involve a combination of rotation and vibration. But that would complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering a vibrational transition, not a rotational one.

Wait, let's compute the photon momentum for the vibrational transition.

ΔE_vib = h w (from 0 to 1), which is 6.626e-34 * 4e14 = 2.65e-19 J.

So p = E/c = 2.65e-19 / 3e8 = 8.83e-28 kg m/s, which is 8.83e-28 Ns. Hmm, that's close to option A, which is 1.9e-28. But not exactly the same.

Wait, perhaps I'm using the wrong formula. Because in the rotational model, the energy difference between J and J+1 is 2B (from J=0 to J=1), but perhaps the question is considering a different model where the energy difference is B?

Wait, no, E_rot(J) is proportional to J(J+1). So the difference between J=0 and J=1 is 2B.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the transition from the ground state (J=0, ν=0) to the first excited state, which might be the first vibrational state (ν=1) with J=0, but that would require a larger energy. Or maybe a transition to a rotational state with J=1 and ν=0.

Wait, but the question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy. So if the energy of the vibrational transition is lower than the rotational, then the photon would be for the vibrational. But from the numbers I calculated, the rotational transition is lower energy. So that's confusing.

Wait, but maybe I messed up the calculation. Let me recompute the rotational energy.

Wait, perhaps the rotational energy isn't intended to be considered here. The question says, the molecule can be modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model. So perhaps the energy levels are a combination of rotational and vibrational, but the fundamental state is the lowest vibrational state (ν=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0). The next state could be either J=1 with ν=0, or ν=1 with J=0. Which one has lower energy.

So we need to compare the energy of these two states.

E1 (J=1, ν=0) = E_rot(1) + E_vib(0) = B * 1*(2) + (1/2) h w.

E2 (ν=1, J=0) = (1/2 h w) + h w * 1 + E_rot(0) = (3/2 h w) + 0.

So E1 = 2B + 0.5 h w.

E2 = 1.5 h w.

So which is smaller, 2B + 0.5 h w or 1.5 h w?

Subtracting, 2B + 0.5 h w equals 1.5 h w when 2B = h w.

So if 2B < h w, then E1 < E2. So the next state is E1. If 2B > h w, then E2 is lower.

So let's compute 2B and h w.

2B = 2 * 4.61e-23 = 9.22e-23 J.

h w = 6.626e-34 * 4e14 = 2.65e-19 J.

Wait, 9.22e-23 J is much less than 2.65e-19 J. So 2B < h w.

So E1 = 2B + 0.5 h w = 9.22e-23 + 0.5 * 2.65e-19 = 9.22e-23 + 1.325e-19 = approx 1.325e-19 J.

E2 =1.5 h w = 1.5 * 2.65e-19 = 3.975e-19 J.

So E1 is lower than E2, so the next state with the lowest energy is E1. So the transition is from (J=0, ν=0) to (J=1, ν=0). So the energy difference is 2B.

So the photon must have energy equal to 2B, which is 9.22e-23 J.

So the photon's momentum p is E/c = 9.22e-23 J / 3e8 m/s ≈ 3.073e-31 kg m/s = 3.073e-31 N s.

But looking at the options, the smallest is 1.4e-28, which is much larger than this. Hmm. So something's wrong here.

Wait, perhaps I've mixed up the energy units or the model.

Wait, maybe the question is considering only vibrational transitions, or perhaps I messed up the model.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the Raman transition or something else, but that's getting complicated.

Alternatively, maybe the photon needs to provide the energy for a vibrational transition. Let me compute the photon momentum for that.

ΔE_vib = h w (1) = 2.65e-19 J.

p = E / c = 2.65e-19 / 3e8 = 8.83e-28 kg m/s = 8.83e-28 Ns.

Looking at the options, option A is 1.9e-28 Ns, option D is 1.4e-28.

Wait, 8.83e-28 is about 4.6 times larger than option A, and about 6.3 times larger than option D. So none match.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of E_vib.

Wait, another possibility: the question is about the transition within the rotational model only, so perhaps the energy level is considering the vibrational and rotational together, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let me think differently. The question is about the fundamental state, which is the lowest energy. The next state may involve a change in either rotation or vibration. But to find the lowest possible energy, we should choose the transition with the smallest energy difference.

Earlier, I found that the rotational transition (ΔE=2B) is much smaller than the vibrational (ΔE=h w). So the rotational transition is the one we need.

But then why are the options so much larger than what I calculated? Did I make a mistake in the value of B?

Wait, let's recalculate B.

Wait, I think I might have made an error in the B calculation.

B is h²/(8 pi² I).

h is 6.626e-34 J s.

h squared is (6.626e-34)^2 = approximately 4.39e-67 J² s².

I is 1.204e-46 kg m².

So denominator: 8 pi² I = 8 * (pi^2) * 1.204e-46.

8 * (pi^2) ≈ 78.96.

So 78.96 * 1.204e-46 ≈ 78.96 *1.204 = around 95.08, so 95.08e-46 = 9.508e-45.

Now, B = 4.39e-67 / 9.508e-45 = (4.39/9.508) * 1e-22 ≈ 0.461 * 1e-22 = 4.61e-23 J.

Wait, so I think that part is correct.

So then, the photon's momentum is E_photon = 2B = 9.22e-23 J.

p = 9.22e-23 / 3e8 = approximately 3.07e-31 Ns. But the options are way larger.

Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the model. Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the vibrational energy, not the rotational. Let me check the values again.

Wait, maybe the question is considering the transition from the ground state to the first vibrational state (ν=1), which requires energy h w. So ΔE = h w = 6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.65e-19 J.

p = 2.65e-19 /3e8 ≈ 8.83e-28 Ns.

But none of the options match this exactly. The closest option is A) 1.9e-28, which is about half of that.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the photon being absorbed in the context of the vibration, but the mass is not correctly handled. Let me think about the vibration part.

The energy levels for vibration are E_vib = (1/2) h w + h w ν.

So the transition from ν=0 to ν=1 requires absorbing a photon of energy h w.

So, E_photon = h w = 6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.65e-19 J.

Then, p = E/c = 2.65e-19 /3e8 = 8.83e-28 kg m/s = 8.83e-28 Ns.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in understanding which transition is being considered.

Wait, perhaps the question is not about the fundamental state but the first excited state in terms of vibration, but the question says the molecule is in the fundamental state.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the energy in terms of the vibrational quantum number. For example, for diatomic molecules, the vibrational energy is quantized, and the first transition is from ν=0 to ν=1, which would require h w.

So the photon's energy is h w, which gives p = h w/(c).

Wait, no, E = h f → E = h (w/(2pi)).

Because f = w/(2pi), so E = h * (w/(2pi)).

So p = E/c = (h w)/(2 pi c).

So let's compute that.

h = 6.626e-34 J s.

w =4e14 rad/s.

c =3e8 m/s.

So E = (6.626e-34 * 4e14) / (2 pi) = (2.65e-19) / (6.283) ≈ 4.21e-20 J.

So p = E/c = 4.21e-20 / 3e8 = 1.403e-28 kg m/s = 1.403e-28 Ns.

Hmm, that's very close to option D: 1.4e-28 Ns.

Wait, so why did I get a different result earlier? Because initially, I thought E_photon is h w, but it's actually E = h (w/(2 pi)), which is h f. Because f = w/(2 pi).

So the correct energy is E = h * (w/(2 pi)).

Yes, that makes sense. So the momentum is (h w)/(2 pi c).

So plugging in the numbers:

h = 6.626e-34 J s.

w =4e14 rad/s.

c =3e8 m/s.

So h*w = 6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.65e-19 J.

Divide by 2 pi: 2.65e-19 / 6.283 ≈ 4.21e-20 J.

Then divide by c: 4.21e-20 / 3e8 = 1.403e-28 kg m/s = 1.403e-28 Ns.

Which matches option D: 1.4e-28 Ns.

So the correct answer must be D.


To determine the momentum of the photon required for the diatomic molecule to transition to the next state with the lowest possible energy, we analyze the energy differences between the fundamental state and the next state. The molecule is modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, and the energy levels involve both rotational and vibrational contributions.

### Key Parameters:
- **Mass of atom X (Mx):** 20 amu  
- **Mass of atom Y (My):** 2 amu  
- **Bond length (R):** 2 Å = \(2 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m}\)  
- **Angular frequency of vibration (\(w\)):** \(4 \times 10^{14} \, \text{rad/s}\)  

### Step 1: Reduced Mass and Moment of Inertia
The reduced mass \(\mu\) is calculated as:
\[
\mu = \frac{Mx \cdot My}{Mx + My} = \frac{20 \cdot 2}{20 + 2} = \frac{40}{22} \approx 1.818 \, \text{amu}.
\]
Converting to kilograms (\(1 \, \text{amu} = 1.6605 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}\)):
\[
\mu \approx 1.818 \times 1.6605 \times 10^{-27} \approx 3.01 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}.
\]

The moment of inertia \(I\) is:
\[
I = \mu R^2 = 3.01 \times 10^{-27} \cdot (2 \times 10^{-10})^2 = 3.01 \times 10^{-27} \cdot 4 \times 10^{-20} = 1.204 \times 10^{-46} \, \text{kg·m}^2.
\]

### Step 2: Rotational Constant
The rotational constant \(B\) is given by:
\[
B = \frac{h^2}{8 \pi^2 I},
\]
where \(h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}\). Substituting the values:
\[
B = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})^2}{8 \pi^2 \cdot 1.204 \times 10^{-46}}.
\]
The numerator is:
\[
(6.626 \times 10^{-34})^2 \approx 4.39 \times 10^{-67} \, \text{J}^2\text{s}^2,
\]
and the denominator is:
\[
8 \pi^2 \cdot 1.204 \times 10^{-46} \approx 9.51 \times 10^{-45}.
\]
Thus:
\[
B \approx \frac{4.39 \times 10^{-67}}{9.51 \times 10^{-45}} \approx 4.61 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}.
\]

### Step 3: Energy Differences
The energy levels for rotation are:
\[
E_{\text{rot}} = B J (J+1),
\]
and for vibration:
\[
E_{\text{vib}} = \frac{1}{2} h w + h w \nu.
\]
The fundamental state corresponds to \(J = 0\) and \(\nu = 0\). The next state with the lowest energy could involve either:
1. A rotational transition (\(J = 1\), \(\nu = 0\)), with energy difference:
\[
\Delta E_{\text{rot}} = E_{\text{rot}}(J=1) - E_{\text{rot}}(J=0) = 2B.
\]
2. A vibrational transition (\(\nu = 1\), \(J = 0\)), with energy difference:
\[
\Delta E_{\text{vib}} = E_{\text{vib}}(\nu=1) - E_{\text{vib}}(\nu=0) = h w.
\]

### Step 4: Comparing Energy Differences
For the rotational transition:
\[
\Delta E_{\text{rot}} = 2B = 2 \cdot 4.61 \times 10^{-23} = 9.22 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}.
\]
For the vibrational transition:
\[
\Delta E_{\text{vib}} = h w = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \cdot 4 \times 10^{14} = 2.65 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}.
\]
Clearly, the rotational transition requires significantly less energy than the vibrational transition. Therefore, the molecule transitions via the rotational pathway.

### Step 5: Photon Momentum
The energy of the photon is equal to the energy difference for the rotational transition:
\[
E_{\text{photon}} = \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = 9.22 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}.
\]
The momentum of the photon is related to its energy by:
\[
p = \frac{E_{\text{photon}}}{c},
\]
where \(c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}\). Substituting:
\[
p = \frac{9.22 \times 10^{-23}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 3.07 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{Ns}.
\]
However, this value is much smaller than the options provided. Reassessing the problem, the vibrational transition is likely intended, as the rotational transition's momentum does not match any of the options. For the vibrational transition:
\[
E_{\text{photon}} = h w = 2.65 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J},
\]
and:
\[
p = \frac{E_{\text{photon}}}{c} = \frac{2.65 \times 10^{-19}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 8.83 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{Ns}.
\]
This value is closest to option **A** but does not match exactly. Recalculating using the vibrational energy difference and considering the angular frequency, the correct momentum is approximately:
\[
p = \frac{h w}{2 \pi c} = \frac{6.626 \times 10^{-34} \cdot 4 \times 10^{14}}{2 \pi \cdot 3 \times 10^8} \approx 1.4 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{Ns}.
\]
This matches option **D**.

### Final Answer:
The photon momentum required for the molecule to transition to the next state with the lowest possible energy is **D**.

Answer: D
