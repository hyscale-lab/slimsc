Okay, so I've got this IUPAC naming question in front of me. Hmm, benzene rings can be a bit tricky, especially when there are multiple substituents. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question says a benzene ring has a carboxylic acid, a carbaldehyde, and a cyano group all meta to one another. That means each of these three groups is separated by one carbon. So if one is in position 1, the others would be in 4 and 7 positions, but wait, benzene is a six-membered ring, so maybe I should think in terms of positions 1,3,5 or similar.

Wait, wait. Let me draw a benzene ring. Let me number the positions clockwise from 1 to 6. So, positions 1, 3, and 5 are meta to each other. So, the substituents—carboxylic acid, carbaldehyde, and cyano—are each at positions 1, 3, and 5. Or maybe another set of meta positions, like 2, 4, 6?

Wait, the question says they are meta to one another. So each pair is meta. So if one is in position 1, the other two would be in positions 3 and 5. But wait, that's three substituents each meta, which is a bit complicated. Alternatively, perhaps they are arranged such that any two are meta, but I'm not sure. Let's see.

But wait, the question also mentions substituents around the carboxylic acid. The carboxylic acid has ortho substituents: a hydroxyl and a dimethyl amino group. Oh, right, so the carboxylic acid is attached to the ring, and in its ortho positions (positions 2 and 6 if the carboxylic is at 1) are the hydroxyl and dimethylamino groups.

Additionally, para to the carboxylic acid is a methoxy group. Para would be position 4 if the carboxylic acid is at position 1.

But wait, what about the relations with the nitrile group (cyano)? The methoxy and the alcohol (hydroxyl) are both ortho to the nitrile. So the nitrile is in a position where its ortho positions are occupied by the hydroxyl and methoxy groups.
