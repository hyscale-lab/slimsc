Okay, so I've got this NMR and LC-MS question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what the question says.

So, the scenario is that I've synthesized a small peptidic compound. When I look at the 1H NMR spectrum of the crude product, everything seems to match what I expect except for two peaks that belong to the same alpha-proton. These two peaks are similar in chemical shift and their integrals add up to 1H. The question also says that spin-spin coupling is ruled out as the cause because the coupling pattern doesn't fit that. 

Then, the LC-MS analysis at elevated temperature shows two peaks of equal intensity. Both have the same mass spectrum, which matches the expected molecule. Hmm.

Wait, so why are there two peaks in NMR and LC-MS? But in the LC-MS, both are same mass. So it's not like they're different compounds because the mass is the same. So maybe it's something else.

Let me think about the options. The options are A, B, C, D.

Option A: Contaminated with a precursor. So a precursor would have a different mass, right? Because it's the starting material before a reaction happened. If the crude compound's LC-MS shows two peaks with same mass, probably not a precursor. Because the precursor should have a higher mass. So I can probably rule out option A.

Option B: Mixture of enantiomers. Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images. In NMR, when you have enantiomers, the NMR spectrum usually looks like a single peak because the protons are in the same environment. Unless it's a chiral column or something, but in regular NMR, enantiomers would average out. Or wait, wait. Wait, in some cases, if the compound is impure and has some enantiomers, the NMR might show splitting? Or maybe if the environment is chiral, but in a regular spectrum, maybe not. Also, in LC-MS, enantiomers would elute at the same time because the column doesn't distinguish them. So if the LC-MS shows two peaks of same mass, enantiomers wouldn't cause that. Hmm, not sure about this one.

Option C: 'Double coupling' during amide bond formation. Double coupling usually refers to when a proton is coupled to two different sets of equivalent protons, leading to a more complex splitting. But the question says the coupling pattern rules out spin-spin coupling as the reason. So maybe this isn't the case. Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Wait, double coupling can cause multiple peaks for the same proton. But if the coupling is not spin-spin, maybe it's something else. Alternatively, maybe the synthesis went wrong and created another structure, but that doesn't seem to fit with the LC-MS.

Option D: Mixture of diastereoisomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties, so they would have different NMR spectra. But wait, the NMR in the question has two peaks for the same alpha-proton, same shift, but the coupling isn't spin-spin. Also, diastereomers would typically have different mass, but wait in this case, the LC-MS shows same mass. Oh, but if the diastereomers have the same molecular formula, like perhaps in the case of epimers or something else. Wait, no, diastereomers must have different physical properties, so their mass would be the same. So if diastereomers are present, their NMR would have different chemical shifts. But in the question, the two peaks are for the same alpha-proton, same shift? That doesn't make sense. Or wait, could it be a situation like axial and equatorial protons in a cyclohexane ring? But in that case, the protons would have different shifts. But the question says the two peaks have similar shifts. Hmm, that's confusing.

Wait, but the NMR shows two peaks for the same alpha-proton. And their integrals add up to
