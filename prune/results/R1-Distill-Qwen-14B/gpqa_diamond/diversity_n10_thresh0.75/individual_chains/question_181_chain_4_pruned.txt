Okay, so I have this question about neutrinos from the Sun and their flux ratios. Hmm, let me try to think through this. I remember that neutrinos are produced in the Sun's core, right? And there are different processes that produce them. The question is about the pp-III branch stopping. Wait, what's the pp-III branch?

Oh, right! The proton-proton chain is the main way the Sun produces energy. There are different branches. The pp-I branch is the main part where two protons collide and form deuterium, releasing a positron and a neutrino. Then there's the pp-II branch, which maybe involves more steps, and pp-III... I'm a bit hazy on that. Oh wait, pp-III probably refers to a specific reaction step, maybe where a boron-8 nucleus is involved. Because I remember that boron-8 is a major source of neutrinos too.

So, if the pp-III branch suddenly stops, what does that mean for neutrino production? Well, the pp-III branch contributes a certain amount of neutrinos. If it stops, that part of the flux would drop. But other reactions are still happening. Wait, but the question says all other reactions remained as they were. So only the pp-III branch is stopped.

Wait, wait a second. The pp-III branch is part of the proton-proton chain, so if it stops, does that affect the overall fusion? Or is the pp chain just a part of the reactions? I think the pp chain is the dominant process in the Sun's core, so if a
