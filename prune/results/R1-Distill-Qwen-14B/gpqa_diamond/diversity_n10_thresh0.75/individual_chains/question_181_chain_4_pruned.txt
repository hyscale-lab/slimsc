Okay, so I've got this question about neutrinos and the Sun's reactions. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says that the pp-III branch suddenly stopped in the Sun's core about 8.5 minutes ago. Wait, 8.5 minutes is the approximate time it takes for light to travel from the Sun's core to Earth, right? Because the Sun's radius is about 700,000 km, and light travels at about 300,000 km/s. So 700,000 / (3 * 1e5) = roughly 233 seconds, which is about 3.88 minutes. Wait, wait, no, wait. Let me calculate that again. 700,000 km divided by 3e5 km/s is 700,000 / 3e5 = 2.333... minutes. Oh, right, around 2.3 minutes. So 8.5 minutes would mean the neutrinos have had more time to reach us. Hmm, I'm a bit confused there. Maybe the question just says 8.5 minutes ago, so the neutrinos would have been unaffected and already on their way when the pp-III branch stopped.

Wait, but neutrinos are produced in the Sun's core, right? And the pp-III reactions are part of the proton-proton chain, which is the main source of solar energy. So the pp-III branch produces neutrinos. Oh, right, the pp-I and pp-II are other branches, but the question is stopping the pp-III specifically. So if the pp-III branch stops, what happens to the neutrino flux?

The question is about the flux ratio between two energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). So, I need to figure out how the pp-III branch's neutrinos contribute to these energy bands.

I remember that the main neutrino emission from the Sun comes from the decay of beryllium-7, which happens in the pp-III branch. The process is something like: in the pp-III branch, protons (after some steps) combine with carbon-12 to form nitrogen-14, which then captures a proton to become carbon-13, and then this carbon-13 emits a neutrino and becomes nitrogen-
