Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with NMR and reaction mechanisms, but I'll try to tackle it step by step.

Alright, the problem says that a compound with the molecular formula C8H9NO is reacted with a series of reagents, and we need to find out what the final product is. The options are A to D, each a different aldehyde or something similar.

First, let's look at the NMR data given. The 1H-NMR shows:

- 9.72 ppm: a triplet, 1H. That's probably an aldehyde proton because aldehydes typically show up around 9-10 ppm. So maybe this compound has an aldehyde group.

- 6.98 ppm: a doublet, 2H. Aromatic protons, maybe from a para-substituted benzene ring. If it's a doublet, perhaps it's part of a substituent where the two protons are equivalent and each is split by one neighboring proton.

- 6.51 ppm: another doublet, 2H. Also aromatic. Maybe another benzene ring that's ortho or para to substituents.

- 6.27 ppm: a broad singlet, 2H. Hmm, broad singlet. Could be protons next to an oxygen, like maybe a methine (CH) group attached to an oxygen, or perhaps adjacent to a substituent that causes broadening. Alternatively, it might be an aromatic ring with substituents that cause the protons to be deshielded but not split into a doublet. Wait, but it's a singlet, so maybe it's a -CH2- group next to an oxygen? Or perhaps a di-substituted aromatic ring where the protons are not split much.

- 3.66 ppm: a doublet, 2H. This seems like a CH2 group adjacent to an electronegative atom, maybe oxygen. So maybe a -OCH2- group or something like that.

Putting the NMR together: Let's see. If there's an aldehyde (from 9.72), then some aromatic rings. The 6.98 and 6.51 ppm signals are likely two different aromatic environments. Maybe it's a disubstituted benzene. Wait, but 2H for each? So perhaps each is a pair of equivalent protons, like in a para-substituted ring. So maybe two benzene rings are present, each with substituents.

Wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation to see what's going on.

Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Wait, for a formula like C8H9NO:

C=8, H=9, N=1, O=1. So DoU = (2*8 + 2 - 9 - 0 +1)/2 → (18 -9 +1)/2 → (10)/2 =5.

So five degrees of unsaturation. That could be, for example, one ring and two double bonds, or one ring, one double bond, and another ring. Or maybe something else. Let's think: Benzene has three DoU (three double bonds), and the rest could be an aldehyde (one DoU, as a double bond) and a ring or another double bond.

Wait, the aldehyde group is a carbonyl, which is a double bond. So that's one. Then a benzene ring (three) gives total four. The remaining one could be another ring (like a five-membered ring) or another double bond. Or, perhaps the compound has a bicyclic structure.

Alternatively, maybe the molecule has two benzene rings and an aldehyde group. Let's see: two benzene rings would account for 6 DoU (each benzene is 3), but wait, wait no, two benzene rings are two times three, which is 6. But the formula only gives 5 DoU. Hmm, so that can't be. So perhaps only one benzene ring, and the rest are other structures.

Wait, alternative approach: Maybe the compound has a benzene ring and another ring, perhaps a cyclopropane? Or maybe a benzene ring, an aldehyde group, and another double bond somewhere else. Let's see.

Wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's consider the structure. The aldehyde group is -CHO (which is O). So that's accounted for. Then, perhaps a benzene ring (C6H5-) attached to something else. The rest would be C2H4N. Hmm, that's not making much sense.

Wait, perhaps the structure is something like a benzaldehyde derivative with substituents. Let me think: Benzaldehyde is C7H6O. But our compound is C8H9NO, so one more carbon, three more hydrogens, and a nitrogen. Maybe the substituent is a group like -CH2-NO or something else.

Wait, the NMR has a peak at 3.66 ppm, which might be a -OCH2- group. So maybe it's a structure where the benzaldehyde is connected to an oxygenated group, like an ether or ester, which has a CH2 next to oxygen.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is a coumarin derivative or something else with a conjugated system.

Wait, let's think about the NMR again. The triplet at 9.72 is probably an aldehyde. The doublets at 6.98 and 6.51 for 2H each suggest two sets of equivalent aromatic protons. Maybe it's a 1,4-disubstituted benzene (para) with substituents in the para positions.
