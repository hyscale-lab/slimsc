Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about elastic scattering of electrons from a nuclear target. Hmm, the question gives me some phase shifts and asks for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. Let me think about how to approach this.

I remember that in scattering theory, especially in nuclear physics, the scattering amplitude is often expressed in terms of partial waves. Each partial wave is associated with a phase shift, and the amplitude has both real and imaginary parts. Wait, right, the scattering amplitude f(θ) can be written as a sum over all these partial waves.

The general formula for the scattering amplitude f(θ) is a sum from l=0 to some maximum L of ( (2l+1) / (2ik) ) * ( sin(δ_l - π l/2) ) * e^{iδ_l} ), or something like that. Oh wait, or is it the other way around? I think it's more precise to recall that the amplitude f is given by a sum over l of ( (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l ) / (k R (1 + cosθ)) ), but I'm not entirely sure. Wait, perhaps it's better to think about the partial wave expansion.

Alternatively, I remember that the scattering amplitude can be expressed using the partial waves. For each orbital angular momentum l, there's a contribution. The formula I think is:

f(θ) = (1/k) * Σ [ (2l + 1) e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l P_l(cosθ) ]

Wait, but
