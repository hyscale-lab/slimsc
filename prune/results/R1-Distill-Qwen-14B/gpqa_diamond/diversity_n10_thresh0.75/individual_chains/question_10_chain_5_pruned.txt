Okay, so I have this question about exoplanets and their densities. Hmm, let me think about it. The question is asking which exoplanet among the options has the highest density. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I remember that density relates to mass and volume, right?

So, density is mass divided by volume. The formula is ρ = m/V. So for each option, I need to figure out the density based on their mass and radius, since volume depends on radius.

Looking at the options:

Option a) is an Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet. So Earth's density is about 5.5 g/cm³, which I know because Earth is made mostly of rock and metal, similar to how we learned about planets. So option a's density is 5.5.

Option b) says a planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³. Wait, but wait, that's already giving the density. So if the density is 5.5, same as Earth, but it's more massive. But regardless, the density is same as Earth. So perhaps this planet is similar in composition to Earth, but I'm not sure. Wait, the question is about which has the highest density, so maybe this is a contender.

Option c) is a planet with the same composition as Earth but five times more massive. Oh, same composition as Earth. So if Earth's composition is, say, rock and metal, then this planet is made of the same stuff. But since it's more massive, what does that do to its density? Well, if it's same composition, then the density should be the same as Earth. Because density is a function of material composition, right? So if it's same material, density is same. So its density would be 5.5 g/cm³. So same as a and b.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. No, wait. If the planet has the same composition as Earth but more mass, how does that affect density? Oh, wait, no, because density is determined by the material, not the size. So if two objects are made of same stuff, their densities are same regardless of mass. So for example, a small rock and a big rock of same material have same density. So option c's density is same as Earth, which is 5.5.

Option d) is a planet with same composition as Earth but half the mass. Again, same composition
