Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about Grubbs catalyst and racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Hmm, I remember that Grubbs is used for olefin metathesis reactions. Let me try to think this through.

Wait, Grubbs catalyst is a transition metal catalyst, right? It's used in olefin metathesis, which is a reaction where alkenes (olefins) undergo redistribution of their substituents. So, when Grubbs is involved, the double bonds can break and re-form, leading to different products.

The starting material is racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Racemic means it's a 50-50 mixture of enantiomers. So, the molecule has a chiral center somewhere. Let me draw the structure to visualize it better.

3-methylpent-1-ene would have the double bond between C1 and C2. The structure would be CH2=CH-C(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Wait, no, pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3, but with a methyl branch on the third carbon. So, it's CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3? No, wait. Wait, pent has five carbons. Let's count.

Wait, pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. So 3-methyl would be a methyl group on carbon 3. So carbon 1 is CH2, carbon 2 is CH-, carbon 3 is CH(CH3), and then carbon
