Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it. Let's read the question carefully.

We have 10,000 identical systems, each with a particle moving along a tube (x-axis). The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. When they measured the position, all particles were found between x=1 and x=3. So, the wave function must be zero outside this region, specifically for x < 1 and x > 3. The question is asking for the value of 'a'.

Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the wave function must be normalizable. That means the integral of the absolute square of the wave function over all space must equal 1. Also, the wave function must be zero where the particle isn't found. So here, the wave function is zero when x <1 and x>3, implying that the wave function is non-zero only between 1 and 3.

The given wave function is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Wait, but wave functions are typically complex, but the modulus squared is what we integrate. The modulus squared is the product of the wave function and its complex conjugate.

Wait, but for a wave function ψ(x), the integral from x=-infinite to x=infinite of |ψ(x)|² dx must equal 1. In this case, the wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Let me see the form here.

So, ψ(x) = (a/sqrt(1+x)) ) - 0.5i. Wait, but that would make the wave function a combination of a real term and an imaginary term. But that might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps there's a typo, or maybe I'm misinterpreting it. Wait, maybe the entire expression is the numerator, like (a / sqrt(1+x)) minus (0.5i), but that would make it a complex function. Alternatively, perhaps the wave function is (a / sqrt(1+x)) multiplied by some complex factor, but perhaps I should proceed.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i, meaning it's a sum of a real and an imaginary part. But when we take the modulus squared, the cross terms (like the product of the real and imaginary parts) might contribute. Hmm, but perhaps the given wave function is ψ(x) = a/(sqrt(1+x)) multiplied by (1 - 0.5i). Wait, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the given wave function is a/(sqrt(1+x)) multiplied by some exponential or other function, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps it's better to write it as ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1+x)) * (1 - 0.5i). Because then it's easier to compute the modulus squared.

But wait, the way the question is written, it's (a / sqrt(1 + x)) minus 0.5i. So, ψ(x) = [a/(sqrt(1+x))] - 0.5i. So the real part is a/(sqrt(1+x)), and the imaginary part is -0.5. That's interesting because the imaginary part is a constant, which is unusual. But perhaps that's correct.

Wait, but in reality, for a valid wave function, the integral of |ψ|² must be 1. Let's compute |ψ(x)|².

So, ψ(x) = A - B i, where A is a/(sqrt(1+x)), and B is 0.5. So the modulus squared would be (A)^2 + (B)^2, right? Because for any complex number a + bi, the modulus squared is a² + b².

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the modulus squared is (a - b i)(a + b i) = a² + b². So, yes, that's correct.

So, |ψ(x)|² = [a²/(1+x)] + (0.5)^2.

So, the integral from x=1 to x=3 of |ψ(x)|² dx must equal 1.

Wait, but wait, the wave function is zero outside x=1 and x=3, so the integral over the entire x is just the integral from 1 to 3.

So, the normalization condition is:

Integral from x=1 to x=3 of [ (a²)/(1+x) + (0.5)^2 ) ] dx = 1.

Hmm, but wait, does this make sense? Because the wave function is zero outside 1-3, and non-zero inside. So the integral must be 1. So, let's write that.

The integral of [ a²/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx from 1 to 3.

Let me compute each part separately.

First, the integral of a²/(1+x) dx from 1 to 3. The integral of 1/(1+x) dx is ln|1+x|, so between 1 and 3, that's ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(4/2) = ln(2). So the first term is a² * ln(2).

The second part is the integral of 0.25 dx from 1 to 3. That's 0.25*(3-1) )= 0.25*2= 0.5.

So the total is a² * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So:

a² * ln(2) = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5.

So a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

Compute 0.5 divided by ln(2). Let me think. Ln(2) is approximately 0.6931.

So 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

So a² ≈ 0.7213. Then a is the square root of that: sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.85, option D is 0.6.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me make sure I did everything correctly.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the wave function expression. The wave function given is (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So is that a real term plus a purely imaginary term?

In that case, the modulus squared is (a^2)/(1+x) + (0.5)^2. Because (a - i 0.5)(a + i 0.5) = a² + (0.5)^2.

Wait, but that would make the modulus squared a sum of two terms. So the integral of [ a²/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx from 1 to 3 equals 1.

Which is what I did earlier. So that seems correct.

So a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1. Then a² ln(2) = 0.5. So a² = 0.5 / ln(2) ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

a≈ sqrt(0.7213)= about 0.849, so 0.85 is option B.

Wait, but wait, another point. The wave function must satisfy the Schrödinger equation and be square-integrable, but perhaps I should check if the wave function as given is valid in this region.

Wait, the wave function given is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. But for a stationary state, the wave function is usually expressed as a product of a spatial part and a time-dependent exponential, like e^{-iEt/ħ}. But in this problem, perhaps the time dependence is ignored, or the given wave function is the spatial part multiplied by some exponential. Alternatively, perhaps the given expression is just the spatial part, and the exponential part is omitted.

Hmm, but for normalization, we only care about the modulus squared, so perhaps that's not an issue.

Wait, but wait another thing. The wave function is given as (a/sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i. That's a function that's a sum of a real and an imaginary term. Does this form make sense in terms of being a solution to the Schrödinger equation?

Because typically, the time-independent Schrödinger equation for a particle in a potential would lead to solutions that are purely real or purely imaginary, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the wave function is being written in a form that includes a constant imaginary component.

But perhaps that's beyond the scope of the current problem, which is just about normalization. So I'll proceed with the calculation as before.

So, a≈0.849, so the closest option is B) 0.85.

Wait, but let me compute it more accurately. Let me compute 0.5 / ln(2).

ln(2) is approximately 0.69314718056.

0.5 / 0.69314718056 ≈ 0.72134752044.

So a²=0.72134752044.

a= sqrt(0.72134752044) ≈ 0.8493.

Which is approximately 0.85, so option B.


To solve the problem, we start by noting that the wave function is given as:

\[
\psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i
\]

The wave function must satisfy the normalization condition, which requires that the integral of \(|\psi(x)|^2\) over all space equals 1. Since the wave function is zero outside the region \(1 \leq x \leq 3\), the normalization integral is:

\[
\int_1^3 |\psi(x)|^2 dx = 1
\]

The modulus squared of the wave function is:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25
\]

Substituting this into the integral:

\[
\int_1^3 \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1
\]

We split the integral into two parts:

1. \(\int_1^3 \frac{a^2}{1+x} dx\)  
   The integral of \(\frac{1}{1+x}\) is \(\ln|1+x|\). Evaluating this from \(x=1\) to \(x=3\):

   \[
   \int_1^3 \frac{a^2}{1+x} dx = a^2 \left[\ln(4) - \ln(2)\right] = a^2 \ln(2)
   \]

2. \(\int_1^3 0.25 dx\)  
   This is straightforward:

   \[
   \int_1^3 0.25 dx = 0.25 \cdot (3-1) = 0.5
   \]

Adding these results, the normalization condition becomes:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1
\]

Rearranging for \(a^2\):

\[
a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}
\]

Using \(\ln(2) \approx 0.6931\):

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7213
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
a \approx \sqrt{0.7213} \approx 0.849
\]

The closest option to this value is \(a = 0.85\), which corresponds to option **B**.

Answer: B
