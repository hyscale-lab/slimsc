Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because cycloadditions can be tricky. But let's take it step by step.

The question is about a [4+2] cycloaddition reaction between 2,5-dimethylthiophene and furan-2,5-dione when heated. I need to find the exo product from the options given.

First, I remember that a [4+2] cycloaddition is a Diels-Alder reaction. Wait, no, waitâ€”Diels-Alder is a specific type of [4+2] cycloaddition between a diene and a dienophile. So in this case, I need to figure out which molecule is the diene and which is the dienophile.

Furan-2,5-dione is a dienophile because it's a good electron-deficient molecule. The structure of furan-2,5-dione is a furan ring with two ketone groups at positions 2 and 5. That makes it a good dienophile because the electron-withdrawing groups (the ketones) activate it for the reaction.

2,5-dimethylthiophene, on the other hand, is a conjugated diene. Thiophene is an aromatic five-membered ring with one sulfur. The 2,5-dimethyl groups are probably the substituents on the ring. Since thiophene is aromatic, but when it's in a conjugated diene form, it can act as a diene in the Diels-Alder reaction. Wait, but thiophene's structure is such that it's a five-membered ring with two double bonds. For a Diels-Alder, the diene needs to be conjugated. So the thiophene must be in a position to act as the diene.

Wait, wait a second. Thiophene itself is aromatic, but if it's a diene, maybe it's not the aromatic structure anymore. Or perhaps it's acting as a diene in a non-aromatic form? No, I think in the Diels-Alder reaction, the diene is typically a conjugated diene, which can be either electron-rich. Thiophene is electron-rich because of the sulfur atom, but when it's in a non-aromatic form, like in a s-cis conformation, can it
