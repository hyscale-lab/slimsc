Okay, so I've got this question about stars and parallax. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to the distance of a star. Oh right, parallax is the apparent shift in position of a star due to the Earth's movement around the Sun. The formula I remember is that distance (d) in parsecs is the reciprocal of parallax (plx), so d = 1/plx. 

Wait, the question is about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with plx. So if I have a range of parallax values, like from plx to plx + dplx, how many stars are in that range?

Assuming stars are uniformly distributed in the sky, that probably means that the number density of stars doesn't depend on direction but depends on distance. So if the stars are uniformly spread out, the number of stars you'd expect in a certain volume depends on the volume of that region.

But wait, wait—parallax is inversely proportional to distance. So a higher parallax means a closer star, and a lower parallax means a more distant star. So if I consider a small change in parallax, dplx, what does that mean for the corresponding change in distance?

Let me think about the relationship between d and plx. Since d = 1/plx, then a change in plx would relate to a change in d. Let's express d in terms of plx. So plx is p, then d = 1/p.

Taking the differential, dd = -1/p² dp. Hmm, but I'm not sure if I need calculus here. Maybe I can think in terms of ranges.

Suppose I have a range of plx from p to p + Δp. What is the corresponding range in distance? The distance at p is d = 1/p. The distance at p + Δp is approximately d + Δd = 1/(p + Δp). Using a Taylor expansion for large p (since small Δp compared to p), 1/(p + Δp) ≈ (1/p) - (Δp)/p². So Δd ≈ -Δp / p².

Wait, but for the volume, I think it's a spherical shell with radius d and thickness dd. The volume of a spherical shell is 4πd² dd. So the number of stars in that shell would be the volume multiplied by the number density of stars (n), assuming uniform distribution.

So number of stars N = n * 4π d² dd. But wait, the question is about number per unit range of plx. So for a given Δp, how does N depend on p?

We know that d = 1/p → dd = -1/p² dp. So substituting d and dd:

N = n * 4π (1/p²)² * ( -1/p² dp )

Wait, wait, let me get that right. d is 1/p, so d² is (1/p)^2 = 1/p². And dd is -1/p² dp. So substituting:

N = n * 4π * (1/p²) * (-1/p²) dp )

Wait, that's 4π n (1/p^4) (-dp). But the negative sign just indicates direction, but since we're dealing with ranges, we can take the absolute value. So N is proportional to 1/p^4. So the number of stars per unit plx range (Δp) is proportional to 1/p^4.

Wait, but the options have different exponents. Let me check the options again. The options are A) 1/p^4, B) 1/p², C) 1/p, D) 1/p^3.

So according to this, the number of stars per unit plx range decreases as p^4. So the correct option would be A.

But wait, is there a different approach? Another way to think about it: the number of stars per unit volume is uniform. So if I consider a thin shell between distance d and d+dd, the volume is 4πd² dd. The number of stars in that shell is n * 4πd² dd.

But since d = 1/p, then dd = -1/p² dp. So substituting d and dd:

N = n * 4π (1/p²) * (-1/p²) dp = n * (-4π) (1/p^4) dp.

Again, taking the absolute value, it's proportional to (1/p^4) dp. So for each unit of p, the number of stars is proportional to 1/p^4. So the number per unit plx range (dp) goes like 1/p^4.

Wait, but the question is phrased as 'number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx)'. So it's N per Δp. So yes, that would be proportional to 1/p^4. So the correct answer is A.


To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we start by noting that parallax \( p \) is inversely proportional to distance \( d \), such that \( d = \frac{1}{p} \). Assuming stars are uniformly distributed in space, the number of stars in a thin spherical shell of radius \( d \) and thickness \( dd \) is proportional to the volume of the shell, which is \( 4\pi d^2 dd \).

The relationship between \( dd \) and \( dp \) is derived from \( d = \frac{1}{p} \), giving \( dd = -\frac{1}{p^2} dp \). Substituting \( d = \frac{1}{p} \) and \( dd = -\frac{1}{p^2} dp \) into the volume expression, the number of stars \( N \) in the shell becomes proportional to:

\[
N \propto 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{p^2}\right) \left(-\frac{1}{p^2} dp\right) \propto \frac{1}{p^4} dp.
\]

This shows that the number of stars per unit range of parallax (\( \Delta p \)) decreases as \( \frac{1}{p^4} \). Among the given options, this corresponds to:

**A) \( \sim \frac{1}{p^4} \)**.
