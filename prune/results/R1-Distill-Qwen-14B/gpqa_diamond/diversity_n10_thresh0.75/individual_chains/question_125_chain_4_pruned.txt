Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let's see what the question is about. 

The problem says: We have a particle of mass m moving in an isotropic three-dimensional potential V(r) = ½ m ω² r². So this is a harmonic oscillator in three dimensions, right? And the question is about the energy of the third excited state and how many linearly independent eigenfunctions correspond to that energy.

Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the energy levels of a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator are quantized. Each energy level depends on the sum of the quantum numbers in each direction. Since it's isotropic, all three directions (x, y, z) are the same, so the potential is symmetric.

Wait, the energy levels for 3D harmonic oscillator are given by E_n = (n + 3/2) ħω, where n is the sum of the quantum numbers in each direction. But wait, no, each direction has its own quantum number. Let me think again. For each direction, the energy is (n_i + ½) ħω, where n_i is 0,1,2,... So in three dimensions, the total energy is the sum for each axis: E = (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) ħω. 

Alternatively, I've heard that the energy levels are determined by the principal quantum number N, where N = n_x + n_y + n_z. So E = (N + 3/2) ħω.

Now, the question is about the third excited state. Wait, what defines the ground state and excited states here? The ground state is the lowest energy, which corresponds to N=0 (n_x = n_y = n_z =0). The first excited state would be the next level, which is N=1. Then the second excited state is N=2, third is N=3. So the third excited state is when N=3.

So the energy should be E = (3 + 3/2) ħω = (9/2) ħω. That's 4.5 ħω. Looking at the options, option A and C have (9/2) ħω. So the energy part is either A or C.

Wait, the second part of the question is about the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for the same energy eigenvalue. That is, for a
