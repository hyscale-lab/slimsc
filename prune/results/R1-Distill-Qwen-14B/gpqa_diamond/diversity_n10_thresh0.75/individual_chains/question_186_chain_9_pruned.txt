Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about the Cope rearrangement, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's start by understanding what the question is asking.

The compound given is (1S,4R)-2-vinyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene. I need to find out what product forms when it undergoes a Cope rearrangement. The options are four different cyclopentapyridines with varying substituents and hydrogen placements.

First, I should recall what the Cope rearrangement is. From what I remember, the Cope rearrangement is a [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement that typically occurs in 1,5-dienes. The reaction forms a new six-membered ring, often a bicyclic structure if the starting material is already bicyclic.

So, the starting material is 2-vinyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene. Let me visualize that structure. Bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene has two rings: a bridge with two carbons, another with two, and one with one, making it a norbornene structure. The numbering might help. The azabicyclo part means there's a nitrogen in the ring. The substituent is a vinyl group at position 2.

Wait, the structure is 2-vinyl, so the vinyl is attached to the same carbon as the nitrogen? Or is it on a different carbon? Let me sketch this mentally. The bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene would have two bridgeheads. The numbering: position 1 is one bridgehead, position 4 is another. So, the molecule has a bridge between 1 and 2, another between 2 and 3, and a single bridge between 3 and 1? Hmm, maybe I should think of norbornene, which is bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene, but here it's hept-5-ene. So the double bond is at position 5, which would be between carbons 5 and 6 perhaps.

But wait, perhaps the structure is more accurately represented as a bicyclo with the double bond in a different position. Alternatively, I should look up the structure of 2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene. Oh wait, I can't look it up right now, so I'll have to proceed with what I know.

So, the molecule has a bridge, and a vinyl group attached to the nitrogen (since it's 2-azabicyclo). The Cope rearrangement requires a 1,5-diene system. So in the molecule, the diene part should be arranged in a way that there are conjugated double bonds separated by three single bonds.

Wait, but 2-vinyl would have a double bond. So the vinyl group is CH₂=CH– attached to the nitrogen. So the structure has a
