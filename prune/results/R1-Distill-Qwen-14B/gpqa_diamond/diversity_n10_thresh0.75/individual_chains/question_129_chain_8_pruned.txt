Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem is about a series of reactions starting from compound A and going through several steps to form compounds B, C, D, and finally E. I need to identify what E is based on the given information and the hints.

So, the reaction steps are:

1. A reacts with HCN to form B.
2. B is reduced with H2 in the presence of Pd to form C.
3. C reacts with HNO2 to form D.
4. D loses an inert gas to form E.

The hints are:
a) When A reacts with an unknown phosphorous ylide, it forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane.
b) IR of A has a peak at ~1750 cm^-1, and E's IR is ~1715 cm^-1.

The options given are four different cyclic ketones.

Let me start by breaking down each reaction and the possible structures.

First, the IR data: 1750 cm^-1 is a strong peak, which usually indicates a carbonyl group (C=O). So A has a ketone or maybe an ester or another carbonyl-containing group. Then, E has a peak at 1715, which is a bit lower, so maybe a different carbonyl environment—like a ketone in a cyclic structure. So E is a ketone, probably.

Looking at the reaction steps:

1. A + HCN → B.

HCN adds to carbonyl groups. So if A is a ketone, reacting with HCN would form a cyanohydrin. Wait, but wait: HCN adds to ketones to form cyanohydrins, which have an alcohol and a cyanide group attached. So B would have an -OH and a -CN group adjacent to each other.

But wait, another possibility: if A is an aldehyde, but the IR suggests a ketone (since aldehydes typically have higher C=O stretches around 1720-1740, but 1750 is more like an ester or a ketone maybe). Hmm, but wait, wait—wait, wait. Let's think again. In ketones, the C=O stretch is typically around 1700-1750 cm^-1. Esters and aldehydes are higher, like 1720-1760. So 1750 could be an ester or maybe a conjugated ketone.

But the reaction with HCN—assuming A is a ketone. So A is a ketone. Then, upon reaction with HCN, it forms a cyanohydrin, which would have an alcohol and a nitrile group adjacent.

So, B is a secondary alcohol with a nitrile group attached.

Then, step 2: B is reduced with H2 and Pd. What's that do?

Wait, H2 and Pd is typically a hydrogenation catalyst. So looking at B, which has a n
