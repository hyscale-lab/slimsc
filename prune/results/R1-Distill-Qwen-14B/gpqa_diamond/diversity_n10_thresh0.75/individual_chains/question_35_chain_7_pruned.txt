Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Hmm, let me think. I remember that angular momentum operators involve spin matrices, and eigenvalues would relate to their possible values.

The problem says that the operator A_y is represented by a 2x2 matrix A_y = c·S, where c is h/(4π) and S is a given matrix. The matrix S has the first row (0, -i) and the second row (i, 0). So I should probably write that out. Let me see, S is:

[ 0  -i ]
[ i   0 ]

And c is h/(4π). So A_y would be (h/(4π)) multiplied by this matrix S.

Wait, but wait. Angular momentum operators usually have units of ħ, right? Oh, because c is h/(4π), which is the same as ħ/2 because ħ is h/(2π). So wait, c would be (h/(2π)) * (1/2) ) = ħ/2? Wait, let me compute that. Because h/(4π) is (1/(2π)) * (h/(2π)) )? Wait, no. Wait, h/(4π) is equal to (h/(2π)) * (1/2) = ħ * (1/2), because ħ is h/(2π). So c is ħ/2.

So then, A_y = (ħ/2) * S. So the matrix for A_y is (ħ/2) multiplied by S.

But wait, the matrix S is given as [[0, -i],[i, 0]]. So when I multiply by c, it becomes [[0, -(i)(ħ/2)], [i(ħ/2), 0]]. So the matrix A_y is:

[ 0           -(iħ/2) ]
[ (iħ/2)      0       ]

Now, I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of this matrix.

The eigenvalues are found by solving the characteristic equation det(A_y - aI) = 0.

Let me write the matrix (A_y - a I):

[ -a      -(iħ/2)   ]
[ (iħ/2)  -a       ]

The determinant is (-a)(-a
