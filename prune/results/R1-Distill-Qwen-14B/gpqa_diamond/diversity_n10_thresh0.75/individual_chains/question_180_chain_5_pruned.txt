Okay, so I have this physics problem to solve, and I'm a bit rusty on my electrostatics, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says we have an isolated system of 13 identical particles. Each has a charge of 2e. Oh wait, e is the elementary charge, right? So each has 2 times that. The mass is negligible, so I don't have to worry about any kinetic energy or anything like that. 

So out of these 13 charges, 12 are constrained to stay at a distance of 2 meters from a point P. And the 13th charge is fixed at point P. The question is asking for the minimum energy of this system. Hmm, I think it's the electrostatic potential energy. Because when you have charges in a system, their potential energy depends on their positions, and the energy is minimized when the system is in the most stable configuration.

Wait, but why would the energy be minimum here? I'm not entirely sure, but I think since the other 12 charges are fixed at 2 meters from P, their positions are set. The charge at P is fixed, so all the other charges are just at that 2-meter distance. So the system's potential energy would be due to all the interactions between these charges.

Electrostatic potential energy between two point charges is given by Coulomb's law formula: U = k * (q1 * q2) / r, where k is Coulomb's constant, approximately 8.988 x 10^9 N·m²/C². 

But wait, when you have multiple charges, how do you calculate the total potential energy? Oh right, the potential energy of a system of multiple charges is the sum of the potential energies of each pair. So for each pair of charges, you calculate their contribution and add them up.

In this case, there are 13 charges in total. Let's break it down. The 13th charge is at P, and the other 12 are at 2 meters from P. So each of these 12 interacts with the one at P. Also, each of the 12 charges at 2 meters will interact with each other. So we have two contributions: 

1. The energy between each of the 12 charges and the charge at P.
2. The energy between each pair of the 12 charges.
