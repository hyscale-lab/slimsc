Okay, so I've got this question about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

Alright, the problem states that it's a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass m and maximum amplitude A. It's obeying Hooke's law, which is F = -kx. The question is about finding the maximum speed, v_max, of the mass. And they give four options, all involving c, the speed of light, so relativistic effects are definitely in play here.

Wait, in a regular, non-relativistic harmonic oscillator, the maximum speed is given by v_max = sqrt(kA/m), right? Because the potential energy at maximum displacement (A) converts to kinetic energy at the equilibrium point. So the maximum speed would be when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic. But since this is relativistic, I can't use that formula directly because relativistic effects change the equations of motion and energy.

Hmm, relativistic considerations... So, in relativity, the kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv², it's (gamma - 1)mc², where gamma is the Lorentz factor, gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So the total energy in a relativistic oscillator must account for that.

Wait, but what about the potential energy here? In the relativistic case, does the potential energy still behave the same as in the classical case? Hmm, I think in the harmonic oscillator, the potential is still (1/2)kx², which is non-relativistic, but the kinetic energy part is relativistic.

So at the maximum amplitude A, all the energy is potential: U = (1/2)kA². As the mass moves towards the equilibrium, this potential energy converts into kinetic energy. But since we're in relativity, the total energy E is the sum of rest mass energy and kinetic energy. So E = mc² + K, where K is the kinetic energy.

Wait, no, actually, the total mechanical energy should still be conserved, but in relativity, the energy expressions change. Hmm, maybe I need to write the energy equation.

At maximum displacement, all the energy is potential: E = (1/2)kA². At the equilibrium point (x=0), all the energy is kinetic: E = gamma mc².

Wait, no, that can't be right.
