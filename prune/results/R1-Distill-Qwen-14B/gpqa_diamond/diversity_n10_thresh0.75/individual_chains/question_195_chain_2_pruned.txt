Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem. Let's see, the question is about the maximum orbital period of a second planet that will exhibit both transit and occultation events. Hmm. I remember that transit and occultation events depend on the orbital periods and the orbital distances.

Wait, the first planet has a radius of 1 Earth radius and an orbital period of 3 days. The second planet is bigger, 2.5 Earth radii. The star's radius is 1.5 times the Sun. Both planets are in the same orbital plane, so their orbits are aligned.

So the main thing here is figuring out the condition for the second planet to both transit and be occulted. I think transit happens when the planet passes in front of the star from our point of view, and occultation is when the planet passes behind the star, so we can't see its light. Both events require that the planet's orbit is such that these positions are possible.

But how do orbital periods relate? Oh, right, Kepler's third law comes into play here. The square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the orbital radius. So P² ∝ a³.

Wait, but the first planet has an orbital period of 3 days. Let me calculate its semi-major axis. Using Kepler's law: (P₁²)/(a₁³) = (P₂²)/(a₂³), assuming the same star.

Wait, but Kepler's third law in this context is usually written as P² = (4π²/GM) * a³, where M is the mass of the star. Since both planets orbit the same star, M is the same for both, so the ratio (P₁²)/(a₁³) = (P₂²)/(a₂³).

But I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, I can use the formula with the star's mass. But maybe I can just relate the periods and semi-major axes.

Wait, the problem is about when the second planet can transit and be occulted. For transit, the planet must pass in front of the star, meaning the alignment must be such that the planet's orbit is edge-on enough. Similarly, for occultation, the planet must pass behind the star, so the orbital inclination must be such that when the planet is behind, it's within our line of sight.

Wait, but the question says that the second planet shares the same orbital plane as the first. So their orbital inclinations are the same. So if the first planet transits (so its orbital plane is edge-on enough), the second planet's orbital plane is also edge-on. So both would transit and occult, provided their orbital periods are such that their positions allow these events.

Wait, but that's not exactly right. For the second planet to transit, it must pass in front of the star, but that depends on the orbital distance. But wait, in a multi-planet system, when their orbital periods are commensurate, you can have events where one planet transits another or both transit the star.

But in this problem, I think the key is that the second planet must orbit at a distance such that both transit and occultation are possible. But how?

Alternatively, perhaps the condition is that the second planet
