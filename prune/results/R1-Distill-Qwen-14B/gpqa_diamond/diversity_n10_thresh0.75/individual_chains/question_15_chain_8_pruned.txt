Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and their transit probabilities. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll do my best.

So, the question is about two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. The researchers want to observe the one with the highest probability of transiting, and they have to choose between them. Both have been detected via the radial velocity (RV) method, which gives their minimum masses and orbital periods. 

First, what do I remember about transit probability? The probability that a planet transits its star from our point of view depends on the size of the planet and the star, as well as the size of the planet's orbit. The formula I recall is something like P ≈ (R_planet / R_star)² * (a / (a + R_star)) or something similar, but wait, maybe it's more about the orbital distance and the star's size. Oh right, the transit probability is roughly (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by the chance that the planet's orbital plane is aligned with our line of sight. 

Wait, no, that's not exactly right. The transit probability is given by (R_p + R_s) / a, but normalized in some way. Or wait, I think the probability is approximately (R_p / R_s)² multiplied by (1 / (1 + (a/(R_s))³)^(1/2)) or something more complicated. Hmm, maybe I should think about the formula more carefully.

I think the correct formula for the probability of a planet transiting is P = (R_p / R_s)² * ( (a/(R_s)) ) / (sqrt(a² + (R_s)^2) ) ). Wait, that doesn't seem right. Another approach: the probability is the ratio of the area of the star as seen from Earth to the area of the sphere that the planet's orbit sweeps out. So it's (π R_p²) / (π (a)^2) ), but wait, that's not exactly it. Oh wait, actually, the transit probability is the ratio of the planet's orbital distance to the star's radius in some way. 

Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The transit probability is the likelihood that the planet's orbital plane is aligned such that it passes in front of the star from our perspective. For a circular orbit, the probability that a planet transits is given by P = (R_p / R_s)² * (1 / (1 + (a_p / R_s)^2 ))^(1/2), but wait, no, that's not the exact formula. Alternatively, I remember that the probability is approximately (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by ( (a_p) ) / (sqrt(a_p^2 + R_s^2) )) ), but I'm not sure. 

Alternatively, I think another way to express the transit probability is P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * ( (R_s) / a_p ) ), but that would be (R_p^2 R_s) / (R_s^2 a_p) ) = (R_p^2) / (R_s a_p). Hmm, that might make sense dimensionally. Wait, if a_p is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit, then P is proportional
