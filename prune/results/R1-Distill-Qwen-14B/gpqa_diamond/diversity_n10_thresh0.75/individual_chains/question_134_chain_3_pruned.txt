Okay, I've got this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when some acids and a base are mixed. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

So, the problem states that we're mixing three solutions: 500 mL of 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL of 0.3 M H2SO4, and 200 mL of 0.5 M Ba(OH)2. I need to find the enthalpy change when they're all mixed together. The options are given in kcal and kJ, but I remember that enthalpy of neutralization is usually around -57 kJ/mol (that's about -13.65 kcal/mol) for strong acids and bases. But wait, this might be different because there are multiple acids and a strong base here.

Wait, first, I should probably figure out how much H+ and OH- are present because neutralization is all about H+ and OH- reacting to form water. Let's break it down.

HCl is a strong acid, so it will dissociate completely. H2SO4 is a strong acid too, but wait, in solution, what's the dissociation? H2SO4 is a diprotic acid. The first dissociation is complete, but the second (HSO4- to SO4^2-) is only partial, but when in dilute solutions, it's considered to dissociate completely. Wait, but in this case, since we're mixing with a base, maybe I should assume that all H+ from H2SO4 are available. But wait, wait. H2SO4 is a strong acid, so in aqueous solution, it dissociates into 2 H+ and SO4^2- ions, right? So for each mole of H2SO4, we get 2 moles of H+.

Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. It dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2 OH- ions. So each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives 2 moles of OH-.

Now, to find the neutralization reaction, I need to find the moles of H+ and OH- ions available from each solution.

Let's calculate the moles of each.

First, HCl: volume is 500 mL, which is 0.5 L. Molarity is 0.2 M. Moles = M * V = 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 moles. Since HCl is H+ and Cl- per mole, that's 0.1 moles of H+.

Next, H2SO4: 300 mL is 0.3 L. Molarity 0.3 M. Moles = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles. Each mole gives 2 H+, so 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles H+.

Then, Ba(OH)2: 200 mL is 0.2 L. Molarity 0.5 M. Moles = 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 moles. Each mole gives 2 OH-, so 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 moles OH-.

Wait, but wait. Wait a second, when you mix acids and a base, the H+ from the acids will react with OH- from the base. The reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O. The enthalpy of neutralization is the energy change for this reaction. Since all the H+ and OH- are involved, the limiting reagent will determine how much reaction occurs.

So, total H+ from acids: HCl gives 0.1, H2SO4 gives 0.18. So total H+ = 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 moles.

Total OH- from Ba(OH)2 is 0.2 moles.

So, the reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O. The H+ available is 0.28, OH- is 0.2. So the OH- is the limiting reagent here. So all 0.2 moles of OH- will react, and 0.2 moles of H+ will be used, leaving 0.08 moles of H+ unreacted.

But wait, wait a minute. Because H2SO4 contributes 2 H+ per mole, but does that affect anything? No, because each H+ is the same as any other. So it's just all the H+ combining with OH-.

So the total moles reacting is 0.2 moles of H+ and 0.2 moles OH-.

Wait, but wait again. Wait, when you have H2SO4, which is a diprotic acid, it contributes 2 H+ per mole. So in this case, for 0.09 moles of H2SO4, we get 0.18 mo
