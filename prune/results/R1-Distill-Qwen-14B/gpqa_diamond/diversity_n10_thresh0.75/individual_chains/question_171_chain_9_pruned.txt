Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.

The question is about the electrophilic substitution reactions of six different aromatic compounds with excess bromine. They only form one monobromo derivative each. I need to arrange them in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer. The options are A to D, each presenting a different order.

Hmm. Electrophilic substitution on aromatic rings. I remember that substituents on the benzene ring can direct incoming electrophiles to certain positions. They can be activating or deactivating, and meta or para directors.

So each of these substituents will influence where the bromine adds. Since it's excess bromine, I think it's a case where substitution happens at the most reactive position, but the question is about the para isomer's yield relative to others. Wait, but the question is about the weight fraction of the para-isomer. So that depends on how much the substituent directs the incoming Br+ to the para position.

Wait, but some substituents are meta directors, others para or ortho. So for each substituent, I need to know the directing effect.

Let me list each substituent:

1) C6H5-CH3: That's a methyl group attached to benzene. Methyl is an activating group because it's an alkyl chain which donates electrons through +I effect. So it's an activating, ortho/para director. So when bromine adds, it will go to ortho, para positions more than meta. But wait, in electrophilic substitution, the substituent directs the incoming group to certain positions. So the major product would be a mix of ortho and para. Since steric factors might make para more favorable, so the para isomer is major, but the question is about the fraction, so higher activating groups would lead to more para.

Wait, but wait, the directing effect for methyl is ortho/para. So which is more favored depends on the substituent's ability to stabilize the transition state. Methyl is a strong activating group, so the ring is more reactive, and the substituent directs incoming groups to ortho and para positions.

But for each substituent, what's their effect on the ring?

Let me go through each substituent:

1) C6H5-CH3: Methyl
