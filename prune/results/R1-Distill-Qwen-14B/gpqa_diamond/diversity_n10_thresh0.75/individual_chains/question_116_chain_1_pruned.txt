Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll think it through.

The question starts with Compound A showing two signals in proton NMR. The signals are a triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H and a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. Hmm, I remember that in NMR, the integration tells me the number of hydrogens, and the splitting tells me about neighboring protons.

So, the triplet at 0.9 ppm with 6H. A triplet usually comes from coupling with two neighboring protons. 0.9 ppm is typically a methyl group (CH3) next to something else. Maybe it's a CH2 or another CH3.

The quartet at 1.3 ppm with 4H. A quartet means each proton is split by three neighboring Hs. 4H could be two sets of two Hs each, or maybe one set of four. But wait, 4H as a quartet... Wait, in a quartet, each line is split into four, which usually comes from coupling with three equivalent protons. So maybe it's a CH2 adjacent to a CH3. Because if a CH2 is next to a CH3, each CH2 H would couple with three Hs from the CH3, giving a quartet.

Wait, let me think. If I have a CH2 group next to a CH3, each H on the CH2 would see the three Hs on the adjacent CH3. So the CH2 would be a quartet (n+1 where n=3). Yes, that makes sense. So the quartet is probably a CH2 next to a CH3.

So putting this together: the triplet (6H) is likely two CH3 groups, each adjacent to a CH2. Because each CH3 would give a triplet if they're next to a CH2. Because the CH3 is next to a CH2 (with 2 Hs), each H on the CH2 would split the CH3 into a triplet (n=2, so 2+1=3 peaks). So that fits: two CH3 groups (6H) each as triplet, next to a CH2.

Wait, but the CH2 is a quartet. So the structure would be something like two CH3 groups attached to a central CH2. Wait, but then
