Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem about the luminosities of two stars. Hmm, let me read it again.

So, there's Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Same goes for their masses—they're both 1.5 times bigger. The astronomers found that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, right, the peak wavelength for a black body is given by Wien's Law, which is lambda_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant and T is the temperature. So if their peak wavelengths are the same, their temperatures must be the same too. Because lambda is directly proportional to 1/T, so same lambda means same T.

Wait, but wait. Because both stars have the same peak wavelength, their temperatures must be the same. That makes sense. So T1 = T2.

Now, the question is about their luminosities. I remember that the luminosity of a star (assuming it's a perfect black body radiator) is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR²σT⁴. Where R is the radius, T is the temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.

So for each star, L is proportional to R squared times T to the fourth power. Since both have the same T, the ratio of their luminosities will just be the ratio of R squared.

Wait, but wait. Star_1 has R1 = 1.5 R2. So L1/L2 = (R1^2 T1^4)/(R2^2 T2^4). Since T1 = T2, this simplifies to (R1/R2)^2. So (1.5)^2 = 2.25. So L1 is 2.25 times L2. So the factor is about 2.25, which would be option A.

But wait, there's another part. The problem also mentions the radial velocities. Star_1 has 0 km/s radial velocity, and Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s. Would that affect anything?

Hmm, radial velocity relates to the Doppler shift. When a star moves towards or away from us, its emitted light is shifted in wavelength. But in this problem, the peak wavelengths are the same after accounting for radial velocity. Oh wait, no, the question says they found the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So maybe the observed peak wavelengths are the same. But wait, without considering Doppler shift, their emitted peak wavelengths would be the same because T is same. If there's a Doppler shift, that might change the observed wavelengths. But the problem says the observed wavelengths are same.

Wait, maybe I misapplied the Doppler effect. Let me think. The apparent brightness (luminosity) is affected by distance, but the problem doesn't mention anything about the distance or the Doppler effect on luminosity, just that the radial velocities are given. Wait, the problem says the radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s. So Star_1 is not moving towards or away, but Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s.

Wait, but how does radial velocity affect the observed luminosity? Oh, because if a star is moving towards us, its light is blueshifted, which would cause the observed peak wavelength to be shorter than the emitted. If the observed peak wavelengths are the same for both stars, but Star_2 is moving, maybe that affects their temperatures as we observe them.

Wait, this complicates things. Because the temperature T is what we infer from the peak wavelength using Wien's law. So if Star_2 is moving, its observed wavelength is shifted, which would change the inferred temperature.

Let me try to model this. The Doppler shift formula is: lambda_observed = lambda_emitted * sqrt( (1 + v_r) / (1 - v_r) ) ), but I might have the sign wrong. Wait, the exact formula depends on whether it's moving towards or away. Let's say v_r is the radial velocity, positive when moving away. So if Star
