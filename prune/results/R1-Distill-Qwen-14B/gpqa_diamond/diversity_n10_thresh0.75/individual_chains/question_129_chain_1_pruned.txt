Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a shot.

The question is about identifying compound E based on a series of reactions starting from compound A. There are several steps involved, and some hints provided. Let's break it down.

First, the reaction steps:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to form compound B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 and Pd to form compound C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 to form compound D.
4. Compound D eliminates an inert gas to form compound E.

Plus, there are two hints given.

Let me handle the steps one by one.

Step 1: A + HCN → B.

HCN usually adds to carbonyl groups. So if A is a ketone or aldehyde, B would be a cyanohydrin. Or, if A is an ester, HCN might add differently, but I think more likely A is a ketone. So B would have a hydroxyl and a cyano group added to the carbonyl.

Wait, another possibility: if A is a cyclic ketone, like cyclohexanone. Then HCN would add across the carbonyl, giving a cyanohydrin. So B would be something like cyclohexane with an -OH and a -CN group on adjacent carbons.

But wait, another possibility is that A is an aldehyde. But no, the IR hint might help. The IR of A shows a strong peak around 1750 cm^-1, which is typical for a carbonyl. So A must have a ketone group or maybe an ester. But more likely a ketone since HCN is reacting as a nucleophile.

So B is the cyanohydrin of A.

Step 2: B → C via H2 and Pd.

H2 with Pd is hydrogenation. So B has a nitrile group (from HCN addition). Nitriles can be hydrogenated to amines, but wait, in presence of H2 and Pd, maybe it's a catalytic hydrogenation. Oh wait, nitriles under hydrogenation can be reduced to amines, but sometimes under different conditions. Or wait, perhaps the nitrile is being reduced to an amine, but then again
