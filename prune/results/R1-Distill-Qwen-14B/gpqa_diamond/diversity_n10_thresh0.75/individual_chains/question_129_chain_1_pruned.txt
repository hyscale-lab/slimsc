Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll take it slow.

The question is about identifying compound E in a series of reactions. There are four steps, each transforming one compound into the next. Let me outline what I know.

First, the reaction steps:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to form compound B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 and Pd to form compound C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 to form compound D.
4. Compound D loses an inert gas to form compound E.

I also have some hints. Hint a says that when compound A reacts with an unknown phosphorous ylide, it forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Hmm, phosphorous ylides are usually used in Wittig reactions. The Wittig reaction forms alkenes from aldehydes or ketones. So, compound A must have a carbonyl group, probably a ketone, since the product is an alkene.

Looking at the product from hint a, the structure is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Let me draw that structure mentally. It's a cyclopentane ring. At positions 1 and 2, there are methyl groups. At position 4, there's a substituent which is propan-2-ylidene. Propan-2-ylidene would be a methylene group (CH2) attached to a methyl group (since propan-2-yl is (CH3)2CH, but when it's a ylide, it's CH2 connected to another CH(CH3)2? Wait, no. Wait, the ylide would be like a methylene group (CH₂) connected to a PPh3 or something, but in the product, it's part of the cyclopentane. So the ylide would add a CH₂ group, perhaps.

Wait, more accurately, the Wittig reaction adds an alkene. So, if compound A is a ketone, then the ylide (a phosphorus ylide) would react with it to form an alkene.

So, the product is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Let me think about that structure. The substituents on the cyclopentane ring are:

- At position 1: methyl.
- Position 2: methyl.
- Position 4: a propan-2-ylidene group, which I think is a CH₂ connected to a CH(CH3)₂? Or wait, propan-2-ylidene would be CH₂ connected to a CH(CH3)₂? Wait, no. Propan-2-yl is (CH3)2CH-, but propan-2-ylidene is CH₂–C(CH3)₂? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propenyl group or something else.

Wait, the substituent is (propan-2-ylidene), which is a methylene group (CH₂) attached to a propan-2-
