Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

So, the problem is about cobalt(II) ions and thiocyanate in solution. The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants for the complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. The question is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species.

Hmm. I remember that stability constants, or formation constants, tell us how stable a complex is. The higher the β, the more stable the complex. So, the complexes with higher β values will form more readily.

Wait, the dithiocyanato complex would be the one with two SCN- ions attached. So, the Co(SCN)_2^2+ complex, I think. Because each SCN- is a monodentate ligand. So the complexes are Co(SCN)^n, where n is the number of ligands. So β1 is for CoSCN^+ (n=1), β2 for Co(SCN)_2^2+ (n=2), and so on. But wait, the β values given are 9, 40, 63, 16. So β3 is higher than β2 for n=3, and β4 is for n=4.

But the question is about the blue dithiocyanato complex, which is n=2. So we're looking for the fraction of the Co(SCN)_2^2+ complex.

Wait, but the question mentions 'dithiocyanato' which is two SCN- ions. So that's the β2 complex, right?

So, the setup is that the total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M. That includes all the species: Co^2+ ion and all the Co(SCN)_n complexes.

The thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. Which is quite high compared to the cobalt concentration.

The problem is to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex, which is the [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ complex.

I think the approach here is to consider the formation of all possible
