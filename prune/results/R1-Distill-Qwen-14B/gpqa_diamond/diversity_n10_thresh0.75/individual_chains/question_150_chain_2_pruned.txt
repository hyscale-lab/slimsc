Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the right answer. Let's take it step by step.

First, the question gives me the molecular formula of a compound, which is C8H9NO. Hmm, that's interesting. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation to get an idea of the structure. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, C is 8, H is 9, N is 1, O is 1. So, plugging in: (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 → (18-9+1)/2 → (10)/2 =5. So, five degrees of unsaturation. That could be from, say, a benzene ring (which has three double bonds, contributing 3 degrees) and maybe a double bond or ring elsewhere and an amine or something.

The NMR data is given as:

- 9.72 ppm (t, 1H)
- 6.98 ppm (d, 2H)
- 6.51 ppm (d, 2H)
- 6.27 ppm (bs, 2H)
- 3.66 ppm (d, 2H)

Let me think about what these signals could mean.

Looking at the downfield region first: 9.72 ppm is a triplet (t). That's a high chemical shift, so possibly an aldehyde proton. Wait, but aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm. So that 9.72 could be an aldehyde (RCHO). But wait, sometimes ketones can be around 2-3 ppm, but aldehydes are higher. So maybe that's the aldehyde proton. But wait, the triplet suggests coupling with two neighboring protons. Aldehydes typically only have one proton, so maybe it's something else. Or perhaps it's an aromatic proton that's deshielded, like in a para-substituted benzene ring with electron-withdrawing groups.

Wait, another thought: the triplet at 9.72 could be an aldehyde, but why is it a triplet? That doesn't make much sense. Aldehyde protons are usually singlets because they have no adjacent protons. So maybe that's not an aldehyde. Alternatively, perhaps it's an acidic proton, like an enol or something else. Alternatively, it might be a vinylic proton, like in an enal structure. Or maybe it's an aromatic ring with an electron-withdrawing group, like a nitro group, but the formula doesn't have more N except for the given NO.

Wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. So that's one nitrogen and one oxygen. Let's see, maybe a benzene ring with a substituent that includes the N and O. Like a nitrophenol group or something else.

Looking at the other NMR signals. The 6.98 and 6.51 are doublets, each integrating to 2H. These might be aromatic protons. Let me think: 6.98 is a doublet, which could be two equivalent aromatic protons, perhaps in a
