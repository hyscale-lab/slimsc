Okay, so I have this question about which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal and the HIRES spectrograph at Keck. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step.

First, I remember that each spectrograph has a different brightness limit. ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the question says that ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. So, that means they can see stars that are up to 17 mag. Because higher magnitude numbers mean the star is dimmer. So anything with V mag less than or equal to 17 is visible by ESPRESSO.

HIRES, on the other hand, can observe stars brighter than 16 mag. So, stars with V mag ≤16 can be seen by HIRES. Because 16 is brighter than 17, which ESPRESSO can see. So, to be detected by both, a star must be brighter than (i.e., have lower V mag) than 17 and 16, so the stricter condition is the brighter one. Wait, no, no. Wait, if ESPRESSO can go up to 17 mag, but HIRES can only go to 16, then for a star to be detected by both, it needs to be brighter than 16. Because if a star is 16.5 mag, for example, it's too faint for HIRES but may be within ESPRESSO's limit. Wait, no, no. Wait, no, the way the question is phrased: ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than 17 mag. So that's any star with V mag ≤17. Because the scale is such that lower magnitudes are brighter.

Wait, let me clarify. The magnitude scale is inverse. So a star that's magnitude 17 is fainter than a star that's magnitude 16. So if a telescope can observe stars with V mag brighter than 17, that means it can see stars down to 17 mag. So any star with V mag ≤17 can be observed.

HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 mag, so V mag ≤16.

So, for a star to be detected by both, the star's apparent V magnitude must be ≤16, because that's the limit for HIRES.
