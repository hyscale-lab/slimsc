Okay, so I have this question about which stars can be detected by both ESPRESSO and HIRES spectrographs. Hmm, I remember that these are high-resolution spectrographs used for various astronomical observations. The question gives me some information about each observatory's capabilities.

From what I recall, ESPRESSO is at the Paranal Observatory, which uses the VLT (Very Large Telescope) in Chile. HIRES is at the Keck Observatory in Hawaii. The key here is the apparent V magnitude each can observe. The question states that ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than 17 mag, while HIRES can observe up to 16 mag. So, the stars must have apparent magnitudes brighter than 17 for ESPRESSO and brighter than 16 for HIRES. Wait, wait, no. Wait, the description says, "brighter than 17 mag" for ESPRESSO and "brighter than 16 V mag" for HIRES. So, the limit is V mag less than or equal to 17 for ESPRESSO because lower magnitude means brighter. Wait, waitâ€”apparent magnitude works such that a lower number is brighter. So, if a star is brighter than 17 mag, that's m < 17. Because, say, magnitude 17 is the limit; anything brighter (lower m) is acceptable.

So, for both instruments, the star must be observed by both. So, the star's apparent magnitude must be <=17 for ESPRESSO and <=16 for HIRES. So the more stringent condition is the lower limit (since 16 is brighter than 17). So the apparent V magnitude must be <=16 to be detected by both. Because if a star is brighter than 16, it's also brighter than 17, so both can see it. But a star that is, say, 17 mag would be visible to ESPRESSO but not HIRES. So only stars with V mag <=16 can be observed by both.

Wait, no. Wait, the question says "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed" by ESPRESSO. So that means m < 17, because brighter stars have lower magnitudes. Similarly, for HIRES, m <16, so they can observe stars with m up to 16. So a star with m=
