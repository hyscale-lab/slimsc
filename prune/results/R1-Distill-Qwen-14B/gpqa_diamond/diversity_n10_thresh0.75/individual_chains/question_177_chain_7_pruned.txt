Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. 

So, from what I remember, the luminosity of a star can be calculated using the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which is L = 4πR²σT⁴. Here, R is the radius and T is the effective temperature. Oh right, σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. 

The problem states that both stars' wavelengths of maximum brightness are the same. Wait, the wavelength at which a blackbody radiates most intensely is given by Wien's law, right? Wien's displacement law is λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's constant. So if their λ_max are the same, then their temperatures must be the same. Because λ1 = λ2 implies T1 = T2. Okay, that's a key point.

So both stars have the same temperature. That simplifies things because then the difference in luminosity will come from their sizes and other factors.

Now, what else do I know? Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times that of Star_2. So R1 = 1.5 R2. And the mass is also 1.5 times larger, but wait, I'm not sure if mass affects luminosity in this context. Oh, right, because for main-sequence stars, mass relates to luminosity, but here they're considering blackbody radiation, so probably the radius and temperature are the main factors. Since the temperatures are the same, the mass factor might not play a role here. Or does it?

Wait, no. The question says that the astronomers computed the luminosity using the blackbody model, so they're probably using L = 4πR²σT⁴. So the mass is probably a red herring, or maybe it's related to something else, like radial velocity. Hmm, the radial velocities are given as 0 for Star_1 and 700 km/s for Star_2. Oh, but how does that tie into luminosity? Wait, maybe it's about Doppler shift affecting the observed wavelengths, but since we're told the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same, that probably accounts for any Doppler shifts. Or does it?

Wait, no, the radial velocities are given, but the problem says that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. So perhaps the Doppler shift is already taken into account when they determined the λ_max. Hmm, perhaps not. Let me think. 

Wait, maybe the radial velocities affect the observed temperature. Because if a star is moving towards or away from us, its spectrum shifts, which could affect the observed λ_max. But the problem says that they found the same λ_max. So perhaps that's the observed λ_max, which would have been corrected for radial velocity. 

Alternatively, maybe the radial velocities are irrelevant for the calculation of luminosity in this case. Because the problem is asking about the luminosity computed as black bodies, so perhaps the radial velocity doesn't affect the calculation because they've already found T, so that's taken care of. So maybe I can ignore the radial velocities for the luminosity calculation. Or perhaps not. Wait, maybe the radial velocity affects the observed flux, but the question is about intrinsic luminosity, not observed flux.

Wait, the question says that the radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s. So Star_1 is not moving relative to us, while Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s. But how does that affect luminosity? Luminosity is an intrinsic property, so it shouldn't be affected by velocity. But perhaps the observed flux is affected by Doppler shifts.

Wait, but the question is about the computed luminosity. They computed L using blackbody, so I think the radial velocity data is perhaps a distractor. Because L is intrinsic, not observed flux. So maybe I don't need to worry about the radial velocities here.

So going back: both stars have the same T (since λ_max same), but R1 = 1.5 R2. So the luminosity of Star_1
