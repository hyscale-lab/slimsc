Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

The question involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember that adamantane has a diamondoid structure, so 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have bromine atoms on adjacent carbons in that structure. 

The first reaction is heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with excess KOH at 240Â°C. KOH is a strong base, so I'm thinking this might be a dehydrohalogenation reaction, like an E2 elimination. Since there are two bromine atoms on adjacent carbons (1 and 3 positions), eliminating two HBr molecules would form an allene or maybe a diene. Wait, but in adamantane derivatives, elimination usually gives alkenes. Since there are two bromines, maybe it's an elimination to form a conjugated diene. Wait, wait, adamantane is a polycyclic structure, so the elimination would form a double bond. Let me think: 1,3-dibromoadamantane when treated with KOH would likely lose two HBr molecules, leading to the formation of a double bond between carbons 1 and 2, and another between 3 and 4, but wait, the structure is such that maybe it's a bridgehead elimination. Alternatively, perhaps it's a single elimination, but with two bromines, maybe two elimination steps happen.

Wait, but the product from KOH is a light yellow solid, and the IR shows a peak at 1720 cm^-1, which is indicative of a carbonyl group (C=O). So maybe the reaction isn't elimination but rather a substitution. But KOH is a base, so maybe it's an SN2 reaction on each bromine. But with two bromines, that would give a diol. Wait, but if 1,3-dibromoadamantane undergoes substitution with KOH, each Br would be replaced by OH. But that would give 1,3-diol, but the IR at 1720 suggests a carbonyl, not hydroxyl. Oh wait, maybe it's more like a Hofmann elimination or something else.

Wait, another possibility: when dibromides react with strong bases like KO
