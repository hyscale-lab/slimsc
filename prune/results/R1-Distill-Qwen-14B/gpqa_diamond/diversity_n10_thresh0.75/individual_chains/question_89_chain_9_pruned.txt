Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question describes a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Let me break down what happens in each step.

First step: Heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with excess KOH at 240°C. The product is a light yellow solid, product 1. The 1H NMR of product 1 has specific signals and an IR peak at 1720 cm⁻¹.

Hmm, 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so 1,3-dibromo would have bromine atoms on adjacent carbons? Or wait, no, adamantane is a cage structure. The 1 and 3 positions are on different parts of the cage. When you heat dibromoadamantane with KOH, it's probably undergoing an elimination reaction because KOH is a strong base. Since it's an elimination, likely forming a double bond. But wait, if it's 1,3-dibromo, elimination would form a double bond between those positions. So the product would be 1,3-didehydroadamantane, which is a diene? Or perhaps a single double bond?

Wait, but the IR shows a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹. Oh, that's a carbonyl group. So maybe elimination isn't the only thing happening. Oh wait, wait. KOH could also induce an elimination followed by a cyclization, or perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation leading to formation of a ketone? Wait, no, elimination usually forms alkenes, not ketones. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a double elimination, but that might require two bromides adjacent. Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane—if each bromide is on adjacent carbons, which in adamantane they might be, then elimination would form a double bond. But wait, 1 and 3 positions are not adjacent in the structure. So maybe the elimination is not possible. Alternatively, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation followed by some kind of rearrangement. Oh wait, maybe it's a pinacol-like elimination, but that's for vicinal diols. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, but the IR at 1720 cm⁻¹ suggests a carbonyl, like a ket
