Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about a [4+2] cycloaddition reaction. The reactants are 2,5-dimethylthiophene and furan-2,5-dione, and they're heated. I'm supposed to find the exo product from the options given. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my cycloadditions, but let's think this through.

First, I remember that [4+2] cycloadditions are Diels-Alder reactions. These reactions are between a diene and a dienophile to form a six-membered ring with two new sigma bonds. The diene is usually the conjugated system with four pi electrons, and the dienophile has two. Oh wait, wait, but wait. The dienophile is usually something like a carbonyl group, maybe an electron-deficient system.

Looking at the reactants: 2,5-dimethylthiophene. Thiophene is a five-membered ring with one sulfur. So the structure is a thiophene ring with methyl groups at positions 2 and 5. That would mean the diene part would be the conjugated double bonds in the thiophene. Alternatively, maybe the dienophile is the furan-2,5-dione. Furan-2,5-dione has two ketone groups, right? So it's like an electron-deficient dienophile because the ketones can activate the double bond.

Wait, but the positions on the furan: if it's 2,5-dione, then the carbonyl groups are on carbons 2 and 5. So the dienophile is the furan part with two ketone groups. So the diene would be the thiophene? Or perhaps the other way around.

Wait, no, the thiophene is a conjugated diene. Let me think. Thiophene has conjugated double bonds, so it can act as a diene in a Diels-Alder reaction. So in this case, 2,5-dimethylthiophene would be the diene, and furan-2,5-dione would be the dienophile.

So the Diels-Alder reaction would proceed with the thiophene as the diene and the furan-2,5-dione as the dienophile. The reaction forms a bicyclic
