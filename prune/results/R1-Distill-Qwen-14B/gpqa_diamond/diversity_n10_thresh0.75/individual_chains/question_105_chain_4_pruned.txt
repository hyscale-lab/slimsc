Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem. Hmm, let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question is about a star similar to the Sun, with a radius equal to the Sun's. One hemisphere is covered in dark spots, and the filling factor is 20%. The star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are 1000K cooler. When the star rotates, the spots come into view, causing brightness variations that can mimic an exoplanet transit. The question is asking what the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet would need to be to produce the same brightness variation amplitude as these spots, assuming the star wasn't spotted. So we're comparing the signal from the planet's transit to the signal from the spots.

Wait, wait, but the star has spots that cause a brightness dip when they rotate into view. But the problem states that if the star wasn't spotted, what planet radius would give the same signal. Or is it that the observed brightness variation is similar to that of a planet transit, and we need to find the planet's radius that would cause the same amplitude? Hmm, perhaps I'm mixing up the scenarios.

Let me think again. The star's brightness variation due to the spots is making it appear as if there's a planet causing the dip. So the amplitude of the dip from the spots is being compared to the amplitude that would result from a planet transit. So we need to compute what planet radius would cause the same dip.

The formula for the transit depth is (R_planet / R_star)^2. But wait, that's for the case where the planet blocks the star's light. So the star's brightness drops by that factor squared.

But in this case, the star's brightness variation is due to spots. So how does that work? The spots are cooler, so when they rotate into view, the total brightness of the star decreases. The amount of decrease depends on the area of the spots and their temperature difference from the rest of the star.

The star's total flux without spots would be based on its entire surface. But with spots, part of the surface is emitting less. The flux change depends on the area of the spots and the temperature difference.

Let me outline the steps I think I need to take:

1. Calculate the fraction of the star's surface covered by spots, which is the filling factor. The filling factor is 20%, so 0.2. But wait, the problem says one hemisphere is covered, but the filling factor is 20% of that hemisphere? Or is the entire star's filling factor 20%? Let me read the question again. "One hemisphere of the star is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%." So the filling factor is 0.2, meaning 20% of that hemisphere is covered by spots. Hmm, but wait, the problem might have a typo, perhaps. Alternatively, it might mean that 20% of the entire star's surface is covered. Because each hemisphere is half the star's surface. Oh, wait, no. The star's surface area is 4πR². One hemisphere is 2πR², so 50% of the surface. So if the filling factor is 20%, that would be 0.2 times that hemisphere's area. So the total spotted area is 0.2 * (2πR²) = 0.4πR². Alternatively, perhaps the filling factor is 20% of the entire star's surface. Hmm, the wording is a bit unclear. Let me think: the problem says the hemisphere is covered with a filling factor of 20%. So perhaps the entire star's surface has a filling factor of 20%? Or the hemisphere's own filling factor is 20%?

Wait, the exact wording is: "One hemisphere of the star is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%." So the filling factor is 20% for that hemisphere. So the area of the spots is 0.2 times the area of the
