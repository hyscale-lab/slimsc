Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm supposed to figure it out step by step. Let's start by reading the question carefully.

The question involves a series of reactions starting with toluene. The first step is treating toluene with nitric acid and sulfuric acid to form product 1. Then, product 1 is treated with MnO2 and H2SO4 to get product 2. Finally, product 2 is treated with acetone and aqueous sodium hydroxide to form product 3. The question is about the molecular symmetry group (point group) of product 3. The options are A) cs, B) d2h, C) c2h, D) c3.

Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my point groups, but I'll try to work through this.

First, I need to figure out what each product is. Let's break down each reaction.

Step 1: Toluene treated with nitric acid (HNO3) and sulfuric acid (H2SO4). I remember that nitration is a common reaction here. Toluene undergoes nitration to form nitrotoluene. Since toluene is methylbenzene, and nitration typically occurs in the para position when there are no other substituents, but wait, toluene has a methyl group which is an activating group, so the nitration would occur in the ortho, meta, or para positions relative to the methyl.

Wait, but nitration is a meta-directing group? No, wait. The methyl group is an activating group, ortho/para director. So nitration would occur preferably at the para position. So product 1 is para-nitrotoluene.

Wait, but sometimes the major product is para, but sometimes ortho can be a significant amount. But for this problem, probably assuming the major product, which is para-nitrotoluene. So structure is benzene ring with a methyl group and a nitro group at the para positions.

Wait, actually, nitric acid and sulfuric acid are the nitrating agents. So yes, nitration of toluene gives methyl nitrobenzene, para is major, so product 1 is para-nitrotoluene.

Step 2: Product 1 (para-nitrotoluene) is treated with MnO2 and H2SO4. MnO2 is a strong oxidizing agent
