Okay, so I need to figure out the correct answer to this organic chemistry problem. Let's see what the question is about. 

The problem involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember that adamantane has a diamondoid structure, so 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have bromine atoms on two non-adjacent carbons. 

First reaction: Heating with excess KOH at 240°C. I think this is a dehydrohalogenation or elimination reaction. Because KOH is a strong base, maybe it's an E2 mechanism. Wait, but when you have two bromines on adjacent carbons, elimination would form an alkene. Oh wait, no, 1,3-dibromoadamantane—so the bromines are on carbons 1 and 3 of the adamantane structure. Hmm. But wait, the product is a light yellow solid, and the NMR shows a peak at 4.79 ppm for 2H. That region is usually around where alcohols or ethers show up, but 4.79 is more like an -OH or maybe an -OCH2 group. 

Wait, the IR has a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹. That's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So maybe it's an ester or ketone. But wait, product 1 is formed when 1,3-dibromoadamantane is treated with KOH. Oh, wait, maybe this is a Dieckmann condensation? No, that's for cyclic esters with two ester groups. Alternatively, since KOH is a base, perhaps it's an elimination forming a carbonyl. Oh, but wait, when vicinal dihalides (two adjacent halides) undergo elimination with a strong base, they form alkenes. But if the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, then elimination would require the two Br atoms to be on adjacent carbons, which they might not be. 

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. 1,3-dibromoadamantane has two Br atoms on positions 1 and 3 of the adamantane. In the structure of adamantane, each carbon is bonded to three others in a diamond-like lattice. So, perhaps the 1 and 3 positions are adjacent? Or maybe not. Hmm. 

Alternatively, perhaps the KOH is causing a double elimination. Wait, but the IR
