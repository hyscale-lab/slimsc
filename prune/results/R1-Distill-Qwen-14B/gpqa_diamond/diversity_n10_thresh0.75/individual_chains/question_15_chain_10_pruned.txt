Okay, so I've got this question about transit probabilities of two Earth-like planets. Hmm, I remember that the transit method involves a planet passing in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability of this happening depends on the size of the planet and star, and the alignment of the orbit.

The question says both planets have the same mass, but different orbital periods. Planet_1 has a shorter period—three times shorter than Planet_2. Wait, so Planet_1 is closer to its star since the orbital period is shorter. Oh right, because closer planets orbit faster.

The host stars have the same radii but different masses. Planet_1's star is twice as massive as Planet_2's. Oh, but same radius? That might affect the size of the star and thus the transit probability.

I think the transit probability (P) is given by the formula P = (R_p / (R_s + R_p))² * (a / (a * sin i)), but wait, more accurately, the probability is higher when the orbit is more likely to align edge-on. The formula I remember is P ≈ (R_p / R_s)² * (1 / (a (1 - e²)^(1/2))) ) but wait, I might be mixing this up.

Wait, no, I think the standard transit probability formula is P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (a * (1 - e²)^(1/2))) ) but since both orbits are circular, e=0, so that term is 1. So P is proportional to (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1/a), because a is the semi-major axis.

Wait, no, the probability isn't just that. The actual probability involves the ratio of the planet's orbital size to the star's size in a certain way. Let me think. The probability is roughly (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1 / (a * (1 - e²)^½)). But since e=0 for both, that part is 1. So P ∝ (R_p²) / (R_s² * a) )

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure about the formula. Another approach: the transit probability is the ratio of the area of the star's disk that the planet can cover when crossing our line of sight. So the probability depends on the relative size of the planet to the
