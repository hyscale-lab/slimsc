Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and the probability of them transiting in front of their host stars. Hmm, I remember that the transit method is one way to detect exoplanets—when a planet passes in front of the star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. But wait, how do I calculate the probability of such a transit?

The question says that both planets have been detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Oh right, the RV method gives the planet's minimum mass and orbital period. But for transit probability, I think it's more about the size of the planet relative to the star and the alignment of the orbit.

Wait, so the key factors for transit probability are the size of the planet compared to the star's size and the inclination of the orbit. Oh right! The probability that a planet transits is roughly (R_planet / R_star)² multiplied by something else? Or wait, maybe it's more about the orbital plane's alignment. 

I remember that if the orbit is edge-on, we have a chance to see the transit. The probability depends on the ratio of the planet's orbital distance to something. Oh right, there's a formula for the probability P ≈ (R_star / a)², where 'a' is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Because the transit happens when the planet's orbital plane is aligned with our line of sight, and the probability is higher if the orbit is closer to edge-on. So the probability increases as the planet's orbit is closer to our line of sight, which
