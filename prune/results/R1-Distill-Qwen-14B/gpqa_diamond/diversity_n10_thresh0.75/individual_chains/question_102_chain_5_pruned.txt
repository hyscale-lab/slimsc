Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about a ligand-receptor pair and why the green signal isn't showing up in the microscope. Hmm, let me go through this slowly.

First, the setup: They've created a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. I remember bicistronic means it has two genes in one vector, right? So the ligand ORF is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry. The receptor is at the 3', fused to eGFP. Interesting. So the ligand is first, then the receptor.

The promoters: Ligand is under CBA promoter, which I think is a strong, constitutive promoter. The receptor has an IRES upstream, so IRES elements allow for internal ribosome entry sites, which can drive expression of the downstream gene without a separate promoter. So the receptor might be expressed after the ligand, using the same transcript but via IRES.

Stop cassettes: Between ligand ORF and mCherry, there's a loxP-stop-loxP. And between receptor and eGFP, there's a lox2272-stop-lox2272. Oh, right, the stop cassettes with different lox sites. Normally, when Cre is present, it recombines the lox sites and deletes the stop, allowing the downstream reporter to be expressed.

So when Cre is active, it would remove the stops. So if the Cre is expressed, ligand would be expressed with mCherry, and receptor with eGFP. But wait, the question says they used SOX10-Cre mice. So in the offspring, the Cre is active in neural crest cells, maybe?

Wait, the vector is a lox-Cre vector. So I'm a bit confused about how the Cre is delivered. Oh, wait, the question says they made a mouse model homozygous for the construct in a wt background. Then they crossed it to SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice.

So the construct is in the mouse, and then Cre is introduced via SOX10-Cre. I think that in the construct, the Cre would be under the control of the SOX10 promoter, so it's active in neural crest cells, perhaps.

But wait, in the vector, do they have a Cre under a promoter, or is the Cre provided by another source, like the SOX10-Cre mice?

Wait, the vector is a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. So the construct probably contains the Cre under a promoter, and it's flanked by lox sites. When Cre is expressed, it excises the stop cassettes to allow expression of the ligand and receptor with their respective tags.

But in the case here, they've made a mouse model where the construct is inserted, and when they cross with SOX10-Cre, the Cre from the SOX10-Cre mice would activate the construct.

Wait, but the question says the mouse is homozygous for the construct. So each allele has this bicistronic vector. Then, when they cross with SOX10-Cre mice, which are hemizygous, the Cre would be active in their offspring.

So the Cre would recombine the lox sites, removing the stops. So the ligand would be expressed with mCherry, and the receptor with eGFP. So when they look for the eGFP signal, they should see it if the receptor is expressed.

But they don't see green. Hmm. So why?

The options are:

A) ligand and receptor are paracrine. Paracrine means acting on nearby cells. So perhaps the ligand is secreted and acts on neighboring cells, but does that affect expression in
