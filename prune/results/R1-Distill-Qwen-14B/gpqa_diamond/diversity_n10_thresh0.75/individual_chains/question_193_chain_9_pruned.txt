Okay, let me try to work through this problem. So, the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance based on their parallax. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact details.

Wait, parallax is the apparent shift in position of a star as observed from Earth during different times of the year. The formula for distance in parsecs is 1 divided by the parallax in arcseconds, right? So, distance r = 1/plx, where plx is the parallax. Okay, that's clear.

The problem states that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So, N ∝ 1/plx^5. But we need to find how N changes with distance, not parallax. Since r = 1/plx, maybe I can express plx in terms of r.

Let me rearrange that formula: plx = 1/r. So substitute that into the original equation. N is proportional to 1/( (1/r) )^5. Let's compute that exponent: (1/r)^5 is 1/r^5, so 1 divided by that is r^5. So N ∝ r^5.

Wait, but wait. That would mean as r increases, the number of stars increases with the fifth power. But wait, that doesn't make sense intuitively. Because as you go farther, you'd expect more volume, so more stars, but the number density could affect it.

Wait, let me think again. The number of stars per unit volume depends on how many stars are
