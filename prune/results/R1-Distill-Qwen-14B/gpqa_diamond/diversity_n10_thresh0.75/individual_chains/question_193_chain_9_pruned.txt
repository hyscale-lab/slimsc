Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again. The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over parallax to the fifth power. So, the number of stars, N, is proportional to 1/(parallax)^5. And the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance r. The options are A to D, with different powers of r.

Hmm, I remember that parallax and distance are inversely related. Oh right, parallax (plx) is equal to 1 over distance (d) in parsecs. So plx = 1/d. Therefore, d = 1/plx.

But wait, the problem says N varies with plx^-5. So N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5. Let me write that as N ∝ plx^(-5). Since plx is 1/d, substituting that in, N would be proportional to (1/d)^(-5) which is d^5. So N ∝ d^5.

Wait, but the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range. Oh, so they want the rate of change of N with respect to distance, like dN/dr. Because when you move a small distance dr, how does the number of stars change?

Alternatively, maybe it's about the differential number density. Because if N is proportional to d^5, then when you go from some distance to d + dr, the number of stars would be N(d + dr) - N(d) ≈ dN/dr * dr. So the change in N per unit distance is the derivative dN/dr.

Let me think about the relationship. N varies as d^5, so N = k * d^5, where k is some constant. Taking the derivative of N with respect to d, dN/dd = 5k d^4. So the number of stars per unit distance increases with d^4.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Another approach could be considering the volume. Because the number of stars depends on the volume, which depends on distance. But wait, this is a specific region of the sky, so perhaps it's a thin slice. Maybe the formula given isn't about the entire space but a specific region, so it's already accounting for some factors.

Wait, let me think again
