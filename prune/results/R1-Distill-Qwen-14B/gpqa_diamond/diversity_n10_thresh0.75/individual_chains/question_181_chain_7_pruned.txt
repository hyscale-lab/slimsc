Okay, so I've got this question about neutrino flux from the Sun, right? Hmm. Let me think through this step by step because I'm a bit rusty on my solar neutrino physics.

The question says that the pp-III branch suddenly stopped in the Sun's core about 8.5 minutes ago, and all other reactions continued as usual. We need to find the ratio of the flux between two neutrino energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). The options are A to D, and the choices are factors of 10.

Wait, first, I should recall what the pp-III branch is. The proton-proton chain is the main source of energy in the Sun, right? The pp chain has a few branches. I think the pp-I branch produces helium-4, and the pp-II and pp-III are variations involving boron or something else. Oh wait, maybe I'm mixing this up. Oh right, the pp-III branch is one of the higher branches in the proton-proton cycle, which involves more protons and produces higher energy neutrinos. 

So neutrinos are produced in the Sun through the fusion processes. The dominant source is the pp chain, which emits electron neutrinos (Î½_e). The main contributors are the pep (proton-electron-proton) and the pp-III branches, I think. Wait, the pp-III branch is sometimes called the "high-mass" branch because it involves more protons and higher energies. So the pp-III process produces higher energy neutrinos compared to the pp-I branch.

If the pp-III branch suddenly stops, that would mean that a significant source of high-energy neutrinos is gone. But wait, the question says all other reactions remain as they were. So the other branches (like pp-I and pep) are still active.

Now, the neutrino flux we receive on Earth comes from various sources within the Sun. The dominant ones are the pp chain, which emits lower-energy neutrinos, and the CNO cycle, which contributes higher-energy ones. But the CNO cycle isn't the main contributor in the Sun's core, I think. The Sun is mostly using the pp chain, especially in the core where the temperature isn't high enough for the CNO cycle to dominate. Wait, no, the CNO cycle is more prominent in higher-mass stars, but our Sun is a G-type star. So the core is dominated by the pp chain, but the outer regions might have some CNO cycle contributions.

But wait, high-energy neutrinos in the Sun's spectrum come from which processes? Oh right, the pep branch and the pp-III branch emit higher-energy neutrinos. The main pp branch (I think pp-I) emits lower-energy neutrinos.

So, the question is about the flux in two bands: 700-800 keV and 800-900 keV. So band 1 is lower than band 2. If the pp-III branch stops, which neutrinos are affected?

The pp-III branch emits neutrinos with higher energies. So if that's stopped, the high-energy neutrinos (like in band 2, 800-900 keV) would be significantly reduced. But the lower-energy ones (700-800) are mainly from the other
