Okay, I've got this question about neutrinos from the Sun. Hmm, so the question is about the flux ratio between two energy bands after the pp-III branch stops. Let me think step by step.

First, I remember that the Sun's energy production involves several processes. The main one is the proton-proton chain, which has branches. The pp-III branch is one of them, right? I think it's part of the fusion process where protons fuse into helium nuclei.

The pp-III branch is probably one of the minor contributors. Wait, so if it stops suddenly, what happens to the neutrino production? Neutrinos are produced in different parts of the Sun. The pp-III branch produces neutrinos, maybe the electron neutrinos?

I recall that the pp-III branch involves the fusion of a carbon-12 nucleus with a helium-4 nucleus to form oxygen-16. This process emits a carbon-12 nucleus as well, and I think it also emits a neutrino. Or wait, maybe it's the triple-alpha process? No, that's for heavier elements. No, the pp-III branch must be part of the main proton-proton cycle.

Wait, the main proton-proton chain has two branches, I think. The pp-I and pp-II. Oh wait, maybe pp-III is another branch, perhaps involving higher energy or different products. So, if the pp-III stops, but others continue, the neutrino flux from that particular branch would stop.

Neutrinos from the Sun are mainly produced via the proton-proton chain, and a smaller fraction from the CNO cycle. So if pp-III stops, perhaps the neutrinos from that specific process would stop. But wait, the question says all other reactions remain as they were. So the pp-I and II continue, as do the CNO cycle.

So neutrino production is mainly from the pp chain, with a lesser contribution from CNO. But the pp chain itself has multiple branches. Let's think about the neutrino types. The dominant neutrinos are electron neutrinos, and the different branches might contribute differently.

Wait, the pp-III branch produces neutrinos? Or does it? Because the main pp chain involves two protons fusing into deuterium, then another proton to form helium-3, and then two helium-3 fusing into helium-4, releasing two protons (hydrogen) and two neutrinos. Oh wait, I think each of those steps may emit neutrinos.

Wait,
