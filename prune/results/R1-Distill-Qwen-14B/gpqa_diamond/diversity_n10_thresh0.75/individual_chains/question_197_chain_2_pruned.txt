Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a shot.

The question is about identifying the final product when compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. The options are A to D, each a different organic compound. I need to figure out what X is and then what happens when it undergoes this reaction.

First, let me look at the spectral data given. The IR and NMR data will help me determine the structure of compound X.

Starting with the IR data: The peaks are at 3400–2500 cm⁻¹, which usually indicates an O-H stretch or maybe an N-H. But since the other peaks include 1720 cm⁻¹, that's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. The peaks at 1610 and 1450 cm⁻¹ might be from aromatic rings, possibly C=C stretching in substituted benzene rings.

Now the 1H NMR data:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): A broad singlet around 10.5 ppm is likely an aldehyde proton (RCHO) because aldehydes typically show up around 9-10 ppm. But wait, sometimes carboxylic acids can also show up around 10-12 ppm, but that's usually a broad peak due to hydrogen bonding. However, another possibility is that this is a phenolic OH, but phenolic OHs are usually broader and maybe a bit lower, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, the singlet could be an acidic proton like from a carboxylic acid.

- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): These are typical of a para-substituted aromatic ring, like a benzene ring with two substituents in the para positions. The doublets suggest coupling between adjacent protons. So maybe a para-substituted benzene with two substituents on opposite positions. For example, if the ring has a substituent at position 1 and another at position 4, but wait, that's the same as para. Wait, the two doublets each have 2H, so maybe it's a disubstituted benzene where each substituent has two protons. Alternatively, maybe it's a mono-substituted benzene where the substituent is such that the remaining protons are in two sets of doublets. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Another thought: perhaps it's a para-substituted benzene where each substituent is an -OCH3 or something else that affects the neighboring protons. Alternatively, if a substituent is an electron-withdrawing group, the ring protons could split into doublets.

Wait, but looking at the chemical shifts: 8.0 ppm is higher, which would suggest more deshielded protons, maybe near an electron-withdrawing group. 7.2 is lower, so perhaps adjacent to an electron-donating group? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a di-substituted benzene with substituents in the para positions, each causing their neighboring protons to be split into doublets.

The next NMR peak is at 2.9 ppm, a multiplet integrating for 1H. That's in the range of a CH near an electronegative atom, maybe a carbonyl. For example, maybe a CH adjacent to a carbonyl group, like in a ketone or ester, or maybe an acyl group.

Then 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): This could be a CH2 group adjacent to another CH group, maybe part of a chain. Or perhaps an ethyl group next to a branching point.

1.4 ppm (d, 3H): A triplet of three protons as a doublet? Wait, a doublet with 3H is a bit unusual, but perhaps it's a methyl group attached to a CH, like in an isobutyl group. For example, the CH in an isob
