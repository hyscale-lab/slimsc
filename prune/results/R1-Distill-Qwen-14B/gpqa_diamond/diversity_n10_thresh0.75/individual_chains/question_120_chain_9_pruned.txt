Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, let me think. The question says that stars are uniformly distributed. Wait, what does that mean exactly? Uniformly distributed probably means that the number density of stars is the same in all directions. So, the same number of stars per unit volume in every part of space. But wait, the question is about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Oh, right, parallax is related to distance. Parallax (plx) is the apparent shift in a star's position as seen from Earth as we orbit the Sun. The formula I remember is plx = 1/distance (in parsecs). So, higher plx means closer stars.

The question is about the number of stars per unit range of plx. Let's think in terms of how many stars are in a slice of the sky when you consider a certain change in parallax.

Wait, the number should depend on the volume of space at a certain distance. Since the stars are uniformly distributed, the number in a volume is proportional to the volume. So, if I consider a thin shell at distance d with thickness dd, the volume would be the surface area of the shell multiplied by the thickness. The surface area of a sphere is 4πr², but since we're dealing with a shell, it's about the area per steradian or something? Wait, maybe I should approach it more carefully.

The number of stars N in a volume dV is n*dV, where n is the number density (stars per unit volume). So, for a thin shell at distance d with thickness dr, the volume would be 4π d² dr (since it's the surface area of radius d times dr). So, dV = 4π d² dr.

But wait, parallax plx is 1/d. So, plx = 1/d → d = 1/plx. So, let me change variables from d to plx. Let's express everything in terms of plx.

dr = derivative of d with respect to plx. Since d = 1/plx, dr/dplx = derivative of (1/plx) w.r. to plx. Let's compute that: derivative of (plx)^(-1) is - (plx)^(-2) → dr = - (1/plx²) dplx. Hmm, but since plx is positive and decreases as d increases, when plx increases, d decreases
