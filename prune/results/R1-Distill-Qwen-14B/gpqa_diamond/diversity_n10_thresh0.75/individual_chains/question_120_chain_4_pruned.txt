Okay, so I have this astronomy question here about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax is the apparent shift of a star's position as seen from Earth when we look at it from different points in our orbit. The formula I think is plx = 1/distance, where distance is in parsecs. So parallax is inversely proportional to the distance.

The question says stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. Uniformly distributed probably means that the number of stars doesn't depend on direction, just distance. So more stars are at a certain distance, or how does the density change with distance?

Wait, the question is about how the number of stars per unit range of plx changes with plx. So, the number of stars in a specific range of parallax (like between plx and plx + dplx) would depend on how many stars are at those distances.

Let me think about the distribution. Since the stars are uniformly distributed, the number density (n) is constant with distance. So n is the same everywhere.

The volume of a spherical shell at distance r with thickness dr is 4πr² dr. So the number of stars in that shell would be n * 4πr² dr.

But wait, I need to relate this to parallax. Since plx p = 1/r (r in parsecs), so r = 1/p. So dr = - (1/p²) dp, because differentiating r = 1/p gives dr = -1/p² dp. The negative sign just indicates that as p increases, r decreases.

So the number of stars per unit parallax (d p) would be n * 4 π (1/p)^2 * (-1/p²) dp. Wait, let me rephrase that.

Number of stars in a shell with parallax between p and p+dp is:

dN = n * 4π r² dr

But r = 1/p, dr = - (1/p²) dp.

So substituting:

dN = n * 4π (1/p²) * (-1/p²) dp

Wait, wait, that would be n * 4π (1/p²) * ( -1/p² dp ). But the negative sign just comes from the fact that as p increases, r decreases, but when considering a small dp positive, it's actually moving in the direction of decreasing p. So maybe I should ignore the negative sign since
