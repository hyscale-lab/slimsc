Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve. Let me read through it carefully and think through each step. The question is about titrating a solution of acetic acid with NaOH and finding the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. Hmm, I remember that titration involves neutralizing an acid with a base, and pH changes depending on how much base is added.

Alright, the problem states: We dilute 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and the equivalence point. The options are A, B, C, D.

First, I should probably figure out the initial concentrations after dilution. So, initial moles of acetic acid (CH3COOH) would be volume times molarity. The initial volume is 20 cm³ (which is 0.02 liters) and concentration is 0.05 M. So moles = 0.02 L * 0.05 mol/L = 0.001 mol.

Then, we add 20 cm³ of water. So the total volume after dilution is 40 cm³ or 0.04 liters. The new concentration of acetic acid would be moles/volume. So 0.001 mol / 0.04 L = 0.025 M. Wait, that makes sense because we doubled the volume, so concentration halves. So 0.05 M becomes 0.025 M after adding same volume of water.

Now, when titrating with NaOH, which is a strong base, it will react with the acetic acid. The reaction is: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^-Na+ + H2O.

The equivalence point is when moles of NaOH added equals moles of CH3COOH. Let me calculate the equivalence point volume.

Moles of acetic acid is 0.001 mol. The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M. So volume needed is moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³.

So, the equivalence point is at 10 cm³ of NaOH. The question asks for the pH at 25% titration. 25% of the equivalence point volume would be 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added.

Wait, no. Wait, 25% of the titration refers to 25% of the equivalence point volume. So yes, 2.5 cm³. Alternatively, perhaps it's 25% of the total volume, but I think it's more likely 25% of the required volume to reach the equivalence point.

So, at 25% titration, we've added 2.5 cm³ of NaOH. Let me calculate moles of NaOH added: 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 mol.

The initial moles of acetic acid were 0.001 mol. After adding 0.00025 mol NaOH, which reacts with acetic acid, the moles of CH3COOH will decrease by 0.00025, and the moles of acetate (CH3COO^-) will increase by the same amount. So:

Moles CH3COOH = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol.
Moles CH3COO^- = 0.00025 mol.

The total volume of the solution at this point is the initial diluted volume (40 cm³) plus the NaOH added (2.5 cm³) → 42.5 cm³ or 0.0425 L.

So concentrations are:
[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M.
[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

This is a buffer solution, so we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]).

The pKa is given by -log(Ka). Ka is 1.85e-5. So pKa ≈ 4.73 (since log(1.85e-5) is about 4.73, because log(2e-5)=4.7, but precise calculation: log(1.85)=0.267, so 4.73).

So, pH = 4.73 + log(0.005882 / 0.017647).

Let me compute the ratio: 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.3333.

Log(1/3) is approximately -0.477. So pH = 4.73 -0.477 ≈ 4.253.

Looking at the options, option A is 4.26 for the first value. So that's a possible match.

Wait, but let me make sure. Alternatively, maybe I messed up the calculations.

Wait, 0.00025 divided by 0.042
