Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve. Let's see, it's about titration of acetic acid with NaOH. Hmm, I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base. The question is asking about the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A, B, C, D with different values. Alright, let's break this down step by step.

First, I need to figure out what's happening when I dilute the acetic acid. The initial volume is 20.00 cm³ (which is 0.02 liters) of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we add 20 cm³ of water, so the total volume becomes 40 cm³ (0.04 L). 

I think I should calculate the new concentration after dilution. The formula for dilution is M1V1 = M2V2. So M2 would be (0.05 M * 20 cm³) / 40 cm³. Let me calculate that. 0.05 * 20 is 1, divided by 40 gives 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid concentration is 0.025 M.

Wait, but when you titrate this with NaOH, which is a strong base, the reaction will be between the acetic acid (CH3COOH) and NaOH (OH-). The reaction should produce acetate ions (CH3COO-) and water. The balanced equation is CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^-Na+ + H2O.

At 25% titration, what does that mean? I think it means that 25% of the moles of acetic acid have reacted with NaOH. So I need to find the moles of acetic acid initially and then see how much has been neutralized.

Wait, the initial moles of acetic acid before dilution: Molarity * Volume = 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 mol. After dilution, the concentration is lower, but the number of moles remains the same. Oh right, because when you dilute, you don't add or remove moles, just spread them out more. So moles of CH3COOH after dilution is still 0.001 mol in 0.04 L.

When titrated, the moles of NaOH added will determine how much of the acid has been neutralized. Let's think about the equivalence point first because that might be easier. The equivalence point is where all the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH.

Moles of NaOH needed for equivalence: same as moles of CH3COOH, which is 0.001 mol. So the volume of NaOH needed is moles / concentration. So 0.001 mol / 0.1 M = 0.01 L, which is 10 mL. So the equivalence point is when 10 mL of NaOH is added.

But wait, the problem is at 25% titration, so that's 25% of the equivalence point volume.
