Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me see... The question is about finding probabilities and the average value of an operator.

Alright, the state |alpha> is given as proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. Hmm, wait, since it's proportional, I think that means we need to normalize it first. Because when dealing with quantum states, they have to have a norm of 1. So the first thing I should do is find the normalization constant.

The normalization process involves taking the inner product of the state with itself and then dividing the state by the square root of that inner product. Let me compute that inner product.

So the state is (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. The inner product <alpha|alpha> would be [(1-i) (2+i)]* because the conjugate of (1+i) is (1-i), same with (2-i) conjugates to (2+i). Wait, no, wait: the state is (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>, so the conjugate transpose (bra) would be (1-i)<up| + (2+i)<down|.

So when I compute <alpha|alpha>, it's [(1-i)(1+i)] * <up|up> + [(1-i)(2-i)] * <up|down> + [(2+i)(1+i)] * <down|up> + [(2+i)(2-i)] * <down|down>.

Wait, but |up> and |down> are orthonormal, meaning <up|down> is zero. So the cross terms will vanish. That simplifies things. So it's just |1+i|^2 + |2-i|^2.

Calculating each term:

|1+i|^2 is (1^2 + 1^2) = 2.

|2 - i|^2 is (2^2 + (-1)^2) =4 +1=5.

So the total norm is 2 +5=7. So the normalization constant is 1/sqrt(7). So the actual state is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

Wait no, wait. Wait, the original state is proportional, so when we normalize, it's (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> all multiplied by 1/sqrt(7). So the state |alpha> is [ (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

Okay, next part: the operator whose matrix representation has elements A_ij = hbar/2 if i â‰  j, and 0 otherwise. Hmm. So for a 2x2 matrix, the diagonal elements are zero, and the off-diagonal elements are hbar/2.

So the matrix is:
[ 0    hbar/2 ]
[hbar/2  0 ]

What is this operator? Oh, wait, that's the Pauli X matrix multiplied by hbar/2. Because the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So A = (hbar/2) * sigma_x.

So the eigenstates of this operator would be the same as the eigenstates of sigma_x, right? Because scaling by a factor doesn't change the eigenstates, just the eigenvalues. So the eigenstates of sigma_x are the superposition (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), with eigenvalues +1 and -1 respectively. So for operator A, the eigenvalues would be hbar/2 * 1 and hbar/2 * (-1), so hbar/2 and -hbar/2.

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, since A is (hbar/2) times sigma_x, the eigenvalues are (hbar/2)*1 and -(hbar/2).

So to find the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of A, I need to express |alpha> in the basis of A
