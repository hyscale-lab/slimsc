Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy question about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, let's see. Both stars have the same mass, similar to the Sun. Each has a planet with mass similar to Neptune. The planets are in circular orbits.

The question is about the orbital periods. Planet #1 causes a 5 milliangstrom shift, and Planet #2 causes a 7 milliangstrom shift. Wait, no—wait, wait. I think I might have that backwards. Oh wait, the shift is from the star's spectrum moving due to the planet's gravity. So, the bigger the shift, the more massive the planet? Or wait, no, because it's the Doppler shift due to the star's movement. So, the star's velocity is what's causing the spectral line shift.

Wait, the RV method measures the star's velocity towards and away from us. The formula for the RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(1/3) ) ) ) * (1/(1 + M_p/M_* )) )^(1/3) ) * (sin i / ( (1-e²)^(0.5) ) )

Wait, but since both planets are similar to Neptune and the stars are like the Sun, M_p is much less than M_*, so M_* + M_p ≈ M_*. So the equation simplifies a bit. Also, e is zero because the orbits are circular. And sin i is 1 because we're assuming the orbits are edge-on, right? Because otherwise, if it's face-on, we wouldn't detect the planet via RV. But the question says they detected planets, so inclination is 90 degrees, so sin i =1. Okay.

So, the RV semi-amplitude K is given approximately by:

K ≈ ( (G * M_p ) / (M_*^(2/3)) ) ) * (1/( ( (1 + M_p/M_* ) ) * (1 year ) ) )^(1/3) ) * (1/ ( (1 + M_p/M_* ) ) )

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the formula for K. The exact formula is:

K = [ (2π G) / (c T ) ]^(1/3) * ( (M_p sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) )

Hmm
