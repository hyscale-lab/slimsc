Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Hmm, it's about the Cope rearrangement. I remember learning that the Cope rearrangement is a [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement of 1,5-dienes. The reaction usually happens under heat or sometimes even light. The rearrangement leads to a shift in the positions of the double bonds.

Alright, looking at the question, there are two parts: reaction A and reaction B. I need to find the major products for each and match them with the options.

Starting with reaction A: The starting material is ((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene. Let me draw that structure. So, benzene ring with a substituent. The substituent is an oxygen connected to a CH2 group, and then attached to a 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl group. Wait, but wait, the structure is ((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl. So the benzene is attached to a CH2-O- group, which is connected to the 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl.

The 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl group would be: CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2? No, wait. Let's see: but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2CH2- but with a substituent. Wait, but the structure is 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl. So, the chain is four carbons, with a double bond between C2 and C3. The substituent is on C3. So the structure is CH2-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Wait, no, wait.

Wait, but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2CH2- but the position is 1-yl, so the substituent is at position 1. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's imagine but-2-en-1-yl: the double bond is between C2 and C3, and the substituent (like the oxygen) is attached to C1. So, the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH2-O
