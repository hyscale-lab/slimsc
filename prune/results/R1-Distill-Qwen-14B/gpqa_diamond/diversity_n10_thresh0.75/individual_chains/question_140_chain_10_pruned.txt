Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to work through it step by step. Let me read it again and break it down.

The question is about a substance X that reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing gas W. The gas W has a molecule where the number of neutrons and protons are the same. Then, a precipitate G forms, which upon heating releases B. The melting point of B is close to 277 K, which is about 4 degrees Celsius. So B is a solid at normal temperatures but just a bit above freezing.

Then there's another part about a keto acid reacting with X to produce a product with two oxygen atoms. Also, X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, and it incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X, considering all isotopes present.

Hmm, okay. Let me think about what each part might indicate.

First, let's think about the reaction between X and Y. Liquid Y could be something like water. If X reacts violently with liquid Y, maybe it's a metal reacting with water. Metals like potassium or sodium react violently with water, producing hydrogen gas. So gas W might be H2.

Wait, but the gas W's molecule has the same number of protons and neutrons. Hydrogen has one proton and one neutron in its isotope deuterium. So H2 would have two H atoms, each with one proton and one neutron. So each molecule of H2 has 2 protons and 2 neutrons, but wait, the problem says the molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. So H2 would have 2 H atoms, each with 1 p and 1 n. So total protons: 2, total neutrons: 2. So yes, same number. So W is H2, which makes sense with Y being water.

So if Y is water, then X is a metal that reacts with water to produce hydrogen gas. Metals like Na, K, Ca, maybe Mg. But wait, the reaction is violent. Potassium is more reactive than sodium, so maybe X is potassium?

Wait, but wait. Another thought: If the reaction is violent and produces H2, then X could be a metal like potassium (K) or sodium (Na). Let me think about the precipitate G. When a metal reacts with water, especially a metal that's more active than hydrogen, you get the metal hydroxide as a precipitate. For example, 2 Na + 2 H2O → 2 NaOH + H2↑. So G would be NaOH, but wait, sodium hydroxide is soluble. Hmm, maybe it's a different reaction. Or perhaps the reaction is with a different liquid Y.

Wait, maybe Y isn't water. Another possibility is that Y is an acid. But if Y is a liquid, maybe sulfuric acid or something else. Alternatively, perhaps Y is an alcohol, but that might not produce H2. Hmm.

Wait, but another thought: The precipitate G, when heated, releases B. What if G is a carbonate? Because when heated, carbonates decompose into CO2 and the metal oxide. Alternatively, maybe the precipitate is a hydroxide that decomposes upon heating. Wait, sodium hydroxide doesn't decompose much upon heating unless something else happens. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the precipitate is something else. Let me think about the gas W again. If W is H2, that suggests a reaction with an acid or water. Alternatively, maybe W is CO2, but that's less likely because the reaction with metals would not produce CO2 unless maybe reacting with carbonates.

Wait, let me get back to the main points. The melting point of B is about 277 K. That's about 4°C. So B is a solid near that temperature. What common substances melt around there? Water freezes at 273 K (0°C), so 277 is a bit higher. Maybe something like ice, but that's the same as water. Alternatively, maybe a solid like sodium hydroxide? Wait, no
