Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and honestly, it's a bit tricky, but let's break it down step by step. I'll take it slow and try to think through each part carefully.

The question is about a substance X reacting with liquid Y, producing gas W, precipitate G, and eventually product B. There are some clues about their properties, and then we have a part about a keto acid reacting with X. The goal is to find the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X.

First, let's parse the question sentence by sentence.

1. **Substance X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements.**
   So X has at least two elements, and one of them has a heavier isotope. Maybe X is a compound where one element is present in an isotope form. I'm thinking maybe something like Cl in a compound, since Cl has isotopes. Or perhaps something else.

2. **X reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing gas W.**
   Violent reactions could involve something like an acid reacting with a carbonate, or a metal reacting with an acid. Gas W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. Hmm, that's an interesting clue. So for a molecule, the number of protons (which equals the number of electrons in a neutral molecule) and neutrons are the same.

3. **Gas W's molecule has same number of neutrons and protons.**
   Let's think about possible gases. Common ones are O2, N2, H2, CO2, etc. Let's calculate.

   For example:
   - H2: Each H has 1 proton and 0 neutrons (if it's protium). So, molecule has 2 protons, 0 neutrons. Not the same.
   - O2: Each O has 8 protons. Neutrons? Oxygen-16 has 8, O-18 has 10. But the molecule is O2. So total protons = 16 (each O has 8, two atoms). Neutrons would be 8*2 = 16 if it's O-16. So in that case, protons (16) and neutrons (16) are same. Oh, that works! So W could be O2.

   Or another possibility: CO2. Let's see: CO2 has a molecular formula of C:6 protons, O:8 each. So in CO2, total protons are 6 + 16 = 22. Neutrons: For C, if it's C-12, 6 neutrons. Each O is O-16, 8 neutrons. So total neutrons: 6 + 8*2 = 22. So again, same number of protons (22) and neutrons (22). So CO2 is another possibility.

   Wait, but the question says the molecule of W has same number of protons and neutrons. So W could be O2 or CO2 or others?

   Let's think about other possibilities. Maybe CH4? Protons: 6 (C) + 4*1 (H) = 10. Neutrons: C-12 has 6, H has 0 (assuming protium). So 6 + 0 =6. 10 vs 6: not same. No.

   What about H2O? Protons: 2 + 8 =10. Neutrons: 0 (H) + 8 (O-16) *1 =8. Not same.

   Let's think about N2: Each N has 7 protons. So 14 in total. Neutrons: N-14 has 7. So for N2: 14 protons, 14 neutrons. So that's a fit too. So W could be N2 or O2 or CO2.

   Alternatively, maybe heavier molecules. But let's not get too carried away. Let's see what else in the question can help us.

4. **A precipitate G forms, which when heated releases B.**
   So G is a precipitate, which upon heating gives B. The melting point of B is very close to 277 K. 277 K is about 4 degrees Celsius. Hmm, which solid has a melting point around there? Maybe something like ammonium chloride? Wait, no, that's higher. Or maybe water? No, water freezes at 273 K (0 C). Oh wait, 277 is about 4 C. So maybe something like iodine? No, iodine's melting point is higher. Alternatively, maybe B is a solid that's just above 0 C. Wait, perhaps B is something that's solid at 0 C but just starts to melt a bit higher.

   Wait another angle: the product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with X contains 2 atoms of oxygen. So the product has two O atoms. Maybe it's a dehydration reaction or something else. I'm not sure yet.

5. **The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.**
   So, when a keto acid reacts with X, the product has two O atoms. Keto acids are like acetic acid, which is CH3COOH. Maybe X is something like an alcohol or a base that can react with a keto acid to form something else.

Wait, let's think about the reaction between X and Y. X is a substance that reacts with Y to produce W, G, and B. Let me think of a possible reaction.

If X is a metal, reacting with an acid (Y), producing gas (like H2), precipitate (like a metal hydroxide), and maybe something else. But let's see.

Wait, let me think about the precipitate G that upon heating gives B. If G is a carbonate, maybe when heated, it decomposes into CO2 and some oxide. Or if G is a hydroxide, maybe it decomposes into a metal oxide and water. Alternatively, G could be a sulfide, but that's less likely.

Wait, the melting point of B is near 277 K, which is 4 C. That's just above the melting point of ice. So B could be a substance that's solid at 0 C but melts a bit higher. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps B is a solid that sublimes or something else.

Wait, let's think of possible reactions. Suppose X is a metal carbonate, reacting with an acid (Y) to produce CO2 gas (W), a metal salt (G, perhaps the precipitate), and water. But when G is heated, perhaps it's a hydroxide that decomposes into oxide and water. But then B would be the oxide, which might have a certain melting point.

Wait, another angle: Let's think about production of CO2. If W is CO2, then the reaction would involve a carbonate or a bicarbonate reacting with an acid. Let's say Y is an acid, perhaps H2SO4 or HCl.

Wait, but the initial reaction is X reacting with Y. If X is a carbonate and Y is an acid, the reaction would be X (like Na2CO3) + Y (like HCl) → 2 NaCl + CO2↑ + H2O. So CO2 is the gas W, NaCl is the precipitate G (if Y is in excess, maybe it's not precipitating; but if X is in excess, perhaps the precipitate is something else).

Alternatively, maybe X is a hydroxide, and Y is an acid. For example, Ca(OH)2 reacting with HCl: Ca(OH)2 + 2 HCl → CaCl2 + 2 H2O. No gas produced here. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe X is a sulfite. Reacting with an acid would produce SO2 gas. But earlier, W's molecule must have same number of protons and neutrons. Let's check for SO2: each S has 16 protons, O has 8. In SO2, total protons: 16 + 2*8 =32. Neutrons for S-32: 16 (since 32-16=16). For O-16: 8 each. So total neutrons: 16 + 2*8= 32. So protons and neutrons are same. So W could be SO2. But I'm not sure if that's the case.

But let's go back to the initial part. The product of a keto acid with X has two O atoms. A keto acid is one where the carbonyl group is adjacent to the carboxylic acid group. For example, acetic acid is a keto acid if it's in a certain form, but more accurately, maybe something like propanoic acid, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is between X and a keto acid, forming something else. If the product has two O atoms, perhaps it's a molecule like H2O? No, that's only one O. Or maybe it's a diol? Or perhaps a dehydration product.

Alternatively, maybe X is an alcohol. For instance, if X is ethanol, and the keto acid is something like acetic acid, then their reaction could be esterification:
