Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to work through it step by step.

The question is asking about the mean decay distance of a meson X. The given parameters are the production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are various distances in meters, so I'm thinking this involves calculating the mean lifetime and then using it to find the decay length.

Wait, I remember that the mean lifetime (τ) of a particle is related to its width Γ by τ = ħ / Γ. But wait, isn't the width Γ the total decay width, which is related to the inverse of the lifetime? So yeah, Γ = ħ / τ → τ = ħ / Γ.

Once I have the lifetime, the mean decay distance would be the particle's velocity (v) multiplied by the lifetime, right? So distance L = v * τ.

But wait, how do I find the velocity of the meson X? Oh, right, I can use the relativistic energy-momentum relation. The production energy is E_X, and the mass is m_X, which gives us the energy and mass to find momentum.

The energy of a relativistic particle is E = γ m c². But I also know that E² = (pc)² + (m c²)². So perhaps I can find the momentum p first.

Let me write down the formula:

E = sqrt(
