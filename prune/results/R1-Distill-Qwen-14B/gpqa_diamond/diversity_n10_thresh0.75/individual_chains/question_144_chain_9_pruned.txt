Okay, so I have this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I don't remember exactly how to approach this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about finding the mean decay distance of a meson called X. The given parameters are production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV.

Wait, I remember that the mean lifetime of a particle is related to its width. The formula I think is τ = ħ / Γ, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant and Γ is the decay width. But wait, decay width is the total width, which is related to the lifetime. Oh right, because Γ is the total decay rate, and lifetime is inversely proportional to that.

So first, I need to calculate the lifetime τ. Once I have τ, I can find the mean decay distance. Decay distance depends on the velocity of the particle and the lifetime. The formula for mean decay length is usually something like L = v * τ * c, where c is the speed of light. Wait, no, I think more accurately, the mean path length (decay length) is L = (v * c) * τ. But wait, I'm a bit confused about the units here. Let me think again.

Alternatively, I've heard of the formula L = (γ * v * c) * (ħ / Γ), where γ is the Lorentz factor. Because the lifetime in the lab frame is longer due to time dilation. Oh right, because the particle is moving
