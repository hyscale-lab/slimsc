Okay, so I'm looking at this question about barley and a gene that produces an anti-nutritional compound. The goal is to find which mutation would eliminate that compound. Hmm.

So the intact gene's DNA sequence is given, and there are four mutants. Each mutant has a change in the first exon area. I remember that exons are the parts of the gene that are transcribed into mRNA and then translated into protein. So any mutations in exons could affect the protein structure.

The question is about which mutation would probably eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. That means the protein probably needs to be altered so it doesn't produce the compound anymore. So I'm thinking about how DNA mutations can affect the protein.

Looking at each mutant:

Mutant 1: The change is in the first exon. Comparing the sequences, the original has CGC, and mutant 1 has CGC as well? Wait, no. Let me look again. Oh wait, no. The intact is ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’.

Wait, the changes are in the first part. Let me look at the exact positions. The first exon has the start codon, so any change early on could affect the protein.

Mutant 1: The sequence is ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA. Comparing to the intact, at position 7-10, the intact has TCTCGCT, I think? Wait, maybe I should compare each character.

Wait, maybe it's easier to look for where each mutant differs. Let's break down the sequences.

Intact: 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Mutant 1: 5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

Looking at the first part. The intact has TTT after ATG (start codon). Mutant 1 has TTC. Wait, ATGTTT vs ATGTTCTA? Hmm, perhaps I should find where the nucleotides change.

Alternatively, let's count the letters. The first part of the intact is ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…

Mutant 1: ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…

So in the first part, the intact has ATGTTT CTCGCT GGA... whereas mutant 1 has ATGTTCT ACGCTGGA...

So the first change is after the start codon. Let me check each position:

1: A (same)
2: T (same)
3: G (same)
4: T (same)
5: T (same)
6: C (in the intact, position 6 is T, in mutant 1, it's C) Oh wait no, wait, perhaps it's better to line them up.

Wait, perhaps the first part is:

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA ...

Mutant1: ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA ...

Wait, I think I'm getting a bit confused. Alternatively, perhaps the way to approach this is to see if any of the mutations result in a premature stop codon, which would truncate the protein, potentially making it nonfunctional and thus eliminating the compound.

Alternatively, a missense mutation that changes an important amino acid could disrupt the function. Alternatively, a nonsense mutation would cause a stop codon, leading to a shorter protein.

Looking for any of the mutants that have a stop codon introduced. The stop codon in DNA is TGA, TAG, or TAA. Wait, but in the mRNA, it's UAA, UAG, UGA.

Wait, but the question provides the DNA sequences. So the DNA has the coding strand given as 5' to 3'. The mRNA is synthesized from the template (non-coding) strand, which is complementary to the coding strand.

So the stop codon in DNA would be complementary to the mRNA stop. For example, the mRNA stop codon TGA (as in the original gene's ending is TGA) corresponds to DNA coding strand as TGA.

Wait, the original gene ends with TGA. So the last part is ...TGA, which would be the stop codon in mRNA as UAC? Wait, no. Wait, the DNA coding strand is the same as the mRNA except T for U.

Wait, the stop codon in mRNA is UAA, UAG, UGA. The DNA coding strand would have TAA, TAG, TGA, respectively.

So, in the original DNA, the sequence is TGA at the end, which would be a stop codon. So in the mutants, if any have a TGA in a different position, creating an earlier stop codon, that could cause a truncated protein.

Looking at the mutants:

Mutant 1: Ends with TGA as well. But let's see earlier parts. Let me look for any TGA in the middle.

Wait, the original gene has TGA at the end. So any TGA elsewhere would be a premature stop.

Looking at the sequences:

Mutant 4: Its sequence is ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’. Wait, the sequence is ATGTTTTACGCTACT... So in the middle, after the start, is there a TGA in the coding sequence?

Wait, the coding strand is the same as the mRNA (except T for U). So, when I look for TGA in the coding strand, that's a stop codon.

Looking at each mutant:

Mutant 1: ...ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC...

Wait, the part after the start is: TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA...

Looking for TGA in the coding strand. In the intact gene, the last part is ...TGA. But in the mutants, is there a TGA before that?

Mutant 1: I don't see a TGA in the middle. The middle has GAT, so the triplet is GAT, which is Asp. So no stop codon.

Mutant 2: 5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’ 

Looking through: ...CTA AGC TGG...

Wait, the sequence after ATG is TTC TAAGC TGGTACT TCT GTG GAT GAA...

The part TAAGC: so in the coding strand, that's part of the mRNA. So the triplet would be GCT (from AGC is part of the triplet?), wait maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps it's better to look for the triplet TGA in the coding strand. So looking through each mutant's sequence:

Mutant 1: Ends with TGA as usual, so no early stop.

Mutant 2: Let's see: the sequence is ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…

So in the middle, perhaps after some point, is there a TGA?

Looking for any triplet TGA. Let's see:

The sequence after ATG is TTC TAAGC TGGTACT TCT GTG GAT GAA...

The part from position 7: TAAGCTGGTA...

Wait, the TAAGCT part: the triplet would be AGC, which is Ser. So no TGA there.

Mutant 3: 5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Looking for TGA in the middle. Let me see: ...ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAA...

So after the start, TTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGA.

Wait, the part TACGCTG would be part of the codons. Let me check for TGA. The sequence has ...TGT CAC T... So no TGA in the middle.

Mutant 4: 5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Looking through: ATG TTTT ACGC TACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...

The part after the start is TTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGAT.

Wait, the triplet ACT in the middle? Or perhaps, is there a TGA anywhere before the end?

Wait, the sequence is ...TACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…

Looking for TGA: in the middle, is there a TGA?

In the middle of the sequence, the part is TAC TTCTGTG GATGAAC...

Wait, the part GATGAAC: the triplet is GAT (Asp) and then GAA (Glu). No TGA in the middle.

Wait a minute, so all the mutants have their own changes, but none of them introduce an early TGA except perhaps one?

Wait, looking again:

Mutant 4: The sequence is ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Wait, the part in the middle is ...TACGCTACT... So the triplet would be CTA (Leu), then CGT (Arg), then ACT (Thr). Hmm, not TGA.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me check each mutant's sequence again.

Wait, perhaps the issue is a frameshift mutation, but I don't think so because the question says that the gene has five exons and four introns, and the mutations are in the first exon. Frameshift would change all downstream codons, but the question says the mutations are in the first exon area, so perhaps the reading frame is preserved.

Alternatively, if a stop codon is introduced earlier, that would truncate the protein.

Looking again:

Intact gene ends with TGA, which is a stop codon.

Mutant 1: Let's look for any TGA before the end.

Wait, the sequence starts with ATG, then TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA... So no TGA in the middle.

Mutant 2: ...CTA AGC TGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC...

Looking for TGA. The part after CTG is GAT GAA. Hmm, no TGA.

Mutant3: ...CTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...

So after ATG, TTTTACGCTG... No TGA in middle.

Mutant4: ...TTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...

Hmm, in the middle, after the start, I see 'ACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT'.

Wait, so the sequence ...TGTGGATGAACAT... So the triplet GAT is Asp, then GAA is Glu, etc. No TGA.

Wait, maybe I'm looking in the wrong place. Or perhaps I should think about which mutation changes a codon into a stop codon.

Another approach: look for any of the mutant sequences that have a TGA appearing early.

Wait, the original gene has TGA at the end. So if in a mutant, the DNA coding sequence has a TGA before that, that would create a premature stop.

Looking again:

Mutant4: 5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Wait, the part after ATG is TTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…

Looking for TGA in the middle. Let's see:

The sequence after the start is TTTT ACGC TAC T... So the triplets would be TTT (Phe), TAC (Tyr), GCT (Ala), etc. No TGA in this part.

Wait, I'm not finding any TGA in the middle of the mutant sequences except the end. Maybe that's not the right approach.

Alternative idea: maybe the mutation leads to a nonfunctional enzyme by disrupting the active site. So perhaps a missense mutation altering a critical amino acid.

But without knowing the exact gene function, this is tricky. Alternatively, perhaps the gene is a structural gene, so a frameshift would disrupt it. But the question states that the mutations are in the first exon; perhaps the reading frame is preserved.

Wait, another thought. The anti-nutritional compound is probably a byproduct of the gene's activity. If the gene is knocked out (nonfunctional), the compound won't be produced.

So which mutation would cause the gene to be nonfunctional? Maybe a nonsense mutation (premature stop) or a frameshift.

Alternatively, a missense mutation that disrupts the enzyme's function.

Wait, let's look at the sequences again.

Looking for any mutations that cause a frameshift. Frameshifts occur due to insertions or deletions of nucleotides that aren't multiples of three. Looking at the options:

Mutant1: Comparing to intact, let's see if the number of nucleotides changed. The first part of intact is ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...

Mutant1 is ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC...

Wait, the length is the same? Let's see: count the number of nucleotides in the given sequences.

Intact: Let's count the letters given.

Intact: 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Assuming the … represents continuation, let's count up to the first few codons.

ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT… TGA

That's 19 codons before the ….

Mutant1: ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC…

So same number of codons as before.

So it's a point mutation, not a frameshift.

Same for the others.

So all the mutations are point mutations.

Now, which point mutation would result in a stop codon being introduced in the middle of the gene?

Looking for any of the mutant sequences that have a TGA in the coding sequence prior to the end.

Wait, let me check each mutant:

Mutant1: 

The sequence after ATG is TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA...

Looking for any TGA triplets. The third codon is TAC (Tyr), fourth is GCT (Ala), fifth is GGT (Gly), sixth ACT (Thr), seventh TCT (Ser), eighth GTG (Val), ninth GAT (Asp), tenth GAA (Glu). No TGA anywhere.

Mutant2:

After ATG, TTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAA...

Wait, the first few codons after ATG are TTC (Phe), then TAAGC TGG (wait, no, the triplet is AGC, which is Ser). Let me see:

ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA...

Wait, the third codon is TAA (Tyr?), no, wait, TAA is a stop codon. Wait, no, TAA in the coding strand would be TAA, but wait, the mRNA is complementary. Wait, wait, no—no, the DNA coding strand is the same as the mRNA, except T for U.

So in the DNA coding strand, a TAA would code for a stop codon in mRNA as UAA. So in Mutant2, the DNA sequence after ATG is TTC TAA GCT GGT ACT... So that would be TTC (Phe), TAA (stop), GCT (Ala), etc.

Oh! So in Mutant2, the third codon after ATG is TAA, which is a stop codon. So this would cause the protein to terminate early. That might disrupt the function of the gene product, possibly preventing the synthesis of the anti-nutritional compound.

So Mutant2's DNA sequence in the coding region has a TAA, which is a stop codon, leading to a truncated protein.

Looking back at the options, Mutant2 is option A.

So the answer would be option A, because the mutation introduces a premature stop codon, likely rendering the protein nonfunctional.


To determine which mutation would most likely eliminate the anti-nutritional compound, we analyze the impact of each mutation on the gene's coding sequence. The anti-nutritional compound is synthesized by the gene's product, so disrupting the gene's function could prevent its production. The mutations are point mutations, and we focus on whether they introduce a premature stop codon or significantly alter the protein structure.

### Key Analysis of Each Mutant:
1. **Mutant 1**:  
   The sequence is `ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA`.  
   Comparing to the intact gene, there are no changes that introduce a premature stop codon (TGA, TAG, or TAA) before the natural stop codon at the end. This mutation likely results in a missense mutation, altering the protein but not completely eliminating its function.

2. **Mutant 2**:  
   The sequence is `ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA`.  
   After the start codon (ATG), the third codon is `TAA`, which is a stop codon (TAA in DNA corresponds to UAA in mRNA). This introduces a premature stop codon, leading to a truncated protein. A truncated protein is likely nonfunctional, which would prevent the synthesis of the anti-nutritional compound.

3. **Mutant 3**:  
   The sequence is `ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA`.  
   There are no premature stop codons introduced in the coding sequence. This mutation likely causes a missense mutation, altering the protein but not completely eliminating its function.

4. **Mutant 4**:  
   The sequence is `ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA`.  
   There are no premature stop codons introduced in the coding sequence. This mutation likely causes a missense mutation, altering the protein but not completely eliminating its function.

### Conclusion:
Among the mutants, **Mutant 2** introduces a premature stop codon (`TAA`) early in the coding sequence, leading to a truncated and likely nonfunctional protein. This would prevent the synthesis of the anti-nutritional compound. None of the other mutants introduce a premature stop codon, so they are less likely to completely eliminate the compound.
