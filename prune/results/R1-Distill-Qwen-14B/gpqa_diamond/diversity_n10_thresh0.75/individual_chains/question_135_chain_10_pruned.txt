Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a boson field X. Hmm, let me try to think through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let's see.

The problem states that the interaction Lagrangian is given by L(y) = -λf f(y)(ῡ + X(y))ψ_f(y). Wait, I'm not sure I remember the notation exactly, but I think it's something to do with fermions interacting with the boson X. The mass of X is 6 GeV, and we need to find the kinematically allowed decays at the lowest order.

So, first, I think I need to figure out which fermions can be produced by the decay of X. Since X is a boson, it would decay into fermion-antifermion pairs. The possible decay products depend on the mass of X and the masses of the fermions. Oh, right, the mass of X has to be at least twice the mass of the fermion for the decay to be possible because you need enough energy to create the pair.

Wait, but what fermions are we considering here? The options include various quarks and leptons. Let me list their masses. I remember that quarks have different masses, but sometimes the masses can vary a lot. For instance, the top quark is super heavy, around 173 GeV, but others are lighter. Let's see:

- Up quark (u): very light, maybe around a few MeV.
- Down quark (d): also light, similar to u.
- Strange quark (s): about 100 MeV or so.
- Charm quark (c): around 1.5 GeV.
- Bottom quark (b): maybe 4.5 GeV?
- Top quark (t): way too heavy at 173 GeV.
- For leptons: electrons (e) are about 0.5 MeV, muons (mu) around 105 MeV, taus (tau) are about 1.78 GeV.

So the mass of X is 6 GeV. Let's see which fermion pairs are possible.

Each decay would produce a pair, like f and f-bar. So, the sum of the masses of f and f-bar must be less than or equal to 6 GeV. Since each f has mass m, the sum is 2m. So 2m ≤ 6 GeV → m ≤ 3 GeV.

So any fermion with mass less than or equal to 3 GeV can be produced. Let me check each possibility.

Electron (e-): m ~ 0.5 MeV → definitely allowed. So e+ e- is possible.

Muon (mu): m ~ 105 MeV → also allowed. So mu+ mu- is okay.

Tau (tau): m ~ 1.78 GeV → 2m is about 3.56 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV? Wait, 1.78 *2= 3.56 GeV, which is less than 6, so yes, tau+
