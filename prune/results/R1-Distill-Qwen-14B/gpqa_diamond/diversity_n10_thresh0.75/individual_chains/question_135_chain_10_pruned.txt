Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about the decay channels of a boson, X, which has a mass of 6 GeV. The interaction Lagrangian is given, and I need to figure out which decay options are kinematically allowed at the lowest order.

First, I remember that when a particle decays, the total energy of the decay products must be less than or equal to the mass of the decaying particle. So the mass of X is 6 GeV, and whatever it decays into must have a combined mass less than or equal to that.

Looking at the Lagrangian, it's written as L(y) = -λ f \bar{ψ}_f (y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, wait, that looks a bit confusing. I think I need to parse it correctly. Oh right, the interaction term would be something like λ f X ψ_f in terms of the fields. So the boson X is interacting with fermions, specifically the fermion field ψ_f, which I think represents different types like quarks or leptons.

The interaction term implies that X can couple to fermions. So for decay, X can split into a pair of fermions, right? So X → f f̄. But which fermions can it decay into?

The possible fermions include quarks and leptons. Now, considering the masses of these fermions. Since X is 6 GeV, the fermions that can be produced must have a mass such that 2m_f ≤ 6 GeV. Because each fermion and its antiparticle must each have a rest mass less than or equal to half the X mass.

Wait, wait. Wait, actually, when a boson with mass M decays into two fermions, each fermion can have a mass up to M/2. So let's list the masses of the known fermions:

- Up and down quarks (u, d): their masses are around a few MeV. So definitely much less than 3 GeV.
- Strange quark (s): mass is about 100 MeV, still way under.
- Charm quark (c): mass is around 1.5 GeV. So 2m_c would be about 3 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV. So c quarks are possible.
- Bottom quark (b): mass is around 4.5 GeV. So 2m_b would be about 9 GeV, which is more than 6 GeV. So b quarks can't be produced because 2m_b is 9 GeV. So X can't decay into b b̄ because that would require at least 9 GeV.

Similarly, for leptons:
- Electron (e): mass ~0.0005 GeV. So negligible.
- Muon (μ): mass ~0.1 GeV. Again, 2mμ is 0.2 GeV, way under 6 GeV. So X can decay into μ+ μ-.
- Tau (τ): mass is about 1.78 GeV. So 2mτ is ~3.56 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV. So τ+ τ- is allowed.

Wait, wait, wait. Wait, let me calculate 2m each for the fermions.

Let me list the quarks and their masses (approximate):

u: ~2 MeV → 2m_u ≈ 4 MeV → way under 6 GeV
d: ~5 MeV → 2m_d ≈10 MeV → okay
s: ~100 MeV → 2m_s ≈ 200 MeV → okay
c: ~1.3 GeV → 2m_c ≈ 2.6 GeV → okay
b: ~4.5 GeV → 2m_b ≈9 GeV → over 6 GeV, so not allowed.

For leptons:

e: ~0.0005 GeV → 2m_e ≈ 0.001 GeV → okay
μ: ~0.105 GeV → 2mμ ≈ 0.21 GeV → okay
τ: ~1.777 GeV → 2mτ ≈3.554 GeV → okay.

So X can decay into any fermion pair as long as 2m_f ≤6 GeV. So that includes all quarks up to charm, and all leptons except maybe the tau? Wait, no, tau's
