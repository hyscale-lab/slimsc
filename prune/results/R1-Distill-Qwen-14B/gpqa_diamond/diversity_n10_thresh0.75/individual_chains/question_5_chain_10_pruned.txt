Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator, specifically the spin operator for a muon along an arbitrary direction. 

Alright, so the operator is P, and it's given in terms of its X, Y, and Z components. Each component is a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2. I remember that in quantum mechanics, spin operators are represented by these Pauli matrices multiplied by ħ/2. So, P_x is (ħ/2) times the sigma_x matrix, P_y similarly, and P_z is sigma_z scaled by ħ/2.

The problem says I need to find the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. Eigenvectors are vectors that only change by a scalar factor when the operator is applied. So, the operator P acting on this eigenvector gives (ħ/2) times the eigenvector.

Wait, but the operator is along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. Oh, right, so the direction is arbitrary but lies in the x-z plane, which means the direction vector n has components (sinθ cosφ, 0, sinθ sinφ), but since it's in x-z, φ is zero. So, n is along the x-z plane, meaning the direction can be represented as (sinθ, 0, cosθ) or something like that. Or maybe (cosθ, 0, sinθ), I'm not entirely sure about the exact parametrization, but it's in the x-z plane so the y-component is zero.

The operator P is along n. So, the operator is actually the dot product of the vector P (which has components P_x, P_y, P_z) with the direction vector n. That is, P = n · (P_x, P_y, P_z) = n_x P_x + n_y P_y +n_z P_z. But wait, since n is in the x-z plane, n_y is zero. So P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

Hmm, so substituting in the values, n_x is something like sinθ, n_z is cosθ, perhaps. So, the operator is sinθ * (ħ/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]] + cosθ * (ħ/2) * [[1,0],[0,-1]]. Let me compute that matrix.

Let me denote σ_x as [[0,1],[1,0]], and σ_z as [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So, the operator becomes (ħ/2)[ sinθ σ_x + cosθ σ_z ].

So, the matrix is (ħ/2) * [ [cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ] ].

Wait, let me compute that again. σ_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], so sinθ σ_x is [[0, sinθ],[sinθ, 0]]. σ_z is [[1,0],[0,-1]], so cosθ σ_z is [[cosθ, 0],[0, -cosθ]]. Adding these two matrices, the result is [[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ]].
