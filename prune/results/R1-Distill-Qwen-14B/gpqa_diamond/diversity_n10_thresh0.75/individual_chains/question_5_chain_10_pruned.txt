Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem to solve, and I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to think through it step by step. The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. 

Hmm, wait, the operator P is given in terms of its components Px, Py, and Pz. Each of these is a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2. So the operator P must be a vector operator, and each component is a Pauli matrix multiplied by ħ/2. Let me write down what each component is.

Px is (ħ/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]]
Py is (ħ/2) * [[0,-i],[i,0]]
Pz is (ħ/2) * [[1,0],[0,-1]]

Right, these look like the Pauli matrices multiplied by ħ/2. So the operator P is actually the vector operator where each component is (ħ/2) times the corresponding Pauli matrix. That makes sense.

Now, the operator in question is along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. So direction n is in the x-z plane, which means its y-component is zero. So the direction vector can be written as n = (sinθ, 0, cosθ), where θ is the angle from the z-axis, I think. Because in spherical coordinates, θ is the polar angle. So the direction is in the x-z plane, so φ is either 0 or π, but since it's arbitrary along x-z, perhaps the eigenvector will depend on θ.

Wait, but the operator P is a vector operator. The operator P·n would be the component of P in the direction n. So the operator we're considering is P·n, which is the sum of each component multiplied by the corresponding direction cosine.

So P·n = Px * (n_x) + Py * (n_y) + Pz * (n_z)

Since n is in the x-z plane, n_y = 0, so Py term drops out. So,

P·n = (ħ/2) [ n_x σx + n_z σz ]

Where σx and σz are the Pauli matrices for x and z. Let me write that out.

n_x is sinθ, n_z is cosθ because the direction vector in x-z plane would have x-component sinθ and z-component cosθ. So,

P·n = (ħ/2) [ sinθ * [[0,1],[1,0]] + cosθ * [[1,0],[0,-1]] ]

Let me compute this matrix:

The first term, sinθ * [[0,1],[1,0]], gives [[0, sinθ], [sinθ, 0]]
The second term, cosθ * [[1,0],[0,-1]], gives [[cosθ, 0], [0, -cosθ]]
Adding them together:

[[ cosθ, sinθ ],
 [ sinθ, -cosθ ] ]

Multiply by ħ/2, so the matrix is (ħ/2) times that.

Wait, no, because each component P is (ħ/2) times the Pauli matrix, so when we combine them, the overall factor is still (ħ/2). So the operator P·n is:

(ħ/2) * [ [cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ] ]

Now, we need to find the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. So the eigenvalue equation is:

(P·n) |v> = (ħ/2) |v>

Wait, wait, no. Wait, the eigenvalue equation is (P·n) |v> = λ |v>, and we're told λ is +ħ/2.

So let me set up the matrix equation.

Let me denote the matrix as (ħ/2) * M, where M is [[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ]]

So the equation is (ħ/2 M) |v> = (ħ/2) |v>

We can factor out (ħ/2), so:

M |v> = |v>

So we're looking for eigenvectors of M corresponding to eigenvalue 1.

So the matrix M is:

[ [cosθ, sinθ],
  [sinθ, -cosθ] ]

We need to find the eigenvectors for eigenvalue 1.

To find the eigenvectors, we solve (M - I) |v> = 0.

So M - I is:

[ [cosθ -1, sinθ],
  [sinθ, -cosθ -1] ]

The determinant of (M - I) must be zero for non-trivial solutions.

Compute the determinant:

(cosθ -1)(-cosθ -1) - (sinθ)(sinθ) = 0

Let me compute that:

= [ (cosθ -1)(-cosθ -1) ] - sin²θ 

Expand the first term:

(cosθ)(-cosθ) + cosθ (-1) -1*(-cosθ) -1*(-1) 

= -cos²θ - cosθ + cosθ + 1 

Wait, that's expanding (a - b)(c - d), but perhaps it's faster to multiply it as:

(cosθ -1)(-cosθ -1) = -(cosθ)(cosθ) - cosθ*(-1) -1*(-cosθ) -1*(-1)

Wait, perhaps using (a + b)(c + d) = ac + ad + bc + bd. Let me set a = cosθ, b = -1, c = -cosθ, d = -1.

Wait, no, let me think of (cosθ -1)(-cosθ -1) = -(cosθ -1)(cosθ + 1)

= -( [cosθ]^2 - (1)^2 ) [because (a-b)(a+b) = a² - b² ]

So that's -(cos²θ - 1) = -( -sin²θ ) = sin²θ.

So the determinant is:

sin²θ - sin²θ = 0.

Which is correct because the matrix M is Hermitian and has eigenvalues 1 and -1, so when we set up M - I, the determinant is zero.

So the equation is (M - I) |v> = 0, which gives two equations:

(cosθ -1) v1 + sinθ v2 = 0  
sinθ v1 + (-cosθ -1) v2 = 0 

Let me write the first equation:

(cosθ -1) v1 + sinθ v2 = 0 

We can express v2 in terms of v1. Let's solve for v2:

v2 = [ (1 - cosθ) / sinθ ] v1 

But wait, we should be careful with division by sinθ. Let's see if sinθ is zero.

If sinθ is zero, then θ is 0 or π. Let's consider that case later. For now, assuming sinθ ≠ 0.

So v2 = (1 - cosθ)/sinθ * v1 

We can write (1 - cosθ) as 2 sin²(theta/2), and sinθ = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2).

So (1 - cosθ)/sinθ = [2 sin²(theta/2)] / [2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2)] ] = [sin(theta/2)]/[cos(theta/2)] = tan(theta/2)

So v2 = tan(theta/2) * v1 

So the eigenvector can be written as [v1, tan(theta/2) v1]^T. We can factor out v1, so the eigenvector is proportional to [1, tan(theta/2)].

But we need to normalize it. Let's compute the normalization condition: |v1|^2 + |v2|^2 = 1.

v1 is any scalar, so let's set v1 = 1, then v2 = tan(theta/2).

So the vector is [1, tan(theta/2)].

But wait, since quantum states are defined up to a scalar, let's pick the normalization such that the vector has unit length.

Compute the normalization factor:

|1|^2 + |tan(theta/2)|^2 = 1 + tan^2(theta/2) = sec^2(theta/2) 

So the normalized vector is [1 / sqrt(1 + tan^2(theta/2)), tan(theta/2) / sqrt(1 + tan^2(theta/2)) ] 

Which simplifies to [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Wait, because 1/sqrt(1 + tan^2 x) = cos x, and tan x / sqrt(1 + tan^2 x) = sin x.

So the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

But wait, let me check: when theta is 0, this would be [1, 0], which makes sense, because the eigenstate for Pz=+ħ/2 is [1, 0]. Similarly, when theta is π, it would be [0,1], which is the eigenstate for Pz=-ħ/2, but since our eigenvalue is +ħ/2, perhaps I made a mistake here.

Wait, no, because when theta is 0, the direction is along z, and the eigenvector is [1,0], which is correct for eigenvalue +ħ/2.

Wait, but let's think again about the matrix M
