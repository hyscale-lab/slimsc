Okay, so I have this question about density matrices and their geometrical position in qubit space. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The density matrix given is ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). Wait, I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's mixed. So this ρ must represent a mixed state.

Let me write down the matrix form of ρ. I know that |0⟩⟨0| is a diagonal matrix with 1s in the (0,0) position and 0s elsewhere. Similarly, |1⟩⟨1| has 1 in (1,1). So, adding them together would give a 2x2 identity matrix, I think. Then, multiplying by 1/2, ρ becomes (1/2) * I, where I is the identity matrix.

So ρ is a diagonal matrix with 1/2 and 1/2 on the diagonal. That makes sense because it's a completely mixed state. In a qubit system, the density matrix can be represented in a 2D space, but how does this relate to geometrical positions?

Wait, I remember that qubit states can be visualized on the Bloch sphere. Each density matrix corresponds to a point on this sphere, right? For a pure state |ψ⟩⟨ψ|, the corresponding point is on the surface of the Bloch sphere. But for a mixed state, it's inside.

So this ρ is a mixed state. But where exactly? The identity matrix when multiplied by 1/2 would correspond to the completely mixed state. The Bloch vector for a mixed state is given by something like r = (x, y, z), and the density matrix can be written as (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices.

Wait, let's see. The general form for a single qubit density matrix is (I + r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z)/2. So if our ρ is (I)/2, that means all the r_x, r_y, r_z terms are zero. So the vector r would be (0,0,0). Because when r is zero, the density matrix is (I + 0)/2 = I/2.

So the position in the qubit space is (0,0,0). Looking at the options, option C is (0,0,0). So the answer should be C.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents a mixed state. Writing it in matrix form, we see that it is equivalent to 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} = \frac{1}{2} I,
\]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix. This is the completely mixed state for a single qubit.

In the Bloch sphere representation, the density matrix of a single qubit can be expressed as 

\[
\rho = \frac{I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}}{2},
\]

where \(\mathbf{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z)\) is the Bloch vector, and \(\boldsymbol{\sigma}\) represents the Pauli matrices. For the given density matrix, since there are no terms involving the Pauli matrices (\(r_x = 0\), \(r_y = 0\), \(r_z = 0\)), the Bloch vector is \(\mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0)\). This corresponds to the completely mixed state at the origin of the Bloch sphere.

Among the options provided, the correct geometrical position in the qubit space is:

**A) r=(1,1,0)**  
**B) r=(0,0,1)**  
**C) r=(0,0,0)**  
**D) r=(1,1,1)**  

The correct answer is **C) r=(0,0,0)**.

Answer: C
