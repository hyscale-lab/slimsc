Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. The question is about equilibrium temperatures of exoplanets discovered using the TTV method, which I think stands for transit timing variation. But I'm more focused on the part about their orbital periods and finding the temperature ratio between two planets.

The problem states that there are five exoplanets in orbital resonance with orbital periods in the ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. They all have the same albedo, which I remember is the measure of how much light that hits a planet is reflected. Since they have the same albedo, that part might not complicate things. The question is about the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2.

Hmm, equilibrium temperature... I recall that a planet's equilibrium temperature depends on its distance from the star and its albedo. The formula, I think, is something like T = T_star * ( (L / (1 - a)) )^(1/4), but wait, no, that's probably for a star's effect. Oh wait, the formula for a planet's equilibrium temperature is T = T_eff * ( (R / (2D)) )^(1/2), but maybe I'm mixing things up.

Wait, no, more accurately, the equilibrium temperature is given by the formula:

T = T_sun * sqrt( R_sun / (2 D) ) * ( (1 - A) / (1 + e) )^(1/4 )

But wait, since the planets are in circular orbits, the eccentricity e is zero. So that simplifies to (1 - A)^(1/4), but since all planets have the same albedo A, that term cancels out when taking the ratio. So when comparing Planet 4 and Planet 2, the albedo won't affect the ratio because A is same for both.

So then, the main factor is their distance from the star. But how does the orbital period relate to the distance? Oh right, Kepler's third law comes into play here. Because for a circular orbit, the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (which is the distance for circular orbits).

So, Kepler's law: (P^2) ∝ (a^3) / M_star, assuming M_star is much larger than the planet's mass, which it is. But since all planets are orbiting the same star, the mass is the same for all, so P^2 ∝ a^3.

Wait, but we're given the ratios of their periods. Let me note down the period ratios:

Planet_1 : Planet_2 : Planet_3 : Planet_4 : Planet_5 = 1 : 2 : 2.5 : 3.5 :5.

So, the ratio is 1 (for Planet_1), 2 (Planet_2), 2.5 (P3), 3.5 (P4), and 5 (P5). So Planet_2 has a period twice that of P1, Planet_4's period is 3.5 times that of P1.

But since P^2 is proportional to a^3, so a ∝ P^(2/3).

So, the ratio of the distances a for each planet is the cube root of the square of the period ratio.

Wait more precisely, for each planet, a_i = k * P_i^(2/3), where k is a constant.

So, the ratio of the distances, a4/a2 = (P4/P2)^(2/3).

Because a ∝ P^(2/3).

Wait, no, let's think again: P^2 ∝ a^3 → a ∝ P^(2/3). So for Planet_4, a4 = (P4^(2/3)) * k, where k is the same for all planets because they share the same star. So when taking a4/a2, the k cancels.

So a4/a2 = (P4/P2)^(2/3).

Given that Planet_4's period is 3.5, and Planet_2's is 2. So P4/P2 = 3.5 / 2 = 1.75.

So a4 = a2 * (1.75)^(2/3).

Wait, no, the ratio a4/a2 is (3.5 / 2)^(2/3). Let me compute that.

Wait, 3.5 is 7/2, so 3.5/2 = 7/4 = 1.75.

So 1.75 raised to the power of 2/3. Hmm, what's 1.75^(2/3)? Let me think of it as (7/4)^(2/3).

Another approach: 1.75 is 7/4, which is (7/4) = 1.75. Let me compute (7/4)^(1/3) first. The cube root of 7 is about 1.913, cube root of 4 is about 1.587. So 1.913/1.587 ≈ 1.208. So (7/4)^(1/3) ≈ 1.208. Then square that for the 2/3 power: 1.208^2 ≈ 1.459.

So a4 is approximately 1.459 times a2. So the distance of Planet_4 is about 1.459 times that of Planet_2.

Wait, but wait, equilibrium temperature depends on the distance. Since the planet further away is colder, right? Because equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the distance. Because the formula is T = T_star * ( (1 - A) )^(1/4) * ( L / (16 π D^2 σ) )^(1/4 ), but perhaps another approach is better.

Wait, the equilibrium temperature is given by the formula:

T_planet = T_star * ( ( R_star ) / (2 D) )^(1/2) * ( (1 - A) )^(1/4 )

But since all planets are around the same star, R_star and T_star are the same. Also, A is the same. So the only varying factor is D, the distance from the star. So T ∝ 1 / sqrt(D).

Wait, so T is inversely proportional to sqrt(D). So if Planet_4 is D4 away and Planet_2 is D2 away, then T4/T2 = sqrt( D2 / D4 )

Wait, no. Because T is inversely proportional to sqrt(D), so T ∝ (1/√D). So T4 is proportional to 1/√D4, T2 proportional to 1/√D2. So the ratio T4/T2 = (1/√D4) / (1/√D2) ) = sqrt(D2/D4).

Alternatively, since D4 is the distance of Planet_4, and D2 is that of Planet_2.

Wait, but earlier we found that a4 = D4, since it's the semi-major axis, and the distance for a circular orbit is the same as semi-major axis. So the distance ratio is D4/D2 = (P4/P2)^(2/3)

Wait, earlier I calculated a4/a2 = (3.5/2)^(2/3) ≈ 1.459. So D4 = 1.459 * D2.

So the ratio T4/T2 = sqrt( D2 / D4 ) = sqrt( 1 / 1.459 ) = 1 / sqrt(1.459).

What's sqrt(1.459)? Let's calculate that.

1.459 is approximately between 1.4^2=1.96 and 1.2^2=1.44. Wait, 1.2^2 is 1.44, 1.21^2 is 1.4641. Oh wait, 1.21^2 is 1.4641, which is just over 1.459. So sqrt(1.459) ≈ 1.208 (since 1.208^2 = approx 1.459).

So sqrt(1.459) ≈ 1.208.

So 1 / 1.208 ≈ 0.828.

Wait, but wait, T4 is Planet_4's temperature, T2 is Planet_2's. So the ratio T4/T2 is 0.828, which is approximately 0.83.

Looking at the options, option C is ~0.83. So the answer would be C.

But let me double-check my steps to be sure.

1. Orbital periods are in ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. So for Planet_4, P4=3.5, Planet_2 P2=2.

2. Using Kepler's third law: P^2 ∝ a^3 → a ∝ P^(2/3)

3. So a4/a2 = (3.5/2)^(2/3) → (7/4)^(2/3). Calculated this as approximately 1.459.

4. D4 = 1.459 * D2. So the distance ratio D4/D2 is ~1.459.

5. Equilibrium temperature T is inversely proportional to sqrt(D): T ∝ 1/√D.

6. So T4/T2 = sqrt( D2 / D4 ) = sqrt(1 / 1.459) ≈ sqrt(0.686) → since 0.69^2 is about 0.476, wait no. Wait, sqrt(0.686) is approximately 0.828, which is ~0.83.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

Let me compute (3.5/2)^(2/3) exactly. 3.5 is 7/2, so 7/2 divided by 2 is 7/4. So (7/4) is 1.75. So 1.75^(2/3). Let me compute that.

Alternatively, taking logarithms: ln(1.75) ≈ 0.5596. Multiply by 2/3: 0.5596 * 0.6667 ≈ 0.373. Exponentiate: e^0.373 ≈ 1.452.

So a4/a2 ≈ 1.452. So D4/D2 is approximately 1.452, so D2/D4 ≈ 0.688.

sqrt(D2/D4) = sqrt(0.688) ≈ 0.829. So T4 is about 0.829 times T2. So T4/T2 is approximately 0.829, which is ~0.83.

So the correct answer should be option C) ~0.83.


To determine the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2, we start by analyzing the given orbital period ratios: 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. Using Kepler's third law, the semi-major axis \(a\) of a planet's orbit is proportional to the cube root of the square of its orbital period (\(a \propto P^{2/3}\)). 

For Planet_4 and Planet_2, their orbital periods are \(P_4 = 3.5\) and \(P_2 = 2\), respectively. The ratio of their distances from the star is:

\[
\frac{a_4}{a_2} = \left(\frac{P_4}{P_2}\right)^{2/3} = \left(\frac{3.5}{2}\right)^{2/3}.
\]

Simplifying \(3.5 / 2 = 1.75\), we compute \(1.75^{2/3}\). Taking the natural logarithm, \(\ln(1.75) \approx 0.5596\), multiplying by \(2/3\) gives \(\ln(1.75^{2/3}) \approx 0.373\). Exponentiating, \(e^{0.373} \approx 1.452\). Thus, \(a_4 / a_2 \approx 1.452\), meaning \(D_4 / D_2 \approx 1.452\).

The equilibrium temperature of a planet is inversely proportional to the square root of its distance from the star (\(T \propto 1/\sqrt{D}\)). Therefore, the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2 is:

\[
\frac{T_4}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{D_2}{D_4}} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{1.452}}.
\]

Calculating \(\sqrt{1/1.452}\), we find \(\sqrt{0.688} \approx 0.829\). Thus, \(T_4 / T_2 \approx 0.83\).

From the given options, the closest match is:

**A) ~0.57**  
**B) ~0.69**  
**C) ~0.83**  
**D) ~0.75**

The correct answer is **C) ~0.83**.
