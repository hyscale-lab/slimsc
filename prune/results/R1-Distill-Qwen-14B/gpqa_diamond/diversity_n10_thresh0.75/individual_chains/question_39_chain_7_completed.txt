Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let me try to think it through. So, the setup is that there are 10,000 identical systems, each with a particle moving along a tube, which is the x-axis. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i, where i is the square root of -1. Oh wait, but when they measure the position of the particles, none are found outside the region x=1 to x=3. So, the wave function must be zero outside this interval, right?

Wait, no, the question says when measuring, particles are only found between x=1 and x=3. So that suggests that the wave function must be zero elsewhere. Or maybe it's non-zero but the probability is zero outside that region? Hmm.

Wait, the wave function given is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. But that doesn't look like a standard form. Normally, wave functions are complex, but when we square the modulus, that gives the probability density. Oh wait, but for normal wave functions, the wave function must be normalized so that the total probability is 1.

But wait, looking at the wave function, it's a function of x. The real part is a/(sqrt(1+x)), and the imaginary part is 0.5i. So the wave function is ψ(x) = [a/(sqrt(1+x))] + (-0.5i). So it's a complex function.

But I remember that for a wave function to be normalizable, the integral of |ψ(x)|² dx over all space must be 1. Also, the problem states that the particles are found only between x=1 and x=3, implying that the wave function is zero elsewhere. Or does it? Wait, the wave function given is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So, that's a complex function, but if the wave function must be zero outside x=1 to 3, then this function must be zero outside that interval. Wait, but the given function doesn't seem to have any factors that would make it zero beyond x=1 or x=3. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the setup.

Wait, perhaps the wave function is non-zero only between x=1 and x=3. So, ψ(x) is zero for x < 1 and x > 3. But the expression given is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. That can't be zero except if a/sqrt(1+x) equals 0.5 and i equals i, but that doesn't make sense because a is a constant. So, perhaps the wave function is only defined in that region, and zero elsewhere. So the wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i between x=1 and x=3, and zero otherwise.

Wait, but the problem states that the wave function is in a part of space where the particle can exist. So maybe the given wave function is for x between 1 and 3, and zero elsewhere. So, the wave function is non-zero between x=1 and x=3, and zero otherwise.

So, the normalization condition would be the integral from x=1 to x=3 of |ψ(x)|² dx equals 1.

So let's compute |ψ(x)|². Since ψ(x) = [a/sqrt(1+x)] + (-0.5i), then ψ*(x) is [a/sqrt(1+x)] - (-0.5i). So, ψ*(x) = a/sqrt(1+x) + 0.5i. Multiplying ψ and ψ*, we get |ψ|² = [a/sqrt(1+x)]² + (0.5)^2. Because the cross terms would involve i and -i, which would cancel out when taking the product. Wait, no, more accurately, when you multiply (a/sqrt(1+x) - 0.5i) by (a/sqrt(1+x) + 0.5i), it's like (A - Bi)(A + Bi) = A² + B². So yes, |ψ|² is (a²/(1+x)) + (0.5)^2.

So the integral from 1 to 3 of [a²/(1+x) + 0.25] dx must equal 1.

Let me set up the integral:

Integral from 1 to 3 of [ (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx = 1.

We can split this into two integrals:

Integral of (a²)/(1+x) dx from 1 to3 + Integral of 0.25 dx from1 to3 = 1.

Compute first integral: a² ∫ (1/(1+x)) dx from 1 to3.

∫1/(1+x) dx is ln(1+x). Evaluated from 1 to3: ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(2).

So first integral is a² * ln(2).

Second integral: 0.25*(3-1) = 0.25 *2 = 0.5.

So adding together:

a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So a² ln(2) = 0.5 → a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

Compute ln(2) is approximately 0.6931.

So 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

So a² ≈0.7213 → a ≈ sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849. Hmm, looking at the options, option B is 0.85, which is close.

Wait, but let me double-check.

Wait, wait a second. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i. But for x between 1 and 3, that's the form. So when I compute |ψ(x)|², it's [a/(sqrt(1+x))]^2 + (0.5)^2. Because the real part is a/(sqrt(1+x)), the imaginary part is -0.5. So when I take modulus squared, it's (a^2)/(1+x) + (0.5)^2.

So the integral from 1 to 3 of [a²/(1+x) + 0.25] dx =1.

Yes, that's correct.

So the integral becomes a² ln(2) + 0.5 =1 → a² ln(2)=0.5 → a²=0.5/(ln2) → a= sqrt(0.5/(ln2)).

Compute 0.5 is 0.5, ln2 ~ 0.6931.

So 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

sqrt(0.7213) is about 0.849, which is approximately 0.85. So the answer would be B) 0.85.

Wait, but let me think again. Could I have made a mistake in the setup? Because sometimes in such problems, the wave function is given as a real function, but here it's complex. Oh, but the problem doesn't specify whether the wave function is real, so it's allowed to be complex. But the modulus squared is what matters for probability.

Wait, but perhaps the wave function is only non-zero between x=1 and x=3, and zero elsewhere. So the wave function is (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i in that interval, and zero otherwise. So the integral of |ψ|^2 over all x is 1. So the calculation I did is correct.

Another thought: when integrating modulus squared, perhaps I should think about the real and imaginary parts. So, ψ is [a/(sqrt(1+x))] + (-0.5i). So ψ* is [a/(sqrt(1+x))] + 0.5i. Then, ψ*ψ is (a^2)/(1+x) + (0.5 i)(-0.5 i) *something? Wait, no: the product would be [a/(sqrt(1+x))]^2 + [ (a/(sqrt(1+x)))(0.5i) ) - (0.5i)(a/(sqrt(1+x))) ) ] + (0.5i)(-0.5i). Wait, perhaps I should compute it more carefully.

Wait, wait, no. The modulus squared of a complex number z = a + ib is z*z* = (a + ib)(a - ib) = a² + b². So for ψ(x)=A + iB, |ψ|² = A² + B². So in this case, A is a/(sqrt(1+x)), and B is -0.5. So B² is (0.5)^2 = 0.25.

So yes, |ψ|² is (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25. So the integral is correct.

Thus, the earlier calculation should hold. So the value of a is approximately 0.85, which is option B.


To solve the problem, we start by analyzing the given wave function:

\[
\psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i
\]

The wave function is non-zero only between \(x=1\) and \(x=3\), as particles are not found outside this region. The normalization condition requires that the total probability is 1, which means:

\[
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} |\psi(x)|^2 dx = 1
\]

Since \(\psi(x)\) is zero outside \(x=1\) to \(x=3\), the integral simplifies to:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} |\psi(x)|^2 dx = 1
\]

The modulus squared of the wave function is:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25
\]

Thus, the normalization condition becomes:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1
\]

This integral can be split into two parts:

1. \(\int_{1}^{3} \frac{a^2}{1+x} dx\)
2. \(\int_{1}^{3} 0.25 dx\)

For the first integral, we use the substitution \(u = 1+x\), so \(du = dx\). The limits of integration change accordingly:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} \frac{a^2}{1+x} dx = a^2 \int_{2}^{4} \frac{1}{u} du = a^2 \ln(u) \Big|_{2}^{4} = a^2 \ln(4) - a^2 \ln(2) = a^2 \ln(2)
\]

For the second integral:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} 0.25 dx = 0.25 \cdot (3-1) = 0.5
\]

Adding the two results, the normalization condition becomes:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1
\]

Solving for \(a^2\):

\[
a^2 \ln(2) = 0.5 \implies a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}
\]

Using \(\ln(2) \approx 0.6931\):

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7213
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
a \approx \sqrt{0.7213} \approx 0.849
\]

This value is closest to the option \(a = 0.85\). Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: B**
