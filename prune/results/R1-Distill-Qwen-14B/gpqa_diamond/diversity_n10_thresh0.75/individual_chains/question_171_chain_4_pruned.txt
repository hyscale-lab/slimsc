Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about electrophilic substitution reactions with bromine. Hmm, I need to arrange six substances in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

First, let me remember what factors influence the para substitution in electrophilic aromatic substitution. The directing groups on the benzene ring play a big role. If a substituent is meta-directing, the incoming electrophile tends to add in the meta position, while para-directing groups lead the electrophile to the para position. Also, activating groups make the ring more reactive, while deactivating groups make it less reactive, affecting the reaction rate.

But wait, the question is about the weight fraction of the para-isomer. So even if a substituent is meta-directing, some para substitution might still occur, but not as much as with a para-directing group. For example, nitro groups are meta-directing and deactivating, so they would direct incoming groups to the meta position, but maybe a little para as well. Whereas groups like -Cl or -NO2 which are para/ortho directors would lead to more para substitution.

Wait, no, wait. Let me correct that. The directing effects are either ortho-para or meta. So substituents with +I (inductive effect) or -M (mesomeric effect) might influence this. 

Let me list the substituents for each compound:

1) C6H5-CH3: The substituent is a methyl group (-CH3). Methyl is an activating, ortho/para-directing group.

2) C6H5-CO-O-C2H5: That's a benzoyloxyethyl group? Wait no, it's C6H5-CO-O-C2H5, so the substituent is a COOEt group. So it's a carbonyloxy ethyl ester. Wait, actually, the group is a benzoyl ester? No, the structure is benzene ring with a COOEt group attached. So the substituent is a -COOEt (ester group). Esters are meta-directing because they are deactivating (due to the electron-withdrawing ester group). So the substituent is deactivating and meta-directing.

3) C6H5-Cl: The substituent
