Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about vector fields and integrals. Hmm, I remember that vector calculus involves things like divergence and gradients. Let me see what the question is asking.

The problem says that there's a vector field f(r) which falls off radially as 1/r². So the magnitude is f(r) = 1/r², and the field only has a radial component in spherical coordinates. I need to evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of this field inside a sphere of radius R centered at the origin.

Wait, the question is about ∇ · f. Right, the divergence of a vector field. So I should find the divergence of f and then integrate it over the volume of the sphere.

I think the divergence in spherical coordinates depends on the symmetry of the field. Since the field has only a radial component and depends on r, the divergence might involve derivatives in the radial direction only. 

Let me recall the formula for divergence in spherical coordinates. The divergence of a vector field A, which has components A_r, A_θ, A_φ, is given by (1/(r²)) * [d(r² A_r)/dr + (1/sinθ) d(A_θ)/dθ + (1/(sinθ r)) d(A_φ)/dφ]. 

In this problem, the vector field has only a radial component, so A_θ and A_φ are zero. That simplifies the formula to (1/r²) * d(r² A_r)/dr.

So, substituting A_r as f(r) since it's the radial component. So f(r) is 1/r², right? Wait, no, wait. The magnitude is 1/r², but since it's only radial, so A_r = 1/r² and the other components are zero. So plugging into the divergence formula:

∇ · f = (1/r²) * d/dr (r² * (1/r²)) )

Let me compute that. r² times 1/r² is 1. So the derivative of 1 with respect to r is zero. So ∇ · f = (1/r²) * 0 = 0. 

So the divergence of the field is zero everywhere except maybe at the origin, since at r=0, the field might not be defined. But wait, if I integrate the divergence over a volume that
