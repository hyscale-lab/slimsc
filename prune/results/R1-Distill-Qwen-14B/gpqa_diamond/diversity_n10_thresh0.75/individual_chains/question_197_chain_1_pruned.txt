Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by carefully reading the question and the data provided.

The question says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I remember that red phosphorus is often used in the Hunsdiecker reaction, which typically converts an alkyne into a diiodide. Wait, no, wait—red phosphorus and HI are usually involved in the substitution of a triple bond to form an alkyl iodide. Or maybe it's the other way around. Oh right, when you have an alkyne and react it with red phosphorus and HI, the triple bond is converted into a diiodide. Wait, no, another thought: maybe it's the dehydrohalogenation or something else. Hmm, I might be getting this mixed up. Alternatively, I think red phosphorus and HI are used in the presence of an alkyne to form an alkyl iodide via a substitution reaction. Let me think—the Hunsdiecker reaction is about converting alkyl halides to other compounds. No, wait, maybe I'm confusing it with something else. Alternatively, perhaps it's a reaction where an alkyne is converted. Oh wait, maybe it's the reaction where an alkyne (triple bond) is converted into a diiodide. So, if the compound has a triple bond, reacting with red phosphorus and HI would add iodine across the triple bond, making a diiodide. Or maybe it's an elimination reaction. Hmm, perhaps it's better to first figure out what Compound X is from the spectral data, and then see what reaction it undergoes.

Let's look at the spectral data of Compound X.

The IR data is: 3400–2500 cm⁻¹, 1720 cm⁻¹, 1610 cm⁻¹, 1450 cm⁻¹.

The strong absorption between 3400–2500 cm⁻¹ suggests either an alkyne (sp-hybridized C-H stretch) or an amine, but more likely an alkyne because the 1720 cm⁻¹ is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch, which would be maybe a ketone or ester. But wait, alkyne C-H stretching is usually around 3300-2500, which is where the IR shows a peak. So that supports the idea of an alkyne. The 1720 cm⁻¹ could be a carbonyl, like a ketone, ester, or maybe an acid. But wait, acids have O-H stretches around 2500–3300 cm⁻¹ (broad), but the IR here shows a broad peak in that region, but also a 1720. But wait, the initial peak is from 3400–2500, which is a broad region—so maybe that's the O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid. Because carboxylic acids have a broad O-H stretch around 2500–3300, and a strong carbonyl around 1700. So that makes sense. So Compound X might be a carboxylic acid with an alkyne group.

Wait, but another thought: if it's a carboxylic acid, the IR would also have a strong absorption around 1700 cm⁻¹, which matches the 1720. The 1610 and 1450 cm⁻¹ might be due to aromatic ring vibrations, like C=C stretching in a benzene ring. So perhaps Compound X is an aromatic compound with a carboxylic acid group and maybe an alkyne as well?

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. The 1720 cm⁻¹ is a carbonyl, which can be from a ketone, aldehyde, ester, acid, etc. The presence of a broad peak in 3400-2500 suggests an O-H stretch. So that's more indicative of a carboxylic acid. Because alcohols and amines have O-H or N-H stretches, but they are usually less broad. Carboxylic acids have a very broad O-H stretch around 2500–3300, which fits. So that suggests that the compound has a carboxylic acid group.

Now, looking at the 1H NMR data:

10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): A broad singlet around 10.5 is typical for a carboxylic acid proton. So that's another confirmation. So the compound has a -COOH group.

The rest of the NMR:

8.0 ppm (d, 2H): Two protons as a doublet, likely aromatic protons, possibly para-substituted to another group.

7.2 ppm (d, 2H): Another doublet, probably the ortho protons relative to the substituent. So this suggests an aromatic ring with substituents in para positions.

2.9 ppm (m, 1H): A multiplet integrating to 1H. Could this be a CH near an electronegative atom or part of an alkyne? Hmm, maybe a CH adjacent to a carbonyl or something else.

1.7 ppm (m, 2H): Two protons as a multiplet, perhaps a CH2 group. Maybe part of an ethyl or propyl chain.

1.4 ppm (d, 3H): A triplet of three protons as a doublet, which is typical for a CH(CH3) group, a geminal di-substitution. Wait, a doublet with 3H is often a methyl group attached to something. For example, a methyl adjacent to something like
