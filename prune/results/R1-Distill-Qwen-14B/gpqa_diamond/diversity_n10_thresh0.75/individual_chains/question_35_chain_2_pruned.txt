Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about angular momentum operators. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to think it through.

The question is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator Ay. Let me read the setup again. Oh right, Ay is given as c multiplied by S. The constant c is h/(4π), where h is probably Planck's constant. S is a 2x2 matrix with the first row as [0, -i] and the second row as [i, 0]. 

So, first, I think I should write down what the matrix Ay looks like. Since Ay = c * S, each element of S gets multiplied by c. So let's compute that.

The matrix S is:
[ 0   -i ]
[ i    0 ]

Multiplying each element by c = h/(4π), the matrix Ay becomes:
[ 0     -i*(h/(4π)) ]
[ i*(h/(4π))    0 ]

I can write this as:
Ay = (h/(4π)) * [ [0, -i], [i, 0] ]

Wait, but I recall that in quantum mechanics, the spin matrices for spin-1/2 particles (like electrons or muons) are given by S_x, S_y, S_z, which are proportional to the Pauli matrices. Oh right, the Pauli matrices have the form similar to S here, scaled by ħ/2. Wait, but in this case, the matrix S is given as [[0, -i], [i, 0]], which doesn't look like the standard Pauli matrices. Let me think: the standard Pauli Y matrix is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So S here is actually the Pauli Y matrix, sigma_y. So S = sigma_y.

So then, Ay = c * sigma_y, which is (h/(4π)) * sigma_y.

Wait, but the Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ± ħ/2 for their respective spin components. That's because the spin operator S is given by (ħ/2) sigma, where sigma is the Pauli vector. So, for example, S_y is (ħ/2) sigma_y. But in our case, Ay is given as c multiplied by sigma_y. So let me compute c.

c is h/(4π). Wait,
