Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again and think through it step by step.

So the problem says: We have an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e and negligible mass. 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. We need to find the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimals.

Hmm. So the setup is that there's a central charge at point P, and 12 other charges are all located 2 meters away from P. Each of the particles has charge 2e. Wait, e is the elementary charge, right? So each charge is twice that. So each is 2 * 1.6e-19 coulombs, which is 3.2e-19 C.

The system is isolated, so I think that implies that we're considering the electrostatic potential energy between all the charges. Because in an isolated system, no work is done by an external electric field or something like that. So the energy is due to the interactions between the charges themselves.

But wait, the 13th charge is fixed at P. So that's the central charge. The other 12 are all at 2 meters away. So I think the system consists of the 13th (fixed) charge and the 12 others arranged around it.

So the potential energy of the system would be the sum of the potential energies between each pair of charges, right? But wait, wait. Because the 13th charge is fixed, maybe the calculation is a bit different.

Wait no, I think in the system, all charges contribute to the potential energy. But since the 13th is fixed, perhaps only the potential between the 13th and each of the 12 contributes, plus the potential among the 12 themselves.

Wait, but the problem asks for the minimum energy. So perhaps the configuration is such that the 12 charges are arranged in a way that minimizes the potential energy. But wait, because all the 12 are at the same distance from P, they're all at 2 meters. So their configuration is symmetric. So perhaps they form a regular dodecahedron or something, but wait, maybe it's a simpler arrangement, like equally spaced on a circle, but for 12 points, that's a lot, but maybe they're
