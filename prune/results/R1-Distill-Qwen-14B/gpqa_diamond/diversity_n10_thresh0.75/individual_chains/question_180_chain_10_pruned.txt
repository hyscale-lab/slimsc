Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it's about an isolated system of charges. Alright, let me read it carefully.

So, the problem says there are 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. Oh, wait, e is the elementary charge, right? So each particle has a charge of twice that. And they have negligible mass, so I don't have to worry about any kinetic energy or anything like that. The system is isolated, so no external fields or anything.

12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. Oh, point P is where the 13th charge is fixed. So, the 13th charge is at P, and the other 12 are each at a distance of 2 meters from P. Wait, but the 12 charges are all at 2 meters from P, so they're all the same distance away. So, the configuration is like a point charge at P, and 12 charges arranged symmetrically around it, each 2 meters away.

The question is about the minimum energy of this system. Oh, right, because electric potential energy depends on the configuration of charges. Since the system is isolated, the energy would be the electric potential energy of the entire setup.

I remember that the electric potential energy (U) of a system of point charges is the work done to assemble them, bringing each charge from infinity to their positions. The formula for the potential energy between two point charges is U = k * (q1 * q2) / r, where k is Coulomb's constant, approximately 8.988 x 10^9 N·m²/C².

But wait, since there are multiple charges, each pair contributes to the total potential energy. Oh, but wait, in this case, the 13th charge is fixed, so we don't move that one. The 12 charges are each placed at 2 meters from P. So, I think I need to calculate the potential energy between the fixed charge (at P) and each of the 12 charges, and also the potential energy between each pair of the 12 charges themselves.

Wait, right! Because each of the 12 charges also interact with each other. So, the total potential energy is the sum of the potential energies between the fixed charge and each of the 12, plus the potential energies between each
