Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit rusty on some concepts, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The question is about the percentage of a specific cobalt complex in a solution. We have Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN⁻) in solution. The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the [SCN⁻] is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. We need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes, which I think refers to the [Co(SCN)₂]²+ complex, maybe that's the third or fourth complex? Wait, stability constants usually increase with the number of ligands, but β4 is 16, which is less than β3. Hmm, maybe I got that wrong. Or perhaps the order is different. But the question is about the percentage of the dithiocyanato complexes, so that's the one with two SCN⁻ ligands, right? Like [Co(SCN)₂]²+.

Wait, actually, I'm a bit confused about the number of ligands each β corresponds to. Let me think. Stability constants (log β) are for the formation of complexes. So, β1 is for the first complex, which would be [Co(SCN)]+, β2 for [Co(SCN)₂]²+, β3 for [Co(SCN)₃] and β4 for [Co(SCN)₄]^2- maybe? I'm not entirely sure about the charge, but that's the general idea.

So the problem is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex, which is the one with two SCN⁻ ions, so that's the [Co(SCN)₂]²+ complex. So we're looking for the fraction of Co in that form.

The approach should be to calculate the fraction of each complex and sum them up to see what percentage the dithiocyanato (the second complex) contributes.

Stability constants are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Wait, that's a bit odd because β4 is lower than β3. So maybe the order is
