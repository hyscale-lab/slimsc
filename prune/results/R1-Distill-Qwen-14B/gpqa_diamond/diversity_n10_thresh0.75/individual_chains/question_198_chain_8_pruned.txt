Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to work through it. The question is about the stability constants of cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes and figuring out the percentage of a specific blue dithiocyanato complex among all cobalt species in solution.

Hmm, I remember that stability constants (β) tell us how stable a complex is. A higher β means the complex is more stable because the reaction tends to go to the product side. So the complex with the highest β is the most stable.

The problem states that the solution has Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-). The concentrations are c(Co) = 1e-2 M and [SCN-] = 0.1 M. The stability constants given are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. Wait, I'm a bit confused, what do these β values correspond to? Oh right, each β corresponds to a different complex. So Co(SCN)n^m+ would have a stability constant βn, I think.

Wait, so the complexes might be [Co(SCN)]^2+, [Co(SCN)2]^0, [Co(SCN)3]^-, and [Co(SCN)4]^2- or something like that. But I'm not entirely sure about the charges, but perhaps that's not crucial for this calculation. Anyway, the key point is each β corresponds to a different number of SCN- ligands attached to Co(II).

The question is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex, which I think is the [Co(SCN)2]^0 complex. So that's the complex with two SCN- ligands. So we need to find the fraction of Co that is in the form of [Co(SCN)2]^0.

Stability constants are used to calculate the distribution of metal complexes in solution. The general approach is to use the stability constants to find the fraction of each complex, then sum them up considering all possible complexes.

I think the formula for the fraction of a particular complex is (βn * [Co] * [SCN]^n) / (sum over all n of βn * [Co] * [SCN]^n + [Co free]). Wait, no. Wait, the fraction of each complex is given by (
