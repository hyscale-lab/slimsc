Okay, let's tackle this chemistry problem. Hmm, the question is a bit complex, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

So, the problem starts with Substance X, which incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. I know that isotopes have the same number of protons but different neutrons. So, when we're talking about a heavier isotope, it probably has more neutrons. For example, if the element is chlorine, the heavier isotope would be Cl-35 compared to Cl-37? Wait, no. Wait, Cl has two main isotopes: Cl-35 and Cl-37, with Cl-35 being lighter. So if X has a heavier isotope, maybe it's using Cl-37 instead of Cl-35. But I'm not sure yet.

Next, X reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing gas W. The gas W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. Let's think about that. The molecule of W has equal protons and neutrons. So, for a molecule, each atom contributes protons and neutrons. Wait, if it's a molecule composed of atoms that have the same number of protons and neutrons each. Or maybe the molecule as a whole has equal number of protons and neutrons. Hmm, maybe the gas is something like H2O? No, that's not it. Wait, let's think of simple gases.

Wait, what if W is CO2? No, that's a gas but I don't think it fits. Let me think about molecules where each atom has protons equal to neutrons. For example, hydrogen has 1 proton and 0 neutrons (if it's H-1). No, that's not equal. Wait, deuterium is H-2, which has 1 proton and 1 neutron. So equal. So maybe the gas is H2? Because each H atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron if it's deuterium. So, if W is H2, then each molecule has 2 atoms, each with 1 proton and 1 neutron. So the molecule's total protons would be 2, total neutrons would be 2. So the number of protons and neutrons in the molecule is equal. That fits the condition.

Alternatively, another possibility is O2. O has 8 protons. Its neutrons would be 8 in the case of O-1
