Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their photospheres, and I'm a bit rusty on some of the concepts, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see...

The question states that iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to those in star_2. The energy difference between the energy levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. We're supposed to find the equation relating their effective temperatures, T1 and T2, assuming LTE holds.

Hmm. I remember that under LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), the distribution of atoms in different energy levels follows the Boltzmann distribution. The Boltzmann equation relates the populations of two energy levels. The formula is something like n_j / n_i = (g_j / g_i) * exp( - (E_j - E_i) / (k*T) ), where g's are the statistical weights, E's are energies, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is temperature.

Wait, in this case, the problem says the excitation is twice as much. So, I think that refers to the ratio of populations in the excited state to the ground state, or maybe the ratio of the excited level to another level. Let's clarify: the question says the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. So perhaps the ratio of the upper state to the lower state is twice as much in star_1 compared to star_2.

Wait, no. The problem says 'twice as excited', which I think refers to the population in the higher energy level. So for star_1, the population in the specific excited energy level (let's say level j) is twice that of star_2's population at the same level. Or wait, maybe it's that the ratio between the excited and non-excited (ground) is twice? Hmm, the exact wording is a bit unclear. Let me re-read the question.

"iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So for a specific energy level, the excitation is twice as much in star_1. So perhaps the number (n) of atoms in that level in star_1 is twice that of star_2. Or, it could be the excitation potential—wait, no, the energy difference is given, so it's about the ratio of populations.

So let's model this. Let's say for each star, the ratio of the number of atoms in an excited state (n_j) to the ground state (n_i) is given by the Boltzmann factor. So for star_1, n_j1 / n_i1 = (g_j / g_i) * exp( - (ΔE) / (k T1) ), and similarly for star_2, n_j2 / n_i2 = (g_j / g_i) * exp( - (ΔE) / (k T2) ).

But wait, the problem says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited", so perhaps the ratio n_j1 / n_i1 is twice (n_j2 / n_i2). So (n_j1/n_i1) = 2 (n_j2/n_i2).

Assuming that ΔE is the same for both (since it's the same energy levels), because the energy
