Okay, so I've got this question here about two planets orbiting a star, and I need to find the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, let me try to break this down.

Alright, the question gives a lot of data. Let me jot it down. The star has a mass of 1.5 solar masses, radius 1.2 solar radii, and effective temperature Teff of 6300 K. The two planets are Planet1 and Planet2. Planet1 has a mass of 7 Earth masses and radius 1.7 Earth radii. Planet2 is 5 Earth masses and 1.3 Earth radii. Both have the same albedo, which I think means their reflectivity is the same, so that won't affect the calculations differently.

The question mentions transit and radial velocity methods. Oh right, the transit method involves the planet passing in front of the star, causing a dip in brightness, and the radial velocity (RV) method looks at the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum as the planet's gravity makes the star wobble. But I'm not sure if those methods are directly relevant to finding the equilibrium temperature ratio. Maybe the RV info is just for telling us the mass of the planets or something else, but perhaps not for the temperature part.

Wait, the question says that each planet induces a periodic shift in the forbidden line [OI] at 6300 Å. Planet1 causes a 0.03 Å shift, and Planet2 a 0.04 Å shift. Oh, I think this is related to the RV method, where the Doppler shift corresponds to the star's velocity due to the planet's orbit. The shift in wavelength is due to the Doppler effect. The formula I remember is delta_lambda / lambda = v / c, where v is the velocity of the star towards or away from us, and c is the speed of light.

But how does that help me find the planets' orbital periods or distances? Oh wait, the RV method gives the mass of the planet based on the star's velocity amplitude and the orbital period. But since both planets are detected via RV, perhaps the shifts are connected to their masses and orbital parameters.

Wait, but maybe the Doppler shifts (the 0.03 and 0.04 Angstrom shifts) are used to find the velocities of the star due to each planet. Let me think: the Doppler shift formula is delta_lambda = (lambda * v) / c. Wait, but delta_lambda is proportional to v. So, the ratio of the velocities would be the same as the ratio of the shifts divided by the same lambda, but the lambda here is the same for both planets because it's the same forbidden line. So, the velocity of the star caused by Planet1 (v1) and Planet2 (v2) would be in the ratio of 0.03 : 0.04, which simplifies to 3:4.

But wait, how is the star's velocity related to the planet's orbital velocity and the distance? The star and planet orbit their mutual center of mass. The star's velocity v is related to the planet's velocity via the mass ratio. The formula for the RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( (2π G)^(1/3) ) * ( (
