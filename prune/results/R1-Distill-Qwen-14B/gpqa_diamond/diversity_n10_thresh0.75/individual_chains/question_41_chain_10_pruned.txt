Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving medium. Hmm, let me try to think it through. Alright, the question says a light beam is propagating through glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer. I need to find the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the lab frame.

Wait, I remember that when dealing with light in moving media, there's some relativity involved. Oh right, the index of refraction affects the speed of light, and the medium's motion affects it too. But wait, the speed of light in a medium is generally v = c/n, but does that hold when the medium itself is moving?

Wait, no, in the medium's rest frame, the light's speed is c/n. But when the medium is moving, we have to consider how that affects the observed speed in the lab frame. So I think this involves some sort of velocity addition, maybe from special relativity?

Hold on, let's break it down. The glass is moving at velocity v relative to the lab. The light is moving through the glass, so in the glass's frame, the light speed is c/n. But how does that translate when the glass is moving?

Wait, velocity addition in relativity is a bit tricky. The formula is u' = (u + v)/(1 + (u v)/c²), but wait, that's when you're transforming from the lab frame to a frame moving at speed v. Or is it the other way around? Hmm, maybe I should think about it differently.

Alternatively, in the lab frame, the glass is moving at velocity v towards the observer. The light is moving through the glass, so in the glass's frame, the light speed is v_light = c/n. So we can model this as a situation where the light's velocity in the lab frame combines with the glass's motion.

Wait, but in the glass's rest frame, the light's speed is c/n. Since the glass is moving at velocity v, we need to find the light's velocity in the lab frame using the velocity addition formula.

Wait, the velocity addition formula from special relativity is u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' v)/(c²)), where u is the velocity observed in the lab frame, and u' is the velocity in the glass's frame.

But wait, in the glass's frame, the light is moving at u' = c/n. So plugging that into the
