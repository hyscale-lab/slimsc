Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonances and their decay distances. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The question gives me some parameters: the production energy E_X is 8 GeV, the mass m_X is 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X is 320 MeV. I need to find the mean decay distance, and choose between options A to D.

Wait, what do I remember about decay distances? Oh right, particles that decay have a mean lifetime determined by their lifetime, which is related to their decay width. The mean decay distance is the product of the lifetime and the velocity of the particle. So, distance = v * τ.

First, I think I should find the lifetime τ. I remember that the lifetime is given by τ = ħ / Γ, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant and Γ is the decay width.

But wait, Γ is given in MeV. I need to convert that into energy units compatible with the other constants. Planck's constant has units of energy·time, right? Or more precisely, in natural units where ħ = 197.33 MeV·fm (femtometers) or something like that. Wait, let me think. The reduced Planck constant ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. Because 1 GeV is 1000 MeV, so 6.582e-25 GeV·s is the same as 6.582e-22 MeV·s, right?

Wait, maybe I should double-check the value. Oh right, I think I remember that ħ is about 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·seconds. Because 1 GeV is 1e9 eV, and 1 eV·s is approximately 1.6e-19 J·s, but I don't need to convert units because we're using natural units.

Wait, but in particle physics, they often use units where ħ = 6.582 MeV·fm, because 1 fm is 1e-15 meters. Hmm, maybe that's a better approach.

So, let me think again. The decay width Γ is given as 320 MeV. The lifetime τ is ħ / Γ. So, if ħ is 6
