Okay, so I have this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see, the question is asking for the mean decay distance of a meson X. The given values are production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are A to D, each with different distances in meters, some in 10^-15 and others in 10^-16.

Wait, I remember that decay distance has something to do with the particle's lifetime. The mean decay length, right? Because when a particle is moving, it travels some distance before decaying. So the formula probably involves the particle's lifetime multiplied by its velocity and the speed of light.

Oh right! The mean decay distance L is given by L = γ * c * τ, where τ is the proper lifetime, and γ is the Lorentz factor. Alternatively, I've heard it expressed as L = (E * c) * τ / (m), because E = γ m c², but I might be mixing things up. Let's get the exact formula.

Wait, the lifetime τ is related to the width Γ. The width Γ is the total decay width, and it's connected to the mean lifetime by τ = ħ / Γ, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant. So Γ is the energy width, and τ is inversely proportional to it. But since Γ is given in GeV, and ħ has units of GeV·s, maybe I can use that to get τ in seconds.

But wait, GeV is energy, and the Planck constant is in J·s. I think I need to convert units properly. Let me jot down the constants. The reduced Planck constant ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. So Γ is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. So τ = ħ / Γ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) = approximately 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Wait, wait, wait. Let me calculate that more accurately. 6.582 divided by 0.32 is about 20.56875, so 20
