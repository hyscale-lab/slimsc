Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the eigenvalues of a Hamiltonian operator. Hmm, the Hamiltonian is given as H equals epsilon times the dot product of sigma and n. Oh wait, sigma is the vector of Pauli spin matrices, and n is a unit vector. Right, I remember the Pauli matrices are sigma_x, sigma_y, sigma_z, each a 2x2 matrix.

Wait, the dot product would be sigma_x n_x + sigma_y n_y + sigma_z n_z, right? And each Pauli matrix is multiplied by the corresponding component of the unit vector n. So the whole thing is a 2x2 matrix multiplied by epsilon.

I think the eigenvalues of a Pauli matrix are ±1. Because each Pauli matrix, when squared, gives the identity matrix. So for any Pauli matrix sigma_i, sigma_i squared is I, so eigenvalues are 1 and -1.

But wait, the Hamiltonian is H = ε (sigma · n). Since n is a unit vector, the expression sigma · n is another matrix whose eigenvalues are ±1. Because, regardless of the direction of n, when you take the dot product with sigma, the resulting matrix has the same eigenvalues as any Pauli matrix, which are ±1. Because the trace is zero and determinant is -1, so eigenvalues are 1 and -1.

Wait, let me think again. Because if you have a spin-1/2 system, the spin operator is (hbar/2) sigma. So the eigenvalues of sigma · n would be ±1, but when scaled by hbar/2, the eigenvalues become ±hbar/2.

Wait, but in the Hamiltonian here, it's just epsilon times sigma · n. So H is a 2x2 matrix with eigenvalues ±epsilon? Because if sigma · n has eigenvalues ±1, multiplying by epsilon gives ±epsilon.

Wait, no, wait. Let me get this right. The eigenvalues of H would be the eigenvalues of the operator multiplied by epsilon. So if sigma · n has eigenvalues ±1, then H would have eigenvalues ±epsilon.

Looking at the options, option B says +epsilon and -epsilon. Option C says ±epsilon hbar/2. Oh wait, but wait, is there any factor of hbar involved here?

Wait, the given Hamiltonian is H = epsilon (sigma · n). But in the standard spin Hamiltonian, like the Zeeman Hamiltonian, it's something like H = gamma S · B, where gamma is the gyromagnetic ratio. For electrons, S is (hbar/2) sigma. So H would be gamma (hbar/2 sigma) · n. 

But in this problem, H is given as epsilon times sigma · n. So it's as if gamma (hbar/2) is equal to epsilon. So the eigenvalues would be ±epsilon, because H would have eigenvalues ±epsilon.

So the eigenvalues are plus and minus epsilon. So the correct option is B.

But wait, wait another thing. The Pauli matrices are sigma^i, each having eigenvalues ±1, but when you have a spin operator, it's (hbar/2) sigma^i. So perhaps H is written as epsilon (sigma · n), but actually, the operator should involve hbar/2. Hmm. Or maybe the problem doesn't involve hbar because the Pauli matrices are defined without it.

Wait, the problem says the components of sigma are the Pauli spin matrices. The Pauli matrices are defined as sigma_x, sigma_y, sigma_z, which are 2x2 matrices with elements like [[0,1],[1,0]] etc. These have eigenvalues ±1.

So if H is epsilon times (sigma · n), then H is a 2x2 matrix with eigenvalues ±epsilon. So eigenvalues are ±epsilon. So the answer is B.

So looking at the options, option B is +epsilon and -epsilon.


The Hamiltonian is given as \( H = \varepsilon \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \), where \( \vec{\sigma} \) represents the Pauli spin matrices, \( \vec{n} \) is a unit vector, and \( \varepsilon \) is a constant with the dimension of energy. The eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian can be determined as follows:

1. The dot product \( \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \) is a matrix operator formed as \( \sigma_x n_x + \sigma_y n_y + \sigma_z n_z \). Since \( \vec{n} \) is a unit vector, the resulting matrix has eigenvalues \( \pm 1 \), regardless of the direction of \( \vec{n} \).

2. The eigenvalues of \( H \) are obtained by multiplying the eigenvalues of \( \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \) by \( \varepsilon \). Thus, the eigenvalues of \( H \) are \( \pm \varepsilon \).

3. The problem does not explicitly involve the factor \( \hbar \), as the Hamiltonian is written in terms of the Pauli matrices \( \vec{\sigma} \), which are dimensionless. Therefore, the eigenvalues are simply \( \pm \varepsilon \).

4. Among the given options, the correct choice is \( +\varepsilon, -\varepsilon \), which corresponds to option B.

Answer: B
