Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's read through it again.

The question is about two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Its mass is also 1.5 times larger, but I'm not sure if mass affects luminosity in this context. The problem says the astronomers found the wavelengths where the stars appear brightest are the same. Then, the radial velocities are given: Star_1 has 0 and Star_2 has 700 km/s. We assume the stars radiate as black bodies and need to compute the luminosity factor of Star_1 compared to Star_2.

Hmm. So, the main points are luminosity, radius, and velocity. And both stars are black bodies, so I can probably use the Stefan-Boltzmann law here, which says L = 4πR²σT⁴, where R is radius, T is temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.

But wait, how do the velocities come into play? Oh, right, radial velocity is related to the Doppler effect. Since Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0, maybe it's not moving towards or away from us. Star_2 is moving away at 700 km/s. Wait, but how does that affect the observed wavelength?

Oh, right! The Doppler effect shifts the wavelength. The star emitting light that's moving away from us (like Star_2) would have its light redshifted. The peak wavelength of emission would be longer than the rest wavelength. Conversely, if a star is moving towards us, the light would be blueshifted. But in this case, Star_1 isn't moving, so its peak wavelength is at its rest frame. Star_2 is moving away, so its observed peak wavelength is longer than its rest wavelength.

Wait, but the problem states that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. So the observed wavelengths are the same. So, Star_2's emitted peak wavelength is shifted to match Star_1's observed wavelength, which is the same as Star_1's emitted wavelength since Star_1 isn't moving.

So, let me formalize this. For a star with temperature T, the peak wavelength λ is given by Wien's law: λ = b / T, where b is
