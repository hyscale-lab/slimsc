Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Hmm, let's see what the question is about.

Alright, so there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. The astronomers found that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, right, the peak wavelength is the same. And their radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s respectively. Wait, but how does radial velocity affect this?

The question is about the luminosity ratio. They assume both stars radiate as black bodies. So I should probably use the Stefan-Boltzmann law for luminosity, which is L = 4πR²σT⁴. Oh wait, but wait a minute, the peak wavelength is given by Wien's law. Wien's displacement law says that the peak wavelength λ_max is proportional to 1/T, so T = constant / λ_max. Since the peak wavelengths are the same for both stars, their temperatures must be the same. Wait, but wait—hold on. The radial velocity part, how does that affect the observed wavelength?

Oh wait, I think I might be mixing up two things. The peak emission wavelength is determined by the star's temperature. But if the star is moving towards or away from us
