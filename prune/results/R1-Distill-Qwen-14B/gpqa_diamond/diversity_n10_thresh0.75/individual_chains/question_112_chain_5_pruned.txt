Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me read it again carefully to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem says: Let |alpha> be the state describing an electron, proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. I need to calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of another operator. The matrix representation of this operator has elements Aij where Aij = ħ/2 if i is different from j, and 0 otherwise. Also, find the average value of that operator.

The options given are A, B, C, D with specific probabilities and average values.

Alright, so let me break this down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I need to find the probabilities of measuring the electron in each eigenstate of the operator with matrix Aij. But wait, what's the operator's matrix exactly? Let me get that clear.

The operator has A_ij elements. So for a 2x2 matrix, since the spin states are up and down (two states), the matrix A would be:

A = [ [0, ħ/2],
       [ħ/2, 0] ]

Because when i != j, Aij is ħ/2, else 0. So it's a 2x2 matrix with zeros on the diagonal and ħ/2 off-diagonal.

Wait, but for spin-1/2 particles, the Pauli matrices come into play. Oh, right! The Pauli matrices are σ_x, σ_y, σ_z. The operator A here looks like it could be proportional to σ_x or σ_y or something else.

Wait, no. Let me think. The Pauli matrices are defined as:

σ_x = [[0,1],[1,0]]
σ_y = [[0,-i],[i,0]]
σ_z = [[1,0],[0,-1]]

So if our operator has A_ij = ħ/2 when i≠j, then A = (ħ/2)(σ_x) if the off-diagonal elements are positive. Because σ_x has 1s in the off-diagonal. Wait, but our A has ħ/2 in both positions, so
