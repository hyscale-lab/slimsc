Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it slow.

The problem says that the state |alpha> is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. Oh right, |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. So, first, I think I need to normalize this state because it's only proportional. But wait, the problem doesn't ask about probabilities related to z-projection; it's about another operator. Oh right, the operator whose matrix elements are given by Aij. So Aij is hbar/2 when i≠j and 0 otherwise. Hmm, that sounds familiar. Oh wait, that's the Pauli X matrix multiplied by hbar/2. Because the Pauli matrices have 0s on the diagonal and 1s off-diagonal (but for X, it's actually [[0,1],[1,0]], and Y and Z have other signs). So this operator is like (hbar/2) * sigma_x, right?

Wait, let's think about the matrix. If i and j are the row and column indices, then for a 2x2 matrix, the diagonal elements are zero, and the off-diagonal elements (i≠j) are hbar/2. So matrix A would be:

[ [0, hbar/2],
  [hbar/2, 0] ]

Yes, that's the X operator scaled by hbar/2. The X operator itself is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So the operator given here is (hbar/2) * X.

But the problem is, we need to find the probability of measuring each eigenstate of this operator. Wait, but the eigenstates of X are |+x> and |-x>, which are superpositions of |up> and |down>. So to find the probabilities, I'll probably have to express |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of A.

Alternatively, maybe I can diagonalize A and find the projections. Since A is proportional to X, its eigenstates are |+x> and |-x>, which are the same as for X.

So first, I need to find |alpha> in the eigenbasis of A (i.e., the X eigenbasis). But wait, |alpha> is given in terms of |up> and |down>, which are the eigenstates of Z. So I think I should first express |alpha> in the X eigenbasis.

But maybe a better approach is to compute the expansion of |alpha> in the X eigenbasis. Let me recall that the eigenstates of X are:

|+x> = (|up> + |down>) / sqrt(2)
|-x> = (|up> - |down>) / sqrt(2)

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the eigenstates of X are |+x> and |-x>, which are equally superpositions of |up> and |down>, but with a phase. Let me make sure. For X, when you apply it to |+x>, you get +1 times |+x>.

So |+x> = (|0> + |1>)/sqrt(2) for qubit states. But in our case, |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of sigma_z. So |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and |-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), but wait, I'm not sure about the signs. Let me think, because X acting on |+x> should give |+x> again, right?

Wait, actually, the correct expressions are:

|+x> = (|0> + |1>)/sqrt(2)
|-x> = (|0> - |1>)/sqrt(2)

So in our notation, |up> is |0> and |down> is |1> perhaps. Or maybe |up> is |+z> and |down> is |-z>. Either way, |+x> is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and |-x> is (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2) times 1/sqrt(2).

Wait, let me make sure. The eigenvectors of X are (1,1) and (1,-1), right? So when normalized, they are (1/sqrt(2))(1,1) and (1/sqrt(2))(1,-1). So yes, that's right.

So to find the expansion of |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |-x>, I need to compute the inner products.

But first, I need to normalize |alpha> because it's given as proportional. Let's compute |alpha> first. The state is given as (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down>. Let's compute the normalization factor. The norm squared is |1+i|^2 + |2 -i|^2.

Compute |1 + i|^2: (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2.

Compute |2 - i|^2: (2)^2 + (-1)^2 =4 +1=5.

So the total norm squared is 2 +5=7. So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). Therefore, |alpha> = [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

Hmm, okay. Now, I need to express this in the |+x> and |-x> basis.

Let me write |alpha> as a linear combination of |+x> and |-x>. So:

|alpha> = c_+ |+x> + c_- |-x>

I need to find c_+ and c_-.

The coefficients are given by the inner products. So,

c_+ = < +x | alpha >
c_- = < -x | alpha >

Let me compute each coefficient.

First, |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2). So,

c_+ = < +x | alpha > = (1/sqrt(2)) [ <up| + <down| ] |alpha>

= (1/sqrt(2)) [ <up| alpha > + <down| alpha > ]

But |alpha> is [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

So,

<up| alpha > = (1+i)/sqrt(7),
<down| alpha > = (2 -i)/sqrt(7).

So,

c_+ = (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1 + i)/sqrt(7) + (2 - i)/sqrt(7) ) ]

Wait, wait, no: because <up| alpha > is (1+i)/sqrt(7), and <down| alpha > is (2 - i)/sqrt(7). So,

c_+ = (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1 + i + 2 - i) / sqrt(7) ) ]

Wait, let's calculate the numerator:

1 + i + 2 - i = (1+2) + (i -i) =3.

So,

c_+ = (1/sqrt(2)) * (3 / sqrt(7)) ) = 3/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(7)) ) = 3/sqrt(14).

Similarly, let's compute c_-.

c_- = < -x | alpha > = (1/sqrt
