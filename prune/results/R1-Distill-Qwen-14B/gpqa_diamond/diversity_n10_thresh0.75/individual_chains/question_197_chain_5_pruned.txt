Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what the question says.

The problem states that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I need to identify the final product from the given options. The data provided includes IR and 1H NMR spectra, so I should start by analyzing those to determine the structure of Compound X.

First, looking at the IR data: peaks at 3400–2500 cm-1, 1720 cm-1, 1610 cm-1, and 1450 cm-1. The broad peak between 3400 and 2500 likely indicates an -OH stretch, maybe from a carboxylic acid or an alcohol. But the presence of a strong peak at 1720 cm-1 suggests a carbonyl group. Carboxylic acids typically have O-H stretches around 2500–3300 as broad peaks and carbonyl around 1700 cm-1. The 1610 and 1450 cm-1 peaks could be from aromatic C=C stretching.

Now the NMR data: 
- 10.5 ppm (broad singlet, 1H) – this is a strong downfield shift, probably an -OH proton from a carboxylic acid.
- 8.0 ppm (doublet, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (doublet, 2H) – these are aromatic protons. The doublets suggest a para-disubstituted benzene ring. The upfield shift at 7.2 ppm compared to 8.0 ppm might mean that the substituents are electron-donating groups. Wait, no, actually, substituents like methyl are ortho/para directors and don't strongly deshield the ring. Alternatively, if there's an electron-withdrawing group like a carbonyl, the ring protons would be more deshielded. But in this case, the substituents are para, so maybe it's a para-substituted benzene with another group.
Wait, let's think again. The two doublets each integrate to 2H, so it's likely a para-substituted benzene. For example, if the ring has two substituents in the para positions, each causing the protons on either side to be equivalent. Alternatively, if one substituent is in the para position and another is in the meta, but that would give more complex splitting. So maybe it's a para-substituted ring with two substituents.

Wait, the substituents could be a carbonyl group (like a ketone or ester or acid) and another group. But looking at the NMR shifts: the 8.0 ppm is downfield, which is more typical for protons adjacent to electron-withdrawing groups. If the substituents are a carbonyl group and another group like an isopropyl or something else.

Then, the other NMR peaks:
- 2.9 ppm (multiplet, 1H) – maybe a CH adjacent to an electronegative atom, like an oxygen in a carbonyl. Or perhaps a methine (CH) group in an isopropyl or similar.
- 1.7 ppm (multiplet, 2H) – possibly CH2 groups near an electronegative atom or in a chain.
- 1.4 ppm (doublet, 3H) – a methyl group attached to something, maybe a CH2 group, like in an ethyl chain or an isopropyl group.
- 0.9 ppm (triplet, 3H) – a terminal methyl group, likely from an ethyl chain. So this could be part of an ethyl group (like -CH2CH2CH3), where the triplet is from the CH2 next to the CH2CH3.

Putting this together, the structure might involve a benzene ring with substituents. Let's think about the substituents.

The IR has a peak at 1720 cm-1, which I think is a carbonyl. So maybe it's a benzoic acid derivative. But then the -OH at 10.5 ppm would fit that. Alternatively, if it's an ester, but the 1720 is more typical of an ester than a carboxylic acid (which is around 1700 and could be broader). Hmm, but the broadness of the 10.5 ppm peak suggests an -OH, which is present in carboxylic acids.

Wait, but wait. If it's a carboxylic acid, the carbonyl peak would be around 1700 cm-1. 1720 might be higher, which could suggest an ester or maybe a ketone. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's a conjugated carbonyl group, like in an aromatic ring. For example, a benzophenone-type structure would have a carbonyl around 1680-1700, but maybe higher if conjugated.

Wait, but another possibility: if the compound is a methyl ester, the carbonyl would be around 1720. But then the IR would have the ester O-H as well, but I'm not sure.

Let me look at the NMR again. The 10.5 ppm peak is a broad singlet, which is probably the -COOH proton. But wait, carboxylic acids usually have a broad peak, yes. But if it's an ester, there wouldn't be an -OH proton. So maybe it's a carboxylic acid.

But wait, the other substituents on the benzene ring. The aromatic protons are in two doublets. So perhaps the benzene ring has two substitu
