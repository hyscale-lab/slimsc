Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I remember that red phosphorus and HI are typically used in the Clemmensen reduction. Clemmensen reduction is used to reduce ketones to alkanes. So, if I can figure out what Compound X is, I can predict what the product would be after this reaction.

But first, I need to analyze the given spectral data to determine the structure of Compound X.

Looking at the IR data: The peaks are at 3400–2500 cm-1, which usually indicates O-H stretches, maybe an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. But wait, the 1720 cm-1 peak is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. That could be a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid. The 1610 and 1450 cm-1 might be aromatic C=C stretches. So, maybe the compound has an aromatic ring and a carbonyl group. Also, the broad peak in the IR around 3400 suggests maybe an acidic proton, like a carboxylic acid. But wait, if it's a ketone, maybe that's not the case.

Looking at the 1H NMR data:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): That's a very high chemical shift. For a proton, that's probably an aldehyde proton, but wait, aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm. Alternatively, it could be a carboxylic acid proton. But carboxylic acids are broad because they're usually exchanging protons, which fits the 'bs' (broad singlet). But if it's an aldehyde, the peak is typically a triplet or split due to coupling, but sometimes it's a singlet if it's isolated. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's an acidic proton like in a phenol, but phenol protons are around 5 ppm usually, so 10.5 seems higher.

Wait, the 1720 cm-1 in IR is a strong peak. So, it's definitely a carbonyl. So if the compound has a carbonyl, like a ketone or a carboxylic acid.

Wait, the 10.5 ppm in NMR could be a carboxylic acid proton. Carboxylic acids have a broad peak around 10-12 ppm. So that fits. So the structure might have a COOH group.

Wait, but wait. The other peaks: 8.0 ppm (d, 2H), 7.2 ppm (d, 2H) – that looks like a para-substituted aromatic ring. Because two doublets with 2H each suggests a para arrangement. So if the aromatic ring has two substituents, one at position 4 and another at position 1? Wait, no, maybe it's a para-substituted, so two substituents opposite each other. Like a benzene ring with substituents
