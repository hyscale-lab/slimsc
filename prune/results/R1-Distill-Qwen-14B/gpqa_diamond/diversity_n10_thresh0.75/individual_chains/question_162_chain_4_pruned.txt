Okay, so I've got this question in front of me about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity and differential geometry, but let me try to think through this.

The metric given is ds² = 32/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, that looks familiar. I remember that metrics can describe different kinds of spaces, like spheres or hyperboloids, depending on their form.

So the question is asking about the area of a pseudosphere of radius r=2. Oh wait, pseudosphere isn't a standard term I hear every day. I think it refers to a surface with constant negative curvature, like a hyperbolic surface. So it's like the opposite of a sphere which has positive curvature.

First, I need to figure out what kind of geometry this metric represents. The metric has a denominator (4 - x² - y²), which looks similar to the metric for a sphere. For a sphere of radius a, the metric in 3D is usually something like a²/(a² - r²) dr² + r² dθ², but this is in 2D, I think. Wait, this metric is written in terms of dx² + dy², so it's a 2D metric.

Wait, let me correct that. The metric given is (dx² + dy²) multiplied by a factor. So in two dimensions, this is a line element. So perhaps this is describing a surface embedded in some higher dimension, but the metric itself is 2D.

Wait, so the general form for a surface of revolution with a specific metric... Maybe it's a hyperboloid. Because for a sphere, the metric would have a denominator that's (a² - r²), but for a hyperboloid, I think it would be (a² + r²) or something similar. Let me think: the metric for a hyperboloid of one sheet is something like ds² = (R² + r²)/(R² - r²) dr² + r² dθ², or maybe the other way around. Hmm, not exactly sure.

Wait, another approach: the given metric is for a 2D surface, and the area element is found by taking the square root of the determinant of the metric tensor times dx dy. So the area should be the integral of sqrt(det g) dx dy over the region.

The metric here is diagonal, so the determinant is the product of the (1,1) and (2,2) components. Let's compute that.

So the metric components are g_xx = 32/(4 - x² - y²) and g_yy = 32/(4 - x² - y²), since the cross terms are zero. So det g = g_xx * g_yy = [32/(4 - x² - y²)]².

But wait, the area element is sqrt(det g) dx dy. So sqrt(det g) would be 32/(4 - x² - y²). So the area A is the integral over the region where the metric is defined of [32/(4 - x² - y²)] dx dy.

Wait, but what is the region of integration? The denominator 4 - x² - y² must not be zero, so 4 - (x² +
