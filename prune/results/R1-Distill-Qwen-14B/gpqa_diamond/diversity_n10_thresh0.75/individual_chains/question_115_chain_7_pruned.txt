Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll give it a shot.

Alright, the problem says that an electron and a positron are moving along the horizontal axis. The electron is moving from the left, and the positron from the right. Their Lorentz factors are 4 and 2, respectively. After they collide, they annihilate into two photons. The photons have the same energy, and their directions are upper-right and lower-right. I need to find the angle between their directions.

Hmm, so first, I remember that when particles annihilate, they produce photons. Since an electron and a positron are colliding, their rest mass energy is converted into energy for the photons. Also, since they're moving, there's kinetic energy involved too, right? But wait, the problem says the photons have the same energy. That's an important point.

Wait, but wait. I think when particles annihilate, the total energy and momentum must be conserved. So I'll need to apply conservation laws here. Let me think about it.

The initial setup: electron moving left to right (let's say positive x-direction) with Lorentz factor γ_e =4, and positron moving right to left (negative x-direction) with γ_p=2. Wait, no, the positron is moving from the right, so it's going to the left, same direction as the electron? Wait no, no. No, wait. The electron is moving from the left along the horizontal axis, so its direction is to the right. The positron is moving from the right, so its direction is to the left. Oh right, so their velocities are in opposite directions along the x-axis.

So their velocities are opposite. Let me note that down. The electron has velocity v_e = β_e * c, and the positron has v_p = β_p * c, but in the opposite direction. So for the positron, its velocity is -β_p c. Wait, but wait: Lorentz factor is γ = 1/sqrt(1 - β²), so for the electron, γ_e=4, and the positron γ_p=2.

But wait, when they collide, they annihilate. So the initial momentum and energy would be the sum of their relativistic momenta and energies.

So for conservation of energy and momentum, the total energy before annihilation equals the total
