Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about paramagnetic coupling and the hydrogen atom's transition energy. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The question says that the magnetic field B is parallel to the Oz axis. Oh wait, Oz is the z-axis, right? So the field is pointing along z. And the orbital magnetic quantum number m has small values. Oh, because m is the z-component of the orbital angular momentum, its values are -l, ..., 0, ..., +l. Small m, maybe m=0 or 1, I guess.

The problem compares the paramagnetic coupling term's expectation value ⟨H⟩ with the transition energy ΔE of hydrogen. The wavelength given is 0.4861 micrometers. Wait, that's the wavelength for a specific transition in hydrogen, maybe the Balmer series? Oh right, the Balmer-alpha line is about 656 nm, but wait, 0.4861 micrometers is 486 nm, which is the Balmer-beta line, right? So the transition is from n=4 to n=2, I think. So the energy difference ΔE is associated with that photon.

Paramagnetic coupling... I think that refers to the Zeeman effect, where an external magnetic field splits the energy levels of an atom. The coupling term is the Hamiltonian due to the magnetic field. The paramagnetic term is usually the term involving the spin-orbit coupling, but wait, maybe it's the orbital contribution here. Or is it the spin part? Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Wait, the paramagnetic term is usually the spin part, but in the absence of spin-orbit coupling, maybe it's the orbital contribution. Oh wait, the magnetic dipole interaction energy is given by H = -μ·B. For orbitals, the magnetic moment is μ = (e/(2m)) * L, so the energy is proportional to L·B.

But for the hydrogen atom, the orbital magnetic quantum number m comes into play. So the expectation value ⟨H⟩ for the paramagnetic term would be proportional to m times B. Because L_z has eigenvalues mħ, so L_z B would be proportional to m B.

Now, for small m, let's say m is 1. So the expectation value would be something like μ_B * m * B, where μ_B is the Bohr magneton. Let me calculate the order of magnitude.

The Bohr magneton μ_B is about 9.274×10^-24 J/T. And B is 1 Tesla here. So for m=1, ⟨H⟩ would be μ_B * (m) * B. Wait, no, the magnetic dipole energy is H = -μ·B. So for orbital angular momentum, the energy is H = (e/(2m)) * L_z * B. But L_z is mħ, so H = (e/(2m)) * mħ B. Wait, e is the charge, m is the mass of the electron, ħ is h-bar. So substituting, H = (e/(2m)) * m * ħ B * (1/m_e c^2?) Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me just remember that the energy shift from the Zeeman effect is given by E_Zeeman = μ_B * m * B, where μ_B is the Bohr magneton.

So for m=1, E ≈ 9.27e-24 J/T * 1 * 1 T = 9.27e-24 J. Now, what's the transition energy ΔE of the hydrogen atom with wavelength 0.4861 μm (486 nm)? Let's compute that.

The energy of a photon is E = hc/λ. h is Planck's constant, 6.626e-34 J·s. c is speed of light, 3e8 m/s. λ is 486e-9 meters (since 1 nm is 1e-9 m). So E_photon = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (486e-9) = Let me compute that:

6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25. Divide by 486e-9 m: 1.9878e-25 /486e-9 = approx 4.089e-18 J. Wait, wait, let me calculate that more accurately.

Wait, 486e-9 is 4.86e-7 meters. So 1.9878e-25 / 4.86e-7 = let's compute: 1.9878 /
