Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a meson resonance and its decay distance. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to think this through.

The question gives me some numbers: production energy E_X is 8 GeV, mass m_X is 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X is 320 MeV. And the options are all in the order of 10^-15 or 10^-16 meters. I remember that decay distance has something to do with the particle's lifetime and the speed at which it's moving.

Wait, the decay distance is the average distance a particle travels before decaying. The formula I remember is something like c multiplied by the lifetime (τ). But how do I get the lifetime from the given parameters?

Oh right, the width Γ is related to the lifetime by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. The uncertainty in energy ΔE times the uncertainty in time Δt is about ħ/2. But for a particle, the width Γ is like the uncertainty in energy, and the mean lifetime τ is related as Γ = ħ / τ. So τ is ħ divided by Γ. Right, because Γ represents the decay rate, which is inversely proportional to lifetime.

So first, I need to calculate the lifetime τ. Let's note the constants I'll need. Planck's constant ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. Oh wait, because Γ is in MeV, I should convert it to GeV to match units. Γ_X is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV.

So τ = ħ / Γ. Plugging in the numbers: τ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / 0.32 GeV. Let me compute that. 6.582 divided by 0.32 is... Let me compute 6.582 / 0.32. 0.32 goes into 6.582 about 20.56875 times. So τ ≈ 20.56875e-25 seconds. Wait, wait, no—because 6.582 / 0.32 is about 20.56875. So 20.56875 times 1e-25 seconds? Wait, no: 6.582e-25 GeV·s divided by 0.32 GeV gives 6.582e-25 / 0.32 s. So 6.582 / 0.32 is approximately 20.56875, so τ ≈ 20.56875e-25 s? Wait, that can't be right because 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32 is 20.56875e-25? Wait, no, wait a second. 6.582e-25 / 0.32 is (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25, which is 20.56875e-25 s. So that's 2.056875e-24 seconds? Wait, no, 20.56875e-25 is the same as 2.056875e-24 s. Hmm, that seems long for a particle lifetime, but I might be getting confused. Wait, maybe I should think in terms of proper time, which is the lifetime in the particle's rest frame.

But wait, the decay distance isn't just c times τ. Because the particle will be moving at a relativistic speed. So the mean decay length is L = γ c τ, where γ is the Lorentz factor. Oh right, because from the lab frame, the particle is moving, so its lifetime is longer due to time dilation.

So I need to find the Lorentz factor γ. γ is E / (m c²), but wait, E is the energy. But wait,
