Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The question says that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh wait, and the energy difference between these levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. They also mention that the photospheres are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), which I remember means that the gas behaves according to classical thermodynamic laws, so I can probably use the Boltzmann distribution here.

The Boltzmann equation relates the number of particles in two energy states to the temperature. The formula is something like N2/N1 = exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k*T) ), right? Since E2 is higher than E1 (because it's an excited state), E2 - E1 is positive. So if star_1 has twice as many excited atoms, that ratio N2/N1 would be 2 for star_1 and 1 for star_2. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. Oh, wait, the ratio for star_1 is 2, meaning N2/N1 for star_1 is 2. For star_2, the ratio is 1 because it's less excited, so N2/N1 is 1. So each star has a different ratio based on their temperature.

So let me write the equations. For star 1: 2 = exp( - ΔE/(k T1) ), and for star 2: 1 = exp( - ΔE/(k T2) ). But wait, wait—no, because the energy level for the excited state is higher. So the ratio is (number in higher level)/(number in lower level). So for star_1, 2 = exp( - ΔE/(k T1) ), and for star_2, 1 = exp( - ΔE/(k T2) ). 

Wait, but wait, I'm getting confused. The Boltzmann factor is actually (n_j)/(n_i) = exp( -(E_j - E_i)/(k T) ). So if the energy is higher for j, then E_j - E_i is positive. So for the excited state, j is higher. So for star_1, the ratio is 2, so 2 = exp( -
