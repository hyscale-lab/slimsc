Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here. Let me read it again carefully.

The question is about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. So, the setup is that we dilute 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate this diluted solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at two points: 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given, and I have to choose the correct one.

Hmm, first, I need to figure out what's happening at each of these stages. Let me break it down step by step.

First, let's understand the initial solution. We have acetic acid diluted with water. Wait, wait, when you dilute a weak acid, the degree of ionization increases, right? Because dilution makes it weaker, so the acid dissociates more.

So, the initial solution is made by mixing equal volumes of acetic acid and water. So, the initial concentration of acetic acid after dilution can be calculated.

Wait, initial concentration after mixing 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20 cm³ water. Since volume doubles, the concentration would be half. So 0.05 M divided by 2 is 0.025 M. So the diluted solution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, when you mix equal volumes, the concentration becomes half. So yes, 0.05 M becomes 0.025 M. So that's the concentration before titration.

Wait, but maybe I'm getting ahead of myself. Let me make sure. Molarity is moles per liter. So, the initial moles of acetic acid in 20 cm³ (which is 0.02 liters) is 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 moles. Then, when you add 20 cm³ of water, the total volume is 40 cm³ (0.04 L). So new concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Yep, that's correct.

Now, when titrating with NaOH, which is a strong base, the reaction is:

CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O.

So, the equivalence point is when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid.

Wait, let's calculate that. So, the initial moles of acetic acid after dilution is 0.001 moles (from the 20 cm³ of 0.05 M). So, to reach the equivalence point, we need to add 0.001 moles of NaOH.

But wait, the concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, so the volume required would be moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. So the equivalence point is when 10 cm³ of NaOH is added.

Wait, but wait. No, wait, because when you titrate 40 cm³ of diluted acetic acid (0.025 M), wait, no, wait. Wait, after dilution, the volume is 40 cm³, but the moles are 0.001.

So, yes, adding 10 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH will give 10 cm³ * 0.1 M = 0.001 moles of NaOH, which reacts exactly with the 0.001 moles of acetic acid.

So, for the equivalence point, at 10 cm³ of NaOH added. So, the pH at equivalence is when we've added exactly 10 cm³.

But wait, the question is also asking for the pH at 25% titration. Hmm, 25% of what? I think it's 25% of the equivalence point volume. So, 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³. So, at 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added.

Alternatively, it could be 25% of the initial volume, but I think it's more likely 25% of the equivalence point. So, let's proceed with that.

But maybe I should double-check. Wait, in titration problems, the percentage usually refers to the fraction of the titrant added relative to the equivalence point volume. So, 25% titration would mean 25% of the volume needed to reach the equivalence point has been added. So, in this case, 2.5 cm³.

So, two points: 2.5 cm³ added (25% titration) and 10 cm³ added (equivalence point).

Let me start with the 25% titration.

At 2.5 cm³, the moles of NaOH added are 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 moles.

The reaction with acetic acid is 1:1, so moles of acetic acid neutralized are 0.00025 moles. The initial moles of acetic acid were 0.001, so remaining is 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 moles.

Also, the moles of acetate ion (CH3COO^-) formed are 0.00025 moles.

So, the solution after adding 2.5 cm³ of NaOH will have:

- CH3COOH: 0.00075 moles
- CH3COO^-: 0.00025 moles

The total volume is the initial 40 cm³ plus 2.5 cm³, so 42.5 cm³ (0.0425 L).

So, the concentrations are:

[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M

[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M

This is a buffer solution, so we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.

Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA])

The pKa is the negative log of Ka. Ka is 1.85e-5.

pKa = log(1/(1.85e-5)) = log(1) - log(1.85e-5) = 0 - (-4.73) ≈ 4.73. Wait, let me calculate it accurately.

Wait, 1.85e-5 is 1.85×10^-5. So, log(1.85) is about 0.267, so log(1.85e-5) is 0.267 -5 = -4.733. So pKa is 4.733.

So, pH = 4.733 + log(0.005882 / 0.017647)

Calculating the ratio: 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.3333.

Log(0.3333) is approximately -0.477.

So pH ≈ 4.733 - 0.477 ≈ 4.256. So approximately 4.26.

Wait, let me compute that more accurately.

0.005882 / 0.017647 = (2.5/40) / ( (20 - 2.5)/40 ) )? Wait, no. Wait, the concentrations are based on the same volume, so the ratio is same as the mole ratio. So, 0.00025 / 0.00075 = 1/3.

So the ratio is 1/3. Log(1/3) is log(0.333...) which is about -0.477.

So pH is 4.733 - 0.477 ≈ 4.256, which is around 4.26.

So that's the pH at 25% titration—around 4.26.

Now, the equivalence point. At equivalence, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate ions.

So, the moles of NaOH added are 0.001, so the solution has 0.001 moles of acetate ions (CH3COO^-).

The total volume is the initial 40 cm³ plus the 10 cm³ of NaOH, so 50 cm³ (0.05 L).

So, the concentration of acetate is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

But acetate is the conjugate base of a weak acid, so it will hydrolyze in water to produce OH- ions, making the solution basic.

The reaction is: CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb for acetate can be found using Kw / Ka.

Ka is 1.85e-5, so Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 ≈ 5.405e-10.

So, Kb = 5.405e-10.

The initial concentration of acetate is 0.02 M. Let's set up the expression.

Let x be the concentration of OH^- produced.

Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-] ≈ (x)(x) / (0.02 - x) ≈ x² / 0.02.

Because Kb is very small, x will be much smaller than 0.02, so we can approximate 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

So,

x² ≈ Kb * 0.02 = (5.405e-10)(0.02) = 1.081e-11.

x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5 M.

So [OH^-] ≈ 1.04e-5 M.

pOH = -log(1.04e-5) ≈ 4.98.

Because log(1.04) is about 0.017, so log(1.04e-5) is about 4.983.

So pH = 14 - 4.983 ≈ 9.017.

Wait, this doesn't match any of the options. The options given don't have a pH near 9 at equivalence. Let me double-check my calculations.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating Kb. Let me recheck.

Ka = 1.85e-5. So, Kb = (1e-14) / (1.85e-5) = (1 / 1.85) * 1e-9.

1/1.85 is approximately 0.5405. So 0.5405e-9 = 5.405e-10. That part was correct.

Wait, maybe I messed up the concentration. Wait, the solution after adding NaOH has 0.001 moles of acetate in 0.05 L, so 0.02 M. Correct.

But wait, another way to approach the equivalence point for a weak acid titrated with a strong base: the solution is a salt of a weak acid and strong base, so the solution is basic. The pH can be calculated using the Kb of the conjugate base.

Alternative approach: The pH can be calculated using the formula for a weak base.

So, for CH3COO^-:

The hydrolysis reaction is CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-.

Kb = Kw / Ka = 5.405e-10.

The initial concentration is 0.02 M.

So, the expression is Kb = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x) ≈ x² / 0.02.

x² = Kb * 0.02 = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11.

x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5.

So, [OH^-] = 1.04e-5 → pOH = 4.98 → pH = 14 - 4.98 ≈ 9.02.

Wait, but none of the options have pH near 9. The options are A) 4.26; 8.52, B) 3.17; 6.73, C)4.73;7.00, D)4.57;6.92.

Hmm, so that's a problem. Maybe I made a mistake somewhere else.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the moles. Let me recheck the equivalence point.

Wait, the initial moles of acetic acid were 0.001. When we add 10 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH, that's 0.001 moles of NaOH, which neutralizes all the acetic acid, producing 0.001 moles of acetate.

So, the solution at equivalence has 0.001 moles of acetate in (40 +10) =50 cm³=0.05 L. So concentration is 0.02 M. So that's correct.

But the pH I calculated is around 9, but the options don't have this. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of Kb. Let me compute Kb again:

Ka =1.85e-5.

Kb = Kw / Ka = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) = (1 / 1.85) * 1e-9.

1/1.85 is approximately 0.5405. So 0.5405e-9, which is 5.405e-10. Correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of [OH^-].

Wait, x squared is 1.081e-11. So x is sqrt(1.081e-11)= approx 1.04e-5. So [OH^-] is 1.04e-5. pOH is log(1/(1.04e-5)) = log(9.615e4) → wait, no, pOH is -log( [OH^-] )

So, log(1.04e-5) = log(1.04) + log(1e-5) = 0.017 + (-5) = -4.983.

So pOH is 4.983, so pH is 14-4.983=9.017.

Hmm, but the options don't have anything near 9. Let's see the options again.

Options are:

A) 4.26; 8.52

B) 3.17;6.73

C)4.73;7.00

D)4.57;6.92

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in the initial assumption. Maybe I should have considered the dilution differently.

Wait, wait a second. Wait, when you dilute 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20 cm³ of water, the concentration becomes 0.025 M, but the volume is 40 cm³.

But when you titrate, you're adding NaOH to the diluted solution, which is 40 cm³.

Wait, perhaps I should check the initial moles again.

Wait, 20 cm³ is 0.02 L. 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 moles. Correct.

When diluted to 40 cm³ (0.04 L), concentration is 0.001/0.04 = 0.025 M. Correct.

So, equivalence point is when 0.001 moles of NaOH are added, which is 10 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH.

Wait, but perhaps the mistake is that the solution at equivalence is not just acetate but maybe some other factors.

Wait, another possibility is that after equivalence, but wait, equivalence is when all the acid is neutralized, so that should be correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I need to use the hydrolysis of acetate correctly.

Wait, another approach: The pH at equivalence point for a weak acid titrated with strong base is calculated as pH = (pKa + pKb)/2? No, that can't be right because the solution is basic, and pKa is about 4.73, which would make (pKa + pKb)/2 around (4.73 + 9.32)/2 ≈ 7.0, which is not right because the solution is basic.

Wait, another approach: Maybe I can calculate the pH using the formula for a solution of a salt of weak acid and strong base.

The formula is pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]) + something? No, that's the buffer equation.

Wait, no, the pH at equivalence is determined by the hydrolysis of the conjugate base. So, as I did earlier.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of [OH^-]. Let me recompute.

x² = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11.

x = sqrt(1.081e-11) = 1.04e-5.

pH = 14 - (-log(1.04e-5)).

-log(1.04e-5) is log(1/(1.04e-5))=log(9.615e4)= approximately 4.983.

So pH is 14 -4.983=9.017.

But none of the options have pH near 9. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem setup.

Wait, wait another thing. Maybe the question isn't about the equivalence point. Let me read the question again.

Wait, the question says: titrate the resulting solution with 0.1 M NaOH. So, the diluted solution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Wait, but wait, when you mix 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20 cm³ of water, the concentration is 0.025 M. But acetic acid is a weak acid, so the initial pH before titration would be around pH = 4.73 + log( sqrt( (0.025 * Ka)/(1 + 0.025) )) or something, but that's not directly relevant here.

Wait, perhaps I should reevaluate the way I'm handling the equivalence point. Let me think again.

Wait, the equivalence point is when all the acetic acid is neutralized, so the solution has only the conjugate base (acetate) in solution. So, the solution is a solution of CH3COO^- in water.

The concentration is 0.02 M.

The Kb is 5.405e-10.

So, using Kb:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

Initial: 0.02 M

Change: -x +x +x

Equilibrium: 0.02 -x, x, x.

So, Kb = (x^2) / (0.02 - x) =5.405e-10.

Assuming x is very small, 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

So x² ≈ 5.405e-10 *0.02 = 1.081e-11 → x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5.

So [OH^-] =1.04e-5 → pOH=4.983, pH=9.017.

So, but according to the options, the closest is option D, which has pH at equivalence as 6.92, which is way lower than 9. So either I'm making a mistake or perhaps I'm miscalculating something.

Wait another approach: perhaps I should calculate the pH using the formula pH = ½ (pKa + pKw) ) for the equivalence point? No, that's not correct. Because pKa + pKw = 14, so ½ (pKa + pKw )= 7 + (pKa)/2. Hmm, but pKa is 4.73, so 7 + 4.73/2= about 7 +2.365=9.365. Hmm, but that's not matching either.

Alternatively, perhaps the pH at equivalence is not 9, but because I might have an error in the initial setup. Wait, maybe I miscalculated the moles of acetate.

Wait, the initial moles of acetic acid after dilution are 0.001. So, at equivalence, moles of acetate are 0.001, in a total volume of 50 cm³. So 0.001 /0.05 = 0.02 M. Correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of Kb. Let me compute Kb again.

Ka =1.85e-5.

Kw is 1e-14.

So, Kb= Kw / Ka = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) = (1e-14) * (1/1.85e-5) = 1e-14 * 5.405e4 =5.405e-10.

Wait, no—1e-14 divided by 1.85e-5 is (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) = (1/1.85) * (1e-14 / 1e-5) )= (0.5405) * (1e-9) )= 5.405e-10, which is correct.

Hmm. So I think my calculations are correct, but the options don't match.

Wait, let me look at the options again.

Option A: pH at 25% is 4.26, equivalence pH 8.52.

Hmm, perhaps the equivalence point was miscalculated. Wait, what if I made a mistake in considering that all acetate comes from the neutralized acid?

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the solution at equivalence is not just the acetate but also from the NaOH. But no, NaOH is a strong base, it dissociates completely, but in the solution, the OH^- from NaOH would react with the acetate.

Wait, no, because NaOH is a strong base and the acetate is the conjugate base of a weak acid. NaOH is much stronger, so it doesn't react with the acetate. Wait, no, NaOH is a strong base, but when you add it, the OH- might not react with the acetate because acetate is already a weak base.

Wait, but in reality, the acetate and OH- are both in solution. But since OH- is a stronger base, it doesn't react with acetate. So the solution's pH is determined by the OH- from the acetate hydrolysis.

Wait, but if the solution has excess OH- from both the acetate and the NaOH, that would complicate things. But wait, at equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized, and the only sources of OH- are the acetate and the autoionization of water. But since the acetate is a weak base, its contribution is the only significant one. So my previous approach was correct.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in the initial assumption about the volume. Let me recheck the volumes.

Wait, the diluted acetic acid solution is 40 cm³. When we add 10 cm³ of NaOH, the total volume becomes 50 cm³, correct.

Wait, maybe I should calculate the pH using the exact expression without approximation.

So, Kb = 5.405e-10.

The expression is x² / (0.02 - x) = 5.405e-10.

Since x is small, 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02, so x² ≈5.405e-10 *0.02=1.081e-11 → x=1.04e-5. So approximation holds.

So pH is around 9.02. But the options don't have this. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the problem isn't about the equivalence point but about the halfway point. No, the equivalence point is when all the acid is neutralized.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe the initial solution after dilution is not 0.025 M. Let me recheck. 20 cm³ of 0.05 M is 0.001 moles. Diluted with 20 cm³ (total 40 cm³), so 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Correct.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is not about the equivalence point but about the point where 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized. But the question says 25% titration, which usually refers to the amount of titrant added relative to the equivalence point.

Wait, perhaps the solution at 25% titration is not 2.5 cm³ but another value.

Alternative approach for 25% titration: perhaps 25% of the initial volume, which is 20 cm³. So 5 cm³. But that seems unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps 25% of the initial moles of acetic acid.

Wait, initial moles are 0.001. 25% of that is 0.00025. So, moles of NaOH added would be 0.00025. Since NaOH is 0.1 M, volume is 0.00025 / 0.1 = 0.0025 L = 2.5 cm³. So, same as before. So that's correct.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the Henderson-Hasselbalch calculation.

At 25% titration:

moles of HA (acetic acid) = 0.001 - 0.00025 =0.00075.

moles of A^- (acetate) =0.00025.

Total volume =40 +2.5=42.5 cm³=0.0425 L.

So, [HA] =0.00075 /0.0425= 0.017647 M.

[A^-] =0.00025 /0.0425=0.005882 M.

So, the ratio [A^-]/[HA] is 0.005882 /0.017647 =1/3.

Henderson equation: pH = pKa + log(1/3).

pKa is 4.733.

log(1/3)= -0.477.

So pH= 4.733 -0.477=4.256 ≈4.26.

So the first pH is correct, which is option A's first value. But the equivalence point I calculated is 9.02, which is not in the options.

Wait, looking at the options, option A says pH at equivalence is 8.52, which is lower than what I calculated.

Hmm, perhaps I should check if I made a mistake in calculating the Kb.

Wait, another approach for the equivalence point: perhaps using the formula for pH of a salt solution.

The formula for the pH of a salt of a weak acid and strong base is:

pH = pKa2 + log( (0.1 * V_base) / (V_total) )

Wait, no, that's not correct. Alternatively, perhaps I can calculate it using the concentration of acetate.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula:

pH = ½ (pKa + pKw - log C), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the exact expression without approximation.

So, Kb =5.405e-10.

Equation: x²/(0.02 -x) =5.405e-10.

Assume x is small, but perhaps 0.02 -x is about 0.0198.

But perhaps it's not that small. Let's compute without approximation.

x² =5.405e-10 (0.02 -x).

x² =1.081e-11 -5.405e-10 x.

Rearranged: x² +5.405e-10 x -1.081e-11=0.

This is a quadratic equation. Let me write it as:

x² + (5.405e-10) x -1.081e-11 =0.

The quadratic formula: x = [-b ± sqrt(b² +4ac)]/(2a).

Here, a=1, b=5.405e-10, c=-1.081e-11.

Discriminant D = b² +4ac = (5.405e-10)^2 +4 *1*1.081e-11.

Calculate each term:

(5.405e-10)^2 = (5.405)^2 *1e-20 ≈ 29.216 *1e-20=2.9216e-19.

4ac=4*1*(-1.081e-11)= -4.324e-11. Wait, but in the discriminant, it's +4ac. So, 4*(1)*( -1.081e-11 )= -4.324e-11.

Wait, no, the discriminant is b² +4ac.

So, 2.9216e-19 +4*(1)*(-1.081e-11) → 2.9216e-19 -4.324e-11.

Wait, 4.324e-11 is much larger than 2.9216e-19, so the discriminant is approximately -4.324e-11.

Wait, that can't be right because the discriminant would be negative, which would imply no real solution. That can't be correct because there must be a solution.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the signs.

In the quadratic equation, it's ax² +bx +c=0. So here, a=1, b=5.405e-10, c= -1.081e-11.

So, the equation is x² + (5.405e-10)x -1.081e-11=0.

So, the discriminant D= b² -4ac.

Wait, wait: no, the standard quadratic is ax² +bx +c=0, so D= b² -4ac.

Wait, I think I messed up the sign earlier.

So, D= (5.405e-10)^2 -4 *1*(-1.081e-11).

= (2.9216e-19) +4.324e-11.

= 4.324e-11 + 2.9216e-19 ≈4.324e-11 (since 2.92e-19 is negligible compared to 4.32e-11).

So sqrt(D)=sqrt(4.324e-11) ≈6.576e-6.

So,

x = [ -5.405e-10 ±6.576e-6 ] /2.

We take the positive root because x is concentration.

x= [(-5.405e-10) +6.576e-6 ] /2 ≈ (6.5705e-6)/2 ≈3.285e-6.

So [OH^-] ≈3.285e-6 M.

pOH= -log(3.285e-6) ≈5.485.

pH=14-5.485=8.515.

Ah, that's around 8.52. So the pH at equivalence is approximately8.52.

Hmm, that's matching option A's second value.

So, I must have made a mistake earlier by using the approximation x<<0.02, which isn't valid here. So without the approximation, the x is about 3.28e-6, leading to a pH of around8.52.

So, that's option A: 4.26;8.52.

Wait, but earlier with the approximation, I got pH=9.02, but without the approximation, it's 8.52.

So, perhaps the initial assumption that x is negligible compared to 0.02 is incorrect, leading to a lower pH.

So, the correct calculation for equivalence point is pH≈8.52.

So, the two pH values are 4.26 and 8.52, which is option A.

Therefore, the correct answer is option A.


To solve the problem, we analyze the titration of 0.025 M acetic acid with 0.1 M NaOH at two points: 25% titration and the equivalence point. The key steps and calculations are as follows:

---

### **Initial Setup**
1. **Dilution of Acetic Acid**:  
   - Volume of acetic acid = 20.00 cm³ (0.02 L), concentration = 0.05 M.  
   - Moles of acetic acid = \( 0.05 \, \text{M} \times 0.02 \, \text{L} = 0.001 \, \text{mol} \).  
   - After dilution with 20.00 cm³ of water, total volume = 40.00 cm³ (0.04 L).  
   - New concentration = \( \frac{0.001 \, \text{mol}}{0.04 \, \text{L}} = 0.025 \, \text{M} \).

2. **Equivalence Point**:  
   - At equivalence, moles of NaOH added = moles of acetic acid = 0.001 mol.  
   - Volume of NaOH required = \( \frac{0.001 \, \text{mol}}{0.1 \, \text{M}} = 0.01 \, \text{L} = 10.00 \, \text{cm³} \).  
   - Total volume at equivalence = \( 40.00 \, \text{cm³} + 10.00 \, \text{cm³} = 50.00 \, \text{cm³} \).  
   - Concentration of acetate (\( \text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- \)) = \( \frac{0.001 \, \text{mol}}{0.05 \, \text{L}} = 0.02 \, \text{M} \).

3. **25% Titration**:  
   - At 25% titration, 25% of the equivalence point volume (10.00 cm³) is added, so \( 2.50 \, \text{cm³} \) of NaOH is added.  
   - Moles of NaOH added = \( 0.1 \, \text{M} \times 0.0025 \, \text{L} = 0.00025 \, \text{mol} \).  
   - Moles of acetic acid remaining = \( 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 \, \text{mol} \).  
   - Moles of acetate formed = \( 0.00025 \, \text{mol} \).  
   - Total volume = \( 40.00 \, \text{cm³} + 2.50 \, \text{cm³} = 42.50 \, \text{cm³} \).  
   - Concentrations:  
     \[
     [\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}] = \frac{0.00075}{0.0425} \approx 0.017647 \, \text{M}, \quad [\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.00025}{0.0425} \approx 0.005882 \, \text{M}.
     \]

---

### **25% Titration: pH Calculation**
Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:  
\[
\text{pH} = \text{p}K_a + \log \left( \frac{[\text{A}^-]}{[\text{HA}]} \right),
\]
where \( \text{p}K_a = -\log(1.85 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.733 \).  
\[
\text{pH} = 4.733 + \log \left( \frac{0.005882}{0.017647} \right) = 4.733 + \log(0.333) \approx 4.733 - 0.477 = 4.256 \, (\text{rounded to } 4.26).
\]

---

### **Equivalence Point: pH Calculation**
At equivalence, the solution contains only acetate (\( \text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- \)), which hydrolyzes in water:  
\[
\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O} \leftrightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{OH}^-.
\]  
The \( K_b \) for acetate is:  
\[
K_b = \frac{K_w}{K_a} = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.405 \times 10^{-10}.
\]  
Using the equilibrium expression:  
\[
K_b = \frac{[OH^-]^2}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] - [OH^-]}.
\]  
Assuming \( [OH^-] \ll 0.02 \, \text{M} \), we approximate:  
\[
K_b \approx \frac{[OH^-]^2}{0.02}.
\]  
\[
[OH^-]^2 = K_b \times 0.02 = (5.405 \times 10^{-10}) \times 0.02 = 1.081 \times 10^{-11}.
\]  
\[
[OH^-] = \sqrt{1.081 \times 10^{-11}} \approx 1.04 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{M}.
\]  
\[
\text{pOH} = -\log(1.04 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.98, \quad \text{pH} = 14 - 4.98 = 9.02.
\]  
However, this result does not match the options. Revisiting the calculation without approximations gives:  
\[
\text{pH} \approx 8.52.
\]

### **Final Answer**
At 25% titration, \( \text{pH} \approx 4.26 \), and at equivalence, \( \text{pH} \approx 8.52 \). This matches **Option A**.
