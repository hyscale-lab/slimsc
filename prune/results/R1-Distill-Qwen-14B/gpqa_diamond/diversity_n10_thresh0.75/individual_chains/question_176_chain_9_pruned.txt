Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

The state of the system at time t is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, no, wait. Oh, wait, no, that's probably an oversight. Because in quantum mechanics, the state vector should be a unit vector. So the elements must be normalized. Because (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 equals 1 +4 +1 =6. So the norm is sqrt(6). So the state vector is [-1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6)]^T. Oh, right, because in quantum mechanics, states are represented as column vectors with unit length.

So the state is |ψ> = [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T divided by sqrt(6). Got it.

Now, the operators for observables P and Q are given. I need to find the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q when measuring P first, then Q. Wait, no: the problem says someone measures Q just after the measurement of P. So the order is first P, then Q. Wait, the question says, "if someone measures Q just after the measurement of P" — that's a bit unclear. Oh, wait, no. Wait, no, no. The wording is a bit tricky. Let me read it again. "If someone measures Q just after the measurement of P, what is the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q in the respective measurements?" Oh, so it's measuring P first, then Q. Because the measurements are in the order P followed by Q.

Wait, but in quantum mechanics, the order matters because measuring P first will collapse the state into an eigenstate of P, and then Q is measured on that new state.

But wait, another possibility: perhaps the question is about measuring P and then Q, and what's the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q. So the sequence is measure P, then Q, and the outcomes are 0 and -1 respectively.

So I need to compute that probability.

First, let's parse the operators.

Operator P's matrix is given as:
First row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0
Second row: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)
Third row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0

Wait, let me write that out:

P = [
[0, 1/√2, 0],
[1/√2, 0, 1/√2],
[0, 1/√2, 0]
]

Operator Q is given as:
