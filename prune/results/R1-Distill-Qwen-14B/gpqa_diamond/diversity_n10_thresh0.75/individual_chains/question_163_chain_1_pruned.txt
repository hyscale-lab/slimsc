Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me see what the question is asking.

The problem states: We need to dissolve 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm³ of solution. We're supposed to find the minimum volume of a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid required to prepare this solution, and also determine the pH of the resulting solution.

Hmm. So, Fe(OH)3 is a hydroxide, right? And a strong acid will react with it. I remember that when a hydroxide reacts with a strong acid, they neutralize each other, producing water and a salt. So the reaction should be something like Fe(OH)3 + HCl → FeCl3 + 3 H2O. Since HCl is a monobasic strong acid, each mole of HCl provides one mole of H+ ions.

First, I think I need to calculate how many moles of Fe(OH)3 we have. The molar mass of Fe(OH)3 would be helpful here. Let's calculate that. Iron (Fe) has an atomic mass of about 55.85 g/mol. Oxygen (O) is 16 g/mol, and Hydrogen (H) is 1 g/mol. So for Fe(OH)3, it's Fe + 3(OH). That would be 55.85 + 3*(16 + 1) = 55.85 + 3*17 = 55.85 +51= 106.85 g/mol.

So the moles of Fe(OH)3 is mass divided by molar mass. Mass is 0.1 grams. So 0.1 / 106.85 ≈ approximately 0.000936 moles. Let me double-check that math. 106.85 times 0.000936 is around 0.1, so that seems right.

Wait, wait, 0.1 divided by 106.85 is actually approximately 0.000936 mol. So Fe(OH)3 → Fe^3+ + 3 OH^-. So each mole of Fe(OH)3 releases 3 moles of OH-.

When we add HCl, a strong acid, it's going to donate H+ ions. The H+ will react with OH- from Fe(OH)3 to form water. The neutralization reaction is 1:1 for H+ and OH-.

So, the moles of OH- from Fe(OH)3 is 3 * moles of Fe(OH)3. So, 3 * 0.000936 = 0.002808 mol of OH-.

But wait, the HCl is monobasic, so each mole provides one mole of H+. So the moles of H+ needed would be equal to the moles of OH- present. So, moles of HCl needed = 0.002808 mol.

But wait, let me think again. Fe(OH)3 is a weak base, so in solution, it may not completely dissociate. But in this case, since we're using a strong acid, the reaction will go to completion, right? Because the acid is strong, so it will provide enough H+ to neutralize all the OH- from Fe(OH)3.

Wait, but wait. Let me get this straight. Fe(OH)3 is a base, so when you add HCl, the H+ will react with OH- to form water. So for each mole of Fe(OH)3, you need 3 moles of HCl because each Fe(OH)3 gives 3 OH-.

Wait, no. Wait, no. Because each mole of Fe(OH)3 gives 3 moles of OH-, each
