Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Hmm, let me read it carefully. It's about space travel and time dilation, right? So the setup is that there's an intelligent civilization in the Large Magellanic Cloud. They've built a super fast spacecraft that can travel at 0.99999987 times the speed of light, which is almost the speed of light. The average lifetime of these aliens is about 150 years. Now, an astronaut who's 22 years old is going to Earth. The question is, how long will the trip take from the astronaut's perspective?

Wait, the options are A to D. A says the astronaut will die before reaching Earth. The others are in years.

So, I remember that when you're moving at speeds close to the speed of light, time dilation occurs. Time slows down for the traveler relative to a stationary observer. But wait, the question is asking from the astronaut's perspective. So I have to calculate the proper time, which is the time experienced by the traveler.

Right, the proper time τ (tau) is given by the time dilation formula. The formula is τ = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²), where t is the time measured by the stationary observer, and v is the speed of the spacecraft.

Wait, but wait a second. Wait, no, maybe I got that backwards. Let me think. The proper time is the shortest time between two events in the same frame. So from Earth's frame, the spacecraft is moving at speed v, so the time experienced on Earth would be longer. The astronaut's clock runs slower, so their experienced time is less.

But wait, no. Wait, the astronaut is in the spaceship, which is their frame. So from their perspective, Earth is moving towards them at speed v. So the distance they need to cover is contracted.

So the proper length is the distance measured in the rest frame (Earth's frame). But the astronaut's frame is moving, so they would see the distance as contracted. So the contracted length L is L0 * sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Where L0 is the proper length, Earth's frame.

So the time experienced by the astronaut (τ) would be the contracted distance divided by the speed. So τ = L / v = (L0 * sqrt(1 - v²/c²)) / v.

Alternatively, I can use the time dilation formula, but I need to get the right approach. Let me recall the formula.

The time dilation formula is t' = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²), where t' is the proper time (the astronaut's time) and t is the time measured by someone on Earth.

But wait, in the Earth frame, the distance is D, and the spacecraft's speed is v. So the time t in Earth frame is D / v.

So putting it all together, τ = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = (D / v) * sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

Alternatively, τ = D / (v / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)) ). Hmm, maybe not sure. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: from the astronaut's perspective, Earth is approaching at speed v, and the distance is contracted. So the time is (contracted distance) / v.

Contracted distance L = L0 * sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So τ = L / v = (L0 * sqrt(1 - v²/c²)) / v.

But L0 is the distance between Earth and the Large Magellanic Cloud in Earth's frame. Wait, wait, but the problem doesn't give us the distance. Hmm, that's a problem. So without knowing the actual distance, how can I compute the time?

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Wait, perhaps the question is assuming that the distance is such that the time from Earth's frame is 150 years? Or perhaps the time is given by another approach.

Wait no, the question states that the astronaut is 22 years old. The average lifetime is 150, so maybe the trip time from Earth's perspective is about 150 years, but I don't think that's the case.

Wait
