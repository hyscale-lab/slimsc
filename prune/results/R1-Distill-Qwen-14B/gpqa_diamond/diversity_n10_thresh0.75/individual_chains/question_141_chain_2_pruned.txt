Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me read it again. The question is about treating 1-bromobenzene-2-d with NaNH2 in condensed ammonia solvent. Hmm, wait, I'm a bit confused about the structure. Oh wait, 1-bromobenzene-2-dâ€”maybe that's a typo, or perhaps it's 1-bromo-2-dimethylaminobenzene? Or maybe it's 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene? No, wait, the 2-d might refer to a substituent. Wait, I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's 1-bromo-2-dimethylaminobenzene. Because sometimes in such questions, the substituents are indicated as something like 2-d, which could stand for a dimethylamino group. But I'm not entirely certain. Let me think about the reaction first.

The reagent is sodium amide (NaNH2) in condensed ammonia solvent. I remember that NaNH2 is a strong base, often used for deprotonation reactions, especially in aromatic substitution. Also, in such conditions, it's typical for elimination or aromatic substitution via the formation of a benzene ring with a strong electron-withdrawing group.

Wait, so if the starting material is 1-bromobenzene-2-d, perhaps the substituents are a bromine at position 1 and a dimethylamino group at position 2. Because 2-d could stand for 2-(dimethylamino). So the structure would be para-bromine and ortho-dimethylamino
