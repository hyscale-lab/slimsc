Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it carefully.

The question is about identifying an unknown compound using FTIR and 1H NMR data. The options are four different structures, and I need to pick the correct one based on the given spectroscopic information.

First, let's look at the FTIR part. The spectrum shows a very broad absorption around 3000 cm^-1. I remember that broad peaks in IR typically correspond to O-H stretching, especially in carboxylic acids. The broadness is because the O-H bonds are hydrogen-bonded, which broadens the peak. So that suggests the compound has a carboxylic acid group, -COOH. So all the options have that since the formula ends with COOH.

Next, the IR also shows a strong absorption at 1700 cm^-1. That's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Carboxylic acids typically have their carbonyl around 1700 cm^-1, so that fits with what we thought earlier. So no issue there.

Now, looking at the 1H NMR data. The problem states that several peaks were observed, none of which correspond to vinyl hydrogens. So the compound doesn't have any double bonds or aromatic rings with H's, which makes sense because all the options are more like branched alkanes with a carboxylic acid group, no vinyl groups.

In the NMR, two specific signals are described. The first is a doublet of triplets of quartets, and the second is a doublet of triplets of triplets. Hmm, that's a bit complicated splitting. Let's think about what that implies.

In NMR splitting, each split comes from coupling with neighboring protons. So if a proton is next to two different sets of protons, each with different coupling constants, the splitting can become complex.

Let's consider the structure of each option. All of them have a structure where the COOH group is attached to a chain with branching. Let me sketch them out:

Option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH. So the structure is like (CH3)(C2H5)C-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2COOH. Wait, maybe I should write it more clearly. It's probably a geminal di-substituted structure. Let me think: the molecule is CH2(C)(C)CH2COOH, where each C has a CH3 and a C2H5 group.

Wait, maybe it's better to draw each structure.

Option A: The structure is CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2COOH. So, the part before the COOH is a chain where each CH is connected to a CH3 and a C2H5 group. So each CH has two substituents: one CH3 and one C2H5.

Option B: CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH. So the structure is CH2CH2-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-COOH. Wait, wait, CH3CH2 is a propyl group attached to a carbon which has another C2H5 group. Hmm, maybe I should read it as the structure is CH2CH2 (from CH3CH2-) connected to a central carbon which has another substituent, but I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to think about the groups attached to each carbon in the chain. Let's consider each option's structure:

Option D: CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH. That's a chain where the first carbon is CH3, then CH2, then a CH which is attached to another CH3, followed by another CH attached to CH3, then COOH. So the structure is like CH3-CH
