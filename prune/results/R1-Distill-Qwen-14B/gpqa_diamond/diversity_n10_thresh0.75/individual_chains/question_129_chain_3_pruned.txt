Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let me read through the question and the hints carefully.

The question is about identifying compound E based on a series of reactions. Let me break down each step.

First, the reaction steps:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to form B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 and Pd to form C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 (nitrous acid) to form D.
4. D eliminates an inert gas to form E.

The hints are:

a) Compound A, when reacted with an unknown phosphorous ylide, forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane.

b) IR of A has a strong peak around 1750 cm^-1; E's IR is around 1715 cm^-1.

The options are A to D, each a cyclic ketone.

Hmm. Let's think about each step.

Step 1: A + HCN â†’ B. HCN usually adds to carbonyl groups in ketones or aldehydes. So A is likely a ketone because the product B would then be a cyanohydrin. Wait, but when a ketone reacts with HCN, it forms a cyanohydrin (a geminal diol with a cyanide group attached). But wait, more accurately, it's a 1,2-addition. So A is probably a cyclic ketone.

Step 2: B is reduced with H2 and Pd. That's hydrogenation. Pd usually reduces triple bonds, maybe double bonds. But since B is from A + HCN, which is a 1,2-addition, B would have a CH2CN group attached. Wait, no: HCN adds to the carbonyl, so for a ketone R2CO, adding HCN would give R2C(OH)CN.

Wait, but in the presence of HCN and a ketone, the product is a cyanohydrin. So for example, cyclohexanone would react to form a cyanohydrin, giving a bicyclic structure? Or perhaps it's a secondary alcohol with a cyanide group adjacent.

Then, when B is hydrogenated with H2 and Pd, perhaps any double bonds are reduced. Alternatively, it might hydrogenate the nitrile
