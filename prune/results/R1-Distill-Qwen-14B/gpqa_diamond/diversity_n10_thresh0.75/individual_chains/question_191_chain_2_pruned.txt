Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me take it slow because I'm still learning these mechanisms.

Alright, the starting material is 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. Hmm. Let me draw that structure mentally. So, it's a cyclohexanone ring. The 3 position has a hydroxymethyl group (CH2OH), and the 5 position has a prop-1-en-2-yl group. Prop-1-en-2-yl is like a CH2-C=CH2, right? Or wait, prop-1-en-2-yl would be CH2-C(CH2?), no. Wait, the formula for prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2CH2CH2 but with a double bond. Wait, no. Let me think. Propene has three carbons, with double bond between C1 and C2. So prop-1-en-2-yl would be CH2=CH-CH2? No, wait, the substituent is prop-1-en-2-yl. So the structure is CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? No, wait. Wait, the substituent is prop-1-en-2-yl, which is CH2CH=CH2 attached via the second carbon. Oh, wait, prop-1-en-2-yl is actually CH2-C(CH2)=CH2? No, maybe it's CH2=CHCH2- but attached at the middle carbon. Wait, maybe it's the group where the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the substituent is attached at C2. So it's CH2=CH-CH2- but attached at the middle carbon. Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think: prop-1-en-2-yl would be the group -CH2-C(=CH2)-. Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, maybe it's -C(CH2CH2)=CH2? No, perhaps it's -CH2CH2CH2 with a double bond between C1 and C2. So, it's CH2=CHCH2- attached via the C2? So, the substituent is CH2-CH2-CH2 but with
