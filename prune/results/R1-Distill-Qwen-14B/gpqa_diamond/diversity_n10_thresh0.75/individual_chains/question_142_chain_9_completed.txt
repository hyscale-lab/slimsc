Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. The question is about the density matrix of a qubit and its geometrical position in qubit space. Hmm, I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's mixed or entangled. 

The given density matrix is ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). Wait, let me write that down. So each term is a projector, and they're added together and multiplied by 1/2. I think this might represent a classical mixture of the states |0⟩ and |1⟩. Because if it were a pure state, the density matrix would be |ψ⟩⟨ψ| for some ψ. But since this is a sum of projectors, it's probably a mixed state.

So, to find its geometrical position, I guess I need to represent this density matrix in the Bloch sphere representation. Oh right, the Bloch sphere is a way to visualize qubit states. Pure states are on the surface, and mixed states are inside. But how does the density matrix translate to the Bloch sphere coordinates?

I remember that any single-qubit density matrix can be written as a vector on the Bloch sphere. The general form is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices, and r is a vector (the Bloch vector) with components (x,y,z) such that |r| ≤1. So if I can express ρ in this form, I can find r.

Let me expand the given ρ. The identity matrix I for a qubit is 2x2, so (I)/2 is (1/2) times the identity matrix. The other terms are |0⟩⟨0| and |1⟩⟨1|. Let me write each of these as matrices. 

|0⟩⟨0| is a diagonal matrix with 1 and 0 on the diagonal. Similarly, |1⟩⟨1| is diagonal with 0 and 1. So adding them together, |0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1| gives the identity matrix I. So ρ is (I)/2 + (I)/2? Wait wait, no. Wait, (1/2)(I) would be (1/2) for each diagonal element. So the given ρ is actually ρ=(I)/2.

Wait, because |0⟩⟨0| is [[1,0],[0,0]], |1⟩⟨1| is [[0,0],[0,1]], so adding them gives [[1,0],[0,1]], which is the identity matrix I. So (1/2)(I + I) would be (I)/2? Wait no, no: (1/2)(I + something else). Wait no, the given is (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|) = (1/2)I, right? Because |0><0| + |1><1| equals I. So ρ = (1/2)I.

Wait, that's interesting. So ρ is (1/2) times the identity matrix. So the identity matrix in 2x2 is [[1,0],[0,1]]. So (1/2)I is [[0.5, 0],[0, 0.5]]. 

But how does this relate to the Bloch sphere? Because the general form is ρ = (I + r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z ) / 2. So let's write our ρ in terms of identity and Pauli matrices.

Our ρ is (1/2)(I). So that would mean that the coefficients for σ_x, σ_y, and σ_z are all zero. Because when we expand (I + 0*σ_x + 0*σ_y + 0*σ_z ) / 2, we get (I)/2, which matches ρ. Therefore, the vector r is (0,0,0). 

Wait, but wait another thing. The Bloch vector r is (x, y, z), where each component corresponds to the expectation values in those directions. Alternatively, I think the density matrix can be written as (I + r·σ)/2, so when ρ is (I)/2, all the r components must be zero. So the vector is at the origin. That would mean the qubit is in the completely mixed state, which makes sense because each basis state is equally probable, and there's no coherence. So it's like a classical mixture, not a quantum state with any phase information.

Looking at the options, option C is r=(0,0,0). Option B is (0,0,1), which would be along the z-axis. So if r were (0,0,1), that would correspond to a density matrix with (I + σ_z)/2, which is a pure state |0⟩⟨0| or |1⟩⟨1|, but in our case, it's (I)/2, which is the maximally mixed state. So the answer must be option C.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes I get mixed up with the coordinate systems. Let me double-check. The Bloch sphere vector r has components x, y, z. The pure state |0⟩ would correspond to r=(0,0,1), while |1⟩ is (0,0,-1), maybe? Or is it (0,0,1) for |0⟩ and (0,0,-1) for |1⟩? Wait, the standard representation is |0⟩ corresponds to (0,0,1) and |1⟩ to (0,0,-1). So for the density matrix |0⟩⟨0|, the Bloch vector is (0,0,1). But our problem is that the density matrix is (I)/2, which is the completely mixed state. So all the components of r must be zero, placing it at the origin.

So the correct option is C) r=(0,0,0).


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This can be rewritten as 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} I,
\]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix. The identity matrix in 2x2 form is 

\[
I = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix},
\]

so 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 0.5 & 0 \\ 0 & 0.5 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

To interpret this density matrix in terms of the Bloch sphere, the general form of a single-qubit density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} \right),
\]

where \(\mathbf{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z)\) is the Bloch vector, and \(\boldsymbol{\sigma} = (\sigma_x, \sigma_y, \sigma_z)\) are the Pauli matrices. Comparing this with the given \(\rho = \frac{1}{2} I\), it is evident that the coefficients of \(\sigma_x\), \(\sigma_y\), and \(\sigma_z\) are all zero. This implies that the Bloch vector \(\mathbf{r}\) is 

\[
\mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0).
\]

This corresponds to the completely mixed state, which is located at the origin of the Bloch sphere. Among the options provided, the correct choice is 

\[
\text{C) } r = (0, 0, 0).
\]
