Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem to solve, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about the density matrix of a qubit and finding its geometrical position in qubit space. Hmm, I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's mixed (not pure). 

The given density matrix is ρ = 1/2 (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). Let me write that down. So, each of the terms |0⟩⟨0| and |1⟩⟨1| are projectors, right? When you add them together and multiply by 1/2, it averages them.

Wait, I think a general qubit density matrix is a 2x2 matrix. The density matrix for a pure state |ψ⟩ is |ψ⟩⟨ψ|, but when it's a mixed state, it's a statistical mixture. So here, ρ is a mixture of |0⟩ and |1⟩, each with equal probability. That must mean it's a completely mixed state. 

I remember that for a qubit, the state can be represented as a point on the Bloch sphere. The Bloch vector (r) has components (x, y, z), and the density matrix can be written in terms of these components. The general form is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices. 

So let me expand that. The Pauli matrices are σ_x, σ_y, σ_z. The formula becomes ρ = [ I + (x σ_x + y σ_y + z σ_z) ] / 2. Since our given ρ is (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)/2, let's compute it.

Wait, |0⟩⟨0| is [[1,0],[0,0]], and |1⟩⟨1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. Adding them gives [[1,0],[0,1]], which is the identity matrix I. So ρ = (I + ... )/2. Wait, no, wait, our given ρ is (I)/2 because |0><0| + |1><1| is I. So ρ is I/2.

So plugging into the Bloch sphere formula: I/2 = (I + r·σ) / 2. Let me solve for r·σ. Multiply both sides by 2: I = I + r·σ. Subtract I: 0 = r·σ. That implies r·σ is zero. So the vector r must be (0,0,0).

Looking at the options, option C is (0,0,0). So the geometrical position is at the origin in the Bloch sphere. That makes sense because the completely mixed state is the maximally uncertain state, which is the center of the Bloch sphere.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents a mixed state where the qubit is in a statistical mixture of the states \(|0\rangle\) and \(|1\rangle\), each with equal probability. To determine its geometrical position in the qubit space, we use the Bloch sphere representation. For a general qubit, the density matrix can be written as 

\[
\rho = \frac{I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}}{2},
\]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix, \(\boldsymbol{\sigma} = (\sigma_x, \sigma_y, \sigma_z)\) are the Pauli matrices, and \(\mathbf{r} = (x, y, z)\) is the Bloch vector. Expanding this, the components of \(\mathbf{r}\) correspond to the expectation values of the Pauli matrices.

For the given \(\rho\), we note that \(|0\rangle\langle 0| + |1\rangle\langle 1| = I\), so \(\rho = \frac{I}{2}\). Comparing this to the general form, we see that \(\mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} = 0\), which implies \(\mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0)\). This corresponds to the origin of the Bloch sphere, representing the completely mixed state.

Thus, the geometrical position of the density matrix in qubit space is at the origin.
