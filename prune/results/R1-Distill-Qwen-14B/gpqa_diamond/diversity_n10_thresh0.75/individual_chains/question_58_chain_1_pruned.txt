Okay, so I've got this physics question here, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let's see what it's about. The question is asking which physical theory never requires regularization at high energies. The options are A) Superstring Theory, B) Quantum Chromodynamics, C) Quantum Electrodynamics, D) Classical Electrodynamics.

Hmm, I remember that regularization is a technique used in quantum field theories to deal with divergences, like infinities that pop up in calculations. These infinities are a problem because they don't give physical results. So regularization helps make these infinities manageable by introducing a cutoff or some other method, allowing the calculations to be finite and then renormalizing to get rid of the cutoff dependence.

Wait, but the question is which theory doesn't require regularization. So maybe some theories are finite, meaning they don't have these kinds of divergences, right? Because if a theory is finite, you don't need to regularize or renormalize it.

Let me think about each option one by one.

Option A: Superstring Theory. I think string theory is a candidate for a theory of quantum gravity. It's a quantum theory, so it probably deals with high energies, like the Planck scale. But wait, string theory is supposed to be a background-independent theory and might have better behavior at high energies. Or does it? I'm a bit fuzzy here. But wait, string theories do have their own renormalization issues, but I'm not sure if they require regularization in the same way as other QFTs. Or maybe because they have a higher-dimensional structure, they don't need the same kind of divergent regularization as others. Hmm, not sure yet.

Option B: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). QCD is the theory of the strong interaction. I know that QCD is a non-abelian gauge theory, similar to SU(3). But wait, QCD has asymptotic freedom, meaning that at high energies (or short distances), the coupling becomes weak. But does that mean it requires regularization? Well, I think QCD does require regularization because it's a quantum field theory with divergent loop integrals. For example, calculations in QCD often use techniques like lattice regularization or other methods. So B probably does require regularization.

Option C: Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). QED is the theory of electromagnetism, one of the first quantum field theories. I remember that QED is a renormalizable theory, but it does require renormalization because of divergences. So you need to regularize it, maybe using methods like cutoff regularization, dimensional regularization, etc. So QED definitely requires regularization, meaning option C is not the answer.

Option D: Classical Electrodynamics. Wait, that's the non-quantum version. Classical theories don't involve the same divergences because they don't have the same mathematical structure as quantum field theories. For example, in classical E&M, you don't have issues like electron self-energy or vacuum polarization because those are quantum effects. So when you calculate things in classical E&M, like the force between charges, you don't get infinities. So in that case, you don't need regularization because there are no divergent loop integrals. So if the question is about a theory that never requires regularization at high energies, classical ED might be the one.

Wait, but the options are about when they are used at high energies. So when you go to high energies, does classical ED break down? Because at high energies (or equivalently, small distances), quantum effects become important, so you need to go to QED. But the question is about which theory, when applied, doesn't require regularization. So if you're using classical ED, you don't need regularization because it's not a quantum theory. So when you plug in high energies into classical ED, you might run into issues like the breakdown of the theory, but that's separate from regularization. Because regularization is a quantum field theory tool.

So putting it all together, the theory that never requires regularization is the one that doesn't have these divergences in the first place. So classical electrodynamics is a theory where you don't have these problems because you're not doing quantum calculations
