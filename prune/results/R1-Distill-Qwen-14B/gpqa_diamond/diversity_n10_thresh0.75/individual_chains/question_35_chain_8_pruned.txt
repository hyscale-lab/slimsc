Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem about angular momentum operators. Hmm, let me try to figure it out. The question is about finding the correct statement related to the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the Ay operator.

Alright, so the problem states that Ay is a 2x2 matrix operator, which is given as c multiplied by S. The constant c is h/(4π), and S is another 2x2 matrix. The first row of S is [0, -i], and the second row is [i, 0]. So, I should probably write down the matrix for Ay first.

Let me compute that. So, c is h/(4π), right? So Ay = c * S. Let me write S as a matrix:

S = [[0, -i],
     [i, 0]]

So when I multiply each element by c, Ay becomes:

Ay = [[0 * c, (-i)*c],
      [i * c, 0 * c]]

Which is:

Ay = [[0, -i*(h/(4π))],
      [i*(h/(4π)), 0]]

Hmm, okay. Now, the problem says that Ay has eigenvalues a, and we need to find them and the eigenvectors. So I should set up the characteristic equation.

The eigenvalues a satisfy det(Ay - a I) = 0. Let's compute the determinant of Ay - a I.

Ay - a I = [[-a, (-i h)/(4π)],
            [(i h)/(4π), -a]]

The determinant is (-a)(-a) - [(-i h/(4π))(i h/(4π))]

Calculating each part:

First term: a^2.

Second term: (-i h/(4π)) * (i h/(4π)) = (-i * i) * (h^2)/(16 π²). Since i^2 is -1, so (-i) * i = -i² = 1. So the second term is (h²/(16 π²)) * 1 = h²/(16 π²).

So the determinant equation is a^2 - (h²/(16 π²)) = 0. So a^2 = h²/(16 π²), which leads to a = ± h/(4 π) * 1/2? Wait, wait, let me compute it correctly.

Wait, sqrt(h²/(16 π²)) is h/(4 π). Because sqrt( (h/(4π))² ) is h/(4π). So a^2 = (h/(4π))^2, so a = ± h/(4π). Wait, wait no—Wait, the determinant equation is a² - (h²/(16 π²)) = 0, so a² = h²/(16 π²). So a = ± h/(4π) * (1/2). Wait, no: sqrt(h²/(16 π²)) is h/(4π) * [1/2]? Because 16 is 4 squared, so sqrt(16) is 4, making it (h/(4π))^2. Wait, no, wait: 16 π² is (4π)^2, so h/(4π) squared is (h²)/(16 π²). So sqrt of that is h/(4π). Oh, right, so a is ± h/(4π).

Wait no, wait, the equation a² = (h/(4π))², so a = ± h/(4π). Oh, that's right. So the eigenvalues are a = h/(4π) and a = -h/(4π).

Wait, but the options don't seem to directly talk about the eigenvalues as h/(4π) and negative that. Let me check the options again.

Option A says the imaginary part of the eigenvalue are ±2πh, and real parts are ±h/(4π). Wait, but our eigenvalues are real numbers, right? Because the matrix Ay is Hermitian. Because S is a Pauli matrix, which is Hermitian
