Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a matrix operator Ay. The operator is given as Ay = c·S, where c is h/(4π) and S is a 2x2 matrix. The first row of S is [0, -i], and the second row is [i, 0]. So, S looks like this:

S = [[0, -i],
     [i, 0]]

Hmm, wait a second, I remember that the Pauli matrices are similar. Oh right! This S matrix is actually the Pauli Y matrix, σy. Because the Pauli matrices are:

σx = [[0,1],[1,0]]
σy = [[0,-i],[i,0]]
σz = [[1,0],[0,-1]]

So S here is σy. And since Ay is c times S, that makes Ay = (h/(4π)) * σy.

I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. Let me recall how to find eigenvalues of a matrix. For any 2x2 matrix, the eigenvalues λ satisfy the characteristic equation det(Ay - λI) = 0.

So let's compute Ay first. Wait, c is h/(4π), so let's write Ay explicitly.

Ay = (h/(4π)) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]

Which is:

[[0, -(i h)/(4π)],
 [i h/(4π), 0]]

Wait, let's compute that:

Each element of S is multiplied by c. So first row first column is 0 * c = 0. First row second column is (-i)*c = (-i h)/(4π). Second row first column is i * c = (i h)/(4π), and second row second column is 0.

So the matrix Ay is:

[ [0, -(i h)/(4π) ],
  [ (i h)/(4π), 0 ] ]

Now, to find the eigenvalues, I'll set up the characteristic equation.

The matrix (Ay - λ I) is:

[[-λ, -(i h)/(4π)],
[ (i h)/(4π), -λ ] ]

The determinant of this is (-λ)*(-λ) - [ (i h)/(4π) ) * ( - (i h)/(4π) ) ] 

So determinant is λ² - [ (i h/(4π)) * (-i h/(4π)) ) ]

Wait, let me compute the product of the off-diagonal terms. The (1,2) term is -(i h)/(4π), and the (2,1) term is (i h)/(4π). So their product is [ (i h/(4π)) * ( - i h/(4π) ) ].

Wait, no, the product is (element from row 1, column 2) multiplied by (element from row 2, column 1), but with a negative sign because it's (a*d - b*c). So actually, the determinant is:

( (-λ)(-λ) ) - ( ( -(i
