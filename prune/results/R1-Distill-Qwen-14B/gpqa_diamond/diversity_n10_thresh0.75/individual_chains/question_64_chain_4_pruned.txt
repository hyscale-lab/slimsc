Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me try to understand what's going on.

The problem says that we have an equimolar mixture of salts A and B. Their total weight is 7.20 grams. They're heated to 200°C without air. When heated, they produce a mixture of gases. These gases are passed through three different tubes: the first is filled with anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2, the second with Ca(OH)2 solution, and the third with red-hot copper. 

The results are: tube 1 gains 3.60g, tube 3 gains 0.80g, and tube 2's weight doesn't change. Finally, 2.24 liters of gas C are left at standard temperature and pressure (STP). I need to find the total number of all atoms in salts A and B.

Hmm. Let me break this down.

First, the setup: heating salts A and B to 200°C without air. So, likely a decomposition reaction. The gases produced will pass through these tubes, which probably trap certain gases.

Tube 1 has Mg(ClO4)2, which is a drying agent, but in anhydrous form. Wait, but wait, Mg(ClO4)2 is a strong dehydrating agent and can react with water. So, if the gas has water vapor, Mg(ClO4)2 would trap it. So the weight increase in tube 1 is due to water.

So, the weight increase is 3.60g. The formula for water is H2O, which has a molar mass of 18 g/mol. So, moles of H2O would be 3.60g / 18g/mol = 0.2 mol.

So, the first reaction is that A and B produce H2O. So, that's 0.2 moles of H2O.

Next, tube 2 is Ca(OH)2 solution. But the weight didn't change, meaning that no gas reacted with it. What gases would react with Ca(OH)2 solution? Well, CO2 is a possibility. Ca(OH)2 reacts with CO2 to form CaCO3 and water. If the gas mixture had CO2, it would be absorbed here. But since the weight didn't change, perhaps there's no CO2, or maybe it's not in a form that reacts here. Alternatively, maybe the CO2 is already captured by the first tube, but that's unlikely because Mg(ClO4)2 is a drying agent, not a CO2 absorber. Hmm, maybe the CO2 passed through because Mg(ClO4)2 can't absorb it. So if tube 2 didn't gain weight, there's no CO2 in the gas mixture. Or perhaps the CO2 is present but didn't react? That doesn't make much sense. Alternatively, maybe the solution in tube 2 is saturated, or some other reason, but I'm not sure. I'll keep this in mind.

Then, tube 3 is red-hot copper. The weight increase is 0.80g. What reactions occur with red-hot copper? Well, when gases pass through hot copper, gases like CO2 or H2 can react. For example, H2 might react to form water, but in this case, the product after copper is CuO, as stated. So, if the gas has H2, it would react with CuO or Cu? Wait, no, maybe the other way around. Let me think. Red-hot copper in contact with gases. Let's think about possible reactions.

If the gas has H2S, but that's probably not the case here. Alternatively, if there's H2, it could react with CuO. Wait, but Cu is red-hot. So if H2 is present, it would reduce CuO, but wait, in this case, the copper is in the presence of H2. So, perhaps the reaction is 2Cu + H2 → 2Cu + H2O. No,
