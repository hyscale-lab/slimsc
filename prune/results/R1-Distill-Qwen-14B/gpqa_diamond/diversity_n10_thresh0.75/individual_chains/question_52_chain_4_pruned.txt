Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down. Hmm, the question is about stars with spots affecting the ratio of neutral Titanium atoms in two energy levels. 

So, the details: the star has 1.5 solar radius and 1.1 solar masses. When it's not covered by spots, its Teff is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Wait, but how does that work? Oh right, when spots (which are cooler) cover part of the star's surface, the average temperature of the photosphere goes down.

The question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2). Normally, without spots, this ratio is some value. When spots are present, this ratio decreases. The task is to find by what factor the ratio changes when the star is spotless compared to when it has spots.

The transition between these levels is at about 1448 Å. And we can assume the photosphere is in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), so Boltzmann equation applies for the level populations.

Wait, the ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann factor: (n2)/(n1) = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k*T) ). So, if E is the energy difference between the levels, the ratio depends exponentially on temperature.

But wait, in this case, the star's effective temperature changes when spots are present. The spots are cooler, so parts of the photosphere are at a lower temperature. Hmm, but the problem says the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500 K. So I think we can model the entire photosphere as being at 5500 K when spots are present, as opposed to 6000 K when not.

Wait, no, no. Wait, the problem says when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff is 5500 K. So the average temperature of the whole photosphere is lower. But the spots themselves are cooler than the rest. But for the purpose of the question, which is about the photospheric ratio, perhaps we can model the entire photosphere as being at 5500 K when spots are present. Because the spots would contribute to the overall flux, so the effective temperature is an average.

So the question is, when the star is spotless, T1=6000 K, and when it has spots, T2=5500 K.

The ratio is (n2/n1) = (g2/g1) * exp(-ΔE/(k*T)), where ΔE is E2 - E1. But wait, if level 2 is higher in energy than level 1, then ΔE is positive. So as temperature decreases, the ratio (n2/n1) would decrease because the exponential term becomes smaller. That aligns with the problem statement: when the star has spots (Teff decreases), the ratio decreases.

So, the original ratio is (n2/n1)_1
