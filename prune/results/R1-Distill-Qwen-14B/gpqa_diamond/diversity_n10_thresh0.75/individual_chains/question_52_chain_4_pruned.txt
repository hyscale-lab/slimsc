Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read through it carefully.

The question is about a star with some specific characteristics. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. Without any dark spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. 

So, the main question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2) in the stellar photosphere. They observe that when the star has spots, this ratio decreases. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does.

Hmm. Oh wait, the transition between these levels is at approximately 1448 Å. And we're told the photosphere is in LTE, which means Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium holds, so the usual Boltzmann equation applies for the level populations.

Right, so the ratio of atoms in two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann equation. The formula is (n2/n1) = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2-E1)/(k*T) ), where g's are the statistical weights, E's are the energies, and k is Boltzmann's constant, T is temperature.

In this problem, when the star has spots, the overall effective temperature is lower (5500 K), so the ratio of level 2 to level 1 (n2/n1) should be lower because the exponential term decreases as T decreases. But wait, the problem says that the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So without spots, n2/n1 is higher than when there are spots. So the factor is (ratio without spots)/(ratio with spots).

Wait, the question is asking for the factor by which the ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it has spots. So that's (n2/n1)_no_spots divided by (n2/n1)_with_spots.

But wait, what's the transition? The transition between levels corresponds to a specific wavelength. The energy difference is connected to the wavelength via the relation E = hc/λ, where h is Planck
