Okay, so I've got this question about which stars can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my astronomy, but let me think this through.

The question gives me five stars, each with different properties. I need to figure out for each star whether it's bright enough to be observed by both spectrographs. The key here is the apparent magnitude because that's what determines how bright a star appears from Earth, which in turn affects whether the instruments can detect it.

Wait, right. Both ESPRESSO and HIRES have different brightness limits. From the question, ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes up to 17 mag, while HIRES can go up to 16 mag. So any star that's brighter than 17 mag can be seen by ESPRESSO, and brighter than 16 can be seen by HIRES. But wait, no, the question says "brighter than 17 mag" for ESPRESSO. Oh wait, no, in astronomy, lower magnitudes mean brighter. So a star with V=16 is brighter than V=17. So the observable range for ESPRESSO is V ≤17, and for HIRES, V ≤16.

Wait, no, let me double-check. The question states: "with ESPRESSO, stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed." Oh, wait, "brighter than" in magnitude terms actually means lower numbers. So, V magnitude less than or equal to 17 for ESPRESSO. Because lower V means brighter. Wait, no, that's a point of confusion. Let me clarify: The V magnitude scale is such that lower numbers are brighter. So a star with V=5 is brighter than V=10. So "brighter than 17 mag" would mean V <=17. Because a star with V=16 is brighter than 17, so it is included. Oh wait, no, the wording is tricky. The question says, "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed." So that would be V < 17, right? Because "brighter than" implies a lower magnitude. So ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than 17, meaning V <17. HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16, so V <16.

Wait, that doesn't seem right because if the limit is 16, stars with V=16 or brighter (lower) would be observable. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me read the question again: "with ESPRESSO, stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed." So any star that has a V magnitude brighter (lower) than 17 can be observed. So that includes V=17, because 17 is not brighter than 17, but wait, it says "brighter than 17," so V must be less than 17. Similarly, for HIRES, stars with V brighter than 16 are observed, so V must be less than 16.

Wait, perhaps it's the other way. Maybe the limit is that they can observe up to a certain magnitude. So for example, ESPRESSO can observe
