Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let's see what it's about. The question is about finding probabilities and the average value of an operator. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, the state vector is given as |alpha> proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. Since |up> and |down> are orthonormal, I can probably normalize this state first. Because the problem says it's proportional, so I need to find the normalization factor.

Wait, normalization means the sum of the squares of the amplitudes (the absolute values) should equal 1. So the state is (1+i) for |up> and (2 - i) for |down>. Let me compute the squared magnitudes.

The coefficient for |up> is (1 + i). Its magnitude squared is (1^2 + 1^2) = 2. For |down>, the coefficient is (2 - i), so the magnitude squared is (2^2 + (-1)^2) = 4 + 1 =5. So the total squared magnitude is 2 +5 =7. So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7), right? So the state |alpha> is [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ] |up> + [ (2 - i)/sqrt(7) ] |down>.

Next part of the problem: the operator has matrix elements A_ij where A_ij is hbar/2 if i≠j and 0 otherwise. Wait, so what's the size of the matrix? Since we're dealing with spin-1/2 particles, the spin states are two-dimensional, so it's a 2x2 matrix.

Let me write out the matrix. The diagonal elements are zero. The off-diagonal elements are hbar/2. So the matrix A would look like:

[ 0      hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2  0     ]

Hmm, that's the operator's matrix. Now, the question is to find the probabilities of measuring each eigenstate of this operator, and the average value.

Wait, but the operator isn't diagonal in the standard basis. So its eigenstates would be different from |up> and |down>. Therefore, I need to find the eigenstates of this operator A to find the probability of measuring each eigenstate.

Alternatively, perhaps another approach is to diagonalize the operator A first. Since it's a 2x2 matrix, this should be manageable.

The matrix A is:

[ 0      hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2  0     ]

To find the eigenvalues, I can compute the characteristic equation. The trace is zero, and the determinant is (0)(0) - (hbar/2)^2 = - (hbar^2)/4. So the eigenvalues λ satisfy λ^2 - (trace)λ + determinant =0. Since trace is zero, equation becomes λ^2 + ( - (hbar^2)/4 ) =0 → λ^2 = (hbar^2)/4 → λ = ± hbar/2.

Wait, no. Wait, the actual equation is λ^2 - (trace)λ + det(A) = 0. Trace is 0, so equation is λ^2 + (hbar^2/4) =0? Wait, wait, no. Let me compute the determinant again. The determinant of A is (0)(0) - (hbar/2)(hbar/2) = -(hbar^2)/4. So the equation is λ^2 - trace λ + det = λ^2 + ( - (hbar^2)/4 ) =0 → λ^2 = (hbar^2)/4 → λ=± (hbar/2). Oh wait, that's correct.

So the eigenvalues are λ_+ = hbar/2 and λ_- = -hbar/2.

Now, the eigenvectors. For λ = hbar/2:

(A - λ I) v =0. So:

[ -hbar/2   hbar/2 ] [v1]   [0]
[ hbar/2   -hbar/2 ] [v2] = [0]

So from the first equation: (-hbar/2) v1 + (hbar/2) v2 =0 → -v1 + v2=0 → v1 =v2. So the eigenvector is proportional to (1,1). Similarly, for λ = -hbar/2:

Matrix becomes:

[ hbar/2   hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2   hbar/2 ]

Which gives the equation (hbar/2)(v1 + v2)=0 → v1 = -v2. So the eigenvectors are (1,-1) and (1,1), normalized.

Wait, but wait, when λ is hbar/2, the first equation is (-hbar/2)v1 + (hbar/2)v2 =0 → v2 = v1. So the eigenvector is (1,1), and for λ = -hbar/2, the equation is (hbar/2)(v1 +v2)=0 → v1 = -v2; so the eigenvector is (1,-1).

Now, to normalize these. The normalized eigenvectors would be for λ = hbar/2: (1/sqrt(2))(1,1). And for λ = -hbar/2: (1/sqrt(2))(1,-1).

So the eigenstates are:

|+> = (|up> + |down> ) / sqrt(2)
|-> = (|up> - |down> ) / sqrt(2)

Wait wait, because in the standard basis, |up> is (1,0), |down> is (0,1). So the eigenvectors we found are in terms of |up> and |down>.

So now, the state |alpha> is expressed in the |up>, |down> basis. But we need to express it in terms of |+> and |-> to find the probabilities.

Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to write |alpha> as a linear combination of the eigenstates |+> and |->, and then the probability of measuring each eigenstate is the square of the coefficients.

So, let me compute the coefficients of |+> and |-> in |alpha>.

The state |alpha> is:

(1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) |down>

Expressed in terms of |+> and |->:

|alpha> = [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ] * 1/sqrt(2) |+>
          + [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) - (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ] * 1/sqrt(2) |->

Wait, because |+> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), so when you take the inner product with |alpha>, you get [ <up| + <down| ] / sqrt(2) multiplied by the coefficients.

Wait, perhaps a better way is to compute < + | alpha > and < - | alpha >.

Let me compute < + | alpha >.

< + | alpha > = (1/sqrt(2)) [ <up| + <down| ] * [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) |down> ]

= (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) <up|up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) <down|down> ]

Because <up|down> and <down|up> are zero.

So this becomes (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ) ]

Factor out 1/sqrt(7):

= (1/(sqrt(2) * sqrt(7))) ) [ (1+i) + (2 -i) ]

Compute (1+i) + (2 -i) = 3 + 0i = 3.

So < + | alpha > = 3/(sqrt(14)).

Similarly, compute < - | alpha >.

< - | alpha > = (1/sqrt(2)) [ <up| - <down| ] * [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) |down> ]

= (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) <up|up> - (2 -i)/sqrt(7) <down|down> ]

= (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) - (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ]

Factor out 1/sqrt(7):

= (1/(sqrt(2) * sqrt(7))) ) [ (1+i) - (2 -i) ]

Compute (1+i) - (2 -i) = (1-2) + (i +i) = (-1) + 2i.

So < - | alpha > = (-1 + 2i)/(sqrt(14)).

Now, the probabilities are the square of the absolute values of these coefficients.

For < + | alpha >: |3/(sqrt(14))|² = 9/14.

For < - | alpha >: | (-1 +2i )/(sqrt(14)) |².

Compute the numerator's magnitude squared: (-1)^2 + (2)^2 =1 +4=5. So (5)/(14).

Wait, wait, let's double-check that:

The coefficient for |-> is (-1 + 2i)/(sqrt(14)). The absolute value squared is ( (-1)^2 + (2)^2 )/(14) = (1+4)/14 =5/14.

So the probabilities are 9/14 (about 0.64) and 5/14 (about 0.36). So the probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36. Looking at the options, option A lists 0.64 and 0.36 as the first two numbers.

But wait, let me check the normalization: 9/14 +5/14 =14/14=1. So that checks out.

Now, the average value of the operator A. The average is < alpha | A | alpha >.

But since A is a Hermitian operator (as it's an observable), the expectation value can be computed as the sum over the eigenvalues multiplied by their probabilities.

Alternatively, since the operator A has eigenvalues ± hbar/2, each with probability 9/14 and 5/14 respectively.

So the expectation value is (9/14)(hbar/2) + (5/14)(-hbar/2) = [ (9 -5) hbar ]/(28) ) = (4 hbar)/(28) )= hbar/(7).

So the average is hbar/7.

Looking at the options, option A says 0.64, 0.36, and hbar/7. So option A.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating < + | alpha >.

Wait, the state |alpha> is (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>, all over sqrt(7).

So when I compute < + | alpha >, it's (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i) + (2 -i) ] / sqrt(7) = (3)/(sqrt(14)).

Yes, correct. So probability is 9/14 ≈0.6429, which is about 0.64 as in option A.

So the correct answer would be option A. But wait, looking at the options again:

Option A says probabilities 0.64 and 0.36, average hbar/7.

Yes, that's correct. So the answer is option A.


The problem involves calculating the probabilities of measuring the eigenstates of a given operator and finding the average value of that operator. The state of the system is given as proportional to \( | \alpha \rangle = (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \), where \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) are the eigenstates of the \( z \)-projection of the spin operator. The operator has a matrix representation \( A_{ij} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \) if \( i \neq j \), and \( A_{ij} = 0 \) otherwise.

### Step 1: Normalize the state
The coefficients of \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) are \( 1+i \) and \( 2-i \), respectively. The squared magnitudes are:
\[
|1+i|^2 = 2, \quad |2-i|^2 = 5.
\]
The total squared magnitude is \( 2 + 5 = 7 \), so the normalization factor is \( \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} \). The normalized state is:
\[
| \alpha \rangle = \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} |\uparrow\rangle + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} |\downarrow\rangle.
\]

### Step 2: Diagonalize the operator \( A \)
The operator \( A \) is represented as:
\[
A = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{\hbar}{2} \\
\frac{\hbar}{2} & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]
The eigenvalues of \( A \) are found by solving the characteristic equation \( \lambda^2 - \text{det}(A) = 0 \), where \( \text{det}(A) = -\left(\frac{\hbar}{2}\right)^2 = -\frac{\hbar^2}{4} \). The eigenvalues are:
\[
\lambda_+ = \frac{\hbar}{2}, \quad \lambda_- = -\frac{\hbar}{2}.
\]
The corresponding eigenvectors are:
\[
|+\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|\uparrow\rangle + |\downarrow\rangle), \quad |-\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|\uparrow\rangle - |\downarrow\rangle).
\]

### Step 3: Express \( | \alpha \rangle \) in terms of \( |+\rangle \) and \( |-\rangle \)
The coefficients of \( |+\rangle \) and \( |-\rangle \) in \( | \alpha \rangle \) are computed as:
\[
\langle + | \alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} \right) = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}},
\]
\[
\langle - | \alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} - \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} \right) = \frac{-1+2i}{\sqrt{14}}.
\]
The probabilities of measuring each eigenstate are the squared magnitudes of these coefficients:
\[
P(+\rangle) = \left| \langle + | \alpha \rangle \right|^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.64, \quad P(-\rangle) = \left| \langle - | \alpha \rangle \right|^2 = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.36.
\]

### Step 4: Compute the average value of \( A \)
The expectation value of \( A \) is:
\[
\langle A \rangle = \text{Tr}(A \rho) = \lambda_+ P(+\rangle) + \lambda_- P(-\rangle).
\]
Substituting \( \lambda_+ = \frac{\hbar}{2} \), \( \lambda_- = -\frac{\hbar}{2} \), \( P(+\rangle) = \frac{9}{14} \), and \( P(-\rangle) = \frac{5}{14} \):
\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \frac{9}{14} + \left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right) \cdot \frac{5}{14} = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

### Final Answer
The probabilities of measuring the eigenstates are \( 0.64 \) and \( 0.36 \), and the average value of the operator is \( \frac{\hbar}{7} \). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**Answer: A**
