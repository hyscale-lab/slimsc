Okay, so I've got this physics problem about the hydrogen atom and transitions between states. Hmm, let me try to think through this.

The question says that the |3,0,0⟩ state decays to |1,0,0⟩ via two dipole transitions. The options give different transition routes and probabilities. I'm a bit rusty on this, so I'll need to recall what I know about atomic transitions, selection rules, and dipole transitions.

First, in the hydrogen atom, the states are denoted by |n, l, m⟩, where n is the principal quantum number, l is the azimuthal (or angular momentum) quantum number, and m is the magnetic quantum number. Dipole transitions involve the emission or absorption of a photon, and they follow certain selection rules.

Wait, right! The selection rules for dipole transitions are:
- Δl = ±1 (the change in the azimuthal quantum number must be plus or minus one)
- Δm = 0, ±1 (the magnetic quantum number can change by 0 or ±1)

So initially, the state is |3,0,0⟩, which means n=3, l=0 (s orbital), and m=0. It's decaying to |1,0,0⟩, so n goes from 3 to 1, but wait, wait a second. Oh, because the transition is via two dipole transitions. So it's not a single transition but two steps.

So first, from |3,0,0⟩, it makes a dipole transition to some intermediate state, and then from there to |1,0,0⟩.

Let me break it down. The initial state is l=0 (s orbital). For a dipole transition, Δl must be ±1. So the first transition from l=0 can only go to l=1. Because from 0, it can't go to l=2 or anything else in a single step.

So the first transition must be from l=0 to l=1. So the intermediate state after the first transition must be |n1, 1, m1⟩.

Now, what about the m quantum number? From m=0, the next state's m can be m=0±0, ±1. So m can be -1, 0, or +1.

Wait, but for the first step, from |3,0,0⟩,
