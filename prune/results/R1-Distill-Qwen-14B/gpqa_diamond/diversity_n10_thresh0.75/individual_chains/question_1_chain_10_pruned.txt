Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about quantum states and their lifetimes. Hmm, I remember from my studies that the lifetime of a quantum state is related to how precisely we can measure its energy. Oh wait, right, it has to do with the uncertainty principle. Let me think.

The question says there are two states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds. We need to find the energy difference so that they can be clearly distinguished. The options are A to D.

Wait, the uncertainty principle states that the product of the energy uncertainty (ΔE) and the time (Δt) is on the order of ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. So the formula is ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2. 

So the idea is that for each state, the uncertainty in energy is inversely proportional to the lifetime. If the states have different lifetimes, their energy uncertainties are different. But since we're looking to distinguish between two states, the energy difference between them (ΔE) should be larger than the sum of their individual uncertainties. Or wait, perhaps the minimum uncertainty is determined by the shorter lifetime? I'm a bit confused here.

Alternatively, I think the energy resolution required is such that the energy difference is greater than the uncertainty of each state. Oh wait, no. Let me think again.

Each state has its own uncertainty. For state 1, ΔE1 ≈ ħ/(2 * τ1), and for state 2, ΔE2 ≈ ħ/(2 * τ2). Since τ1 is 1e-9 sec and τ2 is 1e-8 sec, τ1 is shorter. So ΔE1 is larger than ΔE2 because the denominator is smaller.

Wait, no, because if the lifetime is shorter, the uncertainty is higher. Because ΔE is
