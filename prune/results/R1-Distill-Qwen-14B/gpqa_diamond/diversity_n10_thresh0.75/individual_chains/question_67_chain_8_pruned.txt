Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The problem says we have two electrons in p orbital angular momentum states. We're ignoring their spin angular momentum, which probably means we're focusing only on their orbital angular momentum here. The coupled angular momentum state is given as |l1, l2, l, m> = |1,1,2,-1>. So, l1 and l2 are the orbital angular momentum quantum numbers for each electron, and l and m are the total angular momentum quantum numbers for the two-electron system.

The question is asking about the joint probability of measuring both L1z and L2z to have eigenvalues of -ħ. So, we're to find the probability that both electrons have their orbital angular momentum in the -ħ state when measured along the z-axis.

Hmm, okay. Let me think about what L1z and L2z represent. Each Lz is the z-component of the orbital angular momentum for each electron. For a single particle in an l=1 (p orbital) state, the possible m values are -1, 0, +1, and each corresponds to Lz = mħ. So, for each electron, Lz can be -ħ, 0, or +ħ.

Now, the state we're given is |1,1,2,-1>. Wait, wait—wait a second. Oh, because the two electrons each have l=1. When you couple two angular momenta l1 and l2, the possible total l values range from |l1 - l2| to l1 + l2 in integer steps. So here l1 =1, l2=1, so possible l values are 0,1,2. The given state has l=2 and m=-1.

So the state is a coupled state where the total angular momentum is 2, and the z-component is -1ħ. But we need to find the probability that each individual electron has Lz = -ħ.

Wait, but this is a coupled state, so it's a combination of the individual states. So maybe I need to express this coupled state |1,1,2,-1> in terms of the product states of each electron's individual states.

The product states would be |l1,
