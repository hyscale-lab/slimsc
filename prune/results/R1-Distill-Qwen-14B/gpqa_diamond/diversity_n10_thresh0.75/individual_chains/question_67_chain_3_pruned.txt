Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's start by reading the question carefully.

The question says we have two electrons in p orbitals, and we're told to ignore their spin angular momentum. The coupled angular momentum state is given as |l₁, l₂, l, m> = |1,1,2,-1>. So, for each electron, their orbital angular momentum quantum numbers are l₁=1 and l₂=1. The total angular momentum quantum numbers are l=2 and m=-1.

The question is asking about the joint probability of measuring both L₁z and L₂z to be -ħ each. So, we're measuring L₁z and L₂z, each of which are the z-components of the orbital angular momentum for each electron. The possible eigenvalues for L_z are m times ħ, where m is the magnetic quantum number (which is -l, ..., 0, ..., +l).

Wait, but in this problem, the state is a coupled state, right? So it's a product of individual states combined in a particular way. I think I need to express this coupled state in terms of the product states of each electron's individual states. Then, when we measure L₁z and L₂z, we can look at the coefficients of the product states to find the probabilities.

Hmm, so each electron has an l=1 orbital, so their possible m values are -1, 0, +1. But the total state is |1,1,2,-1>. Let me think about the addition of angular momenta here.

When combining two angular momenta, each with l=1, the possible total angular momentum quantum numbers (l) can be l=2, 1, 0. So in our case, the total l is 2, which is the maximum possible, so that's the state we're in.

Now, the state |1,1,2,-1> is an eigenstate of the total angular momentum squared (L²), the z-component of total angular momentum (L_z), and each individual L₁² and L₂². But for the individual L_z components (L₁z and L₂z), the state is a combination of the product states |m₁, m₂>.

Wait, so the coupled state is a superposition of different |m₁, m₂> states. Because the total m is m = m₁ + m₂. In our case, m is -1, so the possible |m₁, m₂> states that contribute must add up to -1.

Each term in the coupled state would be a product of the individual m states. So, how do we express |l₁, l₂, l, m> in terms of |m₁, m₂>?

I think for two p orbitals (l=1 each), the |l=2, m=-1> state is a combination of the product states where m₁ + m₂ = -1. The possible (m₁, m₂) pairs would be (-1,-0), (0,-1), (-0, -1)? Wait, no. Wait, m₁ can be -1, 0, +1, same for m₂. So the sum m = m
