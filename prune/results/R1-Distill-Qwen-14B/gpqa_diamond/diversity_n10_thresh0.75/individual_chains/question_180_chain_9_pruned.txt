Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem here. Let me read it again carefully. The question is about an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. Hmm, e is the elementary charge, right? So each has a charge of 2 times that, which is 2 times 1.602 x 10^-19 coulombs. That would be 3.204 x 10^-19 C each.

Wait, but the setup is a bit tricky. 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. So, point P has the 13th charge, and the other 12 are all at a distance of 2 meters from P. But since all the 12 are identical charges, they are probably arranged symmetrically around P. Maybe like a sphere or something. But for the purpose of calculating potential energy, maybe their exact arrangement doesn't matter beyond the distances.

The question asks for the minimum energy of the system. Oh, right, because in systems of charges, the potential energy is related to the work done to assemble them, and the minimum energy is the most stable state, perhaps when the charges are placed as close as possible without repelling each other. But wait, in this case, the 12 charges are constrained at 2 meters, so they can't get any closer. The 13th charge is fixed, so we can't move it.

Wait, but wait a second. The system is made up of 13 identical charges. Each has a charge of 2e. So, 2 times 1.602e-19 C is 3.204e-19 C each. So all particles are positive? Or could they be negative? Well, the problem says they're identical, so they must all have the same charge. Since 2e is the charge, they're all positive. So, all 13 are positive, each with 2e.

So the potential energy of the system will be the sum of the potential energies between each pair of charges. Because each charge contributes to the potential energy of the others.

Wait, but the 13th charge is fixed at point P, and the other 12 are at 2 m from P. So the 13th charge is at the center, and the others
