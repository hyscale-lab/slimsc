Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's take a deep breath and tackle it.

The question is about calculating the minimum energy of a system of charges. So, it's an electrostatics problem, probably involving Coulomb's Law. Hmm, the setup is an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. So, each has a charge of 2 times the elementary charge. The particles have negligible mass, which probably means we don't have to worry about kinetic energy or anything like that, just potential energy.

The setup is that 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. So, point P is where the 13th charge is, and the other 12 are each 2 meters away from P. 

Wait, so the system consists of a charge at P and 12 charges each at a distance of 2 meters from P. So, the 12 charges are all at the same distance from P, which is 2 meters. 

The question asks for the minimum energy of this system. Hmm, energy in a system of charges is the electrostatic potential energy. So, the system's total potential energy is the sum of the potential energies of each pair of charges.

Wait, but wait a second. Since the system is isolated, I think I need to consider all the interactions between the charges. Each pair contributes some potential energy, and the total is the sum of all those contributions.

So, the particles are all 2e charges. So, each has a charge of 2 times elementary charge, which is about 2 * 1.6e-19 coulombs, so approximately 3.2e-19 C.

Wait, but the 13th charge is fixed at P. So, the other 12 are each 2 meters away from P. Now, I'm trying to visualize where the 12 charges are located. Are they arranged in some specific way, like on a sphere? But the problem says they're each at 2 meters from P. So, perhaps each is at a distance of 2 meters from P, but their positions relative to each other aren't specified. Hmm, but for the potential energy, the distances between each pair matter.

Wait, but wait. If all 12 charges are fixed at 2 meters from P, but their positions relative to each other aren
