Okay, so I'm faced with this organic chemistry problem. Let me try to think through it step by step. The question is about identifying a compound based on its spectral data and then determining the product after a reaction. Hmm.

First, let's parse the question. The compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I remember that red phosphorus and HI are typically used in the hydrolysis of a nitrile group. Wait, no, wait. Actually, I think that's for converting nitriles to amines. Or maybe that's another reaction. Alternatively, I think HI with red phosphorus is used in the hydrolysis of esters or other groups. Or perhaps it's about deprotection. Oh wait, no, another thought: when a nitrile reacts with H2O in presence of red phosphorus and HI, it gets hydrolyzed to a carboxylic acid. Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is about elimination or addition. Wait, another angle: The reagents red phosphorus and HI are known for the hydrolysis of esters or maybe the formation of alkenes. Wait, no, another thought: Maybe it's a reduction. Or perhaps it's about the hydroboration? Hmm, I'm not exactly sure. Maybe I should focus on the structure of compound X first.

Looking at the spectral data for compound X. Let's start with the IR. The IR data shows strong absorption around 3400-2500 cm-1, which typically indicates O-H (like in alcohols or carboxylic acids) or N-H (amines) stretches. But wait, the presence of a peak around 3400 could also be from alkenes, but more likely O-H or N-H. But if there's a peak at 1720 cm-1, that's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So maybe it's an ester, ketone, aldehyde, or carboxylic acid. The 1610 and 1450 cm-1 regions are around the area for aromatic C=C stretching, so the compound likely has a benzene ring.

Now looking at the 1H NMR data. Let's list the peaks:

10.5 ppm (bs, 1H) - Broad singlet around 10.5 is probably an aldehyde proton, but wait, aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10 ppm, but that's a singlet. Alternatively, maybe it's a carboxylic acid proton, which is usually broad around 10-12 ppm. But if the IR shows 1720, which could be a ketone or ester. Wait, wait, in the case of a carboxylic acid, the O-H stretch is usually very strong and broad, which matches the 3400-2500 region. So the 10.5 ppm peak might be the O-H of a carboxylic acid. But wait, the IR also has a strong 1720, which would make sense for a carboxylic acid (around 1700 cm-1). Hmm, but wait, sometimes carboxylic acids have a higher wavenumber for the
