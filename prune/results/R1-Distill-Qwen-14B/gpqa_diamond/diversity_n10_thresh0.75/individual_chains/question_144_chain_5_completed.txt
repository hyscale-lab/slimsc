Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonances. I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but let me try to think this through.

The question is asking for the mean decay distance of a meson X. The given parameters are production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are A to D, which are various distances in orders of 10^-15 or 10^-16 meters.

Hmm, I remember that the mean lifetime of a particle is related to its width. The width Γ is the total decay width, which is connected to the particle's lifetime τ via the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. The formula I think is Γ ≈ ħ / τ, so τ ≈ ħ / Γ. But wait, I'm a bit confused about the exact relationship here. Oh right, because the uncertainty principle says that ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ, so the width Γ, which is like ΔE, multiplied by the lifetime τ gives approximately ħ. So τ ≈ ħ / Γ. That makes sense.

Once I have the lifetime, the mean decay distance would be the product of the particle's speed and its lifetime. So, L = v * τ. But how do I find the speed v?

Wait, the production energy E_X is given. Since the mass is 1.2 GeV, E_X is much larger. Wait, no, wait. Wait, production energy... Hmm, maybe E_X is the energy of the meson when it's produced. But for a relativistic particle, the energy E is related to mass and momentum. So E² = (pc)² + (m c²)². So I can find the momentum p, then find the velocity v from that.

Alternatively, since E is much larger than m, maybe we can approximate v as being close to the speed of light. But let's not get ahead of ourselves.

So let me outline the steps:

1. Calculate the lifetime τ using Γ.
2. Find the velocity v of the meson using its energy E_X and mass m_X.
3. Multiply v by τ to get the mean decay distance L.

Wait, but is that the correct approach? I think so. Alternatively, maybe I should compute the momentum from E and m, get the velocity, then compute L.

Let me break it down step by step.

First, calculate τ.

Γ is given as 320 MeV, which I should convert to GeV for consistency. 320 MeV is 0.32 GeV. So Γ = 0.32 GeV.

But wait, units are important. The Planck constant ħ is usually in units of GeV·s when working in these energy scales. So ħ ≈ 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. Wait, is that right? I think ħ is approximately 197.33 MeV·fm, but wait, converting units properly might be tricky.

Wait, let's get the exact value. I remember that ħc is about 197.33 MeV·fm. But for calculating τ, Γ is in GeV, so perhaps it's better to use ħ in GeV·s.

Yes, ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·seconds. So Γ is 0.32 GeV. So τ = ħ / Γ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) = approx 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Wait, 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32 is roughly 2.056e-24 s. Yeah, that seems right.

Next, find the velocity v.

E_X is 8 GeV, m_X is 1.2 GeV. So E² = (pc)^2 + (m c²)^2. Let's solve for p.

E = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m c²)^2 )

But wait, I can write in terms of energy and mass. Let me rearrange:

(pc)^2 = (E)^2 - (m c²)^2

But since E is in GeV, and m is in GeV/c²? Wait, no, units can get a bit tricky. Wait, E is in GeV, m is in GeV/c²? Or is it GeV?

Wait, no. Let me think in terms of natural units where c=1, but when calculating in SI units, I have to account for c.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the ratio of E to m to find beta (β = v/c).

Because E = gamma m c², and m c² is the rest energy. So gamma = E/(m c²). Wait, but since E is given in GeV and m in GeV/c², perhaps I can just compute beta as sqrt(1 - (m² c^4)/(E^2)).

Wait, let's see. Let me think in terms of units where c=1, but when plugging into equations, we have to handle units correctly.

Wait, perhaps beta can be found by:

beta = sqrt(1 - (m² c^4)/(E^2)).

But wait, E is the total energy, so E = gamma m c². So gamma = E/(m c²). Then, beta = sqrt(1 - 1/(gamma^2)).

So gamma = E/(m c²) = (8 GeV) / (1.2 GeV * c²) = 8/(1.2) * 1/(c²) * GeV/(GeV c²) ? Wait, maybe I'm getting stuck here. Let me think numerically.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute beta using the relativistic energy equation.

E² = (pc)^2 + (m c²)^2.

Divide both sides by c^4:

(E/(c²))² = (p c / c²)^2 + (m c² / c^2 )^2.

Which simplifies to:

(E/(c²))² = (p/(c))^2 + m².

But perhaps I can write it as:

p = sqrt( E² - (m c²)^2 ) / c.

But again, units are tricky. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute beta as v/c = sqrt(1 - (m² c^4)/(E²)).

Yes, that makes sense.

So beta = sqrt(1 - (m² c^4)/(E²)).

But I need to make sure the units are consistent. Let me compute m c² in GeV.

m_X is 1.2 GeV/c², so m c² is 1.2 GeV.

E is 8 GeV.

So, (m c²)^2 = (1.2 GeV)^2 = 1.44 (GeV)^2.

E^2 is (8 GeV)^2 = 64 (GeV)^2.

So (m c²)^2 / E^2 = 1.44 / 64 ≈ 0.0225.

Thus, beta = sqrt(1 - 0.0225) = sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887.

So v ≈ 0.9887 c.

Wait, that's a high beta. So velocity is about 0.9887 times the speed of light.

Now, calculate the mean decay distance L = v * tau.

Wait, but tau is in seconds. So v is in meters per second, tau in seconds. So L will be in meters.

v = beta c = 0.9887 * (3e8 m/s) ≈ 2.966e8 m/s.

Tau is 2.056875e-24 seconds.

So L = (2.966e8 m/s) * (2.056875e-24 s) = ?

Let me compute that.

First, 2.966e8 * 2.056875e-24 = 2.966 * 2.056875 * 1e-16.

Let me compute 2.966 * 2.056875.

Hmm, 2.966 * 2 = 5.932. 2.966 * 0.056875 ≈ 0.1693. So total about 6.1013.

So L ≈ 6.1013e-16 meters.

Wait, but looking at the options:

Option A: ~5e-16 m.

Option D: ~4e-16 m.

Hmm, my calculation gives around 6e-16, which isn't matching any option exactly. Did I do something wrong?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, wait, let's recalculate beta.

Wait, beta = sqrt(1 - m² c^4 / E² )

But wait, perhaps I forgot that m is in GeV/c² and E is in GeV. So when I compute m c², the units are GeV.

So, yes, (m c²) is 1.2 GeV, and E is 8 GeV. So the ratio is (1.2)^2 / (8)^2 = 1.44 / 64 = 0.0225.

So, 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. sqrt(0.9775) is about 0.9887, so that's correct.

Wait, but perhaps I should compute more accurately the square root. Let me compute sqrt(0.9775).

I know that 0.9887^2 is about 0.9775, but let me calculate it more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate beta with more precision.

Wait, 0.9775 is 0.9775.

Let me compute sqrt(0.9775). Let me think of it as (0.988)^2 is 0.976144, and 0.9887^2 is approximately 0.9775.

Yes, so beta ≈ 0.9887.

So v = 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s ≈ 2.966e8 m/s.

Tau is 2.056875e-24 s.

So L = 2.966e8 * 2.056875e-24 = ?

2.966e8 is 2.966 * 1e8.

2.056875e-24 is 2.056875 * 1e-24.

Multiply them: 2.966 * 2.056875 = ?

Let me compute 2.966 * 2 = 5.932.

2.966 * 0.056875 ≈ 0.1693.

Total is about 6.1013.

So 6.1013 * 1e8 * 1e-24 = 6.1013e-16 meters.

Wait, that's 6.1e-16 m. But the options don't have this. The options are 4.06e-15, 5.02e-15, etc.

Wait, did I make a mistake in the calculation of tau?

Wait, let me re-calculate tau.

Tau = ħ / Γ.

ħ is approximately 6.582e-25 GeV·s.

Γ is 320 MeV = 0.32 GeV.

So tau = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = ?

Compute 6.582e-25 / 0.32.

6.582 / 0.32 is approximately 20.56875.

So tau = 20.56875e-25 s = 2.056875e-24 s. That's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the decay width is given in MeV, but I converted it correctly to GeV?

Yes, 320 MeV is 0.32 GeV.

Hmm. Another thought: Maybe the width is given in MeV, but I should use ħ in units of MeV·s instead?

Wait, if Γ is 320 MeV, and ħ is 6.582e-25 GeV·s, but 1 GeV is 1000 MeV. So 6.582e-25 GeV·s = 6.582e-25 * 1000 MeV·s = 6.582e-22 MeV·s.

So tau = ħ / Γ = (6.582e-22 MeV·s) / (320 MeV) = 6.582e-22 / 320 = approx 2.056875e-24 s. Same as before. So that part is correct.

Wait, so the calculation of L is 6.1e-16 m. But the options are all about 4e-15 and 5e-15, which are an order of magnitude larger.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of velocity?

Wait, let's re-examine the calculation of beta.

Wait, E = 8 GeV, m c^2 = 1.2 GeV.

So E² = (pc)^2 + (m c²)^2.

So (pc)^2 = E² - (m c²)^2 = (8)^2 - (1.2)^2 = 64 - 1.44 = 62.56 (GeV)^2.

So pc = sqrt(62.56) GeV ≈ 7.91 GeV.

So p = 7.91 GeV / c.

But how to find beta? Because p = gamma m v.

We have p = gamma m v.

But gamma = E/(m c^2) = 8/(1.2) = 6.6667.

So p = gamma m v = (6.6667) * (1.2 GeV/c²) * v.

Wait, but wait, units are getting confusing.

Alternatively, since p c = 7.91 GeV, and m c^2 = 1.2 GeV.

So, p c = sqrt(E² - (m c^2)^2 ) = 7.91 GeV.

Then, beta = (p c) / (E) = 7.91 / 8 ≈ 0.98875.

Ah, that's right. Because beta can be written as (p c) / E.

Because, from E = gamma m c², and p c = gamma m v c, and beta = v/c.

So, p c = gamma m v c = gamma m c beta.

But E = gamma m c².

So, beta = (p c) / (E).

So beta = (7.91 GeV) / (8 GeV) = 0.98875. So yes, that's correct.

So v = 0.98875 c.

So, v = 0.98875 * 3e8 m/s ≈ 2.966e8 m/s.

So, same as before.

So, L = v * tau = 2.966e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.

Which is 2.966e8 * 2.056875e-24 = let me compute it more accurately.

2.966 * 2.056875 = ?

2 * 2.056875 = 4.11375.

0.966 * 2.056875 = let's compute:

2.056875 * 0.966.

Hmm,

2 * 0.966 = 1.932.

0.056875 * 0.966 ≈ 0.05485.

So total is approximately 1.932 + 0.05485 = 1.98685.

So total of 4.11375 + 1.98685 = 6.1006.

So 6.1006e-16 meters.

So L ≈ 6.1e-16 m. But none of the options match this. The options are:

A) 5.0223e-16 m

B)4.0655e-15

C)5.0223e-15

D)4.0655e-16.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of tau? Let me recheck.

Wait, another approach: Maybe the mean decay length is the Compton wavelength multiplied by gamma or something else. Wait, but I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for the mean path as c * tau * beta.

Wait, because L = v * tau = beta c tau.

So, L = beta c tau.

But in any case, I think I did that correctly.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the total decay width to lifetime correctly, then compute beta.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the decay length using the formula L = c * (tau) * beta.

Wait, but that's the same as what I did.

Hmm, another thought: Maybe the calculation uses the natural units where ħ = c = 1. But in that case, the formulas would be different.

Wait, if we use natural units (ħ = c = 1), then the lifetime tau is in units of inverse energy. So, tau = ħ / (Gamma) = 1 / Gamma in natural units.

But Gamma is 0.32 GeV, so tau in natural units is 1/(0.32 GeV) = (1 GeV^-1) / 0.32.

But to convert to seconds, we use the conversion factor 1 GeV^-1 ≈ 6.582e-25 seconds.

So, tau = (1/0.32) * 6.582e-25 s ≈ 2.056875e-24 s. Same as before.

So that part is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should compute beta multiplied by c times tau.

Wait, beta c tau = (0.98875)(3e8 m/s)(2.056875e-24 s).

So, 0.98875 *3e8 is 2.966e8 m/s.

Multiply by 2.056875e-24 s: 2.966e8 * 2.056875e-24 = 6.1006e-16 m.

So, same result.

But the options don't have this. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, let me check the problem statement again. The production energy is E_X=8GeV, mass 1.2 GeV, width 320 MeV.

Wait, perhaps the production energy is not the total energy, but the kinetic energy? No, the term 'production energy' probably refers to the total energy.

Wait, another thought: Maybe I should calculate the velocity using gamma = E/(m c^2). So gamma = 8/1.2 ≈ 6.6667.

Then, gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta^2). So beta^2 = 1 - 1/(gamma^2).

gamma is 6.6667, so gamma^2 is around 44.444.

So 1/(gamma^2) is ~0.0225. So beta^2 = 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775 → beta = sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887, same as before.

So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of velocity. Let me compute 0.9887 * 3e8.

0.9887 * 3e8 = 2.9661e8 m/s.

Yes, correct.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of tau.

Wait, let me recompute tau.

Gamma is 320 MeV = 0.32 GeV.

Hbar is 6.582e-25 GeV s.

So tau = hbar / Gamma = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = 2.056875e-24 s.

Yes.

So why is the result not matching any of the options? Let me see the options again.

Options:

A: 5.0223e-16 m

B:4.0655e-15 m

C:5.0223e-15 m

D:4.0655e-16 m.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of beta. Let me think again.

Another approach: calculate the momentum p.

p c = sqrt(E² - (m c²)^2) = sqrt(8^2 - 1.2^2) = sqrt(64 - 1.44) = sqrt(62.56) = approx 7.91 GeV.

So p = 7.91 GeV / c.

Then, beta = (p c) / E = 7.91 /8 ≈ 0.98875.

So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the formula for the mean decay length is different. Maybe it's (c * tau) * beta, which is the same as v * tau.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the velocity as (p c^2) / E, which is another way to express beta.

Yes, beta = (p c^2) / E.

Wait, p c = 7.91 GeV, so p c^2 = 7.91 GeV c.

So beta = (p c^2) / E = (7.91 GeV c) / (8 GeV) ) = 0.98875 c.

Wait, same as before.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that I used GeV for E and m, but perhaps in the calculation of beta, I should have considered units more carefully.

Wait, if E and m c^2 are in the same unit, then the ratio (m c^2)/E is unitless, which is correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the product.

Wait, 2.966e8 m/s multiplied by 2.056875e-24 s.

Let me compute this product more accurately.

Expressed as:

(2.966 × 1e8) × (2.056875 × 1e-24) = 2.966 × 2.056875 × 1e8-24 = 6.1006 × 1e-16 = 6.1006e-16 m.

So, 6.1e-16 meters.

But none of the options match that.

Wait, perhaps I should double-check the calculation of beta. Let me compute 7.91 /8.

7.91 /8 = 0.98875. So correct.

Hmm, perhaps the initial assumption that the mean path is v * tau is wrong. Maybe I should be using v * gamma * something else?

Wait, another thought: The formula for the mean decay length is L = c * gamma * beta * tau.

Wait, but gamma is 6.6667, beta is 0.98875, tau is 2.056875e-24 s.

So L = c * gamma * beta * tau.

Wait, c is 3e8 m/s.

Gamma is 6.6667, beta is 0.98875.

So:

L = (3e8 m/s) * 6.6667 * 0.98875 * 2.056875e-24 s.

Compute 6.6667 * 0.98875 ≈ 6.6 * 0.98875.

6 * 0.98875 = 5.9325.

0.6667 * 0.98875≈ 0.66 * 0.98875 ≈ 0.6525.

So total approx 6.585.

So, L ≈ 3e8 * 6.585 * 2.056875e-24.

Wait, wait, but that would be 3e8 * 6.585 * 2.056875e-24.

Wait, let me compute 6.585 * 2.056875 ≈ 13.57.

So, 3e8 * 13.57e-24 = 3 *13.57e-16 = 40.71e-16 m = 4.071e-15 m.

Wait, that's 4.07e-15 m, which is close to option B (4.0655e-15) or C (5.02e-15).

Wait, but why did I get 6.1e-16 before? Because I think I may have confused the formula for L.

Wait, perhaps the mean path is L = gamma * beta * c * tau.

Because tau is the proper lifetime, and the observed lifetime is gamma * tau, and the velocity is beta c, so L = v * gamma tau = beta c * gamma tau.

Which is the same as L = gamma beta c tau.

Wait, but earlier I calculated L as v * tau, which is beta c tau.

Wait, but I think I messed up the gamma factor. Because tau is the proper lifetime, but in the lab frame, the lifetime is gamma tau. So the mean path should be v multiplied by gamma tau, which is beta c multiplied by gamma tau.

So, L = beta c gamma tau.

Wait, in my earlier calculation, I used v * tau, which is beta c * tau. But I forgot to multiply by gamma.

Ah! So that's the mistake. I forgot to include the gamma factor.

So, the correct formula is L = v * gamma tau.

So, let me recalculate.

Gamma is 6.6667.

Tau is 2.056875e-24 s.

v = beta c = 0.98875 * 3e8 m/s ≈ 2.966e8 m/s.

So, L = v * gamma * tau.

So, 2.966e8 * 6.6667 * 2.056875e-24.

Wait, but wait, in terms of calculation steps:

L = beta c * gamma * tau.

So,

beta c = 2.966e8 m/s.

gamma = 6.6667.

tau = 2.056875e-24 s.

So,

L = (2.966e8) * 6.6667 * 2.056875e-24.

Compute 2.966e8 * 6.6667 = ?

2.966 * 6.6667 ≈ 19.773.

So 19.773e8 = 1.9773e9.

Then multiply by 2.056875e-24: 1.9773e9 * 2.056875e-24 = 1.9773 * 2.056875 * 1e-15.

1.9773 * 2.056875 ≈ 4.07. So L ≈ 4.07e-15 m.

Which is option B: 4.0655e-15 m, or option C:5.02e-15.

Wait, 4.07e-15 is very close to option B, which is 4.0655e-15.

So that must be the correct answer.

So the mistake earlier was forgetting to include gamma in the mean decay distance formula. The mean decay length is L = v * gamma * tau, not just v * tau.

So the correct answer is option B or D? Let me compute more accurately.

Let me compute each step more accurately.

Compute gamma: 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 6.6666667.

Compute beta: (7.91 GeV) /8 GeV = 0.98875.

Compute tau: 6.582e-25 GeV s / 0.32 GeV = 2.056875e-24 s.

Now, compute L = beta c gamma tau.

beta c = 0.98875 * 3e8 m/s = 2.96625e8 m/s.

gamma = 6.6666667.

gamma * beta c = 6.6666667 * 2.96625e8 = ?

6.6666667 * 2.96625 = let's compute.

6 * 2.96625 = 17.7975.

0.6666667 * 2.96625 ≈ 1.9775.

Total is 17.7975 + 1.9775 ≈ 19.775.

So, 19.775e8 m/s.

Multiply by tau: 19.775e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.

Which is 19.775 * 2.056875e-16 m.

Compute 19.775 * 2.056875.

19 * 2.056875 ≈ 39.079.

0.775 * 2.056875 ≈ 1.597.

Total is approx 40.676.

So, 40.676e-16 m = 4.0676e-15 m.

Which is very close to option B: 4.0655e-15 m.

So that's the correct answer.


To determine the mean decay distance of the meson resonance \( X \), we use the following steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the lifetime \( \tau \)
The lifetime \( \tau \) is related to the total decay width \( \Gamma \) via the Heisenberg uncertainty principle:
\[
\tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma}
\]
Given \( \Gamma = 320 \, \text{MeV} = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \) and \( \hbar \approx 6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV·s} \), we compute:
\[
\tau = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-25}}{0.32} = 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}.
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the velocity \( v \)
The velocity \( v \) is determined using the relativistic relation:
\[
\beta = \frac{v}{c} = \frac{p c}{E},
\]
where \( E = 8 \, \text{GeV} \) is the total energy, and \( m c^2 = 1.2 \, \text{GeV} \) is the rest energy. The momentum \( p c \) is derived from the relativistic energy-momentum relation:
\[
p c = \sqrt{E^2 - (m c^2)^2} = \sqrt{8^2 - 1.2^2} = \sqrt{64 - 1.44} = \sqrt{62.56} \approx 7.91 \, \text{GeV}.
\]
Thus:
\[
\beta = \frac{7.91}{8} \approx 0.98875, \quad v = \beta c \approx 0.98875 \cdot 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \approx 2.966 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the mean decay distance \( L \)
The mean decay distance is given by:
\[
L = v \cdot \tau \cdot \gamma,
\]
where \( \gamma = \frac{E}{m c^2} = \frac{8}{1.2} \approx 6.6667 \). Substituting \( v \approx 2.966 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), \( \tau = 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s} \), and \( \gamma \approx 6.6667 \):
\[
L = 2.966 \times 10^8 \cdot 6.6667 \cdot 2.056875 \times 10^{-24}.
\]
First, calculate \( 2.966 \cdot 6.6667 \approx 19.775 \). Then:
\[
L = 19.775 \cdot 2.056875 \cdot 10^{-16} \approx 40.676 \cdot 10^{-16} \, \text{m} \approx 4.0676 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}.
\]

### Step 4: Compare with the options
The calculated value \( L \approx 4.0676 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \) matches closely with option **B** (\( 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \)).

### Final Answer:
**Answer: B**
