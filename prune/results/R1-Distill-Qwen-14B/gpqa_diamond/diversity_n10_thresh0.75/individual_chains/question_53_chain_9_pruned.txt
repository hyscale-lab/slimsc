Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question says that there's a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. I'm told that the FTIR spectrum shows an ester group. So, ester groups typically have carbonyl peaks around 1730-1760 cm⁻¹, right? So that's a clue that the compound has an ester functional group.

Then, the 1H NMR spectrum has six signals. Let's break down what each part means. The six signals are divided into:

1. Two signals for aromatic-Hs.
2. Two signals for vinyl-Hs, one being a doublet and the other a doublet of quartets.
3. Two signals for –CH3 groups.
4. No signals for –CH2 groups.

Hmm, okay. So, the molecule doesn't have any CH2 groups. So any substituents on the ring probably don't have any CH2 groups. Let me think about possible structures.

Since it's a di-substituted benzene ring, the substituents are in positions that cause the aromatic protons to split into two signals. That could mean they're para to each other, or maybe ortho or meta, but for two signals, perhaps para. Because para substitution would result in two equivalent aromatic protons each in two positions, but wait, di-substituted could have different substitution patterns.

But wait, the compound has an ester group. Esters are usually R-O-CO-O-R', but wait, no, esters are R-O-CO-R'. So, the structure would have an ester linkage, like maybe an aryl ester, or maybe with an alkyl group attached.

Alternatively, perhaps one substituent is an ester group, like O-CO-O-R. Wait, no, ester groups are O-CO-O-R, but wait, the ester functional group is R-O-CO-R'. So in the structure, perhaps one substituent is an ester, maybe like O-CO-OCH2CH3 or something like that.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let's think about the NMR data again.

The aromatic region has two signals, meaning that the aromatic protons are in two different environments, but there are two types, perhaps. Wait, a di-substituted benzene would have either two or three signals depending on substitution. For example, if substituents are para, the aromatic protons would be two doublets (each pair of protons in similar environments). So maybe in this case, the two signals are each for two protons, each as a doublet.

Then, the vinyl-Hs: two signals—one is a doublet and the other a doublet of quartets. Vinyl protons are those attached to a double bond, like in an alkene or perhaps an aromatic ring. Wait, but the ring is aromatic, so maybe the substituents include a vinyl group, like a substituent that's a vinyl group attached to the ring.

Wait, but let me think. The substituents on the benzene ring could be an ester group and another group. Let's say one substituent is an ester group, like O-CO-O-R, and the other is a vinyl group. Wait, but a vinyl group would be a CH₂CH₂ group? No, vinyl is CH₂=CH-. So perhaps there's an ester group and a substituent that's a vinyl group attached to the ring.

Wait, but I'm a bit stuck. Let me try to sketch a possible structure. Let's imagine the benzene ring with two substituents: one is an ester group, and the other is a vinyl group attached via a single bond.

Wait, but vinyl groups are typically part of a double bond. So maybe the substituent is a vinyl ester or something else. Alternatively, perhaps one substituent is an ester and the other is a methylene group, but that might lead to CH2 groups. But wait, the NMR says there are no CH2 signals. So any substituent with CH2 would show up, but since there are none, the substituents probably don't have any CH
