Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here, and I'm a bit new to this stuff, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me see what the question is asking.

The question is about a particle in an isotropic three-dimensional potential. The potential is given by V(r) = (1/2)mω²r². I remember that this is the potential for a harmonic oscillator, and in three dimensions, it's called the 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator. The problem asks for the energy of the third excited state and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for that energy.

Hmm, right. So first, I need to recall how the energy levels work in a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator. I think the energy levels are quantized and depend on the quantum numbers in each direction. But wait, in 3D, the oscillator isn't just the sum of three 1D oscillators. Or is it? Oh, I think it is! Because the potential is separable in Cartesian coordinates, the total energy is the sum of the energies in each direction.

Wait, no, no. Actually, in the case of an isotropic 3D harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are given by E = (n + 3/2)ħω, where n is a non-negative integer. Wait, no, that can't be right. Wait, no, the sum of the quantum numbers in each direction is 2n, maybe? Or is it n_x + n_y + n_z = n_total, and E is proportional to (n_total + 3/2)ħω?

Wait, let me think again. In 1D, the energy levels are E_n = (n + 1/2) ħω, where n=0,1,2,... So in 3D, each direction contributes (n_i + 1/2) ħω, where n_i is the quantum number for that direction. So the total energy would be E = (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) ħω.

Alternatively, sometimes the principal quantum number is used, which is n = n_x + n_y + n_z. So E = (n + 3/2) ħω. But I'm not sure if that's the case. Wait, let's think in terms of states.

Each state is characterized by the three quantum numbers n_x, n_y, n_z. The energy depends on their sum. So
