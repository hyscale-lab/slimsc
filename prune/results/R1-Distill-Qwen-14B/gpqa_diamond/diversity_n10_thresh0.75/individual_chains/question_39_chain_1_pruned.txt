Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

We have a large number of identical systems—10,000 particles, all the same, under the same conditions. Each particle moves along a tube, which is the x-axis. The wave function for each particle is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Oh right, i is the square root of -1, and sqrt is the square root function.

When they measured the position of the particles, none were found at x less than 1 or greater than 3. So all the particles were found between x=1 and x=3. The question is asking for the value of 'a'. The options are A to D, with values 1.1, 0.85, 0.35, and 0.6.

Hmm, okay. I remember that in quantum mechanics, the wave function's square modulus (the probability density) must integrate to 1 over all space because the total probability of finding the particle somewhere must be 100%. So the integral of |ψ(x)|² dx from x=1 to x=3 should equal 1.

Wait, but the wave function given is ψ(x) = a/sqrt(1+x) - 0.5i. Let me write that down. So ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) ) - (0.5 i). Oh wait, but wait a second. In quantum mechanics, the wave function is usually written as a complex number, but here it's expressed as a sum of a real term and an imaginary term. Or maybe it's more like a complex function where the real part is a/sqrt(1+x), and the imaginary part is -0.5.

Wait, that might complicate things because when you take the modulus squared, you have to consider both parts. Wait, but maybe I'm misinterpreting. Let me think again. Oh, wait, perhaps the wave function is given as a complex expression, but if the wave function is a sum of a real part and an imaginary part, then ψ(x) = (a/sqrt(1+x)) ) - 0.5i. So the real part is (a/sqrt(1+x)), and the imaginary part is -0.5.

Wait, but that's a bit unusual. Because typically, the wave function would
