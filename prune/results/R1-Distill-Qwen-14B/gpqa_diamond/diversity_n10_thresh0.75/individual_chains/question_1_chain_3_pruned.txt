Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says. 

The problem states that there are two quantum states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. We need to find their energy difference so that they can be clearly distinguished. The options are A to D with various eV values.

Hmm, I remember that the uncertainty principle comes into play with energy and lifetime. Oh right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle says that the product of the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) and the uncertainty in time (Δt) is at least ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. 

Wait, but in this case, the lifetime of the states is given. So the lifetime is related to the uncertainty in time. I think the relation is ΔE ≈ ħ / τ, where τ is the lifetime. Wait, but the exact formula might be ΔE * τ ≈ ħ / 2. Or is it τ being the uncertainty in time? I think it's the latter. So the uncertainty in energy is about ħ divided by the lifetime.

So, for each state, their energy uncertainty is determined by their lifetime. But wait, the question is about the energy difference between E1 and E2. To clearly distinguish the two, the energy difference should be much larger than the uncertainty in each state's energy, right? Because if the energy difference is smaller than the uncertainties, you can't tell them apart.

Let me write the formula down. The uncertainty principle is ΔE * Δt ≥ ħ/2. Here, the Δt would be the lifetime τ of the state. So for each state, the uncertainty in energy is ΔE ≈ ħ / (2τ). But wait, let me double-check: I think the uncertainty in energy is approximately ħ divided by the lifetime. So ΔE ≈ ħ / τ.

Wait, no—actually, I think the more precise formula is ΔE ≈ ħ / (2τ). Because the uncertainty principle is ΔE Δt ≥ ħ/2. So if you take Δt as τ, then ΔE would be at least ħ/(2τ). So the minimum uncertainty in energy is about ħ/(2τ).

So for each state, E1 has a lifetime τ1 = 1e-9 seconds, and E2 has τ2 = 1e-8 seconds.

Wait, but the question is about the energy difference between E2 and E1. Let me see: If E2 is
