Okay, so I've got this question about quantum states and their energy differences. Hmm, I remember that the lifetime of a quantum state is related to its energy uncertainty. Right, Heisenberg's uncertainty principle comes into play here. The principle says that the product of the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) and the uncertainty in time (Δt) is greater than or equal to ħ/2. Wait, ħ is the reduced Planck's constant, which is about 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

The question gives two states with lifetimes of 1e-9 seconds and 1e-8 seconds. Wait, no, actually, the question says their energies are E1 and E2, each with their own lifetimes. Oh wait, no, I think I misread that. Let me check again. Oh, the question says the two states have lifetimes of 1e-9 sec and 1e-8 sec, respectively. So each state has a different lifetime, which affects the uncertainty in their energies.

We need to find the energy difference between them so that their levels can be clearly distinguished. So the energy difference must be larger than the uncertainty in energy for each state, right? Because if the energy difference is smaller than the uncertainty, we can't resolve them; they'd be seen as a single state.

Wait, but each state has its own uncertainty. So for each state, the uncertainty ΔE is approximately ħ divided by the lifetime. So for the first state, ΔE1 = ħ / τ1, and ΔE2 = ħ / τ2. Hmm, but wait, I think the uncertainty principle is ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2, so ΔE ≈ ħ/(2Δt), but sometimes people approximate it as ħ/Δt for order of magnitude estimates.

So let me compute the energy uncertainties for each state.

First, τ1 is 1e-9 seconds. So ΔE1 ≈ ħ / τ1 = (1.05e-34 J·s) / (1e-9 s) = 1.05e-25 J. Now, converting that to eV. I know that 1 eV is approximately 1.602e-19 J. So:

ΔE1 = (1.05e-25 J) / (1.602e-19 J/eV) ≈ 6.56e-7 eV. Wait, that's about 0.656 micro-eV.

Similarly, τ2 is 1e-8 s. So ΔE2 = ħ / τ2 = (1.05e-34) / (1e-8) = 1.05e-26 J. Convert
