Okay, so I've got this question about interstellar travel and time dilation. Let me think through this step by step. Alright, so the setup is that there's an alien civilization in the Large Magellanic Cloud who's sending a spacecraft to Earth. The ship is moving at 0.99999987 times the speed of light, which is super fast. The astronaut is 22 years old, and we need to find out how long the trip will take from their perspective. The options given are A through D, with A saying the astronaut dies before reaching Earth, and the others giving specific years.

Hmm, I remember that when you're moving at such high speeds, close to the speed of light, time dilation effects come into play. Time dilation is a concept from Einstein's theory of relativity. So, from the astronaut's frame of reference, the journey time would be shorter compared to someone observing from Earth. But wait, I'm a bit confused about how to calculate this.

Wait, the problem says that the average lifetime of these aliens is about 150 solar years. So the astronaut is 22, and if the trip takes more than about 128 years (from their perspective), they might not make it. But the options don't have that. Let me think again.

The key here is to figure out the proper time experienced by the astronaut. Proper time is the time measured in the moving frame, which in this case is the astronaut's frame. The formula for time dilation is from the perspective of the Earth: t_earth = gamma * t_proper, where gamma is the Lorentz factor. But wait, actually, in the astronaut's frame, the distance to Earth is contracted, so the time they experience is less.

Wait, maybe I should approach it using the Lorentz factor. The Lorentz factor gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - (v^2/c^2)). Since v is 0.99999987c, that's really close to the speed of light. Let me compute gamma.

So, v = 0.99999987 c. Let me compute (v/c)^2 which is (0.99999987)^2. Let me calculate that. 0.99999987 squared is approximately (1 - 1.3e-7)^2. Using approximation (1 - x)^
