Okay, so I've got this question about rotavirus and some experiments done on mice. I'm a bit rusty on immunology, but let's try to work through this.

The setup is that they tagged the inner capsid proteins of rotavirus with GFP and gave them to mice orally. Then, using in vivo imaging, they saw that some fluorescence was destroyed by stomach acid. That makes sense because the stomach is acidic, so maybe the proteins got broken down there. But some made it through, got entangled in intestinal mucus, and reached the secondary lymphoid organs, specifically the Peyer's patches. They isolated the proliferating cells there and looked at the variable heavy chain genes, which had high variability.

Hmm, what's happening here. So the rotavirus is being delivered to the gut, which is where a lot of mucosal immunity happens. Peyer's patches are part of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT), so that's where immune responses to things like oral antigens get initiated.

The question is about the process causing the variability in the variable heavy chain genes. The options are A) somatic hypermutation, B) complement activation, C) class switching recombination, D) VDJ recombination.

Wait, VDJ recombination is the process during B cell development when the variable, diversity, and joining segments are rearranged to form the heavy chain. That happens in the bone marrow during the early stages of B cell development, like during the pro-B cell stage. Once the B cell is mature, that process stops, right? So in this scenario, the cells have already been activated by the antigen, which is rotavirus. So VDJ is probably not the process here.

Class switching recombination, option C, is when the B cell changes the class of antibody it produces (like from IgM to IgG or IgA) without changing the variable regions. This process involves the activation of certain signals, like cytokines. But the question is about variable heavy chain variability, which isn't about class switching. So I can probably rule out C.

Option B is complement activation. Complement is part of the immune response, helping to tag pathogens for destruction. But I don't see how that directly relates to the variability in the variable regions. Complement activation is more about lysis or opsonization, not about generating diversity in the B cell receptors. So B might not be the right choice.

That leaves option A, somatic hypermutation. This is the process where B cells, upon activation by an antigen, undergo mutation in the variable regions of their antibody genes. This increases the diversity of the immune response and allows for affinity maturation. So when the B cells are proliferating in the lymph nodes or Peyer's patches, they undergo somatic hypermutation, leading to different variants of the same original B cell. Sequencing would show high variability because each cell has slightly different variable regions after this process.

Putting it together: The GFP-tagged proteins (probably as part of the rotavirus capsid) are taken up by the mice. Some reach the Peyer's patches, where B cells take them up. These B cells then activate and start proliferating. During this proliferation, they undergo somatic hypermutation, which increases the diversity of their antibodies. So the high variability in the variable heavy chain genes is due to A) somatic hypermutation.


The experiment involves tagging the inner capsid proteins of rotavirus with GFP and delivering them to mice via oral gavage. The fluorescence of these proteins is partially destroyed by stomach acid, but some reach the Peyer's patches, where they are taken up by B cells. These B cells proliferate, and sequencing of the variable heavy chain genes reveals high variability. The process responsible for this variability is somatic hypermutation, which occurs during the immune response when B cells are activated by an antigen. This process increases the diversity of the B cell receptor by introducing mutations in the variable regions of the antibody genes, leading to the observed high variability in the variable heavy chain genes.

Answer: A
