Alright, I'm faced with this quantum mechanics problem. Let me try to work through it step by step. Okay, so the question is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator Ay. 

The setup is that Ay is given as c multiplied by the matrix S. The constants are c = h/(4π), and S is a 2x2 matrix. The first row of S is (0, -i), and the second row is (i, 0). So I'll write out matrix S first:

S = [ [0, -i],
       [i, 0] ]

Now, c is h/(4π), so Ay = c * S. Let me compute what Ay looks like:

Ay = (h/(4π)) * [ [0, -i], [i, 0] ]
   = [ [0, -i*(h/(4π))],
        [i*(h/(4π)), 0] ]

Hmm, but wait, when you multiply a matrix by a scalar, each element is multiplied. So yeah, that's correct.

The problem says we need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. Oh right, eigenvalues are found by solving the characteristic equation det(Ay - λI) = 0.

So let me set up the matrix (Ay - λI):

[ -λ, (-i h)/(4π) ]
[ (i h)/(4π), -λ ]

The determinant of this matrix is (-λ)(-λ) - [ (-i h/(4π) )*(i h/(4π)) ) ]

Calculating each part: 

First term: λ².

Second term: [ (-i h/(4π) ) * (i h/(4π) ) ] = (-i)(i) * (h^2)/(16 π²). Let me compute (-i)(i) = -(i^2) = -(-1) = 1. So that term becomes (h²)/(16 π²).

So determinant equation: λ² - [ (h²)/(16 π²) ) ] = 0.

Wait, because the determinant formula is (a*d - b*c), so here a is -λ, d is -λ. So a*d is λ². b is (-i h/(4π)), c is (i h/(4π)). So b*c is (-i)(i)(h²)/(16 π²). Let me compute that: (-i)(i) = -i² = -(-1) = 1. So bc is (h²)/(16 π²). So determinant is λ² - (h²)/(16 π²) = 0.

Setting this to zero: λ² = (h²)/(16 π²). Taking square roots, λ = ± h/(4π).

Wait, but wait a second. Because when I write the determinant, the equation is λ² - [ (h²)/(16 π²) ) ] = 0 → λ² = h²/(16 π²) → λ = ± h/(4π). So the eigenvalues are ± h/(4π).

Wait, but looking at the options, let me see:

Option A says the imaginary part of the eigenvalue are ±2πh, which doesn't make sense because our eigenvalues are real numbers. Wait, no—wait, wait. Oh wait, no, the eigenvalues we found are real? Because S is a Hermitian matrix? Let me think about that.

Wait, matrix S: [0, -i; i, 0]. Is that Hermitian? Because for a matrix to be Hermitian, the conjugate transpose must equal the matrix itself. The conjugate transpose of S is [0, i; -i, 0], which is not equal to S. So S is not Hermitian. Hmm, but wait, the operator Ay is given as c*S, and in quantum mechanics, angular momentum operators are typically Hermitian because they correspond to observables. So maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check S again.

Wait, the given S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. Let me compute its conjugate transpose. The conjugate of S would be [[0, i], [-i, 0]]. The transpose of that would switch the off-diagonal elements: [[0, -i], [i, 0]], which is same as S. So S is Hermitian. Because S† = S. So then S is Hermitian, so Ay is c times a Hermitian matrix, so Ay is Hermitian. Therefore, its eigenvalues should be real. So the eigenvalues we found are real numbers: ± h/(4π).

So looking back at the options, option A claims the eigenvalue has imaginary parts ±2πh. That can't be right because our eigenvalues are real. So option A is out.

Option B says the imaginary parts are ±1/2 and real parts ±1. That doesn't fit because our eigenvalues are ± h/(4π), which are real. So B's eigenvalues are also real, but not the ones we have.

Wait, let me compute h/(4π): Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626e-34 J·s. But exact value isn't needed for the options. Let me see the options. Option B’s eigenvalues are ±1/2 and ±1 in real and imaginary parts. But our eigenvalues are ± h/(4π). So unless h/(4π) equals 1/2 (which I don't think it is), this can't be correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation? Let me double-check the determinant calculation. Matrix Ay is:

[ 0, (-i h)/(4π) ]
[ (i h)/(4π), 0 ]

So when I compute the determinant of (Ay - λ I), it's:

| -λ      (-i h)/(4
