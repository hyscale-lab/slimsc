Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Alright, let me try to think through this step by step.

The question is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator Ay. The operator is given as Ay = c·S, where c is h/(4π) and S is a 2x2 matrix. From what I remember, the Pauli matrices are involved in spin operators. Oh wait, the S matrix here has rows (0, -i) and (i, 0). That looks familiar. Oh right! That's the Y Pauli matrix divided by 2, maybe? Or wait, no. Wait, the standard Pauli matrices are σx, σy, σz. Let me write them down quickly in my mind.

The Pauli Y matrix σy is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So S is exactly σy. Because the first row is 0, -i; second row i, 0. So S is σy. So the operator Ay is c times σy.

So, Ay = c * σy. Since c is h/(4π), so Ay = (h/(4π)) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]].

To find the eigenvalues, I need to solve the characteristic equation det(Ay - λI) = 0.

So let's compute the matrix Ay - λI. That would be:

[ (h/(4π)) * 0
