Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with all the reactions, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem says that a compound with molecular formula C8H9NO is reacted with a series of reagents. Then, based on the NMR data, I need to figure out what the final product is. The options are A to D.

First, I'll try to figure out what the starting compound might be. The molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation. That's (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So, C=8, H=9, N=1, O=1. So, (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9+1)/2=10/2=5. So 5 degrees of unsaturation. That could be like a benzene ring (which accounts for 3), a double bond (another), and maybe an amide group or something else. Alternatively, maybe two rings or other structures.

Looking at the NMR data:

- 9.72 ppm triplet: That's a pretty high chemical shift, maybe an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes usually appear around 9-10 ppm. The triplet (1H) suggests maybe coupling with two adjacent protons. Wait, but an aldehyde proton is usually a triplet if adjacent to a CH2 group, but I'm not sure.

- 6.98 ppm doublet (2H): This might be part of a benzene ring, like para-substituted. Maybe two protons in a para position.

- 6.51 ppm doublet (2H): Another set of aromatic protons, also para-substituted perhaps. Maybe two different substituents on the benzene.

- 6.27 ppm broad singlet (2H): Hmm, broad singlet. Maybe some hydroxyl groups, but not integrating as two H. Or perhaps some vinyl protons adjacent to an oxygen? Or maybe it's a diol or something else.

- 3.66 ppm doublet (2H): This is around where CH2 groups attached to oxygen (like -OCH2-) appear. So maybe an ether
