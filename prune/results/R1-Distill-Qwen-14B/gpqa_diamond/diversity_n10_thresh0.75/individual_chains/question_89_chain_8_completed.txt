Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it's about a series of reactions starting from 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I'm a bit rusty on my adamantane structures, but I remember adamantane is a diamondoid hydrocarbon, kind of like a cage structure. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have bromine atoms at the 1 and 3 positions.

The first step is heating with excess KOH at 240°C. KOH is a strong base, and heating with bromo compounds often leads to elimination reactions. Since there are two bromine atoms, maybe it's a double elimination. Wait, but if it's 1,3-dibromo, elimination might form an allene or perhaps a conjugated diene? But more likely, given the conditions, it's an elimination to form an alkene.

Wait, in the H NMR spectrum of product 1, there's a peak at 4.79 ppm integrating to 2H. That's a deshielded environment, so maybe an alcohol or something with an oxygen nearby. Wait, no, the IR shows a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is characteristic of a carbonyl group. Oh, wait, that's a strong peak, probably an ester or ketone. But wait, product 1 is a light yellow solid—could it be an epoxide? No, because epoxide ring-opening with KOH would give a diol, but maybe elimination gives a ketone or an ester.

Wait, maybe it's an elimination leading to a ketone. Wait, if we have 1,3-dibromoadamantane reacting with KOH, perhaps dehydrohalogenation occurs. Since both Br atoms are on adjacent carbons (1 and 3?), but wait, in the structure of adamantane, the 1 and 3 positions are on adjacent carbons? I think adamantane has a structure where each carbon is connected to three others, so maybe 1 and 3 are on adjacent carbons. So elimination of two HBr molecules would form a double bond. But wait, if you eliminate two HBr, you get an alkene, and maybe if the base is strong enough, it could form a ketone via some mechanism. Wait, but I'm a bit confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a double elimination to form an allene, but that's less common. Alternatively, the reaction could be a double dehydrohalogenation, forming a diene. But wait, the IR peak is at 1720, which is more like an ester or ketone. So perhaps the product is a ketone.

Wait, maybe the KOH isn't just eliminating. If KOH is in excess and heated, maybe it's a nucleophilic substitution, but 1,3-dibromide is probably not a good candidate for that because it's vicinal dihalide. Vicinal dihalides under basic conditions usually undergo elimination to form alkenes. So maybe product 1 is an alkene. But then why does the IR show a carbonyl? Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the base abstracts a β-hydrogen, leading to elimination of HBr and formation of a double bond. So product 1 is an adamantadiene? But that wouldn't explain the carbonyl. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't stop at the alkene. Maybe the alkene undergoes further reaction. Wait, but being heated with KOH, perhaps it's a Hofmann elimination? No, Hofmann is for amines. Wait, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation followed by some kind of keto-enol tautomerism, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the NMR shows a peak at 4.79 ppm for 2H. That's often indicative of an ether or an alcohol, but given the IR peak at 1720, which is more like a carbonyl. So perhaps after elimination, there's an epoxide formation? But no, KOH would open an epoxide, not form it. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the product is a ketone, and the 4.79 ppm is something else.

Wait, another thought: when vicinal dihalides react with a strong base, they can undergo elimination to form alkenes, but sometimes, especially with bulky bases, could it form a carbonyl? Wait, no, elimination to an alkene is more likely. Unless there's some neighboring group participation or some kind of rearrangement, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the product is an epoxide. If KOH is a base, but in some cases, can act as an acid catalyst. Wait, but epoxide formation usually involves an acid catalyst, not a base. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I should think about the product structure. The IR at 1720 is probably a carbonyl, so maybe the product is an ester or a ketone. But how would that form from 1,3-dibromoadamantane and KOH?

Alternatively, perhaps the product is an alcohol. Wait, but the IR at 1720 would then not fit. So maybe the product is a ketone. If product 1 is a ketone, then the reaction steps make sense. How?

Wait, perhaps the base causes elimination, but in a way that forms a ketone. For example, if the two bromines are on adjacent carbons, and elimination leads to a carbonyl group. Wait, but elimination usually forms double bonds. Oh wait, unless the structure is such that elimination leads to a carbonyl. Like, for example, in the case of vicinal dihalides where elimination leads to a ketone. Wait, but I'm not sure about that. I thought that requires more specific conditions.

Wait, another approach: looking at product 1's NMR. The 4.79 ppm is 2H, maybe an -OCH2- group? Or perhaps a CH2 next to an oxygen. Alternatively, maybe it's an epoxide where two protons are adjacent to the oxygen. But epoxide protons typically appear around 3.5-4.5 ppm, so 4.79 seems a bit high, but possible.

But wait, the IR peak is at 1720, which is more in line with an ester or a ketone. So there must be a carbonyl group.

Wait, could product 1 be an epoxide with a ketone group? That seems unlikely because the starting material is a dihalide. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the steps.

1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH (excess) → product 1.

Product 1 has IR 1720 cm-¹ → likely a carbonyl. So maybe product 1 is an epoxide with a carbonyl group? Or perhaps a ketone.

Wait, another thought: maybe the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution followed by elimination. No, substitution would give a single product, but maybe with two Brs, it's a double substitution. But in that case, we would have a diol, but then why the carbonyl IR?

Wait, perhaps the KOH is acting as a base, causing elimination of HBr twice, forming a conjugated diene, but then maybe some oxidation happens. But the conditions are just heating, so oxidation is less likely. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation to form a double bond, and then that double bond is subjected to some reaction.

Wait, maybe the product is an enol ether or something with an oxygen. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a ketone. Let's say that elimination leads to a carbonyl group. But how?

Wait, another approach: the IR peak at 1720 is a strong carbonyl absorption. So product 1 is a carbonyl-containing compound. So perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation to form a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Upon elimination of two HBr molecules, it could form a conjugated diene or a carbonyl. How?

Wait, in some cases, vicinal dihalides can undergo elimination to form ketones when they're on a bridgehead, but I'm not exactly sure about that.

Wait, maybe the product is an epoxide. But then the IR wouldn't show a carbonyl. So maybe that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is an example of beta-elimination, leading to the formation of a carbonyl. Wait, perhaps when two adjacent Br atoms are present, elimination can form a carbonyl group instead of an alkene. I'm not sure about that mechanism, but I'll go with that for now.

Assuming product 1 is a ketone, then the NMR shows a peak at 4.79 ppm for 2H. That might be an adjacent CH2 group. Alternatively, perhaps the NMR peak is from a -CH2-O- group, as in an epoxide.

Wait, but if the product is a ketone, then the 4.79 ppm could be an alcohol or an ether. Hmm.

But perhaps I should think about the next steps. Because the second step is heating product 1 with excess aluminum isopropoxide. Aluminum isopropoxide is a Lewis acid, often used as a catalyst in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. But product 1 is supposed to be a solid, so perhaps it's a ketone or an ester.

Wait, if product 1 is a ketone, then heating with Al(i-Pr)3 would do... nothing? Because Friedel-Crafts requires an aromatic ring to acylate. Or maybe product 1 is an ester, which could undergo some kind of acylation.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an epoxide with an adjacent carbonyl group. Then, when Al isopropoxide is added, perhaps it's a ring-opening of the epoxide.

But I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to retrace.

Product 1: 1,3-dibromoadamantane → KOH → product 1.

Assume product 1 is an epoxide. So the Br atoms are eliminated as HBr, and the two adjacent carbons form an epoxide ring. But then, the IR wouldn't show a carbonyl. So that can't be.

Wait, maybe it's an elimination to form a ketone. So perhaps the two Brs are on adjacent carbons, and elimination results in a carbonyl group. But I'm not sure about that mechanism.

Wait, another angle: the H NMR of product 1 shows 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H).

The 10H in 2.41-2.23 ppm could be from a set of equivalent CH2 groups in an adamantane structure. Since adamantane has a lot of equivalent protons in different environments, but after substitution, some become split.

The 1.94 (2H) could be from a methylene group adjacent to a carbonyl or an oxygen.

The 4.79 (2H) might be an -OCH2- group, perhaps part of an ether or an epoxide.

Wait, but the IR shows a carbonyl, so perhaps it's a ketone or ester. So maybe the product is a ketone with an adjacent oxygen group, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a ketone and an epoxide, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, another possibility: the reaction is a double elimination to form a conjugated diene. Then, product 1 is a diene. But then the IR wouldn't show a carbonyl. So that's probably not it.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck. Maybe I should think about the second step. Product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. Aluminum isopropoxide is a strong Lewis acid. So perhaps product 1 is an ester, which then undergoes some kind of acylation, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a ketone, and product 2 is an acylium ion or something, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another thought: if product 1 is a ketone, then heating with a Lewis acid like Al(i-Pr)3 might lead to some kind of ring expansion or other rearrangement. Or perhaps it's a Friedel-Crafts acylation if product 1 is an aromatic ketone, but I don't think adamantane is aromatic.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is an epoxide, and the Lewis acid catalyzes its ring-opening. But again, I'm not certain.

Let me think about the third step. Product 2 is treated with ozone at -78°C, then dimethyl sulfide is added. Ozonolysis is typically used to cleave alkenes into carbonyl compounds. So product 2 must have a double bond somewhere.

Wait, if product 2 has a double bond, then product 3 would be the ozonolysis products, which are carbonyl compounds. But the question is about the NMR of product 3, specifically the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen.

Wait, let me outline the steps again:

1. 1,3-dibromoadamantane → KOH heat → product 1 (light yellow solid, IR 1720, NMR as given)
2. Product 1 → Al(i-Pr)3 heat → product 2.
3. Product 2 → ozonolysis → product 3.

So, product 3 is formed from ozonolysis, which breaks double bonds. So product 2 must have a double bond.

So, if product 2 has a double bond, then product 1 must have undergone some reaction to form that. So, the second step is Al(i-Pr)3, which is a Lewis acid. So, maybe product 1 is an ester or a ketone, and in the presence of Al(i-Pr)3, it undergoes some kind of elimination to form a double bond.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a diol. If KOH caused both bromines to undergo substitution, forming a diol. Then, heating with Al(i-Pr)3 might cause dehydration to form an alkene. But then, the IR of product 1 wouldn't have a carbonyl. Hmm.

Alternatively, if product 1 is a ketone, then maybe the Al(i-Pr)3 acts as a catalyst for some kind of elimination, forming an alkene adjacent to the ketone. Then, product 2 would have a conjugated enone system.

Wait, that could make sense. Let's say product 1 is a ketone. Then, in the second step, elimination occurs, perhaps forming a conjugated dienone or a single enone. Then, product 2 has a double bond adjacent to a carbonyl group.

Then, ozonolysis would break the double bond into two carbonyl groups. So, product 3 would have carbonyls where the double bond was.

But the question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3. So, perhaps these are protons adjacent to carbonyl groups.

Wait, in ozonolysis, the double bond is cleaved, and depending on the structure, the products can have carbonyl groups. If the starting alkene was part of a larger structure, the ozonolysis would generate two carbonyl compounds.

But I'm not entirely sure about the exact structures. Maybe I should try to draw the possible structures.

Let me try to reconstruct the possible structures.

Step 1: 1,3-dibromoadamantane → KOH heat.

Assume elimination occurs, possibly forming an alkene. But with IR at 1720, perhaps it's a ketone.

Wait, another possibility: if the two bromines are on adjacent carbons, elimination of two HBr would form a carbonyl group. Let's imagine the structure as follows:

Br
   \
C - C
   /
Br

Elimination would form O=C=O? No, that can't be right. Maybe forming a ketone if there's a hydrogen adjacent.

Wait, perhaps the structure is such that elimination leads to a ketone. For example, if the two Brs are on carbons that are both connected to another carbon that can form a carbonyl. Let me think about the structure of adamantane.

Adamantane is a diamondoid, with four cyclohexane rings fused together. In 1,3-dibromoadamantane, the two Br atoms are on adjacent bridgehead carbons. So, perhaps elimination of two HBr would form a double bond between these two bridgehead carbons. But bridgehead double bonds are generally not allowed in adamantane due to Bredt's rule. Wait, Bredt's rule states that bridgehead double bonds are not possible in certain bridged bicyclic compounds. So, perhaps elimination doesn't form a double bond between the bridgeheads. So, maybe the elimination happens elsewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction forms an epoxide. If both Brs are on adjacent carbons, and elimination with base forms an epoxide. But then the IR wouldn't show a carbonyl. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps instead of elimination, substitution occurs. But with KOH, substitution would form a hydroxide, but with two Brs, maybe a diol. But then the IR wouldn't show a carbonyl. So that's conflicting.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the NMR data again.

Product 1:

1H NMR:
- 4.79 ppm (2H)
- 2.41-2.23 ppm (10H)
- 1.94 ppm (2H)

The 10H in the 2.4-2.23 region could be from a set of methylene groups in the adamantane structure. The 1.94 ppm (2H) might be adjacent to an electronegative group, like oxygen or a carbonyl. The 4.79 ppm (2H) could be a methylene adjacent to an oxygen, perhaps part of an epoxide or an ether.

Wait, another thought: maybe product 1 is an epoxide, so the 4.79 ppm is the two protons on the epoxide. Epoxide protons usually appear around 3.5-4.5 ppm, so 4.79 is a bit upfield, but possible. The IR peak at 1720 could be from a carbonyl elsewhere, but if product 1 is an epoxide, where is the carbonyl coming from?

Wait, perhaps the product is a ketone and an epoxide. But that would require a more complex structure.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is a cyclic ether with a ketone group nearby. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the 1720 cm-1 peak is from an ester. So product 1 could be an ester. How would that form from 1,3-dibromoadamantane and KOH?

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diol, but then the IR wouldn't match. Unless the diol undergoes some kind of oxidation. But under those conditions, I don't see how oxidation would occur.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Let me think about the second step. Product 1 is treated with excess Al(i-Pr)3 upon heating, which is a Lewis acid. So, if product 1 is an ester, perhaps it undergoes some acylation. Or, if it's a diol, perhaps it loses water to form a double bond.

Wait, product 1 could be a diol. Then, when treated with Al(i-Pr)3, which is a strong Lewis acid, perhaps it dehydrates to form an alkene. So product 2 would be an alkene.

Then, product 2 is ozonolysed, which breaks the double bond into two carbonyl groups. So product 3 would have two carbonyl groups.

But then, the question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded H in product 3. These would likely be protons adjacent to carbonyl groups.

In ozonolysis, the cleavage of a double bond typically leads to two carbonyl compounds. So, in product 3, each fragment would have a carbonyl, and any adjacent protons would show coupling.

But the coupling pattern depends on the neighboring protons. For example, if a proton is adjacent to another set of protons, it can show triplet, quartet, etc.

Wait, but the most deshielded H would be the one closest to the carbonyl group. So, in each fragment, the protons adjacent to the carbonyl would be deshielded.

Let me imagine the structure. Suppose product 2 is an alkene, say between two bridgehead carbons. Ozonolysis would cleave this into two carbonyl groups.

Each of these fragments would have a carbonyl, and perhaps some adjacent protons.

If the original alkene was between two CH2 groups, then ozonolysis would produce two ketones with adjacent CH2 groups. The protons on the CH2 groups next to the carbonyl would be deshielded.

In the case of a CH2 next to a carbonyl, the protons would typically be split by adjacent protons. For instance, each CH2 group would have two protons, each coupling with the other. So, each H would be a triplet if adjacent to another CH2 group.

Wait, but in ozonolysis, the structure could be such that the protons are in a CH2 group adjacent to the carbonyl. So, each H on CH2 would couple with the other H on the same CH2 (giving a doublet) and with any neighboring groups.

Alternatively, if each CH2 is between two carbonyl groups, then each CH2 would have neighboring Hs.

Wait, perhaps the product 3 has a structure like O=C-R, where R is a CH2 group. The protons on the CH2 would be adjacent to the carbonyl and coupled with each other.

In such a case, each H on the CH2 would be a triplet because each H is coupled with two identical Hs (the other on the same CH2), but wait, that would be a doublet. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps each CH2 is a methylene group between two carbonyls, so each H is adjacent to two other Hs on the same CH2. So, each H would couple with two others, leading to a triplet.

Alternatively, if the CH2 is adjacent to another CH2 group, then each H would have coupling with two Hs on its own CH2 and perhaps two Hs on the adjacent CH2 group, leading to a triplet of triplets.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the most deshielded Hs are part of an acetal or another structure where they're adjacent to more than one set of Hs.

Wait, maybe the ozonolysis produces a diketone, where the carbonyl groups are adjacent to CH2 groups. So, each CH2 group's protons would be next to two other CH2 groups, leading to more splitting.

But this is getting complicated. Let me think about the options.

The options are:

A) triplet
B) triplet of triplets
C) doublet of triplets
D) pentet

The coupling pattern depends on the number of neighboring Hs.

If a proton is next to a CH2 group (two Hs) and another CH2 group (two Hs), then each H would split into a triplet due to the two Hs on each adjacent CH2. But wait, if each H is coupled with two different sets of Hs, then the splitting would be more complex.

Alternatively, if a H is adjacent to a CH2 (two Hs) and another CH2 (two Hs), the coupling would be a triplet from each, leading to a triplet of triplets.

But wait, let me think about how splitting works. When a proton is split by two different sets of neighboring protons, the splitting is a combination of their individual couplings. So, a proton adjacent to two groups (each with n and m protons) will have a splitting pattern of n+1 and m+1, leading to a multiplet.

In the case where a H is next to a CH2 (two Hs) on each side, each CH2 contributes a triplet. So, the overall pattern would be a triplet of triplets.

But wait, let's take an example: imagine a structure like R-CO-CH2-CH2-CO-R'. Ozonolysis would break the double bond, perhaps leading to two carbonyl groups. The CH2 groups next to the carbonyls would have protons.

Each CH2 group's protons would be coupled with the two protons on their own CH2 and the two on the adjacent CH2. But wait, each CH2 is connected to another CH2, so each H on a CH2 is adjacent to two Hs on the same CH2 and two Hs on the neighboring CH2.

So, each H would be split by the two Hs on the same CH2 (giving a triplet) and also by the two Hs on the adjacent CH2 (another triplet). So, the splitting would be a triplet of triplets, making 3 x 3 = 9 peaks, but that's unlikely and perhaps it's a more complex splitting.

Alternatively, perhaps the splitting is simpler. For instance, each CH2 group's Hs are only coupled with the Hs on the adjacent CH2, but not the same CH2 (if they're equivalent). But wait, in a CH2 group, the two Hs are equivalent and don't split each other, so each H only sees the adjacent CH2's Hs.

Wait, no, in a CH2 group, the two Hs are equivalent, so each H doesn't split the other. So, each H on a CH2 would only be split by the Hs on the neighboring CH2. If the neighboring group is a CH2 with two Hs, each H would split into a triplet (from two Hs). So, each H would be a triplet.

Wait, but if a H is coupled with two Hs on one side and two Hs on the other, that would lead to a triplet of triplets. But I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the most deshielded Hs are adjacent to only one other set of Hs, making a triplet.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is such that each CH2 is only adjacent to another CH2, leading to each H being a triplet.

But I'm not entirely certain. Let me think about the ozonolysis product. If product 2 is an alkene, say, between two CH2 groups, then ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl groups. Each would have a CH2 group next to the carbonyl.

So, the structure would be something like O=C-CH2-CH2-CO-O, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe each fragment is a ketone with a CH2 group.

So, the H NMR would show the CH2 groups next to the carbonyl. Each H in the CH2 would couple with two Hs on the same group (but they're equivalent, so no splitting) and perhaps two Hs on the adjacent CH2 group. Wait, if the two CH2 groups are adjacent, each H would be next to two Hs on the same CH2 and two Hs on the neighboring CH2.

So, each H is coupled to two Hs, which would cause a triplet. But because they're also coupled to another two Hs on the other CH2, the splitting would be a triplet of triplets.

But wait, I think that when a proton is coupled to two different sets of protons (each with n and m protons), the splitting pattern becomes (n+1)(m+1). So if each H is coupled to two Hs from one group and two from another, that would be (2+1)(2+1) = 9 peaks, which is a nonet. But none of the options are a nonet.

Alternatively, perhaps the coupling is between the CH2 and another group with more Hs, leading to a different pattern.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think of a simpler structure. Suppose the ozonolysis produces two identical carbonyl compounds, each with a single CH2 group adjacent to the carbonyl. Then, each CH2 group's protons would have no other neighboring Hs, making them singlets. But that's not the case because the options don't include a singlet.

Alternatively, if each CH2 is adjacent to another CH2, each H would be a triplet due to coupling with the two Hs on the neighboring CH2. So, the coupling pattern would be a triplet.

But wait, another possibility: the most deshielded Hs are in a di-substituted position, each coupled with two equivalent Hs, leading to a triplet.

But I'm still not entirely sure.

Wait, let me think about the initial steps again.

Product 1: IR 1720 → carbonyl.

So product 1 is a carbonyl compound. Then, product 2 is formed by heating with Al(i-Pr)3, which is a Lewis acid. So perhaps product 1 is an ester, and product 2 is an acylated product. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, if product 1 is a ketone, and product 2 is an enol ether or something else, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe product 1 is a ketone, and product 2 is an enol ether, which upon ozonolysis would break into carbonyl compounds.

But I'm not getting anywhere. Let me try to think about the possible structures.

Assume product 1 is a ketone. Then, product 2 is formed by elimination, perhaps forming a conjugated enone. Then, ozonolysis would break the double bond into two carbonyl groups.

The most deshielded H in product 3 would be adjacent to a carbonyl group. So, perhaps each of these Hs is a methylene group adjacent to a carbonyl.

In that case, each H would be coupled with two Hs on the same CH2 (but they are equivalent, so no splitting) and the two Hs on the adjacent CH2 group (if any). So, each H would be split into a triplet.

Wait, but if each H is only adjacent to one CH2 group (two Hs), then each H would be a triplet.

So, the coupling pattern would be a triplet, which is option A.

Alternatively, if each H is coupled with more Hs, the pattern could be more complex.

But given the options, and the reasoning, I think the correct answer is triplet, option A.


The problem involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Here's the analysis:

1. **Reaction with KOH**:  
   Heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with excess KOH likely results in a double elimination of HBr, forming a carbonyl-containing compound. The IR spectrum of the product (product 1) shows a strong absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹, characteristic of a carbonyl group. The NMR data for product 1 includes a peak at 4.79 ppm (2H), which could correspond to a methylene group adjacent to an oxygen or carbonyl group, and other peaks consistent with an adamantane-derived structure.

2. **Reaction with Al(i-Pr)₃**:  
   Product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide (a Lewis acid). This step likely facilitates further reaction, such as dehydration or rearrangement, forming product 2. Product 2 contains a double bond, as indicated by the subsequent ozonolysis step.

3. **Ozonolysis**:  
   Ozonolysis of product 2 cleaves the double bond, forming product 3, which contains carbonyl groups. The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is adjacent to a carbonyl group. This hydrogen would couple with neighboring protons, leading to a specific splitting pattern.

4. **Coupling Pattern in Product 3**:  
   The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is adjacent to a methylene group (CH₂) next to a carbonyl. Each hydrogen in this CH₂ group is coupled with two equivalent hydrogens on the same CH₂ group (no splitting within the group due to equivalence) and potentially with hydrogens on adjacent groups. Based on the splitting rules, this results in a **triplet** coupling pattern.

Critical analysis of the options:  
- **A) Triplet**: Matches the expected coupling pattern for a hydrogen adjacent to a CH₂ group.  
- **B) Triplet of triplets**: This would require coupling with two distinct sets of protons, which is less likely in this structure.  
- **C) Doublet of triplets**: This would require coupling with one proton and a triplet splitting, which is not consistent with the structure.  
- **D) Pentet**: This would require coupling with four equivalent protons, which is not supported by the structure.

The most consistent coupling pattern for the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is a **triplet**. 

Answer: A
