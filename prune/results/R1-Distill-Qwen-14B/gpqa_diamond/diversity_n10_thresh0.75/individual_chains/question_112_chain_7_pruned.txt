Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some concepts, but I'll take it slow.

The problem says that the state |alpha> is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. Oh right, |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. So, first, I need to find the actual state vector because the question says it's proportional. I think that means I need to normalize it.

Wait, to normalize, I need to find the norm of the vector. The norm squared is the sum of the magnitudes squared of each component. So for |alpha>, the coefficients are (1+i) and (2 - i). The magnitude of (1+i) is sqrt(1^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(2). The magnitude of (2 - i) is sqrt(2^2 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(4 +1) = sqrt(5). So the norm squared is (sqrt(2))^2 + (sqrt(5))^2 = 2 +5 =7. So the norm is sqrt(7). Therefore, the normalized state is [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ] |up> + [ (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ] |down>.

Alright, so the state is now |alpha> = (1+i)|up>/(sqrt(7)) + (2 -i)|down>/(sqrt(7)).

Next part: the operator whose matrix representation has elements A_ij = ħ/2 if i≠j, and 0 otherwise. So wait, what's the matrix look like? Since it's a 2x2 matrix for spin-up and spin-down states.

In the basis |up> and |down>, the matrix would be:

[ 0, ħ/2
  ħ/2, 0 ]

Because the diagonal elements are zero (since i must not equal j) and the off-diagonal are ħ/2.

Hmm, wait, so this operator is similar to the Pauli X matrix but scaled. The Pauli X is [[0,1],[1,0]], so this operator is (ħ/2) * X. Because each off-diagonal element is (ħ/2) instead of 1. So the operator A can be written as (ħ/2) σ_x, where σ_x is the Pauli X matrix.

Now, the question is to find the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of this operator. Oh wait, the operator is A, and we need to find the probability when measuring in the eigenbasis of A. So the eigenstates of A are the eigenstates of σ_x, because A is proportional to σ_x.

Wait, the eigenvalues of σ_x are ±1. So the eigenvalues of A would be (ħ/2)(±1) = ± ħ/2. The corresponding eigenvectors are the eigenstates of σ_x, which are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), right?

So, to find the probabilities, I need to express |alpha> in terms of these eigenstates of A. The probability of measuring a particular eigenvalue is the square of the amplitude of the corresponding eigenstate in |alpha>.

So let me compute the components. Let me denote the eigenstates as |+> and |->, where |+> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and |-> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

Wait, actually, σ_x has eigenstates |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and |−x> = (|up> − |down>)/sqrt(2). So I need to express |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |−x> to find the probabilities.

So, |alpha> = c_+ |+x> + c_- |−x>. The probabilities are |c_+|^2 and |c_-|^2.

To find c_+ and c_-, I can express |alpha> as a linear combination of |+x> and |−x>.

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to compute the inner products. So, < +x | alpha > = c_+, and < -x | alpha > = c_-.

Let me compute < +x | alpha >.

So, < +x | = [ <up| + <down| ] / sqrt(2).

And |alpha> is (1+i)|up>/sqrt(7) + (2 -i)|down>/sqrt(7).

So,

< +x | alpha > = [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) * <up| + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) * <down| ] [ ( <up| + <down| ) / sqrt(2) ]

Wait, perhaps more accurately, it's:

< +x | alpha > = (1/sqrt(2)) [ <up| + <down| ] [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7) )

Wait, no: the
