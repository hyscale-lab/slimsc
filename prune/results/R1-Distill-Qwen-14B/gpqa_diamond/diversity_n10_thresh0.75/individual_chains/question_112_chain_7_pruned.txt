Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem. Let me read through it again and make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem gives me the state |alpha> of an electron, which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. Here, |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. So, these are the standard spin-up and spin-down states along the z-axis.

The first part asks me to calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of another operator. This operator has a matrix representation where A_ij is hbar/2 if i is not equal to j, and zero otherwise. So, it's a 2x2 matrix because there are two states. Let me write that matrix out.

The matrix A would look like:
[  0     hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2  0    ]

Wait, that makes sense because when i ≠ j, the element is hbar/2. So rows and columns are for i and j, respectively, I think.

Next, I need to find the eigenstates of this operator A. Because when we measure an observable, the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues of the operator, and the probabilities are the squared magnitudes of the projections onto the corresponding eigenstates.

So, my first task is to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of matrix A.

Let me start by finding the eigenvalues. The eigenvalues λ satisfy the characteristic equation det(A - λ I) = 0.

The matrix A is:
[0   hbar/2]
[hbar/2 0]

So, subtracting λ from the diagonal, the matrix becomes:
[-λ   hbar/2]
[hbar/2  -λ]

The determinant of this matrix is (λ^2) - (hbar/2)^2.

Setting this equal to zero gives:
λ^2 - (hbar^2)/4 = 0
λ^2 = (hbar^2)/4
So λ = ± hbar/2.

Wait, that's interesting. So the eigenvalues are +hbar/2 and -hbar/2.

Now, to find the eigenstates corresponding to each eigenvalue.

For λ = hbar/2:
The matrix (A - λ I) is:
[-hbar/2   hbar/2]
[hbar/2   -hbar/2]

This gives the equations:
(-hbar/2) a + (hbar/2) b = 0
(hbar/2) a + (-hbar/2) b = 0

Simplify each equation:
- a + b = 0 → a = b

So the eigenvector can be written as [1, 1]^T (up to a scalar multiple). But since we can have any scalar, the normalized eigenvector would be 1/sqrt(2) (|up> + |down>).

Similarly, for λ = -hbar/2:
The matrix (A - (-hbar/2) I) is:
[hbar/2   hbar/2]
[hbar/2   hbar/2]

The equations are:
(hbar/2) a + (hbar/2) b = 0 → a + b = 0 → a = -b

So the eigenvector is [1, -1]^T, normalized to 1/sqrt(2) (|up> - |down>).

Wait a second, I should double-check this. Because if I plug in |up> + |down> into A, what do I get? A times (|up> + |down>) would be [ (0|up> + (hbar/2)|down>) + (hbar/2 |up> + 0|down>) ] = (hbar/2)(|up> + |down>), which is correct for λ = hbar/2. And for |up> - |down>, A acting on that would give (hbar/2)(|down> - |up>) = -hbar/2 (|up> - |down>), which is correct.

So the eigenstates are (|up> ± |down>)/sqrt(2). Let me denote these as |+> and |->, where |+> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and |-> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

Wait, but wait another thing. The matrix A is actually anti-diagonal. So its eigenvectors are the ones I found.

Now, the next step is to find the probability of measuring each eigenvalue when the system is in state |alpha>. But since |alpha> isn't necessarily in the eigenbasis of A, I need to express |alpha> in terms of these eigenstates |+> and |->.

Alternatively, the probability of measuring λ = hbar/2 is the square of the amplitude of |+> in |alpha>, and similarly for λ = -hbar
