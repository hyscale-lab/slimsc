Okay, so I've got this problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's read through the question carefully and break it down.

The question involves a mixture X, which is an equimolar mixture of two liquids. This mixture X can decolorize bromine water. Then, when treated with platinum and heat, it undergoes a reaction to form mixture Y, which is also equimolar but consists of two other liquids. Importantly, mixture Y doesn't decolorize bromine water anymore. 

Hydrogenation of both X and Y using platinum under severe conditions yields only one substance, Z. Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen being 14.28%. Z is part of mixture Y and is used as a solvent. Also, Z doesn't react further with hydrogen. Additionally, there are no conjugated multiple bonds in the molecules of X's compounds.

I need to find the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.

Hmm, let's try to unpack this.

First, mixture X decolorizes bromine water. That suggests that X contains compounds that can undergo addition reactions with bromine, which usually involves alkenes or alkynes. But wait, the question says that there are no conjugated multiple bonds in X. So, X might have non-conjugated double bonds, or maybe something else that can decolorize bromine. Another possibility is that X contains aromatic rings, which can also decolorize bromine through addition, but without conjugation, maybe it's alkenes.

But wait, X is treated with platinum and heated, leading to a disproportionation reaction to form Y. Disproportionation implies that a single species is both oxidized and reduced. So, maybe X contains a compound that can disproportionate into two different compounds. For example, maybe something like an alkene undergoing some kind of reaction to form a diol or other products. Alternatively, maybe it's a di-substituted alkene that becomes something else.

Wait, when X is treated with Pt and heat, it forms Y via disproportionation. So, maybe X contains a substance that can split into two different substances. One possible scenario is that X has a compound that can undergo dehydrohalogenation or some elimination, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps X contains an alkyne, but I'm not certain.

Wait, when X is hydrogenated, along with Y, under severe conditions, it gives Z. Z is a hydrocarbon, and its mass fraction of hydrogen is 14.28%. Let's calculate Z's molecular formula.

The mass fraction of hydrogen is 14.28%, which is 1/7. So, the molecular formula of Z would have hydrogen contributing 1/7 of the molecular mass. So, let's assume Z is a hydrocarbon with formula CnHm.

The mass of hydrogen is (m * 1) / (12n + m) ) = 1/7.

So,

(m) / (12n + m) = 1/7

Cross-multiplying:

7m = 12n + m

6m = 12n â†’ m = 2n.

So, Z has formula CnH2n. Which suggests it's an alkene or alkyne, but wait, Z doesn't react further with hydrogen, so it must be something that doesn't have any more unsaturated bonds. Wait, but if it's CnH2n, that would be a double bond. But wait, if Z doesn't react with H2, then maybe it's something like a cyclic compound, like cyclopropane, which is strained but doesn't react under normal conditions. Alternatively, maybe it's an aromatic compound, but aromatic rings typically require higher temperatures to hydrogenate. Hmm.

Wait, the question says Z is a constituent of mixture Y. So, Y must have Z as one of its components.

Let me think about Y. Y is formed by the disproportionation of X. So, perhaps X contains a compound that, upon heating with platinum, breaks down into two different compounds, one of which is Z. But wait, X gives Y via a
