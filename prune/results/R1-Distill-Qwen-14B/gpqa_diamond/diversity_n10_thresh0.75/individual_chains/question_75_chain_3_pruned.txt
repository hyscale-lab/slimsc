Okay, so I'm trying to figure out why the GADD45G protein isn't being overexpressed in the mouse model. The researcher introduced a coding sequence with an influenza hemagglutinin tag at the N-terminus. They transfected the plasmid into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells using Lipofectamine, and selected antibiotic-resistant colonies. But when they tested the expression, the protein wasn't overexpressed.

Looking at the provided DNA sequence, the plus strand starts with ATG, which is the start codon. The sequence then continues with some codons. I need to check if there's anything wrong with the reading frame or possible premature termination codons that would cause the ribosome to stop early.

Hmm, the question says the sequence is the plus strand, so it's the coding (non-template) strand. Let me scan through for any in-frame stop codons (TAG, TGA, TAA). So every three nucleotides should be a codon.

Let me go through the sequence in triplets. Starting from the beginning:

ATG - methionine, start codon.
TAC - tyrosine
CC - wait, no, I should take every three. Let me split the sequence into codons.

1. ATG (start)
2. TAC (Y)
3. CCA (Pro)
4. TAC (Y)
5. GAT (D)
6. GTT (Val)
7. CCA (Pro)
8. GAA (Glu)
9. GGC (Gly)
10. TCC (Ser)
11. GCG (Ala)
12. CCG (Pro)
13. GGA (Gly)
14. AGA (Arg)
15. AGT (Ser)
16. CCG (Pro)
17. CGG (Arg)
18. CAG (Gln)
19. GGT (Gly)
20. CAC (His)
21. AGT (Ser)
22. CCA (Pro)
23. GAC (Asp)
24. TGG (Trp)
25. TCC (Ser)
26. CGC (Arg)
27. CAG (Gln)
28. CTG (Leu)
29. CAG (Gln)
30. GGT (Gly)
31. ACC (Thr)
32. TGG (Trp)
33. GCC (Ala)
34. AGG (Arg)
35. CTG (Leu)
36. CAG (Gln)
37. GAC (Asp)
38. GGT (Gly)
39. CGC (Arg)

55. CGG (Arg)
56. CCG (Pro)
57. GGA (Gly)

65. GGC (Gly)
66. CGC (Arg)
67. TGA (stop codon!)

Oh wait, at position 65-67: TGA is a stop codon. So the sequence has a TGA in the middle, which would cause the ribosome to terminate translation early. That would mean the protein is truncated, and maybe not expressed at detectable levels because it's not the full length.

But why would that happen? Let me think about the context. The construct includes an N-terminal HA tag. Did the introduced HA tag sequence have a premature stop codon? Or perhaps during cloning, an additional stop codon was introduced in frame.

Looking back, the HA tag is at the N-terminus, so it should be the first part of the coding sequence. The HA tag is a small peptide, so maybe the HA sequence doesn't include a stop codon, but in the provided sequence, the stop codon occurs much later.

Alternatively, maybe during the insertion of the HA tag, a stop codon was inadvertently introduced. Or perhaps a mutation occurred during PCR or cloning which added a stop codon.

Wait, the question says the researcher introduced the HA tag at the N-terminus. So the start of the coding sequence is the HA tag, followed by GADD45G. If the provided sequence is the coding sequence (including the HA tag), then the presence of TGA in the middle would cause the protein to terminate early, resulting in a truncated protein that might not be detected by Western blot, or might be unstable.

If the HA sequence is correct, then the TGA must be a premature stop codon in the GADD45G part. Alternatively, perhaps the cloning introduced a stop codon. Let's look at the sequence again.

Wait, the provided sequence is the coding strand, so the mRNA would be complementary to this. So, let's see if there's a TGA in the coding sequence. Oh yes, at positions 65-6
