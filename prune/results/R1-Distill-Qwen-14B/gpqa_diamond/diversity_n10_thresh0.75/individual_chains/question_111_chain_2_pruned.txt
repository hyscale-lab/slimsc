Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The problem says: Complete the following reactions and select the major products by considering steric hindrance and the stability of the products.

The reactions are:

1. 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (with t-BuOK) → A
2. 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H2O) → B

There are four options, A to D, each giving possible products A and B.

My goal is to figure out which option is correct, so I need to analyze each reaction separately.

Starting with Reaction 1: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one reacting with ethyl acrylate in the presence of t-BuOK. Hmm. t-BuOK is a strong, bulky base, so I think this is a Michael addition reaction or perhaps a Claisen condensation. Wait, no, ethyl acrylate is an alpha, beta-unsaturated ester, so it's a good Michael acceptor. So the cyclohexanone would act as the nucleophile (the enolate), attacking the alpha,beta-unsaturated ester.

Wait, but 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one is the starting material. Let me draw its structure. The cyclohexanone ring has substituents at positions 2, 2 (ethyl), 6 (methyl), and 1 (the ketone). So the positions are:

1: ketone (O)
2: ethyl and methyl (since it's 2-ethyl and 2,6-dimethyl; wait, no. Wait, the name is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. So position 1 is the ketone. Position 2 has an ethyl and a methyl group attached? Wait, cyclohexane is a six-membered ring. Position 1 is the one with the ketone. So position 2 is adjacent to it. So the substituents are:

At position 2: ethyl and methyl?
