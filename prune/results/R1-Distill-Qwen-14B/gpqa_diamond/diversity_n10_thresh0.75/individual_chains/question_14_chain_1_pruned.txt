Okay, so I have this question about ChIP-seq experiments, and I need to figure out the answer. Let's start by recalling what I know about ChIP-seq. ChIP stands for Chromatin Immunoprecipitation. The process involves crosslinking proteins to DNA, fragmenting the DNA, using an antibody to pull down the protein of interest along with the DNA attached to it, and then sequencing those DNA fragments to find binding sites.

The question says that they used PFA-fixed samples with an antibody against the IKAROS transcription factor in human B cells. After doing the usual steps like sequencing and quality control, they found some peaks. But when they used PFA plus DSG fixation, those peaks disappeared. I need to figure out where those disappearing peaks are likely located.

Wait, what's PFA and DSG? I remember that PFA is paraformaldehyde, which is a common crosslinker. It fixes proteins to DNA, making them stick together so they can be pulled down. DSG is disuccinimidoglycoluril, another crosslinker, but it's a longer spacer arm crosslinker. It's often used in combination with PFA to ensure that proteins that are farther apart but still interacting are captured.

So why would peaks disappear when using PFA+DSG? Maybe the original fixation with only PFA wasn't strong enough to crosslink some regions, but the addition of DSG made the crosslinking more thorough. So perhaps the peaks that were found before were due to some artifact or regions that weren't properly fixed with just PFA.

Wait, but the peaks disappeared when using PFA+DSG. That's a bit confusing. Oh, wait. Maybe the initial peaks were artifacts that were fixed with PFA but not with the stronger crosslinking. Or perhaps the peaks that were present with only PFA are not true binding sites but something else.

I remember that transcription factors like IKAROS bind to specific regions, like promoters and enhancers, which are active regulatory regions. But when crosslinking is weaker, maybe some regions are not efficiently pulled down. Alternatively, perhaps some of the peaks found with just PFA are at regions that require more thorough crosslinking to be detected.

Another thought: sometimes during fixation, certain regions are more prone to shearing or not crosslinking properly. For example, repetitive regions or regions with high GC content might have issues. But I'm not sure if that's the case here.

Wait, another angle. When you have PFA alone, maybe some DNA regions are sheared more, leading to smaller fragments. When you add DSG, the crosslinking is more efficient, so maybe it's pulling down regions that are more tightly bound but were not captured before. Or maybe it's the oppositeâ€”some regions that are only weakly crosslinked with PFA are lost when DSG is added.

Alternatively, perhaps using PFA+DSG leads to more efficient crosslinking, making the ChIP more stringent. So, maybe the initial peaks were false positives, perhaps at regions that aren't true binding sites but were crosslinked in a way that made them appear as peaks. When the crosslinking is more thorough, those false peaks disappear because the antibody doesn't bind as efficiently there.

Wait, but the antibody is specific for IKAROS. So why would the peaks disappear? Maybe when cross
