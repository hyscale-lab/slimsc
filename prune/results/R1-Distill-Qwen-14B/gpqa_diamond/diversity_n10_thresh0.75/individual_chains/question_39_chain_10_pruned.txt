Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me see if I can figure it out. Hmm, the question is about finding the value of 'a' in the wave function of a particle. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Wait, and the particles are only found between x=1 and x=3. Oh right, when they measure the position, none are found outside that range, which means the wave function must be zero outside of that interval. Or wait, no, actually, the wave function must have zero probability outside. So the wave function itself isn't necessarily zero, but the probability is.

Wait, but the problem says when measuring, none were found at x<1 and x>3. So that implies that the wave function must be zero beyond those points. Because if the wave function is zero, the probability of finding the particle there is zero. So how does that work with the given wave function?

The wave function given is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Wait, that's a complex function. Oh right, because in quantum mechanics, the wave function can be complex. But for the wave function to be physically valid, it must be square-integrable, meaning the integral of the probability density |ψ|^2 must be finite. Also, the wave function must be zero outside the region where the particle exists. So in this case, for x <1 and x>3, ψ must be zero.

Wait, but the wave function given is (a / sqrt(1+x))
