Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, specifically about a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, rhombohedral... I remember that's one of the seven crystal systems. Right, rhombohedral has all sides equal and all angles equal, but they aren't necessarily 90 degrees, which would make it cubic. So in this case, the angles alpha, beta, gamma are all 30 degrees. Interesting.

The question is about finding the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. Oh wait, interplanar distance is the distance between adjacent planes in a crystal lattice. I think the formula for that is d = a / sqrt(l² + m² + n² - 2lm cos α - 2ln cos β - 2mn cos γ), but wait, not exactly sure. Oh wait, another formula comes to mind: the interplanar distance for a plane (hkl) in a crystal is given by d = a/(sqrt(h² + k² + l² - 2hk cos α - 2hl cos β - 2kl cos γ)) when the unit cell is a rhombohedron. Wait, but I'm not entirely confident about the exact formula. Let me think more carefully.

Wait, actually, for a general rhombohedral system, the interplanar distance d is calculated using the formula d_{hkl} = (a) / [ sqrt( h² + k² + l² - 2hk cos α - 2hl cos β - 2kl cos γ ) ].

Wait, but wait,
