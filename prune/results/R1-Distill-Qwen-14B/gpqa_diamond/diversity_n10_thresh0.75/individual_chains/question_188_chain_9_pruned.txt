Okay, so I've got this crystallography problem here about a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, I remember that rhombohedral structures have all sides equal and all angles equal. Oh wait, right, it's a special case where a = b = c and α = β = γ. So in this problem, the interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstroms. Wait, interatomic distance usually refers to the lattice parameter 'a', right? Because in a cubic system, the distance between atoms along the cube edges is just 'a'. But wait, rhombohedral isn't necessarily cubic, but here a is given as 10 Ang.

The question is about the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. I think the formula for interplanar distance d is d = a / sqrt(h² + k² + l² + ... something with angles). Oh wait, wait, the general formula for interplanar distance in a crystal with lattice parameters a, b, c, and angles α, β, γ is given by the formula:

1/d² = (h²)/(a²) + (k²)/(b²) + (l²)/(c²) - [ 2hk cosβγ ]/(ab) - [ 2hl cosαγ ]/(ac) - [ 2kl cosαβ ]/(bc)

Wait, no, maybe that's more complicated than I remember. Alternatively, I think for a rhombohedral system where a = b = c and all angles equal, like this case, there's a simpler formula.

Oh right, in a rhombohedral system, the formula simplifies because a=b=c and all angles are equal. So the interplanar distance can be calculated using:

d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + (2)(h k + h l + k l) cosθ ) )

Wait, no, wait, maybe I got that mixed up. Alternatively, I think the formula might involve cos(alpha) in some way because the angles are all the same.

Wait, perhaps I should recall that for a general crystal system, the interplanar distance is given by:

d_{hkl} = 1 / sqrt( (h²/a² + k²/b² + l²/c²) - 2hk cosβ/(ab) - 2hl cosγ/(ac) - 2kl cosα/(bc) ) )

But in this case, a = b = c, and α
