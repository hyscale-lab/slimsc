Okay, so I've got this problem about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius 2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity, but let me think through this step by step.

The metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, so this is a two-dimensional metric because it's only in terms of dx and dy. Oh right, because a pseudosphere is a two-dimensional surface in some higher-dimensional space, but the metric here is for the induced geometry on the pseudosphere, I guess.

Wait, pseudospheres are related to hyperbolic geometry, right? Because the pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature. But how does that relate to the metric here?

So, the metric is written in terms of x and y, but I remember that metrics for spaces with constant curvature can often be expressed in standard forms. Let's think about the standard metrics for different geometries.

For a sphere, the metric in 2D would be something like (dr² + r² dθ²)/(1 + k r²)^2 or similar, but I'm not exactly sure. Wait, maybe it's easier to think in terms of the metric components. The given metric is in the form where the coefficient is a function of (x² + y²). Let's see, 4 - x² - y² in the denominator. That looks similar to the metric for a sphere, but with a plus sign, because usually, the sphere would have (a² - r²), where r is the radial coordinate
