Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Hmm, it's about finding the eigenvector of a operator along an arbitrary direction. Let's see, the operator is P, and the direction is n, lying in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. 

Wait, I remember that in quantum mechanics, operators like spin or angular momentum have eigenvectors corresponding to specific eigenvalues, which are their possible measurement outcomes. So, the eigenvector here probably corresponds to the state of the muon's spin along direction n being +ħ/2.

The problem gives me the components of the operator P: Px, Py, Pz. Each is a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2. Oh right, these look familiar as the Pauli matrices multiplied by ħ/2. So P is a vector operator made up of these components. 

The direction n is arbitrary but lies in the x-z plane. So, any direction in the x-z plane can be expressed using angles theta and phi, I think. Wait, phi would be the angle in the x-y plane, but since n is in x-z, maybe phi is 0 or 90 degrees? Or perhaps I should parameterize n in terms of theta only?

Wait, any direction in the x-z plane can be written as a unit vector (n_x, 0, n_z). Because the y-component is zero. So, n is (sinθ, 0, cosθ) maybe? Or perhaps another parametrization. Let me think: if theta is the angle from the z-axis, then yeah, n_x = sinθ cosφ, but in this case, since it's in x-z plane, phi is 0 or pi, perhaps. Wait, no, because if it's in the x-z plane, phi would be either 0 or 180 degrees, depending on direction. But the problem says 'arbitrary' direction, so maybe we need to keep it general. Hmm, but perhaps for the eigenvector, the direction is along (x-z) plane, so the state is a linear combination of the eigenstates of P_x and P_z.

Wait, the operator P is the spin operator. Since the direction is arbitrary, we can write P as the sum of its components along n. So, P = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z. But since n is in x-z plane, n_y=0. So P becomes P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

Wait, the operator P is being considered as a vector operator. So the operator along direction n is P·n = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z. And we're looking for its eigenvectors. So the eigenvalue equation is (P·n) |v> = (ħ/2) |v>, since the eigenvalue is +ħ/2. 

Wait, no, wait. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. So the operator's eigenvalue is the component in the direction of n. So when we measure the spin along n, the result is +ħ/2, so the state is an eigenvector of P·n with eigenvalue +ħ/2.

So, to find the eigenvector, I can construct the matrix for P·n and then find its eigenvectors.

But perhaps there's a smarter way. Since the eigenvalue is known, the eigenvector should be the state aligned with the direction n. Wait, in spin-1/2 systems, the eigenstates of S·n are |+> and |->, which are spin-up and spin-down along n.

So, the eigenvector for eigenvalue +ħ/2 is the spin-up state along n.

In terms of the computational basis (say, |+z> and |−z>), this spin-up state can be written as a combination of |+z> and |−z>. So, how do we express this?

Well, the spin-up state along an arbitrary direction (theta, phi) is given by:

|+> = cos(theta/2)|+z> + e^{i phi} sin(theta/2)|-z>

But wait, since the direction n is in the x-z plane, phi is either 0 or pi. Because the x-z plane doesn't involve the y-component. So phi could be 0 if it's in the positive x and z direction, or pi if it's in the negative x and positive z or something. But the problem says it's arbitrary in the x-z plane, so phi might be non-zero? Hmm, but perhaps the problem doesn't specify, so maybe the answer doesn't depend on phi. Wait, looking at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which would correspond to phi=0. Option B is (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)), but that seems like spherical coordinates, but perhaps it's a different parametrization.

Wait, let's think about the eigenvector again. For a spin-1/2 system, the eigenvectors of S·n can be written as:

|+> = e^{-i phi/2} [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]^T

Wait, maybe I should double-check the standard expression. In the standard basis (|+z>, |−z>), the spin-up state along a direction (theta, phi) is:

|+> = [ e^{-i phi/2} cos(theta/2) ]
       [ e^{i phi/2} sin(theta/2) ]

Wait, I'm not entirely sure about the phase factors. Alternatively, another convention might be used. But perhaps for the purpose of this problem, the phase can be ignored since the options don't include phase factors except option B, which includes e^{i phi}.

But in the problem, the direction is in the x-z plane, which implies that phi is 0 or pi, because the x-z plane corresponds to phi=0. Or maybe not? Let me think again. The direction is arbitrary in x-z, which can be parameterized by theta only, because phi is the angle around the z-axis. So, if the direction is in the x-z plane, phi is 0 or pi, depending on whether it's in the positive x direction or negative x.

But since the problem says "arbitrary", perhaps the answer can't depend on phi, so maybe it's taken as zero. Or perhaps the answer includes a general expression.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which would correspond to phi=0. Option B is (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)), which is a different parametrization. Hmm, but perhaps I'm mixing up the parametrization.

Alternatively, the spin-up state can be written as:

|+> = [ cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) ]

So, the components are cos(theta/2) and e^{i phi} sin(theta/2).

But looking at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which doesn't include the phase. Option B is (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)), which seems off in terms of the angle. Because it's cos(theta) instead of cos(theta/2), and the parameterization is different.

Wait, another approach: the operator P·n is a 2x2 matrix, and we can find the eigenvectors by solving (P·n - (ħ/2) I) |v> = 0.

But given the components:

Px = (ħ/2) [[0,1],[1,0]]
Py = (ħ/2) [[0, -i],[i, 0]]
Pz = (ħ/2) [[1,0],[0,-1]]

So, P·n = (n_x Px) + (n_y Py) + (n_z Pz)

But since n is in x-z plane, n_y=0. So, P·n = n_x (ħ/2) σx + n_z (ħ/2) σz, where σx and σz are Pauli matrices.

Let me write this as (ħ/2) (n_x σx + n_z σz )

We can factor out (ħ/2), so the operator is (ħ/2) (n_x σx + n_z σz )

The eigenvalue equation is (n_x σx + n_z σz ) |v> = (1) |v>, because we're looking for eigenvalue 1 in units of (ħ/2). Wait, no. Wait, the eigenvalue is +ħ/2. So:

(n_x σx + n_z σz ) |v> = (1) |v>

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The eigenvalue for (P·n) is (ħ/2) * (+1). So, the operator equation is (P·n) |v> = (ħ/2) |v>.

Factoring out ħ/2, we have (n_x σx + n_z σz) |v> = |v> .

So, the matrix is M = n_x σx + n_z σz.

We can write σx as [[0,1],[1,0]], σz as [[1,0],[0,-1]].

So, M = n_x [[0,1],[1,0]] + n_z [[1,0],[0,-1]]

M = [[n_z, n_x],[n_x, -n_z]]

Wait, because when you add the matrices, the (1,2) and (2,1) elements are n_x, and the diagonal elements are n_z and -n_z.

Wait, no, maybe I should compute it step by step.

M = n_x * [[0,1],[1,0]] + n_z * [[1,0],[0,-1]]

Which gives:

M = [ [n_z * 1 + 0, n_x *1 + 0 ], 
       [n_x *1 + 0, 0 + (-n_z)*1 ] ]

So M = [[n_z, n_x],[n_x, -n_z]]

Now, to find the eigenvectors of M with eigenvalue 1.

So, (M - I) |v> = 0.

M - I = [[n_z -1, n_x],[n_x, -n_z -1]]

The matrix equation is:

(n_z -1) v1 + n_x v2 = 0
n_x v1 + (-n_z -1) v2 = 0

So, from the first equation: (n_z -1) v1 = -n_x v2 => v1 = [ -n_x/(n_z -1) ] v2.

But perhaps we can find the ratio v1/v2.

Let me denote v = [v1; v2]. Let's assume v2 is not zero, so we can write v1 = k v2.

From the first equation: (n_z -1) k v2 + n_x v2 = 0 => (n_z -1) k + n_x =0 => k = -n_x/(n_z -1).

Wait, but if n_z -1 is zero, then we have a different case. Let's assume (n_z -1) ≠ 0 for now.

So, the ratio k = v1/v2 = -n_x/(n_z -1)

Alternatively, v1 = [ -n_x/(n_z -1) ] v2.

Now, substituting into the second equation:

n_x v1 + (-n_z -1) v2 = 0

n_x [ (-n_x)/(n_z -1) v2 ] + ( -n_z -1 ) v2 =0

Factor out v2:

n_x [ (-n_x)/(n_z -1) ) + ( -n_z -1 ) ] = 0

Wait, but this is getting a bit complicated. Maybe it's better to consider that the eigenvectors are in the ratio v1 : v2 = [n_x : (1 - n_z)].

Wait, from the first equation: (n_z -1) v1 + n_x v2 =0 → (n_z -1) v1 = -n_x v2 → v1 / v2 = -n_x/(n_z -1) = n_x/(1 - n_z)

So, the ratio is v1 : v2 = n_x : (1 - n_z )

So, the eigenvector can be written as [n_x; (1 - n_z ) ] multiplied by a normalization factor.

Wait, but n is a unit vector in the x-z plane. So, n_x² + n_z² =1.

So, the vector [n_x, 1 - n_z ] has components that depend on n_x and n_z. But we need to normalize it.

Wait, but perhaps the eigenvector can be expressed in terms of the angles theta and phi. Since n is in the x-z plane, let's parameterize it.

n_x = sin(theta), n_z = cos(theta), perhaps? Or maybe n_x = cos(theta), n_z = sin(theta)? Wait, no, because in spherical coordinates, theta is the polar angle from the z-axis. So, n_x would be sin(theta) cos(phi), but since phi=0 (as it's in the x-z plane), cos(phi)=1, so n_x = sin(theta), n_z = cos(theta).

Wait, yes, that makes sense. So, for a unit vector in the x-z plane, phi=0. So, n = (sin(theta), 0, cos(theta)).

So, n_x = sin(theta), n_z = cos(theta).

So, the eigenvector's components v1 and v2 are in the ratio v1/v2 = n_x / (1 - n_z ) = [ sin(theta) ] / [ 1 - cos(theta) ].

Simplify [1 - cos(theta)] in the denominator. We can use the identity 1 - cos(theta) = 2 sin²(theta/2), and sin(theta) = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2).

So, sin(theta)/(1 - cos(theta)) = [2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) ] / [2 sin²(theta/2) ) ] = cot(theta/2) = [cos(theta/2) ] / [ sin(theta/2) ]

So, v1/v2 = [ cos(theta/2) ] / [ sin(theta/2) ] → v1 = [ cos(theta/2) / sin(theta/2) ] v2 → v1 = cot(theta/2) v2.

But in terms of components, let's write the eigenvector as [v1; v2 ] = [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ] multiplied by a normalization factor. Wait, because [v1; v2 ] = [ (cos(theta/2)/ sin(theta/2) ) v2; v2 ].

Let me factor out v2: [ v1; v2 ] = v2 [ cos(theta/2)/ sin(theta/2), 1 ]

= v2 [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ] / sin(theta/2)

Wait, no. Let me think again. If v1 = ( cos(theta/2) / sin(theta/2) ) v2, then:

v1 = cos(theta/2) / sin(theta/2) * v2

So, the vector is [ cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2) * v2, v2 ].

= v2 [ cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2), 1 ]

Factor out 1/sin(theta/2):

= v2 / sin(theta/2) [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]

So, as a vector, it's proportional to [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

But we need to normalize it. The normalization requires that |v1|^2 + |v2|^2 =1.

So, let's compute the normalization factor.

Let me let the vector be [ a, b ] where a= cos(theta/2), b= sin(theta/2).

But wait, cos(theta/2)^2 + sin(theta/2)^2 =1, so the vector [a, b] is already normalized.

Wait, but in our case, the vector is [v1; v2] = [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ] multiplied by something? Wait, no. Wait, in our earlier step, the ratio was v1 = (n_x)/(1 -n_z) v2.

But substituting n_x = sin(theta), n_z=cos(theta), so 1 - n_z=1 - cos(theta)=2 sin^2(theta/2).

So, the ratio v1/v2 = [ sin(theta) ] / [ 2 sin²(theta/2) ) ] = [ 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) ] / [ 2 sin²(theta/2) ) ] = [ cos(theta/2) ] / [ sin(theta/2) ]

So, v1 = [ cos(theta/2) / sin(theta/2) ] v2 → let v2= sin(theta/2), then v1= cos(theta/2).

So, the vector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Wait, but wait, in the earlier step, [v1; v2] is proportional to [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

So, the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

But looking at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Option B is (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)), which seems to have a different parametrization. Also, the other options involve ħ, which isn't in the state vectors because they're normalized and the units are abstracted away.

Wait, but wait, the options have some terms with ħ. Option A and D have hbar. But in quantum states, the components are dimensionless, so the presence of ħ in options A and D seems odd. So perhaps options A and D can be dismissed.

So, among the options, B, C, D.

Wait, but the eigenvector is a two-component vector. Let's look back at the options:

Option C: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

So the components are real, which makes sense if the state is real. But in reality, for spin-1/2 systems, the state can have phase factors, especially when considering different directions. But if the direction is in the x-z plane (phi=0), then the eigenvector should be real.

Wait, but wait. When phi=0, then the spin-up state is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]^T, which is option C. So, if the direction is in x-z (phi=0), the eigenvector is real. But the problem states the direction is arbitrary in x-z plane, which might allow phi to be non-zero. Wait, no, because in the x-z plane, phi=0 or pi. So, for example, if n is in the x-z plane but in the negative x direction, phi would be pi. So, does that affect the eigenvector?

Wait, let's think about that. If phi is pi, then e^{i phi} would be -1. So, for phi=pi, the state would be [ cos(theta/2), - sin(theta/2) ]^T. But would that be the case? Let me think.

Wait, the general spin-up state is |+> = [ cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) ]^T.

So, if phi is zero, you get the real vector. If phi is pi, then e^{i pi} = -1, so the vector becomes [ cos(theta/2), - sin(theta/2) ]^T.

But for arbitrary phi in the x-z plane, phi would be zero or pi. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the x-z plane is spanned by x and z, so any point in the x-z plane has y=0, but the angle phi in spherical coordinates is measured in the x-y plane. So, phi could be zero (along positive x-axis) or pi (along negative x-axis).

Wait, but in the problem statement, the direction is arbitrary in the x-z plane. So the eigenvector's components will have a phase factor of e^{i phi}.

Looking back at the options:

Option B: (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)).

Wait, that's written as (cos theta, e^{i phi} sin theta), which is a different parametrization than what we have. Because our parametrization is (cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2)).

So, option B's components are cos theta and e^{i phi} sin theta. That doesn't match.

Option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which is real if phi=0. But if phi is non-zero, that's only the case when phi=0.

But the problem states that the direction is arbitrary in x-z, so the eigenvector should account for phi.

Wait, so perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Because if the direction is arbitrary in x-z, phi could be anything, but in reality, when n is in the x-z plane, phi is either 0 or pi. So, perhaps the correct parametrization should involve phi=0, making the eigenvector real.

Wait, but the spin-up state for arbitrary direction (theta, phi) is [ e^{-i phi/2} cos(theta/2), e^{i phi/2} sin(theta/2) ].

Wait, that's another way to write it. So when phi=0, it's [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

But if the direction is arbitrary in the x-z plane, then phi is fixed, say, 0. So perhaps the eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

But looking at the options, option C matches that.

Hmm, but why is option B an option then? Option B is (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)).

Wait, maybe I should consider the parametrization differently. Because sometimes in physics, the direction is parametrized with angles alpha and beta, but perhaps the question expects a different approach.

Wait, another approach: The operator P·n has eigenstates that are the same as the eigenstates of the Pauli matrices along n. So, the eigenstates can be written in terms of the spherical harmonics or the Bloch sphere.

So, the state |+> is the spin-up state, which can be written as:

|+> = [ e^{-i phi/2} cos(theta/2) ]
          [ e^{i phi/2} sin(theta/2) ]

Which, when phi=0, becomes [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

So, the components are cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2), which is option C.

But in the problem, the eigenvector is along an arbitrary direction in the x-z plane. So, the arbitrary direction could have phi=0, making the eigenvector real. Alternatively, if phi is not zero, the second component would have a phase factor.

But looking at the options, only option B includes a phase factor. So, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the parametrization. Let me think again.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me consider the problem again.

The operator P·n has eigenvalue +ħ/2, so the eigenvector must be the spin-up state along direction n.

The spin-up state in the basis of S_z (computational basis) is:

|+> = [ cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) ]

So, the components are [ cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) ].

Now, looking at the options:

Option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Option B is (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)).

Hmm, none of the options exactly match [ cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) ].

Wait, option B's components are cos(theta) and e^{i phi} sin(theta), which is double the angle. So maybe it's using a different parametrization.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the direction vector. Let me consider that the direction n is given by angles theta and phi, where theta is the polar angle and phi the azimuthal.

So, for a direction in the x-z plane, phi=0, then the state would be [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

But if the direction is in x-z, then theta can vary, but phi is 0 or pi.

Wait, perhaps the eigenvector components can be written as (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which is option C.

But looking at the other options, option D is [ sqrt(2/3) hbar cos(theta/2), sqrt(1/3) hbar sin(theta/2) ].

Wait, why is there a sqrt(2/3) and sqrt(1/3) in option D? That would suggest that the eigenvector is not normalized, unless those factors come from some other normalization.

Wait, but the problem says the eigenvector should be normalized. So, the components should satisfy |a|^2 + |b|^2 =1.

In option C, cos^2(theta/2) + sin^2(theta/2) =1, so it's normalized. So that's okay.

But what about the other options? Option A has hbar, which doesn't make sense in a normalized state. Same with D.

So, perhaps the correct answer is option C.

But wait, earlier when solving the matrix equation, I found that the ratio v1/v2 is n_x/(1 -n_z).

Which, using n_x = sin(theta), n_z=cos(theta), gives v1/v2 = [ sin(theta) ] / [1 - cos(theta) ]

But 1 - cos(theta) = 2 sin^2(theta/2), and sin(theta) = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2).

So, v1/v2 = [2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) ] / [ 2 sin^2(theta/2) ] ] = cot(theta/2) = cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2)

So, v1 = [ cos(theta/2)/ sin(theta/2) ] v2.

So, if I let v2 = sin(theta/2), then v1 = cos(theta/2).

So, the vector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ], which is option C.

So, it's looking like option C is the correct answer.


To solve the problem, we are tasked with finding the normalized eigenvector of the operator $\vec{P}$ along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ lying in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The operator $\vec{P}$ is defined in terms of its components $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$, which are proportional to the Pauli matrices. The direction $\vec{n}$ is in the x-z plane, so it can be parameterized as $\vec{n} = (\sin\theta, 0, \cos\theta)$, where $\theta$ is the polar angle from the z-axis.

The operator along $\vec{n}$ is given by $\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = n_x P_x + n_z P_z$. Substituting $n_x = \sin\theta$ and $n_z = \cos\theta$, the matrix representation of $\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n}$ becomes:

\[
\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvalue equation is:

\[
\left( \vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} - \frac{\hbar}{2} I \right) |v\rangle = 0,
\]

where $I$ is the identity matrix. Factoring out $\hbar/2$, the eigenvalue equation simplifies to:

\[
\begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta - 1 & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta - 1 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} v_1 \\ v_2 \end{bmatrix} = 0.
\]

From the first row of the matrix equation, we find the ratio of the components of the eigenvector:

\[
v_1 / v_2 = \frac{\sin\theta}{1 - \cos\theta}.
\]

Using trigonometric identities, $1 - \cos\theta = 2\sin^2(\theta/2)$ and $\sin\theta = 2\sin(\theta/2)\cos(\theta/2)$, the ratio simplifies to:

\[
v_1 / v_2 = \frac{\cos(\theta/2)}{\sin(\theta/2)} = \cot(\theta/2).
\]

Thus, the eigenvector can be written as:

\[
|v\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} \cos(\theta/2) \\ \sin(\theta/2) \end{bmatrix}.
\]

To normalize the eigenvector, we note that $\cos^2(\theta/2) + \sin^2(\theta/2) = 1$, so the vector is already normalized.

### Analysis of the Options:
1. **Option A**: $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar, \sqrt{1/3}\hbar)$  
   This includes $\hbar$, which is not appropriate for a normalized eigenvector. Hence, this option is incorrect.

2. **Option B**: $(\cos\theta, e^{i\phi}\sin\theta)$  
   This uses a different parametrization where the components are proportional to $\cos\theta$ and $\sin\theta$, not $\cos(\theta/2)$ and $\sin(\theta/2)$. This does not match the derived eigenvector.

3. **Option C**: $(\cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2))$  
   This matches the derived eigenvector exactly and is normalized. This is the correct answer.

4. **Option D**: $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar \cos(\theta/2), \sqrt{1/3}\hbar \sin(\theta/2))$  
   This includes unnecessary normalization factors and $\hbar$, which is not appropriate for a normalized eigenvector. Hence, this option is incorrect.

### Final Answer:
The normalized eigenvector is $(\cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2))$, which corresponds to **Option C**.

Answer: C
