Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it says. 

The question is about two electrons in p orbital angular momentum states. We're told to ignore their spin angular momentum. The coupled angular momentum state is given as |l₁, l₂, l, m> = |1,1,2,-1>. So, l₁ and l₂ are both 1, which makes sense for p orbitals. The total angular momentum quantum numbers are l=2 and m=-1.

The question asks about the joint probability of measuring both L₁z and L₂z to be -ħ each. So, I need to find the probability that when I measure the z-components of each electron's orbital angular momentum, both are -ħ.

Wait, electrons have angular momentum quantum numbers. For each, Lz is ml * ħ. So, for each electron, if m is -1, then Lz is -ħ. But wait, since each electron is in a p orbital, ml can be -1, 0, or +1. But in this coupled state, the total m is -1, but what about the individual m's?

So, the state is |1,1,2,-1>. I think this represents the combination of the two individual angular momenta. The total angular momentum is the sum of the two individual ones. So, the state is a combination of all possible ways to add l₁ and l₂ to get l=2 and m=-1.

Let me think about how these states combine. Since l₁ and l₂ are both 1, their possible total l values range from 0 to 2. So, the state here is the highest possible l, which is 2. And the m is -1, which is less than the maximum possible m of 2 (since 1+1=2).

Wait, but how are the states |l₁, l₂, l, m> constructed? They are coupled states, meaning they're eigenstates of the total angular momentum squared (L²) and its z-component (Lz). The state |1,1,2,-1> is an eigenstate of L² with eigenvalue ħ² l(l+1) = 2*3 ħ² = 6 ħ², and of Lz with eigenvalue m ħ = -
