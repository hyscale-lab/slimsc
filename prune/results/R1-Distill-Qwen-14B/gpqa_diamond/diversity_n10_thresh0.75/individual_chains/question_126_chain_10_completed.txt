Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, the question involves two reactions and then analyzing the products using HPLC. I remember that HPLC can separate compounds based on their interaction with the stationary phase. 

First, let's look at Reaction I. The starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. It's treated with LAH followed by an acidic workup. LAH is a strong reducing agent, usually used for ketones. So, the ketone group in hexan-3-one should be reduced. Hexan-3-one is a six-carbon chain with a ketone on the third carbon. When reduced, the ketone becomes a secondary alcohol. So the product would be (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. Wait, but wait, because the starting material is (S) configuration. When you reduce a ketone to an alcohol, does the stereochemistry change? I think ketones are planar, so the reduction can lead to either R or S configuration. Wait, but in this case, since the starting material is an (S) configuration at the 5-position (the methoxy group is on C5), but when we reduce the ketone, that's at C3. So the configuration on C3 might be formed from the reduction. Wait, no, the methoxy is on C5, and the ketone is at C3. So when we reduce the ketone at C3, we will form an alcohol at C3. Since LAH is a strong reducing agent, it will reduce ketones to secondary alcohols. So the product of Reaction I is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. But wait, wait, no. The starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one, which I think is the configuration at C3? Or C5? Wait, the numbering is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So the structure is:

CH2-CH2-C(O)-CH(OCH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, hexan-3-one is CH2CH2(CO)CH2CH2CH3? No, hexan-3-one is CH2CH2-CO-CH2CH2CH3 but that's not correct. Let me draw it. Hexan-3-one is CH3CH2COCH2CH2CH3? Wait no, hexan-3-one would be CH2CH2-CO-CH2CH2CH3? Wait, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong. Hexan-3-one has the structure as:

CH2CH2-CO-CH2CH2CH3? Or maybe CH2CH2-CO-CH2CH2CH3? Wait, hexan-3-one is (CH2)2CO(CH2)3CH3. So the carbonyl is on carbon 3, with two CH2 groups on either side. So the structure is CH2CH2-CO-CH2CH2CH3. But wait, the substituents on the carbonyl are two CH2 groups and a methyl? No, wait, hexan-3-one is CH2CH2-CO-CH2CH2CH3? Hmm, perhaps it's (CH2)2CO(CH2)3CH3. So the molecule is:

CH2CH2-CO-CH2CH2CH3. But wait, the starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So the 5th carbon has a methoxy group. So the structure is:

CH2-CH2-CO-CH(OCH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, no, hexan-3-one is six carbons in a row, with the ketone on C3. So positions 1, 2, 3 (CO), 4, 5, 6. So the structure is CH2CH2-CO-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2CH3? Wait, no. Let me number from the CO group. Then:

1: CH2CH2-CO-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2-CH3? No, wait, maybe I should count from the end. Let me think: the molecule is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So the carbonyl is on C3, and the substituents are as follows:

C1: CH3
C2: CH2
C3: CO
C4: CH2
C5: OCH3 attached to C5 (so a CH(OCH3))
C6: probably a CH3? No, wait, hexan-3-one is six carbons, so:

Positions:

1: CH3
2: CH2
3: CO
4: CH2
5: CH2-OCH3?
Wait, no, the structure of 5-methoxyhexan-3-one would be:

CH2CH2-CO-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think of the structure as:

CH2CH2-CO-CH(OCH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, maybe I'm not getting this right. Alternatively, perhaps it's:

CH2-CH2-CO-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2CH3? No, that would make seven carbons. Wait, hexan-3-one is six carbons. So positions 1 to 6. The CO is on position 3. So:

1: CH3
2: CH2
3: CO
4: CH2
5: CH(OCH3)
6: CH3? No, wait, that would make it 5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So the structure is (CH2)2COCH(OCH3)CH2CH3? So:

Positions:
1: CH2
2: CH2
3: CO
4: CH
5: OCH3 attached to it
6: CH2CH3? Wait, no, perhaps more accurately, it's:

CH2CH2-CO-CH(OCH3)-CH2-CH3. So the carbonyl is at C3, and the OCH3 is at C5. When you reduce this with LAH, the ketone (C3) becomes a secondary alcohol, so the product is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. Wait, but the starting material's configuration is (S) at C5. So after reduction, the alcohol is at C3. Does the configuration at C5 change? No, because the reduction is at C3. So the product is 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, with configuration S at C5 and whatever at C3. Wait, when you reduce a ketone with LAH, the alcohol formed will have the same configuration as the starting material? Or will it be racemic? Wait, no. LAH is a strong reducing agent and typically reduces ketones to secondary alcohols without any stereochemistry because the ketone is planar. So when you have a planar carbonyl, the addition can happen from either face, leading to a racemic mixture. But wait, the starting material is an (S) configuration at C5. But the reduction is at C3. So the configuration at C3, which is the site of reduction, will determine the configuration of the resulting alcohol. Wait, no, because the starting material is a ketone, which is planar at C3. So the attack can happen from either side, leading to racemic formation. Wait, but wait: the starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. The S configuration is at C5. So the C3 position is a carbonyl, which is sp2 hybridized. When reduced, it becomes an sp3 hybridized alcohol. So the attack by hydride could be from either face, leading to R and S configurations at C3. So the product of reaction I would be a racemic mixture of 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. Wait, but the starting material is enantiomerically pure (S) configuration at C5. So the product would have a new stereocenter at C3, but it would be racemic. So when you run the product on a chiral HPLC, it would show two peaks, one for each enantiomer. But wait, noâ€”wait, if the reaction leads to a racemic mixture, then you have two enantiomers, which would be separated by a chiral HPLC. But wait, what about the configuration at C5? It was S in the starting material, and does it change? No, because the reaction is at C3. So the product would have two stereocenters: C3 and C5. C5 remains S, and C3 is a new stereocenter that is racemic.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. The starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So the structure is:

CH2CH2-CO-CH(OCH3)-CH2CH3. Wait, no. Wait, 5-methoxyhexan-3-one would be:

CH2CH2-CO-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2CH3. No, but that's seven carbons. Wait, wait. Oh, wait, hexan has six carbons. So hexan-3-one is:

CH2CH2-CO-CH2CH2CH3. But with a methoxy group on carbon 5. So, numbering from the ketone:

1: CH2CH2-
Wait, maybe it's better to write it as:

CH2CH2-CO-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2. Hmm, but that doesn't add up correctly. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

CH2CH2-CO-CH(OCH3)-CH2CH2CH3? No, but that's seven carbons. Maybe I'm getting stuck on the structure. Let me move on and come back if needed.

Reaction I: Reducing the ketone to an alcohol. So product is 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, which has two stereocenters: the original at C5 (S configuration) and the new one at C3 (racemic). So the product is a mixture of two diastereomers? Wait, no. The C3 is a new stereocenter and will have R and S configurations. So the product will be a racemic mixture of 3-alcohol, with C5 being S. So each enantiomer at C3 will be present, but C5 remains S. So the product is a racemic mixture of 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. Each molecule has the S configuration at C5, but R/S at C3. So the product is a 50:50 mix of (S,S) and (S,R) configurations? No, wait, the C3 is the new stereocenter. So the product is a racemic mixture of diastereomers. Wait, no: the C5 is already an S configuration, so the C3's configuration is independent. So the product would be two enantiomers: one where C3 is R and one where it's S. So each of these would have the same configuration at C5 (S). So when run on a chiral HPLC, each enantiomer would elute as a separate peak. So Reaction I gives two stereoisomers: (S,R) and (S,S) at C5 and C3? Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The key point is that Reaction I produces two enantiomers at C3, so two peaks on chiral HPLC.

Now, Reaction II: Pentane-2,4-dione treated with excess NaBH4 followed by acidic workup. Pentane-2,4-dione is (CH3CO)2CH2? No, wait, pentane-2,4-dione is O=C-CH2-CO-CH2-CH3? No, wait, pentane has five carbons. So pentane-2,4-dione is (CH3)C(O)CH2C(O)CH3? No, wait, let me think: for pentane, five carbons. 2,4-dione would have ketone groups on C2 and C4. So the structure is O=C-CH2-CO-CH2-CH3? No, wait, that's six. Maybe O=C-CH2-CO-CH2? No. Maybe it's O=C-CH2-CO-CH2-CH3? No, that's six carbons. Oh wait, no: pentane is five carbons. So positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. So 2,4-dione would be:

O=C-CH2-CO-CH2- ?

Wait, perhaps it's O=C-CH2-CO-CH2-CH3? No, that would be six. Hmm, maybe I should think of it as:

O=C-CH2-CO-CH2-CH3, but that's six carbons. Oh wait, no. Wait, perhaps it's:

O=C-CH2-CO-CH2-CH3 is actually hexane-2,4-dione, but for pentane, it's O=C-CH2-CO-CH2-CH2. No, that's not possible. Alternatively, maybe it's O=C-CH2-CO-CH2-CH3, but that's six carbons. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong, but that might not matter as much for the reaction. The main point is that pentane-2,4-dione is a diketone, with two ketone groups. When treated with NaBH4 in excess, which is a strong reducing agent, each ketone group would be reduced. NaBH4 typically doesn't reduce esters or amides, but ketones are okay. So each ketone group in pentane-2,4-dione would be reduced to secondary alcohols. So the product would be pentane-2,4-diol. So, the structure would be HO-CH2-CHOH-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, pentane-2,4-diol would have OH groups on C2 and C4. So the structure is:

CH2(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-CH3. No, wait, that's five carbons. So the structure is: HOCH2CH2CH(OH)CH2CH3. Wait, no. Let me think again. Pentane-2,4-dione is:

O=C-CH2-CO-CH2-CH3. Wait, no, that's five carbons? Let me count: O=C-CH2-CO-CH2-CH3 is six carbons. Hmm, perhaps the correct structure is O=C-CH2-CO-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, that's seven. Maybe I should give up on the structure and think about the product. The product of pentane-2,4-dione reduction would be 2,4-pentanediol. So each ketone group becomes a secondary alcohol. So the product is (HOCH2)2CHCH2CH3? Wait, no, the structure would be HOCH2CH2CH(OH)CH2CH3? No, that's five carbons with OH on 2 and 4.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is:

CH2(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-CH3.

But regardless, the key point is that both ketones are reduced to secondary alcohols, leading to a 1,2,4-triol? Or perhaps I'm mixing up the positions. Alternatively, maybe the product is a vicinal diol, but with two separate alcohols. Wait, no, the starting material is a diketone, so each ketone is on adjacent carbons? No, pentane-2,4-dione would have two ketones separated by a CH2 group. So the structure is: 

O=C-CH2-CH2-CO-CH3? No, that's not correct. Wait, maybe it's O=C-CH2-CO-CH2-CH3, but that's five carbons. Wait, no, let's think: pentane is five carbons. So positions 1,2,3,4,5. So 2 and 4 are the ketone positions. So structure is O=C-CH2-CO-CH2-CH3? No, that would be six. Oh wait, perhaps it's O=C-CH2-CO-CH2-CH2-CH3, but that's six carbons. Hmm, maybe the structure is O=C-CH2-CO-CH2-CH2-CH3, but that's not pentane. I'm getting stuck, but perhaps I can proceed.

In any case, when NaBH4 is used in excess, both ketones are reduced. So the product will have two secondary alcohol groups. So the product is 2,4-pentanediol. Now, the question is whether this product has any stereocenters. Let's think: the reduction of each ketone. Each ketone is at C2 and C4. Upon reduction, each becomes a secondary alcohol. But the configuration at each site? Since the starting ketone is planar, the reduction can lead to either R or S configuration at each center.

Wait, but for each ketone, when reduced, the product would be a racemic mixture. So for each ketone, you get a 50:50 mixture of R and S. But since there are two ketones, and each is independently reduced, the overall product would be a mixture of four diastereomers. Let's see:

Each ketone can be reduced to R or S configuration. So for two ketones, you have 2^2 = 4 possibilities: RR, RS, SR, SS. Wait, no, because each ketone is on a different carbon, so the configuration would be independent. So the product would be a mixture of four diastereomers. For example, if the two alcohols are both R, or both S, or one R and the other S, leading to four stereoisomers. Because each stereocenter is independent, you get four possible stereoisomers. 

Wait, but wait a second. If the two alcohols are on adjacent carbons, perhaps there's some kind of stereochemistry that makes some of them identical. Wait, no, because each is on a different carbon. So each could have R or S configuration independently. So four stereoisomers in total. 

But wait, when you reduce a diketone, are the two reductions independent? So each ketone is treated separately, leading to four possible stereoisomers. So the product from Reaction II is a mixture of four stereoisomers. When you run this on a chiral HPLC, each stereoisomer would be a separate peak. So four peaks on chiral HPLC.

Wait, but wait another point: the reaction uses excess NaBH4. Does this affect the outcome? Well, excess reducing agent would drive the reaction to completion, but in terms of stereochemistry, it doesn't change anything. So the product is a racemic mixture for each reduction, leading to four diastereomers.

Now, let's look at the products.

Reaction I: two stereoisomers (racemic mixture at C3, C5 is fixed as S).

So products from Reaction I: two diastereomers, each a pair of enantiomers. Wait, no. Wait, no, in Reaction I, the product is a racemic mixture of two enantiomers. Because the starting material is (S) at C5, and the C3 is new, leading to two enantiomers. So when you have a racemic mixture, each enantiomer is present in equal amounts, and each would be a separate peak on a chiral HPLC. So Reaction I gives two peaks on chiral HPLC.

Reaction II: four stereoisomers. Each would be a separate peak on chiral HPLC, so four peaks.

When the two products are combined, the total number of stereoisomers is 2 (from I) + 4 (from II) = 6? But wait, no, because perhaps some are the same. Wait, the products from Reaction I are 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol with two stereocenters (C3 and C5), and Reaction II is 2,4-pentanediol with two stereocenters (C2 and C4). These are structurally different compounds. So when combined, all six stereoisomers are present. But wait, no, because Reaction I's product and Reaction II's product are different molecules, so their stereoisomers don't interfere. So when combined, you have 2 + 4 = 6 stereoisomers.

But wait, the question says that after the reactions are 100% completed, the products are combined and run on both a normal-phase HPLC and a chiral HPLC. So the number of peaks in each would depend on how many distinct compounds are present.

Wait, wait a minute. Let me think again. Reaction I yields two stereoisomers, and Reaction II yields four. When combined, that's 2 +4 =6 compounds. But wait, no, because for each reaction, the product is a racemic mixture or a mixture of diastereomers. So the samples are combined, meaning that each product's mixture is in the same solution. So the peaks would be additive.

But what about the normal-phase HPLC? Normal-phase HPLC separates based on polarity, so compounds with different polarities would elute at different times. So how many distinct compounds are present in the combined product?

Let's think about the structures.

Reaction I product: 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. Structure: (CH2)2CH(OH)CH(OCH3)(CH2)CH3. Wait, no, perhaps it's (CH2)2COH-CH(OCH3)-CH2CH3. So it's a six-carbon alcohol with a methoxy group on C5 and an OH on C3. The product is a racemic mixture, so two diastereomers (each with two stereocenters: C3 and C5). 

Reaction II product: 2,4-pentanediol. Structure: HOCH2CH2CH(OH)CH2CH3. So it's a five-carbon diol with OH groups on C2 and C4. The product is a mixture of four stereoisomers (each with two stereocenters: C2 and C4).

So when these two products are combined, how many distinct compounds are there? Each product is a distinct molecule, so the total number of distinct compounds is 2 (from I) +4 (from II) =6. So in normal-phase HPLC, each compound would have a distinct retention time, assuming they have different polarities. So six peaks in normal-phase HPLC.

But wait, the options don't have six as an option. Let me check the options again.

Options are:

A) 5 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC

B) 3 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC

C) 4 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC

D) 3 peaks in both chiral HPLC and normal-phase HPLC

Hmm, none of the options have 6. So I must have made a mistake in my reasoning.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again.

Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one â†’ LAH â†’ product is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, but the reduction at C3 leads to a racemic mixture. So the product is a racemic mixture of two enantiomers, each with an S configuration at C5 and R/S at C3. So two peaks on chiral HPLC.

Reaction II: pentane-2,4-dione â†’ NaBH4 â†’ 2,4-pentanediol. Each ketone is reduced, so each OH has two possible configurations. So four stereoisomers, each a diastereomer. So four peaks on chiral HPLC.

So when combined, the products from both reactions would give 2+4=6 stereoisomers. However, the question specifies that both reactions are 100% complete. So each reaction goes to full conversion, and the products are collected and combined.

But wait, the products are different molecules: 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and 2,4-pentanediol. So each has their own set of stereoisomers. So when combined, the HPLC would see all the stereoisomers from both compounds.

But looking at the options, the highest number of peaks in the options is 5 in the chiral case. So I must have made an error in the analysis.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the products. Let me think again.

Wait, in Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is treated with LAH. LAH is a strong reducing agent, but can it reduce esters or ethers? Wait, no. Because the starting material has a methoxy group, which is an ether. LAH typically doesn't reduce ethers. So the LAH would only reduce the ketone. So the product is 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, with a new stereocenter at C3. So the product has two stereocenters: C3 (new, racemic) and C5 (original S). So four stereoisomers? No, because C5 is fixed as S. So the product is two stereoisomers: (S,S) and (S,R) at C3 and C5. So when run on a chiral HPLC, each enantiomer would be a separate peak. So two peaks from Reaction I.

Reaction II: pentane-2,4-dione â†’ NaBH4 â†’ 2,4-pentanediol. Each ketone is reduced to an alcohol. Each reduction is a new stereocenter. So four stereoisomers in total. So four peaks on chiral HPLC.

So when combined, the total number of peaks on chiral HPLC would be 2 (from I) +4 (from II) =6. But none of the options have six. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the product from Reaction I is a single enantiomer. Because the starting material is (S)-configured, and the reduction at C3 may lead to a specific configuration? Wait, no. LAH typically reduces ketones to alcohols without any preference for configuration, leading to racemic mixtures. So Reaction I's product is a 50:50 mix of two enantiomers, so two peaks.

Reaction II's product is four stereoisomers, so four peaks.

Combined, 2+4=6 stereoisomers. But the options don't include six. So perhaps I'm making a mistake.

Wait another possibility: maybe in Reaction I, the product is not chiral. No, because C3 and C5 are stereocenters. So two stereocenters, so four possible stereoisomers? No, no, because the starting material is (S) at C5, and the product has C3 as a new stereocenter. So the product would be two stereoisomers: (S,R) and (S,S) at C3 and C5. So two peaks on chiral.

In Reaction II, four stereoisomers, each with two stereocenters.

So in the combined sample, 2 (from I) +4 (from II) =6 stereoisomers. But in the options, the highest is 5. So perhaps I'm mistaken about the number of stereoisomers in each reaction.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps Reaction I produces a compound with only one stereocenter. Wait, no. The product is 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. So C3 is a stereocenter, and C5 has a methoxy group, which is a substituent but not a stereocenter. Wait, is C5 a stereocenter? Let me think: in the starting material, (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one, the C5 has a methoxy group and three other substituents. So C5 is a stereocenter. After reduction, the C3 becomes a stereocenter, but C5 remains a stereocenter with the same configuration (S). So the product has two stereocenters: C3 and C5. So two stereocenters, which would give four possible stereoisomers? No, because C5's configuration is fixed as S in the starting material. Wait, no. The starting material is (S) at C5. After reduction, C3 is a new stereocenter, so the product has two stereocenters: C3 (two possibilities) and C5 (fixed as S). So the product is two stereoisomers, each with C5 S and C3 R or S. So two peaks on chiral HPLC.

Reaction II: each of the two ketones is reduced, leading to two new stereocenters. So four stereoisomers. So when combined, 2 (from I) +4 (from II) =6 stereoisomers. So on chiral HPLC, 6 peaks.

But the options don't have 6. So perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe the products from Reaction I and II are the same. No, they're different compounds.

Alternatively, perhaps in Reaction II, the product is a single stereoisomer because the two OH groups are on adjacent carbons and may form a meso compound. Wait, no. Let me think: if the two OH groups are on adjacent carbons, like HO-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-CH3, would any of the stereoisomers be meso? Well, for a molecule to be meso, it must have an internal plane of symmetry. Let's see: if the configurations are R and S on C2 and C4, respectively, would that make a meso compound?

Wait, let's imagine the structure: HOCH2-CH(OH)-CH2-CH3.

If C2 is R and C4 is S, then the molecule could have a plane of symmetry. Let me imagine:

C2: R (OH on front)
C4: S (OH on back)

Would that make the molecule symmetrical? No, because the substituents around each carbon are different. Alternatively, perhaps if both are R or both S, but that's not meso.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think: for a compound to be meso, it must have two or more stereocenters, but also an internal plane of symmetry. For example, in 2,3-butanediol, if the configurations are R and S, the molecule is meso because there's a plane of symmetry between C2 and C3.

In Reaction II's product, 2,4-pentanediol, the OHs are on C2 and C4. So the structure would be CH2(OH)CH2CH(OH)CH2CH3. Now, let's imagine C2 is R and C4 is S. Would that make the molecule symmetrical? No, because the substituents are not mirror images. Alternatively, maybe when both are R or both are S, it's not meso. So each stereoisomer is distinct, leading to four stereoisomers.

But wait, perhaps in 2,4-pentanediol, the two stereocenters are not adjacent, so no meso forms. So four distinct stereoisomers.

So that brings us back to 2 (from I) +4 (from II) =6 stereoisomers.

But the options don't have this. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the options again. Maybe I'm missing something else. Let's look at the options:

Option C says 4 peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 in normal-phase.

How could that happen? Let me think, perhaps the products from both reactions are the same. But no, they're different molecules.

Alternatively, perhaps one of the reactions doesn't produce stereoisomers. For example, if Reaction I's product is a single compound, not a racemic mix.

Wait, could LAH induce some kind of stereochemistry preference? I thought LAH usually leads to racemic mixtures because the ketone is planar. But perhaps in this case, the starting material's configuration influences the product's configuration.

Wait, the starting material is (S) at C5. The reduction occurs at C3, which is a separate stereocenter. So the configuration at C5 doesn't influence the configuration at C3. So the product is a racemic mix at C3, leading to two stereoisomers.

Alternatively, perhaps the product of Reaction I is a meso compound, meaning that it has an internal plane of symmetry, making it achiral. But that would require that the configuration at C3 and C5 are such that the molecule is symmetrical. Let me think: if C3 is R and C5 is S, but perhaps it's a meso form. Wait, but C3 and C5 are not adjacent. So the molecule would be (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. For it to be a meso compound, there must be a plane of symmetry. Let me imagine the structure: 

CH2-CH2-C(OH)H-CH(OCH3)-CH2-CH3.

Wait, but that's a six-carbon chain. The OH is on C3, and OCH3 on C5. Is there a plane of symmetry? Unlikely, because the positions are not symmetric. So the product would be a pair of enantiomers, leading to two peaks on chiral HPLC.

Wait, but perhaps I'm wrong, and the product of Reaction I is a single enantiomer. How?

Wait, if the starting material is (S) at C5, and the reduction leads to a specific configuration at C3 because of some influence. But I don't think that's the case. LAH typically doesn't take configuration into account for ketone reductions.

So perhaps I'm stuck. Let me think about the number of peaks in the normal-phase HPLC. Each product is a distinct compound, so when combined, there are two distinct compounds (from Reaction I and II). So in normal-phase HPLC, each would have their own retention time. So two peaks. But wait, each product has multiple stereoisomers, but in normal-phase HPLC, all stereoisomers of the same compound would co-elute? No, because normal-phase HPLC separates based on polarity, not based on structure. So for instance, if two stereoisomers have the same polarity, they would co-elute. But in reality, diastereomers have different physical properties, so they would elute at different times. But wait, no, diastereomers can sometimes have similar properties. But for the sake of this question, perhaps each stereoisomer of the same compound would give a separate peak. So for Reaction I, two stereoisomers â†’ two peaks on normal-phase. Reaction II, four stereoisomers â†’ four peaks on normal-phase. So total of 6 peaks. But again, none of the options have six.

Wait, perhaps the normal-phase HPLC is separating based on the molecular structure, not the stereoisomers. So each compound (from I and II) would be a single peak, regardless of stereoisomers. But that can't be right because the question says the products are combined and run on both columns. So each product would have multiple peaks based on their stereoisomers.

Wait, but perhaps the normal-phase HPLC would separate the two compounds (from I and II) into two separate peaks, regardless of their stereoisomers. Because they're structurally different. So each reaction's product would be a single peak in normal-phase, but with multiple peaks on chiral HPLC. But that doesn't make sense because each product is a mixture of stereoisomers. So in normal-phase, each stereoisomer would have a different retention time. So for Reaction I, two stereoisomers â†’ two peaks. Reaction II, four stereoisomers â†’ four peaks. So in normal-phase, when combined, 6 peaks. But that's not in the options.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Let me try another approach. Maybe the products from the two reactions are the same. No, their structures are different. So that can't be.

Wait, perhaps the product from Reaction I is not chiral. If that were the case, it would have no peaks on chiral HPLC, but that's not possible because it has two stereocenters.

Alternatively, perhaps one of the products is a meso compound, reducing the number of peaks. Let's think:

In Reaction I: If the product is a meso compound, then it would have an internal plane of symmetry, making it achiral. So it would show as a single peak on normal-phase and no peaks on chiral HPLC. But meso compounds require that the configurations at the stereocenters are such that the molecule is symmetrical. In Reaction I's product, the two stereocenters are at C3 and C5. For a six-carbon chain, the positions are not symmetric, so it's unlikely to be a meso compound. So Reaction I's product would have two stereoisomers, two peaks on chiral HPLC.

Reaction II's product: Let's say it's a meso compound. Then, it would have two stereoisomers (the meso form and another). But wait, pentane-2,4-diol has two stereocenters. If both are R, or both are S, does that make it meso? Let's imagine the structure: HOCH2CH2CH(OH)CH2CH3. If the two OH groups are on the same side, perhaps it's a meso form. Wait, no, because the molecule is not symmetrical. Alternatively, if the configurations are R and S, but arranged symmetrically, perhaps it's a meso form. Let me think: if C2 is R and C4 is S, but in a way that the molecule has a plane of symmetry. For example, if the two OHs are on opposite sides, perhaps the molecule is symmetrical. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's not a meso compound, leading to four stereoisomers.

Hmm, perhaps the question is simpler than I'm making it. Let me think about the options again.

Option C says 4 peaks in chiral and 2 in normal-phase. How could that happen? Let's see:

Chiral HPLC: 4 peaks. That would mean 4 stereoisomers.

Normal-phase: 2 peaks. That would mean two compounds, each with no stereoisomers or where all stereoisomers co-elute.

Wait, but that can't be because both products have stereocenters. So perhaps the products from both reactions are the same compound, which is not the case.

Wait, perhaps the reaction products are identical. Let me think: Reaction I gives 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. Reaction II gives 2,4-pentanediol. No, they're different structures.

I'm stuck. Let me try to think of another angle. Maybe the products are not all stereoisomers. For example, maybe some of the stereoisomers are the same in the two reactions. But I can't see that.

Wait, perhaps in Reaction I, the product is a single stereoisomer. How? Because the starting material is (S) at C5, and perhaps the reduction leads to a specific configuration at C3.

Wait, LAH is a strong reducing agent, but perhaps it reduces ketones in a specific way. Wait, no, I think LAH typically leads to racemic mixtures because the ketone is planar. So unless there's some kind of chiral induction, which the problem doesn't mention, the product should be racemic.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the chiral HPLC is separating the four stereoisomers from Reaction II. But how does that fit into the options?

Wait, another possibility: perhaps Reaction I's product is a single stereoisomer because the starting material is chiral, so the reduction leads to a specific configuration at C3. Let me think: the starting material's (S) configuration at C5 may influence the reduction at C3. But I don't think that's the case because the two stereocenters are far apart.

Alternatively, perhaps the product of Reaction I is a meso compound, which would appear as a single peak on normal-phase HPLC but no peak on chiral because it's achiral. But that would require that the two stereocenters in the product are arranged symmetrically, leading to a meso form. But as I thought earlier, that's not the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the reduction leads to only one stereoisomer because of the steric environment. But I don't think that's the case; LAH usually doesn't care about that.

Wait, perhaps the product of Reaction I is a single compound, not a racemic mix. For example, if the starting material is (S) at C5, and the product's configuration at C3 is determined by the existing configuration. But I don't think that's possible because the ketone is planar, so the reduction leads to a 50:50 mix.

I think I'm stuck. Let me look at the options again. The only option where the chiral HPLC has more peaks than normal-phase is option C and A.

Option C: 4 peaks in chiral, 2 in normal-phase.

If that's the case, perhaps Reaction I gives two peaks on chiral and Reaction II gives two, but I don't know. Alternatively, perhaps the products from both reactions are the same, leading to fewer peaks.

Wait, another approach: the problem says that the products are combined and run on both columns. So if the two products are the same, then the peaks would add. But the products are different.

Wait, perhaps the products are the same. Let me think: Reaction I's product is 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. Reaction II's product is 2,4-pentanediol. They're different, so when combined, they would have distinct retention times on normal-phase HPLC. So two peaks on normal-phase (each product is a separate compound), but their stereoisomers would add to the peaks on chiral HPLC.

But all this leads me back to an initial assessment of 6 peaks on chiral and 2 on normal-phase. But that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm miscalculating the number of stereoisomers.

Wait, perhaps Reaction I produces only one stereoisomer. How? For example, if the product is a meso compound. Let me imagine: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. If the configurations at C3 and C5 lead to a meso form, then it would be achiral. So in that case, it would produce only one product, leading to one peak on normal-phase and none on chiral. But how?

Wait, the structure would have to have a plane of symmetry. For example, if the molecule is symmetrical around a central carbon. Let me imagine:

The molecule is (R)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. No, wait, perhaps if C3 is R and C5 is S, but arranged symmetrically. But with six carbons, it's hard to see that. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry between C3 and C5. If the substituents on each side are mirrored, then it's a meso compound. But I'm not sure. Let's think about the structure:

Positions: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

C3: OH (R configuration)
C5: OCH3 (S configuration)

If the molecule is symmetric, then perhaps C3 and C5 mirror each other. But since the substituents on C3 and C5 are different (OH and OCH3), it's unlikely. So the product would not be a meso compound.

Thus, Reaction I's product is two stereoisomers.

Reaction II's product is four stereoisomers.

Combined, 2+4=6 stereoisomers. So in chiral HPLC, six peaks. But the options don't have that.

Hmm. Since I can't find an option that matches, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think again about the possible products.

Wait, perhaps in Reaction I, the product is a single stereoisomer. How? Maybe the reaction doesn't proceed as I thought. LAH is a strong reducing agent, but perhaps it only reduces the ketone to an alcohol without creating a stereocenter. Wait, no, because the product would have a new stereocenter. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a single stereoisomer, maybe due to the starting material's configuration influencing the product. But I don't think that's the case.

Another thought: perhaps in Reaction II, the product is a single stereoisomer. For example, if the reduction leads to a specific configuration. But NaBH4 typically leads to racemic mixtures for each reduction. So with two reductions, it's four stereoisomers.

Wait, perhaps the reaction conditions affect the outcome. For Reaction II, using excess NaBH4 would drive the reaction to completion, but doesn't influence the stereochemistry. So four stereoisomers.

At this point, I think I'm stuck and perhaps should go with my initial assessment. But since the options don't include six, perhaps I made a mistake in counting.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the product from Reaction I is not chiral. How? If it's a meso compound. For example, if the molecule has a plane of symmetry making it achiral despite having two stereocenters.

Let me think of the structure again: 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. The configurations are S at C5 and R/S at C3. Suppose C3 is R and C5 is S. Could this make a meso compound? Let me imagine the molecule:

Positions:

1: CH3
2: CH2
3: CH(OH)
4: CH2
5: CH(OCH3)
6: CH3

If the configurations at C3 and C5 are such that the molecule is symmetric, then it could be meso. But in this case, the substituents on C3 and C5 are different (OH and OCH3), so it's unlikely. So the product is chiral, leading to two stereoisomers.

So I'm stuck. I'll have to make an educated guess based on the options. The correct answer is likely option C) 4 peaks in chiral and 2 in normal-phase. But I'm not entirely sure.


To analyze the problem, we evaluate the reactions and their products:

### Reaction I:
The starting material, **(S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one**, is treated with LAH followed by an acidic workup. LAH is a strong reducing agent that reduces the ketone group at C3 to a secondary alcohol, forming **5-methoxyhexan-3-ol**. The reduction introduces a new stereocenter at C3, while C5 retains its (S) configuration. Since the ketone is planar, the reduction at C3 leads to a **racemic mixture** of two enantiomers: (S,R) and (S,S). Thus, Reaction I produces **two stereoisomers**.

### Reaction II:
The starting material, **pentane-2,4-dione**, is treated with excess NaBH4 followed by an acidic workup. NaBH4 reduces both ketone groups at C2 and C4 to secondary alcohols, forming **2,4-pentanediol**. Each reduction introduces a stereocenter at C2 and C4, leading to **four stereoisomers** (RR, RS, SR, SS). These stereoisomers are distinct diastereomers.

### Combined Products:
After the reactions are complete, the products from both reactions are combined. The two products are structurally distinct: **5-methoxyhexan-3-ol** (from Reaction I) and **2,4-pentanediol** (from Reaction II). When analyzed together:

1. **Chiral HPLC**:  
   - Reaction I contributes **2 stereoisomers** (from the racemic mixture).  
   - Reaction II contributes **4 stereoisomers** (from the four diastereomers).  
   - Total = **6 stereoisomers**, which would result in **6 peaks** on a chiral HPLC.  

2. **Normal-Phase HPLC**:  
   - Reaction I and Reaction II are structurally distinct compounds.  
   - On normal-phase HPLC, compounds are separated based on polarity, not stereoisomerism. Thus, each product (Reaction I and Reaction II) appears as a single peak, regardless of the stereoisomers.  
   - Total = **2 peaks** on normal-phase HPLC.

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A**: 5 peaks in chiral HPLC and 4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC.  
  This is incorrect because the normal-phase HPLC would only show 2 peaks (one for each product), not 4.  

- **Option B**: 3 peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC.  
  This is incorrect because the chiral HPLC would show 6 peaks (from the 6 stereoisomers), not 3.  

- **Option C**: 4 peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC.  
  This is incorrect because the chiral HPLC would show 6 peaks, not 4.  

- **Option D**: 3 peaks in both chiral HPLC and normal-phase HPLC.  
  This is incorrect because the normal-phase HPLC would show 2 peaks, not 3, and the chiral HPLC would show 6 peaks, not 3.  

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is not explicitly listed in the options. However, based on the reasoning provided, the closest match to the expected results is **Option C**, assuming some stereoisomers may co-elute or the problem implies a simplified scenario.
