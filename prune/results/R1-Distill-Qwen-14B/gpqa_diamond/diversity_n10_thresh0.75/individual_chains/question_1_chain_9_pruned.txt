Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The question says there are two quantum states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. We want to clearly distinguish these two energy levels. The question is asking which energy difference option would allow us to clearly resolve them. The options are A to D with different eV values.

Hmm, I remember something about the uncertainty principle in quantum mechanics. Oh right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle! It relates the uncertainty in energy and the lifetime of a state. The formula I think is ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant.

Wait, but sometimes people use a more approximate version where ΔE ≈ ħ / (2Δt), or maybe even just ħ/Δt. I think for the purpose of this problem, it's the uncertainty in energy given the lifetime. So if the lifetime is the uncertainty in time, then the minimum energy uncertainty is ħ divided by the lifetime.

So each state has a certain lifetime, and that gives the uncertainty in their energy. If the energy difference between E1 and E2 is larger than the sum of their individual uncertainties, then we can distinguish them. Because if the difference is too small, the uncertainties might overlap, making it hard to tell them apart.

Wait, but in this case, each state has its own lifetime. So each energy level has its own uncertainty. Let me think. For E1, the lifetime is Δt1 = 1e-9 seconds. So the uncertainty in E1 is ΔE1 ≈ ħ / Δt1. Similarly, for E2, Δt2 = 1e-8 s, so ΔE2 ≈ ħ / Δt2.

But wait, I'm a bit confused. Do we need the energy difference to be larger than both uncertainties? Or just larger than a certain value derived from both?

Wait, perhaps the main point is that the energy difference must be larger than the uncertainty to be resolvable. So the energy difference must be larger than the uncertainty in energy for each state. But wait, each state has a different lifetime, so the uncertainties are different.

Wait no, actually, the two states are separate. The energy difference between E1 and E2 must be larger than the sum of their individual uncertainties. Because the uncertainty in E1 is ΔE1 and the uncertainty in E2 is ΔE2. So the total uncertainty in the energy difference would be ΔE_total = ΔE1 + ΔE2. Thus, the energy difference between E1 and E2 must be greater than ΔE_total for them to be distinguishable.

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, if the two states are being measured, the uncertainty
