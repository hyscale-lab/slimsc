Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to understand what it's asking. The question is about distinguishing two energy levels based on their lifetimes and energy differences. Hmm, I remember that the lifetime of a quantum state is related to its uncertainty in energy. Oh right, that's the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle.

So, the problem says we have two states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes (which I think are the lifetimes of these states) are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds. Wait, no, wait. Wait, actually, the question says the states have a lifetime of 10^-9 and 10^-8 seconds respectively. So each state has its own lifetime. But how does that relate to their energy difference?

I remember that the uncertainty principle states that the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) multiplied by the uncertainty in time (Δt) is on the order of ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. So ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2. So the idea is that the shorter the lifetime (Δt), the larger the uncertainty in energy. Or wait, wait. If a state has a short lifetime, that means it's not very well-defined in time, so the energy isn't precisely known, leading to a larger ΔE. So for each state, the uncertainty in energy would be roughly ħ/(2Δt).

Wait, but the question is about distinguishing two energy levels. So the energy difference between them needs to be larger than the uncertainty in energy of each state. Because if the energy difference is smaller than the uncertainty, you can't tell them apart— they would appear as a single peak or something in a measurement. So for clear distinction, the energy difference ΔE between E1 and E2 must be bigger than the sum of their individual uncertainties? Or maybe just bigger than each individually? Hmm.

Wait, I think I need to think about this. Let me think: each state has its own uncertainty in energy. So if E1 has a lifetime τ1, its energy uncertainty is ΔE1 ≈ ħ/(2τ1). Similarly, E2 has ΔE2 ≈ ħ/(2τ2). So the total uncertainty isn't the sum, perhaps. Or wait, maybe the combined uncertainty when measuring would involve both? Or perhaps the energy difference needs to be larger than the maximum of the two uncertainties. Because if the difference is larger than either uncertainty, you can distinguish them.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy difference must be larger than the sum of both uncertainties. Because you're trying to resolve two lines, each with their own broadening. I'm not
