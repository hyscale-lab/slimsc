Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about an aperture shaped like an N-sided polygon. All the apothems are the same length 'a'. A monochromatic light of wavelength Î» is shining along the z-axis, falls vertically on this aperture, and creates intensity maxima and minima in the far field. The question is about the angular distance between the first two minima when N is infinitely large. And they mentioned that for small angles, tan(theta) is approximately equal to theta.

Hmm, alright. So I remember that when light passes through an aperture, it diffracts, and the pattern observed is called the diffraction pattern. The far field region would be the Fraunhofer diffraction, which forms a diffraction pattern on a screen some distance away.

Wait, but the aperture here isn't a circular hole. It's a regular N-sided polygon. But they're saying N is infinitely large, so the polygon becomes a circle in the limit. Oh, right! Because as N increases, a regular polygon approaches a circle. So in this case, when N is infinitely large, the aperture is effectively a circular one. So the problem is essentially about a circular aperture's diffraction pattern.

Wait, but wait. The apothems are all the same length 'a'. The apothem of a regular polygon is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side, right? So for a regular polygon with N sides, the apothem is the same as the radius of the inscribed circle. So when N approaches infinity, the apothem 'a' becomes the radius of the circular aperture. So the radius R is equal to 'a'.

In that case, the diffraction pattern for a circular aperture is the Airy disk. The central maximum is surrounded by concentric rings of minima and maxima. The angular positions of the minima can be found using the formula for the minima in Fraunhofer diffraction.

Wait, what's the formula for the minima in a circular aperture? I think the condition for the minima is that the phase difference leads to destructive interference. The condition is given by a*b*sin(theta) = (m + 1/2)*lambda, but wait, no, wait. Let me think again.

For circular apertures, the diffraction minima occur where the Bessel function of the first kind has its zeros. The primary minima are at angles where J1(a) = 0, but wait, the first minimum is at a certain condition.

Wait
