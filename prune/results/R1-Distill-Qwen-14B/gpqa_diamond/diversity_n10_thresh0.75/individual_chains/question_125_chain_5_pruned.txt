Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me read it again. The question is about a particle in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential. The potential is given as V(r) = 1/2 m ω² r². Oh right, that's the Hooke's law kind of potential, so it's a harmonic oscillator but in three dimensions.

The question is asking about the energy of the third excited state and how many linearly independent eigenfunctions correspond to that energy eigenvalue. The options are A to D.

Hmm, I remember that in three dimensions, the energy levels of a harmonic oscillator can be expressed in terms of the quantum numbers for each direction. Wait, but wait, when it's isotropic, the potential is symmetric in all directions, so the energy depends on the sum of the quantum numbers. I think the energy levels are given by E = ħω (nx + ny + nz + 3/2), but wait, no, maybe it's (nx + ny + nz + 3/2) multiplied by ħω. Because for each direction, the energy is (n + 1/2) ħω, and when you sum them, you get the total.

Wait, no, each direction is a one-dimensional oscillator. So the total energy is the sum of each direction's energy. So for each direction, it's (n_x + 1/2) ħω, same for n_y and n_z. So adding them, E = ħω (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2). So the total energy depends on the sum of the quantum numbers.

Wait, but wait, sometimes we write the three-dimensional oscillator in terms of the angular momentum quantum numbers. Oh, right, because in three dimensions, especially harmonic oscillator, we can also consider the states in terms of the radial and angular momentum parts. Oh wait, but the potential is radial, so the states can be grouped by the principal quantum number n, which includes the angular momentum quantum number l. So for the 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator, the energy depends on the radial quantum number n_r and the angular momentum l, but I think in this case, the energy is the same for all states with the same n_r + l. Or is it? Wait, no, wait. Let's think again.

In an isotropic 3D harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are actually given by E = ħω (2n + l + 3/2
