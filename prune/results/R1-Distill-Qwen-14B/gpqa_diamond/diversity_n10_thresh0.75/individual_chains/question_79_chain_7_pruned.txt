Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is about.

So, the problem says that compound X, which has the formula C11H12O, was reacted with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. The product's NMR spectra are given, and we need to figure out what Compound X was from the options provided.

Hmm, wait, 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane. Oh right, that's a common reagent used in the formation of epoxides. I remember it's used in the Sharpless epoxidation or maybe other epoxidation reactions. Oh wait, no, that's more for asymmetric epoxidation. Alternatively, I think it's used in the epoxidation of alkenes using peracids. Wait, no, peracids like mCPBA are the usual ones for epoxidation. Wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. Oh right, 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is part of the HWE (Houthisch-Weizmann) reaction or something else... Wait, maybe it's part of the epoxidation conditions. Oh, perhaps it's a base used in the epoxidation with a peracid? Or maybe it's part of the catalytic system for another type of reaction. Alternatively, wait, perhaps it's a part of the reaction where an epoxide is formed, using a different method.

But wait, when an alkene reacts with a peracid (like mCPBA), an epoxide forms. So if Compound X was epoxidized, that would mean that X is an alkene, and the product is the corresponding epoxide.

Wait, but looking at the product's NMR data, the 1H NMR shows signals that might correspond to an epoxide. Let me think about the NMR.

The 1H NMR of the product: 

δ 2.28 (3H, s), 2.31 (3H, s), 6.75 (1H, d), 7.08 (2H, d), 7.68 (1H, d), 7.71 (2H, d).

So, two singlets for 3H each. That suggests two methyl groups attached to something deshielded. Maybe attached to oxygen, but in epoxides, adjacent CH2 groups would be split, but singlet suggests no neighboring Hs.

Wait, but in the product, perhaps there are two methyl groups attached to the epoxide ring. Or maybe as substituents elsewhere.

The aromatic region is from 6.75 to 7.71. Let's see the splitting: one doublet at 6.75, another at 7.08 (2H, d), then another at 7.68 (1H, d) and another at 7.71 (2H, d). Hmm, that suggests some sort of coupling in the aromatic system.

Wait, maybe there are two para-substituted aromatic rings? Or perhaps a substituent on a benzene ring that's causing some coupling.

The 13C NMR data:

21.3 (1C, s) – probably a methyl group attached to something electron-withdrawing, like oxygen. Maybe a CH3 next to an epoxide oxygen. Similarly, 28.4 (another CH3, perhaps also adjacent to an oxygen or another group.

The rest are carbons in the aromatic region. Let's see: 126.9 (2C, s) – maybe carbons in a conjugated system. 127.1, 129.1, 130.3, and the two higher ppm signals: 141.5 and 144.1, which could be carbonyl carbons or carbons attached to substituents.

Wait
