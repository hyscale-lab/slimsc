Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me see what it's about. Alright, it involves a diatomic molecule modeled with the quantum rotation-vibration model. Hmm, I remember that diatomic molecules can vibrate and rotate, and their energy states are quantized.

The question says the molecule is in its fundamental state. I think the fundamental state is the lowest energy state, right? So, the ground state. Now, the problem is about absorbing a photon that causes the molecule to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy. Wait, what's the next state? I guess it's the first excited state. But I'm not entirely sure if it's the next vibrational state or a rotational one. Or maybe a combination?

The options given are all momenta of photons. Oh, wait, the question is about the photon's momentum. Photons have energy and momentum related by E = pc, where p is momentum and c is the speed of light. So if I can find the photon's energy, I can find its momentum.

But first, I need to know the energy difference between the initial and final states. Since the molecule is initially in the fundamental state, the next state might involve a transition in either vibration or rotation. I remember that in the rigid rotor-vibration model, the energy levels are given by a combination of rotational and vibrational contributions.

Wait, the problem mentions the non-rigid rotor model, but I'm not too sure about the differences. In the rigid rotor, the bond length is fixed, but in the non-rigid model,
