Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the pH of a solution made by mixing three different solutions: acetic acid, HCl, and barium hydroxide. Hmm, I remember that when you mix acids and bases, they can neutralize each other. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I need to consider each of the components and how they react. Acetic acid is a weak acid, HCl is a strong acid, and Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. Oh right, when you mix acids and bases, they can undergo neutralization reactions, producing water and possibly a salt.

Let me calculate the moles of each component. To do that, I'll use the formula moles = Molarity × Volume (in liters).

For CH3COOH (acetic acid):
Molarity is 0.1 M, volume is 500 mL, which is 0.5 L. So moles = 0.1 * 0.5 = 0.05 moles.

For HCl:
Molarity is 0.2 M, volume 400 mL → 0.4 L. Moles = 0.2 * 0.4 = 0.08 moles.

For Ba(OH)2:
Molarity is 0.3 M, volume 300 mL → 0.3 L. Moles = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles. Wait, but Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so it dissociates completely. Each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives 2 moles of OH- ions. So the OH- moles are 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

Now, let me think about the reactions. HCl is a strong acid, so it will donate H+ ions. CH3COOH is a weak acid, so it will donate some H+ but not completely. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so it will donate OH- ions which will react with H+.

I think the H+ from HCl and the OH- from Ba(OH)2 will react first because they're both strong. Any excess H+ or OH- will then react with the weak acid or base.

So, H+ from HCl is 0.08 moles. OH- from Ba(OH)2 is 0.18 moles. Let's see how they react.

The reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O. So, moles of H+ = 0.08, OH- = 0.18. The H+ is less, so all H+ will be neutralized, and there will be excess OH-.

The excess OH- is 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 moles. Wait, wait, no. Let me recalculate. H+ is 0.08 (from HCl) and OH- is 0.18. So, the OH- is in excess by 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 moles.

But wait, the acetic acid is also present. So now, the excess OH- will react with the acetic acid. Because acetic acid is a weak acid, it can donate H+ but not completely. So the OH- will take H+ from the acetic acid.

The reaction would be: OH- + CH3COOH → CH3COO^- + H2O.

So, how much OH- do we have? 0.10 moles. How much acetic acid? 0.05 moles.

So, the OH- will react with the acetic acid. The OH- is 0.10, and the acetic acid is 0.05. So all the acetic acid will react, and there will be some OH- left.

Wait, let me see. The OH- will neutralize the acetic acid. So each mole of OH-
