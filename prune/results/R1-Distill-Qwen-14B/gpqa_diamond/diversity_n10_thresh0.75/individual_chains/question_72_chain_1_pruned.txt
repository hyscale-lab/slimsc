Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reaction mechanisms. Let's take it step by step.

The question starts with a compound called 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. I remember that bicyclo compounds have a bridged structure. The [2.2.1] part means there are two bridges, one with two carbons and another with one. So, the structure looks a bit like norbornene or something similar.

This starting material is combined with two equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide at elevated temperature. Hmm, I think this is a Diels-Alder reaction. Diels-Alder is between a diene and a dienophile. The diene is the bicyclo compound here, and the dienophile would be the cyclohexa-1,3-diene derivative. But wait, the cyclohexa-1,3-diene has dibromomethyl groups. Oh, right, the dienophile is the cyclohexadiene, and when it reacts with the diene, it forms a six-membered ring with substituents.

Wait, but 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)... each of those positions has a CH2Br2 group? Or is it (dibromomethyl), meaning each group is CH2Br2? No, wait, dibromomethyl would be CH2Br2? Or maybe each substituent is BrCH2. No, wait, 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl) would mean each substituent is a dibromomethyl group. So each substituent is a methyl group where two of the hydrogens are replaced by bromine. So each is Br2CH2- attached to the cyclohexadiene.

But wait, no. Dibromomethyl is -CH2Br2? Wait, no, that's not possible because a methyl group can't have two bromines unless it's Br2CH2â€“, but that's a -CHBr2 group. So each substituent is a -CH2Br group? Or wait, 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl) would mean two substituents on the cyclohexadiene
