Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about nuclear fission and kinetic energy. Hmm, I remember a bit about this from my classes, but I'm a bit rusty. Let's try to break it down.

The problem says an atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest. Its rest-mass energy is 300 GeV. Wait, rest-mass energy is given by E=mc². So M must be the rest mass, and its energy is 300 GeV. Got it.

Then it undergoes spontaneous fission and splits into two fragments. One fragment is twice as massive as the other in terms of rest-mass. Oh right, so let me call the two masses m₁ and m₂. Since m₁ is twice as massive, m₁ = 2 m₂. Also, the sum of their rest masses is 99% of M. So m₁ + m₂ = 0.99 M.

Wait, substituting m₁ = 2 m₂ into the sum, we get 2 m₂ + m₂ = 3 m₂ = 0.99 M. So m₂ = (0.99 M)/3. That simplifies to m₂ = 0.33 M. Then m₁ is 0.66 M. Because 0.33 times 2 is 0.66.

So the masses are 0.66 M and 0.33 M. But wait, the initial mass is M, and the sum of the fragments is 0.99 M. So where did the mass go? Oh, right, in nuclear reactions, some mass is converted into energy, like the binding energy. So the remaining 1% (0.01 M) must have been converted into kinetic energy and other forms like radiation or perhaps the energy of the fragments.

Wait, but in fission, energy is released, so the kinetic energy of the fragments must come from the mass defect. So the mass difference is the initial mass minus the sum of the fragments, which is 0.01 M. That mass difference is converted into energy, which is the kinetic energy of the two fragments. But how do I find each fragment's kinetic energy?

Since the initial nucleus is at rest, the total momentum of the system must be zero. So the momenta of the two fragments must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. That is, p
