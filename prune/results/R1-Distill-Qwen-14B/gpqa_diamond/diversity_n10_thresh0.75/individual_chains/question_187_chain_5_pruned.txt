Okay, so I have this question about the ESPRESSO spectrograph and which stars are detectable. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The question says that a star is detectable if the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) is at least 10 per binned pixel after a 1-hour exposure. So, I need to figure out which of the listed stars meet this criterion.

First, I remember that ESPRESSO is a high-resolution spectrograph on the VLT (Very Large Telescope) in Paranal. It's used for various astronomical observations, including exoplanet studies and stellar spectroscopy. The key here is to understand the capabilities of ESPRESSO in terms of S/N ratio for different stars.

I think the key factors here are the brightness of the star (apparent magnitude) because that affects the S/N. The brighter the star, the more photons we get, leading to a higher S/N. So, the apparent magnitude (m) of each star is crucial.

The formula for S/N ratio in a spectrograph is something like S/N = (flux) / (noise). But I'm not sure of the exact formula. Wait, I remember that the signal is proportional to the square root of the exposure time and the flux. Also, noise might be related to the background and read noise, but perhaps for this question, they assume some standard calculation.

Another thing is that the apparent magnitude of a star determines its flux. The lower the magnitude (more negative), the brighter the star. Since all the options have an absolute magnitude (M) of 15 except Canopus and Polaris, I need to calculate their apparent magnitudes.

Wait, for the stars a to e, options a is Canopus, which I think is a bright star. Polaris (option b) is also bright, but I'm not exactly sure of their magnitudes.

The other stars (c, d, e, f) have M=15, but at different distances. So, I can compute their apparent magnitude using the distance modulus formula: m = M + 5 log10(d/10), where d is the distance in parsecs.

Let me list the options again:

a) Canopus: I think it's a very bright star, maybe around magnitude -0.7? Wait, I remember Canopus is the second brightest star, right? So it's like 0.5 or so. Wait, no, I think Canopus is about magnitude -0.72. Let me confirm: I think Canopus is about -0.72, making it brighter than Sirius which is around -1.46. Wait no, actually Sirius is brighter. So Canopus is about magnitude -0.72. So it's a very bright star.

b) Polaris: Polaris is the North Star. I think it's a bit dimmer, maybe around magnitude 2.0 or so. Wait, I recall it's about 1.98, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's around 2.1 or so. So that would make it less bright than Canopus.

c) Star with M=15 at 10 pc. So m = 15 + 5 log(10/10) = 15 +0 = 15. But 10 pc is the base for the scale, so yeah, m=15.

d) M=15 at 200 pc. So m =15 +5*log(200/10) =15 +5*log(20). Log(20)=1.3010, so 5 * 1.3010 is 6.505. So m=15+6.505=21.505.

e) M=15 at 5 pc. m=15 +5 log(5/10) =15 +5 log(0.5) =15 +5*(-0.3010) =15 -1.505=13.495.

f) M=15 at 50 pc. m=15 +5 log(50/10)=15 +5 log(5). Log(5)=0.69897, 5 *0.69897=3.4949, so m=15+3.4949 â‰ˆ18.495.

So the apparent magnitudes for each star (from a to f) are:

a) Canopus: ~-0.72 mag (very bright)
b) Polaris: ~2.0 mag
c) 15 mag
d) ~21.5 mag
e) ~13.5 mag
f) ~18.5 mag

Now, the detectability depends on the S/N ratio. I think the ESPRESSO spectrograph's S/N depends on the star's brightness. So, the brighter the star (lower magnitude), the higher the S/N.

I need to find the S/N for each star. But how?

I remember that the S/N ratio for a star observed with a spectrograph can be estimated using the formula:

S/N = (F * sqrt(t)) / R,

where F is the flux, t is the exposure time, and R is the noise, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, another approach is that S/N scales with the square root of the exposure time and the flux.

Wait, I think for a given instrument, the S/N is proportional to the square root of the exposure time multiplied by the flux. So, for a star with a certain apparent magnitude, the flux is known, and the S/N depends on that.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look for the limiting magnitude of ESPRESSO. But I don't remember the exact number. Wait, the ESPRESSO spectrograph is a high-resolution spectrograph, but its sensitivity (i.e., how faint a star it can detect) depends on the exposure time and its collecting area.

ESPRESSO is coupled with the 8m VLT telescopes. The VLT has a large collecting area. So, perhaps stars up to a certain apparent magnitude can be detected with S/N of 10 in an hour.
