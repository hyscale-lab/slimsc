Okay, so I've got this physics problem about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The question says it's a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass m and maximum amplitude A. It obeys Hooke's law, so F equals -kx. We need to find the maximum speed, v_max. And the options are given with various expressions involving c, the speed of light.

Wait, in classical mechanics, for a harmonic oscillator, the maximum speed occurs when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. The potential energy is (1/2)kA², right? So then the kinetic energy is (1/2)mv²_max. Setting them equal, (1/2)kA² = (1/2)mv²_max, so v_max = sqrt(kA²/m). But wait, that's the non-relativistic case, and the options have some with c, so this must be a relativistic scenario.

In relativity, the energy isn't just kinetic plus potential as in classical mechanics. The energy becomes a combination of rest mass energy and kinetic energy, but how does that affect the maximum speed here?

Wait, wait. Let me think about the energy in the relativistic harmonic oscillator. The total energy E is the sum of the rest mass energy and the kinetic energy. But in the case of a harmonic oscillator, the total energy is quantized, but maybe this is a classical treatment, so we can treat E as a continuous variable.

Wait, but even in the classical relativistic oscillator, the potential energy is still (1/2)kx², but the kinetic energy isn't (1/2)mv². Oh right, in relativity, the kinetic energy is (gamma - 1)mc², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So gamma is the Lorentz factor.

So the total mechanical energy E would be the sum of the potential energy and the kinetic energy. At maximum displacement x = A, the velocity is zero, so all energy is potential. At x=0, all energy is kinetic.

So at x=0, E = kinetic energy = (gamma -1 ) m c². At maximum amplitude, E = (1/2)kA². So setting them equal:

(1/2) k A² = (gamma - 1) m c².

But wait, I'm not sure if that's correct. Because in the relativistic case, the potential energy might be different. Wait, no, the problem states that it's obeying Hooke's law, so F = -kx, which would mean the potential energy is (1/2)kx² as usual.

Wait, but in relativity, the force isn't just F = -kx? Or is it? The problem states F = -kx, so the potential is (1/2)kx². So the setup is the same as the classical case.

So the total energy E is the sum of kinetic and potential. At x=0, the potential is zero, so E is all kinetic. At x=A, the kinetic is zero, E is all potential. So:

(1/2)kA² = (gamma -1) m c².

Wait, but that would give:

(1/2)kA² = (gamma -1) m c².

Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). We need to find the maximum speed v_max, which occurs when the oscillator is at x=0.

So rearranging the equation:

(1/2) k A² = [ (1/sqrt(1 - v_max²/c² )) -1 ] m c².

Let me write that equation again:

(1/2) k A² = (gamma - 1) m c².

Let me solve for gamma:

gamma = 1 + (k A² )/( 2 m c² )

Wait, because (1/2)k A² = (gamma -1) m c² → gamma = 1 + (k A² )/( 2 m c² )

But wait, gamma is always greater than or equal to 1, so that makes sense.

Now gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²), so:

1/sqrt(1 - v_max²/c²) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² )

Let me call (k A²)/(2 m c² ) as a term for simplicity. Let me denote λ = (k A²)/(2 m c² )

So 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + λ.

Then, 1/(1 + λ) = sqrt(1 - v²/c² )

Square both sides:

1/(1 + λ)^2 = 1 - v²/c²

So v²/c² = 1 - 1/(1 + λ)^2

v² = c² [ 1 - 1/(1 + λ)^2 ]

v = c sqrt[ 1 - 1/(1 + λ)^2 ]

But λ is (k A²)/(2 m c² ), so 1 + λ is 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² )

Let me plug that in:

v_max = c sqrt[ 1 - 1/(1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² ))^2 ]

Hmm, look at the options. Let me see:

Option D is c sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (kA²/(2 mc² )) )² )

Yes, exactly. So that would be option D.

Wait, but another way to think about this: sometimes, people consider the relativistic oscillator where the potential is modified. But in this problem, the force is given as F = -kx, so the potential is (1/2)kx² as usual. So the setup is correct.

Wait, let me check the other options quickly.

Option C is sqrt(kA²/m). That's the non-relativistic case, so it's probably not the answer here.

Option A and B have square roots with 1 plus something. Hmm, but our expression involves 1 minus something. So only option D matches.

So the correct answer should be option D.


To determine the maximum speed \( v_{\text{max}} \) of a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass \( m \), maximum amplitude \( A \), and obeying Hooke's law (\( F = -kx \)), we analyze the energy balance in the relativistic regime.

In this problem, the total energy \( E \) of the system is the sum of the potential energy and the relativistic kinetic energy. At maximum amplitude \( x = A \), the velocity is zero, and all energy is potential:  
\[
E = \frac{1}{2}kA^2.
\]  
At \( x = 0 \), the velocity is maximum (\( v_{\text{max}} \)), and all energy is kinetic. The relativistic kinetic energy is given by:  
\[
E = (\gamma - 1)mc^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}.
\]  

Equating the total energy at \( x = 0 \) and \( x = A \):  
\[
\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = (\gamma - 1)mc^2.
\]  

Rearranging for \( \gamma \):  
\[
\gamma = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}.
\]  

Substituting \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \):  
\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}.
\]  

Let \( \lambda = \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \). Then:  
\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = 1 + \lambda.
\]  

Squaring both sides:  
\[
\frac{1}{1 - v^2/c^2} = (1 + \lambda)^2.
\]  

Rearranging for \( v^2/c^2 \):  
\[
v^2/c^2 = 1 - \frac{1}{(1 + \lambda)^2}.
\]  

Substituting \( \lambda = \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \):  
\[
v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}}.
\]  

Comparing this result with the given options, it matches **Option D**:  
\[
v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}}.
\]  

The other options are incorrect because:  
- **Option A** and **Option B** involve square roots with \( 1 + \) terms, which do not match the derived expression.  
- **Option C** corresponds to the non-relativistic case, where \( v_{\text{max}} = \sqrt{\frac{kA^2}{m}} \), and does not account for relativistic effects.  

Thus, the correct answer is:  
**Answer: D**
