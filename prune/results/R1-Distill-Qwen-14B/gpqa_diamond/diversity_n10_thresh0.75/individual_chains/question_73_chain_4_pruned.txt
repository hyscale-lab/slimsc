Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my relativity, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, the problem states that the two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m, and they're moving at speeds 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. The question is asking for the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

First, I remember that when dealing with relative speeds in relativity, you can't just subtract the speeds like in classical mechanics. Oh right, you have to use the velocity addition formula from special relativity. The formula is (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/c²), but wait, which one is moving which? Oh, in this case, astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, and astronaut B at 0.5c. So when calculating the relative speed of A from B's frame, it should be (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c²). Let me compute that.

Wait, let me plug in the numbers. The numerator is 0.1c, and the denominator is 1 - (0.3c²)/c². The c² cancels, so 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So 0.1c divided by 0.7 is approximately 0.1428c. So the relative speed is about 0.14c. Hmm, looking at the options, both options C and D have v_rel as 0.14c. So the relative speed part narrows it down to C and D.

Next, I need to calculate the total energy of the system. Since each astronaut is moving at relativistic speeds, their energies are their relativistic kinetic energies plus their rest mass energy. Wait, no, relativistic total energy includes rest mass energy plus kinetic. Or wait, actually, the total energy for each is gamma times m c squared. So for astronaut A, mass 2m, speed 0.6c. Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)). So (v=0.6c) gives v²/c²=0.36, so sqrt(1-0.36)=sqrt(0.64)=0.8. So gamma is 1/0.8 = 1.25. So energy E_A = gamma * m_rest * c². Wait, the rest mass is 2m, so E_A=1.25 * 2m * c² = 2.5 mc².

Similarly for astronaut B: mass 3m, speed 0.5c. v²/c²=0.25. So sqrt(1-0.25)=sqrt(0.75)=sqrt(3)/2≈0.8660. Gamma =1/0.8660 ≈1.1547. So E_B=1.1547 * 3m c² ≈3.464 mc².

Adding E_A and E_B: 2.5 + 3.464 = about 5.964 mc². So the total energy would be approximately
