Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says. The unknown compound has been analyzed using FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The goal is to determine its chemical formula from the given options: C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, or C6H12O.

First, I'll start by looking at the FTIR data. The problem states that there's a very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm⁻¹. Broad peaks in IR usually indicate O-H stretching. So, this could be from an alcohol, phenol, or maybe a carboxylic acid. But wait, a very broad peak is more characteristic of an alcohol or maybe a carboxylic acid. However, I should think about what other peaks are present. There are strong absorptions at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹.

The 1700 cm⁻¹ peak is typically a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Could this be a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe a carboxylic acid? But wait, a carboxylic acid usually has a broad peak around 3000 (from O-H) and a strong peak around 1700. However, the 1650 cm⁻¹ peak is a bit lower than a typical carbonyl. That might suggest something else. Maybe an aromatic ring with conjugation? Or perhaps an ester or a conjugated carbonyl group.

Next, the 1H NMR shows peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the protons on a double bond, like in an alkene. So, the compound has a double bond, which would explain the possible presence of a conjugated system. The presence of vinyl hydrogens suggests a structure with an alkene group.

Now, looking at the mass spectrum, there's a fragment peak at m/z = 45. Hmm. 45 is a common fragment. Let me think: 45 could correspond to something like (CH3)2O (which is 45: 12*2 + 1*6 + 16 = 46? Wait
