Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about identifying a compound based on its spectroscopic data. Hmm, let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll do my best.

The question gives me the data from FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The possible formulas are C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, and C6H12O. I need to figure out which one it is.

Starting with the FTIR data. It says there's a very broad peak around 3000 cm⁻¹. That usually indicates an O-H stretch, like in alcohols or maybe carboxylic acids. Wait, but the peak is very broad. Oh, right! Carboxylic acids have a broad O-H stretch due to hydrogen bonding. Or maybe it's an alcohol, but alcohols can also have broad peaks, but I think they are a bit less broad than carboxylic acids. Hmm.

Then, there are strong absorption peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. I remember that carbonyl groups (C=O) absorb around 1700. What about the 1650? Maybe that's another carbonyl, but maybe a conjugated one. Alternatively, it could be an aromatic ring with conjugation. Wait, if the compound has two carbonyl groups, that would fit with the 1700 and 1650. Like in a diketone or something. But also, maybe one is a ketone and the other is an ester or an acid. Or perhaps one is a carbonyl and the other is an aromatic C=C. Wait, aromatic C=C is around 1600, but 1650 is a bit higher. Maybe it's a conjugated carbonyl, like an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl. Oh, right! For example, an enone system where the carbonyl is conjugated with a double bond. That would cause the carbonyl peak to be around 1680 or so. So, maybe that's what's happening here.

Next, the 1H NMR shows peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl means there's a double bond. So the compound has a double bond, probably in conjugation with something else, like the carbonyl group. So maybe it's an alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyl compound. That makes sense with the IR data.

Looking at the mass spectrum, there's a fragment peak at m/z 45. Hmm, what fragments give 45? Common fragments are like (CH3)2O (which is 45, but that's 27 for the CH3 groups, no wait, 45 is for (CH3)2O? Wait, wait, the formula for (CH3)2O is C2H6O, which is a molecular weight of 46. Oh wait, 45... Wait, maybe it's something else. Wait, 45 is the molecular weight of CH3COOH (32 for CH3COO- and 18 for OH?), no, wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think:
