Okay, so I have this physics problem here about particle decays and the CERN Bubble Chamber. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to work through it.

The question says that a particle X⁰ decays into Y⁺ and Z⁻ with a proper lifetime τ₀ of 8e-16 seconds. The energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27 GeV, and the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV. The question is asking about the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. The options are various lengths, so I think it's about the proper resolution in terms of distance or maybe something else.

Wait, proper lifetime is the lifetime measured in the rest frame of the particle. But in the lab frame, the lifetime would be longer due to time dilation. Oh right, the formula for time dilation is τ = γ * τ₀, where γ is the Lorentz factor.

But how does that relate to the distance the particle travels before decaying? Because in the lab frame, the particle is moving, so it would travel a certain distance before decaying. The length it moves is L = v * τ. And the resolution of the Bubble Chamber must be good enough to detect this length, I think. Because if the particles decay too quickly, they don't move far enough, and the chamber's resolution needs to be at least that distance to see the decay.

Wait, but the problem is about the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. So maybe I need to find the velocity first, then the lifetime in the lab frame, then the distance, and then figure out what fraction of that distance needs to be resolved to capture 30% of the decays.

So let's break it down step by step.

First, calculate the Lorentz factor γ. γ is equal to E/(m c²), since E is the total energy. Wait, but E here is given as 27 GeV, and the mass is 3.41 GeV. So m c² is 3.41 GeV. Therefore, γ = 27 / 3.41 ≈ let me calculate that. 27 divided by 3.41. Hmm, 3.41 * 7 is about 23.87, 27 -23.
