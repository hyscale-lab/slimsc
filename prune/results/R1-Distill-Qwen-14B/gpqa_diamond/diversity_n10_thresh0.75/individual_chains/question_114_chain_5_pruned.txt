Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me see if I can figure it out step by step. 

The question involves two reactions and identifying the correct reagents A and B from the options given. Let me break down each part.

First reaction: butan-2-one + NaCN + A â†’ 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile.

Hmm, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, which is methylacetone. I remember that when ketones react with cyanide ions, it's typically a nucleophilic addition. But wait, the product here is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me draw that structure. 

Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Adding NaCN would add CN- to the carbonyl. Normally, the cyanide would attack the carbonyl carbon, breaking it and forming a cyanohydrin. So the product would be (CH3)2C(OH)CN. Let me count the carbons. Oh wait, butan-2-one is four carbons. So the product should be something like (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? Wait, no. Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)COCH2CH3? No wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. So the structure is CH2-C(=O)-CH2-? No, butan-2-one is CH3-C(=O)-CH2-? Wait, no. Let me think
