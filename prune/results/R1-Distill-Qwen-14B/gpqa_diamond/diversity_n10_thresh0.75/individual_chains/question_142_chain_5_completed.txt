Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. The question is about the density matrix of a qubit and where it's located in qubit space. Hmm, I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when dealing with mixed states. Right, this particular matrix is given as ρ = (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). 

Wait, let me think about what that represents. Oh! If I recall correctly, the density matrix for a completely mixed state of a qubit is given by this expression. Because each of the basis states |0> and |1> contributes equally, each multiplied by 1/2, right? So this would imply that the qubit is in a completely mixed state, meaning it's not in a pure state but rather a statistical mixture of |0> and |1> with equal probabilities.

Now the question is about the geometrical position in qubit space. I'm a bit rusty on how exactly density matrices correspond to points in space, but I think it's related to the Bloch sphere representation. Oh right! The Bloch sphere is a way to represent qubit states. For a pure state |ψ>, you can represent it as a vector on the unit sphere. But for mixed states, it's more complicated. 

The general form of a density matrix for a qubit can be written as ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where I is the identity matrix, σ are the Pauli matrices, and r is a vector in three-dimensional space. The vector r corresponds to the coefficients of the Pauli matrices. 

So, let's break down the given density matrix. The given ρ is (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2. Let me compute each term. |0><0| is the matrix [[1,0],[0,0]], and |1><1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. Adding them gives [[1,0],[0,1]], which is the identity matrix. So ρ = I/2.

Hmm. So according to the general form, ρ = (I + r·σ)/2. If ρ is I/2, then (I + r·σ)/2 = I/2. Subtracting I/2 from both sides gives r·σ / 2 = 0. So r·σ must be zero. But the Pauli matrices are σx, σy, σz. So r·σ = r_x σx + r_y σy + r_z σz. For this to be zero, each component must be zero. Because σx, σy, σz are all traceless and their sum can only be zero if each coefficient is zero. 

So r_x = r_y = r_z = 0. That means the vector r is (0,0,0). So the point in qubit space is at the origin. 

Looking back at the options, option C is (0,0,0). So that must be the correct answer. 

Wait, let me make sure I'm not making a mistake. Another way to think about it: the Bloch vector for a mixed state is shorter than the unit vector. But in this case, since the state is maximally mixed, does that mean the vector is at the origin? Because the identity matrix corresponds to the completely mixed state, and in the Bloch sphere representation, that's the center, not on the surface. 

Yes, that makes sense. So the correct position is (0,0,0), which is option C.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( |0\rangle \langle 0| + |1\rangle \langle 1| \right).
\]

This represents a completely mixed state of a qubit, where the qubit is in an equal statistical mixture of the states \(|0\rangle\) and \(|1\rangle\). To determine its geometrical position in qubit space, we use the Bloch sphere representation. For a general qubit density matrix, it can be expressed as 

\[
\rho = \frac{I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}}{2},
\]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix, \(\boldsymbol{\sigma}\) represents the Pauli matrices, and \(\mathbf{r}\) is a vector in three-dimensional space. For the given \(\rho\), we compute:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( |0\rangle \langle 0| + |1\rangle \langle 1| \right) = \frac{I}{2}.
\]

Comparing this with the general form \(\rho = \frac{I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}}{2}\), we see that \(\mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} = 0\). This implies that all components of \(\mathbf{r}\) must be zero (\(r_x = r_y = r_z = 0\)), meaning the vector \(\mathbf{r}\) is at the origin in qubit space.

Thus, the geometrical position of this density matrix in qubit space is \((0,0,0)\), which corresponds to option C.

Answer: C
