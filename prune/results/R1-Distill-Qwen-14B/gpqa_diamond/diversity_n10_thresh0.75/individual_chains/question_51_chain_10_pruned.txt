Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric potential energy. Hmm, let me think through this step by step. The question is about a charge placed near a grounded conducting sphere. I remember that grounded means it's connected to the Earth, so any excess charge should go to the ground. But wait, what does that imply for the sphere?

Alright, the setup: there's a charge q placed at a distance d from the center of a grounded conducting sphere with radius R. I need to find the net potential energy of this system. The options are A to D, each with a different formula.

I think the key here is to figure out how the charge q affects the sphere and vice versa. Since the sphere is conducting, the charge will induce charges on its surface. Grounding means that any induced charges will either leave the sphere or cause it to have a net charge, but in this case, the sphere is initially uncharged because it's grounded (I think that's the case). Or wait, maybe the charge on the sphere adjusts?

Wait, no. When you bring a charge near a conducting sphere, whether it's grounded or not affects how the charges distribute. For an ungrounded conducting sphere, the induced charges would be -q on the near side and +q on the far side, creating a dipole. But since this sphere is grounded, it can lose or gain electrons. So when I bring a positive charge q near the sphere, electrons will be attracted towards the near side. But since the sphere is grounded, those electrons can leave the sphere. So the sphere will have a net negative charge? Or will it just
