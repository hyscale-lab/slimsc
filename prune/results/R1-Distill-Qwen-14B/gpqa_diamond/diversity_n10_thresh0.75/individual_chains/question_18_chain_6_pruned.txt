Okay, so I've got this problem about stellar abundances, and I need to figure out the ratio of silicon atoms between two stars. Hmm, let's break it down.

First, I'll try to understand the given data. We've got two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their masses are 1.5 and 1.2 times the Sun's mass. But wait, do their masses matter here? The question is about elemental abundances, so maybe the masses are just extra info.

The abundances given are in terms of logarithmic ratios. So, [Si/Fe]_1 is 0.3 dex. Oh right, [X/Y] means log10(n_X/n_Y) - log10(n_X/n_Y)_sun. Or wait, no, sometimes it's defined as the logarithm relative to the Sun's value. So [X/Y] = log(n_X/n_Y) - log(n_X/n_Y)_sun. So it's the logarithm of the ratio of the star's abundance to the Sun's.

Let me jot down the given values:

For Star_1:
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0

For Star_2:
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0

Wait, H is hydrogen, so [Fe/H] is the metallicity, right? If [Fe/H] is 0, that means [Fe/H] is the same as the Sun, so the star has solar metallicity for iron. Same with Star_2: [Mg/H] is 0, so Mg is at solar abundance.

Wait, let me think about the Sun's composition. It says:

12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 → log(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5) ≈ 3.16e-5.

Similarly, 12 + log(nMg/nH) =7 → log(nMg/nH)=7-12= -5 → nMg/nH= 1e-5.

Wait, but these are the Sun's photospheric abundances. So for the Sun, nFe/nH = 3.
