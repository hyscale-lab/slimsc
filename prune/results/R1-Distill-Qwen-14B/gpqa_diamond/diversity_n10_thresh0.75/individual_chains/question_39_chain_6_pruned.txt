Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it carefully.

The question says that there are 10,000 identical systems, each with a particle moving along a tube (so the x-axis). The wave function for each particle is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i, where i is the square root of -1. When they measured the particles, none were found at x<1 or x>3, which means all the particles were found between x=1 and x=3. I need to find the value of 'a' from the given options.

Wait, so the wave function is a function of x, right. And since it's a quantum mechanical wave function, I think it should satisfy the normalization condition. Because the probability of finding the particle somewhere has to be 1. So the integral of the absolute square of the wave function over all space should equal 1.

But wait, the wave function given is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Hmm, so this is a complex function. The standard form of a wave function is usually a complex number, but for normalization, I remember that the integral of |ψ(x)|² dx should be 1.

So |ψ(x)|² is the product of ψ and its complex conjugate. Let's write that out.

ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i
The conjugate ψ*(x) would be (a / sqrt(1 + x)) + 0.5i.

So |ψ(x)|² = ψ(x) * ψ*(x) = [(a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i] * [(a/sqrt(1+x)) + 0.5i].

Multiplying these terms, it's like (A - Bi)(A + Bi) = A² + B², right? Because the imaginary parts cancel out. So in this case, A is a/sqrt(1+x) and B is 0.5.

So |ψ(x)|² = (a²)/(1+x) + (0.5)^2. So that's a²/(1+x) + 0.25.

But wait, that doesn't seem right. Because when you square the modulus, you have to compute each term. Let me do the multiplication properly.
