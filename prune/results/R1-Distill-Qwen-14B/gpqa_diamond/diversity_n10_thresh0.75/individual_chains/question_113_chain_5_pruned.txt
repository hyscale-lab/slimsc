Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it through again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question is about identifying an unknown compound based on its spectroscopic data. The techniques used are FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The options given are four different chemical formulas: C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, and C6H12O.

First, I'll break down the data provided for each technique.

Starting with the FTIR spectrum. It shows a very broad absorption around 3000 cm^-1. Broad peaks in that region usually indicate O-H groups, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. Wait, but a very broad peak might suggest a hydrogen-bonded O-H, which is typical of either an alcohol (like an -OH stretch) or maybe a carboxylic acid. But carboxylic acids have especially strong and broad O-H stretches. So that's something to consider.

Then, there are two strong absorption peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. Let's think about what those could be. The 1700 cm^-1 peak is a common region for carbonyl groups (C=O). So maybe a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid? The 1650 cm^-1 is a bit lower than the typical 1700 for a carbonyl. Hmm, maybe an amide? But amides have N-H stretches around 3300, which might not match the IR here. Alternatively, maybe that's a conjugated carbonyl or something else. Wait, another possibility: the 1650 could be a C=C stretch, but that's usually around 1600-1680. Oh, but wait, the presence of both 1700 and 1650. Maybe it's a conjugated system, like an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl compound. So perhaps an ester or a ketone with a double bond nearby?

Next, looking at the 1H NMR spectrum, there are peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the protons on a double bond, so that suggests the compound has a C=C double bond. So whatever structure this is, it must have a double bondâ€”maybe an alkene.

Now, the mass spectrum shows a fragment peak at m/z =45. Hmm, what fragments have a mass of 45? Let me think. The most common fragment at 45 is probably the CH3CO+ ion (acetate), which is 45. So that suggests that there's an ester group (-O-CO-O-) or maybe an acetyl group somewhere. Because esters have the structure R-O-CO-R', and the fragment would come from cleavage around the ester group.

Putting this together, let's think about the functional groups. The IR suggests O-H (maybe an ester, since esters don't have O-H unless it's a carboxylic ester, which is less likely here). Wait, no, esters don't have O-H. Oh wait, the broad peak might
