Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about symmetries in the SMEFT, which I think stands for Standard Model Effective Field Theory. Hmm, I remember that SMEFT is an approach used when considering beyond the Standard Model physics, where you write down all possible interactions respecting certain symmetries and then include higher-dimensional operators. 

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options given are Lorentz Symmetry, Poincare symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry. The choices are combinations of these four, and I need to pick the correct combination.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about each symmetry. 

First, Lorentz symmetry. I remember that in physics theories, Lorentz symmetry is fundamental. It's about how the laws of physics look the same in all inertial frames. In the Standard Model, all interactions respect Lorentz symmetry. So any operator in SMEFT must also respect this, right? Because SMEFT is built as an effective theory from the Standard Model, which already respects Lorentz symmetry. So Lorentz symmetry must be preserved, meaning operators in SMEFT must be Lorentz-invariant. So 1 is definitely correct.

Next, Poincare symmetry. Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations in space and time. So Poincare symmetry implies both Lorentz and translational invariance. But wait, in the SMEFT framework, the operators are added to the Standard Model Lagrangian. The Standard Model already respects Poincare symmetry, so any operator added should also respect it. But wait, SMEFT is a low-energy effective theory. Do all operators in SMEFT automatically respect Poincare symmetry? Or is it that the theory as a whole must respect it, but individual operators might not? Hmm. 

Wait, no. The effective theory is constructed to respect the same symmetries as the Standard Model, which includes Poincare symmetry. So all operators must be Poincare-invariant. So Poincare symmetry (option 2) must be respected. Wait, but Lorentz symmetry (option 1) is a subset of Poincare. So if operators already respect Lorentz, do they automatically respect Poincare? Or is it that Poincare is a separate requirement? Because Poincare includes both Lorentz and translation symmetries. So for example, the operators must be invariant under both. But in SMEFT, the operators are local, so they must respect both. So if all operators in SMEFT must be Poincare-invariant, then both 1 and 2 are correct.

Wait, but the question gives 1 and 2 as separate options. So I need to see whether Poincare symmetry is a must. Alternatively, maybe all operators in SMEFT must be Poincare-invariant. Because if they're not, the theory as a whole wouldn't be. So then 2 must also be correct.

Wait, but wait. SMEFT is constructed by adding operators of higher dimension to the Standard Model. The Standard Model respects Poincare, so the operators added must also. So yes, all SMEFT operators must respect Poincare symmetry, which includes Lorentz as a part. So 1 and 2 are both correct.

Next, CP symmetry. CP is Charge conjugation and Parity symmetry. Does SMEFT require all operators to respect CP symmetry? Hmm. I think the Standard Model doesn't
