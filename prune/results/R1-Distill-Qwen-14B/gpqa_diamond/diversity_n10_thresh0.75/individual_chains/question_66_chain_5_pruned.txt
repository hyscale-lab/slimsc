Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Hmm, I remember that SMEFT is an effective theory that incorporates all possible higher-dimensional operators respecting certain symmetries. But wait, which symmetries are those?

The question lists four symmetries and asks which must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are combinations of 1-4.

Let me think about each symmetry:

1. Lorentz Symmetry. I think SMEFT operators must be Lorentz invariant. Because effective theories should respect the same symmetries as the underlying theory, which in this case is the Standard Model. And the Standard Model is Lorentz symmetric. So all SMEFT operators should be Lorentz scalars. So 1 is a must.

2. Poincare Symmetry. Poincare includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. Since SMEFT operators are local, they should respect local symmetries like Poincare. Wait, but operators are built from fields, which are already Poincare invariant. So yes, all operators would respect Poincare symmetry. So 2 is also required.

3. CP symmetry. Wait, the Standard Model isn't CP symmetric. There are CP-violating terms, like in the CKM matrix. So SMEFT can have operators that violate CP. For example, the Weinberg operator is CP-conserving, but there are other operators that might not be. So operators in SMEFT don't necessarily have to respect CP symmetry. So 3 is not a must.

4. CPT symmetry. The Standard Model respects CPT symmetry. So all effective operators must also respect CPT. Because if they didn't, that would imply a breakdown in a fundamental symmetry of quantum field theory. So all SMEFT operators must be CPT invariant. So 4 is a must.

So putting it together, which symmetries must all operators respect? 1 (Lorentz), 2 (Poincare), and 4 (CPT). Wait, but wait, wait. No, because Poincare includes Lorentz and translations. So if the operators are part of a Poincare-invariant theory, they must respect both Lorentz and Poincare. So if 2 is included, then 1 is automatically covered.

Wait, the question is which of the following symmetries must each operator respect. So the question is, which of the four options (1,2,3,4) must each operator respect.

So for each operator, do they have to respect all four symmetries?

I think all operators must respect Lorentz (1), CPT (4), but not necessarily CP (3). And Poincare (2) would be a given because the SMEFT is a Poincare-invariant theory. So each operator must respect Poincare, Lorentz, and CPT.

Wait, but Poincare is a larger symmetry. So if an operator respects Poincare, it must respect Lorentz and translation. So if an operator is Poincare invariant, it's automatically Lorentz invariant. So for the question, the options are each symmetry. So the question is, which of the four symmetries must be respected by each operator.

So all operators must be Poincare symmetric (so 2 is a must), Lorentz symmetric (1
