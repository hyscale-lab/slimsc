Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, relativistic speeds, so I think I have to use special relativity equations here.

The problem states that the two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m, traveling at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively, both in the positive x-direction. The question is asking for the relative speed and the total energy of the system. The options are A to D, each with different values for v_rel and E.

First, let's tackle the relative speed. Wait, relative speed in relativity isn't just a simple subtraction like in classical mechanics because of the effects of relativity. In Newtonian physics, you'd subtract the smaller speed from the larger, but at high speeds (like a significant fraction of c), you can't do that. So I think the formula for relative velocity in special relativity is needed here.

The formula for relative velocity when two objects are moving in the same direction is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/c²). Let me check that—yes, I think that's right. So v1 is 0.6c, v2 is 0.5c.

Plugging in the numbers: (0.6c - 0.5c) divided by (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c²). Let me compute numerator and denominator separately.

Numerator: 0.1c.

Denominator: 1 - (0.3c²)/c² → 1 - 0.3 = 0.7.

So relative speed is (0.1c) / 0.7 → approximately 0.1428c. Hmm, looking at the options, option C and D have 0.14c for the relative speed. So that's possible.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't mix up the order. Oh wait, no, because in the formula, v1 is the speed of the first object as seen from the second, or the other way around? Wait no, the relative velocity of the first as seen from the second would be (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1 v2)/(c²)). But since both are moving in the same direction, yes, v1 is 0.6, v2 is 0.5.

So that gives us about 0.1428c.
