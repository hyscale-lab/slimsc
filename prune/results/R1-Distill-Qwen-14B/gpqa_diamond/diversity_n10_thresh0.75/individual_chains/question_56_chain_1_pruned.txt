Okay, so I've got this question about the hydrogen atom and transition probabilities. Let me try to think through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about the decay of the 3,0,0 state to the 1,0,0 state via two dipole transitions. I remember that dipole transitions involve the emission or absorption of a photon, and they're governed by the selection rules for quantum numbers in hydrogenic atoms.

Wait, the selection rules for electrons transitions in the hydrogen atom are usually given by delta l = ±1 and delta m = 0, ±1. Oh right, but the initial state is |3,0,0⟩. So l is 0, which is an s orbital. To go to another state, the next transition must change l by ±1. So from l=0, it can go to l=1, but not to l=2 because that's a change of +2, which isn't allowed in a single dipole transition.

Wait, but the question says it's a two-step process, right? So the initial state |3,0,0⟩ must transition to another state, and then that state transitions to |1,0,0⟩. So the first step would be from n=3, l=0, m=0 to some state with n=2 or 1, but wait, n has to change as well. Because for hydrogen, the energy levels depend on n, so transitions would involve a change in n.

But wait, in each dipole transition, delta n can be ±1 or ±2? Or wait, I think the selection rules for hydrogen are a bit more specific. I think the change in n (principal quantum number) can be 0, ±1, but wait, I'm a bit confused. No, wait, the main selection rule for the principal quantum number is that delta n = ±1. But wait, that's for electric dipole transitions. Oh, but wait, wait... no, that's not exactly right. For hydrogen, the selection rule for n in electric dipole transitions is delta n = ±1. Because for a hydrogen-like atom, the transition is allowed if delta n is ±1. But wait, wait, I think that's not correct. Let me think again.

The selection rules for the hydrogen atom (non-relativistic) are: delta l = ±1, delta m = 0, ±1, and delta n
