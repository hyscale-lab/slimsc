Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit rusty on some concepts, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again and understand what's being asked.

The question is about the percentage of blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes in a solution. The solution contains Co(II) ions and thiocyanate. The concentrations are given: total cobalt is 1e-2 M, and thiocyanate is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β values) for the complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16.

Hmm, I remember that stability constants (formation constants) tell us how stable a complex is. The higher the β, the more stable the complex. So each β corresponds to a different complex. Let me think about what each β represents. Usually, βn is the formation constant for the complex with n ligands. So Co(SCN)_1, (SCN)_2, (SCN)_3, and (SCN)_4 would have β1, β2, β3, β4 respectively.

Wait, but the question is about the percentage of blue dithiocyanato complexes. Dithiocyanato would mean two SCN- ligands, right? So that's the Co(SCN)_2 complex, which has β2=40.

Our goal is to find the percentage of this complex relative to all cobalt species in the solution. So I need to calculate the fraction of Co(SCN)_2 out of the total Co species.

I think we'll need to use the stability constants and the concentrations of Co and SCN- to find the distribution of the various complexes.

But wait, the total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M. That means the sum of all the Co species (uncomplexed Co²+ plus all the complexes) should add up to 1e-2 M. Similarly, the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M, but some of it is bound in complexes.

Hmm, this sounds like the application of the formation constants with the given concentrations and the distribution of species in solution. So we have to consider all possible complexes and their concentrations.

The general approach might be to model the formation of each complex step by step, considering the stepwise formation constants. Alternatively, we can think of each complex as a step in the formation from Co²+ and SCN-.

Wait, but for formation constants, it's usually easier to work with log β, but the problem gives β as numerical values. So for each complex, say Co(SCN)_n, the formation constant (βn) is the equilibrium constant for the reaction:

Co²+ + n SCN- ↔ Co(SCN)_n²−  (I think the charge would be 2−n, but maybe I'm getting that wrong. Let me think: Co²+ is +2, each SCN- is -1. So each SCN adds a -1, so for n SCN, the complex would be Co(SCN)_n^(2−n), right?)

But for the purpose of calculation, the charge might not matter as much as the formation constant.

So the stepwise formation constants are given, but sometimes the overall β is given as the product of the stepwise constants. Wait, no, in this case, the β values are given as the overall formation constants for each complex. So for Co(SCN)_1, β1 = 9, which is [CoSCN]/([Co²+][SCN-]).

Similarly, β2 is 40, which is [Co(SCN)_2]/([Co²+][SCN-]^2), and so on.

So if I can model the concentrations of each species, I can sum them up to find the total cobalt and the percentage for each.

But since there are four possible complexes, this could get complex (no pun intended). Maybe it's manageable with some assumptions.

Wait, but the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M, which is much higher than the cobalt concentration (1e-2 M). That suggests that there's a lot of free SCN- available, so the complexes might form
