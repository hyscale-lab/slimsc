Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The problem says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-). The concentrations are given: c(Co) is 1e-2 M and [SCN-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants for the cobalt thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. And the question is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes among all cobalt-containing species.

Wait, the blue dithiocyanato complex—so that's probably the [Co(SCN)_2]^(n+) ion, but I need to confirm. I remember that the color of the complex depends on the number of SCN- ligands attached. The blue one is the dithiocyanato, which is the [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ complex. So that's the third species in the formation, right? Because the complexes are [Co(SCN)]^+, [Co(SCN)_2]^2+, [Co(SCN)_3]^3-, and [Co(SCN)_4]^4- maybe? Or wait, the stability constants are given as β1, β2, β3, β4. So each β represents the formation of the next complex. So β1 is K1 for [CoSCN]^+; β2 is K2 for [Co(SCN)_2]^2+; β3 for [Co(SCN)_3]^3-; β4 for [Co(SCN)_4]^4-?

Wait, no, stability constants are for each successive step. So the first complex is Co(SCN), β1 is the formation constant for that. The second is [Co(SCN)2]^2+, which would have a β2, which is the product of K1 and K2 steps. Wait, no, βn is the overall formation constant for the nth complex. So β1 is the formation constant for [CoSCN]^+, β2 is the constant for [Co(SCN)_2]^2+, which is K1 * K2, but wait, no. Wait, no—each β is the cumulative constant. So β1 is K1 (formation of first complex), β2 is K1*K2 (formation of second), β3 is K1*K2*K3, etc. Wait, actually, no. Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. The stability constant βn is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex with n ligands. So for each step, the formation of the next complex would be:

Co^(n+) + SCN^- ↔ Co^(n+1+) (SCN)_m ... So, wait, maybe β1 is [CoSCN^+]/([Co^2+][SCN^-]), β2 is [Co(SCN)_2^(2+)]/([Co^2+][SCN^-]^2), and so on. So each βn is the equilibrium constant for the nth complex.

Wait, no, the cumulative stability constant. So if the first complex is [CoSCN
