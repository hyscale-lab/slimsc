Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the energy required for a nucleus to reach a certain speed. The nucleus in question is Li with 3 neutrons, which I think means it's lithium-6 because Li usually has 3 protons and if it has 3 neutrons, that makes 6 nucleons in total. So the mass number is 6, right?

The problem states that the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96c, where c is the speed of light. I need to find the energy of the RHIC under these conditions. The options are given in GeV, so the answer is going to be in giga-electron volts.

Hmm, I remember that in relativistic mechanics, the energy of a particle isn't just its rest mass energy anymore. The formula for total energy includes gamma, the Lorentz factor. The formula is E = γ * m0 * c², where m0 is the rest mass.

So first, I'll need to calculate γ. The Lorentz factor is given by γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Since v is 0.96c, let's plug that in.

Calculating v²/c²: (0.96c)^2 / c^2 = (0.96)^2 = 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of that is sqrt(0.0784) which is 0.28. So γ is 1 / 0.28. Let me calculate that: 1 divided by 0.28 is approximately 3.5714.

Wait, more accurately, 0.28 is 28/100, so sqrt is 28/100. Wait, 0.28 is 7/25, so sqrt(7/25) is sqrt(7)/5, which is about 2.6458/5 ≈ 0.52916? Wait, no, wait, I think I messed up the calculation. Wait, 0.28 is 2.8e-1. Let me think again.

Wait, no, let's compute sqrt(0.0784). Let's see: 0.28 squared is 0.0784, right? Because 0.28 * 0.28 = 0.0784. So sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28. So γ is 1 / 0.28 = 3.57142857, approximately 3.5714.

Wait, wait, no. Let me make sure. Because 0.96 squared is 0.9216, so 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28, correct. So gamma is 1 / 0.28 = 3.5714.

So now, I need to find the rest mass of the lithium-6 nucleus. The mass of a nucleus is approximately the sum of the masses of its protons and neutrons, right? Because for heavy elements, the binding energy is significant, but for lighter elements like lithium, maybe the approximation is better.

Wait, but wait, lithium-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. The mass of a proton is approximately 938 MeV/c², and a neutron is about 939.565 MeV/c². Wait, but I might need more precise numbers here.

Wait, I think the exact mass of a proton is about 938.272 MeV/c², and a neutron is about 939.565 MeV/c². So for lithium-6, which has 3 protons and 3 neutrons, the total rest mass would be 3*(938.272) + 3*(939.565) MeV/c².

Let me calculate that:

3 * 938.272 = 2814.816 MeV
3 * 939.565 = 2818.695 MeV
Adding them together: 2814.816 + 2818.695 = 5633.511 MeV.

Wait, that's 5633.511 MeV. But wait, wait a minute, because in reality, the mass of the nucleus is slightly less than the sum of the individual nucleons due to the mass defect (binding energy). So maybe I shouldn't be adding the individual protons and neutrons' masses because that overestimates the mass. Hmm, that complicates things.

But the problem gives me the nucleus as Li with 3 neutrons, so it's Li-6. The actual mass of Li-6 is a known value, but if I don't have that, maybe I should look for the atomic mass. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the rest mass of the nucleus as the sum of the individual nucleons, but that might not be accurate. Alternatively, maybe I can find the mass of Li-6 from standard tables.

Wait, the mass of Li-6 is approximately 6.0151 atomic mass units (u). Wait, but 1 u is about 931.5 MeV/c². So converting 6.0151 u to MeV: 6.0151 * 931.5 ≈ let's compute that.

6 * 931.5 = 5589 MeV
0.0151 * 931.5 ≈ 14.01 MeV
So total is
