Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle physics, specifically about the decay of a boson. Let me try to think this through step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to remember.

The question says that the interaction between the bosonic field X and fermions is given by the Lagrangian L(y) = -λ f ψ_f bar(y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, okay, so this looks like a Yukawa interaction term. I remember that Yukawa couplings are responsible for mediating the interaction between bosons and fermions, and they give mass to fermions when the boson field gets a vacuum expectation value (VEV), like the Higgs field.

In this Lagrangian, the boson X is interacting with fermions of type f. The term is λ times the fermion fields times (v + X). So when X is the Higgs field and v is its VEV, this gives the fermions their masses. But in this case, X is a boson, so probably a different field.

The mass of boson X is 6 GeV. So we're looking for possible decay channels of X into fermion-antifermion pairs. The allowed decays would be determined by the possible fermions that X can couple to, considering their masses and the energy available.

Wait, kinematical allowability depends on the mass of the boson being at least twice the mass of the fermion pair it's decaying into. Because each fermion has mass m, so the pair has 2m. So X's mass must be >= 2m. So for each fermion species, I need to check if 2m_f ≤ m_X.

So the mass of X is 6 GeV. So each fermion pair must have a combined mass ≤6 GeV.

Wait, but wait. The fermions that X can decay into are the ones that are present in the interaction term. So looking at the Lagrangian, X is interacting with fermions f. So which fermions are present?

In the Lagrangian, ψ_f is the fermion field. So the interaction term involves all the fermions f that X can couple to. So the decay products must be among the fermions f. So the boson X can decay into any fermion-antifermion pair that it interacts with (i.e., the fermions present in the interaction term), and whose combined mass is less than or equal to 6 GeV.

Wait, but the problem doesn't specify which fermions are present in the interaction term. The problem states that the interaction is given by that Lagrangian, but it doesn't say which fermions f are included. So perhaps the question is assuming that X couples to all possible fermions, except maybe some because of other factors like conservation laws or charge.

But wait, in the standard model, the Higgs field couples to all fermions except the top quark (no, actually, the top quark couples too), but wait, the top quark is heavy. Wait, in the problem's Lagrangian, the boson X is interacting with fermions f, but mass terms for fermions come from the v term. Hmm.

Wait, but in this problem, the mass of X is 6 GeV. So what fermions have a mass less than or equal to 3 GeV (since 6 GeV is the mass of X, so each fermion must be ≤3 GeV for the pair to be allowed).

Wait, but that's not correct. Wait, the mass of each fermion must be <= m_X / 2, because for decay X→ff̄, each f must have mass m, so 2m <= m_X. So m <= 3 GeV.

So let's list the known fermion masses.

Electron: ~0.0005 GeV
Muon: ~0.105 GeV
Tau: ~1.78 GeV
Up quark: ~0.003 GeV (current algebra gives about 2.2 MeV)
Down quark: ~0.004 GeV (about 4 MeV)
Strange quark: ~0.095 GeV (about 95 MeV)
Charm quark: ~1.275 GeV
Bottom quark: ~4.1-4.7 GeV
Top quark: ~173 GeV
But wait, I think the masses are higher. Wait, need to get accurate mass values.

Wait, more accurately:

- Electron (e): ~0.511 MeV ≈ 0.000511 GeV
- Muon (μ): ~105.7 MeV ≈ 0.1057 GeV
- Tau (τ): ~1777 MeV ≈ 1.777 GeV
- Up quark: ~2.2 MeV ≈ 0.0022 GeV
- Down quark: ~4.7 MeV ≈ 0.0047 GeV
- Strange quark: ~95 MeV ≈ 0.095 GeV
- Charm quark: ~1270 MeV ≈ 1.27 GeV
- Bottom quark: ~4700 MeV ≈4.7 GeV
- Top quark: ~173 GeV

Wait, so 6 GeV is the mass of X. So for each fermion, 2m_f <=6 GeV => m_f <=3 GeV.

So let's check each fermion:

- e: 0.0005 GeV → allowed (2m=0.001 <6)
- μ: 0.1057 → 2m=0.211 <6 → allowed
- τ: 1.777 → 2m=3.554 GeV. Wait, 3.554 >6? No, wait, 3.554 is less than 6? Wait, no: 3.554 is less than 6, so 3.554 GeV is less than 6 GeV. So τ can be produced. Because 3.554 <6, so yes.

Wait, wait, 2m_taus = about 3.55 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV. So yes, X can decay into tau pairs.

Charm quarks: m_c ~1.27 GeV.
