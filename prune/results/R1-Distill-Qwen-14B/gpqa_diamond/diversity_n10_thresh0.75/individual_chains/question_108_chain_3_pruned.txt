Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about comparing the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy of a hydrogen atom. Hmm, let me think through this step by step. I remember from my studies that paramagnetism involves the interaction of magnetic fields with atomic orbitals, especially when considering the spin of electrons.

The question says the magnetic field B is parallel to the Oz axis and has a value of 1 Tesla. Oh wait, Oz is the z-axis, right? So the magnetic field is pointing along that. The magnetic field is small, but B is 1T, which I think is a significant value. Wait, but the question says "small values of m"—m is the orbital magnetic quantum number. So maybe m is small, like m=0, ±1, etc. But how does that play into this?

The problem is asking me to compare the order of magnitude of the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy ΔE of hydrogen. The transition is associated with a wavelength λ=0.4861 micrometers. I remember that this wavelength corresponds to a specific transition in hydrogen, probably the Balmer series. Let me think, the Balmer series is when electrons transition to the n=2 level. The λ=0.4861 μm is the Balmer-alpha line, which corresponds to a transition from n=3 to n=2. That emits a photon in the visible range, right?

So the transition energy ΔE can be calculated using the Rydberg formula. The Rydberg constant R is approximately 1.097e4 m^-1. The formula is 1/λ = R (1/n1² - 1/n2²). Here, n1 is the higher energy level, so n1=3 and n2=2. Plugging in the numbers, 1/λ = 1.097e4 (1/4 - 1/9) = 1.097e4 (5/36) ≈ 1.097e4 * 0.1389 ≈ 1.536e3 m^-1. So λ is 0.4861e-6 meters, which matches the given value. So ΔE is the energy difference corresponding to that photon.

ΔE can be found using E = hc/λ. Planck's constant h is about 6.626e-34 J·s, and the speed of light c is 3e8 m/s. So E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (0.4861e-6) = let's compute that. 6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25. Divided by 0.4861e-6 m: 1.9878e-25 / 4.861e-7 ≈ 4.088e-19 J. That's the ΔE for the transition.

Now the paramagnetic coupling term. Paramagnetism arises from the interaction between the magnetic moment of electrons and an external magnetic field. The magnetic moment μ is given by μ = -g μ_B m_s, where g is the Landé g-factor, μ_B is the Bohr magneton, and m_s is the spin magnetic quantum number. Wait, but in the context of atoms, the orbital magnetic moment is μ_orbital = -μ_B m, where m is the orbital quantum number (like l). But I'm a bit confused here. Oh wait, the paramagnetic coupling term is the perturbation energy due to the magnetic field.

So the paramagnetic term H' is given by H' = -μ·B. The magnetic moment here is the orbital magnetic moment, I think, because the spin-orbit coupling would be a different term. Wait, but in some cases, the paramagnetism comes from the spin, but in others, it's orbital. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the paramagnetic coupling is
