Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a boson. Let me think through it step by step. 

The question gives me a Lagrangian interaction term between a bosonic field X and some fermions. The term is given by L(y) = -λf ψ̄_f (y)(υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, I think this is a Yukawa interaction, right? Because Yukawa couplings are terms where a scalar (like the X boson here) interacts with fermions through a Yukawa coupling term. 

The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. The question is about the kinematically allowed decays of X at the lowest order. So, I need to consider what fermions X can decay into.

In particle physics, a boson can decay into a pair of fermions if the sum of their rest masses is less than the mass of the boson. So, the decay X → f f̄ is allowed if 2m_f ≤ m_X.

Let me list the known fermion masses. Wait, I should remember the approximate masses of the quarks and leptons. 

The quarks have masses (in GeV/c²) roughly as follows:
- Up and down: about 2-5 MeV each, so very light.
- Strange: ~100 MeV.
- Charm: ~1.5 GeV.
- Bottom: ~4.5 GeV.
- Top: way heavier, around 173 GeV.
Leptons:
- Electron: ~0.0005 GeV.
- Muon: ~0.1 GeV.
- Tau: ~1.777 GeV.

So the X boson is 6 GeV. 

Let me compute 2m_f for each possible fermion pair:
- Electron and positron: 2*0.0005 = 0.001 GeV. X can decay into e+ e-.
- Muon and antimuon: 2*0.1 = 0.2 GeV. So yes, allowed.
- Tau and antitau: 2*1.777 ≈ 3.554 GeV. X is 6 GeV, so that's allowed.
- Quarks:
   - Up and anti-up
