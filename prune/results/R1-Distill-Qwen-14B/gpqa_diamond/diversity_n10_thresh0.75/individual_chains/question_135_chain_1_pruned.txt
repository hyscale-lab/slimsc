Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll take it slow.

The question is about the decay of a boson X, which has a mass of 6 GeV. The interaction Lagrangian is given, but I'm not sure if I need to look at that closely. Wait, the Lagrangian is L = -λf ψ̄ f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, maybe this tells me about the coupling between the boson X and the fermions. The fermion fields are ψ_f, and λf is the coupling constant for each fermion species. 

So the mass of X is 6 GeV, and I need to find the kinematically allowed decays. Kinematically allowed means that the energy must be enough to produce the particles. So for X to decay into two particles, say f and f-bar, the mass of X must be at least twice the mass of the fermion (because each has mass m, so 2m ≤ MX). 

Wait, but wait. Fermions have different masses. So which fermions have masses less than 3 GeV (since 6 GeV divided by 2 is 3 GeV)? Let me list the known fermion masses.

Leptons: electrons are about 0.511 MeV, negligible. Muons are ~105.7 MeV. Tau leptons are ~1.78 GeV. 

Quarks: up and down are light, maybe a few MeV each. Strange quark is about 100 MeV, charm around 1.5 GeV, bottom around 4.5 GeV, top is way too heavy at ~173 GeV.

Wait, so the mass of X is 6 GeV. So when X decays into a fermion-antifermion pair, the sum of their rest masses must be less than or equal to 6 GeV.

But wait, actually, for a decay to be allowed, the rest mass of X must be greater than or equal to twice the mass of the fermion. Because if each fermion has mass m, then 2m ≤ MX.

So let's list the fermion masses:

- Electron (e
