Okay, so I have this question about stars and their distribution in the sky, particularly how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance—oh right, the formula is distance = 1 / parallax in parsecs. So if a star has a parallax of 1 arcsecond, it's 1 parsec away. But how does this relate to the number of stars we see?

The question says the stars are uniformly distributed. Uniform distribution usually means that the number density is constant in the volume. Wait, but if the stars are spread out uniformly in space, then their distribution in terms of parallax would depend on how parallax relates to distance and the geometry of how we observe them.

I think about the volume of a spherical shell at a certain distance. The volume of a thin shell with radius r and thickness dr is about 4πr² dr. Since the stars are uniformly distributed, the number of stars in that shell should be proportional to the volume, right? So number of stars dN would be proportional to r² dr.

But how does parallax come into play here? Parallax plx is 1/r, so r is 1/plx. Substituting r into the expression, dN is proportional to (1/plx)^2 * dr. But wait, dr is the change in distance. Since plx = 1/r, dr = - (1/plx²) dplx. Wait, that's a bit confusing. Let me think again.

If plx = 1/r, then r = 1/plx. So dr = - (1 / plx²) dplx. But since we're dealing with positive parallax, maybe I can ignore the negative sign for now. So dr is proportional to (1/plx²) dplx.

Substituting back into dN: dN = k * r² dr, where k is the number density. So r² is (1/plx)^2. And dr is (1/plx²) dplx. So putting it together: dN = k * (1/plx²) * (1/plx²) dplx. That would be k * (1/plx^4) dplx.

Wait, that would make the number of stars per unit parallax (dN/dplx) proportional to 1/plx^4. But wait, the question is about the number per unit range of plx, which I think is the same as dN/dplx. So the number would go down as plx increases, which makes sense because distant stars are fewer in number per unit parallax.

But wait, did I make a miscalculation? Let's go step by step:

1. dN is proportional to r² dr. Since r = 1/plx, dr = (dr)/(dplx) * dplx = (-1/plx²) dplx.

So dN = k * r² dr = k * (1/plx)^2 * (-1/plx²) dplx.

But since dN is positive, maybe I should take absolute value, so dN = k * (1/plx^4) dplx.

So dN/dplx is proportional to 1/plx^4. So the number of stars per unit plx decreases as 1 over plx to the fourth power.

Wait, but the options include 1/plx^4 as option A. So the answer should be A.

But wait, another approach: think in terms of solid angle. The number of stars in a certain parallax range depends on how many stars lie in that corresponding distance range. For a given parallax plx, the distance r is 1/plx. The volume element in spherical coordinates is r² sinθ dθ dφ dr. But wait, maybe thinking in terms of area.

Alternatively, considering thin spherical shells. The number of stars in a shell of radius r and thickness dr is 4πr² dr multiplied by the number density of stars (n), so n * 4π r² dr.

Expressed in terms of parallax, plx = 1/r, so r = 1/plx. dr = - (1/plx²) dplx. So substituting, number of stars in a parallax interval dplx is n *4π (1/plx^2) [ (1/plx²) dplx ].

So that's n *4π * (1/plx^4) dplx. So the number per unit parallax is proportional to 1/plx^4. So that's option A.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when you have a distribution in 3D, the projection can affect things. But in this question, it's assumed that stars are uniformly distributed in space, so the math should hold.

So yeah, the correct answer should be option A, ~1/plx^4.


To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we start by considering the relationship between parallax and distance. Parallax is inversely proportional to distance: \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{r} \), where \( r \) is the distance in parsecs. For a uniform distribution of stars in space, the number of stars in a thin spherical shell of radius \( r \) and thickness \( dr \) is proportional to the volume of the shell, which is \( 4\pi r^2 dr \).

Expressing \( r \) in terms of parallax, \( r = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \), and substituting into the volume expression, the number of stars in the shell becomes proportional to \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} \). The thickness \( dr \) can also be expressed in terms of \( d\text{plx} \) as \( dr = -\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d\text{plx} \). Substituting this into the expression for the number of stars, we find:

\[
dN \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} \cdot \frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d\text{plx} = \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} d\text{plx}.
\]

Thus, the number of stars per unit range of parallax (\( \frac{dN}{d\text{plx}} \)) is proportional to \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} \). This means that as parallax increases, the number of stars per unit parallax decreases more steeply.

The correct answer is:

**Answer: A**
