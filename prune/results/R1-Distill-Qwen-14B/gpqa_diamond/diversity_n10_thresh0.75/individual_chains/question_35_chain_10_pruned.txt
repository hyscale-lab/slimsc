Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about the intrinsic angular momentum of a muon. Hmm, angular momentum operators are involved. Let me try to break this down step by step.

The question says that the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator A, which is Ay, is represented by a 2x2 matrix. It's given by Ay = c·S, where c is h/(4π), and S is a specific 2x2 matrix. The matrix S has the first row as (0, -i) and the second row as (i, 0). I remember that in quantum mechanics, spin matrices often look like this. Oh right, the Pauli matrices! Wait, the Pauli Y matrix is exactly this. So S is the Pauli Y matrix.

The task is to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. Then, evaluate which of the statements A to D is correct.

Let me write down what I know. The Pauli Y matrix σy is:

σy = [[0, -i],
       [i, 0]]

So S here is σy. The operator Ay is c times σy, with c = h/(4π). So Ay = (h/(4π)) * σy.

Eigenvalue equation is Ay φ = a φ. So I need to find the eigenvalues 'a' and eigenvectors φ.

Wait, for a 2x2 matrix, the eigenvalues are found by solving the characteristic equation det(Ay - a I) = 0.

But since Ay is proportional to σy, which has known eigenvalues. The Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±1, right? Because for any Pauli matrix σ, the eigenvalues are ±1. So if S is σy, then the eigenvalues of S are ±1. Therefore, the eigenvalues of Ay would be c multiplied by these. So a = c * (±1). Let's compute that.

c is h/(4π), so a = h/(4π) * (±1) → a = ±h/(4π).

Wait, but wait another thing. The eigenvalues of a spin operator in quantum mechanics for spin-½ particles (like a muon) are indeed ±ħ/2. Oh wait, wait, wait. Because the spin angular momentum operator S is ħ times the Pauli matrices divided by 2, right?

Wait
