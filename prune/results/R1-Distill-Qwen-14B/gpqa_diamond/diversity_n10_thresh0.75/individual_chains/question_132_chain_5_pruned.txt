Okay, so I've got this NMR question here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about identifying two aromatic compounds in a 1:1 mixture based on their NMR spectra. The molecular formula is C10H14 for both. The NMR shows two singlets around 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio, and three singlets around 2.2 ppm in a 2:1:1 ratio.

Wait, aromatic protons usually show up in the range of about 6.5-8.5 ppm. Since there are two singlets around 6.7, that suggests each compound has equivalent protons in their aromatic rings. Because it's a 1:1 mixture, each compound contributes equally to the signals. So, if each aromatic compound has two sets of equivalent protons, but in the mixture, each contributes a singlet. Or maybe each has a single type of aromatic proton, but as a singlet.

Wait, but each compound contributes a singlet, so each has all equivalent aromatic protons? Or perhaps each contributes a singlet because their aromatic regions are the same. Wait, no, because it's a mixture. Let me think again.

The two aromatic compounds each have their own set of aromatic protons. But if each has a single type of aromatic proton, they'd each give a singlet. But since the mixture is 1:1, the two singlets would integrate as 1:1. So for each compound, their aromatic protons are all equivalent, leading to a singlet. But that's rare unless the compounds are highly symmetrical.

Alternatively, each compound might have two sets of equivalent aromatic protons, but in the mixture, they add up to two singlets. Hmm, maybe not. Let me think about the options.

The options are:
A) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene
B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene
C) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene
D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene

Wait, 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene is para-substituted with four methyl groups? No, wait, 1,2,3,4 positions on benzene would be adjacent. Wait, benzene is a ring, so 1,2,3,4 would be like four substituents in a row. Wait, that's not possible because benzene is a six-membered ring. Wait, 1,2,3,4 would be four substituents on four consecutive carbons, but benzene is a six-membered ring, so that's possible. Oh, but that would make the molecule highly symmetrical. For example, 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene would have methyl groups on four consecutive carbons, but that's equivalent to a 1,3,5 substitution
