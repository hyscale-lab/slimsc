Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and their transit probabilities. Hmm, let's see. I remember that the transit method is when a planet passes in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability of this happening depends on the size of the planet and the star, and the size of the planet's orbit.

The question says there are two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have the same mass, which I think is important because the RV method detects them based on their mass. But for transit probability, mass might not be the main factor. Instead, it's about how likely the planet's orbit is aligned edge-on enough for us to see the transit.

They both have circular orbits. Oh right, circular orbits simplify things because the distance from the star is constant. So the only thing that matters for the transit geometry is the orbital plane alignment.

The orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than Planet_2's. So if Planet_1's period is P, Planet_2's is 3P. Wait, no, wait: the question says Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. So if Planet_2 has a period of, say, 3 years, Planet_1's is 1 year. So Planet_1 is orbiting much closer to its star since it has a shorter period. 

The host stars: Planet_1's star has twice the mass of Planet_2's star. But both stars have the same radius. Interesting. So more massive star, same radius. That would make Planet_1's star hotter, perhaps, but same size. 

Transit probability formula: I remember that the probability is proportional to (R_planet / R_star)^2 * (a / (a * sin i))² or something like that? Wait, no, the transit probability P is given by (R_p / R_s)^2 / ( (a_p / R_s)² - R_p²/(a_p²) ) )^(1/2) ), but I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should think about it differently.

Wait, the probability P is approximately (R_p / R_s)² / ( (a_p sin i) / R_s )² ), but actually, the main formula I remember is P = (R_p / R_s)^2 / ( (a_p / R_s)² (1 -
