Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the structure of compound E. Let me try to break it down step by step.

Alright, the reaction scheme starts with compound A. When A reacts with HCN, it produces compound B. Then, B is reduced with H2 and Pd to form C. Next, C reacts with HNO2 to give D, and D eliminates an inert gas to form E.

The hints are also important. Hints a and b give some clues about the structures. Let me look at each part.

First, let's look at the first part of the problem: the reaction sequence.

1. A → B via HCN. Hmm, HCN usually adds to carbonyl groups. So if A has a carbonyl, like a ketone or aldehyde, adding HCN would form a cyanohydrin. Wait, but sometimes it could also undergo addition in other contexts. Alternatively, perhaps A is a cyclohexenone or something similar. Wait, but let me think—HCN adds to ketones. So A is a ketone, perhaps.

2. B is then reduced with H2 and Pd. That's hydrogenation. So if B has a nitrile group from the HCN addition, reducing a nitrile would give an amine, but wait, no—wait, when a ketone reacts with HCN, it forms a cyanohydrin. The cyanohydrin is a secondary alcohol with a CN group adjacent. So when you hydrogenate that, the nitrile (CN) would reduce to CH2NH2? Wait no, H2 with Pd is catalytic hydrogenation, which would typically reduce triple bonds or nitriles to amines. So if B is a cyanohydrin (say, a cyclo structure with an OH and CN group adjacent), then reducing the CN group would make it CH2NH2? But wait, hydrogenation of nitriles usually gives amines. Wait, but maybe in this case, the structure is such that the CN is part of a ring. Hmm, perhaps it's a cyclopropane or something. Alternatively, maybe the hydrogenation is of double bonds, but I'm not sure yet.

Wait, let me think again. HCN adds to a carbonyl group. So for example, if A is cyclohexanone, then adding HCN would give a cyanohydrin, which would have an OH and CN group on adjacent carbons. So compound B would be something like that. Then, when B is hydrogenated (H2, Pd), that would reduce any double bonds or triple bonds. But in the cyanohydrin, what's the structure? It would have an OH and a CN group attached to adjacent carbons. Wait, but hydrogenation of CN usually gives CH2NH2. Alternatively, perhaps the hydrogenation is of a ring. Maybe the initial compound has a ring with a carbonyl group. Wait, perhaps it's a cyclohexenone structure. Let me think about this.

Wait, maybe I should look at the other hint. Hint a says that when compound A is reacted with an unknown phosphorous ylide, it forms 1,2-dimethyl-4
