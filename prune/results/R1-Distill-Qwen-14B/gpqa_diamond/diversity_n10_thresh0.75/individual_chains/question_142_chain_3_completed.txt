Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty on density matrices, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

The density matrix given is ρ = (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). And the question is about its geometrical position in the qubits space. The options are vectors in 3D space, labeled A to D.

Hmm, I remember that in the Bloch sphere representation, any single-qubit state can be represented as a point on the surface of a sphere. For a pure state, it's a vector from the origin pointing to a point on the sphere. But wait, this is a density matrix, so it's a mixed state, not a pure state. Oh right, because the density matrix of a pure state has a trace of 1 and a rank of 1, but this one... wait, what's the structure here?

Let me think: |0><0| is a matrix with 1 at (1,1) and 0 elsewhere. Similarly, |1><1| is the same but with 1 at (2,2). So adding them together, each gives (1,0,0,1) when written out as a 2x2 matrix, I think. Then multiplying by 1/2, each element on the diagonal becomes 1/2. So the density matrix ρ is:

[[1/2, 0],
 [0, 1/2]]

So ρ is a diagonal matrix with both diagonal elements equal to 1/2. Now, for a single qubit, the Bloch sphere representation uses a vector (x, y, z) where the components are related to the density matrix elements.

The general form of a density matrix for a qubit is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where I is the identity matrix, r is a vector (x, y, z), and σ are the Pauli matrices. So, if I can express ρ in terms of the identity and the Pauli matrices, then r would give me the position.

Let me rewrite ρ: I know that I is [[1,0],[0,1]], and σ_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], σ_y is [[0,-i],[i,0]], σ_z is [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So when I compute (I + r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z)/2, I get:

(1 + r_z)/2  (r_x - i r_y)/2
(r_x + i r_y)/2  (1 - r_z)/2

Comparing this to our ρ, which is diag(1/2, 1/2), that means the (1,2) and (2,1) elements must be zero, and the diagonal elements are 1/2 each.

So let's set up equations. The (1,1) element of our expression is (1 + r_z)/2, which equals 1/2. So (1 + r_z)/2 = 1/2 → 1 + r_z = 1 → r_z = 0.

Similarly, the (2,2) element is (1 - r_z)/2 = 1/2. Plugging r_z=0, (1-0)/2=1/2, which checks out.

Now, the off-diagonal terms are (r_x - i r_y)/2 and (r_x + i r_y)/2. These must be zero because our ρ has off-diagonal terms zero. So:

(r_x - i r_y)/2 = 0 → r_x - i r_y = 0 → r_x = i r_y.

But r_x and r_y are real numbers because r is a real vector. So the only solution is r_x = 0 and r_y = 0.

Wait, because if r_x is i times r_y, but both are real. The only way that holds is if r_x = 0 and r_y = 0.

So putting it all together, r_z is 0, and r_x and r_y are 0. So the vector r is (0, 0, 0). But wait, the Bloch sphere has points on or inside the sphere of radius 1. The origin is the completely mixed state, which is the maximally mixed state for a qubit. Oh, right, because when r is zero, ρ is (I)/2, which is the maximally mixed state. 

Let me double-check. The maximally mixed state for a qubit is indeed (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2, which is exactly what's given. So yes, the vector r is at the origin.

Looking at the options, option C is r=(0,0,0), which matches. So the answer should be option C.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left| 0 \right\rangle \left\langle 0 \right| + \left| 1 \right\rangle \left\langle 1 \right| \right).
\]

This matrix is diagonal with both diagonal elements equal to \( \frac{1}{2} \), and the off-diagonal elements are zero. This represents a maximally mixed state for a single qubit.

In the Bloch sphere representation, the density matrix of a single qubit can be expressed as 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} \right),
\]

where \( I \) is the identity matrix, \( \boldsymbol{\sigma} \) are the Pauli matrices, and \( \mathbf{r} = (x, y, z) \) is a real vector that determines the position of the state in the Bloch sphere. Comparing this general form to the given density matrix, the off-diagonal terms of \( \rho \) are zero, which implies \( x = 0 \) and \( y = 0 \). Additionally, the diagonal terms are equal, which implies \( z = 0 \). Therefore, the vector \( \mathbf{r} \) is 

\[
\mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0).
\]

This corresponds to the origin in the Bloch sphere, which represents the maximally mixed state. Among the given options, the correct answer is:

**A) \( r = (1, 1, 0) \):** Incorrect, as this does not correspond to the given density matrix.  
**B) \( r = (0, 0, 1) \):** Incorrect, as this represents a pure state along the \( z \)-axis.  
**C) \( r = (0, 0, 0) \):** Correct, as this represents the maximally mixed state.  
**D) \( r = (1, 1, 1) \):** Incorrect, as this does not correspond to the given density matrix.

Thus, the geometrical position of the density matrix in the qubit space is at the origin.

Answer: C
