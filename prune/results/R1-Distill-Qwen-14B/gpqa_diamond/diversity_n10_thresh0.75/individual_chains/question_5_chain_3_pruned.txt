Alright, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to think it through step by step. Okay, the question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n lying in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2.

Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, operators like P are often related to angular momentum. Oh wait, the Pauli matrices are involved here because the components P_x, P_y, P_z are given as ħ/2 times some 2x2 matrices. Right, the Pauli matrices are σ_x, σ_y, σ_z, each multiplied by ħ/2 to form the components of the angular momentum operator S for spin-1/2 particles.

Wait, but in the problem statement, the operator is P, not S. Oh, but for a muon, which is a lepton like an electron, the spin is 1/2, so the Pauli matrices would be applicable. So I think P is the spin operator, and each component is given in terms of Pauli matrices.

The problem asks for the eigenvector of the operator P along a direction n in the x-z plane, with eigenvalue ħ/2. So I need to find the eigenvector of P·n, right? Because the operator along an arbitrary direction is the dot product of the vector operator P with the direction unit vector n.

Wait, the eigenvector equation would be (P·n)|v> = (ħ/2)|v>. So I need to find the eigenvector of the component P·n corresponding to the eigenvalue ħ/2.

First, let's construct the P·n operator. Since n is in the x-z plane, it can be written as (sinθ, 0, cosθ), because n is a unit vector, and for x-z plane, the y-component is zero. So n = (sinθ, 0, cosθ), where θ is the angle from the z-axis.

So, the operator P·n is P_x sinθ + P_z cosθ. Let me write that out.

Given the components:

P_x = (ħ/2) [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
P_y = (ħ/2) [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
P_z = (ħ/2) [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

So P·n = (ħ/2)[ sinθ * [[0,1],[1,0]] + cosθ * [[1,0],[0,-1]] ]

Let me compute that matrix:

= (ħ/2) [ [ cosθ, sinθ ], [ sinθ, -cosθ ] ]

Wait, wait. Let me do it step by step.

First, the sinθ term: [[0,1],[1,0]] multiplied by sinθ gives [[0, sinθ], [sinθ, 0]].

The cosθ term: [[1, 0], [0, -1]] multiplied by cosθ gives [[cosθ, 0], [0, -cosθ]].

Adding them together: [[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ]]

Multiply by ħ/2: that's the P·n matrix.

So P·n = (ħ/2) * [ [ cosθ, sinθ ],
                   [ sinθ, -cosθ ] ]

We need to find the eigenvector of this matrix corresponding to the eigenvalue ħ/2.

So the eigenvalue equation is (P·n - (ħ/2) I) |v> = 0, where I is the identity matrix.

Let me compute P·n minus (ħ/2) I:

= (ħ/2) [ [ cosθ, sinθ ],
           [ sinθ, -cosθ ] ] - (ħ/2) I

= (ħ/2) [ [ cosθ - 1, sinθ ],
           [ sinθ, -cosθ - 1 ] ]

Wait, no: because I is [[1,0],[0,1]], so when multiplied by ħ/2, it's [[ ħ/2, 0 ], [0, ħ/2 ] ].

So subtracting, each element:

Top left: (ħ/2)(cosθ) - (ħ/2)(1) = (ħ/2)(cosθ - 1)
Top right: (ħ/2)(sinθ) - 0 = (ħ/2) sinθ
Bottom left: (ħ/2)(sinθ) -0 = (ħ/2) sinθ
Bottom right: (ħ/2)(-cosθ) - (ħ/2) = (ħ/2)(-cosθ -1 )

So the matrix becomes:

(ħ/2) [ [ cosθ - 1, sinθ ],
         [ sinθ, -cosθ -1 ] ]

We can factor out (ħ/2) from each term, so the matrix equation becomes:

[ [ (cosθ -1), sinθ ],
  [ sinθ, (-cosθ -1) ] ] * [v1; v2] = 0

So the equations are:

(cosθ -1) v1 + sinθ * v2 = 0
sinθ * v1 + (-cosθ -1) v2 = 0

Let me write the first equation as:

(cosθ -1) v1 + sinθ v2 = 0 --> (1)

The second equation:

sinθ v1 + (-cosθ -1) v2 = 0 --> (2)

We can take equation (1) and express v2 in terms of v1.

From equation (1):

sinθ v2 = (1 - cosθ) v1
v2 = [ (1 - cosθ)/sinθ ] v1

But (1 - cosθ) = 2 sin²(theta/2), and sin theta = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2).

So, substituting:

v2 = [ 2 sin²(theta/2) ) / (2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) ) ] v1
= [ sin(theta/2) / cos(theta/2) ) ] v1
= tan(theta/2) v1

So v2 = tan(theta/2) v1.

So the eigenvector can be written as (v1, tan(theta/2) v1). Let me factor out v1:

|v> = v1 [ 1; tan(theta/2) ]

Now, to normalize this vector, compute the norm.

The norm squared is |v1|^2 [1 + tan^2(theta/2)] = |v1|^2 [ sec^2(theta/2) ].

So |v1|^2 * sec^2(theta/2) = |v|^2.

We want |v|^2 to be 1, so |v1|^2 = cos^2(theta/2).

Thus, |v1| = cos(theta/2), and |v2| = sin(theta/2).

Wait, because tan(theta/2) = sin(theta/2)/cos(theta/2), so v2 = [ sin(theta/2)/cos(theta/2) ] v1.

Since v1 is cos(theta/2), then v2 = sin(theta/2).

Wait, let me see:

If |v1| = cos(theta/2), then v1 = cos(theta/2) multiplied by a phase factor (which we can take as real for simplicity, since eigenvectors can be chosen as real in this case). So the normalized eigenvector is:

[ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]

Wait, but let me think again. Because the eigenvector depends on the direction. So the vector is along the direction n in x-z plane. So the state is |+n> = [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]^T.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), but option D is (sqrt(2/3) hbar cos(theta/2), sqrt(1/3) hbar sin(theta/2)).

Wait, wait. Let me look at the options again.

Option C: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2))

Option D: (sqrt(2/3) ħ cos(theta/2), sqrt(1/3) ħ sin(theta/2))

Wait, but in our calculation, the eigenvector components are cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2), but scaled by sqrt(2/3) and sqrt(1/3) respectively? Or did I miss something about the normalization?

Wait, in our case, the eigenvector came out as [1; tan(theta/2)], which after normalization became [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)].

But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the normalization.

Wait, let me recompute the normalization.

The vector is [v1; v2] = [1; tan(theta/2)] * v1, but to find v1, we set the norm to 1.

So |v1|^2 [1 + tan^2(theta/2)] = 1.

But 1 + tan^
