Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a boson. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is about the possible decay channels of a boson X, given a certain interaction Lagrangian and its mass. The mass of X is 6 GeV. The Lagrangian is given as L(y) = -λf f-bar ψf (y)(υ + X(y)) ψf(y). Hmm, wait, maybe I should parse that more carefully.

Wait, the interaction term looks a bit confusing. Let me see. The interaction term is probably something like λ X ψ ψ, meaning that the boson X couples to fermions. So the Lagrangian would involve X interacting with fermion fields. So the interaction term is something like X ψ ψ-bar, which would imply that X can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs.

So the decay of X would produce a pair of fermions. But what fermions are possible? Well, that depends on the mass of X and the masses of the fermions themselves.

The mass of X is 6 GeV. So any fermion pair that X can decay into must have a combined mass less than or equal to 6 GeV. Because in particle physics, the decay products must have a total mass less than the mass of the parent particle (due to energy and conservation laws).

Now, let's list out the possible fermions and their masses. I'm a bit unsure about the exact masses, but I remember approximate values:

- Up quark (u): around 2-5 MeV (so very light)
- Down quark (d): similar, about 3-6 MeV
- Strange quark (s): around 95-100 MeV
- Charm quark (c): about 1.2-1.5 GeV
- Bottom quark (b): about 4.1-4.7 GeV
- Top quark (t): way too heavy, around 173 GeV
- Electron (e): negligible, ~0.0005 GeV
- Muon (μ): around 0.1 GeV
- Tau (τ): about 1.77 GeV
- Neutrinos: even lighter, but they are leptons too, but since the interaction is with ψ (which are fermions, maybe including leptons?), but in this case, the X couples to the ψ, which could be quarks or leptons, depending on the context.

Wait, but the interaction Lagrangian given is written as -λ f f-bar ψ (y) (υ + X(y)) ψf(y). Wait, perhaps the ψ here is a fermion field. So the term is λ X ψ ψ-bar, implying that X couples to any fermion ψ. Or maybe it's a Yukawa coupling type term, where X is a scalar (boson) coupling to fermions.

So X can decay into any fermion-antifermion pair where the sum of their masses is less than or equal to 6 GeV.

Wait, but not all fermions have the same mass. So let's list the possible fermions and see.

Let me list the quarks and leptons with their masses:

Quarks:
- u: ~2 MeV
- d: ~3 MeV
- s: ~100 MeV
- c: ~1.3 GeV
- b: ~4.5 GeV
- t: 173 GeV (way too heavy)

Leptons:
- e: ~0.0005 GeV
- μ: ~0.1 GeV
- τ: ~1.77 GeV
- ν (electron, mu, tau): negligible, but they have mass, though very small. But if X is a boson, could it decay into neutrinos? Well, the decay into neutrinos would require X to have a term coupling to neutrinos. But in the given Lagrangian, perhaps it's only coupling to charged fermions. Not sure. The problem statement doesn't specify; the interaction term seems to involve ψf, which might be a charged fermion. Or perhaps it's just a general fermion.

Wait, the interaction term is written as λ f f-bar X, which would be a Yukawa-like term. Let me think: the term is -λ f (f-bar?) ψf (y) (v + X(y)) ψf(y). Hmm, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the notation. It's a bit unclear. Alternatively, perhaps the interaction is of the form X ψ ψ-bar, meaning that X couples to a fermion-antifermion pair.

In any case, the key is that X can decay into any fermion pair where the sum of the fermion masses is less than 6 GeV. But wait, actually, the mass of the fermion pair is 2m (since a pair is a particle and antiparticle), so for each fermion, 2m must be ≤ 6 GeV.

So let's compute 2m for each fermion:

u: 2 * 2 MeV = 4 MeV < 6 GeV → yes
d: 2 * 3 MeV = 6 MeV < 6 GeV → yes
s: 2 * 100 MeV = 200 MeV = 0.2 GeV → yes
c: 2 * 1.3 GeV = 2.6 GeV → yes (since 2.6 <6)
b: 2 * 4.5 GeV = 9 GeV → 9 >6 → no, can't decay into b b-bar
t: way too heavy, can't decay into t t-bar
e: 2 * 0.0005 GeV → yes
μ: 2 * 0.1 GeV = 0.2 GeV → yes
τ: 2 * 1.77 GeV = 3.54 GeV → yes
neutrinos: 2 * m, but m is negligible, so effectively 0. So X could decay into ν ν-bar, but the problem's options don't include neutrinos, so maybe the interaction doesn't couple to neutrinos.

Wait, but the options given are about X decaying into charged leptons and quarks.

Looking at the options, let's see:

Option A: X→b b-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, τ+τ−, e+e−.

Wait, but the b quark is too heavy because 2m_b is about 9 GeV, which is above 6 GeV. So X can't decay into b b-bar. So Option A includes b, which is not allowed. So A is incorrect.

Option B: X→c c-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, τ+τ−, μ+μ−, e+e−.

Wait, the c quark: 2m_c is 2.6 GeV, which is below 6 GeV. So yes. So c is allowed. So B includes c, which seems okay.

But wait, the mass of X is 6 GeV, so any fermion pair with 2m <6 GeV is allowed.

So let's check each fermion in each option:

Option B includes:

c c-bar: 2.6 GeV → allowed.

s s-bar: 0.2 GeV → allowed.

u u-bar: 0.004 GeV → allowed.

d d-bar: 0.006 GeV → allowed.

τ+ τ-: 3.54 GeV → allowed.

μ+ μ-: 0.2 GeV → allowed.

e+ e-: 0.001 GeV → allowed.

So all these decay modes are allowed. But wait, why does option D include b? Because 2m_b is 9 GeV, which is higher than 6 GeV. So decay to b b-bar is not allowed, so any option including b is wrong.

Option C includes t t-bar, which is impossible, so C is
