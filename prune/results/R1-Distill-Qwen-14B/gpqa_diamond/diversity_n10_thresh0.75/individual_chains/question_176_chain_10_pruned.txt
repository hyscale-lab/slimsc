Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure out the probability of getting specific outcomes when measuring two observables, P and Q, in sequence. Hmm, let's try to break this down step by step.

Alright, the state of the system at time t is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, actually, I think I remember that in quantum mechanics, states are represented as vectors, and they should be normalized. So first, maybe I should check if this state is normalized. To do that, I'll calculate the sum of the squares of the absolute values of each component.

So, the state vector is [-1, 2, 1] as a column. Let's compute the norm squared: (-1)^2 + (2)^2 + (1)^2 = 1 +4 +1 =6. Oh, so the norm is sqrt(6). That means the state isn't normalized. I think I need to normalize it because in quantum mechanics, the state vectors must be normalized (i.e., have a norm of 1). So the actual state vector is probably this divided by sqrt(6). So the normalized state |ψ> is [ -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) ]^T. Right, that makes sense.

Next, the problem mentions two observables, P and Q, each represented by their respective matrices. The first observable P has the matrix:

First row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0
Second row: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)
Third row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0.

Wait, that looks a bit like a symmetric matrix. I wonder if it's Hermitian, which it should be since it's an observable. Let me check: the elements seem to be real, and the matrix is symmetric, so yes, it's Hermitian.

The other observable Q has a diagonal matrix:

First row: 1, 0, 0
Second row: 0, 0, 0
Third row: 0, 0, -1.

That's definitely diagonal, so it's Hermitian too. The eigenvalues for Q are 1, 0, and -1.

The question is about measuring P first, and then Q. But wait, no, the question says someone measures Q just after the measurement of P. Wait, no, wait, no—the question says, if someone measures Q just after the measurement of P. So the order is measure P, then Q. Or is it the other way around? Wait, the wording says "measures Q just after the measurement of P," which I think means first P, then Q.

But wait, no. The question is about measuring P and
