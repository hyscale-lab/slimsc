Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is.

The question involves two reactions using mCPBA followed by aqueous acid. The starting materials are (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene. Then, the products from both reactions are combined and run on two types of HPLC columns: standard (achiral) and chiral. We need to determine how many peaks each chromatogram will show.

Hmm, I remember that mCPBA is meta-chloroperbenzoic acid, which is a peracid. It's commonly used in epoxidation reactions. Epoxidation of alkenes forms an epoxide. So in both Reaction 1 and Reaction 2, the alkenes are reacting with mCPBA to form epoxides, right?

Wait, but the starting alkenes are E and Z isomers. So their structures are different.

Let me think about each reaction separately.

Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene reacts with mCPBA. Since (E) is the trans isomer, when epoxidized, the substituents on either side of the double bond will be trans in the epoxide. So the product would be the trans-epoxide, I think. The structure would have the two CH2CH3 groups on opposite sides of the epoxide ring.

Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene is treated similarly. The Z isomer is the cis one. So when epoxidized, the substituents (like CH2CH3) would be on the same side of the epoxide ring. So that's the cis-epoxide.

Wait, but wait. Oh wait, no. Wait a second. Let me get this straight. The E and Z in the alkene refer to the configuration around the double bond. When you epoxidize with mCPBA, which adds an oxygen across the double bond, the configuration of the substituents in the resulting epoxide depends on the geometry of the starting alkene.

For mCPBA, the reaction forms an epoxide via an electrocyclic ring-opening mechanism, I think. Wait, no, actually, mCPBA adds an oxygen across the double bond, forming an epoxide. The stereochemistry of the starting alkene determines the configuration of the epoxide.

So for an E-alkene (trans), the substituents on each carbon of the double bond
