Okay, so I've got this genetics question here about plant resistance to a fungal disease. Let me try to think through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to work it out.

The question is about three genes, G1, G2, and G3, and their roles in anthracnose resistance in white lupine. They created knockout mutants and double mutants, and tested their resistance. The results are given, and we have to figure out the interactions between these genes.

So, the setup says that at least one of the genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of others. The experiment's results are about how resistant each mutant is compared to the wild type. 100% is the control, meaning the wild type is fully resistant. The lower the percentage, the more susceptible the plant is.

Let me list the results again to make it clear:

- g1: 75% → so, less resistant than wild type but not super susceptible.
- g2: 0% → completely susceptible, so no resistance at all.
- g3: 50% → half the resistance of wild type.
- g1g3: 10% → very susceptible; only 10% resistance.
- g2g3: 0% → same as g2; no resistance.
- g1g2: 0% → no resistance.

Hmm. Let's think about what each of these might mean.

First, I remember that in genetics, when two mutations have a combined effect that's more severe than the sum of their individual effects, it's called epistasis. But in this context, when the double mutant is more severe, it suggests that the two genes are in the same pathway. Or maybe acting in parallel pathways.

Wait, the question mentions that one of the genes is a transcription factor upstream. So transcription factors usually activate other genes. If a transcription factor is knocked out, the downstream genes won't be expressed, leading to a loss of function.

Looking at the mutants:

- The wild type is 100%, so any mutant with lower resistance is less able to resist the disease.

g2 is 0%, so it's completely susceptible. That's a big effect. Maybe this gene is critical. If G2 is a transcription factor, then knocking it out would disable a whole pathway. Because when you have the double mutants including g2 (g1g2, g2g3), they all are 0%, which is the same as g2 alone. That suggests that in both cases, the presence of g2 knockout masks the effect of the other mutations. That could mean that G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3. So, G2 is upstream. Because if G2 is knocked out, the downstream genes (like G1 and G3) can't function properly anyway.

Wait, epistasis is when the phenotype of one mutation masks the effect of another. If G2 is epistatic, then in a double mutant, the phenotype is the same as the g2 mutant
