Okay, so I've got this physics problem about electric potential energy between a charge and a grounded conducting sphere. Hmm, I remember that when dealing with conductors, especially grounded ones, the charges redistribute themselves in a certain way. Let me think through this step by step.

The problem says a charge q is placed at a distance d from the center of a grounded conducting sphere with radius R. I need to find the net potential energy of the system. The options are A to D, all involving expressions with k, q squared, and some combination of d and R.

Wait, right. The conducting sphere being grounded means that any induced charges will adjust until the surface is at zero potential. But how does that affect the potential energy?

I recall that when a charge is placed near a conductor, the conductor's charges redistribute. Since it's grounded, electrons can move in or out. So, the sphere will induce opposite charges on its surface near the charge q, and the same sign charges on the far side. But since it's grounded, the total charge on the sphere remains zero because any excess would be neutralized by the ground.

So, the sphere's induced charge would be such that the potential on its surface is zero. But wait, how does that relate to the potential energy of the system?

Potential energy in electrostatics usually involves the work done to assemble charges. Since the sphere is grounded, maybe I can model it as a point charge at its center or something similar because the potential outside a conducting sphere is the same as that of a point charge at the center.

Oh, right. The method of images! For a grounded conducting sphere, the induced charge can be modeled using an image charge. The image charge technique is used in problems involving spheres and point charges.

Wait, the image charge concept: when a point charge q is placed outside a conducting sphere, the sphere's induced charges can be represented by an image charge inside the sphere. The image charge's position and magnitude are such that the potential due to the real charge and the image charge is zero on the sphere's surface.

So, the image charge q' would be inside the sphere. Let me try to remember the formula for the image charge. I think the image charge for a conducting sphere of radius R when a charge q is at distance d from the center is q' = - (R^2 q)/(d^2 - R^2)^(1/2). Wait, not sure about the exact expression. Alternatively, I think the image charge is q' = - (R^2 q)/(d^2 - R^2)^(1/2) or something like that.

Wait, maybe it's better to think about the potential due to the charge q and the image charge q'. The potential at the surface of the sphere would be zero, so the sum of the potentials from q and q' must be zero. Let's model it.

The potential at a point on the sphere due to q is (kq)/(R) (since q is at distance d from the center, and the point on the sphere is at distance d' from q, but maybe I'm complicating it. Alternatively, using the image charge approach, the potential from q and the image charge q' should cancel on the sphere surface.)

Wait, maybe another approach. The conducting sphere being grounded implies that its potential is zero. The potential at any point on the sphere is the sum of the potentials due to q and the induced charges. But since the sphere is a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium, the potential is the same everywhere on it, and since it's grounded, that potential is zero.

So, the potential at the center of the sphere due to the external charge q is V0 = kq/(d). But wait, that's the potential at the center. The potential at the surface of a sphere is the same as at the center for a uniform sphere? Or is that only for a shell? Hmm, perhaps not. Wait, the conducting sphere's surface is at zero potential because it's grounded.

So, the potential due to the charge q and the induced charges must be zero at the sphere's surface. The induced charges can be represented as an image charge inside the sphere. The image charge q' is located at a distance from the center, let's say r', such that the potential on the surface is zero.

Alternatively, the image charge is determined such that
