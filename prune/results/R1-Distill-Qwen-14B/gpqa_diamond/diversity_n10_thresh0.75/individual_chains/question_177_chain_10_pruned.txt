Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem, and I'm a bit confused, but let's think it through. The question is about the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. 

So, first, what do I remember about luminosity? Luminosity of a star is related to its radius and temperature. The formula I think is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where R is radius, T is temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. Oh right, that's the Stefan-Boltzmann law. So luminosity depends on the square of the radius and the fourth power of the temperature.

The problem says Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. So R1 = 1.5 R2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. Hmm, but wait, how does mass relate here? I'm not sure. Because for main sequence stars, more massive stars are hotter, but does that apply here? The question says to assume they radiate as black bodies, but I'm not sure if mass directly affects their temperature. Let me think. Maybe the mass isn't directly needed here, but perhaps it's a distractor.

The problem states that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, that's the peak wavelength. I remember Wien's Law, which says λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if λ_max is the same for both stars, then their temperatures must be the same. Because λ_max is inversely proportional to T. If λ_max1 = λ_max2, then T1 = T2. Wait, yes, because if λ1 = λ2, then T must be same. So their temperatures are equal.

Wait, but that's confusing because if both stars have the same temperature, but Star_1 is larger in radius, then its luminosity should be higher. So let's calculate the luminosity ratio.

L1 / L2 = (R1² T1⁴) / (R2² T2⁴). Since T1 = T2, this simplifies to (R1² / R2²). R1 is 1.5 R2, so R1/R2 = 1.5. Squared is 2.25. So L1/L2 = 2.25, which would be option A.

Wait, but that's assuming T is same. But the problem says that the peak wavelengths are same, which means T is same. So the luminosity of Star_1 should be 2.25 times Star_2's.

Wait, but the options include A) ~2.25 and D) ~2.23. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Oh wait, the problem also gives radial velocities. Star_1 has radial velocity 0, Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s. How does that affect luminosity?

Wait, no. Luminosity is an intrinsic property. Radial velocity affects the observed brightness through Doppler shift,
