Okay, so I have this question about physics theories and regularization. Hmm, I need to figure out which theory never requires regularization at high energies. Let me think about each option one by one.

Regularization, as I remember, is a technique used in quantum field theories to deal with divergences—like infinities that pop up in calculations. It's a way to make the math work by introducing a cutoff or some other method to handle those infinities before they get too problematic. But some theories don't need this because they're already finite or maybe are classical, so they don't have the same issues.

Option A: Superstring Theory. String theory is a theory of quantum gravity, right? I think it's supposed to be a theory that doesn't have the same divergences as other quantum field theories because strings are one-dimensional and maybe the higher-dimensional aspects help. Or wait, no—wait, I remember that string theory does have some issues with divergences when you calculate loop diagrams. So they might require regularization techniques, like maybe using conformal field theories or other methods. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps superstring theory, being a background-dependent theory, might not need the same kind of regularization as others because it incorporates supersymmetry, which can cancel some divergences. Or maybe it's the opposite, and they still require it. I'm a bit confused here.

Option B: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). QCD is the theory that deals with the strong interaction. I know that QCD has asymptotic freedom, meaning that at high energies (or short distances), the coupling constant becomes weak, so perturbative methods work. But when you go to low energies, it becomes strongly coupled. However, regarding regularization, since QCD is a non-abelian gauge theory, it's a non-supersymmetric theory. Wait, but doesn't QCD require renormalization? Because any quantum field theory with loops will have divergences, right? So yes, QCD does require regularization or renormalization techniques. So this theory does need it, so it's not the answer.

Option C: Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). QED is the theory of electromagnetism, and I've heard it's a renormalizable theory. But does it require regularization? Well, yes. Because when you calculate loop diagrams, like the electron self-energy or photon vacuum polarization, you get divergent integrals. So you have to regularize them, perhaps using a cutoff, dimensional
