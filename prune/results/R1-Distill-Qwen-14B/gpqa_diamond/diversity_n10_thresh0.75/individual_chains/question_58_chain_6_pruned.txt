Okay, so I have this multiple-choice science question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The question is asking which physical theory never requires regularization at high energies. The options are A) Superstring Theory, B) Quantum Chromodynamics, C) Quantum Electrodynamics, D) Classical Electrodynamics.

Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to think it through. So, what's regularization? From what I remember, regularization is a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with divergences, which are infinities that pop up in calculations. These infinities are a problem because they don't give meaningful physical predictions. Regularization introduces a temporary momentum cutoff or some other method to make the integrals finite, and then you remove the cutoff in a way that hopefully gives finite results after renormalization.

Wait, but not all theories require regularization. Maybe some theories are finite, meaning they don't have these divergences in the first place. Or perhaps some theories handle things differently so that regularization isn't necessary?

Looking at the options:

Option D is Classical Electrodynamics. That's the theory of electricity and magnetism at non-quantum levels. Since it's classical, it doesn't involve the renormalization process. But wait, classical theories don't really have the same kinds of infinities as quantum theories do. For example, in classical electromagnetism, you might have issues like the infinite self-energy of a charged point particle, but those are handled differently or are just considered as part of the model. But in a quantum theory context, these things become more problematic, leading to the need for regularization and renormalization.

So quantum theories like QED (option C) and QCD (option B) definitely require regularization because they have loop divergences. For example, in QED, when you calculate the electron self-energy, you get divergent integrals. You need to regularize them, maybe using a cutoff, dimensional regularization, or Pauli-Villars method, and then renormalize by absorbing the infinities into counterterms.

Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) is the theory of the strong interaction. It's a non-abelian gauge theory, similar to QED but with SU(3) symmetry. QCD has asymptotic freedom, meaning
