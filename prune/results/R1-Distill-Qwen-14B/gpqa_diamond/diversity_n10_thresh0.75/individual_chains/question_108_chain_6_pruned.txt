Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about paramagnetic coupling and transition energy in a hydrogen atom. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The question says the magnetic field B is parallel to the Oz axis and has a value of 1 Tesla. They're asking about the order of magnitude comparison between the paramagnetic coupling term and the transition energy ΔE of hydrogen with a wavelength of 0.4861 micrometers.

Wait, first, I should probably remember what these terms mean. The paramagnetic coupling term is related to the interaction between the magnetic moment of an electron and an external magnetic field. The transition energy ΔE is the energy difference between two energy levels in the hydrogen atom, which corresponds to the wavelength given.

Let me jot down the key points:

Magnetic field B = 1 T
Wavelength λ = 0.4861 μm (which is the Balmer series, I think, specifically the H-alpha line. That transition is from n=2 to n=1, but wait, no, wait. Wait, the Balmer series is transitions to n=2. Oh wait, H-alpha is n=3 to n=2, producing a wavelength around 656 nm. Wait, wait, 0.4861 micrometers is 486 nm, which is the Balmer beta line, n=4 to n=2, right? So ΔE is the energy difference for that transition.)

Wait, but maybe for this problem, the exact transition isn't crucial. What matters is the magnitude of ΔE compared to the paramagnetic term.

So, I need to find expressions for both terms.

First, the transition energy ΔE. The energy levels of hydrogen are given by the Rydberg formula. The energy levels are E_n = - (m_e e^4)/(8 ε_0² h²) * (1/(n²)), but I think it's easier to use the relation between energy and wavelength.

The energy of a photon is E = hc/λ. So, let me compute ΔE using that. But wait, for hydrogen transitions, the energy difference between two levels is given by ΔE = E_i - E_f = (hc)/(λ) * (1/(n_i²) - 1/(n_f²)), but maybe in this case, since they're giving the wavelength of the emitted photon, which corresponds to the transition, so Δ
