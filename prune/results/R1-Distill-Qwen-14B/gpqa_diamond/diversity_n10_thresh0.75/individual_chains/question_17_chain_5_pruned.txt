Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, let's see. The problem says there's a 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex, and the pH is ideal. The temperature is 25°C, which I remember is standard, so maybe some constants are known at that temperature. The K for the Ca-EDTA complex is given as 5x10^10.

Wait, wait. Stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. So I think that means the complex has a 1:1 ratio of Ca²+ to EDTA^4- or something like that. Right, because EDTA is a hexadentate ligand and forms complexes with metal ions like Ca²+.

So, the problem is about the dissociation of this complex. The formula should be something like CaY^2- or maybe CaY²+? Not sure, but the main point is that it dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA.

The K for the complex is given as 5e10, which is a very large number. Oh, right, K is the formation constant, which is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. Wait, no, wait. K in this context is probably the dissociation constant. Wait, I might get that mixed up. Let me think. The formation constant Kf is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex from the ions: Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-. So Kf would be [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]).

Alternatively, if K is given as the dissociation constant, then it would be the reverse. Wait, the problem states KCa-EDTA = 5e10. So I think that's the formation constant Kf. Because formation constants are usually large for strong complexes. EDTA forms very stable complexes, so Kf is large, which makes sense.

So, the complex is in solution, let's say it's at 0.02 M concentration. The solution is at stochiometric conditions, which probably means that the initial concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA are equal or something. But wait, the problem says it's a stochiometric solution of the Ca-EDTA complex. So perhaps all the Ca is tied up in the complex, but
