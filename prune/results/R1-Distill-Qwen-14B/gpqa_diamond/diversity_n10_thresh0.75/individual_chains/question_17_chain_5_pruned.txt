Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let's see what it's about.

The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. The solution contains a 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Oh, right, EDTA is a chelating agent, so it binds with metal ions like calcium. The problem gives me the formation constant, K for the Ca-EDTA complex, which is 5x10^10. The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C.

Hmm, I remember that when EDTA forms a complex with a metal ion, the concentration of the free metal ion depends on this formation constant. The formation constant, K, is the equilibrium constant for the reaction where the metal and EDTA combine to form the complex.

So, the reaction would be something like:
Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2−

The formation constant K is given by K = [CaEDTA^2−]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4−])

Wait, but in this solution, the Ca-EDTA complex is already present at 0.02 M. So, initially, I think the concentration of the complex [CaEDTA] is 0.02 M. But the question is asking for the [Ca²+] in the solution.

Assuming that the solution is at equilibrium, most of the EDTA is probably bound to Ca²+ because K is a large number (5e10), which means the reaction favors the product (the complex). So, the free [Ca²+] should be very low.

Let me consider the initial setup. The initial concentration of CaEDTA is 0.02 M. Let's say that some of this complex dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA^4−.

Let me denote the change in [Ca²+] as x. So, at equilibrium, the concentration of Ca²+ is x, and EDTA^4− is also x. Because for each mole of CaEDTA that dissociates, it produces one mole of each ion.

So, the concentration of the complex at equilibrium would be 0.02 - x. But since K is so large, x is going to be very small compared to 0.02, so 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02. That should simplify the calculation.

So plugging into the K expression:

K = [CaEDTA]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4−])

We know K is 5e10, [CaEDTA] is ~0.02, and [Ca²+] and [EDTA] are both x.

So,

5e10 = (0.02) / (x * x)
5e10 = 0.02 / x²

Solving for x²:

x² = 0.02 / (5e10)
x² = 2e-3 / 5e10
Wait, 0.02 is 2e-2, so:

x² = (2e-2) / (5e10) = (2 /5 ) * 1e-12 = 0.4 *1e-12 = 4e-13.

Wait, let me recalculate.

Wait, 2e-2 divided by 5e10 is (2e-2)/(5e10) = (2/5) * 1e-12 = 0.4 *1e-12 = 4e-13.

So x² = 4e-13 → x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5 → Wait, sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5?

Wait, 4e-13 is 4 * 10^-13. The square root of 4 is 2, and sqrt(10^-13) is 10^(-13/2) = 10^-6.5. So x is 2e-6.5 M.

Wait, 10^-6.5 is about 3.16e
