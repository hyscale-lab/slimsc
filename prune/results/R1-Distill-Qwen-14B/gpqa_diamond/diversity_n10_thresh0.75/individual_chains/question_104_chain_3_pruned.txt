Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, let me think through what I remember about how the RV method works.

So, the RV method detects planets by measuring the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum as the planet orbits, causing the star to move back and forth. The shift in the spectral lines gives information about the star's velocity towards or away from us. The bigger the shift, the more massive the planet, because a more massive planet would cause the star to move more.

The question says that two stars with the same mass each have a planet with masses similar to Neptune. So both stars have the same mass, and the planets have similar masses. Both planets are in circular orbits, so Kepler's laws should apply here.

The problem gives the periodic shift in wavelength for each star. For planet #1, it's 5 milliangstroms, and for planet #2, it's 7 milliangstroms. Wait, but how does this relate to the orbital period? Oh right, the RV method measures the velocity of the star, which is related to the mass of the planet and the orbital period.

I remember that the formula for the semi-amplitude of the radial velocity (K) is given by:

K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) ) )^(1/3) ) / (2π)

Wait, maybe I should think about the formula more carefully. Alternatively, another approach is to consider that the velocity semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_p / M_star) * (P)^(−1/3) ), assuming that M_p << M_star, which is true for planets around stars. Because the planet mass is much less than the star, M_star + M_p ≈ M_star.

So, K is proportional to (M_p) / (M_star^(2/3) * P^(1/3) )

Wait, maybe I should write the exact formula. The formula for K is:

K = [ (G * P ) / (2 * π * c^3) ) ]^(1/3) * ( M_p sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) )

But since M_p is much less than M_star, M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. So this simplifies to:

K ≈ [ (G * P ) / (2 *
