Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

So the setup is that there are two stars, both with the same mass as the Sun. Each has a planet, both similar to Neptune in mass. So, same host star masses, same planet masses. Both planets are in circular orbits, which is good because that avoids complications from eccentric orbits.

The question is about the orbital periods of the two planets. They're detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. The RV method measures the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravitational pull. The shift in the spectral lines tells us about the star's velocity moving towards or away from us.

Planet #1 causes a shift of 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2 causes a shift of 7 milliangstroms. I need to find out how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1.

Wait, so I remember that the RV method depends on the mass of the planet, the orbital period, and the inclination of the orbit. But since both are detected, I guess the inclination must be such that we can see the shift. So I can probably ignore the inclination factor since it's the same for both planets (or maybe it's assumed to be edge-on, but I'm not sure).

The formula I think is relevant here is the one for the semi-amplitude of the radial velocity, K. The formula is something like K = (V) = ( (G * (M_planet) ) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) ) ) ) * (1 / (P * (1 - e²)^(0.5)) )) )^(1/3) or something like that. Wait, maybe I should look up the exact formula.

Wait, more accurately, the RV semi-amplitude K is given by the formula:

K = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) ) ] * [ (1) / (P^(1/3) * (1 - e^2)^(0.5)) ) ] / c

But wait, M_p is much smaller than M_*, since planets are much less massive than stars. So M_* + M_p ≈ M_*.
