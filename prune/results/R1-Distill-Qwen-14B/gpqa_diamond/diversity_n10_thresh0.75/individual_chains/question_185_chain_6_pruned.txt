Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. The question is about finding the eigenvalues of a Hamiltonian operator. Hmm, I remember that eigenvalues are crucial because they tell us the possible energy levels a system can have.

The Hamiltonian given is H = ε σ · n. Oh wait, σ is the Pauli vector, right? So σ · n would be the dot product of sigma and the unit vector n. And ε is an energy constant. 

Wait, the σ vector is made up of Pauli matrices. So σ · n would be a 2x2 matrix where each component is multiplied by the corresponding component of n. Since n is a unit vector, the sum of squares of its components should be 1. But when you expand σ · n, it's like n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z.

I think the Pauli matrices are each 2x2 matrices. So σ · n is a 2x2 matrix, and H is also a 2x2 matrix. To find the eigenvalues, I can find the trace and determinant, maybe.

Wait, another approach: for any 2x2 matrix of the form aσ · n, the eigenvalues are ±a. Because the Pauli matrices are traceless and have eigenvalues ±1. Oh wait, but wait, let's think this through more carefully.

Each Pauli matrix σ_i (like σ_x, σ_y, σ_z) has eigenvalues +1 and -1. But when you have a linear combination like n · σ, which is a sum of the Pauli matrices multiplied by components of n, the eigenvalues of that matrix should be ±1. Because any such matrix is a unit vector multiplied by the Pauli vector, which results in a matrix whose eigenvalues are ±1. Because n is a unit vector, the matrix σ · n is Hermitian and traceless, so it's similar to the Pauli matrices.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. The matrix σ · n is a Hermitian matrix because each Pauli matrix is Hermitian and n is real. The trace of σ · n is zero because each Pauli matrix has trace zero, and n
