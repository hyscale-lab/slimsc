Okay, so I've got this question about qPCR and calibration curves. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

So, the scientist is making a calibration curve for qPCR. He used a positive control with known copy numbers and ran it on serially diluted samples with three technical replicates each. The efficiency is 100%, which I think means it's perfect, right? So the PCR is working perfectly. R squared is 1, which is a perfect correlation, meaning the data points fit the curve perfectly. The slope is -3.3. Hmm, I remember that the slope in a qPCR calibration curve is related to the efficiency. Oh wait, the formula is usually slope = -3.32 divided by efficiency, but since efficiency is 100%, that's 1, so -3.32 is expected. Oh wait, the given slope is -3.3, which is close enough, considering maybe rounding or something.

The results show the Ct values for each concentration. Let's see:

100,000 copies: 33.9, 34.2, 34.5 → average maybe ~34.2
10,000: 30.6, 30.9, 31.2 → average ~31
1,000: 27.3, 27.6, 27.9 → ~27.6
100: 24, 24.3, 24.6 → ~24.3
10: 20.7, 21, 21.3 → ~21

Wait, but the Ct values are higher (meaning more cycles needed) for lower concentrations. Oh wait, no, higher concentration should mean more copies, so you reach the threshold faster, lower Ct. Right, because if you have more copies, it takes fewer cycles to reach the detection threshold. So 100,000 copies have a higher Ct (34) than 10 copies (20.7). That makes sense.

The question is asking why there are discrepancies in his results. The options are
