Okay, so I have this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, the question says to assume stars are uniformly distributed. I remember that when things are uniformly distributed, their density is constant. But wait, how does that apply to stars and their parallax?

Parallax, plx, is a measure of distance. I think the formula is distance d ≈ 1/plx, or maybe it's d = 1/(plx * some constant). Oh right, the parsec is the unit where 1 parsec is the distance at which 1 AU subtends 1 arcsecond. So parallax plx (in arcseconds) is 1/d (in parsecs). So d = 1/plx.

Now, the question is asking how the number of stars per unit range of plx changes with plx. So, it's about the number density as a function of parallax. Since stars are uniformly distributed, their actual number density in space is constant. That means the number of stars per unit volume is the same everywhere.

Wait, but we're looking at the number of stars in a certain range of parallax. Parallax is inversely proportional to distance. So for a given range of plx, how does that translate into volume?

The volume of a spherical shell at distance d with thickness dr is approximately 4πd² dr. But since d = 1/plx, we can express dr in terms of plx. Let's see.

Let me relate plx and distance. plx = 1/d. So, if I have a small change in plx, dplx, that relates to dr as
