Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about stars and their distribution in the sky, specifically how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says stars are uniformly distributed, which I think means they're spread out evenly in all directions. Parallax is a measure of distance; the closer a star is, the higher its parallax. Oh wait, no, wait. Actually, parallax is inversely related to distance. So a higher parallax means a closer star. Right, because parallax is the apparent shift in position when viewed from two points. So the formula is distance (in parsecs) is 1 over parallax (in arcseconds).

So the problem is asking how the number of stars per unit parallax interval (like, say, from plx to plx + dplx) depends on plx. So we're looking for N ∝ something with plx.

I remember that in a uniform distribution of stars, the number of stars in a certain volume depends on the volume. So if stars are uniformly distributed, the number density is constant. But how does the volume change with parallax?

Let me think about the volume of space that would correspond to a range of parallaxes. Suppose we're looking at stars with parallax between plx and plx + dplx. Since parallax plx is 1/distance, so distance is 1/plx. But wait, when plx increases, the distance decreases. So small plx means far away stars.

So the volume of space between two spheres (radius 1/plx and 1/(plx + dplx)) would give the volume where stars with that parallax range reside. Wait, no, actually, the volume element in spherical coordinates is 4πr² dr. So the number of stars in a thin shell between r and r+dr is proportional to the surface area (4πr²) times dr, multiplied by the number density (which is constant here).

So if we express everything in terms of parallax, since plx = 1/r, dr = - (dplx)/(r²) * r^2? Wait, maybe I should express it in terms of plx.

Let me see, r = 1/plx. So dr = - (1/plx²) dplx. Hmm, let's see. The volume element in terms of r is 4π r² dr.
