Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about synthesizing a specific compound from ethynylcyclohexane using a series of reagents. Let me break it down.

The target molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me visualize it. So, the main structure is a cyclohexane ring. On carbon 1 of this ring, there's a substituent which is a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH2OH (since hydroxy methyl is -CH2OH). Also, on the same carbon, there's an aldehyde group (-CHO). Wait, no, wait. Let me correct that. The formula would be something like cyclohexane with a substituent that's a cyclohexyl group connected to a CH2OH group and also an aldehyde. Or perhaps, the substituent is a CH2 group that's connected to both a cyclohexyl and a hydroxyl group, and that same carbon also has the aldehyde.

Wait, maybe I'm getting that wrong. Let me parse the name again. 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So, the main chain is cyclohexane carbaldehyde, meaning the aldehyde is at position 1. And at position 1, there's a substituent which is a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group. So, the structure is a cyclohexane ring with an aldehyde group on carbon 1. Attached to that same carbon is a CH2 group which is connected to a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group. So, the structure would be:

Cyclohexane ring with a -CHO on C1 and a CH2(OH)(cyclohexyl) group also on C1. So, the substituent on C1 is a CH2OH that's attached to a cyclohexyl group. Or wait, no: the substituent is cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl, which is CH2OH with a cyclohexyl group attached to the same carbon? No, wait, the substituent is a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH2OH, but that's all on the same carbon as the aldehyde.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a methyl group (CH2-) that is connected to both a hydroxyl group and a cyclohexyl group. So, it's a geminal diol? No, wait, because hydroxy is -OH. Wait, perhaps it's a CH2 group attached to both a cyclohexyl and a hydroxyl. So, the structure would look like:

The cyclohexane ring has a -CHO group on carbon 1. The same carbon has a CH2 group that's attached to both a cyclohexyl (cyclohexane) group and a hydroxyl (-OH) group. So, the substituent is CH2(OH)(cyclohexyl).

So, the target is:

On the cyclohexane ring, at position 1, there's a -CHO group and a CH
