Okay, so I've got this question about molecular biology, specifically dealing with transgenic mice and gene expression. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The scenario is that someone is trying to create a transgenic mouse model where GADD45G is overexpressed. They added a hemagglutinin (HA) tag at the N-terminus of the protein. They used Lipofectamine to transfect Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells with the plasmid, but when they tested the expression, they couldn't overexpress the protein as expected. They looked at the plus strand sequence and noticed something wrong.

The options are A to D. So I need to figure out what's wrong with the sequence provided.

First, let me think about how a coding sequence works. The coding sequence is in the mRNA, which is synthesized from the template (minus) strand. The plus strand is the same as the mRNA, except T instead of U. So the given sequence is the coding (sense) strand.

Looking at the sequence, the HA tag is supposed to be at the N-terminus. HA is a small peptide derived from influenza virus. Its sequence is usually around YPYDHHQRTG (or something similar) but the exact amino acids might vary. But wait, the question says the HA is added as a sequence in the coding DNA. So the construct should have the HA tag's DNA sequence before the GADD45G coding sequence.

Wait, but looking at the sequence given, I don't immediately see the HA tag's DNA sequence. Hmmm. Alternatively, perhaps the HA tag's sequence is not included in the provided plus strand, which would be a problem. Because if the HA tag isn't present, then the construct might not be expressed correctly. Or perhaps the HA is there but in the wrong reading frame.

Wait, but the question says they introduced the HA sequence. So maybe the problem is in the sequence of the HA tag. Let me think about the structure.

Another possibility is that the HA tag is present but in the wrong reading frame, leading to a frameshift. Alternatively, maybe the HA tag's sequence is correct, but perhaps there's a stop codon introduced.

Wait, the user says that when they look at the plus strand, the sequence reads a
