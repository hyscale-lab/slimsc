Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonances and their decay distances. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question gives me some parameters: production energy E_X is 8 GeV, mass m_X is 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X is 320 MeV. I need to find the mean decay distance, and the options are all in the order of 1e-15 to 1e-16 meters. 

Wait, I remember that the mean decay distance (also called the decay length) depends on the particle's lifetime and its velocity. The formula I think is something like decay distance L = c * τ * β, where c is the speed of light, τ is the proper lifetime, and β is the velocity over the speed of light (v/c).

But how do I find τ? Oh right, the mean lifetime τ is related to the width Γ by the uncertainty principle. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle says that ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2. For a particle, the width Γ is like the uncertainty in energy, so ΔE ≈ Γ. Therefore, τ ≈ ħ/(Γ). Wait, no, correction: the relation is Γ = ħ/τ. So τ = ħ / Γ. Because Γ is the total decay width, which is inversely proportional to the mean lifetime.

So first, I need to calculate τ. But wait, I have to be careful with units. Let's make sure everything is in SI units.
