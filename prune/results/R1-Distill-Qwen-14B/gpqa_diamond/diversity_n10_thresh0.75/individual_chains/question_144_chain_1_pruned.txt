Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The question is asking for the mean decay distance of a meson X. They gave me the production energy E_X as 8 GeV, the mass m_X as 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X as 320 MeV. The options are A to D with various distances in meters, so I need to calculate which one is correct.

Wait, what do I remember about particle decay? I think the mean lifetime is related to the width. Oh right, the width Γ is related to the particle's lifetime τ by the uncertainty principle. The formula is τ = ħ / Γ, right? But wait, what's the exact formula? Oh, Γ is the decay width, which is the total energy uncertainty. So yes, τ is ħ divided by Γ.

But wait, the question is about the mean decay distance, not the lifetime. Oh right, the decay distance (cτ) would be the speed of light multiplied by the lifetime. So the formula should be cτ = c * ħ / Γ. So the mean decay distance is (c * ħ) / Γ.

Wait, but I have to make sure about the units. Let me jot that down.

First, let's get all the constants and values in the right units.

Constants:
- ħ (h-bar) is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. Oh wait, is that correct? I think ħ is 197.3 MeV·fm (since 1 GeV is 1000 MeV and 1 fm is 1e-15 meters). Wait, maybe I should convert everything into consistent units.

Alternatively, ħ = 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. Yeah, that's a common value used in particle physics.

But I also remember that in natural units (GeV and seconds), c is approximately 3 × 10^8 m/s, but I might need to convert that when dealing with GeV and meters.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute using c in m/s and ħ in J·s. Let me think: Planck constant h is 6.626 × 10^-34 J·s. So ħ is h/(2π) ≈ 1.0545718 × 10^-34 J·s. But when working with GeV, which is energy, I need to convert that into joules.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the conversion factors involving eV. 1 eV = 1.602 × 10^-19 J. And 1 GeV is 1e9 eV.

Hmm, maybe a better approach is to compute using units where everything is in terms of GeV and meters. Let me see.

So, the formula for the decay length is c * τ, where τ is the lifetime. And τ is ħ / Γ. So putting it together:

Decay length L = c * (ħ / Γ)

But I need to get all the units right. Let's compute each part.

First, compute ħ in GeV·s. As I remember, ħ ≈ 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s.

c is the speed of light, approximately 3 × 10^8 m/s.

Γ is given as 320 MeV. Wait, that's 0.32 GeV because 1 GeV is 1000 MeV. So Γ = 0.32 GeV.

Now, putting the numbers in:

L = (3e8 m/s) * (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV)

Wait, the GeV unit cancels out, so:

L = (3e8) * (6.582e-25 / 0.32) meters.

Let me compute 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32.
