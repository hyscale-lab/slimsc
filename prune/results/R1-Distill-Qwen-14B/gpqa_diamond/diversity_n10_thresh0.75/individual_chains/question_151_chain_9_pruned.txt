Alright, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Let me try to work through it step by step. Okay, the question is about finding the probability of measuring a certain observable, P, and getting zero. Hmm, I remember from my notes that observables correspond to Hermitian matrices, and when you measure an observable, the possible outcomes are its eigenvalues. So the first thing I should probably do is find the eigenvalues of matrix P because those will give me the possible results of the measurement.

Wait, the matrix P is given as a 3x3 matrix. Let me write it down. The first row is [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0], the second row is [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)], and the third row is [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]. So P looks like this:

0      1/√2      0
1/√2   0       1/√2
0      1/√2     0

Hmm, I wonder if this matrix has any symmetries or patterns that can help me find its eigenvalues more easily. Like, perhaps it's a symmetric matrix, which it is, so that's good because Hermitian matrices are symmetric (or more generally, equal to their conjugate transpose, but since all elements are real here, symmetric is sufficient).

Eigenvalues are solutions to the characteristic equation det(P - λI) = 0. Let me set up that determinant.

So, the matrix P minus λ times the identity matrix would be:

[-λ      1/√2      0     ]
[1/√2   -λ       1/√2   ]
[0      1/√2    -λ     ]

The determinant of this matrix needs to be zero. Calculating the determinant for a 3x3 is a bit involved, but maybe I can expand it.

The determinant is calculated as:

-λ * [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) ) ] - (1/√2) * [ (1/√2)(-λ) - (0)(0) ) ] + 0 * [ ... ].

Wait, the third term is multiplied by zero, so it disappears. Let me compute each part.

First term: -λ times (λ² - (1/2)), because (1/√2)^2 is 1/2.

Second term: minus (1/√2) times [ (-λ/√2) - 0 ] → which is (1/√2) * (λ/√2) → λ/2.

So putting it together:

-λ (λ² - 0.5) - (1/√2) * (-λ/√2) ) → Wait wait, no, the sign. The second term is - (1/√2) * [ (1/√2)(-λ) ] → so let me re-express.

Wait, expanding the determinant formula:

The determinant is:

P(1,1) * (P(2,2)*P(3,3) - P(2,3)*P(3,2)) - P(1,2) * (P(2,1)*P(3,3) - P(2,3)*P(3,1)) + P(1,3) * (P(2,1)*P(3,2) - P(2,2)*P(3,1)).

So plugging in:

-λ * [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) ) ] - (1/√2) * [ (1/√2)(-λ) - (1/√2)(0) ) ] + 0 * [ ... ].

So first term: -λ*(λ² - (1/2)).

Second term: - (1/√2) * [ (-λ/√2 ) ] → which is (1/√2)*(λ/√2) = λ/(2).

Third term is zero.

So the entire determinant is:

-λ(λ² - 1/2) + λ/2.

Let me distribute the first term:

-λ³ + (λ/2) + λ/2 = -λ³ + λ.

So the equation is:

-λ³ + λ = 0 → λ ( -λ² + 1 ) = 0.

So the solutions are:

λ = 0, or -λ² +1 =0 → λ²=1 → λ=1 or λ=-1.

So the eigenvalues are 0, 1, and -1. So when we measure the observable P, the possible outcomes are 0, 1, and -1. But the question is about the probability of getting 0.

Wait, but in quantum mechanics, the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues of the operator. So yes, 0 is an eigenvalue. So to find the probability of measuring 0, I need to find the eigenvector corresponding to λ=0, and then compute the inner product of the state vector with this eigenvector.

Wait, the state vector is given as a column matrix (-1, 2, 1). Let me write that as a vector v = [-1, 2, 1]^T.

So first, find the eigenvectors for λ=0.

So (P - 0 * I) v = 0 → P v = 0.

So let me write down the equations:

Row 1: 0*v1 + (1/√2) v2 + 0*v3 = 0 → (1/√2) v2 = 0 → v2=0.

Row 2: (1/√2) v1 + 0*v2 + (1/√2) v3 = 0 → (1/√2)(v1 + v3) = 0 → v1 = -v3.

Row 3: 0*v1 + (1/√2) v2 + 0*v3 = 0 → again, v2=0.

So from row 1: v2=0.

From row 2: v1 = -v3.

So the eigenvectors are of the form [v3, 0, -v3]^T.

So let me choose v3 = a, so the eigenvector is a*(1, 0, -1)^T, where a is a scalar.

So the eigenvectors for λ=0 are scalar multiples of (1,
