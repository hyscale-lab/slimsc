Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a spin-1/2 particle and magnetic fields. Hmm, let me think through what's going on.

So, the setup is this: there's a particle with spin 1/2, and it has a magnetic moment mu which is gamma times Sz. Oh wait, right, gamma is the gyromagnetic ratio. The magnetic moment is aligned with a magnetic field pointing in the +Z direction. Then, suddenly, that field is turned off, and another one is turned on along the +Y direction. Both fields have the same magnitude, B. The question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment.

I remember that when a magnetic moment is placed in a magnetic field, it experiences a torque, which causes it to precess. But in this case, the field changes direction, so maybe the precession changes too.

Wait, when the magnetic field is along +Z, the particle's magnetic moment (mu) is aligned with it. So initially, the state is an eigenstate of Sz, right? Because mu is along Z, so the energy is lowest or something. 

But then the field is turned off and another one is turned on along Y. So the new Hamiltonian will involve the magnetic field along Y. Let's think about the Hamiltonian.

The Hamiltonian for a magnetic moment in a magnetic field is H = -mu·B. Oh wait, but in this case, mu is given as gamma*Sz. So H would be -gamma*Sz*B. Wait, no, because when the field is along Z, that's straightforward. But when the field is along Y, that would be H = -gamma * S_y * B. Or wait, perhaps I should be careful with directions.

Wait, no. The magnetic moment mu is given as gamma * S_z. Hmm, wait, that might not be right. Wait, the magnetic moment for a spin-1/2 particle is usually mu = gamma * S, where S is the spin operator. So if the magnetic moment is aligned along the direction of the spin. Wait, the problem says mu = gamma * Sz. Oh, so mu is along the z-direction, regardless of the magnetic field's direction? That seems a bit confusing. Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe the initial mu is along +Z because the initial field is along +Z. But when the field changes, the mu's direction would change? Wait, no, the spin is fixed, but the magnetic field's direction changes. Or perhaps mu is a vector that's aligned with the spin direction, which is now precessing under the new field.

Wait, maybe I should model this using the Hamiltonian. The initial setup: magnetic field B along +Z. So H_initial is proportional to Sz. But when the field is suddenly switched to +Y, the Hamiltonian becomes proportional to Sy. Oh wait, no, because the magnetic field is along Y, so the Hamiltonian should involve Sy. Because H = -mu·B. So if B is along Y, then H = -gamma * S_y * B.

Wait, but the magnetic moment mu is given as gamma * Sz. Hmmm, that might not make sense. Or perhaps mu is aligned along the direction of the spin, which is in the initial state along +Z, so mu points along +Z. But when the field switches, the Hamiltonian becomes proportional to Sy.

Wait, perhaps I should think of this as a spin-1/2 system in a magnetic field. The energy levels depend on the component of spin along the field direction.

So initially, the particle is in an eigenstate of Sz, say |+z>, because the magnetic field is along Z. So the initial state is |+z>.

Then the field is turned off (so maybe the Hamiltonian becomes zero for an instant?), but then another field along Y is turned on. So the new Hamiltonian is H = gamma * B * Sy. Or wait, wait. The standard expression is H = -gamma * B · S. Because the energy is proportional to the dot product of the magnetic moment and the field. So if mu is gamma * S (not Sz), then H = -gamma * B · S. So when B is along Y, it's H = -gamma * B * Sy.

Wait, but the question states mu = gamma * Sz. That's confusing. Because if mu is only in the z-direction, then when the field is along Y, the interaction would be different. Maybe I'm getting that wrong.

Wait, maybe the magnetic moment is mu = gamma * S, where S is the vector, so it's mu = gamma (Sx, Sy, Sz). So the magnetic moment vector points in the same direction as the spin. So when the field is along +Z, mu is along +Z, so the energy is proportional to Sz. But when the field is turned to Y, the magnetic moment will interact with the Y-direction field.

Wait, but the problem states mu = gamma * Sz. Oh, that's different. So mu is only in the z-direction. Hmm. So when the field is along Y, the magnetic moment is along Z. So the dot product would be mu·B = gamma * Sz * B, but since B is along Y, Sz is perpendicular to B. So mu·B would be zero. Wait, but that can't be right because the particle's moment would not precess if the torque is zero.

Wait a second, maybe I misread the question. Let me check again. The magnetic moment is mu = gamma * Sz. Oh wait, that's only the z-component of the magnetic moment. So mu_z = gamma * S_z. So the magnetic moment in other directions (like Y or X) would be zero. But when the field is along Y, the torque would cause the spin to precess around Y, but since mu is along Z, the torque would cause a change in the direction of mu.

Wait, but then the magnetic moment is fixed in the Z direction? That seems odd. Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding; maybe mu is a vector that's proportional to the spin vector. So mu = gamma * S, not just Sz.

Ah, perhaps the question has a typo, but I'll proceed with what's given.

Alternatively, perhaps mu is the magnitude of the magnetic moment, and the direction is determined by the spin direction. So mu is a vector in the same direction as the spin. So when the spin is in a state along Z, mu is along Z. When the spin precesses under the Y field, mu would change direction accordingly.

Wait, but the question says mu = gamma * Sz. So perhaps mu is a vector where only the z-component is non-zero. So mu_x and mu_y are zero, and mu_z = gamma * S_z. So when the magnetic field is along Y, the dot product mu · B would be mu_z * B_y (since B is along Y), but since mu_z is non-zero and B_y is along Y, the dot product would be zero. That can't be right because then there wouldn't be any torque or energy, and the magnetic moment wouldn't change.

Hmm, that doesn't make sense. So perhaps I've misinterpreted the problem. Let me re-read it.

The problem says: "a spin 1/2 particle with magnetic moment mu (= gamma*Sz), aligned with a magnetic field pointing in the +Z direction."

Ah, so mu is equal to gamma times Sz. So mu is a vector in the z-direction, because Sz is the spin in z-direction. So the magnetic moment is along z. So when the field is in z, it's aligned.

But when the field is turned to Y, the magnetic moment is still along Z. So the torque would cause the spin to precess, but since the magnetic moment is along Z, perhaps the dynamics are different.

Wait, torque is given by mu × B. So when the field is in Y, the torque would be mu × B. Since mu is along Z and B is along Y, the cross product would be in the X direction.

But torque is the rate of change of angular momentum. So in this case, the spin angular momentum (proportional to S) would start changing direction. So when the field is along Y, the torque would cause the spin to precess around Y, but since the magnetic moment is along Z, this might affect how the expectation value of Sz oscillates.

Wait, but the question asks about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment. So perhaps the average <Sz> starts oscillating in time.

Let me think about the time evolution. Initially, the particle is in the |+z> state. After the field is switched, the Hamiltonian becomes H = - mu · B. But mu is along Z, and B is along Y. So mu · B = mu_z * B_y. But since mu is along Z and B is along Y, mu_z is gamma * S_z, and B_y is B. So mu · B = gamma * S_z * B. Wait, but that would be zero except for states where S_z is non-zero. Hmm, perhaps not.

Wait, no. Wait, mu is a vector; mu = (0, 0, gamma S_z), and B is (0, B, 0). So the dot product is (0)(0) + (0)(B) + (gamma S_z)(0) = 0. So the dot product is zero. That can't be right because that would imply no interaction, which doesn't make sense.

Wait, I must have made a mistake in interpreting mu and the field.

Alternatively, perhaps the magnetic moment is mu = gamma * S, a vector. Then, when the field is along Y, the Hamiltonian is H = -gamma * B * Sy. Because H = -mu · B = -gamma (Sx*0 + Sy*B + Sz*0) = -gamma B Sy.

That makes sense. So in that case, when the field is along Y, the Hamiltonian is proportional to Sy. So the system's energy levels will depend on Sy.

So the initial state is |+z>, which is an eigenstate of Sz. But when the Hamiltonian becomes proportional to Sy, the state will evolve in time under the influence of this Hamiltonian.

The time evolution is given by the Schrödinger equation. The energy eigenstates of H are the eigenstates of Sy. The eigenvalues of Sy are ± ħ/2. So the energy levels are E_+ = (gamma B) * (ħ/2), E_- = -(gamma B) * (ħ/2). Or wait, wait, H = -gamma B Sy, so E = -gamma B (± ħ/2 ), which is ± gamma B ħ/2.

Wait, no, the eigenvalues for Sy are ± ħ/2. So H = -gamma B Sy. So the eigenvalues are -gamma B (± ħ/2 ), which simplifies to ± (gamma B ħ/2) multiplied by -1. So E_+ = (-gamma B) (ħ/2 ), E_- = (gamma B) (ħ/2 ).

Wait, no, let me compute this again. Let me think about the operator Sy. The eigenvalues of Sy are ± ħ/2. So when you have H = -gamma B Sy, each eigenstate |+y> or |-y> will have energies E = -gamma B * (± ħ/2 ), which gives E = ± (gamma B ħ/2 ) multiplied by (-1) [Wait, no: E = -gamma B * (value of Sy) ].

Wait, Sy |+y> = (ħ/2) |+y>, so H |+y> = -gamma B (ħ/2) |+y> → E_+ = - (gamma B ħ/2 )

Similarly, Sy |-y> = - (ħ/2) |-y>, so H |-y> = gamma B (ħ/2) |-y> → E_- = (gamma B ħ/2 )

Wait, that's a bit confusing. Alternatively, perhaps I should write E_+ = -gamma B (ħ/2 ), E_- = +gamma B (ħ/2 ), or something like that.

In any case, the time evolution of the system will involve transitions between the eigenstates of Sy, which are |+y> and |-y>.

But the initial state is |+z>. So let's express |+z> in terms of |+y> and |-y>.

The states |+x>, |−x>, |+y>, |−y> can be expressed in terms of |+z> and |−z>.

The |+y> state is (|+z> + |−z> ) / sqrt(2), and |-y> is (|+z> - |−z> ) / sqrt(2).

So, |+z> = (|+y> + |−y> ) / sqrt(2).

So the initial state can be written as (|+y> + |−y> ) / sqrt(2).

The time evolution of each eigenstate is given by a phase factor. So each component will evolve as e^(-i E t / ħ ).

So |+y> → e^(-i E_+ t/ħ ) |+y>, and |-y> → e^(-i E_- t/ħ ) |-y>.

So the state at time t is [ e^(-i E_+ t/ħ ) |+y> + e^(-i E_- t/ħ ) |-y> ] / sqrt(2).

But E_+ = -gamma B (ħ/2 ), so E_+ t/ħ = [ -gamma B (ħ/2 ) * t ] / ħ = -gamma B t / 2.

Similarly, E_- = gamma B (ħ/2 ), so E_- t/ħ = gamma B t / 2.

So the state becomes [ e^{i (gamma B t / 2 ) } |+y> + e^{ -i (gamma B t / 2 ) } |-y> ] / sqrt(2).

Wait, because E_+ was negative, so the exponent is (-i E_+ t / ħ ) = (-i)(-gamma B (ħ/2 ) t ) / ħ ) = i gamma B t / 2.

Similarly for E_-.

So substituting, the state becomes [ e^{i (gamma B t/2)} |+y> + e^{-i (gamma B t/2 )} |-y> ] / sqrt(2).

Now, let me express this back in terms of |+z> and |−z>:

|+y> = (|+z> + |−z> ) / sqrt(2)
|-y> = (|+z> - |−z> ) / sqrt(2)

So substituting:

[ e^{i (gamma B t/2)} (|+z> + |−z> ) / sqrt(2) + e^{-i (gamma B t/2)} (|+z> - |−z> ) / sqrt(2) ] / sqrt(2)

Factor out 1/sqrt(2):

(1/sqrt(2)) [ e^{i theta} (|+z> + |−z> ) + e^{-i theta} (|+z> - |−z> ) ] / sqrt(2)

Where theta = gamma B t /2.

Wait, wait, the denominator is sqrt(2) from the expansion, and another sqrt(2) comes from the 1/sqrt(2) factor, so overall 1/2.

So,

[ e^{i theta} (|+z> + |−z> ) + e^{-i theta} (|+z> - |−z> ) ] / 2

Let me expand this:

= [ (e^{i theta} + e^{-i theta}) |+z> + (e^{i theta} - e^{-i theta}) |−z> ] / 2

We know that e^{i theta} + e^{-i theta} = 2 cos theta, and e^{i theta} - e^{-i theta} = 2i sin theta.

So substituting:

= [ 2 cos theta |+z> + 2i sin theta |−z> ] /2 

= cos theta |+z> + i sin theta |−z>

So the state at time t is:

|psi(t)> = cos(theta) |+z> + i sin(theta) |−z>

Where theta = (gamma B /2 ) t

Wait, no, theta is gamma B t / 2. Because earlier we set theta = gamma B t/2.

So, the state is:

cos( (gamma B t/2) ) |+z> + i sin( (gamma B t/2) ) |−z>

Now, the expectation value of S_z is <Sz> = <psi(t)| S_z |psi(t)>

The spin operator S_z has eigenvalues +ħ/2 for |+z> and -ħ/2 for |−z>.

So,

<S_z> = [ cos(theta) ]^2 (ħ/2 ) + [i sin(theta)]^2 ( - ħ/2 )

But [i sin(theta)]^2 = (i^2)(sin^2 theta ) = (-1) sin^2 theta.

So,

<S_z> = (cos^2 theta)(ħ/2) + (- sin^2 theta)(- ħ/2 )

Wait, because the second term is (i sin theta)^2 times (-ħ/2 ), which is (- sin^2 theta) * (- ħ/2 ) → (sin^2 theta)( ħ/2 )

So,

<S_z> = ( ħ/2 ) ( cos^2 theta + sin^2 theta ) 

But cos^2 + sin^2 =1, so <S_z> = (ħ/2 ) (1) ) = ħ/2 ?

Wait, that can't be right. Because when the state is |+z>, the expectation value is ħ/2, and when it's |−z>, it's -ħ/2. But according to this, the expectation value is always ħ/2. That makes no sense.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let's go back.

The state is |psi(t)> = cos theta |+z> + i sin theta |−z>, where theta = gamma B t/2.

So the inner product <Sz> is:

<psi(t)| S_z |psi(t) > 

Breaking this down:

= [ cos(theta)* < +z | + i sin(theta) < -z | ] × [ S_z ( cos(theta) |+z> + i sin(theta) |−z> ) ]

= cos(theta) < +z | S_z cos(theta) |+z> + cos(theta) < +z | S_z (i sin(theta) |−z> )
+ i sin(theta) < -z | S_z cos(theta) |+z> + i sin(theta) < -z | S_z (i sin(theta) |−z> )

Compute each term:

First term: cos^2 theta * (S_z value for |+z>) → cos^2 theta * (ħ/2 )

Second term: cos(theta) * i sin(theta) * ( < +z | S_z | -z > )

But S_z | -z > = (-ħ/2 ) | -z >. So < +z | S_z | -z > = (-ħ/2 ) < +z | -z > = 0.

Similarly, third term: i sin(theta) cos(theta) * < -z | S_z | +z > = 0.

Fourth term: i sin(theta) * i sin(theta) * < -z | S_z | -z > → (i^2) sin^2 theta * ( - ħ/2 )

i^2 is -1, so this term becomes (-1) sin^2 theta * (- ħ/2 ) → ( sin^2 theta ) ( ħ/2 )

So adding all terms:

= cos^2 theta ( ħ/2 ) + 0 + 0 + ( sin^2 theta ) ( ħ/2 )

= ( ħ/2 ) ( cos^2 theta + sin^2 theta ) = ħ/2 * 1 = ħ/2

Wait, so the expectation value is always ħ/2? That can't be right because the average of the z-component is supposed to oscillate.

Hmm, that suggests that my approach is wrong. Maybe I should have considered a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I should model the time evolution under the new Hamiltonian and compute the expectation value of the magnetic moment's z-component, which is mu_z = gamma S_z.

So, the average of mu_z would be gamma times <S_z>.

Since <S_z> is ħ/2, then <mu_z> is gamma * ħ/2. But this doesn't oscillate, which contradicts the problem statement.

Wait, but in the problem, the magnetic moment is mu = gamma S_z, so maybe the oscillation is in the magnetic moment's z-component. But according to this, it's constant. Hmm, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps I did something wrong in the expansion.

Wait, perhaps I should express the state in terms of the energy eigenstates and compute the expectation value.

Wait another approach: since the Hamiltonian is H = -gamma B Sy, the time evolution of the state can be written as |psi(t)> = e^{-i H t / ħ} |+z>.

But since H = -gamma B Sy, and Sy has eigenstates |+y> and |-y> with eigenvalues ± ħ/2.

So H = -gamma B Sy = (-gamma B)(ħ/2) |+y><+y| + (gamma B)(ħ/2) |-y><-y|

So the time evolution operator is:

e^{-i H t/ħ} = e^{-i (-gamma B (ħ/2) ) t / ħ } |+y><+y| + e^{-i (gamma B (ħ/2) ) t / ħ } |−y><−y|

Which simplifies to:

e^{i gamma B t/2} |+y><+y| + e^{-i gamma B t/2} |−y><−y|

Because (-gamma B (ħ/2) ) t / ħ = (- gamma B t ) / (2) * ( ħ / ħ ) = (-gamma B t / 2 )

So the time evolution operator becomes:

e^{i (gamma B t/2 )} |+y><+y| + e^{-i (gamma B t/2 )} |−y><−y|

Now, since the initial state is |+z> = (|+y> + |-y> ) / sqrt(2), the evolved state is:

e^{i (gamma B t/2 )} |+y> / sqrt(2) + e^{-i (gamma B t/2 )} |-y> / sqrt(2)

Which is the same as I calculated earlier.

So, the state at time t is |psi(t)> = [e^{i (gamma B t/2 )} |+y> + e^{-i (gamma B t/2 )} |-y> ] / sqrt(2)

Expressed in terms of |+z> and |−z>, this becomes:

[ e^{i (gamma B t/2 )} (|+z> + |−z> ) / sqrt(2) + e^{-i (gamma B t/2 )} (|+z> - |−z> ) / sqrt(2) ] / sqrt(2)

Which simplifies to:

( e^{i theta} (|+z> + |−z> ) + e^{-i theta} (|+z> - |−z> ) ) / (2)

Where theta = gamma B t/2.

Expanding this:

= [ (e^{i theta} + e^{-i theta}) |+z> + (e^{i theta} - e^{-i theta}) |−z> ] / 2

= [ 2 cos(theta) |+z> + 2i sin(theta) |−z> ] / 2 

= cos(theta) |+z> + i sin(theta) |−z>

So, the state is cos(theta) |+z> + i sin(theta) |−z>.

Wait, then the expectation value of S_z is:

<psi(t)| S_z |psi(t) > 

Which is cos^2(theta) * (ħ/2) + (i sin(theta))^2 * (- ħ/2)

Wait, no, because:

< S_z > = [ cos(theta) ]^2 (ħ/2) + [i sin(theta) ]^2 ( - ħ/2 )

But [i sin(theta)]^2 = i^2 sin^2(theta) = - sin^2(theta)

So,

< S_z > = ( cos^2(theta) ) * ( ħ/2 ) + ( - sin^2(theta) ) * ( - ħ/2 )

= ( ħ/2 ) cos^2(theta) + ( ħ/2 ) sin^2(theta )

= ( ħ/2 ) ( cos^2(theta) + sin^2(theta) ) = ħ/2 (1) = ħ/2.

So <S_z> is constant? That can't be right because the problem states that the average z-component oscillates. So this suggests I must have made a mistake in the approach.

Hmm, maybe the mistake comes from assuming that mu is along Z and the field is along Y, leading to zero interaction. Because if mu is along Z and B is along Y, their dot product is zero, so H = 0. So the state doesn't evolve, and <Sz> remains the same. But the problem statement says that the average starts oscillating, which suggests that the system is evolving. So perhaps mu is not along Z, but along the direction of the spin, which is changing.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the initial assumption about mu. Let's clarify: the problem says mu = gamma * Sz. So mu is a vector whose only component is along Z. So when the magnetic field is along Y, mu is along Z, so the interaction mu·B is zero. So the energy is zero, and the system doesn't evolve. Therefore, the average <Sz> doesn't change, which contradicts the problem statement.

But the problem says the average starts oscillating, so there must be an oscillating <Sz>. Therefore, my initial assumption about mu must be incorrect.

Wait another thought: perhaps mu is not fixed along Z, but is aligned with the spin. So mu = gamma * S, where S is the spin vector. Then, when the field is along Y, the magnetic moment is in the Y direction, leading to a non-zero interaction.

So, perhaps the correct approach is to model mu as gamma times the spin vector, S.

If that's the case, then the initial state is |+z>, and when the field is turned to Y, the Hamiltonian becomes H = - mu · B = - gamma S · B.

Since B is along Y, H = - gamma B Sy.

So the new Hamiltonian is H = - gamma B Sy.

The energy eigenstates of H are |+y> and |-y>, with energies E_+ = - gamma B ( ħ/2 ), E_- = + gamma B ( ħ/2 )

So the initial state is |+z>, which can be written as a combination of |+y> and |-y>.

As before, |+z> = (|+y> + |-y> ) / sqrt(2)

The time evolution of each component is multiplied by a phase factor.

So the state at time t is:

|psi(t)> = ( e^{-i E_+ t/ħ } |+y> + e^{-i E_- t/ ħ } |-y> ) / sqrt(2)

Which, substituting E_+ and E_-:

= [ e^{ i gamma B t/2 } |+y> + e^{ -i gamma B t/2 } |-y> ] / sqrt(2)

Expressed back in |+z> and |−z>:

= [ e^{i theta} (|+z> + |−z> ) + e^{-i theta} (|+z> - |−z> ) ] / (2 )

Where theta = gamma B t/2.

Expanding this gives:

( e^{i theta} + e^{-i theta} ) |+z> / 2 + ( e^{i theta} - e^{-i theta} ) |−z> / 2 i

Wait, perhaps I should compute it more carefully.

Wait, when I expand each term:

e^{i theta} |+y> = e^{i theta} ( |+z> + |−z> ) / sqrt(2)

e^{-i theta} |-y> = e^{-i theta} ( |+z> - |−z> ) / sqrt(2)

So adding these:

[e^{i theta} (|+z> + |−z> ) + e^{-i theta} (|+z> - |−z> ) ] / (2 )

= [ ( e^{i theta} + e^{-i theta} ) |+z> + ( e^{i theta} - e^{-i theta} ) |−z> ] / 2

Expressed using cos and sin:

= [ 2 cos(theta) |+z> + 2i sin(theta) |−z> ] / 2

= cos(theta) |+z> + i sin(theta) |−z>

So the state is |psi(t)> = cos(theta) |+z> + i sin(theta) |−z>, theta = gamma B t / 2.

Now, the expectation value of S_z is:

< S_z > = ( cos(theta) )^2 ( ħ/2 ) + ( i sin(theta) )^2 ( - ħ/2 )

= ( ħ/2 ) cos^2(theta) + ( - sin^2(theta) ) ( - ħ/2 )

= ( ħ/2 ) [ cos^2(theta) + sin^2(theta) ] 

= ( ħ/2 ) (1 ) = ħ/2

Wait, that's still the same result. So <S_z> is constant at ħ/2, which can't be right because the problem says it starts oscillating.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should think about the expectation value of mu_z, which is gamma <S_z>.

If <S_z> is constant, then <mu_z> is also constant. That can't be what's happening. So perhaps my approach is wrong.

Wait, maybe I'm considering the wrong operator. The question asks about the oscillation of the z-component of the particle's moment. So that would be <mu_z> = gamma <S_z>.

But according to this calculation, <mu_z> is gamma * ( ħ/2 ), which is a constant. But the problem says it oscillates, so this suggests that my calculation is wrong.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the expectation value of mu_z, which is gamma times S_z. So if the state is |psi(t)>, then:

<mu_z> = gamma <psi(t)| S_z |psi(t)>

Which as before would be gamma times ( ħ/2 ), which is a constant. So this can't be right.

Wait, I must have missed something. Let me think again. The initial state is |+z>, and when the field is turned to Y, the Hamiltonian is H = -gamma B Sy.

But perhaps the correct way to model this is to find the time evolution under this Hamiltonian. So let's model the time evolution of an initial state |+z> under H = -gamma B Sy.

The time evolution operator is U(t) = exp( -i H t / ħ )

H = -gamma B Sy → H = -gamma B (ħ/2 ) ( |+y><+y| - |-y><-y| )

So,

U(t) = exp( i gamma B Sy t / ħ ) 

Wait, because H = -gamma B Sy, so exp( -i H t / ħ ) = exp( i gamma B Sy t / ħ )

So,

U(t) = exp( i (gamma B t / ħ ) Sy ) 

The eigenvalues of Sy are ± ħ/2. So,

Sy |+y> = (ħ/2) |+y>

Sy |-y> = -(ħ/2) |-y>

So,

U(t) |+y> = exp( i (gamma B t / ħ ) ( ħ/2 ) ) |+y> = exp( i gamma B t / 2 ) |+y>

Similarly,

U(t) |-y> = exp( -i gamma B t / 2 ) |-y>

So, the state at time t is U(t) |+z>

Express |+z> in terms of |+y> and |-y>:

|+z> = (|+y> + |-y> ) / sqrt(2)

So,

U(t) |+z> = [ U(t) |+y> + U(t) |-y> ] / sqrt(2)

= [ e^{i gamma B t/2} |+y> + e^{-i gamma B t/2} |-y> ) ] / sqrt(2)

Expressed back in |+z> and |-z>:

= [ e^{i gamma B t/2} (|+z> + |-z> ) + e^{-i gamma B t/2} (|+z> - |-z> ) ] / (2 )

= [ (e^{i gamma B t/2} + e^{-i gamma B t/2} ) |+z> + (e^{i gamma B t/2} - e^{-i gamma B t/2} ) |-z> ] / 2

= [ 2 cos( gamma B t/2 ) |+z> + 2i sin( gamma B t/2 ) |-z> ] / 2

= cos(theta) |+z> + i sin(theta) |-z>

Where theta = gamma B t/2.

So, the state is |psi(t)> = cos(theta)|+z> + i sin(theta)|-z>

Now, the expectation value of S_z is <S_z> = ( cos^2(theta) )( ħ/2 ) + ( (-i sin(theta))^2 ) ( - ħ/2 )

Wait, no. Let me compute it correctly.

The expectation value is:

< S_z > = < psi(t) | S_z | psi(t) >

Breaking it down:

= [ cos(theta) < +z | + i sin(theta) < -z | ] × S_z [ cos(theta) |+z> + i sin(theta) |-z> ]

= cos^2(theta) < +z | S_z | +z > + cos(theta) i sin(theta) < +z | S_z | -z > 

+ i sin(theta) cos(theta) < -z | S_z | +z > + (i sin(theta))^2 < -z | S_z | -z > 

S_z |+z> = (ħ/2) |+z> → term1: cos^2(theta) (ħ/2 )

S_z |−z> = (-ħ/2) |−z> → terms 2 and 3: cross terms, which are zero since < +z | -z > =0.

Term4: (i sin(theta))^2 ( - ħ/2 ) = (i^2) sin^2(theta) ( - ħ/2 ) = (-1)(- ħ/2 ) sin^2(theta) = ( ħ/2 ) sin^2(theta )

So,

< S_z > = ( ħ/2 ) cos^2(theta) + ( ħ/2 ) sin^2(theta )

= ( ħ/2 ) ( cos^2(theta) + sin^2(theta) ) = ħ/2.

Again, <S_z> is a constant, which can't be correct. But the problem states that the average oscillates. So this suggests that the model is wrong.

Wait, perhaps the problem is not about the spin component, but about the magnetic moment. So mu_z = gamma S_z.

So, the average mu_z is gamma times <S_z>, which is gamma * ( ħ/2 ), a constant. So it doesn't oscillate. But the problem says it does oscillate, so perhaps I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about the expectation value of the spin in the z-direction, which isn't changing. Then what else could be oscillating?

Wait, maybe I should compute the expectation value of S_x or S_y, not S_z.

Wait, but the question is about the z-component of the particle’s moment, which is mu_z = gamma S_z. So unless my initial assumption is wrong, I'm stuck.

Another approach: perhaps the problem is considering the precession frequency. The Larmor frequency is given by gamma * B. But when the field is along Y, perhaps the oscillation is in some other direction.

Wait, the magnetic moment is mu = gamma S. When the field is along Y, the torque causes the magnetic moment to precess around Y. So the oscillation would be in the x-z plane, perhaps.

But the average of the z-component would vary sinusoidally with frequency equal to the precession frequency around Y.

In the lab frame, the z-component of the magnetic moment would oscillate with angular frequency omega = gamma B.

Wait, but in our calculation, the expectation value of mu_z is constant. That's conflicting.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial state is not an eigenstate of the new Hamiltonian. So when the field is suddenly switched, the state is |+z>, but the new Hamiltonian has eigenstates |+y> and |-y>.

So the state can be written as a superposition of these eigenstates, each with different phases, leading to an oscillating interference term.

But in the earlier calculation, the expectation value of S_z doesn't oscillate. So perhaps the mistake is in how I'm calculating <S_z>.

Wait, maybe I should compute the expectation value differently. Let me try again.

The state is |psi(t)> = cos(theta)|+z> + i sin(theta)|-z>, theta = gamma B t/2.

Compute <S_z>:

= [ cos(theta) ]^2 ( ħ/2 ) + [ i sin(theta) ]^2 ( - ħ/2 )

Wait, [i sin(theta)]^2 is (-1) sin^2(theta), so:

= ( ħ/2 ) cos^2(theta) + ( - sin^2(theta) ) ( - ħ/2 )

= ( ħ/2 ) [ cos^2(theta) + sin^2(theta) ] 

= ( ħ/2 ) (1) 

So <S_z> is a constant. So this leads to mu_z being a constant, which contradicts the problem statement.

Wait, maybe I'm confusing the time dependence. Let's check the calculation once more.

The state is |psi(t)> = cos(theta)|+z> + i sin(theta)|-z>, theta = gamma B t/2.

The spin operator S_z has eigenvalues ħ/2 and -ħ/2.

So,

< S_z > = ( |a|^2 ) ( ħ/2 ) + ( |b|^2 ) ( - ħ/2 )

Where a and b are the coefficients for |+z> and |−z> respectively.

In this case, a = cos(theta), b = i sin(theta).

So |a|^2 = cos^2(theta), |b|^2 = |i|^2 sin^2(theta) = sin^2(theta).

Thus,

< S_z > = cos^2(theta) ( ħ/2 ) + sin^2(theta) ( - ħ/2 )

= ( ħ/2 ) ( cos^2(theta) - sin^2(theta) )

= ( ħ/2 ) cos(2 theta )

Ah! Wait a minute. I think I made a mistake earlier. The state |psi(t)> has coefficients cos(theta) and i sin(theta). So the probabilities are cos^2(theta) and |i sin(theta)|^2 = sin^2(theta). So <S_z> is ( cos^2(theta) * (ħ/2) ) + ( sin^2(theta) * (- ħ/2) )

Which simplifies to:

( ħ/2 ) ( cos^2(theta) - sin^2(theta) ) 

= ( ħ/2 ) cos(2 theta )

So <S_z> = ( ħ/2 ) cos(2 theta )

Which is ( ħ/2 ) cos( gamma B t )

Because theta = gamma B t/2, so 2 theta = gamma B t.

So the average of the z-component of the spin oscillates with frequency gamma B.

But the magnetic moment is mu = gamma S. So the average <mu_z> = gamma <S_z> = gamma ( ħ/2 ) cos( gamma B t )

Wait, but the question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment. So the oscillation frequency is gamma B.

But looking at the options, option B is gamma B, and option A is gamma B /2.

Wait, in the calculation, the oscillation is at frequency gamma B.

But wait, the oscillation in <S_z> is at 2 theta, which is gamma B t. So the frequency is gamma B.

So the answer would be option B) gamma B.

But wait, the options include option A as gamma B /2.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Because the time evolution involved theta = gamma B t/2, leading to 2 theta = gamma B t.

So the frequency is gamma B, so the answer is B.

But wait, another perspective: the energy levels have a difference of 2 gamma B ( ħ/2 ) → gamma B ħ.

The energy difference is gamma B ħ. So the transition frequency is (E_+ - E_- ) / ħ = (gamma B ħ ) / ħ = gamma B.

So that would correspond to oscillation frequency gamma B, matching option B.

So the correct answer is B) gamma B.


The problem involves a spin-1/2 particle with magnetic moment $\mu = \gamma S_z$, initially aligned with a magnetic field along the $+z$ direction. The field is then switched to point along the $+y$ direction, and the question asks for the oscillation frequency of the average $z$-component of the particle’s magnetic moment.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Initial Setup**:  
   The particle starts in the eigenstate $|+z\rangle$ of $S_z$, corresponding to $\mu_z = \gamma S_z$. When the magnetic field is along $+z$, the system is in a stationary state.

2. **Field Switch to $+y$**:  
   When the field is suddenly switched to $+y$, the Hamiltonian becomes $H = -\mu \cdot B = -\gamma B S_y$. The eigenstates of $H$ are $|+y\rangle$ and $|-y\rangle$, with eigenvalues $\pm \frac{\gamma B \hbar}{2}$.

3. **Time Evolution**:  
   The initial state $|+z\rangle$ is expressed as a superposition of $|+y\rangle$ and $|-y\rangle$:  
   \[
   |+z\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|+y\rangle + |-y\rangle).
   \]
   Under the new Hamiltonian, the state evolves as:
   \[
   |\psi(t)\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( e^{i\gamma B t/2} |+y\rangle + e^{-i\gamma B t/2} |-y\rangle \right).
   \]
   Rewriting in terms of $|+z\rangle$ and $|-z\rangle$, the state becomes:
   \[
   |\psi(t)\rangle = \cos(\gamma B t/2) |+z\rangle + i \sin(\gamma B t/2) |-z\rangle.
   \]

4. **Expectation Value of $S_z$**:  
   The expectation value of $S_z$ is:
   \[
   \langle S_z \rangle = \cos^2(\gamma B t/2) \frac{\hbar}{2} + \sin^2(\gamma B t/2) \left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right).
   \]
   Using $\cos^2(x) - \sin^2(x) = \cos(2x)$, this simplifies to:
   \[
   \langle S_z \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cos(\gamma B t).
   \]
   Thus, the average $z$-component of the spin oscillates sinusoidally with angular frequency $\gamma B$.

5. **Magnetic Moment Oscillation**:  
   Since $\mu_z = \gamma S_z$, the average $z$-component of the magnetic moment also oscillates with the same frequency:
   \[
   \langle \mu_z \rangle = \gamma \langle S_z \rangle = \frac{\gamma \hbar}{2} \cos(\gamma B t).
   \]
   The oscillation frequency is therefore $\gamma B$.

### Critical Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A ($\gamma B / 2$)**: Incorrect. The oscillation frequency is $\gamma B$, not $\gamma B / 2$.  
- **Option B ($\gamma B$)**: Correct. The oscillation frequency of $\langle \mu_z \rangle$ matches $\gamma B$.  
- **Option C ($\sqrt{2}\gamma B$)**: Incorrect. There is no factor of $\sqrt{2}$ in the frequency.  
- **Option D ($\gamma B / \sqrt{2}$)**: Incorrect. The frequency is not reduced by a factor of $\sqrt{2}$.

### Final Answer:
The oscillation frequency of the average $z$-component of the particle’s magnetic moment is $\gamma B$.  
**Answer: B**
