Okay, so I've got this question about a quasar's spectrum and figuring out its comoving distance. Hmm, let's break it down. I remember that the peak in the spectrum of an object can help determine its redshift, which relates to how far away it is. In this case, the peak is at 790 nm, but I think that's the observed wavelength. Wait, if it's in the near infrared, maybe that's due to redshift from optical light?

Oh right, I've heard that quasars often emit light that peaks in the optical range. So if the observed peak is at about 790 nm, which is in the near infrared, that suggests the light has been redshifted. The rest wavelength for the peak would be shorter. Let me think, the optical range is roughly 400-700 nm. So maybe the rest wavelength is around 550 nm, which is visible green light? Or maybe the peak is in the rest frame somewhere else, but assuming it's around there.

So the observed wavelength λ_obs is 790 nm, and the rest wavelength λ_emit would be shorter. Let's say λ_emit is 550 nm. Then the redshift z can be calculated using the formula λ_obs = λ_emit * (1 + z). So z = (λ_obs / λ_emit) - 1. Plugging in the numbers: 790 / 550 is about 1.436, so z ≈ 0.436. Wait, but that's a rough estimate. Alternatively, I've heard that Lyman-alpha emission is around 121 nm, but that's UV which can't be observed in quasars much due to the Lyman limit. Maybe the peak is from another line, like the Balmer break or something else.

Wait, the question says the flux drops significantly below 790 nm. That suggests that the peak is the highest point, and to the blue side (shorter wavelengths) the flux is lower. So the peak is likely where the rest frame optical emission is redshifted into near IR. So the peak could be at the rest frame optical, say around 500 nm. Then, λ_obs / λ_emit = 790 / 500 = 1.58, so z≈0.58.

But wait, I might have this
