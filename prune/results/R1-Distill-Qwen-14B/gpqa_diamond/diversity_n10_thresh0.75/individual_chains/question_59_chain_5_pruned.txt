Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me. Let me read it again and try to figure out what's going on. The question is about determining the pH of a solution made by mixing three different solutions. Oh right, it's a mixture of acetic acid, hydrochloric acid, and barium hydroxide. Hmm, that's a mix of acids and a base. I remember that when acids and bases are mixed, they can neutralize each other. So I need to find out what's left after this neutralization and then calculate the pH based on that.

Alright, let's break it down step by step. First, I'll probably need to calculate the moles of each component because concentration and volume matter. The formula for moles is Molarity multiplied by Volume in liters, right?

So the three solutions are:

1. 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH (acetic acid)
2. 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl (hydrochloric acid)
3. 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2 (barium hydroxide)

Wait, I should convert the volumes from mL to liters because the formula uses liters. So 500 mL is 0.5 L, 400 mL is 0.4 L, and 300 mL is 0.3 L.

Let me calculate the moles for each:

For CH3COOH: Molarity is 0.1 M, volume 0.5 L. Moles = 0.1 * 0.5 = 0.05 moles. Acetic acid is a weak acid, but I'll come back to that.

For HCl: 0.2 M * 0.4 L = 0.08 moles. HCl is a strong acid, so it will completely dissociate into H+ and Cl- ions.

For Ba(OH)2: 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 moles. Wait, but Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. Each mole of Ba(OH)2 produces 2 moles of OH- because the formula is Ba(OH)2 → Ba²+ + 2 OH⁻. So the moles of OH- would be 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

Now, when you mix an acid and a base, they react. The reaction between H+ and OH- is H+ + OH- → H2O. So I need to figure out which one is in excess here.

But wait, the problem has two acids and one base. So the base will react with both acids. But wait, let me think. Which comes first? The HCl is a strong acid, so it will donate H+ completely. The CH3COOH is a weak acid, so it won't dissociate completely. But when the base is added, maybe it reacts with the strong acid first, then the weak?

Wait, but the three solutions are all mixed together, so H+ comes from both HCl and CH3COOH, and OH- comes from Ba(OH)2.

So total H+ will be from HCl and CH3COOH. Let's compute that.

HCl: 0.08 moles of H+.

CH3COOH is a weak acid, so it doesn't dissociate completely. But in the presence of excess OH-, it might? Hmm, no, wait. The OH- will react with the H+ from all sources.

Wait, perhaps I should compute all the H+ and OH- moles and see which is in excess.

Total H+ comes from HCl and CH3COOH. Let me calculate the initial H+ from HCl: 0.08 moles. The CH3COOH will contribute some H+ but not all. Since it's a weak acid, it might not fully dissociate. But when mixing with a strong base, the OH- will neutralize the H+ from both, but the weak acid might not dissociate
