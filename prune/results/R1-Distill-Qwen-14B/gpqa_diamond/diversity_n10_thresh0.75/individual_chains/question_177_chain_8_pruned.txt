Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this astronomy problem, and I'm a bit new to it, but I'll give it a shot. Let me read the question carefully.

So, there are two stars: Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times that of Star_2. Similarly, Star_1's mass is also 1.5 times that of Star_2. The astronomers found that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Hmm, I remember that the peak wavelength of a black body's emission is related to its temperature. Oh right, Wien's Law! Wien's displacement law says that the peak wavelength is inversely proportional to the temperature. So if both stars have the same peak wavelength, they must have the same temperature. That's an important point.

So, both stars have the same temperature. Now, the question is about their luminosities. I recall that the luminosity of a star depends on both its radius and temperature. The formula I think is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. Since both stars have the same T, the luminosity should be proportional to R squared.

Wait, but wait, the problem says that Star_1's radius is 1.5 times that of Star_2. So, R1 = 1.5 R2. Plugging into the luminosity formula, L1 would be proportional to (1.5 R2)^2, which is 2.25 R2². And for Star_2, L2 is proportional to R2². So L1/L2 would be (2.25 R2²) / (R2²) = 2.25. So that's a factor of 2.25. But wait, the options include 2.23 and others. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, no, wait. The problem says that the stars have the same peak wavelength. So, same temperature. So according to the formula, the luminosity ratio is (R1^2 / R2^2) * (T1^4 / T2^4). But since T1 = T2, the T part is 1. So R1 is 1.5 R2, so (1.5)^2 is 2.25, so L1 should be 2.25 times L2. That would make the answer A) ~2.25.

But wait, the options don't have 2.25 as the first option. Let me check again. Oh wait, option A is ~2.25, which is exactly what I calculated. But wait, are there any other factors I'm missing? The problem mentions radial velocities. Star_1's radial velocity is 0, Star_2's is 700 km/s. How does that affect the calculation?

Wait, radial velocity usually affects the observed wavelength due to the Doppler effect. But in this problem, the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, wait! So the observed wavelengths are the same, but the actual emitted wavelengths (which depend on temperature) might be different because of Doppler shifting.

Wait, that changes things. Because if the star is moving towards or away from us, the observed
