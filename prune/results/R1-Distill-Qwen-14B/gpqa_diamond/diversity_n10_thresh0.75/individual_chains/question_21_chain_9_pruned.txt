Okay, so I have this chemistry question to solve. Let's read through the question carefully. Hmm, the question is about isomers and tautomerism and optical isomerism. I remember that isomers have the same molecular formula but different structures. There are two types mentioned: constitutional and stereoisomers. Constitutional isomers differ in the bonding arrangement, while stereoisomers have the same connectivity but different spatial arrangements, like in enantiomers or diastereomers.

The question has two parts, A and B. Let's tackle them one by one.

Part A: Among benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, which does not show tautomerism. I need to figure out which of these compounds doesn't exhibit tautomerism.

Tautomerism is when a compound can shift a hydrogen and a lone pair, moving a group between two positions, resulting in different isomeric forms. For example, in ketones and aldehydes, if there's an alpha hydrogen, they can undergo tautomerism, like in the case of aldehydes and ketones, but wait, actually, tautomerism is more about compounds having both acidic and conjugate forms, like in enols and ketones.

Wait, tautomerism is also known as keto-enol tautomerism. So, for a compound to show tautomerism, it must have an alpha hydrogen (a hydrogen attached to a carbon adjacent to a carbonyl group). When that alpha hydrogen moves, the structure changes between keto form and enol form.

So, looking at the two compounds given in part A: benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione.

Benzoquinone, I think, is a cyclic structure. Wait, benzoquinone is a benzene ring with two ketone groups. Let me draw it out. Benzene ring with two ketone groups opposite each other. So, structure is O=C6H4-C=O, but actually, the positions can vary. Wait, benzoquinone can have two ketones in para positions (like 1,4 positions) or ortho (1,2) or meta (1,3). But I'm not sure which one it is. Wait, the question says benzoquinone, which I think is para-benzoquinone, so 1,4-diketone.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about the structure. Benzoquinone is a benzene ring with two oxygen atoms as substituents. The structure is O=C-C6H4-C=O, but I'm not exactly certain about the positions. Alternatively, benzoquinone is a benzene ring with two ketone groups in the para positions.

Benzoquinone, I believe, would have two ketone groups. So each ketone is a carbonyl group. Now, does benzoquinone have any alpha hydrogens? The alpha carbons are the ones adjacent to the carbonyl. So in a benzene ring, each carbonyl is attached to a benzene carbon. The adjacent carbons would be the ones on the benzene ring. Wait, no. Because in a benzene ring, each carbon is connected to two others. So the carbonyl is attached to a benzene carbon, which is also connected to another benzene carbon. So the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl are the benzene carbons. Wait, but in a benzene ring, each carbon is bonded to two other carbons and one substituent. So, the carbonyl is attached to a benzene carbon, and that carbon is connected to another benzene carbon, which is connected to another, etc.

So, the carbonyl is C=O, attached to a benzene carbon. The neighboring carbon (the benzene carbon) is connected to another benzene carbon. So, do those carbons have any hydrogens? Well, in a benzene ring, each carbon is bonded to one substituent (like the carbonyl) or a hydrogen. Wait, no, in the case of benzoquinone, the two carbonyl groups are at positions 1 and 4. So, in the ring, each of those carbons is double-bonded to oxygen. The adjacent carbons (positions 2 and 6, etc.) are each connected to the ring and may have hydrogens.

Wait, wait. Let me think about the structure of para-benzoquinone. The structure is O=C-C6H4-C=O. So, the benzene ring has two ketone groups opposite each other. The carbonyl groups are at positions 1 and 4. The adjacent carbons (2,3,5,6) are each CH groups. So, each of the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl (positions 2 and 6, and 3 and 5) are CH groups. So, each of these carbons has a hydrogen. So, for example, the carbon at position 2 is CH, so it has a hydrogen.

If that's true, then the carbonyl groups are in positions 1 and 4, and the adjacent carbons (like position 2) have hydrogens. So, does that mean that benzoquinone has alpha hydrogens? Because the alpha carbon is the one adjacent to the carbonyl. So, in this case, the carbonyl is in position 1, so the adjacent carbon is position 2. The position 2 has a hydrogen attached. So, does benzoquinone have alpha hydrogens? Yes, I think it does.

If a compound has alpha hydrogens, it can undergo keto-enol tautomerism. So, if benzoquinone has alpha hydrogens, then it can undergo tautomerism. But wait, wait. Let me think again
