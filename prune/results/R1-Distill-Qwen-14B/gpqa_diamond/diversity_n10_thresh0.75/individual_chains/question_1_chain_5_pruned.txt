Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I need to think it through carefully. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about two quantum states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are given as 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds. Wait, wait, I'm a bit confused. Quantum states having lifetimes... Oh right, in quantum mechanics, the lifetime of an energy state is related to the uncertainty principle. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle says that the product of the energy uncertainty and the time uncertainty is at least h/(4π), where h is Planck's constant. So, the lifetime here probably refers to the uncertainty in time, τ, which would relate to the uncertainty in energy, ΔE.

The question is asking which energy difference allows them to be clearly distinguished. I think this has to do with the energy resolution needed so that the two states are not confused. So, the energy difference needs to be larger than some minimum value based on their lifetimes.

Wait, how does the lifetime relate to the uncertainty in energy? I remember the formula: ΔE ≈ ħ / τ, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant. But wait, isn't ħ approximately h/(2π), and h is Planck's constant. So the product of energy uncertainty and time uncertainty is about ħ. So, for each state, the energy uncertainty is inversely proportional to the lifetime.

So for the first state with τ1 = 1e-9 seconds, ΔE1 ≈ ħ / τ1. Similarly for τ2 = 1e-8, ΔE2 ≈ ħ / τ2.

Wait, but the question is about the energy difference between the two levels, not their uncertainties. So I'm a bit confused. Let me think again.

The energy difference would be E2 - E1.
