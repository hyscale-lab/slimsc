Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The question is about how the number of stars in a region of the sky changes with distance. They mention that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over parallax to the fifth power, like 1/plx^5. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance, so I need to connect these two.

Wait, parallax is inversely proportional to distance. Oh right, the formula is plx = 1/distance, where distance is in parsecs. So if distance increases, parallax decreases. So plx is 1/r, where r is the distance.

The number of stars varies as 1/(plx)^5. So substituting plx with 1/r, that would be 1/( (1/r) )^5. Let me compute that. (1/r)^5 is 1/r^5, so 1 divided by that is r^5. So the number of stars is proportional to r^5.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. The number of stars is N = k * (1 / plx^5), where k is a constant. Since plx is 1/r, substituting gives N = k * (1/( (1/r)^5 )) = k * r^5. So N is proportional to r^5. But the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance. Wait, does that mean the change in number, like the derivative of N with respect to r?

Hmm, because if the number of stars is N ∝ r^5, then the rate of change of N with respect to r would be dN/dr proportional to 5 r^4. But wait, the question isn't asking about the rate of change; it's asking how the number of stars changes with distance. Wait, maybe I misread. Let me check the question again.

The question says, "how does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?" So per unit range, that is, how does the number vary as you move a small distance dr. So perhaps they're asking about the derivative, like the density or how many stars you encounter as you move further out.

Wait, but if the number N is proportional to r^5, then for a small change in r, the change in N is dN = 5 k r^4 dr. So the change per unit distance (dN/dr) is proportional to r^4. But wait, the options don't have r^4 as the correct answer. Let me see the options again.

Options are A) ~ r^3, B) ~ r^5, C) ~ r^4, D) ~ r^2.

Wait, the options include r^4 as option C. But the question is about the number of stars in the region as a function of distance. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think differently.

Wait, parallax is inversely proportional to distance: plx = 1/r. So when plx increases, r decreases, and vice versa.

The number of stars varies as 1/plx^5. So substituting plx = 1/r, we get N = k * r^5. So for a given region, as r increases, the number of stars increases as r^5. So in the region, the count is proportional to r^5. So the answer should be option B, r^5.

Wait, but wait a second. The question says the number varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So more stars when plx is smaller. Because if plx is 1/r, then as r increases, plx decreases, so 1/plx^5 increases. So when plx is smaller (r is larger), there are more stars. So in a region at distance r, the number of stars is proportional to r^5.

So the number of stars is proportional to r^5, so the answer is option B.

Wait, but I thought maybe the question was about the change per unit distance, but I'm not sure. The way it's worded: "how does the number of stars... change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?" Oh wait, maybe it's asking about the density, like how many stars per unit distance. So it's the rate of change.

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Let's think again. The number of stars N in the region is proportional to r^5. So when r increases by a small amount dr, how much does N change? The change dN is the derivative of N with respect to r times dr. So dN/dr = 5k r^4. So the number of stars per unit distance (the density) would be proportional to r^4.

But then the question says, "change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)." So maybe it's referring to the rate of change, which would be r^4. So the answer would be C.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me re-express the problem again.

Given that N ∝ 1/(plx)^5, and plx =1/r, so N ∝ r^5.

If the question is about how N itself varies with r, then the answer is r^5 (option B). If the question is about how the number changes per unit distance (like the derivative), then it's r^4 (option C).

Looking at the wording: "how does the number of stars... change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?" Hmm, the phrasing "per unit range of distance" sounds like the change in N per unit change in r, which is the derivative. So the change is proportional to r^4. So the correct answer would be option C.

Wait, but that's conflicting with my initial conclusion. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is simply asking about the number of stars as a function of distance, not the rate. So N ∝ r^5, so the answer is B.

Wait, the way the question is phrased: "how does the number of stars ... change with distance (per unit range)"—this is a bit ambiguous. So perhaps it's asking for the dependence of the number on distance, which is r^5, so option B.

But I'm a bit stuck. Let me think of an example. Suppose N = k r^5.

At r=1, N=k. At r=2, N=k*32. So as r increases, the number increases by a factor of r^5. So the number increases as r^5; the dependence is r^5, which is option B.

But if the question is about how the number changes as you go a little further (the differential), then it's dN/dr =5k r^4, which would be option C.

So which interpretation is correct?

The question says, "the number of stars ... varies with parallax as 1/plx^5." So that's N = a * (1/plx)^5, where a is a constant. Since plx =1/r, N = a r^5.

So the total number of stars is proportional to r^5. Hence, the answer is B.

But wait, the way the question is phrased: "how does the number of stars ... change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?" So perhaps it's referring to the differential, the change per unit distance. That would be option C.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is simply about the relationship between the number and distance, not the rate of change.

I'm a bit torn, but I think the intended answer is B, because the question says the number varies with plx as 1/plx^5, which directly translates to N proportional to r^5. So the number of stars increases as the fifth power of the distance.

So the correct answer is B.


The question involves determining how the number of stars in a region of the sky changes with distance, given that the number of stars varies with parallax as \( N \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^5} \). Parallax (\(\text{plx}\)) is inversely proportional to distance (\(r\)), such that \(\text{plx} = \frac{1}{r}\). Substituting \(\text{plx} = \frac{1}{r}\) into the relationship, we find:

\[
N \propto \frac{1}{\left(\frac{1}{r}\right)^5} = r^5
\]

This indicates that the number of stars is proportional to \(r^5\). The question asks how the number of stars changes with distance, specifically "per unit range of distance, \(r\)." This phrasing could imply the derivative of \(N\) with respect to \(r\), which is:

\[
\frac{dN}{dr} \propto 5r^4
\]

However, the question's focus appears to be on the overall relationship between the number of stars and distance, rather than the rate of change. Since \(N \propto r^5\), the number of stars increases with distance as the fifth power of \(r\). Therefore, the correct interpretation is that the number of stars scales as \(r^5\), corresponding to option B.

Answer: B
