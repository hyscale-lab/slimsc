Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the correct sequence of reagents to synthesize a specific compound. Let me take it step by step.

The target molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Hmm, that sounds a bit complex. Let me break down the structure. So, the main part is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, which means there's a cyclohexane ring with a formyl group (CHO) attached. Then, attached to that cyclohexane ring is another cyclohexyl group through a CH2 group that has an OH (hydroxy) substituent. Wait, actually, the substituent is a cyclohexyl and a hydroxyl on the same CH2 group. So the structure is like cyclohexane ring with a CH2OH(cyclohexyl) and a CHO group.

The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. Ethynyl means a triple bond attached—so it's cyclohexane with an ethynyl group, which is like C≡C- attached to the ring.

I need to figure out the reagents that can transform ethynylcyclohexane into the target. Let me think about the possible reactions.

First, ethynyl groups can undergo various additions. One common reaction is the hydroboration, but wait, that's for alkenes. Alternatively, ethynyl groups can be subjected to hydrogenation. But hydrogenation usually adds H2 across triple bonds, turning them into single bonds. So if I hydrogenate ethynylcyclohexane, I would get cyclohexane with an ethyl group, right? Wait, no. Wait, ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane with a C≡CH group. So hydrogenating that would give cyclohexane with a CH2CH3 group? Wait, but hydrogenation of a triple bond to a single bond would add two hydrogens. So the triple bond (C≡C) becomes a single bond (CH2-CH2?), but wait, wait. Wait, ethynyl is C≡C- attached to the ring. So for ethynylcyclohexane, the structure is cyclohexane-C≡CH. So adding hydrogen (H2) with a catalyst like Pd would hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond. So, that would make it cyclohexane-CH2-CH3. Wait, but that would be ethylcyclohexane, right?

Wait, but the target molecule has a cyclohexyl group attached. So maybe I need a different approach. Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is being used in a different way.

Wait, another approach: maybe the alkyne is being functionalized. For example, using NaNH2 and an alkylating agent. Oh wait, sometimes NaNH2 is used in deprotonation or alkylation reactions. So perhaps the triple bond is being converted into an alkyllithium or some kind of organometallic reagent, which could then react with something else.

Wait, looking at the options, each option starts with NaNH2 and something. Let me consider what NaNH2 does. Sodium amide (NaNH2) is a strong base, often used in deprotonating compounds. In the context of alkynes, it can deprotonate terminal alkynes to form acetylides. For example, HC≡CR would lose a proton to form Na+ - C≡C-R.

So, if I have ethynylcyclohexane (cyclohexane-C≡CH), treating with NaNH2 would deprotonate the alkyne to form a cyclohexylacetylide. Then, if an alkyl halide is added, like methyl chloride, it might undergo an alkylation. So the acetylide would attack the methyl chloride, adding a methyl group to the alkyne.

Wait, but wait. Ethynylcyclohexane is CH2-C≡CH attached to the cyclohexane. Or wait, no. Let me think again: ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane with a C≡CH group attached. So the structure is cyclohexane-C≡CH. So upon treatment with NaNH2, it would lose H from the alkyne to form the acetylide: cyclohexane-C≡C^- Na^+.

Then, adding methyl chloride (CH3Cl) would alkylate the acetylide. So the acetylide would attack the methyl chloride, adding a methyl group to the alkyne. So the product would be cyclohexane-C≡C-CH3. But wait, that would be 1-propylcyclohexane? No, wait, the alkyne becomes an alkane. Wait, no. The acetylide is R-C≡C^-, which upon reaction with methyl chloride would become R-C≡C-CH3. But wait, that's R-C≡C-CH3. But wait, propyne is HC≡C-CH3, but in this case, the alkyne is attached to the cyclohexane. So after alkylation, the cyclohexane would have a propyl group? Or wait, perhaps the alkyne becomes R-C≡C-CH3, but that's an alkyne with a methyl group.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake here. The alkyne is CH2-C≡CH attached to cyclohexane? No, ethynyl is -C≡CH. So after deprotonation, the acetylide is -C≡C–Na+. Then methyl chloride would add a methyl to the acetylide, so the product would be -C≡C-CH3. So the cyclohexane would have a propyl group where the triple bond was? Wait, no. So the starting material is cyclohexane-C≡CH. After deprotonation and alkylation, it becomes cyclohexane-C≡C-CH3.

But that's an alkyne, not an alkane. So that's still a triple bond. Hmm, but in the target molecule, I don't see a triple bond. The target is a cyclohexane with a CH2-OH and a cyclohexyl group attached, and a formyl group. So perhaps that's not the right approach.

Alternatively, maybe the alkyne is being converted into a carbonyl group. Another reaction I remember is the hydration of an alkyne to a ketone. That can be done with H2SO4 and HgSO4, which is the oxymercuration method. Wait, but wait, that's for alkenes. Oh, wait, no. Alternatively, for alkynes, the hydration can be done under different conditions. For example, using HgSO4 and H2SO4 with H2O, which would give a ketone from an alkyne.

Wait, if I have cyclohexane-C≡CH, and I perform hydration, would that add an OH across the triple bond, giving a ketone? Let me think. Hydration of an alkyne under acidic conditions typically leads to the formation of a ketone. So for ethynylcyclohexane, the hydration would form cyclohexane-C(OH)2CH3? Wait, no. Wait, the alkyne is R-C≡CH. Hydration would add an OH and H across the triple bond. But wait, the triple bond is between two carbons. If I have R-C≡C-H, upon hydration, it becomes R-C(OH)-CH2-OH? No, perhaps I'm getting confused. Wait, no, the hydration of an alkyne typically gives a ketone if the alkyne is terminal. For example, HC≡C-R would hydrate to RC(O)H. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, maybe it's RC(OH)CH3? No, perhaps I'm mixing things up.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is hydrogenated first. So if I have ethynylcyclohexane, and I hydrogenate it with H2 and a catalyst like Pd, it would become ethylcyclohexane—cyclohexane with a CH2CH3 group. But the target has a cyclohexyl group attached, so maybe that's the way to go.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the triple bond is being used in a cyclopropanation or some addition reaction. Alternatively, perhaps an elimination reaction.

Wait, the target has a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH2OH group. So maybe I need to form a cyclohexyl group through some kind of ring-opening or addition.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the ethynyl group is converted into an enol or something else, but that's probably not the case.

Let me think about the options given. The options are sequences of reactions. Let me look at each option and see what they do.

Option A: 1. NaNH2, methyl chloride; 2. H2/Pd; 3. Ba(OH)2; 4. H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O.

Wait, but looking at the steps, step 4 is H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O. That's a typical oxymercuration condition for alkenes, but again, the starting material is an alkyne. Wait, but after step 2, hydrogenation, would the alkyne become an alkane. So after step 1, the alkyne becomes R-C≡C-CH3 (if it's methylated). Then step 2 would hydrogenate the alkyne, turning it into R-CH2-CH2-CH3. So, that would be a propyl group attached to the cyclohexane. Then step 3 is Ba(OH)2, which is a strong base, perhaps for elimination or oxidation. Wait, Ba(OH)2 is used in the Birch reduction or for elimination in some cases. Then step 4 is H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O. So step 4 is oxymercuration. But if after step 2, we have an alkane, then step 4 wouldn't make sense because oxymercuration is for alkenes or alkynes. Maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Option B: 1. NaNH2, ethyl chloride; 2. Li/liq. NH3; 3. O3/ H2O; 4. NH4OH.

So step 1: NaNH2 with ethyl chloride. That would alkylate the alkyne. So cyclohexane-C≡CH becomes cyclohexane-C≡C-CH2CH3 after alkylation with ethyl chloride. Then step 2 is Li in liquid NH3. That's a Birch reduction condition, which is used to reduce aromatic rings, but I'm not sure how it applies here. Alternatively, Li in NH3 is a strong base and can induce elimination or other reactions. Then step 3 is O3 followed by H2O. That's ozonolysis, which cleaves alkenes into carbonyl groups. But our molecule at this point would have a triple bond (from step 1), so ozonolysis might not apply. Wait, but after step 2, perhaps the triple bond is converted into something else.

Wait, maybe after step 2, the alkyne is hydrogenated? No, because Li in NH3 is a different reaction. Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is reduced to a single bond, making an alkane. Then step 3, ozonolysis of an alkane? No, that doesn't make sense. Ozonolysis is for alkenes.

Option C:1. NaNH2, methyl chloride; 2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate; 3. O3/(CH3)2S; 4. Ba(OH)2.

Wait, step 1: Alkyne becomes R-C≡C-CH3. Step 2: H2 and Pd would hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond, so R-CH2-CH2-CH3. Then step 3 is ozonolysis. But now we have an alkane, so ozonolysis wouldn't do anything. Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Wait, after step 2, the molecule is ethylcyclohexane (if the starting alkyne was ethynylcyclohexane). So hydrogenating would turn the triple bond into a single bond, making a longer chain. Then, step 3 is ozonolysis, which would only act on alkenes, not alkanes. So this seems off.

Option D:1. NaNH2, methanol; 2. Li/liq. NH3; 3. O3/(CH3)2S; 4. NH4OH.

Step 1: NaNH2 with methanol. Methanol is a good nucleophile. Hmm, but NaNH2 is a strong base. Maybe it's a deprotonation followed by some reaction. Wait, maybe the alkyne is being converted into an alkyne with a hydroxymethyl group. Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is being hydroxylated. I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: The target molecule has a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxymethyl group (CH2OH) attached to the cyclohexane ring, along with a formyl group. So perhaps during the synthesis, we're adding substituents.

Wait, let me think about the overall process. Starting from ethynylcyclohexane, perhaps we can add substituents through alkyne chemistry. Maybe the alkyne is first functionalized, then hydrogenated, then some oxidation or addition occurs.

Another approach: The target has a formyl group (CHO). To make a formyl group, perhaps oxidation of a primary alcohol would be needed. Or, alternatively, through a Grignard reaction or some other way.

Wait, so the target has a cyclohexane ring with a formyl group and another substituent. Maybe the ethynyl group is being converted into the formyl group. So, perhaps the ethynyl group is first converted into a ketone, then reduced to an alcohol, then oxidized to a formyl group. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is being converted into an enol ether, then cleaved in some way to form the aldehyde.

Wait, perhaps the steps involve alkyne alkylation, hydrogenation, oxidation, and then some elimination.

Wait, let me think again. The target structure is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So the cyclohexane ring has a CHO group and a CH2OH(cyclohexyl) group attached. So, the substituents are at the same carbon? Or different carbons? Wait, the way the name is written: 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So the cyclohexane ring has a carbaldehyde group (CHO) at position 1, and also a (cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl) group at position 1. Wait, that would mean both substituents are on the same carbon. That's possible, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the CHO is at position 1 and the (cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl) group is at position 1 as well. So that carbon would have both groups attached, which may require some specific chemistry.

But perhaps the main point is to form a formyl group and a hydroxymethyl group attached to the cyclohexane.

So, starting from ethynylcyclohexane. Let me think about possible functional group transformations.

Option D's steps: NaNH2 and methanol. Wait, NaNH2 is a strong base. Maybe in the presence of methanol, it could deprotonate the alkyne to form an acetylide, which then reacts with methanol. Alternatively, perhaps the acetylide could react with something else. But I'm not certain.

After doing step 1 in option D, the alkyne becomes something else. Then step 2 is Li in liquid NH3. That's a strong base, perhaps for deprotonation or elimination.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is to first alkylate the alkyne, then hydrogenate it, then perform some kind of oxidation or addition to form the carbonyl group.

Wait, here's another plan. Let me outline the possible steps:

1. Alkylation of the alkyne to add a substituent.

2. Hydrogenation of the alkyne to a single bond, forming a di-substituted cyclohexane.

3. Oxidation or some reaction to form a carbonyl group.

Wait, but how? Let's think about each option again.

Option C: Steps are NaNH2 and methyl chloride, then H2/Pd, then O3 with (CH3)2S, then Ba(OH)2.

Wait, step 1: ethynylcyclohexane → after NaNH2 and CH3Cl, becomes propargylcyclohexane with a methyl group? Or maybe the alkyne is longer. Then step 2: H2 and Pd would hydrogenate the triple bond into a single bond, so we have a propyl group attached. Then step3: O3 and (CH3)2S (which is a reductive work-up, I think). Ozonolysis typically cleaves double bonds, but if step 2 is hydrogenation, the alkyne becomes a single bond, so after that, there's no double bond. Therefore, ozonolysis wouldn't do anything. So maybe this isn't the right path.

Option D: Steps are NaNH2 with methanol, then Li in NH3, then O3 with (CH3)2S, then NH4OH.

Hmm, step 1: NaNH2 and methanol. Maybe the alkyne reacts with methanol, but how? If the alkyne is deprotonated by NaNH2, it forms an acetylide, which then reacts with methanol. But methanol is a poor electrophile. Alternatively, perhaps the acetylide is quenched with methanol to form an alcohol. Wait, acetylide plus water or alcohol would give the corresponding alcohol. So, for example, R-C≡C^- + H2O → R-C≡C-OH. But that's a ketone upon dehydration. Alternatively, maybe the alkyne is hydroxylated.

Wait, perhaps after step 1, the alkyne becomes R-C≡C-OH. Then step 2 is Li in NH3, which is a strong base and can induce elimination. So R-C≡C-OH treated with a strong base could eliminate to form a triple bond again, but that doesn't help. Alternatively, perhaps step 2 is for deprotonating something else.

Alternatively, maybe step 2 is a Birch reduction, which would reduce aromatic rings but I'm not sure how that applies here.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the alkyne is first converted into a propargyl alcohol. Then, under certain conditions, it could undergo oxidation or other reactions.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps are:

1. Alkylation to add a methyl group, making the alkyne longer.

2. Hydrogenation to a single bond, making a propyl group.

3. Ozonolysis to break the bond and form carbonyl groups.

Wait, but propyl groups don't have double bonds, so ozonolysis wouldn't act. So that might not work.

Wait, perhaps the hydrogenation step in option C isn't using the alkyne correctly.

Wait, another approach: The target has a cyclohexane ring with a formyl group. So perhaps one of the steps involves introducing a carbonyl group.

The formyl group could be introduced via oxidation of a primary alcohol. So perhaps in the synthesis, there's a step where an alcohol is oxidized to an aldehyde.

Looking at the options, step 4 in option A is H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O. That's oxymercuration, which is for alkenes. So perhaps we need to generate an alkene so that it can be converted into a carbonyl.

Wait, so perhaps the steps are:

1. Alkylate the alkyne to add a substituent.

2. Hydrogenate the alkyne to an alkane, which introduces branching.

3. Then, introduce a double bond through elimination.

4. Oxidize the double bond to a carbonyl.

Wait, but let's see.

Option D's step 3 is O3 with (CH3)2S, which is a reductive work-up. Ozonolysis of an alkene would break it into carbonyls. But where would the alkene come from? Perhaps after step 2, some elimination forms a double bond.

Wait, perhaps step 2 in option D is Li in NH3, which is a strong base, causing elimination. So if after step 1, the molecule has a structure that can eliminate to form an alkene, then step 2 would do that. Then step 3 would perform ozonolysis on the alkene to form carbonyl groups.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is alkyne alkylation, then hydrogenation to a single bond, then oxidation to a ketone, then some further reaction.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about each option again.

Option A: Steps are 1. NaNH2, MeCl; 2. H2/Pd; 3. Ba(OH)2; 4. H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O.

So step 1: ethynylcyclohexane becomes cyclohexane-C≡C-CH3.

Step 2: H2/Pd → cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH3 (propyl group).

Step 3: Ba(OH)2. Hmm, Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. Maybe it's used for elimination, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's for oxidizing.

Wait, Ba(OH)2 is often used in the Birch reduction, but that's for aromatic compounds. Alternatively, in some eliminations, like forming alkenes from alcohols.

But after step 2, we have an alkane. Step 3: Ba(OH)2 would probably not do much. Then step 4 is oxymercuration, which needs an alkene, but there's none. So this option seems off.

Option B: Steps 1. NaNH2, ethyl chloride → alkylate alkyne to R-C≡C-CH2CH3.

Step 2: Li/liq. NH3 → possible Birch reduction, but maybe it's for deprotonation or elimination.

Step 3: O3/H2O → ozonolysis. But if step 2 didn't form an alkene, then ozonolysis wouldn't do anything. Alternatively, perhaps step 2 is for hydrogenation of the alkyne to an alkene?

Wait, Li in NH3 is a strong base but not a hydrogenation catalyst. Alternatively, it could cause elimination, forming an alkene from an alcohol.

Wait, perhaps after step 1, the alkyne is longer, then step 2 converts it into an alkene via elimination. But I'm not sure.

Option C: Steps are 1. NaNH2, MeCl → alkyne becomes R-C≡C-CH3.

Step 2: H2/Pd → R-CH2-CH2-CH3 (propyl group).

Step 3: O3/(CH3)2S → but the molecule is now an alkane, so ozonolysis can't act.

Option D: Steps 1. NaNH2, MeOH → perhaps the alkyne is hydroxylated.

Wait, NaNH2 is a strong base. When the alkyne (ethynylcyclohexane) is treated with NaNH2, it forms the acetylide. Then adding MeOH would protonate the acetylide, giving R-C≡C-OH. Wait, but that's R-C≡C-OH, which is an internal alkyne with an alcohol group. Alternatively, maybe the acetylide reacts with methanol to form R-C≡C-OCH3, but that's an ether.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a ketone via hydration. Wait, but that would require different conditions, like HgSO4 and H2SO4, which is step 4 in option A.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the target molecule again. It's 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So the main ring has a formyl group and a substituent that's a cyclohexyl group attached via a CH2OH group.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a -CH2-OH group, and that OH is part of a cyclohexane ring. Or perhaps it's a cyclohexyl group attached via a CH2OH.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the ethynyl group is first converted into a cyclohexyl group through a cyclopropanation reaction, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is first alkylated, then hydrogenated to a single bond, giving a longer chain, which is then oxidized to form a carbonyl group.

Wait, let me consider the correct order of steps:

1. Alkyne alkylation to add a substituent.

2. Hydrogenation to form a single bond, making a longer chain.

3. Oxidation to form a carbonyl group.

4. Some reaction to introduce the hydroxymethyl group.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps involve forming a carbonyl group via oxidation. For example, the alkyne could be converted to a ketone, which is then reduced to an alcohol and then oxidized to a formyl group.

Wait, another approach: Maybe the alkyne is first converted into an alkene via some reaction, then the alkene is used in a Diels-Alder reaction or something else. But I don't see any dienes in the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct reagents are:

- Alkylation of the alkyne (NaNH2, R-X).
- Hydrogenation of the alkyne to an alkane.
- Oxidation of a primary alcohol to a formyl group.

But I'm not seeing how the oxidation would come into play.

Wait, perhaps the sequence in option D is correct.

Option D: Steps are NaNH2 with methanol, then Li in NH3, then ozonolysis, then NH4OH.

Wait, step 1: NaNH2 and methanol. As I thought, this could form an acetylide, which then reacts with MeOH to form an alcohol. So R-C≡C-OH.

Step 2: Li in NH3. This is a strong base, perhaps causing elimination of water to form a triple bond again. But that doesn't help. Alternatively, maybe it's for deprotonation elsewhere.

Step 3: O3 with (CH3)2S. Ozonolysis. But if the molecule is R-C≡C-OH, perhaps that's not an alkene.

Wait, maybe after step 2, the molecule has an alkene. How?

Alternatively, perhaps step 2 causes the elimination of the OH group, forming a triple bond again, but that doesn't help.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the possible products of each option.

The target has a formyl group. Which option includes a step that forms an aldehyde?

Looking at step 4 of option A: H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O. That's oxymercuration, which converts an alkene to a carbonyl group. So if there's an alkene present, this would add an OH group across it, forming a diol, which upon acid workup becomes a carbonyl.

Wait, but where would the alkene come from?

Wait, another thought: Maybe the alkyne is first hydrogenated to a cis-alkene, then undergoes oxymercuration to form a diol, which is then oxidized to a carbonyl.

Wait, but I'm not seeing that clearly.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Alkyne alkylation (add a methyl group via NaNH2 and MeCl).

2. Hydrogenation to form an alkene (using H2 and a catalyst like Pd).

Wait, no, hydrogenation of an alkyne typically goes all the way to a single bond, not stopping at the alkene. Unless controlled hydrogenation is done, but I'm not sure.

Another approach: Maybe after alkyne alkylation and hydrogenation to a single bond, the molecule undergoes elimination to form an alkene, which is then oxidized to a carbonyl.

So, for example:

Step 1: Alkyne becomes longer via alkylation.

Step 2: Hydrogenate to single bond (alkane).

Step 3: Elimination reaction to form an alkene.

Step 4: Oxymercuration or ozonolysis to form carbonyl.

Looking at the options, which option has steps that could do this.

Option B: Steps 1. alkylation, 2. Li/NH3 (maybe elimination), 3. O3, 4. NH4OH.

So step 2 could be elimination, forming an alkene. Then step 3 is ozonolysis, which would cleave the alkene into carbonyl groups. Step 4 with NH4OH may work up the ozonolysis.

So, after step 3, if the alkene is cleaved, perhaps we get two carbonyl groups. But our target has only one formyl group, so maybe that's not it.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is alkylated, then hydrogenated to a single bond, then oxidized to a carbonyl.

But I'm not seeing an oxidation step in the options except for option A's step 4.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Alkyne alkylation → R-C≡C-R'.

2. Hydrogenation → R-CH2-CH2-R'.

3. Ozonolysis → which would cleave any alkenes, but if step 2 didn't form an alkene, this won't help.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think about the target molecule again. It has a cyclohexane ring with a formyl group and another substituent which is a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group. So the substituent is a CH2 group that is attached to both a hydroxyl group and a cyclohexane ring.

Wait, that suggests that perhaps the substituent was formed via a Grignard reaction or some kind of alkylation where the OH group is introduced.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is formed by first alkylating the alkyne, then performing some kind of hydroxylation.

Wait, perhaps the correct reagents are:

1. Alkyne alkylation (NaNH2, R-X).

2. Hydrogenation to a single bond (H2/Pd).

3. Hydroxylation (maybe using HgSO4, H2SO4, H2O) to form a carbonyl.

Wait, but that's in option A step 4.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Alkyne alkylation.

2. Hydrogenation to single bond.

3. Oxidation to form a carbonyl.

But I'm not seeing the steps.

Alternatively, maybe the correct sequence is:

1. Alkyne alkylation → R-C≡C-R'.

2. Reduction to a single bond → R-CH2-CH2-R'.

3. Formation of a double bond via elimination.

4. Ozonolysis to form carbonyl groups.

But I'm not seeing this in the options.

Wait, perhaps option C is the right one. Let's think again.

Option C:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride → alkylates alkyne to R-C≡C-CH3.

2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate → hydrogenates the triple bond to single bond, so R-CH2-CH2-CH3.

3. O3/(CH3)2S → but we have a single bond now, so ozonolysis doesn't do anything.

Hmm, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, maybe there's a step I'm missing. Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a carbonyl group.

Wait, another approach: Maybe the alkyne is first converted into a ketone. How? Using HgSO4 and H2SO4 (hydration), which is step 4 in option A.

So, ethynylcyclohexane → cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.

Wait, if I have ethynylcyclohexane and perform hydration, I would get cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Because the triple bond would be converted into a carbonyl group. Wait, is that correct?

Wait, the hydration of an alkyne can form a ketone or an aldehyde, depending on the structure. For a terminal alkyne, like R-C≡CH, hydration would give R-C(OH)H. But under strong acidic conditions (like H2SO4, HgSO4), the hydration would form the ketone.

Wait, no. Wait, in the oxymercuration of a terminal alkyne, like HC≡C-R, it would form R-C(OH)H. But for ethynylcyclohexane (cyclohexane-C≡CH), hydration would form cyclohexane-C(OH)H, which is a cyclohexylmethylcarbinol? Wait, no. Alternatively, maybe it forms a ketone.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think: Hydration of an alkyne typically requires specific conditions. For example, using HgSO4 and H2SO4 with H2O leads to the formation of a ketone. So for R-C≡CH, it would become R-C(O)H (an aldehyde) if the alkyne is terminal. Wait, but that's not correct because an alkyne hydration under such conditions would typically form a ketone only if the alkyne is internal. For a terminal alkyne, like HC≡CR, the hydration would form R-C(OH)H, which is a ketone if R is an alkyl group. But for ethynylcyclohexane (cyclohexane-C≡CH), the hydration would form cyclohexane-C(OH)H, which is a cyclohexylmethyl alcohol. Wait, but that's a secondary alcohol, not a ketone.

Wait, maybe I'm wrong. Let me think again. Hydration of a terminal alkyne, like HC≡C-R, with H2SO4 and HgSO4 would give R-C(OH)H. If R is cyclohexane, then it would be cyclohexyl-CHOH. So, it would be a secondary alcohol.

But the target has a formyl group, which is an aldehyde. So perhaps after forming the alcohol, it's oxidized to a ketone, but then that's not an aldehyde. Hmm, perhaps this isn't the way.

Wait, maybe the alkyne is converted into a Grignard reagent, but I don't see that in the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is to first alkylate the alkyne, then hydrogenate, then perform a reaction to form the hydroxymethyl group.

I'm going in circles here. Let me try to think about each option's reagents and what they do.

Option C's steps:

1. NaNH2 and MeCl: Alkyne becomes R-C≡C-CH3.

2. H2/Pd: Alkyne becomes R-CH2-CH2-CH3.

3. O3/(CH3)2S: Ozonolysis. But after step 2, it's an alkane; ozonolysis doesn't apply.

So option C is unlikely.

Option D's steps:

1. NaNH2 and MeOH: Maybe R-C≡C-OH.

2. Li in NH3: Strong base; perhaps elimination to form an alkene.

3. O3/(CH3)2S: Ozonolysis of the alkene to form carbonyl groups.

4. NH4OH: Work-up.

So, let's imagine:

After step 1: R-C≡C-OH.

Step 2: Li in NH3 (strong base) → R-C≡C-O^- Li^+.

Then, perhaps elimination occurs, forming an alkene. Wait, but the alkyne is R-C≡C-OH. Eliminating water would form R-C≡C-OH → R-C≡C- + H2O. Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's deprotonated and eliminates to form an alkene.

Wait, another possibility: The alkyne R-C≡C-OH is treated with a strong base, leading to elimination and forming a double bond. For example, R-C≡C-OH → R-CH2-CHO. But how?

Alternatively, perhaps the base induces the elimination of H2O from R-C≡C-OH, leading to R-CH2-CHO. But that would require a certain structure.

Wait, I'm not sure. Let me consider the possible products.

If after step 2, an alkene is formed, then ozonolysis would break it into carbonyl groups. So, for example, if the molecule after step 2 is R-CH2-CH2-OH, but that's not an alkene. Alternatively, perhaps the elimination forms an alkene adjacent to the OH group.

Wait, perhaps step 2 in option D converts R-C≡C-OH into R-CH2-CHO via elimination. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps after step 2, the molecule has an alkene, which upon ozonolysis forms two carbonyl groups. But our target has only one formyl group, so maybe that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is option D, as it includes ozonolysis which can form carbonyl groups, which is needed for the formyl group in the target.

But I'm not fully confident. Another approach: Maybe the correct reagents are alkylation, hydrogenation, and then oxidation to form the aldehyde.

Looking at the options, option A ends with oxymercuration. So if after steps 1 and 2, there's an alkene, then step 4 would add an OH group, which upon oxidation would form the aldehyde.

Wait, but how would an alkene form?

Let me re-examine option A:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride → alkyne becomes R-C≡C-CH3.

2. H2/Pd → alkyne becomes R-CH2-CH2-CH3.

3. Ba(OH)2 → perhaps elimination to form an alkene.

Wait, Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. Maybe it induces elimination of H2O from an alcohol to form an alkene. But where would the alcohol come from?

Alternatively, perhaps Ba(OH)2 is for oxidation. Wait, Ba(OH)2 is more about elimination or forming epoxides, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps Ba(OH)2 is used for the Birch reduction, but that's for aromatic rings.

Alternatively, maybe step 3 in option A is for epoxidation, but that's not likely.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Let me try a different approach. Let me think about each step in the correct synthetic pathway.

The target has a formyl group (CHO) and a hydroxymethyl group attached to a cyclohexane ring, along with a cyclohexyl group.

So, perhaps the alkyne is first converted into a carbonyl group (CHO) via hydration. Then, some alkylation occurs to add the hydroxymethyl and cyclohexyl groups.

But I don't see any alkylation steps in that scenario.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethynyl group is converted into a cyclohexyl group via some kind of cyclopropanation or ring-opening, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Alkyne alkylation to introduce a substituent.

2. Hydrogenation to a single bond.

3. Introduction of the hydroxymethyl group via some kind of addition.

But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is option D, as it includes ozonolysis, which could generate the formyl group. Let me outline what each step would do in option D.

Option D:

1. NaNH2 and methanol → deprotonate alkyne to form acetylide, which then reacts with methanol. So, acetylide + MeOH → R-C≡C-OH.

2. Li in NH3 → strong base, perhaps eliminates water to form an alkene. So R-C≡C-OH → R-CH2-CHO (but I'm not sure about the mechanism).

3. O3/(CH3)2S → ozonolysis of the alkene. If the alkene is R-CH2-CHO, then ozonolysis would cleave it, but that's unclear.

Alternatively, step 2 could form an alkene adjacent to the hydroxyl group, leading to R-CH2-CH2-OH. Then ozonolysis wouldn't do anything.

I'm not confident, but perhaps the correct answer is option D: 1. NaNH2, methanol; 2. Li/liq. NH3; 3. O3/(CH3)2S; 4. NH4OH.

Because step 3 could form the necessary carbonyl group, and step 4 would work it up to form the aldehyde.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Another approach: The synthesis likely involves introducing a formyl group and a hydroxymethyl group.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the alkyne is first alkylated and then hydrogenated, then a ring-opening occurs to form the substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is alkyne alkylation, then hydrogenation, then oxidation to form the formyl group.

Looking back at the options, option A ends with H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O, which is oxymercuration. So perhaps after step 3 (Ba(OH)2), an alkene is formed, which step 4 then converts into a carbonyl.

So, if after step 3, an alkene is present, step 4 would form a carbonyl group. Let me think:

1. Alkyne alkylation → R-C≡C-CH3.

2. H2/Pd → R-CH2-CH2-CH3.

3. Ba(OH)2 → maybe elimination to form an alkene (R-CH2-CH2-CH3 → R-CH2-CH2-CH2, but no, that's not an alkene). Alternatively, Ba(OH)2 could cause a ring-opening, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps after step 2, the molecule has a structure that allows Ba(OH)2 to eliminate a water molecule and form a double bond.

Wait, Ba(OH)2 is often used in the formation of epoxides, but in this case, perhaps it's used for elimination. So if the molecule after step 2 is R-CH2-CH2-CH3, maybe Ba(OH)2 can't do much. So perhaps option A is incorrect.

Given the time I've spent, I'll try to make an educated guess. The correct steps likely involve alkyne alkylation, hydrogenation to an alkene, and then oxymercuration to form a carbonyl.

Looking at the options, none exactly fit that. But perhaps option C's steps are:

1. Alkylation.

2. Hydrogenation.

3. Ozonolysis (but not applicable).

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is option D, considering the presence of ozonolysis for carbonyl formation.


To synthesize 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde from ethynylcyclohexane, the analysis of the options involves determining the sequence of reactions that can achieve the desired transformations. The target molecule has a cyclohexane ring with a formyl group (CHO) and a hydroxymethyl group (-CH2OH) that is also attached to a cyclohexyl group. The starting material, ethynylcyclohexane, contains a triple bond (C≡C) attached to the cyclohexane ring.

### Key Analysis of Each Option:

#### **Option A**:
1. **NaNH2, methyl chloride**: This step alkylates the terminal alkyne, converting ethynylcyclohexane into a propargyl derivative (R-C≡C-CH3).
2. **H2/Pd**: Hydrogenation reduces the alkyne to a single bond, forming a propyl group (R-CH2-CH2-CH3).
3. **Ba(OH)2**: This strong base could potentially induce elimination, forming an alkene. However, the product after step 2 is an alkane, so Ba(OH)2 is unlikely to produce an alkene in this case.
4. **H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O**: These conditions are for oxymercuration, which converts alkenes into carbonyl compounds. Since no alkene is formed in the earlier steps, this step is ineffective.

**Conclusion**: This sequence does not lead to the desired product.

---

#### **Option B**:
1. **NaNH2, ethyl chloride**: Alkylation converts the alkyne into a longer chain (R-C≡C-CH2CH3).
2. **Li/liq. NH3**: This strong base could induce elimination, potentially forming an alkene. However, the mechanism and product are unclear.
3. **O3/H2O**: Ozonolysis cleaves alkenes into carbonyl compounds. If an alkene were formed in step 2, this step could produce carbonyl groups, but the sequence does not clearly establish how the desired substituents are introduced.
4. **NH4OH**: This step likely quenches the ozonolysis reaction, but its role in forming the target molecule is unclear.

**Conclusion**: This sequence does not provide a clear pathway to the target molecule.

---

#### **Option C**:
1. **NaNH2, methyl chloride**: Alkylation converts the alkyne into a propargyl derivative (R-C≡C-CH3).
2. **H2/Pd-calcium carbonate**: Hydrogenation reduces the alkyne to a single bond, forming a propyl group (R-CH2-CH2-CH3).
3. **O3/(CH3)2S**: Ozonolysis cleaves alkenes into carbonyl compounds. However, the product after step 2 is an alkane, so ozonolysis is not applicable.
4. **Ba(OH)2**: This step could induce elimination or oxidation, but the sequence does not clearly lead to the desired product.

**Conclusion**: This sequence does not achieve the target molecule.

---

#### **Option D**:
1. **NaNH2, methanol**: The alkyne is deprotonated to form an acetylide, which reacts with methanol to produce a hydroxylated alkyne (R-C≡C-OH).
2. **Li/liq. NH3**: This strong base could induce elimination, potentially forming an alkene from the hydroxylated alkyne.
3. **O3/(CH3)2S**: Ozonolysis cleaves the alkene into carbonyl compounds. If an alkene were formed in step 2, this step could produce the necessary carbonyl groups for the target molecule.
4. **NH4OH**: This step likely quenches the ozonolysis reaction and stabilizes the product.

**Conclusion**: This sequence provides a plausible pathway to the target molecule, as it includes steps to form the aldehyde group and introduce the hydroxymethyl substituent.

### Final Answer:
Based on the analysis, **Option D** is the most likely sequence of reagents to synthesize 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde from ethynylcyclohexane.
