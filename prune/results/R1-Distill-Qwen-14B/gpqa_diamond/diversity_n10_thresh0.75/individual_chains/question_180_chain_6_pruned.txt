Okay, so I have this physics problem here about calculating the minimum energy of a system of charges. Hmm, let's see... I'm a bit rusty on electrostatics, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The problem states that there's an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. So each has a charge of 2 times the elementary charge, which is approximately 2 * 1.6e-19 coulombs, right? Let me remember that number: 3.2e-19 C per particle.

Twelve of these charges are constrained to stay at a distance of 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. Oh, so point P is where the 13th charge is located, and the other 12 are each 2 meters away from P.

Now, the question is about finding the minimum energy of this system. I think this relates to the potential energy in an electrostatic system. Because when you have multiple charges, the potential energy is the work done to assemble them, bringing each from infinity to their positions.

Wait, but since it's an isolated system, we might have to consider the potential energy between all pairs. Right, the formula for the potential energy between two point charges is U = (k * q1 * q2) / r, where k is Coulomb's constant, about 8.988e9 N·m²/C².

But when calculating the total potential energy of a system of charges, you have to consider every pair. So for n charges, the number of pairs is n choose 2, which is n(n-1)/2. But wait, in this case, some charges are fixed, and others are free but constrained. Hmm.

Wait, the setup is a bit specific. The 13th charge is fixed at P, and the other 12 are each 2 meters away from P. So each of the 12 is at 2 m from P, but are they placed in some configuration around P? Like, maybe arranged symmetrically on a sphere of radius 2m around P. But for potential energy calculation, their mutual distances might matter because each charge interacts with every other.

Wait, but if all 12 are at the same distance from P, but their mutual distances vary. Hmm. So for the potential energy, we need to calculate two parts: the energy between the fixed charge at P
