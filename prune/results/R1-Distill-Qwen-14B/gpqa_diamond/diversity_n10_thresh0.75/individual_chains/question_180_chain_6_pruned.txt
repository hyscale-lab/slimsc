Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem says we have an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. Oh wait, e is the elementary charge, which is about 1.6e-19 coulombs. So each particle has a charge of 2 * 1.6e-19 = 3.2e-19 C. But wait, does the 2e mean 2 times e or 2e as in two elementary charges? Yeah, 2e would be 2 times e, so 3.2e-19 C.

The setup is that 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. So point P is where the 13th charge is, and the other 12 are at a distance of 2 meters from P. I guess these 12 charges are all arranged in a way that they're on the surface of a sphere with radius 2 meters, but maybe it's more complicated than that. Wait, but in terms of calculating the potential energy, I probably don't need to worry about their exact positions, just the distances.

The question is about the minimum energy of the system. Hmm, so it's asking for the minimum potential energy. Because in an isolated system, the potential energy is a key factor in determining the system's state.

Wait, but wait. When dealing with charges, the potential energy is related to the work done to assemble them. Since the charges are identical, they're probably all the same type, like positive. But wait, wait, the problem says they're identical particles each with charge 2e. So they're all like +2e charges, I assume.

So, when you have a group of charges, the potential energy of the system is the work done to bring each charge from infinity to their respective positions. But since all the charges are the same, maybe we can find a formula for that.

Wait, but in this problem, the setup is that 12 charges are at 2 m from P, and the 13th is fixed at P. So the 13th is probably the fixed charge, say, let's call it q13, and the others are q1 to q12. Each of these q1 to q1
