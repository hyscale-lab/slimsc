Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm going to try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about. 

The starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember that adamantane has a diamondoid structure, kind of like a cage structure. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have bromine atoms on two of the bridgeheads, specifically positions 1 and 3.

First, the compound is heated with excess KOH at 240Â°C. I think when vicinal dihalides (two halogens on adjacent carbons) react with a strong base like KOH, they undergo an elimination reaction to form an alkene. But wait, wait. Wait, in this case, the dihalide is 1,3-dibromo. Are those adjacent? Let me think about the structure of adamantane. Adamantane is a diamondoid structure with four cyclohexane rings fused together in a specific way. The positions 1 and 3 are on opposite ends of the structure. Hmm, perhaps they are on adjacent bridgeheads but not directly next to each other. Alternatively, maybe I'm mixing up the positions. For elimination, the bromines would need to be on adjacent carbons, but 1 and 3 might not be adjacent. Wait, maybe I should clarify the structure.

Wait, I think 1,3-dibromoadamantane has bromine atoms on two bridgehead carbons that are two positions apart. So perhaps when heated with KOH, which is
