Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Hmm, let me read it again.

The question is about two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Oh, and its mass is also 1.5 times bigger. The spectroscopy part says they appear brightest at the same wavelength. Oh, wait, radial velocities are given too: Star_1 is moving at 0 km/s, and Star_2 at 700. But the question is about the luminosity ratio, assuming they're black bodies.

Wait, right. Luminosity for black bodies relates to their radius and temperature. The formula I remember is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. So luminosity depends on radius squared and temperature to the fourth power.

But wait, the question says they have the same wavelength where they appear brightest. Oh, that's probably the peak wavelength from their blackbody spectra. I think Wien's Law comes into play here. Wien's displacement law says λ_max * T = constant. The constant is about 2.9×10^-3 m·K, if I recall right.

So if both stars have the same λ_max, their temperatures must be the same? Because λ_max is proportional to 1/T. So if λ_max is the same for both, then T is same. So T1 = T2.

Wait, but wait, what about their velocities? Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s. How does that affect the observed wavelength? Oh, right, Doppler shift. Since Star_2 is moving towards us (because radial velocity is positive, assuming it's moving towards us), its observed wavelength would be blueshifted. But in the question, the peak wavelengths are the same. So maybe we need to adjust for the Doppler shift.

Wait, but the question says the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So the observed λ_max for both is the same. So if Star_2 is moving, its emitted λ_max is different, but we observe it as same as Star_1, which is stationary. Hmm.

So let me think: Star_2 is moving towards us at 700 km/s. The Doppler effect would shift its wavelength. The Doppler formula is λ_observed = λ_emitted * sqrt( (1 + v_r/c) / (1 - v_r/c) ) ), but wait, I think that's for transverse motion or something else. Alternatively, for non-relativistic speeds, the approximation is λ_obs ≈ λ_emit * (1 + v/c), where v is the radial velocity. Wait, no, wait. If the source is moving towards us, the observed wavelength is shorter (blueshifted). So the observed λ is λ_emit * sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) ) ), where beta is v/c.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of frequency. But maybe I should look for the correct Doppler shift formula for wavelength. Let me try to get this right.

The Doppler shift formula for wavelength when the source is moving towards the observer is:

λ_observed = λ_emitted * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) ) )

Wait, no, wait. Let me think: when the source is moving towards the observer, the observed wavelength is shorter. So the observed λ is λ_emitted multiplied by sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) ), where beta is v/c.

So for Star_2, its emitted wavelength (λ_emit2) is longer, because the observed λ (λ_obs) is the same as Star_1's. Because when the source moves towards us, the observed λ is shorter.

Wait, the problem says that the observed wavelengths are the same. So Star_1's λ_emit1 is λ_obs1, and Star_2's λ_emit2 is such that when it's Doppler shifted, it becomes λ_obs2 = λ_obs1.

So for Star_2, λ_emit2 * Doppler factor = λ_obs1.

Let me write that down.

Luminosity for each star is L = 4π R² σ T⁴.

But we have to find the ratio L1/L2.

Since R1 = 1.5 R2, and T1 and T2 are maybe different.

Wait, but from the peak wavelength, for Star_1: λ_max1 = (constant) / T1.

For Star_2, the emitted wavelength is λ_emit2 = (constant) / T2.

But because of the Doppler shift, the observed wavelength λ_obs2 is λ_emit2 multiplied by the Doppler factor. And λ_obs2 equals λ_obs1, which is λ_max1.

So, λ_obs1 = λ_emit2 * Doppler factor.

But λ_emit2 = (constant) / T2.

And λ_obs1 = (constant) / T1.

So,

(constant / T1) = (constant / T2) * Doppler factor.

Simplify: 1/T1 = (1/T2) * Doppler factor.

So Doppler factor is (T2 / T1).

Doppler factor is sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) ), where beta is v2/c, but wait, v2 is radial velocity of Star_2.

Wait, Star_2 has radial velocity 700 km/s, which is v = 700,000 m/s. The speed of light c is about 3e8 m/s, so v/c is about 0.002333... So beta is 0.002333.

So the Doppler factor is sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) ) ≈ sqrt( (0.99766667)/(1.00233333) ) ≈ let's compute that.

(1 - beta) = 1 - 0.002333 ≈ 0.99766667.

(1 + beta) = 1.00233333.

So (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) ≈ (0.99766667)/(1.00233333) ≈ 0.99535.

Square root of that is approximately 0.99767.

Wait, wait, let me compute it more accurately:

0.99766667 / 1.00233333 = (approx) (1 - 0.00233333) / (1 + 0.00233333) )

We can approximate this as (1 - x)/(1 + x) ≈ 1 - 2x when x is small.

Here, x = 0.002333, so 2x is 0.004666.

So (1 - x)/(1 + x) ≈ 1 - 2x = 0.9953333.

Taking the square root: sqrt(0.9953333) ≈ 0.997666.

So the Doppler factor is about 0.997666. So that's the factor by which λ_emit2 is multiplied to get λ_obs2 = λ_obs1.

From earlier: 1/T1 = (1/T2) * Doppler factor. So T2 = T1 * Doppler factor.

So T2 = T1 * 0.997666.

So T2 ≈ 0.997666 T1.

So that means T2 is a bit less than T1.

But let's get back to the luminosity ratio.

L1 = 4π R1² σ T1^4.

L2 = 4π R2² σ T2^4.

So L1/L2 = (R1² T1^4) / (R2² T2^4) )

Given R1 = 1.5 R2, so R1/R2 = 1.5.

So (R1/R2)^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25.

And (T1/T2)^4: T1 is T1, T2 is approximately 0.997666 T1.

So T1/T2 = 1 / 0.997666 ≈ 1.002343.

So (T1/T2)^4 ≈ (1.002343)^4.

Compute that: let me calculate 1.002343^4.

First, ln(1.002343) ≈ 0.0023395.

Multiply by 4: ~0.009358.

Exponentiate: e^0.009358 ≈ 1.00942.

So (T1/T2)^4 ≈ 1.00942.

So L1/L2 = 2.25 * 1.00942 ≈ 2.271.

Looking at the options, option B is ~2.32, option C is ~2.35, option D is ~2.23, and option A is ~2.25.

Hmm, 2.271 is closest to option D, which is ~2.23? Wait, no, 2.27 is between 2.25 and 2.32. Wait, let me recalculate.

Wait, perhaps my approximation of the Doppler factor was a bit rough. Let me compute it more accurately.

First, compute (1 - beta)/(1 + beta), where beta = 700e3/(3e8) = 7e5 /3e8 = 7/(300) ≈ 0.0233333.

So beta = 0.0233333.

So (1-beta) = 0.9766667.

(1+beta) = 1.0233333.

So (1-beta)/(1+beta) = 0.9766667 / 1.0233333.

Let me compute that: 0.9766667 ÷ 1.0233333.

Let me compute 0.9766667 / 1.0233333.

Compute numerator and denominator in fraction:

Numerator: 0.9766667 ≈ 9766667/10,000,000.

Denominator: 1.0233333 ≈ 10233333/10,000,000.

So (0.9766667)/(1.0233333) = (9766667/10,000,000) * (10,000,000/10233333) ) = 9766667 / 10233333.

Let me compute 9766667 ÷ 10233333.

Approximate:

10233333 = 1.0233333e7.

9766667 = 0.9766667e7.

So 0.9766667e7 /1.0233333e7 = (0.9766667/1.0233333) ≈ 0.9545.

Wait, that's different from the previous approx. Hmm, perhaps I made an error earlier.

Wait, 0.9766667 / 1.0233333: let me compute it as 9766667 / 10233333.

Let me compute 10233333 × 0.954 = 10233333 * 0.95=9721666.85, 0.004*10233333=40933.332, so 9721666.85 +40933.332=97625, 97625, wait, 9721666.85 +40933.332=97625, wait no, 9,721,666.85 + 40,933.332 = 9,762,599.182. Hmm, that's close to 9,766,667.

So 0.954 * denominator gives ~9,762,599, but numerator is 9,766,667. So the difference is about 4,068.

So 4,068 / 10,233,333 ≈ 0.000397.

So the fraction is approximately 0.954 + 0.000397 ≈ 0.9544.

So (1-beta)/(1+beta) ≈ 0.9544.

So the square root of that is sqrt(0.9544) ≈ 0.977.

So the Doppler factor is approximately 0.977.

So T2 = T1 * Doppler factor. So T2 = T1 * 0.977.

Wait, no. Wait, from earlier:

We have 1/T1 = (1/T2) * Doppler factor.

So 1/T1 = (1/T2) * [sqrt( (1-beta)/(1+beta)) ) ]

So 1/T1 = (1/T2) * Doppler factor.

So T2 = T1 * Doppler factor.

Wait, yes. So T2 = T1 *  (sqrt( (1-beta)/(1+beta) ) )

Which is T1 * 0.977.

So T2 = 0.977 T1.

So now, the luminosity ratio L1/L2.

L1 = 4pi R1^2 sigma T1^4

L2 = 4pi R2^2 sigma T2^4

So L1/L2 = (R1^2 T1^4) / (R2^2 T2^4 )

R1 = 1.5 R2, so R1^2/R2^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25.

T1^4 / T2^4 = (T1/(0.977 T1))^4 = (1/0.977)^4.

Compute 1/0.977 ≈ 1.0235.

(1.0235)^4.

Let's compute that.

1.0235^2 is approximately (1.0235)*(1.0235) = 1.0475.

Then (1.0475)^2 ≈ 1.0475 * 1.0475.

1.0475 * 1.0475:

= (1 + 0.0475)^2 = 1 + 2*(0.0475) + (0.0475)^2

= 1 + 0.095 + 0.002256 ≈ 1.097256.

So 1.0235^4 ≈ 1.097256.

So L1/L2 = 2.25 * 1.097256 ≈ 2.25 * 1.097256.

2.25 * 1 is 2.25; 2.25 * 0.097256 is approximately 0.21874.

So total is about 2.25 + 0.21874 = 2.4687.

Wait, that's about 2.47, but looking at the options, the options are up to 2.35. Hmm, that can't be right. Did I make a mistake in the Doppler shift calculation?

Wait, perhaps I messed up the Doppler formula. Let me double-check.

The Doppler shift formula for wavelength is:

λ_obs = λ_emit * sqrt( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) ) )

Wait, no, wait. I think I might have the formula reversed. Let me think again. The general Doppler shift formula for light is:

f_obs = f_emit * sqrt( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) ) ), when the source is moving towards the observer.

Wait, but frequency is inversely proportional to wavelength. So when the source moves towards us, the observed frequency increases, so wavelength decreases.

So if the source emits λ_emit, the observed λ_obs is λ_emit * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) ) )

Ah, I think I had it correct earlier, but I might have mixed up the terms.

Wait, let me get it right. The formula is:

λ_obs = λ_emit * ( (1 - v/c) / (1 + v/c) )^0.5

Because when the source moves towards the observer, the observed wavelength is shorter.

So with v positive towards the observer, if v is positive, the denominator becomes (1 + v/c), so the fraction is less than 1, so sqrt brings it down.

So earlier calculation was correct, but in my more precise calculation, I found that (1-beta)/(1+beta) was 0.9544, so the sqrt is 0.977.

So T2 = T1 * 0.977.

So T ratio is T1 : T2 is 1 : 0.977.

Thus, (T1 / T2 ) = 1.0235, as before.

So (T1/T2)^4 = (approx 1.0235^4) ≈ 1.097.

So L1/L2 = 2.25 * 1.097 ≈ 2.468. But the options don't go that high. The options are A:2.25, B:2.32, C:2.35, D:2.23.

Hmm, so perhaps my approach is wrong. Let me think again.

Wait, the question says that the stars appear brightest at the same wavelength. So their observed peak wavelengths are the same. So the observed λ_max is same.

But for blackbody radiation, the peak wavelength is given by Wien's law: λ_max = (hc)/(5k_B T) ), approximately.

Wait, but when the star is moving, the emitted wavelength is affected by Doppler shift. So the observed λ_max depends on the Doppler shift of the emitted λ_max.

So for Star_1, which is stationary, observed λ_max1 = emitted λ_max1 = c1 / T1.

For Star_2, which is moving towards us, observed λ_max2 = emitted λ_max2 * Doppler factor.

But observed λ_max1 = observed λ_max2.

So,

emitted λ_max2 = observed λ_max2 / Doppler factor.

But λ_max is proportional to 1/T, so:

emitted λ_max2 = (hc)/(5k_B T2) )

emitted λ_max1 = (hc)/(5k_B T1) )

But observed λ_max2 = emitted λ_max2 * Doppler factor.

And observed λ_max1 = emitted λ_max1 = (hc)/(5k_B T1) )

Set observed λ_max1 = observed λ_max2:

(hc)/(5k_B T1) ) = [ (hc)/(5k_B T2) ) ] * Doppler factor.

Simplify:

1/T1 = (1/T2) * Doppler factor.

So 1/T1 = (1/T2) * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

So T2 = T1 * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

Ah! Oh wait, I think I made a mistake earlier in the direction. Because Star_2 is moving towards us, its observed λ_max is blueshifted, which is shorter. So the observed λ_max is smaller than the emitted.

Wait, no. Wait, Star_2's emitted λ_max is longer, because when it's moving towards us, the observed λ_max is smaller. So the equation is:

observed λ_max2 = emitted λ_max2 * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

Set equal to observed λ_max1 = emitted λ_max1.

So, emitted λ_max2 = emitted λ_max1 / sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

Because observed λ_max2 = emitted λ_max2 * Doppler factor.

So emitted λ_max2 = observed λ_max2 / Doppler factor.

But observed λ_max2 = observed λ_max1 = emitted λ_max1.

So emitted λ_max2 = emitted λ_max1 / Doppler factor.

But emitted λ_max is proportional to 1/T.

So,

emitted λ_max2 = (1/T2) * constant.

emitted λ_max1 = (1/T1) * constant.

So,

(1/T2) = (1/T1) / Doppler factor.

Which gives T2 = T1 * Doppler factor.

Wait, Doppler factor is sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) ).

So T2 = T1 * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

Wait, this is conflicting with earlier steps. Maybe I should go back.

Wait, let me rederive it.

Wien's law: λ_max * T = constant.

For Star_1, observed λ_max1 = λ_emit1 = (constant) / T1.

For Star_2, observed λ_max2 = λ_emit2 * Doppler factor.

Set λ_emit2 * Doppler factor = λ_emit1.

But λ_emit2 = (constant) / T2.

So (constant/T2) * Doppler factor = (constant/T1).

So 1/T2 * Doppler factor = 1/T1.

So T2 = T1 * Doppler factor.

Doppler factor is sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

Thus, T2 = T1 * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

Now, v is the radial velocity of Star_2, which is 700 km/s. So v=700e3 m/s.

c=3e8 m/s.

So v/c = 700e3 / 3e8 = 7e5 / 3e8 = 7/(300) = 0.023333.

So (1 - v/c) = 0.976667.

(1 + v/c) = 1.023333.

So (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) = 0.976667 / 1.023333 ≈ 0.9544.

So sqrt(0.9544) ≈ 0.977.

So T2 = T1 * 0.977.

Hmm, same as before.

So T1 = T2 / 0.977 ≈ T2 * 1.0235.

So the ratio (T1/T2) is 1.0235.

Now, the luminosity ratio L1/L2 is (R1² T1^4) / (R2² T2^4) )

Given R1 = 1.5 R2, so R1²/R2² = 2.25.

(T1/T2)^4 = (1.0235)^4.

Compute (1.0235)^4.

First, (1.0235)^2 = 1.0235 * 1.0235.

1.0235 * 1.0235:

= (1 + 0.0235)^2 = 1 + 2*0.0235 + (0.0235)^2

= 1 + 0.047 + 0.00055225 ≈ 1.04755225.

Then, square that (to get the 4th power).

(1.04755225)^2:

= (1 + 0.04755225)^2 = 1 + 2*(0.04755225) + (0.04755225)^2.

= 1 + 0.0951045 + 0.0022614.

≈ 1.0973659.

So (T1/T2)^4 ≈ 1.0973659.

So L1/L2 = 2.25 * 1.0973659 ≈ 2.469.

Wait, but the options don't have an option close to 2.47. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, let me check my calculations again.

Wait, the Doppler factor for wavelength is sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) ), but perhaps I should have inverted it because the star is moving towards us.

Wait, no. Because when the source is moving towards the observer, the observed wavelength is shorter. So using the formula, if the source emits λ_emit, the observed λ_obs is λ_emit * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

Which is correct.

So, in the case where Star_2 is moving towards us, its observed λ_obs is blueshifted, so shorter.

But in the problem, the observed λ is same as Star_1. So for Star_2, the emitted λ_emit must be longer than Star_1's λ_emit.

So Star_2's emitted λ_emit is (lambda_emit2) = (lambda_emit1) * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

Hmm, wait, let me rederive this correctly.

The Doppler shift formula for wavelength when the source is moving towards the observer is:

lambda_obs = lambda_emit * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

So if the observed wavelengths are the same, lambda_obs1 = lambda_obs2.

So:

lambda_emit1 * sqrt( (1 - v1/c)/(1 + v1/c) ) ) = lambda_emit2 * sqrt( (1 - v2/c)/(1 + v2/c) ) )

But in this problem, Star_1's radial velocity v1 is 0, so:

lambda_emit1 = lambda_obs1.

For Star_2, v2 = 700 km/s, approaching us.

So,

lambda_emit2 = lambda_emit1 * sqrt( (1 + v2/c)/(1 - v2/c) )

Because:

lambda_obs2 = lambda_emit2 * sqrt( (1 - v2/c)/(1 + v2/c) )

And lambda_obs2 = lambda_obs1 = lambda_emit1.

So,

lambda_emit2 = lambda_emit1 / sqrt( (1 - v2/c)/(1 + v2/c) )

Which is lambda_emit1 * sqrt( (1 + v2/c)/(1 - v2/c) )

Which is why lambda_emit2 = lambda_emit1 * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

Because Star_2 is moving towards us, so v is positive.

So, relating lambda_emit1 and lambda_emit2:

lambda_emit2 = lambda_emit1 * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

But lambda_max is proportional to 1/T, so:

lambda_emit2 = (constant) / T2.

lambda_emit1 = (constant) / T1.

So,

(1/T2) = (1/T1) * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

So,

T2 = T1 / sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

Which is T2 = T1 * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

So same as before.

So, with v=700e3 m/s, v/c ≈ 0.0023333.

So,

(1 - v/c) = 0.9976667,

(1 + v/c) = 1.0023333,

(1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) = 0.9953333.

sqrt(0.9953333) = approximately 0.997666.

So,

T2 = T1 * 0.997666.

So,

T1 = T2 / 0.997666 ≈ T2 * 1.00234.

So,

(T1/T2) = 1.00234.

Thus,

(T1/T2)^4 = (1.00234)^4.

Compute that:

1.00234^2 = 1.00234 * 1.00234.

= 1 + 2*(0.00234) + (0.00234)^2.

= 1 + 0.00468 + 0.0000054756 ≈ 1.0046854756.

Then, square that:

(1.0046854756)^2 ≈ 1 + 2*(0.0046854756) + (0.0046854756)^2.

≈ 1 + 0.0093709512 + 0.00002195.

≈ 1.0093929.

So,

(T1/T2)^4 ≈ 1.00939.

So, L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4.

R1/R2 = 1.5, so (1.5)^2=2.25.

So,

2.25 * 1.00939 ≈ 2.25 * 1.00939 ≈ 2.271.

So approximately 2.271.

Looking at the options, the closest is option D: ~2.23, but wait, 2.271 is between option C (~2.35) and B (~2.32), but not exactly matching any.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of (T1/T2)^4. Let me compute (1.00234)^4 more accurately.

Let me use a calculator approach:

Compute ln(1.00234) ≈ 0.002337 (since ln(1+x) ≈x for small x).

So ln(1.00234) ≈ 0.002337.

Multiply by 4: 0.009348.

e^0.009348 ≈ 1.00942.

So (1.00234)^4 ≈ 1.00942.

So L1/L2 = 2.25 * 1.00942 ≈ 2.271.

But the options don't have 2.27. The options are A) 2.25, B)2.32, C)2.35, D)2.23.

Hmm, perhaps my approach is missing something else.

Wait, perhaps the stars have different velocities. Wait, Star_1 has 0 km/s, Star_2 has 700. But in the Doppler shift calculation, I considered only Star_2's velocity because Star_1 is stationary.

Another thought: Maybe the formula I should be using is the relativistic Doppler shift, not the non-relativistic approximation. For v=700 km/s, which is about 0.23% of c, the non-relativistic approximation is close but perhaps using the exact formula would change things a bit.

The exact Doppler shift formula for wavelength when the source is moving towards the observer is:

lambda_obs = lambda_emit * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

But for precise calculation, perhaps I should compute it accurately.

v=700,000 m/s.

c=299792458 m/s.

v/c ≈ 700e3 / 3e8 = 7e5 /3e8 = 7/(300)≈0.0233333.

So,

(1 - v/c) = 0.9766667.

(1 + v/c) = 1.0233333.

So,

(1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) = 0.9766667 / 1.0233333 = 0.9544.

Wait, I think I made a mistake in calculating this earlier. Let me compute 0.9766667 divided by 1.0233333.

Compute 0.9766667 ÷ 1.0233333.

Let me do this division accurately.

Let me compute 976666.7 / 1,023,333.3.

Which is approximately 0.9544?

Wait, 1,023,333.3 * 0.95 = 972,166.685.

Subtract from 976,666.7: 976,666.7 - 972,166.685 = 4,500.015.

So 0.95 gives 972,166.685.

Now, 4,500.015 divided by 1,023,333.3 is approximately 0.004397.

So the ratio is 0.95 + 0.004397 ≈ 0.954397.

So (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) = 0.954397.

The square root of 0.954397 is approximately:

√0.954397 ≈ 0.97698.

So,

T2 = T1 * 0.97698.

Thus,

T1/T2 = 1 / 0.97698 ≈ 1.0235.

So,

(T1/T2)^4 = (1.0235)^4.

As before, about 1.097.

So,

L1/L2 = 2.25 * 1.097 ≈ 2.469.

Wait, but the options don't have this. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, another thought: maybe the Doppler effect affects the flux, but perhaps I need to consider the change in flux due to the velocity. Oh wait, no, the luminosity is an intrinsic property, not the flux. Wait, but the observed flux would depend on velocity if there's a Doppler boosting or something else, but the question is about the intrinsic luminosity.

Wait, the problem states that the stars radiate as black bodies, and the observed wavelength is the same. So the temperature calculations I did should still hold.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about the fact that Star_2's luminosity is based on its actual radius and temperature, not the observed. So I think the initial approach is correct.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the Doppler shift affects the observed temperature, but the actual temperature is T2, and the calculation is based on that.

Wait, perhaps the question is implying that the observed flux is the same, but no, the problem says the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of (1.0235)^4.

Let me compute it more precisely.

Compute (1.0235)^4.

First, compute (1.0235)^2.

1.0235 * 1.0235:

= (1 + 0.0235)^2 = 1 + 2*(0.0235) + (0.0235)^2.

= 1 + 0.047 + 0.00055225.

= 1.04755225.

Now, compute (1.04755225)^2.

= (1.04755225)^2.

Break it down:

= 1.04755225 * 1.04755225.

Compute 1 * 1.04755225 = 1.04755225.

0.04 * 1.04755225 = 0.04190209.

0.007 * 1.04755225 = 0.00733287.

0.0005 * 1.04755225 = 0.00052378.

0.00005225 * 1.04755225 ≈ 0.00005467.

Add them together:

1.04755225 + 0.04190209 = 1.08945434.

+ 0.00733287 → 1.09678721.

+ 0.00052378 → 1.09731099.

+ 0.00005467 → 1.09736566.

So, (1.04755225)^2 ≈ 1.09736566.

So,

(T1/T2)^4 ≈ 1.09736566.

So,

L1/L2 = 2.25 * 1.09736566 ≈ 2.25 * 1.09736566 ≈ 2.4695.

Hmm, but the options don't include this, so perhaps my approach is wrong.

Wait, another thought: Perhaps the question is considering the Doppler shift in the observed flux, which would affect the calculated luminosity. But the question says they computed luminosity assuming black body radiation. So perhaps their calculation is based on the observed wavelength and luminosity.

Wait, Wait, no. Because the luminosity depends on the intrinsic radius and temperature, not the observed wavelength. So the Doppler shift affects the observed wavelength but not the intrinsic L.

Wait, but how do they find the luminosity? Oh, because they're using the black body formula with the observed wavelengths. Hmm, maybe that's where the mistake is.

Wait, no. The question says they computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than Star_2 by a factor. So they used their own parameters (radius and temperature) to compute L, not the observed parameters.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the ratio of (R1^2 T1^4)/(R2^2 T2^4) using the actual T1 and T2.

But since I found T2 = T1 * 0.977, which is T1 is higher than T2.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the inversion.

Wait, in the star's own frame, their lambda_emit is based on their own temperature.

The observed lambda is based on the Doppler shift.

But the luminosity is computed using the actual radius and temperature, not the observed.

So the calculation I did earlier is correct.

Hmm, but the answer I'm getting is ~2.47, which isn't an option. So maybe I made a miscalculation.

Wait, let me go back to the Doppler factor.

v = 700e3 m/s.

c = 3e8 m/s.

v/c = 700e3 /3e8 = 7e5 /3e8 = 7/(300) = 0.023333.

(1 - v/c) = 0.9766667.

(1 + v/c) = 1.0233333.

(1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) = 0.9766667 / 1.0233333 = 0.9544.

sqrt(0.9544) = 0.977.

So T2 = T1 * 0.977.

Thus, T1 = T2 /0.977 = T2 * 1.0235.

So,

(T1/T2) = 1.0235.

(T^4 ratio) = (1.0235)^4 ≈ 1.097.

So,

L1/L2 = (1.5^2) * 1.097 ≈ 2.25 *1.097 ≈ 2.468.

But the problem says that the luminosity computed is greater by a factor. So the options must have a mistake, or I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the question says Star_2 has a velocity of 700 km/s, but in the opposite direction. Because radial velocity is given as 700 for Star_2. So if Star_2 is moving away, the observed wavelength would be longer. But the problem states that the observed wavelength is the same as Star_1, which is stationary. So if Star_2 is moving away, its emitted wavelength would have to be shorter to appear same observed wavelength.

Wait, but that changes the Doppler factor.

Let me think again: If Star_2 is moving away (v positive in the sense that it's moving away), then the Doppler factor for wavelength is sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ) ), which is greater than 1, causing observed wavelength to be longer.

But in the problem, the observed λ is same as Star_1, which is stationary. So if Star_2 is moving away, its emitted λ_emit must be shorter to have same observed λ.

Wait, but in the problem, the radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s; the second number is for Star_2. So radial velocity is given as 700, which implies moving towards us (since positive radial velocity could mean moving away, but depends on convention).

Wait, the question says, radial velocities of the two stars are 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2 respectively.

Wait, radial velocity is usually defined as positive when moving away from the observer. So Star_2 has a radial velocity of +700 km/s, meaning moving away.

But that would affect the Doppler shift.

Wait, this could be the source of my mistake. Earlier, I assumed Star_2 was moving towards us, but if the radial velocity is positive for moving away, then Star_2 is moving away at 700 km/s.

So now, the Doppler shift formula would be different.

So let's reevaluate.

If Star_2 is moving away from us, then the observed wavelength is longer.

So,

lambda_obs2 = lambda_emit2 * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

Set lambda_obs2 = lambda_obs1 = lambda_emit1.

So,

lambda_emit2 = lambda_emit1 * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

Because,

lambda_emit2 = lambda_obs2 / sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ) )

Which is lambda_emit1.

So,

lambda_emit2 = lambda_emit1 * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

So,

lambda_emit2 = lambda_emit1 * sqrt( (1 - 0.023333)/(1 + 0.023333) )

= lambda_emit1 * sqrt( 0.9766667 / 1.0233333 )

Which is the same as before, 0.977.

Thus, lambda_emit2 = lambda_emit1 * 0.977.

But lambda_emit is proportional to 1/T, so:

lambda_emit2 = (constant)/T2 = lambda_emit1 * 0.977 = (constant/T1) * 0.977.

So,

1/T2 = 0.977 * (1/T1)

=> T2 = T1 / 0.977 ≈ T1 * 1.0235.

So, T2 is higher than T1 now.

Wait, that's the opposite of what I thought earlier.

So,

(T1/T2) = 1/1.0235 ≈ 0.977.

So,

(T1/T2)^4 = (0.977)^4.

Compute (0.977)^4.

0.977^2 = 0.954529.

0.954529^2 ≈ 0.910.

So,

(T1/T2)^4 ≈ 0.910.

So,

L1/L2 = (R1²/R2²) * (T1^4/T2^4 )

= (2.25) * (0.910) ≈ 2.0475.

But that's lower than any of the options except option A (2.25). But this can't be right because when velocity is away, the star emits at a shorter wavelength, implying higher temperature.

Wait, I think I'm getting myself confused. Let's clarify:

If Star_2 is moving away, its observed wavelength would be longer than the emitted. So to have the same observed wavelength as Star_1, which is stationary, Star_2's emitted wavelength must be shorter. Which implies that Star_2's temperature is higher.

Wait, because lambda_emit is inversely proportional to T.

So, for Star_2, lambda_emit2 < lambda_emit1.

Which would mean T2 > T1.

So, with Star_2 moving away, T2 is higher.

So, the ratio T2/T1 = 1/ sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) ) ) = sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ) )

Which is sqrt(1.0233333 / 0.9766667 ) ≈ sqrt(1.0479) ≈ 1.0235.

So,

T2 = T1 * 1.0235.

So,

L1/L2 = (R1²/R2²) * (T1^4 / T2^4 )

= (2.25) * (1 / (1.0235)^4 )

= 2.25 * (approx 0.910) ≈ 2.0475.

Which is about 2.05.

But the options are higher than 2.23.

Hmm, this is getting more confusing.

Wait, perhaps the initial assumption that the observed wavelengths are the same is leading me down the wrong path. Let me think again.

The problem states that the observed wavelengths are the same. So, if Star_2 is moving away, the Doppler shift makes its observed wavelength longer. Therefore, to have the same observed wavelength as Star_1, Star_2 must emit at a shorter wavelength.

Which means Star_2's temperature is higher than Star_1's.

Because lambda_emit = constant / T.

So, in this case, T2 > T1.

So, when Star_2 is moving away, we have:

lambda_emit2 = lambda_obs2 * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

Which is lambda_obs2 multiplied by a factor less than 1.

So, lambda_emit2 < lambda_obs2.

Thus, T2 = constant / lambda_emit2 > T1.

Thus,

T2 = T1 * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

Which is T2 = T1 * 1.0235.

So,

T1 = T2 / 1.0235.

So,

T1 = 0.977 T2.

Thus,

(T1/T2) = 0.977.

So,

(T1/T2)^4 = (0.977)^4 ≈ 0.910.

Now,

L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4 = 2.25 * 0.910 ≈ 2.0475.

Which is about 2.05.

But again, the options don't have this.

I'm really stuck here. Maybe I should try looking for another approach.

Wait, the problem says that the astronomers computed the luminosity. So perhaps their calculation of luminosity uses the observed wavelength.

Which would be wrong, because luminosity is based on actual radius and temperature, not observed. But perhaps in the problem, they mistakenly used the observed wavelength to compute T, which would be incorrect.

Wait, but according to the problem statement, the astronomers computed the luminosity assuming blackbody radiation. So perhaps they used the observed wavelengths to compute the temperatures.

If that's the case, then for Star_2, the observed wavelength is same as Star_1, so T_observed would be same.

But the actual temperature is different because of the Doppler shift.

Wait, that might complicate things, but perhaps that's the case.

So, let me think: If the astronomers used the observed wavelength to compute T, then they would think that T1 = T2.

But the actual T's are different because of the Doppler shift.

So, in that case, L1 = 4pi R1^2 sigma T1^4.

L2 =4pi R2^2 sigma T2^4.

But the computed T1 and T2 would be the same, as observed wavelengths are same.

So, in that case, the computed luminosity ratio would be (R1/R2)^2 * (T_computed1/T_computed2)^4.

But if T_computed1 = T_computed2, then the ratio is (1.5)^2 = 2.25. Which matches option A.

But that can't be right because the correct approach would be to use actual T's, not the observed ones.

Wait, but the problem says they computed the luminosities assuming blackbody radiation. So perhaps they used the observed wavelength to find T, which is incorrect. Because the observed wavelength is shifted.

So, if the observed lambda is same, but Star_2 is moving, the actual T is higher.

So, the astronomers would compute T as same for both, leading to L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 = 2.25. But the actual luminosity ratio would be higher because T2 is higher.

But the question is, the computed luminosity is greater by what factor, assuming they used the correct T's, which would require considering Doppler shift.

But how the question is phrased: "Assuming that the stars radiate as black bodies, they computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of:"

So they must have used the correct T's, considering Doppler shift.

But according to my earlier calculations, that leads to a factor of ~2.47, which isn't an option.

Wait, perhaps I should approximate the Doppler factor.

v = 700 km/s.

v/c = 700e3 /3e8 = 7/(300) ≈ 0.023333.

So,

(1 - v/c) = 0.9766667,

(1 + v/c) = 1.0233333.

(1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) ≈ (0.9766667)/(1.0233333) ≈ 0.9544.

sqrt(0.9544) ≈ 0.977.

Thus, T2 = T1 * 0.977. So T1 = T2 /0.977 ≈ 1.0235 * T2.

So,

L1/L2 = (1.5^2) * (1.0235)^4 ≈ 2.25 * 1.097 ≈ 2.468. Again, not matching the options.

But wait, perhaps the question is considering only the Doppler shift in terms of flux, not the temperature. Because when a star moves towards us, the flux increases due to Doppler boosting.

But in the problem, the question is about luminosity, not observed flux. Luminosity is intrinsic.

Hmm. I'm really stuck here. Maybe I'm missing a key point.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the effect of velocity on the blackbody curve. Because the maximum emission is in the same observed wavelength, so the actual peak for Star_2 is at a different wavelength, but due to Doppler shift, they observe the same λ.

So, the star emits at a different λ_max, but the observed λ_max is same.

Thus, the temperature calculation must include the Doppler factor.

So, the actual temperature of Star_2 is higher than Star_1, since it's moving away, making its emitted λ_max shorter.

Wait, no, no. If Star_2 is moving away, its observed λ_max is longer than its emitted λ_max.

Wait, more accurately:

Star_2 emits at λ_emit2.

Because it's moving away, we observe λ_obs2 = λ_emit2 * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

Which is longer than λ_emit2.

Set λ_obs2 = λ_obs1 = λ_emit1.

So,

λ_emit2 = λ_emit1 * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

Which is shorter than λ_emit1.

So, since λ is inversely proportional to T,

T2 = T1 * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

Which is higher than T1.

So,

T2 = T1 * 1.0235.

Thus, L1/L2 = (R1^2 / R2^2) * (T1^4 / T2^4 )

= (2.25) * (1/(1.0235)^4 )

= 2.25 * (approx 0.910) ≈ 2.047.

Hmm, again, it's about 2.05. But no options match.

Wait, perhaps I should compute (1.0235)^4 more precisely.

Compute 1.0235^4:

1.0235^2 = 1.04755225.

(1.04755225)^2 = 1.0973655.

So,

L1/L2 = 2.25 * (1 / 1.0973655 ) ≈ 2.25 * 0.9115 ≈ 2.047.

So, about 2.05.

But the options are 2.23, 2.25, 2.32, etc.

Hmm, perhaps the initial assumption that the observed wavelength is same leads to T2 being higher than T1, making L1 less than L2.

But the problem states that L1 is greater than L2.

Wait, but according to the calculations, if Star_2 is moving away, T2 is higher than T1, leading to L2 being greater than L1. But the problem says L1 is greater.

Wait, that suggests that Star_2 must be moving towards us, making T2 lower than T1, which makes L1 greater than L2.

Wait, but in that case, the ratio would be 2.47, which isn't an option.

Alternatively, perhaps I should ignore the Doppler shift in this calculation. Maybe the problem assumes that the velocities are negligible, so Doppler shift is insignificant, and thus T1 = T2.

In that case, L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 = (1.5)^2=2.25, which is option A.

But the problem explicitly mentions the velocities, so I think the Doppler shift can't be ignored.

Wait, but perhaps the velocities are a red herring, and the only thing that matters is the radius and the same peak wavelength, which would imply same temperature. So T1 = T2.

Then, L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 = 2.25. Which is option A.

But that doesn't make sense because the Doppler shift would affect the temperature.

Alternatively, the problem may have intended that the same observed wavelength implies same T, so L1/L2 is (1.5)^2 = 2.25.

But that would ignore the Doppler effect, which the problem states.

I'm really confused. I think I need to make a choice based on the options, even if my calculations are conflicting.

Given that my detailed calculation comes to ~2.47, but the options don't include that, perhaps the intended answer is option B (~2.32) or option C (~2.35).

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of (1.5)^2 * (1.0235)^4.

Wait, 1.5 squared is 2.25.

(1.0235)^4 is approximately 1.097.

So 2.25 * 1.097 = 2.468.

But perhaps the exact calculation for (1.0235)^4 is closer to 1.09, making the product 2.25 * 1.09 = 2.4525.

Still, not matching options.

Alternatively, perhaps the Doppler effect is considered as velocity much less than c, so using the approximation for small velocities.

The Doppler factor when v << c is approximately (1 - v/c).

But wait, for velocity towards us, the Doppler factor is sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) ) ≈ 1 - v/c.

Wait, for small v, sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) ) ≈ (1 - v/c) * (1 + 0.5 (v/c)) ) ≈ 1 - 0.5 v/c.

Wait, no, perhaps a better approximation.

Using Taylor expansion for sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) ) when v is small.

Let me write it as:

sqrt( (1 - x)/(1 + x) ) where x = v/c.

Approximate for small x:

(1 - x)/(1 + x) = (1 - x) * (1 - x + x² - x³ + ...) ) ≈ 1 - 2x + 2x² - 2x³ + ... .

Wait, perhaps a better way is to expand the square root.

sqrt( (1 - x)/(1 + x) ) = sqrt( (1 - x) (1 + x)^(-1) ) )

= (1 - x/2) * (1 - x/2) ) approximately for small x.

Wait, perhaps using binomial expansion.

sqrt( (1 - x)/(1 + x) ) = [ (1 - x)(1 + x)^{-1} ]^{1/2}.

Approximate for small x:

(1 - x)^{1/2} ≈ 1 - x/2.

(1 + x)^{-1/2} ≈ 1 - x/2.

Multiply them: (1 - x/2)(1 - x/2) ) = 1 - x + (x^2)/4.

So,

sqrt( (1 - x)/(1 + x) ) ≈ 1 - x + (x²)/4.

Here, x = v/c = 0.023333.

So,

≈ 1 - 0.023333 + (0.023333)^2 /4.

≈ 1 - 0.023333 + 0.000130.

≈ 0.976797.

So, the Doppler factor is approximately 0.9768.

So,

T2 = T1 * 0.9768.

Thus,

T1 = T2 /0.9768 ≈ 1.0238 * T2.

So,

(T1/T2)^4 = (1.0238)^4.

Compute 1.0238^2 = 1.0238 * 1.0238 ≈ 1.0482.

Then, 1.0482^2 ≈ (1 + 0.0482)^2 ≈ 1 + 0.0964 + 0.002325 ≈ 1.0987.

So,

(T1/T2)^4 ≈ 1.0987.

So,

L1/L2 = 2.25 * 1.0987 ≈ 2.471.

Again, same issue.

Wait, but perhaps the problem intended to ignore the Doppler effect, leading to T1 = T2 and L1/L2 = 2.25, option A.

But that would be ignoring the given velocity information, which doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem intended to have Star_2 moving away, making T2 higher, but the factor comes out differently.

Wait, perhaps I should recompute all steps again.

Wait, let me approach it from another angle. Since the observed λ_max is same, we can write:

λ_obs1 = λ_emit1.

λ_obs2 = λ_emit2 * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

Set them equal:

λ_emit1 = λ_emit2 * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

λ_emit is proportional to 1/T, so:

1/T1 = (1/T2) * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

=> T2 = T1 * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

= T1 * sqrt( (1 + (700e3)/(3e8) ) / (1 - (700e3)/(3e8)) )

Compute inside the sqrt:

(1 + 0.0233333) / (1 - 0.0233333) = 1.0233333 / 0.9766667 ≈ 1.0479.

sqrt(1.0479) ≈ 1.0235.

So,

T2 = T1 * 1.0235.

Thus,

(T1/T2) = 1/1.0235 ≈ 0.977.

So,

(T1/T2)^4 ≈ 0.910.

So,

L1/L2 = (2.25) * 0.910 ≈ 2.0475.

But this is not an option either.

Wait, perhaps the problem requires considering the Doppler effect on the flux, which affects the observed luminosity.

Wait, but luminosity is an intrinsic property, not what is observed. The observed flux would be affected by distance and Doppler, but since the problem doesn't mention distance, perhaps it's irrelevant.

I'm really stuck here. Maybe I should look at the options and see which is closest to 2.25 * (1.0235)^4 ≈ 2.47, but since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is 2.25 (option A).

But I'm not confident. Alternatively, the correct approach might have been to not consider the Doppler effect, leading to L1/L2 =2.25.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the Doppler shift.

Wait, another approach: maybe the Doppler shift affects the observed flux, which the astronomers use to compute luminosity.

The observed flux F is related to the intrinsic luminosity L by F = L/(4pi d^2) * (1 + v_r/c), where v_r is radial velocity towards us (positive when moving away). So for Star_2 moving away, F2 = F2_intrinsic * (1 - v_r/c).

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the observed flux is F = L / (4 pi d^2) * (1 + v_r/c), where v_r is radial velocity towards us.

Wait, but in this problem, the distance isn't given, so this approach might not help.

Alternatively, perhaps the flux affects the observed luminosity calculation.

But the problem states that the stars are assumed to radiate as blackbodies, and the luminosity is computed based on that.

I think I've exhausted all approaches. Given the options, and the fact that my detailed calculation gives about 2.47, which isn't present, perhaps the intended answer is option B (~2.32), but I'm not certain.

Wait, maybe I should compute (1.0235)^4 more accurately.

Compute (1.0235)^4:

1.0235^2 = 1.0235 *1.0235.

Let me compute 1.0235 * 1.0235:

= 1 * 1.0235 =1.0235

+ 0.02 *1.0235=0.02047

+ 0.0035 *1.0235=0.003582.

Wait, no, perhaps better to compute 10235 * 10235.

Wait, but perhaps I should compute 1.0235 *1.0235:

= (1 + 0.0235)^2 = 1 + 2*0.0235 + (0.0235)^2.

= 1 + 0.047 + 0.00055225.

= 1.04755225.

Now, compute (1.04755225)^2:

= (1.04755225)^2.

Compute 1.04755225 * 1.04755225.

Break it down:

1 * 1.04755225 = 1.04755225.

0.04 *1.04755225 =0.04190209.

0.007 *1.04755225=0.00733287.

0.0005*1.04755225=0.00052378.

0.00005225 *1.04755225=0.00005466.

Adding:

1.04755225 + 0.04190209 =1.08945434.

+0.00733287 →1.09678721.

+0.00052378 →1.09731099.

+0.00005466 →1.09736565.

So,

(1.0235)^4=1.09736565.

Thus,

L1/L2= 2.25 *1.09736565= 2.4693.

So, approximately 2.47.

But none of the options match. So I'm unsure.

Wait, perhaps the problem intended to ignore the Doppler effect, leading to L1/L2=2.25 (option A), but given the data, that's not accurate.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the Doppler factor.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the Doppler factor as (1 + v/c), but that would be incorrect.

Alternatively, maybe the problem assumes that the Doppler shift has no effect, making T1 = T2, leading to L1/L2=2.25.

In that case, the answer would be option A.

But given the problem statement, I think that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the problem intended that the same observed wavelength implies same T, thus L1/L2= (R1/R2)^2=2.25.

So the answer would be A.

But I'm not confident, as the velocities are given, suggesting that Doppler shift should be considered.

Given the confusion, I'll settle on the initial calculation and choose the closest option, which isn't present, but perhaps the intended answer is B) ~2.32.

Wait, perhaps the exact calculation with more precise numbers would lead to option B.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of (1.0235)^4.

Wait, let me compute (1.0235)^4 with more precision.

(1.0235)^2 =1.04755225.

Now, (1.04755225)^2:

= (1 + 0.04755225)^2 = 1 + 2*0.04755225 + (0.04755225)^2.

=1 + 0.0951045 + 0.0022614.

=1.0973659.

So,

L1/L2=2.25 *1.0973659=2.469.

But since this isn't an option, perhaps the intended approach was to compute without considering the Doppler shift, leading to 2.25, option A.


The problem involves determining the luminosity ratio of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2, assuming they radiate as blackbodies. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times that of Star_2 and a mass 1.5 times that of Star_2. The stars appear brightest at the same observed wavelength, and Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s, while Star_1 is stationary. The goal is to compute the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 exceeds that of Star_2.

### Key Analysis:

1. **Luminosity Formula**:  
   The luminosity of a blackbody is given by:  
   \[
   L = 4\pi R^2 \sigma T^4
   \]  
   where \( R \) is the radius, \( T \) is the temperature, and \( \sigma \) is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. The luminosity ratio is:  
   \[
   \frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{R_1^2 T_1^4}{R_2^2 T_2^4}
   \]

2. **Observed Wavelength and Doppler Shift**:  
   The stars appear brightest at the same observed wavelength, implying their blackbody spectra have the same peak wavelength. Using Wien's law (\( \lambda_{\text{max}} \propto 1/T \)), the temperatures of the stars are related by the Doppler shift due to Star_2's radial velocity. The Doppler factor for wavelength is:  
   \[
   \sqrt{\frac{1 - v/c}{1 + v/c}}
   \]  
   where \( v = 700 \, \text{km/s} \) and \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \). Substituting \( v/c = 0.02333 \), the Doppler factor is approximately \( 0.977 \). This gives:  
   \[
   T_2 = T_1 \cdot 0.977
   \]

3. **Temperature Ratio**:  
   From \( T_2 = T_1 \cdot 0.977 \), the temperature ratio is:  
   \[
   \frac{T_1}{T_2} = \frac{1}{0.977} \approx 1.0235
   \]  
   Raising this to the fourth power:  
   \[
   \left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4 \approx 1.0235^4 \approx 1.097
   \]

4. **Radius Ratio**:  
   The radius ratio is:  
   \[
   \frac{R_1}{R_2} = 1.5 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \left(\frac{R_1}{R_2}\right)^2 = 2.25
   \]

5. **Luminosity Ratio**:  
   Substituting into the luminosity formula:  
   \[
   \frac{L_1}{L_2} = \left(\frac{R_1}{R_2}\right)^2 \cdot \left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4 = 2.25 \cdot 1.097 \approx 2.468
   \]

6. **Options Analysis**:  
   The calculated ratio (\( \approx 2.47 \)) does not match any of the provided options exactly. However, the closest option is **B) ~2.32**, which may result from approximations or rounding in the problem setup.

### Conclusion:
The detailed calculation suggests a luminosity ratio of approximately \( 2.47 \), but since this is not an option, the closest match is **B) ~2.32**.
