Okay, so I've got this physics problem about astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. Hmm, let's break this down.

First, the problem states that there are two astronauts. One has a mass of 2m and is moving at 0.6c, and the other has a mass of 3m moving at 0.5c, both in the positive x-direction. I'm supposed to calculate their relative speed and the total energy of the system.

Wait, wait. Wait a second. So, for the relative speed, I remember that in relativity, velocities don't just add up normally. Like, if something is moving at 0.6c, you can't just subtract another speed from it like in classical mechanics. Oh right, the formula for relative velocity in special relativity is different.

The formula, if I recall correctly, is v_rel = (v1 - v2) / (1 - (v1*v2)/c²). But wait, since both are moving in the same direction, subtracting their speeds. So the relative speed would be (0.6c - 0.5c) divided by (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c²). Let me compute that.

Wait, 0.6c minus 0.5c is 0.1c. Then the denominator: 1 - (0.3 c²)/c² = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So v_rel = 0.1c / 0.7 = (0.
