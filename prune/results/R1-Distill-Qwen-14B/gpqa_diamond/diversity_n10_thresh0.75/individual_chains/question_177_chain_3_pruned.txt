Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure out the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than Star_2. Let me start by reading the problem again and jotting down the key points.

So, the problem states that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. That's R1 = 1.5 R2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2, so M1 = 1.5 M2. Interesting, but wait—how does mass relate to luminosity? Hmm, I remember that for stars, luminosity often correlates with mass because more massive stars are usually brighter. But I'm not sure if mass is the direct factor here, or if it's something else like temperature or radius.

The problem goes on to say that through spectroscopy, the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, right! The peak wavelength of a blackbody spectrum is given by Wien's Law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant and T is the temperature. So if both stars have the same λ_max, their temperatures must be the same. Because if λ_max is the same, then T is the same. So both stars have the same temperature. That's a key point.

Wait, but wait—Wien's law says λ_max is inversely proportional to temperature. So if λ1 = λ2, then T1 must equal T2. So both stars are at the same temperature. That's important because luminosity depends on both radius and temperature.

The problem also mentions radial velocities. Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0 km/s and Star_2 has 700 km/s. Hmm, but radial velocity affects the observed wavelength due to the Doppler effect, right? If a star is moving towards us, its light is blueshifted, and if moving away, redshifted. But wait, in this case, Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s. But I'm not sure how that affects the calculation because the peak wavelength was determined through spectroscopy. Wait, no—does the observed wavelength shift affect the calculation of the peak temperature?

Wait a minute, the problem says they determined the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest. So when a star is moving towards us (if radial velocity is negative), its emitted wavelengths are blueshifted, meaning the observed λ_max would be shorter than the emitted. Conversely, if moving away, the observed λ_max would be longer. But in our problem, Star_1 has 0 radial velocity, so its observed λ_max is the same as its emitted λ_max. Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s—but is that towards or away from us? The problem doesn't specify, but I think for this problem, the direction might not matter because the problem states that the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So the observed λ_max for both stars is the same.

Wait, but this might complicate things. Because if Star_2 is moving, its observed λ_max would be different from
