Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

Alright, the problem is about two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. The given information is that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. The spectroscopy part says that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Then, the radial velocities of Star_1 and Star_2 are 0 and 700 km/s, respectively. The question says that assuming the stars radiate as black bodies, the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than Star_2 by a factor. The options are A to D.

Hmm, okay. Let me break down what I know. I remember that the luminosity of a star can be calculated using the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which is L = 4πR²σT⁴. Here, L is luminosity, R is radius, σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and T is the effective temperature.

So, the problem says both stars have the same wavelength where they appear brightest. Wait, the peak wavelength of a black body is given by Wien's Law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. If the wavelengths are the same, that suggests their temperatures are the same? Because λ_max is inversely proportional to temperature. So if λ is the same, T should be the same for both stars.

But wait, the problem says the radial velocities are different. Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0, meaning it's not moving towards or away from us, so its observed wavelength isn't Doppler shifted. Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s. Oh, but does this affect the temperature calculation? Because the observed wavelength could be shifted, but the peak for the star itself would be at that temperature.

Wait, no. The peak wavelength determined by the star's temperature is independent of its motion. The observed peak would be Doppler shifted. So, for example, if a star is moving towards us, the observed λ_max would be shorter than the actual λ_max. But in this problem, it says the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So that's the observed λ_max for both stars. But Star_2 is moving
