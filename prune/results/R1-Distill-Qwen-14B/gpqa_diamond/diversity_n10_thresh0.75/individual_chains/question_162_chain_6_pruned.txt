Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius r=2. Hmm. I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity and differential geometry, but let me try to think it through.

The metric given is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Wait, that looks a bit strange. Oh wait, maybe it's in two dimensions? Because it's only got dx and dy terms, so it's a 2D metric. Hmm, but I thought pseudospheres are surfaces in higher dimensions, but maybe for this question, it's treated as a 2D surface embedded in some space.

Wait, pseudosphere... Oh right, a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature. Hmm. But the metric here is in 2D, so perhaps it's representing a space with constant negative curvature.

Wait, I remember that in two dimensions, the metric for a space of constant negative curvature can be written in terms of Poincaré coordinates. The Poincaré disk model has a metric like ds² = [4/(1 + x² + y²)]² (dx² + dy²), but wait, that might not be exactly right. Let me think. The standard form is usually something like ds² = (4/(1 + r²))² (dr² + r² dθ²), where r is the radial coordinate. Hmm, but this given metric is in terms of x and y, so perhaps it's using a different coordinate system.

Wait, the given metric is [32/(4 - x²
