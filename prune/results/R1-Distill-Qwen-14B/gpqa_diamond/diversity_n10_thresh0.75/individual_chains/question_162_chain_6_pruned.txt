Okay, so I have this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius 2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think.

The metric given is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Wait, that looks like it's in two dimensions because it's using dx and dy. So the space here is 2D, but I'm trying to find the area of a pseudosphere. Pseudosphere—oh right, that's a surface with constant negative curvature, like a saddle shape.

Wait, the term 'pseudosphere'—I think in the context of general relativity, it's sometimes used as a model for negative curvature. But for this problem, maybe it's more of a mathematical surface. Or perhaps it's referring to the 2D space described by this metric?

Wait, the metric is written in terms of x and y, so it's a 2D surface. So I'm supposed to compute the area of this surface. Oh, but the question says pseudosphere of radius r=2. Hmm. Or maybe the metric represents a pseudosphere?

Wait, the metric is given as ds² = [32/(4 -x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). I remember that for a metric in 2D, the line element is generally expressed as ds² = g_{xx} dx² + 2 g_{xy} dx dy + g_{yy} dy². Here, it's diagonal, so g_{xy}=0, and the other terms are functions
