Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is.

The question is about the Cope rearrangement and another reaction. There are two parts, A and B. I need to figure out the major products for each.

First, let's look at part A. The starting material is ((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene. So the structure is a benzene ring with an attached group. Let me draw that out mentally. The group is (oxy)methyl attached to a 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl chain. Breaking that down: the ene part is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2? Wait, no, but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2CH2-? Wait, but-2-en-1-yl would be CH2=CHCH2CH2- but wait, the position of the double bond is at 2. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-O-CH2-C6H5? Wait, the benzene is attached to OCH2, which is connected to the butenyl group.

Wait, so the molecule is benzyl-O-CH2-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2? No, wait, the but-2-en-1-yl part is CH2=CHCH2CH2-, but with a methyl branch at position 3. So actually, the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-O-CH2-C6H5? Or is the methyl on the second carbon?

Wait, 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl: but has four carbons. The double bond is between C2 and C3. The substituent is on C3. So numbering from the end closest to the benzene: position 1 is the oxygen, position 2 is a CH2, position 3 is CH(CH3), and position 4 is CH2? No, wait. Let me clarify:

But-2-en-1-yl: the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH2- as a substit
