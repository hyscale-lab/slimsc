Okay, so I need to find the mean decay distance of a meson resonance X. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through what I remember.

The question gives me E_X = 8 GeV, m_X = 1.2 GeV, and Γ_X = 320 MeV. Hmm, I think I need to use some formulas related to particle decay and lifetimes.

Wait, decay distance... I remember that the mean decay length is the average distance a particle travels before decaying. The formula involves the lifetime of the particle and its velocity. Oh right, the formula is L = gamma * v * c * tau, where gamma is the Lorentz factor, v is the velocity, c is the speed of light, and tau is the proper lifetime.

But how do I find tau? Oh, right, the proper lifetime tau is related to the particle's width. The uncertainty principle tells us that the lifetime is inversely proportional to the width. The formula I remember is tau = hbar / (Gamma), but wait, I should be careful with the units here.

Gamma is the decay width, which is given as 320 MeV. But wait, in natural units, hbar is about 6.582 x 10^-25 GeV·s. So I think the formula is tau = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (Gamma in GeV). So I need to convert Gamma to GeV. Oh, 320 MeV is 0.32 GeV.

So plugging that in, tau = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = let me calculate that. 6.582 divided by 0.32 is approximately 20.56875e-25 seconds? Wait, no, wait. 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32 is 6.582 / 0.32 = 20.56875, so 20.56875e-25 seconds. Wait, that's 2.056875e-24 seconds. Does that make sense?

Wait, no, wait. Let me do the calculation again. 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32 is 6.582 / 0.32 = 20.56875, so 20.56875e-25 seconds, which is 2.056875e-24 seconds. Right.

Now, I need to find gamma, the Lorentz factor. Gamma is E / (m c²), but since we're using natural units where c=1, it's just E/(m). But wait, E is 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV. So gamma is 8 / 1.2, which is 6.666... approximately 6.6667.

Next, the velocity v. I remember that v = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma²)), but wait, that's for gamma much larger than 1. Alternatively, a better approximation for v when gamma is large is v ≈ c (1 - 1/(2 gamma²)), but perhaps I can use beta = v/c = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma²)). Let me compute beta.

Since gamma is 8/(1.2) = 6.6667, so gamma squared is (6.6667)^2 = approximately 44.4444. Therefore, 1/gamma² is about 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 is 0.9775. The square root of that is sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887. So beta is approximately 0.9887, so v is about 0.9887c.

Alternatively, maybe a more precise calculation is needed. Let me compute gamma precisely. 8 / 1.2 = 6.666666... So, gamma = 6.666666..., which is 20/3. So gamma squared is (20/3)^2 = 400/9 ≈ 44.444444. So 1/gamma squared is 9/400 = 0.0225. So 1 - (1/gamma²) is 0.9775. The square root of 0.9775 is approximately 0.9887.

So beta is about 0.9887.

Now, putting it all together. The lifetime is tau = hbar / Gamma = 6.582e-25 GeV·s / 0.32 GeV = 2.056875e-24 seconds.

The speed is beta c ≈ 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s.

Wait, the speed of light c is approximately 3e8 meters per second.

So, gamma is 6.666666..., v is about 0.9887 c.

The mean decay length L is gamma * beta * c * tau.

Wait, no: L = gamma * beta * c * tau.

So, let me compute each part:

gamma = 20/3 ≈ 6.6666667.

beta ≈ 0.9887.

c = 3e8 m/s.

tau ≈ 2.056875e-24 s.

So let's compute gamma * beta: 6.6666667 * 0.9887 ≈ 6.6666667 * 0.9887. Let me compute that: 6.6666667 * 0.9887 ≈ 6.588.

So gamma * beta ≈ 6.588.

Now, multiply by c * tau: 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s → 3e8 * 2.056875e-24 = 6.170625e-16 m.

Wait, 3e8 * 2e-24 is 6e-16, but more precisely, 3e8 * 2.056875e-24 = 6.170625e-16 m.

Then, multiply by gamma * beta: 6.588 * 6.170625e-16 ≈ let me calculate that.

6 * 6.17e-16 is about 3.7e-15, but more precisely:

6.588 * 6.170625e-16 = ?

Let me compute 6 * 6.170625e-16 = 3.702375e-15.

0.588 * 6.170625e-16 = approximately 3.626e-16.

Adding together: 3.702375e-15 + 0.3626e-15 = 4.06497e-15 meters.

Wait, wait, let me compute 6.588 * 6.170625:

6.588 * 6 = 39.528.

6.588 * 0.170625 = let's see: 6.588 * 0.1 = 0.6588; 6.588 * 0.070625 ≈ 0.465. So total around 1.1238.

So total approx 39.528 + 1.1238 ≈ 40.6518.

So 40.6518e-16 m → 4.06518e-15 m.

So around 4.065e-15 meters.

Looking at the options:

A) 5.0223 * 10^-16 m → 5e-16 m.

B) 4.0655 * 10^-15 m → 4.0655e-15.

C) 5.0223 * 10^-15 m.

D) 4.0655 * 10^-16 m.

So my calculation led me to about 4.065e-15 m, which matches option B.

Wait, but I'm a bit concerned about the precise calculation. Let me double-check the steps.

Alternative approach: Use the formula for the mean decay length. The mean decay length L is (gamma * beta * c * tau).

Tau is h
