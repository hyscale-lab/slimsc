Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll go through it carefully.

The question is about finding the normalization constant 'a' for a given wave function. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) minus 0.5i. Wait, but wait a second, wave functions can have complex components, but usually when we're dealing with normalization, we take the absolute square of the wave function. But in this case, the wave function seems to have an imaginary part. Hmm. Oh wait, maybe I'm misreading it. Let me look again. Oh, right, the wave function is (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So it's a complex function.

Wait, but normalization of the wave function requires that the integral of the probability density over all space is 1. The probability density is the square of the absolute value of the wave function. So for a complex wave function, you take ψ*ψ, where ψ* is the complex conjugate.

So the wave function ψ(x) is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. So ψ*(x) would be (a / sqrt(1+x)) + 0.5i. Then, ψ*ψ is (a²)/(1+x) + (0.5i)(-0.5i) + other terms. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply (a/sqrt(1+x) - 0.5i) by its complex conjugate (a/sqrt(1+x) + 0.5i), you get (a/sqrt(1+x))² plus (0.5i)(-0.5i) times 1. Wait, actually, let me compute it correctly.

Multiplying (a/sqrt(1+x) - 0.5i) by (a/sqrt(1+x) + 0.5i) is equal to [a^2 / (1+x)] + (0.5i)(-0.5i) because the cross terms would be (a/sqrt(1+x))(0.5i) and (-0.5i)(a/sqrt(1+x)), which add up to zero? No, wait no, when you multiply it out, it's (a/sqrt(1+x))² + (0.5i)(-0.5i) + (terms from cross). Wait, no, the cross terms would be (a/sqrt(1+x))(0.5i) + (-0.5i)(a/sqrt(1+x)), which would add to (a * 0.5i ) / sqrt(1+x) - (a * 0.5i ) / sqrt(1+x) = 0. So the cross terms cancel out. So only the first and the last terms contribute.

So ψ*ψ is [a^2 / (1+x)] + (0.5i)(-0.5i). Let's compute that imaginary part. 0.5i * -0.5i is (-0.25 i²). Since i squared is -1, that's (-0.25)(-1) = 0.25. So the probability density is [a^2/(1+x)] + 0.25.

Wait, that's interesting. So the probability density isn't just the square of the magnitude of the first term, but it's actually the sum of the squares of the real and imaginary parts. Because ψ has both real and imaginary components, their squares add up. So that's correct.

So the wave function's square is (a²)/(1+x) + (0.5)^2, because (0.5i)^2 is -(0.25), but when you take the modulus squared, it's (0.5)^2, so 0.25.

Wait, no, let me correct that. Because the modulus squared is (Re)^2 + (Im)^2. So the real part is (a/sqrt(1+x)), so its square is a²/(1+x). The imaginary part is -0.5, so its square is (0.5)^2 = 0.25. So the total probability density is [a²/(1+x)] + 0.25.

Wait, so the probability density is |ψ|² = (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25.

But wait, that can't be, because when you have a complex wave function, the modulus squared is the product of ψ and its conjugate. In this case, it's (a/sqrt(1+x))^2 + (0.5)^2. So yes, it's a²/(1+x) + 0.25.

Wait, but that's a bit unusual. I mean, in most cases, the wave function is real, and the modulus squared is just the square. But here, it's a complex function. So the probability density is (a²/(1+x)) + 0.25. That makes sense.

Now, the wave function is given to be non-zero only between x=1 and x=3. That is, the particle is found between x=1 and x=3, and not outside that region. So the wave function is zero elsewhere. So the normalization condition is that the integral of |ψ(x)|² dx from x=1 to x=3 is equal to 1.

So the integral from 1 to 3 of [a²/(1+x) + 0.25] dx = 1.

Let me write that mathematically:

∫₁³ [ (a²/(1+x)) + 0.25 ] dx = 1.

So I can split this integral into two parts:

∫₁³ (a²/(1+x)) dx + ∫₁³ 0.25 dx = 1.

Let me compute each integral.

First integral: a² ∫₁³ 1/(1+x) dx.

The integral of 1/(1+x) dx is ln|1+x| + C.

So evaluating from 1 to 3:

a² [ ln(1+3) - ln(1+1) ] = a² [ ln(4) - ln(2) ] = a² ln(4/2) = a² ln(2).

Because ln(a) - ln(b) = ln(a/b).

So first part is a² ln(2).

Second integral: 0.25 ∫₁³ dx from 1 to 3.

That's 0.25*(3-1) = 0.25 * 2 = 0.5.

So the equation becomes:

a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So, a² ln(2) = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5.

Therefore, a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

What's ln(2)? Approximately 0.6931.

So a² = 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.72.

So a is the square root of approximately 0.72. Let me compute that.

Square root of 0.72: 0.8485, approximately.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.85, which is close to 0.8485. So the answer should be B) 0.85.

Wait, but let me check my calculations again because I might have made a mistake.

Wait, let's compute 0.5 / ln(2).

ln(2) is approximately 0.693147.

So 0.5 / 0.693147 = approximately 0.7213.

The square root of 0.7213 is about 0.849, which rounds to 0.85.

So yes, option B is the right answer.


To determine the normalization constant \( a \), we start with the given wave function:

\[
\psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i
\]

The probability density is the modulus squared of the wave function, \( |\psi(x)|^2 \). For a complex wave function, this is computed as:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + \left(0.5\right)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25
\]

The wave function is non-zero only between \( x = 1 \) and \( x = 3 \), so the normalization condition is:

\[
\int_1^3 |\psi(x)|^2 \, dx = 1
\]

Substituting \( |\psi(x)|^2 \), the integral becomes:

\[
\int_1^3 \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1
\]

This can be split into two separate integrals:

\[
a^2 \int_1^3 \frac{1}{1+x} \, dx + \int_1^3 0.25 \, dx = 1
\]

### First Integral:
\[
a^2 \int_1^3 \frac{1}{1+x} \, dx
\]

The integral of \( \frac{1}{1+x} \) is \( \ln|1+x| \). Evaluating from \( x = 1 \) to \( x = 3 \):

\[
a^2 \left[\ln(4) - \ln(2)\right] = a^2 \ln(2)
\]

### Second Integral:
\[
\int_1^3 0.25 \, dx
\]

This is straightforward:

\[
0.25 \cdot (3 - 1) = 0.5
\]

### Combining Results:
The normalization condition becomes:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1
\]

Solving for \( a^2 \):

\[
a^2 \ln(2) = 0.5 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}
\]

Using \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \):

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7213
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
a \approx \sqrt{0.7213} \approx 0.849
\]

This rounds to \( a \approx 0.85 \). Comparing with the options, the correct answer is:

**B) 0.85**

Answer: B
