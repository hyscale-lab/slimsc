Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. 

The question is about a star similar to the Sun, with some spots on it. The star has a radius equal to the Sun's, which I think is about 1 million kilometers, but I might get back to that. The spots cover 20% of one hemisphere, and they have a temperature difference of 1000K. The star's effective temperature is 6000K. 

The main point is about photometric observations. When the star rotates, the spots come into and out of view, causing brightness variations. But the question is comparing this to an exoplanet transit. They want the radius of an exoplanet that would produce the same amplitude in the light curve as these spots do. 

So, the scenario is that without the spots, what planet size would cause the same dip in brightness. Hmm. I remember that the transit method for exoplanets works because when the planet passes in front of the star, it blocks some light. The depth of the dip depends on the ratio of the planet's area to the star's area. 

Wait, but in this star spot case, the brightness variation is due to the spots being cooler (I think) than the rest of the star. So when the spots rotate into view, the total brightness decreases, and when they rotate away, it increases. So the variation is due to the spots modulating the star's light.

Right, so the star's total brightness without spots would be higher. When spots are visible, the brightness drops. The amplitude of this dip is what we're looking at.

The spot has a temperature difference of 1000K. The star's Teff is 6000K, so the spots are at 5000K. Because cooler regions emit less light. So the spots are darker.

I think the key here is to compute the brightness variation caused by these spots and then find the planet radius that would cause the same variation.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Calculate the total brightness variation caused by the spots. The variation is the difference between the star without spots and when spots are visible.

2. Compare this to the variation caused by a planet transiting the star. The planet's area is (R_planet / R_star)^2 times the star's area. The dip is proportional to this area ratio.

So first, let's compute the brightness variation caused by the spots.

The star emits a certain amount of light. Let's model the star as a blackbody. The flux (F) is sigma * T^4, where sigma is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. But since all parts are similar except the spots, maybe I can model the change in flux as the spots cover part of the star.

The star's total flux when spots are not visible (assuming no spots) is F_total = F_star = sigma * T_star^4 * (4 pi R_star^2) / (4 pi D^2) )? Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the star's flux as F = sigma T^4 multiplied by surface area, but perhaps more simply, the total flux is F = sigma * T^4 * (R^2) / (distance squared), but since we're comparing relative changes, maybe the distance will cancel out.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute the fraction of the star's light that is blocked or changed due to the spots.

Each spot has a certain area and a lower temperature. So when the spot is visible, the total flux from the star decreases because that area is now emitting less.

The filling factor is given as 20% for one hemisphere. Wait, the problem says one hemisphere is covered with a filling factor of 20%. So the total area covered by spots on that hemisphere is 20% of the hemisphere's area.

Wait, let me think: the star is a sphere, so the total surface area is 4 pi R^2. One hemisphere is 2 pi R^2. The spots take up 20% of that hemisphere, so the area covered is 0.2 * 2 pi R^2
