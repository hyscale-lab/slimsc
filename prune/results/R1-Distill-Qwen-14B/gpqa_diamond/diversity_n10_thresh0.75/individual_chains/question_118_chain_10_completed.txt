Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let's see what it's about. The question is about the reaction between 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol and bromine. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that enols can undergo various reactions. Wait, the molecule here is a cyclopentenol—that's a cyclopentene with an -OH group. The structure: cyclopent-1-ene means the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2. And the enol part is the -OH attached to the ring. So it's an enol, which is like an alcohol adjacent to a double bond.

The reaction is with bromine. Bromine in what form? Oh, usually when you're adding bromine to enols or conjugated dienes, it's Br2. So this is likely an addition reaction. Wait, but enols can also undergo oxidation. Wait, no, bromine is a dienophile, but I'm not sure. Or maybe it's a dihydroxylation? No, dihydroxylation uses different reagents like OsO4 or H2O2 with acid.

Wait, no, the starting material is an enol. Enols can undergo bromination in a couple of ways. One possibility is that the enol will add Br2 in a conjugated diene-like manner, leading to a dibromide. But wait, enols are more prone to certain reactions because of their structure. Or maybe it's an electrophilic addition.

Alternatively, since the molecule is 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol, the ring has five members, with two methyl groups on carbon 4, and the double bond is between 1 and 2. The -OH is on carbon 1, I think, because it's cyclopent-1-enol. So the structure would have a ring with a double bond from C1 to C2, and the -OH is also on C1, but wait, no, wait: in enol, the -OH is on a carbon adjacent to the double bond. Wait, cyclopent-1-enol would have the double bond between C1 and C2, and the -OH on C2? Or C1? Hmm, maybe I should draw it.

Wait, the numbering: cyclopent-1-ene would have the double bond between C1 and C2. So the enol would have the -OH on C1 or C2? Enols have the structure where the -OH is on a carbon adjacent to the double bond. So if the double bond is between C1 and C2, the enol would have the -OH on C2. Because in a cyclopentene, the numbering would be such that the double bond is between 1 and 2, and the OH would be on 2, making it an enol.

Wait, maybe that's not right. Let me think. Enols are molecules where the alcohol group is on a doubly bonded carbon. Wait, no, that's not possible. Wait, no, enol is an alcohol adjacent to a double bond, so the structure would be like CH2=CHOH. So in the ring, if the double bond is between C1 and C2, the OH would be on C2. So the structure is a cyclopentane ring where C1 and C2 are double-bonded, and C2 has an OH group. Also, there are two methyl groups on C4.

So the molecule is 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-en-2-ol, perhaps. Or maybe it's cyclopent-1-enol with substituents. Wait, maybe the correct IUPAC name is 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol. So the -OH is on C1, but that can't be right because the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the -OH would be on C2, adjacent to the double bond.

Wait, maybe I should get the structure correctly. The enol form implies that the OH is on a carbon adjacent to a double bond. So cyclopent-1-enol would have the double bond from C1 to C2, and the OH on C2. So the structure is a five-membered ring, with double bond between C1 and C2, OH on C2, and two methyl groups on C4.

Now, when you react an enol with bromine, what happens? I'm a bit confused. Let's think about the reactivity. Enols can undergo various additions, but bromine is a dienophile, but wait, in the presence of conjugated dienes, bromine would add via 1,4-addition. But in an enol, which is a conjugated system, perhaps the same applies.

Wait, but wait, the enol has a conjugated diene structure? No, an enol is an alcohol next to a double bond, but in a ring, the conjugation is limited. Alternatively, the enol could be deprotonated to form an enolate, which could react with an electrophile. But the question is just about adding bromine, so maybe it's an addition reaction.

Alternatively, bromine can add to the double bond via a cycloaddition. Wait, but cycloadditions like Diels-Alder require a diene and a dienophile. Alternatively, bromine might add across the double bond in a dihydroxylation, but that's usually with OsO4.

Wait, another possibility: the enol can undergo a conjugate addition. So the bromine would add to the less substituted end because of the enol's structure. Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is an epoxidation, but that's with peracids. So probably not. Another thought: the enol has a conjugated double bond with the OH. So when bromine is added, it could add in a conjugated diene fashion, leading to a diepoxide, but no, that's not bromine.

Wait, another approach. When an enol reacts with bromine, it can lead to the formation of a dibromide. Alternatively, the enol can undergo oxidation. Wait, bromine can act as an oxidizing agent as well.

Wait, the enol, upon addition of Br2, would add across the double bond. So the double bond between C1 and C2 would open up, and Br would add across. But where?

Wait, the enol is a dienol? No, it's a mono-enol. So when bromine adds to a double bond, it's typically an anti addition. So the Br would add to each end of the double bond.

Wait, the starting molecule is 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol, which is a cyclopentenol with two methyl groups on C4. So when Br2 adds to the double bond, it would form 1,2-dibromide. But wait, the structure would then have Br on C1 and C2.

Wait, but the options show some different structures. Let's check the options.

Option A: (1R,2S)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol. So that's adding Br to C1 and C2, and the OH is still present. Hmm, but wait, if we add Br across the double bond, the OH would still be on C2, but the molecule would now have two Brs on C1 and C2.

But wait, the starting material is an enol, so the OH is on C2. After adding Br2, the molecule would have Br on C1 and C2. So the product would have Br-1 and Br-2, with the OH still on C2. But wait, that would result in a diol with two Brs, but the options don't show that. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction isn't just simple addition.

Wait, another possibility: the enol could undergo an oxidation. For example, bromine could oxidize the enol. Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on that. Alternatively, maybe the enol undergoes conjugate addition. Wait, but in a smaller ring like cyclopentenol, the conjugation might not be extensive.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a bromination at the position alpha to the OH. Wait, but the enol is already at that position. Hmm.

Wait, another angle: the enol can tautomerize to the ketone. Because enols can interconvert with ketones via keto-enol tautomerism. So in this case, 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol can become 4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone. Then, if bromine is added, what happens when a ketone reacts with bromine?

Well, ketones can undergo various reactions with bromine. One possibility is that the alpha carbons (the ones adjacent to the carbonyl) can undergo bromination. So, if the enol tautomerizes to a ketone, then the alpha positions (C2 and C5, perhaps) could undergo bromination.

Wait, but wait. Another possibility is that the ketone undergoes addition of bromine. But I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, the ketone could react with bromine in a nucleophilic addition, but I don't think so—bromine is more of an electrophile.

Wait, another thought: when a ketone is treated with bromine, it can undergo a reaction where the alpha carbons are brominated. So, for example, in the presence of an acid catalyst, a bromohydrin can form, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a conjugate addition.

Hmm. Let me think again. The starting material is 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol. If it tautomerizes to the ketone, it would be 4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone. Then, reaction with bromine could be adding to the double bond, but wait, the ketone form doesn't have a double bond. Oh, wait, the enol form has a double bond, the ketone doesn't. So if the enol tautomerizes, the double bond becomes a single bond with an OH group.

So, perhaps the reaction is happening on the enol form, meaning that the double bond is present, and Br2 adds across it. So adding Br across C1 and C2.

But looking at the options, options A and D are 1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol. So they have Br on C1 and C2, and the OH on C2 (since it's cyclopentanol). Wait, but when you add Br2 to the double bond, the OH is still present on C2, so the product would be 1,2-dibromo-2-hydroxycyclopentane, which would be cyclopentanol with Br on C1 and C2.

But looking at the options, option A is (1R,2S)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol. So that structure would have Br on C1 and C2, and the OH on C2, along with two methyl groups on C4.

Hmm, but that would mean that the starting enol, when treated with Br2, would add Br across the double bond, converting it into a vicinal dibromide, while retaining the OH group. So the product would be a vicinal dibromide with the OH group.

But the options also have options B and C where the OH is lost, and the product is a brominated ketone. So which is correct?

Wait, another approach: when an enol reacts with bromine, perhaps the double bond opens up, and Br adds, but the OH might get involved in some way. Alternatively, perhaps the enol adds Br in a conjugate addition.

Alternatively, perhaps the enol is more reactive than the ketone, so the reaction happens in the enol form.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Maybe I should consider the possible products. Let's think about each option.

Option A: 1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol. So OH on C2, Br on C1 and C2.

Option B: 2-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone. So the ketone is formed, and a Br on C2.

Option C: 4-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone. Br on C4, which already has two methyl groups.

Option D: 1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol, but with different stereochemistry.

So, perhaps the reaction is either adding Br to the double bond (turning the enol into a dibromide with OH) or the enol tautomerizes to the ketone, which then undergoes bromination.

Wait, if the enol tautomerizes to the ketone, then the bromine would brominate the alpha position. The ketone is 4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone. The alpha carbons are C3 and C5, perhaps?

Wait, the ketone in this case would be cyclopentanone, with substituents. Since the starting material is 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol, tautomerizing would give 4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone. Then, the alpha carbons would be C2 and C5 (because the carbonyl is on C1, but wait, in a cyclopentanone, the carbonyl is on one of the carbons. Wait, wait, let's clarify.

Actually, in the enol form, the structure would have the double bond between C1 and C2, and the OH on C2. So when it tautomerizes to the ketone, the carbonyl group would be on C2, right? Because the enol form is C=C-OH; tautomerizing would form a ketone on the same carbon where the OH was. So the ketone would be on C2.

Wait, no, wait. The enol structure is C1=C2-OH. So when it tautomerizes, the double bond becomes a single bond, and the OH becomes a carbonyl group. So the ketone would be on C2.

So the structure would be cyclopentanone with the carbonyl on C2, and two methyl groups on C4.

So the molecule would be 4,4-dimethylcyclopentan-2-one.

Now, if this ketone reacts with bromine, where would the bromine add?

In ketones, bromine can add to the carbonyl group, but that would require a different reagent, like H2O2 or something else. Alternatively, bromine can add to the double bond, but the ketone doesn't have a double bond.

Wait, wait a second. Wait, the tautomerization from enol to ketone would remove the double bond. So if the enol is attacked by Br2, the double bond would be the reactive site, leading to addition of Br across C1 and C2, creating a vicinal dibromide with the OH still present. Then, the product would be 1,2-dibromo-2-hydroxy-4,4-dimethylcyclopentane, which would be option A or D.

Alternatively, if the enol tautomerizes to the ketone, then the ketone would have the structure 4,4-dimethylcyclopentan-2-one. Upon reaction with bromine, maybe the alpha carbons (C1 and C3) would undergo bromination. But wait, bromination of ketones typically occurs under acidic conditions, where the alpha hydrogens are protonated, making them more susceptible to attack by an electrophile like Br+.

So, if the ketone is in an acidic environment, the alpha hydrogens (on C1 and C3) would be protonated, making them more reactive. Then, bromine could add as Br+ to the alpha position.

But wait, in the product options, only options B and C have the ketone (since they are cyclopentanone).

Option B is 2-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone. So the Br is on C2, which is the same as the ketone's position. That doesn't make sense because the ketone is on C2, so adding Br there would be on the carbonyl, which is not possible. Unless it's a substitution, but that's not typical.

Wait, maybe the alpha position is C1 and C3. So if bromine adds to an alpha position, like C3, which is adjacent to the carbonyl. Let's see: the ketone is on C2. Then, the adjacent carbons are C1 and C3.

So in option B, the Br is on C2, which is the carbonyl carbon. That's unlikely because you can't brominate a carbonyl carbon without a strong catalyst or under specific conditions.

Option C is 4-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone. That would mean the Br is on C4, which is already substituted with two methyl groups. But adding a Br there would make it 4-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone. So is that possible?

Wait, but in the starting material, the enol is on C2, and when it tautomerizes to the ketone, it's on C2. So the ketone is on C2, which is connected to C1 and C3 in the ring.

So, the alpha carbons would be C1 and C3.

If the ketone undergoes alpha bromination, the Br would add to either C1 or C3. But in the options, neither B nor C show Br on those positions.

Hmm, perhaps I'm going down the wrong path. Let's think again.

Alternative approach: The enol can undergo bromination at the position alpha to the OH group. Since the enol is conjugated, bromine might add to the position where the conjugation is possible.

Wait, but the enol is itself an alpha, beta-unsaturated alcohol. So the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the OH is on C2.

When Br2 is added to an alpha, beta-unsaturated system, it can add in either a 1,2-addition or a 1,4-addition. Wait, but in this case, the system is a cyclopentenol, so adding Br2 across the double bond would be 1,2-addition.

So, the Br would add across C1 and C2, making a 1,2-dibromo compound. The OH would still be on C2.

So the product would be 1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol, which is option A or D.

The difference between A and D is the stereochemistry: A is (1R,2S), D is (1R,2R). So which stereochemistry is correct when adding Br2?

Adding Br2 to a double bond is a stereospecific reaction. The Br atoms add across the double bond with anti stereochemistry. So, the two Brs would be on opposite sides.

But in the given options, the configuration is either R and S (A) or R and R (D). Let's think about the chair conformation or the ring structure.

Wait, the molecule is cyclopentane, which is a five-membered ring. When the Br adds across the double bond, the ring would have two Brs on adjacent carbons, and the OH on C2.

Wait, but how does the stereochemistry work in a ring? Let me imagine the cyclopentene ring with the double bond between C1 and C2, and the OH on C2. When Br2 adds, the Brs would add trans to each other.

So, the resulting structure would have Br on C1 and C2, with trans configuration.

But in a cyclopentane ring, the substituents are in a rigid structure. So the Br on C1 and C2 would be on opposite sides.

So, considering the possible configurations, perhaps the product would have the Brs in a diequatorial or similar arrangement, but I'm not exactly sure about the stereochemistry.

Looking at the options, A is (1R,2S), and D is (1R,2R). So which is correct?

Wait, when adding Br2 across a double bond, the Br adds with anti stereochemistry. So if the starting double bond is in a certain configuration, the Brs will end up opposite.

But in a cyclopentene, the double bond is in a ring, which is a rigid structure. So the addition of Br2 would lead to a trans addition, creating a vicinal dibromide with the Brs on opposite sides.

But in the options, the configurations are given as R and S for A, and R and R for D. How does this come about?

Maybe it's easier to draw the structure. Let's imagine the cyclopentene ring. The double bond is between C1 and C2. The OH is on C2. When Br2 adds, the Brs add across the double bond in a trans fashion.

Assuming the starting double bond is in a certain position, the two Brs would be on opposite sides. So, looking at the ring, the Br on C1 is on one side, and the Br on C2 is on the opposite side.

But how does this translate into R and S configurations?

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to assign the configuration based on the priority of substituents.

But I'm getting stuck on the exact stereochemistry here. Let me think about the possible products again.

If the Br adds across the double bond, the product is a vicinal dibromide. So the product would have two Brs adjacent to each other, and the OH remains on C2.

Looking at the options, both A and D are such products. The difference is whether the stereocenters are R and S or R and R.

Wait, but in a five-membered ring, adding Brs across the double bond would lead to either a cis or trans arrangement. But considering the ring's geometry, perhaps the Brs are trans.

But regardless, the key point is whether the diastereomers are possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the addition of Br2 leads to a single diastereomer because of the ring's rigidity.

But I'm not exactly sure. Given that, perhaps the correct product is option B or C, but that doesn't fit with the addition.

Wait, another possibility: the enol can tautomerize to the ketone, and then undergo bromination at the alpha position. So let's think about that.

If the enol tautomerizes to the ketone (4,4-dimethylcyclopentan-2-one), then the alpha carbons are C1 and C3. Bromine could add to either of these positions.

But looking at the options, option B is 2-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone. That would mean the Br is on the same carbon as the ketone, which is not an alpha position. So that's probably not correct.

Option C is 4-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone. The Br is on C4, which is already substituted with two methyl groups. So that's possible.

Wait, but why would the Br add to C4? Because it's a tertiary carbon, perhaps bromination occurs there more readily? But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a case of allylic bromination, but that's with different conditions.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me go back to the addition of Br2 to the double bond.

The enol has a double bond between C1 and C2, and the OH is on C2. Adding Br2 across the double bond would form a 1,2-dibromide, with the OH still present on C2. So the product would be 1,2-dibromo-2-hydroxy-4,4-dimethylcyclopentane. Looking at the options, that would match options A or D.

Now, the question is about the major outcome. Which is more likely: the addition across the double bond, or the tautomerization followed by bromination?

I think that when an enol is treated with bromine, the primary reaction is the addition across the double bond because the double bond is more reactive than the ketone.

So the product would be a 1,2-dibromo derivative with the OH group.

Now, considering the stereochemistry, when Br2 adds to a double bond, the addition is anti. So the Brs would be on opposite sides of the ring.

In the cyclopentane ring, this would mean that the two Brs are trans to each other. How does that translate to the configuration (R and S) of each center?

Alternatively, perhaps the product would have the Brs in a trans configuration, leading to a specific diastereomer.

Looking at the options, option A is (1R,2S), and option D is (1R,2R). If the addition is anti, then the two Brs would be on opposite sides.

In a cyclopentane ring, the substituents on adjacent carbons would be trans if the ring is in a certain conformation. So, perhaps the Br on C1 is axial and the Br on C2 is equatorial, or vice versa.

But without knowing the exact chair conformation, it's hard to say the exact configuration. However, looking at the options, options A and D are the only possible products from this addition.

Now, looking at the possible diastereomers, which is the more likely product?

Alternatively, perhaps the bromine adds in a way that the OH and one Br are on the same side, but I'm not certain.

Another angle: the enol is a planar structure because of the double bond. Adding Br2 would form a bromonium ion intermediate, leading to the opening of the bromonium ion with anti addition.

But in a ring, the addition would lead to the Brs being on opposite faces. So, in the ring, the Brs are trans.

But how does that affect the configuration of the chiral centers?

Assuming that the starting double bond is in a certain configuration, the addition would lead to specific R/S assignments.

But without a specific model, I think I have to go with the options. Since the question is about the major outcome, perhaps the correct product is (1R,2S), which is option A.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is not an addition but a substitution.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to think of other possibilities.

Wait, another thought: the enol might be more reactive towards electrophilic attack because of the conjugation with the hydroxyl group. So perhaps the OH group participates in the reaction.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, the enol could lose a proton to form a conjugated base, which then reacts with Br2. But I don't know.

Another possibility: the enol could undergo a ring-opening reaction, but that's more typical of epoxides.

Wait, but the options don't suggest a ring-opening. So perhaps the initial idea was correct: the product is a 1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol.

So, considering all that, the major product would be option A or D, depending on the stereochemistry.

Now, looking at the options, option A is (1R,2S) and option D is (1R,2R). Which one is correct.

Wait, perhaps the addition leads to a trans-diepoxide, but that's with another reagent.

Alternatively, perhaps the bromine adds with the same stereochemistry.

Wait, perhaps I can think about the configuration. Let's imagine the double bond in the enol is in a certain geometry. When Br2 adds, the two Brs add anti.

So, if the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the OH is on C2, then adding Br across would result in Br on C1 and C2, each on opposite sides.

So, looking at the structure, if the OH is on C2 in a certain configuration, then the Br on C2 would be on the opposite side.

But without knowing the exact starting configuration, it's tricky. However, perhaps the product would have the Brs in a trans configuration, leading to specific R and S assignments.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a racemic mixture, but the options don't mention that.

In any case, based on the options given, the most likely product is either A or D.

Wait, perhaps another approach. In the enol form, the double bond is between C1 and C2. When Br2 adds, the product is 1,2-dibromide.

In the starting material, the OH is on C2. The addition of Br would lead to the following structure: cyclopentane with Br on C1 and C2, and OH on C2, plus two methyl groups on C4.

So, the molecule would have three substituents on C2: Br, OH, and the ring.

Wait, no, the OH is on C2, and Br is added to C1 and C2. So C2 would have Br and OH, and two ring bonds. C1 would have two Brs and two ring bonds.

Wait, no. Each carbon in a cyclopentane ring is bonded to two other carbons in the ring. So C1 is bonded to C5 and C2. So when Br adds to C1, it's in addition to those two ring bonds. So each of C1 and C2 would have two Brs? No, wait, each would have one Br.

Wait, no, each Br is added to a different carbon. So C1 and C2 each have one Br, plus their ring bonds and any other substituents.

So, C2 has the OH group, a Br, and is connected to C1 and C3 in the ring.

Now, determining the configuration (R or S) for each chiral center.

For C1: substituents are Br, two ring carbons (C5 and C2), and the other ring bonds would be to C2 and C5.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to imagine the molecule in a certain way. Let's say the cyclopentane ring is drawn with C1 at the top, connected to C2 and C5. C2 is connected to C1, C3, and has an OH and a Br.

But without a specific model, it's hard to assign the exact configuration, but perhaps the answer is option A.

Alternatively, perhaps the bromine adds to the less substituted position, but in this case, both positions are equally substituted.

Wait, I'm not making progress. I think the correct answer is either A or D, but I'm not certain. However, based on the addition of Br2, the product would have vicinal dibromide with the OH group. Hence, options A and D are the only possibilities. The other options involve the ketone, which would require the enol to tautomerize first, which may not be the major pathway.

So, considering that, I think the major product is the addition product, which is either A or D.

Now, looking at the options, the difference between A and D is the configuration at C2. A is (1R,2S), D is (1R,2R).

Wait, perhaps in the addition, the Brs add with anti stereochemistry, leading to a trans arrangement. So, if C1 has R configuration, then C2 would have S or R?

Alternatively, perhaps the two Brs are on opposite sides, leading to a trans arrangement, which would require that the configurations are opposite.

So, in that case, option A (1R,2S) would be correct.

Alternatively, if both Brs are on the same face, the configurations would be the same, but that would be a cis addition, which is not typical for Br2.

So, I think the correct answer is option A.


The reaction involves 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol with bromine (Br₂). The molecule is an enol, meaning it has a hydroxyl group (-OH) on a carbon adjacent to a double bond. The structure of 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol consists of a five-membered cyclopentane ring with a double bond between C1 and C2, an -OH group on C2, and two methyl groups on C4.

When bromine reacts with an enol, the double bond is highly reactive due to its conjugation with the hydroxyl group. Bromine adds across the double bond in a stereospecific manner, following anti addition. This results in the formation of a vicinal dibromide, where bromine atoms are added to C1 and C2. The hydroxyl group on C2 remains unaffected during this addition.

The product of this reaction is 1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol, with the bromine atoms on C1 and C2 in a trans configuration due to the anti addition mechanism. The stereochemistry of the product is determined by the relative positions of the substituents on the cyclopentane ring. Among the given options, the correct stereochemical configuration is (1R,2S), as this corresponds to the anti addition of bromine across the double bond.

Critical analysis of the options:
- **Option A**: (1R,2S)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol. This matches the expected product based on anti addition of bromine and the resulting stereochemistry.
- **Option B**: 2-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone. This suggests the enol tautomerized to a ketone and bromination occurred, but this is unlikely as the reaction conditions favor addition to the double bond.
- **Option C**: 4-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone. This implies bromination at C4 after tautomerization to a ketone, which is not consistent with the reaction mechanism.
- **Option D**: (1R,2R)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol. This stereochemistry does not align with the anti addition mechanism of bromine.

Thus, the major outcome of the reaction is (1R,2S)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol.

Answer: A
