Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read it again.

The question is about Substance X, which incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. It reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing a gas W. The gas W has a molecule where the number of neutrons and protons are the same. Then a precipitate G forms, which when heated releases B. The melting point of B is close to 277 K. Also, the product of a keto acid reacting with X has two oxygen atoms. X and its analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry.

So, let's break it down. I'll need to figure out what X, Y, W, G, and B are, and then find the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X.

First, thinking about the reaction: X reacts with Y violently, producing gas W and precipitate G. When G is heated, B is released. B's melting point is around 277 K. Wait, what's the melting point of common substances at that temperature? Water freezes at 273 K (0°C), so 277 K is about 4°C. Maybe B is something like ice? But wait, melting point, not boiling. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe B is some kind of metal or solid. Let me think again. Wait, 277 K is about 4 degrees Celsius. So what's a solid that melts around there? Maybe something like elemental sulfur? No, sulfur's melting point is higher. Or perhaps it's a different compound. Alternatively, maybe B is a diatomic molecule, like O2 or N2, but those are gases. Wait, maybe B is a solid at room temperature but melts around that point. Wait, maybe B is a metal, like mercury? No, mercury is liquid at room temp. Wait, maybe B is a solid like a salt? Or perhaps the product is something else.

Wait, let me think about the precipitate G. When G is heated, it releases B. So maybe G is a carbonate or another compound that decomposes upon heating. For example, if G is a carbonate, heating it might release CO2. Wait, but B is the product. So if G is sodium carbonate, heating might not change it much, but if it's sodium bicarbonate, heating would release CO2 and leave Na2CO
