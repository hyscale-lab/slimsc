Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this organic chemistry problem. Let me read through the question again carefully.

The problem says that compound X, with the formula C11H12O, is reacted with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. Then, the resulting product's 1H and 13C NMR spectra are given, and I need to identify what compound X was from the options.

Hmm, what do I know about 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane? Oh right, that's a type of catalyst used in the epoxidation of alkenes. Specifically, it's a phase-transfer catalyst that's used in the Prilezhaev or epoxidation reaction, where an alkene is converted into an epoxide using a peracid. Wait, but here the solvent is nonpolar, so maybe the reaction is under basic conditions or something else. Or perhaps in this case, the catalyst is helping the epoxidation by providing a base or something.

But wait, the starting material is compound X, which after reaction gives a product with specific NMR signals. So the product is an epoxide, I think, because the reagent is involved in epoxidation. So the product would be an epoxide formed from an alkene in X.

Looking at the options: all of them are oxiranes (epoxides). So the product is the epoxide version of compound X. So the question is, what was the starting alkene that, upon epoxidation, gives the product with the given NMR data.

So the product is an epoxide, which would show specific signals in the NMR. Let's analyze the NMR data.

Starting with the 1H NMR:

Î´ 2.28 (3H, s), 2.31 (3H, s): Two singlets, each integrating to 3H. These are likely methyl groups attached to something deshielded, maybe carbonyl groups or aromatic rings. Wait, but in epoxides, the protons on the oxygen are usually deshielded and appear around 3-5 ppm, but as broad singlets or something. Alternatively, it could be methyl groups attached to carbonyls or aromatic rings.

Wait, but in the product
