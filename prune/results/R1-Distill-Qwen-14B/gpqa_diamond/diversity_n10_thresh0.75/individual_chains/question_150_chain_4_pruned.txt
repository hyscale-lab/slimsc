Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me try to think through it step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it slow.

The question provides a compound with the molecular formula C8H9NO and an NMR spectrum. Then, it's reacted through a series of reagents. I need to figure out what the final product is from the options given.

First, let's look at the NMR data to figure out the structure of the starting compound. The 1H NMR is given as:

- 9.72 ppm (t, 1H)
- 6.98 ppm (d, 2H)
- 6.51 ppm (d, 2H)
- 6.27 ppm (bs, 2H)
- 3.66 ppm (d, 2H)

I remember that aromatic protons typically appear in the range of 6.5-8.5 ppm. The triplet at 9.72 ppm is high, so that's probably an aldehyde proton (-CHO). Aldehydes usually show up around 9-10 ppm. So the compound likely has an aldehyde group.

Looking at the aromatic region: 6.98 (d, 2H) and 6.51 (d, 2H). These look like two sets of doublets, each integrating to 2H. That's a classic pattern for a para-substituted aromatic ring. The coupling suggests that each pair is adjacent to each other. So maybe two phenyl groups attached to something else.

The 6.27 ppm (bs, 2H) probably isn't aromatic. A broad signal could be due to an -OH group or maybe some vinyl protons. But wait, if it's a double, maybe it's part of a conjugated system. Alternatively, maybe it's a pair of protons on a carbon adjacent to an oxygen, like in a diol or something.

The 3.66 ppm (d, 2H) is a singlet for two protons. Maybe a methylene group (CH2) attached to an electronegative atom like oxygen. Since it's a double, perhaps it's CH2-O, like an ether or an ester? Or maybe it's part of an amide, but the molecular formula has N, so there's an N somewhere.

Putting this together: the compound has an aldehyde group (from the 9.72 ppm peak), two phenyl groups (each para-substituted, as per the doublets), and some other groups. Let's see what the molecular formula tells us.

Molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, X=0 (no halogens), N=1.

So: (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9+1)/2= (10)/2=5.

So five degrees of unsaturation: which could be a ring and some double bonds. For example, a benzene ring (3 DoU) plus an aldehyde (1 DoU) and maybe an ester or an amide (another DoU). Or another way: two benzene rings? No, because two benzene rings would be 6 DoU, which is more than 5. So probably one benzene ring, and other double bonds or rings.

Wait, but looking at the NMR, there are two aromatic regions: 6.98 and 6.51. That suggests two benzene rings, each with substituents. So perhaps two para-substituted phenyl groups connected via some chain.

So the structure might have two phenyl rings attached to something else. Let's think about how the other signals fit in.

The 3.66 ppm (d, 2H) could be a CH2 group connected to an oxygen, maybe an ester or ether. The 6.27 ppm (bs, 2H) could be part of a conjugated system, like an enol or a vinyl group.

Putting it all together, perhaps the structure is something like an aldehyde attached to a chain that has two phenyl groups and an oxygen-containing group.

Wait, another thought. The NMR shows 6.27 (bs, 2H) which could be a pair of protons on a carbon adjacent to an oxygen, such as in a dienol or a conjugated diol. Alternatively, maybe it's a pair of protons on a carbon next to an aromatic ring, as in a vinyl group.

Alternatively, the 6.27 could be a pair of protons on an enol, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: Let's try to determine the structure step by step.

The aldehyde at 9.72 ppm is probably a terminal aldehyde. So the compound has a CHO group.

Looking at the aromatic regions: two doublets, each integrating to 2H. If each is a pair of protons, maybe each is part of a para-substituted benzene. So perhaps the structure has two para-substituted phenyl groups attached to a central chain.

The 6.27 (bs, 2H) could be a pair of protons on a carbon adjacent to the aldehyde, like in an alpha, beta-unsaturated aldehyde. So maybe the structure is a cinnamaldehyde derivative. But cinnamaldehyde is benzalacetophenone? No, wait, cinnamaldehyde is Ph-CH2-CHO. No, wait, that's not right. Cinnamaldehyde is Ph-CH2-CHO. Wait, no, actually cinnamaldehyde is Ph-CH=CH-CHO. No, wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, it's an aromatic group attached via a double bond to a chain.

Wait, perhaps the structure is something like (Ph)CH=CH-CHO. Let me think. If that's the case, the NMR would show the aldehyde (9.72), the vinyl protons (maybe around 6.27 as a triplet or something else?), and the aromatic protons.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a benzaldehyde derivative with substituents.

Wait, let's think about the possible structure that would give the NMR signals.

Another approach: So, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's calculate the possible functional groups.

Nitrogen could be part of an amide, amine, nitrile, or something else. But looking at the NMR, there's no obvious nitrile (which is usually around 1-3 ppm for CH2 groups adjacent to it, or higher for the nitrile itself). The compound has an aldehyde, so that's one functional group.

Wait, maybe the structure is an aldehyde with two phenyl groups attached via a chain that includes an oxygen. Let's think of something like an aldehyde with two benzene rings attached via a carbonyl group or an ether.

Wait, perhaps the structure is an aldehyde with two aryl groups connected via a propyl chain or something. Alternatively, maybe it's an aldehyde attached to a ring-opened epoxide or something else.

Wait, let's think about the integration. The downfield peaks:

- 9.72 (1H)
- 6.98 (2H)
- 6.51 (2H)
- 6.27 (2H)
- 3.66 (2H)

So, the molecule has 1H (probably the aldehyde), then 2H in two different aromatic regions, and 2H in another region.

Wait, let's think about the integration. The molecule has 8 carbons. Let's count the signals:

Aldehyde: 1C (CHO)
Aromatic signals: 6C (since each doublet is 2H, and for two rings, that's 4C, but wait each ring is para-substituted, so each has two substituents. Wait, perhaps each ring is attached to a substituent. Let's see.

Alternatively, maybe it's a structure where two phenyl groups are attached to a central chain, which also has an aldehyde and an oxygen-containing group.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a di-substituted benzaldehyde with another substituent. Alternatively, maybe it's a substituted cinnamaldehyde.

Wait, another thought: the 6.27 ppm (2H, bs) could be protons on a carbonyl group. But more likely, perhaps, those are allylic protons or part of a conjugated system.

Let me try to imagine the structure: perhaps it's an aldehyde with two benzene rings attached to a chain that includes an oxygen. For example, something like Ph-O-CH2-CH2-CHO? No, but that would have more H's.

Wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's calculate the possible functional groups.

Wait, another approach: think about the reagents given. The reaction steps are:

1. NaNO2 + HCl
2. H2O
3. Aq. KOH, heat

NaNO2 and HCl are typically used in diazotization reactions. So, this is probably a Sandmeyer reaction or something similar. Wait, but after diazotization, the next step is H2O, which is just aqueous workup. Then, treatment with aqueous KOH and heat. Hmm, maybe it's a hydrolysis reaction.

Wait, but wait, the initial compound has an N in its molecular formula. So after a diazotization reaction, perhaps the amine is converted into a diazonium salt, which then undergoes some reaction. But in this case, since the next step is water, perhaps it's a hydrolysis. Or maybe a substitution reaction.

Wait, but the starting compound has an N. Let's think: the starting molecule has a formula C8H9NO. So, that's 8 carbons, 9 hydrogens, one nitrogen, and one oxygen.

If the starting compound has an amino group, then the
