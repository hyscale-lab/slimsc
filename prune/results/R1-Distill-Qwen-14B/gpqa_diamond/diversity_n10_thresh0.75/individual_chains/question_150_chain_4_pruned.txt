Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it my best shot.

The question involves a compound with the molecular formula C8H9NO. The NMR data is provided, and it's subjected to a series of reactions. I need to determine the final product from the given options.

First, I'll try to analyze the NMR data to figure out the structure of the starting compound. Let's look at each peak:

- 9.72 ppm (t, 1H): That's a triplet around 9.7 ppm. Triplet suggests coupling with two neighboring protons. High ppm like that often indicates an aldehyde proton. But wait, aldehyde protons usually appear around 9-10 ppm as a singlet. Wait, maybe it's an acidic proton like an aldehyde. Or maybe a conjugated aldehyde. Alternatively, it could be an NH proton, but 9.7 seems high for an NH. Or perhaps it's an enol proton? Hmm, maybe not. Let me think. Another possibility is an aromatic proton, but the triplet might suggest something else.

- 6.98 ppm (d, 2H): A doublet integrating for 2H. This could be from an aromatic ring, perhaps para-substituted. Because in a para-substituted benzene, the protons are equivalent and give a doublet if coupled to two adjacent protons. Alternatively, it could be from a vinyl group with coupling. Wait, but 6.98 is lower than typical benzene protons. Maybe it's an aromatic ring with substituents causing the shift.

- 6.51 ppm (d, 2H): Another doublet, 2H. Hmm. Maybe another aromatic ring. If the two doublets are separated, maybe there are two different aromatic rings. For example, if the molecule has two benzene rings with substituents. Alternatively, maybe one ring is more deshielded than the other. Let me think about the coupling: each of these could be two protons in a di-substituted ring, perhaps in a trans configuration.

- 6.27 ppm (bs, 2H): Broad singlet integrating for 2H. Broad suggests exchange with something, maybe an -OH proton, but then the integration is 2. Alternatively,
