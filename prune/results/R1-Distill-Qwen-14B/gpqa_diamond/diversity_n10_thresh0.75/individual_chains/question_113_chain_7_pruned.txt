Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to find out the correct chemical formula of an unknown compound based on the given spectroscopy data. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I'll look at each of the characterization techniques mentioned: FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. Each of these provides different clues about the structure of the compound.

Starting with the FTIR spectrum. A very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm⁻¹ usually indicates O-H stretching. That broad peak is typical for alcohols or maybe carboxylic acids, but since it's broad, I think it's either an alcohol or maybe an acid. But wait, in the case of carboxylic acids, the O-H peak is usually even broader and around that same region. Hmm, but also, the question mentions other strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. Let me think: 1700 is a strong peak which could be a carbonyl group, like a ketone or aldehyde, or maybe an ester or carboxylic acid. The 1650 peak is a bit lower, which might suggest maybe an aromatic ring with conjugation, or perhaps an amide? Or maybe it's a conjugated carbonyl, like an alpha, beta-unsaturated ketone or something similar.

Wait, but looking back, the 1H NMR shows peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones attached to a double bond, like in alkenes. So the compound likely has a double bond. So, maybe the 1650 peak is due to conjugation between the carbonyl and the double bond. Like in a ketone with an adjacent double bond. So that would make the carbonyl part of, say, a cyclohexenone structure or something similar.

So, putting that together, the compound might have a carbonyl group (like a ketone) and a double bond nearby, making that 1650 peak a C=C stretch in conjugation with the carbonyl.

Next, the mass spectrum shows a fragment peak at m/z=45. I need to think about what fragments could give that. 45 is a common mass for certain functional groups. For example, the
