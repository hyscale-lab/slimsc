Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question is about identifying an unknown compound using its FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry data. The options given are four different chemical formulas: C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, and C6H12O. I need to determine which one it is based on the spectral data provided.

Alright, let's break down each piece of data and see what clues they give us.

First, the FTIR spectrum shows a very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm⁻¹. Broad peaks in IR usually indicate O-H stretching, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. Wait, but it's a very broad peak. I remember that O-H in carboxylic acids is broader than in alcohols because of hydrogen bonding. So maybe this compound has a carboxylic acid group or maybe an alcohol?

Then, there are two other strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. Hmm, where do these peaks come from? I know that the carbonyl group (C=O) absorbs around 1700 cm⁻¹. The 1650 peak is a bit lower, which might correspond to conjugated carbonyl groups, maybe an ester or something with resonance. Wait, another possibility is that it's an aromatic ring with conjugated double bonds, but that's usually a bit lower or in a different region. Alternatively, the 1650 could be a conjugated carbonyl, like an ester, or perhaps an amide, but I don't think that's in the options here. Let me think about the possible structures.

Next, the 1H NMR shows peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones attached to a double bond, like in alkenes. So the molecule must have a double bond, perhaps an alkene. Also, the presence of multiple peaks suggests perhaps a substituted double bond, maybe in a ring or part of a conjugated system.

Looking at the Mass Spectrometry data: there's a fragment peak at m/z = 45. I'm trying to think what that could be. 45 is a common mass for a fragment. For example, the methyl group (CH3) is 15, but 45 could come from something else. Wait, the molecular ion could break down in a way that produces a fragment of 45. Let's see, 45 is the molecular weight of C3H7O? Or wait, maybe it's a ketene ion or something else. Alternatively, 45 could correspond to a CH2CH2O group, but maybe more likely, the 45 is a common fragment, like from an ethyl group attached to an oxygen, like an ethyl group in ethyl acetate or something. Or perhaps it's a propyl group, but I'm not sure. Hmm.

Let me think about the possible structures for each formula and how they fit the data.

The options are:

A) C6H12O2
B) C6H10O
C) C6H
