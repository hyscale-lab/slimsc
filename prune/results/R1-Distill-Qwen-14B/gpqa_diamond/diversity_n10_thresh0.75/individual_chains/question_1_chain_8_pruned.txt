Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this quantum mechanics question. Hmm, let's see what the question is about. So, we have two energy states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds respectively. We need to find the energy difference that would allow us to clearly distinguish between these two levels.

Wait, I remember something about the uncertainty principle in quantum mechanics. Oh right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. It states that you can't simultaneously know both the energy and the lifetime of a particle with infinite precision. The formula is ΔE * Δt ≥ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant.

So, the idea here is that the product of the energy uncertainty and the lifetime (time uncertainty) must be at least ħ/2. If the energy difference is too small, the uncertainty would be larger than the actual difference, making it impossible to distinguish the two states.

Let me write down the formula to clarify. So, ΔE = ħ / (2Δt). Here, Δt is the uncertainty in time, which in this case would relate to the lifetimes of the states. But wait, the lifetimes given are T1 = 1e-9 s and T2 = 1e-8 s. I'm not entirely sure, but maybe I should consider the minimum uncertainty for the smaller lifetime because the energy difference has to be detectable above the uncertainty from both states?

Wait, no, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the uncertainty in energy for each state and ensure that the actual energy difference is larger than the sum of these uncertainties. Because if the energy difference is smaller than the uncertainties, the two states might overlap, making them indistinguishable.

Alternatively, maybe I should think that the energy resolution is determined by the uncertainty related to the shorter lifetime? Because the shorter the lifetime, the larger the uncertainty in energy. So
