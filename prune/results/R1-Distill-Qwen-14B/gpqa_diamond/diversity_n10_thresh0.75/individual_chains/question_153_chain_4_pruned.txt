Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry question here about the Michael reaction. Hmm, I need to figure out the reactants and products for three different reactions. Let's take it step by step.

First, I remember that the Michael reaction is a nucleophilic addition to an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. The nucleophile attacks the beta position, creating a new carbon-carbon bond and forming an enolate intermediate. The conditions usually involve a base, which deprotonates the alpha position to generate the nucleophilic enolate.

Looking at the first reaction: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate with NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) and EtOH. So, NaOEt is a strong base, acting as a base to deprotonate the alpha position. Dimethyl malonate is the nucleophile here because it's a good one. The other reactant is the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl; methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate.

Wait, wait. Wait, dimethyl malonate is a diester. Its structure is CH2(CO2Me)2. It has two ester groups, and the central carbon is the alpha and beta carbons. So, when the base (NaOEt) deprotonates the alpha carbon, the enolate forms. The enolate would have a negative charge on the central carbon, making it nucleophilic.

The other component is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Structure-wise, that's CH2=CH-C(O)OCH3, but the p-tolyl group is attached to one of the carbons. Let me think, the acrylate is E configuration, so the substituents on either side of the double bond are opposite. So, the structure is CH2=C(p-tolyl)-CO2Me? Or wait, no. Wait, 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate: the acrylate is CH2=CH-CO2Me, but the substituent is on the third carbon. Wait, maybe the numbering is different. Alternatively, perhaps it's CH2=C(p-tolyl)CO2Me. Wait, no, acrylate is CH
