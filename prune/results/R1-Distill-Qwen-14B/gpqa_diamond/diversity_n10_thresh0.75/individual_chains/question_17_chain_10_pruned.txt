Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it's about the concentration of calcium ions in a solution with a Ca-EDTA complex. I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, right? It binds metal ions like calcium.

The question says the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M. Oh, wait, and the pH is ideal, so I don't have to worry about the EDTA protonation states or anything like that. Temperature is 25°C, and the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10. Oh, right, the formation constant is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex.

So, I think the reaction here is something like Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-. The formation constant K is equal to [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]). So K is given as 5e10.

Wait, but in the solution, the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. So the initial concentration of CaEDTA^2- is 0.02 M. Let me think about how to find [Ca²+].

Let me denote [CaEDTA^2-] as C, which is 0.02 M. The K expression is K = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]). But wait, in the solution, the EDTA is in the form of EDTA^4- because pH is ideal, right? So the [EDTA^4-] is essentially the same as the free EDTA concentration.

Wait, but when the complex is formed, the EDTA is tied up in the complex. So the total EDTA in solution is the sum of free EDTA and the EDTA in the complex. However, I think in the case where the formation constant is very large (which it is here, 5e10), the amount of free EDTA would be negligible. So [EDTA^4-] is approximately equal to the concentration of the complex divided by K? Hmm, maybe not. Let me think again.

Wait, no. Let's model this. The initial concentration of Ca-EDTA is 0.02 M. Let's assume that some of it dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-. Let x be the concentration of Ca²+.

So, the complex concentration will be 0.02 - x, but since K is large, x would be very small, so 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

Wait, but K is 5e10, which is huge, so the complex is almost completely formed. So the dissociation is minimal. So the concentration of the complex is approximately 0.02 M, and the concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA^4- are both x.

Wait, wait, no. Let me think. The reaction is Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2- ; K = 5e10.

So, the initial concentrations are: [Ca²+] = 0, [EDTA^4-] = 0, and [CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 M.

At equilibrium, the changes would be: [CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 - x (but x is tiny, so 0.02 is good enough).

[Ca²+] = x, [EDTA^4-] = x.

So plug into K:

K = (0.02) / (x * x) = 5e10.

So, solving for x: x² = 0.02 / (5e10) → x² = 4e-13 → x = sqrt(4e-13) → x= 2e-6.5? Wait, wait, sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5? Wait, 4e-13 is 4 * 1e-13, so square root is sqrt(4)=2 times 1e-6.5. Oh wait, 1e-13 is (1e-6.5)^2. So sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5, which is 2 * 1e-6.5. Let's compute 10^(-6.5). 10^-6 is 1e-6, 10^-7 is 1e-7. So 10^-6.5 is about 3.16e-7. So 2 * 3.16e-7 is approximately 6.32e-7. Wait, that's about 6.3e-7 M. Hmm, looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-
