Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm kinda new to this, but I'll try to work through it. The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Let's see what the problem says.

The problem states that the solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. They also mention that the pH is ideal, which probably means that the solution conditions are such that the EDTA is in its correct form to complex with Ca²+. The temperature is 25°C, which is room temperature. The K for the Ca-EDTA complex is given as 5x10^10. The options are A to D, with various concentrations.

Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, and it forms complexes with metal ions. The formation constant, K, tells us how strong the complex is. A higher K means the complex is more stable, right? So, K is the equilibrium constant for the reaction where EDTA binds to the metal ion.

The reaction should be something like Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA²-. Since the problem gives me the concentration of the complex, which is 0.02 M, I think I can set up an equilibrium expression.

Wait, wait. The initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. But since it's a 1:1 complex (because it's stoichiometric), the complex dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA^4- in solution.

So, the dissociation would be: CaEDTA²- ↔ Ca²+ + EDTA^4-

The formation constant K is given by [Ca²+][EDTA^4-]/[CaEDTA²-]. So, K = 5e10.

But wait, when the complex dissociates, the concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA^4- should be the same, right? Because for each mole of complex that dissociates, you get one mole each of Ca²+ and EDTA^4-.

So, let me define the change. Let's say the concentration of Ca²+ is x. Then the concentration of EDTA^4- is also x, and the concentration of the complex is 0.02 - x. But wait, if K is so large, 5e10, that's a huge value. That suggests that the complex is very stable and doesn't dissociate much. So x would be very small compared to 0.02.

So, I can approximate that [CaEDTA²-] ≈ 0.02 M, and [Ca²+] and [EDTA^4-] are both x. So plugging into the K expression:

K = (x)(x) / 0.02 ≈ 5e10

So x² / 0.02 = 5e10 → x² = 5e10 * 0.02 → 5e10 * 2e-2 = 1e9.

Wait, 0.02 is 2e-2. So 5e10 * 2e-2 equals 1e9. So x squared is 1e9. Taking square roots, x is sqrt(1e9) = 3.16e4 M? Wait, that can't be right. Because 3e4 M is way higher than the initial concentration of 0.02 M. That would mean that almost all the complex dissociates, which contradicts the large K value. Oh wait, wait, no. Wait a minute.

Wait, I think I messed up. Let me re-do that. K is 5e10. So, K = [Ca²+][EDTA^4-]/[CaEDTA²-] ≈ x^2 / 0.02 =5e10.

So x squared = 5e10 * 0.02 = 1e9. So x is sqrt(1e9) = 3.16e4 M. But that's impossible because the complex is only 0.02 M. So x can't be 3e4 M. Which suggests that the assumption that [CaEDTA²-] is approximately
