Okay, so I have this question about which molecule has C3h symmetry. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my symmetry concepts, but let's try to think through this.

First, I remember that symmetry elements include things like axes, planes, and centers of inversion. C3h symmetry suggests a three-fold axis with a horizontal mirror plane. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the notation can be a bit tricky. Oh right, C3h would mean a three-fold rotation axis (C3) combined with a horizontal mirror plane (σh). So the molecule should have a three-fold symmetry and a mirror plane perpendicular to that axis.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A: Triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone.

Option B: Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone.

Option C: Triisopropyl borate.

Option D: Quinuclidine.

Wait, I've heard that certain bicyclic molecules have high symmetry. Let's go through each option.

Option C: Triisopropyl borate. The structure is something like (i-Pr)3B(O)(something? Wait, triisopropyl borate would be B with three O-i-Pr groups? So the molecule is (O(C(CH2)3))3B. Is that symmetric? Since all three substituents are isopropyl groups, and the boron is in the center. So the molecule would have a trigonal planar arrangement around boron. Wait, but the groups are all the same, so that would give a C3 axis. Does it have a horizontal mirror plane? Well, if the molecule is non-polar, maybe, but I'm not entirely sure. Wait, the symmetry here: if the three substituents are identical and arranged symmetrically, the molecule would have C3v symmetry, perhaps. Or maybe C3h? Hmm, I'm a bit confused here.

Option D: Quinuclidine. I remember that quinuclidine is a bicyclic molecule, like a bridge structure. Its structure is bicyclo[2.2.2]octane. Oh, wait, no, quinuclidine is more like bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane. Wait, no, wait, no—I think quinuclidine is bicyclo[2.2.2]octane. Wait, no, isn't it bicyclo[2.2.2]? Or is that adamantane? Wait, quinuclidine is a bicyclo[2.2.2]octane derivative. I think it has a chair-like structure. But what about its symmetry? It has a three-fold axis, perhaps? Let me visualize it. Quinuclidine's structure has three bridges, each with two carbons, making a tricyclic structure. Wait, no, the bicyclo[2.2.2]octane system has three bridges, each of two carbons, making a triangular structure. So, would that have a C3 symmetry? I think that's the case. Because if you can rotate it 120 degrees around the central axis and it looks the same, that's C3. But does it also have a horizontal mirror plane? Hmm. So, the molecule would have a C3 axis. If it's in a chair-like conformation, maybe it doesn't have a mirror plane. Wait, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe quinuclidine has a three-fold axis but no mirror plane, so it's C3, not C3h.

Wait, another thought: C3h would require both a three-fold rotation and a horizontal mirror plane. So, I need to see if any of these molecules have that.

Option A: Triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran... Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let's break it down. It's an annulene with three fused furan rings attached to a triphenylene group. Wait, the triphenylene part is a three-phenyl group connected in a ring, perhaps. So, the triphenylene moiety is a tricyclic system with three benzene rings connected in a symmetrical way. If the molecule has three similar substituents arranged symmetrically, perhaps it has a C3h symmetry.

Option B: Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-... So, this is a molecule where a benzo group is fused with a trifuran system. The substituents on the furan rings are such that they form a symmetric arrangement. If the substituents around the central three-fused rings are symmetrically placed, it might have C3h symmetry.

Wait, perhaps I should think about each molecule's structure and symmetry:

1. Triphenyleno...trifuran: The triphenylene part is a symmetric structure. If the three benzene rings are arranged in a way that each is attached to a central ring, then the molecule would have three-fold symmetry. If it's connected to a trifuran, which itself is symmetric, perhaps the whole molecule has C3h symmetry.

2. Benzo...trifuran: The benzo group is fused to the trifuran. But in this case, the substituents are probably in a way that doesn't give three-fold symmetry. Maybe two substituents are on one side, but I'm not sure.

3. Triisopropyl borate: As I thought earlier, it's a central boron with three isopropyl groups. The molecule is planar around B, but wait, the isopropyl groups are themselves in a trigonal planar arrangement? No, wait, each isopropyl group is in a plane, but the overall arrangement around boron is trigonal planar. So, the molecule would have a three-fold rotation axis (C3), but would it have a horizontal mirror plane? Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps it's C3v symmetry, which would have a C3 axis and a vertical mirror plane, but that's different from C3h.

Wait, no. The point group for C3h would require a horizontal mirror plane. So, the molecule must be symmetrical across a plane that's perpendicular to the C3 axis. For triisopropyl borate, each substituent is in the same plane around B, so maybe it's C3v, but not C3h. Because the mirror plane in C3h is horizontal, meaning perpendicular to the rotation axis. Wait, wait, in C3h, the mirror plane is horizontal, so perhaps the molecule is symmetric when viewed along that plane.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the terms. Let me think: C3h's character includes a three-fold axis and a horizontal mirror plane. So, for example, a propeller shape with three blades arranged symmetrically would have C3h symmetry. So, if the molecule has three identical substituents arranged symmetrically around a central point, and a mirror plane cutting through them, then it has C3h.

Looking again at triisopropyl borate. The three isopropyl groups are arranged around the boron. Each is a substituent, and they're all the same. So, if you rotate 120 degrees, the molecule looks the same. So the C3 axis is present. Now, does it have a horizontal mirror plane? Let's imagine a mirror plane that cuts through the boron and is perpendicular to the plane of the substituents. Wait, if the substituents are all in a trigonal planar arrangement, then a horizontal mirror plane would lie along the plane of the substituents. Wait, no, the mirror plane in C3h is perpendicular to the C3 axis. So, if the C3 axis is along the z-axis, the mirror plane would be in the xy-plane. So, for triisopropyl borate, the substituents are all in the same plane (maybe the xy-plane), and the mirror plane is the same as that plane. So, would that be a σh (horizontal) mirror plane? Hmm, perhaps. So, in that case, the molecule would have C3h symmetry. Or is that C3v? Wait, no, C3v has a vertical mirror plane. So I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, let me think of the trigonal planar structure. The mirror plane would pass through the central atom (B) and a substituent, perhaps. But that would be a vertical mirror plane, leading to C3v symmetry. But in C3h, the mirror plane is σh, which is horizontal. So, maybe triisopropyl borate has a three-fold axis but lacks a horizontal mirror plane, which would make it C3, not C3h.

Wait, but another thought: if the molecule is non-polar, perhaps it's symmetric across a plane. But I'm not sure.

Let's move to quinuclidine. Quinuclidine is a bicyclic molecule, bicyclo[2.2.2]octane. Its structure is like a cube corner. I think it has a three-fold axis because each bridge is identical. So, rotating 120 degrees would map the molecule onto itself. Now, does it have a horizontal mirror plane? If the molecule is symmetric when reflected across a plane that's perpendicular to the three-fold axis, then yes. But quinuclidine, in its chair-like conformation, might not have a plane that acts as a mirror. Alternatively, perhaps it's in a different conformation where the mirror plane exists. Wait, I'm not certain. I think that quinuclidine has a C3 axis but doesn't have a mirror plane, so it's C3, not C3h.

Now, looking at the other options:

Option B: Benzo…trifuran. The benzo group is fused to a trifuran. The trifuran has three furan rings connected in a symmetric way. Wait, the benzo group is a single ring, so perhaps the substitution is not symmetric. So maybe this molecule has lower symmetry.

Option A: Triphenyleno...trifuran. Triphenylene is a tricyclic system of three benzene rings connected in a symmetrical way. So, the molecule has a central triphenylene ring, which would have a three-fold symmetry. Then, it's attached to a trifuran. So the entire molecule would have three-fold symmetry. Let me think: if each of the three phenyl groups is attached to the trifuran in the same way, then the molecule would have three-fold rotation and a mirror plane. So, perhaps that's C3h.

Alternatively, the way the substituents are attached might not allow a mirror plane. Hmm.

Alternatively, triphenyleno... might have a C3 axis but not a mirror plane. Or perhaps a mirror plane.

Wait, another approach: which of these molecules is known to have C3h symmetry.

I remember that triphenylene has D3h symmetry because it's a symmetrically fused benzene rings. D3h implies a higher symmetry, including C3, C3h, and other elements.

Wait, triphenylene is a [2.2.2] fused benzene trimer. So, each benzene is connected to the central ring. That would give a three-fold axis. Since each substituent is the same, the molecule has a mirror plane perpendicular to the three-fold axis. So, it has C3h symmetry.

But wait, the options given are the specific compounds. So, option A is triphenyleno...trifuran. So, the molecule would have the triphenylene part, which has D3h symmetry, but when connected to a trifuran, would that affect the symmetry? Hmm, perhaps.

Alternatively, maybe the triphenylene's D3h symmetry is maintained in the larger molecule. If the substituents on the trifuran are arranged symmetrically, then the overall molecule would have C3h symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A, which has C3h symmetry.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused about the specifics. Let me think again about each option.

Option D: Quinuclidine. Its structure is bicyclo[2.2.2]octane. It has a three-fold rotation axis, but I'm not sure about a mirror plane. If it has a mirror plane perpendicular to the C3 axis, then it would have C3h. But I think quinuclidine's symmetry is C3. I think that's correct.

Option C: Triisopropyl borate. It has a trigonal planar arrangement of substituents around boron. So, the molecule has a three-fold rotation axis. Does it also have a horizontal mirror plane? If the molecule is planar, a mirror in the plane (like the xy-plane) would be a horizontal mirror. So, perhaps yes, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the mirror plane is vertical, making it C3v.

Wait, if the substituents are all in the same plane, and the mirror plane is that plane, which is perpendicular to the C3 axis (assuming the C3 is along the vertical), then it's a vertical plane, which would correspond to C3v symmetry. I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps triisopropyl borate has C3v symmetry, not C3h. So, then it wouldn't be the correct answer.

Option B: Benzo…trifuran. I think this structure is less symmetric. The benzo group fuses to one of the furan rings, making the symmetry lower. So, probably not C3h.

So, considering all this, which option remains?

Option A: Triphenyleno...trifuran. The triphenylene part has a three-fold axis and a mirror plane. If the trifuran is attached in a symmetric way, then the whole molecule would have C3h symmetry. Alternatively, maybe the substituents on the trifuran are arranged in a way that breaks the mirror plane. Hmm.

Alternatively, another approach: what's the definition of C3h symmetry. It's the combination of a C3 rotation and a σh (horizontal) mirror. So, the molecule must look the same after a 120-degree rotation and also be symmetric across a horizontal plane.

Looking at the structures, triphenylene is a symmetric molecule, so option A's parent structure is symmetric. The trifuran is attached in a way that doesn't break the symmetry. So, the whole molecule would have C3h symmetry.

Wait, but I'm not 100% sure. Another thought: the triphenylene group is symmetric, but the trifuran part might have substituents that are not symmetrical. For example, if the substituents are on each of the three furan rings, but in a way that's asymmetric.

Alternatively, perhaps the substitution pattern in option A is symmetric. So, each of the three furan rings attached to the triphenylene is in the same position relative to their respective benzene rings. That would maintain the C3h symmetry.

So, putting it all together:

Option A: Triphenyleno…trifuran. Likely has C3h symmetry because the triphenylene part contributes the three-fold and mirror elements, and the trifuran is symmetrically attached.

Option D: Quinuclidine. Has a three-fold axis but no mirror plane, so C3.

Option C: Triisopropyl borate. Maybe C3v, not C3h.

So, the correct answer should be option A.


To determine which molecule has **C₃h symmetry**, we analyze the symmetry elements of each option. **C₃h symmetry** requires a three-fold rotation axis (C₃) and a horizontal mirror plane (σh). The molecule must look identical after a 120° rotation and be symmetric across a plane perpendicular to the C₃ axis.

### Option A: Triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone  
This molecule consists of a triphenylene core (three benzene rings fused symmetrically) attached to a trifuran system. The triphenylene moiety has **D₃h symmetry**, which includes a three-fold axis and a horizontal mirror plane. If the trifuran is symmetrically attached to the triphenylene, the entire molecule retains **C₃h symmetry**. This makes it a strong candidate.

### Option B: Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone  
This molecule has a benzo group fused to a trifuran system. The benzo group introduces asymmetry, as it is not symmetrically equivalent to the other substituents. This breaks the three-fold symmetry, making it unlikely to have **C₃h symmetry**.

### Option C: Triisopropyl borate  
Triisopropyl borate has a central boron atom with three identical isopropyl groups arranged in a trigonal planar geometry. This gives it a **C₃ axis**. However, the molecule does not have a horizontal mirror plane (σh), as the plane perpendicular to the C₃ axis would not bisect the molecule symmetrically. Thus, it has **C₃ symmetry**, not **C₃h symmetry**.

### Option D: Quinuclidine  
Quinuclidine is a bicyclo[2.2.2]octane derivative. It has a three-fold rotation axis (C₃) due to its symmetric bridge structure. However, it does not have a horizontal mirror plane (σh), as the molecule is not symmetric across a plane perpendicular to the C₃ axis. Therefore, it has **C₃ symmetry**, not **C₃h symmetry**.

### Conclusion  
Among the options, **Option A** is the only molecule that retains **C₃h symmetry** due to the symmetric triphenylene core and the symmetric attachment of the trifuran system. 

**Answer: A**
