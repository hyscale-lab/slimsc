Okay, I'm trying to solve this physics problem. Let's see what it's about. The question is about finding the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) so that the speed of a certain nucleus is 0.96c. The nucleus in question is Li with 3 neutrons. 

Wait, Li is lithium. So lithium has an atomic number of 3. If it has 3 neutrons, then the mass number A is protons + neutrons. Protons are 3, so A is 3 +3=6. So the nucleus is Li-6, which is an isotope of lithium.

I remember that the energy of a particle in a collider is related to its kinetic energy and rest mass. Since it's relativistic, I probably need to use the relativistic energy equations.

The speed is given as 0.96c, which is pretty high, so relativistic effects are definitely important here. I think that the total energy E is gamma times the rest energy. Hmm, right, E = gamma * m0 c². But wait, the question is about the energy of the collider, which I believe refers to the kinetic energy or the total energy? I'm a bit confused about that. Let me think. In colliders, usually, they talk about the kinetic energy imparted to the particles. Or sometimes it's the total energy. I think I need to clarify that.

Wait, the problem says "the energy of the RHIC so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c". So I think the question is asking for the total energy each nucleus has when moving at 0.96c. Because RHIC colliders accelerate ions to high speeds and then make them collide. So each ion has a certain energy. So I probably need to calculate the total energy, which includes both kinetic and rest mass energy.

First, I should find the rest mass energy of the Li-6 nucleus. The rest mass is the mass of the nucleus, which I can calculate using the mass of its constituent protons and neutrons. Alternatively, I can use the atomic mass. Let me recall that the molar mass of Li-6 is about 6 grams per mole. Wait, no, the exact calculation is needed.

Wait, the atomic mass of Li-6 is approximately 6 atomic mass units (u). 1 u is about 1.66053906660e-27 kg. But wait, wait, perhaps it's better to use the mass in terms of energy via E=mc². Alternatively, perhaps I can use the rest energy in GeV directly.

Wait, the rest mass energy of a proton is about 938 MeV, right? And a neutron is about 939 MeV. So for Li-6, which is 3 protons and 3 neutrons. So the total rest mass energy would be 3*(938) +3*(939) MeV. Let me compute that.

3 * 938 = 2814, and 3 *939= 2817. So total is 2814+2817=5631 MeV. Which is 5.631 GeV.

Wait, but wait. Is the rest mass of the nucleus exactly the sum of the rest masses of its nucleons? Because when you form a nucleus, there's a binding energy, which is the mass defect. Oh, right, the rest mass of the nucleus is actually less than the sum of the individual nucleons because some mass is converted into binding energy. But wait, in this problem, are we supposed to consider that? Because the question is about the kinetic energy for the speed, so perhaps we are to take the rest mass as the mass of the nucleus, which is the sum of the nucleons' masses. Or is there a better way?

Hmm, perhaps I should look up the exact mass of Li-6. Alternatively, maybe the question assumes that the rest mass is the sum of the individual masses. But I'm not entirely sure. Wait, in reality, the mass is less than the sum, but for the purpose of this problem, maybe we can ignore that detail and proceed with the sum. Let me proceed with that for now.

Wait, the mass of Li-6. Let me think. Alternatively, perhaps the rest mass energy is given by the atomic mass. The atomic mass of Li-6 is approximately 6.0151 u. Let me get the exact value. I remember that Li-6 has an atomic mass of about 6.0151 atomic mass units (u). So 6.0151 u.

So, the rest mass energy E0 is m c². Let me compute that. 1 u is approximately 931.5 MeV/c². So 6.0151 u * 931.5 MeV/c² = ?

6 * 931.5 is 5589 MeV, and 0.0151 *931.5 is about 14.03 MeV. So total E0 is about 5603 MeV, which is 5.603 GeV.

Wait, but that's an approximate. Let me compute it more accurately. 6.0151 *931.5 = 

6 *931.5 =5589.00

0.0151 *931.5 = let's compute: 0.01 *931.5=9.315, 0.005*931.5=4.6575, 0.0001*931.5=0.09315. So 9.315 +4.6575=13.9725 +0.09315=14.06565. 

So total is 5589 +14.06565 = 5603.06565 MeV, which is approximately 5.60306565 GeV.

So E0 is about 5.60307 GeV.

Now, the speed is 0.96c. So gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1/sqrt(1 -v²/c²).

v=0.96c, so v²/c²= (0.96)^2 =0.9216.

1 -0.9216=0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784)=0.28, because 0.28^2 is 0.0784.

So gamma=1/0.28≈3.5714.

Wait, wait, let me compute that more accurately.

v=0.96c, so beta =v/c=0.96.

gamma=1/sqrt(1-beta²) =1/sqrt(1-0.96^2) =1/sqrt(1-0.9216) =1/sqrt(0.0784).

Compute sqrt(0.0784): 0.28. Because 0.28 *0.28=0.0784. So gamma is 1/0.28= approximately 3.57142857.

So gamma ≈3.5714.

So the total energy E is gamma * E0.

E =3.5714 *5.60307 GeV.

Let me compute that:

3.5714 *5 =17.857, 3.5714 *0.60307= ?

Compute 3.5714 *0.6=2.14284, and 3.5714 *0.00307≈0.01094.

So 2.14284 +0.01094≈2.1538.

So total E≈17.857 +2.1538≈19.0108 GeV.

Wait, but wait. Let me compute it more accurately.

3.5714 *5.60307 GeV:

Break it down:

3.5714 *5 =17.857.

3.5714 *0.6 =2.14284.

3.5714 *0.00307 = approx 0.01094.

Adding all together:17.857 +2.14284=19.99984 +0.01094≈20.01078 GeV.

Wait, that's about 20.01 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is close. Option D is 21.419 GeV, which is higher. Hmm, but wait, perhaps my approximations are causing this discrepancy.

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma more precisely. Let me re-calculate gamma.

Compute gamma when beta is 0.96.

Beta squared is 0.96^2=0.9216.

1 - beta squared is 0.0784.

What's sqrt(0.0784)? It's 0.28 exactly, because 28^2=784. So yes, sqrt(0.0784)=0.28, so gamma is exactly 10/2.8? Wait, 1/0.28= 3.57142857...

Wait, so gamma is 3.57142857... So 3.57142857.

So E is gamma * E0, which is 3.57142857 *5.60307 GeV.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

Let me compute 5.60307 *3.57142857.

Let me write 5.60307 as 5 +0.60307.

3.57142857 *5 =17.85714285.

3.57142857 *0.60307:

Compute 3.57142857 *0.6 =2.14285714.

3.57142857 *0.00307 ≈ let's compute 3.57142857 *0.003 =0.0107142857, and 3.57142857 *0.00007=0.00025 approx.

Wait, 0.00307 is 0.003 +0.00007.

So 3.57142857 *0.003 =0.0107142857.

3.57142857 *0.00007=0.0002499999999≈0.00025.

So 0.0107142857+0.00025=0.0109642857.

So total 3.57142857 *0.60307=2.14285714 +0.0109642857=2.153821426.

So adding to 17.85714285:

17.85714285 +2.153821426 =19.01096428 GeV.

Wait, that's about 19.010964 GeV. But earlier I thought I had 20 GeV, but now it's about 19 GeV.

Wait, that can't be right. Did I make a mistake? Because when I did the previous step, I think I multiplied 5.60307*3.5714, which is about 20 GeV. But wait, let's recompute.

Wait, 3.57142857 multiplied by 5.60307.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about 5.60307 *3.57142857.

Let me compute this step by step.

Let me compute 5 *3.57142857 =17.85714285.

0.6 *3.57142857 =2.142857142.

0.00307 *3.57142857 = approximately 0.010964285.

So adding all together: 17.85714285 +2.142857142=20.000000 (because 17.85714285 + 2.142857142 = 20), plus 0.010964285.

So total E=20.010964285 GeV.

Wait, so that's approximately 20.01096 GeV, which is about 20.011 GeV.

Looking at the options:

Option C is 20.132 GeV.

Option D is 21.419 GeV.

Hmm, but our calculation gives about 20.01 GeV. None of the options are exactly that. Oh wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the rest mass calculation.

Wait, maybe the rest mass of Li-6 is not 5.603 GeV. Let me check that again.

Wait, the exact mass of Li-6 is approximately 6.0151 atomic mass units (u). The conversion factor is 1 u = 931.494064 MeV/c².

So 6.0151 u *931.494064 MeV/c² = ?

Let me compute that:

6 *931.494064 =5588.964384 MeV.

0.0151 u *931.494064 = ?

0.0151 *931.494064 = Let's compute:

0.01 *931.494064 =9.31494064.

0.005 *931.494064=4.65747032.

0.0001 *931.494064=0.0931494064.

Adding these together: 9.31494064 +4.65747032 =13.97241096 +0.0931494064=14.06556037 MeV.

So total E0 is 5588.964384 +14.06556037=5603.029945 MeV, which is 5.603029945 GeV.

So E0 is approximately 5.60303 GeV.

So gamma is 3.57142857.

So E=gamma * E0 =3.57142857 *5.60303 GeV.

Compute 3.57142857 *5.60303.

Again, breaking it down:

3 *5.60303 =16.80909.

0.57142857 *5.60303 ≈ ?

0.5 *5.60303 =2.801515.

0.07142857 *5.60303 ≈ Let's compute 0.07 *5.60303=0.3922121, and 0.00142857 *5.60303≈0.007998.

So 0.3922121 +0.007998=0.40021.

So total for 0.57142857 *5.60303 is 2.801515 +0.40021=3.201725.

Adding to 16.80909: 16.80909 +3.201725=20.010815 GeV.

So E≈20.0108 GeV.

Looking at the options, the closest is option C:20.132 GeV. Wait, but that's 20.132, which is higher than our calculated 20.01 GeV.

Hmm, could I have made a mistake in computing gamma?

Wait, let me recheck gamma.

v=0.96c.

Gamma=1/sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2 ) =1/sqrt(1-0.9216)=1/sqrt(0.0784)=1/0.28=3.57142857.

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated E0.

Wait, perhaps I should use the exact value of the atomic mass of Li-6.

Let me check the exact value. The exact atomic mass of Li-6 is 6.01512223041 u (from NIST or other sources). Let me get precise.

So 6.01512223041 u.

Multiply by 931.494064 MeV/c² per u.

6 *931.494064 =5588.964384 MeV.

0.01512223041 u *931.494064 MeV/u =?

Let me compute 0.01512223041 *931.494064.

0.01 *931.494064=9.31494064.

0.005 *931.494064=4.65747032.

0.00012223041 *931.494064 ≈ approximately 0.00012223041 *900=0.110007369.

And 0.00012223041 *31.494064≈approx 0.003852.

So sum: 9.31494064 +4.65747032=13.97241096.

13.97241096 +0.110007369=14.08241833.

Plus 0.003852=14.08627033 MeV.

So E0=5588.964384 +14.08627033=5603.050654 MeV=5.603050654 GeV.

So E0 is approximately 5.60305 GeV.

Gamma is 3.57142857.

So E=3.57142857 *5.60305 GeV.

Compute 3.57142857 *5.60305.

Let me compute this accurately.

3.57142857 *5 =17.85714285.

3.57142857 *0.60305.

Compute 3.57142857 *0.6=2.142857142.

3.57142857 *0.00305= let me compute 0.003 *3.57142857=0.0107142857, and 0.00005 *3.57142857=0.0001785714285.

So 0.0107142857 +0.0001785714285=0.0108928571.

So 3.57142857 *0.60305=2.142857142 +0.0108928571≈2.15375.

Adding to 17.85714285 +2.15375=20.01089285 GeV.

So E= approximately 20.0109 GeV.

The options are:

A) 18.475 GeV

B) 23.069 GeV

C) 20.132 GeV

D) 21.419 GeV.

Hmm, our calculated value is approximately 20.0109 GeV, but the closest option is C)20.132 GeV.

Wait, that's a difference of about 0.12 GeV. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma with more precision. Let's see.

Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2).

(0.96)^2 =0.9216.

1 -0.9216=0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784) is exactly 0.28, because 0.28^2=0.0784.

So gamma is exactly 1/0.28=3.571428571428571.

So no error there.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the rest mass is the mass of the nucleus, which is Li-6, and not the sum of the individual protons and neutrons. So perhaps I should use the exact mass of Li-6.

Let me double-check the exact mass of Li-6.

Li-6 has an atomic mass of approximately 6.01512223 u.

So 6.01512223 u * 931.494064 MeV/u = ?

Let me compute it more accurately.

6.01512223 * 931.494064 = ?

Compute 6 *931.494064=5588.964384 MeV.

0.01512223 *931.494064=?

0.01 *931.494064=9.31494064.

0.005 *931.494064=4.65747032.

0.00012223 *931.494064= approx 0.11334.

Wait, 0.0001 *931.494064=0.0931494064.

0.00002223 *931.494064= approx 0.020729.

So total for 0.00012223 is 0.0931494064 +0.020729=0.113878.

So 9.31494064 +4.65747032=13.97241096 +0.113878=14.08628896 MeV.

So total E0=5588.964384 +14.08628896=5603.050673 MeV=5.603050673 GeV.

So E0 is 5.603050673 GeV.

Now, compute E=3.57142857 *5.603050673.

Let me compute this as:

3.57142857 *5.603050673.

I can use a calculator approach.

Compute 3.57142857 *5 =17.85714285.

3.57142857 *0.603050673.

Compute 3.57142857 *0.6 =2.142857142.

3.57142857 *0.003050673.

Compute 0.003 *3.57142857=0.0107142857.

0.000050673 *3.57142857≈0.0001804.

So 0.0107142857 +0.0001804=0.0108946857.

So 3.57142857 *0.603050673=2.142857142 +0.0108946857=2.153751827.

Now, add 17.85714285 +2.153751827=20.01089468 GeV.

So E≈20.01089 GeV.

Hmm, still around 20.01 GeV. So perhaps the intended answer is option C)20.132 GeV, but my calculation doesn't reach that. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the rest mass.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the question is asking for the kinetic energy, not the total energy. Because sometimes in these problems, people confuse total energy and kinetic energy.

Wait, the question says: "What is the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c?"

RHIC's energy is typically the kinetic energy of the ions. Because when you say the energy of the collider, it's the kinetic energy that's imparted to the particles. So perhaps I should compute the kinetic energy, not the total energy.

So the kinetic energy K is E - E0 = (gamma -1) E0.

So let's compute that.

K= (3.57142857 -1) *5.603050673 GeV.

Gamma=3.57142857, so gamma-1=2.57142857.

2.57142857 *5.603050673.

Compute 2*5.603050673=11.20610135.

0.57142857 *5.603050673.

0.5 *5.603050673=2.8015253365.

0.07142857 *5.603050673 ≈ Let's compute.

0.07 *5.603050673=0.392213547.

0.00142857 *5.603050673≈0.007997.

So 0.392213547 +0.007997≈0.400210547.

So 0.57142857 *5.603050673=2.8015253365 +0.400210547≈3.201735884.

So K=11.20610135 +3.201735884≈14.40783723 GeV.

Wait, that's about 14.408 GeV. But the options don't have anything near that. So that can't be right.

Wait, but earlier when I thought the question was about the total energy, the calculation was around 20 GeV, which is option C being 20.132 GeV.

But I'm not reaching that number.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the rest mass of the nucleus. Let me check again.

Wait, the exact mass of Li-6 is 6.01512223 u.

So 6.01512223 *931.494064 MeV/u = ?

6 *931.494064 =5588.964384 MeV.

0.01512223 *931.494064= let's compute accurately.

0.01 *931.494064=9.31494064.

0.005 *931.494064=4.65747032.

0.00012223 *931.494064= let's compute 0.0001 *931.494064=0.0931494064.

0.00002223 *931.494064= approx 0.0207289.

So total for 0.00012223 is 0.0931494064 +0.0207289=0.1138783.

Adding to the previous parts:9.31494064 +4.65747032=13.97241096 +0.1138783=14.08628926 MeV.

So E0=5588.964384 +14.08628926=5603.050673 MeV=5.603050673 GeV.

So that's correct.

So E_total=gamma * E0=3.57142857 *5.603050673=20.01089468 GeV.

So approximately 20.0109 GeV.

Looking at the options, none match exactly. The closest is option C:20.132 GeV. But perhaps the question expects more precise calculation, considering more decimal places.

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma more accurately. Let me compute gamma again.

v=0.96c.

gamma=1/sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2 )=1/sqrt(1 -0.9216)=1/sqrt(0.0784)=1/0.28=3.571428571428571.

So no error there.

Alternative approach: perhaps the question uses a different value for the speed of light or other constants. Maybe the rest mass is taken as 6 nucleons each at 938 MeV/c².

Wait, let's try that approach. If X is Li with 3 neutrons (so Li-6), then number of nucleons is 6 (3 protons and 3 neutrons). Each proton is about 938 MeV/c², each neutron about 939 MeV/c².

So the rest mass would be 3*(938) +3*(939) =3*(1877)=5631 MeV=5.631 GeV.

So E0=5.631 GeV.

Then, E=gamma * E0=3.5714 *5.631.

Compute 3.5714 *5 =17.857.

3.5714 *0.631= let me compute:

0.6 *3.5714=2.14284.

0.031 *3.5714≈0.11071.

So 2.14284 +0.11071=2.25355.

So total E=17.857 +2.25355=20.11055 GeV.

So approximately 20.11 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is very close.

Ah, so perhaps the question assumes that the rest mass is calculated as the sum of the individual nucleons, which gives E0=5.631 GeV, leading to E≈20.11 GeV, which rounds to 20.132 GeV when considering more precise calculations.

Wait, wait, perhaps I should compute it more precisely.

E=3.57142857 *5.631 GeV.

3.57142857 *5=17.85714285.

3.57142857 *0.631= let's compute:

0.6 *3.57142857=2.142857142.

0.03 *3.57142857=0.1071428571.

0.001 *3.57142857=0.00357142857.

So 2.142857142 +0.1071428571=2.25, plus 0.00357142857=2.2535714285.

Adding to 17.85714285:17.85714285 +2.2535714285=20.11071428 GeV.

So 20.1107 GeV.

Now, option C is 20.132 GeV. Hmm, that's a bit higher.

Wait, perhaps I should carry out the multiplication more accurately.

5.631 *3.57142857.

Let me compute this accurately.

5.631 *3.57142857.

Break down:

5 *3.57142857 =17.85714285.

0.6 *3.57142857=2.142857142.

0.03 *3.57142857=0.1071428571.

0.001 *3.57142857=0.00357142857.

Adding these:17.85714285 +2.142857142=20.000000 (exactly), plus 0.1071428571=20.1071428571, plus 0.00357142857=20.1107142857 GeV.

So E=20.1107142857 GeV.

Hmm, but the option C is 20.132 GeV, which is about 20.132. So there's a discrepancy.

Wait, perhaps I used the wrong approach earlier. Another possibility is that the problem uses the mass of the lithium nucleus as approximately 6 GeV/c², which would be 6 *938 MeV=5628 MeV=5.628 GeV.

Wait, let me try with E0=5.628 GeV.

E=3.57142857 *5.628.

Compute 3.57142857 *5=17.85714285.

3.57142857 *0.628=?

0.6 *3.57142857=2.142857142.

0.02 *3.57142857=0.0714285714.

0.008 *3.57142857=0.02857142856.

So 2.142857142 +0.0714285714=2.2142857134 +0.02857142856=2.24285714196.

Adding to 17.85714285:17.85714285 +2.24285714196=20.10 GeV.

So 20.10 GeV.

Still, that's 20.10, which is closer to option C (20.132) but not exactly matching.

Wait, perhaps the initial assumption about the rest mass is wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects using a different value of c, like c=3e8 m/s, but that shouldn't affect the energy in GeV calculations.

Another thought: Perhaps the question is referring to the kinetic energy, but earlier when I computed K, I got around 14.4 GeV, which doesn't match any options. So that can't be it.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that the question expects the total energy, and the correct calculation leads to approximately 20.01 GeV, but the closest option is C)20.132 GeV. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should recompute with more precise gamma.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I should compute gamma using more precise beta.

Beta is 0.96.

Compute gamma=1/sqrt(1 -0.96²)=1/sqrt(0.0784)=1/0.28=3.57142857.

Wait, perhaps using more precise calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute gamma as (1 - (0.96)^2 )^-0.5.

But that's the same as before. So I'm confident in gamma.

Hmm, perhaps I should calculate E0 more precisely.

Wait, perhaps the exact calculation is needed. Let me see.

Li-6 has an atomic mass of 6.01512223 u.

1 u = 931.494064 MeV/c².

So E0 =6.01512223 *931.494064 MeV.

Compute this:

6 *931.494064=5588.964384 MeV.

0.01512223 *931.494064.

Compute 0.01 *931.494064=9.31494064.

0.005 *931.494064=4.65747032.

0.00012223 *931.494064:

Compute 0.0001 *931.494064=0.0931494064.

0.00002223 *931.494064=0.0207289.

So sum:9.31494064 +4.65747032=13.97241096 +0.0931494064=14.06556037 +0.0207289=14.08628927 MeV.

So E0=5588.964384 +14.08628927=5603.050673 MeV=5.603050673 GeV.

So E=3.57142857 *5.603050673 =20.01089468 GeV.

Rounded to four decimal places, that's 20.0109 GeV.

Looking at the options, the closest is C)20.132 GeV, but that's about 0.12 GeV higher than our calculation. So perhaps the intended answer is C, but I'm not entirely sure why there's a discrepancy.

Another thought: perhaps I made a mistake in considering the nucleus's charge or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the question has a typo, but that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the kinetic energy. Let me try that.

K= (gamma-1)*E0.

gamma=3.57142857, so gamma-1=2.57142857.

E0=5.603050673 GeV.

So K=2.57142857 *5.603050673.

Compute:

2 *5.603050673=11.20610135.

0.57142857 *5.603050673.

0.5 *5.603050673=2.8015253365.

0.07142857 *5.603050673=0.400210547.

So sum:2.8015253365 +0.400210547=3.2017358835.

So K=11.20610135 +3.2017358835=14.40783723 GeV.

But the options don't have this value. So perhaps the question is indeed about the total energy, leading to approximately 20.01 GeV, but the closest option is C)20.132 GeV.

Wait, perhaps my calculation of gamma is wrong. Let me compute gamma using more precise beta.

Beta=0.96.

Compute gamma=1/(sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2)).

(0.96)^2=0.9216.

1-0.9216=0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784)=0.28.

So gamma=1/0.28=3.57142857.

So that's correct.

Hmm, perhaps the problem expects the total energy to be approximately 20.01 GeV, but the options don't have that. So perhaps the intended answer is option C)20.132 GeV.

But why the discrepancy? Let me check if I used the correct value for gamma.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the speed is 0.96c, but the relativistic energy is given by E² = (pc)² + (m c²)².

Alternatively, since we know the speed, we can compute p (momentum) and then find E.

But that might complicate things. Let me think.

Wait, we can compute the momentum p as gamma * m v.

But perhaps it's easier to compute using E = gamma m c².

Which is what I did earlier.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses a different calculation for gamma. Let me recompute gamma using a calculator.

Compute gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2).

(0.96)^2=0.9216.

1-0.9216=0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784)=0.28.

gamma=1/0.28=3.57142857.

So that's correct.

Hmm, perhaps the intended answer is option C, but I'm not sure. Based on the calculations, the correct energy is approximately 20.01 GeV, which is closest to option C, but the options don't have that. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the rest mass calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should check the exact value of the atomic mass of Li-6.

Looking up, the exact mass of Li-6 is 6.01512223 u.

So E0=6.01512223 u *931.494064 MeV/u =5603.050673 MeV=5.603050673 GeV.

So E=gamma * E0=3.57142857 *5.603050673=20.01089468 GeV.

So approximately 20.01 GeV.

But the options are:

A)18.475

B)23.069

C)20.132

D)21.419

The closest is option C)20.132, but it's higher.

Wait, perhaps I should compute E with more precise gamma.

Wait, perhaps the calculation should be done with more precise numbers.

Let me try with more decimal places.

gamma = 3.571428571428571.

E0=5.603050673 GeV.

Compute E=3.571428571428571 *5.603050673.

Compute using more precise multiplication.

3.571428571428571 *5.603050673.

I can compute this as:

(3 + 0.571428571428571) * (5 + 0.603050673).

Which is:

3*5=15.

3*0.603050673=1.809152019.

0.571428571428571 *5=2.857142857142855.

0.571428571428571 *0.603050673=0.3446342966.

Adding all together:

15 +1.809152019=16.809152019.

16.809152019 +2.857142857142855=19.666294876.

19.666294876 +0.3446342966=20.01092917 GeV.

So E≈20.010929 GeV.

Rounded to four decimal places, 20.0109 GeV.

So the precise calculation leads to 20.0109 GeV.

Looking at the options again, the only option in the vicinity is C)20.132 GeV.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck. Perhaps I made a mistake in the rest mass calculation.

Wait, perhaps the rest mass of the nucleus should be calculated using the exact binding energy. But that would complicate things, and I don't think that's intended for this problem.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the rest mass in a different way. Alternatively, perhaps the speed is 0.96c, but the gamma calculation is done differently. Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma using more precise beta.

Another approach: compute gamma using more precise beta.

Beta=0.96.

Compute gamma = 1/sqrt(1 -0.96^2).

0.96^2=0.9216.

1-0.9216=0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784)=0.28.

So gamma=3.57142857.

No mistake there.

Wait, perhaps the question expects using a different calculation for gamma, like using a Taylor expansion or another method, but that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the center-of-mass energy, but that's more complicated and I don't think that's the case.

Another thought: Perhaps I should use the exact value of gamma as 3.571428571428571, and multiply it by E0=5.603050673 GeV.

So, 3.571428571428571 *5.603050673.

Let me compute this using a calculator approach.

5.603050673 *3.571428571428571.

Using a calculator:

5.603050673 × 3.571428571428571 ≈ 20.01089468 GeV.

So again, we're back to 20.0109 GeV.

Thus, the correct answer should be approximately 20.01 GeV. However, the options don't have this exact value. The closest option is C)20.132 GeV. But perhaps the intended answer is option C.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial step, and the correct approach is to use the kinetic energy. But earlier calculations of K led to around 14.4 GeV, which doesn't match any options.

Wait, perhaps the question is using the rest mass as the sum of the individual protons and neutrons without considering binding energy. Let me try that.

Protons: 3 *938 MeV=2814 MeV.

Neutrons:3 *939 MeV=2817 MeV.

Total E0=2814 +2817=5631 MeV=5.631 GeV.

Gamma=3.57142857.

E=3.57142857 *5.631=20.1107 GeV.

So 20.1107 GeV, which is approximately 20.11 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV. So perhaps the intended answer is option C, considering that the rest mass is taken as 5.631 GeV.

In that case, the correct option would be C)20.132 GeV.


To determine the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) so that the speed of the Li-6 nucleus is 0.96c, we calculate the total energy of the nucleus using the relativistic energy formula:

\[
E = \gamma \cdot E_0
\]

where \( \gamma \) is the Lorentz factor and \( E_0 \) is the rest energy of the nucleus.

### Step 1: Rest Energy of Li-6
The atomic mass of Li-6 is approximately \( 6.01512223 \, \text{u} \), where \( 1 \, \text{u} = 931.494064 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \). The rest energy is:

\[
E_0 = 6.01512223 \cdot 931.494064 \, \text{MeV} = 5603.050673 \, \text{MeV} = 5.603050673 \, \text{GeV}.
\]

### Step 2: Lorentz Factor (\( \gamma \))
The speed of the nucleus is \( v = 0.96c \), so \( \beta = v/c = 0.96 \). The Lorentz factor is:

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \beta^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.96)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.9216}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.0784}} = \frac{1}{0.28} \approx 3.57142857.
\]

### Step 3: Total Energy
The total energy is:

\[
E = \gamma \cdot E_0 = 3.57142857 \cdot 5.603050673 \, \text{GeV}.
\]

Breaking this calculation into parts:
- \( 3.57142857 \cdot 5 = 17.85714285 \, \text{GeV} \),
- \( 3.57142857 \cdot 0.603050673 \approx 2.153751827 \, \text{GeV} \).

Adding these together:

\[
E = 17.85714285 + 2.153751827 \approx 20.01089468 \, \text{GeV}.
\]

### Step 4: Comparing with Options
The calculated total energy is approximately \( 20.01 \, \text{GeV} \). Among the given options:
- **A) 18.475 GeV**: Too low.
- **B) 23.069 GeV**: Too high.
- **C) 20.132 GeV**: Closest to the calculated value.
- **D) 21.419 GeV**: Too high.

### Step 5: Considering Rest Mass Approximation
If the rest mass is approximated as the sum of the individual nucleons (protons and neutrons) without accounting for binding energy, the rest energy becomes:

\[
E_0 = 3 \cdot 938 \, \text{MeV} + 3 \cdot 939 \, \text{MeV} = 5631 \, \text{MeV} = 5.631 \, \text{GeV}.
\]

Using this \( E_0 \), the total energy is:

\[
E = 3.57142857 \cdot 5.631 \approx 20.11 \, \text{GeV}.
\]

This value is closer to option **C) 20.132 GeV**, suggesting that the problem may assume this approximation.

### Conclusion
The most reasonable answer, based on the calculations and the given options, is:

**Answer: C**
