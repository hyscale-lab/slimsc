Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, let me think through this. I'm a bit rusty on EDTA complexes, but I'll try to work it out step by step.

The question says: What is the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing 0.02 M stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex? The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. The stability constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5×10^10. The options are A to D.

Wait, I remember that EDTA forms complexes with metal ions. The formula for the complex is usually something like CaY²−, where Y is the EDTA. So the stoichiometric ratio is 1:1 between Ca²+ and EDTA.

The given concentration is 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. So the initial concentration [CaY²−] is 0.02 M.

But we're asked about the free calcium ions [Ca²+] in solution. Since EDTA is a strong chelating agent, it should form a very stable complex with Ca²+, right? So the free Ca²+ concentration should be really low.

The stability constant, K, is given as 5×10^10. I think the stability constant equation is K = [CaY²−]/([Ca²+][EDTA]). But wait, in this case, the solution is 0.02 M CaY²−, so I need to find [Ca²+].

Wait, but wait. What about the EDTA concentration? Since the complex is 0.02 M, that's the concentration of CaY²−. But how much free EDTA is there? Well, in a solution with excess EDTA, the concentration of the complex is high, but if the EDTA is limiting, then maybe more EDTA is tied up in the complex. Hmm, but the problem says "stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex"—so maybe the moles of Ca²+ and EDTA are in a 1:1 ratio. So for each mole of Ca²+ that reacts, one mole of EDTA is consumed.

Wait, but the problem says the solution contains 0.02 M of the complex. So all the Ca²+ is tied up as CaY²−, but wait, that's not correct because some might dissociate. But given the high stability constant, the dissociation should be minimal.

So, the dissociation of the complex would be CaY²− ↔ Ca²+ + Y^4−. The K for this reaction would be 1/Kstab, because Kstab is the formation constant, Kf = [CaY²−]/([Ca²+][Y^4−]). So the dissociation constant Kd would be 1/Kf = 2e-11 (since Kf is 5e10). 

So if I have [CaY²−] = 0.02 M, then the dissociation reaction is:

CaY²− ↔ Ca²+ + Y^4−

But wait, I'm not given [Y^4−], but assuming that the solution is buffered or pH is such that Y^4− is predominant. Or, perhaps the problem simplifies by assuming that the EDTA is present in excess, so [Y] is approximately equal to the initial EDTA concentration, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but wait—since the complex is 0.02 M, and the problem says it's stoichiometric, perhaps the initial concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA were both 0.02 M. But that might not be necessary. Alternatively, perhaps the solution is such that the only species present is CaY²−, and the concentration of free ions is minimal.

Wait, but another approach. Let me think. The formation constant Kf is given by Kf = [CaY²−]/([Ca²+][EDTA]). So rearranging, [Ca²+] = [CaY²−]/(Kf * [EDTA]).

But wait, in this case, how much EDTA is present? Because the complex is formed, so the [EDTA] is the free EDTA plus the EDTA in the complex. Hmm, no, wait: the total EDTA concentration would be [EDTA]total = [EDTA] + [CaY²−]. But if the solution is 0.02 M in CaY²− and assuming that the EDTA is in large excess, [EDTA] might be approximately equal to [EDTA]total. But wait, that might not hold if the Kf is so high.

Wait, but if Kf is very large (5e10), that means the complex is very stable, so the dissociation is minimal. So [Ca²+] would be very low.

So, let's think in terms of the dissociation. Let x be the concentration of free Ca²+.

So, Kd = [Ca²+][EDTA] / [CaY²−] = 1/Kf = 1/(5e10) = 2e-11.

We have [CaY²−] = 0.02 M.

Assuming that [EDTA] is approximately equal to the initial concentration of EDTA, but wait, the initial EDTA isn't given. Hmm, this complicates things.

Wait, no. Let's think differently. Let me model the system.

Assume that the solution is made by adding 0.02 M CaY²−. So initially, [CaY²−] = 0.02 M. Then, some of it dissociates into Ca²+ and Y^4−.

Let the dissociation be x. So at equilibrium:

[CaY²−] = 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02 (since x is very small because Kd is tiny)

[Ca²+] = x

[EDTA (Y^4−)] = x (since each mole of CaY²− that dissociates gives one mole of Y^4−)

Wait, but wait—EDTA can also come from other sources. But in this case, the problem states that the solution contains 0.02 M CaY²−, so perhaps the only source of Y is this complex's dissociation. So the total EDTA concentration would be [Y^4−] = x.

Wait, but that can't be right. Because if all the EDTA was in the complex, then [EDTA] would be x, but if the solution was made by dissolving the complex, then the initial EDTA is zero, and the only EDTA comes from the dissociation. Wait, that makes sense. So when the CaY²− dissociates, it releases Y^4−. So in this case, the [EDTA] is x.

So, the Kd is:

Kd = ([Ca²+][EDTA])/[CaY²−] = (x * x)/(0.02) = x² / 0.02 = 2e-11.

So solving for x²:

x² = (2e-11) * 0.02 = 4e-13.

Wait, 0.02 is 2e-2. So 2e-11 * 2e-2 = (2*2) * 1e-13 = 4e-13.

So x² = 4e-13.

Taking square root, x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5.

Wait, 1e-6 is 1e-6, sqrt(4) is 2. So 2e-6.5 is 2 * 1e-6.5.

Wait, 1e-6.5 is 3.16e-7, because 10^0.5 is about 3.16. So 2e-6.5 is 6.32e-7.

So [Ca²+] is approximately 6.3e-7 M. Looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check the calculations.

Kd = 1/(5e10) = 2e-11.

x² = Kd * [CaY²−] = (2e-11) * 0.02 = 4e-13.

x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5.

Wait, 1e-6.5 is about 3.16e-7. So 2 * 3.16e-7 is 6.32e-7 M.

Yes, that's about 6.3e-7, which is option C.


To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex (CaY²⁻), we use the dissociation equilibrium of the complex:

\[
\text{CaY}^{2-} \leftrightarrow \text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{Y}^{4-}
\]

The dissociation constant \( K_d \) is related to the stability constant \( K_f \) by:

\[
K_d = \frac{1}{K_f}
\]

Given \( K_f = 5 \times 10^{10} \), we calculate:

\[
K_d = \frac{1}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 2 \times 10^{-11}
\]

Let \( x \) represent the concentration of free \( \text{Ca}^{2+} \) ions at equilibrium. The equilibrium concentrations are:

- \([ \text{CaY}^{2-} ] = 0.02 - x \approx 0.02 \) (since \( x \) is very small),
- \([ \text{Ca}^{2+} ] = x \),
- \([ \text{Y}^{4-} ] = x \) (assuming all EDTA comes from dissociation of the complex).

The equilibrium expression for \( K_d \) is:

\[
K_d = \frac{[ \text{Ca}^{2+} ][ \text{Y}^{4-} ]}{[ \text{CaY}^{2-} ]}
\]

Substituting the known values:

\[
2 \times 10^{-11} = \frac{x^2}{0.02}
\]

Rearranging for \( x^2 \):

\[
x^2 = (2 \times 10^{-11}) \times 0.02 = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5}
\]

Since \( 10^{-6.5} \approx 3.16 \times 10^{-7} \), we find:

\[
x = 2 \times 3.16 \times 10^{-7} = 6.32 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, the concentration of free \( \text{Ca}^{2+} \) ions is approximately \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \), which corresponds to option C.

Answer: C
