Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Hmm, I need to identify a compound based on its spectroscopic data. The molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Let me break down the information given.

First, the IR data. It shows medium to strong bands at 3420 and 3325 cm-1. Those are probably N-H stretches because those regions are typically where amines or amides absorb. Wait, but the options include aminobenzoate and formamide, which are different. Also, there's a strong band at 1720 cm-1. That's a carbonyl group, like an ester or amide. So, the compound likely has both an N-containing group and a carbonyl.

Looking at the 1H NMR data now. Let's list them out:

- 1.20 ppm (t, 3H): This is a triplet, likely from a CH2CH3 group, so an ethyl group attached to something. The triplet means it's next to a CH2.
- 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H): Broad singlet, 2H. Maybe an N-attached CH2, like in an ethyl ester or an amide. Or perhaps an -OCH2- group?
- 4.5 ppm (q, 2H): Quartet, 2H. The quartet suggests two neighboring groups, maybe a CH2 adjacent to another CH2. Like in an ethyl group where the neighboring CH2 is split into a quartet.
- 7.0 ppm (d, 2H): Doublet, two protons. This looks like two aromatic protons, possibly para-substituted.
- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H): Another doublet, two protons. Also aromatic, maybe adjacent to the substituent.

Wait, the aromatic signals are two doublets, each integrating for 2H. That's typical of a para-substituted benzene ring. So, the substituent is probably in the para position of the benzene.

Looking at the options:

Option A) 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure: benzamide with an ethoxy group on carbon 3. So, ortho to the amide. Benzamide would have a carbonyl, and ethoxy is an ether. IR: amide N-H would show broad bands. The IR data has two strong N-H bands, maybe because it's an amide. The 1720 cm-1 could be the amide carbonyl.

Option B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. So, a formamide group attached to the benzene ring which has an ethoxy at para. The formamide has a carbonyl and an N-H. The NMR would show the ethoxy as triplet at around 1.2, and the OCH2CH3. The 4.0 ppm might be the N-CH2 from the formamide, but I'm not sure.

Option C) 4-aminophenyl propionate. That's a propionate ester where the amine is on the benzene. Wait, 4-aminophenyl propionate would be like CH2CH2COO-NH-(benzene). But wait, the formula for that would be C9H11NO3? Because phenyl is C6H5, propionate is C3H5O2, and amine is NH. Wait, let me check: the molecular formula given is C9H11NO2. So, option C is C9H11NO3? Because phenyl (C6H5-) plus propionate (C3H5O2-) would make C9H10O2, but with an NH group, maybe adding another H? Hmm, perhaps I'm getting that wrong. Alternatively, maybe it's a different structure.

Option D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. That would be benzoate (from benzoic acid) esterified with ethyl, and an amino group in the para position. So structure is OEt-CO-NH-C6H4- (para). That would have a carbonyl (ester), an ethyl group, and an amine.

Let me think about the NMR for each option.

Starting with option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. The benzoate ester would have a carbonyl, which explains the 1720 IR. The ester group is O-CO-OEt. Wait, no, wait: in an ester, the carbonyl is around 1720, so that fits. The ethyl group is OEt.

In the NMR:

- The ethyl from the ester would be split as triplet at around
