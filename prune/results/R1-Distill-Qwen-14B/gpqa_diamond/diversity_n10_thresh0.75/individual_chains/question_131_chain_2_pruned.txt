Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a shot.

The question is about the dehydration of a dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene to form an anhydride. Then, this anhydride reacts with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene to yield two products—a major and minor. Both have the formula C13H16O3. The 2D NOESY NMR of the major shows a cross-peak, but the minor doesn't. I need to figure out which two resonances are connected in the major product's NMR.

First, let me break down the problem. Starting with the dicarboxylic acid. It has a cis-alkene, so when it dehydrates, it forms an anhydride. The anhydride has a specific NMR: in 1H, a single peak at 7 ppm, and in 13C, peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm.

Wait, 7 ppm in 1H NMR—what does that correspond to? Aromatic protons? Or maybe an olefinic proton? But wait, anhydrides... Let me think. Anhydrides typically have carbonyl groups, but their protons would be on oxygenated carbons. Oh, maybe the 7 ppm peak is from an aromatic ring. Because 7 ppm is where aromatic protons usually show up.

But wait, the starting material is a cis-alkene. When dehydrated, it would form an anhydride. If the alkene was between two carboxylic acid groups, the dehydration would form a cyclic anhydride. So, maybe the structure is something like a bicyclic anhydride, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe it's a succinic anhydride type structure. Wait, but the NMR data suggests something else. The 13C NMR shows 137 ppm and 165 ppm. 137 is probably a carbon adjacent to an oxygen, maybe an sp2 hybridized carbon, like in an alkene or an aromatic ring. 165 is likely a carbonyl carbon, such as in an anhydride or ester.

Wait, the H NMR has a single peak at 7 ppm. If it's a singlet, that suggests maybe equivalent protons. Aromatic ring with equivalent Hs? Like a para-substituted benzene? No, because that would have more than one peak unless it's a symmetrical structure.

Wait, but the starting material is a dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene. So perhaps the structure is something like HOOC-CH2CH2-COOH, but with the CH2CH2 being cis. No, wait, if that's the case, then the anhydride would form between the two carboxylic acids. So, maybe it's a structure where the two carboxylic acid groups are connected via a cis-alkene. Dehydration would form an anhydride ring.

Wait, but an anhydride formed from succinic acid would have a structure like this: O=C-O-C-O-C=O, but that's a five-membered ring? No, wait, succinic anhydride is a five-membered ring. So, that would be O=C-(CH2)2-O-C=O. Wait, no, succinic anhydride is a cyclic anhydride where the two carboxylic acids lose water and form a ring. So the structure is a five-membered ring with two carbonyls and two methylene groups. But the starting molecule
