Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the energy required to accelerate a nucleus to a certain speed. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

The question states that the speed of nucleus X is 0.96 times the speed of light, c. And I need to find the energy of the RHIC that achieves this. The options are given in GeV, which is giga-electronvolts. 

First, I should figure out what nucleus X is. The problem says X is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium. The standard lithium has an atomic number of 3. The isotopes are usually expressed as Li-7 (3 protons, 4 neutrons), Li-6 (3 protons, 3 neutrons), etc. So Li with 3 neutrons would be Li-6, right? So, X is the Li-6 nucleus.

Now, the energy we're looking for is the total relativistic energy of the nucleus. I remember that in relativity, the total energy E is given by gamma times the rest mass energy, E = gamma * m0c². Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1 over the square root of (1 - v²/c²).

So, I need to calculate gamma first. Given v = 0.96c, let's compute gamma.

Gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²))
v = 0.96c, so v²/c² is (0.96)^2 = 0.9216.

1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784.

So sqrt(0.0784) is... let me calculate. Hmm, 0.28 squared is 0.0784, because 0.28 * 0.28 = 0.0784. So sqrt is 0.28.

So gamma is 1 / 0.28. Let me compute that: 1 divided by 0.28 is approximately 3.5714. Wait, because 0.28 * 3.5714 is 1. Let me check: 0.28 * 3 = 0.84, 0.28 * 3.5714 ≈ 1 exactly. So gamma is about 3.5714.

Now, the rest mass energy of the Li-6 nucleus. The nucleus is made up of protons and neutrons. Each proton has a mass of about 938 MeV/c², and same for each neutron. 

Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. So total rest mass is (3 * 938) + (3 * 938) = 6 * 938 MeV. Let's compute that: 6*938 = 5628 MeV. Oh wait, that's 5.628 GeV because 1 GeV is 1000 MeV.

Wait, wait. Wait, actually, each nucleon (proton or neutron) has a rest mass of approximately 938 MeV/c². So 6 nucleons would be 6 * 938 MeV = 5
