Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particles in a detector. Hmm, let me try to figure it out. Alright, let's read the question again.

So, particles are collided at the center of a spherical detector. These new particles are fast-decaying and travel at ultra-relativistic velocities with a Lorentz factor of about 20. On average, one third of these particles reaches the detector's inner walls. The detector's radius is 30 meters.

The question is asking: what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of the particles reach the inner walls?

Wait, I'm a bit confused. So right now, with a Lorentz factor of 20, only one third make it. We want to increase the fraction to two-thirds. So I guess we need a higher Lorentz factor, because higher speeds would allow more particles to reach the walls before decaying.

Wait, but how does the Lorentz factor relate to the distance they travel? Oh right, Lorentz factor gamma is the factor by which time dilates from the particle's perspective. So the lifetime of the particle as seen in the lab frame is gamma times the proper lifetime.

So the particles have to travel a distance equal to the radius of the detector, right? The detector is a sphere with radius 30 meters. So the maximum distance a particle can travel is 30 meters before hitting the wall.

Wait, but wait. The particles are created at the center, so they have to go 30 meters to reach the wall. So the proper lifetime (tau) multiplied by gamma
