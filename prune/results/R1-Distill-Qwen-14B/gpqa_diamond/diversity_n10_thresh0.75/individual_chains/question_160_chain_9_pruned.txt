Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about an aperture shaped like a regular N-sided polygon. All the apothems are the same length 'a'. Monochromatic light of wavelength λ is falling vertically on this aperture, and it creates intensity maxima and minima in the far field. The question is asking for the angular distance between the first two minima when N is infinitely large. Hmm, so N approaching infinity would make the polygon look like a circle, right? Because as the number of sides increases, the polygon approximates a circle.

Wait, but wait, the apothem is given. The apothem of a regular polygon is the distance from the center to the midpoint of one of its sides. For a polygon with N sides, the apothem 'a' relates to the radius (distance from center to a vertex) as a = R cos(π/N), maybe? But when N is very large, the polygon is almost a circle, so R would be approximately a / cos(π/N), but for large N, cos(π/N) approaches 1 - ( (π/N)^2 ) / 2. Hmm, but maybe that's more detail than I need right now.

The light is falling along the z-axis, so the aperture is in the x-y plane. The far field region implies we're looking at the diffraction pattern far from the aperture. For a circular aperture, the far-field diffraction pattern is given by the Bessel functions, and the minima occur at specific angles. But since this is a polygon, which in the limit becomes a circle, but perhaps the approach is similar.

Wait, no, because the problem says when N is infinitely large, so it's circular, so maybe the answer is the same as the first minima for a circular aperture. Wait, no, wait, the first minima in the diffraction pattern for a single slit is at angle θ where sinθ = λ/(a), but wait, no, wait: for a single slit of width 'a', the minima are at θ where a sinθ = mλ, m=1,2,...

But wait, the options here don't have λ/a, they have terms like λ/a multiplied by a number. The options are A) 0.610 λ/a, B) 0.5, etc.

Wait, but wait: the problem is not a single slit, it's a multi-slit or an aperture of polygonal shape. But when N is very large, the polygon becomes a circle. So maybe the diffraction pattern becomes the same as a circular aperture.

Wait, for a circular aperture, the diffraction pattern (Airy disc) has its minima at certain angles. The first minimum occurs at θ where sinθ ≈ 1.220 λ/(π a), because the first zero of the Bessel function J1 is at x ≈ 3.8317, so 1.220 comes from 3.8317/(π) ≈ 1.220. So the first minimum is at θ = 1.220 λ/(a), but wait, wait
