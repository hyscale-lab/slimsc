Okay, so I'm trying to figure out where this density matrix ρ is located in the qubit space. Hmm, I remember that a density matrix describes the state of a quantum system, especially when it's mixed or in a statistical ensemble.

The given ρ is (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). Wait, that looks familiar. Oh right! That's the maximally mixed state for a single qubit. Because when you have |0><0| and |1><1|, each multiplied by 1/2, it means the qubit is in a completely mixed state, like a classical mixture of the two basis states.

But how does this relate to the geometry in qubit space? I think qubit states can be represented on the Bloch sphere. Pure states are on the surface, while mixed states are inside. The maximally mixed state should be at the center because it's the most mixed possible.

Wait, the Bloch sphere has a certain representation. The density matrix of a single qubit can be written in terms of the Bloch vector. The general form is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices and r is a vector (r_x, r_y, r_z). 

Let me compute ρ. Let's expand it:

ρ = (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|).

We know that |0><0| is [[1,0],[0,0]], and |1><1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. Adding them gives [[1,0],[0,1]], which is the identity matrix. So ρ is (I)/2.

Wait, because (1/2)(I) is ρ. So substituting into the Bloch form: I/2 = (I + r·σ)/2. Multiply both sides by 2: I = I + r·σ. Subtract I: 0 = r·σ. So r must be zero vector. So r = (0,0,0).

Looking at the options, option C is (0,0,0). So the answer should be C.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents the maximally mixed state for a single qubit. In the Bloch sphere representation, the density matrix of a single qubit can be expressed as 

\[
\rho = \frac{I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}}{2},
\]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix, \(\boldsymbol{\sigma}\) are the Pauli matrices, and \(\mathbf{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z)\) is the Bloch vector. For the given \(\rho\), expanding the terms shows that it simplifies to \(\rho = \frac{I}{2}\). Comparing this with the general form, it follows that \(\mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0)\), meaning the state is at the center of the Bloch sphere. This corresponds to the maximally mixed state.

Among the options provided, the correct geometrical position in qubit space is \(r = (0, 0, 0)\).

Answer: C
