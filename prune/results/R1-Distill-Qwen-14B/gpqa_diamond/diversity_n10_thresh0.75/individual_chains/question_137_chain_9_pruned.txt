Okay, so I've got this physics problem about a synchrocyclotron, and I'm a bit rusty on this topic, but let's try to work through it step by step. 

The question says that a proton is injected into a synchrocyclotron at t=0 with negligible kinetic energy, which is like saying it starts from rest. Then, it undergoes two accelerations to reach a kinetic energy of T1 = 950 MeV. The voltage applied is given by U(t) = U0 cos[2πν(α)t + Φ0], where U0 is 190 kV and Φ0 is π/4. The options are about how many revolutions the proton makes.

Wait, wait. Synchrocyclotrons are a type of cyclotron, right? They are used to accelerate charged particles. I remember that in a cyclotron, particles move in a magnetic field and get accelerated by an electric field that alternates in phase with their circular motion. Each time the particle completes a half-cycle of the electric field, it gains some energy. 

But wait, in a regular cyclotron, the frequency of the electric field is fixed, but the particle's frequency changes as it gains energy because the mass increases relativistically. Synchrocyclotron is a modified version where the frequency of the electric field is adjusted to match the particle's changing frequency as it gets accelerated. Oh right, so the frequency ν(α) depends on the particle's energy. 

So the problem is asking for the number of revolutions the proton makes. Hmm. Each revolution would correspond to a full cycle of the electric field, right? But wait, since the proton is being accelerated each time it passes through the electric field's maximum, maybe each half-cycle (like each 180 degrees) it gains some energy. Or wait, perhaps each time the field is in the right phase, the proton gets a kick. 

Wait, in a cyclotron, the time between each acceleration is the period of the magnetic field's frequency. But since the proton's velocity changes, the period changes. Synchrocyclotrons adjust the frequency so that the electric field is in phase with the particle's motion at all times. 

So the steps I think I need to take are:

1. Find the total kinetic energy the proton gains
