Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about a diatomic molecule. Hmm, diatomic means it's made of two atoms, right? The atoms are X and Y. The question is about the quantum rotation-vibration model, or the non-rigid rotor model. Wait, I think the rigid rotor model assumes the bond length doesn't change, but the non-rigid one allows for some vibration. So the molecule can both rotate and vibrate.

The question says the molecule is in its fundamental state. Fundamental state is the lowest energy state, I think. So the first excited state would be the next lowest. They want to find the momentum of a photon that's absorbed to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy.

Wait, so the molecule is currently in the fundamental state, and when it absorbs a photon, it transitions to the next possible state. But what's that state? Since the molecule has both rotational and vibrational energy levels, the next state could be either a higher vibrational state or a higher rotational state. But the problem says it's the next state with the lowest possible energy, so I think that's the first excited state, which would be a combination of the two.

Wait, the quantum rotation-vibration model probably considers the energy levels as a combination of rotation and vibration. So the energy levels are quantized and depend on both rotational quantum number (like J) and vibrational quantum number (like ν). 

In the rigid rotor model, the rotational energy levels are given by E_rot = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant. For vibration, in the harmonic oscillator model, the vibrational energy levels are E_vib = (ν + 1/2) h w, where ν is the vibrational quantum number.

But wait, the question mentions the non-rigid rotor model. I think that introduces some coupling between rotation and vibration, maybe due to the bond length changing, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the non-rigid rotor allows for the rotational energy to depend on the vibrational state. But for this problem, maybe I can treat the rotational and vibrational parts separately.

The molecule is in the fundamental state, which is the lowest energy state. So the vibrational state is ν=0, and the rotational state is J=0. Because the fundamental state is the lowest, so both are at their lowest energy.

When the molecule absorbs a photon, it will transition to the next higher state. Now, the next state could be either increasing J by 1 while keeping ν=0
