Alright, I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem. So the question is about two energy levels and their distinguishability. Let me read it again.

Okay, the setup: two quantum states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds. We need to find which energy difference allows us to clearly resolve these two levels.

Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the uncertainty principle plays a role here. Oh right, the energy-time uncertainty principle. The formula is ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. So the product of the uncertainty in energy and the time interval should be around ħ over 2.

Wait, but how does that apply here? Oh, right, the lifetime of the state is related to the uncertainty in energy. The longer the lifetime (Δt), the smaller the energy uncertainty. So if the lifetimes are given, we can calculate the minimum energy difference needed for them to be distinguishable.

Wait, no, maybe the other way around. For two states to be resolved, their energy difference must be greater than the uncertainty in energy; otherwise, their lines (emitted photons) would overlap, making it hard to tell them apart.

So for each state, calculate the uncertainty in energy, and then the energy difference between E1 and E2 must be larger than the sum of their uncertainties, perhaps?

Wait, but the question says the two states have different lifetimes. So each has a different uncertainty. Let me think. Let me denote the lifetimes as τ1 = 1e-9 s and τ2 = 1e-8 s.

The uncertainty principle for each state would be ΔE_i ≈ ħ/(2 τ_i), where i is 1 or 2.

So for state 1, ΔE1 ≈ ħ/(2 τ1) = ħ/(2 * 1e-9).
For state 2, ΔE2 ≈ ħ/(2 τ2) = ħ/(2 * 1e-8).

Wait, but the energy difference needs to be bigger than both uncertainties, I guess. Because otherwise, one's uncertainty is bigger than the other and they might overlap. Or perhaps the energy difference should be larger than the sum of the two uncertainties. Hmm, I'm a bit fuzzy on that.

Wait, perhaps the energy resolution is determined by the uncertainty in energy of each state. To clearly distinguish the two levels, the energy difference should be larger than the sum of the uncertainties, or perhaps the maximum of the two. Or maybe just larger than each individual uncertainty. Hmm, I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, another approach: the energy difference ΔE = |E2 - E1| must be such that the corresponding energy-time uncertainty allows their signals to be separated. So perhaps the minimal ΔE is when ΔE is greater than the uncertainty associated with the shorter lifetime?

Wait, let me think in terms of the Fourier transform. The lifetime τ is the time over which the state exists. The Fourier transform relates the time of the pulse to the energy (frequency) spread. A longer pulse (larger τ) has a narrower frequency spread. So the uncertainty ΔE is inversely proportional to τ.

So for each state, the uncertainty is ħ/(2 τ). So for state 1, with τ1=1e-9 s, ΔE1 ≈ ħ/(2e-9) = (something) eV.

Wait, but what's the value of ħ in eV·s? I think ħ is approximately 6.582e-16 eV·s. Let me confirm: Planck's constant h is about 6.626e-34 J·s. Since 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J, then ħ in eV·s is h/(2π) which is approximately 6.582e-16 eV·s. Yes, that's correct.

So let's compute ΔE1 and ΔE2.

ΔE1 = ħ/(2 τ1) = (6.582e-16 eV·s) / (2 * 1e-9 s) = (6.582e-16) / (2e-9) ) eV.

Calculating that: 6.582e-16 / 2e-9 = (6.582 / 2) * 1e-7 = 3.291e-7 eV.

Wait, that's 3.291e-7 eV. So about 3.3e-7 eV.

Then ΔE2 = ħ/(2 τ2) = (6.582e-16) / (2 * 1e-8) = (6.582e-16) / (2e-8) ) eV.

Calculating that: 6.582e-16 / 2e-8 = (6.582 / 2) * 1e-8 = 3.291e-8 eV. So 3.291e-8 eV.

Wait, so the uncertainty for state 1 is larger than that of state 2. Because τ1 is smaller than τ2. So the shorter the lifetime, the larger the energy uncertainty.

So for the two states to be distinguishable, the energy difference between E1 and E2 needs to be larger than both of their individual uncertainties.

Because if the difference is less than either uncertainty, the lines would overlap, making it impossible to resolve.

Wait, but wait, no. Because each state's energy is uncertain by their own ΔE. So E1 is in [E1 - ΔE1/2, E1 + ΔE1/2], and E2 is in [E2 - ΔE2/2, E2 + ΔE2/2]. To have these intervals not overlap, the difference between E2 and E1 must be larger than (ΔE1 + ΔE2) / 2.

Wait, no, wait. Let's think about the separation. If E2 is higher than E1, then the lower edge of E2 is E2 - ΔE2 /2, and the upper edge of E1 is E1 + ΔE1 /2. To avoid overlap, E2 - ΔE2/2 > E1 + ΔE1 /2. So the energy difference (E2 - E1) must be larger than (ΔE1/2 + ΔE2/2) ) * 2? No, wait. Let me compute.

Let me model the two energy levels as Gaussian peaks in an energy spectrum. Each has a certain width (full width at half maximum, perhaps). For them to be resolvable, the separation between their centers should be at least the sum of their half-widths.

But wait, the energy-time uncertainty gives a standard deviation-like uncertainty, not a half-max. So perhaps the full width would be something like 2ΔE for each. Or maybe it's a Gaussian, so the FWHM is about 2.355σ, where σ is the standard deviation, which is ΔE.

But when considering the separation, the minimal distance between centers is at least the sum of their half-widths at a certain level, like the half-max. So perhaps to have two peaks not overlapping, the separation should be larger than the sum of their half-widths.

But perhaps for simplicity, the problem is considering energy differences larger than the maximum of the two uncertainties.

Wait, but let's proceed with the first approach. The minimal ΔE required is that E2 - E1 ≥ (ΔE1 + ΔE2)/2 × 2? Hmm, perhaps that's overcomplicating.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy difference should be larger than the sum of the individual uncertainties. So ΔE ≥ ΔE1 + ΔE2.

But let me compute both ΔE1 and ΔE2 first.

ΔE1 = 3.291e-7 eV.
ΔE2 = 3.291e-8 eV.

So sum is 3.62e-7 eV.

But looking at the options, the choices are 1e-9, 1e-11, 1e-4, 1e-8.

Wait, 1e-4 eV is 0.0001 eV, which is much larger than the sum of uncertainties. Because the sum is ~3.6e-7 eV. So 1e-4 eV is about 277 times larger than the sum.

So if the energy difference is 1e-4 eV, that's way larger than the sum of their uncertainties. So that would easily be distinguishable.

Wait, but perhaps the problem is considering that the energy difference must be greater than the individual uncertainty of each. Because each state's energy is uncertain by their own ΔE. So if the energy difference is larger than the maximum of ΔE1 and ΔE2, then the states are distinguishable.

In this case, ΔE1 is 3.29e-7 eV and ΔE2 is 3.29e-8 eV. So the maximum is about 3.29e-7 eV. So the energy difference between E1 and E2 must be greater than 3.29e-7 eV.

But looking at the options, none of them are that. Let me check the options again.

Options:
A) 1e-9 eV → 0.001e-7 eV. Less than 3.29e-7. So not enough.

B) 1e-11 eV → even smaller. No.

C) 1e-4 eV → 0.0001 eV, which is 1e-4 = 1e-4 eV. Wait, 1e-4 is much bigger than 3.29e-7. Because 1e-4 is 1e3 times larger than 1e-7. So 3.29e-7 is about 0.000329 eV. So 1e-4 is 0.0001 eV, wait wait, no. Wait, 1e-4 is 0.0001 eV. 3.29e-7 is 0.000000329 eV. So 1e-4 is much larger than 3.29e-7. So that's way beyond the required.

Wait, but wait, 3.29e-7 eV is about 3.29e-7 eV. So 1e-4 eV is larger than that. So the energy difference would be easily distinguishable.

Wait, but option C is 1e-4 eV, which is much larger than the required ΔE. So that would be a possible answer.

Wait, but what about option D: 1e-8 eV. Hmm, 1e-8 is 0.1e-7 eV. The maximum of the uncertainties is approximately 3.29e-7 eV. So 1e-8 is 0.0329e-7, which is way smaller than the maximum uncertainty.

So in that case, the energy difference being 1e-8 eV would be smaller than the maximum uncertainty between the two. So the two states would not be distinguishable.

So the correct answer should be option C, 1e-4 eV, because that's way larger than the sum or the maximum of the uncertainties.

Wait, but let me think again. Did I get the formula correctly? Because the energy-time uncertainty is ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2.

Wait, and in this problem, the Δt is the lifetime τ of each state, right? So for each, the uncertainty is ΔE = ħ/(2 τ). So for τ1=1e-9 s, ΔE1= (6.582e-16 eV s)/(2e-9 s) ) = (6.582e-16)/(2e-9) = 3.291e-7 eV.

Yes. And τ2 is 1e-8 s, so ΔE2= (6.582e-16)/(2e-8) )= 3.291e-8 eV.

So the maximum uncertainty is approximately 3.29e-7 eV.

So the energy difference must be larger than that. So the energy difference must be greater than ~3.3e-7 eV.

Looking at the options, the only one that is larger is option C, 1e-4 eV. Because 1e-4 eV is 0.0001 eV, which is 1e-4 eV. That's way larger than 3.3e-7 eV.

Wait, but option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 0.0001 eV.

So the correct answer must be option C.


To determine the energy difference required to clearly distinguish two quantum states with energies \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \), we use the energy-time uncertainty principle:

\[
\Delta E \cdot \Delta t \approx \frac{\hbar}{2},
\]

where \( \Delta E \) is the uncertainty in energy and \( \Delta t \) is the lifetime of the state. For each state, the uncertainty in energy is given by:

\[
\Delta E_i = \frac{\hbar}{2 \tau_i},
\]

where \( \tau_i \) is the lifetime of the \( i \)-th state. The reduced Planck's constant \( \hbar \) is approximately \( 6.582 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{eV·s} \).

### Step 1: Calculate the energy uncertainties
For the first state with \( \tau_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \):
\[
\Delta E_1 = \frac{\hbar}{2 \tau_1} = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-16}}{2 \times 10^{-9}} = 3.291 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
\]

For the second state with \( \tau_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \):
\[
\Delta E_2 = \frac{\hbar}{2 \tau_2} = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-16}}{2 \times 10^{-8}} = 3.291 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}.
\]

### Step 2: Determine the energy difference requirement
To clearly distinguish the two energy levels, the energy difference \( \Delta E = |E_2 - E_1| \) must be greater than the sum of their uncertainties:

\[
\Delta E > \Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2.
\]

Substituting the values:
\[
\Delta E > 3.291 \times 10^{-7} + 3.291 \times 10^{-8} = 3.620 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
\]

### Step 3: Analyze the options
- **Option A: \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is \( 1 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \), which is much smaller than \( 3.620 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Not sufficient.

- **Option B: \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is \( 1 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \), which is even smaller than \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \). Not sufficient.

- **Option C: \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is \( 1 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \), which is \( 277 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), far larger than \( 3.620 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Sufficient.

- **Option D: \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is \( 1 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \), which is smaller than \( 3.620 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Not sufficient.

### Conclusion
The energy difference must be at least \( 3.620 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \) to distinguish the two states. Among the options, only \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \) satisfies this condition.
