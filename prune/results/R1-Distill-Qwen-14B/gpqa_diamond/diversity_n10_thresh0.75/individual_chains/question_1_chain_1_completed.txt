Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here. Hmm, let me think. The question is about two quantum states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are given as 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. We need to figure out what their energy difference should be so that we can clearly distinguish between them. The options are A to D, each with different energy values.

Wait, I remember that the uncertainty principle comes into play here. Right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. It says that the product of the uncertainty in energy and the uncertainty in time must be at least on the order of ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. So, mathematically, ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2.

But wait, in the context of energy levels and their lifetimes, the lifetime here probably refers to the mean lifetime, which is related to the uncertainty in time, Δt. The energy uncertainty ΔE is then roughly ħ divided by the lifetime. Because for a state with a short lifetime (like 10^-9 seconds), the energy uncertainty is larger, making it harder to resolve small energy differences.

So the idea is that to distinguish two energy levels, the energy difference between them must be larger than the uncertainty in energy. Otherwise, the two states would be too close together, and we can't tell them apart. So the energy difference ΔE must be greater than ħ divided by the mean lifetime of the states.

Wait, but which lifetime do I use? Each state has its own lifetime. Oh, but the question says the two states have different lifetimes. Hmm, perhaps I should consider the broader uncertainty. Wait, no. The energy uncertainty for each state is ΔE1 = ħ/τ1 and ΔE2 = ħ/τ2. Since τ1 is 1e-9 s, ΔE1 would be larger than ΔE2 because τ2 is longer (1e-8 s), so ΔE2 is smaller.

Wait, but when considering the energy difference between the two states, which uncertainty dominates? Or perhaps the total energy uncertainty when considering both states? Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, maybe the minimal energy difference needed is the sum of the uncertainties of each state. Because if both states have their own uncertainties, the combined uncertainty would be the sum. So for the energy difference to be resolvable, it must be greater than the sum of their individual uncertainties.

Wait, but I'm not sure about that. Another approach: the energy difference ΔE = E2 - E1. To resolve them, ΔE must be greater than the uncertainty in energy for each. So each ΔE must be greater than their respective uncertainties.

Wait, no. The uncertainty principle applies to each state. So for state 1, the uncertainty is ΔE1 = ħ/τ1. For state 2, ΔE2 = ħ/τ2. To distinguish the two states, the energy difference must be larger than the maximum of these two uncertainties. Because otherwise, if the energy difference is smaller than the uncertainty of the state with the larger energy uncertainty, their energies would overlap.

Wait, let's compute the uncertainties. Let's calculate ħ divided by each lifetime.

But wait, what's the value of ħ? Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626e-34 J·s. So ħ is h/(2π), which is approximately 1.055e-34 J·s.

But I think it's easier to work in eV·seconds units. Because the options are in eV. I remember that 1 eV is approximately 1.602e-19 J. So let's compute ħ in eV·s.

So, ħ = 1.055e-34 J·s. To convert to eV·s, divide by 1.602e-19 J/eV:

ħ ≈ 1.055e-34 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 6.582e-16 eV·s.

So, ħ ≈ 6.58e-16 eV·s.

Now, let's compute ΔE for each state.

For state 1: τ1 = 1e-9 s.

ΔE1 = ħ / τ1 ≈ 6.58e-16 eV·s / 1e-9 s = 6.58e-7 eV.

Hmm, wait that's 6.58e-7 eV. That's 0.000658 eV. For state 2, τ2 is 1e-8 s.

ΔE2 = ħ / τ2 ≈ 6.58e-16 / 1e-8 = 6.58e-8 eV. So 0.0000658 eV.

Wait, so the uncertainty in E for state 1 is about 6.58e-7 eV, and for state 2 it's about 6.58e-8 eV. So the larger uncertainty is from state 1.

Wait, but when we're talking about the energy difference between the two states, E2 - E1, the uncertainty in that difference would be the sum of their individual uncertainties, assuming the uncertainties are independent.

Wait, no. Because the uncertainty in E1 is ΔE1 and in E2 is ΔE2. The difference would have an uncertainty of sqrt(ΔE1² + ΔE2²), but since ΔE1 is much larger than ΔE2, this would be approximately ΔE1.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. The energy difference must be greater than the sum of the uncertainties in each energy. Because if E2 - E1 is smaller than the maximum of ΔE1 and ΔE2, they might not be distinguishable.

Wait, no, perhaps it's the other way. The energy difference must be larger than the maximum of the two uncertainties. Because if the difference is less than the uncertainty of one of them, you can't be sure they're different.

Wait, let me think about it. Suppose E2 - E1 is less than the uncertainty of E1, then E2 could be within the uncertainty range of E1, making them appear the same.

Alternatively, it's more precise to say that to resolve two states, the energy difference must be larger than the sum of the uncertainties of both. Because each state has some spread, the total spread between them is the sum.

Wait, no. I think the correct approach is that the minimum energy difference ΔE needed is larger than the sum of the uncertainties of each state.

So ΔE > ΔE1 + ΔE2.

Wait, but let's compute that.

ΔE1 = 6.58e-7 eV.

ΔE2 = 6.58e-8 eV.

So ΔE1 + ΔE2 ≈ 6.58e-7 + 0.658e-7 = approx 7.24e-7 eV.

So the energy difference must be greater than about 7.2e-7 eV. Let's look at the options:

Option A: 1e-9 eV → 0.001e-6 → 0.000001 eV. That's way smaller than 7.2e-7 eV. So not enough.

Option B: 1e-11 eV → even smaller. No.

Option C: 1e-4 eV → 0.0001 eV. That's 1e-4, which is way larger than 7.2e-7. So this would be resolvable.

Option D: 1e-8 eV → 0.00000001 eV. That's 1e-8, which is smaller than 7.2e-7. So not enough.

Wait, so the correct answer would be option C.

But wait, let me double-check. Because sometimes the energy difference needs to be larger than the uncertainty in the measurement, which is determined by the time over which the energy is measured. Alternatively, perhaps the uncertainty in the energy is ħ/τ, but if the states have different lifetimes, the uncertainty for each is different.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy difference must be greater than the larger of the two uncertainties. Because the state with the shorter lifetime has a larger uncertainty. So if the energy difference is larger than ΔE1, then it's resolvable.

In that case, let's see:

ΔE1 is 6.58e-7 eV. So the energy difference must be greater than 6.58e-7 eV.

Looking at the options, only option C (1e-4 eV) is larger than 6.58e-7. Because 1e-4 is 1e-4, which is 0.0001, while 6.58e-7 is 0.000000658. So 1e-4 is larger.

Yes, so the energy difference must be bigger than the larger individual uncertainty, which is ΔE1.

So the correct answer is option C, 1e-4 eV.


To distinguish two quantum states with energies \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \), the energy difference \( \Delta E = E_2 - E_1 \) must be greater than the uncertainty in energy for each state, which is determined by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle: 

\[
\Delta E \cdot \Delta t \approx \frac{\hbar}{2}.
\]

Here, \( \Delta t \) is the mean lifetime of the state, and \( \Delta E \) is the corresponding energy uncertainty. For a state with a shorter lifetime, the energy uncertainty is larger, and vice versa. The lifetimes of the two states are given as \( \tau_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \) and \( \tau_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \). Using \( \hbar \approx 6.58 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{eV·s} \), the energy uncertainties are:

\[
\Delta E_1 = \frac{\hbar}{\tau_1} \approx \frac{6.58 \times 10^{-16}}{10^{-9}} = 6.58 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV},
\]
\[
\Delta E_2 = \frac{\hbar}{\tau_2} \approx \frac{6.58 \times 10^{-16}}{10^{-8}} = 6.58 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}.
\]

The larger uncertainty is \( \Delta E_1 = 6.58 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). To resolve the two energy levels, the energy difference \( \Delta E \) must be greater than this uncertainty. Examining the options:

- **Option A: \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \)** — This is \( 0.001 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{eV} \), which is much smaller than \( 6.58 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Not sufficient.
- **Option B: \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \)** — This is even smaller than \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \). Not sufficient.
- **Option C: \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \)** — This is \( 0.0001 \, \text{eV} \), which is much larger than \( 6.58 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Sufficient.
- **Option D: \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \)** — This is \( 0.00000001 \, \text{eV} \), which is smaller than \( 6.58 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Not sufficient.

Thus, the energy difference must be at least \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \) to clearly distinguish the two energy levels.
