Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me see what the question is about. 

Alright, the problem is about a star whose surface is sometimes covered by dark spots. When the spots aren't there, the star's effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. The question is about the ratio of neutral Titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels, level 1 and level 2. They observe that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. I need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star is spotless compared to when it has spots.

Hmm. So when there are spots, the ratio goes down. So the ratio when no spots (R1) is higher than when spots are present (R2). The factor would be R1/R2.

The problem says the transition between these levels corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 Å. And it's in the stellar photosphere under LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), which I think means I can use the Boltzmann equation for this scenario.

I remember that in LTE, the ratio of populations of two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann factor. The formula is n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) ), where g is the statistical weight, E is the energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, T is the temperature.

Wait, but in this case, the ratio is n_level1 / n_level2. So it would be the inverse of that. So the ratio R = n1 / n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

Because the ratio is n1/n2. So when the temperature changes, this ratio will change as well.

The transition wavelength is 1448 Å. That should be related to the energy difference between the two levels. Oh, right, because the energy of a photon is E = hc / λ. So E2 - E1 = hc/λ.

So first, I can calculate the energy difference using λ = 1448 Å. Let me think about the constants: h is Planck's constant, c is speed of light. I might need to convert the wavelength into meters for calculations.

Wait, 1448 Å is 1.448e-7 meters. Hmm.

But wait, the star's temperature changes from 6000 K to 5500 K on average when spots are present. But the spots are cooler regions on the star. So when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric temperature drops. But wait, the problem says when the surface isn't covered, the Teff is 6000 K, and when 40% is covered, the Teff is 5500 K. So the entire photosphere's effective temperature is 5500 K when spots are present. Or does the presence of spots just affect the observed flux?

Wait, the problem says when the star's surface is not covered, the
