Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

So, the problem is about a star with certain characteristics. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. When it's not covered by dark spots, its effective temperature is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall effective temperature drops to 5500 K. The question is about the ratio of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2) in the stellar photosphere when the star has spots versus when it doesn't.

Hmm. I remember that the ratio of populations in two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann equation. The Boltzmann factor, which depends on the temperature, right? The formula is something like (n2)/(n1) = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k*T) ), where g is the statistical weight, E is the energy difference, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

Wait, but in this case, the observed ratio decreases when the star has spots. So, when the star has spots, the overall temperature of the photosphere is lower, which affects the ratio. So, I need to find the ratio when there are no spots (T = 6000 K) and when there are spots (T = 5500 K). Then, the factor is R_no_spots / R_spots.

But wait, no, the question says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So the ratio is lower during spots. Therefore, the factor by which it changes is (R_no_spots / R_with_spots). Let me make sure I get the ratio right.

The problem states that the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So, let's say when the star doesn't have spots, the ratio is R1, and when it does have spots, it's R2. So R1 > R2. The factor is R1/R2.

The transition between the two levels corresponds to a wavelength of 1448 Å. I think that the energy difference between the levels can be calculated using the wavelength. Because the energy of a photon is E = hc/λ. So, knowing λ, I can find ΔE = E2 - E1.

Let me compute ΔE first. The wavelength λ is 1448 Å, which is 1.448e-6 meters. Planck's constant h is about 6.626e-34 J·s, and the speed of light c is 3e8 m/s.

So ΔE = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1.448e-6) = let me compute that.

Wait, 6.626e-34 * 3e8
