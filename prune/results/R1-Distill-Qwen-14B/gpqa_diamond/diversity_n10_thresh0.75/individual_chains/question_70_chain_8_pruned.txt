Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm going to try to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The problem talks about several reactions and gives a bunch of information. I need to find the molecular symmetry group of product E. The options are symmetry groups like C2, D4h, D∞h, and C2v.

Hmm, I remember that molecular symmetry groups are based on the highest symmetry operations an object has. So, things like mirror planes, rotation axes, etc. The groups are named using symbols like Cn, Dnh, Td, Oh, I think.

Let me try to break down the reactions given.

First, solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. Wait, 8 equivalents... that seems like a stoichiometric ratio. Maybe it's something like 1 mole A reacting with 8 moles B. What kind of reaction would involve such a ratio? Maybe something like a metal reacting with a gas, like O2 or Cl2.

Next, product C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce product E, which is extremely hazardous. That suggests maybe a toxic gas or something like phosgene or another highly reactive substance.

Then, C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. So, when C is hydrolyzed, it produces two acids. Strong and weak. Hmm, I'm thinking maybe C is some kind of anhydride? Because anhydrides upon hydrolysis give acids. For example, if C is a sulfuryl chloride, like SOCl2, then hydrolysis would give H2SO4 (strong) and HCl (strong), but wait, the problem says F is strong and G is weak. Alternatively, maybe C is something else.

Wait, another thought: what about something like a metal chloride? No, because hydrolysis of metal chloride might not give two acids. Or perhaps C is a sulfate ester or something else. Hmm.

Wait, another angle: the last clue is that D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent. Common solvents might be something like H2O, or perhaps something like ethanol, but D and B reacting to form a solvent. Let me think about common solvent reactions.

If B is a diatomic gas, like O2, Cl2, maybe SO2? Alternatively, if B is O2, then D might be something else. Let's see, if D is H2, and B is O2, then D + B would be H2O, but that's not a solvent in this context. Or perhaps D is H2O reacting with B to form something else. Wait, but H2O is a solvent, but D reacts with B. Hmm.

Wait, D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent. So maybe H is H2O? No, because H2O is not a product of D and B. Let me think. Maybe B is O2 and D is H2, which when they react, they form H2O, which is a solvent. But I'm not sure if that's the right path.

Alternatively, perhaps B is Cl2 and D is H2O. Wait no, because Cl2 plus H2O (with some conditions) gives HClO and HCl, but that's not a solvent. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps H is something like ethanol or something. But I'm not making progress there. Let me go back to the first reactions.

First reaction: A + 8 B → C. Let's think about possible reactions where a solid reacts with a gas in an 8:1 ratio. One possibility is aluminum reacting with chlorine gas. Aluminum reacts with Cl2 in a 3:4 ratio, but 8 is a different number. Alternatively, maybe a transition metal? Or perhaps something like a reaction where a metal like Na reacts with something.

Wait, wait, the product C is bright red. So what bright red products are formed when metals react with gases? Maybe something like Cu reacting with sulfur vapor to form CuS? No, that's not red. Alternatively, maybe a reaction that forms a red solid, like Fe2O3 is reddish, but maybe not bright red. Alternatively, maybe a reaction forms a red oxide. Or perhaps a product like SO3? No, that's colorless. Hmm.

Another thought: maybe the reaction is between a metal and O2. For example, aluminum when burned in O2 gives Al2O3, which is white. Not red. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe vanadium pentoxide is orange, but not red. Maybe it's something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is between a metal and Cl2. For example, Mg reacts with Cl2 to form MgCl2. But that's white. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps C is a compound that is bright red. One possibility is HgO, which is red. But what would react to form HgO? Hg is a liquid, so maybe that's not solid A. Alternatively, maybe it
