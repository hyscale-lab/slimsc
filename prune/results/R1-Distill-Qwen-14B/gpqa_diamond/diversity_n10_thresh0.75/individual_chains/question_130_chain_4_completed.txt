Okay, so I've got this question about astronomy and redshift. Hmm, let me think. The question is about large clouds of neutral hydrogen in deep space absorbing light from background quasars at the Lyman alpha wavelength, which is about 1216 Angstroms. The question is asking for the lower limit on the redshift of these objects so that they can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes.

Wait, redshift... right. Redshift tells us how much the wavelength of light has been stretched due to the expansion of the universe. The formula I remember is z = (observed wavelength - emitted wavelength) / emitted wavelength. So for Lyman alpha, the emitted wavelength is 1216 Angstroms, but when it's redshifted, it's longer.

But wait, ground-based telescopes can't detect certain wavelengths because the atmosphere absorbs them. Oh right, the atmosphere is opaque to certain ultraviolet and infrared light. So for optical telescopes, they can only see visible light, which is about 400-700 nm. Wait, but wait, 1216 Angstroms is 121.6 nm, which is in the far ultraviolet. So if the Lyman alpha line is redshifted into the optical range, that would mean the observed wavelength is in the visible spectrum.

So the idea is that the quasar's Lyman alpha emission is at 1216 Angstroms, which is in the UV. But if there's a higher redshift, this wavelength would be stretched into the optical range that telescopes can see from the ground. So the lower limit would be when the wavelength just enters the optical range.

Wait, but what's the optical range? Let me think. Visible light is approximately from 400 nm (violet) to 700 nm (red). So the observed wavelength λ_obs must be at least 400 nm for a ground-based optical telescope to detect it. Because wavelengths below 400 nm are ultraviolet and the atmosphere blocks them.

So, λ_obs = λ_emit * (1 + z). So we set λ_obs to 400 nm. But wait, the emitted wavelength is 1216 Angstroms, which is 121.6 nm. So 121.6 * (1+z) = 400 nm. Solving for z: (1+z) = 400 / 121.6 ≈ 3.29. So z ≈ 2.29. So the redshift needs to be at least about 2.29 for the Lyman alpha line to be visible in the optical.

Looking at the options, option C is 2.4 and option D is 1.9. So 2.29 is closest to option C, 2.4. But wait, wait a second. Maybe I should check the calculation again.

Calculating 400 divided by 121.6: 400 / 121.6 = let's compute that. 121.6 * 3 = 364.8. 400 - 364.8=35.2. 35.2/121.6= approximately 0.289. So 3 + 0.289 = 3.289. So 1 + z = 3.289, so z=2.289. So about 2.29.

So the lower limit is when the observed wavelength is 400 nm, which gives z≈2.29. So the minimum redshift is just above 2.29. So among the options, the next higher one is 2.4 (option C). But wait, another thought: Maybe the optical range starts a bit higher than 400 nm? Or perhaps I should consider the limit where the wavelength is just into the optical, which would be the minimum.

Alternatively, maybe the question is considering the lower limit as the point where the Lyman alpha is just within the observable range. So if the redshift is too low, the wavelength is still in UV and can't be detected. So the minimum z is when λ_obs is 400 nm.

Wait another thing: Do ground-based telescopes observe in the entire visible spectrum? I think the cutoff is around 300 nm, but most of the UV is blocked. So perhaps the threshold is higher, like 320 nm? Hmm, but I'm not entirely sure. I think the atmospheric window for optical is roughly 300-700 nm, but most ground-based telescopes can't observe below about 320 nm because of the ozone layer and other absorptions.

Wait, maybe the Lyman break is at 912 Angstroms (91.2 nm), which is the Lyman limit. So anything below that is absorbed. So the quasar's Lyman alpha is at 1216 Angstroms, which is above the Lyman limit. So if the observed wavelength is above 912 Angstroms, it's in the far UV and can't be observed. But when redshifted beyond that, it enters the optical.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me rephrase. The Lyman alpha line is emitted at 1216 Angstroms (121.6 nm). If the cloud is at redshift z, the observed wavelength is 121.6 * (1 + z). To be in the optical (visible light), this must be greater than 400 nm.

Wait, 400 nm is 4000 Angstroms. So 121.6 * (1 + z) >= 4000 Angstroms.

Wait, no, wait. 1216 Angstroms is 121.6 nm. So 121.6 nm * (1 + z) >= 400 nm.

So (1 + z) >= 400 / 121.6 = approx 3.29. So z >= 2.29.

But wait, 400 nm is 4000 Angstroms, so 4000 / 1216 ≈ 3.29. So yeah, same result.

So the redshift has to be at least approximately 2.29 for the Lyman alpha line to be in the optical. So the lower limit is z=2.29.

Looking at the options, option C is 2.4, which is the closest above 2.29. So the answer should be option C.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the question is considering the limit where the line is just in the optical. So if the redshift is lower than 2.29, the line is in the UV and can't be detected. So the lower limit is z=2.29, so any object with z higher than that would have the line in optical.

So the lower limit is z=2.29, so the answer is the smallest option that's larger than this. The options are A)3, B)1.2, C)2.4, D)1.9.

So 2.29 is between C (2.4) and D (1.9). Oh wait, no, 2.29 is between 2 and 3. 2.4 is higher than 2.29, so the lower limit is 2.29, so the minimum redshift is 2.29. So the objects must have z >=2.29.

So the lower limit is approximately 2.29, but the options don't have this exactly. So the question is about the estimate. The options given are 2.4 (C) and 1.9 (D). So the correct lower limit is about 2.3, which is just under option C. So the lower limit is just over 2.29, so the minimum acceptable redshift is 2.3. So the next higher option is 2.4. Therefore, the answer is C, 2.4.

Wait, but perhaps the question is asking for the lower limit on the object's redshift such that the absorption is in the optical. So, the lower limit is the minimal z for which the Lyman-alpha is just in the optical. So the answer is the minimal z, which is 2.29, but since the options don't have that, the closest higher is 2.4.


To determine the lower limit on the redshift of large clouds of neutral hydrogen such that their Lyman alpha absorption (emitted at 1216 Å or 121.6 nm) can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes, we need to consider the redshift formula:

\[
z = \frac{\lambda_{\text{obs}} - \lambda_{\text{emit}}}{\lambda_{\text{emit}}}
\]

Here, the emitted wavelength is \( \lambda_{\text{emit}} = 1216 \, \text{Å} = 121.6 \, \text{nm} \), and the observed wavelength \( \lambda_{\text{obs}} \) must fall within the optical range of ground-based telescopes, which is approximately \( 400 \, \text{nm} \) (or \( 4000 \, \text{Å} \)) to \( 700 \, \text{nm} \). For the Lyman alpha line to be detectable, the observed wavelength must be at least \( 400 \, \text{nm} \).

Rearranging the redshift formula:

\[
\lambda_{\text{obs}} = \lambda_{\text{emit}} \cdot (1 + z)
\]

Substituting \( \lambda_{\text{obs}} = 400 \, \text{nm} \) and \( \lambda_{\text{emit}} = 121.6 \, \text{nm} \):

\[
400 = 121.6 \cdot (1 + z)
\]

\[
1 + z = \frac{400}{121.6} \approx 3.29
\]

\[
z \approx 2.29
\]

Thus, the lower limit on the redshift is approximately \( z \approx 2.29 \). Among the given options, the closest value greater than \( 2.29 \) is \( 2.4 \). Therefore, the lower limit on the redshift for the Lyman alpha line to be detectable in the optical range is \( z = 2.4 \).
