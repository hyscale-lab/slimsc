Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the uncertainty principle. Hmm, I remember that the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle relates the uncertainty in position and momentum of a particle. The question is about finding the minimum uncertainty in energy given the uncertainty in the electron's position.

Wait, the electron is moving at a speed of 2e8 m/s along the x-direction, and the uncertainty in its position is 0.1 nm. Oh wait, wait, no, the problem says the uncertainty in space is Δx=0.1 nm. So I think that's the Δx we'll use.

I think the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle formula is Δx * Δp ≥ ℏ/2, where ℏ is h/(2π), right? So I can use that to find the uncertainty in momentum, Δp. Once I have Δp, I can relate that to the uncertainty in energy since ΔE is related to Δp via the relation E = p²/(2m), perhaps. Or wait, since the electron has kinetic energy, maybe it's just the change in kinetic energy that's relevant here.

Let me jot down what I know:

Δx = 0.1 nm = 0.1e-9 meters. Oh wait, nm is 1e-9 m, so 0.1 nm is 1e-10 meters. Wait wait, no. 0.1 nm is 1e-10 meters? Wait, 1 nm is 1e-9 m, so 0.1 nm is 1e-10 m. Right.

The velocity v is 2e8 m/s. So the momentum p is m*v. Oh wait, but the problem is about Δp, not p. So maybe I should compute Δp using the uncertainty principle.

So, Δx * Δp ≥ ℏ/2. So rearranging, Δp ≥ ℏ/(2Δx).

Plugging in the numbers, ℏ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s. But for calculation, maybe I can approximate it as 1e-34 J·s for simplicity, but I should check the exact value later.

So Δx is 1e-10 m. So,

Δp ≈ (1e-34) / (2 * 1e-10) ) → 1e-34 / 2e-10 = (1/2) * 1e-24 kg·m/s. So that's about 5e-25 kg·m/s. Wait, wait. Let me compute it properly.

Wait, 2Δx is 2*(1e-10) = 2e-10. So ℏ/(2Δx) = (1.0545718e-34) / (2e-10) = approximately 5.27e-25 kg·m/s. So Δp is about 5e-25 kg·m/s. Hmm.

Wait, no, wait: 1e-34 / (2e-10) is (1/2) * 1e-24. Because 1e-
