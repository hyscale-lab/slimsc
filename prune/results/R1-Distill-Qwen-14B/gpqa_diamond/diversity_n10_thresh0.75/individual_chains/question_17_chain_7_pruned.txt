Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, I remember that EDTA forms complexes with metal ions. Oh right, EDTA is a chelating agent, so it binds metal ions like calcium. 

The question says the solution has 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. I think stoichiometric means the ratio is 1:1, like each EDTA binds one Ca²+ ion. Oh wait, the formula for the complex would then be something like CaY²−, where Y is the EDTA part. 

The given K for the complex is 5x10^10, which I believe is the formation constant, Kf. Kf is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. The formula for Kf is [CaY²−]/([Ca²+][EDTA]). 

But wait, in this problem, the solution is already the complex. So all the EDTA is bound to Ca²+, right? Because the complex is 0.02 M. So the total concentration of EDTA and calcium would be the same as the complex concentration? Or wait, no. Because each complex has one Ca and one EDTA. So if the concentration of CaY²− is 0.02 M, then the total EDTA in solution is 0.02 M, and the same goes for calcium, assuming no other sources.

Wait, but the problem is asking for the concentration of calcium ions. So if all the Ca is in the complex, then why would [Ca²+] be anything but almost zero? That can't be right because the K is so large. Oh wait, no. The K is so large that the complex is very stable, so almost all the Ca is in the complex. But wait, the solution is 0.02 M in the complex. So if the complex dissociates a little, but since K is so big, the extent of dissociation would be very small, so [Ca²+] would be low.

Wait, maybe I should set up the equation. The formation reaction is Ca²+ + EDTA^4− ↔ CaEDTA²−. The Kf is [CaEDTA²−]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4−]). 

But in this solution, the concentration of CaEDTA²− is 0.02 M. Let's call the concentration of free Ca²+ as x. The EDTA^4− concentration would then
