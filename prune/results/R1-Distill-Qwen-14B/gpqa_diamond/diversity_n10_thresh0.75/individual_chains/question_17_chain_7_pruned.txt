Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, right? It binds to metal ions like calcium. The question says there's a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Oh wait, stoichiometric probably means that the ratio is 1:1, so each EDTA molecule binds one calcium ion.

The concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M. And the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10. I think the formation constant, K, is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. So the reaction would be something like Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2- with K equal to [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]).

Wait, but in this solution, we have the complex already formed. So the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. At equilibrium, some of it might dissociate into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-.

Let me think about the dissociation. The complex will dissociate a little bit, so we can model it as:

CaEDTA^2- ↔ Ca²+ + EDTA^4- 

The formation constant K is given, which is 5e10. So the dissociation constant, Kd, would be 1/K, which is 1/(5e10) = 2e-11.

Wait, no. K for the formation is the same as the inverse of the dissociation. So yes, if K is 5e10, then Kd is 1/(5e10) = 2e-11.

So the dissociation equation is as above, and Kd is [Ca²+][EDTA^4-]/[CaEDTA^2-] = 2e-11.

Let’s denote the concentration of Ca²+ as x. Since the complex dissociates into one Ca²+ and one EDTA^4-, the concentration of EDTA would also be x. So [Ca²+] = x, [EDTA^4-] = x, and [CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 - x.

But wait, since Kd is so small (2e-11
