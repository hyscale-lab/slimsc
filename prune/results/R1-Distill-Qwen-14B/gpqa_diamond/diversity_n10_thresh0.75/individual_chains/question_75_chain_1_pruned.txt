Okay, let's try to figure this out. So, the question is about a failed experiment in creating a transgenic mouse model. The main issue is that the protein isn't being overexpressed as expected. Let me break down the problem step by step.

The researcher is trying to overexpress the GADD45G protein in mice. They introduced a coding sequence with an influenza hemagglutinin tag at the N-terminus. They transfected the plasmid into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells using Lipofectamine and selected for antibiotic resistance. But when they tested the expression, they couldn't get the protein to overexpress. They looked at the plus strand sequence and found some issue.

Looking at the answer options, I need to figure out what's wrong with the construct based on the provided DNA sequence.

Option A: The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation. The hemagglutinin tag is at the N-terminus. If there's a mutation in the HA sequence, it might affect the protein's function or recognition. But would that prevent expression? Probably not; unless the mutation is in a critical region. But the problem here is that the protein isn't being expressed at all, so maybe this isn't the main issue.

Option B: The ribosome terminated the translation early. Translation termination happens when a stop codon (UAA, UAG, UGA) is encountered. If the construct has an early stop codon, the protein would be truncated, but here the problem is that the protein isn't being expressed as expected. Unless the construct lacks a stop codon, but that's not the case here. Wait, looking at the sequence, I should check for any in-frame stop codons.

Option C: The lack of a linker sequence is causing proteolysis. Proteolysis would degrade the protein after it's made. If there's no linker between the HA tag and the GADD45G, maybe the cell's proteases are cutting the protein. But the issue here is that the protein isn't being expressed, which might mean it's not even being synthesized. So proteolysis would lead to lower levels, but not necessarily no expression. Unless the construct is faulty in a way that the protein isn't made.

Option D: The tRNA for the UAA codon doesn't exist in the mouse. Wait, UAA is a stop codon. In the coding sequence, if there's a UAA in the middle, the ribosome would stop. But wait, in the given construct, is there a UAA codon?

Wait, the given DNA sequence is the coding strand. So the mRNA would be complementary to it. Let me look for UAA in the mRNA. The DNA sequence is 5' to 3'. The mRNA would be complementary and run 5' to 3' as well. So the mRNA would have the same sequence as the coding (plus) strand but with T's replaced by U's.

Looking for any TAA sequences (since mRNA has UAA as stop). Let me scan the DNA sequence for TAA. If any TAA is present in the coding sequence, when transcribed, it would be UAA in mRNA, which is a stop codon.

Looking at the sequence:

I'll go through the sequence looking for TAA.

Looking for 'TAA' in the plus strand (DNA):

Looking at sections:

- starts with ATG TAC CCC ATA CGA TGT TCC AGA TTA ... Wait, there's TTA here. Not TAA.

Looking further, another part: GGAAAGCGCTGCATGAGTTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA

Hmm, I see a 'TGA' in the DNA sequence towards the end. Let me see the exact spot:

GAGTGA is at the end. So in DNA, it's GAG TGA. The mRNA would have UAG UAA. Wait, wait, no. DNA is 5' to 3', so the mRNA is the same as the coding strand but T->U.

So the last part is GAG TGA. So the mRNA would be GAG UAA. So the last codon is UAA.

Wait, no. Let me think. DNA is coding strand, so the mRNA is same as coding, but T's become U's. So the last part is GAGTGA in the DNA, which is the coding strand. So mRNA has GAUUAA?

Wait, no, each triplet is a codon. Let me see:

The DNA ends with ...GAGTGA.

So the mRNA would be ...GAU UAA.

Wait, the last few nucleotides are ...GAG TGA.

Breaking into codons: GAG TGA.

But wait, the mRNA is made from the template strand, which is complementary to the coding (plus) strand. Wait, no! Wait, the coding (plus) strand is the same as mRNA, except T becomes U. So in the coding strand, the last part is GAG TGA. So mRNA is GAG UAA, since T becomes U.

Wait, no, wait: The coding strand is same as mRNA, so the mRNA would have the same
