Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a boson. Let me see if I can figure it out. Hmm, the question gives me a Lagrangian interaction term involving the boson X and fermions. The mass of X is 6 GeV, and I need to find out which decay channels are kinematically allowed at the lowest order.

Wait, the Lagrangian is given as L(y) = -λ f ψ_f(y) (ῡ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, maybe I should parse that more carefully. Oh, right, the interaction term is -λ f ψ_f (ῡ + X) ψ_f. Hmm, no, wait, I think I might have misread that. Let me look again. Oh wait, the actual Lagrangian is written as L(y) = -λ f bar{ψ} f(y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, maybe I'm not interpreting that correctly. Let me think about what this interaction implies.

So, I think the interaction term is something like λ f (ψ_f)^† (v + X) ψ_f. Wait, but in the standard notation, the Yukawa interaction for a scalar boson coupling to fermions would be something like L = g f \overline{\psi} \phi \psi, where phi is the scalar field. So in this case, the boson X is coupling to fermions with a term proportional to f bar{ψ} X ψ, where f is some coupling factor. So this suggests that the boson X can interact with fermions in a Yukawa-like coupling.

Now, for the decay of X, the boson X can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs. The possible decay products depend on the mass of X and the masses of the fermions. So if X's mass is 6 GeV, then the decay products must have a combined mass less than 6 GeV for it to be kinematically allowed.

Wait, but fermions come in different types, each with different masses. So, for example, quarks have different masses depending on their type, and leptons have smaller masses. So I need to list all possible fermion pairs that the X boson can decay into, considering their masses.

Wait, what's the mass of each fermion? Let me recall the approximate masses:

- Up quark (u): about 2.2 MeV
- Down quark (d): about 4.7 MeV
- Strange quark (s): about 95 MeV
- Charm quark (c): about 1.3 GeV
- Bottom quark (b): about 4.5 GeV
- Top quark (t): way heavier, about 173 GeV
- Electron (e): ~0.5 MeV
- Muon (μ): ~105.7 MeV
- Tau (τ): ~1.78 GeV
- Neutrinos: very light, but if the problem considers them, but in the options, I don't see them.

Wait, so the mass of X is 6 GeV. So any fermion pair where each fermion has a mass less than 3 GeV (since each would be produced as a pair, so 2m < M_X). Wait, no, actually, for a decay into two particles, the sum of their rest masses must be less than the mass of the decaying particle. So for a fermion-antifermion pair, each fermion must have a mass m such that 2m < 6 GeV. So m < 3 GeV each.

So which fermions have masses below 3 GeV each?

Let's list all possible fermions that X could decay into:

For quarks:
- u: 2.2 MeV → 2m = 4.4 MeV < 6 GeV → yes
- d: 4.7 MeV → 9.4 MeV < 6 GeV → yes
- s: 95 MeV → 190 MeV < 6 GeV → yes
- c: 1.3 GeV → 2.6 GeV < 6 GeV → yes
- b: 4.5 GeV → 9 GeV > 6 GeV → no, so b and anti-b can't be produced.
- t: way above, so no.

For leptons:
- e: 0.5 MeV → 1 MeV <6 GeV → yes
- μ: 105.7 MeV → 211.4 MeV <6 GeV → yes
- τ: 1.78 GeV → 3.56 GeV <6 GeV → yes. Wait, 3.56 GeV is less than 6 GeV, so τ+τ- is allowed.

Wait, but wait, 1.78 GeV per τ. So two would be about 3.56 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV. So that's allowed. So τ can be produced.

So, possible quark pairs are u, d, s, c. But wait, let's check their masses again.

Wait, for c quark, 1.3 GeV. 2m is 2.6 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV. So c and anti-c can be produced.

The bottom quark is 4.5 GeV each, so 9 GeV total, which is more than 6 GeV. So b and anti-b can't be produced.

So possible quark decays are: u u_bar, d d_bar, s s_bar, c c_bar.

Leptons: e e_bar, μ μ_bar, τ τ_bar.

Wait, but wait, can X decay into a tau pair? Because each tau is about 1.78 GeV, so two would sum to ~3.56 GeV, which is way below 6 GeV. So allowed.

So possible decay channels are:

X → uū, dđ, sī, cī, e+ e−, μ+ μ−, τ+ τ−.

Wait, but looking at the options, let's check each option.

Option A: X→ b b_bar, s s_bar, u u_bar, d d_bar, τ+τ−, e+e−. 

Wait, but wait, option A includes b b_bar. But as I thought, X's mass is 6 GeV, and each b quark is 4.5 GeV. 2 *4.5=9 GeV >6 GeV. So decay into b b_bar is not allowed. So option A is incorrect.

Option B: X→ c c_bar, s s_bar, u u_bar, d d_bar, τ+τ−, μ+μ−, e+e−. 

So this includes c c_bar, which is allowed (2*1.3=2.6 GeV <6 GeV), and also τ and μ. So this option looks correct so far. Let's see the masses.

Yes, fermion pairs in option B are all less than 3 GeV each, so allowed.

Option C: X→ c c_bar, s s_bar, u u_bar, d d_bar, t t_bar, τ+τ−, μ+μ−,e+e−.

Wait, t quark is about 173 GeV each. 2 *173 = 346 GeV >>6 GeV. So decay into t t_bar is impossible. So option C is incorrect.

Option D: X→b b_bar, s s_bar, u u_bar, d d_bar, τ+τ−, μ+μ−,e+e−.

Again, same as option A, includes b, which isn't allowed. So option D is incorrect.

So the correct option is B, which includes c, s, u, d, τ, μ, e pairs. Let me check the option B again.

Option B: X → c c_bar, s s_bar, u u_bar, d d_bar, τ+τ−, μ+μ−, e+e−.

Yes, all of these have fermion masses under 3 GeV each. So their decay is allowed.

Wait, but wait another thing. The coupling term in the Lagrangian: the interaction is given as -λ f bar{ψ} f(y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). So perhaps the f(y) is a scalar field, and the interaction is between X and the fermions ψ_f. So that would imply that the coupling is to the fermions ψ_f, which could be any fermion species. So the decay would be into any fermion-antifermion pair, provided their combined mass is less than 6 GeV.

Wait, but in the Lagrangian, f is a coupling constant, perhaps, and ψ_f is the fermion field. So the interaction term would allow X to decay into any fermion pair, as long as phase space allows. So the only constraint is the mass.

So yeah, the possible decay products are all fermion pairs where each has mass less than 3 GeV.

So in terms of the options:

Option B says X can decay into c c_bar, s s_bar, u u_bar, d d_bar, τ+τ−, μ+μ−, e+e−.

So each of those fermions has a mass below 3 GeV, so they are allowed.

So the answer should be option B.


The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decays of a boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV, based on the interaction term in the Lagrangian:

\[
\mathcal{L}(y) = -\lambda f \bar{\psi}_f(y) \left(\upsilon + X(y)\right) \psi_f(y).
\]

The interaction implies that \( X \) can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs, provided the total mass of the decay products is less than the mass of \( X \), i.e., \( 2m_f < 6 \, \text{GeV} \), where \( m_f \) is the mass of each fermion in the pair.
