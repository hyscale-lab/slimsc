Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think through it step by step.

The question is asking for the mean decay distance of a meson X. The given parameters are the production energy E_X =8 GeV, mass m_X=1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X=320 MeV. The options are all in the order of 10^-15 or 10^-16 meters, so it's something really tiny.

Wait, I remember that the mean decay distance is related to the lifetime of the particle and its velocity. Oh right, the formula I think is something like c multiplied by the lifetime (τ), and then multiplied by the velocity (βc) because distance is velocity times time. So the mean decay length L should be βγ c τ. Oh wait, but sometimes it's written as L = c τ β γ. Or is it β times gamma times c times tau? Yeah, I think that's right.

But wait, how do I find the lifetime τ? Oh, right, the width Γ is related to the lifetime via the uncertainty principle. Γ is the total decay width, and the lifetime τ is inversely proportional to Γ. The exact relation is τ = ħ / Γ. But wait, units might be tricky here. Let me think: Γ has units of energy, and ħ in units of GeV·s. So I need to calculate τ in seconds first.

Wait, actually, I might have gotten the formula wrong. Let me make sure. The decay width Γ is related to the mean lifetime τ by the equation Γ = ħ / τ. So τ = ħ / Γ. But wait no, wait, I think the correct formula is Γ = ħ * τ^-1. So Γ is the inverse of τ multiplied by ħ. So yeah, τ = ħ / Γ. But wait, wait, no wait, I think it's Γ = ħ * (1/τ). So τ = ħ/(Γ). Yeah, that makes sense.

But wait, the units. Because ħ is in J·s, but if Γ is given in GeV, I need to convert everything into compatible units. Alternatively, I can use the natural units where c=1 and ħ=197.3 MeV·fm or something like that. Wait, 197.3 MeV·fm is approximately ħc. Because ħ is about 6.582×10^-25 GeV·s, but maybe it's easier to use units where c=1 and ħ is in GeV·s.

Wait, maybe I can calculate the lifetime using the relation τ = ħ / Γ. But then I need to make sure all the units are correct. Let me think: ħ is approximately 6.582×10^-25 GeV·s. Γ is given as 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV.

So τ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) = (6.582e-25 / 0.32) s. Let me compute that: 6.582 divided by 0.32 is approximately 20.56875, so 20.56875e-25 s. Which is 2.056875e-24 seconds? Wait, wait, 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32 is 20.56875e-25? Because 6.582 / 0.32 = approx 20.56875. So 20.56875e-25 s is 2.056875e-24 s.

Wait, no, because 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32 is (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25. So 6.582 / 0.32 is about 20.56875, so 20.56875e-25 s is 2.056875e-24 s.

Wait, but wait a second, that seems really short, but maybe that's right. So then the lifetime is τ ≈ 2.057e-24 seconds. But wait, is that correct? Because I'm getting confused with the exponents.

Wait, 6.582e-25 GeV s divided by 0.32 GeV gives (6.582e-25 /0.32) s. Let's compute that: 6.582 / 0.32 is about 20.56875. So 20.56875e-25 s = 2.056875e-24 seconds. That's correct.

Now, the next step is to find the velocity β of the meson. Because the decay length depends on velocity. But how do I find β?

The meson is produced with energy E_X =8 GeV, mass m_X=1.2 GeV. So I can find the Lorentz factor gamma using E = gamma m c². Since we're in natural units where c=1, E = gamma m.

So gamma = E / m = 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 8 / 1.2 = 6.666... ≈ 6.6667.

Then, gamma is 6.6667. Then, using the relation gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - β²), I can solve for β.

So 1/gamma = sqrt(1 - β²). So 1/(gamma²) = 1 - β². Therefore, β² = 1 - 1/(gamma²).

Gamma is 6.6667, so gamma squared is (20/3)^2 = 400/9 ≈44.4444. So 1/gamma squared is 9/400 = 0.0225.

So β² = 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. Therefore, β = sqrt(0.9775) ≈ sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887. So about 0.9887 c.

Wait, let me compute that more accurately. 0.9775 is under the square root. Let me see: 0.98^2 is 0.9604, 0.988^2 is (0.98 +0.008)^2 ≈ 0.9604 + 2*(0.98)(0.008) + 0.008^2 = 0.9604 + 0.01568 + 0.000064 = 0.976144. Hmm, that's less than 0.9775. Let's try 0.9887^2: (0.9887)^2 = let's compute it.

0.9887 * 0.9887:

First compute 9887 * 9887. Let me think alternatively: 0.9887 = 1 - 0.0113. So (1 - x)^2 = 1 -2x +x². x=0.0113. So 1-0.0226 + (0.0113)^2 ≈ 0.9774 + 0.00012769 ≈ 0.9775277. That's very close to 0.9775. So sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887. So β≈0.9887.

So the velocity is about 0.9887c.

Now, the mean decay length L is given by L = β γ c τ.

Wait, let me write it correctly. The decay length is L = v * τ' where τ' is the proper lifetime and v is the velocity. But when the particle is moving, the lifetime is dilated, so τ = gamma tau_0. Wait, no, the proper lifetime is tau_0, and the observed lifetime is gamma tau_0. So the distance is v * gamma tau_0.

Wait, perhaps the formula I remember is L = β c tau. Wait, no. Let me get this straight.

The lifetime of the particle in the lab frame is gamma tau_0, where tau_0 is the proper lifetime (the lifetime in the rest frame). So the distance the particle travels before decaying is v multiplied by the lab frame lifetime. v is beta c.

So L = beta c * gamma tau_0. Since tau_0 is the proper lifetime, which is tau_0 = hbar / m_X width? Wait no, earlier I thought that tau is hbar / Gamma. But wait, in the rest frame, the width is Gamma. So the proper lifetime is tau_0 = hbar / Gamma.

Wait, wait, no. The decay width Gamma is the same in all frames, right? Because it's a property of the particle. So the proper lifetime is tau_0 = ħ / Gamma. Because in the rest frame, the decay width is Gamma, and the lifetime is tau_0 = ħ / Gamma.

Wait, but earlier I thought tau = ħ / Gamma, but that can't be right if tau is the lab frame lifetime. So maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let's think again.

The total decay width Gamma is related to the mean lifetime tau_0 (proper time) by Gamma = ħ / tau_0.

So, tau_0 = ħ / Gamma.

Then, the lab frame lifetime is tau = gamma tau_0. So tau = gamma * (ħ / Gamma).

Therefore, the decay length L is beta c tau = beta c gamma tau_0.

So putting it all together: L = beta c gamma (hbar / Gamma).

Wait, let me see: L = beta * c * tau.

But tau is gamma tau_0, and tau_0 is hbar / Gamma.

So: L = beta c (gamma (hbar / Gamma)).

Wait, but I'm getting confused with units. Let me try to plug in the numbers, making sure everything is in compatible units.

Let me compute each part step by step.

First, compute tau_0 = hbar / Gamma.

hbar is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s.

Gamma is given as 320 MeV = 0.32 GeV.

So tau_0 = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) = (6.582 / 0.32) × 1e-25 s ≈ 20.56875e-25 s = 2.056875e-24 s.

Then, gamma is 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 6.666667.

So tau = gamma * tau_0 = 6.666667 * 2.056875e-24 s ≈ 1.371e-23 s.

Then, the velocity beta is approx 0.9887 as computed earlier.

So L = beta * c * tau.

c is approximately 3e8 m/s.

So L = 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s * 1.371e-23 s.

Let's compute that:

0.9887 * 3e8 = approx 2.966e8 m/s.

Multiply by 1.371e-23 s: 2.966e8 * 1.371e-23 = (2.966 * 1.371) * 1e-15.

2.966 * 1.371 = Let me compute that.

2 * 1.371 = 2.742.

0.966 * 1.371: Let's compute 0.966 * 1 = 0.966; 0.966 * 0.371 ≈ 0.358. So total is 0.966 + 0.358 ≈ 1.324. So 2.742 + 1.324 ≈ 4.066.

So 4.066e-15 meters.

Wait, but let me compute it more accurately.

Wait, 2.966e8 * 1.371e-23 = (2.966 * 1.371) * 1e-15.

Compute 2.966 * 1.371:

2.966 * 1 = 2.966

2.966 * 0.3 = 0.8898

2.966 * 0.07 = 0.20762

2.966 * 0.001 = 0.002966

Adding them up: 2.966 + 0.8898 = 3.8558; +0.20762 = 4.06342; +0.002966 ≈4.066386.

So approximately 4.066e-15 meters.

Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, which is very close. Option C is 5.0223e-15 m. Hmm, so why is there a discrepancy between our calculation and the options? Oh, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, wait, perhaps I should compute it more accurately. Let me recompute 2.966e8 * 1.371e-23.

Wait, but perhaps I should go back and see if I made any mistake in the approach.

Wait another thought: Maybe I should calculate L as (hbar c) * (β gamma) / Gamma.

Because another way to write L is (hbar c beta gamma) / Gamma.

Since L = beta c tau, and tau = gamma tau_0, tau_0 = hbar / Gamma.

So L = beta c gamma (hbar / Gamma) = (beta gamma) (hbar c) / Gamma.

This might be easier because I can compute hbar c in units of GeV·fm or something.

Wait, I remember that hbar c is approximately 197.33 MeV·fm. Which is 0.19733 GeV·fm.

So let me plug that into the formula.

L = (beta gamma) * (hbar c) / Gamma.

Gamma is 0.32 GeV.

So:

beta gamma = 0.9887 * 6.666667 ≈ around 6.611.

Then, (6.611) * (0.19733 GeV·fm) / (0.32 GeV) = (6.611 * 0.19733) / 0.32 fm.

Compute numerator: 6.611 * 0.19733 ≈ 6.611 * 0.2 is 1.3222, but 0.19733 is a bit less, so 6.611 * 0.19733 ≈ approx 1.31.

Wait, let's compute it more accurately.

6.611 * 0.19733:

= (6 * 0.19733) + (0.611 * 0.19733)

= 1.18398 + (0.611 * 0.19733)

Compute 0.611 * 0.19733:

0.6 * 0.19733 = 0.1184

0.011 * 0.19733 ≈ 0.00217

So total ≈ 0.1184 + 0.00217 = 0.12057.

So total is 1.18398 + 0.12057 = 1.30455.

So numerator is 1.30455.

Divide by 0.32: 1.30455 / 0.32 ≈ 4.0767.

So L ≈ 4.0767 fm.

Wait, 1 fm is 1e-15 meters, so 4.0767 fm is 4.0767e-15 m.

Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, and option C is 5.02e-15. Hmm, so our first calculation gave ~4.066e-15, and this one is ~4.077e-15. Close to option B.

Wait, but why the slight discrepancy? Maybe due to more precise calculation of beta and gamma.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation in beta or gamma.

Wait, let's double-check the calculation of beta.

Gamma was 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 6.666... So that's correct.

Then, gamma = 6.666667.

Then, beta = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)) = sqrt(1 - (1/( (20/3)^2 )) ) = sqrt(1 - 9/400 ) = sqrt(391/400) = sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887.

Wait, wait, 391/400 is 0.9775 exactly.

So sqrt(0.9775) is approximately 0.9887.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps using more precise calculation for beta:

Let me compute sqrt(0.9775) with more precision.

Let me see, 0.9887^2 = 0.97752769, which is a bit more than 0.9775.

So sqrt(0.9775) is just a bit less than 0.9887, perhaps around 0.9886 or 0.98865.

So let's say beta is 0.98865.

Then, beta gamma = 0.98865 * 6.666667 ≈ ?

Compute 0.98865 *6.666667:

= 0.98865 * (20/3) ) ≈ 0.98865 *6.666667.

Let me compute it:

0.98865 *6 = 5.9319

0.98865 *0.666667 ≈ 0.98865 * (2/3) ≈ 0.6591.

So total approx 5.9319 + 0.6591 = 6.591.

So beta gamma ≈6.591.

Then, using the formula:

L = (beta gamma) * (hbar c) / Gamma.

hbar c is 0.19733 GeV·fm.

Gamma is 0.32 GeV.

So:

(6.591) * (0.19733 GeV·fm) / (0.32 GeV) = (6.591 * 0.19733) / 0.32 fm.

Compute numerator: 6.591 * 0.19733 ≈ Let's compute:

6 *0.19733=1.18398

0.591 *0.19733≈0.11707.

Total: 1.18398 +0.11707=1.30105.

Divide by 0.32: 1.30105 / 0.32 ≈4.06578 fm.

Which is 4.06578e-15 meters.

So that's approximately 4.0658e-15 m.

Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, which is almost exactly this value. So the correct answer must be option B.


To determine the mean decay distance \( L \) of the meson resonance \( X \), we use the formula:

\[
L = \frac{\beta \gamma \hbar c}{\Gamma}
\]

### Step 1: Compute the Lorentz factor \( \gamma \)
The energy of the meson is \( E_X = 8 \, \text{GeV} \), and its mass is \( m_X = 1.2 \, \text{GeV} \). Using the relation \( \gamma = \frac{E}{m} \):

\[
\gamma = \frac{8}{1.2} \approx 6.6667
\]

### Step 2: Compute the velocity \( \beta \)
The relation between \( \gamma \) and \( \beta \) is:

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \beta^2}}
\]

Rearranging for \( \beta^2 \):

\[
\beta^2 = 1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}
\]

Substituting \( \gamma = 6.6667 \):

\[
\beta^2 = 1 - \frac{1}{(6.6667)^2} = 1 - \frac{1}{44.4444} \approx 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775
\]

Thus:

\[
\beta = \sqrt{0.9775} \approx 0.9887
\]

### Step 3: Compute \( \beta \gamma \)
Using \( \beta \approx 0.9887 \) and \( \gamma \approx 6.6667 \):

\[
\beta \gamma = 0.9887 \times 6.6667 \approx 6.591
\]

### Step 4: Use the formula for \( L \)
The reduced Planck constant \( \hbar c \) is approximately \( 0.19733 \, \text{GeV·fm} \), and the decay width \( \Gamma = 320 \, \text{MeV} = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \). Substituting into the formula:

\[
L = \frac{\beta \gamma \hbar c}{\Gamma}
\]

\[
L = \frac{6.591 \times 0.19733}{0.32} \, \text{fm}
\]

First, compute the numerator:

\[
6.591 \times 0.19733 \approx 1.30105
\]

Then, divide by \( 0.32 \):

\[
L = \frac{1.30105}{0.32} \approx 4.0658 \, \text{fm}
\]

Convert to meters:

\[
L = 4.0658 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}
\]

### Step 5: Match with the options
The closest option to \( 4.0658 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \) is:

**B) \( 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \)**

### Final Answer:
**Answer: B**
