Okay, I've got this physics question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Hmm, I remember that SMEFT is an effective theory that incorporates all possible higher-dimensional operators respecting certain symmetries. But wait, what are those symmetries again?

The question asks which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are 1, 2, 3, 4. Let me think about each symmetry.

First, Lorentz symmetry. Oh right, because SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory. All terms must respect special relativity, so operators should be Lorentz scalars. So Lorentz symmetry is definitely one of them. So option 1 is correct.

Next, Poincare symmetry. Wait, Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz transformations plus translations. So it's a bigger symmetry group than just Lorentz. SMEFT operators must transform correctly under Lorentz, but do they have to respect all of Poincare? I'm a bit fuzzy here. I think that since SMEFT is a field theory, it's formulated in a way that respects Poincare symmetry. Because the underlying SM does, and SMEFT is an effective theory built on that. So operators should be Poincare-invariant. So option 2 would also have to be correct. So both 1 and 2 are correct so far.

Then, CP symmetry. SMEFT operators might violate CP, right? Like, the SM has some CP violation (like in the CKM matrix), and SMEFT includes higher-dimensional operators that can have terms which break CP. So the operators don't necessarily have to respect CP symmetry. So option 3 is not a must; thus, it's not correct for all operators.

What about CPT symmetry? Hmm. CPT is a big one. I remember that in quantum field theory, all interactions must respect CPT symmetry because of the way the theory is constructed. So operators in SMEFT must be CPT-invariant. So option 4 (CPT) is correct.

Wait, wait. Let me reevaluate. So the four options are 1,2,3,4. The question is which must be respected by all operators.

So which of these are required? Lorentz (1) and Poincare (2) are both about spacetime symmetries. But wait, Poincare is a bigger symmetry. Do SMEFT operators have to respect Poincare
