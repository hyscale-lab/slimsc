Okay, let's try to tackle this astronomy problem. Hmm, I remember it's about stars and their effective temperature. So, the question is about a star with some spots and how that affects the ratio of neutral Titanium atoms in two energy levels.

The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and 1.1 solar masses, but I don't think those details are directly relevant here. When the star's surface isn't covered by spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Wait, why does that happen? Oh, because the spots are cooler than the surrounding photosphere, so they lower the average temperature.

The part that's confusing is the ratio of Ti atoms in two energy levels. So, the ratio N1/N2 decreases when the star has spots. They want to find the factor by which this ratio changes. So, when there are no spots, it's higher than when there are spots, and the factor is (N1/N2) no spots divided by (N1/N2) with spots.

I think I should recall the Boltzmann equation, which relates the population of atoms in different energy levels to temperature. The Boltzmann factor is (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2-E1)/(k*T) ). The ratio N1/N2 is (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k*T) ), right? Because N1/N2 = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E1-E2)/(k T) ) ) which is same as (g1/g2) exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) ) if E2 > E1.

Wait, let me think again. The Boltzmann distribution is N_i/N_j = (g_i/g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) ). So if level 1 is lower than level 2, then E2 > E1. So N1/N2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) )^{-1} )? No, wait, wait. Wait, N_i is proportional to g_i * exp( -E_i/(k T) ). So N1/N2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) ). So, if E2 > E1, then the exponential is positive. So higher T would make the exponential term larger, right?

But in this problem, when the star has spots, the overall Teff is lower. So the temperature T is lower when spots are present.

So the ratio N1/N2 depends on T. Since the spots cause T to decrease, how does that affect the ratio?

Wait, the problem says that when the star has spots, the observed ratio decreases. So when spots are present, N1/N2 is lower than when they aren't. That implies that when T decreases, the ratio N1/N2 decreases. So let's see: N1/N2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) )^{-1} )? Wait, no, earlier I thought N1/N2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) ), but maybe I should get this right.

Wait, let me write the formula. The Boltzmann distribution says:

N_i = (g_i / Q) * exp( - E_i / (k T) )

Where Q is the partition function. So the ratio N1/N2 is (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

Because N1/N2 = [ (g1 exp(-E1/(k T)) ) / (g2 exp(-E2/(k T)) ) ) ] = (g1/g2) exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) )

So if E2 > E1, then (E2-E1) is positive. So when T increases, exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) ) increases? No, wait, let me think. (E2-E1) is positive. So as T increases, (E2-E1)/(k T) decreases. So the exponent is smaller, so exp( a smaller positive number ) is larger than exp( a larger positive number), but wait, if T is larger, (E2-E1)/(k T) is smaller. So the exponential term is larger when T is smaller? Wait, no.

Wait, let's take a number. Suppose (E2-E1)/k is 1000 K. So for T=5000 K, the exponent is 1000 / (5000) = 0.2. So exp(0.2) is about 1.2214.

If T increases to 6000 K, then the exponent is 1000/6000 â‰ˆ
