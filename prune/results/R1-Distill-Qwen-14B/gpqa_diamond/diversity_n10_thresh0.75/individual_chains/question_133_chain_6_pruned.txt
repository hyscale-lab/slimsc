Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution. Hmm, I remember that orthophosphate is HPO4^3- or PO4^3-, right? Wait, no, wait. H3PO4 is the phosphoric acid. The first deprotonation gives H2PO4^- (Ka1), the second gives HPO4^2- (Ka2), and the third gives PO4^3- (Ka3). Oh wait, but the question is about orthophosphate ions, which I think is HPO4^2-.

The solution contains two substances: KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4Â·2H2O. So each of them contributes to the amounts of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- in solution, right?

The problem statement says that each is 1.00 grams. So I'll need to find the moles of each compound, then figure out the concentrations.

First, let's compute the moles for each.

The molecular weight (Mw) of KH2PO4 is 136.09 g/mol. So moles = mass / Mw. 1.00g / 136.09 g/mol = approximately 0.007335 mol. Let me compute that more accurately: 1/136.09 is about 0.007335, so yeah, 0.007335 moles.

Next, the Na2H
