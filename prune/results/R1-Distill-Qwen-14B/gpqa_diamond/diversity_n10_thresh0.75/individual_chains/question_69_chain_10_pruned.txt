Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me about particle decay in a bubble chamber. Hmm, let's see. The question says that a particle X⁰ decays into Y⁺ and Z⁻, and its proper lifetime is τ₀ = 8e-16 seconds. They want to find the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. The setup is in the CERN Bubble Chamber with an energy of 27 GeV, and the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV.

Wait, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I remember that the proper lifetime is the lifetime measured in the rest frame of the particle. But when the particle is moving, we have to account for time dilation due to relativity. Right, so the observed lifetime τ is longer than τ₀ by a factor of gamma (γ), which is the Lorentz factor.

Gamma is given by γ = E/(m c²). Oh wait, the energy E is given as 27 GeV, and the mass m is 3.41 GeV. So let me calculate gamma first.

E = 27 GeV, m c² = 3.41 GeV. So gamma = 27 / 3.41. Let me compute that: 27 divided by 3.41. Hmm. Let me see, 3.41 times 7 is about 23.87, and 3.41 times 7.9 is 27? Let me calculate 3.41 * 7.9.

3.41 *7 =23.87, 3.41 *0.9=3.069. So total is 23.87 +3.069=26.939, which is about 26.94. So 7.9 would give me 26.94, which is just under 27. So gamma is approximately 7.91 or so. Let me just compute 27 /3.41 exactly. 3.41 *7.9=26.939, so 27-26.939=0.061. So 0.061 /3.41=approx 0.0179. So gamma ≈7.9179. So about 7.918.

So the lifetime observed τ is gamma times τ₀. So τ = gamma * τ₀ = 7.918 * 8e-16 s. Let's compute that. 7.918 *8 is approx 63.344, so τ ≈63.344e-16 s. Which is 6.3344e-15 seconds.

Now, the next part is about the decay length. The decay length is how far the particle travels before decaying, right? So the distance is velocity multiplied by the lifetime. So L = v * τ.

But wait, to find v, I can compute it from the energy E. Because E² = (pc)
