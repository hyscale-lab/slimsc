Okay, so I have this problem about a rhombohedral crystal, and I need to find the interplanar distance of the (111) plane. Hmm, I remember that interplanar distance is related to the crystal structure and the lattice parameters. Let's see, what do I know about rhombohedral crystals?

Rhombohedral crystals have a specific type of lattice called the rhombohedral lattice, which is a special case of both the cubic and hexagonal systems. But wait, in this case, all the angles α, β, γ are 30 degrees. Oh right, so it's a rhombohedral lattice with all angles equal, which I think is sometimes called a trigonal lattice. But I'm not sure if that affects the calculation.

The interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstroms. Wait, in a rhombohedral structure, each lattice parameter 'a' would be the edge length. So is the interatomic distance the same as 'a' here? I think so, because in a simple cubic structure, the interatomic distance is the same as the lattice parameter. So probably, a = 10 Ang.

The question is about the (111) plane. I recall that the interplanar distance d(hkl) for a crystal is given by the formula involving the reciprocal of the lattice parameters and the Miller indices. Oh right, the formula is:

1/d² = (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) * (1 - 2cos α (cos β cos γ) + ... wait, no, maybe I
