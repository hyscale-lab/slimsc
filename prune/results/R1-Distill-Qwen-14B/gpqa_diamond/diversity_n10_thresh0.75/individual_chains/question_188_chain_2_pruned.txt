Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, specifically about a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, I remember that in crystals, the interplanar distance is important for things like X-ray diffraction. The question gives me the interatomic distance, but wait, interatomic distance usually refers to the distance between adjacent atoms along a bond, right? But in a crystal structure, especially a unit cell, the lattice parameters are usually given as a, b, c. Oh wait, wait, in a rhombohedral system, the lattice parameters a, b, and c are all equal because it's a special case. So a = b = c, right?

The angles alpha, beta, gamma are all 30 degrees each. I think in a rhombohedral system, all three angles are equal, yeah. So that's the case here.

The question is about the interplanar distance of the (111) plane. Oh right, the interplanar distance is the distance between two adjacent planes in the crystal lattice. The formula for calculating this is d = (a) / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk cos alpha + hl cos beta + kl cos gamma) ) ), but wait I'm a bit confused about the exact formula. Alternatively, I think another form might be d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2(hk cos gamma_h + hk cos gamma_k + ... )) ) Wait, no, perhaps the formula is more precise when considering the specific angles in the structure.

Wait, maybe I should think about the general formula for interplanar distance in a crystal. The general formula is d = (1/√( (h/a)^2 + (k/b)^2 + (l/c)^2 - 2(hk cos gamma)/(ab) - 2(hl cos beta)/(ac) - 2(kl cos alpha)/(bc) )) )^{-1}.

But wait, no, that's not precisely correct. I think the correct formula is d = 1 / sqrt( (h²/a²) + (k²/b²) + (l²/c²) + 2(hk cos gamma)/(a^2) + 2(hl cos beta)/(a^2) + 2(kl cos alpha)/(a^2) )) ), but I'm getting a bit mixed up here. Wait, maybe it's better to look at the specific case for a rhombohedral system.
