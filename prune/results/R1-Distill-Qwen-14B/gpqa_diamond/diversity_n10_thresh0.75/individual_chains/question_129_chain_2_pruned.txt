Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to figure it out step by step. The question is about identifying compound E in a series of reactions starting from compound A. Let me read through the problem again carefully.

The reaction steps are:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to produce compound B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 and Pd to form compound C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 to form D.
4. Compound D undergoes elimination of an inert gas to form E.

There are also some hints given:

a) Compound A, when reacted with an unknown phosphorous ylide, forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane.

b) The IR spectrum of A has a strong peak around 1750 cm^-1, while E's IR has a strong peak around 1715 cm^-1.

The options for E are four different cyclic ketones.

Hmm. Let's break this down.

First, let's think about each step.

Step 1: A + HCN â†’ B.

HCN typically adds to carbonyl groups. So if A has a carbonyl (like a ketone or aldehyde), adding HCN would form a cyanohydrin. But wait, HCN can also undergo other reactions. Alternatively, if A is an aldehyde, HCN would form a cyanohydrin. But considering the hints, let's look at hint a.

Hint a says that A reacts with a phosphorous ylide to form 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Phosphorous ylides are typically used in Wittig reactions, which form alkenes by reacting with aldehydes or ketones. So A must have a carbonyl group because the Wittig reaction requires that.

So the product of the Wittig reaction, 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane, implies that the starting carbonyl in A is cyclopentyl something. Let me think about that structure.

The product has a cyclopentane ring. At position 4, there's a propan-2-ylidene group, which is a substituted double bond. Wait, the structure is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. So, perhaps the Wittig reaction added a new substituent to the cyclopentane.

Wait, no. The Wittig reagent (ylide) typically reacts with a carbonyl group (like RCO-R') to form an alkene. So if the product is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane, that suggests that the initial compound A is a cyclopentanone derivative.

Wait, cyclopentanone is a 5-membered ring with a ketone. But in this case, the product from the Wittig has a substituent at position 4. Let me visualize this. The cyclopentane ring has substituents at positions 1 and 2 (two methyl groups) and at position 4, a propan-2-ylidene group. Propan-2-ylidene is CH2-C(CH3)=. Wait, no. Propan-2-ylidene is (CH3)2C= (I think). So the substituent is a methylene group attached to a (CH3)2C- group.

Wait, but in the product, it's (propan-2-ylidene), which is the ylidene group. So in the Wittig reaction, the ylide would have a CH2 group attached to the cyclopentane. Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again.

The Wittig reaction mechanism: the ylide (like Ph3P=CHR) reacts with a carbonyl (RCOR') to form an alkene (RCR'CH2R'') and triphenylphosphine oxide.

So in this case,
