Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me. It's about selecting the right reagents for two reactions. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to form 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? So, it's a ketone. Adding NaCN... Oh wait, I remember that when a ketone reacts with a cyanide, it's usually a nucleophilic addition. But wait, NaCN is a source of CN- ions. So in a ketone, the carbonyl group is attacked by the cyanide. But wait, the product here is a hydroxy nitrile. Hmm.

Wait, but usually when you add CN- to a ketone, you get a cyanohydrin. A cyanohydrin is formed by the addition of a cyanide ion to a carbonyl group, which then gets protonated. So butan-2-one would add CN- to the carbonyl, forming (CH3)2C(OH)CN. Let me see the product given: 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The structure would be (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? Wait, no. Wait, butanenitrile is four carbons, but the starting material is butan-2-one, which is (CH3)2CO. Oh wait, the product's name is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So the structure would be CH2(C)(OH)CH2CN? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here.

Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. So when CN- adds, the product would be (CH3)2C(OH)CN. Wait, but wait, butanenitrile would be CH2CH2CN? No, butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN? No, wait, butane is four carbons, so butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CH2CN? No, but the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me count the carbons. Butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN? Wait, perhaps the structure is (CH3)2CHCN, but with an OH on the same carbon as the CN? Hmm.

Wait, maybe I got the first reaction wrong. Let me think again. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. When it reacts with NaCN, which is a strong nucleophile, it would add to the carbonyl, forming a cyanohydrin. The mechanism is that the CN- attacks the carbonyl carbon, then the oxygen becomes O-, which gets protonated. So the product would be (CH3)2C(OH)CN. So the product is (CH3)2C(OH)-CN. So that's 2-hydroxy-2-methylpropanenitrile? Wait, but the product given is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating the carbons.

Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, which is three carbons (two methyl groups on the central carbon, which is the carbonyl). Adding CN would make it four carbons? Or maybe I'm misunderstanding the product. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. That would have four carbons in the nitrile chain. Let me see: butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN? Wait, maybe it's CH3CH2CH2CN. Wait, no, butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CH2CN? No, that would be pentanenitrile. Wait, butane is four carbons. So butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN? No, wait, the nitrile group is -CN. So butanenitrile is NC-CH2CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, no.
