Okay, so I have this question about which planet is more likely to transit, and I want to figure out the right answer. Let me read through the details carefully.

So, there are two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have the same mass, but Planet_1 has an orbital period three times shorter than Planet_2. Their orbits are circular. The host stars have the same radius, but Planet_1's star is twice as massive as Planet_2's. The researchers want to observe the one with the highest transit probability.

Hmm, transit probability depends on a few factors. From what I remember, the probability is higher when the planet's orbital plane is aligned edge-on with our line of sight. But since they can't know that in advance, the probability also depends on the planet's orbital distance and the star's size. Oh wait, the probability of a transit is given by the formula P = (R_star + R_planet) / a, but I think R_planet is negligible compared to R_star and a, so it's roughly P ≈ R_star / a. Or wait, no, the formula is more like (R_star / a) multiplied by something else? Or maybe the transit probability is P = (R_star / a) * (something)?

Wait, no, I think the formula for the probability that a planet will transit is approximately (R_star / a) multiplied by the fraction of orbits that are edge-on. But actually, more accurately, the probability is the ratio of the star's radius plus the planet's radius to the semi-major axis. But wait, the planet's radius is much smaller than the star's, so it's usually approximated as R_star / a. But also, the inclination plays a role. The probability is the fraction of the possible orbital planes that would result in a transit, which is (R_star + R_planet) / (a * sqrt(1 - e²)), but since the orbits are circular, e=0. So it simplifies to (R_star + R_planet)/(a). Since R_planet is much smaller than R_star, we can ignore it, so P ≈ R_star / a.

Wait, but wait, another factor is the relative size of the planet's orbit. Oh no, wait, no, that's the transit depth, which is (R_planet / R_star)^2. The probability of transit is more about whether the orbital plane's inclination causes the planet to
