Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it carefully.

The question says: I have a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound with 8 carbons in total. The FTIR shows a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond. I need to pick the correct 1H NMR data from the options given.

Hmm, di-substituted aromatic ring means there are two substituents on the benzene ring. The ring itself has 6 carbons, but the total is 8, so the substituents must add 2 carbons. Wait, because 6 (ring) + substituents = 8. So substituents add 2 carbons. So each substituent must contribute one carbon, or maybe a substituent is a group with two carbons.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. So the benzene ring is 6 carbons, and two substituents. Each substituent is attached to the ring. The total carbons are 8, so the substituents add 2 carbons. So each substituent must have one carbon? Or maybe one substituent is two carbons and the other is zero? No, since it's di-substituted, two substituents.

Wait, perhaps one substituent is a carbonyl group, like a ketone, and the other is a halogen. Because IR shows a carbonyl (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond (like -X, where X is Cl, Br, etc.)

Wait, but wait, the IR has both. So the substituents are a carbonyl-containing group and a halogen. So the ring has two substituents: one -X and one carbonyl group. But wait, the substituents can't be just X and O, because O would need to be part of a group. For example, perhaps one substituent is a carbonyl group, like a ketone (C=O), and the other is a halogen, like Cl.

But wait, a substituent can't be just an O, it must be part of a group. So maybe it's a carbonyl group and a halogen. So for example, a benzene ring with a Cl and a carbonyl group attached.

Wait, but how do substituents add up
