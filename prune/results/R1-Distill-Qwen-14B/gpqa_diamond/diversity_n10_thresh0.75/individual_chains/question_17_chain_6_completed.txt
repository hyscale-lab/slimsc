Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, let's see what it's about. The question says there's a solution containing 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. The formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10. The options are A to D, and I need to find which one is the correct concentration of calcium ions.

Wait, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent. It forms complexes with metal ions like calcium. The formation constant, or stability constant, tells us how stable the complex is. A high K means the complex is more stable, so the metal ions are tightly bound.

So the formula for the formation constant is K = [Ca-EDTA]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]). But wait, in solution, EDTA is usually in different protonated forms because it's a polyprotic acid. Oh, but the problem states that the pH is ideal. Oh right! At the ideal pH, EDTA exists predominantly as the Y^4- form. So I don't have to worry about the other protonated forms here. That simplifies things a lot.

The complex is Ca-EDTA, so the equation is Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-. The K here is given as 5e10. So the problem is about dissociation of this complex.

The initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Let me denote the concentration of Ca²+ as x. Then, the concentration of EDTA^4- would also be x because for each CaEDTA complex that dissociates, one Ca²+ and one EDTA^4- are released. But wait, the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, so if it dissociates, the change would be -x for the complex and +x each for Ca²+ and EDTA.

So the expression for K is K = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x). Wait, no, wait. Wait, no. Wait, the complex is 0.02 M, so when it dissociates, let's say it dissociates by x. So [Ca²+] = x, [EDTA^4-] = x, and [CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 - x.

So K = (0.02 - x)/(x^2). Wait, no, the K is the formation constant, which is for the formation of the complex. So K = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]) = 5e10.

So rearranged, that's 5e10 = (0.02 - x)/(x^2).

Wait, but in this case, the complex is already formed, and we're looking for the dissociation. So K is given, and we need to find the [Ca²+].

But wait, if the complex is 0.02 M, and assuming that x is very small compared to 0.02 (since K is very large), we can approximate 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02. That would make the math easier.

So substituting, K ≈ 5e10 = 0.02 / (x^2). Solving for x^2: x^2 = 0.02 / (5e10) = 2e-3 / 5e10 = 4e-13. So x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, wait, let me compute that again.

Wait, 0.02 is 2e-2. So 2e-2 divided by 5e10 is (2/5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12, which is 4e-13. So sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5? Wait, what's the square root of 4e-13? The square root of 4 is 2, and square root of 1e-13 is 1e-6.5, which is approximately 3.16e-7. So 2 * 3.16e-7 is about 6.32e-7. Oh wait, so x is approximately 6.3e-7 M.

Wait, but let me think again. Let me calculate it precisely. x squared is 4e-13, so x is sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, 4e-13 is 4 * 1e-13, so sqrt(4e-13) = sqrt(4)*sqrt(1e-13) = 2 * (1e-6.5). Wait, 1e-6.5 is 3.16e-7. So 2 * 3.16e-7 is about 6.32e-7 M.

Wait, looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M. So that's the answer, right?

Wait, but wait a second. Let me check if the approximation is valid. We assumed that x is much smaller than 0.02, so 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02. If x is 6.3e-7, which is about 6.3e-7 compared to 0.02 (which is 2e-2). 6.3e-7 is 0.00000063, and 2e-2 is 0.02. So yes, x is way smaller, so the approximation holds. Therefore, the concentration of Ca²+ is approximately 6.3e-7 M.

So the correct answer should be option C.


To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex, we use the formation constant \( K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = 5 \times 10^{10} \). The reaction is:

\[
\text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{4-} \leftrightarrow \text{CaEDTA}^{2-}
\]

The formation constant is expressed as:

\[
K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = \frac{[\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}
\]

Let the concentration of dissociated \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\) and \(\text{EDTA}^{4-}\) be \(x\). Since the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, the equilibrium concentration of the complex is approximately \(0.02 - x\). Substituting into the equilibrium expression:

\[
K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = \frac{0.02 - x}{x^2}
\]

Given that \(K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = 5 \times 10^{10}\) and assuming \(x \ll 0.02\) (valid because \(K\) is very large), we approximate \(0.02 - x \approx 0.02\). This simplifies the equation to:

\[
5 \times 10^{10} = \frac{0.02}{x^2}
\]

Solving for \(x^2\):

\[
x^2 = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} \approx 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) is approximately \(6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}\). Comparing this result with the options, the correct answer is:

**C) \(6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}\)**.
