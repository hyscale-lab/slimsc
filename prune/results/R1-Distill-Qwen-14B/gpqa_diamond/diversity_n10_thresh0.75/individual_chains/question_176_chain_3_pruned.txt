Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The system's state at time t is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, wait, that doesn't look like a unit vector. Oh, maybe I should normalize it first. Because in quantum mechanics, states are represented as unit vectors, right? So I need to find the norm of this vector.

The vector is [-1, 2, 1]. The norm squared would be (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 +4 +1=6. So the norm is sqrt(6). So the actual state vector is (1/sqrt(6))*[-1, 2, 1]^T. Let me write that down: |Ïˆ> = [ -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) ]^T.

Now, the problem is about measuring two observables, P and Q, in sequence. Specifically, we measure P first, then Q. And we need the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q.

Wait, but wait. No, wait the question says someone measures Q just after the measurement of P. So the order is P first, then Q. But the question is about the probability of getting 0 when measuring P and -1 when measuring Q.

Wait, no, wait: the measurements are done in the order P first, then Q. So the first measurement is P, and the second is Q. So the probabilities are conditional, I think. Because measuring P affects the state, which then affects the measurement of Q.

But the question is about the probability of getting P=0 and Q=-1. So we need to find the probability that when you measure P, you get 0, and then, given
