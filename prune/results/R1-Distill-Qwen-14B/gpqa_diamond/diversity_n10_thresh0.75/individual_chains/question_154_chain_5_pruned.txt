Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The question is about identifying an unknown compound based on spectral data. Hmm, I remember from my studies that using IR and NMR can give clues about functional groups and structure.

Alright, the molecular ion peak is at m/z 156, which is the most intense peak at 100%. There's another peak at 158 with 32%, which might be a fragment or isobar. I'll keep that in mind.

Looking at the IR data: a broad peak between 3500-2700 cm^-1. That's a big region. Broad peaks in IR often indicate O-H stretching, maybe from a carboxylic acid or an alcohol. The strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1 is really important. That usually corresponds to a carbonyl group (C=O). So, what functional groups have a carbonyl? Aldehydes, ketones, esters, carboxylic acids, maybe an acid chloride.

The 1H NMR has some specific signals. Let's break it down. The first signal is at 11.0 ppm as a singlet (s) integrating for 1H. High upfield, like around 11 ppm, suggests an acidic proton. In aldehydes, the aldehyde proton is usually around 9-10 ppm, but this is higher. Wait, but waitâ€”carboxylic acids have protons around 10-12 ppm, which fits here. So maybe a -COOH group.

Next, there are two doublets (d) at 8.02 ppm and 7.72 ppm, each integrating for 2H. So aromatic protons. Each is a doublet, which in a benzene ring usually means neighboring to another proton. So maybe a para-substituted ring. Let me think: if it's para, each proton is equivalent to the opposite one, leading to a doublet when coupled with adjacent protons.

Wait, para-substituted benzene would have two sets of protons, each as a doublet. Like, for example, in para-substituted benzaldehyde, the protons adjacent to the substituents would be doublets. Or if it's a carboxylic acid with substituents in the para position.

Now, looking at the mass spec. The molecular ion is 156. Let's calculate the molecular weight. If it's a carboxylic acid, the formula would be C7H5ClO2, perhaps? Let me check: C is 12, H is 1, Cl is about 35.5, O is 16. So 7*12 =84, 5 H=5, Cl=35.5, 2 O=32. Adding up: 84+5=89, +35.5=124.5, +32=156.
