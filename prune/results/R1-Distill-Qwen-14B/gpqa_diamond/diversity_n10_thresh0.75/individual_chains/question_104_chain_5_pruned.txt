Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, I remember that the RV method measures the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravitational pull. The star moves back and forth as the planet orbits it, and we detect that movement through shifts in the spectral lines.

The question says there are two stars with the same mass, each having a planet with masses similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. The RV shifts detected are 5 milliangstroms for planet #1 and 7 for planet #2. I need to find how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1.

Wait, I think the RV shift relates to the planet's mass and the star's mass. The formula I remember is something like the velocity semi-amplitude (K) is proportional to (M_p * sin i) / (M_star)^(1/3) ) * (1/(1 + M_p/M_star))^(1/3), but since M_p is much less than M_star (Neptune's mass is way smaller than the Sun's), maybe that term can be approximated. Oh wait, I think the formula simplifies because M_p is negligible compared to M_star. So K is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital period? Or maybe it's proportional to (M_p * sin i) / (M_star) )^(1/3) multiplied by something else.

Wait, maybe I should think about the Doppler shift formula. The RV shift is proportional to the star's velocity. The velocity of the star (v) is related to the planet's orbit. The formula for the velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) ) ) ] * [ 1 / ( (P * (1 - e²)^(3/2) ) ) ] )^(1/3) * sin i 

But since M_p is much smaller than M_star, M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. Also, e is zero because the orbits are circular, so that term is 1. And sin i is 1 because the planet's orbit is edge-on (otherwise we wouldn't detect it as strongly, but the question says they detected them, so assume sin i =1). So
