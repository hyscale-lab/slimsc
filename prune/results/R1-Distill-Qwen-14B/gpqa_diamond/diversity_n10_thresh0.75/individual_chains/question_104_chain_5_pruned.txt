Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy question about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I remember the radial velocity (RV) method detects planets by measuring the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravitational pull. The star moves a little as the planet orbits it, and we can see this shift in the spectral lines.

The question says there are two stars with the same mass as the Sun, and each has a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. So both stars are identical, and their planets have similar masses.

The key data points are the periodic shifts in the spectral lines. For Planet #1, the shift is up to 5 milliangstroms, and for Planet #2, it's 7 milliangstroms. Wait, wait, no, the question says Planet #1's shift is 5, and Planet #2's is 7. So the shifts are different. But how does that relate to the orbital periods?

Wait, but the question is about the orbital periods' ratio. So the question is, how many times longer is the period of planet #2 compared to planet #1? So we're looking for Period2 / Period1.

I think the RV method relates the semi-amplitude of the velocity (K) to the mass of the planet and the orbital period. The formula I recall is K = (v) = ( (G * (M_planet) ) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) * (1 - eÂ²)^(0.5) ) ) )^(1/3) ) * (1 /
