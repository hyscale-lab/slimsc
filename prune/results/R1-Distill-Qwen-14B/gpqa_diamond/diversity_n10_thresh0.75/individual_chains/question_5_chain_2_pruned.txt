Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked. 

The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. They've given me the components of the operator P in terms of matrices scaled by ħ/2. 

Wait, so the operator P is a vector operator, right? So P has components P_x, P_y, P_z, each of which is a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2. I remember that the general form of a vector operator is something like P = P_x x hat + P_y y hat + P_z z hat, but each component is an operator. 

The direction n is in the x-z plane, so the arbitrary direction can be represented with an angle θ from the z-axis, I think. So the direction vector would be (sinθ, 0, cosθ), since it's in the x-z plane, so y-component is zero. 

The operator in the direction n would be P · n, which is the sum of each component multiplied by the corresponding direction cosine. So that would be P_x sinθ + P_z cosθ. Because the y-component of n is zero, so the P_y term drops out.

Wait, but the operator we're interested in is P·n, right? Because the eigenvalue equation is (P·n) |ψ> = λ |ψ>, and we're looking for the eigenvalue +ħ/2. 

So to find the eigenvector, I need to construct the matrix for P·n, then find its eigenvalues and eigenvectors. But since the eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2, maybe it's easier to find the corresponding eigenvector directly.

Let me write out each component's matrix again. 

P_x is (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
P_y is (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
P_z is (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

So, P·n = (ħ/2)(sinθ * P_x + cosθ * P_z)
