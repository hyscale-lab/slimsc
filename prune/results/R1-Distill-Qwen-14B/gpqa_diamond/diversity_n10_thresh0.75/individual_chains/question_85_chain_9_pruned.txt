Okay, so I've got this question about two planets orbiting a star, and I need to find the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, let's start by breaking down what I know.

First, the star's properties: it has a mass of 1.5 solar masses, radius 1.2 solar radii, and an effective temperature of 6300 K. The planets, Planet1 and Planet2, have masses of 7 and 5 Earth masses respectively. Their radii are 1.7 and 1.3 times Earth's radius. Both orbits are circular.

The question mentions the transit and radial velocity (RV) methods. Oh right, the transit method detects planets when they pass in front of the star, causing a dip in brightness, and the RV method looks for shifts in the star's spectrum due to the planet's gravitational pull. But I'm not sure how that relates to temperature ratios yet.

Wait, the question gives me the RV shifts for each planet. Planet1 causes a shift of up to 0.03 Å in the [OI] line, and Planet2 causes 0.04 Å. Oh, right, the RV method measures the Doppler shift, which relates to the velocity of the star due to the planet's orbit. So the velocity amplitude (K) is related to the Doppler shift.

The formula I remember is that the Doppler shift (Δλ/λ) is approximately equal to the velocity (v) over c, where c is the speed of light. But since the shifts here are given in Å, I should convert that into velocities.

Wait, the [OI] line is at 6300 Å. So for Planet1, Δλ is 0.03 Å, so the fractional shift is 0.03 / 6300 ≈ 4.76e-6. Since the Doppler shift formula is (Δλ/λ) ≈ v/c, where v is the star's velocity. So v ≈ (Δλ/λ) * c.

c is about 3e8 m/s. Let me compute v for both planets.

For Planet1: 0.03 /6300 = 0.0000047619. Multiply by c: 3e8 m/s * 4.7619e-6 ≈ 1428.57 m/s.

Planet2: 0.04 /6300 = ~6.349e-6. Multiply by c: 3e8 *6.349e-6 ≈ 1904.7 m/s.

Wait, but wait, I think I'm mixing up the relation. The RV semi-amplitude K is given by the formula K = ( (2πG) / (P c) )^(1/3) ) * (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3)) ) * (1/(1 + M_p/M_star))^(1/3) ), but that's complicated.

Alternatively, the RV semi-amplitude K is related to the velocity of the star, which is K = (v_star) = ( (M_p / M_star )^( ) ) something... Wait, the RV method gives the
