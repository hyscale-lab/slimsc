Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about annihilation processes. Hmm, let me try to figure it out. The question is about an annihilation reaction where a proton and an antiproton collide and produce two particles of each charge, A+ and A-. The setup says the antiproton is moving slowly, and the mass of A is 300 MeV. I need to find the velocity of particle A. The options are A) 0.77c, B) 0.96c, C) 0.91c, D) 0.86c.

Wait, wait. So the reaction is p + p̄ → 2A+ + 2A-. That makes sense because protons and antiprotons annihilate each other, producing other particles. But since it's creating two of each, maybe it's a symmetric process.

The antiproton is moving slowly. So, if it's moving slowly, perhaps we can approximate that its kinetic energy is much less than its rest mass energy. Wait, but for an antiproton, m_p c² is about 938 MeV. So if it's moving slowly, its kinetic energy is negligible compared to its rest energy. So maybe we can treat it as if it's at rest. But wait, the problem says it's moving, but slowly. Hmm.

Wait, in particle physics, when a particle is moving slowly, its velocity is much less than c, so maybe we can use non-relativistic approximations. But the product particles might be moving at relativistic speeds, so perhaps we need to consider relativistic mechanics here.

So the key here is conservation of energy and momentum. Since the antiproton is moving, but the proton is presumably initially at rest? Or wait, the problem doesn't specify whether the proton is moving or not. Oh, wait, the problem states that the antiproton is moving slowly. So perhaps the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving with some low velocity. But for the annihilation, conservation of momentum and energy must apply.

Wait, but in annihilation, particles and antiparticles annihilate, so their combined rest mass energy is converted. But in this case, the products are four particles: two A+ and two A-. So it's a four-body decay. Hmm, but perhaps because of symmetry, the products have equal and opposite momenta, but that might not be the case here because the initial state has some momentum.

Wait, the initial state is a proton and an antiproton
