Okay, so I've got this NMR and LC-MS question here, and I'm a bit confused, but let's try to work through it step by step. 

Alright, the question says that I'm analyzing a small peptidic compound. The 1H NMR spectrum is mostly fine, but there are two peaks from the same alpha-proton. They have similar shifts and equal integrals together adding up to 1H. So that suggests that maybe something is causing splitting, but the coupling pattern rules out spin-spin coupling. 

Wait, so if it's the same alpha-proton, and the integrals add up to 1H, what else could cause two peaks? Hmm. Maybe it's not coupling but some kind of isomerism. Like maybe diastereomers or enantiomers.

Then looking at the LC-MS part. The crude compound at elevated temperature shows two peaks of equal intensity. Same mass spectrum. That suggests two different compounds with the same mass. Oh, wait, same mass? Because same mass spectrum. So they have the same molecular weight.

Wait, but same molecular weight but different in what way? Maybe stereoisomers. Enantiomers have the same molecular weight, but diastereomers can sometimes as well, depending on how they're arranged. But wait, in the NMR, the two peaks are from the same alpha proton. So for enantiomers, wouldn't the NMR look identical because they're mirror images? Because the environment around each proton is the same. So in that case, the NMR wouldn't show two peaks. Hmm, but the question says the NMR shows two peaks for the same alpha proton. So if it's enantiomers, that shouldn't happen. Unless... wait, maybe the molecule isn't chiral enough, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the NMR shows two peaks for the same alpha proton. So this suggests that the proton is experiencing a different environment in each case. But enantiomers have the same environment for each proton. So that would mean that the NMR would look the same. So if the NMR shows two peaks, maybe it's not enantiomers.

Alternatively, diastereomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties, so their NMR would be different. So if the molecule has more than one stereocenter, and the crude compound is a mix of diastereomers, then each diastereomer would have its own NMR peaks. Oh, but wait, the question says that the two peaks correspond to the same alpha proton. So, in each diastereomer, the alpha proton would be in a slightly different environment. So each would have their own peak. But why are they integrating to 1H together?

So, in the NMR, each diastereomer would have that proton in a different shift. So I'd see two separate peaks. The integral adds up to 1H because each contributes 0.5H or something? Or perhaps each is a singlet. Wait, but the integral together is 1H. So each peak might be 0.5H each, but that doesn't make much sense, since each diastereomer has one proton. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, another possibility: maybe it's a mix of some other kind of isomer, like geometric isomerism (cis/trans), but that's more common in alkenes. For a peptide, maybe it's an amide or something. But in a peptide, the main stereocenters are in the amino acids. 

Wait, the question mentions an amide bond. The options include 'double coupling' during amide formation. So maybe during the coupling reaction, two different products formed. For example, during an amide bond formation, sometimes you can get both the correct coupling and something else, like maybe a side product. But how would that affect the NMR?

Wait, but the question says that the two peaks are for the same alpha-proton, so perhaps it's a matter of diastereotopic protons. No, diastereotopic protons are in different environments but in the same molecule, leading to different shifts, but in this case, the peaks are in the same molecule but in different forms, like different diastereomers.

Wait, another thought: the two peaks in the NMR are due to the same proton in two different diastereomers. So each diastereomer would have that proton in a slightly different environment, causing different shifts. Therefore, each contributes a peak. But since the compound is a mixture, the peaks add up. So the integral of each would be 1H only if each diastereomer has only that proton. But that doesn't make sense because each molecule has that proton. Wait, perhaps each molecule has one of each, but that's not possible unless it's something else.

Alternatively, maybe it's a case of a racemic mixture. Oh, but in that case, the NMR would look the same because enantiomers have identical NMR peaks. So that can't explain the two peaks. So the NMR must be showing diastereomers.

So the options are B and D. Option B is enantiomers, which I think can't explain the NMR. Option D is diastereomers. That seems more plausible.

Wait, what about the LC-MS part? The LC-MS shows two peaks with the same mass. So same molecular weight. That suggests that they're either enantiomers or diastereomers. Enantiomers would have same mass, but different chromatographic behavior? Wait, no, because enantiomers would have same retention time on a normal HPLC column. But if they're using a chiral column, they'd separate. But at elevated temperature, maybe the interaction is different. Hmm, but the question says that the LC-MS shows two peaks. So perhaps the column used isn't chiral, so two enantiomers would co-elute. But in this case, they see two peaks. So maybe it's not enantiomers, but diastereomers.

So putting it together: the NMR shows two peaks for the same alpha proton, which suggests diastereomers because the environment is different. The LC-MS shows two peaks with same mass, which suggests same molecular weight, so diastereomers. So the most likely explanation is that the crude compound is a mixture of diastereoisomers.

Wait, but what about option C: 'double coupling' during amide bond formation. I'm a bit rusty on that. So, double coupling could refer to a situation where two different products form during the coupling, perhaps a coupling where another bond forms, like maybe an intra-molecular coupling or another type of linkage. But I'm not sure how that would present in the NMR. If double coupling happened, maybe you get two different products with the same molecular weight. Hmm.

Wait, so if option C is correct, then the two peaks in LC-MS are due to two different structures formed from the same starting materials. But how would that affect the NMR? Each peak in the NMR would correspond to a different structure. So the same alpha H would have a different shift in each, so two peaks. But would the integrals add to 1H? If the mixture is 50/50, each peak would integrate to 0.5H, but together 1H. So that's possible. But the question says 'roughly equal integrals'—so maybe each is about the same.

So option C would explain the NMR, but why would the LC-MS show two peaks of same mass? Because both would have same molecular weight. So in option C, the two products would have same molecular weight because perhaps it's a case where the coupling forms a different bond but same overall structure. Wait, maybe not. I'm not too sure about option C.

Alternatively, option D is diastereomers, which would have same molecular weight but different physical properties, leading to different NMR shifts. So both options C and D could explain the NMR and LC-MS data. So how to decide between them.

The question states that the NMR shows two peaks for the same alpha proton. So diastereomers would have different environments for that proton, so each would have their own peak. So in the NMR, each peak would integrate to 1H, but since they're in the same sample, the integral would add. But the question says the integrals are roughly equal, together 1H. So that would mean each peak is about 0.5H? No, that doesn't make sense. Because each molecule has one alpha proton, so each diastereomer would contribute a peak of 1H. So if the mixture is 50/50, each would contribute 0.5H each, so the total would be 1H. So that makes sense.

In the case of option C, perhaps during amide formation, two different products form, each with same molecular weight. So in the NMR, each would have their own peaks. So same thing. But why would the two products have same molecular weight? Because perhaps it's a case of a double bond forming in two different positions, but that's not typical. Alternatively, maybe it's a case where the coupling leads to a different stereochemistry, leading to diastereomers, so that's more similar to option D.

Wait, but the option C says 'double coupling' during amide formation. I'm not exactly sure what that refers to, but perhaps it's a case where two bonds form where only one should have, leading to a different structure. So maybe an extra coupling, like a double bond elsewhere. But in that case, the molecular weight would be the same? No, because it's adding more atoms. Wait, but the molecule would have the same number of atoms—it's just a different structure.

Wait, but the LC-MS shows same mass. So same molecular formula. So option C would imply same molecular weight. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the two products in option C are constitutional isomers, but same molecular weight. But then the NMR would have more differences than just the same alpha-proton. So perhaps that's not it.

Alternatively, perhaps during the reaction, the correct amide bond is formed, but another bond is formed elsewhere, like another amide, leading to a different structure. But that would change the molecular weight. So probably not.

So going back, the question says that the NMR shows two peaks for the same alpha proton, same integral together. So it's more likely that the structure differs in a way that affects the environment of that alpha proton. Enantiomers wouldn't do that (same environment), so it must be diastereomers. So the correct answer is D.


The question involves analyzing a small peptidic compound where the 1H NMR spectrum shows two peaks corresponding to the same alpha-proton, with similar chemical shifts, equal integrals (together integrating to 1H), and no spin-spin coupling as an explanation. The LC-MS analysis at elevated temperature shows two peaks of equal intensity with the same mass spectrum, consistent with the expected molecule. The goal is to determine the most likely explanation for these observations.

### Key Analysis of the Options:

1. **Option A: The compound is contaminated with a precursor**  
   If the compound were contaminated with a precursor, the LC-MS would likely show a peak with a different mass corresponding to the precursor. Since the LC-MS shows two peaks with the same mass, this explanation is unlikely.

2. **Option B: The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers**  
   Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images of each other and have identical physical properties, including NMR spectra. If the compound were a racemic mixture of enantiomers, the NMR would not show two distinct peaks for the same alpha-proton. Therefore, this option does not explain the observed NMR data.

3. **Option C: 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction**  
   'Double coupling' could refer to the formation of two different products during the reaction. However, for this to explain the observations, the two products would need to have the same molecular weight (as indicated by the LC-MS) and differ in a way that affects the environment of the alpha-proton. While this is plausible, it is less likely than the explanation provided by diastereomers, as diastereomers naturally exhibit different physical properties and can account for the observed NMR and LC-MS data.

4. **Option D: The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers**  
   Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images of each other and have different physical properties. This explains the two distinct peaks in the NMR spectrum, as the alpha-proton would experience a different chemical environment in each diastereomer. The LC-MS data, showing two peaks of equal intensity with the same mass, is consistent with a mixture of diastereoisomers. The equal integrals in the NMR spectrum suggest a roughly equal mixture of the two diastereomers.

### Conclusion:
The most likely explanation for the observations is that the crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers. This accounts for the distinct NMR peaks, equal integrals, and same mass spectrum in the LC-MS analysis.
