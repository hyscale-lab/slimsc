Okay, so I have this question about radioactive decay, and I'm a bit rusty on my nuclear physics, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

So, the setup is that we have a single atom, and we're observing its decay. It was obtained from a beta decay of another atom, and we start monitoring right away. Previous experiments tell us that the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. Now, 50 minutes have passed without decay, and we need to find the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes.

Hmm. Wait, the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. I think that means the probability of decay in 100 minutes is 32%, so the probability of not decaying in that time is 68%.

But wait, radioactive decay usually follows an exponential law, right? So the decay process is memoryless, meaning the past doesn't affect the future. So the fact that 50 minutes have passed and it hasn't decayed shouldn't change the probability now. Or does it?

Wait, no, the probability given is in 100 minutes, but we're looking at 150 minutes from now. Or wait, no, the 50 minutes have already passed, so the remaining time is 150 minutes. Hmm, wait no, let's clarify.

The initial time frame given was 100 minutes, and the probability of decay in that time is 32%. So the decay constant Î» can be found
