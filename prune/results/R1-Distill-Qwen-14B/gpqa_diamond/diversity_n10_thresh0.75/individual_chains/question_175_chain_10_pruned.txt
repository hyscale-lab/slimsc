Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, oscillating charge distribution, spheroid shape, symmetry along the z-axis. Oh right, when charges oscillate, they radiate electromagnetic waves. The question is about the radiated power per unit solid angle as a function of wavelength λ and angle θ.

The maximum power is A, and the question is asking for two things: the fraction of A radiated at θ=30 degrees, and the possible form of the function f(λ,θ). The options are A, B, C, D.

Wait, I remember from my electromagnetism classes that when a charge oscillates, it's an accelerated charge, and it emits radiation. The power radiated depends on the acceleration, the frequency, and the direction. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact details.

So the setup: the charge distribution is spheroid, which is like a 3D ellipse. The symmetry is along the z-axis, so probably it's oscillating along the z-axis. So the dipole is along z.

In the radiation zone, the fields from a dipole can be approximated by the dipole radiation formulas. The power radiated per unit solid angle for a dipole is given by the radiation pattern of a dipole antenna. I think the formula is something like P = (something) * (sinθ)^2, where θ is the angle from the dipole axis (which is the z-axis here). 

Wait, right, the radiation pattern for a dipole is maximum at θ = 90 degrees, and it's zero along the axis (θ=0 and 180). So the maximum power is around the equator of the dipole, not along the poles.

But wait, the problem says the maximum power is A. So what's the fraction at θ=30 degrees? Let's think. The dipole's radiation pattern
