Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with relativistic calculations, but I'll give it a shot. Let's read the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question is about finding the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) such that the speed of a nucleus X is 0.96c. The nucleus X is defined as Lithium (Li) with 3 neutrons. The options are given in GeV, and I need to pick the correct one.

Hmm, first, I think I need to figure out what nucleus X is. Lithium usually has a certain number of protons and neutrons. Wait, the question says Li with 3 neutrons. Oh, right, Li typically has 3 protons. So the isotope would be Li-6 because 3 (protons) + 3 (neutrons) = 6 nucleons. So the nucleus is Li-6.

Next, I remember that when dealing with relativistic speeds, the energy isn't just the rest mass energy; it's the total energy, which includes kinetic energy. The formula for total energy is gamma times the rest energy (E = γmc²), where gamma is the Lorentz factor.

Gamma is 1 over the square root of (1 - v²/c²). Since the speed v is 0.96c, I'll plug that in. Let me calculate gamma first.

So v = 0.96c. Let's compute (v/c)²: (0.96)^2 = 0.9216. Then 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is... Let me think, sqrt(0.09) is 0.3, so sqrt(0.0784) is a bit less. Maybe 0.28? Let's compute it accurately. 0.28 squared is 0.0784 exactly. Oh, so sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28. Therefore, gamma is 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.5714.

Wait, let me double-check that. 0.28 * 3.5714 is approximately 1. So yes, gamma is about 3.5714.

Now, the rest energy of the nucleus is mc². But I need the mass of Li-6. The atomic mass of Li-6 is approximately 6.015 atomic mass units (u), I think. Because each nucleon (proton or neutron) is about 1 u, so 6 nucleons would be 6 u, but the actual mass might be a bit less due to binding energy, but wait, for the purpose of relativistic calculations, we usually take the mass as the rest mass, which includes all that. So I'll take the mass as approximately 6.015 u.

Wait, but maybe I should look up the exact mass. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to use the conversion factor from atomic mass units to GeV. I remember that 1 u is approximately 931.5 MeV/c². So to get the rest energy, E_rest = m * c² = 6.0
