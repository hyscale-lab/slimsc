Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, RHIC. The question is asking me to find the energy of RHIC such that the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96 times the speed of light, c. The nucleus X is defined as Lithium (Li) with 3 neutrons. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

First, I need to figure out what the nucleus X is. Lithium with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li typically has an atomic number of 3. So, if it's Li-6, because Li has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. So the mass number A is 6. The mass of a Li-6 nucleus would be important because relativistic energy calculations depend on rest mass.

Next, the speed is given as 0.96c. That's pretty high, so we're definitely into relativistic speeds. I remember that in relativity, the energy of a particle isn't just kinetic; it's the total energy, which includes rest mass energy and kinetic energy. But wait, the question is about the energy of the collider, which I think refers to the kinetic energy imparted to the nuclei. Or is it the total energy that their question is asking for? Hmm, I need to clarify that.

Wait, the question says "the energy of the RHIC so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c." So I think the energy here refers to the total energy, which is the sum of rest energy and kinetic energy. Or wait, maybe it's the kinetic energy. I'm a bit confused. Let me think about the formula for relativistic energy.

The total energy E is gamma multiplied by the rest energy (mc²). The gamma factor is 1 over the square root of (1 minus v squared over c squared). Right, so gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Since v is 0.96c, I can calculate gamma.

Let me compute that. So v = 0.96c. Then v²/c² is (0.96)^2 = 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of that is sqrt(0.0784) which is 0.28. So 1 / 0.28 is approximately 3.5714. Hmm, I think that's correct.

So gamma is about 3.5714. Now, the rest energy of the nucleus is mc². The mass m is the mass of the Li-6 nucleus. The atomic mass unit (u) is approximately 931.5 MeV/c². So I need to find the mass of Li-6.

Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. Each proton is about 1.007276 u, and each neutron is about 1.008665 u. So the total mass is 3*(1.007276 + 1.008665) = 3*(2.015941) =
