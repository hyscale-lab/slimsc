Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me see what the question says.

The question involves a series of reactions starting with toluene. The process goes through three steps, and I need to find the molecular symmetry group (which I think is the same as the point group) of the final product, product 3.

Let me break down each step.

First step: Toluene is treated with nitric acid and sulfuric acid. I remember that nitration usually happens when benzene is nitrated, but wait, toluene is methylbenzene. So when toluene undergoes nitration, the nitro group typically attaches to the ring. But where?

Nitration is an electrophilic substitution reaction. The methyl group is an activating group which directs the incoming nitro group to the ortho and para positions relative to the methyl. Since the nitration of toluene usually gives a mixture, but the major product is para-nitrotoluene. So product 1 is para-nitrotoluene.

Wait, no, wait. I think when nitration is done under certain conditions, the para product is major. But sometimes, if the reaction is not controlled, more ortho might form. But for this problem, I think we can assume the major product is para.

Second step: Product 1 (para-nitrotoluene) is treated with MnO2 and H2SO4. I remember that MnO2 is a strong oxidizing agent. What happens when nitrotoluenes are oxidized?

Nitrotoluenes can undergo oxidation. The methyl group attached to the benzene ring when oxidized usually forms a carboxylic acid. So, for para-nitrotoluene, the methyl is oxidized to a COOH group. So product 2 would be para-nitrobenzoic acid. Wait, but let me think again. The structure is benzene ring with a nitro group at one position and a COOH group at the para position? Or wait, no. No, wait. Toluene is methylbenzene. After nitration, the nitro group is para to the methyl. Then oxidation of the methyl to COOH would make the nitro and COOH groups para to each other.

Wait, no, the methyl is at position 1, nitro at position 4. Oxidizing the
