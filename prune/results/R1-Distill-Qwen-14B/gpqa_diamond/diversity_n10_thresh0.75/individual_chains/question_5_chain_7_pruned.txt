Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but let's see if I can figure it out step by step. The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. Hmm, I think this has to do with spin operators because the Pauli matrices come into play here, but let me think more carefully.

The problem gives me the components of the operator P: Px, Py, and Pz. Each is a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2. So, let me write them down as I remember.

Px is (ħ/2) times [[0, 1], [1, 0]]. Oh right, that's the Pauli X matrix. Similarly, Py is (ħ/2) multiplied by [[0, -i], [i, 0]], which is the Pauli Y matrix. And Pz is (ħ/2) times [[1, 0], [0, -1]], which is the Pauli Z matrix.

Wait, the operator in question is P, which is along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. So, the direction vector n is in the x-z plane, meaning its y-component is zero. So n can be represented as (sinθ, 0, cosθ), perhaps? Or maybe it's (cosθ, 0, sinθ)? Hmm, sometimes conventions vary, but I think it's more common to have polar angles where θ is the angle from the z-axis. So, if n is in the x-z plane, then the angle φ (azimuthal) would be zero or 180, but since it's arbitrary but in x-z, phi is zero? Wait, wait, no. Wait, in the x-z plane, the angle phi is 0 or pi, because in spherical coordinates, phi is the angle in the x-y plane from the x-axis. So if the direction is in x-z, phi is 0 or pi. Hmm, but the problem says "arbitrary direction", so maybe it's any direction in x-z, meaning phi is zero, but theta can vary. Wait, actually, the direction is arbitrary in the x-z plane, so the direction can be any angle theta from the z-axis, and phi is zero because it's in the x-z plane.

Wait, but maybe the direction is given by angles theta and phi, but since it's in x-z, phi is zero. So the unit vector n is (sinθ, 0, cosθ), assuming theta is measured from the z-axis.

But the operator P is the component along n, so the operator P is the dot product of the vector P (which is the vector operator with components Px, Py, Pz) with the direction vector n. So,

P = n · P = (n_x Px + n_y Py + n_z Pz).

But since n is in the x-z plane, n_y is zero, so P = n_x Px + n_z Pz.

So, substituting the values:

n_x is sinθ (assuming n is (sinθ, 0, cosθ)), and n_z is cosθ. So,

P = sinθ * (ħ/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]] + cosθ * (ħ/2) * [[1,0],[0,-1]]

Let me compute this matrix. Let's factor out ħ/2:

P = (ħ/2) [ sinθ * [[0,1],[1,0]] + cosθ * [[1,0],[0,-1]] ]

Compute the matrix inside:

First part for sinθ:
Row 1: [0, sinθ]
Row 2: [sinθ, 0]

Second part for cosθ:
Row 1: [cosθ, 0]
Row 2: [0, -cosθ]

Adding them together:

Row 1: [cosθ, sinθ]
Row 2: [sinθ, -cosθ]

So the matrix is [[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ]] multiplied by ħ/2.

Now, we need to find the eigenvector of this matrix corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. Because the eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2.

So, the eigenvalue equation is:

P |ψ> = (+ħ/2) |ψ>

But since P is (ħ/2) multiplied by the [[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ]] matrix, the equation becomes:

(ħ/2) [[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ]] |v> = (ħ/2) |v>

Multiply both sides by 2/ħ to simplify:

[[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ]] |v> = |v>

So, the matrix equation is:

[ [cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ] ] * [a; b] = [a; b]

Which gives the two equations:

a cosθ + b sinθ = a
a sinθ - b cosθ = b

Let me write these equations:

1. a (cosθ - 1) + b sinθ = 0
2. a sinθ + b (- cosθ - 1) = 0

Hmm, but wait, equation 2: Let me re-express.

Wait, equation 2: a sinθ - b cosθ = b → a sinθ = b (cosθ + 1)

So from equation 2: a sinθ = b (cosθ + 1)

Similarly, from equation 1: a (cosθ - 1) + b sinθ = 0 → a (1 - cosθ) = b sinθ

Wait, I can write equation 1 as a (1 - cosθ) = b sinθ.

So, from equation 1:

a = [b sinθ] / (1 - cosθ)

But 1 - cosθ can be written as 2 sin²(theta/2), and sin theta is 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2). So:

a = [b * 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2)] / [2 sin²(theta/2)]

Simplify numerator and denominator: 2 cancels, sin(theta/2) cancels one from denominator.

So a = [b cos(theta/2)] / [ sin(theta/2) ] = b cot(theta/2)

So a = b cot(theta/2)

Now, substitute a into equation 2.

Equation 2: a sinθ = b (cosθ + 1)

We have a = b cot(theta/2), so:

b cot(theta/2) sinθ = b (cosθ + 1)

Assuming b ≠ 0 (which makes sense because then the eigenvector would be zero, which is trivial), we can divide both sides by b:

cot(theta/2) sinθ = cosθ + 1

Let me compute cot(theta/2) sinθ.

We know that cot(theta/2) = [cos(theta/2)] / [sin(theta/2)].

So,

cot(theta/2) sinθ = [cos(theta/2)/ sin(theta/2)] * [2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2)]

Because sinθ = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2).

So,

= [cos(theta/2) * 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) ] / sin(theta/2)

Simplify:

= 2 cos²(theta/2)

So,

2 cos²(theta/2) = cosθ + 1

But wait, cosθ = 2 cos²(theta/2) - 1. So,

2 cos²(theta/2) = (2 cos²(theta/2) -1 ) +1 → 2 cos²(theta/2) = 2 cos²(theta/2)

Which is an identity. So, no new information here. That means our substitution is consistent, and we have a relation between a and b: a = b cot(theta/2).

So, the eigenvector can be written as [a; b] = [cot(theta/2) b; b] = b [cot(theta/2); 1]

So, the components are a = cot(theta/2) * b and b = b.

We can choose b as a normalization factor. Let's set b = 1 for simplicity, so the vector is [cot(theta/2), 1]^T. But we need to normalize this vector.

The norm squared is |cot(theta/2)|² + 1^2. Let's compute that.

cot(theta/2) = cos(theta/2) / sin(theta/2)

So, cot²(theta/2) + 1 = [cos²(theta/2) + sin²(theta/2)] / sin²(theta/2) ) + 1 → Wait, no, wait:

Wait, cot²(theta/2) +1 = csc²(theta/2) = 1/sin²(theta/2). So the norm is sqrt( csc²(theta/2) ) = 1 / |sin(theta/2)|. Since theta is between 0
