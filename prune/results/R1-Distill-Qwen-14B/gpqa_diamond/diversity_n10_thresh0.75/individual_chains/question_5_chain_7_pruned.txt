Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the eigenvector of a muon's operator along an arbitrary direction in the x-z plane. Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, operators correspond to observables, and eigenvectors represent the states with definite values. The eigenvalue here is +ħ/2, so the eigenvector should be associated with that.

Wait, the operator is given along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. Oh right, so this direction isn't one of the standard x, y, or z axes. So I'll probably have to express the operator P in terms of this direction.

The components of P are given for X, Y, and Z. So P_x is (ħ/2) times a matrix [[0,1],[1,0]], which is the Pauli X matrix. Similarly, P_y is (ħ/2) times [[0, -i],[i,0]], the Pauli Y matrix, and P_z is (ħ/2) times [[1,0],[0,-1]], the Pauli Z matrix.

So the general operator P along n would be the sum of the components multiplied by the direction cosines. Since n is in the x-z plane, its direction can be written as (sinθ, 0, cosθ) maybe? Or is it (cosθ, 0, sinθ)? Wait, no, in spherical coordinates, θ is the polar angle from the z-axis. So the direction vector would be (sinθ cosφ, sinθ sinφ, cosθ). But since it's in the x-z plane, φ would be zero or π. Wait, wait, wait. If the direction is in the x-z plane, that means the y-component is zero. So φ is either 0 or π. So the direction vector would be (sinθ, 0, cosθ) if φ=0, or (-sinθ, 0, cosθ) if φ=π. Hmm, but since the direction is arbitrary, maybe I'll just say n = (a, 0, b), where a² + b² =1. Or perhaps more simply, n can be written as (sinθ, 0, cosθ), assuming θ is the angle from the z-axis.

So the operator P along n is given by P = n ·
