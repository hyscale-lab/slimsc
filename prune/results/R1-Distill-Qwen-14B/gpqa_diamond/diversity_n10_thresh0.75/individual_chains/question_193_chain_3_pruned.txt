Okay, so I have this astronomy question here. Let's see what it's about. Hmm. The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. And the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance r. The options are from A to D, each with different exponents of r.

Alright, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance. So, distance r is inversely proportional to parallax. The formula I think is plx = 1/r, where r is in parsecs. So plx is in arcseconds, and r in parsecs. So r = 1/(plx).

The number of stars varies with 1/plx^5. Let me write that down. So Number of stars N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5. But I need to express this in terms of r, since the question is about how N changes with distance.

Since r = 1/plx, plx = 1/r. Let me substitute that into the expression for N. So N ∝ 1/( (1/r) )^5. Because plx is 1 over r. So (1/r)^5 is 1/r^5. Therefore, 1 divided by that would be r^5. Because 1/(1/r^5) is r^5.

Wait, let me make sure I'm doing this right. N ∝ 1/(plx^5) → since plx = 1/r, plx^5 is (1/r)^5 = 1/(r^5). So 1/(plx^5) becomes 1/(1/(r^5)) ) which is r^5. So N is proportional to r^5. So per unit distance range r, the number increases with r^5.

Wait, but the question says "how does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?" So per unit r, like as r increases, by how much does N change.

Alternatively, maybe I should think about it in terms of differential number of stars. Like, how many stars are there per a small change in r. So perhaps I should model N as a function of r and find how it scales.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about the density of stars. The number per unit volume, but I'm not sure. Wait, but the
