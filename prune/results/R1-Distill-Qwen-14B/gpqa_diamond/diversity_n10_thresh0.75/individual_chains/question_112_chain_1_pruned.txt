Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let's see what it's about. Hmm. The question involves an electron state, and we're supposed to find probabilities and an average value of an operator. Alright, let's break this down step by step.

First, the state is given as |alpha> proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. Proportional means we need to normalize it. So I'll need to find the normalization constant to make sure the state has a norm of 1.

Wait, |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin. So they form an orthonormal basis. That should make things easier because when I calculate the inner product, it's just the sum of the squares of the coefficients.

So, the state |alpha> is (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. To find the normalization, I'll compute the inner product <alpha|alpha>.

Let's compute that. The coefficients are (1+i) and (2-i). So the inner product is (1-i)(2+i) (from the first term) and (2+i)(2-i) (from the second term). Wait, no, wait. Wait, the normalization is the sum of the squares of the absolute values of each coefficient.

Ah, yes, right. For a state a|up> + b|down>, the normalization is |a|² + |b|² = 1. So compute |1+i|² and |2 - i|².

Calculating |1+i|²: (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2. Because (1+i)(1-i) =1 +1=2.

And |2 - i|²: (2)^2 + (1)^2 =4 +1=5.

So the total is 2 +5=7. So the normalized state is (1+i)/√7 |up> + (2 -i)/√7 |down>.

Now, the next part is about the operator whose matrix representation has elements A_ij. The problem says A_ij = hbar/2 if i ≠ j, and 0 otherwise.

Wait, so the matrix is 2x2. Because the electron's spin is in two states (up and down). So the matrix would be:

A = [ [0, hbar/2],
      [hbar/2,
