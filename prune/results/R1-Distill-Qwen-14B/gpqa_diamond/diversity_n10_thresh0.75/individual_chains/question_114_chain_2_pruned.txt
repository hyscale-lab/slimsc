Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this stuff, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is about.

The question involves two reactions, and I need to pick the right reagents (A and B) from the given options. Let me break down each part.

First reaction:
Butan-2-one (which I think is methyl acetone, maybe also called 2-butanone) reacts with NaCN and reagent A to form 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Hmm, wait, 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile sounds like a nitrile with a hydroxyl group and a methyl group on the same carbon. So, maybe it's a ketone that's undergoing some kind of addition reaction.

Second reaction:
The product from the first reaction, 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile, reacts with reagent B in the presence of H2O to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. So here, the nitrile group is being converted into a carboxylic acid. I remember that converting nitriles to carboxylic acids usually involves hydrolysis, possibly under acidic or basic conditions.

Let me tackle the first reaction first. Butan-2-one is a ketone. When a ketone reacts with NaCN, I think it's a nucleophilic addition. The mechanism probably involves the formation of an enol or enolate. But wait, wait, I'm a bit confused. Wait, NaCN is a source of CN- ions. So, in a ketone, the carbonyl group can undergo addition with a nucleophile.

Wait, but when a ketone reacts with a cyanide, like NaCN, under what conditions does it add? I think the reaction is acid-catalyzed. So, the ketone would first be protonated, making it more electrophilic. Then the CN- would attack the carbonyl carbon. That would form a cyanohydrin. So, the product would have an alcohol (from the proton) and a nitrile group attached to the same carbon as the original carbonyl.

So, the reagent A, in the first reaction, must be an acid. Because the addition of H+ (protonation) is needed for the nucleophilic attack. Looking at the options, reagent A is either H3O+ or NaHSO3. H3O+ is just a strong acid, sulfuric acid maybe? Or maybe it's a mineral acid. NaHSO3 is sodium bisulfite, which is a weaker acid, I think.

So, for the first reaction, the reagent A is probably H3O+ or something that provides H+ to protonate the ketone. So, looking at the options, options A and B have A as H3O+, while C and D have A as NaHSO3.

But wait, another thought: sometimes, when you have a ketone reacting with a cyanide, maybe the reaction uses a different acid. I'm not sure. Let me think about the conditions. Protonation of the carbonyl is necessary for the nucleophilic attack. So, H3O+ (like in aqueous H2SO4 maybe) would be the right reagent.

So, for the first part, A is H3O+â€”so options A or B.

Now, the second reaction: the nitrile is being converted to a carboxylic acid. So, the nitrile goes through hydrolysis. How is that done? Well, nitriles can be hydrolyzed to carboxylic acids under acidic or basic conditions.

Wait, but looking at the product, it's a carboxylic acid. So the reaction is likely under acidic hydrolysis conditions. Alternatively, sometimes nitriles are hydrolyzed using H2O and a strong acid or base. But wait, in the presence of H2O and reagent B.

Wait the question says reagent B reacts with H2O. So, the solution is in water, and B is the catalyst or acid.

For hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids,
