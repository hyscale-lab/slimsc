Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about finding the uncertainty in the P_z operator, given that the system is in an eigenstate of P_x.

Wait, the system is in an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ. The explicit state is given as a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). And the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z, so the state is expressed in the P_z basis.

I remember that the uncertainty in an observable is given by the square root of the expectation of the operator squared minus the square of the expectation of the operator. So for ΔP_z, it's sqrt( <P_z²> - <P_z>² ).

But wait, since the state is an eigenstate of P_x, the expectation values of P_z and P_z squared might not necessarily be zero. Let me think.

First, I need to compute <P_z>, the expectation value of P_z. That would be the state vector multiplied by P_z matrix, then taking the dot product.

The state vector |ψ> is [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ]^T.

The P_z matrix is diagonal, right? Because its basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z. So the diagonal entries are ħ, 0, and -ħ.

So P_z is a 3x3 matrix:
[ ħ    0     0   ]
[ 0    0     0   ]
[ 0    0   -ħ ]

To compute <P_z>, I can just take the diagonal elements multiplied by the corresponding probabilities, because the state is a vector in this basis.

Wait, the state |ψ> is a column vector, so components are ψ₁, ψ₂, ψ₃.

So the expectation value <P_z> is ψ₁*(ħ) + ψ₂*(0) + ψ₃*(-ħ).

Plugging in the values: (-1/2)*ħ + (1/√2)*0 + (-1/2)*(-ħ) = (-ħ/2) + 0 + (ħ/2) = 0.

Oh, so <P_z> is
