Okay, so I have this NMR question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem is about a 1H NMR spectrum of a solution that's a 1:1 mixture of two aromatic compounds with the molecular formula C10H14. The spectrum shows two singlets around 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio. Then there are three signals around 2.2 ppm, all singlets, in a 2:1:1 ratio. I need to find out which two compounds from the given options are present.

The options are four different tetramethylbenzenes and one with diethyl groups. Let me list them:

Option A: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene
Option B: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene
Option C: 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene
Option D: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene

Hmm. So the compounds have the same formula C10H14. Wait, let me check each structure. 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene would have four methyl groups attached to the ring. Same for the others. Diethyl would be two ethyl groups, which are C2H5 each. So 1,4-diethylbenzene would have two ethyl groups on the benzene ring, making the molecular formula C8H10 (since benzene is C6H6, each ethyl adds C2H5, so two ethyls add 2*(C2H5)= C4H10, total C6+4= C10, H6+10= H16? Wait, wait, no. Benzene is six carbons, each ethyl is two carbons. So two ethyls would be four carbons, so 6+4=10 C. And hydrogen: benzene is 6 H, each ethyl has 5 H (but actually, when attached, each ethyl would have 2*5=10 H?), wait, no, ethyl groups are CH2CH3. So each ethyl contributes 2*2 + 3 = 7 H? No, wait, wait, the benzene ring has substituents. Each ethyl group is -CH2CH3. So each ethyl has 2+3 =5 H. Two ethyls would contribute 10 H. Benzene has 6 H. But wait, when the benzene has substituents, the H count changes. Wait, no, benzene itself is C6H6. If you have substituents, each substituent replaces a H. So for example, if benzene has two substituents, like two methyl groups, then the formula would be C8H10 because each methyl adds one C and three H, but removes one H from the benzene. Wait, benzene is C6H6. Adding a methyl group (C1H3) would make it C7H7? No, wait, no. Let me think:

Benzene has 6 C and 6 H. Each substituent group replaces an H. So, for each substituent, the number of H decreases by one, but the substituent adds its own H. So, for example, toluene (methylbenzene) is C7H8. Because benzene (6 C,6 H) + CH3 (1 C,3 H) â†’ 7 C, 9 H? Wait, no, wait, that's not right. Wait, wait, no. Benzene has 6 H. Each substituent (like methyl) adds a group. So the total H in toluene is 5 (from benzene) + 3 (from methyl) =8 H. So the formula is C7H8. So for each substituent, you lose one H, but add the substituent's H. So, for a diethylbenzene (1,4-diethyl), it's benzene (6 C,6 H) plus two ethyl groups (each -CH2CH3). Each ethyl has 5 H (since the ethyl group is CH2CH3, which has 2+3=5 H). But wait, the benzene loses two H (as each substituent replaces an H). So the total H would be 6 (benzene) - 2 (replaced) + 5*2 (from ethyls) = 6-2=4 +10=14 H. So formula is C8 (6 from benzene + 2 ethyls = 6+4=10 C?) Wait, benzene is 6 C, each ethyl is 2 C, so two ethyls adds 4 C, total 10 C. So molecular formula is C10H14. Yes, that matches the question.

So 1,4-diethylbenzene is C10H14, same as the others. So all the options have compounds with C10H14.

Now, looking at the NMR data. The aromatic region shows two singlets around 6.7 ppm. Each singlet must correspond to a set of equivalent aromatic protons. The ratio 1:1 suggests that each compound contributes a certain number of non-equivalent protons, but their signals are split into two.

Wait, the mixture is 1:1, but the signals are in 1:1 ratio. So probably each aromatic region signal comes from each compound. So each compound has a singlet in the aromatic region. So each compound has equivalent aromatic protons, but each contributes a different singlet. So each has a single set of equivalent aromatic protons.

Wait, but wait. Let's think about the structures. For a tetramethyl benzene, the number of equivalent protons depends on the positions of the methyl groups.

For example, 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene. Let's draw it: positions 1,2,3,4 have methyl groups. So the ring would have methyls at adjacent positions. Wait, wait, positions 1,2,3,4 are in a row, so that's like 1,2,3,4 being four consecutive positions. So the structure would be a benzene ring with four methyl groups in positions 1,2,3,4. That leaves positions 5 and 6. Does that leave any equivalent hydrogens?

Wait, the ring would have four methyl groups, so the remaining two positions (5 and 6) would each have a hydrogen. But in 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene, the substituents are in positions 1,2,3,4. So the structure is actually a naphthalene-like arrangement? No, benzene is a six-membered ring. Let me think: positions 1,2,3,4 are adjacent, so the substituents are on four consecutive carbons, making the ring have four methyl groups and two H's opposite each other.

Wait, no, on a benzene ring, if substituents are on 1,2,3,4, that's four substituents in a row. So the ring would have substituents on adjacent positions. The structure would have H's on positions 5 and 6. Are these H's equivalent? Let's see: if the substituents are at 1,2,3,4, then positions 5 and 6 are opposite each other but are they equivalent?

Wait, in a benzene ring, substituents in positions 1,2,3,4 would mean that positions 5 and 6 are each adjacent to substituents. Wait, let me visualize: imagine benzene with substituents at 1,2,3,4. So the structure is like 1,2,3,4-tetrasubstituted. Then positions 5 and 6 are adjacent to substituents at 4 and 1, respectively. Are positions 5 and 6 equivalent? Hmm, maybe not. Because if the substituents are on 1,2,3,4, then positions 5 and 6 are each next to substituents, but their environments might be different.

Wait, alternatively, maybe the ring has symmetry. Let me think: in 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene, perhaps the structure has a plane of symmetry that makes the H's at positions 5 and 6 equivalent. Let me imagine the ring: positions 1,2,3,4 are all methyl. So positions 5 and 6 each have H. Are they in equivalent environments?

Wait, positions 1,2,3,4 are adjacent. So the substituents are arranged as follows: 1 (methyl), 2 (methyl), 3 (methyl), 4
