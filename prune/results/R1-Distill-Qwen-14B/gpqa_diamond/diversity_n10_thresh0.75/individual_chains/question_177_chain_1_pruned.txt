Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm supposed to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and break it down.

So, there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. Interesting, so both radius and mass are scaled by the same factor. But wait, the question is about luminosity. Hmm.

The astronomers did some spectroscopy and found that the wavelengths where the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, right, the peak wavelength of a blackbody's emission is determined by Wien's Law. Wien's Law says lambda_max is proportional to 1/(T), where T is the temperature. So if their lambda_max is the same, their temperatures must be the same because T = (some constant) / lambda_max. Oh wait, no, Wien's Law is lambda_max * T = constant. So if lambda_max is the same, then T must be the same. So both stars have the same temperature.

Wait, that's important because the luminosity formula for a star depends on radius squared and temperature to the fourth power. Oh right, the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR²σT⁴, but since we're dealing with ratios, the constants and 4πσ will cancel out. So L1/L2 = (R1/R2)² * (T1/T2)^4.

But wait, in
