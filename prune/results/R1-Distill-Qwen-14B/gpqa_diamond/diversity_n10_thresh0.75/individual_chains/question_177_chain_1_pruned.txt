Okay, so I have this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's take it step by step. Hmm, the question is about the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. I remember that luminosity, radius, and temperature are related through the Stefan-Boltzmann law.

Wait, the Stefan-Boltzmann law says that the luminosity (L) of a star is proportional to its radius squared (R²) multiplied by its temperature to the fourth power (T⁴). So the formula is L = 4πσR²T⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.

The question states that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. So R1 = 1.5 * R2. Also, their masses are in the same ratio, but I'm not sure if mass directly affects luminosity here. Oh wait, but maybe the mass relates to something else, like temperature or lifetime. Hmm, but the question says they're assuming black body radiation, so probably we focus on R and T.

The question says that the wavelengths where they appear brightest are the same. Oh right, the peak wavelength of a black body's emission is given by Wien's law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if λ_max is the same for both stars, their temperatures must be the same. Because if λ_max is same, then T is same.

Wait, but let me think again. If both stars emit most intensely at the same wavelength, that would imply the same temperature. So T1 = T2. Because λ_max is inversely proportional to T.

Wait, but in the question, the radial velocities are different. Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0, and Star_2 has 700 km/s. Oh, wait, radial velocity—does that affect the observed wavelength? I think when a star is moving towards us, its light is blueshifted, and moving away is redshifted. But since Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0, its light isn't Doppler shifted, while Star_2's is. But how does that affect the peak wavelength they observe?

Wait, the peak wavelengths as
