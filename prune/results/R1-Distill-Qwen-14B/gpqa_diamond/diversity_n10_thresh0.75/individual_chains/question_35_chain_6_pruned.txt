Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator, represented by Ay. The matrix Ay is given as c multiplied by S, where c is h/(4π), and S is a 2x2 matrix. The first row of S is (0 -i), and the second row is (i 0). So, I need to figure out the correct statement about the eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

First, let me write down the matrix S. So S is:

[ 0  -i ]
[ i   0 ]

And Ay is c * S, so Ay = (h/(4π)) * S.

Since we're dealing with angular momentum operators, I remember that the eigenvalues of the angular momentum components are related to ħ multiplied by some quantum number. Wait, but here, I think the operator Ay is given, which is the Y-component. So for a spin-½ particle, like the muon, the possible eigenvalues should be ± ħ/2, right? Because the spin matrices have eigenvalues ± ħ/2 for each component.

Wait, but wait. Let me think. The spin matrices are Sx, Sy, Sz, each with eigenvalues ± ħ/2. But in this case, Ay is defined as c multiplied by S. So if c is h/(4π), and let me check what that equals. Planck's constant h is 2πħ. So h/(4π) is (2πħ)/(4π) )= ħ/2. Oh, so c = ħ/2. So Ay = (ħ/2) * S.

Wait, but then S is the spin matrix. So the eigenvalues of Ay would be c times the eigenvalues of S. Wait, but S here is the matrix for Sy? Because the question says Ay is c multiplied by S, and S is given as the matrix with rows (0 -i) and (i 0), which I think is the standard form of the Pauli matrix σy, which is used for the spin in the y-direction.

So the eigenvalues of S (σy) are ±i. Because for the Pauli matrices
