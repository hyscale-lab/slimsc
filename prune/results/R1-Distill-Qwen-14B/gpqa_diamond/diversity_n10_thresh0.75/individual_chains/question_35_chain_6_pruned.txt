Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Hmm, let's see... The question gives me that the operator A_y is represented by a 2x2 matrix, Ay = c·S, where c is h/(4π) and S is another 2x2 matrix. The S matrix has the first row as [0, -i] and the second row as [i, 0]. I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay and figure out which of the given statements is correct.

Wait, I remember that the angular momentum operators in quantum mechanics are related to the Pauli matrices. Oh right, the Pauli matrices are 2x2, and they're used for spin-1/2 particles like the muon. The operator A_y is given in terms of S. Let me write down the matrix S:

S = [[0, -i],
     [i, 0]]

So then, Ay is c multiplied by this S matrix. The constant c is h/(4π). Let's compute that matrix.

So Ay = (h/(4π)) * S. Let me calculate each element:

Top-left element: 0 * c = 0
Top-right: (-i) * c = (-i h)/(4π)
Bottom-left: i * c = (i h)/(4π)
Bottom-right: 0 * c = 0

So Ay matrix is:
[[0, (-i h)/(4π)],
 [(i h)/(4π), 0]]

Now, to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. For a 2x2 matrix, the eigenvalues are found by solving the characteristic equation det(Ay - a I) = 0, where a is the eigenvalue and I is the identity matrix.

The matrix (Ay - a I) is:
[-a        (-i h)/(4π) ]
[(i h)/(4π)  -a ]

The determinant is (-a)(-a) - [ (-i h/(4π)) * (i h/(4π)) ) ]

So determinant = a² - [ (-i)(i) * (h/(4π))^2 ]

Wait, (-i)(i) is (-i^2) = -(-1) = 1. Because i^2 is -1. So the term becomes 1 * (h²/(16 π²)).

So determinant = a² - (h²/(16 π²)) = 0

Setting determinant to zero:

a² = h²/(16 π²)
Taking square roots:
a = ± h/(4 π)

Wait, but let me think again. So the eigenvalues are a = h/(4 π) and a = -h/(4 π). So they are real numbers, right? Because the determinant calculation led to a real equation.

Wait, but looking at the options, let's check the eigenvalues. Option A says imaginary parts are ±2πh and real parts ±h/(4π). But the eigenvalues I found are real. So option A can't be correct because it suggests the eigenvalues have imaginary parts, but I think they're real.

Option B says the imaginary parts are ±1/2, and real parts ±1. That doesn't fit either because our eigenvalues are h/(4π) and its negative, which are real.

Wait, but wait. Maybe I made a mistake. Let me recheck the matrix for Ay. Oh wait, the original matrix S is given as:

First row 0 -i,
second row i 0.

So when multiplied by c = h/(4π), the elements become 0, (-i h)/(4π), (i h)/(4π), 0.

So when I compute the determinant, I had [(-a)*(-a)] - [ ( (-i h/(4π)) * (i h/(4π)) ) ]

Which is a² - [ (-i)(i) (h²)/(16 π²) ) ]

But (-i)(i) is (-i^2) = -(-1) = 1.

Wait, no: (-i) multiplied by i gives (-i
