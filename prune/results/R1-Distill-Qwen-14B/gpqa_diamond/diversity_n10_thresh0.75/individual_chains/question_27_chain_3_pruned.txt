Okay, so I have this biology question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again and think through it step by step.

The question is about a conversation between a ribonucleoprotein particle and a nascent chain. The ribonucleoprotein says, "Oh, I know you," and tells the chain to pause. Then it says, "Let me show you in; you really need some sugar." The chain replies that it seems rough and it's time to say goodbye because it needs to be on its way.

Hmm, so I need to figure out where they met and where the chain is heading. Let's break this down.

First, the ribonucleoprotein (RNP) particle. RNPs are involved in various processes in the cell. One common RNP is the signal recognition particle (SRP), which I think is involved in protein synthesis. Oh right, the SRP binds to the signal sequence of a nascent protein chain as it's being synthesized on the ribosome. This binding helps direct the chain to the rough ER for further processing.

So the meeting is between the SRP (the RNP) and the nascent chain. Where does this happen? Well, the ribosome is either in the cytosol or attached to the ER. The nascent chain starts being synthesized, and if it's a secretory or membrane protein, the signal sequence is recognized by SRP. So the SRP would bind to the ribosome in the cytosol, right? Or maybe the ribosome is attached to the ER membrane.

Wait, the initial step is that the ribosome is translating the mRNA, and when the nascent chain starts, the SRP recognizes the signal sequence and binds. So they meet on the ribosome, which is either free in the cytosol or attached to the ER. The RNP (SRP) then directs the ribosome to the ER.

So where did they meet? The ribosome is where the chain is being made. So the meeting is on the ribosome in the cytosol, and then the SRP helps the ribosome move to the ER. So the chain is heading towards the ER, right? Because the next step after the SRP brings it there is for the chain to be inserted into the ER membrane.

Wait, the options don't include ER. Let me look at the options again: 

A) cytosol to extracellular space
B) ribosome to proteasome
