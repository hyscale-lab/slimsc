Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2.

Hmm, first, I remember that in quantum mechanics, observables are represented by Hermitian operators, and their eigenvalues correspond to the possible results of measurements. The eigenvectors are the states the system can collapse into upon measurement.

The operator in question is P, and it's a vector operator with components P_x, P_y, and P_z. The problem gives each of these components as matrices multiplied by ħ/2. Let me write them down:

P_x = (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
P_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
P_z = (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

Wait, okay, so each component is a 2x2 matrix. The operator P is along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. Oh right, in quantum mechanics, the operator for a direction n would be the dot product of the vector operator P with the unit vector n. So, P·n = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z.

But since n is in the x-z plane, that means the y-component of n must be zero. So n_y = 0. Therefore, the operator P along direction n is P·n = n_x P_x + 0*P_y + n_z P_z.

Let me denote the direction vector as n = (n_x, 0, n_z). But since it's a unit vector, n_x² + n_z² = 1. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to express it in spherical coordinates. Since it's in the x-z plane, the angle θ would be measured from the z-axis, I think. So n_x = sinθ cosφ, n_z = cosθ. Wait, no, wait. Or is it the other way around? Hmm. Wait, in spherical coordinates, typically θ is the polar angle from the z-axis. So if the direction is in the x-z plane, then the azimuthal angle φ is zero. Because the direction is in the plane, so φ is 0 or π perhaps. Wait, I might be getting this wrong. Let me think: in spherical coordinates, any direction can be described by θ (angle from z-axis) and φ (angle around z-axis). So if it's in the x-z plane, φ is 0 or π. But the problem says it's an arbitrary direction in the x-z plane, so φ could be anything, but since the problem doesn't specify, perhaps the eigenvector doesn't depend on φ? Or maybe the eigenvector will have some φ dependence. Hmm.

Wait, but the operator P·n is expressible as n·(P_x, P_y, P_z). Since n has components (n_x, 0, n_z), as we concluded, the operator becomes n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

So, the operator to find the eigenvector for is
