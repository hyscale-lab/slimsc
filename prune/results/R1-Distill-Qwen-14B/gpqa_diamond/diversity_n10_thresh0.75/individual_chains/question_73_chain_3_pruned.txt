Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because relativity isn't my strongest subject. But let's take it step by step. The question is about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm.

Alright, the problem says: two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m are moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. I need to find the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

Wait, the options are given, so I can maybe work towards matching them. Let's break it down into two parts: relative velocity and total energy.

First, relative velocity: I remember that in special relativity, velocities don't just add up linearly. The formula for relative velocity isn't just v1 - v2. Oh right, the formula is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)). Because of the Lorentz factor, right?

So astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, astronaut B at 0.5c, both in the same direction. So from the perspective of astronaut A, what's the speed of astronaut B?

Wait no, wait. Wait, in relativity, the relative velocity depends on the frame you're in. But wait, wait, wait. Let me think: if both are moving in the same direction, how does the relative speed work?

So, let's clarify: the relative velocity of B as seen from A's frame. Because each astronaut is in their own inertial frame. So from A's perspective, he's stationary, and B is moving at (vB - vA)/(1 - (vB vA)/(c²)).

Wait wait, let me get the formula right. The relativistic velocity addition formula is u = (u' + v)/(1 + (u'v)/(c²)), but I might be mixing up the reference frames. Alternatively, the formula is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1 v2)/(c²)), where v1 is the velocity of one object and v2 the other, but only when they're moving in the same direction.

Wait, let me think of it this way. Let me denote v_A = 0.6c and v_B = 0.5c. So from A's frame, how fast is B moving? So the relative speed u is (v_B - v_A)/(1 - (v_B
