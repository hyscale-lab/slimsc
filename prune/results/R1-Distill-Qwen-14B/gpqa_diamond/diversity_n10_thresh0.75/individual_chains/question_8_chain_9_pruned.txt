Okay, so I've got this genetics question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

The question is about gene interactions in white lupine related to resistance against anthracnose, a fungal disease. They've done some experiments with knockout mutants and double mutants, and the results are given. My goal is to figure out the relationships between these genes based on the resistance percentages.

Let me start by summarizing the data provided:

- **g1**: 75% resistance
- **g2**: 0% resistance
- **g3**: 50% resistance
- **g1g3**: 10% resistance
- **g2g3**: 0% resistance
- **g1g2**: 0% resistance

I remember that gene interaction studies often look at how different mutations affect the phenotype. Since at least one gene is a transcription factor upstream of others, we're probably dealing with some kind of regulatory relationships.

First, let me think about each single mutant:

1. **g1**: 75% resistance. So it's less resistant than wild-type (100%) but not super compromised. Maybe it's not the only gene involved, but part of a pathway.

2. **g2**: 0% resistance. This is a complete loss of resistance. That suggests that G2 might be a critical gene, perhaps a transcription factor because the downstream genes wouldn't be expressed without it.

3. **g3**: 50% resistance. So it's halfway. Maybe it's part of a redundant pathway or has another function.

Now, looking at the double mutants:

- **g1g2**: 0% resistance. Both g1 and g2 are knocked out. Since both are out, and the resistance is 0%, maybe G2 is epistatic over G1. Because without G2, even if G1 is present, the resistance is gone. Wait, but in g1, the resistance is 75% and g2 is 0%. So if you have both mutations, it's as bad as g2 alone. That suggests that G2 is epistatic to G1. Because when G2 is knocked out, whatever G1 does, it doesn't matter. So the effect of G2 is downstream of G1.

Wait, epistasis is when the effect of one gene masks the effect of another. So if the double mutant g1g2 has the same phenotype as g2, then G2 is epistatic to G1. That's because the pathway stops at G2; G1's function can't compensate when G2 is knocked out.

Next, **g1g3**: 10% resistance. That's lower than either g1 or g3 individually. Hmm. So when both G1 and G3 are knocked out, the resistance is worse than either alone. I'm not sure what that signifies yet.

**g2g3**: 0% resistance. Same as g2 alone. So when G2 is knocked out, G3's knockout doesn't make it any worse. Because the resistance is already 0%, same as g2. So maybe G3 is downstream of G2. Because the presence of G3's knockout doesn't affect the phenotype beyond what G2's knockout already does. So G2 is perhaps the transcription factor, and G3 is downstream.

So putting this together: G2 might be a transcription factor, and G1 and G3 are downstream or in parallel pathways.

Wait, what about the single mutants: g3 has 50% resistance. So in wild-type, perhaps G2 is a transcription factor activating another gene(s), maybe G3. But when G3 is knocked out, the resistance drops to 50%. So maybe G3 is part of a redundant pathway or acts downstream.

Hmm, g1's resistance is 75%. So perhaps G
