Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem about sigmatropic rearrangements. Hmm, I remember that sigmatropic rearrangements involve the shift of a pi bond along with sigma bonds, right? Like, the pi bond moves to a new position. Cope and Claisen are examples of these, and they usually happen under thermal conditions because they're pericyclic reactions, which often require heat or light.

The question has three parts, A, B, and C, each requiring the completion of a reaction. I need to figure out each product based on the starting materials and the given conditions.

Let's start with reaction A: 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine reacts with but-3-en-2-ol in the presence of H+ and heat. Oh, wait, 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine is like a molecule with two methoxy groups on the same carbon as an amine. So the structure would be CH2(OCH3)2NH2. But wait, maybe it's more like (CH3O)2CHNH2? No, wait, ethan-1-amine is CH2CH2NH2, but with two methoxy groups on the first carbon. So it's CH2(OCH3)2NH2.

But-3-en-2-ol is CH2CHCH2OH, but wait, that's not right. Let me draw it: but-3-en-2-ol would be CH2CH2-OH-CH2, but wait, but-3-en is CH2CHCH2, but the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4? Wait, four carbons, so but-3-en is actually CH2CHCH2CH2? No, wait, but-3-en would be CH2CH2CH2CH2 but that's not possible because but has four carbons. Oh wait, but-3-en is CH2=CHCH2CH2? No, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let's see: but-3-en-2-ol would be CH2CH(OH)CH2CH3? No, wait, but-3-en would be CH2CHCH2 with the double bond between carbons 3 and 4? Wait, but but has four carbons, so 3
