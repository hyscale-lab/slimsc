Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about the Michael addition reaction. Hmm, I remember that the Michael addition involves a nucleophile attacking a beta carbon of an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. The question gives me three different reactions and asks me to identify the major products for each. Then I have to choose from the options A, B, C, or D to get the correct answer.

Let me break this down step by step.

First, looking at the first reaction: dimethyl malonate reacting with methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate in the presence of NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) and EtOH (ethanol). So the conditions are basic because NaOEt is a strong base. Dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile because it's a malonate ester, which can form an enolate. The other reactant is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, which has an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl group. 

In the Michael addition, the enolate from dimethyl malonate would attack the beta position of the acrylate. The acrylate is an alpha-beta unsaturated ester, so the nucleophile (the enolate) will add to the less substituted carbon (the beta carbon) because that's where the attack happens.

Wait, the acrylate has the structure CH2=CH-C(O)OCH3, but with a p-tolyl group attached. So the structure is more like CH2-CH(p-tolyl)-CO-OCH3. No, wait, wait. Wait, the structure is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-. So 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH-C(O)-OCH3, but wait, no: acrylate is CH2=CHCOO- group. So 3-(p-tolyl) would be on the third carbon? Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again.

Wait, the general structure for acrylate is CH2=CHCO-O-R. So if it's 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, the substituent (p-t
