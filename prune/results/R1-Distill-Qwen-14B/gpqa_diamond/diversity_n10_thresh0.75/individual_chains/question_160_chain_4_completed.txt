Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about diffraction patterns created by a polygonal aperture. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

The question says the aperture is shaped like an N-sided polygon, and all the apothems are the same length 'a'. When a monochromatic light of wavelength λ falls vertically on this aperture, it creates intensity maxima and minima in the far field. We're supposed to find the angular distance between the first two minima when N is infinitely large. Also, we can assume small angles where tanθ ≈ θ.

Wait, when N approaches infinity, the polygon becomes a circle, right? Because as the number of sides increases, the polygon approximates a circle. Oh, wait, no, wait. Wait, no, wait a second. The apothems are all the same length. Apothem is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side. So for a regular polygon, the apothem is constant. So when N is infinite, it's a circle with radius equal to the apothem 'a'?

Wait, wait, no. Wait, the apothem of a regular polygon is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side. For a circle, the apothem would be the same as the radius. So if the polygon becomes a circle, the radius 'a' is the apothem. So the circle has radius 'a'.

Wait, but wait, the problem is about the diffraction pattern. For a circular aperture, the far-field diffraction pattern is known as the Airy disk, right? The angular positions of the minima in the Airy pattern are given by the condition for the Bessel function zeros. The first minimum occurs at θ = 1.22λ/(π a) or something like that.

Wait, no, the formula I remember is that the minima occur at θ = (p * λ) / (d), where p is the order of the zero, and d is the diameter. Or wait, maybe it's the radius that's used. Let me get this straight.

Oh right, the formula for the angular position of the m-th dark fringe (minimum) in the diffraction pattern of a circular aperture is θ_m = (λ / a) * ( (m * π) / ( (m') ) ), no, wait. Wait, the minima occur where the Bessel function J1 has zeros. The first minimum is at J1(k a sinθ) = 0. And J1's first zero is at approximately 3.8317, but wait, no, wait. The zeros for J1 are at x ≈ 3.8317, 7.0156, etc. So the condition is (π a) sinθ = x, where x is the zero. But wait, when θ is small, sinθ ≈ θ, so we can approximate this as π a θ ≈ x. So θ ≈ x/(π a).

Wait, but the formula I remember is θ ≈ (lambda/(a)) * (1.22), because 3.8317/(π) is approximately 1.22. Oh right, because 3.8317 divided by π (about 3.1416) is around 1.22. So the first minimum is at θ ≈ (1.22 λ)/(π a) ? Or wait, wait, let me think again.

Wait, the formula for the minima in a circular aperture (single slit assumption) is (a * sinθ) = (p λ)/(π), where p is the order (1, 2, 3...). So the first minimum is when p=1, so sinθ = (1.22 λ)/(a), but wait, that's when a is the diameter. Wait, no, wait, wait. No, a is the radius in this problem. Because the apothem is the radius for the circle when N is infinite. Oh no, wait, no, the apothem of a regular polygon is the radius of the inscribed circle. So when N approaches infinity, the polygon becomes a circle with radius 'a'. So the diameter is 2a.

Wait, but in the single-slit (or circular) diffraction formula, the minima are given by (d/2) sinθ = m λ, where d is the slit width (or diameter). So if d is 2a, then d/2 is a. So the condition is a sinθ = m λ, where m is 1, 2, etc. So the first minimum is at sinθ = λ/a. But wait, that's for the single-slit. But wait, in the case of a circular aperture, the minima are given by (a sinθ) = (m λ)/π, where m starts at 1. Oh, wait, I'm getting a bit mixed up.

Alternatively, perhaps in the case of a circular aperture, the minima occur at angles where (π a sinθ) = m λ, where m is the order, starting at 1. So the first minimum is at θ ≈ (m λ)/(π a), but for m=1, that would be θ ≈ λ/(π a).

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Let me check: for a circular aperture, the diffraction minima satisfy a condition based on the Bessel function zeros. The formula is sinθ = (x_m p) λ / (π a), where x_m p is the m-th zero of the Bessel function J_p. The first minimum occurs when p=1 and x_1,1 is approximately 3.8317. So sinθ ≈ (3.8317 λ)/(π a).

But wait, for small angles, sinθ ≈ θ, so θ ≈ (3.8317 λ)/(π a). Let's compute that: 3.8317 divided by π is about 1.22. So θ ≈ (1.22 λ)/(a). But wait, that's the angle for the first minimum. But the question is about the angular distance between the first two minima.

Wait, wait, wait. Wait, the first minimum is at θ1 ≈ 1.22 λ/(a), and the second minimum is at θ2 ≈ (2.4048 λ)/(a), but wait, no, because the zeros of J1 are at x=3.8317, 7.0156, 10.1735, etc. So the first zero is at x=3.8317, second at 7.0156, third at 10.1735, etc.

So the minima occur at x = m * (something). Let me think again. The condition is J1(k a sinθ) =0, where k=2π/λ. So k a sinθ = x_m, where x_m is the m-th zero of J1.

So for the first minimum, m=1: x_1=3.8317. Second minimum, m=2: x_2=7.0156. So the angles are θ_m = x_m / (k a) = x_m λ/(2 π a).

Wait, let's plug that in. So θ1 = (3.8317 λ)/(2 π a) ≈ (3.8317)/(6.2832) ≈ 0.610 λ/(a) ). Similarly, θ2 = (7.0156 λ)/(2 π a) ≈ (7.0156)/(6.2832) ≈ 1.116 λ/(a).

So the angular separation between the first two minima is θ2 - θ1 = (7.0156 -3.8317 ) λ/(2 π a) )= (3.1839 λ)/(2 π a) ≈ (3.1839)/(6.2832) ≈ 0.506 λ/(a).

Wait, that's approximately 0.506 λ/a. Looking at the options, option D is 0.506 λ/a. So the angular distance between the first two minima is approximately 0.506 λ/a.

But wait, the question says "angular distance between the first two minima." Wait, but the first two minima are at m=1 and m=2, right? So their positions are θ1 and θ2. So the separation is θ2 - θ1 = (7.0156 - 3.8317) λ/(2 π a) = 3.1839 λ/(2 π a) ≈ (3.1839)/(6.2832) ≈ 0.506. So the separation is approximately 0.506 λ/a.

So the correct answer should be option D: 0.506 λ/a.

But wait, another thought: when N approaches infinity, the polygon becomes a circle, and so the diffraction pattern is the Airy disk. So the minima are given by the zeros of the Bessel function as I thought earlier. So the angular positions are indeed at θ_m = x_m λ/(π a), wait, wait, no. Wait, because k = 2π/λ, so k a sinθ = x_m → (2π/λ) a sinθ = x_m → sinθ = (x_m λ )/(2 π a).

Wait, for small angles, sinθ ≈ θ in radians. So θ ≈ (x_m λ)/(2 π a). So the first minimum is at x_1=3.8317, so θ1≈ 3.8317 λ/(2 π a) ≈ (3.8317)/(6.2832)≈0.610 λ/a. Second minimum at x_2=7.0156, θ2≈7.0156/(6.2832)=1.116 λ/a. The difference is 1.116 -0.610=0.506 λ/a. So the separation is 0.506 λ/a, which is option D.

So the answer is D.


The problem involves a polygonal aperture with N sides, where all apothems are of length \(a\). As \(N\) approaches infinity, the aperture becomes circular with radius \(a\). When monochromatic light of wavelength \(\lambda\) falls vertically on this aperture, it produces a diffraction pattern in the far field. The task is to determine the angular distance between the first two minima in this pattern.

For a circular aperture, the diffraction minima occur at angles where the Bessel function \(J_1\) has zeros. The condition for the \(m\)-th minimum is:

\[
\sin\theta_m = \frac{x_{m}}{\pi a} \lambda,
\]

where \(x_{m}\) is the \(m\)-th zero of \(J_1\). For small angles, \(\sin\theta \approx \theta\), so:

\[
\theta_m \approx \frac{x_{m} \lambda}{\pi a}.
\]

The first two zeros of \(J_1\) are \(x_1 \approx 3.8317\) and \(x_2 \approx 7.0156\). Using these values:

1. For the first minimum (\(m=1\)):
   \[
   \theta_1 \approx \frac{3.8317 \lambda}{\pi a}.
   \]

2. For the second minimum (\(m=2\)):
   \[
   \theta_2 \approx \frac{7.0156 \lambda}{\pi a}.
   \]

The angular distance between the first two minima is:

\[
\Delta\theta = \theta_2 - \theta_1 = \frac{(7.0156 - 3.8317) \lambda}{\pi a}.
\]

Simplifying:

\[
\Delta\theta \approx \frac{3.1839 \lambda}{\pi a}.
\]

Using \(\pi \approx 3.1416\):

\[
\Delta\theta \approx \frac{3.1839}{3.1416} \frac{\lambda}{a} \approx 0.506 \frac{\lambda}{a}.
\]

Thus, the angular distance between the first two minima is approximately \(0.506 \lambda / a\), which corresponds to option D.

Answer: D
