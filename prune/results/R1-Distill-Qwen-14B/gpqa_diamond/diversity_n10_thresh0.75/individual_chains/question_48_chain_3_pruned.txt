Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says that cyclohexanone undergoes a series of reactions, and we have to find out the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in the final product. The options are A)6, B)8, C)10, D)7.

First, let's break down each reaction step by step.

Step 1: Cyclohexanone is treated with bromine, forming product 1.

Hmm, cyclohexanone is a cyclic ketone. When a ketone is treated with bromine, I think it's a bromination reaction. Wait, but cyclohexanone has a carbonyl group. Wait, actually, in the presence of a ketone, bromine can undergo addition or maybe some other reaction. Oh wait, I remember that aldehydes and ketones can undergo the haloform reaction when treated with X2 (like Br2) under basic conditions. But wait, cyclohexanone is a ketone, but here we're using bromine. Wait, the haloform reaction is usually for when the ketone has at least two methyl groups adjacent to the carbonyl. Cyclohexanone's structure is a six-membered ring with a ketone group. The carbonyl is attached to two CH2 groups. So, the structure is a cyclohexane ring where one of the CH2 is a carbonyl (C=O). So, adjacent to the carbonyl are two CH2 groups. Wait, no, in cyclohexanone, the carbonyl is at one position, and the two adjacent carbons are each CH2. So, maybe it's not adjacent to any methyl groups, so the haloform reaction isn't possible. So maybe the bromine is adding to the carbonyl group.

Wait, maybe it's a different reaction. Oh, wait, bromine can also undergo addition to the carbonyl group. But for that, you usually need some acidic conditions or a catalyst. Alternatively, perhaps it's a diels-alder reaction, but that's for dienes. Wait, cyclohexanone isn't a diene. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the carbonyl group is undergoing bromination via an enolate. But wait, when you treat a ketone with Br2, perhaps
