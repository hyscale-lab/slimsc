Okay, so I have this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem says we have a solution containing Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN^-). The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants for the cobalt thiocyanato complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. We need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species.

Hmm, okay. So I know that stability constants (β) indicate the tendency of a complex to form. The higher the β, the more stable the complex is. The question is about the percentage of the blue complex, which I think refers to the Co(SCN)_n complexes. Wait, the blue dithiocyanato would probably be the Co(SCN)_2 complex, right? Because when I think of cobalt complexes, the [Co(SCN)_n]^m+ ions are usually colored, and dithiocyanato means two SCN- ligands.

So the complexes would be Co(SCN)_0, Co(SCN)_1, Co(SCN)_2, Co(SCN)_3, and Co(SCN)_4. The stability constants given are for each step. Wait, no, wait. Stability constants are given as β1, β2, etc. Wait, what's the exact meaning of each β here. For a complex that forms stepwise, each β represents the formation of the next complex.

So for Co^2+ with SCN^-, the first complex is Co(SCN)_1^+, with β1=9. Then the second would be Co(SCN)_2^3+ with β2=40. Then β3=63 for the third ligand, so Co(SCN)_3^5+? Wait, but wait, each SCN is -1 charge. So each added SCN changes the charge. Co^2+ + n SCN^- → [Co(SCN)_n]^(2-n) ? So for n=1, [CoSCN]^+; n=2, [Co(SCN)_2]^0; n=3, [Co(SCN)_3]^-; n=4, [Co(SCN)_4]^2-.

Wait, but wait, the stability constants. For the first complex, β1 is [CoSCN+]/[Co^2+][SCN^-]. Similarly, β2 is [Co(SCN)_2^0]/([CoSCN+][SCN^-]), and so on. So each subsequent β is for adding another SCN^-.

So the overall formation constants are cumulative. So the overall formation constant, K for [Co(SCN)_n] is the product of β1 * β2 * ... * βn.

Wait, right. So the overall stability constant for the complex with n ligands is β1 * β2 * ... * βn. So for example, K2 = β1 * β2, K3 = β1*β2*β
