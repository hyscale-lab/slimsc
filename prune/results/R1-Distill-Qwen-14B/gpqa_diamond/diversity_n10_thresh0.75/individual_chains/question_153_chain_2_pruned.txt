Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see, the question is about the Michael addition reactions, and I need to determine the major products for each part (A, B, and C) given the reactants and conditions. 

First, I remember that the Michael reaction involves the addition of a nucleophile to the β-carbon of an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compound. The nucleophile attacks the β position, forming an enolate intermediate, which then gets protonated to give the product.

The problem has three parts: A, B, and C. Each requires me to identify the products from the given reactions.

Let's tackle part A first.

**Reaction A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + NaOEt, EtOH → A**

Hmm, dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile because it's a sultam or a di-ester, which can act as a Michael donor. Wait, actually, wait: no, dimethyl malonate is a Michael acceptor? Or is it the other way around. No, wait: the Michael donor is the nucleophile, and the Michael acceptor is the α,β-unsaturated carbonyl. So in this case, the acceptor is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. So the donor would be dimethyl malonate? Wait, no, wait. Wait, I think I got that wrong. Let me clarify.

Wait, in the Michael reaction, the nucleophile (the enolate) attacks the acceptor (the α,β-unsaturated carbonyl). So the acceptor is the one with the double bond, and the donor is the enolate. So in this case, the enolate is coming from dimethyl malonate, which is a good donor. So the reaction would be a conjugate addition.

Wait, wait—actually, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. When we have an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl, like the acrylate here, that's the Michael acceptor. The nucleophile, which could be a strong base like an enolate, acts as the donor. So the enolate from
