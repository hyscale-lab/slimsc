Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let's try to break it down step by step. Hmm, the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember that adamantane has a diamondoid structure, so it's a pretty rigid molecule. Dibrominated at the 1 and 3 positions.

Heating it with excess KOH at 240Â°C. KOH is a strong base, so I'm thinking elimination reaction. When vicinal dihalides (like 1,2-dihalo) react with a strong base, they typically undergo dehydrohalogenation to form alkenes. But here, it's 1,3-dibromo. Wait, maybe it's more about each bromine leaving and forming something else. Alternatively, maybe they are on adjacent carbons in the adamantane structure, leading to elimination.

Wait, adamantane is a bicyclic structure. The 1 and 3 positions are probably on adjacent carbons. So when KOH is added, each Br would leave, but since they're on adjacent carbons, maybe it's a di-elimination. So perhaps two E2 reactions happen, removing both bromides and forming a double bond. Alternatively, perhaps a single elimination, but I'm not sure. 

The product 1 is a light yellow solid. The 1H NMR has some specific signals: 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). IR shows a peak at
