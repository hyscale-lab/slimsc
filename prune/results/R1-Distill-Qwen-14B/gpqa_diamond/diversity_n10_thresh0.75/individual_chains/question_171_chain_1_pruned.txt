Okay, so I've got this question about electrophilic substitution reactions with bromine. Hmm, I need to figure out the order of substances 1 to 6 based on the weight fraction of the para-isomer they produce when brominated. The options are A, B, C, D, each giving a different order.

Wait, first things first. Electrophilic substitution on benzene rings. The substituents on the ring affect the reactivity and where the substitution occurs. The directing effects of substituents determine whether the incoming electrophile goes to ortho, meta, or para positions.

So each substituent can be activating or deactivating, and ortho/para or meta directing. But wait, when the substituent is a strong deactivating group, like nitro groups, they are meta directors. Activating groups like -NH2 are ortho/para directors.

But wait, bromine is an electrophilic substitution. So the substituents on the benzene ring will direct the bromine to specific positions.

The question is about the weight fraction of the para-isomer. That is, for each compound, when brominated, what percentage of the product is the para-substituted bromide.

Wait, but the question says "only one monobromo derivative is formed." Oh, wait, no, I think that's assuming that each substitution only occurs once, so mono substitution. So each starting material has one substituent, and bromine will add another substituent.

Wait, looking at the structures:

1) C6H5-CH3: That's toluene. The substituent is methyl, which is activating. So methyl is an activating, ortho/para director. So when toluene undergoes bromination, the bromine will add to ortho, para positions relative to the methyl group. But since it's a mono substitution, the major product would be a mix of ortho and para, but more para because of steric hindrance? Or maybe not, but I'm not too sure. Wait, toluene typically forms more para-bromotoluene because the methyl group is an activating, para-directing group. So the para isomer is major. So the weight fraction of para would be higher, maybe around 50% or more.

2) C6H5-CO-O-C2H5: That's benzoyloxy ethyl group? Wait, no, wait, the formula is C6H5-CO-O-C2H5. So that's ethyl benzoate? Oh wait, no, wait: the structure is probably benzene ring with a substituent that is COOEt. Wait, that's an ester group. The substituent is -COOEt. So what's the directing effect of that?

Ester groups are deactivating because the carbonyl is electron-withdrawing. So they are meta directors. So when you brominate that compound, the bromine would add to the meta position relative to the ester group. But wait, wait, isn't the ester group an ortho/para director? No, no, I think I'm mixing things up. Wait, ester groups are deactivating because of the electron-withdrawing effect of the carbonyl. So they are meta directors. So the bromine would add in the meta position. So the product would be meta-substituted, meaning that the para-isomer's yield would be low.

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The ester group is -O-CO-OEt? No, wait, the substituent is -CO-OEt. So that's an ester substituent, like in benzene ring with an ester group. So the substituent's effect is based on the OMe group? No, wait, the substituent is -COOR, where R is ethyl. So the group is a carbonyl attached to an oxygen connected to ethyl. So that's an ester group.

Ester groups are meta-directing because they are deactivating. So the incoming electrophile (Br+) would attack the meta position relative to the ester group. So the main product would be meta-bromo. So the para-isomer's yield would be lower. So for this compound, the para fraction is low.

3) C6H5-Cl: That's chlorobenzene. The substituent is Cl, which is a deactivating group but ortho/para director. Because Cl is more electronegative, it withdraws electrons through induction, making the ring less reactive. But since it's an electronegative atom, it can donate electrons through resonance in certain cases, but Cl is a weak deactivating group. So Cl is ortho/para director. So when chlorobenzene is brominated, the major products are ortho and para. But due to steric hindrance, para is more favored. So the para isomer would be the major product. So the weight fraction of para would be higher.

Wait, but wait. When you have a substituent that's ortho/para directing, the major product depends on the substituent's nature. For example, in chlorobenzene, the para product is major because the ortho positions are hindered. So the para product would be the major isomer.

4) C6H5-NO2: Nitrobenzene. The substituent is nitro group, which is a strong deactivating (meta-directing) group. So when nitrated, the incoming electrophile would add to the meta position. So the product would be meta-substituted. So para isomer's yield would be low.

Wait, but wait, the substituent is nitro, which is meta directing. So the bromine would add meta to it, so the para isomer is not formed. Hmm, but wait, nitro is a meta director, so the bromine adds in the meta position. So the product is meta-bromonitrobenzene. So the para isomer would not form much. So the para fraction is zero or almost zero.

Wait, but that's only for the substituent. Wait, no, the substituent is nitro. The benzene ring has a nitro group. When we brominate, the Br adds to the meta position relative to NO2. So the product would have Br in the meta position. So if the substituent is in position 1, Br would be in 3 and 5 (meta). So the para position is 4, so not affected. So the para isomer is not formed. So for this compound, the weight fraction of para is zero.

5) C6H5-C2H5: That's ethylbenzene. The substituent is ethyl, which is an activating group (since it's an alkyl group). So ethyl is ortho/para directing. When ethylbenzene undergoes bromination, the bromine adds to ortho, para positions. But because ethyl is a bulky group, the para position is more favorable due to less steric hindrance. So the major product is para-bromoethylbenzene. So the para fraction is high.

6) C6H5-COOH: Benzoic acid. The substituent is -COOH, which is a strong electron-withdrawing group. So it's a deactivating group and meta-directing. So when benzoic acid is brominated, the Br adds to the meta position. So the para isomer is not formed much. So the para fraction would be low.

Wait, wait. Let me get this straight:

Each substituent's effect:

1) CH3: activating, ortho/para. So bromine adds mostly para. So para is major.

2) COOEt: deactivating, meta. So Br adds meta. So para is minor.

3) Cl: deactivating, ortho/para. So Br adds ortho/para. Para is major.

4) NO2: deactivating, meta. Br adds meta. Para is minor.

5) C2H5: activating, ortho/para. Para is major.

6) COOH: deactivating, meta. Br adds meta. Para is minor.

Wait, but wait. Let's list them with their para fractions:

Substance 1: CH3 (toluene) → para is major → high weight fraction of para.

Substance 2: COOEt → meta → para fraction low.

Substance 3: Cl → para major → high.

Substance 4: NO2 → meta → low.

Substance 5: C2H5 → para major → high.

Substance 6: COOH → meta → low.

Wait, but wait, what about the relative strengths of the substituents and their directing effects? I think some groups might have more influence than others. Also, steric factors can play a role, especially in bulky groups.

Wait, but the question is about the weight fraction of the para-isomer. So for each, I need to determine the percentage of para product.

Let me think about each compound:

1) Toluene (methyl): The substituent is activating, so the ring is more reactive. The methyl group directs incoming electrophiles to ortho and para positions. But since the methyl group is bulky, the para product is more favored. So the para fraction is high, maybe about 60-70% or higher.

2) Ethyl benzoate (COOEt): The substituent is deactivating and meta-directing. So bromine adds meta to the COOEt group. So para is not formed; the major product is meta. So para fraction is low, maybe around 10% or less.

3) Chlorobenzene (Cl): Cl is deactivating but ortho/para directing. Due to steric factors, para is major. So para fraction is high, maybe similar to toluene, around 60-70%.

4) Nitrobenzene (NO2): Strongly deactivating, meta directing. So Br adds meta; para is not a major product. So para fraction is low, perhaps 5-10% or less.

5) Ethylbenzene (C2H5): Similar to toluene but larger substituent. The ethyl group is activating, ortho/para. But more bulky, so para is even more favored than in toluene. So para fraction is high, higher than toluene's.

6) Benzoic acid (COOH): Strong deactivating, meta directing. So Br adds meta. So para fraction is low, similar to CO
