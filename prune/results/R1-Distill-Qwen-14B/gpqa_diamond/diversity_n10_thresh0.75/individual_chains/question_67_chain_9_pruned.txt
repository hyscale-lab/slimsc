Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about two electrons in p orbitals. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question says that two electrons are in p orbital angular momentum states. We're told to ignore their spin angular momentum, so the state is described by |l1, l2, l, m> = |1,1,2,-1>. Hmm, wait, I remember that for each electron, the orbital angular momentum quantum number l is given. Since they're in p orbitals, l should be 1 for each, right? So l1 and l2 are both 1.

Then the total angular momentum quantum number is l=2, and m=-1. So the state is a coupled angular momentum state. Now the question is about measuring the orbital angular momentum components L1z and L2z for each electron and finding the joint probability of both being -ħ.

Wait, orbital angular momentum operators are L1z and L2z, each acting on particles 1 and 2. The eigenvalues for these are m1ħ and m2ħ, where m1 and m2 are the magnetic quantum numbers for each electron.

In the given state |1,1,2,-1>, the m is -1. But wait, this is the total m for the combined system. Oh right, the total m is the sum of individual m's, so m = m1 + m2. So in this case, the sum is -1. But each electron's m can be from -1 to +1 since l=1.

Wait, but the state is |1,1,2,-1>. So l1 and l2 are 1 each. The total l is 2, and m is -1. So when we have the coupled state, it's a combination of possible m1 and m2 that add up to m = -1.

But the question is about the probability that both L1z and L2z have eigenvalues -ħ. That would mean m1 = -1 and m2 = -1, so their sum would be -2. But wait, the total m in the state is -1, not -2. So how does that fit?

Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The state |l1, l2, l, m> is a coupled state, meaning it's an eigenstate of L² and Lz, where L is the sum of L1 and L2. So Lz = L1z + L2z. The eigenvalue for Lz is mħ, so for this state, it's -ħ.

So when we make a measurement of L1z and L2z, their sum must be -ħ. Because the state is an eigenstate of the total Lz with eigenvalue -ħ. So L1z + L2z = -ħ.

But the question asks for the probability that both L1z and L2z are -ħ. That would require that each m1 and m2 is -1, so their sum is -2ħ. But the total Lz eigenvalue is -ħ, which is m= -1. So this situation (m1=-1 and m2=-1) would lead to a total m of -2, which doesn't match the state. So this can't happen. 

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of possible |m1, m2> states that combine to give a total m of -1. The |l1, l2, l, m> state can be expressed as a combination of |m1, m2> states where m1 + m2 = m = -1.

So the possible m1 and m2 combinations are:

m1 = 1, m2 = -2 → but wait, m2 can't be -2 because l2 is 1, so m2 can only be -1, 0, +1.

Wait, right, m1 and m2 can each be -1, 0, +1. So for m_total = -1, the possible pairs are:

m1 + m2 = -1.

Possible pairs:

m1= -1, m2=0 → sum -1.

m1=0, m2= -1 → sum -1.

m1=1, m2= -2 → but m2 can't be -2 because l=1, so m can't be less than -1.

Wait, no. So the possible m1 and m2 for two p orbitals would be combinations where m1 and m2 are each from -1, 0, 1, and their sum is -1.

So possible pairs:

( -1, 0 ), ( 0, -1 ), ( 1, -2 → invalid ), ( -2, 1 → invalid) etc. So only two valid pairs: (-1,0) and (0,-1).

But wait, wait, if m1=1 and m2= -2, but m2 can't be
