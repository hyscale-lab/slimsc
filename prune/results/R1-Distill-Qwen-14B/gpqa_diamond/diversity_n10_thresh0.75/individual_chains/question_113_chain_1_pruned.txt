Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the chemical formula of an unknown compound based on the given spectroscopic data. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, looking at the FTIR data. The very broad peak around 3000 cm^-1 is probably O-H stretching. That makes sense because broad peaks in that region usually indicate either an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. But since I also see peaks at 1700 and 1650, I'm thinking about what functional groups those could correspond to. 

The 1700 cm^-1 peak is a strong one, which often indicates a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, or maybe an ester or carboxylic acid. The 1650 peak is a bit lower, maybe a conjugated carbonyl or perhaps an aromatic ring with a substituent. Oh wait, if there's a conjugated carbonyl, maybe it's an alpha, beta-unsaturated ketone or something similar.

Then the NMR part says there are vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl means double bond, so that suggests the compound has a double bond, like in an alkene. So maybe a conjugated system, like a carbonyl next to a double bond.

Looking at the mass spectrum, the fragment peak at m/z =45. Hmm, what fragments give that mass? Let me think, 45 could be CH3O+ (31 isn't, but wait, 45 is like (CH2)2O?), or maybe a different fragment. Alternatively, perhaps (CH3)2O is 45? Wait, (CH3)2O is 31. So maybe it's something else. Let me think about common fragments. Oh, wait, the group CH3CO+ is 43 (m/z 43), but that's not 45. Alternatively, maybe a fragment like CH2CO-O-? No, that might be higher. Alternatively, maybe the molecular ion losing something. Alternatively, perhaps the base peak is from a common group. Wait, 45 is the same as (CH3)COO- but wait, that's 59. Wait, maybe it's a fragment like CH2CH2O or something, but not sure. Alternatively, maybe the fragment is a ketene ion or something, but I'm not certain. Maybe I should come back to that after looking at other data.

Now, the options are four different formulas: A) C6H12O2, B) C6H10O, C) C6H10O2, D) C6H12O.

Let me consider the possible functional groups. The FTIR shows O-H (from the broad peak) and a carbonyl (1700 and 1650). So that suggests maybe two carbonyl groups, or one and another functional group.

Wait, 1700 and 1650: maybe one is a carbonyl and the other is an aromatic C=C (since aromatic rings can absorb around 1600-1650). Alternatively, if the compound is something like an ester, which has a carbonyl around 1700-1750, and maybe another group like a conjugated double bond. Or maybe it's a cyclic structure with conjugated carbonyl.

Alternatively, the 1650 could be a conjugated carbonyl, like an alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyl. In such cases, the carbonyl peak appears at a lower wavenumber than a simple ketone or aldehyde because of conjugation. So that would make sense with the NMR showing vinyl hydrogens (so a double bond adjacent to the carbonyl group). So maybe the structure is something like an enone (conjugated ketone).

Additionally, the O-H in the IR suggests perhaps an alcohol group. So maybe the compound is a diol with a conjugated carbonyl? Or maybe it's an ester with a conjugated double bond.

Wait, but the options have varying numbers of oxygens and hydrogens.

Let me think about possible structures for each option.

Option A: C6H12O2. Degrees of unsaturation: Each degree is a ring or a double bond. For formula C6H12O2: The general formula for an organic compound is CnH2n+2Ox. So for C6H12O2, the hydrogen count would be 2*6 +2 =14. So H12 is 2 less than 14, so two degrees of unsaturation. That can be one ring and one double bond, or two rings, or two double bonds, or one triple bond. But given the NMR has vinyl hydrogens, so a double bond is present. So that's one degree. The other could be a ring or another double bond. Also, considering the O's, if there's an ester group, that would be O2. So perhaps an ester with a double bond.

Option B: C6H10O. Degrees of unsaturation: 2*6 +2 =14. H10 is 4 less, so 4/2= 2 degrees. So two rings, or one ring and one double bond, or two double bonds. But considering the presence of O, maybe an alcohol with a double bond. But the IR suggests an O-H, which would fit an alcohol.

Option C: C6H10O2. Degrees of unsaturation: 2*6+2=14. H10 is 4 less, so 2 degrees. So same as B, but with two O's. Maybe an ester or a ketone and an alcohol? But the IR has a carbonyl, so perhaps.

Option D: C6H12O. Degrees of unsaturation: 2*6 +2=14. H12 is 2 less, so 1 degree. So a ring or a double bond. But since NMR shows vinyl, it's a double bond. So one double bond and perhaps an O-containing group like an alcohol.

Wait, but the IR shows a broad peak at 3000 which is O-H, so likely an alcohol or maybe a carboxylic acid. But carboxylic acids have very broad O-H (like around 2500-3300 cm-1, maybe broader than alcohol). But the 1700 and 1650 could fit a conjugated carbonyl.

Wait, for a carboxylic acid, the carbonyl is around 1700 cm^-1. But in this case, I have two carbonyl peaks. So two carbonyl groups? Or maybe one is a carbonyl and the other is an aromatic ring.

Alternatively, maybe it's an ester. Esters have carbonyl around 1700, and perhaps an aromatic ring or another functional group.

Wait, the problem mentions that the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, which are typical for a double bond. So maybe the compound has a conjugated system, like an enol ester or something like that.

Another approach: let's consider the mass spec. The fragment at m/z 45. Let's think about possible fragments. 45 is the molecular weight of certain groups. For example, the methyl group is 15, but maybe a fragment like (CH3)2CO is 58. Wait, 45 could be (CH2)2O, but (CH2)2O is 44 (12*2 + 6 + 16= 24 + 6 +16=46? Wait, (CH2O) is formaldehyde at 30. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe a ketene ion? Or perhaps the fragment is from a common group like CH3CO-O-? Wait, CH3CO-O- would be 60? Not sure.

Wait, another thought: the molecular formula of the unknown is one of the four options. Let's calculate the molecular weights.

Option A: C6H12O2. Molecular weight is (6*12)+(12*1)+(2*16) =72+12+32=116.

Option B: C6H10O. (6*12)+(10*1)+(16)=72+10+16=98.

Option C: C6H10O2. 72 +10 +32=114.

Option D: C6H12O.72+12+16=100.

The mass spec has a fragment at 45. Let's assume that 45 is a common fragment. For example, in an ester, the ester group can break into an acylium ion or an alkoxide. Wait, another approach: if the compound is an ester, like R-O-CO-R', then the ester can cleave into R-O- and the acylium ion. Alternatively, maybe the ester group (O-CO-O) could lose something.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is from a ketone. But I'm not exactly sure.

Wait, maybe the fragment m/z=45 is due to a (CH3)2CH+ ion? No, that would be 59. Or wait, (CH3)CO+ is 58. Hmm, not matching.

Wait, another approach: the molecular ion in mass spec is the molecular weight. So the unknown's molecular weight is either 98, 100, 114, or 116. The fragment at 45 is likely a characteristic fragment.

Wait, let's think about the possible structures. For example, if the compound is
