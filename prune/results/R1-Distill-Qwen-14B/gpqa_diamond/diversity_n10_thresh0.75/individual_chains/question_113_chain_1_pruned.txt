Okay, so I've got this problem about identifying an unknown compound using various spectroscopy techniques. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the question gives me data from FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The options are four different chemical formulas, all with C6H something O or O2. I'm a bit rusty on all this, but I'll try to piece it together.

Starting with the FTIR. The very broad peak around 3000 cm^-1 probably indicates O-H stretching. Broad means it's likely an alcohol or maybe a carboxylic acid. Oh wait, but carboxylic acids tend to have a very broad and strong O-H stretch, sometimes even in the 2500-3300 range. But another strong peak at 1700 cm^-1 could be a carbonyl group (C=O). Hmm, but there's also a peak at 1650. That might suggest something else, maybe an aromatic ring or conjugated carbonyl? Or maybe an ester or ketone. Or perhaps a conjugated carbonyl like in an enone system.

Then the 1H NMR shows peaks for vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones attached to a double bond, like in alkenes. So the compound probably has a double bond, maybe part of a ring like in a cyclohexene or something similar.

Mass spec shows a fragment at m/z=45. 45 is a common mass. Let me think: 45 could be (CH3)2O (which is 45 for the fragment), but wait, (CH3)2O is 45? Let me calculate: C2H6O. C is 12*2=24, H is 6*1=6, O is 16. 24+6+16=46? Wait, no. Oh wait, 45. Maybe another fragment. Another possibility is (CH3CO), which is 45. Because CH3CO+ would be 45. Or maybe a ketone fragment. Alternatively, maybe a CH2O group, but I'm not sure. Another thought: 45 could come from a CH3COO group, but that might not fit here.

Wait, let me think about possible structures. The options are C6H12
