Okay, so I've got this problem about finding the partition function for a system of three spins. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The system has three spins: S1, S2, S3. Each can be +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. And we're supposed to find the partition function Z.

Wait, the partition function is the sum over all possible states of exp(-beta E), right? Beta is 1/(kT). So each state contributes a term exp(-beta E) to Z.

Each spin can be +1 or -1, so there are 2^3 = 8 possible states. I'll need to list all possible combinations and calculate E for each, then sum exp(-beta E) for each state.

Wait, maybe there's a smarter way. Let me think about the possible values of S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3. Because each term S_i S_j is either +1 or -1, depending on whether the spins are aligned or opposite.

Let me denote the sum as M = S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3. So E = -J M.

So, each state contributes exp(beta J M) to Z because E is -J M, so exp(-beta E) is exp(beta J M).

So Z is the sum of exp(beta J M) over all possible states.

Now, what are the possible values of M? Since each term is +1 or -1, M can range. Let's see. Each term is either 1 or -1, so the sum of three terms can be:

Maximum: 3 (if all terms are +1)
Minimum: -3 (if all terms are -1)
But more likely, possible values are 3, 1, -1, -3?

Wait, let's think. Let me list all possible M for all 8 states.

But 8 states is manageable. Let me list all possible (S1, S2, S3) and calculate M for each.

1. (+1, +1, +1)
   S1S2 = 1*1=1
   S1S3=1*1=1
   S2S3=1*1=1
   M=1+1+1=3

2. (+1, +1, -1)
   S1S2=1*1=1
   S1S3=1*(-1)=-1
   S2S3=1*(-1)=-1
   M=1-
