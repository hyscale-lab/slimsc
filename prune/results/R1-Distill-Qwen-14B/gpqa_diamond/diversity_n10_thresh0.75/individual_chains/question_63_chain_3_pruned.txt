Okay, so I have this physics problem about a diatomic molecule and the quantum rotation-vibration model. Hmm, let me think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try.

The question is asking about the momentum of a photon that a molecule needs to absorb to switch to the next lowest energy state. The molecule is in its fundamental state, which I think is the ground state for both rotation and vibration.

So, the molecule is made of atoms X and Y. Their masses are given: Mx is 20 amu and My is 2 amu. The bond length R is 2 angstroms, and the angular frequency w is 4e14 rad/s. The options are all different values for momentum p.

Wait, the model here is the rotation-vibration model, but I think I remember that for diatomic molecules, the quantum mechanical treatment often combines rotation and vibration. Oh wait, no, perhaps the question is considering the non-rigid rotor model, which probably includes some vibration as well, but perhaps the problem is looking at a transition where either the vibrational or rotational state changes. Or maybe it's a simple harmonic oscillator with rotation considered.

Wait, the question says it's the quantum rotation-vibration model, also called the non-rigid rotor model. Oh, right, the non-rigid rotor model accounts for the vibration of the bond, so the bond length isn't fixed. But in the fundamental state, both rotation and vibration are in their lowest energy levels.

Wait, the fundamental state usually refers to the lowest vibrational state. So the molecule is in the ground state of vibration (n=0) and ground state of rotation (J=0). When a photon is absorbed, the molecule transitions to the next possible state with the lowest energy. But what's the next state? Since the energy levels in rotation and vibration are quantized, the next state would require either a change in J (rotation) or a change in n (vibration).

But wait, the problem likely is considering the molecule transitioning from the ground state (n=0, J=0) to the next higher state, which would be the first excited state. But which transition is allowed? I think that in the rotation-vibration model, transitions can involve changes in both vibration and rotation. But for a diatomic, I think the selection rules are: Δn = ±1 for vibration (so from n=0 to n=1), and ΔJ = ±1 for rotation (so J increases by 1). But since the molecule is
