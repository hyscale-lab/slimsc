Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question involves an electron state described by |alpha>, which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. So, first I think I need to normalize this state because the question says it's proportional, meaning it's not necessarily normalized yet. Because when you measure probabilities, the state has to be normalized.

Wait, right, to normalize, I should find the normalization constant. The state is |alpha> = c*(1+i)|up> + c*(2 -i)|down>, but wait, wait. Oh, wait, the question says it's proportional, so maybe we can just compute the normalization factor by finding the magnitude squared of each component and adding them up.

So, the components are (1+i) and (2 -i). Let's calculate the squared magnitudes.

The first component: (1+i) has a magnitude squared of (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2.

The second component: (2 -i) has a magnitude squared of (2)^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 + 1 =5.

So, the total squared magnitude is 2 +5 =7. Therefore, the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7), because |alpha> is proportional, so the actual state is |alpha> = [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ] |up> + [ (2-i)/sqrt(7) ] |down>.

So, the coefficients are (1+i)/sqrt(7) and (2 -i)/sqrt(7). Let me write that as |alpha> = a|up> + b|down>, where a=(1+i)/sqrt(7), b=(2-i)/sqrt(7).

Next part of the problem: calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of a certain operator. The operator is given by a matrix where A_ij is hbar/2 if i≠j and 0 otherwise. Hmm. Wait, the matrix is 2x2 because it's the spin operator, I think, since |up> and |down> are spin eigenstates.

Wait, the operator has matrix elements A_ij = hbar/2 if i≠j, else zero. So for a 2x2 matrix, the diagonal elements (i=j) are zero, and the off-diagonal elements (i≠j) are hbar/2.

So the matrix is:
[ 0      hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2 0 ]

Wait, that doesn't look right. Because for a 2x2 matrix, the elements are:

A = [ [0, A_12], [A_21, 0] ]

And since i and j are the row and column indices, then A_12 and A_21 are hbar/2. So the matrix is:

[ 0          hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2      0     ]

Wait, but the operator is a 2x2 matrix because we're dealing with spin-1/2 particles, so two states. So the operator is:

A = (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]

Because if you look, the off-diagonal elements are 1, scaled by ħ/2. So the operator is (ħ/2) times the Pauli X matrix. Oh, right, because the Pauli matrices are [[0,1],[1,0]] for X, [[0,-i],[i,0]] for Y, and diagonal for Z.

So, the eigenstates of this operator would be the eigenstates of the Pauli X matrix. The eigenstates of X are |+> and |->, which are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), respectively. Because the eigenstates of X are the superposition states of up and down.

Wait, no, the eigenstates of X are actually |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2
