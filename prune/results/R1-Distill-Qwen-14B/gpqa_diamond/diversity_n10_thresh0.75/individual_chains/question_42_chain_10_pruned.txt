Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem is about three exoplanets discovered using the TTV method, which I think stands for transit timing variations. They're giving me some ratios of their equilibrium temperatures and masses, and I need to find by what factor the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than Planet1.

Alright, let's jot down the given data.

First, the equilibrium temperature ratios:
- Planet1 to Planet2: approximately 1.4
- Planet2 to Planet3: approximately 2.3

Wait, so if T1 is Planet1's temperature, T2 is Planet2's, and T3 is Planet3's, then T1/T2 = 1.4 and T2/T3 = 2.3. So I can write T1 = 1.4 * T2 and T2 = 2.3 * T3. So combining these, T1 = 1.4 * 2.3 * T3 = 3.22 * T3. So T1 is about 3.22 times T3.

Next, the mass ratios:
- Planet1 to Planet2: 1.15
- Planet2 to Planet3: 1.35

So M1/M2 = 1.15 and M2/M3 = 1.35. Therefore, M1 = 1.15 M2 and M2 = 1.35 M3. So M1 = 1.15 * 1.35 M3 = let's calculate that. 1.15 * 1.35 is... 1.15 * 1 = 1.15, 1.15 * 0.35 = 0.4025. So adding together, 1.15 + 0.4025 = 1.5525. So M1 is about 1.5525 times M3. So M1 is about 1.55 M3.

Wait, but I'm not sure if I'm going to need the masses. Hmm, because the question is about orbital periods. Kepler's third law comes into play here, I think. Right, Kepler's third law relates the orbital period to the semi-major axis and the mass of the star. The formula is P² = (4π²/G(M)) * a³, where M is the mass of the star, assuming the planet's mass is negligible. But wait, wait— if all these planets are orbiting the same star, then M is the same for all. So the period depends on the semi-major axis cubed over the square root of (M), but since M is the same, for each planet, P² is proportional to a³.

So if I can find the ratio of the semi-major axes (a3/a1), then I can find the ratio of the periods (P3/P1) by taking the square root of (a3/a1) cubed. So P3/P1 = (a3/a1)^(3/2).

But how do I find the ratio of the semi-major axes? Well, equilibrium temperature relates to the semi-major axis, right? The equilibrium temperature formula is T = [(L(1 - a))/(16πσ a²)]^(1/4), where L is the star's luminosity, a is the semi-major axis, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. But since all three planets are orbiting the same star, L is the same for all. The albedo is given as 0.3 for all, so (1 - a) is 0.7 for each.

So the equilibrium temperature T is proportional to (L)^1/4 * (1/(a))^1/2 * (1/(16πσ))^1/4. Since L and the other constants are the same, T is proportional to 1 / sqrt(a). So T
