Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a pion. Hmm, let me try to remember what I know. The question is about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles when a pion at rest decays. 

The reaction given is Pi(+) → mu(+) + nu. Oh wait, nu is a neutrino. Right, in particle physics, when a pion decays, it typically produces a muon and a neutrino. Since the pion is at rest, the total momentum should be conserved, which probably means the muon and neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta. That makes sense because the initial momentum is zero.

So, the rest masses are given: the pion has a mass of 139.6 MeV/c², and the muon is 105.7 MeV/c². The neutrino's mass is negligible, I think. I remember that neutrinos are super light, almost massless, so we can probably ignore it compared to the other particles.

Wait, the problem is asking for the kinetic energy of the products. I remember that in decay problems, the kinetic energies can be found using conservation of energy and momentum.

Let me think about the approach. Since the pion is at rest, the total energy is just its rest mass energy. The products must share this energy, but also, their momenta must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction because of conservation laws.

Let me model this. Let's denote the muon's energy as E_mu and the neutrino's as E_nu. The total energy before decay is the pion's rest energy, which is 139.6 MeV.

The energies of the products will be their rest mass plus kinetic energy. So:

E_mu = m_mu c² + K_mu
E_nu = K_nu (since m_nu is negligible)

The total energy after decay is E_mu + E_nu = 139.6 MeV.

Also, conservation of momentum tells me that the magnitude of the muon's momentum p is equal to the neutrino's momentum p. So, p = |p_nu|.

The energy of each particle can also be related to their momenta via the relativistic energy equation:

E² = (pc)² + (m c²)²

For the muon:
E_mu² = p² c² + (
