Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work it out step by step. Let's see... The question is about titrating acetic acid with NaOH, and finding the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. Hmm.

Alright, the problem says we start with 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid, then dilute it with 20 cm³ of water. So that's a total volume of 40 cm³. Then we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given, so I can check my answers against them.

First, I think I should figure out the initial concentration after dilution. Oh wait, when you dilute a solution, the concentration changes. The formula I remember is M1V1 = M2V2. So M1 is 0.05 M, V1 is 20 cm³, and V2 is 40 cm³ because we added 20 cm³ of water.

Calculating that, M2 = (M1 * V1)/V2 = (0.05 * 20)/40 = (1)/40 = 0.0125 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.0125 M.

Next, when we titrate this with NaOH, the reaction is between acetic acid (CH3COOH) and NaOH (a strong base). The reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O. So the NaOH will neutralize the acetic acid to form its conjugate base, acetate ions.

At 25% titration: That means 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH. Wait, how do I find out how much that is? Let's see. The volume of NaOH added would be 25% of the volume required to reach the equivalence point.

Wait, maybe I should calculate the volume of NaOH needed to reach equivalence first. The equivalence point is when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid.

The moles of acetic acid initially: 0.04 L (since 40 cm³ is 0.04 L) multiplied by 0.0125 M. So 0.04 * 0.0125 = 0.0005 moles. So at equivalence, we need 0.0005 moles of NaOH.

NaOH is 0.1 M, so the volume needed is moles divided by concentration. V = 0.0005 / 0.1 = 0.005 L, which is 5 cm³. So the equivalence point is at 5 cm³ of NaOH.

At 25% titration, that's 25% of 5 cm³, so 1.25 cm³ of NaOH added. How many moles is that? Moles NaOH = 0.1 M * 0.00125 L = 0.000125 moles.

So, in the solution after adding 1.25 cm³ of NaOH, some of the acetic acid has been converted to acetate. 

The initial moles of acetic acid were 0.0005. After adding 0.000125 moles of NaOH, moles of CH3COOH would be 0.0005 - 0.000125 = 0.000375 moles. And moles of CH3COO^- (acetate) would be 0.000125 moles.

But wait, the total volume now is the initial solution (40 cm³) plus the NaOH added (1.25 cm³), so 41.25 cm³ or 0.04125 L. So the concentrations would be:

[CH3COOH] = 0.000375 / 0.04125 ≈ 0.00909 M.

[CH3COO^-] = 0.000125 / 0.04125 ≈ 0.00303 M.

This is a buffer solution, so I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA]).

The Ka is given as 1.85e-5, so pKa = log(1/(1.85e-5)) ≈ 4.735 (since log(1.85) is about 0.267, so 5 - 0.2
