Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's start by reading the question carefully.

The question involves two reactions, and I need to choose the correct reagents (A and B) from the given options. Let me break down each reaction.

First reaction: butan-2-one + NaCN + A → 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile.

Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, which is methylacetone. I remember that when ketones react with cyanide ions (CN-), it's a nucleophilic addition. The general reaction is ketone + HCN → cyanohydrin. So, this reaction must be forming a cyanohydrin.

So, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The structure would be something like CH2(CO-OH)(CN)CH2CH3? Wait, no. Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Adding HCN would give (CH3)2C(OH)CN, which is 2-hydroxy-2-methylpropanenitrile. Wait, but the product given is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Hmm, that's a bit longer. Oh wait, perhaps the product is (CH3)2CHCN-OH? Wait, maybe I'm mixing something up.

Wait, butanone is (CH3)2CO. When it reacts with NaCN, the cyanide
