Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem has two reactions, and I need to pick the right reagents A and B from the options given.

First reaction: butan-2-one (which is (CH3)2CO) reacting with NaCN and reagent A to form 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction takes that product and reacts it with reagent B (H2O) to give 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. Wait, wait, no, looking again, the second starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. Hmm.

Wait, let me parse the second reaction correctly. The starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. So it's an nitrile group attached to a butane chain which has a hydroxyl group in the same carbon as the benzyl substituent. And when it reacts with B (which is H2O?), it becomes 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. Oh wait, so the nitrile (-CN) is being converted to a carboxylic acid (-COOH). That makes sense because nitriles can be hydrolyzed to carboxylic acids under certain conditions.

But let's go step by step.

First, the first reaction: butan-2-one plus NaCN and reagent A gives 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Reacting with NaCN. What kind of reaction is this?

I remember that ketones can undergo various nucleophilic additions. NaCN is a source of the cyanide ion, CN⁻. So in a ketone, the carbonyl group is attacked by the nucleophile. When a ketone reacts with CN⁻, it typically forms a cyanohydrin. A cyanohydrin is a compound where the oxygen of the carbonyl is replaced by a hydroxyl group and a cyanide group on adjacent carbons.

So the reaction is a nucleophilic addition of CN⁻ to the ketone. So butan-2-one ( (CH3)2CO ) would add CN⁻, leading to (CH3)2C(OH)CN. Which is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, let me structure that. The ketone (butan-2-one) is (CH3)2CO. Adding CN⁻ would give (CH3)2C(OH)CN. Yeah, that's correct. So that's the product of the first reaction.

Now, what reagent A is needed for this reaction? I think that the formation of the cyanohydrin from a ketone and cyanide typically uses an acid catalyst. Because the carbonyl is usually a poor electrophile, so acid catalysis protonates the carbonyl oxygen to make it more electrophilic. So H3O+ (option A and B have A as H3O+; options C and D have
