Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. It's about the Cope rearrangement, which I remember is a reaction involving 1,5-dienes. The question gives two reactions, and I have to pick the major products from the options A to D. Let's break this down.

First, the first reaction: starting material is ((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene. Then we add BuLi and H+. So, I think BuLi is a strong base, often used to deprotonate things. Maybe it's used to form a conjugate base here. The structure of the starting material is a bit complex, so I should draw it out.

The starting molecule is benzene with a substituent. That substituent is a (3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy group attached to a methyl group. Wait, let me parse that. The substituent is OCH2-C(CH2CH3)=CH2? No, wait. The but-2-en-1-yl group is CH2=CHCH2CH2-, but wait, the position is 2-en-1-yl. So, but-2-en-1-yl is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between carbons 2 and 3? Wait, no, but-2-en-1-yl would be CH2=CHCH2-CH2-. Hmm, maybe I'm getting that wrong. Alternatively, perhaps it's CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 but with a double bond between 2 and 3, and the substituent is at position 1. So the structure is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but the double bond is between C2 and C3, making it CH2=CHCH2CH2-. But the substituent is at position 1, so that would be the CH2 group attached to the oxygen.

Wait, the substituent is (3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl. So the part after the oxy is methyl, so the structure is O-CH2-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2? No, wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The substituent
