Alright, so I've got this genetics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this stuff, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is about.

Okay, the scenario is about an experiment with white lupine plants and their resistance to anthracnose, a fungal disease. They found three candidate genes, G1, G2, G3. They made knockout mutants for each and also double mutants (g1g2, g1g3, g2g3). The question is about determining the interaction between these genes based on the resistance levels they observed.

The key here is understanding what the resistance percentages mean. The control (wild-type) is 100%. So, each mutant's percentage is how much resistance they have compared to the wild-type.

Looking at the data:

- g1: 75% → so, less resistant than wild-type but still has some resistance.
- g2: 0% → completely susceptible. So knocking out G2 makes them lose all resistance.
- g3: 50% → less than half the resistance. So G3's product is important but not as much as G2's.
- Double mutants:
  - g1g3: 10% → very low resistance. Lower than either single mutant's (g1 is 75, g3 is 50; together, it's worse than either alone)
  - g2g3: 0% → same as g2. So adding g3 to g2 doesn't change the resistance. Since g2 is already 0%, the double mutant doesn't get any worse.
  - g1g2: 0% → same as g2. So when G1 and G2 are both knocked out, the resistance is 0%, same as when only G2 is knocked out.

The question states that at least one of the genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of others. So, transcription factors usually regulate the expression of other genes. So, if a transcription factor is knocked out, the downstream genes might not be expressed.

Now, I need to figure out the relationships between these genes. Let's think about epistasis and redundancy.

Epistasis is when the effect of one gene is dependent on the presence of one or more 'modifier genes'. If gene A is epistatic over gene B, then the phenotype of gene B can only be seen if gene A is functional. So if you have a double mutant of A and B, the phenotype might look like A is the one determining the outcome.

Gene redundancy is when two genes produce similar or identical products, so knocking out both doesn't change the phenotype much beyond what's seen with either single knockout.

Pleiotropy is when a single gene affects multiple traits. Not sure if that's relevant here, but it's an option in the choices.

First, looking at the single mutants:

g2 has 0% resistance. That suggests that G2 is essential for resistance. If you can't make G2's product, the plant can't resist the disease. So G2 might be a transcription factor that activates other defense genes. Without G2, those downstream genes aren't expressed, so the plant can't resist the pathogen.

G1's mutant is 75% resistance. So knocking out G1 reduces resistance but doesn't eliminate it. So G1 might be contributing to resistance but isn't the only factor. Maybe G1 works in a pathway alongside others.

G3's mutant is 50% resistance. So knocking it out reduces resistance more than G1 but less than G2. So G3 contributes to resistance but perhaps not as critical as G2.

Now, looking at the double mutants:

g1g2: 0%. Since knocking out G2 alone leads to 0% resistance, adding G1 knockout doesn't change that. So whether G1 is present or not doesn't matter when G2 is absent. That suggests that G2 is upstream of G1, or that G2's function is necessary for G1's function. Alternatively, maybe G1 and G2 are in parallel pathways but G2 is the main one.

g1g3: 10% resistance. So when both G1 and G3 are knocked out, the resistance is worse than either alone. So perhaps G1 and G3 are in the same pathway, and each contributes some level of resistance. So knocking both out makes it worse. But what does this mean in terms of their relationship?

g2g3: 0% resistance. Since g2 alone is 0%, adding G3 knockout doesn't make it any worse. So the presence or absence of G3 doesn't affect the resistance when G2 is knocked out. So G3 might be downstream of G2 or in a different pathway.

Hmm, but how do we figure out the transcription factor part? The question says at least one is a transcription factor upstream of others.

G2's knockout leads to full susceptibility (0%). So perhaps G2 is a transcription factor that activates other genes, like G1 and G3. If that's the case, then without G2, those downstream genes aren't expressed, hence no resistance.

Wait, but for the double mutants:

Looking at the g2g3 mutant, which is 0%. So when both G2 and G3 are knocked out, it's the same as when only G2 is knocked out. That suggests that G3's function is somehow dependent on G2. So if G2 is a TF that activates G3, then without G2, G3 isn't expressed anyway. So the double mutant g2g3 wouldn't have any additional effect beyond g2.

Similarly, for the g2g1 mutant, it's 0% resistance, same as g2. So G1's function is only relevant when G2 is present. So G1's gene product might be downstream of G2. Like, G2 activates G1. But in that case, why does the single g1 mutant have 75% resistance? Because G2 is still functional. So when G1 is knocked out, but G2 is present, the other gene(s) downstream of G2 might take over some of the function, resulting in 75% resistance. So G2 is the master regulator, and G1 and G3 are downstream, perhaps in parallel pathways.

Wait, in that case, if G2 is a TF, and both G1 and G3 are downstream, then knocking
