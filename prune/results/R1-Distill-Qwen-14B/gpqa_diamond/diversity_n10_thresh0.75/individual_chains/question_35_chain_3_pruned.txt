Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Hmm, let me try to unpack this step by step.

The question says that A_y is represented by a 2x2 matrix, and it's given as A_y = c·S, where c is h/(4π) and S is another 2x2 matrix. The matrix S has the first row as (0, -i) and the second row as (i, 0). I remember that in quantum mechanics, angular momentum operators are often proportional to Pauli matrices. Oh wait, the Pauli matrices! Let me recall them. The Pauli matrices are sigma_x, sigma_y, sigma_z. The sigma_y matrix is indeed [ [0, -i], [i, 0] ], so that's what S is. So S is sigma_y.

So the operator A_y is c times sigma_y. Since sigma_y is a 2x2 matrix, A_y would also be 2x2. Now, the task is to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A_y.

Eigenvalues of a matrix operator are found by solving the equation (A_y - λI)φ = 0, where λ is the eigenvalue and φ is the eigenvector. But wait, since A_y is proportional to sigma_y, which is a Pauli matrix, I remember that the eigenvalues of Pauli matrices are ±1. So sigma_y has eigenvalues +1 and -1.

So A_y = c * sigma_y. Therefore, the eigenvalues of A_y would be c * (+1) and c * (-1). Let's compute that. c is h/(4π), so the eigenvalues are (h/(4π)) * 1 and (h/(4π)) * (-1). So the eigenvalues are ±h/(4π).

Wait, but looking at the options, option A says the eigenvalues have imaginary parts ±2πh and real parts h/(4π) or -h/(4π). That doesn't make sense because in this case, the eigenvalues are purely real. Because A_y is a Hermitian operator since it's an angular momentum component, which should have real eigenvalues. So if the eigenvalues are ±h/(4π), which are real, then any option suggesting imaginary parts would be incorrect.

Looking at the options, option A says the
