Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about angular momentum operators. Hmm, the question is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator Ay. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the problem says that the operator Ay is equal to c multiplied by S, where c is h/(4π). And S is a 2x2 matrix given as the first row being (0, -i) and the second row (i, 0). So I need to write out what Ay looks like.

Let me compute c first. c is h/(4π), so I'll remember that. Now, S is a matrix: 

S = [[0, -i],
     [i, 0]]

So, Ay would be c multiplied by this matrix. Let me write that out:

Ay = (h/(4π)) * [[0, -i],
                [i, 0]]

Which becomes:

Ay = [[0, -i*(h/(4π))],
      [i*(h/(4π)), 0]]

Wait, but when I multiply the matrix S by c, each element of S is multiplied by c. So the elements are c*0, c*(-i), etc.

So Ay is:

[[0, (-i h)/(4π)],
 [ (i h)/(4π), 0]]

Now, to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. I remember that for a 2x2 matrix, the eigenvalues can be found by solving the characteristic equation det(Ay - aI) = 0, where a is the eigenvalue, and I is the identity matrix.

So let's set up the matrix (Ay - a I):

[ [ -a, (-i h)/(4π) ],
  [ (i h)/(4π), -a ] ]

The determinant of this matrix is (-a)(-a) - [ (-i h/(4π) ) * (i h/(4π)) ) ].

Calculating the determinant:

Determinant = a² - [ ( (-i)(i) (h²)/(16π²) ) ]
But (-i)(i) is (-i^2)= -(-1)=1, since i^2 is -1. So it's 1*(h²)/(16π²).

So determinant = a² - (h²)/(16π²) = 0.

Setting this equal to zero: a² = (h²)/(16π²)

Taking square roots: a = ± h/(4π)

So the eigenvalues are a = h/(4π) and a = -h/(4π).

Wait wait, but I thought that the eigenvalues for angular momentum components are multiples of ħ/2. Hmm, let me think. Oh wait, ħ is h/(2π). So h/(4π) is ħ/2. So yeah, the eigenvalues are ± ħ/2. So that's correct.

So the eigenvalues are real numbers, right? Each is a real number, either h/(4π) or -h/(4π). So the statement about the imaginary parts doesn't make sense unless I'm missing something.

Looking at the options:

Option A says the imaginary part of the eigenvalue is ±2πh, and the real parts are ±h/(4π). But wait, the eigenvalues I found are real. So their imaginary parts are zero, which doesn't match option A. So probably option A is wrong.

Option B says imaginary parts are ±1/2, real parts ±1. Hmm, that doesn't match either because I found real eigenvalues. So B is wrong.

Options C and D: I need to think about those.

Option C says the eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. Well, I remember that for angular momentum, the eigenfunctions of any component are eigenfunctions of the square of the angular momentum (since L² commutes with each component). So if Ay and Az don't commute, then eigenfunctions of Ay may not be eigenfunctions of Az, but they should be eigenfunctions of A².

Wait, but the operator Ay is a component
