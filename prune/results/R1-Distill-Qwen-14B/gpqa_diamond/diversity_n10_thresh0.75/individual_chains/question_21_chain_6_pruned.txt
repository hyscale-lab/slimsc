Alright, so I've got this chemistry question here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's break it down.

The question is about isomers, specifically constitutional and stereoisomers. But the main parts are about two separate things: compound A, which doesn't show tautomerism, and compound B, which shows optical isomerism. Then we have to pick which option correctly assigns A and B from the given choices.

First, let's tackle part A: which compound doesn't show tautomerism.

The options are benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione.

Wait, what's tautomerism again? Tautomerism is when a compound can shift between different structures (tautomer forms) through the movement of a hydrogen atom and a shift in the double bond. This usually occurs in compounds with adjacent double bonds or conjugated systems, allowing the hydrogen to move and the bonds to reorganize.

Benzoquinone is a quinone structure, right? Quinones have two ketone groups connected by a conjugated double bond system. Specifically, benzoquinone is 1,4-benzoquinone, which has two ketone groups opposite each other on a benzene ring. Does it have any possibility for tautomerism?

Wait, tautomerism usually involves a hydrogen moving from one atom to another, causing a shift in double bonds. In benzoquinone, the structure is rigid. Let me visualize it: the benzene ring with two ketones at positions 1 and 4. Are there any alpha hydrogens adjacent to the carbonyl groups? Because for tautomerism to occur, like in a diketone, you need adjacent carbonyls with alpha hydrogens.

Wait, benzoquinone is O=C6H4=O. So each ketone is on the benzene ring, but the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl (the ring carbons) are each connected to two other ring carbons and an oxygen. So, wait, each of those carbons is part of the ring, so they can't have hydrogens attached to the carbonyl? Or do they?

Wait, the benzene ring has alternating double bonds. So in 1,4-benzoquinone, the structure is O=C6H4=O, which would have two ketone groups. The ring is fully conjugated, so each carbon is bonded to two others. But the carbons adjacent to the carbonyls (like the positions ortho and para) are each attached to two ring carbons, so perhaps they don't have hydrogens attached to them. Or maybe they do, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I should think about cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. That's a six-membered ring (cyclohexane) with three ketone groups at positions 1,3,5. So the structure is O=C-(CH2) around the ring, but with three ketone groups.

Wait, no. 1,3,5-trione would have ketone groups at each of those positions. So, each of those positions is a carbonyl, connected to adjacent CH2 groups.

In that structure, each carbonyl is separated by a methylene group (CH2), right? So, for example, positions 1, 3, and 5 are carbonyls, and positions 2,4,6 are CH2.

So, the molecule would have three ketone groups. Now, for tautomerism, you need conjugated carbonyl groups with alpha hydrogens. In cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, each ketone is separated by a single bond from another ketone. So perhaps this creates conjugation, but do the alpha positions have hydrogens?

Wait, the alpha carbon is the one adjacent to the carbonyl. So each ketone is at position 1,3,5. The alpha carbons would be the ones next to each ketone. So for position 1, the alpha carbons are positions 6 and 2. Each of those would be CH2 groups.

So, each of these alpha positions would have two hydrogens each. So, in 1,3,5-trione, the carbonyl groups are conjugated through the ring. So perhaps the molecule can undergo tautomerism, shifting a hydrogen from one alpha position to another.

Wait, but wait: in such a trione, maybe the molecule can form enol tautomers. Enol forms involve the movement of a hydrogen from a carbon adjacent to a carbonyl to another, forming a double bond. So if each of these has alpha hydrogens, then the compound can tautomerize.

But benzoquinone: is that possible? Let's think about 1,4-benzoquinone. Each ketone is on the benzene ring, as O=C-C6H4-C=O. The adjacent carbons (ortho) are each part of the ring. So, the carbons next to the carbonyl are the ring carbons, which are double-bonded to each other. So those ring carbons don't have any hydrogen atoms attached because each is part of the conjugated system.

Wait, the benzene ring is fully conjugated, so each ring carbon is bonded to two other ring carbons, and each is either connected to an oxygen (as in the ketone) or not. So, for benzoquinone, the carbonyl groups are on positions 1 and 4, and positions 2,3,5,6 are part of the ring. But the ring carbons at positions 2 and 3 are double-bonded (as in the ring), so they don't have any hydrogens attached because all their
