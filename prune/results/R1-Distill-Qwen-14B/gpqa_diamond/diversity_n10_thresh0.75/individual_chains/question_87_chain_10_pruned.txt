Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me read it carefully. The question is about identifying the correct 1H NMR data for a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound with 8 carbons in total. The FTIR shows peaks for a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step.

First, let me break down the information given. The compound is a di-substituted benzene ring (6-membered aromatic). So that's six carbons in the ring. But wait, the total is 8 carbons. So the substituents must add up to 2 more carbons. Oh, wait, but wait—what substituents are present?

The IR has a carbonyl group. Carbonyl is a C=O. So one substituent could be a ketone, or maybe an ester or something else with a carbonyl. Also, there's an aromatic-halogen bond. So another substituent is a halogen, probably Cl, Br, etc., attached to the benzene ring.

So, the benzene has two substituents: one is a carbonyl group (like a ketone, maybe an acyl group?), and the other is a halogen. Let's think about the structure. Di-substituted benzene rings can have substituents in different positions—ortho, meta, para. But more importantly, the substituents here are a halogen and a carbonyl group.

Wait, another possibility: the carbonyl could be part of a substituent like an acetyphenone group. For example, benzophenone has a ketone attached to the benzene. But in our case, it's a di-substituted ring. So maybe the substituents are a carbonyl group (like acetyl) and a halogen.

Wait, but let's think about the molecular formula. The benzene ring has six carbons. Two substituents adding two more carbons. So each substituent could be one carbon each, but wait, a carbonyl group like -CO- might come from a substituent that's more than one carbon. For example, an acetyl group is -COCH3. That's three carbons (the CO and two from CH3). Wait, but wait, the total carbons in the molecule are 8. So benzene (6) plus substituents. Let me see: substituent 1 is, say, -COCH3 (which is 2 carbons: the CO is attached to a CH3). Wait, no, that's 3 carbons (COCH3). So substituent 1 is 3 carbons, substituent 2 is 1 carbon (like Cl). Wait, but 3 + 1 = 4, plus 6 in the ring would make 10. That's too many. Hmm, maybe I'm thinking this wrong.

Wait, the total is 8 carbons. So 6 in the ring, plus substituents. Each substituent can be a single carbon or more. Let me think: if substituent A is X (where X is a halogen, which is one atom but doesn't add carbon), and substituent B is a carbonyl group, perhaps as an acetyl group (COCH3). Wait,
