Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question says that particles are collided in a spherical detector. New particles are produced, and they travel at ultra-relativistic velocities with a Lorentz factor of about 20. On average, one third of these particles reach the inner walls of the detector. The radius is 30 meters. Now, they're asking what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of the particles reach the inner walls.

Hmm. So, I think this has to do with the time it takes for the particles to reach the detector walls and whether they decay before that. Lorentz factor relates to time dilation and length contraction in relativity, right?

Wait, ultra-relativistic particles have a high gamma (Lorentz factor). Gamma is given by gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So higher gamma means higher velocity.

The particles decay, and the faster they are, the more time they have before reaching the detector walls. But if they decay quickly, maybe they don't make it. So the fraction that reaches the walls depends on the time it takes for them to reach the walls versus their lifetime.

Wait, but in the first scenario, one third reach the walls. So, that must mean that the particles are decaying before they reach the walls. So the average lifetime of the particles must be such that only a fraction get there before decaying.

But how does the Lorentz factor relate to the fraction? Let's think about it.

In the lab frame (detector frame), the particle's lifetime is dilated by gamma. So the lifetime τ in the lab frame is gamma multiplied by the proper lifetime τ0. So τ_lab = gamma * τ0.

The time it takes for the particle to reach the wall is the distance divided by the speed. Since the particles are traveling at ultra-relativistic speeds, v is approximately c. So the time t is radius / v. Since v ≈ c, t = R / c.

So R is 30 meters. Let me calculate that. The speed of light is approximately 3e8 meters per second. So t = 30 / (3e8) = 1e-7 seconds. So 0.1 microseconds.

Wait, but the particle's lifetime is gamma * tau_0. So the particle will
