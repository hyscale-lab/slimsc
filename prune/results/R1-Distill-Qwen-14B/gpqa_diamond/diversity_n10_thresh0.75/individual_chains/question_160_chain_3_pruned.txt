Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it's about an aperture shaped like an N-sided polygon. All the apothems are of the same length 'a'. Monochromatic light is shining vertically on it, and we're supposed to find the angular distance between the first two minima in the far field when N is infinitely large. Oh wait, that probably means the polygon becomes a circle when N approaches infinity, right? Because a polygon with infinite sides is a smooth shape, like a circle.

So the problem is about diffraction, I think. When light passes through an aperture, it diffracts and creates a pattern of maxima and minima on a screen. The question is about the angle between the first two minima in this pattern.

Wait, but when the aperture is a circle, the diffraction pattern is the familiar single-slit diffraction pattern, with a central maximum and then alternating minima and maxima. The first minima occur at certain angles. But wait, the question is about the angular distance between the first two minima. Does that mean the zeros of the diffraction pattern?

Wait, in single-slit diffraction, the minima occur at angles θ where a sinθ = m λ, where m is an integer (m=1,2,3...). The first minimum is at m=1, the second at m=2, and so on. The angular distance between the first two minima would then be the angle between m=1 and m=2, which is the difference in their θ values.

But wait, the problem says N is infinitely large, so the aperture is a circle. So the setup is similar to a single-slit diffraction. So the formula for the minima is a sinθ = mλ. But since the angles are small, sinθ is approximately θ (in radians), so aθ ≈ mλ.

So the first minimum is at θ1 = λ/(a), and the second at θ2 = 2λ/(a). The angular distance between them is θ2 - θ1 = (2λ/a) - (λ/a) = λ/a. But wait, that's not matching any of the options. The options are fractions of λ/a.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Because the first two minima are at m=1 and m=2, but maybe the angular spacing isn
