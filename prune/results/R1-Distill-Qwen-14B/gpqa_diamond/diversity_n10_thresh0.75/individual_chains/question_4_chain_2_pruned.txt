Okay, so I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about Maxwell's equations in a parallel universe where magnets can have isolated North or South poles. Hmm, I remember that in our universe, magnets always have both a North and South pole; you can't isolate them. But how does that affect Maxwell's equations?

Maxwell's equations are four fundamental laws of electromagnetism. I think they are:

1. Gauss's Law for Electricity: ∇·E = ρ/ε₀
2. Gauss's Law for Magnetism: ∇·B = 0
3. Faraday's Law of Induction: ∇×E = -∂B/∂t
4. Ampère's Law with Maxwell's addition: ∇×B = μ₀ J + μ₀ ε₀ ∂E/∂t

In our universe, the second equation says that the divergence of B is zero. That's because magnetic monopoles don't exist. So if in this parallel universe, magnets can have isolated poles, that must mean magnetic monopoles exist there. How does that change the equations?

If magnetic monopoles exist, then the divergence of B wouldn't be zero anymore. Because with a monopole, say a point with a 'north' magnetic charge, the field lines would originate from it, similar to how electric fields come from positive charges. So ∇·B would equal some function of the magnetic charge density, maybe ρ_m or something. So equation 2 of Maxwell's would change.

Wait, but what about the other equations? Let's think. Faraday's Law (equation 3) relates the curl of E to the time derivative of B. If B now has sources (monopoles), does that affect Faraday's Law? I'm not sure... Or does it change another equation?

Oh wait, I think in the presence of magnetic monopoles, the symmetry between electric and magnetic fields is broken. So not only does the divergence of B change, but maybe the curl of E also changes. Because in the standard equations, the divergence of E is related to electric charge, and the divergence of B is zero. If B can have divergence, that opens up another possibility.

Wait, Faraday's Law as it is says that the curl of E is negative the time derivative of B. But if B has sources, maybe the equation needs to account for that. Or perhaps another equation?

Alternatively, I remember that if magnetic monopoles exist, then Maxwell's equations would have to be modified in two places. Because in our equations, the divergence of B is zero (equation 2), and the curl of E is only about the time change of B (equation 3). If we have monopoles, equation 2 would change, but also equation 3 might have a source term added.

Wait, perhaps the symmetry is that the four equations would mirror each other. For electric charges, we have ∇·E = ρ/ε₀. If we have magnetic charges, then ∇·B would be μ (some term for magnetic charge density). Similarly, the Faraday equation would have an additional term. Let me think: Faraday's equation would then have ∇×E = -∂B/∂t - (maybe something else).

Alternatively, perhaps another approach: Maxwell's equations in a theory with magnetic monopoles would have both ∇·B and ∇×E modified.

In the standard equations:

∇·B = 0 → with monopoles, this becomes ∇·B = μ_0 ρ_m (where ρ_m is the magnetic charge density).

And the Faraday equation, which is ∇×E = -∂B/∂t, would become ∇×E = -∂B/∂t - μ_0 J_m (where J_m is the magnetic current density). Because in the presence of magnetic currents, the induced electric fields would be different.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing things up. Let me recall, when you have magnetic monopoles, the modified Maxwell's equations would be:

1. ∇·E = ρ_e / ε_0
2. ∇·B = ρ_m μ_0
3. ∇×E = - ∂B/∂t - μ_0 J_m
4. ∇×B = μ_0 ε_0 ∂E/∂t + μ_0 J_e

Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The original Ampère's law includes the displacement current, and if we add magnetic currents, perhaps the equations change.

I think the key is that in a universe with magnetic monopoles, two of Maxwell's equations change. The ones that involve the divergence of B and the curl of E.

So looking back at the question: which equations are different?

The options are:

A) The one related to the divergence of the magnetic field. → So just equation 2.

But I'm pretty sure that both equation 2 and equation 3 change. Because equation 2 would have a non-zero divergence, and equation 3 would have an extra term related to the magnetic current.

So
