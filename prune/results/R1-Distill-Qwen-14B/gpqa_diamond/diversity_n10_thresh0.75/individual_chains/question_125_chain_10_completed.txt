Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem to solve. Let me read through it again and try to figure it out step by step.

The question is about a particle in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential. The potential is given by V(r) = (1/2) m ω² r², which I remember from my studies is a harmonic oscillator potential. The force here obeys Hooke's law, which makes sense because F = -k r, and in this case, k would be m ω².

The question asks for two things: the energy of the third excited state and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions possible for that energy eigenvalue.

Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the energy levels for a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator are quantized. The energy levels depend on the quantum numbers in each direction, but since it's isotropic, all directions are the same. The energy levels are given by E = ħω(n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2 ), where n_x, n_y, and n_z are non-negative integers (0,1,2,...).

Wait, but in 3D, the energy is often expressed in terms of the total quantum number n, where n = n_x + n_y + n_z. So another way to write the energy is E = ħω(n + 3/2).

So the possible energy levels are E_0 = (3/2) ħω (ground state), E_1 = (5/2) ħω, E_2 = (7/2) ħω, and so on. Each increment in n by 1 increases the energy by ħω.

Wait, but the question is about the third excited state. The ground state is n=0. So first excited state is n=1, second is n=2, and third is n=3. So the energy for the third excited state would be E_3 = (3 + 3/2) ħω = (9/2) ħω. So that would be (9/2) ħω. Looking at the options, that's option A and C.

Now, the second part is about the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions with that energy. Oh right, because for a given n, the degeneracy is the number of ways you can have n_x + n_y + n_z = n. For n=3, how many combinations are there?

Let me think. The number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for a given n is (n + 2 choose 2), which is (n+2)(n+1)/2. Wait, no, wait. For 3D, the degeneracy is (n + 2)(n + 1)/2? Or is it (n + 1)(n + 2)/2? Wait, no, wait. Let me think of small n values. For n=0: only (0,0,0), so 1 function. For n=1: possible combinations are (1,0,0), (0,1,0), (0,0,1). So 3 functions. For n=2: how many? Let's see, all permutations where the sum is 2. The possible triples are (2,0,0), (0,2,0), (0,0,2), (1,1,0), (1,0,1), (0,1,1). That's 6 functions.

So for n=3, the degeneracy is the number of non-negative integer solutions to a + b + c =3. The formula for that is (3 + 3 -1 choose 3-1) ) = (5 choose 2) = 10. So for n=3, there are 10 eigenfunctions.

So putting it together, the energy is (9/2) ħω, and the number of eigenfunctions is 10. Looking at the options, option A says that: (9/2) ħω, 10.

What about the other options? Option B and D have energy terms with pi squared and 1/r squared, which doesn't fit the harmonic oscillator energy formula. So they're probably not correct. Option C says 3 functions, which would be for n=1 or n=2, but the third excited state is n=3, so 10 functions. So the correct answer must be option A.


The problem involves a quantum mechanical system of a particle of mass \( m \) in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential \( V(r) = \frac{1}{2} m \omega^2 r^2 \). The energy levels for such a system are quantized and given by \( E = \hbar \omega (n + \frac{3}{2}) \), where \( n = n_x + n_y + n_z \) is the total quantum number, and \( n_x, n_y, n_z \) are non-negative integers representing quantum numbers in the \( x \), \( y \), and \( z \) directions, respectively.

The question asks for the energy of the third excited state and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions corresponding to that energy eigenvalue. 

1. **Energy of the Third Excited State**:  
   The ground state corresponds to \( n = 0 \), the first excited state to \( n = 1 \), the second excited state to \( n = 2 \), and the third excited state to \( n = 3 \). Substituting \( n = 3 \) into the energy formula, the energy is:  
   \[
   E = \hbar \omega \left(3 + \frac{3}{2}\right) = \frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega.
   \]

2. **Number of Linearly Independent Eigenfunctions**:  
   For a given \( n \), the degeneracy (number of linearly independent eigenfunctions) is the number of non-negative integer solutions to \( n_x + n_y + n_z = n \). This is given by the combinatorial formula:  
   \[
   \text{Degeneracy} = \binom{n + 3 - 1}{3 - 1} = \binom{n + 2}{2}.
   \]  
   For \( n = 3 \), the degeneracy is:  
   \[
   \binom{3 + 2}{2} = \binom{5}{2} = 10.
   \]

3. **Analysis of Options**:  
   - **Option A**: \( \frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega, 10 \) matches the calculated energy and degeneracy.  
   - **Option B**: The energy term \( \frac{11 \pi^2 \hbar^2}{2 m r^2} \) does not correspond to the harmonic oscillator energy formula and is incorrect.  
   - **Option C**: While the energy \( \frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega \) is correct, the degeneracy \( 3 \) corresponds to a lower \( n \) (e.g., \( n = 1 \) or \( n = 2 \)), not \( n = 3 \).  
   - **Option D**: The energy term \( \frac{11 \pi^2 \hbar^2}{2 m r^2} \) is incorrect, as is the degeneracy \( 3 \).  

Thus, the correct answer is **Option A**.  

Answer: A
