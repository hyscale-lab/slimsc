Okay, so I've got this NMR problem to solve. Hmm, the question is about identifying an unknown organic compound from its 1H NMR data. The options are between four compounds: two propenyl acetates and two butenyl acetates, both cis and trans versions. 

Let me think. I remember that NMR can reveal a lot about the structure, especially the splitting patterns and chemical shifts. The given data is:

7.0 ppm (1H, d, J=16.0 Hz)
5.5 ppm (1H, dq)
2.1 ppm (3H, s)
1.6 ppm (3H, d)

So, first, I should probably figure out what each of these signals corresponds to. Let's break them down.

The singlet at 2.1 ppm with 3H is likely a methyl group attached to an oxygen, maybe an acetate group. Because in acetates, the methyl is usually around 2 ppm as a singlet. So that's probably the OAc group.

The doublet at 7.0 ppm, integrating to 1H, with a coupling constant J=16 Hz. A doublet suggests it's coupled to one neighboring proton. High coupling like 16 Hz makes me think of an allylic system or maybe a trans coupling in a double bond. Because in trans alkenes, the coupling between protons on adjacent carbons can be around 16 Hz, right? Wait, actually, I think that in allylic positions, the coupling can be trans, but maybe I'm mixing that up. Alternatively, that could be a vinyl proton adjacent to an oxygen, but that might have a different shift.

The 5.5 ppm signal is a doublet of quartets (dq), 1H. Hmm, doublet of quartets suggests that this proton is coupled to two different sets of protons. Let's think about where that could happen. Maybe in a vinyl group where the proton is adjacent to two different environments. Like, for example, in a propenyl or butenyl group attached to an ester.

The 1.6 ppm doublet with 3H. That's probably a methyl group attached to something, maybe a CH2 group. Since it's a doublet, it must be coupled to one neighboring proton. So perhaps it's part of a CH2CH2 or similar structure adjacent to another CH.

Putting this together, the molecule is likely an acetate ester with an allyl or propenyl group. The options are propenyl and butenyl. Let me recall: propenyl is CH2CHCH2, but wait no, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-. Wait, no, wait. Propenyl acetate would be CH2CH2COOCH3? No, wait, acetate is OAc. So the ester would be R-O-CO-OCH3? Wait, no, wait, wait. No, the ester group is O-CO-O, but the structure is R-O-CO-O-R', but in this case, it's probably something like CH2CH2COOCH3? Hmm, maybe I should think about the structure of propenyl acetate and butenyl acetate.

Wait, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-OAc. But wait, the structure would be CH2CH2-O-COCH3? No, wait, the ester would be the R group attached to the oxygen, so for propenyl acetate, it's CH2CHCH2-O-COCH3? Wait, no, because propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-, but as an ester, it would be CH2=CHCH2-O-CO-R, but wait, acetate is OAc, so R is methyl. So the structure is CH2=CHCH2-O-CO-Me.

Wait, but if that's the case, the NMR would have protons from the CH2=CHCH2 group. So the protons on the double bond would show up in the 5-6 ppm region.

Let me think about the splitting in the NMR. The 7.0 ppm peak is a
