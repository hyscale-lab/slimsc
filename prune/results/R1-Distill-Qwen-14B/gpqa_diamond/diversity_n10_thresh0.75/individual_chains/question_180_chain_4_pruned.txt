Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The question is about finding the minimum energy of a system with charges. So, there are 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. The mass is negligible, so I probably don't have to worry about kinetic energy or anything like that. 

Wait, the setup is that 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. Hmm, so the 13th is at the center, and the other 12 are all at the same distance from it. 

I remember that in electrostatics, the potential energy of a system of point charges is the sum of the potential energies of each pair. Oh yeah, the formula is U = (k * q1 * q2) / r for each pair. But since there are multiple charges, I have to calculate all the interactions. 

Let me break it down. The 13th charge is fixed at P, and the others are at 2 meters away. So each of the 12 charges will interact with the 13th. Also, each of the 12 charges will interact with each other. So there are two contributions to the potential energy here: the energy between the 13th and each of the 12, and the energy between each pair of the 12 charges.

Wait, but since the 12 charges are identical and fixed at the same distance from P, their arrangement is symmetric. So maybe the potential energy from the interactions among themselves can be calculated using a formula I remember. 

First, let's think about the energy between the 13th charge and each of the 12. The 13th charge is fixed, so each of the 12 is interacting with it. The charge of each is 2e. So what's the potential energy for each of these interactions?

Each pair (13th and another charge) contributes (k * (2e) * (2e)) / (2m). Because each charge is 2e, and the distance is 2 meters. 

Wait, but how many such pairs are there? There are 12. So the total energy from this part is 12 * (k * (2e)^2) / (2m). 

Then, for the interactions between
