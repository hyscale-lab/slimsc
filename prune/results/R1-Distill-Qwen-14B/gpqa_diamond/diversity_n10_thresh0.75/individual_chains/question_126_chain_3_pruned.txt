Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see, the question is about two reactions and the products formed, and then how they behave in different HPLC columns.

First, Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is treated with LAH followed by an acidic workup. LAH is a strong reducing agent, right? It's LiAlH4, which typically reduces ketones to secondary alcohols. Wait, but the starting material is a ketone at position 3. So, hexan-3-one would become hexan-3-ol after reduction. But wait, there's a methoxy group at position 5. Oh, but methoxy (OCH3) is an ether group. Does that affect the reduction? I think LAH would reduce the ketone regardless of the substituents.

So Reaction I would take (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one and reduce the ketone to an alcohol. So the structure would be 3-hydroxy-5-methoxyhexane. Wait, no, because the starting molecule is 5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So the reduction would change the 3-ketone to a 3-hydroxyl group. But wait, LAH is such a strong reducing agent. So yes, that's correct. So the product of Reaction I is 3-hydroxy-5-methoxyhexane. And since the starting material was (S) configuration at the chiral center (the 5-methoxy is on the same carbon as the ketone?), wait no, the starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. Let me see: hexan-3-one is (CH2)2CO(CH2)3CH3. Wait, no. Hexan-3-one is CH2CH2C(O)CH2CH2CH3? Wait, maybe not. Let's structure it.

The structure: hexan-3-one is CH2CH2(CO)CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, hexan-3-one is (CH2)2CO(CH2)3- but wait, hexane is six carbons. So position 3 is the third carbon. So, CH3CH2COCH2CH2CH3? No, wait, that
