Okay, so I've got this physics problem about the speed of light in a moving medium. Hmm, I remember that when dealing with light moving through a medium like glass, the speed is affected by the refractive index. But wait, the glass itself is moving. How does that play into it?

The question says a light beam is moving through glass with index n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer. I need to find the speed of the light relative to the observer in the lab frame.

Wait, so the glass is moving towards the observer. And the light is also moving in the same direction as the glass. So from the lab frame, the light is moving through the moving glass. Hmm, but how do velocities add up here?

I'm a bit rusty on this. Let me think about the basics. The speed of light in a medium is v = c/n, right? So in the glass's rest frame, the speed of the light is c/n. But since the glass is moving, we need to apply a velocity transformation.

Wait, but how does that work? Oh wait, in special relativity, velocities don't just add up linearly. The velocity addition formula comes into play. Oh right, when you have two frames moving relative to each other, you can't just add the velocities directly.

So the formula is: u' = (u - v)/(1 - (u*v)/(cÂ²)), but wait, I'm a bit confused about the direction. Let me clarify.

In the glass's frame, the light is moving at u = c/n. But the glass
