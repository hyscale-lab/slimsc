Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. Hmm, right, I remember that when light travels through a medium like glass, its speed changes based on the refractive index. But wait, the glass itself is moving, so that complicates things.

The problem states that a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the laboratory. We need to find the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer. Oh, and the speed of light in a vacuum is given as c=1, so that's helpful.

Wait, the speed of light in the glass when it's stationary is c/n, right? Because the formula is v = c/n. So if the glass isn't moving, the speed would just be 1/n since c is 1.

But now the glass is moving. So this is a scenario where we have to consider the relative motion of the medium and the light. Hmm, I remember something about how when a medium is moving, the speed of light as measured in the lab frame isn't simply v_medium plus the speed in the medium. Or is it? Or maybe it's more complicated.

Wait, no, I think it's about adding velocities when considering different reference frames. Like, in special relativity, velocities don't just add up linearly because of the velocity addition formulas. But wait, this problem is probably in the realm of classical mechanics because it's about light in a medium, and maybe using the relativistic approach isn't necessary here. Or maybe I'm wrong.

Wait, the question is about the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer. So the glass is moving towards the observer at velocity v in the same direction as the light beam. Wait, same direction as the beam? Or is the beam moving in the same direction as the glass's motion?

Wait, the glass is moving towards the observer and in the same direction as the beam. So the beam is going towards the observer, and the glass is moving towards the observer too. So the beam is moving forward in the same direction as the glass's movement.

So the question is about the observed speed of the light in the glass when the glass is moving. So, if the glass is moving at speed v (towards the observer, so maybe in the positive direction), and the light inside the glass is moving at
