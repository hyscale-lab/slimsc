Okay, I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure out the ratio of silicon atoms in two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I'll read the question carefully again. So, both stars have masses of 1.5 and 1.2 times the Sun's mass. But wait, I don't think the mass plays a direct role in the elemental abundances unless maybe in stellar evolution, but the problem says to use the Equivalent Width (EW) method under LTE. So I guess the masses might not be needed here, or maybe it's just extra info.

The given abundances are [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex and [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex. Also, [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex and [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex. Oh, right, the brackets mean logarithmic abundances relative to hydrogen. So, for example, [Fe/H] of 0 means the iron abundance is the same as in the Sun.

The Sun's photospheric composition is given as 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5, and similarly 12 + log10(nMg/nH) =7. I think that means log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5, and same for Mg: log10(nMg/nH)=7-12= -5. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the formula is 12 + log(nX/nH) equals a number. So for Fe, 12 + log(nFe/nH) =7.5 → log(nFe/nH) =7.5-12 = -4.5. So nFe/nH is 10^(-4.5). Similarly, Mg is 10^(-5) because 12 + log(nMg/nH) =7 → log= -5.

So I need to find the ratio [nSi_1 / nSi_2], I think. The question says the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So, [nSi_1 / nSi_2] in their atmospheres.

Let me think about the steps. I need to find the silicon to
