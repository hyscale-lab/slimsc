Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. Hmm, I need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. Let me try to think through this step by step.

First, the problem says we start with 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. So, the initial concentration will change because we're diluting it. Right, because when you add more solvent, the concentration decreases.

Wait, the formula for dilution is M1V1 = M2V2. So M1 is 0.05 M, V1 is 20 cm³. After adding 20 cm³, the total volume becomes 40 cm³. So M2 would be (0.05 * 20) / 40. Let me calculate that: 0.05 *20 is 1, divided by 40 is 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Then, we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH. The question is about 25% titration and the equivalence point.

Wait, so the equivalence point is when all the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH. But the 25% titration is a quarter of that volume added. I'm a bit confused about what 25% refers to—maybe 25% of the volume required to reach the equivalence point?

Let me think. The equivalence point occurs when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid. So, let's calculate the moles of acetic acid in the diluted solution.

Original volume after dilution is 40 cm³ (0.04 L). Moles of acetic acid (CH3COOH) would be Molarity * Volume in liters. So 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 moles. So, 0.001 moles of CH3COOH.

Since each mole of NaOH reacts with one mole of CH3COOH, the moles of NaOH needed at equivalence would be 0.001 moles. The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, so the volume
