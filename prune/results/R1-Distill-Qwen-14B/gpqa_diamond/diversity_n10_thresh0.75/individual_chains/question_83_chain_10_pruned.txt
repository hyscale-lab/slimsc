Okay, so I have this chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says. Hmm. We're dealing with an acetic acid solution that's being diluted and then titrated with NaOH. I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and when it's titrated with a strong base like NaOH, it forms acetate ions. 

The problem states that we have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid, and it's diluted with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then, we titrate this solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point.

First, I think I should calculate the initial concentration of the acetic acid after dilution. Oh wait, right, dilution formula: M1V1 = M2V2. So M2 is (0.05 M * 20 cm³) / 40 cm³. Because 20 cm³ of acid + 20 cm³ of water = 40 cm³ total. So M2 is (0.05 * 20) / 40 = (1) / 40 = 0.0125 M. Wait, 0.05 *20 is 1 mmol, and 40 cm³ is 0.04 L. So 1 mmol / 0.04 L is 0.025 M? Wait, wait, wait, let me recalculate. Oh wait, 0.05 M is 0.05 mol/dm³. 20 cm³ is 0.02 dm³. So moles of acetic acid is 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 mol. Diluted into 40 cm³, which is 0.04 dm³. So concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Oh I see, I messed up the initial calculation. So the diluted solution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Next, when titrating with 0.1 M NaOH. The equivalence point is when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid. Let me calculate the volume needed for equivalence. Moles of acetic acid are 0.001 mol. Moles of NaOH needed is also 0.001. Since NaOH is 0.1 M, the volume is (0.001 mol) / (0.1 mol/dm³) = 0.01 dm³, which is 10 cm³. So at equivalence, 10 cm³ of NaOH is added.

But the question asks about 25% titration. So that's 25% of the equivalence volume. 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³. So when 2.5 cm³ of NaOH has been added.

Wait, but wait, wait. Let me think. The equivalence point is when all the acetic acid is neutralized. So 25% titration would mean that 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH. So the moles of NaOH added would be 0.25 * 0.001 mol = 0.00025 mol. Since NaOH is 0.1 M, the volume is 0.00025 / 0.1 = 0.0025 dm³ = 2.5 cm³. So yeah, that's correct.

Now, for each of these points, I need to find the pH.

First, let's tackle the pH at 25% titration. At this point, some of the acetic acid has been converted into acetate ions. So the solution is a buffer solution. I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation here.

The initial moles of acetic acid were 0.001 mol. When we add 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH, which is 0.00025 mol, it will react with acetic acid. So the reaction is:

CH3COOH + OH- → CH3COO^- + H2O.

So, moles of CH3COOH remaining: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol.

Moles of CH3COO^- formed: 0.00025 mol.

So the solution after adding 2.5 cm³ NaOH has a total volume of 40 cm³ + 2.5 cm³ = 42.5 cm³ or
