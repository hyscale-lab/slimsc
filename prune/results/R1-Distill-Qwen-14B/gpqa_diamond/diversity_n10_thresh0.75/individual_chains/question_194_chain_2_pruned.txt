Okay, so I've got this problem about partition functions for a system of three spins. Hmm, each spin can be +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J [S1 S2 + S1 S3 + S2 S3]. I need to find the partition function Z.

Wait, partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of exp(-beta E), right? Oh wait, no, wait. The formula is Z = sum_{states} exp(-beta E_i), where E_i is the energy of each state. Wait, sometimes I've seen it as exp(-E/(kT)), but since beta is 1/(kT), it's exp(-beta E).

So each spin S can be +1 or -1. There are three spins, so total of 2^3 = 8 possible states. But maybe there's symmetry that can reduce the number of terms I need to calculate.

The energy depends on the products of each pair. Let me think: for each pair, S_i S_j is +1 if they're the same, -1 if they're different.

Wait, E = -J (S1 S2 + S1 S3 + S2 S3). So for each term S_i S_j, when they're the same, the product is +1, contributing +1 to the sum inside. But multiplied by -J, so each same pair gives -J * (+1) = -J. Wait, wait no: the sum is S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3. So each term is either +1 or -1. So the total sum can be:

Let me think about all possible scenarios.

Each spin is binary, so each state is a combination of +1 and -1 for S1, S2, S3. Let's list all possible states and compute E for each, then see how many states have the same E.

Wait, maybe that's a bit tedious, but manageable. Alternatively, perhaps group states by the number of matching pairs or something.

Alternatively, let's think about all possible states and compute E for each. Let me list all 8 possibilities:

1. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=+1.
Then S1S2=1, S1S3=1, S2S3=1. Sum is 3. So E = -J*(3) = -3J.

2. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1.
S1S2=1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1. Sum is 1 -1 -1 = -1. So E = -J*(-1) = J.

3. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1.
S1S2=-1, S1S3=1, S2S3=-1. Sum is -1 +1 -1 = -1. E = J.

4. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1.
S1S2=-1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=1. Sum is -1 -1 +1 = -1. E= J.

5. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=+1.
S1S2=-1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=1. Sum is -1 -1 +1 =-1. E= J.

6. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=-1.
S1S2=-1, S1S3=1, S2S3=-1. Sum is -1 +1 -1 =-1. E= J.

7. S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=+1.
S1S2=1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1. Sum is 1 -1 -1 =-1. E= J.

8. S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=-1.
S1S2=1, S1S3=1, S2S3=1.
