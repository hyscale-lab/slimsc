Okay, I've got this problem in front of me, and I need to figure out which compound corresponds to the given spectroscopic data. Let's see, the molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Hmm, that's a good starting point. So, the molecular formula can give me some clues about the structure. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, C is 9, H is 11, X is 0, N is 1. So, (2*9 +2 -11 -0 +1)/2 = (20-11)/2 = 9/2=4.5? Wait, wait, that can't be right. Oh wait, maybe I miscalculated. Let me try again. 2C is 18, plus 2 is 20. Minus H (11) is 9. Plus N (since each N is considered as adding +1 for the formula, but wait, the formula is C9H11NO2. So, yeah, the formula for degree of unsaturation is: Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU) = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Wait, but in the formula, each N is treated as a -1, because in the molecular formula, it's like counting valence. Hmmm, maybe it's DoU = (2C +2 - H - X)/2 + (N) - (O). Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think. Alternatively, the formula can be broken down into rings and double bonds. Each ring or double bond is one DoU. Each triple bond is two, etc.

Wait, perhaps using the formula: DoU = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, X is 0, so 2*9 +2 =20. 20-11=9. Plus N=1, so 10. 10/2=5. So DoU is 5. That's five degrees of unsaturation, which could be, for example, a benzene ring (which is 3 DoU), a double bond (1), and two rings or another double bond, but that's a bit high. Alternatively, maybe a benzene ring plus an amide group (which has a double bond in the carbonyl). Let me think: Benzene (3 DoU), carbonyl group (1 DoU), and maybe an amide or ester group. So that's 4, but we have a DoU of 5. Wait, perhaps a benzamide structure which includes the benzene and an amide group (so 3 + 1 =4), and then maybe a double bond elsewhere or a ring. Hmm, not sure yet.

Now, looking at the IR data: strong to medium bands at 3420 and 3325 cm-1. Those are probably N-H stretches. Amide groups have N-H stretches in that region. Also, the strong band at 1720 cm-1 is indicative of a carbonyl group, like an ester or amide. Ester carbonyls are typically around 1720-1740 cm-1, while amides are a bit lower, but it depends. Amide I bands are usually around 1650 cm-1, but maybe the given value is due to something else? Or maybe it's an ester.

Looking at the 1H NMR data:

1.20 ppm, triplet, 3H. That's likely a CH2CH3 group. The triplet suggests coupling with a CH2 group, so maybe an ethyl group. So something like -OCH2CH3 or -CH2CH2-.

Then, 4.0 ppm, broad singlet, 2H. Broad singlet, maybe an NH group? Because amines or amides can give broad peaks. But wait, the integration is 2H, so maybe two protons in a group. But an NH2 would be two protons. Or perhaps an OCH2 group but in a different environment. Hmm, but at 4.0 ppm, that's more typical of something like an OCH2, perhaps in an ester. Wait, but an ethyl ester would have the CH2CH3 as triplet at 1.2, then the CH2 connected to oxygen as a quartet at around 4.1. But in the NMR, we have a quartet at 4.5.

Wait, looking at the data again:

1.20 ppm (t, 3H) → likely ethyl group, as before.

4.0 ppm (bs, 2H) → broad singlet, 2H. Maybe an NH group. But why two protons? Or perhaps it's adjacent to an electronegative atom, like O or N.

4.5 ppm (q, 2H) → quartet, 2H. That's a common pattern for a CH2 next to another CH2, like in an ethyl group. But wait, in ethyl esters, the OCH2CH3 would show a quartet for the OCH2 group (at around 4.1, I think). But here, it's at 4.5. So maybe it's a CH2 connected to something else. Or perhaps an amide group?

7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) → this looks like a para-substituted aromatic ring. The doublets indicate coupling with two equivalent protons each. So, perhaps a benzene ring with substituents in the para positions.

Putting this together, maybe it's an ethyl ester of a substituted benzoic acid or an amide.

Looking at the options:

A) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Structure is benzamide with an ethoxy group at position 3.

B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: Formamide group attached to the benzene at position 4 with an ethoxy.

C) 4-aminophenyl propionate: Propionyl group attached to benzene with an amino group in position 4.

D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate: Benzoate ester with ethyl group and amino in position 4.

Wait, but let's think about each option.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Structure is OEt-C6H4-NH2. Wait, but in this structure, the amino group is adjacent (ortho) to the ester group? Wait, no. 4-aminobenzoate would have the amino at position 4. So the ester is at position 1, and the amino at position 4. So, the substituents on the benzene are at positions 1 (ester) and 4 (NH2).

In the NMR, the aromatic protons would be in two sets of doublets. Because the substituents are in the para positions. So the protons adjacent to the substituents would be in a para pattern. For example, if the substituents are at 1 and 4, the H at 2 and 6 would be one set, and H at 3 and 5 another. But in the NMR, the user reports 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H). So that suggests a substituent where the ortho and para protons are in two doublets. Alternatively, if the substituents are in the para positions, the aromatic protons would split into two doublets. For example, in para-substituted benzene, the ortho protons would be deshielded and perhaps downfield, while the meta might be upfield. But I'm a bit fuzzy on exact shifts.

Alternatively, another possibility is that the substituents are in positions that create two doublets. For example, if the substituent is at position 4 (like the amino group in D), and the ester is at position 1, then the protons in positions 2 and 6 would be adjacent to the ester, and those in 3 and 5 adjacent to the amino. Wait, but amines are electron-donating, which would deshield the adjacent protons. Ester groups (like OEt) are also substituents that affect the ring. So the protons next to the ester would be downfield shifted, and those next to the amino group might be upfield? Or the opposite?

Hmm, perhaps the aromatic protons are split into two sets. Let's think: in ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, the ester is at position 1, amino at 4. Then, the ring has substituents at 1 (ester O) and 4 (NH2). The protons adjacent to substituents (positions 2 and 6, and positions 3 and 5) would have different shifts. The protons ortho to the ester (positions 2 and 6) would be deshielded (downfield) because the ester is an electron-withdrawing group. The protons meta to the amino group (positions 3 and 5) would be upfield or downfield? The amino group is electron-donating, so the meta protons would be deshielded as well. Wait, maybe I'm getting that wrong. Alternatively, maybe the amino group is deprotonated in the NMR, but that's unusual unless in a strongly basic condition, which isn't indicated here.

Wait, perhaps in the NMR, the aromatic signals are two doublets, likely due to the substituents in the para positions. So, for instance, in para-substituted benzene derivatives, the ortho and para protons would be in specific patterns. Let me think about toluene: the ortho and para protons to the methyl group are deshielded and appear as a doublet for each. But in more complex cases, it depends on the substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has substituents at positions 1 (ester) and 4 (something else), making the ring have two substituents in para positions.

Now, looking at the NMR:

At 7.0 ppm, a doublet (2H). At 8.0 ppm, another doublet (2H). So in total, four protons on the aromatic ring. That suggests that the substituents are in positions that split the ring into two sets of two equivalent protons each.

So, for example, if the substituents are at positions 1 and 4 (as in option D), the resulting aromatic protons would be at positions 2,6 and 3,5. Each of these would be equivalent and form a doublet. So the positions 2 and 6 would be one set, and 3 and 5 another. The substituent at position 1 (ester) would cause the 2,6 protons to be downfield, while the substituent at 4 (NH2) might cause the 3,5 protons to be upfield or downfield. But I'm not sure about the exact shift values.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are at positions 2 and 5, but that's less likely because the question options seem to suggest substituents at 4 and 1 in option D.

Looking back at the NMR data, the 4.5 ppm quartet (2H) and 4.0 ppm broad singlet (2H) are interesting. Let me think about each option.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Structure would have an OEt group attached to the benzene (as ester), and an NH2 group para to it. The ester group's OCH2CH3 would give a quartet for the OCH2 group around 4.1-4.2 ppm, but in the data, it's at 4.5. Hmm, that's a bit higher. Also, the amino group would have protons. In the NMR, there's a broad singlet at 4.0 ppm for 2H. If the amino group is NH2, its protons would typically appear as a broad peak, but I'm not sure about the shift. Wait, but in the structure of D, the amino group is in the para position. In the NMR, if the amino group is not deprotonated (which is unlikely at room temp in CDCl3), the NH2 would show as a broad peak. However, the integration is 2H, which fits an NH2 group. But the quartet at 4.5 ppm (2H) could correspond to the OCH2 of the ester. However, I thought that the OCH2 of an ethyl ester is usually around 4.1-4.2, not 4.5. So perhaps the shift is a bit higher because of the proximity to the amino group? Or maybe it's another group.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Structure is formamide (HCONH-) attached to the benzene ring at 4, with an ethoxy group at 4 as well? Wait, no, 4-ethoxyphenyl formamide would have the formamide group attached to the benzene, and an ethoxy substituent at position 4? Or perhaps the ethoxy is at another position. Wait, the formamide is HCONH- attached to the benzene, and the ethoxy is at position 4. So the substituents are at positions 1 (formamide) and 4 (ethoxy). The aromatic ring would have substituents in para positions again, leading to two doublets of 2H each.

In this case, the ethoxy group would give a triplet at 1.2 ppm (the CH2CH3), which matches. The OCH2 in ethoxy would give a quartet around 4.1 ppm (maybe a bit higher), but the NMR shows a quartet at 4.5. Hmm, not sure.

The formamide group would have an NH, which would show as a broad peak. But in B, the formamide would have only one NH (since it's N-substituted), so maybe the NH would be a singlet. But the NMR shows a quartet and a broad singlet. Wait, in B, the structure is HCONH-(Ph-OCH2CH3). Wait, no, it's N-substituted. So the formamide would have the structure RCONH2, but if substituents are attached to the N, then it's RCONHR'. Wait, no, option B is N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide, which would be HCONH–Ph-OCH2CH3. Wait, that would make the formamide have an NH2 group, but that doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps it's O=CN(Ph-OCH2CH3)–. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong. Let me think again. Formamide is HCONH2. If it's N-substituted, then it would have HCONHR. So in option B, the substituent on the NH is the 4-ethoxyphenyl group. So the structure would be HCONH-(4-ethoxyphenyl). So the amide would have an NH group, which is likely to show a broad peak. But the integration is 2H for the 4.0 ppm peak, which would imply two protons, so maybe that's the ethoxy OCH2 group.

Wait, but the ethoxy group would have a triplet for the CH2CH3 and a quartet for the OCH2. The quartet would be around 4.0-4.2, perhaps. But in the NMR data, the quartet is at 4.5. So maybe that's not matching.

Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. That would be CH2CH2COO- attached to the benzene with an NH2 at position 4. The propionate ester would have a CH2CH2COO- group. The NMR would have protons from the ethyl group attached to the COO. The CH2CH2 would show a triplet and a quartet. Let me think, the ester would be something like OCH2CH2COO-. Wait, no, propionate is CH2CH2COO-. So the ethyl group is connected to the carbonyl. So the NMR would show a triplet for the CH2CH3 (like the 1.20 ppm triplet), and a quartet for the adjacent CH2. But in the data, the quartet is at 4.5 ppm, which is upfield for an ethyl ester. So perhaps that's not matching.

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure is benzamide with an ethoxy group at position 3. Benzamide is CONH2 attached to benzene. Then the ethoxy is at position 3. The aromatic protons would be in positions that are ortho and para to the substituents. But the substituents are at positions 1 (CONH2) and 3 (OCH2CH3). Wait, that's meta to each other. So the aromatic protons would be in different environments, leading to more complex splitting. But the NMR shows two doublets, which suggests two sets of equivalent protons. Maybe that's not the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are para, which would give two doublets. So which options have substituents in para positions?

Looking back: option D has substituents at 1 (ester) and 4 (NH2), which are para. Similarly, option B has substituents at 1 (formamide) and 4 (ethoxy), which are para. So the aromatic NMR in both cases would have two doublets.

In the NMR data, the aromatic protons are at 7.0 and 8.0 ppm. Let's compare with what we might expect.

In an ester with an amino group (like D), the substituents are electron-withdrawing (ester) and electron-donating (amino). The ester at position 1 would deshield the adjacent protons (positions 2 and 6), making them downfield. The amino group at position 4 would deshield the adjacent protons (positions 3 and 5), but amino is electron-donating, which usually causes the adjacent protons to be upfield. Wait, but amino groups are strongly activating, so the adjacent protons would be more shielded, appearing upfield. So the 2 and 6 protons would be downfield (higher ppm), and the 3 and 5 upfield (lower ppm). But in the data, the doublets are at 7.0 and 8.0. So perhaps the 8.0 ppm is the more deshielded (downfield) set, and 7.0 is the upfield set.

Alternatively, it's possible that the ester group is more de-shielding than the amino group, so the 2 and 6 protons are downfield (8.0 ppm), and the 3 and 5 are upfield (7.0 ppm). That would fit.

Now, looking at the other NMR signals. Let's consider option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.

The structure is OEt-C6H4-NH2 (parasubstituted).

The ethyl ester group would have:

- CH2CH3 as triplet at ~1.2 ppm (matches the data)

- OCH2 (from ethyl ester) as quartet around 4.1-4.3 ppm. But in the data, we have a quartet at 4.5 ppm. Hmm, that's a bit higher. Could that be?

The NH2 group would have protons. But in the NMR, the broad singlet is at 4.0 ppm for 2H. That's a bit upfield for NH2, which typically appears around 1-5 ppm but can vary. However, the NH2 protons are usually broad and might not be integrated if they're exchanging. Wait, but in the data, the 4.0 ppm is a broad singlet integrating to 2H, which could correspond to NH2. Alternatively, the 4.5 quartet could be OCH2 from the ester, but shifted higher because of the amino group's influence.

Wait, another possibility: the 4.5 quartet might not be from the ester. Let's think about other structures. For example, in an amide, the NH is adjacent to the carbonyl, but in an ethyl ester, the OCH2 would be adjacent to the carbonyl.

Alternatively, let's think about the quartet at 4.5 ppm. A quartet arises from two neighboring protons. So for a CH2 group, next to another CH2 group. So ethyl groups normally show a quartet for the OCH2. Could the quartet at 4.5 be from an OCH2 adjacent to another CH2? For example, in an ethyl ester, the OCH2 would be next to the CH3, so its neighboring protons are from the CH3. Wait, but that would be a triplet, not a quartet. Hmm, no, the OCH2 would be next to the CH2CH3, which has two protons. So the OCH2 would be a quartet (n+1, where n=2), which matches. So in an ethyl ester, the OCH2 would be a quartet at ~4.1-4.2. But in the data, it's at 4.5. So maybe the presence of the amino group nearby is causing the shift. Amino groups can have ring current effects or other electronic effects that shift nearby protons.

Then, the 4.0 ppm broad singlet (2H) would be the NH2 group. But wait, in D, the amino group is NH2, which would have two protons. But in the NMR, the broad singlet is integrating to 2H. So that fits. But I'm a bit confused because the amino group is usually broad and can exchange rapidly, but in the NMR data, it's showing as a singlet. Alternatively, perhaps it's an NH group, but option D has NH2.

Wait, perhaps the 4.0 ppm peak isn't the amino group. Let's think about other possibilities. The quartet at 4.5 could be from a CH2 connected to an oxygen, such as in an ester. The 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H) could be from a CH2 connected to an amide nitrogen. For example, in a structure where there's a CH2NH group, such as in a formamide. Let's look at option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide.

Structure: formamide (HCONH–) attached to benzene, which has an ethoxy group at position 4. So the substituents are at positions 1 and 4. The formamide group would have NH, which would show as a broad peak. But in option B, the substituent is HCONH– attached to the benzene, and the ethoxy is at position 4. So the NH would be part of the formamide, which is HCONH–. So the NH would be a singlet, but in the data, it's a broad singlet for 2H. That doesn't fit because the formamide would have only one NH proton. Unless it's a different structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the quartet at 4.5 is from the ethoxy group's OCH2, and the 4.0 ppm is from a CH2 connected to the amide nitrogen. Like in a structure where there's an –OCH2CH3 and an –N–CH2– group.

Wait, looking at option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. Structure would be CH2CH2COO– attached to benzene, with NH2 at position 4. The ethyl group from the propionate would give a triplet at 1.2 and a quartet around 4.0-4.2. But in the data, the quartet is at 4.5, which is higher. So maybe that's not matching.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about the IR data. The strong band at 1720 cm-1 suggests a carbonyl. Ester carbonyls are around 1720-1740, amides are lower, around 1650. So the 1720 suggests an ester (like D) or maybe an amide if it's a different situation. Wait, but the IR also has strong N-H stretches, which could be from amide or amine groups. So in option D, the structure has an ester (so 1720) and an amine (so N-H stretches). So that fits.

In option B, the formamide has an amide group, which would show a carbonyl around 1650. But the IR here is 1720, which is more ester-like. So option B is less likely because the formamide's carbonyl would be lower.

So putting this together:

- Ester group (1720 cm-1) → points towards D or maybe C.

- Aromatic protons split into two doublets → suggests para-substituted rings, which are options B, D.

- The ethoxy group's triplet at 1.2 ppm → all options except maybe C (but C is a propionate).

- The quartet at 4.5 ppm → could be the OCH2 of the ester, perhaps shifted due to proximity to amino group.

- The broad singlet at 4.0 ppm → likely the NH2 group.

So option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.

But wait, in D, the amino group is NH2, and the ester is OEt. So in the NMR, the OCH2 would be a quartet around 4.1, but in the data it's at 4.5. Could this be due to the amino group's deshielding effect? Or perhaps because of the substituents on the benzene ring causing a ring current effect shifting the OCH2 group upfield or downfield?

Alternatively, perhaps the quartet isn't from the OCH2. Maybe the quartet is from another CH2 group, like if there's a CH2NH group.

Wait, another approach: let's think about the integration. The 1.20 ppm triplet is 3H, so that's likely the CH2CH3 of an ethyl group. The quartet at 4.5 is 2H, and the broad singlet at 4.0 is 2H. If the quartet is the OCH2 from the ethyl ester, then the broad singlet must be something else. But in D, the only other protons would be from the NH2 group, which would be a broad singlet. But in D, the NH2 is at the para position, so its protons would be exchangeable and may not appear as a strong peak. Wait, but the data shows a strong peak for the NH2.

Alternatively, perhaps the quartet is from another group. Let me think about the structure again.

Option D: The structure is benzene with OEt at position 1 and NH2 at position 4. So, the OEt is attached to the carbonyl, making it an ester (benzoate ester). The OEt group would have the CH2CH3 as triplet (1.2 ppm), the OCH2 as quartet (around 4.1-4.2). The NH2 is a separate group. So in the NMR, the NH2 would give a broad peak, but where?

In the data, the 4.0 ppm is a broad singlet integrating to 2H. So that could be the NH2. But why is it at 4.0 ppm? Usually, NH2 protons are upfield, around 1-5 ppm but broad. Alternatively, maybe it's not NH2 but something else.

Wait, perhaps the structure is different. Let me think about option B again. Option B is N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Structure: HCONH-(4-OCH2CH3)benzene.

In that case, the formamide's NH would be a singlet, but in the data, we have a broad singlet integrating to 2H. That doesn't fit. So perhaps that's not the correct option.

Another possibility: the quartet at 4.5 ppm could be from a CH2 adjacent to an oxygen, and the 4.0 ppm could be from an NH group.

Wait, let's consider option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. Structure: benzene with NH2 at 4 and propionate (CH2CH2COO-) attached to the benzene.

The propionate's CH2CH2 would have the CH2 closer to the COO as a quartet (connected to another CH2), and the CH2CH3 as a triplet. So the OCH2 would be a quartet around 4.1-4.2, which doesn't match the data's 4.5. So perhaps that's not it.

Wait, perhaps the quartet at 4.5 is the CH2 group adjacent to the amide group. If the structure is an amide, then the CH2 could be next to the amide's carbonyl, leading to a shift. For example, in an amide like benzamide with an ethyl group attached, the CH2 next to the carbonyl would show up as a quartet.

Let me think about option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure: benzamide (CONH2) with ethoxy group at position 3.

In this case, the ethoxy would give triplet at 1.2, quartet at ~4.1. The CONH2 would have NH2 protons, which would be broad, perhaps at around 4.0-8.0 ppm. But in the data, the 4.0 ppm is a broad singlet, which could be the NH2. The quartet at 4.5 doesn't fit the ethoxy's OCH2.

Alternatively, maybe the quartet is from another group. But I'm not sure.

Another angle: the 1H NMR shows a triplet at 1.2 (3H), which is the ethyl tail. Then, a quartet at 4.5 (2H) which is likely the OCH2 of the ethyl group. But in the case of an ester, the OCH2 is usually around 4.1-4.2. So why is it at 4.5?

Perhaps it's not an ethyl ester, but another ethyl group attached to something else. Or maybe it's a CH2 adjacent to an electronegative group, like O or N.

Wait, looking back at option D: the quartet at 4.5 would be the OCH2, but in reality, perhaps in the presence of the amino group, the OCH2 is deshielded, leading to a higher ppm. Alternatively, the amino group could cause the OCH2 to be more deshielded, shifting it downfield. So the quartet could move to 4.5.

Also, the amino group's protons would be broad, but in the data, the 4.0 ppm is a broad singlet integrating to 2H, which fits the NH2 group.

So putting it all together:

The ethyl ester group would have the triplet at 1.2, quartet at 4.5 (OCH2), and the NH2 would be a broad singlet at 4.0 ppm. The aromatic protons are in two doublets, which fit a para-substituted ring. So option D seems to fit.


The molecular formula of the compound is **C9H11NO2**, giving a degree of unsaturation (DoU) of 5. This suggests the presence of a benzene ring (3 DoU) and additional unsaturation, likely from a carbonyl group (1 DoU) and possibly an amide or ester functional group. The IR spectrum shows strong absorption bands at **3420 cm⁻¹** and **3325 cm⁻¹**, indicative of N-H stretches, and a strong band at **1720 cm⁻¹**, characteristic of a carbonyl group, likely from an ester or amide. The ¹H NMR data provides further clues:

- **1.20 ppm (t, 3H)**: A triplet, consistent with a CH2CH3 group, likely from an ethyl group.
- **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H)**: A broad singlet, likely from an NH2 group.
- **4.5 ppm (q, 2H)**: A quartet, characteristic of a CH2 group adjacent to another CH2, likely from an ethyl group.
- **7.0 ppm (d, 2H)** and **8.0 ppm (d, 2H)**: Two doublets, indicating a para-substituted aromatic ring.

### Analysis of Options:

#### **Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide**
- Structure: Benzamide (CONH2) with an ethoxy group at position 3.
- The ethoxy group would produce a triplet at ~1.2 ppm and a quartet at ~4.1 ppm. However, the NMR data shows a quartet at 4.5 ppm, which is inconsistent with the expected shift for the ethoxy group. Additionally, the aromatic protons would not produce two doublets due to the meta substitution pattern.  
- **Eliminated.**

#### **Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide**
- Structure: Formamide (HCONH–) attached to a benzene ring with an ethoxy group at position 4.
- The ethoxy group would produce a triplet at ~1.2 ppm and a quartet at ~4.1 ppm, which partially matches the NMR data. However, the formamide group would have only one NH proton, inconsistent with the broad singlet at 4.0 ppm integrating to 2H.  
- **Eliminated.**

#### **Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate**
- Structure: A benzene ring with an NH2 group at position 4 and a propionate (CH2CH2COO–) group.
- The propionate group would produce a triplet at ~1.2 ppm and a quartet at ~4.1 ppm. However, the NMR data shows a quartet at 4.5 ppm, which is inconsistent with the expected shift for the propionate group.  
- **Eliminated.**

#### **Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**
- Structure: A benzene ring with an ethyl ester group at position 1 and an NH2 group at position 4.
- The ethyl ester group produces a triplet at ~1.2 ppm (CH2CH3) and a quartet at ~4.5 ppm (OCH2), consistent with the NMR data. The NH2 group produces a broad singlet at 4.0 ppm, matching the data. The para-substitution pattern of the benzene ring explains the two doublets at 7.0 ppm and 8.0 ppm for the aromatic protons.  
- **Matches all data.**

### Conclusion:
The spectroscopic data is consistent with **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**. 

**Answer: D**
