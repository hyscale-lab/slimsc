Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about stars and which ones can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, let me think this through.

First, I need to understand the parameters given for each star and the capabilities of each spectrograph. The question says that ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. Wait, wait, no, waitâ€”the question says that with ESPRESSO, stars brighter than 17 mag can be observed. Wait, no, wait: no, the V magnitude is a measure where lower numbers are brighter. So if a star has a V magnitude of 17, that's pretty faint. So ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17, meaning less than or equal to 17? Or is it more than 17? Hmm, no, no: the question states, "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed." So brighter than 17 would mean apparent magnitude less than 17, because lower magnitude numbers are brighter. So ESPRESSO can see stars up to 17 apparent mag? Or wait, the way it's phrased: "brighter than 17 mag" meaning magnitude is less than 17. So ESPRESSO can observe stars up to apparent V magnitude of 17, because stars brighter than that (i.e., magnitudes <17) are observable.

Similarly, HIRES can observe
