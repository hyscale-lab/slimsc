Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me see if I can figure it out. The question is about calculating the net potential energy of a system where a charge q is placed a certain distance away from a grounded conducting sphere. Hmm, right.

Wait, I remember that when dealing with potential energy in electrostatics, especially with conductors, image charges come into play. Oh right, the method of images is a technique used to solve problems involving charges placed near conductors. So maybe that's the way to go.

The setup is this: there's a conducting sphere of radius R that's grounded. A charge q is placed at a distance d from the center of this sphere. So the distance between the charge and the sphere's center is d. Since the sphere is grounded, its potential must be zero. Or wait, no—wait, the potential of a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium is the same throughout, and if it's grounded, it's at the same potential as the Earth, which we take as zero.

But wait, no. Actually, the potential of a conducting sphere is determined by its charge. If it's grounded, any excess charge will be neutralized, but wait, no— if another charge is near, the sphere will have induced charges. Hmm, but since the sphere is grounded, it can have induced charges because the grounding allows charges to flow in or out.

Wait, no, when a conductor is grounded, any excess charge on it is neutralized by the Earth. But in this case, the charge q is external. So the sphere will have induced charges due to the presence of q. But because it's grounded, the net charge on the sphere must be zero. Because any induced charge would cause a current until the sphere's potential matches the ground's, which is zero. Oh, wait, not necessarily. If the sphere is conducting and neutral, and then an external charge is placed near it, the sphere will have induced charges but remain neutral overall because it's grounded.

Wait, no. Let's think. The sphere is initially neutral. When charge q is placed near it, the sphere's electrons will be attracted to the region closer to q, leaving the opposite side positively charged. But since the sphere is grounded, the excess positive charge on the far side would cause electrons to flow into the sphere (or wait, no, electrons are negative—so if the sphere near q has negative charges, the opposite side is positive, which would cause electrons to flow out of the sphere, but wait, the sphere is grounded, so
