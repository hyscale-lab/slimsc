Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit rusty on some concepts, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The problem says that a chemist performs two reactions. Both reactions involve treating either (E)-oct-4-ene or (Z)-oct-4-ene with mCPBA followed by aqueous acid. Then, the products are combined and analyzed on both standard (achiral) and chiral HPLC columns. The question is about what the chemist observes in each chromatogram.

Hmm, I remember that mCPBA is meta-chloroperbenzoic acid, which is a peracid. It's commonly used in epoxidation reactions, specifically for epoxidizing alkenes. Epoxidation is a reaction where an alkene reacts with a peracid to form an epoxide. But wait, I should think about the stereochemistry here. The reaction of mCPBA with alkenes typically leads to the formation of epoxides via an electrocyclic mechanism, which is concerted. So the configuration of the starting alkene affects the product epoxide's stereochemistry.

Wait, actually, for (E) and (Z) alkenes, how does the epoxidation proceed? I think that for mCPBA, the reaction is stereospecific. The peracid approaches the less substituted side of the double bond, but wait, no, wait. Wait, mCPBA is a peracid, which is a good electrophile. The reaction mechanism forms an epoxide, and the approach is such that the epoxide adds with a specific stereochemistry based on the geometry of the starting alkene.

Wait, no, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The reaction of mCPBA with alkenes forms an epoxide. The addition is such that the oxygen atoms add across the double bond in a trans fashion relative to the starting geometry. Or maybe in a way that depends on the starting configuration.

Wait, another approach: when a peracid reacts with an alkene, the epoxide forms with the same stereochemistry as the starting alkene. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, could the epoxidation lead to a specific diastereomer based on the starting alkene's configuration.

Wait, I think I remember that when mCPBA reacts with a trans (E) alkene, it forms an epoxide with a trans configuration in the epoxide ring. Similarly, reacting with a cis (Z) alkene gives a
