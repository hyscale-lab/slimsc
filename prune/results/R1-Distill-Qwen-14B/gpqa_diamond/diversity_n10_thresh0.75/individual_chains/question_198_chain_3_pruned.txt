Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, I need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes. Let's see, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The problem says the solution has Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-). The concentrations are c(Co) = 1e-2 M and [SCN-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) given are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Wait, I think stability constants are for the formation of complexes. Like, β is the equilibrium constant for the formation of each complex.

So, the complexes would be Co(SCN)n^2–n, right? Starting from n=0 (just Co²+), then n=1, n=2, etc.

The question asks specifically about the dithiocyanato complex, which is the Co(SCN)₂ complex. So that's the third complex, I believe. Wait, no, wait. Let me think: for each n, βn is the stability constant for the complex with n SCN- ligands. So β1 is for CoSCN+ (n=1), β2 for Co(SCN)₂ (n=2, which is the dithiocyanato complex), β3 for Co(SCN)3^-, and β4 for Co(SCN)4^2–.

So, the complexes are:
- Co²+ (n=0)
- CoSCN+ (n=1)
- Co(SCN)₂ (n=2)
- Co(SCN)3^- (n=3)
- Co(SCN)4^2– (n=4)

The problem is asking about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex, which I think refers to the Co(SCN)₂ species. So we need to find the fraction of Co that's in the form of Co(SCN)₂.

Stability constants are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Wait, β4 is smaller than β3? That might mean that the higher complexes are less stable than the lower ones, but I'm not sure how the stability constants compare.

So, the approach here is
