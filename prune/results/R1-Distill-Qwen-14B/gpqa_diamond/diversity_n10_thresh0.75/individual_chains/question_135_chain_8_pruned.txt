Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me about the decay of a boson. Hmm, let's try to break it down. I'm a bit rusty on particle physics, but I'll think it through.

The question gives me the Lagrangian for the interaction between the bosonic field X and fermions. The Lagrangian is written as L(y) = -λf ψ̄_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). I remember that the Lagrangian describes the interactions, so this term must be the interaction Lagrangian between X and the fermions.

Wait, the structure looks familiar. The term ψ̄ (something) ψ is a typical fermion interaction. I think this must be a Yukawa coupling. Oh right, Yukawa interactions are responsible for things like the Higgs coupling to fermions. So the boson X is coupling to fermions via a Yukawa interaction.

The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. So when it decays, the decay products must have masses less than 6 GeV each because energy and momentum have to be conserved. Also, the decay must conserve quantum numbers and follow the interaction terms.

The problem is asking for the kinematically allowed decays at the lowest order. So we're looking for possible fermion-antifermion pairs that the X boson can decay into, considering the mass constraints and the interaction terms.

Looking at the options, they all list various fermion pairs. Let me think about the possible fermions and their masses.

First, the fermions involved are quarks and leptons. Each fermion has a mass, and the X boson must have enough mass to produce the pair. The X is 6 GeV, so each fermion's mass must be less than or equal to 3 GeV, because each decay product would take some mass, and for a pair, it's twice the mass (like 2m_f for fermion f). Wait, not exactly, because energy and momentum can be considered, but for the sake of kinematics, the threshold would be when the two fermions are at rest, so each needs to have a mass less than or equal to 3 GeV.

Wait, but actually, the decay X → f f̄ requires that the sum of the rest masses of f and f̄ is less than or equal to the mass of X. Since f and f̄ have the same mass, the sum is 2m_f. So 2m_f ≤ m_X. Thus, m_f ≤ 3 GeV.

So let's list the masses of all possible fermions:

Quarks:
- Up (u): ~2.2 MeV
- Down (d): ~4.7 MeV
- Strange (s): ~100 MeV
- Charm (c): ~1.5 GeV
- Bottom (b): ~4.5 GeV
- Top (t): ~173 GeV

Leptons:
- Electron (e): ~0.5 MeV
- Muon (μ): ~105.7 MeV
- Tau (τ): ~1.78 GeV

So, for each fermion f, 2m_f ≤6 GeV → m_f ≤3 GeV.

So let's check which fermions satisfy that.

- u: 2.2 MeV → yes
- d: 4.7 MeV → yes
- s: 100 MeV → yes
- c: 1.5 GeV → yes (since 1.5 <3)
- b: 4.5 GeV → 4.5*2=9 GeV >6 → no
- t: way too big → no

Leptons:
- e: 0.5 MeV → yes
- μ: 105.7 MeV → 0.21 GeV → yes
- τ: 1.78 GeV → 1.78 <3 → yes

So the possible fermions that X can decay into are: u, d, s, c, e, μ, τ.

Wait, but wait. The Lagrangian term is given as -λf ψ̄_f (v + X) ψ_f. So the interaction is between X and a fermion ψ_f. So the decay X → f f̄ is allowed only if the fermion f is present in the interaction term.

But the problem is, the Lagrangian is written as a general term. The subscript f suggests that it's for each fermion type. So X can interact with all fermions. So any fermion pair is allowed, as long as their masses are less than 3 GeV.

So the possible decay channels are:

X → u ū, d d̄, s s̄, c c̄, e+ e-, μ+
