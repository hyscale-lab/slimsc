Okay, so I need to find the partition function Z for a system of three spins. Each spin can be either +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J [S1 S2 + S1 S3 + S2 S3]. Hmm, I remember that the partition function is the sum over all possible states of exp(-β E), where β is 1/(k T).

Wait, right, each spin has two possible states, so three spins would have 2^3 =8 possible states. But calculating each state individually might take time, but maybe there's a smarter way.

Let me think about the structure of the energy. E depends on the product of each pair of spins. Each term S_i S_j is +1 if the spins are the same, and -1 if different. So for each pair, if they are aligned, that term contributes +1, else -1.

The energy is -J multiplied by the sum of these terms. So E is -J*(n), where n is the number of aligned pairs. But wait, each term is S_i S_j, so each gives +1 or -1. So the sum is (number of aligned pairs)*1 plus (number of misaligned pairs)*(-1). Let me see, for three spins, how does this work?

Wait, for three spins, there are three pairs: 1-2, 1-3, 2-3. So each term is either +1 or -1. Let me denote the sum as S = S1 S2 + S1 S3 + S2 S3. So E = -J S.

So the energy for each state is E = -J S, where S is the sum of the three pairwise products.

So the partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of exp(-β E). Substituting E, that's sum exp( J β S ), since E is negative J S. So Z = sum exp( J β S ), where the sum is over all possible states.

Wait, but what's the possible range of S? Let me compute S for all possible states.

Each S can be the sum of three terms, each ±1. So S can be 3, 1, -1, -3. Let's find how many states give each value of S.

Let's list all possible states and compute S for each.

Each state is a combination of S1, S2, S3 being +1 or -1.

Case 1: All three spins are +1. So S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=+1.

Then S = (1*1) + (1*1) + (1*1) = 1+1+1=3.

Case 2: Two +1, one -1. Let's see the possibilities:

Subcase 2a: S3=-1, others +1: S1=1, S2=1, S3=-1.

Compute S: (1)(1) + (1)(-1) + (1)(-1) = 1 -1 -1 = -1.

Subcase 2b: S2=-1: S1=1, S2=-1, S3=1. Then S = (1)(-1) + (1)(1) + (-1)(1) = -1 +1 -1 = -1.

Subcase 2c: S1=-1: S1=-1, S2=1, S3=1. S = (-1)(1
