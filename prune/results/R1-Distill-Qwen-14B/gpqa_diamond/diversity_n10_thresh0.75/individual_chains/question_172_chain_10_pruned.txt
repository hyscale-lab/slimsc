Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their effective temperatures. Hmm, let's see. The question says that iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh right, photosphere is the layer of a star where photosynthesis happens, but wait, no, waitâ€”that's plants. Photosphere is where the light is emitted, right? So it's about the outer layer of the star where we see light.

The energy difference between the energy levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Oh wait, that's the energy difference for the specific level they're considering. And the problem says that the photospheres are in LTE, Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium. So that means the conditions there follow the Boltzmann distribution for the energy levels of atoms.

Boltzmann distribution, right. The probability of a system being in a certain energy state is proportional to exp(-E/(kT)), where k is Boltzmann's constant and T is the temperature. So, the ratio of populations in two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann factor.

Wait, but here, the question is about the excitation. So, the number of atoms in a higher energy level compared to a lower one depends on temperature. But in this case, the question says that the excitation is twice as much for star_1 compared to star_2. So, the ratio (N1/N2) is 2, where N1 is the number for star_1, N2 for star_2.

Wait, wait, more precisely, the ratio of the populations of the two energy levels (say level 2 and level 1, where level 2 is higher) is given by (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2-E1)/(k T) ), where g's are the degeneracies. But if the energy levels are the same, then g2/g1 would matter. Wait, but the problem says the energy difference is the same for both stars. So E2-E1 is the same for each star, right?

So the ratio of the populations in the excited state to the ground state (assuming E2 is higher than E1) is proportional to exp( - delta E/(k T) ), multiplied by the ratio of their degeneracies. But wait, the problem doesn't mention degeneracy, so perhaps we can assume it's the
