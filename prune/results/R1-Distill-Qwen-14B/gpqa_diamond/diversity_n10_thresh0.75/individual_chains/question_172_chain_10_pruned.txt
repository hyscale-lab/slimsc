Okay, so I have this question about stars and iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I remember that in stars, the photosphere emits light, and the energy levels of atoms in there are related to the star's temperature. The question says that iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh right, when something is more excited, it means it's in a higher energy state. 

Wait, but the energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. I think this is the delta E or the energy gap between two energy levels. Oh, and the problem states that the photospheres are in LTE, which stands for Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium. So that means the distribution of atoms in energy levels follows the Boltzmann distribution. 

Boltzmann distribution says that the population of a particular energy level is proportional to exp(-E/(k*T)), where E is the energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature. So if two stars have their iron atoms in different energy levels, the ratio of their populations can be determined using this formula.

So, the question states that the excited state population in star_1 is twice that of star_2. Let me denote the excited state as level E and the lower state as E'. Let me call the ratio n1/n2, where n1 is the population of the excited state in star_1 and n2 in star_2. So n1/n2 = 2.

Using the Boltzmann equation for each star:

n1 = (g1/g2) * exp(-E/(k*T1))
n2 = (g1/g2) * exp(-E/(k*T2))

Wait, but wait, the ratio n1/n2 would be [exp(-E/(k T1))] / [exp(-E/(k T2))], because the statistical weights (g1/g2) would cancel out when taking the ratio.

So n1/n2 = exp[(E/(k)) (1/T2 - 1/T1)]

Wait, no. Wait, the ratio is exp( (E/(k)) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )? Let me think about the exponents. For n1, it's exp(-E/(k T1)), and for n2, it's exp(-E/(k T2)). So when you take n1/n2, it's [exp(-E
