Okay, so I have this chemistry question here about optical activity. Hmm, I remember that optical activity is when a compound can rotate plane-polarized light, which usually means the compound has chiral centers. But wait, there's more to it. Some compounds can have chiral centers but still be meso compounds, which are not optically active. Oh right, meso compounds have multiple stereocenters but due to a plane of symmetry, they're achiral.

The question gives seven compounds, and I need to figure out how many are optically active. Let's go one by one.

1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene
Wait, this is a chlorinated alkene. The structure is CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2. Oh wait, but wait, but for a molecule to have optical activity, it needs a chiral center. Let me think: The molecule is 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. Structure would be Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2. Wait, but the double bond is between C1 and C2? No, but wait, butene is four carbons. Wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3, but this is 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene, so the structure is Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? So the double bond is between C1 and C2. So, the molecule is Cl attached to C1, which is double bonded to C2 which has a methyl group. Hmm.

But wait, in this structure, is there a chiral center? Let's see: C1 is Cl, but it's double bonded, so it can't be a chiral center. The other carbons: C2 has a double bond, so it's sp² hybridized. So, in the double bond, any substituents? C2 has a methyl, a double bond to C1, and two CH2 groups? Wait no, but but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So in this case, 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would be Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Wait, no, wait. Butene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 2-methylbut-1-ene would be CH2=C(CH2CH3)CH2? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps 2-methylbut-1-ene is CH2=C-CH(CH3)-something. Wait, but but-1-ene is four carbons: 1 and 2 are double bonded. So 2-methylbut-1-ene would be CH2=C(CH2CH3)CH2? Wait, no. Let me count: but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 2-methyl would mean a methyl branch on C2. So C2 is CH, but wait, no. Wait, but wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So adding a methyl on C2 would make it CH2=C(CH2CH3)CH2CH3? Wait, that can't be right because the structure would have five carbons. Hmm, perhaps I'm complicating this. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps 2-methylbut-1-ene is (CH3)CH2CH2CH2 with a double bond between C1 and C2. No, that doesn't make sense. Maybe I should just move on, as I might be getting stuck here. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is Cl on C1, which is double bonded to C2. So Cl-C(=CH2)-CH(CH3)... Wait, no, perhaps the structure is Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2, which is (Z) configuration. But in any case, regardless of the configuration, does this molecule have a chiral center? No, because the only possible chiral center would be C1, but Cl is on C1, which is double bonded. So no chiral centers. So no optical activity.

Wait, but wait: wait, but in the molecule (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene, is there any stereogenic center? Let's see: C1 has Cl, and double bond to C2. So C1 is sp² hybridized, so it can't be a chiral center. C2 is also sp², attached to a methyl group and a CH2Cl. Hmm. So no chiral centers here. So this compound is not optically active. So 0 so far.

2. (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione
Wow, that's a mouthful. Let's try to parse this. It's a bicyclic compound, I think. Hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione suggests a fused ring system involving furan rings and maybe a ketone. The substituent is chloromethylene at position 8, with E configuration. Also, the stereochemistry is given as 3aR and 7aS.

Wait, but this molecule has a chloromethylene group. Chloromethylene would be Cl–CH₂– in a double bond, perhaps. Wait, the substituent is 8-(chloromethylene), which would be Cl–CH₂– attached to the ring. Wait, but the E configuration might imply that the substituents on either side are in a trans arrangement.

But does this molecule have a chiral center? The rings are fused, so maybe there's a bridge or some other structure. The positions 3a and 7a are given with R and S configurations. So each of these positions is a stereogenic center. Since these are two different stereocenters, and the molecule is not meso (probably), it should have optical activity. So this compound would be chiral.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry that would make it meso. But I'm not sure. Let me think. The substituents are on different bridgeheads. If the two stereocenters are on different bridgeheads, then even if they have opposite configurations, perhaps they don't create a plane of symmetry. Wait, in this case, 3aR and 7aS. If the molecule is not symmetric, then it would have optical activity. So I'll tentatively count this as active. So 1 active.

3. (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid
Succinic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. So when it's 2,3-dimethyl, it becomes HOOC-C(CH3)H-CH(CH3)-COOH.

Wait, but wait, the structure is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH? Or is it 2 and 3 carbons each with methyl groups?

Wait, the structure is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH, so 2 and 3 are the two middle carbons. So 2R and 3S would mean each of these CH2 groups is a chiral center.

Wait, wait a minute: the molecule is succinic acid, which is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. Adding methyl groups on C2 and C3 would make them CH(CH3) groups. So the structure is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH.

But wait, are those carbons chiral centers? For a carbon to be a chiral center, it must have four different substituents. Let's see:

For C2: attached groups are:
- Two -CH(CH3) groups? Wait, no. Let me think. C2 is attached to:
- the succinic acid chain: one is the COOH group on the left (as in, the C1 is COOH, C2 is CH(CH3), C3 is CH(CH3), and C4 is COOH.

Wait, no, the structure is:
HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH?

Wait, succinic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. So adding methyl groups on C2 and C3 would give HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH.

Now, each of the CH(CH3) centers: what are their substituents?

For C2 (the second carbon): it's connected to:
- the COOH group (C1),
- a CH(CH3) group (C3),
- two CH3 groups? No, wait. No: C2 has:
- COOH (C1),
- the next carbon (C3),
- a methyl group,
- and a hydrogen. Because the structure is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH.

Wait, no, each of the middle CH2 groups becomes CH(CH3). So each of the middle carbons (C2 and C3) would have:

C2: COOH (C1), CH(CH3) (C3), CH3, and H.

Wait, but wait: no, because the two central carbons are CH(CH3) groups, each with two CH3 groups? No, wait. Let me draw the structure.

The four carbons are:

1: COOH
2: CH(CH3)
3: CH(CH3)
4: COOH

So for C2:

The four groups are:
- COOH (from C1),
- CH(CH3) (from C3),
- CH3 (methyl),
- and a hydrogen (H).

So substituents are COOH, CH(CH3), CH3, H. That's four different groups, so it's a chiral center. Similarly, C3 has:
- COOH (from C4),
- CH(CH3) (from C2),
- CH3,
- H.

Wait, but wait a second, in this case, C2 and C3 are each connected to each other and to two methyl groups and a hydrogen. So each of them is a chiral center.

So the molecule has two chiral centers: C2 (R) and C3 (S). Now, is this molecule a meso compound? Because sometimes, even with two chiral centers, the molecule can have a plane of symmetry.

In succinic acid, if you have two chiral centers, and if the substituents are arranged symmetrically, the molecule might be meso. For example, if the substituents on C2 and C3 are mirror images, the molecule could be identical on both sides, making it meso.

Wait, in this case, both C2 and C3 have the same substituents: each is connected to COOH (but C2 is connected to the left COOH, and C3 connected to the right COOH), CH(CH3), CH3, and H. So if the configurations are R and S, then perhaps the molecule is not symmetric. Wait, but let's imagine the structure.

Imagine the two middle carbons, each with a methyl group. If C2 is R and C3 is S, then the arrangement would be such that the configuration is not a mirror image. Wait, but wait, let me think about this.

Let's imagine the two chiral centers: if C2 is R and C3 is S, and their substituents are arranged in a way that the molecule doesn't have a plane of symmetry. So for example, the groups on C2 and C3 are arranged such that they're not mirror images. So the molecule wouldn't be meso, meaning it would have optical activity.

But wait, in some cases, two chiral centers can make a meso compound. For example, tartaric acid: (R,S) configuration can be a meso form if the substituents on each are arranged symmetrically.

In this case, the substituents on C2 and C3 are the same. Let's consider whether the molecule has a plane of symmetry. If I draw the molecule, the two CH(CH3) groups are on adjacent carbons, each with a methyl group. The other substituents are the two COOH groups. So, is there a plane of symmetry that would make the two halves mirror images?

Wait, if the molecule is symmetric along the midplane between C2 and C3, then perhaps it's a meso compound. Let me imagine: if C2 is R and C3 is S, but the arrangement is such that flipping the molecule along the midplane would result in the same structure. So the substituents would mirror each other.

Wait, but for that to happen, the configurations would need to be opposite. So if C2 is R and C3 is S, but arranged symmetrically, perhaps the molecule would have a plane of symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps not. Let me think about the substituents. Each of the central carbons has a methyl group, a hydrogen, and two different carbonyl groups attached. Wait, but the two carbonyl groups are on either end. So the left side is a COOH group attached to C2, and the right side is a COOH attached to C3.

Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule isn't meso, so it's chiral. If I'm not sure, perhaps I should go with the assumption that it's chiral. So this compound would be optically active. So count 2.

Wait, but wait, another point: for a molecule to be meso, the two chiral centers must have opposite configurations (R and S) and the substituents must be arranged in a way that creates a plane of symmetry.

In this case, the substituents on C2 and C3 are the same: each has a methyl group, a hydrogen, and two COOH groups (but on opposite ends).

Wait, let me try to imagine the structure. The molecule is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. Let me imagine the central two carbons each with a methyl and a hydrogen, and the COOH groups on either side. If I draw this, perhaps the two central carbons are symmetric with each other. So, if C2 is R and C3 is S, the arrangement might mirror each other, making the molecule meso.

Wait, in that scenario, the molecule would have a plane of symmetry through the center of the two central carbons. So the molecule would be meso, meaning it's achiral.

Wait, but wait, how can that be? Because if C2 is R and C3 is S, and the substituents are arranged symmetrically, then the molecule would be meso. So the overall molecule wouldn't be chiral.

But wait, in the question, the stereochemistry is given as (2R,3S). So if this is the case, then in the molecule, C2 is R and C3 is S. So, if the molecule is symmetric, then it would be a meso compound, and thus not optically active.

But I'm a bit confused. For example, in (R,S) configuration, if the substituents are arranged in a way that the molecule is symmetric, then it's a meso compound. So in this case, I think this molecule is a meso compound, so it's not optically active. So no, this compound isn't active. Hmm, this is tricky.

Wait, another way to think about it: if you have two chiral centers and the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it's meso. So, in this case, if the two chiral centers are arranged symmetrically, it would be a meso form. So, the (2R,3S) configuration would make the molecule meso, so no optical activity.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think of a similar example: tartaric acid. (R,S) is the meso form. So if the substituents are arranged in a way that the molecule is symmetric, then it's a meso compound.

In this succinic acid case, if the two chiral centers are mirror images of each other, then it's meso. So, the (2R,3S) would be the same as (2S,3R) when mirrored, making it a meso compound. So, this compound isn't optically active. So that's 0.

Wait, but wait, the question says (2R,3S). If, as in the case of tartaric acid, (R,S) is meso, then this compound is meso and not active. So, this compound is not active.

4. (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid
Again, same base structure as compound 3: HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH, but now with both C2 and C3 as R configuration.

So, in this case, the configurations are both R. Are there any planes of symmetry here? Let me think. The molecule would have two R chiral centers. So, the substituents on each would be arranged in a way that doesn't mirror each other.

Hmm, if the two chiral centers are both R, then the molecule isn't symmetric. So, each has the same configuration, and without a plane of symmetry, the molecule would be chiral and thus optically active. So this compound is active. Count 1.

Wait a second, but wait: for a molecule to be meso, it's when the same substituents are arranged symmetrically. In this case, both C2 and C3 are R, so the arrangement isn't symmetric. So the molecule isn't meso, making it chiral. So yes, this compound is active. So count 3 active now.

5. (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol
This is a cyclohexanol derivative with a double bond at position 3. So the structure is a cyclohexene ring with an OH group on C1. The configuration is R.

Wait, but cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: the double bond is between C3 and C4 (since it's 3-en). So the structure is a six-membered ring with a double bond from C3 to C4, and an OH on C1.

But the question is whether this molecule has a chiral center. The OH is on C1. So is C1 a chiral center?

For C1 to be chiral, it must have four different substituents. So, what's attached to C1? Let me imagine the structure.

In cyclohex-3-en-1-ol, the C1 has the OH group, and is connected to C2 and C6 (in the ring) and perhaps a hydrogen.

Wait, cyclohexene is a six-membered ring with one double bond. So the positions are 1 (OH), 2, 3 (double bond to 4), 4, 5, 6.

So C1 is connected to:
- OH,
- C2,
- C6,
- and a hydrogen (since it's a cyclohexene, each carbon in the ring has two substituents from the ring and two hydrogens, except those with substituents like OH).

Wait, but wait: in a cyclohexane ring, each carbon is connected to two adjacent carbons, and two hydrogens. But when you have a double bond, the structure changes.

In the case of cyclohex-3-en-1-ol, C1 is connected to C2, C6, OH, and a hydrogen. Wait, but C1 is part of the ring. So in a cyclohexene, the substituents are arranged such that C1 has two adjacent ring carbons (C2 and C6), an OH group, and a hydrogen.

So, the four substituents on C1 are:
- OH,
- C2 (which is part of the ring),
- C6 (also part of the ring),
- H.

Wait, but in a ring, the substituents are adjacent, so perhaps the substituents are not all different.

Wait, in a cyclohexene, the ring is not necessarily chair conformations but in this case, perhaps the substituents are arranged as such. So, to determine if C1 is a chiral center, let's see:

Are the four substituents on C1 all different?

The substituents would be:
1. OH group,
2. C2 (which is part of the ring, so same as the ring structure),
3. C6,
4. H.

Wait, but C2 and C6 are each adjacent ring carbons. Are they the same in terms of substituents? In a cyclohexene, substituents on adjacent carbons can be different, but in this case, C2 and C6 might have different substituents based on the ring structure.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think: in cyclohexene, each carbon in the ring (except for the double bond) is connected to two other ring carbons and two hydrogens. So, C1 has two ring bonds (to C2 and C6), one OH, and one H. So, the substituents on C1 are:

- OH,
- CH2- (from C2),
- CH2- (from C6),
- H.

Wait, but wait, in reality, the substituents are more accurately described as the groups attached. So C1 is connected to C2 (which is CH2 in the ring, but perhaps with a substituent), C6 (same), OH, and H.

But for a chiral center, all four substituents must be different. So, if C1 has OH, two CH2 groups (from C2 and C6), and a H, then two substituents are the same (the two CH2 groups), making it not a chiral center. Therefore, C1 is not a chiral center, so the molecule isn't chiral, and thus not optically active. So this compound isn't active. Count remains at 3.

Wait, but wait, perhaps the double bond affects the substituents. So, in cyclohex-3-en-1-ol, the ring has a double bond from C3-C4, so that part is rigid. So, the substituents on C1 might be different because the double bond affects the structure.

Wait, perhaps C1 has substituents that are all different. Let me think again. C1 is connected to:

- OH,
- C2 (CH2 group, but perhaps attached to a double bond),
- C6 (also CH2, but from the other side),
- and a H.

Wait, but in a ring, the substituents on C2 and C6 might be different. For example, C2 is adjacent to the double bond, so its substituents (like C3) might have different groups. Hmm, but in this case, perhaps the substituents are:

- C2: connected to C1, C3, and two H's.
But C3 is part of the double bond, so perhaps C2 is a CH2 group.

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting stuck again. Alternatively, perhaps I should remember that in cyclohexanol derivatives, the OH is on a ring carbon, and that carbon is a chiral center if it has four different substituents.

Wait, in the case of cyclohexanol, the OH is on C1, which is connected to two CH2 groups (C2 and C6), a H, and the OH. So, substituents: two CH2s, H, and OH. Thus, the two CH2 groups are the same, making it not a chiral center. Therefore, in (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol, the C1 is not a chiral center, so the compound isn't chiral. So, no optical activity. So, it's 0 for this.

Wait, but wait, the question says (R) configuration. That implies that the molecule must have a chiral center with R configuration. So perhaps I was wrong in my earlier analysis. Because if the molecule has an R configuration, then it must have a chiral center. So maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should think again. Let me imagine the cyclohexene ring. The OH is on C1. The double bond is between C3 and C4. So the structure is a ring with the OH at C1, and a double bond between C3 and C4.

So, for C1, the substituents would be:

- OH,
- C2 (which is part of the ring and perhaps a CH2 group),
- C6 (another CH2),
- and a hydrogen.

Wait, but in a cyclohexene ring, the substituents on C2 and C6 might be different. For example, C2 is next to C3, which is part of the double bond. So, perhaps C2 has different substituents compared to C6.

Wait, perhaps C2 is attached to C3, which is double bonded to C4. So, C2 is a CH2 group, while C6 is a CH group because it's adjacent to C5, which is attached to C4 (double bonded to C3).

Wait, no, in a six-membered ring, each carbon is connected to two adjacent carbons. So, C2 is connected to C1 and C3. C3 is double bonded to C4, so C2 is connected to C1 (which has OH), C3 (part of double bond), and two H's.

Similarly, C6 is connected to C1 and C5. C5 is connected to C4 (which is double bonded to C3), so perhaps C5 is a CH2 group. So, C6 is connected to C1, C5, and two H's. So, C6 is a CH2 group.

Wait, but in that case, C1's substituents would be:

- OH,
- C2 (CH2),
- C6 (CH2),
- H.

So, C2 and C6 are both CH2 groups, so the substituents on C1 would have two CH2 groups, making it not a chiral center. Therefore, the molecule cannot have an R configuration on a non-existent chiral center. So perhaps this compound isn't chiral, and thus not active.

Wait, but the question states (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol, which implies that there is a chiral center with R configuration. So, maybe I was wrong earlier, and C1 is a chiral center. Let me try again.

In cyclohex-3-en-1-ol, C1 has four substituents: OH, two CH2 groups (C2 and C6), and H.

Wait, but if the two CH2 groups are not the same, then perhaps they are different. How? Because C2 is adjacent to the double bond, so perhaps it's a different environment than C6, which is adjacent to C5, which is connected to C4 (double bonded to C3). So, maybe C2 is a CH2 group but in a different environment than C6, making them not identical.

Wait, but for substituents to be different, their groups must be different. So, if C2 is attached to C3 (which is part of the double bond), and C6 is attached to C5 (which is attached to C4, which is part of the double bond), then perhaps C2 and C6 have different substituents. So, C2 is connected to C3 (double bond) and C1, whereas C6 is connected to C5 (which is connected to C4, which is double bonded to C3). So perhaps C2 and C6 are in different environments, making the substituents on C1 different.

Wait, but wait, the substituents on C1 are the actual groups attached, not their environment. So, C2 and C6 are each CH2 groups, but their connections are to different parts of the ring. So, when considering the substituents on C1, perhaps the two CH2 groups are different because they're connected to different carbons. Like, one is C2 (which is next to the double bond) and the other is C6 (which is next to C5, which is next to C4, which is part of the double bond). So, perhaps C2 and C6 are different in terms of their substituents beyond just being CH2.

Wait, but no, the substituents on C1 are the groups attached to it, not the groups attached to those carbons. So, the substituent from C2 is a single bond to a CH2 group. So, from C1's perspective, whether C2 is next to a double bond doesn't change the substituent attached to C1. Therefore, the substituent from C2 is a single CH2 group, same as the substituent from C6, which is also a CH2 group. So, in that case, the substituents on C1 would be:

- OH,
- CH2 (from C2),
- CH2 (from C6),
- H.

So, two substituents are the same (the two CH2's), so C1 isn't a chiral center. Therefore, the molecule can't have an R configuration, which suggests that perhaps the question has a typo, but I'll proceed with the assumption that I'm correct and this compound isn't active. So, it's 0 for this.

6. (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol
This is a cyclohexane ring with hydroxyl groups on C1, C3, and C5. The stereochemistry is 1s, 3s, 5s.

So, the molecule is a triol with three OH groups on alternating carbons in a six-membered ring. Let's determine if this molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it meso, or if it's chiral.

If all three OH groups are on the same face (all R or all S), then the molecule might have a plane of symmetry. Alternatively, if they are arranged in a way that creates a center of symmetry, it could be meso.

Wait, let's imagine the cyclohexane ring with OH groups on C1, C3, and C5. Each of these is s (so the same configuration, perhaps all pointing in the same direction).

But when you have three substituents on a ring, their arrangement can affect the symmetry. For example, if all three are the same configuration and positioned in a symmetric way, the molecule might be meso.

Alternatively, perhaps this molecule is not meso and is chiral.

Wait, let me think about the substituents. Each OH is on a carbon with two adjacent CH2 groups. So, for each OH, the substituents are:

Each C (1,3,5) has OH, and the adjacent carbons (2 and 6 for C1; 2 and 4 for C3; 4 and 6 for C5). Let me think about whether the molecule has a plane of symmetry.

If the OH groups are all on the same face (say, all axial), then the molecule might have a plane of symmetry. Alternatively, if they alternate, perhaps not.

Wait, but the configuration is (1s,3s,5s), which suggests that each OH is on the same face relative to the ring. So, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry through the center of the ring, making it a meso compound.

Alternatively, perhaps not. Let me think of another approach: the molecule's symmetry. If the three OH groups are arranged in a way that after rotation or reflection, the molecule looks the same, then it's not chiral.

But with three substituents, it's tricky. Let's imagine that the three OH groups are all on the same face. Then, the molecule would have a plane of symmetry going through the center of the ring, perpendicular to the ring's plane, perhaps. So, the molecule would be symmetric, making it meso and thus not chiral.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule isn't symmetric and thus is chiral. Let me think about an example. For instance, 1,3,5-cyclohexane-triol with all OH groups in the same configuration (all R or all S). Is that a meso compound?

Wait, 1,3,5-cyclohexane-triol would have three OH groups at 120-degree positions. If all are R, for example, then the molecule would have a plane of symmetry through the center, making it meso. So, in that case, the compound would be achiral.

But wait, what if the stereocenters are arranged such that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry? Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to count this as a chiral compound because there are three chiral centers and no plane of symmetry.

Wait, but wait, if all three OH groups are in the same configuration, the molecule may have a plane of symmetry. For example, if all OH are axial and pointing in the same direction, the molecule would have a center of symmetry, making it meso.

Wait, but another approach: the molecule has three chiral centers, each with the same configuration. Does that make it meso?

No, because meso requires a plane of symmetry. For example, a molecule with multiple chiral centers can be meso if it has a plane of symmetry. But in this case, perhaps the configuration (all s) doesn't create a plane of symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule isn't meso and thus is chiral, making it optically active.

Wait, but I'm not confident. Let me think: if all three OH groups are on the same face, perhaps the molecule can be superimposed on its mirror image, making it meso. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is chiral. Let me think about the number of stereoisomers. For three chiral centers, there are 2^3 = 8 possible stereoisomers. Some may be enantiomers, and some may be meso forms.

Wait, but in this case, the molecule has three chiral centers, which would have a possibility of being a meso compound. For example, if the configuration is (1s,3s,5s), which is same for all, perhaps the molecule is symmetric and thus meso.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule isn't symmetric, making it chiral.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck here. Maybe I should look for another approach. Let me consider whether the molecule has a plane of symmetry. If I draw the cyclohexane ring with OH groups on C1, C3, and C5, and all in the same configuration (s), perhaps the molecule is symmetric.

Wait, no, because each OH is on a different carbon, so a plane of symmetry would require that each OH has a mirror image, which isn't possible with three substituents. So, perhaps the molecule isn't symmetric, making it chiral.

Wait, but wait, if the ring has a three-fold axis of symmetry, perhaps the molecule would be symmetric. For example, if you rotate the ring 120 degrees, the OH groups would map onto each other. But in that case, perhaps the molecule is achiral.

Wait, but if the molecule can be rotated to look like its mirror image, it would be achiral. So, if the molecule has a three-fold axis and all OH groups are the same, then it would be achiral.

But I'm not entirely sure. Perhaps I should proceed under the assumption that this molecule is not meso and is thus chiral, making it optically active. So, count 4 active.

7. 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one
The structure is a cyclopentyl group attached to the first carbon of a butan-1-one. So, the structure is (cyclopentyl)C(O)CH2CH2CH3.

Wait, but the ketone is at position 1, so the structure is:

cyclopentyl-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH3.

Wait, but wait, butan-1-one is (CH2)3-C(=O)-R, so in this case, the R is cyclopentyl.

So, the molecule is:

cyclopentyl-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH3.

Now, does this molecule have any chiral centers? Let's see.

The carbonyl is at position 1. The adjacent carbons are:

- C1: cyclopentyl, ketone group, and two CH2 groups (probably). Wait, no, the structure is more accurately:

The carbonyl is on C1, which is connected to the cyclopentyl group and a CH2CH2CH3 chain.

So, the structure is:

O
||
C(cyclopentyl)-CH2-CH2-CH3.

Wait, but in this structure, the carbonyl carbon is C1, which is connected to the cyclopentyl group, the ketone oxygen, and two CH2 groups. So, the substituents on C1 are:

- cyclopentyl,
- ketone oxygen (double bond, so not a substituent),
- two CH2 groups.

Wait, no, the carbonyl carbon is sp² hybridized. So, C1 (the carbonyl carbon) is connected to:

- cyclopentyl group,
- ketone oxygen (double bond),
- and two CH2 groups (but wait, butan-1-one is (CH2)3-C(=O)-R, so the carbonyl is at the end).

Wait, perhaps I should draw it as:

R-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH3.

So, in this case, R is cyclopentyl. So, the carbonyl is at the end of the chain, attached to the cyclopentyl group.

So, the carbonyl carbon (C1) is connected to:

- cyclopentyl,
- O (double bond),
- and two CH2 groups.

Wait, but the carbonyl carbon is sp², so it's connected to three groups: cyclopentyl, O, and a CH2CH2CH3 group. No, wait, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, butan-1-one is CH2CH2CH2-C(=O)-R, perhaps? No, I think butan-1-one is (CH2)3-C(=O)-R, but that would be butan-4-one. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, butan-1-one would be:

CH3-CH2-CH2-C(=O)-R.

Wait, no, butanone can be at position 2 (butan-2-one) or position 1 (butan-1-one). But butan-1-one would be:

R-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3.

Wait, but that's pentan-1-one. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused again.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is (cyclopentyl) attached to the carbonyl group, which is at the first carbon of a four-carbon chain. So the structure would be:

cyclopentyl-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH2-.

Wait, but that's five carbons, which would be pentanone. Hmm, perhaps I should move on and focus on whether there's a chiral center.

The carbonyl carbon (C1) is sp² hybridized, so it can't be a chiral center. The adjacent carbon (C2), which is CH2, is connected to the carbonyl, and two CH2 groups. So, no chiral centers here. The other carbons are all CH2 or CH3, so no chiral centers. So, this molecule doesn't have any chiral centers and thus isn't optically active. So, 0 for this.

Wait, but wait, perhaps the cyclopentyl group is attached to a chiral center. Let me think. The cyclopentyl group is connected to the carbonyl carbon, which is sp², so it's not a chiral center. So, the molecule doesn't have any chiral centers. So, no optical activity.

Now, let's go back and recount:

1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene → 0
2. (3aR,7aS,E)-... → 1
3. (2R,3S)-... → 0
4. (2R,3R)-... → 1
5. (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol → 0
6. (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol → 1 (assuming chiral)
7. 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one → 0

Wait, so that gives 3 active compounds (number 2,4,6). But earlier I thought number 6 might be meso. Let me reevaluate.

Wait, for number 6, if all three OH groups are on the same face, the molecule might be symmetric. So, perhaps it's a meso compound. If that's the case, number 6 wouldn't be active. So, let's recount:

Number 2: 1 active
Number 4: 1 active
Number 6: 0 (meso)
Others: 0

So total active: 2.

Wait, but earlier I thought number 6 might be active, but perhaps it's meso.

Alternatively, perhaps the configuration (1s,3s,5s) makes it not meso. Let me think again.

If the three OH groups are arranged such that each is axial and on the same face, the molecule would have a plane of symmetry through the center of the ring, making it meso. So, in that case, it's not active.

So, with that, number 6 is meso, so not active. That brings the total to 2.

Wait, but let me think again. The molecule has three stereocenters, all s, arranged in a symmetric way. Does that symmetry make it meso?

In the case of 1,3,5-trihydroxycyclohexane, all in the same configuration, the molecule would have a plane of symmetry passing through the center of the ring, making it a meso compound. Therefore, it's not optically active.

So, the count is:

Active compounds: 2 (number 2 and 4)

Wait, but earlier, I thought number 2 is active, number 4 is active, and others not. So, two active compounds.

But the options given are: A)5, B)3, C)2, D)4.

So, the answer would be C)2.

Wait, but I think I made a mistake earlier with number 6. Let me think again. If the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it's meso. For 1,3,5-triol, if all OHs are on the same face, then yes, it's meso. So, no optical activity.

So, the only active compounds are numbers 2 and 4. So, the answer is 2, which is option C.

Wait, but wait, I think I made a mistake with number 6. Let me think about the molecule again.

If the three OH groups are all on the same face, then the molecule can be superimposed on its mirror image by a 180-degree rotation, making it meso. So, no optical activity. So, number 6 is not active.

So, number 2 and 4 are active. So, two compounds.

But wait, let me go back to number 6. If the configuration is (1s,3s,5s), does that arrangement create a plane of symmetry?

Imagine the cyclohexane ring with OH groups on C1, C3, and C5, all in the same configuration (s). So, each OH is pointing in the same direction, perhaps all axial. Then, the molecule would have a plane of symmetry that bisects the ring between C2 and C6, for example. So, reflecting across that plane would leave the molecule unchanged. Therefore, it's a meso compound and not chiral.

So, number 6 is not active.

So, the count is 2 active compounds: number 2 and 4.

So, the answer is option C)2.


To determine how many of the given compounds exhibit optical activity, we analyze each compound for the presence of chirality. A compound is optically active if it has at least one chiral center and is not a meso compound (a compound with multiple stereocenters but a plane of symmetry, making it achiral).

### Analysis of Each Compound:

1. **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**  
   This compound does not have any chiral centers because the carbon atoms involved in the double bond are sp² hybridized and do not have four distinct substituents.  
   **Optical activity:** No.

2. **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**  
   This bicyclic compound has two stereocenters at positions 3a and 7a, with configurations R and S, respectively. Since there is no plane of symmetry in the molecule, it is chiral and optically active.  
   **Optical activity:** Yes.

3. **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**  
   The molecule has two chiral centers at positions 2 and 3. However, due to the symmetry of the molecule, it is a meso compound and not optically active.  
   **Optical activity:** No.

4. **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**  
   This molecule has two chiral centers at positions 2 and 3, both with R configurations. The molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, making it chiral and optically active.  
   **Optical activity:** Yes.

5. **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**  
   The hydroxyl group is attached to a carbon atom in the cyclohexene ring. However, the carbon atom bonded to the hydroxyl group does not have four distinct substituents, so it is not a chiral center.  
   **Optical activity:** No.

6. **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**  
   This compound has three hydroxyl groups on a cyclohexane ring. Despite having three stereocenters, the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound and not optically active.  
   **Optical activity:** No.

7. **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**  
   This compound does not have any chiral centers because all carbons are either sp² hybridized (the carbonyl carbon) or do not have four distinct substituents.  
   **Optical activity:** No.

### Conclusion:
Out of the seven compounds, only **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione** and **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid** are optically active.
