Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over parallax to the fifth power. Hmm, wait, so the number of stars N is proportional to 1/(parallax)^5. So, N ∝ 1/plx^5. Right, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh wait, parallax (often denoted as 'p') is inversely proportional to distance. So p = 1/d, where d is the distance. Oh, but wait, in astronomy, parallax is usually measured in parsecs, and the formula is p (in arcseconds) = 1/d (distance in parsecs). So when d increases, p decreases.

So, the number of stars N is inversely proportional to p^5, which is the same as saying N is proportional to d^5 because p is 1/d. Let me write that down. N ∝ 1/p^5 → since p = 1/d, substitute that in: N ∝ (1/(1/d))^5 = d^5. So N is proportional to d^5. But wait, the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance. So that's like the differential change, right? Or wait, no, maybe it's about the number density as a function of distance. Or perhaps it's about the number of stars you observe
