Okay, so I've got this NMR and LC-MS question in front of me. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll think it through.

Alright, the question is about a small peptidic compound that's been synthesized. The 1H NMR shows two peaks for the same alpha-proton. These peaks have similar shifts and their integrals add up to 1H. Wait, so each integrates to about 0.5H or something? But they're the same as the expected molecule, except for these two peaks. Also, coupling isn't the issue because they ruled out spin-spin coupling.

Then there's the LC-MS part. It shows two peaks of equal intensity at elevated temperatures. Both have the same mass, matching the expected molecule. Hmm.

So, what's going on here?

The options are A to D. Let's think about each.

Option A: Contaminated with a precursor. Well, a precursor would have a different mass. But the question says the mass spectrum is the same. So if it's a precursor, the m/z would be higher because it's the starting material before cleavage or something. Since both LC-MS peaks have the same mass as expected, maybe this isn't it. Because if it's a mix with a higher mass, the MS would show a different peak. So probably not A.

Option B: Mixture of enantiomers. Enantiomers are mirror images, and in NMR, if the sample isn't chiral (like if you have a racemic mixture), you might not see splitting unless there's something else. Wait, but if the compound is chiral, then a racemic mixture doesn't split the peaks because the environments are identical for each enantiomer. So in 1H NMR, if you have a racemic mixture, the peaks would look the same as a pure sample because the protons are in the same environment. But in this case, the NMR shows two peaks for the same proton. Oh wait, wait! Maybe if the sample isn't pure, like it's a diastereomer mixture. Or maybe it's a different issue.

Wait, another thought: If the compound has an alpha proton that's in a diastereomeric environment, then in a racemic mixture, each enantiomer would have the same shift. So maybe that doesn't explain the two peaks.

Option C: 'Double coupling' during amide bond formation. Hmm, not sure what that means exactly. Amide bonds are usually formed via coupling reactions, like using HATU or EDCl. Could impurities form another amide? Or maybe some side product where another bond forms, leading to a different structure with the same mass. Wait, but the mass spectrum is the same. So that would require the same molecular formula. If it's a double coupling, maybe it's a dimer or something else. But the molecular weight would be double if it's a dimer, which doesn't fit because the mass matches the expected. So maybe C isn't the answer.

Option D: Mixture of diastereoisomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties, so their NMR spectra would show different shifts. But wait, in the question, the two peaks have similar chemical shifts. If they're diastereomers, the alpha-proton environment would be different, possibly leading to different shifts. But the problem states the shifts are similar. Hmm, but maybe in some cases, the diastereomers could have protons in very similar environments, leading to overlapping or close shifts. Or perhaps it's a case where the diastereomers are in a certain configuration that the protons are split in a way that causes two peaks. Wait, but the integral adds up to 1H. So each peak is about 0.5H? Maybe the diastereomers have the same number of protons, but in different environments, leading to two separate peaks. But if the diastereomers are present in equal amounts, that would make sense for the integral.

But wait, why would diastereomers have the same mass? Oh, wait, diastereomers have the same molecular formula, so same mass. So in the LC-MS, both would elute at same retention time if they're present as a single peak? Or wait, no. Diastereomers have different physical properties, so they would have different retention times in LC. But the question says LC-MS shows two peaks of equal intensity. Oh, but the same mass. So that would require the same molecular weight. So if D is correct, the mix is diastereomers with same mass, but different retention times. So two peaks in LC, same mass in MS.

Wait, but the question says the LC-MS shows two clearly defined peaks of equal intensity, same mass. So how could two different compounds have same mass? Oh, wait, same molecular formula. So same molecular weight. So diastereomers, but same mass. That makes sense.

So, the NMR shows two peaks for the same alpha proton. Why? Because diastereomers could have different coupling patterns. Or perhaps each diastereomer has a different environment for the alpha proton leading to two separate signals. But the question says the shifts are similar. Hmm.

Wait, but if the sample is a racemic mixture (enantiomers), then each enantiomer would have the same shift, so no splitting. So in that case, why would the NMR show two peaks? Maybe not B.

Alternatively, maybe it's a case of the crude compound having some byproduct, like an incorrect stereochemistry at a different position, leading to diastereomers. But then, in that case, the diastereomers would have different shifts. But the problem states the shifts are similar and the integrals add to 1H.

Wait, another angle: the N
