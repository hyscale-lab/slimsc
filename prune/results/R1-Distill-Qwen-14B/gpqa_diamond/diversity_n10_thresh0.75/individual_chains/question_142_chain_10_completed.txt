Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think through it step by step. The question is about the density matrix of a qubit and its geometrical position in qubit space. Hmm, let me break it down.

First, the density matrix given is ρ = (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). Wait, I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's mixed or in a statistical ensemble. So this ρ is a density matrix for a qubit.

I think about what the standard basis states |0> and |1> look like. Oh right, |0> is [1, 0]^T and |1> is [0, 1]^T. So when you take |0><0|, that should be the outer product of |0> with itself. Let me compute that: |0><0| is a 2x2 matrix with 1 in the top-left corner and 0s elsewhere. Similarly, |1><1| is a matrix with 1 in the bottom-right and 0s elsewhere.

So when I add these two matrices together, I get a 2x2 identity matrix. Because |0><0| is [[1,0],[0,0]] and |1><1| is [[0,0],[0,1]], adding them gives [[1,0],[0,1]], which is the identity matrix. Then, multiplying by 1/2, the density matrix ρ becomes (1/2) * I, where I is the identity matrix. So ρ is [[1/2, 0], [0, 1/2]].

Now, the question is about the geometrical position in qubit space. I'm a bit fuzzy on what this exactly refers to. Oh wait, I think this relates to the Bloch sphere representation. The Bloch sphere is a way to visualize qubit states, where pure states are on the surface and mixed states are inside.

For a single qubit, any state can be represented as a vector on the Bloch sphere. The density matrix of a pure state is a projector, like |ψ><ψ|, which would have a trace of 1 and be rank 1. But for a mixed state, like this one, the density matrix can't be written as a single projector and is instead a statistical mixture.

The density matrix ρ here is diagonal with both diagonal elements equal to 1/2. I remember that in the Bloch sphere formalism, a mixed state can be represented as a point at the origin, which is the completely mixed state. Because when the density matrix is (I/2), it's the maximally mixed state. So geometrically, that should correspond to the point at (0,0,0) in the Bloch sphere coordinates. Oh right, the Bloch vector r for a density matrix is given by the expectation values in the Pauli matrices. So r = [⟨X⟩, ⟨Y⟩, ⟨Z⟩], where X, Y, Z are the Pauli matrices.

Calculating these for ρ: Let's see. The expectation value of X is Tr(ρ X). X is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So ρ X is (1/2)[[0,1],[1,0]], same as X multiplied by 1/2. The trace of this is (1/2)(0 + 0) = 0. Similarly, Y is [[0,-i],[i,0]], and Tr(ρ Y) would also be zero. Z is [[1,0],[0,-1]], so ρ Z is (1/2)* [[1,0],[0,-1]]. The trace of this is (1/2)(1) + (1/2)(-1) = 0. So all components of the Bloch vector are zero, which places it at the origin.

Looking at the options, option C is r=(0,0,0), which must be the correct answer. Let me just make sure none of the other options make sense. Option A is (1,1,0)—that would be a point not at the origin, probably representing a mixed state but not the maximally mixed one. Option B is (0,0,1), which is the state |0>, but our density matrix isn't a pure state. Option D is (1,1,1), which would imply a state outside the Bloch sphere, which isn't possible because all states lie on or inside the unit sphere.

So yes, the correct answer should be option C.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents a mixed state, specifically the maximally mixed state for a single qubit. To analyze its geometrical position in qubit space, we use the Bloch sphere representation. In the Bloch sphere, the state of a qubit is represented as a vector \(\mathbf{r} = (x, y, z)\), where the components correspond to the expectation values of the Pauli matrices \(X\), \(Y\), and \(Z\), respectively. These are calculated as:

\[
x = \text{Tr}(\rho X), \quad y = \text{Tr}(\rho Y), \quad z = \text{Tr}(\rho Z),
\]

where \(X = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}\), \(Y = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{bmatrix}\), and \(Z = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix}\).

For the given \(\rho = \frac{1}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix}\), the expectation values are:

- \(\text{Tr}(\rho X) = \frac{1}{2} \text{Tr} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix} = 0\),
- \(\text{Tr}(\rho Y) = \frac{1}{2} \text{Tr} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{bmatrix} = 0\),
- \(\text{Tr}(\rho Z) = \frac{1}{2} \text{Tr} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix} = 0\).

Thus, the Bloch vector is \(\mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0)\), which corresponds to the origin in the Bloch sphere. This is the geometrical representation of the maximally mixed state.

Analyzing the options:
- **Option A**: \((1, 1, 0)\) corresponds to a mixed state but not the maximally mixed state.
- **Option B**: \((0, 0, 1)\) corresponds to the pure state \(\left|0\right\rangle\), which is not the case here.
- **Option C**: \((0, 0, 0)\) correctly represents the maximally mixed state.
- **Option D**: \((1, 1, 1)\) is outside the Bloch sphere and is not a valid qubit state.

The correct answer is **C**, as it matches the geometrical position of the given density matrix in qubit space.

Answer: C
