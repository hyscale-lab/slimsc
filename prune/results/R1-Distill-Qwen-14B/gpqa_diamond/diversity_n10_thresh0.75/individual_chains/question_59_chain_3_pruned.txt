Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with pH calculations, but I'll try to work through it. Let me read the question again.

The problem says: Determine the pH of a solution made by mixing 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH, 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, and 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2. The options are A to D.

Hmm. So, the first thing I remember is that when you mix acids and bases, they can neutralize each other. So I need to find out if there's excess acid or base after they react.

Wait, but CH3COOH is a weak acid, right? And HCl is a strong acid. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. So the reaction between them should be straightforward.

I think the steps are: 

1. Calculate moles of each acid and base.
2. Find out how much reacts and what remains after neutralization.
3. Determine if the solution is acidic or basic based on the excess.
4. Calculate the pH based on the excess.

Let me start by calculating moles for each.

First, the volumes are in mL, but I'll convert them to liters for molarity calculations.

CH3COOH: 500 mL = 0.5 L. Moles = Molarity * Volume = 0.1 M * 0.5 L = 0.05 moles.

HCl: 400 mL = 0.4 L. Moles = 0.2 M * 0.4 L = 0.08 moles.

Ba(OH)2: 300 mL = 0.3 L. Moles = 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 moles.

Wait, Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so each mole contributes 2 moles of OH- ions. Because Ba(OH)2 dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2 OH^-.

So, moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2: 0.09 moles * 2 = 0.18 moles.

Now, looking at the acids. Both CH3COOH and HCl are acids. HCl is a strong acid, so it will completely dissociate, providing 0.08 moles of H+.

CH3COOH is a weak acid, so it won't completely dissociate. But when calculating neutralization, I think only the H+ from HCl and the OH- from Ba(OH)2 will react. The CH3COOH will react with the remaining OH- if any, but since it's a weak acid, maybe the OH- could have a significant effect.

Wait, maybe I should approach this by considering all the H+ and OH- contributions.

So, the total H+ comes from HCl and any excess after reactions. The OH- comes from Ba(OH)2 and any excess after reactions.

Wait, but the strong acids and bases will react first, and any excess will determine the pH.

So, let's think about the neutralization between HCl and Ba(OH)2.

HCl is H+ and Cl-; Ba(OH)2 gives Ba^2+ and 2 OH^-.

The reaction between H+ and OH- is H+ + OH- → H2O.

So, moles of H+ from HCl: 0.08 moles.

Moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2: 0.18 moles.

So, when you mix them, the OH- will neutralize the H+.

The H+ is 0.08; OH- is 0.18. So, all 0.08 H+ will react with 0.08 OH-, leaving 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 moles of OH-.

Now, after that, there's still the CH3COOH in the solution. CH3COOH is an acid, and the remaining OH- is a base. They will react: CH3COOH + OH- → CH3COO^- + H2O.

So, how much CH3COOH do we have? 0.05 moles.

We have 0.10 moles of OH- left after the HCl and Ba(OH)2 reaction. So, the OH- will react with CH3COOH.

So, moles of OH-: 0.10, moles of CH3COOH: 0.05. So, all 0.05 moles of CH3COOH will react with 0.05 moles of OH-, leaving 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 moles of OH-.

Wait, that's right. So after the reaction, the remaining OH
