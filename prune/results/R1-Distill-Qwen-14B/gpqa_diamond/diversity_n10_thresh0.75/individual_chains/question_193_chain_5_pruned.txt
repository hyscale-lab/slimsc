Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it. Let's see what the question is.

The problem says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over parallax to the fifth power. So, number of stars N is proportional to 1/(parallax)^5. Wait, so N ‚àù 1/plx^5. Hmm, I think I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, parallax (in parsecs) is inversely proportional to distance. So if the distance r increases, parallax plx decreases.

The question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range. So, we need to find how N varies with r. Let me think about the relationships here.

Parallax plx is equal to 1 divided by distance in parsecs. So plx = 1/r. Wait, but wait, in the formula, it's 1/plx^5, so substituting plx with 1/r, we get 1/( (1/r)^5 ) which is r^5. So number of stars N is proportional to r^5. So the number of stars increases with the fifth power of distance? But wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, wait, no. Because if N is proportional to 1/plx^5, and plx is 1/r, then 1/plx is r. So 1/(plx^5) is (r)^5. So N is proportional to r^5. So as distance r increases, the number of stars increases with r^5. But wait, that would mean that as you look further away, you see more stars. But that doesn't make sense because, in reality, as you go further, each shell has more volume but fewer stars per volume. Or maybe not? Wait, maybe in this problem, the way the number of stars is distributed is different.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let's model this out. The number of stars N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5. But plx is 1/r. So 1/(plx) is r. So 1/(plx)^5 is r^5. So N is proportional to r^5. So for each unit increase in r, N increases by r^5. But wait, the question is about how N changes with distance, per unit range. So maybe they are asking about the rate of change,
