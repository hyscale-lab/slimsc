Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I remember a bit from my studies, but I'm a bit rusty. Let me think this through.

The question is about finding the mean decay distance of a meson X. I know that the mean decay distance depends on the lifetime of the particle and its velocity. The formula I think is something like c multiplied by the lifetime (tau) times the velocity (beta c), right? So the mean distance L is L = beta * c * tau.

But wait, how do I find the lifetime tau from the given data? Oh right, the width of the resonance is related to the lifetime. I remember the uncertainty principle here. The product of the width (Gamma) and the lifetime (tau) is on the order of hbar, but wait, the exact relation is Gamma * tau = ħ, because of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. So tau is approximately ħ divided by Gamma.

Wait, but the units are a bit tricky. Oh right, because Gamma is the energy width, and tau would be in seconds. So I need to make sure the units work out.

So the steps I think are:

1. Calculate the lifetime tau using Gamma. Tau = ħ / Gamma.
2. Find the velocity beta using the energy and mass of the meson.
3. Then calculate the mean decay distance L = beta * c * tau.

Let me break it down.

First, Gamma is given as 320 MeV. I need to convert that into Joules, but wait, perhaps it's easier to work in units where ħ and c are known constants, like in natural units. Wait, but no, because the answer requires meters, so I probably need to convert all units properly.

Wait, another approach: perhaps using the relation between the width and the lifetime. Gamma is the total decay width, which is related to the mean lifetime by Gamma = ħ / tau. So tau = ħ / Gamma. But since Gamma is given in GeV, and ħ is in J·s, I'll need to convert units.

Wait, but maybe it's better to compute using natural units where c=1, ħ=1, etc., and then convert to SI units at the end. Let me think.

The mass m_X is 1.2 GeV, production energy E_X is 8 GeV. Wait, for a meson, the energy could be much higher than its rest mass. Hmm, but how does that affect the
