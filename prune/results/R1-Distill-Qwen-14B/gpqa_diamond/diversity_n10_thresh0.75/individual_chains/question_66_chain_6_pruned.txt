Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Hmm, I need to figure out which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT symmetries. Let me think through each one.

First, what's SMEFT? From what I remember, SMEFT is a framework that generalizes the Standard Model by adding higher-dimensional operators. It's used to include possible new physics beyond the SM in a systematic way. These operators are classified by their dimension, like dimension 6, 7, etc.

Now, the question is about symmetries. Symmetries in physics are crucial because they dictate the form of the laws and the possible interactions. So which symmetries must all operators in SMEFT respect?

Let's look at each option:

1. Lorentz Symmetry. Well, the Standard Model itself is Lorentz-invariant. SMEFT is built upon the SM, so I think all operators in SMEFT must respect Lorentz symmetry. They can't introduce terms that break this, because that would make the theory inconsistent with relativity. So option 1 is probably correct.

2. Poincare Symmetry. Poincare includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations (like shifting space and time). The SM respects Poincare, and SMEFT should too. Wait, but does SMEFT necessarily respect all of Poincare? Or could some operators break some parts? Hmm. Wait, in SMEFT, the operators are constructed from the SM fields, which themselves transform under Poincare. So the operators must be Poincare-invariant. Therefore, I think option 2 is also correct. So options 1 and 2 are both correct. But wait, I thought that Poincare includes Lorentz, so maybe the question is phrased such that one could be included in the other. So the question is asking which must be respected by all operators. But I think both must be.

Wait, but wait a second. SMEFT allows for higher-dimension operators. Do these operators necessarily preserve all Poincare symmetries? Let me think. Suppose an operator breaks translational symmetry. That would mean the theory isn't Lorentz-invariant either, because translations are part of Poincare. But in SMEFT, the operators are local, meaning they don't break global symmetries. Wait,
