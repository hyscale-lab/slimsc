Okay, so I've got this question about the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT), and I'm trying to figure out which symmetries must be respected by all operators. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The options are 1 to 4, and the choices are combinations of these. The question is about symmetries that all operators in SMEFT must respect. Let me list what I remember.

First, SMEFT is an effective theory that extends the Standard Model by adding higher-dimensional operators. These operators are organized by their dimension and the symmetries they respect.

I think SMEFT respects the gauge symmetry of the Standard Model, which includes SU(3), SU(2), and U(1) groups. But the question is about other symmetries, like Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT.

Wait, Lorentz Symmetry (option 1) is definitely important. Because all the Standard Model interactions are Lorentz-invariant, right? So the SMEFT, being an effective theory that incorporates the SM, should also respect Lorentz symmetry. Therefore, all operators must be Lorentz scalars or form part of a tensor structure that respects Lorentz symmetry. So 1 is a must.

Poincare Symmetry (option 2) is another one. Poincare includes Lorentz and translations. But wait, SMEFT is a field theory, so it's built in a way that respects local symmetries, like Poincare. So all operators should be Poincare invariant. So 2 must also be respected. So options 1 and 2 are both correct.

Now, what about CP (option 3) and CPT (option 4)? I think that in the Standard Model, CP is not a symmetry (except for some parts, like electromagnetism), but in general, the SM doesn't respect CP. Wait, but the SMEFT is a general effective theory that allows for operators that may or may not respect certain symmetries. So the question is, must all operators respect these?

Wait, no. The SMEFT doesn't necessarily require the operators to respect CP. Because the SM already has CP violation (like in the CKM matrix), so SMEFT should allow for operators that break CP. So operators in SMEFT can violate CP. So option 3 is not a must.

But what about CPT symmetry (option 4)? CPT is a fundamental symmetry in quantum field theory. Every QFT that
