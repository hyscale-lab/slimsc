Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. It's a bit tricky, but I'll try to break it down step by step. Let me read through it again and see what I can figure out.

The question is about binary compounds of fluorine with element Y. Five such compounds are known. So, Y is some element that forms five different fluorides. Hmm, elements that form multiple fluorides... I'm thinking maybe something like sulfur or chlorine, but let me think more about the other clues.

The first substance is A1, which is bright red and decomposes at 293 K (which is room temperature, about 25°C) into A2 and fluorine. Also, A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions. So, A1 must be a strong oxidizing agent. When it decomposes, it forms A2. They give the oxygen-fluorine equivalent (ɷF) of A2 as 31.96%. Oxygen-fluorine equivalent is a measure of the oxidizing power, right? So if it's 31.96%, that suggests a certain oxidation state.

Wait, what's oxygen-fluorine equivalent? Oh, right, it's a way to compare the oxidizing strength of a substance to that of fluorine. So if A2 has an ɷF of 31.96%, that means it can replace 31.96% of fluorine's oxidizing power. So maybe A2 is a weaker oxidizing agent than A1.

A3 can also interact with xenon. A3 is obtained by fluorinating Y. So Y and fluorine react to form A3. So A3 is one of the fluorides of Y. Since Y forms five binary fluorides, perhaps Y is in group 17 or 16? Wait, group 17 elements have multiple fluorides, like chlorine with ClF, ClF3, etc. Or maybe group 16, like sulfur with SF2, SF4, SF6.

Wait, the first part says A1 is bright red. That makes me think of something like KMnO4, which is purple, but wait, that's a salt, not a binary compound. Oh, wait, perhaps it's a metal fluoride. Alternatively, maybe A1 is something like OF2, but that's a gas, not sure if it's bright red. Or perhaps it's a diatomic molecule. Wait, another idea: iodine's color is dark purple, but not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a manganese compound. Hmm, maybe not. Let me think about other red compounds.

Another thought: maybe A1 is a fluorinated oxygen compound. Wait, but the question is about binary compounds of fluorine and Y. So Y is the other element. So Y is in a compound with F.

Wait, another angle: the decomposition of A1 produces fluorine. So A1 must contain F and Y. When it decomposes, it releases F2. So perhaps A1 is YF3 or another compound. Let me think: suppose A1 is YF5. If YF5 decomposes, maybe into YF4 and F2? Or perhaps into YF3 and F2. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe A1 is YF4, which decomposes into YF2 and F2?
