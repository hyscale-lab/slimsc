Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to understand what's going on. 

The question says that a chemist did two reactions using two different reducing agents on two unknown compounds, A and B. The products are both (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. Wait, no, actually, looking again, the first reaction gives (R)-, and the second gives (S)-. Because the first equation is A + LiBH4 + H+ → (R)-..., and the second is B + BH3 + H+ → (S)-... So depending on which reagent is used, the configuration of the product changes.

So the products are both the same compound but enantiomers because of the R and S labels. So the two products are enantiomers of each other. That means the starting materials A and B must have been such that their reduction leads to opposite configurations.

I remember that the reduction of ketones can lead to the formation of alcohols. But wait, in this case, the product is a tetrahydro-pyranone, which is a cyclic ether with an oxygen and a ketone. Hmm, so maybe the starting materials are some kind of ethers or esters, and the reaction is a reduction that forms the ring?

Wait, wait. Think about the products: 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. Pyran is a six-membered ring with one oxygen. So the structure would be a cyclic ether with five carbons and an oxygen. The ketone is at position 2, and there's an ethyl group at position 4.

So, the product is a cyclic hemiacetal or something similar. Wait, no, pyran is a cyclic ether. So 2H-pyran-2-one would have the ketone at position 2. So the structure is a six-membered ring with O at position 1, and a ketone at position 2. The substituents are ethyl at position 4.

Now, the reactions are using LiBH4 and BH3 as reducing agents. Wait, but LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, often used to reduce carbonyl groups. BH3 is typically used in hydroboration, which is an addition reaction,
