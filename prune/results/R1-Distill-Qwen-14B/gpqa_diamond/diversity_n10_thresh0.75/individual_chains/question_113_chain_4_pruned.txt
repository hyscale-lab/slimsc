Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about identifying an unknown compound based on its spectral data. Let me try to work through this step by step.

First, the question gives me several pieces of information from different spectroscopic techniques: FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The options are different chemical formulas, so I need to figure out which one fits all the given data.

Starting with the FTIR data. The broad peak at 3000 cm-1 suggests either O-H stretching (like in alcohols or carboxylic acids) or N-H, but since the options don't have nitrogen, I'll stick with O-H. The broadness usually indicates hydrogen bonding, which is common for alcohols or maybe something like a carbonyl with adjacent O-H, like a ketone or aldehyde. But wait, there are also strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm-1. The 1700 is a strong indicator of a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe a carboxylic acid. The 1650 might be another carbonyl or possibly an aromatic ring, like conjugated carbonyl groups or maybe an amide, but again, the options don't have nitrogen, so probably it's a carbonyl.

Wait, but if there's a broad peak at 3000, perhaps it's an alcohol. So maybe the compound has both a carbonyl and an alcohol group. Alternatively, maybe a conjugated carbonyl, like an ester or a ketone with some conjugation.

Looking at the NMR: several peaks, including vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are those attached to a double bond, like in alkenes. So the compound has an alkene group. That's another functional group to consider.

The Mass Spec shows a fragment peak at m/z=45. Hmm, 45 is a common mass for certain functional groups. Let me think about possible fragments. Methyl groups (15) plus something else? Wait, 45 could be the tropylium ion (C7H7+), but that's more for arenes. Alternatively, maybe a CH3CO+ fragment. CH3CO is 43, but wait, that's 43. Hmm. Another possibility is a ketone, like if the molecule breaks off a (CH2) group. Or perhaps a fragment like (CH2)2O, but I'm not sure.

Wait, 45 as a mass. Let me think of possible groups. The formula for (CH3)2CO (acetone) is C3H6O. The molecular ion for acetone is 58, but perhaps a fragment could be smaller. Alternatively, maybe a CH2CHO+ group (formaldehyde with something attached), but that's 30. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: the molecular formula options are C6H12O, C6H10O, C6H10O2, C6H12O2.

So let's see:

Option A: C6H12O2. Degrees of unsaturation: For C6H12O2, the formula is CnH2mOx. So degrees of unsaturation = (2n +2 - m -x)/2. So n=6, m=12, x=2. So (2*6 +2 -12 -2)/2 = (14-14)/2 = 0. So zero degrees, which would mean fully saturated. But the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, which implies a double bond, so at least one degree of unsaturation. So this can't be right. Unless I'm miscalculating.

Wait, wait, the formula is C6H12O2. For H, it's 12, which for a molecule with 6 carbons, the maximum H is 14 (if all single bonds and no rings). So 12 H implies less than maximum. So the formula would have (2(6)+2 -12 - 2)/2 = (14-14)/2=0. So no rings or double bonds. But the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, which are from a double bond. So this can't be. So option A is out.

Option B: C6H10O. Degrees of unsaturation: (2*6 +2 -10 -1)/2 = (14-11)/2= (3)/2=1.5? Wait, that can't be. Wait, wait, the formula is 2n+2 - m -x, divided by 2. Wait, no, the correct formula is Degrees of Unsaturation = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no X or N here, so (2*6 +2 -10 -0)/2 = (14-10)/2=4/2=2. So 2 degrees. Which could be one double bond and one ring, or two double bonds, etc
