Okay, so I have this chemistry problem to solve, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question says that an unknown compound has been characterized using FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The FTIR shows a very broad peak around 3000 cm-1, which I think usually indicates O-H stretching. Then there are strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm-1. Hmm, those are in the range of carbonyl groups. 1700 is typical for a ketone or maybe an ester, and 1650 could be conjugated carbonyls or possibly an aromatic ring with some substitution, like an aromatic ketone or something with conjugation.

The 1H NMR shows peaks for vinyl hydrogens, which means there are double bonds. So the compound has some sort of unsaturation, maybe alkenes. Mass spec shows a fragment at m/z 45. I remember that m/z 45 could correspond to something like a ketone fragment, maybe a CH3CO+ ion, which is 45. Or perhaps a CH2CH2O+ or something similar. But I'm not entirely sure. Also, m/z 45 is a common fragment for a ketone group.

The possible formulas are C6H12O, C6H10O, C6H10O2, and C6H12O2. So, I need to figure out which formula fits all the given data.

Let me think about the IR again. The broad peak at 3000 is likely O-H, so the compound has either an alcohol, carboxylic acid, or maybe an ether. Wait, but ethers don't have O-H. So probably an alcohol or carboxylic acid. But if it's a carboxylic acid, the O-H would be very broad, but in that case, the carbonyl (C=O) peak would be around 1700. Wait, but then why is there another peak at 1650? Hmm, maybe it's an ester or a conjugated carbonyl.

Wait, another thought: 1700 could be an ester or a ketone. The 1650 could be conjugated double bonds, like an aromatic ring with substituents. Or perhaps it's an amide, but the options don't have nitrogen, so likely not. So maybe the compound has two carbonyl groups? But wait, the options don't have O2 unless it's one of the O2 options.

Looking at the options:

A) C6H12O2
B) C6H10O
C) C6H10O2
D) C6H12O

So, if the IR has two carbonyl peaks, maybe the compound has two different carbonyl groups, like an ester and a ketone or something. Alternatively, maybe one is from a conjugated system, like an aromatic ring with carbonyls.

Wait, but I think that 1700 is more like an ester or a ketone, and 1650 could be an aromatic
