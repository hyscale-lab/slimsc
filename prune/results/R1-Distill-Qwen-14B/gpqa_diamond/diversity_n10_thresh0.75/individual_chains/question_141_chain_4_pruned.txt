Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is.

The question says: 1-bromobenzene-2-d is treated with NaNH2 in condensed ammonia solvent. How many possible organic products are there in this reaction? The options are A)4, B)1, C)2, D)3.

Wait, wait a second. I'm a bit confused about the structure here. The compound is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. Hmm, wait, maybe it's a typo. Oh, wait, perhaps it's 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene or something like that? Or maybe 1-bromo-2-methylbenzene. No, wait, maybe it's 1-bromo-2,3-dichlorobenzene. Wait, the structure isn't clear to me. Oh, wait, the question probably meant 1-bromobenzene-2-d, but maybe it's another substituent arrangement. Alternatively, maybe it's 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene. Oh, wait, perhaps it's 1-bromo-2,4-dichlorobenzene. But maybe the "d" stands for something else. Wait, perhaps it's a typo, and it's 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene. Or maybe it's 1-bromo-2-methylbenzene. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the compound is 1-bromo-2,3,4
