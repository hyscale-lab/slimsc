Okay, I need to solve this quantum mechanics problem about a diatomic molecule transitioning between states. Hmm, let's see. The molecule is modeled using the rotation-vibration model, and it's in its fundamental state. We need to find the momentum of a photon that will cause it to switch to the next lowest energy state.

Wait, the fundamental state is probably the lowest energy state, right? So the next state would be the first excited state. But I'm a bit confused about whether this transition involves a change in rotation, vibration, or both. Oh, because the model is a rotation-vibration model, which I think combines both rotational and vibrational states.

So the problem is about the molecule absorbing a photon and moving to the next possible state. That should be the first excited state. But wait, in quantum mechanics, each state is characterized by quantum numbers. For rotation, the quantum number is J (angular momentum), and for vibration, it's the vibrational quantum number ν.

In the fundamental state, I think the molecule would be in the ground state for both rotation and vibration. So the vibrational state ν is 0 (ground) and the rotational state J is also 0 (since that's the lowest). But wait, wait—no, for diatomic molecules, the rotational ground state is J=0, but sometimes the rotational state might be J=1 if it's a rigid rotor, but wait, the non-rigid rotor? Hmm, no, the non-rigid rotor is more about the bond length changing during rotation. Oh right, the rotation-vibration coupling model allows for the bond length to change due to vibration, affecting the rotational energy levels.

But the question is about the transition when a photon is absorbed. So the molecule goes from its fundamental state (probably the lowest vibrational and rotational state) to the next higher state. But what's the next higher state? It depends on whether the photon causes a change in rotation, vibration, or both. Since the question is about the next possible state with the lowest energy, perhaps it's the first excited vibrational state, or maybe the first excited rotational state, whichever has a lower energy.

Wait, but in quantum mechanics, energy levels can have multiple states. The next state after the fundamental might not be a single quantum number change but the next energy level overall. So perhaps the energy levels are ordered such that the first excited state is either the next vibrational state (ν=1) or the next rotational state (J=1). But which one has a smaller energy?

Hmm, I need to figure
