Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, I remember that EDTA forms complexes with metal ions. The question says the solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Oh wait, and the K for this complex is given as 5x10^10. I need to find the concentration of calcium ions.

Wait, so the Ca-EDTA complex is CaY²-? Or maybe it's another form? Well, I think EDTA has several protonated forms, but the question says the pH is ideal, so maybe all the EDTA is in the form that can bind Ca²+.

The complex is stoichiometric, so each Ca²+ binds one EDTA. So the formula is probably CaY, but I'm not sure about the charge. Anyway, the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. So initially, that's 0.02 M of CaY²- or whatever the complex is.

But I need to find [Ca²+] in solution. Oh, right, because the complex dissociates a little. The formation constant, K, is given as 5e10, which is a pretty large value, so the complex is very stable. But wait, what's the exact expression for K?

Formation constant K is usually written as [CaY²-]/([Ca²+][EDTA]). Wait, no, K is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. So for the reaction Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA²-.

So K = [CaEDTA²-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]).

But in the solution, the main species is the complex. So when it dissociates, it can release Ca²+ and EDTA^4-.

Wait, but the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. So let's assume that the complex dissociates as:

CaY²- ↔ Ca²+ + Y^4-.

But wait, the formation reaction was Ca²+ + Y^4- → CaY²- with K given. So the dissociation would have K_dissociation = 1/K, which in this case is 1/(5e10) = 2e-11.

But wait, another approach: the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, so let me let the concentration of CaY²- be 0.02 M at the start. But it will dissociate a little, so let x be the concentration of Ca²+ formed from dissociation. So:

At equilibrium:
[CaY²-] = 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02 (since K is so large, x will be very small, right? Because K is 5e10, so the complex is very stable, so x is negligible compared to 0.02.)

Wait, no, wait. Wait, K is very large. So the complex is very stable, meaning it doesn't dissociate much. So x would be very small, so 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

So the expression for K would be [CaY²-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]) = 5e10.

But at the same time, the amount of EDTA comes from the dissociation. So EDTA^4- is x. Because for each mole of CaY²- that dissociates, you get one mole of EDTA^4- and one mole of Ca²+.

Wait, but the initial concentration of EDTA is zero, because all the EDTA is in the complex. So the only source of EDTA is from the dissociation of the complex.

So [EDTA^4-] = x, and [Ca²+] = x.

So substituting into the K expression:

(0.02) / (x * x) ) = 5e10.

So 0.02 / x² = 5e10.

Then x² = 0.02 / (5e10) = 2e-12 /5e10? Wait, no, 0.02 is 2e-2, so 2
