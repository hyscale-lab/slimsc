Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing a certain concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex. Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, which forms complexes with metal ions like calcium.

The problem states that the solution has 0.02 M of the stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Oh, wait, stoichiometric means that the ratio is 1:1, right? So each formula unit of Ca-EDTA contains one Ca²+ ion and one EDTA^4- ion. Right, because EDTA typically has a charge of -4 when it's deprotonated enough to form complexes.

The temperature is given as 25°C, which is room temperature, and the pH is ideal, so I don't have to worry about other protonation states of EDTA. The stability constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10. I think the stability constant (formation constant) tells us how stable the complex is. A high K like 5e10 means the complex is very stable, so it dissociates very little.

The question is asking for the concentration of calcium ions in the solution. So, if the Ca-EDTA complex dissociates, the Ca²+ concentration would be very low because the complex is so stable. 

Wait, but the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. So, the solution has Ca-EDTA at 0.02 M, which doesn't dissociate much because the K is so large. So, the dissociation can be considered negligible, except for a tiny amount.

Let me think about the dissociation equation. The complex dissociates as:

Ca-EDTA ↔ Ca²+ + EDTA^4-

The formation constant K is given by [Ca²+][EDTA^4-] / [Ca-EDTA]. But wait, K is the formation constant, so the equilibrium expression for the dissociation would be the inverse, right? So, the dissociation constant K_d (dissociation) is 1/K. Because K is the formation, and K_d is 1/K.

So, K_d = 1/(5e10) = 2e-11.

Wait, no, wait. Let me make sure. The formation constant is K = [Ca-EDTA]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]). So when the complex dissociates, the expression for the dissociation (which is K_d) is [Ca²+][EDTA^4-]/[Ca-EDTA] = 1/K.

So, K_d = 1/(5e10) = 2e-11 approximately.

Now, let's let x be the concentration of Ca²+ ions that dissociate from the complex. At equilibrium, the concentration of Ca-EDTA would be approximately 0.02 - x, but since K_d is so small, x will be really tiny compared to 0.02, so 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02. 

So, the concentration of Ca²+ would be x, and EDTA^
