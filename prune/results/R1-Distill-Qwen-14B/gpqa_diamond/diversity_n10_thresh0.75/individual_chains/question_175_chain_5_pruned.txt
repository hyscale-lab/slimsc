Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about oscillating charges and radiation. Hmm, I remember that oscillating charges can radiate electromagnetic waves, and the shape of the distribution affects the radiation pattern. The question is a bit tricky, but let's break it down.

The problem says the charge distribution is spheroidal with the symmetry axis along the z-axis. So I'm picturing something like a prolate spheroid, maybe? Because it's oscillating, it radiates at a wavelength λ. The question is about the radiated power per unit solid angle as a function f of λ and θ, the angle from the z-axis.

The maximum power is A. They're asking what fraction of A is radiated at θ=30 degrees, and what the possible form of f is.

I remember that for a dipole radiator, the radiation pattern is a function of the angle. The power pattern for a dipole typically has a certain dependence. Wait, for an oscillating dipole, the radiation pattern is given by the dipole formula. The power radiated per unit solid angle (like the intensity) depends on the angle θ.

Wait, the dipole's radiation is maximum at the equator, so at θ=90 degrees, right? Because the dipole's field is strongest perpendicular to its axis. But wait, wait, no: for a dipole, the radiation is strongest perpendicular to the axis of oscillation. So if the dipole is along the z-axis, the maximum intensity is at θ=90 degrees, not along the axis. So the power per unit solid angle should be maximum there.

But wait, in this problem, the maximum power is A. So A is the maximum value of f, which is the power per unit solid angle. So when θ is 30 degrees, what fraction of A is that?

Hmm, the radiation pattern for a dipole is given by something like (sinθ)^2, or maybe proportional to (1 + cosθ)^2
