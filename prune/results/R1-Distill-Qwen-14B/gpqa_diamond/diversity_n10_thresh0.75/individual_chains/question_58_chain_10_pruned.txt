Okay, so I've got this physics question here, and I need to figure out which theory doesn't require regularization at high energies. Hmm, let me think about what each option is.

The question is about whether a particular physical theory needs regularization when energies are high. Regularization, as I remember, is a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with divergencesâ€”like infinities that pop up in calculations. It's a way to make the math work by introducing a temporary cutoff or some other method to handle these infinities, and then you take the cutoff away at the end.

So the options are A) Superstring Theory, B) Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), C) Quantum Electrodynamics (QED), and D) Classical Electrodynamics.

First, I should probably go through each option one by one.

Starting with option D, Classical Electrodynamics. That's the theory described by Maxwell's equations, right? It's a classical theory, so it doesn't involve quantum mechanics. Since it's not a quantum field theory, it doesn't have the same issues with divergences that quantum theories do. Wait, but does it require regularization? I don't think so. Classical theories usually don't need renormalization or regularization because they aren't dealing with the same kinds of infinities that quantum theories do. So maybe D is the answer, but let me check the others.

Option C is QED. QED is a quantum field theory that deals with electrons and photons. I remember that QED does have issues with divergent integrals when calculating things like the electron self-energy. So regularization is used here. For example, using a cutoff or dimensional regularization to handle those divergences before renormalization. So QED does require regularization, so C isn't the correct answer.

Option B is QCD, which is the theory of the strong interaction. QCD is a non-abelian gauge theory, similar to QED but with more complex interactions because of the color charge. Like QED, it's a quantum field theory and it has its own set of divergences. So regularization is definitely needed here. For instance, lattice QCD sometimes uses regularization, but even without that, the perturbative calculations would require it. So B is not the correct answer.

Option A is Superstring Theory. String theory is an attempt to unify quantum mechanics and general relativity, right? It posits that particles are not point-like but are instead tiny strings. Now, in string theory, I think that at high energies, or more precisely, when the energy scale is near the string scale, the theory doesn't have the same kinds of divergences that conventional quantum field theories do. Because strings are extended objects, the theory might avoid certain infinities. But wait, string theory itself is a background-dependent theory, though, and it's still a work in progress. I'm not entirely sure, but I remember that one advantage of string theory is that it doesn't have the same ultra-violet divergences as point particle theories. Because in string theory, the interactions are between strings, which have a length scale (the string length), so maybe it doesn't require regularization in the same way.

Alternatively, I might be mixing up things. Another thought: regularization is a tool used in quantum field theories to deal with divergences. String theory isn't formulated in the same way as a quantum field theory, so perhaps it doesn't require regularization. Or maybe it does in certain formulations. Hmm.

Wait, the question is about which theory never requires regularization. So if a theory doesn't have any divergences, it wouldn't need regularization. Classical theories, as I thought earlier, don't have these issues. Quantum theories, like QED, QCD, and even string theory, might require regularization.

But wait, in string theory, do they even use regularization? I think in some approaches, like perturbative string theory, maybe they calculate using methods that inherently avoid some divergences. Or perhaps they don't require the same kind of regularization as QFTs. Alternatively, maybe string theory's perturbative expansion is finite, avoiding the need for regularization.

Wait, no, string theory still has divergences in its perturbative expansion. For example,
