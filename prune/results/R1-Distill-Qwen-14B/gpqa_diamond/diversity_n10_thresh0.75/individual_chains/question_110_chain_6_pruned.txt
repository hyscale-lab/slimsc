Okay, so I have this astronomy question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question again. It's about which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. The key is to find stars that are within the brightness limits of both instruments.

From the question, I remember that ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes up to 17 mag, while HIRES can go up to 16 mag. So any star that's brighter than 17 mag can't be seen by ESPRESSO, but if it's brighter than 16, HIRES can't see it either. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the question says 'brighter than 17 mag' for ESPRESSO—so stars with V less than or equal to 17 mag can be observed. Similarly, for HIRES, it's brighter than 16, meaning V less than or equal to 16 mag. So a star needs to have V magnitude <=17 and <=16 for both to observe it. So the V mag must be <=16, because only then both can detect it. Because if a star is brighter than 16, ESPRESSO can see it (since 16<17), but HIRES can't. So the star must have V mag <=16 to be visible to both.

Wait, no, no. Let me get this right. The question states: "with ESPRESSO, stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed." Wait, brighter than 17 would mean magnitude less than 17, right? Because lower magnitude means brighter. So, stars with V mag <17 can be observed by ESPRESSO. Similarly, for HIRES, stars brighter than 16 V mag can be observed—so V mag <16.

So for a star to be detectable by both, it must have V mag less than 16. Because if it's brighter than 16 (<=16), then HIRES can see it, and since 16 is less than 17, ESPRESSO can see it too. But if a star is between 16 and 17, it can be seen by ESPRESSO but not by HIRES. So only stars with V mag <=1
