Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which stars can be detected by both ESPRESSO and HIRES spectrographs. Let me start by understanding the question.

The question says that ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. So, that means any star with a V mag less than or equal to 17 is observable. Similarly, HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag, so that's V mag less than or equal to 16. So, a star needs to be observable by both, meaning its apparent V magnitude has to be <=16 because HIRES's limit is lower.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the question says ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than 17 mag. So, the apparent V magnitude has to be less than or equal to 17 for ESPRESSO. And HIRES can observe stars up to 16 mag. So for a star to be detected by both, its apparent V magnitude must be <=16. Because if it's 16.5, then HIRES can't see it. So only stars with apparent V mag <=16 can be seen by both.

But wait, some stars have absolute magnitude, and some have apparent. So I need to calculate the apparent magnitude for stars that are given absolute magnitude and distance.

Let me look at each star:

Star1: Absolute V mag 15.5, distance 10 pc. Apparent mag is calculated using the distance modulus: m = M + 5 log
