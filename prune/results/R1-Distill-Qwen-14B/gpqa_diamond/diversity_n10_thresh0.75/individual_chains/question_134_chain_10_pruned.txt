Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the enthalpy of neutralization when these three solutions are mixed. Hmm, I remember that neutralization reactions involve acids and bases reacting to form water and a salt. The enthalpy change for this process is usually measured in kilojoules per mole or something like that.

The problem gives me three solutions: HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2. Wait, but wait, Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, right? And HCl and H2SO4 are strong acids. So when they mix, they'll neutralize each other. But I need to find out how much acid and base I have, and see which is in excess.

Let's list out each solution:

1. HCl: 500 mL of 0.2 M. So moles of HCl would be 0.5 L * 0.2 mol/L = 0.1 mol. But wait, HCl is a strong acid, so it dissociates completely, giving 0.1 mol H+.

2. H2SO4: 300 mL of 0.3 M. H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, but I think in aqueous solution it dissociates into 2 H+ and SO4^2- ions. So for each mole of H2SO4, there are 2 moles of H+. So moles of H2SO4 is 0.3 L * 0.3 mol/L = 0.09 mol. So H+ from H2SO4 is 0.18 mol.

3. Ba(OH)2: 200 mL of 0.5 M. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so it dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2 OH^- ions. So each mole gives 2 moles of OH-. So moles of Ba(OH)2 is 0.2 L * 0.5 mol/L = 0.1 mol. So OH- is 0.2 mol.

Now, the reaction between acid and base is H+ + OH- â†’ H2O. The enthalpy change for this is usually around -57 kJ per mole of H2O formed, but wait, wait, I think the standard enthalpy of neutralization is about -57 kJ/mol for strong acids and bases. But wait, H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, so each H+
