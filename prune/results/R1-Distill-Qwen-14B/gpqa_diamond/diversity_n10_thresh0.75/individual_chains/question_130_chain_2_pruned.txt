Okay, so I've got this question about neutral hydrogen clouds and quasars. Hmm, let me try to think through it. The question is about finding the lower limit on the redshift for these objects to be detected with optical ground-based telescopes.

I remember that Lyman alpha emission is at about 1216 Angstroms, which is in the ultraviolet range. But wait, the question says these clouds absorb the light from background quasars at that wavelength. So when the quasar's light passes through a hydrogen cloud, the hydrogen absorbs it at 1216 Angstroms.

Now, the quasar emits light across the spectrum, but when the cloud is in front, we see a absorption line at 1216. But wait, if the cloud is moving away from us (which it is, since it's in deep space and the universe is expanding), the wavelength we observe would be redshifted.

The key here is that the telescopes in question are optical. So, what's the range of optical wavelengths? I think optical is roughly from about 400 to 700 nanometers, or 4000 to 7000 Angstroms. Wait, 1 nanometer is 10 Angstroms, so 400 nm is 4000 Angstroms. Right.

So the quasar's emitted Lyman alpha is 1216 Angstroms. But when it's redshifted due to the expansion of the universe, we receive it at a longer wavelength. The detected wavelength 位_obs is related to the rest wavelength 位_rest by the redshift z: 位_obs = 位_rest * (1 + z).

But wait, the thing is, if the cloud is at a certain redshift, the absorption line would be at 1216*(1+z). But for ground-based optical telescopes to detect this, the observed wavelength must be within the optical range (like up to about 7000 Angstroms or 700 nm). Because if it's longer than that, it's into the infrared, which optical telescopes can't see as effectively. Or wait, do they have some capability? Maybe ground-based telescopes can't observe infrared effectively because the atmosphere is opaque at those wavelengths. So the cutoff is probably around 700 nm (or 7000 Angstroms).

Wait, but
