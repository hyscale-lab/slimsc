Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, specifically dealing with a rhombohedral crystal. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question gives me a rhombohedral crystal with an interatomic distance of 10 Angstroms. All the angles α, β, γ are 30 degrees. I need to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. The options are A to D, so I'll have to calculate and see which one matches.

Wait, first, what's a rhombohedral crystal? I remember that a rhombohedron is a type of crystal structure where all the edges are of equal length, but the angles between them are not 90 degrees. So it's a special case of the hexagonal crystal system, but I might be mixing that up. Alternatively, maybe it's part of the cubic system but with all angles equal but not 90. Hmm, I think rhombohedral is a subclass of the cubic system where a = b = c, and α = β = γ. So in this case, all edges are the same length, and all angles are the same, 30 degrees each. Oh wait, but that's a rhombohedral structure—so a is the lattice parameter.

Wait, but the interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstrom. In a rhombohedral system, the interatomic distance might be the same as the lattice parameter 'a' because it's a primitive lattice, right? Or wait, maybe not. Wait, in a cubic system, the interatomic distance for the (111) plane is a√3, but that's for a cubic system with 90-degree angles.

Wait, no—wait, interatomic distance is the distance between two adjacent atoms in the lattice. For a simple cubic structure, that's just the lattice parameter 'a'. But in a rhombohedral structure, the interatomic distance might be the same as 'a'. But wait, the interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstroms. So perhaps 'a' is 10 Angstroms in this case.

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps the interatomic distance refers to the distance between neighboring atoms along the edges. So the edge length 'a' is 10 Angstroms. Because in a simple cubic structure, that's the case.

But in any case, the problem is about calculating the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. The interplanar distance formula for a crystal is given by the Bragg's law formula, which is d = a / sqrt(h² + k² + l² + ... something involving the angles?), but wait, no. The general formula for interplanar distance in a crystal with lattice parameters a, b, c, and angles α, β, γ is a bit more complex.

Wait, the formula I think I remember is d_{hkl} = 1 / sqrt( (h²)/(a²) + (k²)/(b²) + (l²)/(c²) + ... some terms involving the cosines of the angles between axes) ). Wait, but in a cubic system where a = b = c, and angles are 90 degrees, the formula simplifies. But in this case, it's a rhombohedral system, so a = b = c, but angles α=β=γ=30 degrees.

Wait, the interplanar distance formula for a rhombohedral system. Let me think. I remember that for a rhombohedral crystal system, the interplanar spacing can be calculated using the formula:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² - 2hk cos α - 2hl cos β - 2kl cos γ )

Wait, but since all angles are equal and a = b = c, perhaps that can be simplified. Let me check that.

Alternatively, another formula I've seen is d = (a^2) / ( √( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2(hk cos α + hl cos β + kl cos γ) )) )

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let's try to get the correct formula.

The general formula for the interplanar distance in a crystal with lattice parameters (a, b, c), angles α, β, γ, and Miller indices (hkl) is given by:

1/d² = (h²/a²)(1/sin² α) + (k²/b²)(1/sin² β) + (l²/c²)(1/sin² γ) - 2hk/(a b sin α sin β) cos γ + ... Wait, no, perhaps I'm mixing up the terms.

Wait, I think the correct formula is:

d_{hkl} = 1 / sqrt( (h²)/(a²) + (k²)/(b²) + (l²)/(c²) + ... some terms involving cosines )

But in the case of a cubic system (a = b = c) with angles all 90 degrees, the formula simplifies to d = a / sqrt(h² +k² + l²).

But in our case, it's a rhombohedral system, where a = b = c = a (let's say a =10 Angstroms), and all angles are 30 degrees. So α = β = γ =30 degrees.

The formula for d_{hkl} in a rhombohedral system can be simplified. Let me think.

I found a formula online before (but I'm recalling it) that for a rhombohedral system, the interplanar spacing is given by:

d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ )

Wait, wait, that might be when the angles are all equal to θ. Because in a rhombohedral system, all angles are equal, so θ = α = β = γ.

So for this case, the formula becomes:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ )

Wait, but wait, I think I might have gotten the sign wrong. Because when the angles are less than 90 degrees, the term would affect the denominator. Let me think: for the cubic case, cos90=0, so the formula reduces to d = a / sqrt(h² +k² + l²), which is correct.

So for our case, θ=30 degrees, cosθ=√3/2 ≈ 0.866.

The (111) plane has h=1, k=1, l=1. So plugging in:

d = a / sqrt(1 + 1 + 1 + 2*(1*1 +1*1 +1*1)*cos30° )

Compute the denominator first.

So 1+1+1=3.

Then 2*(1*1 +1*1 +1*1) = 2*(3) =6.

Multiply by cos30°: 6 * (√3/2) = 3√3 ≈ 5.196.

So denominator inside sqrt is 3 + 5.196 ≈ 8.196.

So sqrt(8.196) ≈ 2.863.

So d = a / 2.863.

a is given as 10 Angstroms, so d ≈ 10 / 2.863 ≈ 3.492 Angstroms? Wait, that can't be right because the options are all around 9 Angstroms. Oh wait wait wait wait! Wait, no. Wait, the interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms. Wait, no, no, wait: in the rhombohedral structure, 'a' is the lattice parameter, which is the edge length. But the interatomic distance in the crystal (for example, in a simple cubic structure, it's the same as 'a').

Wait, but no, wait, maybe in a rhombohedral structure, the interatomic distance is the same as 'a' if it's a simple structure. So if the interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms, then a=10 Angstroms.

Wait, but then according to the calculation I did, d would be about 3.49 Angstroms, which isn't matching any of the options. So I must have made a mistake in the formula.

Hmm, perhaps I used the wrong formula. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula for a rhombohedral (or any triclinic system) is:

d^2 = a² (h² + k² + l² - 2 hk cos α - 2 hl cosβ - 2 kl cosγ) / ( (h² +k² + l²) + ... something ) )

Wait, no, perhaps I need to think more clearly. Another approach is to use the general formula for the interplanar distance in a crystal.

In general, for a crystal with lattice vectors a, b, c (with angles α, β, γ between them), the interplanar distance for plane (hkl) is given by:

d_{hkl} = 1 / sqrt( (h²/l²) + (k²/m²) + (l²/n²) - 2hk cos α / (l m) - 2hl cos β / (l n) - 2 kl cos γ / (m n) ) )

Wait, no, I think I'm mixing up the terms. Another approach: perhaps to use the general formula for interplanar spacing, which is:

d = \frac{1}{\sqrt{ (h^2/a^2 + k^2/b^2 + l^2/c^2) + (hk (cos β - cos α γ)/(a b sin γ)) + (hl (cos α - cos β γ)/(a c sin β)) + (kl (cos β - cos α γ)/(b c sin α)) ) } }

Wait, this seems complicated, especially with all the angles involved. But in the case where a = b = c, and all angles α=β=γ=θ, perhaps this can be simplified.

Wait, perhaps another approach. The volume of the unit cell in a rhombohedral system is V = a^3 * sqrt(1 - 3 cosθ² + 2 cos^3θ ), but I don't know if that helps.

Alternatively, using the formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral lattice: d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ )

Wait, but in this formula, if the angles are all 30 degrees, then cosθ = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866.

Wait, let's compute the denominator:

h = 1, k=1, l=1. So h² +k² +l² = 3.

hk =1, hl=1, kl=1.

So 2*(hk + hl + kl) = 2*(3) =6.

Multiply by cosθ: 6 * 0.866 ≈5.196.

So denominator inside sqrt is 3 +5.196 = 8.196.

sqrt(8.196) ≈ 2.863.

So d = a / 2.863.

If a =10 Angstroms, d ≈ 10 /2.863 ≈ 3.49 Angstroms. But none of the options are near 3.5, so that's a problem.

Wait, this suggests I'm using the wrong formula. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula d = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ ), but since the angles are 30°, which is acute, and thus cosθ is positive, so perhaps I have a sign error in the formula.

Wait, let's think about the structure of the formula. For a simple cubic structure with angles 90°, the formula is d = a / sqrt(h² +k² + l²). So if I have a rhombohedral structure with angles less than 90°, the interplanar distance would be smaller because the terms involving cosθ would subtract. Wait no, because cosθ is positive, so the denominator would be larger and d smaller.

Wait, but if the angles are 30°, maybe the formula is different. Let me try to find the correct formula for a rhombohedral system.

After some thinking, maybe the correct formula for a rhombohedral lattice is:

d_{hkl} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{ h² + k² + l² + 2(hk + hl + kl) \cos θ } }

But that can't be right because for the cubic case (θ=90°, cosθ=0), we get d = a / sqrt(h² +k² +l²), which is correct. But when θ is 30°, the denominator increases, making d smaller. But earlier I had a value of about 3.49 Angstroms, which isn't matching the options. So perhaps I'm applying the formula correctly, but the given interatomic distance isn't 'a', but perhaps a different value.

Wait, the problem states that the interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms. So perhaps 'a' isn't 10 Angstroms. In a simple cubic structure, the interatomic distance is 'a', so if in this case 'a' is something else, but the interatomic distance is given as 10, then perhaps I need to compute 'a' based on that.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the interatomic distance. In a simple cubic lattice, the interatomic distance is indeed 'a'. But in a rhombohedral system, perhaps the interatomic distance is along a different direction, like the diagonals.

Alternatively, perhaps the interatomic distance refers to the distance between two nearest neighboring atoms, which in a rhombohedral structure would be along the edges. So perhaps 'a' is the interatomic distance, so a=10 Angstroms.

But if that leads to a d of approximately 3.49 Angstroms, which doesn't match any of the options, then I must have made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps I should look for another approach. Maybe using the reciprocal lattice.

The interplanar distance is given by d = 1/|n|, where n is the reciprocal lattice vector. The reciprocal lattice vectors are given by:

n_h = h a* e1 + k b* e2 + l c* e3

But this might get complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the volume of the unit cell and then use the formula for d.

Wait, another approach is to compute the volume V of the rhombohedral unit cell, which is V = a^3 * sqrt(1 - 3 cos^2θ + 2 cos^3θ ), where θ is the angle between the edges (30 degrees here).

So V = a^3 * sqrt(1 - 3*(sqrt(3)/2)^2 + 2*(sqrt(3)/2)^3 )

Compute each term:

cosθ = cos30 = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660.

So:

3 (cosθ)^2 = 3 * (3/4) )=9/4 = 2.25.

2 (cosθ)^3 = 2*( (sqrt(3)/2)^3 ) = 2*( (3*sqrt(3))/8 ) )= (6 sqrt(3))/8 ) = (3 sqrt(3))/4 ≈ 1.299.

So,

1 - 2.25 + 1.299 ≈ 1 -2.25 is -1.25 +1.299 ≈ 0.049.

So V = a^3 * sqrt(0.049) ≈ a^3 * 0.2214.

But I'm not sure how this helps me. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the relation between d and a for the (111) plane.

Wait, another thought: maybe the formula I'm using is incorrect, and the correct formula for rhombohedral systems is slightly different. Let me try to look up the correct formula.

Upon recalling, I think the correct formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is:

d_{hkl} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{h² + k² + l² + 2(hk + hl + kl)\cos\alpha } }

Which is what I used earlier. Let me plug in the numbers again.

a=10, h=1, k=1, l=1, alpha=30 degrees.

So denominator inside sqrt:

h² +k² +l² = 3.

2(hk + hl + kl) = 2*(3) =6.

6 * cos(30) =6*(sqrt(3)/2) ≈6 * 0.8660 ≈5.196.

So total inside sqrt is 3 +5.196=8.196.

sqrt(8.196) ≈2.863.

So d=10 / 2.863 ≈3.49 Angstroms.

But the options are all around 9 Angstroms. So I must have made a mistake in assuming a=10.

Wait, perhaps the interatomic distance is not 'a', but something else. Like, perhaps the interatomic distance is not along the edges, but along the face diagonals or something else.

Wait, if the structure is simple, then in a cubic system, the interatomic distance is 'a' along the cube edges. But in a rhombohedral system, perhaps the nearest neighbor distance is along a different direction.

Wait, perhaps in a rhombohedral structure, the nearest neighbor distance is along the edge, so 'a' is the interatomic distance. So if a=10, then the calculation leads to d=3.49, which isn't among the options.

Hmm, so perhaps I'm using the wrong formula. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the formula uses the reciprocal of the Miller indices. Wait, no, that's not correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula involves the dot product of the vectors.

Wait, the (111) plane in a rhombohedral system. The normal vector to the plane would be (1,1,1) in reciprocal space. But I'm not sure if that helps.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the reciprocal lattice. The interplanar distance in the direct lattice is d, and in the reciprocal lattice, it's 1/d. But I'm not sure.

Wait, let's think differently. The reciprocal lattice vectors are defined as:

b1 = (2π/a) (e_x - e_y cosγ/(1 - cosγ) ... )

Wait, perhaps this is getting too complicated. Let me try to find another approach.

Another formula I found is:

d^2 = (a^2) / ( (h² + k² + l²) + 2hk cosα + 2hl cosβ + 2kl cosγ )

In this case, α=β=γ=30°, so:

d^2 = a^2 / [ 3 + 2*(1*1 cos30 + 1*1 cos30 + 1*1 cos30) ]

= a^2 / [ 3 + 2*(3* (√3/2) ) ]

= a^2 / [3 + 3√3 ]

Because 3 cos30° = 3*(√3/2) ≈2.598.

So denominator is 3 + 3√3 ≈3 + 5.196≈8.196.

So d= a / sqrt(8.196) ≈ a /2.863.

If a=10, then d≈3.49.

Again, the same problem. So the options don't match. So perhaps I have a misunderstanding about the given interatomic distance.

Wait, the question says "interatomic distance of 10 Angstrom". So interatomic distance is the distance between two adjacent atoms in the lattice. In a simple cubic structure, this is 'a'. But in a rhombohedral structure, perhaps the interatomic distance is not along the edges. Because in a cubic structure, the nearest neighbors are along the edges. But in a rhombohedral structure, perhaps the nearest neighbors are along the face diagonals or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the interatomic distance is the same as the edge length 'a'. So if a=10, then we proceed as before.

But again, the calculation gives d=3.49, which is not an option. So I must have made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, maybe the formula is d = a / sqrt( h² +k² +l² - 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ )

Wait, let me try that. So for θ=30°, cosθ=√3/2 ≈0.866.

So the denominator inside sqrt is 3 - 2*(3)*0.866.

So 3 - 6*(0.866) = 3 -5.196= -2.196. That can't be, since the square root of a negative number isn't real. So that's impossible. So this formula must be incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps I have the formula wrong. Let me think of another approach.

Wait, perhaps using the formula from the book. I think the correct formula is:

d_{hkl} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{ (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2hk \cos α - 2hl \cos β - 2kl \cos γ } } * \frac{1}{a}

Wait, but that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

d = \frac{a}{\sqrt{ h² + k² + l² + 2 (hk \cos α + hl \cos β + kl \cos γ) } }

Wait, let me plug in the numbers with this formula.

h=k=l=1, α=β=γ=30°, a=10.

So denominator inside sqrt:

(1 +1 +1) + 2*(1*1*(0.866) + 1*1*(0.866) +1*1*(0.866)) )

=3 + 2*(3*0.866) =3 + 6*(0.866) =3 +5.196=8.196.

sqrt(8.196)=2.863.

So d=10 / 2.863≈3.49 Angstroms. Again, same result as before.

But the options are all about 9 Angstroms, which is about 3 times higher. So perhaps I'm missing a factor of 3 somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I should have a=10√3. Because if the interatomic distance is along the face diagonal, perhaps a is 10, and the edge length is 10/(sqrt(3)) or something like that.

Wait, maybe I should reverse the approach. Let's say the interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstrom. Let's find 'a' such that the interplanar distance comes out to one of the options.

Wait, for example, if the correct answer is option C) 9.54 Angstroms.

So let me set d=9.54, and see what 'a' would give that.

So,

d = a / sqrt(3 + 6 cos30 )

= a / sqrt(3 + 6*(0.866)).

= a / sqrt(3 +5.196)= a/sqrt(8.196)= a/2.863.

Set d=9.54:

a = 9.54 * 2.863 ≈ 27.33 Angstroms.

But the question states that the interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms. So unless a is 27, which is not the case, perhaps this approach isn't correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I swapped the formula. Maybe d = a * sqrt( ... ), not divided by.

Wait, no, the formula for d is a divided by the sqrt(...), not multiplied. So that can't be.

Hmm, perhaps I should consider that the given interatomic distance is along a different direction, perhaps the (111) direction in a face-centered cubic structure.

Wait, no, but we're dealing with a rhombohedral structure.

Another possibility: perhaps the formula I'm using is for interplanar spacing in hexagonal systems, and I'm applying it incorrectly to rhombohedral.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula for a rhombohedral system is:

d_{hkl} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{ h^2 + k^2 + l^2 + 2 (hk + hl + kl) \cos θ } }

But wait, if θ is the angle between the axes, which is 30 degrees.

So let me compute again with a=10.

Denominator: sqrt(3 + 6 * cos30) = sqrt(3 +5.196)=sqrt(8.196)=2.863.

d=10 / 2.863≈3.49.

But the options are all around 9, which is 3 times larger.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula, and it's actually the reciprocal.

Wait, perhaps I inverted the formula. Maybe it's d = a * sqrt( ... ), but that would give a larger value. Let me try:

d = a * sqrt(3 +6 cos30 ) =10 * sqrt(8.196)=10*2.863≈28.63 Angstroms. Not matching.

Alternatively, maybe the formula is d = a * sqrt( ... ) but the denominator is sqrt( ... ). No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the formula is actually d = a * sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos θ ), but that would give sqrt(3 -5.196)= sqrt(-2.196), which is invalid.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the given interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms, and I need to find 'a', the lattice parameter, such that the interplanar distance for (111) is one of the options.

Wait, let's say the correct d is option C, 9.54 Angstroms.

So,

d = a / sqrt(3 +6*(sqrt(3)/2) )

= a / sqrt(3 +5.196)=a/sqrt(8.196) ≈ a/2.863.

Set d=9.54:

a =9.54 * 2.863 ≈27.33 Angstrom.

But the interatomic distance is given as 10, so if a is 27, that can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps the given interatomic distance is not 'a' but another parameter. Wait, maybe the interatomic distance is along the (111) direction, which would be the diagonal.

Wait, in a cubic system, the distance along the (111) direction would be a*sqrt(3). So if that's 10, then a=10 / sqrt(3) ≈5.7735 Angstroms.

But in this case, it's a rhombohedral system, so the (111) direction would have a different length.

Wait, perhaps the interatomic distance is along (111), so the distance is given by sqrt( (a)^2 + (a)^2 + (a)^2 + 2a^2 (cosα + cosβ + cosγ) )

Wait, no, perhaps the distance between two atoms in the (111) direction is given by the vector sum:

r = a (e1 + e2 + e3 )

The magnitude of r is sqrt( a² (1+1+1 + 2 cosα + 2 cosβ + 2 cosγ) )

Since α=β=γ=30°, this becomes:

r = a * sqrt(3 + 6 cos30) = a * sqrt(3 +6*(√3/2) ) = a * sqrt(3 + 3√3 ) ≈ a * sqrt(3 +5.196)=a*sqrt(8.196)=a*2.863.

If the interatomic distance along (111) is 10 Angstroms, then:

10 = a *2.863 → a=10/2.863≈3.49 Angstroms.

Then, the interplanar distance d for (111) would be a / sqrt(3 +6 cos30 ), which is:

d=3.49 / sqrt(8.196)=3.49 /2.863≈1.219 Angstroms. Which is even smaller, and not matching the options.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Perhaps I should try another approach.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the correct formula is d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( h² +k² +l² )

But that's only for a cubic system with angles 90 degrees.

In that case, for (111), d= a / sqrt(3).

If a=10, then d=10 /1.732≈5.773 Angstroms. Still not matching the options.

But the options are all around 9. So perhaps I have a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

d = (a) / ( sqrt( h² + k² + l² - 2hk cosα - 2hl cosβ - 2kl cosγ ) )

In this case, plugging in:

Denominator = sqrt(3 -6*(0.866)) = sqrt(3 -5.196)=sqrt(-2.196).

Which is impossible, so that can't be right.

Hmm, maybe I should think that the given interatomic distance is not along the edges but along another direction. For instance, if the interatomic distance is the distance between two (111) planes, but that doesn't make much sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the given interatomic distance is the same as the interplanar distance for another plane, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I should instead compute the volume of the unit cell and see if that helps. For a rhombohedral system, volume V = a^3 * sqrt( 1 -3 cos^2θ + 2 cos^3θ )

With θ=30°, so:

V = a³ * sqrt( 1 -3*(3/4) + 2*(3√3/8) )

Compute each term:

1=1.

3*(3/4)=9/4=2.25.

2*(3√3/8)= (6√3)/8= (3√3)/4≈1.299.

So,

1 -2.25 = -1.25.

-1.25 +1.299≈0.049.

So,

V =a^3 * sqrt(0.049) ≈ a^3 * 0.2214.

But I'm not sure how this relates to the interplanar distance.

Alternatively, perhaps the number I'm getting for d is correct, but it's not what the question is asking. Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the interplanar spacing, which is the same as d, but the options are in a different unit or I'm missing a factor.

Alternatively, perhaps the given interatomic distance is along the (100) direction, which would be 'a' itself. Then, if a=10, then d for (111) is about 3.49, which doesn't match any options.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula I'm using is wrong, and the correct formula is different.

Wait, perhaps I should refer to the general formula for interplanar distance in a crystal:

d_{hkl} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{ \left( \frac{h}{a} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{k}{b} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{l}{c} \right)^2 + \text{terms involving cosines of angles} } }

But in the case of a rhombohedral system, a=b=c, and the angles are all 30 degrees.

Wait, perhaps the formula becomes:

d_{hkl} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{ \frac{h^2 +k^2 +l^2}{a^2} + 2\frac{hk \cos \alpha + hl \cos \beta + kl \cos \gamma}{a^2} } }

Wait, is that correct? Because in a general system, there are cross terms involving the cosines of the angles between the axes.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

d^2 = (1/a²) [ h² +k² + l² + 2 hk cos α + 2 hl cos β + 2 kl cos γ ]

So,

d = a / sqrt( h² +k² +l² + 2 hk cos α + 2 hl cos β + 2 kl cos γ )

In our case, h=k=l=1, and α=β=γ=30°, so cos terms are all √3/2.

So,

Denominator inside sqrt:

1 +1 +1 =3.

2*(1*1 *√3/2 ) *3 (since there are three terms: hk, hl, kl) → 2*(√3/2)*3 → 3√3≈5.196.

So total inside sqrt is 3 +5.196=8.196.

d = a / sqrt(8.196) ≈ a/2.863.

If a=10, then d≈3.49 Angstroms.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps the given interatomic distance is not a but something else.

Wait, perhaps the given interatomic distance is the distance between (111) planes, which would be d. But that seems unlikely because the question states it's the interatomic distance.

Alternatively, perhaps the interatomic distance is the distance between neighboring atoms along a different direction, not along the lattice parameter a.

Wait, perhaps the interatomic distance is along the (200) direction. Let's say the distance is 10.

In that case, the distance would be a. So a=10.

But then, the (111) plane's d would be 3.49, which doesn't fit.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Let me look for another approach.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the correct formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system.

From a quick search in my memory, the formula is:

d_{hkl} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{ h² +k² +l² + 2(hk + hl + kl) \cos \theta } }

Which is what I used before.

So plugging in h=k=l=1, θ=30°, a=10:

d=10 / sqrt(3 +6*(√3/2) )=10/sqrt(3+5.196)=10/sqrt(8.196)=10/2.863≈3.49.

But the options don't have this.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option A:9.08, which would be 3.49 * 2.6, but I don't know why that would be.

Alternatively, perhaps I have the formula wrong, and the correct denominator is (h² +k² +l² - 2(hk+hl+kl) cosθ ).

Wait, but that gives a negative inside the sqrt, which is impossible.

Hmm. Maybe I should think that the given interatomic distance is along the (111) vector, so a*sqrt(3 + 6 cos30°) =10.

So,

a = 10 / sqrt(3 +6*(√3/2 )) =10/sqrt(3+5.196)=10/sqrt(8.196)=10/2.863≈3.49 Angstroms.

Then, the interplanar distance for (111) would be a / sqrt(3 +6 cos30 )=3.49/2.863≈1.219 Angstroms. Not matching options.

Hmm. I'm really stuck here. Maybe I should try to compute the reciprocal of the interplanar distance formula.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the given interatomic distance is the distance between two (111) planes, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, perhaps I should think that the interatomic distance is the same as the edge length, a=10, and then compute the (111) d-spacing. But that leads to 3.49, not matching the options.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that in a rhombohedral system, the interplanar distance formula is different. Let me try to find a different way. Maybe using the relation between interplanar distance and the unit cell.

Wait, perhaps using the formula from the Bravais lattice. For a rhombohedral lattice, the unit cell volume is V = a^3 / ( sqrt(1 + 2 cos α + 2 cos β + 2 cos γ + ... ) ), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the reciprocal of the d-spacing.

Wait, let me try to compute d=10 Angstroms, which is the given interatomic distance. Wait, but that's the interatomic distance, not the interplanar.

Wait, perhaps I should think that the interplanar distance is the same as the interatomic distance, but that's not correct because the interplanar distance is the distance between planes, while interatomic is the distance between atoms.

Hmm. I'm really stuck, but given the time I've spent, perhaps I should choose the closest option. Based on my calculation, d=3.49 isn't among the options, so I must have made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos θ )

Wait, let's try that.

Denominator inside sqrt: 3 - 6*(0.866) =3 -5.196= -2.196. That's negative, which is impossible. So that can't be.

Another thought: perhaps the formula is d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ )

Which is what I did earlier, leading to d=3.49.

But since none of the options match, perhaps I'm missing a factor of 3 somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is d = a * sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ )

Which would give d=10 * sqrt(8.196)=10*2.863≈28.63, which is even higher.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the formula is d = (a^2) / [ (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk cos α + hl cos β + kl cos γ) ]

So for our case, a=10, so a^2=100.

Denominator:3 + 6*(0.866)=8.196.

So d = 100 / 8.196≈12.20 Angstroms. Not matching options.

Wait, but the options are about 9, so perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps I should use the formula d = a / [ sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2 (hk + hl + kl) cosθ ) ]

But with θ=30°, that gives 3 -6*(0.866)=3-5.196=-2.196, which is negative. Not possible.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula uses cos(180-θ) instead of cosθ. Because in some formulas, the angles are defined as the angles in the unit cell, which might be the supplement.

So if θ=30°, then 180-30=150°, cos150= -√3/2≈-0.866.

So let's try that.

Denominator:

3 + 6*(-0.866)=3 -5.196= -2.196. Still negative, impossible.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should switch the sign in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

d^2 = (a²)/( (h² +k² +l²) - 2(hk cos α + hl cos β + kl cos γ) )

So,

d^2 = 100 / (3 -6*(0.866))=100/(3-5.196)=100/(-2.196)=negative. Not possible.

So, this can't be right.

At this point, I'm really stuck. Perhaps I should check the options and see which one fits a plausible calculation.

The options are:

A)9.08

B)8.95

C)9.54

D)10.05

If I consider that perhaps the formula is d= a * sqrt(1/(h² +k² +l² - 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ )) )

Wait, that would give d=10 * sqrt(1/(3 -5.196))=10*sqrt(1/-2.196) → invalid.

No, that doesn't work.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is d= a * sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ )

So,

d=10 * sqrt(8.196)=10*2.863≈28.63. Not matching.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the formula. Let me think differently. Maybe the interplanar distance is given by the reciprocal of the reciprocal lattice vector.

The reciprocal lattice vector for (hkl) is given by:

n = (h a* +k b* + l c* )

In a cubic system with a=b=c and angles 90°, this simplifies to:

n = (h, k, l) * (2π/a)

So the magnitude of n is 2π d, where d is the interplanar spacing.

So |n|=2π/d = sqrt( h² +k² + l² ) * (2π/a )

So,

d= a/( sqrt( h² +k² +l² ) )

But this is for a cubic system with 90-degree angles. Not applicable here.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps for a rhombohedral system, the reciprocal lattice vectors are more complex. But I don't remember the exact formula.

Another approach: perhaps I should use the general formula for interplanar distance:

d = \frac{1}{\sqrt{ (h^2/a^2) + (k^2/b^2) + (l^2/c^2) + ... terms involving cosines ... } }

But in the case of a rhombohedral system, a=b=c, and angles are all 30°, so perhaps the formula can be written as:

d = \frac{1}{\sqrt{ (h² +k² +l²)/a² + 2(hk cos α + hl cos β + kl cos γ)/a² } }

Which simplifies to:

d = a / sqrt( h² +k² +l² + 2(hk cos α + hl cos β + kl cos γ) )

Which is the same formula I used earlier. So this brings me back to the same calculation.

So with a=10, d≈3.49, which isn't an option.

Hmm. Maybe the given interatomic distance is not a, but something else. Perhaps the given interatomic distance is d for another plane. For example, perhaps d(100) is 10 Angstroms. Then, what would that imply?

For (100), h=1, k=0, l=0.

Using the formula,

d(100) = a / sqrt(1 + 0 +0 + 2(0 +0 +0) )=a/1= a.

So if d(100)=10, then a=10. Then, d(111)=10/sqrt(8.196)=≈3.49.

But again, this doesn't match the options.

Wait, maybe the given interatomic distance is along the (200) direction. For (200), h=2, k=0, l=0.

Then,

d= a/2.

If the interatomic distance is 10, then a/2=10 → a=20.

Then, d(111)=20/sqrt(8.196)=20/2.863≈6.99 Angstroms. Still not matching options.

Hmm.

At this point, I think the correct calculation leads to d≈3.49, but since none of the options match, perhaps I'm using the wrong formula. Alternatively, the question might have a typo, or I'm missing something in the setup.

Wait, perhaps the interatomic distance is given along the (111) direction. So the distance between two (111) planes would be d, and the interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms, which is the same as the interplanar distance. But that would imply that the planes are very close, which is unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the given interatomic distance is the same as the interplanar distance for (100), which is a=10. Then, for (111), d=3.49, which again doesn't match.

I think I've exhausted all possible approaches, and the only conclusion is that the correct answer based on the formula is approximately 3.49 Angstroms, but this isn't an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula or the approach.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that in a rhombohedral system, the interplanar distance formula is different. Let me think of another way. Maybe the correct formula is d = a * sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) ) / (some function of the angles).

Wait, another approach is to compute the reciprocal lattice parameter. Let me think: the reciprocal lattice vector for (111) is (1,1,1), so its magnitude is sqrt(1^2 +1^2 +1^2 + 2*(1*1 cos α +1*1 cos β +1*1 cos γ)).

Wait, no, perhaps the reciprocal lattice vector magnitude is given by:

|n| = sqrt( (h/a sin α')^2 + ... ), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for the reciprocal lattice vector's magnitude is:

|n| = sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2(hk cos α + hl cos β + kl cos γ) )

So,

|n|=sqrt(3 +6*(√3/2) )=sqrt(8.196)=2.863.

Then, the interplanar distance d is 1/|n|, but scaled by a factor of 2π/a?

Wait, I'm getting more confused now.

Perhaps I should give up and choose the closest option, but I can't see how any of them fit. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C)9.54 Angstroms.

Wait, 9.54 is approximately 10 / (something like 1.048). Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is d = a / sqrt( h² +k² +l² - 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ ), but that would require negative terms.

Wait, if I proceed with the formula d = a / sqrt(3 - 2*(3) *0.866 ), which is sqrt(3-5.196)=sqrt(-2.196), which is not possible. So that can't be.

Hmm.

Perhaps the correct answer is option C)9.54 Angstroms. I'm not sure, but I'll go with that.


To determine the interplanar distance \( d_{111} \) for a rhombohedral crystal with an interatomic distance of 10 Å and angles \(\alpha = \beta = \gamma = 30^\circ\), the formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is used:

\[
d_{hkl} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{h^2 + k^2 + l^2 + 2(hk + hl + kl) \cos\theta}}
\]

Here:
- \( a = 10 \, \text{Å} \) (interatomic distance),
- \( h = k = l = 1 \) (Miller indices for the (111) plane),
- \(\theta = 30^\circ\), so \(\cos 30^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \approx 0.866\).

### Step 1: Compute the denominator
The denominator inside the square root is:
\[
h^2 + k^2 + l^2 + 2(hk + hl + kl) \cos\theta
\]
Substituting the values:
\[
1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 + 2(1 \cdot 1 + 1 \cdot 1 + 1 \cdot 1) \cdot 0.866
\]
\[
= 3 + 2(3) \cdot 0.866 = 3 + 5.196 = 8.196
\]

### Step 2: Compute \( d_{111} \)
\[
d_{111} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{8.196}}
\]
\[
d_{111} = \frac{10}{\sqrt{8.196}} \approx \frac{10}{2.863} \approx 3.49 \, \text{Å}
\]

### Step 3: Compare with the options
The calculated value of \( d_{111} \approx 3.49 \, \text{Å} \) does not match any of the provided options, which are all around 9 Å. This discrepancy suggests either a misunderstanding of the given interatomic distance or a potential issue with the formula's application. 

Given the mismatch, the closest plausible option based on the problem setup is **C) 9.54 Å**, though the reasoning for this value is unclear.
