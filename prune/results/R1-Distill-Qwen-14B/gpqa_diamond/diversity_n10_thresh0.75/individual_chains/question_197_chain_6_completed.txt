Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let's take it step by step. The question is about identifying a compound based on its IR and NMR data, and then determining the product after a reaction with red phosphorus and HI.

First, I need to figure out what Compound X is. Let's look at the spectral data provided.

Starting with the IR data: The peaks are at 3400–2500 cm-1, which suggests either an O-H stretch (like in a carboxylic acid or alcohol) or maybe an N-H stretch. But since there's a peak at 1720 cm-1, that's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Carboxylic acids have O-H stretches around 2500-3300 cm-1, and their carbonyls are around 1700 cm-1. So maybe a carboxylic acid is present here. Alternatively, it could be an ester, but 1720 is a bit high for a ketone? Or maybe an aldehyde, but aldehydes have lower peaks. Hmm.

Wait, looking again, 1720 is more indicative of a carboxylic acid. Because esters are around 1730-1750 cm-1, but acids are lower, maybe around 1700. But 1720 might also fit an acid if it's deprotonated or in a different environment. Alternatively, could it be a ketone? No, because the 1720 is higher than typical ketones, which are around 1680-1780? Wait, no, ketones are usually around 1715 cm-1. Hmm. So maybe it's an ester? Or a carboxylic acid. Let me think more.

Looking at the NMR data:

The 1H NMR shows:
- 10.5 ppm, broad singlet (1H). That's a strong indication of a carboxylic acid proton. Because in D2O, the O-H would exchange and not show up, but if it's a broad peak around 10, that's likely a COOH proton.

So that supports the idea that Compound X is a carboxylic acid.

But wait, let me check the other peaks.

At 8.0 ppm, a doublet (2H), and 7.2 ppm, another doublet (2H). That suggests a para-substituted aromatic ring. Because two doublets of 2H each would mean two sets of equivalent protons across the ring. So maybe it's a benzene ring with substituents in the para positions.

Looking at the other signals: 2.9 ppm (m, 1H). That's probably a CH group adjacent to something, maybe a CH2 or a carbonyl. Then, 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) and 1.4 ppm (d, 3H). Oh, wait, 1.4 ppm as a doublet (d) for 3H, that's likely a CH2CH3 group, like an ethyl group. But wait, 1.7 as m, 2H could be adjacent to a CH, perhaps part of a -CH2CH2- or similar.

Wait, let me draw this out. So, the aromatic ring has substituents at positions 4 and 1 maybe? Or 1 and 4? Wait, it's a para substitution.

The substituents would be a -COOH group and something else, perhaps. Wait, in the NMR, there's a 10.5 ppm peak, which is the carboxylic acid. So the benzene ring has a COOH group attached, and another substituent. Let's see.

The aromatic protons are 8.0 (d, 2H) and 7.2 (d, 2H). That's characteristic of a para-substituted benzene, where there are two substituents opposite each other. Wait, no. Wait, if the substituents are in the para positions, each substituent has two adjacent protons, but that would give a pattern of two doublets integrating to 2H each, which matches.

But wait, if it's para-substituted, like 4-substituted benzene, but maybe with two substituents. Wait, no, in para substitution, there are two substituents in opposite positions. But in the NMR, if the ring has a substituent in position 4 and another in position 1 (like ortho to each other?), no, that wouldn't make sense. Or perhaps only one substituent? Wait, no, because the substituent would cause the ring protons to split into two doublets.

Wait, maybe the ring is para-substituted with two identical substituents. But wait, no, if it's a single substituent, the ring would have two sets of equivalent protons. For example, a substituent in the para position would split the ring into two sets of equivalent protons. For example, if the substituent is at position 4, the protons at positions 2 and 6 would be equivalent, and those at 3 and 5 would be another set. Wait, I might be getting this wrong.

Alternatively, the ring has two substituents, each in the para positions relative to each other. For example, substituents at positions 1 and 3 would be meta, but 1 and 4 would be para. Wait, no, if a substituent is at position 1 and another at position 3, that's meta. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Let me try to think about the other signals. The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) is probably a -CH- group. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) is likely adjacent to that CH. The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) could be a methyl group attached to a CH2. Oh wait, maybe it's a -CH2CH(CH3)-something? Or perhaps a -CH(CH2CH3) group. Wait, maybe it's a branching.

Alternatively, let's think about the substituent attached to the benzene ring. If the benzene has a COOH group and another substituent, perhaps a branched chain.

Looking at the 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), that's a methyl group attached to a CH2. So maybe it's a -CH2-C(CH3) something. Or perhaps it's a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group. Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a branching.

Wait, the substituent could be a propyl group attached to the ring. Let me think: if the substituent is a propyl group, but the NMR shows a 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), which is a CH adjacent to something. Let's consider a structure like -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-.

Wait, maybe it's a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group attached to the ring. So the substituent would be something like a sec-butyl group? Because a sec-butyl is CH2CH(CH2CH3)-.

Wait, let's build the structure. The benzene ring has a COOH group at position 4 and a substituent at position 1, maybe. Or perhaps it's a benzene ring with a COOH group in one position and another substituent in the para position.

Let me try to reconstruct the possible structure. The benzene ring has a substituent at position 4 (the COOH group) and another substituent at position 1. The substituent at position 1 would be a group that's causing the other NMR signals.

Wait, but the substituent is attached to the ring and has a chain. So perhaps it's a propyl group or butyl group attached to the ring.

Let's look at the NMR again. The 2.9 ppm (m,1H) is a CH group, and the 1.7 ppm (m,2H) would be adjacent to that. So maybe it's like CH2-CH(CH2CH3). Wait, that would be a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group. But how does that attach to the ring? If the substituent is a propyl group, but arranged as CH2-CH(CH2CH3), that might not fit. Alternatively, perhaps it's a butyl group.

Wait, another possibility: the substituent is a sec-butyl group. So the structure would be benzene ring with a COOH group and a sec-butyl group attached. Or maybe the substituent is a propyl group with a branch.

Alternatively, the substituent could be a -CH2CH(CH2CH3) group. Let me think about the integration. The 1H NMR has 1.4 ppm (d,3H) which is a methyl group attached to a CH2. The 1.7 ppm (m,2H) would be the CH2 next to the CH, which is at 2.9 ppm. So the structure could be:

Ph-COOH (the COOH is attached to the ring) and another substituent, which is a chain like CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-. Wait, but how does that fit?

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a branching, like a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group. Wait, that would be a pentyl group? No, I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH3)CH2- group. Hmm, perhaps a butyl group.

Wait, the 1.4 ppm (d,3H) suggests a CH(CH2CH3) group. So, the NMR indicates that there's a methyl group (3H, d) at 1.4, which is adjacent to a CH (2.9 ppm, m, 1H), which is adjacent to another CH2 group (1.7 ppm, m, 2H). And the CH2 is connected to the benzene ring.

So putting it together, the substituent on the benzene is a CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group. Wait, that doesn't quite fit. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH2CH3)- group attached to the ring. No, perhaps it's a butyl group arranged as -CH2CH(CH2CH3)-, but that might not fit the NMR.

Wait, another approach: look at the options provided. The options are A, B, C, D. Let's see what each option is.

Option A: 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid. So, the structure is benzene ring with an ethyl group at position 4 and a propanoic acid group at position 2. Wait, but wait, in that structure, the propanoic acid would be at position 2 of the benzene ring, which is attached to a phenyl group. Hmm, but the NMR shows a COOH proton at 10.5, which would fit if it's a propanoic acid attached to the benzene.

Option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So, the benzene ring has a benzoic acid group (COOH) at position 4 and a sec-butyl group attached. So, the substituents are at positions 4 (COOH) and another position (sec-butyl).

But wait, looking at the NMR data, the aromatic protons are two doublets, which suggests a para substitution. So if the ring has substituents at positions 1 and 3, that's meta, but if substituents are at positions 1 and 4, that's also para. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused about the positions here.

Wait, for para substitution, substituents are at positions 1 and 4. So if one substituent is COOH at position 4, then the other substituent would be at position 1. But in that case, the ring would have two substituents, each in para positions relative to each other.

But looking at the NMR, the aromatic protons are 8.0 (d, 2H) and 7.2 (d, 2H). That would happen if there are two substituents in the para positions, each with two adjacent protons. Wait, perhaps the substituents are both in the para positions, but that would require four substituents, which isn't the case here.

Wait, no, if the benzene has two substituents in para positions (like at positions 1 and 4), but each substituent is in a different position. For example, substituent A at position 1 and substituent B at position 4. Then, the ring would have four different protons, but maybe they split into two sets of doublets.

Wait, maybe it's a disubstituted benzene with substituents in para positions, making the ring have equivalent protons in two sets of doublets.

So, let's imagine the benzene ring has a COOH group at position 4 and a substituent at position 1. The substituent at position 1 is perhaps a propyl group or butyl group with branching.

Looking at the NMR, the 2.9 ppm (m,1H) is a CH group, which is probably connected to another CH2 group (1.7 ppm, 2H) and a methyl group (1.4 ppm, 3H, d). So perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH3)CH2- group attached to the ring. Wait, but how does that add up?

Alternatively, the substituent could be a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group, making it a pentyl group? No, that might complicate things. Wait, perhaps it's a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2- group, but that doesn't quite fit.

Alternatively, let's think of the substituent as a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group attached to the ring. Wait, but if the substituent is a butyl group, it would have more protons.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH3)CH2- group, but that might not fit the NMR. Alternatively, it's a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group, connected via a single bond to the ring.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a propyl group with a branch, like a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- group attached to the ring. But that would have more protons than what's observed.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH3)- group, but that might not fit.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group. Wait, but that would be a pentyl group attached as a branch.

I'm getting stuck here. Let me look at the options again.

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So benzoic acid (COOH) at position 4 and a sec-butyl group attached at position 4? Wait, no, because 4-(sec-butyl) would mean the substituent is at position 4 along with the COOH, which would be impossible unless it's a substituent attached to the COOH group. Wait, no, wait, perhaps the COOH is at position 4, and the sec-butyl is at position 1.

Wait, the structure would be:

Phenyl group with COOH at position 4 and a sec-butyl group at position 1. So the substituents are in para positions.

So the structure would be:

Benzoic acid at position 4, and a sec-butyl group at position 1. Let's draw that.

The benzene ring has substituents at positions 1 and 4. So substituent 1 is a COOH group, and substituent 4 is a sec-butyl group? Or vice versa.

Wait, no, 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid would mean the COOH is at position 4, and the substituent (sec-butyl) is at position 4 as well? That can't be. So perhaps it's a benzoic acid with a substituent at the para position, which is a sec-butyl group.

So, the structure would be benzene ring with COOH at position 4 and a substituent at position 1, which is a sec-butyl group.

So, the substituent would be a sec-butyl group at position 1, which is the same as the COOH being at position 4.

So the NMR would show the aromatic protons as two doublets, each integrating to 2H. Because the substituents are para, the ring protons would be split into two sets.

The substituent at position 1 is a sec-butyl group. The structure of a sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH2CH3). So, the substituent is attached to the benzene as CH2CH(CH2CH3). Wait, but the substituent would be -CH2CH(CH2CH3)- attached to the ring?

Wait, no, a sec-butyl group is -CH(CH2CH3)CH2-. No, wait, the structure is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-, attached via the CH2 group. So, the substituent is CH2-CH(CH2CH3) attached to the ring.

But wait, the NMR data shows a signal at 2.9 ppm (m,1H), which would correspond to the CH in the middle of the substituent. Let me think:

The substituent is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- attached to the ring. So the CH (at 2.9 ppm) is connected to a CH2 (1.7 ppm, 2H) and a CH2CH3 (1.4 ppm, 3H, d). That makes sense. So the substituent would be -CH2CH(CH2CH3)-, attached to the benzene.

So, putting it all together, the structure of Compound X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. Which would correspond to option C.

Now, the reaction part: Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Red phosphorus and HI are typically used to eliminate a carboxylic acid to form an alkene (decarboxylation reaction). Alternatively, this is the Clemmensen reduction, but wait, Clemmensen uses HCl and HCl with Zn(Hg)/Hg. Wait, no, red phosphorus and HI is used for the reduction of esters or nitriles to alkanes, but in the case of carboxylic acids, perhaps it's a different reaction.

Wait, another thought: maybe it's the formation of an acyl chloride. But no, red phosphorus and HI is used in the presence of a carboxylic acid to form an acyl iodide. Wait, wait, the reaction of a carboxylic acid with PCl5, PCl3, or other phosphorus halides to form acyl chlorides. But red phosphorus and HI is perhaps a different condition.

Alternatively, I think that when a carboxylic acid reacts with HX (like HI) in the presence of red phosphorus, it undergoes a substitution reaction. For example, the acid group is converted into an iodide, but maybe in this case, it's more about the elimination.

Wait, wait, perhaps it's the Hell–Valliant reaction? Or maybe it's more about the formation of an acyl iodide. Let me think.

Wait, another angle: the structure of Compound X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. When this reacts with red phosphorus and HI, what happens?

I recall that when a carboxylic acid reacts with HI and red phosphorus, it's a way to form an acyl iodide. So the reaction could be:

RCOOH + HIO4 → RCOI + H2O

But wait, I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a benzylic acid elimination.

Wait, another possibility: the reaction is a decarboxylation. If the substituent on the benzene ring is a good leaving group or adjacent to a leaving group, perhaps elimination occurs.

Wait, 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid reacting with HI and red phosphorus. Hmm, I might be mixing reactions here. Let me think again.

Red phosphorus and HI: another reaction I remember is the reduction of ketones to alkanes, but that's the Clemmensen-like reduction. But in this case, the compound is a carboxylic acid.

Wait, perhaps the phosphorus acts as a reducing agent. The reaction conditions might lead to the conversion of the carboxylic acid into a hydrocarbon. But how?

Alternatively, maybe the carboxylic acid is converted into an acyl iodide, which then undergoes elimination to form an alkene. For example, the Hell–Valliant reaction forms alkenes from acyl chlorides via elimination. But in this case, it's an acyl iodide.

Wait, wait, another approach: looking at the options. The options after reaction are A, B, C, D.

Option A is 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid.

Option B is 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene.

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

Option D is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.

Wait, the reaction is with red phosphorus and HI. Red phosphorus is often used in the formation of acyl chlorides when reacted with acid chlorides, but with carboxylic acids, perhaps it's different.

Wait, another thought: when a carboxylic acid reacts with HI in presence of red phosphorus, it may form an alkyl iodide via elimination of CO2. For example, the acid group (COOH) could be replaced by I, but that's not straightforward.

Alternatively, considering that the starting material has a sec-butyl group attached to the benzene ring, and a COOH group as well.

Wait, but if the reaction is deprotonation and elimination, perhaps the COOH is converted into an iodide, but that's unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a Benzoin condensation? No, that's for aldehydes.

Wait, perhaps it's a substitution reaction where the COOH is replaced by an iodide. So, the product would be 4-(sec-butyl)benzene-iodide. But none of the options look like that.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a decarboxylation elimination. For example, if the carboxylic acid is in a position where elimination can occur, it could lose CO2 and form an alkene.

But for that, the substituent should be such that a double bond can form. Let me think: if the substituent is a sec-butyl group, which is a branching, perhaps the elimination would form an alkene adjacent to the benzene ring.

Wait, let's imagine the structure of 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid:

Ph–COOH (Ph is the benzene ring) and the substituent at position 4 is a sec-butyl group.

Wait, but wait, in our earlier analysis, the substituent was at position 1. No, the options say 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, so the substituent is at position 4 and the COOH is at the same position? No, that can't be. Wait, no, 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid would mean the substituent is a sec-butyl group attached to the benzene ring at position 4, and the COOH is at position 1 (since benzoic acid is at position 1 by default). So, the structure is COOH at position 1, and the substituent (sec-butyl) at position 4.

So, when this reacts with red phosphorus and HI, what happens?

Maybe the reaction is a substitution where the COOH group is replaced by an iodide. But how?

Alternatively, perhaps the COOH group is converted into an acyl iodide, which then undergoes elimination to form an alkene. Wait, the Hell–Valliant reaction forms alkenes from acyl chlorides. So, acyl iodides might undergo a similar reaction.

So, if the benzoic acid is converted to benzoyl iodide, then under suitable conditions, elimination could occur. But where would the elimination happen?

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a simple substitution, converting the -COOH into an -I group, but that would give 4-(sec-butyl)benzene iodide. But none of the options match that.

Looking at the options again:

Option D is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. Wait, that's a toluene derivative with substituents at positions 1 and 4. The substituents are a sec-butyl group and a methyl group. That doesn't seem to align with the reaction I was thinking.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a Benzene ring substitution. But the starting material already has substituents. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a reduction.

Wait, another approach: red phosphorus and HI are used in the reduction of esters or nitriles to alkanes. But in this case, the starting material is a carboxylic acid.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the reduction of the carboxylic acid. But carboxylic acids are generally not easily reduced. Wait, but red phosphorus and HI might be used in the presence of a Grignard reagent or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the COOH is converted to a CH2 group.

Wait, if the starting material is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid and it is reduced, perhaps the COOH becomes a CH2 group. So, the product would be 4-(sec-butyl)toluene. Wait, that would be 4-(sec-butyl)benzene with a methyl group (from the reduction of COOH to CH2).

Wait, that would make the structure benzene ring with a methyl group (from COOH) and a sec-butyl group at position 4. But wait, if the COOH is at position 1, then reducing it would give a methyl group at position 1, and the substituent at position 4 would be a sec-butyl group, making the structure 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene, which is option D.

Wait, option D is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. So, that would mean the benzene ring has a methyl group at position 4 and a sec-butyl group at position 1.

But wait, in the starting material, the COOH was at position 1, and the substituent (sec-butyl) was at position 4. So, when the COOH is reduced, it becomes a methyl group at position 1, and the substituent at position 4 is the sec-butyl group. So the product would be 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. Which is option D.

But how does the reduction work? Red phosphorus and HI are reducing agents. Maybe they're used to reduce the carboxylic acid group to a methyl group. So the reaction would be:

RCOOH → RCH2-

Wait, but in reality, reducing a carboxylic acid to an alkane usually requires more vigorous conditions, like using LiAlH4, but maybe in this case, with red phosphorus and HI, it's possible.

Wait, another thought: the reaction might be a substitution. The COOH group is replaced by an iodide, but that would produce a benzene ring with an iodide substituent, which isn't one of the options.

Alternatively, if the COOH is converted into an alkyne or alkene, but I don't think that's the case here.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about the reaction again. Red phosphorus and HI are used in the presence of a carboxylic acid to form an acyl iodide. So, the reaction would convert RCOOH into RCOI.

But then, what happens to the acyl iodide? Well, perhaps under certain conditions, it can undergo elimination to form an alkene. But in this case, the acyl iodide would be attached to the benzene ring. So, if the substituent is RCOI, how would elimination occur?

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a decarboxylation elimination. The acyl iodide could lose COI and form a double bond.

Wait, if the structure is RCOI attached to the benzene ring, where R is a sec-butyl group, then losing COI would form a double bond. But I'm not sure about the feasibility of that.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a coupling. But I'm not certain.

Wait, maybe I should think about what each option looks like after reaction.

Option D is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. So, the benzene ring has a methyl group at position 4 and a sec-butyl group at position 1. So, substituents at positions 1 and 4 (para).

But how would the starting material (4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid) become this after reaction with red phosphorus and HI?

If the COOH group is reduced to a methyl group, then yes, that would give the structure in option D. So, the reaction reduces the COOH to CH2, producing a methyl group.

Wait, but how? Red phosphorus and HI as a reducing agent? I'm not fully confident about that. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the COOH is replaced by CH2.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a Benzoin condensation, but that doesn't fit here.

Wait, another angle: the reaction could be the formation of an acyl chloride followed by elimination. Let me think.

If the COOH is converted to COCl (using PCl5, but in this case, it's red phosphorus and HI, which might not do that). Then, perhaps the COCl could undergo elimination to form an alkene.

But the options don't show any alkenes. Looking at the options: option B is 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene, which is a branched alkylbenzene. Option D is similar but with a sec-butyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a simple substitution where the COOH is replaced by an iodide, but again, none of the options match that.

Wait, another possibility: if the reaction is a Benzoin condensation, but I don't think that applies here.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the reduction of the carboxylic acid to an alcohol, but that would require different conditions.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution. But the starting material is a carboxylic acid, which is not very reactive towards SN2.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me approach this differently.

The starting material is a carboxylic acid (from NMR and IR data). The reaction conditions are red phosphorus and HI. So, what reaction typically occurs with red phosphorus and HI?

Red phosphorus and HI is used in the preparation of iodides from alcohols. For example, an alcohol (ROH) reacts with HI and red phosphorus to form RI and the corresponding alkane. But that's for alcohols.

In this case, the starting material isn't an alcohol but a carboxylic acid. Another possibility is that the carboxylic acid is converted into an acyl iodide. The reaction of a carboxylic acid with excess HI in the presence of red phosphorus can produce an acyl iodide.

So, RCOOH + HI → RCOI + H2O.

Once the acyl iodide is formed, what happens next? Well, under certain conditions, acyl iodides can undergo elimination to form alkenes. But in this structure, where would the elimination occur?

The structure is Ph-RCO-I. Wait, no, the acyl iodide would be attached to the benzene ring as RCO-I, where R is the substituent. So, the benzene ring has a COI group attached to the sec-butyl group.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. The starting material is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, which is benzene with a COOH group and a sec-butyl group in the para positions.

When it reacts with red phosphorus and HI, it forms the acyl iodide: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoyl iodide.

Then, perhaps the acyl iodide undergoes elimination. But where would the elimination occur? The acyl group is on the benzene ring; perhaps it's not possible to eliminate in this case.

Alternatively, perhaps the acyl iodide undergoes some kind of substitution reaction, but I'm not seeing it.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a reduction. Red phosphorus and HI can reduce certain functional groups. For example, in the presence of an acyl iodide, maybe the carbonyl group is reduced.

Wait, but reducing an acyl iodide would give an alkyl iodide. So, RCOI → RCH2I.

So, the benzoyl iodide would reduce to a benzyl iodide. But that would require the benzene ring to have a CH2I group.

Wait, the starting material is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So, if the COOH is converted to CH2I, the substituent would be a CH2I group at position 1, and the sec-butyl group at position 4.

But that's not one of the options. The options don't have an iodide group.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Let me think of the options again.

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, which is the starting material. So, the product can't be that.

Option D is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. That would be the product if the COOH is reduced to a methyl group.

But how does the reaction achieve that?

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a Benzoin condensation, but that's for aldehydes.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a Gattermann–Koch reaction, which adds a formyl group. But that doesn't fit here.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a simple substitution where the COOH is converted into a methyl group, but I'm not sure about the mechanism.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a hydrolysis, but that doesn't make sense with HI and red phosphorus.

Wait, maybe I should think about the product structure again. If the starting material is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, and the product is Option D: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene, that implies that the COOH group is replaced by a methyl group.

So, the reaction would be: RCOOH → RCH2.

But how?

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a reduction, converting the COOH group into a CH2 group.

Wait, if red phosphorus and HI are used as reducing agents, perhaps they reduce the COOH group to a CH3 group. So, the product would have a methyl group where the COOH was.

In that case, the structure would be a benzene ring with a methyl group at position 1 and a sec-butyl group at position 4, which is option D.

So, putting it all together, the product would be 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene, which is option D.


To determine the final product, we first analyze the spectral data to identify Compound X. The IR spectrum shows strong peaks at 3400–2500 cm⁻¹ (indicative of an O-H stretch, likely from a carboxylic acid) and 1720 cm⁻¹ (a carbonyl C=O stretch). The NMR data confirms the presence of a carboxylic acid proton at 10.5 ppm (broad singlet, 1H). The aromatic region (8.0 ppm, d, 2H and 7.2 ppm, d, 2H) suggests a para-substituted benzene ring. Additional signals at 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), and 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) indicate a branched alkyl chain, likely a sec-butyl group.

From this analysis, Compound X is identified as **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**, where the benzene ring has a carboxylic acid group at position 1 and a sec-butyl group at position 4 (para substitution).

Next, we consider the reaction with red phosphorus and HI. Red phosphorus and HI are known to reduce carboxylic acids to alkanes by replacing the -COOH group with a -CH3 group. Applying this to Compound X, the carboxylic acid group at position 1 is reduced to a methyl group, resulting in **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**. This structure matches Option D.

### Critical Analysis of Options:
- **Option A (2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid):** This structure does not match the starting material or the reaction conditions.
- **Option B (1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene):** This structure incorrectly identifies the substituent as an isobutyl group instead of a sec-butyl group.
- **Option C (4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid):** This is the starting material, not the product.
- **Option D (1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene):** This matches the expected product after reduction of the carboxylic acid to a methyl group.

The final product is **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.
