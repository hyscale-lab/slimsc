Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about molecular spectroscopy, specifically the quantum rotation-vibration model. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says that a diatomic molecule made of elements X and Y is in its fundamental state. We need to find the momentum of a photon that would cause it to switch to the next lowest energy state. The given data includes the masses of X and Y, the bond length, and the angular frequency of vibration.

Hmm, I remember that in the rotation-vibration model, the energy levels involve both rotational and vibrational contributions. The fundamental state is the lowest energy state, which is vibrationally the ground state (v=0) and rotationally the ground state (J=0). When a photon is absorbed, the molecule transitions to the next higher state. But wait, what's the next state in terms of energy? I think that the lowest energy transition would be either a vibrational or rotational change. The molecule can absorb a photon and go to a higher vibrational state (like v=1) or a higher rotational state (J=1), whichever requires less energy.

Wait, but the question says "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy." So I think it's the smallest energy increment. So maybe the energy difference between the fundamental state (v=0, J=0) and the next possible state is either a change in vibration or rotation.

Let me think about the energy levels. The rotational energy levels are quantized and given by E_rot = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant. The vibrational energy levels are E_vib = (1/2) h w + h w (v + 1/2), where w is the angular frequency. But wait, the fundamental state is the first vibrational state? No, wait. I think the ground state is v=0. The energy levels for vibration are E_vib = (v + 1/2) h w. So the first vibrational state is v=0, the next is v=1. The energy difference between v=0 and v=1 is h w.

For rotation, the ground state is J=0. The next state would be J=1. The energy difference for J=0 to J=1 is E_rot: from J=0, E = 0, to J=1, E = B * 2 (since J(J+1) for J=1 is 2). So the energy difference is
