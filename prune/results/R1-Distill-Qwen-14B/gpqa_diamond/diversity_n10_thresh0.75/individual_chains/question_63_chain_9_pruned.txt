Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a diatomic molecule and the quantum rotation-vibration model. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. 

The question says the molecule is in its fundamental state, and we need to find the momentum of a photon that would cause it to transition to the next lowest energy state. The options are A to D, all in terms of NÂ·s.

First, let me recall what the fundamental state means. I think in the context of rotation-vibration models, the fundamental state is the lowest energy state, which would be the ground state. So the next state with the lowest possible energy would be the first excited state. 

Wait, but what's the structure of the energy levels here? I remember that for diatomic molecules, the energy levels come from both rotation and vibration. The rigid rotor model deals with rotation, and the harmonic oscillator model deals with vibration. But since the question mentions the non-rigid rotor model, maybe it's considering both? Or perhaps it's the quantum rotation-vibration model, which combines both?

Wait, the question says it's modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, which I think is also known as the non-rigid rotor model. So this model includes both rotational and vibrational energy states.

But the molecule is in the fundamental state, which would be the ground state for both rotation and vibration. So the ground state would be the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0). 

Now, when a photon is absorbed, the molecule transitions to
