Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here. Hmm, let's see. The question is about a particle in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential. The potential is given by V(r) = 1/2 m ω² r². Wait, wait, no, actually, the way it's written, that's correct. Because for a harmonic oscillator, V(r) is like (1/2) m ω² r². So yeah, that's the potential.

The question is asking about the energy of the third excited state and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for that same energy. The options are A through D, each with different values for energy and the number of eigenfunctions.

Okay, let's break this down. First, I remember that in three dimensions, the harmonic oscillator is often treated as three separate one-dimensional oscillators along each axis, but since it's isotropic, the problem can be simplified using spherical coordinates. So, the energy levels are given by the sum of the quantum numbers in each direction.

Wait, no, actually, in three dimensions, the energy levels are determined by the principal quantum number n, which is related to the sum of the quantum numbers in each direction. Wait, for a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are quantized and given by E = (n + 3/2) ħω, where n is a non-negative integer (n=0,1,2,...). But wait, n is usually the sum of the quantum numbers nx, ny, nz. Because for each direction, the energy is (nx + 1/2) ħω, so when you add them, you get (nx + ny + nz + 3/2) ħω. So n = nx + ny + nz.

But in this case, the question is about the third excited state. Wait, I need to clarify what the "third excited state" refers to. In quantum mechanics, the ground state is the lowest energy state, which is n=0. The first excited state is n=1, the second is n=2, third is n=3. So the third excited state would be n=3.

Wait, no, sometimes people might count differently. Wait, ground state is n=0, first excited is n=1, second is n=2, third is n=3. So yeah, n=3 is the third excited state.

So the energy E would be (3 + 3/2) ħω
