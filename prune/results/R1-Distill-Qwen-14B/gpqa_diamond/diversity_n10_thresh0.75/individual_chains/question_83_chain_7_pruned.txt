Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to titration calculations, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

We're diluting 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate that solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given, and the Ka is 1.85x10^-5. Hmm.

Alright, let's break this down. First, when you dilute a solution, the concentration changes. So the initial step is to figure out the concentration after dilution.

The initial volume is 20 cm³, and the concentration is 0.05 M. Then we add 20 cm³ of water. So the total volume is 40 cm³. The number of moles of acetic acid (CH3COOH) initially is volume times concentration. So 0.02 L * 0.05 mol/L = 0.001 mol. After dilution, the concentration is moles over total volume, which is 0.001 mol / 0.04 L = 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Next, when titrating with NaOH, the reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COONa + H2O. So each mole of NaOH neutralizes a mole of acetic acid, producing the acetate ion (CH3COO^-).

We need to find pH at 25% titration and at equivalence point.

First, let's find the equivalence point. The moles of CH3COOH are 0.001 mol. Since NaOH is 0.1 M, the volume needed for equivalence is moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 cm³. So the equivalence point occurs when 10 cm³ of NaOH is added.

Wait, but the question is about 25% titration. So 25% of the equivalence volume. 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³. So at 2.5 cm³, we've added 0.025 L * 0.1 M = 0.0025 L *0.1 = 0.00025 mol of NaOH. Since the initial moles were 0.001, the moles reacted are 0.00025, so the remaining CH3COOH is 0.001 -0.00025= 0.00075 mol. And the moles of acetate (CH3COO^-) formed are 0.00025 mol.

Wait, but wait, the total volume after adding 2.5 cm³ of NaOH to the 40 cm³ solution. So the total volume is 42.5
