Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about titration, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The problem says we have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. We dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate this solution with 0.1 M NaOH. The question is asking for the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The given Ka of acetic acid is 1.85x10^-5. The options are A, B, C, D.

Hmm, okay. So first, I think I need to find out what's happening at the 25% titration point and then at the equivalence point. Let me break this down.

First, let's find out the initial concentration after dilution. Acetic acid is a weak acid, and we're diluting it. So when we mix 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40 cm³. The moles of acetic acid would be Molarity × Volume. So 0.05 M * 0.02 L (since 20 cm³ is 0.02 L) = 0.001 moles. Then, after dilution, the new volume is 0.04 L. So the new concentration is 0.001 moles / 0.04 L = 0.025 M. Wait, no, 0.001 / 0.04 is 0.025? Let's see: 0.001 ÷ 0.04 is 0.025 M, yes. So the diluted acetic acid solution is 0.025 M.

Wait, but wait, let me double-check. 20 cm³ is 0.02 L. 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 moles. Then when we add another 20 cm³ of water, the total volume is 40 cm³ or 0.04 L. So 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. That's correct.

Now, the titration is with 0.1 M NaOH. The equivalence point is when all the acetic acid has been neutralized. So I need to find how much NaOH is needed for that.

At equivalence, the moles of NaOH will equal the moles of acetic acid. Moles of acetic acid is 0.001 (from earlier). Since NaOH is 0.1 M, moles = Molarity × Volume. So 0.001 = 0.1 * Volume. Volume = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. So the equivalence point is when 10 cm³ of NaOH has been added.

Wait, but the question is about 25% titration. So 25% of the equivalence point. So 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. The total volume at equivalence is 40 cm³ (original solution) + 10 cm³ NaOH = 50 cm³. But when we talk about 25% titration, it refers to the amount of acid that has been neutralized. So 25% of the equivalence point is when 2.5 cm³ of NaOH has been added.

But perhaps I should approach this by considering the initial solution and then the moles at 25% titration.

So, first, the initial solution after dilution is 0.025 M acetic acid, and the volume is 40 cm³.

At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH. So the moles of acetic acid reacted would be 25% of 0.001 moles, which is 0.00025 moles.

Wait, but how does this work in solution? Let me think about the titration reaction. Acetic acid (CH3COOH) reacts with NaOH (OH-) to form acetate ion (CH3COO^-) and water.

So the reaction is: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O.

So initially, we have 0.001 moles of CH3COOH. At 25% titration, 0.25 × 0.001 = 0.00025 moles have reacted. So moles of CH3COOH left would be
