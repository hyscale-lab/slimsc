Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's start from the beginning.

The question is about a star with certain characteristics and how the presence of dark spots affects the ratio of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels. Hmm, I remember that when stars have spots, it can change their overall brightness and temperature. But how does that tie into the ratio of these energy levels?

Alright, let me break down the given information. The star's radius is 1.5 solar radii, and its mass is 1.1 solar masses. When there are no spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Interesting, so the presence of spots lowers the effective temperature.

The main part of the question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels. When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. So without spots, the ratio is higher than when there are spots. The question is asking for the factor by which this ratio changes.

Wait, the problem mentions that the transition between these levels corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 Å. I think this wavelength corresponds to the transition in Ti atoms, which would be in the optical or UV range. But how does the temperature affect the ratio of the populations in these energy levels?

I recall that in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the distribution of atoms in different energy levels is governed by the Boltzmann equation. The ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels is given by n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k*T) ), where g is the statistical weight, E is energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

Wait, but the problem says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when the spots are present, the effective temperature is lower (5500 K) compared to when there are no spots (6000 K). Let me think about how a lower temperature affects the ratio.

The ratio n2/n1 depends exponentially on -ΔE/(kT). So as T decreases, the exponential term becomes smaller because the denominator is smaller. For example, if the energy difference ΔE is positive (E2 > E1), then a lower T would make the exponent more negative, so the ratio n2/n1 decreases. Because when T is lower, higher energy levels are less populated relative to lower ones.

So, in this case, when the star has spots, T_eff is 5500 K, and without spots, it's 6000 K. So when T increases, the ratio n2/n1 increases because the exponent becomes less negative.

The problem says the ratio decreases when the star has spots, which aligns with this because the temperature is lower. So without spots, the ratio is higher.

Wait, but the question is about the factor by which the ratio changes. So what is the ratio when no spots (T=6000 K) divided by the ratio when spots are present (T=5500 K)?

Let me write down the formula.

n2/n1 = (g
