Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their photospheres, and it's about the excitation of iron atoms. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think.

The question says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh right, when they say "twice as excited," I think that refers to the population of a higher energy level compared to a lower one. So maybe the excitation here relates to the Boltzmann distribution of energy levels in a star's atmosphere.

Wait, the problem mentions that the stellar photospheres are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), which makes sense because that's a common assumption in stellar spectroscopy. So the excitation levels would follow the Boltzmann equation.

The Boltzmann equation relates the relative populations of two energy levels. The formula is n_i / n_j = (g_i/g_j) * exp( - (E_i - E_j)/(k T) ). Oh right, where n_i is the population of level i, g_i is the statistical weight, E is the energy, and k is Boltzmann's constant, T is temperature.

In this problem, the energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Let me just note that down: Î”E = 1.38e-23 J.

Now, for star_1, the excitation is twice that of star_2. Wait, the question says the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. So I
