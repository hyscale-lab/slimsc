Okay, so I've got this problem about the partition function for a system of three spins. Let me try to work through it step by step.

So, the setup is that we have three spins: S1, S2, and S3. Each can be either +1 or -1. The energy of the system is given by E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. I need to find the partition function Z.

Wait, the partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of exp(-βE), right? Because each state contributes a term proportional to e^(-βE) to Z.

But wait, in this case, each spin can be either +1 or -1. So how many possible states are there? Each spin has two possibilities, so the total number of states is 2^3 = 8. So I'll have to consider all 8 possible combinations.

Each state is a triplet (S1, S2, S3), where each S can be ±1. For each of these, I need to calculate E and then compute e^(-βE), then sum them all up.

Wait, alternatively, maybe I can find a smarter way than listing all 8 states. Let me think about the possible values of the energy E.

Looking at the energy expression: E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. Let me denote the sum inside as S = S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3. So E = -J * S.

So each term in the sum is S_i S_j, which is either +1 or -1, because each S is ±1. So each individual product S_i S_j can be +1 or -1. So the sum S is the sum of three terms each ±1
