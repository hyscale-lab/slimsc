Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with all the reactions, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem describes a series of reactions starting with Compound A (C3H6) and going through several steps to form Compounds B, C, D, E, F, G, and H. Then, there are four statements (Options A to D) about these products, and I need to find the incorrect one.

First, I'll try to figure out each transformation step by step.

Starting with Compound A: C3H6. The molecular formula is C3H6. Wait, what compounds have that formula? Well, possible structures are propene (propylene, CH2=CHCH3), propane, or cyclopropane. But since the next step is bromination in CCl4, which is probably a substitution reaction.

Wait, CCl4 is a solvent used in bromination via a radical mechanism, right? That typically happens with alkenes. So if A is C3H6 and it's undergoing bromination with CCl4, it's probably an addition or substitution on an alkene. Oh wait, bromination in CCl4 is usually for adding Br2 across double bonds, like an alkene undergoing bromination.

So if A is propene (C3H6), then bromination would add Br2 across the double bond. Propene has the structure CH2=CHCH3. When it reacts with Br2, it would form 1,2-dibromopropane, I think. Wait, no, more accurately, the bromine adds across the double bond, forming a dibromide. So the product B would be 1,2-dibromopropane (BrCH2CHBrCH3?), but wait, no, wait. Alternatively, perhaps it's 1,2-dibromopropane, but let me think again.

Wait, propene is CH2=CH2CH3. Adding Br2 would break the double bond and add Br atoms across it. So the product B would have two Br atoms on adjacent carbons. So for CH2=CHCH3, adding Br2 would give CH2BrCHBrCH3.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Propene is CH2=CH2CH3, so adding Br2 would
