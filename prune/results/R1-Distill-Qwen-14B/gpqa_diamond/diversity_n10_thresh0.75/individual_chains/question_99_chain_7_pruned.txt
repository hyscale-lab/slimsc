Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm going to try to figure it out step by step. Let's read through the question again carefully.

The question says that an unknown compound was prepared, and we're using FTIR and 1H NMR to identify it. The FTIR shows a very broad peak at 3000 cm^-1 and a strong peak at 1700. The 1H NMR has several peaks, none of which are vinyl hydrogens (so no double bonds or something like that). There are specific splitting patterns: a doublet of triplets of quartets and another as a doublet of triplets of triplets. The options are four different structures, all seem to have a carboxylic acid group based on the COOH in each.

First, let's think about the FTIR. A broad peak around 3000 cm^-1 usually indicates O-H stretching. But wait, the peak is very broad. Hmm, carboxylic acids have a broad O-H stretch because the -OH can hydrogen bond. So that makes sense here. The strong peak at 1700 cm^-1 is likely a carbonyl group, which fits with the COOH group because the carbonyl in carboxylic acids is around 1700 cm^-1.

Now, the 1H NMR. No vinyl hydrogens, so no double bonds (except maybe in rings, but given the structures, I don't think any have rings). So all the structures are probably saturated.

Looking at the structures:

Option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH
So the structure is something like pentyl groups attached to the central carbon, then a CH2 before the COOH. Wait, let me write it out. The formula would be like (CH3)(C2H5)C-C-COOH, but wait, actually, the structure is CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2-COOH. So the two middle carbons each have a CH group with substituents. So each of those CHs has a methyl and ethyl group attached.

Option B: CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH
So this would be like CH2CH2 group attached to the central carbons. Wait, no, more precisely: the first part is CH3CH2-, then two central carbons each connected to a C2H5 (ethyl) and a CH group. Then COOH. So structure is CH2CH2-C-COOH, but each central C has a CH and an ethyl?

Wait, maybe I should draw these structures mentally.

Wait, the general structure for each option:

Option A: The structure is CH3–C(H)(C2H5)–C(H)(C2H5)–CH2–COOH. So, the two central carbons each have a CH with C2H5 and CH3 attached? Wait, no. Let me count the substituents.

Wait, each of the two central carbons in options A and C are each attached to two substituents. Let me parse the structures correctly.

Option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH. So the structure is:

- The molecule starts with CH3- then a C connected to H, C2H5 (so that's CH(CH2CH3)), then another C connected to H and C2H5 (CH(CH2CH3)), then CH2COOH.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think of it as:

The four carbons before the COOH are:

CH3–C(H)(C2H5)–C(H)(C2H5)–CH2–COOH.

So, the first carbon after CH3 is a CH group attached to an ethyl. Then the next carbon is another CH attached to ethyl
