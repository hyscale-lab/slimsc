Okay, so I've got this question about radioactive decay, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says that an atom has a decay probability of 32% within 100 minutes. So, after 100 minutes, there's a 32% chance it has decayed. That makes me think about half-life concepts, but wait, 32% isn't exactly a half-life. Hmm.

Wait, radioactive decay usually follows an exponential decay model. The decay probability depends on time, and it's memoryless. Oh right, the probability of decay doesn't depend on how much time has already passed; it's only about the remaining time.

So, if the probability of decaying in 100 minutes is 32%, that must relate to the decay constant. The formula for the probability of decay is P = 1 - e^(-λt), where λ is the decay constant and t is time. Or wait, actually, P is the probability of decay, so 32% is 0.32. So 0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ*100). Let me solve for λ.

Rearranging that equation: e^(-100λ) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68. Taking the natural log of both sides: -100λ = ln(0.68). So λ = -ln(0.68)/100.

Calculating that: ln(0.68) is approximately -0.385. So λ ≈ 0.385 / 100 = 0.00385 per minute.

Now, the question says that 50 minutes have passed and the atom hasn't decayed. So now, we're looking at the next 150 minutes. Wait, but 50 + 150 is 200 minutes. Or wait, no, because the initial 100-minute period is over. Let me think again.

Wait, no. The initial 100 minutes is the time frame given for the 32% probability. So if 50 minutes have passed, that's half of 100. But in radioactive decay, the probability for a certain time period is independent of when you start. So the probability of decay in the next T minutes is always 1 - e^(-λT), regardless of how much time has already passed.

So in this case, the question is: what's the probability it decays in the next 150 minutes. So T is 150 minutes.

So using the same λ, compute P = 1 - e^(-λ*150).

We've found λ to be approximately 0.00385 per minute.

Calculating λ*T: 0.00385 * 150 = 0.5775.

So e^(-0.5775) ≈ let's see. e^(-0.5775). Hmm, e^(-0.5) is about 0.6065, and e^(-0.6) is about 0.5488. So 0.5775 is between 0.5 and 0.6. Let me calculate it roughly. 0.5775 is 0.0775 above 0.5. The difference between 0.5 and 0.6 is 0.1 in the exponent, which causes the result to go from about 0.6065 to 0.5488, a decrease of about 0.0577 over 0.1 increase in exponent. So 0.0775 is 0.0775 / 0.1 = 0.775 of the way from 0.5 to 0.6. So the decrease from 0.6065 is approximately 0.0577 * 0.775 ≈ 0.0448. So 0.6065 - 0.0448 ≈ 0.5617. So e^(-0.5775) ≈ 0.5617.

So P = 1 - 0.5617 = 0.4383, which is approximately 43.83%.

Wait, but that's not one of the options. The options are 44%, 40%, 52%, 48%. Oh, 44% is option A. So maybe my approximation is a bit off.

Alternatively, perhaps I should be more precise in calculating e^(-0.5775). Let me compute that more accurately.

We can use the Taylor series for e^x around x=0: e^x = 1 +x + x
