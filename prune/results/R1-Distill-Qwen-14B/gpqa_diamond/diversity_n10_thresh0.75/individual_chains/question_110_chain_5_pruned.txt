Alright, so I need to figure out which stars can be detected by both ESPRESSO and HIRES spectrographs. Let me start by understanding the problem.

First, the question says that ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. So, any star with V mag <=17 can be observed. Similarly, HIRES can detect stars brighter than 16 mag, so V mag <=16.5 can be observed by HIRES.

Wait, no. Wait, the question states: ESPRESSO observes stars with V mag brighter than 17. So, they can observe stars that are brighter (lower magnitude) than 17. So, if a star's apparent V mag is less than 17, ESPRESSO can see it. Similarly, HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag. So, for a star to be detected by both, its apparent V magnitude must be <=16 mag because ESPRESSO needs it to be <=17, but HIRES requires it to be <=16.

Wait, no: Wait, the question says that ESPRESSO can observe stars with V mag brighter than 17. So, V mag less than or equal to 17. Because in astronomy, lower magnitudes are brighter. So if a star is brighter than 17 (V mag <17), ESPRESSO can see it. Similarly, for HIRES, stars brighter than 16 mag (V mag <16) are observable.

Wait, no. Let me re-express this correctly. The way the question is phrased: "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed" with ESPRESSO. So 'brighter than 17' would mean magnitude less than 17. Because lower magnitude numbers mean brighter stars. So for ESPRESSO, stars with V mag ≤17 are observable.

HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag, meaning V mag ≤16.

So, a star that can be seen by both must have V mag ≤16, because that's the stricter condition. Because if V is 16, HIRES can see it, and since 16 is less than 17, ESPRESSO can too. But if V is 17, HIRES can't, only ESPRESSO can.

So the goal is to find stars where their apparent V mag is ≤1
