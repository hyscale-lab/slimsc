Okay, let's try to figure out this problem. So, I'm a bit new to organic chemistry, but I'll give it a shot. The question is about identifying compound E in a reaction scheme. Let's break it down step by step.

First, let's look at the reaction steps:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to form B.
2. B is reduced with H2 and Pd to form C.
3. C reacts with HNO2 to form D.
4. D eliminates an inert gas to form E.

And the hints are:

a) Compound A forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane when reacted with an unknown phosphorous ylide.
b) IR of A has a strong peak at ~1750 cm-1, and E's IR is ~1715 cm-1.

Options are four different ketones, which suggests E is a ketone. Because elimination reactions, especially with inert gases, could form rings or maybe a carbonyl group.

Let me start by considering what each reaction step does.

Reaction 1: A + HCN â†’ B. HCN typically adds to carbonyl groups, like in a nucleophilic addition. So if A is a ketone, B would be a cyanohydrin. Wait, but wait. HCN can also react in other ways. Maybe A is an ester or something else? Wait, the IR of A is around 1750, which is typical for a carbonyl, like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe an acid. But aldehydes have higher absorption (~2800 for the aldehyde C-H) but more importantly, the carbonyl would be around 1720-1700 for aldehydes, but wait, no, wait, aldehydes' carbonyl is around 1720. Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me think: aldehydes are around 2820 and 2720 (the aldehyde C-H stretches) and the carbonyl is around 1720-1710. For ketones, the carbonyl is around 1715 cm^-1. Wait, but the IR for A is 1750, that's higher than typical ketones. Hmm, maybe it's an ester. Esters have carbonyl around 1740-1750 cm^-1. So if A's IR is 1750, perhaps A is an ester.

Wait, but then HCN addition to an ester? Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, maybe A is a ketone, and the IR is 1750 suggests maybe a conjugated carbonyl? Or maybe it's an acid chloride, but IR of acid chloride is around 1800, so that's unlikely.

Wait, another possibility: if A is a diketone or something else. Alternatively, maybe the phosphorous ylide reaction gives a clue about A's structure.

Hint a says that A reacts with a phosphorous ylide to form 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Hmm, phosphorous ylides are typically used in Wittig reactions, which form alkenes. So the product would have a new double bond where the ylide attacked.

Wait, the product from the Wittig reaction is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Let's draw that structure. So cyclopentane ring with substituents at positions 1, 2, and 4.

Wait, the substituents are methyl groups at 1 and 2, and at position 4, there's a propan-2-ylidene group. Propan-2-ylidene is CH2-C(CH3)=, right? Because propan-2-yl is CH(CH3)2, but the ylidene would have the double bond. So the substituent is like CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Wait, no, the substituent
