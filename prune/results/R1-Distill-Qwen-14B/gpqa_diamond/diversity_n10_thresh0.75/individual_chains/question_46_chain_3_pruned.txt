Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question carefully.

The question says: Racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene is treated with Grubbs catalyst. How many possible products are there (excluding ethene)?

Hmm, I remember that Grubbs catalyst is used in olefin metathesis reactions. Metathesis involves the redistribution of alkylidene groups. Grubbs catalyst, specifically, is a transition metal catalyst, usually based on ruthenium, that facilitates this process. It's often used for ring-closing metathesis and ring-opening metathesis, as well as cross metathesis.

Wait, so the starting material here is 3-methylpent-1-ene. Let's draw that structure. Pent-1-ene means the double bond starts at carbon 1, so the structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH₂CH₃)-... Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. Pent-1-ene is CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH₃. But wait, the compound is 3-methylpent-1-ene, so the structure should be CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂CH3? Wait, no, that can't be right because that would make the carbon chain longer. Let me count the carbons.

Pent-1-ene is five carbons with a double bond between C1 and C2. So the structure is CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH3. Wait, but 3-methyl would be a methyl branch on C3. So the structure should be CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3? Wait, that's six carbons. Oh wait, wait a second. No, wait, wait. Let me get this right.

Pent means five carbons. So for 3-methylpent-1-ene, the structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂? No, wait, that's four carbons after the double bond. Wait, maybe I should write the structure correctly.

Pent-1-ene: positions 1 and 2 are double bonded. So the structure is CH₂=CH-CH2-CH2-CH3. Now, 3-methyl would be a methyl group on carbon 3. So carbon 3 is the third carbon. So the structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3? Wait,
