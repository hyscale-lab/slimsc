Okay, I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem. Let me read it again carefully.

So, there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, Star_1's mass is 1.5 times that of Star_2. The question is about their luminosities.

The astronomers found that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest (which I think is the peak wavelength of their blackbody radiation) are the same. Oh right, that's because of Wien's Law, which says lambda_max is proportional to 1/T. So if their peak wavelengths are the same, their temperatures must be the same.

Wait, but wait. Wait, the problem says the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So lambda_max for both stars is the same. So T is the same for both stars. Because lambda_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So same lambda_max implies same temperature.

Wait, but wait again. Unless there's a Doppler shift involved because of their velocities? Because the problem mentions radial velocities: Star_1 has velocity 0, Star_2 has 700 km/s. Hmm, but the peak wavelengths observed would be affected by Doppler shift. So the actual peak wavelength emitted by the star might be different from what we observe.

Wait, but in the question, it says the astronomers determined the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest. Are
