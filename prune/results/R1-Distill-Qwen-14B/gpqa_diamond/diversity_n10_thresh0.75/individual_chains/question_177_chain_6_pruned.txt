Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question says.

Alright, so there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. The problem mentions that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Hmm, I remember that the peak wavelength of a black body's radiation is related to its temperature. The formula is Wien's law, which says lambda_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if their lambda_max is the same, their temperatures must be the same. Oh wait, that makes sense because the problem says the peak wavelengths are the same, so T1 = T2.

But wait, I'm supposed to find the ratio of their luminosities. Oh right, the luminosity of a star as a black body is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4π R² σ T⁴. So L is proportional to R squared times T to the fourth power.

But wait, the problem says that the stars have the same peak wavelength, so T1 equals T2. So the T terms in the luminosity formula will cancel each other out when taking the ratio. So I need to calculate the ratio L1 / L2.

Given that R1 is 1.5 R2, let's plug that into the equation. So L1/L2 = (R1/R2)² * (T1/T2)^4. But since T1=T2, that term is 1. So L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25. So the luminosity of Star_1 is 2.25 times that of Star_2. So looking at the options, option A is ~2.25.

But wait, the problem mentions something about radial velocities. Oh right, the radial velocities are given as 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2. Hmm, does that affect the calculation? Because the radial velocity is the speed at which the star is moving towards or away from us. But how does that relate to luminosity?

Wait a second, luminosity is an intrinsic property of the star,
