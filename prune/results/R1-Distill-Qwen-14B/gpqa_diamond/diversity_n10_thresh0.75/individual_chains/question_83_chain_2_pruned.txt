Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. Hmm, let me think through this step by step. I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base, so the reaction should be straightforward.

The problem says we start with 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. Wait, so the total volume becomes 40 cm³. Oh right, when you mix equal volumes, the concentration halves, right? So the initial concentration after dilution would be half of 0.05 M. Let me calculate that. 0.05 divided by 2 is 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Next, we're titrating this with 0.1 M NaOH. The question asks about the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. Hmm, I'll need to tackle each part separately.

First, let's find the equivalence point. For equivalence, the moles of NaOH should equal the moles of acetic acid. Wait, so moles of acetic acid initially: volume is 40 cm³, which is 0.04 L. Molarity is 0.025 M, so moles = 0.04 L * 0.025 mol/L = 0.001 mol. Since NaOH is a strong base, each mole provides one mole of OH- (or actually, each mole of NaOH gives one mole of OH-). So to neutralize 0.001 mol of acetic acid, we need 0.001 mol of NaOH. 

What's the volume of NaOH needed? The concentration is 0.1 M, so volume = moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. So the equivalence point is at 10 cm³ of NaOH added.

Wait, but wait, the question asks about the pH at 25%. So 25% of the equivalence volume. 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³. So at
