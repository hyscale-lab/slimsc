Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because titration calculations aren't my strongest point, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem is about diluting acetic acid and then titrating it with NaOH. We're supposed to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given, so I need to calculate both values and see which option matches.

Alright, let me break this down. First, the initial solution: 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid is diluted with 20.00 cm³ of water. So, when you mix equal volumes, the concentration halves. Because concentration is moles per volume, and if I double the volume, the concentration becomes half. So the new concentration after dilution would be 0.025 M. Let me check: initial moles of acetic acid (CH3COOH) would be 0.05 M * 0.02 L (since 20 cm³ is 0.02 liters) = 0.001 mol. After adding 20 cm³ water, the total volume is 40 cm³ or 0.04 L. So the new concentration is 0.001 mol / 0.04 L = 0.025 M. Yep, that's correct.

Next, when we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH. Titration typically involves neutralization. The reaction would be CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^-Na+ + H2O. So each mole of acetic acid reacts with a mole of NaOH.

The equivalence point is when moles of NaOH added equals moles of acetic acid initially. The initial moles of acetic acid were 0.001 mol (from 20 cm³ * 0.05 M). So at equivalence, moles of NaOH needed would be 0.001 mol.

But wait, the concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, so the volume needed would be moles / concentration. 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. So the equivalence point is when 10 cm³ of NaOH is added.

But the question asks about 25% titration. So that's 25% of the equivalence point volume. 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³. So at 25% titration, 2.5 cm³ of NaOH has been added.

Let me calculate the pH at both these points.

First, let's tackle the 25% titration point. At this point, some of the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH. Let's figure out the moles reacted and the remaining.

Moles of NaOH added at 25%: 2.5 cm³ * 0.1 M = 0.00025 mol.

The initial moles of acetic acid were 0.001 mol. So moles reacted are 0.00025 mol. So moles remaining of acetic acid: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol. And moles of acetate ion (CH3COO^-) formed would be 0.00025 mol.

But wait, the total volume of the solution is now the initial diluted volume plus the NaOH added. Initial was 40 cm³, adding 2.5 cm³ makes it 42.5 cm³, which is 0.0425 L.

So, the concentrations are:
[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 mol / 0.0425 L ≈ 0.017647 M
[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 mol / 0.0425 L ≈ 0.005882 M

This is a buffer solution. So I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA])

The Ka given is 1.85e-5, so pKa is log(1/(1.85e-5)) → wait, pKa is -log(Ka). Let me compute that. log(1.85e-5) is about log(1.85) + log(1e-5) → 0.267 + (-5) = -4.733. So pKa is 4.733.

Then, [A^-] is 0.005882 M and [HA] is 0.017647 M. So the ratio [A^-]/[HA] is (0.005882)/(0.017647) ≈ 0.3333.

Taking log(0.3333) → since 0.333 is 1/3, log(1/3) is approximately -0.477. So pH = 4.733 + (-0.477) ≈ 4.256. So about 4.26. Hmm, looking at the options, option A has 4.26 as the first value. But wait, what about the other points?

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the volume? Let me double-check the volumes. The initial diluted solution was 40 cm³, and 2.5 cm³ of NaOH is added, so total volume is 42.5 cm³. So calculations look correct.

So pH at 25% is about 4.26.

Now, what about the equivalence point? At equivalence, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate. The solution would be a solution of sodium acetate in water. Since sodium acetate is the salt of a weak acid and strong base, the solution will be basic. So we'll need to calculate the pH based on the hydrolysis of acetate ions.

First, find the concentration of acetate ions. At equivalence, all acetic acid is converted to acetate. The moles are 0.001 mol of acetate. The volume is the initial 40 cm³ plus the 10 cm³ of NaOH, so 50 cm³ or 0.05 L.

Concentration of acetate: 0.001 mol / 0.05 L = 0.02 M.

The acetate ion will hydrolyze in water: CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb for this reaction is Kw / Ka. Ka is 1.85e-5, so Kw is 1e-14, so Kb = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) ≈ 5.405e-10.

The concentration of OH- can be found using the approximation for weak bases, assuming x is small compared to initial concentration. So Kb = x² / (0.02 - x). Let's approximate x as sqrt(Kb * c ), where c is 0.02 M.

x ≈ sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) → sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5. So [OH-] ≈ 1.04e-5 M.

pOH is -log(1.04e-5) ≈ 4.98. So pH is 14 - 4.98 ≈ 9.02. Wait, but none of the options have a pH around 9 at equivalence. Wait, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, the options given are A: 4.26;8.52, B:3.17;6.73, C:4.73;7.00, D:4.57;6.92.

Hmm, none of the equivalence points are around 9. Did
