Okay, so I have this physics problem here about a diatomic molecule and its energy states. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is about the quantum rotation-vibration model, also known as the non-rigid rotor model. The molecule is made of elements X and Y. The given data includes the masses of X and Y, the bond length, and the angular frequency of vibration. We're supposed to find the momentum of a photon that, when absorbed, causes the molecule to switch to the next lowest energy state.

Wait, the molecule is currently in its fundamental state. I think the fundamental state is the lowest energy state, right? So when it absorbs a photon, it needs to transition to the next higher state. But wait, what's the selection rule here? Oh right, for diatomic molecules under the rigid rotor-vibration model, the transition usually involves both vibrational and rotational changes, but I'm not sure about the specifics. Oh wait, the question says it's modeled with the non-rigid rotor model. How does that change things?

Wait, the non-rigid rotor model probably accounts for bond length changes, but maybe for this problem, the bond length is given as a specific value, so perhaps it's treated as fixed. Or maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the possible transitions.

In the rigid rotor model, the energy levels are quantized and given by E_rot = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant. But since this is a rotation-vibration model, perhaps the energy levels are a combination of both rotational and vibrational energies.

Wait, no, maybe the question is about the molecule moving from one rotational state to the next. Or perhaps it's about the vibrational energy state. Wait, the question says it's the next state with the lowest possible energy. So maybe it's a vibrational transition, because the vibrational energy states have higher transitions than rotational ones, but I'm not sure.

Wait, no, the fundamental state in the vibration-rotation model is the lowest vibrational state, but maybe the molecule is in its ground rotational state within that vibrational state. So when it absorbs a photon, it could either increase its rotational state or increase its vibrational state.

Wait, but the question says "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy." So I'm guessing it's the lowest energy transition possible. So which transition gives the least energy? Probably a rotational transition, since the energy spacing between rotational levels is smaller than vibrational.

But wait, the given w is the angular frequency of vibration. So perhaps the photon's energy needs to match the vibrational energy transition? Or maybe the rotational transition. Hmm.

Wait, the problem states that the molecule is in its fundamental state. The fundamental state is the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0). So when it absorbs a photon, it can either go to a higher vibrational state (v=1) or a higher rotational state (J=1). But the question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy. So which of these transitions requires less energy?

The energy for vibrational transitions is given by ΔE_vibrational = hν = h * (w/ (2π)) ), but actually, for a harmonic oscillator, the vibrational energy levels are quantized as E_v = (v + 1/2) h w. So the fundamental state is v=0, E= (1/2) h w. The first excited vibrational state is v=1, E= (3/2) h w. So the transition from v=0 to v=1 would require energy ΔE = h w.

On the other hand, rotational transitions: the energy levels are E_rot = B J (J+1), where B = (ħ²)/(2I), and I is the moment of inertia. The moment of inertia I for a diatomic is I = μ r², where μ is the reduced mass.

So the transition from J=0 to J=1 would require ΔE_rot = B [1(1+1) - 0] = 2 B.

We need to compare which of these transitions (vibrational or rotational) requires less energy. Because the question asks for the photon with the least momentum to achieve the next state, which would be the lower energy transition.

But wait, the problem states that the molecule is in its fundamental state, which is the lowest energy. So the next state with the lowest possible energy would be the first state higher in energy. So which transition is the smallest in energy? The rotational or the vibrational?

Wait, the energy spacing between vibrational states is h w, and for rotational, it's 2 B. So which is smaller? It depends on the values of w and B.

Wait, wait, the given angular frequency w is 4e14 rad/s. Let me compute the energy difference for the vibrational transition. E_vibrational = h w. Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626e-34 J·
