Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a diatomic molecule and the quantum rotation-vibration model. Hmm, I remember that diatomic molecules have atoms connected by a bond, and their movement can be modeled using both rotational and vibrational energy states. The question is about what momentum a photon should have to cause the molecule to transition to the next lowest energy state when it's in the fundamental state.

Wait, the molecule is in its fundamental state. I think that means it's in the lowest energy state, right? So the fundamental state would be the ground state for both rotation and vibration. Oh wait, no, maybe I'm mixing things up. For rotation, the ground state is the lowest rotational energy, and for vibration, it's the lowest vibrational state. So the fundamental state probably refers to the lowest vibrational state with the lowest rotational energy.

The problem says that the molecule switches to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So what's the next state after the fundamental? I think the next possible state would be the first excited state. But I'm a bit fuzzy on whether that's a vibrational or rotational transition. Because in molecular spectroscopy, transitions can be either vibrational or rotational, and the selection rules determine allowed transitions.

Wait, the question is about transitioning to the next state with the lowest energy. So perhaps it's the next higher energy state overall. Since in molecules, vibrational energy levels are quantized and higher than rotational ones. So the ground state might have the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0 or J=1, depending on the model). If
