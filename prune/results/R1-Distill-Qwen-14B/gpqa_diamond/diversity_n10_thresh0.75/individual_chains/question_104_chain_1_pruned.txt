Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. I'm a bit rusty on some of the details, but let me try to think it through.

The question says that there are two stars, both with the same mass as the Sun. Each has a planet, similar in mass to Neptune. So, both planets have about the same mass. The RV method detects these planets by measuring the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum as the planet's gravity causes the star to wobble.

The problem gives the periodic shifts in the spectral lines for both planets. Planet #1 causes a shift of up to 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2 causes a shift of 7 milliangstroms. Wait, but wait, I thought that a larger shift would mean a more massive planet or a closer orbit, but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, the RV method measures the velocity of the star towards and away from us. The formula I remember is that the semi-amplitude of the velocity (K) is proportional to (M_p * sin i) / (M_star)^(1/3) * (1/(1 + M_p/M_star))^(2/3) * (1/(1 - eÂ²))^(1/2). But since the planets have similar masses to Neptune and the stars are similar to the Sun, and the orbits are circular (so e=0), maybe I can simplify this.

But maybe I'm overcomplicating it. The main factors affecting the RV signal (the velocity semi-amplitude K) are the mass of the planet, the inclination of the orbit (sin i), and the distance of the planet from the star (semi-major axis, a). Because the question says the shifts are periodic, so they must be measuring the velocity shifts. The velocity semi-amplitude K is what's being measured here.

Wait, the shift in wavelength is related to velocity via the Doppler shift formula. So the shift in wavelength (delta_lambda) is related to the velocity (v) by delta_lambda/lambda = v/c, where c is the speed of light. So the velocity is v = (delta_lambda / lambda) * c.

But wait, the problem gives the shifts as 5 and 7 milliangstroms. So if the same spectral line is used (same lambda), then the velocity is proportional to the shift. So if Planet #1 has a shift of 5 ma, and Planet #2 has 7 ma, then their velocities (K) are in the same
