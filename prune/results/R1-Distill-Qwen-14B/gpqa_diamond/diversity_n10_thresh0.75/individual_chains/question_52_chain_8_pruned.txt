Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm... The question is about stars with spots and how that affects the ratio of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels. 

Let me read the problem again. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. Without spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. When 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric Teff drops to 5500 K. The question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels, level 1 and level 2. They observed that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does.

Wait, so when there are spots, the ratio decreases. So the ratio without spots is higher than with spots. So the factor would be (ratio without spots) divided by (ratio with spots), which is a number greater than 1.

I remember that in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the number of atoms in different energy levels is determined by the Boltzmann equation. The ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels is given by (n2)/(n1) = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k T) ), where g is the statistical weight, E is energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

Wait, but wait, in this case, the problem is about the ratio n1/n2. Oh, wait no, the problem says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So the ratio (n1/n2) is higher without spots than with spots. Because when T is lower, the ratio would change.

Wait let's clarify. Let's say when there are no spots, T is 6000 K. When spots are present, the effective temperature is 5500 K. The ratio of n1 to n2 depends on T. Let me think about the Boltzmann factor.

The energy difference between the two levels corresponds to a transition at 1448 Å. Let me calculate the energy difference. The energy of a photon is E = hc/λ. But wait, actually, the energy difference ΔE between the two levels is hc/λ. Let me compute that.

h is Planck's constant, approximately 6.626e-34 J·s. c is speed of light, ~3e8 m/s. λ is 1448 Å, which is 1448e-10 meters, so 1.448e-7 meters.

So ΔE = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1.448e-7) 

Let me compute that:

6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m

Divided by 1.448e-7 m: 

≈ 1.9878e-25 /
