Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to figure out what the algorithm does based on the given examples and then apply it to find the value for the input ACAGTGACC. Let me think through this step by step.

The examples given are:
AGG -> 115
TGCTGA -> 176

Hmm, I need to find a pattern or a rule that converts the DNA sequences into these numbers. Let's look at each example closely.

First, AGG. The letters are A, G, G. Let's see what their individual values might be. Wait, maybe each nucleotide has a corresponding number. So A is 1, T is 2, C is 3, G is 4 perhaps? Or maybe another mapping. Let me test this.

If each letter is assigned a numerical value:
A = 1
T = 2
C = 3
G = 4

Then for AGG:
A (1) + G (4) + G (4) = 1+4+4=9. But the output is 115. Hmm, 9 doesn't match 115. So maybe that's not the right approach.

Alternatively, perhaps each letter represents a digit, and the sequence is treated as a number. For AGG, if A=1, G=4, then AGG would be 144. But 144 doesn't equal 115. Wait, maybe it's a different base? Like base 5 or something else. Let me check.

Wait, another thought: Maybe each nucleotide is converted to a number, and then those numbers are multiplied together. Let's try that.

AGG: 1 (A) * 4 (G) *4 (G) = 1*4*4=16. But 16 is not 115. So that's not it either.

Alternatively, perhaps the numbers are summed in a way that's more complex. Let me think: Could it be the sum of each pair of adjacent letters? Like for AGG, the pairs are AG and GG. So AG is 1+4=5, GG is 4+4=8. Then 5+8=13. Still not 115.

Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. What if each nucleotide's position in the sequence contributes to the total? Another idea: Maybe each letter is assigned a value
