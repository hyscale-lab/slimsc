Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question says a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in the lab. We need to find the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer.

Wait, so the glass is moving towards the observer, but the light is going in the same direction as the glass's motion. So the glass is moving towards me, and the light is moving in the same direction as the glass's velocity, which is towards me. Hmm, a bit confusing.

I remember that the speed of light in a medium is c/n, right? Because the index of refraction n is c divided by the speed of light in the medium. So normally, the speed would be 1/n since c is taken as 1 here.

But wait, the glass is moving. So I think this involves some kind of relative motion. Maybe I need to consider the velocity of the light as seen from the lab frame, considering the glass's movement.

Wait, but light's speed is a tricky thing. In special relativity, the speed of light is always c in any inertial frame. But wait, the glass is a medium, not a vacuum. So maybe the usual rules don't apply here.

Wait, the problem is probably assuming that the glass is moving at a non-relativistic speed, so we can use Galilean transformations. Because if v is small compared to c, then we can ignore relativistic effects.

In that case, the speed of light in the medium as observed in the lab would be the speed of the light in the medium (which is c/n) plus the velocity of the medium, but wait, direction matters.

Wait, the light is moving in the same direction as the glass's velocity. So the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is moving towards the observer as well. So from the lab frame, the light's speed would be the speed in the glass plus the speed of the glass?

Wait, no, wait. Let's think about frames. In the glass's rest frame, the light is moving at v_light = 1/n (since c=1). Now, when the glass is moving at velocity v in the lab frame, the lab would see the light's speed as (v_light + v) if the light is moving in the same direction as the glass's
