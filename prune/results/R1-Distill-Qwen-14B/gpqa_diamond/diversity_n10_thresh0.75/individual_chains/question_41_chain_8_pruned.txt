Okay, so I have this physics problem about light traveling through a moving glass. Hmm, I need to find the speed of the light beam relative to the observer in the lab. Let me think about what I remember from my classes.

So the setup is that there's a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the light beam, and it's moving towards the observer. The question is asking about the speed of light in the glass from the lab frame.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. I know that in a medium, the speed of light is c/n, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum. But since the glass is moving, does that affect the speed of light as observed?

Oh right, this probably involves the concept of relative velocity. But wait, wait. In special relativity, velocities don't just add up normally because of the speed limit c. But wait, the glass is moving at speed v, and light is moving at c/n in the glass. So how do we combine these velocities?

Wait, no. The speed of light in the glass is c/n in the rest frame of the glass. But we're looking at this from the lab frame, where the glass is moving. So I think I need to use the velocity addition formula from special relativity here.

The velocity addition formula is (u + v)/(1 + (u v)/cÂ²), right? But wait, in this case, the light's velocity in the glass's frame is u = c/n. But wait, no, I think I'm getting the frames mixed up here. Let me clarify.

Let me define the frames. The lab frame is the observer's frame. The glass is moving at velocity v in the positive x-direction (since it's moving toward the observer, but wait, the light is going in the same direction as the glass's motion. Wait, the problem says the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam. So the beam is going in the same direction as the glass's motion.

Wait, no, the beam is propagating through the glass. So in the glass's rest frame, the light is moving at speed v_light = c/n. But the glass itself is moving at speed v relative to the lab.

So to find the speed of the light in the lab frame, I need to apply the velocity transformation from the glass's frame to the lab's frame.

Wait, but wait a second. The glass is moving at speed v relative to the lab. So if in the glass's frame
