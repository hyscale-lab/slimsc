Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. It's about a particle in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential. Hmm, I think I remember that an isotropic potential means the potential is the same in all directions, so it's symmetric. The potential given is V(r) = (1/2) m ω² r². Oh right, that's the harmonic oscillator potential.

The question is asking about the energy of the third excited state and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for that energy. I need to figure out both parts.

First, the energy levels in a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator. I remember that the energy levels are quantized and depend on the sum of the quantum numbers in each direction. Oh wait, in 3D, the energy is given by E = ħω (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2), but since it's isotropic, we can express it in terms of the total quantum number n.

Wait, wait, actually, another approach is to think about the energy in terms of the principal quantum number. In 3D, the energy levels are E = (n + 3/2) ħω, where n is the sum of the quantum numbers in each direction, n = n_x + n_y + n_z. But wait, sometimes n is considered as the sum of each (n_i + 1/2). No, perhaps I should clarify.

Wait, in three dimensions, each direction (x, y, z) contributes a quantum number n_x, n_y, n_z. Each
