Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about finding the minimum energy of a system of charges. Let me read it again.

The problem says there are 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. Oh wait, e is the elementary charge, right? So each has a charge of 2 times that. But the mass is negligible, so maybe we don't need to worry about kinetic energy or anything like that. 

Twelve of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. And the 13th charge is fixed at point P. So, the setup is like: one charge at the center, and twelve surrounding it at a distance of 2 meters. 

The question is asking for the minimum energy of this system. Energy in electrostatics usually refers to electric potential energy. Right, because the system is isolated, so no external work is being done, and we're looking for the minimum potential energy.

Wait, but I remember that when you bring charges together, you do work against their mutual repulsion, which increases the potential energy. But in this case, since all charges are the same sign (each is 2e, so positive), they repel each other. So bringing them together would require work, increasing the potential energy. But the question is about the minimum energy. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, the charges are already placed: 12 are fixed at 2 m from P, which has the 13th charge. So the system is already in place, so the potential energy is fixed. So we just need to calculate the total potential energy of the system.

But wait, the potential energy of a system of charges is the sum of the potential energies of each pair. Since all the charges are identical, we can calculate the energy for each pair and multiply by the number of pairs.

So the formula for the potential energy between two point charges is U = (k * q1 * q2) / r. Since all charges are the same, each pair will contribute the same amount.

Wait, but in this case, the 13th charge at P is fixed, and the others are at 2 m away. So the 13th charge interacts with each of the 12 surrounding it. So the energy for each of those interactions is (k * (2e) * (2e)) / (2 m). But wait, no
