Okay, so I need to figure out why the scientist's qPCR results have discrepancies. Let me start by understanding the question and the given data.

The scientist made a calibration curve using a positive control with known copy numbers. He diluted it in a series and ran qPCR with three technical replicates each. The efficiency is 100%, which I remember means that each cycle doubles the target DNA perfectly. An RÂ² of 1 suggests a perfect linear relationship, so the data should fit the curve perfectly. The slope is -3.3. 

Wait, the slope in the qPCR equation is related to efficiency. The standard formula is Ct = log(target) * (-1/slope) + intercept, right? Since the efficiency is 100%, the expected slope should be -3.3219 because log2(10)=3.3219 approximately. But wait, the given slope is -3.3, which is close to that. So that fits, meaning the efficiency is correct.

Looking at the Ct values, let's see the data:

100000 copies: 33.9, 34.2, 34.5. So average is about 34.2.

10000 copies: 30.6, 30.9, 31.2. Average 30.9.

1000 copies: 27.3, 27.6, 27.9. Average 27.6.

100 copies: 24, 24.3, 24.6. Average 24.3.

10 copies: 20.7, 21, 21.3. Average 21.0.

Wait, each dilution is 10-fold. So each concentration is 1/10th the previous. Let me calculate the difference in Ct between each dilution. For perfect 100% efficiency, a 10-fold dilution should result in a Ct increase of about 3.3219 cycles. Let's see the differences:

From 100000 to 10000: Ct goes from ~34.2 to ~30.9. The difference is about 3.3 cycles. That's correct.

From 10000 to 1000: 30.9 to 27.6. Difference is 3.3 again.

1000 to 100: 27.6 to 24.3. Again 3.3.

100 to 10: 24.3 to 21.0. Also 3.3.

Wait, that's exactly matching the expected 3.3 Ct increase per 10-fold dilution. So what's the problem here?

The question says there are discrepancies in his results. Let me look again. Each of the technical replicates has a small variation. For example, the 100000 sample has 33.9, 34.2,
