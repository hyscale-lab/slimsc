Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me try to figure it out. The question is about finding the probability of measuring a certain observable and getting a specific outcome. 

Alright, the system's state at time t is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, wait, I think I should write that as a vector. So, the state vector is [-1; 2; 1]. But wait, in quantum mechanics, states are usually represented as column vectors, and they should be normalized, right? So I need to check if this state vector is normalized. To do that, I calculate the sum of the squares of the absolute values of each component.

Let me compute that: (-1)^2 is 1, 2^2 is 4, and 1^2 is 1. Adding those together, 1 +4 +1 =6. Oh, so the norm squared is 6. So the state isn't normalized. Oh, wait, but in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are supposed to have a norm of 1. So maybe I need to normalize it before proceeding. But wait, the observable measurement probabilities might not require normalization if the operator is correctly scaled. Or maybe I should proceed regardless because the operator's properties will affect the outcome.

Wait, the problem says the observable is represented by a matrix operator P. Let me write down matrix P. The first row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0), the second row is (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), and
