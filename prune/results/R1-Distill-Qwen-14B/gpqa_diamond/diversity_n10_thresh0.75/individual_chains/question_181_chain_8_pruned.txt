Okay, so I need to figure out this neutrino flux ratio problem. Let me start by understanding the question. 

The question is about solar neutrinos, specifically their flux in two energy bands after the pp-III branch stops. The pp-III branch is part of the proton-proton chain in the Sun's core. So, I remember that the pp-III process is one of the ways the Sun generates energy through nuclear fusion. 

Wait, the pp chain has different branches. I think the main pp-I branch is the most common, where two protons fuse into deuterium, then another proton, and then the weak force converts one proton into a helium-3 nucleus. But the pp-II and pp-III branches are less dominant. Oh right, the pp-III branch involves higher energy reactions, maybe involving more protons or different fusion paths.

So, in this hypothetical scenario, the pp-III branch stops suddenly. All other reactions continue as usual. I need to find the ratio of the fluxes between two neutrino energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). So, flux_band1 / flux_band2 is what they're asking.

Hmm. Neutrinos are produced in various nuclear reactions in the Sun. The main neutrino sources are the beta decays that happen during these fusion processes. For example, in the pp-I branch, one of the steps is the decay of boron-8 into lithium-8 and a positron and a neutrino. So the neutrinos from the pp-I branch have a certain energy spectrum.

Wait, the pp-III branchâ€”I think it's a higher-energy process. Oh right, the pp-III branch involves the fusion of two helium-3 nuclei into carbon-12. Wait, no, that might be the triple-alpha process. Wait, no, the pp-III branch is a different pathway. Let me think. Oh, perhaps the pp-III process involves multiple protons fusing, maybe in a way that produces higher-energy neutrinos.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe it's better to recall the neutrino production in the Sun. The dominant neutrino source is the pp-I chain, producing neutrinos with energies around 0.5 MeV or so. Then, other branches like the pp-II and pp-III contribute less, but they produce higher-energy neutrinos.

So, if the pp-III branch stops, then the production of the higher-energy neutrinos (like in band 2, which is 800-900 keV) would decrease. But wait, the question says the pp-III branch stopped about 8.5 minutes ago. Since neutrinos travel at nearly the speed of light, it takes about 8 minutes for them to reach Earth, right? So the Sun is about 8 light-minutes away. So if the pp-III branch stopped 8.5 minutes ago, the neutrinos from that process would have already been emitted and are on their way or have arrived. But any new neutrinos from pp-III since then would not be produced anymore. Wait, but the neutrinos are produced in the core, so any neutrinos emitted from the pp-III process before the stoppage would still be reaching Earth now. But the production has stopped, so any neutrinos emitted after that wouldn't come from that process anymore.
