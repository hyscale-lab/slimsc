Okay, so I have this question about neutrinos from the Sun and their flux ratios after the pp-III branch stops. Hmm, let's try to think it through step by step.

First, let me recall what the pp-III branch is. I remember that the proton-proton chain is the main source of energy in the Sun's core. The pp-I branch involves two protons fusing into deuterium, then another proton to form helium-3. Then, there's the pp-II branch where two helium-3 nuclei combine into helium-4. The pp-III branch is probably another part of the proton-proton chain. Wait, maybe the pp-III branch is where a helium-3 nucleus captures a helium-4 nucleus to make carbon-12? Or maybe it's a different process altogether, but I'm not entirely sure. Oh wait, I think the pp-III branch involves a helium-3 and a helium-4 fusing into carbon-12, and that's part of the CNO cycle... No, wait, the CNO cycle is a different thing. Maybe the pp-III is a specific part of the proton-proton chain, perhaps involving higher energy steps.

But regardless, the question says that the pp-III branch suddenly stops. All other reactions continue as usual. So, I need to figure out how this affects the neutrino flux in two specific energy bands.

Neutrinos are produced in various nuclear reactions in the Sun. The main ones are the electron neutrinos from the decay of boron-8, which is a product of the CNO cycle. But wait, the
