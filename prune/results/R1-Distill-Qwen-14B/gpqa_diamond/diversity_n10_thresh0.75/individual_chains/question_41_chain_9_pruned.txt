Okay, so I have this physics problem here. Hmm, let me read it again. Alright, the question is about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. The setup is that a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam, towards the observer in the laboratory. I need to find the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer. The options are given, and I have to choose the correct one.

Wait a second, I remember something about the speed of light in different media. Oh right, in a medium with refractive index n, the speed of light is c/n. Since c is the speed in a vacuum, which here is given as 1, so the speed in glass is 1/n. But wait, that's when the medium is stationary relative to the observer. But here, the glass is moving. So how does that affect the observed speed?

I think this has to do with the relationship between the medium's motion and the light within it. I'm a bit fuzzy on this. Let me think. If the medium is moving, does that add to the speed of light as observed? Or is it more complicated because light is an electromagnetic wave and its speed depends on the medium and the frame of reference.

Wait, perhaps I should consider it in terms of reference frames. The glass is moving at velocity v relative to the lab. So the light beam is moving at speed v_light = 1/n in the glass's frame. But how does that translate to the lab frame?

Hmm, I think I need to use a
