Hmm, okay, so I've got this physics problem here about light traveling through a moving glass. Let me try to figure this out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll think it through.

The question is: A light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in the lab. What's the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the lab? The options are A to D.

Wait, I remember that when dealing with light moving through a medium and the medium itself is moving, there's some relativity involved. Oh right, maybe I need to use the relativistic velocity addition formula because the speeds might not be negligible compared to the speed of light. But wait, the speed of light in glass isn't too much less than c, right? Because n is probably around 1.5 or something like that. So even if the glass is moving at a significant fraction of c, the light speed in the medium itself is v_light = c/n. Hmm, but wait, does the movement of the glass affect the observed speed?

Wait, in special relativity, velocities don't just add linearly. The formula is u' = (u + v)/(1 + (u*v)/cÂ²). But wait, that's when you have a frame moving at velocity v relative to another. Here, the glass is moving at velocity v relative to the lab frame, and the light is moving through the glass. So what's the scenario?

Let me think. The light's speed in the glass is c/n. So in the rest frame of the glass, the light is moving at c/n. But the glass itself is moving at velocity v relative to the lab. So from the lab frame, what's the observed speed of the light?

Wait, but I should probably consider whether the glass's motion affects the light's speed. Because in the lab frame, the light has to account for the motion of the glass.

Alternatively, another approach: When the medium itself is moving, does the speed of light in the medium change? I think the speed of light in a medium depends only on the medium's properties, not its motion. So the speed of light in the glass is c/n, but then how does the glass's movement affect the observed speed?

Wait a minute, perhaps I should think about it in terms of the lab frame. The glass is moving at velocity v towards the observer, in the same direction as the
