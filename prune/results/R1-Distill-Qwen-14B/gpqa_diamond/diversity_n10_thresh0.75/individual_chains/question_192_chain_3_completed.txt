Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me think about what it's asking. 

The setup is an uncharged spherical conductor with a radius R. Inside this conductor, there's a small spherical cavity. The cavity's center is at a distance s from the conductor's center, and the cavity's radius is r, which is smaller than R. So, the cavity is off-center, right? Now, they put a small positive charge +q inside this cavity. 

The question is about finding the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is a distance L from the center of the conductor. But P is also at a distance l from the center of the cavity. Oh wait, and the angle between l and s (the separation between the centers) is theta. So, l and s are vectors, and theta is the angle between them. Also, both l and L are greater than R, meaning P is outside the conductor, not inside the cavity or anything.

Hmm. So, I remember that when there's a charge inside a cavity of a conductor, the conductor's charges rearrange. But since the conductor was initially uncharged, I think the inner surface of the conductor will have an induced charge. Wait, right, Gauss's Law applies here. 

Wait, the conductor is uncharged, so the total charge on it is zero. The cavity has a charge +q. So, the inner surface of the conductor must have a charge -q, and the outer surface must have +q to balance it out. Because the conductor's net charge is zero, so inner surface has -q, outer has +q, summing to zero. 

But wait, the conductor is a conductor, so charges can move freely. The charge inside the cavity (q) will induce a charge on the inner surface of the conductor. So, the inner surface will have -q, and the outer surface will have +q because the total conductor is neutral.

Now, the electric field outside the conductor would be due to the charges on the outer surface. Because the conductor itself is neutral, but the outer surface has +q. Wait, no, the conductor's outer surface has charge +q, so the field outside would be as if the charge q is at the center of the conductor's sphere. Or wait, not necessarily, because the cavity's center is off the conductor's center. So, does that affect the field outside?

Wait a minute. The conductor's outer surface's charge distribution is such that it's as if the charge is uniformly distributed, or does it depend on the position of the cavity?

Wait, no. The conductor is a conductor, so the charges on the outer surface will distribute themselves uniformly, regardless of the position of the cavity's charge. Because the conductor's material allows the charges to move freely. So the outer surface must have a symmetric distribution because the conductor is neutral overall, but wait, no. Wait, the outer surface has a charge of +q, so because it's a conductor, the charge will distribute uniformly on the outer surface, regardless of where the cavity is. So, the field outside the conductor would be as if the charge +q is at the center of the conductor's sphere.

Wait, but wait, the charge in the cavity is off-center, so when the conductor's inner surface gets -q, where is that charge located? It should be on the inner surface, which is a sphere of radius R. So the inner surface's charge -q will be arranged in a way that depends on the position of the cavity's charge. But for the outer surface, since it's a conductor, the charges will distribute uniformly regardless of the inner charge. Because the conductor's material allows the charges to move until they reach equilibrium. So the outer surface's charge is +q and uniformly distributed.

Wait, but this is an uncharged conductor with a cavity containing +q. So the inner surface must have -q, and the outer surface must have +q. Because the conductor's net charge is zero. So the outer surface has +q, which is uniformly distributed.

So, when considering a point outside the conductor, the electric field should be the same as if the charge +q were at the center of the conductor. Because the outer surface's charge is symmetric. So, for any point outside, the field is as if the charge was at the center.

Wait, but the point P is located at a distance L from the center of the conductor. But the charge's position (the +q in the cavity) is off-center. Does that affect the field outside? Hmm. Wait, no, because the outer surface is symmetric. So regardless of where the inner charge is, the outer surface's charge distribution is uniform, so the external field is as if the charge is at the center.

Wait, but that might not be correct. Wait, the inner cavity's position could induce a dipole or something. But wait, no. Because the conductor's outer surface is a conductor, and the charges there are free to move. So the presence of the inner charge (even if off-center) would cause the inner surface to have an induced charge, but the outer surface's charge distribution is uniform because the conductor is a sphere. Because any external influences (like the inner charge) would only affect the inner surface. The outer surface, being a conductor, has symmetric distribution if it's neutral, but in this case, it's +q, so it's uniformly distributed.

Wait, another way to think: When you have a spherical conductor with a charge inside, the outer surface's field is the same as if the charge was at the center. Because the conductor's material allows charges to distribute uniformly in response to the internal charge.

So, the field outside the conductor should be as if the charge +q is at the center of the conductor. So, for a point at a distance L from the center, the field E is (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L². Because the field outside a conductor is the same as for a point charge located at the center.

Wait, but looking at the options, option B is (1/(4πε₀)) q / L². That would be the case if the field is due to the outer charge q, which is uniformly distributed.

But wait, the point P is at a distance L from the conductor's center, but the distance from the cavity's center is l. So, the position of P is not directly aligned with the conductor's center and the cavity's center. So, perhaps the field isn't as straightforward as E = kq/L².

Wait, perhaps I should think about the system using Gaussian surfaces.

The conductor is neutral, but the presence of the charge q in the cavity induces a charge -q on the inner surface. Because the conductor is neutral, the outer surface must have +q.

Now, to find the electric field outside the conductor, I can consider the Gaussian surface outside the conductor. The total enclosed charge is +q (from the outer surface). So, by Gauss's Law, the electric field at any point outside is as if that +q is located at the center of the conductor.

Wait, but wait, the field outside the conductor would depend on the distribution of charge on the outer surface. Since the outer surface is a sphere with charge +q, the field is radial and spherically symmetric, so E = (1/(4πε₀)) (q) / r², where r is the distance from the center of the conductor. So, for point P at distance L, E is (q)/(4πε₀ L²), which is option B.

Wait, but the options also have other possibilities, like options A and C, which involve l and s and the cosine of theta. So why would that be?

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the setup. The point P is at a distance L from the conductor's center, but the distance from the cavity's center is l. The angle between l and s is theta. So, the point P is somewhere outside, but perhaps the displacement from the cavity's center is l.

Wait, maybe the conductor's outer surface isn't spherically symmetric because the cavity's charge is off-center. Wait, no, I thought the outer surface would be symmetric. Because the conductor's outer surface charge is +q, and it's a conductor, so the charges are free to move. So the presence of the inner charge (even off-center) only induces the inner surface's charge, but the outer surface remains symmetric. So for points outside, the field is as if the charge were at the center.

Wait, but is that correct? Because if the inner charge is off-center, the field inside the conductor might have some dipole terms, but outside, the field is still due to the outer surface's charge, which is symmetric. So, regardless of the inner charge's position, the outer surface's field is as if the charge is at the center.

Hmm. So that would make the field at P equal to (1/(4πε₀)) q / L², which is option B.

But wait, perhaps I'm missing something. The point P's position is given as l from the cavity's center, and the angle between l and s (the separation between the centers) is theta. How does that come into play?

Wait, perhaps I should model this using the superposition of fields. The field at P would be the sum of the field due to the charge q in the cavity and the fields due to induced charges.

Wait, but the conductor is a conductor, so the charges on the inner surface are -q, and the outer surface is +q. But the outer surface's charge is uniformly distributed, as the conductor allows charges to move freely.

Wait, but the field inside the conductor is zero. So, the field at P (outside) only depends on the outer surface's charge. Because the inner charges are on the inner surface, but their field outside the conductor would be as if they were at the cavity's center. But wait, the inner surface's charge is -q, located on the inner sphere. However, any point outside the conductor is outside both the inner and outer surfaces, so when you consider the field outside, you only consider the total charge outside the Gaussian surface, which is +q (from the outer surface). So, the field is the same as from a point charge +q at the center.

Wait, but wait, the charge q in the cavity is not a point charge. It's just a charge placed in the cavity. So, the induced charge on the inner surface would be -q, but the outer surface is +q.

So, when you're outside the conductor, the field is as if the charge +q is at the center.

So, the answer should be option B: E = (1/(4πε₀)) q / L².

But wait, looking at the options again:

Option A: 1/(4πε₀) q / (l - s cosθ)^2

Option B: same with L².

Option C: same with (l + s cosθ)^2.

Option D: same with l².

Wait, so if the field is due to the outer surface's charge +q, then the field should be E = (q)/(4πε₀ L²), as L is the distance from the conductor's center. So, that's option B.

But why are the other options involving l and s and theta? Maybe I'm missing something here.

Alternatively, perhaps the field is due to the charge q in the cavity, not the outer surface. Because the charge in the cavity is +q, and the induced charges are -q on the inner surface. But wait, outside the conductor, the field is due to the outer surface's charge. Because the inner surface's charge is enclosed within the conductor, so it doesn't contribute to the external field.

Wait, but the charge in the cavity is inside the inner surface. So, the field outside the conductor is due to the outer surface's charge, which is +q.

Wait, but if the field is only due to the outer surface's charge, then it's as if the charge is at the center, so E = kq / L². So, option B.

But then why are the other options presented? Could it be that the point P is not aligned with the centers, so we need to compute the vector sum?

Wait, that's a good point. If the point P is not along the line connecting the centers of the cavity and the conductor, then the field due to the outer surface's charge would not just be straightforward. Let's think.

The outer surface's charge is uniformly distributed, so the field at any point outside the conductor is as if the charge were at the center. So regardless of where P is located, as long as it's outside, the field E is directed radially outward from the conductor's center, with magnitude kq / L². So, the direction is along the line from the conductor's center to P, so the angle theta wouldn't affect the magnitude, only the direction.

Wait, but the options A, C, and D don't match that. Option D has E proportional to l². Hmm.

Wait, maybe the field is due to the charge in the cavity. Because the conductor is neutral, the field outside is as if the charge is at the conductor's center. But that would mean that the field is due to the outer surface, but the charge in the cavity is inside, so it doesn't affect the field outside. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the conductor's inner surface has -q, and the outer surface has +q. So, when calculating the field at P, which is outside, it's the sum of the field due to the outer surface's +q and the inner surface's -q, but wait, no, because the inner surface's charge is inside the conductor, so their field outside the conductor is the same as if the charge were at the inner surface's center. But wait, the inner surface is a sphere of radius R, and the charge is -q.

Wait, but wait, the field outside the conductor due to the inner surface's charge would be as if the charge were at the center of the inner surface, which is the same as the conductor's center. So, the inner surface's charge contributes a field of -q/(4πε₀ L²) at point P, and the outer surface's charge contributes +q/(4πε₀ L²). So, they cancel each other out. That can't be right.

Wait, no. Because the inner surface's charge is -q, and the outer surface's charge is +q. So, the field at P due to the inner surface would be the same as a point charge -q at the center (since the inner surface is a sphere, so field outside is as if the charge were at center). Similarly, the outer surface's field is as if +q were at center. So, the total field at P would be (from outer surface) + (from inner surface) ?

Wait, but the inner surface is inside the conductor. So, the field outside the conductor is only due to the outer surface's charge, because the inner surface's charge is shielded. So, the field at P is only due to the outer surface's +q. So, E is kq/L², which is option B.

Wait, but in that case, the presence of the inner charge doesn't affect the external field. So, regardless of where the inner charge is placed, the external field is the same as if the charge was at the center of the conductor. So, the answer is option B.

Hmm. So, the other options are perhaps distractions. So, the correct answer should be option B.


To determine the electric field $\vec{E}$ at a point $P$ outside the spherical conductor, we analyze the system as follows:

1. **Setup and Induced Charges**:  
   The spherical conductor of radius $R$ is initially uncharged. A small spherical cavity of radius $r$ (where $r < R$) is present inside the conductor, and the center of the cavity is offset by a distance $s$ from the center of the conductor. A charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity.  
   - The inner surface of the conductor will induce a charge $-q$ due to the charge $+q$ in the cavity.  
   - The outer surface of the conductor will have a charge $+q$ to ensure the conductor remains neutral.

2. **Electric Field Outside the Conductor**:  
   The electric field outside the conductor is determined by the charges on the outer surface. Since the outer surface is a conductor, the charges distribute uniformly, regardless of the position of the cavity or the charge $+q$ inside it. The field outside the conductor is therefore equivalent to the field produced by a point charge $+q$ located at the center of the conductor.

3. **Gaussian Surface Analysis**:  
   For a Gaussian surface outside the conductor (radius $L$ from the center of the conductor), the total enclosed charge is $+q$ (from the outer surface). By Gauss's Law, the electric field at a distance $L$ from the center of the conductor is:  
   \[
   E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}.
   \]

4. **Relevance of Other Parameters**:  
   The distance $l$ from the cavity's center to point $P$, the angle $\theta$ between $l$ and $s$, and the offset $s$ do not affect the electric field outside the conductor. The field is solely due to the uniformly distributed charge $+q$ on the outer surface, which produces a spherically symmetric field. Thus, the field at $P$ depends only on $L$, the distance from the center of the conductor.

5. **Evaluation of Options**:  
   - **Option A**: Involves $(l - s \cos\theta)^2$, which is incorrect because the field outside the conductor does not depend on the cavity's position or the angle $\theta$.  
   - **Option B**: Matches the derived expression for the field outside the conductor, $E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}$.  
   - **Option C**: Involves $(l + s \cos\theta)^2$, which is incorrect for the same reason as Option A.  
   - **Option D**: Involves $l^2$, which is incorrect because the field depends on $L$, not $l$.

Thus, the correct answer is **Option B**. 

Answer: B
