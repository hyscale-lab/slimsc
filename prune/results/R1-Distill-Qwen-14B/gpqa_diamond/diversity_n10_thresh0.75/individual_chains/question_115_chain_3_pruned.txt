Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question again.

An electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. A positron is also moving along the horizontal axis, but from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. After colliding, both annihilate producing 2 photons. The energies of both photons were measured and they have the same value. The directions were also measured. One of the photons was moving in the upper-right direction, while another in the lower-right direction. What is the angle between the directions of the photons?

Hmm, okay. So, the setup is an electron and a positron moving towards each other, collide, and produce two photons. Both photons have the same energy, and their directions are in the upper-right and lower-right. I need to find the angle between them.

I remember that when a particle and its antiparticle annihilate, they produce photons. Since the electron and positron are moving towards each other, their momenta are opposite. Let's think about conservation laws here. Since the system is isolated, the total energy and momentum should be conserved.

Wait, but in this case, the electron and positron are moving with different Lorentz factors. So, their energies and momenta are different. I should probably calculate their rest masses, energies, and momenta.

The rest mass of an electron (and positron) is about 0.511 MeV/c². The Lorentz factor, gamma, is given as 4 for the electron and 2 for the positron.

So, energy of each particle would be gamma * m c². The positron is moving to the right, so its momentum is in the positive x-direction. The electron is moving to the left, so its momentum is negative x-direction, because it's from the left. Wait, no. Wait, the electron is moving from the left, so if the horizontal axis is, say, x-axis, then the electron's velocity is in the negative x-direction, and the positron's is positive x.

Wait, maybe I should set up a coordinate system. Let's say positive x is to the right. So the positron is moving in +x, and the electron is moving in -x.

So, the positron has gamma=2, and the electron gamma=4. Because in the electron's case, since it's moving left,
