Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says that we have a state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. So first, I think I need to normalize this state because when they say it's proportional, that means it's not necessarily a unit vector yet. Because probabilities are based on normalized states.

So, the state is given as |alpha> = (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. The first step is to find the normalization factor. The normalization condition is <alpha|alpha> = 1.

To calculate <alpha|alpha>, I'll compute the inner product. Let's break it down.

The inner product is [(1-i) (because it's the conjugate of (1+i))] * <up| + [(2+i) (conjugate of (2-i))] * <down| multiplied by (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>.

Wait, more accurately, the inner product <alpha|alpha> is [(1-i) (2+i)] because |up> and |down> are orthogonal and each has inner product 1 with themselves. Because when you expand it, <alpha|alpha> = (1+i)*(1-i) * <up|up> + (2-i)*(2+i) * <down|down> + cross terms. Wait, no, actually, because when you multiply it out, you get |a|^2 + |b|^2 because the cross terms would involve <up|down> which is zero.

Wait, let me compute it properly:

|alpha> = (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>

So <alpha|alpha> = (1-i) <up| + (2+i) <down| multiplied by (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>

So, when you expand this:

(1-i)(1+i) * <up|up> + (1-i)(2-i) * <up|down> + (2+i)(1+i) * <down|up> + (2+i)(2-i) * <down|down>

But since <up|down> is zero and <down|up> is zero, the cross terms vanish. So what's left is:

(1-i)(1+i) * 1 + (2+i)(2-i) * 1.

Compute each part:

(1-i)(1+i) = 1^2 - (i)^2 = 1 - (-1) = 2.

(2+i)(2-i) = 4 - (i)^2 = 4 - (-1) =5.

So <alpha|alpha> = 2 +5 =7.

So to normalize, we divide by sqrt(7). So the normalized |alpha> is [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ] |up> + [ (2-i)/sqrt(7) ] |down>.

Wait, but the question says |alpha> is proportional, so perhaps I can just keep it as is because when calculating probabilities, the normalization factor is squared.

But for the probabilities, perhaps I don't need to normalize the state right away. Because the coefficients are (1+i) and (2-i), their squared magnitudes are |1+i|^2 and |2-i|^2.

Wait, |1+i|^2 = (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2.

|2-i|^2 = (2)^2 + (1)^2 =4 +1=5.

So the sum is 2+5=7, which matches the normalization factor 7. So the probabilities are 2/7 and 5/7 for up and down respectively? Wait, wait.

Wait, no, because |alpha> is (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>, so the probability of measuring up is |1+i|^2 /7, and down is |2-i|^2 /7.

Wait, wait, but why 7? Because the norm is sqrt(7), so |c1
