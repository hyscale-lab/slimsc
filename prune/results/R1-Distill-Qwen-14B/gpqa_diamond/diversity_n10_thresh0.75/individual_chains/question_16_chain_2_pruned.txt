Okay, so I have this question about optical activity, and I'm a bit rusty on my stereochemistry, but let me try to think it through. The question gives seven compounds, and I need to determine how many of them are optically active. The options are A to D with numbers 2, 3,4,5. Hmm.

First, I remember that a compound exhibits optical activity if it has chiral centers. Also, compounds with a plane of symmetry won't be chiral because they can be superimposed on their mirror images. So each compound needs to be checked for chirality. 

Let me go through each compound one by one.

1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene
This is an alkene. The Z designation indicates that the higher priority groups are on the same side. Wait, but for optical activity, we're looking for chiral centers. Let me draw this structure. The molecule is CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2. Wait, no, but wait: but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2Cl? Or wait, 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. Structure is Cl attached to C1, which is double bonded to C2. So it's Cl-C=C-CH2CH3? Wait, 2-methyl would make it CH(CH3) on C2. So the structure is Cl-C(CH2CH3)=CH(CH3)? Wait no, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2Cl? Wait, perhaps
