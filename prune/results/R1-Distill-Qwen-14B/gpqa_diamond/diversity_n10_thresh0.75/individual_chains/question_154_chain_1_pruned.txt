Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

So, the chemist found a white solid, and we have some spectral data to identify it. The options are four different compounds. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through.

First, looking at the mass spectrometry data. The molecular ion peak is at m/z = 156 with 100%, and there's another peak at 158 (32%). Hmm, what does that mean? Well, the molecular ion is the molecular weight. So the molecular formula must have a molecular weight of 156. But wait, the other peak is 158, which is 2 higher. That might indicate something like a chlorine isotope. Chlorine has two main isotopes: about 75% Cl-35 (mass 35) and 25% Cl-37 (mass 37). So when you have a molecule with Cl, the molecular ion can split into peaks based on which isotope is present. So molecular ion at 156 would be the Cl-35 version, and the peak at 158 would be Cl-37, meaning the molecule contains a Cl atom. So the molecular weight is 156, and the formula probably includes Cl.

Next is the IR data. There's a broad peak between 3500-2700 cm^-1. Broad peaks in that region usually indicate O-H stretching, like in alcohols, phenols, or carboxylic acids. The strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1 is probably a carbonyl group (C=O). So maybe a ketone, aldehyde, or carboxylic acid. Wait, but if there's a broad peak, it's likely a carboxylic acid because O-H in them is usually broad. Alternatively, maybe an ester or something else, but let's hold that thought.

Looking at the 1H NMR data. The peaks are:
- 11.0 ppm (s, 1H)
- 8.02 ppm (d, 2H)
- 7.72 (d, 2H)

Hmm, 11 ppm is a singlet. That's a strong indication of an aldehyde proton? No, wait, aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10 ppm. Or maybe it's a carboxylic acid proton. Carboxylic acid protons are typically broad and around 10-12 ppm. Wait, in the NMR, the peak is a singlet, which suggests no neighboring H's. So, maybe it's a deprotonated carboxylic acid? Or maybe an aldehyde. Wait, but in D2O, the carboxylic acid would exchange and not show up, but if it's in a solvent that doesn't deprotonate it, maybe it's showing. Alternatively, maybe it's a phenolic O-H, but that's usually broader, right? Phenol O-H is broad but around 5 ppm or so, but wait, no, actually phenol OH is usually around 5-6 ppm, but when they're in more acidic environments, perhaps? Wait, I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, let me think again. The 11.0 ppm is a singlet, so maybe it's an aldehyde proton. But aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm, and a singlet might make sense if there are no adjacent Hs. Alternatively, maybe it's a carboxylic acid proton. Another thought: maybe the singlet is an aromatic proton with no neighboring Hs, but that doesn't make sense because aromatic protons are usually lower, like around 7 ppm.

Wait, the other NMR signals are at 8.02 (d, 2H) and 7.72 (d, 2H). Those look like a pair of doublets, each integrating to 2H. That suggests a para-substituted aromatic ring. So like two protons next to each other in a para arrangement. So maybe a benzene ring with two substituents opposite each other. Like, for example, in benzoic acid derivatives. So if the molecule is a para-substituted benzene, like para-chlorobenzoic acid, or something similar.

So putting this together. Let's look at the options.

Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. That would have a benzaldehyde group and a hydroxyl group in the 3 and 2 positions. The aldehyde proton would be around 9-10 ppm. The hydroxyl would be a broad peak in IR, but in NMR, it's usually around 5 ppm but could be downfield. But in the NMR data, the 11.0 ppm is a singlet. Wait, 3-chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde would have an aldehyde proton and a phenolic OH. The aldehyde would be a singlet, but the OH might be a broad peak, but in DMSO, maybe it's a sharp peak. But the NMR doesn't show a broad peak, just a singlet. Hmm.

Option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Structure: a benzene ring with Cl at position 4, and a COOH group at position 1 (assuming ortho, meta, para). The COOH would have a broad O-H peak in IR, which matches. The NMR would have the COOH proton as a singlet around 12 ppm, but wait, the data shows 11.0 ppm. Also, benzoic acid's COOH proton is usually around 12.7 ppm. Wait, but maybe we're dealing with a different situation. Alternatively, maybe the acid is deprotonated, but in D2O, it would exchange. Or perhaps the solvent is not D2O, so it's a sharp peak. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Option C: Phenyl chloroformate. Structure would be OCl attached to a benzoyl group, like Cl-CO-O-Ph. Wait, no, chloroformate is Cl-CO-O- or something else? Wait, chloroformate is Cl-CO-O-R. So for phenyl chloroformate, it would be Cl-CO-O-Ph? Or maybe Ph-O-CO-Cl? Either way, the functional groups would include an ester or maybe an acid chloride. The IR would show a strong C=O around 1720, which matches. But the NMR would have peaks from the aromatic ring. Wait, but the NMR shows two doublets, suggesting para-substituted. So if it's Cl attached to the benzene ring, and the chloroformate group attached where? If the chloroformate is attached at a position, like para to Cl, then the aromatic protons would be in a para pattern. Alternatively, maybe the chloroformate is attached in a way that makes the aromatic ring have substituents in the para positions.

Option D: 2-chlorobenzoic acid. So Cl is in position 2 relative to the COOH group. So the aromatic ring would have substituents at positions 1 (COOH) and 2 (Cl). The NMR would show a triplet or some coupling, but in the given data, it's two doublets. Let me think: for benzoic acid derivatives, the protons adjacent to substituents would split into certain patterns. For example, in para-substituted, you get two doublets. But in ortho, it's perhaps more complex. Wait, in 2-chlorobenzoic acid, the ring has COOH at position 1 and Cl at position 2. The aromatic protons would be at positions 3,4,5,6. Wait, but if substituents are at 1 and 2, the ring is actually meta to those positions. Hmm, maybe not the case. Let me think about the NMR again.

Wait, the NMR shows two doublets, each integrating to 2H. That suggests two sets of two equivalent protons each, which would be the case in a para-substituted benzene ring. So for example, if substituent X is at position 1 and substituent Y is at position 4, then the protons at positions 2 and 6 would be one set (each adjacent to X and Y), and the protons at 3 and 5 would be another set. Each set would be doublets because each proton is next to only one substituent. Wait, no, in a para-disubstituted benzene, the protons ortho to substituents would be a pair, and the meta would be another pair. If the substituents are identical, then the NMR would have two doublets. So for example, if it's 4-chlorobenzoic acid, the COOH is at position 1, and Cl at position 4. The aromatic protons would be at positions 2,3,5,6. Wait, but that's actually a para substitution on the benzene ring. So positions 2 and 6 are adjacent to COOH, and 3 and 5 adjacent to Cl. So those would each form a doublet.

Wait, let's think about the coupling. Each of the protons adjacent to substituent A would be split by their coupling to the next proton. Alternatively, in a para-substituted benzene, the two protons ortho to substituent A would be equivalent, and likewise for substituent B. So the NMR would show two doublets, each integrating to 2
