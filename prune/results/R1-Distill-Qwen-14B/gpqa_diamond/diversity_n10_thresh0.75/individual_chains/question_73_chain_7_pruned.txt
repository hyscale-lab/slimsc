Okay, let me try to figure this problem out. So, the question is about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and we need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on relativity, but I'll try to recall.

First, the astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c in the positive x-direction. So, both are moving in the same direction, I think. Wait, but relative speed is from the perspective of one astronaut to the other. Right, so we need to find how fast one is moving relative to the other.

I remember that when dealing with velocities in relativity, you can't just subtract them normally like in Newtonian mechanics. There's a relativistic velocity addition formula. Oh right, the formula is u' = (u - v)/(1 - (u*v)/c²), where u is the velocity of the object and v is the velocity of the reference frame.

Wait, in this case, which astronaut's frame are we considering for the relative speed? Let me think. Suppose astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, and astronaut B at 0.5c. So, from A's perspective, B's speed would be (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)). Let me calculate that.

Wait, no, actually, I might have that backwards. The formula is (u - v)/(1 - (u*v)/c²). So if B is moving at 0.5c in the same direction as A's 0.6c, then from A's frame, B's speed is (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/(c²)). Wait that would give a negative, but speed can't be negative. Oh wait, no, I think I got the order wrong. Let me get the formula correctly.

The correct formula is u' = (u - v)/(1 - (u*v)/(c²)), where u is the velocity of the object as seen from the original frame (say, the lab frame where both are moving), and v is the velocity of the reference frame (A's frame). Or wait, no, wait: if I'm in frame S, and I want to find the speed of an object moving at u in S as seen from S', which is moving at velocity v relative to S along the
