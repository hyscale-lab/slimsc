Okay, I'm trying to tackle this quantum mechanics problem about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Hmm, let's break it down step by step.

So, the problem says that the operator Ay is given by c multiplied by matrix S. The constant c is h/(4π), and S is a 2x2 matrix. The first row of S is (0, -i), and the second row is (i, 0). I remember that in quantum mechanics, angular momentum operators are often represented by Pauli matrices or similar structures.

Wait, the Pauli matrices are σx, σy, σz. Let me recall their forms. Oh right! The σy matrix is [[0, -i], [i, 0]], which matches the matrix S given here. So S is actually the Pauli Y matrix. That must mean Ay is (h/(4π)) times σy.

Now, the task is to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. Since σy is a Hermitian matrix, any multiple of it is also Hermitian, which means Ay should have real eigenvalues. Wait, but looking at the options, some mention imaginary parts. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Wait, no, wait. Because S is σy, which is Hermitian, so Ay is Hermitian since c is a real scalar. So eigenvalues should be real.

Wait, but option A says the eigenvalues have imaginary parts, which would imply that Ay isn't Hermitian. But I thought c is real, so Ay should be Hermitian. So maybe option A is incorrect because the eigenvalues for Ay should be real, not complex. Let me think again.

Let me compute the eigenvalues of Ay. To find eigenvalues, I need to solve the characteristic equation det(Ay - λ I) = 0.

So, Ay is (h/(4π)) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. Let me write it out:

Ay = (h/(4π)) * [ [0  -i] 
                  [i   0] ]

So the matrix Ay is:

[ [0, -i*(h/(4π))], 
  [i*(h/(4π)), 0] ]

The characteristic equation is det(Ay - λ I) = 0.

So, the matrix becomes:

[ [-λ, (-i h)/(4π) ] 
  [ (i h)/(4π), -λ ] ]

The determinant is (-λ)(-λ) - [ (i h/(4π) ) * (-i h/(4π) ) ].

Let's compute that:

(λ)^2 - [ (-i^2) (h^2)/(16 π²) ) ]

Since i^2 is -1, so (-i^2) is 1. So the term becomes [1 * (h²)/(16 π²) ) ].

So the equation is λ² - (h²)/(16 π²) ) = 0.

Solving for λ: λ² = (h²)/(16 π²) → λ = ± h/(4π) * (1/2) )? Wait, wait, no. Wait, h²/(16 π²) is (h/(4 π))². So sqrt of that is h/(4 π). So λ is ± h/(4 π) * (1/2) ? No, wait, wait.

Wait, sqrt( (h/(4π))² * (1/4) )? No, wait, no. Let me compute again.

Wait, the determinant is λ² - ( (h/(4π))² * (i * (-i) ) ). Hmm, because the product of the off-diagonal terms is [ (i h/(4π) ) * (-i h/(4π) ) ] = (i * -i) (h²/(16 π²)) ). 

i * (-i) is (-i²) which is 1. So the determinant is λ² - (h²/(16 π²)) = 0.

So λ² = h²/(16 π²) → λ = ± h/(4 π).

Wait, because (h/(4π))^2 is h²/(16 π²), so sqrt gives h/(4 π). So the eigenvalues are λ = h/(4 π) and λ = -h/(4 π).

Wait, but wait, that doesn't look right. Because the Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±1. So when multiplied by a constant, the eigenvalues should be ±c, where c is the scalar.

Oh, right! Because the Pauli matrices σy have eigenvalues ±1. So when multiplied by c, the eigenvalues are ±c. So c is h/(4π), so eigenvalues are ±h/(4π).

So the eigenvalues are real: +h/(4π) and -h/(4π).

Looking at the options:

Option A: says imaginary parts are ±2πh, real parts ±h/(4
