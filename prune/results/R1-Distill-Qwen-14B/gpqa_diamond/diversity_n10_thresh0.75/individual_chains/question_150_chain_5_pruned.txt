Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. Hmm, that's interesting. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation first. The formula is C8H9NO. Wait, N is considered as a heteroatom, but for degree of unsaturation, each double bond or ring is one, and each triple bond is two. So the formula is C8H9NO. Let's compute the degree.

The formula for degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, X is zero. So C is 8, H is 9, N is 1.

So, (2*8 +2 -9 +1)/2 = (18 -9 +1)/2 = 10/2 =5. So five degrees of unsaturation. That could mean a benzene ring (which is 3), an aldehyde group (1, since it's a double bond), and maybe an amine or something else. Or a double bond and a ring, etc. Not sure yet.

The NMR data is given. Let me look at that. The 1H-NMR is:

9.72 (t, 1H) â†’ probably an aldehyde proton. Because aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm as a triplet if there's some coupling. Wait, but in aldehyde, the proton is usually a singlet. Hmm, but if it's adjacent to something else, maybe it's a triplet. Alternatively, maybe it's an acidic proton like an enol or something else. Alternatively, an aldehyde could be split if it's next to another proton. Or maybe it's a phenolic OH, but that's usually broader. Wait, 9.72 is quite upfield for an aldehyde. Or maybe it's an enal, like an alpha,beta-unsaturated aldehyde. The triplet suggests coupling with two protons. Hmm.

Next peak: 6.98 (d, 2H). Downfield, so aromatic. A doublet suggests two equivalent protons, maybe para-substituted on a benzene ring. Because in para substitution, each proton has two adjacent protons, but in para, each proton is
