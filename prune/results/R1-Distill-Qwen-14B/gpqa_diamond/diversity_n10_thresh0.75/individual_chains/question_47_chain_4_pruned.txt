Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. It's about identifying a compound based on its spectroscopic data. The molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Hmm, let me see. The options are A to D, each with different structures.

First, I'll look at the IR data. The strong band at 1720 cm-1 suggests a carbonyl group, probably an ester or amide. Because 1720 is a bit on the lower side for esters, but it's a strong peak, which makes sense. The medium to strong bands at around 3420 and 3325 cm-1 likely indicate N-H or O-H stretches. But O-H is usually broader, and these are medium to strong. Wait, but looking at the options, I see that option D is an ethyl ester of 4-aminobenzoate. So that has an NH2 group. The N-H stretches would be around 3300-3500, which matches the given IR. So maybe it's an amide or amine. Wait, but the IR also has the strong band at 1720, which in the case of an amide would be a carbonyl. But amides have lower wavenumber than esters. Hmm, wait, no: esters are usually around 1720-1760, while amides are a bit lower, like 1650-1700. So 1720 would more likely be an ester. So maybe the compound is an ester with an amine group.

Looking at the NMR data. Let's go through each part. The 1H NMR has the following signals:

1.20 ppm (t, 3H) → likely a CH3 group attached to something with neighboring CH2, like an ethyl group. The triplet (t) suggests two neighboring protons, so maybe CH2CH3.

4.0 ppm (bs, 2H) → broad singlet for 2H. Broad could be due to exchange, like an NH2 group. But wait, if it's a broad singlet, maybe it's an OCH2 group. Or maybe N attached. Alternatively, it could be an NH group that's exchanging, but seeing 2H as a singlet.

4.5 ppm (q,
