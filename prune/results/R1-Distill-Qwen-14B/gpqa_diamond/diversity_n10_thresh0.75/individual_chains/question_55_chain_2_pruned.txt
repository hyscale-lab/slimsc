Okay, so I've got this NMR problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this. Let's see how I can approach it. The question is about identifying an unknown organic compound from its 1H NMR data. The options are four different acetates: Cis and Trans versions of propenyl and butenyl acetates.

First, I'll recall what the structures of these compounds look like. Acetates are esters, so the general structure is R-O-CO-R', where R is the propenyl or butenyl group, and R' is the acetyl group (in this case, methyl). So, for propenyl acetate, R is CH2CHCH2O- or something like that, but wait, propenyl would be CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2- as an allyl group. Wait, no, wait, propenyl is CH2CHCH2- but with a double bond. So, propenyl groups are CH2=CHCH2-O- or maybe CH2CH2CH2 with a double bond elsewhere.

Wait, no. Let me think again. Propenyl is an allyl group with three carbons and a double bond. So, propenyl can be either CH2=CHCH2- (which would be 1-propenyl) or CH3CH=CH- (which is 2-propenyl, which is the same as allyl). Wait, but in esters, the substituents are important. So for propenyl acetate, the structure is CH3COO-CH2CH=CH2? Or CH2=CHCH2-O-CO-CH3? Or maybe CH3COO-CH2CH2CH2 with a double bond elsewhere?

Wait, no. Actually, the structure of propenyl acetate would be CH3COOCH2CHCH2, but wait, that's butenyl. Wait, no. Wait, propenyl is three carbons with a double bond. So, if it's propenyl, it's either CH2=CHCH2-O- or CH3CH=CH-O-. But as an ester, it's R-O-COCH3. So propenyl would be either CH2CH2CH3 with
