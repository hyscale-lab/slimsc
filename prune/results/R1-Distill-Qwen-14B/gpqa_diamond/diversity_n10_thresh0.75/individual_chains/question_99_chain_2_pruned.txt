Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out which compound is the correct one based on the spectroscopic data provided. Let me start by breaking down the information given.

First, the FTIR spectrum shows a very broad absorption around 3000 cm^-1. Broad peaks in IR usually correspond to O-H stretching, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. Since the peak is very broad, I'm thinking it's probably a carboxylic acid because their O-H stretches are quite broad and strong. Also, there's a strong peak at 1700 cm^-1, which is indicative of a carbonyl group (C=O). In carboxylic acids, that carbonyl is part of the COOH group. So that fits with the IR data.

Now, looking at the 1H NMR spectrum. The question says that none of the signals correspond to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are those attached to double bonds, like in alkenes, which usually show up as doublets or other split signals around 4.5-6.5 ppm. Since none of the peaks are vinyl, that suggests the compound doesn't have any double bonds, or the double bonds are not with hydrogens (like in aromatic compounds, but that's probably not the case here since the options don't show any benzene rings).

The NMR has some complex splitting patterns. One signal is a doublet of triplets of quartets, and another is a doublet of triplets of triplets. Hmm, that's pretty complex. Let me think about what kind of structure would lead to such splitting. Splitting in NMR arises from neighboring hydrogens. A doublet of triplets implies that each proton is next to two sets of neighboring protons. Maybe each group is coupling with two different sets of neighboring Hs. 

Looking at the options, the structures are all some kind of substituted pentanoic acid or similar. Let's examine each option:

Option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH. This structure would have a central carbon (maybe the middle CH) attached to two ethyl groups and a CH2COOH. Or wait, maybe it's more like two CH groups each attached to an ethyl and another group. Alternatively, perhaps it's a neopentyl-like structure but with substituents. Let me draw the structure.

Wait, option A is CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2-COOH. So the middle two CH groups each have an ethyl and another CH group attached. So each CH has three substituents: an ethyl, another CH (which is connected to ethyl), and a CH2COOH. So, that would be like two CH groups in a row, each attached to ethyl and the next CH.

Option B: CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH. So maybe this is a straight chain with substituents. The structure would be CH2CH2-CH(C2H5)-CH(C2H5)-COOH. Wait, that might be more like a 4-carbon chain: CH2CH2 is probably CH2CH3, so the structure is CH2CH2-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-COOH. So maybe it's like (CH2CH3)2CHCH2COOH? No, wait, because the central part is CH with another substituent. Hmm, maybe it's a 3-pentanoic acid with substituents. Not sure, need to think about the NMR.

Option C: CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH. So each CH is attached to a methyl group and another CH. So the structure is CH3-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-CH2-COOH. So the central two CHs each have a methyl, and are connected to each other. So each of these CHs has two neighboring groups: the adjacent CH and the substituents.

Option D: CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH. So the structure is CH2CH3-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. So the middle two CHs each have a methyl group, and the chain is longer, with ethyl on one end.

The NMR signals are complex. Let's think about where the proton signals might be.

In a carboxylic acid, the COOH proton is usually a broad peak around 10-12 ppm. But the question states that none of the peaks are vinyl, which is correct because all options are carboxylic acids without double bonds.

Looking for the complex splitting: a doublet of triplets of quartets and a doublet of triplets of triplets. That implies that each proton is split by multiple neighboring groups. For example, maybe a proton is next to two different sets of protons, each of which splits the signal further.

In a structure where a CH is adjacent to two different CH groups, each of which is attached to different substituents, the splitting could be complex. Let's think about the structure of each option.

Option C has two CH groups each attached to two methyl groups. The central CHs are each connected to each other and two methyls. So, each CH has two neighboring CH groups (on either side) but wait, no, the structure would have CH3-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-CH2-COOH. So, the two CHs are in the middle. Each CH is adjacent to another CH on one side and a CH2COOH on the other. Wait, no, the chain is CH3-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH2-COOH. So the middle two CHs are each connected to a CH3 and a CH2 group.

Wait, no. The first CH3 is attached to a CH that has a CH3 and a CH group. So the structure is like:

CH3-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-CH2-COOH.

Each of the middle CHs is attached to a methyl, another CH, and a CH2 group. So for the proton on the middle CH, they're next to two different types of environments. Let's imagine the left CH is next to the right CH and the CH2 group. So the proton on the left CH would be split by the two adjacent CHs. But wait, perhaps each middle CH is connected
