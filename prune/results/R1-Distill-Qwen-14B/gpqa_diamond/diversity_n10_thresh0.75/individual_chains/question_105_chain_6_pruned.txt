Okay, so I have this astronomy problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and try to break it down.

The question is about a star similar to the Sun, with a radius equal to the Sun's. One hemisphere is covered in dark spots. The filling factor is 20%, which I think means that 20% of the hemisphere's surface is covered by spots. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. Because the star is rotating, we observe periodic brightness changes, similar to what we might see if an exoplanet were transiting the star.

The main question is: what would be the radius of an exoplanet that would cause the same brightness variation as these spots? And the options are A to D.

So, I remember that when a planet transits in front of a star, it blocks some of the star's light, causing a dip in brightness. The depth of this dip depends on the ratio of the planet's area to the star's area. The formula I think is (Rp/Rstar)^2, where Rp is the planet radius and Rstar is the star's radius.

But wait, in this case, it's not a planet causing the dip but star spots. So I need to calculate the equivalent depth caused by the spots and then find the planet radius that would cause the same depth.

Hmm, let me think about the star spots. The spots are cooler, so when they rotate into view, the star's overall brightness changes. The brightness variation depends on how much area is covered by spots and their temperature difference.

The effective temperature of the star is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler, so 5000 K. The filling factor is 20% on one hemisphere. So the area covered by spots is 0.2 times the area of a hemisphere.

Wait, a hemisphere is half the star's surface. So the area of a hemisphere is (4πR^2)/2 = 2πR². So the total area of the spots is 0.2 * 2πR². Wait, no, filling factor is the fraction of the visible hemisphere that's covered, so for each hemisphere, it's 0.2 of that hemisphere's area. But since we're looking at only one hemisphere being spotted, maybe the calculation is a bit different.

Alternatively, perhaps the total area of the spots on the entire star is 0.2 * (surface area of a hemisphere). So the surface area of the star is 4πR², so a hemisphere is 2πR². The spots cover 20% of that, so 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR².

Wait no, the problem says that one hemisphere is covered with a filling factor of 20%, which would mean 20% of that hemisphere's area is spots. So the area covered by spots is 0.2 * (2πR²) = 0.4πR².

But how does this affect the star's total brightness? Because the spots are cooler, so when they are on the side facing us, the total emitted light will be less.

The star's luminosity is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR² σ T_eff^4.

When part of the surface is cooler, the total luminosity observed would be L_total = L - (fraction of area) * (T_spot^4 - T_star^4) * (L per unit area).

Wait, maybe more accurately, the total flux from the star when spots are present would be the sum of the flux from the unspotted areas and the spotted areas.

The star's total flux when all its surface is at T_eff is F = σ T_eff^4.

When a fraction f of the surface is at a lower temperature T_spot, the total flux becomes F_total = F * (1 - f) + F_spot * f, where F_spot is the flux per unit area from the spots.

So F_spot = σ T_spot^4.

So the
