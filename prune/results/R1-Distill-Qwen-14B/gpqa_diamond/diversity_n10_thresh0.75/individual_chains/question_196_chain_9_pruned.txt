Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I remember that in classical mechanics, a harmonic oscillator has a maximum speed determined by its amplitude and the spring constant. But this is relativistic, so I guess special relativity comes into play here. Let me think about how that affects things.

The question gives me a one-dimensional oscillator with mass m and maximum amplitude A. The force is F = -kx, which is Hooke's law, so it's a simple harmonic oscillator. But wait, in relativity, the equations change. Oh right, because as the speed approaches the speed of light c, the relativistic effects become significant.

In the non-relativistic case, the maximum speed v_max is given by the amplitude times the angular frequency. The angular frequency ω is sqrt(k/m). So v_max = Aω = A*sqrt(k/m). But wait, that's just the classical formula. But here, the options include terms with c, so relativity is definitely a factor.

I remember that in special relativity, the momentum isn't just mv; it's gamma times mv, where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Also, the energy considerations change. The total energy of the oscillator in the relativistic case would be the sum of kinetic and potential energy, but I'm not sure exactly how that works here.

Wait, the problem is about the maximum speed the mass can reach. So when the oscillator is at maximum displacement (amplitude A), the potential energy is maximum, and the kinetic energy is zero. As it moves towards equilibrium, the potential energy converts into kinetic. At the equilibrium point (x=0), the kinetic energy is maximum, and that's where the speed is maximum.

But in relativity, the kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv². Instead, the total energy is gamma mc², so the kinetic energy is (gamma - 1) mc². So at maximum speed, the total energy is the sum of the kinetic and potential energies. But wait, what's the potential energy in the relativistic case?

Oh, in the relativistic harmonic oscillator, the potential is still (1/2)kx², I think. Because the force is F = -kx, so the potential is V(x) = (1/2)kx². So the total mechanical energy E is the sum of kinetic and potential at any point.

At maximum displacement x = A, the potential energy is (1/2)kA², and the kinetic is zero. So E = (1/2)kA². At the equilibrium point, x=0, all of that is converted into kinetic energy. But wait, in the relativistic case, the kinetic energy is (gamma - 1)mc². So:

(1/2)kA² = (gamma - 1)mc².

Wait, but wait a second. The total mechanical energy is the sum of potential and kinetic. So at x = A, the total energy is (1/2)kA². At x=0, the potential is zero, so the kinetic energy is (gamma -1) mc². So,

(1/2)kA² = (gamma -1) mc².

So gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

But gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So,

1/sqrt(1 - (v_max)^2/c^2) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Hmm, let me solve for v_max.

Let me denote (k A²)/(2 m c²) as a term for simplicity. Let's call it term T = (k A²)/(2 m c²).

So,

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + T.

Taking reciprocal of both sides,

sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1/(1 + T).

Squaring both sides,

1 - v²/c² = 1/(1 + T)^2.

So,

v²/c² = 1 - 1/(1 + T)^2.

Let me compute 1 - 1/(1 + T)^2.

That's [ (1 + T)^2 - 1 ] / (1 + T)^2.

Expanding numerator: (1 + 2T + T²) - 1 = 2T + T².

So,

v²/c² = (2T + T²) / (1 + T)^2.

But T is (k A²)/(2 m c²), which is a small number if m is big or k A² is small. So T² is negligible compared to 2T. But maybe I shouldn't approximate yet.

Wait, let's plug back T.

v² = c² [ (2T + T²) / (1 + T)^2 ]

= c² [ (2*(k A²)/(2 m c²) + (k A²/(2 m c²))² ) / (1 + (k A²/(2 m c²)) )^2 ]

Simplify numerator: 2T is (k A²)/(m c²), and T² is (k^2 A^4)/(4 m² c^4). So,

Numerator: (k A²)/(m c²) + (k^2 A^4)/(4 m² c^4).

Denominator: [1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)]^2.

This seems complicated. Maybe there's a better way to approach this. Alternatively, perhaps I should express v_max in terms of gamma.

Wait, another approach: For a harmonic oscillator, the total energy is conserved. At maximum displacement x = A, all energy is potential, E = (1/2)k A².

At maximum speed, all energy is kinetic, which in relativity is (gamma -1) mc².

So,

(1/2) k A²
