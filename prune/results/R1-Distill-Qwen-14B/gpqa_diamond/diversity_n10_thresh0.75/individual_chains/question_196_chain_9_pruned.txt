Okay, so I've got this physics problem about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me see what the question is asking.

The problem says we have a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass m and maximum amplitude A. It's obeying Hooke's law, F = -kx. We need to find the maximum speed v_max of the mass. The options are given, and the speed of light is c.

Wait, I remember that in classical mechanics, the maximum speed of a harmonic oscillator is when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. So the potential energy is (1/2)kA², and setting that equal to (1/2)mv_max² gives v_max = sqrt(kA²/m). That's the non-relativistic case, which is option C. But this question is relativistic, so things are different.

Relativity comes into play when speeds are significant fractions of the speed of light. So I need to consider relativistic effects here. In the relativistic case, the energy isn't just kinetic; it's the total energy, which includes rest mass energy.

The total energy E of the oscillator would be the sum of the rest mass energy and the kinetic energy. But wait, no, in the harmonic oscillator, the potential and kinetic energies vary as the mass moves. At maximum displacement, the potential energy is maximum and kinetic is zero. At the equilibrium point, kinetic energy is maximum and potential is zero.

But in the relativistic case, I think the energy is not just the sum of rest mass energy and kinetic energy. Oh wait, the total energy E is gamma times mc², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

But how does this relate to the potential and kinetic energy? In the non-relativistic case, the total mechanical energy (PE + KE) is (1/2)kA². But in the relativistic case, perhaps the total energy is the sum of the rest energy plus the maximum kinetic energy. Or wait, maybe the potential energy is still (1/2)kA², but the kinetic energy is different.

Wait, I need to think about the energy conservation in the relativistic scenario. The potential energy is (1/2)k x², so at maximum amplitude A, the potential energy is (1/2)k A². But when the mass is moving through the equilibrium point, the potential energy is zero, and the kinetic energy is maximum. But in relativity, the kinetic energy is not (1/2)mv². Instead, the total energy is gamma * mc², which includes the rest mass energy and the kinetic energy.

So, the total mechanical energy in the system should equal the total energy. But wait, is that true? In the non-relativistic case, the total mechanical energy (PE + KE) is conserved. In the relativistic case, maybe that's not the case. Or perhaps the potential energy is still (1/2)kA², but the kinetic energy is relativistic.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me try to structure this.

In the non-relativistic case:
Potential energy at maximum displacement, U = (1/2)k A²
Kinetic energy at that point is zero.
At equilibrium, x=0, so U is zero, KE is (1/2)mv_max².
So the total mechanical energy is (1/2)kA², which equals (1/2)mv_max². So v_max = sqrt(kA²/m).

In the relativistic case, the situation changes. The total energy (including rest mass) must be conserved. At maximum displacement, the potential energy is (1/2)k A², and the kinetic energy is zero. So the total energy is just mc² (since KE is zero, but wait, mc² is the rest energy). Wait, but that can't be right because when the mass is moving, it has more energy.

Ah, perhaps I'm missing something. Let's think again: At maximum displacement, the mass is at rest in the potential well, so its velocity is zero
