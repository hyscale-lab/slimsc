Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about an annihilation process. Hmm, annihilation usually involves particles and their antiparticles annihilating each other, right? The reaction given is p + p̄ → 2A⁺ + 2A⁻. Wait, so what's happening here? Proton and antiproton are colliding, and producing two A⁺ and two A⁻ particles.

The question is asking for the velocity of particle A. Oh, and the mass of A is given as mA c² = 300 MeV. Wait, so that's the rest mass energy. But the antiproton is moving slowly, so I guess it's moving at a low speed compared to the speed of light? Or maybe that's just a way to say that kinetic energy is negligible? Hmm, not sure yet.

Wait, annihilation processes often involve conservation of energy and momentum. So I need to apply those principles. Let me think. In the center of momentum frame, the total momentum before and after should be the same, right? But wait, the problem says the antiproton is slowly moving. Oh wait, no, the antiproton is moving, but if it's moving slowly, perhaps in the lab frame where the proton is at rest, the antiproton has some momentum. Or maybe the total momentum is zero in the center of mass frame.

Wait, let me clarify. The problem says the antiproton is moving slowly, so I think perhaps the initial setup is that the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving at a low speed. So in the lab frame, the proton is stationary, and the antiproton is moving, but with low velocity. So the initial momentum is just the momentum of the antiproton.

But wait, in the problem statement, the antiproton is moving slowly, so perhaps its kinetic energy is much less than its rest mass energy. That might mean I can approximate things, but I'm not sure yet.

So the initial particles are a proton and an antiproton. Each has mass equal to the proton mass, which is around 938 MeV/c². But wait, since the antiproton is moving, its total energy is higher than its rest mass. But if it's moving slowly, maybe its energy is approximately 2*938 MeV? Wait, no. The proton is at rest, so its energy is its rest energy, m_p c². The antiproton's energy would be gamma m_p c², but since it's moving slowly, gamma is approximately 1 plus (v²)/(2c²), so maybe we can approximate it as m_p c² plus (1/2) m_p v². But I'm not sure if that approximation will hold.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is assuming that the total energy is the sum of the rest energies of the proton and antiproton, plus any kinetic energy. But wait, in the center of mass frame, the total energy is the sum of their energies, and the total momentum is zero if they’re moving towards each other with equal and opposite momenta. But in the lab frame, perhaps the proton is at rest and the antiproton is moving towards it with some velocity.

Wait, maybe I should model this as the proton being at rest and the antiproton moving towards it. Then the initial momentum is all from the antiproton. After the annihilation, the products are four particles: 2 A⁺ and 2 A⁻. So the total momentum after the collision must be equal to the initial momentum of the antiproton before collision.

Assuming that the particles A are moving in some direction, perhaps symmetrically.

But wait, momentum is a vector quantity. So the initial momentum is all in one direction, say the x-direction. After the annihilation, the four particles must have momenta that sum up to the same total momentum.

But since the products are two A⁺ and two A⁻, maybe they have opposite charges but same mass. Wait, but their charges don't affect the momentum, which is about mass and velocity. So the particles A could be moving in any direction, but the vector sum of their momenta must equal the initial momentum.

Hmm, but solving for four particles' velocities sounds complicated. Maybe there's a symmetry that allows us to find their velocities more easily.

Wait, perhaps in the center of mass frame, the total momentum is zero. So if I can calculate the total energy in that frame, and then find the energies and momenta of the particles A, I can then relate their velocities.

But wait, the initial setup is in the lab frame where the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving. So maybe I should first compute the total energy and momentum in the lab frame, then find the velocities of the products.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to work in the center of mass frame, compute the velocities there, and then transform back to the lab frame. Or maybe not. Hmm.

Wait, the problem gives m_A c² as 300 MeV. Proton mass is about 938 MeV/c², so the mass of A is about a third, perhaps? So maybe the A particles are pions or something else, but I don't think that's relevant here.

So the initial particles are a proton and an antiproton. Let me denote their rest masses as m_p c² = 938 MeV each. The initial total energy is the sum of their energies. Since the proton is at rest, its energy is m_p c². The antiproton is moving, so its energy is gamma m_p c², where gamma is the Lorentz factor for its velocity v.

The initial momentum is just the momentum of the antiproton, which is gamma m_p v.

After the collision, four particles are produced: 2 A⁺ and 2 A⁻. Let's assume that each A has mass m_A, and charge doesn't matter for momentum. So the total energy after is 4 times the energy of each A (if they're all moving in the same way), but that's probably not the case. Alternatively, perhaps the two A⁺ and two A⁻ are moving in pairs, each pair moving in opposite directions, but perhaps that complicates things.

Wait, another approach. Since the problem gives m_A c² = 300 MeV, which is much less than the proton mass. So perhaps the kinetic energy of the initial particles is converted into the rest mass plus kinetic energy of the products. But since the antiproton is moving slowly, maybe the initial kinetic energy isn't too high, so the products would have significant kinetic energy.

Alternatively, perhaps I can model this as a conservation of energy and momentum problem.

So in the lab frame, the initial total energy is E_initial = m_p c² (proton at rest) + gamma m_p c² (antiproton moving). The initial momentum is p_initial = gamma m_p v.

After the collision, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the four A particles. And the total momentum is the sum of their momenta.

But dealing with four particles is complicated, so perhaps we can make some assumptions about their motion. If the collision is symmetric, maybe the two A⁺ and two A⁻ are moving in pairs in opposite directions, but perhaps each pair shares the same velocity. Alternatively, maybe all four A particles are moving in the same direction, which is unlikely because that would make the total momentum higher than the initial.

Wait, but perhaps in the center of mass frame, the total momentum is zero. So the products would have to have zero net momentum in that frame. But the lab frame is different. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the total energy and momentum in the initial state, and then set up equations for the final state.

Initial state:

- Proton at rest, so E_p = m_p c², p_p = 0.

- Antiproton moving with velocity v, so E_p̄ = gamma m_p c², p_p̄ = gamma m_p v in the x-direction.

So total E_initial = m_p c² + gamma m_p c².

Total p_initial = gamma m_p v.

Final state:

Four A particles, each with mass m_A, and energies E_A and momenta p_A.

Let me denote each A as having energy E_A and momentum p_A.

But since there are four particles, perhaps they are moving in a symmetric way. Maybe two are moving in one direction, and two in the opposite, but perhaps that's not necessarily the case. Alternatively, perhaps all four are moving together with the same velocity, which would make their momenta additive.

Wait, if all four A particles have the same speed u in the x-direction, then the total momentum would be 4 gamma_A m_A u, where gamma_A is the Lorentz factor for speed u. Then, this must equal the initial momentum, gamma m_p v.

But that's a possible assumption. Alternatively, perhaps they have different velocities, but that complicates things.

Alternatively, maybe all four particles move together with the same velocity, so their momenta add up.

But wait, maybe this is a high-energy process, so the particles are moving at a significant fraction of c.

Wait, but the problem states that the antiproton is moving slowly, which might imply that the total energy isn't too high, so the A particles might not be moving at extremely high speeds. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe I can use conservation of energy and momentum. Let's proceed:

Total energy before = E_p + E_p̄ = m_p c² + gamma m_p c².

Total momentum before = gamma m_p v (in x-direction).

After collision:

Total energy after = 4 E_A,

Total momentum after = 4 p_A,

Assuming each A has same E and p, and same direction.

Wait, but why would they all have the same direction and speed? Maybe because the setup is symmetric. It's possible, perhaps.

So setting up the equations:

Energy: m_p c² + gamma m_p c² = 4 E_A.

Momentum: gamma m_p v = 4 gamma_A m_A v_A.

But E_A = gamma_A m_A c²,

p_A = gamma_A m_A v_A.

So substituting,

4 gamma_A m_A c² = m_p c² + gamma m_p c².

gamma_A m_A v_A = (gamma m_p v ) /4.

Hmm, so from the momentum equation,

v_A = (gamma m_p v )/(4 gamma_A m_A )

But also, from the energy equation:

gamma_A m_A c² = (m_p c² + gamma m_p c²)/4.

Hmm, perhaps I can express gamma in terms of the initial velocity, but wait, gamma is known in terms of v. Hmm.

But maybe I can relate gamma_A and v_A. Since gamma_A = 1/sqrt(1 - v_A²/c²).

But this seems a bit involved, but perhaps we can find a relationship.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express everything in terms of beta (v/c) and gamma.

Let me denote the initial beta of the antiproton as beta_p = v/c.

Gamma_p = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta_p^2).

Then, the initial momentum is gamma_p m_p beta_p c.

The energy is E_initial = (gamma_p m_p c²) + m_p c² = m_p c² (1 + gamma_p).

Wait, no. Wait, the proton is at rest, so its energy is m_p c², and the antiproton's energy is gamma_p m_p c².

So yes, E_initial = m_p c² (1 + gamma_p).

The momentum is p_initial = gamma_p m_p beta_p c.

Now, after annihilation, the four A particles have energies E_A, and momenta p_A.

Assuming they all have the same speed, which is probably a big assumption, but perhaps necessary to solve the problem.

So:

Energy conservation: 4 E_A = m_p c² (1 + gamma_p).

Momentum conservation: 4 p_A = gamma_p m_p beta_p c.

But E_A = gamma_A m_A c²,

p_A = gamma_A m_A beta_A c.

So substituting into the momentum equation:

4 gamma_A m_A beta_A c = gamma_p m_p beta_p c.

Divide both sides by c:

4 gamma_A m_A beta_A = gamma_p m_p beta_p.

Similarly, the energy equation:

4 gamma_A m_A c² = m_p c² (1 + gamma_p).

Divide both sides by c²:

4 gamma_A m_A = m_p (1 + gamma_p).

So now we have two equations:

1) 4 gamma_A m_A beta_A = gamma_p m_p beta_p.

2) 4 gamma_A m_A = m_p (1 + gamma_p).

Hmm. Let me see if I can find a relationship between these equations.

Let me denote equation 2 as equation (a):

4 gamma_A m_A = m_p (1 + gamma_p).

Equation (a): 4 gamma_A m_A = m_p (1 + gamma_p).

Equation 1: 4 gamma_A m_A beta_A = gamma_p m_p beta_p.

Let me substitute equation (a) into equation 1.

From equation (a), 4 gamma_A m_A = m_p (1 + gamma_p),

so 4 gamma_A m_A beta_A = [ m_p (1 + gamma_p) ] * beta_A.

So equation 1 becomes:

[ m_p (1 + gamma_p) ] * beta_A = gamma_p m_p beta_p.

Divide both sides by m_p,

(1 + gamma_p) beta_A = gamma_p beta_p.

So,

beta_A = [ gamma_p beta_p ] / (1 + gamma_p ).

Hmm, that's an expression for beta_A in terms of beta_p and gamma_p.

But I don't know beta_p yet. Wait, but perhaps I can find it from the initial setup.

Wait, but the problem states that the antiproton is moving slowly. So beta_p is small. That might allow us to make some approximations.

If beta_p is small, then gamma_p ≈ 1 + (beta_p²)/2, using the approximation for gamma when beta is small. Since beta is small, beta squared is even smaller, so perhaps gamma_p ≈ 1 + (beta_p²)/2.

But let's see. Let me think: If beta_p is small, then gamma_p ≈ 1 + (beta_p^2)/2.

So,

beta_A ≈ [ (1 + (beta_p^2)/2 ) * beta_p ] / (1 + 1 + (beta_p^2)/2 )

= [ (beta_p + (beta_p^3)/2 ) ] / (2 + (beta_p^2)/2 )

Since beta_p is small, terms like beta_p^3 and higher can be neglected.

So,

beta_A ≈ (beta_p) / 2.

Hmm, interesting. So beta_A is approximately half of beta_p.

But that's under the assumption that beta_p is small.

So, beta_A ≈ beta_p / 2.

Hmm, then I can substitute this into equation (a):

4 gamma_A m_A = m_p (1 + gamma_p).

Again, with m_A = 300 MeV/c², m_p = 938 MeV/c².

So,

4 gamma_A * 300 = 938 * (1 + gamma_p )

But since beta_p is small, gamma_p ≈ 1 + (beta_p^2)/2 ≈ 1.

So,

4 gamma_A * 300 ≈ 938 * (1 + 1) = 938 * 2 = 1876.

So,

gamma_A ≈ 1876 / (4 * 300) = 1876 / 1200 ≈ 1.5633.

Hmm, so gamma_A is about 1.5633.

Then, using the relation for beta_A in terms of gamma_A.

We know that gamma_A = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta_A²).

So,

1.5633 = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta_A² )

=> sqrt(1 - beta_A² ) = 1/1.5633 ≈ 0.64.

Squaring both sides,

1 - beta_A^2 = (0.64)^2 = 0.4096.

So,

beta_A^2 = 1 - 0.4096 = 0.5904.

=> beta_A = sqrt(0.5904) ≈ 0.7683.

So beta_A is approximately 0.7683, which is 0.7683 c.

Wait, but the options given are 0.77c (option A), 0.96c (B), 0.91c (C), 0.86c (D).

So 0.77c is option A, which is close to our approximation.

But wait, this is under the assumption that beta_p is small, and that gamma_p ≈ 1. But wait, if gamma_p is about 1, then the initial velocity isn't that high, which aligns with the antiproton moving slowly.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me think again. The problem says the antiproton is moving slowly. So perhaps the approximation holds.

But let me check the calculation steps again.

Wait, equation (a): 4 gamma_A m_A = m_p (1 + gamma_p).

We approximated gamma_p as 1 because beta_p is small.

But when beta_p is small, gamma_p ≈ 1 + (beta_p^2)/2.

But 1 + gamma_p ≈ 2 + (beta_p^2)/2.

But in the earlier step, when I approximated equation (a), I used gamma_p ≈1, so 1 + gamma_p ≈ 2.

So, 4 gamma_A * 300 = 938 * 2 → 1200 gamma_A = 1876 → gamma_A = 1876 / 1200 ≈ 1.5633.

Which is correct.

Then, with gamma_A =1.5633,

beta_A = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma_A^2 )) = sqrt(1 - 1/(1.5633)^2 )

1.5633^2 ≈ 2.443,

so 1/2.443 ≈ 0.4096.

So 1 - 0.4096 = 0.5904.

sqrt(0.5904)= approximately 0.768, as before.

So beta_A≈0.768c, which is 0.77c, option A.

But wait, the problem says the antiproton is moving slowly, so beta_p is small. But in our calculation, beta_A is about 0.77c, which is a significant fraction of c. That seems a bit counterintuitive because if the initial antiproton is moving slowly, the products might not be moving that fast. But maybe the annihilation process releases a lot of energy, even if the initial KE is low.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming that all four A particles have the same velocity and are moving in the same direction. Maybe that's not the case, and the approximation isn't valid.

Wait, another approach: perhaps in the center of mass frame, the total momentum is zero, so the products must also have zero total momentum in that frame. Then, after transformation to the lab frame, their velocities would account for the initial momentum.

But this approach might complicate things, but let's try.

In the center of mass frame (CM frame), the initial total energy is the sum of the energies of the proton and antiproton.

E_cm = E_p + E_p̄ = m_p c² + gamma_p m_p c².

But in the lab frame, the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving with velocity v. So in the CM frame, the total momentum is zero, which means that the energies of the proton and antiproton are equal and opposite in momentum.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute everything in the CM frame.

Wait, but perhaps using the concept of invariant mass.

The invariant mass squared (s) is (E_total)^2 - (p_total c)^2.

In the lab frame, E_total = m_p c² + gamma_p m_p c².

p_total = gamma_p m_p v.

So s = [m_p c² (1 + gamma_p)]^2 - [gamma_p m_p v c]^2.

Hmm, but maybe I can express s in terms of the proton and antiproton's energies and momenta.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the energy and momentum in the CM frame.

In the CM frame, the total momentum is zero. So the energy is the sum of the energies of the proton and antiproton as seen in that frame.

Wait, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Another approach: since the initial momentum is all from the antiproton, and the products must have a total momentum equal to that, perhaps the four A particles must carry away that initial momentum. So the average momentum per A would be (gamma_p m_p v )/(4).

But each A has momentum p_A = gamma_A m_A v_A.

So,

4 gamma_A m_A v_A = gamma_p m_p v.

Which leads to,

v_A = (gamma_p m_p v )/(4 gamma_A m_A )

But without knowing gamma_p, v, or gamma_A, it's hard to proceed.

Wait, but perhaps the initial kinetic energy is negligible compared to the rest mass. So, in that case, the energy of the antiproton is approximately m_p c² + (1/2) m_p v².

But if v is small, gamma_p is approximately 1, so E_p̄ ≈ m_p c² + (1/2) m_p v².

Then, the total energy E_initial = m_p c² + (m_p c² + (1/2 m_p v^2)).

Which is 2 m_p c² + (1/2 m_p v²).

But then, the total energy after is 4 E_A = 4 gamma_A m_A c².

So,

4 gamma_A m_A c² = 2 m_p c² + (1/2 m_p v^2).

The momentum after is 4 gamma_A m_A v_A = m_p v.

Wait, but if v is small, gamma_A is approximately 1 + (v_A^2)/(2 c^2), which is close to 1.

Hmm, maybe I can make some approximations here.

So,

4 (1 + (v_A^2)/(2 c^2)) m_A c² = 2 m_p c² + (1/2 m_p v^2).

But since v is small, v² is much smaller than c², so maybe we can ignore terms with v².

So,

4 m_A c² ≈ 2 m_p c².

But m_A is 300 MeV/c², m_p is about 938 MeV/c², so 4 * 300 =1200, 2 * 938= 1876. 1200 ≈ 1876? No, that's not correct. So this approximation isn't valid. Hmm, perhaps this means that the initial approximation that the kinetic energy is negligible is incorrect.

So, perhaps the initial kinetic energy can't be neglected, and the antiproton is not moving that slowly.

Wait, but the problem says the antiproton is moving slowly. Maybe that's a hint that the velocity is low, but not necessarily that the kinetic energy is negligible. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should approach this using the conservation of energy and momentum without any approximations, but that might require solving more complex equations.

Wait, but perhaps there's another approach. Let's think about the maximum possible velocity of the products. The maximum velocity occurs when all the products are moving in the same direction. But since the problem gives four particles, perhaps each has a velocity u, and the total momentum is 4 gamma_u m_A u.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to write down the equations again.

From energy conservation:

E_initial = E_p + E_p̄ = m_p c² + gamma_p m_p c².

E_final = 4 E_A = 4 gamma_A m_A c².

Momentum conservation:

p_initial = gamma_p m_p v.

p_final = 4 p_A = 4 gamma_A m_A v_A.

So,

Equation 1: 4 gamma_A m_A c² = (m_p + gamma_p m_p) c².

Equation 2: 4 gamma_A m_A v_A = gamma_p m_p v.

Hmm, but I have two equations and three unknowns (gamma_p, v, v_A). But perhaps I can find a relation between variables.

Wait, but in equation 1, I can solve for gamma_p.

Let's rearrange equation 1:

4 gamma_A m_A = m_p (1 + gamma_p).

So,

gamma_p = (4 gamma_A m_A ) / m_p - 1.

Substituting into equation 2:

4 gamma_A m_A v_A = [ (4 gamma_A m_A / m_p ) -1 ] m_p v.

Simplify the right side:

[ (4 gamma_A m_A - m_p ) / m_p ] * m_p v = (4 gamma_A m_A - m_p ) v.

So,

4 gamma_A m_A v_A = (4 gamma_A m_A - m_p ) v.

Divide both sides by gamma_A m_A:

v_A = [ (4 gamma_A m_A - m_p ) v ] / (4 gamma_A m_A )

= v * [ (4 gamma_A m_A - m_p ) ] / (4 gamma_A m_A )

= v * [ 1 - (m_p)/(4 gamma_A m_A) ) ].

Hmm, but this still leaves v and gamma_A in terms of each other.

Wait, but from equation 1, gamma_p = (4 gamma_A m_A )/m_p -1.

And gamma_p is the Lorentz factor for the antiproton's velocity v. So,

gamma_p = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v^2/c^2)).

So,

(4 gamma_A m_A )/m_p -1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v^2/c^2)).

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I can make an assumption that v is much smaller than c, but earlier that didn't hold because the velocity of A came out to be about 0.77c, which is significant.

Alternatively, perhaps I can assume that the velocity of A is such that gamma_A is small, but I think that's not the case.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the maximum possible velocity occurs when all the products are moving in the same direction, and their momentum is additive. But since four particles are produced, perhaps the maximum velocity is achieved when they all move in the same direction, which would require the antiproton to have a high enough velocity.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the kinetic energy is converted into the rest mass of the A particles. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I can use the fact that the mass of the A particles is 300 MeV, and the initial particles have a combined rest mass of 2 * 938 MeV = 1876 MeV. So the initial rest mass is much larger than the rest mass of the products, which suggests that the products would have significant kinetic energy, leading to speeds close to c.

Wait, but in that case, the velocity of the A particles might be close to c. Looking at the options, option B is 0.96c, which is quite high.

Hmm, but earlier under the small beta_p assumption, I found beta_A is 0.77c, which is option A.

But maybe the slow-moving antiproton is a red herring, and the products end up moving quite fast due to the annihilation.

Wait, maybe I should compute the total energy and see how much energy is available.

The initial energy in the lab frame is the sum of the proton's rest energy and the antiproton's energy, which includes its kinetic energy.

But without knowing the antiproton's velocity, perhaps we can't proceed. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is assuming that the antiproton's kinetic energy is negligible compared to its rest energy, so the total energy is approximately 2 m_p c². Then, the energy available for the products is 2 m_p c².

But 2 m_p c² is 1876 MeV. The products have four particles, each with rest energy 300 MeV, so total rest energy is 1200 MeV. So there's 676 MeV of energy available as kinetic energy, which would allow the products to have significant speeds.

But how to find the velocity from that?

Alternatively, perhaps the process is at rest, meaning the proton and antiproton are moving towards each other with equal and opposite velocities in the lab frame. But the problem says the antiproton is moving slowly, so perhaps it's a non-CM frame.

Wait, perhaps the problem is in the rest frame of the proton. So the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving towards it with velocity v, which is small.

Then, the initial momentum is just that of the antiproton, and the conservation of momentum requires that the products have a total momentum equal to that.

Given that, perhaps the products are moving in such a way that their total momentum equals the initial.

But four particles' momenta adding up to a certain value complicates things. So perhaps the A particles are all moving in the same direction, so their momenta add up.

Assuming that, then:

4 gamma_A m_A v_A = gamma_p m_p v.

And,

4 gamma_A m_A c² = m_p c² + gamma_p m_p c².

So, let me divide the two equations.

Divide momentum equation by energy equation:

(4 gamma_A m_A v_A) / (4 gamma_A m_A c² ) ) = (gamma_p m_p v) / (m_p c² (1 + gamma_p) )

Simplify:

v_A / c² = (gamma_p v) / (c² (1 + gamma_p) )

Wait, perhaps I can write this as:

v_A = [ gamma_p v (c²) ] / [ c² (1 + gamma_p) ]

Wait, no, let me do it step by step.

Left side: (4 gamma_A m_A v_A) / (4 gamma_A m_A c² ) ) = v_A / c².

Right side: (gamma_p m_p v) / (m_p c² (1 + gamma_p) ) ) = [ gamma_p v ] / [ c² (1 + gamma_p) ]

So,

v_A / c² = [ gamma_p v ] / [ c² (1 + gamma_p) ]

Multiply both sides by c²:

v_A = [ gamma_p v ] / (1 + gamma_p )

Hmm, but I still have two variables: v (antiproton velocity) and v_A (A velocity).

But from equation 1: 4 gamma_A m_A c² = m_p c² (1 + gamma_p )

Divide both sides by c²:

4 gamma_A m_A = m_p (1 + gamma_p )

=> gamma_p = (4 gamma_A m_A / m_p ) - 1.

Hmm, so substituting into v_A's expression:

v_A = [ ( (4 gamma_A m_A / m_p ) - 1 ) * v ] / (1 + (4 gamma_A m_A / m_p ) - 1 )

Simplify denominator:

1 + (4 gamma_A m_A / m_p ) -1 = 4 gamma_A m_A / m_p.

So,

v_A = [ ( (4 gamma_A m_A / m_p ) -1 ) v ] * ( m_p / (4 gamma_A m_A ) )

= [ (4 gamma_A m_A - m_p ) / m_p ) ] * v * ( m_p / (4 gamma_A m_A ) )

= [ (4 gamma_A m_A - m_p ) v ] / (4 gamma_A m_A )

Hmm, this seems a bit involved. Let me plug in the numbers.

Given:

m_A c² = 300 MeV → m_A = 300 MeV/c².

m_p c² = 938 MeV → m_p = 938 MeV/c².

So,

m_A / m_p = 300 / 938 ≈ 0.3198.

So,

gamma_p = (4 gamma_A * 0.3198 ) - 1.

But wait, from equation 1.

So,

gamma_p = (4 gamma_A * 0.3198 ) - 1.

Now, substituting into v_A:

v_A = [ (4 gamma_A * 0.3198 -1 ) * v ] * ( 1/(4 gamma_A * 0.3198 ) )

But this still involves v and gamma_A, so perhaps it's not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express v in terms of gamma_p.

From gamma_p = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta_p² ), where beta_p = v/c.

But without knowing gamma_p, I can't proceed further.

Hmm, perhaps I should consider that the problem is designed to have a solution using a particular approach, perhaps by assuming that the initial momentum is negligible, but earlier that didn't work.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find gamma_A in terms of m_p and m_A.

Wait, perhaps the maximum possible energy occurs when all four A particles are moving in the same direction, which would require that their momenta add up to the initial momentum.

But without knowing the initial momentum, I'm stuck.

Wait, another thought: the total rest mass of the products is 4 * 300 = 1200 MeV, which is less than the initial rest mass (1876 MeV). So, the products have some kinetic energy.

Alternatively, perhaps using relativistic energy and momentum, and assuming that all A particles move in the same direction, perhaps we can find their velocity.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of four-momentum.

The initial four-momentum is (E_initial, p_initial c), where E_initial = m_p c² + gamma_p m_p c², and p_initial = gamma_p m_p v.

The final four-momentum is the sum of the four-momenta of the four A particles.

Each A has four-momentum (gamma_A m_A c², gamma_A m_A v_A c, 0, 0), assuming motion along x-axis.

So the sum would be (4 gamma_A m_A c², 4 gamma_A m_A v_A c, 0, 0).

Setting initial equal to final:

E_initial = 4 gamma_A m_A c²,

p_initial c = 4 gamma_A m_A v_A c.

We can write these as:

m_p c² (1 + gamma_p) = 4 gamma_A m_A c²,

gamma_p m_p v = 4 gamma_A m_A v_A.

Let me divide the two equations to eliminate c:

( m_p c² (1 + gamma_p) ) / ( gamma_p m_p v ) ) = (4 gamma_A m_A c² ) / (4 gamma_A m_A v_A c )

Simplify:

( c (1 + gamma_p) ) / ( gamma_p v ) ) = ( c ) / ( v_A )

Cancel c:

( (1 + gamma_p) ) / ( gamma_p v ) = 1 / v_A.

So,

v_A = ( gamma_p v ) / (1 + gamma_p )

Hmm, but that's the same as before.

Let me try to find gamma_p from the first equation.

From the energy equation:

m_p c² (1 + gamma_p) = 4 gamma_A m_A c².

Divide both sides by c²:

m_p (1 + gamma_p ) = 4 gamma_A m_A.

So,

gamma_p = (4 gamma_A m_A)/ m_p -1.

Hmm.

But then v_A = (gamma_p v )/(1 + gamma_p )

Substituting gamma_p:

v_A = [ (4 gamma_A m_A / m_p -1 ) v ] / [ 1 + 4 gamma_A m_A / m_p -1 ]

= [ (4 gamma_A m_A - m_p ) / m_p * v ] / [ (4 gamma_A m_A ) / m_p ]

= [ (4 gamma_A m_A - m_p ) v ] * ( m_p ) / (4 gamma_A m_A m_p )

Wait, perhaps that's a miscalculation. Let me re-express:

Denominator: 1 + gamma_p = 1 + (4 gamma_A m_A / m_p ) -1 = 4 gamma_A m_A / m_p.

So,

v_A = [ (4 gamma_A m_A / m_p -1 ) * v ] / (4 gamma_A m_A / m_p )

= [ (4 gamma_A m_A - m_p ) / m_p * v ] * m_p / (4 gamma_A m_A )

= [ (4 gamma_A m_A - m_p ) v ] / (4 gamma_A m_A )

Hmm.

But I still have variables v and gamma_A, which depend on each other.

Perhaps I can find gamma_A in terms of v.

Wait, using the relation v_A = (gamma_p v )/(1 + gamma_p )

And gamma_p = 4 gamma_A m_A / m_p -1.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I can substitute gamma_p from gamma_p = 4 gamma_A m_A / m_p -1 into the expression for v_A.

Wait, v_A = (gamma_p v )/(1 + gamma_p )

= [ (4 gamma_A m_A/m_p -1 ) v ] / [1 + (4 gamma_A m_A/m_p -1) ]

= [ (4 gamma_A m_A - m_p ) / m_p * v ] / [ (4 gamma_A m_A - m_p ) / m_p ]

= [ (4 gamma_A m_A - m_p ) v / m_p ] * [ m_p / (4 gamma_A m_A - m_p ) )

= v.

Hmm, that can't be right. Did I make a mistake in the algebra?

Wait,

gamma_p = (4 gamma_A m_A/m_p ) -1.

So,

gamma_p = (4 gamma_A (300) ) /938 ) -1.

= (1200 gamma_A ) /938 -1 ≈ (1.28 gamma_A ) -1.

So,

v_A = [ ( (1.28 gamma_A ) -1 ) * v ] / (1 + (1.28 gamma_A ) -1 )

= [ (1.28 gamma_A -1 ) v ] / (1.28 gamma_A )

= v * [ (1.28 gamma_A -1 ) / (1.28 gamma_A ) ]

= v * [ 1 - (1)/(1.28 gamma_A ) ) ]

Hmm, but without knowing v, I can't proceed.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express everything in terms of gamma_A.

But time is limited, and I think perhaps the correct approach is to make the initial assumption that the antiproton is moving slowly, so its gamma_p is approximately 1, and beta_p is small.

Wait, if beta_p is small, then gamma_p ≈1.

So, from equation 1:

4 gamma_A m_A = m_p (1 + 1 ) = 2 m_p.

So,

gamma_A = (2 m_p) / (4 m_A ) ) = (m_p)/(2 m_A ) = 938 / (2*300 ) ≈ 938 /600 ≈1.5633.

Which is the same as before.

Then, beta_A = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma_A^2 )) = sqrt(1 - 1/(1.5633)^2 ) ≈ sqrt(1 - 0.4096 )= sqrt(0.5904 )= approx 0.768c.

Which is about 0.77c, option A.

So, the velocity of A is approximately 0.77c, option A.


To solve the problem, we analyze the annihilation process \( p + \bar{p} \rightarrow 2A^+ + 2A^- \) using conservation of energy and momentum. The antiproton is moving slowly, and the rest mass energy of particle \( A \) is given as \( m_A c^2 = 300 \, \text{MeV} \). The proton and antiproton each have a rest mass energy of \( m_p c^2 = 938 \, \text{MeV} \).

### Key Equations and Assumptions:
1. **Energy Conservation**:  
   \[
   E_{\text{initial}} = E_{\text{final}}
   \]
   - Initial energy: \( E_{\text{initial}} = m_p c^2 + \gamma_p m_p c^2 \), where \( \gamma_p = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \beta_p^2}} \) is the Lorentz factor for the antiproton's velocity \( \beta_p = v/c \).
   - Final energy: \( E_{\text{final}} = 4 \gamma_A m_A c^2 \), where \( \gamma_A = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \beta_A^2}} \) is the Lorentz factor for particle \( A \)'s velocity \( \beta_A = v_A/c \).

2. **Momentum Conservation**:  
   \[
   p_{\text{initial}} = p_{\text{final}}
   \]
   - Initial momentum: \( p_{\text{initial}} = \gamma_p m_p v \).
   - Final momentum: \( p_{\text{final}} = 4 \gamma_A m_A v_A \).

3. **Simplifying Assumptions**:  
   - Since the antiproton is moving slowly, \( \beta_p \) is small, so \( \gamma_p \approx 1 + \frac{\beta_p^2}{2} \). For simplicity, \( \gamma_p \approx 1 \) is used as an approximation.
   - The four \( A \)-particles are assumed to move symmetrically in the same direction, allowing us to equate their total momentum and energy contributions.

### Energy Equation:
From conservation of energy:
\[
m_p c^2 + \gamma_p m_p c^2 = 4 \gamma_A m_A c^2.
\]
Substituting \( \gamma_p \approx 1 \):
\[
m_p c^2 + m_p c^2 = 4 \gamma_A m_A c^2.
\]
Simplify:
\[
2 m_p = 4 \gamma_A m_A \quad \Rightarrow \quad \gamma_A = \frac{m_p}{2 m_A}.
\]
Substitute \( m_p = 938 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \) and \( m_A = 300 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \):
\[
\gamma_A = \frac{938}{2 \times 300} \approx 1.5633.
\]

### Momentum Equation:
From conservation of momentum:
\[
\gamma_p m_p v = 4 \gamma_A m_A v_A.
\]
Substitute \( \gamma_p \approx 1 \) and solve for \( v_A \):
\[
v_A = \frac{\gamma_p m_p v}{4 \gamma_A m_A}.
\]
Using \( \gamma_A \approx 1.5633 \), we find:
\[
v_A = \frac{m_p v}{4 \gamma_A m_A}.
\]

### Relating \( \gamma_A \) and \( v_A \):
The relationship \( \gamma_A = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \beta_A^2}} \) allows us to solve for \( \beta_A \) (and thus \( v_A \)) using:
\[
\beta_A = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma_A^2}}.
\]
Substitute \( \gamma_A \approx 1.5633 \):
\[
\beta_A = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{(1.5633)^2}} \approx \sqrt{1 - 0.4096} \approx \sqrt{0.5904} \approx 0.768.
\]
Thus, \( v_A \approx 0.768c \), which corresponds to **0.77c**.

### Final Answer:
The velocity of particle \( A \) is approximately \( 0.77c \).
