Okay, so I'm trying to solve this multiple-choice question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm. Let me think through this step by step.

Alright, the question says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Wait, no—actually, the iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited as those in star_2. Oh wait, no, the wording says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So the excitation is higher in star_1. But what does that mean in terms of the energy levels?

The energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. I'm assuming that's the energy ΔE between the two levels we're considering. So I think this has to do with the Boltzmann distribution since we're dealing with excitation states in thermal equilibrium (LTE is mentioned, so Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium holds).

The Boltzmann equation relates the relative populations of two energy levels in a system. The equation is n2/n1 = exp( -ΔE/(k*T) ), where n2 and n1 are the number of particles in the higher and lower energy states, respectively. But wait, in this case, it's the excitation level that's considered. So which way does the ratio go?

Wait, the problem states that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited. So n_high for star_1 is twice that of star_2 for the same energy level. Wait, no—wait, the excitation is for a specific energy level. Oh, perhaps the ratio of the populations of the excited state to the ground state is higher in star_1.

Wait, the excitation being twice as much. So, maybe the ratio n_high/n_low is higher in star_1 than in star_2. Let me think. Oh, the problem says that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. So in star_1, the number of atoms in the higher energy level (n_high) is twice that in star_2 for the same level. Wait, no, perhaps it's the ratio of n_high to the total that's higher.

Wait, no, the question states that the 'excited' (i.e., in the higher energy level) atoms are twice as much in star_1 compared to star_2. So n_high for star_1 is 2 times n_high for star_2. Alternatively, perhaps the ratio n_high/n_low in star_1 is twice that in star_2.

Wait, no, the problem says that the specific energy level is twice as excited. So maybe it's the ratio of the excited state (n2) to the ground state (n1) is twice as high in star_1. So, let me denote:

For star_1: (n2)_1/(n1)_1 = 2 * [(n2)_2/(n1)_2]

Wait, but I'm a bit fuzzy on that. Alternatively, perhaps the excitation is the fraction of atoms in the excited state, so if the excitation is twice as much, then (n2)_1/(n1)_1 = 2 * (n2)_2/(n
