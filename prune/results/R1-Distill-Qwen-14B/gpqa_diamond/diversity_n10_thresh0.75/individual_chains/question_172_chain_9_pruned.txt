Okay, so I've got this question about stars and the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I remember that the photosphere is the visible part of a star, right? And when they say the iron atoms are twice as excited, I think that refers to their energy levels. Oh wait, in the context of stars, excitation of atoms is often related to their thermal energy. So maybe it's about the temperature affecting the energy states.

The question states that the energy difference between the energy levels is about 1.38e-23 J. Wait, 1.38 is close to Boltzmann's constant, which I think is 1.38e-23 J/K. Oh wait, Boltzmann's constant k is about 1.380649e-23 J/K. Oh, so the energy difference E is k times something. But wait, the energy levels are quantized, so E = ΔE = k * T * something. Oh, right, the excitation energy is related to temperature via the Boltzmann factor.

So, the Boltzmann distribution says that the population of energy levels is proportional to exp(-E/(k*T)). So for two energy levels, say E1 and E2, the ratio of their populations would be (g2/g1) exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) ), where g is the statistical weight.

In this problem, it's about the same transition in two stars. So, for star 1, the excitation is twice that of star 2. Wait, the question says that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. I'm a bit confused. Does that mean the number of excited atoms is twice as much in star_1, or that their energy is higher? Or maybe that the ratio of the population in that energy level compared to the lower level is twice as much?

Wait, I think the question is that the excitation (the population) of a specific energy level in star_1 is twice as much as in star_2. So if the energy level in question is E, then the ratio of populations in E to some reference level (say, the ground state) is twice in star_1 compared to star_2.

Wait, but the energy difference between the levels is given. Let's assume that the two levels are E1 and E2, with E2 - E1 = ΔE = 1.38e-23 J.

In LTE, the ratio of the populations is given by the Boltzmann factor. So for star 1, the ratio n1(E2)/n1(E1) = (g2/g1) exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

Similarly, for star 2, n2(E2)/n2(E1) = (g2/g1) exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

But the question says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited as in star_2. I'm assuming that this means that the ratio of the excited state population to the ground state is higher in star_1. So, n1(E2)/n1(E1) = 2 * [n2(E2)/n2(E1)].

Wait, no, the statement says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So perhaps for the same transition, star_1 has twice the excitation. So the ratio (excited state population) is twice as high in star_1 as in star_2.

So, (n1(E2)/n1(E1)) = 2 * (n2(E2)/n2(E1)).

But let's write the ratios using the Boltzmann factors. Let me denote the ratio as R1 for star_1 and R2 for star_2.

R1 = (g2/g1) exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

R2 = (g2/g1) exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

So, R1 = 2 R2.

Dividing R1 by R2,

R1/R2 = 2 = [exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) ] / [ exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) ]

Which simplifies to exp( ΔE ( 1/(k T1) - 1/(k T2) ) ) )

Wait, because exponentials when subtracted: exp(A - B) = exp(A) / exp(B).

So,

exp( (ΔE/k) (1/T1 - 1/T2) ) = 2.

Taking natural logarithm on both sides,

(ΔE / k) (1/T1 - 1/T2) ) = ln(2).

But wait, ΔE is given as
