Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Let me try to parse it step by step. Hmm, the question is about finding the maximum orbital period of a second planet that will exhibit both transit and occultation events. Both planets are in the same system, same orbital plane, and their orbits are circular.

Alright, let's break down the given information. The first planet has a radius of 1 Earth radius. Its impact parameter during transit is 0.2. It's orbiting a star that's 1.5 times the Sun's radius. The orbital period is 3 days.

The second planet has a radius 2.5 times Earth's. We're looking for its maximum orbital period such that both transit and occultation events occur.

Wait, what do I remember about transits and occultations? Transit is when the planet passes in front of the star from our point of view. Occultation is when the planet is behind the star, so the star eclipses the planet. For both to happen, the planet must be in a position where it can pass in front and also be hidden behind the star.

I think for a planet to transit, it has to be in a certain alignment. The transit depends on the orbital period and the size of the star and planet. Occultation would require that the planet is in the same orbital plane and the star's position relative to us allows the planet to be eclipsed.

But wait, how does the orbital period relate to these events? Maybe the timing of when each event occurs. Or perhaps the period determines how often these events happen, but the question is about the planet's period, not the events' frequency.

Wait, maybe this has to do with the orbital speed and the distance from the star. Since both planets are in circular orbits, their orbital speeds would depend on their distances from the star.

The transit impact parameter is the distance, in units of the star's radius, between the center of the star and the center of the planet's path during transit. For a parameter of 0.2, that means the planet's path is 0.2 times the star's radius away from the center. But wait, impact parameter usually refers to the closest approachâ€”so if it's zero, the planet would pass directly in front of the star's center. A higher impact parameter means it's further away. But with an impact parameter of 0.2, the planet must be smaller than the star, right? Otherwise, the transit wouldn't occur.

Wait, but the star's radius is 1.5 times that of the Sun. Let me think. No, wait, the star's radius is 1.5 Solar radii. The planet's radius is 1 Earth radius. So the star is larger, so the planet can transit.

Hmm, but for a planet to transit, the orbital plane must be edge-on relative to us. Both planets share the same orbital plane, which is already edge-on because the first planet transits. So the second planet's orbit is also edge-on, so it can transit as well.

But the question is about the maximum period. So what's the condition that allows both transit and occultation?

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. Occult
