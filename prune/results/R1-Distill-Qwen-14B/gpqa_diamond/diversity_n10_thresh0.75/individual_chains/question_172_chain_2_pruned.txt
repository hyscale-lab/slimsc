Okay, so I've got this question about stars and the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm. I'm a bit rusty on my stellar astrophysics, but let's try to think this through.

The question says that iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh wait, I remember that in LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), the excitation of atoms depends on temperature. The Boltzmann equation comes into play here, right?

The Boltzmann distribution equation relates the number of particles in an energy state to the temperature. The formula is something like n_i / n_j = (g_i/g_j) * exp( - (E_i - E_j)/(k T) ), where g is the statistical weight, E is energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is temperature.

In this problem, the specific energy levels have a difference of 1.38e-23 J. Let me denote the energy difference as ΔE = E_i - E_j. But wait, the problem states that the atoms in star_1 are twice as excited, so the population ratio n1/n2 is 2, perhaps? Or wait, maybe it's the ratio between the excited state and the ground state. Let me clarify.

Wait, the question says iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level as those in star_2. So, for a specific energy level, the number of excited atoms in star_1 is twice that of star_2.

Let me denote the number of excited atoms in star_1 as n1 and star_2 as n2. Then, n1 = 2 n2. So n1/n2 = 2.

Assuming that the energy difference is the same for both stars because the same transition is considered, so ΔE is same for both. Also, I think the statistical weights g_i and g_j are the same for both stars, since they're both iron atoms. So the ratio g_i/g_j would be the same for both stars, so they can be factored out.

So, using the Boltzmann equation: (n_i / n_j) = (g_i/g_j) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

But wait, actually, in the photosphere, the atoms are in LTE, so the ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels is given by that equation
