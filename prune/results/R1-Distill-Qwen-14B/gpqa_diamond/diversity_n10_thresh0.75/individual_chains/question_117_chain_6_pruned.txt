Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about organic chemistry, specifically about optical isomerism. Hmm, optical isomerism is when compounds are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, leading to different physical properties like the direction they rotate plane-polarized light. These are also called enantiomers. So the question is asking which of the given moieties exhibit this property.

Let me look at each option one by one.

1. The first one is dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Biphenyl rings are connected by a single bond, right? So the two phenyl groups can rotate around that bond. Wait, but if there are substituents on each phenyl group, can that create a situation where stereoisomerism is possible? Oh, right, in biphenyls, if each ring has substituents that are in positions where they can create enantiomers, like if each substituent is on opposite sides relative to the central bond, then they can have enantiomers. But wait, in this case, the substituents are at positions 2 and 2', and 6 and 6'. So each phenyl has two substituents. Let me think. If the two nitro groups are at 6 and 6', and the two carboxylate groups at 2 and 2', then each ring has two substituents. So for each ring, the substituents (like nitro and carboxylate) are in fixed positions relative to the central bond. But wait, does the central bond allow for free rotation? If it's a single bond, then maybe the substituents can rotate, but if they're in such positions that the arrangement leads to possible enantiomers, perhaps it could have stereoisomers. Alternatively, if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it wouldn't show optical isomerism. Hmm, wait a minute. If the two substituents on each ring are in positions that make the molecule chiral. For instance, if the arrangement around the central bond is such that the two rings each have substituents that are mirrored, then perhaps no. Wait, maybe the molecule is symmetrical. For example, if each ring has a nitro group at 6 and a carboxylate at 2, then the positions are symmetric across the central bond. So maybe this molecule isn't chiral
