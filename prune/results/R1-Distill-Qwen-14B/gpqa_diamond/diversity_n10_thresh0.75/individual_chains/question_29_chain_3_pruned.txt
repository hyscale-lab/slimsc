Okay, so I have this genetics question about barley and mutant genes. Hmm, let's try to figure it out step by step.

The question says there's a drought-resistant barley cultivar, but it has an anti-nutritional compound. The gene responsible has five exons and four introns. They used EMS mutagenesis to create mutants and found changes in the first exon area. The goal is to find which mutation would eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.

The intact gene sequence is given. Let me look at the mutations. Each mutant has a change in the beginning of the sequence, so probably in the first exon.

Wait, the gene structure is exons and introns. Exons are the parts that stay in the mRNA after splicing. So any mutation in the exons will affect the protein, whereas mutations in introns might not unless they're in splice sites.

Looking at the options, each mutant has a different change. I need to see which mutation would disrupt the gene's function, probably by causing a premature stop codon or a significant amino acid change.

Let's look at each mutant.

Intact gene: 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’
Each line is the wild-type and the mutants.

Mutant 1:
5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Comparing to wild type, the 4th and 5th nucleotides are different. Wild is TTT, mutant is TCT. So the first three are ATG, then TTT becomes TCT. So codon 3 in wild is TTT (which is phenylalanine), in mutant it's TCT (serine). So the amino acid changes from Phe to Ser. That's a substitution, but not a frameshift.

Mutant 2:
5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Again, the first part. Wild has TTT, mutant has TTA. So the third codon is TTT (Phe) becomes TTA (Leu). Another substitution, so amino acid changes. But again, not a frameshift.

Mutant 3:
5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’
Looking at the start. Wild starts ATG, then next triplet is TTT. In mutant, after ATG is TT TTA... Wait, let me see. The first part is ATGTTT in wild. In mutant 3, it's ATGTTTT. So the fourth nucleotide is T instead of C? Wait, looking at the sequences:

Wild: 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’
Mutant 3: 5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’
So the first part is ATGTTT vs ATGTTTT? Wait, that can't be right. Oh wait, maybe it's a longer change. Let me count letters.

Wait, the way the sequences are presented, each line is longer. Let me look for where they differ.

Wild starts with ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA
Mutant 3 starts with ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA.

So, from the beginning:

Wild: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT …
Mutant3: AT
