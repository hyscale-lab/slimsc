Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think through it.

The question is asking for the maximum speed of a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator. The oscillator has mass m and maximum amplitude A. It obeys Hooke's law, which is F = -kx. Oh wait, but since it's relativistic, we can't use the classical formulas directly. Right, because at high speeds, relativistic effects come into play.

In the classical case, the maximum speed of a harmonic oscillator occurs when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. The potential energy is (1/2)kA², and kinetic energy is (1/2)mv². So setting them equal gives v_max² = (kA²)/m, so v_max = sqrt(kA²/m), which is option C. But wait, that's the non-relativistic case. The question is relativistic, so I can't directly use that.

Relativistically, the energy considerations change. The total energy of the oscillator would be the sum of rest mass energy and kinetic energy, but I'm not exactly sure how that plays out here.

Wait, the problem states it's a relativistic harmonic oscillator. So the force law is still F = -kx, but the equation of motion would involve relativistic mass or something else. Hmm, maybe using the relativistic equation for force in terms of momentum. Because in relativity, momentum p is gamma m v, where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So the force can be written as F = dp/dt. Let's think about the equation of motion. Newton's second law in relativity is F = d(momentum)/dt, which is d(gamma m v)/dt. But wait, for a harmonic oscillator, the force is also -kx. So maybe the equation becomes d²x/dt² = - (k/m) x, but with relativistic corrections? Or perhaps it's more complicated.

Alternatively, maybe I should think about energy. In the relativistic case, the potential energy is still (1/2)k x², but the kinetic energy isn't (1/2)mv². The total energy E is gamma m c². So when the oscillator is at the maximum displacement (x=A), all the energy is potential. Then, when
