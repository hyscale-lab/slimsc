Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

So, the problem says that an equimolar mixture of salts A and B weighing 7.20 grams was heated to 200°C without air. Then, a mixture of gases was formed. These gases were passed through some tubes, and there are some weight changes observed. The goal is to find the total number of all atoms in salts A and B.

Hmm. The details given are that the gases passed through three tubes. The first tube (number 1) has anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2, which I think is a desiccant, but wait, Mg(ClO4)2 is actually a strong dehydrating agent. Wait, but anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2 is used to absorb moisture, right? So maybe it's acting as a drying agent here, but I'm not sure yet.

Then, the second tube has Ca(OH)2 solution. If the gas is something acidic, like CO2 or HCl, it would react with Ca(OH)2. But the weight of the second tube didn't change, which is interesting. That suggests that whatever gas passed through didn't react with Ca(OH)2. So maybe the gas wasn't acidic enough to cause a reaction, or it wasn't the right kind to react with Ca(OH)2.

The third tube has red-hot copper. So if there's a gas that can react with copper, like CO (carbon monoxide), it would be oxidized to CO2, producing CuO. The weight of tube 3 increased by 0.80 grams. So that suggests that some CO was present, which reacted with Cu to form CO2 and CuO.

Wait, but wait. The problem says the weight of tube 3 increased by 0.80g. But when CO reacts with Cu, the reaction is 2CO + Cu → CuO + 2CO. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The reaction is 2CO + Cu → CuO + CO2? Or maybe it's 2CO + 2Cu → 2CuO + CO2. I'm a bit rusty on this. Alternatively, it could be that CO is oxidized by Cu in the presence of oxygen. Oh, but wait, the setup says it was heated without air, so maybe the initial heating was done in an inert atmosphere, but the gas passed through the tubes after heating. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the gas in tube 3 is CO. Because CO can react with copper when heated. The reaction is 2CO + Cu → CuO + CO2. But wait, I'm not sure if that's the exact stoichiometry. Let me think: the reaction is 2CO + Cu → CuO + CO2. So for every mole of Cu that reacts, one mole of CO is consumed, and one mole of CO2 is produced.

Wait, but if the weight of tube 3 increased by 0.80 grams, that would be the mass of CuO formed. The molar mass of CuO is 80 g/mol (Cu is ~63.55, O is 16, so about 79.55). So 0.80 grams is 0.80 / 80 ≈ 0.01 moles of CuO. So the reaction would involve 0.01 moles of CuO, meaning 0.01 moles of Cu consumed. So, for each mole of CuO, one mole of CO is consumed. Wait, no, let's check:

The balanced equation for CO reacting with Cu is 2CO + Cu → CuO + CO2.

So, for every 2 moles of CO, 1 mole of CuO is formed. So if 0.01 moles of CuO are formed, then 0.02 moles of CO reacted. So CO is the gas that reacted here.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. The mass
