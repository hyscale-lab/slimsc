Okay, so I've got this NMR and LC-MS question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The scenario is that I'm analyzing a small peptidic compound that's been synthesized chemically. The 1H NMR of the crude compound mostly looks right, except there are two peaks for the same alpha-proton. These peaks have similar chemical shifts and their integrals add up to 1H. So each must be about 0.5H, maybe? The coupling pattern rules out spin-spin coupling, so it's not like they're splitting each other or something. 

Then, the LC-MS analysis shows two peaks of equal intensity, same mass. That suggests that both are the same molecule but maybe in different forms, or something about their structure that affects their retention but keeps the mass same.

So, the options are A to D. Let's go through them one by one.

Option A says the compound is contaminated with a precursor. Hmm, if that were the case, the mass spectrum would be different because a precursor (like the starting material before the last step) would have a different molecular weight. But the question says both peaks have the same mass spectrum, so A is probably not it.

Option B is a mixture of enantiomers. Enantiomers are mirror images, so they have the same molecular weight. In LC-MS, they might elute at different times if the column can separate them, but wait, in an achiral column, they might not separate. But the question says the LC-MS shows two peaks with same mass. Or, wait, maybe the column is chiral? Some LC columns are chiral and can separate enantiomers. But the problem says that in the LC-MS, they're at elevated temperature. I'm not sure if that affects it. But if it's a chiral column and the two peaks are enantiomers, then their NMR would show same chemical shifts because the environment is the same. Wait, but in NMR, enantiomers would give the same spectrum because the splitting is the same. But the question says there are two peaks for the same alpha proton. So that suggests something else is causing the split.

Wait, but if it's a racemic mixture, the NMR would show the same peaks as a pure sample because enantiomers don't cause splitting in NMR. So the NMR would look the same as a pure sample because each enantiomer contributes the same peaks. So the fact that NMR has two peaks for the same proton suggests something else. So option B might not explain the NMR observation. Unless the sample is not pure, but wait, if it's a racemic mix, the NMR wouldn't have two peaks for the same proton. Because each proton would be in the same environment, regardless of the configuration elsewhere. So maybe B isn't the answer.

Option C is 'double coupling' during an amide bond formation. I'm not exactly sure what that means. Double coupling perhaps refers to a situation where a proton is coupled to two different sets of equivalent protons. But if that were the case, you might see splitting, but the question rules out spin-spin coupling as the reason. So maybe this isn't it. Or maybe it's a different kind of coupling, like from diastereotopic protons. Wait, could that be? If in the molecule, the alpha-proton is in a position where it's coupled to two different (but equivalent) sets of protons, maybe? But the question says the two peaks have similar shifts and same integrals. Hmm.

Option D is a mixture of diastereoisomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties, so they would elute at different times in LC, which matches the two peaks. They have the same molecular weight, so same mass spectrum. Now, looking at the NMR: diastereomers would have different environments, leading to different chemical shifts. But wait, the problem says the two peaks have similar shifts. So, maybe they
