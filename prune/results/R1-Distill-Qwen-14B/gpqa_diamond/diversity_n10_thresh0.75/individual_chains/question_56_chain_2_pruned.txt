Okay, so I've got this question about the hydrogen atom and transitions between energy levels. Hmm, let me think. The question says that the |3,0,0> state decays to |1,0,0> via two dipole transitions. I need to find the correct transition route and the corresponding probability.

Wait, dipole transitions... Oh right, dipole transitions follow certain selection rules. I remember that for the hydrogen atom, the selection rules are Δl = ±1 and Δm = 0, ±1. But wait, there's more, right? The n can change by any integer, but in practice, it's usually a stepwise change with each transition maybe changing n by one. But wait, in this case, it's going from n=3 to n=1, so two steps. So two transitions: 3 → 2 → 1.

Okay, so the first transition is from n=3, l=0 to n=2. What possible l values can it go to? Since l can change by ±1, from l=0, it can go to l=1. So first transition is |3,0,0> → |2,1,m>, where m can be -1, 0, +1.

Then, from |2,1,m>, the next transition goes to |1,0,0>. So l must decrease by 1 again. Because from l=1, it can go to l=0. So the second transition is |2,1,m> → |1,0,0>.

Wait, but m has to change by 0, ±1. So in the first transition from |3,0,0>, m is 0. So the next state's m can be -1, 0, +1. Then, when transitioning from |2,1, m> to |1,0,0>, the m must go from whatever it was to 0. So the allowed Δm for each step is 0, ±1.

So let's consider the possible paths. The first transition from |3,0,0> to |2,1, m1>, where m1 can be -1, 0, or +1.

Then from |2,1, m1>, it goes to |1,0,0>. So m1 must go to 0. So what are the possible m1 values that can transition to
