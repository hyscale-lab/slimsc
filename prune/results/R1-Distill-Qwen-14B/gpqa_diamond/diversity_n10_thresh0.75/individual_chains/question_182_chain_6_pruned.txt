Okay, so I need to figure out which statement is true about the validity of the Mott-Gurney equation. Hmm, I remember that the Mott-Gurney equation is related to the current-voltage characteristics of semiconductor devices, specifically in the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) regime. 

The equation given is J = (9/8) * ε * μ * (V^2)/(L^3). I think ε is the permittivity (dielectric constant), μ is the carrier mobility, and L is some length, maybe the thickness of the device.

Wait, I remember that in the SCLC region, the current is limited by the space charge effects. So the electric field isn't uniform because the charge builds up, creating a nonlinear voltage profile. The Mott-Gurney equation comes into play here, right?

Now, considering the options. The equation is applicable under certain conditions. Let me think about each option.

Option A: Trap-free single-carrier device with Ohmic contact and negligible drift current. Ohmic contact implies that the contact doesn't cause any barrier for carriers. But wait, if it's an Ohmic contact, does that affect the current in a way that the Mott-Gurney equation still holds? Also, negligible drift current—wait, in SCLC, isn't the current dominated by drift? Because it's space-charge limited, so maybe drift is significant. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here.

Option B: Trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier and negligible diffusion current. No injection barrier—like an Ohmic contact again. And negligible diffusion current. So, if diffusion is negligible, then current is mainly drift. That makes sense because in SCLC, drift is dominant. Also, single-carrier implies only electrons or holes, not both. So this seems plausible.

Option C: Single-carrier with Schottky contact and negligible diffusion. Schottky contact implies a barrier, but in Mott-Gurney, do we need a particular type of contact? I think Mott-Gurney doesn't depend on the contact type as long as the space-charge condition is met. But I'm not sure. Also, Schottky might introduce some barrier, but I'm not certain if that affects the equation's validity. But if the contact is Schottky, then maybe there's a potential barrier for carriers, which could affect the current flow. Oh wait, but Mott-Gurney is more about the bulk behavior, not the contact. So maybe the specific contact type isn't the main factor. But the equation is for single-carrier, so that part matches. The other condition is negligible diffusion current, which aligns with the SCLC regime.

Option D: Two-carrier device with Ohmic contact and negligible diffusion current. Two-carrier devices (like both electrons and holes) usually follow a different model, like the Fowler-Nordheim equation for tunneling, or maybe the Mott-Gurney applies only to single-carrier. So probably D is incorrect because Mott-Gurney is for single-carrier.

So focusing on whether the equation requires single-carrier. I think the Mott-Gurney equation applies to single-carrier devices because when both carriers are present, it's harder to model, and other effects come into play. So
