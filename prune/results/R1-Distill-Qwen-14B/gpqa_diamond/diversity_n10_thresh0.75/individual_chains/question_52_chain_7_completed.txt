Alright, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with all the concepts, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

Okay, let's read the question again. So, there's this star with certain characteristics. Its radius is 1.5 solar radii and mass is 1.1 solar masses. Without spots, the effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by dark spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. The question is about the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels. When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. I need to find the factor by which the ratio changes—so when there are no spots, the ratio is higher, and when there are spots, it's lower.

Hmm, I remember that in stellar atmospheres, the ionization and excitation of atoms depend on temperature. Also, the ratio of populations in two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann equation. The Boltzmann distribution says that the ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels is proportional to (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k*T) ), where g is the statistical weight, E is energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is temperature.

Wait, but the problem says that when the star has spots, the overall Teff is lower. So the effective temperature of the photosphere is lower when spots are present. Spots are cooler regions, right? Because they're dark, so they absorb less light and are probably emitting less, hence lower temperature.

So in this scenario, when there are spots, the average Teff of the star's photosphere decreases. But wait, the star's surface isn't uniformly at 5500 K. Only 40% is covered by spots, which are cooler, and the rest is at 6000 K. But the overall calculation is probably done by considering the flux from each part. Hmm, but maybe for the purpose of this problem, we can approximate that the effective temperature is the average, but that might not be the right approach. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simplified by considering the overall Teff as 5500 K when spots are present, and 6000 K otherwise.

The question is about the ratio of Ti atoms in two energy levels. The ratio is given as (n1)/(n2), or (n2)/(n1)? Wait, the problem says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So, when spots are present, the ratio is lower. So, if the ratio is n1/n2, it's lower when spots are present, implying that n1 is lower relative to n2 when T is lower.

Wait, let me think about how the ratio depends on temperature. The Boltzmann equation for two levels is:

n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k*T) )

Assuming E2 > E1, so (E2-E1) is positive. So, when T decreases, the exponent becomes more negative, making the exponential term smaller. So n2/n1 decreases as T decreases. Therefore, the ratio n2/n1 is lower when T is lower. So if the overall T drops, the ratio n2/n1 would decrease. But the problem says the observed ratio (of n1/n2 or n2/n1?) decreases. Wait, the question says the ratio of the number of neutral Ti in level 1 and level 2 decreases when the star has spots.

Wait, the wording is a bit unclear. Let me read again: "the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energetic levels (level 1 and level 2) decreases when the star has spots." So, when spots are present, the ratio (n1/n2) is lower than when spots are absent.

Wait, but according to the Boltzmann equation, n2/n1 = (g2/g1) exp( -(E2-E1)/(kT) ). So, higher T would make exp( ... ) larger, so n2/n1 increases with T. Therefore, when T is lower (due to spots), n2/n1 decreases. So if the ratio being discussed is n2/n1, then when T decreases, the ratio decreases. So if the ratio decreases when spots are present, then the ratio being discussed is n2/n1. So the problem says the ratio decreases when spots are present. Therefore, when the star has spots, the ratio (n2/n1) is lower. So when the star doesn't have spots, the ratio is higher. So the factor is (ratio without spots)/(ratio with spots) = [ (n2/n1)_no_spots ] / [ (n2/n1)_spots ]

So to find the factor, I need to compute ( (n2/n1)_6000 / (n2/n1)_5500 )

But wait, the problem says that when the star has spots, the overall photospheric Teff is 5500 K. Does that mean that each point on the photosphere is at 5500 K? No, because the spots are cooler, but other regions are at 6000 K. So perhaps the effective temperature is the sum of the fluxes from each region.

Wait, but the problem is about the photosphere. The photosphere's effective temperature would depend on the combined emission from the spotted and unspotted regions. So perhaps the overall Teff is 5500 K when 40% is covered by spots. Wait, but the Teff is a measure of the total luminosity. The star's luminosity when spotted would be the sum of the luminosity from the spotted and unspotted parts.

Wait, but the star's overall Teff is given as 5500 K when 40% is covered. So perhaps the entire photosphere's average temperature is 5500 K. But that doesn't make sense because the spots are cooler. Alternatively, perhaps when 40% is covered, the average flux is such that the overall Teff is 5500 K. 

Wait, the effective temperature is defined by the total luminosity and radius. Luminosity L is 4πR² σ Teff^4. So when the star's surface has spots, the total luminosity is L = (1 - 0.4)*L_spot_region + 0.4*L_unspotted. Wait no, wait—when 40% is covered by spots, the total emitted flux is the sum from the spotted and unspotted regions.

Wait, let's model each part. Let's say the star has a total surface area A. 40% (0.4) of A is covered by spots, which have lower temperature T_spot, and 60% (0.6) is at T_unspotted = 6000 K.

The total luminosity is L = L_spot + L_unspotted.

L_spot is 0.4 * A * σ T_spot^4, and L_unspotted is 0.6 * A * σ (6000)^4.

The effective temperature T_eff is given by:

L = 4 π R^2 σ T_eff^4.

So,

4 π R^2 σ T_eff^4 = 0.4 A σ T_spot^4 + 0.6 A σ (6000)^4.

But wait, the area A for a star is 4 π R^2. Because the surface area of a sphere is 4 π R². So A = 4 π R².

So substituting,

4 π R^2 σ T_eff^4 = 0.4 (4 π R²) σ T_spot^4 + 0.6 (4 π R²) σ (6000)^4.

We can cancel out 4 π R² σ from both sides:

T_eff^4 = 0.4 T_spot^4 + 0.6 (6000)^4.

But the problem states that when 40% is covered, T_eff is 5500 K. So,

5500^4 = 0.4 T_spot^4 + 0.6 * 6000^4.

Wait, but I don't think we need to find T_spot because the problem is about the photosphere as a whole. So when the star has spots, the photosphere's effective temperature is 5500 K, so when considering the overall photosphere, the temperature is 5500 K. So perhaps for the purpose of this problem, the relevant temperature is 5500 K when there are spots, and 6000 K when there are none.

Wait, the problem says, "the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500 K." So perhaps the entire photosphere is at 5500 K when spots are present, but that can't be right because spots are cooler. Hmm, maybe they're averaging the temperature. But perhaps the problem simplifies it and says that the photosphere's effective temperature is 5500 K when spots are present, and 6000 K otherwise. So when computing the ratio, we can use these two temperatures.

Ah, because the problem states that in the stellar photosphere, when examining the ratio, the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So perhaps the photospheric temperature is lower when spots are present.

So, going back to the Boltzmann equation. The ratio is (n1/n2) or (n2/n1)? Let me clarify. The problem says the "ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energetic levels (level 1 and level 2)" decreases when spots are present. So when the star has spots, the ratio (n1/n2) is lower. Or is it (n2/n1) that's lower?

Wait, the ratio is between level 1 and level 2. Let's say the ratio is n1/n2. If that ratio decreases when the star has spots, then when T is lower (with spots), n1 is lower relative to n2. Or maybe when the temperature is lower, the ratio n1/n2 goes down. Hmm.

Wait, according to the Boltzmann equation, n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2-E1)/(kT) )

If E2 > E1, which is typical for higher energy levels, then (E2-E1) is positive. So the exponent is negative, and as T decreases, the exponential term gets smaller. So n2/n1 decreases when T decreases.

So if the ratio n2/n1 is lower when T is low (when spots are present), then the ratio n2/n1 is the one that's decreasing. But the problem says the ratio of level 1 to level 2 (n1/n2) decreases. Wait, if n2/n1 decreases, that would mean n1/n2 increases, since (n1/n2) = 1/(n2/n1). So that's confusing.

Wait, let's clarify. Suppose initially, without spots, the ratio n1/n2 is R1. When spots are present, the same ratio is R2. The problem says R2 < R1, so the ratio decreases.

But according to the Boltzmann equation, when T decreases, n2/n1 decreases, so (n2/n1)_T_low < (n2/n1)_T_high. So (n2/n1) is lower when T is lower.

If the ratio n1/n2 is being discussed, which is 1/(n2/n1), then when T is lower, n2/n1 is lower, so n1/n2 would be higher. That contradicts the problem statement which says the ratio decreases when spots are present.

Wait, that's a problem. So if the ratio of n1/n2 is decreasing when T is lower, that would imply that when T decreases, n1/n2 decreases. But according to the Boltzmann equation, (n2/n1) = (g2/g1) exp( -(E2-E1)/(kT) ). So when T decreases, exp(...) decreases, so (n2/n1) decreases. Therefore, (n1/n2) = 1/(n2/n1) would increase as T decreases.

But the problem says the ratio (n1/n2) decreases when spots are present. So this suggests that when T decreases, n1/n2 decreases. That would mean that (n2/n1) increases when T decreases, which contradicts the Boltzmann equation. Hmm, maybe I got the levels reversed.

Alternatively, perhaps E2 is lower than E1? Wait, that doesn't make sense because level 2 is the higher level. So E2 > E1.

Wait, maybe the ratio being considered is (n2/n1), and the problem states that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when the star has spots, T is lower, so (n2/n1) is lower. That makes sense. Then, the problem's wording might have been (n2/n1) is the ratio, but the question says the ratio of level 1 and level 2, which could be either way.

Wait, the question says, "the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energetic levels (level 1 and level 2)", so that could be either n1/n2 or n2/n1. But the problem says that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. So if the ratio is (n2/n1), then it's correct that when T decreases, (n2/n1) decreases. So the ratio decreases when T is lower.

So for the purposes of this problem, the relevant ratio is n2/n1, which decreases when T decreases. Therefore, when spots are present, n2/n1 is lower, so the factor is (n2/n1)_6000 / (n2/n1)_5500.

Wait, no: the problem says when there are spots, the ratio is lower. So when T is lower, the ratio (n2/n1) is lower. So when T is 6000 K (no spots), the ratio is higher. So the factor is (n2/n1)_6000 divided by (n2/n1)_5500.

So the factor is [ (g2/g1) exp( -(E2-E1)/(k*6000) ) ] / [ (g2/g1) exp( -(E2-E1)/(k*5500) ) ]

Simplify this: the (g2/g1) terms cancel out, so we have exp( [ -(E2-E1)/(k*6000) + (E2-E1)/(k*5500) } )

Factor out (E2-E1)/(k):

= exp( (E2-E1)/(k) [ 1/5500 - 1/6000 ] )

Compute the exponent:

Let me compute 1/5500 - 1/6000.

1/5500 ≈ 0.000181818

1/6000 ≈ 0.000166667

Difference is approximately 0.000015151.

So the exponent becomes (E2-E1)/(k) * 0.000015151.

But wait, what's (E2-E1)? The energy difference corresponds to a wavelength of 1448 Å. So we can compute the energy using the relation E = hc/λ.

h is Planck's constant, 6.626e-34 J·s.

c is speed of light, 3e8 m/s.

λ is 1448 Å, which is 1448e-10 meters.

So E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1448e-10) 

Wait, let's compute that:

E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1.448e-7) )

Compute numerator: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Denominator: 1.448e-7 m.

So E = 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 = approximately 1.373e-18 J per photon.

Wait, but since this is per photon, and the energy levels are per atom, but in the Boltzmann equation, we use energy in units of J multiplied by Avogadro's number for molar calculations? Or perhaps we can compute the term (E2-E1)/(k T) directly.

But in the exponent, (E2-E1) is hc/λ, so let's compute (E2-E1)/(k T) for each temperature.

Alternatively, since the exponent is (E2-E1)/(k) * (1/5500 - 1/6000), let me compute the factor inside the exponential.

But perhaps a better approach is to compute the ratio of the Boltzmann factors.

Wait, let's think in terms of the ratio. The factor is exp( (E2-E1)/(k) (1/(5500) - 1/(6000)) )

But (E2-E1) = hc/λ, so:

= exp( (hc)/(k λ) (1/5500 - 1/6000) )

Let me compute (1/5500 - 1/6000) in units of 1/K.

1/5500 ≈ 0.000181818 K^-1.

1/6000 ≈ 0.000166667 K^-1.

Difference ≈ 0.000015151 K^-1.

Compute (hc)/(k λ):

h = 6.626e-34 J·s

c = 3e8 m/s

k = 1.38e-23 J/K

λ = 1448e-10 m

Compute hc/(k λ):

(6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1.38e-23 * 1448e-10 )

Let me compute numerator: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Denominator: 1.38e-23 *1.448e-7 = 1.38e-23 * 1.448e-7 = (1.38 * 1.448) * 1e-30 ≈ 1.999e-30 J·m.

So hc/(k λ) = (1.9878e-25) / (1.999e-30) ≈ 1e5.

Wait, 1.9878e-25 / 1.999e-30 = approximately 1e5 (since 1e-25 / 1e-30 = 1e5). Let me compute more accurately:

1.9878e-25 / 1.999e-30 = (1.9878 / 1.999) * 1e5 ≈ (0.994) * 1e5 ≈ 9.94e4 ≈ 1e5.

So approximately, hc/(k λ) ≈ 1e5 K.

Wait, that makes sense because hc/(k λ) is about the typical excitation temperature scale. For visible wavelengths, it's around 10^4 to 1e5 K.

So now, the exponent is (1e5 K) * (0.000015151 K^-1) ≈ 1.5151.

So the exponent is approximately 1.5151.

So the factor is exp(1.5151) ≈ e^1.5151 ≈ 4.55.

Wait, e^1 is about 2.718, e^1.6 is ~4.953, e^1.5 is about 4.4817. So 1.5151 is a bit less than 1.5, so e^1.5151 would be around 4.53 or so.

So the factor is approximately 4.5, which is option C.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation.

Wait, the exponent came from (E2-E1)/(k T) for each temperature, but perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute (E2-E1)/(k T) for each temperature and then compute the ratio.

Let me try that approach.

Compute (E2-E1)/(k T) for T = 6000 K and T =5500 K.

E = hc/λ = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1448e-10) = 1.373e-18 J.

k = 1.38e-23 J/K.

For T =6000 K:

(E)/(k T) = (1.373e-18) / (1.38e-23 *6000) 

Denominator: 1.38e-23 *6e3 = 8.28e-20.

So (1.373e-18) / (8.28e-20) = approx 16.58.

Similarly, for T=5500 K:

E/(k T) = 1.373e-18 / (1.38e-23 *5500) 

Denominator: 1.38e-23 *5.5e3 =7.59e-20.

So 1.373e-18 / 7.59e-20 = approx 18.08.

Wait, wait. That can't be right. Because the denominator is smaller at lower T, so the value would be higher. So for T=6000 K, E/(kT)= ~16.58, and for T=5500 K, E/(kT)= ~18.08.

Then, the ratio n2/n1 = (g2/g1) exp( - E/(kT) )

So the ratio without spots (T=6000) is (g2/g1) exp(-16.58), and with spots (T=5500) it's (g2/g1) exp(-18.08).

So the factor is [exp(-16.58)] / [exp(-18.08)] = exp(18.08 -16.58) = exp(1.5) ≈ 4.48.

Which is approximately 4.5, matching option C.

So the factor by which the ratio (n2/n1) changes is about 4.5. So when the star doesn't have spots, the ratio is higher by a factor of about 4.5 compared to when it has spots.


To determine the factor by which the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots, we use the Boltzmann equation:

\[
\frac{n_2}{n_1} = \frac{g_2}{g_1} \exp\left(-\frac{E_2 - E_1}{kT}\right)
\]

Here, \(n_2\) and \(n_1\) are the populations of the two energy levels, \(g_2\) and \(g_1\) are their statistical weights, \(E_2 - E_1\) is the energy difference between the levels, \(k\) is Boltzmann's constant, and \(T\) is the temperature.

### Key Information:
1. The star's effective temperature (\(T_{\text{eff}}\)) is 6000 K without spots and 5500 K with spots.
2. The energy difference between the two levels corresponds to a wavelength of 1448 Å, so:
   \[
   E_2 - E_1 = \frac{hc}{\lambda}
   \]
   where \(h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}\), \(c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}\), and \(\lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å} = 1.448 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m}\).

3. The ratio of the number of atoms in the two levels depends on the temperature. When the star has spots, the overall \(T_{\text{eff}}\) decreases, causing the ratio to decrease.

### Calculation:
The factor by which the ratio changes is given by:
\[
\text{Factor} = \frac{\left(\frac{n_2}{n_1}\right)_{T=6000}}{\left(\frac{n_2}{n_1}\right)_{T=5500}}
\]

Using the Boltzmann equation, this becomes:
\[
\text{Factor} = \frac{\exp\left(-\frac{E_2 - E_1}{k \cdot 6000}\right)}{\exp\left(-\frac{E_2 - E_1}{k \cdot 5500}\right)} = \exp\left(\frac{E_2 - E_1}{k} \left(\frac{1}{5500} - \frac{1}{6000}\right)\right)
\]

#### Step 1: Compute \(E_2 - E_1\)
\[
E_2 - E_1 = \frac{hc}{\lambda} = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3 \times 10^8)}{1.448 \times 10^{-7}} \approx 1.373 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J}
\]

#### Step 2: Compute \(\frac{E_2 - E_1}{k}\)
\[
\frac{E_2 - E_1}{k} = \frac{1.373 \times 10^{-18}}{1.38 \times 10^{-23}} \approx 9940 \, \text{K}
\]

#### Step 3: Compute \(\frac{1}{5500} - \frac{1}{6000}\)
\[
\frac{1}{5500} - \frac{1}{6000} = 0.0001818 - 0.0001667 \approx 0.0000151 \, \text{K}^{-1}
\]

#### Step 4: Compute the exponent
\[
\text{Exponent} = \frac{E_2 - E_1}{k} \left(\frac{1}{5500} - \frac{1}{6000}\right) = 9940 \cdot 0.0000151 \approx 0.15
\]

#### Step 5: Compute the factor
\[
\text{Factor} = \exp(0.15) \approx 1.16
\]

### Conclusion:
The factor by which the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in the two energy levels changes is approximately **1.16**.

ANSWER: A
