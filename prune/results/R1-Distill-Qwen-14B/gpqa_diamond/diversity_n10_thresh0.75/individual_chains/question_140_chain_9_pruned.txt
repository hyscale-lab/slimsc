Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this chemistry problem. Let me read it again and break it down step by step.

The question is about a substance X that reacts with liquid Y violently, releasing a gas W. The gas W has a molecule where the number of neutrons equals the number of protons. Then a precipitate G forms, which when heated releases B. B's melting point is near 277 K, which is about 4Â°C. 

The product of a certain keto acid reacting with X contains 2 oxygen atoms. X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, especially its analogs. I'm supposed to find the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X.

Hmm, let's think about each part. First, let's figure out what each substance might be.

Starting with the reaction between X and Y. The reaction is violent, which makes me think of something reactive like a metal reacting with an acid. Y is a liquid, so maybe it's an acid like H2SO4 or HCl, but wait, HCl is a liquid at room temp? No, it's a gas. So perhaps Y is sulfuric acid, which is a liquid when concentrated. Or maybe something else.

When they react, they release gas W, which has equal protons and neutrons. The molecule of W has same number of protons and neutrons. So, the molecular weight of W would be (protons + neutrons) per atom multiplied by the number of atoms. Wait, but they say the molecule has same number of protons and neutrons. So, if it's a diatomic molecule, for example, each atom has same number of p and n.

Wait, but the molecule's protons and neutrons are the same in count. Let me think of possible gases. For example, O2: each O has 8 protons. Neutrons in O can vary; but in O2, each O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons (if it's O-16). So each O has 8n and 8p. So O2 has 16p and 16n. So the molecule's protons and neutrons are same. That might fit.

Another possibility is H2, but H has 1p and 0n (since protium has no neutrons). So that doesn't fit. Or maybe NH3, but that's a gas but not sure. Alternatively, maybe CO
