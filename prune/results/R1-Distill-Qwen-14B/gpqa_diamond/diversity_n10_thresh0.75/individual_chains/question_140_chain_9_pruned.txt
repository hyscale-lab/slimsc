Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and try to understand the clues.

The question is about a substance X reacting with liquid Y. The reaction releases a gas W whose molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. Then a precipitate G forms, which when heated releases B. The melting point of B is close to 277 K. Also, the product of a keto acid with X has 2 oxygen atoms. Additionally, X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, especially its analog.

Hmm. I'll start by breaking down each part.

First, the reaction of X with Y. Gas W has the same number of neutrons and protons. So, each W molecule has equal neutrons and protons. That makes me think of a molecule where each atom has that property. Wait, but wait, W is a gas, so maybe it's something like H2O or CO2, but wait, H2O has H (1p, 0n) and O (8p, 8n). So each H has 1p, 0n. So for H2O, each molecule has 2 H and 1 O. So each H has p=1, n=0. O has p=8, n=8. So in H2O, each H contributes 1p, 0n, and O 8p,8n. So per molecule, total p is 2*(1) +8=10, n is 2*(0)+8=8. But the question says the molecule has same number of neutrons and protons. Wait, for H2O, total protons is 2+8=10, total neutrons is (0*2) +8=8. So 10 vs 8, not equal. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe W is a molecule where each atom has p = n. Like, for example, carbon-12 has 6p,6n. So a molecule could be something like CO2. Let's see: C has 6p,6n; each O has 8p,8n. So per CO2 molecule, p=6 + 2*8=22; n=6 + 2*8=22. Oh, that works! So W is CO2. Because then each molecule, protons and neutrons sum up equally. So the gas is carbon dioxide.

Wait, but what's another possibility? Helium is a noble gas, but He is monoatomic. He has 2p, 2n (since it's helium-4, the most common isotope). So each He atom has p=2, n=2. So if W were He, that's also a monoatomic gas with p=n=2. But the question says "the molecule" has same number of neutrons and protons. So if W is He, each atom (molecule) has p=2, n=2. So that also fits. But which one is more likely?

Another possibility is CH4. C has 6p,6n; H has 1p,0n. So per CH
