Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this physics problem. Hmm, let me read it again. So there are two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m moving at relativistic speeds of 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. The question is about their relative speed and the total energy of the system. The options are given as A, B, C, D. 

Right, so I remember that when dealing with velocities in relativity, you can't just subtract them normally because velocities don't add linearly when they're a significant fraction of the speed of light. Oh wait, right, the formula for adding velocities relativistically is v = (u + v)/(1 + (uv)/c²). But wait, this is for when you're moving at velocity u and you observe another object moving at velocity v. So in this case, the relative speed would be the velocity of one astronaut as seen from the other's frame.

Wait, but wait. Wait, the first astronaut is moving at 0.6c, and the second at 0.5c. So the relative speed would be the difference between these, but using the relativistic formula. Let me think. So if astronaut A is in the first spaceship moving at 0.6c, and astronaut B is moving at 0.5c in the same direction, from A's frame, B's speed is (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c²). Wait, that would be negative, but since I'm taking the magnitude for speed, maybe just the absolute value.

Wait, no. Let me get the formula correctly. The relative velocity formula is (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)), where u is the speed of one object and v is the speed of the other as seen from the first. So in this case, the problem is, which astronaut's frame are we considering? Since both are moving in the same direction, the relative speed would be the difference, but adjusted relativistically.

Wait, astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, astronaut B at 0.5c. So from A's perspective, B is moving at (0.5c - 0.6c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)) = (-0.1c) / (1 - 0.3) = (-0.1c)/(0.7) ≈ -0.1
