Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the decay of a boson. Let me try to understand what's going on. The question gives me a Lagrangian term and some options about the possible decay channels of the boson X.

First, the Lagrangian is given as L(y) = -λf f-bar ψ(y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, wait, maybe that's a typo in the way it's written. Let me parse that. Oh, wait, maybe it's supposed to be something like L(y) = -λ f ψ_f(y) (ῡ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, no, perhaps it's a Yukawa coupling term. The standard Yukawa interaction is something like L = g ψ ψ X, but with fermion fields. So here, maybe the interaction is between the boson X and fermions ψ. 

The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV, so I need to find which fermions can be produced in pairs via this decay. Since X is a boson, it can decay into two fermions because bosons can have integer spin, but for decay into fermions, you need a vector or scalar coupling.

Wait, in particle physics, for a boson to decay into two fermions, the fermions must be a pair of matter and antimatter, because each fermion has a spin-1/2. So the decay products must be a particle and antiparticle pair. So X → f f-bar.

But what determines which fermions can be produced? It's the mass of X compared to the mass of the fermions. Because the rest mass of X (6 GeV) must be at least twice the mass of the fermion to allow decay into that pair. So for each possible fermion, I need to check if 2*m_fermion ≤ 6 GeV.

So the fermions are probably quarks and leptons. Let me list the masses of the known fermions. 

For quarks, the masses are approximately (but note that masses vary depending on the energy scale and the type of quark):

- Up and down: about 2-5 MeV each (so 2m ~ 4-10 MeV << 6 GeV)
- Strange: around 100 MeV (so 2m ~ 200 MeV <<6 GeV)
- Charm: around 1.5 GeV (so 2m ≈3 GeV <6 GeV)
- Bottom: around 4.5 GeV (so 2m ≈9 GeV >6 GeV → can't decay into b b-bar)
- Top: way too heavy, 173 GeV, so no way.

For leptons:

- Electron: ~0.0005 GeV. 2m is negligible.
- Muon: ~0.1 GeV. 2m ~0.2 GeV <6 GeV.
- Tau: ~1.77 GeV. 2m ~3.54 GeV <6 GeV.
- Neutrinos: mass is negligible.

So, X can't decay into
