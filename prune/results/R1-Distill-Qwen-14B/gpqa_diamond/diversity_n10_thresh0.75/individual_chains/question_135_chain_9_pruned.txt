Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a boson. Let me try to figure this out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll take it slow.

The question gives me a Lagrangian interaction term: L(y) = -λf ψ_f(y) (ῡ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, I think this is the interaction between the boson X and some fermions. Wait, the notation might be a bit confusing. Let me parse it. Oh, right, the term probably involves the field X interacting with fermion fields ψ_f. The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV, and the question is about its possible decay channels at the lowest order.

So, the boson X can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs. But what fermions are available? The decay products have to have a combined mass less than the mass of X, I think. Because in particle physics, for a particle to decay into two particles, their rest masses must add up to less than the mass of the original.

Wait, but wait! The boson is a spin-0 particle, so when it decays, it would produce a fermion and its antiparticle. So the decay products must be a pair of fermions (like quarks, leptons, etc.).

So the possible decays would be X → f f̄, where f is a fermion. But for each possible fermion pair, their mass has to be less than or equal to the mass of X. But wait, the mass of X is 6 GeV.

I should list all possible fermions and their masses to see which can pair up to a combined mass less than or equal to 6 GeV. But wait, the masses are for individual fermions, right? So each pair would contribute 2m_f, because each fermion has mass m_f. So 2m_f must be ≤ 6 GeV.

Wait, no, not exactly. Because when the boson is at rest, the total energy available is its mass energy, which is 6 GeV. So the sum of the rest masses of the decay products must be less than or equal to 6 GeV. So for each fermion species, 2m_f ≤ 6 GeV → m_f ≤ 3 GeV. Because each f has mass m_f, and you have f and f̄, so 2m_f.

So which fermions have m_f ≤ 3 GeV?

Let me think about the masses of the known fermions.

Leptons: electrons (m ~ 0.0005 GeV), muons (m ~ 0.105 GeV), taus (m ~1.78 GeV), and neutrinos (masses are tiny, but maybe negligible). So for leptons, the tau has m ~1.78 GeV, so 2m would be ~3.56 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV. Wait, wait, 1.78*2=3.56 <6. So tau pair is allowed. But wait, the tau is 1.78 GeV, so 2m =3.56 GeV <6 GeV. So that's okay.

Wait, but wait, the X is 6 GeV. So for any pair, 2m_f ≤6 GeV → m_f ≤3 GeV. So let me list fermions with m_f ≤3 GeV.

Quarks: up, down, strange, charm, bottom, top. Wait, but the top quark is really heavy, around 173 GeV, so way above 3 GeV. So top is out. Bottom quark is about 4.7 GeV, so 2m = ~9.4 GeV, which is way more than 6 GeV. So bottom quark can't be decay products because 2m_b is 9.4 GeV, which is larger than 6 GeV.
