Hmm, okay, so I've got this question about planets and their transit probabilities. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of the concepts, but I'll try my best.

So, the question is about two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. The researchers want to observe the one with the highest probability of transiting because they have limited time. Both planets have been detected via the radial velocity (RV) method, which gives their minimum masses and orbital periods. 

Wait, the RV method gives the minimum mass because it depends on the velocity along our line of sight. But in this case, since both planets have the same masses, that's given. But their orbital periods are different. Planet_1's period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. So, Planet_1 is closer to its star since a shorter orbital period usually means a closer orbit, assuming the same star.

The stars they're orbiting have the same radii. The host of Planet_1 has twice the mass of Planet_2's host. Wait, but same radii. Hmm, that's interesting because more massive stars are usually larger, but maybe these are in different stages. Wait, the host of Planet_2 is slightly evolved, so perhaps it's a subgiant or something, but same radius as Planet_1's host. So, maybe Planet_1's star is a main-sequence star with higher mass, but same radius as the evolved star of Planet_2. Interesting.

The question is about transit probability. Transit probability depends on the size of the planet relative to the star, and the alignment of the orbit relative to our line of sight. I remember that the probability of a transit is roughly proportional to (R_planet / R_star)^2, or maybe the ratio of the planet's orbital size relative to the star's radius? Wait, no, wait. The transit probability P is given by the formula P = (R_p / a) / (1 + (R_p / a)), but wait, I might be mixing things up.

Wait, another approach. The transit probability is the probability that the planet's orbit, as seen from Earth, is aligned such that it passes in front of the star. For a circular orbit, the probability is proportional to (R_p + R_star) / a, but wait, no. Let me think again. The formula I think is P = (R_star + R_planet) / a
