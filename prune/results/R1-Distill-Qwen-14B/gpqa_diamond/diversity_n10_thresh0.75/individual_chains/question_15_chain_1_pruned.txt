Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and their transit probabilities. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

So, the setup is that there are two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. The researchers want to observe the one with the highest chance of transiting because they have limited time. Both were detected via the radial velocity (RV) method, which tells us their minimum masses and orbital periods.

Wait, both have the same mass. Oh, but Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. So Planet_1 is closer to its star, right? Because shorter period means it's orbiting faster and closer. Kepler's third law, I think.

The stars: Planet_1's host is more massive. It's twice the mass of Planet_2's host. But both stars have the same radii. Interesting, so even though Planet_1's star is more massive, it's not larger in radius. Hmm, maybe it's a subgiant or something, but anyway, same radius matters for the transit probability.

So transit probability depends on a few factors. I remember the formula for transit probability involves the size of the planet and the star, and the orbital distance. Oh right, the formula is P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / a), where a is the semi-major axis. Wait, or is it more complicated than that? I think it's also related to the alignment of the orbit with our line of sight, but since we're looking for the highest probability, we can assume that other factors are equal except for the planetary and orbital characteristics.

Wait, but the formula I remember is P = R_p^2 / (R_s (a))². No, wait, maybe I'm mixing it up. Let me think again. The transit probability is the ratio of the area of the planet's disk to that of the star, multiplied by the likelihood that the orbital plane is aligned such that the planet passes in front of the star. For circular orbits, the probability is roughly (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by the probability that the inclination is just right. The exact calculation might also involve the distance, but I think the main factors are the planet's size relative to the star and the orbital distance.

Wait, actually, the precise formula for the transit probability (the chance that the planet transits) is given by (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / a) * something else? Or perhaps it's (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by another factor.

Wait, no. Let me get this straight. The transit probability, for a randomly oriented orbit, is approximately (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (a (1 - e²)^0.5)) ), but since both orbits are circular (e=0), it simplifies. But wait, also, the probability depends on the size of the star and the planet's orbital distance. Alternatively, another way to think about it is that the transit probability is proportional to the area of the planet relative to the star, but also depends on the orbital distance—specifically, the probability is higher when the orbital distance is smaller, because the planet is moving faster and has a higher chance of crossing our line of sight.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to recall. The transit probability P is given by (
