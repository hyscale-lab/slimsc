Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about calculating the enthalpy of formation of a specific organic compound. The compound given is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. That looks pretty complex, so I need to figure out the structure first.

Wait, the formula is a bit long. Let me try to parse it. It's (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. Hmm, so I think it's a molecule with two double bonds. Let me draw it out mentally. Each (CH3)2C= part suggests a substituent with two methyl groups attached to a carbon that's part of a double bond. So maybe it's a diene with two substituents on each double bond.

But wait, the question isn't directly about the structure; it's about the enthalpy of formation. Oh right, the enthalpy of formation is the change in enthalpy when a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. The formula for calculating this using bond energies is: 

ΔHf° = [sum of bond energies of all bonds broken] - [sum of bond energies of all bonds formed]

But wait, I remember another approach: the enthalpy of formation can be calculated using the atomization approach. The formula is:

ΔHf = (sum of enthalpies of atomization of elements) - (sum of bond energies in the compound)

Wait, no, that might not be right. Let me think again. The enthalpy of formation is calculated by taking the enthalpy required to break all bonds in the reactants (elements) and subtract the energy released when forming bonds in the products. So the general formula is:

ΔHf° = Σ (atoms' atomization energies) - Σ (bond energies in the molecule)

Wait, no, another way to think about it. The enthalpy of formation is the energy required to build the molecule from its constituent atoms. So it's the sum of the energies needed to break all the bonds in the elements (which are in their standard forms, like O2, N2, etc.) minus the energies released when forming the bonds in the target molecule.

But in this problem, the given data doesn't include the enthalpies of atomization for H or C. Wait, no, the question gives the enthalpy of atomization of carbon as 1000 kJ/mol. Oh, wait, atomization energy or enthalpy of atomization is the energy required to break a bond in an element to form gaseous atoms. So for C, it's 1000 kJ/mol.

But how does that tie into the enthalpy of formation? Let me recall. The standard approach is:

Enthalpy of formation (ΔHf°) of a compound is calculated as:

ΔHf° = [Σ (atomization energy of each element) × number of atoms] - [Σ (
