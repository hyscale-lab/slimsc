Okay, so I'm looking at this Lagrangian here: L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. Hmm, I need to find the mass dimension of κ and determine if the theory is renormalizable. Oh right, I remember that the mass dimension of a coupling constant tells us something about whether the theory is renormalizable. Like, if it's positive, maybe the theory isn't renormalizable because higher-order terms would have higher dimensions.

Wait, but wait. Let me take it step by step. First, I need to figure out the dimensions of each term in the Lagrangian. The Lagrangian has to be dimensionless in natural units (since it's integrated over spacetime, which is dimensionless). So each term in the Lagrangian should have mass dimension 4 because the integral is [d^4x], which has dimension -4 (since each x is dimension -1). Wait, no, wait. Wait, the Lagrangian itself is multiplied by d^4x, so the Lagrangian density must have mass dimension 4. Because when you integrate something of dimension 4 over four dimensions (each x is dimension -1, so d^4x is dimension -4), the whole integral is dimensionless.

So each term in the Lagrangian must have dimension 4.

Looking at L_int: the term is κ multiplied by ψ̄, σ_{μν}, ψ, F^{μν}.

Let me recall the mass dimensions of these fields. Fermion fields ψ
