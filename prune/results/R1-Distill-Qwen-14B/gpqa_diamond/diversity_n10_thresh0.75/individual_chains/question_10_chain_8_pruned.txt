Okay, so I have this question about exoplanets and their densities. Hmm, let me try to think through this. The question is asking which of the given options has the highest density. The options are a, b, c, d, each describing a different planet. Let me break them down one by one.

Option a is an Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet. Well, Earth's density is known, right? I think Earth's density is around 5.5 g/cm³ because Earth is made of silicate rocks and metals. So if this planet has the same mass and radius, its density should be the same as Earth's. So that's 5.5 g/cm³.

Option b is a planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³. Wait, if the density is given as 5.5, which is the same as Earth, but it's more massive. But wait, density is mass divided by volume. So if the mass doubles, and the density stays the same, what does that mean for the radius? Let's see. The volume is (4/3)πr³. So if the mass (M) is 2M_earth, and density (ρ) is same as Earth, then M = ρ * V. So V = M/ρ. If M doubles, V also doubles. Volume scales with r³, so doubling volume means radius increases by cube root of 2, which is about 1.26 times Earth's radius. So this planet is bigger than Earth but same density. So density is 5.5.

Option c is a planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive. Since it's same composition, I think its density should be the same as Earth's. Because density depends on composition. So if it's 5 times Earth's mass, but same radius? Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, because density is mass/volume. If the mass increases, but if the radius also increases, how does that affect density.

Wait, same composition implies same density because density depends on what the planet is made of. So if the planet is 5 times Earth's mass but same composition, then its density would still be 5.5 g/cm³. But wait, no, because if the mass increases, but the radius also increases, maybe the density remains the same. So same as Earth. Hmm, so option c's density is same as
