Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out what the compound is based on the spectral data provided. Let me think through this step by step.

First, let's look at the mass spectral data. The molecular ion peak is at m/z=156 with 100% intensity. Then there's a peak at m/z=158 with 32% intensity. Hmm, so the molecular weight is probably 156. The fragment at 158 is a bit higher than the molecular ion. Wait, that's unusual because usually fragments are lighter, so maybe it's a fragment with an addition, like maybe a chlorine or something else. Or perhaps it's an isotope peak? Let me think. Chlorine has a higher atomic weight, so maybe the molecular ion has a Cl in it, and the 158 is the Cl-35 isotope? Wait, but 156 is the molecular ion. Let me calculate the possible molecular formula. If the molecular weight is 156, what could that be? Let's see, C8H5ClO3? Let's check: C is 12, H is 1, Cl is 35.5, O is 16.

Wait, maybe it's better to look at the options. The options are A to D. Let me see each one's molecular weight.

Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. Structure would be benzaldehyde with Cl and OH. The molecular formula would be C7H5ClO2. Let's calculate: 7*12=84, 5*1=5, Cl is ~35.5, O is 16*2=32. Total: 84 +5=89 +35.5=124.5+32=156.5. So that's about 156, which matches the molecular ion. So that's possible.

Option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Structure is benzoic acid with Cl in the para position. Formula is C7H5ClO2. Same as option A. So molecular weight would be same as A, around 156.5.

Option C: Phenyl chloroformate. That's OClCOOPh. Wait, no, phenyl chloroformate is Cl-CO-O-Ph. So formula would be C6H5O2ClCO2? Wait, no, chloroformate is Cl-CO-O-R. So for phenyl, R is benzene. So formula is C6H5O2CClO? Wait, wait, let me do it. Phenyl chloroformate is ClCO-O-C6H5. So the formula would be C7H5ClO2. Wait, same as A and B? Because C6H5 (7 carbons including the oxygen?), wait no. Wait, C6H5 is 6 carbons, O, then COCl? Or maybe I'm mixing up. Let's think: chloroformate group is Cl-CO-O-. So if it's phenyl chloroformate, the structure is O=C(O-Ph)-Cl. So the formula is C6H5O2ClCO? Wait, no, let me count. The benzene is C6H5, then the chloroformate is O2ClC(O). So the molecule is C6H5-O-CO-Cl. So the formula is C7H5ClO2. Wait, no, C6H5 is C6, O, COCl would be another C, O, Cl, and another O. So total C is 7, H is 5, Cl is 1, O is 3? Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me compute it properly. The structure
