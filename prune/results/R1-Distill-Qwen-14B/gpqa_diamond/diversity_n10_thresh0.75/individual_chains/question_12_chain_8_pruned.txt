Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a decay process. The reaction given is Pi(+) → mu(+) + nu. The pion is at rest, and we're given their rest masses: the pion is 139.6 MeV/c² and the muon is 105.7 MeV/c². The options are A, B, C, D with different pairs of energies. Hmm.

First, I remember that when a particle at rest decays into two particles, those two particles must have equal and opposite momenta to conserve momentum. So the total momentum before decay is zero, so after decay, the momenta of the muon and neutrino must cancel each other out.

Next, I think about energy conservation. The total energy before decay is just the rest mass of the pion because it's stationary. So the total energy after decay is the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino. But wait, neutrinos are tricky because they have very tiny mass, almost massless. So for the purpose of this problem, I think we can assume the neutrino's rest mass is zero. That makes things a bit easier.

So the total energy after decay is the sum of the muon's energy (which includes its rest mass and kinetic energy) and the neutrino's energy (which is just its kinetic energy, since its rest mass is negligible). But wait, the neutrino's energy would be its kinetic energy plus any rest mass energy, but if m_nu is zero, then E_nu = K.E.nu. Same for the muon: E_mu = rest mass energy (m_mu c²) plus kinetic energy (K.E_mu).

So let's write the conservation equations. The total energy before decay is m_pi c². After decay, it's E_mu + E_nu = m_mu c² + K_mu + K_nu. But since the neutrino's rest mass is zero, E_nu = K_nu. So the equation becomes:

m_pi c² = m_mu c² + K_mu + K_nu.

Also, from momentum conservation, since the pion is at rest, the momenta of the muon and neutrino must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. So |p_mu| = |p_n
