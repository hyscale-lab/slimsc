Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm, let's see what the question says. The problem states that two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m, moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. We need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. The options are A to D.

Wait, I remember that when dealing with velocities close to the speed of light, we can't just use classical velocity addition. Oh right, Einstein's velocity addition formula comes into play here. So the relative speed isn't simply the difference between their velocities. I think the formula is something like (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/c²), but I'm not totally sure. Let me think: if one object is moving at u and another at v in the same direction, the relative speed would be (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)). Yeah, that sounds right.

So the first astronaut is moving at 0.6c, and the second at 0.5c. Since they're in the same direction, from the perspective of the first astronaut, the second is moving at (0.6c - 0.5c) divided by 1 minus (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²). Let me compute that.

Wait, wait. Wait, wait, no. Wait, no, the first astronaut is moving at 0.6c, and the second at 0.5c. So from the first astronaut's frame, the second is moving at (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)). Let me compute the denominator first. 0.6c * 0.5c is 0.3 c². So denominator becomes 1 - (0.3 c²)/(c²) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. Numerator is 0.1 c. So 0.1c / 0.7. Let me calculate that: 0.1 / 0.7 is approximately 0.142857... So 0.14c. So the relative speed is about 0.14c, right? Wait, or is it the other way around because maybe I got the order mixed up? Because if the first astronaut is moving at 0.6c, and the second at 0
