Okay, so I need to find the mean decay distance of a meson resonance X. Let me think about what I remember from my physics classes. 

The problem gives me the production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. Hmm, right, the mean decay distance usually relates to how long the particle lives before decaying, which depends on its lifetime. 

Wait, right, the mean lifetime τ is related to the width Γ via the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. The uncertainty principle says that ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2. But I think for particle physics, the relation is τ = ħ / Γ. Or wait, maybe Γ is the total decay width, so the lifetime τ is inversely proportional to Γ. So τ ≈ ħ / Γ.

Once I have the lifetime, I can find the mean decay distance by multiplying the velocity of the particle times the lifetime. Because distance is velocity multiplied by time. So the mean decay distance L = βcτ, where β is the velocity in terms of the speed of light, c is the speed of light.

But wait, how do I find β? I need to relate the energy and mass to get the velocity. I remember that the energy of a relativistic particle is E = γ m c², where γ is the Lorentz factor. Also, β = v/c = (pc)/(E), since p = γmv. 

Wait, alternatively, I can use the relation E² = (pc)² + (m c²)². So solving for p, p = sqrt(E² - (m c²)²) / c²? Hmm, maybe I should express everything in terms of natural units first, but I'm not sure. Maybe it's easier to compute the velocity.

Wait, let's think step by step:

1. Calculate the lifetime τ = ħ / Γ. But wait, ħ has units of GeV·s or something. What's the value? I remember that ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. So τ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (320 MeV). Wait, because Γ is in MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. So 320 MeV = 0.32 GeV. So τ = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 ≈ 2.056e-24 seconds.

2. Now, find the velocity β. The particle's energy E is 8 GeV, and its mass is 1.2 GeV. So E = γ m c². So γ = E / (m c²) = 8 / 1.2 ≈ 6.6667 (since m c² is 1.2 GeV). So γ is about 6.6667.

Then, the velocity β is sqrt(1 - 1/γ²). Wait, because β = sqrt(1 - (1/γ²)). Let me calculate 1/γ²: 1/(6.6667)^2 is roughly 1/44.444, which is about 0.0225. So sqrt(1 - 0.0225) = sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887. So β ≈ 0.9887c, but this is an approximation. Alternatively, maybe a more precise calculation is needed.

Alternatively, another approach: The energy E is 8 GeV, so E = γ m c². So γ = E/(m c²) = 8/(1.2) = 6.666666... So, to find β, I can use β = sqrt(1 - (1/γ²)).

Calculating 1/γ²: (1/6.6667)^2 = (0.15)^2 = 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. The square root of that
