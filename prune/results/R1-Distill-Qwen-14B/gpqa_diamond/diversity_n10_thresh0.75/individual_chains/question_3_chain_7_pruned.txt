Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says a spin-half particle is in a linear superposition: 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. These |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz. We're supposed to find the expectation value of the operator 10σz +5σx. The options are given, and I need to pick the right one.

Hmm. I remember that expectation values are calculated using the formula ⟨ψ|O|ψ⟩, where O is the operator. So for each term in the operator, I'll need to compute the expectation value and then combine them.

Wait, the operator is 10σz +5σx. So I can break this down. The expectation of 10σz will be 10 times the expectation of σz, and similarly for σx. So I can compute each part separately and then add them.

First, let's find the expectation of σz. Since |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz, the expectation value should be straightforward. The eigenvalues for σz are +1 for |↑⟩ and -1 for |↓⟩, right?

So the state is ψ = 0.5|↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↓⟩. The coefficients are 0.5 and sqrt(3)/2, respectively.

The expectation value ⟨σz⟩ is the sum of the probabilities multiplied by their respective eigenvalues. So that would be |0.5|^2 * (+1) + |sqrt(3)/2|^2 * (-1).

Calculating each term: |0.5|^2 is 0.25, and |sqrt(3)/2|^2 is (3/4) since (sqrt(3)/2)^2 is 3/4. So 0.25*(1) + (3/4)*(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5. So ⟨σz⟩ is -0.5.

Then, the expectation value for 10σz is 10 * (-0.5) = -5.

Now, the tricky part is calculating the expectation of σx. I remember that σx is the Pauli X matrix, which has eigenstates |+⟩ and |-⟩, which are superpositions of |↑⟩ and |↓⟩. Or wait, maybe another approach is better.

The operator σx has matrix representation [[0, 1], [1, 0]]. So for a state ψ = a|↑⟩ + b|↓⟩, the expectation value ⟨σx⟩ is a*(b^*) + (a^*)(b), because when you compute ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩, you'd have to multiply out the terms.

Wait, let me write it more carefully. Let me represent |↑⟩ as [1, 0]^T and |↓⟩ as [0, 1]^T. So the state ψ is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]^T.

The operator σx is [[0, 1], [1, 0]], so when you compute ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩, it's the same as (0.5, sqrt(3)/2) multiplied by σx multiplied by (0.5, sqrt(3)/2).

Wait, no. Actually, in matrix terms, the expectation value is ψ† σx ψ, where ψ is a column vector. So let's compute that.

So ψ is a column vector [0.5; sqrt(3)/2]. Then, σx ψ is [[0,1],[1,0]] applied to ψ, which would be [sqrt(3)/2; 0.5]. Then, the inner product of ψ with this vector is (0.5)(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)(0.5). 

Wait, let me compute that. So:

ψ† σx ψ = [0.5, sqrt(3)/2] * [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5]^T.

So that's (0.5 * sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2 * 0.5) = (sqrt(3)/4) + (sqrt(3)/4) = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660...

So ⟨σx⟩ is approximately 0.8660. Then, 5σx's expectation is 5 * 0.866 ≈ 4.33.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check the calculation. Another way is to compute ψ† σx ψ.

Alternatively, maybe I should compute each term step by step. So:

σx ψ is [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5]^T. Then, ψ† is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2].

So ψ† (σx ψ) is (0.5)(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)(0.5) = (0.5 * sqrt(3)/2) is sqrt(3)/4, and the second term is also sqrt(3)/4, so total is sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660.

Yes, that's correct.

So the expectation value of 10σz +5σx is (-5) + (5 * 0.8660). Let's compute that.

5 * 0.866 is 4.33. So -5 +4.33 is -0.67. Hmm, but wait, let me compute exactly.

But wait, is there any mistake in the calculation? Because 0.5 plus 0.5 is 1, but in this case, the coefficients are 0.5 and sqrt(3)/2. Wait, 0.5 squared is 0.25, and (sqrt(3)/2)^2 is 3/4, so 0.25 +0.75 =1, so the state is normalized. No problem there.

Wait another thing, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of ψ† σx ψ. Let me calculate it again.

The state is
