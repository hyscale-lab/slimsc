Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is asking. 

The question says: Two quantum states have energies E1 and E2 with lifetimes of 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. We want to clearly distinguish these two energy levels. The options given are four different energy differences, and I need to pick the one that allows them to be clearly resolved.

Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the uncertainty principle plays a role in energy measurements. Oh right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, which states that certain pairs of physical properties cannot be simultaneously measured with arbitrary precision. Specifically, the energy-time uncertainty principle says that the product of the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) and the uncertainty in time (Δt) is at least ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant.

So, the energy-time uncertainty principle formula is ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2. But wait, I think the exact form might have a factor of 1 or 2, but I think for this problem, the exact factor isn't crucial because we're looking for an order of magnitude.

In this case, the lifetimes given are the lifetimes of the states. I think the uncertainty in time Δt would be related to the lifetime. Like, the lifetime τ is the time over which the state exists, so the uncertainty in time would be on the order of τ. So, Δt ≈ τ.

So, the uncertainties in energy would be ΔE ≈ ħ / (2τ). Alternatively, sometimes it's written as ΔE ≈ ħ / τ because sometimes people use Δt as the time width, which is about τ. Either way, the idea is that the energy uncertainty is inversely proportional to the lifetime.

Wait, but wait. The energy difference between the two states is what we need to clearly distinguish them. So, the energy difference ΔE must be larger than the uncertainty in energy for each state. Because if the energy difference is smaller than the uncertainty, they might appear as a single peak, making it hard to distinguish them.

Wait, no. The two states have their own lifetimes. So perhaps each state has an uncertainty in energy based on their own lifetimes. So, the energy difference ΔE between E2 and E1 must be larger than the sum of their individual energy uncertainties. Or maybe each has their own uncertainty, and the combined uncertainty is the maximum of the two? I'm a bit confused here.

Let me think again. For two states to be distinguishable, the energy difference between them should be greater than the combined uncertainty from each state. Because if the energy difference is too small, the lines (or peaks) in the spectrum would overlap, making it hard to tell them apart.

So, for each state, the uncertainty
