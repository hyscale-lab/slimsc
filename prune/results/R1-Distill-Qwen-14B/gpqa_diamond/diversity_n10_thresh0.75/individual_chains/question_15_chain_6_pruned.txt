Okay, so I have this question about detecting exoplanets using the transit method. Hmm, I remember that the transit method involves a planet passing in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability of this happening depends on the size of the planet and the star, and the alignment of the orbit.

The question says there are two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have been detected via the radial velocity (RV) method. So their minimum masses are known, but I think RV doesn't give the exact mass unless we know the inclination. But wait, the RV method gives us the minimum mass because the true mass could be higher depending on the inclination angle.

But in this case, both planets have the same mass. Oh wait, the question says they have the same masses. So M1 = M2. But their orbital periods are different. Planet_1 has an orbital period three times shorter than Planet_2. So Planet_1's period is P1, and P2 is 3*P1.

The host stars have different masses. Planet_1's star is twice as massive as Planet_2's star. But both stars have the same radii. So, M1_host = 2 * M2_host, R1 = R2.

I need to find which planet has a higher probability of transiting. The transit probability depends on the size of the star and the planet, and the orbital distance. The formula for transit probability is something like (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1 / (a^2)), but I might be mixing things up. Wait, actually, the transit probability (P) is proportional to (R_p / R_s)^2 times (1 / (a^2)), or is it a different relation?

Wait, I think the probability is (R_p + R_s) but actually, wait, no. The transit probability formula is more accurately given by the ratio of the planet's orbital distance to the sum of the star's radius and the planet's radius, but it's more complicated because the orbit is a circle, so the probability depends on the alignment.

Wait, I might be getting confused. Let me think again. The transit probability is the ratio of the area of the planet's disk to the area of the star's disk, but scaled by the likelihood that the orbit's plane aligns such that the planet crosses our line of sight. Oh, right, the probability is the ratio of the star's radius to the planet's orbital distance, but I think the formula is a bit more involved.

Wait, no. I remember that the probability of a transit is given by the formula P ≈ (R_p / R_s)² multiplied by (1 / (a (1 + sqrt(1 - (R_p^2 + R_s^2)/(a^2)) )) )? Hmm, no, that might not be right. Wait, another approach: the transit probability is the area of the planet's disk divided by the area of the star's disk, which is (R_p / R_s)^2. But that's only part of it because the planet has to be in the right part of the orbit. Oh wait, actually, the probability is higher when the planet is closer to the star because the star is smaller in the sky.

Wait, no, the transit probability is calculated using the relative size of the planet's orbit compared to the star's size. The
