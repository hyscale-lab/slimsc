Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Let me see if I can figure it out. Hmm, the question is about two electrons in a p orbital angular momentum state, and we're supposed to find the joint probability of both having their Lz components as -ħ. 

Wait, the state given is |l1, l2, l, m> = |1,1,2,-1>. So each electron has l1=1 and l2=1. The total angular momentum quantum number l is 2, and m is -1. Oh right, for each orbital angular momentum, the possible m values are -l, -l+1, ..., 0, ..., l. So for l=1, m can be -1, 0, +1.

But the question says to ignore the spin angular momentum. So we're only considering the orbital angular momentum here. Each electron has l=1, so their individual m values (m1 and m2) must add up to the total m of the system, which is -1. So m1 + m2 = -1. 

Wait, the given state is a coupled state. So the state is |1,1,2,-1>, which is a specific combination of the individual and total angular momenta. Now, when we measure L1z and L2z, each can have eigenvalues m1ħ and m2ħ, respectively. Because Lz |m> = mħ |m> for each particle.

The problem is asking for the joint probability that both L1z and L2z are measured as -ħ. So we're looking for the probability that m1 = -1 and m2 = -1.

But wait, m1 + m2 = m_total. Here, m_total is -1. So if m1 is -1, then m2 would have to be 0. Because (-1) + 0 = -1. Alternatively, if m2 is -1, then m1 must be 0. So the only way that both m1 and m2 are -1 is if their sum is -2, but the total m is -1. That's impossible, right? Because -1 + (-1) = -2, which doesn't match m=-1.

So that means there's no way for both m1 and m2 to be -1 when the total m is
