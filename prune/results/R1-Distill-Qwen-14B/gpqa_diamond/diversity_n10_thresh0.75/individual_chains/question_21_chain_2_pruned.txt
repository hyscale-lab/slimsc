Okay, so I have this chemistry question to answer, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. Let's break down what's being asked here.

The question is about isomers and some specific compounds. The first part (A) is about which compound doesn't show tautomerism, and the second part (B) is about which of the given compounds exhibits optical isomerism.

Hmm, so let me start by understanding what each term means. Tautomerism is when a compound can shift its structure through a series of steps, usually involving the movement of a hydrogen atom and a shift in double bonds. This is common in compounds with conjugated systems, especially with carbonyl groups. For example, in keto-enol tautomerism, a carbonyl group can tautomerize to an enol form.

Then, optical isomerism refers to compounds that have chiral centers, leading to enantiomers. These are stereoisomers that are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, causing plane-polarized light to rotate, hence optical activity.

Looking at the compounds given:

For part A: The compounds are benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione.

Benzoquinone is a cyclic compound with two ketone groups. Wait, benzoquinone can be either para or ortho, but I think in this context, it's para. So it's like a benzene ring with two oxygen double bonds, right? Wait no, quinones are cyclic with two ketone groups. So benzoquinone has two ketone groups opposite each other on the benzene ring. So its structure is O=C6H4=O.

Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is a six-membered ring with three ketone groups. Each of the 1,3,5 positions has a carbonyl group. So the structure is like three alternating carbonyl groups in a ring. So O=C-C-O=C-C-O=C-C, but arranged in a ring.

Now, which of these doesn't show tautomerism? Well, tautomerism occurs when there's an acidic hydrogen alpha to a carbonyl group. Let's think about each compound.

Benzoquinone: The carbonyl groups are conjugated in the ring. The alpha carbons are the ones adjacent
