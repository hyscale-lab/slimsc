Okay, so I've got this astronomy question about exoplanets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, let me think. I remember that equilibrium temperature is related to the star's luminosity and the planet's distance from the star. Oh right, the formula is something like T = T_star * (L / (16πσd²))^(1/4), but maybe I should think in terms of the inverse square law for distances since the albedo is the same for all planets.

Wait, the question says they're in orbital resonance and have periods in a ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. So each planet's period is a multiple of the first one. Let me list them out. Planet_1 has a period P1, Planet_2 is 2P1, Planet_3 is 2.5P1, Planet_4 is 3.5P1, and Planet_5 is 5P1. 

But wait, orbital period relates to distance via Kepler's third law. Right, Kepler's law says that the square of the period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis. So P² ∝ a³. So a ∝ P^(2/3). 

So the distance of each planet from the star depends on their period. Since we need the equilibrium temperature ratio between Planet_4 and Planet_2, I should find their distances first.
