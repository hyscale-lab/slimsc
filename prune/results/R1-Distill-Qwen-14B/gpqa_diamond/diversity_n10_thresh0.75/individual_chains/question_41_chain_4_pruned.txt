Okay, so I've got this physics problem about the speed of light in a moving medium. Hmm, I remember that when light travels through a medium like glass, its speed changes. Oh right, the speed of light in a medium is v = c/n, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum and n is the refractive index. But wait, the question says the glass is moving, so how does that affect the speed relative to the observer?

Wait, the glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the light beam. The beam is moving towards the observer, and the glass is moving towards the observer as well. So the glass is moving in the same direction as the light, but since the light is already moving towards us, does the movement of the glass affect the observed speed?

I'm a bit confused. I think this has something to do with special relativity, but wait, no. Because when velocities are much lower than the speed of light, we can use classical mechanics. But the speed of light is always c in a vacuum, regardless of the source's motion. Wait, no, that's in a vacuum. Here, the light is in the glass.

Wait, but the glass itself is moving. So how does that influence the speed measured by someone in the lab? Let me think. The light's speed in the glass is v = c/n, right? So if the glass is moving, does the observer see the light moving at v + v_glass (if the glass is moving in the same direction) or something like that?

Wait, no, because in the glass's frame, the light is moving at v = c
