Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about finding the energy spectrum of a particle in a two-dimensional potential. The potential is given as V(r, θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²(θ). Hmm, I need to figure out what the energy levels look like.

First, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the potential often determines the form of the Hamiltonian, which in turn gives the energy spectrum. Since the particle is moving in two dimensions, I should probably consider polar coordinates because the potential depends on r and θ. 

Looking at the potential, it's a sum of two terms. The first term is (1/2)k r², which looks like a harmonic oscillator term because the potential for a quantum harmonic oscillator is (1/2)mω²r². Wait, but in this case, the coefficient is k, so maybe I should think of it as something else. Oh wait, the general form is (1/2) m ω² r², so maybe k here is m ω². But I'm not sure yet.

The second term is (3/2)k r² cos²θ. That seems to depend on the angle θ. So the potential isn't spherically symmetric because it varies with θ. That probably means that the problem isn't separable in the usual radial and angular parts, but maybe I can separate it using different coordinates. Wait, perhaps using a coordinate transformation or some kind of effective potential approach.

Alternatively, sometimes potentials that are functions of r and cosθ can be rewritten in terms of other variables. Let me think about the angular part. Cos²θ can be expressed using a double-angle identity: cos²θ = (1 + cos2θ)/2. So substituting that into the potential:

V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² * (1 + cos2θ)/2.

Simplifying that, the second term becomes (3/4)k r² (1 + cos2θ). So the whole potential becomes:

V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/4) k r² + (3/4)k r² cos2θ.

Adding the first two terms: (1/2 + 3/4) k r² = (5/4)k r². So the potential is now:

V(r,θ) = (5/4)k r² + (3/4)k r² cos2θ.

Hmm, that might not immediately help, but perhaps it's pointing towards a coordinate system that's better suited for this problem. Wait, if I consider a transformation where one of the coordinates is 2θ, perhaps? Or maybe it's easier to think in terms of Cartesian coordinates, especially since the cos2θ term resembles the dependence in a two-dimensional harmonic oscillator.

Wait, another approach: sometimes potentials can be rewritten in terms of Cartesian coordinates. Let me think about that. Suppose we go to Cartesian coordinates (x, y), where x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ. Then r² = x² + y². The cos2θ term can be expressed in terms of x and y. Let's see: cos2θ = cos²θ - sin²θ = (x² - y²)/r². So substituting that into the potential:

V(r,θ) = (5/4)k r² + (3/4)k r² * (x² - y²)/r².

Simplify the second term: (3/4)k(x² - y²). So the potential becomes:

V(x,y) = (5/4)k(x² + y²) + (3/4)k(x² - y²).

Let me combine these terms. Expanding, the terms in x² and y²:

x² terms: (5/4 + 3/4)k x² = (8/4)k x² = 2k x².

y² terms: (5/4 - 3/4)k y² = (2/4)k y² = (1/2)k y².

So the potential simplifies to:

V(x,y) = 2k x² + (1/2)k y².

Wait a minute, that's a two-dimensional harmonic oscillator potential! Because typically, a 2D harmonic oscillator has potential (1/2) m ω² (x² + y²), but here it's scaled differently. So in x-direction, the potential is 2k x², and in y-direction, it's (1/2)k y². 

Wait, but to make it into a standard harmonic oscillator form, each term would have (1/2)m ω² coordinate². So for the x-direction, we can think of it as (1/2) m ω_x² x², where ω_x² = (4k)/m, since 2k x² = (1/2) m ω_x² x² → ω_x² = (4k)/m. Similarly, the y-direction would have (1/2) m ω_y² y², where ω_y² = (k)/m. So ω_x = 2 sqrt(k/m), and ω_y = sqrt(k/m).

In a two-dimensional harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are given by E = (n_x + n_y + 1) ħ ω, where ω is the average frequency, but wait, no, actually each direction contributes its own quantum number. The energy is the sum of the energies from each direction. Each direction's energy is (n + 1/2) ħ ω for each coordinate.

Wait, no, in a 2D isotropic harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are E = (n_x + n_y + 1) (ħ ω), but in this case, the frequencies are different. So the potential is an anisotropic harmonic oscillator.

So the energy for each direction is:

E_x = (n_x + 1/2) ħ ω_x,

E_y = (n_y + 1/2) ħ ω_y.

So the total energy E is E_x + E_y = (n_x + 1/2) ħ ω_x + (n_y + 1/2) ħ ω_y.

Substituting ω_x = 2 sqrt(k/m) and ω_y = sqrt(k/m), we get:

E = (n_x + 1/2) ħ (2 sqrt(k/m)) ) + (n_y + 1/2) ħ (sqrt(k/m)).

Simplify:

E = [2(n_x) + 1 + n_y + 1/2 ] * ħ sqrt(k/m).

Wait, let me compute each term:

(n_x + 1/2) * 2 = 2n_x + 1.

(n_y + 1/2) * 1 = n_y + 1/2.

Adding together:

2n_x + 1 + n_y + 1/2 = 2n_x + n_y + 3/2.

So E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2) ħ sqrt(k/m).

Wait, looking at the options, that would correspond to option C: E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2)ℏ*sqrt(k/m) ). But wait, let me check the options again.

Option C is E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m). Yes, that's correct according to this calculation.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the potential transformation.

Wait, the initial V(r,θ) had terms (1/2)k r² and (3/2)k r² cos²θ. When I expanded cos²θ as (1 + cos2θ)/2, that led to:

V(r,θ) = (5/4 k r²) + (3/4 k r² cos2θ).

Then, using x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ, so cos2θ = (x² - y²)/r².

Substituting that into the potential, we get:

V = (5/4)k(r²) + (3/4)k (x² - y²).

Since r² = x² + y², so:

= (5/4 k)(x² + y²) + (3/4 k x² - 3/4 k y²)

= (5/4 x² + 3/4 x²) + (5/4 y² - 3/4 y² ) 

= [ (5+3)/4 x² ] + [(5-3)/4 y² ]

= (8/4 x²) + (2/4 y² )

= 2 x² + (1/2) y².

Wait, that's correct. So the potential in Cartesian coordinates is V = 2k x² + (1/2)k y².

So each direction's frequency is different. The x-direction has a frequency ω_x such that (1/2) m ω_x² = 2k. Because the potential is (1/2)mω_x² x² = 2k x² → ω_x² = (4k)/m → ω_x = 2 sqrt(k/m).

Similarly, the y-direction has (1/2)m ω_y² = (1/2)k → ω_y² = (k)/m → ω_y = sqrt(k/m).

So each direction contributes:

E_x = (n_x + 1/2) ħ ω_x = (n_x + 1/2) ħ (2 sqrt(k/m)) = 2(n_x + 1/2) ħ sqrt(k/m)

E_y = (n_y + 1/2) ħ ω_y = (n_y + 1/2) ħ sqrt(k/m)

Adding these:

E = 2(n_x + 1/2) ħ sqrt(k/m) + (n_y + 1/2) ħ sqrt(k/m)

Let me factor out ħ sqrt(k/m):

E = [2(n_x + 1/2) + (n_y +1/2)] ħ sqrt(k/m)

Expanding:

2n_x + 1 + n_y + 1/2 = 2n_x + n_y + 3/2

So E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2) ℏ sqrt(k/m)

Which matches option C. So the correct answer should be option C.


The problem involves a quantum mechanical particle of mass \( m \) moving in a two-dimensional potential \( V(r, \theta) = \frac{1}{2}kr^2 + \frac{3}{2}kr^2\cos^2(\theta) \). To determine the energy spectrum, we analyze the potential and transform it into Cartesian coordinates.

### Step 1: Simplify the potential
The potential is rewritten using the trigonometric identity \( \cos^2(\theta) = \frac{1}{2}(1 + \cos(2\theta)) \), leading to:
\[
V(r, \theta) = \frac{5}{4}kr^2 + \frac{3}{4}kr^2\cos(2\theta).
\]
In Cartesian coordinates (\( x = r\cos\theta \), \( y = r\sin\theta \)), \( \cos(2\theta) = \frac{x^2 - y^2}{r^2} \). Substituting this into the potential gives:
\[
V(x, y) = 2kx^2 + \frac{1}{2}ky^2.
\]
This represents a two-dimensional anisotropic harmonic oscillator, where the potential in the \( x \)-direction is \( 2kx^2 \) and in the \( y \)-direction is \( \frac{1}{2}ky^2 \).

### Step 2: Determine the energy spectrum
The energy levels of a two-dimensional harmonic oscillator are the sum of the contributions from each direction. For the \( x \)-direction, the frequency is \( \omega_x = 2\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \), and for the \( y \)-direction, the frequency is \( \omega_y = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \). The energy for each direction is:
\[
E_x = \left(n_x + \frac{1}{2}\right)\hbar\omega_x, \quad E_y = \left(n_y + \frac{1}{2}\right)\hbar\omega_y.
\]
Substituting \( \omega_x = 2\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \) and \( \omega_y = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \), the total energy becomes:
\[
E = \left(2n_x + n_y + \frac{3}{2}\right)\hbar\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}.
\]

### Step 3: Match with the options
The derived energy spectrum matches **Option C**:
\[
E = (2n_x + n_y + \frac{3}{2})\hbar\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}.
\]

Answer: C
