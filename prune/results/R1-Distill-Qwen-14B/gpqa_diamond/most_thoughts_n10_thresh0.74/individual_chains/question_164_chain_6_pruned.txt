Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here about binary star systems. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The question says there are two systems, system_1 and system_2. Both have eclipses with different periods. System_1 has a period of 2 years, and system_2 has 1 year. Then, there are radial velocity (RV) observations. In system_1, the stars have RV amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. System_2's stars have amplitudes of 15 and 10 km/s. The question asks by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2. The options are A to D.

Wait, I remember that in binary star systems, the radial velocity curves are related to the masses of the stars. The more massive star has a smaller velocity amplitude because it's less massive stars are moving faster around the center of mass. Oh right, because the center of mass is closer to the more massive star.

So, the formula I think is that the mass ratio is inversely proportional to the velocity amplitudes. So if star A has velocity v_A, and star B has v_B, then the mass ratio M_A/M_B = v_B / v_A. 

But wait, I'm a little confused. Wait, the total mass of the system would be M_total = M_A + M_B. But each star's mass is related to the other's velocity. So the mass function comes into play here. Oh, right, the mass function is (v^3 * P) / (2πG), but I'm not sure if that's necessary here.

Wait, perhaps a simpler approach. The velocity amplitudes are inversely proportional to the masses. So if in system_1, the two velocities are 10 and 5, their mass ratio is 5:10, so 1:2. So M1 (primary) is twice as massive as the secondary in system_1. So the mass of system_1 would be M1 + M2 = 2m + m = 3m.

In system_2, the velocities are 15 and 10. So the mass ratio is 10:15, which simplifies to 2:3. So M1 (primary) is 3 parts, M2 is 2 parts. So the total mass is 5 parts.

Wait, but how does this relate to the periods? Oh wait, the period is the same for both stars in a binary system. But in this problem, the periods are different between the two systems. So system_1 has a period of 2 years, system_2 has 1 year.

I think the key here is to find the mass of each system and compare them. The masses would be related to the velocity amplitudes and the period.

The formula I remember is that the velocity amplitude (K) is related to the mass of the companion. The formula is K = (2π G P)^(-1/3) * (M_companion) / ( (1 + q) )^(2/3) ), where q is the mass ratio (M_secondary / M_primary). But maybe I should think in terms of the mass function.

Alternatively, the mass of the binary system can be found using
