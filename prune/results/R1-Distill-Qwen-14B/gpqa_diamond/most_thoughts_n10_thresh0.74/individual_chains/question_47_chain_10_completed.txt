Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out which compound matches the given spectroscopic data. Let's see, the compound is C9H11NO2. The options are four different structures, so I'll have to analyze the IR and NMR data to determine which one it is.

First, let's look at the IR data. There are medium to strong bands around 3420 and 3325 cm⁻¹. Those are typical of N-H stretches, right? Those wavenumbers are usually where amides or amines show up. Then there's a strong band at 1720 cm⁻¹. That's a carbonyl stretch. Carbonyls in esters, amides, or ketones usually appear around there. So maybe it's an ester or an amide.

Now, looking at the 1H NMR data. Let me list the peaks:

- 1.20 ppm, triplet, 3H: That's probably a CH2CH3 group, like an ethyl ester. The triplet suggests coupling with two neighboring protons, so maybe it's the CH2 next to the oxygen in an ethyl group.
- 4.0 ppm, broad singlet, 2H: Hmm, broad signals often indicate exchange with protons, like in an amide. But wait, the integration is 2H. Maybe it's an NH2 group, but NMR of amines can be tricky. Or maybe it's an OCH2 group, but OCH2 would typically be around 3.5-4.5 ppm. Alternatively, maybe it's an NH adjacent to something else. Alternatively, could it be an ethoxy group? No, ethoxy is usually a triplet around 1.2 and 4.0 for the OCH2CH3, but in this case, one of the peaks is at 4.0, but the integration is 2H. Hmm, maybe something else.
- 4.5 ppm, quartet, 2H: A quartet with 2H. Quartet implies coupling with three adjacent protons, but wait, 2H as quartet. Maybe it's a CH2 group next to another CH2. Like in an ester, perhaps. For example, an ethyl group connected to an oxygen. The quartet at 4.5 ppm could be the OCH2 in an ester group (like OCH2CH3), but wait, the 1.20 is the triplet for the CH3. So perhaps the quartet is the OCH2. So, the 4.5 quartet and 1.2 triplet suggest an ethyl ester group. So that would mean something like an ester substituent, maybe OEt (ethoxy).
- Then, the aromatic region: 7.0 ppm (doublet, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (doublet, 2H). This suggests a para-substituted aromatic ring. Because in para substitution, each substituent has two protons, and the coupling would give two doublets. So, for example, a benzamide where the amide is attached at the para position to another substituent.

Putting this together, the molecule likely has an ethyl ester group and a para-substituted benzene ring with a substituent that involves a carbonyl group, possibly an amide or formamide.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure would be benzamide with an ethoxy group at the meta position. But if it's meta, the aromatic protons wouldn't give two doublets. Wait, no, if it's a para substituent, the substituents are across. So in this case, maybe benzamide has another substituent on the ring in the para position. But wait, 3-ethoxy would be meta. So the aromatic protons would be more complex, maybe a triplet or something else.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. So the formamide is attached to the benzene ring, and the ethoxy is at the para position. So the substituents are 4-ethoxy and the formamide (CONH2) at the para position? Wait, no, formamide is HCONR2. So in this case, the structure would be benzene with an OCH2CH3 group and a formamide group (HCONH- attached to the ring). So the aromatic protons would be two doublets, which matches the NMR data. Also, the IR would show the amide N-H stretches and the carbonyl.

Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. Propionate would be an ethyl ester (CH2CH2COO-), but wait, propionate is CH2CH2COO-, but I'm not sure... Wait, propionate is CH2CH2COO-? Actually, wait, propionic acid is CH2CH2COOH, so the ester would be CH2CH2COO-R. So in this case, the propionate would be attached as an ester to the benzene ring. The 4-aminophenyl group would have an amino group attached. But then, the NMR would show a broad peak for the NH2 group, but the integration in the NMR is 2H at 4.0 ppm. Also, the NH2 would probably appear as a broad peak, maybe a singlet, but in this case, it's 2H as a broad singlet. Hmm. Wait, in option D, there's an ethyl ester and an aminobenzoate.

Wait, let me think again. Option C is 4-aminophenyl propionate. The structure would be benzene with NH2 at para and the propionate (which is an ester, like CH2CH2COOEt) attached. So the NMR would have the ethyl group (1.20, triplet, 3H; 4.5, quartet, 2H). Then, the amino group would have protons, but amines are usually broad, but in this case, it's a secondary amine? Or primary? Wait, 4-aminophenyl would be a primary amine group. So in the NMR, the NH would show up as broad, possibly around 1-5 ppm, but in the data, the 4.0 ppm peak is 2H. Wait, for a primary amine, the NH would be a singlet, but maybe if it's in a different environment. But perhaps the amine is exchanging and not showing up as a peak, but that's less likely. Alternatively, perhaps it's an NH2 group, which would be a broad peak but integrating for 2H. But in the data, the 4.0 is a singlet. So maybe that's not matching. Also, the IR shows N-H stretches, which would align with the amine or amide.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Structure is benzene ring with NH2 at para and an ester group (COOEt) attached. So the benzoate is the COOEt group. The aromatic protons would be two doublets, which matches the NMR. The ester would give the triplet (1.20 ppm, 3H) and quartet (4.5 ppm, 2H). The amine group would be NH2, but in the NMR, the 4.0 ppm is a broad singlet for 2H. Wait, the NH2 would typically be a broad peak, but integration with 2H? Wait, amines are usually NH2 groups, which are two protons. So perhaps that peak at 4.0 is the NH2, as a broad singlet. But wait, in D, the NH2 is attached to the ring, so it's a para-aminophenyl group. The NH2 would have two H's, but in the NMR, they're broad. But in the data, 4.0 ppm, 2H (bs) could be the NH2 as a singlet or a broad peak. Alternatively, maybe it's an amide, but let's think about the carbonyl.

Wait, the IR has a strong band at 1720 cm⁻¹. For esters, the carbonyl is around 1740-1700, and amides are lower, around 1650-1680. So if the IR is 1720, that's close to an ester, perhaps. So if the compound is an ester, like ethyl benzoate or something similar, then option D would have a benzoate ester (COOEt) and an amine group, but in that case, the amide's carbonyl would be lower. Wait, no, in option D, it's ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, which would have a benzoate ester. So the carbonyl is part of the ester. The IR would show a strong band around 1720, which fits. The amine would have N-H stretches, which match the IR data.

Now, looking back at the NMR data. The 4.0 ppm, 2H, broad singlet. That would be the NH2 group. So in D, the NH2 is attached to the ring. So the NH2 would be in the aromatic region. But in the given NMR, the aromatic peaks are at 7.0 and 8.0, which are the two doublets for the para-substituted ring. So the NH2 is probably not in the aromatic region. Wait, no, the NH2 is part of the ring substituent. So in the NMR, the NH2 would be in the region of 4.0 ppm. Wait, but amines usually have protons around 1-5 ppm, but aromatic amines can be deshielded. For example, aniline protons are around 6.5-7.5. But in this case, the NH2 is attached to the ring. But in the NMR, the only peaks in aromatic region are 7.0 and 8.0. So the NH2's protons are not in that region. So the peak at 4.0 ppm is two H's, but perhaps it's an NH group or something else.

Wait, let's think again. The aromatic region shows two doublets, which is consistent with a para-substituted ring with two substituents. So the ring has two substituents: one is an ester group (COOEt) and another is an amine group (NH2), perhaps. Or maybe a substituent and a carbonyl group like a benzamide.

Wait, looking at the options: option B is N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. That would be a benzamide where the amide is attached to the ring (position 4), and the ethoxy group is also at position 4. Wait, that would be the same position, which isn't possible. Wait, no, the formamide is attached to the benzene ring, and the ethoxy is at the 4 position relative to the formamide. So the structure would be formamide attached at position 1, and ethoxy at position 4. So the ring would have substituents at 1 and 4, making them para to each other. But then the aromatic protons would be two doublets, which fits. The formamide would have a CONH2 group attached to the ring. The ethoxy group would be at the para position.

So in the NMR, the ethoxy group would have the triplet (1.20, 3H) and the quartet (4.5, 2H). The formamide would have an NH group. Wait, formamide is HCONH2. So the NH2 would have two protons. But in the NMR data, the singlet at 4.0 ppm is 2H. Wait, formamide's NH2 protons are usually around 8-9 ppm as broad peaks. But in the given data, there's no such peak. Hmm, maybe it's not the formamide. Alternatively, maybe the NH is part of an amide group which is less deshielded, but I'm a bit confused here.

Alternatively, let's think about each option's structure and how they would appear in the NMR.

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Benzamide with ethoxy at meta. The ring would have substituents at positions 3 and 4? Wait, benzamide is a CONH2 group attached to the benzene. If the ethoxy is at position 3, then the ring would have substituents at 3 and para to each other? No, maybe the positions are 1 (benzamide) and 3 (ethoxy), which are meta to each other. So the aromatic protons would be in two sets, perhaps, but the splitting might be more complex than two doublets. So maybe the NMR wouldn't just show two doublets. So probably, option A's NMR wouldn't match the given data.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. So the formamide (HCONH2) is attached to the benzene ring, and the ethoxy is at the para position. So the substituents are at positions 1 (formamide) and 4 (ethoxy). So the ring would have two substituents para to each other. The aromatic protons would then be two doublets, which matches the NMR. The ethoxy group would give the triplet (1.20 ppm) and quartet (4.5 ppm) as in the data. The formamide's NH2 would have protons. But in the data, the 4.0 ppm peak is a broad singlet for 2H. Formamide's NH2 typically appears around 8-9 ppm, but maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the formamide's NH is not present, or maybe it's a different group. Wait, formamide has two NH protons. So if the NMR doesn't show peaks around 8 ppm, maybe this isn't the right option. Alternatively, maybe the amide is deprotonated, but I don't think that's the case here.

Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. So the propionate ester is attached to the benzene ring, and there's an amino group at the para position. The propionate ester would have an ethyl group (since propionic acid is CH2CH2COOH, so the ester would be CH2CH2COOEt). Wait, actually, propionate is CH2CH2COO- as the ester. So in the NMR, the ethyl would give the triplet (1.20, 3H) and quartet (4.5, 2H). The amino group would be NH2. In the NMR, the 4.0 ppm is a broad singlet for 2H. So that would correspond to the NH2 group. The aromatic region would have two doublets, which fits. But the IR data: the strong band at 1720 cm⁻¹ would be the ester carbonyl. The N-H stretches would come from the amine. So that could fit. But what about the protons on the amino group? In the NMR, the NH2 would typically show up as a broad peak, maybe around 1-5 ppm. But in this case, it's at 4.0, which is a bit high, but not impossible.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. So the benzoate ester is attached to the ring, and the amino group is at the para position. The benzoate ester's carbonyl would show up around 1720 cm⁻¹, matching the IR. The ester's ethyl group would give the triplet (1.20 ppm) and quartet (4.5 ppm). The amino group is NH2, which would show a broad peak in the NMR. In the data, the 4.0 ppm is a broad singlet of 2H. So that could fit the NH2. The aromatic protons would be two doublets, which matches.

Now, comparing the options, let's think about the 4.0 ppm peak. For option D, that's the amino group's NH2. But amines typically have protons that are more downfield than that. Wait, aromatic amines can have protons in the 4-5 ppm range. For example, aniline's NH is around 5 ppm. But that's the proton attached to the ring. Wait, no, aniline's NH is a singlet around 4.5-5 ppm. But in the case of NH2, like para-aminophenyl, the NH2 would have two protons. So in the NMR, the 4.0 ppm (2H, bs) could be the NH2 group.

Wait, but in the NMR data, the 4.0 ppm is a broad singlet integrating for 2H, which would fit an NH2 group. So for option D, that would make sense. The ethyl ester would account for the triplet and quartet. The aromatic doublets would be due to the para substitution. The IR carbonyl would be from the ester. The N-H stretches would be from the amine.

Alternatively, for option B, the formamide's NH2 would be expected around 8 ppm, but the data doesn't show that. So probably, option B is not the correct one.

So putting it all together, the correct structure would be ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, which is option D.


The compound C₉H₁₁NO₂ is identified using the provided spectroscopic data:

### IR Analysis:
- **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹**: Medium to strong bands, indicative of N-H stretches, likely from an amine or amide group.
- **1720 cm⁻¹**: Strong band, characteristic of a carbonyl group, likely from an ester or amide.

### ¹H NMR Analysis:
1. **1.20 ppm (t, 3H)**: A triplet integrating for 3H, consistent with a CH₃ group in an ethyl group (CH₂CH₃).
2. **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H)**: A broad singlet integrating for 2H, likely from an NH₂ group or a deshielded CH₂ group.
3. **4.5 ppm (q, 2H)**: A quartet integrating for 2H, characteristic of a CH₂ group adjacent to an oxygen atom, likely part of an ethyl ester (OCH₂CH₃).
4. **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H)**: Two doublets integrating for 2H each, indicative of a para-substituted aromatic ring.

### Option Analysis:
- **Option A (3-ethoxybenzamide)**: The ethoxy group would produce the triplet (1.20 ppm) and quartet (4.5 ppm), but the benzamide structure would result in a more complex splitting pattern in the aromatic region due to meta substitution, inconsistent with the observed two doublets. This option is unlikely.

- **Option B (N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide)**: The ethoxy group matches the triplet (1.20 ppm) and quartet (4.5 ppm). However, the formamide group (HCONH₂) would typically show NH₂ protons around 8-9 ppm in the NMR, which is not observed. Additionally, the IR data does not strongly support the presence of a formamide carbonyl, which is lower than 1720 cm⁻¹. This option is unlikely.

- **Option C (4-aminophenyl propionate)**: The ester group would produce the triplet (1.20 ppm) and quartet (4.5 ppm), and the para-amino group would result in the observed aromatic doublets. However, the NH₂ group of the amine would typically appear as a broad peak around 1-5 ppm, and the integration at 4.0 ppm (2H) does not clearly match an NH₂ group. This option is less likely.

- **Option D (ethyl 4-aminobenzoate)**: The ethyl ester group matches the triplet (1.20 ppm) and quartet (4.5 ppm). The para-aminobenzoate structure explains the two doublets in the aromatic region (7.0 ppm and 8.0 ppm). The NH₂ group accounts for the broad singlet at 4.0 ppm (2H). The IR band at 1720 cm⁻¹ corresponds to the ester carbonyl, and the N-H stretches match the amine group. This option is consistent with all the data.

### Conclusion:
The spectroscopic data is most consistent with **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.
