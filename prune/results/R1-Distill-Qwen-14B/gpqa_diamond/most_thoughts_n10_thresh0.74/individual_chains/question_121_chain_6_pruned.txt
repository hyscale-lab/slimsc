Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because stereochemistry can be tricky. Let me try to break it down.

The question is about the reaction between a saturated epoxide and an organocuprate reagent, Me2CuLi. The compound given is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. I need to figure out which product it forms from the given options.

First, what do I know about epoxide reactions with organocuprates? I remember that when epoxides react with cuprates, they undergo a type of nucleophilic ring-opening reaction. Organocuprates are strong nucleophiles because the cuprate ion is a good leaving group.

Wait, no, wait. Organocuprates are actually the nucleophiles here. They act as nucleophiles in such reactions. So the cuprate attacks the less hindered carbon of the epoxide ring because the reaction tends to proceed via a two-step mechanism. The cuprate's methyl group (in this case, since it's Me2CuLi, the donor is two methyl groups) adds to the less substituted carbon, and the epoxide oxygen then takes the leaving group, which is the cuprate's copper.

But wait, correction: Organocuprates typically add to epoxides in a way where the nucleophile (the cuprate) attacks the less hindered carbon because that's more accessible. The ring opens, and the nucleophile adds to that carbon, while the other oxygen becomes an alcohol after the workup. Or wait, maybe the oxygen ends up with a hydroxide or something else after the reaction?

Wait, no. The mechanism is that the cuprate (like Me2Cu-) attacks the less hindered carbon of the epoxide, opening the ring. The oxygen then gets a negative charge, but because the solution is usually aqueous, it picks up a proton during workup, forming an alcohol.

But in this case, the epoxide is bicyclic. The structure is bicyclo[4.1.0]heptane with an oxygen at position 7. So the numbering is a bit tricky. Bicyclo[4.1.0]heptane has two rings: one is a four-membered ring and the other is a bridge. Let me imagine the structure. So the
