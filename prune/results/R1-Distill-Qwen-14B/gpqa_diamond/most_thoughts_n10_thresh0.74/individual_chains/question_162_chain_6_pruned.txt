Okay, so I have this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius r=2. Hmm, I remember that a pseudosphere is like a surface in hyperbolic geometry, right? But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the details. Let's see.

The metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) * (dx² + dy²). Hmm, that looks a bit like a conformally flat metric, because the coefficients for dx² and dy² are the same. So if I consider this in the (x,y) plane, it's scaled by some function. 

Wait, the pseudosphere is a surface in 2D spacetime? Or is it a higher-dimensional object? I think in this context, we're dealing with a 2D surface embedded in higher dimensions, but perhaps in the context of the metric given, it's a 2D manifold.

The question is asking for the area of the pseudosphere when the radius r is 2. I remember that for spheres, the area is 4πr². But a pseudosphere is different because of its negative curvature. I think the area might be infinite because hyperbolic surfaces have infinite area, but wait, not all of them. Like, a finite hyperbolic surface can have finite area if it's compact.

Wait, but the pseudosphere is a specific surface, right? It's a tractricoid, which is the surface of revolution of a tractrix. I think it's a finite area surface with constant negative curvature. Oh right, the tractricoid has finite area. So if the radius is
