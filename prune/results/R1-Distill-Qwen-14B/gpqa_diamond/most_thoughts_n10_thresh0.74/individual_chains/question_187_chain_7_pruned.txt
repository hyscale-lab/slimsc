Okay, so I've got this question about the ESPRESSO spectrograph and which stars are detectable. Hmm, I need to figure out how many of these stars meet the S/N ratio condition. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that ESPRESSO is a high-resolution spectrograph used on the VLT. It's designed for things like detecting exoplanets, I think. But the key here is the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) per binned pixel during a 1-hour exposure. The requirement is S/N of at least 10 per binned pixel.

Wait, but how do I calculate the S/N for each star? Oh right, it depends on the star's brightness, which is related to its apparent magnitude. The lower the magnitude, the brighter the star. So I'll need to find the apparent V magnitude for each star, then determine if ESPRESSO can achieve an S/N of 10 in an hour.

ESPRESSO's sensitivity depends on the photon flux it receives. The formula for photon flux is something like S/N = sqrt(N_photons), where N_photons is the number of photons collected. But maybe I can use an approximate formula or some reference data.

I recall that the V magnitude relates to the number of photons a telescope receives. For a star of V magnitude m, the photon flux F is given by F = F_0 * 10^(-0.4*m), where F_0 is a reference flux. But without knowing F_0, maybe I need to find the relationship between the apparent magnitude and the exposure time.

Wait, perhaps the ESPRESSO system has a certain limiting magnitude for a given exposure time and S/N. If I can find that, I can compare each star's apparent magnitude to the limit.

Alternatively, I remember that the V magnitude of a star determines how much light it emits. For each star in the options, I can calculate their apparent V magnitude using the distance modulus formula: m = M + 5 + 5*log10(d), where M is the absolute magnitude and d is the distance in parsecs.

Let me list each option and compute their m:

Option a) Canopus. I think Canopus is a very bright star, something like magnitude -5 or so? Wait, no, wait. Canopus is the brightest star in the sky after Sirius. Let
