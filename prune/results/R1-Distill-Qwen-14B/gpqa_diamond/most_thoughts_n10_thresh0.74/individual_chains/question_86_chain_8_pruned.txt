Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let's take it step by step. The question involves two reactions where compounds A and B are treated with different reducing agents, resulting in specific products.

First, let me read the question again. It says that a chemist performed two reactions using two unknown compounds. Each was treated with a different reducing agent. The products are both (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, but from different starting materials, A and B.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, looking again. Oh, actually, each reaction produces a specific enantiomer. The first reaction, using A and LiBH4 and some H+, gives R-enantiomer. The second, using B and BH3 and H+, gives S-enantiomer.

So the products are enantiomers of each other, but since they're from different starting materials, the starting materials must have different configurations that lead to each product.

I remember that the type of reducing agent can influence the stereochemistry of the product, especially in ketone reductions. LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, and BH3 is typically used in hydroboration reactions, but wait, wait. Wait, no, wait. Wait a second—LiBH4 is usually for ketones, but BH3 is used in hydroboration-oxidation. Oh, but maybe in this case, both are being used as reducing agents for ketones? Or perhaps for something else.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, the starting materials are compounds A and B, and they're being reduced. The products are 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-ones, which are cyclic ketones, but wait—no, wait. Wait, no, looking at the product: 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. So that's a cyclic ketone. Pyran has six members, with an oxygen. So 2H-pyran-2-one would be a cyclic ester? Or wait, no, pyran-2-one would be a five-membered ring? Wait, wait, wait. Wait, no, pyran is a six-membered ring, right? So 2H-pyran-2-one would have a ketone
