Okay, so I just came across this physics problem, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. So, the question is about space travel and time dilation, right? I remember that when objects move at speeds close to the speed of light, time dilation occurs as per Einstein's theory of relativity. 

The problem says that an alien civilization has built a spacecraft that can travel at 0.99999987 times the speed of light. Their average lifetime is about 150 solar years, but the astronaut is 22 years old. The question is asking how long the trip to Earth will take from the astronaut's perspective. The options are whether the astronaut will die before reaching Earth, or the time taken is 72, 81, or 77 years.

Hmm, so I think this involves calculating the time experienced by the astronaut, which would be less due to time dilation compared to the time measured in Earth's frame of reference. Wait, but wait, the problem is asking from the astronaut's point of view, which is the proper time. So I need to compute the proper time experienced by the astronaut during the journey.

But wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think. The proper time is the shortest time measured between two events (like departure and arrival) in the frame where those events occur at the same place. In this case, for the astronaut, the journey starts and ends at their location, so their proper time is what we're after.

First, I need to find the distance between the Large Magellanic Cloud and Earth. Wait, I think the Large Magellanic Cloud is about 163,000 light-years away from Earth. Oh wait, wait, no, I think it's actually around 160,000 light-years. But wait, I'm not entirely sure. Let me double-check: I remember that the Andromeda galaxy is about 2.5 million light-years away, so the LMC must be much closer. Oh right, it's about 163,000 light-years. Yeah, so approximately 1.63e5 light-years.

Wait, but wait another thing. The spacecraft is traveling at 0.99999987 times the speed of light. That's extremely close to c. Maybe I can approximate it as just about c for some initial calculations, but perhaps I should be precise.

So, the distance to Earth from the LMC is around 163,000 light-years. But wait, the problem says "their destination is Earth," so the spacecraft is traveling from the LMC to Earth. So the distance is about 163,000 light-years.

But wait, wait, no. Wait, the Large Magellanic Cloud is a satellite galaxy of the Milky Way, so the distance is about 163,000 light-years. So the spacecraft has to cover that distance.

Wait, but wait, no, that can't be right. Wait, I think the correct distance is approximately 163,000 light-years. So, the distance is D = 163,000 light-years.

Now, from Earth's frame of reference, the time taken is the distance divided by the speed. So T = D / v.

But the astronaut's
