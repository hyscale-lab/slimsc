Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a boson. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it slow.

The question gives me a Lagrangian interaction term between a bosonic field X and some fermions. The Lagrangian is written as L(y) = -λf ψ̄_f (y)(υ + X(y))ψ_f(y). Hmm, I remember that the Lagrangian describes the interactions between particles. So, this term must represent how the boson X interacts with fermions.

Wait, but bosons mediate forces, right? Like how the photon is a boson that carries the electromagnetic force. So, maybe X is a force-carrying boson, and it's interacting with these fermions. The fermions involved here are ψ_f, and f is probably a type of fermion, like quarks or leptons.

The mass of the boson X is given as 6 GeV. So, when X decays, the decay products must have enough energy to meet their rest masses. Because in particle physics, the rest mass of the decay products must be less than or equal to the mass of the decaying particle for the decay to be possible. That's the conservation of energy and momentum, I think.

The question is about the kinematically allowed decays at the lowest order. So, we're looking for possible decay channels where X can decay into a pair of particles, like a fermion and its antiparticle.

Looking at the options, all the choices are various fermion-antifermion pairs. So, which of these pairs have a combined mass less than or equal to 6 GeV?

I should list out all the fermions and their masses. Let me remember the approximate masses for each:

- Electron (e): ~0.0005 GeV
- Muon (μ): ~0.105 GeV
- Tau (τ): ~1.777 GeV
- Up quark (u): ~1.5 MeV (0.0015 GeV)
- Down quark (d): ~3.3 MeV (0.0033 GeV)
- Strange quark (s): ~95 MeV (0.095 GeV)
- Charm quark (c): ~1.25 GeV
- Bottom quark (b): ~4.1-4.7 GeV (let's say around 4.5 GeV)
- Top quark (t): ~173 GeV (way too heavy)

Wait, so if X is 6 GeV, the decay products must each have a mass less than 3 GeV each? Because in pair production, each particle would take some of the mass. Oh, but that's not exactly right. Wait, the sum of the rest masses can be up to the mass of X, but each individual particle only needs to have mass less than X's mass. But when the boson decays, it's into two particles, so each fermion must have a mass such that 2m_fermion ≤ m_X.

Wait, no. If the boson X is at rest, the decay products must have each particle with mass less than or equal to m_X. Because if m_fermion is more than X's mass, you can't have a decay into that fermion since you can't produce a particle heavier than the parent.

Wait, no. Actually, the sum of the masses of the decay products must be less than or equal to the mass of the parent. But in the case of fermion-antifermion pairs, each fermion has mass m_f, so the sum is 2m_f. So, 2m_f ≤ m_X → m_f ≤ m_X / 2.

So, m_X is 6 GeV, so m_f can be up to 3 GeV. Because 6 GeV divided by 2 is 3 GeV.

So, which ferm
