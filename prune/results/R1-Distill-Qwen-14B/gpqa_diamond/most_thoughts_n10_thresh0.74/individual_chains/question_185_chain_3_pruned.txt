Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Hmm, let's see what it's about. The question is about finding the eigenvalues of a Hamiltonian operator. The Hamiltonian is given as H = ε σ · n, where σ is the vector of Pauli matrices, n is a unit vector, and ε is an energy constant. 

Wait, I remember Pauli matrices. They are 2x2 matrices, right? σ_x, σ_y, σ_z. Each of them has eigenvalues +1 and -1. Oh, but wait, when you have a vector like σ · n, you're taking the dot product. So that would be σ_x n_x + σ_y n_y + σ_z n_z. 

I think that the eigenvalues of a Pauli matrix are ±1, but when you take a linear combination like σ · n, the eigenvalues change. Because each Pauli matrix is multiplied by a component of n. But n is a unit vector, so n_x² + n_y² + n_z² = 1. 

Wait, I remember something about the eigenvalues of such an operator. The eigenvalues of σ · n should be ±1, but scaled by ε. Because the Hamiltonian is ε times that. So the overall eigenvalues would be ε times ±1, so ±ε. 

But wait, wait. Let me think again. The Pauli matrices each have eigenvalues ±1, but when you take σ · n, the eigenvalues are ±1 multiplied by the magnitude... wait, no, the operator σ · n itself has eigenvalues ±1. Because the
