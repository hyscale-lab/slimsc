Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the uncertainty principle. Hmm, I remember that the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle is involved when we're talking about the uncertainty in an electron's position and momentum, right? The question gives me the uncertainty in position (Δx) and the speed of the electron, and I need to find the minimum uncertainty in energy (ΔE). 

Wait, the speed is given as v = 2e8 m/s. That's pretty fast, but electrons are small particles so I guess that's feasible. The uncertainty in position is Δx = 0.1 nm. Oh wait, nanometers are 10^-9 meters, so 0.1 nm is 1e-10 meters? Or wait, 0.1 nm is 0.1 * 1e-9 m = 1e-10 m. Yeah, that's right.

Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle says that Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant. But wait, I think sometimes people use ΔxΔp ≈ ħ for order of magnitude estimates. So to find the uncertainty in momentum (Δp), I can rearrange that. Δp ≈ ħ / (2Δx). 

Wait, ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s. So plugging in Δx as 1e-10 m, let's calculate Δp. 

So Δp = ħ/(2Δx) = (1.05e-34) / (2 * 1e-10) = (1.05e-34)/(2e-10) = (1.05 / 2) * 1e-24. That's 0.525e-24, which is 5.25e-25 kg·m/s. 

But wait, another approach: since the electron is moving at speed v, the momentum p is mv. So if I can find the uncertainty in momentum, I can think about the uncertainty in energy. But I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Wait, but the question is about the uncertainty in energy, which would relate to the uncertainty in momentum and hence kinetic energy.

Right, because the kinetic energy K.E. is p²/(2m), where m is the mass of the electron. So the uncertainty in energy ΔE would be related to
