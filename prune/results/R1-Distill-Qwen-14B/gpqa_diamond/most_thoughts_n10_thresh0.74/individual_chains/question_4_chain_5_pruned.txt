Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this physics question about Maxwell's equations in a universe where magnets have isolated North or South poles. Hmm, I remember that in our universe, magnets always have both North and South poles; you can't isolate them. But in this other universe, somehow they can. So how would that affect Maxwell's equations?

Wait, Maxwell's equations describe how electric and magnetic fields propagate, interact, and behave. Let me recall the four equations. The first one is about the divergence of the electric field, Gauss's law. The second is about the divergence of the magnetic field, which in our world is zero because magnetic monopoles don't exist. The third is Faraday's law, dealing with the curl of the electric field. The fourth is Ampère's law, which includes the curl of the magnetic field and Maxwell's addition for displacement current.

So, in our universe, the divergence of B is zero. That's because there are no magnetic monopoles. But if in this other universe, you can have isolated North or South poles, that means magnetic monopoles exist. So the divergence of B wouldn't be zero anymore. The equation that would change is the second one, the divergence of B equals zero. Because now, there could be a magnetic charge density, right?

Wait, another thought: Maxwell's equations in their standard form with magnetic monopoles would have two modified equations. Because if you have monopoles, both the divergence of B and the curl of E would change. Or wait, no, the curl of E is related to the time derivative of B. Hmm.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The usual equations are:

1. ∇·E = ρ/ε₀ (Gauss's law for electric fields)
2. ∇·B = 0 (Gauss's law for magnetism)
3. ∇×E = -∂B/∂t (Faraday's law)
4. ∇×B = μ₀ (J + ε₀ ∂E/∂t) (Ampère's law)

If magnetic monopoles exist, then equation 2 would change. Because ∇·B would not be zero anymore. It would be something like μ_m ρ_m, where μ_m is the magnetic permeability and ρ_m is the magnetic charge density.

But wait, what about the other equations? Faraday's law might also change. Because in our universe, the curl of E is the negative
