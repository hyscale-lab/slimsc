Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I remember from my studies that a harmonic oscillator is a system where a mass experiences a restoring force proportional to its displacement. In the classical case, it's F = -kx, right? But this question is about the relativistic version, so I guess relativity comes into play here.

The question is asking for the maximum speed v_max of the mass. The options are given, and I need to choose the correct formula. Let me think about the setup. The oscillator has mass m, maximum amplitude A, and obeys Hooke's law F = -kx. So the potential energy is (1/2)kx², but since this is relativistic, I suppose the energy expressions change.

Wait, but wait, in the non-relativistic case, the maximum speed occurs when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. So at x=0, the potential energy is zero, and the kinetic energy is maximum. The maximum speed in that case would be v_max^2 = (kA²)/m. So that's option C. But this is the relativistic case, so I can't use that.

Right, in relativity, the energy is given by the total energy which includes rest mass energy. So the total energy E is gamma mc², where gamma is the Lorentz factor. But wait, how does this tie into the oscillator?

In the case of a relativistic harmonic oscillator, the potential energy isn't just (1/2)kx². Or is it? Or maybe the force is still F = -kx, but the equations of motion are different because of relativity.

Wait, I'm not entirely sure about the exact form of the potential. Let me think. In special relativity, forces can be a bit tricky because momentum isn't just mv anymore. The force would relate to the derivative of the relativistic momentum. So for a harmonic oscillator, the force is F = -kx. But the equation of motion would involve the relativistic momentum.

The equation of motion for a relativistic harmonic oscillator would be d(p)/dt = F, where p is the relativistic momentum. The relativistic momentum is p = gamma m v. So the equation would be d/dt (gamma m v) = -k x.

Hmm, I'm not sure. Maybe I need to approach this using energy. The total energy in relativity is E = gamma mc². But in the case of a harmonic oscillator, the total energy is also the sum of kinetic and potential energy. Wait, but in relativity, the kinetic energy isn't (1/2)mv². It's (gamma - 1)mc².

So, for the oscillator, the total energy E is the sum of the rest mass energy and the kinetic and potential energies. Wait, but for the oscillator, at maximum displacement (x=A), the velocity is zero, so all energy is potential. At x=0, velocity is maximum, so all energy is kinetic.

In the non-relativistic case: E =
