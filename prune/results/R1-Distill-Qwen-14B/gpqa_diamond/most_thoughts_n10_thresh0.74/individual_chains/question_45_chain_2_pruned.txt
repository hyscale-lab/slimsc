Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about four spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. Hmm, the question is asking me to find the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state. The options are given, and I need to choose the correct one.

Wait, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think. I remember that for particles in a 1D infinite well, each particle's energy depends on the quantum number n. The formula is E_n = (n²) * E, where E is the base energy given as E = π²ħ²/(2mL²). So each particle's energy is proportional to n squared.

But wait, there's a catch here. Since the particles are identical fermions, they must obey the Pauli exclusion principle. That means no two fermions can have the same set of quantum numbers. In a 1D well, each particle's state is determined by n and their spin. Since they're spin-1/2, each has two possible spin states: up and down.

So each energy level n can hold two particles—one with spin up and one with spin down. But wait, in the ground state, the lowest energy, the first two particles can have n=1 but opposite spins. Then the next two would have to go to the next available n. Oh right, because n=1 can only take two particles. So for four particles, that's two in n=1 and two in n=2.

Wait, no, wait. Each level n can hold two particles because of spin. So for four particles, the first two go into n=1 (each with opposite spins), then the next two go into n=2, again each with opposite spins. So the total energy would be 2*(E_1) + 2*(E_2) = 2*(1² E) + 2*(2² E) = 2E + 8E = 10E.

Wait, but wait, that's not right because the question is about the energies of the states of the system, not the total energy. Hmm, no,
