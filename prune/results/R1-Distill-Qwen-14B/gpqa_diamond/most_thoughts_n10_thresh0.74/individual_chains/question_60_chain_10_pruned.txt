Okay, so I've got this question about space travel and time dilation. Let's see, I need to figure out how long it takes for an astronaut to reach Earth from the Large Magellanic Cloud. The astronaut is 22 years old and the spacecraft is going at a really high speed, 0.99999987 times the speed of light. Hmm, I remember that when you go that fast, time dilation effects become significant.

Wait, the question is from the astronaut's perspective. So we're looking at proper time, right? Proper time is the time measured in the moving frame of reference, which in this case is the astronaut's ship. So I need to calculate the proper time experienced by the astronaut during the trip.

But first, how far away is the Large Magellanic Cloud? I think it's about 160,000 to 200,000 light-years away from Earth. Let me check my memory. Oh, right, maybe approximately 160,000 light-years. So the distance is about 1.6e5 light-years, but I'll double-check the exact figure if needed.

Wait, wait, the question doesn't give the distance. Oh, I thought it was a detail, but maybe it's implied. Oh, wait, no, the question is about the time from the astronaut's perspective, so maybe I don't need the exact distance but can work with the given options.

Wait, no, wait. The problem says Earth is their destination, so the distance is the distance between the Large Magellanic Cloud and Earth. Let me think, the LMC is about 163,000 light-years away. So that's the distance the ship needs to cover.

But wait, the ship is moving at 0.99999987c, which is almost the speed of light. So from Earth's frame, the time taken would be distance divided by speed. But the astronaut's time is shorter due to time dilation.

Wait, but the astronaut's frame is moving, so they experience less time. So the Earth is moving towards them at speed v, but from their perspective, the distance is contracted. So in their frame, the distance is Lorentz contracted.

Right, the Lorentz contraction formula is L = L0 * sqrt(1 - v²/c²), where L0 is the proper length (Earth-LMC distance in Earth's frame), and L is the length in the astronaut's frame.

So first, calculate the Lorentz factor gamma. Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Let's compute that.

v = 0.99999987c. So v²/c² is (0.99999987)^2. Let me compute that. Let's see, 0.99999987 squared: 0.99999987 * 0.99999987. Hmm, let's approximate it. 0.99999987 is 1 - 1.3e-6, so (1 - a)^2 ≈ 1 - 2a when a is small. So approx 1 - 2*(1.3e-6) = 1 - 2.6e-6 ≈ 0.99999974. But perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

Alternatively, using a calculator approach: v = 0.99999987c.

v²/c² = (0.99999987)^2 = approximately 0.99999974. Let me see, (1 - x)^2 ≈ 1 - 2x when x is small. So x is 1e-6 perhaps. Wait, 0.99999987 is 1 - 1.3e-6. So x is 1.3e-6.

So (1 - x)^2 ≈ 1 - 2x = 1 -2.6e-6 = 0.9999
