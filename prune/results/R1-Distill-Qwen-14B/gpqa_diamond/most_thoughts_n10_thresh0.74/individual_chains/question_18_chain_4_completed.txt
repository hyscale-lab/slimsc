Okay, so I have this problem about stellar abundances, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again carefully.

The problem says we have two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their masses are 1.5 and 1.2 times that of the Sun, respectively. Using the EW method under LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), they've determined some elemental abundances. 

The given values are:
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex

The photospheric composition of the Sun is provided as:
- 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5
- 12 + log10(nMg/nH) = 7

We need to find the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So, the question is asking for [Si/Star_1] divided by [Si/Star_2], or Si_1/Si_2? Or is it the ratio of their abundances, like Si_1 / Si_2? Hmm, probably the ratio of their abundances, so (Si_1)/(Si_2).

Let me think about the notation. The [X/Y] notation in astronomy represents the logarithm of the ratio of the abundance of element X to element Y relative to the Sun. So, [X/Y] = log10(N_X/N_Y) - log10(N_X/N_Y)_sun.

Wait, no, more accurately, [X/Y] = log10(N_X / N_Y) - log10(N_X_sun / N_Y_sun). So if [X/Y] is positive, X is more abundant relative to Y than in the Sun.

Given that, let's work out each star's elemental abundances.

First, the Sun's data:
For Fe, 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 → log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5) ≈ 3.16e-5.

Similarly, for Mg: 12 + log10(nMg/nH) =7 → log10(nMg/nH) =-5 → nMg/nH = 1e-5.

Now for Star_1:
[Fe/H]_1 = 0 → [Fe/H] = log(N_Fe / N_H) - log(N_Fe_sun / N_H_sun) ) = 0 → N_Fe / N_H = N_Fe_sun / N_H_sun. So the Fe abundance is the same as the Sun's. So for Star_1, [Fe/H] =0 → Fe/H is solar.

And [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → [Si/Fe] = 0.3. So Si/Fe in Star_1 is 10^0.3 times that in the Sun. Since [Fe/H]_1 is 0, Fe is solar. So Si is solar * 10^0.3.

Wait, let's think more carefully. [Si/Fe] = log10(N_Si / N_Fe) - log10(N_Si_sun / N_Fe_sun) ) = 0.3 → So, N_Si / N_Fe in Star_1 is 10^(0.3) times the solar ratio.

Because [Fe/H]_1 is 0, so Fe/H in Star_1 is solar. So N_Fe / N_H = N_Fe_sun / N_H_sun → N_Fe = (N_Fe_sun / N_H_sun) * N_H.

Similarly, N_Si in Star_1 is N_Si = (N_Si_sun / N_Fe_sun) * 10^0.3 * N_Fe → Let me write this down.

Alternatively, perhaps using the [X/Y] notation can help.

In Star_1:
[Fe/H] = 0 → Fe abundance is solar, so Fe/H = solar. Therefore, the abundance of Fe is the same as in the Sun.

[Si/Fe] = 0.3 → [Si/Fe] means Si is more abundant by 10^0.3 times relative to Fe compared to the Sun. So because Fe is solar, Si is 10^0.3 times the solar Si/Fe ratio. Wait, wait, that might not be the correct way to compute it.

Wait, [X/Y] = log(N_X / N_Y) - log(N_X_sun / N_Y_sun) → So in Star_1: log(Si/Fe)_1 - log(Si/Fe)_sun = 0.3 → So log(Si/Fe)_1 = 0.3 + log(Si/Fe)_sun.

So Si/Fe in Star_1 = 10^(0.3) * (Si/Fe)_sun.

But (Si/Fe)_sun is what? Well, what's the Sun's [Si/Fe]? Since it's not given, but perhaps we can compute it from the Sun's abundances.

Wait, the Sun's data is:

12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5 → log10(nFe/nH) = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 3.16e-5.

Similarly, log10(nMg/nH) = -5 → nMg/nH=1e-5.

But what about nSi/nH? Hmm, that isn't given. Oh, but perhaps we can compute [Si/Fe]_sun.

Wait, [Si/Fe]_sun would be log10(nSi/nFe) - log10(nSi_sun/nFe_sun). Wait, no, [X/Y]_sun is zero because it's the reference. Hmm, perhaps I need to figure out the solar ratios for Si/Fe.

Wait, maybe I don't need to compute the absolute abundances, but instead just find the ratio between Star_1 and Star_2.

Let me think about each star's silicon abundance relative to hydrogen, then find their ratio.

For Star_1: [Fe/H] =0 → Fe/H is solar. So Fe in Star_1 is same as Fe in Sun.

[Si/Fe]_1 =0.3 → So Si/Fe in Star_1 is 10^0.3 times solar. Because [X/Y] = log(N_X / N_Y) - log(N_X_sun / N_Y_sun) → So N_X / N_Y = 10^([X/Y]) * (N_X_sun / N_Y_sun).

So for Star_1, Si/Fe =10^0.3 * (Si/Fe)_sun.

But (Si/Fe)_sun is [Si/Fe]_sun = log10(Si_sun/Fe_sun) - log10(Si_sun/Fe_sun) )= 0 → so (Si/Fe)_sun is 1.

Wait no, that's not correct. [X/Y]_sun is zero because it's the reference. So for the Sun, [Si/Fe] would be zero. So in Star_1, [Si/Fe]_1=0.3 → Si/Fe is 10^0.3 times solar. So Si = (Fe * 10^0.3) → But wait, because in Star_1, Fe is solar. So Fe = Fe_sun. So Si_1 = Fe_sun * 10^0.3 * (Si_sun/Fe_sun) ?

Wait, perhaps I need to model the abundances in terms of [X/H], which is the logarithm of the abundance relative to H.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute [Si/H] for each star, then take the ratio.

For Star_1:

[Fe/H]_1 = 0 → (Fe/H)_1 = (Fe/H)_sun.

[Si/Fe]_1 =0.3 → [Si/Fe] = 0.3. Which is log(Si/Fe) - log(Si/Fe)_sun = 0.3 → log(Si/Fe)_1 = 0.3 + log(Si/Fe)_sun.

But (Si/Fe)_sun is [Si/Fe]_sun =0 → wait no, that's not correct. Wait, [X/Y]_sun is zero by definition. But (X/Y)_sun = 1, so log(X/Y)_sun =0.

So, for Star_1, log(Si/Fe) = 0.3 → Si/Fe = 10^0.3.

But also, Fe/H in Star_1 is solar. So Fe = (Fe/H)_sun * H. So, Si = (Si/Fe) * Fe = (10^0.3) * (Fe). Since Fe in Star_1 is solar, Fe = Fe_sun. So Si_1 = 10^0.3 * Fe_sun.

But the Sun's Si is (Si_sun) = [X/H]_sun for Si. Wait, but we don't have [Si/H]_sun given. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps we can compute the [Si/H] for each star. Because [Si/H] would directly tell us the abundance of Si relative to H.

Let me think:

For Star_1:

We have [Fe/H]_1 =0 → Fe/H = Fe_sun/H_sun.

[Si/Fe]_1 =0.3 → [Si/Fe] =0.3 → log(Si/Fe)_1 =0.3 → Si/Fe =10^0.3.

But since Fe/H is solar, we can write:

Si = (Si/Fe) * Fe → Si =10^0.3 * Fe.

But Fe in Star_1 is same as in Sun, so Fe = Fe_sun → Si = 10^0.3 * Fe_sun.

So, the ratio of Si to H in Star_1 is (Si/H)_1 = (Si/Fe) * (Fe/H)_1 =10^0.3 * (Fe_sun / H_sun).

So [Si/H]_1 = log(Si/H)_1 - log(Si/H)_sun.

log(Si/H)_1 = log(10^0.3 * (Fe_sun / H_sun)) = 0.3 + log(FE_sun / H_sun).

But log(FE_sun / H_sun) is [Fe/H]_sun, which for the Sun is zero because [Fe/H] is defined as log(N_Fe/N_H) - log(N_Fe_sun/N_H_sun), which is zero for the Sun. So [Fe/H]_sun =0.

Wait, but [Fe/H]_sun is zero. So (Fe/H)_sun =10^0 → 1.

Wait, no. Wait, [X/H] equals log(N_X/N_H) - log(N_X_sun / N_H_sun) → for the Sun, [X/H]_sun =0 → log(N_X/N_H)_sun = log(N_X_sun / N_H_sun) → which is consistent.

So, (Fe/H)_sun = 10^([Fe/H]_sun) =10^0=1.

Similarly, for Star_1, (Fe/H)_1 =10^[Fe/H]_1 =10^0=1.

So, (Si/H)_1 = (Si/Fe)_1 * (Fe/H)_1 = (10^0.3) * 1 =10^0.3.

So [Si/H]_1 = log( (Si/H)_1 ) - log( (Si/H)_sun ) = log(10^0.3) - log( (Si/H)_sun )

Wait, but we need to find (Si/H)_sun to compute [Si/H]_1.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute (Si/H)_sun using the given Sun's data. Wait, the Sun's data is given as 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5 → log10(nFe/nH)= -4.5 → nFe/nH =3.16e-5.

Similarly, for Mg, log10(nMg/nH) =-5 → nMg/nH=1e-5.

But what about nSi/nH? Hmm, perhaps I can compute [Si/Fe]_sun as log10(nSi/nFe) - log10(nSi_sun/nFe_sun). Wait, but [Si/Fe]_sun is zero. So log10(nSi/nFe)_sun = log10(nSi_sun/nFe_sun) → which is zero. So nSi/nFe =1 → nSi =nFe.

Wait, but that can't be right because in the Sun, the abundance of Fe is higher than Si. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, let's think. The Sun's [Fe/H] is zero. [Fe/H]_sun=0.

In the Sun, (Fe/H)_sun =1 → nFe/nH =1. But wait no, because the Sun's (Fe/H)_sun is 0 in log scale. Wait, no. Let me clarify:

[X/H]_sun =0 → log(n_X/n_H) - log(n_X_sun/n_H_sun) =0 → which is always true because n_X_sun/n_H_sun is what [X/H] is based on.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me approach it differently.

We need to find the ratio (Si_1)/(Si_2). So compute [Si/H]_1 and [Si/H]_2, then take the ratio.

Let me try to compute [Si/H] for each star.

Starting with Star_1:

Star_1 has [Fe/H]_1=0 → Fe/H is solar. So Fe/H =1 (since [Fe/H]=0 is log(Fe/H) - log(Fe/H_sun) =0 → Fe/H = Fe/H_sun → which is 1 because Fe/H_sun is 10^0=1).

[Si/Fe]_1 =0.3 → [Si/Fe] is 0.3. So Si/Fe =10^0.3.

But since Fe/H is 1, then Si/H = (Si/Fe) * (Fe/H) =10^0.3 *1 =10^0.3.

So [Si/H]_1 = log(Si/H)_1 - log(Si/H)_sun.

But wait, we don't know [Si/H]_sun. To find [Si/H]_1, we need log(Si/H)_1 and log(Si/H)_sun.

Wait, but perhaps we can compute [Si/H]_sun from the given data. The problem gives the Sun's data as:

12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5 → log10(nFe/nH) =-4.5 → nFe/nH =10^-4.5.

Similarly, 12 + log10(nMg/nH)=7 → log10(nMg/nH) =-5 → nMg/nH=1e-5.

But what about nSi/nH in the Sun? We don't have that. Hmm.

Wait, the problem might not require knowing the absolute abundances in the Sun but just the relative abundances between the two stars. Let me think.

Wait, another approach: perhaps express [Si/H] in terms of [Fe/H] and [Si/Fe].

Because [Si/H] = [Fe/H] + [Si/Fe].

So for Star_1: [Fe/H]_1 =0, [Si/Fe]_1=0.3 → [Si/H]_1=0 +0.3=0.3.

Similarly, for Star_2, maybe I can compute [Si/H]_2.

Wait, let's look at Star_2's data:

[Mg/Si]_2 =0.3 → [Mg/Si] is 0.3.

[Fe/H]_2 is not directly given, but [Mg/H]_2 is 0.

Wait, [Mg/H]_2 =0 → Mg/H is solar. So in Star_2, Mg/H = Mg_sun/H_sun → which is 1e-5 as per the Sun's data. Wait, no, the Sun's [Mg/H] is 12 + log10(nMg/nH) =7 → log10(nMg/nH)= -5 → nMg/nH=1e-5.

So for Star_2, [Mg/H]_2 =0 → Mg/H = solar, so Mg/H =1e-5 (same as Sun). So n_Mg =1e-5 * n_H.

But how does that relate to Si?

We have [Mg/Si]_2 =0.3 → [Mg/Si] =0.3 → log(Mg/Si)_2 - log(Mg/Si)_sun =0.3.

So log(Mg/Si)_2 =0.3 + log(Mg/Si)_sun.

But [Mg/Si]_sun is [Mg/Si] in the Sun. Let me compute that.

In the Sun:

n_Mg =1e-5 * n_H.

n_Si_sun is unknown. So n_Mg/n_Si_sun = (1e-5 * n_H) /n_Si_sun.

But [Mg/Si]_sun is log10(n_Mg/n_Si) - log10(n_Mg_sun/n_Si_sun) → which is zero because it's the Sun's ratio.

Wait, perhaps I should compute [Mg/Si]_sun using the Sun's given data.

Wait, the Sun's [Mg/H] is 7 from the given data. Wait no, the Sun's data is 12 + log10(nMg/nH) =7 → log10(nMg/nH) =-5 → nMg/nH=1e-5.

And what about [Mg/Si]_sun?

We can compute [Mg/Si]_sun = log10(n_Mg/n_Si) - log10(n_Mg_sun/n_Si_sun).

But since it's the Sun, this is zero. So log(n_Mg/n_Si) = log(n_Mg_sun/n_Si_sun) → n_Mg/n_Si = n_Mg_sun /n_Si_sun.

But without knowing n_Si_sun, perhaps this approach is stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps we can express [Si/H]_2 in terms of [Mg/Si]_2 and [Mg/H]_2.

Wait, [Mg/Si]_2 =0.3 → [Mg/Si] =0.3 → log(Mg/Si) =0.3 + log(Mg/Si)_sun.

We know that in Star_2, Mg/H = solar. So Mg/H = Mg_sun/H_sun → which is 1e-5 (as nMg/nH =1e-5 for the Sun).

So, in Star_2:

n_Mg =n_Mg_sun.

n_Si = ?

We can write Mg/Si = (Mg/H) / (Si/H) → because n_Mg/n_Si = (n_Mg/n_H) / (n_Si/n_H) ) = (n_Mg/n_H) * (n_H/n_Si) ) = (n_Mg/n_H) / (n_Si/n_H).

So [Mg/Si]_2 = log( (Mg/Si)_2 ) - log( (Mg/Si)_sun ) =0.3.

But (Mg/Si)_sun is the solar ratio. So (Mg/Si)_2 =10^0.3 * (Mg/Si)_sun.

But (Mg/Si)_2 = (Mg/H)_2 / (Si/H)_2.

Since (Mg/H)_2 is solar, (Mg/H)_2 = (Mg/H)_sun =1e-5.

So,

(Mg/Si)_2 = (1e-5) / (Si/H)_2.

But also, (Mg/Si)_2 =10^0.3 * (Mg/Si)_sun.

But (Mg/Si)_sun is (Mg/H)_sun / (Si/H)_sun.

Which can be written as:

(Mg/Si)_sun = (n_Mg/n_H)_sun / (n_Si/n_H)_sun = (n_Mg/n_Si)_sun.

But without knowing (n_Si/n_H)_sun, perhaps I'm stuck again.

Hmm, perhaps another approach. Let me express [Si/H]_2.

Wait, [Si/H]_2 can be written in terms of [Mg/Si]_2 and [Mg/H]_2.

Mg/H is solar, so [Mg/H]=0 → (Mg/H)_2 =1e-5 (same as Sun).

[Mg/Si]_2 =0.3 → [Mg/Si] =0.3 → (Mg/Si)_2 =10^0.3 * (Mg/Si)_sun.

But (Mg/Si)_sun is (Mg/H)_sun / (Si/H)_sun.

So,

(Mg/Si)_2 =10^0.3 * (Mg/H)_sun / (Si/H)_sun.

But (Mg/Si)_2 = (Mg/H)_2 / (Si/H)_2.

Substituting:

( (Mg/H)_2 ) / (Si/H)_2 ) =10^0.3 * (Mg/H)_sun / (Si/H)_sun.

But (Mg/H)_2 = (Mg/H)_sun → because [Mg/H]_2=0 → (Mg/H)_2 = (Mg/H)_sun.

So,

( (Mg/H)_sun ) / (Si/H)_2 ) =10^0.3 * (Mg/H)_sun / (Si/H)_sun.

We can cancel (Mg/H)_sun from both sides:

1/(Si/H)_2 =10^0.3 / (Si/H)_sun → (Si/H)_2 = (Si/H)_sun /10^0.3.

So [Si/H]_2 = log( (Si/H)_2 ) - log( (Si/H)_sun ) = log( (Si_sun /10^0.3) / H_sun ) - log( Si_sun / H_sun )

= log( (Si_sun / H_sun) /10^0.3 ) - log(Si_sun / H_sun )

= log( (Si_sun / H_sun) ) - log(10^0.3) - log(Si_sun / H_sun )

= -0.3 → So [Si/H]_2 = -0.3.

Wait, that can't be right because [Si/H]_2 would be negative, implying lower Si than H compared to the Sun, but I need to think carefully.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the algebra.

Wait, let's re-derive:

From earlier:

(Mg/Si)_2 = (Mg/H)_2 / (Si/H)_2.

But (Mg/Si)_2 =10^0.3 * (Mg/Si)_sun.

(Mg/Si)_sun is (Mg/H)_sun / (Si/H)_sun.

So,

(Mg/Si)_2 =10^0.3 * (Mg/Si)_sun =10^0.3 * [ (Mg/H)_sun / (Si/H)_sun ].

But (Mg/Si)_2 is also (Mg/H)_2 / (Si/H)_2.

Since (Mg/H)_2 = (Mg/H)_sun → because [Mg/H]_2=0 → (Mg/H)_2 = (Mg/H)_sun =1e-5.

So,

(1e-5) / (Si/H)_2 =10^0.3 * (1e-5) / (Si/H)_sun.

Wait, wait, no. Let me correct this.

Wait, (Mg/Si)_sun is (Mg_sun / Si_sun) = (Mg/H_sun) / (Si/H_sun) → since both Mg and Si are relative to H.

So,

(Mg/Si)_sun = (n_Mg/n_H)_sun / (n_Si/n_H)_sun = (n_Mg/n_Si)_sun.

So,

(Mg/Si)_2 =10^0.3 * (n_Mg/n_Si)_sun.

But also,

(Mg/Si)_2 = (n_Mg/n_Si)_2 = (n_Mg/n_H)_2 * (n_H/n_Si) ) = (n_Mg/n_H)_2 / (n_Si/n_H)_2.

Which is (Mg/H)_2 / (Si/H)_2.

So,

(Mg/Si)_2 = (Mg/H)_2 / (Si/H)_2 =10^0.3 * (Mg/Si)_sun.

We can write this as:

(Mg/H)_2 / (Si/H)_2 =10^0.3 * (Mg/Si)_sun.

But (Mg/H)_2 is solar, so it's equal to (Mg/H)_sun. So,

(Mg/H)_sun / (Si/H)_2 =10^0.3 * (Mg/Si)_sun.

But (Mg/Si)_sun = (Mg/H)_sun / (Si/H)_sun.

So substituting,

(Mg/H)_sun / (Si/H)_2 =10^0.3 * ( (Mg/H)_sun / (Si/H)_sun )

We can cancel (Mg/H)_sun from both sides,

1/(Si/H)_2 =10^0.3 / (Si/H)_sun.

So,

(Si/H)_2 = (Si/H)_sun / 10^0.3.

Which implies,

(Si/H)_2 = (Si/H)_sun * 10^(-0.3).

So, [Si/H]_2 = log( (Si/H)_2 ) - log( (Si/H)_sun ) = log( (Si/H)_sun *10^(-0.3) ) - log( (Si/H)_sun )

= log( (Si/H)_sun ) + log(10^(-0.3)) ) - log( (Si/H)_sun )

= (-0.3) → So [Si/H]_2 = -0.3.

Wait, that's interesting. So Star_2's [Si/H] is -0.3.

Now, for Star_1, earlier I thought [Si/H]_1 =0.3.

So the ratio of Si_1 to Si_2 is (Si_1/Si_2) = (10^([Si/H]_1) ) / (10^([Si/H]_2) ) ) = 10^(0.3 - (-0.3)) )= 10^0.6 ≈ 3.98, which is approximately 4. So the ratio is about 4, which is option A.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations.

So, for Star_1:

[Fe/H]_1=0 → Fe/H = solar.

[Si/Fe]_1=0.3 → [Si/Fe]=0.3 → Si/Fe =10^0.3.

So [Si/H]_1 = [Fe/H]_1 + [Si/Fe]_1 =0 +0.3=0.3 → So [Si/H]_1=0.3.

For Star_2:

[Mg/Si]_2=0.3 → [Mg/Si]=0.3 → Mg/Si =10^0.3 * (Mg/Si)_sun.

But [Mg/H]_2=0 → Mg/H is solar.

So, Mg/Si = (Mg/H) / (Si/H) = (Mg_sun/H_sun) / (Si_2/H_2) ) → but wait, [Mg/H]_2=0 → Mg_2/H_2 = Mg_sun/H_sun → so Mg_2 = Mg_sun * H_2 / H_sun.

But (Mg/Si)_2 = (Mg_2/Si_2) = (Mg_sun * H_2 / H_sun ) / Si_2.

But this is getting complicated. Alternatively, using the earlier approach, I found that [Si/H]_2 is -0.3.

So the ratio is 10^(0.3 - (-0.3)) =10^0.6≈3.98.

So the ratio of Star_1's Si to Star_2's Si is approximately 4, which is option A (~3.9).


To determine the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2, we analyze their elemental abundances using the given data:

### Key Data:
1. **Star_1**:
   - [Fe/H]_1 = 0 → Fe/H is solar.
   - [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → Si/Fe = \(10^{0.3}\) times solar.

2. **Star_2**:
   - [Mg/H]_2 = 0 → Mg/H is solar.
   - [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 → Mg/Si = \(10^{0.3}\) times solar.

3. **Sun's Photospheric Composition**:
   - \(12 + \log_{10}(n_{\text{Fe}}/n_{\text{H}}) = 7.5 \implies \log_{10}(n_{\text{Fe}}/n_{\text{H}}) = -4.5\).
   - \(12 + \log_{10}(n_{\text{Mg}}/n_{\text{H}}) = 7 \implies \log_{10}(n_{\text{Mg}}/n_{\text{H}}) = -5\).

### Analysis:
#### For Star_1:
- Since [Fe/H]_1 = 0, Fe/H is solar. Thus, Fe in Star_1 is the same as in the Sun.
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 implies Si/Fe = \(10^{0.3}\) times solar. Therefore, Si in Star_1 is \(10^{0.3}\) times the solar Si abundance relative to Fe.
- Using the relationship \([X/H] = [X/Y] + [Y/H]\), we compute:
  \[
  [\text{Si/H}]_1 = [\text{Si/Fe}]_1 + [\text{Fe/H}]_1 = 0.3 + 0 = 0.3
  \]

#### For Star_2:
- Since [Mg/H]_2 = 0, Mg/H is solar. Thus, Mg in Star_2 is the same as in the Sun.
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 implies Mg/Si = \(10^{0.3}\) times solar. Therefore, Si in Star_2 is \(10^{-0.3}\) times the solar Si abundance relative to Mg.
- Using the relationship \([X/H] = [X/Y] + [Y/H]\), we compute:
  \[
  [\text{Si/H}]_2 = [\text{Si/Mg}]_2 + [\text{Mg/H}]_2 = -0.3 + 0 = -0.3
  \]

#### Ratio of Silicon Abundances:
The ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 to Star_2 is given by:
\[
\frac{\text{Si}_1}{\text{Si}_2} = \frac{10^{[\text{Si/H}]_1}}{10^{[\text{Si/H}]_2}} = 10^{[\text{Si/H}]_1 - [\text{Si/H}]_2}
\]
Substituting the values:
\[
\frac{\text{Si}_1}{\text{Si}_2} = 10^{0.3 - (-0.3)} = 10^{0.6} \approx 3.98
\]

### Conclusion:
The ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2 is approximately **3.9**.
