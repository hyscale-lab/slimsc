Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem in front of me. It's about sigmatropic rearrangements, which I remember are a type of pericyclic reaction. From what I learned, sigmatropic rearrangements involve the shift of a sigma bond along with a pi bond. I think the general form is like [i,j] sigmatropic rearrangement where i and j are the positions moving.

The question has three reactions to complete, and I need to figure out the products A, B, and C based on the given starting materials. The options are A, B, C, D, each providing different structures for A, B, and C.

Let me break it down reaction by reaction.

First Reaction: 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine + but-3-en-2-ol + (H+ + Heat) â†’ A.

Wait, that starting material seems a bit complex. Let me write out the structures. 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine would be (CH3O)2CH-NH2. But wait, no, ethan-1-amine is CH2NH2, but with two methoxy groups on the same carbon as the amine. So structure is OMe-C(CH2NH2)(OMe). Hmm, maybe I should draw it:

Structure: (CH3O)2CCH2NH2? No, wait, ethanamine is CH3CH2NH2, but 1-position is the CH2NH2. So 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine would be CH2(OCH3)2NH2. Wait, that can't be right because ethanamine is two carbons, so maybe it's (OCH3)2CH-NH2? Wait, no, that would be 2-methoxypropanamine or something. Maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps it's H2N-C(CH2OCH3)2? No, perhaps I should think of it as CH2(OCH3)2NH2. But maybe it's more accurately (HOCH2)2OCH2NH2? No, perhaps not. Alternatively, maybe the structure is (HOCH2)2N(CH2OCH3)2. Wait, that's not making sense. Alternatively, perhaps it's a geminal di-ethoxy group on
