Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but let me try to work through it step by step. The question is about finding the pH of a solution made by mixing three different solutions: acetic acid, hydrochloric acid, and barium hydroxide. Hmm, sounds a bit complicated, but maybe I can break it down.

First, I remember that when you mix acids and bases, they can neutralize each other. Acetic acid is a weak acid, HCl is a strong acid, and Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. So, I think the first thing to do is to figure out how much of each H+ and OH- are present in the mixture.

Let me jot down the given data:

- 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH (acetic acid)
- 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl (strong acid)
- 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2 (strong base)

Wait, but wait. I think I should calculate the moles of each acid and base first. Because when they mix, the strong acid and strong base will react first, right? And then any excess will determine the pH.

So, let me compute the moles for each component.

For CH3COOH:
Molarity (M) = moles / liters. So, moles = M * L. But wait, 500 mL is 0.5 liters. So 0.1 M * 0.5 L = 0.05 moles of CH3COOH.

For HCl:
It's a strong acid, so it dissociates completely. 400 mL is 0.4 L. Moles HCl = 0.2 * 0.4 = 0.08 moles. Since HCl is H+ and Cl-, each mole gives one mole of H+.

For Ba(OH)2:
Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. Each mole gives two OH- ions. So, 300 mL is 0.3 L. Moles Ba(OH)2 = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles. So, OH- is 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

Wait, wait. So, the H+ comes from HCl and the strong acid, and OH- comes from Ba(OH)2. But wait, the acetic acid is a weak acid; it doesn't dissociate completely. So maybe it doesn't contribute much to the H+ in the initial neutralization. Or does it? Hmm, perhaps in the neutralization reaction, the strong acid and strong base will react first, and then the weak acid's H+ will be considered.

So, the initial reaction would be between H+ (from HCl) and OH- (from Ba(OH)2). Let's calculate the moles.

Moles of H+ from HCl: 0.08 mol.
Moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2: 0.18 mol.

When H+ and OH- react, they form water:

H+ + OH- â†’ H2O.

So, the H+ will be neutralized by OH-.

Now, which is in excess? Let's see the amounts.

H+ has 0.08, OH- has 0.18. So, OH- is more. So, after neutralization, all 0.08 H+ will be consumed, and there will be excess OH-.

The excess OH- is 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 mol.

Wait, but wait. Because Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, all the OH- is available for reaction.

So, after the HCl and Ba(OH)2 react, we have 0.10 moles of OH- left. But wait, what about the acetic acid? Because after this neutralization, the solution will have a lot of OH- (since excess OH-), but the ac
