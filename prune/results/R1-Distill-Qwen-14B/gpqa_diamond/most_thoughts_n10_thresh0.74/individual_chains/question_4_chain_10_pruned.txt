Okay, so I've got this physics question about Maxwell's equations in a parallel universe where magnets can have isolated North or South poles. Hmm, that's interesting. I remember that in our universe, magnets always have both poles; you can't isolate a single pole. But how does that affect Maxwell's equations?

Wait, Maxwell's equations describe how electric and magnetic fields propagate, interact, and how they're generated by charges and currents. The four equations are about divergence of E, curl of E, divergence of B, and curl of B. 

In our universe, one of the equations says that the divergence of B is zero. That's because magnetic monopoles don't exist. So div B = 0. If a universe has magnetic monopoles, then this equation must change, right? Because div B wouldn't be zero anymore. So the first equation that changes is the one about the divergence of the magnetic field.

Wait, but wait, there are other equations too. The other equations might not change. Let me think. The other equations are:

1. Gauss's Law forElectricity: divergence of E equals rho/epsilon0.
2. Faraday's Law: curl of E equals - dB/dt.
3. Gauss's Law for Magnetism: divergence of B is zero.
4. Ampère's Law: curl of B equals mu0 J + displacement current.

In a universe with isolated monopoles, the third equation (divergence of B) would not be zero. So that equation would change. But what about the other equations?

Faraday's Law—would that change? I don't think so. Because Faraday's Law relates the changing B field to the curl of E. As long as B can have sources (monopoles), Faraday's Law might need to change. Oh wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again.

Wait, in our universe, if you have a monopole, it's a point source for the magnetic field. So the divergence of B would be proportional to the density of the monopole. So equation 3 would no longer be zero. But what about equation 4, Ampère's Law? In our universe, Ampère's Law doesn't include monopoles because they don't exist. But when you have monopoles, you might need an additional term.

Wait, Maxwell's equations are symmetric in a way when considering monopoles. So perhaps adding a magnetic charge density would modify both the divergence of B and
