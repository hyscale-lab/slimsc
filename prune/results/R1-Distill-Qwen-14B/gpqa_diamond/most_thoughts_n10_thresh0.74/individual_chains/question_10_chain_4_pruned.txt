Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and their densities. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my planetary science, but let's try to think it through.

The question is asking which of the given exoplanets has the highest density. There are four options, a to d, and the answers are A to D. Each option describes a planet with certain characteristics. I need to figure out the density of each and compare.

First, I remember that density is mass divided by volume. So density = mass/volume. Since all these planets are compared to Earth, I can probably use Earth's mass and radius as a starting point.

Let's go through each option one by one.

Option a: An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet. Oh, that's straightforward. This planet has the same mass and radius as Earth. So its density would be Earth's density. I think Earth's density is about 5.5 g/cm³ because Earth is made of rock and metal. So this planet's density is 5.5 g/cm³.

Option b: A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³. Wait, that's interesting. The density is given here as 5.5, same as Earth. But the mass is double. Wait, but if mass is 2 Earth masses, and density is same, then the volume must be different. Because density is mass/volume. So, if density is same, then volume should be 2 times Earth's volume, because mass is doubled. Wait, but wait, volume scales with the cube of radius. So if the radius is larger, the volume increases. But in this case, the density is the same as Earth. So I don't think this option's density is higher than Earth's, it's the same.

Wait, but the question is about which has the highest density. So if option b's density is 5.5, same as Earth, then it's not higher than a. Unless I'm misunderstanding the question.

Wait, let me read option b again. The planet has 2 Earth masses and a density of about 5.5. So that's the given density. So yeah, its density is 5.5, same as Earth. So it's same as option a.

Option c: A planet with same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive. Oh, same composition as Earth means same density as Earth, right? Because composition dictates density. So
