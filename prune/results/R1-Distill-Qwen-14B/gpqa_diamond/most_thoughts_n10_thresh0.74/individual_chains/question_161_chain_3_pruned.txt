Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this electron microscopy question. Let me read it carefully.

Mike is working with a high-resolution transmission electron microscope. He's using a really high accelerating voltage, 1000 kV. To get a good image, he needs a vacuum because any gas molecules can scatter the electrons, right? So he uses vacuum pumps to create an ultra-high vacuum with pressure less than 10^-9 Torr. But even then, some gas particles are still there, as detected by a mass spectrometer.

He calculated the mean free path of these gas molecules as λ1. The mean free path depends on factors like pressure, temperature, and the size of the molecules. Wait, the mean free path is the average distance a molecule travels between collisions. So in a vacuum, but not perfect, the gas molecules are spread out, so the mean free path is longer.

But then, when he starts the electron beam, he notices that the mean free path changes. It's now λ2, and it's different from λ1. The temperature is the same, so that shouldn't affect it. So why would λ change?

Hmm, what factors affect the mean free path? From what I remember, the mean free path (λ) is given by λ = (k*T)/(√2 * π * d² * P), where k is Boltzmann's constant, T is temperature, d is the diameter of the molecules, and P is pressure. Or wait, another formula I've heard is λ = (1) / (n * π * d² / 2), where n is the number density. But I might be mixing up the exact formula.

Wait, another way: The mean free path can also be expressed in terms of pressure and temperature. Oh right, because at a certain temperature, the mean velocity of the molecules affects how often they collide. But in this case, the temperature is constant, so if the pressure changes, how does that affect λ?

Wait, but in the scenario, the pressure hasn't changed because the vacuum pumps are running, and the pressure is still <10^-9 Torr. But when the electron beam is on, perhaps the gas molecules are ionized or something? Because electrons are high-energy, they might knock out electrons from the gas molecules, causing them to become charged.

If the gas molecules become ions, their behavior would change. Because ions interact differently with the electrons in the beam. Also, charged particles would behave under electric
