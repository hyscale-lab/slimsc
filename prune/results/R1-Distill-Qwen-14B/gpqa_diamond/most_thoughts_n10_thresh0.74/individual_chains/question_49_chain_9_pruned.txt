Okay, I've got this chemistry problem here about sigmatropic rearrangements. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

So, the question has three parts (A, B, C) and four options. I need to figure out which option correctly matches each product. Let's take each reaction one by one.

First, reaction 1: 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine + but-3-en-2-ol with H+ and heat gives A.

Hmm, I remember that sigmatropic rearrangements involve the movement of a pi bond. The Cope and Claisen rearrangements are examples. Wait, Claisen is for allyl vinyl ethers, right? And Cope for 1,5-dienes.

But looking at the reactants here: 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine. That structure is like a molecule where ethan-1-amine has two methoxy groups on the same carbon. So, the structure is (CH3O)2CH-NH2. And but-3-en-2-ol is CH2=CHCH2OH.

Wait, but the reaction is under H+ and heat. So, maybe it's forming some sort of cyclic intermediate. Is this a case of an aminal or something else?

Wait, another thought: when H+ is added, maybe the alcohol (but-3-en-2-ol) gets protonated. Then, maybe the amine acts as a nucleophile. Or perhaps it's forming an enamine, which could undergo a rearrangement.

Alternatively, could this be some sort of condensation reaction? The amine and the alcohol could form an acetal or something similar.

Wait, wait. Another approach: the starting material, 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine, is an ethanamine with two methoxy groups. When combined with but-3-en-2-ol, which is a secondary alcohol, perhaps under acidic conditions, there's a cyclization.

I think the Claisen rearrangement typically involves an allyl vinyl ether. So, if the amine is somehow acting as a base, maybe it's facilitating the formation of a cyclic ether or something.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is forming an oxaziridine or something similar. Alternatively, maybe it's a ring-closing via a hemiacetal or something.

Wait, but let me think about the product options. Looking at option A, product A is 6-methyl-3,4-dihydro-2H-pyran-2-amine. That's a six-membered ring with a pyran structure (like a cyclic ether with a ring), with an amine group.

Another option for A is (Z)-1-(but-2-en-2-yloxy)ethen-1-amine.

Hmm, so perhaps the initial reaction forms a cyclic aminal via a rearrangement. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Claisen-like rearrangement.

Wait, but wait. The starting material has two methoxy groups on the same carbon attached to the amine. Maybe under H+ and heat, one of the methoxy groups leaves, forming a carbocation? Or perhaps the amine isn't leaving but the other groups rearrange.

Wait, perhaps the 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine is reacting with but
