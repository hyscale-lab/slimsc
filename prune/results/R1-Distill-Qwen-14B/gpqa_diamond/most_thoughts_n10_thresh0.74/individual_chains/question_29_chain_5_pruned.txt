Okay, so I have this genetics question about barley and some mutations. Let me read through it carefully.

The situation is that there's this drought-resistant barley cultivar, but it has an anti-nutritional compound. The gene responsible for making that compound has five exons and four introns. The plan is to use EMS mutagenesis to create mutants and see which mutation would eliminate the compound.

The intact gene sequence is given, and each mutant has some changes in the first exon. The question is which mutation would most likely get rid of the anti-nutritional compound. So, I think this has to do with disrupting the gene so it doesn't produce the compound anymore. Maybe a frameshift or a nonsense mutation?

Looking at the options, I need to find which mutant has a mutation that disrupts the gene's function. Let me look at each mutant's sequence compared to the intact gene.

The intact gene starts with 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’.

Mutant 1: 5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Looking at the beginning: ATGTTTCTCGCT... becomes ATGTTCTACGCT...

Wait, let me compare each nucleotide. Intact: positions maybe 4-7? Wait, let's count.
Wait, maybe it's better to see where the changes are.

In the intact gene, the first part is ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’.
Mutant 1: ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Looking at the first part: ATG TTCT ACGC TGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC...

Wait, I think the original is ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT... So the first part is ATGTTTCTCGCTGG.

Mutant1: ATGTTCTACGCTGG. So maybe the sequence changed from TTCTCGCT to TTCTACGC? Or maybe the change is in a different spot.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compare each base:

Intact gene: positions 4-8: T T C T C
Mutant1: positions 4-8: T C T A C?

Wait, maybe not. Let me think. The first part after ATG is TTTCTC... Let me see:

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA...
Mutant1: ATG TCT AC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA...

Wait, the mutant 1 sequence in the first part is ATG TCT ACG C. So it's changed from TTTCTC GCT to TCTACGC.

So, in the original gene, at position 4,5,6,7,
