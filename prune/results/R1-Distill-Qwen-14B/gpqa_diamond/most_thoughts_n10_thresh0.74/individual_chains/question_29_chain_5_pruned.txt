Okay, so I've got this genetics question here about barley and some mutants. Let me try to figure it out step by step. So the question is about a drought-resistant barley cultivar that has an anti-nutritional compound. The problem is that this compound makes it unusable for food. They found the gene responsible, which has five exons and four introns. They used EMS mutagenesis to create mutants and now they're looking at the gene sequences.

The goal is to find which mutation would eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. That probably means they need to disrupt the gene's function, right? So the gene must be producing the compound, so if the gene is non-functional, the compound won't be made, solving the problem.

Looking at the sequences provided, the wild type and four mutants. The wild type is:

5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Each mutant has a change in the beginning of the first exon. So the first exon is probably the start of the gene.

Let me look at each mutant's sequence and see where the changes are.

Mutant 1:
5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

Comparing to wild type, the first few bases are different. Let's see:

Wild type starts with ATGTTT, and mutant 1 has ATGTTCT... Hmm, wait, let me count.

Wait, the first part of wild type is ATGTTTCTCGCTGG...

Mutant 1: ATGTTCTACGCTGG...

So looking at bases 4-6 in the wild type: TTT. In mutant 1, it's TCT. So the third base is changed from T to C. So that's a point mutation.

Mutant 2:
5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

Looking at the beginning: ATGTTCTAA... Wildtype is ATGTTTCTC. So the sixth base in wildtype is T, here it's A. Wait, maybe I should line them up.

Wild type first part:
ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

Mutant 2:
ATG TCT TAA GCT GGT ACT TCT... So in the first few codons, the second codon (TTT in wild) becomes TCT in mutant 2? Or perhaps I'm miscounting.

Wait, perhaps the first part is more accurately:

Wild type: positions 1-20 maybe:

1: ATG
2: TTT
3: CTC
4: GCT
5: GGT
6: ACT
7: TCT
8: GTG
9: GAT...

Mutant2: ATG TCT TAA GCT GGT ACT... So at position 2, TTT becomes TCT. Then position 3, CTC becomes TAA? Or maybe I'm getting the positions wrong.

Wait, perhaps I should just compare each base.

Wild type: positions 1-20: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

Mutant 1: ATG TCT ACG C GCT GGT ACT... Hmm, not sure. Maybe I need a better approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the idea is that certain mutations would disrupt the gene's function. Let's think about what kind of mutations would do that.

Point mutations can cause missense or nonsense mutations. A nonsense mutation creates a stop codon, which would truncate the protein. Missense changes an amino acid. If the gene is for a compound, disrupting the protein could stop production.

So looking for a mutation that introduces a stop codon early in the gene.

Alternatively, perhaps a frameshift mutation would change a lot of the downstream codons, possibly creating a stop early.

Looking at the mutants:

Mutant 1: The change is in the first exon. The first few codons are:

Wild: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

Mutant1: ATG TCT ACG
