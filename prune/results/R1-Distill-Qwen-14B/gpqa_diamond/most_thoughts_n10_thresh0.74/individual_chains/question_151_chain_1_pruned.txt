Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let's see. The question is about finding the probability of measuring a certain observable and getting a specific outcome. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

Alright, the system's state at time t is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, does that mean it's a 3x1 vector? Because the observable P is a 3x3 matrix. So the state is a three-dimensional vector, right.

The observable P has elements in the first row as (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0), the second row as (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), and the third row as (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). Let me write that down:

P = [
[0, 1/√2, 0],
[1/√2, 0, 1/√2],
[0, 1/√2, 0]
]

Wait, I should note that P is a Hermitian matrix since it's an observable, right? Because Hermitian matrices have real eigenvalues, which correspond to possible measurement outcomes.

The problem asks for the probability that measuring P yields 0. So I need to find the eigenvalues of P and see if 0 is one of them, and then find the corresponding eigenvector. The probability would be the square of the amplitude of that eigenvector in the given state.

Alternatively, maybe there's a
