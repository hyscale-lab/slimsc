Okay, I need to answer this multiple-choice question about which physical theory never requires regularization at high energies. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

The question gives four options: Superstring Theory, Quantum Chromodynamics, Quantum Electrodynamics, and Classical Electrodynamics. I remember that regularization is a technique used in quantum field theories to deal with divergences or infinities that pop up in calculations. Regularization helps make the theory mathematically manageable by introducing a temporary cutoff or some other method to handle these infinities, which are then canceled or absorbed somehow.

So, the key here is to figure out which of these theories doesn't need regularization. Let's go through each option.

Option A is Superstring Theory. I think string theory is a quantum theory, so it deals with similar issues as other quantum field theories. But wait, string theory is supposed to be a theory of quantum gravity and is background-independent, right? Or does it still require regularization? I'm a bit fuzzy on that. I recall that string theory might inherently avoid some of the divergences because it's a different approach to quantum mechanics. But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe it doesn't need regularization because it's a different framework.

Option B is Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). QCD is the theory of the strong interaction. I remember that QCD calculations often involve dealing with things like renormalization. Because the coupling constant becomes strong at high energies (asymptotic freedom), does that mean they need regularization? Well, regularization is a part of the renormalization process, so yes, QCD requires regularization. So B is not the correct answer.

Option C is Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). QED is the theory of electromagnetism and is a well-understood quantum field theory. I know that QED requires renormalization, which involves regularization. Because when you calculate loop diagrams, you get divergent integrals that need to be handled. So regularization is definitely needed here. So C is not the answer.

Option D is Classical Electrodynamics. Classical theories, like electromagnetism, don't have the same issues as quantum theories because they don't involve the same kind of infinities that come from quantum fluctuations. Wait, but in classical E&M, you do have things like the self-energy of charges, which leads to issues like the infinite charge density of a point charge. So in classical physics, do you need regularization? Or is regularization a quantum field theory concept? I think classical theories can sometimes have divergences, but they handle them differently, perhaps through renormalization in a classical sense. But the question is about which theory never requires regularization. Wait, the question is about when you go to high energies. Hmm.

Wait, but the question is about which theory never requires regularization. If a theory is free of such divergences, then it wouldn't need regularization. Let me think about each option again.

In QED and QCD, you definitely have divergences, so they need regularization. So options B and C are out. String theory (A) is a quantum theory, but I've heard that it doesn't have the same kind of divergences as in QFT because it's formulated with extended objects. Wait, but I'm not certain. Or does string theory require regularization in its perturbative calculations? I think that in superstring theory, when you calculate loop diagrams, especially in
