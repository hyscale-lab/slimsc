Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these concepts. But let's take it step by step.

The question is about the index of hydrogen deficiency of a product formed after a reaction. The compound given is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Hmm, that's a mouthful. I need to figure out what happens when this compound reacts with red phosphorus and excess HI.

Wait, red phosphorus and HI... Oh, right! That's the reaction where phosphorus is used to remove double bonds. I remember something about it being related to the hydrolysis of certain functional groups. Oh wait, no, more accurately, I think this is a reaction that converts alkenes to alkanes by adding hydrogen iodide. Or wait, maybe it's a type of dehydrohalogenation or something else. No, wait, red phosphorus is often used in the Wolff-Kishner reaction, but that's for removing carbonyl groups. Or was that with NH2NH2 and heat?

Wait, another thought: when you have an alkyne and you treat it with red phosphorus and HI, the alkyne gets converted into an alkane. Because the alkyne (triple bond) becomes a single bond. Oh right, that's the reaction where triple bonds are hydrogenated. So red phosphorus with HI is used for triple bonds, but what about double bonds?

Wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. So, the reagent is red phosphorus and excess HI. I think this is the reaction that converts alkynes to alkanes. Because when you have an alkyne, say R-Câ‰¡C-R', and you treat it with red phosphorus and HI, the triple bond becomes a single bond. So you end up with R-CH2-CH2-R'. Because the alkyne gets fully hydrogenated, adding two H's across each triple bond.

But wait, the compound in the question has a cyclohexene ring with substituents. Let me draw the structure to visualize this.

The compound is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. So the cyclohexene ring has double bonds at position 3. Let's number the cyclohexene ring: position 1, 2, 3, etc. So position 3 is where the double bond is. Then,
