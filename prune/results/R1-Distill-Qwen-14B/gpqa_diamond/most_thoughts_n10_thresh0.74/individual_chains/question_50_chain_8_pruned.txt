Okay, so I've got this question about quantum field theory and Feynman diagrams. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on regularization and loop diagrams, but let me think this through.

The question says my colleague has a Feynman diagram with a "size estimate" written next to it. The expression is α³ * g² * sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4π)^6 * (Q/M)^2. I need to figure out how many loops the diagram has based on this expression.

Wait, Feynman diagrams and loop integrals... Oh right, the number of loops in a Feynman diagram is related to the complexity of the integral and the factors involved. Each loop typically contributes a certain number of integrals or factors, especially in terms of energy scales and coupling constants.

I remember that in loop calculations, the general form of a loop integral is something like (E)^d, where E is an energy scale and d depends on the number of loops. Also, higher loops mean more powers of the coupling constants and more factors from the integrals.

Looking at the given expression: α³ * g² * sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4π)^6 * (Q/M)^2.

Let me break down each part:

- α is the fine-structure constant. It usually comes from photon vertices or similar interactions. In QED, each photon vertex brings a factor of e, which is related to α (since α ≈ e²/(4π)).
- g is another coupling constant, perhaps from a non-Abelian gauge theory like QCD.
- sqrt(2) and 8 are numerical factors, maybe from group theory or combinatorial factors in the diagram.
- The 1/(4π)^6 term: that's a big clue. I remember that loop integrals often come with factors of 4π from the integration in momentum space. Each loop contributes a factor of (something)/(4π)^n, where n is the number of loops. Wait, no, more accurately, each loop might contribute a 1/(4π)^d term where d is the loop order? Or maybe it's more about the dimensionality.

Wait, the integral in a loop diagram typically has an integral over d^d k, where d is the spacetime dimension. But the question is in four dimensions, so d=4. For a loop integral, the integral might include terms like ∫d^4k/(k^2 - m^2 + iε), but when you regularize it (like dimensional regularization or cutoff regularization), the result might have factors involving 1/(16π²) per loop for each loop. Because in 4 dimensions, each loop integral in a Feynman diagram usually brings a factor of 1/(16π²) (or (4π)^{-d/2} when using dimensional regularization for d loops? Hmm, not exactly sure.

Wait, for a one-loop diagram, the integral often gives a result proportional to (1/(16π²))^L, where L is the number of loops. So each loop contributes a 1/(16π²) factor. Let me check: 1/(4π)^6. Let's compute (1/(4π))^6. 4π to the sixth power. Wait, 1/(4π)^6 is the same
