Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it's about identifying a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound based on its IR and NMR spectra. The options are four different chemical formulas, and I need to figure out which one is correct.

Alright, so starting with the IR spectrum. The problem states that there are peaks indicating an ester group. Esters typically show strong absorption around 1720-1750 cm⁻¹ due to the carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So the presence of an ester means the compound has an ester functional group. That makes me think of structures like methyl benzoate or something similar, but since it's di-substituted, there are two substituents on the aromatic ring.

Now the NMR part. The 1H NMR shows six signals. Let me parse this. Two aromatic H signals, two vinyl H, two methyl groups. No CH2 signals. Wait, so what does that mean structurally?

Let me break it down. The aromatic ring is di-substituted. The two aromatic protons probably come from symmetry or substitution patterns. For a 6-membered ring like benzene, di-substituted can be para, meta, or ortho. But the NMR signals tell me something about the substituents.

The two vinyl H signals: one is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets. Vinyl protons are on double bonds, like in alkenes. So maybe there are two different sets of vinyl protons. For example, in a substituent like an ester group attached via an ethenyl (vinyl) group. Wait, or perhaps the substituent is an ester with a vinyl group attached. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: if the substituent is an ester, like OCOOR, perhaps attached via a chain. Alternatively, maybe the substituents are ester groups themselves. But wait, it's di-substituted, so two substituents on the ring. One could be an ester, and the other something else. Or both substituents are ester groups? But the NMR shows only two methyl groups. Let me think about that.

Wait, the NMR mentions two signals for –CH3 groups. How many CH3 groups are in the structure? Two, each giving a singlet unless split by neighboring protons. But wait, the problem states each –CH3 has a signal. So two different CH3 groups. But in a typical ester group, like methyl benzoate, the ester is OMe (CH3O), so there's one CH3. Unless the substituent has another methyl group. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the substituents are groups that each have a CH3. For example, if one substituent is an ester (like OCO2Me) and another substituent is a methyl group. But wait, no, because a methyl group attached directly to the ring would give a singlet in NMR. But if the substituent is a vinyl group with an ester, perhaps.

Wait, let's think about the possible structures. The aromatic ring is di-substituted. One substituent is an ester group, perhaps. Another substituent could be a vinyl group attached to something else.
