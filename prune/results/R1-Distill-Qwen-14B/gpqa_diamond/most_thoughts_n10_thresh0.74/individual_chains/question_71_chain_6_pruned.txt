Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question says that there are five exoplanets discovered using the TTV method. TTV stands for transit timing variation, right? But I'm not sure if that's relevant here. The key point is that they're in orbital resonance with periods in a ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. So, each planet's orbital period is a multiple of the first one. For example, Planet_2 has a period twice that of Planet_1, Planet_3 is 2.5 times, and so on.

The main question is about the equilibrium temperatures of Planet_4 and Planet_2. They have the same albedo, so that factor is out of the equation. Equilibrium temperature depends on the star's luminosity and the planet's distance from the star. But wait, since all these planets are around the same star (I think that's implied), the luminosity factor is the same for all. So the ratio of their temperatures would depend on their distances.

I remember the formula for equilibrium temperature is T = T_star * ( (L / (16πσd²) )^(1/4) ) or something like that. Wait, maybe more accurately, the equilibrium temperature (assuming a blackbody) is given by T = T_eff * ( (R / (2a) ) )^(-0.5) ) * ( (1 - albedo) )^0.25, where T_eff is the star's effective temperature, R is the star's radius, a is the planet's orbital semi-major axis. But since all planets are around the same star, T_eff and R are the same for all. Albedo is same, so (1 - albedo) is the same too. So the only thing that matters is the distance 'a'.

Wait, but the formula I remember is the equilibrium temperature T scales as ( (L / (16πσ a²) ) )^(1/4), where L is the star's luminosity. Alternatively, since L is the same for all, the ratio of temperatures would be inversely proportional to the square root of the ratio of their semi-major axes. So T1/T2 = sqrt( (a2/a1) )^(-1/2) ? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, the formula for equilibrium
