Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question in front of me. Hmm, let me try to think through it. The question is about two quantum states with different energies, E1 and E2, and their lifetimes. The lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds. We need to find the energy difference between them so that they can be clearly resolved. The options are A to D, each with different values.

Wait, I remember that the lifetime of an energy level is related to the uncertainty principle. Oh right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. The uncertainty in energy multiplied by the uncertainty in time is on the order of ħ/2, maybe? So the formula I think is ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2.

Here, Δt would be the lifetime of the state, because that's the time it exists before decaying or something. So for each state, the uncertainty in energy ΔE is about ħ divided by (2 times the lifetime). But wait, since we have two different lifetimes, maybe each state has its own uncertainty.

But wait, the question is about the energy difference between E2 and E1. Let me think. So the energy levels have their own lifetimes. The energy difference must be sufficiently large so that the lines don't overlap when measured. How does the uncertainty in energy affect the ability to resolve them?

Oh, I think the idea is that if the energy difference between the two states is much larger than the uncertainties in their energies, then we can distinguish them. Otherwise, if the energy difference is smaller than the uncertainties, they might blend together and we can't tell them apart.

So for each state, the uncertainty in energy is ΔE_i = ħ/(2 τ_i), where τ_i is the lifetime of state i.

So for state 1, τ1 is 1e-9 seconds. Let me calculate ΔE1. And for state 2, τ2 is 1e-8 seconds, so ΔE2.

But wait, the energy difference ΔE between E2 and E1 would be E2 - E1. Let's call that ΔE. For us to resolve them, this ΔE must be larger than the sum of the individual uncertainties, right? Because if the energy difference is smaller than the combined uncertainties, the peaks would overlap.

So the condition is ΔE > ΔE1 + ΔE2?

Wait, let me think again. The uncertainty in E for each state is about their own energy. So the energy difference between the two would need to be larger than the sum of their uncertainties to be resolvable. Otherwise, their spectral lines would be too close together and not distinguishable.

So let's compute ΔE1 and ΔE2.

The reduced Planck constant ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s. But since the options are in eV, perhaps I should convert that into eV·seconds.

I know that 1 eV is 1.602e-19 joules. So let me compute ħ in units of eV·s.

ħ = 1.0545718e-34 J·s
So converting to eV·s: ħ = 1.0545718e-34 J·s * (1 eV / 1.602e-19 J) ≈ 6.582e-16 eV·s.

So ħ ≈ 6.582e-16 eV·s.

Now, let's compute ΔE1 = ħ/(2 τ1). τ1 is 1e-9 s.

ΔE1 = (6.582e-16 eV·s) / (2 * 1e-9 s) = (6.582e-16) / (2e-9) = (6.582 / 2) * 1e-7 = 3.291e-7 eV.

Wait, 6.582e-16 divided by 2e-9 is 6.582/(2) * 1e-7, because 1e-16 / 1e-9 is 1e-7. So 3.291e-7 eV.

Similarly, ΔE2 = ħ/(2 τ2) = (6.582e-16)/(2 * 1e-8) = (6.582e-16)/(2e-
