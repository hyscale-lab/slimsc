Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me see what the question is asking.

The question is about identifying an unknown compound using its FTIR and 1H NMR spectra. The options are four different structures, all of which look similar but with varying substituents. I need to figure out which one matches the spectral data provided.

First, the FTIR data says there's a very broad peak around 3000 cm⁻¹ and a strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹. I remember that broad peaks around 3000 usually indicate O-H stretching, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. The strong peak at 1700 is probably a carbonyl group (C=O). Now, carboxylic acids have both a carbonyl and an -OH group, which fits the broad peak. So the compound is likely a carboxylic acid. Looking at the options, all of them end with COOH, so that checks out.

Next, the 1H NMR information says there are several peaks, none corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. That means there are no double bonds or triple bonds with adjacent hydrogens, so the structure isn't something like an alkene or alkyne. All options here seem to have only single bonds, so that shouldn't be an issue.

In the NMR, one signal is a doublet of triplets of quartets, and another is a doublet of triplets of triplets. Hmm, that sounds pretty complex. I think this has to do with the splitting of the NMR signals based on neighboring hydrogens. Let me think about how splitting works. Each neighboring set of equivalent protons splits the signal into a multiplet. For example, if a proton has two neighboring groups with 2 and 3 neighboring protons respectively, the splitting would be more complex.

Looking at the structures:

Option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH
So the structure is something like CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2COOH. The central C's each have two substituents: a CH3 and a C2H5 group. Wait, no, looking again: the central carbons. Let me parse it correctly. It's more like:

CH3-CH2-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2COOH? No, wait, the formula is CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH. So the structure is:

CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2COOH.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me structure it properly. The formula is CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH, which would be:

The molecule is CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2COOH. So the two middle carbons each have a CH3 and a C2H5, but wait, no. Wait, each of those middle carbons is connected to another group.

Wait, perhaps it's:

CH3-CH2-C(CH2CH3)(H)-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2COOH? Hmm, maybe I should draw it out mentally. Alternatively, maybe each of those middle carbons has two substituents: one CH3 and one C2H5, but wait, each is attached to a CH2CH3 group.

Wait, perhaps the molecule is:

The central part is two geminal substituents on each of two adjacent carbons. Let me see. For example, each of the two middle carbons has a CH3 and a C2H5 group attached? Or, wait, the structure might be:

The main chain is CH2-CH2, but each of
