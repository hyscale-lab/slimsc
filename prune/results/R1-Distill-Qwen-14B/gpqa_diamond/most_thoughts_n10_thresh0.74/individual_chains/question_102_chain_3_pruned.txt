Okay, so I've got this question here about a genetic construct and some microscopy results. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let me try to think through it.

So the setup is that someone is working with a ligand-receptor pair expressed in neural crest cells. They want to study their developmental fate by looking at their interaction. The ligand is a coiled-coil with two alpha helices, and the receptor is a monomeric transmembrane protein with eight alpha helices, four extracellular, and three beta sheets forming a binding site. Interesting structural details, but maybe not directly relevant to the question.

They've created a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. So bicistronic means two coding regions in one vector, right? The ligand's ORF is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry. The receptor is at the 3', fused to eGFP at the C-terminus. So the vector has two proteins: ligand-mCherry and receptor-eGFP.

The ligand is under the CBA promoter. CBA is a strong promoter, I think, maybe constitutive. Then, upstream of the receptor is the IRES regulatory element. IRES allows for internal ribosome entry, so maybe the receptor is expressed as a separate transcript, or perhaps in a way that allows both ligand and receptor to be expressed from the same vector but at different levels? Or maybe the IRES is used for the receptor expression, allowing for separate translation without a second promoter?

Wait, the vector is bicistronic, so perhaps it uses an IRES to allow for the expression of the second gene. The first gene (ligand) is under the CBA promoter, which is strong, and then the second gene (receptor) is after an IRES. IRES elements can drive the expression of a second open reading frame in a bicistronic mRNA. So the structure is probably: CBA promoter -> ligand ORF -> IRES -> receptor ORF.

But wait, looking at the question again: the ligand is under the CBA promoter, and upstream of the receptor is the IRES. Hmm, wait, no, maybe the vector is ligand first, then IRES, then receptor. Oh, wait, no, the question says: the ligand is at the 5' position, fused to mCherry. So the ligand is expressed as a fusion protein (ligand-mCherry), and the receptor is at the 3' end, fused to eGFP.

Wait, but the way it's set up, each gene (ligand and receptor) are in the same vector, but each might have their own expression cassettes. Let me parse the question again.

The vector is a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. So it's a single vector with two cistrons. The ligand's ORF is at the 5' position, fused to mCherry. So the ligand is probably in a construct like CBA promoter driving a transcript that includes ligand followed by mCherry. Then, the receptor's ORF is at the 3' end, fused to eGFP at the C-terminus, meaning
