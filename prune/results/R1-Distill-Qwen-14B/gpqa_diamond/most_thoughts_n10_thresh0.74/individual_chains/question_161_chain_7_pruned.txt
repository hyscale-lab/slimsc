Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this electron microscope question. Let me read it again carefully.

So, Mike is working on a high-resolution transmission electron microscope. It's operating at 1000 kV accelerating voltage. He connected vacuum pumps to create an ultra-high vacuum in the sample compartment. The pressure is less than 10^-9 Torr, which is super low. The purpose is to minimize gas molecules because that helps with electron microscopy—like reducing scattering or something.

But despite the vacuum pumps, some gas particles are still there. They were detected by a mass spectrometer. Mike calculated the mean free path of these gas molecules as λ1. Mean free path depends on factors like pressure, temperature, and the volume of the compartment. So, when the vacuum is good, the mean free path is longer because pressure is lower. Oh right, the mean free path λ is inversely proportional to pressure, I think. Because lower pressure means fewer molecules, so less collisions, longer λ.

Then, when Mike starts the electron beam, he notices that the mean free path changes. It's now λ2, which is not equal to λ1. The question is, what can we conclude about λ2 compared to λ1?

Hmm. So why would the mean free path change when the electron beam is on? The temperature remained the same, so that factor isn't changing. Oh, wait, the electron beam is probably generating some sort of effect on the gas molecules.

I remember that in electron microscopy, when the beam is active, it can cause various effects. One thing that comes to mind is that the electrons can interact with the gas molecules. Like, maybe ionizing them or causing them to move. Or perhaps heating the gas.

Wait, but the temperature is the same, so thermal effects might not be the main issue. Unless the electron beam is causing localized heating, but the problem states that the temperature remained the same, so maybe that's not it.

Another thought: when the electron beam is on, it's a high-energy beam—1000 kV is pretty high. Those electrons have a lot of energy. They might be causing the gas molecules to scatter more often, or perhaps the electrons are actually bombarding the gas particles, which could change their distribution or the effective pressure.

Wait, but pressure is already very low. But wait, maybe the electron beam causes the gas molecules to become ionized. If that happens, the ions would interact differently with the electrons in the beam. Or maybe the gas becomes partially ionized, creating a plasma-like state. But in such a low-pressure environment, is that possible? I'm not sure.

Alternatively, think about the mean free path in the presence of an electron beam. The beam itself is a source of radiation that might cause the gas particles to move or change their velocity distribution. But how does that affect the mean free path?

Wait, the mean free path in a gas (without considering the beam) is given by the Knudsen equation: λ = (k*T)/(sqrt(2)*π*d^2*P), where d is the diameter of the gas molecules, P is pressure, and T is temperature. So if P is the same, and T is same, λ should be same. But in this case, when the beam is on, maybe the pressure isn't the same anymore.

Wait, maybe the electron beam is causing some of the gas molecules to be excited or ionized,
