Okay, so I need to figure out which symmetries must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but let's think this through.

First, what is SMEFT? Oh right, it's the Standard Model Effective Field Theory. It's a framework that incorporates all possible higher-dimensional operators that can be added to the Standard Model Lagrangian, respecting certain symmetries.

So the question is asking which symmetries all operators in SMEFT must respect. The options given are Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry. The choices are combinations of these.

Wait, I remember that in any relativistic theory, you have to respect certain symmetries. Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry and translations. So if an operator doesn't respect Poincare, it can't be part of a relativistic theory. But wait, SMEFT is an effective theory which is still Lorentz-invariant, right?

So the operators in SMEFT must respect Lorentz symmetry. Because if they didn't, the theory wouldn't be relativistic, which it is. So Lorentz symmetry (1) must be respected.

What about Poincare symmetry (2)? Poincare includes both Lorentz and translation symmetries. So if an operator respects Lorentz and is compatible with translation symmetry, then Poincare is respected. But in an effective theory, I think the operators are constructed to be Poincare-invariant. So Poincare symmetry must also be respected.

Wait, but do SMEFT operators automatically respect Poincare
