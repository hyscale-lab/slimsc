Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about stars and their temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms. Hmm, let me try to think this through.

The question says that in star_1, iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh, right, I remember that in stellar atmospheres, the excitation of atoms is related to the temperature. The assumption is that both photospheres are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), so the Boltzmann equation applies here.

Wait, the Boltzmann equation relates the population of different energy levels to temperature. The formula is something like n_i / n_j = (g_i / g_j) * exp( - (E_i - E_j)/(k*T) ), right? Where n_i and n_j are the number of atoms in energy levels i and j, g is the statistical weight, E is the energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is temperature.

In this problem, the energy difference is given as 1.38e-23 J. Let me denote ΔE as 1.38e-23 J. The problem says that in star_1, the excitation is twice that of star_2. So for star_1, n1_i / n1_j is twice the ratio for star_2: n2_i / n2_j.

Wait, no, the exact wording is that the atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. So perhaps the ratio of the excited state (n_i) to the ground state (n_j) is higher. So for star_1, the ratio is higher than in star_2.

Assuming that the statistical weights are the same for both stars (since it's the same element, same energy levels), g_i and g_j are same for both. So the equation simplifies.

So, for star_1: n1_i / n1_j = exp( -ΔE/(k*T1) )
Similarly, for star_2: n2_i / n2_j = exp( -ΔE/(k*T2) )

But wait, the problem says that in star_1, the excitation is twice that of star_2. So n1_i / n1_j = 2 * (n2_i / n2_j). Because star_1 has twice as many atoms in that excited state as star_2.

So putting it together:

n1_i/n1_j = 2 * (n2_i/n2_j )

But from Boltzmann:

n1_i/n1_j = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

n2_i/n2_j = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

So substituting, we have exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )
