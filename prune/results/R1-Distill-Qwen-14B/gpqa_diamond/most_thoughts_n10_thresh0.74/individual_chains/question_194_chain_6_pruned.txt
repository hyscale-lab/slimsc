Okay, so I've got this problem here about spins and the partition function. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on my statistical mechanics, but I'll give it a shot.

The problem says we have three spins, S1, S2, S3. Each can be +1 or -1. The energy of the system is given by E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. We're supposed to find the partition function Z, and the options are given.

Hmm, the partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of exp(-βE), where β is 1/(kT). So first, I need to figure out all the possible states of the system and calculate E for each state.

Each spin can be +1 or -1, so there are 2^3 = 8 possible states. Let's list them all. Maybe I can assign each spin to a binary state where +1 is 0 and -1 is 1 or something, but perhaps it's easier to just list all possible combinations.

The combinations are:
1. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=+1
2. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1
3. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1
4. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1
5. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=+1
6. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=-1
7. S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=+1
8. S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=-1

Now, for each state, I need to compute E. Let's compute each term.

The energy is E = -J (S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). So each term S_i S_j is either +1 or -1, because each S is ±1. So S_i S_j = +1 if they're the same, -1 if different.

Let me compute each state:

1. All spins +1.
Each product S1S2, S1S3, S2S3 are all +1.
Sum is 3. So E = -J * 3 = -3J.

2. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1.
S1S2 = 1, S1S3 = -1, S2S3 = -1.
Sum is 1 -1 -1 = -1.
E = -J*(-1) = J.

3. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1.
S1S2 = -1, S1S3=1, S2S3=-1.
Sum: -1 +1 -1 = -1.
E = J.

4. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1.
S1S2=-1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=1.
Sum: -1 -1 +1 = -1.
E = J.

5. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=+1.
S1S2=-1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=1.
Sum: -1-1+1= -1.
E = J.

6. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=-1.
S1S2=-1, S1S3=1, S2S3=-1.
Sum: -1 +1 -1 = -1.
E = J.

7. S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=+1.
S1S2=1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1.
Sum:1 -1 -1 = -1.
E = J.

8. All spins -1.
Each product is 1. Sum=3.
E = -J *3 = -3J.

So now, let's tabulate the energies:

States 1 and 8: E = -3J
States 2-7: E = J each.

Wait, no. Wait, in the states 2-7, each has E= J? Let me check:

Wait no, State 2: sum is 1-1-1 = -1 → E= J*(1) because E= -J*(-1) → E= J.

Similarly, State3: sum is (-1) +1 + (-1) = -1 → E = J.

Same for all 2-7. So each of these 6 states has E= J.

Wait, no. State 4: sum is -1-1+1= -1 → E= J.

Yes, so states 2-7 (6 states) each have energy E= J, and states 1 and 8 have E= -3J.

Therefore, to compute the partition function Z, we'll have terms for each state. Z is the sum of exp(-β E) for each state.

Wait, but wait: each state's energy contributes exp(-β E).

So for each state in 2-7, E= J. So each contributes exp(-β * J).

There are 6 such states.

For state 1 and 8: E= -3J, so each contributes exp(-β*(-3J)) = exp(3β J).

So Z is:

Z = 2 * exp(3β J) + 6 * exp(-β J).

Wait, looking at the options, let's see.

Option A: 2 e^(-3Jβ) +6 e^(Jβ)

Wait no, in our case, for E=-3J, exp(-β E) is exp(3β J). So the term is 2 exp(3β J).

For the other states, E= J, so exp(-β*J) = exp(-J beta). So 6 exp(-J beta).

So Z= 2 e^{3Jβ} +6 e^{-Jβ}.

Wait, looking at the options:

Option B: 2 e^{3Jβ} +6 e^{-Jβ} → Yes, that's what we have.

Wait, let me double-check the options.

Option A: 2 e^{-3Jβ}+6e^{Jβ} → No, because our high energy state is E=J, which would be multiplied by e^{-β J} when β is positive.

Wait, wait. Wait, no. Wait, E is negative in some cases. So the partition function is sum exp(-β E). So when E is negative, exp(-β E) becomes exp(positive).

So for E=-3J, exp(-β*(-3J))= exp(3β J). So that's the first term.

For the other states, E=J, so exp(-β*J) = e^{-β J}.

So Z= 2 e^{3 β J} +6 e^{- β J}.

Looking at the options, option B is:

Z= 2 e^{3Jβ} +6e^{-Jβ}

Yes, that's what we have. So option B is correct.

Wait, but wait another thing. Did I make a mistake in
