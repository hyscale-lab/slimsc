Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again and try to break it down.

The problem says: Let |alpha> be the state describing an electron. It's proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. So, I think that means |alpha> = c*(1+i)|up> + c*(2-i)|down>, where c is some normalization constant. Oh wait, no, the question says it's proportional, so the actual state is (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>, but I need to normalize it. Right, because any quantum state must have a norm (inner product with itself) equal to 1.

Next, I need to calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of a certain operator. The operator has a matrix representation A where A_ij is hbar/2 if i≠j and 0 otherwise. Hmm, wait, that's a 2x2 matrix because the state is in two dimensions (up and down). So for a 2x2 matrix:

A = [ [0, hbar/2],
      [hbar/2, 0] ]

Wait, no, because when i≠j, A_ij is hbar/2, and when i=j, it's zero. So for a two-level system, it's a matrix with 0 on the diagonal and hbar/2 elsewhere. That's interesting. So A looks like:

[ 0, (ħ/2) ]
[ (ħ/2), 0 ]

Wait, but then what are the eigenvalues of this matrix? Because the eigenstates of A would correspond to the possible measurement outcomes, and the probabilities would be the squared magnitudes of the components in those eigenstates.

So first, let's find the eigenvalues of matrix A. For a 2x2 matrix, the eigenvalues can be found by solving the characteristic equation det(A - λI) = 0.

The matrix A - λI is:
[ -λ, ħ/2 ]
[ ħ/2, -λ ]

The determinant is (λ^2) - (ħ/2)^2 = 0. So λ² = (ħ²/4), which gives λ = ± ħ/2. Oh, wait, so the eigenvalues are ħ/2 and -ħ/2. So the operator A has eigenvalues ± ħ/2.

Wait, but wait a minute. Let me think again. The operator A is given as having A_ij = ħ/2 when i≠j, and 0 otherwise. So for a 2x2 system, the matrix is indeed [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]]. So the trace is zero, and determinant is -(ħ/2)^2. So the eigenvalues are ± (ħ/2) because the trace is zero, so the sum of eigenvalues is zero, meaning they are equal in magnitude and opposite in sign.

Now, the eigenstates corresponding to these eigenvalues. Let's find them. For λ = ħ/2, the equation (A - λ I)|v> = 0.

A - λ I is:
[-
