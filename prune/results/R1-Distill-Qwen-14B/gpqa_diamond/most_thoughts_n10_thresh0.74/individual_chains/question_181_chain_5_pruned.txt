Okay, so I've got this physics problem about neutrinos from the Sun. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my solar neutrino production, but let's try to think it through.

The question says that the pp-III branch suddenly stopped in the Sun's core about 8.5 minutes ago. Wait, what's the pp-III branch? I remember that the proton-proton chain is the main source of energy in the Sun. The pp-I, II, III are different stages of that chain. Oh right! The pp-I branch produces helium-4 by two protons fusing, then another two protons add on, but wait, maybe I'm mixing that up. Alternatively, the pp-III branch might be a specific part of the proton-proton cycle where three protons fuse, possibly leading to a boron-8 isotope or something.

Wait, I think the pp-III branch is the part where two protons and a helium-4 nucleus (alpha particle) combine to form boron-8. Because the pp-I is the initial stage, pp-II is the next step, and pp-III is the part where they combine with helium. Oh wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, the pp-III branch might be the part of the chain where four protons combine via a different pathway, but I'm not entirely sure. But regardless, the pp-III branch is a significant source of high-energy neutrinos, especially the ones in the 700-800 keV and 800-900 keV bands.

So
