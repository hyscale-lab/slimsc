Okay, so I'm trying to solve this nuclear decay question. Let me read it again carefully.

The problem is about a nuclear decay where two heavy nucleons of flavor A decay into two B's along with two lighter particles E and V. The reaction is 2A → 2B + 2E + 2V. It's noted that the total energy spectrum of E is continuous with an endpoint Q.

Then there's a variant where instead of two V particles, it emits one exotic, massless particle M. So the reaction becomes 2A → 2B + 2E + M. The question is about how the E particles' energy spectrum changes compared to the original decay.

Hmm, I remember that in particle decays, the energy spectrum of emitted particles depends on whether the decay products are massive or not, and whether they are charged or not. Oh wait, in beta decay, the emitted electrons have a continuous spectrum because the neutrino carries away some energy. So in that case, the maximum energy (endpoint) of the electrons depends on the available energy and the masses involved.

In the original decay, E and V are emitted. Since both are lighter, maybe they have some mass. The fact that E's energy is continuous suggests that there are other particles (like V) that share the energy, similar to how in beta decay the electron and antineutrino take energy, making the electron's spectrum continuous.

In the original scenario, each E and V would share energy. So the energy of E can vary up to a maximum determined by the total Q value and the masses of the products. But when the decay changes to emit M, which is massless, that might change things.

Wait, M is massless, so perhaps it's like a photon or a neutrino. In the new decay, 2A → 2B + 2E + M. Since M is massless, it's like adding another particle that carries away energy and momentum.

In the original case, both E and V are emitted. Since V has mass, each V would contribute to the energy. Now, with M, which is massless, maybe the energy distribution changes.

I remember that in cases where a particle decays into two particles (like a pion into a mu and a neutrino), the emitted muon's energy is continuous, but the maximum depends on the mass. But when the decay product includes a massless particle, the endpoint of the emitted particles can be higher because the massless particle doesn't contribute to the rest mass as much.

Wait, in the original decay, the two E and two V are emitted. Let's think about energy conservation. Each E and V would carry some energy. Suppose each E has energy E_e and each V has energy E_v. The sum of their energies plus the kinetic energy of the B's would equal the Q value.

But since E's are lighter, their energy spectrum is continuous because they can share energy with V. But in the new case, instead of two V's, there's one M. Since M is massless, maybe it's like adding another particle that doesn't contribute to the rest mass, so the energy division could be different.

Wait, perhaps I should model this with conservation of energy and momentum. Let me think about a similar process, like beta decay. In beta decay, a nucleus emits an electron and an antineutrino. The electron's energy depends on the neutrino's energy because they are emitted in opposite directions—so their energies add up to a maximum based on the decay's Q value.

In the original scenario, 2A → 2B + 2E + 2V. All these particles must be emitted. If E and V have mass, then each pair of E and V would carry away some energy. The total energy available is fixed, so each E's maximum possible energy would depend on the masses of E and V.

In the variant decay, 2A → 2B + 2E + M. Now, M is massless, so it behaves like a photon or a
