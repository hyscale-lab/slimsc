Okay, so I need to figure out which starting material is used to synthesize 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohex-1-ene via ring-closing metathesis. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my metathesis reactions, but I'll try to think this through.

Ring-closing metathesis typically involves a transition metal catalyst, like Grubbs catalyst, which facilitates the redistribution of alkene fragments. The process forms a ring by connecting two ends of a diene. So, the starting material should be a diene that, when the metathesis occurs, forms the cyclohexene ring.

The target molecule is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohex-1-ene. Let me try to visualize its structure. The cyclohexene ring has double bond between carbons 1 and 2. Then, at carbon 3 and 4, there are methyl groups. Carbon 5 has an isopropyl group.

So the structure is a six-membered ring, with substituents at 3,4, and 5 positions. The substituents are methyl, methyl, and isopropyl respectively.

In ring-closing metathesis, the catalyst would break and reform the double bonds. So, the starting material should be an octadiene, because when it undergoes metathesis, it would form a six-membered ring. So the diene will form the ring, and the substituents should be positioned such that after metathesis, the substituents end up in the correct positions.

Let me think about the structure. The target has substituents at 3,4, and 5. The starting material must have these substituents on the diene in such a way that when the ring closes, they end up in the correct positions.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the positions of the substituents in the starting diene. For ring-closing metathesis, the diene would have two double bonds, but I don't think so. Wait, no, metathesis typically uses a diene as the starting material, but perhaps as a diene with two double bonds or a diene with substituents that can form the ring.

Wait, no, ring-closing metathesis usually involves a single diene, right? Because the catalyst breaks the diene into two parts and reforms a ring with a double bond. So the starting material is an alkyldiene, like an octadiene, which upon metathesis forms a cyclohexene.

So the starting material should have the substituents in such a way that when the ring forms, the substituents are at the correct positions.

Let me think of the starting material as a diene with substituents. The target molecule is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohexene. So, the substituents are at positions 3,4,5.

In the starting material, which is an octadiene, the substituents would be in positions that, when the ring closes, those substituents end up at 3,4,5.

Wait, maybe if I number the octadiene as positions 1 to 8. If the double bonds are at positions 1-2 and 6-7
