Okay, let's try to tackle this chemistry problem. Hmm, it's a bit tricky, but I'll take it step by step. So, the question involves heating a mixture of salts and then observing the changes through various chemical reactions. The goal is to find the total number of all atoms in the original salts.

First, let me parse the problem. We have salts A and B in equimolar amounts, totaling 7.20 grams. When heated at 200°C without air, a mixture of gases is formed. These gases are passed through three tubes: Mg(ClO4)2, Ca(OH)2 solution, and red-hot copper.

The results are:
- Tube 1 (Mg(ClO4)2) gains 3.60g.
- Tube 3 (copper) gains 0.80g, forming CuO.
- Tube 2 (Ca(OH)2) shows no change.
- Finally, 2.24 liters of gas C remain at STP.

I need to figure out what these observations mean. Let's think about each step.

Tube 1 has Mg(ClO4)2, which is a drying agent. It reacts with water vapor, I think. So, if the weight increased by 3.60g, that probably means water was absorbed. The reaction would be Mg(ClO4)2 + H2O → Mg(ClO4)2·nH2O. So, the mass gain here is due to water. So, the 3.60g is the mass of water vapor.

Wait, but wait. The formula for Mg(ClO4)2 is Mg(ClO4)₂. When it absorbs water, it becomes Mg(ClO4)₂·nH₂O. The gain in mass is the mass of the water absorbed. So, 3.60g is the mass of H2O. Let me calculate the moles of H2O. Molar mass of H2O is 18 g/mol. So, 3.60 / 18 = 0.2 mol of H2O.

Then, tube 3 is red-hot copper. The gas that comes in reacts with it. The gain is 0.80g, which is CuO formed. So, we can find the moles of CuO. Molar mass of CuO is 80 g/mol (63.55 for Cu, 16 for O). 0.80 / 80 = 0.01 mol of CuO.

What reaction would produce CuO? Typically, CO would react with Cu to form CuO and CO2. Alternatively, maybe H2 is burning, but it's more likely CO reacting. Wait, but in tube 3, the copper is red-hot. So, if the incoming gas is CO, it would react:

CO + Cu → CuO + C (carbon).

Wait, no, the products would be CO2 and Cu, if it's combustion. Alternatively, maybe the gas is H2. H2 could react with CuO at high temperatures, but I'm not sure. Wait, perhaps the gas is a mixture, and only CO reacts with Cu. Let me think.

Another possibility is that the gas is a mixture of H2 and CO. Because when you heat certain metal carbonates or hydroxides, you can get a mix of gases. But let's think about the reactions.

Alternatively, perhaps the gas passing through tube 3 is CO, which is oxidized. Let me consider the possible gases.

The initial heating of salts A and B produces a mixture of gases. These could be CO, CO2, H2, O2, maybe NH3, but that's less likely. But considering the next steps, let's think about what each tube does.

Tube 1 is for absorbing water, so the gas leaving tube 1 is dry. Tube 2 is Ca(OH)2 solution, which would react with CO2. If tube 2's weight didn't change, that suggests that no CO2 was present in the gas. Because if there were CO2, it would react with Ca(OH)2 to form CaCO3 and water, causing the tube's mass to increase. Since it didn't change, CO2 isn't present or in negligible amounts.

Wait, but what if other gases react? No, Ca(OH)2 solution mainly reacts with CO2. So, the absence of reaction suggests no CO2 after tube 1. So, the gas after tube 1 (which is dry) doesn't have CO2. So, any CO2 must have been removed by tube 2, but since tube 2 didn't change, maybe the initial gases have no CO2.

Wait, but wait. The gases passed through tube 1 (water absorbed) then tube 2 (CO2 would be absorbed). But since tube 2 didn't gain mass, maybe the gases after tube 1 have no CO2, meaning any CO2 in the initial gas was removed by tube 2. But if tube 2 didn't gain mass, then CO2 was not present in the gas after tube 1. So, the initial gas must have had CO2, which was absorbed by tube 2, and the remaining gas after tube 2 has no CO2.

But this is getting a bit confusing. Let me outline the steps:

1. The initial gas mixture is passed through tube 1: Mg(ClO4)2, which absorbs H2O. So, the gas leaving tube 1 is dry. The mass gain here is 3.60g, which is 0.2 mol of H2O.

2. Then, the gas goes through tube 2: Ca(OH)2 solution. If any CO2 was present, it would react, and the tube would gain mass. But the problem says the weight of tube 2 hasn't changed. So, no CO2 was present after tube 1, meaning all CO2 must have been absorbed in tube 2. Therefore, the gas after tube 1 (which is dry) had no CO2, so any CO2 in the original gas must have been removed by tube 2. But wait, the initial gas includes CO2. Then, CO2 would be absorbed in tube 2, but since tube 2 didn't gain mass, that implies that the CO2 wasn't there. Hmm, perhaps the initial gas had no CO2, or maybe there's another possibility.

Alternatively, perhaps the gas did have CO2, but it's possible that in the presence of other gases, the CO2 didn't react. No, that's not likely because Ca(OH)2 solution definitely reacts with CO2.

Wait, maybe the gas after tube 1 had no CO2, so all CO2 must have been removed by tube 2, but the tube's mass didn't change. That would mean that the amount of CO2 was zero. So, the initial gas didn't have any CO2. So, the gases formed upon heating A and B don't include CO2.

Wait, but that's conflicting with some possibilities. Let me think again.

Suppose the initial gas is a mixture of H2 and CO. Then, when passed through tube 1, which absorbs water, but in this case, the initial gas after heating doesn't have H2O, so tube 1's gain is 3.60g, which is H2O. So, the original gas must have contained H2O vapor. Absorbing it in tube 1, so the gas after tube 1 has H2O removed.

Then, the gas goes to tube 2, which is Ca(OH)2 solution. If there's CO2, it would react. But since tube 2's mass didn't change, there's no CO2 in the gas after tube 1. So, the initial gas after tube 1 has no CO2. So, any CO2 must have been removed by tube 2. But in this scenario, the initial gas must have CO2, which is captured by tube 2, leading to a gain in mass. But the problem says that tube 2's weight didn't change. Hmm, this is confusing.

Wait, perhaps the initial gas doesn't include CO2, so tube 2 doesn't gain any mass. Then, the initial gas after tube 1 is H2 and CO (and maybe others). Let's proceed.

After tube 2, the gas then goes to tube 3, which is red-hot copper. The gas here reacts, and the tube gains 0.80g, which is CuO. So, what reaction would produce CuO from the incoming gas?

Possibly, CO reacts with Cu. Let me write the reaction:

CO + Cu → CuO + C.

But wait, that's an oxidation reaction. Alternatively, when CO reacts with Cu at high temperatures, it can form CuO and CO2, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is:

2CO + 2Cu → 2CuO + CO2.

Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the gas is H2. H2 can react with CuO, but that's usually under different conditions.

Wait, another approach: the gas that reacts in tube 3 is CO. Because when CO passes through hot copper, it can be oxidized. Let's think—CO is oxidized to CO2, and Cu is oxidized to CuO. So, the reaction is:

2 CO + 2 Cu → 2 CuO + CO2.

But wait, if the amount of CO is limited, perhaps it doesn't go to completion. Let me calculate the moles involved.

We have 0.80g of CuO formed. The molar mass is 80 g/mol. So, 0.80 / 80 = 0.01 mol CuO. So, from the reaction above, 2 moles of CO would produce 2 moles of CuO. So, 0.01 mol CuO implies 0.01 mol CO consumed. Wait, but the reaction equation would be:

CO + Cu → CuO + C (solid). Maybe that's the reaction. So, for each mole of CO, one mole of CuO is formed. So, 0.01 mol CuO implies 0.01 mol CO reacted.

But wait, the problem states that after passing through all tubes, 2.24 L of gas remains. Since 2.24 L is at STP, which is 0.1 mol. So, the gas after tube 3 is 0.1 mol.

Let me recap:

- The initial gas has H2O (3.6g, 0.2mol) and some other gases.

- Tube 1: H2O is absorbed (3.6g), so gas after is dry.

- Tube 2: No CO2, so gas after tube 2 is same as after tube 1, except H2O removed.

- Tube 3: CO reacts with Cu to form CuO. So, the gas after tube 3 is the remaining gas plus any products.

Wait, but the gases after tube 3 are 2.24 L at STP, which is 0.1 mol. So, what's that gas?

If CO was the gas reacting in tube 3, then the remaining gas could be H2, maybe.

Alternatively, let's model this.

Let me outline the steps:

1. The initial gas after heating the salts (A and B) is a mixture containing H2O, CO, and H2. Let's say.

2. Tube 1 absorbs H2O: so gas after is CO and H2.

3. Tube 2: no CO2, so it's inert to Ca(OH)2. So, gas remains CO and H2.

4. Tube 3: CO reacts with Cu. Let's think about the reaction.

So, in tube 3, CO reacts with Cu to form CuO and CO2. Because when CO passes through hot Cu, it can be oxidized to CO2.

The reaction is:

2 CO + Cu → CuO + CO2.

Wait, but let's balance this properly.

The balanced equation is:

2 CO + Cu → CuO + CO2.

Wait, let's check:

Cu is +2 on the right (CuO), so oxidation state goes from 0 to +2 (oxidized).

CO is acting as a reducing agent, being oxidized to CO2 (oxidation state from +2 to +4 in C).

So, for each mole of Cu, 2 moles of CO are consumed.

So, the moles of CuO formed is 0.01 mol, meaning 0.01 mol of Cu → 0.01 mol CuO.

From the reaction, 2 mol CO → 1 mol CuO. So, 0.01 mol CuO implies 0.02 mol CO reacted.

Wait, but earlier I thought 0.01 mol CuO would imply 0.01 mol CO, but maybe I made a mistake in the stoichiometry.

Wait, the balanced equation is:

2 CO + Cu → CuO + CO2.

So, 2 moles of CO react with 1 mole of Cu to produce 1 mole of CuO and 1 mole of CO2.

So, for 0.01 mole of CuO, 0.02 mole of CO would have reacted.

So, the amount of CO that reacted is 0.02 mole.

But the mass gained in tube 3 is 0.80g of CuO, which is 0.01 mole. So, from the stoichiometry, 2 CO → 1 CuO. So, 0.02 mole CO consumed.

So, the remaining gas after tube 3 is H2 and CO2.

Wait, because the reaction produces CO2. So, the remaining gas is H2 and CO2. But according to the problem, after all the tubes, 2.24 L (0.1 mol) of gas C remains.

Hmm, but according to the problem statement, the gas after all the tubes is 2.24 liters, which is 0.1 mol.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let's try to outline all the steps.

Initial gas mixture:

Assume it's a mixture of H2O, CO, and H2.

After tube 1: H2O is removed, so gas is CO and H2.

Tube 2: No CO2, so gas remains CO and H2.

Tube 3: CO reacts with Cu to form CuO and CO2. So, the reaction consumes some CO and produces CO2.

But the gas that leaves tube 3 is H2 and CO2.

Then, since the problem says that after all the tubes, 2.24 L (0.1 mol) of gas C remains. So, gas C is the remaining gas after all reactions.

Wait, but what is gas C? The problem says only 2.24 L of gas C remained. So, perhaps gas C is H2, because CO2 would have been produced in tube 3, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the gas C is CO, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps the initial gases are H2O, CO, and H2. After tube 1, H2O is removed, leaving CO and H2. Then, in tube 3, CO reacts to form CO2 and CuO. So, the gas leaving tube 3 would be H2 and CO2.

But the problem states that after all the tubes, 2.24 L of gas C remains. So, perhaps gas C is H2.

Wait, but what about the CO2? It's possible that CO2 is a gas leaving, but maybe it's not counted as gas C because the problem says only gas C remained.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial gas is CO and H2. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the initial gas after heating is CO and H2. Then, tube 1's Mg(ClO4)2 doesn't absorb any H2O, but wait, the problem says that the weight of tube 1 increased by 3.60g, which suggests water was present. So, initial gas has H2O.

So, initial gas mixture: H2O, CO, H2.

After tube 1: H2O is removed; gas is CO and H2.

Tube 2: no reaction (no CO2), so gas remains CO and H2.

Tube 3: CO reacts with Cu to form CuO and CO2. So, CO is consumed, and CO2 is produced. So, after tube 3, the gas is H2 and CO2.

But the problem says that the only gas remaining is gas C, 2.24 L. So, perhaps CO2 is the gas C, but then, why isn't tube 2 reacting? Because tube 2 is a solution of Ca(OH)2, which would react with CO2. So, if CO2 is present after tube 3, it should have been absorbed in tube 2. But earlier, the problem says that tube 2's weight didn't change. So, that can't be.

Hmm, there's a contradiction here. Let me think again.

Maybe the initial gas doesn't contain CO2. So, maybe the initial gas is H2O, CO, and H2.

After tube 1: gas is CO and H2.

Tube 2: no CO2, so no reaction. So, gas remains CO and H2.

Tube 3: CO reacts with Cu to form CuO and CO2. So, the gas leaving tube 3 is H2 and CO2.

But wait, tube 2 was Ca(OH)2 solution. So, any CO2 produced in tube 3 would have passed through tube 2 after being produced. Wait, no: the order is tube 1 → 2 → 3. So, the gas goes through tube 1, then tube 2, then tube 3. So, the reaction in tube 3 would produce CO2, but that CO2 would have come after tube 2. So, the CO2 would not have been absorbed in tube 2 because it's after tube 3.

Wait, but that can't be, because the order is 1 → 2 → 3. So, the gas from the initial source goes through 1, then 2, then 3. So, if in tube 3, CO is converted to CO2, that CO2 would leave tube 3 and go into the collection, but tube 2 was before that. So, the CO2 would be after tube 2.

But tube 2 is Ca(OH)2 solution, which would absorb CO2. So, if in tube 3, CO2 is formed, it would have been absorbed in tube 2. But the problem says that the weight of tube 2 didn't change, which implies no CO2 passed through it.

So, this suggests that CO2 wasn't formed before tube 2, meaning that in tube 3, the reaction didn't produce CO2. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction in tube 3 doesn't produce CO2, but something else.

Wait, another possibility: the initial gas has H2O, CO, and H2. Tube 1 removes H2O. So, gas is CO and H2. Then, in tube 3, CO reacts with Cu to form CO2 and CuO. But the CO2 produced would then pass through tube 2, which would absorb it, leading to a gain in mass in tube 2. However, the problem states that tube 2's mass didn't change, so that can't be the case. So, this suggests that no CO2 was formed, which would mean the reaction in tube 3 didn't produce CO2. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction in tube 3 produces H2O again. Wait, no, because tube 1 already removed H2O. Or perhaps the reaction in tube 3 is different.

Wait, perhaps the reaction in tube 3 is the oxidation of H2. H2 can react with CuO to form H2O and Cu. But that reaction would require the presence of CuO, which tube 3 provides as a solid. Let me think about the reaction:

H2 + CuO → H2O + Cu.

But in this case, the H2 would be consumed, and CuO would be reduced to Cu. The mass gain in tube 3 would then be due to the amount of Cu produced. Wait, but in the problem, the gain is 0.80g of CuO. So, that doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is different.

Alternatively, maybe the gas is H2 and CO, and a shift reaction occurs in the presence of Cu.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the oxidation of H2 and CO, producing H2O and CO2. But then, tube 1 would have absorbed H2O, but that's already been removed. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is better approached by considering the gases that passed through each tube.

Let me make a list of the possible gases and where they are absorbed:

- H2O: absorbed in tube 1 (3.6g, 0.2mol).
- CO2: would be absorbed in tube 2. But since tube 2 didn't gain mass, no CO2 in the gas after tube 1.
- CO: reacts in tube 3 to form CuO and CO2. But then, the CO2 would be after tube 2, which would cause tube 2 to gain mass. But since it didn't, this suggests that no CO2 was produced in tube 3. So, perhaps the reaction in tube 3 doesn't produce CO2.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction in tube 3 doesn't produce CO2, but something else. For example, maybe the gas is H2, which reacts with CuO to form Cu and water. But that would require CuO to be present, which it is. Let's think:

H2 + CuO → H2O + Cu.

But in this reaction, the H2 would be consumed, and CuO would be reduced to Cu. The mass change would be the mass of the product, which is Cu. If 0.80g of Cu were formed, the molar mass is 64g/mol. 0.80/64 = 0.0125 mol. But the reaction is 1:1, so 0.0125 mol H2 consumed, but that's not matching the given data.

Wait, in the problem, the mass gained in tube 3 is 0.80g, which is CuO. So, perhaps the reaction doesn't produce CuO but instead forms something else. Hmm, this is getting complicated.

Alternative approach: Let's consider all the data and model the possible reactions.

Total mass of salts A and B is 7.20g.

Upon heating, they release H2O, CO, and H2. Let's model the gases as H2O, CO, H2.

Then, after tube 1: H2O is removed. So, CO and H2 remain.

Tube 2: No CO2, so these gases pass through.

Tube 3: CO reacts with Cu to form CuO and CO2.

So, the reaction is: 2 CO + Cu → CuO + CO2.

Molar amounts:

CuO formed: 0.01 mol.

From the reaction, 2 mol CO → 1 mol CuO.

So, 0.02 mol CO consumed. So, initial amount of CO after tube 1 is 0.02 + x, where x is the remaining CO.

But the problem states that after all the tubes, 2.24 L (0.1 mol) of gas remains. Let's figure out what that gas is.

After tube 3, the gas is H2 and CO2. But as tube 2 didn't gain mass, the CO2 must not have passed through tube 2. Wait, that's impossible because tube 2 is before tube 3.

Wait, no. The flow is: initial gas → tube 1 → tube 2 → tube 3 → gas collected.

So, the reaction in tube 3 produces CO2, which then goes into the gas collection. But tube 2 is before tube 3. So, any CO2 produced in tube 3 would leave tube 3 only after tube 2. But since tube 2 is a solution of Ca(OH)2, any CO2 would be absorbed there, leading to a gain in mass. But the problem says tube 2's mass didn't change. So, that would imply that no CO2 was present in the gas before tube 2. Therefore, the reaction in tube 3 must not produce CO2, which is confusing.

Hmm, perhaps the reaction in tube 3 is different. Let me think again. Maybe the gas is H2, which reacts with CuO in tube 3.

H2 + CuO → H2O + Cu.

In this case, H2 is consumed, and Cu is produced. The mass gain in tube 3 would be due to the Cu produced. But the problem states that the mass gain is 0.80g of CuO. That doesn't fit because Cu has a molar mass of ~64g/mol, while CuO is 80g/mol.

Wait, but the problem says the weight of tube 3 increased by 0.80g, and CuO was formed. So, the reaction must produce CuO. That suggests that O is being added. So, perhaps the reaction is the oxidation of CO.

Back to the earlier idea: CO + Cu → CuO + C.

But for each mole of CO, one mole of CuO is formed, and one mole of C (solid) is produced.

So, if 0.01 mol CuO is formed, then 0.01 mol CO was consumed. So, the CO after tube 1 was 0.01 mol. Then, after tube 3, that's all the CO consumed.

So, the remaining gas after tube 3 would be H2. The amount of H2 would be the initial amount minus any that might have reacted in tube 3.

But according to the problem, after all the reactions, 0.1 mol of gas C remains. If gas C is H2, then the moles of H2 after all reactions is 0.1 mol.

So, let's model the moles:

Initial moles:

H2O: 3.6g / 18g/mol = 0.2 mol.

CO: let's denote as x mol.

H2: let's denote as y mol.

After tube 1:

CO: x mol.

H2: y mol.

After tube 3:

CO: x - 0.01 mol (since 0.01 mol reacted to form CuO).

H2: y mol (assuming it didn't react).

But also, after tube 3, the gas is H2 and any CO that didn't react.

Wait, but the problem says that after all tubes, only gas C remains, which is 0.1 mol. So, perhaps all the CO was consumed in tube 3, leaving only H2.

So, if all CO was consumed, then x = 0.01 mol. Because 0.01 mol reacted to form CuO.

So, initial moles of CO is 0.01 mol.

Then, after tube 3, all CO is consumed, and the remaining gas is H2.

So, the moles of H2 after all tubes is 0.1 mol. Since it's after tube 3, which I think doesn't affect H2.

But wait, tube 3 is red-hot copper. Can H2 react with Cu? Well, H2 can react with CuO, but not with elemental Cu. So, if H2 passes through Cu, but Cu is in elemental form, perhaps no reaction occurs. So, H2 remains as is.

So, in this scenario, the moles of H2 after all tubes is y = 0.1 mol.

So, initial moles of H2 is y = 0.1 mol.

So, initial moles:

H2O: 0.2 mol,

CO: 0.01 mol,

H2: 0.1 mol.

Now, the total moles of gas before any tubes are 0.2 + 0.01 + 0.1 = 0.31 mol.

But wait, the problem states that after all reactions, 0.1 mol of gas C remains. So, that's just H2, 0.1 mol.

So, the initial moles:

H2O: 0.2 mol,

CO: 0.01 mol,

H2: 0.1 mol.

Now, the initial gas comes from heating salts A and B. So, the total moles of gas is 0.31 mol, but that doesn't directly relate to the masses of A and B.

But perhaps the salts A and B are such that when heated, they release these gases.

Assuming that the salts are metal carbonates or hydroxides, perhaps. For example, CaCO3 upon heating would release CO2 and H2O, but we don't have CO2 in our initial gas.

Alternatively, perhaps the salts are metal bicarbonates, which upon heating release CO2 and H2O. But again, we don't have CO2 in the initial gas.

Wait, but in our initial gas, we have H2O, CO, H2. So, perhaps the salts are not simple carbonates but more complex.

Alternatively, perhaps the salts are of metals that, when heated, release H2O and CO.

Wait, another possibility is that the salts are copper hydroxides. For example, Cu(OH)2 upon heating can decompose into CuO and H2O. But in that case, the gas would be H2O, but no CO or H2.

Alternatively, maybe the salts are of a metal that, upon heating, releases H2O and a carbonyl gas like CO.

Alternatively, perhaps the salts are such that they decompose into a metal and CO and H2O.

Wait, perhaps the salts are copper formate or acetate. For example, copper formate (Cu(HCOO)2) upon heating can decompose into CuO, CO, and H2O.

The decomposition reaction could be:

Cu(HCOO)2 → CuO + H2O + CO↑.

Let me check the stoichiometry. The formate ion is HCOO^-, which upon heating can release H2O and CO.

So, for each mole of Cu(HCOO)2, perhaps 1 mole of CO is released, along with H2O.

Similarly, perhaps each mole of the salt produces 1 mole of CO and 1 mole of H2O.

But in our case, we have CO and H2O in the gas. So, if the salts are Cu(HCOO)2 and perhaps another salt that releases H2.

Wait, but where would the H2 come from? Maybe another salt that releases H2 upon heating. For example, sodium hydride (NaH) decomposes upon heating to produce Na and H2 gas. But that's a possibility.

Alternatively, perhaps the salts are a mix of a carbonate and a metal hydride.

Wait, but the problem states that the initial gas is a mixture of gases, but no CO2. So, perhaps the salts don't produce CO2 upon heating.

Wait, perhaps the salts are NaH and CuCO3. Wait, but CuCO3 upon heating would decompose into CuO and CO2. But we don't have CO2 in our initial gas, so that can't be.

Hmm, perhaps the salts are NaH and Cu2O. Wait, Cu2O upon heating would decompose into Cu and H2O.

Cu2O → 2 Cu + H2O.

In that case, heating Cu2O would release H2O and Cu (solid). But that's only H2O as gas. So, perhaps the H2 in the initial gas comes from another salt.

Alternatively, perhaps the salts are NaH and CuO. No, CuO wouldn't release H2 upon heating.

Alternatively, perhaps the salts are a mixture of NaH and another carbonate that doesn't release CO2, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the salts are metal oxides that upon heating release H2O and other gases, but I'm not quite getting it.

Alternatively, perhaps the salts are not simple, and their decomposition produces H2O, CO, and H2.

Let me think of the initial moles:

H2O: 0.2 mol,

CO: 0.01 mol,

H2: 0.1 mol.

So, the total moles of gas is 0.31 mol.

But the initial mass of the salts is 7.20g. So, the salts upon heating release 0.31 mol of gas.

But perhaps each mole of salt releases a certain number of moles of gas. Let's model this.

Assume that salts A and B each produce a certain amount of gas upon heating.

Let me consider that both salts are the same, but maybe not. Since the mixture is equimolar, let's say n moles in total, with n = n_A + n_B, but perhaps not. Alternatively, perhaps each salt produces a certain amount of gas.

Alternatively, perhaps each salt produces a certain combination of gases.

But perhaps a better approach is to think about the salts as releasing H2O, CO, and H2 in the ratios we've determined.

So, the initial moles are H2O:0.2, CO:0.01, H2:0.1.

So, total moles of gas: 0.31.

Now, perhaps each mole of a certain salt produces a certain number of moles of these gases.

Let me think: for each mole of salt, perhaps it produces a certain number of moles of H2O, CO, and H2.

Let me denote:

Salt A: produces a moles H2O, b moles CO, c moles H2 per mole.

Salt B: produces d moles H2O, e moles CO, f moles H2 per mole.

Since the mixture is equimolar, let the total moles be n. So, n_A = n_B = n/2.

But this might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps A and B are the same salt, but the problem says "salts A and B", so likely different.

But perhaps it's better to think of the salts as producing specific gases.

Wait, perhaps each salt is a bicarbonate. For example, sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) upon heating decomposes into Na2CO3, CO2, and H2O. But that would produce CO2, which we don't have in the initial gas.

Hmm, this is getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should think about the problem differently.

The key is to find the total number of atoms in the original salts A and B. Since the salts are equimolar, perhaps each salt has a certain formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the salts are such that their total moles can be determined, and from there, the number of atoms can be calculated.

Wait, another approach: the problem gives the total mass of the salts as 7.20g. From the gases released, we can find the moles of each gas, and perhaps determine the moles of the salts.

So, the gases are:

H2O: 0.2 mol,

CO: 0.01 mol,

H2: 0.1 mol.

But how do these relate to the moles of salts A and B?

Assuming that each mole of salt A produces, say, x moles of H2O, y moles of CO, and z moles of H2.

Similarly for salt B.

But without knowing the exact reactions, this is difficult.

Alternatively, perhaps the salts are such that each mole produces a certain combination.

Wait, perhaps the salts are copper formate and sodium hydride.

Copper formate is Cu(HCOO)2. Upon heating, it decomposes into CuO, H2O, and CO.

The reaction would be:

Cu(HCOO)2 → CuO + H2O + CO↑.

So, per mole of Cu(HCOO)2, 1 mole of H2O and 1 mole of CO are released.

Then, sodium hydride (NaH) upon heating decomposes into Na and H2.

2 NaH → 2 Na + H2↑.

So, per mole of NaH, 0.5 mole of H2 is released.

So, if the mixture is equimolar of Cu(HCOO)2 and NaH.

Let me model this.

Let n = number of moles of each salt.

Total moles of salts: 2n.

Mass of the salts: 7.20g.

Molar masses:

Cu(HCOO)2: Cu is ~63.55, HCOO^- is (1 + 12 + 16*2) = 39 g/mol. So, the formula is Cu(HCOO)2 → 63.55 + 2*(39) = 63.55 +78 = 141.55 g/mol.

NaH: Na is ~23, H is 1 → 24 g/mol.

So, total mass: n*(141.55) + n*(24) = n*(165.55) =7.20g → n=7.20 / 165.55 ≈0.0435 mol.

So, each salt is 0.0435 mol.

Now, per mole of Cu(HCOO)2, produces 1 mole H2O and 1 mole CO.

So, for 0.0435 mol:

H2O: 0.0435 mol,

CO: 0.0435 mol.

Per mole of NaH, produces 0.5 mol H2.

So, 0.0435 mol NaH → 0.02175 mol H2.

Now, the total moles of each gas would be:

H2O: 0.0435,

CO: 0.0435,

H2: 0.02175.

But according to our earlier analysis, the moles are H2O:0.2, CO:0.01, H2:0.1.

So, this doesn't match. Hence, this assumption is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the salts are different.

Another possibility is that the salts are copper(I) oxide (Cu2O) and sodium hydride (NaH).

Cu2O upon heating decomposes into Cu and H2O:

Cu2O → 2 Cu + H2O.

So, per mole of Cu2O, 1 mole H2O is released.

NaH decomposes into Na and H2:

2 NaH → 2 Na + H2.

So, per mole of NaH, 0.5 mole H2 is released.

Assume the salts are Cu2O and NaH, in equimolar amounts.

Let n be moles of each salt.

Molar masses:

Cu2O: (63.55 * 2) + 16 = 133.1 +16 = 149.1 g/mol.

NaH: 23 +1=24 g/mol.

Total mass: n*(149.1 +24) )= n*(173.1) =7.20g → n≈7.20 /173.1 ≈0.0416 mol.

So, each salt is 0.0416 mol.

H2O from Cu2O: 0.0416 mol.

H2 from NaH: 0.0416 * 0.5 =0.0208 mol.

But according to our earlier analysis, we have more H2O and more CO. So, this isn't matching either.

Hmm, perhaps the CO comes from another source. Like, perhaps one salt releases CO and another releases H2O and H2.

Wait, another idea: perhaps one salt is copper carbonate, which upon heating releases CO2, H2O, and CuO. But earlier analysis suggested no CO2, so that's a problem.

Alternatively, perhaps the salts are such that they release CO, H2O, and H2 in specific ratios.

But perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the gases' moles and relate them to the salt's moles.

We have:

H2O: 0.2 mol,

CO: 0.01 mol,

H2: 0.1 mol.

So, total moles of gas: 0.31 mol.

Each mole of salt would contribute to these gases.

Assume that each mole of salt A produces a certain number of moles of these gases, and same for salt B.

Let me denote:

For salt A: a moles H2O, b moles CO, c moles H2 per mole.

For salt B: d moles H2O, e moles CO, f moles H2 per mole.

Since the salts are equimolar, let the moles of A and B be x each. So, total moles for each gas:

H2O: x(a + d) =0.2,

CO: x(b + e) =0.01,

H2: x(c + f) =0.1.

Also, the total mass of the salts is 7.20g:

x*(M_A + M_B) =7.20.

But without knowing M_A and M_B, it's hard to proceed.

Another approach: perhaps the salts release H2O, CO, and H2 in specific ratios.

Looking back, the initial gases are H2O, CO, H2. The moles are 0.2, 0.01, 0.1.

The ratio is 20 : 0.1 : 10 → Wait, 0.2 :0.01 :0.1 is 20:1:10.

Not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, perhaps each mole of a salt releases a certain ratio, say, 20 moles H2O, 1 mole CO, and 10 moles H2. But that's just a guess.

Alternatively, perhaps each mole of a salt releases 20 moles of H2O, which is not possible because that would require a very high molar mass.

Hmm, perhaps I should take another angle. The problem asks for the total number of atoms in salts A and B.

Each salt is made of certain atoms. The total number of atoms would be the sum of all atoms in both salts.

Perhaps the salts have simple formulas, like AB, A2B3, etc.

Wait, another idea: The total moles of each gas (H2O, CO, H2) are 0.2, 0.01, 0.1.

Assume that the moles of H2O and CO are from one salt, and H2 from another.

For example, salt A produces H2O and CO, and salt B produces H2.

So, let's say:

Salt A: produces H2O and CO.

Let x be the moles of salt A.

So, x * (a) =0.2 (H2O),

x * (b) =0.01 (CO).

Assuming 1:1 ratios, perhaps a=20, b=0.1 (but that's arbitrary).

Alternatively, perhaps each mole of A produces 20 moles H2O and 0.1 moles CO.

But that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps each mole of A produces 20 moles H2O and 1 mole CO.

So, x*(20) =0.2 → x=0.01 mol.

And x*(1) =0.01 → which matches.

So, x=0.01 mol of salt A.

Then, salt B produces H2.

Let y be moles of salt B.

y * c =0.1 → c=10 per mole.

So, y=0.01 mol (since 0.01 *10=0.1).

Thus, each salt is 0.01 mol.

But wait, the problem states that the salts are in equimolar amounts. So, if A is 0.01 mol and B is 0.01 mol, then that's equimolar. Wait, no, in this case, A and B would be same moles, which is correct.

So, total moles of salts: 0.01 +0.01=0.02 mol.

Total mass of salts: 7.20g.

So, molar mass of A: (0.2 +0.01)/0.01 = 21 → but that can't be right.

Wait, if salt A produces 0.2 mol H2O and 0.01 mol CO from 0.01 mol of A, that would imply each mole of A produces 20 moles H2O and 1 mole CO.

So, the molar mass of A would be determined by the mass of the salts.

But perhaps it's better to think of the salts' formulas.

Assume that salt A is something like CuCO3·xH2O, which upon heating releases H2O and CO.

Alternatively, perhaps salt A is CuCOOH (copper formate), which decomposes into CuO, H2O, and CO.

So, the formula for copper formate is Cu(HCOO)2.

As before, upon heating:

Cu(HCOO)2 → CuO + H2O + CO↑.

So, per mole of Cu(HCOO)2, 1 mole H2O and 1 mole CO are released.

So, in our case, from the gases, moles of CO are 0.01.

Thus, moles of A (Cu(HCOO)2) would be 0.01 mol.

So, the mass of A is 0.01 * molar mass of Cu(HCOO)2.

Molar mass: Cu is ~63.55, HCOO is 39 (as earlier). So, 63.55 + 2*(39) = 63.55 +78=141.55 g/mol.

So, mass of A: 0.01 *141.55=1.4155g.

Then, the other salt, B, must produce H2.

Assume salt B is NaH (sodium hydride), which upon heating releases H2.

Reaction: 2 NaH → 2 Na + H2↑.

So, per mole of NaH, 0.5 mole H2 is released.

In our case, H2 is 0.1 mol. So, moles of B (NaH) = 0.1 /0.5 =0.2 mol.

Mass of B: 0.2 * molar mass of NaH= 0.2 *24=4.8g.

Total mass of A and B: 1.4155 +4.8≈6.2155g. But the problem states the total mass is 7.20g. So, this doesn't match. Hence, this can't be the case.

Hmm, perhaps salt B is something else that produces H2.

Another possibility is that salt B is FeH (iron hydride), but I'm not sure about its molar mass.

Alternatively, perhaps salt B is CaH2, which upon heating releases H2.

CaH2 → Ca + H2↑.

So, per mole of CaH2, 1 mole of H2 is released.

So, moles of B (CaH2) =0.1 mol.

Molar mass of CaH2: 40 + 2=42 g/mol.

Mass of B: 0.1 *42=4.2g.

Mass of A:7.20 -4.2=3.0g.

Molar mass of A=3.0g /0.01 mol=300 g/mol. That's impossible because typical salts don't have such high molar masses.

Hmm, perhaps I'm on the wrong track.

Alternative approach: Let's think about the moles of each gas and relate them to the moles of salts.

H2O:0.2 mol,

CO:0.01 mol,

H2:0.1 mol.

Assume that each mole of salt A releases a certain number of moles of these gases.

For example, perhaps each mole of A releases 20 moles of H2O and 1 mole of CO.

So, moles of A =0.01 mol.

Then, each mole of B releases 1 mole of H2.

So, moles of B=0.1 mol.

Total moles of salts A and B:0.01 +0.1=0.11 mol.

Mass of salts:7.20g.

Average molar mass:7.20 /0.11≈65.45 g/mol.

This suggests that the salts have an average molar mass around 65 g/mol.

But without knowing their exact formulas, it's hard to proceed.

Alternatively, perhaps the salts are CuCO3 and NaH.

Wait, but CuCO3 would release CO2, which we don't have in the initial gas.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the salts are copper(I) oxide (Cu2O) and sodium hydride (NaH).

Cu2O → 2 Cu + H2O.

So, per mole of Cu2O, 1 mole H2O is released.

NaH → produces H2.

So, moles of Cu2O:0.2 mol (H2O).

Molar mass of Cu2O:149.1 g/mol.

Mass of A (Cu2O)=0.2 *149.1=29.82g. Which is way higher than our total of 7.20g.

So, no.

Hmm, perhaps the salts are different. Let me think about another possibility.

Wait, let's think about the reaction in tube 3 again. The mass increase is 0.80g of CuO. So, 0.01 mol of CuO. If the reaction is CO + Cu → CuO + C, then for each mole of CO, one mole of CuO is formed. So, 0.01 mol CO reacted.

So, the initial amount of CO after tube 1 is 0.01 mol. Because all of it was consumed in tube 3.

So, initial CO is 0.01 mol.

Then, the initial gases are H2O (0.2 mol), CO (0.01 mol), and H2 (0.1 mol).

Now, considering the salts: each mole of salt produces some amount of these gases.

Assume that salt A produces H2O and CO, and salt B produces H2.

Let me think of salt A as producing both H2O and CO.

Suppose each mole of salt A produces 20 moles H2O and 1 mole CO.

So, moles of A=0.01.

Then, salt B produces 0.1 mol H2. So, if each mole of salt B produces 1 mole H2, then moles of B=0.1.

Total moles of salts:0.01 +0.1=0.11 mol.

Total mass:7.20g → average molar mass ≈65.45 g/mol.

But this doesn't directly help unless I find the molar masses of salts A and B.

Alternatively, perhaps the salts are such that each mole produces H2O and CO in a 20:1 ratio.

But without knowing their formulas, it's challenging.

Wait, perhaps the salts are sodium formate (NaHCOO) and sodium hydride (NaH).

Sodium formate upon heating decomposes as:

2 NaHCOO → Na2CO3 + H2O + CO↑.

So, per 2 moles of NaHCOO, 1 mole H2O and 1 mole CO are produced.

So, moles of NaHCOO = 2 * moles of CO = 2 *0.01=0.02 mol.

So, mass of NaHCOO:0.02 * (23 + 16 + 12 + 1 +1 +16)= let me calculate the molar mass.

NaHCOO: Na (23) + H (1) + C (12) + O (16) *2 → 23+1+12+32=68 g/mol.

So, mass of NaHCOO is 0.02 *68=1.36g.

Then, the other salt, NaH, produces H2.

NaH upon heating: 2 NaH →2 Na + H2↑.

So, moles of NaH= 0.1 mol H2 /0.5 =0.2 mol.

Mass of NaH:0.2 *24=4.8g.

Total mass of salts:1.36 +4.8=6.16g. Which is less than 7.20g.

So, this isn't matching.

Hmm, perhaps there's another component.

Wait, maybe the salts are a mixture of something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the salts are copper(II) formate and another compound.

But I'm not making progress here. Maybe I should think about the total number of atoms.

The options are 13,15,17,19.

Each salt contributes a certain number of atoms. Let's think about the possible formulas.

For example, if a salt has a formula like Cu(HCOO)2, which has 1 Cu, 2 HCOO groups. Each HCOO has 2 O and 1 C and 1 H. So, per mole of Cu(HCOO)2:

Cu:1,

H:2,

C:2,

O:4.

So, total atoms per mole:1+2+2+4=9.

Wait, no: the formula is Cu(HCOO)2.

Each HCOO is H, C, O2. So, two HCOO groups give:

H:2,

C:2,

O:4.

Plus the Cu:1.

So, per mole, 1+2+2+4=9 atoms.

Similarly, sodium hydride (NaH) has 2 atoms per mole.

If the salts are Cu(HCOO)2 and NaH, and each has 0.01 mol.

Then, total atoms:

Cu(HCOO)2:0.01 *9=0.09.

NaH:0.01 *2=0.02.

Total atoms:0.11 →11 atoms.

But the options don't have 11. Hmm.

Alternatively, if the moles are different.

Wait, earlier when we thought that moles of A and B are 0.01 and 0.2, but that gave a total mass of 6.16g, which is less than 7.20g.

Alternatively, perhaps the salts have more atoms.

Another possibility: the salts are Na2CO3·H2O and NaH.

Na2CO3·H2O upon heating would decompose into Na2CO3 and H2O.

But in this case, the gas would be H2O, which aligns with our initial analysis.

So, perhaps:

Salt A: Na2CO3·H2O → upon heating, releases H2O.

Salt B: NaH → releases H2.

But then, where does the CO come from? Because in our initial analysis, CO is present.

Hmm, perhaps another salt.

Wait, perhaps the salts are Na2CO3·2H2O (sodium carbonate decahydrate?) No, wait, Na2CO3·H2O is the formula upon dehydration.

Alternatively, perhaps the salts are not the ones I'm thinking of.

Wait, perhaps the salts are Na2CO3·nH2O and something else.

But I'm not making progress. Perhaps I should think of the total number of atoms in the salts being 17.

If each salt has 17 atoms per mole, then 7.20g / (molar mass) would give moles, and multiplied by 17 gives total atoms.

But without knowing the molar mass, it's hard.

Alternatively, perhaps each salt has a formula with a certain number of atoms.

Wait, for the options, 17 is an option (C).

Wait, another approach: the gases produced are 0.2 H2O, 0.01 CO, 0.1 H2.

The total moles of gas:0.31.

Assuming that the salts are such that each mole produces a certain number of moles of gas.

For example, if each mole of salt A produces 20 moles of H2O and 1 mole of CO, and each mole of salt B produces 10 moles of H2.

So, moles of A:0.01,

moles of B:0.01.

Total moles of salts:0.02.

Total atoms per mole for each salt:

Salt A: Let's say it's Cu(HCOO)2.

Each mole has 1 Cu, 2 H, 2 C, 4 O → total 9 atoms.

Salt B: let's say it's NaH, each mole has 2 atoms.

So, total atoms: (0.01 *9) + (0.01 *2) =0.11→11 atoms. Not matching any option.

Alternatively, perhaps the salts are different.

Another possibility: The salts are CuCO3 and NaH. But CuCO3 upon heating would release CO2, which we don't have.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the salts are KClO3 and FeH.

But no, KClO3 decomposes into KCl and O2.

Hmm, perhaps this is taking too long, and I should try to find another way.

Another angle: the total number of atoms in salts A and B.

Suppose each salt has a formula with a certain number of atoms. Let’s think:

If each salt is a binary compound, like AB, then each mole has 2 atoms.

If it's A2B3, each mole has 5 atoms.

The options are 13, 15, 17, 19.

So, perhaps the salts together have a total of 17 atoms.

But how?

Wait, perhaps each salt has 8.5 atoms on average, but that's not possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the salts are of different types.

Assume:

Salt A has 13 atoms per mole.

Salt B has 4 atoms per mole.

Total per mole: 17.

But 7.20g of salts would have a certain number of moles.

Alternatively, perhaps the salts have the same number of atoms.

But without knowing their formulas, it's hard.

Wait, perhaps the total number of atoms is 17. Let's see.

If the salts are in equimolar amounts, and each mole contributes a certain number of atoms.

Let’s say each salt has n atoms per mole, and there are m moles of each.

So, total atoms: 2 * m * n.

We have 2 * m *n = ?

But without knowing m and n, it's hard.

But given the options, 17 is a prime number. So, perhaps it's a single salt with 17 atoms per mole, but that's unlikely.

Alternatively, the salts together have 17 atoms.

Wait, another approach: Each salt contributes a certain number of atoms.

If the salts are NaH and Cu(OH)2.

NaH: 2 atoms per mole.

Cu(OH)2: 4 atoms per mole.

Assuming equimolar.

Molar mass:

NaH=24 g/mol,

Cu(OH)2=90 g/mol.

Total mass for x moles of each: x*(24 +90)= x*114=7.20 → x=7.20 /114≈0.06316 mol.

Total atoms:

NaH:0.06316 *2=0.1263,

Cu(OH)2:0.06316 *4=0.2526,

Total=0.3789 atoms. No, that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of moles.

Alternatively, perhaps the salts are Na2CO3 and NaH.

Wait, Na2CO3 has 2 Na, 1 C, 3 O →6 atoms.

NaH:2 atoms.

If they are equimolar, each with x moles.

Total atoms: x*(6 +2 )=8x.

Total mass: x*(142 +24)=x*166=7.20 →x=0.04337 mol.

Total atoms:8 *0.04337≈0.347 →347 atoms. No, the options are in the teens.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps each salt is a metal with a high number of atoms.

But I'm stuck. Perhaps I should look for another approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is about the dehydration of a metal bicarbonate, which releases CO2, H2O, and CO. But again, since we don't have CO2 in the initial gas, that's not possible.

Alternative idea: the initial gases are H2O, CO, and H2. The fact that tube 2 didn't gain mass suggests no CO2. So, the salts must decompose into these gases and some solid residue.

Assume that the salts are copper(I) carbonate (Cu2CO3) and sodium hydride (NaH).

Wait, Cu2CO3 upon heating would decompose into CuO, CO2, and H2O. But again, this would produce CO2, which we don't have.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the salts are copper(I) oxide and sodium hydride.

Cu2O → 2 Cu + H2O.

NaH → H2.

So:

H2O: comes from Cu2O,

H2: comes from NaH.

But where does CO come from? We have 0.01 mol CO.

So, maybe another salt produces CO.

Wait, perhaps salt A is CuO·HCOO (some formate), which upon heating releases CO and H2O.

So, perhaps the salts are:

A: Cu(HCOO)2 → releases H2O and CO.

B: NaH → releases H2.

Assume:

Moles of A:0.01 (since CO is 0.01),

Molar mass of A:141.55 g/mol → mass of A=1.4155g.

Moles of B:0.1 mol H2 /0.5 =0.2 mol.

Mass of B:0.2 *24=4.8g.

Total mass:1.4155 +4.8=6.2155g, which is less than 7.20g. So, discrepancy of ~1g.

So, perhaps there's another component or perhaps the initial assumption is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the salts are not equimolar in terms of moles but in terms of molar amounts.

Wait, the problem says 'equimolar mixture of salts A and B', meaning equal moles of A and B.

So, let me denote n as moles of A and n as moles of B.

So, total moles of A and B: 2n.

Each mole of A and B contributes to the gases.

Assume:

Each mole of A produces a moles H2O, b moles CO, c moles H2.

Each mole of B produces d moles H2O, e moles CO, f moles H2.

But without knowing a, b, c, d, e, f, it's impossible to proceed.

But perhaps we can make some assumptions.

Assume that A produces H2O and CO.

B produces H2.

Thus:

For A:

n*(a + d) =0.2 (H2O),

n*(b + e) =0.01 (CO),

n*(c + f) =0.1 (H2).

But without knowing a, d, etc., it's hard.

Alternatively, perhaps A produces H2O and CO, B produces H2.

So:

n*(a) =0.2,

n*(b) =0.01,

n*(f) =0.1.

Assuming that A doesn't produce H2, and B produces only H2.

So:

a=0.2/n,

b=0.01/n,

f=0.1/n.

But again, without knowing n, it's hard.

But the total mass is:

n*M_A +n*M_B=7.20.

M_A and M_B are molar masses.

But without knowing M_A and M_B, it's challenging.

Another angle: the total number of atoms in the salts.

Each mole of a salt contributes a certain number of atoms.

If the salts are A and B, each with a formula that has a certain number of atoms per mole.

Let me think of possible formulas:

For example:

A: Cu(HCOO)2 → 1 Cu, 2 H, 2 C, 4 O → 9 atoms per mole.

B: NaH → 2 atoms per mole.

So, per mole of each salt, total atoms: 9 + 2 =11.

If there are n moles of each, total atoms:11 *n.

But we don't know n.

But the total mass is n*(141.55 +24)=n*165.55=7.20 →n=7.20/165.55≈0.04345 mol.

Total atoms:11 *0.04345≈0.478 atoms. No, that's not possible.

Wait, perhaps the number of atoms per mole is different.

Another possibility: each salt has 17 atoms per mole. So, for 0.04345 mol, 0.04345 *17≈0.738 atoms. Not matching the options.

Hmm, perhaps the total number of atoms is 17.

Wait, another approach: think of each salt's molar mass and the number of atoms they contribute.

Assume that each salt has a molar mass M and contributes 'a' atoms per mole.

The problem is to find the sum of all atoms in A and B.

The total mass is 7.20g.

The total moles of salts is (7.20)/M.

Total atoms: (7.20/M) *a.

We need (7.20/M)*a to be one of the options.

But without knowing M and a, it's impossible.

Hmm.

Another angle: perhaps each salt is a diatomic molecule, but that's unlikely for salts.

Alternatively, perhaps the salts have a combined formula that results in 17 atoms.

Wait, perhaps each salt has 8.5 atoms on average, but that's not practical.

Alternatively, the salts are such that:

Salt A: 13 atoms per mole,

Salt B: 4 atoms per mole,

Total:17.

But again, without knowing their molar masses, it's hard.

At this point, perhaps I should look for the correct answer based on the options, but I'm not fully confident.

Wait, the gases are H2O, CO, H2. The moles are 0.2, 0.01, 0.1.

The total moles of gas is 0.31.

Assuming R =0.0821 L·atm/mol·K,

At STP (0°C, 1 atm), 1 mole is 22.4 L.

But the problem states that after all reactions, 2.24 L (0.1 mol) of gas C remains.

Assuming gas C is H2, which is 0.1 mol.

So, the initial moles of H2 was 0.1, and it didn't react.

The CO was 0.01 mol, all consumed in tube 3.

The H2O was 0.2 mol, all absorbed in tube 1.

So, the salts decomposed to produce these gases.

Assuming the salts are equimolar, let me think of their possible formulas.

Assume each mole of salt A produces 20 moles H2O and 1 mole CO.

Each mole of salt B produces 10 moles H2.

So, moles of A:0.01,

moles of B:0.01.

Total moles:0.02.

Mass of A and B:7.20g.

Average molar mass:7.20 /0.02=360 g/mol. That's too high.

Hmm, perhaps each mole of salt A produces 20 moles H2O and 1 mole CO, and each mole of salt B produces 1 mole H2.

So, moles of A:0.01,

moles of B:0.1.

Total moles:0.11.

Average molar mass:7.20 /0.11≈65.45 g/mol.

So, salts have molar masses around 65 g/mol.

If salt A has molar mass M_A, and salt B M_B,

0.01*M_A +0.1*M_B=7.20.

But without more info, I can't proceed.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the options.

The options are 13, 15, 17, 19.

I think the correct answer is 17, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I'll go with option C) 17.


The problem involves heating an equimolar mixture of salts A and B (7.20 g) at 200°C, producing a gas mixture. The gases pass through three tubes:

1. **Tube 1 (Mg(ClO₄)₂):** Absorbs water vapor, increasing mass by 3.60 g. This corresponds to 0.2 mol of H₂O.
2. **Tube 2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** No change in mass, indicating no CO₂ was present in the gas after tube 1.
3. **Tube 3 (red-hot copper):** Absorbs gas, increasing mass by 0.80 g (0.01 mol of CuO). This suggests CO reacts with Cu to form CuO.
4. **Remaining gas:** 2.24 L (0.1 mol) of gas C at STP, likely H₂.

### Key Observations:
- **H₂O:** 0.2 mol (from tube 1).
- **CO:** 0.01 mol (consumed in tube 3 to form CuO).
- **H₂:** 0.1 mol (remaining gas after all reactions).

### Analysis of Salts:
The salts A and B are equimolar and produce the observed gases upon heating. Based on the gas data:
- Salt A likely produces H₂O and CO.
- Salt B likely produces H₂.

#### Example Salts:
1. **Salt A:** Could be copper formate (Cu(HCOO)₂), which decomposes into CuO, H₂O, and CO.
   - Molar mass: ~141.55 g/mol.
   - Moles of A: 0.01 mol (produces 0.01 mol CO and 0.01 mol H₂O).
   - Mass of A: 0.01 × 141.55 ≈ 1.4155 g.
2. **Salt B:** Could be sodium hydride (NaH), which decomposes into Na and H₂.
   - Molar mass: 24 g/mol.
   - Moles of B: 0.1 mol (produces 0.1 mol H₂).
   - Mass of B: 0.1 × 24 = 4.8 g.

#### Total Mass Check:
- Total mass of salts: 1.4155 g + 4.8 g ≈ 6.2155 g.
- The problem states the total mass is 7.20 g, suggesting additional components or slight discrepancies in assumptions.

### Total Number of Atoms:
- **Salt A (Cu(HCOO)₂):** Each mole contains 1 Cu, 2 H, 2 C, and 4 O → 9 atoms/mol.
  - Moles of A: 0.01 mol → 0.01 × 9 = 0.09 atoms.
- **Salt B (NaH):** Each mole contains 1 Na and 1 H → 2 atoms/mol.
  - Moles of B: 0.1 mol → 0.1 × 2 = 0.2 atoms.
- **Total atoms:** 0.09 + 0.2 = 0.29 atoms.

Given the options (13, 15, 17, 19), the most plausible answer based on the reasoning and approximations is **17**.
