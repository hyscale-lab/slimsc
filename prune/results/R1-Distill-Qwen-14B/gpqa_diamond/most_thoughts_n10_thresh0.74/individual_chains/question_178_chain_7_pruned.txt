Okay, so I have this question about a Lagrangian and whether the theory is renormalizable. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to work through it.

The Lagrangian given is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. Oh right, σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]. I remember that the gamma matrices have certain dimensions and properties. 

Wait, to find the mass dimension of κ, I think I need to figure out the dimension of each term in the Lagrangian. The Lagrangian has to have mass dimension 4 because it's integrated over four dimensions in the action, so the action is dimensionless. So each term in the Lagrangian should be dimension 4.

Let me break down the components. The term is κ times ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. I need to find the mass dimensions of each part.

I remember that the fermion fields ψ have mass dimension 3/2. Because in four dimensions, for a Dirac spinor, [ψ]_M = 3/2. So ψ̄ would also have 3/2.

What about σ_{μν}? Let's see. Since σ_{μν} is (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν], and the gamma matrices γ have dimension 1, because they're like differential operators multiplied by functions, so [γ^μ]_M = 1. The commutator of two gamma matrices would still have dimension 1 (since it's a product of two gamma matrices subtracted, same dimension). So σ_{μν} would have dimension 1.

Now, F^{μν} is the field strength tensor of electromagnetism. Wait, no, wait. Wait, F^{μν} is usually for electromagnetism, which is a tensor made from derivatives of the gauge field. The gauge field A has dimension 1, so ∂_μ A_ν has dimension 2. And F is ∂_μ A_ν - ∂_ν A_μ, so dimension 2.

So putting it all together. The term is ψ̄ (dim 3/2) times σ_{μν} (dim 1) times ψ (dim 3/2) times F^{μν} (dim 2). Let's add those dimensions: 3/2 + 1 + 3/2 + 2.

Wait, 3/2 + 3/2 is 3. Plus 1 is 4, plus 2 is 6. So the entire product has dimension 6. But the Lagrangian term must have dimension 4. So the κ must have a dimension that brings the whole thing down to 4.

So [κ ψ̄ σ ψ F] = [κ] + [ψ̄] + [σ] + [ψ] + [F] = [κ] + 3/2 +1 +3/2 +2. Let me calculate that. 3/2 + 3/2 is 3; plus
