Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this problem about electron microscopes and mean free paths. Hmm, let me start by understanding the scenario.

Mike is using a high-resolution transmission electron microscope at 1000 kV. He connected vacuum pumps to get an ultra-high vacuum, less than 10^-9 Torr. The idea is to have minimal gas molecules because that improves electron microscopy. But even then, some gas particles are still there, as detected by a mass spectrometer. 

He calculated the mean free path of these gas molecules in the vacuum state as λ1, considering factors like the sample compartment volume, pressure, and temperature. So the mean free path is the average distance a molecule travels between collisions, right? I remember the formula for mean free path is λ = (k*T) / (sqrt(2)*π*d²*P), where k is Boltzmann's constant, T temperature, d the diameter of the molecules, and P pressure. Or maybe it's another formula. Wait, another version is λ = 1/(√2 * n * σ), where n is the number density and σ is the collision cross-section. But maybe I should think about the factors that affect the mean free path.

Now, when he starts the electron beam, he notices that the mean free path isn't λ1 anymore; it's λ2. And the temperature is the same, so T didn't change. So why would the mean free path change?

Wait, the mean free path in the gas is determined by how often the gas molecules collide with each other. But when the electron beam is on, perhaps the gas molecules are interacting with the electrons. So, the electrons are high-energy, moving fast, and they might cause the gas molecules to ionize or collide more.

Wait, but the electron beam would make the gas molecules lose electrons (ionization) or gain, depending on the gas. Or maybe the electrons cause the gas molecules to move, perhaps increasing their kinetic energy. If the gas molecules are ionized, they become charged, which affects how they move. 

But how does that affect their mean free path? Let me think. The mean free path in the original calculation (λ1) was based on the gas molecules colliding with each other. But when the electron beam is on, the electrons are another factor. The electrons can cause the gas molecules to scatter, which would change their mean free path.

In other words, the presence of the electron beam introduces another source of scattering. Previously, the mean free path was determined by gas-gas collisions, but now gas-electron collisions are also happening. So the gas molecules are now colliding not just with each other but also with the electrons.

So the effective mean free path λ2 would be shorter because there are more collisions. Because if you're colliding with electrons more often, the average distance between any two collisions (whether gas-gas or gas-electron) would be shorter than before.

Let me think about the formula. The mean free path is inversely proportional to the collision rate. The collision rate increases when there are more particles (in this case, electrons) present as targets for collisions. So if the presence of the electron beam adds more particles (the electrons), the number density for collision purposes increases. Or wait, is it the electrons that are moving and causing collisions with the gas molecules?

Alternatively, perhaps the electrons are moving so fast that the gas molecules are stationary relative to them. So each gas molecule has a higher chance of being hit by an electron than another gas molecule. So the effective collision rate increases, leading to a shorter mean free path.

So λ2 would be less than λ1 because the mean free path is now shorter. So the correct option would be C) λ2 < λ1.

Wait, but let me think about it another way. The mean free path is the average distance a molecule travels between collisions. If the electron beam is causing more frequent collisions, the mean free path would decrease. So λ2 should be smaller than λ1. So the correct answer is C.


When designing a high-resolution transmission electron microscope, Mike achieved an ultra-high vacuum in the sample compartment, with a mean free path of gas molecules determined as λ1. Upon initiating the electron beam, he observed a new mean free path, λ2, which deviated from λ1. This change can be explained by the additional interactions between the high-energy electron beam and the gas molecules.

The mean free path is the average distance a molecule travels between collisions. Initially, λ1 was calculated based on gas-gas collisions. However, when the electron beam is activated, the gas molecules interact with the electrons, introducing an additional source of collisions. These gas-electron collisions occur more frequently than gas-gas collisions, as the electrons are fast-moving and numerous. This increased collision rate reduces the effective mean free path, leading to λ2 being shorter than λ1.

Thus, the correct conclusion is that λ2 < λ1.

Answer: C
