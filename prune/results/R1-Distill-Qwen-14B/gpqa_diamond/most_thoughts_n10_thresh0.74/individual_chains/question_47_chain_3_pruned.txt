Okay, so I've got this problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about identifying a compound based on its spectroscopic data. The molecular formula is C9H11NO2. The options are four different organic compounds. Let me start by looking at the IR and NMR data given.

First, the IR data. The strong bands around 3420 and 3325 cm-ยน. Those are usually indicative of N-H stretching. The medium to strong intensity suggests that there are two sets of N-H groups, maybe in an amine or amide. Wait, but amines have broad peaks around 3300-3500. So maybe it's an amide because amides have N-H stretches, but they are usually less intense than amines because the N-H in amides is less basic. Or perhaps it's a primary amine. Also, the strong band at 1720 cm-ยน. That's a typical carbonyl stretch. Could be an ester, amide, ketone, or maybe an aldehyde. But esters usually have that around 1740-1720, so that fits. So maybe an ester group is present.

Looking at the options:

Option A) 3-ethoxybenzamide. Benzamide would have an amide group. So the IR would show both N-H (amide) and a carbonyl. The ethoxy group would contribute O-H in IR? No, ethoxy is an ether; their O-H is usually not present. Wait, no, ethoxy is O-R, so no O-H. So the IR would have N-H (amide) and a carbonyl. That's possible.

Option B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Formamide has a CONH2 group. The IR would show the N-H stretches for the amide. The carbonyl would be around 1720, which fits. Also, the ethoxy group would have an ether C-O stretch, which I don't see in the given IR data, but maybe it's not highlighted here.

Option C) 4-aminophenyl propionate. Propionate is an ester (CH2CH2COO-). The amine would have N-H stretches. But wait, the molecular formula for option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate would be something like PhNH2-CO-OCH2CH2CH3? Or wait, phenyl propionate would be benzene ring connected to a propionate ester. But if it's 4-aminophenyl propionate, the structure is probably Ph-NH2-CO-O-R? Or wait, maybe it's the other way. Alternatively, maybe the structure is benzene with NH2 and a propionate ester group. Hmm, wait, the molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Let me see each option's formula.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the molecular formulas of each option to see if they match C9H11NO2.

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Benzamide is C7H7NO. Ethoxy is OCH2CH3. So the structure would be OCH2CH2 attached to the benzene. Wait, wait: benzamide is C6H5CONH2. But 3-ethoxy would be substituting on the benzene ring. So the structure would be C6H5 with OCH2CH3 at position 3, and the benzamide group (CONH2) at position 3? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me count the carbons: Benzene is 6 carbons, ethoxy is 2 (from OCH2CH3), then the benzamide has a CONH2, which adds another carbon (the carbonyl carbon). So total carbons: 6 (benzene) + 2 (ethoxy) + 1 (amide) = 9. Hydrogen? Let me see: Benzene (5 H), ethoxy contributes 5 H (two in OCH2 and two in CH3?), wait wait. Wait, wait, OCH2CH3 has 2+3=5 H. But in the benzene ring, if it's 3-ethoxy, then one substituent is ethoxy, another is CONH2. So the benzene would have four substituent positions? No, because benzamide has the amide group as a substituent. Wait, perhaps the structure is benzamide (C6H5CONH2) but with an ethoxy group in the 3 position. So the formula would be C9H11NO2? Let me count: C: 6 (benzene) + 2 (ethoxy) + 1 (amide's carbonyl) + N and O from the amide (which is one N and two O). So total C: 6+2+1 = 9, H: let's think. Benzene ring: if the substituents are ethoxy and CONH2, that's two substituents. So the ring has four H. Ethoxy contributes 5 H (OCH2CH3). The amide group is CONH2, which has 2 H. So 4 (ring) +5 (ethoxy) +2 (amide) = 11 H. Nitrogen: 1 in amide. Oxygen: 2 in ethoxy (O) and 2 in amide (O), but wait, ethoxy is O attached to CH2CH3, which is one O. Benzamide has a CONH2: so carbonyl O and amide O? Wait, no, CONH2 has one O. So total O in the molecule would be O from ethoxy (1) and O from amide (1) = 2 O. So yes, the formula is C9H11NO2. So option A matches.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Formamide is HCONH2. So the group would be HCO-NH- attached to the benzene ring. Wait, structure would be benzene with ethoxy at 4-position and formamide at another position. Wait, perhaps it's OMe (ethoxy) at 4, and the formamide (HCO-NH-) as a substituent, perhaps at 4 position as well? Or another position? Let me think about the formula. Benzene (6 C) + ethoxy (2 C) + formamide (HCONH2: 2 C (formyl and amide)). Wait, formamide is HCONH2, which has 2 carbons (the HCO part). So total C
