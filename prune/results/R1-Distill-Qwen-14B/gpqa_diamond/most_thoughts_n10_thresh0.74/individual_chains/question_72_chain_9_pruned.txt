Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Hmm, let's see. The question involves a series of reactions starting from 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene and going through several steps to form product 4. The final question is about the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in product 4.

Alright, let me break this down step by step.

First, let's look at the starting material: 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. Bicyclo[2.2.1]heptadiene is a norbornene structure, right? So, it's a bridged bicyclic compound. The substituent is a tert-butoxy group at position 7. So the structure is norbornene with an oxygen connected to a tert-butyl group.

Next, the first reaction is combining this with two equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide at elevated temperature. Wait, sodium iodide is a good nucleophile source, and dibromomethyl groups are leaving groups. So this might be a coupling reaction or some kind of substitution.

Looking at 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene, each of the 5 and 6 positions has a CH2Br2 group. Oh wait no, each is CH2Br, but wait, the formula is 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl), which I think is each CH2 with two bromines. So each substituent is CH2Br2? Or is it CH2Br attached to each of carbons 5 and 6?

Wait, the structure is cyclohexa-1,3-diene, so it's a conjugated diene. The substituents on carbons 5 and 6 are each dibromomethyl groups. So each substituent is CH2Br2? No, wait, dibromomethyl would be CH2Br2, but that doesn't make sense because CH2Br2 would have two bromines on a single carbon. Oh, perhaps each substituent is a CH2 group with two bromines, like BrCH2Br? No, that's not possible because that would be a geminal dihalide, which is possible but maybe in a different context. Alternatively, maybe each substituent is a bromomethyl group (CH2Br) and the other substituent is another bromomethyl. So, each of the 5 and 6 positions have a CH2Br group. So the molecule is cyclohexa-1,3-diene with two CH2Br substituents on adjacent carbons (5 and 6).

Wait, but the reaction is using 2 equivalents of that compound. And sodium iodide is probably acting as a source of iodide ions, which would displace the bromide in an elimination reaction. So maybe it's a coupling via elimination? Or a substitution where each Br is replaced.

Alternatively, considering the structure of norbornene, which is bicyclic, maybe a Diels-Alder reaction? Wait, but the other compound is a diene as well. So perhaps the first step is a Diels-Alder reaction between the norbornene diene and another diene? Wait, no, the starting material is 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. So the bicyclo structure has two double bonds: positions 2 and 5, so it's a diene. The other compound is 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene, which is also a diene.

Wait, but wait, the Diels-Alder requires a diene and a dienophile. Alternatively, perhaps it's a [4+2] cycloaddition, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a coupling via elimination.

Wait, the reaction involves NaI. So perhaps each of the CH2Br groups is undergoing substitution with the norbornene's substituent. Alternatively, perhaps the norbornene is acting as a nucleophile.

Wait, the starting molecule has an ether group (tert-butoxy). When you have substitution, the tert-butoxy is a good leaving group? No, because it's an oxygen. Wait, substitution reactions in ethers are not typical. Unless it's an elimination, but that would require a different setup.

Alternatively, considering that the starting molecule is a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptadiene, maybe it's acting as a diene in a Diels-Alder reaction. The other molecule is a dienophile. Wait, but the other molecule is another diene. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the first step is a ring-opening of the norbornene. But norbornene isn't easily ring-opened under such conditions. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is involved in a substitution reaction.

Wait, maybe the NaI is a source of iodide, which could perform a nucleophilic substitution on the dihalide. So the 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene has two CH2Br groups. Maybe each Br is replaced by something else.

Wait, the starting molecule, norbornene, has a tert-butoxy group. But that's on the bicyclo structure. Alternatively, maybe the diene in the starting material is reacting with the dienophile, which is the 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene. Wait, but both are dienes, so perhaps the other molecule is acting as a dienophile? Or maybe the other way around.

Wait, perhaps the 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene acts as a dienophile
