Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question again.

The problem says: Find the kinetic energy of the product particles in the decay Pi(+) = mu(+) + nu. The pion is stationary. The rest masses are given: Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV, and mu(+) is 105.7 MeV. The options are A to D, each with two numbers, which I assume are the kinetic energies of the muon and neutrino.

Hmm, right. So this is a decay process where a pion at rest decays into a muon and a neutrino. Since the pion is at rest, its initial momentum is zero. So the total momentum of the products must also be zero. That means the muon and neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta. So their momenta are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction.

I remember that in such decays, the energy and momentum are conserved. Since the pion is at rest, its total energy is just its rest mass energy, which is 139.6 MeV. The products, muon and neutrino, must share this energy.

Wait, but the neutrino is massless, I think. Or at least, for the sake of these problems, we usually assume neutrinos have negligible mass. So the neutrino's mass can be considered zero.

So, let's think about energy conservation. The total energy after decay is the sum of the muon's energy and the neutrino's energy. The total energy must equal the pion's rest energy: 139.6 MeV.

But the muon's energy is its rest energy plus its kinetic energy. The neutrino's energy is just its kinetic energy because its rest mass is zero.

So, let me denote:

E_mu = m_mu * c² + K_mu
E_nu = K_nu

And the total energy is E_mu + E_nu = m_pi c².

So, (105.7 + K_mu) + K_nu = 139.6.

But wait, what about momentum? Since the pion is at rest, the total momentum is zero. So the muon and neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta.

The muon's momentum p_mu is given by sqrt( (E_mu/c²)^2 c^4 - (m_mu c²)^2 ) / c. Or more simply, p = sqrt(E^2 - m^2 c^4)/(c). Wait, units can get a bit confusing, but since we're dealing in MeV and MeV/c², perhaps it's better to express everything in units where c=1. So, p_mu = sqrt(E_mu² - m_mu²) and p_nu = sqrt(E_nu² - m_nu²). But since m_nu is zero, p_nu = E_nu.

But since the momenta are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction, p_mu = p_nu.

So, sqrt(E_mu² - (105.7)^2 ) = E_nu.

Hmm, but E_mu is (105.7 + K_mu), right? And E_nu is K_n
