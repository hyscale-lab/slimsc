Okay, let's tackle this Grubbs catalyst question. Hmm, I remember Grubbs is used for olefin metathesis. So, the starting material is racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Wait, what's the structure of that?

3-methylpent-1-ene would be CH2=CH-C(CH3)H-CH2-CH3? Wait, no. Wait, pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3, but with a methyl branch on the third carbon. So the structure is CH2=CH-C(CH3)H-CH2? Wait, no, wait. Let me draw it out. Pent has five carbons. So position 1 is the double bond start. So structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH2CH3)-? No wait, wait. Wait, 3-methylpent-1-ene: the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-? No, wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, maybe it's CH2=CH-CH(CH2CH3)-something? No, no. Wait, the formula for 3-methylpent-1-ene. Pent has five carbons. The double bond is between 1 and 2. So carbon 1: CH2=, carbon 2: CH-, carbon 3: CH(CH3), and the rest. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, wait, that can't be right because that would be five
