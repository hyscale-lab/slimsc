Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem describes a series of reactions with substances A through H. The question is about the molecular symmetry group of product E. The options are symmetry groups like C2, D4h, D∞h, and C2v.

First, I think I need to identify each compound based on the reactions described. Let's break down each reaction.

The first reaction is solid A reacting with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. Hmm, 8 equivalents suggests a ratio of 1:8, but I'm not sure what that means yet. Bright red product C—maybe something like a transition metal compound, perhaps a sulfide or oxide? Wait, bright red often makes me think of things like copper(II) ions, which are blue, but maybe something else. Alternatively, maybe a chromium compound? Or perhaps it's related to sulfur. Alternatively, could C be a complex ion?

Next, C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce product E, which is extremely hazardous. So, C plus D in a 1:2 ratio gives E. That's a clue. Also, when C is treated with water, it reforms A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. So, C reacting with water produces a solid (A), and two acids.

Hmm, when a solid reacts with water to produce a solid and two acids, perhaps C is a sulfide? Let me think. If A is a metal sulfide, then reacting with water would produce H2S, but H2S is a weak acid. Wait, no, H2S is a weak acid, but F is a strong acid. Alternatively, maybe C is a nitride? Because when nitrides react with water, they can produce NH3 (a weak base, but maybe in the reaction, it's considered as part of the product with acid? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps C is a chloride, but I don't know. Wait, another thought: if C is a sulfite or sulfate, but that might not explain the two different acids. Alternatively, maybe C is a carbonate? Carbonates when reacted with water don't produce acids but rather release CO2 and form the corresponding base. Hmm, not matching.

Wait, let's think about another approach. The second reaction: C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to form E, which is extremely hazardous. What's a common extremely hazardous gas? Maybe chlorine? Or perhaps something like phosgene? Or maybe D is H2O? No, H2O is a liquid. Alternatively, D could be a halogen, but let's think about the reactions.

Wait, another reaction: D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent. Solvents could be something like ethanol, methanol, water, etc. Let me think: D plus B in 1:1 gives H as a solvent. If B is a gas, maybe B is something like O2 or H2. Wait, but D is a gas as well. So, D and B gas reacting 1:1 to form a solvent. What if D is H2O (but that's a liquid), or maybe D is something else. Alternatively, perhaps B is H2 and D is Cl2? But then H would
