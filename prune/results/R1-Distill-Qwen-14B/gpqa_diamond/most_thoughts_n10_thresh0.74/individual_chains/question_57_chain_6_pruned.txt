Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about elastic scattering of electrons from a nuclear target. Hmm, elastic scattering—I remember that from my notes. The question is about calculating the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. Oh right, the scattering amplitude is a concept from quantum mechanics, involving things like partial waves and phase shifts.

Wait, the measured phase shifts are given: δ₀=90°, δ₁=67°, δ₂=55°, δ₃=30°, and δ₄=13°. And they say to ignore the rest of the phase shifts beyond δ₄. So I guess that means the higher-order phase shifts (like δ₅ and beyond) are zero or negligible, so we can ignore them.

The incident electrons have an energy of 50 MeV. Hmm, but wait, the energy might be used to find other parameters like the wavelength or something related to the scattering amplitude. Or maybe the energy isn't directly needed because the question is about the form of the scattering amplitude.

I remember that the scattering amplitude f(θ) can be expressed as a sum over all the partial waves. Each partial wave contributes with a term involving the spherical Bessel functions and the phase shifts. The general formula I recall is something like:

f(θ) = (1/k) Σ [ (2l + 1) (sin δ_l - δ_l) e^{i l (θ)} ]

Wait, not quite. Let me think. Oh right, in partial wave analysis, the scattering amplitude is given by:

f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) Σ [ (2l + 1) e^{iδ_l} ( e^{i l θ} - 1 ) ]

Wait, or is it (e^{2iδ_l} - 1)? No, I think it's e^{iδ_l} ( e^{i l θ} - 1 ). Because each partial wave's contribution is weighted by e^{iδ_l}, and then multiplied by (e^{i l θ} - 1), which comes from the expansion.

But wait, the question is specifically about the imaginary part along the incident beam direction. Oh, the incident beam direction is when the scattering angle θ is zero degrees, right? Because the incident beam comes in, and the direction is along the beam, so θ=0.

So to find the imaginary part of f(0), I need to calculate Im(f(0)).

Let me plug θ=0 into the formula. So each term becomes:

(2l +1) e^{iδ_l} ( e^{i l * 0} - 1 ) = (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} (1 - 1) = 0.

Wait, that can't be right. Because all the terms would vanish, which would make f(0)=0. But that's not possible because the problem is asking for a non-zero value. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula is different. I think another version of the scattering amplitude is:

f(θ) = (1/k) Σ [ (2l +1) ( e^{i l θ} - 1 ) sin(δ_l) / ( e^{i l θ} + 1 ) ) ]

No, that doesn't ring a bell. Alternatively, maybe I should think
