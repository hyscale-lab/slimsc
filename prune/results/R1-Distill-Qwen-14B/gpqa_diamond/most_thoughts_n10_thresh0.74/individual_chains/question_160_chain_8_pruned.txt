Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about light diffraction through an aperture. Hmm, let me read it carefully.

The problem says the aperture is shaped like an N-sided polygon, and all the apothems are the same length 'a'. Monochromatic light with wavelength λ is shining along the z-axis, and we're looking at the far field region where intensity maxima and minima occur. The question is about the angular distance between the first two minima when N is infinitely large. Oh right, and we can approximate tanθ as θ because the angles are small.

Wait, I remember that when the number of sides N becomes infinitely large, the polygon turns into a circle. So the aperture becomes a circular one. But wait, the problem is about the minima, so I'm thinking about the diffraction pattern of a circular aperture.

In the case of a single-slit diffraction, the minima occur at certain angles given by a*sinθ = mλ, where m is the order of the minima (m=1,2,3...). But wait, that's for a single slit. But here, the shape is a polygon, and when N is infinite, it's a circle. So maybe I should think about the diffraction pattern of a circular aperture.

Oh wait, I think the circular aperture has a different pattern. The minima in the far field (Fraunhofer diffraction) for a circular aperture are given by the Bessel function zeros. The first minimum is at a certain angle, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula.

Wait, for a
