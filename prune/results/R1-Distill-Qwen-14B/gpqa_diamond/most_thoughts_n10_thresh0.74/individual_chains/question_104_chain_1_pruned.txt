Okay, so I've got this astronomy question about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step. Let me read the question carefully.

So the setup is that there are two stars with the same mass as each other, both similar to the Sun. Each has a planet with mass similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. The detection method used is the radial velocity (RV) method.

The RV method detects planets by measuring the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum as the planet's gravity causes the star to wobble. The shift is periodic and depends on the mass of the planet, the star's mass, and the orbital period and distance.

The question gives the shift in the spectral lines for each planet. Planet #1 causes a shift of up to 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2 causes a shift of 7 milliangstroms. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1.

Wait, wait. Orbital period relates to the Doppler shift. But how exactly? I remember that the RV method measures the velocity of the star towards and away from us. The semi-amplitude of this velocity (K) is related to the planet's mass and other factors.

The formula I recall is K = (v) = ( (G * (M_planet) ) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) ) )^(1/ something))... Wait, maybe I should think about the formula correctly. Oh right, the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ (G * (M_p)^3 sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) * (1 - e^2)^(1/2)) ) ]^(1/ something) — no, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's think of the simplified version since the planets have the same mass and the stars are same. Also, since the orbits are circular, e=0, so we don't have to worry about that.

Wait, the formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude is:

K = ( (G * P) / (2π) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * (1 + M_p/M_star) ) )

Wait, that's getting complicated. Alternatively, I think a more manageable form is:

K =
