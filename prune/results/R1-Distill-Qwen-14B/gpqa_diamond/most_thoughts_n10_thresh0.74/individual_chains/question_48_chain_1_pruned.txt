Okay, let's try to solve this problem step by step. So, the question involves a series of reactions starting with cyclohexanone and going through several transformations. I need to figure out how many chemically distinct hydrogen atoms are present in the final product, product 4.

First, I should probably draw out each step to visualize what's happening.

So, starting with cyclohexanone. I remember that cyclohexanone is a cyclic ketone. The structure is a six-membered cyclohexane ring with a ketone group (O) attached to one of the carbons. So, the carbonyl is at one position, and the rest are CH2 groups.

Step 1: Cyclohexanone is treated with bromine, forming product 1. Bromine (Br2) in what conditions? I think when ketones react with Br2, it's usually an addition reaction. Since ketones can undergo enolate formation, but wait, wait, no, for addition, we might be talking about something else. Alternatively, maybe it's a bromination via enolates. Oh wait, another possibility is that cyclohexanone undergoes a bromination via the enol mechanism, leading to the formation of a dibromide. Wait, no, maybe it's an addition across the carbonyl.

Wait, ketones can react with bromine in a way that adds Br across the carbonyl. Alternatively, but wait, I think in this case, the reaction is an example of the Hell–Volhard–Zelinskii reaction? No, that's for carboxylic acids. Alternatively, maybe it's an example of the benzoin condensation? No, that's for aldehydes. Hmm.

Wait, no, perhaps the bromine is adding to the carbonyl group. Let me think: when you add Br2 to a ketone, it's typically a dihalide addition. For example, cyclohexanone reacting with Br2 in a dihalo addition, giving 1,2-dibromo-1-cyclohexanol? No, wait, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps it's a bromonium ion formation, leading to a dibromide. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a bromide attacking the carbonyl, but that would require an acid catalyst. Wait, I'm a bit stuck.

Alternatively, maybe it's a bromination via the enol intermediate. Oh right, cyclohexanone can undergo enolate formation when treated with a base. But wait, in this case, we're using Br2, which is a dienophile maybe? No, perhaps it's a bromination at the alpha position. So, cyclohexanone has alpha carbons (the CH2 groups adjacent to the carbonyl). When treated with Br2, maybe in the presence of a base, it would undergo bromination at the alpha position.

Wait, another thought: perhaps bromine is adding to the carbonyl, but since the carbonyl is in a ring, maybe it's an intramolecular attack. Wait, no, perhaps it's more likely that the ketone undergoes a bromide addition to form a bromohydrin. No, wait, bromohydrin is when H2O and Br combine, but without water, perhaps it's a different scenario.

Wait, maybe the reaction is the addition of Br2 to the carbonyl group, making a 1,2-dibromocyclohexane derivative. Wait, cyclohexanone's structure is:

O
||
C-Ring

So adding Br2 would add across the carbonyl, so it would become OBr2? No, that can't be right because ketones don't typically react that way with Br2. Wait, perhaps it's a bromide ion addition. Wait, maybe the reaction is the formation of a bromide via some kind of substitution, but I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, another approach: perhaps it's a diels-alder reaction? No, that's for dienes and dienophiles. But cyclohexanone isn't a diene.

Wait, maybe I should think about the product. Product 1 is formed when cyclohexanone is treated with Br2. Let me think about the possible products. Oh! Maybe it's an epoxidation. Wait, no, epoxidation uses peracids, not Br2.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a bromine adding to the carbonyl group, leading to the formation of a bromide. Wait, maybe it's a cyclohexane ring with a bromine attached. Wait, but how? Oh, wait, perhaps the cyclohexanone is undergoing allylic bromination. Oh! Allylic bromination occurs when a ketone is present because the carbonyl is an electron-withdrawing group. So, allylic positions are activated for bromination.

So, in cyclohexanone, the carbonyl is at one position, and the adjacent carbons (alpha carbons) are CH2 groups. So, the alpha positions are next to the carbonyl. So, when treated with Br2, perhaps it undergoes allylic bromination, adding a bromine at the alpha position.

Wait, but how does that work? Allylic bromination typically uses a catalyst like NBS (N-bromosuccinimide) with light
