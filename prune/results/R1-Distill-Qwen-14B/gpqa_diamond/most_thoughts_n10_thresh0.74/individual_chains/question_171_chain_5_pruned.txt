Alright, so I've got this chemistry problem here about electrophilic substitution reactions with bromine. Hmm, okay. The question is asking me to arrange six substances based on the weight fraction of the para-isomer formed when they undergo this reaction. The options are A, B, C, D, each giving a different order.

Let me start by recalling what I know about electrophilic substitution reactions. These reactions typically involve a benzene ring reacting with an electrophile, where the substituents on the ring direct the incoming electrophile to certain positionsâ€”ortho, meta, or para relative to themselves. The directing effect depends on whether the substituent is activating or deactivating, and whether it's an electron-donating or withdrawing group.

So, each of the six compounds has a substituent attached to a benzene ring. Let's list them out again:

1) C6H5-CH3 (toluene)
2) C6H5-COOC2H5 (ethyl benzoate)
3) C6H5-Cl (chlorobenzene)
4) C6H5-NO2 (nitrobenzene)
5) C6H5-C2H5 (ethylbenzene)
6) C6H5-COOH (benzoic acid)

Wait, actually, I think I misread. Oh no, no, the first is toluene (methyl), second is ethyl benzoate (ester), third is chlorobenzene, fourth is nitrobenzene, fifth is ethylbenzene, sixth is benzoic acid.

In electrophilic substitution, the substituent's nature determines the reaction's direction. Activating groups (like -OCH3, -NH2, -CH3) are electron-donating, which make the ring more reactive and direct incoming electrophiles to ortho and para positions. Deactivating groups (like -NO2, -COOH, -Cl) are electron-withdrawing, making the ring less reactive and typically directing the electrophile to meta positions, except for some cases.

Wait, but wait. Chlorine is a bit tricky. Chlorine is an electron-withdrawing group (due to its electronegativity), but it's ortho/para-directing because the lone pairs on Cl can donate electrons through resonance, making the ortho and para positions more activated. So Cl is a meta director? No, wait. No, Cl is ortho/para-directing despite being deactivating. Because the inductive effect of Cl is electron-withdrawing (which deactivates the ring), but its resonance effect (donating electrons through lone pairs into the ring) is electron-donating. The inductive effect is stronger, so overall Cl is deactivating but still directs ortho/para.

Similarly, nitro groups are meta directors because they are strong deactivating (electron-withdrawing), so they don't allow electrophiles to come to ortho or para. They direct to meta.

Wait, but substituting in an electrophilic substitution, the Br+ is the electrophile here. So when excess Br2 is used under certain conditions, mono-bromination occurs. The position depends on the substituent.

Wait, but wait. The problem states that only one monobromo derivative is formed. Oh, but wait, that's not possible for some substituents. For example, nitro groups are meta directors, so the product would be predominantly meta-substituted. But for substituents that are ortho/para directors, like methyl, ethyl, Cl, the incoming Br could add to ortho, para, and maybe some meta. But in the case of a strong activating group, the para isomer may be more favored if the substituent is strongly activating and para is more accessible.

Wait, but the question is about the weight fraction of the para-isomer. So for each substituent, how much of the product is para.

So I need to determine, for each substituent, the percentage of para product formed.

Let me think about each compound:

1) C6H5-CH3 (toluene): methyl is an activating, ortho/para director. So when bromine adds, the major products are ortho and para. Since it's a meta director? No, methyl is activating, ortho/para. So the para would be one of the main products. But if the substituent is strongly activating, maybe the para isomer is a major component. For toluene, the para-bromination is a major product, but I think the ortho is actually more than para? Because for toluene, the ortho is more substituted due to steric hindrance? Wait, no, wait. Wait, when you have an activating group, the para is usually the major product because the ortho may have more steric hindrance. But wait, I think in toluene, the para isomer is the major product because the methyl group is in a position that allows the para bromine without too much steric hindrance. Hmm, perhaps the para is the major product. Or is that not the case?

Wait, I'm a bit
