Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The state of the system at time t is given by a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, wait, but in quantum mechanics, states are supposed to be normalized, right? So I should check that first. Let's calculate the norm of this vector. The components are -1, 2, 1. So the square of each component is 1, 4, 1. Adding them up gives 6. Oh, so the norm is sqrt(6). That means the state isn't normalized. Hmm, but operators are given as square matrices, which I think are P and Q. So I guess when we compute probabilities, we need to consider this normalization.

Wait, but maybe the state is already given as a column vector, perhaps normalized? Or perhaps notâ€”maybe I'm supposed to normalize it. Let me think. The state vector in quantum mechanics must have a magnitude (norm) of 1. So if our vector is (-1, 2, 1), its length is sqrt( (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 ) = sqrt(1+4+1)=sqrt(6). So the actual state would be (1/sqrt(6))*[ -1; 2; 1 ].

But the question says the state is a column matrix with elements (-1,2,1). So I think the state is unnormalized. So when we compute probabilities, we need to normalize everything.

The problem is about measuring P and then Q. Specifically, the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q. But wait, the way measurements work is that if we measure P first, the state collapses into an eigenstate of P. Then, when measuring Q, we consider the state after the collapse.

Wait, but to compute the probability, perhaps we can think of it as the product of the probabilities of each event given the previous measurement. So first, we find the probability that measuring P gives 0. Then, given that P was 0, the state is projected into the corresponding eigenvector, and then we find the probability
