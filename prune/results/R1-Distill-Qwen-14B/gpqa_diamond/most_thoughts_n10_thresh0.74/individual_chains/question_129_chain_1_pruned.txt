Okay, I need to figure out what compound E is in this reaction scheme. Let's take it step by step.

So, the reaction starts with Compound A. When A reacts with HCN, it forms B. Then, B is reduced with H2 and Pd to form C. Next, C reacts with HNO2 to make D, and finally, D loses an inert gas to become E.

The hints given might help. Hint a says that when A reacts with an unknown phosphorous ylide, it forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Hmm, I remember that phosphorous ylides are used in Wittig reactions. The Wittig reaction forms alkenes by reacting an aldehyde or ketone with the ylide. So, A must be a ketone or aldehyde because that's what the ylide reacts with.

Looking at the product from the Wittig reaction: 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. The propan-2-ylidene group is a substituent attached via a double bond. So, the structure of A must be such that when it undergoes this reaction, it forms that specific cyclopentane derivative.

Wait, the product after the Wittig is an alkene. So, A must be a ketone where the carbonyl is adjacent to a cyclopentane ring. Because the ylide would attack the carbonyl carbon and form the double bond.

So, if the product is 4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane with 1,2-dimethyl groups, then the starting ketone (A) would have a cyclopentane ring with substituents that, after losing the oxygen (from the carbonyl), form the specific structure.

Wait, perhaps I should draw this. Let's think: the cyclopentane ring has substituents at positions 1, 2, and 4. The 4 position has a propan-2-ylidene group, which is a CH2-C(CH3)= group attached as a substituent. The 1 and 2 positions are methyl groups.

So, when A is a ketone, perhaps it's a cyclopentanone derivative with substituents at certain positions. The Wittig would replace the carbonyl with a double bond.

Wait, let me think. The general Wittig reaction is R2C=O + ylide → R2C=CH2 (if ylide is CH2PH3+). But in this case, the ylide is producing a propan-2-ylidene group. Oh wait, the ylide would be more like (CH(CH2CH3))–PH3+ or something similar, but I'm not exactly sure. Alternatively, perhaps the ylide is a substituted one, so the product's substituent comes from the ylide.

Wait, perhaps the structure of A is 4-(propan-2-yl)cyclopentan-2-one. Because when the Wittig reaction occurs, the carbonyl group (O) would be replaced by a CH2 group connected via a double bond
