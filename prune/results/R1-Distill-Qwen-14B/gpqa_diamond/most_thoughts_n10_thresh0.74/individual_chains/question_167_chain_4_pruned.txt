Okay, so I've got this problem about calculating the non-Gaussianity of a Schrödinger cat state using relative entropy. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The state given is |psi> = [cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>]/N. N is the normalization constant, which is sqrt(1 + sin(2phi) * exp(-2alpha²)). The parameters are phi = -pi/4 and alpha = 0.5. I need to find the non-Gaussianity (nG) using the relative entropy measure del_b.

Wait, the relative entropy is defined as del_b = trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau), where rho is the density matrix of the non-Gaussian state and tau is the reference Gaussian state's density matrix.

So, non-Gaussianity here is measured by how different the state is from a Gaussian state, right? Because Gaussian states are easier to handle and are common in quantum optics.

First, I should probably find the density matrix rho for the given state. The state is a superposition of two coherent states |alpha> and |-alpha>, so it's a cat state, which is known to be non-Gaussian.

Density matrix rho for |psi> is |psi><psi|. So, expanding that, it'll be [cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>][cos(phi)<alpha| + sin(phi)<-alpha| ] divided by N².

Wait, but N is sqrt(1 + sin(2phi)*exp(-2alpha²)). So, N squared is 1 + sin(2phi)*exp(-2alpha²). Let me compute N first.

Given phi = -pi/4, so sin(2phi) is sin(-pi/2) which is -1. And alpha is 0.5, so exp(-2*(0.5)^2) = exp(-0.5) ≈ 0.6065. So, sin(2phi)*exp term is (-1)*0.6065 ≈ -0.6065. Then N² = 1 + (-0.6065) = 0.3935. So N is sqrt(0.3935) ≈ 0.6275.

But wait, since N is a normalization, the density matrix will have 1/N² as a factor. So, rho = (1/N²) [ cos^2(phi)|alpha><alpha| + sin^2(phi)|-alpha><-alpha| + cos(phi) sin(phi) (|alpha><-alpha| + |-alpha><alpha| ) ].

Hmm, but wait, the cross terms involve |alpha><-alpha| and vice versa. Those terms are not diagonal and might complicate things, but perhaps when considering the relative entropy, we'll need to compare with a Gaussian state.

Now, the reference state tau is a Gaussian state. For cat states, the reference Gaussian state is often the mixture of the two coherent states that make up the superposition. Because the density matrix of a Gaussian state in this context is a thermal state or a coherent state, but the cat state is a superposition of two coherent states, so the reference Gaussian might be a statistical mixture of |alpha> and |-alpha>, each with probability (cos²(phi) and sin²(phi)).

Wait, let's think. What's the most straightforward Gaussian state that could be the reference? The density matrix tau would probably be the same as the state if it were Gaussian. But the cat state is non-Gaussian because it's a superposition, not a statistical mixture. So the reference Gaussian tau is likely the closest Gaussian state to the non-Gaussian rho.

Alternatively, the reference Gaussian tau could be the density matrix that you get when you take the same state but without the quantum interference terms. So, for the cat state rho, it has cross terms which are non-Gaussian. The reference Gaussian tau would have the same diagonal terms (the populations) but zero off-diagonal terms (no coherences), making it a statistical mixture of |alpha> and |-alpha>.

Wait, but maybe the reference Gaussian is the state that has the same first and second moments as the cat state. Or perhaps it's the maximum-entropy Gaussian state with the same first and second moments.

Wait, for a cat state, the moments are those of a Gaussian state? No, because the cat state is non-Gaussian. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here.

Alternatively, the reference Gaussian tau could be the density matrix that you get when you take the same state but as a statistical mixture. Let me compute that.

Wait, another approach: for the relative entropy, you need to compute S(rho) - S(tau), where S is the von Neumann entropy. Because del_b is trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau), which is S(rho) - S(tau).

But wait, in the problem statement, del_b is defined as [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)].

Wait, the relative entropy typically is S(rho||tau) = trace(rho ln
