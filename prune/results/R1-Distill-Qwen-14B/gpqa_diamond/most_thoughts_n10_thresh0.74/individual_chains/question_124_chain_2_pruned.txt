Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, particles in a detector. Alright, so the setup is that particles are collided at the center of a spherical detector. They produce new particles that move at ultra-relativistic speeds with a Lorentz factor around 20 on average. Now, about one third of these particles reach the inner walls of the detector. The radius of the detector is 30 meters. The question is asking, what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of these particles reach the inner walls instead of one third.

Wait, so the original scenario is one third reaching, and the desired scenario is two-thirds. I need to find the required gamma (Lorentz factor) for that.

I remember that the Lorentz factor gamma is given by gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)). But maybe more importantly, the problem is about the time it takes for these particles to reach the detector walls. Since the particles are moving at relativistic speeds, time dilation and length contraction might come into play.

Wait, the particles are moving at ultra-relativistic speeds, so v is approximately c. But the exact gamma is given as ~20 in the original case. So let's think about the original scenario and the new scenario.

In the original case, with gamma = 20, one third of the particles reach the inner walls. So the problem is about how the number reaching depends on gamma.

Wait, but why does the number reaching the walls depend on gamma? Maybe because of the time it takes for the particles to reach the wall. If a particle's lifetime is longer (because of time dilation), it's more likely to reach the wall before decaying.

Oh wait, right! The particles are fast-decaying, which probably means they have a short mean lifetime. So if they have a longer proper lifetime (from our frame), but wait, no, wait. Wait, no: the particles' decay is in their own rest frame. So in our lab frame, their lifetime is longer by gamma. So if the lifetime is longer, they have a higher chance of traveling a longer distance before decaying.

So the particles' lifetime in the lab frame is tau = gamma * tau_0, where tau_0 is the proper lifetime (the lifetime measured in the particle's rest frame). So if gamma increases, tau increases, particles live longer, so more can reach the detector walls.

But in the original problem, with gamma ~20, one third reach the walls. So in the original case, the particles have a certain probability of reaching before decaying.

Wait, but wait, the problem states that on average, one third reach the inner walls. So maybe the probability is related to the ratio of the time it takes to reach the wall versus the particle's lifetime. So the probability P is the ratio of the time it takes to reach the wall divided by the lifetime (or something like that).

Let me model this. The particle has to travel a distance equal to the detector's radius, which is 30 meters. The time it takes is t = distance / speed. Since the particles are moving at speed v ≈ c, perhaps we can approximate t ≈ 30 m / c.

But wait, the speed isn't exactly c. Since gamma
