Okay, so I've got this NMR problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me first read the question carefully.

The question is about identifying an unknown organic compound based on its 1H NMR spectrum. The options are between different propenyl and butenyl acetates, either cis or trans. The NMR data given is:

1H NMR (ppm): 7.0 (1H, d, J=16.0 Hz), 5.5 (1H, dq), 2.1 (3H, s), 1.6 (3H, d).

Hmm, I'll need to break this down. So, first, let me think about the structure of these compounds. Acetate esters have the structure R-O-CO-O-R', but wait, no, wait: acetate is the ester where the acid is acetic acid. So it's R-O-CO-OCH3? Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, acetate is OAc is O-CO-OCH3. So the ester would be something like CH3COO-R, where R is the propenyl or butenyl group.

Wait, the options are propenyl and butenyl acetates. Let me clarify the structures.

Propenyl groups are three-carbon, like CH2=CHCH2- or similar. Wait, propenyl could be CH2CH2CH2, but with a double bond. So propenyl group would be CH2=CHCH2- or CH2CH2CH2 with a double bond elsewhere. Wait, but wait, propenyl is CH2CHCH2, but where's the double bond? For propene, the structure is CH2=CH2CH3, but when it's an ester, the propenyl group is attached to the oxygen. So for propenyl acetate, it's CH3CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH2? No, wait, no: propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-O- ?

Wait, no, propenyl would be CH2CHCH2, but the actual structure depends on where the double bond is. For propenyl groups, the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2: CH2=CHCH2-.

Wait, but then when it's an ester, the structure would be CH3COO-CH2-CH=CH2, but wait, that's butenyl. Wait, no, propenyl is three carbons with a double bond. So maybe it's CH2=CHCH2-O-Ac.

Wait, but wait: the options given are propenyl and butenyl. Let me clarify:

- Propenyl group: CH2=CHCH2-

- Butenyl group: CH2=CHCH2CH2- but wait, but depending on the position of the double bond.

Wait, but the esters would be:

- Cis-propenyl acetate: the double bond in the propenyl group would have the substituents on the same side, but wait, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-OAc. So if the double bond is between C1 and C2, then the structure is CH2=CHCH2-O
