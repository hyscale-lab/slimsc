Alright, so I've got this question about the Michael addition reaction. Hmm, I remember that Michael addition involves enolates attacking a conjugated carbonyl compound. Let me think about each part step by step.

The question has three parts: A, B, and C. I need to determine the products for each. Let's take them one by one.

Starting with part A: The reactants are dimethyl malonate and methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, with NaOEt and EtOH as the base. I think NaOEt is a strong base, so it'll deprotonate the malonate to form an enolate. Dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile because the enolate is stabilized by the two ester groups.

The other reactant is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. The structure would be CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OEt. Wait, no, the structure is more like CH2=CH-C-OEt, but with the p-tolyl group on the central carbon. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me draw it out mentally: the acrylate is (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, so the double bond is between carbons 2 and 3, with the p-tolyl group on carbon 3. So the structure is CH2-C(p-tolyl)=CH-OEt? No, wait, the formula is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. So the double bond is between C2 and C3. So the structure is CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OEt, but in E configuration. Wait, actually, the correct structure would be CH2-CH2-C-OEt with substituents on C3? Hmm, maybe I should think in terms of the Michael acceptor and donor.

In a Michael addition, the enolate (nucleophile) attacks the α,β-unsaturated carbonyl (acceptor). So the dimethyl malonate enolate is the nucleophile, and the methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is the acceptor.

When the enolate attacks, it'll add to the β position of the acceptor. So the acceptor is CH2-C(p-tolyl)=CH-OEt. Wait,
