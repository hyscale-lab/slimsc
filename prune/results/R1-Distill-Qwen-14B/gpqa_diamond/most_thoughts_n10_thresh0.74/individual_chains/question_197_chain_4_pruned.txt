Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these types of questions. But I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question is about identifying the final product when Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. The given data includes IR and 1H NMR spectra. Let's start by analyzing these spectral data to figure out what Compound X is.

First, looking at the IR data: the peaks are at 3400–2500 cm-1, which usually indicates O-H or N-H stretches. Wait, or maybe it's an alkyne C-H stretch? But the region is broad. Alternatively, the 3400–2500 could be due to an O-H group like a carboxylic acid or an alcohol. But the 1720 cm-1 peak is strong. That's a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Carboxylic acids have O-H stretches around 2500-3300 (usually broad), and their carbonyls are around 1700 cm-1. But wait, the IR here also has 1610 and 1450 peaks. Those might be from aromatic rings—maybe C=C stretching. So, the compound likely has an aromatic ring and a carbonyl group.

Looking at the NMR data. Let's see:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): A broad singlet around 10 ppm usually suggests an aldehyde proton, but wait, aldehydes are usually around 9-10. But wait, another possibility is a carboxylic acid, which has a broad peak due to hydrogen bonding. But wait, the integration is 1H—so maybe it's an aldehyde? Or perhaps an acidic proton like from a phenol, but more likely a carboxylic acid or aldehyde. Wait, but in the NMR data the next is at 8.0 ppm (d, 2H), which is typical for aromatic protons. So maybe it's a para-substituted benzene ring.

The 8.0 ppm doublet (2H) and 7.2 ppm doublet (2H) suggest a para-substituted aromatic ring. So perhaps there's a substituent at the para position, making a symmetrical structure. So maybe the substituent is in the para position, giving two doublets each integrating to 2H.

Looking at the other peaks in the NMR:

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): This is a multiplet integrating to 1H. Maybe a CH group adjacent to something else, perhaps a carbonyl. Like if there's a ketone or an ester, but wait, the IR has a carbonyl. Alternatively, it could be an CH adjacent to an oxygen, like in an ether or ester.

- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): Two protons as a multiplet. Could this be a CH2 group next to something, maybe a carbonyl or an aromatic ring?

- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): A triplet as a doublet? Wait, no, it's a doublet, 3H. That's likely a CH3 group attached to something that's next to another CH group. So maybe a CH(CH3) group. Like in an isopropyl or something.

- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): A triplet integrating to 3H. This suggests a CH2CH3 group,
