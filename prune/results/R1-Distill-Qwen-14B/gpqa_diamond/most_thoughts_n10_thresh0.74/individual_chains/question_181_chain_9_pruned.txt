Okay, so I've got this question about neutrinos from the Sun, and I need to figure out the ratio of the flux between two energy bands. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the question says that the pp-III branch in the Sun's core stopped 8.5 minutes ago. Hmm, I remember that the pp-III reactions are part of the proton-proton chain, which is the main way the Sun produces energy. Oh wait, the proton-proton chain has a couple of branches, right? Like pp-I, pp-II, and pp-III. The pp-III branch is the dominant one, producing about 86% of the Sun's energy through the fusion of protons into helium.

So if the pp-III branch suddenly stops, what happens? Well, the Sun's core reactions would be affected. The pp-III process produces a lot of high-energy neutrinos, especially electron neutrinos. Oh, right, because in the pp-III branch, a boron-8 nucleus (which is a product of the earlier steps) undergoes inverse beta decay, emitting a neutrino. So if pp-III stops, that source of neutrinos is gone.

But wait, the question says all other reactions remain as they were. So other neutrino-producing processes must continue. Oh, like the other branches of the pp chain, or perhaps the CNO cycle? The CNO cycle is another hydrogen fusion process, but I think it's more dominant in higher mass stars than the Sun. Wait, no, the Sun actually uses both the proton-proton chain and the CNO cycle, but the proton-proton chain is dominant, especially in the core where temperatures are lower. The CNO cycle contributes about 16% of the Sun's energy. But neutrinos from the CNO cycle? I'm not too sure about that. I think both the proton-proton and CNO cycles produce neutrinos, but mainly the proton-proton does so via the pp-III branch.

Wait, but the problem says that the pp-III branch stops. So other branches, like pp-I and pp-II, are still happening, but they produce fewer neutrinos? Because I think the main neutrino emission comes from the boron-8 decay in the pp-III branch. So if that stops, the flux of neutrinos from that source would drop significantly.

But wait, neutrinos are produced in other layers of the Sun too. For example, in the outer regions, there
