Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this electron microscopy question. Let me start by breaking down the problem. 

So, Mike is working on a high-resolution transmission electron microscope. He's using a very high accelerating voltage, 1000 kV. He connected vacuum pumps to create an ultra-high vacuum in the sample compartment, which is less than 10^-9 Torr. The idea is to get rid of as many gas molecules as possible because, in electron microscopy, having a lot of gas can cause problems like scattering of electrons, reducing image quality.

But even with all that pumping, some gas particles are still there. The mass spectrometer detected them. Mike calculated the mean free path of these gas molecules as λ1. Mean free path is the average distance a molecule travels between collisions, right? It depends on factors like pressure, temperature, and the size of the compartment.

Now, when Mike starts the electron beam, he notices something interesting. The mean free path changes from λ1 to λ2. But the temperature in the compartment is the same, so that factor shouldn't change. So why would λ change?

Wait, the mean free path formula might help here. The mean free path λ is given by λ = 1/(n * π * d² / 2), where n is the number density of the gas molecules, and d is the effective diameter of the molecules. Alternatively, sometimes it's written as λ = (k*T)/(sqrt(2)*π*d²*P), where k is Boltzmann's constant, T is temperature, and P is pressure.

But wait, another formula I remember is the mean free path in terms of pressure. The formula is λ = (k*T)/(sqrt(2)*π*d²*P), but I'm not sure about the exact constants. Alternatively, sometimes it's expressed as λ ≈ 0.618 * (k*T)^(3/2)/(π * d^2 * P^(1/2)) ), but I might be mixing things up.

Wait, perhaps another approach. In the mean free path equation, λ is inversely proportional to the pressure and the square of the molecular diameter, and directly proportional to the temperature. Since the temperature remains the same, any change in λ must be due to a change in pressure or the number of molecules.

But in this scenario, when the electron beam is turned on, does the pressure change? Well,
