Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it. Let me read it again.

The problem says there are two electrons in p orbital angular momentum states. We're ignoring their spin angular momentum. The coupled angular momentum state is given as |l₁, l₂, l, m> = |1,1,2,-1>. So each electron has orbital angular momentum quantum numbers l₁=1 and l₂=1. The total angular momentum quantum numbers are l=2 and m=-1.

The question is asking about the joint probability of measuring both L₁z and L₂z (the z-components of each electron's orbital angular momentum) and getting eigenvalues of -ħ each.

Hmm, right. So each L_z eigenvalue for an electron in a p orbital would be mħ, where m can be -1, 0, or +1. Since l=1, m can be -1, 0, 1. So for each electron, L₁z and L₂z can each have values of -ħ, 0, or ħ.

Wait, the measurement we're asked about is getting both L₁z and L₂z equal to -ħ. So for each electron, that would mean m₁ = -1 and m₂ = -1. So the combined m would be m₁ + m₂ = -2, but wait in the state given, the total m is -1. Oh, wait, that's the total m for the combined state.

Wait a second, the total state is |1,1,2,-1>. So the total m is -1. But if each electron has m=-1, then the sum would be -2, not -1. Hmm, that's a problem. So the combined state of m=-2 is not the same as the given state which has m=-1. So is it possible for both electrons to have m=-1 in this state?

Wait, maybe I should think about the coupling of angular momenta. Each electron has l=1, so when you couple two l=1's, the possible total l values are 2, 1, 0. And for each l, the m can range from -l to +l in integer steps.

The given state is |1,1,2,-1>. So the total angular momentum is l=2, m=-1. To find the probability of each individual electron having m=-1, we need to see how the state |1,1,2,-1> can be expressed in terms of the product states |m₁, m₂>, where m₁ and m₂ are the individual m values of each electron.

Wait, the coupled state is expressed in terms of the total angular momentum. So it's a combination of product states where m₁ + m₂ = total m. But in this case, total m is -1.

So each product state in the expansion must have m₁ + m₂ = -1. So possible combinations are:

m₁ = -1, m₂=0
m₁ = 0, m₂=-1
m₁ = 1, m₂=-2 (but wait, m can't be -2 for l=1; m₂ can only be -1, 0, +1. So m₂=-2 isn't allowed.)

Wait, so the possible product states are m₁ = -1, m₂=0; m₁=0, m₂=-1; m₁=1, m₂=-2 (invalid), etc. Wait, no, because m₂ can't be less than -1. So the only possible product states are m₁=-1, m₂=0 and m₁=0, m₂=-1.

So in the coupled state |l=2, m=-1>, the state is a linear combination of these product states: |m₁=-1, m₂=0> and |m₁=0, m₂=-1>.

Wait, but how does the state |l=2, m=-1> look in terms of these product states? I remember that for coupled angular momenta, you can express the total state in terms of the product states.
