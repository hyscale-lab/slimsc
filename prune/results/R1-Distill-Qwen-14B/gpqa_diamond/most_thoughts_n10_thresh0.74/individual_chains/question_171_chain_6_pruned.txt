Okay, so I've got this question about electrophilic substitution reactions with bromine. Hmm, I remember that bromine usually acts as an electrophile in such reactions, adding to the aromatic ring. The question is about the para-isomer yield, and I need to arrange the substances 1-6 in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer. That means from the lowest para yield to the highest.

Wait, the para weight fraction being low or high depends on the directing groups present on the benzene ring. Right, substituents on benzene can be activating or deactivating, and they direct incoming electrophiles to specific positions—ortho, meta, or para.

So let me list each substance and their substituents:

1) C6H5-CH3: The substituent is methyl (CH3). Methyl is an activating, ortho/para-directing group. So bromine will add mainly to ortho and para positions.

2) C6H5-COOC2H5: The substituent is ethyl ester of a carboxylic acid, COOEt. The carboxylic ester group is a deactivating, meta-directing group because the carbonyl is electron-withdrawing.

3) C6H5-Cl: Substituent is Cl. Chlorine is a deactivating (due to its electronegativity) but ortho/para-directing group. Because it's deactivating, it slows down the reaction, but directs para and ortho.

4) C6H5-NO2: Nitro group is a strong deactivating, meta-directing group. So incoming electrophiles go to meta positions more than para and ortho.

5) C6H5-C2H5: Substituent is ethyl group (C2H5). Similar to methyl, it's an activating, ortho/para-directing group.

6) C6H5-COOH: Substituent is carboxylic acid (COOH). The COOH group is deactivating (because of the electron-withdrawing -COOH group) and meta-directing.

Wait, but wait—what about the substituent's effect on the reaction rate and the regiochemistry? For the para fraction, the substituent's ability to direct to para and the activation effect matter.

But wait the question is about the weight fraction of the para-isomer. So for each substituent, how much para product is formed?

So let's think about each substituent:

1) Methyl (CH3): Ortho/para-directing, activating. So in bromination, the major products are ortho and para. But for para, it's a big fraction. But when there are multiple positions, the para is a significant part. However, if a substituent strongly activates, does that change the ratio? Not exactly; it just makes the reaction faster but doesn't change the ratio much.

2) COOEt: Deactivating, meta-directing. So the main product is meta, so para would be minor.

3) Cl: Deactivating, ortho/para. So para is a possible product, but since Cl is deactivating, the overall para product is less than if it were activating. Wait, but Cl is ortho/para but deactivating. So the ring is less reactive, but the incoming electrophile will go to ortho and para. So compared to a deactivating group that directs meta, the para fraction would be higher in Cl than COOEt or NO2.

4) NO2: Strongly deactivating, meta-directing. So para is not a major product. So the para fraction is low.

5) C2H5: Like methyl, activating, ortho/para. So para is a major product.

6) COOH: Deactivating, meta-directing. So similar to 2, the para product is not major.

Now, I need to arrange them from the lowest to highest in terms of para fraction.

Let's list each substituent's para yield.

Substance 4: NO2 — meta director. So para is least. So para fraction is low.

Substance 2: COOEt — meta director. So para is low but a little more than NO2? Hmm, not sure. Wait, meta directors would lead to less para product. So between 2 and 4, 4 (NO2) would have less para than 2 (COOEt). Because NO2 is stronger deactivating but same meta direction. Or wait, actually, the directing effect is more about where substitution occurs. So with a meta director, the para is not a major product. So perhaps for substituents that are meta directors, the para product is minimal. So substances 2,4,6 are meta directors, so their para yields are low.

Substances 1,3,5 are ortho/para directors.

Wait, but wait, wait. The substituent 3 is Cl, which is deactivating but ortho/para. So it's a weaker activating group than the methyl or ethyl.

So for substituents 1,3,5, the para product is formed. The substituents 2,4,6, the para product is not formed much.

Wait, but for substituents that are meta directors, the para isn't a major product. So the para fraction is low. So substances 2,4,6 would have lower para yields than 1,3,5.

So the order of para fraction from low to high would be:

Lowest: 4 (NO2, meta) → 2 (COOEt, meta) →6 (COOH, meta) → then 3 (Cl, ortho/para but deactivating) → 1 (CH3, ortho/para, activating) →5 (C2H5, ortho/para, activating).

Wait, but wait, Cl is deactivating. So even though it's an ortho/para director, the overall para product may be less than for activating groups. So in a reaction with Cl, since the ring is less reactive, the para product is maybe not as high as for methyl or ethyl.

So, substituents:

Subst 4: NO2 → meta → para is minimal.

Subst 2: COOEt → meta → para is minimal, but perhaps more than 4? Or less? Hmm, both are meta directors, so their para fractions are low.

Wait, perhaps the para fraction is actually zero for meta directors because they don't direct to para. So in that case, substituents 2,4,6 would have minimal or zero para products. Wait, but that can't be right because sometimes, depending on other factors, some para product might form, but it's much less than ortho and meta.

Wait, but the question says that only one monobromo
