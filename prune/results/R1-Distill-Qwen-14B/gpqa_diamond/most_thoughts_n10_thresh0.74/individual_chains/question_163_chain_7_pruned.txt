Okay, so I have this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think through it step by step. The question is about dissolving Fe(OH)3 in a strong acid and finding the minimum volume of the acid needed, as well as the pH of the resulting solution. Hmm, let's break it down.

First, I remember that Fe(OH)3 is a metal hydroxide, which is a base. So when it reacts with a strong acid, they'll neutralize each other. The acid here is monobasic and strong, which probably means it's something like HCl since monobasic acids donate one proton, like HCl, HNO3, etc.

The problem says we have 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3 to dissolve in 100 cm³ of solution. I think I need to find out how much acid is required to completely dissolve this Fe(OH)3. 

So, step one is to find the molar mass of Fe(OH)3. Let me calculate that. Iron (Fe) has an atomic mass of about 55.85 g/mol. Oxygen (O) is 16, and Hydrogen (H) is 1. So for Fe(OH)3: Fe is 55.85, each OH is 17 (16 +1), and there are three OH groups. So 55.85 + 3*(17) = 55.85 + 51 = 106.85 g/mol. 

Next, I'll calculate the number of moles of Fe(OH)3. Moles = mass / molar mass. So 0.1 grams divided by 106.85 g/mol. Let me compute that: 0.1 / 106.85 ≈ 0.000936 moles or 9.36e-4 mol.

Now, the reaction between Fe(OH)3 and a strong acid. Since it's a hydroxide reacting with an acid, the general reaction is:
Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ → Fe^3+ + 3H2O.

Wait, but wait. Fe(OH)3 is a weak base and may not dissolve easily, but with a strong acid, the reaction should go to completion. So each mole of Fe(OH)3 will react with 3 moles of H+ ions.

So, the moles of H+ needed would be 3 times the moles of Fe(OH)3. So 3 * 0.000936 ≈ 0.002808 mol of H+.

The acid is 0.1 M, which is 0.1 mol per liter. Since we're dealing with volume in cm³, which is liters (1 cm³ = 0.001 L), I can calculate the volume needed. 

Molarity (M) = moles / volume in liters. Rearranging, volume = moles / M. 

So, volume of acid needed is 0.002808 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.02808 L, which is 28.08 cm³. 

Wait, but that's the minimum volume to provide enough H+ to react with Fe(OH)3. But wait, the total solution volume after adding the acid is 100 cm³ (as given), so does that mean the acid volume plus the solution volume is 100 cm³? Or is the 100 cm³ the final solution volume?

Wait, the question says: "dissolve... in 100 cm³ total volume." So when we add the acid, the total volume becomes 100 cm³. Hmm, so the volume of the acid (V_acid) plus the volume of the solution before adding acid (which I think is 100 cm³ minus V_acid) would make the total 100 cm³.

Wait, no, perhaps the 100 cm³ is the final volume, so when you add the acid, the total becomes 100 cm³. So the volume of acid is just the amount needed to react, but the solution is made up to 100 cm³. Hmm, but that might not affect the calculation for the moles of H+ needed, because the moles required depend only on the stoichiometry, not the total volume. So regardless of the total volume, the moles of H+ needed are 3 times the moles of Fe(OH)3.

So I think the minimum acid volume is 28.08 cm³. Looking at the options, option C is 28.05 cm³. Close enough, considering rounding.

Now, the second part is finding the pH of the resulting solution. After the reaction, what's in the solution?

The reaction is Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ → Fe^3+ + 3H2O.

So each mole of Fe(OH)3 produces one mole of Fe^3+ ions. The moles of Fe^3+ are 0.000936 mol.

The solution's volume is 100 cm³, so concentration of Fe^3+ is 0.000936 mol / 0.1 L = 0.00936 M, which is 9.36e-3 M.

Wait, but Fe^3+ is a weak acid because it can hydrolyze in water. So it will undergo hydrolysis:

Fe^3+ + 3H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3 + 3H+.

So, the concentration of H+ ions in the solution will come from this hydrolysis. But wait, the initial solution has Fe^3+ and H+ from the excess acid? Or is all the H+ from the acid consumed in the reaction?

Wait, in the reaction, all the H+ will react with the Fe(OH)3. Wait, no. Because the stoichiometric amount of H+ is needed. So in this case, the moles of H+ added are exactly 3 times that of Fe(OH)3, so all the H+ is used up, and
