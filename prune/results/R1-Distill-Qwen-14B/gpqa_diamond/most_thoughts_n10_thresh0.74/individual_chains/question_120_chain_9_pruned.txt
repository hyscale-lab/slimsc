Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, let me try to break it down. The question says that stars are uniformly distributed, and we need to find out how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. The options are various power laws, like 1 over plx to some exponent.

Wait, parallax is related to distance, right? Oh yeah, parallax plx is inversely proportional to distance. Like, plx (in arcseconds) is 1 divided by the distance in parsecs. So a larger parallax means a closer star.

But wait, the distribution is uniform in the sky. So the question is about the number of stars per unit parallax. I think it's about how the density of stars changes with parallax. So when you look at a certain range of parallax, how many stars are in that range?

I remember that the number density of stars isn't just a simple function, but I think it depends on the volume. Since parallax relates to distance, and volume depends on distance cubed, maybe that comes into play.

Let me think about the relationship between parallax and distance. Parallax plx = 1/d, where d is distance in parsecs. So if plx increases, d decreases. So the number of stars with a certain parallax range would depend on how many stars are at those distances.

But stars are uniformly distributed, so their number density might be uniform in space. Wait, no. If they're uniformly distributed in the sky, does that mean their density is uniform in space or just that their
