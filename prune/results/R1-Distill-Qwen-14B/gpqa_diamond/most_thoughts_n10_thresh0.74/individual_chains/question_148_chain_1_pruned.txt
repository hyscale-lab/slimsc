Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question is about binary compounds of fluorine with another element Y. There are five such compounds. I'm supposed to find the molecular weight range of substance A4 based on the reactions described.

Let's start by going through each part of the problem.

First, substance A1 is a bright-red substance that decomposes at 293 K (which is room temperature, about 25°C) into A2 and fluorine. The oF for A2 is 31.96%, which I think refers to the mass percent of fluorine in A2. So, A1 decomposes into A2 and F2 gas.

Wait, oF probably stands for oxygen-free? Or maybe it's the oxidation state of fluorine? Hmm, no, I think it's more likely the mass percent of fluorine. Because 31.96% sounds familiar. Fluorine has an atomic weight of about 19, so let me check: 19/(19 + something) = 0.3196. Let me calculate that.

19 / (19 + x) = 0.3196 → 19 = 0.3196*(19 + x) → 19 = 6.0724 + 0.3196x → 19-6.0724=0.3196x → 12.9276/0.3196 ≈ 40.5. So x is about 40.5. That's close to the atomic weight of calcium, which is around 40, but wait, no, because if A2 is a binary compound of Y and F, Y would be the other element.

Wait, but let's think about known fluorine compounds. If A1 is bright red and decomposes into A2 and F2, I'm thinking that maybe A1 is something like ClF3 or BrF3? Or perhaps it's something else. Wait, but I'm not sure yet. Let me think again.

Also, A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions. Xenon is a noble gas, so it's usually unreactive, but some fluorine compounds can be strong oxidizing agents. For example, ClF3 is a strong oxidizing agent, but can it oxidize xenon? Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps A1 is a higher fluoride, like YF5? Or maybe YF6? Wait, I'm not sure.

Wait, another clue: A3 can also interact with xenon. A3 is obtained by fluorinating element Y with fluorine. So A3 is probably YF, or YF2, or something like that. The fluorination of Y probably starts with YF or perhaps YF2, but wait, if Y is a metal, it's more likely to form a higher fluoride.

Wait, but let's think about the decomposition of A1 into A2 and F2. So A1 → A2 + F2. Let's say A1 is YF3 and A2 is YF2. Then the decomposition would be YF3 → YF2 + F2. But wait, let me check the fluorine percentages. If A2 is YF2, and the fluorine mass percent is 31.96%, then YF2's fluorine is 31.96%. So YF2's formula would be YF2. Let me compute the molar mass of YF2.

Fluorine is 19 g/mol. So 2*19 = 38. The total mass is Y + 38. The mass percent of F is (38)/(Y +38) * 100 = 31.96%.

So 38/(Y+38) = 0.3196 → 38 = 0.3196*(Y+38) → 38/0.3196 ≈ Y +38 → 118.8 ≈ Y +38 → Y ≈ 80.8. What element has an atomic weight around 80? That's around strontium (Sr is about 87.6), or maybe yttrium (Y is about 88.9). Wait, but the problem refers to element Y, so Y could be that element. Hmm, but maybe another approach.

Wait, perhaps A1 is YF5, which decomposes into YF3 and F2. Let me see: YF5 → YF3 + F2.

In YF3, the fluorine content would be (3*19)/(Y + 3*19) *100. Let me compute that with Y around 88 (like yttrium).

3*19 =57. Y is 88.9. So 57/(88.9+57) =57/(1
