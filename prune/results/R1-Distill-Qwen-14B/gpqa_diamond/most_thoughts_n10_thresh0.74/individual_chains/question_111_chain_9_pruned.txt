Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reaction mechanisms. But let's take it step by step. The question has two parts, A and B, and I need to figure out each to choose the correct option.

Starting with part A: The reactant is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. The reagent is ethyl acrylate with t-BuOK. Hmm, I remember that when you have a ketone reacting with something like an acrylate, it's probably a Michael addition or maybe an aldol reaction. Wait, but wait—t-BuOK is a strong base, right? So maybe it's a Michael addition, which is a conjugate addition.

So, Michael addition involves a nucleophile attacking the beta position of an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl. In this case, ethyl acrylate is the Michael donor. Let me think about the structure of 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. The cyclohexanone ring has substituents at positions 2 (ethyl and methyl) and 6 (methyl). So the ketone is at position 1, and the ring has substituents at 2 and 6.

When ethyl acrylate, which is an enoate ester, reacts with a ketone, it's a conjugate addition. The enolate would form from the ketone, and then attack the alpha, beta-unsaturated ester. Wait no, wait. Wait, the enolate is the nucleophile. So the base t-BuOK deprotonates the ketone to form an enolate. Then, the enolate attacks the alpha position of the ethyl acrylate.

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, since the acrylate is the alpha-beta unsaturated ester, it's the Michael acceptor. So the enolate from the cyclohexanone would attack the beta carbon of the acrylate.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me picture the structures. The cyclohexanone is 1-oxo, with substituents at 2 and 6. So the ring is substituted at positions 2 (ethyl and methyl) and 6 (methyl). So 2 has two substituents—ethyl and methyl—so it's a bit bulky there.

When the enolate forms, the alpha carbons are at positions adjacent to the carbonyl. So, for cyclohexanone, the alpha carbons are adjacent to the carbonyl group (position 1). So in 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one, the enolate would form at either position 2 (but that's already substituted with ethyl and methyl) or maybe position 6, which has a methyl. Wait, but the enolate forms where the hydrogen is most acidic, which is typically the less substituted position because of better stabilization.

Wait, but in this case, the alpha positions are positions 2 and 6 relative to the carbonyl. Wait, no, wait—the carbonyl is at position 1.
