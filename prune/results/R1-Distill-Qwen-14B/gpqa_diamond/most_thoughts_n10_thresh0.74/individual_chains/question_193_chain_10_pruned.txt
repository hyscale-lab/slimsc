Okay, so I have this question about astronomy and I'm a bit confused, but let's try to think it through step by step. The question says that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. So, the number of stars N is proportional to 1/plx^5. I remember that parallax is related to distance, so I need to connect parallax with distance.

Wait, what's parallax again? Parallax is the apparent shift in the position of a star as seen from Earth due to our orbit around the Sun. The formula I remember is that parallax (plx) in parsecs is inversely proportional to the distance (d) in parsecs. So, plx = 1/d. That makes sense because the closer a star is, the larger its parallax.

So if plx = 1/d, then d = 1/plx. Now, the question says N ‚àù 1/plx^5. Substituting d into that, since 1/plx is d, then 1/plx^5 would be d^5. So N is proportional to d^5.

But wait, the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance. Hmm, so I think this is about the number of stars in a shell between radius r and r+dr. So the number of stars in a thin shell would be the number density multiplied by the volume of the shell.

Wait, let me clarify. If the number of stars is proportional to d^5, then for small changes in d, the number of stars per unit
