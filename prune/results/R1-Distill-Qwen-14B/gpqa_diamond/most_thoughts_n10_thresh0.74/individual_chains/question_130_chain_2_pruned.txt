Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this astronomy question. Let me read it again. The question is about large clouds of neutral hydrogen in deep space absorbing light from background quasars at the Lyman alpha wavelength, which is about 1216 Angstroms. We need to estimate the lower limit on the redshift of these objects so that they can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes.

Hmm, I remember that the Lyman alpha emission line is in the ultraviolet part of the spectrum for hydrogen. So when these clouds absorb at that wavelength, it causes the quasar's light to be absorbed at that specific wavelength. But wait, when the light comes from a distant object, the expansion of the universe causes redshift. So the observed wavelength would be longer than the emitted one.

Ground-based optical telescopes can't detect wavelengths beyond the Earth's atmosphere, which blocks a lot of UV light. I think the cutoff is around 300 nm because the atmosphere is opaque to much of the UV. So, if the observed wavelength of the Lyman alpha absorption is in the optical range (which is what the telescope can see), then it must have been redshifted into the optical.

The Lyman alpha wavelength is 1216 Angstroms, which is 121.6 nm. But wait, that's in the UV. So if the quasar's light is at 1216 Angstroms and it gets redshifted, the observed wavelength λ_obs would be z+1 times longer. So λ_obs = λ_emit * (1 + z).

We want λ_obs to be less than or equal to about 300 nm (since optical goes up to around there). Let me double-check the optical range. I think optical is roughly 400 nm (violet) to about 700 nm (red). But considering what the atmosphere allows through, it's about 300 nm and above. So for the cloud to be detected, the Lyman alpha absorption must be in the observed optical range, which starts around 300 nm.

Wait, but wait. The Lyman alpha is emitted at 1216 Angstroms (121.6 nm), so for it to appear in the optical, it must be redshifted by a factor that brings it into the visible range. Let's calculate the required redshift.

So, λ_obs = 1216 A * (1 + z) = 1216 * (1 + z) Angstroms.

We want λ_obs to be in the optical range, which I'm thinking is about 400 nm (4000 A) and above. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 1 Angstrom is 0.1 nm. So 1216 Angstroms = 121.6 nm, which is in the UV. So if the observed wavelength is, say, 400 nm (which is violet, part of optical), then (1 + z) would be 4000 / 1216 ≈ 3.29. So z ≈ 2.29. But wait, the question is about the lower limit. So the minimal redshift where Lyman alpha is just entering the optical.

Wait, but the atmosphere's cutoff is about 300 nm. So if the observed wavelength is at least 300 nm, then it's in the optical. So let me compute when λ_obs is 300 nm, which is 3000 Angstroms.

So 3000 A = 1216 A * (1 + z)
(1 + z) = 3000 / 1216 ≈ 2.466
z ≈ 1.466. So z ≈ 1.47.

Wait, but that would make the observed wavelength 300 nm, which is the start of what's observable. So the clouds at z=1.47 would have Lyman alpha absorption at 300 nm, which is the lower end of optical.

But wait, ground-based optical telescopes typically don't go below about 3
