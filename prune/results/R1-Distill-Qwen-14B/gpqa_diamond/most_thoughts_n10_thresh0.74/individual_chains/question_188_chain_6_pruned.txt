Okay, so I have this question about crystallography. Hmm, I remember that interplanar distances are calculated using some formula involving the lattice parameters and the Miller indices of the plane. Wait, the crystal is rhombohedral, right? I think rhombohedral has all sides equal and all angles equal, so it's a special case of a hexagonal or cubic crystal? No, wait, rhombohedral is a type of Bravais lattice where all a, b, c are equal, and all angles alpha, beta, gamma are equal. So it's like a cube that's been skewed equally in all directions.

The question gives the interatomic distance as 10 Angstrom, but wait, interatomic distance in a crystal is the distance between adjacent atoms along the lattice. In a simple cubic structure, that's just the lattice parameter a. But in a rhombohedral structure, which is a type of cubic system but with all angles equal and less than 90 degrees. Wait no, rhombohedral is a separate system where a = b = c, and the angles are all equal but not 90 degrees. So the interatomic distance in this case would be equal to the lattice parameter a, which is 10 Angstrom here.

The problem is to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. The formula for interplanar distance d in a crystal is given by the reciprocal formula: d = a / sqrt( (h^2)/(a^2) + (k^2)/(b^2) + (l^2)/(c^2) + ... some terms involving the angles. Wait, no, I think the formula is more complex because in a rhombohedral lattice, the lattice is not orthogonal, so the interplanar distance formula includes the angles between the lattice vectors.

Wait, the general formula for interplanar distance for a plane (hkl) is d = 1 / sqrt( (h²/l²) + (k²/m²) + (l²/n²) - (hk cos α)/(lm a²) - ... ) Hmm, maybe I'm mixing up some terms. Alternatively, I think the formula for d is 1 over the square root of [ (h² + k² + l²) / a² + ... something involving the angles ].

Wait another approach: the general formula for interplanar distance in a crystal is:

d = (a) / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - (h k
