Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which planet has a higher probability of transiting based on the given information. Let's start by recalling what factors affect the transit probability.

I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the relative size of the planet's orbit to the star's size. The formula I think is P = R_star / a, where R_star is the radius of the star, and a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Wait, or is it the other way around? Let me think. Oh right, the probability is actually (R_star / a) multiplied by something else. Wait, no, more accurately, the transit probability is proportional to (R_star / a) multiplied by the solid angle or something. Wait, no—wait, the chance of the planet's orbit being aligned such that it passes in front of the star from our point of view depends on the ratio of the star's size to the distance of the planet. So the formula is P = (R_star / a) * (1 / (something else?)).

Wait, I think the correct formula is P = (R_star / a) * ( (1 / sqrt(1 - e²)) ), but since both planets have circular orbits, e is zero, so that term is 1. So P = R_star / a. But wait, that would be if the orbital plane is edge-on, which is the only case when a transit happens. So the probability is actually the fraction of all possible orbital inclinations that result in a transit, which is P = (R_star
