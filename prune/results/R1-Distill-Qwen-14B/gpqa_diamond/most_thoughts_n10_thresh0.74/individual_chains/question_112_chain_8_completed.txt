Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says we have a state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator, so these are the standard basis states for spin-1/2 particles. The first part asks for the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of another operator whose matrix representation is given by elements Aij. The Aij are hbar/2 when i≠j and 0 otherwise.

Hmm. So the operator in question is a 2x2 matrix with zeros on the diagonal and hbar/2 elsewhere. Let me write that out. So for a 2x2 matrix, it would look like:

[ 0    hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2 0 ]

Wait, wait. Because Aij is hbar/2 if i≠j. So rows and columns are 1 and 2, so A12 and A21 are hbar/2, and the diagonal elements A11 and A22 are zero. So the matrix is:

[[0, ħ/2],
 [ħ/2, 0]]

Wait, but wait. The operator is presumably Hermitian because it's an observable. Let me check: in this case, the matrix is symmetric, so yes, it's Hermitian. So its eigenvalues are real.

The problem is to find the probability of measuring each eigenstate of this operator and then find the average value of the operator.

So first, I think I need to find the eigenstates of this operator A. Because the observable's eigenstates are what we measure probabilities for.

So the operator A is [[0, ħ/2],[ħ/2, 0]]. Let me find its eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

The eigenvalues are found by solving det(A - λI) = 0.

So the matrix becomes:
[ -λ     ħ/2 ]
[ ħ/2   -λ ]

The determinant is λ^2 - (ħ/2)^2 = 0.

So λ^2 = (ħ^2)/4 → λ = ± ħ/2.

So the eigenvalues are ħ/2 and -ħ/2. Now, the eigenvectors.

For λ = ħ/2:
(A - λ I) v = 0 → [ [-ħ/2, ħ/2], [ħ/2, -ħ/2] ] v = 0.

So the equations are:
(-ħ/2) v1 + (ħ/2) v2 = 0 → -v1 + v2 = 0 → v2 = v1.

So the eigenvector is proportional to (1,1) or any scalar multiple. Let's normalize it. The length would be sqrt(1^2 +1^2)=sqrt(2), so the unit vector is (1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2)).

Similarly, for λ = -ħ/2:
The matrix becomes [ [ ħ/2, ħ/2 ], [ ħ/2, ħ/2 ] ].

Equations: (ħ/2) v1 + (ħ/2) v2 =0 → v1 + v2 = 0 → v2 = -v1.

So the eigenvector is proportional to (1, -1). Normalized, it's (1/sqrt(2), -1/sqrt(2)).

So the eigenstates of A are |+> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and |-> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

Wait, wait. Let me make sure I got the order right. Since the first eigenvector is (1,1), which corresponds to |up> + |down>, so that's |+x> if we're talking about spin in x-direction. So the eigenstates are the standard spin-up and spin-down in the x-direction.

Ok, so the state |alpha> is given as proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 -i) |down>.

But before I can find the probabilities of measuring each eigenstate of A, I need to express |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of A, which are |+> and |->.

So let me write |alpha> as a linear combination of |+> and |->.

But first, perhaps it's easier to normalize |alpha> first. Because the given state is proportional to that expression.

The state is |alpha> = C [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ], where C is a normalization constant.

Wait, actually, the question says it's proportional, so we can find C by normalizing.

Compute the norm: (1+i) (1-i) + (2 -i)(2 +i) = (1 +1) + (4 + 2i -2i + 1) → 2 + (4 +1) = 2 +5=7. So the squared magnitude is 7. So |C| must be 1/sqrt(7) because the state is normalized.

So |alpha> = [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

Now, to express |alpha> in terms of |+> and |->, which are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

Let me write |alpha> as a combination of |+> and |->.

Let’s denote |alpha> = a |+> + b |->.

So,

|alpha> = a (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) + b (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2)
= [ (a + b) |up> + (a - b) |down> ] / sqrt(2)

But from earlier, |alpha> is [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7)

So equating the coefficients:

( a + b ) / sqrt(2) = (1 + i)/sqrt(7)
( a - b ) / sqrt(2) = (2 - i)/sqrt(7)

We can write this as a system of equations:

a + b = (1+i)/sqrt(7) * sqrt(2)
a - b = (2 -i)/sqrt(7) * sqrt(2)

Let me compute the right-hand sides.

sqrt(2)/sqrt(7) is sqrt(2/7).

So,

a + b = (1+i) * sqrt(2/7)
a - b = (2 - i) * sqrt(2/7)

Now, adding these two equations:

2a = [ (1+i) + (2 -i) ] * sqrt(2/7)
= (3) * sqrt(2/7)
→ a = (3/2) * sqrt(2/7)

Subtracting the second equation from the first:

2b = [ (1+i) - (2 -i) ] * sqrt(2/7)
= (1+i -2 +i) ) * sqrt(2/7)
= (-1 + 2i) * sqrt(2/7)
→ b = (-1 + 2i) * (sqrt(2/7))/2

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the signs. Let me recheck:

a + b = (1+i) * sqrt(2/7)
a - b = (2 -i) * sqrt(2/7)

Adding: 2a = (1+i + 2 -i) * sqrt(2/7) → (3) * sqrt(2/7) → a = (3/2) sqrt(2/7)

Subtracting: (a + b) - (a - b) ) = [1+i - (2 -i)] sqrt(2/7) → 2b = (1+i -2 +i) sqrt(2/7) → 2b = (-1 +2i) sqrt(2/7) → b = (-1 +2i) (sqrt(2/7) ) / 2.

Wait, maybe I should compute a and b using complex numbers.

But perhaps a better approach is to solve for a and b.

Let me let a = [ (1+i) + (2 -i) ] / (2 sqrt(7/2)) )

Wait, maybe I should instead write it as:

Let me compute a + b = (1+i) / sqrt(7) * sqrt(2) → this is (1+i) * sqrt(2/7)

Similarly, a - b = (2 -i) * sqrt(2/7)

So,

a = [ (a + b) + (a - b) ] / 2 = [ (1+i + 2 -i ) * sqrt(2/7) ] / 2 → (3 * sqrt(2/7)) ) / 2

Similarly, b = [ (a + b) - (a - b) ] / 2 → [ (1+i - (2 -i) ) * sqrt(2/7) ] /2 → [ (1+i -2 +i) * sqrt(2/7) ] / 2 → [ (-1 + 2i ) * sqrt(2/7) ] / 2

So,

a = (3/2) sqrt(2/7)
b = (-1 + 2i) ( sqrt(2/7) ) / 2

But perhaps I should compute the magnitude squared of a and b to find the probabilities.

Wait, the probability of measuring eigenvalue ħ/2 is |a|^2, and the probability of -ħ/2 is |b|^2.

So let's compute |a|^2 and |b|^2.

Compute |a|^2:

a = (3/2) * sqrt(2/7)
So |a|^2 = (9/4) * (2/7) = (9*2)/(4*7) )= 18/(28) = 9/14 ≈ 0.64286.

Wait, that's about 0.64286, which is close to option A's 0.64.

Then |b|^2 is [ (sqrt(2/7)/2 ) * | -1 + 2i | ]^2.

Compute |-1 + 2i|: sqrt( (-1)^2 + (2)^2 )= sqrt(1+4)=sqrt(5).

So |b|^2 = [ (sqrt(2/7)/2 ) * sqrt(5) ]^2 → ( (sqrt(2/7) * sqrt(5)) / 2 )^2 → ( (sqrt(10/7)) / 2 )^2 = (10/7) /4 )= 10/(7*4) )= 10/28 = 5/14 ≈ 0.35714.

Wait, but let me recalculate. Let's see:

Wait, wait, no. Because b is [ (-1 +2i) * sqrt(2/7) ] /2.

So the magnitude squared is | (-1+2i) |^2 * (2/7) / (4).

Wait, |(-1 + 2i)|^2 is (1)^2 + (2)^2 = 1 +4=5.

So |b|^2 = (5) * (2/7) /4 → 5 * (2)/(7*4) )= 10/(28) = 5/14 ≈ 0.35714.

Wait, but 9/14 is approximately 0.64286, and 5/14 is approx 0.35714. So the probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A has 0.64 and 0.36, which are close but not exactly matching. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of a and b. Let me double-check.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute the expansion coefficients correctly.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Let me think about the state |alpha> and the eigenstates of A.

Alternatively, since the eigenstates of A are |+> and |->, we can express |alpha> in terms of |+> and |-> and find the expansion coefficients.

So |alpha> = c_+ |+> + c_- |->.

The probabilities are |c_+|^2 and |c_-|^2.

So perhaps I should calculate c_+ and c_-.

We can compute c_+ as the inner product of |alpha> and |+>, and c_- as the inner product with |->.

So,

c_+ = < + | alpha > 
= (1/sqrt(2)) [ <up| + <down| ] * (1+i |up> + (2 -i) |down> ) / sqrt(7)
= (1/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(7))) [ (1+i) + (2 -i) ]
= (1/(sqrt(14))) [ 1 + i + 2 - i ]
= (3) / sqrt(14)

Similarly, c_- = < - | alpha > 
= (1/sqrt(2)) [ <up| - <down| ] * (1+i |up> + (2 -i)|down> ) / sqrt(7)
= (1/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(7))) [ (1+i) - (2 -i) ]
= (1/(sqrt(14))) [ 1 + i -2 + i ]
= ( (-1 + 2i) ) / sqrt(14)

So c_+ is 3/sqrt(14), and c_- is (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14).

Now, the probabilities are |c_+|^2 and |c_-|^2.

|c_+|^2 = (9)/(14) ≈ 0.64286.

|c_-|^2 = [ (-1 + 2i) (-1 -2i) ] / (14)
= [ (1 + 2i -2i - (2i)^2) ] /14 
Wait, no, wait. Let me compute the magnitude squared correctly.

Wait, (-1 + 2i) multiplied by its conjugate is (-1 -2i).

So (-1 +2i)(-1 -2i) = (-1)^2 + (2i)^2 -1*(2i) + 2i*(-1)?

Wait, no, better compute it as (a + b)(a* - b*), which for a=-1, b=2i:

(-1 + 2i)(-1 -2i) = (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-2i) + (2i)(-1) + (2i)(-2i)
= 1 + 2i -2i -4i^2
= 1 + 0i -4(-1)
= 1 +4=5.

So |c_-|^2 =5/14 ≈ 0.35714.

So the probabilities are approximately 9/14 (≈0.6429) and 5/14 (≈0.3571).

Looking at the options, option A is 0.64 and 0.36, which are close but not exact. However, let me check the options.

Option A: 0.64, 0.36, and hbar/7.

Hmm. Wait, but perhaps I made a miscalculation in the expansion.

Wait, let me recompute c_+:

c_+ = < + | alpha >.

Expressed as (1/sqrt(2)) [ <up| + <down| ] * [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7)

So:

= (1/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(7)) ) [ (1+i) + (2 -i) ]

Compute (1+i) + (2 -i) = 3 + 0i.

So c_+ = 3/(sqrt(14)).

So |c_+|² = 9/14 ≈ 0.64286.

Similarly, c_- = < - | alpha >

= (1/sqrt(2)) [ <up| - <down| ] * [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7)

= (1/(sqrt(14)) ) [ (1+i) - (2 -i) ]
= (1/(sqrt(14)) ) [1 +i -2 +i ]
= (1/(sqrt(14)) ) [ (-1) + 2i ]

So the magnitude squared is [ (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ] / 14 = (1 +4)/14=5/14 ≈0.35714.

So the probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14, which are approximately 0.6429 and 0.3571.

Looking back at the options, the first part of the options gives pairs of probabilities, and the third part is the expectation value.

Now, the second part of the question is to find the average value of the operator A.

The average value is <A> = <alpha| A |alpha>.

Since A is a 2x2 matrix, perhaps it's easier to compute this using the matrix representation.

Let me write |alpha> as a column vector. Since |alpha> is [ (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> ] / sqrt(7), the vector is (1+i, 2 -i )^T divided by sqrt(7).

So |alpha> vector: [ (1+i), (2 -i) ]^T / sqrt(7).

The operator A is [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]].

So <A> is the conjugate transpose of |alpha> multiplied by A multiplied by |alpha>.

So compute:

(1/sqrt(7)) [ (1-i) , (2 +i) ] * A * (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i), (2 -i) ]^T

= (1/7) [ (1-i) (0)(1+i) + (1-i)(ħ/2)(2 -i) + (2 +i)(ħ/2)(1+i) + (2 +i)(0)(2 -i) ]

Wait, perhaps a better way is to compute matrix multiplication.

Wait, more accurately, let me compute <alpha| A |alpha>:

= (1/7) [ (1-i)  (2 + i) ] * A * (1/7) [ (1+i); (2 -i) ]

Wait, no. Let me think: the conjugate transpose of |alpha> is (1-i, 2 +i) for the first row.

So:

<alpha| A |alpha> = (1/7) [ (1-i)   (2 +i) ] * A * [ (1+i); (2 -i) ] / sqrt(7)

Wait, perhaps correct way:

Let me compute |alpha> as a column vector: [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ; (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ]

Then, <alpha| is [ (1 -i)/sqrt(7), (2 +i)/sqrt(7) ]

So, <alpha| A |alpha> is:

[ (1 -i)/sqrt(7), (2 +i)/sqrt(7) ] * A * [ (1+i)/sqrt(7); (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ]

Compute A * |alpha> first.

A * |alpha> = [0 * (1+i) + (ħ/2) * (2 -i) ] / sqrt(7) in first component,
and [ (ħ/2) * (1+i) + 0 * (2 -i) ] / sqrt(7) in second component.

So A|alpha> = [ (ħ/2)(2 -i), (ħ/2)(1+i) ]^T / sqrt(7).

Then, <alpha| A |alpha> is the conjugate transpose of |alpha> multiplied by A|alpha>.

Which is:

[ (1 -i)/sqrt(7), (2 +i)/sqrt(7) ] * [ (ħ/2)(2 -i) / sqrt(7) , (ħ/2)(1 +i) / sqrt(7) ]^T

Which is:

(1/sqrt(7)) * (1/(sqrt(7))) ) [ (1 -i)(ħ/2)(2 -i) + (2 +i)(ħ/2)(1 +i) ]

Factor out ħ/2 * 1/(7):

= (ħ/2) [ (1 -i)(2 -i) + (2 +i)(1 +i) ] / 7

Compute each term:

(1 -i)(2 -i) = 2*(1) + 1*(-i) -i*(2) + i^2

= 2 -i -2i -1 → (2-1) + (-3i) → 1 -3i.

Similarly, (2 +i)(1 +i) = 2*1 + 2i +i*1 + i^2 → 2 +3i -1 → 1 +3i.

Sum of these two terms: (1 -3i) + (1 +3i) = 2 + 0i.

So,

(ħ/2) * (2) /7 → (ħ/2) * 2/7 → ħ/7.

So the average value is ħ/7.

Now, looking back at the probabilities, we have approximately 0.643 and 0.357, which correspond to 9/14 and 5/14. Looking at the options:

Option A: 0.64, 0.36, and ħ/7. So the probabilities are 0.64 (9/14 ≈0.6429) and 0.36 (5/14≈0.3571). The average is ħ/7 which matches option A.

Wait, but let me check the options again. Option A says probabilities 0.64 and 0.36, which would correspond to 9/14 and 5/14, which is exactly what we have.

So the correct answer would be option A.


To solve the problem, we analyze the given quantum state and operator. The state is given as:

\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{(1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle}{\sqrt{7}},
\]

where \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) are the eigenstates of the \( z \)-component of the spin operator. The operator \( A \) has the matrix representation:

\[
A = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{\hbar}{2} \\
\frac{\hbar}{2} & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 1: Eigenstates of \( A \)
The eigenvalues of \( A \) are found by solving \( \det(A - \lambda I) = 0 \), yielding \( \lambda = \pm \frac{\hbar}{2} \). The corresponding eigenstates are:

\[
|+\rangle = \frac{|\uparrow\rangle + |\downarrow\rangle}{\sqrt{2}}, \quad |-\rangle = \frac{|\uparrow\rangle - |\downarrow\rangle}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

### Step 2: Express \( |\alpha\rangle \) in terms of \( |+\rangle \) and \( |-\rangle \)
The state \( |\alpha\rangle \) is expressed as:

\[
|\alpha\rangle = c_+ |+\rangle + c_- |-\rangle,
\]

where the coefficients \( c_+ \) and \( c_- \) are calculated as:

\[
c_+ = \langle +|\alpha\rangle = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}}, \quad c_- = \langle -|\alpha\rangle = \frac{-1 + 2i}{\sqrt{14}}.
\]

The probabilities of measuring the eigenstates \( |+\rangle \) and \( |-\rangle \) are:

\[
P(+\rangle) = |c_+|^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.643, \quad P(-\rangle) = |c_-|^2 = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.357.
\]

### Step 3: Average value of \( A \)
The expectation value of \( A \) is:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \langle \alpha| A |\alpha\rangle.
\]

Using the matrix representation of \( A \) and the state \( |\alpha\rangle \), the calculation yields:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

### Step 4: Match with options
The probabilities \( 0.643 \) and \( 0.357 \) correspond to approximately \( 0.64 \) and \( 0.36 \), respectively, and the average value is \( \frac{\hbar}{7} \). This matches **Option A**.

**Answer: A**
