Okay, so I need to find the pH of a solution that's a mixture of three different solutions: acetic acid, HCl, and barium hydroxide. Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but let's break it down step by step.

Wait, first, I remember that mixing acids and bases can lead to neutralization reactions. So maybe I should figure out how much acid and base I have in terms of moles and see what's left after they react.

Let me list the solutions again:

1. 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH (acetic acid)
2. 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl (a strong acid)
3. 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2 (a strong base because Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, right?)

I think the first step is to calculate the moles of each component in each solution.

For CH3COOH, moles = Molarity * Volume (in liters). So 0.1 M * 0.5 L = 0.05 moles.

HCl is a strong acid, so each molecule gives one H+ ion. So moles of HCl = 0.2 M * 0.4 L = 0.08 moles of H+.

Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. Each Ba(OH)2 gives two OH- ions. So moles of OH- = 2 * (0.3 M * 0.3 L) = 2 * 0.09 = 0.18 moles of OH-.

Wait, but when you mix an acid and a base, they react. The reaction is H+ + OH- â†’ H2O. So the H+ comes from both CH3COOH and HCl, but wait, CH3COOH is a weak acid, so it doesn't dissociate completely. HCl is a strong acid, so it does. So the H+ from HCl is 0.08 moles, and from CH3COOH, it's negligible compared to the strong acid, but wait, no, because we have a strong base that can neutralize some of it. Hmm, maybe I should calculate the total H+ and OH- first.

Wait, maybe it's better to consider all the H+ and OH- in the solution:

Total H+
