Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it carefully.

The question involves a series of reactions starting from compound A and ending up with compound E. There are also some hints provided, which I should definitely consider.

Let me break down each step first.

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to produce compound B.
2. Compound B undergoes reduction with H2 and Pd to form compound C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 to form compound D.
4. Compound D loses an inert gas to form compound E.

And there are two hints:
a) Compound A, when reacted with an unknown phosphorous ylide, forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane.
b) The IR of A has a strong peak around 1750 cm^-1, and E's IR is around 1715 cm^-1.

Hmm, the IR peaks are important. So looking at that, compound A has a peak around 1750, which is typical for a carbonyl group, maybe a ketone or an ester or something. E's peak is around 1715, which is a bit lower than 1750. A ketone usually absorbs around 1700-1750. So maybe E is a ketone as well. But the exact position can vary based on substituents.

Now, looking at hint a). So when A reacts with a phosphorous ylide, it forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. A phosphorous ylide is usually used in the Wittig reaction. The Wittig reaction converts aldehydes or ketones into alkenes. So A must have a carbonyl group because that's what the Wittig reacts with.

Wait, so A has a carbonyl group. When it reacts with the ylide, it forms an alkene. The product is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Let me try to visualize that structure.

The product has a cyclopentane ring. At positions 1 and 2, there are methyl groups. Then at position 4, there's a propan-2-ylidene group. Propan-2-ylidene is a methylene group attached to a propane, but the substituents would be on the second carbon. Wait, propan-2-ylidene is CH2-C(CH3)2? No, wait, propan-2-ylidene would be CH2-C(CH2?) Hmm, maybe I should draw it.

Propan-2-ylidene would be CH2-C(CH3)=. So when attached to cyclopentane at position 4, that's a substituent. So the structure is cyclopentane with methyl groups at 1 and 2, and at 4 a CH2-C(CH3)= group? Or perhaps the substituent is a propenylidene group.

Wait, the product is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. So the substituent at position 4 is a propan-2-ylidene group. Propan-2-ylidene would have a structure like CH2–C(CH3)–, but wait, in the ylide, the structure would be more like CH2=C(CH3)–. But I'm not entirely sure.

But the important thing is that A, when reacted with a ylide, forms an alkene. So A must have a carbonyl group, which after the Wittig reaction becomes an alkene. So A must be a ketone or aldehyde. But since A's product with HCN is compound B, let's think about that.

HCN adds to carbonyl groups to form cyanohydrins, I think. So if A is a ketone, reacting with HCN would give a cyanohydrin. So compound B would have a hydroxyl group and a cyano group attached to the same carbon.

Wait, no. The cyanohydrin addition typically adds HCN to a ketone or aldehyde. For aldehydes, it would form RCH(OH)CN. For ketones, same idea but starting from a ketone.

So for instance, if A is a cyclopentanone, then reacting with HCN would give a cyanohydrin. Let me think: cyclopentanone plus HCN would give 3-cyanocyclopentanol or something similar.

But wait, I'm not sure about the position. Let me think: cyclopentanone is a five-membered ring with a ketone. HCN adds to the carbonyl, so the ketone becomes an alcohol and a cyanide. So the product would have a hydroxyl group and a nitrile group on adjacent carbons.

Wait, maybe I should think about the structure of compound B. So when A (a ketone) reacts with HCN, it forms B, which is a cyanohydrin. Then, B is reduced with H2 and Pd to form C. Pd and H2 is for hydrogenation. So in the presence of H2 and Pd, what happens to a cyanohydrin?

Cyanohydrins have adjacent OH and CN groups. When reduced with H2 and Pd, I think the triple bond (if any) would be saturated, but in this case, the cyanohydrin is a diol with an adjacent nitrile. Wait, no, the cyanohydrin is a secondary alcohol and a nitrile. Upon reduction, the nitrile group (CN) would be reduced to a CH2NH2 group? Or maybe under hydrogenation conditions, Pd would reduce nitriles to amines. Alternatively, perhaps the nitrile is hydrogenated to an amine, but that's not common with H2 and Pd. Wait, more likely, under H2 and a catalyst like Pd, a nitrile would be hydrogenated to an amine. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, let's think again. Cyanohydrin is R2C(OH)CN. Upon hydrogenation, the C≡N would become CH2NH2, but I'm not sure if that's the case. Alternatively, maybe the OH group is getting reduced, but it's already an alcohol; H2 and Pd would typically reduce ketones, not alcohols. Wait, maybe the nitrile is hydrogenated to an amine. So in compound C, the nitrile becomes a CH2NH2 group?

Alternatively, perhaps the nitrile group is converted into an amine via hydrogenation. So R-C≡N becomes R-CH2-NH2.

But wait, perhaps I should think about the reduction more carefully. H2 and Pd, in the presence of a cyanohydrin... So B is a diol (if from a ketone), or a secondary alcohol with a nitrile. Wait, no, a cyanohydrin would have an OH and a CN on adjacent carbons. So for example, if A is cyclopentanone, then B would be 3-cyanocyclopentanol.

When B is reduced with H2 and Pd, which is a catalyst for hydrogenation, perhaps the CN group is hydrogenated to a CH
