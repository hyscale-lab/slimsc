Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

Alright, the problem states that the two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c respectively, both in the positive x-direction. I remember that when dealing with velocities close to the speed of light, we can't just use classical addition; we need to use the relativistic velocity addition formula.

Wait, wait, right. The formula for adding velocities in relativity is (v1 + v2)/(1 + (v1*v2)/c²). So for the relative speed, is that the right approach? Let me see. So astronaut 1 is moving at 0.6c and astronaut 2 at 0.5c, both in the same direction. So if I'm on astronaut 1's frame, I want to find astronaut 2's speed relative to me. Or wait, no, maybe the question is about the relative speed between them. Hmm, but since they're moving in the same direction, I need to compute it from one frame to another.

Wait, no. Each astronaut is moving at their own speed in the same direction. So if I'm in the rest frame of astronaut 1, what's the speed of astronaut 2 from my perspective? Or is it the other way around? Oh, wait no. The question says "relative speed"—so if astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, and astronaut B at 0.5c, both in the positive x-direction, then from the perspective of A, what's B's speed? Or maybe it's the speed of one as observed from the other's frame.

Wait, maybe I should just compute the relative velocity between them. So using the relativistic formula. So v_rel = (v2 - v1)/(1 - (v1*v2)/c²). Because from the frame of the first astronaut, the second is moving at v2 - v1, but considering relativistic effects.

Wait, let me get this right. Let me denote the two velocities as u1 = 0.6c (of astronaut 1) and u2 = 0.5c (of astronaut 2). So in the rest frame of astronaut 1, the speed of astronaut 2 would be (u
