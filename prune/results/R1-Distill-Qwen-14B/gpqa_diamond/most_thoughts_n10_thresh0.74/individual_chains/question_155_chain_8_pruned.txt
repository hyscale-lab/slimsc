Okay, so I have this physics problem here about finding the uncertainty in the P_z operator for a given quantum state. Hmm, I'm a bit new to this, but let me try to break it down.

The problem says that the system is in an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ. The state is given as a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). I need to find the uncertainty ΔP_z.

Wait, right, the uncertainty principle. Oh right, the formula is ΔP_z = sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²). So I need to calculate the expectation values of P_z and P_z squared.

First, I should probably write down the matrix form of P_z. The problem gives it. P_z's matrix is:

Row 1: [ħ, 0, 0]
Row 2: [0, 0, 0]
Row 3: [0, 0, -ħ]

So, P_z is a diagonal matrix with diagonal elements ħ, 0, -ħ.

The state vector, let me denote it as |ψ>, is given as a column vector: (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). Wait, wait, I should check if this vector is normalized. Let me compute the sum of the squares of the elements.

(-1/2)^2 = 1/4, (1/√2)^2 = 1/2, (-1/2)^2 = 1/4. Adding them: 1/4 + 1/2 + 1/4 = 1. So yes, it's normalized. Good.

Now, to find ⟨P_z⟩, I need to compute ψ† P_z ψ.

Since P_z is diagonal, this should be straightforward. Each component of ψ is multiplied by the corresponding diagonal element of P_z and then summed.

So, ψ has components (a, b, c) = (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). Then, ⟨P_z⟩ = a* * (ħ) * a + b* * 0 * b + c* * (-ħ) * c.

Wait, are the components real? Yes, all the elements are real except for P_y, which has imaginary elements, but ψ here is real. So, a is -1/2, b is 1/√2, c is -1/2.

So,

⟨P_z⟩ = (-1/2)*ħ*(-1/2) + (1/√2)*0*(1/√2) + (-1/2)*(-ħ)*(-1/2)

Wait, wait, no, more accurately:

⟨P_z⟩ = a* * P_z_11 * a + b* * P_z_22 * b + c* * P_z_33 * c.

So,

= (-1/2) * ħ * (-1/2) + (1/√2) * 0 * (1/√2) + (-1/2) * (-ħ) * (-1/2)

Calculating each term:

First term: (-1/2) * ħ * (-1/2) = (1/4) ħ.

Second term: (1/√2) * 0 * (1/√2) = 0.

Third term: (-1/2) * (-ħ) * (-1/2) = (-1/2) * (-ħ) * (-1/2) = (-1/2)^2 * (-ħ) → Wait, wait, let me compute it step by step.

Wait, third term: c is -1/2, P_z_33 is -ħ. So it's (-1/2) * (-ħ) * (-1/2). Let me compute this as:

(-1/2) * ( - ħ ) * (-1/2 ) = (-1/2) * ( - ħ * -1/2 )
