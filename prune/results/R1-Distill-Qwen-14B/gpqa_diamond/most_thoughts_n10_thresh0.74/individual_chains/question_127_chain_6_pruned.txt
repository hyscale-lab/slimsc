Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. It's about what happens when a specific diene is heated. The molecule in question is 5-butylnona-2,6-diene. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my IUPAC nomenclature, so I need to think carefully.

First, I should draw the structure of 5-butylnona-2,6-diene. Wait, nona means nine carbons, right? So the parent chain has nine carbons. The diene part is at positions 2 and 6, so double bonds between C2-C3 and C6-C7. Then, there's a butyl group at position 5. Butyl is four carbons. Wait, but 5-butylnona... that would mean the substituent is on carbon 5.

Let me sketch this out. Carbon 1, then 2 (double bond starts here), 3, 4, 5 (where the butyl is), 6 (another double bond), 7, 8, 9. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-C(CH2CH2CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH=CH2? Wait, no. Wait, butyl is four carbons, so it's -CH2CH2CH2CH2-? But wait, the substituent is on carbon 5, so the structure would be:

Positions 1-9: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

At position 5, a butyl group. So that would be:

Carbon 1: CH2-
Carbon 2: CH2=CH- because the double bond starts at 2.
Wait, no. Wait, nona-2,6-diene is CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH=CH-CH2-CH3? Wait, that's not right because the butyl group is attached at position 5.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

1: CH2-
2: CH2=CH-
3: CH2-
4: CH2-
5: C with a butyl group attached, so it's CH(CH2CH2CH2CH3)-
Wait, but wait, the substituent is a butyl group. But butyl can be either n-butyl, iso-butyl, etc. But I think in this context, it's the longest chain, so maybe it's a straight chain. So, position 5
