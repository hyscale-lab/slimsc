Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because reaction mechanisms can be tricky. But let's take it step by step.

The question has two parts, A and B. Let's tackle them one by one.

Starting with reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one reacting with ethyl acrylate in the presence of t-BuOK. Hmm, t-BuOK is a strong, bulky base. I remember that bulky bases tend to favor less substituted positions for elimination, but wait, this is a ketone. Oh wait, ethyl acrylate is an electron-deficient alkene. So maybe it's a Michael addition or some kind of conjugate addition.

Wait, 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. Let me draw the structure. The cyclohexanone has a ketone at position 1. Positions 2 and 6 have methyl groups, and position 2 also has an ethyl group. So the carbonyl is at C1. So the substituents are at C2 (ethyl and methyl) and C6 (methyl). So the cyclohexanone is substituted in such a way that it probably has some ring strain or steric hindrance.

When cyclohexanone derivatives undergo reactions like conjugate additions, the substituents can direct where the nucleophile attacks. But wait, ethyl acrylate is a Michael acceptor, which typically undergoes 1,4-addition. Wait, no—actually, in this case, maybe the ketone is acting as an enolate donor. Alternatively, the base could deprotonate the ketone to form an enolate, which would attack the ethyl acrylate.

Wait, t-BuOK is a strong base. It would deprotonate the ketone to form the enolate. Then, the enolate would attack the alpha, beta-unsaturated ester (ethyl acrylate) in a conjugate addition. So that's a Michael addition—addition to the beta position of the ester.

Wait, the cyclohexanone's enolate would have the negative charge on the alpha carbon. So when it attacks ethyl acrylate, which is CH2=CHCOOEt, the enolate would add to the beta carbon, which is
