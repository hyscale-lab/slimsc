Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

Alright, the problem says that there's a solution with 200.00 cm³, which is 0.2 liters, right? And it contains 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O. The molecular weights are given: KH2PO4 is 136.09 g/mol, and Na2HPO4·2H2O is 177.99 g/mol. Oh, and the temperature is 25°C. The question is about orthophosphate ions, and they give the Ka values for H3PO4: Ka1 is 7.5e-3, Ka2 is 6.2e-8, and Ka3 is 1.8e-12.

Wait, orthophosphate is HPO4^3-, right? Or is it PO4^3-? No, wait. Let's think. The different species are H3PO4, H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, and PO4^3-. So orthophosphate would be the HPO4^2- ion. Or wait, sometimes people refer to the different stages as ortho, meta, etc. Wait, maybe I got that mixed up. No, I think orthophosphate is the HPO4^2- form. Or maybe it's the H2PO4^-? Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Wait, the question says concentration of orthophosphate ions. Let me make sure.

Wait, the problem is about orthophosphate, which is HPO4^3-? Or wait, no, no, wait. H3PO4 is the fully protonated form. When it donates a proton, it becomes H2PO4^- (dihydrogen phosphate). Another proton, and it becomes HPO4^2- (hydrogen phosphate), and another gives PO4^3- (orthophosphate). So the orthophosphate ion is PO4^3-. But wait, sometimes ortho refers to the HPO4^2- form. Hmm, maybe I should check the context. The problem is asking for the concentration of orthophosphate ions. So perhaps it's the HPO4^2- ion.

Wait, but in the solution, we have KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. So let's see: KH2PO4 dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^- ions. Na2HPO4·2H2O dissociates into 2Na+ and HPO4^2- (since Na2HPO4 is sodium hydrogen phosphate). So in solution, we have H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Wait, but in solution, these can interconvert. Because they're in a buffer solution. So the buffer is made of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, right? So the problem is about finding the concentration of HPO4^2- in solution.

Wait, but wait, the solution also contains both of
