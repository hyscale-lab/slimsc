Alright, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Okay, the question is about finding the energy spectrum of a particle in a specific potential. The potential is given as V(r, θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ. Hmm, that looks a bit complicated, but maybe I can break it down.

First, I remember that in two-dimensional problems, especially with polar coordinates, it's often useful to separate the potential into radial and angular parts. Wait, but actually, the potential here seems to depend on both r and θ, which complicates things. But wait, looking closer, the potential is V(r, θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ. Let me see if I can factor this expression somehow.

Let me factor out k r²/2: so, V = (k r² /2) [1 + 3 cos²θ]. That might not help much, but perhaps I can think about the form of the potential. Wait, another approach: perhaps the potential can be expressed in terms of polar coordinates but with some effective change in the angular part.

Wait, I remember that in polar coordinates, the Hamiltonian for a two-dimensional system is H = [- (ħ²/(2m)) (∇²)] + V(r,θ). The Laplacian in polar coordinates is (1/r)(d/dr)(r d/dr) + (1/r²)(d²/dθ²). So, the Hamiltonian would involve terms in r and θ.

But the potential here is V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ. Hmm, maybe I can think of this as a sum of two terms: a purely radial term and an angular-dependent term. Let me split it:

V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² [1 + 3 cos²θ]. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me compute. Let me write it as V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ = (k r²/2)(1 + 3 cos²θ). Hmm, perhaps that's helpful.

Wait, maybe I can rewrite the potential in terms of cos(2θ). Because cos²θ can be expressed as (1 + cos 2θ)/2. Let me try that. So 3 cos²θ = (3/2)(1 + cos 2θ). So substituting that into V:

V(r, θ) = (k r²/2) [1 + (3/2)(1 + cos 2θ) ].

Wait, wait, let me compute it correctly. Because 3 cos²θ = 3*(1 + cos 2θ)/2. So substituting into the original expression:

V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² * (1 + cos 2θ)/2.

Wait, that's (1/2)k r² + (3k r²/4)(1 + cos 2θ). So combining the terms:

= ( (1/2) + 3/4 ) k r² + (3k r²/4) cos 2θ.

Which is (5/4 k r²) + (3k r²/4) cos 2θ.

Hmm, but I'm not sure if that helps. Alternatively, maybe I can think of this as a combination of two potentials: a harmonic oscillator in r and an angular potential.

Wait, but the potential is V(r,θ) = (1/2) k r² + (3/2) k r² cos²θ. Let me factor r²:

V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² [1 + 3 cos²θ]. Or, as k r² (1/2
