Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to find the uncertainty in P_z. Hmm, I remember that the uncertainty is calculated using the formula ΔP_z = sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²). Right, so I need to compute the expectation values of P_z and P_z squared.

Wait, the system is in an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ. The state vector is given as (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2) as a column vector. Oh, and the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z. So the given state is expressed in the eigenbasis of P_z, which is important because the matrix representations are in that basis.

First, I should compute ⟨P_z⟩. Since the state is a column vector, I can calculate it by multiplying the state vector with the P_z matrix and then taking the inner product, or perhaps simply by looking at the components because in the eigenbasis of P_z, the expectation value is just the component-wise product. Oh wait, no. Let me think again.

Wait, the state is |ψ⟩ = [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ]^T. And since the basis is the eigenbasis of P_z, the expectation value ⟨P_z⟩ is the sum of |c_i|^2 multiplied by the corresponding eigenvalues of P_z. Because in each basis state, the eigenvalue is known.

So, the P_z matrix's diagonal elements are the eigenvalues. Looking at P_z's matrix: first row is (ħ, 0, 0), second (0,0,0), third (0,0,-ħ). So the eigenvalues are ħ, 0, -ħ for the respective basis vectors |1⟩, |2⟩, |3⟩.

The state |ψ⟩ is a combination of these basis vectors. The coefficients are c₁ = -1/2 for |1⟩, c₂=1/√2 for |2⟩, c₃ = -1/2 for |3⟩.

So, the probability of each state is |c_i|²:

|c₁|² = (1/2)^2 = 1/4,

|c₂|² = (1/√2)^2 = 1/2,

|c₃|² = (1/2)^2 = 1/4.

Now, the expectation value ⟨P_z⟩ is sum over ( |c_i|² * eigenvalue_i )

So,

⟨P_z⟩ = (1/4)(ħ) + (1/2)(0) + (1/4)(-ħ) = [ (1/4)ħ - (1/4)ħ ] = 0.

Oh, interesting. So ⟨P_z⟩ is zero.

Next, I need to find ⟨P_z²⟩. Since P_z is diagonal in this basis, its square is just each element squared. So P_z squared has eigenvalues (ħ)^2, 0, (-ħ)^2, which are ħ², 0, ħ².

So, ⟨P_z²⟩ is sum of |c_i|² * (eigenvalue_i)^2.

Calculating:

(1/4)(ħ²) + (1/2)(0) + (1/4)(ħ²) = (1/4 + 1/4) ħ² = (1/2) ħ².

So now, the uncertainty ΔP_z is sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²) = sqrt( (1/2 ħ²) - 0 ) = sqrt(1/2 ħ²) = (ħ) * sqrt(1/2) = ħ / sqrt(2).

Wait, but looking at the options, option B is ħ/√2. So the answer should be B.

Wait, let me double-check. Did I compute ⟨P_z⟩ correctly?

Yes. The expectation of P_z is (1/4)ħ - (1/4)ħ = 0. So (0)^2 is zero, so the uncertainty is just sqrt( (1/2 ħ²) ) = ħ / sqrt(2). 

So the correct answer is option B.


To calculate the uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ of the operator $P_z$, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

### Step 1: Compute $\langle P_z \rangle$
The system is in the state $|\psi\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} -1/2 \\ 1/\sqrt{2} \\ -1/2 \end{bmatrix}$, expressed in the eigenbasis of $P_z$. The eigenvalues of $P_z$ are $\hbar$, $0$, and $-\hbar$ for the basis vectors $|1\rangle$, $|2\rangle$, and $|3\rangle$, respectively. The coefficients of the state are $c_1 = -1/2$, $c_2 = 1/\sqrt{2}$, and $c_3 = -1/2$. The probabilities are:

\[
|c_1|^2 = \frac{1}{4}, \quad |c_2|^2 = \frac{1}{2}, \quad |c_3|^2 = \frac{1}{4}.
\]

The expectation value $\langle P_z \rangle$ is:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = |c_1|^2 (\hbar) + |c_2|^2 (0) + |c_3|^2 (-\hbar).
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \frac{1}{4}(\hbar) + \frac{1}{2}(0) + \frac{1}{4}(-\hbar) = 0.
\]

### Step 2: Compute $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$
The eigenvalues of $P_z^2$ are $\hbar^2$, $0$, and $\hbar^2$, corresponding to the eigenvalues of $P_z$. Thus:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = |c_1|^2 (\hbar^2) + |c_2|^2 (0) + |c_3|^2 (\hbar^2).
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{1}{4}(\hbar^2) + \frac{1}{2}(0) + \frac{1}{4}(\hbar^2) = \frac{1}{2} \hbar^2.
\]

### Step 3: Compute $\Delta P_z$
Using the formula for uncertainty:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

Substituting $\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{1}{2} \hbar^2$ and $\langle P_z \rangle = 0$:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2} \hbar^2} = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ is $\frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}$, which corresponds to option **B**.

Answer: B
