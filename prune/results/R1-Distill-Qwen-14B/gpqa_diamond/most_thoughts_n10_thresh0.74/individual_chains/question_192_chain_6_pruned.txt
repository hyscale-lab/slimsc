Alright, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Okay, let's read it carefully.

The question is about an uncharged spherical conductor with a small cavity inside. The conductor has a radius R, and the cavity has radius r, which is smaller than R. The center of the cavity is a distance s away from the center of the conductor. So, imagine a sphere, and inside it, there's a smaller sphere-shaped hole, but not exactly at the center of the big sphere. It's shifted a bit by distance s.

Now, someone puts a small positive charge +q inside this cavity. The question is about finding the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor. The distance from P to the center of the cavity is l. Both L and l are greater than R. Also, the angle between l and s is Î¸.

The options are A, B, C, D, each giving a different formula for E.

Hmm. So I need to figure out what the electric field is at point P. Let's think about what I remember about conductors and electric fields.

First, I recall that for a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium, the electric field inside the conductor material is zero. The charges reside on the surface. Also, if a conductor is neutral, any enclosed charge within a cavity will induce charges on the inner and outer surfaces.

Wait, the conductor is initially uncharged. So when we place a charge +q inside the cavity, what happens? The cavity is inside the conductor, right? So the charges in the conductor will rearrange themselves.

In this situation, the inner surface of the conductor (the surface of the cavity) must have an induced charge of -q, because the conductor is neutral and it must cancel the field inside the conductor. Then, the outer surface must have a charge of +q to balance that, since the total charge of the conductor is zero.

Wait no, wait. Wait, the conductor itself is neutral. So when +q is placed inside the cavity, the conductor is neutral, so the inner surface of the cavity must have -q. But then, since the conductor is neutral, the outer surface must have +q. Because the conductor's total charge is zero, so inner is -q, outer is +q, summing to zero. Wait, no, wait. Wait, no
