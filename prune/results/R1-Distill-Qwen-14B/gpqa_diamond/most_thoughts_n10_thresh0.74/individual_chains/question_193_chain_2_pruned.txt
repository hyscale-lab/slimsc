Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over parallax to the fifth power. So mathematically, I think that's like N ∝ 1 / plx^5. Hmm, right, because the number of stars N is proportional to 1 divided by the parallax (plx) raised to the fifth. 

Wait, what's parallax again? Parallax is a measure of how much a star's position changes in the sky as observed from Earth over six months. The closer a star is, the larger its parallax. So parallax is inversely proportional to distance. Oh right, the formula I remember is plx = 1 / distance (in parsecs). So distance r is inversely proportional to parallax. So if plx increases, the distance is smaller, and vice versa.

The question asks how the number of stars changes with distance. So I need to find how N depends on r. But currently, N is given in terms of parallax. So I should probably express N in terms of r instead.

Given that parallax plx is equal to 1/r (assuming r is in parsecs, which is the usual unit for parallax). So plx = 1/r. If I substitute this into the equation N ∝ 1/plx^5, it becomes N ∝ 1/( (1/r)^5 ) = r^5. Wait, because 1 over (1/r)^5 is r^5. So N is proportional to r^5.

Wait, but wait a minute. Let me make sure I'm not mixing up anything here. So N ∝ 1/plx^5. Since plx = 1/r, substituting gives N ∝ r^5. So as the distance r increases, the number of stars increases as r^5. But wait, does that make sense? Because when you look further away, wouldn't you expect fewer stars? Or maybe the way the question is phrased, it's about the number varying with parallax, so perhaps the initial statement is that in a region, the number of stars varies as 1/plx^5. So for a given region, when you look at different parallaxes (i.e., different distances), how does the number of stars change with distance.

Wait,
