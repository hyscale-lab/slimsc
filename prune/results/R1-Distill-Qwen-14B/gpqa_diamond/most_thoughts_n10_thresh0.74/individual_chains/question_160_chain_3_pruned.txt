Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem is about an aperture shaped like an N-sided polygon. All the apothems are of the same length a. Monochromatic light with wavelength λ is shining vertically along the z-axis onto this aperture. This creates intensity maxima and minima in the far field, and I need to find the angular distance between the first two minima when N is infinitely large. Also, we can use the tanθ ≈ θ approximation because the angles are small.

Hmm, okay. So first, I remember that when light passes through an aperture, it diffracts and creates a pattern called the Fraunhofer diffraction. The angular positions of the minima (dark fringes) depend on the shape of the aperture. For a circular aperture, the first minima occur at θ ≈ 1.22 λ / (diameter), but this is a polygonal aperture, and N is very large, approaching infinity. So maybe as N becomes very large, the polygon becomes a circle? Or perhaps an approximation similar to a circle?

Wait, but wait. No, because even a polygon with a very large N isn't exactly a circle, but the question might be treating it as such. Or maybe it's considering a different scenario.

Wait, the apothems are all the same length a. Apothem is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side. For regular polygons, the apothem a is related to the side length and the number of sides. But if N is infinite, the polygon becomes a circle, right? Because a circle can be thought of as a polygon with an infinite number of sides. So in that case, the apothem a would be the radius of the circle. So the diameter would be 2a.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me think again. For a regular polygon, the apothem is a = (s/(2 tan(π/N))), where s is the side length. So for a given apothem a and N, the side length s is 2a tan(π/N). As N approaches infinity, tan(π/N) ≈ π/N (since π/N is small). So s ≈ 2a (π/N) → as N→infinite, s→0. But that's the side length. So the entire polygon's size would depend on N, but in this problem, the apothems are all same length a regardless of N. So as N increases, the polygon's size (like the radius) remains a. Wait, no, the apothem is a, which for a polygon is the radius of the inscribed circle. So when N approaches infinity, the polygon becomes a circle with radius a. So the diameter would be 2a.

Wait, but in that case, the first minima for a circular aperture is at θ ~ 1.22 λ/(2a) → because the radius is a, so diameter is 2a. So 1.22 λ/(2a) would be 0.61 λ/a. Wait, but that's the angle. Looking at the options, option A is 0.610 λ/a, which is that.

But wait, the question says the angular distance between the first two minima. Wait,
