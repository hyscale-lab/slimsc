Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over parallax to the fifth power. So, N ∝ 1/parallax^5. Hmm. I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax is the apparent shift in the position of a star as seen from Earth due to our orbit around the Sun. The formula I recall is that distance (in parsecs) is 1 divided by the parallax (in arcseconds). So, distance r = 1/parallax. Oh, right, so parallax plx = 1/r.

Wait, but the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance. Let me think about how parallax and distance relate. If a star is farther away, its parallax is smaller because it doesn't appear to move as much in the sky. So plx is inversely proportional to r. So plx = k/r, where k is a constant.

The number of stars N is proportional to 1/plx^5. Substituting plx from above, N ∝ 1/( (k/r) )^5. Let me compute that. (k/r) is plx, so 1/( (k/r)^5 ) is equal to (r^5)/(k^5). So N is proportional to r^5. Wait, no—that's the proportionality. So N ∝ r^5.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check. Parallax plx is 1/r, so 1/plx is r. So 1/plx^5 is r^5. So N ∝ r^5. So as the distance r increases, the number of stars increases with r^5? That seems a bit counter-intuitive because I thought that more distant stars would be fewer in number because they are farther apart. But perhaps the way the question is phrased, it's about the number of stars in a region varying with parallax, which could be due to some other factors.

Alternatively, maybe the number of stars per unit volume increases with distance. Wait no, that doesn't fit. Let me think about this. If parallax is inversely proportional to distance, then as r increases, plx decreases.

Given N ∝ 1/plx^5, and plx = 1/r, so 1/plx
