Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. I'm a bit rusty on my organic chemistry, but I'll do my best.

So the question is about a series of reactions starting with Compound A, which is C3H6. That formula rings a bell—it's either propene or cyclopropane. But wait, propene is C3H6 as well. Hmm. Oh wait, wait, no. Propene is C3H6? Let me think. The formula for alkenes is CnH2n. So for n=3, it's C3H6. That makes sense. So propene is CH2=CH2CH3? No, actually, propene is CH2=CHCH3. So that's probably compound A.

So, the first reaction is bromination in the presence of carbon tetrachloride. Oh, that's a typical bromination of an alkene, probably via an addition reaction. So propene (CH2=CHCH3) reacts with Br2 in CCl4. That would add bromine across the double bond. The product would be 1,2-dibromopropane? Wait, no. Wait, when an alkene reacts with bromine, it adds across the double bond, each Br attaching to adjacent carbons. So propene would add Br2 to become 1,2-dibromopropane. Yeah, that's compound B.

Next, compound B reacts with alcoholic KOH. Alcoholic KOH is a strong base and a good nucleophile. So when a dibromide reacts with a strong base like that, it's probably an elimination reaction. Wait, but wait—alcohol is a solvent, so maybe it's an E2 mechanism. Or if it's a dihalide, maybe it's a double elimination. So 1,2-dibromopropane with KOH (alcohol) would eliminate two molecules of HBr and form an alkene. So eliminating HBr from each adjacent C, you get back propene. Wait, but wait—what if it's a different structure? Let me think. 1,2-dibromopropane is CH2Br-CHBr-CH3. When you treat that with KOH in alcohol, it should eliminate twice. So two HBr molecules would be lost. The structure would dehydrohalogenate to form an alkene. So where's the double bond? Since we're removing H from adjacent C's. The possible products would depend on
