Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about finding the pH of a solution made by mixing three different solutions: acetic acid, hydrochloric acid, and barium hydroxide. Hmm, I think I remember that mixing acids and bases involves neutralization reactions. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I'll list out the given data. The volumes and concentrations are:

- 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH (acetic acid)
- 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl (hydrochloric acid)
- 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2 (barium hydroxide)

I think the first thing to do is to find out how many moles of each acid and base are present. Because when you mix them, some will react, and the excess will determine the pH.

Let's calculate moles for each.

Molarity (M) is moles per liter, so:

Moles = Molarity × Volume (in liters)

For CH3COOH:

Volume is 500 mL, which is 0.5 L. So moles = 0.1 M * 0.5 L = 0.05 moles.

HCl:

400 mL is 0.4 L. Moles = 0.2 M * 0.4 L = 0.08 moles. But wait, HCl is a strong acid, so it dissociates completely, right.

Ba(OH)2: Hmm, the formula is Ba(OH)2. Each formula unit releases 2 OH- ions. So the concentration of OH- is 0.3 M * 2 = 0.6 M? Wait, no. Wait, moles first. 300 mL is 0.3 L. So moles Ba(OH)2 is 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles. Each Ba(OH)2 gives two OH-, so moles of OH- is 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

Wait, but when they react, what happens? Acetic acid is a weak acid, HCl is a strong acid, and Ba(OH)2 is a strong base.

So, I think the reaction steps would involve the bases reacting with the acids.

Wait, but mixing acids and a base. So the base will neutralize some of the acids. Let me think: which is in excess, acid or base?

But wait, the total moles of H+ from the acids and the moles of OH- from the base will determine the excess. Because the reaction between H+ and OH- is H+ + OH- → H2O.

So let's sum up all the H+ and OH-.

Wait, but HCl is a strong acid, so it contributes H+ equal to its moles. CH3COOH is a weak acid; it doesn't fully dissociate, but when you mix it with a strong base, some of it might react. Hmm, but wait, when you have a mixture of acids and a base, they'll react in a certain order.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think of all the H+ and OH
