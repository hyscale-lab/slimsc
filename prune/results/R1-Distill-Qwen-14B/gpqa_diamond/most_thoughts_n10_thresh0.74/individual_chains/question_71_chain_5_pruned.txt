Okay, so I have this question about exoplanets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, let's try to figure this out step by step. I remember that equilibrium temperature is related to the distance from the star and the star's luminosity, but since all planets have the same albedo, maybe that's not a factor here.

Wait, the planets are in orbital resonance and have periods in the ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. So Planet_1 has the shortest period, Planet_5 the longest. I think the equilibrium temperature formula is T = T_star * (L / (16πσ D²))^(1/4), but wait, maybe it's more about the inverse square law. Oh right, the formula is T = T_eff * sqrt(R / (2a)), where R is the star's radius and a is the planet's orbital distance. But wait, another version uses the period because Kepler's third law relates period to distance.

Kepler's third law says that the square of the period (P) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (a), so P² ∝ a³. Since the orbits are circular, a is just the radius. So if I have the period ratios, I can find the a ratios.

The equilibrium temperature formula for a planet is T = T_star * ( (L / (4πσ)) )^(1/4) * (1/(2a))^(1/4) ), but I might be mixing up the exact formula. Wait, more accurately, the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root
