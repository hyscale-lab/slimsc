Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric fields and conductors. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step. 

Alright, the setup is an uncharged spherical conductor with a small cavity inside. The conductor has radius R, and the cavity has radius r, which is smaller than R. The center of the cavity is offset by a distance s from the conductor's center. Then, someone places a small positive charge +q inside the cavity. 

The question is asking about the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is at a distance L from the conductor's center, and the distance from P to the cavity's center is l. Also, the angle between l and s is theta. Both l and L are greater than R, so P is definitely outside the conductor.

Wait, so I remember that when a charge is inside a cavity of a conductor, the conductor's charges rearrange. But since the conductor was initially uncharged, how does the charge distribution work here?

Oh right, the cavity is not concentric. The charge +q in the cavity will induce charges on the inner surface of the conductor. Because the conductor was neutral, the inner surface must have an induced charge of -q, right? But wait, wait. Since the cavity isn't centered, maybe this affects things. Oh, no, wait. The conductor being a conductor, the charges should redistribute themselves such that the inner surface's charge is -q regardless of the position, because the conductor's material allows for free movement of charges.

So the inner surface of the conductor has -q. But since the conductor itself was neutral, what about the outer surface? The total charge on the conductor is zero. The inner surface has -q, so the outer surface must have +q to balance it. Because the conductor's total charge is zero, inner and outer together sum to zero. So inner: -q, outer: +q.

Wait, but the outer surface charge is +q. So the point P is outside the conductor. So the electric field at P would be due to the outer charge, which is +q distributed on the outer surface of the conductor.

But wait, how does the distribution affect the field? For a spherical conductor, the charges on the outer surface would arrange themselves spherically symmetrically if there are no other external fields. But in this case, since the point P is at a distance L from the center, and the conductor is a sphere, the outer surface's charge would still produce a field as if all the charge were concentrated at the center, right?

Wait, but the conductor is a sphere, so even if the cavity's center is offset (s distance away), the outer surface charge should still be uniformly distributed, assuming the conductor is a perfect conductor. Because any external fields would cause charges to move, but in this case, the conductor is neutral except for the induced charges, so the outer surface should be spherical, and thus the field outside would be as if all the charge were at the center.

Wait, but the cavity's displacement might influence the inner charge distribution but not the outer. Since the outer is a sphere, the +q charge on the outer surface would create an electric field at point P that depends only on the distance from the center of the conductor.

So the electric field at point P outside the conductor (distance L from the center) is due to the +q charge on the outer surface. The field would be E =
