Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about the density matrix of a qubit and its geometrical position in the qubits space. Hmm.

The given density matrix is ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). Wait, I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's in a mixed state. So, pure states are described by density matrices that are projectors (like |ψ⟩⟨ψ|), but mixed states are statistical ensembles.

So, what does this ρ represent? Let me compute it. The matrix |0⟩⟨0| is a 2x2 matrix with 1 in the (1,1) position and zeros elsewhere. Similarly, |1⟩⟨1| has 1 in the (2,2) position. Adding them together gives a diagonal matrix with [1, 0; 0, 1]. Then, multiplying by 1/2, each diagonal element becomes 1/2. So ρ is [[0.5, 0], [0, 0.5]].

Wait, that's the density matrix. Now, I remember that the Bloch sphere representation is a way to visualize qubit states. For a pure state |ψ⟩ = cos(θ/2)|0⟩ + e^{iφ} sin(θ/2)|1⟩, the density matrix is |ψ⟩⟨ψ|, which corresponds to a point on the Bloch sphere with coordinates (x, y, z) = (sinθ cosφ, sinθ sinφ, cosθ).

But in this case, ρ is a mixed state because it's a mixture of |0⟩ and |1⟩. Wait, actually, ρ is a diagonal matrix with both diagonal elements equal. So it's a completely mixed state because it's like being in a uniform superposition of the two basis states, but since it's a classical mixture (not quantum), it's the maximally mixed state.

How does this translate into the Bloch sphere? Oh right, the Bloch vector for a density matrix ρ is given by a vector r such that ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices. So let's compute that.

The Pauli matrices are σx = [[0,1],[1,0]], σy = [[0,-i],[i,0]], σz = [[1,0],[0,-1]]. 

So the right-hand side is (I + r_x σx + r_y σy + r_z σz)/2. Let's write that out.

(I is [[1,0],[0,1]]). So:

(1/2)[[1, 0], [0, 1]] + (1/2)[r_x [ [0,1], [1,0] ] + r_y [ [0,-i], [i,0] ] + r_z [ [1,0], [0,-1] ] ]

So overall, the (1,1) element is (1 + r_z)/2, the (2,2) element is (1 - r_z)/2. The (1,2) element is (r_x - i r_y)/2, and the (2,1) is (r_x + i r_y)/2.

Our ρ is [[0.5, 0], [0, 0.5]]. So looking at the off-diagonal elements, we have (r_x - i r_y)/2 = 0. Which implies r_x = 0 and r_y = 0.

Now, the diagonal elements: (1 + r_z)/2 = 0.5 → 1 + r_z = 1 → r_z = 0.

Wait, that can't be right. Because for the diagonal elements to be 0.5, (1 + r_z)/2 = 0.5 → r_z = 0. Similarly, (1 - r_z
