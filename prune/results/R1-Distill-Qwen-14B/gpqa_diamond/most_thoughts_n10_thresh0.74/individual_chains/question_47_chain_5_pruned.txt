Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure out which compound is C9H11NO2 based on the spectral data provided. Let me start by breaking down the given data and see what I can deduce.

First, the molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation to get an idea of the structure. The formula is C9H11NO2. The degree of unsaturation (DoU) is calculated as (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, X is 0, so it becomes (2*9 +2 -11 -0 +1)/2. That's (20-11+1)/2 = 10/2=5. So there are 5 degrees of unsaturation. That could be from a benzene ring (which accounts for 3 DoU), a double bond (another 1), and maybe an amide or ester group (which have a double bond each, so two more? Wait, but the sum is 5. Benzene is 3, maybe an ester (which has two double bonds, but one is from the carbonyl and the other from the ester oxygen). Hmm, not sure, but let's move on to the spectral data.

Looking at the IR data: strong to medium bands at 3420 and 3325 cm-1. Those are probably N-H stretches. Since the intensity is medium to strong, maybe it's an amide or maybe a primary amine? Wait, but if it's an amide, the N-H is usually around 3300-3500 as a broad peak. Alternatively, for a primary amine, it's a strong and broad peak. But wait, the IR also shows a strong band at 1720 cm^-1. That's a carbonyl group. 1720 is typical for an ester or amide. For esters, the carbonyl is around 1720-1750. For amides, it's about 1650-1700, but can vary.

So the carbonyl at 1720 suggests an ester or possibly an acylimidamide? Wait, but amides have N-H, so maybe the molecule has both an amide and an ester? Or perhaps it's an ester with an amine elsewhere. Hmm.

Looking at the 1H NMR data:

- 1.20 ppm (t, 3H): This is a triplet, likely from a CH2CH3 group. So maybe an ethyl ester or ethyl group attached to something.
- 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H): Broad singlet integrating for 2H. Could this be an NH2 group? But if it's an NH2, I would expect it to be a broad peak, but in the IR, we have N-H stretches. Alternatively, maybe it's an OCH2 group. Wait, but the integration is 2H, maybe a methylene adjacent to an electronegative group, like OCH2CO, but why is it a broad singlet? Or perhaps a CH2 connected
