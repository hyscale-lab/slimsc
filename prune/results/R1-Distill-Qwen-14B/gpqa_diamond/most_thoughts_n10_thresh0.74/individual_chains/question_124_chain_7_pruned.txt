Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The question says that particles are collided at the center of a spherical detector. These particles are new types that travel at ultra-relativistic velocities with a Lorentz factor of about 20. On average, one third of these particles reach the inner walls of the detector. The radius of the detector is 30 meters. Now, they're asking what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of these particles reach the inner walls.

Hmm. So, I think the key here is to understand how the Lorentz factor affects the distance the particles travel before decaying or reaching the detector walls. Since the particles are fast-decaying, their decay length must be a factor here. The decay length is the average distance a particle travels before decaying. 

Wait, so if the particles are produced at the center of the detector, the maximum distance they can travel is the radius of the detector, which is 30 meters. If a particle decays after traveling a distance less than this, it won't reach the inner walls. So the fraction of particles that reach the walls depends on the decay length relative to the detector's radius.

In the initial case, with a Lorentz factor (gamma) of 20, one third of the particles reach the walls. That means that the decay length is such that only one third of them are longer than the detector's radius. Wait, no, wait. Or maybe it's the other way aroundâ€”since the decay is random, the fraction that reach the walls is the probability that their decay length is longer than the detector's radius. So, if the decay length is much larger than the radius, more particles will reach the walls.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think. The decay length L is gamma multiplied by the proper lifetime (tau) multiplied by the speed of light (c), so L = gamma * c * tau. Since the particles are ultra-relativistic, their speed is approximately c, so the distance they travel before decaying is roughly L = gamma * c * tau.

The detector has a radius R = 30 meters. So the probability that a particle decays after traveling a distance greater than R is probably related to the ratio R/L. But wait, the probability distribution for decay is exponential. The probability that a particle hasn't decayed by distance
