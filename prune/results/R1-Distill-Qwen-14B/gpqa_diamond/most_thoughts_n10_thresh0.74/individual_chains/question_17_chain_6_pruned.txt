Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll take it slow.

The question says: What's the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing 0.02 M stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex? The pH is ideal, temperature is 25°C, and the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10. The options are A to D.

Wait, so I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent. It forms complexes with metal ions like Ca²+. The complex here is Ca-EDTA, so it's probably the calcium EDTA complex, maybe like CaY²- where Y is the EDTA^4- ion.

The formation constant, K, for a complex is a measure of how strong the complex is. A higher K means the complex is more stable. So the formula for the formation constant is K = [CaY²-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]). Or wait, sometimes EDTA exists in different protonated forms, but the problem states pH is ideal, so maybe we can assume that EDTA is mostly in the Y^4- form. So the dissociation is straightforward.

The problem gives me that the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M. So that's the concentration of [CaY²-], right? Because it's a stoichiometric solution, meaning all the Ca is tied up in the complex. So [CaY²-] = 0.02 M.

Now, because the complex dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-, but given the high K value (5e10), the complex is very stable. So the concentrations of free Ca²+ and free EDTA^4- would be very low.

Wait, wait. Let me write the equilibrium equation. The formation of the complex is:

Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA²-

The formation constant K is given by K = [CaEDTA²-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]).

So rearranging, [Ca²+] = [CaEDTA²-] / (K * [EDTA^4-]).

Wait, but wait. If the solution is 0.02 M CaEDTA²-, and assuming that the EDTA comes from the dissociation of the complex, but since K is so large, the dissociation is very little. So perhaps the concentration of EDTA^4- in solution is approximately equal to the concentration of the complex?

No, no. Wait, let me think again. The total EDTA in solution would be the sum of the free EDTA^4- and the complex. But if K is very large, the complex doesn't dissociate much, so [EDTA^4-] would be very small compared to [CaEDTA²-]. But wait, wait. The problem says it's a stoichiometric solution, meaning that all the Ca and EDTA are in the complex. Or does it mean that the concentration is based on stoichiometry like 1:1?

Wait, the term 'stoichiometric' here might mean that the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, and
