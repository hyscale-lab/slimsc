Okay, so I've got this question about optical isomerism in organic compounds. Hmm, optical isomerism... I think that's when a compound has the ability to rotate plane-polarized light because it has chiral centers. Chiral centers are atoms, usually carbon, bonded to four different groups. If a molecule has a chiral center, it can have stereoisomers like enantiomers, which are non-superimposable mirror images. These enantiomers are what cause optical activity.

The question gives four compounds and asks which show optical isomerism. Let me go through each one step by step.

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. So, I'm picturing a biphenyl structure where each phenyl ring has substituents. The positions are 6,6' for the nitro groups and 2,2' for the carboxylate groups. Wait, carboxylate is a substituent on the benzene rings. The question is whether this molecule has a chiral center. Biphenyls can sometimes have axial chirality if the substituents are arranged in such a way that the molecule isn't planar. Oh wait, axial chirality is when there's a twist in the structure, making it chiral. So if the substituents are arranged differently on each ring, causing the molecule to have a non-superimposable mirror image, then it can have optical isomerism.

But wait, the substituents here are at
