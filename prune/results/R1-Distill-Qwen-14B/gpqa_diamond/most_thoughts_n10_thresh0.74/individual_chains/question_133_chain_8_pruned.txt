Okay, so I have this problem about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution. Hmm, let me think about what I know. The solution has 200.00 cm³, which is 0.2 liters. It contains 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O. The molar masses are given as 136.09 g/mol and 177.99 g/mol respectively. The temperature is 25°C, which probably matters for the K values.

Wait, the question is about the concentration of orthophosphate ions. Orthophosphate is HPO4^2-, right? Because H3PO4 can dissociate into H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, and PO4^3-.

I remember that when you have a mixture of a weak acid and its conjugate base, you can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. Oh wait, but in this case, one is the acid and the other is the base. Let me see: KH2PO4 is H2PO4^-·K^+ (so it's the acid form, H2PO4^- can donate a proton to become HPO4^2-). And Na2HPO4·2H2O is Na+·HPO4^2-·2H2O, so it's the conjugate base of H2PO4^-.

So the two substances are H2PO4^- (acid) and HPO4^2- (base). So this is a buffer solution. The buffer equation is pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]). But wait, the question is about the concentration of HPO4^2- in solution, which is the base part of the equation.

To find the concentration, I think I need to find the moles of each, then calculate their concentrations. Then, using the buffer equation, I can relate the pH to the ratio, but maybe I don't need the pH directly. Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the pH first and then find the concentration.

Wait, let me outline the steps:

1. Calculate the moles of KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O.
2. Convert the volume to liters (which I did, 0.2 L).
3. Find the concentrations
