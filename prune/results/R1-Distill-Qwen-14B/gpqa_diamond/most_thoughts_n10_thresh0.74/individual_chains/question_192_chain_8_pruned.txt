Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this physics problem about electric fields around a spherical conductor with a cavity. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

Alright, the setup is: there's an uncharged spherical conductor of radius R. Inside it, there's a small spherical cavity. The center of the cavity is a distance s away from the center of the conductor. The radius of the cavity is r, and r is less than R. So the conductor is bigger than the cavity, and the cavity isn't at the center of the conductor but offset by s.

Then, a small positive charge +q is placed somewhere inside the cavity. The question is asking about the electric field E at a point P, which is outside the conductor. Point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor. The distance from P to the center of the cavity is l, and l and L are both greater than R. The angle between l and s is theta.

Hmm, I remember that when charges are inside a cavity of a conductor, the conductor's charges rearrange themselves. But wait, the conductor was initially uncharged. So when you put a charge inside the cavity, the conductor's charges respond.

Wait, the conductor was uncharged, so when a charge +q is placed inside the cavity, the conductor's interior must induce a charge. I think the cavity's inner surface will have an induced charge of -q because the conductor's material is a conductor. But that's only if the conductor is conducting, right? So the conductor is a shell with a cavity. So any charge inside the cavity would cause the inner surface of the conductor to have an induced charge of equal magnitude but opposite sign. So inner surface has -q.

But since the conductor itself was neutral, the outer surface must have +q to balance it out. Because the total charge of the conductor is zero before and after. So inner surface: -q, outer surface: +q.

Wait, but wait. The conductor is a single shell. So the outer surface would have a charge +q, because the inner surface has -q. So that the conductor's net charge is zero.

But wait, the conductor is uncharged. So when you add +q inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor must have -q, and the outer surface must have +q. So the total conductor's charge remains zero because it was uncharged.

Now, the point P is outside the conductor. So at
