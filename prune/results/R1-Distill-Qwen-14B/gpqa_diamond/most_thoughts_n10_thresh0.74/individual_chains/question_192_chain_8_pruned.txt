Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. Let me try to break it down. Alright, the question is about an uncharged spherical conductor with a cavity inside it. The setup is a bit tricky, but I'll take it step by step.

So, the conductor is a sphere with radius R, and it has a small spherical cavity. The center of the cavity isn't at the same point as the conductor's center. They're separated by a distance s. Also, the radius of the cavity is r, and r is less than R, which makes sense because the cavity is inside the conductor.

Now, a small positive charge +q is placed inside the cavity. The question is asking about the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor. The distance from P to the center of the cavity is l, and both l and L are greater than R. There's also an angle theta between l and s. Hmm, I need to visualize this setup.

Wait, so the point P is outside the conductor, so it's beyond radius R. The conductor was initially uncharged, but when we put the charge +q in the cavity, what happens? I remember that in electrostatics, the charges redistribute themselves based on the situation.

In a conductor, the charges can move freely. But since the conductor was initially uncharged, when we place a charge inside the cavity, the conductor's interior and the cavity's walls will adjust. Oh right, the cavity is inside the conductor, so the charge +q will induce a charge on the inner surface of the conductor.

Wait, the conductor was neutral. If I put +q inside, the inner surface of the conductor (the cavity's wall) must have a charge of -q. Because the conductor as a whole remains neutral. Then, what about the outer surface? Since the conductor is neutral, the outer surface must have a charge of +q to balance the inner -q. Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think again.

Wait, the conductor is neutral. When a charge +q is placed inside the cavity, the cavity's walls (the inner surface) must have an induced charge of -q. Because the conductor's net charge is zero, the outer surface must then have a charge of +q to balance the inner -q and the +q inside.

Wait, no. Wait, the conductor was neutral. The charge inside the cavity is +q. The inner surface of the conductor (the cavity) will have an induced charge of -q, because the charge inside the cavity attracts opposite charges on the conductor's inner wall. Then, since the conductor as a whole is neutral, the outer surface must have a charge of +q to balance the inner -q. Because the total charge of the conductor is zero, so the inner is -q, so the outer is +q.

Wait, no, that can't be right. Let me think again. The conductor is neutral, so its total charge is zero. The charge inside the cavity is +q. The inner surface of the conductor (the part in contact with the cavity) must have an induced charge -q. Because the +q in the cavity will polarize the conductor's material. So the inner surface has -q. Then, the outer surface must have +q because the conductor's total charge is zero. Because the inner has -q, the outer must have +
