Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution. I remember that orthophosphate is PO4^3-.

The solution has 200.00 cm³, which is 0.2 liters. It contains 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O. The molar masses are given as 136.09 g/mol and 177.99 g/mol respectively.

Wait, so the first thing I should do is calculate the moles of each compound. For KH2PO4, moles = mass / molar mass. So 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol. Let me compute that. 1 divided by approximately 136 is about 0.00735 moles. Similarly, for Na2HPO4·2H2O, it's 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol. 1 divided by 178 is about 0.005617 moles.

Wait, but wait. What's the formula of each compound in terms of phosphate species? Let me think. KH2PO4 dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^- (which is H2PO4^-). And Na2HPO4·2H2O, when dissolved, should dissociate into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- ions. Because Na2HPO4 is sodium hydrogen phosphate.

So the solution has H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- ions. But the question is about orthophosphate ions, which are PO4^3-. Hmm, so I might need to think about the phosphate equilibrium here.

Phosphoric acid, H3PO4, can donate three protons. The relevant dissociation steps are:

H3PO4 ↔ H+ + H2PO4^- (Ka1 = 7.5e-3)
H2PO4^- ↔ H+ + HPO4^2- (Ka2 = 6.2e-8)
HPO4^2- ↔ H+ + PO4^3- (Ka3 = 1.8e-12)

Wait, but the solution contains both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-. So it's a buffer situation? Or a mixture of two different buffer systems.

Wait, no, wait. Both KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4 contribute to the phosphate species. So the solution is a mixture of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-. So the phosphate species are H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

But the question is about the concentration of PO4^3- (orthophosphate). Hmm. So I need to find [PO4^3-] in this solution.

Wait, but the problem is that in this solution, the main species are H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-. To get PO4^3-, I think it would only be a small amount because both H2PO4^- and
