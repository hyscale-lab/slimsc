Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because it's about dissolving a hydroxide in an acid. Hmm, let me try to break it down step by step.

The question says we have 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3, and we need to dissolve it in 100 cm³ of solution. We're supposed to find the minimum volume of a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid required. Also, we need to find the pH of the resulting solution.

Alright, first, I think I should figure out how much Fe(OH)3 we have in moles. Molar mass is key here. Let me calculate that. Iron (Fe) has an atomic mass of about 55.85 g/mol, oxygen (O) is 16, and hydrogen (H) is 1. So Fe(OH)3 has one Fe, three O, and three H. Wait, no, wait. Fe(OH)3 is Fe(OH)3, so that's Fe, 3 O, and 3 H. So molar mass is 55.85 + (3*(16 + 1)). Let me compute that: 55.85 + (3*17) = 55.85 + 51 = 106.85 g/mol. So 0.1 grams is how many moles? Moles = mass / molar mass. So 0.1 / 106.85 ≈ 0.000936 moles. Let's say approximately 9.36e-4 mol.

Fe(OH)3 is a weak base, I think. But when we add a strong acid, it should react. The reaction would be: Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ → Fe^3+ + 3H2O. So each mole of Fe(OH)3 needs 3 moles of H+ ions.

So the moles of H+ needed are 3 * 9.36e-4 ≈ 0.002808 mol.

The acid is 0.1 M, so the volume needed can be calculated as moles / concentration. Moles is 0.002808, concentration is 0.1 M. So volume = 0.002808 / 0.1 = 0.02808 liters. Convert to cm³ by multiplying by 1000: 28.08 cm³. But wait, the options don't have exactly this. Let me check the options. Option C says 28.05 cm³. That's close, so maybe that's the volume needed. But wait, is that the minimum volume?

Wait, but the total solution volume is 100 cm³. So when I add the acid to the solution, the total volume might increase or stay around that. But wait, in the problem statement, the total volume is 100 cm³, which I think includes the acid volume. So if I add 28.08 cm³ of acid, the
