Okay, so I've got this question about a textile dye and the light it emits, and I need to figure out what color it absorbs. Hmm, I remember something about light and electrons from my science classes. Let me think.

Wait, the question says the dye has extensively conjugated pi-electrons. Conjugated pi systems mean that the electrons are delocalized over a larger area, right? That usually affects the wavelength of light absorbed. Oh yeah, the energy gap between the HOMO and LUMO levels determines the wavelength of light absorbed.

The energy emitted is given as 2.3393 eV. Wait, but wait—does the energy emitted correspond to the energy absorbed? Or is it the other way around? Because when a compound absorbs light, it gets excited, and then emits light when it relaxes. So the energy of the absorbed photon would be higher, I think. Or maybe it's the same as the emitted? No, probably not. Oh wait, I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, no. The energy of the emitted light is related to the energy difference between the states. So if the dye emits light at 2.3393 eV, that energy corresponds to the energy difference between the excited state and the ground state. So the energy gap is 2.3393 eV. But when the dye absorbs light, it absorbs a photon that has enough energy to excite the electron from the ground state to the excited state. So the absorbed light's energy should be equal to that energy gap, right?

So if the energy is 2.3393 eV, what does that translate to in terms of wavelength? Because the question is about the color of the absorbed light. I remember that energy and wavelength are inversely related via the equation E = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant and c is the speed of light.

Let me calculate the wavelength. E is 2.3393 eV. I think 1 eV is about 1.602 x 10^-19 joules. Wait, but maybe it's easier to use the conversion where 1 eV corresponds to approximately 1240 nm. So wavelength λ = 1240 nm / E(eV). So E is 2.3393 eV.

Calculating that: 1240 divided by 2.3393. Let me do that division. 1240 / 2.3393. Hmm.

Wait, 2.339
