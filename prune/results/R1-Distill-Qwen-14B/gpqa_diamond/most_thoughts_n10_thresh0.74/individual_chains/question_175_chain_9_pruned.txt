Okay, so I've got this physics problem about an oscillating charge distribution and the radiation it produces. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on electromagnetism, but let's see.

The problem says the charge distribution is spheroidal with the symmetry along the z-axis. So, I imagine it's like a prolate spheroid, maybe elongated along the z-axis. Because it's oscillating, it should emit electromagnetic radiation. The question is about the radiated power's dependence on wavelength and angle theta.

The question states that the radiated power per unit solid angle is a function f of lambda and theta. The maximum power is A, and I need to find the fraction of A radiated at theta=30 degrees and the form of f.

Wait, I remember that for a dipole radiator, the radiation pattern isn't isotropic. Dipoles emit more power in certain directions. The radiation from a dipole varies with the cosine of theta, I think. Oh right, the power pattern for a dipole is proportional to (1 + cos^2(theta)) or something like that. Wait, no, wait. Let me think. For a dipole, the radiation is stronger perpendicular to the dipole's axis. So the radiation pattern is maximum at theta=90 degrees, I think. The formula for the radiation intensity (which is power per unit solid angle) is proportional to (1 + cos^2(theta)) or maybe it's (sin^2(theta))... Wait, no. Wait, for a dipole, the radiation pattern is symmetric around the axis, so the maximum occurs at theta=90 degrees. The formula might be proportional to sin^2(theta), but I'm mixing things up.

Wait, no, the dipole's radiation has a maximum at theta = 90 degrees, and it's zero at theta=0 and 180. The formula is something like (sin^2(theta)) * (something). Hmm. Wait, I think the intensity (power per solid angle) for a dipole is proportional to (1 + cos^2(theta)) multiplied by a function of the wavelength and
