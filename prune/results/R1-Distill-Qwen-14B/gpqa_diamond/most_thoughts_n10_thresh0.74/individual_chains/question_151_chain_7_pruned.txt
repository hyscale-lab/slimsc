Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about finding the probability of measuring the observable P to be zero at a given time. Hmm.

Alright, let's see. The state of the system is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, but in quantum mechanics, states are usually represented as vectors, and they need to be normalized, right? So I should check if this vector is normalized.

Wait, the vector components are (-1, 2, 1). The norm (or magnitude) would be the square root of the sum of the squares of each component. Let's calculate that. (-1)^2 is 1, plus 2^2 is 4, plus 1^2 is 1. So 1 +4 +1 =6. The norm is sqrt(6). But in quantum states, the vector should have a norm of 1. So maybe this vector is not normalized. I think the state vector is supposed to be a unit vector. Oh, wait, perhaps I need to normalize it first before proceeding.

Wait, the problem says the state is given by that column matrix. So maybe it's already normalized, but wait  sqrt(6) is about 2.45, so it's not 1. Oh, that's a problem. Because in quantum mechanics, the state vector must have a length of 1; otherwise, probabilities won't add up to 1. So I think I need to normalize the state.

So the state vector is |ψ> = [-1; 2; 1]. The norm is sqrt(6), so the normalized state would be each component divided by sqrt(6). So |ψ> = (1/sqrt(6)) * [-1; 2; 1]. That makes sense because then |a|^2 + |b|^2 + |c|^2 = (1 +4 +1)/6 = 6/6=1.

Wait, but the problem might just give the state as is, regardless of normalization. Hmm, but when calculating probabilities, we usually work with unit vectors. So I think I should normalize it.

Now, the observable is given as matrix P. P is a 3x3 matrix. Let's write down P:

P's first row is [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]
Second row: [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)]
Third row: [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]

Wait, so P is a 3x3 matrix. Observables in quantum mechanics are Hermitian operators because their eigenvalues (the possible measurement outcomes) are real. Let me check if P is Hermitian. For P to be Hermitian, the matrix should equal its conjugate transpose. Let's see:

Looking at the elements:

P[1,2] is 1/sqrt(2), and P[2,1] is 1/sqrt(2) as well. Since they're real, the conjugate doesn't change anything. Similarly, P[2,3] is 1/sqrt(2), and P[3,2] is 1/sqrt(2). So the transpose of P
