Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me about electromagnetic potentials due to a moving point charge. Hmm, I remember that when charges move, they create both electric and magnetic fields. But wait, the question is about the scalar and vector potentials, not the fields directly. So I need to recall how potentials are derived for a moving charge.

The setup says there's a point charge q moving with some trajectory s(t), and we're looking at the fields at a point r at time t. The charge was at a different position at an earlier time tr, and d is the vector from that position to r. The velocity at the field-generating time tr is v.

So I think the scalar potential V and vector potential A are involved here. I remember that for a static charge, the electric potential is V = q/(4πε₀ r), where r is the distance from the charge. But when the charge is moving, things get more complicated because of relativity and the need to consider retarded times and such.

Wait, the problem states that t is greater than tr, so the observation is made after the charge emitted the field. That suggests we're dealing with retarded potentials. Oh right, retarded time is when the position of the charge at an earlier time affects the field at a later time because the effect can't travel faster than light.

So the general expressions for the potentials from a moving charge would have to account for the charge's position and velocity at the retarded time. Let me think about the formulas. The scalar potential V is given by an integral over the charge's history, but in the case of a point charge moving with velocity v, perhaps there's a simpler expression.

I think the scalar potential for a moving charge is similar to the static case but modified by some term involving the velocity. Or maybe not—because the scalar potential is primarily from the electric field, and the vector potential is from the magnetic field. Wait, no, the scalar potential contributes to the electric field, and the vector potential contributes to the magnetic field, but they are both determined by the charge's motion.

Wait, another approach: the potentials can be found using the Liénard potentials. The scalar potential V(r,t) for a moving charge is given by (q/(4πε₀)) * [γ(1 - (v·r̂)/c²)] / r, where γ is the Lorentz factor
