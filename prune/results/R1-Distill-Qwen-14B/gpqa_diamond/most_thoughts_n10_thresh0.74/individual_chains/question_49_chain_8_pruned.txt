Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here about sigmatropic rearrangements. Hmm, I remember that sigmatropic rearrangements involve the shift of a sigma bond along with a pi bond. The Cope and Claisen rearrangements are examples of this, and they are usually thermodynamically controlled. 

The problem has three parts: reactions 1, 2, and 3. I need to figure out what each product would be and then match them to the options given.

Let's take them one by one.

Reaction 1: 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine + but-3-en-2-ol + H+ and heat â†’ A.

Wait, the starting material is 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine. That structure has an amine group attached to a carbon that's also connected to two methoxy groups. So the molecule is like OMe2CH-NH2. Then it's reacting with but-3-en-2-ol, which is CH2CH2CHOHCH2? Wait, no, but-3-en-2-ol is CH2=CHCH(OH)CH3? Wait, no. Wait, but-3-en-2-ol is CH2CH(OH)CH2CH2? No, but wait, but-3-en-2-ol is CH2=CHCH2OH? Wait no, wait. Structure of but-3-en-2-ol: the double bond is between C3 and C4? Wait no, but-3-en-2-ol. The but has four carbons. The double bond between C3 and C4 would be but-3-ene. So, but-3-en-2-ol would be CH2CH(OH)CH2CH3? No, wait. No, but-3-en-2-ol would have the OH on C2. So structure: CH2=CHCH(OH)CH3? Wait, no, that would be but-2-en-3-ol. Wait, maybe I should draw it. The formula for but-3-en-2-ol is CH2CH(OH)CH2CH3? No, but the double bond is from C3 to C4, but but only has four carbons. So but-3-en-2-ol is CH2CH2
