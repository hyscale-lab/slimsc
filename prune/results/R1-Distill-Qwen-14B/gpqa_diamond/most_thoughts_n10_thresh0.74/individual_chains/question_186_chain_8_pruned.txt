Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure out the product of a Cope rearrangement. Hmm, let me think about what I know about the Cope rearrangement.

Wait, the Cope rearrangement is a [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement, right? It typically happens with 1,5-dienes. Oh wait, no, wait. Actually, the Cope rearrangement involves 1,5-dienes rearranging into another diene. Wait, no, another way: the Cope rearrangement usually happens in 1,5-dienes with appropriate substituents. The molecule must have a conjugated diene system that can undergo this rearrangement.

The starting material here is (1S,4R)-2-vinyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene. Hmm, that's a bit of a mouthful. Let me try to visualize the structure.

Bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene means it's a norbornene structure. Norbornene is a bicyclic compound with two rings: a five-membered and a six-membered? Wait, no. Bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane has two bridges. The numbering is such that the bridgeheads are at positions 1 and 4, I think. Oh wait, the parent structure is bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene, so there's a double bond at position 5.

The substituents are 2-v
