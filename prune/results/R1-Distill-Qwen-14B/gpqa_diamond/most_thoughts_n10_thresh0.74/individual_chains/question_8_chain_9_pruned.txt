Okay, so I've got this genetics problem here about plant resistance to a fungal disease called anthracnose. The question involves some gene knockouts and their effects on resistance. Hmm. Let me try to break this down.

So, the setup is that there are three candidate genes: G1, G2, G3. They made knockout mutants for each, and also double mutants. They tested each mutant's resistance to anthracnose. The wild type has 100% resistance, and the mutants have varying percentages.

The data given:
- g1: 75% → so less resistance than wild type. So, without G1, the plant is less resistant. That suggests G1 might be involved in the resistance pathway.
- g2: 0% → no resistance. So without G2, the plant can't resist the pathogen at all. That's a big effect. Maybe G2 is a key gene, perhaps a transcription factor.
- g3: 50% → half the resistance. So G3 contributes but isn't as crucial as G2. Maybe G3 is downstream of another gene, like G2.
  
Now the double mutants:
- g1g3: 10% → very low. So when both G1 and G3 are knocked out, resistance drops way further. Wait, but individually g1 is 75% and g3 is 50%. So when both are out, it's worse than either alone. Hmm, maybe they function in the same pathway and their effects are additive?
- g2g3: 0% → same as g2. So without G2 and G3, the resistance is zero. But since g2 alone is already zero, adding another knockout doesn't change it. So perhaps G3's function is downstream of G2, or maybe G2 is upstream and without it, G3 doesn't matter.
- g1g2: 0% → same as g2. So without G1 and G2, the plant can't resist. But when G2 is knocked out alone, resistance is zero. So maybe G1 is acting in the same pathway as G2, but not downstream.

The question says that at least one gene is a transcription factor acting upstream of others. So likely, the transcription factor is G2 since its knockout is completely resistant. Because if a transcription factor is upstream, it would regulate other genes. So when G2 is knocked out, the downstream genes (like G1 or G3) can't be expressed, leading to no resistance.

Wait, no. The resistance is zero in g2, meaning the plant is more susceptible. So when G2 is working, the plant is resistant. So G2 might be a transcription factor that activates other genes involved in resistance.

Looking at the double mutants:

g2g3: same as g2 (0%). So adding g3 knockout to g2 doesn't change the result. That suggests that G3 is downstream of G2. Because if G2 is a transcription factor that activates G3, then without G2, G3 can't be expressed. So knocking out G3 in a g2 background doesn't make it worse because G3 isn't working anyway.

Similarly, g1g2 is 0%, same as g2. So G1 might be downstream of G2. Or perhaps G1 is downstream of another gene, but when G2 is gone, G1 is not expressed either.

Wait, but in the g1 mutant, resistance is 75%. So G1's presence is helpful, but not as much as G2. So perhaps G1 is downstream of G2. Because without G2, G1 isn't expressed, but in the g1 knockout, G2 is present but G1 isn't, leading to lower resistance.

Wait, but in the double mutant g1g3: 10% resistance. So without G1 and G3, it's worse than either
