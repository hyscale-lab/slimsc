Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Hmm, let's see what the question is. It's about a series of reactions starting with cyclohexanone. I'll need to track each reaction and see what product is formed each time. Then, finally, determine how many chemically distinct hydrogen atoms are in product 4.

Alright, let's start breaking down each step. The first step is cyclohexanone being treated with bromine (Br2) to form product 1. I remember that when ketones like cyclohexanone react with bromine, it's typically an addition reaction. But wait, where does the bromine add? I think when a ketone has a hydrogen alpha to the carbonyl group, bromine can add via a mechanism called the benzoin condensation, but wait, no, that's with aldehydes and different conditions. Oh, wait, another possibility: cyclohexanone under certain conditions can undergo an addition of bromine, but more likely, maybe it's a diaddition. Alternatively, perhaps it's a pinacol rearrangement, but that requires a base, maybe. Or wait, maybe it's a conjugate addition, but cyclohexanone doesn't have a conjugated system. Hmm, maybe I'm confusing something else. Oh wait, another option: cyclohexanone can undergo a bromohydrin formation. Wait, but that usually involves water and HBr. Alternatively, maybe it's a bromination via enol formation. Oh, wait, bromine can add to the double bond if the ketone is in a conjugated diene system, but cyclohexanone doesn't have a double bond. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.

Wait, I think when cyclohexanone is treated with bromine, it undergoes a halohydrin formation. Wait, but for that, you usually have a base, like NaOH. Alternatively, maybe it's an enolate formation. No, wait, perhaps it's an addition of bromine to the carbonyl, but that's not possible because the carbonyl is electrophilic and bromine is a dienophile. Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Another thought: perhaps it's a diaddition, like the cyclohexanone ring adding two bromines across the carbonyl, but that doesn't make sense because the carbonyl is a ketone, not an alkene. Oh wait, maybe it's a bromine addition to a conjugated system, but cyclohexanone isn
