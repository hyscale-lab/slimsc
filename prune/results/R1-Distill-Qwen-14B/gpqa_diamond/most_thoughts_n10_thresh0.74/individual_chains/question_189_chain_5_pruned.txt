Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about particles and spontaneous symmetry breaking. Hmm, I remember that spontaneous symmetry breaking is when the underlying laws have a certain symmetry, but the system as a whole doesn't exhibit that symmetry because it's in a particular state. Like how a spinning top has rotational symmetry, but when it falls over, the symmetry is broken.

The question is asking which particle isn't associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry. The options are A) Phonon, B) Skyrmion, C) Magnon, D) Pion.

Wait, let's think about each option. 

Pions are particles associated with the breaking of chiral symmetry in quantum chromodynamics (QCD). Chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken at low energies, and pions are the Goldstone bosons of that symmetry breaking. So D) Pion is definitely associated with broken symmetry.

Magnons are quantized spin waves in magnetic materials. They arise from the quantization of magnetic spin fluctuations. In ferromagnetism, when the material has a preferred magnetization direction, the continuous rotational symmetry of the spins is broken to a discrete symmetry. Magnons are the Goldstone modes here, so they're tied to broken symmetry. So C) Magnon is associated with broken symmetry.

Skyrmions are a type of topological soliton solution in certain field theories, like in the context of pion physics. They were proposed by Skyrme to describe nucleons as topological objects. Skyrmions are related to the pion field configurations and emerge from the broken chiral symmetry in QCD. So B) Skyrmion is linked to broken symmetry.

Phonons are quantized sound waves in solids. They arise from the quantization of vibrations in a crystal lattice. When a crystal is in a disordered phase, like a liquid, phonons aren't really a thing, but in a solid, they represent the vibrational modes. Wait, but do phonons come from spontaneous symmetry breaking?

Wait, in the context of solids, the phonon arises from the lattice vibrations. The underlying laws have translational symmetry, but the solid breaks that symmetry by forming a periodic lattice. So the phonon is a mode of vibration in the ordered state, which is a result of the broken translational symmetry. Alternatively, in the theory of superconductivity, like the BCS theory, the phonon plays a role in Cooper pairing, but I'm not sure if that's relevant here.

Wait, another angle: in the context of spontaneous symmetry breaking, phonons are a result of the breaking of translational symmetry in the solid state. So when a solid forms a crystal, the translational symmetry is broken (to a discrete symmetry) and phonons are the Goldstone modes for that breaking. So phonons are associated with spontaneously broken symmetry.

Wait, but wait. The original spontaneous symmetry breaking in particle physics is about continuous symmetries being broken, leading to massless Goldstone bosons. Phonons are massless (in the long wavelength limit) and are the Goldstone bosons for the broken translational symmetry. So yes, phonons are from a broken symmetry.

So if all the options A-D are particles associated with broken symmetry, then the question must have one that isn't. Wait, the question says which is NOT associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry.

Wait, wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think again.

Wait, for phonons: The symmetry being broken here is the translational symmetry.
