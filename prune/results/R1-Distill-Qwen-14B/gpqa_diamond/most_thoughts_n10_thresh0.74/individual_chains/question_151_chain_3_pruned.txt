Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to figure it out. Let's see what the question is asking.

The state of the system at time t is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, but in quantum mechanics, states are supposed to be normalized, right? Oh wait, maybe I should check if this is a normalized vector first. The components are -1, 2, 1. To find the norm, I square each component and add them. So (-1)^2 is 1, 2^2 is 4, 1^2 is 1. Adding them up, 1 +4 +1 =6. So the norm is sqrt(6). Hmm, that means the state vector isn't normalized. So I think I should normalize it before proceeding. Because in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are unit vectors.

So the state is not normalized. So the first step is to normalize it. So the normalized state would be each component divided by sqrt(6). So the state vector becomes ( -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) )^T.

Next, the observable is given by the matrix P. Let me write down the matrix P. The first row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0), second row is (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), and the third row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). So matrix P is:

[ 0        1/√2      0 ]
[1/√2      0       1/√2 ]
[ 0        1/√2     0 ]

Wait, to find the probability of getting a particular outcome when measuring P, I think we need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of P. Because in quantum mechanics, when you measure an observable, the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues of the operator, and the probability is the square of the amplitude of the eigenvector corresponding to that eigenvalue in the state.

So the question is asking the probability of getting 0 when measuring P. So I need to find what are the eigenvalues of P, see which eigenvalue is zero, and then find the projection of the state onto the corresponding eigenvector.

Wait, but maybe P is a projection operator.
