Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to work through it step by step. The question is about a particle in a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator potential. Hmm, I remember that in such a system, the potential is V(r) = (1/2) m ω² r². Oh right, that's a harmonic oscillator, and it's isotropic, meaning it's the same in all directions. 

The question asks for the energy of the third excited state and how many linearly independent eigenfunctions have the same energy. So, I need to find the energy level and the degeneracy.

Wait, in a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are given by a specific formula. Let me think. Oh yeah, the energy levels are quantized and depend on the quantum numbers in each of the three dimensions. Since it's isotropic, the potential is symmetric in all directions, so I can treat each direction (x, y, z) as a 1D harmonic oscillator.

In three dimensions, the energy is often expressed in terms of the principal quantum number n, but wait, sometimes it's expressed using the sum of the quantum numbers. For a 3D isotropic HO, the energy is E = (n + 3/2) ħω, where n is a non-negative integer. Wait, no, wait another way: each direction has its own quantum number, say nx, ny, nz, all non-negative integers. Then the total energy is E = (nx + ny + nz + 3/2) ħω. So the energy depends on the sum of the individual quantum numbers.

But the problem is about the third excited state. Wait, excited states are states with higher energy than the ground state. So the ground state is the lowest energy, which is (3/2) ħω, right? Then each excited state increases the energy by ħω increments. 

Wait, but in terms of the principal quantum number in 3D, it's a bit different. Oh, because in 3D, the energy levels are degenerate. So the energy levels are given by E = (n + 3/2) ħω, where n is the sum of the individual quantum numbers in each direction: n = nx + ny + nz. So for each state, n is the sum. 

Now, the ground state is
