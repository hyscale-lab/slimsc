Okay, so I have this question about radioactive decay, and I'm a bit rusty on the concepts, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the problem again.

The question says that an atom has a 32% chance of decaying within 100 minutes. So far, 50 minutes have passed, and the atom hasn't decayed. Now they ask what's the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes. Hmm.

Wait, radioactive decay is a Poisson process, right? And it's based on the concept of a half-life, I think. But wait, 32% in 100 minutes. Oh, wait, 32% is the probability that the atom decays within that time. So that suggests that the decay follows an exponential decay model.

So the probability that the atom hasn't decayed after time t is given by P(t) = e^(-λt), where λ is the decay constant. But wait, the given probability is 32% decayed within 100 minutes. So the probability of not decaying in 100 minutes is 68% (100-32). So that 68% is e^(-λ * 100) = 0.68.

So I can find λ from that. Let me calculate λ. Take natural log on both sides: ln(0.68) = -λ *100. So λ = -ln(0.68)/100.

Calculating ln(0.68). I remember ln(1) is 0, ln(0.5) is about -0.693. Let me think, 0.68 is a bit higher than 0.5, so ln(0.68) should be around what? Maybe approximately -0.4. Let me check more accurately.

Using calculator (even though I don't have one, but I remember some key values). ln(0.68) ≈ -0.4005. Let me double-check that. Hmm, yeah, because e^-0.4 is about 0.6703, which is close to 0.68. So λ ≈ 0.4005 / 100 = 0.004005 per minute.

Wait, but another way: because the decay formula is N(t) = N0 e^(-λ t
