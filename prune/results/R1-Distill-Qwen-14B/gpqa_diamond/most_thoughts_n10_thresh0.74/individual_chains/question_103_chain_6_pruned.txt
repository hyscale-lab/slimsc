Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here. It's about synthesizing a specific compound starting from benzene. The target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. Hmm, let me break that down.

First, the target structure: it's a phenyl group substituted with two groups—bromo and nitro. The ethanone part is attached to the carbon where these substituents are. Wait, no, wait. Ethan-1-one is (CH3)CO attached to the benzene ring. So the substituents are on the benzene ring, and the ketone is directly attached as a substituent.

Wait, benzene rings can have substituents in specific positions based on the synthesis steps. The substituents here are at 3 and 5 positions relative to the ketone group. So the ketone is at position 1, bromo at 3, and nitro at 5. So the substituents are meta to each other, but that depends on how the groups are added.

Now, the starting material is benzene. So I need to figure out the sequence of reactions that would introduce the substituents in the correct positions.

Let me think about the possible steps. The target has a ketone group (ethan-1-one), which suggests that maybe an acylation reaction was involved. The substituents are nitro and bromo groups. Nitro groups are usually introduced via nitration, and bromine via bromination.

But the problem is the order in which these groups are introduced because each substituent directs the next substitution in a certain way. Nitro groups are meta directors, and bromine can be ortho/para if it's a substituent on the ring.

Wait, but wait—that's when you're adding substituents after the ring already has some groups. So the sequence of adding these groups would influence where the next substituent goes.

So let me think about the plan. The target molecule has a ketone group, a bromine, and a nitro group on the benzene ring.

Ethanone is an acetyl group (O=C-CH3 attached to the benzene). So one of the steps must be Friedel-Crafts acylation, which uses something like CH3COCl with AlCl3 as a catalyst. So that's step iii in some options.

But when you perform Friedel-Crafts, you need activating groups. Benzene is not very reactive, so you need to activate it. Wait, but benzene isn't activated, so Friedel-Crafts would need a directing group. Oh wait, but if you have substituents that are activating, you can do FC acylation. But nitro is a deactivating group, which is meta directing. So if you have a nitro group already, it would influence where the acylation happens.

Wait, but for Friedel-Crafts, the ring must be activated. Because FC reactions are electrophilic substitutions, and benzene isn't activated enough. So the presence of activating groups (like -OCH3, -NH2, etc.) would help. But nitro groups are deactivating, so maybe that's a problem.

Wait, maybe the order is important here. Let me think: if I start with benzene, perhaps first nitrate it to introduce the nitro group. Nitration is done with HNO3 and H2SO4. Then, after that, if I try to do a FC acylation, but nitro is deactivating, which would make FC acylation difficult. Because FC needs an activating group.

Hmm, that's a problem. So maybe we need to acylate first, then nitrate and brominate. Because if I have an acyl group (like methyl ketone), that's a meta director. Acyl groups are meta directors. So after acylation, when I nitrate, the nitro group would go into the meta position relative to the acyl group.

Wait, but the target structure has the nitro at position 5 and bromo at 3. Wait, let me think about the numbering. Let's imagine the benzene ring with the acetyl group at position 1. Then, positions 3 and 5 would be adjacent—so that would
