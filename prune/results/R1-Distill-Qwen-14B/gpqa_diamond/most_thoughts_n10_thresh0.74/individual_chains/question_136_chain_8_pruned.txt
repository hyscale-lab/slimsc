Okay, so I've got this vector calculus problem here. Hmm, let's see. The question is about evaluating the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field inside a sphere. The vector field f(r) has a magnitude of 1/r² and it's only along the radial direction in spherical coordinates. Oh wait, and it falls off as 1/r² from the origin.

Right, I remember that divergence is a measure of a vector field's source or sink at a given point. So the divergence of f would tell me something about how the field behaves inside the sphere.

Wait, the field is radial, so f(r) = (1/r²) r̂, right? Because in spherical coordinates, the unit vector is r̂. So it's only in the radial direction.

I think I need to compute the divergence of f. The divergence in spherical coordinates for a vector field that only has a radial component is (1/r²) d/dr (r² f_r). Since f_r is 1/r², let me plug that in.

So f_r = 1/r². So the divergence ∇ · f would be (1/r²) d/dr (r² * (1/r²)) ). Let's compute that.

Inside the derivative, r² * (1/r²) is just 1. So d/dr (1) is zero. So the divergence is zero everywhere except maybe at the origin, because at r=0, things might blow up. Wait, but the origin is a point, so does that affect the integral?

The integral in question is the volume integral of ∇ ·
