Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

Alright, the problem says that a spin-half particle is in a linear superposition: 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. And I need to find the expectation value of the operator 10σz +5σx. The options are given, so I think I can calculate it and pick the correct one.

Hmm, expectation values. I remember that the expectation value of an operator is like the average outcome if you measured that observable many times on the same state. So for an operator A, it's ⟨ψ|A|ψ⟩.

The operator here is 10σz plus 5σx. So I can probably split this into two parts: the expectation of 10σz and the expectation of 5σx, then add them together.

But wait, maybe I should factor out the constants. So the expectation value of 10σz would be 10 times the expectation of σz, and similarly 5 times the expectation of σx. So overall, it's 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩.

Right, so I need to compute ⟨σz⟩ and ⟨σx⟩ for the given state.

First, let me write down the state. The state is |ψ⟩ = 0.5|↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↓⟩. Wait, let me check the coefficients. 0.5 squared plus (sqrt(3)/2)^2 is 0.25 + (3/4) = 1. So yes, it's normalized. Good.

σz is the Pauli z matrix. Its eigenstates are |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ with eigenvalues +1 and -1 respectively. Oh wait, wait! Wait, no: I think σz |↑⟩ = +|↑⟩, and σz |↓⟩ = -|↓⟩. So the eigenvalues are +1 and -1.

So for the expectation of σz, since |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates, it's straightforward. The expectation value is |a|^2 * (+1) + |b|^2 * (-1), where a and b are the coefficients of |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ respectively.

Wait, looking back, the state is 0.5 |↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2) |↓⟩. So a is 0.5, b is sqrt(3)/2.

So |a|^2 is (0.5)^2 = 0.25, and |b|^2 is (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = 3/4 = 0.75.

So ⟨σz⟩ = 0.25*(1) + 0.75*(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5.

Then the expectation for 10σz is 10 * (-0.5) = -5.

Now the second part: the expectation
