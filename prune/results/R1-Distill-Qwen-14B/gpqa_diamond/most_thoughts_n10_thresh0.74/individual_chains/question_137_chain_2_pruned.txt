Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a synchrocyclotron. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it. So the question is about how many revolutions a proton makes in the synchrocyclotron. 

Alright, the problem says a proton is injected at t=0 with negligible kinetic energy, so T is about 0. It undergoes two accelerations to reach T1 = 950 MeV. The voltage applied is U(t) = U0 cos[2πν(α)t + Φ0], where Φ0 is π/4 and U0 is 190 kV. 

Wait, I remember that in cyclotrons, the particles move in a magnetic field and are accelerated by an electric field. The key here is figuring out how the energy relates to the number of revolutions. 

So, the kinetic energy gained by the proton is related to the voltage. Since each acceleration by the electric field gives a certain energy boost. For a cyclotron, the energy gained per revolution is equal to the voltage of the applied electric field. Oh wait, but in a synchrocyclotron, the frequency changes as the particle gains energy, right? Because the speed increases, so the cyclotron frequency ν changes. 

Wait, but the formula for the kinetic energy T of the proton. Each time it goes around, it gets a 'kick' of energy equal to the voltage. So for each revolution, it gains U0. But wait, how? Because the potential difference U(t) is applied, and each time the proton goes through the gap, it gains energy equal to the peak voltage U0. Oh wait, but the voltage is given as U0 cos(...), so the maximum voltage is U0. So each cycle, the proton gets a maximum energy of U0 * e, where e is the charge. 

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. The particle is accelerated each time it passes through the gap. In a cyclotron, each time it goes through the gap between the dees, it gets a voltage kick. So the energy gained per revolution is e * U0, assuming the maximum voltage. Because the voltage is sinusoidal, but the maximum is U0. 

So, the total energy T is approximately e * U0 * N, where N is the number of revolutions. Because each revolution adds e U0. 

But wait, in reality, the cyclotron frequency changes as the particle's speed
