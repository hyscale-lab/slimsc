Okay, so I've got this problem about crystallography, and I'm a bit rusty on my interplanar distances. Let me think through this step by step. The question is about a rhombohedral crystal. 

Rhombohedral crystals... wait, aren't they a type of hexagonal crystal system? Or is it a subclass of cubic? Hmm, no, wait, rhombohedral is part of the hexagonal system, right? Or maybe I'm mixing things up. Oh wait, no, actually, rhombohedral is its own category. Let me recall: the seven crystal systems include cubic, hexagonal, tetragonal, orthorhombic, monoclinic, triclinic, and rhombohedral. Rhombohedral is where all the edges are equal, and all angles are the same. So in this case, the angles alpha, beta, gamma are all 30 degrees, and the interatomic distance (a) is 10 Angstroms. 

The question is asking for the interplanar distance of the (111) plane. I remember that interplanar distances are calculated using the structure factor or something with the Miller indices. Right, the formula for interplanar distance d(hkl) is given by:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - (hk cos α + hl cos β + kl cos γ) )

Wait, no, perhaps I should think about the general formula for interplanar spacing in a crystal lattice. Oh right, the formula is:

d = \frac{a}{\sqrt{h^2 + k^2 + l^2 - 2(hk \cos\gamma) - 2(hl \cos\beta) - 2(kl \cos\alpha)}}

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me get the exact formula right. Oh wait, no, the correct formula for interplanar distance in a crystal with lattice parameters a, b, c and angles α, β, γ is more complicated. But in a rhombohedral crystal, a = b = c, and all angles are equal, so that might simplify the formula.

Wait, in a rhombohedral system, all the lattice parameters a, b, c are equal, and the angles between them are all the same, which in this case is 30 degrees. So the formula for interplanar distance might simplify because a=b=c and α=β=γ
