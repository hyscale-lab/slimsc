Alright, I've got this physics problem here about comparing the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy of a hydrogen atom. Hmm, let me think through it step by step.

Okay, the question says the magnetic field B is parallel to the Oz axis. Oh wait, Oz is the z-axis, so the field is along that. The value of m is small, which I remember is the orbital magnetic quantum number. So m can be 0, ±1, etc., but the problem says small, so maybe m is like 0 or ±1.

The main thing is to compare the paramagnetic coupling term ⟨H⟩ with the transition energy ΔE. The transition energy corresponds to a wavelength of 0.4861 micrometers. Wait, that's the Balmer series in hydrogen, right? Because the Balmer-alpha line is around 0.486 micrometers. So ΔE would be the energy difference between the n=2 and n=1 levels in hydrogen.

First, I need to find the expressions for both terms.

The paramagnetic coupling term, I think, comes from the interaction between the magnetic moment of the electron and the external magnetic field. The energy of this interaction is given by the Zeeman effect. The Hamiltonian for the Zeeman effect is something like H = -μ·B, where μ is the magnetic moment.

The magnetic moment μ is related to the angular momentum L. Oh wait, the orbital magnetic moment μ_L is given by μ_L = (eħ)/(2m_e) * (L), or something like that. Wait, the formula I remember is μ = -g_L * μ_B * L, where g_L is the Landé g-factor for orbital angular momentum. But for electrons, I think the g-factor is approximately 1 for orbital and 2 for spin, but maybe in the paramagnetic case, it's considering the orbital contribution. Wait, but in this problem, I'm not sure if it's orbital or spin. Hmm.

Wait, the question says "paramagnetic coupling term", which suggests it's the interaction due to the orbital motion. Or wait, paramagnetism is usually due to the electron's spin, isn't it? Oh wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. Paramagnetism arises from the spin magnetic moments, while the Zeeman effect is about the orbital contribution. Or wait, no: in the Zeeman effect, it's the orbital angular momentum that interacts, and in the Paschen-
