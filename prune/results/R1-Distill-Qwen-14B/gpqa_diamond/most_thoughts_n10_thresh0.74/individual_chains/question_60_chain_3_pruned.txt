Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again.

So, the question is about an alien spacecraft traveling at a very high speed towards Earth. The astronaut is 22 years old, and we need to find out how long the trip will take from their perspective. The options are whether they'll die before reaching Earth or some number of years. Hmm.

Wait, the problem says the spacecraft is traveling at 0.99999987 times the speed of light. That's super close to the speed of light. I remember that when objects move at speeds very close to c, relativistic effects become significant. Oh right, time dilation and length contraction come into play here.

So the astronaut's perspective is important here. The question is asking for the time experienced by the astronaut, which is the proper time. Proper time is the time measured in the moving frame, right? So I need to calculate the proper time for the journey.

Wait, but wait. I think I should figure out the distance first. The Large Magellanic Cloud is a satellite galaxy of the Milky Way. I'm not exactly sure of its distance from Earth, but perhaps I don't need the exact value. Let me think. Maybe the problem expects me to calculate using the speed given and some standard distance, but wait, the problem doesn't provide the distance. Hmm, perhaps I'm supposed to calculate the distance in terms of light-years and then use that.

Wait, I think the Large Magellanic Cloud is about 160,000 light-years away. Wait, is that right? I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact figure, but I think it's around 160,000 or 170,000 light-years. Let's go with 163,000 light-years as an approximate figure.

Wait, but wait, the problem might not require that. Because the problem states that the average lifetime of these aliens is about 150 solar years. Oh, but the astronaut is 22 years old, so perhaps they might not live that long. But wait, the question is about the time experienced by the astronaut, so maybe whether they survive the trip depends on the time experienced.

Wait, the astronaut is 22, and the average lifetime is 150 years, so if the trip takes more than, say, 128 years (150-22=128), then the astronaut would die before reaching Earth. So if the time experienced is longer than about 128 years, the answer would be A. But if it's less, then it's one of the other options.

But how do I calculate the proper time experienced by the astronaut?

Right, the proper time τ (tau) is given by the equation:

τ = T * sqrt(1 - v²/c²)

Wait, no. Wait, actually, the proper time is the time measured in the moving frame, so for the astronaut, the time is less than the time measured in Earth's frame. Because from Earth's perspective, the spaceship is moving, so the distance is contracted.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the Earth's frame first. How long does it take from Earth's perspective?

The distance is D. The speed is v=0.99999987*c.

So time T = D / v.

If D is 163,000 light-years, then:

T = 163,000 ly / 0.99999987 c.

Wait, since 1 ly is the distance light travels in one year, and v is in terms of c, then the time in Earth's frame is (D / (v*c)) * (ly / c) ) ?

Wait, maybe it's better to express D in terms of light-years. Let me think again.

Let me compute T, the time from Earth's frame.

T = D / v. Because v is a fraction of c, D is in light-years, so T would be in years.

Wait, D is 163,000 light-years, and v is approximately 0.9999
