Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I remember that when dealing with speeds close to the speed of light, I can't just use classical mechanics because of the relativity effects. Let me think about what formulas I should use.

The problem states that the two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c, respectively, both in the positive x-direction. So, first, I think I need to find the relative speed between them. Wait, relative speed in relativity isn't as simple as subtracting the two speeds, right? Because of the velocity addition formula.

Right, the formula for relative velocity in special relativity is (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/c²). But wait, which one is u and which is v? So if astronaut A is moving at 0.6c and astronaut B at 0.5c, from A's frame, what speed is B moving? Or from B's frame, what speed is A moving? Oh wait, wait, the problem asks for the relative speed between them, so it shouldn't matter which way we calculate because speed is a scalar, but relative velocity is direction-dependent. Oh wait, no, velocity is a vector, so the relative velocity would be the same in magnitude whether you consider A from B or B from A, but I think I should be careful here.

Wait, wait, wait. Let me think: if both are moving in the same direction, then the relative speed isn't just the difference because of the relativistic effects. So, if astronaut A is moving at 0.6c and astronaut B at 0.5c, from the perspective of A, B is moving at (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c² ). Let me calculate that denominator first. 0.6*0.5 is 0.3, so 0.3c². Divided by c² is 0.3. So denominator is 1 - 0.3 = 0.7.

Then the numerator is 0.1c. So 0.1c / 0.7 = (0.1/0.7)c ≈ 0.142857c. So approximately 0.14c. That makes sense. So the relative speed is about 0.14c. So looking at the options, options C and D have v_rel = 0.14c. So that's a start.

Next, the total energy of the system. I think I need to calculate the total relativistic energy for each astronaut and add them together. The formula for relativistic energy is E = gamma * m c². Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

First, for astronaut A with mass 2m and speed 0.6c. Gamma for A: 1/sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25. So E_A = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².
