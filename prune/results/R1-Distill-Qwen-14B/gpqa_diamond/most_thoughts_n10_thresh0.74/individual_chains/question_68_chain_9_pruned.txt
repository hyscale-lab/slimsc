Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem about spin-1/2 particles and magnetic moments. Hmm, let me try to parse it out step by step. 

The setup is that there's a spin 1/2 particle with a magnetic moment mu, which is given as gamma times Sz. So mu = γ S_z. The magnetic field initially points in the +Z direction. Then, suddenly, the magnetic field is turned off and another one is turned on along the +Y direction, and both fields have the same magnitude B. 

The question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment. Wait, average oscillation? So they're looking for the frequency at which the expectation value of S_z changes over time.

I remember that in such scenarios, the system's state doesn't change instantaneously when the Hamiltonian changes. So when the magnetic field switches from Z to Y, the state of the particle remains the same, but the Hamiltonian changes. This probably leads to time evolution under the new Hamiltonian, which could result in oscillations in expectation values.

The initial state must be an eigenstate of the initial Hamiltonian. The initial magnetic field is along +Z, so the Hamiltonian before the change is H_initial = -μ·B. Since mu is γ S_z, H_initial becomes proportional to S_z. So the eigenstates are the spin-up and spin-down states along Z.

After the field is turned off and the Y field is turned on, the new Hamiltonian is H_final = -μ·B'. Wait, the direction changed, but magnitude B same. So B is along Y now. So H_final = -μ · B_y, which is -γ S_y * B, because mu is γ S_z but wait, wait no. Wait, mu is the magnetic moment, which is typically mu = γ S, where S is the spin operator. Wait, no, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. 

The magnetic moment is usually given by mu = γ S, where γ is the gyromagnetic ratio. But in this problem, it's given as mu = γ S_z. So wait, that doesn't sound right. Oh wait, perhaps it's that the magnetic moment is proportional to the component along the field direction. Or is it the vector? Because in general, the magnetic moment is a vector, and the energy is -mu·B. So if the field is along Z, mu_z contributes. So perhaps the given mu is the z-component of the magnetic moment, which is γ S_z. Or maybe the entire magnetic moment vector is γ S. Hmm, need to clarify.

Wait, the problem says mu = γ S_z, so the magnetic moment is only in the z direction. But when the field is applied along Y, the magnetic moment would interact with the Y component. Wait, but if mu is only in the z-direction, then mu · B would be zero when B is along Y. Because mu is a vector in z, B is in y. So their dot product is zero, so the energy would be zero. That can't be right because then the particle's state wouldn't evolve under the new Hamiltonian. But the question says the average of the z-component starts oscillating, which suggests that the expectation value changes over time.

Hmm, maybe I misread the problem. Let me go back. The magnetic moment is mu = gamma * S_z. So mu is in the z-direction. The magnetic field is applied along Y. So the interaction would be mu · B. Since mu is along z and B is along y, the dot product is zero. So the energy is zero? That can't be right.

Wait, wait, perhaps mu is the vector itself, so mu = gamma * S. So the magnetic moment is a vector, with components mu_x, mu_y, mu_z, each being gamma times S_x, etc. That makes more sense because then when the field is applied along Y, the energy would be -mu · B = -gamma B (S_y). So H_final = -gamma B S_y. 

Ah, that makes more sense. So probably, the initial statement should have been mu = gamma * S, not gamma * S_z. Because otherwise, the problem wouldn't make sense. But given that the problem says mu = gamma S_z, I'm a bit confused. Let me proceed with that.

Wait, perhaps the magnetic moment is mu = gamma * S, but in the problem statement, it's written as mu = gamma S_z. Hmm. Maybe the problem is using a simplified notation where mu is only in the z-direction, but that would complicate the situation when the magnetic field is applied along Y. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the magnetic moment is mu = gamma * S, and the alignment is along a certain direction. So when B is along Z, the magnetic moment is along Z, so mu is in Z direction. When the field is turned along Y, then mu would have components in Y and Z? No, wait, that's not correct. The magnetic moment is a vector quantity that determines the energy as mu · B. So if the spin is in a state with definite S_z, then mu would be along z, but after the field changes, the Hamiltonian would involve S_y. 

But I'm getting stuck on the exact form of mu. Let's assume that mu is gamma times the spin operator, which is a vector. So mu = γ S, where S is the vector (S_x, S_y, S_z). Then, the initial Hamiltonian is H_initial = -mu · B_initial = -gamma B S_z. So the initial state is an eigenstate of S_z. 

When the field is turned off and the new field is applied along Y, the new Hamiltonian is H_final = -mu · B_final = -gamma B S_y. So the Hamiltonian becomes proportional to S_y. 

So the system was initially in an eigenstate of S_z. Now, the Hamiltonian is H = - gamma B S_y. The time evolution will be determined by this H. 

The time-dependent expectation value <S_z> will oscillate because the state will precess around the Y-axis. The frequency of oscillation is determined by the energy levels' splitting, which comes from the Hamiltonian.

Since the particle is spin-1/2, the eigenvalues of S_y are ± ħ/2. So the energy levels are E_+ = -gamma B (ħ/2), and E_- = gamma B (ħ/2). Because H = -gamma B S_y, so E = -gamma B (S_y eigenvalues). Wait, S_y has eigenvalues ± ħ/2, so E_+ = -gamma B (ħ/2), E_- = gamma B (ħ/2).

The energy difference between these two levels is (E_+ - E_-) = (-gamma B (ħ/2)) - (gamma B (ħ/2)) )= -gamma B ħ. Wait, no, because E_+ is -gamma B (ħ/2), E_- is gamma B (ħ/2). So difference is E_+ - E_- = (-gamma B ħ/2) - (gamma B ħ/2) ) = -gamma B ħ. But when you take the absolute value, it's gamma B ħ.

The frequency of oscillation between the states is given by the energy difference divided by h-bar. So frequency ν = (ΔE) / ħ. So ΔE is 2 gamma B (ħ/2)*2? Wait, wait, let's calculate it properly. The energy levels are E_+ = (-gamma B) (ħ/2) and E_- = (gamma B) (ħ/2). Because S_y has eigenvalues ± ħ/2. So E_+ is (-gamma B)(+ħ/2) and E_- is (-gamma B)(-ħ/2) = gamma B (ħ/2). So the difference between E_+ and E_- is (E_- - E_+) = [gamma B ħ/2] - [ - gamma B ħ/2 ] = gamma B ħ/2 + gamma B ħ/2 = gamma B ħ.

So ΔE = gamma B ħ. Then the frequency is ΔE / ħ = gamma B. So the oscillation frequency is gamma B. 

But wait, the question is about the average of the z-component of the moment. The spin z-component's expectation value oscillates due to the time
