Alright, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I remember that mesons are subatomic particles, right? And resonance has to do with their unstable states. Okay, the question is asking about the mean decay distance. 

The given parameters are production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. I think I need to use some formula related to particle decay lengths. 

Wait, I remember that the mean lifetime of a particle is related to its width. The formula is τ = ħ / Γ. Oh wait, but that's when the width is the total decay width. Oh right, yes, because the width Γ is related to the inverse lifetime.

But wait, the mean decay distance would be the lifetime multiplied by the velocity of the particle. Because distance is velocity multiplied by time. So, the formula should be something like: decay length L = v * τ = v * ħ / Γ.

But wait, I think I might have this mixed up. Also, the production energy probably affects the velocity. So how do I calculate the velocity?

Let me think. The energy of the particle is given as E_X = 8 GeV. But the mass is m_X = 1.2 GeV. So the total energy is much higher than the rest mass. That means the particle is moving at a relativistic speed.

I can use the relativistic energy formula: E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c
