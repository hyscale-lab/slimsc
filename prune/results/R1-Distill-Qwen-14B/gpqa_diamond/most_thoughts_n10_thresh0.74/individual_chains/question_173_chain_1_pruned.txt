Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the uncertainty principle. Hmm, the question is about finding the minimum uncertainty in the energy of an electron given its uncertainty in position. Let me think through how to approach this.

First, I remember that the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle relates the uncertainty in position (Δx) and the uncertainty in momentum (Δp). The formula is Δx * Δp ≥ ℏ/2, where ℏ is the reduced Planck's constant. So, I can use that to find Δp.

Wait, but the question asks for the uncertainty in energy, not momentum. Oh right, because energy and momentum are related, especially for particles moving at speeds much less than the speed of light. The kinetic energy (K.E.) is given by (p²)/(2m), where p is momentum and m is mass. So if I can find Δp, I can relate it to ΔE.

Let me jot down the steps:

1. Calculate Δp using the uncertainty principle.
2. Use the momentum-energy relation to find ΔE.

Starting with the uncertainty principle: Δx * Δp ≈ ℏ/2. We can rearrange this to find Δp ≈ ℏ/(2Δx). 

Wait, but sometimes people ignore the 2 for order of magnitude, so maybe I can approximate Δp ≈ ℏ/Δx. Since the question is asking for an estimate, perhaps the factor of 2 isn't crucial here.

So ℏ is the reduced Planck's constant, which is approximately 1.0545718 × 10^-34 J·s. The given Δx is 0.1 nm, which is 0.1 × 10^-9 meters, or 1e-10 meters.

Plugging in the numbers: Δp ≈ (1.05e-34 J·s) / (1e-10 m) = 1.05e-24 kg·m/s.

Wait, because 1e-34 divided by 1e-10 is 1e-24. Right. So Δp is about 1e-24 kg·m/s.

Now, to find ΔE. The kinetic energy is (p²)/(2m), but wait, how does the uncertainty in momentum relate to the uncertainty in energy? Oh, I think the uncertainty in energy would be the derivative of energy with respect to momentum multiplied by Δp. Or perhaps it's just the uncertainty in the kinetic energy, which would be (p²)/(2m), so ΔE would be approximately ( (Δp)^2 )/(2m). Because the derivative of (p²)/(2m) with respect to p is p/m, so ΔE ≈ (Δp)(p/m). Wait, but without knowing p exactly, maybe I can just take ΔE as (Δp)^2/(2m). Because if you have a small Δp, the change in energy is quadratic in Δp.

Alternatively, since the energy is proportional to p squared, the uncertainty in energy would be proportional to (Δp)^2. Let's proceed with that approach.

So, m is the mass of the electron, which is about 9.10938356 × 10^-31 kg.

Calculating (Δp)^2: (1e-24)^2 = 1e-48 (kg²·m²/s²).

Divide by (2m): 2 * 9.1e-31 kg = 1.82e-30 kg.

So ΔE ≈ (1e-48) / (1.82e-30) ≈ 5.49e-19 J.

Wait, that's approximately 5e-19 J, so looking at the options, option C is ~1e-19 J. But wait, my calculation is 5e-19, which is between 1e-19 and 1e-18. Hmm. Let me check if I made an error in calculations.

Wait, let me recompute:

Δp = ℏ / (2Δx) → Wait, did I forget the 2? Because the uncertainty principle is Δx * Δp ≥ ℏ/2. So the correct expression is Δp ≈ ℏ/(2Δx).

Oh, right! I made a mistake earlier. So I should use 2Δx in the denominator.

So let's recalculate Δp.

ℏ = 1.05e-34 J·s.

Δx = 1e-10 m.

Δp ≈ (1.05e-34) / (2 * 1e-10) ) = (1.05e-34)/(2e-10) = (1.05 / 2) * 1e-24 = 0.525e-24 = 5.25e-25 kg·m/s.

Wait, no, wait, 1e-34 divided by 2e-10 is (1e-34 / 2) * 1e10 → 0.5e-24 → 5e-25 kg·m/s.

So Δp is approximately 5.25e-25 kg·m/s.

Now, let's compute ΔE as (Δp)^2/(2m).

(5.25e-25)^2 = (5.25)^2 × 1e-50 = approx 27.56 × 1e-50 → 2.756e-49.

Divide by (2m): 2 * 9.1e-31 = 1.82e-30.

So ΔE ≈ 2.756e-49 / 1.82e-30 = (2.756 / 1.82) ) * 1e-19.

Calculating 2.756 / 1.82 ≈ 1.515.

So ΔE ≈ 1.515e-19 J.

So approximately 1.5e-19 J. The options are A:1e-18, B:1e-17, C:1e-19, D:1e-16.

So the closest option is C) ~1e-19 J.

Wait, but I'm not sure if the approach is correct. Another approach is to consider the momentum and energy relationship. The kinetic energy E is (p²)/(2m). So the uncertainty in E would be dE = (d p)(p)/(m). Because derivative of E with respect to p is p/m.

But wait, I'm not certain about this approach. Let me think again.

Wait, so E = p²/(2m). So dE = (2p/(2m)) dp = p/(m) dp. So dE = (p/m) dp.

But I don't know p exactly, but perhaps I can take an average p. Alternatively, maybe we can express it in terms of Δp.

But since we don't have the exact value of p, perhaps it's better to use the relation between ΔE and Δp. Alternatively, perhaps another approach is to use the uncertainty principle for energy and time, but wait, the question gives an uncertainty in position, not time. Hmm, maybe that's a different approach. Alternatively, perhaps the kinetic energy is the main contributor to the energy uncertainty.
