Okay, so I've got this question here about an algorithm that converts DNA sequences into numbers. The examples given are:

AGG -> 115
TGCTGA -> 176

And I need to find out what ACAGTGACC gives. The options are A) 315, B) 185, C) 333, D) 351.

Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I think it's about converting each nucleotide into a number and then summing them up, or maybe there's some other method. Let me think.

First, let's look at the examples. So AGG is three nucleotides. The output is 115. TGCTGA is six nucleotides, output 176. I wonder how they're getting those numbers.

Wait, maybe each nucleotide is assigned a value. Like A=1, T=2, C=3, G=4. Or some other numbering. Let me test that.

For AGG: A is 1, G is 4, G is 4. So 1 + 4 +4 =9. But 9 is nowhere near 115. So that can't be it.

Another approach: perhaps each base is a digit in a number system, maybe base 4 or base 5. Let's see.

Wait, base 4 would have digits 0,1,2,3, but our bases are A,T,C,G. Alternatively, maybe each base is represented by a number, and the sequence is treated as a base-5 number. Let's test that.

Wait, base 4: A=0, T=1, C=2, G=3? Let me see:

AGG in base 4 would be (0 * 4^2) + (3 *4^1) + (3*4^0) = 0 +12 +3 = 15. But the output is 115. Doesn't match.

Hmm, perhaps it's base 10, but that seems unlikely for DNA sequences.

Wait, maybe each base is assigned a value, and the sum is the product of the values. Let me see:

AGG: A=1, G=4, G=4. 1 *4 *4=16. Not 115.

No, that doesn't fit. So maybe it's a different approach. What if each base is converted to
