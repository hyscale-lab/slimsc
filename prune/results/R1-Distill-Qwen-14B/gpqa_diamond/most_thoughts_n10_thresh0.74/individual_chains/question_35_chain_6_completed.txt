Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Hmm, angular momentum... I remember that angular momentum operators are related to spin matrices. The problem gives me that the operator A_y is represented by a 2x2 matrix, which is c times S, where c is h/(4π). The matrix S has the first row as (0, -i) and the second row as (i, 0). 

Wait, I think S here is similar to the Pauli matrices. Oh right, the Pauli matrices are sigma_x, sigma_y, sigma_z. The sigma_y matrix is exactly like S here: [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So S must be the sigma_y matrix, right? 

So A_y = c * S = (h/(4π)) * σ_y. Now, I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A_y. 

Eigenvalues come from solving the characteristic equation det(A_y - a I) = 0. Let's write down A_y matrix. 

c is h/(4π), so A_y = [[0, -i c], [i c, 0]]. So the matrix is:
[ [0, -i*(h/(4π))],
  [i*(h/(4π)), 0] ]

The eigenvalues equation is det(A_y - a I) = 0. 

So the matrix becomes:
[ [-a, -i c],
  [i c, -a ] ]

The determinant is (-a)(-a) - ( (-i c)(i c) ) = a² - ( (-i)(i) c² ) 

Wait, (-i c)(i c) is (-i)(i) c². Let me compute that: (-i)(i) = -i² = -(-1) = 1. So this term is (i c)(-i c) = (i * -i) c² = (1) c². Wait, no, wait: wait, let me compute (-i c)(i c) again. Oh, wait, ( -i c ) multiplied by ( i c ) is (-i)(i) (c)(c) )= (-i^2) c². Since i^2 = -1, that's (-(-1)) c² = (1) c². So the determinant is a² - (c²) = 0.

So the equation is a² - c² = 0 → a² = c² → a = ±c. So the eigenvalues are +c and -c. 

What's c? c is h/(4π). So the eigenvalues of A_y are h/(4π) and -h/(4π). So the real parts are h/(4π) and -h/(4π), and the imaginary parts are zero. Wait, wait a minute. The eigenvalues for angular momentum components are purely real, right? Because they are Hermitian operators. So both options A and B are talking about complex eigenvalues, which doesn't make sense. Wait, but looking at the options again, option A says the imaginary parts are ±2πh, and real parts are ±h/(4π). That can't be right because the eigenvalues are real. Option B says the imaginary parts are ±1/2, real parts ±1. Also, that's not matching because our eigenvalues are ±h/(4π), which are real. 

Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me re-express the matrix. Let me compute the eigenvalues again. 

The matrix A_y is [[0, -i c], [i c, 0]]. The trace is 0, determinant is (c)^2. So the eigenvalues are sqrt(c^2) and -sqrt(c^2). So sqrt(c^2) is c, so eigenvalues are ±c. So a = ± h/(4π). So the eigenvalues are real, no imaginary parts. So none of the options A or B is correct because both suggest complex eigenvalues. Hmm. 

Wait, looking at the options again. Option C says the eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of the Z-component. Let me think. The operator A is the angular momentum, which for spin-1/2 particles (since muons are spin-1/2), the total angular momentum J is (ħ/2) times the Pauli matrices. Wait, but in this case, A is the y-component, which is a part of the total angular momentum. 

Wait, J² is the total angular momentum squared, which is ħ² s(s+1), where s=1/2. So J² has eigenvalues ( (1/2)(1/2 +1) ) ħ² = (3/4) ħ². 

But the operator A², which is (A_x² + A_y² + A_z²), but wait, no, A is the y-component, so A² is (A_y)^2. So if a state is an eigenstate of A_y, what about A²? Since A² is (A_y)^2, which is a scalar multiple of the identity matrix for spin-1/2. Because A_y is a 2x2 matrix, and when you square it, you get something proportional to identity. Let me compute that. 

A_y squared is (h/(4π))^2 * σ_y^2. σ_y squared is identity matrix, so (A_y)^2 = (h²/(16 π²)) * I. So any eigenvector of A_y is also an eigenvector of (A_y)^2. So option C says the eigenfunctions of A_y can also be eigenfunctions of A². But since A² is a multiple of identity, every vector is an eigenstate, so yes, they can. So the first part of option C is correct. But what about the second part: not of the Z-component, Az? 

Well, the eigenfunctions of A_y are not eigenfunctions of A_z. Because the operators A_y and A_z don't commute. [A_y, A_z] = iħ A_x, which is non-zero. Therefore, if a state is an eigenstate of A_y, it cannot be an eigenstate of A_z. So option C says the eigenfunctions can be eigenfunctions of A² but not Az. That seems correct. 

Option D says the eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. Hmm, basis functions being the eigenvectors? Well, any operator's eigenvectors form a basis for the space. So for a 2x2 matrix, the two eigenvectors form a basis. So the eigenfunctions are the basis functions for Ay. So D says that, which would be correct? Or is it saying something else? 

Wait, the question says "the eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above." So the operator is represented in the basis of its own eigenvectors. Which is true because any diagonalizable matrix can be represented in a basis of its eigenvectors. So D seems correct. Wait, but I need to check the options again. 

Let me reevaluate. The options are:

A) Imaginary parts ±2πh, real parts ±h/(4π). No, eigenvalues are real, so A is wrong.

B) Imaginary parts ±1/2, real parts ±1. Also suggests complex eigenvalues, wrong.

C) Eigenfunctions can be eigenfunctions of A² but not Az. As discussed, this seems correct.

D) Eigenfunctions are the basis functions of Ay. Well, that's true because the eigenvectors form a basis. So D is also correct. 

Wait, so which options are correct? The question asks which statement is correct during the calculation.

But wait, let me think again. The problem is a multiple-choice question, and I'm to choose the correct statement. So either C and D are correct, but looking back at the options, perhaps both are correct. But that can't be. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, let me re-examine each option.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above. 

Wait, the matrix operator is 2x2, and the eigenvectors form a basis for the 2-dimensional space. So yes, the eigenfunctions form a basis for the operator. So D is correct.

But then, why is C also correct? Because the eigenfunctions are eigenfunctions of A^2, which is correct, but not of Az. 

So perhaps both C and D are correct. But the options are single-choice. So I must have made a mistake here.

Wait, what is the question exactly? The question is, during the calculation, which statement will you consider to be correct.

So which of these statements is correct, given that Ay has eigenvalues ±h/(4π) and eigenvectors which are eigenfunctions of A² and not Az.

Hmm, let's think about each option again.

Option C: The eigenfunction of Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A^2, but not of Az.

Since A^2 is (A_y)^2, which is a scalar multiple of identity. So any state is an eigenstate of A^2, regardless of being an eigenstate of Ay. So the eigenfunctions of Ay are automatically eigenfunctions of A^2, because A^2 is proportional to identity. So option C's first part is correct. The second part is also correct, as the state can't be an eigenstate of Az if it is of Ay because of the commutator.

So option C is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. That's correct because the eigenvectors form a basis for the operator's space. So D is also correct. 

Wait, but perhaps the eigenvectors are not orthogonal or something? No, for a Hermitian operator, eigenvectors corresponding to distinct eigenvalues are orthogonal. So they form an orthogonal basis.

But the options are mutually exclusive. So perhaps only one option is correct.

Wait, let me think about the structure of the problem again.

Ay being a 2x2 matrix, which is Hermitian (since it's a component of angular momentum). So its eigenvectors form an orthonormal basis. So the statement in option D is correct. So D would be correct.

But then, in the problem, multiple options could be correct, but in the case of a multiple-choice question, only one is correct, so perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, let's go back to the question: the options are statements that will you consider to be correct during the calculation.

So which one is correct? Let's think again.

Option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions. So the matrix can be represented in the basis of its own eigenvectors, which is correct. So D is correct.

Option C says that the eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. Since A² is a scalar, any state is eigenstate of A², so C's first part is correct. So C is a correct statement.

Wait, but in the given options, both C and D seem correct. That can't be, so I must have made a mistake.

Wait, but perhaps the operator A is the Y-component, and the question refers to the intrinsic spin, so S is the spin operator, right? So the intrinsic angular momentum operator would be S, and A is proportional to S_y. So for a spin-1/2 particle, S^2 = (ħ/2)(ħ/2 + 1) I = (3ħ²/4) I.

So for a spin-1/2 particle, A^2 is (c S_y)^2 = c^2 S_y^2. S_y^2 is ( (ħ/2)^2 ) (sigma_y^2) which is (ħ^2/4) I. So A^2 = c^2 ( (ħ²/4) ) I. Since c = h/(4π), let me compute this. ħ = h/(2π), so c = (h/(2π)) / 2 = ħ/2. So c = ħ/2. Then A^2 = (ħ^2/4) * ( (ħ/2)^2 ) I? Wait, no, wait. Let me compute again.

Wait, S is the Pauli matrices, which have eigenvalues ±1. So S_y^2 = I for spin-1/2. Because (sigma_y)^2 is identity. So c^2 S_y^2 = c^2 I.

So for any state, (A_y)^2 φ = (c^2) φ. So the eigenfunctions of A_y are also eigenfunctions of A^2. So statement C is correct.

But then, why is option D correct? Because the eigenfunctions form the basis for the operator. So D is correct. So both C and D are correct statements.

But looking back at the options, perhaps only one is correct. Hmm.

Wait, I need to read the question again. The question is about which statement is correct during the calculation.

Hmm. Let's think about the other options.

Option A and B are incorrect because they suggest complex eigenvalues, which is impossible for Hermitian operators.

So that leaves options C and D. But the question is, which one is correct.

Option C: eigenfunctions can be eigenfunctions of A² but not Az. As we discussed, yes, because A² is a multiple of identity, so yes, any state is an eigenstate. So the first part is correct, and the second part is correct, so C is correct.

Option D: eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. That's correct because any diagonalizable matrix can be expressed in its eigenbasis.

So both C and D are correct statements. But the options are given as A, B, C, D, and the user said that the correct answer is to be selected.

Wait, but perhaps the wording of the options is tricky. Let's look at option D again: "The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above." So the operator Ay is represented in its eigenbasis, which is correct. So D is correct.

Wait, but the question is, which statement is correct during the calculation. So when you calculate the eigenvalues and eigenvectors, which statement is correct.

Option D is a true statement, but perhaps in the context of the question, it's not correct because the matrix is already given in a certain basis, perhaps the computational basis, not the eigenbasis. So the eigenfunctions form a different basis.

Wait, but the basis of the matrix operator Ay is the standard basis, unless stated otherwise. So in the standard basis, the matrix is given, and the eigenfunctions are in that basis? Or are the eigenvectors a different basis? I'm a bit confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about whether the eigenvectors form a basis for the matrix, which they do, so D is correct.

But I'm a bit stuck because both C and D seem correct. But the options are single-choice, so perhaps I need to reevaluate.

Wait, the problem says that the operator has the form Ay = c·S, with S as given. The matrix is given as S's first row (0, -i), second row (i, 0). So S is sigma_y. So the matrix is c sigma_y.

The eigenvalues are ±c, which are ±h/(4π). So the only real eigenvalues.

So the question is about which statement is correct during the calculation of eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

So, looking again at the options:

Option C says the eigenfunctions can be eigenfunctions of A^2, but not of Az. As explained, since A^2 is a scalar, yes. And eigenvectors of A_y are not eigenvectors of Az because they don't commute. So C is correct.

Option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix. So the matrix is represented in the eigenbasis. But the matrix is given in the standard basis, not necessarily the eigenbasis. So the eigenvectors would form a different basis, the eigenbasis of Ay. So the original matrix's representation is in the standard basis, but when you diagonalize it, you can represent it in the eigenbasis. So the eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) form a different basis for the operator, which is correct. So D is correct.

Wait, but the question is whether the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above. The matrix operator is given in a particular basis, perhaps not the eigenbasis. So the eigenfunctions are in the eigenbasis, which may be different from the basis in which the matrix is presented. So perhaps option D is incorrect because the matrix is given in the standard basis, and the eigenfunctions form a different basis.

Ah, so if the operator is given in the standard basis (computational basis), then the eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) are in another basis. So the statement in option D would be incorrect because the eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) are not the same as the basis in which the matrix is presented.

Wait, but any operator can be represented in any basis, including its own eigenbasis. So the operator's matrix in the eigenbasis is diagonal. So the statement in option D is correct in the sense that the eigenfunctions form a basis for the operator, but the operator is given in a different basis. So perhaps the statement D is correct, but perhaps not because the question says the matrix is given as in the standard basis, and the eigenfunctions form a different basis.

This is getting complicated. Let me try to think of another approach.

Let's compute the eigenvectors to see what they look like.

Ay = [[0, -i c], [i c, 0]]

We can write the eigenvalue equation as (Ay - a I) φ = 0.

So for a = c, the matrix becomes:

[[-c, -i c], [i c, -c]]

Which can be written as:

-c [1  i]
   [-i 1]

Wait, no. Let me factor out c:

Ay - a I = c [ [0, -i], [i, 0] ] - a I = c S - a I.

Hmm, perhaps it's easier to look for eigenvectors.

Let's take a = c. So the matrix becomes:

[ [-c, -i c], [i c, -c ] ]

We can factor out c:

c [ [-1, -i], [i, -1 ] ]

So the eigenvector equation is:

[-1, -i] [x]   = 0
[i, -1] [y]

Which gives:

- x - i y = 0
i x - y = 0

From the first equation: x = -i y.

From the second equation: i x = y.

Substituting x from the first into the second: i (-i y) = y → (-i^2) y = y → (1) y = y. So any y is allowed, and x = -i y. So the eigenvector can be written as (x, y) = (-i y, y) = y ( -i, 1 )

So the eigenvector is proportional to ( -i, 1 ). Similarly, for a = -c, the eigenvector would be (i, 1 ), maybe.

So the eigenfunctions are ( -i, 1 ) and ( i, 1 ), up to normalization.

So these are the eigenvectors. Now, the question is about whether these eigenvectors form a basis for the matrix operator Ay. So, they would form an orthonormal basis if normalized and orthogonal.

Thus, option D is correct because the eigenvectors form a basis for the 2x2 space, making them the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay.

But then, looking back, what about option C?

Option C says the eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not Az. As discussed, since A² is a multiple of identity, any vector is an eigenstate, so the eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenstates of A². So option C's first part is correct. The second part is correct because eigenstates of Ay aren't eigenstates of Az due to non-commuting operators.

So both C and D seem correct. But the options can't have multiple correct answers. So perhaps I made a mistake in one of them.

Wait, let's think about the operator A^2. Since A is the y-component, A^2 is just (A_y)^2. That's a scalar multiple of identity, so yes, any state is an eigenstate. So option C's first part is correct.

But then, why is option D correct? Because the eigenfunctions are the basis of the operator. They form a basis, so D is correct.

But the problem is that only one option is correct. Let me look again.

Wait, the question says "which statement below will you consider to be correct." So perhaps both C and D are correct, but looking at the options, perhaps only option C is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps option D is incorrect because the basis functions of the matrix operator would be the standard basis vectors, not the eigenvectors. But that doesn't make sense because any Hermitian matrix can be diagonalized, so its eigenbasis is a valid basis.

Alternatively, perhaps option D is incorrect because the eigenfunctions are not the same as the basis in which the operator is represented. So the statement in D is incorrect because the eigenfunctions form a different basis than the one in which the operator is expressed.

Wait, the operator is given in the standard basis, not the eigenbasis, so the eigenfunctions are in a different basis. So the statement in D says that the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator, which is correct in the sense that the operator can be represented in that basis as a diagonal matrix. So D is correct.

But now I'm going in circles.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is C and D are both correct, but the options don't allow that. But looking back, the initial question only allows one correct answer.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about each option again.

The question is about the calculation of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. During the calculation, which statement is correct.

Option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. So the matrix can be expressed in its own eigenbasis, which is correct. So D is correct.

But wait, the matrix is given in another basis. So in the standard basis, the matrix is as given. In the eigenbasis, the matrix is diagonal. So the statement in D is correct in the sense that the eigenfunctions can form a basis, but the matrix as given is not in that basis.

But the question is considering the statement during the calculation. So perhaps when you find the eigenfunctions, you're using them as a basis for the operator, so D is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is C because the eigenfunctions form a basis for the operator, but the question is about whether they are eigenfunctions of other operators.

But I'm getting stuck. Let me see the options again.

The given options:

A) Imaginary parts ±2πh, real parts ±h/(4π) → wrong, since eigenvalues are real.

B) Imaginary parts ±½, real parts ±1 → wrong.

C) Eigenfunctions can be eigenfunctions of A^2 but not Az → correct.

D) Eigenfunctions form basis → correct.

But since the question says only one option is correct, perhaps I need to reevaluate.

Wait, let me think about the statement in D.

Option D states that the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. So the matrix is represented in the eigenbasis of Ay. But in reality, the matrix is represented in the standard basis (computational basis), not necessarily the eigenbasis. So the statement in D is incorrect because the matrix is given in a different basis. So the eigenfunctions φ are not the basis functions of the operator as given. They form another basis. So D is incorrect.

Ah, that's the key. The operator is given in a particular basis, probably the standard basis. The eigenfunctions are in a different basis. So D is incorrect.

So the correct statements would be C and perhaps D is incorrect.

So the correct option is C.

Wait, but why would option C be correct. Let me think again.

The eigenfunctions of Ay are those vectors that are eigenstates of Ay. Since A² is (Ay)^2, any vector is an eigenstate of A². So C's first part is correct. The second part: eigenfunctions of Ay are not eigenfunctions of Az. So C is correct.

Therefore, the correct statement is option C.


The problem involves the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator, \( A_y \), for a muon. The operator is given as \( A_y = c \cdot S \), where \( c = \frac{h}{4\pi} \) and \( S \) is the \( \sigma_y \) Pauli matrix:

\[
S = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Thus, the matrix representation of \( A_y \) is:

\[
A_y = \frac{h}{4\pi} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Key Analysis of the Options:

1. **Option A**: Claims that the eigenvalues of \( A_y \) have imaginary parts \( \pm 2\pi h \) and real parts \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \). This is incorrect because \( A_y \) is a Hermitian operator, and its eigenvalues must be real. The eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \), both real.

2. **Option B**: Claims that the eigenvalues of \( A_y \) have imaginary parts \( \pm \frac{1}{2} \) and real parts \( \pm 1 \). This is also incorrect because the eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are purely real (\( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \)) and do not involve imaginary components.

3. **Option C**: States that the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) can also be eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \) (where \( A^2 = A_x^2 + A_y^2 + A_z^2 \)) but not of \( A_z \). This is correct because:
   - \( A_y \) is a component of the angular momentum operator, and \( A^2 \) is proportional to the identity matrix for spin-\(\frac{1}{2}\) particles. Thus, any eigenstate of \( A_y \) is automatically an eigenstate of \( A^2 \).
   - However, \( A_y \) and \( A_z \) do not commute (\( [A_y, A_z] = i\hbar A_x \)), so eigenstates of \( A_y \) cannot be eigenstates of \( A_z \).

4. **Option D**: Claims that the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are the basis functions of the matrix operator \( A_y \). This is misleading because the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) form a basis for the operator in its eigenbasis, but the matrix \( A_y \) is given in the standard basis (not the eigenbasis). Therefore, this statement is not strictly correct during the calculation.

### Conclusion:

The correct statement is **Option C**, as it accurately reflects the relationship between the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \), \( A^2 \), and \( A_z \). 

Answer: C
