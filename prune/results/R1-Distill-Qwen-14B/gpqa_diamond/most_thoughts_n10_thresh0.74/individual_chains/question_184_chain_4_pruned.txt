Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct reaction sequence to synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let's break it down.

First, the target molecule: 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So, looking at the benzene ring, there are three substituents. Let me number the positions to visualize. Position 1 is ethoxy, position 2 is tert-butyl, and position 3 is nitro. Wait, wait, wait. No, wait. Wait, benzene is a ring, so numbering depends on the substituents. Oh, right, the substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3. So the ethoxy is at position 1, tert-butyl at 2, and nitro at 3. Is that right? Or maybe I should think about the substituents in a way that minimizes the numbers. Let me draw it mentally.

But regardless, the substituents are at adjacent positions. So I need to figure out how to introduce each group in the correct order, considering the directing effects of each substituent.

I remember that substituents on a benzene ring can direct incoming electrophiles to certain positions. For example, activating groups like -OEt (ethoxy) are ortho/para directors, while deactivating groups like nitro (-NO2) are meta directors. Tert-butyl is a bulky substituent, but it's an activating group because it's an alkyl chain. So it's a strong activating, ortho/para-directing group.

Wait, but the order in which substituents are added matters a lot because each new group can influence where the next group goes. Let's think about the order of addition.

The target has three substituents: ethoxy (OEt), tert-butyl, and nitro (NO2). Let's see their positions.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think about the ethoxy being in position 1, tert-butyl in position 2, and nitro in position 3. Alternatively, maybe the numbering isn't that strict, but the relative positions are.

Wait, another approach: the
