Okay, so I've got this problem where an electron is in a specific spin state, and I need to find the expectation value of its spin along the y-direction, S_y. Hmm, I remember from my notes that the expectation value is the average outcome if you measured S_y many times on identical systems. The formula involves the state vector and the Pauli matrices, I think.

The state given is (3i, 4). Wait, that's a vector with two components, right? So it's a two-component spinor. But I should probably normalize it first, because expectation values work with normalized states. Let me check. The normalization condition is that the sum of the absolute squares of the components equals 1.

So the components are 3i and 4. The absolute square of 3i is |3i|^2 which is (3)^2 = 9, and 4 is |4|^2 = 16. Adding those gives 25, so the norm is 25. Therefore, the normalized state would be (3i/5, 4/5). Oh wait, yeah, because the square root of 25 is 5, so each component is divided by 5.

Now, the spin operator for the y-direction is given as sigma_y, which is a 2x2 matrix:
[ [0, -i],
  [i, 0] ]

The expectation value of S_y is the expectation value of (ħ/2) times sigma_y because S = (ħ/2) * sigma for spin-1/2 particles.

So the expectation value <S_y> is (ħ/2) multiplied by the expectation value of sigma_y.

How do I calculate the expectation value of sigma_y? It's the conjugate transpose of the state vector multiplied by sigma_y, multiplied by the state vector.

Wait, the state vector is a column vector. Let me write the state as |psi> = [3i/5; 4/5]. The conjugate transpose (bra) would be [ -3/5, 4/5 ] because the complex conjugate of 3i is -3i, but wait wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think: the state is (3i,4). When I take the conjugate, each component's complex conjugate is taken. So (3i)* is -3i, and 4* is 4. So the bra is [ -3i/5, 4/5 ].

Wait, no, wait. The state vector is (3i,4), and when normalized, each component is (3i)/5 and 4/5. So the bra vector is the conjugate transpose. So the first component becomes (3i/5)* which is (-3i/5), and the second is (4/5)* which is 4/5.

So the bra is [ (-3i/5), (4/5) ].

Now, I need to compute <psi| sigma_y |psi>.

Let me compute sigma_y |psi> first. Sigma_y is the matrix:

[ 0, -i ]
[ i, 0 ]

So sigma_y multiplied by |psi> = sigma_y [3i/5; 4/5] is:

First component: 0*(3i/5) + (-i)*(4/5) = (-i)(4/5) = -4i/5.

Second component: i*(3i/5) + 0*(4/5) = i*(3i/5) = (3i^2)/5 = (3*(-1))/5 = -3/5.

So sigma_y |psi> is [ -4i/5 ; -3/5 ].

Now, multiply the bra [ (-3i/5) , (4/5) ] with sigma_y |psi> which is [ -4i/5 ; -3/5 ].

So the inner product is:

(-3i/5)(-4i/5) + (4/5)(-3/5)

Let me compute each part.

First term: (-3i)(-4i) = 12 i^2 = 12*(-1) = -12. Then divided by 5*5=25, so first term is -12/25.

Second term: (4)(-3) = -12; divided by 5*5=25, so second term is -12/25.

Adding both terms: -12/25 + (-12/25) = (-24/25).

Wait, wait no: wait, the first term is [ (-3i/5) ] * [ -4i/5 ].

Which is (-3i)(-4i) / (5*5) => (12 i^2 )/(25) => 12*(-1)/25 = -12/25.

The second term is (4/5)*( -3/5 )= (4 * (-3)) / 25 = -12/25.

So sum is (-12 -12)/25 = -24/25.

So the expectation value of sigma_y is -24/25. Therefore, the expectation value of S_y is (ħ/2) * (-24/25).

Wait wait, let me redo the calculation because I might have made a mistake.

Wait, let me compute the inner product again.

Bra: [ (-3i/5), (4/5) ]

sigma_y |psi> is [ (-4i/5), (-3/5) ]

So the inner product is:

( (-3i/5) * (-4i/5) ) + ( (4/5) * (-3/5) )

Compute each term:

First term: (-3i/5)*(-4i/5) = (12 i²)/(25) = 12*(-1)/25 = -12/25.

Second term: (4/5)*(-3/5) = (-12)/25.

So adding both: (-12/25) + (-12/25) = (-24)/25.

Wait, that's correct.

So < sigma_y > is -24/25.

Therefore, < S_y > = (ħ/2) * (-24/25) = (-24 ħ) / (50) = (-12 ħ)/25.

Wait, because 24/2 is 12, so 24/25 * (1/2) is 12/25. So overall, it's (-12 ħ)/25.

Looking at the options, option A is -12 ħ /25, which matches.

But let me double-check all steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Alternative approach: Using the formula for expectation value.

The formula for <S_y> is (ħ/2) times [ psi^† sigma_y psi ].

Alternatively, another way to compute <S_y> is using the formula:

<S_y> = (ħ/2) [ (psi_2 psi_1^* ) - (psi_1 psi_2^* ) ]

Wait, wait, because sigma_y in terms of the components when you compute psi† sigma_y psi.

Wait, sigma_y is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So when you multiply psi† sigma_y psi, it's:

psi† sigma_y psi = [ a*, b* ] [ [0, -i], [i, 0] ] [a; b] 

So compute it as:

= a* * (0*a + (-i)*b) + b* * (i*a + 0*b)
= a* (-i b) + b* (i a )
= (-i a* b ) + (i b* a )

Which can be written as i (b* a - a* b )

Hmm, but perhaps it's easier to compute the inner product as above.

Wait, but considering our state |psi> = [3i/5; 4/5], so a = 3i/5, b=4/5.

So a* is (3i/5)* = -3i/5.

So, substituting into the formula:

psi† sigma_y psi = (-i)(a* b) + i (b* a )

So compute a* b: (-3i/5)(4/5) = (-12 i)/25.

And b* a: (4/5)(3i/5) = (12i)/25.

So,

= (-i) * (-12i/25) + i * (12i/25 )

= (12 i² )/25 + (12 i² )/25 

i squared is -1, so:

= (12 (-1) )/25 + (12 (-1) )/25 

= (-12/25) + (-12/25) = (-24)/25.

Which matches what I got earlier.

Thus, <S_y> = (ħ/2) * (-24/25) = (-12 ħ)/25.

Looking at the options, option A is -12 hbar /25. So the correct answer should be A.


To find the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction, \( S_y \), for an electron in the spin state \( (3i, 4) \), we proceed as follows:

### Step 1: Normalize the state
The given state is \( | \psi \rangle = (3i, 4) \). The norm is calculated as:

\[
\| \psi \|^2 = |3i|^2 + |4|^2 = 9 + 16 = 25.
\]

Thus, the normalized state is:

\[
| \psi \rangle = \frac{1}{5}(3i, 4) = \begin{pmatrix} \frac{3i}{5} \\ \frac{4}{5} \end{pmatrix}.
\]

### Step 2: Spin operator for \( S_y \)
The spin operator for the y-direction is \( S_y = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_y \), where \( \sigma_y \) is the Pauli matrix:

\[
\sigma_y = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

### Step 3: Compute \( \langle \psi | \sigma_y | \psi \rangle \)
The expectation value of \( \sigma_y \) is given by:

\[
\langle \psi | \sigma_y | \psi \rangle = \begin{pmatrix} \frac{-3i}{5} & \frac{4}{5} \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} \frac{3i}{5} \\ \frac{4}{5} \end{pmatrix}.
\]

First, compute \( \sigma_y | \psi \rangle \):

\[
\sigma_y | \psi \rangle = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} \frac{3i}{5} \\ \frac{4}{5} \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -i \cdot \frac{4}{5} \\ i \cdot \frac{3i}{5} \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -\frac{4i}{5} \\ -\frac{3}{5} \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Next, compute the inner product \( \langle \psi | \sigma_y | \psi \rangle \):

\[
\langle \psi | \sigma_y | \psi \rangle = \begin{pmatrix} \frac{-3i}{5} & \frac{4}{5} \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} -\frac{4i}{5} \\ -\frac{3}{5} \end{pmatrix}.
\]

\[
\langle \psi | \sigma_y | \psi \rangle = \left( \frac{-3i}{5} \cdot -\frac{4i}{5} \right) + \left( \frac{4}{5} \cdot -\frac{3}{5} \right).
\]

Simplify each term:

1. \( \frac{-3i}{5} \cdot -\frac{4i}{5} = \frac{12i^2}{25} = \frac{12(-1)}{25} = -\frac{12}{25} \),
2. \( \frac{4}{5} \cdot -\frac{3}{5} = -\frac{12}{25} \).

Adding these:

\[
\langle \psi | \sigma_y | \psi \rangle = -\frac{12}{25} - \frac{12}{25} = -\frac{24}{25}.
\]

### Step 4: Compute \( \langle S_y \rangle \)
The expectation value of \( S_y \) is:

\[
\langle S_y \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \langle \psi | \sigma_y | \psi \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot -\frac{24}{25} = -\frac{12 \hbar}{25}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The expectation value of \( S_y \) is \( -\frac{12 \hbar}{25} \), which corresponds to **Option A**.
