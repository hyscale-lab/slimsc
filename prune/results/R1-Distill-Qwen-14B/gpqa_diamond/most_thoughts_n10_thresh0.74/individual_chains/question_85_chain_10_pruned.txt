Okay, so I've got this problem here about two planets orbiting a star, and I need to find the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, equilibrium temperature... I remember that's the temperature a planet would have if it's in thermal equilibrium, right? So it's calculated based on the star's luminosity and the planet's distance from the star.

Wait, the problem gives me a lot of data. Let me jot it down. The star has a mass of 1.5 solar masses, radius 1.2 times the sun, and effective temperature 6300 K. The two planets have different masses and radii. Planet1 is 7 Earth masses and radius 1.7 Earth, Planet2 is 5 Earth masses, radius 1.3 Earth. Both orbits are circular.

They detected the planets using transit and radial velocity methods. The RV method measures the Doppler shift due to the planet's gravitational pull on the star. So the shifts they mentioned (0.03 Å for Planet1, 0.04 Å for Planet2) are related to their masses and orbital periods, I think.

But wait, the question is about equilibrium temperature, which depends on the distance from the star. Oh, right, because the further away a planet is, the less starlight it receives, so lower temperature. So I need to find the distance of each planet from the star.

How do I get the distance? Oh, the radial velocity method gives the velocity of the star due to the planet's orbit. The Doppler shift relates to the velocity. But I'm not sure of the exact formula here. Let me think: the Doppler shift (Δλ) is given by (v/c) * λ0, where v is the velocity, c the speed of light, and λ0 the rest wavelength.

Wait, the problem gives the shift in forbidden line [OI] at 6300 Å. So for each planet, the shift can be used to find v, the star's velocity due to the planet. 

The formula for Doppler shift is Δλ/λ = v/c. But since the shifts are given in absolute terms (like up to 0.03 Å for Planet1), I can calculate the velocity amplitude for each planet.

So for Planet1: Δλ = 0.03 Å, λ0 = 6300 Å. So Δλ/λ0 = 0.03/6300 = 4.76e-6. Assuming v = c * (Δλ/λ0), but wait, c is about 3e5 km/s. So 3e5 km/s * 4.76e-6 ≈ 1.428 km/s. Hmm, that's the velocity of the star's orbit's amplitude. 

Same for Planet2: Δλ=0.04, so 0.04/6300 = ~6.349e-6. v = 3e5 * 6.349e-6 ≈ 1.9047 km/s.

But wait, the RV method gives the semi-amplitude K of the star's velocity. The formula for K is ( (G * (M_planet) * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_plan
