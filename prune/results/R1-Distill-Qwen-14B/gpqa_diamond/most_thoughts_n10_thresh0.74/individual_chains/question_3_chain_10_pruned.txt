Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me go through it step by step. 

The question says that a spin-half particle is in a linear superposition: 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. The states |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz. We need to find the expectation value of the operator 10σz +5σx. The options are given, and I need to choose the correct one.

Hmm, okay, expectation value. I remember that the expectation value of an operator is calculated as ⟨ψ| O |ψ⟩, where O is the operator and ψ is the state. So for this problem, I'll have to compute the expectation values for each part of the operator separately and then add them up.

The operator is 10σz +5σx. So the expectation value ⟨O⟩ = 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩. I can calculate each expectation value separately.

First, let's find ⟨σz⟩. Since |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz, with eigenvalues +1 and -1 respectively. So the expectation value of σz is just the sum of the probabilities multiplied by their respective eigenvalues.

The state is given as 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. Let me write that more clearly: ψ = (0.5)|↑⟩ + (√3/2)|↓⟩. Wait, since it's a spin-½ particle, I should check if this state is normalized. Let me compute the squared magnitudes:

(0.5)^2 + (√3/2)^2 = 0.25 + (3/4) = 0.25 +0.75 =1. So yes, it's normalized, which is good.

So, the coefficients are a=0.5 and b=√3/2 for |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ respectively.

The expectation value ⟨σz⟩ is |a|^2 * (+1) + |b|^2 * (-1). 

Calculating |a|^2: (0.5)^2 = 0.25
|b|^2: (√3/2)^2 = (3/4) =0.75

So ⟨σz⟩ = 0.25*(1) + 0.75*(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5.

So that's -0.5. Then, 10⟨σz⟩ =10*(-0.5) =-5.

Now, moving on to ⟨σx⟩. Oh wait, σx is the Pauli X matrix, which doesn't have |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ as eigenstates. So I can't directly compute it as I did for σz. I think I'll need to express σx in terms of its matrix form or use the eigenstates.

Alternatively, I remember that σx has eigenstates that are the superpositions of |↑⟩ and |↓⟩. But perhaps a more straightforward way is to compute the expectation value directly.

The Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So σx = |↑⟩⟨↓| + |↓⟩⟨↑|.

The expectation value ⟨σx⟩ is ⟨ψ| σx |ψ⟩.

Let me compute this. So expanding ψ:

ψ = a|↑⟩ + b|↓⟩, where a=0.5, b=√3/2.

Then, σx |ψ⟩ = σx (a|↑⟩ + b|↓⟩) = a σx |↑⟩ + b σx |↓⟩.

Since σx |↑⟩ = |↓⟩ and σx |↓⟩ = |↑⟩, because σx flips the spin.

So σx |ψ⟩ = a|↓⟩ + b|↑⟩.

Then, ⟨ψ| σx |ψ⟩ = (a* ⟨↑| + b* ⟨↓| ) (a |↓⟩ + b |↑⟩ )

Multiply them out:

a* a ⟨↑| ↓ ⟩ + a* b ⟨↑| ↑⟩ + b* a ⟨↓| ↓ ⟩ + b* b ⟨↓| ↑⟩.

I know that ⟨↑| ↓⟩ =0, and ⟨↑| ↑⟩=1, same for ⟨↓| ↓⟩=1 and ⟨↓| ↑⟩=0.

So the terms become:

0 + a* b *1 + b* a *1 +0.

Which is 2 Re(a b* ), but wait, since a and b are real numbers here, because 0.5 and sqrt(3)/2 are real, so a* =a and b* =b.

So the expression simplifies to a*b +b*a = 2ab.

Wait, let me recheck. Because when I expand (a* a ⟨↑| ↓⟩ is zero, a* b ⟨↑| ↑⟩ is a*b, then b* a ⟨↓| ↓⟩ is b*a, and the last term is zero. So together, it's a*b + b*a = 2ab.

So ⟨σx⟩ = 2ab.

Wait, but that seems a bit confusing. Let me think again.

Wait, when I expand ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩, it's (a* ⟨↑| + b* ⟨↓|)(a |↓⟩ + b |↑⟩).

So,

a* a ⟨↑ | ↓⟩ = a² *0 = 0,
a* b ⟨↑ | ↑⟩ = a b,
b* a ⟨↓ | ↓⟩ = b a,
b
