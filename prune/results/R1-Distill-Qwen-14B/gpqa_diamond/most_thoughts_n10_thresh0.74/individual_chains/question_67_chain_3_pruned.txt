Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. Let me read it again and break it down.

The question is about two electrons in p orbital angular momentum states. We're ignoring their spin angular momentum, which probably simplifies things a bit. The coupled angular momentum state is given as |l1, l2, l, m> = |1,1,2,-1>. So each electron has l=1 for their orbital angular momentum. The total angular momentum l for the combined system is 2, and m is -1.

The question asks for the joint probability of measuring both L1z and L2z to be -ħ. So, each electron's orbital angular momentum in the z-direction is -ħ. Since we're dealing with two electrons, their individual L_z eigenvalues are being measured.

Hmm, I remember that the eigenvalue of L_z is mħ for each particle. So if each electron is in a state where m is -1, their L_z would be -ħ each. Wait, but in the given state, the total m is -1 for the combined system. So how does that relate to the individual m's?

Wait, the state is |1,1,2,-1>. So the total m is -1. But each electron has l=1, so each can have m1 and m2 ranging from -1 to +1. The total m is m1 + m2. So when the total m is -1, that could come from combinations like m1 = 0 and m2 = -1, or m1 = -1 and m2 = 0, or m1 = 1 and m2 = -2, but wait, wait, no, because each m can only be -1, 0, or +1. So possible combinations for m1 + m2 = -1:

m1 = -1 and m2 = 0.

m1 = 0 and m2 = -1.

m1 = 1 and m2 = -2 → but m2 can't be -2 because l=1. So only the first two possibilities.

So the total state is supposed to be a combination of these two m states. But the given state is |1,1,2,-1>, so that's the state with l=2 and m=-1.

Wait, but how is this state expressed in terms of
