Okay, so I have this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure out the right answer. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question is about selecting suitable reagents for two reactions. The first reaction involves butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and a reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Then, the second reaction uses the product from the first (2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile) with reagent B (which is H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

Hmm, wait. Let me break it down step by step.

First Reaction:
Butan-2-one (which is (CH3)2CO) reacting with NaCN and reagent A. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me write the structures to visualize.

Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. When it reacts with NaCN, I think this is a nucleophilic addition, like the formation of a cyanohydrin. So, the mechanism would be that the ketone reacts with a cyanide ion. But wait, in the presence of an acid catalyst, right? Because the cyanide ion is a weak nucleophile and might need some protonation to help the reaction.

So, the first step is the formation of a cyanohydrin. The general reaction for that is ketone + HCN (or NaCN under acidic conditions) to form the cyanohydrin. The acid (like H3O+ or H2SO4) would protonate the carbonyl, making it more electrophilic. Then the CN- attacks, followed by water to give the alcohol. So, reagent A is probably an acid, like H3O+.

Looking at the options, which reagents A are acidic. Option A says A is H3O+, option B same. C and D have A as NaHSO3, which is a source of HSO3- but maybe for other reactions.

So for the first reaction, the correct reagent is probably an acid like H3O+.

Second Reaction:
The product from the first reaction is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, no, actually, the second starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. So it's a secondary alcohol with a nitrile group attached.

Then, it's reacting with reagent B (H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. So the nitrile group is being converted to a carboxylic acid.

Hmm, the conversion of nitrile to carboxylic acid typically involves hydrolysis. The usual conditions are either acidic or basic. Let me think about the conditions for this hydrolysis.

Nitriles can be hydrolyzed to carboxylic acids under strong acidic or basic conditions. For example, in acidic conditions, the nitrile is protonated, and with water, it goes through a series of reactions to form the carboxylic acid. Alternatively, under basic conditions, like with KMnO4 and heat, or using other strong bases, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details.

Wait, the second reaction uses H2O as reagent B. So maybe the reagent B is a catalyst or another component for the hydrolysis. Let me think.

In the first step, the cyanide (from NaCN) is added to the ketone under acidic conditions. Therefore, the product has an alcohol and a nitrile group.

In the second step, to convert the nitrile to a carboxylic acid, under what conditions does that happen? I think that typically, nitriles are hydrolyzed to carboxylic acids using strong acid or base. But another possibility is using H2O with a strong acid or base. Wait, but the product is a carboxylic acid, which suggests that the hydrolysis is complete.

Wait, but in the second reaction, the starting material is a nitrile and an alcohol (2-hydroxybutanenitrile), and the product is 2-hydroxybutanoic acid. So the nitrile becomes a COOH group.

So, the reaction is nitrile → carboxylic acid. The typical way to do this is through hydrolysis. For example, under acidic conditions (like HCl) with heat and water, or under basic conditions (like NaOH) with heat and water. Alternatively, using KMnO4 under acidic conditions can oxidize nitriles to carboxylic acids, but that's under strong acidic conditions.

Wait, but in the second reaction, the reagent B is H2O. So perhaps the reaction uses an acid catalyst. Or maybe B is the acid.

Looking at the options, what's the possible reagent B?

Option A: B = HCl. Option B: B=CH3COOH. Option C: B=HCl. Option D: B=CH3COOH.

Wait, the second reaction uses H2O as a reagent, along with B. So B is a reagent that's either an acid or a base.

So, the second reaction is nitrile → carboxylic acid. Let me think about the reagents.

If the conditions are acidic, the nitrile would hydrolyze in H2O with H+ to form the carboxylic acid. Alternatively, using a strong acid like HCl as a catalyst.

Another possibility is that the nitrile is treated with H2O and an acid catalyst, like HCl. For example, heating under reflux with concentrated HCl and water.

Wait, but another thought: sometimes oxidizing agents are used. For example, KMnO4 in acidic conditions can oxidize nitriles to carboxylic acids. But I'm not sure if that's what's happening here.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitrile group is being converted via a two-step process: first to an amide, then to a carboxylic acid, but that's more for primary amines or something else.

Wait, let me think about the general hydrolysis of nitriles. Nitriles can be hydrolyzed under acidic or basic conditions to produce carboxylic acids or their salts, respectively.

In the presence of H2O and an acid catalyst (like HCl), nitriles can hydrolyze to carboxylic acids. The reaction might look like this:

R-CN + H2O (H+ catalyst) → R-COOH + NH3 (which then gets protonated and leaves as NH4+).

So, for the second reaction, if reagent B is HCl, then the nitrile would hydrolyze in H2O with HCl as a catalyst to form the carboxylic acid.

Looking at the options, options A and C have B as HCl. Option A has B=HCl and A=H3O+. Option C has A=NaHSO3, which I'm not as familiar with but think it's used in other types of reactions.

Wait, but in the first reaction, the reagent A is H3O+ (acid). So if I'm right, in the second reaction, the reagent B is HCl, which is an acid. That would fit with option A or C.

Wait, wait. Looking at the options:

A) A = H3O+, B = HCl

B) A = H3O+, B = CH3COOH

C) A = NaHSO3, B = HCl

D) A = NaHSO3, B = CH3COOH

So if the first reaction needs H3O+ (as per what I thought earlier), then options A and B are possible. But in the second reaction, if B is HCl, then options A and C are possible.

But let's think again. The first reaction is formation of cyanohydrin. That requires an acid catalyst, like H3O+ or H2SO4. So in the options, A and B have A as H3O+. So that's correct.

So the first reaction is done with H3O+ as A.

The second reaction needs to hydrolyze the nitrile to a carboxylic acid. So the reagent B is either HCl or something else.

But wait, another point: the product in the first reaction is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, but the second starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. So perhaps the second reaction is the hydrolysis of the nitrile group to a COOH group in the presence of H2O and an acid catalyst.

So for the hydrolysis, the conditions are acidic. So reagent B is HCl, as a catalyst.

Therefore, in the options, for the second reaction, B is HCl, which is option A.

So putting it all together: for the first reaction, A is H3O+; for the second, B is HCl. So the correct option is A.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again about the second reaction. What's the role of reagent B? In the question, it says 'B (H2O)' which might be a typo. Oh wait, the way it's written is:

2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H2O) ---> product.

Wait, that's a bit unclear. So the reagent B is added along with H2O. So perhaps B is not the solvent but the catalyst. So for the hydrolysis, the reagent B is the acid.

So in that case, using HCl as the acid (as B) along with H2O would make sense. So in the options, if B is HCl, then option A would be correct.

But looking at the options, option A has B=HCl. So that would fit.

Wait, but another thought: sometimes the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids requires more than just H+ and H2O. For example, maybe it's done under reflux with concentrated HCl. Or perhaps using a stronger acid.

Alternatively, another reagent could be involved, like H2SO4. But in the options, the only acids are HCl and CH3COOH.

If the reaction uses HCl as the catalyst, then option A is correct. But if it uses something else, like maybe a base, then I'm wrong.

Wait, but the product is a carboxylic acid, which is in the protonated form in acid conditions. So if the reaction is done under acidic conditions, then HCl would be the acid.

So in that case, yes, option A would have B as HCl.

Wait, another angle: the first reaction uses H3O+ as A. Then, the second reaction uses HCl as B.

So the correct option would be A: A=H3O+, B=HCl.

Looking at the options, option A is A=H3O+ and B=HCl, which fits. So the answer should be option A.


The question involves selecting suitable reagents for two reactions. 

### First Reaction:
Butan-2-one reacts with NaCN and reagent A to form 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. This is a nucleophilic addition reaction where the ketone reacts with NaCN under acidic conditions to form a cyanohydrin. The acid catalyst (H₃O⁺) is required to protonate the carbonyl group, making it more electrophilic for the cyanide ion to attack. Therefore, reagent A must be H₃O⁺.

### Second Reaction:
The product from the first reaction, 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile, reacts with reagent B (in the presence of H₂O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. This is the hydrolysis of the nitrile group to a carboxylic acid. The reaction typically requires an acid catalyst, such as HCl, to facilitate the hydrolysis. Among the options, HCl is the most suitable choice for reagent B.

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A**: A = H₃O⁺, B = HCl. This matches the requirements for both reactions.
- **Option B**: A = H₃O⁺, B = CH₃COOH. While H₃O⁺ is correct for the first reaction, CH₃COOH is not strong enough to efficiently hydrolyze the nitrile group in the second reaction.
- **Option C**: A = NaHSO₃, B = HCl. NaHSO₃ is not suitable for the first reaction, as it is not an acid catalyst for cyanohydrin formation.
- **Option D**: A = NaHSO₃, B = CH₃COOH. Both reagents are incorrect for their respective reactions.

### Conclusion:
The correct reagents are A = H₃O⁺ and B = HCl, which corresponds to **Option A**.

Answer: A
