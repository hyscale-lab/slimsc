Okay, so I've got this chemistry question here about isomers and some specific compounds. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to think this through. The question is split into two parts, A and B. Let me tackle them one by one.

Part A is about which compound doesn't show tautomerism. The options are benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. I remember that tautomerism involves the movement of a hydrogen atom and the simultaneous shift of a double bond, like in keto-enol tautomerism. So for tautomerism to occur, there must be a hydrogen adjacent to a carbonyl group.

Benzoquinone: Wait, benzoquinone is a cyclic structure with two ketone groups. Quinones are often diketones. Wait, benzoquinone has two ketone groups on a benzene ring, right? So if it's para-benzoquinone, the carbonyl groups are opposite each other. Now, can it undergo tautomerism? I think tautomerism usually requires conjugated systems or adjacent H and carbonyl. Benzoquinone has two carbonyls but are they in positions that allow H's adjacent? Let me visualize: the benzene ring with two ketones at positions 1 and 2 maybe, or 1 and 4. Oh wait, benzoquinone can have different isomers like 1,2; 1,3; 1,4. But the common ones are 1,4 (para) and 1,2 (ortho). If it's 1,4, the two ketones are opposite. So are there any H's adjacent? On the same carbon as the ketone, no. The adjacent carbons have H's. Wait, maybe not. Let me think: in para-benzoquinone, each carbonyl is on a benzene ring. The adjacent carbons are each connected to two other carbons in the ring. Wait, but the ring itself is fully conjugated. So maybe there's no adjacent H to the carbonyl groups for a shift. So tautomerism might not occur because the H's aren't in the right position. Alternatively, if it's ortho-benzoquinone, perhaps the H's are closer, but I'm not sure. Hmm.

Cyclohexane-1,
