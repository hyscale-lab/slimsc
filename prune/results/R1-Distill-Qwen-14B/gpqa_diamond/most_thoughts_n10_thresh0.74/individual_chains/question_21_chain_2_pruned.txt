Okay, so I've got this chemistry question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it carefully.

The question is about isomers and tautomerism and optical isomerism. Hmm, I remember that isomers are compounds with the same molecular formula but different structures. There are two types mentioned: constitutional and stereoisomers. Constitutional isomers differ in the structure, like where the bonds are, while stereoisomers have the same structure but different arrangements in space, like enantiomers or diastereomers.

The question has two parts, A and B. Let me break them down.

Part A: Which compound among benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does NOT show tautomerism.

Tautomerism is when a compound can shift a hydrogen and a lone pair, like between enol and keto forms. For that to happen, the compound needs to have adjacent double bonds or something that allows such a shift.

Benzoquinone is C6H4O2, with two ketone groups. Wait, benzoquinone is more like a cyclic structure with two ketones. Wait, no, benzoquinone is actually a benzene ring with two ketone groups. Oh wait, no, I think benzoquinone is a benzene ring with two oxygen atoms in a diketone structure. So, it's something like a benzene with two ketone groups in adjacent positions, maybe? Or perhaps it's 1,4-benzoquinone, which is a cyclic diketone.

Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is a six-membered ring with three ketone groups, each on alternating carbons. So, it's like three keto groups around the ring.

Now, tautomerism in such compounds. For example, in benzene rings, if there are adjacent carbonyl groups, they can undergo tautomerism. But wait, benzoquinone has two carbonyl groups attached to the ring. Wait, no, benzoquinone is more like a cyclic structure where the ring has two oxygen atoms, each as part of a carbonyl group. So, for example, in 1,4-benzoquinone, the oxygen is in positions 1 and 4, each as a ketone.

Wait, but the structure of benzoquinone is such that the two ketone groups are across from each other. So, in this case, can they undergo tautomerism? I'm a bit fuzzy on that.

Wait, let me think: Tautomerism requires that there be a hydrogen alpha to a carbonyl group. So, if the carbonyl is attached to a CH group, then the H can shift. But in benzoquinone, each carbonyl is attached to a benzene ring, which is an aromatic system. Are the carbonyls attached to CH groups? Let's see. Benzoquinone has two carbonyl groups, each attached to a benzene ring. So each is at a position where the ring is attached to the carbonyl. So the structure is O=C6H4-C=O? No, wait, maybe. So each carbonyl is at a position where it's attached to two carbons of the benzene ring. So, for example, each carbonyl is a group like O=C-C6H3-O=C-... No, perhaps I'm complicating it.

Wait, benzoquinone is a benzene ring with two oxygen atoms, each as a carbonyl group. So the structure is O=C6H4-C=O? No, that doesn't make sense. Maybe it's O=C6H4-O-C=O, but that's not right. Wait, perhaps it's more accurate to think of benzoquinone as a 1,4-diketone on a benzene ring. So each carbonyl is at positions 1 and 4. So each is attached to the benzene ring, but the adjacent carbons are part of the ring.

So, for tautomerism, there needs to be a hydrogen adjacent to the carbonyl. In benzoquinone, each ketone group is attached to the benzene. So maybe each
