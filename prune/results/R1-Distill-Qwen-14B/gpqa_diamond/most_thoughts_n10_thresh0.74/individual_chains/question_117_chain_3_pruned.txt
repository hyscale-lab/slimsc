Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about optical isomerism in organic compounds. Hmm, optical isomerism refers to compounds that are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, right? They have chiral centers, so the compounds should be chiral and thus capable of showing optical activity.

The question lists four compounds and asks which exhibit optical isomerism. Let me go through each one step by step.

Option 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. So, this is a biphenyl compound with substituents at the 2 and 6 positions on each ring. Wait, the structure is 6,6'-dinitro, so each ring has a nitro group at position 6. And the 2,2' positions have dicarboxylate ester groups. Now, biphenyls can have different conformations, like ortho, meta, para. But for optical isomerism, we're looking for stereoisomerism, which could be due to either double bonds or chiral centers.

Wait, wait. The biphenyl itself is connected by a single bond. So, if the bridge is a single bond, the two rings can rotate freely unless hindered. But in some cases, if there are bulky groups, this could lead to restricted rotation, creating cis and trans isomers. But wait, in this case, the substituents are at 2 and 6 on each ring. Let me visualize the structure. If the substituents are in such a way that when the rings are connected, the groups are on opposite sides, maybe that's possible.

Wait, but for the compound to have optical isomerism, it needs a chiral center or a non-superimposable mirror image due to some kind of stereogenic element. Alternatively, if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it won't be chiral. So, looking at option 1: the substituents are on positions 2 and 6, which are across from each other on the benzene rings. So, perhaps the arrangement could allow for a chiral center.

Alternatively, maybe the nitro groups and the ester groups are arranged in a way that creates a chiral center. Wait, no, the substituents are on the phenyl rings, which are planar. Unless the entire molecule has a chiral center elsewhere.

Wait, no. The compound is
