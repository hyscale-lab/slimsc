Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is asking which sequence of reactions will lead to the high-yield synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene. There are four options, A to D, each with a series of reactions.

First, I need to understand the target molecule. Let's break it down. The compound is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So, benzene ring with substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3. Wait, no wait, benzene is a six-membered ring, so numbering might be different. Wait, the positions are 1,2,3? Hmm, maybe I should sketch the structure.

Wait, the name is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So, the benzene ring has three substituents: at position 1, an ethoxy group (-OCH2CH3); at position 2, a tert-butyl group (-C(CH3)3); and at position 3, a nitro group (-NO2). So, the substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3. Let me visualize that: position 1 is ethoxy, position 2 is tert-butyl, and position 3 is nitro. Wait, but how are these arranged around the ring? Because the numbering would depend on substituents.

But perhaps that's getting ahead of myself. Let's think about the synthesis steps. Starting from benzene, we need to introduce these three substituents in the correct positions.

In aromatic substitution reactions, the directing effects of substituents are crucial. Electrophilic substitution reactions are influenced by the substituents already present on the ring.

So, the substituents can be introduced in a certain order based on their activating or deactivating nature and their directing (ortho/para or meta) tendencies.

Looking at the substituents we need:

- tert-butyl group: a bulky alkyl group. Alkyl groups are activating (since they're electron-donating via induction and +I effect) and are ortho/para directors.

- Ethoxy group (-OCH2CH3): an ether group. Alkoxy groups are strong activating (electron-donating via lone pairs) and are ortho/para directors.

- Nitro group (-NO2): a strong deactivating, meta-directing group.

Wait, but the nitro group is meta-directing. So if we add the nitro group last, the existing substituents would influence where it goes.

Wait, but wait: the order in which substituents are introduced can affect the positions where subsequent groups attach.

So for synthesis, it's important to add substituents in an order that allows each new group to be added in the correct position relative to the existing groups.

So, the target molecule has nitro at position 3. Let's think about the positions.

Wait, the target is 2-(tert-butyl), 1-ethoxy, and 3-nit
