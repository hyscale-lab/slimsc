Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me about the Michael addition reaction. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my organics, but let me try to think this through.

The question has three parts (A, B, C) where each involves a Michael addition, and I need to determine the products based on the given reactants and conditions. Then, I have to match them with the options provided.

First, let me recall what the Michael reaction is. From what I remember, the Michael addition is a nucleophilic addition to an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl compound. The nucleophile, usually an enolate, attacks the beta position, forming a new carbon-carbon bond. This is a conjugate addition, so the alpha-beta unsaturated system is the Michael acceptor, and the enolate is the nucleophile (the Michael donor).

Looking at part A: the reactants are dimethyl malonate and methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, with NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) in EtOH (ethanol). So, NaOEt is a strong base. Dimethyl malonate is a good enolate precursor because it's a diethyl malonate derivative. When treated with a base, it forms an enolate.

Wait, dimethyl malonate has two ester groups. The structure is CH2(CO2Me)2. When deprotonated, the enolate would form at the central carbon, right? So the enolate would have a negative charge on the central carbon, which is a good nucleophile.

The other component is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. The structure would be CH2=CH-C(O)OCH3, but with the substituent on the middle carbon as p-tolyl. Wait, actually, it's (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. So the structure is more like CH2=C(p-tolyl)CO2Me, but wait, wait. Let me get that right. Acrylate is CH2=CHCO2Me. But 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have the substituent on the middle carbon. So structure is CH2-C(p-tolyl)=CHCO2Me? No, wait, I think I'm getting confused. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOOR. So when it's 3-(p-tolyl), the substituent is on the third carbon, but wait, acrylate is only three carbons. So maybe it's CH2=CH-COOR with the substituent on the CH2 part? Or perhaps it's the substituent on the double bond.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=C(p-tolyl)-CO2Me? No, that can't be right because the double bond is between C1 and C2. So maybe it's CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)O2Me? Hmm, perhaps the structure is CH2-CH2 with a double bond, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Alternatively, maybe it's CH2=CH-CO2Me with a p-tolyl group on the CH2 part. Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2
