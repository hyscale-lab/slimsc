Okay, so I've got this vector calculus problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The problem says: There's a vector field f(r) that falls off radially as 1/r² from the origin. The magnitude is f(r) = 1/r², and the field only has a radial component in spherical coordinates. I need to evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of this field, ∇·f, within a sphere of radius R centered at the origin. The options are given as A to D.

Hmm, right. I remember that divergence is a measure of how much a vector field spreads out or converges at a point. And the divergence theorem relates the volume integral of the divergence to the flux through the surface. Oh wait, but wait, the divergence theorem states that the integral of ∇·f over a volume is equal to the flux of the vector field through the surface enclosing that volume. So maybe I can use that?

Wait, but let me recall: The divergence theorem formula is ∫∫∫ (∇·f) dV = ∫∫ (f · n) dA, where n is the outward normal vector and the integral is over the surface. So if I can find the flux of f through the surface of the sphere, that would give me the volume integral of its divergence.

But wait, f(r) is given as having only a radial component and f(r) = 1/r². So in spherical coordinates, the vector field would be f = (1/r²) er
