Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let me see what each step does and what the final product looks like. The question is about counting the chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in product 4.

Alright, the starting material is cyclohexanone. I remember that cyclohexanone is a cyclic ketone, right? So it's a six-membered ring with a ketone group. The first step is treating it with bromine. Hmm, bromine in what conditions? Oh wait, adding bromine to a ketone usually leads to the formation of a dibromide if it's a cyclic ketone. Because in the presence of a base, the alpha hydrogens are abstracted, and then bromine adds. But wait, cyclohexanone has alpha hydrogens adjacent to the carbonyl group. So when you treat it with bromine, I think it undergoes an alpha bromination. But wait, another possibility: maybe it's a dihalide addition, but I think bromine in something like a non-polar solvent like CCl4 would lead to the bromination of the carbonyl group. Wait, no, wait, no. Wait, cyclohexanone can't add Br2 to the carbonyl because that would require a double bond. Oh wait, no, cyclohexanone doesn't have a double bond. So when you add Br2 to a ketone, it's likely an electrophilic addition, but I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, wait. Maybe I should think about the mechanism. Cyclo
