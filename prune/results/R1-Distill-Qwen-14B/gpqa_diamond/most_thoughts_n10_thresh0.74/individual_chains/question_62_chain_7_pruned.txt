Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct sequence of reagents to synthesize a specific compound from ethynylcyclohexane. Hmm. Let me think through this step by step.

The target molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Let me try to draw its structure mentally. So, the main chain is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. That means a cyclohexane ring with a carbonyl group attached, right? And then, attached to the cyclohexane ring is a substituent: a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group. Wait, that would be a CH2-OH connected to a cyclohexyl group, all attached to the cyclohexane ring. So, the substituent is a -CH2-OH attached to the cyclohexane, and that CH2 is also connected to another cyclohexane ring? Or maybe it's a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH(OH) group which is then attached to the main cyclohexane?

Wait, maybe I should break down the name. The main part is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, which is cyclohexane with a CHO group. Then, the substituent is at position 1, which is the same carbon as the aldehyde? Or is it a branch? Wait, the substituent is cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl, which I think is (cyclohexyl)(hydroxymethyl). So, the substituent would be a CH2OH group attached to the cyclohexane, and that CH2 is also connected to another cyclohexane ring.

Wait, perhaps it's a cyclohexane ring with a substituent: a CH(OH) group, which is connected to another cyclohexane. No, maybe not. Let me think again. The substituent is -CH2-OH attached to the cyclohexane ring, and the CH2 is also connected to a cyclohexyl group. So, the structure is cyclohexane with a substituent that's a CH2 group, where one end is attached to the main cyclohexane, the other end has an OH group and a cyclohexyl group attached. So the substituent is [cyclohexyl(CH2OH)] attached to the
