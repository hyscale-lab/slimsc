Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me think about what the question is asking.

The question is about the index of hydrogen deficiency of a product formed from a reaction. The starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. It's reacted with red phosphorus and excess HI. I remember that red phosphorus is often used in the hydrolysis of esters or maybe for some kind of elimination or addition reactions. Wait, no, wait. Red phosphorus is used in the dehydrohalogenation reactions, but more commonly, when you have something like HI and red phosphorus, it's probably a deoxygenation or maybe a reduction.

Wait, I think that when carboxylic acids are treated with reagents like red phosphorus and HI, it's part of the Clemmensen reduction. Oh right, Clemmensen reduces ketones to alkanes. But wait, wait, the starting material here is a carboxylic acid. Hmm, maybe not. Let me think again.

Wait, the starting structure is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. So, the structure has a cyclohexene ring (so one double bond) and a formyl group (CHO) at position 2, and a vinyl group (CH2CH2? No, wait, vinyl is CH2=CH- attached at position 5. So, the substituents are: at position 2, a formyl group; at
