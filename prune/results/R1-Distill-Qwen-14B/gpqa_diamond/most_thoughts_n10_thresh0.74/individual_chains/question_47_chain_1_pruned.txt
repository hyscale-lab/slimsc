Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem to solve. The question is about identifying a compound based on its spectroscopic data. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The molecular formula given is C9H11NO2. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation first to get an idea of the structure. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, C=9, H=11, N=1, O=2. So:

(2*9 +2 -11 -0 +1)/2 = (20-11+1)/2 = 10/2 =5. So five degrees of unsaturation. That could be, for example, a benzene ring (which accounts for 3), a carbonyl group (1), and an amine or an ether (another 1, maybe). Or other combinations.

Looking at the IR data: strong to medium bands around 3420 and 3325 cm-1. Those are likely N-H stretches. So maybe a secondary amine or an amide. The strong band at 1720 cm-1 is probably a carbonyl, like an amide or ester or ketone. But considering the N is present, an amide seems more likely because of the N-H stretches.

Now the 1H NMR data:

1.20 ppm (t, 3H) → this is probably a CH2CH3 group, like an ethyl group. The triplet suggests it's next to a CH2.

4.0 ppm (bs, 2H) → broad singlet, 2H. Maybe an NH2 group, but typically NH2 protons are broader, but maybe it's adjacent to something else. Alternatively, an -OCH2- group could be a possibility. But the integration is 2H, so maybe an ethyl group attached to something else.

Wait, wait. The 4.5 ppm (q, 2H) → quartet, 2H. A quartet suggests coupling with a neighboring CH2 group. So perhaps this is an OCH2CH3 group. Because OCH2 would couple with the adjacent CH3, which would be a triplet. Wait, but the 1.20 ppm is a triplet, which matches with a CH2CH3 group. So maybe the quartet at 4.5 is an OCH2, which is adjacent to another CH2, but maybe I'm getting that wrong.

Wait, another possibility: if the quartet is at 4.5 ppm (2H), that might be -OCH2CO- or something like that. Or perhaps it's part of an amide, but amide groups usually have protons around 5-8 ppm. Hmm.

Looking at the aromatic region: 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H). That suggests a para-substituted aromatic ring. The doublets with equal integration (each 2H) imply para substitution. So two substituents are opposite each other on the benzene ring.

Putting this together: the aromatic protons are split into two doublets, which points to a para-substituted ring. So the substituents
