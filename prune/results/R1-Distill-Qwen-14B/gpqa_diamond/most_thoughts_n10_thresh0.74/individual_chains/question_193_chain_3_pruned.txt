Okay, so I've got this astronomy question in front of me, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. The question is about how the number of stars changes with distance, given a specific relationship between the number of stars and parallax. Hmm.

Alright, let me read the question again. So, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. Wait, so N ∝ 1/plx^5. Parallax is plx, right? And parallax is inversely related to distance. Oh right, because parallax (in arcseconds) is equal to 1 over distance (in parsecs), so plx = 1/r. So plx is inversely proportional to r.

So if N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5, and plx is 1/r, then substituting that in, N would be proportional to 1/( (1/r)^5 ). Let me compute that. 1 divided by (1/r)^5 is the same as r^5, because (1/r)^5 is 1/r^5, and taking reciprocal gives r^5. So N ∝ r^5.

Wait, but wait a second. The question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance (per unit range of distance, r). Hmm, so it's the number of stars per unit distance. Wait, does that change things?

Let me think about it. If N is proportional to r^5, then as r increases, the number of stars increases rapidly. But the question is per unit range of
