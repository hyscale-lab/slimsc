Okay, so I've got this question about astronomy, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again carefully.

The question says that large clouds of neutral hydrogen in deep space absorb the light from background quasars at the Lyman alpha wavelength, which is about 1216 Angstroms. The task is to estimate the lower limit on the redshift of these objects so that they can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes. The options are A)3, B)1.2, C)2.4, D)1.9.

Hmm, I remember that the Lyman alpha emission line is in the ultraviolet part of the spectrum for hydrogen. And when something is at a high redshift, the observed wavelength stretches. So if the quasar's emitted light is at 1216 Angstroms, but the hydrogen cloud is at a higher redshift, their absorption lines would shift into longer wavelengths.

Wait, but wait. The cloud is in front of the quasar, right? So when the quasar's light passes through the cloud, the hydrogen in the cloud absorbs at its own rest frame Lyman alpha wavelength, which is 1216 Angstroms. But the quasar itself might be at a higher redshift. Oh wait, no, the quasar is the background object. So the cloud is at a certain redshift, and the quasar is at a higher redshift.

Wait, no, maybe I got that reversed. If the quasar is behind the hydrogen cloud, then the light from the quasar that reaches us passes through the cloud. The cloud's hydrogen would absorb at a wavelength that's redshifted from the quasar's frame. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's think differently.

The Lyman alpha line is at 1216 Angstroms in the rest frame of the hydrogen. So if the hydrogen is moving away from us (because of the expansion of the universe), that wavelength is stretched. The observed wavelength would be lambda_obs = lambda_rest * (1 + z), where z is the redshift of the hydrogen cloud.

But for us to detect this absorption line in optical wavelengths, the observed wavelength must be in the optical range. Optical telescopes typically observe wavelengths from about 400 nm (violet) to 700 nm (red). Wait, but 1216 Angstroms is 121.6 nm, which is ultraviolet. So for
