Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll take it slow and think it out.

So the question is about a series of organic reactions leading to a final product, and we need to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in product 4. The options are A)8, B)4, C)10, D)7.

Let me first try to break down each step of the reaction.

The starting material is 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. Hmm, I think that's norbornene with a tert-butoxy group at the 7 position. Norbornene is a bicyclic structure, bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene. So the structure has two rings: a five-membered and a six-membered ring, with a bridge. The substituent is an oxygen connected to a tert-butyl group at position 7. So the starting molecule is a diene with an ether substituent.

Step 1: It's combined with 2 equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide at elevated temperature. Hmm, sodium iodide is a good nucleophile. The other molecule is a cyclohexadiene with two dibromomethyl groups at positions 5 and 6. Wait, cyclohexa-1,3-diene would have double bonds at 1-2 and 3-4 positions, I think. So positions 5 and 6 are adjacent to the double bonds?

So the structure would be something like this: a cyclohexene ring with two substituents at C5 and C6. Each substituent is a CH2Br2 group? Wait, no, wait: 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl) would mean each of the positions 5 and 6 has a methyl group that's substituted with two bromines. So each substituent is CH2Br2. So each substituent is a dichloromethyl group, but I'll need to confirm.

But wait, the reaction is happening between the starting molecule and this dienophile, perhaps. Oh, wait, but it's a diene. The starting material is a norbornene, which is a diene. So maybe this is a Diels-Alder reaction. But wait, the starting molecule is a bicyclo with two double bonds? No, norbornene has one double bond. Wait, no, the starting molecule is bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. So it's a norbornene with two double bonds? Or is it a single double bond? Wait, I might be getting confused. Norbornene is bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene, which has one double bond. So the starting material has two double bonds: positions 2 and 5, so hepta-2,5-diene. So it's a conjugated diene?

Wait, no, the structure would have two double bonds? Or perhaps it's a diene meaning that it's a conjugated diene in the ring? Hmm, maybe I should sketch it.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting molecule is a diene, and it's reacting with another di
