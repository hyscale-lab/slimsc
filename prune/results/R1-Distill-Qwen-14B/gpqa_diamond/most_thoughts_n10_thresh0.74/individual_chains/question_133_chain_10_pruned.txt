Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution. Let me read through the question again to make sure I get all the details right.

The solution has a volume of 200.00 cm³, which is 0.2 liters. There are 1.00 grams of KH2PO4 and 1.00 grams of Na2HPO4·2H2O. The molecular weights are given as 136.09 g/mol for KH2PO4 and 177.99 g/mol for the sodium hydrogen phosphate with water.

Hmm, so the question is about the concentration of orthophosphate ions, PO4^3-. Orthophosphate is H3PO4, but in solution, it can dissociate into different forms depending on pH. The problem also gives me the three dissociation constants (Ka1, Ka2, Ka3) for H3PO4 as 7.5e-3, 6.2e-8, and 1.8e-12. 

I remember that the phosphate buffer system can be a bit tricky because it involves multiple dissociation steps. Let me think about the possible species in solution.

So, KH2PO4 is potassium hydrogen phosphate. Its formula is KH2PO4, which dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^- ions. Similarly, Na2HPO4·2H2O is sodium hydrogen phosphate, which would dissociate into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- ions, along with some water of crystallization, but I think that part doesn't affect the ionic form in solution.

When these two salts are dissolved together, they form a buffer solution because they're conjugate acid-base pairs. Specifically, H2PO4^- (which is the acid) and HPO4^2- (the base) are involved. This should be a buffer system governed by the second dissociation constant, Ka2, because H2PO4^- can lose a proton to become HPO4^2-.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The first dissociation is H3PO4 → H2PO4^- + H+. The second is H2PO4^- → HPO4^2- + H+, and the third is HPO4^2- → PO4^3- + H+. So, if I have both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- in solution, the buffer's pKa would be determined by Ka2. That makes sense because the system is between H2PO4^- (acid) and HPO4^2- (base), so the relevant Ka is Ka2.

But the question is about the concentration of PO4^3- ions. Oh, right, because orthophosphate is H3PO4, but in solution, it's usually in one of its deprotonated forms. Wait, no, orthophosphate is the fully deprotonated form, PO4^3-. But in solution, especially in aqueous solutions, it's not very stable because it can accept protons. So, the concentration of PO4^3- would be very low. But wait, does the problem ask for PO4^3- or HPO4^2-? The question says orthophosphate, which is PO4^3-. Hmm.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Orthophosphate is H3PO4, but in solution, it's more commonly found as H2PO4^- or HPO4^2- because it's a weak acid. So, the concentration of PO4^3- would be extremely low because it's the third dissociation step. But given the Ka3 is 1.8e-12, which is very small. So, the solution's concentration of PO4^3- would be determined by the hydrolysis of HPO4^2-.

Wait, but the problem provides both KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. So, the solution contains H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- ions. So, the phosphate species present are H2PO4^-
