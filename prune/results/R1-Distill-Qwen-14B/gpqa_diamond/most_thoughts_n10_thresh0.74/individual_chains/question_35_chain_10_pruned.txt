Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question carefully.

The question is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a matrix operator Ay. The operator is given as Ay = c * S, where c is h/(4π), and S is a 2x2 matrix. The matrix S has the first row as (0, -i) and the second row as (i, 0). 

Hmm, so I remember that the angular momentum operators in quantum mechanics are related to Pauli matrices or maybe spin matrices. Wait, the Pauli matrices are 2x2. Oh right, spin-1/2 systems use these matrices. So S here is probably a spin matrix, maybe like the Pauli matrices multiplied by some factor.

Wait, the Pauli matrices are σx, σy, σz. Let me recall their forms. σx is [[0,1],[1,0]], σy is [[0,-i],[i,0]], and σz is [[1,0],[0,-1]]. Oh wait, the matrix S given here is exactly the same as σy. Because S is [[0,-i],[i,0]], which matches σy. So S is σy.

So S is σy, and the operator Ay is (h/(4π)) * σy. 

Now, the eigenvalues of a spin operator like σy would be ±1, right? Because for the Pauli matrices, each eigenvalue is ±1. So if I compute the eigenvalues of Ay, they should be (h/(4π)) multiplied by ±1. So the eigenvalues a would be ± h/(4π).

Wait, but looking at the options, none of them directly say that. Let me check the options again.

Option A: Imaginary part ±2πh, real part ±h/(4π). Hmm, that doesn't make sense because the eigenvalues should be real for an observable. Wait, but wait a second—Ay is an angular momentum component, which is an observable, so the eigenvalues should be real. 

Wait, hold on, S is σy, which has eigenvalues ±1. So Ay = c * S would have eigenvalues c*(±1), which are ±c. Since c is h/(4π),
