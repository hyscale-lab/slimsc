Okay, so I've got this astronomy question about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I remember that the radial velocity method detects planets by looking at the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum as the planet's gravity causes the star to wobble. 

The question says that two stars with the same mass as our Sun have planets detected using this method. Both planets have masses similar to Neptune, so their masses are about the same. The spectral line shifts are given: planet 1 causes a 5 milliangstrom shift, and planet 2 causes a 7 milliangstrom shift. I need to find how many times longer the orbital period of planet 2 is compared to planet 1.

Wait, I think the radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) is related to the Doppler shift. K is the maximum velocity the star moves towards or away from us. But in this question, they're talking about the wavelength shift, which I think relates to the velocity via the Doppler effect formula.

The wavelength shift (Δλ) is related to velocity (v) by the formula Δλ/λ0 = v/c, where λ0 is the rest wavelength, and c is the speed of light. So v = c * (Δλ / λ0). But since both shifts are measured at the same wavelength, I can probably ignore λ0 and c because they'll cancel out when taking the ratio.

So, the velocity semi-amplitude K is proportional to the wavelength shift. So K1 is 5 milliangstroms, K2 is 7. So K2/K1 = 7/5 = 1.4.

But wait, what's the relation between K and the orbital period? I think the radial velocity amplitude K is given by the formula:

K = ( (G * (M_planet) ) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) ) ) * (1/( (1 - e²)^(1/2) )) ) * ( ( (2π) / P )^(1/3) ) ) / ( (c) )

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up some terms. Alternatively, another approach is to use the formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude:

K = (v) = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p) ) ]^(1/3) * (1/( (1-e²)^(1/2) )) ) * ( (2π) / (P * (1 day in seconds) ) )^(1/3) )

Wait, maybe that's getting too complicated. Alternatively, I remember that for the same star mass and same planet mass, K is inversely proportional to the orbital period P. Because the formula for K involves (2π/P)^(1/3), so K is proportional to (1/P)^(1/3). So K ∝ 1/P^(1/3).

Wait, let me think again. The formula for K is:

K = ( (27 * π) / (8 * c^3) )^(1/3) ) * ( (G * M_p * sin i) ) / ( (M_* + M_p) ) ) * ( (1) / ( (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) * (1 / P^(1/3) )

Wait, maybe it's easier to relate K and P when other factors are constant. Since both stars have the same mass and both planets have the same mass (Neptune-like), and assuming the orbits are circular (so e=0, so the denominator is 1, same for both), the ratio of K1 to K2 would be inversely proportional to the cube root of the ratio of their periods.

Wait, if K is proportional to (1/P)^(1/3), then K ∝ 1/P^(1/3). So if K2 is larger than K1, then P2 is larger than P1, but by how much?

Let me set up the ratio. Let’s denote K1 and K2 as the velocities for planet 1 and 2 respectively.

K1 = (some constant) * (1/P1)^(1/3)
K2 = same constant *
