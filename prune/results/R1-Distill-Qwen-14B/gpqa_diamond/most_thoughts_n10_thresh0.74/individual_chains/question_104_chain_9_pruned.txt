Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, I remember that the RV method measures the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum because the planet's gravity causes the star to wobble. The shift in the spectral lines tells us about the star's motion towards or away from us.

The question says there are two stars with the same mass as the Sun, and each has a planet with mass similar to Neptune. So both stars are identical, and the planets are similar in mass. Both planets are in circular orbits.

The problem gives the periodic shifts in the spectral lines. Planet #1 has a shift of 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2 is 7 milliangstroms. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1.

Wait, I remember that the RV method relates the velocity of the star to the mass of the planet and the orbital period. The formula for the semi-amplitude K (the velocity semi-amplitude) is given by:

K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) )^(1/3) ) * ( (P) / (2π) ) )^(−1/3)

But wait, because the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's mass (since Neptune is much less than the Sun), M_* + M_p ≈ M_*. So that simplifies things. Also, since the orbits are circular, e=0, so we don't have to worry about that term.

So the formula simplifies to:

K = [ (G * M_p) / (M_* ) ]^(1/3) * (P/(2π)) )^(-1/3)

Wait, maybe another way to write it. The RV semi-amplitude K is related to the orbital period P and the velocity. Let me think about the relationship.

Alternatively, I think the velocity semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_p / M_*) ) * (1 / sqrt(a)) ), but I'm not sure. Maybe it's better to think about the relation between K and the orbital period.

Wait, another approach. The star and planet orbit their common center of mass. The star's velocity is given by K = (2π G)^(1/3) * ( (M
