Okay, I'm trying to figure out this question about the Mott-Gurney equation. So, the question is about the conditions under which this equation is valid. I remember that the Mott-Gurney equation is related to the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) regime in semiconductor devices.

The equation given is J = (9/8) * ε * μ * V² / L³. I think ε is the dielectric constant, μ is the carrier mobility, and L is the device length. So, the equation relates current density J to the voltage V.

Now, looking at the options. Each option is describing different conditions for the validity of the equation.

Option A: Trap-free single-carrier with Ohmic contact and negligible drift current. Wait, trap-free makes sense because traps would complicate the current, like in Fowler-Nordheim tunneling. Ohmic contact probably means that the contact doesn't have any barrier, so carriers can move easily. And negligible drift current—wait, but in the SCLC region, isn't drift current the main component? Or is it the other way around? Maybe I should think about what the equation represents. The Mott-Gurney equation comes from the theory where the space-charge effect is dominant. In that case, the current is limited by the electric field due to the charge build-up. So, it's more about the space-charge effect. Ohmic contact would imply that the injection is not a barrier—like in an ideal diode, but for SCLC, I think the assumption is that the device is single-carrier and has no significant injection barriers.

Option B: Trap-free single-carrier, no carrier injection barrier, negligible diffusion current. No injection barrier makes sense because in SCLC, the current is due to the built-in field not the injection. If there's a barrier, like a Schottky contact, that would complicate things. So for SCLC, the assumption is that the current is due to the space charge, so no injection barriers. Also, the equation is considering drift current because it's SCLC which involves the acceleration of carriers by an electric field. But if diffusion current is negligible, that's another condition. So B says negligible diffusion current. Hmm. So in the derivation of Mott-Gurney, I think they assume that the current is due to drift and that the space charge creates a field which accelerates the carriers, leading to J proportional to V squared. So maybe diffusion is not the main factor here. So if diffusion is negligible, that would fit.

Option C: Single-carrier Schottky contact, negligible diffusion. A Schottky contact implies a barrier, so the injection is not Ohmic. But wait, Mott-Gurney is about space-charge-limited current, which occurs when the injection is so limited that the space charge dominates. If there's a Schottky barrier, perhaps the injection is the limiting factor. But wait, in SCLC, the current is limited by the space charge, not the injection. So maybe the presence of a Schottky contact isn't a problem because the space charge is what's limiting the current. So I'm not sure. Also, the equation is for a single-carrier, which would be either electrons or holes, not both.

Option D: Two-carrier, Ohmic, negligible diffusion. Two-carrier devices, like p-n junctions, but Mott-Gurney is usually for single-carrier because in two-carrier, the space charge would involve both electrons and holes. The equation seems to be for a single type of carrier. So D is probably incorrect because the equation is for single-carrier.

So, going back to the options.

The Mott-Gurney equation is derived under certain assumptions. It assumes that the current is limited by the space charge, not by the injection. So, the device should have no significant injection barriers. Ohmic contacts would mean that there's no barrier, so the carriers can move without much energy needed. Also, in the derivation, I think the assumption is that the space-charge effect is dominant, which happens when the voltage is such that the space charge is building up and creating a strong electric field, leading to the velocity of the carriers being proportional to V squared.

Now, thinking about the conditions: the equation assumes a single carrier (like only electrons or holes, not both). So any option that says two-carrier is probably wrong.

So, options A, B, C are single-carrier. D is two, so D is out.

Now among A, B, and C.

Looking at the equation, it's about the space-charge-limited current. This occurs when the electric field is so strong that the space charge (built-up charge) is what's limiting the current. So, the conditions would include that the device is single-carrier, trap-free (so that the carriers are not getting stuck or scattered), and that the injection is not a problem, so the contact is Ohmic. But also, the derivation of Mott-Gurney considers drift current as dominant, and negligible diffusion. Because, in the space-charge regime, the movement is more due to drift (electric field) than diffusion (concentration gradients).

Wait, but option B says 'no carrier injection barrier' which would imply an Ohmic contact, since there's no barrier to injection. That makes sense because an Ohmic contact allows easy injection. So B is trap-free, single-carrier, no injection barrier (Ohmic contact), and negligible diffusion current. So that fits.

Option A: Ohmic contact and negligible drift current. Wait, but if drift current is negligible, then the current isn't due
