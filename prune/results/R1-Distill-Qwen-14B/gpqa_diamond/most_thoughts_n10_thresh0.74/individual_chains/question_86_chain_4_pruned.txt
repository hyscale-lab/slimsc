Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but let me try to work through it step by step. The question is about determining the correct starting materials for two reactions that lead to the same product but with different configurations.

So, the problem says that a chemist used two different reducing agents, LiBH4 and BH3, on two unknown compounds, A and B, respectively. Both reactions produce (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one respectively. Wait no, actually, looking again, Reaction 1 is A + LiBH4 + H+ giving (R) product, and Reaction 2 is B + BH3 + H+ giving (S) product. Or wait, actually, the question says that when B is treated with BH3, the product is (S)-4-ethyl...?

Wait, I think I got that mixed up. Let me recheck. The question says:

Reaction 1: A + LiBH4 + H+ → (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one

Reaction 2: B + BH3 + H+ → (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one

Wait, no, no. The question states:

"A chemist performed two reactions by taking two unknown compounds and treated them separately with two different reducing agents."

So, for reaction 1, A is treated with LiBH4 and H+ to give (R)-4-ethyl... 

For reaction 2, B is treated with BH3 and H+ to give (S)-4-ethyl... 

So, the product from A is R configuration, and from B is S? Or wait, the products are (R) and (S), but looking at the question again, the products are different. So, in the first case, the product is R, and the second is S. Wait, no, the product in each case is 4-ethyl... but with different configurations. So, the configurations of the products are R and S, but which reaction gives which?

Wait, the question says:

A + LiBH4 + H+ --> (R)-4-ethyl...

B + BH3 + H+ --> (S)-4-ethyl...

Ah, so the product from A has R configuration, and from B has S.

Now, the task is to choose which options
