Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it says. Hmm, it's about a chemist performing two reactions with two different reducing agents on unknown compounds. The products are given, and I need to determine the starting materials A and B.

The reactions are:
A + LiBH4 + H+ → (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one
B + BH3 + H+ → (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one

The options are for A and B, each being one of the four given compounds. All options have the same structure but different stereoisomer configurations.

Wait, I remember that LiBH4 and BH3 are both reducing agents, but they work differently. LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, often used in the reduction of carbonyl groups. BH3, on the other hand, is typically used in hydroboration reactions. Oh wait, but in the context of ketones or esters, maybe they're both doing reductions?

Wait, no. Wait, LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent that can reduce ketones to secondary alcohols. But BH3 is more commonly involved in hydroboration reactions, like in the formation of alkenes via the BH3-THF method, but wait, that's for alkenes. Wait, or is it more about adding boron to carbonyl groups?

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again. Oh, wait, another possibility. LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent for esters and ketones, but BH3 is used in the reduction of esters to alcohols as well? Or perhaps BH3 is part of a different reaction, like the Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley reduction, which uses BH3 to reduce ketones to secondary alcohols. Hmm, but that's a possibility.

Wait, but looking at the products, they are both 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, but one is R configuration and the other is S. So the product is a cyclic ketone, a tetrahydropyran derivative. So perhaps the starting materials are esters or something that can be reduced to form this cyclic ketone.

Wait, another thought: LiBH4 is a strong reducing
