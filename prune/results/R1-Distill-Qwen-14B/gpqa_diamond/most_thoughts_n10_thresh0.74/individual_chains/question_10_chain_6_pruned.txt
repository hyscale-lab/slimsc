Okay, so I have this question about exoplanets and their densities. Hmm, I'm a bit new to this, but let me try to think it through.

The question is asking which of the four options has the highest density. The options are a, b, c, d, each describing different exoplanets. The choices provided are A to D, each corresponding to one of the options.

Wait, I think I should read the question again carefully. The options a to d each describe a planet with certain characteristics, and I need to determine which has the highest density.

Let me list out each option again:

a) Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet.
b) 2 Earth masses, density ~5.5 g/cm続.
c) Same composition as Earth, but 5 times more massive.
d) Same composition as Earth, but half the mass.

Wait, but wait. Oh, wait, option b says the planet has 2 Earth masses and a density of 5.5 g/cm続. So for that one, the density is already given. So perhaps that's a key point.

I remember that the density of a planet is mass divided by volume. And volume depends on radius cubed. But how does the mass and radius relate for each option?

Let me think about each option one by one.

Option a: Earth's mass and radius. So Earth's density is known. Earth's density is about 5.5 g/cm続. So this planet (a) has Earth's density. So option a has density 5.5.

Option b: Mass is 2 Earth masses, and the density is given as 5.5 g/cm続. So according to this, the density is same as Earth. So if a and b both have 5.5, what's the catch?

Wait no, let me read again. Oh, option b says it's a planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5. So that's option b: density is 5.5.

Option c: same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive. Wait, but same composition implies same density, right? Because composition affects density. If a planet has the same composition as Earth, its average density should be the same as Earth's. So Earth's is 5.5, so option c's density is also 5.5. But wait, is that correct? Because if it's more massive, maybe the radius increases, but composition stays same
