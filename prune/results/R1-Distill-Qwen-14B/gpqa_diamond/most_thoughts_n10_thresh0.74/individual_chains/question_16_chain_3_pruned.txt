Okay, so I have this question about optical activity of compounds. Hmm, optical activity is when a compound can rotate plane-polarized light, which usually means it has chiral centers or some kind of asymmetry. I remember that for a compound to be chiral, it needs to have a chiral center or another feature that makes it non-superimposable on its mirror image.

Let me look at each compound one by one.

1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene
Wait, this is an alkene with substituents. The configuration is Z. But wait, does the Z configuration cause optical activity? No, I think geometric isomerism (cis-trans) doesn't make a molecule chiral on its own unless it has a chiral center or some other asymmetric element. So this is a double bond; if the substituents on both sides are the same, maybe not. Let me draw it. Structure is Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? No, wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2... Wait, no, but-1-ene would be CH2=CHCH2CH3. Wait, but in this case, it's 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. So structure is Cl-C(CH3)=CH2-CH2? Wait, maybe I should write the structure correctly. Let me think, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would be Cl attached to the first carbon, and a methyl on the second carbon. So structure is Cl-C(CH3)=CH2-CH3? No, wait, but-1-ene has four carbons: C1=C2-C3-C4. So 1-chloro would be Cl on C1, and 2-methyl would be a CH(CH3) on C2. So the structure is Cl-C(CH3)=CH2? Wait, no, but the double bond is between C1 and C2. Wait, but but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl attached to the first carbon (which is a CH2 group in the alkene). Wait, but then 2-methyl would be a CH(CH3) on the second carbon. So the structure is Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? No, that's five carbons. Wait, but but
