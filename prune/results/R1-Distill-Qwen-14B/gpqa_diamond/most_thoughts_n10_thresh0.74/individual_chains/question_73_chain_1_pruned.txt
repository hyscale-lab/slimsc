Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm, relativistic speeds... right, that means I need to consider special relativity, not classical mechanics. I remember that at speeds close to light speed, things get a bit tricky with velocities and energies.

The problem says the two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c, both in the positive x-direction. Wait, so they're moving in the same direction. The question is asking for two things: the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

Wait, relative speed. Oh right, in relativity, you can't just subtract velocities like you do in classical mechanics. I think the formula for velocity addition is different. Let me recall. The relativistic velocity addition formula is (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/c²), right? Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, that's when you're moving at u relative to an observer, and another object is moving at v in the same direction. So the relative speed would be (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/(c²)).

Wait, no, wait again. Let me get this straight. If object A is moving at speed u relative to the observer, and object B is moving at speed v in the same direction as A, then from A's perspective, the speed of B would be (v - u)/(1 - (u v)/c²). Or wait, maybe it's (u' = (v - u) / (1 - (u v)/c²))? Hmm, I think so. So in this case, the first astronaut (mass 2m) is moving at 0.6c, and the second (3m) at 0.5c in the same direction. So the relative speed of the second astronaut from the first's frame would be (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c²). Let me compute that.

Wait, actually, wait. The problem says "relative speed" but I'm not sure which one is being considered the reference. Oh, wait, the question is about the relative speed between them. So if astronaut 1 is moving at 0.6c and astronaut 2 at 0.5c in the same direction, then from astronaut 1's frame, astronaut 2 is moving slower. So the relative speed would be (0.5c - 0.6c) divided by (1 - (0.6c *0.5c)/c²). Let me compute the numerator first: 0.5 - 0.6 = -0.1, so negative 0.1c. The denominator is 1 - (0.3c²)/c², which is 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So the relative speed is (-0.1c)/(0.7) = -0.142857... c. But since speed is a magnitude, maybe we take the absolute value. So approximately 0.14c. Hmm, so that's about 0.14c. Looking at the options, option C and D have 0.14c for the relative speed.

Wait, but wait. Another way to think about this: if both are moving in the same direction, the relative speed is the difference of their
