Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because NMR can be tricky. Let's see what the question says.

The problem states that I've prepared a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound with 8 carbons in total. The FTIR shows a carbonyl group (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond. I need to find the correct 1H NMR data from the options given.

Hmm, di-substituted aromatic ring. So that's two substituents on the benzene ring. The total carbons being 8 might help figure out the structure. Let's think about possible structures.

First, the substituents: one is a carbonyl group, which could be a ketone, aldehyde, or maybe an ester or something else. But wait, if the carbonyl is in the ring, maybe it's a ketone like acetophenone? Or perhaps it's an acyl group attached as a substituent.

The other substituent is a halogen attached to the aromatic ring. Oh wait, noâ€”the FTIR says aromatic-halogen bond, so the substituent is a halide directly attached to the ring, like Cl, Br, etc. So the ring has two substituents: one is a halogen, the other is a carbonyl-containing group.

Wait, but wait. The compound is di-substituted and has 8 carbons total. Benzene is 6 carbons, so the substituents add 2 carbons
