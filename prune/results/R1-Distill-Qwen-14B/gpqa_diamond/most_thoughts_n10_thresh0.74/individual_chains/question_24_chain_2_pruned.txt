Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

The question is about some mixtures of liquids undergoing reactions, and I need to find the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. Hmm, let's read the problem again carefully.

So, mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that can decolorize bromine water. Wait, decolorizing bromine water usually means the substance has unsaturation, like alkenes or alkynes, which can add across the double bond in Br2. Since X has two liquids and they're equimolar, maybe they're each a different type of unsaturated compound.

Then, when X is treated with platinum and heated, it undergoes a reaction to form mixture Y. Y is a result of a disproportionation reaction, which means one substance is both oxidized and reduced. Y is an equimolar mixture of two other liquids that don't decolorize bromine water. If Y's liquids don't decolorize bromine, they must be saturated, meaning no double or triple bonds. So Y might consist of alkanes or other saturated compounds.

Hydrogenation of both X and Y with platinum under severe conditions gives only one substance Z, which is a hydrocarbon. Z has a mass fraction of hydrogen as 14.28%. Let me calculate that. 14.28% is approximately 1/7, since 14.28 is roughly 100 divided by 7. So the mass of hydrogen is 1/7, which would mean that the molecular formula of Z is CnHm, with the fraction (m/(12n + m)) = 1/7.

Wait, let's do the math. The mass fraction of hydrogen in Z is 14.28%, which is 0.1428. That is 1/7 because 1/7 is approximately 0.142857. So:

Hydrogen mass fraction = (mass of H) / (molar mass of Z) = 1/7.

Let me let the molar mass of Z be M. So:

M = (mass of H) + (mass of C). Since hydrogen contributes 1/7 of M, then the remaining 6/7 is carbon. So,

M = (1/7) * M + (6/7)*M.

Wait, that's just restating it. Let me think about the formula. Let's say Z has a molecular formula of CnHm. The molar mass would be 12n + m. The mass of hydrogen is m * 1 = m g/mol. So:

(m) / (12n + m) = 1/7.

Cross-multiplying:

7m = 12n + m → 6m = 12n → m = 2n.

So the formula is CnH2n. That's the formula of an alkene, but wait, no. Wait, CnH2n is alkenes, but if Z is a product of hydrogenation, it must be more saturated. Oh, but wait, Z is the result of hydrogenation of both X and Y. So X and Y could have double bonds, but after hydrogenation, they form Z. If X and Y are being hydrogenated to give Z, which is a hydrocarbon, and Z has the formula CnH2n, that suggests that Z is an alkene? But that can't be right because hydrogenation usually adds H2 across double or triple bonds to make single bonds. Wait, no, wait. If Z is the product of hydrogenation, then Z would be more saturated, meaning it's an alkane. Because if X or Y had double bonds, hydrogenation would add H2, turning them into single bonds.

Wait, but according to the calculation, Z's formula is CnH2n. Alkanes have the formula CnH2n+2. So why is Z CnH2n? Unless I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check again.

Hydrogen mass fraction is 14.28%, which is 1/7. So:

(m) / (12n + m) = 1/7 → 7m = 12n + m → 6m =12n → m=2n.

So it's CnH2n. Hmm, but that's an alkene or alkyne. But wait, Z is a constituent of Y, and Y doesn't have any double bonds because its liquids don't decolorize bromine. So perhaps Z is in Y, but Y doesn't have double bonds—so how can Z have a double bond? That doesn't make sense. Wait, no, Y is the result of a disproportionation, so perhaps it's a mixture of an oxidized and a reduced form. Hmm, maybe I'm getting ahead of
