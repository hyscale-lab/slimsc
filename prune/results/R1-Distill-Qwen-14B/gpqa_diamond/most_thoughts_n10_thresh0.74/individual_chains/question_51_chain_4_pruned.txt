Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the potential energy of a charge placed near a grounded conducting sphere. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on electrostatics, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, the problem says a charge q is placed a distance d away from the center of a grounded conducting sphere with radius R. I need to find the net potential energy of the system. The options are given, so maybe I can figure it out by recalling some concepts.

First, I remember that when a charge is placed near a conductor, the conductor responds by inducing charges on its surface. Since the sphere is grounded, any induced charges on the sphere will adjust accordingly. Wait, the sphere is conducting and grounded, so the induced charges would redistribute. But wait, for a conducting sphere, the charges reside on the surface, right?

Wait, but when you have a charge outside a conductor, the conductor's induced charges arrange themselves to make the interior field zero. So the electric field inside the conductor is zero. But how does this affect the potential?

Oh, right, the potential inside a conductor is constant. So the potential on the surface of the sphere is the same as the potential it would have if it were isolated. But wait, in this case, the sphere is grounded, which means it's connected to earth, so the potential at the surface is zero? Or is it that the potential is the same as the earth's potential, which we take as zero?

Hmm, maybe I should think about the method of images here. Oh wait, that's a technique used for finding the potential due to a charge near a conductor by considering image charges. For a conducting sphere, the image charge would be placed somewhere else.

Wait, but
