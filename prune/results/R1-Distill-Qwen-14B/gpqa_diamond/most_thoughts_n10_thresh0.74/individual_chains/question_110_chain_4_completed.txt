Okay, let me try to figure out which stars can be detected by both ESPRESSO and HIRES. So, the question is about which stars are observable with both spectrographs based on their apparent magnitudes.

First, I need to recall the information given. ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. That means any star with V mag ≤ 17 can be detected by ESPRESSO. HIRES, on the other hand, can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag. So, HIRES can detect stars with V mag ≤ 16.

Wait, wait, but wait. Oh right, the brighter the star, the smaller the magnitude number. So, a star that's magnitude 16 is dimmer than one that's 15. So, ESPRESSO can handle up to 17, which is dimmer than what HIRES can handle (up to 16). So for a star to be detected by both, it must have an apparent V magnitude less than or equal to 16, because HIRES can't go beyond 16. So the star must be brighter than 16 mag (since 16 is the limit for HIRES), but wait, no—wait, the stars have V magnitudes, and "brighter than" here—wait, the description says "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed with ESPRESSO." Oh wait, no, that's the opposite. Because a lower magnitude means brighter. So if a star is brighter than 17, it would have a magnitude less than 17. So, for example, a magnitude 16 is brighter than 17.

So, the maximum magnitude that ESPRESSO can observe is 17. So any star with V mag ≤ 17 can be detected by ESPRESSO. HIRES can observe stars with V mag ≤16. So for a star to be detected by both, its V mag must be ≤16. Because if it's 17, HIRES can't see it.

So the key is to find stars that have apparent V magnitude ≤16. So let's look at each star.

Star1: Absolute magnitude is given as 15.5, located at 10 pc. So apparent magnitude would be absolute magnitude plus distance modulus. The distance modulus is 5 log (d/10) where d is in parsecs. For 10 pc, it's 5*(1) =5. So apparent mag is 15.5 +5=20.5. So V=20.5 which is way above both 17 and 16. So Star1 can't be detected by either. So it's out.

Star2: Apparent V mag is 16.5 mag. So that's 16.5, which is higher than 16. HIRES can only do up to 16. So Star2's apparent mag is 16.5 which is too faint for HIRES. But ESPRESSO can go up to 17, so Star2 would be detected by ESPRESSO but not by HIRES. So Star2 can't be detected by both. So Star2 is out.

Star3: Apparent V mag is 15.5, but wait, wait. Wait a second. Oh, no. Wait, Star3's parameters: apparent V mag is 15.5? Or is the absolute magnitude given? Let me check. Oh, the question says Star3 has apparent V mag 15.5. Wait, no, wait: Star3's description: apparent V magnitude of 15.5, and E(B-V)=0.6. Oh, so apparent V mag is 15.5, but wait, I think this is the observed magnitude. But wait, the E(B-V) is the color excess, which is used to calculate the extinction (absorption) in the V band. So the total absorption A_V is E(B-V) multiplied by 3.1. So A_V = 0.6 * 3.1 = 1.86 mag.

So the observed apparent magnitude (m) is the intrinsic magnitude (M) plus distance modulus plus extinction. Wait no, no, wait. Wait, Star3's apparent V mag is given as 15.5, but that's probably the observed magnitude. But wait, no, wait: No, the apparent magnitude as observed is m_observed. But if there's extinction, the star's true (intrinsic) magnitude would be m_true = m_observed - A_v. Wait, no, because when light is absorbed, the star appears dimmer, so the observed magnitude is higher than the intrinsic. So m_observed = m_true + A_v, where m_true is the star's apparent magnitude without extinction. So Star3's given apparent V is 15.5, but that's already including the extinction. Oh wait, no. Wait, the question says, "apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag" but with E(B-V)=0.6. So perhaps the 15.5 is the observed magnitude, which includes extinction. So to find the intrinsic apparent magnitude (what it would be without extinction), we subtract A_V.

Wait, no. If E(B-V) is the color excess, which is E = B-V observed - B-V intrinsic. The total extinction in V band is A_V = 3.1 * E(B-V). So A_V = 3.1 * 0.6 =1.86.

So the observed apparent magnitude is m_observed = m_intrinsic + A_V.

So the observed m is 15.5, so m_intrinsic is 15.5 -1.86 = 13.64.

Wait, but why would we care about the intrinsic magnitude? Because the star's actual brightness is m_intrinsic, but when observed, it's dimmer by A_V. But when considering whether the star is detectable, it's the observed magnitude that matters. Because the spectrographs see the observed light. So if the observed magnitude is 15.5, then for ESPRESSO, which can go up to 17, 15.5 is within the limit. Similarly, for HIRES, which can go up to 16. So 15.5 is less than 16, so Star3 would be detected by both.

Wait, but the question is about which stars can be detected with both. So Star3's apparent mag is 15.5, so both can detect it.

Star4: Absolute magnitude is 15.5, located at 10 pc. So apparent magnitude: M_abs = 15.5. Distance modulus is 5*log(10/10) = 0. So apparent mag is 15.5. But wait, but Star4 also has E(B-V)=0.4. So A_V = 3.1 *0.4 =1.24.

So the observed apparent magnitude m_observed = m_intrinsic + A_V. So m_intrinsic is the star's intrinsic apparent magnitude. Wait, but the star's absolute magnitude is given, which is the apparent magnitude at 10 pc. Since the star is at 10 pc, its apparent magnitude is same as its absolute magnitude, which is 15.5. So without extinction, m_apparent would be 15.5. But with extinction, m_observed is 15.5 +1.24=16.74.

So the observed apparent magnitude is 16.74, which is higher than both 16 (HIRES limit) and 17 (ESPRESSO limit). So Star4's observed mag is 16.74, which is beyond both. So Star4 can't be detected by either. So Star4 is out.

Star5: Absolute magnitude is 16.5, located at 5 pc. So distance modulus is 5 * log(5/10) = 5 * log(0.5) =5*(-0.3010) ≈-1.505. So apparent magnitude is M_abs + distance modulus: 16.5 + (-1.505)=14.995. So without considering extinction, m is ~15.0.

But wait, does Star5 have extinction? The description says Star5 has absolute V mag 16.5, located at 5 pc. No mention of E(B-V). So I think E(B-V) is zero for Star5. So m =15.0. So observed magnitude is 15.0, which is within both ESPRESSO's 17 and HIRES's 16. So Star5 would be detected by both.

Now, let's recap each star:

Star1: apparent mag 20.5 → can't be detected by either.

Star2: apparent mag 16.5 → detected by ESPRESSO but not HIRES.

Star3: apparent mag 15.5 → detected by both.

Star4: apparent mag 16.74 → can't be detected by either.

Star5: apparent mag 15.0 → detected by both.

Wait, but wait. Star3's apparent mag is 15.5, which is within both. Star5's is 15.0, which is also within both. So which options include these?

Looking at the options:

Option A) Star4 and Star5 → Star4 can't be detected.

Option B) Star3 and Star5 → Both can be detected. So this is a possible option.

Option C) Star2 and Star3 → Star2 can't be detected by HIRES.

Option D) Star1 and Star4 → Neither can be detected.

Wait, but wait. Wait, what about Star3 and Star5?

Wait, Star3's observed magnitude is 15.5, which is below 17 (ESPRESSO can see it) and below 16 (HIRES can see it). So yes, both can detect Star3.

Star5's observed mag is 15.0, which is within both.

So the stars that can be detected by both are Star3 and Star5. So the correct option is B) Star3 and Star5.

Wait, but looking back at the options, option B is Star3 and Star5. Let me confirm:

Star3: observed V mag 15.5 → yes, both can detect.

Star5: observed V mag 15.0 → yes, both can detect.

So the correct answer is option B.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check Star3's calculation.

Star3 has apparent V mag 15.5, but wait, the given is the observed magnitude, which includes extinction. Because the apparent V mag is given as 15.5, and E(B-V) is given as 0.6. So when considering whether it's detectable, it's the observed magnitude that matters, because that's what the spectrographs see. So Star3's m is 15.5. So both spectrographs can see it.

Star4's observed mag is 16.74, which is beyond both. So Star4 is out.

So the stars that satisfy the condition are Star3 and Star5. So the correct option is B.


To determine which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at the Paranal Observatory and the HIRES spectrograph at the Keck Observatory, we analyze the apparent V magnitudes of the stars. ESPRESSO can observe stars with apparent V magnitudes ≤ 17, while HIRES can observe stars with apparent V magnitudes ≤ 16. Therefore, a star must have an apparent V magnitude ≤ 16 to be detectable by both spectrographs.

### Analysis of Each Star:

3. **Star3**:  
   - Apparent V magnitude = 15.5, E(B-V) = 0.6.  
   - Total extinction in the V band: \( A_V = 3.1 \times E(B-V) = 3.1 \times 0.6 = 1.86 \).  
   - Observed apparent V magnitude = 15.5 + 1.86 = 17.36.  
   - **Conclusion**: Star3 has an apparent V magnitude > 16, so it cannot be detected by HIRES, though it can be detected by ESPRESSO.
