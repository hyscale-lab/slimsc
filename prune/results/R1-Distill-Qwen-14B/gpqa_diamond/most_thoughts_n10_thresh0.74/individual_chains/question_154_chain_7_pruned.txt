Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the answer. Let me start by reading through the question carefully.

The question describes a scenario where a chemist finds an unnamed white solid in the lab. He uses some spectral data to identify it. The data provided includes mass, IR, and 1H NMR spectra. The options given are four different compounds, and I have to pick the right one based on the information.

Let me break down each piece of data and see what they tell me.

First, the mass spectrum: the molecular ion peak is at m/z 156 (100%). There's another peak at m/z 158 (32%). Hmm, the molecular ion is at 156. So the molecular weight is 156 g/mol. The other peak at 158 is 32% abundance. Since 158 is two units higher than 156, that suggests a possible isotopic peak or some sort of fragment that's two mass units higher. Wait, but isotopic peaks are usually for elements like Cl or maybe Br. Chlorine has an atomic weight around 35 and 37, so if the molecule has a Cl, the molecular ion would have peaks at m/z 156 and 158, depending on the Cl's presence. Let me think: chlorine has about 75% abundance for Cl-35 and 25% for Cl-37. So if the molecular formula includes one Cl, the molecular ion would have two peaks: one at 156 (Cl-35) and one at 158 (Cl-37). The 32% abundance at 158 suggests maybe double Cl? Because 25% of 25% would be 6.25%, but wait, that's probably not it. Wait, no, the 32% is the intensity of the peak, which is lower than 100% for the 156. Hmm, so maybe it's a fragment. Alternatively, perhaps the molecular formula includes an oxygen, which could lead to some fragment with O, but I'm not sure yet.

Moving on to the IR data: a broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1. Broad peaks in that region usually indicate O-H or N-H stretches. A strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1. That's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. 1720 is a typical region for esters, ketones, maybe aldehydes? Wait, aldehydes usually have higher wavenumbers, like around 1700-1720. Wait, but sometimes they can be a bit higher. Wait, no, more accurately, maybe it's an ester or a carboxylic acid. Let me think: carboxylic acids have a broad O-H stretch around 3000-2500, which would fit the broad peak here. But wait, the peak is broad from 3500-2700. That's a wide range, which suggests a strong hydrogen bond, like in a carboxylic acid. But wait, the IR also shows a strong sharp
