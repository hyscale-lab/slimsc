Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it. Let me see what the question is about.

Alright, the state of the system is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). So that's a vector in three dimensions, I think. The observable is represented by the matrix P. The question is about finding the probability that measuring P will give 0.

Wait, quantum mechanics, right. Observables are represented by Hermitian operators, and their eigenvalues are the possible measurement outcomes. So I think to find the probability of getting a particular eigenvalue, like 0 here, I need to find the eigenvectors corresponding to eigenvalue 0 of the operator P, and then compute the projection of the state onto that eigenspace.

Let me write down the matrix P first. The first row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0), second row is (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), third row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). Hmm, so P is a 3x3 matrix.

Wait, but I'm not sure if P is Hermitian. Let me check. For a matrix to be Hermitian, the elements must satisfy P_ij = P_ji^*. Let's see. The (1,2) element is 1/sqrt(2). The (2,1) element is 1/sqrt(2), which is equal since it's real. Similarly, (1,3) is 0, (3,1) is 0. (2,3) is 1/sqrt(2), and (3,2) is 1/sqrt(2), same. So P is indeed Hermitian, which makes sense because it's an observable.

Now, the eigenvalues of P will be the possible outcomes. We're interested in the eigenvalue 0. So I need to find the eigenvectors corresponding to 0, and then compute the inner product of the state vector with these eigenvectors.

Wait, but how do I find the eigenvalues of P? Let me set up the characteristic equation. The determinant of (P - λI) should be zero.

So P is:

[ 0        1/sqrt(2)    0        ]
[1/sqrt(2)  0         1/sqrt(2) ]
[ 0        1/sqrt(2)  0        ]

So the matrix (P - λI) is:

[ -λ      1/sqrt(2)    0      ]
[1/sqrt(2)  -λ        1/sqrt(2) ]
[ 0      1/sqrt(2)   -λ      ]

Calculating the determinant of this 3x3 matrix. Let me write it out:

| -λ      a           0      |
| a      -λ           a      |
| 0       a         -λ      |

Where a is 1/sqrt(2). The determinant of this matrix would be:

-λ * [ (-λ)(-λ) - a^2 ] - a * [ a*(-λ) - a*0 ] + 0 * [...] 

Wait, let's compute it more carefully. The determinant can be expanded along the first row.

So:

-λ * det [ [-λ, a], [a, -λ] ] 
- a * det [ [a, a], [0, -λ] ] 
+ 0 * something.

So first term: -λ * [ (-λ)*(-λ) - a^2 ] = -λ (λ² - a² )

Second term: -a * [ a*(-λ) - a*0 ] = -a * (-a λ) = a² λ

So the determinant is:

-λ (λ² - a²) + a² λ.

Let's factor that:

-λ^3 + λ a² + a² λ = -λ^3 + 2a² λ.

Set this equal to zero for eigenvalues:

-λ^3 + 2a² λ = 0
λ (-λ² + 2a²) = 0

So the solutions are λ=0, and λ² = 2a² → λ = ± a*sqrt(2).

Wait, but a is 1/sqrt(2). So 2a² is 2*(1/2) )=1. So λ² = 1 → λ= ±1.

Wait no, wait. Let me compute a squared: a² = (1/sqrt(2))² = 1/2.

So 2a² = 2*(1/2) = 1. So λ²=1, so λ=±1.

So the eigenvalues are 0, +1, -1.

Wait, but in the problem, the observable is represented by matrix P. So the possible measurement outcomes are 0, 1, and -1.

But the question is asking about the probability of getting 0. So the eigenvalue 0 is one of the possibilities.

So the eigenvectors corresponding to λ=0 will form a subspace, and the probability is the square of the norm of the projection of the state onto this subspace.

So we need to find the eigenvectors when λ=0.

Let's substitute λ=0 into the matrix (P - 0*I) = P.

So the homogeneous system is P v = 0.

So the system of equations is:

Row 1: 0*v1 + (1/sqrt(2)) v2 + 0*v3 = 0 → v2 =0.

Row 2: (1/sqrt(2)) v1 + 0*v2 + (1/sqrt(2)) v3 = 0 → v1 + v3 = 0.

Row 3: 0*v1 + (1/sqrt(2)) v2 + 0*v3 =0 → v2=0.

So from row 1 and 3, v2 is zero. From row 2, v1 = -v3.

So the eigenvectors are of the form (v1, 0, v3) where v1= -v3. Let's express this as a vector: v = [v1, 0, -v1]^T.

We can choose v1 as a parameter, say v1 = t. Then the eigenvector is t*(1, 0, -1)^T.

So the eigenspace for λ=0 is one-dimensional, spanned by (1,0,-1).

Wait,
