Okay, so I have this question about rotavirus and some experiments done on it. Let me try to unpack what's going on here.

The setup is that they've tagged the inner capsid proteins of rotavirus with GFP. Then, they delivered these to mice via oral gavage. So, the mice swallowed it, right? Then they did in vivo imaging and saw some fluorescence destroyed by stomach acid. Hmm, I remember that the stomach has a lot of acid, which can break down proteins. So, maybe some of the GFP-tagged proteins didn't survive the trip through the stomach.

Then, some were entangled in the intestinal mucus before reaching the secondary lymphoid organs. Secondary lymphoid organs are like places where immune responses happen, like Peyer's patches, lymph nodes, etc. So the ones that made it through the stomach acid and mucus probably reached these areas.

They identified fluorescent Peyer patches. Peyer patches are one of the places where immune cells, especially B cells, are found. So the rotavirus proteins must have gotten there somehow.

They isolated the proliferating cell population and sequenced their variable heavy chain genes. High variability was observed. So, the cells are proliferating, and their variable regions are changing a lot. That makes me think of immune processes that cause diversification of antibodies.

Looking at the options:

A) Somatic hypermutation: This process occurs in B cells during the immune response. It's a way to increase the diversity of antibodies by mutating the variable regions of the heavy and light chains. This happens after the initial response, like during the germinal center reactions, leading to affinity maturation.

B) Complement activation: This is part of the innate immune response, helping to tag pathogens for destruction. I don't see how this directly causes high variability in the variable regions.

C) Class switching recombination: This is when the class of antibody (like from IgM to IgG) changes. It doesn't directly cause variability in the variable regions but changes the type of antibody produced.

D) VDJ recombination: This is the process that happens during B cell development in the bone marrow, where the variable, diversity, and joining genes are recombined to form the heavy chain. But this happens early on, not during the immune response. So if they're seeing high variability after exposure, it's probably not VDJ again.

In the scenario, after the GFP-tagged proteins reach the Peyer patches (which are part of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue), the B cells there are proliferating. The high variability in the variable regions suggests that each B cell is producing a slightly different antibody. This sounds like somatic hypermutation, which occurs in the germinal centers where B cells undergo this mutation to increase the chances of producing a more effective antibody.

So option A, somatic hypermutation, must be the process happening here.


The experiment involves tagging rotavirus inner capsid proteins with GFP and delivering them to mice via oral gavage. Some fluorescence is destroyed by stomach acid, and some are entangled in intestinal mucus before reaching secondary lymphoid organs like Peyer patches. Fluorescent Peyer patches are identified, and the proliferating cell population is isolated. Sequencing their variable heavy chain genes reveals high variability, indicating a process that diversifies antibodies.

- **Option A (somatic hypermutation):** This process occurs in B cells during immune responses, particularly in germinal centers, where the variable regions of antibody genes are mutated to increase diversity. This matches the observed high variability in the variable heavy chain genes.
- **Option B (complement activation):** This is part of the innate immune response and does not directly cause variability in the variable regions of antibodies.
- **Option C (class switching recombination):** This changes the class of antibody (e.g., from IgM to IgG) but does not increase variability in the variable regions.
- **Option D (VDJ recombination):** This occurs during early B cell development in the bone marrow and is not relevant to the observed variability after immune exposure.

The high variability in the variable heavy chain genes observed in the proliferating B cells in the Peyer patches is consistent with somatic hypermutation, a process that diversifies antibodies during immune responses.

Answer: A
