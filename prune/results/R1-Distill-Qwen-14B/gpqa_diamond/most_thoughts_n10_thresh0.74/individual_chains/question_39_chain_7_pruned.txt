Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me read it again and try to figure it out step by step. 

The problem says we have a large number of identical systems, each with a particle that can move along a tube, which is along the x-axis. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) minus 0.5i. The experiment shows that when they measured the position, none of the particles were found at x less than 1 or x greater than 3. So all the particles are between x=1 and x=3. 

Wait, that's interesting. So the wave function must be zero outside this region, right? Because if the wave function is zero, the probability of finding the particle there is zero. So the wave function must be zero when x is less than 1 and greater than 3. But wait, the given wave function isn't zero in those regions. Oh, I need to think about that.

Wait, maybe the wave function is only non-zero between x=1 and x=3. So perhaps it's zero outside that interval, but the given expression is valid where it's non-zero. Or maybe the given wave function is the part that's non-zero, and it's zero elsewhere. Hmm, but the question says "in a part of space where it can exist." So maybe the wave function is given in the region where it's non-zero. 

So the wave function is ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. But wait, the wave function in quantum mechanics is a complex function, but when we calculate probabilities, we need the square of the absolute value. So the probability density is |ψ(x)|². 

But wait, the given wave function is (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Let me represent this as ψ(x) = (a/sqrt(1+x)) + (-0.5)i. So the real part is a/(sqrt(1+x)) and the imaginary part is -0.5. 

Wait a minute, that's interesting. Because the probability density is |ψ|^2 = [ (a/sqrt(1+x))² + (0.5)^2 ] . So that's [a²/(1+x)] + 0.25. 

But wait, the wave function must satisfy the normalization condition. The integral of |ψ(x)|² from x=1 to x=3 must equal 1
