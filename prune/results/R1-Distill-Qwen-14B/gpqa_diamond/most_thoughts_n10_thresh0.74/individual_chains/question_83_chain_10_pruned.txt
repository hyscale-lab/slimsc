Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to work through it step by step.

The problem says we have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid, and we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate that solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given as A to D.

First, I think I should find out the initial concentration of the acetic acid after dilution. Because when you mix two solutions, the concentration changes based on the dilution formula.

So, the initial volume is 20 cm³, and we add another 20 cm³ of water. So the total volume is 40 cm³. The initial moles of acetic acid (CH3COOH) can be calculated by Molarity × Volume. But wait, the units need to be consistent. Molarity is in moles per liter, so the volume should be in liters.

Wait, 20 cm³ is 0.02 liters. So moles of acetic acid initially is 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 moles.

After adding 20 cm³, the total volume is 40 cm³, which is 0.04 liters. So the new concentration is moles / volume. So 0.001 moles / 0.04 L = 0.025 M. Oh, that's right, so the diluted solution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Now, when titrating with NaOH, which is a strong base, the reaction is: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COONa + H2O. The equivalence point is when the moles of NaOH added equal the moles of acetic acid.

Wait, the volume of the diluted solution is 40 cm³. So the moles of acetic acid are 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 moles. So at equivalence, we need 0.001 moles of NaOH
