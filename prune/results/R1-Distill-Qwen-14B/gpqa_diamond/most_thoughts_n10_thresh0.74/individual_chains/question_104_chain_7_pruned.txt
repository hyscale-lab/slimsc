Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy question about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, I remember that the RV method measures the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravitational pull. The shift tells us about the planet's presence and some of its properties.

The question says there are two stars with the same masses as each other and similar to the Sun. Each has a planet with Neptune-like mass. Both planets have circular orbits, which probably simplifies things because eccentricity might complicate the calculations.

Planet #1 causes a 5 milliangstrom (that's 5e-3 angstrom) shift in the spectral line. Planet #2 causes a 7 milliangstrom shift. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1.

Wait, I'm a bit rusty on the RV method formulas. I think the formula involves the velocity semi-amplitude, which is related to the Doppler shift. Oh right, the RV semi-amplitude K is given by the formula:

K = (v) = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(1/3) ) )^(1/3) ) * (1 / ( (1 + M_p/M_*) )^(1/3) )

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the formula for the semi-amplitude of the star's velocity. The formula is:

K = ( (2πG) / (P * (1 - e²)^(3/2)) ) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) )

But since the planets have similar masses to Neptune and the stars are solar mass, M_p is much less than M_*, so M_* + M_p ≈ M_*, which is the mass of the star.

Given that, we can approximate K as proportional to (M_p) / (M_*^(1/3)) * (1 / P^(1/3)).

Wait, wait, maybe I should get this more clearly. Let's think about the simplified version. The RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = ( (27 * pi * G) / (4 * c^3) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) * (1 / (P^(1/3) * sqrt(1 - e²)) )

But for circular orbits, e=0, so sqrt(1 - e²)=1. And since M_p is much less than M_*, M_* + M_p ≈ M_*, so:

K ≈ ( (27 pi G) / (4 c^3) )^(1/3) * ( M_p ) / ( M_*^(2/3) ) * (1 / P^(1/3) )

Wait, but G is the gravitational constant, c is speed of light. Hmm, but perhaps there's a simpler way. Wait, maybe the formula can be rearranged in terms of the Doppler shift. Oh right, because the Doppler shift is directly proportional to the velocity K. So a larger K (higher velocity) would mean a more massive planet or a shorter period, given same star mass.

Wait, but in this problem, the two stars have the same mass, so M_* is the same for both. And the planets have similar masses, so M_p is the same for both. So if M_p and M_* are the same, then K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). Because K ∝ 1 / P^(1/3). So if K1 is for planet #1 and K2 is for planet #2, then K1 = (constant) / P1^(1/3), K2 = (constant) / P2^(1/3).

So K1 / K2 = (P2 / P1)^(1/3). Or, rearranged, (K1/K2) = (P2/P1)^(1/3).

Wait, wait, wait. Because K
