Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this astronomy problem here. Let me read through it again.

So, the question is about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. There are two stars with the same mass as our Sun, and each has a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. 

Planet #1 causes a 5 milliangstrom shift in the spectral line, and Planet #2 causes a 7 milliangstrom shift. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1.

Hmm, I remember that the RV method measures the Doppler shift of the star's spectral lines due to the planet's gravitational pull. The shift tells us about the star's velocity moving towards or away from us. 

Wait, the formula I think is related to the velocity semi-amplitude. Oh right, the formula for the RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( (G * (M_planet) ) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) ) )^(1/3) ) * (1 / (P * (1 day in seconds)^(-1)) )

Wait, no, maybe it's better to think in terms of the formula that connects the velocity semi-amplitude K with the orbital period P, the mass of the planet (or the star?), and other factors.

Let me recall the correct formula. The radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ (G * (M_planet) ) / ( (M_star + M_planet) )^(1/3) ) ] * (1 / (P * (1 - e²)^(3/2)) )

But since the orbits are circular, e is zero, so the denominator becomes 1. Also, I think M_planet is much smaller than M_star (since planets are much less massive than stars), so M_star + M_planet ≈ M_star. So the formula simplifies.

Wait, but in this problem, both planets have similar masses to Neptune, but the stars are like the Sun. So M_planet is much less than M_star, so M_star + M_planet ≈ M_star. So the formula can be approximated as K ≈ ( (G * M_planet) / (M_star) )^(1/3) * (1 / (P * ( (1 day in seconds ) ) ) )^(1/3) )

Wait, perhaps it's better to use the formula for K in terms of the orbital period P, the mass of the planet M_p, the mass of the star M_s, and the orbital radius a.

Wait, another approach: the RV method relates the velocity of the star's orbit to the planet's orbit. The formula for K is given by:

K = (v) = ( (2π G) / (c P) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / (M_s + M_p)^(2/3)

But since M_p is much smaller than M_s, this simplifies to approximately:

K ≈ ( (2π G) / (c P) )^(1/3) * (M_p) / (M_s)^(2/3)

But wait, I might be mixing up the exponents. Alternatively, another version of the formula is:

K = ( (G * (M_p
