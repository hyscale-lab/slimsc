Alright, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Okay, the question is about two planets transiting and occulting a star. Hmm, I remember that when a planet transits, it passes in front of the star from our point of view, and when it occults, the planet is behind the star, so the starlight blocks the planet's light. Both events require the planets to be in the same orbital plane and their orbits to be aligned in such a way that they pass in front and behind the star.

The first planet has a radius of 1 Earth radius. Its orbit has an impact parameter of 0.2, and it's around a star that's 1.5 times the Sun's radius. Its orbital period is 3 days. The second planet has a radius 2.5 times Earth's. We need to find the maximum orbital period this second planet can have while still showing both transit and occultation events.

Wait, maximum orbital period... So, the orbital period would affect the speed of the planet. If the period is longer, the planet is moving slower in its orbit. But for both transit and occultation to happen, the second planet must pass in front and behind the star relative to our line of sight.

I think the key here is the requirement that the second planet's orbit must allow for such alignment. For both events to occur, the second planet's orbit must be such that at some point, it's inside the orbit of the first planet, right? Or wait, maybe it's the other way around. Or perhaps it's about the timing of their orbits relative to each other.

Wait, perhaps the concept of the "Hill sphere" is relevant here, but maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the synchronization of their orbital periods is important. Or maybe it's about the relative sizes and their orbital distances.

Wait, transit and occultation events happen when the planet is in front of the star (transit) and when it's behind (occultation). But for both to happen, the planet must orbit such that it can be in both positions relative to the star and our line of sight.

But in this case, the first planet already has a period of 3 days, and the second has a longer period. Wait, but how does the orbital period relate to the distance from the star? Oh right, Kepler's third law comes into play here.

Kepler's third law says that the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of the orbit. The formula is P^2 = (4π²/G(M+m)) * a^3, but since the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's, we can simplify it to P² ∝ a³. So, if we have two planets, their periods squared relate to the cube of their orbital radii.

But in this scenario, both planets are orbiting the same star. So, we can set up a ratio between their periods and their semi-major axes.

First, let's find the semi-major axis of the first planet. The first planet's period is 3 days. Wait, but the formula usually uses years for period and astronomical units (AU) for distance when using the version where P² = a³ when P is in years and a in AU. But here, the period is in days, so maybe I should convert it to years.

Wait, 3 days is about 3/365 ≈ 0.008219 years. Let me compute that properly. Let me see, 365 days per year, so 3/365 = 0.008219 years.

So, for the first planet, P1 = 3 days = 0.008219 years. Using Kepler's third law: P1^2 = a1^3 / (Mstar), but since we're dealing with the same star for both planets, the Mstar term is the same, so we can take the ratio.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The correct form is P^2 = (4π² * a³) / (G(M + m)), but since M (the star's mass) is much larger than m (planet mass), we can approximate it as P² ≈ (a³) * (4π² / G M). For the same star, G and M are the same, so P² is proportional to a³.

So, for planet 1 and planet 2, we have P1² / P2² = (a1/a2)^3.

But wait, the question is about the maximum period P2 of the second planet such that both transit and occultation events occur. Hmm.

Now, why do the periods matter for these events? Oh, because for both events to happen, the second planet must come into the line of sight in front and behind the star. So, perhaps the two planets must be in a configuration where one is inside the orbit of the other, such that when the first planet transits, the second is behind, and vice versa.

Alternatively, perhaps it's about the requirement
