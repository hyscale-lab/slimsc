Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it again.

The setup is an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R. Inside it, there's a small spherical cavity, not at the center but somewhere off-center. The center of the cavity is a distance s away from the center of the conductor. The radius of the cavity is r, and they say r is less than R. So the cavity is entirely inside the conductor.

Now, a small positive charge +q is placed inside this cavity. The question is about finding the electric field E at a point P, which is outside the spherical conductor. The distance from the center of the conductor to point P is L, and from the center of the cavity to P is l. Both L and l are greater than R, so P is outside the conductor. The angle between l and s is theta.

The options are A, B, C, D, each giving a different formula for E.

Hmm, I remember that conductors have some interesting properties regarding electric fields and charges. So, let's think. When a conductor is neutral, and you place a charge inside a cavity, the conductor's charges will redistribute. But wait, the conductor here is uncharged, so the total charge on it is zero. But when you put a charge inside the cavity, the conductor must have induced charges.

Wait, the cavity is conducting? No, wait, the conductor is the spherical one. The cavity is just empty space, I think. So, when you place +q inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor (the cavity's inner wall) will have an induced charge of -q, because the conductor is a conductor, so charges can move. The outer surface would then have a charge of +q to keep the total charge of the conductor zero (since the conductor was initially uncharged). Hmm, is that correct? Or wait, no. Wait, the conductor is neutral. When you place +q in the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor (the cavity's walls) will have -q induced. But the conductor itself must remain neutral, so the outer surface must have +q. Because the total charge on the conductor is zero, so the inner surface is -q, the outer +q, adding up to zero.

But wait, the conductor's net charge is zero. So, yes, inner cavity's conductor part has -q, outer surface has +q.
