Okay, so I'm looking at this organic chemistry problem, and I need to figure out the correct starting materials for two reactions. The question involves the use of different reducing agents and the stereochemistry of the products. Hmm, let's break this down.

So the problem states that a chemist performed two reactions with two unknown compounds, A and B. Each was treated with a different reducing agent: LiBH4 and BH3. The products are both (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, respectively. Wait, no, looking again: A reacts with LiBH4 and H+ to give (R) product. B reacts with BH3 and H+ to give (S) product.

Wait, no, the products are the same except for their configurations. Both reactions produce 4-ethyl... something, but one is R and the other S. Interesting. So the same compound is formed but as enantiomers? Or maybe the same structure with different stereochemistry?

Wait, the product in both cases is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. So that's a cyclic ketone. The substituents are on the 4 position. The configurations are R and S, so the product has a stereogenic center at position 2 or 4. Let me think about the structure.

Pyran-2-one is a cyclic ketone. So it's a six-membered ring with a ketone group at position 2. The positions are 1,2,3,4,5,6. So the substituents would be on the ring. The 4-ethyl would be an ethyl group attached to carbon 4. But wait, tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one suggests that the ring is saturated, except for the double bond in position 2? Or is it fully saturated except for a double bond between 2 and 3? Wait, no, the notation is for the position of the ketone. So the ring is partially hydrogenated.

Wait, actually, pyran is a six-membered ring with one oxygen, similar to pyrone. Oh wait, pyran-2-one is a cyclic ketone, so the ring has an oxygen and a ketone at position 2. So the structure would be an oxygen at position 1, and a ketone at position 2. The ring is in a chair-like conformation, perhaps, but more importantly, the substituents' positions are key.

But perhaps I should think about how the product is formed. The reactions involve reducing agents—LiBH4 and BH3. Wait, LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, typically used for ketones to form secondary alcohols. But wait, in this case, the product is a ketone. That's confusing. Or maybe I'm thinking about the wrong reaction.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is an epoxide or a carbonyl group that's being reduced. Alternatively, maybe the starting material is an ester or something that, upon reduction, forms the cyclic ketone. Hmm.

Wait another approach: the product is a tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. That's a cyclic hemiacetal, perhaps? Or a cyclic ether with a ketone. Alternatively, maybe it's a six-membered ring with an oxygen and a ketone. Let me imagine the structure. So the ring has five carbons and one oxygen, arranged as O-C-C-C-C-C. The ketone is at position 2, so the oxygen is at position 1, and the ketone is at position 2. So the ring is something like O connected to C1, which is connected to C2 (with the ketone), then C3, C4 (with ethyl), C5, C6, and back to O.

But how is this formed from the starting materials? The starting materials are compounds A and B, which are treated with different reducing agents to form the same product but with different configurations (R and S).

Wait, the product is a cyclic ketone. So perhaps the starting material is a cyclic hemiacetal or an acetal. Alternatively, perhaps it's an ester that undergoes a reduction. Alternatively, maybe the starting material is a cyclic ester or something similar.

Wait, maybe the product is formed via a ring-opening or ring-forming reaction. Alternatively, could it be a Claisen or aldol condensation product? Or perhaps the starting materials are epoxides that are being reduced to form the cyclic ketone.

Wait, another angle: the products are (R) and (S) configurations, so the reduction must be stereoselective. The reducing agents might influence the configuration of the product.

LiBH4 is a stronger reducing agent than BH3. LiBH4 is typically used for reducing esters, amides, ketones, etc. BH3 is often used for ketone reductions as well, but maybe under different conditions. Wait, but BH3 is a Lewis acid and is often used for epoxide ring-opening reactions, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the starting materials are esters. Let me think about that. If the starting material is an ester, like R-O-CO-R', then reducing it with LiBH4 could form an alcohol. But the product is a cyclic ketone, so that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are cyclic ketals or acetals. Wait, when you reduce an acetal, you might get an alcohol, but I'm not sure how that leads to a ketone.

Hmm, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic hemiacetal. Wait, but reducing that would give something else. Alternatively, maybe the starting material is a cyclic ether, and the reduction is adding hydrogen in a specific way.

Wait, another thought: the product is a cyclic ketone, so perhaps the starting material is an alpha-hydroxy ketone. Wait, but how would a reducing agent form a cyclic ketone from that?

Alternatively, maybe the starting material is a diethyl acetal or something similar. Let me think about the possible structures of A and B.

Looking at the options, the starting materials are 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acids. So the structure would be a pentanoic acid with substituents at positions 3 and 5. Position 3 is ethyl, position 5 is isobutoxy and oxo (a ketone group).

The formula would be: the carboxylic acid is at one end. Let me imagine the structure: CH2-COOH (the carboxylic acid end), then at position 3 (two carbons away) is an ethyl group. At position 5 (four carbons from COOH?), wait, wait, wait. Let me count.

Wait, pentanoic acid is CH2CH2CH2CH2COOH? No, wait, pentanoic acid is CH3CH2CH2CH2COOH (but that's five carbons including the COOH). So the chain is five carbons: COOH, CH2, CH2, CH2, CH3.

Wait, no, wait. Pentanoic acid is CH2CH2CH2CH2COOH? No, no: actually, pentanoic acid is CH3CH2CH2CH2COOH. No, wait, no: wait, but wait, the structure is CH2CH2CH2CH2COOH? No, wait, wait, no. Wait, carboxylic acid is RCOOH. So pentanoic acid is CH2CH2CH2CH2COOH? Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think: for pentanoic acid, the formula is CH2CH2CH2CH2COOH? No, wait, no, it's CH3(CH2)3COOH. So the chain is CH3-CH2-CH2-CH2-COOH. So position 1 is the COOH, then positions 2,3,4,5 are the CH2 groups, but wait, the chain is four CH2 groups plus COOH.

Wait, no. Wait, the correct formula for pentanoic acid is CH2CH2CH2CH2COOH. Hmm, maybe I should draw it.

But perhaps instead, the starting materials are 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. So the structure would be:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-O-CH(CH2CH3)2 ?

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to write the structure.

The molecule is pentanoic acid (five carbon chain), so COOH is at position 1. Then positions 2,3,4,5.

But the substituents are at positions 3 and 5.

At position 3: an ethyl group (CH2CH3).

At position 5: isobutoxy (OCH(CH2CH3)2) and oxo (a ketone group).

Wait, but position 5 would be the last carbon before the COOH. So perhaps the structure is:

COOH - CH2 - C(ethyl)(O-isobutoxy) - CH2 - ?

Wait, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

O

|

O-C-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-COOH ?

No, maybe I'm getting it wrong.

Alternatively, the structure is:

O

|

O-CH(CH2CH2CH3)2

|

C=O

Connected to a CH2 group, then another CH2, then a CH(CH2CH3), and the COOH.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is:

The molecule is pentanoic acid where at position 3, there is an ethyl group, and at position 5, there is an isobutoxy group and a ketone. So the structure would be:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH(OCH(CH2CH3)2)-CO something?

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again.

The name is 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.

Pentanoic acid: 5 carbons, COOH at end.

The substituents are at position 3 (ethyl) and position 5 (isobutoxy and oxo). So position 5 is the same as the COOH position? No, because pentanoic acid has the COOH on the first carbon.

Wait, that can't be. Because 5-oxo would imply a ketone group on the fifth carbon, which is the same as the COOH, which is not possible because carbonyl and carboxylic acid can't be on the same carbon. So perhaps I'm miscounting the positions.

Wait, maybe the structure is written as:

Position 1: COOH

Position 2: CH2

Position 3: CH(CH2CH3)

Position 4: CH(OCH(CH2CH3)2 )

Position 5: CO?

Wait, no, that would make it a six-carbon chain.

Wait, perhaps the molecule is:

The main chain is five carbons. The substituents are at position 3 and 5.

So:

1: COOH

2: CH2

3: CH(CH2CH3)

4: CH(O... )

5: ?

Wait, perhaps the substituents are on the same carbon. So position 5 is the same as position 4? No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CO-O-CH(CH2CH3)2 ?

But that would be 3-ethyl-4-isobutoxy-pentanoic acid. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the substituents are on the same carbon.

Wait, in any case, perhaps the starting material is a ketone with an ester group or an acetal group that can be reduced.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic hemiacetal or acetal that, upon reduction, forms the cyclic ketone.

Wait, another approach: the product is (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. So the structure has a ring where the substituents are arranged in a certain way, leading to the R configuration.

When you reduce a ketone, you typically form an alcohol. But in this case, the product is a ketone, which suggests that the starting material might have a different functional group. For example, perhaps the starting material is an ester or a nitrile or an alkyne that, upon reduction, forms the ketone. Wait, no, LiBH4 and BH3 are typically for reducing carbonyls, not adding to them.

Wait, but in this case, the product is a ketone, so perhaps the starting material is an acetal or another type of compound that, upon reduction, gives a ring structure with a ketone.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic acetal. For example, imagine a cyclic acetal structure where, upon reduction, the acetal is opened and the ketone is formed.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think about the reduction reactions.

LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent. It can reduce esters to alcohols. But in the product, it's a ketone. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: the starting material could be a cyclic ester, like a lactone. When reduced, the ester group would be converted to a diol, but that's not leading to a ketone.

Alternatively, maybe the starting material is an epoxide. But when you reduce an epoxide with LiBH4 or BH3, you usually get an alcohol, not a ketone.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ketone with some protecting groups, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a diethyl acetate or some acetal that, upon reduction, forms the cyclic ketone.

Wait, another angle: the product is a cyclic ketone, which could have been formed via a ring-closing reaction. The starting material might be a diol or a ketone with a certain configuration that forms the ring upon reduction.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a β-keto ester, which upon reduction would form a secondary alcohol, but that doesn't fit with the product being a ketone.

Wait, maybe the starting material is a benzaldehyde-like compound, but I don't see how that would form a cyclic product.

Wait a minute, perhaps the product is formed via a ring-opening of an epoxide with the reducing agent. But how would that lead to a ketone? Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ether, and upon reduction, it becomes a diol, but then how does that form a ketone.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about the possible reactions.

LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, often used to reduce esters to alcohols. But in the product, it's a ketone, so maybe the starting material is an ester which, when reduced, forms a secondary alcohol. But the product is a ketone, so that doesn't make sense.

Wait, maybe the starting material is a cyclic hemiacetal. For example, consider that when you reduce a cyclic hemiacetal, you might open it and form a diol, which then could cyclize again under certain conditions to form a ketone. But that's getting too speculative.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a ketone that is part of a cyclic structure. Wait, but the product is a cyclic ketone, same as the starting material. That doesn't make sense.

Wait, another approach: the starting materials A and B are enantiomers. Because when you reduce a chiral starting material with different reagents, you might get different configurations in the product.

Wait, looking at the options, options C and D have A and B as different enantiomers. So for example, option C says A is S, B is R. Option D is the reverse.

Now, the product from A (using LiBH4) is R, and from B (using BH3) is S. So perhaps the configuration of the starting material determines the configuration of the product.

Wait, the reaction involves either LiBH4 or BH3. How do these reagents affect the stereochemistry of the product?

LiBH4 is typically used in the reduction of ketones to secondary alcohols. It's a bulky reagent, so maybe it's involved in some stereoselective reduction, like the Cram or Felkin-Anh model. Similarly, BH3 is a smaller reagent and might approach from a different face, leading to different configurations.

Wait, but in this case, the product is a ketone. Wait, that's confusing. Because if you're reducing a carbonyl group, you would get an alcohol, not a ketone.

Wait, unless the starting material is not a ketone but something else. For instance, maybe the starting material is an ester, which upon reduction gives an alcohol, and then undergoes some further reaction to form the ketone. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a β-diketone, which upon reduction gives a diol, but that still doesn't explain the product being a cyclic ketone.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something about the reaction conditions. The product is formed after adding H+ (acid workup). So maybe it's a case of ring formation via acid-catalyzed cyclization.

Ah, that might make sense. Let's say the starting material is a β-hydroxy ketone. When treated with acid, it could undergo cyclization to form a cyclic ketone.

But then, how is the β-hydroxy ketone formed? From the reduction of a ketone or an aldehyde.

Wait, here's a possible pathway:

The starting material is a β-keto ester. Let's say it's something like CH2-CO-O-R, where R is some group.

When you reduce this with LiBH4, the ester group (COOR) is reduced to CH2OH. So the product would be CH2-CO-CH2OH.

But then, under acidic conditions, this could form a cyclic hemiacetal or undergo some cyclization.

Alternatively, if the starting material is a β-ketoester, upon reduction, LiBH4 might reduce the ester group to an alcohol, giving a β-hydroxy ketone. Then, under acidic conditions, this could cyclize to form a cyclic ketone.

That makes sense. So the starting material is a β-ketoester, and upon reduction and acid workup, it forms a cyclic product.

But wait, in the options, the starting materials are 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. So that's a pentanoic acid with an ethyl group at position 3 and an isobutoxy group and ketone at position 5.

Wait, position 5 would be the same as the carboxylic acid, which is at position 1, so that doesn't make sense. Hmm, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

O

||

C(O)CH2CH2CH(CH2CH3)O-CH(CH2CH3)2 

No, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a β-ketoester, which upon reduction with LiBH4 would form a β-hydroxy ester, which then, under acid conditions, would lose water to form a cyclic ketone.

Wait, that's a plausible mechanism.

So, the starting material would be a β-keto ester. When reduced, it becomes a β-hydroxy ester. Then, under acidic conditions, it undergoes cyclization to form a cyclic ketone.

But then, the stereochemistry of the hydroxyl group would determine the configuration of the resulting cyclic ketone.

So, the reduction with LiBH4 and BH3 would produce different stereochemistry in the β-hydroxy ester, which would then lead to different configurations in the cyclic product.

Now, considering the reagents: LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, typically used in the reduction of esters. BH3 is another reducing agent, perhaps in a less strong or different condition.

Wait, but BH3 is usually used for ketone reductions as well. So how does the choice of reducing agent affect the stereochemistry here?

In the reduction of a carbonyl group, the approach of the hydride (from LiBH4 or BH3) would determine the face where the hydrogen adds, leading to the stereochemistry of the resulting alcohol.

If the starting material is a β-ketoester, the reduction would target the ester group. Wait, no, β-ketoester has two carbonyl groups: the keto and the ester.

Wait, perhaps the reducing agent is selective for a particular carbonyl group. For example, LiBH4 might reduce the ester group (the more reactive one) while BH3 might reduce the ketone group.

But that's unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a β-keto ester, and the reducing agent is reducing the ester group.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is not a direct reduction but involves some rearrangement. Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is an acetal, and the reducing agent opens the acetal to form a diol, which then cyclizes under acidic conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic acetal, and the reduction with LiBH4 or BH3 leads to ring-opening and formation of a diol, which then under acidic conditions forms the cyclic ketone.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me approach this from another angle.

The product is a cyclic ketone, which suggests that the starting material must have a structure that can form a ring upon reduction and acid workup.

Perhaps the starting material is a β-diketone ester, which upon reduction would form a diol, which then cyclizes to form the ring.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is an acyloin (a β-diketone), which upon reduction forms a diol, which can cyclize into a ring.

For example, if the starting material is 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, then upon reduction, the 5-oxo group (a ketone) would be reduced to a CH2OH group. Then, perhaps this forms a diol, which can undergo cyclization to form the cyclic ketone.

Wait, but the product is a cyclic ketone, so the oxidation state would need to increase. That doesn't make sense because reduction would lower the oxidation state.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this all wrong. Maybe the starting material isn't a ketone but an ester or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a β-keto ester, and upon reduction, the ester is converted into an alcohol, leading to a β-hydroxy ketone. Then, under acidic conditions, this could undergo elimination to form a double bond, and then cyclize to form the ring.

But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a β-keto ester, and when reduced, the ester is converted to a CH2OH group. Then, under acidic conditions, the β-hydroxy ketone could eliminate water to form a double bond, which could then undergo cyclization to form the cyclic ketone.

But I'm not certain about the exact steps.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is an aldehyde. Wait, but then the product is a cyclic ketone. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a β-hydroxy ester. When treated with LiBH4, which is a strong reducing agent, it might not react, but if the starting material is an aldehyde, perhaps it would reduce to a primary alcohol.

This is getting too confusing. Let's try to think about the options.

The options are all about whether A and B are (R) or (S) configurations. The products are R and S, depending on which reagent is used.

So, the starting material must be a chiral molecule. Because when it's reduced, the product's configuration depends on the starting material's configuration and the reagent's approach.

Wait, the starting materials are 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. So, looking at the structure, the oxo group is at position 5, which is adjacent to the COOH group. That may not be possible because having a carbonyl and a carboxylic acid on adjacent carbons would lead to some instability, but perhaps it's possible.

Wait, but in any case, the starting material is chiral because of the substituents.

So the structure would have a stereogenic center. Let's imagine the structure:

Carboxylic acid (COOH) at position 1.

At position 3, an ethyl group.

At position 5, an isobutoxy group (OCH(CH2CH3)2) and a ketone (oxo group).

Wait, but position 5 is the same as position 4, perhaps. Maybe the structure is:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-C(OCH(CH2CH3)2)=O ?

No, that doesn't make sense as a ketone and an ether on the same carbon.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH(OCH(CH2CH3)2)-CO ?

No, that can't be right because the last carbon (position 5) would have the COOH, which can't have a CO group as well.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating the structure. Let me just think about the reaction.

The product is a cyclic ketone, and the starting material is a β-keto ester. So, when the ester is reduced, it becomes a β-hydroxy ketone. Then, under acidic conditions, this might eliminate to form a double bond and cyclize.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is an acetal. When treated with a reducing agent, the acetal is opened to form a diol, which then cyclizes to form the cyclic ketone.

Wait, but how would that happen.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic hemiacetal. When reduced, it forms a diol, which then loses water to form a ring, leading to the cyclic ketone.

But I'm not entirely sure.

Another angle: the product (4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one) has substituents on carbon 4. So during the reaction, the ethyl group comes from somewhere in the starting material.

Looking at the options, the starting materials have an ethyl group at position 3 and an isobutoxy group at position 5. So during the reaction, perhaps the ethyl group is retained in the product, and the isobutoxy group is lost or transformed.

Wait, but the product's substituents are ethyl and the ring structure. So perhaps the isobutoxy group is being removed or transformed into a ring.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is an ester with an isobutoxy group. When reduced, the ester becomes an alcohol, which then forms the ring.

Wait, assuming that the starting material is 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. Let's imagine it's a six-membered ring in the product, so perhaps the chain is five carbons, with substituents at positions 3 and 5.

Wait, perhaps the 5-isobutoxy-oxo group is forming the ring when the ester group is reduced.

Wait, maybe after reduction, the oxygen in the isobutoxy group becomes part of the ring.

But I'm not sure.

Given that I'm stuck on the exact mechanism, perhaps I should focus on the stereochemistry part and the options.

The products are (R) and (S), depending on which reagent is used. So which reagent leads to which configuration.

LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent. It's known for inducing certain stereochemical outcomes. BH3 is a weaker reducing agent and might approach from a different face.

Wait, in the reduction of a ketone, the hydride adds to the carbonyl carbon. The stereochemistry of the product (the alcohol) depends on which face the hydride approaches from.

If the starting material is a planar sp2 hybridized carbonyl, the hydride can attack from either face, leading to racemic mixture. But if the starting material is chiral, then the attack could be influenced by the existing configuration, leading to diastereoselectivity.

Wait, but in this problem, the starting materials are the same (same molecule) but treated with different reagents, leading to different configurations.

Wait, no, the starting materials A and B are different. From the options, A and B are either same or different enantiomers.

In the products, the configurations are R and S, which are mirror images.

So perhaps the starting materials are enantiomers, and the reagents cause the hydride to add from different faces, leading to opposite configurations in the product.

Wait, but how would that happen? If the starting material is a chiral β-keto ester, the reduction would form an alcohol with a certain configuration, which would then cyclize to form the ring with a certain configuration.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material's configuration determines the approach of the reducing agent, leading to different configurations in the product.

Wait, perhaps when starting with (S) configuration, using LiBH4 would lead to R in the product, and using BH3 would lead to S, or vice versa.

But I'm not sure about the exact relationship.

Wait, perhaps the mechanism is like this: the starting material is a β-keto ester, which upon reduction with LiBH4 forms a β-hydroxy ester, which then cyclizes under acidic conditions to form the cyclic ketone. The configuration of the starting material and the reducing agent's approach determine the configuration of the product.

If the starting material is (S), and the reducing agent adds the hydride from a certain face, leading to a specific configuration in the hydroxy group, which then leads to the R configuration in the ring.

Similarly, if the starting material is (R), then the same or opposite configuration would result in the product.

Alternatively, perhaps the configuration of the starting material and the reducing agent's selectivity (LiBH4 or BH3) determine the product's configuration.

Given that the products are R and S, the starting materials must be enantiomers. So looking at the options, only options C and D have A and B as different enantiomers.

So, the correct answer must be either C or D.

Now, the question is which reagent (LiBH4 or BH3) leads to which configuration.

LiBH4 is a strong, bulky reducing agent. It tends to approach from the less hindered face, leading to anti addition in certain cases. BH3 is less bulky, so it might approach from a different face.

Wait, in the reduction of ketones, the less hindered face would be approached by the hydride. So if the starting material has a certain configuration, the hydride would add from the face that's less hindered.

But since the starting material is a β-keto ester, when reduced, the ester group (more reactive than the ketone, perhaps) would be reduced first.

Wait, perhaps the ester is more reactive towards reduction than the ketone. So LiBH4 would reduce the ester group, leading to a β-hydroxy ketone.

The configuration of the starting material would influence which face the hydride approaches from, thus determining the configuration of the hydroxyl group.

Then, when the β-hydroxy ketone cyclizes under acidic conditions, the configuration of the hydroxyl group determines the configuration of the ring.

So, for example, if the hydroxyl group is on a certain side, the ring forms with either R or S configuration.

In that case, the configuration of the starting material and the approach of the reducing agent (determined by its size and structure) would lead to the product's configuration.

Assuming that LiBH4, being bulkier, approaches from the less hindered face, leading to a certain configuration, while BH3 approaches from the other face, leading to the opposite configuration.

So, if starting material A is (S) and is treated with LiBH4, it forms (R) product. Starting material B is (R) and is treated with BH3, leading to (S) product. Or some other combination.

Looking at the options, option D says A is (R), B is (S). So when A is (R) and treated with LiBH4, product is (R). When B is (S) and treated with BH3, product is (S).

Wait, but how does the starting material's configuration and the reagent's selectivity lead to product configuration?

Alternatively, perhaps the reagent's steric effects cause the hydride to approach differently, leading to different configurations.

If the starting material is (R), and the reducing agent adds hydride from the same face, the product would be (R) or (S) depending on the starting material's configuration.

Alternatively, perhaps using LiBH4 leads to the opposite configuration because of the approach direction, while BH3 leads to the same configuration.

But I'm not entirely sure.

Given the time I've spent and the need to proceed, I'll make an educated guess based on the options.

The correct starting materials would be such that A and B are enantiomers, leading to the R and S products when treated with different reducing agents.

So the options are either C or D.

Assuming that the reagent's approach leads to opposite configurations. So if A is (R), treated with LiBH4 gives (R), and B is (S), treated with BH3 gives (S).

Looking at option D: A is (R), B is (S).

So, if A is (R) and treated with LiBH4, product is R. B is (S), treated with BH3, product is S.

But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, the opposite could be true.

Alternatively, perhaps the configuration of the starting material and the reagent together determine the product's configuration.

Wait, another thought: if the starting material is (R), the hydride adds from the opposite face, leading to (S) product. But if the reagent is LiBH4, which is more selective, perhaps it leads to the opposite configuration.

But I'm not certain.

In any case, based on the options and the reasoning that A and B must be enantiomers, the correct answer is either C or D.

If the product from A is R when using LiBH4, and product from B is S when using BH3, then A must have a configuration that when reduced with LiBH4 gives R, and B must have a configuration that when reduced with BH3 gives S.

So if A is (S), then LiBH4's approach would lead to R. If B is (R), then BH3's approach would lead to S.

Looking at option C: A is (S), B is (R).

So when A is (S) and treated with LiBH4, product is R. When B is (R) and treated with BH3, product is S.

That fits with the given reactions.

Therefore, option C would be correct.


The problem involves determining the correct starting materials (A and B) for two reactions that produce enantiomeric products, (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, using different reducing agents: LiBH4 and BH3. The starting materials are 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acids with different stereochemical configurations.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Product Structure**: The product is a cyclic ketone, 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, with stereochemistry at the 2-position. The two enantiomers, (R) and (S), result from the stereochemical outcome of the reduction and subsequent cyclization.

2. **Reagents and Stereochemistry**:
   - **LiBH4**: A strong, bulky reducing agent that typically approaches the carbonyl group from the less hindered face, influencing the stereochemistry of the product.
   - **BH3**: A less bulky reducing agent that may approach from a different face compared to LiBH4, leading to the opposite stereochemical outcome.

3. **Starting Materials**:
   - The starting materials are chiral β-keto esters: 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acids. The stereochemistry of the starting material (R or S) determines the face of the carbonyl group that the reducing agent attacks.
   - The reduction of the ester group forms a β-hydroxy ketone, which then undergoes cyclization under acidic conditions to form the cyclic ketone product.

4. **Options**:
   - **Option A and B**: Both have identical starting materials (A and B are the same enantiomer), which cannot produce enantiomeric products. These options are incorrect.
   - **Option C**: A is (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, and B is (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. This combination allows for the formation of (R) and (S) products depending on the reducing agent used.
   - **Option D**: A is (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, and B is (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. This combination also allows for the formation of (R) and (S) products depending on the reducing agent used.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The stereochemistry of the starting material and the reducing agent determine the configuration of the product. LiBH4 and BH3 approach the carbonyl group from opposite faces, leading to the formation of enantiomeric products.
   - Option C is correct because:
     - When (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid (A) is treated with LiBH4, the product is (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.
     - When (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid (B) is treated with BH3, the product is (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.
