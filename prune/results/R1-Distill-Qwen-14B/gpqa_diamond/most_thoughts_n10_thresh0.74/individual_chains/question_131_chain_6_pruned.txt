Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still learning the ropes. Let's try to break it down step by step. 

The question starts with a dicarboxylic acid that has a cis-alkene. When this acid is dehydrated, it forms an anhydride. I remember that dehydration of dicarboxylic acids usually leads to anhydrides, and if the acid has a double bond, the dehydration might form an anhydride with some conjugation or specific structure.

The anhydride has some specific NMR data. The 1H NMR shows a single peak at 7 ppm. Hmm, 7 ppm is usually where aromatic protons show up, but wait, maybe it's not aromatic. Alternatively, maybe it's a proton that's deshielded, like an aldehyde or something else. Or perhaps it's an alpha proton to an electron-withdrawing group, like a carbonyl. But wait, the anhydride structure... Anhydrides have carbonyl groups, so maybe the peak is from an olefinic proton? But wait, the original acid has a cis-alkene, which upon dehydration would form an anhydride. But wait, when you dehydrate a diacid, you lose two water molecules, right? Or maybe one? I think for a diacid, like HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH, dehydration would form the anhydride O=C-O-C-CH2-CH2-O-C=O, but perhaps in this case, since the starting material has a cis-alkene, the resulting anhydride would have a double bond somewhere else? Or maybe the dehydration leads to a cyclic anhydride, like a five-membered ring.

Wait, maybe the anhydride is a cyclic one. Let me think. The starting material is a dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene. So perhaps it's something like HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH but with a double bond. Wait, no, the starting compound is a dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene. So maybe the structure is HOOC-CH2-CH2-CH2-COOH but with a double bond in the middle, like HOOC-CH2-CH2-CH2-COO
