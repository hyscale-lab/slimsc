Okay, so I have this question about electron microscopes and mean free paths. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

So, Mike is working on a high-resolution transmission electron microscope. He's using a really high accelerating voltage, 1000 kV. That's a lot! Anyway, the setup requires a vacuum because the electrons are so high energy. He's using vacuum pumps to get an ultra-high vacuum, less than 10^-9 Torr. That's super low pressure, so few gas molecules should be present.

He measures the mean free path, which is the average distance a gas molecule travels between collisions. He calculates λ1 based on factors like the volume, pressure, and temperature of the sample compartment. Mean free path usually depends on pressure and temperature, I remember. Lower pressure (rarer gas) means longer mean free path because molecules don't collide as often.

But then, when he turns on the electron beam, he notices that the mean free path changes. It's no longer λ1 but λ2. And the temperature is the same, so that shouldn't affect it. So what's causing the change?

Wait, the mean free path in a gas is given by the formula λ = (k*T)/(sqrt(2) * π * d² * P), where k is Boltzmann's constant, T is temperature, d is the diameter of the molecules, and P is pressure. Since T and d are the same, if P changes, λ changes. But the pressure in the compartment was already under ultra-high vacuum. So why would it change when the electron beam is on?

Oh, right! When the electron beam is active, it's producing a lot of electrons. Those high-energy electrons can interact with the gas molecules. Maybe the electrons are causing the gas molecules to ionize. So, the gas becomes partially ionized, meaning some molecules are now ions. 

Ions have a different effect on the mean free path. For one, charged particles interact more strongly with each other. Also, if the gas is ionized, the number of collisions might change. But wait, in a vacuum, the mean free path is about how often gas molecules collide with each other. If the gas density is really low, collisions are rare. But when the electron beam comes on, maybe the electrons are causing more ionization. 

Wait, another angle: when the electron beam is on, it's a source of electrons. These electrons can collide with the gas molecules. Each time an electron scatters off a gas molecule, it changes the path of the electron beam. But how does this affect the gas's mean free path?

Alternatively, maybe the presence of the electron beam causes the gas to heat up locally, but no, the question states the temperature remains the same. So temperature isn't the issue.

Or, perhaps the electron beam is causing gas molecules to be knocked out of the compartment, like via sputtering or some other process. But that would reduce the pressure, which would increase the mean free path. But in the scenario, Mike says the mean free path is now λ2, which is different from λ1. Wait, but the question doesn't specify whether λ2 is longer or shorter than λ1. The options don't specify without looking, so let's see.

Wait, the question says that when the
