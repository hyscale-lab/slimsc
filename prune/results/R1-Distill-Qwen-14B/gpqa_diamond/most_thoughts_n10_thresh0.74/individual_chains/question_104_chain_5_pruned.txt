Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, let me think. Radial velocity method relies on the Doppler shift, right? When a star is moving towards us, the spectral lines shift blue, and when moving away, red. The shift tells us about the planet's presence because the planet's gravity makes the star wobble.

The question says there are two stars with the same mass as the Sun. Each has a planet similar to Neptune's mass. Both have circular orbits. The RV method detected the planets, and the spectral line shifts are given. Planet #1 has a shift of 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2 is 7 milliangstroms. We need to find how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1.

Wait, RV method measures the star's velocity towards and away from us. The semi-amplitude of this velocity, K, is what's given here. So the shift corresponds to K, the velocity semi-amplitude.

The formula for K is K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) ) ) )^(1/3) * (1/( (1 + M_p/M_star)^(2/3) )) ) * (1 / ( (1 AU)^0.5 )) )? Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the formula I remember: K = ( (27 * pi * G) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) ) )

Wait, another approach. The RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ (G * M_p) / (M_star^(2/3)) ]^(1/3) * (1 / ( (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3) )) ) * (1 / ( (1 + (M_p/(M_star)) )^(2/3) )) )? Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe there's a simpler relation here.

Alternatively, for a given planet mass and star mass, the semi-amplitude K depends on the orbital period and the velocity.

Wait, the formula I remember is K = (v) = (2Ï€ G)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star
