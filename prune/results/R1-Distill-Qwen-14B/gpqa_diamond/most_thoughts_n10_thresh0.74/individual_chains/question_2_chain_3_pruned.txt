Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question says that trans-cinnamaldehyde was treated with methylmagnesium bromide to form product 1. Then, product 1 was treated with pyridinium chlorochromate to form product 2. Then, product 2 was treated with (dimethyl(oxo)-l6-sulfaneylidene)methane in DMSO at elevated temperature to form product 3. The question is asking how many carbon atoms are in product 3. The options are A)14, B)10, C)12, D)11.

Hmm, let's break this down. I'm a bit rusty on some of these reactions, but I'll try to remember what I learned.

First, the starting material is trans-cinnamaldehyde. I remember that cinnamaldehyde has a benzene ring connected to a propenal group. Trans-cinnamaldehyde has the double bond in the trans configuration. So its structure is something like benzaldehyde with a double bond adjacent to the benzene ring. The structure is Ph-CH2-CH2-CHO? Wait, no. Wait, no. Cinnamaldehyde is Ph-CH2-CH2-CHO? No, wait, more accurately, it's Ph-CH=CH-CHO. Wait, no, I think I'm mixing up cinnamaldehyde and something else. Let me think. Cinnamaldehyde is an aromatic aldehyde. The structure is benzene ring connected to a CH2 group, which is connected via a double bond to another CH group, which has an aldehyde. So the structure is Ph-CH2-CH=CH-CHO? No, wait, that can't be right. I think it's actually Ph-CH2-CH2-CHO? No, no, wait, no. Wait, cinnamaldehyde is (E)-3-phenylprop-2-enal. So the structure is Ph-CH2-CHO with a double bond between the middle two carbons. Oh wait, no. Let me draw it out mentally. The aldehyde is at the end, and the double bond is between the two carbons before that. So, it's Ph-CH2-CH2-CHO? No, wait, perhaps it's Ph-CH2-CHO. No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, I think the correct structure of
