Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. The question is about calculating the enthalpy of formation of a specific organic compound. The compound given is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. I'm a bit rusty on my enthalpy concepts, but let's see if I can work through this.

First, I remember that the enthalpy of formation (ΔHf°) is the change in enthalpy when one mole of a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. So, I probably need to calculate the bond energies involved in breaking the bonds of the reactants and forming the bonds in the product.

Wait, but the problem gives me enthalpy of atomization for carbon, which is 1000 kJ/mol. Oh right, atomization is when elements are broken into their constituent atoms. So for carbon, that means breaking C-C bonds if it's in a solid form. Hmm, perhaps this is part of the data I need to use.

The given bond energies are:
- H-H: 100 kJ/mol
- C-C: 200 kJ/mol
- C=C: 300 kJ/mol
- C-H: 400 kJ/mol

So, I think the approach here is to consider the formation of the compound from its elements (C and H) and calculate the enthalpy change using bond energies.

Wait, but wait. The formula for enthalpy of formation using bond energies is: ΔHf = sum of bond energies of reactants - sum of bond energies of products. Or is it the other way around? No, no, wait. Normally, when forming a molecule, you have to break bonds in reactants and form bonds in products. So the enthalpy change is (sum of bonds broken) minus (sum of bonds formed). But wait, for the formation reaction, the reactants are the elements in their standard states. So for carbon, that's graphite or some standard allotrope, and hydrogen gas (H2).

Alternatively, another approach is that the enthalpy of formation can be calculated using the atomization method. So, the enthalpy of formation is the sum of the atomization energies of the elements minus the sum of the bond energies in the compound.

Wait, actually, the formula I remember is: 
ΔHf = (Σ atomization energies of elements
