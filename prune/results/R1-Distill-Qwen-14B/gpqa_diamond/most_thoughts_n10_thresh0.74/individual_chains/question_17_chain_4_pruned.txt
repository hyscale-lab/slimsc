Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, let me think through this. I remember that EDTA forms complexes with metal ions, right? So the question is about the concentration of calcium ions in a solution that has a stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The concentration given is 0.02 M, and the formation constant, K, is 5x10^10. Oh wait, and the pH is ideal, so I don't need to worry about that complicating things.

Wait, what's the formula here? I think the formation constant K is for the reaction where Ca²+ and EDTA (Y^4-) combine to form the complex. The reaction is Ca²+ + Y^4- ↔ CaY²−. So the formation constant K is [CaY²-]/([Ca²+][Y^4-]). 

But wait, the solution is 0.02 M in the Ca-EDTA complex. That means the concentration of CaY²− is 0.02 M. So [CaY²−] = 0.02 M. 

I need to find [Ca²+]. Let's denote [Ca²+] as x. Then, since K is very large (5e10), the dissociation of the complex is going to be minimal. So the concentration of Y^4− will be approximately equal to x as well, because each CaY²− dissociates into one Ca²+ and one Y^4−. 

So substituting into the K equation: K = [CaY²−]/( [Ca²+][Y^4−] ) = 5e10. So 5e10 = (0.02) / (x * x) because [Ca²+] is x and [Y^4−] is x. So 5e10 = 0.02/(x²). 

Solving for x²: x² = 0.02 / (5e10). Let me calculate that. 0.02 is 2e-2. So 2e-2 divided by 5e10 is (2/5) * 1e-12. 2/5 is 0.4, so 0.4e-12, which is 4e-13. Then x² = 4e-13, so x is the square root of that. Square root of 4 is 2, and square root of 1e-13 is 1e-6.5, which is 3.16e-7. Wait, 1e-13's square root is 1e-6.5, which is about 3.16e-7. So x is 2*(3.16e-7) = 6.32e-7 M. 

Looking at the options, option C is 6.3x10^-7 M. That should be the right answer. 

Wait, but let me double-check the math. x² = 0.02/(5e10) = 2e-2/(5e10) = (2/5)*1e-12 = 0.4e-12
