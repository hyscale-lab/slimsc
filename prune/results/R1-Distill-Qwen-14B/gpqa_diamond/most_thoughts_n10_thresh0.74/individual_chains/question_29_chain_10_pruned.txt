Okay, so I've got this biology question here about gene mutations and their effects. Let's try to think through it step by step.

So the question is about a barley cultivar that's drought-resistant, but it has this anti-nutritional compound. The gene responsible for making that compound has five exons and four introns. They used EMS mutagenesis to create mutants, and looked at the target gene in each. The problem is to find which mutation would eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.

Hmm. I remember that EMS (Ethyl Methanesulfonate) is a mutagen that primarily causes point mutations, usually substitutions. So each of these mutants likely has a point mutation. The question is which mutation disrupts the gene's function, thereby stopping the production of the compound.

Looking at the given sequences, the intact gene is:

5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Each mutant shows changes in the first exon area. So, looking at each mutant:

Mutant 1: The sequence starts ATGTTCTACGCT... So the first part is ATGTTTCTC in the wild type, and in mutant 1, the next part is TACGCT. Let me compare:

Wild: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA...
Mutant1: ATG T TCT ACG C GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA...

Wait, perhaps I should compare each part.

Wait, let me look at each position. The wild type starts with ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA

Mutant 1:

5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

So the first few bases are ATG TTT CTC GCT, but in Mutant1, it's ATG TTCTACGCT. Wait, let's count the letters.

Wild type: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG...
Mutant1: ATG TTCTACGCT GGT ACT TCT GTG...

Wait no, perhaps aligning the sequences would help. Let me write out the wild type and each mutant's sequence for the first part.

Wild type first part: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT...

Mutant1: ATG TTCTACGCT GGT ACT...

So in the wild type, positions 1-18: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT

Mutant1's start: ATG TTCTACGCT GGT ACT

So the wild type after ATG is TTT CTC GCT. Mutant1 has TTCTACGCT.

Wait, perhaps looking for where the changes are:

Compare the wild type and each mutant.

Let's break it into segments.

Wild type (positions 1-30):

1-6: ATGTTT

7-12: CTCGCT

13-18: GGTACT

19-24: TCTGTG

25-30: GATGAA...

Mutant1:

1-6: ATGTTT (same as wild type)

7-12: CTCGCT → Wait, no. Wait, wait, perhaps the mutations are in the first exon, which is the first part of the mRNA, so any change in exons can affect the protein.

But the question is which mutation would eliminate the compound. So, likely a null mutation, which disrupts the gene function. Null mutations can be caused by premature stop codons.

Looking for a frameshift or a substitution that creates a stop codon early in the protein.

Wait, but EMS is a point mutagen, so frameshifts are less likely. So it's more about substitution.

Looking for a mutation that creates a stop codon. Stop codons are TAA, TAG, or TGA.

Looking at each mutant.

Wild type starts with ATG (which is the start codon, methionine). So the rest of the reading frame is important.

Let me look at the first few codons.

Wild type:

ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA ...

Each codon:

ATG (M), TTT (F), CTC (L), GCT (A), GGT (G), ACT (T), TCT (S), GTG (V), GAT (D), GAA (E), etc.

Mutant1:

ATG TTCTACGCT GGT ACT... Hmm, wait, let me write the sequence.

Mutant1's sequence starts as: ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

So the first part is ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACT.

Breaking into codons:

ATG (M), TTT (F), CTA (L), CGC (R), GGT (G), ACT (T), etc.

Wait, that's different. So the third codon in wild type is CTC (L), but in mutant1, it becomes CTA (L) and then CGC (R). So the 7-9 bases in wild type are CTC, which becomes CTA in mutant1's 7-9? Wait, perhaps I should look for where the change occurs.

Let me see the exact differences.

Wild type: ...CTCGCTGGTACT...

Mutant1: ...CTACGCTGGTACT...

Wait, perhaps I should line them up.

Wild type: positions 7-12: CTC GCT.

Mutant1: positions 7-12: CTA CGC.

Wait, perhaps the exact change is that instead of CTC GCT, it's CTA CGC.

So for the wild type, codons 3 and 4 are CTC (L) and GCT (A). In mutant1, codons 3 and 4 are CTA (L) and CGC (R). So the substitution changes the second codon from GCT to CGC (A to R). So mutant1 has a substitution in codon 4. No stop codon here, so the protein might have a different amino acid but not stop.

Mutant2:

5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

So let's compare.

Wild type: ...CTCGCTGGTACT...

Mutant2: ...CTAAGCTGGTACT...

So perhaps the change is in the CTC GCT region. Let me see.

In wild type, positions 7-12: C T C G C T.

In mutant2, it's C T A A G C T.

Wait, perhaps the wild type has CTC GCT and mutant2 has CTA AGC.

So codon 3 is CTC → CTA (still L), and codon4 becomes AGC (S). So no stop codon.

Mutant3:

5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Looking at the beginning:

Wild type: ...CTCGCTGGTACT...

Mutant3: ...TACGCTGGTGTCA...

So the wild type has CTC GCT GGT ACT.

Mutant3 seems to have TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT.

Wait, let's break it down.

Wild type positions 7-12: C T C G C T.

Mutant3 has T A C G C T.

So codon 3: CTC → TAC. So CTC is L, TAC is Y. So codon 3 changes from L to Y. Then codon4 remains GCT (A). But then, looking further, perhaps in mutant3, the next codon is GTCACT?

Wait, the wild type after codon4 is GCT (position 13-15: GGT). Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me look at the sequences again.

Wild type: ...CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT...

Mutant3: ...TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT...

Wait, so at the position after TACGCT, the wild type
