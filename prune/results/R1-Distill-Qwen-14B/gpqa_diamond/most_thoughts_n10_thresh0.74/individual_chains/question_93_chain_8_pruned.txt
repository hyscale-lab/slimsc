Okay, so I've got this question about qPCR and calibration curves. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The scientist made a calibration curve using a positive control with known copy numbers. He ran serially diluted samples in technical replicates. The efficiency was 100%, which I remember means the reaction is perfect—each cycle doubles the DNA. R squared is 1, so the correlation between concentration and Ct is perfect. The slope is -3.3. Wait, the slope in a qPCR curve usually relates to efficiency. Oh right, the formula for the slope is ln(10)/slope, but wait, no, more accurately, the efficiency is calculated using (10^(-1/slope)) minus 1, or something like that. Let me get that right. For a perfectly efficient reaction (100% efficiency), each cycle doubles the DNA. So the expected slope is -3.3219 because log2(10) is about 3.32. Oh, wait, the slope here is -3.3, which is very close. So that makes sense because the efficiency is 100%, so slope should be around that number.

Now, looking at the Ct values. Each dilution is ten-fold. So from 100000 to 10000 is a ten-fold dilution. The Ct values are decreasing as the concentration decreases. Wait, no—higher concentration should give lower Ct because more copies mean it reaches the threshold sooner. So 100000 copies give Ct around 34, and 10 copies give Ct around 20.7. So each ten-fold dilution increases the Ct by roughly 3.3 cycles. Because each ten-fold dilution would require 3.32 cycles more because log2(10)=3.32. So each step, the Ct increases by 3.3, which matches the slope.

Wait, but looking at the data: for 100000 copies, Ct is about 34. The next, 10000, is 30.6. So that's a difference of about 3.4. Then from 10000 to 1000, 30.6 to 27.3—again a 3.3 difference. Similarly, 1000 to 100 is about 3.3, and 100 to 10 is 3.3. Wait, but the exact values: 34.5 to 24.6 is 9.9 difference, but wait no, each step is a ten-fold, right? So each dilution by ten should add about 3.3 cycles. Let me count the differences between each Ct:

Between 100000 and 10000: 34.2 -30.9=3.3. Similarly, all the steps are about 3.3. So that makes sense. So all the Ct values are in the right place.

But the question is about discrepancies in the results. The scientist's results have triplicates that vary by about 0.3 each. Like, for 100000, the values are 33.9, 34.2, 34.5—each is about 0.3 apart. Similarly, each set of triplicates varies by 0.3. So that's within acceptable limits, right? Usually, technical replicates should have low variability. If the Ct's are within 0.3 or so, that's considered good.

Wait, the options: the question asks which option explains the discrepancies. So which of the options is correct.

Option D says the deviation is more than 0.3 between technical replicates. Wait, but in the data, the triplicates have a maximum deviation of 0.3 (like 34.5-33.9=0.6, but that's the range). Wait no, the maximum difference between any two in a set is 0.6. For example, 33.9, 34.2, 34.5: difference between first and third is 0.6. But generally, we look at the standard deviation or the maximum deviation within the replicates. If the maximum is 0.6, that's a bit high. Wait, what's the acceptable range for Ct variability in technical replicates? I think usually, a variation of less than 0.5 cycles is acceptable. Some sources say that technical replicates should have a Ct difference of less than 0.5. So 0.6 might be a bit high, but maybe it's still acceptable, or perhaps the question is pointing to this as an issue.

Option C: Ten-fold dilution is more than 3.3 cycles. Wait, no, because in each ten-fold, the Ct
