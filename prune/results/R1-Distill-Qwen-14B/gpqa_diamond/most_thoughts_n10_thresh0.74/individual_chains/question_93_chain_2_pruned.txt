Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this qPCR question. Hmm, let's see. The scientist is making a calibration curve, which I remember is like a standard curve to quantify the target nucleic acids. He used a positive control with known copy numbers and diluted it in a series of concentrations, running three technical replicates each time.

The efficiency is 100%, which is perfect, meaning each cycle halves the target. RÂ² is 1, so that's a perfect fit, indicating a strong linear relationship. The slope is -3.3. Wait, what does the slope mean? Oh right, in qPCR, the slope relates to the efficiency. The formula I think is slope = ln(10)/log10(efficiency). Wait, no, more accurately, the formula is slope = (ln(10) * log10(E)) ) / ln(E), but wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Alternatively, I remember that for 100% efficiency, the slope should be around -3.322. Oh wait, because E = 100% is 1, so ln(E) is 0, but that can't be right. Or wait, no, wait, the formula for the slope when using log10 of the quantity. Let me think again.

The standard curve typically uses the Ct values against the logarithm of the starting quantity. The formula for the slope in a standard curve is (ln(10) * log10(E)) ) / ln(E). Wait, no, wait, I'm mixing up the formulas. Alternatively, another approach: the efficiency E is the fraction of target amplified each cycle. So the relationship between Ct and the log of the starting quantity is linear. The slope of that line is (1/log10(E)) * ln(10), which is approximately -3.322 when E=1, since log10(1)=0, wait that doesn't make sense. Wait, actually, if the efficiency is 100% (E=1), then each cycle doubles the product. So the number of cycles needed is inversely proportional to the starting quantity. So the standard curve would be Ct = (log10 (1/E) ) * log10(N0) ) + intercept. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. The point is, the slope in a standard curve when efficiency is 100% is expected to be about -3.322.

In this case, the slope is -3.3, which is very close to the theoretical value of -3.322. So that's good, meaning the efficiency calculations are correct.

Looking at the data, the Ct values for each concentration are in triplicates. For example, 100000 copies: 33.9, 34.2, 34.5. So the average is around 34.2, with a small variation. Similarly for each concentration.

Now, the question is about the discrepancies in his results. The options suggest different issues.

Option A: qPCR can't quantify nucleic acids. That's not true. qPCR is used for quantification, so this is incorrect.

Option B: Ct values don't reflect the target amount
