Okay, so I have this physics problem about electric fields and conductors. Hmm, let me try to visualize it. The setup is a spherical conductor with a cavity inside. The conductor itself is uncharged, so it has no net charge. But there's a small cavity, radius r, and the center of the cavity is a distance s away from the center of the conductor. Oh wait, and the conductor's radius is R, which is bigger than r, so the cavity is entirely inside.

Now, they placed a small positive charge +q inside the cavity. I remember that when you have a charge inside a cavity of a conductor, the conductor's inner surface will induce an opposite charge. But wait, the conductor itself is neutral, right? So the inner surface of the conductor must have an induced charge -q, because the positive charge inside the cavity attracts negative charges to the inner surface. But wait, then what about the outer surface? Since the conductor is neutral overall, the outer surface must have a charge of +q because the inner surface is -q.

Wait, no, wait. The conductor is neutral, so any induced charges on the inner and outer surfaces must sum to zero. So if the inner surface is -q, the outer must be +q. Because conductor is neutral, the total charge is zero. So yeah, inner is -q, outer is +q.

But the question is about the electric field at a point P outside the conductor. So point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor. The problem gives some other distances: l is the distance from the center of
