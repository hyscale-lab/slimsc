Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanet transits and their probabilities. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

So the question is about two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have the same mass, detected via RV method. RV gives us the minimum mass, but since they're Earth-like, I guess we can assume their masses are known accurately. They have circular orbits, which probably simplifies things.

The orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than Planet_2's. So if Planet_2's period is P, Planet_1's is P/3. That means Planet_1 is closer to its star because shorter period implies closer orbit, right? Because of Kepler's third law: P² is proportional to a³/(M), where M is the star's mass. Wait, but the host stars have different masses. Planet_1's star is twice as massive as Planet_2's. So even though Planet_1 has a shorter period, the actual semi-major axis depends on both the period and the star's mass.

Wait, the key here is the probability of a transit. The transit probability depends on the relative size of the planet and the star, and the orbital inclination. Oh, and the size of the orbit—larger orbits have smaller chances because the planet's path is a smaller fraction of the sky. Or wait, no, wait. The probability of transit is actually higher when the planet's orbit is edge-on, but that's the same for all planets around the same star. But also, the size of the star's disk relative to the planet's orbital distance affects the probability.

The formula for transit probability is roughly (R_star / a) * (something else?), where a is the semi-major axis. Oh wait, I think the main factor is the ratio of the star's radius to the semi-major axis. Because the planet's path relative to the star's disk is a chord, and the probability is the ratio of the area where the planet can pass in front of the star to the total area. But perhaps more accurately, the probability is proportional to (R_star / a), assuming that the orbital plane is randomly oriented. Or wait, maybe it's (R_star / a) multiplied by an inclination factor, but since both planets are equally likely to have any inclination, the inclination factors would average out. So the probability is proportional to R_star / a.

Wait, but wait, when I've read about this before, I remember that the transit probability is approximately (R_star + R_planet) / a. But since Earth-like planets are much smaller than stars, R_planet is negligible. So it's roughly R_star / a.

But another thought: a is the semi-major axis. So, for each planet, we need to calculate R_star / a, and the planet with a higher ratio would have a higher probability of transiting.

Wait, but the star's radius is the same for both. Oh, the question says both host stars have the same radii. Oh, that's an important point. So R_star is the same for both planets.

So the probability is proportional to 1/a for each planet. So the planet with a smaller a will have a higher probability of transiting because 1/a is larger.

So now I need to find the semi-major axes of each planet.

Using Kepler's third law: P² = (4π²/G(M)) a³. Rearranged, a³ = (G M P²)/(4π²). So a is proportional to (M P²)^(1/3). Because G and other constants are the same for both.

So for Planet_1: M1 = 2 M2. Because Planet_1's star is twice as massive as Planet_2's. Let me denote M2 as the mass of Planet_2's star, so M1 = 2 M2.

The orbital period of Planet_1 is P1 = (1/3) P2, since it's three times shorter.

So a1 = [ (G * 2 M2) * (P1)^2 / (4π²) ) ]^(1/3)
= [ (2 M2) * ( (P2/3) )^2 ) ]^(1/3) * (G/(4π²))^(1/3)

= [ 2 M2 * P2² / 9 ) ]^(1/3)

= ( (2/9) M2 P2² )^(1/3 )

Similarly, a2 is [ (G M2) * P2^2 / (4π^2) ) ]^(1/3)
= ( M2 P2² )^(1/3 )

So the ratio a1/a2 = [ (2/9) / 1 ]^(1/3 ) = (2/9)^(1/3) ≈ (0.222)^(1/3) ≈ 0.6 something. Hmm.

Wait, wait, let me do it more accurately. (2/9) is approximately 0.2222. The cube root of 0.2222 is about 0.606. So a1 is about 0.606 times a2.

Alternatively, a1 = a2 * (2/9)^(1/3).

But wait, since a is proportional to (M P²)^(1/3), maybe I should compute the ratio a1/a2.

a1/a2 = [ ( M1 * P1² ) / (M2 * P2²) ) ]^(1/3 )

M1 is 2 M2, P1 is (1/3) P2.

So substituting:

(2 M2 * (P2/3)^2 ) / (M2 * P2^2 ) )^(1/3)
= ( 2 * (P2² /9 ) ) / P2² )^(1/3)
= ( 2/(9) )^(1/3)
Which is the same as before.

So a1 is (2/9)^(1/3) times a2. So a1 is smaller than a2. Because (2/9) is less than 1, so the cube root is less than 1.

So since a1 < a2, and the transit probability is proportional to R_star / a, and R_star is same for both, R_star/a would be larger for a1 than a2.

So Planet_1's probability is (R/a1) and Planet_2's is (R/a2). Since a1 < a2, R/a1 > R/a2. So Planet_1 has a higher probability.

Wait, but I thought a is semi-major axis. Let me make sure I'm not getting that reversed. Because if a planet is closer (smaller a), the transit probability is higher because the path is more likely to cross the star's disk. Yes.

So Planet_1 has a smaller a, so higher probability.

Now, the question is, what's the ratio of their probabilities?

Probability_1 / Probability_2 = (R/a1) / (R/a2) ) = a2 / a1.

Because R is same, so it's (a2/a1).

We found a1/a2 = (2/9)^(1/3). So a2/a1 = (9/2)^(1/3) ≈ cube root of 4.5.

What's cube root of 4.5? Let's think: 1.5^3 is 3.375. 1.6^3 is 4.096. 1.65^3 is approximately 4.489. Oh, wait, that's close to 4.5.

So (9/2)=4.5, cube root is ~1.65.

So a2/a1 ≈1.65. So Probability_1/Probability_2 = 1.65.

Wait, no. Wait: Probability_1 is proportional to R/a1, and Probability_2 is proportional to R/a2.

So the ratio is (R/a1)/(R/a2) ) = a2/(a1).

So if a2 is 1.65 times a1, then Probability_1 is 1.65 times higher than Probability_2. So Planet_1 has a higher probability.

So the researchers would prefer to observe Planet_1 because it has a higher probability of transiting.

Wait, but looking at the options, let's see:

Option C says Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability.

Option D: ~2.7 times higher.

So according to this, the ratio is about 1.65. So the correct choice would be C.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations.

Wait, the ratio a1/a2 is (2/9)^(1/3) = (2)^1/3 / (9)^1/3.

Wait, 9 is 3². So 9^(1/3)=3^(2/3)= about 2.08.

2^(1/3) is about 1.26.

So a1/a2 = 1.26 / 2.08 ≈ 0.605. So a1 = ~0.605 a2.

So a2/a1 = 1 / 0.605 ≈ 1.65. So the transit probability ratio is 1.65.

So Planet_1's probability is 1.65 times higher than Planet_2's, so they should choose Planet_1.

Looking back at the options:

C) Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher probability to transit.

Yes, that's option C.


To determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting, we analyze the transit probability formula, which is proportional to \( \frac{R_{\text{star}}}{a} \), where \( R_{\text{star}} \) is the radius of the host star and \( a \) is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Since both host stars have the same radius (\( R_{\text{star}} \)), the probability of a transit depends on the semi-major axis \( a \). A smaller \( a \) results in a higher transit probability.

Using Kepler's third law, the semi-major axis \( a \) is proportional to \( (M P^2)^{1/3} \), where \( M \) is the mass of the host star and \( P \) is the orbital period of the planet. For Planet_1 and Planet_2:

- Planet_1's host star has a mass \( M_1 = 2M_2 \), where \( M_2 \) is the mass of Planet_2's host star.
- Planet_1's orbital period is \( P_1 = \frac{1}{3}P_2 \).

Substituting these values into the formula for \( a \), we calculate the ratio of the semi-major axes:

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left( \frac{M_1 P_1^2}{M_2 P_2^2} \right)^{1/3} = \left( \frac{2M_2 \left(\frac{P_2}{3}\right)^2}{M_2 P_2^2} \right)^{1/3} = \left( \frac{2}{9} \right)^{1/3}.
\]

The cube root of \( \frac{2}{9} \) is approximately \( 0.605 \), so \( a_1 \approx 0.605a_2 \). This means Planet_1 has a smaller semi-major axis and a higher transit probability compared to Planet_2.

The transit probability ratio is given by:

\[
\frac{\text{Probability}_1}{\text{Probability}_2} = \frac{R_{\text{star}}/a_1}{R_{\text{star}}/a_2} = \frac{a_2}{a_1}.
\]

Since \( a_1 \approx 0.605a_2 \), the probability ratio is:

\[
\frac{\text{Probability}_1}{\text{Probability}_2} = \frac{1}{0.605} \approx 1.65.
\]

Thus, Planet_1 has approximately 1.65 times the transit probability of Planet_2. The researchers should prioritize observing Planet_1.

**Option Analysis:**

- **B)** Incorrect. The transit probability ratio is not 1.5 times.
- **C)** Correct. Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher transit probability.
- **D)** Incorrect. The transit probability ratio is not 2.7 times.
