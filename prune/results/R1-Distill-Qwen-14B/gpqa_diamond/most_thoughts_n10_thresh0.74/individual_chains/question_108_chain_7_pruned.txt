Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about comparing the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy of a hydrogen atom. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my quantum mechanics, but let's try to think this through.

The question says the magnetic field B is parallel to Oz, and it's 1 Tesla. Oh right, magnetic fields can affect atoms through various effects, like the Zeeman effect maybe? And it's paramagnetic coupling. So I remember that paramagnetism arises from the magnetic moments of electrons, which are due to their spin. So the coupling term would be some interaction between the magnetic moment and the external field.

The orbital magnetic quantum number m is small. Wait, m can be -1, 0, +1 for the 2p orbitals, I think. So small m values mean the effect might be more significant in certain terms. But wait, paramagnetic coupling is usually about spin-orbit interaction, right? Or wait, maybe it's about the Zeeman effect splitting the energy levels based on m. But paramagnetic coupling specifically refers to the interaction between the magnetic moment due to electron spin and the external field. Oh wait, no, maybe it's the spin-orbit coupling. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, the problem says 'paramagnetic coupling term'. Paramagnetic materials have their magnetic moments due to unpaired electrons. So the coupling term in the Hamiltonian would be something like H = -μ·B, where μ is the magnetic moment. The magnetic moment for an electron is μ = -gμ_B m_s, where g is the Landé factor, μ_B is the Bohr magneton, and m_s is the spin quantum number.

Wait, but the orbital magnetic quantum number is m. So I think the paramagnetic coupling term would be the Zeeman term. So the energy due to the magnetic field would be proportional to m times B. Because the Zeeman effect splits the energy levels based on m. So the energy shift ΔE_zeeman is given by something like ΔE = m * μ_B * B, but wait, μ_B is the Bohr magneton, which comes from the electron's orbit, but wait, no, the orbital term is different from the spin term. Oh, right, the orbital contribution is μ_orbital = m_l * μ_B, and the spin is μ_spin = m_s * g_s μ_B, where g_s is the Landé g-factor (~2).

Wait, but in this problem, since it's paramagnetic coupling, which is due to the electron's spin, so the coupling term would be the spin part, i.e., H = -μ·B. So the energy shift would be proportional to m_s multiplied by something involving B.

But wait, the question says m is small. Wait, m is the orbital magnetic quantum number, but paramagnetic coupling is spin-based. Hmm, maybe the question is mixing terms? Or perhaps it's considering the orbital contribution as well. I'm a bit confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps the paramagnetic coupling refers to the spin-orbit interaction, but that's a different term. Wait, spin-orbit coupling is a perturbation that causes shifts due to the interaction between the electron's spin and its orbital motion. But that's separate from the external magnetic field.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the Zeeman effect, which is when an external magnetic field causes the energy levels to split. So the paramagnetic coupling term here refers to the Zeeman term in the Hamiltonian. So the energy shift would be H_Zeeman = - μ · B, where μ is the magnetic moment.

So let's calculate that. The magnetic moment due to spin is μ = g_s μ_B m_s. And μ_B is the Bohr magneton, which is (eħ)/(2m_e), approximately 9.274×10^-24 J/T.

Given that, the energy shift would be H = - μ · B = -g_s μ_B m_s B. Wait, but the orbital magnetic quantum number is m, so perhaps m here refers to the orbital m (m_l) not the spin m_s. Wait, no, m is given as the orbital magnetic quantum number. So maybe the paramagnetic coupling is considering the orbital contribution. Hmm, but paramagnetism is more about spin, not orbital contributions. But maybe in this context, it's considering the orbital effect.

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let's proceed step by step.

First, calculate the paramagnetic coupling energy term. Let's denote this as H_p.

H_p = μ_B * m * B, where μ_B is the Bohr magneton, m is the orbital magnetic quantum number, and B is the magnetic field.

Wait, but the orbital magnetic moment is μ_orbital = m_l * μ_B. So the energy shift from the Zeeman effect for orbital is E_orbital = - μ_orbital · B.

But for an electron, the spin magnetic moment is μ_spin = -g_s μ_B m_s, so the energy is E_spin = - μ_spin · B.

But paramagnet
