Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Hmm, let's see what the question says. 

So, there are three exoplanets: Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3. They were discovered using the TTV method, which I think stands for transit timing variations. But I'm not sure how that method affects this particular problem. Maybe it's just context.

The problem gives me the ratios of their equilibrium temperatures. Between Planet1 and Planet2, the ratio is about 1.4. So Planet2's equilibrium temperature is 1.4 times that of Planet1. And between Planet2 and Planet3, the ratio is 2.3. So Planet3 is 2.3 times hotter than Planet2, or wait, wait. Wait, equilibrium temperature usually depends on the distance from the star and the star's luminosity. The formula I remember is something like T = T_star * (L/L_sun)^(1/4) * (a/(1 AU))^-0.5. Or wait, another formula: Te = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) ), but I might be mixing things up.

Wait, let's think. The equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the semi-major axis (assuming same star and albedo). So if a planet is farther from the star, its equilibrium temperature is lower. Because T_eq is proportional to (L/(16πσ a²))^(1/4), so T_eq is inversely proportional to sqrt(a). So, T_eq ∝ 1/sqrt(a).

Wait, but the given ratios are T1/T2=1.4 and T2/T3=2.3. Wait, no, wait. The question says: the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.4. So, is it T1/T2 = 1.4, or T2/T1 = 1.4? The wording is a bit unclear. Oh, wait, the question says "the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.4." Hmm, that could be interpreted either way. But let's think about the context. If Planet2 is hotter than Planet1, then T2 > T1, so the ratio T2/T1 would be greater than 1. So maybe the ratio is T1/T2 = 1.4, meaning Planet2 is hotter. Wait, but the way it's written is "the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.4." So that's Planet1's temperature divided by Planet2's? Or the other way around?

Wait, if the ratio is 1.4, which is greater than 1, and if Planet2 is hotter than Planet1, then T2 would be larger. So the ratio T1/T2 would be less than 1, so that can't be. So perhaps the ratio is T2/T1 is 1.4, making Planet2 hotter. Hmm, but the wording isn't entirely clear. Or maybe the ratio is T1 over T2 is 1.4, meaning Planet1 is hotter than Planet2. But I think the TTV method is more about perturbations, but maybe that's not directly
