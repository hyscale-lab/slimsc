Okay, so I've got this question about the entropy of a supermassive black hole. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step. I remember that the entropy of a black hole is related to its area, thanks to the Bekenstein-Hawking formula. The formula is something like S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B), where A is the area of the event horizon, c is the speed of light, ħ is the reduced Planck constant, G is the gravitational constant, and k_B is Boltzmann's constant.

Wait, right, so first I need to find the radius of the event horizon, then calculate the area, and then plug that into the entropy formula. But wait, how do I find the radius? Oh, because we're given the angular size θ and the distance d to the black hole. I think the angular size is given by θ ≈ R / d, but wait, only when R is much smaller than d, right? Because for small angles, tan θ ≈ θ in radians. So yes, R = d * θ (in radians).

So first, converting θ from degrees to radians. θ is 1e-17 degrees. Let me calculate that. 1 degree is π/180 radians, so θ ≈ 1e-17 * π / 180. Let me compute that. Let's see, π is approximately 3.1416, so 3.1416/(180) is about 0.01745. So θ ≈ 1e-17 * 0.01745 ≈ 1.745e-19 radians.

Wait, but actually, I can probably approximate θ in radians as approximately 1.7e-19 for calculation purposes. Then, distance d is 1e10 parsecs. I need to convert parsecs to meters because the entropy formula uses SI units. One parsec is about 3.086e16 meters. So d = 1e10 parsecs = 1e10 * 3.086e16 m. Let's compute that: 1e10 * 3.086e16 = 3.086e26 meters.

So R = d * θ. Plugging in the numbers: R ≈ 3.086e26 m * 1.745e-19 rad. Let me calculate that: 3.086e26 * 1.745e-19 = (3.086 * 1.745) * 1e7. Let's compute 3.086 * 1.745. Hmm, 3 * 1.7 is 5.1, so maybe around 5.37 (exact calculation: 3.086 * 1.745. Let me see, 3 * 1.745 is 5.235, 0.086 *1.745 ≈ 0.150. So total is approximately 5.385). So R ≈ 5.385e7 meters, which is 5.385e7 m.

Wait, alternatively, maybe I should have been more precise with the calculation, but maybe an order of magnitude is sufficient. So R is about 5e7 meters. Or 5.4e7 meters, but that's a minor point.

Now, the area A of the event horizon is 4πR². Let's compute R squared. (5.4e7 m)^2 = (5.4)^2 * 1e14 = about 29.16e14 m². So A = 4π * 29.16e14 = approx 4 * 3.1416 * 29.16e14.

Calculating 4 * 3.1416 ≈12.566, so 12.566 * 29.16e14 ≈ 366.3e14 m². So A ≈ 3.663e16 m².

Wait, wait, no, 29.16e14 is 2.916e15? Wait, 5.4e7 squared is (5.4)^2 * (1e7)^2 = 29.16 * 1e14 = 2.916e15 m². Oh, right! So R² is 2.916e15, so A is 4π * 2.916e15. Let me compute that more accurately.

4π is about 12.566. So 12.566 * 2.916e15 ≈ 36.63e15 m², which is 3.663e16 m².

Wait, that seems a bit off because the Schwarzschild radius R_s is 2GM/c². Wait, but maybe I'm okay so far. Now, the area is 4π R_s², right. So moving on.

Now, the entropy S is (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B). Let me write down the constants:

ħ (hbar) is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

G is 6.6743e-11 m³ kg⁻¹ s⁻².

k_B (Boltzmann constant) is 1.380649e-23 J/K.

c is about 3e8 m/s.

So putting it all together: S = (A c^3) / (4 ħ G k_B) 

Wait, but wait. Let me think, the formula. Oh wait, the formula is S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B) ? Or is it (A)/(4 ħ G) multiplied by (c^3)/(k_B) ?

Wait, I think the correct formula is S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B). Alternatively, the Hawking formula is S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B) multiplied by some numerical factor, but perhaps the exact scaling is correct.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me just make sure I'm getting the formula right. According to Bekenstein-Hawking entropy, S is proportional to the area A of the event horizon, and the formula is S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B) * (1/(4π)) ? Wait no, let me double-check. The exact formula is S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B) times some constants.

Wait, upon checking, the formula is S = (A c³)/(4 ħ G k_B) * (1/(4 π)) ?

Wait, perhaps not. Wait, the formula is S = (A c³)/(4 ħ G k_B) * (1/(4π))? No, I think the correct formula is S = (A c³) / (4 ħ G k_B) * (1/(4π))? Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Alternatively, perhaps I should look up the exact formula.

Wait, no, I think the correct formula is S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B) * (1/(4 π)) is not correct. Let me get it right. The Bekenstein-Hawking entropy formula is S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B) * (1/(4 π)) ?

Wait, no, I think that's incorrect. Let me think: The area A is 16 π (G M c^{-2})^2. So A = 16 π (G M/(c²))^2.

Then, the entropy is S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B) * (1/(4 π)) ?

Wait, perhaps I should just find the formula correctly. The correct formula is S = (A c^
