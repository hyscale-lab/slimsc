Okay, so I have this physics problem about stars and their effective temperatures. Hmm, let me try to think through it step by step.

The question says that iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh right, the energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. And the photospheres are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), so I can probably use the Boltzmann distribution here.

Wait, Boltzmann distribution relates the population of different energy levels in a system. The formula is something like the ratio of populations in two states. Right, the formula is n_i/n_j = (g_i/g_j) * exp( - (E_i - E_j)/(k T) ). 

In this case, star_1 has twice as many excited atoms as star_2. So, n1 = 2 * n2. Or is it that the excitation is higher in star_1, meaning the population of the higher energy level is twice that of star_2's? Let me think: the energy difference is between two levels. Let's say E2 is higher than E1 by delta E. So for each star, the population in E2 is proportional to g2 * exp(-delta E / (k T)).

So for star_1, the ratio n1 (E2) / n1 (E1) = (g2/g1) * exp(-delta E/(k T1))
And for star_2, it's n2 (E2)/n2 (E1) = (g2/g1) * exp(-delta E/(k T2))

Wait, but the problem says that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. Maybe that refers to the ratio of the populations of the excited state to the ground state. So star_1's excited population is twice that of star_2. So n1_excited / n1_ground = 2 * (n2_excited / n2_ground )

So (n1_excited / n1_ground) = 2 * (n2_excited / n2_ground )

From Boltzmann, n_excited/n_ground = exp(-delta E/(k T)) assuming g's are same or same ratio for both. Wait, but the problem states that the energy levels are the same, so the statistical weights (g) would be the same for both stars. So the g factors cancel out.

So for each star, n_excited/n_ground = exp( - delta E/(k T) )

So for star_1: (n1_excited / n1_ground ) = exp( - delta E/(k T1) )

Similarly for star_2: (n2_excited / n2_ground )
