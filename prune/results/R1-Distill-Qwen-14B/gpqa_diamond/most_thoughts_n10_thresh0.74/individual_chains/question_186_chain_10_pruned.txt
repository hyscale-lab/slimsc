Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about the Cope rearrangement. Hmm, I remember that the Cope rearrangement involves 1,5-dienes undergoing a [3,3] sigmatropic rearrangement. Let me think about how that works.

The compound given is (1S,4R)-2-vinyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene. Wait, that's a mouthful. Let's break it down. Bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane is a norbornane structure, right? So it's a norbornene derivative. The substituents are a vinyl group and an azabicyclo, so I think the structure has a nitrogen in it.

So, the molecule is a bicyclic compound with a double bond. The substituents are on the 2-position: a vinyl group and an azabicyclo. Wait, no, the structure is 2-vinyl and 2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene. Oh, right, so the 2-position has both a vinyl group and an azabicyclo group? Maybe not. Wait, bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene is the base structure. So the 5-position is a double bond. But wait, the molecule is named 2-vinyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene. So the 2-position has a vinyl group and an azabicy
