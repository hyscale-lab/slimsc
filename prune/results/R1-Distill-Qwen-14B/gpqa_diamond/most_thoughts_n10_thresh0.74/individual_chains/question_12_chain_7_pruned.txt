Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem states: Find the kinetic energy of the product particles in the decay Pi(+) = mu(+) + nu. Here, Pi(+) is stationary. The rest masses are given as 139.6 MeV for the Pi(+) and 105.7 MeV for the mu(+). The options are A to D, each giving two values which I assume are the kinetic energies of the muon and the neutrino.

Hmm, right. So this is a particle decay problem. Since the pion is at rest, the products (muon and neutrino) must move in opposite directions to conserve momentum, I think. But wait, neutrinos are tricky because they have very little mass. Oh wait, actually, in the standard model, neutrinos are considered to have negligible mass, but in reality, they do have some. But for this problem, I think they'll treat the neutrino's mass as zero. So, the muon is the only one with significant mass.

Wait, but in the decay, the pion is at rest, so the initial momentum is zero. Therefore, the total momentum after decay must also be zero. So the muon and the neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta. Let me think: that means their momenta magnitudes are equal, but directions are opposite. So if the muon has momentum p, the neutrino has -p.

Now, since the neutrino is massless (or at least treated as such here), its energy would be equal to its momentum times c (but since we're using MeV and such units, maybe we can ignore the c as it's incorporated into the units). But wait, actually, energy-momentum relation is E² = (pc)² + (m c²)². So for the neutrino, E = pc, because m=0. For the muon, E = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m_mu c²)^2 ). But since the pion is decaying into these two particles, the total energy must be conserved.

Wait, the pion is at rest, so its energy is just its rest mass energy: E_pi = m_pi c² = 139.6 MeV. The muon and neutrino's total energy must add up to
