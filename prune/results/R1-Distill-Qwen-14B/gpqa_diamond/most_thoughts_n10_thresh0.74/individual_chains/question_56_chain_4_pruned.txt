Okay, so I've got this question about the hydrogen atom and transitions between energy levels. Hmm, I remember that when an electron transitions between energy levels, certain selection rules apply. Let me think about what those are.

The question is about the |3,0,0> state decaying to |1,0,0> via two dipole transitions. Wait, dipole transitions... right, the dipole selection rules. So, for electric dipole transitions, the selection rules are Δl = ±1 and Δm = 0, ±1. Oh, and Δn can be any integer, but I think in most cases, n changes by 1 because of the energy differences? Or wait, no, it's allowed to change by more, as long as the other rules are followed.

Wait, the initial state is |3,0,0>, which means n=3, l=0 (s orbital), m=0. It's decaying to |1,0,0>, so n goes from 3 to 1. That's a two-step change, but since each transition is dipole, each step must follow the selection rules.

So, first, the first transition would be from n=3, l=0 to some state with l=1, because l has to change by ±1. Because l was 0, it can only go to l=1. So the first transition must be to a state with l=1. Then, from that state, another transition to l=0, because the final state is l=0.

So, the first transition is from |3,0,0> to |2,1, m>, right? Because n can change by 2? Because 3→2 is a change of 1 in n, but wait, no, n can change by any number as long as the other rules are followed. Wait, but for hydrogen, each energy level's state is determined by n and l, but the transition is allowed if Δl=±1. So, from l=0, it can go to l=1.

So the first step must be to a state with n=2, l=1, because from n=3 to n=2 is a change in n by 1. Or could it go to n=1? But wait, n=3 to n=1 would require a Δn of -2. Hmm, but each transition must obey the selection rules for dipole.
