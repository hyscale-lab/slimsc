Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about electrons in p orbitals. Hmm, let me try to parse this out step by step. 

The question says that two electrons are in a p orbital angular momentum state. Wait, p orbitals have angular momentum quantum number l=1. Oh right, because s is 0, p is 1, d is 2, etc. So each electron has l1=1 and l2=1.

The coupled angular momentum state is given as |l1, l2, l, m> = |1,1,2,-1>. So, total angular momentum quantum number l is 2, and the m value is -1. 

We're ignoring spin angular momentum, so we're only dealing with the orbital part here. The problem is asking about the joint probability of measuring both L₁z and L₂z to be -ħ. So each L_z measurement for each electron gives -ħ.

Wait, L_z for each electron is m multiplied by ħ. Wait, no, wait. The orbital angular momentum quantum number is l, so each Lz eigenvalue is mħ for each electron. So for each electron, when you measure L_z, you get mħ. But in this problem, each L_z (for each electron) is being measured. So the question is, what is the probability that both L1z and L2z are measured as -ħ each.

So each L_z is measured as -ħ. Let me think about this. Each electron has l=1, so m can be -1, 0, +1. So for each electron's L_z, possible outcomes are -ħ, 0, +ħ.

In the coupled state |1,1,2,-1>, what do the individual m₁ and m₂ values look like? Because m is the sum of m₁ and m₂, right? Because total angular momentum m = m₁ + m₂. So in this state, m is -1. So m₁ + m₂ = -1.

We're looking for the probability that both m₁ and m₂ are -1, because that would make their L_z measurements -ħ each. Because m is -1 for each, so L_z for each is -ħ.

Wait, but for two electrons, the total m is m₁ + m₂ = -1. So if both m₁ and m₂ are -1, that adds up
