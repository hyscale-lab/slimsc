Okay, so I've got this question about creating a mouse embryonic chimera using induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Let me try to break it down and figure it out step by step. 

First, the setup: The researcher is using iPSCs from various somatic tissues. These cells are labeled with mRaspberry, which I think is a fluorescent marker, probably red. The labeling is under a lineage-specific promoter, meaning that the red signal will only show up in certain cell types, depending on their lineage. 

They inject these dedifferentiated cells into a blastocyst at the 32-cell stage. Then, they track them over 48 hours. Every 12 hours, they prepare embryos with TUNEL-FITC staining and observe under a confocal microscope. 

The question is about what the first thing they notice is. The options are A to D. 

Hmm, I need to remember what each of these techniques does. TUNEL is Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling, right? It's used to detect DNA fragmentation in apoptotic cells. So when a cell is undergoing apoptosis, the DNA breaks down, and TUNEL can label the breaks. The FITC is a fluorescent tag, so the TUNEL-positive cells will show up as green.

The iPSCs are labeled with mRaspberry, which is a red fluorescent protein. They're under a lineage-specific promoter, so depending on the cell type's lineage, the red signal will appear. So if the iPSCs are contributing to certain tissues, the red will show in those areas.

When the cells are injected into the blastocyst, they should integrate into the embryo and start differentiating. Over time, the red signals should appear in the various tissues based on their origin. 

The question is about the first observation. So what happens first when you inject these cells and then do the TUNEL staining? 

Wait, the process goes like this: 
1. Inject iPSCs into blastocyst.
2. Let the embryo develop.
3. At each 12-hour mark, they do TUNEL-FITC staining and look under the microscope.

So, each time, they're looking for apoptosis (green) and the iPSC-derived cells (red). 

I think the first thing they might notice is where the iPSCs are localizing and whether they're undergoing apoptosis. Since iPSCs are pluripotent, they should be able to integrate and differentiate into various cell types. But when you inject them into a blastocyst, are they immediately contributing to the embryo, or do they take some time to settle in?

Wait, but the question is about the first observation. So maybe the initial stages... Let's think about when the TUNEL staining would show up. TUNEL is for apoptosis. If the iPSCs are being injected into the blastocyst, perhaps some of them are undergoing stress and dying, hence showing up as green. But that's a possibility.

But wait, another angle: the iPSCs are labeled with mRaspberry under a lineage-specific promoter. So, initially, when they're undifferentiated, perhaps the promoter isn't active, so the red signal isn't present.
