Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, I remember that stability constants (beta) tell us how stable a complex is. The higher the beta, the more stable the complex.

The question is about finding the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species. The options are given, and I need to figure out which one is correct.

Let me think. The solution has Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-) ions. The concentrations are c(Co) = 10^-2 M and [SCN-] = 0.1 M. The stability constants are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. Wait, I need to make sure I know which complex corresponds to each beta. Usually, βn is for the complex with n ligands. So β1 would be Co(SCN), β2 would be [Co(SCN)2]^2+, and so on. But wait, the problem statement says the stability constants are for the complexes, but I'm not sure about the order. Oh wait, the question mentions dithiocyanato, which is two SCN- ligands. So the blue complex is likely the [Co(SCN)2]^2+ complex, which corresponds to the second beta, β2=40. Wait, but the given β3 is 63. Wait, maybe I should think about the possible complexes.

Wait, the complexes are probably Co(SCN)^(n−), and each beta represents the formation from the previous one. So, the formation constants (stability constants) are for each step. So β1 is the formation of CoSCN^+, β2 is for [Co(SCN)2]^2+, β3 for [Co(SCN)3]^3−, and β4 for [Co(SCN)4]^4−. So each beta is for the next step adding a SCN−.

Wait, but the question is about the dithiocyanato complex, which would be [Co(SCN)₂]²+. But wait, I think the problem specifies the blue dithiocyanate complex, which I believe is [Co(SCN)₂]^2+. So β2 is 40. But wait, another thought—what if the stability constants are given for each complex's overall stability, not stepwise? Like β1 is for [Co
