Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let's see what it's about. The question is about pericyclic reactions, specifically sigmatropic rearrangements. I remember that sigmatropic rearrangements involve the shift of a sigma bond along with a pi bond. The classic examples are the Cope and Claisen rearrangements. These reactions are usually thermodynamically controlled because they form more stable products.

The question has three parts, and each part involves a reaction that should undergo a sigmatropic rearrangement. I need to figure out the products A, B, and C based on the given reactants and conditions. Then, match them with the options provided.

Let me tackle each reaction one by one.

First Reaction:
1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine + but-3-en-2-ol + H+ and Heat â†’ A.

Hmm. The starting material is 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine. That's like a molecule where a ethanamine (CH2CH2NH2) has two methoxy groups on the same carbon as the amine. So it's (CH3O)2CHNH2. Wait, no, 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine would be NH2C(OCH3)2. Because ethanamine is CH3CH2NH2. Wait, no, the ethanamine would have two carbons. So 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine is O

Wait, the structure of 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine is probably CH2OCH3-OCH3 with the amine on the same carbon. Wait, maybe it's (methoxy)2CH-NH2. So the structure is (OCH3)2CH-NH2. So that's a primary amine with two methoxy groups on the adjacent carbon.

The other reactant is but-3-en-2-ol. So the structure is CH2CH(OH)CH2CH3? Wait, no. Wait, but-3-en-2-ol would be CH2=CHCH(OH)CH3? No, but wait, but-3-en-2-ol: the double bond is between C3 and C4? Wait, but butenol is four carbons. So,
