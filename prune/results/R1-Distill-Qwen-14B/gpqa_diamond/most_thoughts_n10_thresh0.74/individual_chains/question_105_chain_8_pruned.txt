Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this stuff, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the question again.

The problem is about a star with the same radius as the Sun. One hemisphere has dark spots covering 20% of that hemisphere. The star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are 1000K cooler. Because the star is rotating, these spots will come into and go out of view, causing brightness variations that might look like an exoplanet transit. The question is asking, what's the radius of an exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation if the star wasn't spotted.

Hmm, so I think the key here is to compare the change in brightness caused by the spots to the change that would be caused by a planet transiting the star. Both situations cause dips in brightness, but for different reasons—spots modulate brightness due to temperature differences, while a planet blocks some light.

Let's break down what I know. First, the star has a radius equal to the Sun, Rstar = R_sun. The spot coverage is 20% on one hemisphere. So each hemisphere is a sphere, right? The area of a hemisphere is 2πR², but since the coverage is a part of it, the total spotted area is 0.2 * (hemisphere area). Wait, but wait, the problem says one hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%. So the filling factor is 0.2, meaning 20% of that hemisphere's surface is covered.

Wait no, the filling factor is 20% of each spot, but the spots cover a certain fraction of the hemisphere. Wait, no, the question says the spots have a filling factor of 20%. Filling factor is the fraction of the area of a spot that is covered. Or wait, is it the fraction of the hemisphere that is spotted? Hmm, maybe I need to clarify that. Oh, wait, the 'filling factor' typically refers to the fraction of a spot's surface area that is covered by magnetic regions (like in sunspots). But I'm not sure. Alternatively, sometimes the filling factor refers to the fraction of the stellar surface that is covered by spots.

Wait, the question says 'the spots exhibit a temperature difference of 1000K.' So the star's Teff is 6000K, spots are 5000K. Because it's a temperature difference of 1000K cooler.

So when the spots rotate into and out of view, the observed brightness changes. The brightness variation is due to the spots being cooler. So when the spots are on the side facing us, the star appears slightly dimmer, as those cooler regions contribute less light.

The problem says that the observed brightness variation is similar to that of an exoplanet transit. So when a planet transits the star, it blocks some light proportional to the area of the planet relative to the star. The dip in brightness is (R_planet / R_star)^2, since the area is proportional to the square of the radius.

But in this case, the dip is due to spots. So we need to calculate the amplitude of
