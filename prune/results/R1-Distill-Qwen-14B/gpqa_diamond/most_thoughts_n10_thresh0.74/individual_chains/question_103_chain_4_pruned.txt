Alright, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene. Hmm, okay, let's break this down.

First, the target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So that means the benzene ring has substituents at the 3 and 5 positions. Specifically, a bromo group and a nitro group, and the ketone (ethan-1-one) group attached to the ring in the 1 position. Wait, actually, wait. Ethan-1-one would be a ketone where the carbonyl is attached to a methyl group, right? So ethan-1-one is acetone, but in this case, it's attached to the benzene ring. So the structure is a benzene ring with a ketone (C=O) at position 1, a bromo at 3, and nitro at 5.

Wait, but benzene is a six-membered ring, so numbering would be such that the substituents are at positions 1, 3, and 5. Wait, but the molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So the phenyl group is attached to the ethanone. So the structure is a phenyl ring with substituents at positions 3 and 5 (bromo and nitro), and the phenyl is attached at position 1 to a ketone. So the benzene ring has substituents at positions 1, 3, and 5? Or wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, ethan-1-one is (propan-2-one), which is (CH3)2CO. But wait, no: ethan-1-one would be CH3CO, but that's not possible because that's an aldehyde. Oh wait, no: I think I got that wrong. Ethan-1-one is actually an aldehyde, but that's not possible as a ketone. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Wait, the IUPAC nomenclature for ketones. The longest chain should include the carbonyl group. So ethan-1-one would be (CH3)CO- something. Wait, perhaps the correct
