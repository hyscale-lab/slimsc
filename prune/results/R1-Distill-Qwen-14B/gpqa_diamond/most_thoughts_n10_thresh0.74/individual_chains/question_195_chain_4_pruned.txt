Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Let me try to understand what's being asked. So, we've got two planets. The first one is Earth-sized, with a radius of 1 Earth radius. It's orbiting a star that's 1.5 times the Sun's radius. The transit impact parameter is 0.2, and the orbital period is 3 days. Now, the question is about a second planet, which has a radius of 2.5 Earth radii. We need to find the maximum orbital period of this second planet so that it can both transit and occult the star, assuming it's in the same plane and has a circular orbit.

Hmm, wait. Both transit and occultation events. So, transit is when the planet passes in front of the star from our perspective, and occultation is when the planet passes behind the star, causing a dip in the combined brightness as the planet is blocked by the star. But wait, occultation refers to the planet moving behind the star, so the brightness goes down because we're no longer seeing the planet's reflected light. But for both events to happen, the orbital period of the second planet must be such that it's in the correct position relative to the first planet's orbit.

Wait, no, wait. Oh, no, perhaps I got it wrong. The problem is about both transit and occultation events for the second planet as seen from Earth. So, for a planet to transit, it must pass in front of the star, and to occult, it must pass behind. But for these events to both occur, the orbital periods of the two planets must be such that their orbital motions cause them to align correctly. Oh, but wait, the transit and occultation events would happen when the planet is moving along its orbit. So, for the second planet, to be able to transit (when it's in front) and occult (when it's behind) from our viewpoint, the orbital period needs to allow for these alignments.

Wait, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe the key is to ensure that the second planet's orbit is such that it can transit the star. Because occultation events (when the planet is behind the star) would occur regardless, but for both to be observable, the planet must be in the correct position relative to the star and observer. But I'm not entirely sure about that.

Wait, perhaps the problem is about the other planet's orbit allowing it to both
