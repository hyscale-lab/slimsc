Okay, so I have this physics problem here. Let me try to understand it step by step. So, the question is about particles being collided in a spherical detector. These particles produce new types that decay quickly, and they travel at ultra-relativistic velocities. The problem gives me some information and asks me to find the required Lorentz factor for a different scenario.

Let me read the details again carefully. The detector has a radius of 30 meters. Currently, when particles are collided, on average one third of these fast-decaying particles reach the inner walls of the detector. The problem states that the Lorentz factor is around 20 in this case. Now, they're asking what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of the particles reach the inner walls.

Hmm, so I think this has to do with the lifetime of the particles and how far they travel before decaying. Because if the particles are moving at a high speed, they might live longer due to time dilation, allowing more of them to reach the detector walls.

Wait, wait. Let me think. The particles are produced at the center of the detector. The detector is a sphere with radius 30 meters, so the particles have to travel 30 meters to reach the wall. 

Ultra-relativistic particles are moving at speeds close to the speed of light, so their velocity v is approximately c. The Lorentz factor gamma is given by gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Since they're moving at ultra-relativistic speeds, gamma is large.

The time it takes for a particle to reach the wall is the distance divided by velocity. So t = R / v. But due to time dilation, the proper time experienced by the particle is t' = t / gamma. 

The decay rate depends on the particle's lifetime. Suppose the particles have a proper lifetime tau (the lifetime measured in their rest frame). The actual lifetime in the lab frame is gamma * tau. So the particles will decay if the time they take to travel (t) is longer than their lifetime. Wait, no, I might be getting that backwards. Let me think again.

If a particle is moving, its lifetime is longer (as per time dilation). So the time it has to reach the wall is t = R/(gamma v) (since v is approximately c, but let's see). Wait, wait, no. The time in the lab frame is t = R/(v), because v is the speed. But the lifetime of the particle from the lab frame is gamma * tau. So the particle will reach the wall if t < gamma * tau. 

Wait, no. If the particle's lifetime is longer (gamma tau), then the particle can travel further before decaying. So the maximum distance it can travel is v * (gamma tau). 

So the maximum distance D is v * gamma tau. If D is greater than or equal to the detector radius R, the particle will reach the wall. Otherwise, it will decay before that.

So for the particles to reach the wall, we need v gamma tau >= R.

But the problem states that under the current conditions (gamma ~20), only one third of the particles reach the wall. So in that case, perhaps v gamma tau is such that on average, one third of the particles have v gamma tau >= R.

Wait, but wait
