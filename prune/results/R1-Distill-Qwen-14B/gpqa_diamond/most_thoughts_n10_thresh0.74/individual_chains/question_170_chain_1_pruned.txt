Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction for an electron. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The problem says the electron is in the spin state (3i, 4). Wait, in spin notation, that's probably a two-component vector, right? So the state vector χ is [3i, 4]—I guess that means the first component is 3i and the second is 4. So χ = [3i, 4]^T.

The expectation value of S_y is what they're asking for. I remember that the expectation value of an operator is given by the bra-ket notation: ⟨S_y⟩ = ⟨χ| S_y |χ⟩. Alternatively, it's (χ†) S_y χ, where † denotes the conjugate transpose.

Wait, but S_y is the spin operator in the y-direction. Oh right, for spin-½ particles like electrons, the spin operator S is (ħ/2) times the Pauli matrix σ. So S_y = (ħ/2) σ_y.

The σ_y matrix is given as [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So putting that into the equation, S_y = (ħ/2) times that matrix.

So to compute the expectation value, I need to calculate χ† multiplied by σ_y, and then multiply by χ. Then multiply by ħ/2.

Let me write this out. The state χ is [3i, 4], so the conjugate transpose χ† is [ -3, 4 ] because the first component is the conjugate of 3i, which is -3, and the second is the conjugate of 4, which remains 4.

So χ† is a row vector: [ -3, 4 ].

Now, let me compute χ† σ_y χ. Let's break it down:

First, multiply σ_y by χ. Let me compute σ_y * χ.

σ_y is:
0  -i
i   0

Multiplying this by the column vector [3i; 4] gives:

First component: 0 * 3i + (-i) *4 = (-i *4) = -4i.

Second component: i *3i + 0*4 = i*(3i) = 3i². Wait, i squared is -1, so that's 3*(-1) = -3.

So σ_y χ is [ -4i, -3 ]^T.

Wait wait, no—that's the result of σ_y * χ. Now, the next step is to multiply χ† (which is [ -3, 4 ]) with this result.

So χ† (σ_y χ) equals (-3)*(-4i) + (4)*(-3).

Calculating each term:

First term: (-3)*(-4i) = 12i.

Second term: 4*(-3) = -12.

Adding them together: 12i -12.

So the expectation value of σ_y is (12i -12).

Wait, but wait a second. The expectation value of S_y is (ħ/2) times this value.

So ⟨S_y⟩ = (ħ/2) * (12i -12).

Wait, but wait another thing. I must have messed up something here because the expectation value is a real number, right? Because spin components have real expectation values. So getting an imaginary component here suggests I made a mistake.

Hmm, let me double-check the calculations.

First, χ is [3i;4], so χ† is [ -3, 4 ].

Compute σ_y χ:

σ_y is [[0, -i],[i, 0]].

Multiply by [3i,4]^T:

First component: 0 *3i + (-i) *4 = (-i)(4) = -4i.

Second component: i *3i + 0 *4 = i*(3i) = 3i² = 3*(-1) = -3.

Wait, so σ_y χ is [ -4i; -3 ].

Now, multiply χ† (which is [ -3, 4 ]) by this vector.

So (-3)*(-4i) + 4*(-3) = 12i -12.

Hmm, so that's 12i-12. That's correct but it's a complex number. But expectation values for observables should be real, so I must have done something wrong.

Wait wait, maybe I messed up the order. Because in quantum mechanics, the expectation value is ⟨ψ| O |ψ⟩. So here, O is σ_y, and ψ is [3i;4]. So the calculation should be ψ† * σ_y * ψ.

Wait, but I think I did that correctly. So why am I getting a complex number? That suggests an error.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the multiplication. Let me try the matrix multiplication again.

Let me compute σ_y * χ:

First element: (0)(3i) + (-i)(4) = 0 + (-i *4) = -4i.

Second element: (i)(3i) + (0)(4) = 3i^2 + 0 = 3*(-1) = -3.

So the result is [ -4i, -3 ].

Then, χ† is [ -3, 4 ].

So χ† * (σ_y χ) is (-3)*(-4i) + (4)*(-3) = (12i) + (-12) = 12i -12.

Hmm, that's the same result as before. So this suggests that the product is
