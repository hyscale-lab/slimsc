Okay, so I've got this genetics question in front of me, and I need to figure it out. Let's take it step by step. Hmm, let me read the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

Alright, the scenario is about a drought-resistant barley cultivar. It's good because it can handle droughts, but the problem is it has an anti-nutritional compound. That compound makes it impossible to use the barley for food. So they found the gene responsible for this compound, which has five exons and four introns. The plan is to use EMS mutagenesis to create mutants and see which mutation would eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.

The question gives the intact gene sequence and four mutant sequences, each showing changes in the first exon area. We need to figure out which mutation would likely eliminate the compound. The options are Mutant 1, 2, 3, or 4.

So, the key here is probably to find a mutation that disrupts the gene's function. Since the compound is anti-nutritional, the gene probably codes for a protein that produces it. So if the gene is nonfunctional, the compound won't be made, making the barley usable.

Looking at the sequences, the intact gene is in uppercase, and the mutants have lowercase changes. Let me write them out more clearly.

Intact gene:
5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’
Let me note the positions where each mutant differs.

Mutant 1:
5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Comparing to the intact, it looks like the 4th and 5th nucleotides change. The intact has 'TT', while mutant 1 has 'CT'. Then, at a later part, the last part shows 'GC' instead of 'GT' in the intact. Wait, no, let me look more carefully.

Wait, the intact gene starts with ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGAT... Mutant 1 is ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGAT... So the first part: positions 4 and 5. Intact is 'TT', mutant is 'CT'.

Then, further down, looking at the end, the intact has ...GTCGT…, and mutant 1 has ...GTCGC… So position where the last part changes is the last nucleotide before TGA. The intact has a G, mutant has a C.

So the changes are: at position 4-5, TT → CT, and at position near the end, GT → GC.

What about Mutant 2:
5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Comparing to intact, first part is ATGTTCTAAGC... vs ATGTTTCTCGC. So in the first part, it's changed. Let me see:

Intact: after ATG, it's TTTCTC..., and mutant is TTCTAA. So at positions 4-7 perhaps? Because the fourth nucleotide might be the first 'T' in TTT.

Wait, the sequence is 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGAT... So the first change in mutant 2 is maybe at the third T? Let's see: the intact has TTTCTCGC, and mutant 2 has TCTAAGC.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of codons. Because the gene starts with ATG, which is methionine, the start codon.

Looking at the first part:

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT ... 

Mutant 1: ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT ... 

Wait, so the first few codons:

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG ...

Mutant 1: ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG ...

So the first codon is the same ATG. Second codon in intact is TTT (Phe), in mutant 1 it's TTC (also Phe). Oh, wait, TTC is phenylalanine (Phe), same as Phe? Wait, no. Let me remember the codon table. TTT is Phe, TTC is also Phe. So the second codon remains the same, so no amino acid change there. Hmm. Then the third codon in intact is CTC (Leu), and in mutant 1 it's TAC (Tyr). So that's a change from Leu to Tyr.

In the end, the last part of the intact is ...GTCGT..., so the codon before that would be GTC (Val) and GT... Wait, the end is TGA, which is the stop codon. So the last codon is TGA. So in the intact, before that, it's ...GTCGT... So the last codon before TGA is GTC (Val) and then G... Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again.

The intact sequence ends with ...GTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’. So before the TGA stop codon, the codon is GTC (since three letters before TGA are GTC). So the last codon before stop is GTC, which is Val.

In Mutant 1, the end is ...GTCGC…TGA. So the last codon would be GCG (since it's three letters before TGA). Wait, no. Let me parse it: the last part is ...GTCGC…TGA. The last three before TGA are TCG? Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps the last codon is changed from GTC (Val) to GCG? Wait, no. Let me look again.

Wait, in the intact, the last part before TGA is ...GTCGT…, so the last three nucleotides before TGA are TCG? No, the last part is ...GTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA. So before TGA, it's ...GTCGT. So the last codon is GTC (Val?), and then GT is part of the next codon? No, that can't be. Wait, perhaps the sequence is:

...GTCGT... TGA.

So, the last codon is GTC (Val), and then the next is GT... but that leaves an incomplete codon. Wait, maybe I'm looking at it wrong. Let me think of the entire sequence as a series of codons.

Intact:

ATG (start) TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGC TGT ... TGA.

Wait, maybe putting it into triplets:

ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGC TGT ... TGA.

Wait, but the TGA is the stop codon, so the last three are TGA.

Wait, but in the given sequences, the end is ...GTCGT…TGA. So, the last few codons would be:

...GTC GT ... TGA.

Wait, that's two codons: GTC and GT? No, that can't be right. Maybe I'm not looking at it correctly. Alternatively, perhaps the part before TGA is ...GTCGT, which is five nucleotides, so two codons: GTC and GT? No, that doesn't make sense. Perhaps I'm getting this wrong because the exact sequence isn't clear. Maybe I should focus on the parts that are changing and see what kind of mutations they are.

Alternatively, perhaps the focus is on whether the mutation creates a premature stop codon, which would truncate the protein. So if a mutation introduces a stop codon earlier, the protein would be shorter. If that disrupts the enzyme that produces the anti-nutritional compound, that's good. Alternatively, a missense mutation might change the protein's function, but maybe not completely inactivate it.

So looking at each mutant:

Mutant 1: Changes in the first exon, which is coding, so the mRNA will have these changes. Let's look at the DNA changes in the coding region.

The first part of the intact gene is: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT ... 

Mutant 1: ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT ... 

So, the second codon in the intact is TTT (Phe), in mutant 1 it's TTC (Phe). So same amino acid. Then the third codon in intact is CTC (Leu), in mutant 1 it's TAC (Tyr). So that's a change from Leu to Tyr. That's a missense mutation. So the protein would have Tyr instead of Leu at that position. But would that disrupt the function? Maybe, but maybe not completely. So the gene is still producing a protein, perhaps with reduced activity but not completely inactive.

Then, the last part: Intact ends with ...GTCGT...TGA.

Mutant1 ends with ...GTCGC...TGA. So the last codon before TGA in the intact is ...GTC (Val), and in mutant 1, it's ...GCG (Ala), because the last three before TGA are GCG. Wait, no. Let's see: the last part is ...GTCGT, which in the intact is GTC (Val) followed by T (start of next codon), but wait, if it's ...GTCGT..., that would be the last codon before stop as TGT, but I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the change is in the last codon before TGA. Let me think: the last codon is the one before TGA. In intact, the last codon is GTC (Val), then TGA. In mutant 1, the last part is ...GTCGC..., so the last codon is GCG (Ala), followed by TGA. So the last amino acid changes from Val to Ala. So in the protein, the last amino acid is Val in the intact and becomes Ala in mutant 1. So that's a change towards the end of the protein. Maybe it's in a critical region, but perhaps not necessarily.

So mutant 1 has two changes: Leu → Tyr and Val → Ala. Not a frameshift, so the rest of the protein is the same.

Mutant 2:

5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Looking at the first part: ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT ... 

So, the first codon is ATG, same. Second codon: TTT in intact, TTC in mutant 2 (same as before, Phe). Third codon in intact is CTC (Leu), in mutant 2 it's TAA (Stop). Oh wait, that's a problem. In mutant 2, the third codon is TAA, which is a stop codon. So the protein would be truncated after the second amino acid.

Wait, let me check: the first few codons.

Intact: ATG (Met), TTT (Phe), CTC (Leu), GCT (Ala), GGT (Gly), ACT (Thr), etc.

Mutant 2: ATG (Met), TTC (Phe), TAA (Stop), GCT (Ala), GGT (Gly), etc.

So after Met and Phe, the next codon in mutant 2 is TAA, which is a stop. So the protein would be Met-Phe-STOP, which is way shorter. That would likely produce a nonfunctional protein, because it's missing most of its structure. So this might be the desired mutation.

Mutant 3:

5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’
First part: ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG GAT ...

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT ...

So, the second codon is same (Phe). Third codon in intact is CTC (Leu), in mutant 3 it's TAC (Tyr). So change from Leu to Tyr. Then the next codon in intact is GCT (Ala), in mutant 3 it's GCT (Ala) – same. Next, intact has GGT (Gly), mutant3 has GGT (same). Then, intact has ACT (Thr), mutant3 has TCA (Ser). So Thr → Ser. Then, intact has TCT (Ser), mutant3 has TCT (Ser) – same. Then GTG (Val), same. GAT (Asp), same. So in mutant3, there are two changes: Leu→Tyr and Thr→Ser. No frameshift, so the reading frame continues. So the protein is altered at two positions, but not truncated. So the protein is likely still functional, unless those changes disrupt the active site.

Mutant4:

5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’
First part: ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT ...

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT ...

Comparing, third codon in intact is CTC (Leu), in mutant4 it's TAC (Tyr). Fourth codon in intact is GCT (Ala), in mutant4 it's ACT (Thr). So two changes: Leu→Tyr and Ala→Thr. Then the next codon in intact is GGT (Gly), in mutant4 after ACT, the next would be TCT (Ser) instead of GGT (Gly). So that's another change. So mutant4 has three changes: Leu→Tyr, Ala→Thr, and Gly→Ser. Again, no frameshift, so the reading frame is maintained. So the protein would have multiple amino acid changes, but probably still functional unless those changes destroy the enzyme's structure.

Now, the problem is that the anti-nutritional compound is produced because the gene is functional. So we need a mutation that disrupts the gene's function, such as a premature stop codon.

Looking back, mutant2 has a stop codon in the third position (TAA). That would cause the protein to be much shorter, likely nonfunctional. So mutant2 is a candidate.

Wait, but I should also check for any frameshifts. Frameshift mutations would change all downstream amino acids, potentially leading to a nonfunctional protein.

Do any of the mutants have insertions or deletions that cause frameshifts?

Looking at the sequences:

Mutant1: The first part has a change from TT to CT (so a substitution, not a frameshift). The end has GT → GC, another substitution. No frameshift, so the reading frame remains correct.

Mutant2: No insertions or deletions. It's substitutions only. So no frameshift.

Mutant3: All changes are substitutions. No frameshift.

Mutant4: All changes are substitutions. No frameshift.

So the only possibility for a frameshift would be if a mutation had an insertion or deletion of nucleotides not divisible by three. But in all the mutants, the changes are single nucleotide substitutions, so no frameshift.

Therefore, the only way to disrupt the gene's function is by introducing a premature stop codon. Which is what mutant2 does.

So mutant2 would produce a truncated protein, likely nonfunctional. That would prevent the anti-nutritional compound from being made.


To determine which mutation would most likely eliminate the anti-nutritional compound in the drought-resistant barley cultivar, we analyze the mutations in the first exon of the gene. The goal is to identify a mutation that disrupts the gene's function, such as by introducing a premature stop codon or significantly altering the protein's structure.

### Key Analysis of Each Mutant:

1. **Intact Gene**:  
   The sequence provided starts with the start codon `ATG` and ends with the stop codon `TGA`. The coding region includes several codons that define the protein's structure.

2. **Mutant 1**:  
   - Changes:  
     - `TTT` (Phe) → `TTC` (Phe) in the second codon (no change in amino acid).  
     - `CTC` (Leu) → `TAC` (Tyr) in the third codon (missense mutation).  
     - `GTC` (Val) → `GCG` (Ala) near the stop codon (missense mutation).  
   - **Conclusion**: The mutations are missense changes, altering the protein but not completely disrupting its function. The reading frame remains intact.

3. **Mutant 2**:  
   - Changes:  
     - `TTT` (Phe) → `TTC` (Phe) in the second codon (no change in amino acid).  
     - `CTC` (Leu) → `TAA` (Stop) in the third codon (introduces a premature stop codon).  
   - **Conclusion**: The premature stop codon (`TAA`) truncates the protein after the second amino acid, rendering it nonfunctional. This is the most likely mutation to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.

4. **Mutant 3**:  
   - Changes:  
     - `CTC` (Leu) → `TAC` (Tyr) in the third codon (missense mutation).  
     - `ACT` (Thr) → `TCA` (Ser) in the sixth codon (missense mutation).  
   - **Conclusion**: These are missense mutations that alter the protein but do not disrupt its overall structure or function.

5. **Mutant 4**:  
   - Changes:  
     - `CTC` (Leu) → `TAC` (Tyr) in the third codon (missense mutation).  
     - `GCT` (Ala) → `ACT` (Thr) in the fourth codon (missense mutation).  
     - `GGT` (Gly) → `TCT` (Ser) in the fifth codon (missense mutation).  
   - **Conclusion**: These are missense mutations that alter the protein but do not disrupt its overall structure or function.

### Final Decision:
The most effective mutation is **Mutant 2**, as it introduces a premature stop codon (`TAA`), which truncates the protein and likely renders it nonfunctional. This would prevent the synthesis of the anti-nutritional compound.
