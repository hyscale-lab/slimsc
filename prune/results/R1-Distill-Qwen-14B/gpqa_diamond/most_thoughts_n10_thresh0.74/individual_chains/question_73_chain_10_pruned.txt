Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on relativity, but let's try to think this through.

The problem says the astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. The question is asking for their relative speed and the total energy.

First, I remember that in relativity, velocities don't just add up normally. Like, if two objects are moving towards each other, you can't just subtract their speeds from c. I think you need to use the velocity addition formula. Wait, but here both are moving in the same direction, so maybe I should subtract their speeds. Let me recall the formula.

The formula for relative velocity in special relativity is (u - v)/(1 - (uv/c²)). Wait, no, wait. Let me make sure. If object A is moving at u and object B at v, both in the same direction, from A's frame, B is moving at (v - u)/(1 - (uv/c²)), right? Or maybe the other way around. Wait, if u is the velocity of B relative to the lab, and v is A's velocity, then from A's frame, B's velocity is (u - v)/(1 - (uv/c²)). Or is it the other way around? Hmm, maybe I should get that right.

Wait, let's think about the setup. Let me denote astronaut A as the one with mass 2m moving at 0.6c, and astronaut B as 3m moving at 0.5c, both in the same direction. So from the lab frame, A is faster than B. So from A's perspective, what speed is B moving at?

Wait, actually, in this problem, the relative speed is from one astronaut's frame to the other. So if we take astronaut A as the observer (the rest frame), what's the speed of astronaut B? Because both are moving in the same direction, I think the formula would be (v - u)/(1 - (u v)/c²), where u is A's speed relative to the lab, and v is B's speed relative to the lab.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. Suppose in the lab frame, A is moving at u = 0.6c, and B is moving at v = 0.5c, both
