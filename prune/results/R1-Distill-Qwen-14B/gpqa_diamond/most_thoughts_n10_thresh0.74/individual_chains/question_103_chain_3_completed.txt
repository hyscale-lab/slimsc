Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure out the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene. Hmm, okay, let's break this down.

First, I should probably visualize the target molecule. The structure is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So, the ethanone part is a ketone with the carbonyl group attached to the benzene ring. The benzene ring has substituents: a bromo group at the 3 position and a nitro group at the 5 position. Wait, wait—no, wait. The numbering would be based on the substituents' positions. Let me draw this mentally. The phenyl group is attached to the carbonyl carbon (C=O), so the benzene ring is connected to the ketone. On the benzene ring, there are two substituents: a bromine and a nitro group. The positions are 3-bromo and 5-nitro. So, if the phenyl group is attached at position 1, then bromine is at position 3 and nitro at position 5. Because benzene is a ring, positions 1, 3, and 5 are meta to each other, I think. So that's a 3,5-dinitro bromophenyl ketone.

Wait, no, because the substituents are bromo and nitro. So the ketone is the main group, and the benzene has two substituents: Br at position 3 and nitro at position 5 relative to the ketone group.

But wait, benzene is symmetric. So when you have substituents in the meta positions relative to each other, they are 1,3-di... or in this case, if the ketone is at position 1, then bromine is at 3 and nitro at 5. Oh, but wait, the numbering on the benzene would depend on the substituents. Let me think about how the substituents are arranged. 

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are in the 3 and 5 positions relative to each other. So, the benzene ring has the ketone group (from ethan-1-one) attached at position 1. Then, bromine is at position 3 (which is meta to position 1), and the nitro group is at position 5, which is ortho to position 3 and para to position 1? Or wait, no. If the ketone is at position 1, then positions 2 and 6 are ortho, 3 and 5 are meta, and 4 is para. So having Br at 3 and nitro at 5 would place them both meta to the ketone. But wait, that would make them adjacent to each other. Wait, 1 is the ketone, 3 is Br, and 5 is nitro. So from 1, you go clockwise: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. So 3 is next to 2 and 4, and 5 is next to 4 and 6. So 3 and 5 are across from each other, separated by position 4. So that's para to each other. Wait no, position 3 is meta to 1, and position 5 is also meta to 1. So 3 and 5 are two positions apart from each other. So the substituents are in the meta positions relative to the ketone, but they are adjacent on the ring? Wait, no, benzene is a six-membered ring. So positions 1, 3, 5 are all meta to each other. So if the ketone is at 1, the Br is at 3, and nitro is at 5, that would mean the substituents are at 1,3,5 positions. Wait, but the target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So substituents are on the benzene ring in 3 and 5 positions relative to the ketone group. So the benzene ring has the ketone at position 1, Br at 3, nitro at 5. So that's a 1,3,5-trisubstituted benzene? No, wait, the ketone is part of the ethanone, so the benzene is connected to the ketone. So the substituents are on the benzene ring: Br at 3, nitro at 5, and the ketone at 1.

So, the substituents are in the 3 and 5 positions relative to the ketone. Now, to plan the synthesis, I need to find a way to get these substituents onto the benzene ring in the correct positions, along with the ketone.

The starting material is benzene, so I need to introduce these groups in the right order.

In aromatic substitution reactions, the directing effects of substituents matter. Nitration, bromination, acetylation (to form the ketone), etc., all have different directing effects.

I think the key is to figure out the order of introducing substituents so that each new group directs the next substitution to the desired position.

Let me consider the possible steps.

First, one common approach is to introduce the strongest directing group first. Wait, but nitro groups are meta directors, and Br is ortho/para. Hmm.

Wait, the target has a nitro group and a Br. Let me think about the order of adding these substituents.

Wait, the ketone is an acetyl group (from ethan-1-one), which is attached to the benzene. Acetylation is typically done via Friedel-Crafts acylation, which uses AlCl3 as a catalyst, right? But wait, Friedel-Crafts requires the ring to be activated. Benzene is not very reactive, so perhaps I need to activate it first.

Alternatively, I might need to introduce strong activating groups that can be used in the synthesis.

Wait, the ketone group is a meta director. Because the acetyl group is an electron-withdrawing group. So when the acetyl group is attached, any subsequent substitution will occur at the meta position relative to it.

So, the plan is to attach the acetyl group first. Then, introduce nitro and Br in the correct positions.

Wait, but wait: the target is that the benzene ring has the acetyl group, Br at 3, and nitro at 5. So, the acetyl group is at position 1, Br at 3 (meta to acetyl), and nitro at 5 (meta to acetyl as well). Wait, but 3 and 5 are adjacent positions. Hmm, but if the acetyl is at 1, then nitration in the meta would be at 3 and 5 positions? Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

When a meta-directing group is attached to benzene, any new substituents will go into the meta positions relative to it. So, the acetyl group is an electron-withdrawing group and is a meta director.

So, if I first introduce the acetyl group (Friedel-Crafts acylation), then the next substitution will be at meta positions relative to the acetyl.

So, after acylation, the benzene ring has the acetyl group at position 1. If I nitrate it next, the nitro group will go into position 3 or 5 (meta positions). 

Wait, but if I have only one substituent, the nitration will occur at the meta position relative to the acetyl group.

Then, after nitration, the benzene has acetyl at 1 and nitro at 3.

Now, the next step is to introduce Br. But wait, the nitro group is a strong meta director, and the acetyl is already in place. So when introducing Br, I have to consider where it will go.

But hang on, the nitro group is at 3, which is meta to the acetyl at 1. Now, if I perform a bromination, where will it go? So, the existing substituents are acetyl (1) and nitro (3). Now, the acetyl is meta to nitro. So, when adding Br, it will be directed by both groups.

Alternatively, perhaps nitro is a stronger director than acetyl, but I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, perhaps after the nitro is introduced, the positions available for Br would be at the 5 position (relative to acetyl) or ortho to nitro.

Wait, maybe I should think about the directing effects in the order of substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to introduce the nitro group before the acetyl. Let's think about that.

If I nitrate benzene first, nitro is a meta director. So, nitration would add a nitro group at position 1. Then, if I perform another nitration, where would it go? The first nitro is meta director, so the next nitration would be at position 3 or 5. Wait, but the target has only one nitro group.

Wait, perhaps the order is acetylate first, nitrate, then brominate. Let's try that.

1. Acylation: benzene → acetophenone (phenyl ketone). Acetyl is at position 1.

2. Nitration: under HNO3/H2SO4, the meta position (3 or 5) relative to acetyl. Let's say we get nitro at 3.

Now, the ring has acetyl at 1 and nitro at 3. Now, bromination: where does the Br go? The existing groups are acetyl (meta director) and nitro (meta director). So, which positions are available?

In this case, the ring is substituted at 1 (acetyl) and 3 (nitro). The available positions are 2,4,5,6.

Wait, but wait, the substituents are at 1 and 3. So, 5 is adjacent to 3 (so that's ortho to nitro). Acetyl is at 1, so 3 is meta to it. Now, when brominating, the existing groups are acetyl and nitro. Both are meta directors.

The acetyl is at 1, so bromine could go to 3 (already occupied by nitro) or 5. The nitro is at 3, so bromine could go to 6 (meta to nitro), or 5 (ortho to nitro), or 1 (para to nitro). But 1 is occupied by acetyl, so not available. So possible positions for Br are 5 and 6.

Wait, but 5 is meta to acetyl (since 1 is acetyl, 3 is nitro, and 5 would be meta to acetyl as well. So, whether the Br can go to 5.

But let's think about the directing effects. The nitro group is a strong meta-director, so the Br would prefer to go into positions ortho or para to nitro. Oh wait, no. Nitro is a meta director, so incoming substituents go meta to it. Which for nitro at 3, the meta positions would be 6 and 1. But 1 is taken. So, the only available position is 6.

But wait, the target requires Br at 3 and nitro at 5. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps I should first nitrate, then brominate, then acetylate. Wait, that might complicate things because Friedel-Crafts requires an activating group.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the correct order is to introduce the Br last, as a halogenation, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, another approach is to perform a substitution where the substituents are introduced in such a way that each directs the next group into the correct position.

Let me think about the possible steps in each option and see which makes sense.

Looking at the options:

Option A: i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 (Friedel-Crafts acylation), then Br2/FeBr3, then HNO3/H2SO4, then Fe/HCl (which is a reduction, maybe?), then another HNO3, then NaNO2/HCl (maybe diazotization), then H3PO2.

Hmm, but I'm not sure about that sequence. Let me think about each step.

Option A:

i) Acylation: benzene → acetophenone.

ii) Br2/FeBr3: bromination. Since the ring is activated at the acetyl position, bromine would add meta to it. So Br would go at position 3.

Now, the ring has acetyl at 1 and Br at 3.

iii) HNO3/H2SO4: nitration. The ring has two groups: acetyl (meta director) and Br (ortho/para director). So where does nitration occur?

The meta director (acetyl) would direct meta to itself, which is position 5. But let's see: acetyl is at 1, so meta would be 3 and 5. Position 3 is already taken by Br, so nitration would occur at 5.

So after step iii, nitro is at 5.

Now, the substituents are acetyl at 1, Br at 3, nitro at 5.

Wait, that's exactly the target structure! So the molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So that's the desired product. But wait, but in the option A, after step iii, there's more steps.

Wait, but step iv is Fe/HCl. What's that? Fe/HCl is a reducing agent. Maybe it's used for something else, but in this case, why would we need that?

Wait, the current product after step iii is the desired one. So if the steps are as in option A, but the product is achieved after step iii, why are there more steps?

Option A goes on: iv) Fe/HCl (maybe reduction?), then v) HNO3/H2SO4 again, then vi) NaNO2/HCl, then vii) H3PO2.

So that's a lot of steps beyond the target. So maybe option A isn't the correct sequence.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe when you introduce substituents, you have to consider the order of nitration and bromination. Let me see.

Option B:

i) Br2/FeBr3: bromination of benzene → bromobenzene.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4: nitration. Since Br is an ortho/para director, the nitro would go into one of those positions. Let's say it goes para to Br. So nitro at position 4.

iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3: acylation. Now, the ring has Br and nitro. The acetyl group is a meta director. Wait, but the ring has Br at position 1 and nitro at 4.

When we acetylate, where would the acetyl go? The ring has Br (ortho/para director) and nitro (meta). The acetyl group is an electrophilic substitution. So the activating groups (Br) would direct the incoming acetyl group to ortho or para positions.

Wait, but Br is ortho/para director, and nitro is meta. So the available positions are 2,3,5,6.

Wait, with Br at 1 and nitro at 4, the possible positions for acetyl are 2,3,5,6. But acetylation is a Friedel-Crafts, which requires activating groups. Wait, Br is an activating group (ortho/para), but nitro is deactivating. So the ring is a mix of activating and deactivating groups.

Hmm, Friedel-Crafts acylation requires an activated aromatic ring. With Br present, which is activating but deactivating? Wait, wait, benzene rings with activating groups (like Br, which is an activating group because it's an electron-donating group via resonance) are needed for Friedel-Crafts. But nitro is deactivating (electron-withdrawing), so it would deactivate the ring. So, in the presence of a deactivating group, Friedel-Crafts may not proceed easily.

So, in option B, after bromination and nitration, the ring has Br and nitro. Friedel-Crafts acylation may not proceed because nitro is deactivating. So step iii in option B might not work. So option B is unlikely.

Option C:

i) HNO3/H2SO4: nitrate benzene → nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl: reduce nitrobenzene to benzylamine? Wait, Fe/HCl is a reagent for reduction. Nitrobenzene can be reduced to aniline with H2/Pd, but Fe/HCl is used in the Bechamp reaction, which reduces nitro groups to amines as well. So, after step ii, the ring has an amine group.

iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3: acylation. But the ring now has an amine group, which is a strong activating group (ortho/para). So the acetyl group would be added ortho or para to the amine.

Wait, but if the amine is at position 1, then acetyl would go to 2,4,6. Let's say it goes to position 4. So, acetyl at 4.

Now, the ring has amine at 1 and acetyl at 4.

iv) Br2/FeBr3: bromination. Now, the ring has amine (strong activating, ortho/para) and acetyl (meta). Where would Br go?

The amine is ortho/para director. So possible positions are 2,4,6. But position 4 has acetyl, so Br would go to 2 or 6.

But after that, further nitrations or steps may complicate things. Plus, the target requires nitro groups, which are introduced via nitration. So perhaps this is not the correct path.

Option D:

i) HNO3/H2SO4: nitrate benzene → nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl: reduce nitro to amine → aniline.

iii) NaNO2/HCl: diazotization. Making a diazonium chloride.

iv) H3PO2: which is a reducing agent, perhaps for a Sandmeyer reaction. But I'm not sure how this fits.

v) Br2/FeBr3: bromination.

vi) CH3COCl/AlCl3: acylation.

vii) HNO3/H2SO4: nitration.

Hmm, this seems a bit convoluted. Let me see.

Step i: Nitro group added.

Step ii: Reduce nitro to amine.

Step iii: Diazotization.

Step iv: H3PO2—wait, that's a reagent used in the Stannous chloride reduction, perhaps for converting diazonium salts to bromide or chloride. Or, wait, H3PO2 is used in the Wolff-Kishner reaction for ketones, but that's for reducing carbonyl groups. Or maybe it's used for desilylation or something else. Alternatively, in the context of diazonium salts, maybe it's a different application. I'm not too sure.

Alternatively, perhaps steps iii and iv are for a substitution reaction. For example, using diazonium salt and a copper salt for a coupling reaction or for introducing Br. But I'm not entirely certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps are meant to make a bromine substitution. For example, after making the diazonium salt, treating with H3PO2 might lead to substitution with another group, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about each option again.

Looking back, in option A, the steps are:

i) Acylate → acetophenone.

ii) Br → bromide at meta to acetyl (position 3).

iii) Nitrate → nitro at meta to acetyl, which is position 5, since position 3 is taken.

So after step iii, the target is achieved. But option A has more steps after that, so perhaps it's not the correct sequence.

Wait, so why would option A have more steps? That would lead to more substituents than needed. So perhaps option A isn't correct.

Looking again, perhaps the correct order is acylation, nitration, then bromination, but that might not work because nitro is meta.

Wait, let me think again. Let's outline the desired substituents on the benzene ring:

1. Acetylation (position 1) → creates a meta-director.

2. Nitration (position 3) → meta to acetyl.

3. Bromination must be at position 5, but wait, after nitration, the ring has acetyl (1) and nitro (3). Now, introducing Br, a meta director for nitro would be position 6. But how can we get Br to 5?

Wait, perhaps I should think about the order of substituents. Alternatively, maybe I need to nitrate before acetylation.

If I nitrate first, then acetylate, but that might not be feasible because the ring would have a nitro group (deactivating) which would make Friedel-Crafts acylation difficult.

Wait, but if I nitrate benzene first, making nitrobenzene. Then, acetylation would require a deactivating group, which would make the ring less reactive. So Friedel-Crafts may not proceed. So that's a problem.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use a different approach by using a directing group that allows both substituents to be added in the correct positions.

Wait, maybe I can introduce groups in such a way that each directs the next substitution into the desired position.

Let me think about another approach.

Suppose I first nitrate benzene to get nitro group at position 1.

Then, brominate under certain conditions to get Br at position 3 (meta to nitro).

But wait, nitro is a meta director, so bromine would go meta to nitro, that is, position 4 (if nitro is at 1, then bromine would go to 4? No, wait, in benzene with a substituent at 1, the meta positions are 3 and 5.

Wait, let me imagine nitro at position 1. Then, the meta positions are 3 and 5. So when brominating, Br would go to either 3 or 5.

If I then acetylate, the acetyl group would go into a position directed by the existing substituents (nitro and Br). But acetyl is a meta director, but if the ring is already substituted with nitro and Br, which are meta directors, then where would the acetyl go?

Hmm, perhaps it's getting too complicated. Let me try a different approach. Looking at the options, perhaps option C is the correct one.

Option C:

i) Nitrate benzene → nitrobenzene.

ii) Reduce with Fe/HCl → aniline.

iii) Acylate with CH3COCl/AlCl3 → acetylaniline.

iv) Brominate → Br substitution.

v) Nitrate again.

vi) Diazotization.

vii) H3PO2.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think step by step.

After step i: nitro at 1.

Step ii: reduce to amine at 1.

Step iii: acylation at position 3 (since amine is ortho/para director, so acetyl can go to position 2,4, or 6, but perhaps it's best when acylation occurs at position 4, which is para to the amine.

So now, ring has amine at 1 and acetyl at 4.

Step iv: bromination. Amine is ortho/para director (but it's a strong activating group), acetyl is meta. So where would Br go? It would go ortho or para to the amine.

Positions available: 2,3,5,6. Let's say Br goes to position 2 (ortho to amine at 1).

Now, step v: nitrate again. The ring has amine (strong activating, ortho/para), acetyl (meta), and Br (ortho/para to amine). Nitration is directed by the most activating group, which is the amine.

So nitration would occur ortho or para to amine.

But amine is at 1. Para position is 4, which is already occupied by acetyl. So nitration would go to position 2 (ortho to amine) or position 6 (para to amine? No, position 4 is already taken, so perhaps position 3 or 5? I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, the substituents after step iv are amine at 1, acetyl at 4, Br at 2.

Nitration would be directed by the amine (ortho/para). So possible positions: 2 (taken by Br), 3, 4 (acetyl), 6. So nitration could go to 3 or 6.

If it goes to 3, then the nitro is at 3. Then, after that, step vi is NaNO2/HCl, which is diazotization, and then H3PO2. Not sure what that does here.

Alternatively, this seems messy. Maybe this path isn't correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to first acetylate, then nitrate, then brominate. But in option A, that's what's happening, but the problem is that option A has more steps after the target is achieved.

But perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think: after steps i, ii, iii in option A, we have the desired product. Why are there more steps in option A?

Wait, the target is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So after steps i (acetyl), ii (Br at 3), iii (nitro at 5), that's it. So the product is made. So why does option A have more steps? Because in option A, step iv is Fe/HCl. That would reduce something. Maybe the acetyl is being reduced?

Wait, the product after step iii is acetophenone with Br at 3 and nitro at 5. So, if step iv is Fe/HCl, perhaps it's a reduction. But in what context? Maybe reduction of nitro to amine? But that would change the substituent. Alternatively, if the acetyl is being reduced, but that would turn it into CH2OH or something else, which isn't desired.

So perhaps option A's steps beyond iii are incorrect, meaning that option A isn't the right sequence.

Wait, maybe the correct order is to acylate, nitrate, then brominate, but in such a way that after acylation, nitration occurs, then bromination occurs in the correct position.

Wait, but after acylation and nitration, adding Br might end up in the wrong position.

Alternatively, perhaps after acylation and nitration, the bromine can be added in a specific position.

Alternatively, perhaps the sequence should be: acylation → nitration → bromination, but the bromination requires a specific directing.

Wait, maybe I should think about how the substituents direct each other.

Another idea: substituents are added in a way that each directs the next. For example, first acetylate, then nitrate (directed meta to acetyl), then brominate (directed by nitro and acetyl).

Wait, but after acylation and nitration, the ring has acetyl at 1 and nitro at 3. Now, bromination would be directed by both. Acetyl is at 1 (meta director), nitro at 3 (meta director). So where can Br go? It could go to 5 or 6.

If Br goes to 5, that's meta to acetyl (position 1) and ortho to nitro (position 3). So, perhaps that's possible.

Wait, but the target has Br at 3. Hmm, that complicates things.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the order of adding Br and nitro. If I first acetylate, then brominate, then nitrate.

So:

1. Acetyl at 1.

2. Br at 3 (meta to acetyl).

3. Nitration: where would it go? The ring has acetyl (1) and Br (3). Br is ortho/para director. So nitration would occur ortho or para to Br, which are positions 2,4,6.

But acetyl is at 1, so position 4 is meta to acetyl, which is a possible position. So nitration would occur at position 5 (meta to acetyl) or position 4 (para to Br).

Wait, but Br is at 3. So para to Br is position 7, which doesn't exist. So the para would be position... Wait, no, benzene is a six-membered ring, so para to 3 is position 5. Wait, no: positions 1,2,3,4,5,6. So position 3's para is position 7, which wraps around to position 1. No, wait, no. In benzene, the para position to 1 is 4. So, for position 3, the para is 6. Because position 3 + 3 positions is 6. So, bromination at 3 would have ortho at 2 and 4, and para at 6.

So, after acylation and bromination, the ring has acetyl at 1 and Br at 3. Now, nitration would be directed by Br (ortho/para) and acetyl (meta).

So possible positions are 2,4,6 (from Br), and 5 (meta to acetyl). So which one is more favored?

The acetyl is a meta director, so nitration would prefer to go to 5. But Br is an ortho/para director, so would nitration go to 6 instead?

Alternatively, the acetyl is a stronger director because it's a meta group, and nitration is a strongly directed reaction.

So, in this case, nitration would occur at position 5, leading to the target structure.

So the sequence would be:

i) Acetylate → position 1.

ii) Brominate → position 3.

iii) Nitrate → position 5.

So the steps would be acylation, bromination, nitration.

Looking at the options, which option starts with acylation, then bromination, then nitration?

Looking at the options:

Option A: acylation → bromination → nitration → ... more steps.

So, after step iii in option A, the product is correct. But the further steps may interfere.

So, perhaps the correct option is option A, but only up to step iii. But the option includes more steps, which might complicate things.

Wait, but the question is which sequence of reactions would lead to the desired product. So even if the option has more steps beyond the target, but the target is achieved somewhere in the steps, that's the correct option.

But wait, the target is to get 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So in option A, after step iii, the product is correct. So perhaps the other steps in option A are unnecessary or perhaps I'm misunderstanding them.

Wait, option A's steps after iii are:

iv) Fe/HCl

v) HNO3/H2SO4

vi) NaNO2/HCl

vii) H3PO2

So, perhaps these steps are for something else. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me reevaluate.

In option A, the steps are:

i) Acetylate → acetophenone.

ii) Brominate → Br at 3.

iii) Nitrate → nitro at 5.

So after step iii, the product is correct. But why would option A have more steps? Maybe those steps are for removing something or adding more groups, but the target only requires those three substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is option A, but the unnecessary steps are part of the options. But the question asks for the sequence that leads to the desired product, so perhaps the steps beyond iii don't affect the product or are part of a different process.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe I'm missing something about the directing effects.

Another approach: the nitro group is a strong deactivating, meta-directing group. Once nitro is present, any further substituents would be directed meta to nitro.

Wait, but in option A, the nitro is added after bromination. So, after acylation and bromination, the ring has acetyl (1) and Br (3). Now, when nitrating, the acetyl is a meta director, so nitration would go to 5, which is meta to acetyl. Also, Br is an ortho/para director, but 5 is not ortho or para to Br (Br is at 3; ortho is 2 and 4; para is 6). So 5 is meta to Br as well.

So, the nitration in option A's step iii would correctly add nitro at 5.

So, after step iii, the product is correct.

But then what's the purpose of steps iv to vii in option A? Let's see.

iv) Fe/HCl: Could be a reduction. Maybe for removing a nitro group? But in the target, we need nitro. Alternatively, maybe it's for converting a nitro to an amine. But I'm not sure.

v) HNO3/H2SO4: Nitration again. But the ring already has acetyl and nitro and Br. Adding another nitro would lead to a different product.

vi) NaNO2/HCl: Diazotization, which is usually for making diazonium salts, often to replace a group with another (like in a Sandmeyer reaction). But in the target, we don't have an amine anymore.

vii) H3PO2: Not sure. It's a reducing agent, perhaps used in the Wolff-Kishner reaction to remove carbonyl groups, but that would destroy the ketone, which is part of the target. So I'm not certain.

This suggests that option A's steps beyond iii would alter the product, which is not desired. So perhaps option A is not the correct sequence.

Looking again, perhaps the correct sequence is to acylate, nitrate, then brominate.

Wait, but if I first acylate, then nitrate, then brominate.

So:

i) Acetylate → acetophenone.

ii) Nitrate → nitro at 3.

iii) Brominate → Br at 5.

But wait, after acylation and nitration, the ring has acetyl (1) and nitro (3). Now, brominating would be directed by nitro (meta) and acetyl (meta). So Br would go to 5 or 6.

Wait, but 5 is meta to acetyl (position 1) and meta to nitro (position 3). So, if Br is added at 5, that would give the correct structure.

So the sequence would be: acylation, nitration, bromination.

Looking at the options, which option starts with acylation, then nitration, then bromination?

Looking at the options:

Option A: acylation → bromination → nitration.

Option C: nitration → reduction → acylation → bromination.

Hmm, not seeing an option that does acylation, nitration, bromination.

Wait, perhaps none of the options do that. Alternatively, maybe I'm missing something.

Looking at option B:

i) Br2/FeBr3 → bromobenzene.

ii) HNO3 → nitro group.

iii) CH3COCl → acylation.

But as I thought earlier, Friedel-Crafts would be difficult after nitration because nitro is deactivating.

So, perhaps option B isn't correct.

Option D:

i) HNO3 → nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → aniline.

iii) NaNO2/HCl → diazonium.

iv) H3PO2 → ?

v) Br2 → bromination.

vi) CH3COCl → acylation.

vii) HNO3 → nitration.

Hmm, this seems complicated, but perhaps step iv is a reduction. Maybe H3PO2 is used to reduce a diazonium salt to a bromide. So, after step iv, we have a bromide.

Wait, let me think:

i) Nitro at 1.

ii) Reduced to amine at 1.

iii) Diazotized to form diazonium chloride.

iv) H3PO2 is used in a reaction, perhaps for a substitution. For example, the diazonium salt can be treated with H3PO2 to substitute the amine with a bromide. So after step iv, we have Br at position 1.

v) Brominate again. Wait, but if we have Br already, brominating again would add another Br, which is not part of the target.

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting stuck here. Maybe option D is not the correct one.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the steps in option A again. Even though it has more steps, perhaps the steps are for protecting groups or other purposes.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C.

Wait, option C's steps:

i) Nitrate → nitro at 1.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduce to amine at 1.

iii) Acylate → acetyl at 4 (para to amine).

iv) Br2 → brominate.

v) Nitrate again → nitro at 3.

vi) Diazotize.

vii) H3PO2.

Wait, after step v, the ring has amine at 1, acetyl at 4, Br at 2, nitro at 3.

But the target requires nitro at 5. So this doesn't seem correct.

Hmm.

Another approach: perhaps the correct order is nitrate, then acetylate, then brominate. But as discussed, Friedel-Crafts after nitration is difficult.

Wait, perhaps the acetylation is done via a different method. For instance, using a directing group that allows acetylation after nitration.

Alternatively, perhaps using a directing group that can be introduced after nitration.

Wait, perhaps the acetylation is done via a meta director. Let me think.

If I first nitrate, getting nitro at 1.

Then, brominate, getting Br at 3 (meta to nitro).

Then, acetylate. Now, the ring has nitro (1) and Br (3). Acetylation would be directed by Br (ortho/para) and nitro (meta). So possible positions: 2,4,5,6.

But acetylation requires an activating group. Nitro is deactivating, which would deactivate the ring. So Friedel-Crafts might not proceed.

Hmm, maybe this isn't the way.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct order is bromination, then acetylation, then nitration.

Wait, for that:

i) Bromobenzene.

ii) Acetylate → acetyl at 3 (meta to Br).

iii) Nitrate → nitro at 5 (meta to acetyl), which is also meta to Br.

But when bromination is done first, then acetylation, acetyl is at 3, then nitration at 5.

So the product would have Br at 1, acetyl at 3, nitro at 5. Which is the desired structure.

Wait, that's exactly the target. So the sequence would be bromination → acetylation → nitration.

Which option follows that order?

Looking at the options:

Option B: i) Br → ii) nitrate → iii) acylate.

Wait, no. Option B i) brominate, ii) nitrate, iii) acylate. Which is what I just described.

But wait, Friedel-Crafts acylation requires an activating group. In option B, after bromination and nitration, the ring has Br (activating) and nitro (deactivating). So the ring is a mix, but the presence of Br (activating) may allow acetylation.

But nitro is a strong deactivating group, which makes the ring less reactive towards electrophilic substitution. So even with Br present, the acetylation might not proceed efficiently.

Moreover, the acetyl group would be directed by the existing substituents. So, after bromination (position 1) and nitration (position 3 or 4 or 5?), where would the acetyl go?

Wait, in option B:

i) Br → bromobenzene.

ii) Nitrate → nitro group.

Where would the nitro go in bromobenzene? Br is an ortho/para director. So nitro would go to ortho (position 2) or para (position 4) to Br.

Let's say it goes to position 4 (para to Br at 1).

So now the ring has Br at 1 and nitro at 4.

iii) Acylate → acetyl group.

The ring has Br (ortho/para) and nitro (meta). Where would the acetyl go? The activating group (Br) directs to ortho and para. So possible positions: 2, 3, 5, 6.

But the ring has Br at 1 and nitro at 4. So, acetyl could go to 2 (ortho to Br), 3 (meta to Br), 5 (meta to Br), or 6 (para to Br).

But nitro at 4 is a meta director, which would direct substitution to 1 (taken by Br), 6, or 2.

So the acetyl would likely go to position 2 (ortho to Br) or position 6 (para to Br). But position 6 is meta to nitro (position 4). Hmm.

Wait, in this scenario, after steps i and ii, the ring has Br at 1 and nitro at 4. Then, in step iii, acetylation occurs.

The acetyl group would prefer to go to the positions activated by Br (ortho and para), which are 2, 4, and 6. But 4 is taken by nitro, so possible positions are 2 and 6.

If it goes to 2, then the ring has Br at 1, nitro at 4, acetyl at 2.

But the target requires acetyl at 1, which isn't possible because Br is already at 1. So this doesn't fit.

Alternatively, if acetyl goes to 6, then the ring has Br at 1, nitro at 4, acetyl at 6.

But the target requires acetyl at 1, which isn't the case here.

So, this approach leads to the wrong product.

Therefore, the correct sequence isn't in option B.

Hmm, perhaps I'm stuck. Let me recap.

The target is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.

The substituents are:

- Acetyl (ethanone) at position 1.

- Br at position 3.

- Nitro at position 5.

So, to get this, the order of substituents must be acylation first, then nitration, then bromination. Because after acylation, the ring has acetyl (meta director). Nitration would occur at position 3 or 5, then bromination at the remaining position.

But looking at the options, I don't see an option that starts with acylation, then nitration, then bromination.

Wait, wait, looking again at the options, option A: acylation → bromination → nitration.

Which leads to acetyl at 1, Br at 3, nitro at 5. Which is the target.

So, the correct sequence is in option A. The other steps in option A after step iii are probably not relevant or perhaps are distractors.

But why would option A have more steps? Let me think about the other steps.

After step iii, the desired product is made. Steps iv to vii: Fe/HCl, HNO3 again, NaNO2, H3PO2. Those would add more substituents, which are not desired in the target. So perhaps the correct sequence is up to step iii, but the option includes more steps which are not part of the correct path.

But the question is which sequence would lead to the high-yield synthesis. So the steps in option A would produce the target at step iii, but the subsequent steps would change it. So that can't be correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing a key point about the sequence.

Wait, maybe the bromination in step ii of option A is not in the meta position but in the para. Let me think.

If acetyl is at 1, bromination with FeBr3 would add Br at position 3 (meta) or position 5 (meta) relative to acetyl. Wait, in benzene, meta to position 1 would be positions 3 and 5. So Br would be at 3 or 5.

Wait, but the target requires Br at 3 and nitro at 5. So during step ii of option A, Br would be added at 3. Then, step iii is nitration, which would add nitro at 5.

So, after step iii, the target is achieved. So why would the other steps be present? Perhaps the other steps are part of a different synthesis pathway, but the target is achieved in the first three steps.

But the question is about the correct sequence of reactions. So perhaps the correct option is A because the first three steps correctly produce the target. Even though the option includes more steps, the correct part is the first three.

Wait, but the question says 'which sequence would lead to the high-yield synthesis.' So perhaps option A is the correct one because the first three steps yield the target, and the extra steps don't affect it. Or perhaps the extra steps are there for another purpose, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm wrong in thinking that the acylation is the first step. Perhaps the correct order is to nitrate first, then acetylate, then brominate.

Wait, but as discussed earlier, Friedel-Crafts after nitration is difficult because nitro is deactivating.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is nitration → bromination → acylation.

But let me see:

i) Nitration → nitro at 1.

ii) Bromination → Br at 3 (meta to nitro).

iii) Acylation → acetyl at 5 (meta to nitro, but 5 is already taken by Br? No, Br is at 3. So acetyl would go to 5.

So the ring would have nitro at 1, Br at 3, acetyl at 5. Which is the target.

So the sequence would be nitration → bromination → acylation.

Looking at the options, which option has this order?

Looking at the options:

Option C: i) nitrate → ii) reduce → iii) acylate → iv) brominate.

No, that's nitration, reduction, acylation, bromination.

Not the order I'm thinking of.

Option B: i) brominate → ii) nitrate → iii) acylate. Which is bromination first, then nitrate, then acylate. But as discussed earlier, this leads to incorrect positions.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is none of the above, but the options are limited, so I have to choose from the given options.

Alternatively, perhaps I need to find the option where steps are acylation, nitration, bromination, but none of the options have that.

Wait, looking again:

Option A: acylation, bromination, nitration.

So, after acylation, bromination, then nitration.

So, after acylation, which is position 1.

Bromination adds Br at position 3.

Nitration adds nitro at position 5.

So, the product is correct.

Thus, the correct option is A, even though the option includes more steps, perhaps those after step iii are not necessary, but the product is achieved at step iii.

Wait, but the question is about the correct sequence. So perhaps the correct answer is option A, because it's the only option that correctly places the substituents in the correct positions.

So, after considering all possibilities, I think the correct answer is option A.


To synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene, the correct sequence of reactions must introduce the substituents in the proper order to achieve the desired structure. The target molecule has an acetyl group (ethanone) at position 1, a bromine atom at position 3, and a nitro group at position 5 on the benzene ring. The directing effects of the substituents must be carefully considered to ensure the correct positions for each group.

### Key Analysis of Each Option:

#### **Option A**:
1. **Step i**: Friedel-Crafts acylation introduces the acetyl group at position 1 on benzene. The acetyl group is a meta-director.
2. **Step ii**: Bromination with Br₂/FeBr₃ adds bromine at position 3, which is meta to the acetyl group.
3. **Step iii**: Nitration with HNO₃/H₂SO₄ introduces the nitro group at position 5, which is meta to the acetyl group and does not interfere with the bromine at position 3.
   - After these steps, the target molecule is formed: 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.
4. **Steps iv–vii**: These steps are unnecessary for the synthesis of the target molecule and may alter the product or introduce additional substituents.

This option correctly produces the target molecule after the first three steps.

#### **Option B**:
1. **Step i**: Bromination with Br₂/FeBr₃ introduces bromine at position 1 on benzene. Bromine is an ortho/para-director.
2. **Step ii**: Nitration with HNO₃/H₂SO₄ adds the nitro group at position 4 (para to bromine).
3. **Step iii**: Friedel-Crafts acylation introduces the acetyl group. However, the presence of the nitro group (a strong deactivator) makes the ring less reactive toward Friedel-Crafts acylation, and the acetyl group may not attach at the desired position.
   - This sequence does not lead to the correct structure.

#### **Option C**:
1. **Step i**: Nitration with HNO₃/H₂SO₄ introduces the nitro group at position 1 on benzene. The nitro group is a meta-director.
2. **Step ii**: Reduction with Fe/HCl converts the nitro group to an amine group at position 1.
3. **Step iii**: Friedel-Crafts acylation introduces the acetyl group. The amine group is a strong ortho/para-director, so the acetyl group would likely attach at position 2 or 6, not position 1.
   - This sequence does not produce the desired product.

#### **Option D**:
1. **Step i**: Nitration with HNO₃/H₂SO₄ introduces the nitro group at position 1 on benzene.
2. **Step ii**: Reduction with Fe/HCl converts the nitro group to an amine group at position 1.
3. **Step iii**: Diazotization with NaNO₂/HCl forms a diazonium salt.
4. **Step iv**: H₃PO₂ may reduce the diazonium salt, but the sequence does not clearly lead to the desired product.
5. **Steps v–vii**: Bromination and further nitration would introduce additional substituents, complicating the structure.
   - This sequence does not produce the desired product.

### Conclusion:
Option A is the only sequence that correctly introduces the substituents in the proper order to form the target molecule. After steps i, ii, and iii, the desired product, 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one, is achieved. The additional steps in Option A are unnecessary for the synthesis of the target molecule.
