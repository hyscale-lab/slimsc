Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem in front of me. The question is about determining the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize a specific compound starting from benzene. The target compound is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Hmm, let's break this down.

I remember that when dealing with benzene derivatives, the synthesis typically involves electrophilic substitution reactions. The substituents can direct the incoming groups into certain positions based on their activating or deactivating nature. Let me think about the substituents in the target molecule.

So, the target is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Let me sketch the benzene ring with substituents. Position 1 would be the ethoxy group (-OEt), position 2 the tert-butyl group, and position 3 the nitro group (-NO2). Wait, benzene is a ring, so numbering might be a bit tricky, but for the sake of the analysis, let's imagine positions 1, 2, 3 as adjacent in the ring.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are in the ortho, meta, para positions relative to each other. Let me think about their directing effects. The ethoxy group is an activating, ortho/para director. The tert-butyl group is an activating, also ortho/para director because it's an alkyl group. The nitro group is deactivating and meta-directing.

But wait, the order of adding substituents matters because each new group affects where the next substituent goes. So, the key is to plan the order of adding these groups so that each subsequent reaction correctly places the next substituent.

Let me outline the substituents needed:

1. tert-butyl group
2. ethoxy group (-OEt)
3. nitro group (-NO2)

But wait, the target has three substituents. So the benzene ring has three substituents. The positions are 1, 2, and 3. Let's number the benzene such that the substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3. So, it's a meta arrangement relative to each other? Or perhaps adjacent.

Wait, no. Benzene is a six-membered ring, so substituents at
