Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The question is about a light beam moving through glass that's itself moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the lab. We need to find the speed of light in the glass as seen by the observer. The options are given, and the speed of light in a vacuum is c=1.

Hmm, right. I remember that the speed of light in a medium is c divided by the refractive index n. So normally, in the rest frame of the glass, the speed would be v_light = c/n = 1/n, since c=1 here.

But wait, the glass is moving at velocity v. So this is a problem involving relative motion and possibly special relativity. Oh wait, but wait, the glass is moving at a constant velocity, so maybe it's non-relativistic. Or does it matter? Because when velocities are significant compared to the speed of light, relativistic effects come into play. But the problem doesn't specify that v is small, so I should think about how velocities add according to relativity.

Wait, but in this case, the light is moving in the same direction as the glass. So the observer in the lab would see the light's speed as... Hmm, the glass is moving towards the observer, but the light is moving in the same direction as the glass. Wait, no, the glass is moving toward the observer, so the beam is moving towards the observer as well? Or is the glass moving in the same direction as the beam? Let me check the question again.

The glass is moving in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer. Wait, that seems contradictory. Oh, no, perhaps the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam is propagating. So the beam is going in the same direction as the glass's movement, but the glass is moving towards the observer. So the observer is in the lab, and the glass is moving towards them, but the light is moving in the same direction as the glass. Hmm, I might need to visualize this.

Alternatively, perhaps the setup is that the glass is moving in the same direction as the light beam, and the observer is in the lab, so the glass is moving towards the observer. Wait, that can't be. If the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is in the same direction as the glass's movement, then the light would be moving towards the observer as well. Maybe the setup is that the glass is moving towards the observer, but the light
