Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out what the compound X is based on the reaction and the NMR data provided. Let me try to break this down step by step.

The question says that compound X is C11H12O. It reacts with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. The product's NMR data is given, both 1H and 13C. The options are four different oxirane derivatives, which makes me think that this reaction might be some kind of ring-opening or maybe an epoxidation?

Wait, no. Diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane—I remember that's a crown ether, right? Or wait, more accurately, it's 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane, which is actually a catalyst used in epoxide ring-opening reactions, especially in the presence of certain conditions. Oh, right, it's used in the acid-catalyzed opening of epoxides, maybe? Or wait, no—the reaction conditions here are high temperature (403 K) and a nonpolar solvent. Hmm.

Wait, but the product's NMR suggests that it's a different compound. The starting material is compound X, which is C11H12O. Let me think about the options. All the options are oxirane derivatives, so they have an epoxide group. So if X is reacting with this diazabicyclo compound, maybe the reaction is a ring-opening of the epoxide? Or perhaps it's an oxidation or something else.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me look at the possible reaction. Diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a cyclic amine, specifically a crown ether. Oh wait, no, crown ethers are like 1,3-diaza... something. Maybe it's a base here. Or maybe it's acting as a catalyst for a different kind of reaction.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is an epoxide formation. Wait, but X has an epoxide group (oxirane) as per the options, so that might not fit. Let me think: If X is an epoxide, and it's reacting with this amine—could it be an acid-cataly
