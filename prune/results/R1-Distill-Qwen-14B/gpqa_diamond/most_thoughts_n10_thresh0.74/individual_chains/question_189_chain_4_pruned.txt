Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about particles and symmetry breaking. Hmm, I remember that spontaneous symmetry breaking is a concept where the underlying laws have a certain symmetry, but the system as a whole doesn't exhibit that symmetry because it's in a particular state.

The question asks which effective particle is not associated with spontaneously broken symmetry. The options are A) Phonon, B) Skyrmion, C) Magnon, D) Pion.

Let me think about each particle. 

Phonon: I think phonons are related to vibrations in a crystal lattice. They are quantized sound waves, right? I remember that in solid-state physics, symmetry breaking can lead to phonons as the quasiparticles representing the broken translational symmetry. Because when a crystal forms, the translational symmetry of the liquid is broken, so phonons emerge as the associated quasiparticles.

Skyrmion: Skyrmions are a bit trickier. I remember they are topological solitons, originally proposed in the context of nuclear physics by Skyrme. They are associated with pion fields and are a solution to the symmetry breaking in the nucleon problem. So Skyrmions definitely come from broken symmetry.

Magnon: Magnons are related to spin waves in magnetic materials. When a magnetic material undergoes a phase transition, the spins order in a certain way, which breaks the rotational symmetry. Magnons arise as the Goldstone bosons for that broken symmetry. So they are tied to symmetry breaking.

Pion: Pions are the Goldstone bosons of chiral symmetry breaking in quantum chromodynamics (QCD). Chiral symmetry is broken spontaneously in the vacuum of QCD, and the pions are the lightest particles resulting from that. So pions are directly tied to spontaneous symmetry breaking.

So the question is which one is not associated. All of A, B, C, D except one are from broken symmetry. Wait wait. Let me double-check:

Phonon: Broken translational symmetry in solids. Yes.

Skyrmion: Broken chiral symmetry perhaps? Or maybe from other types of symmetry. I think Skyrmions are related to symmetry breaking in the context of the Lagrangian, like in the Skyrme model where pion fields are involved, which themselves are Goldstone bosons. So Skyrmions are associated with broken symmetry.

Magnon: Broken magnetic symmetry, so yes.

Pion: Chiral symmetry, yes.

Wait, so all four options are particles that arise from broken symmetry? That can't be right because the question says which is not associated. So maybe I'm missing something.

Wait another thought: Phonons are quasiparticles, but do they emerge from symmetry breaking? Or are they more about the quantized vibrations due to the periodic lattice structure. The breaking of translational symmetry in solids leads to phonons as the quasiparticles. So yes, they are associated with broken symmetry.

Wait, but maybe the question is about whether the particle itself is a result of the symmetry breaking. Like, Goldstone's theorem says that for each broken continuous symmetry, there are massless bosons (Goldstone particles). Pions and magnons are Goldstone bosons (magnons are for magnetic symmetry breaking, pions for chiral). Phonons are more of a result of the lattice vibrations, but does it come from symmetry breaking?

Alternatively, maybe not all of them are Goldstone bosons. Let me think again.

In solids,
