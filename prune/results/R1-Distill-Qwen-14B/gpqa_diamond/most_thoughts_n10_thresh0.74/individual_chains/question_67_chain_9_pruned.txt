Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The problem says: Two electrons are in p orbital angular momentum states. We're ignoring their spin angular momentum. The coupled angular momentum state is given as |l1, l2, l, m> = |1,1,2,-1>. So l1 and l2 are 1 each, meaning each electron is in a p orbital. The total angular momentum quantum number l is 2, and m is -1.

The question is about measuring the orbital angular momentum components L1z and L2z for both electrons. We need to find the joint probability that both measurements yield -ħ.

Hmm. I remember that orbital angular momentum quantum numbers for each particle are l1 and l2. Each Lz eigenvalue is m multiplied by ħ, right? So for each electron, L_z can be -l to +l in integer steps.

Wait, so each electron can have m1 and m2 as -1, 0, +1 for l=1. So when we're talking about the coupled state, which is |1,1,2,-1>, we're looking at the total angular momentum state.

I think the state |1,1,2,-1> is a specific eigenstate of L² and Lz. But when considering the individual electrons' angular momenta, we need to express this coupled state in terms of the product states of the individual states.

So the coupled state is a combination of the possible |m1, m2> states that contribute to the total m = -1 and l=2.

Wait, the total m is m1 + m2. So in the coupled state, m_total = m1 + m2 = -1. Since each m1 and m2 can be -1, 0, +1, what combinations give a sum of -1?

Let me list all possible (m1, m2) pairs:

(-1, 0) → sum -1

(-1, 0) again? No, wait, m1 can be -1, 0, +1; same for m2. So the possible pairs that sum to -1 are:

(m1, m2) = (-1, 0), (0, -1). Are there any others? Let's see:

If m1 is 0, m2 must be -1: 0 + (-1) = -1.

If m1 is -1, m2 must be 0: (-1) + 0 = -1.

Are there other possibilities? What about m1=1 and m2=-2? No, because l=1, so m2 can't be -2. Similarly, m2 can't be beyond -1, 0, +1. So only those two possible pairs: (-1,0) and (0,-1).

Wait, but the state |1,1,2,-1> is a particular combination of these. Hmm.

I think when you combine two angular momenta, you get a state that's a linear combination of the product states of the individual m's. So the coupled state |l1=1, l2=1, L=2, M=-1> can be written as a sum over m1 and m2 where m1 + m2 = M.

So for M=-1, the possible terms are m1=-1, m2=0 and m1=0, m2=-1. So the coupled state is some combination of these two product states.

Wait, but in the problem, we're given the coupled state as |1,1,2,-1>, which is the state we're considering. So when we make a measurement of L1z and L2z, what do we get?

Wait, the problem asks for the joint probability that both L1z and L2z are measured as -ħ. So that would mean m1 = -1 and m2 = -1, because L_z = mħ.

But wait, in our coupled state, the possible m1 and m2 combinations are only (-1,0) and (0,-
