Okay, so I have this physics problem here about a spin-1/2 particle and magnetic fields. Hmm, I remember that spin-1/2 particles have their spin aligned in specific directions, and the magnetic moment is related to that. The question says the magnetic moment mu is gamma times Sz, which makes sense because Sz is the spin component in the z-direction.

So initially, the magnetic field is pointing in the +Z direction. The particle's moment is aligned with this field, so it's in the eigenstate of Sz. Then, suddenly the magnetic field is turned off and another one is turned on along the +Y direction, same magnitude B. Oh wait, when the field is turned off, the Hamiltonian must change because the magnetic field affects the energy of the particle.

Before the field was along Z, the Hamiltonian was proportional to Sz. After the field is switched to Y, the Hamiltonian becomes proportional to Sy. So the system's dynamics change because the Hamiltonian is no longer diagonal in the original basis. I think this is a problem about time evolution under a new Hamiltonian, leading to oscillations in expectation values.

The question asks about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment. So we need to find ⟨Sz⟩ as a function of time and determine its frequency.

I remember that when a system is subject to a Hamiltonian that's not diagonal in its initial state, the state will evolve, and expectation values can oscillate. For a two-level system, like spin-1/2, the oscillation frequency is often related to the energy splitting, which comes from the Hamiltonian.

Let me think about the energies. The original Hamiltonian was H_initial = -γ B Sz. But when the field is switched to Y, the new Hamiltonian H = -γ B Sy (since H = -μ·B, and μ = γ S). Wait, wait, the problem states that mu equals gamma times Sz, so the magnetic moment is in the z-direction. But when the field changes direction, the interaction becomes mu · B, which would be gamma Sz * B in the new direction. Wait, no: the dot product would be mu · B. If mu is in the z direction, but B is now in the y direction, then the dot product would be zero? That can't be right. Hmm, maybe I got that wrong.

Wait, no, the magnetic moment is given as mu = gamma S_z. Oh, wait, wait! No, I
