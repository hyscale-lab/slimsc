Okay, let me try to figure out this physics problem. So the question is about an annihilation process where a proton and an antiproton collide and produce two particles, A+ and A-. The mass of A is given as 300 MeV, and I need to find the velocity of particle A. The options are A) 0.77c, B) 0.96c, C) 0.91c, D) 0.86c.

Hmm, I remember that in particle physics, when particles annihilate, they convert into other particles. So, the initial particles are a proton and an antiproton. Wait, protons and antiprotons have the same mass, right? And their rest mass energy should be considered.

Wait, the rest mass of a proton is around 938 MeV/cÂ². So each, the proton and antiproton, have that mass. But in the problem, the mass of A is 300 MeV. So, the total rest mass of the products is 2*(300 MeV) = 600 MeV, but the initial rest mass is 2*(938 MeV) = 1876 MeV. That's a lot more. So the process must involve some kinetic energy as well.

But wait, the problem says that the antiproton is slowly moving. Oh, so the antiproton is moving slowly, which probably means that its kinetic energy is much less than its rest mass energy. So it's a non-relativistic situation perhaps? Or maybe it's better to think in terms of conservation of energy and momentum.

Wait, but in particle physics, when dealing with annihilation, the conservation laws are key. So I should think about conservation of energy and conservation of momentum.

But wait, the initial system is a proton and an antiproton. The proton is at rest, I think, because the antiproton is moving towards it. Oh wait, no, the problem says the antiproton is slowly moving. So maybe the initial setup is that the proton is stationary, and the antiproton is moving towards it with some velocity, but not too high since it's moving slowly.

Wait, but the problem states that the antiproton is slowly moving, which I think implies that its kinetic energy is much less than its rest mass energy. So perhaps in the center-of-momentum frame, things are simpler, but maybe in the lab frame, the proton is at rest, and
