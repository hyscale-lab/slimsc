Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about physical theories and regularization at high energies. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The question is asking which theory never requires regularization when dealing with high energies. The options are Superstring Theory, Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), Quantum Electrodynamics (QED), and Classical Electrodynamics.

Wait, what's regularization? Oh right, regularization is a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with divergences—like infinities that pop up in calculations. It helps make the theory mathematically consistent by introducing a cutoff or some other method to handle these infinities. But some theories might not need this because they're already finite or because their framework avoids such problems.

So, looking at the options:

Option A: Superstring Theory. I remember that string theory is supposed to be a theory of quantum gravity. Because it's a theory that includes gravity, it's often considered a candidate for a theory of everything. String theory deals with higher dimensions and is based on the idea that particles are actually vibrating strings. But does it require regularization? I think string theories, especially the perturbative ones, might have issues with divergences, but wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe because they're background-dependent, or perhaps they don't have the same kinds of divergences as other QFTs since they're dealing with strings instead of point particles. Or maybe they require regularization. Hmm, I'm not too certain here.

Option B: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). QCD is the theory of the strong interaction. It's a non-abelian gauge theory, similar to QED but with SU(3) symmetry. I know that QCD has issues with things like infrared slavery, but what about high energies? Well, at high energies (or equivalently, at short distances), QCD becomes asymptotically free, meaning the coupling constant decreases. But when you calculate loop diagrams in QCD, you can get divergences. So, do they require regularization? Yes, because you need to handle those infinities. QCD calculations often use techniques like lattice regularization or others. So B probably requires regularization.

Option C: Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). QED is the quantum version of electromagnetism. It's a well-established theory. But I remember that in QED, you have things like the electron self-energy or photon vacuum polarization which lead to divergent loop integrals. These require renormalization, which is a form of regularization. So, QED does require regularization. So C is out.

Option D: Classical Electrodynamics. Wait, this is the non-quantum version. In classical theory, like Maxwell's equations, you don't have the same kind of infinities that require regularization. Because in the classical case, you don't have issues like charge density divergences in point particles—well, actually, point charges do have some issues, like the infinite self-energy. But in classical physics, how is that handled? Wait, in reality, classical electromagnetism doesn't really require regularization because it's a classical theory. It might have some singularities, but those aren't treated with regularization since regularization is a quantum field theory concept. So D probably doesn't require regularization.

So the question is which theory never requires regularization. So the options are A and D.

Wait, the question
