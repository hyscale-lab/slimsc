Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question carefully.

The problem starts with Compound A, which is C3H6. Hmm, wait, wait. C3H6 is propene, right? Because propene is C3H6 (double bond), and propane is C3H8. So A is propene.

Then, A undergoes bromination in the presence of carbon tetrachloride. Oh, right, bromination of alkenes with Br2 usually adds across the double bond. So propene (CH2CH2CH3?) Wait no, wait. Propene is CH2=CHCH3. When it reacts with Br2, it should form 1,2-dibromopropane. Wait, no—wait, actually, when an alkene reacts with Br2, it's a diaddition. So the product B would be 1,2-dibromopropane, which is CH2Br-CHBr-CH3. So that's compound B.

Next, compound B reacts with alcoholic KOH. Oh, that's a dehydrohalogenation reaction, an elimination. But wait, compound B is 1,2-dibromopropane. When you treat that with alcoholic KOH, which is a strong base, it would eliminate HBr twice, right? So each Br is adjacent, so the base would abstract a β-hydrogen, leading to elimination of HBr, forming a double bond. But wait, since we have
