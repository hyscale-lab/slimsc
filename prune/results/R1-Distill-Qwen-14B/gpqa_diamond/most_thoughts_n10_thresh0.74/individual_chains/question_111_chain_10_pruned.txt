Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reactions. But I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question has two parts, reactions A and B, and I need to find the major products for each. Then I'll match them with the options given.

Starting with reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one is reacting with ethyl acrylate in the presence of t-BuOK. Hmm, t-BuOK is a strong, bulky base, so maybe this is an enolate formation reaction. Since the starting material is a ketone, the base will deprotonate it to form an enolate.

Wait, where's the alpha hydrogen here? The ketone is at position 1 (cyclohexan-1-one). The carbonyl group is at C1. So the alpha carbons would be C2 and C6, I think. But wait, the structure is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexanone. So the carbonyl is at C1, and C2 has an ethyl and a methyl group, and C6 has a methyl as well.

So the alpha positions are C2 and C3 maybe? Wait, no. Let me draw the structure. The cyclohexane ring has substituents at C1 (the carbonyl), C2 (ethyl and methyl), C6 (methyl). So the possible alpha hydrogens are on C2 and C3? Or wait, the carbonyl is at C1, so the adjacent carbons are C2 and C6.

Wait, the structure is: the ring has a carbonyl group at C1. Then, C2 has an ethyl and a methyl group. C6 has a methyl. So the possible alpha hydrogens are on C2 and C6? Or maybe C3? I'm getting a bit confused.

In any case, when t-BuOK is used, it usually deprotonates the less hindered alpha hydrogen. Since the base is bulky, it prefers to abstract the hydrogen that's more accessible, which is the less hindered one.

Looking at the structure, C2 has two substituents (ethyl and methyl), so the alpha hydrogens there are probably more hindered. C6 has a methyl group, but perhaps the alpha hydrogen there is less hindered than C2. Or maybe there's another position with even less hindrance.

Wait, another possibility: the cyclohexanone has substituents at C2 and C6. The enolate can form either at C2 or C3, depending on where the hydrogen is. But perhaps the base abstracts the hydrogen that leads to the more stable enolate. The more substituted the enolate, the more stable it is.

Alternatively, maybe the enolate forms at the more substituted position. Since the base is bulky, it would form the less substituted enolate because the more substituted positions are more hindered.

Wait, no. Bulky bases tend to form the less substituted enolate because they can't attack the more hindered positions. So the less substituted (more accessible) alpha hydrogen is deprotonated.

So in the cyclohexanone derivative, which alpha position is more accessible? Let's think about the structure.

The starting material is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. So the C2 has ethyl and methyl groups, making it quite bulky. The C6 has a methyl. So the H's on C2 are more hindered. The alpha H's on C3 could be possible, but wait, wait. Wait, the carbonyl is at C1, so the adjacent carbons are C2 (alpha) and perhaps C6 (which is another alpha position as well).

Wait, maybe I should number the carbons properly. Let me imagine the cyclohexane ring: C1 is the carbonyl. So going around the ring, C2 is next to C1, then C3, etc. So C6 is adjacent to C1 as well, because
