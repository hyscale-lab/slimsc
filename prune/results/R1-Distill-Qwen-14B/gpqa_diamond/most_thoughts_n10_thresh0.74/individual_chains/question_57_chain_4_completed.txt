Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the scattering of electrons from a nuclear target. The question is about calculating the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to work through it.

Alright, the problem gives me phase shifts for different values of l. The phase shifts are δ₀=90°, δ₁=67°, δ₂=55°, δ₃=30°, and δ₄=13°. We're told to ignore the rest of the phase shifts, which I guess means we can stop at l=4, since higher l's aren't considered here.

Wait, the question is about the scattering amplitude's imaginary part. I remember that in scattering theory, the scattering amplitude f(θ, φ) can be expressed in terms of the partial waves. The formula is something like the sum over l of (2l+1) [ e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l / (i k r) ] * something involving the Legendre polynomials. Oh wait, more specifically, the scattering amplitude f is given by:

f(k,θ,φ) = (1/(2ik)) * Σ ( (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l P_l(cosθ) ) )

But wait, the question is specifically asking for the imaginary part along the incident direction. Along the incident beam direction, θ would be zero degrees, right? Because the beam is going along, say, the z-axis. So when θ is 0, cosθ is 1. So the Legendre polynomial P_l(cosθ) becomes P_l(1), which is 1 for all l. Because P₀(1)=1, P₁(1)=1, etc. Wait, no, wait. Wait, P_l(1) is actually equal to 1 for all l? Because Legendre polynomials evaluated at 1 are 1. Yeah, that's right.

So the expression simplifies to f = (1/(2ik)) * Σ ( (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l ) because P_l(1)=1 for all l.

But we're only considering up to l=4, as given. So the sum runs from l=0 to l=4.

Now, the scattering amplitude f has both real and imaginary parts. The question asks for the imaginary part along the beam direction, which is θ=0. So I need to compute the imaginary part of f(k,0,φ).

Wait, but in the formula, the overall factor is 1/(2ik). So let's factor that in. The term (1/(2ik)) can be written as (1/(2i k)).

Let me think: Let's write f as:

f = [1/(2i k)] * Σ [ (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l ]

Because P_l(1) = 1.

But e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l can be simplified. Let's see: e^{i δ} = cos δ + i sin δ. So e^{i δ} sin δ = sin δ (cos δ + i sin δ) = sin δ cos δ + i sin² δ.

So when I sum over all l, each term contributes a part with sin δ cos δ (real) and i sin² δ (imaginary). So when I take the sum, let's separate real and imaginary parts.

So, f = [1/(2i k)] * [ Σ (2l+1)(sin δ_l cos δ_l) + i Σ (2l+1) sin² δ_l ) ]

So, f = [1/(2i k)] [ A + i B ], where A is the sum of real parts and B the sum of (2l+1) sin² δ_l.

Now, let's compute this. The denominator is 2i k. So let's write it as (A + i B)/(2i k).

Let me separate the real and imaginary parts. Let's write the numerator as (A + i B) = A + i B.

So f = [A + i B]/(2i k) = [A/(2i k)] + [i B/(2i k)].

Simplify each term:

A/(2i k) = (A)/(2i k) = [A/(2k)] * (1/i) ) = [A/(2k)] * (-i) ) because 1/i = -i.

Similarly, [i B]/(2i k) = B/(2k) * [i/(i)] = B/(2k) * 1.

So f = [ -i A/(2k) ] + [ B/(2k) ]

So the real part of f is B/(2k), and the imaginary part is (-A)/(2k).

But wait, the question asks for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude. So the imaginary part is (-A)/(2k), where A is the sum over l of (2l+1) sin δ_l cos δ_l.

Wait, but let's make sure. The full expression for f is:

f = (1/(2ik)) * sum [ (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l ]

As before, so after expansion, f = [sum ( (2l+1)(sin δ cos δ) ) + i sum ( (2l+1) sin^2 δ ) ] / (2i k )

So when you split into real and imaginary parts:

The real part comes from the terms that are real when divided by 2ik, which is when the numerator is imaginary. Wait, perhaps an alternative approach: Let me factor out 1/(2ik). So:

f = (1/(2ik)) * sum [ (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l ]

Each term in the sum is (2l+1) [ sin δ_l (cos δ_l + i sin δ_l) ]

Which is (2l+1) [ sin δ_l cos δ_l + i sin² δ_l ]

So the sum is sum_real + i sum_imag, where sum_real = sum ( (2l+1) sin δ_l cos δ_l ), and sum_imag = sum ( (2l+1) sin² δ_l )

Thus, f = [ sum_real + i sum_imag ] / (2i k )

We can write this as:

f = [ sum_real/(2i k) ) ] + [ i sum_imag/(2i k) ) ]

Simplify each term:

sum_real/(2i k) = sum_real/(2k) * (1/i) = -i sum_real/(2k )

i sum_imag/(2i k ) = sum_imag/(2k )

So f = [ -i sum_real/(2k ) ] + [ sum_imag/(2k ) ]

Thus, the real part of f is sum_imag/(2k ), and the imaginary part is - sum_real/(2k )

Therefore, the imaginary part Im(f) is [ - sum_real ] / (2k )

Wait, but the question is about the imaginary part. So Im(f) = - sum_real/(2k )

Wait, but I should double-check the sign. Let's recheck the expansion.

f = [ sum_real + i sum_imag ] / (2i k )

Which can be written as (sum_real)/(2i k) + (i sum_imag)/(2i k )

sum_real/(2i k) = [ sum_real / (2k) ] * (1/i) → which is sum_real/(2k) * (-i) → -i sum_real/(2k )

Similarly, (i sum_imag)/(2i k ) = [ sum_imag ]/(2k )

So adding them, f = [ -i sum_real/(2k ) ] + [ sum_imag/(2k ) ]

So f has a real part (sum_imag)/(2k) and an imaginary part (-sum_real)/(2k )

So the imaginary part is Im(f) = [ - sum_real ] / (2k )

Wait, but wait, 2i k is in the denominator. I'm a bit confused about the signs, but let's proceed.

The sum_real is the sum over l=0 to 4 of (2l+1) sin δ_l cos δ_l.

Compute that first.

So for each l from 0 to 4:

l=0: (2*0 +1)=1. δ₀=90°. So sin(90°)=1, cos(90°)=0. So term is 1 * 1 * 0 = 0.

l=1: (2*1+1)=3. δ₁=67°. sin(67)=approx 0.9205, cos(67)=approx 0.3907. So 3 * 0.9205 * 0.3907 ≈ 3 * 0.36 (approx) → about 1.08.

But let me compute it more accurately.

sin(67°) ≈ 0.92050485345

cos(67°) ≈ 0.390731128489

So term is 3 * 0.92050485 * 0.390731128 ≈ 3 * 0.360099 (since 0.92 * 0.39 ≈ 0.3598) → about 1.080297.

l=2: (2*2+1)=5. δ₂=55°. sin(55)=0.81915204428, cos(55)=0.57357643635. So 5 * 0.819152 * 0.573576 ≈ 5 * (0.819152 * 0.573576). Let me compute 0.819152 * 0.573576.

0.8 * 0.57 = 0.456. 0.019152*0.57≈0.01094. So approximately 0.467. So 5 * 0.467 → 2.335. Let me compute precisely.

0.819152 * 0.573576 = ?

Well, 0.8 * 0.573576 = 0.4588608.

0.019152 * 0.573576 ≈ approx 0.01102.

So total ≈ 0.4588608 + 0.01102 = 0.46988. So 5 * 0.46988 ≈ 2.3494.

l=3: (2*3 +1)=7. δ3=30°. sin(30)=0.5, cos(30)=√3/2 ≈0.8660254.

So term is 7 * 0.5 * 0.8660254 = 7 * (0.4330127) ≈ 3.031089.

l=4: (2*4+1)=9. δ4=13°. sin(13)=0.224951, cos(13)=0.974370.

So term is 9 * 0.224951 * 0.974370 ≈ 9 * (0.224951 * 0.974370). Let's compute 0.224951 * 0.974370.

0.224951 * 0.974370 ≈ 0.224951 * 0.974 ≈ 0.2195. So 9 * 0.2195 ≈ 1.9755.

Wait, let me do it more accurately.

0.224951 * 0.974370 = ?

0.2 * 0.97437 = 0.194874.

0.024951 * 0.97437 ≈ 0.02422.

So total ≈ 0.194874 + 0.02422 ≈ 0.219094.

Multiply by 9: 9 * 0.219094 ≈ 1.971846.

Now, sum all these terms for l=0 to 4.

l=0: 0.

l=1: 1.080297.

l=2: 2.3494.

l=3:3.031089.

l=4:1.971846.

Sum these:

0 + 1.080297 =1.080297

+2.3494 → 3.429697

+3.031089 → 6.460786

+1.971846 → 8.432632.

So sum_real ≈ 8.432632.

Then, Im(f) = [ - sum_real ] / (2k )

Wait wait, no. Earlier, I thought Im(f) is [ - sum_real ]/(2k ), but wait. Let me recheck.

Wait, from the earlier steps:

f = [ -i sum_real/(2k) ] + [ sum_imag/(2k) ]

So the imaginary part of f is the coefficient of 'i', which is -sum_real/(2k).

Wait, but wait, the 'i' is a factor, so the imaginary part is the coefficient multiplied by i. So for f = a + i b, the imaginary part is b. But in our case, f = [sum_imag/(2k) ] + [ -i sum_real/(2k) ].

Wait, no, wait: f = [sum_real + i sum_imag]/(2i k )

Which can be written as (sum_real)/(2i k ) + (i sum_imag)/(2i k )

Which is (sum_real)/(2i k ) + sum_imag/(2k )

But 1/(i) is -i, so sum_real/(2i k ) = sum_real * (-i) / (2k )

So f = [ -i sum_real/(2k) ) ] + [ sum_imag/(2k) ]

So f's real part is sum_imag/(2k ), and the coefficient of i is (- sum_real )/(2k )

Wait, but the imaginary part is the coefficient of 'i', so Im(f) = [ - sum_real ]/(2k )

Wait, because the term is (- sum_real/(2k )) * i.

So Im(f) = (- sum_real)/(2k )

Wait, but I thought earlier that Im(f) was [ - sum_real ]/(2k )

Wait, but let's re-check. Let me write f as:

f = [ -i sum_real/(2k) ] + [ sum_imag/(2k) ]

So f = (sum_imag/(2k )) + ( - sum_real/(2k )) * i.

So in terms of a + ib, a is sum_imag/(2k ), and b is [ - sum_real/(2k ) ]

Therefore, the imaginary part Im(f) = - sum_real/(2k )

Hmm. So we have Im(f) = - sum_real/(2k )

Wait, but wait, the question is about the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude. So I thought the question is about the imaginary part, which would be Im(f) = [ - sum_real ]/(2k )

But wait, in the problem statement, is the phase shift given as δ_l or as the other way around? Because sometimes, people define the phase shift as δ, and the amplitude has terms involving e^{2i δ} or something else. Did I get the formula correctly?

Wait, another thought: I think the formula for the scattering amplitude is:

f(k,θ,φ) = ∑_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) e^{2i δ_l} [ sin δ_l / (k r) ] P_l(cosθ)

Wait, no, maybe another version. Let me think. I think the correct formula for the scattering amplitude in terms of partial waves is:

f(θ,φ) = (1/(2ik)) ∑_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) e^{2i δ_l} sin δ_l P_l(cosθ)

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the correct expression is:

f(θ,φ) = (1/k) ∑_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l P_l(cosθ)

Wait, that doesn't make sense dimensionally. Hmm. I'm a bit confused.

Wait, perhaps the correct expression is:

f = (1/(2ik)) ∑_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l P_l(cosθ)

But I'm not 100% confident. Alternatively, perhaps it's:

f = (1/(2ik)) ∑ (2l+1) [ e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l ] P_l(cosθ )

So when θ=0, P_l(1)=1 for all l, so f becomes:

f = (1/(2ik)) ∑ (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l

Which is similar to what I had before.

But wait, in that case, the expression e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps it's e^{2i δ_l} sin δ_l, but that's unclear.

Wait, perhaps I should double-check the formula. The standard partial wave expansion for scattering amplitude is:

f(θ,φ) = (1/(2ik)) ∑_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) e^{2i δ_l} sin δ_l P_l(cosθ)

Ah, that might be the correct formula.

Wait, in that case, we have e^{2i δ_l} sin δ_l.

So let me correct that.

So with that, the expression becomes:

f = (1/(2ik)) ∑ (2l+1) e^{2i δ_l} sin δ_l P_l(cosθ )

Then, when θ=0, P_l(1)=1, so f= (1/(2ik)) ∑ (2l+1) e^{2i δ_l} sin δ_l.

So expanding e^{2i δ_l} sin δ_l:

e^{2i δ} = cos(2δ) + i sin(2δ).

So,

e^{2i δ} sin δ = [cos(2δ) + i sin(2δ)] * sin δ.

Which becomes cos(2δ) sin δ + i sin(2δ) sin δ.

So, the real part is cos(2δ) sin δ, and the imaginary part is sin(2δ) sin δ.

So each term in the sum contributes a real part (2l+1) cos(2δ_l) sin δ_l and an imaginary part (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) sin δ_l.

So the entire sum is sum_real + i sum_imag, where:

sum_real = ∑ (2l+1) cos(2δ_l) sin δ_l,

sum_imag = ∑ (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) sin δ_l.

So f = [ sum_real + i sum_imag ] / (2ik )

Then, f = sum_real/(2ik) + i sum_imag/(2ik )

We can break this into real and imaginary parts.

sum_real/(2ik) = sum_real/(2k) * (1/(i)) = sum_real/(2k) * (-i )

i sum_imag/(2ik ) = sum_imag/(2k )

So f = [ sum_imag/(2k) ) ] + i [ - sum_real/(2k) ) ]

Thus, the real part of f is sum_imag/(2k ), and the imaginary part is [ - sum_real/(2k) ]

Wait, that's different from before because the formula changed.

So, the Im(f) is [ - sum_real ]/(2k )

Now, sum_real is ∑ (2l+1) cos(2δ_l) sin δ_l, for l=0 to 4.

So let's compute this sum.

Given δ_l for l=0 to 4:

l=0: δ=90°, so 2δ=180°, cos(180°)=-1. sin(90°)=1.

So term for l=0: 1 * (-1) * 1 = -1.

l=1: δ=67°, 2δ=134°, cos(134°)=cos(180-46)= -cos(46)≈-0.69465837.

sin(67)=0.92050485.

So term: 3 * (-0.694658) * 0.920505 ≈ 3 * (-0.6402) ≈ -1.9206.

l=2: δ=55°, 2δ=110°, cos(110°)=cos(180-70)= -cos(70)≈-0.3420201.

sin(55)=0.819152. So term:5 * (-0.3420201) * 0.819152 ≈5 * (-0.2809) ≈-1.4045.

l=3: δ=30°, 2δ=60°, cos(60)=0.5. sin(30)=0.5.

Term:7 * 0.5 * 0.5 =7 * 0.25=1.75.

l=4: δ=13°, 2δ=26°, cos(26)≈0.898794. sin(13)=0.224951.

So term:9 * 0.898794 * 0.224951 ≈9 * (0.2030) ≈1.827.

Now sum these terms:

l=0: -1.

l=1: -1.9206 → sum so far: -2.9206.

l=2: -1.4045 → sum: -4.3251.

l=3: +1.75 → sum: -4.3251 +1.75 = -2.5751.

l=4: +1.827 → sum: -2.5751 +1.827 ≈ -0.7481.

So sum_real ≈ -0.7481.

Then, Im(f) = (- sum_real )/(2k )

Wait, because Im(f) is [ - sum_real ]/(2k )

Wait, no, earlier conclusion was Im(f) = [ - sum_real ]/(2k )

Wait, wait, wait: in this current approach, sum_real is the sum of (2l+1) cos(2δ_l) sin δ_l.

Im(f) = [ - sum_real ]/(2k )

So sum_real is -0.7481. So -sum_real is +0.7481.

So Im(f) = 0.7481/(2k )

Wait, what's k?

k is the wave number, which is given by (2π/λ), where λ is the wavelength. But wait, wait, the energy is given as 50 MeV for the electrons. So I need to compute k using the energy.

But wait, I'm a bit confused about the units. Let me think.

The electrons have energy E=50 MeV. Since electrons have rest mass approximately 0.511 MeV/c². So E is much larger than the rest mass, so relativistic effects are important.

The momentum p can be found using the relativistic energy relation.

For high energies, E ≈ pc. So p ≈ E/c.

In natural units (c=1), p ≈ E.

But for the exact computation, perhaps it's better to compute p accurately.

The energy for a relativistic electron is given by E² = (pc)^2 + (m c²)^2.

Rearranging, (pc)^2 = E² - (m c²)^2.

So p = sqrt( E² - (m c²)^2 ) / c.

But E is given as 50 MeV, and m c² is 0.511 MeV.

So, E² = (50)^2 = 2500 (MeV)^2.

(m c²)^2 = (0.511)^2 ≈ 0.261121 (MeV)^2.

So (pc)^2 = 2500 - 0.261121 ≈ 2499.738879 (MeV)^2.

So pc = sqrt(2499.738879) ≈ 49.99738879 MeV.

Thus, p ≈ 49.99738879 MeV/c.

But in natural units (ħ = c =1), p has units of MeV.

But wait, the wave number k is given by k = p/ħ.

But to find k, we need to compute p in appropriate units.

Wait, but I'm a bit stuck on the exact units here. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the Compton wavelength is involved. But perhaps a better approach is to compute the wave number k in units where ħ = c =1.

Wait, in natural units, ħ = c =1, so k = p.

But in that case, the wave number k would be in GeV⁻¹, perhaps.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute k in terms of the momentum and the reduced Planck constant.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let's think in terms of eV and meters.

The Planck constant ħ is approximately 197.327 MeV·fm. So 1 MeV·fm = 1.97327 ×10^−16 J·m.

Wait, but perhaps I should compute k as follows.

In natural units, where c=1 and ħ=1, the energy E is in MeV, momentum p is in MeV/c, and k is p/(ħ c) → but wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, since k = p / ħ, and p is in MeV/c, and ħ is in MeV·fm.

Wait, let me get the units straight.

p is in MeV/c. ħ is in MeV·fm.

So, k = p / ħ → units: (MeV/(c)) / (MeV·fm) ) → (1/(c fm) )

But since c is in fm per second? Wait, no, units are a bit messy. Alternatively, perhaps we can compute k in terms of 1/fm.

But let me think numerically.

p = 49.99738879 MeV/c. (As computed earlier.)

ħ = 197.327 MeV·fm.

So k = p / ħ = (49.99738879 MeV/c) / (197.327 MeV·fm )

The MeV units cancel. The c is in terms of (fm/s), but let me see.

Wait, 1/c = (1 fm)/(1 fm/s) )= s/fm.

Wait, perhaps another approach: let's compute k in 1/fm units.

k = p/(ħ c) → but wait, no, because k = p/ħ, but p is in MeV/c, and ħ is in MeV·fm.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute in terms of units where c=1 and ħ=197.327 MeV·fm.

Wait, perhaps I should compute k in units of inverse femtometers.

So, from p = 49.99738879 MeV/c.

But c = 3e8 m/s, but in terms of fm, 1 fm = 1e-15 m.

So, 1 fm = 1e-15 m → 1 m = 1e15 fm.

Time in seconds: 1 s = 1e15 fm * (3e8 m/s) → Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, maybe I should just compute k as p/(ħ c) in appropriate units.

Wait, p is 49.99738879 MeV/c.

ħ c is 197.327 MeV·fm.

So, k = p/(ħ c) → (49.99738879 MeV/c ) / (197.327 MeV·fm) )

The MeV units cancel. The c is in m/s, and fm is 1e-15 m. So, 1/(fm) = 1e15 m⁻¹.

So:

k = (49.99738879 [MeV/(m/s)]) / (197.327 MeV·fm )

= [49.99738879 / 197.327 ] [ (1/(m/s)) / (fm) ]

Convert fm to m: 1 fm = 1e-15 m. So 1/fm = 1e15 m⁻¹.

So,

k = (49.99738879 / 197.327) * (1/(m/s) ) * (1e15 m⁻¹ ) 

Wait, this approach is getting too tangled. Let me think numerically.

Wait, perhaps we can compute k numerically using the fact that k = p/(ħ c) → But in units where ħ c ≈ 197 MeV·fm, so k (in 1/fm) = p (in MeV/c) / (197.327 MeV·fm )

So,

k = (49.99738879 MeV/c) / (197.327 MeV·fm )

= 49.99738879 / 197.327 (1/(c fm)) 

But c in terms of 1 fm per unit time.

Wait, perhaps to compute this, it's better to note that 1 fm/c is the speed of light in units where it's per fm.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute k as:

k = (p) / ħ 

But p is in MeV/c, and ħ is in MeV·fm.

So, k = [ (49.99738879 MeV/c ) ] / [ 197.327 MeV·fm )

= (49.99738879 / 197.327 ) [ (MeV/(c)) / (MeV·fm) ) ] 

The MeV cancels, giving [ 1/(c fm) ]

But c is in m/s, and fm is 1e-15 m.

Wait, perhaps this is getting too complicated. Let me instead compute k numerically.

We have p ≈49.99738879 MeV/c.

k = p/(ħ c).

But ħ c is 197.327 MeV·fm.

So,

k = (49.99738879 MeV/c) / (197.327 MeV·fm )

The MeV cancels, so:

k = (49.99738879 / 197.327 ) (1/(c fm) )

But 1/(c) is in s/m, so to get the units right, perhaps it's better to think in terms of 1/fm.

Alternatively, perhaps my confusion arises because I'm mixing natural units and SI units. Maybe an alternative approach is to compute k in terms of 1/fm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look for a formula that gives k in terms of E and the mass.

Wait, the relation between E and k is:

E² = (ħ c k )² + (m c²)^2

Rearranged, (ħ c k )² = E² - (m c²)^2.

So,

k = sqrt( (E² - (m c²)^2 ) ) / (ħ c )

But E is 50 MeV, m c² is 0.511 MeV.

So,

k = sqrt( (50)^2 - (0.511)^2 ) / (ħ c )

= sqrt(2500 - 0.261) / (197.327 MeV·fm )

= sqrt(2499.739) / 197.327 ≈ 49.9974 / 197.327 ≈ 0.25369 fm⁻¹.

So k ≈ 0.25369 fm⁻¹.

Wait, but that can't be, because when I compute 49.99738879 / 197.327, I get approximately 0.25369.

Wait, yes, that's correct. So k ≈ 0.2537 fm⁻¹.

So now, sum_real is approximately -0.7481.

Thus, Im(f) = [ - sum_real ]/(2k ) = [0.7481 ]/(2 * 0.25369 )

Compute denominator: 2 * 0.25369 ≈ 0.50738.

So Im(f) = 0.7481 / 0.50738 ≈ 1.475 fm.

Wait, but that doesn't match any of the options. The options are in the range of tens to hundreds of fm.

Wait, that suggests I made a mistake somewhere.

Hmm, perhaps I messed up the formula for the scattering amplitude.

Wait, perhaps I should go back and double-check. Maybe the formula is different. Let me think again.

Alternative approach:

The scattering amplitude f is given by:

f(θ, φ) = (1/(2ik)) sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l P_l (cosθ )

Wait, but I'm not sure. Another possibility is that the amplitude is:

f(k,θ,φ) = sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) [ e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l ] (P_l(cosθ) ) / (k r )

But I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is:

f(k,θ,φ) = (1/(2ik)) sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) e^{2i δ_l} sin δ_l P_l (cosθ )

In this case, the expansion of e^{2i δ} sin δ would be:

e^{2i δ} sin δ = [cos(2δ) + i sin(2δ)] * sin δ = cos(2δ) sin δ + i sin(2δ) sin δ.

So each term contributes a real part (2l+1) cos(2δ) sin δ and an imaginary part (2l+1) sin(2δ) sin δ.

So when θ=0, P_l(1)=1. So the sum_real is sum of (2l+1) cos(2δ_l) sin δ_l, and sum_imag is sum of (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) sin δ_l.

Then, f = [ sum_real + i sum_imag ] / (2ik )

So, f = sum_real/(2ik) + i sum_imag/(2ik )

Which simplifies to:

sum_real/(2i k) + sum_imag/(2k )

Which is:

[ sum_real i ]/(2k) ) + [ sum_imag ]/(2k )

Because 1/(i) is -i.

So, f = [ sum_imag/(2k) ] + i [ ( - sum_real )/(2k) ]

Thus, the real part is sum_imag/(2k ), and the imaginary part is [ -sum_real ]/(2k )

But according to this, Im(f) = [ -sum_real ]/(2k )

Wait, but when I computed sum_real as about -0.7481, and k≈0.2537 fm⁻¹, Im(f) would be (0.7481)/(2 * 0.2537) ≈ 1.475 fm.

But the options are much larger.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating sum_real.

Wait, let me re-calculate sum_real for l=0 to 4 using the correct formula.

sum_real = sum ( (2l+1) cos(2δ_l) sin δ_l )

Compute each term:

l=0: (2l+1)=1, δ=90°, 2δ=180°. cos(180)= -1, sin(90)=1. So term=1 * (-1) * 1 = -1.

l=1: δ=67°, 2δ=134°. cos(134)≈-0.69465837. sin(67)=0.92050485. So term=3 * (-0.69465837) * 0.92050485 ≈ 3 * (-0.639) ≈ -1.917.

l=2: δ=55°, 2δ=110°. cos(110)=cos(180-70)= -cos(70)= -0.3420201. sin(55)=0.81915204. term=5*(-0.3420201)*0.81915204 ≈5*(-0.2809)≈-1.4045.

l=3: δ=30°, 2δ=60°, cos(60)=0.5. sin(30)=0.5. term=7*0.5*0.5=7*0.25=1.75.

l=4: δ=13°, 2δ=26°, cos(26)=0.898794. sin(13)=0.224951. term=9 * 0.898794 *0.224951 ≈9*(0.2030)=1.827.

Now sum these:

l=0: -1 → sum=-1.

l=1: -1.917 → sum=-2.917.

l=2: -1.4045 → sum=-4.3215.

l=3: +1.75 → sum= -4.3215 +1.75 = -2.5715.

l=4: +1.827 → sum= -2.5715 +1.827= -0.7445.

So sum_real≈-0.7445.

Thus, Im(f) = [ - sum_real ]/(2k ) = [0.7445 ]/(2*0.2537) → 0.7445/(0.5074) ≈1.466 fm.

But again, this would be about 1.466 fm, but the options are in the hundreds.

Wait, that's way off. So perhaps this approach is wrong. Or perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Alternative approach: Perhaps the scattering amplitude f is given by:

f(k,θ,φ) = sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) [ sin δ_l e^{i δ_l} ] (P_l(cosθ)) / (ik )

But then, when θ=0, the sum would be sum (2l+1) sin δ_l e^{i δ_l}.

Wait, but then f would have real and imaginary parts. Let me think.

Wait, perhaps I should look for another approach. Alternatively, perhaps the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude is given directly by the sum of (2l+1) sin δ_l, because I'm getting conflicting results and perhaps I'm missing a factor.

Wait, wait. Let me think of the partial wave expansion for the scattering amplitude. The formula is:

f(θ, φ) = (1/(2ik)) Σ (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l P_l(cosθ )

So when θ=0, P_l(1)=1, so:

f = (1/(2ik)) Σ (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l.

Now, e^{i δ} = cos δ + i sin δ.

So,

f = (1/(2ik)) Σ (2l+1) [ cos δ_l + i sin δ_l ] sin δ_l.

= (1/(2ik)) Σ (2l+1) [ cos δ_l sin δ_l + i sin² δ_l ]

= (1/(2ik)) [ Σ (2l+1) cos δ_l sin δ_l + i Σ (2l+1) sin² δ_l ]

So f = [ A + i B ]/(2ik ), where A = sum (2l+1) cos δ_l sin δ_l, and B= sum (2l+1) sin² δ_l.

Now, we can write this as:

f = (A + i B)/(2ik ) = (A/(2ik )) + (i B)/(2ik )

= (A i )/(2k ) ) + (B)/(2k )

Because 1/(2ik ) = (1/(2k )) * (1/i ) = (1/(2k )) * (-i )

Similarly, i/(2ik ) = 1/(2k )

So,

f = ( -i A )/(2k ) + B/(2k )

Which is f = B/(2k ) - i A/(2k )

Thus, the real part of f is B/(2k ), and the imaginary part is [ -A/(2k ) ]

So, Im(f) = -A/(2k )

So, A is the sum of (2l+1) cos δ_l sin δ_l for l=0 to4.

Let me compute A:

l=0: 1 * cos(90) sin(90) = 1 * 0 * 1 = 0.

l=1: 3 * cos(67) sin(67) → cos(67)=0.3907, sin(67)=0.9205.

So 3 * 0.3907 * 0.9205 ≈3 * 0.3600 →1.08.

l=2:5 * cos(55) sin(55) → cos(55)=0.5736, sin(55)=0.8192.

5 * 0.5736 * 0.8192 ≈5 * 0.4709 ≈2.3545.

l=3:7 * cos(30) sin(30) → cos(30)=√3/2≈0.8660, sin(30)=0.5.

7 * 0.8660 * 0.5 →7 * 0.4330 ≈3.031.

l=4:9 * cos(13) sin(13) → cos(13)=0.9744, sin(13)=0.22495.

9 * 0.9744 * 0.22495 ≈9 * 0.219 →1.971.

Sum these:

l=0: 0.

l=1:1.08 → sum=1.08.

l=2:2.3545 → sum=3.4345.

l=3:3.031 → sum=6.4655.

l=4:1.971 → sum=8.4365.

So A≈8.4365.

Then, Im(f) = -A/(2k ) = -8.4365/(2k )

k was computed as approximately 0.2537 fm⁻¹.

So,

Im(f) = -8.4365/(2 * 0.2537) ≈ -8.4365/(0.5074) ≈-16.63 fm.

Wait, but the options are all positive, so perhaps I made a sign mistake.

Wait, in this approach, Im(f) is -A/(2k ). A is 8.4365. So Im(f)= -8.4365/(2*0.2537) ≈ -16.63 fm.

But the options are all positive, so perhaps the magnitude is what's important.

But looking at the options: option B is 355.351 fm; option C is 177.675; D is 251.271.

Hmm, 16.63 is not among the options. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should compute k correctly. Earlier, I computed k as ≈0.2537 fm⁻¹. But perhaps that's incorrect.

Wait, let's recompute k.

We have E = 50 MeV, m c² = 0.511 MeV.

So,

k = sqrt( (E/(ħ c) )² - (m c/(ħ))² ) 

Wait, perhaps another approach: since E ≫ m c², we can approximate k ≈ E/(ħ c ), because the m term is negligible.

So,

k ≈ E/(ħ c )

But in units where ħ c = 197.327 MeV·fm.

So,

k ≈ 50 MeV / (197.327 MeV·fm ) ≈ 0.2536 fm⁻¹.

Which is what I had before.

Alternatively, perhaps the wave number is k = E/(ħ c) → 50 / 197.327 ≈ 0.2536 fm⁻¹.

Hmm, that's the same as before.

So Im(f) is -16.63 fm, but the options don't have that. So perhaps this approach is wrong.

Wait, another possibility is that the formula for f is different, and the imaginary part is the sum of (2l+1) sin δ_l.

Wait, let me think. Maybe the imaginary part is sum ( (2l+1) sin δ_l ) / (2k )

But let's compute that.

Compute sum (2l+1) sin δ_l:

l=0: (1) * sin(90) =1 *1=1.

l=1:3 * sin(67)≈3 *0.9205=2.7615.

l=2:5 * sin(55)≈5*0.8192=4.096.

l=3:7 * sin(30)=7*0.5=3.5.

l=4:9 * sin(13)=9 *0.22495≈2.0245.

Sum these: 1 + 2.7615=3.7615 +4.096=7.8575 +3.5=11.3575 +2.0245≈13.382.

Then, Im(f) =13.382/(2k ) →13.382/(2*0.2537 )≈13.382/(0.5074)≈26.36 fm.

But D is 251.271 fm, which is about ten times that. Hmm, perhaps I missed a factor.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula for Im(f) is sum ( (2l+1) sin δ_l ) / (k ).

Which would be 13.382 / 0.2537 ≈52.71 fm. Still not matching options.

Wait, let me check the options again.

Options:

A) 87163.4 fm

B) 355.351 fm

C) 177.675 fm

D) 251.271 fm

Hmm, 52.71 is not an option, but option B is 355, which is about 6.74 times 52.71.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k.

Wait, perhaps I should compute k in a different way. Let me compute it using the relativistic energy-momentum relation.

The energy E is given as 50 MeV.

The relativistic relation is E² = (pc)² + (m c²)^2.

So,

p c = sqrt( E² - (m c²)^2 )

= sqrt( (50)^2 - (0.511)^2 ) ≈ sqrt(2500 - 0.2611) ≈ sqrt(2499.7389) ≈49.99738879 MeV.

So,

p = (49.99738879 MeV )/(c )

So, the momentum p is 49.99738879 MeV/c.

The wave number k is given by k = p/(ħ )

But ħ c =197.327 MeV·fm.

So,

k = p/(ħ ) = (49.99738879 MeV/c ) / (197.327 MeV·fm ) * c/(ħ c )

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute:

k = p/(ħ ) → units: (MeV/c) / (MeV·fm ) → 1/(c fm )

But I'm getting confused again. Let me compute numerically.

p =49.99738879 MeV/c.

ħ =197.327 MeV·fm.

So,

k = p/(ħ ) → (49.99738879 MeV/c ) / (197.327 MeV·fm ) → (49.99738879 /197.327 ) (1/(c fm))

But 1/(c fm) is a unit of 1/(fm·m/s) → which is s/(fm·m) → not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute in terms of wavenumbers in 1/fm.

But I'm stuck on the correct way to compute k.

Wait, perhaps I should think of k as:

k = (p c ) / (ħ c² )

Wait, but that's getting too tangled.

Alternative approach: Let me compute the wavelength λ.

The de Broglie wavelength λ = h / p.

But h is Planck's constant, which is 2π ħ.

So,

λ = 2π ħ / p → k = 2π / λ = p/( ħ )

Wait, that makes sense. So,

k = p / ħ → 49.99738879 MeV/c / (197.327 MeV·fm )

= (49.99738879 / 197.327 ) (MeV/(c)) / (MeV·fm )

= (0.25369) (1/(c fm) )

But since c is in m/s, and 1 fm =1e-15 m, perhaps:

1/(c fm) = 1/( (3e8 m/s) * 1e-15 m ) ) → 1/(3e-7 m²/s )

Wait, this approach isn't helping. Maybe I should just proceed with k as 0.25369 fm⁻¹.

So, if Im(f)= sum (2l+1) sin δ_l / (2k )

Sum (2l+1) sin δ_l is 13.382.

So, 13.382/(2 *0.2537 )=13.382/(0.5074 )≈26.36 fm.

But none of the options match that.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is Im(f)= sum ( (2l+1) sin δ_l ) / (k )

Which would be 13.382 / 0.2537 ≈52.71 fm.

Still not matching the options.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the units again. The options are in the hundreds of fm, so perhaps I missed a factor of 1000.

Wait, no, because 0.2537 fm⁻¹ is 1/0.2537 fm ≈3.94 fm.

Alternatively, perhaps I made an error in the formula for the scattering amplitude's imaginary part.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula for the imaginary part is sum (2l+1) sin δ_l, without dividing by k.

But that would be 13.382 fm, but that's not matching any options.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is sum ( (2l+1) sin δ_l ) * something.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula for the imaginary part is ( sum (2l+1) sin δ_l ) * (ħ c )/(2 E )

But ħ c is 197.327 MeV·fm, E is 50 MeV.

So,

( sum (2l+1) sin δ_l ) * (197.327 MeV·fm )/(2 * 50 MeV ) )

= 13.382 * (197.327)/(100 )

=13.382 * 1.97327 ≈26.36 fm.

Still not matching.

Another possibility: perhaps the imaginary part is sum (2l+1) sin δ_l multiplied by something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the imaginary part as the sum of (2l+1) sin δ_l, and then multiply by 1/(k r ), where r is the impact parameter or something else. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude is given by (1/(k r )) * sum (2l+1) sin δ_l, but I'm not confident.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the optical theorem, which relates the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude to the total cross-section.

The optical theorem says that:

Im(f(0)) = (k/(4π)) σ_total.

But without knowing σ_total, this might not help directly.

Alternatively, perhaps the imaginary part is given by the sum of (2l+1) sin δ_l multiplied by something else involving k.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Let me think differently.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach and the correct formula for Im(f) is sum ( (2l+1) sin δ_l ) * (1/(2k )).

Which would be 13.382/(2*0.2537 )= 13.382 / 0.5074≈26.36 fm.

But again, the options don't have that.

Wait, the options are much larger. For example, option B is 355.351 fm. Which is about 13 times 26.36.

Hmm, 26.36 * 13 ≈342, which is near option B (355.35).

But why would there be a factor of 13?

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k.

Wait, earlier I approximated k as 0.2537 fm⁻¹, but perhaps that's incorrect.

Let me recompute k precisely.

We have:

k = sqrt( (E^2 - (m c^2)^2 ) ) / (ħ c )

E=50 MeV, m c^2=0.511 MeV.

So,

k = sqrt(50^2 - 0.511^2 ) / (197.327 )

= sqrt(2500 - 0.261121 ) /197.327

= sqrt(2499.738879 ) /197.327

=49.99738879 /197.327 ≈0.25369 fm⁻¹.

Hmm, same as before.

Wait, perhaps Im(f) is sum ( (2l+1) sin δ_l ) * (1/(k )).

So 13.382 /0.25369 ≈52.71 fm.

Which is still not matching any option.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is sum ( (2l+1) sin δ_l ) * (1/(2k )).

Which is 13.382/(2*0.25369 )= ~26.36 fm.

Again, no match.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the phase shifts given are for l=0 to4, but the sum should include all l from 0 to infinity. But the problem says to ignore the rest of the phase shifts, which I think means that higher l's are zero. So including l=0 to4 is correct.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a factor of 2π, because when I computed the sum, perhaps I should have multiplied by 2π.

Wait, but I don't recall any 2π factors in the formula for the scattering amplitude.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for the scattering amplitude is f = sum ( (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l P_l ) / (2ik r )

So that f is proportional to 1/r. But the question asks for the imaginary part along the incident beam direction, which would be for r approaching infinity, but perhaps the question is about the amplitude, not the potential.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think of a different approach.

Another thought: perhaps the problem is to compute the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude as given by the sum of (2l+1) sin δ_l, without any division by k.

So, the sum for l=0 to4 is 13.382 fm, which is still not among the options.

Wait, but the options are much larger, so perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Another approach: perhaps the formula for the scattering amplitude's imaginary part is sum ( (2l+1) sin δ_l ) * (1/(2k )) )

With sum=13.382, and k=0.2537 fm⁻¹.

So,

Im(f) =13.382/(2*0.2537 )=13.382/0.5074≈26.36 fm.

But the closest option is D) 251.271, which is about ten times that.

Hmm, 26.36 * 9.5 ≈250. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula includes a factor of (2π r), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the units of k. Let me think: perhaps I should compute k in the unit of 1/(fm), but I might have a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps to find k in 1/fm, using the correct formula.

Alternatively, the wave number k is given by:

k = (2π)/λ.

The wavelength λ for an electron is λ = h / p.

h is Planck's constant, 6.626e-34 J·s.

p, the momentum, is gamma * m v.

But for high energy electrons, E ≈ pc → p ≈ E/c.

E=50 MeV =50e6 eV.

Since 1 eV =1.602e-19 J,

So E=50e6 *1.602e-19 J=8.01e-13 J.

c=3e8 m/s.

So p = E/c = (8.01e-13 J )/(3e8 m/s )= 2.67e-21 kg·m/s.

Now, λ = h/p =6.626e-34 J·s / 2.67e-21 kg·m/s = 2.48e-13 m = 2.48e-13 m = 2480 fm.

So k =1/λ =1/(2480 fm )≈4.02e-4 fm⁻¹.

Wait, that's different from the earlier calculation of 0.2537 fm⁻¹.

Wait, wait, this can't be right because earlier calculation using relativistic energy gave k≈0.2537 fm⁻¹, but using lambda= h/p gives a much smaller k.

So I must be making a mistake here.

Wait, no, I think I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recompute p.

E=50 MeV =50e6 eV.

Each eV is 1.602e-19 J, so E=50e6 *1.602e-19 =8.01e-13 J.

Since E=pc → p=E/c → 8.01e-13 J / (3e8 m/s )= 2.67e-21 kg·m/s.

h=6.626e-34 J·s.

λ = h/p =6.626e-34 / 2.67e-21 → approximately 2.48e-13 m → 2.48e-13 m = 248e-15 m =248 fm.

So λ=248 fm → k=1/λ =1/(248 fm )≈ 0.00403 fm⁻¹.

But this is different from the earlier calculation of 0.2537 fm⁻¹.

Hmm, so which is correct?

Wait, earlier with the relativistic approach, I had k=0.2537 fm⁻¹, but with this approach, it's 0.00403 fm⁻¹.

That's a big discrepancy. I must have made a mistake.

Wait, I think the mistake is in the unit conversion for the relativistic approach.

Let me recompute k using the relativistic formula accurately.

E=50 MeV.

m c²=0.511 MeV.

So,

pc = sqrt( E^2 - (m c²)^2 ) = sqrt(50^2 -0.511^2 )=49.99738879 MeV.

So, p=49.99738879 MeV/c.

Now, in terms of kg·m/s.

1 MeV/c = (1.602e-13 J ) / (3e8 m/s ) = (1.602e-13 kg·m²/s² ) / (3e8 m/s ) ) =5.34e-22 kg·m/s.

So,

p=49.99738879 MeV/c *5.34e-22 kg·m/s per MeV/c ≈49.99738879 *5.34e-22 ≈2.67e-21 kg·m/s.

Same as earlier.

So, h/p =6.626e-34 /2.67e-21=2.48e-13 m → 248 fm.

So, k =1/lambda =1/(248 fm )= 4.03e-3 fm⁻¹.

But earlier calculation using the relativistic approach gave k=0.2537 fm⁻¹, which is much larger.

This suggests a mistake in the earlier approach.

Wait, the correct way to compute k is via the de Broglie wavelength.

Thus, k=1/lambda= (p hbar )/(hbar p )= p / hbar → which is consistent with the earlier approach.

Wait, wait, no: ħ = h/(2π ), so h=2π ħ.

So,

lambda = h/p = (2π ħ )/p → k = p/(ħ )

Which is the same as before.

So,

k= p/(ħ )

p=49.99738879 MeV/c → but to compute in kg·m/s, as before, p=2.67e-21 kg·m/s.

ħ=1.0545718e-34 J·s =1.0545718e-34 kg·m²/s.

So,

k= p/ħ =2.67e-21 /1.0545718e-34 ≈2.53e13 m⁻¹.

But 1 fm=1e-15 m, so 1 fm⁻¹=1e15 m⁻¹.

So,

k=2.53e13 m⁻¹=2.53e13 /1e15 fm⁻¹=0.0253 fm⁻¹.

So, k≈0.0253 fm⁻¹.

Wait, that's different from the earlier 0.2537 fm⁻¹.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in units earlier. So the correct value of k is approximately 0.0253 fm⁻¹.

So now, let's go back to the sum.

Using the formula where Im(f)= sum ( (2l+1) sin δ_l ) / (2k )

Sum=13.382, k=0.0253 fm⁻¹.

So,

Im(f)=13.382/(2 *0.0253 )=13.382/0.0506≈264.3 fm.

Which is close to option B) 355.351 fm and option C) 177.675.

Hmm, not quite matching, but perhaps I made a mistake in the sum.

Wait, let me recompute the sum.

Sum (2l+1) sin δ_l:

l=0: 1 * 1=1.

l=1:3 * sin(67)=3 *0.9205=2.7615.

l=2:5 * sin(55)=5 *0.8192=4.096.

l=3:7 * sin(30)=7 *0.5=3.5.

l=4:9 * sin(13)=9 *0.22495=2.02455.

Sum:1+2.7615=3.7615 +4.096=7.8575 +3.5=11.3575 +2.02455=13.38205.

So sum is 13.38205.

Using k=0.0253 fm⁻¹:

Im(f)=13.38205/(2*0.0253 )=13.38205/0.0506≈264.3 fm.

Which is close to option B (355.351) and option C (177.675).

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k.

Wait, perhaps I should compute k correctly.

With p=2.67e-21 kg·m/s.

ħ=1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So,

k = p / ħ =2.67e-21 /1.0545718e-34 ≈2.53e13 m⁻¹.

Convert m⁻¹ to fm⁻¹: 1 m⁻¹=1e15 fm⁻¹.

So,

k=2.53e13 m⁻¹ *1e15 fm =2.53e28 fm⁻¹.

Wait, that's not right. Wait, no: 1 m⁻¹ =1e15 fm⁻¹.

So,

k=2.53e13 m⁻¹ →2.53e13 *1e15 fm⁻¹ =2.53e28 fm⁻¹.

That's impossible. I must have made a mistake in the unit conversion.

Wait, no. 1 m⁻¹ is (1 m)^-1 = (1e15 fm )^-1 =1e-15 fm⁻¹.

Wait, no, wait. 1 m =1e15 fm.

So, 1 m⁻¹ = (1e15 fm )^-1 =1e-15 fm⁻¹.

So,

k=2.53e13 m⁻¹ =2.53e13 *1e-15 fm⁻¹ =2.53e-2 fm⁻¹ →0.0253 fm⁻¹.

Ah, so that's correct. So k=0.0253 fm⁻¹.

Thus, Im(f)=13.38205/(2*0.0253 )=13.38205/0.0506≈264.3 fm.

Which is not in the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is Im(f) = sum ( (2l+1) sin δ_l ) / k.

Which would be 13.38205 /0.0253 ≈528.6 fm.

Still not matching any option.

Wait, option B is 355.351 fm. Which is about half of 528.6.

Hmm, but why would that be.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is sum ( (2l+1) (1 - cos δ_l ) )

But I don't recall that.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the sum of (2l+1) sin δ_l and multiply by (ħ c )/(2 E )

Which would be 13.382 * (197.327 )/(2*50 ) →13.382 *1.97327≈26.36 fm.

Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the imaginary part as Im(f) = (sum (2l+1) sin δ_l ) * (ħ c )/(2 E )

Which would be 13.382 *197.327/(2*50 )=13.382 *1.97327≈26.36 fm.

Still not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is Im(f)= sum ( (2l+1) sin δ_l ) * (ħ c )/(E )

Which would be 13.382 *197.327/50 →13.382 *3.9465≈52.71 fm.

Hmm, again, not matching.

Another thought: perhaps the correct formula for the imaginary part is sum ( (2l+1) (1 - cos δ_l ) )

Wait, but that sum would be:

l=0:1*(1-0)=1.

l=1:3*(1 - cos67 )=3*(1-0.3907)=3*(0.6093)=1.8279.

l=2:5*(1 - cos55 )=5*(1-0.5736)=5*(0.4264)=2.132.

l=3:7*(1 - cos30 )=7*(1-0.8660)=7*(0.134 )=0.938.

l=4:9*(1 - cos13 )=9*(1-0.9744)=9*(0.0256)=0.2304.

Sum:1 +1.8279=2.8279 +2.132=4.9599 +0.938=5.8979 +0.2304≈6.1283.

So sum=6.1283.

But I don't know how this relates to the options.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the entire approach and the correct answer is option D) 251.271 fm.

But without knowing, I'll have to make an educated guess.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to compute Im(f) as sum ( (2l+1) sin δ_l ) * (1/(2k )).

With sum=13.382, k=0.0253 fm⁻¹.

So,

Im(f)=13.382/(2*0.0253 )=13.382/0.0506≈264.3 fm.

Which is close to option B (355) and option D (251).

But perhaps I made a mistake in the value of k.

Wait, perhaps I should compute k correctly.

Wait, let me compute k using the relation E = ħ c k.

E=50 MeV.

k=E/(ħ c )=50 /197.327≈0.25369 fm⁻¹.

Ah! So earlier mistake was in the calculation of k.

So,

k=50 /197.327 ≈0.2537 fm⁻¹.

So, Im(f)= sum ( (2l+1) sin δ_l ) / (2k )

=13.382/(2*0.2537 )=13.382/0.5074≈26.36 fm.

But the options don't have that. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is Im(f)= sum ( (2l+1) sin δ_l ) * (1/k )

Which would be 13.382/0.2537 ≈52.71 fm.

Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps the formula is sum ( (2l+1) sin δ_l ) * (k )

Which would be 13.382 *0.2537 ≈3.39 fm.

Still not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is sum ( (2l+1) sin δ_l ) * (2π/k )

Which would be 13.382 * (2π /0.2537 )≈13.382 *24.99≈334 fm.

Close to option B (355.351) and option D (251.271).

Hmm, 334 is closest to option B, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the sum (2l+1) sin δ_l and multiply by 2π/k.

But without knowing the correct formula, it's hard to proceed.

Given the time I've spent, perhaps the correct answer is option C)177.675 fm.

But I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D) 251.271 fm.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the sum (2l+1) sin δ_l and multiply by (2π/k )

Which would be 13.382 * (2 *3.1416 ) /0.2537 →13.382 *24.99 ≈334 fm.

Which is near option B (355.351).

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D) 251.271 fm.

But I'm stuck.

After all this, I'll have to make a guess. Since the sum of (2l+1) sin δ_l is 13.382, and when multiplied by k=0.2537, it's about 3.39 fm. Not matching any option.

Wait, maybe I should think about the units again.

Wait, the options are in the order of hundreds of fm, which suggests that perhaps the formula for Im(f) is sum ( (2l+1) sin δ_l ) * (ħ c )/(2 E )

Which would be 13.382 * (197.327 )/(2*50 ) →13.382 *1.97327≈26.36 fm.

Still not.

Alternatively, perhaps it's sum ( (2l+1) sin δ_l ) * (ħ c )/( E )

Which would be 13.382 *3.9465≈52.71 fm.

Still not.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is Im(f)= (sum (2l+1) sin δ_l ) * (ħ c )/(2 E )

Which is 13.382 *197.327/(2*50 )=13.382 *1.97327≈26.36 fm.

Hmm.

Another approach: Perhaps the imaginary part is (sum (2l+1) sin δ_l ) * (ħ c )/(E )

Which is 13.382 * (197.327 )/50 ≈13.382 *3.9465≈52.71 fm.

Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is Im(f)= (sum (2l+1) sin δ_l ) * (ħ c )/( E )

Which would be 13.382 *197.327/50 →13.382 *3.9465≈52.71 fm.

But options are much larger.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the formula for Im(f) is sum ( (2l+1) sin δ_l ) * (2π )/(k )

Which would be 13.382 * (2 *3.1416 )/0.2537 →13.382 *24.99≈334 fm.

Close to option B (355.351).

So perhaps the correct answer is option B) 355.351 fm.

But I'm not certain.


To calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction, we use the partial wave expansion for elastic scattering. The scattering amplitude \( f(k, \theta, \phi) \) is expressed as:

\[
f(k, \theta, \phi) = \frac{1}{2ik} \sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l+1) e^{i\delta_l} \sin\delta_l P_l(\cos\theta),
\]

where \( P_l(\cos\theta) \) are the Legendre polynomials. Along the incident beam direction (\( \theta = 0 \)), \( P_l(1) = 1 \) for all \( l \), simplifying the expression to:

\[
f(k, 0, \phi) = \frac{1}{2ik} \sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l+1) e^{i\delta_l} \sin\delta_l.
\]

The imaginary part of \( f \) is extracted by considering the imaginary component of the sum. Expanding \( e^{i\delta_l} \sin\delta_l \) as:

\[
e^{i\delta_l} \sin\delta_l = \sin\delta_l (\cos\delta_l + i\sin\delta_l) = \sin\delta_l \cos\delta_l + i \sin^2\delta_l,
\]

the imaginary part of \( f \) is proportional to:

\[
\text{Im}(f) = \frac{1}{2k} \sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l+1) \sin^2\delta_l.
\]

### Step 1: Compute \( \sum (2l+1) \sin^2\delta_l \)
Given the phase shifts \( \delta_0 = 90^\circ, \delta_1 = 67^\circ, \delta_2 = 55^\circ, \delta_3 = 30^\circ, \delta_4 = 13^\circ \), we calculate \( \sin^2\delta_l \) for each \( l \) and sum the terms:

- \( l = 0 \): \( (2l+1) = 1, \sin^2(90^\circ) = 1 \), contribution = \( 1 \cdot 1 = 1 \).
- \( l = 1 \): \( (2l+1) = 3, \sin^2(67^\circ) \approx 0.9205^2 \approx 0.8473 \), contribution = \( 3 \cdot 0.8473 \approx 2.5419 \).
- \( l = 2 \): \( (2l+1) = 5, \sin^2(55^\circ) \approx 0.8192^2 \approx 0.6711 \), contribution = \( 5 \cdot 0.6711 \approx 3.3555 \).
- \( l = 3 \): \( (2l+1) = 7, \sin^2(30^\circ) = 0.5^2 = 0.25 \), contribution = \( 7 \cdot 0.25 = 1.75 \).
- \( l = 4 \): \( (2l+1) = 9, \sin^2(13^\circ) \approx 0.22495^2 \approx 0.0506 \), contribution = \( 9 \cdot 0.0506 \approx 0.4554 \).

Summing these contributions:

\[
\sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1) \sin^2\delta_l \approx 1 + 2.5419 + 3.3555 + 1.75 + 0.4554 \approx 9.1028.
\]

### Step 2: Compute \( k \)
The wave number \( k \) is related to the energy \( E \) of the electrons by:

\[
k = \frac{\sqrt{E^2 - m^2c^4}}{\hbar c},
\]

where \( E = 50 \, \text{MeV} \), \( m c^2 = 0.511 \, \text{MeV} \), and \( \hbar c = 197.327 \, \text{MeV·fm} \). Substituting:

\[
k = \frac{\sqrt{50^2 - 0.511^2}}{197.327} \approx \frac{\sqrt{2500 - 0.261}}{197.327} \approx \frac{49.9974}{197.327} \approx 0.2537 \, \text{fm}^{-1}.
\]

### Step 3: Compute \( \text{Im}(f) \)
Using the formula for \( \text{Im}(f) \):

\[
\text{Im}(f) = \frac{1}{2k} \sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1) \sin^2\delta_l,
\]

substitute \( \sum (2l+1) \sin^2\delta_l \approx 9.1028 \) and \( k \approx 0.2537 \, \text{fm}^{-1} \):

\[
\text{Im}(f) = \frac{9.1028}{2 \cdot 0.2537} \approx \frac{9.1028}{0.5074} \approx 17.94 \, \text{fm}.
\]

### Step 4: Match with Options
The computed value of \( \text{Im}(f) \approx 17.94 \, \text{fm} \) does not match any of the given options directly. However, the closest option is **C) 177.675 fm**, which is approximately 10 times larger. This discrepancy suggests a possible missing factor of 10 in the calculation or interpretation of the problem.

### Final Answer:
Based on the reasoning and calculations, the most reasonable choice is:

**Answer: C**
