Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to break it down step by step. Hmm, let's see what the question is about.

So, the problem starts with Compound A. Its proton NMR shows two signals. One is a triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H, and another is a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. I remember that in NMR, the splitting tells us about neighboring protons. A triplet usually means each proton is next to two others, so maybe something like a CH2 group next to another CH2. The quartet would mean each proton is next to three others, which could be a CH2 next to a CH3.

Wait, let me think. The triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H suggests maybe two equivalent CH3 groups. Because each CH3 has three H, two would be six. The quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H could be two CH2 groups. So maybe the structure is something like (CH3)2CHCH2CH2CH2CH3? Wait, no. Wait, the quartet would be the CH2 next to something else. Let me think again.

Wait, for a triplet at 0.9, that's two sets of three H, so each is a CH3. The quartet is 4H, maybe a CH2 that's next to a CH2, which would split into a quartet because each of its Hs has three neighbors from the adjacent CH2. Hmm, perhaps the structure is something like (CH3)2CHCH2CH2CH3? No, that doesn't add up because the quartet would be for a CH2 adjacent to another CH2.

Wait, maybe it's a diethyl group? Like ethyl groups. Let me think: The triplet comes from the CH3 groups in an ethyl chain. Each ethyl group has two CH3s. So if the structure is CH2CH2(C... something), no, wait. Let me think of neopentane or something else.

Alternatively, think about the splitting. If the triplet is 6H, that's two CH3 groups. They are each next to a CH2. So like CH2CH3 next to another CH2. So maybe the structure is (CH3)2CHCH2CH2CH2CH3? No, that's 2-ethylpentane or something. Wait, let me count the Hs. So the triplet would be from the CH2 that's next to two CH3s? Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, maybe it's a diethyl group attached to something else. Like, maybe the compound is diethyl something. For example, diethyl ether? No, because diethyl ether would have more complex splitting. Or maybe it's a compound with two ethyl groups attached to a central atom, like O or another carbon. But in the case of NMR, in diethyl ether, the CH2CH3 groups would have specific splitting.

Alternatively, maybe it's cyclopropane or something else. Wait, maybe it's a cyclohexane derivative. Alternatively, perhaps it's more about the monobromination.

Wait, the first step is that compound A undergoes monobromination to form B. Then B reacts with alcoholic KOH to form C. Since alcoholic KOH is
