Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the structure of product 4. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll take it slow.

The starting material is 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. Hmm, let me visualize that. The cyclohexanone ring has a hydroxymethyl group at position 3 and a prop-1-en-2-yl group at position 5. Prop-1-en-2-yl is an allyl group, right? So like CH2=C(CH3)-. Wait, no, wait. Prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2-CH(CH2?), wait, no. Wait, prop-1-en-2-yl would be CH2=C(CH2)? No, wait, no. Let me think. Propene is CH2=CHCH3. So prop-1-en-2-yl would be the substituent where the double bond is between C1 and C2. So it's CH2=CH- attached to something, but the substituent is at position 2. Wait, perhaps it's (CH2)CH2 with a double bond. Maybe I should draw it. Alternatively, perhaps it's the same as isopropenyl group. Wait, prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2=C(CH2-), but that doesn't make much sense. Wait, another way: the structure would be CH2=CH-CH2- attached to the ring, but wait no. Wait, no, wait. The substituent is prop-1-en-2-yl, which is (CH2)2C- with a double bond. Maybe it's better to think of it as a cyclopropane-like substituent. Wait, no. Let me think again. The substituent is on the cyclohexanone ring in position 5. So the structure is a cyclohexanone ring with a ketone at position 1. Position 3 has a hydroxymethyl (CH2OH), and position 5 has a prop-1-en-2-yl group. So prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2-C(CH3)=. Wait, no, I think I'm getting confused. Let me look up the structure. Oh,
