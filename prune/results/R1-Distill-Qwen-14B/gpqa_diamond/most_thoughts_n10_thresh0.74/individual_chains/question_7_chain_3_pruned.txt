Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The question is about the annihilation of high-energy gamma rays with photons from the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). The process is gamma-gamma annihilation producing electron-positron pairs, like γγ→e+e−. The question is asking at what energy the gamma-rays' lifetime in the universe is limited by this process. The average photon energy of the CMB is given as 10^-3 eV.

Hmm, so I remember that when high-energy particles interact with the CMB, their mean lifetime can be limited by processes like this. The lifetime is determined by the probability of the interaction happening multiplied by the age of the universe, I think. So the idea is that if the interaction probability is high enough, the gamma-rays won't survive for the age of the universe, effectively limiting their lifetime.

I think the formula for the interaction rate involves the cross-section and the density of the target photons. The cross-section is a measure of the probability of the interaction happening. The higher the cross-section, the more likely the interaction, so the shorter the mean lifetime.

Wait, the mean lifetime τ is inversely proportional to the interaction rate Γ. So τ = 1/Γ. And Γ is the product of the cross-section σ and the photon density n.

So, Γ = σ * n * v, but wait, v is the relative velocity of the gamma and CMB photon. But since the CMB is isotropic and the gamma is moving through it, maybe we can approximate v as the speed of light, but perhaps it's already accounted for in the cross-section formula.

Alternatively, maybe the cross-section is given in a way that includes the velocity factors, so perhaps I don't need to worry about v separately.

The cross-section for γγ → e+e−. I'm not exactly sure about the exact expression, but I think it's proportional to 1/(s), where s is the square of the center-of-mass energy. Or maybe it's a function of s. Wait, for pair production via two-photon collisions, the cross-section typically depends on the energy. I remember that the cross-section for this process peaks around certain energies, but I'm not too clear on the exact dependence.

Alternatively, maybe I should think about the threshold condition for this reaction. The center-of-mass energy must be at least 2m_e c^2, where m_e is the electron mass. So s ≥ (2m_e c²)². But since the gamma rays are high-energy, perhaps this condition is already satisfied, so the cross-section is non-zero.

Wait, but to calculate the cross-section, I think it's proportional to 1/s. Or is it something else? Let me think. I remember that for photon-photon interactions, the cross-section for pair production is given by σ ≈ (8π/3) * (α^2 / m_e^2) * (1/s), where α is the fine-structure constant. So σ ∝ 1/s.

But wait, I'm not 100% sure. Another approach: the cross-section for γγ → e+e− is given by the formula σ = (8π/3) (α² / s), where s = (k1 + k2)² is the Mandelstam variable. So s is the square of the sum of the momenta of the two photons in the center-of-mass frame.

Wait, but in the lab frame, where the CMB is at rest and the gamma is moving, we can calculate s as follows. Each photon has energy E1 and E2. For the CMB photons, E2 is roughly the average energy, which is 1e-3 eV. The gamma photon has energy E1, which is much higher.

In the center-of-mass frame, s = (E1 + E2)^2 (since both are moving in opposite directions in the lab frame, their momenta vectors are opposite, so their sum is E1 + E2 when considering the magnitude). But wait, for photons, the energy is equal to the magnitude of the momentum times c, since E = |p| c. So for two photons moving in opposite directions, their momenta vectors are opposite, so the total momentum is (p1 - p2) if they're moving head-on. But when calculating s, which is (p1 + p2)^2, but wait, if they're moving in opposite directions, is their total momentum p1 + p2 or p1 - p2?

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let's think about it in terms of four-momentum. Each photon's four-momentum is (E, pc_x, pc_y, pc_z). For a photon moving in the +z direction, p = (E, 0, 0, E/c). For another photon moving in the -z direction, p = (E', 0, 0, -E'/c).

So the sum of the four-momenta is (E + E', 0, 0, (E/c - E'/c)). The square of this four-vector is (E + E')² - (E - E')² c² / c². Since c² is 1 in these units (if we're using natural units), then s = (E + E')² - (E - E')² = [E² + 2 E E' + E'^2] - [E² - 2 E E' + E'^2] = 4 E E'.

So s = 4 E1 E2, where E1 is the gamma energy and E2 is the CMB photon energy. So s is 4 E1 E2.

So the cross-section is σ = (8π/3) (α² / (s)) ) → since s=4 E1 E2, so σ = (8π/3) (α²) / (4 E1 E2) ) = (2π α²) / (3 E1 E2).

Wait, let me make sure. Alternatively, I've heard that the cross-section for pair production by two photons is σ ≈ 6.8 × 10^-25 cm² (E/(100 MeV))^{-1}, but that might be a simplified version. Hmm, maybe the exact formula isn't crucial as long as I can express the cross-section in terms of the energies.

But perhaps I should proceed with the formula I have. So σ = (8π/3) (α² / s) ) = (8 π α^2) / (4 E1 E2) ) = (2 π α^2) / ( E1 E2 ).

Wait, let me compute the numbers. But maybe I can work symbolically for now.

So the interaction rate Γ is the product of the cross-section σ and the photon density n multiplied by the relative velocity v. But since these are photons, and they're moving at the speed of light, but the gamma photon is moving much faster than the CMB photons (since it's high energy), so perhaps the relative velocity v is approximately c. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, the photon density n is given by the number density of CMB photons.

The number density of CMB photons can be calculated using the formula for a blackbody spectrum. The average photon energy is given as 1e-3 eV, but for a blackbody, the number density n is related to the temperature.

Wait, the CMB temperature is about 2.7 K. Let me calculate the number density. The number density n is given by n = (g * U)/(k_B T), where g is the number of degrees of freedom per photon (for a photon gas, g=2 for polarization). Wait, no, the energy density U for a photon gas is U = a T^4, where a is the radiation constant. The number density is n = (4 U)/(k_B T) ), because the average energy per photon is U/n = (3/2) k_B T, but wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the photon number density formula.

Actually, the number density of photons n in a blackbody at temperature T is n = (2 g * U )/(k_B T), where g is the degeneracy factor (for photons, g=2 since two polarizations). Wait, perhaps it's better to use the formula n = (8 π a / (k_B T)) ) * (something), but maybe I can recall that the number density of CMB photons is about 411 photons per cm³, which is roughly 4e8 m^-3. Wait, that's because the CMB has a temperature of about 2.7 K, so using the formula n = (2.725e23 photons/cm³) * (T/K)^3. So T=2.7 K, n ≈ 2.725e23 * (2.7)^3 ≈ 2.725e23 * 20 ≈ 5.45e24 photons/cm³, which is 5.45e8 m^-3 (since 1 cm³ is 1e-6 m³). Wait, that's 5.45e8 per m³? Hmm, but I think I might have made a mistake in the exponent. Let me double-check.

Wait, no, the number density n is given by n = (2.725e23 cm^-3) * (T/K)^3. So for T=2.7 K, n ≈ 2.725e23 * (2.7)^3 ≈ 2.725e23 * 20. So that's about 5.45e24 cm^-3. Wait, but cm^-3 is 1e6 m^-3, so 5.45e24 cm^-3 = 5.45e24 * 1e6 m^-3 → wait no, wait 1 cm^3 is 1e-6 m³. So 1 cm^-3 is 1e6 m^-3. So 5.45e24 cm^-3 = 5.45e24 * 1e6 m^-3 = 5.45e30 m^-3. That seems high, but I think that's correct.

Wait, but maybe I should double-check. The standard number density for CMB is indeed about ~411 photons per cubic centimeter, which is 411 cm^-3. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no, wait, the CMB photon density is about 411 photons per cubic centimeter at present. So 411 cm^-3 = 411e6 m^-3 (since 1 cm = 0.01 m, so 1 cm³ = 1e-6 m³; so 1 cm^-3 = 1e6 m^-3). So 411 cm^-3 = 4.11e8 m^-3. Hmm, that's a big difference. So which is correct?

I think I confused the formula. The formula I recall is n_γ ≈ 0.71 × 10^8 (T/1 K)^3 cm^-3. So for T=2.7 K, n_γ ≈ 0.71e8 * (2.7)^3 ≈ 0.71e8 * 20 ≈ 1.42e9 cm^-3. So that's 1.42e9 photons per cm³, which is 1.42e15 m^-3 (since 1 cm³ = 1e-6 m³ → 1 cm^-3 = 1e6 m^-3, so 1.42e9 cm^-3 = 1.42e9 * 1e6 m^-3 = 1.42e15 m^-3).

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me compute it correctly.

The number density of photons in the CMB is given by n_γ = (2ζ(3)/π) * (2π m_e k_B T)^{3/2} } / (h^3) ), where ζ(3) is the Riemann zeta function at 3, approximately 1.202.

Alternatively, another formula I've seen is n_γ =
