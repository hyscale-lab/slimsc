Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about high-energy gamma-rays annihilating with CMB photons to produce electron-positron pairs. Hmm, I remember that the CMB is the afterglow of the Big Bang, and its photons have really low energy. The question is asking about the energy of gamma-rays whose lifetime in the universe is limited by this annihilation process.

Wait, right, the average photon energy of the CMB is given as 1e-3 eV. So each CMB photon is about 1e-3 eV. Gamma-rays are high energy; they're interacting with these low-energy CMB photons.

The reaction is gamma + gamma → e+ + e-. So for this to happen, the energy has to be enough to create the electron and positron. Each has a rest mass of about 0.511 MeV, so the total rest mass energy is 1.022 MeV. But wait, in particle physics, when two particles collide, the center-of-mass energy needs to be at least the sum of the rest masses. So the combined energy of the gamma and CMB photon needs to be at least 2 * 0.511 MeV, which is 1.022 MeV. But since the CMB photon has such low energy, the gamma must be the high-energy one.

Wait, but how does this relate to the energy of the gamma-ray? Let's think in terms of the threshold energy for pair production. The condition for pair production to occur is that the center-of-mass energy (sqrt(s)) must be at least 2m_e c². So sqrt(s) ≥ 2m_e c². 

But what's the energy of the gamma in this scenario? The CMB photons are the low-energy ones. So perhaps I should use the relation for the threshold condition. Let me recall that in the rest frame of one photon, the other photon's energy must be sufficient to create the pair. Alternatively, maybe I should use the formula for photon-photon collisions.

The energy in the center-of-mass frame is given by sqrt( (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c + p2 c)^2 ), but since photons are massless, their momentum is E/c. So in the case where one photon is much more energetic than the other (gamma >> E_cmb), maybe we can approximate the threshold condition.

Wait, the threshold condition for photon-photon pair production
