Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. Let me see what it's about. Hmm, it's about meson resonance and calculating the mean decay distance. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to remember.

The question gives some specific numbers: production energy E_X is 8 GeV, mass m_X is 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X is 320 MeV. And we're supposed to find the mean decay distance from the options provided.

Wait, mesons are subatomic particles, right? And resonance in this context probably refers to the particle being a resonance state, meaning it's unstable and decays quickly. So decay distance would be how far the meson travels before it decays.

I think the mean decay distance depends on the lifetime of the particle. The formula I remember is something like decay distance L = c * τ, where c is the speed of light and τ is the mean lifetime. But wait, how do I find τ given these parameters?

Oh right, the mean lifetime τ is related to the width Γ. The formula is τ = ħ / Γ. But wait, ħ (h-bar) is the reduced Planck constant. I should make sure to get the units right here.

Wait, but wait—another thing comes to mind. I think when a particle is produced, its energy and mass relate to the decay width. Also, the decay width Γ is connected to the lifetime by Γ = ħ / τ. So, τ = ħ
