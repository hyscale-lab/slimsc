Okay, so I have this question about exoplanets and their densities. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on my planetary science, but I'll give it a shot.

The question is asking which exoplanet has the highest density. There are four options: a, b, c, d, and the choices are labeled A to D.

First, I need to understand what each option is saying. Let me read them again.

Option a: An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet. So same as Earth in both mass and radius. Earth's density is known, right? Approximately 5.5 g/cm³. So this planet should have the same density as Earth.

Option b: A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of about 5.5 g/cm³. Wait, the density is given here. So this is a planet twice as massive as Earth, but with the same density. Since density is mass/volume, if mass doubles but density stays the same, volume must be double as well. So the radius would be larger, but maybe the question isn't about radius, just density. But in this case, the answer is given as 5.5, same as Earth. So maybe that's not the highest.

Option c: A planet with same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive. Hmm. Since it's the same composition, same density? Wait, no. Wait, the density depends on mass and radius. If a planet is more massive, but same composition, how does that affect density? Let me think. For a planet with same composition, I think the density would be the same because density is a material property. So if it's made of same stuff (like Earth), whether it's bigger or smaller, the density remains the same. Wait, but wait, maybe when you have a larger planet, the density could change because of different internal pressures? I'm not so sure. Maybe for Earth-like planets, if their mass increases, the radius increases, but the density remains roughly the same. So for example, if Earth's mass increases 5 times, assuming same composition, the radius would increase, but the density (mass/volume) would stay about the same as Earth's. So this planet would have same density as Earth, around 5.5 g/cm³.

Option d: Same composition as Earth but half the mass. Similar to option c, but smaller. If it's same composition, same density. So same 5.5 g/cm³.

Wait, but wait, I might be getting confused here. Let me think again. Let's consider the formula for density. Density = mass / volume. Volume depends on radius, since Volume = (4/3)πr³. So if the planet has the same composition as Earth, which I think implies same average density. So regardless of the size, as long as the composition is the same, the density is same. So if Earth is 5.5, any Earth-like planet with same composition (like options c and d) should have the same density.

Wait, but that's not necessarily true. Wait, Earth's density is determined by its composition and the way mass is distributed. If you have a planet with same composition but different mass, maybe the density changes? Hmm. Or does it stay the same? Because for Earth, the density comes from the materials it's made of. If
