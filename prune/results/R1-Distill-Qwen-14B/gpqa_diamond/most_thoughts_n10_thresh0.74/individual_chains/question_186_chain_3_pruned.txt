Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about the Cope rearrangement. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. The compound given is (1S,4R)-2-vinyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene. I remember that Cope rearrangement involves 1,5-dienes rearranging into another diene structure, typically forming a cyclic transition state. 

Wait, but wait. The Cope rearrangement is a [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement, right? So the molecule must have a 1,5-diene system. Let me look at the structure. The molecule is a bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene with a vinyl group on carbon 2 and an azabicyclo structure.

Bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene means it has two rings: a bridge structure with two carbons in each bridge. The substituents are at positions 1 and 4, which are on the bridgeheads. The 2-vinyl group is on one of the bridgeheads, and the double bond is at position 5. 

Wait, the structure of 2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene. So, the nitrogen is at position 2. Let me think. The bicyclo structure would have bridges of two carbons each. So, imagine a norbornene structure. Norbornene is bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene. But this is hept-5-ene, so the double bond is in a different position.

But wait, the substituent is a vinyl group on carbon 2. So, the structure has a bridge, and on the bridgehead (position 2), there's a vinyl group (CH2-CH2? No, wait, vinyl is CH2=CH-. So it's attached to the bridgehead.

I think the molecule is something like this: the bicyclo has a bridge, and at position 2, which is a bridgehead, there's a vinyl group, so CH2=CH- attached.

Now, for the Cope rearrangement, the molecule must have two double bonds or a diene in the correct position. Wait, no, the Cope rearrangement requires a 1,5-diene. So two double bonds that are conjugated, but in
