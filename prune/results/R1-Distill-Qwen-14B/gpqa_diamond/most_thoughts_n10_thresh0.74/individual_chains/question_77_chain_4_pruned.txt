Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem about the Cope rearrangement. Hmm, I remember that the Cope rearrangement involves 1,5-dienes. The reaction usually occurs under heat or light, right? The question gives two different reactions, A and B, and I need to determine the major products from each.

Let me first look at the first part, reaction A. The starting material is ((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene. So, that's a benzene ring with a substituent. The substituent is an oxy group (O) connected to a methyl group, and that methyl is connected to a 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl group. Wait, maybe I should draw that structure to get a clearer picture.

The structure would be benzene-O-CH2-C(CH2CH3)=CH2. Wait, no, let me think again. The substituent is (3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl. So, the butenyl group is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2? Wait, but it's but-2-en-1-yl. So the double bond is between C2 and C3. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH2CH3)-... No, wait, buten-1-yl would have the substituent starting from the first carbon. Let's see: but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2CH2? No, wait, but-2-en-1-yl is CH2-CH2-CH=CH2? No, wait. No, but-2-en-1-yl would be CH2=CHCH2- attached at the first carbon. Wait, but that would be CH2=CHCH2-CH2-... Wait, no. Let me count the carbons. But-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2CH2-? No, butenyl is four carbons. So but-2-en-1-yl would be CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-? No, but wait, that's if it's but-1-en-1-yl? I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, maybe it's CH2=CH-CH(CH2CH
