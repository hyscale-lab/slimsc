Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here. It's a reaction scheme, and I need to figure out what compound E is. Let me start by breaking down the problem step by step.

The question gives me a series of reactions starting from compound A and ending with E. There are also some hints provided, which I should definitely pay attention to.

First, the reaction steps:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to form compound B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 in the presence of Pd to form compound C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 (nitrous acid) to form compound D.
4. Compound D undergoes elimination of an inert gas to form compound E.

The hints given are:

a) Compound A, when reacted with an unknown phosphorous ylide, forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane.

b) The IR spectrum of compound A shows a strong peak around 1750 cm^-1, while compound E's IR is around 1715 cm^-1.

Looking at the IR data, compound A has a strong peak at 1750, which suggests a carbonyl group. But wait, 1750 is quite high, so maybe it's an ester, ketone, or maybe a nitrile? Or perhaps an aldehyde? Hmm. Wait, in the reaction, A reacts with HCN to form B. So A must be something that can react with HCN. 

HCN typically adds to carbonyl groups. So if A reacts with HCN, maybe A is a ketone or aldehyde. But then B would be a cyanohydrin. Alternatively, if A is an ester, HCN could add to it, but I'm not sure about that. Let's think more.

Wait, the first reaction is A + HCN â†’ B. So if A is a ketone, then B would be a cyanohydrin. Then B, when reduced with H2 and Pd, becomes compound C. Pd and H2 usually hydrogenate triple bonds or double bonds. So if B has a triple bond (like a nitrile group), then reduction would add H2 across it, turning the nitrile into an amine? No, wait, nitrile reduction usually gives a primary amine. But wait, when you hydrogenate a nitrile with H2 and a catalyst like Pd, it becomes an amine. So if B has a nitrile group, C would be an amine.

But then, looking at the next step: compound C reacts with HNO2 to form D. HNO2 is typically used to form diazonium salts, but that's with aromatic amines. However, in aliphatic amines, especially primary aliphatic amines, HNO2 can lead to the formation of diazonium salts which then undergo various reactions, like elimination to form nitro compounds or other structures. Alternatively, in some cases, it can lead to the formation of isocyanates or other intermediates, but I'm a bit unsure.

Another possibility is that compound C is a secondary amine. Wait
