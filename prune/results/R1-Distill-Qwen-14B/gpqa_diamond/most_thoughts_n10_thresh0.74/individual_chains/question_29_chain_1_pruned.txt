Okay, so I have this genetics problem to solve. Let me read it carefully and think through what's going on. 

The question is about a drought-resistant barley cultivar that has an anti-nutritional compound. They found the gene responsible for this compound and it has five exons and four introns. They used EMS mutagenesis to create mutants and are looking at the target gene sequences. 

The task is to determine which mutation would eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. So, I think this has to do with the gene product—maybe the gene encodes an enzyme that produces the compound. If we disrupt the gene, the enzyme won't be made, and thus the compound won't be synthesized.

Looking at the mutants, each has a change in the first exon. So the mutations are in the first exon area. Exons are coding regions, so any mutation here could affect the protein product.

The intact gene is provided, and the four mutants each have a different change. I need to compare each mutant's sequence to the intact one to see what kind of mutations they have and how that might affect the protein.

Let me write down the sequences to see the differences:

Intact: 5'-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3'

Mutant 1: 5'-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3'

Hmm, I'll compare each position. Let's see:

Looking at the first part of the sequence. Intact starts with ATGTTT. Mutant 1 has ATGTTCT. Wait, perhaps I should line them up.

Wait, perhaps I should look for where the changes occur. Let me break down the first part.

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CATA TTT ATT GTC GT...

Mutant 1: ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CATA TTT ATT GTC GC...

So, looking at the first few codons:

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT...

Mutant 1: ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT...

So, in the third codon: Intact has CTC (Leucine), Mutant 1 has TAC (Tyrosine). Then the next codon is GCT in both. Wait, no. Wait, maybe let me index the sequences.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to look for where the differences are.

Looking at each mutant:

Mutant 1:

- The first part: ATGTTCTACGCT... 
Intact: ATGTTTCTCGCT...

So, the third codon in intact is CTC (Leu), and in Mutant1, it's TAC (Tyr). Then the fourth codon in intact is GCT (Ala), and in Mutant1, it's GCT as well. Wait, no—maybe I need to look at the exact nucleotide changes.

Wait, maybe I should compare the sequences.

Intact: positions 1-20: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CATA TTT ATT GTC GT...

Mutant1: ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CATA TTT ATT GTC GC...

So, position 3: Intact has TTT (coding for Phe), Mutant1 has TTC (also Phe, same amino acid). Wait, but wait, the third codon is TTT in Intact, which is Phe, but in Mutant1, it's TTC, which is also Phe. Oh, wait, but maybe that's not the main change. Let me look further.

Wait, the third codon may not be where the change is. Maybe I'm misaligning. Let me think.

Wait, the intact gene is 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…
