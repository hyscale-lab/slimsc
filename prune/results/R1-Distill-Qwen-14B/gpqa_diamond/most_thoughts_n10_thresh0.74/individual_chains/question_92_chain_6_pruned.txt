Okay, so I've got this problem here about calculating the enthalpy of formation of a specific organic compound. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The compound given is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. Wow, that's a mouthful. I think I should draw the structure to visualize it better. Wait, but maybe I don't need to draw it. Let me just count the number of each type of bond because enthalpy of formation is usually calculated using bond energies.

Wait, no, the question gives me bond energies for different bonds, so I should calculate the enthalpy of formation using those. But wait, the question is about the enthalpy of formation, which is usually the change in enthalpy when one mole of a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states.

Wait, but the given data includes the enthalpy of atomization of carbon as 1000 kJ/mol. Oh right, enthalpy of atomization is the energy required to break a molecule into its constituent atoms. So for carbon, that's breaking C into C atoms.

So, to find the enthalpy of formation, I think I need to calculate the energy required to break all the bonds in the compound and then subtract the energy released when forming the bonds in the molecule. Or wait, no, maybe it's the other way around.

Wait, the enthalpy of formation is calculated by subtracting the sum of the bond energies of the reactants (elements) from the
