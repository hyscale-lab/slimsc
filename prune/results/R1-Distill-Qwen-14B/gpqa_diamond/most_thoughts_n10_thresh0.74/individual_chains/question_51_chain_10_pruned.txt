Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty on my electrostatics, but let's try to work through it. The question is about the potential energy of a system involving a charge and a grounded conducting sphere. Hmm, I remember that when dealing with conductors and charges, the method of images might come into play, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think.

The setup: there's a charge q placed at a distance d away from the center of a grounded conducting sphere with radius R. We need to find the net potential energy of this system. The options are A, B, C, D, each with different expressions.

Wait, potential energy in electrostatics usually involves the work done to assemble the charges. Since the sphere is conducting and grounded, any excess charge would reside on its surface. But since it's grounded, I think the sphere's potential is zero. Oh right, because grounding means it's connected to the Earth, so its potential is considered to be zero.

Now, when I place a charge q near the sphere, the sphere's surface will induce some charges. But because the sphere is conducting, the induced charges will arrange themselves such that the electric field inside the conductor is zero. Oh wait, but the sphere is grounded, so any induced charge would flow to the ground, right? So the sphere remains neutral? Or does it get induced charges that stay on it? Hmm, wait, no, for a conducting sphere, when you bring a charge near it, the charges on the sphere redistribute. But since it's grounded, the induced charges can leave the sphere, so the sphere remains neutral overall.

Wait, no, that's not right. Let me clarify. For a
