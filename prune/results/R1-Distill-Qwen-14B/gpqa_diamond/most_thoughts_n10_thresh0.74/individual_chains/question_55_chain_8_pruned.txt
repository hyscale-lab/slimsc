Okay, so I've got this NMR problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about identifying an unknown organic compound from its 1H NMR data. The options are between cis and trans versions of propenyl and butenyl acetates.

First, I need to look at the NMR data given. Let me list out the signals:

- 7.0 ppm: 1H, doublet, coupling constant J = 16.0 Hz.
- 5.5 ppm: 1H, doublet of quadruplets (dq).
- 2.1 ppm: 3H, singlet.
- 1.6 ppm: 3H, doublet.

Hmm. Let's think about what each of these signals could correspond to.

The singlet at 2.1 ppm is probably the acetyl group's methyl (OAc), since that's typical for acetates. The 3H singlet makes sense because there's no splitting—so no neighboring protons.

Now, the two doublets. Let's consider the protons on a double bond. Acetates with propenyl or butenyl groups would have double bonds.

If it's a propenyl group, like CH2=CHCH2-OAc or something, but wait, wait. Wait, wait. Wait, but the butenyl would have a longer chain. Let me think about the structures.

Wait, for example, propenyl acetate would be something like CH2=CHCH2-OAc. But wait, wait—no, wait, the propenyl group is CH2CH2CH2? No, I'm confusing. Let me think again.

Wait, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2- as a substituent. So the structure would be something like CH2CH2-OAc but with a double bond. Wait, no, perhaps I should sketch the possible structures.

Let's consider the options:

Option C: Cis-propenyl acetate. So the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2 of the propenyl group. Structure would be CH2=CH-OAc, but wait that's incorrect. Wait, wait, propenyl is CH2CHCH2, but perhaps I'm getting this mixed up.

Wait, acetates are esters, so the general formula is R-O-CO-R'. For propenyl acetate
