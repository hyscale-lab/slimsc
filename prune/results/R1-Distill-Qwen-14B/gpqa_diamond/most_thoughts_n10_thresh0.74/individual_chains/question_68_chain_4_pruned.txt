Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a spin-1/2 particle and magnetic fields. Hmm, I remember that spin-1/2 particles have their spin in quantum mechanics described by the Pauli matrices or something like that. The particle has a magnetic moment mu, which is given as gamma times Sz. Oh wait, Sz is the spin component in the z-direction, right?

The setup is that the magnetic field is initially along the +Z direction. So the magnetic moment would be aligned with the field, I guess. Then suddenly, the magnetic field is turned off and another one is turned on along the +Y direction. Both fields have the same magnitude, B. So the magnetic field changes direction from Z to Y.

The question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle’s moment. So when the magnetic field changes, the particle's spin state will evolve over time, and this average will oscillate. I need to find the frequency of that oscillation.

I think I should start by recalling how the magnetic moment interacts with a magnetic field. The magnetic moment mu is given by gamma times the spin component S. So mu_z = gamma S_z. But when the magnetic field is along Y, the Hamiltonian would involve S_y, right? Because the energy is given by the dot product of mu and B. So when B is in Y, the Hamiltonian H is proportional to S_y.

Wait, the time evolution of the spin state is determined by the Hamiltonian. So when the field is along Y, the Hamiltonian is H = -gamma B S_y. Because the energy is -mu · B, and mu is gamma S. Oh wait, wait. The magnetic moment mu is gamma times the spin. So mu · B = gamma S · B. So the energy is -mu·B, so H would be -gamma B S · B direction. So when B is along Y, H is -gamma B S_y.

Wait, but in quantum mechanics, the spin operators are S_x, S_y, S_z, each with eigenvalues. For a spin-1/2 particle, these operators have eigenvalues ± ħ/2 multiplied by some factor depending on the direction.

Wait, actually, the spin matrices are usually in units where the eigenvalues are ± ħ/2. But sometimes, when working with angular momentum, we might set ħ=1 for simplicity. But in any case, the Hamiltonian would involve these S_y terms.

So
