Okay, so I've got this question about space travel and time dilation. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my relativity, but let me think this through. Alright, so the setup is that there's an alien civilization in the Large Magellanic Cloud, and they're sending a spacecraft to Earth. The spacecraft is moving at 0.99999987 times the speed of light—that's really, really fast. The astronaut is 22 years old, and we need to figure out how long the trip takes from their perspective.

Wait, the question says "from the point of view of the astronaut," which tells me we're looking at the proper time, right? Because in relativity, proper time is the time measured in the moving frame of reference—in this case, the astronaut's ship. So we'll need to calculate the proper time experienced by the astronaut during the journey.

First, I need to find the distance between the Large Magellanic Cloud and Earth. I remember that the Large Magellanic Cloud is about 163,000 light-years away from Earth. So that's the distance the spaceship has to cover.

The speed of the spaceship is given as 0.99999987c. Let me calculate how long the trip would take from Earth's frame of reference. That would be the distance divided by the speed. So, 163,000 light-years divided by 0.99999987c. Well, since one light-year is the distance light travels in a year, the time in Earth's frame (t) would be 163,000 / 0.99999987 years.

Let me compute that. 163,000 divided by approximately 1 (since 0.99999987 is almost 1) is about 163,000 years. Wait, but wait—that's from Earth's perspective. Because of time dilation, the astronaut's experienced time will be less.

Oh right, time dilation is part of special relativity. The formula is t' = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Wait, no, I think it's t' = gamma^{-1} * t, where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Or wait, no—gamma is the factor by which time dilates. So the astronaut's proper time is t' = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So let's compute gamma. v is 0.99999987c. Let's compute v²/c²: (0.99999987)^2 = approximately 0.99999974. So 1 - v²/c² is 1 - 0.99999974 = 0.00000026.

So sqrt(0.00000026) is sqrt(2.6e-7). Hmm, let me see. The square root of 2.6e-7 is about 5.1e-4, since (5.1e-4)^2 is about 2.6e-7. So sqrt(0.00000026) ≈ 5.099e-4. So gamma is 1/(5.099e-4) ≈ 1960. So gamma is about 1960.

Wait, no. Wait, the formula is gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So 1 - v²/c² is 0.00000026, sqrt is 5.099e-4, so gamma is 1/(5.099e-4) ≈ 1960. So gamma is roughly 1960.

So the time experienced by the astronaut, t', is t divided by gamma. Because t' = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²) which is t / gamma.

Wait, no, wait. Let me clarify. The formula is t' = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Alternatively, since gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²), then t' = t / gamma.

So, from Earth's frame, the trip takes 163,000 years. So in the astronaut's frame, t' = 163,000 / 1960 ≈ let's calculate that.

Dividing 163,000 by 1960: Let's see, 1960 * 80 is 156,800. So 163,000 - 156,800 = 6,200 left. 6,200 divided by 1960 is about 3.16. So approximately 83.16 years.

Wait, but wait a minute. Wait, the distance is 163,000 light-years, and the speed is 0.99999987c. So from Earth's frame, time is (163,000 / 0.99999987) ≈ 163,000 * (1/0.99999987) ≈ 163,000 * 1.00000013 ≈ about 163,000.021 years. Wait, wait, that can't be right. Wait, because 1/0.99999987 is approximately 1.00000013, so 0.99999987 is very
