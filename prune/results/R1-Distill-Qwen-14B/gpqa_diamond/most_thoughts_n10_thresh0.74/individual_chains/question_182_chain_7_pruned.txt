Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which statement about the Mott-Gurney equation is correct. I remember that the Mott-Gurney equation describes the current-voltage behavior in a semiconductor device under the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) regime. But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact conditions when it's applicable.

The equation given is J = (9/8) * ε * μ * V² / L³. I recall that this equation comes from the Child-Langmuir law, which is for the current in a vacuum diode. But when applied to semiconductors, some modifications are made, hence Mott-Gurney.

So, the Mott-Gurney equation is used when the current is limited by the space charge, meaning that the electric field in the device is determined by the charge accumulated in the region. This implies that the device isn't relying on external fields but on the charge built-up. 

In terms of the conditions, I think it's applicable for a single-carrier device, not a double-carrier one. Because if both electrons and holes are contributing, the analysis would be more complicated. So options D, which mentions a two-carrier device, is probably incorrect. So I can eliminate D.

The equation assumes that the charge transport is due to a single type of carrier. So the device should be single-carrier. Looking at the options, options A, B, and C are single-carrier, so D is out.

Now, about the contacts. Ohmic contacts versus Schottky. Ohmic contacts have the same work function as the semiconductor, so there's no barrier. Schottky contacts have a barrier. But in the Mott-Gurney scenario, do we need an Ohmic contact or a Schottky?

Wait, thinking about the original Child-Langmuir in vacuum diodes—those have metal plates, so they must have a certain barrier, but maybe in the semiconductor case, the presence of a contact barrier affects things. Or does the equation not depend on the type of contact as long as it's single-carrier?

Wait another thought: the Mott-Gurney equation is for a trap-free device. Because if there are traps (impurities or defects), they would cause the current to have more complex behavior, like in Fowler-Nordheim tunneling. So the device must be trap-free. So options that say 'trap-free' are better.

Looking at the options, option A says trap-free single-carrier with Ohmic contact and negligible drift current. Option B is trap-free, single-carrier, no carrier injection barrier (so maybe Ohmic?), and negligible diffusion current. Option C says single-carrier, Schottky contact, and negligible diffusion.

Wait, the Mott-Gurney equation is in the SCLC regime. So the current is limited by the space charge. This happens when the voltage is high enough that the space charge dominates the electric field. So it's about the high voltage regime.

In terms of the contacts, the Mott-Gurney equation applies when the injection
