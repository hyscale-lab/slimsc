Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it carefully.

The question is about dissolving 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm³ of solution. Then, I need to find the minimum volume of a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid required to do this. Also, I have to find the pH of the resulting solution.

Hmm, okay. So Fe(OH)3 is a hydroxide, right? And it's a solid, so it's not very soluble in water. But when we add an acid, it should react, right? The acid will donate protons (H+) which should react with the hydroxide ions (OH-) from Fe(OH)3. So the reaction would be something like Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ → Fe³+ + 3H2O.

Wait, but Fe(OH)3 is a weak base, isn't it? Or is it more like a base that can be protonated? I think in this case, since we're using a strong acid, the reaction should go to completion.

So first, I need to find out how much Fe(OH)3 is present. The mass is 0.1 grams. I should calculate the moles of Fe(OH)3.

The molar mass of Fe(OH)3: Fe is about 55.85 g/mol, O is 16, H is 1. So Fe(OH)3 has 55.85 + 3*(16 + 1) = 55.85 + 3*17 = 55.85 +51 = 106.85 g/mol.

Moles of Fe(OH)3 = mass / molar mass = 0.1 g / 106.85 g/mol ≈ 0.000936 mol. Let's double-check that calculation: 0.1 divided by 106.85 is approximately 0.0009358.

Each mole of Fe(OH)3 reacts with 3 moles of H+ (since it's Fe(OH)3). So moles of H+ needed would be 3 * 0.0009358 ≈ 0.002807 mol.

The acid provided is 0.1 M, monobasic. Monobasic means it donates one H+ per molecule, so concentration is 0.1 M. We need the volume of this acid that provides 0.002807 moles.

Volume (in liters) = moles / concentration = 0.002807 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.02807 L = 28.07 cm³. Wait, but the options don't have exactly 28.07. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options, option C is 28.05 cm³. That's very close. So maybe that's the volume needed for the reaction.

But wait, the problem says the total volume is 100 cm³. So the volume of acid added is 28.05 cm³, bringing the total solution to about 100 cm³? Or is the 100 cm³ the solution after adding the acid? Hmm, I think the 100 cm³ is the total volume of the solution after dissolving and adding acid. Because the way the question is phrased: "dissolve ... in 100 cm³ total volume."

Wait, no. Wait, the question says we're dissolving 0.1g Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm³ of total volume. So the solution's total volume is 100 cm³, and we're adding some acid to it to dissolve the Fe(OH)3. So the acid added will probably make up part of that 100 cm³. Hmm, but if I add, say, 28 cm³ of acid, then the total volume would be 100 cm³, but wait, the initial solution might have been less, and adding the acid brings it up to 100.

But wait, the way I approached it earlier is correct: the moles of acid needed is 3 times the moles of Fe(OH)3, so that part is correct. The volume is 28.07 cm³. So the closest option is C: 28.05 cm³.

But wait, the other part of the question is the pH of the resulting solution. So after reacting, the solution will consist of Fe³+ ions and some extra H+ from the acid.

Wait, but since Fe(OH)3 is a base, when it reacts with acid, it should form Fe³+ and water. So in the solution, what's left?

Let me think. The acid is a strong monobasic acid, so it dissociates completely. The reaction is Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ → Fe³+ + 3 H2O.

So after the reaction, the only Fe species is Fe³+ in solution. Now, Fe³+ is a Lewis acid and can hydrolyze in water to produce H+ ions, making the solution acidic.

So the solution will have Fe³+ and H+ from the acid in excess. Wait, but
