Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. Hmm, let me try to figure this out. I remember that when dealing with light and moving media, things can get tricky because of relativity, but I'm not entirely sure.

The question says a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam, towards the observer. We need to find the speed of light relative to the observer in the lab.

Wait, so the glass is moving in the same direction as the light beam, which is also towards the observer. Hmm. So the observer is in the lab, and the glass is moving towards them. The light is propagating through this moving glass.

I think about how the speed of light works in different media. Normally, when light enters a medium with a higher refractive index, its speed decreases. The formula is v = c/n, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum and n is the refractive index. But that's when the medium is at rest relative to the observer.

But here, the medium is moving. So I guess I have to consider the velocity of the medium (glass) relative to the lab frame. Since the glass is moving, the observer in the lab would see the light's speed differently than just v = c/n.

Wait, but according to special relativity, the speed of light should always be c in any inertial frame. Oh wait, no, that's for a vacuum. Because in a medium, the speed can be lower, and the medium itself might affect the measurement.

Wait, no. Wait a second, special relativity says that the speed of light in vacuum is always c. But in a medium, the speed of light is v = c/n, and that's in the rest frame of the medium. If the medium is moving, then from the lab frame, the light's speed relative to the lab would change.

Alternatively, maybe I can use a velocity addition formula here. Because the glass is moving at velocity v, and the light is moving at velocity u in the glass's frame, but we need to find the speed in the lab frame.

Wait, the velocity addition formula in relativity is (u + v)/(1 + (u v)/c²). But wait, that's when u is the velocity of the object in the first frame, and v is the velocity of the first frame relative to the lab. But wait, in this case, the light's velocity in the glass's frame is u = c/n. Because in the glass's rest frame, the light is moving at c/n. So the lab is moving at velocity -v relative to the glass (since the glass is moving at v towards the lab frame).

Wait, no, I think I need to apply the velocity transformation correctly. The lab frame is observing the glass moving at velocity v towards it. So the glass's frame is moving at velocity v relative to the lab. So the light in the glass's frame has velocity u = c/n. So to find the velocity of the light in the lab frame, we use the velocity addition formula.

Wait, but the standard formula is for u' to u, where u' is the velocity in the moving frame (which is the glass frame here). So the velocity in the lab frame would be (u' + v) / (1 + (u' v)/c²).

Wait, that's when the moving frame is the one moving at velocity v relative to the lab.
