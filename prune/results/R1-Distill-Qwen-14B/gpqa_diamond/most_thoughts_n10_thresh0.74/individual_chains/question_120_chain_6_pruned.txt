Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, the question is asking how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with the parallax itself. The options are A through D, each with different exponents of 1 over plx.

Wait, I should start by recalling what I know about parallax. Parallax is the apparent shift in position of a star relative to more distant stars as observed from Earth during different times of the year. The formula for distance using parallax is distance (in parsecs) equals 1 divided by parallax (in arcseconds). So, a star with a larger parallax is closer because the shift is more noticeable.

Now the question says stars are uniformly distributed. Uniformly distributed in what sense? Oh, I think it means that on average, stars are spread out uniformly in all directions and distances. So the number density of stars doesn't depend on direction, only on distance.

But how does that translate to the number of stars per unit parallax? Parallax is inversely proportional to distance. So, as distance increases, parallax decreases. So if I think about a thin shell at a certain distance, its corresponding parallax is small.

Wait, let me think of it another way. The number of stars in a thin spherical shell at distance d is proportional to the surface area of the shell, right? Because more distant shells have larger surface areas. The surface area is 4πd². So the number of stars in a shell at distance d would be proportional to d².

But we need to relate this to parallax. Since parallax p is 1/d (in parsecs), then d = 1/p, so d² is (1/p²). Therefore, the number of stars in a shell with parallax p would be proportional to (1/p²).

But wait, the question is about the number per unit range of parallax. So maybe I should think in terms of how the number of stars changes as we consider a small range of parallax, say from p to p + dp.

Wait, no, the shell at distance d has a specific p. So the number of stars in a thin shell with parallax p is proportional to 1/p². But when considering a range of parallax, say a small interval dp, the corresponding distance interval would be from d to d + dd, where dd is the change in distance.

Wait, maybe I should model the number of stars per unit volume in space. If stars
