Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is to identify a compound with the formula C9H11NO2 using the given spectroscopic data. The options are A to D, each a different organic compound.

First, let me jot down the data provided:

IR:
- Medium to strong bands at 3420 cm-1 and 3325 cm-1. Hmm, those wavenumbers are usually indicative of N-H or O-H stretching. The strong ones at 3420 and 3325 might suggest either amines or amides, maybe. Wait, amides typically have two N-H stretches because of the two NH groups. Or if it's a primary amine, there's a single stretch. But wait, the IR also shows a strong band at 1720 cm-1. That's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So that's probably an ester or amide group, maybe a ketone, but the formula has an O2, so likely not a ketone. So maybe ester or amide.

Looking at the options:

A) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Structure would be benzamide with an ethoxy group at position 3. Benzamide is an amide, so that would have N-H stretches. The IR would have two bands around 3400 region, which would match the data.

B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: Formamide is another amide. So two N-H stretches. Also, it would have a carbonyl in the 1700s, so that fits the 1720 cm-1.

C) 4-aminophenyl propionate: Propionate is an ester. So the carbonyl would be ester, which is around 1720. The aminophenyl group would have N-H stretches. So IR would show N-H stretching, which would fit as well.

D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate: Benzoate is an ester. So the carbonyl would be around 1720 cm-1. The 4-aminophenyl group would have N-H stretches. So that also fits.

So all options have either an amide or ester group, which explains the 1720 cm-1. And all have N-H groups, so the IR fits with that.

Now looking at the NMR data:

Protons:

1.20 ppm (t, 3H): That's a triplet, probably an ethyl group. The triplet suggests coupling with two equivalent protons. So maybe an ethyl group attached to something else, like an oxygen or nitrogen.

4.0 ppm (bs, 2H): Broad singlet, 2H. Could be adjacent to an electronegative atom, maybe O or N. Wait, broad implies possible exchange with something, maybe NH? But in the options, the NH groups are either in amides or amines. Alternatively, it could be an OCH2 group, but why a singlet? If it's an OCH2 with adjacent groups that don't split
