Okay, so I have this physics problem about electromagnetic potentials. Hmm, I remember that when a charge is moving, it creates both electric and magnetic fields, and these are related to the scalar and vector potentials. Let me think about what I know.

The question gives me a point charge q moving along a trajectory s(t). At some time tr, the charge is at a position, and that's when the field is generated. The observation point is r, and d is the vector from where the field was generated to r. So d must be r minus the position of the charge at tr, right? Like, d = r - s(tr).

The velocity of the charge at time tr is v. I'm supposed to find the scalar potential V and the vector potential A at time t, where t is after tr (so t > tr).

I remember the potentials for a moving charge. The scalar potential V is similar to the static case, but there's a correction term because the charge is moving. Or wait, maybe I should recall the retarded potentials. Because when you're dealing with moving charges, especially in relativity, you have to consider the retarded time—like the time it takes for the field to reach the observer.

Wait, the scalar potential V is given by (1/(4πε₀)) times q divided by the distance, but adjusted because the charge isn't at rest. Oh wait, no, the scalar potential for a moving charge is still similar to the static case because it's the time component of the four-potential, right? Or maybe not exactly because of the motion affecting the field.

Wait, no, the scalar potential due to a charge moving with velocity v would involve a term that includes the velocity, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact form. Alternatively, I think the potentials can be expressed using the velocity. Let me think about the general expressions for the potentials when a charge is moving.

The scalar potential V due to a charge q at position r and time t is given by (q/(4πε₀)) times 1 over the distance, but considering the retarded time. Or wait, the scalar potential when the charge is moving is similar to the static case but with a Lorentz factor involved? Or maybe it's more about the dependence on the velocity.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think about the general formula for V and A. The scalar potential is V
