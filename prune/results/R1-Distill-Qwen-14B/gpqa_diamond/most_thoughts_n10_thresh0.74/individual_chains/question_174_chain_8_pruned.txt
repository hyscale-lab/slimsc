Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about nuclear fission and energy. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a shot.

So the problem says an atomic nucleus with mass M is at rest, and its rest-mass energy is 300 GeV. Then it undergoes spontaneous fission into two fragments. The first fragment is twice as massive as the other. Also, the sum of their rest masses is 99% of M. I need to find the difference between the correct kinetic energy T1 of the more massive fragment and the value calculated using classical (non-relativistic) approximation.

Wait, so the initial nucleus is at rest, which means its momentum is zero. After fission, the two fragments must move in opposite directions to conserve momentum. Since momentum is conserved, their momenta must be equal in magnitude but opposite in direction. Because the problem specifies the rest masses, I think I'll have to calculate their velocities using relativistic equations because the energies involved are really high—300 GeV is way beyond non-relativistic scales.

Let me note down the given data:

- Initial rest mass energy: 300 GeV.
- After fission, two fragments. Let's call their masses m1 and m2.
- m1 = 2 * m2 (since one is twice as massive as the other).
- m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M.

Wait, wait. M is the initial mass of the nucleus. So M should be equal to m1 + m2? Wait, no, because the problem says the sum of the rest masses is 99% of M. So m1 + m2 = 0.99 M.

Wait, but the initial rest mass energy is 300 GeV. So the rest mass energy is M c² = 300 GeV. But when it splits, the sum of the rest masses of the two fragments is 0.99 M c²? Because rest mass is measured in energy units when multiplied by c².

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of mass. Let's say M is the rest mass of the nucleus. Then, the rest masses of the fragments m1 and m2: m1 + m2 = 0.99 M. But m1 is twice m2, so m1 = 2
