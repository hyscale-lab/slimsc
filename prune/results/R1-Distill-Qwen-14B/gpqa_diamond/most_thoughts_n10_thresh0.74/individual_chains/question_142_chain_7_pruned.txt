Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked. The question is about the density matrix of a qubit and where it's located geometrically in the qubit space. Hmm, I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's in a mixed state. 

The given density matrix is ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). I think I should start by expanding this. I remember that the outer product |0⟩⟨0| is a matrix that's 1 in the top-left corner and 0 elsewhere, and similarly for |1⟩⟨1|, which is 1 in the bottom-right. So when I add them together, each diagonal element becomes 1. Then multiplying by 1/2, the diagonal entries are 1/2 each. 

So the matrix ρ would look like [[0.5, 0], [0, 0.5]]. Wait, no wait, let me think again. No, wait, |0⟩⟨0| is actually a 2x2 matrix where only the (1,1) element is 1, others are zero. Similarly, |1⟩⟨1| has (2,2) element as 1. So adding them gives a diagonal matrix with [1,1] on the diagonal. Then multiplying by 1/2, each diagonal element becomes 1/2. So ρ is a 2x2 diagonal matrix with entries 0.5 and 0.5. So the matrix is [[0.5, 0], [0, 0.5]].

Now, the question is about the geometrical position in the qubit space. Hmm, I'm a bit fuzzy on this. I think qubit states are often represented in the Bloch sphere, right? The Bloch sphere is a geometric representation of qubit states. For a pure state |ψ⟩, the Bloch vector r has components (x,y,z) that correspond to the angles θ and φ in the state's spherical coordinates.

Wait, but ρ here isn't a pure state. It's a mixed state, right? Because for a pure state, the density matrix would have a trace of 1 and satisfy ρ² = ρ. Let me check: the trace of ρ is 0.5 + 0.5 = 1, which is correct. But ρ squared would be (1/2)^2 (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1| ) squared. Hmm, wait, |0⟩⟨0| squared is |0⟩⟨0|, same for |1⟩⟨1|. So ρ squared is (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|) again, which is equal to ρ. Wait, that's interesting. So this looks like a pure state's density matrix. But wait, no, that's not right. Wait, wait, no, wait. If ρ is a density matrix, it's a pure state if and only if ρ² = ρ. Because for a pure state |ψ⟩⟨ψ|, the square is |ψ⟩⟨ψ|, so it's idempotent. But in this case, ρ = (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1| ) / 2. So ρ² would be (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1| ) / 2 squared. Let me compute that.

Wait, let's compute ρ². ρ is a diagonal matrix with 0.5 on the diagonal. So squaring it would give each diagonal element squared, which is 0.25. So the diagonal elements are 0.25 each. So ρ² is [[0.25, 0], [0, 0.25]]. But ρ was [[0.5, 0], [0, 0.5]]. So ρ² is not equal to ρ.
