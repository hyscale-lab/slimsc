Okay, so I've got this question about electron microscopes and vacuum conditions. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through. 

The question is about the mean free path of gas molecules in the sample compartment of a transmission electron microscope. Mike created an ultra-high vacuum, but some gas particles were still present. He measured the mean free path as λ1 under these conditions. But when he turned on the electron beam, the mean free path changed to λ2. The options are about the relationship between λ2 and λ1.

Wait, what's the mean free path again? Oh right, it's the average distance a molecule travels between collisions. In a vacuum, if the pressure is low (so fewer molecules), the mean free path is longer. Because when there are fewer gas particles, the molecules don't bump into each other as often, so they can travel further before a collision.

So initially, the vacuum is at <10^-9 Torr, and the mean free path is λ1. But when the electron beam is on, something happens to change λ to λ2. The question is, why would the mean free path change? And how?

I remember that the mean free path depends on factors like pressure, temperature, and the size of the gas molecules. The formula I think is λ = (k*T)/(sqrt(2)*π*d^2*p), where k is Boltzmann's constant, T is temperature, d is the diameter of the molecule, and p is the pressure. But wait, maybe it's more about the number density. Because pressure is related to number of molecules per volume.

But wait, when the electron beam is active, it's emitting electrons. Those electrons are high-energy, right? So they might interact with the gas molecules in the compartment. How does that affect the gas molecules?

Oh, right! The electron beam can cause electron scattering. So when electrons hit gas molecules, they might cause the gas molecules to ionize or maybe even knock them out of the compartment. Alternatively, perhaps the electrons don't directly remove the gas, but their presence could affect the mean free path in another way.

Wait, maybe it's about the increased pressure in the system when the beam is on. But no, the pressure was already ultra-low. Hmm. Alternatively, the beam's energy could cause gas molecules to move more, increasing their velocity, which would affect the mean free path.

Wait,
