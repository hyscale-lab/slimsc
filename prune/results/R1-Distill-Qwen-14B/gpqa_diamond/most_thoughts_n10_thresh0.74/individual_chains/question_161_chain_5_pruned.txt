Okay, I'm trying to figure out this question about the mean free path of gas molecules in an electron microscope. Hmm, let's see what the question says.

So Mike is working on a high-resolution transmission electron microscope. He uses vacuum pumps to get an ultra-high vacuum, less than 10^-9 Torr. The idea is to minimize gas molecules because that improves electron microscopy. But even with that, some gas particles are still present, as detected by a mass spectrometer. 

Mike calculated the mean free path, which is λ1. Mean free path depends on factors like pressure, temperature, and the size of the molecules. Oh right, the mean free path is the average distance a molecule travels between collisions. The formula I remember is λ = (k*T)/(√2 * π * d² * P), where k is Boltzmann's constant, T is temperature, d is the diameter of the molecule, and P is pressure. 

Wait, but when Mike starts the electron beam, he notices that the mean free path changes to λ2. The temperature is the same, so T hasn't changed. The question is why λ2 isn't equal to λ1 anymore.

Thinking about the factors affecting mean free path. The main factors are pressure, temperature, and the effective diameter of the particles. Here, the pressure in the compartment is already very low, so the mean free path should be large. But when the electron beam is on, maybe something else is happening.

Wait, the electron beam is a source of energy. The electrons might be transferring energy to the gas molecules. If the gas molecules get heated, their kinetic energy increases. Since temperature is the same, but wait, the electrons are moving at high speeds. Oh, but the question says the sample compartment's temperature remained the same. So maybe the temperature of the gas itself isn't changing. Hmm, but wait, another factor: when the electrons scatter off the gas molecules, it's a different interaction than just thermal motion.

Alternatively, the electron beam could cause ionization of the gas molecules. If the gas molecules become charged, they might behave differently. Charged particles in a vacuum might have different interactions. Like, they could stick to the walls or other surfaces, or maybe get accelerated by electric fields within the microscope. 

But wait, the mean free path is about how far a molecule travels before colliding with another molecule. If the gas molecules are being ionized, perhaps they're being removed from the system. Because charged particles are more likely to stick to surfaces or be pumped out by the vacuum system. That would effectively reduce the number of gas particles in the compartment. 

So if there are fewer gas particles, the pressure is lower than before. Since mean free path λ is inversely proportional to pressure (λ ∝ 1/P), if pressure drops, λ increases. So λ2 would be larger than λ1. So λ2 > λ1.

Wait, but wait. The question says that Mike accurately determined λ1 based on sample compartment volume, pressure, and temperature. So λ1 was calculated under the existing conditions. Then, when the electron beam is turned on, something changes the effective pressure. If the gas molecules are being removed due to collisions with the electron beam (like getting knocked out of the compartment), the effective pressure would decrease.

Alternatively, perhaps the electron beam causes the gas to heat up locally, increasing the temperature. But the question states that the sample compartment temperature remains the same,
