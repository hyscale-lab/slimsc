Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Let me see if I can figure it out step by step. Hmm. The question is about the orbital periods of three exoplanets. The given data includes the ratios of their equilibrium temperatures and masses, and their albedos are the same as Earth's, which is 0.3. I need to find by what factor Planet3's orbital period is larger than Planet1's.

Wait, equilibrium temperature... right, the formula for equilibrium temperature is based on the Stefan-Boltzmann law, I think. The equilibrium temperature (T) of a planet depends on the star's luminosity (L), the planet's distance from the star (d), and the planet's albedo (a). The formula is T = [(L (1 - a))/(16 π σ d²)]^(1/4). Oh wait, but since we're dealing with ratios, maybe the L and σ will cancel out, especially since all planets orbit the same star, so L is the same for all.

So the equilibrium temperature ratio between two planets should depend on the square root of the inverse ratio of their distances. Because T is proportional to (L/(d²))^(1/4), so T1/T2 = (d2/d1)^(1/2). Let me write that down:

T1/T2 = sqrt(d2/d1) → so (d2/d1) = (T1/T2)^2.

But wait, the problem gives T1/T2 as 1.4. So d2/d1 would be (1.
