Okay, so I've got this question about optical activity in organic compounds. Hmm, I need to figure out how many of the given compounds exhibit optical activity. Let me start by recalling what optical activity means. A compound is optically active if it has chiral centers, meaning they have a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. Alternatively, it could have other forms of chirality, like in allenes or certain rings, but I think for this question, focusing on chiral centers should be sufficient.

The question lists seven compounds. I'll go through each one by one.

1. **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**
   Let's draw the structure. The compound is but-1-ene, so the double bond is between C1 and C2. The substituents on C1 are Cl, a CH2CH3 (since it's 2-methyl), and two CH2 groups? Wait, no. Wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3, but with substituents. The molecule is (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. So the structure would be Cl attached to C1, which is double bonded to C2. C2 has a methyl group and another substituent.

   Wait, but for 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene, the structure is Clâ€”C(CH2CH3)=CHCH3? No, wait, but but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl on C1. So the substituents on C1 are Cl, two Hs, and the double bond. So the structure is Cl-C=CH-CH2CH3? Hmm, wait, maybe I'm getting confused.

   Alternatively, perhaps it's Cl on C1, with the double bond to C2, which has a methyl group. So C1 is Cl, two CH2 groups? Maybe not. Let me think again. But-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 2-methyl would make it CH2=C(CH3)CH2CH3? No, wait, 2-methyl is a methyl group on C2 of butene. So 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would have Cl on C1, which is double bonded to C2. C2 has a methyl group and a CH2CH3 group? Wait, but butene is four carbons
