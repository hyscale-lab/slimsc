Okay, so I've got this problem about spins and the partition function. Hmm, let's see. The question is about three spins, S1, S2, and S3. Each spin can be +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. I need to find the partition function Z.

Wait, partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of exp(-βE), right? Because β is 1/(kT), so it's like weighting each state by its Boltzmann factor.

Each spin has two possible states, so for three spins, there are 2^3 =8 possible states in total. But wait, how do the spin states contribute to the energy?

Let me think about each possible combination. Each state is determined by the values of S1, S2, S3. Since each can be ±1, the possible values for each product S_i S_j would be either +1 or -1.

Wait, but the energy is E = -J*(sum of these products). So for each triplet (S1, S2, S3), I need to compute E, then compute exp(-βE), and sum all these.

Hmm, but maybe there's a smarter way than listing all 8 possibilities. Maybe group states by the number of neighboring pairs that are aligned or anti-aligned. Because each product S_i S_j is +1 if they are the same, -1 if different.

Wait, the sum inside E is S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3. Let me think about how that sum can vary.

Each term S_iS_j can be +1 or -1. So the sum can be 3, 1, -1, or -3? Let's see. For example:

If all three terms are +1: sum is 3. So E would be -J*(3) = -3J.

If two terms are +1, one -1: sum is 1. E = -J*(1) = -J.

If one term +1, two -1: sum is -1. E= -J*(-1) = J.

If all terms are -1: sum is -3. E= -J*(-3) =3J.

Wait, but in the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3, how can
