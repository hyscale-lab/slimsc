Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about the Hamiltonian operator. Hmm, let's try to think through it step by step. The question is asking for the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian H, which is given as ε multiplied by the dot product of σ and n vectors. Okay, so H = ε σ · n.

Wait, σ is the Pauli spin matrices, right? And n is a unit vector, so it's arbitrary direction. Oh right, the Pauli matrices are σ_x, σ_y, σ_z, each being 2x2 matrices. So when you take the dot product σ · n, you're essentially doing a sum of each σ component multiplied by the corresponding component of n.

Let me write this out. Suppose n is (n_x, n_y, n_z). Then σ · n would be n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z. So H is ε times that. So H = ε (n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z).

Now, to find the eigenvalues of H. I remember that for any 2x2 Hermitian matrix like this, the eigenvalues can be found using the trace and determinant. Alternatively, since this operator is proportional to a Pauli vector, maybe there's a simpler way.

Wait, Pauli matrices have some properties. Each Pauli matrix individually has eigenvalues ±1. But when you have a linear combination like σ · n, which is a vector in spin space, its eigenvalues should be ±1 multiplied by ε, perhaps?

Wait, no. Let me think deeper. The Pauli matrices are traceless, and each has eigenvalues ±1. So the matrix σ · n would also have eigenvalues ±1 because n is a unit vector. Because any unit vector dotted into σ gives a matrix that's Hermitian and traceless, just like each σ_i. So the eigenvalues would be ±1.

But wait, the Hamiltonian is ε times this matrix. So H = ε (σ · n). So the eigenvalues of H would be ε times the eigenvalues of σ·n. So that would be ±ε * 1, so ±ε.

Wait, but let me confirm. Suppose I have a 2x2 matrix A. If A has eigenvalues λ, then aA has eigenvalues aλ. So if σ·n has eigenvalues ±1, then H would have eigenvalues ε * (±1) → ±ε.

Looking at the options, option B is +ε, -ε.
