Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let's see what it's about. The question is about finding the expectation value of an operator for a spin-half particle. I'm a bit rusty on my QM, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The particle is in a state that's a linear combination of spin-up and spin-down states. The state is given as 0.5|↑⟩ + (√3)/2 |↓⟩. I remember that |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of the σz operator, which is one of the Pauli matrices. So, σz has eigenvalues +1 and -1 for these states respectively.

The operator we're looking at is 10σz + 5σx. Wait, expectation value of this operator. Oh right, the expectation value is the average value you'd measure if you measured this operator many times on the same state.

I think the approach is to compute the expectation value for each part separately and then combine them. So, calculate ⟨10σz⟩ and ⟨5σx⟩, then add them together.

First, let's compute ⟨σz⟩. Since the state is a superposition, the expectation value of σz is the sum of the probabilities of each state multiplied by their respective eigenvalues. The state is 0.5|↑⟩ + (√3/2)|↓⟩. So the coefficients are 0.5 and (√3)/2.

Wait, the square of the coefficients gives the probabilities. So for |↑⟩, the probability is (0.5)^2 = 0.25, and for |↓⟩, it's ( (√3)/2 )^2 = (3/4) = 0.75. Because σz|↑⟩ = +1|↑⟩ and σz|↓⟩ = -1|↓⟩, the expectation value ⟨σz⟩ is (0.25)(+1) + (0.75)(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5.

So ⟨10σz⟩ would be 10 times that, which is 10*(-0.5) = -5.

Now the tougher part: ⟨σx⟩. I remember that σx is another Pauli matrix, which is [[0,1],[1,0]]. Its eigenstates are |+⟩ and |−⟩, which are superpositions of |↑⟩ and |↓⟩. But wait, our state is a combination of |↑⟩ and |↓⟩, so to find ⟨σx⟩, perhaps I need to compute it directly.

The expectation value of σx is ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩, where |ψ⟩ is our given state. Let me write this out.

Expressed in the computational basis, |↑⟩ is [1; 0] and |↓⟩ is [0; 1]. So our state |ψ⟩ is a column vector [0.5; (√3)/2].

So σx matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So to compute ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩, I can write it as:

[0.5*, (√3/2)*] * [[0,1],[1,0]] * [0.5; (√3)/2]

Wait, 0.5* is 0.5, since real numbers, same with (√3/2)* = √3/2.

Let's compute the matrix multiplication step by step.

First, multiply σx with |ψ⟩:

σx|ψ⟩ = [0*0.5 + 1*(√3/2), 1*0.5 + 0*(√3/2)]^T = [ (√3/2), 0.5 ]^T.

Then, take the inner product with ⟨ψ|, which is [0.5, √3/2].

So ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩ = (0.5)*(√
