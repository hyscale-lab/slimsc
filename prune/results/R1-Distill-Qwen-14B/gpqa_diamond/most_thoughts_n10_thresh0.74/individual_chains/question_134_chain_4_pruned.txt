Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when some acids and a base are mixed. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me think this through.

So the problem says: 500 mL of 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL of 0.3 M H2SO4, and 200 mL of 0.5 M Ba(OH)2 are mixed. I need to find the enthalpy change.

Wait, wait. I remember that enthalpy of neutralization is usually the heat released when an acid reacts with a base to form water. But wait, when you mix an acid and a base, it's an exothermic reaction, right? So the enthalpy should be negative, which matches the options.

But wait, the problem here is a bit more complicated because there are multiple acids and a base. Oh, right, H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, so it can donate two H+ ions. But Ba(OH)2 is a strong base; it dissociates into Ba^2+ and OH^- ions. Each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives two OH^- ions. So I need to calculate the moles of H+ and OH- and see which is the limiting reactant.

Let me calculate the moles of each acid and base.

First, HCl: 500 mL is 0.5 L. Molarity is 0.2 M. Moles = M * V = 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 moles. Since HCl is a strong acid, it dissociates completely, so H+ from HCl is 0.1 moles.

Next, H2SO4: 300 mL is 0.3 L. Molarity 0.3 M. Moles = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles. But H2SO4 is diprotic. So each mole gives 2 H+. So total H+ from H2SO4 is 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

So total H+ from both acids: 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 moles.

Now the base, Ba(OH)2: 200 mL is 0.2 L. Molarity 0.5 M. Moles = 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 moles. Ba(OH)2 dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2 OH^- per formula unit. So each mole gives 2 moles of OH-. So total OH- is 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 moles.

Now, the reaction between H+ and OH- is:

H+ + OH- → H2O.

The H+ comes from both HCl and H2SO4, but the OH- comes from Ba(OH)2. So we have 0.28 moles H+ and 0.2 moles OH-.

The limiting reactant is OH- because 0.2 < 0.28. So all the OH- will react, and some H+ will remain.

Wait, but wait. The neutralization reaction is between H+ and OH-. So the amount of heat released depends on the moles of H+ and OH- reacting. Since OH- is the limiting reagent, only 0.2 moles will react.

But wait, H2SO4 is a strong acid as well, so both H+ ions from H2SO4 will react if possible. But the base is the limiting factor.

So, the neutralization reaction will involve 0.2 moles of H+ (from whatever sources—HCl and H2SO4) and 0.2 moles of OH-.

Wait, but wait another thing. H2SO4 is a diprotic acid,
