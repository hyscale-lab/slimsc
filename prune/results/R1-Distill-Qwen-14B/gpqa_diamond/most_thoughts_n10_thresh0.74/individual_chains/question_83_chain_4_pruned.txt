Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem says: We dilute 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate the resulting solution with 0.1 M NaOH at 25°C. The question is asking for the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given, and the Ka of acetic acid is 1.85x10^-5.

Hmm, so I remember that when you dilute a weak acid, the concentration of H+ ions decreases because the acid doesn't dissociate as much in a more dilute solution. Then, when you titrate it with NaOH, which is a strong base, you're neutralizing the acid. 

First, I need to find the initial concentration after dilution. The initial volume is 20 cm³ and the concentration is 0.05 M. When we add 20 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40 cm³. So the new concentration would be (20 cm³ * 0.05 M) / 40 cm³ = (1 * 0.05)/2 = 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Wait, wait. Let me double-check that. Molarity is moles over volume in liters. So original moles of acetic acid: 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 moles. After dilution, volume is 0.04 L, so new concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Yes, that's correct.

Now, the titration with NaOH. The first part is about finding the pH at 25% titration. The second part is the equivalence point pH.

Let me tackle the 25% titration first. To find pH at 25% titration, I need to find how much NaOH has been added. 

The volume of NaOH at 25% would be 25% of the total volume needed to reach the equivalence point. So I need to find the equivalence point volume first.

Wait, equivalence point is when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid. The initial moles of acetic acid after dilution is 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 moles. Since NaOH is 0.1 M, the volume V needed is (0.001 moles) / (0.1 M) )= 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. So the equivalence point is at 10 cm³ of NaOH.

But wait, the question is about 25% titration, which is 25% of the equivalence point volume. So 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added.

So during the titration, I need to calculate the moles of NaOH added (2.5 cm³ * 0.1 M) = 0.25 mmol. Because 2.5 cm³ is 0.0025 L, 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 mol, which is 0.25 mmol.

Wait, the initial moles of acetic acid are 0.001 mol (from 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 mol). So when I add 0.25 mmol of OH-, it will react with the acetic acid.

The reaction is: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+
