Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about an annihilation process. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the problem says a proton and an antiproton annihilate to produce two particles of type A plus and two of A minus. The antiproton is moving slowly, and the mass of each A particle is given as 300 MeV/c².

Wait, the question is asking for the velocity of particle A. So I need to find v in terms of the speed of light c.

First, I think I should consider conservation of energy and momentum. Since the antiproton is moving slowly, maybe I can approximate its kinetic energy as much less than its rest mass energy. Wait, but wait, the rest mass of a proton is about 938 MeV/c², right? So if the antiproton is moving slowly, its kinetic energy is low, but its rest mass is the same as a proton's.

So the initial particles are a proton (p) and an antiproton (p̄). The proton is probably at rest or maybe moving, but the problem says the antiproton is moving slowly. Wait, the problem doesn't specify whether the proton is moving, but I think in this scenario, perhaps the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving towards it. Or maybe the system's center of momentum is considered.

Wait, but when particles annihilate, they typically produce other particles. In this case, they produce two A+ and two A- particles. Since the number of particles changes, the conservation laws must still hold.

Let me think about the
