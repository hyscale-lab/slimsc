Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about dissolving Fe(OH)3 in a strong acid and determining the minimum volume of the acid needed and the pH of the resulting solution.

Alright, first, I think I need to understand the reaction involved. Fe(OH)3 is a weak base, and when it reacts with a strong acid, they should neutralize each other. The acid is monobasic, which means it donates one H+ ion. So, the reaction should be something like Fe(OH)3 reacting with HCl to form FeCl3 and water.

Wait, right. The reaction equation would be Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ → Fe^3+ + 3H2O. Oh wait, no, wait. Monobasic acid gives one H+ per molecule. So the formula needs to balance the H+ ions from the acid with the OH- ions from Fe(OH)3.

Fe(OH)3 has three OH groups. So, each mole of Fe(OH)3 would react with 3 moles of H+ (from the strong acid) to produce Fe^3+ and water. So the reaction is:

Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ → Fe^3+ + 3H2O.

So, I need to calculate how many moles of Fe(OH)3 I have, then find out how many moles of H+ are required, which will tell me the volume of the 0.1 M acid needed.

The mass of Fe(OH)3 is 0.1 grams. Let me find its molar mass. Fe is about 55.85 g/mol, O is 16, H is 1. So Fe(OH)3: 55.85 + 3*(16 +1) = 55.85 + 3*17 = 55.85 + 51 = 106.85 g/mol.

So moles of Fe(OH)3 = 0.1 g / 106.85 g/mol ≈ 0.000936 moles. Let me calculate that more accurately. 0.1 / 106.85 is approximately 0.00093595 mol.

Since each mole of Fe(OH)3 requires 3 moles of H+, the moles of H+ needed are 0.00093595 * 3 ≈ 0.00280785 moles.

Now, the H+ comes from the strong monobasic acid, which is 0.1 M. The concentration is 0.1 mol per liter (since 100 cm³ is 0.1 L, but wait, the acid volume is what we're finding, so let me think. The volume is V liters, so moles H+ = 0.1 * V.

Setting that equal to the required H+ moles: 0.1 * V = 0.00280785 → V = 0.00280785 / 0.1 = 0.0280785 liters, which is 28.0785 cm³. So about 28.08 cm³ of acid. Looking at the options, option C is 28.05 cm³. Close enough, considering rounding.

Wait, but wait a second. The problem states "dissolve in 100 cm³ total volume." So when we add the acid, the total volume becomes 100 cm³, right? Oh
