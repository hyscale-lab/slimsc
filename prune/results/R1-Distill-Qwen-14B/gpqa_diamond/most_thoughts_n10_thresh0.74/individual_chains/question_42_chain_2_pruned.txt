Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem. Let me read through it carefully.

So, there are three exoplanets: Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3. They have circular orbits and were discovered using the TTV method. The question gives me some ratios of their equilibrium temperatures and masses, and asks about the ratio of their orbital periods. Also, their albedo is the same as Earth's, which is 0.3. 

The given data:
- Temperature ratio Planet1 to Planet2 is approximately 1.4. So T1/T2 = 1.4.
- Temperature ratio Planet2 to Planet3 is approximately 2.3. So T2/T3 = 2.3.
- Mass ratio Planet1 to Planet2 is 1.15. So M1/M2 = 1.15.
- Mass ratio Planet2 to Planet3 is 1.35. So M2/M3 = 1.35.

We need to find how much larger the orbital period of Planet3 is compared to Planet1. So the factor is Period3 / Period1 = ?

Hmm. I remember that the equilibrium temperature of a planet depends on its distance from the star and its albedo. The formula for equilibrium temperature is:

T = [ (L * (1 - a)) / (16 * π * σ * D²) ) ]^(1/4)

Wait, but I think a simplified version is T ∝ sqrt(L/(D²)), but I might be getting this wrong. Wait, no, the equilibrium temperature formula is T = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2D)) * ( (1 - a) )^(1/4), where T_star is the star's effective temperature, R_star is its radius, and D is the planet's orbital distance. But since all three planets orbit the same star, L (the star's luminosity) and R_star and T_star are the same for all. So the temperature ratio between them would depend only on the square root of the inverse of their distances. So T ∝ 1/sqrt(D). 

Wait, another approach: the equilibrium temperature T of a planet is given by the formula:

T = [ (L (1 - a)) / (16 π σ D²) ) ]^(1/4)

So T ∝ sqrt( L^(1/4) ) / D^(1/2) )

But since L is the same for all planets (same star), T ∝ 1 / sqrt(D). So the ratio of their temperatures can be used to find the ratio of their distances.

So let's get the ratio of Planet1 and Planet2's temperatures first. T1/T2 = 1.4.

But since T ∝ 1/sqrt(D), then T1/T2 = sqrt(D2/D1). Wait, because T1 is proportional to 1/sqrt(D1), T2 is proportional to 1/sqrt(D2). So T1/T2 = [1/sqrt(D1)] / [1/sqrt(D2)] ] = sqrt(D2/D1). 

So 1.4 = sqrt( D2 / D1 ). Squaring both sides, 1.96 = D2/D1. So D2 = 1.96 * D1.

Similarly, the temperature ratio between Planet2 and Planet3 is 2.3. So T2/T3 = 2.3.

Again, T2/T3 = sqrt(D3/D2) because T ∝ 1/sqrt(D). So 2.3 = sqrt(D3/D2). Squaring, 5.29 = D3/D2. So D3 =5.29 * D2.

Now, since D2 is 1.96 D1, D3 =5.29 * 1.96 D1 = let me compute that. 5.29 * 1.96 is approximately 10.3444. So D3 ≈ 10.3444 D1.

Wait, but wait, let me recompute that. 5.29 * 1.9
