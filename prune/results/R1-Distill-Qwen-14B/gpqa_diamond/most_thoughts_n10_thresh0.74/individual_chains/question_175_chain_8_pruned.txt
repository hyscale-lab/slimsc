Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about oscillating charges and radiation. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question says we have an oscillating charge distribution that's spheroidal, with the symmetry along the z-axis. Because it's oscillating, it radiates at a wavelength lambda. In the radiation zone, the power per unit solid angle is a function f of lambda and theta, the angle from the z-axis. The maximum power is A, and they're asking what fraction of A is radiated at theta = 30 degrees, and what the possible form of f is.

Alright, so I remember from my electromagnetism classes that when charges oscillate, they emit electromagnetic radiation. The dipole radiation comes into play here. Oh right, the dipole approximation is used when the radiation is far away, so the radiation zone is where the multipole expansion applies.

So the power radiated by an oscillating dipole is given by the Larmor formula, right? The power is proportional to ( (d^3 p)/(dt^3) )^2, where p is the dipole moment. Wait, but for a dipole, the radiation pattern isn't isotropic. I remember that the radiation pattern for a dipole has a maximum in the plane perpendicular to the axis (so theta=90 degrees), and it goes to zero along the axis (theta=0 and 180).

Wait, no, wait. Dipole radiation actually has maximum intensity perpendicular to the dipole. So for a dipole aligned along the z-axis, the radiation is strongest at theta=90 degrees. The intensity drops off as you move towards theta=0 and theta=180. The standard radiation pattern for a dipole is something like (sin(theta))^2. Because the power per unit solid angle (the intensity) depends on the sine squared of theta.

Wait, but when I think about the power, the total power radiated is the integral of the intensity over all solid angles. So integrating (sin(theta))^2 over the sphere should give me the total power, which is A in this problem.

So the function f(theta) must be proportional to (sin(theta))^2. But the problem mentions that f is a function of lambda and theta. Oh wait, the problem states that the function is f of lambda and theta. So the form of f must include lambda dependence as well.

Wait, the power per unit solid angle would depend on the frequency or wavelength, right? Because the radiation from an oscillating charge depends on the square of the acceleration, which relates to the frequency. So the intensity should be proportional to (1/lambda^something) times (sin theta)^2.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let's think about the Larmor formula. The total power radiated by an accelerating charge is P = (e^2 a^2)/(6πε0 c^3), where a is the acceleration. If the charge is oscillating harmonically, a is proportional to ω^2, where ω is the angular frequency. So a^2 is ω^4. Then P is proportional to ω^4. Since ω = 2π c / λ (because c = f λ, and ω = 2π f), so ω^4 is (1/λ^4) multiplied by factors. So the total power is proportional to 1/lambda^4.

But wait, the power per unit solid angle is the intensity. So the intensity I is P divided by 4π, but also multiplied by the radiation pattern. Wait, no, the intensity is the power per unit area per unit solid angle. So for a dipole, the intensity I is proportional to (sin theta)^2 and also to 1/lambda^4.

Wait, I'm not sure about the exact dependencies. Let's think again.
