Okay, so I have this problem about a vector field and evaluating the divergence inside a sphere. Hmm, let's see. The vector field f(r) falls off as 1/r² and has only a radial component. So, in spherical coordinates, it's probably something like f = (F/r²) er, where er is the radial unit vector.

Wait, I remember that the divergence of a vector field in spherical coordinates isn't too bad. The formula for divergence is a bit specific for spherical symmetry. Oh right, the divergence of a vector field A is (1/(r²)) d(r² A_r) / dr + ... for the other components, but since this field only has the radial component, the other terms might be zero.

So, let's compute ∇ · f. The divergence in spherical coordinates for a radial field would be (1/r²) d/dr (r² f_r). Since f_r is the radial component, which is 1/r². So f_r = 1/r². Plugging into the divergence formula: (1/r²) d/dr [ r² * (1/r²) ].

Let me compute that. r² * (1/r²) is 1. The derivative of 1 with respect to r is 0. So the divergence is zero, right? That would mean that ∇ · f is zero everywhere except maybe at the origin. Wait, but at r=0, the function isn't defined because 1/r² would be infinite. So there's probably a delta function there because of Gauss's law or something similar.

Oh wait, the problem is asking for the volume integral of the divergence over a sphere of radius R. So integrating ∇ · f over the volume. If ∇ · f is zero everywhere except at r=0, then the integral would be zero except possibly at the origin. But we're integrating over a volume, so if the divergence is zero everywhere inside except at a point (the origin), which has measure zero, then the integral should be zero, right? Unless the divergence isn't actually zero because of the origin's contribution.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me think again. The divergence is zero for r not equal to zero. So the integral over the volume would be zero because the divergence is zero everywhere except at the origin, which doesn't contribute to the volume integral. But wait, isn't this similar to the electric field of a point charge? For example, the electric field of a point charge has zero divergence
