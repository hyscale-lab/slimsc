Okay, so I've got this problem here about two planets orbiting a star, and I need to find the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the question gives me a bunch of data: the star's mass is 1.5 solar masses, radius 1.2 solar radii, and effective temperature 6300 K. Each planet has its own mass and radius. Planet1 is 7 Earth masses, radius 1.7 Earth radii. Planet2 is 5 Earth masses, radius 1.3 Earth radii. Both are in circular orbits.

Then there's some stuff about the transit and radial velocity methods. Oh right, the transit method detects planets when they pass in front of the star, causing a dip in brightness. Radial velocity detects the Doppler shift as the planet's gravity makes the star wobble. But I'm not sure how that ties into the problem yet.

The problem mentions periodic shifts in the [OI] line at 6300 Å. Planet1 causes a shift of 0.03 Å, and Planet2 causes 0.04 Å. Wait, but how does that relate to their masses? Oh right, the radial velocity method measures the Doppler shift, which depends on the planet's mass and the size of the orbit.

Wait, but the question is about equilibrium temperatures. Oh, equilibrium temperature usually depends on the star's luminosity and the planet's distance from the star. The formula I remember is T_eq = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) ), where a is the planet's orbital radius.

But wait, I don't have the orbital periods or distances given. Hmm. So I need another approach. Maybe I can find the ratio of the distances from the star using the radial velocity data.

The radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by (for a star) K = (v) = [ (G * M_planet * sin(i)) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) ]^(1/3) * (1/( (1 + M_planet/M_star) )^(1/3) )

But since both planets are detected via RV, and assuming circular orbits (e=0), and since the star's mass is much larger than the planets (1.5 Sun vs 5-7 Earths), M_planet/M_star is negligible. So we can approximate M_star + M_planet ≈ M_star.

So simplifying, K ≈ ( (G * M_p * sin i) / (M_star^(2/3)) )^(1/3) ) * (1/sqrt(1 - e²))^(1/3). But since e=0, that term is 1.

Wait, but sin i is the sine of the inclination angle. For transiting planets, the inclination is close to 90 degrees, so sin i ≈ 1. But the problem doesn’t specify if they transit, but the question says both were detected via transit and RV. So yes, inclination is 90 degrees, so sin i = 1.

So K = ( (G * M_p) / (M_star^(2/3)) )^(1/3) ) * (1/( (M_star^(1/3) * P^(1/3) )) ) Hmm, maybe I'm getting ahead of myself.

Wait, the Doppler shift (K) is proportional to (M_p / M_star^(2/3)) ) * (1/( (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3) )) ), but since M_p is much smaller, it's roughly (M_p / M_star^(2/3)) ) * (1/(M_star^(1/3)) )) ? Wait no, perhaps I should recall the exact formula.

The RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star) )^(2/3) ) )^(1/3) * ( sin i ) / ( (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3) ) ) ] * (1/( (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) )

But for e=0, sin i=1, and M_p << M_star, this simplifies to:

K ≈ ( (G * M_p) )^(1/3) * ( 1 ) / ( M_star^(2/3) ) )

Wait, maybe another approach. The RV semi-amplitude K can be approximated as:

K = ( (27 * pi * G)^(1/3) ) * ( M_p sin i ) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) * (1 + M_p/M_star) )^(1/3) ) * (1/( P^(1/3) )) )

But I'm getting a bit stuck on the exact formula. Maybe I should remember that K is proportional to (M_p / M_star^(2/3)) ) * (1/( (1 + M_p/M_star )^(1/3) )) ) * (1/(P^(1/3)) )

Wait, perhaps I can relate the two K values for the two planets. Let me denote K1 for Planet1 and K2 for Planet2. The ratio K1/K2 would be (M1 sin i1) / (M2 sin i2) ) * ( (M_star)^(2/3) / (M_star)^(2/3) ) ) * ( (P1/P2) )^(1/3) )

Wait, no, perhaps more accurately, K is proportional to (M_p / M_star^(2/3)) ) * (1/( P^(1/3) ) )

Wait, no, because the period P comes into play through Kepler's third law. Kepler's third law says that P² = (4π²/G(M_star)) a³. So a³ = G M_star P²/(4π²). So a = [ G M_star P²/(4π²) ]^(1/3).

But I'm not sure if that's the way to go. Let's think about the radial velocity semi-amplitude formula again.

I found a formula online (but I can't look it up, but I remember it), K is given by:

K = [ (G * M_p * sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_p )^(2/3) ) ) ]^(1/3) * ( 1 / ( (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) )

But since M_p
