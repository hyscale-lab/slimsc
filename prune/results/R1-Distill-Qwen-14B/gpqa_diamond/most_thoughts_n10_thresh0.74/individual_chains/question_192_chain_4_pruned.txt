Okay, so I have this physics problem here about electric fields and conductors. Let me try to think through it step by step. 

The setup is an uncharged spherical conductor with a cavity inside. The conductor has radius R, and the cavity has radius r, which is smaller than R. The center of the cavity is a distance s away from the center of the conductor. So, imagine a big sphere and a smaller sphere inside it, not exactly at the center because s is the separation between their centers.

Then, a small positive charge +q is placed somewhere inside this cavity. The question is about finding the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor. Also, the distance from P to the cavity's center is l, and l and L are both larger than R. The angle between l and s is theta.

Hmm, I remember that conductors have some interesting properties regarding electric fields and charges. Since the conductor is uncharged, the total charge on it is zero. But when a charge is placed inside the cavity, things change. 

Wait, I think when a charge is placed inside a cavity of a conductor, the conductor's inner surface gets induced charges. But since the conductor itself was initially neutral, the inner surface would have an induced charge of equal magnitude but opposite sign. So, the inner surface must have -q, and the outer surface would have +q because the total conductor is neutral. Or wait, no. Wait, no, the conductor was initially uncharged, right? So, the charge inside the cavity would induce a charge on the inner surface of the conductor. Since the conductor is neutral, the inner surface must have -q, and then the outer surface would have +q to balance.

Wait, wait, let me think again. The conductor is neutral. When you put a positive charge +q inside the cavity, the cavity's walls (the inner surface of the conductor) must have an induced charge of -q. Because the conductor's material is a conductor, the charges will redistribute. So, the inner surface has -q, and since the conductor is neutral overall, the outer surface must have +q. Because the inner has -q, the total conductor is -q plus the outer's charge. So, to make the conductor neutral, the outer must be +q.

But wait, the point P is outside the conductor. So, the electric field at point P should be due to all the charges enclosed within the conductor. But wait, the conductor's own charges are inside, but the conductor's outer surface is at a potential where the field outside is as if the charge were a point charge at the center.

Wait, maybe I should recall Gauss's Law here. For a Gaussian surface outside the conductor, the enclosed charge would be the sum of the charge inside the cavity and the charge on the outer surface. But the conductor's total charge is zero, so the outer surface has +q. Wait no, the conductor's inner surface has -q, outer surface has +q. So the total charge enclosed by a Gaussian surface outside is +q (since the conductor's own charge is zero, but the inner has -q, outer has +q, so net is zero? Wait, no. Let me clarify.

The conductor is neutral. The charge inside the cavity is +q. The inner surface will have -q, so the conductor's remaining surface (the outer) must have +q
