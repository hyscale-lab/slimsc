Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. Let me read it carefully and try to understand what's being asked.

The setup is an uncharged spherical conductor with a radius R. Inside it, there's a small spherical cavity. The center of this cavity is a distance s away from the center of the conductor, and the radius of the cavity is r, which is smaller than R. So the conductor isn't just a hollow sphere; it's got this cavity somewhere off-center.

Now, a small positive charge +q is placed inside this cavity. The question is about finding the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is a distance L from the center of the conductor. Also, point P is at a distance l from the center of the cavity, and l and L are both greater than R. The angle between l and s is theta. 

Hmm, okay. So I need to figure out the electric field at point P which is outside the conductor.

Let me think about conductors and charges. When a conductor is uncharged, any internal charges are usually on the inner surface. But wait, in this case, the conductor is initially uncharged, but then a charge +q is placed inside the cavity. I remember that in such a scenario, the conductor's inner surface would have an induced charge equal in magnitude but opposite in sign. So the inner surface would have -q, and the outer surface would remain neutral since the total charge of the conductor is zero (it was uncharged before adding +q inside). Wait, noâ€”if the conductor was uncharged and then a charge +q is placed inside, then the inner surface would have -q induced, leaving the outer surface to have +q. Because the conductor's total charge would be the sum of inner and outer induced charges. Oh wait, no. Wait, the conductor itself starts neutral. When you place +q inside the cavity, the inner surface would have -q induced (because the cavity's charge attracts an opposite charge on the conductor's inner surface). But the conductor's total charge must stay zero. So the outer surface must have +q, because the inner is -q, so the outer is +q to balance it. Or wait, no, because the conductor is neutral overall. Let me think again: the conductor's total charge is zero. So the inner surface has -q, and the outer surface would have +q? Because the sum of inner and outer is
