Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is.

The problem says: A quantum mechanical particle of mass m moves in two dimensions in a potential V(r,θ) given by (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²(θ). We're supposed to find the energy spectrum from the given options.

Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, especially in two dimensions, the potential can sometimes be separable into radial and angular parts, which makes solving the Schrödinger equation easier. Let me try to break down this potential.

So the potential is V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ. Wait, I can factor out r², so V = r² [ (1/2)k + (3/2)k cos²θ ].

Hmm, this looks like a combination of a harmonic oscillator in the radial direction and another term that depends on θ. Wait, maybe it's a central potential plus something else. Let me think about it.

Wait, in polar coordinates, the kinetic energy is (p²)/(2m) where p is the momentum operator. But when you have a potential that's a function of r and θ, you might need to see if the system can be broken into radial and angular parts.

Wait, another approach: maybe this potential can be rewritten in terms of Cartesian coordinates. Because sometimes in 2D, using Cartesian coordinates can simplify things, especially if the potential looks like a sum of squares. Let me see.

Wait, cos²θ in polar coordinates can be expressed in Cartesian terms. I remember that cosθ = x/r, so cos²θ = x²/r². So putting that into the potential:

V(r, θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² (x²/r²) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k x².

But r² is x² + y², so substituting that in:

V = (1/2)k (x² + y²) + (3/2)k x².

Let me combine the terms. The x
