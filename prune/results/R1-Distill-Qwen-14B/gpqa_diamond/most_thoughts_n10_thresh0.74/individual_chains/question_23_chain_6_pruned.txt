Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it carefully.

The question says that a researcher reacted (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene with hydrogen bromide. Then, using TLC, they saw the reactant spot diminish, and two new spots appeared. I need to choose the correct products from the options given.

Hmm, okay. Let's break this down. First, the structure of the starting material. The compound is ((2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxy)benzene. Let me draw that mentally. So, the benzene ring has an ether group attached. The ether part is (but-3-en-1-yl) with substituents.

Wait, but-3-en-1-yl means there's a double bond between C3 and C4 (if we number from the oxygen). So, the structure is OCH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2? No, wait. Wait, but the substituents are on the 2nd carbon. So the butenyl group is CH2-CH(C(CH3)2)-CH2-CH2? Wait, maybe I should sketch it.

But wait, but-3-en-1-yl is CH2CH2CH=CH, but wait, that doesn't make sense. Let me think. The butenyl group is four carbons. The double bond is between carbons 3 and 4. So, the structure is: OCH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond? No, wait, but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2=CHCH2CH2O-. No, wait, but but-3-en-1-yl is CH2CH2CH=CH2, but that can't be right because but-3-en would be the third carbon. Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, but the substituents are 2,2-dimethyl. So the structure is: the oxygen is attached to the first carbon of the butenyl group. The butenyl group is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2? No, wait, 2,2-dimethyl means two methyl groups on the second carbon. So, the butenyl group is:

CH2-CH(CH3)2-CH2-CH2?

Wait, but that's but-1-enyl? No, wait, the position of the double bond. The but-3-en-1-yl is CH2-CH2-CH=CH2, with the double bond between C3 and C4. So, the structure would be OCH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond from C3 to C4? Wait, that's not possible because that would be a terminal double bond. Wait, no, but-3-en-1-yl is CH2-CH2-CH=CH2, but it's an ene group as a substituent. So the structure is OCH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4. Wait, so the structure would be OCH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with CH2=CH-CH2-CH
