Okay, so I've got this genetics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me start by reading through the question carefully.

So, there's this drought-resistant barley cultivar, but it has an anti-nutritional compound. The gene responsible for that compound has five exons and four introns. They used EMS mutagenesis to create mutants and are looking to eliminate the compound. The sequencing shows changes in the first exon area. The question is asking which mutation will probably let them get rid of the compound.

Hmm, right. So the gene's structure is important. Since the gene has exons and introns, any mutation in the exons could potentially affect the protein product, while intron mutations might not, unless it's a splicing issue. But the problem says the changes are in the first exon area, so that's where the mutations are.

The goal is to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. That suggests that the gene product is producing it, so we want to disrupt the gene's function. So, the mutations should disrupt the gene's ability to make the compound.

Looking at the sequences they provided. The intact gene is given, and then each mutant has a change somewhere. Let me look at each mutant.

Intact gene:
5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’
I'll note that the starting codon is ATG, which is methionine. So the gene likely encodes a protein.

Mutant 1:
5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Comparing to the intact, I think the change is in the third nucleotide. Let me see:

Original: TTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...
Mutant 1: TTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC...

Wait, let me count the letters. The original starts ATG T T T C T C G C T G G T A C T T C T G T G G A T G A A C A T A T T T A T T G T C G T …
Mutant 1: ATG T T C T A C G C T G G T A C T T C T G T G G A T G A A C A T A T T T A T T G T C G C … 

Wait, perhaps the change is in the first few codons. Let me look at the beginning.

Original first part: ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT
Mutant 1: ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC

Looking at the first few nucleotides:
Original: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT …
Mutant 1: ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC … 

Wait, so the first codon is same (ATG), second codon in original is TTT (Phe), in Mutant 1 it's TTC (Phe again). Third codon in original is CTC (Leu), in Mutant 1 it's TAC (Tyr). So the third codon changes from Leu to Tyr. So the amino acid at that position changes.

Wait, so the mutation is a point mutation. It changes a codon from CTC (Leu) to TAC (Tyr). So the protein will have a different amino acid there. But how does that affect the production of the anti-nutritional compound? Not sure yet. Let me check other mutations.

Mutant 2:
5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
