Okay, so I've got this question about a transmission electron microscope. Let me try to break it down.

So, Mike is working with a high-resolution TEM that's operating at 1000 kV. He's using vacuum pumps to get an ultra-high vacuum in the sample compartment, right? The pressure is less than 10^-9 Torr. The idea is to minimize gas molecules because if there's less gas, the electron beam won't scatter as much, leading to better images.

But even with all that pumping, there are still some gas particles left, as detected by a mass spectrometer. Mike measured the mean free path of these gas molecules as λ1. The mean free path is the average distance a molecule travels between collisions, right? So factors like pressure, temperature, and compartment volume would affect that.

Now, when Mike turns on the electron beam, he notices something interesting. The mean free path changes from λ1 to λ2. Hmm, why would that happen? The temperature is the same, so that's not it. Wait, when the electron beam is active, it's producing a lot of electrons. But how does that affect the gas?

I remember that in vacuum systems, when you have charged particles like electrons, they can cause gas molecules to be ionized. Or maybe the electrons are impacting the gas molecules, causing them to move or change state. Oh, right! The electron beam can cause gas molecules to either get ionized or become excited, making them charged. 

Charged particles in a vacuum are affected by electric fields. Since the electron microscope has an electric field from the accelerating voltage, these charged gas molecules would experience that field. They might be accelerated or deflected. But wait, the sample compartment is at high vacuum, but the gas is still there. If the gas molecules become charged, their mean free path would change because they can interact differently with the surrounding. 

Wait, another angle: The mean free path λ is given by the formula λ = 1/(nσ), where n is the number density of gas molecules and σ is the collision cross-section. But when the electron beam is on, maybe the gas molecules are getting more collisions because they're more energetic, or because the electrons are causing more scattering?

Wait, no, actually, when the gas molecules are neutral, their mean free path is λ1. But when the electron beam is on, the electrons can ionize the gas. So, the gas molecules become ions (charged). Charged particles in a vacuum have a different behavior. They can be attracted or repelled by the electric fields in the microscope. 

In particular, charged gas ions can be accelerated towards the anode or other parts of the microscope, which might cause them to leave the sample compartment. But wait, the sample is in the compartment, so the ions could be getting removed because the electric field is strong enough to pull them out. That would reduce the number of gas molecules in the compartment when the beam is on.

If the number of gas molecules decreases when the beam is on, then the number density n would decrease. Because mean free path λ is inversely proportional to n, if n goes down, λ increases. So, λ2 would be larger than λ1. 

Wait, but wait another thought. The mean free path in a vacuum is determined by the pressure (which relates to n), temperature, and the cross-section. If the gas becomes ionized, the cross-section might
