Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I need to figure it out. Let's see, the question is about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, I remember that the RV method detects planets by looking at the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum as the planet's gravity causes the star to wobble.

The setup is that two stars have the same mass, both similar to the Sun. Each has a planet with mass similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. The question is about the orbital periods of the two planets.

So, the data given is the periodic shift in the spectral lines. Planet #1's shift is 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2's is 7. The question is how many times longer is the orbital period of Planet #2 compared to Planet #1.

Wait, I think the RV method relates the velocity of the star to the mass of the planet. The formula I remember is something like v = (G * M_p * sin i) / (M_star * (1 + M_p/M_star))^(1/3) ) * (1 / (P * (1 - e²)^(3/2)) ) ), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the velocity semi-amplitude K is given by K = (v) which depends on the planet's mass, the star's mass, and the orbital period.

Another approach: I remember that the RV method gives the velocity semi-amplitude, which depends on the planet's mass, the orbital period, the inclination angle, and the mass of the star. But since both stars have the same mass and planets similar masses, maybe the inclination is the same for both (or perhaps it's not given, so I can assume that sin i is the same for both, maybe i is 90 degrees, so sin i is 1).

Wait, but the problem states that the same spectral line's shift is given. So the RV semi-amplitude K is proportional to the star's velocity. What's the formula for K?

I think the formula for K is K = ( (G * (M_p) * sin i) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) * P^(1/3) ) ) ) * (1/(2π)) )^(1/3) ?

Wait, maybe another way. Let me think about the formula. I think the formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) is
