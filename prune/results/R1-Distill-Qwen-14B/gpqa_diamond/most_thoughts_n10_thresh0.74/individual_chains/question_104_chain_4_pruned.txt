Okay, so I've got this astronomy question about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I remember that the radial velocity method detects planets by observing the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum as it moves due to the planet's gravity. So when the star moves towards us, the spectral lines shift blue, and when it moves away, they shift red. The periodic shifts tell us about the planet's orbit.

The question says two stars with the same mass, each having a planet with Neptune-like mass. Both planets are in circular orbits. The RV method detected shifts in the spectral lines: planet #1 caused a shift of up to 5 milliangstroms, and planet #2 caused a shift of 7 milliangstroms. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1.

Wait, I think the key here is the relationship between the Doppler shift (the velocity) and the properties of the planet. The radial velocity semi-amplitude K is related to the planet's mass and the orbital period. But I need to recall the exact formula.

I remember that the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by the formula:

K = [ (G * (M_planet) ) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) ) ) ]^(1/3) * (1 / (P * (1 - e²)^(0.5)) )^(1/3) )

Wait, no, maybe that's not exactly right. Alternatively, I think the formula that relates K to the orbital period, mass, and other factors is part of the Keplerian equations.

Another approach: The RV method measures the velocity of the star, which is related to the mass of the planet and the orbital period. The formula for the semi-amplitude K is:

K = (v) = ( (G * P) / (2 * π * c) )^(1/3) * ( (M_planet * sin i) / (M_star^(2/3)) ) )

Wait, maybe that's not precise. Let me think again. I remember that the velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ (27 * π * G ) / (8 * c^3) ) ]^(1/3) * ( M_planet * sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) ) ) * (1 / P )^(1/
