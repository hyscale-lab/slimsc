Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question says: Racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene is treated with Grubbs catalyst. How many possible products are there, excluding ethene?

Hmm, I remember that Grubbs catalyst is used in olefin metathesis reactions. Metathesis is when you break and reform carbon-carbon double bonds, right? Grubbs is a transition metal catalyst, usually used for ring-closing metathesis or cross metathesis. It's also involved in breaking and exchanging alkene parts.

So, the starting material is racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Wait, racemic means it's a 50-50 mix of enantiomers. But wait, for alkenes, if they are chiral, the configuration will influence the product, but maybe in metathesis, the stereochemistry might not matter as much depending on the reaction.

Let me draw the structure of 3-methylpent-1-ene. Pent-1-ene has 5 carbons with a double bond starting at C1. So, structure is CH2=CHCH(CH2CH3)-? No, wait, wait. Wait, pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. But wait, 3-methylpent-1-ene would have a methyl branch on C3. Let me number the carbons:

Carbon 1: CH2-
Carbon 2: CH-
Carbon 3: CH(CH3)-
Carbon 4: CH2-
Carbon 5: CH3?

Wait, maybe not. Let's think again. Pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. So, adding a methyl group on carbon 3 would make it CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Wait, but that would make it 3-methylpent-1-ene. So the structure is CH₂=CH–CH(CH₃)–CH₂–CH₃? Hmm, is that correct?

Wait, wait, no. Wait, pent-1-ene is CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH₃. So, 3-methyl would be at the third carbon, which is the middle CH₂. So, adding a methyl group on C3 would make it CH₂=CH–CH(CH3)–CH₂–CH3? Wait, but that structure is a
