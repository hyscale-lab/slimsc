Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy question. Let me read through it again and make sure I understand what's being asked.

Alright, the question is about three exoplanets: Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3. They're using the TTV method, which I think stands for Transit Timing Variation. But maybe that's not super relevant here. The main points are the ratios of their equilibrium temperatures and masses, and I need to find out by what factor the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than Planet1's. All have the same albedo, 0.3, like Earth.

So, the given data is:
- Temperature ratio Planet1/Planet2 ≈ 1.4. Wait, that would mean Planet1 is hotter than Planet2? Or is it the other way around? Wait, the ratio is Planet1 to Planet2, so T1/T2 = 1.4. So Planet1 is hotter.
- Temperature ratio Planet2/Planet3 ≈ 2.3. So T2 is 2.3 times Planet3's temperature. So Planet3 is cooler than Planet2, and thus, since Planet2 is cooler than Planet1, Planet3 is the coolest.

Mass ratios:
- Planet1/Planet2 ≈1.15. So Planet1 is a bit more massive than Planet2.
- Planet2/Planet3 ≈1.35, so Planet2 is more massive than Planet3.

We need the factor by which Planet3's orbital period is larger than Planet1's.

Hmm, orbital period relates to the planet's distance from the star and the star's mass. But since the star's mass isn't given, I assume it's the same for all planets, which is a reasonable assumption because they're part of the same system.

The formula for equilibrium temperature is T = [(L(1 - a))/(16πσ D²)]^(1/4), where L is the star's luminosity, a is albedo, σ is Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and D is the planet's orbital distance.

But since all planets have the same albedo (0.3), and the star is the same, the equilibrium temperature depends on the square root of the distance. Wait, equilibrium temperature formula: T ∝ (L/(D²))^(1/4) because L is the star's luminosity. So T is proportional to D^(-1/2).

So, T1/T2 = (D2/D1)^(-1/2) → because T is inversely proportional to D^½.

Wait, let me write it mathematically. Let me denote the equilibrium temperature of planet i as Ti. Then Ti = ( (L (1 - a_i)) / (16 π σ D_i²) )^(1/4).

Since albedo a_i is the same for all (0.3), and L is same for all, then Ti ∝ D_i^(-1/2).

So, T1/T2 = (D2/D1)^(−1/2). Rearranging, D2/D1 = (T1/T2)^(-2) → D2/D1 = (1.4)^(-2).

Similarly, T2/T3 = (D3/D2)^(−1/2). So D3/D2 = (T2/T3)^(-2) → T2/T3 is 2.3, so D3/D2 = (2.3)^(-2).

Wait, no, let's clarify. Let's correct the exponents. Let me think again.

If Ti ∝ D_i^(-1/2), then (Ti / Tj) = (Dj / Di)^(1/2).

Wait, let me verify: If D increases, T decreases because T is inversely proportional to D^½. So for D_i = 2 D_j, T_i is (1/√2) T_j.

So, if T_i / T_j = (D_j / D_i)^(1/2). So T_i = T_j * sqrt(D_j/D_i).

So, for Planet1 and Planet2: T1 / T2
