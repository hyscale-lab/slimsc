Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because it's about pH calculations, which I know can get tricky. But I'll try to walk through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The problem says: Determine the pH of the solution made by mixing 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH, 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, and 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2. The options are A to D.

Hmm. So, I remember that when you mix acids and bases, you have to consider the neutralization reactions. Since there are multiple acids and a base here, I think the first step is to figure out the total moles of H+ and OH- ions contributed by each solution. Then, see if they neutralize each other, and calculate the excess after neutralization. After that, if there's more acid or base left, use that to find the pH.

Wait, let me think. CH3COOH is a weak acid, HCl is a strong acid, and Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. So, the strong acid and strong base will dissociate completely, but the acetic acid won't. But when you mix them all together, the H+ from the acids will react with the OH- from the base.

Let me break it down. First, I'll calculate the moles of each component.

Starting with CH3COOH: it's 0.1 M in 500 mL. Moles = Molarity Ã— Volume (in liters). So 0.1 * 0.5 = 0.05 moles.

HCl: 0.2 M in 400 mL. 0.2 * 0.4 = 0.08 moles. Since HCl is a strong acid, it will donate 0.08 moles of H+.

Ba(OH)2: 0.3 M in 300 mL. 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles. But Ba(OH)2 dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2 OH^- ions. So each mole gives 2 moles of OH-. So moles of OH- here would be 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

Now, let's sum up the H+ and OH- contributions.

Total H+ comes from CH3COOH and HCl. But wait, CH3COOH is a weak acid, so it doesn't fully dissociate. However, in the presence of a strong acid like HCl and a strong base, some reactions will happen. Hmm, maybe I should consider the neutralization first.

Wait, no. Let me think this through again. When you mix all three solutions, the H+ from HCl and CH3COOH will react with OH- from Ba(OH)2. So, the OH- will first neutralize the H+ from the acids.

So, first, calculate the total H+ from all acidic sources. That's the H+ from CH3COOH and HCl. But wait, CH3COOH is a weak acid, so it doesn't contribute as much H+ as a strong acid. But wait, in this scenario, when you have a solution with both strong and weak acids, and a strong base, the base will react with all the available H+.

Wait a minute, perhaps I should calculate all the H+ and OH- contributions, see which is in excess, and then proceed.

Wait, let me calculate the total H+ from all sources before considering neutralization.

Wait, no. Because HCl is a strong acid, it will donate all its H+ ions, so that's 0.08 moles of H+. CH3COOH, being a weak acid, doesn't donate all its H+. But when mixed with a strong base, the base's OH- will react with the H+ from the acids.

Wait, perhaps the approach is:

1. Calculate moles of H+ from all sources (both strong and weak acids) and moles of OH- from the base.
2. Subtract OH- from H+ to find the net H+ or OH-.
3. Then, based on which is in excess, compute the pH.

Wait, but wait. CH3COOH is an acid, so it contributes H+ ions. HCl is a strong acid, so it contributes H+ fully. The Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so it contributes OH- fully.

So, total H+ is (moles from CH3COOH) + (moles from HCl). But wait, wait, no. Wait, CH3COOH is a weak acid, so it doesn't release all its H+ ions. Or does it? Wait, but when you have a solution that's a mixture of acids and a base, the strong acid's H+ will be available, and the weak acid's H+ will not be fully available?

Wait
