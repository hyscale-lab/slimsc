Okay, so I need to figure out the scalar and vector potentials for a moving charge. Hmm, I remember from my electromagnetism class that when charges are moving, you have to consider both the electric and magnetic fields, which are related to the scalar and vector potentials.

The question gives me a point charge q moving with some trajectory s(t). The field is observed at point r, and d is the vector from where the field was generated (at time tr) to the observation point r. Oh right, tr is the time when the field was generated, and t is the current time, with t > tr.

I think the scalar potential V and vector potential A are based on the retarded time concept because the fields are due to the charge's position and velocity at an earlier time. Wait, so the charge's position at time tr is s(tr), and the vector d is from s(tr) to r. So d is r - s(tr), right?

The velocity at the field generating instant is v. So, the charge is moving, and its velocity at time tr is v. How does this affect the potentials?

I recall that the scalar potential V for a moving charge isn't just the same as a static charge. Oh wait, no, wait. The scalar potential is (q)/(4πε0) times 1 over the distance, but that's when the charge is static. But when the charge is moving, maybe it's not that simple. Or wait, no, because the scalar potential in the static case is q/(4πε0 r), but when the charge is moving, does it change?

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the potentials' expressions from the retarded time. So the potentials are functions of the charge's position and velocity at the retarded time.

I remember that the scalar potential due to a moving charge is given by V = (q)/(4πε0) [ (1/r') + (v·d)/(c² r') ]^-1 or something like that. Wait, no, perhaps I should think about the exact expressions.

The scalar potential is (q/(4πε0)) * [1/(d·c + ...)]. Wait, no, I think it's V = (q)/(4πε0) * (1/(d c + (d·v)) ) or something along those lines. Wait, I might be mixing things up.
