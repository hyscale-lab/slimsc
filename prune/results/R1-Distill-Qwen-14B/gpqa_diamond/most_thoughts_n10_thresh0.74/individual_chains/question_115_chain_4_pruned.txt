Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it again carefully.

An electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. A positron is also moving along the horizontal axis but from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. After colliding, both annihilate and produce two photons. The photons have the same energy, and their directions are one upper-right and the other lower-right. I need to find the angle between them.

Hmm, right. So, let's break this down. First, I remember that when particles like electrons and positrons annihilate, they produce photons. Since they're moving towards each other, this is a head-on collision. The conservation laws—momentum and energy—must apply here.

Wait, but the electron and positron have equal and opposite charges. The positron is the antimatter counterpart of the electron. So when they collide, they annihilate into two photons. I remember that in such cases, the photons must move in opposite directions to conserve momentum, but wait, wait, that's not the case here. Because the initial particles are moving along the same line but towards each other, so their momenta are opposite. Let me think.

Wait, the problem says that both the electron and positron are moving along the horizontal axis. So the positron is moving from the right, meaning towards the left, perhaps. Wait, the electron is moving from the left, so to the right. The positron is moving from the right, so to the left. So their velocities are in opposite directions.

Now, considering their Lorentz factors. The electron has a gamma of 4, and the positron a gamma of 2. So gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). But perhaps more useful here is that the energy of each particle is gamma * m * c², and the momentum is gamma * m * v. But since v can be expressed in terms of beta, which is v/c, perhaps it's better to compute beta for each.

Wait, let's compute their momenta. The electron's momentum (p_e) is gamma_e * m_e * v_e. Similarly for the positron (p_p) = gamma_p * m_p * v_p. But wait, since the positron is moving in the opposite direction, perhaps we should take its momentum as negative.

Wait, but the positron has
