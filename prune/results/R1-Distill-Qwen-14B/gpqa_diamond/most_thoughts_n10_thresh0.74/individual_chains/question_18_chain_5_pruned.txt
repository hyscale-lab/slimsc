Okay, so I have this problem about stellar abundances and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's start by reading the question carefully.

The question is about two stars, Star_1 and Star_2, each with masses 1.5 and 1.2 times that of the Sun. They've determined the elemental abundances using the EW method, assuming LTE. The given values are [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex, [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex, [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex, and [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex.

We're given the Sun's photospheric composition: 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 and 12 + log10(nMg/nH) = 7. We need to find the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2.

Hmm, right, so the question is asking for [Si] ratio between the two stars. Let's recall what these abundance notations mean.

The notation [X/Y] is the logarithm of the ratio of the abundance of element X to element Y relative to the Sun. So, [X/Y] = log10(nX/nY) - log10(nX/nY)_sun.

But wait, more accurately, [X/Y] = log10( (nX/nY)_star / (nX/nY)_sun ). So if [X/Y] is positive, X is more abundant relative to Y than in the Sun.

First, let's handle Star_1. For Star_1, [Si/Fe] is 0.3. So that means (nSi/nFe)_1 / (nSi/nFe)_sun = 10^0.3 ≈ 2. So nSi/nFe for Star_1 is about 2 times that of the Sun.

But wait, the Sun's [Fe/H] is given as 0 for Star_1. [Fe/H] is the logarithm of (nFe/nH)_star / (nFe/nH)_sun. Since [Fe/H]_1 is 0, that means (nFe/nH)_1 = (nFe/nH)_sun. So Fe abundance is the same as the Sun's.

Wait, but the Sun's 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5. So 12 is a constant, and the log10 part is 7.5 - 12 = -4.5? Wait no, wait the notation is a bit confusing. Let me parse it correctly.

The Sun's photospheric composition is given as 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5. So rearranged, log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5. So log10(nFe/nH)_sun = -4.5. Therefore, nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5) ≈ 3.16e-5.

Similarly, for Mg, it's 12 + log10(nMg/nH) =7. So log10(nMg/nH)_sun =7 -12 = -5. So nMg/nH_sun = 1e-5.

Wait, but for each star, [Fe/H]_1 is 0. So (nFe_1/nH_1) = (nFe_sun/nH_sun). So nFe_1 = nFe_sun * (nH_1/nH_sun). Wait, no, because [Fe/H] is log(nFe/nH) - log(nFe_sun/nH_sun) =0. So log(nFe_1/nH_1) = log(nFe_sun/nH_sun). Thus, nFe_1/nH_1 = nFe_sun/nH_sun. Therefore, the ratio nFe_1/nH_1 is the same as the Sun's. So, for Star_
