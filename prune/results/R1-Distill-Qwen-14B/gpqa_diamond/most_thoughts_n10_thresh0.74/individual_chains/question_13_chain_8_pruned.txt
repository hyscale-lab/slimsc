Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question carefully.

The starting material is (R)-(+)-Limonene. I remember that limonene is a cyclic monoterpene, and (R) configuration means it's the more common form found in citrus peels, like oranges. Limonene has a structure with a cyclohexene ring with a methyl group and an isopropyl group attached. Wait, no, maybe it's a bicyclic structure? No, I think limonene is a bicyclic monoterpene, but wait, maybe not. Oh right, limonene is a cyclic monoterpene, specifically a bicyclic structure with a six-membered ring, but wait, no, I think limonene is actually a bicyclic monoterpene, but actually, no, wait, limonene is a cyclic monoterpene, but I'm getting a bit mixed up. Let me get that straight. 

Wait, limonene's structure is a bicyclic monoterpene with a specific configuration. The structure is a six-membered ring with one double bond, and substituents. Specifically, it's a bicyclic monoterpene with a specific configuration; (R) configuration. So, the structure is a bicyclic compound with a double bond, and the substituents are a methyl group and an isopropyl group or something like that.

Wait, I think limonene is a bicyclic monoterpene, specifically a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene structure. So, the structure is a norbornene derivative. The double bond is between carbons 1 and 2, and there are substituents on carbons 1 and 2 as well. Wait, no, maybe the substituents are in different positions. For (R)-limonene, the configuration is such that there's a methyl group and an isopropyl group attached.

Wait, perhaps it's better to draw the structure mentally. Limonene has a structure where there's a cyclohexene ring with a substituent. Alternatively, it's a bicyclic structure. Hmm, wait, I think limonene is a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene, also known as norbornene. The structure has a five-membered ring with substituents. Let me get this right. The norbornene structure has a bridged bicyclic system, with a double bond. So, it's bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene. So, the substituents are on carbons 1 and 2.

Wait, but for (R)-limonene, I think the substituents are an isopropyl group and a methyl group. So, the structure has a bicyclo system, with substituents on the bridgeheads.

Now, the first step: the solution is a methanol solution of (R)-limonene, stirred with Pd/C under hydrogen. So, this setup looks like a hydrogenation reaction. Pd/C is a catalyst for hydrogenation, especially for alkenes. So, limonene has a double bond, and it's being hydrogenated. 

But wait, the problem says after 1 equivalent of hydrogen is consumed, product 1 is isolated as
