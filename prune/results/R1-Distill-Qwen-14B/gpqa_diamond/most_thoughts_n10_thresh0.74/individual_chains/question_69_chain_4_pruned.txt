Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about particle decay in the CERN Bubble Chamber. Hmm, let me read the question again.

The particle X⁰ decays into Y⁺ and Z⁻ with a proper lifetime τ₀ of 8e-16 seconds. The question is about finding the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. The energy in the chamber is 27 GeV, and the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV. The options are A to D with different resolutions.

Wait, I remember that when particles decay, their lifetime as observed in the lab frame is longer due to time dilation. The proper lifetime is the lifetime measured in the particle's rest frame. Oh right, the formula for time dilation is τ = γ τ₀, where γ is the Lorentz factor. But wait, how does this relate to the distance they travel before decaying?

Oh right, the distance L that the particle travels before decaying is L = v * τ. But since τ is γ τ₀, then L = v γ τ₀. Alternatively, since velocity v is a significant fraction of c, perhaps we can approximate it as L ≈ c * γ τ₀.

But wait, without knowing the velocity, perhaps we can find γ using the energy and mass. Energy E is given as 27 GeV. The mass is 3.41 GeV. So the total energy E is related to gamma by E = γ m c². Okay, so gamma would be E/(m c²). Since E is given in GeV and m is in GeV/c², the units would work out because c² is accounted for in the mass term.

Let me compute gamma. So E is 27 GeV, m c² is 3.41 GeV. So gamma is 27 / 3.41. Let me calculate that: 27 divided by 3.41. Hmm, 3.41 times 7 is 23.87, 3.41 times 8 is 27.28, which is a bit more. So 27 is about 27.28 when multiplied by 8, so 27/3.41 is approximately 7.918, let's say roughly 7.92.

So gamma is approximately 7.92. Then, the lifetime observed in the lab frame is τ = γ τ₀. So τ = 7.92 * 8e-16 s. Let me compute that: 7.92 *8 = 63.36, so τ ≈63.36e-16 s, or 6.336e-15 seconds.

Wait, but wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me double-check the calculation. 27 divided by 3.41. Let me do it more precisely.

3.41 × 7 = 23.87. 27 -23.87= 3.13. 3.13 / 3.41 ≈0.917. So total is approximately 7.917, yeah around 7.92.

So the lifetime τ is 7.92 * 8e-16=63.36e-16=6.336e-15 seconds.

So the average path length L is c multiplied by τ. The speed of light c is approximately 3e8 m/s.

So L = c * τ = 3e8 m/s * 6.336e-15 s.

Let me calculate that: 3e8 *6.336e-15 = (3 *6.336) *e^(8-15) = 18.999e-7 meters.

Wait, 3e8 is 3 *1e8, 6.336e-15 is 6.336 *1e-15. So
