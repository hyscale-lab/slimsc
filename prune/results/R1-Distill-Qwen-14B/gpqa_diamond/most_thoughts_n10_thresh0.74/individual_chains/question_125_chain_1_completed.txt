Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem. Let me read it again.

The question is about a particle in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential. The potential is given as V(r) = (1/2) m ω² r². So, this is the Hooke's law potential. I remember that in 3D, the harmonic oscillator has energy levels that depend on the quantum numbers in each dimension. 

The question asks about the energy of the third excited state and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for that energy. The options are A, B, C, D.

Hmm. Let's break it down. For a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are determined by the sum of the quantum numbers in each direction. I think the energy formula is E = (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) ħω. Wait, no, wait. Wait, in 3D, the energy levels are given by E = (n + 3/2) ħω, where n is the total quantum number. Oh wait, wait, no. I think each dimension contributes n_i, so n = n_x + n_y + n_z. So, E = (n + 3/2) ħω, where n = n_x + n_y + n_z, and each n_i is a non-negative integer (0,1,2,...).

Wait, I remember that the ground state is n=0, which would be (3/2) ħω. The first excited state would have n=1, so (5/2) ħω, then n=2 is (7/2) ħω, and the third excited state would be n=3, leading to (9/2) ħω. So that would match one of the options.

Wait, wait, but wait—what's the order of the excited states? The ground state is the lowest, then first excited is next, etc. So for n=0, it's ground. Then, n=1 is first excited, n=2 is second, and n=3 is third. So the third excited state has n=3, energy (3 + 3/2) ħω = (9/2) ħω. So that part is clear.

Now, the second part: how many eigenfunctions are possible for the same energy eigenvalue. So, for a given n, how many distinct states are there, considering different combinations of n_x, n_y, n_z that sum to n=3.

Right, so we need to find the number of non-negative integer solutions to n_x + n_y + n_z = 3. Oh, this is a combinatorics problem. The number of ways to distribute 3 quanta among 3 dimensions.

The number of solutions is given by the combination formula C(n + k -1, k-1), where n is the number to distribute and k is the number of variables. So here, n=3, k=3. So C(3+3-1, 3-1) = C(5,2) = 10. So 10 possible states, each with different (n_x, n_y, n_z) combinations.

So the energy is (9/2) ħω, and the number of eigenfunctions is 10. Looking at the options, option A says (9/2) ħω and 10. So that's correct.

Wait, let me check the options again. Option A is (9/2) ħω, 10. Option C is same energy, but 3 functions. So no, the correct number is 10, not 3. So the answer should be A.

Wait, but wait. Another possible confusion: sometimes people count the degeneracy as the number of ways, which for n=3, it is indeed 10. So yeah, I think option A is correct.


The problem involves a particle in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential, where the energy levels are determined by the quantum numbers \( n_x, n_y, n_z \) in each spatial dimension. The energy of the system is given by:

\[
E = \left(n + \frac{3}{2}\right)\hbar\omega,
\]

where \( n = n_x + n_y + n_z \) is the total quantum number. The ground state corresponds to \( n = 0 \), the first excited state to \( n = 1 \), the second excited state to \( n = 2 \), and the third excited state to \( n = 3 \). For \( n = 3 \), the energy is:

\[
E = \left(3 + \frac{3}{2}\right)\hbar\omega = \frac{9}{2}\hbar\omega.
\]

Next, the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions corresponding to the same energy eigenvalue is determined by the number of non-negative integer solutions to \( n_x + n_y + n_z = 3 \). This is a combinatorial problem, and the number of solutions is given by:

\[
\binom{n + k - 1}{k - 1},
\]

where \( n = 3 \) is the total number of quanta, and \( k = 3 \) is the number of dimensions. Substituting these values:

\[
\binom{3 + 3 - 1}{3 - 1} = \binom{5}{2} = 10.
\]

Thus, there are 10 linearly independent eigenfunctions for the third excited state. Comparing this result with the options provided, the correct choice is:

**Energy: \( \frac{9}{2}\hbar\omega \), Number of eigenfunctions: 10.**
