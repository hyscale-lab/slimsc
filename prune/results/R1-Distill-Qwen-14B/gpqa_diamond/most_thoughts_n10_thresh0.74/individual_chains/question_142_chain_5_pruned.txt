Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure out where the given density matrix is located in the qubit space. Let me think through this step by step.

The density matrix given is ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). Hmm, I remember that density matrices represent the state of a quantum system, including mixed states. Each density matrix is a square matrix of size N x N for an N-dimensional system.

Wait, qubits are two-dimensional, right? So this is a 2x2 density matrix. The options given are vectors in 3D space, so maybe they're referring to the Bloch sphere representation. Oh right, the Bloch sphere is a way to represent qubit states, where pure states are on the surface and mixed states are inside.

I think for a pure state, the density matrix is a projector, like |ψ⟩⟨ψ|. For example, |0⟩⟨0| would correspond to the point (1,0,0) on the Bloch sphere. Similarly, |1⟩⟨1| would be (0,0,1).

But this ρ isn't a pure state. It's a mixture of |0⟩⟨0| and |1⟩⟨1| with equal weights. Wait, let me compute ρ explicitly. 

Each term |0⟩⟨0| is a matrix [[1,0],[0,0]], and |1⟩⟨1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. Adding them together gives [[1,0],[0,1]], which is the identity matrix I. So ρ is (1/2) * I. So ρ equals [[1/2, 0], [0, 1/2]].

Wait, but when is a density matrix in the form of a scalar multiple of the identity matrix? That's the maximally mixed state, right? Because it's (I/2) for a qubit. Maximal mixing implies it's as far from pure as possible, which would be at the center of the Bloch sphere.

The Bloch sphere is a unit sphere, so the center is at the origin. So the point would be (0,0,0). Looking at the options, option C is (0,0,0), so that must be the answer.

Wait, let me double-check. The general form for a qubit state on the Bloch sphere is
