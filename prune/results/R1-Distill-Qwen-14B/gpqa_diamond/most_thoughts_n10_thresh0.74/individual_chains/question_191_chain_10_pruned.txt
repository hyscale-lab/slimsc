Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here. It's a bit complex, but let's try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll do my best.

The starting material is 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. Hmm, let me visualize that structure. So, the cyclohexanone ring has substituents at positions 3 and 5. Position 3 has a hydroxymethyl group (-CH2OH), and position 5 has a prop-1-en-2-yl group. Prop-1-en-2-yl is like an allyl group attached at the 2nd carbon, right? So it's CH2-C(CH2)-CH2, but wait, the structure is actually CH2-C=CH2, but wait, the prop-1-en-2-yl group is CH2-CH(CH2) with a double bond? Wait, prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2=CH-CH2- group, but I'm getting confused. No, wait, propene is CH2=CHCH3. So prop-1-en-2-yl would be the substituent where the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the substituent is on C2. So it's CH2-C(=CH2)-, but wait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, no, the structure of prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2=C-CH2-, but that can't be right because propene is CH2=CHCH3, so the substituent comes from the middle carbon. So, maybe it's CH(CH2) attached with a double bond. Alternatively, perhaps it's an allyl group attached at the middle carbon. So, maybe the structure is CH2=C-CH2-, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should think of it as an isopropenyl group. Wait, prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2-C=CH2? That doesn't make sense because that's a three-carbon chain, but the substituent on the middle carbon would be the point of attachment. So, perhaps the group is CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C1 and C2? No, that's not right. Wait, prop-1-en-2-yl
