Alright, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure out the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) when a certain nucleus is moving at 0.96 times the speed of light. Hmm, okay, let's break this down.

First off, the nucleus in question is X, which is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium. Oh right, lithium has an atomic number of 3. So if it has 3 neutrons, the mass number A is protons plus neutrons. So protons in lithium are 3, so 3 +3 =6. So X is Li-6. So the mass number is 6. Got it. So that means the mass of the nucleus is approximately 6 times the mass of a proton, I think. Because each nucleon (proton or neutron) has about the same mass.

So the problem is about calculating the kinetic energy or the total energy of the nucleus when it's moving at 0.96c. Oh wait, the question says the energy of the collider, so I think that refers to the total energy of the nucleus. Because RHIC accelerates heavy ions to high energies, and the energy they have when moving at that speed is the one we're looking for.

So I need to compute the energy using the relativistic energy formula. The formula for total energy is gamma multiplied by the rest mass energy. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1 divided by the square root of (1 minus v squared over c squared). Since v is 0.96c, I can plug that in.

Let me write down the variables:

v = 0.96c

So beta (β) is v/c = 0.96

Gamma (γ) is 1 / sqrt(1 - β²)

Let me calculate gamma first. So beta squared is 0.96^2. Let's compute that: 0.96 * 0.96. Hmm, 0.96^2 = (1 - 0.04)^2 = 1 - 0.08 + 0.0016 = 0.9216. So 1 - beta squared is 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is sqrt(0.0784). Wait, what's that? 0.0784 is 784e-4, so sqrt(784e-4) is 28e-2, which is 0.28. So gamma is 1 / 0.28 = approximately 3.5714. Hmm, wait, let me double-check that sqrt calculation. Alternatively, 0.28 squared is 0.0784, yes. So gamma is 1 / 0.28, which is about 3.5714.

Wait, but wait, 0.28 is 28/100, which is 7/25. So 1/(7/25) is 25/7 ≈ 3.5714. Right.

Now, the rest mass energy of the nucleus. The nucleus is Li-6, so its mass is approximately 6 times the mass of a proton. Wait, but neutrons and protons have almost the same mass. So the mass of Li-6 is about 6 * m_p, where m_p is the proton mass.

But wait, actually, the exact mass of a nucleus is a bit more involved. Because each nucleon contributes a mass, but the binding energy also affects the total mass. But for heavy ions in high-energy physics, the mass of the nucleus is often approximated as A * m_p, where A is the mass number. So I'll proceed with that.

So the rest energy is m * c². Let me find the rest mass of Li-6. The mass of a proton is approximately 938 MeV/c². So
