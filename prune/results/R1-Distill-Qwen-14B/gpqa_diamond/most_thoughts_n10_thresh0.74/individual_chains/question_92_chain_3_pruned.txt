Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. Let me read it again.

The question is about calculating the enthalpy of formation of a specific organic compound. The compound given is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. Hmm, that looks a bit complicated, but I think I can break it down.

The data provided includes the enthalpy of atomization of carbon as 1000 kJ/mol. Then there are bond energies for various bonds: H-H is 100 kJ/mol, C-C is 200, C=C is 300, and C-H is 400. 

Wait, I remember that the enthalpy of formation is calculated using bond energies. The general approach is to calculate the total energy of the bonds broken in the reactants and the bonds formed in the products. Oh right, the formula is usually: Enthalpy of reaction (ΔH) = Σ (bonds broken) - Σ (bonds formed).

But wait, for enthalpy of formation, I think it's a bit different. The standard approach is to calculate the energy required to form the molecule from its constituent elements in their standard states. So, for a hydrocarbon, that would mean breaking down the molecule into C and H atoms. 

So the idea is to calculate the sum of the bond energies in the molecule and then subtract that from the enthalpy of atomization multiplied by the number of atoms. Or wait, maybe it's the other way around. Let me think.

The enthalpy of formation of a molecule can be calculated using the formula: 

ΔHf = (sum of bond energies in reactants) - (sum of bond energies in products)

Wait, no, that's for reactions. For formation, maybe it's the sum of the bond energies that are broken to form the molecule minus the bond energies that are formed. Or perhaps it's the opposite: the sum of the bond energies in the molecule subtracted from the energy of the elements in their atomic form.

Wait, another way to think about it: The enthalpy of formation is the energy change when 1 mole of the compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. So, for a hydrocarbon like this, which is composed of C and H, we can model it as breaking all the bonds in the compound and then forming C-H, C-C, and C=C bonds as needed.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me recall the method. The standard enthalpy of formation can be calculated using the bond energies. The formula is:

ΔH°f = [Σ (Bond energies of reactants)] - [Σ (Bond energies of products)]

But wait, in this case, the reactants would be the elements in their standard states, which are H2 and C ( graphite maybe). The products are the bonds in the molecule.

Wait, so perhaps the approach is:

1. Calculate the energy required to break all the bonds in the molecule (sum of all bond energies in the molecule).
2. Then, calculate the energy released when forming the bonds from the elements (sum of the bond energies of the elements, which here are H-H and C-C bonds, but wait, carbon is in its atomic form. Oh, wait, the enthalpy of atomization is given as 1000 kJ/mol for carbon. So each C atom in the molecule comes from breaking a C-C bond in graphite, perhaps.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the enthalpy of atomization. The enthalpy of atomization is the energy required to break a mole of a substance into its constituent atoms. For carbon, that's 1000 kJ/mol. So each C atom in the molecule comes from C(s) → C(g) with ΔH = 1000 kJ/mol.

Similarly, hydrogen's bond energy is given. So for H2, each bond is 100 kJ/mol. So to break H2 into 2 H atoms, it's 100 kJ per mole of H2.

So the general approach is:

The enthalpy of formation is the sum of the energies required to break
