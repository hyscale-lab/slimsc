Okay, so I've got this question about transmission electron microscopy and mean free paths of gas molecules. Let me try to think through this step by step.

Alright, the setup is that Mike is designing a high-resolution TEM operating at 1000 kV. He's using vacuum pumps to get an ultra-high vacuum, which is less than 10^-9 Torr. That's really low pressure, so there aren't many gas molecules around. But even with that, some gas particles are still present, as detected by the mass spectrometer. 

Mike calculated the mean free path of these gas molecules as λ1. Wait, mean free path depends on pressure, temperature, and the size of the molecules. The formula I remember is λ = (k*T)/(√2 * π * d² * P), where k is Boltzmann's constant, T is temperature, d is the diameter of the molecules, and P is pressure. Or maybe it's another form, but the key is that it's inversely proportional to pressure and depends on temperature and the size of the molecules.

But then, when he turns on the electron beam, the mean free path changes to λ2. The question is, why is λ2 different from λ1?

Hmm, the temperature remained the same, so T is the same. The pressure in the compartment is still the same because the pumps are running and the setup hasn't changed. So why would the mean free path change?

Wait, maybe the electron beam is affecting the gas molecules somehow. Like, perhaps it's causing them to ionize or change their velocity? Or maybe the beam is heating the area, but the question says the temperature remains the same, so that's probably not it.

Another thought: the presence of the electron beam could cause the gas molecules to be excited or ionized. If gas molecules become ions, their effective diameter might change. Wait, no, ions are charged, but in terms of collisions, maybe their cross-section changes. Or perhaps the beam causes the gas to dissociate into smaller molecules, which would increase the mean free path because smaller molecules have a higher mean free path for the same pressure and temperature. Or perhaps the ions are moving faster, increasing the mean free path.

Wait, wait. Let me think about the mean free path. Mean free path is the average distance a molecule travels between collisions. So if the effective cross-sectional area (σ) increases, the mean free path would decrease. Because λ is inversely proportional to the square of the diameter (or cross-sectional area) of the molecules.

So if the electron beam is causing the gas molecules to ionize or perhaps to increase in size somehow, their effective cross-sectional area would change. Alternatively, maybe the beam is causing the gas to be excited into a higher energy state, perhaps moving faster.

Wait, but when a gas is ionized, the ions have a charge. But in terms of collisions, the cross-section for collisions could be different. Alternatively, maybe the ions are being accelerated by the beam, so their velocities are higher. That would affect the mean free path. Because the mean free path depends on velocity as well.

Wait, the mean free path formula is λ = (1/√2) * (v * τ), where τ is the mean collision time. Or another way, λ is also given by (k*T)/(√2 * π * d² * P). So if the temperature is the same, but the pressure doesn't
