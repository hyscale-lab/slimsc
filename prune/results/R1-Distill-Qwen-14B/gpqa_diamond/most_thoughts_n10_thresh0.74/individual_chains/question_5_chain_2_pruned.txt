Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the eigenvector of a certain operator. Let me try to think through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a shot.

The question is about a muon, which is like a heavy electron, but I think the specifics about the muon might not matter here. The operator in question is P, and we're looking for its eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. The direction is arbitrary but lies in the x-z plane. Hmm, wait, no, the operator is along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. Oh right, because the operator is a vector and the direction is given by n. So the operator P would be something like the dot product of the Pauli matrices scaled by ħ/2, maybe?

Wait, the components of P are given. P_x is (ħ/2) times a matrix with [0 1; 1 0], which is the Pauli X matrix. Similarly, P_y is (ħ/2) times [0 -i; i 0], which is the Pauli Y matrix. P_z is (ħ/2) times [1 0; 0 -1], the Pauli Z matrix. So each component is basically the Pauli matrix multiplied by ħ/2.

But wait, the operator we're considering is along a direction n in the x-z plane. So the direction vector n can be expressed in terms of its components in x and z. Let's say n is (sinθ, 0, cosθ), because it's in the x-z plane. So the operator P would be the vector operator P = P_x x-hat + P_z z-hat, but scaled by some factor. Wait, no, more accurately, the operator along n would be the sum of each component multiplied by the direction's components. So, Pauli matrices multiplied by n_x, n_y, n_z, but since n is in x-z, n_y is zero. So the operator would be proportional to n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z.

Wait, but the eigenvalue we're seeking is +ħ/2. So the operator we're considering is the component of P along n, which is given by (n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z). But since n
