Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. Hmm, let's see what it says. The question is about a light beam propagating through glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam, towards the observer in the lab. And the question is, what's the speed of the light relative to the observer?

Wait, okay. So I remember that when dealing with light in different media, the speed changes based on the refractive index. Oh right, the speed is c divided by n, but wait, c is the speed in vacuum. But wait, in this case, the glass is moving. So how does that affect the observed speed of light?

I think I need to consider the frame of reference here. The lab frame is where the glass is moving, right? So from the lab's perspective, the glass is moving at velocity v. But light is moving through the glass, which is itself moving.

Wait, in special relativity, velocities don't just add up linearly because of the way velocities transform between frames. Oh wait, but waitâ€”is this a relativistic scenario? The problem says the glass is moving at a constant velocity v, but doesn't specify if v is significant compared to c. Hmm. But I'm not sure whether to apply relativistic velocity addition here.

Wait, the speed of light in the glass when the medium is stationary is c/n. But when the medium is moving towards the observer at velocity v, how does that affect the speed we measure?

Let me think. If the glass is moving towards me, maybe the light's speed as seen from the lab is different. But I'm a bit confused because in different frames, the speed of light is always c in a vacuum, but here the light is inside a medium. So perhaps the medium's motion affects the observed speed.

Wait, but the speed of light in a medium is generally c/n. But when the medium is moving, does that change the observed speed of the light? I'm not entirely sure. Let me think about it.

Another approach: consider the velocity of the light as measured in the lab frame. The glass is moving at velocity v, and the light is moving at v_light relative to the glass. So the lab would measure the velocity as the sum of the glass's velocity and the velocity of light in the glass.

Wait, but that's probably a non-relativistic approach. In reality, when velocities are significant compared to c, you need to use the relativistic velocity addition formula.

The relativistic formula for adding velocities u and v is
