Okay, so I've got this question about binary star systems and their masses. Hmm, I remember that in binary systems, the stars orbit a common center of mass. The radial velocity method is used to detect these stars because as they move towards and away from us, their velocity changes, which we can measure using Doppler shifts.

The question says that system_1 and system_2 have periods of 2 years and 1 year respectively. So the orbital period is the time it takes for both stars to orbit each other once. Both systems are binary, so each has two stars orbiting around their mutual center of mass.

The radial velocity (RV) amplitudes are given for each system. For system_1, the stars have amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. For system_2, the amplitudes are 15 km/s and 10 km/s. Wait, RV amplitude is the maximum speed each star moves towards or away from us, right?

I think the key here is that the mass of each star is inversely proportional to their RV amplitudes. Because in the center of mass, the more massive star would have a smaller orbit, hence a smaller velocity amplitude. So if one star is more massive, the other will have a larger velocity.

Let me think about the formula. The mass ratio (q) is the mass of the companion divided by the mass of the primary. So q = M2/M1. And the RV semi-amplitudes are inversely proportional to the masses. So K2/K1 = (M1)/(M2) ) = 1/q.

Wait, wait. The radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by the formula K = (v) = ( (2πG) / (P) )^(1/3) * (M2 sin i) / ( (M1 + M2)^(2/3) (1 + q) ) )

But maybe I can think in terms of mass functions. Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that the ratio of the velocities is inversely proportional to the masses. Since system_1's stars have velocities 10 and 5, their mass ratio should be 5/10 = 0.5. So M1/M2 = 0.5 → M1 = 0.5*M2 → total mass of system_1 is M1 + M2 = 0.5M2 + M2 = 1.5 M2.

Wait, wait no, the velocities are inversely proportional to the masses. So if K1 is 10 and K2 is 5, then M1 / M2 = K2 / K1 = 5/10 = 0.5. So M1 = 0.5 M2. Then the total mass of system_1 is M1 + M2 = 0.5 M2 + M2 = 1.5 M2.

Similarly, for system_2, the RVs are 15 and 10. So the mass ratio would be K2/K1 = 10/15 = 2/3. So M1' = (2/3) M2' → M1' = 0.666... M2'. So the total mass for system_2 is M1' + M2' = (2/3 M2') + M2' = (5/3) M2' = M2_total.

Wait, so for system_1, the total mass is 1.5 M2, and for system_2, it's (5/3) M2'? Wait, but the M2 in system_1 refers to the mass of the companion in that system, while system_2 has its own M2' (let me maybe use different variables to avoid confusion).

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to model each system separately.

For system_1: velocities K1a =10, K1b=5. Let their masses be M1a and M1b.

The mass ratio q1 = M1b / M1a = K1a / K1b = 10/5 = 2. So M1b = 2 M1a.

Total mass M1
