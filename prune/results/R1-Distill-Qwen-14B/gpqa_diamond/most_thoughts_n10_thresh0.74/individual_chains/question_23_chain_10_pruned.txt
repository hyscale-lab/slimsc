Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here. Let me see what it's about. The question involves a reaction with hydrogen bromide, HBr. The starting material is ((2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxy)benzene. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me try to draw that structure.

So, the structure is benzene with an ether group attached. The ether's oxygen is connected to a 2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl group. Wait, but-3-en-1-yl means a four-carbon chain with a double bond starting at the third carbon. So, the structure would be something like:

The benzene ring is connected via an oxygen to a CH2 group. Then, that CH2 is connected to a C with two methyl groups (since it's 2,2-dimethyl), then a double bond, and then another CH2 at the end? Wait, no, but-3-en-1-yl is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but with the double bond between C3 and C4? No, wait, but-3-en-1-yl would have the double bond between carbons 3 and 4, but that's probably not possible because but has four carbons, so positions 1, 2, 3, 4. So, the ene is at position 3, so the structure is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with the double bond between the third and fourth? Wait, no, but-3-ene would be CH2=CHCH2CH2- ... Wait, no, but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2? No, maybe it's CH2-CH2-C double bond CH2-CH2. Wait, maybe I should write it as CH2-CH2-C=CH2? No, maybe it's CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond? Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, the correct structure of but-3-en-1-yl is CH2CH2CH=CH2? No, but-3-en-1-yl is CH2-CH2-CH=CH2? Wait, but that's four carbons, so 1,2,3,4. The double
