Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let's see what it's about. The question is about a particle in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential. Hmm, I remember that an isotropic potential means it's the same in all directions. The potential given is V(r) = (1/2) m ω² r². Oh right, that's like a 3D version of the harmonic oscillator, so each direction (x, y, z) acts like an independent oscillator.

The question asks for the energy of the third excited state and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for that energy. Hmm, I think I need to recall how energy levels work in 3D harmonic oscillators. Oh wait, the energy levels depend on the quantum numbers in each direction.

In a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are given by E = ħω (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2), right? Because each direction contributes (n_i + 1/2) ħω, and summing them gives E = ħω (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2). Oh wait, actually, each direction's energy is (n_i + 1/2) ħω, so adding them gives E = ħω (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2), because 1/2 three times is 3/2.

Now, the states are determined by the quantum numbers n_x, n_y, n_z, which are non-negative integers (0,1,2,...). The energy depends on the sum n = n_x + n_y + n_z. So different combinations of n_x, n_y, n_z that give the same sum n will have the same energy.

The problem is about the third excited state. Wait, excited states start counting from the ground state. The ground state is the lowest energy, which is when all n_x, n_y, n_z are zero. So the ground state is n=0 (n_x + n_y + n_z =0). The first excited state is when one of the n's is 1, the others 0. So n=1. Second excited state is n=2, third is n=3?

Wait, no, wait. Because the order of excitation depends on the energy. The energy E is determined by n = n_x + n_y + n_z. So the ground state is n=0 (E= (3/2) ħω). Then the first excited state would have n=1. But when n=1, the possible states are the ones where any one of the n's is 1. How many states are there for n=1? Well, each n can be 1 in x, y, or z direction. So 3 possibilities. So those are the first excited states.

Then the next level is n=2. The number of states for n=2 would be the number of ways to write 2 as the sum of three non-negative integers. Which includes cases like 2,0,0; 0,2,0; 0,0,2, and 1,1,0 and its permutations. So the number is (number of permutations for each combination). For 2,0,0: there are 3 permutations. For 1,1,0: there are 3 permutations (since two are same, so 3!/(2!1!) = 3). So total 6 states for n=2.

Similarly, n=3 would have more states. So the third excited state is when n=3. So the energy E is (3 + 3/2) ħω. Because E = ħω (n +3/2). Wait, n is the sum of n_x, n_y, n_z. So if n=3, E = (3 +3/2) ħω = (9/2) ħω. So the first part of the answer is (9/2)ħω.

Now, the second part is the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for
