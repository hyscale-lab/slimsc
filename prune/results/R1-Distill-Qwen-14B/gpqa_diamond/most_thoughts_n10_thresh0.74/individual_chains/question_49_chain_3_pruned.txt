Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about sigmatropic rearrangements. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through each step.

The question has three parts, A, B, and C, and I need to match each with the right product from the options. Let's take them one by one.

Starting with reaction 1: 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine reacts with but-3-en-2-ol in the presence of H+ and heat. Hmm, I remember that sigmatropic rearrangements involve the shift of a sigma bond with a pi bond moving. Cope and Claisen are examples, but this reaction might be something else. Wait, the starting material has two methoxy groups on the amine. Oh wait, 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine would be like (CH3O)2CH-NH2? Or maybe it's CH2(OCH3)2-NH2? I'm a bit confused but I'll go with that.

But-3-en-2-ol is CH2CHCH2-OH, but wait, position 3 for the double bond? Let me draw it: CH2-CH2-CH2-OH with a double bond between carbons 2 and 3? Or maybe I'm getting the numbering wrong. Wait, but-3-en-2-ol would be CH2CH(OH)CH2, but I think that's not correct. Wait, but-3-en-2-ol would be HOCH2CH2CH2? No, wait the double bond is between carbons 2 and 3. So structure is CH2=CH-CH(OH)-CH3? Wait no, but-3-en-2-ol would be HOCH2CH2CH2CH2 with a double bond. Wait, but but-3-en-2-ol is CH2CH2CH2-OH with a double bond between C2 and C3. Wait, maybe I should write the structure as CH2=CH-CH(OH)-CH3? No, wait that's pent-3-en-2-ol. Oh wait, but-3-en-2-ol is CH2CH2CH2-OH, but but has four carbons. Wait, perhaps it's CH2=CHCH(OH)CH3
