Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. So that's like benzene, but with two substituents attached. The FTIR shows an ester group, which means there's an O in a carbonyl group attached to an OR group. Ester groups typically show strong absorption around 1740 cm-1 for the carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So that's a clue about the substituents.

Looking at the 1H NMR spectrum: six signals. Let me break down what each signal represents.

First, two aromatic-H signals. So, the aromatic ring has substituents. Since it's di-substituted, the arrangement of the substituents matters. If the substituents are in certain positions, the number of unique aromatic protons changes. For example, if they're para, there would be two sets of equivalent protons. But wait, the problem says two signals for aromatic-H. So that suggests maybe the substituents are in positions that make two different types of aromatic protons. Like, maybe they are in ortho positions or maybe it's a para-substituted but with different substituents causing the protons to be non-equivalent. Hmm, but I'm not sure yet.

Next, two vinyl-H signals. One is a doublet and the other a doublet of quartets. Vinyl protons are typically on double bonds, like in an alkene. So perhaps the compound has an ester group and an alkene group attached to the ring.

Wait, the ester group is O-CO-O, but perhaps part of the structure is an aryl ester. Alternatively, maybe the substituents include an ester and another group. Oh, wait, let's think about possible structures. Since it's a di-substituted benzene, maybe one substituent is an ester (like OAc, acetoxy group) and the other is something else, perhaps a vinyl group, like a substituted vinyl group.

Wait, but the NMR has two vinyl-H signals. So maybe the substituent is a vinyl group attached to the ring. Let's think: a vinyl group like CH2=CH- attached as a substituent. But wait, if it's an ester, maybe the substituent is an ester group connected to another carbon chain. Alternatively, perhaps it's a benzyl ester or something else.

Wait, the NMR shows two signals for vinyl-H. So maybe the substituent is a vinyl group, which is a CH2-CH2 group. But that might lead to more splitting. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a group like CH2=CH-CO-O-R. Hmm, but I'm not sure yet.

Looking further, the NMR also has two signals corresponding to -CH3 groups. So there are two different methyl groups. So where could those come from? Maybe one from the ester, like the acetyl group in an acetate. So the ester would be OAc, which is O-CO-OCH2CH3? Wait, no, OAc is O-CO-OCH3. Wait, no, wait: the acet
