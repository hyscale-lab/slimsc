Okay, so I've got this genetics question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Hmm, let's see what the question is about.

So, the scenario is that there's this cultivar of barley that's drought-resistant but has an anti-nutritional compound. The gene responsible has five exons and four introns. They used EMS mutagenesis to create mutants and then sequenced the target gene in all mutants. They found changes in the first exon area. The goal is to find which mutation would eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.

Wait, so the idea is that this compound is bad for food use, so we want to get rid of it. That probably means we need to disrupt the gene's function so the compound isn't synthesized. So which mutation would do that?

The intact gene is provided, as well as four mutants. I need to look for which mutation disrupts the gene's function, probably by causing a premature stop codon or a frameshift that changes the protein structure enough to either stop it early or make it nonfunctional.

Let me look at each mutant's sequence.

Intact gene:
5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Mutant 1:
5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Comparing to the intact gene, the first part where they differ is somewhere in the exons. Let's see, the original is ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTG... The mutant 1 starts with ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTG...

Wait, let me line them up.

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA...
Mutant1: ATG TCT TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA...

Wait, perhaps the mutation is in the third codon. Let's see, the original is TTT (Phe) and then CTC (Leu), GCT (Ala), etc. In Mutant1, it's TCT (Ser) and then TAC (Tyr), GCT (Ala). Wait, so the first few codons have changed. So the amino acids would change from Phe-Leu-Ala-... to Ser-Tyr-Ala-... Hmm, that's a change but not necessarily a frameshift or a stop codon. So it's a missense mutation. Does that disrupt the protein enough? Maybe, but perhaps not completely.

Mutant 2:
5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Looking at the same region, the first part is ATG TCT TAA GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA...
Wait, TAA is a stop codon. Oh, wait a minute. Let me check. The first few nucleotides in the mutant: ATG TCT TAA GCT... So the third codon is TAA, which is a stop
