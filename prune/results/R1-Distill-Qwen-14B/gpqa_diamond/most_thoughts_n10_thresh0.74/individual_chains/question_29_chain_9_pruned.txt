Okay, so I have this question about genetics and mutations. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about a drought-resistant barley cultivar that has an anti-nutritional compound. They found the gene responsible for it, which has five exons and four introns. They used EMS mutagenesis, and now they're looking at the mutations in the target gene. The goal is to find which mutation will eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.

The intact gene's sequence is given, and there are four mutants (1-4). I need to look at each mutant's sequence and see which one changes would likely disrupt the gene's function, thereby stopping the compound's production.

First, I remember that genes are made up of exons and introns. Exons are the coding regions, so changes there can affect the protein. Introns are non-coding, but their splicing is important. However, changes in exons are more likely to affect the protein structure.

Looking at the sequences, the question says that the changes are at the beginning of the sequence in the first exon area. So the focus is on the first part of the gene, probably the start codon or early exons.

The anti-nutritional compound is presumably a protein, so if the gene's function is disrupted, the protein won't be made, and the compound will be eliminated.

I need to analyze each mutation for changes that cause a frameshift, a premature stop codon, or an alteration in the amino acid sequence that disrupts function.

Looking at each mutant:

Intact gene: 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Mutant 1:
5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

Comparing to intact:

Intact starts with ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA...
Mutant 1: ATG TTT CTC becomes TCT ACG C? Wait, let me count.

Wait, let me write out the changes.

Let me break it down:

Intact first part: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...
Mutant 1: ATG TTT CT C GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

Wait, maybe the third codon is where the mutation is. Let me count the nucleotides.

Intact gene maybe: position 1-3: ATG (start), 4-6: TTT, 7-9: CTC, 10-12: GCT, etc.

Mutant1: ATG TTT CTA CGC... So at position 7-9, instead of CTC, it's CTA? Or wait, perhaps a substitution.

Wait, perhaps it's better to look for where the changes occur in each mutant.

Mutant 1's sequence:

5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

Comparing to intact:

Intact starts with ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

Mutant1: ATG TTT CTA CGC ... Hmm, perhaps a substitution in the third codon.

Wait, the third codon in the intact is CTC (Leu), and in Mutant1, it's CTA (Leu as well?) Wait, CTA is Leu as well. So that's a silent mutation, no change in amino acid. Then the next codon in intact is GCT (Ala), but in Mutant1, it's CGC (Arg). So that's a substitution from GCT to CGC. GCT is Ala (64), CGC is Arg (63). So that's a missense mutation. So the amino acid changes from Ala to Arg. Could that affect the protein? Maybe, but not necessarily a stop codon. So the protein would be altered but not necessarily nonfunctional unless it's in a critical region.

Mutant 2:

5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

Comparing to intact: Let's see. The intact after ATG is TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT... So Mutant2 has TTA AAG CTG G... Hmm, wait, maybe the sequence where the change is occurs earlier. Let's look more carefully.

Wait, the starting part of the mutant 2 is ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACT...

Intact is ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACT...

So in the intact, the first part is ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT...

Mutant2: ATG TTT CT AA GCT GGT ACT...

Wait, perhaps a substitution in the third codon. The third codon in intact is CTC (Leu). In Mutant2, that's CT AAG? Or perhaps I should count the nucleotides.

Let me line them up
