Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me read it again. So, there are 10,000 identical systems, each with a particle moving along a tube, which is the x-axis. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. And when they measured the particles' positions, none were found outside the region from x=1 to x=3. I need to find the value of 'a'.

Wait, the wave function is a complex number here. But in quantum mechanics, the wave function must be normalizable because the total probability must be 1. So the integral of the probability density (which is the square of the absolute value of the wave function) over all space should be 1.

So the first thing I should check is the normalization condition. The wave function is ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Let me write that as ψ(x) = A - B i, where A is a/(sqrt(1+x)) and B is 0.5.

The absolute square is |ψ|^2 = (A)^2 + (B)^2 because (A - Bi)(A + Bi) = A^2 + B^2. So the probability density is [a^2/(1 + x)] + (0.5)^2.

The normalization condition is the integral from x=1 to x=3 of [a²/(1+x) + 0.25] dx equals 1.

Wait, but why is the integral from 1 to 3? Because the problem states that when measuring, particles are only found between x=1 and x=3. So the wave function must be zero outside this region. But the given wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Wait, is that the wave function only in the region between 1 and 3, or everywhere?

Hmm, the question says each particle can exist in a part of space and the wave function is described as that. But the measurements show that only x between 1 and 3 have particles. So perhaps the wave function is zero outside that interval. But the given ψ(x) is only that expression—does that mean that ψ is zero elsewhere? Or is it that the wave function is non-zero only between 1 and 3?

Wait, if the wave function is non-zero only between 1 and 3, then the given expression applies there, and it's zero elsewhere. So the integral for normalization would be from 1 to 3.

So, the normalization integral is:

∫₁³ [ (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx = 1.

Let me compute this integral.

Breaking it into two parts:

∫ (a²)/(1+x) dx from 1 to 3 plus ∫ 0.25 dx from 1 to3.

The first integral: ∫ a²/(1+x) dx. The integral of 1/(1+x) is ln(1+x), so this becomes a² [ ln(4) - ln(2) ) ] = a² ln(2).

Because ln(4) is ln(2^2)=2 ln2, and ln(2) is as is, so 2 ln2 - ln2 = ln2. So first part is a² ln2.

Second integral: ∫ 0.25 dx from 1 to3 is 0.25*(3-1) =0.5.

So the total integral is a² ln2 + 0.5 = 1.

So, solving for a²: a² = (1 - 0.5)/ln2 = 0.5 / ln2.

Calculate ln2: approximately 0.6931.

So a² = 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.5 /0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

Then a = sqrt(0.7213). Let's compute that. sqrt(0.7213) is approximately 0.849, which is close to 0.85. Looking at the options, option B is 0.85.

Wait, but let me check the calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Wait, the wave function is ψ(x) = [a/sqrt(1+x)] - 0.5i. So the absolute square is [a²/(1+x)] + (0.5)^2, since (a/sqrt(1+x))^2 + (0.5)^2. So that's correct.

The integral from 1 to 3 of [a²/(1+x) + 0.25] dx.

Yes, integrating each term separately. The first term integral is a² ln(1+x) evaluated from 1 to 3. So, ln(4) - ln(2) is ln(2), so a² ln2.

The second term is 0.25*(2) = 0.5.

So equation: a² ln2 + 0.5 =1 → a² ln2 = 0.5 → a² = 0.5/(ln2) ≈ 0.5 /0.6931≈ 0.7213 → a≈0.849, so option B is 0.85.

Wait, but the given wave function is only in the region where x is between 1 and 3? Because outside, the wave function is zero, so the expression given is valid only between 1 and 3. So our integral is correct.

So the value of 'a' is approximately 0.85, which is option B.


To determine the value of "a" in the wave function, we start by ensuring the wave function is normalized. The wave function is given as:

\[
\psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i
\]

The probability density is the absolute square of the wave function:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25
\]

The normalization condition requires the integral of the probability density over the region where the particle exists (between \(x=1\) and \(x=3\)) to equal 1:

\[
\int_1^3 \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1
\]

Breaking this into two parts:

1. **First term**:  
   \[
   \int_1^3 \frac{a^2}{1+x} dx = a^2 \int_1^3 \frac{1}{1+x} dx = a^2 \left[\ln(1+x)\right]_1^3 = a^2 \left(\ln(4) - \ln(2)\right) = a^2 \ln(2)
   \]

2. **Second term**:  
   \[
   \int_1^3 0.25 dx = 0.25 \cdot (3-1) = 0.5
\]

Adding these results, the normalization condition becomes:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1
\]

Solving for \(a^2\):

\[
a^2 = \frac{1 - 0.5}{\ln(2)} = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}
\]

Using \(\ln(2) \approx 0.6931\):

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7213
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
a \approx \sqrt{0.7213} \approx 0.849
\]

This value is closest to 0.85, which corresponds to option B.

**Answer: B**
