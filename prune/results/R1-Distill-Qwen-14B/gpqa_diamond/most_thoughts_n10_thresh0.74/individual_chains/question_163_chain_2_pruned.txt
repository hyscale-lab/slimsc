Okay, so I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem. Let me read it again and figure out what I need to do.

The question is about dissolving 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm³ of solution using a monobasic strong acid. I need to find the minimum volume of 0.1 M acid required and the pH of the resulting solution. The options are A to D, with different pH and volumes.

First, I think I should start by finding out how much Fe(OH)3 is there in moles. Fe(OH)3 has a molar mass I can calculate. Fe is about 55.85 g/mol, O is 16, H is 1. So for Fe(OH)3: 55.85 + 3*(16 + 1) = 55.85 + 3*17 = 55.85 +51=106.85 g/mol.

So 0.1 grams divided by 106.85 g/mol. Let me calculate that: 0.1 / 106.85 ≈ 0.000936 mol, which is 9.36 x 10^-4 moles.

Fe(OH)3 is a weak base. When it reacts with a strong acid like HCl (monobasic), it should undergo acid-base neutralization. The reaction should be Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ → Fe³+ + 3H2O. So each mole of Fe(OH)3 will react with 3 moles of H+ ions.

So the moles of H+ needed are 3 times the moles of Fe(OH)3. That's 3 * 0.000936 ≈ 0.002808 mol.

The acid solution is 0.1 M, which is 0.1 mol/L. Since 100 cm³ is 0.1 L, but wait, wait. Wait, the problem says the total volume is 100 cm³, but the acid is added to this solution. Wait, the initial solution is 100 cm³, but when I add the acid, the total volume might change. Hmm, but for the minimum volume, perhaps it's assumed that the added volume is negligible compared to 100 cm³. Or maybe it's part of the total volume? I'm not sure. Wait, the question says that the total volume is 100 cm³. So whatever volume of acid I add, plus the solution must sum up to 100 cm³? No, wait, I think the initial solution is 100 cm³, and we're adding the acid to it. Or maybe the 100 cm³ is the final volume. Hmm, that complicates things because adding more acid would change the volume. But perhaps for the purpose of this calculation, it's assumed that the volume change is negligible. Alternatively, maybe the 100 cm³ is the final volume. Let me think.

Wait, the problem says "dissolve (at 25
