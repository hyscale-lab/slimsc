Okay, so I have this question about which stars can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step.

First, I remember that both instruments have different magnitude limits. ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than V magnitude 17. HIRES can go down to brighter than 16 V. So a star must be brighter than 17 for ESPRESSO, but wait, no, wait. Wait, the question says that with ESPRESSO, stars brighter than 17 mag are observed. Wait, no, wait: the text says 'brighter than 17 mag can be observed'—wait, no, in astronomy, lower magnitudes are brighter. So a star with magnitude 17 is fainter than a star with 16. So ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitude up to 17, meaning that stars brighter than (i.e., with lower magnitudes) 17. Similarly, HIRES can observe stars up to 16 mag. Wait, no: the wording says, "brighter than 17 V mag for ESPRESSO, and 16 V mag for HIRES." Wait, no—wait, the question says, "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed" with ESPRESSO. So, apparent magnitude (how bright they appear from Earth) matters here, right?

So the key is to find stars whose apparent V magnitude is less than or equal to 17 for ESPRESSO and less than or equal to 16 for HIRES. Wait, no: because being 'brighter than 17' would mean the apparent magnitude is less than 17. Because lower magnitude is brighter. So a star with apparent magnitude 16 is brighter than 17. So ESPRESSO can handle up to 17, HIRES up to 16.

So any star whose apparent V magnitude is ≤17 can be observed by ESPRESSO, and ≤16 for HIRES.

The question is asking which stars can be detected with both. So the star must have apparent V mag ≤17 (for ESPRESSO) and ≤16 (for HIRES). Wait, no: because being detected by both requires that it's within the capability of both. So the star's apparent V mag must
