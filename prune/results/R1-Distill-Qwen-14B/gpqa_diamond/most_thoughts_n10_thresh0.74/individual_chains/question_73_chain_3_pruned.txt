Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm. Let me think about how to approach this.

The problem states: two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m are moving at speeds 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. The options give possible answers for their relative speed and total energy.

First, I remember that when dealing with speeds close to the speed of light, I shouldn't use classical mechanics because the speeds are a significant fraction of c. So, I'll need to use special relativity principles here.

Let's break it down into two parts: finding the relative speed between the two astronauts and calculating the total energy of the system.

Starting with the relative speed. Relativistic velocities don't just add up linearly. Wait, right, the velocity addition formula comes into play here. But wait, I think the formula is used to find the velocity of one object as seen from another frame. Oh, right! The formula is (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/c²).

Wait, wait. Let me get that straight. So, if astronaut A is moving at speed u and astronaut B at speed v, but both in the same direction, then the relative speed of B as seen from A would be (v - u)/(1 - (u v)/c²), because u is the speed of A in the rest frame, and v is the speed of B in that same frame. So, if A is moving at 0.6c, and B at 0.5c, then from A's perspective, B is moving at (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c²). Simplify that.

Wait, let me compute that step by step. The numerator would be 0.5c - 0.6c = -0.1c. The denominator is 1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c². Let's compute the denominator: 0.6 * 0.5 = 0.3, and then 0.3 c^2 / c² is 0.3, so denominator is 1 - 0.3 = 0.7.

So the relative speed is (-0.1c) / 0.7. Which is approximately -0.142857 c. But since speed is a scalar, the direction (negative sign) indicates direction, but the magnitude is 0.142857 c, which is roughly 0.14c. So the relative speed between them is about 0.14c. Hmm, looking at the options, both option C and D have 0.14c as the relative speed. So that's one part done.

Now, moving on to the total energy of the system. The total energy is the sum of each astronaut's relativistic energy. Each astronaut's energy is given by gamma * mc². Wait, but wait, their rest mass is their own mass. So, for the first astronaut, mass is 2m, speed 0.6c. Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - (v^2/c^2)). Let me calculate gamma for each.

For astronaut
