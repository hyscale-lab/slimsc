Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on relativity, but I'll try to think this through.

Alright, the problem states that the two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. The question is asking for their relative speed and the total energy of the system.

Wait, so relative speed in relativity isn't just a simple subtraction like in classical mechanics. I remember that you have to use the velocity addition formula from special relativity. The formula is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)). Oh wait, no, wait. I think it's (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1 v2)/(c^2)). Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me get that right.

So the formula for relative velocity when two objects are moving along the same line is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1 v2)/(c²)), right? But wait, which direction? Oh, right, because they're both moving in the same direction. So the relative speed is the difference, but you have to account for the relativity of velocity addition.

Wait, let me get this straight. If astronaut A is moving at v1 relative to the rest frame, and astronaut B is moving at v2, then in A's frame, B's velocity would be (v2 - v1)/(1 - (v1 v2)/(c²)). Or is it the other way around? Hmm. Wait, I think the formula is (v2 - v1)/(1 - (v1 v2)/(c²)) when you're finding the velocity of B as seen from A's frame. Because if A is at rest and B is moving at v2, then in A's frame, B's speed is (v2 - v1)/(1 - ... ). Wait, I'm getting myself mixed up.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to use the formula for the relative velocity of two objects moving in the same direction. Let me write the formula down.

The relative speed u is (v1 - v2) / (1 - (v1 v2)/(c²)). Wait, but wait, are both velocities positive or do I have to plug them as directed? Let me think. If both are moving in the same direction,
