Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. The question is about the minimum energy of an isolated system of particles with charge and fixed positions. Hmm.

So, the setup is: there are 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. The mass is negligible, so I don't have to worry about kinetic energy or anything like that—it's purely electric potential energy. 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. I'm supposed to find the minimum energy of this system.

Wait a second, okay, so the system's energy comes from the electric potential energy between all the charges. Since all the charges are the same, I can model this using Coulomb's law for potential energy between point charges.

But wait, the system is isolated, so no external work is done, right? The charges are fixed in place except for the 13th, which is at P. Or wait, the 13th is fixed at P, and the other 12 are at 2m from P. So the 12 are all at the same distance from the 13th charge.

Hmm, so what's the potential energy of the system? I think electric potential energy for a system of point charges is the sum of the potential energies of each pair. But since all the other charges are identical and placed symmetrically, maybe I can find a pattern.

So for a system of N identical point charges, the total electric potential energy is given by U = (1/(4πε₀)) * (N choose 2) * (q²)/(r), where r is the distance between each pair. Wait, but in this case, the 13th charge is fixed, so how many pairs do we have?

Let me think. There are 13 charges. The 13th is fixed, so each of the other 12 charges is at a distance of 2m from P. So the distance between each of the 12 and the 13th is 2m. But what about the distances between the 12
