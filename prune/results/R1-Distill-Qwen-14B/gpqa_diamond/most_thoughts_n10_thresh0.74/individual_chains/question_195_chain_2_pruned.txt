Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

So, there's a planet (let's call it Planet A) with Earth's radius, orbiting a star that's 1.5 times the Sun's radius. The planet's period is 3 days, and it has a transit impact parameter of 0.2. Now, they're asking about a second planet (Planet B) with a radius 2.5 times Earth's. Both planets are in circular orbits and share the same orbital plane. The question is about the maximum orbital period Planet B can have and still show both transit and occultation events.

Hmm. So I remember that for a planet to transit, it needs to pass directly in front of the star from our point of view. For occultation, the planet needs to pass behind the star so that the star blocks it from view. Both events require precise alignment.

Wait, transit and occultation—so if Planet B is larger, maybe it's farther out? But orbital period relates to the distance from the star. Closer planets have shorter periods, right? Because Kepler's third law says that the period squared is proportional to the semi-major axis cubed. So a longer period would mean a larger orbit.

But wait, the question is about the maximum period. So what's the limit here? I think it's about whether Planet B's orbit is such that when it's behind the star (occultation) and in front (transit), it's within the line of sight. So the alignment needs to be such that their orbital planes allow these events.

Wait, but since both planets share the same orbital plane, the question is more about their orbital periods. So for both transits and occultations to happen, the orbital periods must be such that their relative positions allow these alignments. 

I think the key is about the Hill sphere or maybe the synodic period. Or perhaps it's about the orbital distance—Planet B must be at a distance where its orbit is such that its position relative to Planet A allows both events.

Wait, but maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about transits and occultations. For a transit, Planet B must pass in front of the star as seen from Earth. For an occultation, it must pass behind the star, so the star eclipses Planet B. Both events require that
