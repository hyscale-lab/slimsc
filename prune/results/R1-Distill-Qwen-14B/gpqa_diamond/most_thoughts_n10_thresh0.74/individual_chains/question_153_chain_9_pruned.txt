Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reactions. But I'll take it step by step.

The question is about the Michael addition reactions, which I remember involves enolates reacting with alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compounds. I think the Michael reaction is a 1,4-addition, right? So the nucleophile (enolate) attacks the beta position of the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl, forming a new carbon-carbon bond.

The problem has three parts: reactions (A), (B), and (C). Each of them involves different reactants and conditions, and I need to find out the major products. Then, match them with the options given.

Let me start with reaction (A): dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate in the presence of NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) and EtOH (ethanol). So, what's happening here?

Dimethyl malonate is a good dienophile, but wait, no, in this case, it's acting as the nucleophile. Or wait, in the Michael reaction, the enolate is the nucleophile. So the enolate will attack the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl.

Wait, dimethyl malonate is CH2(CO2Me)2. So, it can form an enolate when treated with a base. The base here is NaOEt, which is a strong enough base to deprotonate the alpha hydrogen. The malonate will form an enolate ion. Then, this enolate will attack the beta position of the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl.

The other reactant is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Its structure should be CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, with the E configuration, meaning the substituents on either side of the double bond are opposite. Wait, no. Actually, 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have the structure CH2-CH-CO-OCH3, but the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2, making it CH2=CH-..., but I'm a bit confused about the numbering. Let me think: acrylate is CH2=CHCOOR. So, 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have the p-tolyl group on the third carbon? Wait, wait, no. Acrylate is CH₂=CH–COOR, so the double bond is between C1 and C2. So, 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have the substituent on C3, which is the carbonyl carbon. Wait, that doesn't make sense because the acrylate is CH₂=CH-CO-OCH3. So, the substituents on the double bond are CH2 and CH-CO-OCH3. So the E configuration would have the p-tolyl group on the opposite side?

Wait, no. Let me think again. The structure of methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH₂–C(p-tolyl)=CH–CO-OCH3? No,
