Okay, so I have this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and think through what's happening.

The question involves a chemist performing two reactions, both starting with different ene structuresâ€”oct-4-ene, one in the E configuration and the other in the Z configuration. Both reactions use one equivalent of mCPBA followed by aqueous acid, and they go to 100% completion. Then the products from both reactions are combined and run on two types of HPLC columns: a standard (achiral) one and a chiral one. The question is about what the chemist observes in terms of peaks on each column.

Hmm, I remember that mCPBA stands for meta-chloroperbenzoic acid. It's a peracid, right? And peracids are commonly used in epoxidation reactions. So when mCPBA reacts with an alkene, it forms an epoxide. Epoxidation is an oxidation reaction, and it's stereospecific. The reaction adds the oxygen in a specific way depending on the geometry of the starting alkene.

Wait, so for each reaction, the starting material is (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene. Let me draw their structures. For (E), the two methyl groups (or whatever substituents) are on opposite sides of the double bond. For (Z), they're on the same side. 

When mCPBA reacts with an alkene, it forms an epoxide. The stereoselectivity of the epoxidation depends on the starting alkene's geometry. For an E-alkene, the epoxide will have a specific stereochemistry, and for a Z-alkene, the epoxide's stereochemistry will be different. Oh wait, or does it form the same epoxide regardless? Hmm, no, wait. Epoxidation proceeds via a cyclic transition state where the peracid adds across the double bond. The stereochemistry of the epoxide depends on the starting alkene's configuration.

Wait, let me think again. The epoxidation of an E-alkene would form a trans-epoxide, and the Z-alkene would form a cis-epoxide. Or is it the other way around? Oh, no, that's not quite right. The peracid adds across the double bond, and for each geometry of the double bond, the resulting epoxide's stereochemistry will differ.

Wait, actually, when an E-alkene reacts with mCPBA, the peracid approaches from the same face because of the cyclic transition state. So the E-alkene has substituents opposite each other. So when the peracid adds, the oxygen adds from the same face, leading to a trans epoxide. Similarly, the Z-alkene, with substituents on the same side, when the peracid adds, the oxygen adds from the same face, leading to a cis epoxide. Or wait, maybe I'm getting this mixed up.

Alternatively, perhaps the stereochemistry of the epoxide depends on the geometry of the starting alkene. For an E-alkene, the substituents are opposite, so the epoxide will form with the oxygen atoms on opposite sides, making a trans epoxide. For
