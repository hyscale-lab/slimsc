Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this physics problem about gamma-ray annihilation with the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photons. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

The question is about determining the energy of gamma-rays whose lifetimes are limited by the process γγ → e+ e-. So, the gamma-rays annihilate with CMB photons to produce electron-positron pairs. I remember that this process is a significant factor in determining the maximum energy of gamma-rays in the universe because they can't travel too far without interacting in this way.

The given average photon energy of the CMB is 10^-3 eV. I think I need to find the threshold energy for this annihilation process. Wait, in particle physics, the threshold condition for pair production (like e+ e-) is when the center-of-mass energy is just enough to create the particles. So the minimum energy required for this process is when the total energy equals the rest mass energy of the electron and positron.

The rest mass of an electron is about 0.511 MeV. Since we're creating both an electron and a positron, the total rest mass energy would be 2 * 0.511 MeV = 1.022 MeV. But wait, wait. Since the process is γ + γ → e+ + e-, the energy of each photon is important. I think the center-of-mass energy squared (s) must be at least (2m_e c²)^2, where m_e is the electron mass. So s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c + p2 c)^2, but since photons are massless and moving in opposite directions, maybe I should consider the energies in the right frame.

Alternatively, I remember that for head-on collisions, the condition is that the sum of the energies squared is greater than (2m_e c²)^2. So the condition would be E_gamma * E_photon ≥ (m_e c²)^2 / 4. Or wait, maybe it's E_γ * E_photon ≥ (m_e c²)^2 / (4). Because when two photons collide head-on, their energies multiply in that condition.

Wait, I think the correct threshold condition is derived from conservation of energy and momentum. Let me try to derive it.

Each photon has energy E1 and E2, moving in opposite directions. The total energy in the center-of-mass frame is E1 + E2, and the momentum is E1/c - E2/c (since photons have momentum E/c in their direction of motion). For the process to create an electron-positron pair, the total energy must be at least 2 m_e c².

Wait, maybe considering the invariant s which is (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c + p2 c)^2 (but since p2 is in the opposite direction, it's (p1 - p2)). Wait, photons have p = E/(c), so if they're moving in opposite directions, say along the x-axis, one photon has p1 in +x and the other p2 in -x. So the total momentum is p1 - p2.

Wait, but in the threshold condition, the process just occurs when the electron and
