Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem to solve. Hmm, the question is about finding the uncertainty in the P_z operator for a given state. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I remember that the uncertainty ΔP_z is calculated using the formula ΔP_z = sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²). So I need to find the expectation values of P_z and P_z squared.

The state vector is given as a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). Let me denote this state as |ψ⟩. The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z, which I think are the standard computational basis here.

The matrix for P_z is diagonal, right? It's given as:
[ [ħ, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, -ħ] ]

So the diagonal entries are ħ, 0, and -ħ. That means the eigenstates are |+z⟩, |0z⟩, and |-z⟩ corresponding to the three basis vectors.

Wait, but the given state is written in the P_z basis. So each component of |ψ⟩ corresponds to the eigenvalue of P_z. Because the basis vectors are eigenvectors of P_z, the state |ψ⟩ is a linear combination of those eigenvectors.

So, the state |ψ⟩ is a vector (a, b, c), where a is the amplitude for the eigenstate with eigenvalue ħ, b for 0, and c for -ħ. 

Let me compute the expectation value ⟨P_z⟩. Since the state is expressed in the eigenbasis of P_z, the expectation value is just the weighted sum of the eigenvalues with the probabilities as weights.

Wait, no. The expectation value is the sum of each component squared (the probabilities) multiplied by their corresponding eigenvalues.

So, each component |a|^2 is the probability of being in the corresponding eigenstate. So |a|^2 is ( (-1/2) )^2 = 1/4. Similarly, |b|^2 is (1/√2)^2 = 1/2, and |c|^2 is ( (-1/2) )^2 = 1/4.

So ⟨P_z⟩ = (1/4)*ħ + (1/2)*0 + (1/4)*(-ħ) = (1/4 -1/4)ħ + 0 = 0 ħ.

Wait, that's interesting. So the expectation of P_z is zero.

Now, what about ⟨P_z²⟩? Since P_z squared would just be the squares of the eigenvalues because P_z is diagonal. So each eigenstate's eigenvalue squared is (ħ)^2, 0^2=0, and (-ħ)^2=ħ².

So ⟨P_z²⟩ is the sum of the probabilities multiplied by the squared eigenvalues.

So that would be (1/4)* (ħ²) + (1/2)*0 + (1/4)* (ħ²) ) = (1/4 + 1/4) ħ² = (1/2) ħ².

So now, putting it into the uncertainty formula:

ΔP_z = sqrt( ⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩² ) = sqrt( (1/2 ħ²) - (0) ) = sqrt(1/2 ħ²) = (ħ) * sqrt(1/2) = ħ/(√2).

So the uncertainty is ħ over root 2.

Looking at the options, option B is ħ/√2. So that's the answer.

Wait, but wait a second. Did I make any mistake in calculating ⟨P_z⟩? Because the state is given as a vector in the P_z basis. So the expectation value is indeed the sum of |a|² * eigenvalue for each component.

Yes, because in the eigenbasis, the expectation is straightforward. So I think I did that correctly.

Another way
