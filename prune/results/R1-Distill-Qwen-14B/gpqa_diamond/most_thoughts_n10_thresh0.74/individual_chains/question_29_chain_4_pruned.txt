Okay, so I've got this genetics question here. Let me read through it carefully.

The question is about a drought-resistant barley cultivar that has an anti-nutritional compound. The gene responsible has five exons and four introns. The goal is to find which mutation would eliminate the compound. They used EMS mutagenesis and sequenced the target gene in mutants. The changes are in the first exon.

Hmm, so the question is about point mutations and their effects. The intact gene is given, and there are four mutants. I need to figure out which mutation would disrupt the gene product, probably leading to a nonfunctional compound, thus eliminating the anti-nutritional issue.

Let me think about how mutations affect genes. Amino acid changes can occur if the DNA change leads to a substitution. If the change is in a critical region, like a coding area, it might disrupt the protein structure.

Looking at the sequences:

The intact gene starts with ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’.

The mutants have changes in the first exon area. Exons are coding regions, so any mutation here could affect the protein.

Let's look at each mutant's sequence.

Mutant 1:
5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Comparing to intact, let's see:
Intact: ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...
Mutant 1: ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC...

Looking at the first part. Let me line them up.

Intact starts with ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT...
Mutant1: ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT...

Wait, so the first part: positions where the change is?

Wait, perhaps the first few codons. Let me compare:

Intact:
ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG TGA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT…

Mutant1:
ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG TGA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC…

So, in the intact gene, the first few codons are:

ATG (start, Met), TTT (Phe), CTC (Leu), GCT (Ala), GGT (Gly), ACT (Thr), TCT (Ser), GTG (Val), TGA (stop? Or is this in frame? Wait, the TGA is at the end, so it's the stop codon. Wait, the provided sequences have the TGA at the end. So the last part is …TGA-3'.

So, looking at the beginning, let's see:

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG TGA …
Mutant1: ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG TGA …

So, let's break down the changes:

First codon after ATG:

Intact: TTT (Phe)
Mutant1: TTC (Phe). So same amino acid. No change.

Second codon:

Intact: CTC (Leu)
Mutant1: TAC (Tyr). So different. So the second codon changes from Leu to Tyr.

Wait, but wait, let me make sure I'm not getting the codons wrong. Because the sequences are written as DNA, but the codons are mRNA, which is complementary to the DNA.

Wait, no. Wait, the gene is DNA. The mRNA is made from the template strand, which is complementary to the coding strand. So when looking at the coding strand, the DNA sequence is the same as the mRNA, except T for U.

Wait, but in the question, the given sequences are the coding strands (since they have ATG as start, which is the same in mRNA as AUG).

So, the DNA sequence provided is the coding strand. So, the mRNA would be identical except U instead of T. So, for example, the first codon is ATG, which is the start codon in mRNA.

So
