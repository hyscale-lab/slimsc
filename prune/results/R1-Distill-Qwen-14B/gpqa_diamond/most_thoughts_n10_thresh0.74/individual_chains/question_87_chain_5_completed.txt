Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about identifying the correct 1H NMR spectrum for a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. The compound has 8 carbon atoms in total. The FTIR shows peaks for a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond. Hmm, so I need to think about what that implies.

First, let me break down the information given. The compound is a di-substituted benzene ring, meaning there are two substituents attached to the ring. The ring itself is six-membered, like benzene. The total number of carbon atoms is 8. Benzene has 6 carbons, so the substituents must add up to 2 more carbons. Wait, but substituents can sometimes be more complicated. Let's see.

The substituents include a carbonyl group (C=O) and a halogen (like Cl, Br, etc.) since the IR shows peaks for both. Since it's a di-substituted benzene, each substituent is attached to the ring once. So, two substituents: one is a carbonyl group, the other is an aromatic halogen, like an aryl halide.

Wait, but the substituents can't both be on the ring. Oh wait, no, the substituents are attached to the benzene. So, the ring has groups like -CO-something and a -X (halide) group. Or maybe one substituent is a carbonyl-containing group, and the other is a halogen.

Wait, but the way the question is phrased, it says "peaks indicate a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond." So the compound has both a carbonyl (like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, etc.) and a halogen attached to the aromatic ring.

So, the substituents on the benzene are a carbonyl-containing group and a halogen. Let me think about possible structures. For example, maybe one substituent is an acetyl group (COCH3) and the other is a halide (like Cl).

Wait, but let's count the carbons. Benzene has 6 carbons. The substituents have a total of 2 carbons. So each substituent must contribute one carbon. Let's see: the acetyl group is O-CO-CH3. That's two carbons (the carbonyl carbon and the methyl). But wait, the substituents can't both be that since that would add 2 carbons each, which would make more than 8. Oh wait, the total is 8 carbons including the ring.

Wait, benzene is 6 carbons. The substituents add 2 more, so each substituent is one carbon. But wait, a carbonyl group is a functional group—could it be a ketone attached directly, like a benzoyl group? No, wait, benzoyl is a substituent with a carbonyl attached to the ring, like Ar-C=O. But that would be one substituent with one carbon (the carbonyl), but then the other substituent would have one carbon as well.

Wait, maybe the substituents are a halide (like Cl, which is one atom but doesn't add a carbon) and another group. Wait, but that doesn't fit the 8 carbons. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are a carbonyl-containing group and a halogen. The halogen is attached directly, so that's one substituent (like -Cl), and the other substituent is a carbonyl group. But if the carbonyl group is attached as a substituent, it's like a ketone group, which would require more carbons.

Wait, maybe the substituents are a carbonyl group (like a ketone) and a halogen. Let's say the substituents are -CO-R and -X, but R has to be a group that adds up to 8 carbons total. Wait, the benzene is 6 carbons. Substituent 1: CO-R, where R is one carbon (like Me). So substituent 1 is COCH3 (which is two carbons: the CO and the CH3). Substituent 2: X (like Cl), which is one atom but zero carbons. So total carbons: 6 (benzene) + 2 (from COCH3) + 0 (Cl) = 8. That fits!

So the structure is a benzene ring with two substituents: one is an acetyl group (COCH3) and the other is a halogen, say Cl. So it would be something like para-substituted, for example, with the groups opposite each other.

Wait, but the substituents could be in any positions. But the di-substituted benzene would have the substituents in either para, ortho, or meta positions. But the NMR data would vary based on that.

Now, looking at the options, each has different signals. Let's think about what the NMR would look like.

In the case where the substituents are -COCH3 and -Cl on the benzene ring.

The aromatic protons would show up as a pair of doublets (if para) because the substituents are deactivating and meta-directing. So, in para substitution, the aromatic protons would be two sets of doublets. Let's imagine that.

The acetyl group (COCH3) would have a singlet for the methyl group, around δ 2.1-2.6 ppm. But wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, if the substituent is an aldehyde (CHO), that would have a strong peak around 9-10 ppm as a singlet. But in this case, the substituent is a ketone (COCH3), so the methyl group would be around 2.6 ppm as a singlet. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is an ester, but the question says a carbonyl group, so it could be any.

Wait, the IR shows a carbonyl, so the substituent is a carbonyl-containing group. So, possible groups: ketone (COCH3), aldehyde (CHO), ester (COOR), acid (COOH), etc. But considering the NMR options, some have a singlet around 2 ppm, others have a singlet around 9.9 ppm.

Option A: 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s). So, a singlet at 9.9 ppm. That could be an aldehyde proton (CHO), which is a singlet. But if the substituent is an aldehyde, that would be a substituent with a CHO group attached. Let's think about that.

But wait, if the substituent is -CHO, then the structure would be benzaldehyde with another substituent, like Cl. So the di-substituted benzaldehyde. The aromatic protons would be deshielded and split into doublets if para. The aldehyde proton would be a singlet around 9.8-10 ppm. Then, the methyl group from the COCH3 would be a singlet around 2.6, but in option A, there's a singlet at 3.7 ppm for 2H. Wait, that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a methoxy group (OCH3), but that's not a carbonyl.

Wait, let me review the options again.

Option A: 9.9 (1H, s) → possible aldehyde proton.
Then 7.8 and 7.6 are doublets, probably aromatic protons.
3.7 ppm (2H, s) → maybe a OCH2 group? Or perhaps a -OCH3? No, because that's 3H. Wait, 2H, so maybe a -CH2-O- group, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a ketone group. Let me think. If the substituent is a ketone (COCH3), then the methyl group would be a singlet around 2.6 ppm. But in option A, the singlet is at 3.7 ppm for 2H. Hmm, that doesn't match. So maybe option A is not the correct one.

Option C: 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s). The 2.3 ppm singlet for 3H could be a methyl group attached to a carbonyl, like COCH3. The aromatic signals are doublets, suggesting a para-substituted structure. So this could fit a para-substituted benzene with a carbonyl group and a halogen.

Wait, but in that case, the other substituent is a halogen (like Cl). So the substituents are -COCH3 and -Cl. The aromatic protons would be deshielded and split into two doublets if para. The COCH3 would be a singlet around 2.3. But wait, the NMR in option C has 7.8 and 7.6 ppm as doublets, each 2H. That makes sense for a para-substituted di-substituted benzene. For example, the substituents would cause the ring to have two sets of equivalent protons, each as doublets.

So, the aromatic protons would be split into two doublets, each integrating to 2H, and a singlet for the COCH3. So option C would fit: 7.8 (d, 2H), 7.6 (d, 2H), and 2.3 (s, 3H).

But wait, in that case, the IR would have a peak for the carbonyl (C=O) and another for the Cl (aromatic-halogen bond). So that seems to fit.

But wait, the question says the compound has 8 carbons in total. Let me count. The benzene has 6, the COCH3 adds 2 carbons (CO and CH3), and the Cl adds 0. So total 6+2=8. That works.

So option C would be a benzene ring with a COCH3 group and a Cl group in para positions. The NMR shows the aromatic protons as two doublets (each 2H), and the COCH3 as a singlet (3H).

Another option is option A. Let me think about that. Option A has a singlet at 9.9 ppm, which usually corresponds to an aldehyde proton. So if the substituent is -CHO, that would be one substituent. The other substituent would be a halogen, say Cl.

In that case, the structure would be a di-substituted benzaldehyde with Cl. The aromatic protons would again be in a para arrangement, leading to two doublets (each 2H). The aldehyde proton would be a singlet at about 9.9 ppm. The COCH3 would be 3H but at a higher ppm. Wait, but option A has 3.7 ppm for 2H. Hmm, that doesn't fit because a CH3 group from COCH3 would be around 2.6 ppm and be a singlet. So option A's NMR doesn't match because the singlet is at 3.7.

Wait, another possibility. Maybe the substituent isn't COCH3 but something else. Like, perhaps the substituent is an ester group, like OAc (OAc is O-CO-CH3). But that would add more carbons. Wait, OAc is O-CO-CH3, which is two carbons. So benzene (6) + OAc (2) + Cl (0) = 8. But then, the other substituent has to be something else. Hmm, no, wait, each substituent is on the benzene. So two substituents: OAc and Cl. That would make 6 + 2 (OAc) + 0 (Cl) = 8. So that's possible.

In that case, the ester group (OAc) would have the CH3 group as a singlet around 2.1 ppm. But that's not in option A. Option A's singlet is at 3.7, which is more like an OCH2 group or maybe a CH2O group. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a methoxy group, but that's not a carbonyl.

Wait, but the IR indicates a carbonyl, so if it's an ester, the carbonyl would be present. So in the case of an ester substituent, the NMR would have a singlet for the methyl group of the ester (O-CO-OCH3? No, wait, OAc is O-CO-CH3, so the methyl group would be a singlet at around 2.1 ppm. But none of the options have that except option A, which has a singlet at 3.7. So perhaps that's not the case.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a nitro group. Wait, but that doesn't have a carbonyl. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a ketone (CO-) attached to the benzene, but maybe with a longer chain. Wait, but the total carbons are 8. Let me think again.

Benzene (6) + substituent 1 (COCH3, 2 carbons) + substituent 2 (Cl, 0) = 8. So that's correct.

So substituent 1 is COCH3. So in the NMR, the COCH3 would appear as a singlet at about 2.6 ppm (3H). Looking at the options, option C has a singlet at 2.3 ppm (3H), which is in that range. So option C's NMR would fit.

But wait, what about the aromatic protons? If the substituents are COCH3 and Cl in para positions, then the aromatic protons would be in two sets of doublets. Each set being two protons, each as a doublet. So the NMR would show two doublets at around 7.8 and 7.6 ppm. That's exactly what option C shows. So option C has 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d). That fits a para-substituted benzene with two substituents that are deactivating and meta-directing, leading to the aromatic protons being in two doublets.

So, option C would have the correct NMR.

Wait, but what about the other options? Let me check.

Option D: 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s). That looks like a singlet for an aromatic proton, which would happen if the substituents are in a meta position and cause only one proton to be equivalent. But that doesn't fit with the di-substituted benzene with two substituents. Also, the signals at 4.8 and 4.6 ppm are typical for vinyl protons or perhaps OCH2 groups. Not sure how that fits with the carbonyl and halogen.

Option B: 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s). This looks like a structure with an ethylene group or a CH2 group adjacent to an oxygen, like OCH2CH2O. But again, I don't see how that would fit with the carbonyl and halogen on the benzene.

Option A: 9.9 (1H, s) suggests an aldehyde proton. Then the aromatic protons are doublets. The 3.7 ppm is a singlet of two protons. That could be a methylene group attached to an oxygen, like OCH2O. But without a carbonyl group in the substituent, unless it's part of an ester or something, I'm not sure. But considering the carbonyl is present, perhaps the substituent is an ester, but I can't fit it.

So, based on this, option C seems to fit the scenario: a para-substituted benzene with a COCH3 and a Cl group. The NMR shows the aromatic protons as two doublets (each 2H), and the COCH3 as a singlet (3H, 2.3 ppm).

Wait, another point: the IR shows a peak for an aromatic-halogen bond, which would be around 600 cm^-1 for the C-Cl stretch. So that's present. The carbonyl would be around 1700 cm^-1, which is also present.

So the correct structure is a para-substituted benzene with COCH3 and Cl. The NMR would show the aromatic protons as a pair of doublets, and the COCH3 as a singlet.


The compound in question is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring with 8 carbon atoms in total. The FTIR spectrum indicates the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond (C-X). This suggests the benzene ring has two substituents: one containing a carbonyl group and the other a halogen (e.g., Cl). The total carbon count includes the benzene ring (6 carbons) and the substituents, which must add 2 carbons in total. Therefore, the substituents are likely a carbonyl-containing group (e.g., -COCH₃) and a halogen (-Cl).

### Analysis of the Options:
1. **Option A**:  
   - Peaks: 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s).  
   - The singlet at 9.9 ppm suggests an aldehyde proton (-CHO), but the singlet at 3.7 ppm (2H, s) does not match the expected NMR for a COCH₃ group, which would appear as a singlet around 2.6 ppm. This option does not fit the structure.

2. **Option B**:  
   - Peaks: 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s).  
   - These signals suggest a structure with a methylene group adjacent to an oxygen (e.g., OCH₂CH₂O), which is inconsistent with the presence of a carbonyl group and a halogen on the benzene ring. This option is incorrect.

3. **Option C**:  
   - Peaks: 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s).  
   - The two doublets at 7.8 and 7.6 ppm correspond to aromatic protons in a para-substituted benzene ring. The singlet at 2.3 ppm (3H, s) matches the methyl group of a COCH₃ substituent. This option fits the structure of a para-substituted benzene with -COCH₃ and -Cl substituents.

4. **Option D**:  
   - Peaks: 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s).  
   - The singlet at 6.9 ppm suggests an aromatic proton in a meta-substituted benzene, which does not match the para-substitution expected for this compound. Additionally, the signals at 4.8 and 4.6 ppm suggest a structure with a methylene group adjacent to an oxygen, which is inconsistent with the given substituents. This option is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The correct structure is a para-substituted benzene ring with a -COCH₃ group and a -Cl substituent. The NMR data in **Option C** matches this structure: the aromatic protons appear as two doublets (7.8 ppm and 7.6 ppm), and the COCH₃ group appears as a singlet at 2.3 ppm.

**Answer: C**
