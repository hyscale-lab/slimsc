Okay, so I have this genetics question here about barley and some gene mutations. Let me try to think this through step by step. Alright, the question is about a drought-resistant barley cultivar that has an anti-nutritional compound. The gene responsible has five exons and four introns. They used EMS mutagenesis, which I remember is a chemical mutagen that typically causes point mutations, often leading to changes in amino acids.

The goal is to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. So, they’re looking for a mutation that disrupts the gene's function, probably by causing a premature stop codon or a significant change in the protein structure.

Looking at the options, let me look at each mutant:

The wild-type gene starts with 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’. Let's break down each mutant.

Mutant 1:
5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Comparing to wild-type, the first part is ATGTTTCT... becomes ATGTTCTA... Wait, let me look. The wild-type first exons have ATGTTTCTC..., while Mutant 1 is ATGTTCTAC. So, the third and fourth nucleotides are changing. Wait, let me count. Wild-type: positions 1-10 maybe? Maybe I should line them up.

Wild-type first part: ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...
Mutant 1: ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC...

So, looking at the first exon, I see a change at the 4th or 5th position. Wild-type has TTT CTC, and mutant has TTC TAC. Let me see the exact positions. Hmm, maybe it's a substitution in one of the codons.

Mutant 2:
5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Same as Mutant 1 up until some point. Oh, wait, their first exons are similar. Wait, the wild-type is CT CGC, and Mutant 2 is CT AAG. So in the first exon, perhaps a few changes. Wait, maybe a substitution from CGC to AGC, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the reading frame is changed.

Mutant 3:
5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’
Here, I see that in the wild-type, the sequence after ATGTTT is CTC GCT GGT ACTTCTG... In Mutant 3, it's TTA CGC TGG TGT C... Wait, the third codon in the mutant is TTACG instead of TTCTC. Wait, let me count:

Wild-type starts with ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG TGA ... So maybe the first few codons are Met, Phe, Leu,
