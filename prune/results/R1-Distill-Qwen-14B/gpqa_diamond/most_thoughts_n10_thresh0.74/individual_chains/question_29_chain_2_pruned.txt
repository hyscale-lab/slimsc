Okay, so I've got this genetics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

So, the question is about a drought-resistant barley cultivar that has an anti-nutritional compound. The gene responsible for this compound has five exons and four introns. The person wants to eliminate this compound by using EMS mutagenesis, which causes mutations. They sequenced the target gene in all mutants and found some changes in the first exon area. The goal is to find which mutation would most likely eliminate the compound.

Hmm, so the key here is that the anti-nutritional compound is produced due to the gene's function. If the gene is non-functional, the compound won't be synthesized. So, we're looking for a mutation that disrupts the gene's function.

Looking at the options, we have four mutants (1-4) and the intact gene. I need to compare each mutant's sequence to the intact gene to see where the mutations are and what effect they might have.

Let me write down the sequences for clarity.

Intact gene:
5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Mutant 1:
5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

Mutant 2:
5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

Mutant 3:
5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Mutant 4:
5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Wait, I notice that the sequences are a bit long, but I can compare them by looking for differences. I'll go through each mutant one by one.

Starting with the intact gene, the first part is ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGT... Let's compare each mutant line by line.

Mutant 1:

Compare to the intact gene. Let's see:

Intact: ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGT...
Mutant 1: ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGT...

Looking at the beginning, the intact gene has ATGTTT CTCGCT. Mutant 1 has ATGTTCTACGCT. Wait, maybe I should align them.

Let me line them up:

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT G
Mutant1: ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT G

Wait, perhaps it's better to look at each nucleotide position.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to count where the changes are. Let's look for the first part where they differ.

In the intact gene: the first part is ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-
