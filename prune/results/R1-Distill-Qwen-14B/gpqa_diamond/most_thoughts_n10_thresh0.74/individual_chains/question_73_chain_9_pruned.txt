Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about relativistic speeds and energy. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think through it.

The question says there are two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. I need to find the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. The options are A to D, so I'll have to calculate both the relative velocity and the total energy.

Wait, relative speed in relativity isn't just subtracting the two velocities like in classical mechanics. Right, because of the relativistic velocity addition formula. Oh right, the formula is (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/(c²)). So u would be the velocity of one astronaut relative to the other, but wait, I think I have to specify the frame of reference.

Let me think: If I'm looking for the speed of astronaut B as seen from astronaut A's frame, then u is 0.6c (A's speed) and v is 0.5c (B's speed). But wait, no, wait. Because both are moving in the same direction. So if A is moving at 0.6c and B at 0.5c, then from A's frame, B is moving at a relative speed of 0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c? But wait, no, because relativity doesn't work that way. Because when velocities are a significant fraction of c, you can't just subtract them. So I have to apply the relativistic formula.

So formula time. The relative velocity v_rel = (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)), where u is the velocity of the first object (Astronaut A is moving at 0.6c in the lab frame?), and v is the second (0.5c). Wait, but wait: in the lab frame, both are moving in the same direction. So from A's perspective, what's B's speed?

Wait, actually, no. Because in the lab frame, A is moving at 0.6c, B at 0.5c. But when you switch to A's frame, you have to consider that B is moving slower. Wait, no, if in the lab frame, both are moving in the same direction, then from A's perspective, B is moving at (v - u)/(1 - v u / c² )? Wait, maybe
