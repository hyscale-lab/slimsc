Okay, so I have this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, my brain is a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

Wait, the astronauts have masses 2m and 3m, right? And they're moving at 0.6c and 0.5c in the positive x-direction. So, the question is asking for two things: the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

First, I think I need to figure out their relative speed. But wait, in relativity, velocities don't just add up normally, right? Like, if one is moving at 0.6c and the other at 0.5c, you can't just subtract them to get 0.1c because that's way over the speed limit of light. Oh wait, actually, in relativity, the relative velocity calculation is more involved.

The formula for relative velocity in special relativity is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/c²). So in this case, v1 is 0.6c and v2 is 0.5c. Let me plug those numbers in.

Calculating numerator: 0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c.
Denominator: 1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c². Let's compute that. (0.3c²)/c² is 0.3, so 1 - 0.3 = 0.7.
So the relative speed is (0.1c) / 0.7 = approximately 0.1428c. Wait, that's roughly 0.14c if we round to two decimal places. So looking at the options, options C and D have v_rel as 0.14c. So that's a clue.

Next, the total energy of the system. Hmm, relativistic energy. Each astronaut's energy is their rest mass energy multiplied by gamma, right? So E_total = E1 + E2.

Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). For the first astronaut, v=0.6c. So 1 - (0.6)^2 = 1 - 0.36 = 0.64. sqrt(0.64)=0.8. So gamma is 1/0.8=1.25. His mass is 2m, so E1 = gamma * m_rest * c². Wait, wait, wait. Wait, the rest mass energy is m*c², but here the masses are 2m and 3m. So E1 would be 2m * gamma1 * c². Similarly, E2 is 3m * gamma2 * c².

Wait, no, no. Wait, the total energy is the sum of each object's total energy. Each object's energy is gamma times its rest mass energy. So for the first astronaut, E1 = gamma1 * (2m) c². Similarly, E2 = gamma2 * (3m) c². So I'll calculate each gamma.

Gamma for 0.6c: v = 0.6c, so v²/c² = 0.36. 1 - 0.36 = 0.64
