Okay, I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let's read the question again carefully.

The question is about the reaction of 1-bromobenzene-2-d with NaNH2 in a condensed ammonia solvent. I need to find out how many possible organic products are formed.

Hmm, first, I should probably figure out what the structure of the starting material is. The compound is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. Wait, the "d" here is a bit confusing. Oh, wait, sometimes the suffix "-d" is used in IUPAC nomenclature to denote a deuterium substitution. So, 1-bromobenzene-2-d would have a bromine on the benzene ring at position 1 and a deuterium (D) at position 2. Or is it maybe the other way around? Wait, no, the numbering would start from the bromine as position 1. So deuterium is on the adjacent carbon, position 2.

Wait, but benzene is a six-membered ring. So positions 1 and 2 are adjacent. So the structure would be bromine at position 1 and deuterium at position 2, making it a benzene ring with Br on C1 and D on C2.

But wait, sometimes the numbering could be different. Wait, in benzene, substituents can be numbered in a way that the substituents get the lowest possible numbers. So if the bromine is at position 1, then deuterium would be at position 2. Alternatively, maybe the deuterium is at position 3? No, wait,
