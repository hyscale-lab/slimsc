Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's break it down.

The starting compound is 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me draw that structure mentally. The cyclohexanone ring has a substituent at position 3: a hydroxymethyl group (-CH2OH). And at position 5, there's a prop-1-en-2-yl group. Wait, that's like a vinyl group attached with a branch. Prop-1-en-2-yl would be CH2-C(CH2)H? No, wait. Prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2-CH2-C=CH? Wait no. Propene is CH2=CHCH3. The prop-1-en-2-yl group is CH2CH2 with the double bond from 1 to 2. So, structure-wise, it's CH2-C(=CH2)- attached to the ring. Wait, maybe it's CH2=C-CH2- but attached how? Oh, wait, no. Prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2CH2 with a double bond between C1 and C2. So the group is CH2-CH2-C, but that doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps it's isopropenyl? Like CH2=C(CH3)-. Oh wait, prop-1-en-2-yl would be CH2CH2 with substituents. Let me think: the correct structure is CH2=C-CH2, but that's not possible. Alternatively, maybe it's CH2-CH(CH2)... No, perhaps it's CH2-C(CH2)=CH? Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The starting compound has a cyclohexanone ring, with a hydroxymethyl at C3 and a prop-1-en-2-yl at C5.

So the first step is treatment with sodium hydride, followed by benzyl bromide, forming product 1. Sodium hydride is a strong base, often used for deprotonating. But what's available to deprotonate here? The hydroxymethyl group has an -OH which is acidic. Sodium hydride would deprotonate the hydroxymethyl
