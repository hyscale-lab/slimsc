Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reaction mechanisms. Let's break it down step by step.

The problem starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane being heated with excess KOH. I remember that when vicinal dihalides (two halogens on adjacent carbons) react with a strong base like KOH, they undergo an elimination reaction, typically forming an alkene. Since adamantane is a pretty rigid structure, the dihalide is probably set up for a double elimination. So, the product here should be 1,3-adamantadiene or something similar. Wait, but wait—adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so if you lose two bromides, you form a double bond. The product would be 1,3-dibromo becoming 1,3-diene? Or maybe it's a ring-opening? Hmm, no, adamantane is a fused cyclohexane structure, right? So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have Br on two adjacent carbons. Heating with KOH would likely dehydrohalogenate twice to form a diene. The product being a light yellow solid suggests maybe an alkene, possibly a conjugated diene. The NMR data supports that: a peak at 4.79 ppm for 2H. That's probably a CH2 group adjacent to an oxygen, like an ether or maybe an epoxide? Wait, but wait another thought. The IR spectrum shows a characteristic absorbance at 1720 cm-1. That's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Oh wait, so maybe it's not elimination but some kind of substitution. Wait, KOH is a strong base and a good nucleophile. If the molecule is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, each Br is on a bridgehead carbon in adamantane, which is actually a very hindered environment. So substitution might not be feasible because of the poor accessibility of the bridgehead. So elimination is more likely, but then why the IR shows a carbonyl?

Alternatively, perhaps after elimination, some further reaction happens. Wait, but KOH is a base, not an acid. Hmm. Wait, maybe the initial reaction is elimination, forming a diene, but then if there's another reaction, perhaps a hydrolysis? No, KOH is in excess, so more elimination than substitution. Let me reconsider.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the reaction is not elimination but substitution, but that's tricky for adamantane's bridgehead. Alternatively, perhaps the dihalide upon treatment with KOH undergoes a dehydrohalogenation twice to form a diene. But then, the product would have a double bond, which would have a lower molecular weight. But the IR shows a carbonyl, which is unexpected for an alkene. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Another possibility: perhaps the dihalide undergoes a substitution, but with two equivalents of OH-. So each Br is replaced by OH, forming a diol. But for that, the structure would have two OH groups. Then, in the IR, the broad O-H stretch would be present, but the question says the characteristic absorbance is at 1720, which is more like a carbonyl. So that doesn't fit. Unless the diol undergoes some elimination after substitution, but that would bring us back to the alkene, which doesn't explain the carbonyl.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. The IR at 1720 cm-1 is a strong, medium absorption. Could it be a ketone or an ester? But where would that come from? Oh, wait! Oh wait, maybe the dihalide is undergoing an elimination to form an epoxide? No, I don't think so. Alternatively, perhaps it's a pinacol-like rearrangement, but that requires vicinal diol. Hmm.

Wait, another approach. Let's look at the NMR data for product 1. The protons are split into 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). The 10H in the middle region suggests that those are probably the adamantane ring protons, which are usually around 1.5-2.5 ppm. The 4.79 ppm is a singlet for 2H, maybe an oxygen-bearing group. Wait, another thought: perhaps it's a geminal diol? But that would require two OH groups on the same carbon, which isn't typical for KOH. Or maybe an epoxide, but the epoxide protons are usually around 3.5-4.5 ppm as a triplet or something else.

Wait, but the IR has a carbonyl. So, maybe it's a ketone. How does that happen from a dihalide? Maybe the dihalide is converted into a diketone. But that would require two dehydrohalogenations to form two carbonyl groups. But 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have Br on adjacent carbons. So if each Br is replaced by a carbonyl group, that would require each carbon losing H and Br, forming a ketone. But in adamantane, each bridgehead is a CH2 group. Wait, no, adamantane's bridgehead are CH groups. So, if you have 1,3-dibromo, each bridgehead has a Br. Replacing each Br with an O would give a dione? But then, the product would be a diketone, which has two carbonyl groups.

Wait, but the initial reaction is with KOH. So, perhaps it's a double elimination, but forming a conjugated diene. But then, why the IR shows a carbonyl? Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the dihalide is converted into a carbonyl via some kind of oxidation. But KOH is a base, not an oxidizing agent. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the initial product is not from substitution but elimination. So, let's think: 1,3-dibromoadamantane → when treated with KOH, eliminates HBr twice to form a diene. The diene would have two double bonds? Or a single double bond spanning between the two carbons where the Brs were. But wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane—so if each Br is on C1 and C3, elimination would form a double bond between C1 and C2, and another between C2 and C3? No, that's probably not likely. Wait, elimination would typically form a double bond between adjacent carbons, but in a rigid structure, maybe it's forming a conjugated diene.

But then, where does the carbonyl come from? Hmm. Maybe I've made a wrong assumption about the first reaction. Let me think again.

Alternative approach: perhaps the first step is a substitution, but not a simple SN2. But bridgehead substitution is difficult, so perhaps it's an E2 elimination. So, the dihalide undergoes two E2 eliminations, losing two HBr molecules, forming a diene. The product would be 1,3-adamantadiene, I suppose.

Now, moving to the IR spectrum of product 1: the 1720 cm-1 peak is a strong indication of a carbonyl group. But if product 1 is a diene, then why the carbonyl? Hmm, that's confusing. Maybe I'm wrong about the product.

Wait, perhaps the product is a bicyclic ether. Wait, but KOH would deprotonate and maybe form an epoxide. But without an oxygen source, that's not possible. Alternatively, maybe the dihalide is treated with KOH to form a diol, but that would have O-H stretches in the IR, which I don't see mentioned. Alternatively, perhaps it's a ketone. Wait, but how?

Wait a minute! Maybe the dihalide is treated with KOH in a different way. Let's think: 1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH could undergo a double substitution, but each substitution would require a good leaving group. However, bridgehead substitution is not favorable. So perhaps elimination is the way to go. But then the product would not have a carbonyl. So maybe I'm missing something else.

Wait, perhaps the carbonyl is from the hydroxide acting as a base, but then maybe another reaction occurs. Wait, another possibility: could the dihalide, when heated with KOH, undergo a dehydrohalogenation to form a carbonyl? No, that's more like what happens in the Oppenauer oxidation, but that's for ketones to aldehydes. Alternatively, maybe the dihalide is converted into a diketone via a double elimination, but I'm not familiar with such a mechanism.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a diol. But then the IR would show O-H stretches, which are usually broad. The problem doesn't mention a broad peak, though. Wait, the IR data only mentions the 1720 cm-1, which is a sharp peak, so probably a carbonyl. So perhaps the product is a ketone.

Wait, another approach: maybe it's a double elimination, but the two adjacent carbons lose HBr and form a triple bond? No, that's less likely. Alternatively, maybe it's a conjugated diene. But then, how does the carbonyl come into play?

Wait, perhaps the product is a cyclopropane ring. But I'm not sure how that would form from a dihalide and KOH.

Alternatively, maybe the initial reaction isn't elimination but substitution. Let's think: KOH could substitute each Br with an OH group, giving a diol. But then, would that lead to a carbonyl? Maybe not. Unless, perhaps, the diol undergoes some kind of dehydration. But that would require acid, not base.

Wait, perhaps after the substitution to form the diol, another reaction occurs. For example, the diol could undergo a pinacol rearrangement, which would form a carbonyl. Pinacol rearrangement requires a 1,2-diol (vicinal diol) to undergo acid-catalyzed dehydration, forming a carbonyl. But in this case, the reaction is with KOH, which is a base, not an acid. So that might not happen.

Hmm, this is getting a bit tangled. Let's try to think about the NMR data again. Product 1 has signals at 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), and 1.94 (2H). The 10H in the middle are likely the adamantane ring protons. The 4.79 is a singlet for 2H, which suggests they are equivalent and perhaps attached to an oxygen. So if those two Hs are on an oxygen-bearing group, like an ether or an ester, but given the IR, it's more likely a carbonyl.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the dihalide is converted into a ketone via a double elimination, but that seems unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the dihalide is treated with KOH in such a way that each Br is replaced by an oxygen, forming a diketone. But for that to happen, you'd need each bridgehead to lose a Br and gain a carbonyl. But I'm not sure how that would proceed.

Alternatively, could the product be a ketone and an alkene? Or perhaps a cyclopropane ring with a ketone group? Hmm.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about possible structures. If product 1 has a carbonyl, maybe it's a ketone. For example, if one of the bridgehead carbons (originally with Br) now has a carbonyl group. But how would that happen from a dihalide?

Wait, another possibility: the dihalide is treated with KOH, and each Br is replaced by an O- group, but then perhaps those O- groups are oxidized to ketones. But I don't see anything in the reaction conditions that suggests oxidation—KOH is a base, not an oxidizing agent.

Wait, perhaps it's a double elimination, but the product has a conjugated diene, which then undergoes ozonolysis in a later step. But that's for product 2, not product 1.

Hold on, perhaps I should shift focus. The second step is treating product 1 with excess aluminum isopropoxide, forming product 2. Aluminum isopropoxide is a Lewis acid catalyst, often used in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. But product 1, if it's a diene, perhaps undergoes some kind of addition. Alternatively, if product 1 is a ketone, then maybe it's undergoing a Friedel-Crafts acylation. Wait, but product 1 is a solid, and product 2 is formed after treating with Al isopropoxide. Hmm.

Let me think about the third step: product 2 is treated with ozone at -78°C, followed by dimethyl sulfide. That sounds like an ozonolysis reaction. Ozone cleaves double bonds, breaking them into carbonyl groups. So product 3 would have carbonyl groups where the double bonds were.

But wait, the question is about the NMR of product 3, specifically the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen (excluding those that exchange). So, perhaps product 3 has some aldehyde or ketone groups, and the Hs adjacent to those would be deshielded.

Wait, let's try to piece it all together:

1. 1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH → product 1 (light yellow solid with IR at 1720 cm-1).

Given the IR, product 1 has a carbonyl group. So, perhaps it's a ketone. So, maybe the dihalide is converted into a diketone. How? Maybe each Br is replaced by a carbonyl group. But that would require each bridgehead carbon (originally with Br) to lose Br and gain a carbonyl. How?

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a double elimination, but with the formation of a conjugated diene, and then some kind of dienol formation. No, that doesn't directly lead to a ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps the dihalide undergoes a double dehydrohalogenation to form a conjugated diene, and then that diene is oxidized to a diketone. But oxidation would require an oxidizing agent, and KOH is a base.

Hmm, maybe I'm missing something in the first step.

Wait, perhaps it's a substitution reaction. If the dihalide undergoes substitution with KOH, but the hydroxide can't reach the bridgehead. So, maybe elimination is the main pathway. But then the product would be a diene without a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the initial product is a diene (from elimination), and then in the next step, when treated with Al isopropoxide, undergoes some kind of addition or reaction that introduces a carbonyl group.

Wait, let's move to the second step. Product 1 is treated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. Al isopropoxide is a Lewis acid, often used in Friedel-Crafts. So, perhaps product 1 is an aromatic compound, and product 2 is an acylated version. But product 1's NMR doesn't show any aromatic protons, so that's probably not the case.

Wait, another possibility: product 1 is a ketone, and when treated with Al isopropoxide, it undergoes some kind of enol ether formation or acylation. Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diol, and then Al isopropoxide helps in forming an acetal or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an epoxide. Then, treating with Al isopropoxide might not do much. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is a diene, and when treated with Al isopropoxide, it undergoes a diene synthesis, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but the third step is ozonolysis. Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds to form carbonyl groups. So product 2 must have a double bond. Therefore, product 1 must have a structure that, after reaction with Al isopropoxide, forms a compound with a double bond.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a ketone, and product 2 is an enol ether or something else with a double bond.

Wait, maybe product 1 is a diol, and when treated with Al isopropoxide, it loses water to form a double bond, making an alkene. Then, product 2 would have a double bond, which upon ozonolysis would cleave into carbonyl groups.

So, let's try to piece it together:

Step 1: 1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH → diol (1,3-adamantanediol) → but then why the IR shows carbonyl?

No, wait, maybe step 1 gives a diol, which is then treated with Al isopropoxide, leading to dehydration to form a diene (product 2). Then, ozonolysis of product 2 (the diene) would cleave it into two carbonyl compounds.

But let me think again: Step 1, after KOH, the product has a carbonyl. So maybe product 1 is a diketone.

Wait, if 1,3-dibromoadamantane undergoes two eliminations, each losing HBr, perhaps in a way that each Br is replaced by a carbonyl group. But how?

Alternatively, perhaps each Br is replaced by a -OH group, and then the diol is oxidized to a diketone. But oxidation isn't happening here, as the reagent is KOH.

Hmm, perhaps I'm stuck on the first step, so let me try to think about the overall process.

The overall process seems to be:

1. Elimination (possibly) to form a diene or a carbonyl-containing compound.

2. Reaction with Al isopropoxide, possibly forming a more complex structure with a double bond.

3. Ozonolysis of the double bond to form carbonyl groups.

In the NMR of product 3, we need to find the coupling pattern of the most deshielded H (probably adjacent to a carbonyl).

So, perhaps the original dihalide becomes a diene after step 1, which is then something else after step 2, and then step 3 cleaves that.

Wait, another approach: What if the first reaction is the formation of an epoxide? But then the IR would show an epoxide's C-O-C peak, which is around 1200 cm-1, but in the data, it's 1720, so that can't be.

Wait, perhaps the first reaction is a substitution where the Brs are replaced by ketone groups. But again, bridgehead substitution is difficult.

Wait, another thought—what if the dihalide is treated with KOH in a way that forms a conjugated diene, which then under certain conditions forms a carbonyl via some reaction? But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product 1 isn't from the dihalide but another reaction. Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane could undergo a coupling reaction, but with KOH, that's less likely.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a double dehydrohalogenation to form a cyclopropane ring with a carbonyl group. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, maybe the first step gives a conjugated diene. Then, when treated with Al isopropoxide, perhaps it undergoes a Diels-Alder reaction or some addition. But without a dienophile, that's not possible.

Wait, product 2 is then treated with ozone. Ozonolysis of a diene would give two carbonyl groups. So product 3 would have carbonyls. The H's adjacent to these carbonyls would be deshielded, so their NMR signals would be downfield.

The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded H (excluding those that exchange). So, let's imagine that in product 3, there's an aldehyde group (which would be the most deshielded H), but in the NMR, those Hs are usually sharp singlets because they exchange rapidly with D2O, but the question says to exclude those that exchange. Alternatively, maybe it's a ketone, and the adjacent Hs are split due to coupling.

Wait, but product 3 is formed after ozonolysis. Ozonolysis of a diene typically breaks the double bond into two carbonyl groups. So, if product 2 is a diene, product 3 would have two carbonyl groups. For example, if product 2 is 1,3-pentadiene, ozonolysis would give two aldehydes. But in our case, the starting material is adamantane-based, which is a polycyclic structure.

Wait, considering the structure, 1,3-dibromoadamantane is likely to form a conjugated diene upon elimination. So product 1 would be a diene. Then product 2, after Al isopropoxide, may undergo some reaction. Wait, but Al isopropoxide is a Lewis acid. Maybe it's used in a Friedel-Crafts alkylation, but if product 1 is a diene, perhaps it's used in some addition. Alternatively, maybe product 1 is a diol, and Al isopropoxide helps in forming a cyclic ether or something else. But I'm getting a bit stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step gives a ketone, product 1. Then, product 2 is a diene formed by some kind of elimination upon treatment with Al isopropoxide.

Wait, another thought: Maybe product 1 is a ketone, and when treated with Al isopropoxide, it undergoes a Claisen-Schmidt condensation, forming a conjugated enone (alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone). Then, product 2 would have a double bond adjacent to the carbonyl. Ozonolysis of that would cleave the double bond, but in the presence of a carbonyl, I think the ozonolysis would stop at the carbonyl, so the molecule might break into smaller fragments.

But I'm not sure. Let me think about the ozonolysis step. Ozonolysis of a conjugated enone (like an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone) would add ozone across the double bond, and then upon workup, typically with dimethyl sulfide (a reductive workup), it would break the ozonide into carbonyl groups. For an enone like R-CO-CH2-CH2-, ozonolysis would cleave into R-CO and another carbonyl group.

Wait, perhaps product 2 is an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone. Ozonolysis would then break the double bond, generating two ketone groups. The resulting product 3 would have two ketone groups.

In this scenario, the most deshielded H would be adjacent to a carbonyl. For example, if there's a CH2 group next to a carbonyl, each H on the CH2 would be split by coupling with neighboring Hs. For example, if the CH2 is between two carbonyls, each H would be coupled with the two Hs on the same CH2 and maybe with any adjacent Hs.

Wait, but in an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone, the structure is R-CO-CH2-CH2-CO-R', but that's just a guess. Alternatively, maybe it's a simple diene.

Wait, perhaps product 2 is a diene, and ozonolysis cleaves it into two carbonyl groups. So product 3 would have two carbonyls, each adjacent to a CH2 group. So in product 3, each CH2 next to a carbonyl would have their Hs split by coupling.

Wait, let's imagine product 2 is a diene such as 1,3-pentadiene. Ozonolysis would break it into two aldehyde groups: OHC-CHO. But in our case, the starting material is adamantane-based, so the diene is part of a more complex structure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is a monoene, and ozonolysis breaks it into two carbonyl groups, each adjacent to a CH2 group. So, for example, if product 2 is CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, ozonolysis would cleave it into two aldehydes: OHC-CH2-CH2-CHO. But that's a linear molecule, and in our case, it's probably a cyclic or bridged structure.

Wait, but the NMR data for product 3 is what we're concerned with. The most deshielded H is likely adjacent to a carbonyl group. Let's consider that after ozonolysis, each CH2 group next to a carbonyl will have their Hs split based on neighboring protons.

If the H is on a CH2 group next to a carbonyl, it might be coupled with Hs on adjacent CH2 groups. For example, a structure like O=C-R-CH2-CH2-CO=O would have the CH2 groups next to carbonyls. Each H on the CH2 would be adjacent to another CH2, leading to coupling.

Wait, but in reality, the structure after ozonolysis would depend on where the double bonds were in product 2. Let's try to imagine the structure:

Assume product 2 has a double bond between carbons A and B. Ozonolysis would cleave this into two carbonyls, each attached to the adjacent carbons.

So, if the structure was ...-A-B-..., ozonolysis would form ...-O=C-A and B-C=O-...

Each of these carbonyls would be adjacent to the original carbons that were connected to the double bond.

So, for example, if product 2 was a diene, say, with double bonds at positions 1 and 3, ozonolysis would break both, leading to several carbonyl groups.

But back to the NMR: the most deshielded H is likely a methylene (CH2) group next to a carbonyl. The coupling pattern would depend on how many neighboring Hs are present.

If a CH2 group is next to another CH2, each H on the first CH2 would couple with the two Hs on the adjacent CH2. That would give a triplet: each H would have two neighboring Hs, leading to a triplet.

Wait, but what if the CH2 is between two CH groups? Then each H on the CH2 would couple with two Hs (from the CH groups) and perhaps others. Alternatively, maybe the CH2 is adjacent to a CH group, leading to more complex splitting.

Alternatively, perhaps the CH2 is next to another CH2 group, which is next to a CH group. Then, each H on the first CH2 would couple with two Hs on the adjacent CH2, and perhaps one H on the next CH. That could lead to a triplet of triplets or some other pattern.

Wait, but in the ozonolysis product, if the structure is something like O=C-CH2-CH2-CO, then the CH2 groups next to the carbonyls would each have two neighboring Hs from the adjacent CH2 group. So each H on the CH2 would couple with two Hs, giving a triplet.

So, in product 3, the most deshielded H (on a CH2 next to a carbonyl) would be a triplet.

Looking at the options, option A is a triplet.

Wait, but let me think again. If the CH2 group is between two carbonyl groups, each H on the CH2 would have two neighboring Hs on the same CH2. So each H would couple with two others, leading to a triplet.

Alternatively, if the CH2 is adjacent to another group with more Hs, the splitting could be more complex.

Wait, considering the structure, perhaps the ozonolysis creates two separate carbonyl groups, each adjacent to a CH2 group. For example, suppose the diene in product 2 is between two CH2 groups. Ozonolysis would then create two carbonyls, each attached to a CH2. So, the structure would be O=C-CH2-CH2-CO. In this case, each CH2 group has two Hs, each of which would couple with the two Hs on the adjacent CH2 group.

So, each H on the CH2 would have a triplet pattern because each is split by two neighboring Hs.

Wait, but wait, each H is split by two neighboring Hs, but in a triplet, each line is split into a triplet. So, the integration would be 2H, and the splitting would be a triplet.

So, the most deshielded Hs (on the CH2 adjacent to carbonyl) would be a triplet.

Looking at the options, option A is a triplet.


The problem involves a multi-step reaction sequence starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Here's the analysis of each step and the reasoning behind the final answer:

1. **Step 1: Reaction with KOH**  
   The starting material, 1,3-dibromoadamantane, reacts with KOH. Given the IR spectrum of product 1 shows a strong absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is characteristic of a carbonyl group, the reaction likely involves the formation of a diketone. This suggests that two eliminations occur, each replacing a bromine atom with a carbonyl group, resulting in a diketone structure.

2. **Step 2: Reaction with Al isopropoxide**  
   Product 1, the diketone, is treated with excess aluminum isopropoxide. This step likely facilitates the formation of a conjugated enone (α,β-unsaturated ketone) via a reaction such as the Claisen-Schmidt condensation. The enone structure introduces a double bond adjacent to a carbonyl group.

3. **Step 3: Ozonolysis**  
   Product 2, the enone, undergoes ozonolysis at -78°C, followed by the addition of dimethyl sulfide. Ozonolysis cleaves the double bond in the enone, breaking it into two carbonyl groups. The resulting product 3 contains carbonyl groups, and the most deshielded hydrogen atoms are those on the CH₂ groups adjacent to these carbonyls.

4. **NMR Analysis of Product 3**  
   In the NMR spectrum of product 3, the most deshielded hydrogen atoms are on a CH₂ group adjacent to a carbonyl group. These hydrogens are coupled with the two hydrogens on the adjacent CH₂ group, resulting in a triplet splitting pattern. This is consistent with the coupling observed in the NMR data.

5. **Conclusion**  
   The coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom in product 3 is a triplet.

**Answer: A**
