Okay, so I'm trying to solve this NMR and LC-MS question, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The scenario is that there's a small peptidic compound synthesized, and when they look at its 1H NMR spectrum, it looks right except for two peaks that are both the same alpha-proton. These two peaks have similar shifts and integrate to 1H together. They also say that spin-spin coupling has been ruled out because the coupling pattern doesn't fit that. Then, the LC-MS analysis shows two peaks with the same mass, same intensity, and the same mass spectrum as expected.

Hmm. So the NMR is showing two peaks for a proton that should be a single peak. But why? And why the LC-MS is showing two peaks with the same mass? Let's think about the options.

Option A: Contaminated with a precursor. If it's a precursor, the mass would be different because the molecular weight would be higher (since a precursor is usually the starting material before a reaction step, maybe with one more group like an amino acid plus some protecting group). But the question says the mass is the same, so A might not be right.

Option B: Mixture of enantiomers. Enantiomers are mirror images and have the same physical properties except for how they interact with chiral environments. So in NMR, if the compound is a racemic mixture, but wait, for a single enantiomer, the alpha protons are equivalent, so you would see one peak. But if it's a mixture, you might not see a split because the peaks would average out. But in the question, the peaks are separate. Wait, but if the sample is a racemic mixture, the NMR might not show separate peaks because the protons are in equivalent environments for each enantiomer. Or maybe it's a different scenario? I'm a bit fuzzy on that.

Option C: Double coupling during amide bond formation. Double coupling, like maybe a proton is coupled to two different sets of protons? But in the question, they rule out spin-spin coupling. So that might not fit. Or perhaps it's something else, like the formation of two different diastereomers during the reaction which leads to different environments for the proton. Wait, but C is talking about double coupling, which is a different situation. Maybe if there's an issue during the reaction where the amide bond forms in two different ways, causing some coupling, but I'm not sure. I'll come back to this.

Option D: Mixture of diastereoisomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties, so their NMR spectra would show different peaks. If the sample is a mixture of diastereomers, each would have their own set of protons. But in this case, the peaks are the same mass, so the molecular weight is the same. Diastereomers would have the same molecular weight but different physical properties. So if it's a diastereomeric mixture, the NMR would show different shifts for each diastereomer's alpha protons. But then why two peaks with the same shift? Wait, the question says the two peaks have similar chemical shifts. So if the diastereomers have the same shift for that proton, perhaps they are not diastereomers in that position. Or maybe the diastereomers have similar environments for that proton. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, the LC-MS shows two peaks of same mass, which implies same molecular weight. So the compounds are isomers of some sort but have same molecular formula. Possible candidates are enantiomers or diastereomers.

But the question says that in the NMR, the two same alpha protons are giving two peaks. Why would that happen?

Wait, if the compound is a diastereomer mixture, each diastereomer would have their own set of protons. So in the NMR, each diastereomer would contribute their own peaks. But in the question, the two peaks are for the same alpha-proton. So both diastereomers have the same alpha-proton environment? Or maybe the diastereomers are such that the alpha protons are in similar environments, leading to similar shifts, but two sets of them. But the integral is 1H together—so each peak is about 0.5H? That doesn't make much sense because integrals are about the number of protons. So if the two peaks together integrate to 1H, each peak is 0.5H. But in reality, each proton in a diastereomer would have its own signal. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, another thought: if the sample is a racemic mixture, then in the NMR, the protons would appear as a single peak because the environment is symmetric. But wait, the question says the NMR has two peaks for the same alpha proton. So maybe it's not about enantiomers. Because for enantiomers, the same protons would have the same environment, so their NMR signals would overlap, giving a single peak. So B might not explain it.

Alternatively, if the compound is a mixture of diastereomers that are epimers at the alpha carbon. So, for example, if the configuration is R and S at the alpha position. Then, each diastereomer would have a different environment for the alpha proton. So you would see two separate peaks. But in that case, the shifts would be different, but the question says the shifts are similar, just two peaks. So maybe the diastereomers have very similar shifts, perhaps because the neighboring groups are similar. But then why would the LC-MS show two peaks with same mass?

Wait, the LC-MS analysis at elevated temperature shows two peaks of same mass. What could cause that? Maybe if the compound is a racemic mixture, but no, that wouldn't split the peak in LC-MS. Or, perhaps it's a case of isomerism where the compounds are separated by the LC, but have same mass. So diastereomers would have same molecular weight but different retention times. Enantiomers, same retention time because the column doesn't separate them. Wait, but in the question, the LC-MS shows two peaks of same mass, same intensity. So the molecules have same molecular weight but different structures, which could be diastereomers or enantiomers.

Wait, but if it's a racemic mixture, the LC might not separate them because they are enantiomers, so they might come out as a single peak. But if the column is chiral, then they would separate. Hmm, but the question says the LC-MS shows two peaks. So if it's a racemic mixture and the column is chiral, two peaks would appear. But the NMR would have a single peak because the two enantiomers are present together.

Wait, but in the NMR, you have two peaks for the same alpha proton. If it's a racemic mixture, the alpha protons would be equivalent in both enantiomers, so the NMR would show one peak, not two. So that can't be the case. Therefore, B is probably not the correct answer.

So looking back at the options, D is diastereomers. If the compound is a mixture of diastereomers, they would have same molecular weight, leading to same mass in LC-MS. The NMR would have different environments for some protons. But in the question, the two peaks are for the same alpha proton, which is confusing. Because each diastereomer would have their own set of alpha protons. So perhaps the two diastereomers each have an alpha proton that is equivalent, but in different environments.

Wait, but wait, in the case of diastereomers, the same proton in different environments will have different shifts. So for example, diastereomers where the alpha proton is in a different environment, but maybe their shifts are very close, so the peaks look similar but split. So the NMR would show two peaks for the same type of proton but in different environments. But the question says the two peaks have similar shifts. So this could fit.

But then, when they look at the LC-MS, why two peaks? Because the diastereomers have the same molecular formula, so same mass, but different structures, so the LC would separate them into two peaks. So why is the same mass spectrum? Because the mass is same, so the same m/z.

Wait, but the question says the mass spectrum is the same. Hmm. So if it's diastereomers, their fragmentation patterns could be the same or different, but in this case, the mass spectrum is the same. So that makes sense.

So, getting back to the NMR. The two peaks are for the same alpha proton. But each diastereomer has an alpha proton in a slightly different environment. So if the two diastereomers are present in equal amounts, each contributes a peak for that alpha proton, but with a very similar shift, but two separate peaks. So the integral would add up to 1H because each contributes 0.5H. Wait, that doesn't quite make sense because each molecule has one alpha proton. So for each diastereomer molecule, the alpha proton is present. If you have a 1:1 mixture, each contributes 1H, so together they would integrate to 2H. But the question says that together they integrate to 1H. Wait, that's confusing.

Wait, the question says the two peaks correspond to the same alpha-proton. Their integrals are roughly equal and together sum to 1H, which is the expected integral. So each peak is about 0.5H. That doesn't make sense because each molecule has one alpha proton. So if you have two diastereomers, each has one alpha proton, so in a 1:1 mixture, each contributes 1H. So together, the NMR would see 2H. But the question says the integral is 1H. So that doesn't add up. Hmm, maybe that's not the answer.

Wait, let me think again. The NMR shows two peaks for the same alpha proton, each with integral ~0.5H, so together 1H. That suggests that each peak is only 0.5H. How can that happen? Maybe the alpha-carbon is split into two environments, but each has half the protons. That doesn't make sense for a normal molecule. Unless there's some coupling or other issue.

Wait, another possibility: if the sample is a racemic mixture, but with a diastereomer as well. No, that's getting complicated.

Wait, the LC-MS shows two peaks with same mass but same intensity. So maybe it's a case where during the reaction, a different stereochemistry is formed, leading to diastereomers. That would cause the same mass and different retention times.

Wait, but earlier confusion about the NMR. Let me approach this from another angle.

The NMR has two peaks for the same alpha proton. Why? Maybe the protons are split into two due to some coupling. But the question says coupling has been ruled out. So that can't be it.

Another possibility is that the chemical shift is identical, but the peak is split into two because of something else. But it's unclear.

Wait, what if the compound has an impurity that has the same molecular weight but different structure? Then the LC-MS would show two peaks, but the NMR would have two sets of peaks. But the question says that the NMR is otherwise consistent except for the two peaks. So probably not an impurity because the mass would be same. But the NMR would have more peaks if it's an impurity.

Alternative idea: maybe the compound is a mixture of two diastereomers that are epimers at the alpha carbon. Each would have the same molecular formula, so same mass. The NMR would show two peaks for the alpha protons if the two diastereomers have different environments for that proton. But if the shifts are similar, maybe it's a case of diastereotopic protons or something else.

Wait, diastereotopic protons are a pair of non-equivalent protons that are mirror images of each other, but in a chiral environment. Hmm, but that's more about the same molecule.

Wait, another thought: If the compound is a mixture of two diastereomers, each with an alpha H in a slightly different environment, but the shifts are close enough. So each would contribute a peak, but same integral. Wait, but if each has one alpha H, then each would contribute 1H. So total integral would be 2H, but the question says the integral is 1H. So that's not matching.

Wait, maybe I'm not considering the possibility that in the diastereomers, there's another proton that's causing the issue. Or perhaps the splitting is due to another effect.

Wait, let's think about the options again. The question says that the two peaks in the NMR are from the same alpha-proton. So the same proton is split into two. But why?

Option C: 'Double coupling' during amide bond formation. So, perhaps the amide proton is involved in coupling with more than one set of protons. But the question says spin-spin coupling is ruled out. So this would imply that the splitting isn't due to coupling with neighboring protons. So maybe it's not a coupling issue.

Hmm. Another possibility: if the compound undergoes some tautomerism, but that would probably lead to different shifts and possibly varying peaks depending on conditions.

Wait, another angle: the LC-MS shows two peaks of same mass and intensity. So same molecular weight, same concentration. So the two compounds are isomers of some kind.

If the NMR shows two peaks for the same alpha proton, perhaps in each isomer, the alpha proton is in a slightly different environment. So each isomer contributes a peak, but same alpha proton.

So, perhaps the two compounds are diastereomers. Each has an alpha proton in a slightly different environment, leading to similar but separate peaks. The integral would be 1H for each, so together 2H. But the question says the integral is 1H. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe the two peaks are due to an internal rotation or something else. But that's more applicable to coupling.

Wait, let me consider the options again.

Option B: Enantiomers. In the NMR, a racemic mixture would have the same chemical shifts, so a single peak. But the question has two peaks, so probably not.

Option D: Diastereomers. So each diastereomer has an alpha proton in a different environment. So two peaks. Integrals each would be 1H, so total 2H. But the question says the integral is 1H. Hmm. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps the diastereomers are such that in each, the alpha proton is split into two? No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, maybe the problem is that the sample is a mixture of two diastereomers, but each has the same alpha proton environment. But why would that be?

Alternatively, maybe the doublet in the NMR is due to exchange between the two diastereomers—like a fast exchange process. But then the peaks would be broader but perhaps as a singlet. Not sure.

Wait, another thought: if the compound is a mixture of a linear and a cyclic form. But that would probably have more differences in the NMR.

Alternatively, perhaps the issue is with the synthesis. For example, if the amide bond formed incompletely, leading to some unreacted starting material. But the mass would be different, so the LC-MS wouldn't show same mass. So option A is probably not the right choice.

Wait, another scenario: during the synthesis, an intermolecular reaction occurred, leading to dimerization. But that would change the molecular weight, so LC-MS would show a higher mass. Not matching the question.

Wait, let me think about what's observed. Same molecular weight (so same mass), so no isotopic peaks. NMR shows two peaks for the same proton, same integral. So each peak is 0.5H. But that's impossible unless each molecule only has 0.5H of that proton, which doesn't make sense. So perhaps the problem is something else.

Wait, maybe the two peaks are due to a double bond or some other coupling, but the question says spin-spin coupling is ruled out.

Wait, perhaps the two peaks are due to a double bond coupling, but in a different scenario. Or maybe it's a case of equivalent protons in a different context.

Wait, maybe the molecule has an internal plane of symmetry, so the alpha protons are equivalent in some way but split due to other factors. Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is with the synthesis, and the crude product has some byproducts. But the mass is same, so perhaps it's a structural isomer.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the compound has a stereocenter elsewhere, but the alpha carbon is the same. Or perhaps the alpha carbon is a diastereotopic center, but I'm not clear on that.

Alternatively, the two peaks could be from a single diastereomer that has two different environments for the same proton, but that doesn't make sense because the same proton can't have two environments in the same molecule unless it's diastereotopic, which is a different scenario.

Wait, the question says the two peaks correspond to the same alpha-proton. So each peak is for the same proton. So that implies that each molecule has one of these protons, but in two different environments. But how?

Alternatively, maybe each molecule has two alpha protons, but that doesn't fit either because the question says the two peaks correspond to the same alpha-proton.

Wait, perhaps the problem is with the synthesis step. For example, if the amide bond forms in such a way that creates two different diastereomers. If the reaction forms an amide with two possible configurations, leading to diastereomers. Then, in the NMR, each diastereomer would have its own alpha proton environment, leading to two separate peaks.

But then, the integral would be 1H for each, making a total of 2H, but the question says it's 1H. So that's a problem.

Wait, unless each diastereomer has only half of the alpha protons, which doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, maybe the two peaks are due to the same diastereomer but in two different conformations. But conformations usually lead to broad peaks or overlapping, not separate peaks.

Hmm. I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to think of each option:

The NMR shows two peaks for same alpha proton. The integral is 1H.

The LC-MS shows two peaks of same mass and same intensity.

So the molecular weight is same. So the possible options are enantiomers or diastereomers.

But enantiomers would have same NMR shifts, so why two peaks? Because the question says the NMR has two peaks which can't be explained by coupling.

Wait, another point: the question says that the two peaks have similar shifts. So perhaps it's a case of diastereomers with similar but not identical shifts.

So the NMR shows two peaks, each from a diastereomer, each contributing 1H. But the question says that in total, it's 1H. So that's conflicting. Unless each diastereomer's alpha proton is present in 0.5H. Which isn't possible because each molecule has one alpha proton.

Wait, perhaps the two peaks are from a single diastereomer, but split due to some other coupling. But the question says spin-spin coupling is ruled out.

Another approach: perhaps the problem is with the synthesis, like the formation of a double bond or something else, but that would change the mass.

Wait, the options are:

A) Contaminated with a precursor. Unlikely, because the mass would be different.

B) Mixture of enantiomers. NMR would show single peak, so B is unlikely.

C) Double coupling during amide bond formation. Not sure, but coupling is ruled out.

D) Mixture of diastereoisomers. Two peaks in NMR, same mass in LC-MS.

But why the integral is 1H? Because each diastereomer contributes 0.5H? How? That doesn't make sense.

Wait, unless the diastereomers have more than one alpha proton that are equivalent. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the two diastereomers each have an alpha proton that are equivalent. Wait, that would make the NMR show a single peak, not two.

I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to eliminate options again.

Option A: precursor. Different mass, so no.

Option B: enantiomers. Same shifts, so NMR would have a single peak, but the question has two. So B is unlikely.

Option C: double coupling. But coupling is ruled out, so maybe C is not correct.

Option D: diastereomers. Same mass, so LC-MS shows two peaks. NMR shows two peaks for same alpha-proton. So each diastereomer has an alpha-proton in a slightly different environment, leading to two peaks. But the integral would be 2H, but question says 1H. So unless each diastereomer only contributes 0.5H, which doesn't make sense. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, the question says the two peaks have roughly equal integrals and together sum to 1H. So each is about ~0.5H. How can two peaks from the same proton each contribute 0.5H? Maybe each diastereomer has only 0.5H of that alpha-proton. But that's impossible because each molecule has one alpha proton.

Wait, maybe the test is about the presence of different diastereomers, but each has the same number of alpha protons. But then the integrals would add up to 2H.

Hmm.

Wait, maybe it's a case of epimerization at the alpha carbon during the analysis. But that would affect the NMR, but the question says the NMR was taken correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the alpha proton is split into two due to some other coupling, but the question says spin-spin is ruled out. So that's not it.

Wait, another thought: the two peaks might be due to the same alpha proton in the same molecule, but in different environments due to some exchange process. Like if the molecule is interconverting between two forms rapidly on the NMR timescale, leading to two peaks. But that's called a "splitting" due to exchange, but I don't think that's common. Or perhaps it's a case of a double bond and coupling, but again, ruled out.

Wait, perhaps the alpha proton is adjacent to a chiral center with two different coupling partners. Like, if it's coupling with two different sets of protons, but the question states spin-spin coupling is ruled out.

Alternatively, maybe the two peaks are due to the same proton being in two different environments in the same molecule because of some diastereotopicity. But I'm not sure how that would split the peak.

I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should go back and think about the options again.

The correct answer is probably D, diastereomers.

Because the LC-MS shows two peaks of same mass (so same molecular formula, which fits diastereomers) and the NMR shows two peaks for the same alpha proton. Each diastereomer's alpha proton would have a slightly different shift, leading to two peaks with similar shifts. So if the shifts are very close, it can appear as two peaks. The integrals add to 1H because each diastereomer contributes 0.5H? No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe it's a case of a single diastereomer with two protons, but that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps the two diastereomers each contribute a peak for the same alpha-proton, but since the shifts are very similar, the two peaks are close together but still separate. So the integral would be 1H in total for both peaks because each molecule has one alpha-proton, and if each contributes 1H, but in a 1:1 ratio, the total would be 2H. But the question says it's 1H. So that doesn't fit. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the problem is about the integration. Perhaps each peak is only 0.5H, so together 1H. That would imply that each diastereomer has only 0.5H, which is impossible because each molecule must have an integer number of protons.

Wait, but maybe the diastereomers are in a 1:1 ratio, and the integration for each is 0.5H. No, that can't be because each molecule would have one alpha-proton. So if you have 1 mole of each diastereomer, each contributes 1 mole of alpha-proton, so the integral would be 2H.

But the question says the integration is 1H. So that can't be.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the two diastereomers each have two alpha-protons, but that's not applicable because the question refers to the same alpha-proton.

Alternatively, perhaps the two peaks are due to a vicinal coupling with another proton, but the question rules that out.

At this point, I'm a bit stuck, but considering all the options, the most plausible answer is D: mixture of diastereoisomers. Because it explains the LC-MS (same mass) and the NMR (two peaks for same alpha-proton, each from a diastereomer with similar shifts). But the integral doesn't match. Unless I'm misunderstanding the integral.

Wait, the question says the integral is roughly equal, together 1H. So each is about 0.5H. Which doesn't make sense for a 1:1 mixture of diastereomers with each having one alpha-proton. So perhaps the correct answer isn't D.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is B: enantiomers. But then the NMR should be a single peak, not two.

Wait, another angle: the NMR is for the crude compound, which is a racemic mixture. But during the analysis, the sample is exposed to some chiral environment, causing the two enantiomers to separate. But in the NMR, the two enantiomers would still cause the same peak, as the environment isn't chiral in NMR. Unless the NMR is run in a chiral solvent or something, but that's not mentioned.

Wait, perhaps the problem is about the synthesis. If during the amide bond formation, the reaction forms two diastereomers, for example, because of the way the substituents are arranged. So the final product is a mixture of diastereomers. Then, the NMR would show two peaks for the same alpha-proton, each from a different diastereomer. And the LC-MS would show two peaks because the diastereomers have same mass but different structures.

But then the integrals add to 1H. So perhaps each diastereomer has only 0.5H of that alpha-proton. Which doesn't make sense. So maybe the correct answer is D.

Wait, perhaps the way the molecule is structured, the alpha-protons are split into two due to some other effect, but the question rules that out.

Alternatively, perhaps the two peaks are from the same diastereomer, but in different conformations. But again, that doesn't explain the integral.

I think I'm going around in circles. Based on the options, the correct answer is D: mixture of diastereoisomers.


The question involves analyzing a small peptidic compound where the 1H NMR spectrum shows two peaks corresponding to the same alpha-proton, with similar chemical shifts, roughly equal integrals (summing to 1H), and no evidence of spin-spin coupling. The LC-MS analysis reveals two peaks of equal intensity with the same mass, consistent with the expected molecule. The goal is to determine the most likely explanation for these observations.

### Key Analysis of the Options:

1. **Option A: Contaminated with a precursor**  
   A precursor would likely have a different molecular weight, leading to a distinct mass in the LC-MS spectrum. Since the question specifies that the mass is consistent with the expected molecule, this option is unlikely.

2. **Option B: Mixture of enantiomers**  
   Enantiomers have the same molecular weight and identical NMR chemical shifts due to their symmetry. If the sample were a racemic mixture, the NMR would show a single peak for the alpha-proton, not two peaks. Therefore, this option does not explain the observations.

3. **Option C: 'Double coupling' during an amide-bond forming reaction**  
   The question explicitly rules out spin-spin coupling as an explanation for the duplicate peaks. Additionally, "double coupling" would not typically result in two distinct peaks with similar chemical shifts for the same alpha-proton. This makes this option implausible.

4. **Option D: Mixture of diastereoisomers**  
   Diastereoisomers have the same molecular weight, explaining the identical mass in the LC-MS spectrum. They can also have different chemical environments for certain protons, leading to distinct NMR peaks for the same proton in each diastereomer. The two peaks in the NMR spectrum could arise from the alpha-proton in each diastereomer having slightly different chemical environments, resulting in similar but separate peaks. The LC-MS showing two peaks of equal intensity further supports this explanation, as diastereoisomers would separate on the column due to their structural differences.

### Conclusion:
The most likely explanation is that the crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers. This accounts for the identical mass in LC-MS, the two distinct NMR peaks for the same alpha-proton, and the roughly equal integrals of the peaks.

**Answer: D**
