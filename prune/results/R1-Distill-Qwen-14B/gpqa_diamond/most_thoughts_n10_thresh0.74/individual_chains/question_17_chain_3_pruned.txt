Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to find the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, let me think about what I know. The problem says it's a stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Stochiometric I think means it's in a 1:1 ratio, so the formula would be CaY²-, right? EDTA is the ligand.

The concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M. So that would be the concentration of [CaY²-]. They also give the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, which is 5x10^10. Oh wait, formation constant is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. So the reaction is Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA²-.

I remember that the formation constant Kf is equal to [CaEDTA²-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]). So if I can find the concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA^4- from this, but wait, the problem is asking for the concentration of calcium ions in solution. 

But wait, how much of the Ca is dissociated? Since Kf is so large (5e10), that suggests the complex is very stable. So most of the Ca should be in the complex form, and very little free Ca²+.

Wait, the complex is 0.02 M, so [CaEDTA²-] is 0.02 M. Let me think about the dissociation. Let's denote the concentration of free Ca²+ as x. Since EDTA is in excess maybe? Or is it in stoichiometric amounts?

Wait, when you have a solution of the Ca-EDTA complex, it dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-. So the dissociation reaction is: CaEDTA²- ↔ Ca²+ + EDTA^4-.

The K for this dissociation would be 1/Kf, because Kf is formation, so dissociation is reverse. So Kd = 1/(5e10) = 2e-11.

So the equilibrium expression is Kd = [Ca²+][EDTA^4-]/[CaEDTA²-].

Assuming that the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, and the dissociation is x, so [Ca²+] = x, [EDTA^4-
