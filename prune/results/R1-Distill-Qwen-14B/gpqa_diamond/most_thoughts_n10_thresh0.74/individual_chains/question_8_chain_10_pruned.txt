Okay, so I've got this genetics problem here about plant resistance to a fungal disease. Let me try to break it down step by step.

Alright, the setup: they're working with white lupine and anthracnose, which is a fungal disease. They did a high-throughput experiment and found three candidate genes, G1, G2, and G3. They made knock-out mutants for each and some double mutants too. The goal is to figure out how these genes interact, especially since at least one is a transcription factor upstream of others.

The experiment's results show the resistance levels of each mutant and their combinations. The control (wild-type) has 100% resistance, which I assume means they don't get infected. Lower percentages mean more susceptibility—so 0% is completely susceptible, all infected.

Let me list the data:

- G1 knockout: 75% resistance. So less resistant than wild-type, but not completely susceptible.
- G2 knockout: 0% resistance. So these plants are super susceptible, can't resist the fungus at all.
- G3 knockout: 50% resistance. So they're halfway as resistant as the wild type.
- G1G3 double mutant: 10% resistance. Very low, almost like G2.
- G2G3 double mutant: 0% again. Same as G2 alone.
- G1G2 double mutant: 0% resistance again.

Hmm. So what does this tell us about the gene interactions?

First, knowing that at least one is a transcription factor. Transcription factors usually act upstream, regulating the expression of other genes. So if a TF is knocked out, the downstream genes it regulates wouldn't be expressed, which could affect resistance.

Looking at the single mutants: G2 has 0% resistance. That's a big hit. So G2 knockout plants are completely susceptible. G1 and G3 have partial resistance.

Now, the double mutants. Let's see:

G1G2: 0%. So knocking out both G1 and G2 leads to no resistance. But wait, when only G2 is knocked out, the resistance is already 0. So knocking out G1 along with G2 doesn't make it worse—stays at 0. Maybe G1 is downstream of G2, or G2 is upstream.

G1G3: 10%. So both knocked out leads to very low resistance. Hmm. So their combined effect is worse than either alone. G1 alone is 75%, G3 alone 50%, but together it's 10%—so it's more than additive.

G2G3: 0%. Again, same as G2 alone. So adding G3 knockout doesn't change the fact that G2 is already making them susceptible.

So, what can we infer from this? Let's think about gene hierarchy. If a gene is epistatic, its mutation masks the effect of another gene. So if G2 is epistatic, then its mutation would hide the effect of G1 or G3.

But wait, the G2 single mutant is 0%, which is the same as the G2G3 double mutant. So perhaps G2 is upstream of G3. Because if G2 is a transcription factor and regulates G3, then knocking out G2 would prevent G3 from being expressed. But wait, in the single G3 mutant, the resistance is 50%. So if G3 were regulated by G2, then G2 knockout would lead to G3 not being expressed, which would perhaps lead to lower resistance than G3's 50% alone. But wait, in the G2 knockout, resistance is 0%, which is worse than G3's 50%. So maybe G2 is upstream of G3, but perhaps G3 isn't the only downstream gene.

Wait, another angle: when you have epistatic relationships, it's about which gene is
