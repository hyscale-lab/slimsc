Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let's see what it's about. The question is about measuring two observables, P and Q, in sequence, and finding the probability of getting specific outcomes. I remember that observables correspond to Hermitian operators, and their eigenvalues are the possible measurement outcomes.

The state vector is given as (-1, 2, 1). Wait, is that a column vector? Yeah, the problem says it's a column matrix. So it's a 3-dimensional vector, which makes sense because the operators are 3x3 matrices.

First, I think I need to normalize the state vector because the probabilities must sum to 1. Let me calculate the norm. The norm squared is (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 +4 +1 = 6. So the norm is sqrt(6). Therefore, the state vector is ( -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) )^T.

Next, the operator P has a matrix with elements as given. Let me write it out. The first row is [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0], second row [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)], third row [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]. Let me check if this is a Hermitian matrix because P is an observable. Since all the elements are real and symmetric across the diagonal, it should be Hermitian.

To find the possible outcomes of P, I need to find the eigenvalues of P. But wait, perhaps it's easier to see what the matrix represents. Alternatively, maybe I can diagonalize it. Alternatively, another approach is to compute the expectation value, but I'm not sure if that's needed here.

Wait, the question is about the probability of getting 0 for P. Hmm, maybe I should find the eigenvectors corresponding to the eigenvalue 0 of P. Because when you measure P, the outcome is an eigenvalue, and the probability is the square of the amplitude of the component in that eigenvector.

So, let's find the eigenvalues of P. The matrix P is:

Row 1: [0, 1/√2, 0]

Row 2: [1/√2, 0, 1/√2]

Row 3: [0, 1/√2, 0]

I can try to compute its eigenvalues by solving the characteristic equation det(P - λI) = 0.

But maybe it's easier to see if the matrix has any symmetry or known structure. Alternatively, perhaps P has eigenvalues 1 and -1, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a permutation matrix or something similar.

Wait, another approach: perhaps P is a spin operator or something similar. Alternatively, maybe I can find its eigenvalues by considering that it's a 3x3 matrix.

Alternatively, let me consider that P might be a tensor product or some combination. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the eigenvectors for eigenvalue 0. Let's suppose that P |v> = 0 |v>.

So, we can write the equations:

(0 - λ) for λ=0: P |v> = 0.

So,

Row 1: 0*v1 + (1/√2) v2 + 0*v3 = 0 → v2 = 0.

Row 2: (1/√2) v1 + 0*v2 + (1/√2) v3 = 0 → v1 + v3 = 0.

Row 3: 0*v1 + (1/√2) v2 + 0*v3 = 0 → v2=0.

From row 1 and 3, v2 = 0. Then from row 2, v1 = -v3.

So the eigenvectors for P=0 are vectors where v2=0 and v1 = -v3. So, let's take v3 = a, then v1 = -a, and v2=0. So the eigenvectors are proportional to (-1, 0, 1) or any multiple.

Wait, that's a possible eigenvector.

So, the eigenspace for P=0 is one-dimensional, right? Because we have two parameters (a and any other?), but perhaps not. Let me see.

Wait, the equations are v2=0 and v1 = -v3. So the eigenvectors are of the form ( -a, 0, a ), which can be written as a*( -1, 0, 1 ). So the eigenspace is one-dimensional. Therefore, the eigenvalue 0 has multiplicity one.

So the eigenvector for P=0 is proportional to ( -1, 0, 1 ). Let me normalize it. The length is sqrt( (-1)^2 + 0 + 1^2 ) = sqrt(2). So the normalized eigenvector is ( -1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2) )^T.

Wait, but wait: when I solved P |v> = 0, I found that v2=0 and v1 = -v3. So yeah, that seems correct.

So the eigenvector is |0> = ( -1, 0, 1 )^T / sqrt(2). So any state expressed in terms of |0> will have P=0.

Now, the initial state is |ψ> = ( -1, 2, 1 )^T / sqrt(6).

We need the probability that measuring P gives 0. That's the square of the inner product between |ψ> and |0>.

Wait, the inner product is |ψ>† |0>.

So, let's compute it.

|0> is ( -1, 0, 1 ) / sqrt(2), so the inner product is [ (-1)/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) ] · [ (-1)/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2) ].

Which is [ ( (-1)*(-1) ) / (sqrt(6)*sqrt(2)) ) + (2*0)/(sqrt(6)*sqrt(2)) + (1*1)/(sqrt(6)*sqrt(2)) ) ]

= [ (1 )/(sqrt(12)) + 0 + (1)/(sqrt(12)) ]

= 2/(sqrt(12)) = 2/(2*sqrt(3)) )= 1/sqrt(3).

So the amplitude is 1/sqrt(3), so the probability is (1/sqrt(3))² = 1/3.

Wait, so the probability of getting 0 for P is 1/3.

But wait, the question is about measuring P and then Q, and getting 0 for P and -1 for Q.

But wait, first, after measuring P and getting 0, the state collapses to the eigenvector of P corresponding to 0. So the new state is |0> = ( -1, 0, 1 ) / sqrt(2).

Then, we measure Q in this new state.

So we need to find the probability of getting -1 for Q in this state.

The operator Q has matrix:

Row 1: [1, 0, 0]

Row 2: [0, 0, 0]

Row 3: [0, 0, -1]

So Q is a diagonal matrix with eigenvalues 1, 0, -1.

So the eigenvalues are 1, 0, -1.

The eigenvectors are the standard basis vectors. So for eigenvalue -1, the eigenvector is |q=-1> = (0, 0, 1)^T. Because when Q acts on (0, 0, 1), it gives -1*(0,0,1).

So the state after P measurement is |0> = (-1, 0, 1)/sqrt(2).

We need the probability of measuring Q = -1 in this state.

That's the square of the inner product between |0> and |q=-1>.

The inner product is [ (-1)/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2) ] · [0, 0, 1]^T.

Which is ( (-1)(0) ) + (0)(0) + (1/sqrt(2))(1) ) = 1/sqrt(2).

So the amplitude is 1/sqrt(2), so the probability is (1/sqrt(2))² = 1/2.

Wait, wait. So the probability of getting P=0 is 1/3, and after that, the probability of Q=-1 is 1/2. So the joint probability is (1/3) * (1/2 )= 1/6.

But wait, no, because after measuring P=0, the state is |0>, so the probability of Q=-1 is 1/2 in that state. So the total probability is 1/3 (P=0) multiplied by 1/2 (Q=-1 given P=0), which is 1/6.

Wait, but the options have D) 1/6 as an option. So the answer would be D.

Wait, but wait. Let me go back. Did I compute the correct probabilities?

The initial state is |ψ> = ( -1, 2, 1 ) / sqrt(6).

The probability of P=0 is | <0|ψ> |² = (1/sqrt(3))^2 = 1/3. Correct.

Then, |0> is the state after measurement. Now, in this state, Q is measured. The probability for Q=-1 is | <q=-1 |0> |², which is (1/sqrt(2))^2 = 1/2. So the joint probability is 1/3 * 1/2 = 1/6.

So the correct answer is D) 1/6.


To solve the problem, we analyze the sequence of measurements and compute the probabilities step by step.

### Step 1: Normalize the initial state
The given state vector is \( |\psi\rangle = (-1, 2, 1)^T \). Its norm is calculated as:
\[
\| |\psi\rangle \|^2 = (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6.
\]
Thus, the normalized state is:
\[
|\psi\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}}(-1, 2, 1)^T.
\]

### Step 2: Find the probability of measuring \( P = 0 \)
The operator \( P \) is given by:
\[
P = \begin{pmatrix}
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0
\end{pmatrix}.
\]
To find the eigenvalue \( P = 0 \), we solve \( P |v\rangle = 0 \). The eigenvector corresponding to \( P = 0 \) is proportional to \( (-1, 0, 1)^T \). Normalizing this eigenvector gives:
\[
|0\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(-1, 0, 1)^T.
\]
The probability of measuring \( P = 0 \) is the square of the overlap between \( |\psi\rangle \) and \( |0\rangle \):
\[
P(P=0) = |\langle 0 | \psi \rangle|^2 = \left| \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(-1, 0, 1) \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}}(-1, 2, 1) \right|^2.
\]
Calculating the inner product:
\[
\langle 0 | \psi \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \left[ (-1)(-1) + 0(2) + 1(1) \right] = \frac{1}{\sqrt{12}} (1 + 0 + 1) = \frac{2}{\sqrt{12}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}.
\]
Thus:
\[
P(P=0) = \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} \right)^2 = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

### Step 3: State after \( P = 0 \) measurement
If \( P = 0 \) is measured, the state collapses to \( |0\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(-1, 0, 1)^T \).

### Step 4: Measure \( Q = -1 \) in the new state
The operator \( Q \) is given by:
\[
Q = \begin{pmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & -1
\end{pmatrix}.
\]
The eigenvalue \( Q = -1 \) corresponds to the eigenvector \( |q=-1\rangle = (0, 0, 1)^T \). The probability of measuring \( Q = -1 \) in the state \( |0\rangle \) is the square of the overlap:
\[
P(Q=-1 | P=0) = |\langle q=-1 | 0 \rangle|^2 = \left| \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(-1, 0, 1) \cdot (0, 0, 1) \right|^2.
\]
Calculating the inner product:
\[
\langle q=-1 | 0 \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot 1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]
Thus:
\[
P(Q=-1 | P=0) = \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right)^2 = \frac{1}{2}.
\]

### Step 5: Joint probability
The joint probability of measuring \( P = 0 \) and \( Q = -1 \) is:
\[
P(P=0, Q=-1) = P(P=0) \cdot P(Q=-1 | P=0) = \frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{6}.
\]

### Final Answer
The probability of measuring \( P = 0 \) and \( Q = -1 \) is \( \frac{1}{6} \).
