Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me break it down.

The question has two parts: reaction 1 and reaction 2, each producing products A and B respectively. The options give possible combinations of A and B, so I need to determine each part separately.

First, let's look at reaction 1: 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol is reacting with THF, KH, and H+ to give product A. I remember that KH (Potassium hydride) is a strong base, often used as a deprotonating agent. THF is a common solvent, so probably not involved in the reaction itself.

The starting material is a spiro compound. Spiro compounds have two rings connected by a single atom. The structure might look like a bicyclic system. The formula is 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol. Let me draw this structure. So, the spiro is between a three-membered ring and a five-membered ring? Wait, spiro[3.5]non... The 'non' suggests a nine-carbon system. Hmm, maybe it's a bridge or a fused ring. Alternatively, it's a spiro system where two rings share one carbon. The first part is a three-membered ring, the second a five-membered ring.

The substituents are a vinyl group (CH2=CH-) and a hydroxyl group. Wait, the formula is 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol. So the first ring (3 membered) has the vinyl group at position 1 and the hydroxyl group at position 1 as well. That doesn't make sense since a three-membered ring can't have two substituents on the same carbon unless it's a bridge. Maybe the structure is such that the spiro carbon is position 1, with a vinyl group and a hydroxyl group attached.

When this reacts with a strong base like KH, maybe it's getting deprotonated. Wait, where's an acidic proton? The hydroxyl group is an alcohol, so in a basic medium, it would deprotonate to form an alkoxide. But in THF, which is a polar aprotic solvent, and with a strong base like KH, perhaps it's more about elimination or some kind of cyclization.

Wait, but maybe it's an E2 elimination. The base abstracts a proton, leading to the formation of a double bond. Alternatively, in such a setup, maybe an enol ether is formed or some kind of ring-closing. Alternatively, the reaction could involve some kind of conjugate addition or elimination.

Wait, the starting material is an allylic alcohol. Because it's a spiro compound with a vinyl group and an enol (since the -OH is on the same carbon as a double bond). So maybe the reaction is a conjugate elimination. When an allylic alcohol is treated with a strong base, it can undergo elimination to form a cyclic ether or a larger ring via cyclization. Wait, but in this case, the base is KH, which is a strong, non-nucleophilic base. It might abstract a proton, leading to
