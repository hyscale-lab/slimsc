Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem has two parts, A and B, each involving a different reaction. I need to figure out the major products for both and select the correct option from the choices given.

Starting with part A: The starting material is ((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene. That's a bit of a mouthful. Let me try to visualize it. Benzene ring with a substituent. The substituent is an oxy group (O) attached to a methyl group. Wait, no, the substituent is (3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy methyl. Hmm. Let me break that down.

The substituent is an ether: the structure is OCH2- attached to a but-2-en-1-yl group which is substituted with a methyl at position 3. So, but-2-en-1-yl is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond between C2 and C3. So it's CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-O-CH2-Ph? Wait, no. Wait, the substituent is ((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl. So it's O-CH2-Ph connected to the butenyl group.

Wait, but but-2-en-1-yl would be CH2=CHCH2CH2-? No, butyl is four carbons. But but-2-en-1-yl is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with double bond at 2. Wait, no. But-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2CH2-? No, wait, the numbering starts at the first carbon of the substituent. So but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2CH2- but attached at the first carbon. Hmm, maybe it's better to draw it:

But-2-en-1-yl group: structure is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2- with a double bond between C2 and C3. So it's CH2=CHCH2CH2- but attached from the first carbon. So the substituent is OCH2-C6H5 (the benzene) attached to the butenyl group.

Wait, perhaps the structure is more like:

Ph-O-CH2-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-? No, wait, the substituent is (3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy methyl. So the oxy is between the butenyl and the methyl, which is attached to the benzene.

Wait, perhaps it's:

Ph-O-CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-? No, but it's but-2-en-1-yl, so the double bond is between C2 and C3. So the substituent is OCH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- but with a double bond between the first and second carbon of the substituent? No, wait. Let me think.

But-
