Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it my best shot.

The question says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I remember that red phosphorus and HI are used for the hydrolysis of an acid chloride. Oh wait, right! When an acid chloride (like RCOCl) reacts with HI, it typically hydrolyzes to form an acid (RCOOH) and release HCl, which is then neutralized by the phosphorus. So that reaction is RCOCl + HI → RCOOH + HCl, and the phosphorus probably just mops up the HCl.

So, the first thing I need to do is figure out what Compound X is. Because knowing its structure will help me determine what the product is after the reaction.

The problem gives the IR and NMR data for Compound X. Let's look at the IR first.

IR data:
- 3400–2500 cm⁻¹: This broad region suggests the presence of either an -OH group (like in an alcohol or carboxylic acid) or an NH stretch. But looking at the options, I don't see any amines, so maybe an -OH. But wait, in the reaction, it's reacting with HI and phosphorus, which suggests it's an acid chloride. Oh wait, no, because if it's an acid chloride, the IR would show a strong peak around 1800 cm⁻¹. Let me think again.

Wait, the IR has a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹. That's a strong peak, typically for a carbonyl group. An acid chloride has a peak around 1800, an ester around 1740, maybe a ketone around 1715. Hmm, but 1720 could fit an ester or maybe a ketone. Alternatively, maybe it's an aldehyde, but the 1720 is a bit high for that. Let me think.

Wait, another peak at 1610 and 1450 cm⁻¹. Those are around the ranges for aromatic C=C stretching. So the compound has an aromatic ring, probably with some substitution.

So putting this together, the compound has a carbonyl group and an aromatic ring.

Looking at the NMR data.

1H NMR:
- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): A broad singlet around 10.5. That's a strong indicator of an -OH proton, like in a carboxylic acid. Wait, but if the compound is an acid chloride
