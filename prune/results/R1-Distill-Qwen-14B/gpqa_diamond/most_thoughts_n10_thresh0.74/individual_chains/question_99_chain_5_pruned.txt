Okay, I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let me read the question carefully and think through each step.

So, the question is about identifying an unknown compound using FTIR and 1H NMR data. There are four options, all seem to be carboxylic acids based on the COOH group in their structures.

First, let's look at the FTIR data. The problem states that there's a very broad absorption around 3000 cm⁻¹. That broad peak usually indicates O-H stretching, which is present in carboxylic acids. Carboxylic acids have a strong O-H stretch around 2500-3300 cm⁻¹, and it's usually broad because of hydrogen bonding.

Then, there's a strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹. That's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch, which makes sense because carboxylic acids have a carbonyl group. So the FTIR data fits a carboxylic acid, which aligns with all the options provided.

Now, looking at the 1H NMR data. The problem says that none of the signals correspond to vinyl hydrogens. So the molecule doesn't have any double bonds with adjacent hydrogens. That rules out any possibility of a compound with a vinyl group, but looking at the options, all of them are branched, so probably no vinyl groups anyway.

The NMR also has a signal that's a doublet of triplets of quartets and another that's a doublet of triplets of triplets. Hmm, that's a bit tricky. I remember that splitting patterns in NMR arise from neighboring hydrogens. Each neighboring set of equivalent hydrogens will split the signal into a number of peaks equal to the number of neighboring H's plus one.

Let me analyze each option's structure and see how the protons might split.

Option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH

So this structure is a pentanoic acid derivative. The main chain would be CH2-COOH, but the central part is a C connected to another C with substituents. Let me draw it out.

Let me see: The structure is:

CH3-C(H)(C2H5) - C(H)(C2H5) - CH2 - COOH

Wait, no, that can't be right. Let's see: the formula would be more like:

CH3-C(CH2CH3)(H) - C(CH2CH3)(H) - CH2COOH

So the central part is two CH groups, each attached to two ethyl groups. So each of those CH groups is attached to two ethyl groups and a CH2CH2COOH group.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

CH3-C(CH3)(C2H5)CH2-COOH ?

Wait, maybe I should write each option more clearly.

Option A: CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2-COOH

So, the molecule is:

(CH3)(C2H5)CH-CH(CH2CH3)CH2COOH?

Wait, perhaps each CH is connected to two ethyl groups and another CH group. Wait, maybe the structure is:

The molecule is: CH3-CH2-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-COOH

Wait, no, the formula given is CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH.

So the structure is:

CH3 - C(H)(C2H5) - C(H)(C2H5) - CH2COOH

Wait, that would be:

CH3-CH(CH2CH3)-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-COOH

Wait, no, because C(H)(C2H5) means a carbon attached to one H, one C2H5 (ethyl), and two more substituents? Or wait, maybe each C(H)(C2H5) is
