Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of formation of a specific organic compound. Hmm, the compound is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. That looks a bit complex, but I think I can break it down.

Wait, the question gives me the enthalpy of atomization for carbon as 1000 kJ/mol. Oh right, atomization is breaking a molecule into individual atoms. So for carbon, that's the energy needed to turn C(s) into C(g), I guess. 

The other given data are bond energies. Bond energies are the energies required to break a bond. So, H-H is 100 kJ/mol, C-C is 200, C=C is 300, and C-H is 400. 

But wait, the problem is about the enthalpy of formation. Enthalpy of formation is the change when a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. The formula I remember is: 

ΔHf° = (sum of bond energies of reactants) - (sum of bond energies of products) + enthalpy of atomization terms? Or wait, maybe I should think in terms of the formation from elements, so I need to consider the bonds broken and formed in that process.

Alternatively, another approach is that the enthalpy of formation can be calculated using the bond energies of all the bonds in the molecule. So for a molecule, the enthalpy of formation is the sum of the bond energies of all
