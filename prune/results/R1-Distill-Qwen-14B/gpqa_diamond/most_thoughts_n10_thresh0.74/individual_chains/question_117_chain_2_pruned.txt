Alright, so I've got this question about optical isomerism in organic compounds. Hmm, I remember that optical isomerism occurs when a compound has chiral centers, making it able to rotate plane-polarized light. Chiral centers are atoms, usually carbon, bonded to four different groups. But wait, are there other possibilities, like meso compounds or geometric (cis-trans) isomerism?

The question lists four compounds, and I need to determine which of them exhibit optical isomerism. Let's go through each one step by step.

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.
Okay, biphenyl groups connected at positions 1 and 1'. The substituents are nitro groups at 6,6' and carboxylate (OOCR) groups at 2,2'. So let me visualize this. The main structure is a biphenyl with two nitro groups on each phenyl ring at the 6 position and two carboxylate groups at the 2 position. Now, can this compound have stereoisomerism?

Wait, biphenyls can have a lot of substituents. If the substituents are in positions that allow for different arrangements, maybe there's a possibility of geometric isomerism. But wait, the question is about optical isomerism, which is a type of stereoisomerism. So, for optical isomerism, the compound must have a chiral center or a structure that is not superimposable on its mirror image.

But wait, looking at the substituents: each phenyl ring has two nitro groups and two carboxylate groups. Are these substituents arranged in a way that creates a chiral center? Let me see. Alternatively, could the biphenyl itself have a plane of symmetry? If the substituents are symmetric, maybe it's not chiral.

Wait, the positions are 6,6' and 2,2'. So on each phenyl ring, nitro is at 6 and carboxylate at 2. Since biphenyls are connected at 1 and 1', the substituents are at positions that are across from each other on each ring. So each ring would have the nitro and carboxylate groups in the same relative position. Wait, maybe this compound is symmetrical. So the entire molecule might have a plane of symmetry, making it
