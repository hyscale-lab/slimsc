Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a boson. Hmm, let's see what it's all about. The question gives me a Lagrangian for the interaction between a bosonic field X and some fermions. The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV, and I need to figure out what its allowed decays are at the lowest order.

Wait, the Lagrangian is given as L(y) = -λf ψ̄_f (y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my Lagrangians. So this looks like an interaction term. Let me parse it: the term has ψ̄ and ψ, so it's a fermion field. The boson X is multiplied by some constants and part of the term inside. So the interaction is between the boson X and the fermion ψ_f.

But wait, the term is ψ̄_f (y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). So when you expand this, I think it's like ψ̄ X ψ plus ψ̄ υ ψ. But υ is probably a constant, like the vacuum expectation value (VEV), right? So maybe this is the Yukawa interaction, which is a standard model interaction between fermions and the Higgs boson. So in this case, X could be acting like a Higgs boson, since the Higgs couples to fermions via a Yukawa coupling.

In the Standard Model, the Higgs has a mass around 125 GeV, but here X has a mass of 6 GeV. Hmm. So for the decay of X, what particles can it decay into? Well, the boson's mass dictates what fermions it can produce.

So the decay X → f f̄, where f is a fermion. But for this to be kinematically allowed, the mass of X must be at least twice the mass of the fermion. So the maximum possible mass for the fermion pair is M_X / 2 = 3 GeV.

So I need to find all fermions with mass less than or equal to 3 GeV. Let's think about the known fermions. The charged leptons are electrons (mass ~0.5 MeV), muons (~105 MeV), taus (~1.78 GeV). The quarks are up (light, ~2 MeV), down (similar), strange (~100 MeV), and charm (~1.5 GeV). Bottom quarks are around 4.5 GeV, which is more than 3 GeV, so X can't decay into b quarks because 2*4.5 is 9 GeV which is more than 6 GeV. Similarly, top quarks are way heavier, so no decay into t t̄.

So which fermions are allowed? Let's list them:

- Leptons: e, mu, tau. Tau is about 1.78 GeV, so 2m_tau ~3.56 GeV. Hmm, wait X is 6 GeV. So 3.56 GeV is less than 6 GeV, so tau can be produced. Wait, wait, wait. Because the maximum allowed mass for the fermion pair is 3 GeV each, because 6 GeV/2 is 3 GeV. So wait, the tau is about 1.78 GeV, so 2m_tau is 3.56 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV. Wait no, wait, wait. Wait, the mass of X is 6 GeV, so the maximum energy each fermion can have is 3 GeV. So any fermion with mass less than or equal to 3 GeV can be produced. So tau has a mass of about 1.78 GeV, which is less than 3 GeV. So X can decay into tau pairs. Similarly, muons and electrons are way below.

But wait, wait: the allowed decay is when m_X >= 2 m_f. Because each fermion needs to have at least m_f each, so 2m_f ≤ m_X. So for tau, 2*1.78 ≈3.56 GeV. Since X is 6 GeV, that's allowed. So X can decay into tau+ tau-.

What about quarks? Let's see:

- Up quark: m_u ≈ 2 MeV. So 2m_u is negligible. So X can decay into u ū.

- Down quark: same, m_d ~5 MeV, so 2m_d ~10 MeV. So allowed.

- Strange quark: m_s ~100 MeV. 2m_s ~200 MeV. So X can decay into s s̄.

- Charm quark: m_c ~1.5 GeV. 2m_c ~3 GeV, which is exactly m_X /2. So 3 GeV is allowed, so X can decay into c c̄.

Wait, but what about bottom quark? m_b ~4.5 GeV. 2m_b is 9 GeV, which is greater than m_X=6 GeV. So X can't decay into b b̄.

So the allowed fermions are: e, μ, tau, u, d, s, c.

Wait, but in the Lagrangian, what is the fermion content? The Lagrangian term is for ψ_f. So what fermions are present? The problem says it's fermions, but doesn't specify which. So we have to assume that all possible fermions are present for
