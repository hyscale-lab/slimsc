Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and honestly, I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question carefully again.

The state of the system at time t is given by the column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, wait, that doesn't look like a unit vector. Oh wait, maybe it's normalized? Let me check. The vector is [-1, 2, 1]^T. To find its magnitude, I square each component: (-1)^2 is 1, 2^2 is 4, 1^2 is 1. Adding them up gives 1 +4 +1 =6. So the magnitude is sqrt(6). So the state vector is (1/sqrt(6))*[-1, 2, 1]^T. Oh, right, because in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are unit vectors, so the original vector is not normalized, and we have to normalize it.

Wait, the question says it's a column matrix with elements (-1,2,1). So the state vector is |Ïˆ> = (-1, 2, 1)^T / sqrt(6). Because the norm is sqrt(6), so divide each component by sqrt(6) to make it a unit vector.

Then, the operators P and Q are given as square matrices. Let me write them down.

Operator P's matrix is:

First row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0

Second row: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)

Third row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0

And operator Q's matrix is diagonal:

First row: 1,0,0

Second row:0,0,0

Third row:0,0,-1

So, Q is a diagonal matrix with eigenvalues 1, 0, -1. That makes sense because the diagonal entries are the eigenvalues, assuming it's a diagonal matrix.

The question is: if someone measures Q just after the measurement of P, what is the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q in the respective measurements?

Wait, no. Wait, the measurement order is: first measure P
