Okay, so I've got this cycloaddition reaction problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about a [4+2] cycloaddition between 2,5-dimethylthiophene and furan-2,5-dione under heat. I need to find the exo product from the given options.

Hmm, first, I remember that [4+2] cycloadditions are Diels-Alder reactions. Oh wait, but wait, Diels-Alder typically involves a diene and a dienophile. So what's the diene and what's the dienophile here? Let me think about the structures.

2,5-dimethylthiophene has two methyl groups at positions 2 and 5. Thiophene is a five-membered ring with one sulfur. Furan-2,5-dione, on the other hand, is a furan (five-membered ring with oxygen) with ketone groups at positions 2 and 5. So, the structure is like O=C1C=CC(=O)1, I think.

Wait, so in Diels-Alder, the diene is conjugated and usually in s-cis conformation. The dienophile is something like a double bond that's electron-deficient, like a ketone. Oh wait, waitâ€”furan-2,5-dione... that's a dienophile? Or is the thiophene acting as the diene?

Wait, thiophene is an aromatic ring. I think when thiophene is involved in Diels-Alder, it probably isn't the diene. Because thiophene is aromatic, it's not a conjugated diene. Wait, but wait, maybe the furan is acting as the dienophile here? Or maybe the other way around.

Wait, another thought: the dienophile should have a good electron-deficient double bond. Furan-2,5-dione has two ketone groups adjacent to the double bonds. So the double bonds in furan-2,5-dione might be activated as dienophiles because of the electron-withdrawing ketones. So maybe furan-2,5-dione is the dienophile here.

Then the diene would be 2,5-dimethylthiophene. But wait, thiophene is an aromatic ring with a five-membered structure;
