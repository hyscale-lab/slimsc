Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here. It involves some sigmatropic rearrangements, which I'm a bit fuzzy on, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question has three parts, A, B, and C, each from a different reaction. I need to figure out the products for each and then match them with the options provided. Let's take each reaction one by one.

Starting with reaction 1: 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine reacting with but-3-en-2-ol under H+ and heat. Hmm, I remember that when there's H+ and heat, especially with ethers and amines, it might be a Claisen or Cope rearrangement. Wait, but wait, Claisen is for allyl vinyl ethers, right? The starting material has an amine, not an ether. Oh, but maybe it's a similar rearrangement.

Wait, the first reactant is 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine. Let me draw that structure. So, it's ethan-1-amine where the amine is attached to two methoxy groups and one methyl group perhaps? Wait, no: 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine would be (CH3O)2CH-NH2. Oh wait, wait, ethan-1-amine is CH3CH2NH2, but with two methoxy groups on the same carbon, so structure is HOCH2N(CH3O)2? No, wait, that's not right. Wait, ethan-1-amine is CH3CH2NH2. So 1,1-dimethoxy would mean both substituents on the same carbon as the NH2. So, structure is (CH2OCH3)2NH. Wait, but that's not possible because it's ethan-1-amine, so the amine is on the first carbon. So the structure is CH2(N(CH3O)2)CH3? No, wait, maybe it's (CH3O)2CHCH2NH2? Wait, no, wait, ethan-1-amine is H2NCH2CH3. So 1,1-dimethoxy would have two OMe groups on the same carbon as the amine. So structure: (CH3O
