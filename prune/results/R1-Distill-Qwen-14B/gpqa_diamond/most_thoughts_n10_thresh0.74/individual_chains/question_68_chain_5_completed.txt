Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a spin-1/2 particle and its magnetic moment. Hmm, let me think through this step by step. I remember that spin-1/2 particles have their spin angular momentum in units of ħ/2. The magnetic moment mu is given by gamma multiplied by Sz, where Sz is the spin component in the z-direction. 

So the initial setup: the magnetic field is along the +Z direction. The particle's magnetic moment is aligned with this field. Then suddenly, the magnetic field is turned off and another one is turned on along the +Y direction. Both fields have the same magnitude, B. The question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment after this change.

Wait, so initially, when the field is along Z, the particle's spin is quantized along Z. The energy levels are determined by the magnetic field. But when the field is switched to Y, the direction of the magnetic field changes, which probably affects the Hamiltonian of the system.

The key here is probably about the time evolution of the spin state when the magnetic field direction changes. When the field was along Z, the Hamiltonian was proportional to Sz. After the switch, it's along Y, so the Hamiltonian becomes proportional to Sy.

I think the spin state before the field change is an eigenstate of Sz. Let's say the initial state is |+z>, which is spin up along Z. After the field changes to Y, the Hamiltonian becomes H = -γ B Sy. Wait, wait, isn't the magnetic moment mu = γ S, so the energy is -mu·B. So for a field in Y, the energy is -γ B Sy.

But the initial state is |+z>, which is an eigenstate of Sz, but not of Sy. So when the field changes, the state is no longer an eigenstate of the new Hamiltonian. Therefore, the spin state will evolve in time, leading to oscillations in expectation values.

The average z-component of the magnetic moment, <mu_z>, will oscillate over time. The frequency of these oscillations is what we're after.

I recall that for a two-level system, the oscillation frequency is determined by the energy difference between the states. When the system is subjected to a Hamiltonian with eigenstates |+> and |->, the energy levels are E+ and E-, and the transition frequency is (E+ - E-)/ħ. Wait, but the units here are a bit tricky. Let me think about the Hamiltonian.

Alternatively, in the case where the particle is in a state that's a superposition of the eigenstates of the new Hamiltonian, the state will evolve with phases determined by the energy difference. The expectation values of observables will oscillate with frequencies related to the energy splitting.

So let's model this. The initial state is |+z>. After the field change, the Hamiltonian is H = γ B Sy (I think, but wait, the exact form may depend on whether the energy is -mu·B or something else. Let me clarify: magnetic moment mu is given as gamma S, so the magnetic energy is -mu·B. Therefore, H = - mu · B = -gamma B S · B_hat. Since B is along Y, H = -gamma B Sy.

Wait, so H is proportional to Sy. So the eigenstates of H are the eigenstates of Sy, which are |+y> and |−y>, where |+y> is eigenstate with Sy = +ħ/2 (since spin-1/2 has eigenvalues ± ħ/2 for Sy).

So the initial state is |+z>, which can be expressed as a linear combination of |+y> and |−y>. Because |+z> is not aligned with the new Hamiltonian's eigenstates.

Let me write |+z> in terms of |+y> and |−y>. I remember the spin states can be expressed in different bases. The |+y> states are combinations of |+z> and |−z>. Specifically, I think:

|+y> = (|+z> + |−z>)/√2
|−y> = (|+z> − |−z>)/√2

So taking the inverse, |+z> can be written as (|+y> + |−y>)/√2.

So the initial state |+z> is (|+y> + |−y>)/√2.

Now, when the field is applied along Y, the time evolution will be governed by H. The time evolution operator is exp(-i H t / ħ).

Since H |+y> = (gamma B ħ/2) |+y>, because Sy |+y> = (ħ/2) |+y>, so H = -gamma B Sy, so H |+y> = -gamma B (ħ/2) |+y> → E+ = -gamma B (ħ/2), same for |−y>, E− = gamma B (ħ/2).

Wait, wait. Let me recalculate. H = - gamma B Sy. Sy has eigenvalues ± ħ/2.

So H |+y> = -gamma B (ħ/2) |+y>

Similarly, H |−y> = -gamma B (- ħ/2) |−y> → gamma B (ħ/2) |−y>

So the energies are E+ = (- gamma B ħ )/ 2 and E− = (gamma B ħ)/2.

Now, the initial state is (|+y> + |−y>)/√2. So the time evolution is each component evolves with their respective phases.

So the time-evolved state |ψ(t)> is [exp(-i E+ t / ħ) |+y> + exp(-i E− t / ħ) |−y> ] /√2.

Plugging in E+ and E−:

E+ = (- gamma B ħ )/ 2 → exponent is (-i (-gamma B ħ / 2 ) t ) / ħ ) = (i gamma B t ) / 2.

Similarly, E− = (gamma B ħ )/ 2 → exponent is (-i (gamma B ħ /2 ) t ) / ħ ) = (-i gamma B t ) / 2.

So |ψ(t)> becomes [ exp(i gamma B t / 2 ) |+y> + exp( -i gamma B t / 2 ) |−y> ] /√2.

Now, we need to compute <mu_z>, which is gamma <S_z>.

Wait, mu is gamma S, so mu_z = gamma S_z. So <mu_z> = gamma <S_z>.

So we compute <S_z> = <ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)>.

But let's express S_z in terms of |+y> and |−y> basis. Hmm, perhaps it's easier to express |psi(t)> back in the |+z> and |−z> basis.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to express the expectation value in terms of the time-dependent state.

Wait, perhaps there's a smarter way. Let me think about the time evolution in terms of probabilities and the expectation value.

The state |ψ(t)> can be written as [ e^{i theta} |+y> + e^{-i theta} |−y> ] /√2, where theta = (gamma B t) / 2.

Expressed in terms of |+z> and |−z>, we can use the earlier expressions.

We have:

|+y> = (|+z> + |−z> ) /√2,

|−y> = (|+z> - |−z> ) /√2.

Substituting into |ψ(t)>:

[ e^{i theta} (|+z> + |−z> ) + e^{-i theta} (|+z> - |−z> ) ] / (√2 * √2 )

Simplify denominator: √2 * √2 = 2.

So numerator:

e^{i theta} (|+z> + |−z>) + e^{-i theta} (|+z> - |−z> )

= [ e^{i theta} + e^{-i theta} ] |+z> + [ e^{i theta} - e^{-i theta} ] |−z>

Which is:

2 cos(theta) |+z> + 2i sin(theta) |−z>

So |psi(t)> is [ 2 cos(theta) |+z> + 2i sin(theta) |−z> ] / 2

Simplify:

cos(theta) |+z> + i sin(theta) |−z>

So the state is |+z> cos(theta) + i |−z> sin(theta).

Now, compute <S_z> = < psi(t) | S_z | psi(t) >.

The expectation value <S_z> is the sum over the probabilities times their respective S_z values.

Wait, but S_z for |+z> is ħ/2, and for |−z> is -ħ/2.

So let's compute:

< psi(t) | S_z | psi(t) > = [ cos(theta) < +z | + i sin(theta) < -z | ] * S_z [ cos(theta) |+z> + i sin(theta) |−z> ]

So expanding:

= cos(theta) * cos(theta) < +z | S_z | +z > + cos(theta) * i sin(theta) < +z | S_z |−z > 
+ i sin(theta) * cos(theta) < −z | S_z | +z > + i sin(theta) * i sin(theta) < −z | S_z |−z >

Each of the terms:

< +z | S_z | +z > = ħ/2

< +z | S_z |−z> = 0 (since S_z |−z> = -ħ/2 |−z>, and < +z |−z> is zero.

Similarly, <−z | S_z | +z> = 0.

<−z | S_z |−z> = - ħ/2.

So the cross terms vanish, and we're left with:

= cos²(theta) (ħ/2) + (i^2) sin²(theta) (- ħ/2 )

i^2 is -1, so:

= (ħ/2) [ cos²(theta) - sin²(theta) ]

But [ cos²(theta) - sin²(theta) ] is cos(2 theta )

So <S_z> = (ħ/2) cos(2 theta )

But theta is (gamma B t)/2, so 2 theta = gamma B t.

So <S_z> = (ħ/2) cos(gamma B t )

But mu_z = gamma S_z → < mu_z > = gamma < S_z > = gamma ( ħ/2 ) cos(gamma B t )

The average mu_z oscillates with angular frequency omega = gamma B.

Wait, that would suggest the frequency is gamma B. Looking at the options, option B is gamma B.

Wait, but wait a second. The problem asks for the oscillation frequency. The function is cos(gamma B t), so the period is 2 pi / (gamma B). The frequency is gamma B / (2 pi ). Hmm, but wait, angular frequency is omega.

Wait, angular frequency is the coefficient in the exponential. Here, the oscillation is cos(omega t), so omega = gamma B. The frequency (in Hz) is omega/(2 pi), but the question is about the oscillation frequency, which I believe refers to the angular frequency. So the frequency is gamma B.

Hmm, but wait, let's go back. Did I make a mistake in the calculation?

Wait, let me recap. The state |psi(t)> was found to be |+z> cos(theta) + i |−z> sin(theta), where theta = (gamma B t)/2.

Then, <S_z> = (ħ/2) [ cos^2(theta) - sin^2(theta) ] = (ħ/2) cos(2 theta )

So 2 theta is gamma B t, so the argument is gamma B t. So the oscillation is at frequency gamma B, angular frequency.

So the average mu_z oscillates with angular frequency gamma B. So the frequency (angular) is gamma B.

Looking back at the options, option B is gamma*B.

Wait, but the question says the oscillation is of the average z-component of the particle’s moment. So, yes, that's mu_z, which is gamma S_z, and the average oscillates as (gamma ħ/2) cos(gamma B t). The amplitude is (gamma ħ/2), but the frequency is gamma B.

So the answer should be option B.


The problem involves a spin-1/2 particle with magnetic moment $\mu = \gamma S_z$, initially aligned with a magnetic field along the $+Z$ direction. When the field is suddenly switched to point along the $+Y$ direction, the Hamiltonian changes from being proportional to $S_z$ to being proportional to $S_y$. The goal is to determine the oscillation frequency of the average $z$-component of the particle’s magnetic moment, $\langle \mu_z \rangle$.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Initial State and Basis Transformation**:  
   Initially, the particle is in the eigenstate $|+z\rangle$ of $S_z$. After the magnetic field is switched to the $+Y$ direction, the Hamiltonian becomes $H = -\gamma B S_y$. The eigenstates of $S_y$ are $|+y\rangle$ and $|-y\rangle$, which are related to $|+z\rangle$ and $|-z\rangle$ as:  
   \[
   |+y\rangle = \frac{|+z\rangle + |-z\rangle}{\sqrt{2}}, \quad |-y\rangle = \frac{|+z\rangle - |-z\rangle}{\sqrt{2}}.
   \]  
   Thus, the initial state $|+z\rangle$ can be expressed as:  
   \[
   |+z\rangle = \frac{|+y\rangle + |-y\rangle}{\sqrt{2}}.
   \]

2. **Time Evolution**:  
   After the field change, the time evolution of the state is governed by the Hamiltonian $H = -\gamma B S_y$. The eigenstates $|+y\rangle$ and $|-y\rangle$ evolve with time-dependent phases:  
   \[
   |+y\rangle \to e^{-iE_+t/\hbar}|+y\rangle, \quad |-y\rangle \to e^{-iE_-t/\hbar}|-y\rangle,
   \]  
   where $E_+ = -\frac{\gamma B \hbar}{2}$ and $E_- = \frac{\gamma B \hbar}{2}$. Substituting these energies, the time-evolved state becomes:  
   \[
   |\psi(t)\rangle = \frac{e^{i\gamma B t / 2}|+y\rangle + e^{-i\gamma B t / 2}|-y\rangle}{\sqrt{2}}.
   \]  
   Expanding $|+y\rangle$ and $|-y\rangle$ in terms of $|+z\rangle$ and $|-z\rangle$, the state simplifies to:  
   \[
   |\psi(t)\rangle = \cos(\gamma B t / 2)|+z\rangle + i\sin(\gamma B t / 2)|-z\rangle.
   \]

3. **Expectation Value of $\mu_z$**:  
   The $z$-component of the magnetic moment is $\mu_z = \gamma S_z$. The expectation value $\langle \mu_z \rangle$ is proportional to $\langle S_z \rangle$, which is computed as:  
   \[
   \langle S_z \rangle = \langle \psi(t) | S_z | \psi(t) \rangle.
   \]  
   Substituting the time-evolved state, $\langle S_z \rangle$ oscillates as:  
   \[
   \langle S_z \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cos(\gamma B t).
   \]  
   Therefore, $\langle \mu_z \rangle = \gamma \langle S_z \rangle = \frac{\gamma \hbar}{2} \cos(\gamma B t)$. The oscillation frequency of $\langle \mu_z \rangle$ is determined by the angular frequency $\omega = \gamma B$.

4. **Answer Selection**:  
   Among the given options, the correct oscillation frequency is $\gamma B$, corresponding to **Option B**.

### Final Answer:
**Answer: B**
