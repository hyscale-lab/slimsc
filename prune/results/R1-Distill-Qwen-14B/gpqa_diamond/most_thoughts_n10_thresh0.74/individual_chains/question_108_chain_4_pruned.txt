Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about comparing the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy of a hydrogen atom. Hmm, let me see. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says the magnetic field B is parallel to the Oz axis and has a value of 1 Tesla. Oh right, the paramagnetic coupling term is part of the Hamiltonian when you have an external magnetic field. So the perturbing Hamiltonian H' is given by something like -μ·B, where μ is the magnetic moment. Wait, and μ for an electron is related to the spin, right? So μ = -gμ_B S, where g is the Landé g-factor, μ_B is the Bohr magneton, and S is the spin operator.

Wait, but I remember that for electrons, the spin magnetic moment is μ = -g_s μ_B (s), where s is the spin quantum number. Oh wait, no, more accurately, the expectation value would involve the spin magnetic quantum number m_s. So the energy due to the magnetic field would be something like H' = -μ·B. Since B is along Oz, let's say the z-direction. So H' becomes proportional to m_s.

But wait, the orbital magnetic quantum number is m here. Oh wait, in the question, it says 'small values of m'—wait, m is the orbital magnetic quantum number, which can be -l, ..., +l. For hydrogen, the orbital angular momentum is l, and m is its z-component. But wait, the magnetic field is applied, so the perturbation is due to the orbital magnetic dipole interaction. Hmm, or is it the spin interaction? I'm a bit confused.

Wait, the term 'paramagnetic coupling'—paramagnetism comes from the electron's spin, not its orbital motion. Oh wait, no, wait: no, wait, the orbital contribution is called diamagnetic, right? Or is it the other way around? Hmm. So paramagnetic materials have unpaired electrons, and the magnetic moment comes from the electron spin. So in this case, the coupling term would be the spin-orbit interaction? Or wait, the problem is about the paramagnetic coupling term, which is the Zeeman effect due to the spin.

Wait, but in the hydrogen atom, the spin-orbit coupling is a separate effect. Oh, wait, perhaps the paramagnetic term is the spin's interaction
