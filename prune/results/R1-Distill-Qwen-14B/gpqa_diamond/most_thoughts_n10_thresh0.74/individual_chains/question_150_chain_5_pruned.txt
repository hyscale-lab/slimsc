Okay, I have this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me read through it carefully. So, the compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO and some NMR data. Then it's reacted through a series of reagents. I need to figure out the final product from the options given.

First, I'll try to interpret the NMR data to determine the structure of the starting compound. The 1H NMR spectrum shows the following peaks:

- 9.72 ppm (t, 1H)
- 6.98 ppm (d, 2H)
- 6.51 ppm (d, 2H)
- 6.27 ppm (bs, 2H)
- 3.66 ppm (d, 2H)

Hmm. Let's break this down. 

The peak at 9.72 ppm is a triplet (t). That's pretty downfield, so probably an aldehyde proton. Wait, aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10 ppm as a singlet. But here it's a triplet, which is a bit odd. Or maybe it's an acidic proton, like from a phenol group? No, phenol protons are broader and maybe around 5 ppm. Wait, what else could be around 9.7? Maybe an enol or something adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group.

Looking at the other peaks: at 6.98 and 6.51, both doublets, each integrating for 2H. That might suggest a para-substituted aromatic ring, like a di-substituted benzene. The 6.98 is more downfield, so perhaps a substituent that deactivates the ring, like a nitro group or something else. But wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. So the substituents would have to fit into that.

Wait, the starting compound has a formula of C8H9NO. Let's calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So C=8, H=9, X=0 (no halogens), N=1. So (2*8 +2 -9 +1)/2 = (18-9+1)/2 = 10/2 =5. So five degrees: maybe a ring and some double bonds. 

Looking at the NMR, the aromatic signals are likely from two different aromatic rings. The 6.98 and 6.51 are each 2H as doublets. That suggests perhaps two para-substituted aromatic groups, each with substituents. Wait, but the 6.27 ppm is a broad singlet for 2H. Broad suggests perhaps an exchange process, like an -OH group. Wait, but in the given formula, N is presentâ€”so maybe an amino group? Or perhaps a ketone group, but the aldehyde is more likely.

Wait, the 3.66 ppm is a doublet for 2H. That's in the range of CH2 groups, maybe next to an oxygen or another group. So perhaps an OCH2 something.

Let me think of possible structures. The molecular formula is C8H9NO. So maybe the structure is something like a benzaldehyde derivative with some substituents. Let
