Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The first part says that 3,3,6-trimethylhepta-1,5-dien-4-one is treated with 1 equivalent of meta-chloroperbenzoic acid. Then it says two different products are formed, about a 1:1 ratio. Wait, meta-chloroperbenzoic acid (mCPBA) is a peracid, right? I remember that peracids are commonly used for epoxidation of alkenes. So, if there's an alkene present, mCPBA would add an epoxide group.

Looking at the structure of the starting material: 3,3,6-trimethylhepta-1,5-dien-4-one. Let me draw that. Hepta means seven carbons. The double bonds are at 1 and 5 positions, so positions 1-2 and 5-6 are double bonds. So the structure is:

1   2   3   4   5   6   7
CH2=CH-C(CH3)2-CO-CH2-CH(CH3)- ?

Wait, no. The structure would be:

Positions: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7

So, the substituents are:

At position 3: two methyl groups (3,3-dimethyl), and position 6: one methyl (6-methyl). The ketone is at position 4, so it's a heptan-4-one.

So the structure is: CH2=CH-C(CH3)2-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH3?

Wait, let me count the carbons again. Hepta is seven carbons. So 1,5-dien-4-one would have double bonds between 1-2 and 5-6. So:

1: CH2=
2: CH-
3: C(CH3)2-
4: C=O
5: CH2-
6: CH(CH3)-CH3.

Wait, maybe I should draw it more accurately.

The structure is:

CH2=CH-C(CH3)2-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH3.

Wait, but that's seven carbons. Let me number from 1
