Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me start by reading through the question carefully.

So, the problem is about a substance X reacting with liquid Y. The reaction releases a gas W, which has a molecule where the number of neutrons equals the number of protons. Also, a precipitate G forms, and when heated, G releases B. The melting point of B is around 277 K. Another clue is that when a certain keto acid reacts with X, the product has two oxygen atoms. X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, and it incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements.

The question asks me to find the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X. The options are A) 35, B) 25, C) 31, D) 29.

Hmm. Let's break this down step by step.

First, I think about what X could be. The fact that it's used in organic chemistry as a reagent makes me think of common reagents like NaOH, KOH, or maybe something like H2O. Wait, but it's known for incorporating a heavier isotope. Maybe it's a metal with a heavy isotope? Or perhaps a diatomic molecule where one element has a heavy isotope.

The reaction with Y produces a gas W. The gas has equal numbers of protons and neutrons. Let's think about possible gases. If W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons, the simplest case is when the molecule is made of a single atom with equal protons and neutrons. Because for a molecule, if it's diatomic, each atom would have equal numbers, but that would make the molecule have 2p and 2n. Or maybe W is a molecule where each atom has p = n, so the molecule as a whole has 2p and 2n. Alternatively, maybe the molecule is something like He or another noble gas, but let's think.

Wait, another approach: the gas W's molecule has the same number of protons and neutrons. So for a molecule like H2O, the total protons would be 2 (from O) + 2 (from H) each? No, wait, for each molecule, the total protons and neutrons.

Wait, maybe it's a molecule like CO2. But CO2 has C (6 protons) and O (8 each). Let me count the total protons and neutrons. Carbon has 6 protons, 6 neutrons (if it's 12C). Oxygen has 8 protons and 8 neutrons (if 16O). So CO2 would have 6 + 8*2 = 22 protons. Neutrons: 6 + 8*2 = 22. So 22 protons, 22 neutrons. That matches. So W could be CO2, which is a gas. But wait, when X reacts with Y, CO2 is released. What reactions produce CO2?

If X is a carbonate, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe X is a metal carbonate reacting with an acid? Or perhaps an acid reacting with a carbonate? Or maybe X is a hydroxide reacting with an acid.

Wait, another possibility: If Y is a strong acid, like H2SO4 or HCl, and X is a metal hydroxide. Then the reaction would produce water and a salt. But in that case, the gas might not be CO2. Alternatively, if Y is a carbonate, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is between a hydroxide and an acid, releasing water, but that wouldn't produce CO2.

Wait, another angle: If the gas is CO2, perhaps the reaction is between a carbonate and an acid. For example, CaCO3 + HCl → CaCl2 + CO2↑ + H2O. But in this case, Y would be HCl, and X would be CaCO3. But the problem says that X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. CaCO3 has Ca, C, and O. So if
