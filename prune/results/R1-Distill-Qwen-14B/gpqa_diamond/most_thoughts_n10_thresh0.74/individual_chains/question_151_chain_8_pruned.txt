Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, alright, let's try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it slow.

The problem says that the state of a system at time t is given by a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, but in quantum mechanics, the state vector should be a unit vector, right? Because the probabilities should add up to 1. Let me check. So the components are -1, 2, 1. The norm would be the square of each component added up. That's (-1)^2 + (2)^2 + (1)^2 = 1 +4 +1 = 6. Oh, so the norm squared is 6, which is greater than 1. That's strange. Oh wait! I think I remember that the state vector must be normalized, so probably this vector isn't normalized yet. So I should normalize it by dividing each component by the square root of 6. Because the state vector needs to have a length of 1. So the actual state vector is [ -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) ]^T.

Next, the observable is given by the matrix P. The matrix P has three rows. The first row is (0, 1/√2, 0), the second (1/√2, 0, 1/√2), and the third (0, 1/√2, 0). Hmm, so P is a 3x3 matrix. Observables in quantum mechanics are Hermitian operators, right? Because their eigenvalues are real, which correspond to possible measurement outcomes. Let me quickly check if P is Hermitian. A matrix is Hermitian if it equals its conjugate transpose. Looking at the elements, the matrix P has real entries, so the conjugate transpose is just the transpose. So let's see, the (1,2) element is 1/√2. The (2,1) element is also 1/√2, so that's good. The (1,3) element is 0, same as (3,1). The (2,3) is 1/√2, and (3,2) is also 1/√2. So yes, P is Hermitian. So that's correct.

The question is about finding the probability that measuring P yields 0. So in quantum mechanics, the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues of the observable. So first, I probably need to find the eigenvalues of P. Because the probability of getting a particular eigenvalue is given by the square of the amplitude of the corresponding eigenvector in the state vector.

Wait, but maybe there's another way. Alternatively, if I can write P in its diagonal form, or if I can find its eigenvalues and eigenvectors, then I can express the state in terms of the eigenvectors. The probability of measuring 0 is the square of the coefficient of the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue 0 in the state vector.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the expectation value, but no, the question is about the probability, not the expectation. So back to eigenvalues.

So, let's find the eigenvalues of P. To find
