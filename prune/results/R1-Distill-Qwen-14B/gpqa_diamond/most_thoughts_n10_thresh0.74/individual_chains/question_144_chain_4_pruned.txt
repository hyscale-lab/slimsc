Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to work through it.

The question is asking about the mean decay distance of a meson X. The given data includes the production energy E_X =8 GeV, mass m_X=1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are A, B, C, D, with various distances in meters.

Wait, right, when a particle decays, the mean lifetime is related to its width. The width Γ is the total decay width, which is connected to the particle's lifetime τ via the uncertainty principle. I remember that τ is inversely proportional to Γ. The formula is τ = ħ / Γ, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant.

But wait, how does that connect to the decay distance? Oh right, the mean decay length (or distance) is the product of the particle's velocity and its lifetime. So, L = v * τ.

So I need to calculate τ first, then multiply by the velocity v of the meson X.

First, let me figure out the velocity. The meson is produced with energy E_X =8 GeV. Its mass m_X is 1.2 GeV. To find the velocity, I can use the relativistic energy equation.

The total energy E is related to the rest mass and momentum by E² = (pc)² + (m c²)². So pc = sqrt(E² - (m c²)²).

Wait, but I need to compute the velocity
