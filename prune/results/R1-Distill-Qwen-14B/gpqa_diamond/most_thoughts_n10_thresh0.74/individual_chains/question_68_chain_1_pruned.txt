Alright, so I've got this problem about a spin-1/2 particle and its magnetic moment. Okay, let me try to think through this step by step.

The question says the particle has a magnetic moment mu equals gamma times Sz. So mu = γSz. Wait, Sz is the spin component in the z-direction, right? So the magnetic moment is proportional to that.

Initially, the magnetic field is along +Z. So the particle's moment is aligned with the field, I guess. Then, the magnetic field is turned off and another one is turned on along +Y. Both fields have the same magnitude, B. So the field switches from Z to Y direction, same strength.

The question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment after the field change. Hmm, I remember that when a magnetic field is applied, the spin precesses around the field direction. But wait, what happens when the field direction changes?

I think about the Hamiltonian here. The magnetic moment interacts with the magnetic field via the Zeeman term. The energy is proportional to B·mu, so H = -μ·B. Since mu is γ Sz, the Hamiltonian becomes H = -γ B S_z. But wait, when the field changes direction, the Hamiltonian changes.

Wait, no. Initially, the field is along Z, so the Hamiltonian is H_initial = -γ B S_z. Then the field is turned off (so B=0) and turned on along Y, so H_final = -γ B S_y.

Wait, but wait. Oh, when the field is suddenly changed, the spin state doesn't change instantaneously. So the initial state of the spin is the eigenstate of Sz because the field was along Z. So the initial state is |↑⟩ or |↓⟩ along Z.

But after the field is along Y, the system will start evolving under the new Hamiltonian H = -γ B S_y. So the time evolution will cause the spin state to change with time, leading to oscillations in the expectation values of observables.

The question asks about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the moment. So ⟨mu_z⟩ = γ ⟨S_z⟩. So to find the frequency of oscillations in ⟨S_z⟩, I can perhaps look at the time dependence of ⟨S_z⟩ under the new Hamiltonian.

Hmm, I remember that for a spin-1/2 particle, when the Hamiltonian is proportional to S_y, the energy eigenstates are |+y⟩ and |−y⟩. The time evolution under H = ω S_y (where ω is some frequency) would cause transitions between these states, leading to oscillations in expectation values.

Wait, let's write down the time evolution. The time-dependent Schrödinger equation says iħ |ψ(t)⟩ = H |ψ(t)⟩. Here, H is proportional to S_y. Let me think about the eigenvalues. The eigenvalues of S_y are ± ħ/2 for spin-1/2. So the energy levels are E_+ = (γ B)(ħ/2), E_- = -(gamma B)(ħ/2). Or wait, maybe I have the sign wrong. Let's see: H = -γ B S_y. So the eigenvalues would be E = -γ B (± ħ/2),
