Alright, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with all these reactions. But I'll try to think it through step by step.

Okay, the starting material is 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. Let me visualize that. So it's a cyclohexanone ring. The substituents are at positions 3 and 5. Position 3 has a hydroxymethyl group, which is CH2OH. Position 5 has a prop-1-en-2-yl group. Wait, prop-1-en-2-yl is like a vinyl group attached to the cyclohexane. So the structure is a cyclohexanone with a CH2OH at C3 and a CH2CH2 (but wait, no, wait. Prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2CHCH2? No, wait, propene is CH2=CHCH3. So prop-1-en-2-yl would be CH2CH2CH3 but with a double bond between C1 and C2. Wait, no, maybe it's CH2=CHCH2? No, wait, let me think again. The structure is CH2CH2CH3, but with the double bond between C1 and C2. So the substituent is at C5, so it's like cyclohexanone, C5 has a CH2-CH2 group, but wait, no. Wait, prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2=CH-CH2- but attached at the second carbon. Wait, no, the substituent is on the second carbon. So the group is CH2-CH2-CH3, but with a double bond between C1 and C2, making it CH2=CHCH2- attached at the middle carbon? Wait, maybe it's more like CH2=CH-CH2- but attached via the middle carbon, so it's the group CH2=CH-CH2- attached at the second carbon (so the double bond is between C1 and C2 of the propene). Alternatively, perhaps it's a substituent like cyclohexanone with a group at C5 being CH2-C(=CH2)-? Hmm, maybe I should draw this structure. But perhaps I can proceed without the exact
