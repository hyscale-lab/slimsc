Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky, and how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

Alright, the question says to assume stars are uniformly distributed. So that means the density of stars is the same everywhere. Parallax is the apparent shift in a star's position as seen from Earth when the Earth moves along its orbit. I remember that parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance. So a smaller parallax means the star is farther away.

Wait, how does parallax relate to distance again? Oh right, distance (d) in parsecs is 1 over the parallax (d = 1/plx). So plx is in arcseconds, and d is in parsecs. So as plx increases, the star is closer, right? Because if plx is 1 arcsecond, the distance is 1 parsec. If plx is 0.5, distance is 2 parsecs, etc.

Now, the question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. So we're looking at how many stars there are for a given change in parallax (like from plx to plx + dplx) and how that count depends on plx itself.

Since the stars are uniformly distributed, their number density is constant. Let's think in three dimensions. The number of stars in a small volume would be the volume multiplied by the number density. But parallax relates to distance, so maybe I need to consider the volume as a function of distance.

In a uniform distribution, the number of stars in a thin spherical shell at distance r with thickness dr would be proportional to the surface area of the shell (which is 4πr²) multiplied by the thickness dr. Because volume for a shell is 4πr² dr, and if density is uniform, the number of stars is density * 4πr² dr.

But wait, how does this relate to parallax? Since d = 1/plx, and r is the distance, so r = 1/plx. So plx is p = 1/r.

So let me express everything in terms of parallax p. Then, the number of stars in a shell with thickness dp would be proportional to 4π (1/p)^2 * (dp) * density. Because r is 1/p, so r² is 1/p².

Wait, but when p changes by dp, what's the corresponding change in r? Since r = 1/p, dr = -1/p² dp. But since we're dealing with a thin shell, the thickness in terms of distance is dr, but we can relate it to dp. So if we have a range from p to p + dp, then the distance change is dr = - (1/p²) dp. Hmm, but for small dp, the negative sign just indicates direction, but when considering the number of stars, it's about the absolute value.

So the number of stars in a shell with parallax between p and p + dp is proportional to 4π (r^2) dr. Substituting r = 1/p, so r^2 = 1/p². And dr is (1/p²) dp, since dr = -(1/p²) dp, but we take the absolute value for the count.

So putting it together: number of stars dN = 4π (1/p^2) * (1/p^2) dp * density. Wait, wait, hold on. Let me think again. The number of stars in a shell is proportional to 4π r² dr. Since dr = (1/p²) dp, substituting r=1/p gives dr = (1/(p^2)) dp.

So substituting, the number of stars is proportional to 4π (1/p^2) * (1/p²) dp. So that would be 4π (1/p^4) dp. So the number of stars per unit parallax (dN/dp) is proportional to 1/p^4.

But wait, the question is about the number per unit range of parallax. So for a given dp, how does the count change with p. Wait
