Okay, so I've got this question about the ESPRESSO spectrograph and which stars would be detectable. Let's see, I'm a bit rusty on my astronomy, but I'll try to think it through.

First, the question says that a star is detectable if it achieves a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 per binned pixel during a 1-hour exposure. The options are various stars, some with known brightness and distances.

I remember that the ESPRESSO spectrograph is used for high-resolution spectroscopy, right? And it's attached to the VLT, which is a big telescope. So the bigger the telescope, the more light it can gather, which should improve the S/N.

But wait, how does the S/N depend on the star's properties? I think it depends on the star's brightness, or its apparent magnitude. The brighter the star (lower apparent magnitude), the more photons we can detect, leading to a higher S/N.

So each star's apparent magnitude would determine if we can reach S/N >=10 in an hour. Let's break down each option.

Option a) Canopus. I know Canopus is a bright star. I think it's one of the brightest in the sky. Its apparent magnitude is around -0.7 or something like that. So very bright. Definitely should be detectable.

Option b) Polaris. Polaris is the North Star, and I think it's a second-magnitude star. Wait, Polaris is about magnitude 2, right? That's brighter than the Sun, which is about 5. So it's pretty bright, so likely detectable too.

Option c) A star with absolute V magnitude 15 mag at 10 pc. Absolute magnitude is how bright it would appear at 10 pc. So to find apparent magnitude, the formula is m = M + 5 log10(d/10), where d is distance in parsecs. So here M is 15, d is 10 pc. So m=15 + 5*(1) = 20. That's quite faint. The S/N would be low here. Wait, but how does the S/N relate to magnitude?

I remember that S/N scales with the square root of the number of photons. So if the star is too faint, the S/N might drop below 10 even with a big telescope and long exposure. Let's think about this.

Option e) Same M=15, d=5pc. So m=15 +5 log(5/10) =15 +5*(-0.301)=15-1.505=13.495. So mag ~13.5. That's still quite dim. The V band might not get enough photons.

Option f) M=15, d=50 pc. So m=15 +5 log(50/10)=15 +5*(1.69897)=15 +8.495=23.495. So about 23.5 mag. That's really faint. Probably not detectable.

Wait, but then what about the exposure time?
