Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll do my best.

The question is about identifying Compound X based on the reaction and the NMR spectra of the product. The reaction involves Compound X reacting with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. I remember that 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a common reagent used in the Sharpless epoxidation, which forms epoxides from epoxide precursors like epoxide alkenes. Wait, actually, Sharpless epoxidation is for making epoxides from certain dienes, but maybe the reaction here is about opening an epoxide ring? Or perhaps this reagent is used for something else. Hmm, I might be mixing things up. Alternatively, maybe it's a ring-opening or ring-closing metathesis? Or perhaps it's a different kind of reaction.

Wait, no. 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is also known as DBU, which is a strong, non-nucleophilic base. Oh, right! It's often used as a base in various reactions, like elimination reactions or as a catalyst in certain coupling reactions. So maybe Compound X is undergoing an elimination reaction here. But wait, the product's NMR shows some features that suggest epoxide or conjugated double bonds?

Looking at the product's 1H NMR: there are several signals. Let's list them out. We have δ 2.28 (3H, s) and 2.31 (3H, s) — two singlets, each integrating to 3H. That suggests two methyl groups. Then there are several aromatic signals: 6.75 (1H, d), 7.08 (2H, d), 7.68 (1H, d), and 7.71 (2H, d). The downfield shifts (like around 7.68 and 7.71) suggest some conjugation or deshielding, maybe due to an adjacent substituent like an electronegative group or an epoxide ring.

The 13C NMR is also given. Let's look at that. We have a carbon at δ 197.7, which is quite upfield for a carbonyl. Wait, oxo groups (like ketones) are usually higher, around 200s. But 197 is possible for an oxygenated carbonyl, like an ester or perhaps an epoxide? Or maybe an aldehyde? But I don't see an aldehyde proton in the 1H NMR.

Wait, in the 1H NMR, the upfield region has two singlets for methyl groups. So maybe two methyl groups attached to something that deshields them a bit, but not too much. Maybe attached to an electronegative atom, like an oxygen. So perhaps they're part of an ether or an epoxide ring.

Another thing to note: in the 13C NMR, the carbons are at
