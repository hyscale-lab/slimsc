Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric fields around a conducting sphere with a cavity. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step. 

Alright, the setup is an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R. Inside it, there's a small spherical cavity of radius r. The center of this cavity is a distance s away from the center of the conductor, and s must be less than R because r < R. Wait, no, s is the distance from the conductor's center to the cavity's center, so s should be positive but less than R because the cavity is entirely inside the conductor. 

Now, a small positive charge +q is placed somewhere inside this cavity. The question is about finding the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is at a distance L from the conductor's center, and the distance from P to the cavity's center is l. Also, l and L are both greater than R, which makes sense because P is outside. The angle between l and s is theta. 

Hmm, I remember from Gauss's Law that for a spherical conductor, the charges redistribute themselves on the surface. But wait, the conductor is uncharged initially, so any charges inside the cavity would induce charges on the inner and outer surfaces. Oh right, when a charge is inside a cavity of a conductor, it induces an equal and opposite charge on the inner surface, and then the outer surface must have a charge equal to the total to maintain the conductor's neutrality. Wait, but in this case, the conductor is initially uncharged, right? So when we place +q inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor (the cavity's wall) will have -q, and the outer surface will have +q to balance. 

But wait, the conductor itself is uncharged. So the total charge on the conductor is zero. So the inner surface must have -q, and the outer surface must have +q. Because the conductor was neutral, so anything inside the cavity would induce a charge on the inner surface, and the outer surface must have the same as the charge placed inside to keep the total conductor charge zero. Wait, no, wait: the conductor's total charge is zero. So inner surface is -q, outer surface is +q. So that the total conductor charge is (-q + q) = 0. So that's correct.

But wait, the point P is outside the conductor. So when evaluating the electric field at P, what's the distribution of charges that
