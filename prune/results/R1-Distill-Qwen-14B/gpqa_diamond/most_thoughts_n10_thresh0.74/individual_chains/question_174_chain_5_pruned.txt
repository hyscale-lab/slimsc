Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. It's about nuclear fission and the kinetic energy of the fragments. Hmm, let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a shot.

So the problem says that an atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest, and its rest-mass energy is 300 GeV. Wait, rest-mass energy is given by E=mc², so M must be around that. But I don't think I need to calculate M directly; maybe the units will help.

Then it undergoes spontaneous fission, splitting into two fragments. One is twice as massive as the other. Oh wait, when it says 'twice more massive', I should pay attention. So if the less massive is m, the other is 2m. So the total rest mass of the fragments is m + 2m = 3m. But wait, the sum of their rest masses is 99% of the initial mass M. So 3m = 0.99 M. Therefore, M is approximately 3m / 0.99, but I'm not sure yet. Wait, wait, but the initial nucleus has a rest-mass energy of 300 GeV, which is equal to Mc². So M is 300 GeV / c². But perhaps I can work in units where c=1 for simplicity, so M = 300 GeV.

Wait, but the problem says the sum of rest masses is 99% of M. So 3m = 0.99 M. So m = (0.99 M) / 3. Let me compute that. M is 300 GeV, so 0.99 * 300 = 297 GeV. 297 /3 = 99 GeV. So m is 99 GeV, and the other fragment is 198 GeV. So the two fragments have rest masses of 99 GeV and 198 GeV respectively.

Since the initial nucleus is at rest, the total momentum before fission is zero. So after fission, the two fragments must move in opposite directions with equal and opposite momenta to conserve momentum. So their momenta must be equal in magnitude but opposite in direction.

We need to find the kinetic energy
