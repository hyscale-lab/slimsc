Okay, so I've got this question about particle physics, specifically about the decay of a boson. Hmm, let me try to break it down. 

The problem gives me a Lagrangian: L(y) = -λf ψ̄f (y) (v + X(y)) ψf(y). Wait, I'm a bit rusty on the notation, but I think this is describing an interaction between the boson field X and some fermion fields. The fermions are probably something like quarks or leptons. 

The mass of the boson X is given as 6 GeV. So, the question is about what particles this boson can decay into, right? And the options are various combinations of fermion-antifermion pairs.

I remember that for a particle to decay into a pair of fermions, the mass of the boson must be at least twice the mass of the fermion. Because E=mc², so energy has to be enough to create the rest mass of both particles. So, X's mass is 6 GeV. 

Wait, but what fermions are available? Let's think about the possible particles. The options include things like bottom quarks (b), strange (s), up (u), down (d), tau leptons, and electrons. Also, others like charm (c), top quarks (t), muons, etc.

So, each of these fermions has a certain mass. I need to find which ones have a mass less than or equal to 3 GeV because 6 GeV divided by 2 is 3 GeV. Because each fermion and antifermion would take up half the energy.

Let me go through each possible fermion:

- Electron (e): very light, mass around 0.0005 GeV. So yes, 2*m_e is negligible, so allowed.
- Muon (μ): mass is about 0.1 GeV. So 2*0.1=0.2 GeV, which is way below 6 GeV. So allowed.
- Tau (τ): mass is around 1.78 GeV. So 2*1.78=3.56 GeV. Wait, that's more than 3 GeV. So can X decay into tau pairs? Wait, because 3.56 is bigger than 3, so 6 GeV is more than 3.56. So yes, because 6 is bigger than 3.56. Wait, wait, no, because 2m_τ is 3.56 GeV. Wait, X has mass 6 GeV, which is more than 3.56, so yes, it can decay into τ+ τ-.

Wait, wait, wait. Wait, the rest mass of the tau is about 1.78 GeV. So 2m_τ is about 3.56 GeV. X is 6 GeV, which is more than 3.56, so yes, decay into tau pairs is allowed.

What about quarks? Let's think about their masses. 

- Up quark (u): mass around 2 MeV (0.002 GeV). So 2m_u is 0.004 GeV. So yes, allowed.
- Down quark (d): similar to u, about 3-5 MeV. So 2m_d is about 0.01 GeV. Allowed.
- Strange quark (s): around 95-100 MeV (0.095-0.1 GeV). So 2m_s is about 0.19 GeV. Allowed.
- Charm quark (c): around 1.2-1.5 GeV. So 2m_c is about 2.4-3 GeV. Wait, 3 GeV is the limit. Since X is 6 GeV, 2m_c is about 3 GeV. So yes, 3 GeV is equal to half of X's mass, so decay into c c-bar is allowed.
- Bottom quark (b): mass around 4.1-4.7 GeV. So 2m_b is about 8.2-9.4 GeV. Oh wait, that's more than X's mass (6 GeV), so X cannot decay into b quarks. Because 6 GeV is less than 8 GeV. So X cannot decay into b b-bar pairs. So any option that includes b quarks is incorrect.

Wait, but wait: the options have 'b' in some. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options:

Option A: X→b b-bar, s, u, d, tau, e. But wait, since X is 6 GeV, and 2*m_b is about 8.2 GeV, which is
