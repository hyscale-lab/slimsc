Okay, so I've got this problem about four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. The question asks for the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state. The options are multiple-choice, and I need to figure out which one is correct. Hmm, let me think.

Wait, the particles are spin-1/2, which means they're fermions, right? So they obey the Pauli exclusion principle. Each particle must occupy a unique quantum state. In a 1D infinite well, the energy levels are quantized. The energy for a single particle is given by E_n = (n² π² ħ²)/(2mL²) = n² E, since E is defined as pi²ħ²/(2mL²). So each particle's energy is E multiplied by its quantum number squared.

But since there are four particles, I need to assign each a different state. Because they're fermions, they can't all be in the same state. So each must have a different set of quantum numbers. But in a 1D box, the quantum number is just n, so for each particle in the same spatial state, their spin has to be different. Wait, spin-1/2 particles have two possible spin states, so each spatial state can hold two particles—one with spin up and one with spin down.

Okay, so for four particles, how do they fill up the energy levels? Let's see. The ground state would be the lowest possible configuration.

In the ground state, you want the lowest energy levels filled. The lowest energy is n=1, which can hold two particles (spin up and spin down). Then the next level is n=2, which can also hold two particles. So in the ground state, all four particles are in the first two energy levels. But wait, no, because the first energy level (n=1) can hold two, and the next (n=2) can hold two as well. So four particles would fill n=1 and n=2. But wait, for four particles with spin-1/2, each spatial state (n) can hold two, so n=1 has two, n=2 has two. That would mean the total energy is the sum of each particle's energy.

But wait, each particle in n=1 contributes E*(1)^2 = E, and each in n=2 contributes E*(2)^2 =4E. So two particles in n=1 give 2E, and two in n=2 give 8E. So the total energy of the system in the ground state is 2E + 8E = 10E? Wait, no, wait. Because each particle's energy is E, 4E, etc. So the first two particles are in n=1 with E each, so 2E. The next two are in n=2, each 4E, so 8E. So total is 2E + 8E = 10E? Wait, that can't be right because looking at the options, option B has 4E, 10E, 50E. Option D starts at 10E. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of each energy level's contribution. Oh wait, no. Each particle's energy is n² E. So when you have two particles in n=1, that's 2*(1^2 E) =2E. Two in n=2 is 2*(2^2 E) =8E. So total is 2E +8E=10E. So the ground state is 10E. But wait, let me think again. Because maybe the four particles can't all be in n=1 and n=2 because each n can only have two particles. So yes, that's correct.

Now, what about the first excited state? The first excited state would be the next possible configuration where the particles are in higher energy levels, but how?

Wait, perhaps the ground state is when the particles are in the lowest possible n's. The first excited state would involve promoting one of the particles to the next available n. Let me think about the possible ways to arrange four particles into the lowest energies.

Wait, maybe the ground state is when n=1 has two particles, and n=2 has two, so total energy is 2*(1) + 2*(4) = 2 +8 =10E. That's the ground state.

The first excited state would be when one of the particles is promoted to a higher energy level. But which one? Since the ground state is filled with four particles, perhaps the next available state is n=3.

But wait, each n can only have two particles because spin up and down. So after n=2, the next is n=3. So in the first excited state, perhaps one particle is promoted to n=3. But wait, no, because you can't have more than two particles in a single n. So actually, you can't have three particles in n=1; each n holds two.

So the first excited state would have two particles in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3. Wait, no, because each n can hold two. So perhaps the first excited state is when two are in n=1, two in n=2. That's the ground state. Wait, no, that's ground. So first excited would be when you have two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3. But wait, no, because n=2 can hold two. Let's see. Maybe the first excited state
