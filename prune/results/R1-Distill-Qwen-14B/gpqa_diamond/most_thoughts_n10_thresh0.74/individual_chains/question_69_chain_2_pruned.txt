Okay, let's tackle this physics problem. So, the question is about the CERN Bubble Chamber and the decay of a particle X⁰ into Y⁺ and Z⁻. The proper lifetime of X⁰ is given as τ₀ = 8 × 10^-16 seconds. We need to find the minimum resolution required to observe at least 30% of the decays.

Hmm, I remember that particles moving at relativistic speeds will experience time dilation. So, the lifetime observed in the lab frame (τ) would be longer than the proper lifetime τ₀. The formula for time dilation is τ = γτ₀, where γ is the Lorentz factor. γ is given by the equation 1/√(1 - v²/c²), which can also be approximated as E/(m c²) when the particle is moving at a high speed.

Wait, the energy of the particle X⁰ is given as 27 GeV, and its mass is 3.41 GeV. So, I can calculate γ using E = γ m c². Rearranging that, γ = E/(m c²). But since both E and m are in GeV, the c² terms might cancel out when considering units in natural units where c=1. So, perhaps I don't need to worry about the actual value of c here.

So, γ would be 27 GeV divided by 3.41 GeV. Let me compute that. 27 / 3.41 is approximately 7.917. So, γ is about 7.917.

Wait, so the lifetime in the lab frame τ is γ τ₀. Let me calculate that. τ = 7.917 * 8e-16 s. Let's compute that: 7.917 * 8 = 63.336, so 63.336e-16 seconds, which is 6.3336e-15 seconds.

But how does this relate to the resolution needed? Oh right, the resolution of the detector (the Bubble Chamber) determines how well it can measure the position where the decay occurs. The minimum resolution needed is related to the uncertainty in the position the particle can travel during its lifetime, as seen in the lab frame.

Wait, the particles are moving, so the distance they travel before decaying is vτ. The uncertainty in the position (Δx) would be approximately vτ. But wait, we might not know v exactly, but perhaps we can use the relation between energy and momentum to find v.

Alternatively, in high-energy physics, it's often a good approximation that the velocity v is very close to the speed of light c. Since γ is about 8, which is a significant factor, the particles are moving at a significant fraction of c. But for precise calculations, maybe I should find the exact velocity.

Let me think. The energy E is given, which is the total energy (γ m c²). The momentum p is γ m v. Alternatively, p = gamma * m * v. But perhaps it's easier to find the velocity using the relation between energy and momentum.

Wait, another approach: the velocity can be found from beta (β), where β = v/c. The relation between gamma and beta is gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta²). Also, beta can be found from gamma as beta = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²).

So, let me compute beta. Gamma is approximately 7.917.

Compute 1/gamma squared: 1/(7.917)^2 ≈ 1/62.7 ≈ 0.01594. So, 1 - 0.01594 = 0.98406. The square root of that is sqrt(0.98406) ≈ 0.992. So beta is approximately 0.992, meaning v ≈ 0.992c.

So, v is approximately 0.992 times the speed of light. Let's take c as
