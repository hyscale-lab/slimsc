Okay, so I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem. Let's read it carefully.

The question is about a substance X that reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing a gas W. The gas W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. Then a precipitate G forms, which when heated releases B. B's melting point near 277 K is very close. There's also something about a keto acid reacting with X to form a product with two oxygen atoms. X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, and its analog is similar. The task is to find the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X.

Hmm. Let's break this down step by step.

First, let's think about the reaction between X and Y. Violent reaction—maybe something like a metal reacting with an acid. Y is liquid; could it be water, an acid, or maybe a base?

The gas W has the same number of neutrons and protons. So, for a gas molecule, same n and p. That suggests maybe hydrogen because H has 1 proton and 0 neutrons? Wait, no, because H's isotope deuterium would have 1 proton and 1 neutron. But wait, the gas molecule must have the same number of n and p in each molecule. So for example, if the molecule is H2, each H has 1 p and 0 n. So n=0, p=1. That doesn't match. Wait, but if the molecule is D2 (deuterium), each D has 1 p and 1 n. So each molecule would have 2 D atoms, each with 1 p and 1 n. So the molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. But the total would be 2 protons and 2 neutrons, so same number. So the molecule would have same number of protons and neutrons. So gas W is probably H2 or D2? But since the problem mentions that X incorporates a heavier isotope, perhaps it's D2?

Alternatively, maybe CO2? No, because CO2 has 12 C (6 p, 6n) and 2 O (8p, 8n each). So total would be 6+16=22 p, 6 + 16*2=38 n? Not same. Hmmm. Let me think—another possibility is NH3? No, ammonia has 14 p, 14 n (each N has 7 p and 7n; H has 1 p and 0 n each). Wait, the molecule's total p and n? For example, if the molecule is H2O: each O has 8 p, 8 n; H has 1 p. So total p is 8+2=10; n is 8. Not same. Hmm.

Wait another approach: the gas W's molecule has the same number of protons and neutrons in each molecule. Let me think about common gases. Hydrogen gas is H2, each H has 1p, 0n. So total p:2, n:0. Not same. Helium is He, which is 2p, 2n. So each He atom has 2p and 2n. So the molecule is He, which has 2p and 2n. So same. So W could be helium? But that seems less likely in a reaction with a metal. Or maybe another noble gas, like neon? No, because neon has 10p and 10n? Wait, neon has atomic number 10, so 10 protons, and, assuming it's the isotope Ne-20, 10 neutrons. So a molecule of Ne would have 10p and 10n. So same. So W could be Ne gas. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the gas is CO because carbon has 6p and 6n, oxygen has 8p and 8n. So CO has (6+8) =14 p and (6+8)=14 n. So same. So molecule of CO would have 14p and 14n. But CO is a gas under certain conditions. Alternatively, maybe it's CH4? No. Methane has 6p (C) + 4*(1) = 10p. Neuterons: C has 6, H has 0 each. So 6. Not same.

Alternatively, maybe the gas is O2. Each O has 8p, 8n. So O2 would have 16p and 16n. So same. So W could be O2. But does that fit the reaction?

Wait, but when a metal reacts with an acid, gas is H2. So maybe W is H2? But then p=2, n=0: not same. Hmm. So that doesn't fit. Another possibility is that W is CH4? No, wait, how about if W is H2O? No, because H2O is a liquid,
