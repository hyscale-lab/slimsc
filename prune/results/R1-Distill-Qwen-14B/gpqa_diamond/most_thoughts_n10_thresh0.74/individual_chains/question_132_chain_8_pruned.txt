Okay, so I've got this NMR problem in front of me. I'm a bit rusty on my aromatic NMR spectra, but let's see if I can work through this step by step.

The question says that the solution is a 1:1 mixture of two aromatic compounds with the formula C10H14. The 1H NMR shows two singlets around 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio, and three singlets around 2.2 ppm in a 2:1:1 ratio. The options are four different tetramethylbenzenes and a diethylbenzene.

First, let me parse the molecular formula. Each compound is C10H14. Since benzene is C6H6, the substituents must account for 4 carbons and 8 hydrogens. Wait, 10-6=4 carbons, and 14-6=8 hydrogens. So each compound has four substituents on the benzene ring.

Wait, no. Wait, wait. C10H14: benzene is C6H6, so the substituent is C4H8. Hmm. But substituents on benzene are usually groups like methyl, ethyl, etc. Let me think: Each substituent is a group attached to the ring. So for example, if it's tetramethylbenzene, then four methyl groups (each -CH3) would contribute 4 carbons and 12 hydrogens (since each CH3 has 3 H). Wait, but wait: each methyl is -CH3, so four methyl groups would add 4*(CH3) = 4C and 12 H. But the benzene itself is C6H5 (if it's mono-substituted, but in the case of multiple substituents, each substituent replaces a hydrogen). So, the total formula would be C6H6 -4 H (since four substituents) + 4 CH3. Let me calculate that.

Benzene is C6H6. Each substituent replaces an H. For four substituents, that's 4 H removed. So the structure is C6H6 -4 H + 4*(CH3). So the formula is C6 +4C= C10, and H: 6 -4 + (4*3) = 6-4+12=14. So yes, that fits C10H14. So both compounds are tetramethylbenzenes, or maybe one is something else, but looking at the options, most are tetramethyl except option C, which includes diethyl.

Wait the options include 1,4-diethylbenzene. Let me check that. Diethyl groups would be two substituents, each -CH2CH3. So two substituents would contribute 4 carbons (each ethyl is two carbons) and 6*2=12 hydrogens? Wait, each ethyl has two CH2 groups: -CH2CH3. Each has 2+3=5 H. Two ethyl groups would be 10 H. The benzene would lose two H, so 6-2=4 H. So total H would be 4 + 10 =14. So the formula for 1,4-diethylbenzene is C6H4 + 2*(C2H5) = C10H14. So yes, that's correct.

So the options are a mix of tetramethylbenzenes and diethylbenzene.

Now, looking at the NMR data: two singlets at around 6.7 ppm, in a 1:1 ratio, and three singlets at ~2.2 ppm in 2:1:1 ratio.

The aromatic region (6.7 ppm) is important. Each singlet would correspond to a set of equivalent aromatic protons. So each compound in the mixture would have a certain pattern in the aromatic region. Since the mixture is 1:1, the integration ratio of 1:1 for the two signals suggests that each compound contributes one singlet each.

Wait, but each singlet in the aromatic region corresponds to a unique set of protons. So each compound might have a certain number of equivalent protons in their aromatic regions.

Wait, if each compound contributes one singlet, that would mean each has only one type of aromatic proton. So their structures would have all equivalent aromatic protons. That would happen in highly symmetrical structures.

What symmetries in tetramethylbenzenes would lead to a single set of equivalent aromatic protons?

Let me think. Let's consider the options.

First, 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene: this is also known as 1,2,3,4-tetraethyl benzene? Wait, no, it's four methyl groups. Wait, the structure is four methyl groups at the 1,2,3,4 positions. That would be a highly symmetrical structure. Let me imagine the benzene ring with four methyl groups adjacent to each other. Wait no, 1,2,3,4 positions would be four substituents in a row, which would make a sort of square-like arrangement. Wait, but benzene is a six-membered ring. 1,2,3,4 positions would mean four substituents on the first four carbons, but that's a bit unclear. Wait, maybe it's a para arrangement? Hmm.

Alternatively, looking at each option:

Option A: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.

Option B: 1,2,4,5 and 1,2,3,4.

Option D: 1,2,4,5 and 1,
