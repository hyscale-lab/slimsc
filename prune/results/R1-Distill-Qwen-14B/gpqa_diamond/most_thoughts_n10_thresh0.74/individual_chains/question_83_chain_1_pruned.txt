Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me. It's about titration, which I remember has to do with neutralizing acids and bases. The question is a bit detailed, so I need to break it down step by step.

First, the problem says we're diluting 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then, we titrate this diluted solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given, and I have to choose the correct one.

Hmm, let me think. Acetic acid is a weak acid, right? And NaOH is a strong base, so it'll completely dissociate. When you titrate a weak acid with a strong base, you form the acetate ion, which is the conjugate base of acetic acid. So, the equivalence point would involve some kind of buffer solution, but wait, no, because at equivalence, all the acetic acid would have been neutralized to its conjugate base. Wait, no, actually, in a titration, the equivalence point is when the moles of base equal the moles of acid. But since acetic acid is a weak acid, the solution at equivalence will have the conjugate base (acetate) in solution, which can hydrolyze to form OH- ions, making the solution basic. So, the pH at equivalence should be above 7.

But wait, let me get back to the problem. First, I need to find out what's happening at 25% titration and at the equivalence point.

Let's tackle each part one by one.

Starting with the initial solution: we have 20.00 cm³ (which is 0.020 L) of 0.05 M acetic acid. The amount in moles is Molarity × Volume, so 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 moles. Then, we dilute it with 20 cm³ of water. So the total volume is 40 cm³ (0.04 L). The new concentration after dilution is moles / volume, which is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. So the concentration of acetic acid after dilution is 0.025 M.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, wait a minute. Wait, when you mix 20 cm³ of acid with 20 cm³ of water, the total volume is 40 cm³. So the diluted concentration is correct.

Now, when we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH, the reaction is:

CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^-Na+ + H2O

So, each mole of NaOH neutralizes a mole of acetic acid. At 25% titration, that means 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by the NaOH. So I need to find the pH at that point.

Let me calculate the moles involved.
