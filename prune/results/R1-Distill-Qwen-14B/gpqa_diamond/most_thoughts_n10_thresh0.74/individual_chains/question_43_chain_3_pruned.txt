Alright, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about naming a benzene ring with several substituents. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to think it through.

Okay, the question says the benzene ring has a carboxylic acid, a carbaldehyde (which I think is an aldehyde group), and a cyano group, all meta to one another. So, that means each of these three groups is separated by one carbon from each other because meta is 1,3 positions.

Wait, wait. No, wait, meta substituents are three positions apart. So if one group is in position 1, the next meta would be 3, and the next meta would be 5. But wait, benzene is a six-membered ring, so positions 1,3,5 are all meta to each other. So the three groups (carboxylic acid, aldehyde, cyano) are at positions 1,3,5. But which one is where?

Wait, actually, the problem says they are meta to one another. So each is meta to the others, which makes them all in 1,3,5 positions. So, the carboxylic acid, aldehyde, and cyano groups are in positions 1,3,5. But the problem then goes on to mention other substituents.

So, the other substituents: ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl and a dimethyl amino group. So, looking at position 2 and position 6 of the ring (since the carboxylic acid is in position 1, ortho is 2 and 6). So, positions 2 and 6 have the hydroxyl and the dimethyl amino groups. But which is which?

The problem states that the hydroxyl and dimethyl amino are both ortho to the carboxylic acid. So one substituent is in position 2 and the other in 6.

Then, para to the carboxylic acid is a methoxy group. Since the carboxylic acid is in position 1, para would be position 4. So position 4 has the methoxy group.

Wait, but earlier, the substituents meta to the carboxylic acid are the aldehyde and cyano. Wait, no, the problem says the three groups (carboxylic acid, aldehyde, and cyano) are all meta to each other. So
