Alright, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll think it out.

Okay, the starting point is a methanol solution of (R)-(+)-limonene. Limonene is a cyclic monoterpene, right? I remember it's a bicyclic monoterpene, specifically a cyclic monoterpene with a bicyclic structure. So, limonene is (R)-configuration, which means it's the (+) enantiomer.

The first reaction is with Pd/C under hydrogen. Pd/C is a catalyst, and hydrogen means it's a hydrogenation reaction. Since limonene is a terpene with double bonds, hydrogenation would probably add hydrogen across those double bonds. But wait, limonene has two double bonds, I think. Or wait, no, limonene has one double bond, right? Because it's a cyclic monoterpene, like menthol but different. Wait, no, limonene is a bicyclic monoterpene with a single double bond. So hydrogenation would reduce that double bond.

Wait, but limonene is (R)-configuration. So when hydrogenated, it would form a cyclohexane derivative. Let me think, when limonene (which is a bicyclic structure, maybe like a cyclohexene ring?), upon hydrogenation, would become a cyclohexane. But wait, limonene is a cyclic monoterpene with a double bond. Oh wait, limonene is actually a bicyclic molecule with two rings, right? Oh, no, wait, limonene is a cyclic monoterpene with a single double bond in a six-membered ring. So when hydrogenated, it would become a cyclohexane, possibly with some substituents.

Wait, (R)-limonene is a chiral molecule. So when we hydrogenate it, the stereochemistry might change. So limonene is (R)-configuration. So the structure is a cyclohexene derivative. Upon hydrogenation, the double bond becomes a single bond, so the molecule becomes a cyclohexane.

So after hydrogenation, product 1 is the hydrogenated limonene. But wait, the question says after 1 equivalent of hydrogen is consumed. So maybe the starting limonene has one double bond, so one equivalent of hydrogen would saturate that. So the product is the cyclohexane derivative, which would have a certain configuration.

Wait, but limonene's structure is a bicyclic monoterpene. Hmm, maybe it's actually a bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene, like the structure of limonene. Oh wait, no, limonene is a cyclic monoterpene, but maybe it's a bicyclic structure. Alternatively, perhaps limonene is a substituted cyclohexene.

Wait, okay, let's get the structure right. Limonene is a cyclic monoterpene with the structure (R)-5-methyl-2-(1-methylethenyl)cyclohex-1-ene. So it's a cyclohexene ring with a substituent at position 5 (a methyl group) and another at position 2 (a isopropenyl group, I think). So when hydrogenated, the double bond (between C1 and C2) would add two hydrogens, converting the cyclohexene to cyclohexane.

So product 1 would be 5-methyl-2-(1-methylethyl)cyclohexane. Wait, so the substituents are a methyl at position 5 and an isopropyl group at position 2. So the configuration around the ringâ€”since the starting limonene is (R), when we hydrogenate it, the substituents would have certain configurations.

Wait, but wait, limonene is (R) configuration. So after hydrogenation, the substituents would be in a certain spatial arrangement. Wait, hydrogenation of a double bond can affect the stereochemistry. If the starting double bond is E or Z, the hydrogenation would lead to either retention or inversion. Wait, but hydrogenation of a double bond in a ring would typically add hydrogen across the double bond, leading to a
