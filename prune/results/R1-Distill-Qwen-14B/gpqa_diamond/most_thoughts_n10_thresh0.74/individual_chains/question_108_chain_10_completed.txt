Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about comparing the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy of a hydrogen atom. Hmm, let me try to unpack what's being asked here.

The question says that the magnetic field B is parallel to the Oz axis and has a value of 1 Tesla. They also mention that m is small, which I'm pretty sure refers to the orbital magnetic quantum number. The task is to compare the magnitude of the paramagnetic coupling term (which I think is the energy term due to the interaction between the magnetic moment and the external field) with the transition energy ΔE of the hydrogen atom. The wavelength given is λ = 0.4861 μm, which I remember is around the wavelength for the Balmer series in hydrogen, like the H-alpha line.

Wait, so I need to find out which of the options A to D is correct. The options are about whether the expectation value of H (the Hamiltonian) is much greater than, much less than, equal to, or just greater than ΔE.

Let me think about the paramagnetic coupling term first. I recall that in the presence of a magnetic field, atoms can have a magnetic moment due to their electrons. The energy associated with this interaction is given by the Zeeman effect. The Hamiltonian term for this is H = -μ·B, where μ is the magnetic moment. For an electron, μ is proportional to the magnetic quantum number m. The formula I remember is μ = g * (eħ/(2m_e)) * m, where g is the gyromagnetic ratio (or Landé g-factor), e is electron charge, ħ is the reduced Planck's constant, and m_e is the electron mass.

So the energy from this term would be something like H = -μ·B = -g * (eħ/(2m_e)) * m * B. But wait, m here is the magnetic quantum number, so it's an integer. Since m is small, maybe it's zero or ±1, but I'm not sure how that plays into it.

On the other hand, the transition energy ΔE is related to the wavelength of the emitted or absorbed photon. The energy of a photon is given by E = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant and c is the speed of light. Let me compute this for the given wavelength.

The wavelength λ is 0.4861 micrometers, which is 486.1 nanometers. So plugging into E = hc/λ, I can compute ΔE.

Wait, let me get the numerical values straight. Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626 x 10^-34 J·s. The speed of light c is about 3.00 x 10^8 m/s. So hc is roughly 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Dividing by λ=486.1e-9 meters (since 1 nm is 1e-9 m), so hc/λ is 1.9878e-25 / 486.1e-9 = Let me compute that: 1.9878e-25 / 4.861e-7 = approx 4.087e-19 J. Hmm, but that's in joules. To get it in electron volts, I can convert it using 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J. So 4.087e-19 J is about 4.087e-19 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 2.55 eV. Wait, that seems a bit high. Wait, wait, wait, the Balmer series transitions typically have energy differences in the range of about 3.5 eV (for H-alpha). Oh wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation. Let me double-check.

Wait, λ = 486.1 nm is about 486.1e-9 meters. So hc is 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m. So hc/λ = 1.9878e-25 / 486.1e-9 = let me compute that:

Compute denominator: 486.1e-9 = 4.861e-7 m.
So 1.9878e-25 / (4.861e-7) = (1.9878 / 4.861) * 1e-25 / 1e-7 = approximately 0.4088 * 1e-18 = 4.088e-19 J. So that's about 4.088e-19 J.

Converting to eV: 4.088e-19 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 2.55 eV. Hmm, but I thought the Balmer transition (H-alpha) is about 1.89 eV. Wait, maybe I'm getting the wavelength wrong. Wait, H-alpha has a wavelength of about 656 nm, not 486. So 486 nm is H-beta, which is a higher energy transition. Let me confirm the energy of H-beta. The energy levels in hydrogen are given by ΔE = 13.6 eV * (1/(n_initial^2) - 1/(n_final^2)). For Balmer series, n_final is 2.

So, for example, the transition from n=4 to n=2 (which gives H-beta at 486 nm) would have energy ΔE = 13.6*(1/4 - 1/16) = 13.6*(3/16) = 13.6 * 0.1875 = 2.55 eV. Yes, that matches what I had earlier. So the transition energy ΔE is about 2.55 eV.

Now, the paramagnetic coupling term. So the paramagnetic term is the Zeeman energy. Let's compute that. The energy per electron would be E_Zeeman = μ_B * B * m, where μ_B is the Bohr magneton. But wait, wait, the formula for the Zeeman effect is E = -μ·B, and μ = g * μ_B * m, where g is the Landé g-factor.

Wait, the Bohr magneton μ_B is given by (eħ)/(2m_e), which is approximately 9.274e-24 J/T. So the energy would be E = μ_B * B * m. But wait, I'm not sure about the exact expression. Let me think again. The Zeeman term is H = -μ·B. μ = -g μ_B m, so H = g μ_B m B. So the energy is proportional to m, but since m is small (like 0, ±1), perhaps the energy is small.

Wait, but for Hydrogen, the orbital magnetic quantum number m can be 0, ±1, ..., up to ±l. But in the hydrogen atom, the fine structure also includes spin-orbit coupling, but perhaps the paramagnetic term is the spin part. Wait, maybe I should clarify that. Oh, wait, the paramagnetic term is due to the magnetic dipole interaction, which includes the spin as well as orbital contributions. But in this problem, perhaps we're only considering the orbital contribution, since the magnetic field is applied and the question is about the orbital m. Or maybe the paramagnetic term refers to the spin part, but I'm not entirely sure. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the paramagnetic term is the spin-orbit coupling term, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to clarify. In the context of the hydrogen atom, the Zeeman effect arises when an external magnetic field is applied, causing the splitting of spectral lines. The paramagnetic coupling term is often associated with the interaction between the electron's magnetic moment (due to spin and orbital motion) and the external magnetic field.

But perhaps in this problem, it's the orbital contribution we're considering since m is the orbital magnetic quantum number. So, the paramagnetic coupling term for the orbital part would be E = μ_B * B * m. But wait, m can be 0, ±1. So for m=0, the energy is zero. For m=±1, it would be ±μ_B * B * 1. So the energy shift is on the order of μ_B * B.

Let me compute μ_B * B. μ_B is about 9.27e-24 J/T. B is 1 T. So μ_B * B is 9.27e-24 J. How much is that in eV? Since 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J. So 9.27e-24 J is 9.27e-24 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 5.79e-5 eV. That's about 5.8e-5 eV.

Wait, but transition energy ΔE is about 2.55 eV. So the paramagnetic coupling energy is much smaller than the transition energy. So the ratio would be 5.8e-5 eV compared to 2.55 eV. So the paramagnetic term is many orders of magnitude smaller than ΔE.

So ⟨H⟩ would be the expectation value of the Hamiltonian, which in this case is the paramagnetic term. So ⟨H⟩ is about 5.8e-5 eV, which is much less than ΔE=2.55 eV.

Therefore, the correct option would be C) ⟨H⟩ ≪ ΔE.

Wait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Let me double-check the calculation.

Wait, I think I might have missed a factor. Oh wait, the paramagnetic coupling term could involve factors like the number of electrons or something else. But in hydrogen, there's only one electron, so the paramagnetic term is just μ_B * B * m.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy is μ_B * B * m, but if m is small, like m=1, then the energy is on the order of 1e-23 J, which is about 6e-5 eV. Which is indeed much less than 2.55 eV. So the paramagnetic coupling is way smaller.

So the conclusion is that ⟨H⟩ is much smaller than ΔE. So the answer should be option C.


To compare the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy ΔE of the hydrogen atom, we analyze the two quantities as follows:

1. **Transition Energy (ΔE):**  
   The wavelength of the transition is given as \( \lambda = 0.4861 \, \mu\text{m} = 486.1 \, \text{nm} \). The energy of the photon corresponding to this wavelength is calculated using the formula:  
   \[
   \Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda}
   \]  
   where \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \) (Planck's constant) and \( c = 3.00 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \) (speed of light). Substituting \( \lambda = 486.1 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{m} \), we find:  
   \[
   \Delta E \approx 2.55 \, \text{eV}.
   \]  
   This corresponds to the energy difference for the H-beta transition in the Balmer series of hydrogen.

2. **Paramagnetic Coupling Term:**  
   The paramagnetic coupling term arises from the interaction between the magnetic moment of the electron and the external magnetic field \( \vec{B} \). The energy is given by:  
   \[
   E_{\text{Zeeman}} = \mu_B \cdot B \cdot m,
   \]  
   where \( \mu_B = 9.274 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{J/T} \) (Bohr magneton) and \( B = 1 \, \text{T} \). For small values of \( m \) (e.g., \( m = 0, \pm 1 \)), the energy shift is on the order of:  
   \[
   E_{\text{Zeeman}} \approx 5.8 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{eV}.
   \]  
   This is many orders of magnitude smaller than the transition energy \( \Delta E \).

3. **Comparison:**  
   The paramagnetic coupling term \( \langle H \rangle \) is approximately \( 5.8 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{eV} \), while the transition energy \( \Delta E \) is approximately \( 2.55 \, \text{eV} \). Thus, \( \langle H \rangle \ll \Delta E \).

**Conclusion:**  
The paramagnetic coupling term is much smaller than the transition energy of the hydrogen atom. Therefore, the correct option is:

**Answer: C**
