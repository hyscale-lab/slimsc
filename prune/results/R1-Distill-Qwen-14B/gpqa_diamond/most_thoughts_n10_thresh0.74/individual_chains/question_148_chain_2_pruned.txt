Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused about where to start, but I'll try to break it down step by step. Let's read the question again and see what information I can extract.

The question is about binary compounds of fluorine with element Y. There are five such compounds. The problem describes several substances A1 through A5 and some reactions they undergo. I need to figure out the molecular weight range of A4 and choose the correct option from the given choices.

Let me list out the information given for each substance:

1. **A1**: It's a bright-red substance that decomposes at 293 K (which is room temperature, about 25°C) into A2 and fluorine. Also, A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions.

2. **A3**: This is obtained by fluorinating element Y. So A3 is probably the direct binary compound of Y and F, perhaps the most stable or common one. A3 can also interact with xenon, which might mean it's a strong oxidizing agent.

3. **A4**: When Y is added in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot, concentrated solution of A4, A5 is obtained. 

4. **A5**: In water, A5 decomposes into two substances. 

My goal is to find the molecular weight of A4. Let's think about each part.

Starting with A1: It decomposes into A2 and F2 (fluorine gas). The decomposition reaction could be something like:
A1 → A2 + F2
But the stoichiometry isn't given, so I need to think about possible reactions.

A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions. Xenon is a noble gas, but it can undergo oxidation when exposed to strong oxidizing agents. Fluorine is a strong oxidizing agent, so maybe A1 is a compound that releases F2 when it decomposes. Wait, but A1 decomposes into A2 and F2. So when A1 is heated, it produces F2 and A2.

Wait, another thought: Maybe A1 is a higher fluoride that, upon decomposition, releases F2 and forms a lower fluoride. For example, perhaps YF3 decomposes into YF2 and F2? But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe YF4 → YF3 + F2.

Wait, but let's think about the oxidation states. Fluorine usually has a -1 oxidation state. So if A1 is a binary compound of Y and F, the oxidation state of Y would depend on the formula. 

When A1 decomposes, it produces A2 and F2. So, for example, if A1 is YF3 (assuming Y is in +3 oxidation state), then decomposition might produce YF2 (Y in +2) and F2 (F in 0). So the reaction would be: 2 YF3 → 2 YF2 + F2. Let me check the stoichiometry. On the left, we have 2 Y and 6 F. On the right, 2 Y, 4 F in YF2, and 2 F in F2. So total F is 6 on each side. That works.

So, A1 could be YF3, which upon decomposition gives YF2 (A2) and F2. So the formula for A2 would be YF2. 

But wait, the oF (I think that's the oxidation state of fluorine) in A2 is given as 31.96%. Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Oh wait, I think the question says ɷF = 31,96%. I'm not exactly sure what ɷ stands for here. Maybe it's the oxidation state? Or perhaps the percentage composition by mass. Wait, no, 31.96% seems like a mass percentage. Wait, fluorine's atomic weight is about 19 g/mol. If the mass percentage of F in A2 is 31.96%, that could help find the formula.

Wait, let's think. Let's say A2 is YF2. Its molar mass would be (atomic weight of Y) + 2*(19). The
