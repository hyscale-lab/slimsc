Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. I'm a bit rusty on my relativity, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question says there are two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. I need to find the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. The options are A, B, C, D.

Hmm. So, first, relative speed. I remember that when objects are moving at significant fractions of the speed of light, you can't just subtract their speeds like you would in classical mechanics. I think you have to use the relativistic velocity addition formula.

The formula for relative velocity u' when two objects are moving at u and v relative to a common frame is (u - v)/(1 - (u*v)/(c²)). Wait, wait. Let me get the formula right. Oh right, if object A is moving at u relative to the lab frame, and object B is moving at v in the same direction, then the relative speed of A with respect to B is (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)). Or is it the other way around? No, wait, the formula is (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)), because u is the velocity of A, and v is the velocity of B in the lab frame. So when you calculate the relative velocity from B's perspective, it's u' = (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)).

Wait, no, I think I mixed up the formula. Alternatively, if you have two velocities, say u and v, both in the same direction, the relative velocity as seen by one from the other is (u - v) divided by (1 - (u v)/(c²)). So in this case, astronaut 1 is moving at 0.6c, and astronaut 2 at 0.5c. So from astronaut 2's perspective, the relative speed of astronaut 1 is (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)).

Calculating the numerator: 0.1c. Denominator: 1 - (0.3c²)/(c²) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So the relative speed is (0.1c)/0.7 ≈ 0.142857c. Hmm, so about 0.14c. Looking at the options, both C and D have v_rel around 0.14c. So the relative speed is approximately 0.14c, which would make options C and D the possible choices.

Next, the total energy of the system. Oh right, for each astronaut, their relativistic energy is given by gamma multiplied by mc², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

Wait, but the masses are 2m and 3m. So for the first astronaut: mass 2m, velocity 0.6c. The gamma factor would be 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 -0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25. So energy is gamma * m_total c². Wait, wait, no—each astronaut's energy is gamma * (their mass) * c². So for astronaut 1: 2m * gamma1 * c².

Gamma1 is 1.25 as above. So E1 = (2m) * 1.25 * c² = 2.5 m c².

Astronaut 2: mass 3m, velocity 0.5c. Gamma2 is 1/sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547.

So E2 = 3m * 1.1547 * c² ≈ 3 * 1.1547 = 3.464 m c².

Total energy E_total = E1 + E2 ≈ 2.5 + 3.464 = 5.964 m c². So approximately 5.96 mc².

Looking back at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc² and v_rel=0.14c. Option D has E=5 mc². So the correct total energy is about 5.96 mc², making option C the correct choice.

Wait, let me double-check the gamma calculations to be sure. For 0.6c: (0.6)^2 is 0.36, 1-0.36=0.64, sqrt(0.64)=0.8, so gamma is 1.25. Correct.

For 0.5c: (0.5)^2 is 0.25, 1-0.25=0.75, sqrt(0.75)= about 0.8660, so gamma is 1/0.866 ≈ 1.1547. Correct.

So E1 is 2m *1.25 c² = 2.5 mc².

E2 is 3m *1.1547 c² ≈ 3.464 mc². Sum is about 5.964 mc², which rounds to 5.96 mc². So option C is the one with E=5.96 mc² and relative speed 0.14c.

So the answer should be option C.


To solve the problem, we analyze the relative speed and total energy of the system using relativistic principles.

### Relative Speed
The relativistic velocity addition formula is used to calculate the relative speed of the two astronauts. For two objects moving at velocities \( u \) and \( v \) in the same direction, the relative velocity \( u' \) is given by:

\[
u' = \frac{u - v}{1 - \frac{uv}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \( u = 0.6c \) and \( v = 0.5c \). Substituting these values:

\[
u' = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} \approx 0.1429c \approx 0.14c
\]

Thus, the relative speed is approximately \( 0.14c \).

### Total Energy of the System
The total energy of each astronaut is calculated using the relativistic energy formula:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2 \quad \text{where} \quad \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

For the first astronaut (mass \( 2m \), velocity \( 0.6c \)):
\[
\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25
\]
\[
E_1 = \gamma_1 (2m) c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m \cdot c^2 = 2.5mc^2
\]

For the second astronaut (mass \( 3m \), velocity \( 0.5c \)):
\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]
\[
E_2 = \gamma_2 (3m) c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m \cdot c^2 \approx 3.464mc^2
\]

The total energy of the system is:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5mc^2 + 3.464mc^2 \approx 5.964mc^2 \approx 5.96mc^2
\]

### Final Answer
The relative speed is approximately \( 0.14c \), and the total energy of the system is approximately \( 5.96mc^2 \). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:
