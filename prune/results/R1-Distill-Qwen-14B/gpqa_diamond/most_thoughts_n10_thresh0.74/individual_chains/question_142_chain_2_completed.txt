Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about density matrices and their geometrical positions in qubit space. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The question gives a density matrix ρ, which is (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's in a mixed state. Pure states are represented by density matrices that are projectors (like |ψ><ψ|), and mixed states are statistical ensembles of pure states.

So looking at ρ, it's an average of two projectors: |0> and |1>. Each has a coefficient of 1/2. That makes sense because each state is equally likely. So ρ is a mixed state with equal probability of being in state |0> or |1>.

Now, the question is about the geometrical position in the qubits space. I'm trying to recall how density matrices are represented geometrically. I think in the Bloch sphere representation. For a single qubit, the Bloch sphere is a way to visualize the state.

Wait, how does this work? The Bloch sphere has pure states on the surface. But for mixed states, the density matrix is inside the sphere. The position is given by a vector r, where each component corresponds to the expectation values of the Pauli matrices.

The general form of a density matrix for a single qubit can be written as ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices and r is a vector in three-dimensional space. So if I can express the given ρ in this form, I can find r.

Given ρ = (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2. Let me expand each term. |0><0| is [[1,0],[0,0]], and |1><1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. Adding them together gives [[1,0],[0,1]], which is the identity matrix I. Then ρ = I/2. So ρ is (I + 0·σ)/2, since there's no contribution from the Pauli matrices.

Wait, that makes sense. So when ρ is I/2, the vector r must be (0,0,0). Because in the expansion, the coefficients of the Pauli matrices (which are σ_x, σ_y, σ_z) are all zero. So r_x = 0, r_y = 0, r_z = 0.

Looking back at the options:

A) (1,1,0) → No, that's not it.
B) (0,0,1) → Hmm, maybe, but wait, r is zero.
C) (0,0,0) → Yes, that's what I concluded.
D) (1,1,1) → No, that's not it.

So the correct answer should be option C, r=(0,0,0). That would mean the density matrix is at the origin of the Bloch sphere, which makes sense since it's a completely mixed state, having maximum entropy. The completely mixed state is the maximally uncertain state, which is the center of the Bloch sphere.

Wait, does this represent a state with no information? Like, if you measured it in any basis, you'd get 0 or 1 with equal probability, but no coherence. So yeah, that's the case here. So the position is at (0,0,0), which is option C.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents a mixed state with equal probability of being in the states \(|0\rangle\) or \(|1\rangle\). To determine its geometrical position in the qubit space, we use the Bloch sphere representation. For a single qubit, the density matrix can be expressed as 

\[
\rho = \frac{I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}}{2},
\]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix, \(\boldsymbol{\sigma}\) represents the Pauli matrices, and \(\mathbf{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z)\) is a vector in three-dimensional space. The components of \(\mathbf{r}\) correspond to the expectation values of the Pauli matrices.

Expanding the given \(\rho\), we find:

\[
\left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 \end{bmatrix}, \quad \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Adding these gives:

\[
\left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} = I.
\]

Thus, 

\[
\rho = \frac{I}{2}.
\]

This implies that the coefficients of the Pauli matrices \(\sigma_x\), \(\sigma_y\), and \(\sigma_z\) are all zero. Therefore, the vector \(\mathbf{r}\) is \((0, 0, 0)\). 

In the Bloch sphere representation, the state \((0, 0, 0)\) corresponds to the completely mixed state, which is at the center of the sphere. This matches the description of the given density matrix.

Analyzing the options:

- **A) \((1,1,0)\):** Incorrect, as this does not correspond to the given density matrix.
- **B) \((0,0,1)\):** Incorrect, as this would imply a different state.
- **C) \((0,0,0)\):** Correct, as derived above.
- **D) \((1,1,1)\):** Incorrect, as this does not match the given density matrix.

The correct geometrical position of the density matrix in qubit space is \((0,0,0)\).

Answer: C
