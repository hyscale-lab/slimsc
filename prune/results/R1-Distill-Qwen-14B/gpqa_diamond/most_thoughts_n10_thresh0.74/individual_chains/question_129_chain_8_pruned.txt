Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through the question carefully.

The question involves a series of reactions starting with Compound A and ending with Compound E, which we need to identify. There are hints provided, and some options to choose from.

Alright, the reaction steps are as follows:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to produce Compound B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 in the presence of Pd to form Compound C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 (nitrous acid) to form Compound D.
4. Compound D undergoes elimination of an inert gas to form Compound E.

The hints given are:

a) Compound A, when reacted with an unknown phosphorous ylide, forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane.
b) The IR spectrum of Compound A shows a strong peak around 1750 cm-1, while Compound E's IR has a peak around 1715 cm-1.

The options are A to D, each being a cyclic ketone.

Let me break this down. Starting with the IR data. The strong peak around 1750 cm-1 for Compound A suggests the presence of a carbonyl group, probably a ketone. So A is likely a ketone.

Compound E has a peak around 1715 cm-1, which is also a carbonyl but maybe a different type—perhaps an aldehyde or another ketone. Since E is the final product of elimination, maybe it's a cyclic ketone as well.

Now, looking at the reaction steps. Let me think about each transformation.

Step 1: A + HCN → B.

Hm, when a ketone reacts with HCN, it typically forms a cyanohydrin. So B would be a cyanohydrin—a compound with an alcohol (-OH) and a nitrile (-CN) group attached to the same carbon. Wait, but wait—another possibility could be addition to a carbonyl, but I think in the case of ketones, HCN adds as a nucleophile to the carbonyl carbon, giving a secondary alcohol and a cyanide group. So B is a secondary alcohol with a nitrile adjacent.

Wait, no. Wait, adding HCN to a ketone. Oh wait, I remember that HCN adds to the carbonyl to form a cyanohydrin, which is a geminal diol and nitrile. No, wait, no. Wait, no, I think when a ketone reacts with HCN, it adds to the carbonyl, giving an alcohol and a nitrile on the same carbon. So the product would be a secondary alcohol with a nitrile group adjacent. For example, if A is cyclohexanone, B would be 2-hydroxy-cyclohexane-carbonitrile, but that's not entirely accurate. Wait, no, the structure would be a cyclohexane ring with a CH(OH)CN group.

Wait, wait, maybe I should think in terms of the structure. Let me think about the reaction of cyclohexanone with HCN. The carbonyl (C=O) attacks HCN, adding H to the carbonyl O and CN to the carbonyl C. Then, the O- would have a negative charge and pick up a proton to form an alcohol. So the product would be a secondary alcohol with a nitrile group attached to the same carbon. So the structure would be something like cyclohexane with a CH(OH)CN substituent.

So Compound B is a cyanohydrin.

Step 2: B is reduced with H2 and Pd to form C.

Hydrogenation with Pd (probably under catalytic hydrogenation conditions) would typically add hydrogen across triple bonds, reduce nitriles to amines, and alcohols to alkanes. Wait, but the cyanohydrin has a nitrile group. So upon reduction with H2 and Pd, the nitrile group (CN) would be reduced. Let's think about that.

Nitriles (R-CN) upon hydrogenation can be reduced to amines (R-CH2-NH2) if using H2 and a catalyst like Raney Ni or sometimes Pd. Alternatively, sometimes it's reduced to R-CH2-CH2-NH2, but I'm not sure. Wait, no, wait: H2 and Pd would probably reduce the nitrile to an amine. So the CN group would become CH2NH2? Or maybe CH2NH2 after some steps.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the H2 and Pd reduce the nitrile to an amine. So, the nitrile (R-CN) becomes R-CH2-NH2. But I'm not entirely certain about the exact product. Alternatively, maybe the n
