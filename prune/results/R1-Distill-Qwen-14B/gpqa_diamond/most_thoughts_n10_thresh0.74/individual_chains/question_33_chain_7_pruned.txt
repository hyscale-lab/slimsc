Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about a [4+2] cycloaddition reaction. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's see if I can figure this out.

The reactants are 2,5-dimethylthiophene and furan-2,5-dione, and they're heated. The question is about identifying the exo product. Wait, exo product... right, in cycloadditions, especially Diels-Alder, the endo rule says that the more substituted product is favored, but this might be a different type of reaction. Wait, no, Diels-Alder is [4+2], but this is a [4+2] between something else.

Wait, 2,5-dimethylthiophene has two methyl groups on the 2 and 5 positions. Thiophene is a five-membered ring with a sulfur. So it's an aromatic heterocycle. Furan-2,5-dione is also a five-membered ring, but it's a dione; that is, it has two ketone groups at positions 2 and 5. So the structure is a furan (oxygen heterocycle) with two ketones opposite each other.

When these two react under heat, they undergo a [4+2] cycloaddition. Wait, but what kind of reaction is this? Well, [4+2] cycloadditions are typically Diels-Alder, but that's between a diene and a dienophile. Alternatively, the reaction could be a thermal [
