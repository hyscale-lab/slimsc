Okay, so I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to think through it step by step. Let me read the question again and break it down.

The problem is about a substance X that reacts violently with liquid Y. The reaction releases a gas W, which has a molecule where the number of neutrons equals the number of protons. Also, a precipitate G forms, and when G is heated, it releases B. The melting point of B is close to 277 K. Then there's another part about a keto acid reacting with X to produce a product with two oxygen atoms. Finally, the question is about calculating the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X, considering isotopes.

Hmm. Let me start by identifying each component.

First, looking at the reaction: X reacts with Y to produce gas W, precipitate G. When G is heated, it releases B, whose melting point is around 277 K. I remember that 277 K is approximately 4째C, which is just above the melting point of water (0째C). So B could be something that's solid at that temperature. Wait, but perhaps B is another compound. Alternatively, maybe B is a solid at normal conditions but melts near 277 K.

Wait, another thought: The melting point of water is 273 K (0째C), so 277 K is about 4째C. That's close to the melting point, but maybe B is something like ice? No, because ice melts at 273 K. Or perhaps another compound with a melting point near that. Alternatively, maybe B is some sort of oxide or another substance.

Let me think about the gas W. It says the molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. Let's denote the molecular formula of W as something where protons and neutrons are equal. For example, if the molecule is H2O, but wait: H has 1 proton, O has 8. So H2O has 2 H's (each with 1 proton, 0 neutrons) and one O (8 protons, 8 neutrons). So the total protons in the molecule are 2 + 8 = 10. The total neutrons are 0 + 8 =8. Wait, but the problem says the same number, so 10 protons and 10 neutrons? So maybe the molecule has 10 of each.

Wait, what molecule has equal protons and neutrons? Maybe something like O2? Let's see: O has atomic number 8 (so 8 protons), and neutrons would be 8 (since oxygen is usually O-16, which has 8 protons and 8 neutrons). So O2 would have 16 protons and 16 neutrons. Wait, but the question says the molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. So yes, O2 is possible. But wait, the gas released is likely a common one. Alternatively, maybe CO2? Let's see: CO2 has C (6 protons) and two O's (8 each). So total protons = 6 + 2*8 =22. Neutrons for C (assuming C-12) is 6, O-16 is 8 each. So total neutrons =6 + 2*8=22. So protons and neutrons both 22. So CO2 is a possibility. Another possibility could be H2O, but let's check: H is 1 proton each, O is 8. So H2O has 2+8=10 protons, and neutrons are 0 (H) + 8 (O) =8. Not equal. So not H2O. Alternatively, maybe NH3? Let's see: N has 7 protons, H is 1 each. So NH3 has 7 +3(1)=10 protons. Neutrons: N (assuming isotope N-14, which has 7 neutrons) and H (no neutrons). So total neutrons: 7
