Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

We have a large number of identical systems, each with a particle moving along the x-axis. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. When they measured the position, none of the particles were found at x less than 1 or greater than 3. So the particles must be confined between x=1 and x=3. The question is asking for the value of 'a'.

Hmm, right. I remember that in quantum mechanics, the wave function's square (the probability density) must be normalized. That means the integral of the absolute square of the wave function over all space must equal 1. Also, since the particles aren't found outside x=1 and x=3, the wave function must be zero outside that interval. Wait, but the wave function given here is (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So perhaps this is valid only between x=1 and x=3, and zero elsewhere?

Wait, but the wave function as given doesn't look like it's zero outside that region. So maybe I'm misunderstanding the setup. The wave function provided is valid in the region where the particle can exist, which is between 1 and 3. So perhaps this is the expression within that region, and zero elsewhere. But for normalization, I only need to integrate over where the wave function is non-zero.

Wait, but the wave function given is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. So this is a complex wave function. I think in quantum mechanics, the wave function can be complex, but when you take the absolute square, you multiply the wave function by its complex conjugate.

So the probability density is |ψ(x)|² = ψ*(x) ψ(x). Let's compute that for the given ψ.

ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) ) - 0.5i. Wait, no, the first term is a divided by square root of (1+x), and then minus 0.5i. So the entire expression is a complex number. So the complex conjugate ψ*(x) would be (a / sqrt(1+x)) + 0.5i.

So when I multiply ψ by ψ*, I get [ (a/sqrt(1+x))^2 ] + (0.5i)(-0.5i) *something? Wait, let me compute this properly.

Let me write ψ as A + B i, where A = a/sqrt(1+x), B = -0.5.

Then ψ* = A - B i.

So ψ ψ* = (A + B i)(A - B i) ) = A² + B².

So the probability density is (a²)/(1+x) + (0.5)^2.

So |ψ(x)|² = (a²)/(1 + x) + 0.25.

Wait, that can't be right. Because when you multiply it out, the cross terms would involve i terms, but when you take the real part, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me do the multiplication correctly.

ψ(x) = a/(sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5 i.

So ψ*(x) = a/(sqrt(1+x)) + 0.5 i.

Multiply them:

ψ(x) ψ*(x) = [a/(sqrt(1+x))]^2 + (a/(sqrt(1+x)))(0.5 i) - (0.5 i)(a/(sqrt(1+x))) + (0.5 i)(-0.5 i).

Wait, no, that's not the right way. Let me compute it as (A + B)(A - B), which is A² - B² when B is imaginary. Wait, because (A + iB)(A - iB) = A² + B².

Wait, because (A + iB)(A - iB) = A² - (iB)^2. Since (iB)^2 is i² B² = (-1) B². So A² - (-B²) = A² + B².

Ah, right! So in this case, A is a/(sqrt(1+x)), and B is 0.5.

So the probability density is (a²)/(1+x) + (0.5)^2.

So |ψ(x)|² = (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25.

Wait, that seems a bit odd. So the wave function is a sum of a real term and an imaginary term, and the probability density is the sum of their squares. That makes sense.

But for the wave function to be normalized, the integral of |ψ(x)|² from x=1 to x=3 must equal 1.

So the integral from x=1 to x=3 of [ (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx = 1.

Wait a second, but in quantum mechanics, the wave function must be square-integrable and normalized. So the integral should be 1. Let's compute that integral.

So let me write the integral as:

∫ (a²/(1+x) + 0.25) dx from 1 to 3.

That can be split into two integrals:

a² ∫ (1/(1 + x)) dx from 1 to 3 + 0.25 ∫ dx from 1 to 3.

Compute each part.

First integral: ∫ 1/(1+x) dx from 1 to 3.

The integral of 1/(1+x) is ln(1+x) + C.

Evaluated from 1 to 3: ln(4) - ln(2) )= ln(4/2) = ln(2).

So the first term is a² * ln(2).

Second integral: 0.25*(3 - 1) = 0.25 * 2 = 0.5.

So the total integral is a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So, a² ln(2) = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5.

Thus, a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

Compute ln(2): approximately 0.69314718056.

So 0.5 / 0.69314718056 ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

Thus, a² ≈ 0.7213 → a ≈ sqrt(0.7213).

Compute sqrt(0.7213): sqrt(0.72) is about 0.8485. Let's compute more accurately.

Wait, 0.85² = 0.7225. So 0.8485 is an approximation, but 0.85 squared is 0.7225, which is just a bit higher than 0.7213.

So a ≈ sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.8495, approximately 0.85.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.85. So the correct answer should be B.

Wait, but wait a minute. Let me check the math again. Because the wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So the modulus squared is [a²/(1+x) + (0.5)^2], as I thought.

So the integral is correct.

Wait, but another thought: wave functions are usually taken as real or have certain properties. But in this case, the wave function is complex. So the modulus squared includes both terms. So the approach is correct.

So the calculation leads to a ≈ 0.85. So the correct option is B.


To determine the value of \( a \), we start by normalizing the given wave function. The wave function is:

\[
\psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i
\]

The probability density is the modulus squared of the wave function:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \psi^*(x)\psi(x) = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25
\]

Since the particle is confined between \( x = 1 \) and \( x = 3 \), the integral of \( |\psi(x)|^2 \) over this interval must equal 1:

\[
\int_1^3 \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1
\]

This integral can be split into two parts:

\[
a^2 \int_1^3 \frac{1}{1+x} dx + 0.25 \int_1^3 dx = 1
\]

### First Integral:
\[
\int_1^3 \frac{1}{1+x} dx = \ln(1+x) \Big|_1^3 = \ln(4) - \ln(2) = \ln(2)
\]

### Second Integral:
\[
0.25 \int_1^3 dx = 0.25 \cdot (3-1) = 0.5
\]

Combining these results:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1
\]

Solving for \( a^2 \):

\[
a^2 \ln(2) = 0.5 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}
\]

Using \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \):

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7213
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
a \approx \sqrt{0.7213} \approx 0.85
\]

Thus, the value of \( a \) is approximately \( 0.85 \), which corresponds to option **B**.

Answer: B
