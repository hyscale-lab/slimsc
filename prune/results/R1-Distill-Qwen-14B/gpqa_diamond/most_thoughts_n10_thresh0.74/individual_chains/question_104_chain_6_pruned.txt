Okay, so I have this astronomy question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's start by reading the question carefully.

So, the question is about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Two stars, both with the same mass as our Sun, have each been found to have a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. The planets are in circular orbits. 

The key data given are the periodic shifts of spectral lines. Planet #1 causes a shift of up to 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2 causes a shift of 7 milliangstroms. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1.

Hmm, radial velocity method—right, that's when the Doppler shift is measured. The star moves due to the planet's gravity, and we detect the shift in its spectral lines. The shift depends on the mass of the planet and its orbital period, I think.

Wait, the formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) is something like K = (v * sin i) where v is the star's velocity. But I remember that K is also related to other parameters. Let me think—oh yeah, the formula is K = ( (G * (M_planet) ) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) ) )^(1/3) ) * (1/(1 AU)) ) * (1/(1 year)) )^(1/3)) multiplied by (1/( (1 + M_planet/M_star)^(2/3) )) )? Hmm, maybe I'm complicating it. Wait, perhaps a better approach is to recall the main formula for the RV method.

I think the main formula is K = ( (2π G) / (c T) )^(1/3) ) * (M_planet sin i) / (M_star^(2/3)), but I'm not exactly sure. Alternatively, another approach is to remember that velocity semi-amplitude K is related to the mass of the planet and the orbital period.

Wait, both stars have the same mass, and the planets have similar masses to Neptune, which is less than Earth? Wait, no, Neptune is more massive than Earth. Wait, but maybe the exact mass isn't necessary here since both planets have similar masses. So perhaps the ratio of the velocities is what matters.

Wait, the problem states that both planets have masses similar to Neptune.
