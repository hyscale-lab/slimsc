Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, I need to figure out the relationship between the orbital periods of two planets based on the shifts in their spectral lines. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that the RV method detects planets by measuring the Doppler shift in the star's spectral lines caused by the planet's gravitational pull. The star moves a little in response to the planet's orbit. So the shift in wavelength indicates the star's velocity towards or away from us.

The problem states that both stars have the same mass as our Sun, and each has a planet with mass similar to Neptune. The detected shifts are 5 milliangstroms for Planet #1 and 7 milliangstroms for Planet #2. Wait, but how does this shift relate to the planet's orbital period?

I think the RV method's measurements are related to the star's velocity. The velocity semi-amplitude (K) is the maximum speed the star moves due to the planet. The formula for K is given by:

K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) * (P)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) )^(1/1) ) ???

Wait, maybe I should look up the correct formula. Oh right, the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ (G * (M_p) * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * (1 - e^2)^(0.5) ) ) ]^(1/3) * (1 / P^(1/3) )

Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again. The formula I know is:

K = ( (2π G) / (c P) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * sqrt(1 - e²) ) )

But since the planets have masses similar to Neptune, which is much less than the Sun's mass, M_star + M_p ≈ M_star, which is the same for both stars here. So M_star is the same for both, so that part cancels out when comparing the two planets.

Also, the problem says the orbits are circular, so e=0. Then the denominator term sqrt(1 - e²) is 1, so we can ignore that.

So simplifying, K is proportional to (M_p / (M_star^(2/3) )) * (1 / P^(1/3) )

Wait, because let me get the exact formula. The correct expression is:

K = ( (2π G ) / (c P^(1/3)) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) )

Wait, no, perhaps I should think in terms of the formula that relates the velocity semi-amplitude (K) to the other parameters.

Let me try a different approach. I remember that the radial velocity semi-amplitude is given by:

K = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p) * (1 - e^2) ) ) ]^(1/3) * ( (2π ) / (P c ) )^(1/3) )

Wait, maybe that's complicating things. Let's think about the relation between K and the orbital period P. Since M_p is the same for both planets (both are Neptune-like), and M_star is the same, and e=0, then K should be inversely proportional to P^(1/3).

Wait, because K is proportional to (M_p) / [ (M_star)^(2/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) ]

But since M_p and M_star are the same for both planets, K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3).

So if K1 and K2 are the semi-amplitudes for Planet 1 and 2, then K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(
