Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, RHIC. The question is asking for the energy of the collider when the speed of the nucleus is 0.96 times the speed of light, c. The nucleus in question is X, which is defined as Lithium with 3 neutrons. Hmm, wait, Lithium usually has 3 protons. So Li-6 maybe? Because 3 protons and 3 neutrons would make it Li-6, right?

So the problem wants me to find the energy of the nucleus. I remember that when dealing with relativistic speeds, we use the gamma factor. Gamma is 1 over the square root of (1 minus v squared over c squared). So for v = 0.96c, let me compute gamma first.

Let me write down the formula for gamma: γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Plugging in v as 0.96c, so v² becomes (0.96c)^2 = 0.9216 c². So, 1 - v²/c² = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of that is sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28. So gamma is 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.5714.

Wait, wait. Let me double-check that sqrt. Because 0.28 squared is 0.0784? No, wait, wait. Wait, 0.28 squared is 0.0784? No, 0.28 * 0.28 is 0.0784. Oh wait, wait no, wait: 0.28 is the square root of 0.0784. Because sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28. Because 0.28^2 is 0.0784. Yes, that's correct. So gamma is approximately 3.5714.

Now, the energy of the particle is given by E = γ * m * c². But wait, what's the mass here? The nucleus X is Li with 3 neutrons. So Li has atomic number 3, so mass number is 3 + 3 = 6. So it's Li-6. The mass of a Li-6 nucleus.

Wait, but wait, the mass of a nucleus is not exactly the sum of the individual protons and neutrons due to binding energy. But for the purpose of this problem, I think we can approximate the mass as the mass of a Li-6 nucleus. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to use the mass of a single nucleon, but that's unclear. Wait, let me think again. The nucleus is X, which is Li with 3 neutrons—so 3 protons and 3 neutrons. So, the nucleus has a mass of 6 nucleons.

But wait, the actual mass of a Li-6 nucleus is a bit less than 6 times the mass of a proton because some mass is converted into binding energy. Hmm, but maybe for this
