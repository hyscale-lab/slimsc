Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's start by reading the question carefully.

The problem is about a substance X reacting with liquid Y. The reaction releases a gas W, which has a molecule with the same number of neutrons and protons. Also, a precipitate G forms, which upon heating releases B. The melting point of B is very close to 277 K. Another clue is that when a certain keto acid reacts with substance X, the product contains 2 atoms of oxygen. Substance X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, especially its analog.

Alright, let's break this down piece by piece.

First, I'll think about the reaction between X and Y. The fact that X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. So maybe X is an element with an isotope, perhaps something like chlorine having a heavier isotope (like Cl-35 vs Cl-37). But wait, another thought: maybe it's sodium or another element that commonly has isotopes used in such reactions.

The reaction between X and Y releases a gas W. The gas's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. Hmm. So the molecule is something where protons equal neutrons. Let's think about possible gases. Maybe CO2? No, wait. Let me thinkâ€”could it be H2O? No, H2O has 2 H and 1 O. The molecule would have the same number of neutrons and protons in each atom? Or in the whole molecule?

Wait, the question says the molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons. So for each molecule, the total protons equal the total neutrons. Let me think of possible gases like that. For example, water has 2 H (each with 1 proton, 0 neutrons) and 1 O (8 protons, 8 neutrons if it's O-16). So total protons would be 2 + 8 = 10, neutrons 8. So 10 vs 8. Not equal. So that's not it.

Another possibility: CO2. Carbon has 6 protons and 6 neutrons typically (for C-12). Oxygen has 8 protons and 8 neutrons (O-16). Each CO2 molecule has 6 + 2*8 = 22 protons, and 6 + 2*8 = 22 neutrons. Oh wait, that would make protons equals neutrons in the molecule. So CO2 is a possibility for gas W.

Wait, but CO2 is a gas, right? So when X reacts with Y, gas W is CO2. So what reaction produces CO2? Maybe a carbonate reacting with an acid? Or perhaps something like a metal reacting with an acid to produce CO2. Wait, no, metals reacting with acids typically produce H2, not CO2.

Wait, another angle. Gas W could also be CH4, but that has 6 neutrons and 4 protons in the molecule. No, that doesn't fit. Or maybe O2? O2 has 16 protons and 16 neutrons. But each O has 8 protons. So two O atoms would give 16 protons and 16 neutrons (if each is O-16). So yes, O2 would fit. But O2 is a diatomic gas, and in that case, each molecule has 16 protons (8*2) and 16 neutrons (8*2). So yes, protons equal neutrons. So gas W could be O2. But wait, O2 is O-O, so the molecule would have 16 protons and 16 neutrons in total. That fits.

Alternatively, maybe it's CO? Let me see: C has 6 protons, O has 8. So CO has 14 protons. For neutrons, assuming C is C-12 (6 neutrons) and O is O-16 (8 neutrons), so 14 neutrons. So protons 14, neutrons 1
