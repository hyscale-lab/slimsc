Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a spin-1/2 particle and how its magnetic moment oscillates when the magnetic field changes direction. Hmm, let's see. I remember that spin-1/2 particles have their spin aligned in certain directions, and the magnetic moment is related to that spin. 

The problem says the particle starts with its magnetic moment mu, which is gamma times Sz, and the magnetic field is along the +Z direction. So initially, the particle's spin is aligned with the field because that's the lowest energy state. Then, the magnetic field is turned off and another one is turned on along the +Y direction. Both fields have the same magnitude, B.

Wait, when the field is off, the particle's magnetic moment isn't experiencing any torque, right? But when the field is turned along Y, the particle's spin will start to precess around that Y-axis. I think this causes the expectation value of the z-component of the moment to oscillate over time.

I'm trying to remember about spin precession. For a spin in a magnetic field, the energy is given by the Zeeman term, which depends on the dot product of the magnetic moment and the magnetic field. When the field changes, the Hamiltonian changes, which affects the system's time evolution.

The initial state is |+z>, because the magnetic field was along Z, and the particle's moment was aligned. When the field switches to Y, the Hamiltonian becomes proportional to S_y. The new Hamiltonian would be something like H = -gamma * B * S_y, since mu is gamma S_z, but the field is along Y now.

Wait, no: the magnetic moment is mu = gamma S, so the interaction energy is mu · B. So H = - mu · B. So when B is in Y direction, H = - gamma B S_y.

In quantum mechanics, the time evolution of a state under a Hamiltonian is given by the Schrödinger equation. Since the Hamiltonian is proportional to S_y, which doesn't commute with S_z, the expectation value of S_z will change with time.

For a spin-1/2 system, the energy eigenstates of H = w S_y (where w is some constant) are |+y> and |-y>, with eigenvalues ± (w/2). But our initial state is |+z>, which is a superposition of |+y> and |-y>.

So the state will evolve in time. The time evolution operator is exp(-i H t / ħ). Substituting H, it's exp( i gamma B S_y t / ħ ). Since S_y is (ħ/2) times the Pauli matrix sigma_y, H becomes (gamma B ħ/2) sigma_y. So the exponential becomes exp( i (gamma B/2) sigma_y t ).

The energy levels are E_+ = (gamma B)/2 * (1/2) * 2? Wait, let me think. No, the eigenvalues of S_y are ± ħ/2 times some factor. Let me clarify: S_y has eigenvalues ± ħ/2. So H = - gamma B S_y, but wait no, earlier I thought H is proportional to S_y. Wait, let me re-express.

Alternatively, the Hamiltonian is H = - mu · B. Since mu is gamma S, and B is in +Y direction, H = - gamma B S_y. So H = - gamma B ( (ħ/2) sigma_y / 2 )? Wait, no. Spin operators S_x, S_y, S_z have eigenvalues ± (ħ/2). So S_y is (ħ/2) sigma_y, where sigma_y is the Pauli matrix.

So H = - gamma B ( (ħ/2) sigma_y / 2 ) ? Wait, no, I think I messed that up. Let me correct.

H = - mu · B = - gamma S · B. B is in Y direction, so B = B e_y. So H = - gamma B S_y.

Since S_y = (ħ/2) sigma_y, then H = - gamma B (ħ/2) sigma_y. So H = - (gamma B ħ / 2) sigma_y.

The time evolution is given by the time evolution operator U(t) = exp(-i H t / ħ). Plugging H in:

U(t) = exp( i (gamma B ħ / 2) sigma_y t / ħ ) ) = exp( i (gamma B t / 2) sigma_y )

But sigma_y squared is identity matrix, so the exponential can be expanded. Let's compute it.

The exponential of i theta sigma_y is cos(theta) I + i sigma_y sin(theta). Let me verify that. Because for any Pauli matrix sigma, exp(i theta sigma) = I cos(theta) + i sigma sin(theta).

So in this case, theta = (gamma B t / 2 ). So,

U(t) = cos( (gamma B t / 2 ) ) I + i sigma_y sin( (gamma B t / 2 ) )

The initial state is |+z>, which is (1, 0)^T in the sigma_z basis.

So the state at time t is U(t) |+z>.

Let me compute this:

|psi(t)> = U(t) |+z> 

But |+z> is [1; 0], and sigma_y is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So let's write U(t) as:

cos(theta) * [[1, 0],[0,1]] + i sin(theta) [[0, -i], [i, 0]]

So each term:

First term: cos(theta) I is [[cos(theta), 0], [0, cos(theta)]]

Second term: i sigma_y sin(theta) is [[0, -i^2 sin(theta)], [i^2 sin(theta), 0]]. Wait, i times sigma_y is [[0, -i^2], [i^2, 0]], but wait, sigma_y is [[0,-i],[i,0]], so i sigma_y is [[0, -i^2], [i^2, 0]], which is [[0,1], [-1,0]].

Wait, maybe I should just compute U(t) |+z> directly.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to look for the expectation value of S_z as a function of time.

The expectation value of S_z at time t is <psi(t)| S_z |psi(t)>.

Let me compute S_z. S_z is (ħ/2) sigma_z.

But perhaps let's work in units where ħ=1 for simplicity. So S_z = (1/2) sigma_z.

So let me compute <S_z>:

<psi(t)| S_z |psi(t)> = (1/2) <psi(t)| sigma_z |psi(t)>

Express |psi(t)> as U(t) |+z> = U(t) [1; 0].

Let me compute U(t) [1; 0]:

U(t) = cos(theta) I + i sigma_y sin(theta)

So U(t) [1;0] = cos(theta) [1;0] + i sigma_y sin(theta) [1;0]

sigma_y [1;0] is [0, -i; i, 0 ]^T [1;0] which is [0; i*1] = [0; i]

So U(t)[1;0] = [ cos(theta) , i sin(theta) ]^T

Wait, no. Let me compute each component.

U(t) is:

[ cos(theta) , 0 ]

[0, cos(theta) ]

plus

i sigma_y sin(theta):

i * [ [0, -i], [i, 0] ] sin(theta) = [ [0, -i^2 sin(theta) ], [i^2 sin(theta), 0 ] ].

But i^2 is -1, so this becomes [ [0, sin(theta) ], [ - sin(theta), 0 ] ].

So adding to the first term:

U(t) = [ [ cos(theta), 0 + sin(theta) ], [0 + (-sin(theta)), cos(theta) ] ]

Wait, no: the first component for U(t) is:

cos(theta) I (top left is cos(theta)) plus (i sigma_y sin(theta)) top right element is i * (-i) sin(theta) = (1) sin(theta) because i*(-i) = 1.

Wait, i sigma_y is [[0, -i^2], [i^2, 0]], which is [[0,1],[-1,0]].

So when you multiply by sin(theta), it's [[0, sin(theta)], [-sin(theta), 0]].

So U(t) is:

[ cos(theta) , sin(theta) ]

[ -sin(theta), cos(theta) ]

So when you apply U(t) to |+z> = [1, 0]^T:

U(t) |+z> = [ cos(theta) * 1 + sin(theta) *0,  -sin(theta) *1 + cos(theta)*0 ]^T = [ cos(theta), - sin(theta) ]^T.

So the state is psi(t) = [ cos(theta), - sin(theta) ]^T, where theta = (gamma B t / 2 )

Wait, theta is (gamma B t / 2 ) ?

Wait, earlier I said theta = gamma B t /2.

Yes, because theta = (gamma B t / 2 )

So the state is [ cos(theta), - sin(theta) ]^T.

Now, to find <S_z>:

S_z is (1/2) sigma_z. So sigma_z is diagonal [[1,0],[0,-1]]

So <S_z> is (1/2) [ cos(theta), - sin(theta) ]^T [1,0; 0,-1] [ cos(theta), sin(theta) ].

Wait, compute the matrix product:

Let me compute the expectation value:

<psi(t)| S_z |psi(t)> = (1/2) [ cos(theta), - sin(theta) ] [1 0; 0 -1] [ cos(theta); - sin(theta) ]

Wait, no, wait. The inner product is [a* , b* ] multiplied by the matrix multiplied by [a; b].

Wait, more precisely,

<psi(t)| S_z |psi(t)> = (1/2) [ cos(theta) , - sin(theta) ] [ [1, 0], [0, -1] ] [ cos(theta); - sin(theta) ]

So compute the matrix multiplication step by step.

First, compute the matrix times the vector:

[1 * cos(theta) + 0*(-sin(theta)), 
 0 * cos(theta) + (-1)* (-sin(theta)) ]^T = [ cos(theta), sin(theta) ]^T.

Then, take the conjugate transpose (since <psi| is the conjugate transpose of |psi> ), but in this case, all terms are real, so it's just [ cos(theta), sin(theta) ]

Wait, wait no. The state is [cos(theta), - sin(theta) ]^T. So when you take the conjugate transpose, it's [ cos(theta), - sin(theta) ].

Wait, the matrix multiplication is:

[ cos(theta) , - sin(theta) ] * [ [1 0], [0 -1] ] = [ cos(theta)*1 + (- sin(theta)) *0, cos(theta)*0 + (- sin(theta))*(-1) ]

Which gives [ cos(theta), sin(theta) ]

So the product is [ cos(theta), sin(theta) ]

Then multiply by the vector [ cos(theta); - sin(theta) ]

Wait, no. Wait, the inner product is [a, b] * [c; d] = a c + b d.

So [ cos(theta), sin(theta) ] multiplied by [ cos(theta), - sin(theta) ]^T.

Wait, no, the state after matrix multiplication is [ cos(theta), sin(theta) ]^T?

Wait I think I'm getting confused here. Let me recompute.

Wait, the state is |psi(t)> = [ cos(theta), - sin(theta) ]^T.

So when you compute <S_z> you have (1/2) times [ cos(theta) , - sin(theta) ] * sigma_z * |psi(t) >.

Wait no, S_z is (1/2) sigma_z, so the expectation value is (1/2) times [ cos(theta), - sin(theta) ] * sigma_z * [ cos(theta); - sin(theta) ]

Wait, sigma_z is diagonal [1, -
