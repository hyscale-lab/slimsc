Okay, I'm trying to solve this genetics question. Let me read through it carefully.

So, the setup is about white lupine plants and their resistance to anthracnose, a fungal disease. They found three candidate genes, G1, G2, G3. They knocked out each gene individually and made double mutants too. The results are about the resistance levels of each mutant compared to the wild type.

The goal is to figure out the interactions between these genes based on the resistance data. The options are A to D, each describing different relationships: transcription factors, epistasis, pleiotropy, gene redundancy.

Let me start by understanding what each term means.

First, transcription factors are proteins that help turn specific genes on or off by binding to nearby DNA. So a transcription factor acting upstream would regulate the expression of other genes.

Epistasis is when the effect of one gene is dependent on the presence of one or more 'modifier genes'. So gene A is epistatic to gene B if the phenotype of gene B is only visible when gene A is present. Alternatively, if the double mutant has a more severe phenotype than either single mutant, that suggests epistasis.

Pleiotropy is when a single gene affects multiple traits. But in this context, I'm not sure how that applies yet.

Gene redundancy is when two or more genes have similar functions, so knocking out one might not show a strong phenotype, but knocking out both (or more) leads to a more severe effect.

Looking at the data:

Wild type is 100% resistance.

g1: 75% → less than wild type but not completely susceptible.

g2: 0% → no resistance, so it's the most severe.

g3: 50% → so more susceptible than wild type.

Double mutants:

g1g3: 10% → very susceptible.

g2g3: 0% → same as g2.

g1g2: 0% → same as g2.

Wait, so the double mutants with g1 and g2 are as bad as g2. Hmm.

Let me think about this. If g2 is completely susceptible (0%), then perhaps G2 is a gene that's necessary for resistance. Since knocking out g2 alone makes them completely susceptible, G2 might be a key gene involved in the resistance pathway.

If G2 is a transcription factor upstream, then maybe it activates other genes, like G1 or G3.

Looking at the single mutants:

G1 knockout (g1) reduces resistance to 75%. So the plant is less resistant, but not as bad as g2 (0%).

G3 knockout (g3) reduces resistance to 50%—so worse than g1.

So maybe G2 is the most critical gene for resistance. Let's see the double mutants.

g1g2 has 0% resistance. But g2 alone is already 0%—so adding g1 knockout doesn't change the resistance. That suggests that the effect of g2 is already the extreme, so adding another mutation doesn't make it worse.

Similarly, g2g3 is 0%, same as g2. So again, the presence of g2 knockout masks any effect of g3.

The only double mutant where the resistance is different is g1g3, which is 10%. Both g1 and g3 have lower resistance than wild type when alone, but their double mutant is even worse (10% is worse than each alone). So, each single mutant is 75% and 50% respectively, but together they're 10%. That suggests that G1 and G3 are contributing to resistance independently, and their combined knockout has a much more severe effect. So maybe they function in parallel pathways.

Wait, but how does this relate to epistasis? Let's think.

Epistasis can be thought of as a hierarchy in gene function. If gene A is epistatic to gene B, then the pathway looks like A acts upstream of B. So if A is knocked out, the effect of B's knockout is masked.

Wait, no, that's not exactly right. Let's think of an example. Suppose you have two pathways: one is A → B → phenotype, and another is C → D → phenotype. If you knock out both A and C, the phenotype is more severe than either alone. But if the pathways are linear, say, A → B → C → D, then knocking out B would prevent C and D from being expressed. So in that case, the epistatic gene is A, maybe?

Alternatively, in a recessive epistasis scenario, the presence of a certain allele in one gene masks the effect of another gene. But I'm not sure that's directly relevant here.

Alternatively, when two genes function in parallel pathways, their double mutant has a more severe phenotype
