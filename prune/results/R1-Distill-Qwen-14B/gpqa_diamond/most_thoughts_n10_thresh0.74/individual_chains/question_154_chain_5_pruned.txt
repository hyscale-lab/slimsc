Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me see what it's about. Hmm, it's about identifying an unknown white solid based on spectral data. The options are four different compounds, and I need to figure out which one matches the given data.

First, let's look at the mass spec data. The molecular ion peak is at m/z 156, which is 100%, so that's the molecular weight. There's another peak at m/z 158 with 32%. Wait, mass spec can sometimes show peaks for isotopes or maybe fragments. The molecular weight is 156, so what's 158? Oh, chlorine has an atomic weight of about 35.5. Oh wait, because chlorine has two main isotopes, Cl-35 and Cl-37. So, if the molecular formula includes a Cl, the molecular ion would have peaks at different m/z depending on the isotopic composition. But wait, the molecular ion is 156, which is the exact mass. Let me calculate: 156 is the molecular weight. So maybe the formula includes Cl. Let me think about the options.

Looking at the options:

A) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. Let's calculate its molecular weight. Benzaldehyde is C7H6O. Adding a Cl (35.5) and another O from the hydroxy? Wait, 3-chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde would have the formula C7H5ClO2. So molecular weight would be (7*12) +5*1 +35.5 + (2*16) = 84 +5 +35.5 +32= 156.5. Oh, but the molecular ion is at 156. Hmm, that's a problem. Or wait, maybe I should consider exact mass. Alternatively, perhaps the molecular weight is 156, so maybe the Cl isn't part of the molecular formula. But that doesn't make sense because some options have Cl.

Wait, another approach: the molecular ion is 156, so molecular formula likely sums to that. Let me check each option's formula.

Option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Structure is Cl attached to the benzene ring at position 4, and a carboxy
