Okay, so I've got this problem about calculating the non-Gaussianity of a Schrödinger cat state using the relative entropy measure. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

First, the state is given as |psi> = (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha> ) / N. And N is the normalization constant, which is sqrt(1 + sin(2*phi)*exp(-2*alpha^2)). The parameters given are phi = -pi/4 and alpha=0.5.

Wait, the non-Gaussianity is calculated using the relative entropy measure. The formula given is del_b = trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau), where tau is a Gaussian state and rho is the non-Gaussian state's density matrix.

I remember that for pure states, the von Neumann entropy is -trace(rho ln rho). But wait, for a pure state, rho is a projector, so rho^2 = rho. So the entropy would be zero? Or wait, no, because for a pure state, the entropy is zero if it's a single state. But wait, the state here is a superposition, so it's not a product state. So when you take rho, it's the density matrix of this state. So rho is |psi><psi|.

Tau is the reference Gaussian state's density matrix. Wait, what's a Gaussian state? Oh right, Gaussian states are those whose Wigner functions are Gaussian distributions, like coherent states, squeezed states, etc. A Schrödinger cat state is a superposition of two coherent states, so it's non-Gaussian. 

So the relative entropy of non-Gaussianity would be del_b = S(rho) - S(tau), because trace(rho ln rho) is the entropy S(rho), and similarly for tau. Oh wait no, the formula is as is. So del_b is the entropy of rho minus the entropy of tau.

But wait, the problem says that tau is the reference Gaussian state. So if the state is a cat state, which is non-Gaussian, and tau is a Gaussian state, then the entropy of the non-Gaussian state minus the Gaussian reference's entropy would give the non-Gaussianity measure.

Wait, but for a pure state, the entropy is zero. Oh wait, no, wait: von Neumann entropy S(rho) is - trace(rho ln rho). For a pure state, rho is a projector, so rho
