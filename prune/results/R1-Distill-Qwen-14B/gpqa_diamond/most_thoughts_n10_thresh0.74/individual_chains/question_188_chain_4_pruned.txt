Okay, so I have this problem about a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my crystallography, but let me think through this. The question is asking about the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. The given data is the interatomic distance of 10 Angstroms, and all the angles alpha, beta, gamma are 30 degrees. 

Wait, wait. Wait a minute. Rhombohedral crystal structure. I remember that in a rhombohedral system, all the edges are of equal length, a, and all the angles between them are the same. So, the lattice parameters are a, a, a, and angles alpha, beta, gamma which are all 30 degrees here. 

The interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstroms. Wait, interatomic distance usually refers to the distance between atoms along the lattice, so that would be the edge length 'a' of the rhombohedral unit cell. So a=10 Angstroms.

Now, I need to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. Oh right, the interplanar distance d is given by the formula derived from the crystal planes. The formula I'm trying to recall is d = a/(sqrt(h² + k² + l² + ... something with the angles...)). Wait, no, more accurately, the formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is a bit different from cubic systems because of the angles.

Wait, in a cubic system, the formula is d = a / sqrt(h²
