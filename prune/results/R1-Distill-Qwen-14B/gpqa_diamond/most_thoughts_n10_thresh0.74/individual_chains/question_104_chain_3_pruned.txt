Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Let me read it again and think through what I know.

Alright, the setup is that there are two stars with the same mass as the Sun. Each has a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. The RV method detects them based on the Doppler shift of their spectral lines.

Planet #1 causes a shift of up to 5 milliangstroms, while Planet #2 causes a shift of 7 milliangstroms. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1.

Hmm. I remember that the RV method measures the velocity of the star due to the planet's orbit. The formula I think is related to the semi-amplitude of the velocity, K, which depends on the mass of the planet, the mass of the star, the inclination of the orbit, and the orbital period and distance.

Wait, the formula for the semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(1/3) ) ) )^(1/3) * ( (1) / ( (P)^(1/3) ) ) * ( ( (1) / ( (1 - e²)^(0.5) ) ) )

But since the planets have similar mass to Neptune, which is much less than the star's mass (Sun-like), M_p << M_*, so M_* + M_p ≈ M_*. So the formula simplifies a bit.

Another approximation: since both stars have the same mass (solar masses), and the planets' masses are similar, M_p is same for both. So the semi-amplitude K should depend on the orbital period.

Wait, let me get the exact formula for K. Oh right, the formula is:

K = ( (27 * pi * G) )^(1/3) * ( (M_p sin i) ) / ( (M_* + M_p) )^(2/3) ) * (1/(P^(1/3))) * ( (1 + M_p/(3 M_*)) ) )

But since M_p is much smaller than M_*, M_* + M_p ≈ M_*, and terms like M_p/(3 M_*) can be neglected. Also, the inclination i is the same for both, as they are detected (so sin i is close to 1). So I can probably ignore that.

So simplifying, K is proportional to (M_p) / (M_*^(2/3)) ) * (1 / P^(1/3)) )

Wait, no, let me write it correctly. Let me think in terms of K.

The semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( ( (G * M_p² ) / ( (M_* + M_p) ) )^(1/3) ) ) * ( (1/(2 pi)) ) * ( (1 / sqrt(1 - e²)) )

But again, since M_p << M_*, this simplifies to:

K ≈ [ (G * M_p²) / M_* ]^(1/3) * (1/(2 pi)) * (1 / sqrt(1 - e²)) )

But since the orbits are circular, e=0, so sqrt(1 - e²)=1. So K is approximately:

K ≈ ( ( G * M_p² ) / M_* )^(1/3) * (1/(2 pi))

Wait, but wait another way: another expression I've seen is K is proportional to (M_p / M_*) * (1 / (P * (1 day) )^(1/3) )

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of Kepler's third law. Because for the same star mass, the period depends on the semi-major axis.

Wait, the RV semi-amplitude K is given by the formula:

K = [ (G * M_p * sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p) )² ) * (1 / (P * (1 - e²)^(1.5)) ) ) ]^(1/3)

But since M_p << M_*, M_* + M_p ≈ M_*, so this becomes:

K ≈ [ (G * M_p) / (M_*²) ) * (1 / (P * (1 - e²)^(1.5) )) ) ]^(1/3)

Wait, maybe I should look for a more straightforward relation. Alternatively, since both stars are the same, and both planets have similar masses, the K (velocity semi-amplitude) depends on the inverse cube root of the orbital period.

Wait, no. Another approach: the RV method gives the velocity semi-amplitude as:

K = (v) = (2 pi G)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) )

Again, since M_p << M_*, M_* + M_p ~ M_*, so:

K ≈ (2 pi G)^(1/3) * (M_p) / (M_*^(2/3) * P^(1/3) )

So K is proportional to (M_p) / (M_*^(2/3) P^(1/3) )

But since M_p and M_* are the same for both planets (as per the question), the ratio of K1 and K2 should be inversely proportional to the cube root of the ratio of their periods.

Wait, because K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3).

So, K is proportional to 1 / P^(1/3). So, if K2 is larger than K1, then P2 is smaller than P1? Wait, no, wait, let me think.

Wait, the question states that Planet #1 causes a shift of 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2 causes a shift of 7. So K2 is higher than K1, by a factor of 7/5 = 1.4.

But according to the formula, K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So if K2 is larger than K1, then P2 must be smaller than P1. Because K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So if K increases, P decreases.

Wait, let me write the ratio:

K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

Because K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), so K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3) * (other factors, but they are same here)

Wait, no, let me think again. Let me write K1 = (some constant) * (1 / P1^(1/3) )

Similarly, K2 = (same constant) * (1 / P2^(1/3)
