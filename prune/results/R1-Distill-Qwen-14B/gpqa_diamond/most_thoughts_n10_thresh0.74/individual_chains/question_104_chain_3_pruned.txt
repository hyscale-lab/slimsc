Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I remember that the radial velocity (RV) method detects planets by measuring the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum as the planet's gravity causes the star to wobble. The bigger the wobble, the more massive the planet, maybe? But wait, in this problem, both planets have masses similar to Neptune, so their masses are the same. 

The question states that both stars have the same mass as the Sun, and the planets are in circular orbits. So the main difference is the Doppler shift observed—Planet #1 causes a 5 milliangstrom shift, and Planet #2 causes a 7 milliangstrom shift. I need to find how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1.

I think the Doppler shift relates to the velocity of the star due to the planet's orbit. So the formula I remember is something like velocity amplitude (K) equals ( (G * (M_planet) ) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) * (1 AU)^(1/3) ) )) ) multiplied by (1 / ( (1 year) * sqrt(1 - e²) )) ), but since the orbits are circular, e is zero, so that part drops out.

Wait, maybe a simpler approach. Because the RV method's measured velocity is related to the mass of the planet and the orbital period. Oh right, the semi-amplitude K of the star's velocity is given by the formula:

K = ( (2π G ) / (c T) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / (M_* )^(2/3)

But since both stars have the same mass (M_*) and both planets have the same mass (M_p), and assuming i (inclination) is the same (but since the shifts are periodic, I guess the inclinations are the same? Or maybe not, but the problem says they detected the shift, so sin i must be similar, probably 90 degrees, so sin i is 1 for both). So the formula for K simplifies because M_p and M_* are same for both.

So K ∝ (1 / T^(1/3)) )

Wait, let's think again. Because K is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period. So K1/K2 = (T2 / T
