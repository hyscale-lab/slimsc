Okay, so I've got this question about binary star systems and their masses. Hmm, binary stars are two stars orbiting around a common center of mass, right? And the question is about figuring out which system is more massive and by what factor.

The question says that system_1 and system_2 both exhibit eclipses. The periods are 2 years and 1 year respectively. So the orbital period for system_1 is longer. I remember that the orbital period is related to the masses of the stars and the size of the orbit. But wait, how exactly?

Then, the spectroscopic observations give radial velocity amplitudes. For system_1, the velocities are 10 km/s and 5 km/s. For system_2, they're 15 and 10. Oh right, radial velocity variations are sinusoidal because the stars are moving towards and away from us as they orbit.

I think the radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) is related to the mass of the companion. The formula I remember is something like K = (v) = (2πG / (P))^(1/3) * (M2 sin i) / ( (M1 + M2)^(2/3) )

Wait, but I might have mixed up the formula. Alternatively, another approach is that the mass function relates the velocities. The mass function for a spectroscopic binary is f(M) = (M2^3 sin^3 i)/( (M1 + M2)^2 (1 + M2/M1)^3 ) )

Wait, maybe that's getting too complicated. Another angle: in a binary system, the two stars orbit their common center of mass. The ratio of their velocities is inversely proportional to their masses. Because M1 * a1 = M2 * a2, where a is the orbital radius. So a1/a2 = M2/M1. And since velocity is proportional to orbital radius (v = 2πa / P), then v1/v2 = a1/a2 = M2/M1. So v1 = (M2/M1) * v2.

Given the velocities for each system, maybe I can find the mass ratio for each system.

In system_1, the two stars have velocities of 10 and 5 km/s. So let's say star A has velocity 10 and star B has 5. Then the mass ratio M_A / M_B should be v_B / v_A, right? Because M_A * v_A = M_B * v_B, that's from center of mass condition.

So M_A / M_B = v_B / v_A = 5 /10 = 0.5. So M_A = 0.5 M_B. So the total mass of system_1 is M_A + M_B = 0.5 M_B + M_B = 1.5 M_B.

Wait, but how does this relate to the period? Oh, right, the period is the same for both stars because they orbit each other. So for each system, the period is given, but perhaps I can find the total mass using Kepler's third law.

Wait, Kepler's third law in the case of a binary system is ( (M1 + M2) ) * P^2 = (4π²/G) * a^3, where a is the separation between
