Okay, so I've got this astronomy question to tackle. Let me read through it again and make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question says that there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times that of Star_2. Also, Star_1's mass is 1.5 times larger than Star_2's. The astronomers found that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh wait, the peak wavelength is the same for both. So I remember that the peak wavelength of a black body's emission is given by Wien's Law. Wien's Law says λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant and T is the temperature of the star.

So if their peak wavelengths are the same, that means their temperatures are the same too. Because λ_max depends directly on temperature. So both stars have the same temperature. That's a key point.

Next, the question mentions the radial velocities. Star_1's radial velocity is 0 km/s, and Star_2's is 700 km/s. Hmm, radial velocity is the component of the star's velocity along the observer's line of sight. But wait, how does that affect the observed luminosity? Oh, right, when a star is moving towards or away from us, it causes a Doppler shift in the observed wavelengths. But the question already says the peak wavelengths are the same. So maybe the Doppler shift isn't affecting the peak wavelength? Or perhaps the velocity is accounted for when they observed the wavelengths.

Wait, the problem states that the astronomers determined the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and those are the same. So despite the Doppler shift, the observed peak wavelengths are the same. But wait, is the actual temperature of the stars the same when there's a Doppler shift? Because a star moving towards us would have its light blueshifted, making the peak wavelength shorter, but if the observed peak is the same, maybe the Doppler effect is already considered in the observed wavelengths.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is implying that the intrinsic (rest) wavelengths are the same, so the Doppler shift due to velocity affects the observed. But the question says the stars' apparent brightest wavelengths are the same. Hmm. That might complicate things because if Star_2 is moving, its emitted wavelength would be shifted, but since the observed λ is the same as Star_1, perhaps the temperature is the
