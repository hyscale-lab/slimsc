Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to these concepts, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

Alright, the setup: There's a planet (let's call it Planet A) with a radius of 1 Earth radius orbiting a star that's 1.5 times the Sun's radius. Its orbital period is 3 days. Now, there's a second planet (Planet B) with a radius 2.5 Earth radii. The question is about the maximum orbital period this second planet can have while still exhibiting both transit and occultation events. Both planets have circular orbits and share the same orbital plane.

Hmm, okay. So, transit and occultation events. I remember that a transit happens when a planet passes in front of the star from our point of view, blocking some light. Occultation is when the planet passes behind the star, so the planet is eclipsed by the star, and we stop seeing its reflected light or whatever light it emits. So for both events to happen, the planet's orbit must be such that it can sometimes be in front of the star (transit) and other times behind it (occultation).

Wait, but how does the orbital period affect that? I think it has to do with the orbital distanceâ€”how close or far the planet is from the star. Because a longer orbital period usually means the planet is farther out, right? Using Kepler's third law, which relates the orbital period to the semi-major axis (distance from star) and the mass of the star.

But wait, the first planet's orbital period is 3 days. Maybe I should find out its orbital distance to get a sense of the system. Then, for the second planet, because its orbital period is longer, it must be farther out. But why is that the maximum? Because if it's too far, maybe the orbital period is so long that the alignment for both events doesn't happen in the same system's timeframe?

Wait, no. The question is about the maximum orbital period such that both transit and occultation events are possible. Oh, I think it's about the condition that the planet must pass in front and behind the star. For that, the planet's orbital distance must be such that the star's disk (as seen from the planet) is larger than the planet's disk. Otherwise, the planet would never fully eclipse the star (transit) or be eclipsed by the star (occultation).

Wait, no. That doesn't make much sense. Let me think again. For a planet to transit, the planet's apparent size must be larger than the star's apparent size from the planet's position. Wait, no, the opposite. The star must be larger in the sky than the planet as seen from Earth, but for the planet to transit, it must be able to block some of the star's light. So the planet's angular size relative to the star's must be such that it can cover part of the star when it transits.

Wait, maybe I should think about the Hill sphere or the Roche limit, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the key is about the relative sizes of the star and the planets. Wait, the problem is about whether both transit and occultation happen. So for a transit, the planet must pass in front of the star as seen from Earth. For occultation, the planet must pass behind the star, so we lose the planet's light.

But for the occultation to occur, the planet must be in the same orbital plane and the same line of sight. So for both events to happen, the planet's orbital distance must allow it to sometimes be in front and sometimes behind the star relative to our viewing angle.

Wait, but how does the orbital period affect this? I think the main point is that the orbital period determines the size of the orbit, via Kepler's third law. So perhaps the radius of the second planet must be such that, when it's in the right position, it can both transit and be occulted.

Wait, but the problem is about the maximum period. So, what's the limiting factor here? I think it's about the separation between the two planets. If the second planet is too far away, maybe the first planet's
