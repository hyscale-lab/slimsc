Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The question is about how the number of stars in a region of the sky changes with distance. The given information is that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over parallax to the fifth power, so N ∝ 1/parallax^5. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance, so I need to connect parallax with distance and then see how N changes with r, the distance.

Wait, right, parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance. The formula is plx = 1/distance, but I think it's in parsecs. So plx is in arcseconds, and distance in parsecs. So if the distance r increases, the parallax decreases. So plx = 1/r, where r is in parsecs.

So the given relation is N ∝ 1/plx^5. Let's substitute plx with 1/r. Plugging that in, 1/( (1/r) )^5. Let's compute that.

(1/(1/r))^5 is the same as (r)^5. So 1/( (1/r)^5 ) is r^5. Therefore, N is proportional to r^5. Wait, but wait, that can't be right. Let me recheck.

Wait, if N is proportional to 1/(plx^5), and plx is 1/r, then N ∝ 1/ ( (1/r)^5 ) = r^5. Oh wait, so N goes up as r^5. But wait, that can't be right because when you look at a larger volume, the number of stars should increase, but maybe the question is about the number per unit volume?

Wait, no, the question says 'per unit range of distance, r'—so it's asking about the change in the number of stars with distance, like how the number increases as you go further out. So if the number increases with r^5, that means for each unit increase in r, the number goes up a lot.

Wait, but let me think again. The number of stars in a region. If the region is a volume, the volume itself increases with r^3 (since volume is 4/3 π r^3, so proportional to r^3). But this question says the number varies with 1/plx^5, so when you look at a
