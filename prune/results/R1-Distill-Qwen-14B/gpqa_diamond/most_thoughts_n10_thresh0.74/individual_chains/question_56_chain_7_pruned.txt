Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about the hydrogen atom. Hmm, I remember that in the hydrogen atom, electrons transition between energy levels, right? The question is about a state decaying through two dipole transitions. Let me try to think this through step by step.

The initial state is |3,0,0⟩. I know that in the standard notation, |n, l, m⟩, n is the principal quantum number, l is the azimuthal or angular momentum, and m is the magnetic quantum number. So for the initial state, l is 0, which means it's an s orbital. Because s orbitals have l=0, so that's a 3s state.

The problem says it decays to |1,0,0⟩ via two dipole transitions. Wait, dipole transitions are governed by the selection rules, right? For hydrogen, the selection rules are: Δl = ±1, and Δm = 0, ±1. Oh, right, and Δn can be any, but in practice, transitions happen in steps where n changes by one. But wait, in this case, the decay goes from n=3 to n=1 in two steps. So maybe it goes 3→2→1, each time changing n by 1.

So first, the initial state is |3,0,0⟩. The first transition probably goes to a state where l=1 since l can increase or decrease by 1. So from l=0 to l=1. Now, what about m? The initial state has m=0. So during transition, m can change by 0, +1, or -1. So the possible m values after transition would be 0, +1, or -1.

Wait, but wait, the first transition is from 3,0,0 to some state in n=2, l=1, and m can be -1, 0, or +1. So possible intermediate states are |2,1,1⟩, |2,1,0⟩, or |2,1,-1⟩.

Then, from that state, the next transition goes to |1,0,0⟩. So from n=2 to n=1. Let's check the selection rules again. So l must go from 1 to 0, which is a Δl of -1, which is allowed. And m can change by 0, ±1.
