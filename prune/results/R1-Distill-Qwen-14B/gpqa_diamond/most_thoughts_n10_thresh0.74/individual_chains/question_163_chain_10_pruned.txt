Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me read it carefully.

The question is about dissolving 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm³ of solution. We need to find the minimum volume of a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid required to do this. Also, we have to find the pH of the resulting solution. The options are given as A to D.

Hmm, right. Fe(OH)3 is iron(III) hydroxide, I think. It's a weak base, isn't it? Or wait, actually, hydroxides are usually bases. So when you add a strong acid to a hydroxide, they'll react, right? The acid will donate H+ ions, and the hydroxide will donate OH- ions. They'll combine to form water.

So the reaction should be something like Fe(OH)3 reacting with HCl (a strong acid) to produce Fe^3+ ions, Cl^- ions, and water. Let me write the equation.

Fe(OH)3 + 3 HCl → FeCl3 + 3 H2O.

Wait, yeah, that's right. So each mole of Fe(OH)3 reacts with 3 moles of HCl. Because Fe(OH)3 has three OH- groups, so three H+ ions are needed per formula unit.

First, I need to find how much Fe(OH)3 we have. The mass is 0.1 grams. Let's calculate the moles. The molar mass of Fe(OH)3: Fe is about 55.85 g/mol. Each OH is 17.01 g/mol (since O is 16 and H is 1). So three OH groups would be 51.03 g/mol. So the molar mass is 55.85 + 51.03 = 106.88 g/mol.

Moles of Fe(OH)3 = mass / molar mass = 0.1 g / 106.88 g/mol ≈ 0.0009358 mol, approximately 9.358e-4 moles.

Wait, let me calculate that more accurately. 0.1 divided by 106.88. Let me do 106.88 into 0.1:

0.1 / 100 is 0.001, so 0.1 / 106.88 is a bit less. Let me compute it:

106.88 = 10688 * 1e-2. 0.1 is 100 * 1e-3. So 0.1 / 106.88 = (100 / 10688) * (1e-3 / 1e-2) = (approx 0.009355) * 0.1 = 0.0009355 mol. So about 9.355e-4 mol.

So we have 0.0009355 moles of Fe(OH)3.

Since each mole of Fe(OH)3 reacts with 3 moles of HCl, the moles of HCl needed would be 3 * 0.0009355 ≈ 0.0028065 mol.

The HCl solution is 0.1 M. So the volume needed is moles / concentration = 0.0028065 / 0.1 = 0.028065 liters, which is 28.065 cm³. So approximately 28.07 cm³ needed. So wait, looking at the options, let's see.

Option C says 28.05 cm³. That's very close. So the first part of the answer is 28.05 cm³, which is option C's volume.

Now, the second part is the pH of the resulting solution. Hmm. Let me think about this. After dissolving Fe(OH)3 in HCl, we'll have FeCl3 in solution. FeCl3 is a salt of a strong acid (HCl) and a weak base (Fe(OH)3). So the solution will be acidic because the Fe^3+ ions hydrolyze in water, making the solution acidic.

So the solution will be acidic due to the hydrolysis of Fe^3+ ions. The pH calculation involves finding the concentration of H+ ions from this hydrolysis.

First, let me find the concentration of Fe^3+ ions in the solution. The initial volume is 100 cm³, and we added 28.05 cm³ of HCl. Wait, no. Wait, the total volume after adding the acid? Or is the total solution volume 100 cm³? Hmm, the question says: "dissolve (at 25°C) 0.1 g Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm³ total volume." So the total volume is 100 cm³. So when we add the acid, the total volume may be more than 100, but the question says that the total volume is 100 cm³. Wait, no, that can't be. Wait, perhaps the process is: we dissolve the Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm³ of solution, and then add the acid. So the total volume after adding the acid would be 100 cm³ plus the volume of acid added. Hmm, but that would complicate the calculation, because the concentration would depend on the total volume. But perhaps the problem assumes that the volume change is negligible, or perhaps the 100 cm³ is the final solution volume. Hmm, perhaps the problem is that the solution after adding the acid is 100 cm³. So the total volume is 100 cm³.

Wait, the question says: "dissolve 0.1 g Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm³ total volume." Then, we add the acid. So maybe the 100 cm³ is the initial volume before adding the acid. Then, the acid is added, and the total volume becomes 100 cm³ plus the volume of acid added. But that complicates things because concentration would be a function of total volume. Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the volume change is negligible, so the final volume is approximately 100 cm³ plus the volume of acid, but that's not given. Alternatively, perhaps the 100 cm³ is the final solution after adding the acid. Hmm, not sure. Let me think.

Wait, the problem says: "0.1 g Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm3 total volume." So perhaps the solution is prepared by dissolving the Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm³ of solution. Then, adding the acid. But when you add the acid, the volume increases, but perhaps the problem treats it as the total volume remaining 100 cm³. Hmm, that doesn't make much sense. Alternatively, perhaps the 100 cm³ is the volume after adding the acid.

Alternatively, perhaps the 100 cm³ is the total solution volume after the acid is added. So the Fe(OH)3 is dissolved in a solution, and then the acid is added, making the total volume 100 cm³.

Wait, perhaps the problem is structured as: first, you dissolve the Fe(OH)3 in some solvent, and then you add the strong acid to it, making the total volume 100 cm³. So the initial solution (before adding the acid) is less than 100 cm³, and when you add the acid, you reach 100 cm³. But the problem states the total volume as 100 cm³. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe the 1
