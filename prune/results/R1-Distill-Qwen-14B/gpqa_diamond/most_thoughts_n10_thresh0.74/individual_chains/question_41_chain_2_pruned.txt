Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about light moving through a glass that's itself moving. Hmm, let me try to wrap my head around it. So the setup is that there's a glass with index of refraction n, and it's moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the light beam. The beam is going toward the observer in the lab. The question is asking for the speed of the light relative to the observer.

Wait, I remember that the speed of light in a medium is generally v = c/n, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum. Oh right, because the index of refraction tells us how much the light slows down in that medium. But wait, this glass is moving, so does that affect the observed speed?

I'm a bit confused here. Normally, velocities in physics don't just add up like in classical mechanics when dealing with light because of relativity. But wait, this is a glass moving at velocity v, which is probably way less than the speed of light, right? Because if it's a significant fraction, we'd have to consider relativistic effects, which might complicate things. But the problem doesn't mention relativity, it just says a constant velocity, so maybe we're supposed to treat it with classical mechanics?

Or wait, no. Even in classical mechanics, if the medium is moving, does it affect the speed of light in that medium? I'm a bit fuzzy on that. Let me think. In a medium at rest, light's speed is c/n. If the medium is moving, does the speed of the light as observed in the lab change?

Wait, I think the
