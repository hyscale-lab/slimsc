Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem here. Let me read it again. So, we have an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e and negligible mass. Twelve of them are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. We need to find the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimals.

Hmm, I think this has to do with electric potential energy. Because when you have charges in a system, their potential energy depends on their arrangement. Since all the charges are identical and we're looking for the minimum energy, I suppose the configuration that minimizes the potential energy would be when the charges are as close as possible to each other. But wait, wait, no, because in this case, twelve are fixed at a distance of 2 meters from point P, and the thirteenth is fixed at P. So maybe the potential energy is just the potential due to the 12 charges on the 13th one, plus their mutual potentials among themselves?

Wait, the question says it's an isolated system. So all the interactions matter. I remember that the electric potential energy of a system of point charges is the work required to assemble them, bringing each charge from infinity to their positions. And since all the charges are the same and we're dealing with identical charges, the potential energy will involve interactions between each pair.

But wait, the way the problem is set up: 12 charges are at 2 m from P, and the 13th is at P. So the 13th charge is at the center, surrounded by 12 others each 2 meters away. So I need to calculate the potential energy between each of the 12 and the central one, plus the potential energy among the 12 themselves.

Wait, but if the 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2 m from P, perhaps they form a regular dodecagon or something around P. That might mean that each of them is equally distant from each other, but wait, no, because if they're on a sphere of radius 2 m, their mutual distances depend on their positions. But maybe the problem assumes that they are all at
