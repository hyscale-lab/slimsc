Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about synthesizing a specific compound starting from benzene, and I need to choose the correct sequence of reactions from the options provided. Let's see the target molecule: 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. 

Hmm, that's a bit of a mouthful. Let me break it down. The benzene ring has three substituents: a tert-butyl group, an ethoxy group, and a nitro group. The positions are 1, 2, and 3. So, numbering the ring, the substituents are in positions 1 (ethoxy), 2 (tert-butyl), and 3 (nitro). Wait, noâ€”wait, the name is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene, so numbering starts with ethoxy as position 1. So positions 1: ethoxy, 2: tert-butyl, 3: nitro. 

So the substituents are in the 1, 2, and 3 positions. That's a meta arrangement because 1 and 3 are meta to each other, but wait, 1 and 2 are adjacent, so maybe two are ortho and one meta. Let me think. Alternatively, perhaps I should draw it out mentally. Benzene ring with substituents at positions 1, 2, 3. So the substituents are adjacent in positions 1 and 2, and then position 3 is adjacent to 2. So it's a 1,2,3-trisubstituted ring.

Wait, but that's a bit of a crowded ring. But regardless, the key is to figure out the order of substitutions to get those groups in the correct positions.

The starting material is benzene. So I'll need to perform a series of substitution reactions. The problem is about the order of adding substituents because each substitution can influence the next due to directing effects.

Let me list the substituents and their directing effects:

- tert-butyl group: that's a strong activating group, being an alkyl group. Alkyl substituents are ortho/para directors. So when adding a new substituent, it will direct incoming groups to ortho or para positions relative to itself.

- ethoxy group: this is an activating group as well. The oxygen in ether is an electron donor, so it's an ortho/para director. But wait, ethoxy is an activating group, right? Because it's an ether, not an ester or something else.

- Nitro group: that's a deactivating, meta-directing group. Because nitro groups are strong meta directors, they deactivate the ring.

But wait, the order in which these groups are added will influence where the next substituent goes. So, the strategy is to plan the order of adding these substituents so that each new group is added in the correct position relative to the existing ones.

Let me think about the target structure again. The substituents are at positions 1 (ethoxy), 2 (tert-butyl), and 3
