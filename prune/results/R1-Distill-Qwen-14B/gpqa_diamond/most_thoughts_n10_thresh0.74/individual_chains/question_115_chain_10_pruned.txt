Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

So, the problem says an electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. Another particle, a positron, is moving along the same axis but from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. They collide and annihilate, producing two photons. Both photons have the same energy, and their directions are such that one is moving upper-right and the other lower-right. I need to find the angle between their directions.

Hmm, I remember that when particles annihilate, they produce photons. Since the electron and positron are moving towards each other, their combined rest mass energy will be converted into the energy of the photons, plus their kinetic energies because they're moving at relativistic speeds.

Wait, the Lorentz factor is given. The Lorentz factor γ is equal to 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So the electron has γ=4 and the positron has γ=2.

But wait, the positron is moving from the right. So, their directions are opposite. Let me think about their momenta.

In relativity, momentum is given by p = γmv, where m is the rest mass. But since they're moving in opposite directions, their momenta will be opposite in sign.

But wait, the electron and positron have the same rest mass, right? Because a positron is just an electron with a positive charge, same mass.

So, electron's momentum: p_electron = γ_e * m_e * v_e (to the right, since it's moving from left to right)
Positron's momentum: p_positron = γ_pos * m_e * v_pos (to the left, but since it's moving from right, so let's say to the left, which would be negative in the same coordinate system.)

Wait, or maybe I should think about their velocities. The electron is moving to the right (left to right), and the positron is moving to the left (right to left). So, their velocities are in opposite directions.

Wait, but when they collide, the total momentum before annihilation should be conserved. Because in the annihilation, the photons carry away momentum, so the total momentum of the system after must equal the total before.

So, the total momentum before collision is the sum of the momenta of the electron and positron.

Let me define
