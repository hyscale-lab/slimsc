Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says that there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2, and also a mass 1.5 times larger. But wait, maybe the mass doesn't matter here since the question is about luminosity. Oh right, luminosity relates to the star's properties like radius and temperature, not mass, although mass might influence temperature in real stars, but maybe we can ignore that for this problem.

The astronomers found that the stars appear brightest at the same wavelength. Hmm, I remember that the peak wavelength of a blackbody's emission is related to its temperature via Wien's Law: lambda_max ≈ constant / T. Oh right, Wien's displacement law says lambda_max * T = b, where b is Wien's constant. So if both stars have the same lambda_max, their temperatures must be the same. Wait, no, because the question says the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. So if lambda is the same, then T must be the same, because lambda_max is inversely proportional to T. So T1 = T2.

Wait, but wait, the problem says they have the same wavelengths at which they appear brightest. So T1 = T2. That’s a key point. Because if both stars emit the same peak wavelength, they must be at the same temperature.

Now, the luminosity of a star as a black body is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4π R² σ T⁴. Where R is radius, T is temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.

So for Star_1, L1 = 4π R1² σ T1⁴. For Star_2, L2 = 4π R2² σ T2⁴.

Since T1 = T2, the ratio L1/L2 will be (R1²) / (R2²).

Because R1 is 1.5 times R2, R1 = 1.5 R2. So R1 squared is (1.5)^2 = 2.25. So L1 is 2.25 times L2. So the factor would be ~2.25, which is option A.

Wait, but that's too straightforward. Let me check if I missed anything. Oh, wait, there's also something about radial velocities. Star_1 has radial velocity 0, Star_2 has 700 km/s. How does that affect the problem?

Hmm, radial velocity relates to Doppler shift. The observed wavelength is affected by the radial velocity. But the problem states that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. So, the observed wavelengths are the same. But if the stars are moving, their emitted wavelengths would be shifted.

Wait, let me think. If a star is moving towards us, its light is blue-shifted; moving away, red-shifted. So if Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s, that would shift the observed wavelength. But the problem says that the observed wavelengths (where they appear brightest) are the same for both stars. So maybe the
