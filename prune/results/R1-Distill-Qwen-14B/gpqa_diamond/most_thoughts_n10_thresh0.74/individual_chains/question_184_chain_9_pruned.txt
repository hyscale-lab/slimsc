Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. The question is about synthesizing a specific compound starting from benzene. The target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let's break it down.

First, I need to figure out the structure of this target. The numbering is important. So, in benzene ring terms, the substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3. Position 1 has an ethoxy group, position 2 has a tert-butyl group, and position 3 has a nitro group. Wait, no, waitâ€”when numbering, the substituents get the lowest possible numbers. Let me think: if it's 2-(tert-butyl), 1-ethoxy, 3-nitro, that means the substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3. So the ethoxy is at position 1, tert-butyl at 2, nitro at 3. So the order around the ring is ethoxy (1), tert-butyl (2), nitro (3). So, the ring has three substituents in the order 1, 2, 3 clockwise or something like that.

Wait, but benzene is a ring, so the numbering could be such that the substituents are adjacent to each other. Let me draw a rough sketch in my mind. So, ethoxy is at position 1, then moving clockwise, position 2 is tert-butyl, and position 3 is nitro. So, the substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3 in a row. Alternatively, maybe they're in a meta arrangement, but no, with three substituents, it's like 1,2,3 around the ring.

Now, the key is to plan the synthesis steps. The starting material is benzene, so I need to add each substituent in the correct order, considering the directing effects of each group.

The substituents are ethoxy, tert-butyl, and nitro. Let me think about their directing effects. Nitro is a strong meta director. Ethoxy is an activating group (ortho/para), and tert-butyl (a bulky alkyl group) is an activating, ortho/para director but bulky, so it will prefer para or maybe more ortho, but being bulky, it might lead to more para substitution.

But wait, the order of adding these groups is crucial. Because each substituent directs the next one's position.

Let me think about the steps. Let's say I add the nitro group first. Nitro is a meta director. So, adding nitro first would direct the next substituents to the meta position relative to it. But in our target, the nitro is at position 3, while ethoxy is at 1 and tert-butyl at 2. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should approach this step by step.

Wait, perhaps the nitro group is added last. Because nitro is a strong deactivating group, which would deactivate the ring, making it harder to add substituents after that. So maybe it's better to add
