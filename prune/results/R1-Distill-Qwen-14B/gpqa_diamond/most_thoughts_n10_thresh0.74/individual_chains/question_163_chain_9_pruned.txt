Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to think it through. The question is about dissolving Fe(OH)3 using a strong acid and finding the minimum volume needed, as well as the pH of the resulting solution. Hmm.

Alright, let's start by jotting down what I know. Fe(OH)3 is a metal hydroxide, so it's a base. To dissolve it, we would use an acid, right? Since it's a monobasic strong acid, like HCl, I think the reaction would be something like Fe(OH)3 reacting with HCl to produce FeCl3 and water.

The chemical equation should be Fe(OH)3 + 3 HCl → FeCl3 + 3 H2O. Wait, no, because Fe(OH)3 has three OH groups, so each would react with one H+ from the acid. So the balanced equation is Fe(OH)3 + 3 HCl → FeCl3 + 3 H2O. Yeah, that makes sense.

So, the next thing is the moles. I need to find out how many moles of Fe(OH)3 are present. The given mass is 0.1 grams. What's the molar mass of Fe(OH)3? Let's calculate that. Iron (Fe) has an atomic mass of about 55.85 g/mol. Oxygen (O) is 16, and Hydrogen (H) is 1.008.

So Fe(OH)3 is Fe + 3(OH). So that's 55.85 + (3*(16 + 1.008)). Let me compute that: 55.85 + 3*(17.008) = 55.85 + 51.024 = 106.874 g/mol. So the molar mass is approximately 106.87 g/mol.

Moles of Fe(OH)3 = mass / molar mass = 0.1 g / 106.87 g/mol ≈ 0.0009359 mol. Wait, 0.1 divided by 106.87 is about 0.000936 mol. Let me double-check: 100 g would be about 0.936 moles, so 0.1 g is 0.000936. Correct.

Since the reaction is 1:3, the moles of HCl required would be 3 times that. So 3 * 0.000936 ≈ 0.002808 mol. So we need 0.002808 moles of HCl.

The concentration of HCl is 0.1 M, which is moles per liter. Wait, 0.1 M is 0.1 moles per liter, so 100 cm³ is 0.1 liters. Wait, but wait the volume given is 100 cm³ total, but the HCl is being added to it. Hmm, but wait, the volume of the resulting solution is 100 cm³. So, when you mix the HCl and the solution, the total volume might change a bit, but the problem states that the total volume is 100 cm³. So perhaps I can proceed assuming that the volume is 100 cm³.

Wait, but the question is about the minimum volume of HCl needed. Oh, wait, no: the solution is prepared by adding the HCl to some volume, perhaps, but the total volume after mixing is
