Okay, so I've got this problem here about a vector field and integrating its divergence inside a sphere. Hmm, let me think through this. I'm a bit rusty on vector calculus, but I'll try to work it out step by step.

The question says the vector field f(r) falls off radially as 1/r². So, the magnitude is f(r) = 1/r², and it's only along the radial direction in spherical coordinates. Wait, so f is a radial vector field, right? So in spherical coordinates, f(r) would have components only in the r-direction, and the others (theta and phi) would be zero.

I remember that the divergence of a vector field is a scalar, and for a radial field, there's a formula for divergence in spherical coordinates. Let me recall: the divergence of a vector field A in spherical coordinates is (1/(r²)) d/dr (r² A_r) + (1/(r sinθ)) d/dθ (A_θ sinθ) + (1/(r sinθ)) d/dφ (A_φ/(sinθ)). But in this case, A_theta and A_phi are zero, so the divergence simplifies a lot. So, ∇·f = (1/r²) d/dr (r² f_r), since the other terms are zero.

Oh wait, so f is only along r, so f_r is f(r) = 1/r², and the other components are zero. So let's compute the divergence. Plugging into the formula, ∇·f = (1/r²) d/dr (r² * (1/r²)). Let's compute what's inside the derivative: r² times 1/r² is just 1. So the derivative of 1 with respect to r is zero. So ∇·f = (1/r²) * 0 = 0. That suggests that the divergence is zero everywhere except maybe at the origin.

Wait, but wait a second. That can't be right because I remember something about point charges and Gauss's law. Like, if there's a charge at the origin, the electric field would be radial and fall off as 1/r², similar to this. In that case, the divergence would be non-zero only at the origin because of the delta function. So, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me think again. Oh wait, no, the divergence in the electric field case is zero except at the origin because of the singularity.
