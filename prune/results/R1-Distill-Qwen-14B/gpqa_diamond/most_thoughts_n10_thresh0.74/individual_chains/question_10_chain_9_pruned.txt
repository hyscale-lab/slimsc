Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and their densities. Hmm, I remember that density is mass divided by volume. But wait, how does that relate to the options given? Let me think.

The question is asking which exoplanet has the highest density. The options are a, b, c, d, and the choices are labeled A to D.

Let me look at each option one by one.

Option a: An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet. So its mass is same as Earth, and radius same too. Earth's density is about 5.5 g/cm³. So this planet's density would be same as Earth's, right? Because density is mass/volume. If both mass and radius are Earth's, then same density.

Option b: 2 Earth masses, and density approximately 5.5. Wait, density is given directly here. So this planet's density is 5.5 g/cm³. So same as Earth. So same as option a. But wait, if the mass is 2 Earth masses, but the density is also 5.5, then the radius would be different. Because density = mass/( (4/3)πr³ ). So if mass doubles, but density same, radius must be cube root of (2) times Earth's radius. But that's perhaps not relevant here. The point is, this planet's density is 5.5.

Option c: Same composition as Earth, 5 times Earth's mass. Wait, composition affects density. If same composition as Earth, which is rocky with an iron core, then the density would scale with mass? No, wait. Because the radius would increase as well. But for a given composition, the density might stay roughly the same. Because, for Earth-like planets, more massive ones have higher density? Or maybe not, because the radius increases. Wait, let me think again.

Wait, Earth's density is about 5.5. If a planet has same composition but 5 times Earth's mass, how does that affect its density? Well, if the planet is larger, its volume increases, so if mass is up and volume is up, but same composition (material), then the density would be similar. Because the same materials mean same density. So for example, if Earth's density is 5.5, then a larger planet with same composition would have same density. So the planet in option c would have the same density as Earth. So density is
