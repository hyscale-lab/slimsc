Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem about epoxidation and what happens when they run the products through HPLC columns. Hmm. Let me think this through step by step.

The question says a chemist does two reactions. Both are with mCPBA, which I remember is meta-chloroperbenzoic acid. Oh right, mCPBA is commonly used for epoxidation of alkenes. So Reaction 1 is (E)-oct-4-ene treated with mCPBA, then aqueous acid. Reaction 2 is (Z)-oct-4-ene under the same conditions.

Wait, what happens when alkenes react with mCPBA? Oh, right, it forms an epoxide. But the stereochemistry of the starting alkene affects the product. For (E) and (Z) alkenes, the epoxidation will form trans and cis epoxides, respectively. Or wait, no, I'm getting that mixed up. Let me think. mCPBA adds across the double bond in a stereospecific way. So for a trans (E) alkene, the epoxide formed would have the oxygen atoms on opposite sides, making a trans epoxide. For a cis (Z) alkene, the epoxide would also have the oxygen atoms on the same side, so a cis epoxide.

Wait, no, wait. No, wait. I think I might be confusing the two. Let me think again. When mCPBA reacts with an alkene, it adds an oxygen across the double bond. The reaction is stereospecific, so the geometry of the starting alkene affects the configuration of the epoxide.

For (E)-oct-4-ene, the substituents on each carbon of the double bond are opposite. When mCPBA adds, the oxygen will add in a way that the configuration is retained. So, if the starting alkene is E, the epoxide will be trans. For a Z alkene, the epoxide will be cis.

But wait, how does that work exactly? I think mCPBA adds to the double bond in a way that the oxygen comes from the same face. So, the peracid approaches the same face, leading to the epoxide with the same geometry as the starting alkene.

Wait, maybe I should draw this out mentally. So for (E)-oct-4-ene, the substituents (like CH2CH3 groups on either end) are on opposite sides. So when mCPBA adds, the oxygen atoms would add on opposite faces, leading to a trans epoxide.

Wait, no, maybe it's the same as the alkene. So if the alkene is E (trans), the epoxide will be trans as well. Because when the epoxide forms, the substituents (like the adjacent carbons) end up on opposite sides.

Wait, maybe another way to think: mCPBA adds an oxygen from the same face. So for (E)-oct-4-ene, the two substituents are opposite. So when the oxygen adds on the same face, the resulting epoxide would have the oxygens on adjacent carbons on the same face. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this all wrong.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think about the product. Let's say (E)-
