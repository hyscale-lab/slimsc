Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because synthesis pathways can be tricky. But let's take it step by step. The question is about synthesizing 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene. I need to pick the correct sequence of reactions from the options A to D.

First, I should probably draw the target molecule to visualize it better. The benzene ring has substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3. Let me number the ring: position 1 is ethoxy, position 2 is tert-butyl, and position 3 is nitro. So, it's a tri-substituted benzene with substituents in the 1,2,3 positions.

Wait, but substituents on benzene can direct incoming groups. I remember that activating groups like ethoxy are ortho/para directors, while deactivating groups like nitro are meta directors. Also, the tert-butyl group is a bulky alkyl group, which is an activating, ortho/para director but due to its size, it's more likely to direct incoming electrophiles to the para position if possible.

But the target has substituents at 1, 2, and 3. That's a bit unusual because having three substituents in such close proximity might require careful directing. Let me think about the order of adding these groups.

The target is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So substituents at positions 1 (ethoxy), 2 (tert-butyl), and 3 (nitro). Wait, that's like 1,2,3-trisubstituted. So, benzene has three substituents in consecutive positions.

Hmm. Let's think about the directing effects. Maybe the nitro group is introduced last because it's a strong meta director. Or perhaps it's introduced early since nitration is often an early step. Alternatively, maybe the ethoxy group is introduced in a position that allows for directing the next substituents.

Wait, the synthesis starts with benzene. Let's consider the order of adding substituents. Let's say we need to add ethoxy, tert-butyl, and nitro groups. The order matters because each step will determine the position of the next group.

But wait, benzene is symmetric, so substituents can be added in any order, but the directing will affect where the next groups go. Let's think about which substituents are activating and which are deactivating. Ethoxy is an activating group (O- is a strong activating group). Tert-butyl is also activating (alkyl group). Nitro is deactivating and meta-directing.

So, if I add the nitro group first, that would deactivating the ring, making further substitutions harder since nitro is a strong deactivator. So perhaps adding nitro last is better. Or maybe not.

Alternatively, the ethoxy group is a strong activating group, so adding it early could help in adding other groups. But wait, ethoxy is a good activating group, but it's an ortho/para director. Similarly, tert-butyl is also an
