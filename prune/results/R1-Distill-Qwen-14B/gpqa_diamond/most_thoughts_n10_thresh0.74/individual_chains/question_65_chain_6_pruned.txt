Okay, I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

The question has two parts, reactions A and B, and I need to select the correct products from the given options. So, let me look at each reaction separately.

First Reaction: 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol + THF, KH, H+ â†’ A

Hmm. I remember that when you have a spiro compound reacting with a strong base like KH (which is potassium hydride, a strong base), it might undergo some kind of elimination or ring-opening or maybe a [2+2] cycloaddition. Wait, but wait, wait. Alternatively, I think about the possibility of the spiro alcohol undergoing a pinacol-like coupling or some kind of ring-opening via an elimination.

Wait, wait. The starting material is 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol. So, a spiro compound with two rings: a 3-membered and a 5-membered ring? Or wait, spiro[3.5]non... Let me think. The spiro system connects two rings at a single atom. The numbering would be such that the spiro atom is 1. So the structure would have a three-membered ring and a five-membered ring connected at the 1 position.

Wait, the formula is 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol. So the main structure is a spiro compound where one ring is 3 carbons (since [3.5] implies the two rings are 3 and 5 carbons each, but wait, wait, the nomenclature is a bit tricky. Wait, the spiro ring numbering is such that the two rings share one atom. So, for spiro[m.n] something, m and n are the number of carbons in each ring. So, spiro[3.5] would be a 3-membered ring and a 5-membered ring connected at the bridgehead (spiro) atom.

But wait, the molecule is 1-vinyl, meaning that on the spiro atom (position 1), there's a vinyl group attached. So, the structure would have a bridgehead with a vinyl substituent.

Now, when this reacts
