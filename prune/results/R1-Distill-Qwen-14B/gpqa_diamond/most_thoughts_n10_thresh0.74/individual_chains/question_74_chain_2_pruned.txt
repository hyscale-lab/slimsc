Okay, so I've got this problem about radioactive decay, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what the question says.

The problem states that we have an atom, and we know its decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. So wait, that's the probability that it decays in 100 minutes, right? So if we have a bunch of these atoms, 32% of them would decay in 100 minutes.

But in this case, we're looking at a single atom. We've been monitoring it for 50 minutes, and it hasn't decayed yet. Now, the question is asking what's the probability that this atom will decay in the next 150 minutes. Wait, is that 150 minutes from the start, or 150 minutes from the current time?

Hmm, the way it's phrased, I think it's 150 minutes starting from now, which is after 50 minutes. So from the current time, we're looking at the next 150 minutes. So the total time from the start would be 50 + 150 = 200 minutes. But I'm not sure if that's the right approach.

Wait, but radioactive decay is a memoryless process. That means the probability of decay doesn't depend on how much time has already passed. So if the atom hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes, the probability for the next t minutes should be calculated based on the remaining time.

But wait, the given decay probability is 32% in
