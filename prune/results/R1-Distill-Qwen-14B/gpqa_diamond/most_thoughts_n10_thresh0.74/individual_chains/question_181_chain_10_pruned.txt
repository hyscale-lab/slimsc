Okay, so I've got this physics problem about neutrinos from the Sun. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step. I remember that the Sun's core is all about fusion reactions, specifically the proton-proton chain, which produces a lot of neutrinos. But wait, the question mentions something about the pp-III branch stopping. I'm a bit fuzzy on the different branches of the proton-proton chain.

So, the pp chain has a couple of branches, right? There's the pp-I and pp-II and maybe others. I think pp-III is the main branch, which involves the triple-alpha process or something... Wait, no, that's heavier elements. Oh wait, the proton-proton chain mainly produces helium from hydrogen. The pp-III branch is one of the steps, maybe involved in producing beryllium or something. Oh right, the pp-III branch probably involves the 3He that comes from the two protons fusing. So, if the pp-III branch stops, what's the implication?

Well, the problem says that the pp-III branch stopped 8.5 minutes ago. Wait, 8.5 minutes is the approximate light travel time from the Sun's core to the Earth. So, this event would take that long to reach us. But why does that matter? Oh, because neutrinos travel at nearly the speed of light, so events in the Sun's core take about that time to affect the Earth. So, the neutrinos we detect now would have been produced up to 8.5 minutes ago.

But the question is about the flux of neutrinos in two specific energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). The ratio of their fluxes is what's being asked.

So, what produces neutrinos in these energy ranges? I remember that the dominant neutrino production in the Sun is via the pp chain, specifically the pp-III branch, which involves the decay of beryllium-7 into lithium-7 and emits a neutrino. The exact process is something like proton + proton -> deuterium + positron + neutrino (pp-I), but then the main production for the higher neutrinos comes from the later stages.

Wait, the main neutrinos from the Sun are the pep (proton-electron-proton) and the pp-III neutrinos. The pep reactions are a small branch of the pp chain
