Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this organic chemistry problem. Let me start by reading it carefully.

The question involves a dicarboxylic acid that has a cis-alkene. When it's dehydrated, it forms an anhydride. The anhydride's NMR spectra are given: in 1H NMR, there's a single peak at 7 ppm, and in 13C, there are two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm. Then, this anhydride reacts with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene to give two products, major and minor, both with formula C13H16O3.

The NOESY NMR spectra show that the major product has a cross-peak, but the minor doesn't. I need to find which resonances are connected by this cross-peak in the major product.

First, I should probably figure out the structure of the starting anhydride. The 1H NMR shows a singlet at 7 ppm. That region is usually indicative of aromatic protons, but since it's a singlet, maybe it's something else. Alternatively, maybe it's an aldehyde, but no, aldehydes are usually higher, around 9-10 ppm. Another possibility is an amide, but the question is about a dicarboxylic acid anhydride. Anhydrides typically have carbonyl groups, which are around 170 ppm in 13C NMR.

Looking at the 13C NMR of the anhydride: two peaks, 137 ppm and 165 ppm. The 165 is likely a carbonyl (maybe from the anhydride's ketone groups?), but the 137 ppm is probably a sp² carbon, maybe from a double bond or an aromatic ring. Wait, but the starting material is a cis-alkene, so dehydration would form a cyclic anhydride perhaps. Let me think.

A dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene—so maybe the structure is something like HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH, but with a double bond instead. For example, HOOC-CH2-CH2-CH2-COOH wouldn't have a double bond. Wait, maybe HOOC-CH2-CH2-CH2-COOH is a straight chain, but the cis-alkene would be like HOOC-CH2-CH₂-CH₂-COOH with a double bond. Wait, maybe it's HOOC-CH2-CH2-CH2-COOH but with a double bond in the middle? No, that's a single bond. Oh wait, maybe it's HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-COOH but with a double bond between the two CH₂ groups. So, HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-COOH would be a straight chain, but if the middle two CH₂ are a double bond, that would make it HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-COOH wait, no, because with a double bond, it's HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-COOH would have single bonds. Maybe it's HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-COOH without a double bond. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, the starting material is a dicarboxylic acid with cis-alkene. So the structure is probably something like HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-COOH, but that's a single bond. Wait no, the alkene is in the chain. So perhaps it's HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-COOH, but with a double bond in the middle. So maybe HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-COOH would have a double between the two CH₂ groups. Wait, no, that's still single bonds. Wait, perhaps it's HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-COOH but with a double bond between the central carbons, so HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-COOH becomes HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-COOH, but with a double bond between the second and third CH₂ groups. Oh wait, that would make it HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-COOH but with a double between the two CH₂ groups, making it a four-carbon chain with a double bond. Wait, perhaps the structure is HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-COOH, but that's five carbons? No. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the structure is HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-COOH would have four carbons between the two COOH groups. But if the middle two are a double bond, it would be HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-COOH but with a double between the second and third
