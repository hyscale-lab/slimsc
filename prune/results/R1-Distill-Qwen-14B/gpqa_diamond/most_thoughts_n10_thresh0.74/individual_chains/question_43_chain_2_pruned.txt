Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of IUPAC nomenclature. But let me try to think through this step by step.

The question is about a benzene ring with several substituents. Let me list out all the substituents and their positions relative to each other. 

First, I remember that the benzene ring is numbered in such a way to give the substituents the lowest possible numbers. The main functional group is the carboxylic acid, which is the highest priority, so that will be position 1. 

Wait, no, wait. Wait, in IUPAC naming, the principal functional group is the one with the highest priority. Carboxylic acid has higher priority than aldehyde and cyano groups. So the carboxylic acid will be assigned to position 1.

So the carboxylic acid is at position 1. Now, the other groups are meta to each other. Hmm, the question says a carboxylic acid, a carbaldehyde (that's an aldehyde group, right?), and a cyano group are all meta to one another. So each of these three groups is at a position that's meta to the others.

Wait, but wait. If they're all meta to one another, that would be a bit tricky. Let me think. Benzene has six positions. If the carboxylic acid is at position 1, then the meta positions would be 3 and 5. Wait, no, wait. The meta positions of position 1 are 3 and 5. So, the other groups should be on positions 3 and 5, but wait, the question says all three are meta to each other. Oh, wait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting. It says the three groups are meta to one another, meaning each is meta to the others. Wait, but in benzene, three substituents can't all be mutually meta, because each would require to be at position 1 +/- 2, but that's not possible for three substituents. Hmm, maybe the problem statement is that each substituent is meta to the other two. Hmm, perhaps I should think differently.

Alternatively, perhaps each substituent is meta to the others. So, the carboxylic acid is in position 1. The aldehyde is in position 3, the cyano in position 5, but that would make them all meta
