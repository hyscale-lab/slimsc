Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about two stars and their luminosities. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.

Alright, the problem says that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Oh wait, and its mass is also 1.5 times bigger. But I don't think the mass comes into play here because the question is about luminosity, which I think depends more on radius and temperature. Oh right, because luminosity for stars is often related to their radius squared and their temperature to the fourth power, right? The formula is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. So yeah, mass might not be relevant unless it affects temperature somehow, but the problem doesn't mention that, so maybe I can ignore it.

The problem also says that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, wait, that's the peak wavelength from blackbody radiation. I remember from Wien's Law that λ_max is proportional to 1/T. So if both stars have the same peak wavelength, their temperatures must be the same. Because if λ_max is the same, then T must be the same. So T1 = T2. That’s an important point because it simplifies things.

So, if both stars have the same temperature, then the luminosity ratio will depend only on their radii. The formula for luminosity is L = 4πR²σT⁴. Since T is the same for both, the ratio L1/L2 would be (R1²)/(R2²) multiplied by (T1⁴)/(T2⁴). But since T1 = T2, that part is 1, so the ratio is just (R1/R2)².

Wait, R1 is 1.5 times R2. So R1/R2 = 1.5. Then (1.5)^2 is 2.25. So L1 would be 2.25 times L2. Hmm, but wait, that's one of the options. Option A is 2.25.

But wait, another part of the problem says the radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2. Oh, radial velocity relates to the Doppler shift, which affects the observed wavelength, right? But the peak wavelengths are the same as measured, so I think that means the observed λ_max is the same. Does that mean the intrinsic λ_max is the same, or is it after accounting for Doppler shift?

Hmm, this part might complicate things. Because if the stars are moving towards or away from us, their emitted wavelengths would be shifted. But the problem states that the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. So maybe the observed λ_max is the same. So Star_1 has radial velocity 0, so no shift. Star_2 has velocity 700 km/s. But wait, does that affect the temperature calculation?

Wait, no. Because when you observe a star, the Doppler shift affects the observed wavelength, but the actual emitted wavelength (which relates to the star's temperature) is different. So because we're using the observed λ_max to determine T, we have to correct for the Doppler shift.

Oh, right! So when you observe a star moving towards you, the wavelengths are blueshifted, meaning the observed λ is shorter than the emitted λ. Conversely, if it's moving away, the observed λ is longer. So the observed λ_max would be different from the emitted λ_max. But in this problem, the observed λ_max is the same for both stars. Wait, no, the question says the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So the observed λ_max for both stars is the same. But that doesn't necessarily mean their actual emitted λ_max is the same. Because if Star_2 is moving, its emitted λ_max could be different, but the observed would change.

Wait, that's a bit confusing. Let me think again. The problem says that the astronomers determined the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, which are the same. So the observed λ_max for both is the same. So if Star_1 is at rest (radial velocity 0), then its emitted λ_max is the same as the observed. But Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s. So the observed λ_max of Star_2 would be shifted. So if Star_2 is moving towards us, its observed λ_max would be shorter than its emitted. If moving away, longer.

But both observed λ_max are the same as each other. So what's the actual emitted λ_max of each star?

Let me model this.

Let me denote:

λ_obs1 = λ_emit1 (since v1=0)

λ_obs2 = λ_emit2 * Doppler factor.

The Doppler shift formula for wavelength is λ_obs = λ_emit * sqrt( (1 + v_r/c) / (1 - v_r/c) ) ), assuming v_r is the radial velocity. Wait, wait, actually, the relativistic Doppler shift formula is λ_obs / λ_emit = sqrt( (1 + v_r/c) / (1 - v_r/c) ) ), but if v_r is positive when moving away, negative when moving towards.

Wait, in this problem, Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s. The problem says radial velocities are 0 and 700 for Star_1 and Star_2. But it doesn't specify direction. Hmm, usually, positive velocity is away from us, negative towards. But the problem doesn't say, so perhaps it doesn't matter because we can take the absolute value.

But let's assume that Star_2 is moving towards us, so v_r is negative (since moving towards, so velocity is negative). Alternatively, maybe it's moving away. Let me think: if Star_2's radial velocity is 700 km/s, does that mean it's moving away? I think by convention, positive radial velocity is moving away. So if Star_2 is moving away, its emitted λ_max would be blueshifted or redshifted? Wait, no. If it's moving away, the light is redshifted, so the observed λ_obs would be longer than emitted. So λ_obs = λ_emit * (1 + v_r/c). But when the velocity is towards us, the observed λ is shorter.

Wait, maybe it's better to use the exact Doppler formula. The relativistic Doppler shift formula is λ_obs = λ_emit * sqrt( (1 + v_r / c) / (1 - v_r / c) ) ), where v_r is the radial velocity. But wait, that's for transverse Doppler effect? Or maybe I'm mixing this up.

Alternatively, the non-relativistic approximation for Doppler shift is λ_obs ≈ λ_emit (1 + v_r / c). So if v_r is positive (moving away), then λ_obs is longer (redshifted). If moving towards us, λ_obs is shorter (blueshifted).

But in our problem, the observed λ_max for both stars is the same. Let me call this λ_obs. So for Star_1, λ_obs = λ_emit1, because v_r1 = 0.

For Star_2, λ_obs = λ_emit2 * (1 + v_r2 / c), assuming v_r2 is positive (moving away). Alternatively, if v_r2 is negative (moving towards), then it's λ_emit2 * (1 + v_r2 / c) = λ_emit2 * (1 - |v_r2|/c) since v_r2 would be negative.

Wait, perhaps I should write it more carefully. Let me denote v as the radial velocity, with v positive for moving away. Then the Doppler shift formula for wavelength is λ_obs = λ_emit * (1 + v/c). So if the star is moving away, v is positive, so λ_obs is longer than λ_emit. If moving towards, v is negative, so (1 + v/c) would be (1 - |v|/c), making λ_obs smaller.

So in this problem, Star_1's λ_emit1 = λ_obs, because v1=0.

Star_2's λ_obs = λ_emit2 * (1 + v2/c). But both λ_obs are the same. So λ_emit1 = λ_emit2 * (1 + v2/c).

But from the problem, the observed λ_max is the same for both, so λ_obs1 = λ_obs2. So λ_emit1 = λ_emit2 * (1 + v2/c).

But from Wien's law, λ_max is inversely proportional to temperature. So λ_emit = k / T, where k is Wien's displacement constant.

So λ_emit1 = k / T1, λ_emit2 = k / T2.

But from the Doppler effect, λ_emit1 = λ_emit2 * (1 + v2/c).

Substituting the Wien expressions:

k / T1 = (k / T2) * (1 + v2/c )

Cancel k:

1/T1 = (1/T2) * (1 + v2/c )

Multiply both sides by T2*T1:

T2 = T1 (1 + v2/c )

Wait, so T2 = T1 (1 + v2/c )

But wait, I should think about the signs here. If Star_2 is moving away, then v2 is positive, and (1 + v2/c) is larger than 1. So T2 would be larger than T1. But is that possible? Or if T2 is moving towards, v2 negative, so (1 + v2/c) < 1, so T2 would be lower than T1.

Wait, but from the problem, Star_1 has a larger radius and mass than Star_2. But the temperatures, I think, can vary independently. But I'm not sure about that. Let me proceed.

Wait, no, the problem says they appear brightest at the same wavelength, but the Doppler effect might affect their observed temperatures. So maybe I need to correct the temperatures for the Doppler shift.

But perhaps I went wrong earlier. Let me try again.

The observed wavelength maximum λ_obs is the same for both stars. So for Star_1, λ_obs1 = λ_emit1 (since v1=0).

For Star_2, λ_obs2 = λ_emit2 (1 + v2/c). But since λ_obs1 = λ_obs2, then λ_emit1 = λ_emit2 (1 + v2/c).

But from Wien's law, λ_emit = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant.

So λ_emit1 = b / T1, and λ_emit2 = b / T2.

Thus:

b / T1 = (b / T2) (1 + v2/c )

Cancel b:

1 / T1 = (1 / T2) (1 + v2/c )

So, T2 = T1 (1 + v2/c )

Wait, but if Star_2 is moving away, then (1 + v2/c) is greater than 1, so T2 would be greater than T1. Alternatively, if moving towards, (1 + v2/c) would be less than 1, T2 less than T1.

But the question says that Star_1 has a mass and radius 1.5 times that of Star_2. But I don't think mass affects temperature unless we're talking about something like the main sequence, but the problem doesn't provide that.

Wait, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The problem says that the stars' luminosities are computed assuming they radiate as black bodies. So perhaps the given radial velocities affect the observed flux, but the computed luminosity would involve corrections for Doppler.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the rest-frame luminosities, meaning that when they compute luminosity, they correct for the Doppler shift. Because the Doppler effect affects the observed flux. Flux F is related to luminosity L by F = L/(4πd²), but if the star's light is Doppler shifted, the flux in a particular band would change.

But wait, the problem says they computed the luminosity assuming blackbody radiation. So perhaps the calculation already accounts for the Doppler effect. Or perhaps it's not needed, because the peak wavelengths are measured after accounting for Doppler, so the star's intrinsic temperature is the same as the other.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The wavelength at which each star appears brightest is observed to be the same. So the observed λ_max is the same. But the actual emitted λ_max depends on their temperatures. So if they have the same observed λ_max, their temperatures would be different unless their velocities are zero. So I must correct for the Doppler shift.

Wait, but the problem states that the astronomers computed the luminosity assuming they are black bodies. So perhaps the calculations already accounted for the Doppler shift in determining temperature. So when they compute L, they used the corrected temperatures.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Let me try to structure it.

1. Both stars have the same observed λ_max. So λ_obs1 = λ_obs2 = λ.

2. For Star_1, since v1=0, λ_emit1 = λ.

3. For Star_2, observed λ is λ_emit2 * Doppler factor. So λ_emit2 = λ / Doppler factor.

4. The Doppler factor depends on the velocity. Let me compute that.

Compute the Doppler factor:

v2 is 700 km/s.

But what's the speed of light in km/s? Approximately 3e5 km/s, so 300,000 km/s.

So v2 is 700 km/s, which is 700/3e5 = ~0.002333... or 0.233% the speed of light. So non-relativistic approximation can be used.

So using non-relativistic Doppler shift: λ_obs ≈ λ_emit * (1 + v_r / c )

But v_r is the radial velocity. If Star_2 is moving away, v_r is positive, so λ_emit2 = λ_obs / (1 + v_r2/c )

So (1 + v_r2/c) = 1 + (700 / 3e5) ≈ 1 + 0.002333 = 1.002333.

So λ_emit2 = λ_obs / 1.002333 ≈ λ_obs * (1 - 0.002333) approximately, using 1/(1+x) ≈ 1 - x for small x.

Wait, no, 1/(1.002333) is approximately 0.99767.

So λ_emit2 ≈ 0.99767 * λ_obs.

But for Star_1, λ_emit1 = λ_obs.

So λ_emit1 = λ_obs.

λ_emit2 = λ_obs * (1 - v_r2/c ) = λ_obs * (1 - 700/(3e5)) ≈ 0.99767 * λ_obs.

So, from Wien's law, λ_emit is inversely proportional to temperature.

So, T1 = b / λ_emit1 = b / λ_obs.

T2 = b / λ_emit2 = b / (0.99767 λ_obs ) ≈ (b / λ_obs) * (1 / 0.99767 ) ≈ T1 * 1.00233.

So T2 is about 0.233% higher than T1.

Wait, but the problem says that the luminosity is computed assuming they are black bodies. So, to compute luminosity, the formula L = 4πR²σT⁴.

Since R1 = 1.5 R2, and T2 is about 1.00233 * T1, let's compute L1 and L2.

Compute L1/L2:

L1 = 4π (1.5 R2)² σ (T1)^4.

L2 = 4π (R2)² σ (T2)^4.

So L1/L2 = ( (1.5 R2)^2 / R2^2 ) * ( T1^4 / T2^4 )

Simplify the R terms: (1.5)^2 = 2.25.

T terms: (T1 / T2)^4 = (1 / 1.00233 )^4 ≈ (0.99767 )^4.

Compute this: 0.99767^4.

Let me approximate that.

Since 1 - x ≈ e^{-x} for small x, and x is 0.00233.

So ln(0.99767) ≈ -0.00233.

So ln(0.99767^4 ) = 4 * (-0.00233) = -0.00932.

Exponentiate: e^{-0.00932} ≈ 1 - 0.00932 ≈ 0.99068.

So T term is approx 0.99068.

So L1/L2 ≈ 2.25 * 0.99068 ≈ 2.227.

Which is approximately 2.23, which is option D.

Wait, but the earlier calculation without considering the Doppler shift would have given 2.25, which is option A. But since the Doppler shift makes T2 a bit higher than T1, the T^4 term reduces the luminosity ratio compared to 2.25.

So the correct factor is approximately 2.23, which is option D.

So the answer is D.


To determine the luminosity ratio of the two stars, we start by noting that luminosity for a blackbody is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:

\[
L = 4\pi R^2 \sigma T^4
\]

where \(R\) is the radius, \(T\) is the temperature, and \(\sigma\) is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. The problem states that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2 (\(R_1 = 1.5 R_2\)) and that both stars appear brightest at the same observed wavelength (\(\lambda_{\text{obs,1}} = \lambda_{\text{obs,2}}\)).

### Step 1: Temperature Correction for Doppler Shift
The observed wavelength at which a star appears brightest is related to its emitted wavelength by the Doppler shift formula:

\[
\lambda_{\text{obs}} = \lambda_{\text{emit}} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{1 + v_r/c}{1 - v_r/c}}
\]

For small velocities (\(v_r \ll c\)), this can be approximated as:

\[
\lambda_{\text{obs}} \approx \lambda_{\text{emit}} \cdot (1 + v_r/c)
\]

For Star_1, since \(v_1 = 0\), the emitted wavelength is the same as the observed wavelength: \(\lambda_{\text{emit,1}} = \lambda_{\text{obs,1}}\).

For Star_2, with \(v_2 = 700 \, \text{km/s}\), the emitted wavelength is:

\[
\lambda_{\text{emit,2}} = \frac{\lambda_{\text{obs}}}{1 + v_2/c}
\]

Substituting \(v_2 = 700 \, \text{km/s}\) and \(c = 300,000 \, \text{km/s}\), we find:

\[
\frac{v_2}{c} = \frac{700}{300,000} \approx 0.002333
\]

Thus:

\[
\lambda_{\text{emit,2}} \approx \lambda_{\text{obs}} \cdot (1 - 0.002333) \approx 0.99767 \cdot \lambda_{\text{obs}}
\]

### Step 2: Temperature Ratio
From Wien's law, the wavelength at which a star emits most strongly is inversely proportional to its temperature:

\[
\lambda_{\text{emit}} \propto \frac{1}{T}
\]

Thus, the temperature ratio is:

\[
\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \frac{\lambda_{\text{emit,1}}}{\lambda_{\text{emit,2}}} = \frac{\lambda_{\text{obs}}}{0.99767 \cdot \lambda_{\text{obs}}} \approx \frac{1}{0.99767} \approx 1.00233
\]

### Step 3: Luminosity Ratio
The luminosity ratio is given by:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{(R_1)^2 (T_1)^4}{(R_2)^2 (T_2)^4}
\]

Substituting \(R_1 = 1.5 R_2\) and \(\frac{T_2}{T_1} \approx 1.00233\), we compute:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \left(\frac{R_1}{R_2}\right)^2 \cdot \left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4 = (1.5)^2 \cdot (0.99767)^4
\]

First, calculate \((1.5)^2 = 2.25\). Next, approximate \((0.99767)^4\). Using the approximation \(1 - x \approx e^{-x}\) for small \(x\), where \(x = 0.00233\):

\[
(0.99767)^4 \approx e^{-4 \cdot 0.00233} \approx e^{-0.00932} \approx 1 - 0.00932 \approx 0.99068
\]

Thus:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} \approx 2.25 \cdot 0.99068 \approx 2.227
\]

### Final Answer
The luminosity of Star_1 is approximately 2.23 times greater than that of Star_2. Therefore, the correct option is:
