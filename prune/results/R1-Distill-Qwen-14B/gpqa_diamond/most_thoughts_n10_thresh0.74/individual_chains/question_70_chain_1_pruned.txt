Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading through the question carefully.

The problem describes several reactions involving substances A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and H. The ultimate goal is to determine the molecular symmetry group of product E. The options given are symmetry groups like C2, D4h, D∞h, and C2v. Hmm, symmetry groups... I remember that these are related to the point groups in molecular symmetry. So I need to figure out what E is, and then determine its molecular structure to find the correct symmetry group.

Let me break down the reactions one by one.

First reaction: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. Okay, so A + 8 B → C. What could this be? I'm thinking maybe a transition metal reacting with something. Red color makes me think of maybe a transition metal compound, like copper or iron perhaps. Let's think: for example, maybe A is copper metal. If B is sulfur dioxide gas (SO2), but wait, 8 equivalents would imply a specific stoichiometry. Alternatively, maybe A is something else. Another thought: maybe A is a metal oxide reacting with another gas. Wait, another possibility: maybe A is a metal and B is a halogen. Like, for instance, aluminum reacting with chlorine gas... but that would probably form AlCl3, which is a Lewis acid but not red. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe A is iron and B is sulfur. Iron and sulfur react in a certain proportion. Wait, iron and sulfur in a 4:3 ratio might form FeS, but that's not red. Oh wait, maybe it's another reaction.

Wait, another angle: the product C reacts with gas D to produce E, which is extremely hazardous. And then C reacts with water to form A plus two acids F and G. F is strong, G is weak. So when C reacts with water, it produces A plus two acids. Let's think about that.

Wait, another thought: Maybe C is a metal sulfate. Let's say A is a metal, B is sulfur. So A could be Fe, B is S. When Fe reacts with sulfur (in a specific ratio), it forms FeS, which is black, though. Hmm, not matching the red color. Alternatively, maybe A is Cu, and B is S. Cu and S react to form Cu2S, which is black. Not red. Hmm.

Wait, what about a different approach: the product E is formed when C reacts with D. And D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent. So D + B → H. If H is a solvent, maybe something like H2O or an alcohol. Wait, but B is a gas. So for example, if B is CO2, D might be something else. Wait, let's think about another reaction where B is a gas, D is another gas or a liquid. Alternatively, B could be H2, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: think about the first reaction. 8 equivalents of gas B. So the stoichiometry is A + 8 B → C. So if A is a solid metal, then perhaps B is a diatomic gas. For example, if B is O2, but 8 O2 molecules would form something like a metal oxide with a high oxidation state. Like perhaps a transition metal oxide with a high oxygen count, like a peroxide or something else. Alternatively, perhaps B is Cl2 gas. If A is a metal, like Na, reacting with Cl2 would form NaCl, but the stoichiometry would be 2 Na + Cl2 → 2 NaCl. That's 1 equivalent, not 8. So maybe it's a different metal or different stoichiometry. Alternatively, maybe A is Fe and B is Cl2. Fe reacts with Cl2 in a certain ratio. Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Another thought: the product C when reacted with water gives back A plus two different acids. So C must be some kind of salt that, when hydrolyzed, produces two acids. For instance, maybe C is a sulfite or sulfate salt. If C is a metal sulfite, like MgSO3, then reacting with water might not produce two acids. Alternatively
