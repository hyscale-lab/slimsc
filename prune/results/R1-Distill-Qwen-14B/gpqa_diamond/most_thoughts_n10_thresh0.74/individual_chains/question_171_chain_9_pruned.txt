Okay, so I've got this question about electrophilic substitution reactions with bromine. The question involves six different substituents on a benzene ring, and I'm supposed to arrange them in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

First, I remember that in electrophilic substitution, the substituents on the benzene ring can direct the incoming electrophile to certain positions. Depending on whether the substituent is activating or deactivating, and whether it's meta or para directing, the positions where substitution occurs change.

Each of the six compounds has different substituents attached to the benzene ring. Let me list them out again:

1) C6H5-CH3: That's a methyl group attached to benzene. I think methyl is an activating group because it's an electron-donating alkyl group. Activating groups make the ring more reactive and direct incoming electrophiles to the ortho, para positions. So, substitution is more likely at ortho and para.

Wait, but for electrophilic substitution, the directing effect depends on the substituent. Methyl is activating, so yes, ortho/para directing. So the major products would be para and ortho, with para being more substituted because of less steric hindrance, perhaps? Or maybe the para is formed in a higher proportion than ortho when possible.

2) C6H5-CO-O-C2H5: That looks like an ester group, specifically ethoxy carbonyl. Wait, no, wait. Wait, C6H5-CO-O-C2H5 would be phenyl acetate? Or maybe it's an acetyloxy group attached to the benzene. Wait, the structure is benzene ring with a carbonyl (COOEt, where Et is ethyl). So the substituent is an ester group. Ester groups are meta directors, right? Because they're deactivating (electron-withdrawing) groups. So the incoming electrophile would attack at the meta position relative to the ester group. So for this compound, substitution would occur mainly meta to the ester.

Wait, but wait: the substituent is a COOEt group. COOEt is an electron-withdrawing group, so it's deactivating. That makes the ring less reactive, but since it's attached via an oxygen (like a carbonyl), it's a meta director. So the major product would be meta substitution, meaning the para isomer is not the major product? Or wait, but in this case, we're looking at the para isomer's weight fraction. So for this substituent, the para position isn't favored.

3) C6H5-Cl: That's a chlorobenzene. Chlorine is an interesting substituent. It's an electron-withdrawing group (because Cl has higher electronegativity) but in this case, chlorine is attached via a sigma bond. Wait, the inductive effect is electron-withdrawing, but the resonance effect can donate electrons if possible. Wait, no. Wait: Cl has lone pairs. When attached to benzene, can it donate electrons via resonance? Hmm, in chlorobenzene, the Cl is ortho/para directing but deactivating. Because the inductive effect is stronger than the resonance effect. So Cl is a deactivating, ortho/para director. So substitution occurs at ortho and para positions. So the para isomer would be a major product.

4) C6H5-NO2: That's nitrobenzene. Nitro is a strong deactivating group, meta-directing. So the incoming electrophile will go to the meta position. So for this compound, the para isomer isn't a major product because substitution occurs at meta positions.

5) C6H5-C2H5: That's ethylbenzene. The substituent is an ethyl group, which is an activating group (since it's an alkyl group, electron-donating via induction), so it's an ortho/para director. So substitution occurs at ortho and para positions. So para is a major product.

6) C6H5-COOH: That's benzoic acid. The substituent is a carboxylic acid group. Carboxylic acid is a strong deactivating group (electron-withdrawing), and it's meta-directing. So substitution would occur at the meta position, meaning the para isomer is not a major product.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again about each
