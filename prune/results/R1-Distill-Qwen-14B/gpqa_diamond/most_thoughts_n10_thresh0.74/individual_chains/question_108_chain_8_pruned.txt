Okay, so I'm trying to solve this multiple-choice question about the comparison between the paramagnetic coupling term and the transition energy of a hydrogen atom. Hmm, let me think. The question says the magnetic field B is parallel to Oz and is 1 Tesla. The orbital magnetic quantum number m is small, so I guess m is like 0 or 1 or something like that.

Wait, so the main point here is to compare the magnitude of the paramagnetic term in the Hamiltonian, which is the term due to the interaction with the magnetic field, with the energy difference ΔE of the hydrogen atom transition. The transition has a wavelength of 0.4861 micrometers, which I think is the Balmer series, like the H-alpha line or something. That line is about 656 nm, wait no, 0.4861 micrometers is 486.1 nm, which is blue-green, I think that's the Balmer-alpha line.

First, I need to calculate the energy difference ΔE. The energy levels of hydrogen are given by the formula E_n = -13.6 eV / n². So for the Balmer series, transitions are from n=3 to n=2. Let me compute that.

Wait, n=3 to n=2, so the energy difference ΔE = E_2 - E_3. E_2 is -13.6 /4 = -3.4 eV. E_3 is -13.6 /9 ≈ -1.511 eV. So ΔE is E_2 - E_3 = (-3.4) - (-1.511) = -1.889 eV. But since energy differences are positive, the magnitude is about 1.889 eV.

Wait, but wait, sometimes the transition energy is taken as the absolute value, so that's correct.

Now, the paramagnetic term is due to the orbital magnetic moment interacting with the magnetic field. The term in the Hamiltonian is H' = -μ·B, where μ is the magnetic moment. The magnetic moment for orbital motion is μ = (eħ)/(2m) * L, where L is the orbital angular momentum. Alternatively, the magnetic moment can be expressed using the magnetic quantum number: μ = g * μ_B * m, where g is the Landé g-factor. For the orbital contribution, g is approximately 1. So μ ≈ μ_B * m, where μ_B is the Bohr magneton.

Wait, but wait, the orbital magnetic quantum number m can be -1, 0, +1, up to l. Since the problem states m is small, perhaps m=0 or 1. Then the paramagnetic term would be proportional to m, but for m=0, the term is zero. So probably, m is 1, leading to a non-zero term.

The Bohr magneton μ_B is approximately 9.274×10^-24 J/T. So the magnetic moment is μ = μ_B * m. Then the energy due to the magnetic field is H' = -μ·B. Since B is along Oz, and the magnetic moment is in the same direction (if m is positive), the dot product would be μ*B.

Wait, actually, the energy is H' = -μ·B. If B is along Oz and μ is also along Oz, then it's just -μ_B * m * B. But I need to get the magnitude right, so the expectation value ⟨H'⟩ would be proportional to m*B*μ_B. Since m is small, maybe m=1.

So let's calculate the paramagnetic term. Let's take m=1 for maximum effect. So ⟨H'⟩ = μ_B * m * B. Plugging in the numbers: μ_B is 9.27e-24 J/T, m=1, B=1 T.

So H' = 9.27e-24 J/T * 1 * 1 T = 9.27e-24 J.

But wait, I need to compare this with the energy ΔE. The ΔE is 1.889 eV. To compare these, I should convert ΔE into joules.

1 eV is 1.602e-19 J, so ΔE is about 1.889 * 1.602e-19 J ≈ 3.03e-19 J.

Wait, but wait, H' is 9.27e-24 J and ΔE is 3e-19 J. So H' is much smaller than ΔE.

Wait, but that can't be right because in the question, the paramagnetic term is the coupling term, and ΔE is the transition energy. So if the paramagnetic term is much smaller, then the paramagnetic term's magnitude is much less than ΔE. So ⟨H'⟩ << ΔE.

Wait, but
