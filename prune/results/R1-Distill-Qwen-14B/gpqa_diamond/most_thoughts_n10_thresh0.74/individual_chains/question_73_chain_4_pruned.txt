Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

So the problem states: two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m are moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. I need to find the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

Wait, relative speed in relativity isn't just a simple subtraction like in classical mechanics, right? Because when objects are moving at significant fractions of the speed of light, you can't just do a simple velocity addition. Oh right, you use the velocity addition formula from special relativity.

The formula is (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/c²), I think. Wait, no, that's when you have two frames. Wait, no, wait, the relative velocity formula. Let me get that straight. If object A is moving at u relative to the lab frame, and object B is moving at v in the same frame, then the relative velocity of A with respect to B would be (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)). But wait, I'm a bit confused. Because both are moving in the same direction, so the relative speed is (u - v) in the numerator.

Wait, but wait, wait. Let me think again. Object A is moving at u (0.6c) and object B at v (0.5c), both same direction. So in the lab frame, A is faster than B. So from A's frame, what's B's speed? Wait, no, the relative speed would be how fast B is moving relative to A, but since they're moving in the same direction, I think it's (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)).

Wait, let me make sure. The formula when you have two velocities, like in one frame, another frame moving at velocity u, and an object moving at v in that frame. The velocity in the lab frame is (u + v)/(1 + (u v)/c²), but that's when they are adding. But here, I think the relative velocity is (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/c²). Hmm, but wait, perhaps I'm mixing it up.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the relative speed as (v_A - v_B)/(1 - (v_A v_B)/c²). Since
