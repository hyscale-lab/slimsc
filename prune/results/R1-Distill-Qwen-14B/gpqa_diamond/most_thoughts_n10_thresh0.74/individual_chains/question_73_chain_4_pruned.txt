Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I'm supposed to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, relativistic speeds, so I definitely need to use special relativity formulas here. Let me think about what I remember from my studies.

The problem states that astronaut A has a mass of 2m and is moving at 0.6c, while astronaut B has a mass of 3m and is moving at 0.5c, both in the positive x-direction. Wait, but when we talk about relative speed between two objects moving in the same direction, I think we don't just subtract their speeds normally because they're moving at significant fractions of the speed of light. So I need to use the relativistic velocity addition formula.

Oh right, the formula for relative speed (v_rel) when two objects are moving in the same direction is (u - v)/(1 - (u*v)/c²). Wait, no, wait. Let me get the formula right. Oh, right, if one object is moving at speed u relative to another, which is moving at speed v relative to the observer, then the relative speed u' is (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)).

So in this case, both are moving in the same direction. Let me get their speeds right. So astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, and astronaut B at 0.5c. Wait, but wait—wait, when considering the relative speed of B as seen from A, or vice versa? Wait, the question says "relative speed" generally. Oh, but both are moving in the same direction, so relative speed would be the difference, but adjusted for relativity.

Wait, no, for relative velocity, if A is moving at u = 0.6c in the positive x-direction, and B is moving at v = 0.5c in the positive x-direction, then from A's frame, what is B's speed? Because B is moving slower than A. So from A's perspective, B is moving at (v - u)/(1 - (v u)/c²). Let me plug the numbers. So v here is 0.5c, u is 0.6c.

So (0.5c - 0.6c) / (1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/(c²)) )? Wait, that would be (-0.1
