Okay, so I've got this question about molecular symmetry, and I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is asking which of the given molecules has C3h symmetry. The options are A, B, C, D, each being a different compound.

First, I need to recall what C3h symmetry means. C3h is a point group in molecular symmetry. Point groups are categories that describe the symmetry of molecules. The 'C3h' notation comes from the classification system where the letter denotes the type of symmetry element present. 

C3h is a subgroup of the dihedral groups. Wait, no, the dihedral groups are more about the symmetry elements like Cn and σ. Let me think. The point group C3h includes a three-fold rotation axis (C3), a horizontal mirror plane (σh), and the combination of these leads to other symmetry elements like inversion, etc. So, for a molecule to have C3h symmetry, it must have a three-fold rotation axis, and a horizontal mirror plane. Alternatively, perhaps C3h is equivalent to the dihedral group D3h.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. C3h is a term sometimes used in older notations. In the newer notation, the dihedral group D3h would correspond to C3h. So D3h has a C3 axis, a σh plane, and other planes. Alternatively, the notation might differ, but the key is to look for a three-fold rotation and a horizontal mirror. 

So, the molecule must have a three-fold axis and a mirror plane that's horizontal. So, I need to look at each option's structure and see which has this.

Option C is triisopropyl borate. I think triisopropyl borate has the structure where boron is at the center, connected to three isopropyl groups. Each isopropyl group is a substituent. So, the structure is similar to BF3 but with isopropyl groups. Wait, BF3 is trigonal planar, but triisopropyl borate, being a borate, might have a trigonal planar geometry as well. So, if the three substituents are all the same (all isopropyl), then the molecule would have a three-fold rotation axis (C3). But
