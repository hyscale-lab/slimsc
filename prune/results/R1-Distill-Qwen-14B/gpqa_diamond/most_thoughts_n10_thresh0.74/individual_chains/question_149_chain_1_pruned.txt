Okay, so I've got this NMR and LC-MS question here, and I'm a bit confused, but let me try to think through it step by step.

Alright, the question is about a small peptidic compound that's been synthesized. The 1H NMR spectrum looks mostly correct except for two peaks from the same alpha-proton. These two peaks have similar chemical shifts and their integrals add up to 1H. So, each is about half the height. Also, the coupling pattern rules out spin-spin coupling as the reason. Hmm, so what else could cause two peaks for the same proton?

Then, looking at the LC-MS analysis: when run at elevated temperature, there are two peaks of equal intensity. Both have the same mass spectrum as the expected compound. So, same molecular weight, same structure? But two separate peaks. So, they're not fragments because the mass is the same as the target.

What could cause two peaks in LC-MS with the same mass? Maybe the compound is a mixture of isomers that have the same molecular weight but different structures. But wait, the NMR shows something else.

In the NMR, the doublet for the same alpha proton suggests maybe there's some kind of splitting. But they said spin-spin coupling is ruled out. So, what else could cause two peaks? Maybe something to do with the structure of the molecule when it's in the NMR environment. Or perhaps it's related to the compound's stereochemistry.

Wait, the options are A to D. Let's think about each.

Option A: Contaminated with a precursor. The LC-MS would probably show the precursor's mass, which would be higher, right? Because the precursor is the starting material before the reaction. But in the question, both peaks have the same mass as the expected, so this might not fit. Plus, the NMR would look different if it were another compound. So probably not A.

Option B: Mixture of enantiomers. Enantiomers are mirror images, so they have the same molecular weight and same NMR shifts. Wait, but in NMR, if they are enantiomers, wouldn't each enantiomer's protons have the same shift, leading to a single peak? Unless... wait, no. Enantiomers have identical 1H NMR spectra because the environment is the same. So if you have a racemic mixture, you wouldn't see two separate peaks for each proton, because the shifts are the same. So the NMR wouldn't show two peaks for the same proton. So B might not explain the NMR issue. Unless something else is going on, but I think B is probably not the answer.

Option C: 'Double coupling' during amide bond formation. Hmm. I'm a bit fuzzy on this. Double coupling could refer to when a proton is coupled to two different sets of equivalent nuclei, like in some splitting situations. But I'm not sure how that would cause two peaks for the same alpha proton. Alternatively, maybe it's a case of an amide proton being split due to some other coupling, but the question says the coupling pattern rules that out. So maybe C isn't the right choice.

Option D: Mixture of diastereoisomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties, including NMR shifts. So each diastereomer might have a slightly different environment for the alpha-proton, causing different chemical shifts. Wait, but the question says the two peaks have similar chemical shifts. Oh, but diastereomers can sometimes have very similar shifts, especially if the difference is subtle, like in diastereotopic protons or something. Alternatively, maybe there's some other factor.

Wait, the NMR shows two peaks for the same alpha-proton. So, in the structure, the alpha proton is in the same environment in both cases? Or perhaps the diastereomers have the same shift for that proton. Hmm, but in that case, maybe the integral would
