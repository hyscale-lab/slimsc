Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. The question is about the uncertainty principle, right? I remember that the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle deals with the uncertainty in position and momentum. And from there, you can find the uncertainty in energy. Hmm.

Alright, the problem states that an electron is traveling at a speed v of 2e8 m/s along the x-direction, and the uncertainty in its location, Δx, is 0.1 nanometers. I need to find the minimum uncertainty in energy ΔE. The options are A to D, each with different magnitudes.

First, I think I should recall the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. Oh right, the formula is Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. Since we're looking for the minimum uncertainty, I'll consider the equality Δx * Δp = ħ/2. That makes sense because the minimum uncertainty occurs when the product is exactly equal to ħ over two.

So, I need to find Δp first, the uncertainty in momentum. Momentum p is mass times velocity, but wait, here we're dealing with the uncertainty. Oh wait, no, the uncertainty in momentum Δp is related to the uncertainty in position. Right.

Given Δx is 0.1 nm. Let me convert that to meters. 0.1 nm is 0.1e-9 meters, so 1e-10 meters. Okay.

Now, the reduced Planck constant ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s. So, solving for Δp: Δp = ħ/(2Δx). Plugging in the numbers.

Wait, let me do that calculation. So ħ is about 1e-34 J·s, and 2Δx is 2 * 1e-10 m = 2e-10 m. So Δp ≈ (1e-34) / (2e-10) ) → 0.5e-24 kg·m/s.

Wait, wait. Wait a second. Let me calculate it more accurately. Let's write it as (1.0545718e-34) / (2 * 1e-10) ) → 1.05e-34 / 2e-10 = (1.05 / 2) * 1e-24. So 0.525e-24 kg m/s, or 5.25e-25 kg·m/s.

But wait, that's the uncertainty in momentum. Now, how does that relate to the uncertainty in energy ΔE?

Hmm, I think I need to consider the relation between energy and momentum. For a particle moving at non-relativistic speeds, the kinetic energy E is (p²)/(2m), where m is the mass of the electron. Since we're dealing with uncertainties, ΔE is the uncertainty in this energy.

So, let's compute ΔE. But wait, because we're dealing with uncertainties, I think I should use the formula for the uncertainty in energy due to the uncertainty in momentum. Since E = p²/(2m), the uncertainty in E would be related to the uncertainty in p.

Alternatively, using the uncertainty principle again, perhaps I can find the minimum uncertainty in energy based on the momentum uncertainty. Wait, maybe I should use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time? But in this case, the question gives a position uncertainty, so I think the first approach is correct.

But let me think again. The kinetic energy is given by E = p²/(2m). So the uncertainty in E would be the derivative of E with respect to p multiplied by the uncertainty in p, right? Because ΔE ≈ |dE/dp| * Δp.

Wait, that's the formula for error propagation. So, let's compute dE/dp. The derivative of (p²)/(2m) with respect to p is p/m. So ΔE ≈ (p/m) * Δp.

Wait, but wait.
