Okay, so I have this question about two planets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, let me try to break it down. The question gives a lot of data, so I need to figure out what's relevant.

First, the star has a mass of 1.5 solar masses, radius 1.2 solar radii, and effective temperature 6300 K. The two planets, Planet1 and Planet2, have different masses and radii. Planet1 is 7 Earth masses with a radius 1.7 Earth radii, and Planet2 is 5 Earth masses with 1.3 Earth radii. Both orbits are circular.

The question is about the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures. Oh right, equilibrium temperature depends on a few factors. The main formula I remember is the one for a planet's equilibrium temperature, which is:

Te = T_star * sqrt(R_star / (2a)) ) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4) 

Wait, but wait. The albedo is the same for both planets, so that term will cancel out when taking the ratio. So I don't need to worry about albedo in this case.

So the key factors here are the star's temperature, the planet's distance from the star (a), and the star's radius. Because all the planets in a system orbit the same star, the star's Teff and R are the same for both planets. So the only difference comes from the orbital distance a.

But wait, how do we find the orbital distance? The question provides data from the transit and radial velocity methods. Specifically, the shifts in forbidden lines. Oh, right, the radial velocity method measures the Doppler shift due to the planet's gravitational pull causing the star to move.

The RV method gives the semi-amplitude K, which is related to the mass of the planet and the orbital distance. The formula for K is:

K = (v) = ( (G * (M_star) ) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) * (1 - e^2))^(1/2) ) )^(1/3) * (sin i) / ( (1 + M_planet/M_star)^(2/3)) )

Wait, but since the planets have much smaller masses than the star, M_planet << M_star. So we can simplify this. Also, since the orbits are circular, e is zero, so we can ignore that term.

The formula for K (radial velocity semi-amplitude) is approximately:

K = ( (G * M_planet * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) * (4π²)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2)) ) ) )^(1/3) * (1 / a^(1/3)) )

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the relation between K and the planet's mass and orbital period. Alternatively, I remember that the RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = ( (27 * pi * G) / (c) )^(1/3) * (M_planet sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) )

Hmm, that's getting complicated. Alternatively, another approach is to use the formula for the velocity semi-amplitude:

K = (v) = ( ( (G * M_star) / (P * (1 + M_planet/M_star)^(2/3)) ) ) )^(1/3) * sin i 

But wait, maybe another way. Since the RV method gives the velocity of the star's reflex motion, which is related to the mass of the planet and the distance. But I'm getting a bit stuck on the exact formula. Let me think differently.

The problem gives the shifts in the forbidden line [OI] at 6300 Å. The shifts are 0.03 Å for Planet1 and 0.04 Å for Planet2. Wait, that's the Doppler shift, which corresponds to the velocity of the
