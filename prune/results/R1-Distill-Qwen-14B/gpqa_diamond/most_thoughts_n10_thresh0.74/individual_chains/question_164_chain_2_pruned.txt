Alright, let me try to work through this problem. Hmm, okay, so we have two binary star systems, system_1 and system_2. Both show eclipses, and their periods are 2 years and 1 year respectively. The radial velocity (RV) variations in each system are sinusoidal, with certain amplitudes.

Wait, so the question is asking by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2. And mass is the sum of the two stars in each system. So I need to find the ratio of the masses of system_1 to system_2.

I remember that in binary star systems, the radial velocity method is used to find the masses. The RV amplitude is related to the mass of the star. But wait, how exactly? Oh right, the more massive star will have a smaller RV amplitude because it's moving less. Because in a binary system, the two stars orbit their common center of mass. The more massive one has a smaller orbit, so its velocity change (as measured from the RV) is smaller. So the ratio of the velocities is inversely proportional to the masses.

So in system_1, the RV amplitudes are 10 km/s and 5 km/s. That must mean that the two stars have masses in the ratio of 5:10, which simplifies to 1:2. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the velocity is inversely proportional to mass. So if one star has velocity v1 and the other v2, then m1/m2 = v2/v1. Because m1*v1 = m2
