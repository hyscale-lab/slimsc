Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through the question carefully.

Alright, the question involves three exoplanets: Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3. They're using the transit timing variation (TTV) method, which I remember is used to detect planets by observing how their gravitational influences cause variations in the transit times of their host star. But maybe that's not directly relevant here.

The key data given are the ratios of their equilibrium temperatures and masses. The equilibrium temperature ratio between Planet1 and Planet2 is about 1.4, and between Planet2 and Planet3, it's about 2.3. Mass ratios are 1.15 between Planet1 and Planet2, and 1.35 between Planet2 and Planet3. I need to find out by what factor the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than Planet1's. Albedo is the same for all (0.3), which is similar to Earth's, so that should be a constant factor in the equations.

Hmm, equilibrium temperature... I remember the formula for equilibrium temperature involves the star's luminosity, the planet's distance from the star, and the planet's albedo. The formula is T = [(L / (16πσ d²)) * (1 - a)]^(1/4), where L is the star's luminosity, d is the distance, a is albedo, σ is Stefan-Boltzmann constant.

But wait, since all three planets are orbiting the same star, L and σ will be the same for each. The albedo a is given as 0.3 for all, so it cancels out when taking ratios. So the equilibrium temperature ratio depends on the inverse square root of the distance ratio.

The equilibrium temperature ratio between Planet1 and Planet2 is 1.4. Let's denote this as T1/T2 = 1.4. Since T is proportional to (1/d)^(1/2), then T1/T2 = sqrt(d2/d1). So, T1/T2 = sqrt(d2/d1) → (1.4)^2 = d2/d1 → d2 = (1.4)^2 * d1. Let me compute 1.4 squared: 1.96. So d2 is 1.96 times d1.

Similarly, the ratio between Planet2 and Planet3 is 2.3. So T2/T3 = 2.3. Using the same logic, T2/T3 = sqrt(d3/d2). Squaring both sides gives (2.3)^2 = d3/d2. 2.3 squared is about 5.29. So d3 = 5.29 * d2.

But wait, I already have d2 in terms of d1. Since d2 = 1.96 d1, then d3 = 5.29 * 1.96 d1. Let me calculate that: 5.29 * 1.96. Let me compute 5 * 1.96 is 9.8, 0.29 *1.96 is about 0.5684. So total is approximately 10.3684. So d3 ≈ 10.368 d1. So the distance of Planet3 is about 10.368 times that of Planet1.

But the question is about the orbital period. From Kepler's third law, the orbital period squared is proportional to the semi-major axis cubed, assuming a circular orbit and same central body (the star). So P^2 ∝ a^3. Since the distance d here is the semi-major axis, then P1^2 / P3^2 = (d1^3) / (d3^3) → P3/P1 = (d3/d1)^(3/2).

We have d3/d1 ≈10.368, so (10.368)^(3/2). Hmm, let's compute that. First, sqrt(10.368) is about 3.22 because 3^2 is 9, 3.22^2 is about 10.3684. So sqrt is 3.22. Then, 3.22 cubed. Let's compute 3^3 =27, 0.22^3 is about 0.0106. But wait, 3.22^3 is (3 + 0.22)^3. Using binomial expansion: 3^3 +3*(3^2)*0.22 +3*(3)*(0.22)^2 + (0.22)^3. That's 27 + 3*9*0.22= 27 +5.94=32.94, then 3*3*0.0484=0.4356, 0.010648. Adding them all: 27 +5.94=32.94, +0.4356=33.3756, +0.010648≈33.386. So 3.22^3 ≈ 33.386. So P3/P1 ≈ sqrt(10.368) cubed, which is approximately 33.386. So about 33.4 times. But wait, the options have D) ~33.4.

Wait, but let me double-check. Because Kepler's third law is P^2 = (4π²/GM) * a^3. So the period is proportional to a^(3/2). So if a3 is about 10.368 a1, then P3 is (10.368)^(3/2) times P1.

Wait, correct. So 10.368^(3/2) is the same as sqrt(10.368)^3. Which is approximately 3.22^3, which as I calculated earlier is about 33.4. So the factor is approximately 33.4. So the period of Planet3 is about 33.4 times that of Planet1.

Looking back at the options, option D is ~33.4. So that's the answer.

Wait, but what about the mass ratios? The question gave mass ratios between the planets, but I didn't use them in my calculation. Hmmm. Let me think about that. The problem statement gives the mass ratios: Planet1 to Planet2 is 1.15, and Planet2 to Planet3 is 1.35. But in Kepler's third law, the period depends on the mass of the star, not the planet. Since the problem doesn't mention the star's mass varying, I think the planet masses don't affect the orbital period. So the mass information might be a red herring, or perhaps for a different part of the problem not relevant here.

So, the key is that the period depends only on the distance, and the distance ratios are determined by the temperature ratios. So the mass ratios don't factor into this particular calculation. Therefore, the answer should be D) ~33.4.


To determine the factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1, we use the given equilibrium temperature ratios and Kepler's third law. The equilibrium temperature \( T \) is proportional to \( \left(\frac{1}{d}\right)^{1/2} \), where \( d \) is the distance from the star. Since all planets orbit the same star and have the same albedo, the temperature ratios directly give us the distance ratios.

1. **Distance Ratios**:  
   - From \( T_1 / T_2 = 1.4 \), we have \( \sqrt{d_2 / d_1} = 1.4 \). Squaring both sides, \( d_2 / d_1 = 1.96 \), so \( d_2 = 1.96 \, d_1 \).  
   - From \( T_2 / T_3 = 2.3 \), we have \( \sqrt{d_3 / d_2} = 2.3 \). Squaring both sides, \( d_3 / d_2 = 5.29 \), so \( d_3 = 5.29 \, d_2 \).  
   - Substituting \( d_2 = 1.96 \, d_1 \) into \( d_3 = 5.29 \, d_2 \), we get \( d_3 = 5.29 \times 1.96 \, d_1 \).  
   - Calculating \( 5.29 \times 1.96 \), we find \( d_3 \approx 10.368 \, d_1 \).

2. **Orbital Period Ratio**:  
   Kepler's third law states \( P^2 \propto d^3 \), so \( P_3 / P_1 = \left(d_3 / d_1\right)^{3/2} \).  
   Substituting \( d_3 / d_1 \approx 10.368 \), we calculate \( \left(10.368\right)^{3/2} \).  
   First, \( \sqrt{10.368} \approx 3.22 \), and then \( 3.22^3 \approx 33.4 \).  
   Thus, \( P_3 / P_1 \approx 33.4 \).

The mass ratios provided are irrelevant to the orbital period calculation, as the period depends only on the distance from the star and the star's mass, not the planet's mass.

**Answer**: D
