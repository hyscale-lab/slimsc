Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about the area of a pseudosphere with a given metric. Hmm, I remember that a pseudosphere is a type of surface in hyperbolic geometry, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details. Let me think about what the metric represents.

The metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, that looks a bit like the metric for a sphere but with a different denominator. Oh right, because for a sphere of radius a, the metric is usually (a²)/(x² + y² + z²) multiplied by some terms, but in this case, the denominator is 4 - x² - y². So maybe this is a different kind of surface.

I think pseudospheres are related to hyperbolic space. So maybe this metric is describing a hyperbolic space, perhaps something like the Poincaré disk model. The Poincaré disk model has a metric that involves 1/(1 - x² - y²)² times (dx² + dy²), but this metric here has 32/(4 - x² - y²) times (dx² + dy²). Wait, let me see the denominator: 4 - x² - y². That's similar to 1 - (x² + y²)/4. So perhaps it's scaled by a factor.

Let me try to rewrite the metric. Let me factor out the denominator: 4 - x² - y² = 4(1 - (x² + y²)/4). So the metric becomes (32)/(4(1 - (x² + y²)/4)) (dx² + dy²) = (8)/(1 - (x² + y²)/4) (dx² + dy²). Oh, I see. So the Poincaré disk model usually has a metric of (4r²)/(4 - x² - y²) times (dx² + dy²), where r is the radius. Wait, but I might be mixing up things.

Alternatively, maybe this is a metric for a sphere in some coordinate system. Wait, another thought: sometimes when you have a metric like this, it's a conformally flat metric, meaning it's a scalar multiple of the Euclidean metric. So the area element would be the square root of the determinant times dx dy. But since this is a 2D metric, the area element is sqrt(g) dx dy, where g is the determinant of the metric tensor.

Wait, the metric tensor here is diagonal, so the determinant would just be the product of the coefficients for dx² and dy². But in this case, both are multiplied by the same factor, 32/(4 - x² - y²). So the determinant g is [32/(4 - x² - y²)]². Therefore, the area element is sqrt(g) dx dy, which is [32/(4 - x² - y²)] dx dy.

Wait, wait, no. The area element for a 2D metric ds² = E dx² + G dy² is sqrt(EG) dx dy. Since E and G are both equal to 32/(4 - x² - y²), sqrt(EG) would be 32/(4 - x² - y²). So the area element dA is [32/(4 - x² - y²)] dx dy.

But wait, the question is about the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2. Hmm, pseudospheres are surfaces with constant negative curvature. The area of a pseudosphere, or more generally a hyperbolic surface, might be finite or infinite depending on the model. Wait, the Poincaré disk model has finite area? No, wait, the Poincaré disk is a model of hyperbolic space, which is infinite in extent but has finite area when considering all points. Wait, no. Wait, the Poincaré disk is a model where the entire hyperbolic plane is represented in a finite disk, but the area is still infinite because it's a model of an infinitely large space.

Wait, but maybe the question is referring to a pseudosphere embedded in Euclidean space. Wait,
