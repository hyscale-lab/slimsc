Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this chemistry question about dyes and the colors they absorb. Let's see what the question says. The question is about a textile dye that has extensively conjugated pi-electrons, and it emits light with an energy of 2.3393 eV. The question is asking what color of light is absorbed by the organic compound. The options are red, violet, blue, or yellow.

Hmm, I remember that when a compound absorbs certain wavelengths of light, it emits others. Like in fluorescence or phosphorescence, the material absorbs higher energy and emits lower energy light. So the energy of the emitted light is lower than what's absorbed. Wait, because when an electron gets excited, it goes to a higher energy state, and then when it drops back, it emits a photon. So the energy of the absorbed photon must be higher than the emitted one.

The energy of the emitted light is given as 2.3393 eV. To find out the wavelength of this emitted light, I can use the equation E = hc/λ. Where h is Planck's constant, c is the speed of light, and λ is the wavelength. But wait, since the question is about the absorbed light, which is higher in energy, I should find that first.

Alternatively, maybe I can think about the electromagnetic spectrum in terms of energy. I remember that visible light has wavelengths from about 400 nm (violet) to 700 nm (red). The energy increases as the wavelength decreases because E is inversely proportional to λ. So higher energy corresponds to shorter wavelength (like blue, violet) and lower energy to longer wavelength (like red, orange, yellow).

Wait, the emitted light is 2.3393 eV. Let me calculate what that corresponds to in terms of wavelength. Let's plug into E = hc/λ.

I know that Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626 x 10^-34 J·s, and the speed of light c is about 3.0 x 10^8 m/s. But since we're dealing with eV, which is energy in electron volts, maybe there's a shortcut. Oh right, 1 eV is 1.602 x 10^-19 J. So the energy E is 2.3393 eV, which is 2.3393 * 1.602e-19 J.

But wait, there's a formula where E (in eV) = 1240 / λ (in nm). Because 1240 eV·nm is approximately hc in eV·nm units. So rearranging, λ = 1240 / E(eV) in nm.

So plugging in E=2.3393 eV, λ = 1240 / 2.3393 ≈ let's calculate that. 1240 divided by 2.3393... Let's see, 2.3393 is approximately 2.34. 1240 / 2.34 is about 529.83 nm. So about 530 nm. I know that 530 nm is in the green range, but wait, the options are red, violet, blue, yellow. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait wait, but the emitted light is from the dye, which is fluorescence. So the dye absorbed higher energy photons and then emitted lower energy. So the absorbed photon must have higher energy than the emitted.

So if the emitted wavelength is 530 nm (green), the absorbed wavelength would be shorter (higher energy) than that. Because the energy of the absorbed photon is E_abs = hc/λ_abs. Since λ_abs < λ_emit, E_abs > E_emit.

Wait, but wait, the question is about the color absorbed. So if the dye emits green, it must have absorbed a higher energy photon. Higher energy photons are in the blue or violet range.

Wait, let me think again. If the dye emits green light, that's around 530 nm. So the absorbed light would have a shorter wavelength, meaning higher energy. So the absorbed light would be in the blue or violet region, which have higher energy than green.

So the options are violet and blue. Now, the question is about the color absorbed. So the dye absorbs higher energy (shorter wavelength) light and emits lower energy (longer wavelength) light.

Wait, but wait, what's the relationship between the energy of the absorbed photon and the emitted photon? The energy of the absorbed photon must be higher than the emitted photon. Because the molecule must have some energy gap. So the energy difference between the excited state and the ground state is the energy of the emitted photon. So E_abs - E_emit = energy gap. So E_abs = E_emit + energy gap. So E_abs is higher than E_emit.

In this case, E_emit is 2.3393 eV. So the absorbed photon has higher energy. So the wavelength of the absorbed photon is shorter than 530 nm.

What color is that? Let's see: the visible spectrum goes from about 400 nm (violet) to 700 nm (red).

So if the emitted light is 530 nm (green), the absorbed must be a wavelength shorter than that, which would be blue or violet.

But wait, the question is about what color the compound absorbs. So which color is absorbed?

Let me think about the complementary colors. Wait, if something emits green, it's because it absorbed a higher energy photon (blue or violet) and emitted green. But wait, no, the absorbed photon is higher in energy. So the compound absorbs, say, blue and emits green?

Wait, but in fluorescence, the absorbed photon has higher energy than the emitted. So the absorbed photon's wavelength is shorter (higher energy) than the emitted.

So let's think about colors. For example, if a substance emits red, it absorbed something with higher energy, maybe blue or violet.

Wait, but in this problem, the emitted energy is 2.3393 eV, which is about 530 nm (green). The absorbed photon must have higher energy, so shorter wavelength, which would be in the blue or violet region.

The options are A) Red (about 650-700 nm), B) Violet (400-440), C) Blue (450-495), D) Yellow (570-590). So the absorbed photon is shorter than 530 nm. So either violet (400-440) or blue (450-495).

Which is shorter? Violet is shorter, so higher energy than blue. So if the emitted is green (530 nm), the absorbed would be either blue or violet. So the options are B or C.

But the question is what color is absorbed. So if the compound emits green, the absorbed must be a higher energy color.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should think in terms of energy. The energy of emitted light (E_emit) is 2.3393 eV. The energy of absorbed light (E_abs) is higher than that. So E_abs > 2.3393 eV.

Each color has a characteristic energy. Let me list approximate energies for each color.

Violet: ~2.8 eV (400 nm: 1240/400 ≈ 3.1 eV? Wait wait, wait, 1240 divided by 400 is 3.1, which is 3.1 eV. Hmm, that would be higher than 2.34 eV. So violet light has higher energy than our emitted green (2.34 eV). So if the dye absorbs violet, it would emit green.

Similarly, blue light is about 450 nm. 1240 /450 ≈ 2.755 eV. So that's higher than 2.34. So if it absorbs blue, then emits green.

So both violet and blue have higher energy than green. So the compound could absorb either violet or blue.

But what is the correct answer among the options given? The options are B) Violet and C) Blue.

Wait, the question is about the color absorbed. So the compound absorbs higher energy (shorter wavelength) light. So the compound's absorption maxima is in the blue or violet region.

But which one is it? How to decide between blue and violet.

Wait, the question mentions that the dye has extensively conjugated pi-electrons. Extensive conjugation usually leads to longer conjugated systems, which absorb lower energy (longer wavelength) light. Wait, no, wait. The more conjugated the system, the longer the conjugation, the lower the energy required to promote electrons, meaning lower energy (longer wavelength) absorption. Or is it higher energy?

Wait, I think that as the conjugation increases, the energy gap between the HOMO and LUMO decreases. Because the more delocalized the electrons are, the smaller the energy needed to excite them. So the energy required for the transition, E = hc/λ, so lower energy corresponds to longer λ. So increased conjugation leads to lower energy (longer wavelength) absorption.

Wait, but wait, I'm a bit mixed up. For conjugated dienes, increasing the number of conjugated double bonds lowers the energy gap (E). Because the molecular orbitals become more delocalized, so the energy difference between the highest occupied and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals decreases.

So if the conjugation is extensive, the molecule absorbs lower energy (longer wavelength) light. So for example, something like beta-carotene, which has a lot of conjugated double bonds, absorbs in the visible range (orange-red) and emits in the lower energy (red) or higher? Wait, no, it's about their absorption.

Wait, correction: when a molecule absorbs a photon, it's usually in the visible range if it's a dye. The energy of the absorbed photon corresponds to the energy gap. So a larger conjugated system would have a smaller energy gap, meaning lower energy (longer wavelength) light is absorbed. For example, ethylene (small conjugated system) absorbs UV (higher energy, shorter wavelength), while larger conjugated systems like dyes absorb visible light.

So if the dye in the question has extensive conjugation, it would have a lower energy transition. So the absorbed photon's energy would be lower than something with less conjugation. Wait, no, wait, if the energy gap is smaller, then the required photon energy (E) is smaller. So the molecule absorbs lower energy (longer wavelength) light.

Wait, but wait: E = hc/λ. If the energy gap is smaller, E is smaller, which implies λ is larger. So, longer wavelength (lower energy) is absorbed. So a molecule with a larger conjugated system absorbs at a longer wavelength, which is a lower energy.

Wait, but in this problem, the emitted light is 2.3393 eV. The energy of the absorbed photon must be higher than that because the molecule goes from ground state to excited state, then emits a photon upon relaxation.

So if the molecule has a large conjugated system, the energy gap is small. So the energy of the absorbed photon would be just a bit higher than the emitted photon. So the absorbed photon's energy is E_abs = E_emit + (energy gap). But if the energy gap is small, E_abs is only a little higher than E_emit.

Wait, the energy of the emitted photon is 2.34 eV. The energy of the absorbed photon must be higher than that. So if the conjugated system is large, the energy gap is small, so E_abs is just a bit higher. So the absorbed photon would have a wavelength just a bit shorter than the emitted photon's wavelength.

Wait, the emitted photon is 2.34 eV, which is about 530 nm. So the absorbed photon would be a bit shorter than 530 nm. Let me think about the visible spectrum. 530 is green. So a bit shorter than that is blue or maybe cyan, but the options are violet and blue.

If the conjugated system is extensive, the HOMO-LUMO gap is small, so the absorbed photon's energy is just a bit higher than the emitted. So the absorbed photon would be in the blue or green region.

Wait, but in this case, the emitted is 530 nm (green), so the absorbed must be higher energy than that, so in the blue or violet. But if the conjugated system is extensive, the absorption maximum would be longer than the emission? Or maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the complementary colors. The color that a compound absorbs is the complementary color of the color it emits. For example, if a compound emits green, it absorbs magenta (which is a combination of blue and red), but I'm not sure if that's the right approach here.

Alternatively, the energy of the absorbed photon (E_abs) and emitted photon (E_emit) must satisfy E_abs = E_emit + energy difference. Since the molecule must have some energy gap, which is the energy difference between the states. But without knowing the exact energy gap, it's hard to say.

Wait, another approach: Let's compute the wavelength of the emitted photon. E = 2.3393 eV. Using E = 1240 / λ (in nm), so λ = 1240 / 2.3393 ≈ 530 nm, which is green.

So the emitted light is green. The absorbed light is higher in energy, so lower wavelength than 530 nm. So in the blue or violet region.

Now, the options are B) Violet and C) Blue.

Which color is absorbed?

If I consider that green is around 530 nm, the absorbed photon must be in the blue or violet. So for example, blue is around 470 nm, which is about 2.64 eV (1240/470 ≈ 2.638 eV), and violet is around 400 nm, which is about 3.1 eV.

Since the dye has extensive conjugation, the energy gap is small. So the absorbed photon's energy is just a bit higher than the emitted. So E_abs is close to E_emit.

E_emit is 2.3393 eV. Let's see: if the energy gap is small, say, 0.1 eV, E_abs would be about 2.44 eV, which is about 508 nm, still green. Hmm, but that's longer than the emitted wavelength, which is 530 nm. Wait, no, because E_abs = E_emit + energy gap. So if E_abs is higher, the wavelength is shorter.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused again.

If a molecule has a HOMO-LUMO gap of, say, 3 eV, the photon absorbed is 3 eV. Then, when it emits, it could emit at a lower energy, like 2.3 eV. So the absorbed photon is 3 eV (413 nm, which is violet), emitted at 2.3 eV (530 nm, green). So in this case, the dye would absorb violet and emit green.

But if the conjugation is extensive, the HOMO-LUMO gap is smaller. Let's say the gap is 2.5 eV. Then, the absorbed photon is 2.5 eV (496 nm, which is blue). When it emits, the photon is 2.34 eV (530 nm, green). So the energy gap is 0.16 eV. Hmm, but that seems small, but maybe possible.

So in this case, the color absorbed could be either blue or violet, depending on the energy gap. But without knowing the exact value, how do I choose between B and C?

Wait, the question says the compound emits light with energy 2.3393 eV. So the emitted color is green, and the absorbed color is higher energy (blue or violet).

What's the typical case for dyes? Many dyes absorb in the visible range and emit in the visible range as well. For example, a dye that absorbs blue and emits green, or absorbs violet and emits blue.

But in this case, the emitted energy is green (2.34 eV), so the absorbed must be higher. So the options are B or C.

Wait, maybe the question is about the complement color. The color absorbed is the complement of the emitted color. The complement of green is magenta, which isn't an option. So that might not help.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy of the absorbed photon is approximately the same as the energy of the emission plus a small gap. So if the emission is 2.34 eV, the absorption would be, say, 2.8 eV (440 nm, which is blue/violet). Let me compute 2.8 eV gives wavelength 1240/2.8≈442.8 nm, which is blue-violet.

Hmm, but without more information, it's hard to know exactly. Let me think about the options again. The options are A) Red (low energy), B) Violet (high energy), C) Blue (moderate), D) Yellow (even lower than green).

Wait, wait. The question is what color is absorbed. The compound emits green (2.34 eV), so it must absorb higher energy (shorter wavelength) light. Among the options, B is violet (higher energy than green), and C is blue (slightly higher than green). So both B and C are possible.

But what's more likely for a compound with extensive conjugation?

Extensive conjugation leads to lower energy (longer wavelength) absorption. So the compound would absorb at a longer wavelength. Wait, no, higher conjugation leads to lower energy transition, so lower energy (longer wavelength) is absorbed. That would be a lower energy photon, so the compound would emit something with lower energy than what it absorbed.

Wait, no, the molecule absorbs a higher energy photon (shorter wavelength) and emits a lower energy photon (longer wavelength). So if the molecule has a larger conjugated system, the energy gap is smaller. So the absorbed photon's energy is only a little higher than the emitted. So the absorbed wavelength is just a bit shorter than the emitted.

So if the emitted is 530 nm (green), the absorbed would be just a bit shorter, say, 500 nm, which is blue. Because 500 nm is blue.

Wait, but 500 nm is blue, which is option C.

Alternatively, if the conjugation is extensive, maybe the absorbed photon is in the blue region.

So the answer would be C) Blue.

Wait, but wait another thought. If the conjugated system is long, the absorption maximum would be at a longer wavelength (lower energy). So if the molecule has a long conjugation, the absorption is at a longer wavelength (lower energy), which is a lower frequency, so the absorbed photon's energy is lower. But wait, the energy of the absorbed photon must be higher than the emitted photon.

Wait, that's conflicting. Let me think clearly.

The energy of the absorbed photon (E_abs) is higher than the emitted (E_emit). So E_abs > E_emit.

The conjugation length affects the energy gap (E_gap). A longer conjugation implies a smaller E_gap.

So E_abs = E_emit + E_gap.

If E_gap is small, then E_abs is only a little higher than E_emit.

So, for E_emit=2.34 eV, E_abs = 2.34 + small delta.

So, E_abs is about, say, 2.5 eV. What is 2.5 eV in wavelength?

1240/2.5 = 496 nm, which is blue.

So the absorbed photon is blue.

So the answer would be C) Blue.

Alternatively, if E_abs is 3.0 eV, which is 413 nm (violet), but that's a larger E_gap. If the conjugation is extensive, the E_gap would be small, so E_abs is not too much higher than E_emit.

So in that case, the absorbed photon is blue, not violet.

Therefore, the correct answer is B or C? Hmm.

Wait, the example I thought earlier: E_emit=2.34 eV, E_abs=2.5 eV (blue). So the absorbed color is blue.

But wait, another way to think: the energy of the emitted photon is 2.34 eV, which is in the green part of the spectrum. The energy of the absorbed photon must be higher. So the compound absorbs either blue or violet.

But the question is about what color is absorbed. If the compound emits green, it must have absorbed a higher energy photon. Since the options are B) Violet and C) Blue, which are both higher in energy than green.

So the problem is to choose between blue and violet.

But which one is more likely? The energy of the emitted photon is 2.34 eV, so the absorbed photon must be higher. Let's compute what E_abs would be for each option.

Option B: Violet light is around 400 nm. E_abs = 1240 / 400 ≈ 3.1 eV.

Option C: Blue light is around 450 nm. E_abs = 1240 / 450 ≈ 2.76 eV.

So if the energy emitted is 2.34 eV, the absorbed photon is either 3.1 eV (violet) or 2.76 eV (blue).

The question is which one is absorbed by the compound with extensive conjugation.

As I recall, molecules with extensive conjugation have lower energy transitions, so the absorbed photon would have a lower energy than if the conjugation were less. Wait, no. Extensive conjugation leads to a lower energy gap. So E_abs would be higher than E_emit, but by a smaller amount.

Wait, perhaps the difference between E_abs and E_emit is smaller when conjugation is extensive.

So for example, if the molecule has a small conjugation, it might absorb at a higher energy (violet), with a larger E_gap. But with extensive conjugation, the E_gap is smaller, so the E_abs is not much higher than E_emit, meaning the absorbed photon is in the blue region.

So in this case, the absorbed photon is blue, making the correct answer C) Blue.

Alternatively, maybe the dye absorbs in the blue region and emits green. So the answer is blue.

But then again, I'm not entirely certain. Another approach: think about the colors. If a compound emits green, what color does it absorb? It would absorb the color that's higher in energy than green. So blue and violet are both higher than green.

But how to decide between them? Without more specific data, it's tricky. Perhaps the key is that extensive conjugation leads to lower energy transitions, which would mean the absorption is in the longer wavelength (lower energy) side. So in the visible range, that would be blue instead of violet.

Alternatively, maybe the color absorbed is blue because blue is a higher energy than green, but violet is even higher. So if the conjugation is extensive, the absorption might be into the blue.

Wait, but let me think about real-world examples. Fluorescent dyes like fluorescein emit in the green region when excited by UV light. But perhaps they absorb in the blue or even UV. But the question here is about the color absorbed, which could be in the visible range.

Wait, for example, if a dye emits green, it's possible that it absorbs blue light. Because blue is higher energy than green. So the dye could be absorbing blue and emitting green, which would make option C) Blue the correct answer.

Alternatively, if it absorbs violet, then emits green, that would be option B.

Hmm. I'm a bit stuck between B and C.

Wait, another approach: knowing that the energy of visible light is given as:

Violet: ~3.0-3.5 eV

Blue: ~2.5-3.0 eV

Green: ~2.0-2.5 eV

Yellow: ~2.0-2.2 eV

Red: ~1.8-2.0 eV

Wait, but wait, my memory might be off. Let me think about the energy of each color. The energy is inversely proportional to wavelength. So violet (shortest wavelength, highest energy) is about 3.1 eV (400 nm). Blue is about 2.76 eV (440 nm), green is 2.34 eV (530 nm), yellow is 2.13 eV (580 nm), red is 1.98 eV (620 nm).

So E_abs must be higher than 2.34 eV. So E_abs could be in blue (2.76 eV) or violet (3.1 eV).

Wait, if the compound has extensive conjugation, the E_gap is smaller. So E_abs is just a little higher than E_emit. So E_abs could be 2.5 eV (496 nm, blue).

So the absorbed color is blue.

So the correct answer is C) Blue.


To determine the color of light absorbed by the organic compound, we analyze the relationship between the energy of the emitted and absorbed photons. The compound emits light with an energy of 2.3393 eV, which corresponds to a wavelength of approximately 530 nm (green light). Since the energy of the absorbed photon must be higher than the emitted photon (as the molecule transitions from the ground state to an excited state), the absorbed photon must have a shorter wavelength (higher energy) than 530 nm.

Using the equation \( E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} \), where \( E \) is energy, \( h \) is Planck's constant, \( c \) is the speed of light, and \( \lambda \) is wavelength, we calculate the energy of photons for the given options:

- **Red (650–700 nm):** Energy is approximately 1.77–1.83 eV, which is lower than 2.3393 eV. Red light cannot be absorbed because the energy is insufficient.
- **Violet (400–440 nm):** Energy is approximately 2.82–3.10 eV, which is higher than 2.3393 eV. Violet light is a candidate for absorption.
- **Blue (450–495 nm):** Energy is approximately 2.51–2.76 eV, which is also higher than 2.3393 eV. Blue light is another candidate for absorption.
- **Yellow (570–590 nm):** Energy is approximately 2.10–2.17 eV, which is lower than 2.3393 eV. Yellow light cannot be absorbed.

The compound has extensively conjugated \( \pi \)-electrons, which typically result in a smaller HOMO-LUMO energy gap. This means the absorbed photon's energy is only slightly higher than the emitted photon's energy. For an emitted energy of 2.3393 eV (green), the absorbed photon is likely in the blue region (around 2.5–2.76 eV), as this corresponds to a smaller energy gap compared to violet light (3.1 eV).

Thus, the compound absorbs blue light and emits green light. The correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
