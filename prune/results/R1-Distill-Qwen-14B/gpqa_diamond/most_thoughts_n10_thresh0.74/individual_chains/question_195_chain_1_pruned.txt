Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this stuff, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again carefully.

Alright, the question is about two planets orbiting the same star. The first planet has Earth's radius, is in a circular orbit, and transits with an impact parameter of 0.2. The star is 1.5 times the Sun's radius. The first planet's orbital period is 3 days. Now, they want to find the maximum orbital period for a second planet (radius 2.5 Earth) such that both transit and occultation events occur. Both planets are in circular orbits in the same plane.

Hmm, I remember that for a planet to transit, it must pass directly in front of the star from our point of view. Similarly, occultation happens when the planet passes behind the star, right? So for both events to happen, the orbital periods of the two planets must be such that their orbital positions align in these ways.

Wait, but wait. I think the key here is about the Hill sphere or maybe orbital stability. Or perhaps it's about the synodic period? Or maybe it's about the relative orbital speeds allowing for the second planet to both transit and be occulted.

Wait, but I think the question is about the orbital periods of the two planets allowing for the second planet to transit and also have an occultation. So for the second planet to transit, it must be closer to the star than the first planet, right? Because if it's further out, it can't transit. No, wait, no. Wait, when a planet transits, it passes in front of the star. So if the second planet is further out, then when it transits, the first planet (which is closer) would be moving faster. Hmm, but maybe I should think about orbital velocities.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to break it down.

First, the star's radius is 1.5 solar radii. The first planet's radius is Earth-sized, so R1 = 1 Earth radius. The second planet is 2.5 Earth radii. The key is that for both planets to transit, their orbital distances must allow their respective transit conditions. Wait, but the question says the second planet should exhibit both transit and occultation events. So maybe the second planet's orbit is such that, from our point of view, sometimes it
