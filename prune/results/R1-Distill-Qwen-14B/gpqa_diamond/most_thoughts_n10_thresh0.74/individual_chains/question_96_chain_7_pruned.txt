Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the entropy of a supermassive black hole. Hmm, I remember that the entropy of a black hole is related to its area, specifically the event horizon area. Oh right, the formula is something like S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B), where A is the area, c is the speed of light, ħ is the reduced Planck constant, G is Newton's constant, and k_B is Boltzmann's constant. So first, I need to find the area of the event horizon.

The question gives me the angular size theta and the distance d. Oh wait, the angular size is small, so I can use the approximation that the angle in radians is approximately equal to the ratio of the diameter of the event horizon (which is 2r, where r is the Schwarzschild radius) divided by the distance d. So theta ≈ (2r)/d.

Wait, but I need to find r, the Schwarzschild radius. Oh right, the Schwarzschild radius r_s is (2 G M)/c^2. So the diameter is 2r_s = 4 G M / c^2.

So putting it together, theta ≈ (4 G M / c^2) / d. Solving for M would give me the mass, but maybe I don't need to find M directly because entropy depends on the area. Let me think: the area A of the event horizon is 4 pi r_s^2. Since r_s is (2 G M)/c^2, A = 4 pi ( (2 G M)/(c^2) )^2 = 16 pi G^2 M^2 / c^4.

Wait, but from the angular size, I can find r_s. Let's write theta in radians. Theta in radians is about (2 r_s)/d, because the diameter is 2r_s. So r_s ≈ theta * d * (c^2)/(4 G M), wait no, let me re-derive this.

Wait, theta is given in degrees, so I have to convert it to radians first. Because 1 degree is pi/180 radians. So theta in radians is 1e-17 degrees * (pi/180) = 1e-17 * pi / 180 radians.

So theta ≈ (2 r_s) / d. Because the angular size is the diameter
