Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here. Let me try to break it down step by step. Hmm, the question is a bit complex, but I'll take it slowly.

So, the question is about a substance X reacting with liquid Y. They react violently and release gas W. The molecule of gas W has the same number of neutrons and protons. Then, a precipitate G forms, which when heated releases B. B's melting point is close to 277 K. Also, when a certain keto acid reacts with X, the product has two oxygen atoms.

Additionally, substance X and its analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry. So maybe X is something like a strong base or a metal that's used in reactions like Grignard reagents? Wait, Grignard reagents are organomagnesium compounds, but they require a metal like Mg. Alternatively, maybe X is something like Na or another alkali metal, but wait, the mention of isotopes makes me think heavier isotopes are involved.

The first part: Gas W's molecule has same number of neutrons and protons. So for a molecule, the total would be the sum of each atom's protons and neutrons. Wait, but the question says "the molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons." So maybe it's a molecule where each atom contributes, and their total neutrons equal total protons.

Wait, but that's a bit unclear. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule itself as a whole has equal number of protons and neutrons. Like, for example, H2O: but H2O has 10 protons (H:1x2, O:8) and (H:0x2 + O:8) =8 neutrons. No, that's not equal.

Wait, maybe a diatomic molecule? Let me think of possible gases. CO2 is a gas, but when metals react with acids, they produce CO2. Alternatively, H2 gas? Let's see: H2 has 2 H atoms. Each H has 1 proton and 0 neutrons (if it's protium). So total protons: 2, neutrons: 0. Not equal.

Wait, another approach: Maybe the molecule is something like CO2 (carbon dioxide). But let's calculate. CO2 has a molecule with 1 C (which has 6 protons and 6 neutrons typically) and 2 O (8 each
