Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Hmm, muons are elementary particles, similar to electrons but heavier. But maybe that's not too relevant for the problem at hand.

The question is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator A_y, which is given as A_y = c · S. Oh wait, right, c is h/(4π), and S is a 2x2 matrix. The first row of S is (0, -i) and the second row is (i, 0). So I need to write out the matrix for A_y first.

Let me jot down what S looks like. So S is a 2x2 matrix:

S = [ [0, -i],
       [i,  0] ]

And c is h/(4π). So A_y = c * S. So each element of S is multiplied by c.

So A_y matrix is:

A_y = [ [0, -i*c],
         [i*c, 0] ]

But wait, c is h/(4π), so let me substitute that. So A_y becomes:

[ [0, -i*(h/(4π))],
  [i*(h/(4π)), 0] ]

Hmm, okay. So now, we need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A_y. Eigenvalue equation is A_y φ = a φ, where a is the eigenvalue.

I remember that for a 2x2 matrix, the eigenvalues can be found by solving the characteristic equation det(A_y - a I) = 0.

So let's write that out. The matrix A_y - a I is:

[ [-a, -i c ],
  [i c, -a ] ]

The determinant of this is (-a)(-a) - ( (-i c)(i c) ). Let's compute that.

So determinant = a² - ( (-i c)(i c) )

Wait, what's (-i c)(i c)? Let's compute. (-i)*(i) = -i² = -(-1) = 1. And c squared is (h/(4π))². So the term is (1) * (h²/(16 π²)).

Wait, so the determinant is a² - ( ( (-i c) * (i c)
