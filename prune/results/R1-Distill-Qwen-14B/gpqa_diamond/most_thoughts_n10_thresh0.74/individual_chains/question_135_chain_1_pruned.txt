Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question is about the decay modes of a boson X. The given Lagrangian is L(y) = -λf f-bar ψf(y) (v + X(y)) ψf(y). Wait, actually, I think I misread that. Let me parse it again. Oh right, the interaction term is probably L_int = -λ [ψ_f]^† (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y), where ψ_f is a fermion field. Hmm, no, looking closely, the original expression is written as L(y) = -λ f ψ_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, that doesn't look quite right. Maybe the correct form is more like L = -λ f ψ_f† (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). So X is a boson that couples to fermions, and the coupling is proportional to X times the fermion fields.

The mass of the boson X is given as 6 GeV. The question is about the kinematically allowed decays of X at the lowest order.

The options are A, B, C, D. Each lists possible fermion-antifermion pairs that X can decay into.

So the first thing I need to determine is what fermions can X decay into. Since X is a boson, when it decays, it would produce a fermion-antifermion pair. The possible decay modes depend on the mass of X and the masses of the fermions.

Wait, but what's the mass of X? 6 GeV. So the possible fermion pairs must have a combined rest mass less than 6 GeV. Because in particle physics, for a particle to decay into two particles, the sum of their rest masses must be less than the mass of the original particle.

Wait, but wait, that's not entirely correct. Because when a particle decays, the energy and momentum are distributed. The condition is that the rest mass of each fermion must be less than X's mass divided by 2, because each fermion must have energy at least equal to their rest mass. Wait, actually, the correct
