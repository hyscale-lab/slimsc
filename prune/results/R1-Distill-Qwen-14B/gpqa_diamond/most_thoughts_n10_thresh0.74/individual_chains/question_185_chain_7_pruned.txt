Alright, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the eigenvalues of a Hamiltonian operator. Hmm, okay, let's see. The Hamiltonian is given as H = ε σ · n, where σ is the Pauli vector and n is a unit vector. I remember that the Pauli matrices are σ_x, σ_y, σ_z, and they have some properties, like being traceless and having eigenvalues ±1 when multiplied by some factors.

Wait, the Pauli matrices themselves have eigenvalues of ±1, right? But here, they are multiplied by ε and a unit vector. Oh wait, the operator is H = ε times the dot product of σ and n. The dot product σ · n would be a matrix, because σ is a vector of matrices. So σ · n = n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z. Each Pauli matrix is 2x2, so this is a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ε.

I need to find the eigenvalues of H. Remember that for any 2x2 matrix, the eigenvalues can be found using the trace and determinant. Alternatively, since H is proportional to a Pauli matrix, maybe there's a shortcut.

Pauli matrices have the property that σ · n has eigenvalues ±1. Because n is a unit vector, the magnitude of the vector is 1. So, the matrix σ · n would have eigenvalues +1 and -1. Then, when we multiply by ε, the eigenvalues would be scaled by ε.

Wait, let me think again. The Pauli matrices are traceless, and σ · n is
