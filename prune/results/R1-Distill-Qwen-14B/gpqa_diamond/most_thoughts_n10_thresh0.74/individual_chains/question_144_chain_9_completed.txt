Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through. I remember that decay distance has something to do with the particle's lifetime and its velocity. Oh right, the mean decay distance is how far the particle travels before it decays. 

The problem gives me the production energy E_X as 8 GeV, the mass m_X as 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X as 320 MeV. I need to find the mean decay distance. 

Wait, I remember the formula for decay length is something like c multiplied by the lifetime (τ) multiplied by the velocity (βc). So decay distance L = βcτ. But how do I find τ?

Oh, right! The mean lifetime τ is related to the decay width Γ. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle tells us that Γ is inversely proportional to τ. The relation is Γ = ħ / τ, so τ = ħ / Γ. But wait, units are going to be tricky here. I need to make sure everything is in consistent units.

Let me jot down the steps:
1. Convert all given energies into appropriate units.
2. Calculate the lifetime τ using τ = ħ / Γ.
3. Find the velocity β of the meson using its energy and mass.
4. Compute the decay distance L = βcτ.

Wait, let's break it down. First, the energy E is given as 8 GeV. The mass m is 1.2 GeV. Since E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2, I can solve for p, the momentum.

So, E = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2 ). Rearranging, (pc)^2 = E^2 - (m c^2)^2. Then p = sqrt( (E^2 - m^2 c^4) ) / c. Hmm, but maybe it's easier to express in terms of beta and gamma. I recall that E = γ m c², and p = γ β m v, but v is beta c.

Wait, another approach: for a relativistic particle, the energy E can be expressed as E = γ m c². The momentum p is γ β m v = γ β m c² / c. Because E = γ m c² and p = γ β m v, and v = β c. So p = γ β m c² / c = gamma beta m c.

Alternatively, beta can be expressed in terms of E and m. Let me think. Since E = γ m c², and gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - beta²), so beta = sqrt(1 - (m c² / E)^2 ). But wait, let's compute beta as (p c^2) / E. Or, since p = E / (c^2) * beta, because E = gamma m c² and p = gamma m beta c. So p = (gamma m c) beta, so E = gamma m c². So beta = (p c) / (E), since p c = gamma m c² beta. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Alternatively, for non-relativistic particles, but wait, 8 GeV is much higher than 1.2 GeV, so it's definitely relativistic. So, gamma would be E/(m c²). Let's calculate gamma first. E is 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV. So gamma = 8 / 1.2 ≈ 6.6667. So gamma is about 6.6667.

Then, using the relativistic relation, gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta^2). So beta^2 = 1 - (1/gamma^2). Let's compute that. 1/gamma^2 is 1/(44.444) ≈ 0.0225. So beta^2 is 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. So beta is sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887. So beta is about 0.989, which is close to the speed of light.

So the velocity v is approximately 0.989 c. So, beta is ~0.989.

Now, compute tau. Tau is ħ / Γ. But I need to convert the width Γ into units compatible with ħ. Let's see: ħ is in J·s, but Γ is given in MeV. So I need to convert Γ to J.

Wait, but perhaps I can use natural units for calculation and then convert units at the end. Hmm. Alternatively, I can use the formula in terms of GeV and natural units.

Wait, in natural units (c=1, ħ=1), the decay width Γ is in GeV, and the mean lifetime tau would be in inverse GeV. But since we need it in seconds, I think we need to convert properly.

So, let me get this straight. The Planck constant ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. Because 1 GeV = 1e9 eV, and 1 eV is 1.6e-19 J. But perhaps it's easier to use the conversion factor ħ ≈ 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s.

Yes, because 1 GeV = 1.602×10^-10 J. So ħc is about 197 MeV·fm, but maybe that's another topic.

So, Γ is given as 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. So, τ = ħ / Γ ≈ (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / 0.32 GeV = (6.582e-25 / 0.32) s ≈ 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Wait, let me compute that: 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = let's see, 6.582 / 0.32 = approx 20.56875. So 20.56875e-25 s = 2.056875e-24 s.

Now, beta is about 0.989, as computed earlier. The speed of light c is about 3e8 m/s.

So the decay distance L = beta * c * tau.

Plugging in the numbers:

L = 0.989 * 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.

Let me compute that step by step.

First, 3e8 m/s times 2.056875e-24 s is (3e8)*(2.056875e-24) = (3 * 2.056875) * 1e8 * 1e-24 = 6.170625e-16 m.

Then multiply by beta (0.989):

6.170625e-16 * 0.989 ≈ 6.108e-16 m.

Wait, wait, that's about 6.1e-16 meters. But looking at the options:

Options are A) 5.0223e-16 m, B)4.0655e-15, C)5.0223e-15, D)4.0655e-16.

Hmm, none of them are around 6e-16. So maybe I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation of beta. Let me redo that part.

Gamma is E/(m c²), but in natural units where c=1, E is given in GeV, mass m is 1.2 GeV, so gamma = 8 /1.2 = 6.6666667.

So, beta squared is 1 - (1/gamma^2) = 1 - (1/(44.4444)) ≈ 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775.

So beta is sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887, which is about 0.989. Hmm, that seems right.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the 3e8 times 2.056875e-24? Let me compute that again.

3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = 3e8 * 2.056875e-24 = (3 * 2.056875) x 1e8 * 1e-24 = 6.170625e-16 m.

Wait, then multiply by beta 0.989: 6.170625e-16 * 0.989 ≈ 6.108e-16 m.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of tau.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the units when calculating tau. Let me double-check.

Gamma is given as 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. So using tau = ħ / Gamma.

But what's ħ in GeV·s? I think it's 6.582 x10^-25 GeV·s.

So tau = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = approx 2.056875e-24 seconds. That seems right.

Wait, but maybe I should be using the meson's rest frame? No, because tau is the proper lifetime, and decay length is in the lab frame, so the calculation is correct.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of beta. Let me recalculate beta more accurately.

Gamma is 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 6.6666667.

Beta squared is 1 - (1/gamma^2) = 1 - (1/( (8/1.2)^2 )) = 1 - ( (1.2/8)^2 ) = 1 - (0.15)^2 = 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775.

So beta is sqrt(0.9775). Let me calculate that more accurately.

sqrt(0.9775) = let's see, 0.9887? Let me compute 0.9887 squared: 0.9887^2 = (0.98 + 0.0087)^2 ≈ 0.98² + 2*0.98*0.0087 + (0.0087)^2 ≈ 0.9604 + 0.0171 + 0.00007569 = 0.97757569, which is a bit higher than 0.9775. So maybe beta is approximately 0.9886.

Wait, let me compute 0.9886^2: 0.9886 * 0.9886.

Let me compute step by step:

0.9886 squared:

= (0.98 + 0.0086)^2

= 0.98^2 + 2 * 0.98 * 0.0086 + (0.0086)^2

= 0.9604 + 0.017176 + 0.00007396

= 0.9604 + 0.017176 = 0.977576 + 0.00007396 ≈ 0.97764996.

Wait, but our target was 0.9775, so perhaps beta is a little lower than 0.9886. Let me compute 0.9885.

0.9885^2: (0.9885)^2 = ?

Let me compute 9885 * 9885:

But that's tedious. Alternatively, 0.9885 is 0.988 + 0.0005.

So (0.988 + 0.0005)^2 = 0.988^2 + 2 * 0.988 * 0.0005 + (0.0005)^2.

0.988^2 is (0.98^2) + (0.008^2) + 2*0.98*0.008.

Wait, 0.988^2 = (988/1000)^2 = (988^2)/(1e6). 988^2 is (1000-12)^2 = 1e6 - 24e3 + 144 = 1,000,000 -24,000 +144= 976,144. So 0.988^2 = 0.976144.

Then, 2 * 0.988 * 0.0005 = 2 * 0.988 * 0.0005 = 0.988 * 0.001 = 0.000988.

Then, (0.0005)^2 = 0.00000025.

So total is 0.976144 + 0.000988 = 0.977132 + 0.00000025 ≈ 0.97713225.

But we're looking for beta^2 = 0.9775. So 0.97713225 is lower than 0.9775. So perhaps the beta is around 0.9885 or maybe a bit higher.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use more precise calculation. Let me use a calculator-like approach.

We need to find x where x² = 0.9775.

Let me approximate.

x = sqrt(0.9775) ≈ ?

We know that 0.988² is 0.976144, which is less than 0.9775. 0.9885² is about 0.977132, as above. So the square is 0.977132 at x=0.9885. The target is 0.9775, which is 0.000368 higher.

The derivative of x² is 2x. So, delta_x ≈ (0.000368)/(2 * 0.9885) ≈ 0.000368 / 1.977 ≈ approx 0.000186.

So x ≈ 0.9885 + 0.000186 ≈ 0.988686. So beta is approximately 0.988686, which is about 0.9887.

So beta is approximately 0.9887, which I think is accurate enough.

So, L = beta * c * tau.

Beta is 0.9887, c is 3e8 m/s, tau is 2.056875e-24 s.

So compute L:

0.9887 * 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.

Let's compute 3e8 * 2.056875e-24 first: 3 * 2.056875 = 6.170625; 1e8 * 1e-24 = 1e-16.

So that's 6.170625e-16 m.

Then multiply by 0.9887: 6.170625e-16 * 0.9887 ≈ ?

6.170625 * 0.9887 ≈ approximately 6.170625 * 0.9887.

Let me compute that:

6.170625 * 0.9887 = ?

Well, 6 * 0.9887 = 5.9322.

0.170625 * 0.9887 ≈ 0.170625 * 1 = 0.170625; subtract 0.170625 * 0.0113.

0.170625 * 0.0113 ≈ 0.001935.

So 0.170625 - 0.001935 ≈ 0.16869.

So total is 5.9322 + 0.16869 ≈ 6.1009.

So the product is approximately 6.1009e-16 m.

Wait, but looking at the options, the closest I see is option A:5.0223e-16 m and option D:4.0655e-16 m. Hmm. My calculation is about 6.1e-16 m, but none of the options match that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the decay width or something else.

Wait, another thought: maybe I should use the relativistic expression for the mean lifetime. Because the particle is moving, its lifetime in the lab frame is gamma times the proper lifetime. Wait wait, no. The proper lifetime is tau (as we calculated), the lifetime in the lab frame is gamma tau, but no, wait. Wait, tau is the mean proper lifetime, so in the lab frame, the lifetime is gamma tau because the particle is moving. So wait, so the decay length is beta gamma c tau?

Wait wait, no, wait. Decay length is L = v * tau_lab, where tau_lab is the lifetime as observed in the lab frame. Since tau_lab = gamma tau. So L = v * gamma tau.

But v = beta c, so L = beta c gamma tau.

Wait, wait, wait. Let me get that straight. The proper lifetime is tau, so in the lab frame, which sees the particle moving, the lifetime is longer by a factor gamma: tau_lab = gamma tau.

So the decay distance L = v * tau_lab = beta c gamma tau.

Wait, but earlier I used L = beta c tau. Oh! So I think I made a mistake here. I forgot to multiply by gamma.

So the correct formula is L = beta c gamma tau.

Oh, that changes everything. So previously, I used L = beta c tau, but I should have multiplied by gamma as well.

So, let me recalculate.

Earlier, I have tau = 2.056875e-24 s.

Gamma is about 6.6667.

So L = beta * c * gamma * tau.

Compute beta * gamma: 0.9887 * 6.6667 ≈ 6.6 (since 6.6667 * 0.9887 ≈ 6.6).

So, 6.6 * c * tau.

c is 3e8 m/s, tau is 2.056875e-24 s.

So, 6.6 * (3e8 m/s) * (2.056875e-24 s) = 6.6 * (3e8 * 2.056875e-24) = 6.6 * (6.170625e-16 m) = approx 4.0726e-15 m.

Wait, approximately 4.07e-15 meters.

Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, and option C is 5.02e-15. So 4.07e-15 is very close to option B.

But let me compute more accurately.

Compute beta * gamma: 0.9887 * 6.6666667.

Let me compute 0.9887 * 6.6666667.

6.6666667 is 20/3. So 0.9887 * (20/3) = (0.9887 * 20)/3 = 19.774 /3 ≈ 6.5913.

So beta * gamma ≈ 6.5913.

So L = beta gamma c tau.

So 6.5913 * (3e8 m/s) * (2.056875e-24 s).

Compute 3e8 * 2.056875e-24 = 6.170625e-16 m.

Multiply by 6.5913: 6.170625e-16 * 6.5913 ≈ ?

Compute 6.170625 * 6.5913 ≈ let's see:

6 * 6 =36, 0.170625 *6=1.02375.

6 * 0.5913=3.5478; 0.170625 *0.5913≈0.1009.

Wait, perhaps an easier way: 6.170625 *6.5913.

Let me compute 6 *6.5913=39.5478.

0.170625 *6.5913 ≈ 1.121.

Wait, 0.170625 *6 = 1.02375; 0.170625 *0.5913≈0.1009. So total is 1.02375 + 0.1009 ≈1.12465.

So total is 39.5478 + 1.12465 ≈40.67245.

So 6.170625 *6.5913 ≈40.67245.

So 40.67245e-16 m = 4.067245e-15 m.

Which is approximately 4.067e-15 m.

Looking back at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, which is very close. So that's our answer.

So the correct answer is option B.


To determine the mean decay distance \( L \) of the meson resonance \( X \), we use the formula:

\[
L = \beta \gamma c \tau
\]

where:
- \( \beta \) is the velocity of the particle in units of the speed of light,
- \( \gamma \) is the Lorentz factor,
- \( c \) is the speed of light (\( 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \)),
- \( \tau \) is the mean proper lifetime of the particle.

### Step 1: Calculate \( \tau \)
The mean proper lifetime \( \tau \) is related to the decay width \( \Gamma \) by:

\[
\tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma}
\]

Given \( \Gamma = 320 \, \text{MeV} = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \) and \( \hbar \approx 6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV·s} \), we compute:

\[
\tau = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-25}}{0.32} \approx 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}.
\]

### Step 2: Calculate \( \gamma \) and \( \beta \)
The Lorentz factor \( \gamma \) is given by:

\[
\gamma = \frac{E}{m c^2}
\]

where \( E = 8 \, \text{GeV} \) and \( m = 1.2 \, \text{GeV} \). Substituting:

\[
\gamma = \frac{8}{1.2} \approx 6.6667.
\]

The velocity \( \beta \) is related to \( \gamma \) by:

\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}}
\]

Substituting \( \gamma = 6.6667 \):

\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{(6.6667)^2}} = \sqrt{1 - 0.0225} = \sqrt{0.9775} \approx 0.9887.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate \( L \)
The mean decay distance is:

\[
L = \beta \gamma c \tau
\]

Substituting \( \beta \approx 0.9887 \), \( \gamma \approx 6.6667 \), \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), and \( \tau \approx 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s} \):

\[
L = 0.9887 \cdot 6.6667 \cdot (3 \times 10^8) \cdot (2.056875 \times 10^{-24}).
\]

First, calculate \( \beta \gamma \):

\[
\beta \gamma = 0.9887 \cdot 6.6667 \approx 6.5913.
\]

Next, calculate \( c \tau \):

\[
c \tau = (3 \times 10^8) \cdot (2.056875 \times 10^{-24}) = 6.170625 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{m}.
\]

Finally, calculate \( L \):

\[
L = 6.5913 \cdot 6.170625 \times 10^{-16} \approx 4.067 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}.
\]

### Step 4: Match with the closest option
The calculated decay distance \( L \approx 4.067 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \) is closest to option **B) \( 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \)**.

Answer: B
