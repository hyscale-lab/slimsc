Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again.

The question is about a reaction where ((2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxy)benzene is reacted with hydrogen bromide (HBr). Then, after some time, the researcher checks the TLC and sees that the reactant spot has diminished, and two new spots have formed. The question is asking which of the given options could be the structures of the products.

Hmm, I remember that when alkenes react with HBr, they typically undergo an addition reaction, probably following the mechanism of either acid-catalyzed (like Markownikoff addition) or perhaps some other pathway. But wait, the starting material is an allyl ether attached to a benzene ring. So the structure is something like benzene-O-(CH2CH(CH2CH3)CH2), but wait no, waitâ€” let me visualize it again.

Wait, the starting compound is ((2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxy)benzene. So the butenyl group is attached via the oxygen. The structure of the butenyl is 2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl. So the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4? Wait, but butenyl is four carbons. Let's count: the substituent is but-3-en-1-yl. So position 3 is the double bond. So the structure is CH2-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2? Wait, no. Wait, but-3-en-1-yl: the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4. Wait, but butenyl is four carbons. So 1, 2, 3, 4. So the double bond is between 3 and 4. So the structure is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2? No, wait. Wait, structure of but-3-en-1-yl is CH2CH2CH=CH? No, wait, but where are the substituents? Wait, the but-3-en-1-yl is CH2CH2CH2CH2? No, perhaps it's CH2CH-CH2CH2? Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, but-3-en-1-yl would be
