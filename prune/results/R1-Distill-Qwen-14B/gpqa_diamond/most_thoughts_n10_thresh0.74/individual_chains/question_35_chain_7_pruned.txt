Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about the intrinsic angular momentum operator, specifically the Y-component, denoted as A_y. Hmm, I remember that angular momentum operators in quantum mechanics are related to Pauli matrices or something similar. Let's see what the question says.

The problem states that the operator A_y is represented by a 2x2 matrix, which is given as c multiplied by S. The constant c is h/(4π), where h is probably Planck's constant. The matrix S has the first row as (0, -i) and the second row as (i, 0). Wait, that looks familiar. Oh right, that's the Pauli Y matrix multiplied by i, maybe? Or perhaps it's similar to another matrix.

Wait, the Pauli Y matrix is usually given as [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. Oh wait wait, no, the standard Pauli matrices are σ_x, σ_y, σ_z. Let me recall—σ_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], σ_y is [[0,-i],[i,0]], and σ_z is [[1,0],[0,-1]]. Oh, so the matrix S here is exactly σ_y. So S equals σ_y.

So, A_y = c * S = (h/(4π)) * σ_y. Now, the task is to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A_y. Also, among the options provided, I need to pick the correct statement about the process.

The eigenvalue equation is A_y φ = a φ, where a is the eigenvalue and φ is the eigenvector. Since A_y is a 2x2 matrix, it should have two eigenvalues.

First, let's find the eigenvalues. For a 2x2 matrix [[a, b],[c, d]], the eigenvalues λ satisfy the equation (a - λ)(d - λ) - bc = 0. 

So, let me construct the matrix A_y. Since S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]], multiplying by c = h/(4π), we get:

A_y = [[0, (-i)*(h/(4π))], [i*(h/(4π)), 0]]

So, the matrix is:
[ [0, -i (h/(4π)) ],
  [i (h/(4π)), 0 ] ]

Let me denote c = h/(4π) for simplicity. So the matrix is:

[ [0, -i c],
  [i c, 0 ] ]

The eigenvalues are found by solving det(A_y - a I) = 0.

So, subtracting a from the diagonal elements gives the matrix:

[ [-a,  -i c],
  [i c, -a ] ]

The determinant is (-a)(-a) - (-i c)(i c) = a² - ( (-i c)(i c) )

Wait, compute (-i c)(i c) = (-i)(i) c² = (i^2)(-1) c²? Wait, no. Let's compute (-i)*(i) = -i^2. Since i^2 = -1, this becomes -(-1) = 1.

So (-i c)(i c) = (i^2)*(-1) c² ? Wait, maybe I should compute it step by step. (-i)(i) is (-i^2) = -(-1) = 1. So the product is (1) * c^2. Therefore, the determinant becomes a² - ( ( -i c ) * (i c ) )

Wait, wait, the term is ( -i c ) * ( i c ). So that's (-i)(i) c^2. Let me compute (-i)(i) = -i^2 = -(-1) = 1. So the term is 1 * c^2.

So determinant equation: a² - ( ( -i c ) * (i c ) ) = a² - (1 * c²) = 0.

So a² = c².

Thus, a = ±c.

But wait, c is h/(4π), so a = ± h/(
