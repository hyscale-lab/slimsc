Okay, so I've got this problem about stellar abundances, and I need to find the ratio of silicon atoms in two stars. Hmm, let me think through this step by step. 

First, I remember that when astronomers talk about [X/Y] notation, it's the logarithm of the ratio of the number densities of two elements X and Y compared to the Sun. So [X/Y] = log10(nX/nY) - log10(nX/nY)_sun. 

The problem gives me some values for Star_1 and Star_2. Let's list them out. 

For Star_1:
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex. So that means the ratio of Si to Fe in Star_1 is 10^(0.3) times that in the Sun.
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex. So the ratio of Fe to H in Star_1 is the same as in the Sun.

For Star_2:
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex. So Mg/Si is 10^0.3 times solar.
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex. So Mg/H is the same as solar.

Wait, but I need to find the ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 and Star_2. So [Si/Star_2_Si] = [Si in Star_1] / [Si in Star_2]. 

But wait, the problem says "the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2." So I think that's (n_Si,1 / n_Si,2). 

But let me think about how to get n_Si for each star.

I have the Sun's composition: 
- log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 - 12? Wait, wait. The problem says 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5. So log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5. So nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5). 

Similarly, log10(nMg/nH) is 7.5 -12 gives me log10(nMg/nH)=7 -12= -5? Wait wait, wait. Let me read that again. 

Wait
