Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particles colliding in a detector. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let's see if I can work through it.

So the setup is that particles are collided at the center of a spherical detector. When they collide, new particles are produced, and these new particles are moving at ultra-relativistic speeds with a Lorentz factor of about 20. On average, one third of these particles reach the inner walls of the detector. The radius of the detector is 30 meters. The question is asking what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of the particles reach the inner walls instead.

Wait, okay, so right now, with a Lorentz factor of 20, only one third make it, but we want two-thirds to reach. So I guess the particles are decaying or something and some are not making it to the walls. So the longer they live, the more likely they'll reach the wall.

I remember that for particles moving at relativistic speeds, their lifetime is dilated due to time dilation. The proper time (the lifetime in the particle's rest frame) multiplied by the Lorentz factor gamma gives the time experienced in the lab frame. So the lab frame sees the particle's lifetime as longer by gamma.

So the particles are produced at the center, and they have to travel a certain distance before decaying. The maximum distance they can travel is their lifetime multiplied by their speed. But since they're ultra-relativistic, their speed is approximately the speed of light, c.

So the distance they can travel before decaying is approximately gamma * c * tau, where tau is the proper lifetime.

Wait, but the problem says that on average, one third reach the walls. So maybe when gamma is 20, the average distance they travel is about 30 meters multiplied by something. Because the detector's radius is 30 meters, right?

Wait, wait. The particles are produced at the center, so the maximum distance they can travel to reach the inner walls is 30 meters. So the question is about the time it takes for them to reach the wall. The ones that reach the wall are the ones that don't decay before traveling that distance.

So the fraction that reach the walls depends on the product of their speed and their lifetime. But since they're ultra-relativistic, v ≈ c, so the time they have is distance divided by speed, which is roughly 30 meters / c.

Wait, but the lifetime in the lab frame is gamma * tau. So for a particle to reach the wall, the lifetime must be longer than the time it takes to reach the wall. So the probability that the particle doesn't decay before traveling 30 meters is the probability that its lifetime is longer than (30/c). Hmm, but decay is a Poisson process, I think. So the mean lifetime is gamma tau, so the average lifetime is gamma tau.

Wait, but the number that reach the wall is the ones who live long enough. The average number that reach is given by the exponential decay function. So the probability that a particle hasn't decayed by time t is exp(-t/(gamma tau)), right?

So the time t they take to reach the wall is 30 meters / (v). But since they are ultra-relativistic, v is approximately c. So t ≈ 30/(c). So the probability that they haven't decayed by that time is exp(-(30/c)/(gamma tau)).

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. The problem states that on average, one third reach the walls when gamma is 20. So, that would mean that the probability P is 1/3 when gamma is 20.

So, let's formalize this. Let me denote the proper lifetime as tau. The mean lifetime in the lab frame is gamma * tau.

The mean lifetime is the average time before decay. The probability that a particle hasn't decayed after time t is P(t) = exp(-t/(gamma tau)).

Wait, but since they are moving at velocity v≈c, the time t is L/v ≈ L/c, where L is the distance to the wall, which is 30 meters.
