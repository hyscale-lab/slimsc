Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because it's a bit complex, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read it again carefully.

The problem says that an equimolar mixture of salts A and B, weighing 7.20 grams, was heated to 200°C without air. This caused a mixture of gases to form. The gases were passed through several tubes: first, anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2, then Ca(OH)2 solution, and finally red-hot copper. The results were: tube 1 gained 3.60 grams, tube 3 gained 0.80 grams (producing CuO), and tube 2 didn't change. Finally, 2.24 liters of gas C remained at standard temperature and pressure (STP). The question is asking for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B.

Hmm, okay. So the setup involves a decomposition reaction of the salts upon heating, producing gases. The gases are then passed through various chemical traps. Let me think about what each of these tubes does.

Mg(ClO4)2 is a strong drying agent and can react with water vapor. So tube 1 probably absorbs any water vapor in the gas mixture. The gain of 3.60 grams here suggests that the mass of the absorbed water is 3.60 grams. Wait, but wait—Mg(ClO4)2 would react with H2O. Each Mg(ClO4)2·nH2O would form, but I'm not sure about the exact stoichiometry. Alternatively, maybe it's capturing water as the anhydrous form absorbs it, but the mass gained is the mass of water. So perhaps 3.60 g is the mass of H2O in the gas.

Moving on. Tube 2 is Ca(OH)2 solution. It probably absorbs CO2. If the weight didn't change, that means no CO2 was present in the gas mixture. So the gases didn't have carbon dioxide. So maybe the gases are something else, like maybe H2O and another gas.

Then tube 3 is red-hot copper. Red-hot copper would react with certain gases. For example, it reacts with H2O when in the form of steam, but wait, no, wait. Wait, I'm a bit confused. Red-hot copper in tube 3 would react with CO or maybe with H2O under certain conditions. Wait, another thought: if the gas is H2O vapor, then in the presence of red-hot copper, it might not react, but maybe if the gas is O2 or another oxidizing agent, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the gas is SO2 or something else. Wait, maybe another approach.

The final gas C after all these tubes is 2.24 liters at STP. STP is 1 mole per 22.4 liters, so 2.24 L is 0.1 moles. So gas C is 0.1 moles.

Wait, let me try to outline what each tube does. Tube 1 is Mg(ClO4)2, which absorbs H2O. So any water vapor in the gas is captured here, and the gain is 3.
