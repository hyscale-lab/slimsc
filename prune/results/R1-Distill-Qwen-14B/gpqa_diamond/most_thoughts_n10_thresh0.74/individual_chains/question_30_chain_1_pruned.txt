Okay, so I have this question about a textile dye and the light it emits. Hmm, the question says the dye has an extensively conjugated pi-electron system and emits light with an energy of 2.3393 eV. I need to find out what color it absorbs.

Wait, I remember that when a compound absorbs certain wavelengths of light, it emits others. Oh right, the complementary color! Because when something emits light, the color we see is the one it doesn't absorb. Or wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. Let me think.

So, the energy of the emitted light is given. I think the energy of the absorbed light is higher than the emitted because the molecule gets excited to a higher energy state and then drops down, emitting the difference. Oh wait, the energy of the absorbed photon must be higher than the emitted. Because when a molecule absorbs a photon, it gains energy, then when it relaxes, it emits a photon of lower energy.

So the energy of the absorbed light is higher than 2.3393 eV. But wait, the question is about the color of the absorbed light. So I need to find the wavelength corresponding to 2.3393 eV, and then determine the complementary color.

Wait, to find the wavelength, I can use the equation E = hc/λ. Let me compute that. H is Planck's constant, which is approximately 6.626 x 10^-34 J·s. C is speed of light, 3.00 x 10^8 m/s. But since energy is given in eV, maybe I should use the conversion where
