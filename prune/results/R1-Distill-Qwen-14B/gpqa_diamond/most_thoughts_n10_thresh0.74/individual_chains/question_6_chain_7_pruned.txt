Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still trying to wrap my head around these concepts. But let's take it step by step. The question is about finding the energy spectrum of a particle in a specific potential in two dimensions. The potential is given as V(r,θ) = (1/2) k r² + (3/2) k r² cos²(θ). Hmm, wait, that looks a bit complicated, but maybe I can break it down.

First, I remember that in quantum mechanics, when dealing with potentials, it's helpful to separate variables if possible. Since the potential depends on r and θ, perhaps I can express it in polar coordinates and see if it's separable into radial and angular parts.

Looking at the potential, I see it's V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ. Let me factor out r² to see it better. So, V(r,θ) = r² [ (1/2)k + (3/2)k cos²θ ] = (k r² / 2) (1 + 3 cos²θ). Hmm, interesting. Wait, maybe I can separate this into a function that depends only on r and another that depends on θ.

Wait no, because the potential is not just a sum of functions of r and θ. For example, if the potential were V(r) + W(θ), then it would be separable. But here, both terms involve r² multiplied by functions of θ. So that complicates things a bit.

Wait, but maybe I can think of this as a sum of two terms. Let me see: V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ. So that's V(r) = (1/2) kr², which is a simple harmonic oscillator potential in two dimensions. But then there's an additional term: (3/2)k r² cos²θ. Hmm, how does that affect the system?

Wait, perhaps I should think about the angular part. The potential depends on cos²θ. I remember that in polar coordinates, when the potential has angular dependence, sometimes you can use separation of variables in the Schrödinger equation. But wait, in this case, the potential is V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ. So let me write it as:

V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² [1 + 3 cos²θ ]

Hmm, that looks a bit like a perturbation to the simple harmonic oscillator potential. But wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Alternatively, perhaps I can make a substitution for θ.

I know that cos²θ can be written using a double-angle identity: cos²θ = (1 + cos(2θ))/2. Let me plug that in. So substituting, we have:

V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² [1 + 3*(1 + cos(2θ))/2 ]

Let me compute the constants inside. 3*(1/2) is 3/2, and 3*(cos(2θ)/2) is (3/2) cos(2θ). So,

V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² [1 + 3/2 + (3/2) cos(2θ) ].

Adding 1 and 3/2 gives 5/2. So,

V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² * (5/2) + (1/2)k r² * (3/2) cos(2θ).

Wait, perhaps I can factor out (1/2)k r²:

V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² [5/2 + (3/2) cos(2θ)].

Hmm, but that's not particularly helpful. Alternatively, perhaps I can write the potential as the sum of two terms: one that's purely radial and another that's angular-dependent.

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let me consider the entire Hamiltonian. The Hamiltonian for a particle in 2D polar coordinates is:

H = (-ℏ²/(2m)) (1/r ∂/∂r (r ∂/∂r) + 1/(r²) ∂²/∂θ² ) + V(r,θ).

Substituting the given V(r,θ), we get:

H = (-ℏ²/(2m)) (1/r ∂/∂r (r ∂/∂r) + 1/(r²) ∂²/∂θ² ) + (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ.

Hmm. Let me try to separate the variables. Let's assume that the wavefunction can be written as ψ(r,θ) = R(r) Y(θ). Then, the Schrödinger equation would be Hψ = Eψ.

Substituting ψ into H, we get:

[ (-ℏ²/(2m)) (1/r d/dr (r dR/dr) / R ) + (1/(r²) d²Y/dθ²) / Y ) ] + V(r,θ) = E.

Wait, but V(r,θ) is [ (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ ].

So when I plug ψ = R(r) Y(θ), V becomes [ (1/2)k r² Y(θ) R(r) ) + (3/2)k r² cos²θ Y(θ) R(r) ) ].

Wait, but that's not going to separate neatly because each term in V depends on both r and θ. So perhaps my initial approach is wrong. Maybe there's another way to look at this potential.

Wait, let me think. The potential is V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ. Let me factor out the r²:

V(r,θ) = (k r²) [ (1/2) + (3/2) cos²θ ].

Hmm. So that's (k r²) [ (1 +3 cos²θ)/2 ].

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I can write this as:

V(r,θ) = (k r²) [ (1/2) (1 + 3 cos²θ) ]

So, that's (k r² /
