Okay, so I've got this problem about finding the partition function for a system of three spins. Each spin can be either +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J(S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). Hmm, I remember that the partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of the exponential of (-beta times energy), right?

Wait, beta is 1/(kT), so each term in the sum is exp(-E/(kT)) which is exp(beta E). So for each state, I calculate the energy and then multiply by the exponential.

Each spin S can be +1 or -1. So there are 2^3 = 8 possible states in total. I need to list all possible combinations and calculate their energies.

Alternatively, maybe I can find a smarter way rather than enumerating all 8 states. Because for three spins, each can be +1 or -1, the possible values of the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 will determine the energy.

Let me think about the possible values of that sum. Let's denote H = S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3.

Each term S_i S_j is either +1 or -1. So the sum H can be 3, 1, -1, or -3. Because each term is +/-1. So if all three terms are +1, H=3. If two are +1 and one -1, H=1. If one +1 and two -1, H= -1. And all three -1, H=-3.

Wait, wait. Let me check:

If S1, S2, S3 are all +1: then each S_i S_j is +1, so H=3.

If two are +1 and one -1: let's say S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1. Then S1S2=1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1. So H=1-1-1= -1. Hmm, that's H=-1. Wait, that's different from what I thought earlier. So maybe my initial assumption about the possible values was wrong.

Wait, maybe I should think about all possible combinations.

Let me take all 8 states and calculate H for each.

1. S1=1, S2=1, S3=1:
H = 1*1 + 1*1 + 1*1 = 3.

2. S1=1, S2=1, S3=-1:
H = 1*1 + 1*(-1) + 1*(-1) = 1 -1 -1 = -1.

3. S1=1, S2=-1, S3=1:
H = 1*(-1) +1*1 + (-1)*1 = -1 +1 -1 = -1.

4. S1=1, S2=-1, S3=-1:
H = 1*(-1) +1*(-1) + (-1)*(-1) = -1 -1 +1 = -1.

5. S1=-1, S2=1, S3=1:
H = (-1)*1 + (-1)*1 +1*1 = -1 -1 +1 = -1.

6. S1=-1, S2=1, S3=-1:
H = (-1)*1 + (-1)*(-1) +1*(-1) = -1 +1 -1 = -1.

7. S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=1:
H = (-1)*(-1) + (-1)*1 + (-1)*1 = 1 -1 -1 = -1.

8. S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=-1:
H = (-1)*(-1) + (-1)*(-1) + (-1)*(-1) = 1 +1 +1 =3.

Wait, looking at all 8 states, H can be 3 or -1. Only two possible values. So in the first state and the last state (all +1 or all -1), H is 3. In all other 6 cases, H is -1. So how many states have H=3? Two. And H=-1 occurs in 6 states.

Wait, that can't be right because when I enumerate, only two states have H=3 and the other six have H=-1. So the energy in each case would be E = -J * H.

So E for H=3 is E = -J*(3) = -3J.

For H=-1, E = -J*(-1) = J.

So now, the partition function Z is the sum over all states of exp(beta E), where beta=1/(kT).

So each state contributes exp(beta E) term. Since all states with the same E have the same energy, we can group them.

Number of states with E=-3J: 2 (as H=3 occurs twice). Each contributes exp( beta*(-3J) ) = exp(-3J beta).

Wait no, wait: because E is the energy of the state. So for each state, the term is exp( -E/(kT) ) = exp( beta E ) since beta=1/(kT).

So E = -3J: term is exp( beta*(-3J) ) = e^(-3J β).

Wait no: Wait, E is given, and the exponent is -beta E. So for E=-3J, the exponent is -beta*(-3J) = 3J beta. So the term is e^{3J beta}.

Wait, wait: wait, the partition function is Z = sum_{n} exp( -beta E_n ), where E_n is the energy of state n. So each state contributes exp( -beta E_n ).

So for E = -3J, the term is exp( beta *3J ), because 3J is positive.

Wait, no: Let me clarify this. The energy for each state is E = -J H.

So when H=3, E = -3J.

So the partition function is sum exp( -beta E ) = sum exp( beta *3J ) for the two states where E=-3J.

Similarly, for the other six states, E=J, so each contributes exp( -beta J ), which is exp( -J beta ).

Wait, but wait, when H=-1, E = -J*(-1) = J.

So the term is exp( -beta J ), because J is positive if J is positive. But wait, J is a coupling constant, so I think J is positive. So the term is e^{-J beta} for each of the six states.

So to compute Z:

Z = 2 * e^{3 J beta} + 6 * e^{- J beta}.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is Z=2 e^{-3 J β} +6 e^{J β}, which is the opposite of what I have here.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the sign. Let me go back: E = -J (S1 S2 + S1 S3 + S2 S3). So H is the sum.

H = S1 S2 + S1 S3 + S2 S3.

So for the state where all spins are
