Okay, so I've got this question about planets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, let's see. I need to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2. Both are orbiting the same star, and I have some data about them. 

First, I remember that the equilibrium temperature of a planet is given by the formula:

Te = T_star * sqrt(R_star / (2a)) * ( (1 - albedo) )^0.5

Wait, but wait, the formula might be a bit different. Oh right, the general formula for a planet's equilibrium temperature is Te = T*( (L / (16πσ a² (1 - α)) ) )^0.25, but since both planets orbit the same star, maybe I can simplify it.

Wait, the star's luminosity comes into play here. The star's luminosity (L) is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR_star²σTeff^4. So, since both planets are around the same star, their L is the same. So maybe I can express the equilibrium temperature ratio in terms of their orbital distances.

The equilibrium temperature formula can be rearranged for each planet, and since L and T_eff of the star are the same for both, the ratio of Te (Planet1/Planet2) would depend on their distances from the star.

Wait, but wait, how do I find the orbital distances? Oh, because the question gives information about the RV method. The Doppler shift relates to the velocity of the star due to the planet's orbit. The shift tells us about the velocity, which can be used with Kepler's third law to find the planet's orbital period and semi-major axis.

So the RV method gives the velocity semi-amplitude, K. The formula for K is K = (v*sin i) = ( (G(M_star) )^(1/3) * (M_planet sin i) ) / ( (P * (1 + M_planet/M_star))^(2/3) * (2π)^(1/3) ) )

But wait, I'm not sure about the exact formula. Alternatively, I think the semi-amplitude K is given
