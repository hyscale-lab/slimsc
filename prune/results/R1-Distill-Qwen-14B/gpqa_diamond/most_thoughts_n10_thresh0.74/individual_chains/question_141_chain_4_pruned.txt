Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again carefully.

The question says: 1-bromobenzene-2-d is treated with NaNH2 in condensed ammonia solvent. How many possible organic products are there in this reaction?

Hmm, wait, 1-bromobenzene-2-d? Oh, wait, that must be a typo. Maybe it's 1-bromo-2-dimethylbenzene or something. Wait, benzene with a substituent at position 1 and another at position 2? No, wait, perhaps the 'd' stands for something else. Oh, wait, sometimes the 'd' is used to denote a specific isomer, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene or another substitution pattern. Wait, perhaps it's 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene. Let me think about that.

Wait, the structure of benzene with substituents at positions 1 and 2 would be adjacent, so the substituents are para to each other? Wait no, positions 1 and 2 are adjacent, so they are meta in a way? Wait no, benzene is a six-membered ring, so numbering goes 1, 2, 3 around. Positions 1 and 2 are adjacent, so substituents in positions 1 and 2 would be adjacent (ortho) to each other.

Wait, but the compound is 1-b
