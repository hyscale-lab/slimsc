Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure out the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) when the speed of the nucleus is 0.96c. Hmm, I remember from my studies that relativistic speeds involve some special relativity concepts. Let me think.

The nucleus in question is X, which is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium, right? So the standard lithium nucleus has 3 protons. If it has 3 neutrons, then its isotope must be Li-6 because 3 protons + 3 neutrons equals 6 nucleons. So the mass number A is 6.

So the nucleus is a Li-6 nucleus. I need to calculate its relativistic energy when moving at v=0.96c. The energy in special relativity is given by the total energy formula, which is gamma times the rest energy. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, and the rest energy is mc².

The formula for gamma is 1 divided by the square root of (1 minus v squared over c squared). Let me write that down: gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Since v is 0.96c, let's plug that in.

v = 0.96c, so v² = (0.96)^2 c². Let me compute 0.96 squared. 0.96 * 0.96 is 0.9216. So v²/c² is 0.9216. Then 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. So sqrt(0.0784) is the square root of 0.0784. Hmm, what's that? Let me think. 0.28 squared is 0.0784, right? Because 0.28 * 0.28 is 0.0784. So sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28. Therefore, gamma is 1 / 0.28. Let me compute that. 1 divided by 0.28 is approximately 3.5714. Wait, wait, let me do that division again. 0.28 times 3 is 0.84, 0.28*3.5 is 0.98, 0.28 *3.5714 is about 1. So yeah, 3.5714 is about 25/7, because 25 divided by 7 is approximately 3.5714.

Wait, but maybe I should compute this more accurately. Let me check: 25/7 is actually approximately 3.57142857. So yeah, that's correct. So gamma is approximately 3.5714.

Now, the rest energy is mc². But what's the mass m of the Li-6 nucleus? The mass of a nucleus can be found using the mass number. The atomic mass unit (u) is approximately 1.660539 ×10^-27 kg. So m = 6 u, since A=6 for Li-6. Wait, no, wait. The mass number is 6, but the actual mass is a bit less than 6u due to the mass defect, but in this context, are we considering the rest mass as simply 6u? Hmm, maybe for the purpose of this problem, the mass is taken as the rest mass of the nucleus, which is approximately 6u. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the molar mass and convert it into kg?

Wait, another approach: the rest mass energy can be calculated using the formula E = m c². But m is the rest mass. For a nucleus with mass number A, the rest mass is approximately A times the mass of a proton (or neutron), but I think for this purpose, the exact value isn't needed, but maybe we
