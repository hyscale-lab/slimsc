Okay, so I've got this chemistry question here about isomers and tautomerism and optical isomerism. I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to think it through step by step.

The question says that compounds with the same molecular formula but different structures are isomers. There are two types: constitutional and stereoisomers. Constitutional are different in structure, stereoisomers have the same structure but different spatial arrangements, like in the case of cis-trans or optical isomers.

The question has two parts, A and B.

Part A: Among benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, which doesn't show tautomerism.

Hmm, tautomerism is when a compound can shift a hydrogen and a lone pair, changing the structure but not the molecular formula. For example, in ketones and aldehydes, if there's an alpha hydrogen, they can tautomerize, like between keto and enol forms.

Wait, but wait. Benzoquinone is a quinone, which I think is a cyclic structure with two ketone groups. Benzoquinone has two ketone groups opposite each other on the benzene ring. Now, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is a six-membered ring with three ketone groups, one at each of the 1,3,5 positions. So it's a symmetric structure.

Do they undergo tautomerism? Let me think. Tautomerism requires the presence of a hydrogen adjacent to a carbonyl group because the hydrogen can shift, right? So, for a compound to show tautomerism, it should have an alpha hydrogen (a hydrogen attached to a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group).

Benzoquinone: Each carbonyl is on the benzene ring. The ring has double bonds, so I'm not sure if there are alpha hydrogens. Wait, benzene is a ring of six carbons, each with a double bond structure. The quinone part is O with double bonds. So, in benzoquinone, each ketone is at a position where the adjacent carbons are part of the ring. Are there hydrogens attached to those adjacent carbons?

Let me visualize benzoquinone. For example, para-benzoquinone would have two ketone groups opposite each other on the benzene ring. So the structure is O=C6H4=O. Wait, no, actually, the structure is more like O=C-C6H2
