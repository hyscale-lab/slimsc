Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. Let me try to break it down step by step. Okay, I remember that in a 1D infinite potential well, the energy levels are quantized. The formula for the energy levels is E_n = (n² π² ħ²) / (2mL²), right? And the question gives E as pi² ħ²/(2mL²), so E is actually the ground state energy for n=1. So E1 = E, E2 would be (2²) E =4E, E3 is 9E, and so on.

Wait, but the problem says there are four identical spin-1/2 particles. Oh, right, identical particles with spin-1/2 are fermions, so they must obey the Pauli exclusion principle. That means each quantum state can hold only a certain number of particles, based on their spin and spatial wavefunction symmetry.

In a 1D box, the spatial wavefunction is either symmetric or antisymmetric. But for fermions, the total wavefunction must be antisymmetric. Since spin-1/2 particles have spin states that can be symmetric or antisymmetric, the spatial part must have the opposite symmetry. So, for each spatial state, if the spin part is symmetric, the spatial part must be antisymmetric, and vice versa.

But wait, in a 1D system, the spatial wavefunction for a particle in state n is ψ_n(x), which is a sine function. For two particles, if their spatial wavefunction is symmetric or antisymmetric? Hmm. Let me think: For two identical particles, the spatial wavefunction is symmetric if they have the same spin state. But wait, since they're spin-1/2, two particles can have a singlet state (antisymmetric spin) or a triplet (symmetric spin). 

But wait, in this case, the particles are in the same potential well, so the spatial wavefunction must be considered. For fermions, the total wavefunction is antisymmetric. So, the product of the spatial and spin parts must be antisymmetric. 

But perhaps a simpler approach is to think about how many particles can occupy each energy level in the spatial part. For two particles in the same spatial state, their spins must be different. But in a 1D box, each spatial state can hold two fermions with opposite spins.

Wait, no, each distinct spatial state can have two fermions because spin-1/2 allows for two possible spin states (up and down). So for each n, you can have two particles.

So, for four particles, let's think about the filling of the energy levels.

Ground state: The lowest energy is E1. Since each state can hold two particles, E1 can have two particles. So when the system is in the ground state, two particles are in n=1, and the other two will go to higher energy levels.

But wait, wait. Because the particles are fermions, their total wave
