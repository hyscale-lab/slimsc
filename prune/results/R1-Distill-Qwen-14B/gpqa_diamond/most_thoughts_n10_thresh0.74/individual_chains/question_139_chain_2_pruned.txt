Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about figuring out the starting materials A and B that, when treated with hydrochloric acid, sodium nitrite, and water, produce two different diketones. Hmm, I remember that certain reactions form ketones from other functional groups.

Wait, the reagents mentioned are HCl, NaNO2, and water. Oh right! That sounds like the Stephen reduction or maybe the formation of a carbonyl group from a nitro compound. Or wait, no, wait. Oh! I think HNO2 with HCl is involved in the hydrolysis of nitro compounds. Or maybe it's the Beckmann rearrangement? No, Beckmann uses oximes and acid. Wait, another possibility: the formation of a ketone from a secondary amine? Or perhaps it's about diazonium salts.

Wait, wait. Diazonium salts! Oh right, when amines react with HNO2, they form diazonium salts, especially aromatic amines. But wait, I'm not sure if that's relevant here because the products are diketones, which are carbonyl compounds. Maybe the starting materials have something that can form a carbonyl upon treatment.

Wait, another thought. I remember that when alcohols are treated with HCl, NaNO2, and water, especially under certain conditions, they can form ketones. Oh wait! That's the Stephen reduction. But wait, the Stephen reduction is for converting nitroalkanes to ketones. Or is it for the oxidation of alcohols? No, that's not right. Alternatively, maybe it's about the oxidation of alcohols to ketones, but under what conditions?

Wait, another reaction comes to mind: The use of HNO2 and HCl with secondary alcohols. Oh, wait! Maybe it's the formation of a carbonyl group from a secondary alcohol via the hydroxylamine pathway. Wait, no, hydroxylamine is more for forming oximes. Alternatively, wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think: what reaction forms a ketone from an alcohol with HCl and NaNO2?

Oh! I think I remember now. When a secondary alcohol is treated with a strong acid like HCl and sodium nitrite (HNO2), it can form a nitro compound, which upon hydrolysis gives a ketone. So, the process is like the oxidation of a secondary alcohol to a ketone, but I'm not exactly sure about the mechanism. Alternatively, perhaps it's the production of a diazonium salt which then rearranges or decomposes to form a carbonyl group.

Wait, another angle: the reagents HCl, NaNO2, and H2O. I recall that this combination is used in the production of nitro compounds from alcohols. For example, a secondary alcohol can react with nitrous acid (HONO) generated from NaNO2 and HCl to form a nitro compound, which then may undergo some rearrangement or elimination to form a carbonyl group.

Oh wait! I think the reaction is as follows: secondary alcohols reacting with HONO (nitrous acid) under acidic conditions can form a nitroso compound, which then could rearrange. Alternatively, perhaps it's the formation of an N-nitrosamine, but that's more for amines. Hmm.

Wait, another thought
