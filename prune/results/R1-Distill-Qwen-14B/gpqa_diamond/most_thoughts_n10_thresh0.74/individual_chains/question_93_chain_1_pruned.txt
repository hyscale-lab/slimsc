Okay, so I've got this question about qPCR here. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. Let's read the question carefully.

The scientist is making a calibration curve for qPCR. He used a positive control with known copy numbers and diluted it serially. He ran three technical replicates for each concentration. The efficiency was 100%, which I remember means the reaction is perfect—each cycle doubles the DNA. R² was 1, so the data fits perfectly, right? And the slope was -3.3. Wait, wait, the slope in qPCR is usually negative because as the concentration increases, Ct decreases. Oh, right, because higher starting amounts reach the threshold sooner.

Looking at the data: the Ct values for each concentration. Let's see. Let's take the 100000 copies per µl. The Ct values are 33.9, 34.2, 34.5. So the average is about 34.2, and the standard deviation is around 0.3. Similarly, the other concentrations have Cts decreasing by about 3.3 each time. For example, from 100000 (Ct ~34) to 10000 (Ct ~30.6), that's a difference of roughly 3.6. Wait, but the slope was -3.3. Hmm, maybe that's the key.

Wait, the slope in the qPCR curve is calculated based on the log of the concentration versus Ct. The formula is slope = ln(10) * log10(e) * (1 - efficiency). But since efficiency is 100%, that's 1, so (1-1)=0. Wait, no, that can't be right. Oh wait, more accurately, the efficiency E is (each cycle doubles the DNA). So for E=100%, the efficiency is 1, so the formula for the slope in the linear equation (Ct = slope * log(target) + intercept) is slope = -1/(log10(E)). Since E=1, log10(1)=0, which would make the slope undefined. Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing up the formulas.

Wait, the standard formula for the slope is -3.3219 if the efficiency
