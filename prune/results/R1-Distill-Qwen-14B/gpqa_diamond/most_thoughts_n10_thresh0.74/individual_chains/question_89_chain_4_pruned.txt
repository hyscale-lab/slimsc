Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a shot.

The question is about a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Let's see what each step does.

First Reaction: Heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with excess KOH at 240°C. The product is a light yellow solid, product 1. The NMR and IR spectra are given. The IR has a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, which I remember is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. That suggests a ketone or maybe an ester or aldehyde. But looking at the NMR, there's a triplet at 4.79 ppm (2H). Hmm, 4.79 is upfield for a triplet. Maybe those are adjacent to an oxygen, like in an alcohol or ether. But considering the IR, it's more likely a carbonyl. Wait, if it's a ketone, maybe it's an enol or something else. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation, forming an alkene. But then, why the IR peak at 1720? Oh wait, maybe elimination isn't the case here. 

Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Heating with KOH... that's a strong base. So perhaps it's undergoing an elimination. But with two bromines, maybe it's a di-elimination? Or maybe a substitution? Or maybe it's a Hofmann elimination? Alternatively, considering the structure, adamantane has a diamondoid structure, and 1,3-dibromo... so when KOH is added, perhaps each Br is replaced by an OH. Wait, but that would make 1,3-diol adamantane. But that doesn't explain the IR. Alternatively, maybe it's an E2 elimination, forming an alkene. But with two leaving groups, perhaps two eliminations occur, forming a diene?

Wait, looking at the NMR. The triplet at 4.79 ppm for 2H. That could be a CH₂ group adjacent to something. If it's an alcohol, like an -O-CH₂- group. But the IR peak at 1720 is more likely for a carbonyl. Wait, when KOH is used
