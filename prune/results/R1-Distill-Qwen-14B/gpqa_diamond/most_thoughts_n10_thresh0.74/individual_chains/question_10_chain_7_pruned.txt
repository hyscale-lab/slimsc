Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and their densities. Hmm, I need to figure out which one has the highest density. Let me think about what I remember from my classes.

The question gives four options, a to d, each describing a planet with certain characteristics. The options are labeled as A to D, which correspond to the choices. Wait, no, wait. The options for the answer are A, B, C, D, each pointing to one of the a to d choices. So I need to figure out which a, b, c, or d is the correct answer, and then pick the corresponding letter.

The question is about density. Density is mass divided by volume, right? So for each planet, I need to calculate or compare their densities.

Let me go through each option one by one.

Option a is an Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet. Well, Earth's density is about 5.5 g/cm³, I think. So this planet should have the same density as Earth.

Option b is a planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³. Wait, but they already told us the density here. So this one has a density of 5.5, same as Earth. So same as a's density?

Wait a minute, no. Let me think again. Because density is mass over volume. If the planet has 2 Earth masses, but what about the radius? Oh wait, no, option b doesn't specify the radius, but the question says "a planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5." So they're directly telling us the density here. So this planet's density is 5.5.

Option c is a planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive. So same composition would mean same density, right? Because density depends on the material it's made of. So if it's five times Earth's mass but same composition, its radius would be larger because volume scales with radius cubed, but mass scales with radius to the third power times density. Wait, no, because if density is same, then mass is proportional to volume, which is proportional to radius cubed. So Earth's mass is M, this planet's mass is 5M. So radius would be cube root of (5) times Earth's radius. Cube root of 5 is about 1.7, so radius would be larger.

But since density is same as
