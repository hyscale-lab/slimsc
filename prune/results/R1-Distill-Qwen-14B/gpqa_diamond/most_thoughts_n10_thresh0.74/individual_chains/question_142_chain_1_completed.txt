Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is.

The question gives a density matrix ρ and asks about its geometrical position in the qubits space. The options are A to D, each with different r coordinates. Hmm, I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's in a mixed state. So, pure states are represented by density matrices that are projectors (like |ψ⟩⟨ψ|), and mixed states are combinations of these.

The given density matrix is ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). Wait, that looks familiar. It's a diagonal matrix with 1/2 on the diagonal. Let me write it out in matrix form to make it clearer. For a qubit, the computational basis states are |0⟩ and |1⟩. The density matrix in 2x2 form would be:

ρ = (1/2) * [[1, 0],
             [0, 1]]

Because |0⟩⟨0| is [[1,0],[0,0]] and |1⟩⟨1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. Adding them gives [[1,0],[0,1]], and then multiplied by 1/2, so each diagonal element is 1/2 and off-diagonal are zero.

Wait, but in qubit space, I think the density matrices are represented in a Bloch sphere representation. Oh right, the Bloch sphere is a geometric way to represent qubit states. A pure state is on the surface of the sphere, and mixed states are inside. The density matrix of a pure state has trace 1 and rank 1. For a mixed state, the trace is still 1, but the rank can be higher.

So the given ρ has trace 1 (since 1/2 + 1/2 = 1) but it's a diagonal matrix with two non-zero eigenvalues, each 1/2. So it's a mixed state, specifically a completely mixed state for a qubit. I remember that the completely mixed state for a qubit is (I/2), where I is the identity matrix. So this ρ is exactly that.

But how does this translate into the Bloch sphere coordinates? Oh, right! The Bloch vector representation. Any 2x2 density matrix can be written in terms of the Pauli matrices. The general form is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices, and r is a vector in 3D space (the Bloch vector), with components r_x, r_y, r_z. The magnitude of r must be ≤1 because the density matrix must be positive semi-definite.

Let me expand that. The Pauli matrices are σ_x = [[0,1],[1,0]], σ_y = [[0,-i],[i,0]], σ_z = [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So,

ρ = (I + r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z ) / 2.

Given our ρ is (I)/2, because (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2 is the same as I/2. So, I/2 = (I + r·σ)/2. Subtract I/2 from both sides, I think. Wait, let me write it:

I/2 = (I + r·σ)/2.

Multiply both sides by 2:

I = I + r·σ.

Subtract I from both sides:

0 = r·σ.

So r·σ must be the zero matrix. The only way this is possible is if r is the zero vector. Because any non-zero r would make at least one of the components non-zero, thus the matrix r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z would not be zero.

Therefore, the Bloch vector r is (0,0,0). So the geometrical position is at the origin.

Looking at the options:

Option C is (0,0,0). So the answer should be C.

Wait, but just to make sure. The completely mixed state is in the center of the Bloch sphere. That makes sense because it's completely uncertain; you can't distinguish any direction, so it's at the origin. Yep, that seems right.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

In matrix form, this is:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

This is a diagonal matrix with eigenvalues \( \frac{1}{2} \) and \( \frac{1}{2} \), indicating it represents a mixed state. Specifically, this is the completely mixed state for a qubit, which corresponds to the identity matrix scaled by \( \frac{1}{2} \), i.e., \( \rho = \frac{I}{2} \).

In the Bloch sphere representation, any density matrix can be expressed as:

\[
\rho = \frac{I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}}{2},
\]

where \( \boldsymbol{\sigma} \) are the Pauli matrices, and \( \mathbf{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z) \) is the Bloch vector. Comparing this with the given \( \rho = \frac{I}{2} \), it is evident that \( \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} = 0 \), which implies \( \mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0) \). This means the density matrix corresponds to the origin in the Bloch sphere, representing the completely mixed state.

Among the options provided:

- **A)** \( r = (1, 1, 0) \): Incorrect, as this corresponds to a pure state on the Bloch sphere.
- **B)** \( r = (0, 0, 1) \): Incorrect, as this corresponds to a pure state along the \( z \)-axis.
- **C)** \( r = (0, 0, 0) \): Correct, as this corresponds to the completely mixed state at the origin of the Bloch sphere.
- **D)** \( r = (1, 1, 1) \): Incorrect, as this corresponds to a pure state outside the Bloch sphere.

Thus, the geometrical position of the density matrix in the qubit space is \( r = (0, 0, 0) \).

Answer: C
