Okay, so I have this physics problem here about an electron and a positron colliding and producing two photons. Hmm, I remember that when particles annihilate, they produce photons, usually gamma rays. The setup is that an electron is moving left along the horizontal axis with a Lorentz factor of 4, and a positron is moving right with a Lorentz factor of 2. After they collide, they annihilate into two photons with the same energy. One photon goes upper-right, the other lower-right. I need to find the angle between them.

Wait, Lorentz factors. The Lorentz factor gamma is the factor by which time and length dilate for moving objects. For an electron and positron, their rest masses are the same, right? So their relativistic energies would depend on their gamma factors. The total energy before collision should equal the total energy after.

So, the electron has gamma_e =4, and the positron gamma_p=2. The rest mass of an electron (and positron) is m, so their energies are gamma * m c^2.

So the total energy before collision is (4m + 2m)c^2 = 6m c^2.

After annihilation, two photons are produced, each with energy E. Since they have the same energy, each photon has E = 3m c^2. Because 2E =6m c^2 → E=3m c^2.

Wait, but that would mean each photon has energy 3m c^2. Wait, but photons carry momentum as well. The momentum of a photon is E/c, and its direction matters.

The system before collision: the electron is moving to the left (let's say negative x-direction) with gamma=4, so its momentum is gamma * m * v. Wait, no, for relativistic momentum, p = gamma m v. Alternatively, since gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2), and v is the velocity. But maybe it's easier to use the fact that for a particle, E^2 = (pc c)^2 + (m c^2)^2. So for the electron: E_e =4 m c^2. So (p_e c)^2 = (4 m c^2)^2 - (m c^2)^2 = 16 m² c^4 - m² c^4 =15 m² c^4 → p_e c = sqrt(15) m c² → p_e = sqrt(15) m c.

Wait, but direction matters. The electron is moving left, so let's take that as negative x-direction. So p_e = -sqrt(15) m c.

Similarly, the positron has gamma_p=2. So E_p = 2 m c². For momentum, E_p² = (p_p c)^2 + (m c²)^2 → (2 m c²)^2 = (p_p c)^2 + m² c^4 →4 m² c^4 = (p_p c)^2 + m² c^4 → (p_p c)^2 =3 m² c^4 → p_p c = sqrt(3) m c² → p_p = sqrt(3) m c.

The positron is moving right, so positive x-direction. So p_p = sqrt(3) m c.

So total momentum before collision is p_total = p_e + p_p = (-sqrt(15) m c) + (sqrt(3) m c) = [sqrt(3) - sqrt(15)] m c. Wait, sqrt(3) is about 1.732, sqrt(15) is about 3.872, so sqrt(3) - sqrt(15) is negative, about -2.14. So the total initial momentum is negative, which means it's directed to the left.

After collision, the two photons must carry away momentum in such a way that the total momentum is the same. Also, since the photons are moving in the upper-right and lower-right directions, their directions are both in the right half-plane, but one is above the x-axis and the other is below.

Let me denote the two photons as Photon 1 and Photon 2. Photon 1 goes upper-right with some angle θ above the x-axis, and Photon 2 goes lower-right with angle θ below the x-axis. Wait, but the problem says one is upper-right and the other lower-right. So perhaps their angles are symmetric with respect to the x-axis. But not necessarily. Because their energies are the same, but their directions could vary.

Wait, but each photon has energy E =3 m c². So each photon's momentum is p_photon = E/c =3 m c² / c =3 m c.

Since momentum is a vector, and the two photons have energies equal. So the momenta are vectors with magnitude 3 m c each, but in different directions.

So the sum of their momenta must equal the initial total momentum before collision, which was [sqrt(3) - sqrt(15)] m c ≈ [1.732 -3.872] m c ≈ -2.14 m c.

Let me compute the vectors. Let me model this in a coordinate system where x is the horizontal axis. Momentum vectors are in 2D.

Photon 1: Let's assume it's moving at an angle θ above the x-axis. Its momentum components are p1x = 3 m c cosθ, p1y =3 m c sinθ.

Photon 2: It's moving at an angle φ below the x-axis. So p2x =3 m c cosφ, p2y = -3 m c sinφ.

The total momentum after collision is the vector sum of these two.

So total x-momentum: (3 m c cosθ +3 m c cosφ) =3 m c (cosθ + cosφ).

Total y-momentum: (3 m c sinθ -3 m c sinφ) =3 m c (sinθ - sinφ).

But the initial momentum was [sqrt(3) - sqrt(15)] m c in the x-direction (since p_e was negative and p_p positive, but the net was negative). There was no initial y-momentum, so the total y-momentum after must be zero.

Wait, that's a key point. Before collision, since both particles are moving along the x-axis, their y-momentum is zero. Therefore, the total y-momentum after collision must be zero.

So:

3 m c (sinθ - sinφ) =0 → sinθ = sinφ.

Which implies either φ=θ, or φ= π - θ (since sine is symmetric about π/2). But since one photon is upper-right and the other is lower-right, their angles are symmetric with respect to the x-axis. So θ = -φ. Wait, no. Let me think. Maybe θ is the angle above the x-axis, and φ is the angle below. So sinθ = sinφ, but θ is positive, φ is negative. So θ = -φ. So, for example, if θ is 30 degrees above, φ is 30 degrees below.

But wait, another possibility is that θ = π - φ. Let me consider that. If θ= π - φ, then sinθ = sin(π - φ) = sinφ. But in this case, the angles would add up to π. But that would place one photon going up and the other going to the left, which is not the case here. So the correct scenario is that θ = -φ, but I'm not sure about the exact relationship.

Wait, the sum of y-components must be zero. So 3 m c sinθ -3 m c sinφ =0 → sinθ = sinφ.

So either φ = θ + 2π n, which isn't possible since angles in different directions, or φ = π - θ + 2π n. Let me consider φ = π - θ. But since one is above and the other is below, their angles would be θ and -θ, but sinθ = sin(-theta) is false. Because sin(-theta) = -sin theta. So that would make sin(theta) = sin(phi) → sin(theta) = sin(-theta) → only possible if sin(theta) =0, which would mean theta=0, but that's along the x-axis, which doesn't fit the photon directions. So perhaps another approach is needed.

Alternatively, maybe the two angles are symmetric with respect to the x-axis, so θ = -φ. But then sin(theta) = - sin(phi), which would make the sum sin(theta) - sin(phi) = sin(theta) + sin(theta) = 2 sin(theta). For this to be zero, sin(theta) must be zero, which would imply theta=0 or pi, which again wouldn't fit the scenario of upper and lower directions. Hmm, this is confusing.

Wait, perhaps I made a wrong assumption about the angles. Suppose instead that the two photons have angles θ above and below the x-axis, but their sines are equal. Then phi could be -theta, but then sin(theta) = -sin(phi), which would require that the sum sin(theta) - sin(phi) = sin(theta) - (-sin(theta)) = 2 sin(theta) =0. Hence, sin(theta)=0, which would imply theta=0. But that's along the x-axis, which can't be the case because the photons are moving in upper-right and lower-right directions, so their angles can't be zero. Hmm, this suggests that perhaps the only solution is that both photons are moving along the x-axis, but that's not the case as per the problem statement.

Wait, maybe I'm making a mistake here. Let me re-express the condition. The sum of the y-components must be zero. So:

3 m c [sin(theta) - sin(phi)] =0 → sin(theta) = sin(phi)

But the photons are moving in opposite y-directions. So one has positive y-component, the other negative. So sin(theta) = sin(phi), but their y-components are opposite. So sin(theta) = - sin(phi). Because, for example, if Photon 1 is at angle theta above the x-axis, then its y-component is positive. Photon 2 is at angle phi below, so its y-component is negative. So the sum is sin(theta) + |sin(phi)| =0 → sin(theta) = - sin(phi). 

Wait, let me clarify. The y-component of Photon 1 is p1y = 3 m c sin(theta), positive. Photon 2's y-component is p2y = -3 m c sin(phi), negative. The sum is 3 m c [sin(theta) - sin(phi)] =0 → sin(theta) = sin(phi) ?

Wait, no, wait. Because p2y is -3 m c sin(phi), so the total y-momentum is p1y + p2y = 3 m c [sin(theta) - sin(phi)] =0.

So:

sin(theta) = sin(phi)

But the photons are moving in opposite y-directions. So if Photon 1 is at angle theta above the x-axis, Photon 2 must be at an angle phi below, so their sines would have opposite signs. Wait, no, because sin(theta) is positive for theta above, and sin(phi) would be positive for phi above. So if theta is in the upper-right, phi is in the lower-right, so phi is negative. So sin(phi) would be negative.

Wait, perhaps I should model phi as a negative angle. So let me denote Photon 1 has an angle theta (positive) above the x-axis and Photon 2 has an angle -phi (negative) below the x-axis.

So, their y-components are:

p1y = 3 m c sin(theta)

p2y =3 m c sin(-phi) = -3 m c sin(phi)

So the sum is:

3 m c (sin(theta) - sin(phi)) =0 → sin(theta) = sin(phi)

But since phi is in the lower half, sin(phi) = - sin(theta). So sin(theta) = - sin(phi) → sin(theta) = - (- sin(theta)) → sin(theta) = sin(theta). Hmm, that doesn't help.

Wait, perhaps I should model Photon 2's angle as phi = - theta. Let me see. Suppose Photon 2 is at angle theta below the x-axis, so phi = - theta. Then their sines are sin(theta) and sin(-theta) = - sin(theta). So the sum becomes:

3 m c [sin(theta) - (- sin(theta))] = 3 m c [2 sin(theta)] =0 → sin(theta) =0 → theta=0. Which again brings us to the conclusion that they're moving along the x-axis, which contradicts the problem statement. 

Hmm. There's a contradiction here. The only way the sum of y-components is zero is if each photon's y-component cancels the other. But that requires that for the two photons, p1y = - p2y. Which would mean that the sines of their angles are equal in magnitude but opposite in sign. So sin(theta) = - sin(phi). But if one is above and the other below, their sines are negatives. So theta and phi can be theta and -theta. But if that's the case, then their y-components would cancel.

Wait, that makes sense. So let me model Photon 1 as having an angle theta above the x-axis, and Photon 2 having an angle -theta below. Then sin(theta) = sin(-theta) → no, sin(theta) = - sin(theta) → only possible if sin(theta) =0. Which again leads to theta=0, which is along the x-axis. So this scenario can't happen unless the photons are moving along the same line, which they aren't.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me think again. The sum of the y-components must be zero. So:

p1y + p2y =0 → (3 m c sin(theta)) + (3 m c sin(phi)) =0 → sin(theta) + sin(phi) =0 → sin(phi) = - sin(theta → phi = -theta, or phi= pi + theta. But if phi=pi + theta, then the angles would be in opposite quadrants. For example, if theta is 30 degrees above, phi would be 210 degrees, which is below the x-axis. But that would place Photon 2 moving to the left, which contradicts the problem statement that both are moving to the right. So the only possibility is phi = -theta. But then their sines are negatives, so sum to zero.

Wait, but then if phi = -theta, then their x-components would be cos(theta) and cos(-theta) → cos(theta) and cos(theta), because cosine is even. So the x-components would both be positive, meaning both photons are moving to the right, which aligns with the problem statement.

Wait, but if Photon 1 is moving at theta above and Photon 2 is moving at -theta below, that makes sense. So their x-components are both positive, and their y-components are opposite. So their sum in y is zero, which fits.

So, the two photons have angles theta and -theta, which means their y-components cancel.

Now, their x-components:

p1x =3 m c cos(theta)

p2x =3 m c cos(-theta) =3 m c cos(theta)

So total x-momentum after collision is (3 m c cos(theta) +3 m c cos(theta))=6 m c cos(theta).

But the initial x-momentum was [sqrt(3) - sqrt(15)] m c. So:

6 m c cos(theta) = [sqrt(3) - sqrt(15)] m c.

Divide both sides by m c:

6 cos(theta) = sqrt(3) - sqrt(15).

Compute the RHS: sqrt(3) is about 1.732, sqrt(15) is about 3.872. So sqrt(3) - sqrt(15) ≈ 1.732 -3.872 ≈ -2.14.

So 6 cos(theta) = -2.14 → cos(theta) = -2.14 /6 ≈ -0.3567.

So theta ≈ arccos(-0.3567). Let me compute this. Arccos(-0.3567) is in the second quadrant. Cos(110 degrees) is about -0.342, cos(111) is about -0.357. So theta ≈ 111 degrees.

So each photon has angles of 111 degrees and -111 degrees. The angle between them would be 111 - (-111) =222 degrees? Wait, that can't be right because the maximum angle between two lines is 180 degrees. Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the angles.

Wait, no. Because the two photons are at theta and -theta, the angle between them would be 2 theta, but if theta is measured from the x-axis. So, for example, if one photon is at +theta and the other at -theta, the angle between them is 2 theta.

Wait, but when the angle of each photon is measured from the x-axis, the upper one is at theta, the lower one at -theta. The angle between them is the absolute difference between the two angles: theta - (-theta) =2 theta. So the angle between them is 2 theta ≈ 2*111=222 degrees, but that's more than 180, so perhaps the smaller angle is considered, which would be 360-222=138 degrees.

Wait, but the options given are 74, 172, 138, 96. Hmm, 138 is one of them. So the angle between the photons would be 2 theta, but perhaps we should take the smaller angle, which might be 180 - 2 theta? Let me think. Wait, if theta is 111 degrees from the x-axis, then the angle between the two photons would be 222, but since angles are modulo 360, the smallest angle between them would be 138 degrees (360-222=138). So that's the angle between them.

But wait, let me recheck the calculation. The total initial momentum in x-direction was (sqrt(3) - sqrt(15)) m c ≈ (1.732 -3.872) m c ≈-2.14 m c. So after the collision, the total x-momentum is 6 m c cos(theta) = -2.14 m c → cos(theta)= (-2.14)/(6) ≈ -0.3567. So theta is about 111.2 degrees. So each photon is at 111 degrees and -111 degrees.

The angle between them would be the angle between 111 degrees and -111 degrees. Alternatively, the angle from 111 degrees to -111 degrees is 222 degrees, but the smaller angle between them is 138 degrees (since 222 is larger than 180, 360-222=138). So the angle between the two photons is 138 degrees.

Looking at the options, option C is 138, which matches.


To solve the problem, we analyze the collision of an electron and a positron, which annihilate into two photons with equal energy. The electron moves left with a Lorentz factor of 4, and the positron moves right with a Lorentz factor of 2. The goal is to determine the angle between the two photons, which are moving in the upper-right and lower-right directions.

### Step 1: Conservation of Energy
The total energy before annihilation is the sum of the relativistic energies of the electron and positron:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = \gamma_e m c^2 + \gamma_p m c^2 = 4m c^2 + 2m c^2 = 6m c^2.
\]
After annihilation, this energy is converted into the energy of the two photons:
\[
E_{\text{photon 1}} = E_{\text{photon 2}} = \frac{E_{\text{total}}}{2} = 3m c^2.
\]

### Step 2: Conservation of Momentum
The total momentum before annihilation is calculated from the relativistic momentum of the electron and positron:
\[
p_{\text{total}} = p_e + p_p = -\sqrt{15}m c + \sqrt{3}m c = (\sqrt{3} - \sqrt{15})m c \approx -2.14m c.
\]
After annihilation, the photons carry equal energy but in different directions. Let the photons have angles \(\theta\) (upper-right) and \(-\theta\) (lower-right) with respect to the x-axis. The momentum of each photon is:
\[
p_{\text{photon}} = \frac{E}{c} = \frac{3m c^2}{c} = 3m c.
\]
The x- and y-components of momentum for the photons are:
\[
p_{1x} = 3m c \cos\theta, \quad p_{1y} = 3m c \sin\theta,
\]
\[
p_{2x} = 3m c \cos(-\theta) = 3m c \cos\theta, \quad p_{2y} = 3m c \sin(-\theta) = -3m c \sin\theta.
\]
The total momentum after annihilation is:
\[
p_{\text{total, x}} = p_{1x} + p_{2x} = 6m c \cos\theta,
\]
\[
p_{\text{total, y}} = p_{1y} + p_{2y} = 3m c (\sin\theta - \sin\theta) = 0.
\]
Since the total momentum before annihilation is entirely in the x-direction, the total momentum after annihilation must also be in the x-direction:
\[
6m c \cos\theta = (\sqrt{3} - \sqrt{15})m c \implies \cos\theta = \frac{\sqrt{3} - \sqrt{15}}{6}.
\]
Calculating:
\[
\cos\theta \approx \frac{-2.14}{6} \approx -0.3567.
\]
Thus:
\[
\theta \approx \arccos(-0.3567) \approx 111^\circ.
\]

### Step 3: Angle Between the Photons
The two photons are symmetrically placed at angles \(\theta\) and \(-\theta\) relative to the x-axis. The angle between them is:
\[
\Delta\theta = \theta - (-\theta) = 2\theta \approx 2 \times 111^\circ = 222^\circ.
\]
Since angles are periodic modulo \(360^\circ\), the smaller angle between the photons is:
\[
360^\circ - 222^\circ = 138^\circ.
\]

### Final Answer
The angle between the directions of the photons is **138 degrees**.
