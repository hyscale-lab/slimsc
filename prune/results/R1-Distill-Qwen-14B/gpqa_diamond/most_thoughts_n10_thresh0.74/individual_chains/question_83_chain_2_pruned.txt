Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says. Hmm, we have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid, and we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate that solution with 0.1 M NaOH. The question is asking about the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given, and I need to choose the correct one.

Alright, first things first. Let me break down the problem. I think I should start by figuring out the concentrations after dilution. Then, determine what happens during the titration—specifically, at 25% and when the equivalence point is reached.

So, when we dilute the acetic acid with water, the volume increases. The initial volume is 20 cm³, and we add another 20 cm³ of water. So the total volume becomes 40 cm³. Wait, but 20 cm³ is 0.02 liters, right? So the initial moles of acetic acid (CH3COOH) would be Molarity × Volume = 0.05 M × 0.02 L = 0.001 moles.

After diluting, the new volume is 40 cm³, which is 0.04 L. So the new concentration would be moles/volume. So 0.001 mol / 0.04 L = 0.025 M. So the diluted solution is 0.025 M acetic acid. That makes sense.

Now, when we titrate with NaOH, which is a strong base. The reaction between acetic acid and NaOH should be a neutralization reaction. The reaction is: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COONa + H2O. So, each mole of NaOH will neutralize a mole of CH3COOH, producing the acetate ion (CH3COO^-).

At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid will have been neutralized to its conjugate base, acetate. So the solution will be a solution of sodium acetate, which is a salt from a weak acid and a strong base. That means the solution will be basic because the acetate ion will hydrolyze in water to produce OH- ions.

Wait, but to find the pH at equivalence and at 25% titration, I need to calculate these two points.

Starting with the equivalence point. Let's figure out how much NaOH is needed to reach the equivalence point.

The initial moles of acetic acid were 0.001 mol. Since each mole of NaOH neutralizes one mole of acetic acid, the moles of NaOH needed for equivalence would also be 0.001 mol. The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, so volume = moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³.

But wait, the question is about
