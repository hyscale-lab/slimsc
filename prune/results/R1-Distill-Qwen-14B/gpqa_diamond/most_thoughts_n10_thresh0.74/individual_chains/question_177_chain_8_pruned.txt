Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

So, there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, its mass is 1.5 times bigger. Hmm, but wait, the question is about luminosity. Luminosity is about how much light a star emits, right?

The astronomers found that the wavelengths where the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, right, the peak wavelength of a black body's emission is given by Wien's Law. Wien's displacement law says that the peak wavelength λ_max is proportional to 1/T, where T is the temperature. So if both stars have the same λ_max, their temperatures must be the same. Because if λ1 = λ2, then T1 = T2. Because it's inversely proportional.

Wait, so both stars have the same temperature? That's interesting. So their temperatures are equal. So T1 = T2.

Now, the question is about their luminosities. The luminosity of a star as a black body is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR²σT⁴. Oh, right, where R is radius, T is temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.

So L is proportional to R² * T⁴. Since both stars have the same T, the ratio of luminosities will be (R1/R2)² multiplied by (T1/T2)^4. But since T1=T2, that part is 1. So L1/L2 = (R1/R2)².

Wait, R1 is 1.5 times R2. So R1/R2 = 1.5. So squaring that gives (1.5)^2 = 2.25. So L1 should be 2.25 times L2.

Wait, but wait a second. The problem says that the astronomers computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than Star_2 by a factor of the options given. The options are A) ~2.25, B) ~2.32, etc. So according to this, the factor would be 2.25. So option A.

But wait, the question mentions radial velocities. Oh, wait, what
