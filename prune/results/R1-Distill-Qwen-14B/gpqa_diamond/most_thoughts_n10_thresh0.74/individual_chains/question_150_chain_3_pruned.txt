Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm going to try to solve it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. Hmm, that's a bit tricky. Let me think about the degrees of unsaturation. Degrees of unsaturation are calculated as (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Wait, the formula is C8H9NO. So, substituting the values: (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2. Let's compute that. 18 -9 is 9, plus 1 is 10. 10 divided by 2 is 5. So five degrees of unsaturation. That could be a ring plus double bonds or something like that. 

The NMR data is given: 9.72 ppm (t, 1H), 6.98 (d, 2H), 6.51 (d, 2H), 6.27 (bs, 2H), 3.66 (d, 2H). Let's interpret this. 

Looking at the NMR:

- 9.72 ppm triplet (1H). That's a pretty high chemical shift. Could be an aldehyde proton, but aldehydes are usually around 9-10. But wait, sometimes it's an aromatic proton in a specific environment. Alternatively, maybe an acidic proton like -OH, but that's usually broad. Wait, this is a triplet, which suggests coupling with two adjacent protons. Hmm. So maybe it's an aldehyde, but in a conjugated system? Or maybe a vinylogous aldehyde or something else.

Wait, another possibility: an alpha proton to a carbonyl. Or maybe a de-shielded proton, like on a benzene ring. Wait, but 9.72 is more like an aldehyde. Let me think.

Then, 6.98 (d, 2H) and 6.51 (d, 2H). Those look like two sets of doublets that are probably from a para-substituted aromatic ring. Wait, because if you have a para-substituted benzene, the two protons in each pair would be equivalent and give a doublet. So perhaps this is a benzene ring with two substituents, each in the para positions
