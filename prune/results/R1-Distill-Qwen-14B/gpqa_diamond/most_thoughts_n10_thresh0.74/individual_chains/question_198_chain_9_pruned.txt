Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and their stability constants. Hmm, I remember that stability constants, or formation constants, tell us how stable a complex is. The higher the β, the more the complex will form.

The question is asking about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species. The options are A to D, all percentages. Let me see what I remember about this.

So, the solution has Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN^-). The concentrations are c(Co) = 1e-2 M and [SCN^-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants given are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Wait, wait, I need to make sense of the subscripts. I think βn is the formation constant for the complex with n SCN- ligands. So Co(SCN)_1 would have β1=9, Co(SCN)_2 has β2=40, and so on. But wait, β4 is 16? That's lower than β3? That seems a bit odd, but maybe it's correct.

Wait, no, wait. Stability constants usually increase with the number of ligands because each additional ligand adds another layer of stability. But here, β3 is 63, which is higher than β2=40, but β4 is 16, which is lower. Hmm, that's confusing. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the notation. Oh wait, perhaps β4 refers to a different complex, maybe a different oxidation state or a different structure. Or maybe it's a typo, but I'll proceed with what's given.

Wait, the question is about the dithiocyanato complexes, which would have two SCN^- ligands. So that would be Co(SCN)_2^2+ or something like that. The stability constant β2 is 40. But wait, the options are about the percentage of blue complexes. I think the blue color is associated with the Co(SCN)_6^3+ complex, which is the intensely colored one. But wait, the question says dithiocyanato, which is two SCN- per Co. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, I think I need to calculate the distribution of all possible Co(SCN)_n species in solution and then find what percentage the dithiocyanate
