Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, let me think. The question says that the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M, and I need to find the concentration of free calcium ions. Oh wait, the problem gives me the formation constant, K_ca-edta, which is 5x10^10. 

Wait, formation constant... right, that's the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex ion. So the formation reaction would be something like Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ⇌ CaEDTA^2-, and K is given as 5e10. 

So the formula for the formation constant K is [CaEDTA^2-] / ( [Ca²+][EDTA^4-] ). But wait, in this problem, the solution contains the stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. So the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. But wait, what about the other species? I guess I need to find [Ca²+], which is the concentration of free calcium ions.

Wait, but what about the EDTA? Since Ca-EDTA is formed, I suppose that most of the Ca²+ is tied up in the complex. So the free [Ca²+] would be very low because K is large, meaning the reaction favors the formation of the complex.

Let me write down the variables. Let's let [CaEDTA] = 0.02 M. Let me denote [Ca²+] as x. Then, because the reaction is 1:1, the concentration of EDT
