Okay, so I have this problem about calculating the enthalpy of formation of a specific organic compound. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think through it. 

The compound given is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. Wait, that's a mouthful. Maybe I should first draw the structure or at least count the number of each type of bond to apply the bond energy method. 

Wait, the problem gives bond energies for H-H, C-C, C=C, and C-H. Oh, right, the enthalpy of formation can be calculated using the bond energy approach, where you consider the energy released when bonds form and the energy required to break bonds. 

So, the formula for enthalpy of formation (ΔHf) using bond energies is:
ΔHf = (sum of bond energies of reactants) - (sum of bond energies of products)

But wait, wait. No, actually, I think it's the other way around. Because when bonds are broken, you need to put in energy, and when bonds form, energy is released. So for the formation of a molecule from its elements, you have to break the bonds in the reactants (like O2, H2, etc.) and form the bonds in the product. 

Wait, maybe I should think about it this way: the enthalpy of formation is the energy change when a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. So for this problem, the elements are H2 and C (graphite or something).
