Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to find the uncertainty in the operator P_z for a given state. Hmm, let me try to break this down.

First, I remember that the uncertainty in an operator is found using the formula ΔP_z = sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²). Right, so I need to calculate the expectation values of P_z and P_z squared.

The state given is the column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). Let me denote this state as |ψ⟩. The matrix for P_z is given as:

P_z = [[ℏ, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, -ℏ]]

Wait, no, wait. Looking again, the matrix is:

First row: ℏ, 0, 0
Second: 0,0,0
Third: 0,0,-ℏ.

So, it's a diagonal matrix with ℏ, 0, -ℏ on the diagonal. So the eigenstates are the basis vectors, which are the eigenvectors of P_z. So our state |ψ⟩ is written in the basis of P_z's eigenstates.

Wait, but the state is given as a column vector. Let me write that out:

|ψ⟩ = [ -1/2 ]
        [ 1/√2 ]
        [ -1/2 ]

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the state is a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). Oh wait, that's three components. So it's a 3-component vector, which matches the 3x3 matrices given for P_x, P_y, P_z.

So our state is |ψ⟩ = [ -1/2; 1/√2; -1/2 ]

Now, to find the expectation value ⟨P_z⟩, I think I just need to compute ψ† P_z ψ. Since P_z is diagonal, this should be straightforward.

Calculating ⟨P_z⟩:

Each diagonal element is multiplied by the square of the component of |ψ⟩ in that basis. Because when you multiply P_z (diagonal) by |ψ⟩, each term is (diagonal entry) * (corresponding component of |ψ⟩), and then taking the inner product with |ψ⟩.

So:

⟨P_z⟩ = ( (-1/2)^2 ) * ℏ + ( (1/√2)^2 ) * 0 + ( (-1/2)^2 ) * (-ℏ)

Wait, let me compute each term.

First term: component 1: (-1/2) * ℏ * (-1/2): Wait, no, wait. The expectation value is the sum over i of ψ_i * P_z_ii * ψ_i*.

Wait, wait. No, more accurately, each term is ψ_i multiplied by P_z_ii multiplied by ψ_i^*, but since ψ is real here, it's just ψ_i^2 * P_z_ii.

So:

⟨P_z⟩ = ( (-1/2)^2 )
