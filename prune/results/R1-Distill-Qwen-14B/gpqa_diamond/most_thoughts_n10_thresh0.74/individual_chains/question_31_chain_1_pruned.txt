Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm supposed to figure out the molecular symmetry group of the final product. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.

The question says that toluene is treated with nitric acid and sulfuric acid to form product 1. Then, product 1 is treated with MnO2 and H2SO4 to make product 2. Finally, product 2 is treated with acetone and aqueous sodium hydroxide to form product 3. I need to find the molecular symmetry group of product 3.

First, I'll think about each reaction step by step.

Step 1: Toluene with nitric acid and sulfuric acid. Nitric acid is a strong nitrating agent, and sulfuric acid is a catalyst. Toluene undergoes nitration. The nitration of toluene typically occurs at the para position because the methyl group is activating. So product 1 would be para-nitrotoluene. The structure is a benzene ring with a nitro group and a methyl group opposite each other.

Step 2: Product 1 (para-nitrotoluene) is treated with MnO2 and H2SO4. MnO2 is a strong oxidizing agent. In acidic conditions, it usually oxidizes nitro groups. Wait, but para-nitrotoluene has a nitro group attached to the benzene. When oxidized, what happens?

Wait, nitro groups aren't directly the part that gets oxidized. Oh wait, maybe the methyl group is being oxidized? Because in some cases, the methyl group attached to the benzene ring can be oxidized under certain conditions. Like, if it's a methyl group ortho to a nitro group, but wait, in this case, the nitro is para to the methyl. Hmm.

Wait, when a methyl group attached to a benzene ring is oxidized, it can form a ketone. So if the methyl is oxidized, it would become a CO group. But wait, para-nitrotoluene's methyl is in the para position relative to the nitro. So when oxidized, that methyl becomes a ketone. So product 2 would be para-nitrobenzaldehyde? Wait no, wait. Wait, oxidation of methyl group attached to benzene (toluene) would typically go to a carboxylic acid. But here, the starting material is para-methyl nitrobenzene, so oxidizing the methyl
