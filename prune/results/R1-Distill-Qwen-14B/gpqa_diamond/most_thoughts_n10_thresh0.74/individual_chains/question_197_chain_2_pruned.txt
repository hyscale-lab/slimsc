Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm supposed to figure out the product of a reaction between Compound X and red phosphorus with HI. Hmm, alright, I'll take it step by step.

First, let's look at the spectral data provided for Compound X. The IR and NMR data should give me clues about the structure.

Starting with the IR spectrum: The peaks are at 3400–2500 cm⁻¹, which probably indicates O-H stretching. But wait, that's a broad range. Maybe it's an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. Then there's a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹. That's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Carboxylic acids have a strong peak around there, but so do ketones, esters, etc. Also, there's a peak at 1610 cm⁻¹, which might be from aromatic C=C stretching. The 1450 cm⁻¹ could be C-O stretching in an ester, maybe, or something else... Hmm.

Now the NMR data. Let's parse that. The 10.5 ppm peak is a broad singlet (bs) for 1H. That's very high, so likely an -OH proton, maybe from a carboxylic acid. But wait, if it's a carboxylic acid, the OH is usually a broad peak, but in some cases, it might be exchanged and not show up. Alternatively, could it be an aldehyde proton? No, aldehydes are usually around 9-10, but they're deshielded and appear as singlets. But wait, the integration is 1H, so maybe that's an acidic proton, like a carboxylic acid. Wait, but if it's a carboxylic acid, then in the IR, the 1720 cm⁻¹ would fit. So that's a possibility.

Looking at the aromatic region: 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H). That suggests a para-substituted aromatic ring. The doublets with 2H each mean that there are two substituents in the para positions. So maybe a benzene ring with substituents at positions 1 and 4. Wait, but 8.0 is higher than 7.2, so maybe the substituent at position 4 is an electron-withdrawing group, making the protons ortho to it downfield. For example, if it's a nitro group, but the IR doesn't show a nitro peak. Hmm.

Wait, the substituents could
