Okay, I've got this question about optical activity in various compounds. Hmm, optical activity means the compound can rotate plane-polarized light, right? That usually happens when a molecule has a chiral center, which is a carbon atom attached to four different groups.

So I need to go through each compound one by one and check for chiral centers or other factors that cause optical activity. Let me list them out.

1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene
   The structure is CH2-C(Cl)=CH-CH3. Wait, but it's a double bond. For a double bond to have geometric isomerism, it needs substituents on each carbon. Here, the Cl is on C1, and the substituents are CH2Cl, CH(CH3), and two H's? Wait, maybe not. Let me draw it.

   Structure: the molecule is CH2Cl-C(Cl)=CH2? No, wait, 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. Oh, butene is four carbons. So 1-ene means double bond between C1 and C2. So structure is Cl-C=C-CH(CH3)-CH3? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro-2-methyl would be on the first carbon of the double bond.

   Wait, the structure would be Cl attached to the first carbon, which is part of a double bond. So the molecule is Cl-C(=CH2-CH(CH3))?

   Wait, maybe the structure is more like Cl-CH2-C(=CH2)CH3. No, I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps it's CH2Cl-CH2-C(=CH2)CH3? No, wait, but the but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would replace one H on the first carbon. So Cl on the first carbon, and 2-methyl would be a CH(CH3) on the second carbon.

   So the structure is Cl-CH2-C(CH2CH3)=CH2? No, perhaps not. I'm a bit stuck on the structure. But wait, the question is about optical activity, which requires a chiral center. In this case, the molecule has a double bond. Does it have a chiral center? Let's see.

   The first carbon (C1) is Cl attached.
