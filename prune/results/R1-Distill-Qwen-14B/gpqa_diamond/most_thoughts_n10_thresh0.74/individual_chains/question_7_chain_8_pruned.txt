Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about gamma-ray annihilation with CMB photons. Hmm, let's see what the question says. The problem is about the energy of gamma-rays whose lifetime is limited by the process γγ → e+e−. The average photon energy of the CMB is given as 1e-3 eV.

Wait, I remember that when high-energy particles interact with the CMB, their mean free path determines how far they can travel before annihilating. So if a gamma-ray's energy is high enough, it might annihilate with a CMB photon to produce an electron-positron pair.

I think the process here is photon-photon annihilation. So the main thing is to find the energy where the gamma-ray's lifetime is so short that it's effectively stopped by this process. The energy where the mean free path is comparable to the universe's size, I guess.

The cross-section for this annihilation probably depends on the energy of the gamma-rays and the CMB photons. I remember that the photon-photon cross-section for pair production has a certain energy dependence. Oh right, the cross-section σ is proportional to 1/(s), where s is the square of the center-of-mass energy. Or maybe it's a function of the photon energies.

Wait, the cross-section for two photons to annihilate into an electron-positron pair is given by something like σ ~ (α^2)/(4E^4), where E is the photon energy. Wait, but each photon has its own energy. So if one photon is high-energy (gamma-ray) and the other is low-energy (CMB), the cross-section would depend on both energies.

Let me think. The gamma-ray has energy E, and the CMB photon has energy ε, which is 1e-3 eV. The center-of-mass energy squared s is (E + ε)^2. But since ε is much smaller than E, s ≈ (E)^2. So s is about E^2.

The cross-section for pair production is proportional to α^2/(s), which becomes α^2/(E^2). Wait, I'm not sure if it's E squared or E to the fourth. Wait, no, I think the cross-section for photon-photon annihilation is proportional to 1/(E^2 * ε) or something like that. Or perhaps σ ∝ 1/E^2, considering the typical dependence.

Wait, another approach: The
