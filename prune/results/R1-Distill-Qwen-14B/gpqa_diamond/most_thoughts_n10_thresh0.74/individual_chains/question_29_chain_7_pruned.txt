Okay, so I need to figure out which mutant would eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. The gene has five exons and four introns. The problem is that the compound is bad, so we need to mutate the gene so it doesn't produce it anymore.

The question says that after sequencing, the changes are at the beginning of the sequence in the first exon area. So I'm looking at the first exon's DNA sequence in each mutant and seeing how they differ from the intact gene.

The intact gene's first part is:
5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Looking at each mutant:

Mutant 1:
5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Comparing to the intact, the first part is ATGTTTCTCGC... So in Mutant1, the sequence starts ATGTTCTACGCT. Let me see where the changes are. The third position, maybe? Let's look at the exact differences.

Intact: ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT
Mutant1: ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC

Wait, let me line them up:

ATGTTT CTCGCT GGTACT TCTGTG GATGAA CATAT TTA TTG TCGT
Mutant1: ATGTTCT ACGCT GGTACTTCTGTGGATGAA...

Wait, perhaps I should write the sequences in parts. Let's take the first part.

Intact: ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT

Mutant1: ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC

Wait, let me see the differences:

The first exon starts with ATG..., which is the start codon. So positions after that.

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA...
Mutant1: ATG T T C T A C G C T GGT ACT TCT GTG...

Wait, that's a bit confusing. Let me count the nucleotides.

Let me write the first 20 bases for each:

Intact: ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGAT... Wait, maybe it's better to write each option's first part and compare.

Intact:
Positions 1-20: ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGAT
Wait, perhaps I should list each mutant's changes:

Mutant1: The sequence starts as ATGTTCTACGCTG... Looking for where it's different. So in the intact gene, after ATG, the next bases are TTTCTCGCT. In Mutant1, it's TCTACGCT.

Wait, maybe compare each nucleotide.

Intact: positions 1-20 (maybe more
