Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to break it down. The question says that two compounds, A and B, are treated with hydrochloric acid, sodium nitrite, and water. Each of these treatments produces a different diketone. I need to figure out what A and B are from the given options.

Hmm, I remember that when certain functional groups are treated with HCl, NaNO2, and water, they can form ketones. Wait, wasn't that related to the Stephen reduction or something else? Oh right! I think this is about the formation of ketones from secondary alcohols using these reagents. Or wait, maybe it's the hydrolysis of nitrites? No, wait, no. Oh wait, I think it's about the Beckmann rearrangement. No, Beckmann involves amides and rearrangement to ketones. Or maybe it's something else.

Wait, another thought: when a secondary alcohol is treated with HCl, NaNO2, and then H2O, it can form a ketone. Because under acidic conditions, the secondary alcohol is converted into an oxonium ion, which then undergoes a rearrangement. Oh right, that's the acid-catalyzed dehydration of secondary alcohols, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, I remember that nitrous acid (from HCl and NaNO2) can react with alcohols. 

Wait, maybe it's the formation of a nitroso compound. Oh, right, the Stephen reduction. No, Stephen is for ketones to secondary alcohols
