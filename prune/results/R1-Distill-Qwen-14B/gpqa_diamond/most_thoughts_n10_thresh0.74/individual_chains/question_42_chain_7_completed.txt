Okay, so I’ve got this question about exoplanets and their orbital periods. Hmm, let's see. I remember that the equilibrium temperature is related to the star's luminosity and the planet's distance from the star. Oh right, the formula is something like T = [(L*(1 - a))/(16 * π * σ * D²)]^(1/4), where L is the star's luminosity, a is the albedo, and D is the distance. So the temperature ratio depends on the square root of the inverse of the distance ratio. Because if you take T1/T2, it would be sqrt(D2/D1), assuming L and a are the same for both. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the distance. So T ∝ 1 / sqrt(D). So if the temperature ratio is T1/T2 = 1.4, then (1/sqrt(D1)) / (1/sqrt(D2)) ) = 1.4 → sqrt(D2/D1) = 1.4 → D2/D1 = (1.4)^2 = 1.96. So D2 is about 1.96 times D1.

Wait, but the question says the ratio of Planet1 and Planet2's equilibrium temperatures is approximately 1.4. So T1/T2 = 1.4. So using T ∝ 1/sqrt(D), T1/T2 = sqrt(D2/D1). So 1.4 = sqrt(D2/D1) → D2/D1 = 1.96. So D2 is 1.96 times D1. Got it.

Similarly, the ratio between Planet2 and Planet3 is 2.3. So T2/T3 = 2.3. So sqrt(D3/D2) = 2.3 → D3/D2 = (2.3)^2 ≈ 5.29. So D3 = 5.29 * D2. But D2 is 1.96 * D1, so D3 = 5.29 * 1.96 * D1 ≈ let me calculate that. 5.29 * 2 is 10.58, 5.29 *1.96 is roughly 5.29*(2 -0.04) = 10.58 - 0.2116 ≈ 10.37. So D3 is about 10.37 times D1. So D3 is about 10.37 times D1.

Wait, but the question is about the orbital period. Oh, right, Kepler's third law. The period squared is proportional to the distance cubed, assuming same star mass. So P² ∝ D³. So P ∝ D^(3/2). So the period ratio P3/P1 would be (D3/D1)^(3/2). Since D3/D1 is about 10.37, so (10.37)^(3/2). Let me compute that. 10.37^(1/2) is approximately sqrt(10) is about 3.16, sqrt(10.37) about 3.22. Then 3.22 cubed is 3.22 *3.22 = ~10.36, then *3.22 ≈ 33.34. So P3/P1 ≈ 33.34. So about 33.4 times, which would be option D) ~33.4.

Wait, but wait a minute. The masses of the planets are given. Hmm, but in Kepler's law, the period depends on the mass of the star and the planet's distance. But wait, the planet's mass is negligible compared to the star, right? So Kepler's law is based on the star's mass, not the planet's. So the planet masses shouldn't affect the orbital period. So the mass ratios given (1.15 and 1.35) probably don't affect the distance ratios, which we've already calculated based on the temperature ratios. So I can ignore the mass ratios for this problem. So the answer should be D.

But just to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me recap:

T1/T2 = 1.4 → D2 = (1.4)^2 * D1 = 1.96 D1.

T2/T3 = 2.3 → D3 = (2.3)^2 * D2 = 5.29 * D2 = 5.29 *1.96 D1 ≈ 10.3684 D1.

P3/P1 = (D3/D1)^(3/2) = (10.3684)^(3/2).

Compute 10.3684^(1/2) is about 3.22, then 3.22^3 is 3.22 * 3.22 = 10.3684; 10.3684 * 3.22 ≈ 33.36. So approximately 33.36, which is about 33.4, so option D.


To determine the factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1, we use the relationship between equilibrium temperature and distance, as well as Kepler's third law.

### Step 1: Relating Temperature Ratios to Distances
The equilibrium temperature of a planet is inversely proportional to the square root of its distance from the star:  
\[
T \propto \frac{1}{\sqrt{D}}
\]
Given the temperature ratios:  
- \( T_1 / T_2 = 1.4 \), we find \( D_2 / D_1 = (1.4)^2 = 1.96 \).  
- \( T_2 / T_3 = 2.3 \), we find \( D_3 / D_2 = (2.3)^2 = 5.29 \).  

Thus, \( D_3 / D_1 = D_3 / D_2 \cdot D_2 / D_1 = 5.29 \cdot 1.96 \approx 10.37 \).  

### Step 2: Relating Orbital Periods to Distances
Kepler's third law states that the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the distance:  
\[
P^2 \propto D^3 \quad \Rightarrow \quad P \propto D^{3/2}
\]
The ratio of the orbital periods is:  
\[
\frac{P_3}{P_1} = \left(\frac{D_3}{D_1}\right)^{3/2}
\]
Substituting \( D_3 / D_1 \approx 10.37 \):  
\[
\frac{P_3}{P_1} = (10.37)^{3/2}
\]
First, calculate \( \sqrt{10.37} \approx 3.22 \). Then, \( (3.22)^3 \approx 33.36 \).  

### Step 3: Final Answer
The orbital period of Planet3 is approximately 33.4 times larger than that of Planet1. The mass ratios of the planets are irrelevant to the orbital period, as they are negligible compared to the star's mass.
