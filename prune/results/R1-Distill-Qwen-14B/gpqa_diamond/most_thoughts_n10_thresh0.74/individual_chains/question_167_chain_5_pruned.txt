Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about calculating the non-Gaussianity of a Schrödinger cat state using relative entropy. Hmm, let me think this through step by step.

Alright, the state is given as |psi> = [cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>]/N. Normalization constant N is sqrt(1 + sin(2phi) exp(-2 alpha^2)). The parameters are phi = -pi/4 and alpha = 0.5. I need to find the non-Gaussianity (nG) using the relative entropy measure, which is del_b = [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)], where tau is the reference Gaussian state's density matrix.

Wait, wait, I remember that Gaussian states are states like coherent states, squeezed states, etc. The Schrödinger cat state is a superposition of two coherent states, so it's non-Gaussian. The relative entropy is a measure of how non-Gaussian the state is compared to a Gaussian reference.

But wait, how do I compute the relative entropy here? I think the relative entropy of non-Gaussianity is calculated with respect to the closest Gaussian state. Alternatively, maybe the reference Gaussian state is the one that minimizes the relative entropy. Or perhaps it's the maximum-entropy Gaussian, like a thermal state? Hmm, not too sure, but maybe I can proceed.

Wait, the problem says tau is the density matrix of a reference Gaussian state. So rho is the given state, which is non-Gaussian, and tau is some Gaussian state. The
