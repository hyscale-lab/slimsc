Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through the question again and think it through.

So, the question is about a dicarboxylic acid that undergoes dehydration to form an anhydride. Then this anhydride reacts with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene to give two products—major and minor. Both have the molecular formula C13H16O3. The key is the NOESY NMR data: the major product has a cross-peak, while the minor doesn't. I need to find which two resonances are connected by this cross-peak in the major product.

First, let's break down the problem.

1. **Starting Material and Anhydride Formation:**
   The starting material is a dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene. Dehydration of a dicarboxylic acid typically forms an anhydride. Since the acid has a cis-alkene, the dehydration would lead to a cyclic anhydride. The structure of the anhydride is likely a five-membered ring because those are more stable. So, the anhydride would have two ester groups connected by a ring.

2. **NMR Data of the Anhydride:**
   The 1H NMR shows a single peak at 7 ppm. That's a strong upfield shift, maybe from an aromatic proton? Wait, no, 7 ppm is more typical for aromatic protons, but wait—it's a singlet, which suggests equivalent protons. Wait, or maybe it's a carbonyl adjacent to something else. Alternatively, maybe it's an aldehyde proton? No, aldehydes are around 9-10 ppm. Wait, wait—another possibility: the protons adjacent to the carbonyl in an anhydride. Alternatively, maybe it's an aromatic ring. But wait, the starting material has a cis-alkene. So the anhydride is formed from that, so it's a cyclic structure.

   Wait, the anhydride's 1H NMR has a single peak at 7 ppm. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the 7 ppm is from an olefinic (alkene) proton. But wait, in a cyclic anhydride, perhaps the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl have protons that are deshielded. Alternatively, perhaps the alkene is now part of a conjugated system. Wait, the starting material is a cis-alkene, so the dehydration would form a cyclic anhydride, and perhaps the double bond is now part of the ring. So the protons on the carbons next to the carbonyl groups would be deshielded. But wait, the 7 ppm is a singlet. Maybe it's a pair of equivalent protons, like two sets of equivalent protons?

   Alternatively, maybe the 7 ppm is from two sets of equivalent protons, but the NMR shows a single peak because of symmetry. So perhaps it's a geminal di-substitution. Hmm, but then they wouldn't be split into a singlet unless they're equivalent and not split by any neighboring protons.

   But wait, the 13C NMR has two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm. 137 ppm is indicative of a carbon adjacent to an oxygen, perhaps in an ester or carbonyl group. 165 ppm is a carbonyl carbon, likely an ester or anhydride carbonyl. So the anhydride would have two carbonyl carbons, each at around 165 ppm. But wait, the 13C shows two peaks, so maybe the two carbonyl carbons are equivalent, or perhaps there's another carbon at 137, which could be the bridgehead carbons in the cyclic anhydride. Wait, but in a cyclic anhydride like maleic anhydride, the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl are at about 128-130 ppm, I think. Wait, maybe I'm confusing this. Let me think: the structure of maleic anhydride has two carbonyl groups (each around 165 ppm) and the two adjacent carbons (each around 135 ppm, perhaps). So in the 13C NMR, we'd have two carbonyls at ~165 ppm and the adjacent carbons at ~135 ppm. But the question says the 13C NMR has two peaks: 137 ppm and 165 ppm. So maybe only two types: the carbonyl carbons are all equivalent, so one peak at 165, and the adjacent carbons are another type, perhaps two different types? Or wait, maybe there are two carbons that are equivalent, like two carbons each attached to a carbonyl. Hmm. Maybe the anhydride is a five-membered ring, with two carbonyl groups opposite each other. So perhaps each of the adjacent carbons is the same, so the 13C would show two peaks: one at 165 (the carbonyls) and one at ~137 (the adjacent carbons).

   So the structure of the anhydride is probably a five-membered ring, with two carbonyl groups. So perhaps from a cis-dicarboxylic acid, the dehydration forms a cyclic anhydride where the double bond is in the ring, making it a conjugated system.

3. **Reaction with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene:**
   The next step is that this anhydride reacts with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. So the anhydride is a dienophile, and the cyclopentadiene is a diene. So this is a Diels-Alder reaction.

   In a Diels-Alder reaction, the diene (1,3-cyclopentadiene) reacts with a dienophile (the anhydride) to form a six-membered cyclohexene derivative with two ester groups.

   But wait, the dienophile would be the anhydride, which is a good dienophile. So the product would be a bicyclic structure. Wait, but the diene is 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. So that's a substituted cyclopentadiene. The structure would be cyclopentadiene with methyl groups at positions 2,3,4? Wait, 1,3-cyclopentadiene is a conjugated diene, and with substituents at 2 and 4? Let me draw it mentally: positions 1 and 3 are double bonds, so positions 2, 4, and 5 (if it's cyclopentene) have single bonds. Wait, no, 1,3-cyclopentadiene would have double bonds between 1-2 and 3-4, making a conjugated diene. So adding methyl groups at positions 2,3,4 would make it 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. So the structure is a five-membered ring with two double bonds? No, wait, 1,3-cyclopentadiene is
