Okay, so I've got this astronomy question about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, let me try to think through this.

Alright, the question says that astronomers found two planets using the RV method. Both stars have the same mass as our Sun, and the planets have masses similar to Neptune. So the stars are like our Sun, and the planets are Neptune-sized, which I think is important because it tells me their masses are comparable, but maybe not the same as Jupiter or something.

The planets are both in circular orbits, so I don't have to worry about eccentricity messing things up. That probably simplifies the calculations.

Now, the key part is about the periodic shifts of the spectral lines. For planet #1, the shift is up to 5 milliangstroms. For planet #2, it's 7 milliangstroms. Wait, I remember that the radial velocity method detects the Doppler shift caused by the star moving due to the planet's gravity. The bigger the shift, the higher the velocity of the star, right?

So, the RV semi-amplitude K is related to the velocity of the star. K is given by the formula that involves the planet's mass, the star's mass, and the orbital distance or period. Oh wait, the formula I think is K = (v) which depends on (M_planet sin i) / (M_star) * something. Oh wait, maybe I should think about the formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude.

The formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude is K = ( (G * (M_planet) ) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(0.5) ) ) )^(1/3) ) * (sin i) / ( (P) * ( (1 + M_planet/M_star)^(2/3) ) ) ) ) ) Hmm, maybe that's not the most straightforward way.

Wait, I think a more simplified version comes into play when M_planet is much smaller than M_star, which is the case here since both planets are Neptune-like and stars are solar mass. So M_planet << M_star; so M_star + M_planet ≈ M_star. Also, the eccentricity e is zero because the orbits are circular, so that term goes away.

So the formula for K (radial velocity semi-amplitude) simplifies to:

K = ( (G * P )^(1/3) * (M_planet) sin i ) / ( (2π) * (M_star)^(2/3) ) ) )

Wait, or maybe another version. Let me think again. I remember another form: K = (v) where v is the star's velocity, which depends on the planet's mass, the orbital period, and the distance. Alternatively, another approach is using Kepler's third law.

Wait, perhaps it's better to relate the velocities of the two stars to the orbital periods. Because the question is about the ratio of the orbital periods.

So the RV method gives a velocity semi-amplitude K. The velocity K is the maximum speed the star moves due to the planet's orbit. But for each planet, the K given is the maximum shift observed. So planet #1's star has a K of 5 milliangstroms, and planet #2's is 7 milliangstroms. Wait, wait, no, wait—
