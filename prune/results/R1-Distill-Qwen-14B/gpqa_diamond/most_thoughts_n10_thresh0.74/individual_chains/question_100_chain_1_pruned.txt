Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll think it through.

The question starts with Compound A, which has the formula C3H6. Hmm, that's a three-carbon compound with six hydrogens. Oh wait, C3H6 could be either propene (which is an alkene) or cyclopropane. But more likely, since alkene is more reactive, I think it's propene. So A is propene.

The first reaction is bromination in the presence of carbon tetrachloride. That rings a bell. Bromination of alkenes is typically an addition reaction. So propene (CH2=CH2CH3) reacting with Br2 in CCl4 would add bromine across the double bond. So the product B would be 1,2-dibromopropane? Wait, no. Wait, propene is CH2=CHCH3. Adding Br2 would give 1,2-dibromopropane. But wait, I'm a bit confused. Propene is CH2=CH2CH3? No, wait, propene is CH2=CHCH3. So adding Br2 across the double bond would give CH2BrCHBrCH3? No, wait, the addition is anti, so maybe it's more about where the bromines attach. Alternatively, maybe it's 1-bromo-1-propene? No, wait, no. Adding Br2 to propene (CH2=CHCH3) would yield 1,2-dibromopropane, which is CH2BrCH2BrCH3? No, wait, no. Wait, propene is CH2=CHCH3. Adding Br2 would give CH2BrCHBrCH3. Oh wait, wait. Propene has three carbons: CH2-CH2-CH3? No, no, no. Wait, propene is CH2=CHCH3. So when you add Br2, the double bond breaks, and each of the two carbons gets a Br. So the product would be 1,2-dibromopropane: CH2BrCHBrCH3? Wait, no, that would be if it were CH2Br-CHBr-CH3, but wait, the structure would actually be CH2BrCH2CH2Br? No, no, wait. Wait, no. Propene is CH3-CH
