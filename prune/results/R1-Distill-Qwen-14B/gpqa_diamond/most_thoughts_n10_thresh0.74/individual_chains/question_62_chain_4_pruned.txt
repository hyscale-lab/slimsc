Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me try to work through it step by step. The question is about finding the correct sequence of reagents to synthesize a specific compound from ethynylcyclohexane. The target molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me break it down.

First, I need to understand what the target molecule looks like. So, the name suggests that there's a cyclohexane ring attached to a cyclohexyl group, a hydroxymethyl group, and a carbonyl group (since it's an aldehyde). Wait, actually, no—cyclohexanecarbaldehyde would have an aldehyde group attached to a cyclohexane ring. So, the structure is a cyclohexane ring with a substituent that's a cyclohexyl group, a hydroxymethyl group, and an aldehyde group.

Wait, let me try to sketch it. So, the main ring is cyclohexane. Attached to it is a group that has a cyclohexyl (another ring) connected via a carbon that also has a hydroxyl group and a methyl group? Or maybe the substituent is a cyclohexyl group, a hydroxymethyl (CH2OH), and a carbonyl group (CHO). Hmm, perhaps I should think in terms of the steps needed to get from ethynylcyclohexane to this target.

The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane, which is a cyclohexane ring with an ethynyl group (a triple bond connected to another carbon, so CH2-C≡CH). Wait, no, ethynyl is -C≡C-CH2-? No, ethynyl is the substituent -C≡CH. So ethynylcyclohexane would have a cyclohexane ring with a substituent that's a triple bond to a CH2 group. Wait, actually, ethynyl is the acetylene group. So cyclohexane with an ethynyl group would be CH2CH2C≡CH attached to the ring? No, ethynyl is the substituent—so I think it's cyclohexane with a substituent group -C≡CH.

Now, I need to think about the transformations
