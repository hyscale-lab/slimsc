Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about calculating the non-Gaussianity of a Schrödinger cat state using the relative entropy measure. Hmm, let me try to break it down.

First, I need to understand what the question is asking. The state is given as a superposition of two coherent states, right? Coherent states are Gaussian states, so when you have a superposition like this, the state becomes non-Gaussian. The question is asking for the non-Gaussianity (nG) using the relative entropy measure.

The formula given for non-Gaussianity is del_b = [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)], where rho is the density matrix of the non-Gaussian state and tau is the density matrix of a reference Gaussian state. Wait, no, wait, the definition might be a bit different. Oh right, relative entropy is usually defined as S(rho||tau) = trace(rho ln rho) - trace(rho ln tau). But in this case, the question defines del_b as the difference between the von Neumann entropy of rho and tau. So maybe it's S(rho) - S(tau), where S is the entropy.

Wait, the problem statement says the relative entropy measure is given as del_b = [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)]. Oh, right, so it's the entropy of rho minus the entropy of the reference Gaussian state tau. That's an important point.

So, the steps I need to take are:

1. Find the density matrix rho for the given state |psi>.
2. Find the reference Gaussian state tau. Wait, what's the reference Gaussian state here? Because the state |psi> is a superposition of two coherent states, which are Gaussian. But the superposition isn't Gaussian, so the reference might be the state that is the closest Gaussian to it. Or perhaps the reference is the maximally mixed state? No, wait, Gaussian states include coherent states, thermal states, etc. So perhaps the reference Gaussian state is the state that the original state would have been if it were Gaussian. Alternatively, perhaps the reference is the state that minimizes the relative entropy—like the closest Gaussian approximation. Hmm, but without more information, maybe the reference is the mixture of the two coherent states that the state |psi> is in. Because when you have a superposition, the density matrix can be written as a mixture with certain probabilities—so perhaps the reference Gaussian tau is the mixture of the two coherent states with probabilities |
