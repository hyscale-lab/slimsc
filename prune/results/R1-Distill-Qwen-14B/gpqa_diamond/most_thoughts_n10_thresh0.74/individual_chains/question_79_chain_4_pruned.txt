Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read through the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question says that compound X, with the formula C11H12O, was subjected to a reaction with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. Then, they provided the theoretical 1H-NMR and 13C-NMR spectra of the resulting product. My task is to identify what compound X was from the given options.

Hmm, okay. So, I think the key here is to figure out what the product is, and then backtrack to see what the starting material (compound X) would be.

Wait, but wait. The reaction conditions are with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane. I remember that this is a common reagent used in the formation of epoxides, specifically in epoxidation reactions. Oh right, it's a base used in the epoxidation of alkenes. So, compound X probably has an alkene, and the reaction forms an epoxide.

So, X is an alkene that, upon reaction with this base, forms an epoxide. So, the product is an epoxide derived from X's alkene. Therefore, looking at the NMRs of the product, I can deduce the structure of the epoxide, and from that, determine what X was.

Now, looking at the NMR data.

Starting with the 1H NMR:

δ 2.28 (3H, s) and 2.31 (3H, s). Two singlets each integrating to 3H. That suggests two methyl groups attached to something that doesn't split their signals. Maybe adjacent to carbonyl groups or something that deshields but doesn't cause splitting.

Then, 6.75 (1H, d), 7.08 (2H, d), 7.68 (1H, d), 7.71 (2H, d). These are aromatic protons. Let me think about how that could fit.

In an epoxide, the protons adjacent to the oxygen are typically deshielded and might show up as doublets. Alternatively, or perhaps the aromatic protons are part of a styryl group or something similar.

Looking at the 13C NMR:

δ 21.3 (s) and 28.4 (s). Those are likely for the two methyl groups. 21.3 is a bit low for a methyl attached to something like an oxygen, but wait, maybe it's part of a ketone or ester? Or perhaps it's attached to something else. The 28.4 is a bit higher, perhaps a CH2 or a CH in a different environment.

Then, 126.9 (2C, s) and 127.1 (1C, s), 129.1 (2C, s), 130.3 (1C, s). These are all in the aromatic region, as expected. The high ppm (like 141.5, 144.1) are likely carbonyl carbons or carbons attached to electronegative atoms. Wait, but in an epoxide, the carbons adjacent to the oxygen would be around 60-70 ppm or so. Hmm, perhaps I'm mixing up the carbons here.

Wait, looking again, the 13C NMR shows a peak at 197.7, which is a carbonyl. Wait, but epoxides don't have carbonyls. Oh wait a second, maybe the product is not an epoxide. Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the reaction.

Wait, wait, what's the reaction here. The reagent is 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane, which I think is used in the epoxidation of alkenes through the Prilezhaev epoxidation. So, the product should be an epoxide. But then why is there a carbonyl peak in the 13C NMR? Hmm, maybe I'm looking at the wrong product.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting compound X is an epoxide, and the reaction is something else. Wait, but the reaction conditions are for epoxidation, so I think X is the alkene that gets epoxidized.

Wait, maybe the product is a diastereomer or something else, but perhaps the problem is that the product is not an epoxide. Wait, maybe the product is a different compound entirely. Alternatively, perhaps X is an epoxide, and the reaction is another kind of process. Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing.

Wait, maybe I should start by analyzing the product's structure. Let's try to draw the possible structure.

Looking at the
