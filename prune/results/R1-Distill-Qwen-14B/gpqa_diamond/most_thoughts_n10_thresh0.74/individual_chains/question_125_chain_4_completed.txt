Okay, so I’ve got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let me take it step by step.

The question is about a particle in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential. The potential is given by V(r) = (1/2) m ω² r². I remember that in such a system, the potential is symmetric in all directions, so it's easier to work in spherical coordinates, which is what the problem is using.

The question asks for two things: the energy of the third excited state and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions that have the same energy eigenvalue.

First, I should recall the energy levels for a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator. I think the energy levels depend on the quantum numbers n_x, n_y, and n_z, but since it's isotropic, the energy only depends on the sum of these. Wait, no, I think in three dimensions, the energy is given by E = ħω(n + 3/2), where n is the sum of the quantum numbers nx, ny, nz. Or wait, no, more precisely, each direction contributes (n_i + 1/2) ħω, so the total energy is E = ħω (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2). But I also remember that sometimes, in three dimensions, the energy levels can be labeled by another quantum number, say N, which is the sum n_x + n_y + n_z. So E = ħω (N + 3/2 ), where N is a non-negative integer (0,1,2,...). 

Wait, but sometimes, people use different notation. I think in 3D harmonic oscillators, the energy levels are equally spaced. For each energy level, the value of N is the same, and the energy increases in steps of ħω. So the ground state is N=0, with E = (3/2) ħω. The first excited state would be N=1, which gives E = (5/2) ħω, and so on.

But wait, the question is about the third excited state. Hmm, I need to clarify what is considered the ground state and the order of excited states. The ground state is the lowest energy, which is N=0. The first excited state is the next higher energy, which is N=1. The second excited state would be N=2, and the third excited state would be N=3. So the third excited state has N=3.

So the energy would be E = (3 + 3/2) ħω = (9/2) ħω. Because E = ħω (N + 3/2) = ħω (3 + 3/2) = (9/2) ħω. So that’s the first part.

Now, the second part is about the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for that same energy eigenvalue. These are the number of distinct states (wavefunctions) that have the same energy. Since the energy depends on N, which is the sum of the individual quantum numbers, we're looking for all the possible (n_x, n_y, n_z) triplets that sum to N=3.

So, how many such triplets are there? Let me think. Each of nx, ny, nz are non-negative integers, and they must add up to 3.

This is a combinatorics problem. The number of non-negative integer solutions to n_x + n_y + n_z = 3 is equal to the combination with repetition. The formula for the number of solutions is (n + k -1 choose k-1), where n is the total and k is the number of variables. Here, n=3, k=3. So (3 +3 -1 choose 3-1) = (5 choose 2) = 10. So there are 10 possible triplets.

Alternatively, I can list them. Let me try:

- All permutations where one quantum number is 3 and the others are 0. So (3,0,0), (0,3,0), (0,0,3). That's 3 states.

Then, the cases where two quantum numbers are 1, and one is 1. Wait, no, wait. Let me think: no, sum to 3.

Wait, another approach: possible partitions of 3 into three non-negative integers.

Option 1: All three are zero except one which is 3. As above, 3 possibilities.

Option 2: Two are 1, and the third is 1. Wait, no: 1+1+1=3. So that's one more state. Wait, no, that's a single state where all three are 1. So that's one possibility, but wait, the sum is 3. So (1,1,1) is another triplet.

Another case: one quantum number is 2, another is 1, and the third is 0. How many such combinations? For example: (2,1,0). The number here is the number of permutations of these numbers. Since all are distinct, it's 3! =6.

Wait, so let me count all:

1. (3,0,0): 3 permutations
2. (2,1,0): 6 permutations
3. (1,1,1): 1 permutation
4. (0,0,3): same as (3,0,0), which is already counted.

Wait, perhaps I should list all possibilities:

n_x + n_y + n_z =3:

Possible triplets:

(3,0,0), (0,3,0), (0,0,3) → 3.

(2,1,0), (2,0,1), (1,2,0), (0,2,1), (1,0,2), (0,1,2) → 6.

(1,1,1) →1.

Are there any others? What about (3,1, -1)? No, because quantum numbers are non-negative.

So total triplets: 3 +6 +1=10. So 10 eigenfunctions.

Thus, the third excited state has energy (9/2)ħω, and 10 eigenfunctions.

Looking back at the options:

Option A) (9/2)ħω , 10 → that's what I got.

Option B) Some other energy expression, 10. Probably irrelevant because energy is wrong.

Option C) (9/2) ħω, 3 → energy correct but count wrong.

Option D) Same as B but with 3. Wrong on both counts.

So the correct option should be A.


The problem involves a quantum mechanical system of a particle in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential, \( V(r) = \frac{1}{2} m \omega^2 r^2 \). The energy levels for such a system are given by \( E = \hbar \omega (N + \frac{3}{2}) \), where \( N = n_x + n_y + n_z \) is the sum of the quantum numbers \( n_x, n_y, n_z \) associated with the three spatial dimensions. The ground state corresponds to \( N = 0 \), and the energy levels increase with \( N \).

For the third excited state, \( N = 3 \) (since the ground state is \( N = 0 \), the first excited state is \( N = 1 \), the second excited state is \( N = 2 \), and the third excited state is \( N = 3 \)). The energy of the third excited state is:

\[
E = \hbar \omega \left( 3 + \frac{3}{2} \right) = \frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega
\]

Next, the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions corresponding to the same energy eigenvalue is determined by the number of distinct combinations of \( (n_x, n_y, n_z) \) that satisfy \( n_x + n_y + n_z = 3 \). These combinations are:

1. \( (3, 0, 0) \), \( (0, 3, 0) \), \( (0, 0, 3) \): 3 solutions.
2. \( (2, 1, 0) \), \( (2, 0, 1) \), \( (1, 2, 0) \), \( (1, 0, 2) \), \( (0, 2, 1) \), \( (0, 1, 2) \): 6 solutions.
3. \( (1, 1, 1) \): 1 solution.

Adding these, there are \( 3 + 6 + 1 = 10 \) linearly independent eigenfunctions for the third excited state.

From the options provided:

- **Option A**: \( \frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega, 10 \) matches the calculated energy and the number of eigenfunctions.
- **Option B**: The energy expression is incorrect.
- **Option C**: The energy is correct, but the number of eigenfunctions is incorrect.
- **Option D**: Both the energy and the number of eigenfunctions are incorrect.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: A**
