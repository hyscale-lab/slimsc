Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. The FTIR shows ester groups, so there must be an ester functional group in the molecule. The 1H NMR has six signals: two aromatic H, two vinyl H, and two CH3 groups. No CH2 signals. So, the options are about the molecular formula.

First, let me think about what the structure might look like. Since it's a di-substituted benzene ring, there are two substituents attached. The presence of an ester group suggests that one of these substituents is an ester, like OCOOR or something similar.

Wait, di-substituted benzene. Two substituents. One is an ester group. What's the other? Well, the NMR tells us about the types of protons. Let's look at the NMR details.

NMR signals:
- Two aromatic H: maybe the ring has two sets of equivalent H. For example, in para positions, but since it's di-substituted, perhaps the substituents are in such a way that the ring has two sets of equivalent H. Alternatively, maybe it's a meta arrangement, but that usually gives three unique signals. Wait, but the question says two signals for aromatic H, so perhaps the substituents are in para positions, leading to two equivalent H environments. Let me think. For a para-substituted benzene, each substituent would be opposite each other. Wait, but if it's di-substituted, you have two substituents. Wait, but wait, in a di-substituted benzene, the substituents could be adjacent (ortho), across (para), or in a meta position. But if it's para, the substituents would be on opposite sides.

But wait, the ring would then have some symmetry. Let's say substituents A and B are para to each other. Then the aromatic H's would be either both in the same environment, or perhaps different. Wait, maybe the substituents are identical? No, wait, the di-substituted could have two different groups. Hmm, but the NMR shows two signals for aromatic H. So perhaps the substituents are in positions that cause the ring to have two distinct sets
