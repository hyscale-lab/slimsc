Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me read it again. The question is about finding the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction, S_y, for an electron in a specific spin state. The state is given as (3i, 4). Oh wait, so the spin state vector is a two-component vector, right?

I remember that expectation values in quantum mechanics involve the operator corresponding to the observable you're measuring. In this case, the observable is S_y, which is the spin along the y-axis. I think the spin operator S is related to the Pauli matrices. Oh right, the Pauli matrices are σ_x, σ_y, σ_z. And the spin operator S is (ħ/2) multiplied by each of those matrices, depending on the direction. So S_y must be (ħ/2) times σ_y.

The σ_y matrix given in the note is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So S_y would be (ħ/2) multiplied by that matrix. That makes S_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]].

The expectation value is calculated as the bra-ket product of the state with the operator. So the formula is <S_y> = <ψ| S_y |ψ>. Since ψ is a column vector (3i, 4), the bra vector would be the conjugate transpose, which is [ -4, -3i ] because conjugating 3i gives -3i, and the transpose swaps the rows.

So let's write down the state vectors. The ket vector |ψ> is [3i; 4], and the bra <ψ| is [ -4, -3i ].

The expectation value is <ψ| S_y |ψ>. Let me calculate S_y |ψ> first. So S_y acting on |ψ>:

S_y |ψ> = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]] * [3i; 4].

Let me compute this matrix multiplication. The first component is (0)(3i) + (-i)(4) = 0 + (-i)(4) = -4i. The second component is (i)(3i) + (0)(4) = i*(3i) = 3i². Since i² is -1, that becomes 3*(-1) = -3.

So S_y |ψ> equals (ħ/2) multiplied by the vector [-4i; -3], so [ (-4i)* (ħ/2), (-3)* (ħ/2) ].

Now, I need to compute <ψ| S_y |ψ>, which is the conjugate transpose of ψ dotted with this result. So, <ψ| is [ -4, -3i ], and the vector we just got is [ -4i*(ħ/2), -3*(ħ/2) ].

Wait, let me make that clear. The result after S_y acting on ψ is (ħ/2)*[-4i; -3]. So, when I take <ψ| multiplied by S_y |ψ>, it's the dot product of [ -4, -3i ] with [ -4i*(ħ/2), -3*(ħ/2) ].

So, let's compute each term. The first term is (-4) * (-4i * ħ/2) and the second term is (-3i) * (-3 * ħ/2).

First term: (-4) * (-4i * ħ/2) = (16 i ħ)/2 = 8 i ħ.

Wait, no, let me do the math step by step. 

First component of <ψ|: -4 multiplied by first component of S_y |ψ>, which is (-4i)*(ħ/2).

So (-4) * (-4i ħ/2) = (-4) * (-4i/2) ħ. Let's compute that.

-4 * (-4i/2) = (-4)*( -2i ) = 8i. So the first term is 8i ħ.

Second component: (-3i) multiplied by (-3)*(ħ/2). So that's (-3i) * (-3)(ħ/2) )= (9i)*(ħ/2).

Wait, (-3i) * (-3) is 9i? Let me compute that again.

(-3i) * (-3) = 9i. So when multiplied by (ħ/2), it's (9i ħ)/2.

So the two terms are 8i ħ and (9i ħ)/2. Now, sum them up.

Wait, but 8i ħ is the same as (16i ħ)/2, right? So adding (16i ħ/2 +9i ħ/2) gives (25i ħ)/2. So the total expectation value is (25i ħ)/2 multiplied by (ħ/2)? Wait, no, wait. Wait a second; I think I messed up the order here. Wait, no, let me retrace.

Wait, no, the calculation was S_y |ψ> is (ħ/2) multiplied by [ -4i, -3 ] as a column vector. Then, <ψ| S_y |ψ> is [ -4, -3i ] times (ħ/2) multiplied by that vector.

So <ψ| S_y |ψ> equals (ħ/2) multiplied by the dot product of [ -4, -3i ] and [ -4i, -3 ].

Wait, perhaps I should factor out the (ħ/2) first. So the calculation becomes:

(ħ/2) * [ (-4)(-4i) + (-3i)(-3) ].

Let me compute each term:

First term: (-4)(-4i) = 16i.

Second term: (-3i)(-3) = 9i.

So adding them: 16i +9i =25i.

Multiply by (ħ/2): (25i * ħ)/2.

Wait, but that's giving me an imaginary number. The expectation value should be a real number because spin measurement outcomes are real. That can't be right. So I must have made a mistake in my calculation.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the matrix multiplication earlier.

Let me redo the S_y |ψ> step.

S_y is (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]].

So when I multiply S_y by |ψ> = [3i;4], I get:

First component: (0)(3i) + (-i)(4) =
