Okay, so I have this question about radioactive decay probabilities. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my nuclear physics, but let's try to think it through.

Alright, the question says that we have an atom which has a 32% chance of decaying within 100 minutes. So, if I start monitoring it right away, after 100 minutes, there's a 32% probability it's decayed. Wait, but the question is about after 50 minutes have passed and it hasn't decayed yet. Now, what's the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes?

Wait, wait. So initially, the probability in 100 minutes is 32%. But what's the model here? Radioactive decay follows an exponential law, right? The probability that a nucleus hasn't decayed after time t is given by e^(-λt), where λ is the decay constant. So the decay probability in time t is 1 - e^(-λt).

So the given probability is 32% (0.32) for 100 minutes. Let me write that down.

0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ * 100)

Wait, so that means e^(-λ*100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68. So λ*100 is the natural log of 1/0.68.

Wait, because e^(-λt) = 0.68, so taking natural logs on both sides:

-λ * 100
