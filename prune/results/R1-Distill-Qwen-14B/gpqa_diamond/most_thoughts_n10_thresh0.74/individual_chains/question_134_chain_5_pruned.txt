Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it. Let's see what the question is asking. It says to calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when three different solutions are mixed. The solutions are 500 mL of 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL of 0.3 M H2SO4, and 200 mL of 0.5 M Ba(OH)2. The options are A to D, and I remember that enthalpy of neutralization is usually related to the heat released when an acid reacts with a base.

Hmm, wait, enthalpy of neutralization is typically when an acid and a base react to form water. The standard value is around -57 kJ/mol, but that's for strong acids and bases. Here, we have multiple acids and a base, so I think I'll need to figure out how much acid and base are present and how they react.

First, let me figure out the moles of each substance. Because HCl is a strong acid, it dissociates completely into H+ and Cl- ions. Each mole of HCl gives one mole of H+. H2SO4 is a strong acid too, but since it's diprotic, the first dissociation is complete, giving 2 H+ ions per mole. Wait, no, wait. Wait, for H2SO4 in water, the first H+ is released completely, but the second might not be as strong. But in neutralization reactions, I think we usually consider the first dissociation only because the second H+ is weaker, so maybe only one mole per mole of H2SO4. Or wait, in neutralization, each H2SO4 would provide two H+ ions because in the reaction with a base, both H+ would be neutralized. Hmm, I'm getting a little stuck here.

Wait, the reaction between H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 would be something like H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 + 2 H2O. So each mole of H2SO4 would neutralize two moles of OH-. Because Ba(OH)2 gives two OH- ions per mole. So the molar ratio is 1 H2SO4 to 1 Ba(OH)2, but each produces 2 H+ and 2 OH- respectively. So when they react, they neutralize each other in a 1:1 ratio for the acid and base, but each contributes two H+ and OH-.

Wait, but the problem says that all three solutions are mixed together. So I have HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2 all in the same mixture. So I need to calculate the total moles of H+ from the acids and the total moles of OH- from the base, then see which one is in excess. The neutralization would occur between the H+ and OH-.

Right, so first calculate moles:

For HCl: volume is 500 mL which is 0.5 L. Molarity is 0.2 M. So moles = 0.5 L * 0.2 mol/L = 0.1 mol HCl. Since HCl is a strong acid, it gives 0.1 mol H+.

For H2SO4: 300 mL is 0.3 L. 0.3 M. So moles = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 mol H2SO4. Each mole of H2SO4 gives 2 H+ ions, so 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 mol H+.

So total H+ from acids is 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 mol.

Now for Ba(OH)2: 200 mL is 0.2 L. 0.5 M. So moles = 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 mol Ba(OH)2. Ba(OH)2 dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2 OH^- per formula unit. So each mole gives 2 moles of OH-. So 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 mol OH-.

Wait, but when mixing, the H+ from acids will react with OH- from the base. So the neutralization reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O, which releases heat.

So how much of each do we have?

Total H+ is 0.28 mol. Total OH- is 0.2 mol.

So OH- is the limiting reagent here. All 0.2 mol OH- will react with 0.2 mol H+. That leaves 0.08 mol H+ unreacted.

So the moles of H+ consumed is 0.2 mol. The moles of OH- consumed is 0.2 mol.

The heat released (enthalpy change) depends on the moles of H+ and OH- reacting. The standard enthalpy of neutralization is about -57 kJ per mole of H+ (or OH-) because each mole of H+ reacting with OH- releases that much heat.

But wait, the problem asks for the
