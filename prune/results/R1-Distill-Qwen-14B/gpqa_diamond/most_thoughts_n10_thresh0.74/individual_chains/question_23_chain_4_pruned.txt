Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me see what the question is about.

The question says that a researcher reacted (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene with hydrogen bromide. After some time, they checked using TLC and saw that the reactant spot had diminished, and two new spots appeared. I need to figure out which of the options A, B, C, or D could be the products.

First, I should probably draw the structure of the starting material. The compound is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene. Let's break that down. The benzene ring has an ether group (-O-) attached. The other end of the ether is the butenyl group. The butenyl is but-3-en-1-yl, so the double bond is between C3 and C4. Wait, but but has four carbons. So positions are 1,2,3,4. The double bond is between 3 and 4. So the structure would be CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2? Wait, no, wait. Wait the substituents. Wait, but the but-3-en-1-yl group would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between 3 and 4? Wait no, but wait, but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2CH2CH=CH2. Wait, no, perhaps better to write it as CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 but with a double bond between carbons 3 and 4? No, wait, the numbering: for but-3-en-1-yl, the substituent is on the first carbon. So it's CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with the double bond starting at carbon 3. Wait, but but has four carbons, so the structure would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond between C3 and C4. Wait, but that's not possible because in but-3-en-1-yl, the double bond is between C3 and C4, but I'm getting a bit confused. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2-CH
