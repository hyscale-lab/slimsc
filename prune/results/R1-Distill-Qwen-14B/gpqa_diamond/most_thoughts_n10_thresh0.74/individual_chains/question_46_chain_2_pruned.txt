Okay, so I've got this problem about treating racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene with Grubbs catalyst. Hmm, I need to figure out how many possible products there are, excluding ethene. Alright, let's start by recalling what I know about Grubbs catalyst and the reactions it's involved in.

Grubbs catalyst is a transition metal carbene catalyst, right? It's used in olefin metathesis reactions. Olefin metathesis involves the redistribution of alkene fragments. So, in this case, the starting material is 3-methylpent-1-ene, which I think looks like this: CH₂=CH-C(CH3)-CH₂-CH3. Wait, no, wait. 3-methylpent-1-ene would have the double bond between C1 and C2. So the structure should be CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂-CH3? Wait, wait. Let me count the carbons. Pent means five carbons. So position 1 is the first carbon, so the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, wait, wait. Let me draw it again. Structure of 3-methylpent-1-ene: the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the formula would be CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂-? Wait, wait, no. Wait, pent-1-ene would be five carbons in a row, starting with a double bond at position 1. So the structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂-CH3. Wait, no, wait. Let me count: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. The first carbon (1) is connected to the second (2) via double bond. Then, the third (3) has a methyl group. So the structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂-CH3. So it's 1-pentene with a methyl branch on carbon 3.

Now, since it's racemic, it's a 50:50 mixture of the two enantiomers. But wait, wait. Wait, can 3-methylpent-1-ene have stereocenters? Let me see: the double bond is between C1 and C2. C3 is CH(CH3). Wait, so the structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂-CH3.
