Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. It's about a [4+2] cycloaddition reaction between 2,5-dimethylthiophene and furan-2,5-dione, and I need to find the exo product. Hmm, I remember that cycloadditions are pericyclic reactions, and the type of transition state determines the endo or exo product. Wait, but wait, [4+2] is a Diels-Alder reaction, right? So I need to think about the Diels-Alder reaction mechanism.

Wait, no, wait. Diels-Alder is a [4π + 2π] cycloaddition. The electron-rich diene and electron-poor dienophile. So in this case, which is the diene and which is the dienophile? Let me see. 2,5-dimethylthiophene is a thiophene ring with two methyl groups. Thiophene is aromatic, but when it's part of a cycloaddition, does it act as a diene? I think thiophene is a good diene because it's conjugated. Wait, but the other molecule is furan-2,5-dione. Furan-2,5-dione is also known as diones, maybe something like a diketone. Furan itself is a dienophile when it's activated, like in the Diels-Alder reaction. So maybe here, the thiophene is the diene, and the furan-2,5-dione is the dienophile.

Wait, but wait. Furan is usually a dienophile when it's substituted with electron-withdrawing groups. So the furan-2,5-dione has two ketone groups, which are electron-withdrawing. That should activate the dienophile. So the furan-2,5-dione would be the dienophile in this case, and the 2,5-dimethylthiophene would be the diene. Because the methyl groups are electron-donating, making the thiophene more electron-rich. So the reaction is between a diene (thiophene) and a dienophile (furan-2,5-dione), so a Diels-Alder reaction.

Wait, but wait a second. Wait, the Diels-Alder reaction is between a conjugated diene and a dienophile. Thioph
