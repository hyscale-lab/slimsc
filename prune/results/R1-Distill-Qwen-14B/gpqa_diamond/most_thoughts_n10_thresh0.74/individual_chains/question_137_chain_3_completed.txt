Okay, so I've got this physics problem about a synchrocyclotron, and I'm a bit rusty on my accelerator physics, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The problem says a proton is injected into a synchrocyclotron at time t=0 with negligible kinetic energy, so T is approximately zero. It undergoes two accelerations to reach a kinetic energy T1 of 950 MeV. The alternating voltage applied is given by U(t) = U0 cos[2πν(α)t + Φ0]. The given data is Φ0 = π/4 and U0 = 190 kV. The question is asking how many revolutions the proton makes.

Hmm, I remember that cyclotrons and synchrocyclotrons are types of particle accelerators that use magnetic fields and electric fields to accelerate charged particles. The cyclotron is the basic one, while the synchrocyclotron is an advanced version that can handle relativistic particles by varying the magnetic field over time.

Wait, in cyclotrons, the particles move in a circular path, and each time they complete a half-revolution, they get a push from the electric field. The key here is that the frequency of the applied voltage must match the particle's cyclotron frequency for efficient acceleration.

So, the proton starts with negligible kinetic energy, so effectively, its initial velocity is zero. The accelerator applies an alternating voltage, which creates an electric field that accelerates the proton each time it passes through the gap between the D-shaped electrodes. Each acceleration happens as the proton completes a certain fraction of its orbit.

Wait, for a cyclotron, the particles are accelerated each time they pass through the gap, and the time between each acceleration is half the period of the cyclotron motion. The frequency of the applied voltage must match the cyclotron frequency for this to work.

But wait, in a synchrocyclotron, the magnetic field isn't constant because as the particles gain energy, their mass increases relativistically, so the cyclotron frequency changes. To account for this, the magnetic field is varied with time. But perhaps for this problem, we can treat it as if the frequency is adjusted to match the changing frequency of the proton's motion.

But the question is about the number of revolutions the proton makes. Each revolution would involve passing through the gap twice (for each half-cycle) so each revolution gives two acceleration kicks. But I'm not sure; maybe each half-revolution is when the electric field accelerates the proton once.

Wait, let's think about the basics. In a cyclotron, the particles are accelerated each time they pass through the gap between the dees (the D-shaped electrodes). Each time they go through the gap, they experience an acceleration. The time between each acceleration is the time it takes for the particle to complete half a revolution, because each time they go through the gap, they get a push, and the direction of the magnetic field (via the electric field in the gap) is arranged so that the particle is accelerated each time.

So, the acceleration occurs every half-period (each 180 degrees) of the cyclotron motion. So, each kick happens every time the particle completes half a revolution. So each revolution would have two acceleration events.

But wait, the problem here is a synchrocyclotron. So the setup is a bit different. But maybe the basic idea still applies. The frequency of the applied voltage is such that each time the particle passes through the gap, the voltage is in the right phase to accelerate it.

In this case, the applied voltage is U(t) = U0 cos[2πν(α) t + Φ0]. The phase Φ0 is π/4, so the initial phase is 45 degrees. But I'm not sure how that affects the number of revolutions; perhaps it's just part of the problem setup and doesn't directly influence the count.

Now, the goal is to find out how many times the proton revolves around the synchrocyclotron before reaching the kinetic energy of 950 MeV.

First, I think I need to find out how many acceleration steps the proton undergoes. Each step (each acceleration) would correspond to a certain phase of the voltage.

Wait, the kinetic energy gained by the proton would be related to the number of times it's accelerated. Since each acceleration imparts a certain energy, the total number of steps would give the total energy.

But wait, the voltage is applied as a function of time, but each time the proton passes through the gap, the potential is different. So each time, the proton gains some energy, but due to relativistic effects, the energy per step might not be constant.

Wait, but in a cyclotron, the energy gained per step is constant if the frequency is matched, because as the speed increases, the cyclotron frequency decreases. But in a synchrocyclotron, the magnetic field is adjusted to keep the cyclotron frequency matched to the applied frequency.

Alternatively, perhaps each acceleration step imparts a fixed energy increment, such as the voltage times the charge, but I'm not exactly sure.

Wait, the potential difference across the gap is U(t), but the actual energy gain per acceleration would be e * U(t), where e is the proton charge. Because as the proton moves through the gap, it gains kinetic energy equal to the work done by the electric field, which is e times the potential difference.

But in reality, for a cyclotron, the energy per step is e * U0, because the maximum electric field is when the cosine is 1, so the maximum voltage is U0. So each time the particle goes through the gap, it gains e * U0 of energy.

But wait, wait. The voltage is applied as a function of time, and each time the proton passes through the gap, the voltage could be varying. But for maximum efficiency, the voltage is such that it's in resonance with the particle's motion, so the proton is accelerated each time it's in the gap. So the number of revolutions would be determined by how many such acceleration steps it takes to reach the desired energy.

But, wait, the initial kinetic energy is zero, so the final kinetic energy is the sum of the energy gains from each acceleration step.

Let me think: Each time the proton goes through the gap, it gains energy. So the total number of acceleration events N is such that N * e * U0 = T1.

Wait, but that's assuming each step gives e*U0. But no, because the maximum voltage is U0, so the maximum energy per step is e * U0. But the voltage varies with time, so maybe the effective energy per step depends on the cosine term. Hmm, but for a synchrocyclotron, the voltage is set up so that the particle is accelerated each time it passes through the gap, and the phase is matched. So perhaps each step gives the same amount of energy.

Wait, but in reality, the energy per step depends on the voltage. So if the voltage is U0 cos(theta), then the energy gain would be e * U0 cos(theta) each time. But that complicates things because each step would vary. But I think in practice, the voltage is designed such that the phase is correct for acceleration, so each time the particle is in the gap, the voltage is at its maximum, so U(t) is U0, so each step gives e * U0.

Wait, but in the problem, the initial phase is Φ0 = π/4. So at t=0, U(0) is U0 cos(Phi0) = U0 cos(π/4) = U0 * sqrt(2)/2 ≈ 0.707 * U0. So the initial acceleration isn't maximum. But perhaps that's just the starting point, and as time progresses, the phase aligns such that the voltage is at the correct phase for acceleration. So the first acceleration might not be the maximum, but perhaps the effective number of steps is such that the average energy per step is e*U0.

Alternatively, perhaps the phase shift doesn't matter because the number of revolutions is determined by the total energy and the voltage. Let me try to think of it this way.

The proton starts at rest, so its kinetic energy is zero. It undergoes two accelerations, but wait, the problem says it undergoes two accelerations? Wait, the question says it undergoes two accelerations to reach T1=950 MeV. Wait, that can't be right. Or perhaps I'm misreading it.

Wait, the question states: "A proton is injected at t=0 with negligible kinetic energy, i.e. T~0 undergoes two accelerations in the accelerator to reach the kinetic energy T1=950MeV." Oh, wait no, that's not correct. The wording is a bit confusing. Let me read it again.

"A proton is injected at t=0 with negligible kinetic energy, i.e. T~0 undergoes two accelerations in the accelerator to reach the kinetic energy T1=950MeV."

Wait, that can't be right because two accelerations would give a very small energy. So perhaps the problem is saying that it undergoes two steps of acceleration, but that would probably be way less than 950 MeV. So maybe it's a typo, and it's supposed to say "undergoes many accelerations" or similar. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is referring to two steps per revolution? I'm a bit confused.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the proton undergoes acceleration twice per revolution, meaning each revolution gives two acceleration steps. So the number of revolutions would be N, and the number of acceleration steps would be 2N.

But I'm not entirely sure. Let's proceed.

Let me try to model it. The total kinetic energy is T1 = 950 MeV. The energy per acceleration step is e * U0, where U0 is the maximum voltage. Each revolution corresponds to two acceleration steps, so the number of acceleration steps would be N_acc = 2 * N_rev, where N_rev is the number of revolutions.

So, T1 = N_acc * e * U0.

Wait, but wait, each acceleration gives some energy, but in reality, the energy per step depends on the voltage. So the maximum possible energy per step is e * U0. But if the voltage is varying, then the average energy per step would be less. Hmm, but perhaps the problem simplifies it, assuming that each step gives e * U0.

But wait, the problem states that the voltage is U(t) = U0 cos[...], so each time the proton passes through the gap, it gets e * U(t) energy. But for maximum efficiency, the voltage is such that each time, the proton is accelerated when the voltage is at its maximum, i.e., when cos(...)=1, so U(t)=U0. So perhaps only every other step gives maximum energy.

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Let me think about the process.

In a cyclotron, the particles are accelerated each time they pass through the gap. The gap is where the electric field is applied. The frequency of the applied voltage must match the particle's cyclotron frequency.

The cyclotron frequency is given by ω_c = (qB)/(m), where q is charge, B is magnetic field, m is mass.

The time taken for the particle to complete one revolution is T = 2π m/(qB). So the cyclotron frequency is ω_c = 2π / T.

The applied voltage must have a frequency ν such that ν = ω_c / 2π, because the electric field alternates every half-cycle. So every time the particle completes half a revolution, the electric field is in the correct phase to accelerate it.

In a synchrocyclotron, since the magnetic field isn't constant, the frequency ν is adjusted to match the changing ω_c as the proton gains energy.

But perhaps for the purposes of this problem, we can model the number of revolutions based on the total energy and the energy per revolution.

Wait, but the problem gives the voltage as U(t) = U0 cos[2π ν(α) t + Φ0]. The 'alpha' in ν(α) probably indicates that the frequency ν depends on the particle's state, perhaps its energy or mass.

But maybe that's complicating things. Let's think about the energy gained per revolution.

Each time the proton completes a revolution, it gains a certain amount of energy. Let's say each revolution gives k MeV of energy. Then, the total number of revolutions N would be 950 / k.

But how much energy per revolution?

Wait, in a cyclotron, each acceleration step (half a revolution) gives e * U0 of energy. So each full revolution would give two steps, so 2 e U0.

Wait, but let me think again. Each time the proton passes through the gap, it gains e * U0, and that happens once per half-revolution. So for each revolution, there are two acceleration steps, each giving e U0. So each revolution gives 2 e U0 energy.

Wait, but no, because in reality, the time it takes for one revolution increases as the proton gains energy, because its speed increases (relativistically). So the cyclotron frequency decreases as the proton gains energy. But in the synchrocyclotron, the magnetic field is adjusted to keep the frequency matching.

Hmm, perhaps in this problem, it's assumed that each revolution corresponds to a fixed energy gain, so the number of revolutions N is T1 divided by energy per revolution.

Alternatively, perhaps each time the proton goes around once, it gains a certain fixed amount of energy. But I'm not exactly sure.

Wait, let's calculate the energy per revolution.

The energy per acceleration step is e * U0. Each revolution has two acceleration steps. So each revolution gives 2 e U0 of energy.

Wait, but that's only if U0 is the same each time. However, in reality, the energy per step increases as the proton's velocity increases because the magnetic rigidity (Bρ = mv) changes. But in a synchrocyclotron, the magnetic field is adjusted to keep B such that the momentum (mv) increases proportionally, so that the radius of the orbit remains correct for the frequency.

But perhaps in this problem, each revolution gives a fixed energy increment of e U0. So the total number of revolutions N would be T1 / (2 e U0).

Wait, but let's compute that.

First, the charge of a proton is e ≈ 1.6e-19 C.

U0 is given as 190 kV, so 1.9e5 V.

Each acceleration step gives e * U0. For two steps per revolution, each revolution gives 2 e U0.

So the energy per revolution is 2 * e * U0.

But let's compute this.

e * U0 = (1.6e-19 C) * (1.9e5 V) = 1.6 *1.9e-14 J = 3.04e-14 J.

But 1 eV is 1.6e-19 J, so 3.04e-14 J is (3.04e-14 J)/(1.6e-19 J/eV) ) = approx 1.9e5 eV, which is 190 keV.

So each acceleration step gives 190 keV. Each revolution has two steps, so 380 keV per revolution.

Wait, but wait. The problem states that the initial energy is negligible, so the total energy is the sum of all the steps.

So T1 is 950 MeV = 950,000 keV.

Each revolution gives 380 keV. So the number of revolutions N is 950,000 / 380 ≈ let's compute that.

950,000 / 380 ≈ 2500. So approximately 2500 revolutions.

Looking at the options, option D is 2500.

But wait, wait. Let's double-check. Maybe I made a mistake in the energy per revolution.

Wait, each step is 190 keV, and each revolution has two steps, so 380 keV per rev.

950,000 divided by 380 is indeed approximately 2500. Because 380 * 2500 = 950,000.

Wait, 380 * 2500 = (380 * 25) * 100 = (9500) *100 = 950,000. So yes.

So the number of revolutions would be 2500, which is option D.

But wait, the options include option C as 3536 and option D as 2500.

So according to this calculation, the answer should be D) 2500.

But wait, let me think again. The problem says the proton undergoes two accelerations to reach 950 MeV. Oh wait, that wording might have confused me. The original problem says "undergoes two accelerations in the accelerator to reach the kinetic energy T1=950MeV." That doesn't make sense because two accelerations would give 2 * e * U0, which is 380 keV, way less than 950 MeV.

Wait, that must be a misstatement. Perhaps it's the number of revolutions, not accelerations. Or perhaps it's a typo, and it means that the proton is accelerated twice per revolution. Well, regardless, according to my earlier reasoning, the answer would be D) 2500.

But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming each revolution gives 380 keV. Let's think again.

Alternatively, perhaps each revolution provides one acceleration, so each revolution gives 190 keV, leading to 950,000 / 190 ≈ 5000 revolutions, but that's not an option. Hmm, no.

Wait, perhaps each acceleration occurs every half-revolution, so each revolution has one acceleration. So the energy per revolution is 190 keV. Then 950,000 / 190 ≈ 5000, but that's not an option either.

Wait, but earlier calculation said that each step is 190 keV, each revolution has two steps, so per rev: 380 keV. So 950,000 / 380 ≈ 2500.

Which is option D.

But wait, let me think about the phase shift. The initial phase is Phi0=pi/4. Does that affect the number of revolutions? I don't think so. Because the phase shift determines the initial condition, but the total number of revolutions is determined by the total energy and the energy per revolution.

So, I think the answer is D) 2500.


To determine the number of revolutions a proton makes in a synchrocyclotron, we analyze the problem as follows:

The proton is injected with negligible initial kinetic energy (\(T \approx 0\)) and is accelerated by the alternating voltage \(U(t) = U_0 \cos[2\pi \nu(\alpha)t + \Phi_0]\), where \(U_0 = 190 \, \text{kV}\) and \(\Phi_0 = \frac{\pi}{4}\). The goal is to reach a kinetic energy \(T_1 = 950 \, \text{MeV}\).

In a synchrocyclotron, the proton is accelerated each time it passes through the gap between the electrodes. Each revolution corresponds to two acceleration steps, as the proton completes half a revolution in the gap. The energy gained per acceleration step is approximately \(e \cdot U_0\), where \(e\) is the proton's charge (\(e \approx 1.6 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C}\)).

### Energy per Revolution
Each revolution involves two acceleration steps, so the energy gained per revolution is:
\[
\text{Energy per revolution} = 2 \cdot e \cdot U_0
\]
Substituting \(e \cdot U_0 = (1.6 \times 10^{-19}) \cdot (1.9 \times 10^5) \approx 3.04 \times 10^{-14} \, \text{J}\), which corresponds to \(190 \, \text{keV}\). Thus:
\[
\text{Energy per revolution} = 2 \cdot 190 \, \text{keV} = 380 \, \text{keV}
\]

### Total Number of Revolutions
The total kinetic energy to be reached is \(T_1 = 950 \, \text{MeV} = 950,000 \, \text{keV}\). The number of revolutions \(N\) is given by:
\[
N = \frac{T_1}{\text{Energy per revolution}} = \frac{950,000}{380} \approx 2500
\]

### Conclusion
The proton makes approximately 2500 revolutions in the synchrocyclotron to reach the kinetic energy of \(950 \, \text{MeV}\). This matches option D.

Answer: D
