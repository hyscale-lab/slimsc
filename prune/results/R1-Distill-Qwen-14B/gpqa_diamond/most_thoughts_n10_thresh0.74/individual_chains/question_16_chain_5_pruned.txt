Okay, so I've got this question about optical activity, and I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to think it through. Optical activity means that a compound can rotate plane-polarized light, right? That happens when there's chirality in the molecule—so at least one chiral center or a different kind of asymmetry like a planar chirality.

The question lists seven compounds, and I need to determine how many are optically active. Let me go through each one by one.

1. **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**
   Let's visualize this. The structure is CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2. Wait, wait, no. Wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2Cl? Wait, no. Wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3, right? So 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would be Cl–C(CH3)=CH2–CH3? Or maybe the structure is CH2Cl–C(CH3)=CH2. Hmm, but wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl on the first carbon. So the structure is Cl–C(=CH2)–CH(CH3)? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.

   Alternatively, maybe it's CH2Cl–CH(CH3)–CH2–, but that's but-1-ene. Wait, but but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl on the first carbon: Cl–CH2–CH(CH3)–CH2? No, wait, but it's but-1-ene, so it's CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl attached to the first carbon. So structure: Cl–CH2–CH(CH3)–CH2–? Wait, but wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2Cl. Wait, no, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. 1-chloro would be Cl on the first carbon, so the structure is Cl–CH2–CH(CH3)–CH2–? Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

   Alternatively, perhaps it's CH2Cl–CH2–CH(CH3)–CH2? No. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps it's CH2Cl–C(CH3)=CH2. So the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the molecule is CH2Cl–C(CH3)=CH2. So, in this case, the double bond is between C1 and C2. Wait, but if the substituents on each end of the double bond are different, does that lead to a possibility of E/Z isomerism? Oh, wait, but the question states it's the Z isomer.

   But for optical activity, I think about if the molecule has a chiral center. Let's see: each of the carbons in the double bond? No, because double bonds don't have chiral centers. Wait, but in this molecule, is there any chiral center? Looking at each carbon: the first carbon is CH2Cl, which is attached to a double bond. The second carbon is C(CH3), which is connected to Cl on one side, CH3 on another,
