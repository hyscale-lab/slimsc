Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a supernova and reference frames. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on relativity, but let's try to work through this step by step.

The question says that a part of the supernova ejecta is moving directly towards the center of the Galaxy. Both the ejecta and the Galaxy are in inertial frames. From the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. Wait, so in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards the center at 60,000 km/s, right? Because in different frames, velocities can be opposite. But I think I need to be careful here.

The problem is asking how much distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. So, the time given is in the ejecta's reference frame, but we need the distance in the Galaxy's frame. That sounds like a problem involving time dilation, maybe? Or perhaps velocity addition because of relativity.

Wait, but wait. If the ejecta and the Galaxy are both inertial, but moving relative to each other, then we might need to use the Lorentz transformation equations. I'm a bit confused about which frame is moving relative to which. Let me clarify.

In the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving at 60,000 km/s towards the ejecta. So, from the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is coming towards it at 60,000 km/s. Because velocities reverse when you switch frames. So, the velocity u in the Galaxy's frame is 60,000 km/s towards the center.

Wait, no. Let me think. If the Galaxy is moving at v towards the ejecta in the ejecta's frame, then in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta would be moving at v towards the Galaxy, right? So yes, the ejecta's speed in the Galaxy's frame is 60,000 km/s.

But wait, hold on. Because of relativity, velocities don't just simply switch signs. Oh, but wait, in this case, the problem states both are inertial, so we can use classical addition perhaps? Or maybe not, because 60,000 km/s is a significant fraction of the speed of light. Let me calculate that.

The speed of light is approximately 300,000 km/s.
