Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. The question involves particles being collided in a detector, producing new particles that move at ultra-relativistic speeds. The main point is about the Lorentz factor and how it affects the number of particles reaching the detector's inner walls.

Hmm, let me read it again. The setup is that when particles are collided, new particles are produced. These new particles decay quickly and travel at ultra-relativistic velocities with a Lorentz factor of about 20 on average. Right now, one third of these particles reach the detector's inner walls. The detector has a radius of 30 meters. The question is asking, what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of the particles reach the walls instead?

Wait, so the current Lorentz factor is 20, and only one third (around 33%) make it. We want to increase that to two-thirds (about 66.67%). So we need a higher Lorentz factor because... wait, no, higher speed would mean they move farther, right? Because Lorentz factor is gamma, which increases with velocity. Oh right, so higher gamma would mean the particles can travel further before decaying or before being detected.

But wait, the key here is the relation between the particles' lifetime (from their decay) and the time it takes for them to reach the detector walls. So, particles that are moving faster (higher gamma) will have a longer lifetime as observed in the lab frame. Because from the lab frame, their lifetime is dilated by a factor of gamma. So, if gamma increases, their lifetime increases, allowing them to travel further. So a larger gamma should mean more particles reach the detector.

Wait, but in the question, the initial situation is that with gamma=20, about one third reach the wall. So when gamma increases, more would reach. So the problem is asking for a gamma that gives two-thirds reaching the wall.

But how to relate gamma to the fraction reaching the detector? Let's think about the proper time of the particles. The proper lifetime (tau) is the lifetime in the particle's rest frame. The lab frame sees their lifetime as gamma * tau.

The particles are produced at the center of the detector, so the distance they need to travel to reach the inner walls is 30 meters. But wait, the particles are moving at a velocity v, so the time they have to reach the wall is t = distance / velocity.

Wait, but the time they can exist before decaying is tau * gamma. So the time they take to reach the wall must be less than tau * gamma for them to make it. So the condition is (distance) / v <= tau * gamma.

Wait, velocity v is related to gamma. For ultra-relativistic particles, v ≈ c. So the time t ≈ (30 m) / c.

So t = 30 / (3e8 m/s) = 1e-7 seconds. Is that right? Well, 3e8 m/s is c, so 30m is 30/(3e8) = 1e-7 seconds, yeah.

But wait, tau is the proper lifetime. So in the lab
