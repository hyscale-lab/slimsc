Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here. Let me try to understand what it's asking. It's about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution. Hmm, orthophosphate is PO4^3-, right?

The solution has a volume of 200.00 cm³, which I can convert to liters because molarity is in mol/L. So 200 cm³ is 0.2 liters. Got it.

They added 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O. Oh wait, the molar masses are given: 136.09 g/mol for KH2PO4 and 177.99 g/mol for the sodium hydrogen phosphate. So I'll need to calculate the moles of each.

Let me start with KH2PO4. Moles = mass / molar mass. So 1.00 g divided by 136.09 g/mol. Let me compute that. 1 / 136.09 is approximately 0.00734 moles. Wait, let me be precise. 136.09 is around 136, so 1/136 is about 0.00735. So 0.00734 mol.

Then Na2HPO4·2H2O: 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol. Let me calculate that. 1 / 177.99 is approximately 0.005607 mol. Wait, wait, 178 is roughly 178, so 1/178 is about 0.00562. So around 0.005607 mol.

Now, what do these salts dissociate into? KH2PO4 is K+ and H2PO4^- right? Because K is a +1 ion and H2PO4^- is -1. So each mole of KH2PO4 gives one mole of H2PO4^-.

Na2HPO4·2H2O: Na is +1, so Na2 would be +2. The HPO4^2- is -2. So each mole of Na2HPO4 gives one mole of HPO4^2-.

So in the solution, we have H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- ions. Wait, but the question is about orthophosphate ions, PO4^3-. So how does that form?

I think these are part of the phosphate buffer system. Phosphoric acid, H3PO4, can donate three protons. It has three dissociation steps:

H3PO4 ↔ H+ + H2PO4^-    Ka1 = 7.5e-3
H2PO4^- ↔ H+ + HPO4^2-   Ka2 = 6.2e-8
HPO4^2- ↔ H+ + PO4^3-    Ka3 = 1.8e-12

So, the question is about the concentration of PO4^3-.

But wait, I
