Okay, so I've got this NMR question in front of me. Hmm, let me try to think it through. The question is about a mixture of two aromatic compounds with the molecular formula C10H14. The NMR shows two singlets around 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio, and three singlets at 2.2 ppm in a 2:1:1 ratio. I need to figure out which two compounds are present from the given options.

First, I should probably think about the structures of the given options. All of them are tetramethylbenzenes except option C, which has diethyl groups. Let me list them:

1. 1,2,4,5-Tetramethylbenzene: So that's para positions with two methyl groups on adjacent carbons. So the structure would have methyl groups at positions 1,2,4,5. Wait, benzene is a ring with six positions. So 1,2,4,5 would mean four methyl groups, two pairs adjacent, right? So maybe it's similar to 1,2-dimethyl and 4,5-dimethyl, making the structure kind of a meta arrangement? Or wait, 1 and 2 are adjacent, then positions 4 and 5 are adjacent as well. So the structure would have two pairs of adjacent methyl groups, across from each other. Like, perhaps, 1,2 and 4,5 being opposite each other.

2. 1,2,3,5-Tetramethylbenzene: So positions 1,2,3,5 have methyl groups. Let me visualize that. Oh wait, benzene is a six-membered ring. So 1,2,3 are three consecutive positions, then 5 is next to 6 and 4? So maybe the structure is a bit crowded with methyl groups in three consecutive positions and one opposite?

3. 1,2,3,4-Tetramethylbenzene: That's like 1,2,3,4 positions. So four consecutive methyl groups on the benzene ring. That's a para arrangement? Wait, no, 1-2-3-4 would be four in a row, so the structure would be 1,2,3,4-tetra. That's a lot of adjacent methyl groups.

4. 1,4-diethylbenzene: So the benzene has ethyl groups at positions 1 and 4. Diethyl would mean two ethyl groups, each attached to the benzene. So that's a 1,4-disubstituted benzene with two ethyl groups.

Now, the spectrum has two singlets in the aromatic region (around 6.7 ppm) in a 1:1 ratio. Since it's a 1:1 mixture, each compound contributes their own signals. But wait, if each compound has the same number of equivalent protons, their signals would add up. Wait, but if each has different aromatic protons, maybe they each contribute a singlet each.

Wait, but the aromatic region has two singlets. So maybe each compound has a singlet in the aromatic region. But in a 1:1 mixture, so each singlet would be the same area, since each is present in the same amount.

Wait, but for each compound, the aromatic protons would need to be equivalent, so that their NMR signals are singlets. So each compound in the mixture must have a structure where all the aromatic protons are equivalent, leading to a singlet.

Wait, but that's tricky because benzene rings with substituents usually have more than one set of protons unless it's a highly symmetrical structure.

Wait, think about when all the aromatic protons are equivalent. That's the case when the substituents are arranged symmetrically, such as in para positions. For example, if a benzene has two substituents opposite each other (para), then the ring becomes symmetric, and the remaining protons would also be equivalent.

Wait, but in the case of tetramethylbenzenes, perhaps only certain substitution patterns make all the aromatic
