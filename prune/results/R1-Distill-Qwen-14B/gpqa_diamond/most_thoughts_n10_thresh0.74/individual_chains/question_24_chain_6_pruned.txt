Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because it seems a bit involved, but I'll try to break it down step by step. Let's see... the question is about some mixtures undergoing reactions and what that tells us about their composition. Hmm.

The problem starts by talking about an equimolar mixture X of two liquids that decolorizes bromine water. I remember that decolorizing bromine usually involves addition reactions, like alkenes or alkynes reacting with Br2. So the mixture X must contain compounds with double or triple bonds. But wait, the question also says that there are no conjugated multiple bonds in the molecules of the compounds of mixture X. So each compound has isolated double or triple bonds, not conjugated. That's an important point.

Next, when mixture X is treated with platinum when heated, it undergoes a reaction leading to mixture Y of two other liquids. The reaction is a disproportionation, which means one substance is both oxidized and reduced. So X must have a compound that can undergo such a reaction. Platinum as a catalyst usually suggests hydrogenation or perhaps dehydrogenation. Wait, but the mention is about heating. Oh, wait, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation or something else? Hmm, no, more likely, since it's treated with Pt, it's a catalytic process. Oh, wait, maybe it's a hydrogenation reaction because platinum is a catalyst for hydrogenation.

Wait, but the product Y is formed by disproportionation. Hmm, which reactions involve disproportionation with platinum as a catalyst? One possibility is that X contains a diene, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the cleavage of a triple bond. Wait, another thought: Could this be the dehydrohalogenation? No, wait, that's more about elimination.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a mixture of something that can undergo hydrogenation in such a way to produce a disproportionation. Oh wait, maybe one of the components in X is an alkene that hydrogenates, but then how does that lead to a disproportionation? Hmm, maybe X is a mixture of a di-substituted alkene and another compound. Wait, perhaps the reaction is the cleavage of a diene with H2 and Pt, leading to smaller alkenes. But then, how does that involve disproportionation?

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here
