Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question says that a chemist performed two reactions using two different reducing agents. The products from both reactions are enantiomers of each other, specifically (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. The task is to determine which starting materials (A and B) were used for each reaction.

The options given are A, B, C, D, each pairing two compounds. All the options have the same two compounds but with different configurations. So, the key is to figure out how the starting material's stereochemistry affects the product's configuration based on the reducing agents used.

Hmm, I remember that when you have a carbonyl group adjacent to an ether, like in a ketone or something, certain reducing agents can lead to different products based on the mechanism. Oh wait, LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, and BH3 is also a reducing agent but perhaps works differently. Wait, in the context of ketones, both are used for reduction, but maybe the stereochemistry of the starting material plays a role in the product's configuration.

Wait, another thought: maybe this is about the reduction of an epoxide or some cyclic ether. Or perhaps it's about the reduction of a ketone to an alcohol, but that might not fit. Wait, the product is a tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. Pyran is a six-membered ring with one oxygen. Tetrahydro suggests that it's a partially saturated ring. So, the product is a cyclic hemiacetal or something similar.

Wait, 4-ethyl suggests that there's an ethyl group on the fourth carbon. Let me think about the structure of 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. The ring would be five-membered? No, pyran is six-membered. So, it's a six-membered ring with an oxygen, and the ring is partially hydrogenated, so maybe two double bonds are present or something else.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ketone. Oh, wait, maybe the reaction involves the reduction of a cyclic ketone. Let me think about that.

Wait, another approach: the product is a tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. That structure has a five-membered ring because pyran is six, but the '2H' suggests that there are two hydrogen atoms in the ring, maybe in a certain position. Wait, maybe it's a five-membered ring with an oxygen, like a cyclic hemiacetal.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the mechanism of the reduction. So, for the first reaction, A is treated with LiBH4 and H+ to get (R)-enantiomer. The second reaction uses B with BH3 and H+ to get the (S) enantiomer.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused about how the reducing agents would affect the stereochemistry. I remember that in some reductions, especially when the carbonyl is part of a cyclic structure, the reducing agent can influence whether the product is a racemic mixture or has a specific configuration.

Wait, LiBH4
