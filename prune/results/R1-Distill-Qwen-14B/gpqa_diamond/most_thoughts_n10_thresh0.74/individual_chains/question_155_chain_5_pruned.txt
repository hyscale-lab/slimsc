Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to find the uncertainty in P_z, given that the system is in an eigenstate of P_x with a specific eigenvalue. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.

First, I remember that the uncertainty in an observable, like P_z, when the system is in a state |ψ>, is calculated using the formula ΔP_z = sqrt(⟨ψ|P_z^2|ψ⟩ - ⟨ψ|P_z|ψ⟩²). Right, that's the standard formula for uncertainty in quantum mechanics.

The given state is a column vector: (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). I'll call this |ψ>. So, ψ = [ -1/2; 1/sqrt(2); -1/2 ].

I need to compute ⟨ψ| P_z |ψ⟩ and ⟨ψ| P_z² |ψ⟩.

Wait, what's P_z? Oh, here it is. The matrix for P_z is:
Row 1: [ħ, 0, 0]
Row 2: [0, 0, 0]
Row 3: [0, 0, -ħ]

Wait, no, more accurately, the matrix has rows:
First row: (ħ, 0, 0)
Second: (0,0,0)
Third: (0,0,-ħ)

Wait, no, let me double-check. The matrix is written as:

P_z matrix:
First row: (ħ, 0, 0)
Second row: (0, 0, 0)
Third row: (0, 0, -ħ)

So, it's a diagonal matrix with ħ, 0, -ħ along the diagonal.

So, when we apply P_z to a state vector, it acts diagonally. For example, P_z |ψ> would be:

First component: ħ * (-1/2)
Second component: 0 * (1/sqrt(2))
Third component: (-ħ) * (-1/2)

So, P_z |ψ> = [ (-ħ/2), 0, (ħ/2) ].

Wait, but to compute ⟨ψ| P_z |ψ⟩, I need to compute the inner product of ψ with P_z acting on ψ.
