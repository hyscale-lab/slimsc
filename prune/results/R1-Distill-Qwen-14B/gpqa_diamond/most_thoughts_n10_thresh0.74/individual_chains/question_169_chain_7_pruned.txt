Okay, so I have this physics problem here about nuclear decay, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it carefully.

The question is about a decay process where two nucleons of flavor A turn into two of flavor B, and emit two lighter particles E and V. The reaction is 2A → 2B + 2E + 2V. They mention that the total energy spectrum of E is continuous with an endpoint Q.

Then there's a variant where instead of two V particles, it emits one exotic, massless particle M. So the reaction becomes 2A → 2B + 2E + M. The question is, how does the energy spectrum of E change?

Hmm, I remember that in decay processes, the nature of the emitted particles affects whether the energy spectrum is continuous or discrete. For example, beta decay emits electrons and antineutrinos, and the electrons have a continuous spectrum because the neutrino can carry away varying amounts of energy.

Wait, in the original decay, there are two E and two V particles. The E's have a continuous spectrum. So in that case, maybe the E's are the ones that have varying energy because the V's take away some energy as well.

In the variant, they emit M instead of two V's. Since M is massless, that's probably a photon or a neutrino or something similar. Massless particles carry energy and momentum but have no rest mass.

So in the original case, the two V's would have some rest mass. When they are emitted along with the E particles, the energy available (Q) is shared among all of them. The E particles' energies would vary because the V's can take different amounts, leading to a continuous spectrum.

In the variant, replacing two V's with a single massless M. How does this change things? Wait, the original decay had four particles: 2 E and 2 V. The variant has 2 E and 1 M.

Wait, so the total number of particles is changing. Or maybe in the original, it's two E and two V, so four particles. The variant is two E and one M, so three particles. But the key is how the presence of M affects the energy spectrum of E.

So, think about conservation of energy and momentum. In the original decay, the E and V particles share the available energy, which leads to a continuous spectrum because the energy can vary as the V's take different amounts. For instance, in beta decay, the electron's energy is continuous because the neutrino's energy can vary.

In the variant, the M is massless. So, when you have energy and momentum, how does that affect the E particles?

Wait, let me think about the phase space. If you have more particles, the energy can be distributed more ways, leading to continuous spectra. If you have fewer particles, perhaps the energy distribution is different.

In the original case, the E's are emitted along with two V's. Since V's have mass, the energy can be split among all four particles. So the E's have a continuous distribution.

In the variant, the E
