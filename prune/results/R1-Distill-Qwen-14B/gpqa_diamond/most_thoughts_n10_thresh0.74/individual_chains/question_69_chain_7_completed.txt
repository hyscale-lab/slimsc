Okay, so I need to solve this physics problem. Let me read it carefully again.

The problem is about the CERN Bubble Chamber and a decay process. The particle X⁰ decays into Y⁺ and Z⁻. The proper lifetime of X⁰ is given as τ₀ = 8e-16 seconds. The question is asking about the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. The energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27 GeV, and the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV.

Hmm, okay. So I remember that when particles decay in a detector, the lifetime affects how far they travel before decaying. The proper lifetime is the lifetime measured in the particle's rest frame. But when the particle is moving, we have to consider time dilation due to special relativity.

The formula I think I should use is the relativistic gamma factor, γ. Gamma is equal to the total energy of the particle divided by its rest mass energy. Because E = γ m c², and m is the rest mass.

So gamma (γ) is E / (m c²). Since E is given in GeV, and m is in GeV/c², perhaps the c² will cancel out. Let me think about the units.

Wait, in particle physics, we often use natural units where c=1, so E (in GeV) would just be γ m (in GeV/c²) times c², but the units might complicate it. Alternatively, perhaps since the mass is given in GeV, and the energy is also in GeV, the calculation might be straightforward.

So, for X⁰, E is 27 GeV, and m is 3.41 GeV. So γ = E / m = 27 / 3.41 ≈ let me compute that.

27 divided by 3.41. Let me calculate 3.41 times 7 is about 23.87. 3.41 * 8 is 27.28, which is a bit over 27. So 27 /3.41 is approximately 7.918, or about 7.92. So gamma is about 7.92.

Now, the lifetime as observed in the lab frame is dilated. The proper lifetime is τ₀, so the dilated lifetime τ is γ τ₀. So τ = 7.92 * 8e-16 s. Let me compute that.

7.92 * 8 = 63.36. So 63.36e-16 s. Which is 6.336e-15 seconds.

But wait, what's the significance of this? The particle's lifetime is longer in the lab frame, so it can travel further before decaying. The distance it travels is given by the speed multiplied by the lifetime. So the decay length L is v * τ.

But what is the velocity of the particle? Well, particles at high energies are moving at speeds close to the speed of light. So v ≈ c. Since gamma is about 7.92, which is a high gamma, so beta is v/c ≈ sqrt(1 - (1/gamma²)) ? Wait, another formula: beta = v/c = sqrt(1 - (1/γ²)).

Wait, actually, beta is v/c, and gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - beta²). So beta = sqrt(1 - (1/γ²)}.

So let me compute beta. γ is about 7.92, so 1/γ² is about 1/(62.7264) ≈ 0.01595.

So 1 - 0.01595 = 0.98405. The square root of that is sqrt(0.98405) ≈ 0.992, so beta is approximately 0.992c. So v ≈ 0.992c.

So now, the decay length L is v * τ. So L = 0.992c * τ. We have τ as 6.336e-15 s.

c is approximately 3e8 m/s. So 0.992 * 3e8 ≈ 2.976e8 m/s.

So L = 2.976e8 m/s * 6.336e-15 s.

Multiply these together: 2.976e8 * 6.336e-15 = (2.976 * 6.336) * 1e-7.

Compute 2.976 * 6.336. Let me see:

Approximately 3 * 6.336 = 18.993, but since 2.976 is a bit less than 3, it's about 18.993 * (2.976/3) = 18.993 * 0.992 ≈ 18.8.

Wait, more accurately:

2.976 * 6.336 = ?

Let me compute it step by step.

2.976 * 6 = 17.856
2.976 * 0.336 = let's see: 2.976 * 0.3 is 0.8928, 2.976 * 0.036 is 0.107136. Sum is ~0.8928 + 0.107136 = 0.999936.

So total is 17.856 + 0.999936 ≈ 18.855936.

So 18.855936e-7 meters. Which is 1.8855936e-6 meters. Approximately 1.886e-6 m.

Wait, but the problem is talking about the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. So what determines the percentage of decays observed?

I remember that the number of particles that decay within a certain length depends on the decay probability. The decay follows an exponential law. The probability that a particle decays within a length L is 1 - e^(-L / λ), where λ is the mean decay length.

But in this case, the question is about the minimum resolution required to observe at least 30% of the decays. So perhaps the minimum resolution is related to the mean decay length, or the most probable decay length.

Wait, but the problem says 'minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays'. So perhaps the idea is that the detector must be able to resolve the decay vertex, which happens over a certain length. So if the decay length is too small compared to the resolution, you can't see it. Wait, perhaps the opposite: if the decay length is larger than the resolution, you can more easily see it.

Wait, no. If the decay length is small, say, smaller than the detector's resolution, then the particle decays very close to the production point, so the detector can't resolve it. Or perhaps, the minimum resolution is such that it can distinguish the decay point from the production point. So the minimum resolution is the length beyond which the detector can detect a decay. So, to observe a decay, the decay must occur a certain distance away from the point of production, which can be detected with the given resolution.

Alternatively, perhaps the question relates to the fraction of particles that decay within a certain length, which relates to the detector's resolution. So, maybe the minimum resolution is the length such that 30% of the particles decay within that length, and the detector's resolution must be good enough to see that.

Wait, I'm a bit confused now. Let me think again.

The proper lifetime is τ₀. The decay length in the lab frame is L = γ β c τ₀. So the average decay length is L = γ β c τ₀.

The probability that a particle decays within a certain length x is P(x) = 1 - e^(-x/L).

So if the detector's resolution is such that it can only reliably detect decays that occur beyond a certain length x, then a fraction P(x) of the decays will be observed.

Wait, but the question states that the detector's resolution must allow observing at least 30% of the decays. So I think that 30% of the particles decay within a length x, and the detector's resolution must be such that it can measure x, so that it can detect that a decay has occurred. Or perhaps, the minimum resolution is the length where 30% have decayed, so the detector must have a resolution good enough to measure that.

Wait, no, perhaps the question is the other way around. The resolution is the uncertainty in the position measurement. So, if the decay occurs at a distance x, and the resolution is δ, then you can only see the decay if x is larger than δ. Or, more accurately, if the decay occurs within a region that the detector can resolve, so that you can distinguish it from the production point.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the minimum distance required for the decay to happen so that the detector can see it. The minimum resolution would be the length where the probability is 30%, meaning that 30% of the decays happen beyond that point, and the detector can see it.

Wait, this is a bit confusing. Let me think again.

The decay length is L = γ β c τ₀. The mean decay length is L.

The probability that the particle decays at a distance x is given by the decay distribution: P(x) = (1/L) e^(-x/L).

Wait, no, that's the probability density. The cumulative distribution is P(x) = 1 - e^(-x/L), which is the probability that the decay occurs before x.

So, to have at least 30% of the decays observed, we need to find x where P(x) = 0.30.

So 0.30 = 1 - e^(-x/L) → e^(-x/L) = 0.70 → -x/L = ln(0.70) → x = - L ln(0.70).

Compute ln(0.7) → approximately -0.35667.

So x = L * 0.35667.

So x ≈ 0.35667 * L.

So substituting L:

L = gamma * beta * c * tau_0.

We have already calculated gamma as approximately 7.92, beta as approximately 0.992.

So L = 7.92 * 0.992 * c * tau_0.

c is 3e8 m/s.

tau_0 is 8e-16 s.

So L = 7.92 * 0.992 * 3e8 * 8e-16.

Let me compute this step by step.

First, multiply 7.92 and 0.992: 7.92 * 0.992 ≈ 7.866.

Then, 7.866 * 3e8 = 23.598e8 = 2.3598e9.

Then, 2.3598e9 * 8e-16 = 2.3598e9 * 8e-16 = (2.3598 *8) * 1e-7.

2.3598 * 8 ≈ 18.8784.

So L ≈ 18.8784e-7 meters, which is 1.88784e-6 meters, or approximately 1.888e-6 m.

Wait, that's the mean decay length. But earlier, I thought x was 0.35667 * L.

So x = 0.35667 * 1.888e-6 m ≈ 0.35667 * 1.888e-6.

Let me compute that: 0.35667 * 1.888e-6 ≈ approx. 0.35667 * 1.888 is about 0.35667 * 1.888 ≈ let's compute 0.35667 * 1.8 = 0.642, and 0.35667 * 0.088 = ~0.0314. So total about 0.6734. So 0.6734e-6 meters → 6.734e-7 m.

Wait, but that's the length x where 30% of the particles decay beyond it. So, the detector's resolution must be able to measure this x, so that it can detect at least 30% of the decays.

Wait, but I'm not sure if I'm getting the question right. The question says: What minimum resolution is needed to observe at least 30% of the decays.

Wait, perhaps the minimum resolution is the distance x where 30% of the decays have occurred. Because if the detector can only resolve decays that are beyond that distance, then it would only see 30% of them. Or if the resolution is equal to x, then 30% are beyond that, so you can detect them.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimum resolution is the distance x such that the probability of decaying within x is 30%. Then, the detector must have a resolution better than that to see at least 30% of the decays.

Wait, perhaps the detector's resolution is the uncertainty in the position measurement. So, if the decay occurs at a position x, but the detector can only measure within an uncertainty δ, then you can only see the decay if x is larger than δ, so that the decay point is distinguishable from the production point.

Wait, that might make sense. So the minimum δ is such that the probability of the decay occurring beyond δ is 30%.

So the question is asking for δ, the minimum resolution needed, so that P(x > δ) = 0.30.

Which is the same as saying 1 - e^(-δ / L) = 0.30 → e^(-δ/L) = 0.70 → δ = L * ln(1/0.70) ≈ L * 0.35667.

Wait, no, because 1 - e^(-δ/L) = 0.30 → e^(-δ/L) = 0.70 → -δ/L = ln(0.70) → δ = -L ln(0.70) ≈ L * 0.35667.

So δ is approximately 0.35667 * L.

Which, as calculated earlier, L is about 1.888e-6 m.

So δ ≈ 0.35667 * 1.888e-6 ≈ 6.73e-7 meters, or 6.73e-7 m.

Wait, but let me check the calculation again.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, maybe I got the equation wrong. Let me think again.

The probability that the decay occurs beyond δ is 0.30, so:

P(x > δ) = e^(-δ/L) ) = 0.30.

So, e^(-δ/L) = 0.30 → -δ/L = ln(0.30) → δ = -L ln(0.30).

Compute ln(0.30) → approximately -1.20397.

So δ = L * 1.20397.

Wait, that's different. So earlier I thought it was 0.35667, but perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, no, wait. Let's see:

The CDF is P(x < X) = 1 - e^(-X/L). So if we need the probability that x > δ to be 30%, that's P(x > δ) = 0.30.

Which is equal to e^(-δ/L) = 0.30.

So, solving for δ:

δ = - L ln(0.30) ≈ L * (1.20397).

So, delta is approximately 1.204 * L.

Wait, let's compute that.

Earlier, L was 1.887e-6 m.

So 1.204 * 1.887e-6 = ?

1.204 * 1.887 = approx.

1.887 * 1.2 = 2.2644.

1.887 * 0.004 = 0.007548.

So total approx 2.2644 + 0.007548 = 2.2719.

So delta ≈ 2.2719e-6 m.

Wait, but that's approximately 2.27e-6 m, which is 2.27 micrometers.

Looking back at the options, option A is 2.08e-6 m, which is about 2.08 micrometers.

Hmm, close. So perhaps I made a miscalculation in the steps.

Wait, let me recalculate L accurately.

We have:

gamma = E/(m c²) → but in natural units, E and m are in GeV, and c=1, so gamma is 27 GeV / 3.41 GeV = 27/3.41 ≈ 7.9178.

Beta is sqrt(1 - (1/gamma²)).

So 1/gamma² = 1/(7.9178)^2 ≈ 1/62.7 → 0.01595.

So 1 - 0.01595 = 0.98405.

Beta = sqrt(0.98405) ≈ 0.9920.

So L = gamma * beta * c * tau_0.

Gamma is 7.9178, beta 0.9920.

Compute gamma * beta: 7.9178 * 0.9920 ≈ 7.865.

c is 3e8 m/s.

tau_0 is 8e-16 s.

So L = 7.865 * 3e8 * 8e-16.

Compute 7.865 * 3e8 = 23.595e8 = 2.3595e9.

Multiply by 8e-16: 2.3595e9 *8e-16 = (2.3595 *8) * 1e-7.

2.3595 *8 = 18.876.

So L = 18.876e-7 m = 1.8876e-6 m.

So L is approximately 1.8876e-6 meters.

Now, delta is L * 1.20397 → 1.8876e-6 * 1.20397 ≈ ?

1.8876 * 1.20397.

Let me compute 1.8876 * 1.2 = 2.26512.

1.8876 * 0.00397 ≈ approx 0.00747.

Total ≈ 2.26512 + 0.00747 ≈ 2.2726e-6 meters.

So delta is approximately 2.2726e-6 m.

Looking at the options, the closest is option A: 2.08e-6 m.

But wait, perhaps I made an error in the formula. Let me double-check the probability.

We want the probability that the particle decays beyond delta to be 30%. So P(x > delta) = 0.3.

Which is equal to exp(-delta/L) = 0.3.

So delta = - L * ln(0.3) = L * ln(10/3) ≈ L * 1.20397.

Wait, but 1.20397 is correct.

But according to the calculation, delta is about 2.27e-6 m, but option A is 2.08e-6 m. Hmm, perhaps my approximation is not exact enough.

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma and beta more accurately.

Wait, gamma is 27 / 3.41 → let's compute that exactly.

3.41 * 7 = 23.87.

27 - 23.87 = 3.13.

3.41 * 0.9 = 3.069. So 3.41 * 7.9 = 27.259.

Wait, 3.41 * 7 = 23.87, 3.41 * 0.9 = 3.069 → 23.87 +3.069 = 26.939. Close to 27. So 7.9 + (0.061 /3.41).

0.061 /3.41 ≈ 0.0179. So gamma is approximately 7.9179.

So gamma = E/m = 7.9179.

Now, beta = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma²)).

1/gamma² = 1/(7.9179)^2 → compute 7.9179 squared.

7.9179 *7.9179: Let's compute 7.9 *7.9 = 62.41. Then, for more accuracy, 7.9179^2 = (7.9 + 0.0179)^2 → 7.9^2 + 2*7.9*0.0179 + 0.0179^2 → 62.41 + 0.27482 + 0.00032 → ~62.68514.

So 1/gamma² ≈ 1/62.68514 ≈ 0.015953.

So 1 - 0.015953 = 0.984047.

The square root of 0.984047. Let's compute that.

We can approximate sqrt(0.984047).

We know that 0.99^2 = 0.9801, 0.992^2 = 0.984064.

Wait, 0.992^2 = (0.99 +0.002)^2 = 0.99^2 + 2*0.99*0.002 + 0.002^2 = 0.9801 + 0.00396 + 0.000004 = 0.984064.

So sqrt(0.984047) is very close to 0.992.

Wait, 0.992^2 is 0.984064, which is slightly larger than 0.984047. So sqrt(0.984047) is slightly less than 0.992.

So perhaps approximately 0.99199.

So beta is approximately 0.99199.

So L = gamma * beta * c * tau_0.

So 7.9179 * 0.99199 ≈ let me compute that.

7.9179 * 0.99199 = approx.

Let me compute 7.9179 * 0.99 = 7.8487.

7.9179 * 0.00199 ≈ approx 0.01578.

So total approx 7.8487 + 0.01578 ≈ 7.8645.

So L = 7.8645 * 3e8 m/s * 8e-16 s.

Compute 7.8645 *3e8 = 23.5935e8 = 2.35935e9.

Multiply by 8e-16: 2.35935e9 *8e-16 = (2.35935 *8) *1e-7.

2.35935 *8 = 18.8748.

So L = 18.8748e-7 m = 1.88748e-6 m.

So delta = L * ln(10/3) ≈ 1.88748e-6 * 1.20397.

Compute 1.88748 * 1.20397.

Let me compute 1.88748 * 1.2 = 2.265.

1.88748 * 0.00397 ≈ 0.00747.

So total delta ≈ 2.272e-6 m.

Wait, so 2.27e-6 m, but the option is 2.08e-6 m.

Hmm, I'm a bit off. Let me think again. Did I make a mistake in computing ln(1/0.3) or in the approach?

Wait, perhaps I should approach it differently. Maybe the problem is not about the cumulative probability but about the mean path length.

Wait, if the question is about the minimum resolution needed to observe 30% of the decays, perhaps it's the decay length multiplied by 0.3.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think about the setup. The Bubble Chamber is used to detect particles that decay after moving some distance from their production point. The chamber's resolution is the smallest distance it can detect. So to detect the decay, the decay must happen outside the resolution. So, if the decay occurs at a distance x, and the resolution is δ, then x must be greater than δ for the decay to be detected.

So the probability that x > δ is the fraction of decays observed. So to have 30% observed, P(x > δ) = 0.3.

Which, as before, requires δ = L * ln(1/0.7) ≈ L * 0.35667.

Wait, no, no, wait. Let me correct that.

Wait, P(x > δ) = e^(-δ/L) = 0.3 → δ = L * ln(1/0.3) ≈ L * 1.20397.

Hmm, but that gives delta as about 2.27e-6 m, which isn't one of the options. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the question is not about the decay probability but about the time it takes for the decay to happen. Or perhaps I'm confusing the proper lifetime and the observed lifetime.

Wait, perhaps the minimum resolution is the distance the particle travels in the proper lifetime. Because if the particle's lifetime is τ₀, then in its rest frame, it can't travel any significant distance. But in the lab frame, it can. Hmm, no, that's not relevant.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the minimum resolution needed to resolve the decay, which is related to how much the particle has moved in its own lifetime. But that seems less likely.

Wait, another approach: The minimum distance that the particle must travel before decaying so that the detector can see it. So perhaps it's the distance that the particle travels in its own lifetime, without considering time dilation.

But that would be x = c * tau_0 * beta. Because in the lab frame, the particle's lifetime is longer, so it's gamma * tau_0.

Wait, so without considering time dilation, the decay length would be c * tau_0 * beta. But with time dilation, it's gamma * beta * c * tau_0, which is what we calculated earlier.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the decay length without considering time dilation, but that seems unlikely because the proper lifetime is given.

But let me compute that. Proper lifetime is tau_0 =8e-16 s.

x = c * tau_0 * beta.

So c =3e8 m/s.

beta ≈ 0.992.

So x = 3e8 * 8e-16 * 0.992.

3e8 *8e-16 = 2.4e-7.

Multiply by 0.992 → ~2.38e-7 m, which is 2.38e-7 m. That's about 0.238 micrometers, which is 2.38e-7 = 2.38*1e-7 m. None of the options match this either.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck. Let me look back at the options.

Options:

A) 2.08e-6 m (2.08 micrometers)
B) 2.08e-9 m (2.08 nanometers)
C) 2.08e-1 m (20.8 cm)
D) 2.08e-3 m (2.08 mm)

Given that the decay length we calculated was approximately 1.887e-6 m (about 1.89 micrometers), and the delta was about 2.27e-6 m.

But the option A is 2.08e-6 m, which is about 2.08 micrometers. Close to what we got for delta (2.27e-6 m). Hmm, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the minimum distance needed, which is the mean decay length. So in that case, the mean decay length is 1.887e-6 m. So the detector's resolution must be at least this to see some of the decays. But wait, no, the mean is the average, so 30% is less than that.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the minimum resolution such that the average decay length is 30% of the resolution. Wait, that doesn't make much sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimum resolution is the distance that the particle travels during its proper lifetime. Because, in its own frame, the particle's lifetime is tau_0, so it can't move much. But in the lab frame, it's moving at high speed.

Wait, in the lab frame, the lifetime is gamma * tau_0, so the distance it can travel is gamma * beta * c * tau_0. Which we calculated as L =1.887e-6 m.

So the minimum resolution needed is the L, because particles will decay at various distances, and the detector needs to be able to resolve that.

Wait, but the question says 'minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays'. So perhaps the minimum would be when the detector can just resolve 30% of the decays, meaning that 30% of the decay lengths are larger than the resolution.

So, as before, delta is the distance where 30% decay beyond it. So delta = L * ln(1/0.7) → 1.887e-6 m * 0.35667 → ~6.73e-7 m.

But none of the options match this. Alternatively, maybe the question is considering the minimum possible distance that 30% decay beyond, which would be a small number, but the options don't seem to have that.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the formula again.

The required resolution is delta, the minimum distance such that 30% of the decays are beyond it. So delta is such that P(x>delta) = 0.3.

We have P(x>delta) = e^(-delta/L) = 0.3 → delta = L * ln(1/0.3) ≈ L * 1.20397.

So delta ≈ 1.20397 * 1.887e-6 m ≈ 2.27e-6 m.

But none of the options match this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation.

Wait, let me recheck the calculation of gamma and beta.

Gamma = E/m = 27 /3.41.

Compute 3.41 *7 =23.87, 3.41 *7.9 = 27.259. Oh wait, 3.41 *7.9 =27.259, which is larger than 27.

So 7.9 *3.41 = 27.259. So 27 is less than that. So gamma is 7.9 * (27/27.259) → wait, no, 27/3.41 is 7.9178.

Wait, perhaps the calculation is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is not considering beta as sqrt(1-1/gamma^2), but using another approach. For example, if the energy is given, then beta can be calculated from the energy.

Wait, E = gamma m c², and p = gamma beta m c.

But another way, beta = p c / E.

But without knowing the momentum, perhaps it's better to proceed as before.

Wait, perhaps the problem is expecting me to not consider time dilation, but just calculate the speed based on energy.

Wait, wait, the energy is given as 27 GeV, and the mass is 3.41 GeV/c².

So, energy E = gamma m c² → gamma = E/(m c²). But in natural units, c=1, so E = gamma m.

Thus, gamma = E/m = 27 /3.41 ≈7.9178.

The velocity beta is (v/c) = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)).

So as before, beta ≈ 0.992.

So the previous calculation was correct.

Hmm, but according to that, the delta is ~2.27e-6 m, but the options don't have this. The closest option is A) 2.08e-6 m.

Wait, perhaps I should recompute 27 /3.41 exactly.

27 ÷ 3.41.

Let me do this division precisely.

3.41 ×7 =23.87.

27 -23.87 =3.13.

3.41 ×0.9 =3.069.

3.13 -3.069 =0.061.

So 0.061 ÷3.41 =0.0179.

So gamma is 7.9 + 0.0179 =7.9179.

So, that's correct.

Hmm, maybe the problem expects using beta as v = (pc²)/E, where E is the total energy.

Wait, E² = (pc c)^2 + (m c²)^2.

So, p = sqrt(E² - m² c^4) / c.

So, beta = (p c²)/E.

Wait, perhaps that's another approach.

Let me compute beta using this formula.

E =27 GeV.

m c² =3.41 GeV.

So, E² = (27)^2 =729 (GeV)^2.

m^2 c^4 = (3.41)^2 ≈11.6281 (GeV)^2.

So, p² c^4 = E² - m^2 c^4 = 729 -11.6281 =717.3719.

p c = sqrt(717.3719) ≈26.786 GeV.

So, beta = (p c)/E =26.786 /27 ≈0.99207.

So beta is approximately 0.99207.

So that's consistent with the previous calculation.

So, same numbers as before.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is using a different approach. Maybe they're asking for the minimum distance such that the particle's lifetime is the proper lifetime. So, without considering time dilation, the particle can only travel c*tau_0.

But that's way too small: c * tau_0 =3e8 m/s *8e-16 s =24e-8 m=2.4e-7 m. Which is 0.24 micrometers. So the detector resolution would need to be at least 0.24 micrometers to see any decay. But in reality, time dilation allows the decay to happen much further away, making the decay length much longer.

So, perhaps that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the minimum resolution to observe that the decay happened, meaning that the decay length must be larger than the detector's resolution. So, the minimum resolution is the decay length, but considering that you need to see at least 30% of the decays. So, the detector must have a resolution such that 30% of the decays are beyond delta.

So, as before, delta = L * ln(1/(1 -0.3)) = L * ln(1/0.7) ≈ L * 0.35667.

L is 1.887e-6 m, so delta is 0.35667 *1.887e-6 ≈6.73e-7 m.

But none of the options match.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the minimum resolution being the mean decay length multiplied by 30%?

Mean decay length is L=1.887e-6 m. 30% of that is 0.566e-6 m, which is about 0.566 micrometers. Still not matching any options.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is expecting to use the velocity as a fraction of c, but I think I have done that.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of L. Let me recompute L.

L = gamma * beta * c * tau_0.

gamma is approx 7.9178.

beta is approx 0.99207.

c is 3e8 m/s.

tau_0 is8e-16 s.

So, 7.9178 *0.99207 =7.864.

7.864 *3e8 =2.3592e9.

2.3592e9 *8e-16 = (2.3592 *8) *1e-7.

2.3592 *8 =18.8736.

So, 18.8736e-7 m =1.88736e-6 m.

So L=1.88736e-6 m.

Hmm, that's the mean decay length. So, if the detector's resolution is equal to the mean decay length, then on average, 50% of the particles decay beyond that distance. But the question asks for 30%.

So, delta is less than the mean. So, delta is 30% of the particles decay beyond it. So, that would be a shorter distance than the mean.

Wait, but earlier calculation for delta to have 30% beyond is about 6.73e-7 m.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the minimum resolution is the length where 30% of the decays are contained within that distance. That would be a smaller distance, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the length that corresponds to 30% of the particles decaying within that length. So, P(x < delta) =0.3.

Which is 1 - e^(-delta/L) =0.3 → e^(-delta/L)=0.7 → delta= L * ln(1/0.7) ≈ L *0.35667 → 1.887e-6 *0.35667≈ 6.73e-7 m.

But again, that's not an option.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing a step. Let me think again about the formula.

The decay length is L = gamma * beta * c * tau_0.

We have that correct.

The probability that the decay occurs after a distance x is P(x) = e^(-x/L).

So, to have 30% of the decays beyond x, P(x) =0.3.

So, 0.3= e^(-x/L) → x= -L ln(0.3) ≈ L *1.20397.

So x=1.20397 *1.887e-6 m= 2.27e-6 m.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps the correct answer is not in the options, but given the options, the closest is option A: 2.08e-6 m.

Alternatively, perhaps the calculation of L is wrong.

Wait, another approach. Let me compute L in meters.

gamma =7.9178.

beta=0.99207.

c=3e8 m/s.

tau_0=8e-16 s.

So, L=gamma * beta * c * tau_0.

=7.9178 *0.99207 *3e8 *8e-16.

Compute step by step:

7.9178 *0.99207 ≈7.864.

7.864 *3e8 =2.3592e9.

2.3592e9 *8e-16=1.88736e-6 m.

So L=1.88736e-6 m.

So, the mean decay length is 1.887e-6 m.

But the question is about the minimum resolution to observe at least 30% of the decays.

So, what's 30% of the particles in terms of the decay length.

The fraction of decays beyond a certain length x is given by:

P(x) = e^(-x/L).

We want P(x) =0.3 → x = L * ln(1/0.3) ≈1.204 * L.

So x=1.204 *1.887e-6 ≈2.27e-6 m.

But none of the options match this.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the minimum resolution to be the mean decay length. But that would be option not present either.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the minimum distance a particle must travel to have a 30% chance of decaying, which is 30% of the mean decay length.

Mean decay length is ~1.887e-6 m. 30% is 0.566e-6 m, but that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the minimum resolution as the decay length without considering time dilation, but that's not correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach. Let me think about the proper formula.

The proper decay time is tau_0. But in the lab frame, the lifetime is tau=gamma tau_0.

The average distance the particle travels before decaying is L= gamma beta c tau_0.

The probability that the decay occurs after a certain distance x is P= e^(-x/L).

So, to detect 30% of the decays, we need the probability that the decay occurs beyond x to be 30% (0.3).

Thus, 0.3 = e^(-x/L) → x = L * ln(1/0.3) ≈ L *1.20397.

So, x=1.887e-6 *1.20397 ≈2.27e-6 m.

But the options don't have this value. The closest is option A:2.08e-6 m.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute L more accurately.

Wait, let me compute gamma and beta with more precision.

Gamma =27 /3.41 → let me compute this division precisely.

3.41 ×7 =23.87.

27-23.87=3.13.

3.13 /3.41 =0.9178.

So gamma =7.9178.

Beta:

beta = sqrt(1 - (1/(gamma^2))).

gamma^2= (7.9178)^2 =62.685.

So 1/gamma² =0.015953.

1-0.015953=0.984047.

sqrt(0.984047)=0.9920.

So beta=0.9920.

Then, L=gamma * beta * c * tau_0.

gamma=7.9178, beta=0.9920.

gamma * beta=7.9178 *0.9920=7.864.

c=3e8 m/s.

tau_0=8e-16 s.

So L=7.864 *3e8 *8e-16.

Compute 7.864 *3e8 =2.3592e9.

Multiply by 8e-16: 2.3592e9 *8e-16=18.8736e-7 m =1.88736e-6 m.

So, L=1.88736e-6 m.

Then, delta=1.20397 *1.88736e-6= 2.27e-6 m.

But the options only have 2.08e-6, which is about 2.08 micrometers.

Hmm, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the formula. Let me think.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the minimum resolution is the minimum distance the particle can travel before decaying, which is the decay length in the absence of time dilation. But that would be c * tau_0 * beta.

c=3e8 m/s.

tau_0=8e-16 s.

beta=0.992.

So, L0 =3e8 *8e-16 *0.992=2.376e-7 m.

But that's way smaller than any of the options. So that can't be the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking about the decay length without considering time dilation, but that would be much smaller.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the question is about the time it takes for the decay, and the resolution is the minimum time resolution needed to observe the decay. But the problem states it's about the minimum resolution in the Bubble Chamber, which I think refers to spatial resolution.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck. Given the calculations, the correct answer should be approximately 2.27e-6 m. Since none of the options match, perhaps the intended answer is option A:2.08e-6 m.

Alternatively, perhaps I should re-examine the calculation of gamma and beta.

Wait, let me compute gamma again more accurately.

gamma =27 GeV /3.41 GeV=27/3.41=7.9178.

Yes.

Beta= sqrt(1-1/(gamma^2)).

gamma squared is 7.9178^2 = (7 +0.9178)^2 =7^2 +2*7*0.9178 +0.9178^2.

7^2=49.

2*7*0.9178=14*0.9178≈12.85.

0.9178^2≈0.842.

So total gamma^2≈49 +12.85 +0.842=62.692.

So 1/gamma^2=1/62.692≈0.01595.

So 1 -0.01595=0.98405.

sqrt(0.98405)=0.9920.

So beta=0.9920.

Hmm, same as before.

So the calculations seem correct.

Given that, I think the correct answer is approximately 2.27e-6 m, but since it's not an option, perhaps the problem expects the answer to be option A:2.08e-6 m.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a miscalculation in the expression for delta. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the minimum resolution to have 30% of the decays within the resolution. That would be P(x < delta)=0.3.

Which would imply delta = L * ln(1/(1-0.3))= L * ln(1/0.7)= L *0.3567.

So, delta=1.887e-6 *0.3567 ≈6.73e-7 m.

But again, this isn't an option.

Wait, looking back, I see that option B is 2.08e-9 m, which is 2 nanometers. That's much smaller than the mean decay length, so it's unlikely.

Option D is 2.08e-3 m, which is about 2 mm. That's much larger than the mean decay length, so perhaps it's the maximum resolution needed, but the question is about the minimum.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is expecting to compute using the velocity as v = (E^2 - m^2 c^4)^(1/2) / E.

Wait, let me compute beta using this formula.

Beta = (sqrt(E^2 - m^2 c^4)) / (E c).

Wait, in terms of units, perhaps I should just compute beta as (p c)/E.

Earlier, we found that p c = sqrt(717.3719) GeV ≈26.786 GeV.

So beta = (26.786 GeV) / (27 GeV) ≈0.99207.

Which is the same as before.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the velocity as v = c * sqrt(1 - (m^2 c^4)/(E^2)).

Which is the same as beta = sqrt(1 - (m^2 c^4)/(E^2)).

So beta = sqrt(1 - (3.41^2)/(27^2)).

Compute 3.41^2=11.6281.

27^2=729.

So 11.6281/729 ≈0.01595.

So beta = sqrt(1-0.01595)=sqrt(0.98405)=0.9920.

Again, same as before.

Hmm.

I think I've exhausted all the approaches. Given the options, the closest option to the calculated delta is option A:2.08e-6 m. But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects using tau_0 without considering gamma and beta.

Let me compute that.

If we don't consider time dilation, the decay length is c * tau_0 * beta.

So, c=3e8 m/s.

tau_0=8e-16 s.

beta=0.992.

So, L0=3e8 *8e-16 *0.992=2.376e-7 m.

Which is 0.2376 micrometers, but that's not an option either.

Another possibility: perhaps the problem is asking for the minimum resolution in terms of the proper lifetime, but that doesn't make much sense.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the mean lifetime in the lab frame and then compute the distance.

Wait, the lab frame lifetime is tau = gamma tau_0 =7.9178 *8e-16 s=6.334e-15 s.

The mean distance is L = c * tau =3e8 m/s *6.334e-15 s=1.900e-6 m.

Ah, wait, that's approximately 1.9e-6 m, which is close to option A:2.08e-6 m.

Wait, so if I compute L as c * tau, which is 3e8 m/s *6.334e-15 s=1.9002e-6 m.

So L≈1.9e-6 m.

But the options have option A as 2.08e-6 m.

Hmm, perhaps the calculation was approximated as 2.08e-6 m, which is close to 1.9e-6.

But why would that be the case? Because in that case, L would be the mean decay length, and perhaps the problem expects the minimum resolution to be the mean decay length.

But earlier, we found that the mean decay length is L=gamma * beta * c tau_0.

Wait, which is the same as c * gamma * tau_0 * beta.

Which is c * tau * beta.

Wait, no, because tau = gamma tau_0.

So L = c * tau * beta.

Which is gamma * beta * c tau_0.

Which is the same as before.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the minimum resolution to observe any decay, which would require the resolution to be less than the decay length. But that would require the resolution to be less than the mean decay length.

But the question specifically says 'at least 30%' so it's about 30% of the decays.

Hmm.

Given that, perhaps the intended answer is option A:2.08e-6 m.

As my earlier calculation for delta came to approximately 2.27e-6 m, which isn't an option, but option A is the closest, I think the intended answer is A.


To solve the problem, we analyze the decay process of the particle \( X^0 \) in the CERN Bubble Chamber. The proper lifetime of \( X^0 \) is given as \( \tau_0 = 8 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{s} \), and the energy of the particle in the lab frame is \( E = 27 \, \text{GeV} \), while its mass is \( m = 3.41 \, \text{GeV}/c^2 \). The goal is to determine the minimum resolution required to observe at least 30% of the decays.

### Key Steps in the Analysis:

1. **Relativistic Time Dilation**:  
   The lifetime of \( X^0 \) in the lab frame is dilated due to special relativity:
   \[
   \tau = \gamma \tau_0,
   \]
   where \( \gamma = \frac{E}{m c^2} \). In natural units (\( c = 1 \)), \( \gamma = \frac{E}{m} = \frac{27}{3.41} \approx 7.9178 \).

2. **Decay Length**:  
   The average decay length in the lab frame is:
   \[
   L = \gamma \beta c \tau_0,
   \]
   where \( \beta = v/c \). Using the relation \( \beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}} \), we calculate:
   \[
   \beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{7.9178^2}} \approx \sqrt{1 - 0.01595} \approx 0.9920.
   \]
   Substituting \( \gamma = 7.9178 \), \( \beta = 0.9920 \), \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), and \( \tau_0 = 8 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{s} \), we find:
   \[
   L = 7.9178 \cdot 0.9920 \cdot 3 \times 10^8 \cdot 8 \times 10^{-16} \approx 1.887 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m}.
   \]

3. **Probability of Decay Beyond a Distance**:  
   The probability that a particle decays beyond a distance \( x \) is given by:
   \[
   P(x) = e^{-x / L}.
   \]
   To observe at least 30% of the decays, we need \( P(x) = 0.3 \). Solving for \( x \):
   \[
   0.3 = e^{-x / L} \implies x = -L \ln(0.3).
   \]
   Using \( \ln(0.3) \approx -1.20397 \), we find:
   \[
   x = L \cdot 1.20397 \approx 1.887 \times 10^{-6} \cdot 1.20397 \approx 2.27 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m}.
   \]

4. **Comparison with Options**:  
   The calculated minimum resolution \( x \approx 2.27 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m} \) (2.27 micrometers) is closest to option **A** (\( 2.08 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m} \)). While there is a slight discrepancy, this is the most reasonable choice among the given options.

### Conclusion:
The minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays is approximately \( 2.08 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m} \).

**Answer: A**
