Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about Grubbs catalyst and racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Hmm, let me think about what I know. Grubbs catalyst is used for olefin metathesis, right? That's where it helps in breaking and reforming carbon-carbon double bonds.

The compound given is racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Wait, racemic means it's a 50-50 mix of enantiomers. So, the molecule has a stereocenter, and both forms are present. But wait, actually, 3-methylpent-1-ene would have a structure like CH₂=CH-C(CH3)H-CH₂CH3? No, wait. Let me draw the structure.

3-methylpent-1-ene would be CH₂=CH-C(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, wait. Wait, pent-1-ene is CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH3. So, 3-methyl would add a methyl group on the third carbon. So, structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3? That can't be right because pent-1-ene is five carbons in total. Let me count: 1, 2, 3, 4,5. So, the double bond is between C1 and C2. The third carbon (C3) has a methyl group attached. So structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3? Wait, that would make it a five-carbon chain. Let me check: 1 (CH2), 2 (CH-), 3 (CH(CH3)), 4 (CH2), 5 (CH3). No, wait, that's six carbons. Hmm, I must be getting confused.

Wait, maybe it's 3-methylpent-1-ene, which is CH₂=CH-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2CH3? No, that's not right either. Wait, maybe the structure is CH₂=CHCH(CH3)CH2CH3. But wait, that's 3-methylpent-1-ene? Let me think. The pent-1-ene is CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH3. Now, adding a methyl group on carbon 3 would mean the third carbon from the double bond. So, perhaps it's CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3. That makes sense because carbon 3 is the middle one.
