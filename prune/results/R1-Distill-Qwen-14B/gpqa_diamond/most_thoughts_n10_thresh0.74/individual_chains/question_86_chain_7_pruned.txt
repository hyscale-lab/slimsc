Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again carefully.

The question says that a chemist performed two reactions using two different reducing agents. The products are both (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one respectively. Wait, no, waitâ€”the first reaction starts with compound A and uses LiBH4 and H+. The product is (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. The second reaction uses compound B and BH3 followed by H+, and the product is (S) of the same compound.

I need to select the correct starting materials A and B from the given options. The options are A, B, C, D which each have different configurations for the same compound: 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.

Hmm, so the main thing here is about the stereochemistry. The reactions involve reducing agents, which probably are involved in some kind of reduction, maybe ketone to alcohol, but wait, let me think. Wait, pyran-2-one is a cyclic ketone. So, maybe the starting materials are epoxides, or perhaps something else that would form a cyclic hemiacetal or something upon reduction.

Wait, LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent. It can reduce carbonyl groups. BH3 is typically used for hydroboration reactions. Oh wait, but in the case of BH3 followed by H+, it's probably BH3 acting as a borane reagent in a hydroboration reaction.

Wait, but the products are tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one derivatives. So that's a six-membered ring with an oxygen, like a cyclic ether with a ketone. So the structure is similar to tetrahydropyran, but with a ketone at position 2. So, perhaps the starting material is an ester or something similar that can form the ring upon reaction.

Wait, the starting materials are 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. Let me draw that structure. Pentanoic acid has five carbons. The substituents are at positions 3 and 5. So, position 5 has isobutoxy and oxo groups. Wait, so 5-oxopentanoic acid would
