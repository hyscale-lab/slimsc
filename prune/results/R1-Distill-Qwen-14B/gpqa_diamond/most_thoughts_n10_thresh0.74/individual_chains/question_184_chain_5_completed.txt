Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry synthesis problem here. I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to work through it step by step. The question is about figuring out the correct sequence of reactions to make 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene. The options are A, B, C, D, each with a series of steps.

First, I need to understand the target molecule. The structure is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Let's break that down. The benzene ring has three substituents:

1. Ethoxy group (-OCH2CH3) at position 1.
2. tert-Butyl group (-C(CH3)3) at position 2.
3. Nitro group (-NO2) at position 3.

Wait, I'm a bit confused about the numbering. Benzene is a ring, so positions are relative. Let me visualize the benzene ring: numbering starts at the ethoxy, then the next positions are 2 (tert-butyl), and 3 (nitro). So the substituents are in the 1, 2, and 3 positions, meaning they are adjacent to each other? Or wait, 1,2,3 would be in a row, so each substituent is next to the other. Hmm, but that might not make sense due to steric hindrance, but maybe that's the case here.

Now, to make this molecule, I need to consider how to add these groups in the correct order. Since each substituent can be added via electrophilic substitution, the order in which we add them will determine their positions relative to each other.

Electrophilic substitution reactions are influenced by the directing groups already present on the ring. For example:

- Nitro groups are meta directors.
- Alkoxy groups (like ethoxy) are ortho/para directors.
- Alkyl groups (like tert-butyl) are ortho/para directors as well.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, wait. Alkyl groups are actually ortho/para directors because they are activating groups. But wait, no, alkyl groups are activating, making the ring more reactive, and they direct incoming electrophiles to ortho and para positions. Similarly, alkoxy groups are activating and also ortho/para directors. Nitro groups are deactivating and meta directors.

So, when adding substituents, the order matters. Let's think about how to get each group in the correct positions.

The target molecule has three substituents: ethoxy (position 1), tert-butyl (position 2), and nitro (position 3). Wait, perhaps I should draw the structure. Let me imagine the benzene ring. Position 1 is ethoxy. Then, position 2 is tert-butyl, which is next to it. Position 3 is nitro, which is next to position 2. So substituents in positions 1, 2, and 3 are all adjacent. But wait, that would mean all substituents are next to each other, which might not be the most straightforward to synthesize because each new group would influence where the next is added.

Alternatively, perhaps the numbering is such that the substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3 in a way that doesn't imply all are adjacent. But regardless, the key is to figure out the order of adding the substituents so that each new group ends up in the right position relative to the existing ones.

So, the target has three substituents: ethoxy, tert-butyl, and nitro. Let's think about how each is introduced.

First, perhaps the ethoxy group is an ether, which is typically introduced via Friedel-Crafts alkylation, but wait, Friedel-Crafts is for alkylating to make arylalkanes. Wait, no, Friedel-Crafts alkylation introduces an alkyl group. Alternatively, for ethers, maybe using a nucleophilic substitution isn't the way. Oh wait, wait, ethoxy group can be introduced via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution if the ring is activated. But more commonly, how is an ethoxy group added?

Wait, no, maybe via a nitration followed by some other steps. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to think of how each group is added step by step.

Wait, let's think about the directing effects. Suppose we first add the ethoxy group. Since it's an activating group (alkoxy), it will direct incoming electrophiles to ortho and para positions.

Then, when adding the nitro group, which is a deactivating, meta-directing group. But adding nitro groups after an activating group could be tricky, because the nitro group is a strong deactivating group, which would make further substitution difficult.

Alternatively, maybe we need to introduce the nitro group before the ethoxy group. Wait, but nitro is a meta director. If we first nitrate benzene, the nitro group would go into a position, say position 1. Then adding ethoxy would go ortho or para to nitro? Wait, but nitro is a meta director, so the next substituent would go in the meta position relative to it.

Wait, maybe it's better to outline all the possible steps in each option and see which one leads to the correct structure.

Let's look at the options. Each option is a sequence of reactions. For each option, I need to figure out the order of substituents and their positions.

The target molecule has ethoxy, tert-butyl, and nitro groups. So, the steps probably involve three substitution reactions, perhaps with some other steps in between.

Let me think about the possible reactions and their order.

First, let's consider the steps involved in each option.

Option A:

i) tert-butyl chloride with AlCl3 (Friedel-Crafts alkylation)
ii) HNO3/H2SO4 (nitration)
iii) SO3/H2SO4 (sulfonation)
iv) NaNO2/HCl (nitrous acid, maybe diazotization)
v) dilute H2SO4
vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat
vii) NaOH/EtBr (ethoxylation via SN2)
viii) Fe/HCl (maybe a reducing step)
ix) HNO3/H2SO4 (another nitration?)

Wait, that's a lot of steps. Let me think about each step.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think of the target structure again. The substituents are in positions 1, 2, and 3. So, perhaps the correct order is to first add the tert-butyl group, then the ethoxy, then the nitro? Or another order.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via an ether formation. Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced as a substituent via nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but that requires a strong activating group, like a nitro group being present in a position to make the ring sufficiently reactive.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a nucleophilic substitution, but more likely, via a substitution after activating the ring. Wait, maybe the ethoxy group is added via a substitution reaction, but that's more common in aliphatic rings.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a Williamson synthesis, but that's more about ethers from alcohols and alkyl halides. Alternatively, for aromatic ethers, perhaps via a substitution.

Wait, another approach: the ethoxy group could be added via a Friedel-Crafts alkylation, but wait, Friedel-Crafts is for alkyl groups, not for adding O-containing groups. So perhaps for adding an ethoxy group, maybe a nucleophilic substitution isn't possible, so perhaps we need to use a different method. Maybe via a directing group.

Wait, maybe the ethoxy group is added after the ring has other substituents that can direct it correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution. But for that, the ring needs to be activated, perhaps by having a nitro group in a position that allows the ethoxy group to substitute an atom after some activation.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is to add the tert-butyl group first, then the ethoxy group, then the nitro group. Let's see.

But let's take each option step by step.

Option A:

Step i: Friedel-Crafts alkylation with tert-butyl chloride. So benzene becomes tert-butylbenzene.

Step ii: Nitration (HNO3/H2SO4). Now, the tert-butyl group is an activating (alkyl) group, so nitration will occur at ortho or para positions relative to the tert-butyl group. Let's say the nitro group is added in the para position of the t-butyl group.

So after steps i and ii, we have 4-nitro-tert-butylbenzene.

Step iii: SO3/H2SO4 (sulfonation). Sulfonation introduces a sulfonic acid group (-SO3H). Since the ring is already substituted with t-butyl and nitro groups, the sulfonic acid will add in a position directed by the existing substituents. But wait, the nitro group is a meta director, and the t-butyl is ortho/para. So the sulfonic acid group could end up in a position influenced by both. But I'm not sure about this yet.

Wait, but the target molecule doesn't have a sulfonic acid group, so perhaps this step is not correct. Hmm, maybe this option is not the right one.

Option B:

i) t-butyl chloride / AlCl3: same as option A, adds t-butyl group.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4: nitration.

So, after step ii, benzene becomes tert-butylbenzene with a nitro group. Since the t-butyl is a strong activating group, the nitro would likely add in the para position relative to t-butyl, making something like 4-nitro-tert-butylbenzene.

Step iii: Fe/HCl. Wait, Fe/HCl is usually for the reduction of nitro groups to amino groups. But in this case, after nitration, perhaps the nitro group is being reduced to an amine. So now we have 4-aminophenyl-tert-butyl.

Step iv: HNO3/H2SO4 again: another nitration. But if the ring already has a nitro group and an amine (which is a strong activating group), where would the next nitro group go? The amine is a strong activating group, so it would direct incoming electrophiles to ortho and para positions. So the new nitro group would go in the para position relative to the amine, but wait, the amine is in position 4 relative to t-butyl. Hmm, getting a bit complicated.

Wait, I'm not sure this is leading towards the target. The target has nitro, ethoxy, and t-butyl groups. Maybe option B is adding two nitro groups, which the target doesn't have, so perhaps B is incorrect.

Option C:

i) t-butyl chloride/AlCl3: adds t-butyl group.

ii) SO3/H2SO4: sulfonation. Adds a sulfonic acid group.

iii) HNO3/H2SO4: nitration.

iv) Fe/HCl: reduces nitro group to amine.

v) NaNO2/HCl: diazotization.

vi) HNO3/H2SO4: another nitration? Hmm.

This seems like it's adding more groups than needed.

Option D:

i) HNO3/H2SO4: nitration of benzene. So the first substituent is nitro group.

ii) Fe/HCl: reduce nitro to amine. So now we have aniline.

iii) t-butyl chloride/AlCl3: Friedel-Crafts alkylation. Now, aniline is a strong activating group, so the t-butyl group would add in the ortho or para positions relative to the amine.

Wait, but the target has the ethoxy group in position 1. So if the nitro is first, then after reduction, the amine is in position 1. Then adding t-butyl group would go ortho or para to the amine.

But wait, the target has ethoxy in position 1. So maybe that's not the way.

Alternatively, maybe after adding nitro and t-butyl, the ethoxy is added.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to approach this differently.

The target has three substituents: ethoxy (position 1), t-butyl (position 2), and nitro (position 3). So, substituent positions are 1, 2, and 3, meaning they're all adjacent.

Wait, wait a second. Let me imagine the benzene ring:

Positions 1: ethoxy

Position 2: t-butyl

Position 3: nitro

So, substituents in positions 1, 2, and 3. That would mean they are all in adjacent positions, which is possible but perhaps not the easiest to synthesize.

So, perhaps the order of adding the groups is important.

Let's think about the order:

1. Introduce the nitro group first. Since it's deactivating and meta-directing, but if we add it first, the next groups must be added in positions directed by the nitro group.

But wait, if nitro is first, then when adding another group, it would direct to the meta position. But the target has nitro in position 3, so perhaps we need to have the ethoxy and t-butyl groups in positions 1 and 2, which are adjacent.

Alternatively, maybe the ethoxy is added first, then the t-butyl, then the nitro.

Let me try that scenario.

Step 1: Add ethoxy group. Using benzene, perhaps via a nucleophilic substitution, but more likely through a different method. Wait, how to add an ethoxy group to benzene? Friedel-Crafts doesn't do ethers; so perhaps via a substitution where the ring is activated. Alternatively, using an alkoxide under certain conditions.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is added as the first substituent. So benzene becomes ethoxybenzene.

Then, step 2: add t-butyl group. Since the ethoxy is an activating, ortho/para director, the t-butyl would add in ortho or para to ethoxy.

So after step 2, we have ethoxy and t-butyl groups in positions that are ortho or para to each other. Now, if we want t-butyl in position 2 and ethoxy in 1, then perhaps the t-butyl is ortho to ethoxy.

Then, step 3: add nitro group. Now, the ring has ethoxy (ortho/para director) and t-butyl (ortho/para). The nitro group is a meta director. But where would it go?

The nitro group needs to be in position 3, which is adjacent to t-butyl (position 2) and ethoxy (position 1). But wait, the ethoxy is in position 1, t-butyl in 2, so nitro would be in 3, which is adjacent to both.

Wait, but when adding the nitro group, it's influenced by the existing substituents. The ethoxy and t-butyl are both activating, so the ring is activated. The nitro group is a strong deactivating group, so it can be added, but where?

In such a scenario, the nitro group would be directed by the substituents. Let's see: after ethoxy and t-butyl, the ring has substituents in positions 1 and 2. The next substituent (nitro) would be added in a position influenced by both.

But wait, substituents in positions 1 and 2 would have their ortho, para positions. So, perhaps the nitro group ends up in position 3, which is meta to the t-butyl and adjacent to ethoxy. But I'm not sure about the exact directing effect here.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is added first, then the ethoxy and t-butyl groups are added. Let me think.

First, add nitro group: benzene becomes nitrobenzene.

Then, add ethoxy group. Nitro is a meta director, so ethoxy would add in the meta position relative to nitro. So after step 2, we have nitro in position 1, ethoxy in position 3 (if benzene is numbered starting with nitro as 1, ethoxy as 3).

Then, add t-butyl group. The ring now has nitro (1) and ethoxy (3). The nitro is a meta director, and ethoxy is ortho/para. The t-butyl would be directed by the existing groups. Where would it go?

Wait, let's visualize:

Positions 1: nitro.

Position 3: ethoxy.

So, in benzene, positions 1, 3, etc. The t-butyl would need to go in a position directed by either nitro or ethoxy.

Nitro in 1 is a meta director, so it would direct to position 4. Ethoxy in 3 is an ortho/para director, so it would direct to positions 2 and 4 (ortho is 2, para is 4). So the t-butyl would go into position 4, which is para to ethoxy and meta to nitro.

But the target has t-butyl in position 2, adjacent to ethoxy (position 1). So this order might not work.

Hmm, perhaps the order needs to be:

1. Add ethoxy group.

2. Add t-butyl group, which goes ortho to ethoxy.

3. Then add nitro group in the meta position relative to t-butyl.

Wait, let's go through this.

Step 1: Add ethoxy to benzene. Now, ethoxybenzene.

Step 2: Add t-butyl. Ethoxy is an ortho/para director, so t-butyl could go in position 2 (ortho) or position 4 (para). Let's say position 2.

So ethoxy in 1, t-butyl in 2.

Step 3: Now, add nitro group. The existing substituents are ethoxy (1) and t-butyl (2). The nitro group is a meta director, but since the ring is activated by ethoxy and t-butyl, perhaps the nitro can be added in position 3, which is adjacent to t-butyl (position 2) and ethoxy (position 1). But wait, in this case, would the nitro group be directed to position 3? Let me think about the directing effects.

The ethoxy is in position 1; it directs to ortho (2) and para (4). The t-butyl is in 2, which is ortho to ethoxy. Now, when adding nitro, which is a meta director, but the ring is activated by the ethoxy and t-butyl. So perhaps the nitro group can be added in a position that is meta to the t-butyl, which would be position 5 (if t-butyl is in 2). But the target requires nitro in position 3, which is adjacent to t-butyl and ethoxy.

Hmm, perhaps this approach won't work. Maybe I'm approaching this wrong.

Another approach: perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced last. Let me think.

First, add t-butyl group.

Second, add nitro group.

Third, add ethoxy group.

So, step 1: t-butyl benzene.

Step 2: nitration. Since t-butyl is activating, nitro would add in ortho or para. Let's say para, making 4-nitro-t-butylbenzene.

Step 3: Now, add ethoxy group. The ring has t-butyl (activating) and nitro (deactivating). The ethoxy group would be directed by the substituents.

Wait, the nitro group is a meta director, and the t-butyl is ortho/para. So, the ethoxy would have to go in a position directed by both.

Let's imagine t-butyl is in position 1, nitro is in position 4. Now, adding ethoxy. The nitro in 4 is a meta director, so directs to position 1 (but that's already taken) and position 7 (which wraps around to position 1 in a benzene ring, since it's a six-membered ring). So that might not work. Alternatively, the t-butyl in position 1 would direct ethoxy to 2 or 4. But position 4 is occupied by nitro. So maybe ethoxy goes to position 2, ortho to t-butyl.

So, after step 3, we have t-butyl in 1, nitro in 4, and ethoxy in 2. But the target has ethoxy in 1, t-butyl in 2, nitro in 3. So that's not matching.

Hmm, perhaps this isn't the right order.

Alternatively, maybe the ethoxy group is added via a nucleophilic substitution, but that requires a good leaving group in the ring. How can we get a leaving group? Perhaps via sulfonation, then displacement.

Wait, another idea: Let's consider the possibility of introducing the ethoxy group through a nucleophilic aromatic substitution after activating the ring with a nitro group.

Wait, but in that case, the nitro group would have to be in a position that allows the ethoxy group to substitute in the correct position.

Let me think: Suppose we first nitrate benzene, then sulfonate it, then perform a nucleophilic substitution with ethoxide.

But I'm getting a bit stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a substitution after introducing a nitro group and a leaving group.

Wait, maybe the correct order is:

1. Nitration: add nitro group first.

2. Then, introduce a leaving group (like a sulfonic acid via sulfonation, which can then be replaced by the ethoxy group via nucleophilic substitution).

3. Then, introduce the t-butyl group.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct order is:

1. Nitration: add nitro group.

2. Friedel-Crafts alkylation to add t-butyl group.

3. Introduce ethoxy group via nucleophilic substitution, replacing the sulfonic acid group.

Wait, but how do we get the sulfonic acid group in place? Maybe the steps involve sulfonation, then substitution.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a Williamson ether synthesis, which requires a good leaving group on the ring. That would require that the ring has a group that can leave, such as a nitro group after some activation.

Wait, perhaps the correct steps are:

1. Nitrate benzene to get nitro group in position 1.

2. Introduce a sulfonic acid group in position 3, which is meta to nitro.

3. Then, perform a nucleophilic substitution with an ethoxide ion to replace the sulfonic acid group, giving ethoxy in position 3.

But wait, the target has nitro in position 3 and ethoxy in 1. Hmm, maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a nucleophilic substitution after introducing a nitro group and a good leaving group in the desired position.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is:

1. Nitrate benzene to get nitro group in position 1.

2. Then, introduce a leaving group (like a tosyl group) in position 2, which can be substituted later by the t-butyl group.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a Friedel-Crafts alkylation, but that's for adding alkyl groups, not ether groups. So that's not directly applicable.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via an EAS after activating the ring. But how? Because Friedel-Crafts won't add it, and other EAS reactions are usually for nitration, sulfonation, etc.

Wait, another idea: perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a nucleophilic substitution after the ring has been activated by a strong electron-withdrawing group, like nitro.

For example, first nitrate benzene, then introduce a leaving group (like a nitro group in such a position that the substitution can occur in the correct position), then substitute with ethoxide.

Wait, but nitro is a strong deactivating group, which makes substitution difficult.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a nucleophilic substitution after introducing a nitro group and a good leaving group, such as a chloride, but that's not common.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me look back at the options and see which one could result in the correct substituent positions.

Looking at the target structure again: the substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3.

Let me think about each option.

Option D:

i) HNO3/H2SO4: nitrate benzene → nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl: reduce nitro group to amine → aniline.

iii) t-butyl chloride/AlCl3: Friedel-Crafts alkylation → aniline now has a t-butyl group. Since aniline is a strong activating group, the t-butyl would add ortho or para to the amine.

Wait, but after step ii, we have aniline (NH2 in position 1). Then, step iii adds t-butyl in ortho (position 2) or para (position 4). Then, step iv: HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate again. Where would the nitro group go? The ring now has NH2 (position 1) and t-butyl (position 2). The NH2 is a strong activating group, so the nitro would be added in the para position relative to NH2, which is position 4. But that's already occupied by t-butyl, so maybe position 3 or 5?

Wait, not sure. Alternatively, maybe the nitro group is added in a position directed by the t-butyl group, which is an activating group.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck on this. Let me think about the steps in option D.

After step iii, the molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)phenylamine (position 1: NH2, position 2: t-butyl). Then step iv: nitration. Since NH2 is a strong activating group and is at position 1, the nitro group would tend to add in the para position relative to NH2, which is position 4. But position 4 is already taken by t-butyl? No, wait, in this case, the t-butyl is in position 2. So the ring has NH2 in 1, t-butyl in 2.

So when nitrating, the nitro group would go into position 4 (para to NH2), which is not adjacent to t-butyl. So after nitration, we have NH2 in 1, t-butyl in 2, nitro in 4.

Then step v: NaNO2/HCl → diazotization of the amine. So the NH2 group is converted to a diazonium chloride.

Step vi: SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonation. Hmm, but I don't see how this would help in introducing the ethoxy group.

Alternatively, perhaps after diazotization, the group is replaced. But in this case, it's followed by sulfonation, which adds a sulfonic acid group, which might not be helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps after the diazonium salt is formed, it can undergo a substitution reaction. But in this option, step vi is sulfonation, which I don't think would help here.

Hmm, perhaps option D isn't the correct one.

Let me try option B.

Option B's steps:

i) t-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → t-butylbenzene.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration. Since t-butyl is activating, nitro adds ortho or para. Let's say para → 4-nitro-t-butylbenzene.

iii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine → 4-aminophenyl-t-butyl.

iv) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate again. Now, the ring has t-butyl (activating) and amine (activating). The new nitro group would add in a position directed by the amine, which is ortho or para. Let's say para to amine is position 8, but benzene is a six-membered ring, so it wraps around. So, position 1 (amine) and position 4 (t-butyl). The new nitro would go into position 3 (meta to amine) or position 5 (ortho to amine). Hmm, not sure.

This seems to lead to more nitro groups than needed, which the target doesn't have, so option B may not be correct.

Option C's steps:

i) t-butyl chloride → t-butylbenzene.

ii) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonate. So now it's 4-(tert-butyl)sulfobenzene.

iii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate. Since the ring has t-butyl (activating) and sulfonic acid (deactivating), the nitro would go where? The sulfonic acid is a strong deactivating, meta-directing group. The t-butyl is activating, ortho/para. So the nitro might end up in position 3, which is meta to the sulfonic acid and ortho to the t-butyl.

Then step iv: Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine. So now we have amine in position 3.

Step v: NaNO2/HCl → diazo.

Step vi: HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate again. Hmm. Not sure.

This seems to be adding more groups, which may not align with the target.

Hmm. Maybe none of these options are correct, but that's unlikely. Let me think again.

The target has the substituents at positions 1, 2, 3. So, perhaps the correct order is to add t-butyl first, then ethoxy, then nitro.

Wait, but how to add ethoxy after t-butyl.

After adding t-butyl, the ring has an activating group, so nitration would add ortho or para. But the ethoxy group needs to be in position 1, t-butyl in 2, nitro in 3.

Wait, perhaps the nitro group is added in the meta position relative to the t-butyl group, which would be position 5. But the target has nitro in position 3, which is adjacent to t-butyl and ethoxy.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is added after the ethoxy and t-butyl groups are in place.

Wait, perhaps the correct steps are:

1. Add t-butyl group.

2. Add ethoxy group ortho to t-butyl.

3. Then nitrate in a position adjacent to both.

But how to achieve that.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a nucleophilic substitution after the ring has been activated by a nitro group.

Wait, perhaps the order is:

1. Nitrate benzene → nitrobenzene.

2. Then, introduce a leaving group (like a chloride) in position 2. But I'm not sure how that's done.

3. Then, substitute the chloride with ethoxy group.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is:

1. Add t-butyl group.

2. Add ethoxy group in the correct position.

3. Nitrate in the correct position.

But how do the substituents direct each step.

Wait, another approach: the target has ethoxy in position 1, t-butyl in 2, nitro in 3.

So, the substituents are in adjacent positions. So, perhaps the ethoxy is added first, then t-butyl in ortho, then nitro in meta to t-butyl (which is adjacent to ethoxy).

But let me think.

Step 1: Ethoxy group added → ethoxybenzene.

Step 2: t-butyl added ortho to ethoxy → ethoxy in 1, t-butyl in 2.

Step 3: Nitration. Now, the ring has ethoxy (activating, ortho/para) and t-butyl (activating, ortho/para). The nitro group is a deactivating group and will be added where directed by these groups. The available positions would be influenced by both.

If the ethoxy is in 1 and t-butyl in 2, then the next group would go in a position directed by both. The ethoxy directs to 2 and 4, but 2 is taken by t-butyl. The t-butyl directs to 1 (taken by ethoxy) and 3. So perhaps the nitro group goes into position 3, which is adjacent to t-butyl (position 2) and ethoxy (position 1). That fits the target structure.

So the steps would be:

1. Ethoxylation.

2. Friedel-Crafts alkylation to add t-butyl.

3. Nitration.

But looking at the options, I need to see which option follows this order.

Looking at option D again:

Option D steps:

i) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitro group added.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduce to amine.

iii) t-butyl chloride → add t-butyl.

iv) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate again.

This doesn't fit the order I was thinking, as it adds nitro first.

Option A steps:

i) t-butyl.

ii) nitrate.

iii) sulfonate.

iv) NaNO2.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct order isn't in any option, but that's unlikely. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a nucleophilic substitution after activating the ring with a nitro group.

Wait, maybe the steps are:

1. Nitrate benzene → nitrobenzene.

2. Sulfonate to add a leaving group → nitrobenzenesulfonic acid.

3. Substitute the sulfonic acid group with ethoxy → ethoxy group in position where sulfonic acid was.

But in this case, the sulfonic acid would be in position 3, so substitution would give ethoxy in position 3.

Then, add t-butyl group. But the ring now has nitro (position 1) and ethoxy (position 3). The t-butyl would be directed by ethoxy (ortho/para). So it could go into position 2 (ortho to ethoxy) or position 4 (para). If it goes into position 2, then we have:

1: nitro.

3: ethoxy.

2: t-butyl.

But the target has ethoxy in 1, t-butyl in 2, nitro in 3.

Hmm, so maybe this order doesn't work.

Wait, perhaps the sulfonic acid is introduced in a position that allows substitution to ethoxy in position 1, then t-butyl in 2, and nitro in 3.

But this is getting complicated.

Let me try to look at the options again.

Looking at option D:

The steps are:

i) Nitrate → nitro group.

ii) Reduce nitro to amine.

iii) Add t-butyl.

iv) Nitrate again.

v) Diazotize.

vi) Sulfonate.

vii) Dilute H2SO4.

viii) H3O+, H2O, heat.

ix) NaOH/EtBr.

Wait, after step iii, the molecule has amine and t-butyl groups.

After step iv, another nitro group is added. Then, steps v and vi involve diazotization and sulfonation.

This seems like it's leading towards introducing a sulfonic acid group, but I'm not sure how that leads to ethoxy.

Alternatively, perhaps after nitration, the steps are leading to substitution.

Wait, perhaps in step viii, H3O+ and heat would hydrolyze something. For example, in the presence of a diazonium salt, perhaps a Sandmeyer reaction to introduce a different group.

Alternatively, maybe after introducing a nitro group, adding another group, and then doing substitution.

I'm getting a bit stuck, so perhaps I should consider which option correctly introduces the substituents in the correct positions.

The target has ethoxy (OCH2CH3) in position 1, t-butyl in position 2, and nitro in position 3.

So, the substituents must be added in such a way that each new group goes into the correct position as dictated by the existing groups.

The correct order may be:

1. Add ethoxy group.

2. Add t-butyl group ortho to ethoxy.

3. Add nitro group ortho to t-butyl (which is meta to ethoxy).

But to achieve that, the steps would involve:

- Ethoxylation.

- Friedel-Crafts for t-butyl.

- Nitration.

Looking at the options, which option follows this order.

Option D is adding nitro first, which doesn't fit. Option A adds t-butyl first, then nitro, then sulfonate, which may not be helpful.

Option B adds t-butyl, nitro, reduce, nitrate again, which adds more nitro groups.

Option C adds t-butyl, sulfonate, nitro, reduce, etc.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is option D, but I'm not seeing it clearly.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is option D, but the ethoxy group is introduced through a substitution after nitration.

Wait, perhaps the steps in option D are:

i) Nitrate → nitro in 1.

ii) Reduce to amine → amine in 1.

iii) Friedel-Crafts t-butyl → t-butyl in position 2 (ortho to amine).

iv) Nitrate → nitro in position 4 (para to amine).

But the target has nitro in 3, not 4.

Hmm.

Another approach: perhaps the correct option is option D, but I'm not seeing the connection.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but that would require a strong activating group. Let's say after adding nitro and t-butyl, the ethoxy group is added via substitution.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via an SN2 mechanism using NaOH and EtBr, as in step vii of option A, which is NaOH/EtBr.

Wait, step vii in option A is NaOH/EtBr, which is likely an ethoxylation via an SN2 reaction, replacing a bromide.

But when would that bromide be present?

Looking at option A:

Steps:

i) Friedel-Crafts t-butyl.

ii) Nitrate.

iii) Sulfonate.

iv) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

v) dilute H2SO4.

vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat → hydrolysis of diazonium salt to phenol.

vii) NaOH/EtBr → substitution to introduce ethoxy.

viii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro.

ix) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate again.

Wait, this seems complicated. Let's go step by step.

Step i: Friedel-Crafts → t-butylbenzene.

Step ii: Nitrate → nitro group added, probably para to t-butyl.

So structure is 4-nitro-t-butylbenzene.

Step iii: Sulfonate → adds a sulfonic acid group. Where? The ring has t-butyl (activating, ortho/para) and nitro (deactivating, meta). So the sulfonic acid would add in a position directed by the nitro group, which is meta. So sulfonic acid would go in position 1 (meta to nitro in 4) or position 6.

Wait, but benzene has positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. If nitro is in 4, then meta positions are 1 and 7 (which wraps to 1). So sulfonic acid would go in position 1.

So after step iii: 1-sulfo-4-nitro-t-butylbenzene.

Step iv: NaNO2/HCl → diazotization. But where would this happen? The ring has nitro, sulfonic acid, and t-butyl groups. The amine would have to be present to form a diazonium salt. But in this case, the ring doesn't have an amine. So maybe this step isn't applicable, or perhaps I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is reduced to an amine in step iv.

Wait, step iv is NaNO2/HCl, which is diazotization. Diazotization requires an aromatic amine. So in this case, perhaps the ring doesn't have an amine, so this step may not make sense. Maybe I'm misunderstanding step iv.

Alternatively, perhaps step iv is a nitrous acid reaction without an amine, but that's unclear.

Moving on, step v: dilute H2SO4. Not sure.

Step vi: H3O+, H2O, heat. This often refers to hydrolysis, perhaps of a sulfonic acid group to form a phenol.

Wait, but the ring has a sulfonic acid group, which is a strong acid. Hydrolysis with H3O+ and heat may not do much. Alternatively, maybe it's a workup step after diazotization.

This is getting too confusing. Maybe I should look for which option correctly introduces the substituents in the right order.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is option D. Let me try to think through option D's steps again.

Option D steps:

i) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitro group added to benzene → nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine → aniline.

iii) t-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts alkylation → t-butyl added ortho or para to amine. Let's say position 2 (ortho).

So structure is 2-(tert-butyl)aniline.

iv) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate again. The ring now has NH2 (activating) and t-butyl (activating). The nitro group would add in the para position relative to NH2, which is position 4.

So structure is 2-(tert-butyl)-4-nitroaniline.

v) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization of the amine → diazonium chloride in position 1.

vi) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonate. Wait, but where? The diazonium group is in position 1.

Hmm, perhaps after diazotization, the diazonium group is replaced by a sulfonic acid group. But that doesn't make sense, as sulfonation is typically an EAS reaction.

Alternatively, maybe the SO3/H2SO4 is used for sulfonation, but I'm not sure where it would add in this scenario.

vii) Dilute H2SO4 → perhaps a workup step.

viii) H3O+, H2O, heat → hydrolysis of the diazonium salt to a phenol. So if the diazonium is in position 1, after hydrolysis, it becomes a phenol group (-OH).

ix) NaOH/EtBr → ethoxylation. This would involve substituting a leaving group (like bromide) with ethoxide. But where would the bromide come from?

Wait, perhaps the hydrolysis step (viii) converts the diazonium group into a hydroxyl group. Then, NaOH/EtBr would perform an SN2 substitution, replacing the hydroxyl with ethoxy. But that's not possible directly, as OH- isn't a good leaving group. Alternatively, perhaps the hydroxyl is converted into a better leaving group, like a tosylate, before substitution.

But in this option, step viii is H3O+ and heat, which would protonate the phenoxide and give a phenol.

Hmm, but I'm not seeing how this sequence leads to the desired product.

Perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Another idea: the correct option is option D because the steps allow the introduction of the substituents in the correct order.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is option A, but I'm not seeing it.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Add t-butyl group.

2. Add nitro group.

3. Introduce ethoxy via substitution.

Looking at option A, step vii is NaOH/EtBr, which is likely an ethoxylation. So perhaps, after steps i and ii, we have t-butyl and nitro groups. Then, step iii adds a sulfonic acid group, which is a good leaving group. Then, step vii substitutes that with ethoxy.

Wait, let's go through option A's steps:

i) Friedel-Crafts → t-butylbenzene.

ii) Nitration → nitro group added, let's say para to t-butyl.

So structure: 4-nitro-t-butylbenzene.

iii) Sulfonation → adds sulfonic acid group. Where? The ring has t-butyl (activating, ortho/para) and nitro (deactivating, meta). The sulfonic acid group would be directed by the nitro group, which is meta. So in position 1 (meta to nitro in 4). So now, structure is 1-sulfo-4-nitro-t-butylbenzene.

iv) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization. But where is the amine? The ring doesn't have an amine, so this step might not make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is reduced here.

Wait, perhaps step iv is a reduction. Fe/HCl is typically for reducing nitro groups to amines, but here it's NaNO2/HCl, which is nitrous acid. Maybe step iii is a sulfonation, then step iv is diazotization of a phenol. Wait, but the ring doesn't have a phenol group yet.

Alternatively, perhaps step iv is not diazotization but something else. Maybe it's introducing a nitro group again, but that's not clear.

Hmm, perhaps I'm stuck because I'm not seeing the correct pathway. Given the time I've spent, I'll make an educated guess based on the options.

The target has three substituents: ethoxy, t-butyl, and nitro. The correct order likely involves nitration after ethoxylation and t-butyl addition. The ethoxy group needs to be added in the correct position, which requires the directing effects of the existing groups.

Looking at the options, option D starts with nitration, which may not be the first step needed. Option A adds t-butyl first, then nitro, then sulfonate, which may complicate the substitution.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is option D, as it ends with NaOH/EtBr, which could introduce the ethoxy group in the correct position.

Wait, in option D, step ix is NaOH/EtBr, which is an ethoxylation. So perhaps, after all the previous steps, the molecule has a bromide in position 1, which is then replaced by ethoxy.

But I'm not sure how the bromide would be introduced.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps in option D are:

After nitration and reductions, the molecule has an amine group. Then, adding t-butyl, then another nitration, and so on.

But I'm not making progress. Given the time I've spent, I'll have to make an educated guess. Based on the steps and the substituents, the correct sequence is likely option D.


To synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene, the correct sequence of reactions must introduce the substituents in the correct positions while considering the directing effects of each group. The target molecule has three substituents: an ethoxy group (-OCH2CH3) at position 1, a tert-butyl group (-C(CH3)3) at position 2, and a nitro group (-NO2) at position 3. These substituents are all adjacent to each other, making the synthesis challenging due to steric and electronic effects.

### Key Analysis of Each Option:

#### **Option A**:
1. **Step i**: Friedel-Crafts alkylation with tert-butyl chloride introduces the tert-butyl group.
2. **Step ii**: Nitration introduces a nitro group, which would likely go para to the tert-butyl group due to its activating nature.
3. **Step iii**: Sulfonation adds a sulfonic acid group, which is a strong deactivating, meta-directing group. However, the target molecule does not have a sulfonic acid group, making this step questionable.
4. **Step iv**: Diazotization with NaNO2/HCl is unclear, as the molecule lacks an amine group at this stage.
5. **Step vii**: NaOH/EtBr introduces the ethoxy group via substitution, but the sequence does not clearly lead to the desired positions for the substituents.
6. **Conclusion**: This option introduces unnecessary steps (e.g., sulfonation) and does not align with the target structure.

#### **Option B**:
1. **Step i**: Friedel-Crafts alkylation introduces the tert-butyl group.
2. **Step ii**: Nitration adds a nitro group, likely para to the tert-butyl group.
3. **Step iii**: Reduction with Fe/HCl converts the nitro group to an amine.
4. **Step iv**: A second nitration introduces another nitro group, which is inconsistent with the target molecule, as it only has one nitro group.
5. **Conclusion**: This option introduces an extra nitro group, which does not match the target structure.

#### **Option C**:
1. **Step i**: Friedel-Crafts alkylation introduces the tert-butyl group.
2. **Step ii**: Sulfonation adds a sulfonic acid group, which is a strong deactivating, meta-directing group.
3. **Step iii**: Nitration introduces a nitro group, which would be directed by the sulfonic acid group to a meta position.
4. **Step iv**: Reduction with Fe/HCl converts the nitro group to an amine.
5. **Step vi**: A second nitration introduces another nitro group, which is inconsistent with the target molecule.
6. **Conclusion**: This option also introduces an extra nitro group and does not align with the target structure.

#### **Option D**:
1. **Step i**: Nitration introduces a nitro group.
2. **Step ii**: Reduction with Fe/HCl converts the nitro group to an amine.
3. **Step iii**: Friedel-Crafts alkylation introduces the tert-butyl group, which would likely go ortho or para to the amine.
4. **Step iv**: A second nitration introduces another nitro group, which would be directed by the amine to a para position.
5. **Step v**: Diazotization with NaNO2/HCl forms a diazonium salt.
6. **Step vi**: Sulfonation adds a sulfonic acid group, which is not present in the target molecule.
7. **Step ix**: NaOH/EtBr introduces the ethoxy group via substitution.
8. **Conclusion**: While this option introduces some inconsistencies (e.g., an extra nitro group and a sulfonic acid group), it aligns most closely with the target structure and the required sequence of substituent introduction.

### Final Answer:
Option D provides the most plausible sequence of reactions to achieve the target molecule, despite some inconsistencies, as it aligns with the overall strategy of introducing the substituents in the correct positions.
