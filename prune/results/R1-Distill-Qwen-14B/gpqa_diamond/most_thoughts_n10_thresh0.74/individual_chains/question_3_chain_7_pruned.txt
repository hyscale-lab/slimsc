Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm going to try to solve it step by step. Let's see what it's about. 

The question is about a spin-half particle in a specific linear superposition state. The state is given as 0.5|↑⟩ plus sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. So, that's a combination of the spin-up and spin-down states. I remember that spin states are eigenstates of certain Pauli matrices. Oh right, |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz, the Pauli z matrix. 

The question asks for the expectation value of the operator 10σz +5σx. Hmm. I think expectation values involve taking the inner product of the state with the operator acting on the state, but let me recall the exact process.

First, the expectation value ⟨O⟩ for an operator O in a state |ψ⟩ is ⟨ψ| O |ψ⟩. So I'll need to compute that for O = 10σz +5σx.

But wait, the operator is a sum of two terms, so maybe I can compute each expectation separately and then add them. Because expectation is linear, right. So ⟨10σz +5σx⟩ = 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩.

So, the plan is to compute ⟨σz⟩ and ⟨σx⟩ separately, then multiply by their coefficients and add.

Let me write down the state ψ again: ψ = 0.5 |↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2) |↓⟩. So, the coefficients are 0.5 and sqrt(3)/2. Let me check the normalization. (0.5)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = 0.25 + 3/4 = 1. So that's fine, it's a normalized state.

Now, σz is the Pauli z matrix, whose eigenvalues are +1 for |↑⟩ and -1 for |↓⟩. So when calculating ⟨σz⟩, it's the expectation value of σz in this state.

Since |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz, the expectation value is just the sum of the probabilities multiplied by their respective eigenvalues.

So, the probability of |↑⟩ is |0.5|^2 = 0.25. The eigenvalue for σz here is +1. Similarly, the probability of |↓⟩ is |sqrt(3)/2|^2 = 3/4, and the eigenvalue is -1.

So ⟨σz⟩ = 0.25 * (+1) + 0.75 * (-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5.

Wait, that calculation: 0.25 *1 is 0.25, 0.75 * (-1) is -0.75. Adding them gives 0.25 -0.75= -0.5. So that's correct.

Now, moving on to σx. Oh wait, σx is the Pauli x matrix, and its eigenstates are not |↑⟩ and |↓⟩, I think. So I can't directly use their probabilities as with σz. I'll need to compute ⟨σx⟩ using the state ψ.

Alternatively, I remember that for spin-½ particles, the expectation value of σx can be calculated using the components of the state. Let me think: the state ψ can be written as a column vector. So, in the standard basis where |↑⟩ is (1,0) and |↓⟩ is (0,1), ψ is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]^T.

The expectation value of σx is given by ψ† σx ψ. So I can calculate that.

The Pauli x matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So, let me compute ψ† σx ψ.

First, write ψ as a row vector
