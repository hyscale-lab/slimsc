Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The first part is about 1,3-dibromoadamantane being heated with excess KOH, creating a light yellow solid product 1. Then, product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. After that, ozone is bubbled through a solution of product 2 at -78Â°C, followed by adding dimethylsulfide, giving product 3. The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3's 1H NMR spectrum.

Hmm, let me break this down. I think I'll tackle each step one by one.

First reaction: 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH. KOH is a strong base, so dibromide reacting with a base probably leads to an elimination reaction, forming an alkene. Since it's 1,3-dibromo, heating with KOH (maybe via an E2 mechanism) would form an allene or possibly a cyclopropane? Wait, no, more likely an elimination. Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane has two bromines on adjacent carbons? No, wait, adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so the 1 and 3 positions are on different bridged carbons. So when you eliminate two Brs, you probably form an allene because the two Brs are on adjacent carbons, so eliminating would give a double bond between them. Wait, but with two Brs, maybe it's a Dieckmann elimination or something else. Alternatively, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation to form an alkene.

Wait, but wait. 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have two Br atoms on adjacent bridgehead carbons? Wait, adamantane has a structure where each bridgehead carbon is connected to three other carbons. So 1 and 3 positions would be on adjacent bridgeheads. So when you eliminate two HBr molecules, you get a double bond between those bridgeheads.

Wait, but in adamantane, the bridgeheads are all equivalent in a way, so when you eliminate two Brs, you form a double bond, creating an allene structure? Or perhaps a norbornene-like structure. Wait, norbornene is bicyclic. Alternatively, perhaps forming a bridge
