Okay, so I've got this problem here about space travel and time dilation. Hmm, let me think about what I know. So, there's this spacecraft traveling at a very high speed, 0.99999987 times the speed of light. The astronaut is 22 years old, and I need to find out how long it takes from their perspective to reach Earth. 

Wait, the question says the astronaut's average lifetime is about 150 solar years. So if the trip takes more than that from their perspective, they wouldn't survive. But I need to calculate the time experienced by the astronaut, which is the proper time, I think. Because when you're moving at such high speeds, time dilation occurs, so the time experienced on the ship is less than what an outside observer would see.

So, Earth is the destination, but I don't know the distance. Oh wait, the Large Magellanic Cloud is the starting point. I think the distance between the LMC and Earth is about 160,000 to 170,000 light-years. Let me remember that. So, let's say approximately 163,000 light-years. Because I remember that the LMC is around that distance from the Milky Way.

The speed is 0.99999987c, which is super close to the speed of light. So the time from Earth's frame would be distance divided by speed. Let's compute that. So, 163,000 light-years divided by 0.99999987c. Since the speed is in terms of c, the years will come out as time in years. So that's roughly 163,000 / 0.99999987 ≈ 163,000 * (1/1-0.99999987) ? Wait, no, wait. Wait, 0.99999987 is very close to 1. So 1/0.99999987 is about 1.00000013. So the time from Earth's frame is about 163,000 * 1.00000013 ≈ 163,000.021 ≈ approximately 163,0
