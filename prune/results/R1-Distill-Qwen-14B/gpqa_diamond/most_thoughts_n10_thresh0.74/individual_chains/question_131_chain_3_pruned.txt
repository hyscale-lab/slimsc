Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this chemistry problem. Let me read it carefully and break it down step by step.

The question is about a reaction involving an anhydride and a diene, leading to two products. Then, the NMR data of the major product is analyzed, particularly looking at the NOESY spectrum. The goal is to determine which two resonances are connected by the cross-peak in the major product's spectrum.

Alright, let's start from the beginning. The initial compound is a dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene. When dehydrated, it forms an anhydride. The anhydride has specific NMR characteristics: a single peak at 7 ppm in 1H NMR and two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm in 13C NMR. So, what does that tell me?

In 1H NMR, a peak at 7 ppm is probably from an aromatic proton, but wait, no, wait. Alternatively, it could be from an alkene's proton if it's deshielded. Wait, but the 13C NMR has 137 and 165 ppm. Let me think: 137 ppm is typical for a carbon adjacent to an oxygen, maybe an ester or an anhydride's carbonyl group. The 165 ppm is probably a carbonyl carbon, like a ketone or an ester or anhydride. So, the anhydride structure would have two carbonyl groups. But wait, the 1H NMR has a single peak at 7 ppm. Hmm. Maybe the anhydride is cyclic, like a cyclic anhydride, perhaps a five-membered ring, because they tend to be more stable. In a cyclic anhydride, there might be two equivalent oxygenated carbons. So, maybe a structure like succinic anhydride, but that's a five-membered ring. The protons adjacent to the carbonyl would be in a certain environment.

Wait, but the 1H NMR shows a single peak at 7 ppm. That suggests that all the protons that are equivalent are showing up as a single peak. In succinic anhydride, there are two sets of protons, but perhaps in this case, the structure is such that all the protons are equivalent. Alternatively, maybe the anhydride is symmetric, so the protons are all the same. Alternatively, maybe the anhydride doesn't have any protons adjacent to the carbonyl, but that's unlikely because succinic anhydride, for example, has two sets of two equivalent protons each.

Wait, maybe the anhydride is maleic anhydride. Wait, no, because maleic anhydride is a five-membered ring with two double bonds. Its structure has two double bonds, so the protons adjacent to the carbonyl would be at higher ppm than 7. Or maybe I'm confusing with something else. Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclic anhydride with a conjugated double bond, and the protons are in a position that gives a singlet. Hmm.

Wait, another angle. The anhydride is formed from a cis-dicarboxy
