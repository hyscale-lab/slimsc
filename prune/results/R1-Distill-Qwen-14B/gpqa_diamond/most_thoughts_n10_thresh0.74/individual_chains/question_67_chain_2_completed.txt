Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

Alright, the problem says we have two electrons in p orbital angular momentum states. I remember that the p orbitals have a quantum number l=1. So each electron has l1 and l2, both equal to 1. The coupled angular momentum state is given as |l1, l2, l, m> = |1, 1, 2, -1>. Hmm, so here l is the total orbital angular momentum quantum number. Wait, adding two l=1's together, the possible total l values are 0, 1, 2. So l can be 2 in this case.

The question is about measuring the orbital angular momentum components L1z and L2z for each electron. They're asking for the joint probability that both measurements give -ħ. So what's L1z and L2z for each electron?

I think L1z is the z-component of the orbital angular momentum for particle 1, which would have eigenvalues m1 * ħ, where m1 can be -1, 0, +1 for l=1. Similarly for L2z, it's m2 * ħ, and m2 can be -1, 0, +1.

The state given is |1,1,2,-1>. I think this is a state where the total orbital angular momentum l is 2, and the z-component m is -1. So the total Lz is mħ = -ħ.

But each electron's individual Lz could vary as long as their sum is -ħ. Because the total m is m1 + m2 = -1. So m1 + m2 = -1.

Wait, but the problem says to ignore spin angular momentum. So we're only dealing with the orbital angular momentum here.

So the state |l1, l2, l, m> is a coupled state, meaning it's an eigenstate of the total angular momentum operators L² and Lz. So when we're measuring L1z and L2z, we need to find the possible values of m1 and m2 that sum up to m = -1.

But wait, the given state is |1,1,2, -1>, which is the coupled state. To find the individual m1 and m2, we might need to express this coupled state in terms of the product states of the individual angular momenta. Because the product states are the eigenstates of L1z and L2z.

The product states would be |m1, m2>. But the coupled state is a combination of these product states.

So the question reduces to: what is the expansion of |1,1,2,-1> in terms of the |m1, m2> basis? Because only the coefficients will tell us the probabilities.

Hmm. I remember that when you couple two angular momenta, the states can be expressed as linear combinations of the product states. For two p orbitals (l=1 each), the total l can be 0,1,2.

For the specific case of l=2, m=-1, what are the possible m1 and m2 values that can contribute to this state?

Well, m = m1 + m2. We need m1 + m2 = -1.

Possible m1 and m2 pairs:
- m1=0, m2=-1 → sum -1.
- m1=1, m2=-2 → but m2 can't be -2 because l=1. So invalid.
- m1=-1, m2=0 → sum -1.
- m1=-2, m2=1 → again, m1 can't be -2, so invalid.

Wait, so the only possible pairs are m1=0 and m2=-1, or m1=-1 and m2=0.

So the coupled state |1,1,2,-1> must be a linear combination of |m1=0, m2=-1> and |m1=-1, m2=0>.

But wait, how does that work? Let me think about the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. The Clebsch-Gordan coefficients describe how the coupled states are built from the product states.

The state |l1=1, l2=1, l=2, m=-1> can be written as a combination of product states where m1 + m2 = -1. So it's a combination of |1, m1> ⊗ |1, m2> with m1 + m2 = -1.

But what are the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for this particular case?

I might need to recall or derive the coefficients. Alternatively, perhaps there's a simpler way.

Alternatively, perhaps the state |1,1,2,-1> can be written as a sum of |m1, m2> terms where m1 + m2 = -1.

The possible pairs are (m1, m2) = (0, -1) and (-1, 0). So,

|1,1,2,-1> = a |0, -1> + b |-1, 0>

But what are a and b?

I think the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for this specific case (l=1 and l=1 combining to l=2) can be found. Let me try to remember.

Wait, I think for L=2, m=2: it's just |1,1> → coefficient 1. For m=1, it's a combination of |1,0> and |0,1>, etc.

But for m=-1, which is the case we have, the state would be a combination of |0, -1> and |-1, 0>.

I think the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for l=2, m=-1 are such that the coefficients for |0, -1> and |-1, 0> are both 1/√2.

Wait, no, maybe not. Let me think again. The Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for two l=1's combining to l=2... how so?

Another approach: The number of possible ways to get m_total = m1 + m2.

For m=2: only m1=1, m2=1 → coefficient 1.

For m=1: m1=1, m2=0 and m1=0, m2=1. The coefficients would be 1/sqrt(2) each, because for l=2, m=1, the state is (|1,0> + |0,1>)/sqrt(2). No, wait, no. Wait, when you combine two angular momenta, the coefficients are determined by the Clebsch-Gordan series. For example, the state |2,1> is (|1,1> |0,0> + ... ? No, perhaps not. Hmm, perhaps I should think in terms of ladder operators.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to look up the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for l=1 and l=1 coupling to l=2.

I remember that for two l=1 states, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for the state |l=2, m=-1> would be a combination of |m1=0, m2=-1> and |m1=-1, m2=0>.

The coefficients for these terms can be found. I think the coefficient for |0, -1> is 1/sqrt(2), and same for |-1, 0>. So the state is (|0,-1> + |-1,0>)/sqrt(2).

Wait, is that correct? Let me think about the normalization. The square of the coefficients should add up to 1.

So if each term has coefficient 1/sqrt(2), then |1/sqrt(2)|² + |1/sqrt(2)|² = 1/2 + 1/2 = 1. That seems correct.

So, the state |1,1,2,-1> is (|0,-1> + |-1,0>)/sqrt(2).

So the expansion is |1,1,2,-1> = 1/sqrt(2) |0,-1> + 1/sqrt(2) |-1,0>.

Now, the problem is asking for the joint probability of measuring L1z and L2z to be -ħ each. So we need both m1 and m2 to be -1.

Wait, let's see. If we have a product state |m1, m2>, then L1z |m1, m2> = m1 ħ |m1, m2> and similarly for L2z.

So for each electron, m1 and m2 are their respective m values.

The question is, in the state |1,1,2,-1>, which is a combination of |0, -1> and |-1, 0>, what's the amplitude for the state where both m1 and m2 are -1?

Looking at the expansion, in the state |1,1,2,-1>, the product states are |0, -1> (m1=0, m2=-1) and |-1, 0> (m1=-1, m2=0). There's no term where both m1 and m2 are -1, because that would require m_total = -2, but our state is m_total = -1.

So in the expansion of |1,1,2,-1>, the coefficients for product states where m1 = m2 = -1 are zero. Because in the expansion, the only product states are |0,-1> and |-1,0>.

So the probability of m1 = -1 and m2 = -1 is zero.

Wait, that's because when m1 = -1 and m2 = -1, their sum is -2, which doesn't match the m=-1 of the state. So in the expansion, those terms don't appear.

Therefore, the probability of both electrons having m=-1 (so L1z = -ħ and L2z = -ħ) is zero. So the joint probability is zero.

So the correct answer would be D) 0.


The problem involves two electrons in a coupled angular momentum state $|l_1, l_2, l, m> = |1, 1, 2, -1>$. Here, $l_1 = 1$ and $l_2 = 1$ are the orbital angular momentum quantum numbers of the two electrons, while $l = 2$ and $m = -1$ represent the total angular momentum quantum number and its $z$-component, respectively. The task is to determine the joint probability of measuring $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ (the $z$-components of the orbital angular momentum of the two electrons) as $-\hbar$ for both electrons.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Coupled State Expansion**:  
   The coupled state $|1, 1, 2, -1>$ can be expressed as a linear combination of product states $|m_1, m_2>$, where $m_1$ and $m_2$ are the $z$-components of the orbital angular momentum for the two electrons. Since $m = m_1 + m_2 = -1$, the possible pairs $(m_1, m_2)$ that satisfy this condition are:
   - $(m_1, m_2) = (0, -1)$
   - $(m_1, m_2) = (-1, 0)$

   Thus, the coupled state can be written as:
   \[
   |1, 1, 2, -1> = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} |0, -1> + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} |-1, 0>
   \]

2. **Probability of Measuring $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$**:  
   The problem asks for the joint probability of measuring $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$. For this to occur, the total $m$ would need to be $m_1 + m_2 = -2$. However, the given state $|1, 1, 2, -1>$ corresponds to $m = -1$, not $m = -2$. Therefore, there is no contribution from the product state $|-1, -1>$ in the expansion of $|1, 1, 2, -1>$.

3. **Conclusion**:  
   Since the product state $|-1, -1>$ does not appear in the expansion of $|1, 1, 2, -1>$, the probability of measuring $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$ is **zero**.

### Final Answer:
The joint probability of measuring $L_{1z} = -\hbar$ and $L_{2z} = -\hbar$ is:
