Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, I remember that the RV method measures the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravitational pull. The shift tells us about the planet's mass and orbit.

The question says there are two stars with the same mass as our Sun. Each has a planet with mass similar to Neptune. Both planets have circular orbits. The key data is the periodic shifts in the spectral lines: Planet 1 causes a 5 milliangstrom shift, and Planet 2 causes a 7 milliangstrom shift. We need to find how many times longer Planet 2's orbital period is compared to Planet 1's.

Wait, I think the RV method measures the star's velocity towards and away from us. The formula for the velocity semi-amplitude (K) is related to the planet's mass and the orbital period. Oh right, the formula is K = (v) = (G * (M_p) / (M_* + M_p))^(1/3) * (1/(2π)) * (1/(sqrt(a^3/(M_*^2)) )) )? Or wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of the Doppler shift relation.

Alternatively, I recall that the RV semi-amplitude K is given by the formula:

K = (2π G) / (c T) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / (M_* + M_p)^(2/3)

But since M_p is much smaller than M_*, we can approximate M_* + M_p ≈ M_*. So the formula simplifies.

Wait, perhaps a better way is to think about the relation between the RV semi-amplitude and the orbital period. The RV method gives us the velocity semi-amplitude, K, which is related to the star's orbit around the barycenter. The formula for K is:

K = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) ]^(1/3) * (1 / (2π T)) ) * (1/c)

But since e is zero for circular orbits, and M_p << M_*, so M_* + M_p ≈ M_*. So:

K ≈ ( (G M_p ) / (M_* T) )^(1/3) * (1/(2π c)) ) * (1/(1)) )

Wait maybe I should approach this using the fact that the RV semi-amplitude K is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital period. Because the formula for K involves T in the denominator, and when considering the same star mass and same planet mass, the ratio of K would relate to the inverse square root of the orbital periods.

Wait, wait. Let me think. The formula for K (velocity semi-amplitude) is:

K = ( (27 * π) / (2 c) )^(1/3) * ( (M_p) / (M_*)^(1/3) ) ) * ( (1) / ( (1 + M_p/M_*) )^(1/3) ) ) * (1 / sqrt(T)) )

Wait, perhaps another approach is better. The Doppler shift is proportional to the star's velocity. The star's velocity in its orbit (due
