Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about a spin-half particle in a specific superposition. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The problem states that the particle is in the state 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. Wait, let me check the normalization. The coefficients are 0.5 and sqrt(3)/2. Let me square them and add. 0.5 squared is 0.25. sqrt(3) is about 1.732, so sqrt(3)/2 is about 0.866, and its square is about 0.75. 0.25 + 0.75 equals 1, so the state is normalized. That's good.

The question is asking for the expectation value of the operator 10σz +5σx. Hmm. I remember that the expectation value of an operator is ⟨ψ|O|ψ⟩ where O is the operator and ψ is the state.

Since the operator is a sum of σz and σx terms, maybe I can split the expectation value into two parts: 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩.

Let me first find ⟨σz⟩. Since |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz, with eigenvalues +1 and -1 respectively. So σz |↑⟩ = +1 |↑⟩ and σz |↓⟩ = -1 |↓⟩.

The state is ψ = a|↑⟩ + b|↓⟩ where a=0.5 and b= sqrt(3)/2. So the expectation value ⟨σz⟩ is |a|²*(+1) + |b|²*(-1). Let me compute that.

|a|² is (0.5)^2 = 0.25. |b|² is (sqrt(3)/2)^2 which is 3/4=0.75.

So ⟨σz⟩ = 0.25*(1) + 0.75*(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5. So the expectation of σz is -0.5.

Then, for the 10σz term, the expectation would be 10*(-0.5) = -5.

Now, what about ⟨σx⟩? Oh, σx is the Pauli X matrix, which is the spin flip operator. The eigenstates of σx are |+x⟩ and |-x⟩, which are superpositions of |↑⟩ and |↓⟩. But our state is in the σz basis. So I think I can compute ⟨σx⟩ by expressing ψ in terms of the σx eigenstates or perhaps use another approach.

Alternatively, I remember that for any observable, the expectation value is the sum of probabilities times the eigenvalues. But since σx doesn't diagonalize in the σz basis, maybe I should calculate it directly.

The operator σx is represented by the matrix [[0,1],[1,0]]. So let's compute ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩.

The state ψ is in a superposition, so let's write ψ as a column vector. |↑⟩ is [1; 0], and |↓⟩ is [0; 1]. So ψ is [0.5; sqrt(3)/2 ].

So σx is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So σx|ψ⟩ would be the vector [sqrt(3)/2; 0.5 ].

Then, the inner product ⟨ψ| σx |ψ⟩ is [0.5*, (sqrt(3)/2)* ] multiplied by [sqrt(3)/2; 0.5 ].

Wait, since the coefficients are real, the conjugate doesn't matter. So it's 0.5 * (sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2) * 0.5.

Wait, no
