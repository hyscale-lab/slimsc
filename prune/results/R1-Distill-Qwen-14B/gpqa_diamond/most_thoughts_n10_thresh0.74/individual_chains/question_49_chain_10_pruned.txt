Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of pericyclic reactions. But let's take it step by step.

The question involves three reactions, all of which are sigmatropic rearrangements. I remember that sigmatropic rearrangements involve the shift of a sigma bond, and the pi bonds migrate. The most common ones are Cope and Claisen rearrangements. Oh wait, but there are others too, like the Claisen being a [3,3] sigmatropic rearrangement. Oh right, and in these reactions, the sigma bond moves, and the pi bonds rearrange accordingly.

The first reaction is between 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine and but-3-en-2-ol under H+ and heat. Hmm. Let me visualize the structures. 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine would be something like (CH3O)2CHNH2. But wait, wait, the structure is actually (CH3O)CH2-NH2? Or maybe it's like (CH2OCH3)2NH? No, no, wait: 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine would be CH2(NH2)(OCH3)2. So the ethanamine has two methoxy groups on the same carbon as the amino group.

But-3-en-2-ol is CH2CH2CH(OH)CH2? No, wait. But-3-en-2-ol is CH2CH(OH)CH2CH2? No, wait: but-3-en-2-ol would be CH2(OH)CH2CH2CH2? No, wait the double bond is between C3 and C4? Wait no, but-3-en-2-ol is HOCH2CH2CH=CH2? Wait, no. Wait, but-3-en-2-ol: the structure is CH2(OH)CH2CH2CH3? No, that's a single bond. Oh wait, but-3-en-2-ol is CH2(OH)CH2CH2CH2? No, because but-3-en is CH2CH2CH=CH2... Hmm, I'm getting confused. Wait, but-3-en-2-
