Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the energy required for a certain nucleus to reach a speed of 0.96c. Hmm, I've heard a bit about RHIC before, but I'm not exactly an expert. Let me think through this step by step.

The question says: What is the energy of the RHIC so that the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96c. The nucleus X is defined as Li with 3 neutrons. Oh right, Li is lithium. So lithium has an atomic number of 3. If it has 3 neutrons, the isotope must be Li-6, because 3 protons plus 3 neutrons equals 6 nucleons. So the mass number A is 6.

Wait, actually, wait. Let me double-check. The problem states that X is Li with 3 neutrons. Lithium normally has 3 protons. So if there are 3 neutrons, the mass number is 3 + 3 = 6. So X is Li-6, right? So the nucleus has 6 nucleons.

So, the speed is 0.96 times the speed of light. I remember that for relativistic speeds, we have to use the relativistic energy equations. The total energy of a particle is given by gamma times the rest mass energy. So E = gamma * m0c².

But wait, the problem is asking for the total energy provided by RHIC. So I need to calculate the relativistic energy of the nucleus when it's moving at 0.96c.

First, I should find the gamma factor for v = 0.96c. Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Let me compute that.

v = 0.96c, so v²/c² = (0.96)^2 = 0.9216.

1 - v²/c² = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784) is sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28. Because 0.28^2 is 0.0784. So gamma is 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.5714.

Wait,
