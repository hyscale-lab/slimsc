Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this physics problem. Let me read it again carefully.

The question is about particles being collided at the center of a spherical detector. These particles are new types that decay quickly. They travel at ultra-relativistic velocities with a Lorentz factor of about 20. On average, one third of these particles reach the inner walls of the detector. The detector has a radius of 30 meters. The question is asking what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of the particles reach the inner walls.

Hmm, okay. So, I remember that the Lorentz factor, gamma, relates to time dilation and length contraction in relativity. Since these particles are moving at ultra-relativistic speeds, their lifetime as measured in the lab frame would be longer than their proper lifetime because of time dilation.

Wait, but wait. The particles are fast-decaying, so their lifetime is probably their proper lifetime (tau), and the time they have to travel to reach the detector wall is determined by their speed and the distance, but also affected by time dilation.

So, the key here is that the particles' lifetime in the lab frame is gamma multiplied by their proper lifetime (tau). So the lifetime in the lab is gamma * tau.

The distance they need to travel is the radius of the detector, which is 30 meters. The particles are moving at a speed close to the speed of light. Let's denote c as the speed of light, approximately 3e8 meters per second.

The time it takes for a particle to reach the detector's wall is t = distance / speed. Since the particles are ultra-relativistic, their speed is approximately c. So t = 30 m / c.

But wait, from the lab frame, the particle's lifetime is gamma * tau. So for the particle to reach the wall, the time measured in the lab (t) must be less than or equal to gamma * tau. Otherwise, the particle decays before reaching the wall.

So the condition for a particle to reach the wall is t â‰¤ gamma * tau.

But wait, the problem says that on average, one third of the particles reach the detector walls when gamma is 20. So when gamma is 20, the fraction reaching the wall is 1/3. They want to find the gamma where that fraction is 2/3.

Wait, I think I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The fraction
