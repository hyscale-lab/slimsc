Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonances and their decay distances. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The question is asking for the mean decay distance of a meson X. The given parameters are E_X = 8 GeV, m_X = 1.2 GeV, and Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are A to D, each with different values in meters.

Wait, I remember that the mean decay distance is related to the particle's lifetime. Oh right! The mean lifetime τ is connected to the decay width Γ by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. The formula I think is Γ = ħ / τ, which means τ = ħ / Γ. But wait, I should double-check that. Oh yes, Γ is the total decay width, and it's related to the lifetime via τ = ħ/(Γ). So the lifetime is inversely proportional to the decay width.

Once I have the lifetime, to find the mean decay distance, I probably need to multiply the lifetime by the particle's velocity and its lifetime. So, the mean path L = v * τ. But wait, what's the velocity here? The particles are moving relativistically, so I should use the relativistic velocity expression.

Wait, but the production energy E_X is given as 8 GeV, which is higher than the rest mass m_X of 1.2 GeV. So the meson is moving at a relativistic speed. How do I find
