Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's break it down.

The question starts with Compound A, which has a proton NMR with two signals. The first is a triplet at 0.9 ppm integrating for 6H, and the second is a quartet at 1.3 ppm integrating for 4H. Hmm, I remember that in NMR, the splitting tells us about neighboring protons. So a triplet means each proton is next to two others. The quartet would be next to three, right?

Looking at the integration, 6H is a triplet. That makes me think of maybe two equivalent CH3 groups. Because 2 CH3 groups would give 6H. And the quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. 4H could be two CH2 groups, perhaps. Wait, but 4H in a quartet... So each of those protons is next to three others. That might mean they are adjacent to a CH2 that's next to another CH2. Or maybe it's a single CH2 connected to another CH2, but that might not give a quartet. Wait, maybe the quartet is from a CH2 adjacent to a CH2 group with two protons. Let me think. So if a CH2 is next to another CH2, each proton would see two neighboring protons, leading to a triplet. But wait, noâ€”actually, splitting depends on the neighboring protons. So for a quartet, each proton is next to a group with three equivalent protons. Like, a CH2 next to a CH connected to three Hs? Or maybe it's a group like CH2CH2... Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, maybe the quartet comes from a CH2 that's next to a CH2 group, which has two protons each, so the splitting would be into a quartet. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused here.

So, let's think of possible structures for Compound A. The NMR suggests two sets of protons. The triplet at 0.9 ppm (6H) likely indicates two methyl groups (CH3) attached to a CH2. Because if you have two CH3 groups attached to a CH2, each CH3 proton is next to two protons (the two CH3 groups), hence a triplet. Wait, no. Wait, each CH3 is on a CH
