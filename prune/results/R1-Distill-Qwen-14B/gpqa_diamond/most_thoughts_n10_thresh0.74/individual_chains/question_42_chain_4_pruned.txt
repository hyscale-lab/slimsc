Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here. Hmm, let me read it again. So, there are three exoplanets, Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3. They're using the TTV method, which I think stands for transit timing variations. But I'm not sure if that's important for this problem.

The question is about the orbital periods of these planets. The given data includes the ratios of their equilibrium temperatures, the mass ratios, and their albedo. The albedo is the same for all three, which is 0.3, similar to Earth's. So, albedo isn't a variable here.

The problem gives the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 as approximately 1.4, and between Planet2 and Planet3 as 2.3. So, Planet1 is hotter than Planet2 by 40%, and Planet2 is hotter than Planet3 by 130%.

The mass ratios are also given. Planet1 to Planet2 is about 1.15, and Planet2 to Planet3 is about 1.35. So, Planet1 is 15% more massive than Planet2, and Planet2 is 35% more massive than Planet3. That would make Planet1 the most massive, followed by Planet2, then Planet3.

The question is asking by what factor the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than Planet1's. So, Period3 / Period1 = ?

I remember that the equilibrium temperature of a planet is related to its orbital period, but wait, no, the equilibrium temperature depends on the star's luminosity, the planet's distance from the star, and its albedo. Oh right, the formula for equilibrium temperature is T = [ (L (1 - a)) / (16 π σ D²) ) ]^(1/4), where L is stellar luminosity, a is albedo, σ is Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and D is the distance from the star.

Wait, but in this problem, the albedo is the same, 0.3, so a is same for all. So, the temperature ratio between two planets would depend on the inverse square root of their distances. Because T is proportional to (L/(D²))^(1/4), so T ~ D^(-1/2).

So, if T1 is the temperature of Planet1 and T2 that of Planet2, then T1/T2 = [ (D2² / D1² ) ]^(-1/4 ), wait, let me get the formula right. Let me think: T is proportional to sqrt( (L/(16 π σ D² (1-a)) )) ) /4? Wait, let's get the formula correctly.

The formula for equilibrium temperature is:

T = [ ( L (1 - a) ) / (16 π σ D²) ]^(1/4)

So, the ratio T1/T2 would be [ ( (L (1-a)) / D1² ) / ( (L (1-a)) / D2² ) ) ]^(1/4 )

Simplify that: [ (D2² / D1² ) ]^(1/4 ) = (D2/D1)^(1/2 )

So, T1 / T2 = (D2/D1)^(1/2 )

So, rearranged:

(D2/D1) = (T1 / T2 )^2

Wait, let me check: T1 = [ (L (1-a)) / (16 π σ D1²) ]^(1/4 )

Similarly for T2.

So, T1 / T2 = [ ( (L (1-a))/(D1²) ) / ( (L (1-a))/(D2²) ) ]^(1/4 )

Which is [ (D2² / D1² ) ]^(1/4 ) = (D2/D1)^(1/2 )

So yes, T1/T2 = sqrt( D2/D1 )

So, D2/D1 = (T1/T2)^2

Given that T1/T2 is approximately 1.4, so D2/D1 is (1.4)^2 = about 1.96.

So, D2 is about 1.96 times D1. So Planet2 is about twice as far from the star as Planet1.

Wait, but wait, the question gives the ratio of equilibrium temperatures as Planet1 to Planet2 is 1.4. So T1 is higher than T2. Since T is proportional to (1/D)^0.5. So higher T implies closer to the star. So Planet1 is closer than Planet2, so D1 < D2.

So, from T1/T2 = 1.4, D2/D1 = (1.4)^2 = 1.96. So D2 is about 1.96 times D1.

Similarly, the ratio between Planet2 and Planet3 is given as 2.3. So T2/T3 = 2.3.

So, applying the same formula:

(T2/T3) = sqrt( D3/D2 )

Wait wait, wait, let me be careful.

Wait, T2 is the temperature of Planet2, and T3 is Planet3's.

So, T2 / T3 = (D3/D2 )^(1/2 )

So, D3/D2 = (T2/T3 )^2

So, T2/T3 is 2.3, so (2.3)^2 = approx 5.29.

So D3 = D2 * 5.29.

So, D3 is about 5.29 times D2.

But earlier, D2 is 1.96 times D1.

So D3 = D2 * 5.29 = 1.96 *5.29 *
