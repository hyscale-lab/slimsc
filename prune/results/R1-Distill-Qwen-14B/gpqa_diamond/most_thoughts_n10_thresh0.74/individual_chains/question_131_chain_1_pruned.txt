Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this organic chemistry problem. Let's take it step by step. 

First, the problem says that a dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene was dehydrated to form an anhydride. So, the starting material is a dicarboxylic acid—something like HOOC-(CH2)n-CH2-COOH, but wait, no. Wait, actually, since the acid has a cis-alkene, it's probably something like HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH but with a double bond. Wait, no—maybe more accurately, it's HOOC-CH2-CH2-CH2-COOH, but that's not a double bond. Oh, wait, the dicarboxylic acid has a cis-alkene, so maybe it's HOOC-CH2-CH2-CH2-COOH with a double bond? No, wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe the structure is HOOC-CH2-CH2-CH2-COOH, but with a double bond between the middle carbons. Wait, perhaps it's more like HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH, but that's not a double bond. Hmm, maybe the structure is HOOC-CH2-CH=CH-CH2-COOH? No, wait, maybe the double bond is in the chain between the two carboxylic acid groups. So, the dicarboxylic acid would be something like HOOC-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-COOH, but with a double bond. Oh wait, perhaps HOOC-CH2-CH=CH-CH2-COOH. But the dehydration would lead to an anhydride. 

When you dehydrate a dicarboxylic acid with a double bond, you lose water and form an anhydride. So, the structure of the anhydride would have two carboxylate groups connected by an oxygen bridge. But wait, originally, the acid has a cis-alkene. So the dehydration would happen across the double bond, forming an anhydride. Wait, no, the dehydration of a diacid with a double bond would typically form an anhydride if it's a vicinal diacid. For example, HOOC-CH2-CH(OH
