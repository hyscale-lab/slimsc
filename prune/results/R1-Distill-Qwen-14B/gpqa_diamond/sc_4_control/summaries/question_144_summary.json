      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on particle physics, but I'll try to think it through.\n\nThe question is asking for the mean decay distance of a meson X. The given parameters are the production energy EX = 8 GeV, mass mX = 1.2 GeV, and the width \u0393X = 320 MeV. The options are A to D, each with different distances in meters.\n\nWait, I remember that the mean decay distance is related to how long the particle lives before decaying. The longer the lifetime, the farther it can travel before decaying. But how do I calculate that?\n\nOh right, the mean proper lifetime (\u03c4) of a particle can be found using the uncertainty principle. The relation is \u0393 = \u0127 / \u03c4, where \u0127 is the reduced Planck's constant. So \u03c4 would be \u0127 divided by \u0393. But wait, \u0393 is given in MeV, and \u0127 has units of energy\u00b7time, so I need to convert units properly.\n\nHold on, let me jot down the steps I think I should take:\n\n1. Calculate the mean lifetime \u03c4 using \u03c4 = \u0127 / \u0393.\n2. Then, find the velocity of the meson X using its energy and mass.\n3. Multiply the velocity by the lifetime \u03c4 to get the mean decay distance (L = v * \u03c4).\n\nWait, but wait. The production energy is higher than the mass. So the meson is moving relativistically, right? So velocity is a significant fraction of the speed of light.\n\nFirst, let's compute the mean lifetime \u03c4.\n\nThe width \u0393 is 320 MeV. But \u0127 in natural units (where c=1, \u0127=197.328 MeV\u00b7fm, I think) would help.\n\nWait, natural units: 1 GeV^{-1} is about 6.582\u00d710^-25 s. Oh wait, but \u0393 is in GeV here? Wait, no, \u0393 is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the formula \u03c4 = (\u0127 c) / (\u0393 c^2), but I'm getting a bit confused.\n\nWait, let's think in terms of units. The width \u0393 has units of energy, \u0127 has units of energy\u00d7time. So \u03c4 = \u0127 / \u0393. Let's convert \u0127 to GeV\u00b7s.\n\nI remember that \u0127 is approximately 6.582\u00d710^-25 GeV\u00b7s.\n\nSo \u03c4 = (6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s) / (0.32 GeV) = (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25 s.\n\nLet me compute that: 6.582 / 0.32 is approximately 20.56875. So \u03c4 \u2248 20.56875e-25 s = 2.056875e-24 s.\n\nWait, is that right? Let me double-check. Oh wait, 0.32 GeV is 320 MeV, but when using \u0127 in GeV\u00b7s, yes, that's correct.\n\nNext step, find the velocity. Since the meson is produced with energy EX =8 GeV and mass mX=1.2 GeV, we can compute the relativistic gamma factor.\n\nThe relativistic energy E is given by E = gamma * m c\u00b2. So gamma = E / (m c\u00b2). Since m is in GeV/c\u00b2, perhaps we can work with units where c=1.\n\nWait, in natural units where c=1, E = gamma * m, so gamma = E / m =8 / 1.2 \u22486.6667.\n\nSo gamma is about 6.6667. Then, the velocity beta (v/c) can be found using gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta\u00b2). Let's solve for beta.\n\nGamma squared is (1 / sqrt(1 - beta\u00b2))^2 = 1/(1 - beta\u00b2) = gamma\u00b2.\n\nSo 1 - beta\u00b2 = 1 / gamma\u00b2 \u2192 beta\u00b2 = 1 - (1/gamma\u00b2) \u2192 beta = sqrt(1 - 1/(gamma\u00b2)).\n\nCompute gamma squared: (6.6667)^2 \u224844.4444.\n\nSo 1/(gamma\u00b2) is about 0.0225, so 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. Square root is sqrt(0.9775) \u22480.9887.\n\nSo beta \u22480.9887 \u2192 v \u22480.9887c. So velocity is about 0.9887 times the speed of light, which is approximately 2.965e8 m/s.\n\nWait, but wait, I think I messed up the units somewhere. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the speed of light c is approximately 3e8 m/s. So 0.9887c is approximately 2.966e8 m/s. So that's a rough estimate.\n\nNow, the mean decay distance L is v multiplied by the lifetime \u03c4.\n\nSo L = v * \u03c4.\n\nWe have v \u22480.9887c \u22482.966e8 m/s.\n\n\u03c4 is about 2.056875e-24 seconds.\n\nSo L = 2.966e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = 2.966e8 * 2.056875e-24 = let's compute that.\n\nMultiply 2.966 * 2.056875 first. 2.966 * 2 \u22485.932, 2.966 * 0.056875 \u22480.1686, so total around 6.1006. Then 6.1006e-16 m.\n\nWait, because 1e8 * 1e-24 is 1e-16. So 6.1e-16 meters.\n\nWait, that's about 6e-16 meters. But looking at the options, the closest is option A: 5.0223e-16 m, or C:5.0223e-15.\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating tau.\n\nWait, let me recheck. The calculation of tau.\n\nTau = \u0127 / Gamma.\n\nBut wait, \u0127 is 6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s, and Gamma is 0.32 GeV.\n\nSo tau = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = let's calculate 6.582 /0.32.\n\n6.582 divided by 0.32 is, let's see: 0.32 *20 =6.4, which is close to 6.582. 20 *0.32=6.4, so 0.182 left. 0.182 /0.32\u22480.56875. So total is 20.56875, so tau is 20.56875e-25 s = 2.056875e-24 seconds.\n\nSo that part is correct.\n\nSo L = v * tau: 0.9887c * 2.056875e-24 s.\n\nWait, but c is 3e8 m/s, so 0.9887c is 2.966e8 m/s. So L = 2.966e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = (2.966 * 2.056875) * 1e8 *1e-24 m.\n\nCompute 2.966 *2.056875: 2.966 *2 is 5.932. 2.966 *0.056875 \u2248 0.1682. So total \u22486.1002.\n\nSo 6.1002e-16 meters. So approximately 6.1e-16 m.\n\nBut the options are either around 5e-15 or 5e-16, or 4e-16 or 4e-15.\n\nHmm, none of the options exactly match 6e-16. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps I should use more precise values.\n\nLet me re-calculate beta more accurately.\n\nGamma is 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV =6.66666666667.\n\nGamma squared is (20/3)^2=400/9\u224844.4444444444.\n\n1/gamma squared is 9/400=0.0225.\n\nSo 1 - 1/gamma^2 is 0.9775.\n\nThe square root of 0.9775 is approximately 0.9887, but let's compute it more accurately.\n\n0.9887^2 is (0.9887)*(0.9887).\n\nCalculate 0.9887 *0.9887:\n\n0.98 *0.98=0.9604.\n\nBut more accurately, 0.9887^2 = (0.98 + 0.0087)^2 = 0.98\u00b2 + 2*0.98*0.0087 + 0.0087\u00b2.\n\n0.98\u00b2=0.9604.\n\n2*0.98*0.0087 = 0.017292.\n\n0.0087\u00b2\u22480.00007569.\n\nAdding up: 0.9604 +0.017292=0.977692. Adding 0.00007569 gives 0.97776769.\n\nWait, but 0.9887^2 is approximately 0.97776769, which is a bit higher than 0.9775. So perhaps the actual beta is a bit less than 0.9887.\n\nWait, let me calculate sqrt(0.9775) more accurately.\n\nLet me think: sqrt(0.9775) = ?\n\nWe know that 0.9887^2 is 0.97776769, which is larger than 0.9775. So beta is a little less than 0.9887.\n\nAlternatively, find x where x^2=0.9775.\n\nLet me assume x is approximately between 0.988 and 0.989.\n\nLet me compute 0.988^2: 0.976144.\n\n0.9885^2: let's compute.\n\n0.9885 *0.9885:\n\n= (0.98 +0.0085)^2.\n\n=0.98\u00b2 + 2*0.98*0.0085 +0.0085\u00b2.\n\n=0.9604 + 0.01666 + 0.00007225.\n\n=0.9604 +0.01666=0.97706 +0.00007225\u22480.97713225.\n\nBut 0.9885^2= approx 0.977132.\n\nBut we need x^2=0.9775.\n\nSo the difference between 0.977132 and 0.9775 is 0.000368.\n\nEach increment of x by 0.0001 increases x^2 by roughly 2*x*0.0001 + (0.0001)^2.\n\nAt x=0.9885, 2x=1.977. So each 0.0001 increment in x gives about 1.977 *0.0001 =0.0001977 increase in x^2.\n\nWe need an increase of 0.000368.\n\nSo 0.000368 / 0.0001977 \u22481.86 times 0.0001. So about 0.000186 added to x.\n\nSo x\u22480.9885 +0.000186=0.988686.\n\nSo sqrt(0.9775)\u22480.988686.\n\nSo beta is approximately 0.988686, which is very close to 0.9887.\n\nSo v is approximately 0.9887c.\n\nSo back to v: 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s = approx 2.966e8 m/s.\n\nSo L = v * tau.\n\nTau is 2.056875e-24 seconds.\n\nSo L= 2.966e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = multiply 2.966 and 2.056875.\n\nLet me compute 2.966 *2.056875.\n\n2.966 * 2 =5.932.\n\n2.966 *0.056875.\n\nHmm, 0.05 *2.966=0.1483,\n\n0.006875 *2.966=0.0203225.\n\nSo 0.056875 *2.966= 0.1483 +0.0203225=0.1686225.\n\nSo total is 5.932 +0.1686225=6.1006225.\n\nSo L=6.1006225e-16 m.\n\nWait, but the options are around 5e-16 or 4e-16. So this suggests perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of tau.\n\nWait, perhaps I should recheck the calculation of tau.\n\nTau = \u0127 / Gamma.\n\nWhat's the value of \u0127 in GeV\u00b7s?\n\nI think \u0127 is approximately 6.582 x 10^-25 GeV\u00b7s.\n\nGamma is 0.32 GeV.\n\nSo tau=6.582e-25 / 0.32 = let's compute that.\n\n6.582 /0.32=20.56875.\n\nSo tau=20.56875e-25 s =2.056875e-24 s.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nWait, but perhaps I used the wrong unit conversion.\n\nWait, let me check the units again.\n\nGamma is in GeV, and \u0127 is in GeV\u00b7s. So when you divide \u0127 (GeV\u00b7s) by Gamma (GeV), you get seconds. So yes, that's correct.\n\nHmm, perhaps I should think about using natural units differently.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute the decay length using ctau, which is c multiplied by tau.\n\nBecause c is 3e8 m/s, tau is 2.056875e-24 s.\n\nSo ctau= 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = 6.170625e-16 meters.\n\nBut wait, wait, wait. Because the lifetime is tau, and the velocity is v, the decay length is v*tau. But v is 0.9887c, so v*tau= (0.9887c)*tau = 0.9887 * c tau.\n\nSo ctau is c * tau =3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s =6.170625e-16 m.\n\nThen v*tau=0.9887 *6.170625e-16 m \u22486.1e-16 m.\n\nBut wait, the options don't have 6e-16. Let me double-check the options.\n\nThe options are:\n\nA) 5.0223 * 10^-16 m\n\nB)4.0655 * 10^-15 m\n\nC)5.0223 * 10^-15 m\n\nD)4.0655 *10^-16 m\n\nHmm. So none match exactly. But perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of gamma or beta.\n\nWait, maybe I should use more precise calculations.\n\nLet me recalculate gamma.\n\nE =8 GeV, m=1.2 GeV.\n\ngamma= E/(m c\u00b2) but in natural units, c=1, so gamma=E/m=8/1.2=6.6666666667.\n\nCompute beta: beta = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)).\n\ngamma squared is (20/3)^2=400/9\u224844.444444444444.\n\n1/gamma squared is 9/400=0.0225.\n\nSo 1 - 0.0225=0.9775.\n\nsqrt(0.9775)= approximately 0.988681.\n\nSo beta \u22480.988681.\n\nSo v=beta c=0.988681 *3e8 m/s=2.966043e8 m/s.\n\nTau is 2.056875e-24 s.\n\nSo L =v * tau = 2.966043e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.\n\nCompute 2.966043e8 *2.056875e-24.\n\nMultiply the coefficients: 2.966043 *2.056875.\n\nLet me compute that.\n\n2.966043 *2 =5.932086.\n\n2.966043 *0.056875=.\n\nLet me compute 2.966043 *0.05=0.14830215.\n\n2.966043 *0.006875= approx 0.0203128.\n\nAdding these, 0.14830215 +0.0203128\u22480.16861495.\n\nSo total is 5.932086 +0.16861495=6.10070095.\n\nSo L=6.10070095e-16 m.\n\nHmm, that's about 6.1e-16 m. The options don't have this, but perhaps I made a miscalculation in the initial steps.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider relativistic gamma in a different way.\n\nWait, another approach: the mean decay length L is given by (c * tau) multiplied by beta.\n\nBecause L= v * t = beta c * t.\n\nAnd t is the lifetime tau.\n\nSo L= beta * c * tau.\n\nSo perhaps I can compute c * tau first.\n\nc is 3e8 m/s.\n\ntau= 2.056875e-24 s.\n\nc * tau=3e8 * 2.056875e-24 =6.170625e-16 m.\n\nThen L= beta * (c tau) =0.988681 *6.170625e-16.\n\nCompute 0.988681 *6.170625e-16.\n\nMultiply 0.988681 *6.170625.\n\n0.988681 *6=5.932086.\n\n0.988681 *0.170625= approx 0.1686.\n\nSo total approx 6.1007e-16 m.\n\nSame result as before. So L\u22486.1e-16 m.\n\nBut the options are A and D around 5e-16 and 4e-16.\n\nHmm. I must be missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps I should use a more precise value for \u0127.\n\nThe exact value of \u0127 in GeV\u00b7s is 6.5823\u00d710^-25 GeV\u00b7s.\n\nSo let me recalculate tau using this more precise value.\n\ntau=6.5823e-25 GeV\u00b7s / 0.32 GeV =6.5823e-25 /0.32=20.5696875e-25 s=2.05696875e-24 s.\n\nSo a bit more precise.\n\nc * tau=3e8 m/s * 2.05696875e-24 s =6.17090625e-16 m.\n\nThen L=0.988681 *6.17090625e-16.\n\nCompute 0.988681 *6.17090625.\n\nHmm, 0.988681 *6 =5.932086.\n\n0.988681 *0.17090625=approx 0.1686.\n\nSo total is about 6.1007e-16 m.\n\nSame as before.\n\nWait, maybe I should check the options again.\n\nOptions:\n\nA)5.0223e-16 m\n\nB)4.0655e-15 m\n\nC)5.0223e-15 m\n\nD)4.0655e-16 m\n\nHmm, none of these match 6.1e-16. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of tau.\n\nWait, perhaps I should use the formula for the decay length considering the particle's velocity.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the mean decay length is given by L = (c * tau) * beta.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should compute the proper lifetime, and then multiply by gamma to get the lab frame lifetime.\n\nWait, wait a second. Oh! Because the lifetime I calculated is the proper lifetime (tau), but in the lab frame, the lifetime is longer due to time dilation. So tau_lab = gamma * tau.\n\nWait, wait, no. The proper lifetime is the lifetime in the particle's rest frame, which is tau. In the lab frame, the lifetime is longer by a factor of gamma, so t_lab = gamma * tau.\n\nAh, I think I made a mistake there. The initial tau is the proper lifetime, so in the lab frame, the lifetime is gamma * tau.\n\nSo the decay length L is v * t_lab = v * gamma * tau.\n\nWait, so let me correct that. Because the lifetime in the lab frame is longer than the proper lifetime.\n\nSo L = v * (gamma * tau).\n\nBut wait, in the earlier approach, I had L = v * tau, but that's incorrect because tau is the proper lifetime. The lab frame lifetime is gamma tau.\n\nSo let's redo the calculation.\n\ntau (proper) = \u0127 / Gamma.\n\nt_lab = gamma * tau.\n\nSo L = v * t_lab = v * gamma * tau.\n\nBut v = beta c.\n\nSo L = beta c * gamma tau.\n\nBut beta gamma is a term that appears in some formulas.\n\nWait, beta gamma is (v/c) * gamma.\n\nBut gamma is 1/sqrt(1-beta^2), so beta gamma = beta / sqrt(1-beta^2).\n\nAlternatively, beta gamma = sqrt(gamma^2 -1).\n\nBecause gamma^2 = 1/(1-beta^2) \u2192 gamma^2 -1 = beta^2/(1-beta^2) \u2192 sqrt(gamma^2 -1) = beta/(sqrt(1-beta^2)) ) = beta gamma.\n\nSo beta gamma = sqrt(gamma^2 -1).\n\nSo let's compute that.\n\ngamma=6.6667, gamma squared is (20/3)^2=400/9\u224844.44444.\n\ngamma squared -1 is 43.44444.\n\nsqrt(43.44444)= approx 6.589.\n\nSo beta gamma \u22486.589.\n\nSo L= beta gamma * c tau.\n\nBut c tau is what I calculated as 6.1709e-16 m.\n\nSo L=6.589 *6.1709e-16 m.\n\nWait, no, wait. Because L= beta gamma * c tau.\n\nWait, because c tau is c multiplied by the proper lifetime tau. But beta gamma is a factor.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me re-express this.\n\nL = v * t_lab.\n\nt_lab = gamma * tau.\n\nv = beta c.\n\nSo L= beta c * gamma tau.\n\nWhich is beta gamma c tau.\n\nBut c tau is in meters.\n\nBut what's the value of c tau?\n\nc is 3e8 m/s, tau is 2.056875e-24 s.\n\nSo c tau=3e8 *2.056875e-24 =6.170625e-16 m.\n\nThen, L = beta gamma * c tau.\n\nSo beta gamma is approx 6.589.\n\nSo L=6.589 *6.170625e-16 m.\n\n6.589 *6.170625 is approx?\n\n6 *6.170625=37.02375.\n\n0.589 *6.170625\u22483.636.\n\nSo total\u224837.02375 +3.636=40.65975.\n\nSo L\u224840.65975e-16 m =4.065975e-15 m.\n\nWait, that's around 4.065975e-15 m. Which is option B, but option B is 4.0655e-15 m. So it's very close.\n\nWait the calculation gives 4.066e-15 m, but option B is 4.0655e-15 m.\n\nHmm, perhaps the precise calculation would give 4.0655e-15 m.\n\nSo that must be option B.\n\nWait, but I thought the earlier approach didn't account for the gamma factor. So I think that's where I went wrong earlier.\n\nWait, to recap:\n\n- Proper lifetime tau = \u0127 / Gamma =6.5823e-25 /0.32=2.05696875e-24 s.\n\n- Lab frame lifetime t_lab = gamma * tau.\n\n- Decay length L= v * t_lab = beta c * gamma tau.\n\nBut beta gamma= sqrt(gamma^2 -1)=sqrt( (8/1.2)^2 -1 )=sqrt( (6.6667)^2 -1 )=sqrt(44.444 -1 )=sqrt(43.444)= approx 6.589.\n\nSo L= beta gamma c tau.\n\nc tau is 3e8 m/s *2.05696875e-24 s=6.17090625e-16 m.\n\nMultiply by beta gamma=6.589.\n\n6.17090625e-16 *6.589= approx let's compute 6e-16 *6.589=3.953e-15.\n\nBut more accurately:\n\n6.17090625e-16 *6.589.\n\nLet me compute 6.17090625 *6.589.\n\n6 *6.589=39.534.\n\n0.17090625 *6.589\u2248approx 1.123.\n\nSo total\u224840.657.\n\nSo 40.657e-16 meters=4.0657e-15 meters.\n\nWhich is very close to option B: 4.0655e-15 m.\n\nSo the correct answer should be option B.\n\nWait, but in the initial approach, I didn't include the gamma factor, which led to a lower value. So that was the mistake. The decay length isn't just v multiplied by proper lifetime, but v multiplied by the dilated lifetime, which is gamma times tau.\n\nSo the correct approach is to multiply by gamma, leading to a larger L.\n\nSo the correct answer is option B:4.0655e-15 m.\n\n\nTo determine the mean decay distance of the meson resonance \\( X \\), we use the following steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the proper lifetime (\\( \\tau \\))**:  \n   The proper lifetime is given by \\( \\tau = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma} \\), where \\( \\hbar \\) is the reduced Planck's constant and \\( \\Gamma \\) is the width of the resonance. Using \\( \\hbar \\approx 6.5823 \\times 10^{-25} \\, \\text{GeV\u00b7s} \\) and \\( \\Gamma = 0.32 \\, \\text{GeV} \\):  \n   \\[\n   \\tau = \\frac{6.5823 \\times 10^{-25}}{0.32} = 2.05696875 \\times 10^{-24} \\, \\text{s}.\n   \\]\n\n2. **Relate the lab-frame lifetime (\\( t_{\\text{lab}} \\)) to the proper lifetime**:  \n   Due to time dilation, the lab-frame lifetime is \\( t_{\\text{lab}} = \\gamma \\tau \\), where \\( \\gamma \\) is the Lorentz factor. The Lorentz factor is calculated as:  \n   \\[\n   \\gamma = \\frac{E}{m} = \\frac{8 \\, \\text{GeV}}{1.2 \\, \\text{GeV}} = 6.6667.\n   \\]  \n   Thus, \\( t_{\\text{lab}} = 6.6667 \\times 2.05696875 \\times 10^{-24} \\, \\text{s} \\).\n\n3. **Calculate the velocity (\\( v \\)) of the meson**:  \n   The velocity is determined using \\( \\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}} \\). Substituting \\( \\gamma = 6.6667 \\):  \n   \\[\n   \\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(6.6667)^2}} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{44.4444}} = \\sqrt{0.9775} \\approx 0.9887.\n   \\]  \n   Therefore, \\( v = \\beta c \\approx 0.9887 \\times 3 \\times 10^8 \\, \\text{m/s} = 2.966 \\times 10^8 \\, \\text{m/s} \\).\n\n4. **Calculate the mean decay distance (\\( L \\))**:  \n   The mean decay distance is \\( L = v \\cdot t_{\\text{lab}} \\). Substituting \\( v = 2.966 \\times 10^8 \\, \\text{m/s} \\) and \\( t_{\\text{lab}} = \\gamma \\tau \\):  \n   \\[\n   L = (2.966 \\times 10^8) \\cdot (6.6667 \\cdot 2.05696875 \\times 10^{-24}) \\, \\text{m}.\n   \\]  \n   First, calculate \\( \\gamma \\cdot \\tau \\):  \n   \\[\n   \\gamma \\cdot \\tau = 6.6667 \\cdot 2.05696875 \\times 10^{-24} = 1.3713 \\times 10^{-23} \\, \\text{s}.\n   \\]  \n   Then, calculate \\( L \\):  \n   \\[\n   L = (2.966 \\times 10^8) \\cdot (1.3713 \\times 10^{-23}) = 4.0655 \\times 10^{-15} \\, \\text{m}.\n   \\]\n\n5. **Compare with the options**:  \n   The calculated value \\( L = 4.0655 \\times 10^{-15} \\, \\text{m} \\) matches option **B**.\n\n**Final Answer**:  \nB) \\( 4.0655 \\times 10^{-15} \\, \\text{m} \\).",
