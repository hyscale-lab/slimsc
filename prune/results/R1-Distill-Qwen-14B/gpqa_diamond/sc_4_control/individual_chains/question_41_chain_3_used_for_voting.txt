Okay, so I have this physics problem about the speed of light in a moving medium. Hmm, let me see. The question says a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the lab. I need to find the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer. The options are given, and I have to choose the correct one.

Wait, I remember that in a medium, the speed of light is c/n, where c is the speed of light in vacuum. But here, the glass is moving. So how does that affect the speed as observed in the lab?

I'm a bit confused because normally, when a medium is moving, the speed of light in that medium doesn't change in the same way as a material object. I think this is where relativity comes into play, but I'm not sure. Let me think about the principles involved.

In classical mechanics, velocities add linearly. So if the glass is moving at speed v towards the observer, and the light is moving at speed u in the glass, then relative to the lab frame, the speed would be u plus v, but only if they're in the same direction. Wait, but that's for material objects, not for light.

Wait, no. Because light always moves at c in a vacuum according to Einstein's postulate, regardless of the source's motion. But what about in a medium? Because here, the medium (glass) itself is moving.

Hmm, maybe I should think about this using the concept of frame transformations. Like, the glass is moving at velocity v relative to the lab frame. Inside the glass, the speed of light is c/n. But how does that translate when the glass is moving.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the Doppler effect. But I'm not sure if that's applicable here because the Doppler effect relates to frequency or wavelength changes, not necessarily the speed of light in the medium.

Wait another approach: the speed of light in the glass, as observed in the lab frame. Let me denote the speed of light in the glass as v_light. In the glass's rest frame, v_light is c/n. But since the glass is moving, how does that affect the observed speed?

Wait, no. Because the speed of light in a medium depends on the medium's motion relative to the observer. Oh wait, no, that's not exactly right. The speed of light in a medium depends on the medium's properties, not its velocity, according to relativity. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, another thought: the speed of light in the glass is c/n as measured in the glass's rest frame. But when the glass is moving, the lab frame sees the light's speed differently. Wait, but according to relativity, the speed of light in any inertial frame is c. Wait, that can't be right because the light is inside the glass. So maybe that's a point of confusion.

Wait, the speed of light in the glass is c/n in the glass's rest frame. But when the glass is moving, how do we find the speed of the light beam as observed from the lab?

Hmm, perhaps I should use the velocity addition formula from special relativity. Because in relativity, velocities don't just add linearly. The formula is u' = (u + v)/(1 + (u*v)/c²), where u is the velocity in the moving frame (glass's frame) and v is the velocity of the glass relative to the lab.

Wait, but wait, the glass is moving at velocity v towards the observer. The light is moving along with the glass. So in the glass frame, the light's speed is c/n. So u is c/n, and the glass is moving at velocity v (same direction as the light) in the lab frame. So the lab will see u' as (u + v)/(1 + (u v)/c²).

Substituting u = c/n, u' = ( (c/n) + v ) / (1 + ( (c/n) * v ) / c² )

Let me compute that denominator: 1 + (v/(n c)). Because (c/n)*v is v/(n), then divided by c²: v/(n c²). Wait, no. Wait, (c/n) * v = (v c)/n. Then, when divided by c², it's (v c)/(n c²) )= v/(n c).

So denominator becomes 1 + (v)/(n c).

Putting it together: u' = [ (c/n + v ) ] / [ 1 + (v)/(n c) ]

Let me factor out 1/n from numerator and denominator. Let me see:

Numerator: c/n + v = (c + n v ) / n.

Denominator: 1 + v/(n c) = [ n c + v ] / (n c )

So u' = [ (c + n v)/n ] / [ (n c + v ) / (n c) ) ]

Which is equal to [ (c + n v)/n ] * [ n c / (n c + v) ) ]

The n's cancel: (c + n v) cancels with denominator (n c + v)?

Wait, wait, let me compute:

(c + n v) is the same as (n c + v) only if c = v. Which is not the case. Wait, no. Oh wait, no, (c + n v) is not the same as (n c + v) unless n=1 and v=c, which is impossible. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, the numerator is (c + n v)/n, and denominator is (n c + v)/(n c). So when I invert and multiply, I get (c + n v)/n * (n c)/(n c + v) ) = [ (c + n v) * n c ] / [ n (n c + v) ) ]

The n in the numerator and denominator cancel: [ (c +n v) c ] / (n c + v )

Let me factor numerator and denominator:

Numerator: c (c + n v )

Denominator: n c + v = c n + v.

Wait, that's the same as (c + n v) multiplied by n? No, denominator is n c + v.

Wait, so unless (c +n v) is somehow similar, but I don't see a cancellation. Let me write it as:

(c (c + n v )) / (n c + v )

Wait, that can't be further simplified unless I factor differently.

Wait, another way, perhaps I should factor out c from denominator and numerator.

Wait, let's factor c from denominator: n c + v = c (n) + v. Hmm, that's not helpful.

Wait, but if I write denominator as c (n) + v, and numerator as c (c + n v), perhaps I can factor something else.

Alternatively, perhaps I should factor v from numerator and denominator.

Wait, not sure. Let me think about the possible options given.

The options are A: (1 +n v)/(n +v ), B: 1, C: (1 +n v)/(n -v ), D: (1 -n v)/(n +v )

Wait, but in our calculation, the expression for u' is [ (c + n v) c ] / [ n (n c +v ) ].

Wait, but if I divide numerator and denominator by c², we can perhaps get something.

Wait, because c is the speed of light in vacuum, which is 1 in the problem statement. Because the problem says to take c=1. So c=1.

Ah, that's an important point. So c=1.

So let's substitute c=1 into our expression.

So u' becomes: [ (1 + n v) * 1 ] / [ (n *1 + v) ]

Because when c=1, denominator is (n *1 + v) = n + v.

Wait, numerator is (1 + n v) * 1 = 1 + n v.

Denominator is n + v.

So u' = (1 + n v) / (n + v )

Wait, but wait, that's option A.

Wait, but wait, that's assuming that the velocity addition formula applies. But wait, the velocity addition formula is for when you're moving at velocity v relative to another frame, and you want to find the velocity u' of an object in the other frame. But in this case, the object is the light moving in the same direction as the glass's motion.

So according to the velocity addition formula, the lab frame would measure the speed as (u + v)/(1 + (u v)/c² )

Which with u = c/n = 1/n, and v being the speed of the glass towards the observer (same direction as the light), so v is positive.

So substitution: ( (1/n) + v ) / (1 + ( (1/n) v ) /1 )

Which is (1/n + v ) / (1 + v/(n) )

Multiply numerator and denominator by n:

(1 + n v ) / (n + v )

Which is option A.

Wait, but wait, the options are given with c=1. So the final expression is (1 +n v)/(n +v ), which is option A.

But another thing to consider: does the speed of light in the lab frame change? Because according to relativity, the speed of light in a vacuum is always c, but here it's in a medium. So perhaps in the lab frame, the speed is (1 +n v)/(n +v ), which is less than c if n and v are positive, but wait, when n=1, it would be (1 +v)/(1 +v )=1, which is c. So that makes sense.

Alternatively, when the medium is moving, the light's speed as observed in the lab frame is (1 +n v)/(n +v ). So the correct answer would be option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory, we start by noting that the speed of light in a medium is given by \( v_{\text{light}} = \frac{c}{n} \), where \( c \) is the speed of light in a vacuum and \( n \) is the index of refraction of the medium. However, since the glass is moving at a constant velocity \( v \) in the same direction as the light beam, we must account for this motion when calculating the observed speed of light in the lab frame.

Using the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
u' = \frac{u + v}{1 + \frac{u v}{c^2}},
\]

we substitute \( u = \frac{c}{n} \) (the speed of light in the glass as measured in its rest frame) and \( v \) (the velocity of the glass relative to the lab frame). Substituting \( c = 1 \) (as given in the problem), the formula becomes:

\[
u' = \frac{\frac{1}{n} + v}{1 + \frac{v}{n}}.
\]

To simplify, multiply the numerator and denominator by \( n \):

\[
u' = \frac{1 + n v}{n + v}.
\]

This matches option A. The other options can be ruled out as follows:
- Option B (\( 1 \)) is incorrect because it does not account for the motion of the glass or the index of refraction.
- Option C (\( \frac{1 + n v}{n - v} \)) is incorrect because the denominator does not match the relativistic velocity addition formula.
- Option D (\( \frac{1 - n v}{n + v} \)) is incorrect because the numerator does not match the relativistic velocity addition formula.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: A**
