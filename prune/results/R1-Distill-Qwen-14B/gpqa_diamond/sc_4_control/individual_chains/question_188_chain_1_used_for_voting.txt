Okay, so I have this question about crystallography, specifically about rhombohedral crystals. Hmm, I remember that rhombohedral crystals have all their edges equal and all their face angles equal, but the angles between the edges can be different. Oh wait, wait, in this case, the angles alpha, beta, gamma are all 30 degrees. So it's a rhombohedral crystal with angles of 30 each. The interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstroms. The question is about finding the interplanar distance for the (111) plane.

I think interplanar distance refers to the d-spacing, which is the distance between adjacent planes in a crystal lattice. The formula for calculating d-spacing is d = a / sqrt(h² + k² + l² - 2hk cos α - 2hl cos β - 2kl cos γ), where a is the lattice parameter, and hkl are the Miller indices. Wait, but wait, for a rhombohedral system, the lattice is a bit more complex because the angles aren't 90 degrees. Oh right, so the general formula for d-spacing in a rhombohedral crystal would involve the angles between the axes.

Wait, but in a rhombohedral crystal, the lattice is actually a special case of a hexagonal or something else? Or is it better to think of it as a cube that's been skewed. Right, a rhombohedron has all edges equal length (a) and all face angles equal (but not 90 degrees). So in this case, all a, b, c are equal to 10 Angstroms, because interatomic distance is given as 10. So a = b = c = 10 Angstroms.

The Miller indices are (111), so h=1, k=1, l=1. The formula for d-spacing in a general crystal is d = (a^2 (b^2 c^2 sin^2 α sin^2 β sin^2 γ + ... )) Wait, no, perhaps I'm mixing this up. Alternatively, I remember the formula for d-spacing in a rhombohedral system can be derived using the structure factor, but maybe a better approach is to use the general formula.

Wait, the general formula for d is 1/d² = (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) - (h k cos α)/(a²) - (h l cos β)/(a²) - (k l cos γ)/(a²). Oh, wait that might not be exactly right. Alternatively, I think the formula is 1/d² = (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) - (hk (cos α + cos β + cos γ))/(a²) ) ?

Wait, no, perhaps I should look up the correct formula. Alternatively, another approach is to use the volume of the unit cell and the relation to the d-spacing. Alternatively, I think the formula is:

d = a/(sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos α )) )

Wait, because in a rhombohedral crystal, the angles alpha, beta, gamma are all equal, so perhaps the formula simplifies. Wait, but wait, in a rhombohedral system, the angles between each pair of axes are the same, so alpha = beta = gamma = 30 degrees.

So let me plug in the numbers. Since all the angles are the same, the formula for 1/d² becomes:

1/d² = (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) - 2(hk + hl + kl) (cos α)/(a²)

Wait, I'm a bit confused because the formula might differ. Let me think again. The general formula for interplanar distance in a hexagonal or rhombohedral system can be written as:

d = (a) / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos α )

Wait, but wait, in a rhombohedral system, the angles between a, b, and c are all the same, so alpha, beta, gamma are all 30 degrees. So the formula would be:

1/d² = (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) - 2 (hk + hl + kl) (cos α)/(a²)

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is:

d = (a) / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - 2(hk cos α + hl cos β + kl cos γ) )

But in this case, alpha = beta = gamma = 30 degrees, so:

d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos α )

So let's compute this.

Given h=k=l=1, a=10 Angstroms, alpha=30 degrees.

Compute numerator: h² +k² + l² = 1 +1 +1 =3.

Compute the sum 2(hk + hl + kl) cos alpha: 2*(1*1 + 1*1 +1*1) * cos(30°)

cos(30) is sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660.

So 2*(3) * 0.8660 = 6 * 0.8660 = 5.196.

So the denominator inside the square root is 3 - 5.196 = -2.196. Wait, that can't be right because you can't take the square root of a negative number. That suggests I've made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, wait a minute, that's impossible. So perhaps I have the formula wrong. Hmm. Let me rethink.

Wait, perhaps the formula is 1/d² = (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) - 2(hk cos α + hl cos β + kl cos γ)/(a²). But when all angles are equal, let's say alpha=beta=gamma=θ.

Then,

1/d² = [ (h² + k² + l²) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos θ ] / a².

Wait, but if all the cos terms are the same, that would make the denominator (h² +k² + l²) - 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos θ.

Wait, but when h=k=l=1,

Numerator becomes (3) - 2*(3) * cos(30°).

So 3 - 6*(sqrt(3)/2) = 3 - 3*sqrt(3).

sqrt(3) is approximately 1.732, so 3*1.732 is about 5.196.

So 3 - 5.196 = -2.196. So 1/d² would be (-2.196)/a², which is negative. That's impossible because d² can't be negative.

Hmm, that's a problem. That suggests I have the formula wrong, because it's leading to a negative denominator.

Wait, perhaps the formula should have a plus sign instead of a minus? Because in a cubic system, the formula is d = a / sqrt(h² +k² + l²). But in a non-cubic system, perhaps the formula is modified. Let me double-check the formula.

Wait, another approach: The general formula for interplanar spacing in a crystal is given by:

1/d² = ( (h² +k² + l²) )/(a²) - (2 (hk cos α + hl cos β + kl cos γ) )/(a² )

Wait, but in our case, when alpha, beta, gamma are all 30 degrees, then:

1/d² = [ (3) - 2*(3 cos 30) ] / (10^2)

So substituting cos 30 ≈ 0.866,

3 - 2*3*0.866 = 3 - (6 * 0.866) = 3 - 5.196 = -2.196.

Which gives 1/d² = (-2.196)/100 = -0.02196, which is negative. That's impossible, so this can't be correct.

Hmm, that suggests that perhaps the formula has a different arrangement. Maybe I'm missing a component. Alternatively, maybe the formula is d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) - 2hk cos α - 2hl cos β - 2kl cos gamma )

Wait, perhaps that's the correct formula. Let's try that.

So for our case, (hkl)=(1,1,1), alpha=beta=gamma=30 degrees.

Compute the denominator inside the sqrt:

h² +k² +l² = 3.

Now, 2hk cos alpha = 2*1*1 * cos 30 = 2 * 0.866 ≈ 1.732.

Similarly, 2hl cos beta = same as above, 1.732.

And 2kl cos gamma = same, 1.732.

So the sum of these terms is 3*(1.732) ≈5.196.

So the denominator inside the sqrt is 3 - 5.196 = -2.196.

Again, negative. So that can't be right. Hmm.

Wait, but wait, maybe the formula is different for rhombohedral systems. Another thought: perhaps in a rhombohedral system, the formula is given by:

d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² + l²) - 2 (h k + h l +k l) cos α )

Wait, that's what I thought earlier. But that gives a negative. So perhaps I'm using the wrong formula.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the reciprocal lattice. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the volume of the unit cell and then use that to find d-spacing.

In a rhombohedral system, the volume V is a^3 * sqrt(1 - 3 cos alpha + 2 cos^3 alpha) ) / something? Wait, I think the volume of a rhombohedron is a^3 * sqrt(1 - 3 cos α + 3 cos^2 α) ) or something else? Wait, perhaps the formula is V = a^3 * sqrt(1 - 3 cos α + 2 cos^3 α). Wait, no, perhaps I should compute the volume using the scalar triple product.

The volume of the unit cell is given by the absolute value of the scalar triple product of the lattice vectors. So for a rhombohedron, the vectors are a along x, a along y but with some angle, and a along z with angles.

Hmm, perhaps the volume is a^3 * (1 - cos^2 α - cos^2 β - cos^2 γ + 2 cos α cos β cos γ) )^(1/2) ?

Wait, but when alpha = beta = gamma, that formula simplifies.

Alternatively, maybe the volume is V = a^3 * sqrt(1 - 3 cos^2 alpha + 2 cos^3 alpha) ) ?

I'm getting a bit stuck here, maybe I should try a different approach.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that in a rhombohedral system, the reciprocal lattice also has a specific form. The reciprocal lattice vectors are given by:

(1/a) (h, k, l) in a cubic system, but in a rhombohedral, they have to be adjusted for the angles.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to calculate the interplanar distance using the d-spacing formula for a general hexagonal system, but wait, rhombohedral is a subset of hexagonal when the angles are 60 degrees, but in this case, the angles are 30 degrees, so it's not hexagonal.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula for d-spacing in a general rhombohedral crystal. Here's what I found in my notes: the formula is d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² + l²) - 2 (hk cos α + hl cos β + kl cos gamma) )

Wait, but that's the same formula I tried earlier, leading to a negative denominator.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake with the signs in the formula. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is different. Maybe it's d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² + l²) - 2 (hk cos α + hl cos beta + kl cos gamma) + 2 (hk + hl + kl) ) )

No, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps in rhombohedral systems, the formula is different because all angles are the same.

Wait, another approach. Let me remember that for a cubic crystal with angles 90 degrees, the formula is d = a / sqrt(h² +k² +l²). So in this case, with angles 30 degrees, perhaps the formula has a correction factor.

Wait, perhaps the formula is d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² + l²) - 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos α )

Wait, that's what I thought earlier. Let me compute the denominator again.

h=k=l=1, so h² +k² +l² = 3.

hk =1, so 2(hk + hl + kl) = 2*(3) =6.

cos(alpha)=cos(30)=sqrt(3)/2≈0.866.

So 6 * 0.866 = 5.196.

So denominator inside sqrt is 3 -5.196= -2.196. Negative again.

Hmm, that can't be right. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the formula is d = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2 (hk + hl + kl) (1 - cos alpha) )

Wait, that's a different approach. Let me try that.

So with h=k=l=1,

h² +k² +l² =3.

2(hk + hl + kl)=6.

1 - cos alpha = 1 - sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 1 -0.866=0.134.

So 6 *0.134=0.804.

So denominator inside sqrt is 3 +0.804=3.804.

So sqrt(3.804)≈1.9507.

So d =10 /1.9507≈5.128 Angstrom. But that's not one of the options. The options are around 8.95 to 10.05. So that suggests this formula is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I should look for a different formula. I think I'm getting stuck because I'm not recalling the correct formula. Let me think again.

Another approach: The interplanar distance d for (hkl) plane is given by the formula:

d = (a) / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2(hk cos α + hl cos β + kl cos gamma) )

But if this leads to a negative under the square root, that suggests it's not possible, which can't be the case. So perhaps I'm using the wrong formula.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

d = (a) / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2 (hk + hl + kl) (1 - cos alpha) )

Wait, let's try that.

h=k=l=1, a=10.

h² +k² +l² =3.

2(hk + hl + kl)=6.

1 - cos alpha =1 - cos(30) ≈0.134.

So 6 *0.134≈0.804.

So denominator inside sqrt is 3 + 0.804=3.804.

sqrt(3.804)= approx 1.95.

So d=10/1.95≈5.128 Angstroms. But again, none of the options are near that.

Wait, perhaps the formula is written differently. Another thought: In a rhombohedral system, the angles between the axes are 30 degrees, but when calculating d-spacing, perhaps the formula uses cos(60) or something else. Alternatively, maybe I should use the reciprocal of the formula.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the unit cell is rhombohedral but the structure is such that the (111) planes are spaced differently.

Wait, another resource I found online says that the formula for d-spacing in a rhombohedral system is:

d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) - 2 (hk cos alpha + hl cos beta + kl cos gamma) )

So in our case, alpha=beta=gamma=30, h=k=l=1.

So,

d =10 / sqrt(3 - 2*(3 * cos 30°)).

Because 3 terms of (hk, etc.) each multiplied by cos 30°, and multiplied by 2.

So 3 * cos 30 ≈3 *0.866=2.598.

Multiply by 2: 5.196.

So denominator is 3 -5.196= -2.196. Hmm, negative again.

That's impossible, so perhaps I have the formula incorrect.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the angles. Wait, in a rhombohedral system, the angles are the angles between the edges. So perhaps the formula uses the angles between the planes, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2 (hk cos α + hl cos beta + kl cos gamma) )

Let me try that.

So, 3 + 2*(3 * 0.866) =3 + 5.196=8.196.

sqrt(8.196)= approx 2.863.

d=10/2.863= approx 3.494 Angstroms. Again, not matching the options.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think of another approach. Maybe the formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is given by d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2 (hk + hl + kl)(1 - cos alpha) )

Wait, let's compute that.

h^2 +k^2 +l^2=3.

hk +hl +kl=3.

1 - cos(30)=0.134.

So 2*(3)*0.134=0.804.

Denominator is 3 +0.804=3.804.

sqrt(3.804)=1.9507.

d=10/1.9507≈5.128. Again, not matching the options.

Am I making a mistake in the formula? Maybe I should double-check. Let me try to find the correct formula.

After searching, I found that the correct formula for the interplanar spacing in a rhombohedral crystal is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2 (hk cos α + hl cos β + kl cos γ) )

But when all angles are 30 degrees, this becomes:

d = a / sqrt(3 - 2*(3 cos 30°) )

=10 / sqrt(3 - 6*(sqrt(3)/2 ))

=10 / sqrt(3 - 3*sqrt(3)).

Compute 3*sqrt(3)=5.196.

3 -5.196= -2.196.

So sqrt(-2.196) is imaginary, which is impossible. So that suggests that for the (111) plane in this rhombohedral system, the d-spacing is imaginary, which isn't possible. That can't be right, so perhaps I'm using the wrong formula.

Wait, maybe the formula should have a plus sign instead. Let me try that.

d =a / sqrt( 3 +6*(sqrt(3)/2) )

=10 / sqrt(3 +5.196 )

=10 / sqrt(8.196) ≈10/2.863 ≈3.494.

But the options are much larger than this, so that's not matching.

Hmm, perhaps I should consider that the formula uses cos(60) instead of cos(30), but that would be wrong because alpha is 30 degrees.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm miscalculating the angles. Wait, another thought: in a rhombohedral system, the angles between the edges are 30 degrees, but perhaps the formula uses the supplementary angle, like 150 degrees, since the angle between vectors might be the external angle.

Wait, cos(150) is cos(180-30) = -cos(30) = -0.866.

So let's try that.

1/d² = [3 - 2*(3)* (-0.866) ] / (10^2)

= [3 + 2*3*0.866 ] /100

= [3 +5.196 ] /100

=8.196 /100 =0.08196.

So d = 1/sqrt(0.08196) ≈1/(0.286)≈3.494 Angstroms. Again, not matching the options.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Let me think about the options and see which one might make sense.

Options are approximately 9 Angstroms. The interatomic distance is 10, so the interplanar distance for (111) would be a bit smaller, but not by much. Alternatively, perhaps my approach is wrong, and I should compute the lattice parameter a in terms of interatomic distance.

Wait, wait, wait. The interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstroms. But in a rhombohedral crystal, the interatomic distance refers to the edge length 'a', so a=10 Angstroms.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the reciprocal of the structure factor. Another approach: the formula for the interplanar distance in a general crystal is given by:

d = (a^2 (b c sin α )) / ( sqrt( (b c sin α)^2 (h² +k² +l²) - (b c sin α)^2 (hk cos(α) + hl cos β + kl cos gamma) ) )

Wait, perhaps that's getting too complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the relation between the Miller indices and the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system.

Wait, another approach: The volume of the unit cell is V = a^3 * sqrt(1 - 3 cos^2 α + 2 cos^3 α) ) when all angles are equal to alpha.

But for alpha=30 degrees, cos^2(30) is 3/4, cos(30)=sqrt(3)/2.

So V = a^3 * sqrt(1 -3*(3/4) + 2*(sqrt(3)/2)^3 )

Compute each term:

3*(3/4) =9/4=2.25.

2*( (sqrt(3)/2)^3 ) = 2*(3*sqrt(3)/8 )= (6 sqrt(3))/8 )= (3 sqrt(3))/4 ≈ 3*1.732/4≈5.196/4≈1.299.

So 1 -2.25 +1.299 = (1 +1.299) -2.25 =2.299 -2.25=0.049.

So sqrt(0.049)= approx 0.221.

So V=10^3 *0.221=2210 Ang^3.

But I'm not sure how this helps find the interplanar distance.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for interplanar distance is d = a * (sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) ) )^{-1} ?

No, I don't think that's right.

Wait, perhaps I should use the Miller indices to find the interplanar distance using the formula from the Bragg's law.

Wait, another approach: The interplanar distance d is related to the atomic planes. For a rhombohedral system, the planes (hkl) are defined by the intercepts on the lattice vectors.

The formula for d is d = (a) / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos(alpha) )

Wait, let me try that.

h=k=l=1, alpha=30°, a=10.

So denominator inside sqrt:

3 + 2*(3)*0.866 =3 +5.196=8.196.

sqrt(8.196)= approx 2.863.

d=10/2.863≈3.494 Angstroms. Again, not matching the options.

This is getting frustrating. I'm clearly missing something about the correct formula. Let me try to find the correct formula for d-spacing in a rhombohedral system.

After thinking, I recall that the correct formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2(hk cos alpha + hl cos beta + kl cos gamma) )

But when all angles are 30, the denominator becomes negative, which is impossible. So perhaps the formula I'm using is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I should switch the signs. Let me try:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2 (hk cos alpha + hl cos beta + kl cos gamma) )

h=k=l=1,

denominator:3 + 2*(3*0.866) =3 +5.196=8.196.

d=10/sqrt(8.196)=10/2.863≈3.494. Again, not matching the options.

Hmm, perhaps I'm using the wrong approach. Another thought: Maybe the (111) planes are not possible for a rhombohedral system with alpha=30 degrees. But that doesn't seem right because Miller indices can be any integers.

Wait, perhaps the formula is d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2 (hk + hl + kl)(1 - cos alpha) )

Which would be 3 + 2*(3)(1 - 0.866) =3 + 2*3*0.134=3+0.804=3.804.

d=10/sqrt(3.804)=10/1.95≈5.13 Angstroms. Still not matching the options.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that in a rhombohedral system, the angles are 30 degrees, so the unit cell is compressed, leading to a larger d-spacing than the cubic case.

Wait, if in a cubic system, a=10, (111) plane has d=10/sqrt(3)=5.77 Angstroms. But in this case, with angles 30, perhaps the d-spacing is larger because the planes are more spread out.

Wait, but according to the formulas I tried, the d-spacing was either negative or around 3-5 Angstroms, which is smaller than the cubic case. But the options are around 9 Angstroms, which is larger than 10.

Wait, perhaps the formula I'm using is incorrect, and I'm supposed to calculate something else. Another thought: Perhaps the question refers to the interplanar distance, which is the same as the interatomic distance in a simple cubic structure. But that's not the case here.

Wait, perhaps the question is actually about the distance between adjacent (111) planes, which in a cubic structure would be d = a / sqrt(3). With a=10, that's about 5.77. But the options are much higher.

Wait, this is confusing. I'm probably making a mistake in the formula. Let me try to find another approach.

Another approach: The structure factor in a rhombohedral system is given by:

F(hkl) = (a^2/(h^2 +k^2 +l^2)) ) * [ (h^2 +k^2 +l^2 - 2(hk cos α + hl cos β + kl cos gamma) ) ]^(1/2)

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos alpha )

Wait, if I try that,

h=k=l=1, alpha=30.

Denominator:3 - 2*(3)*0.866=3-5.196=-2.196.

Again negative. So that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps the formula should be d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2 (hk + hl + kl) (1 - cos alpha) )

Which gives,

3 + 2*(3)*(1-0.866)=3 + 6*(0.134)=3 +0.804=3.804.

d=10/√3.804≈5.13. Again, not matching.

Hmm, perhaps the problem lies in how the interatomic distance is defined. Wait, the question states that the interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms. Does that correspond to the lattice parameter a, or is the lattice parameter something else?

Wait, in a rhombohedral system, the interatomic distance along the a-axis is 'a', but the interatomic distance in other directions would be different. Wait, but the problem says interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms. So perhaps a=10.

So I think my previous approach was correct but I’m missing something in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula is d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2 (hk + hl + kl) (cos alpha -1) )

Wait, cos(30) is 0.866, so cos alpha -1 =-0.134.

So denominator becomes 3 - 2*(3)* (-0.134 )=3 + 0.804=3.804.

So sqrt(3.804)=1.95.

d=10/1.95≈5.128. Still not matching.

I think I'm stuck. Maybe I should consider that the formula uses the reciprocal of the Miller indices, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, the options are all around 9 Angstroms, which is close to the given interatomic distance of 10. Could the interplanar distance be larger than a? That doesn't make sense because the interplanar distance is the distance between adjacent planes, which should be less than the lattice parameter in most cases.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the formula is d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos (180 - alpha) )

Because 180-30=150, cos(150)= -0.866.

So,

Denominator=3 - 2*(3)*(-0.866)=3+5.196=8.196.

sqrt(8.196)=2.863.

d=10/2.863≈3.494.

Again, not matching.

Hmm, perhaps I should just proceed with the initial formula despite the negative value, but that can't be right. Alternatively, perhaps I'm using the reciprocal formula.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

d = (a) / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos(180 - alpha) )

Which would be,

3 + 2*(3)*(-0.866)=3-5.196=-2.196.

Again negative.

I'm really stuck here. Since all my approaches are leading to d-spacings not matching the options, perhaps I should try to think differently.

Wait, maybe the formula is:

d = (a) / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2 (hk + hl + kl) (1 + cos alpha) )

Let me compute that.

h=k=l=1.

Denominator=3 + 2*(3)*(1 +0.866)=3+6*(1.866)=3 + 11.196=14.196.

sqrt(14.196)=3.769.

d=10/3.769≈2.653. Not matching.

Hmm, I'm clearly missing something here. Another approach: Perhaps the formula for d-spacing in a rhombohedral system is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2 (hk + hl + kl) (1 - cos alpha) )

Wait,

Denominator=3 + 2*(3)*(1 - 0.866)=3 + 6*(0.134)=3 +0.804=3.804.

d=10/1.95≈5.128.

Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the reciprocal of the formula. Let me think: if I take 1/d, maybe I'm getting that the interplanar distance is larger than a, but that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos (alpha) )

But as before, that gives a negative denominator.

So perhaps the correct approach is to use the formula but take the absolute value of the denominator, which would give a real number.

So,

d=10 / sqrt( |3 -5.196| )=10/sqrt(2.196)=10/1.481≈6.76 Angstroms. Still not matching.

Wait, but the options are 8.95, which is about 10 * sqrt(3/4) → sqrt(3/4)=0.866, so 10*0.866≈8.66. Hmm, close to option B (8.95). But how?

Wait, perhaps the formula is d = a * sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) ) / sqrt( something else ), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is d = a / sqrt( h² +k² + l² ), but that only applies to cubic systems. For cubic, (111) would be 10/sqrt(3)=5.77. But the options are higher.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for the face-centered cubic system is being confused here, but that's not a rhombohedral system.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the angles. Let's think again: in a rhombohedral system, the angles between the axes are alpha, beta, gamma, which are all 30 degrees in this case. So when calculating the d-spacing, the formula should take that into account.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) + 2 (hk + hl + kl) (1 - cos alpha) )

Which gives:

3 + 2*(3)(1-0.866)=3 + 6*(0.134)=3 + 0.804=3.804.

sqrt(3.804)=1.9507.

d=10/1.9507≈5.128. Not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the inverse of the denominator.

Wait, perhaps the formula is d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2 (hk + hl + kl) (1 - cos alpha) )

Which would be:

3 - 2*(3)*(1 -0.866) =3 - 6*(0.134)=3-0.804=2.196.

sqrt(2.196)=1.481.

d=10/1.481≈6.76 Angstroms. Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps the formula is d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) - 2 (hk + hl + kl) (1 - cos alpha) )

Which would be 3 -6*(0.134)=3-0.804=2.196.

sqrt(2.196)=1.481 → d=10/1.481≈6.76. Still not matching.

Hmm. Maybe I should try to compute based on the unit cell vectors.

The unit cell vectors are a, b, c, each of length 10 Angstroms. The angles between each pair are 30 degrees.

The vector along the (111) plane would be a + b + c.

The distance between the origin and the point (1,1,1) is sqrt(a^2 +b^2 +c^2 + 2ab cos gamma + 2ac cos beta + 2 bc cos alpha )

Wait, but for a rhombohedral system, a=b=c=10, and all angles between vectors are 30 degrees.

So the distance is sqrt(10^2 +10^2 +10^2 + 2*10*10 cos30 + 2*10*10 cos30 + 2*10*10 cos30 )

= sqrt(300 + 2*100*(0.866)*3 )

Wait, 2*100=200. 200 *0.866=173.2.

So 300 +3*173.2=300+519.6=819.6.

sqrt(819.6)= approx 28.63 Angstrom.

The interplanar distance d is the distance between (000) and (111) divided by the square root of (h² +k² +l²). Wait, no, perhaps that's not the right approach.

Alternatively, the interplanar distance is the distance between two adjacent planes, which is the distance between (000) and (111) divided by the norm of the reciprocal lattice vector.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating again. Alternatively, the distance between the planes is the length of the vector (a +b +c) divided by the square root of (h² +k² +l²). So in this case, d = |a +b +c| / sqrt(3).

Which would be 28.63 / 1.732≈16.53. But that's way larger than the options.

Hmm, I'm clearly stuck. Since I can't find a way to get the options' numbers, perhaps the correct approach is to compute d as a multiplied by something else.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the formula is d = a * sqrt( (1 + 2 cos alpha) ) / sqrt(3).

With alpha=30°, cos(30)=0.866.

So sqrt(1 + 2*0.866)=sqrt(1+1.732)=sqrt(2.732)=1.652.

Then d=10 *1.652 /1.732≈10*0.954≈9.54 Angstroms. That's option C.

Wait, that makes sense. So I think this is the way.

Let me check:

d= a * sqrt(1 + 2 cos α) / sqrt(3)

=10 * sqrt(1 + 2*(0.866)) /1.732

=10 * sqrt(2.732) /1.732

sqrt(2.732)=1.652.

So 10 *1.652=16.52. Divided by 1.732 gives ≈9.54 Angstroms. Which matches option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the interplanar distance \( d \) for the (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal with interatomic distance \( a = 10 \, \text{Å} \) and angles \( \alpha = \beta = \gamma = 30^\circ \), the formula for \( d \)-spacing in a rhombohedral system is:

\[
d = \frac{a}{\sqrt{h^2 + k^2 + l^2 - 2(hk \cos \alpha + hl \cos \beta + kl \cos \gamma)}}
\]

### Step 1: Substituting the given values
- \( h = k = l = 1 \)
- \( \alpha = \beta = \gamma = 30^\circ \), so \( \cos 30^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \approx 0.866 \)
- \( a = 10 \, \text{Å} \)

The denominator becomes:

\[
h^2 + k^2 + l^2 - 2(hk \cos \alpha + hl \cos \beta + kl \cos \gamma)
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
3 - 2(3 \cdot 0.866) = 3 - 5.196 = -2.196
\]

This results in a negative value under the square root, which is unphysical. This suggests the standard formula may not directly apply in this case.

### Step 2: Alternative approach
For rhombohedral systems, the interplanar distance can also be expressed as:

\[
d = a \cdot \frac{\sqrt{1 + 2 \cos \alpha}}{\sqrt{3}}
\]

Substituting \( a = 10 \, \text{Å} \) and \( \cos 30^\circ = 0.866 \):

\[
d = 10 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{1 + 2 \cdot 0.866}}{\sqrt{3}}
\]

First, calculate the numerator inside the square root:

\[
1 + 2 \cdot 0.866 = 1 + 1.732 = 2.732
\]

\[
\sqrt{2.732} \approx 1.652
\]

Now, divide by \( \sqrt{3} \approx 1.732 \):

\[
\frac{1.652}{1.732} \approx 0.954
\]

Finally, multiply by \( a = 10 \, \text{Å} \):

\[
d \approx 10 \cdot 0.954 = 9.54 \, \text{Å}
\]

### Step 3: Matching the options
The calculated interplanar distance \( d \approx 9.54 \, \text{Å} \) matches option **C**.
