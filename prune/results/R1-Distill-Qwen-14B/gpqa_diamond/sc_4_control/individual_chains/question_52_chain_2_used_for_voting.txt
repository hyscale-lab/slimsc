Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this astronomy problem. Let me read it carefully.

The question is about a star whose surface is sometimes covered by dark spots. When there are no spots, the effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. When 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. The problem is about the ratio of neutral Titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels. Without spots, the ratio is higher, but when spots are present, the ratio decreases. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes.

Hmm, I remember that in stellar atmospheres under LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), the population of energy levels can be described by the Boltzmann equation. The ratio of populations between two energy levels depends on the temperature and the energy difference between the levels.

The Boltzmann equation says that the ratio of populations (n2/n1) is equal to (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2-E1)/(k*T) ), where g is the statistical weight, E is the energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

In this problem, the transition corresponds to a wavelength of 1448 Å. Wait, that's in the ultraviolet range. I think the energy difference can be found using the relation E = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant and c is speed of light.

So first, calculate the energy difference between the two levels. Let me recall the constants:

h = 6.626e-34 J·s
c = 3e8 m/s
λ = 1448 Å = 1.448e-7 meters.

E = hc/λ = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / 1.448e-7.

Let me compute that. 6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25. Divided by 1.448e-7 gives approximately 1.373e-18 J per photon.

Wait, but I might need this in terms of eV because atomic energy levels are often expressed in electron volts. 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J, so E = 1.373e-18 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 8.57 eV.

Wait, that seems high. Hmm, maybe I should check the calculation again.

Wait, 1.373e-18 J is (1.373e-18) / (1.602e-19 eV) ) ≈ 8.57 eV. Yes, that's correct.

Now, the Boltzmann factor is exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), where ΔE is E2-E1. Assuming the two levels have a transition corresponding to this photon, so ΔE is 8.57 eV.

Wait, but wait. Wait, the Boltzmann equation uses the energy difference divided by (k*T). So let's compute ΔE/(k T) for each temperature.

But wait, k is Boltzmann's constant, which is 8.617e-5 eV/K. So k*T is 8.617e-5 * T.

So for each temperature, T1 = 6000 K (no spots) and T2 = 5500 K (spots).

Compute ΔE/(k T) for both cases.

First, T1 = 6000 K:

k*T1 = 8.617e-5 * 6000 = 0.51702 eV.

ΔE = 8.57 eV.

So x1 = ΔE/(k T1) = 8.57 / 0.51702 ≈ 16.576.

Similarly for T2 =5500 K:

k*T2 = 8.617e-5 *5500 ≈ 0.473935 eV.

x2 = 8.57 / 0.473935 ≈ 18.099.

Wait, that can't be right. Because when temperature decreases, the exponent becomes smaller (since denominator is smaller), but wait, the exponent is (E2 - E1)/(k T), and if E2 > E1, then higher T makes the exponent smaller. Wait, but the ratio is n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) ). So when T decreases, the exponent becomes more negative, so the ratio decreases.

Wait, but the question says that when spots are present (Teff=5500 K), the ratio of n1/n2 (or wait, the ratio is n_level1 / n_level2? Or is it level 2 over level 1? Wait, the question says the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energetic levels (level 1 and level 2). It's observed that this ratio decreases when the star has spots.

Wait, the ratio is, say, n1/n2. When spots are present, n1/n2 is lower. Wait, or is it the other way around?

Wait, the problem says "the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energetic levels (level 1 and level 2), astronomers have observed that this ratio decreases when the star has spots."

So without spots, ratio is higher. So when Teff is higher, the ratio is higher. So the ratio is n1/n2, because higher T would cause more excitation (more in higher levels), so n2 increases relative to n1, so n1/n2 decreases. Wait, let me think.

Wait, the ratio is (n1)/(n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( (E1 - E2)/(k T) ). Because the Boltzmann equation is:

n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

So, n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

Wait, that would mean that as T increases, (E2 - E1)/(k T) increases, so exp increases. So n1/n2 increases with temperature. So if when spots are present, the ratio decreases, that implies that when the star has spots (lower Teff), n1/n2 is lower. So that aligns with what's stated in the problem.

So our ratio is n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

But wait, the problem doesn't give us the statistical weights (g1 and g2), so I think they must cancel out, or maybe they are the same? The problem doesn't specify, but in the options, the ratio is given, so perhaps the ratio is taken as n1/n2, assuming g1/g2 is a constant, which would be accounted for in the ratio.

Wait, but the problem is about the ratio when the star has spots versus when it doesn't. So the factor is (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_with_spots.

Which would be [ (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k T1) ) ] / [ (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k T2) ) ]

The g1/g2 terms cancel, so the factor is exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T1) - (E2 - E1)/(k T2) )

Which is exp( (E2 - E1) [ 1/(k T1) - 1/(k T2) ] )

Wait, but wait, let me think again. The factor is (n1/n2)_T1 / (n1/n2)_T2.

Which is [ exp( (E2-E1)/(k T1) ) ] / [ exp( (E2-E1)/(k T2) ) ]

Which is exp( (E2-E1)/(k T1) - (E2-E1)/(k T2) )

Which is exp( (E2-E1)/(k) [ 1/T1 - 1/T2 ] )

So plugging in the values:

E2-E1 = 8.57 eV.

k is 8.617e-5 eV/K.

Compute exponent: (8.57) / (8.617e-5) [ 1/6000 - 1/5500 ]

Wait, let's compute that step by step.

First, calculate 1/6000 = 1.6667e-4 and 1/5500 ≈1.8182e-4.

Difference: 1.6667e-4 -1.8182e-4 = -1.515e-5.

Multiply by (8.57)/(8.617e-5):

(8.57) / (8.617e-5) = approx 8.57 / 0.00008617 ≈ approx 100,000 something. Let me compute it exactly.

8.57 / 8.617e-5 = 8.57 / (8.617 * 1e-5) ) = 8.57 /8.617 * 1e5.

8.57 /8.617 ≈ approx 0.9945.

So 0.9945 * 1e5 = ~99450.

So the exponent is 99450 * (-1.515e-5) = 99450 * (-0.00001515) 

Compute 99450 * 0.00001515:

99450 * 0.00001 = 0.9945

99450 * 0.00000515 = 99450 * 5.15e-6 ≈ 99450 *5.15e-6.

Compute 99450 *5e-6 = 0.49725, and 99450 *0.00000015= approx 0.0149175.

So ≈ 0.49725 + 0.0149175 = 0.5121675.

So total is 0.9945 + 0.5121675 ≈ 1.5067, but since it's negative, it's -1.5067.

So the exponent is approximately -1.5067.

So the factor is exp(-1.5067) ≈ e^(-1.5067).

What's e^-1.5? About 0.223. Since 1.5067 is a bit more than 1.5, maybe around 0.22.

Wait wait, wait, no. Wait, our exponent was -1.5067, so the factor is exp(-1.5067) ≈ 1 / exp(1.5067).

What's exp(1.5)? e^1 is about 2.718, e^0.5 is about 1.648, so e^1.5 ≈ 4.4817.

So exp(1.5067) is approximately 4.51, so 1/4.51 ≈ 0.2217.

Wait, but wait, the factor we're computing is (n1/n2)_T1 / (n1/n2)_T2.

Which is the factor by which the ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots (T1) compared to when it has spots (T2).

So the ratio without spots is higher than with spots. So the factor is (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_spots = 0.2217.

Wait, wait, that would mean the ratio without spots is 0.2217 times the ratio with spots. But the problem says that the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So if the ratio is n1/n2, when T decreases (spots present), the ratio decreases. So without spots, the ratio is higher, so (n1/n2)_no_spots is higher than (n1/n2)_spots.

So the factor is (higher)/(lower) = 1/0.2217 ≈4.51.

Wait, wait, no, no. Wait, the factor is (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_spots = exp( (E2-E1)/(k T1) - (E2-E1)/(k T2) ).

Which we calculated as 0.2217. So the ratio without spots is 0.2217 times the ratio with spots. So the ratio decreases by a factor of ~4.51.

Wait, because 0.2217 is approximately 1/4.51. So the ratio without spots is (1/4.51) times the ratio with spots. So the ratio is lower when spots are present. So the ratio when no spots is 0.2217 times the ratio when spots, so the factor is (no spots)/(spots) = 0.2217, which is about 1/4.51, so the ratio decreases by a factor of about 4.5.

But wait, the options have option C as ~4.5, and option D as ~2.9.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let's re-express:

The ratio when no spots is R1 = n1/n2 at T1.

The ratio when spots is R2 = n1/n2 at T2.

We found that R1/R2 = exp( (E2-E1)/k [ 1/T1 - 1/T2 ] )

Which is exp( (8.57 eV)/(8.617e-5 eV/K) [ 1/6000 - 1/5500 ] )

Ah wait, I think I might have miscalculated the exponent. Let me recompute the exponent more accurately.

Wait, let's compute 1/6000 - 1/5500:

1/6000 = 0.000166667

1/5500 ≈ 0.000181818

Difference: 0.000166667 - 0.000181818 = -0.000015151.

So (E2-E1)/(k) = 8.57 eV / 8.617e-5 eV/K = 8.57 / 0.00008617 ≈ 100,000 something.

Compute 8.57 / 0.00008617 ≈ let's calculate it:

0.00008617 = 8.617e-5.

8.57 / 8.617e-5 = (8.57 /8.617) * 1e5 ≈ (0.9945) * 1e5 = 99,450.

So 99,450 * (-0.000015151) = ?

99,450 * (-0.000015151) = - (99,450 * 0.000015151).

Compute 99,450 * 0.000015 = 99,450 *1.5e-5 = 1.49175.

And 99,450 * 0.00000015151 = approx 99,450 * 1.5151e-7 ≈ approx 0.01506.

So total is approx 1.49175 + 0.01506 ≈ 1.5068. So the product is -1.5068.

So exponent is -1.5068.

e^-1.5068 ≈ ?

We know that e^-1.6 is about 0.2019.

e^-1.5 is about 0.2231.

At 1.5068, which is very close to 1.5, so e^-1.5068 ≈ 0.222.

Wait, that's approximately 0.222.

So R1/R2 = 0.222.

Wait, but wait. R1 is (n1/n2) at 6000 K, R2 is (n1/n2) at 5500 K.

Because when spots are present, the effective temperature is lower, so R2 < R1.

So the factor by which R1 is larger than R2 is R1/R2 = 1/ (R2/R1) = 1/0.222 ≈4.5.

So the ratio without spots is 4.5 times higher than when spots are present. So the factor is ~4.5, which is option C.

Wait, but I thought the factor was R1/R2, which is 0.222. But that would mean R1 is 0.222 * R2, which can't be because when temperature increases, R1 should be higher. Wait, no, I'm getting confused.

Wait, let me clarify:

n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) )

At higher T (no spots), (E2-E1)/(k T) is lower, so the exponent is smaller. So the exponent is less negative, so the exponential is larger. So n1/n2 is larger at higher T.

So R1 (no spots) is larger than R2 (spots).

So R1/R2 is (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_spots = [exp( (E2-E1)/(k T1) ) ] / [ exp( (E2-E1)/(k T2) ) ].

Which is exp[ (E2-E1)/(k) (1/T1 - 1/T2) ) ].

Which we found to be exp( -1.5068 ) ≈ 0.222.

Wait, that would mean R1 is 0.222 times R2. So R1 < R2? But that can't be right because higher T should have a higher R1.

Wait, I think I messed up the calculation earlier.

Wait, (E2 - E1) is positive because E2 is higher. So (E2-E1)/(k T) is positive. So the exponent is positive.

Wait, wait, let me re-express the exponent.

Wait, the exponent is (E2-E1)/(k T) = (8.57 eV) / (8.617e-5 eV/K * T).

So for T1=6000 K, it's 8.57/(8.617e-5 *6000) = 8.57/(0.51702) ≈ 16.58.

Similarly for T2=5500 K: 8.57/(8.617e-5 *5500) ≈ 8.57/(0.4739) ≈ 18.09.

So the exponent for R1 is 16.58, and for R2 is 18.09.

So R1 = exp(16.58), R2 = exp(18.09).

Wait, no, wait. No, R1 is (n1/n2) at T1, which is exp( (E2-E1)/(k T1) ), which is exp(16.58), which is a big number. Similarly R2 is exp(18.09), which is even bigger.

Wait, that can't be right because with higher T, the ratio R1 should be higher.

Wait, wait, perhaps I have the ratio inverted. Because the Boltzmann factor for n1/n2 is exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) ). So as T increases, this exponent increases, so n1/n2 increases.

But wait, when T is higher, the thermal energy is higher, so more atoms are in the higher energy level (E2). So n2 increases. So n1/n2 should decrease. Wait, that contradicts.

Wait, wait, no. Let's think again.

n2/n1 = (g2/g1) exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) )

So if E2 > E1, then -(E2-E1) is negative. So n2/n1 is proportional to exp( negative value ), which decreases with increasing T.

So at higher T, n2/n1 is smaller, meaning more atoms are in level 1, so n1/n2 is larger. So yes, R1 (n1/n2) is larger at higher T.

But when T increases, the exponent (E2-E1)/(k T) is smaller, so exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) ) is smaller because the exponent is positive but smaller. Wait, no. Let me think.

Wait, (E2-E1)/(k T) is positive. So as T increases, this becomes smaller, meaning the exponent is less, so exp( it ) is smaller. So R1 = exp( (E2-E1)/(k T1) ) would be larger than exp( (E2-E1)/(k T2) ), because T1 < T2.

Wait, no, T1=6000, T2=5500. So T1 is higher than T2?

Wait, no. Wait, when the star has no spots, T_eff is 6000 K (T1=6000), and when spots are present, T_eff drops to 5500 K (T2=5500). So T1 > T2.

So (E2-E1)/(k T1) is 8.57/(8.617e-5 *6000) ≈ 16.58, as before.

(E2-E1)/(k T2) is 8.57/(8.617e-5 *5500) ≈ 18.09.

So the exponent for R1 (no spots) is 16.58, and R2 (spots) is 18.09.

So R1 = exp(16.58) and R2= exp(18.09).

So R1/R2 = exp(16.58) / exp(18.09) )= exp(16.58-18.09) = exp(-1.51).

Which is exp(-1.51) ≈ 0.2207.

So the ratio R1 is 0.2207 times R2. So R1 is about 22% of R2. Wait, that can't be. Because when T is higher (no spots), R1 should be higher than R2. But according to this, R1 is lower. That contradicts.

Wait, no, perhaps I got the ratio backwards. Let me make sure.

Wait, the ratio given is the ratio of n1/n2. So when T increases, n1/n2 increases because more atoms are in level 1 compared to level 2. Because higher T makes more thermal excitation, so more atoms move to higher energy levels, so n2 increases, but if the ratio is n1/n2, then that ratio decreases. Wait, no.

Wait, let me think very carefully.

If E2 > E1, then for a given atom, the energy is higher in E2. At higher T, more atoms are in higher energy levels (because thermal energy can overcome the energy difference). So n2 increases.

So n2/n1 increases with T, meaning n1/n2 decreases with T.

So when T increases (no spots), n1/n2 decreases.

But the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. Wait, without spots, Teff is higher (6000), so n1/n2 is lower. But the problem states that when the star has spots (lower Teff), the ratio of n1/n2 decreases. Which would imply that without spots, the ratio is higher than when spots are present. But according to what I just thought, no, higher T would lead to a lower n1/n2.

Wait, perhaps I have this inverted. Let me think again.

n2 is the number of atoms in level 2. n1 is the number in level 1.

At higher T, more atoms are in level 2 because the thermal energy is sufficient to excite them. So n2 increases, n1 decreases. So n1/n2 would decrease as T increases.

So without spots, T is higher, so n1/n2 is lower than when spots are present (lower T).

But according to the problem statement, when the star has spots, the ratio of n1/n2 decreases. Which would mean that without spots, the ratio is higher.

Wait, but that would imply that higher T leads to higher n1/n2, which contradicts my earlier understanding. Hmm, I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio the problem is referring to is n2/n1. Let me re-examine the question.

Question: "the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energetic levels (level 1 and level 2), astronomers have observed that this ratio decreases when the star has spots."

Wait, the ratio could be n2/n1. So when the star has spots (lower T), this ratio decreases. So n2/n1 would be higher at higher T.

Which makes sense, because higher T means more excitation, more in level 2, so n2/n1 increases.

So if the ratio being referred to is n2/n1, then when T increases (no spots), n2/n1 increases.

So the factor would be (n2/n1)_no_spots / (n2/n1)_spots.

Which is [ (g2/g1) exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T1) ) ] / [ (g2/g1) exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T2) ) ]

The g2/g1 terms cancel. So the factor is exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T1) + (E2-E1)/(k T2) )

Which is exp( (E2-E1)/(k) [ (-1/T1) + (1/T2) ] )

Which is same as exp( (E2-E1)/(k) [ (1/T2) - (1/T1) ] )

So plugging in the numbers:

(E2-E1)/(k) is 8.57 / 8.617e-5 ≈ 99,450.

Compute (1/T2 - 1/T1) = (1/5500 - 1/6000) = (0.0001818 - 0.00016667) ≈ 0.00001513.

So multiply 99,450 * 0.00001513 ≈ 1.505.

So exponent is 1.505.

So exp(1.505) ≈ e^1.505 ≈ 4.495.

So the factor is approximately 4.5.

Which matches option C.

So the ratio n2/n1 without spots is 4.5 times that when spots are present.

Wait, but the question says the ratio decreases when spots are present. Which would mean that when there are no spots, the ratio is higher. So the factor is approximately 4.5.

Looking back at the options, option C is ~4.5.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the factor by which the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots, we use the Boltzmann equation under the assumption of Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). The ratio of populations between two energy levels is given by:

\[
\frac{n_2}{n_1} = \frac{g_2}{g_1} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT}\right),
\]

where \(g_1\) and \(g_2\) are the statistical weights of the levels, \(\Delta E = E_2 - E_1\) is the energy difference between the levels, \(k\) is Boltzmann's constant, and \(T\) is the effective temperature.

The problem specifies that the transition corresponds to a wavelength of \(\lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å}\), so the energy difference is calculated using:

\[
\Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda},
\]

where \(h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}\) is Planck's constant and \(c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}\) is the speed of light. Substituting \(\lambda = 1.448 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m}\), we find:

\[
\Delta E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3 \times 10^8)}{1.448 \times 10^{-7}} \approx 1.373 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J}.
\]

Converting to electron volts (\(1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}\)):

\[
\Delta E \approx \frac{1.373 \times 10^{-18}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 8.57 \, \text{eV}.
\]

Next, we calculate the Boltzmann factor for the two temperatures: \(T_1 = 6000 \, \text{K}\) (no spots) and \(T_2 = 5500 \, \text{K}\) (spots). The Boltzmann constant in eV/K is \(k = 8.617 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{eV/K}\). For each temperature, the term \(-\Delta E / (kT)\) is:

\[
\text{For } T_1 = 6000 \, \text{K}: \quad -\frac{\Delta E}{kT_1} = -\frac{8.57}{(8.617 \times 10^{-5})(6000)} \approx -16.58,
\]
\[
\text{For } T_2 = 5500 \, \text{K}: \quad -\frac{\Delta E}{kT_2} = -\frac{8.57}{(8.617 \times 10^{-5})(5500)} \approx -18.09.
\]

The ratio of populations is proportional to the exponential of these terms. The factor by which the ratio changes is:

\[
\frac{\left(\frac{n_2}{n_1}\right)_{T_1}}{\left(\frac{n_2}{n_1}\right)_{T_2}} = \frac{\exp(-\Delta E / (kT_1))}{\exp(-\Delta E / (kT_2))} = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right).
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} = \frac{1}{5500} - \frac{1}{6000} \approx 0.0001818 - 0.0001667 = 0.0000151,
\]
\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} = \frac{8.57}{8.617 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 99,450.
\]

Thus, the exponent becomes:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right) \approx 99,450 \times 0.0000151 \approx 1.505.
\]

Finally, the factor is:

\[
\exp(1.505) \approx 4.5.
\]

This means the ratio of the number of Ti atoms in the two energy levels is approximately 4.5 times higher when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots. This matches option **C**.

Answer: C
