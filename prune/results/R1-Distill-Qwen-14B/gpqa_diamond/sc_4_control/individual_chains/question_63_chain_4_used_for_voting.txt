Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem about diatomic molecules and their energy states. Hmm, I remember that molecules can be modeled using rotation and vibration models. The question is about the quantum rotation-vibration model, also known as the non-rigid rotor model. 

The molecule is in its fundamental state. Wait, the fundamental state is the lowest energy state, right? So the ground state. The question is asking what momentum a photon should have so that when it's absorbed, the molecule transitions to the next lowest energy state. That next state would be the first excited state.

I think the molecule's energy levels are quantized. For a diatomic, the energy levels probably involve both rotational and vibrational contributions. But wait, when a photon is absorbed, it's usually causing a transition in either the vibrational or rotational state. But this is a rotation-vibration model, so perhaps it's a combination.

Wait, the question says the molecule is in the fundamental state. The fundamental vibrational state is n=0, I think. Then, the next state would be n=1 in vibration. But wait, the question says the next state with the lowest possible energy. Oh, maybe it's a transition that changes the rotational state as well. Hmm, but I might be getting confused.

Wait, in the rotation-vibration model, the energy levels are given by a combination of rotational and vibrational terms. But the fundamental state would have the lowest vibrational state (n=0) and the lowest rotational state (like J=0 or J=1, depending on the model). Wait, no—wait, for a rigid rotor, the rotational states are quantized with J being the rotational quantum number. But since this is a non-rigid rotor model, perhaps it's not just a simple rotor but includes some vibration as well.

Wait, maybe the molecule's energy levels are such that the fundamental state is when both rotation and vibration are at their lowest. So, perhaps n=0 (vibrational) and J=0 (rotational). Then, the next state would be either increasing J or n. But which transition is allowed? Because in photon absorption, you can have transitions that change either the vibrational state or the rotational state, depending on the selection rules.

In the rigid rotor model, the selection rule for rotational transitions is ΔJ = ±1. But since this is a non-rigid rotor, perhaps the molecule's bond length can change, so maybe it's more like a vibration-rotation model where both are considered together.

Wait, the problem asks for the photon's momentum. Momentum of a photon is p = h/λ, but since E=pc for photons, and E=hf, so p = h f / c. But wait, I'm not sure if I'm mixing concepts correctly here.

Alternatively, the energy of the photon must match the energy difference between the two states. So I need to find the energy difference between the fundamental state and the next possible state (the lowest higher energy state).

But what's the energy of the fundamental state? The fundamental state is the lowest energy, which in the vibration-rotation model would be the combination of the lowest vibrational state (n=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0 or J=1? I'm not certain). Wait, for a diatomic molecule, the rotational quantum number J can be 0,1,2,... and for each J, there are (2J+1) states. But in the rigid rotor model, the rotational energy is (ħ² J (J+1))/(2I), where I is the moment of inertia.

But considering the rotation-vibration coupling, perhaps the energy levels are given by the equation:

E = E_vibrational(n) + E_rotational(J)

Where E_vibrational(n) is the vibrational energy level, which is (n + 1/2) h w, and E_rotational(J) is (J (J+1) ħ²) / (2I).

Wait, but in the non-rigid rotor model, the bond length isn't fixed because the molecule is vibrating. So, perhaps the rotational energy depends on the vibrational state. But maybe for the purpose of this problem, we can treat them as separate, or perhaps the question is focusing only on the vibrational transition.

Wait, the question says the molecule is in its fundamental state. If the fundamental state is n=0 for vibration and J=0 for rotation, then the next state could be either n=1 (vibrational) or J=1 (rotational). But which transition requires less energy? Because the photon's energy must match the energy difference.

Wait, let's compute the energy differences for both transitions.

The vibrational energy difference between n=0 and n=1 is ΔE_vibrational = h w.

The rotational energy difference between J=0 and J=1 can be found using E_rot(J). Let me compute that. The difference would be E_rot(J=1) - E_rot(J=0) = [ (1*(1+1) ) - (0*(0+1)) ] * (ħ²)/(2I) ) = [2 -0 ] * ħ²/(2I) )= (2)(ħ²/(2I)) = ħ²/(I).

Wait, but which transition is needed here? The problem says the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the photon should supply the energy for the smallest possible jump. So maybe the rotational transition requires less energy than the vibrational?

Alternatively, maybe the molecule is in the ground vibrational state (n=0) but in the lowest rotational state. So the next energy state could be either a higher vibrational state or a higher rotational state. But the question is about the next state with the lowest energy. So which is lower in energy: the first rotational state or the first vibrational state.

Wait, but for most diatomic molecules, the vibrational energy levels are much more widely spaced than the rotational ones. Because the vibrational energy levels have spacing of h w, which is on the order of eV (for typical w in 1e14 Hz), while rotational energy spacing is much smaller, typically in microwave regions.

So for example, if w is 4e14 rad/s (given in the problem), then the vibrational energy spacing is about h * w. Let me compute that.

h is Planck's constant, 6.626e-34 J·s.

w is 4e14 rad/s. So h*w = 6.626e-34 * 4e14 = 2.65e-19 J.

That's about 1.66 eV (since 1 eV is ~1.6e-19 J). So that's a significant energy difference.

On the other hand, the rotational energy difference between J=0 and J=1: E_rot(J=1) - E_rot(J=0) = (ħ² (2) )/(2I).

Wait, I is the moment of inertia, I = μ r^2, where μ is the reduced mass, and r is the bond length.

So first, let's compute μ.

The masses are Mx=20 amu and My=2 amu. So the reduced mass μ = (Mx * My)/(Mx + My) )= (20 * 2)/(20 + 2) = 40/22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.818 amu.

Wait, 1 amu is about 1.66e-27 kg. So μ = 1.818 * 1.66e-27 kg ≈ 2.999e-27 kg ≈ 3e-27 kg.

The bond length r is 2 angstroms, which is 2e-10 meters.

So I = μ r² = 3e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.2e-46 kg m².

Now, compute E_rot(J=1) - E_rot(J=0) = (ħ²)/(2I) * (J=1 is 2, J=0 is 0). Wait, let me think again. The energy levels for rotation are given by E_rot(J) = (ħ² J (J+1)) / (2 I). So the difference between J=1 and J=0 is (2 * 3 - 0) * ħ²/(2I)?

Wait, no. Let me recalculate:

E_rot(0) = (0*(0+1)) * ħ²/(2I) = 0.

E_rot(1) = (1*2) * ħ²/(2I) = (2 ħ²)/(2I) )= ħ²/(I).

So the difference is E_rot(1) - E_rot(0) = ħ²/(I).

Compute ħ: it's h/(2π) ≈ 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So ħ² ≈ (1.05e-34)^2 ≈ 1.1e-68 (J·s)^2.

I is 1.2e-46 kg m².

So ħ²/(I) = (1.1e-68 ) / (1.2e-46) ) ≈ 9.17e-23 J.

Hmm, that's about 5.7e-6 eV. Because 1 eV is 1.6e-19 J, so 9.17e-23 J is about 5.73e-5 eV.

Wait, that's way smaller than the vibrational energy difference of about 1.66 eV. So the rotational transition requires much less energy.

So if the molecule is in the ground state (n=0, J=0), the next possible state with the lowest energy would be J=1, since the energy required is much lower than the vibrational transition.

Wait, but the question says it's in its fundamental state, which in terms of vibration is n=0. So the next state would be either J=1 (same n=0) or n=1 (same J=0). Since the energy for J=1 is lower, the molecule will transition to J=1.

Wait, but perhaps the question is considering the molecule being in the lowest possible state, which might already be J=0. So the next state is J=1 (if allowed by selection rules).

Wait, but the selection rules for rotational transitions are ΔJ = ±1, and for vibrational transitions, Δn = ±1. So in this case, if the photon is absorbed, it can cause a transition either to J=1 (if rotational) or n=1 (if vibrational). Since the rotational transition requires less energy, the photon's energy should match that rotational energy difference.

So the photon's energy must match E_rot(J=1) – E_rot(J=0) = ħ²/(I) ≈ 9.17e-23 J.

Wait, but the question asks for the photon's momentum, not energy. So how do I find the momentum?

Well, the energy of a photon is E = p c, where p is momentum and c is the speed of light.

So p = E / c.

Wait, but that's only if E is in joules and p in kg·m/s.

Wait, E_photon = h f = p c, so p = E_photon / c.

So if E_photon is the energy difference ħ²/(I), then p = [ (ħ²)/(I) ] / c.

Let me compute that.

First, ħ²/(I) ≈ 9.17e-23 J.

Speed of light c is about 3e8 m/s.

So p = 9.17e-23 J / (3e8 m/s) ≈ 3.057e-31 kg·m/s.

Wait, but let me compute it more accurately.

Wait, let's go through the calculations step by step:

Compute I: I = μ r².

μ = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) ) amu = 40/22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.81818 amu.

Convert μ to kg: 1.81818 amu * 1.6605e-27 kg/amu ≈ 1.81818 * 1.6605e-27 ≈ 2.999e-27 kg.

r is 2 angstroms = 2e-10 m.

I = μ r² = 2.999e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 2.999e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.1996e-46 kg m².

E_rot(J=1) - E_rot(J=0) = ħ²/(I) = ( (1.0545718e-34 J·s)^2 ) / (1.1996e-46 kg m²).

Compute numerator: (1.0545718e-34)^2 ≈ 1.112e-68 (J·s)^2.

Divide by denominator: 1.112e-68 / 1.1996e-46 ≈ 9.27e-23 J.

So E_photon = 9.27e-23 J.

Now compute p: p = E_photon / c = 9.27e-23 J / (3e8 m/s) = 3.09e-31 kg·m/s.

Wait, but looking at the options, the choices are in the range of 1e-27 to 2e-27 N·s.

Wait a minute—oh wait! I think I made a mistake. Because 1 N·s is 1 kg·m/s. So the momentum p I computed is 3.09e-31 kg·m/s, which is 3.09e-31 N·s. But the options are much larger than that. So maybe I made a mistake in choosing which transition to consider.

Hmm, perhaps I should consider the vibrational transition instead. Because the rotational transition requires a much lower energy, but perhaps the selection rules don't allow it. Wait, in the rotation-vibration model, for a transition to occur, perhaps both vibrational and rotational changes are allowed. Or maybe the question is only considering vibrational transitions.

Wait, but the question says: "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy." So it's the next state in the overall energy ordering. Since the rotational states are much lower in energy than the vibrational ones, perhaps the next state is a higher rotational state.

But the moment I calculated for the rotational transition gives a much smaller momentum than the options. So perhaps I should reevaluate my approach.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the model is considering the molecule's vibrational energy transition. Let's compute the energy for the vibrational transition.

E_vibrational = h w = 6.626e-34 J·s * 4e14 Hz = 2.65e-19 J.

So the photon's momentum p = E/c = 2.65e-19 J / (3e8 m/s) ≈ 8.83e-28 kg·m/s = 8.83e-28 N·s.

Looking at the options, option A is 1.9e-28 N·s, which is about twice my computed value. Hmm, that's close but not exact.

Wait, let me recompute:

h is 6.626e-34 J·s.

w is 4e14 rad/s, so f = w/(2π) ≈ (4e14)/(6.28) ≈ 6.366e13 Hz.

Wait, no. Because E = ħ w, not h w.

Oh! Wait, that's an important point. When the energy is given by E = hn, but n is in terms of frequency. Alternatively, for quantum harmonic oscillator, the energy is E_n = (n + 1/2) h w. So the energy difference between n=0 and n=1 is h w.

But wait, sometimes E is expressed as E = ħ ω, especially when ω is in radians per second.

Wait, let me clarify. The angular frequency is given as w = 4e14 rad/s.

The energy difference for a vibrational transition from n=0 to n=1 is ΔE = h w. Because E_n = (n + 1/2) ħ w. So ΔE = ħ w (because the difference between n=1 and n=0 is ħ w ).

Wait, no. Let me think again. For a quantum harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are E_n = (n + 1/2) h f, where f is the frequency. But sometimes, the angular frequency ω is used, and in that case, E_n = (n + 1/2) ħ ω.

So the energy difference between n=1 and n=0 is ΔE = E_1 - E_0 = ħ ω.

Because E_1 = (1 + 1/2) ħ ω = (3/2) ħ ω.

E_0 = (0 + 1/2) ħ ω = (1/2) ħ ω.

ΔE = E_1 - E_0 = ħ ω.

So, ΔE = ħ w.

Then, the photon's energy must be ħ w.

Thus, the photon's momentum p is E_photon / c = (ħ w) / c.

Let me compute that.

ħ = 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

w = 4e14 rad/s.

c = 3e8 m/s.

So, E_photon = ħ w = 1.0545718e-34 *4e14 = 4.218e-20 J.

p = E_photon / c = 4.218e-20 J / 3e8 m/s = 1.406e-28 kg·m/s = 1.406e-28 N·s.

Looking at the options, option D is 1.4e-28 N·s. So that would be the correct choice.

But wait, why did I get such a different result when considering the rotational transition earlier? Because perhaps the question isn't considering the rotational transition but only the vibrational one. But in the earlier calculation, the rotational transition's energy was much lower, so why would the photon need to have higher energy?

Ah, perhaps because the selection rules only allow for certain transitions. For example, in the pure rotational spectrum, the selection rule is ΔJ = ±1, and the photon's energy must match the rotational transition. However, in the vibration-rotation spectrum, transitions can involve changes in both J and n.

But the question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy. So, if the molecule is in the fundamental state (n=0, J=0), the next possible state would be n=0, J=1. But wait, I thought that the energy for J=1 is much lower than the vibrational transition. So why is the photon's energy matching the vibrational transition?

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again: the fundamental state is the lowest energy state, which includes both n=0 and J=0. The next state with the lowest energy would be either J=1 (same n=0) or n=1 (same J=0). Since the rotational transition requires a much smaller energy jump, the next state would be J=1, n=0.

But earlier, when I computed the rotational transition's photon momentum, I got 3e-31 N·s, which isn't any of the options. So perhaps the question is considering the vibrational transition, not the rotational one.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering that the molecule is treated as a rigid rotor, so the bond length is fixed, implying that the vibrational energy isn't considered. But the question says that the model is a non-rigid rotor, which implies that the bond length can change, so both rotation and vibration are considered.

Alternatively, perhaps the confusion is about whether the model includes vibration. The question states it's the quantum rotation-vibration model, which suggests that both are included.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to think about which transition would require the photon's energy to match.

If the molecule is in the fundamental state (n=0, J=0), and the next state is (n=0, J=1), then the energy difference is about 9.27e-23 J, as computed earlier. If the photon's energy is this, then its momentum is p = E_photon / c ≈ 3.09e-31 kg·m/s = 3.09e-31 N·s. But none of the options are this small.

So perhaps the next state is (n=1, J=0). The energy difference for that transition would be the vibrational energy difference, which is ħ ω ≈ 4.22e-20 J, leading to p ≈ 1.4e-28 N·s, which matches option D.

So why is this the case? Because even though the rotational transition requires less energy, perhaps the selection rules make that transition forbidden or less likely, but the question is about the next state regardless of selection rules. Or perhaps the question is considering only the vibrational transition.

Alternatively, perhaps the model being used in the question is such that the energy levels are treated as purely vibrational, and the problem is considering only that part.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the molecule is in the ground rotational state but the vibrational state. So, to get to the next energy state, it would need to change the vibrational state. Because the rotational transition's energy is much smaller, but perhaps the question is about the vibrational transition.

But the options don't have the small momentum (~3e-31), so I think I must be missing something.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the rotational energy difference. Let me double-check.

I = μ r².

μ = (20 * 2) / (20+2) = 40/22 ≈ 1.818 amu.

1.818 amu * 1.66e-27 kg/amu ≈ 2.999e-27 kg.

r = 2e-10 m.

I = 2.999e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 2.999e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.1996e-46 kg·m².

Compute ħ²/(2I) for J=1:

E_rot(J=1) = ħ² (2) / (2I) = ħ²/(I).

So ħ² is (1.0545718e-34)^2 ≈ 1.112e-68 J²·s².

So E_rot(J=1) - E_rot(J=0) = 1.112e-68 / 1.1996e-46 ≈ 9.27e-23 J.

Thus, the photon's momentum would be 9.27e-23 J / (3e8 m/s) ≈ 3e-31 N·s. But that's not an option.

So perhaps I should think about the vibrational transition.

E_photon = ħ ω = 1.0545718e-34 * 4e14 ≈ 4.218e-20 J.

p_photon = E / c = 4.218e-20 / 3e8 ≈ 1.406e-28 N·s.

Which matches option D.

So, perhaps the correct answer is D.

But why is the rotational transition's momentum so much smaller and not matching any option? Maybe the problem is considering only the vibrational transition, not the rotational one.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is mistaken, but given the options, option D seems to fit the vibrational transition calculation.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the momentum of the photon required for the diatomic molecule to transition to the next state with the lowest possible energy, we analyze the energy differences in the quantum rotation-vibration model. The molecule is initially in the fundamental state, which corresponds to the lowest vibrational state (n=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0). The next state with the lowest energy could involve either a vibrational transition (n=0 → n=1) or a rotational transition (J=0 → J=1). 

### Key Calculations:

1. **Vibrational Energy Difference**:  
   The vibrational energy levels are given by \( E_n = \left(n + \frac{1}{2}\right) \hbar \omega \).  
   The energy difference between \( n=0 \) and \( n=1 \) is:  
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{vibrational}} = \hbar \omega
   \]  
   Substituting \( \hbar = 1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \) and \( \omega = 4 \times 10^{14} \, \text{rad/s} \):  
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{vibrational}} = (1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}) \times (4 \times 10^{14}) = 4.218 \times 10^{-20} \, \text{J}
   \]  

2. **Rotational Energy Difference**:  
   The rotational energy levels are given by \( E_J = \frac{\hbar^2 J (J+1)}{2I} \), where \( I = \mu r^2 \) is the moment of inertia.  
   The reduced mass \( \mu \) is:  
   \[
   \mu = \frac{M_x M_y}{M_x + M_y} = \frac{20 \, \text{amu} \times 2 \, \text{amu}}{20 \, \text{amu} + 2 \, \text{amu}} = \frac{40}{22} \approx 1.818 \, \text{amu}
   \]  
   Converting \( \mu \) to kilograms (\( 1 \, \text{amu} = 1.6605 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg} \)):  
   \[
   \mu = 1.818 \times 1.6605 \times 10^{-27} \approx 2.999 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}
   \]  
   The bond length \( r = 2 \, \text{Å} = 2 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m} \), so:  
   \[
   I = \mu r^2 = (2.999 \times 10^{-27}) \times (2 \times 10^{-10})^2 = 1.1996 \times 10^{-46} \, \text{kg·m}^2
   \]  
   The energy difference between \( J=0 \) and \( J=1 \) is:  
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{rotational}} = \frac{\hbar^2}{I} = \frac{(1.0545718 \times 10^{-34})^2}{1.1996 \times 10^{-46}} \approx 9.27 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}
   \]  

3. **Photon Momentum**:  
   The momentum of a photon is related to its energy by \( p = \frac{E}{c} \), where \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \).  

   - For the **vibrational transition**:  
     \[
     p_{\text{vibrational}} = \frac{\Delta E_{\text{vibrational}}}{c} = \frac{4.218 \times 10^{-20}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 1.406 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{N·s}
     \]  

   - For the **rotational transition**:  
     \[
     p_{\text{rotational}} = \frac{\Delta E_{\text{rotational}}}{c} = \frac{9.27 \times 10^{-23}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 3.09 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{N·s}
     \]  

### Conclusion:  
The rotational transition requires significantly less energy than the vibrational transition. However, the rotational transition momentum (\( 3.09 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{N·s} \)) does not match any of the provided options, while the vibrational transition momentum (\( 1.406 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{N·s} \)) matches option **D**. Therefore, the problem likely considers only the vibrational transition.

**Answer: D**
