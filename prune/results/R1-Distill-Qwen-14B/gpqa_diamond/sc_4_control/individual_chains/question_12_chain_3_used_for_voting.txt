Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a pion decay. Hmm, I remember that pions decay into other particles, like muons and neutrinos. The problem says Pi(+) is stationary and it decays into mu(+) and a neutrino. Oh wait, but wait—neutrinos are neutral, right? So the charges must balance out, but that's maybe not directly relevant here.

The given data: the rest mass of Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV, and the muon is 105.7 MeV. The question is about the kinetic energy of the products. The options are A, B, C, D with various pairs of energies. 

I think I need to use conservation laws here—conservation of energy and momentum. Since the pion is initially at rest, the total momentum after decay must be zero. So the momentum of the muon and the neutrino must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. 

Wait, but neutrinos are super light, right? Or maybe in this case, they can be considered massless compared to the other particles. I think in these kinds of problems, we often assume the neutrino has negligible mass. So its energy is approximately equal to its momentum times c, but since we're in MeV units, maybe c is set to 1 for simplicity.

So let's think about energy. The total energy before decay is just the rest energy of the pion, which is 139.6 MeV. After decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino. 

But wait, the muon has rest mass, so its energy will be its rest energy plus kinetic energy. The neutrino's energy is all kinetic since its rest mass is negligible. So:

E_total = E_muon + E_neutrino = m_pi c²

But E_muon = sqrt( (p_mu c)^2 + (m_mu c²)^2 ) / c² ? Wait, no, units might get messy. Maybe better to work in units where c=1. Then E = sqrt(p² + m²), where m is in MeV/c², and p in MeV/c. But if c=1, then E = sqrt(p² + m²), since (p c) would be in MeV, but when c=1, it's just p in MeV, m in MeV.

Wait, perhaps I should write it as E = sqrt( p² c^4 + m² c^4 ) / c^2? No, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think in natural units where c=1. Then E = sqrt(p² + m²), where E is in MeV, p is in MeV/c, but since c=1, p is in units that make p² have units of MeV². So m is in MeV as well (since m*c² would be in MeV when m is in MeV/c²).

So, for the muon, E_mu = sqrt( p_mu^2 + m_mu^2 ). And for the neutrino, E_nu = p_nu, since m_nu is approximately zero.

Since momentum must be conserved, the momentum of the muon and neutrino must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. So p_mu = -p_nu. But since we're dealing with magnitudes, p_mu = p_nu = p.

So, E_mu = sqrt( p^2 + (105.7)^2 )

E_nu = p

And the total energy is E_mu + E_nu = 139.6 MeV.

So the equation becomes:

sqrt( p^2 + (105.7)^2 ) + p = 139.6

Hmm, this is an equation in one variable, p. I need to solve for p.

Let me denote x = p. Then:

sqrt( x² + (105.7)^2 ) + x = 139.6

Let me rearrange:

sqrt( x² + 105.7² ) = 139.6 - x

Now, square both sides:

x² + (105.7)^2 = (139.6 - x)^2

Expand the right side:

(139.6)^2 - 2*139.6 x + x²

So:

x^2 + 105.7^2 = 139.6^2 - 2*139.6 x + x^2

The x^2 terms cancel out:

105.7^2 = 139.6^2 - 2*139.6 x

Let me compute the squares.

105.7^2 = approximately 11170.49 (since 100^2=10000, 5.7^2=32.49, 2*100*5.7=1140; so 10000+1140+32.49= 11172.49. Hmm wait, better compute accurately.

105.7 * 105.7: let's compute:

105^2 = 11025.

(0.7)^2=0.49.

And 2 * 105 * 0.7 = 147.

So (105 + 0.7)^2 = 105² + 2*105*0.7 + 0.7² = 11025 + 147 + 0.49 = 11172.49.

Similarly, 139.6^2:

Let me compute 140^2 = 19600. But 139.6 is 140 - 0.4.

So (140 - 0.4)^2 = 140² - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4² = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19488.16.

So substituting back:

11172.49 = 19488.16 - 2 * 139.6 x

Move 11172.49 to the right:

0 = 19488.16 - 11172.49 - 2 * 139.6 x

Compute 19488.16 - 11172.49:

19488.16 - 11172.49 = 8315.67.

So,

0 = 8315.67 - 279.2 x

Wait, 2*139.6 is 279.2.

So,

279.2 x = 8315.67

x = 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ Let me compute that.

Divide numerator and denominator by 279.2.

8315.67 ÷ 279.2 ≈ Let's see:

279.2 * 30 = 8376. So 279.2 * 30 is 8376, which is a bit more than 8315.67. So perhaps 29.8 or so.

Wait, 279.2 * 29.8 = ?

279.2 * 30 = 8376. So 279.2 * (30 - 0.2 )= 8376 - (279.2 * 0.2) .

279.2 * 0.2 = 55.84.

So 8376 -55.84= 8320.16.

But the numerator is 8315.67, which is a bit less than 8320.16. So 29.8 would give 8320.16, which is 4.49 more than needed.

So try 29.7:

279.2 * 29.7 = ?

279.2 * 29 = 279.2 * 30 = 8376 minus 279.2 → 8376 - 279.2 = 8096.8.

Then 279.2 * 0.7 = 195.44.

So 29.7 * 279.2 = 8096.8 + 195.44 = 8292.24.

Wait, but 8292.24 is less than 8315.67. The difference is 8315.67 - 8292.24 = 23.43.

So how much more?

Each 0.1 of x adds 279.2 * 0.1 = 27.92 to the product.

We need to add 23.43. So 23.43 / 27.92 ≈ 0.839 of 0.1.

So x ≈ 29.7 + 0.839 ≈ 29.7 + 0.84 = 30.54? Wait, no, because I think I messed up.

Wait, 29.7 gives 8292.24, which is 23.43 short of 8315.67.

So each 0.1 x is 27.92. So to get 23.43, it's 23.43 / 27.92 = approx 0.84 of 0.1. So the additional x is 0.084.

So x ≈ 29.7 + 0.084 = 29.784.

Wait, but wait, that would make x about 29.784. But wait, 29.784 * 279.2 = let me check:

29.7 *279.2 = approx 8292.24 as before.

0.084 *279.2 = roughly 23.39.

So 8292.24 +23.39 = 8315.63, which is very close to 8315.67. So x ≈ 29.784. So p ≈ 29.784 MeV/c.

Wait, but wait, let me double-check the calculation.

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to compute x = 8315.67 / 279.2.

8315.67 / 279.2.

Let me compute 279.2 * 29.7 = ?

Wait, 279.2 *29= 8096.8, 279.2 *0.7=195.44. So 8096.8 +195.44 = 8292.24.

Then, 279.2 *29.784 = 279.2*(29.7 + 0.084) = 8292.24 + (279.2 *0.084).

279.2 *0.084 = approx 23.43.

So 8292.24 +23.43=8315.67. Perfect. So x=29.784 MeV/c.

So p is approximately 29.784 MeV/c.

Wait, but wait, I'm not so sure because when I squared both sides, sometimes extraneous solutions can appear, but in this case since everything is positive, it should be okay.

Now, the energy of the neutrino is E_nu = p = 29.784 MeV.

The muon's energy is E_mu = sqrt( p^2 + m_mu^2 ) = sqrt( (29.784)^2 + (105.7)^2 )

Let me compute 29.784 squared: approx 29.78^2.

29^2=841, 0.78^2≈0.6. So 29.78^2 ≈ (30 -0.22)^2 = 900 - 2*30*0.22 +0.0484=900-13.2 +0.0484= 886.8484. So perhaps 887 MeV².

Wait, but more accurately:

29.784^2 = let me compute:

= (30 - 0.216)^2 = 30^2 - 2*30*0.216 + (0.216)^2 = 900 - 12.96 + 0.046656 = 887.086656.

And 105.7^2 is 11172.49.

So E_mu = sqrt(887.086656 + 11172.49) = sqrt(12059.576656).

What's the square root of 12059.576656?

Well, 110^2=12100, which is a bit higher than 12059, so sqrt ≈ 109.8.

Wait, 109^2 = 11881, 110^2=12100. 12059 is 12100 -41, so sqrt(12059)= approx 110 - (41)/(2*110) )= 110 - 41/(220) ≈ 110 - 0.186 = 109.814.

So E_mu ≈ 109.814 MeV.

So the muon's energy is about 109.814 MeV, and the neutrino's is about 29.784 MeV.

But wait, the rest mass of the muon is 105.7 MeV. So the kinetic energy is E_mu - m_mu.

So KE_mu = 109.814 - 105.7 = approximately 4.114 MeV.

The neutrino's KE is E_nu, which is 29.784 MeV.

Wait, but wait: the neutrino's rest mass is zero, so all its energy is kinetic. So the kinetic energies are 4.114 MeV and 29.784 MeV.

Looking at the options:

Option D says 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV. That seems to match.

Option B:7.2 and 32.8. No, too high.

Option C:3.52 and 20.8. No, lower.

Option A:2.84 and 26.8. Lower.

So the correct option should be D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the kinetic energy of the product particles in the decay process:

\[
\pi^+ \rightarrow \mu^+ + \nu
\]

where the pion (\(\pi^+\)) is stationary, we use conservation of energy and momentum. The rest masses are given as \(m_{\pi^+} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}\) and \(m_{\mu^+} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV}\). The neutrino (\(\nu\)) is assumed to be massless.

### Conservation of Energy
The total energy before decay is the rest energy of the pion:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = m_{\pi^+}c^2 = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}.
\]
After the decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_{\mu^+} + E_{\nu}.
\]
The muon's energy is:
\[
E_{\mu^+} = \sqrt{p_{\mu}^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2},
\]
where \(p_{\mu}\) is the momentum of the muon. The neutrino's energy is equal to its momentum since it is massless:
\[
E_{\nu} = p_{\nu}.
\]

### Conservation of Momentum
Since the pion is initially stationary, the total momentum after the decay must be zero:
\[
p_{\mu} = p_{\nu}.
\]
Thus, \(p_{\mu} = p_{\nu} = p\).

### Solving for \(p\)
The total energy equation becomes:
\[
\sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2} + p = m_{\pi^+}.
\]
Substituting \(m_{\pi^+} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}\) and \(m_{\mu^+} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV}\), we solve for \(p\):
\[
\sqrt{p^2 + 105.7^2} + p = 139.6.
\]
Rearranging:
\[
\sqrt{p^2 + 105.7^2} = 139.6 - p.
\]
Squaring both sides:
\[
p^2 + 105.7^2 = (139.6 - p)^2.
\]
Expanding and simplifying:
\[
p^2 + 11172.49 = 19488.16 - 279.2p + p^2.
\]
Canceling \(p^2\) and solving for \(p\):
\[
11172.49 = 19488.16 - 279.2p.
\]
\[
279.2p = 19488.16 - 11172.49.
\]
\[
279.2p = 8315.67.
\]
\[
p = \frac{8315.67}{279.2} \approx 29.784 \, \text{MeV/c}.
\]

### Kinetic Energy of the Muon
The muon's total energy is:
\[
E_{\mu^+} = \sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2}.
\]
Substituting \(p = 29.784 \, \text{MeV/c}\) and \(m_{\mu^+} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV}\):
\[
E_{\mu^+} = \sqrt{29.784^2 + 105.7^2}.
\]
\[
E_{\mu^+} = \sqrt{887.09 + 11172.49} = \sqrt{12059.58} \approx 109.81 \, \text{MeV}.
\]
The kinetic energy of the muon is:
\[
KE_{\mu^+} = E_{\mu^+} - m_{\mu^+} = 109.81 - 105.7 = 4.11 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Kinetic Energy of the Neutrino
The neutrino's kinetic energy is equal to its energy, as it is massless:
\[
KE_{\nu} = E_{\nu} = p = 29.784 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Final Answer
The kinetic energies of the muon and neutrino are approximately \(4.12 \, \text{MeV}\) and \(29.8 \, \text{MeV}\), respectively. This matches **Option D**.
