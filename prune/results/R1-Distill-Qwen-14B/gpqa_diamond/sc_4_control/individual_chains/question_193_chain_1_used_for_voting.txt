Okay, so I have this astronomy question here, and I need to figure out the answer. Let's try to break it down step by step. 

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 divided by parallax to the fifth power. So, the formula given is N ∝ 1/plx^5. I'm supposed to find out how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance r. The options are different powers of r, like r^3, r^5, etc.

Hmm, I remember that parallax and distance are inversely related. Parallax (plx) is equal to 1 over the distance (d) in parsecs. So, plx = 1/d. That means if the distance increases, the parallax decreases.

Wait, so if N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5, and plx is 1/d, then substituting that in, we get N ∝ 1 / ( (1/d) )^5. Let me calculate that. 1/(1/d)^5 is the same as d^5. So N is proportional to d^5. 

But wait, the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range. Oh, right, because when you discuss the number of stars in a thin shell of radius r, you're looking at the differential change. So I think this involves differentials.

I recall that the number of stars in a thin shell between r and r + dr is given by the derivative of N with respect to r multiplied by dr. But wait, in this case, the number of stars N is proportional to d^5, right? So, N ∝ d^5. Let me think about this more carefully.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of differential number. If N is proportional to d^5, then the number of stars per unit volume would depend on how the volume changes with d. No, wait, the question is about the number of stars per unit distance. So maybe it's about dN/dr.

Wait, let me rephrase. The number of stars in a region of the sky as a function of distance. The question says the number varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So N = k * (1/plx^5), where k is some constant.

Since plx = 1/d, substituting that in gives N = k * d^5. So N is proportional to d^5. 

But wait, the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range. So, if I have a small change in distance dr, the change in number of stars would be approximately dN = (dN/dr) dr. So, dN/dr is the derivative of N with respect to r.

Since N ∝ r^5, the derivative dN/dr would be proportional to 5 r^4. But wait, the options don't have an r^4 option as correct. Let me check the options again. Oh, option C is r^4. But wait, wait. Let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here.

Wait, no, the question is about the number of stars per unit distance. So if N is proportional to r^5, then the number of stars in a shell of thickness dr would be dN = (dN/dr) dr = 5 r^4 dr. So the number of stars per unit distance (dN/dr) is proportional to r^4. So the correct answer would be option C, which is ~ r^4.

Wait, but the question is phrased as "how does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?" So it's about dN/dr. So yeah, that would be r^4.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The number of stars in a thin shell of radius r is proportional to the surface area of the shell (which is 4π r²) times the number density of stars. But in this problem, the number of stars is given as varying with parallax as 1/plx^5. So maybe it's a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about the differential number of stars per unit distance. Let me think about the relation between parallax and distance.

Parallax plx (in arcseconds) is equal to 1/d (in parsecs). So, plx = 1/d => d = 1/plx.

Given that N ∝ 1/(plx)^5, substituting d gives N ∝ d^5. So the number of stars increases as d^5. 

But when we talk about how the number changes with distance, we think in terms of dN/dr, which is the derivative of N with respect to r. So dN/dr = 5 k d^4, where k is the constant of proportionality. So dN/dr ∝ d^4.

Looking at the options, option C is ~r^4, which matches. So the correct answer should be option C.

The question states that the number of stars in a specific region of the sky varies with parallax as \( N \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^5} \), where \( \text{plx} \) is the parallax. Since parallax is inversely related to distance (\( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \)), substituting this relationship into the expression for \( N \) gives \( N \propto d^5 \), where \( d \) is the distance in parsecs.

To determine how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance (\( r \)), we calculate the derivative of \( N \) with respect to \( r \). Since \( N \propto r^5 \), the derivative \( \frac{dN}{dr} \) is proportional to \( r^4 \). This means that the number of stars per unit distance increases as \( r^4 \).

Thus, the correct answer is:

Answer: C
