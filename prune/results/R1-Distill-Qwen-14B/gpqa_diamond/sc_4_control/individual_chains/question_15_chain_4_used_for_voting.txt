Okay, so I've got this question about detecting transiting planets, and I need to figure out which planet has a higher probability of transiting. Hmm, I remember that the transit method involves the planet passing in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. But I'm a bit rusty on the exact factors that influence the probability of a transit.

The question says both planets have the same mass. That's interesting. They were detected via the RV method, so we know their minimum masses. But when considering transits, the mass might not be the key factor here. Because the mass is the same, maybe other factors like orbital period, star properties matter more.

The orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than Planet_2. So Planet_1 orbits closer to its star, right? Because a shorter period implies a smaller orbit radius, assuming same star mass. Wait, but the host stars are different. Planet_1's host is twice as massive as Planet_2's. Oh, because Planet_1 has a more massive star, would that affect the orbit?

Wait, Kepler's third law might come into play here. The period relates to the semi-major axis and the mass of the star. The formula is P² = (4π²/G(M+m)) * a³. Since the planets have the same mass (and M >> m for both stars), P² is proportional to a³/(M_star). So for Planet_1, P1 = (3)^-1 * P2, since its period is 3 times shorter. Let me write that as P1 = P2/3.

So for the periods, P1 = P2/3.

We can relate the semi-major axes a using Kepler's law. Because M1 is twice M2: M1 = 2*M2.

So for Planet_1: (P1)^2 = (4π²/G(M1)) a1³.

For Planet_2: (P2)^2 = (4π²/(G M2)) a2³.

Dividing the two equations: (P1²/P2²) = (a1³ M2) / (a2³ M1) )

Since M1 = 2 M2, and P1 = P2/3, P1² = P2²/9.

Substituting: (1/9) = (a1³ * M2) / (a2³ * 2 M2 )

Simplify M2 cancels: 1/9 = (a1³)/(2 a2³)

Multiply both sides by 2 a2³: 2 a2³ /9 = a1³

Take cube roots: a1 = (2/9)^(1/3) a2.

Wait, let me compute (2/9)^(1/3). 2 is about 2, 9 is 3^2, so 2/9 is approximately 0.222. Cube root of 0.222 is roughly 0.6. So a1 is about 0.6 a2.

Wait, but I'm not sure if I'm going the right way. Alternatively, maybe I should compute a1 and a2 in terms of each other.

Alternatively, maybe I should think about the ratio of a1 to a2.

Wait, let's go back.

We have P1 = P2/3.

M1 = 2 M2.

So, from Kepler's law, a^3 is proportional to (P^2 * M) / (1), since P² = (4π² a³)/(G M). So a³ ∝ P² M.

So a1^3 / a2^3 = (P1² M1) / (P2² M2)

Substituting P1 = P2/3, M1=2 M2:

(a1/a2)^3 = ( (P2^2/9) * 2 M2 ) / ( P2^2 * M2 )

Simplify numerator and denominator:

Numerator: (P2² /9 ) * 2 M2.

Denominator: P2² M2.

So the ratio is (2/9) * (P2² M2) ) / (P2² M2) ) = 2/9.

So a1/a2 = (2/9)^(1/3) = cube root of (2/9) ≈ cube root of 0.222 ≈ 0.6.

So a1 is about 0.6 a2.

But wait, since Planet_1 has a shorter period, it should be closer in, so a1 < a2. That makes sense.

Now, the probability of a transit is given by the formula: R_star / a.

Wait, no, I think the transit probability depends on the alignment of the orbit with our line of sight. The probability is roughly (R_star / a) * (1/(1 + (M_planet/M_star)^{1/3})) ), but since both planets have the same mass, that part is the same. So the probability is proportional to R_star / a.

Wait, but no, actually, the geometric probability (the chance that the planet's orbital plane is aligned such that it transits) is proportional to R_star/(a). Because the star's size is much smaller than the orbit, so the probability is roughly (R_star / a) * something else.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again.

The transit probability is given by the formula: P = (R_*/a) * (1/(1 + (m_p/(M_*) )^(1/3)) )) ) 

Wait no, I think that's not exactly right. Alternatively, the probability is approximately (R_star / a) * (1/(1 + (M_p/(M_*) )^(1/3) )) ), but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, the transit probability is higher when the star is larger or the planet's orbit is smaller. Because a smaller a means the planet is closer, so more likely to pass in front.

But in this case, the star radius is the same for both. Because the question says both host stars have the same radii. Oh, right! The host stars have same radii. So R_star is same.

So the probability is proportional to R_star / a. Since R_star is same, it's inversely proportional to a.

Wait no, wait: the probability to transit is proportional to (R_star / a) * something else.

Wait, let me get this correctly. The probability of a transit is given by the ratio of the star's radius to the orbital distance, multiplied by the probability of the orbital plane being edge-on. The edge-on probability is 1/(1 + (a/(R_h)), where R_h is the Hill sphere or something else? Hmm, perhaps I'm mixing things up.

Wait, I think the geometric probability for a transit is approximately (R_star / a) multiplied by the probability that the inclination is such that the planet crosses our line of sight. That probability is 1/(1 + (a/(R_star)) ), but wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, I think the actual formula is that the probability is (R_star / a), but only when a >> R_star, which is usually the case.

Wait, another approach. The probability that the planet's orbit is aligned to cause a transit is equal to the ratio of the star's radius to the distance of the planet's orbit (a). Because the planet's orbit is a circle, and we're looking for the fraction of those circles that pass in front of the star. So the area of the star is π R_*^2, and the area where the planet can be to cause a transit is a circle of radius a (but wait, the planet's distance is a, so the probability would be (R_*) / a, because the area is proportional to 1, while the cross-section is π a². Hmm, maybe not.

Alternatively, the transit probability is given by (R_*/a) * (1/(1 + (M_p/(M_*) )^(1/3)) )) ), but since the planets have same mass and same star radii, but different a, perhaps the dominant factor is R_* / a.

Wait, let me think of it in terms of alignment. The planet's orbital plane must be aligned edge-on for a transit to occur. The probability of this is 1/(1 + (a/R_* )) ), but I'm not certain.

Wait, I think the correct formula for the geometric probability (the chance that the inclination is right) is (R_*/a) * (1/(1 + sqrt( (a^2 - R_*^2) )) )). Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should look at how the transit probability depends on a and R_*.

Alternatively, perhaps a simpler way: the transit probability is roughly (R_*/a) multiplied by some factor, but given that both stars have the same radius, it's just proportional to 1/a.

But wait, in reality, the transit probability is given by P = (R_* + R_p)^2 / (a^2) * (1/(1 + (a/(R_h)) )) ), but perhaps that's too detailed.

Alternatively, perhaps the transit probability is proportional to (R_*/a) * (something), but if R_* is same, then it's inversely proportional to a. So the planet with a smaller a has a higher probability.

But wait, looking back at the problem:

Both planets have same mass; their host stars have same radius.

Planet_1 has a shorter orbital period, so it's closer to its star (since it's more massive, but anyway, from our earlier calculation, a1 is about 0.6 a2.

So a1 < a2, which would mean (R_* / a) is larger for Planet_1, because a is smaller. So P1's transit probability is higher.

Wait, but wait. Let me compute the ratio of their transit probabilities.

Since P ∝ (R_*/a), and R_* is same for both, P1/P2 = (a2)/(a1).

From earlier, a1 = (2/9)^(1/3) a2 ≈ 0.6 a2.

So a2/a1 = 1/(0.6) ≈ 1.6667.

So P1's probability is about 1.6667 times that of P2. So Planet_1 has higher probability.

Wait, but looking at the options, let's see:

Option C: Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability.

Option D: ~2.7 times.

Wait, why is the ratio 1.65?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in computing the ratio of a1/a2.

Let me re-calculate: a1³ / a2³ = (P1² M1) / (P2² M2).

We have P1 = P2/3, so P1² = P2²/9.

M1 = 2 M2.

So (a1/a2)^3 = ( (P2²/9) * 2 M2 ) / ( P2² M2 ) )

= (2/9) * (P2² M2) / (P2² M2 )

= 2/9.

So a1/a2 = (2/9)^(1/3) = cube root of (2/9).

Compute cube root of 2: about 1.26, cube root of 9 is about 2.08. So 2/9 is ~0.222, cube root is ~0.6.

So a1 = 0.6 a2.

So a2 = a1 / 0.6 ≈ 1.666 a1.

Thus, the probability for planet 1 is (R_*/a1), and for planet 2 it's (R_*/a2). So the ratio P1/P2 = (R_*/a1) / (R_*/a2) ) = a2 / a1 = 1 / 0.6 ≈ 1.666, which is approximately 1.67 times.

So Planet_1 has about 1.67 times the probability compared to Planet_2.

But looking at the options, option C says Planet_1 is preferred, 1.65 times. That's close to 1.67, perhaps they approximated.

So the answer should be option C: Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability.

Wait, but let me double-check. Could there be any other factors influencing the transit probability?

Wait, the formula I remember for the transit probability is:

P = (R_* + R_p) / a * (1/(1 + (m_p/(M_*) )^(1/3)) )) )

But in our case, R_p (planet radius) isn't given, but since the question says both are Earth-like, perhaps their radii are same. But the problem doesn't give us R_p, so perhaps it's negligible or same for both. So the (1/(1 + ... )) term is same for both, so the main factor is R_* / a.

So yes, the transit probability is higher for Planet_1 because a1 is smaller, leading to a higher ratio (R_*/a), which is the factor determining the probability.

So the correct answer is option C, where Planet_1 is preferred with about 1.65 times higher probability.

Wait, the options are:

A) Planet_2 ~2.25 times.

B) Planet_2 ~1.5 times.

C) Planet_1 ~1.65.

D) Planet_1 ~2.7.

So the 1.67 is closest to 1.65. So option C is correct.

To determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting, we analyze the given parameters. The transit probability is proportional to \( \frac{R_*}{a} \), where \( R_* \) is the radius of the host star and \( a \) is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Since both host stars have the same radius (\( R_* \)), the key factor is the semi-major axis (\( a \)).

### Step 1: Orbital Period and Semi-Major Axis
Using Kepler's third law, \( P^2 \propto \frac{a^3}{M_*} \), where \( P \) is the orbital period and \( M_* \) is the mass of the host star:
- Planet_1 has an orbital period \( P_1 = \frac{P_2}{3} \) (three times shorter than Planet_2).
- The host star of Planet_1 has twice the mass of the host star of Planet_2 (\( M_1 = 2M_2 \)).

Substituting into Kepler's law:
\[
\frac{a_1^3}{a_2^3} = \frac{P_1^2 M_1}{P_2^2 M_2}
\]
\[
\frac{a_1^3}{a_2^3} = \frac{\left(\frac{P_2}{3}\right)^2 (2M_2)}{P_2^2 M_2}
\]
\[
\frac{a_1^3}{a_2^3} = \frac{2}{9}
\]
\[
a_1 = \left(\frac{2}{9}\right)^{1/3} a_2 \approx 0.6 a_2
\]
Thus, \( a_1 \) is approximately 0.6 times \( a_2 \), meaning Planet_1 orbits closer to its star.

### Step 2: Transit Probability
The transit probability is proportional to \( \frac{R_*}{a} \). Since \( R_* \) is the same for both stars:
\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \frac{\frac{R_*}{a_1}}{\frac{R_*}{a_2}} = \frac{a_2}{a_1}
\]
Substituting \( a_1 \approx 0.6 a_2 \):
\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \frac{a_2}{0.6 a_2} = \frac{1}{0.6} \approx 1.67
\]
Thus, Planet_1 has approximately 1.67 times the transit probability of Planet_2.

### Step 3: Evaluating the Options
- **Option A**: Incorrect. Planet_2 is not preferred, and the probability ratio is not 2.25.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. Planet_2 is not preferred, and the probability ratio is not 1.5.
- **Option C**: Correct. Planet_1 is preferred, and the probability ratio is approximately 1.65, which aligns closely with the calculated value of 1.67.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. The probability ratio is not 2.7.

### Final Answer
Planet_1 has a higher probability of transiting due to its smaller orbital distance, making it the preferred target. The probability ratio is approximately 1.65, as stated in **Option C**.
