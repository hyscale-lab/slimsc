Okay, so I've got this physics problem about electric fields around conductors. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, let's read the question again.

So, there's an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R, and inside it, there's a small cavity. The cavity is a sphere with radius r, and its center is a distance s away from the conductor's center. The point P is outside the conductor, at a distance L from the conductor's center. The distance from P to the cavity's center is l, and l and L are both greater than R. The angle between l and s is theta.

A small positive charge +q is placed inside the cavity. I need to find the electric field E at point P.

Wait, I remember that when charges are inside the cavity of a conductor, the conductor's charges redistribute. But wait, the conductor is initially uncharged. When we put a charge inside the cavity, the conductor's inner surface will have an induced charge. Oh right, the method of images might come into play here.

So when a charge is inside a conducting cavity, the inner surface of the conductor will have an induced charge equal and opposite to the charge inside. But wait, the conductor itself is neutral. So the inner surface will have -q, and the outer surface must have +q to balance it. Because the total charge of the conductor is zero, the inner surface has -q, and the outer surface must have +q to make the total conductor's charge zero.

Wait no, no. Wait, the conductor was initially uncharged. So when I place a charge +q inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor (the cavity wall) will have an induced charge of -q. Since the conductor as a whole was neutral, the outer surface must have a charge of +q to balance. Because the conductor's total charge is zero, so inner is -q, outer is +q. Yeah, that makes sense.

Now, the point P is outside the conductor. So the electric field at P would be due to the charge on the outer surface of the conductor. Because the inner charges (cavity and conductor's inner induced charge) are screened by the conductor's material.

But wait, no. Wait, the conductor is a conductor, so the charges redistribute. The field inside the conductor material is zero. So for any point outside the conductor, the electric field is the same as if all the charge on the conductor were concentrated at its center. Because of the spherical symmetry.

Wait, but in this case, the charge distribution might not be symmetric because the cavity is offset by a distance s, so the charge inside the cavity isn't at the center of the conductor. Hmm, but wait, the conductor's outer surface charge is +q, but its distribution... Wait, if the cavity's charge is not at the center, the outer surface charge would adjust to maintain the field. But for a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium, the electric field inside the conductor is zero. So the outer surface's charge distribution would be such that the field outside the conductor is as if all the charge were at the center.

Wait, maybe not. Because the conductor's outer surface is a sphere, so regardless of where the inner charge is, the outer surface will have a charge distribution that, when considering the field outside, behaves as if the total charge is at the center. Let me think about that.

So the conductor is a sphere with radius R, so the outer surface is a sphere of radius R. The charge on the outer surface is +q. Therefore, for any point outside the conductor, the electric field should be the same as if that +q were located at the center of the conductor. Because the conductor is a sphere, and the charge on the outer surface would distribute uniformly, right?

Wait, but the inner charge is off-center. Does that affect the outer charge's distribution? I think in a conductor with a cavity, the inner surface's charge distribution is determined by the charge inside the cavity, but the outer surface's charge distribution is determined by the overall charge on the conductor, which is +q here.

Wait, no. Let me clarify. The conductor's charge is zero before placing the charge +q in the cavity. When we put +q in the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor (the cavity's inner wall) induces a charge of -q. Since the conductor's total charge was zero, the outer surface must have a charge of +q to balance. So the outer surface's charge is +q.

But how is this +q distributed? If the cavity's charge is not at the center, the inner surface's charge would not be uniform. However, the outer surface's charge distribution is uniform if the conductor is a perfect sphere. Or wait, no. If the conductor's shape is symmetric (a sphere), then the outer surface charge would distribute uniformly regardless of the inner charge's position, right?

Wait, no. Because the inner charge is off-center, the electric field inside the conductor might not be zero. Wait, no, in electrostatics, the electric field inside the conductor material must be zero. So the charges rearrange to ensure that. So if the inner charge is off-center, how does that affect the conductor's charge distribution?

Hmm. Let me think: The inner cavity has a charge +q at a point s away from the conductor's center. The inner surface of the conductor (cavity wall) will have an induced charge of -q, but not uniformly. The inner surface would have a distribution that creates an electric field within the conductor that cancels the field from the internal charge. Wait, perhaps the inner surface's charge distribution is such that the field inside the conductor is zero.

Wait, no. The field inside the conductor is zero. The field inside the conductor (the material) is zero. But the cavity is empty except for the +q charge. So the conductor's inner surface must produce a field that exactly cancels the field due to +q inside the conductor.

But since the conductor is a sphere, perhaps the inner surface's induced charge would arrange to produce a field that cancels the internal field. Or maybe not.

Wait, maybe it's better to model this using the method of image charges. The idea is that the induced charges on the conductor can be modeled as if there's an image charge inside the cavity or outside.

Wait, but in this case, the conductor is a sphere. The charge inside the cavity is at a point s away from the center. The induced charges on the inner surface would be such that the field inside the conductor is zero. But perhaps the inner surface's induced charge would have a dipole moment or something else, but for a spherical conductor, the outer surface's charge would still be uniformly distributed.

Alternatively, perhaps the electric field outside the conductor is the same as if the +q were at the center of the conductor. Because the outer surface's charge is uniform, so the external field depends only on the total charge, not on where it's placed inside.

Wait, but wait. The conductor is a sphere, so all points on the outer surface are equidistant from the center. So regardless of where the inner charge is, the outer surface's charge distribution would be uniform. Because the conductor's own charges will move to maintain the field inside the conductor as zero. But the inner charge is inside the cavity, so the conductor's inner surface must adjust to cancel the field inside the conductor.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to approach this from another angle.

The conductor is neutral, so when you put +q in the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor (cavity's inner wall) will have -q, and the outer surface will have +q. Now, the outer surface is a spherical shell of radius R. The charges on a spherical shell produce an electric field outside the shell as if all the charge were at the center. So the electric field outside the conductor (at point P) is due to the +q on the outer surface, and it should behave as if the charge is at the center of the conductor.

So the electric field at P would be E = (1/(4πε₀)) * (q)/(L²), because L is the distance from the center of the conductor to P.

Wait, but in the problem statement, point P's distance from the center of the cavity is l, and the angle is theta. So maybe the position of P relative to the cavity affects the field? Or does the field only depend on the conductor's charge and not on the cavity's position?

Wait, let me think again. The conductor's outer surface has +q. So the field outside is as if the charge were at the center of the conductor. So regardless of where the charge inside the cavity is, the external field is the same as if the conductor's charge were at the center. So the field at P depends only on the distance from the conductor's center to P, which is L. So the correct option would be option B.

Wait, but let me check the options.

Option B is E = (1/(4πε₀)) * q/(L²).

Wait, but what about the position of the cavity? Because P is at a distance l from the cavity's center, with l and L both greater than R, and a certain angle. Why would these factors matter if the field is only due to the conductor's outer charge?

Hmm, another approach: perhaps the field is due to both the cavity's charge and the conductor's induced charges. But no, the conductor's outer surface charge is what contributes to the external field. The inner surface's charge doesn't contribute outside the conductor. So the field outside is only due to the outer surface's +q charge.

So, in that case, the field at P would be calculated as if the charge is at the center of the conductor. So E = k q / L², where k is 1/(4πε₀).

Looking at the options, option B is exactly that.

But wait, another thought: could the presence of the cavity affect the field? Like, if the cavity's charge is not at the center, would that influence the conductor's outer surface's charge distribution somehow? Let me think.

The conductor's outer surface's charge distribution is only affected by the total charge on the conductor and the presence of external fields, I think. Since the conductor is isolated, and the only charge present is the +q in the cavity, the outer surface's charge is +q and it's uniformly distributed because the conductor is a sphere. So regardless of where the +q is placed inside the cavity, the outer surface's charge distribution remains uniform.

Therefore, the electric field outside is as if all the charge is at the center. So the field at P depends only on L, the distance from the conductor's center.

Wait, but the options include others with l and theta. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, no. Let me think of the point P relative to the conductor. The conductor is a sphere of radius R. P is at a distance L from the conductor's center. The point P's distance from the cavity's center is l, but that's not directly relevant because the conductor's charge is uniformly on the outer surface. So the field at P is solely due to the +q charge on the outer surface, which is as if at the conductor's center.

So, the field at P is (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L².

Which makes option B correct.

But wait, I'm a bit unsure. The presence of the cavity's off-center might somehow induce a dipole in the conductor, leading to a field that depends on the angle theta or the position l. But for a conductor, the external field should be the same as that of a point charge at the center, regardless of internal charge distributions, because the conductor shields the internal fields.

So, I think option B is correct.

The problem involves an uncharged spherical conductor of radius $R$ with a small spherical cavity inside. The cavity's center is offset by a distance $s$ from the conductor's center. A small positive charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity, and the task is to determine the electric field $\vec{E}$ at a point $P$ outside the conductor, located at a distance $L$ from the conductor's center. The distance from $P$ to the cavity's center is $l$, and $l, L > R$. The angle between $l$ and $s$ is $\theta$.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Charge Distribution in the Conductor**:  
   - When the charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor (cavity wall) induces a charge of $-q$ to cancel the electric field within the conductor's material.  
   - Since the conductor was initially neutral, the outer surface of the conductor must have a charge of $+q$ to balance the total charge.  

2. **Electric Field Outside the Conductor**:  
   - The electric field outside a spherical conductor depends only on the total charge on the outer surface and the distance from the center of the conductor.  
   - For a spherical conductor, the charge on the outer surface distributes uniformly. Thus, the electric field at any point outside the conductor is equivalent to the field produced by a point charge located at the center of the conductor.  

3. **Relevance of the Cavity's Position**:  
   - The position of the cavity's center (offset by $s$) and the angle $\theta$ do not affect the electric field outside the conductor. The field is determined solely by the total charge on the outer surface ($+q$) and the distance $L$ from the conductor's center to the point $P$.  

4. **Electric Field at Point $P$**:  
   - The electric field at $P$ is given by Coulomb's law:  
     \[
     E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}
     \]  
     This matches option **B**.

### Conclusion:
The electric field at point $P$ depends only on the total charge $+q$ on the conductor's outer surface and the distance $L$ from the conductor's center. The position of the cavity or the angle $\theta$ does not influence the external field due to the spherical symmetry of the conductor. 

**Answer: B**
