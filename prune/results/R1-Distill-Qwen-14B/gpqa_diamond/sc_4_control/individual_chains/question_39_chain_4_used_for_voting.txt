Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure out the value of 'a'. Let's see what the question is saying.

Alright, the setup is that there are 10,000 identical systems, each with a particle moving along a tube (x-axis). The wave function given is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. When they measure the position, all the particles are found between x=1 and x=3. So the wave function must be non-zero only in that interval.

Wait, but in quantum mechanics, the wave function's square modulus gives the probability density. Oh right, the probability of finding the particle at a certain position is the square of the absolute value of the wave function. So, the wave function must not be zero outside 1<x<3 because the particles aren't found there.

Hmm, but wait, the wave function's given as (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Let me write that down. So the wave function ψ(x) is a function of x. The real part is (a / sqrt(1+x)), and the imaginary part is -0.5 (since i is the imaginary unit).

The absolute square of ψ is |ψ|² = [a^2/(1+x)] + (0.5)^2. Because when you take the absolute value squared, you square the real part and the imaginary part and add them. So |ψ(x)|² = (a^2)/(1+x) + 0.25.

But wait, for the wave function to be normalizable, the integral of |ψ|² from x=1 to x=3 must equal 1. Because the probability of finding the particle in that region is 100%, and it's a normalized wave function.

So the integral of |ψ|² dx from 1 to 3 equals 1.

Let me write that down:

∫₁³ [ (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx = 1.

I can split this integral into two parts:

a² ∫₁³ (1/(1+x)) dx + 0.25 ∫₁³ dx = 1.

Let me compute each integral separately.

First integral: ∫ (1/(1+x)) dx from 1 to 3. The antiderivative of 1/(1+x) is ln|1+x|. Evaluating from 1 to 3:

ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(4/2) = ln(2).

So the first part is a² * ln(2).

Second integral: ∫ dx from 1 to 3 is 3-1=2. So 0.25 * 2 = 0.5.

Adding them together: a² * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So a² * ln(2) = 0.5.

Therefore, a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

Compute ln(2) is approximately 0.6931. So 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

Wait, no, wait: 0.5 divided by 0.6931 is about 0.7213. So a² ≈ 0.7213 → a = sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.85. So that's close.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations. Did I make any mistake?

Wait, the wave function is given as (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So when I compute |ψ|², it's (a/sqrt(1+x))² + (0.5)^2, right? Because (a/sqrt(1+x)) is the real part, and 0.5 is the coefficient of the imaginary part. So yes, |ψ|² is (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25.

So the integral is correct. So the setup is correct.

So the computation steps are correct. The integral from 1 to 3 of (a²/(1+x)) dx is a² ln(2), and the integral of 0.25 is 0.5. Therefore, 0.5 + a² ln(2) = 1 → a² = 0.5 / ln(2) → a ≈ sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849, which is approximately 0.85.

So the correct answer should be option B.

To determine the value of \( a \), we start by analyzing the given wave function:

\[
\psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i.
\]

The probability density is given by the square modulus of the wave function:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25.
\]

Since the particle is only found between \( x = 1 \) and \( x = 3 \), the integral of \( |\psi(x)|^2 \) over this interval must equal 1 (normalization condition):

\[
\int_1^3 \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1.
\]

This integral can be split into two parts:

\[
a^2 \int_1^3 \frac{1}{1+x} dx + 0.25 \int_1^3 dx = 1.
\]

1. **First integral**:  
   \[
   \int_1^3 \frac{1}{1+x} dx = \ln|1+x| \Big|_1^3 = \ln(4) - \ln(2) = \ln(2).
   \]

2. **Second integral**:  
   \[
   \int_1^3 dx = 3 - 1 = 2.
   \]

Substituting these results back:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.25 \cdot 2 = 1.
\]

Simplify:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1 \implies a^2 \ln(2) = 0.5 \implies a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}.
\]

Using \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \):

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7213 \implies a \approx \sqrt{0.7213} \approx 0.849.
\]

The closest option to \( a \approx 0.849 \) is \( 0.85 \), which corresponds to option **B**.
