Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me try to break it down step by step. Hmm, the question is about stability constants and the percentage of a particular cobalt complex.

So the problem says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate. The total cobalt concentration is 0.01 M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the Co(II) thiocyanato complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. We need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species.

Wait, I remember that stability constants are used to determine the concentration of metal complexes in solution. The higher the stability constant, the more stable the complex. So the complex with the highest β is the most stable, but the question is about the blue dithiocyanato complex. I think dithiocyanato is the complex with two SCN- ligands. So that would be the Co(SCN)_2^2+ complex, which is the second complex. Because β2 is 40, β3 is 63, which is higher, so that's a triply charged SCN complex? Or maybe I'm getting the order wrong.

Let me think, the complexes would form stepwise. Co^2+ can bind SCN- to form various complexes: Co(SCN)_1, Co(SCN)_2, etc. The stability constants are given for each step. So β1 is the formation of the first complex: Co(SCN)_1^+ (since Co^2+ + SCN^- → CoSCN^+). Wait, no, wait, the charge would be Co^2+ plus one SCN^- (which is -1), so the complex would be CoSCN^+.

Wait, let me get the charges right. Co^2+ (charge +2) plus one SCN^- (charge -1) would give Co(SCN)_1^+ (charge +1). The second complex would be Co(SCN)_2^0, since +2 + 2*(-1) = 0. So the second complex is neutral. The third would be Co(SCN)_3^–1, and the fourth Co(SCN)_4^–2.

But the question is about the blue dithiocyanato complex. I think the blue color is associated with the [Co(SCN)_2]^0 complex. So that's the second complex, which has β2=40.

Wait, wait, but I've heard that the [Co(SCN)_4]^2− is a different color, like blue. Hmm, maybe I should double-check that. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the dithiocyanate as the second complex, so [Co(SCN)_2]^0. So the percentage we're looking for is the fraction of the Co^2+ that is in the form of [Co(SCN)_2]^0.

But how do I calculate the percentage of each complex? I think the approach here is to use the stability constants and the total concentration of Co to find the distribution of each species. Since the solution has a lot of SCN- (0.1 M), the complexes will form, and we need to calculate the mole fractions for each complex.

But wait, with four possible complexes, each with a different stability constant, the distribution will depend on all of them. So the problem is to find the fraction of the second complex (dithiocyanato, with two SCN- ligands) among all Co species.

I remember that the distribution of metal complexes can be found using the log of the stability constants and the ligand concentration relative to the metal concentration. The formula involves the fraction of each species as a function of the β values and the ligand-to-metal ratio.

I think the approach is to find the fraction f_n for each complex, where n is the number of SCN- ligands. The formula for the fraction is f_n = (β_n * [SCN]^n) / (1 + sum of all β_k [SCN]^k for k=0 to 4}), but wait, no. Wait, the total is the sum over all possible complexes, including the free ion.

Wait, let me recall the formula correctly. The fraction f_n is given by:

f_n = (β_n [M] [L]^n) / ( [M][L]^0 + β_1 [M][L]^1 + β_2 [M][L]^2 + ... + β_4 [M][L]^4 )

Wait, but in this case, [M] is the concentration of the metal ion, which is the free Co^2+ concentration. But wait, the total concentration of Co is given as 1e-2 M, which is the sum of all Co species: [Co^2+] + [Co(SCN)]^+ + [Co(SCN)_2]^0 + [Co(SCN)_3]^- + [Co(SCN)_4]^2-.

Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the approximation that the ligand is in excess, so [SCN^-] is approximately 0.1 M, as it's much higher than the metal concentration. But I'm not sure if that's the case here. Let me see: the metal concentration is 1e-2 M, and SCN is 0.1 M, so the ratio is 0.1/0.01 = 10. So [SCN-] is 10 times higher than the metal. That suggests that the ligand is in excess, so the free [SCN-] can be considered approximately 0.1 M.

In that case, the formation of the complexes depends on the β coefficients. The fraction f_n for each complex can be found using the formula:

f_n = (β_n [SCN]^n) / (sum from k=0 to 4 of β_k [SCN]^k )

Wait, but wait, for the nth complex, the β is the cumulative stability constant. So β_n = β_1 * β_2 * ... * β_n? Or is each β given as the stepwise constant? Wait, the problem says the stability constants are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. I think these are the stepwise stability constants, meaning β1 is for the first ligand, β2 is the second, etc. So the overall stability constant for the Co(SCN)_n complex would be the product of β1 to βn.

Wait, no, I think that the given β's are the overall stability constants for each complex. So β1 is for the first complex, β2 for the second, etc. So for example, β2 is 40, which would be the overall constant for [Co(SCN)_2]^0. So the formation of the second complex from the first would have a stepwise constant β2_step = β2 / β1.

Wait, no, perhaps I'm mixing up the definitions. Let me clarify. The stability constant for the first complex [CoSCN]^+ is K1 = β1 = 9. The second complex [Co(SCN)_2] would have a stability constant K2 = β1 * β2, since each step multiplies the previous constant. So the overall stability constant for [Co(SCN)_2]^0 would be β1 * β2 = 9 * 40 = 360.

Wait, but the problem says β1=9, β2=40, etc. So I think βn represents the stepwise stability constant for the nth ligand addition. So the overall stability for the nth complex is the product of β1 through βn.

But in this scenario, the fraction of each species is given by the sum of all possible complexes, each weighted by their overall β and the ligand concentration raised to the number of ligands.

Alternatively, I've read that the fraction of each species can be found using the formula:

f_n = (β_n [L]^n) / (1 + sum_{k=1 to n} β_k [L]^k )

Wait, perhaps that's not correct. Another approach is to model the distribution by considering the formation of each complex step by step.

Let me think about the general approach. For a metal M and ligand L, the fraction of the species ML_n is given by f_n = (β_n [L]^n) / (sum_{k=0}^{m} β_k [L]^k ), where m is the maximum number of ligands. But wait, in that case, [M] is the free metal concentration, and [L] is the free ligand concentration.

Wait, but in this problem, the total concentration of cobalt is fixed. So the sum of all species (free Co^2+ plus all complexes) equals the total [Co] = 1e-2 M.

Hmm, perhaps a better approach is to model the system with the given stability constants and ligand concentration, then compute the fractions.

Wait, another approach is to recognize that when the ligand is in excess, the free metal concentration is very low, and the majority of the metal is in the most stable complex. But in this case, since [SCN-] is 0.1 M and [Co] is 0.01 M, the ligand is 10 times higher than the metal. So the free [SCN-] can be approximated as 0.1 M.

So the step to calculate the fractions is as follows:

1. For each possible complex, calculate the overall stability constant as the product of β1 to βn. Because each βn is a stepwise constant, the overall for the nth complex is β1 * β2 * ... * βn.

Wait no, wait. Let me make sure. The overall stability constant K for the complex [Co(SCN)_n]^(2-n) would be the product of the stepwise constants up to n. So for Co(SCN)_1^+, K1 = β1 =9. For Co(SCN)_2^0, K2 = β1 * β2 =9 *40=360. For Co(SCN)_3^- , K3=9*40*63=22680. For Co(SCN)_4^2−, K4=9*40*63*16=22680 *16= 362880.

Wait, but the problem states the stability constants as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So these are the stepwise constants, not the overall. So K for the first complex is β1=9, K for the second is β1*β2=9*40=360, third is β1*β2*β3=360 *63=22680, fourth is 22680*16=362,880.

But wait, another thought: maybe each β is the overall stability constant for the nth complex. So β1 is for the first complex (n=1), β2 for the second (n=2), etc. That would make more sense. So, for the first complex, K1=β1=9, for the second, K2=β2=40, etc. But that's conflicting with the usual definition, where β is the stepwise constant. So I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, in some sources, the stability constant is given as the overall constant for the complex. For example, [Co(SCN)_n]^(charge) has a stability constant K_n. So K1 = [Co(SCN)]^+ / ([Co^2+][SCN^-]) =9. Similarly, K2 = [Co(SCN)_2]/([Co^2+][SCN^-]^2) =40. But that can't be, because for K2, that would imply that adding a second SCN- doesn't take into account the first. So I think the given β's are the stepwise constants.

Wait, wait, I think I'm getting this wrong. Let me clarify the definitions. The stepwise stability constant (β) for the nth ligand is the equilibrium constant for the reaction:

M^(n-1)L^(n-1) + L ↔ M^n L^n.

The overall stability constant for the nth complex is the product of the stepwise constants from β1 to βn.

So for [Co(SCN)_2]^0, the overall K is β1 * β2 =9 *40=360.

So, given that, each complex's stability is the product of β1 through βn.

So, to find the fraction of each complex, we can model the distribution as per the ligand and metal concentrations.

But since [Co] is 0.01 M (total) and [SCN] is 0.1 M, and assuming that [SCN] remains approximately 0.1 M (since it's in excess), the fractions can be calculated as follows.

The fraction for each species is given by:

f_n = ( K_n [Co] ) / ( [SCN]^n + sum_{k=0}^{4} K_k [Co] [SCN]^k )

Wait, no, perhaps the formula is:

The fraction f_n is the concentration of the nth complex divided by the total concentration of all complexes plus free Co^2+.

But maybe a better approach is to write the general expression for each species.

Let me denote [Co]_free as the concentration of free Co^2+.

The concentrations of the complexes are:

[Co]_0 = [Co^2+] = [Co]_free

[CoSCN]^+ = β1 [Co]_free [SCN^-]

[Co(SCN)_2]^0 = β1 β2 [Co]_free [SCN^-]^2

[Co(SCN)_3]^- = β1 β2 β3 [Co]_free [SCN^-]^3

[Co(SCN)_4]^{2−} = β1 β2 β3 β4 [Co]_free [SCN^-]^4

So the total concentration of Co is the sum of all these:

[Co]_total = [Co]_free + β1 [Co]_free [SCN] + β1 β2 [Co]_free [SCN]^2 + β1 β2 β3 [Co]_free [SCN]^3 + β1 β2 β3 β4 [Co]_free [SCN]^4

We can factor [Co]_free:

[Co]_total = [Co]_free (1 + β1 [SCN] + β1 β2 [SCN]^2 + β1 β2 β3 [SCN]^3 + β1 β2 β3 β4 [SCN]^4 )

But [Co]_total is given as 0.01 M, so:

[Co]_free = [Co]_total / (1 + β1 [SCN] + β1 β2 [SCN]^2 + β1 β2 β3 [SCN]^3 + β1 β2 β3 β4 [SCN]^4 )

Once we have [Co]_free, we can find the concentration of each complex and then find the fraction of the second complex.

But wait, if [SCN] is 0.1 M, let's compute each term in the denominator.

Compute each term:

Term 0: 1

Term 1: β1 [SCN] =9 *0.1=0.9

Term 2: β1 β2 [SCN]^2 =9 *40 * (0.1)^2 = 9*40 *0.01= 3.6

Term 3: β1 β2 β3 [SCN]^3=9 *40 *63 * (0.1)^3 → 9*40=360; 360*63=22680. 22680 * (0.1)^3=22680 *0.001=22.68.

Term4: β1 β2 β3 β4 [SCN]^4=9*40*63*16*(0.1)^4 → 9*40=360; 360*63=22680; 22680 *16=362880. 362880 * (0.1)^4=362880 *0.0001=36.288.

So sum each term:

Term0:1

Term1:0.9 → sum so far: 1.9

Term2:3.6 → sum 5.5

Term3:22.68 → sum 28.18

Term4:36.288 → sum 64.468.

So denominator is 64.468.

Then [Co]_free = [Co]_total / 64.468 → 0.01 /64.468 ≈ 0.0001551 M.

Wait, 0.01 divided by about 64.468. Let me compute that.

0.01 / 64.468 → approximately 0.0001551 M.

Now, compute the concentration of each complex.

For the second complex, [Co(SCN)_2]^0, which is the dithiocyanato complex, its concentration is:

β1 β2 [Co]_free [SCN]^2 → 9 *40 * [Co_free] * (0.1)^2.

Compute that:

9 *40 =360; [Co_free] is ~0.0001551. [SCN]^2 is 0.01.

So 360 * 0.0001551 *0.01 = 360 *0.000001551 = 0.00055836.

Wait, wait 360 * 0.0001551 = 0.055836. Multiply by 0.01 → 0.00055836 M.

Wait, but wait, let's compute each step:

[Co(SCN)_2] = β1 * β2 * [Co_free] * [SCN]^2 → 9 *40 * 0.0001551 * 0.1^2.

Let me compute each part:

9 *40 = 360.

0.0001551 * (0.1)^2 = 0.0001551 * 0.01 = 0.000001551.

360 * 0.000001551 ≈ 0.00055836 M.

Similarly, compute the concentration of each complex:

[CoSCN]^+ = β1 [Co_free] [SCN] → 9 *0.0001551 * 0.1 = 9 *0.00001551 = 0.00013959 M.

[Co(SCN)_2]^0 = 0.00055836 M.

[Co(SCN)_3]^- = β1 β2 β3 [Co_free] [SCN]^3 → 9*40*63 *0.0001551 * (0.1)^3.

Compute:

9*40=360; 360*63=22680.

(0.1)^3=0.001.

So 22680 * 0.0001551 *0.001 → 22680 * 0.0000001551 = ?

Wait, 22680 *1.551e-7 = approximately 3.512e-3 M? Wait, no:

Wait, 22680 *0.0000001551 = 22680 * 1.551e-7 = (22680 *1.551) *1e-7.

22680 *1.551 ≈ 22680 *1.5 =34020, 22680 *0.051= 1,157. So total approximately 35177. So 35177 *1e-7= 3.5177e-3 → ~0.003518 M.

Wait, that's 0.003518 M for [Co(SCN)_3]^-.

[Co(SCN)_4]^{2−} = β1 β2 β3 β4 [Co_free] [SCN]^4 →9*40*63*16 *0.0001551 * (0.1)^4.

Compute:

9*40=360; 360*63=22680; 22680*16=362,880.

[SCN]^4 = (0.1)^4 = 0.0001.

So 362880 *0.0001551 *0.0001.

Compute 362880 *0.0001551 = approx 362880 *0.0001 =36.288. 36.288 *0.0001551? Wait, no, wait: 0.0001551 is 1.551e-4.

Wait, 362880 *1.551e-4 = 362880 * 0.0001551.

Calculating:

362880 * 0.0001 =36.288.

362880 *0.0000551= ?

362880 *0.00005 =18.144.

362880 *0.0000051= approx 1.851.

So total 18.144 +1.851 =20. So total 36.288 +20=56.288.

Now multiply by 0.0001 (from [SCN]^4):

56.288 *0.0001= 0.0056288 M.

Wait, that's [Co(SCN)_4]^2− =0.0056288 M.

Now, let's sum up all the concentrations:

[Co]_free = ~0.0001551 M

[CoSCN]^+ = ~0.00013959 M

[Co(SCN)_2]^0 = ~0.00055836 M

[Co(SCN)_3]^- = ~0.003518 M

[Co(SCN)_4]^2− = ~0.0056288 M

Wait, let me sum these up:

0.0001551 + 0.00013959 = 0.00029469

+0.00055836 → 0.00085305

+0.003518 → 0.00437105

+0.0056288 → 0.010 (exactly 0.01000005, which is close to our total [Co] of 0.01 M. So that checks out.)

Now, the question is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex, which is [Co(SCN)_2]^0, the second complex. Its concentration is 0.00055836 M.

The total [Co] is 0.01 M. So the percentage is (0.00055836 / 0.01 ) * 100 =5.5836%.

Wait, that can't be right because none of the options are that low. The options are 16.9%, 25.6%, etc. Hmm, I must have made a mistake.

Wait, what did I do wrong here. Let me double-check the calculations.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in computing the terms. Let me recalculate the denominator.

Denominator terms:

Term 0: 1

Term 1: β1 * [SCN] =9 *0.1=0.9.

Term2: β1*β2 * [SCN]^2=9 *40 *0.01= 360 *0.01=3.6.

Term3: β1*β2*β3 * [SCN]^3=9*40*63 *0.001= 22680 *0.001=22.68.

Term4: β1*β2*β3*β4 * [SCN]^4=9*40*63*16 *0.0001=362880 *0.0001=36.288.

Adding all terms: 1 +0.9=1.9; +3.6=5.5; +22.68=28.18; +36.288=64.468.

So [Co]_free=0.01 /64.468 ≈ 0.0001551 M.

Now, [Co(SCN)_2]^0 = β1*β2 * [Co]_free * [SCN]^2 = 360 * 0.0001551 * 0.01.

360 *0.0001551=0.055836.

Multiply by 0.01 → 0.00055836 M.

So that's correct.

Wait, but the total is 0.01 M, and [Co(SCN)_2] is 0.00055836 M, so the fraction is 0.00055836 /0.01 = 0.055836 → 5.58%.

But the options don't have this value. So I must have made a mistake in the assumption about which complex is the blue one.

Wait, perhaps I mixed up the complexes—maybe the blue one is the [Co(SCN)_4]^2− complex, the tetrathiocyanato complex. Because I've heard that [Co(SCN)_4]^2− is blue, and [Co(SCN)_2]^0 is pink or something else.

If the question refers to the blue dithiocyanato complex, that would be [Co(SCN)_4]^2−, but that has four SCN- ligands. Wait, but the question says 'dithiocyanato', which implies two SCN- ligands. Hmm, maybe the naming is different.

Alternatively, maybe I have the stability constants wrong. Wait, perhaps the given β's are for the overall complexes, not stepwise.

Wait, if β_n is the overall stability constant for the nth complex, then for [Co(SCN)_1]^+, β1=9; [Co(SCN)_2]^0, β2=40; [Co(SCN)_3]^- , β3=63; [Co(SCN)_4]^2−, β4=16.

But that doesn't make sense because the stability should increase with each added ligand. But β4=16 is less than β3=63. So that can't be correct because the stability constant should increase with each added ligand. So the given β's must be stepwise.

Wait, perhaps I got the complexes wrong. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the stepwise β's are arranged such that each β is the step for adding an SCN- to the previous complex.

So the first complex, [CoSCN]^+, has β1=9.

The second complex, [Co(SCN)_2]^0, has β2=40. So the overall β for this is β1 * β2 =9*40=360.

Third complex, [Co(SCN)_3]^-: β3=63, so overall K3=9*40*63=22680.

Fourth complex, [Co(SCN)_4]^2−: β4=16, so K4=22680 *16=362,880.

So the overall K for the four complexes are 9, 360, 22680, 362880.

Wait, but that makes sense because each subsequent complex has a higher overall K, which means it's more stable.

So if the problem says the blue complex is [Co(SCN)_4]^2−, then we need to find the percentage for the fourth complex.

In my earlier calculation, [Co(SCN)_4]^2− was 0.0056288 M, which is about 56.288 mM.

So the percentage is (0.0056288 / 0.01)*100=56.288% → about 56.3%, which is not an option.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps I got the wrong complex.

Wait, maybe the question refers to the dithiocyanato complex as the one with two SCN- ligands, which is the second complex, and the calculation I did earlier gave it as 5.58% of the total, which isn't among the options. So I must have made a mistake in the approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the fraction using the formula where the denominator is the sum of all possible terms, including each complex's contribution.

Wait, another approach is to compute the fraction of each complex relative to the total.

The fraction f_n is given by:

f_n = (β_n [SCN]^n) / (sum_{k=0}^{4} β_k [SCN]^k )

Wait, but if β's are the stepwise constants, then the overall K for each complex is the product up to that n. So perhaps I should model it that way.

Wait, maybe the correct way is to compute each species' contribution as (β1 β2 ... βn) [SCN]^n, and sum all of these plus the free Co.

So the fractions would be:

f_n = (β1 β2 ... βn [SCN]^n) / (1 + β1 [SCN] + β1 β2 [SCN]^2 + β1 β2 β3 [SCN]^3 + β1 β2 β3 β4 [SCN]^4 )

So in this case, the denominator is the same as before, which was 64.468.

So for the second complex, n=2, the numerator is β1 β2 [SCN]^2 =9*40*(0.1)^2=360 *0.01=3.6.

So f2 =3.6 /64.468 → approx 0.05557 → 5.557%.

But that's the same as earlier, which is not matching any options.

Wait, but the options are all higher percentages. So perhaps I'm using the wrong approach.

Hmm, perhaps I should model [Co]_free as being very low, and the concentration of complexes as being much higher.

Wait, another approach: the problem might be simplified by assuming that the dominant species are the ones with the highest stability constants. So which complex has the highest K? The fourth complex has K4=362880, which is way higher than the others. So the majority of the Co would be in the fourth complex, but that's not matching any options, so perhaps that's not the case, or perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the [SCN-] is 0.1 M, but the [Co] is 0.01 M, so the ligand isn't in such high excess, and the free [SCN-] might not be approximated as 0.1 M.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to use the formation of each complex considering the stepwise β's and the given [SCN-].

Let me try a different approach using the log of the fraction.

The fraction of each complex can be found using the equation:

log(f_n / f_0) = n log([SCN^-]) + log(β_n)

where f_0 is the fraction of free Co^2+. But I'm not sure about this formula.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute the fraction for each complex using the formula:

f_n = (β1 β2 ... βn [SCN]^n) / (sum_{k=0}^4 (β1 ... βk) [SCN]^k )

So for each n, compute the numerator as the product up to n multiplied by [SCN]^n, and sum all the terms.

So let's compute each term in the numerator and denominator.

n=0: term is 1.

n=1: β1 [SCN] =9 *0.1=0.9.

n=2: β1 β2 [SCN]^2=9*40 *0.01=360 *0.01=3.6.

n=3: β1 β2 β3 [SCN]^3=9*40*63 *0.001=2268 *0.001=2.268.

n=4: β1 β2 β3 β4 [SCN]^4=9*40*63*16 *0.0001=362880 *0.0001=36.288.

So the sum of these terms is 1 +0.9 +3.6 +2.268 +36.288 = 44.056.

So the fraction for each complex is:

f0 = 1 /44.056 ≈0.0227 → 2.27%

f1=0.9/44.056≈0.0204 →2.04%

f2=3.6/44.056≈0.0817 →8.17%

f3=2.268/44.056≈0.0515 →5.15%

f4=36.288/44.056≈0.823 →82.3%

Now, adding these up: 2.27 +2.04=4.31 +8.17=12.48 +5.15=17.63 +82.3=99.93% → almost 100%, which makes sense.

Wait, but the sum is 44.056, so each fraction is (term)/44.056.

So the fractions are:

f0: ~2.27%

f1: ~2.04%

f2: ~8.17%

f3: ~5.15%

f4: ~82.3%

So the highest fraction is f4, which is 82.3%. But the question is about the blue dithiocyanato complex, which I thought was the second complex (n=2), but according to this, f2 is about 8.17%, which isn't matching any options. The options are 42.3%, 25.6%, etc.

Wait, perhaps the problem refers to the third complex as the blue one, or maybe I'm misunderstanding the complexes.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the stability constants are given in a different way. Maybe each β is the overall constant for the nth complex, not stepwise. So for example, β1=9 is the constant for [CoSCN]^+, β2=40 for [Co(SCN)_2]^0, etc.

In that case, the overall K for each complex is given, and the fractions can be calculated.

So the formula then would be:

f_n = (K_n [Co]_total) / ( [SCN]^n + sum_{k=0}^{4} K_k [Co]_total )

Wait, no, perhaps not. Let me think.

If K1=9 is the overall for [CoSCN]^+, then the fraction would be K1 [SCN] / (1 + K1 [SCN] + K2 [SCN]^2 + K3 [SCN]^3 + K4 [SCN]^4 )

But let's plug in the numbers:

[SCN]=0.1 M.

Compute each term:

Term0:1.

Term1: K1 [SCN] =9 *0.1=0.9.

Term2: K2 [SCN]^2=40 *0.01=0.4.

Term3:K3 [SCN]^3=63 *0.001=0.063.

Term4:K4 [SCN]^4=16 *0.0001=0.0016.

Sum all terms: 1 +0.9=1.9; +0.4=2.3; +0.063=2.363; +0.0016=2.3646.

So denominator is 2.3646.

Each fraction f_n is K_n [SCN]^n / sum.

So for n=2 (dithiocyanato complex), K2=40, [SCN]^2=0.01 → term=40 *0.01=0.4.

So f2=0.4 /2.3646 ≈0.169 → 16.9%.

Looking at the options, option D is 16.9%. So that's a possible answer.

Wait, but why is this approach different? Because in this scenario, each β is the overall K for the nth complex, not the stepwise. So with this approach, the dithiocyanato complex (n=2) has a fraction of ~16.9%, which matches option D.

But earlier, when treating the β's as stepwise, the f2 was about 5.5%. So which approach is correct?

Hmm, I'm a bit confused. The problem states the stability constants as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Typically, these are stepwise constants, meaning each β is the constant for adding one more ligand. But in this alternative approach, treating them as overall K's, I get a matching answer.

Wait, let me check which approach is correct. The general understanding is that βn is the stepwise stability constant. So when you form [Co(SCN)_n], the stepwise constant is beta_n = [ML_n]/([ML_{n-1}}][L]).

So the overall K for the nth complex is the product of the stepwise beta's from 1 to n.

So in that case, the earlier approach of calculating the fractions as the product of beta's (stepwise) up to n multiplied by [SCN]^n over the sum would be correct.

But in that case, the fraction for n=2 was around 5.5%, which doesn't match any options.

So perhaps the problem presents the beta's as the overall constants for each complex, not stepwise. So the correct approach would be to use each beta as K_n, and compute as I did in the alternative approach.

In that case, the fraction for n=2 would be 16.9%, which is option D.

But I'm not entirely confident because the problem says 'stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes'—which are typically stepwise. Hmm.

Wait, another check. If the stability constants are stepwise, then the fractions are as per the first approach, but if they're overall, then the second approach is correct.

Since the second approach yields an option that's present, perhaps that's the intended method.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake earlier in the first approach by not considering that the denominator should be sum of terms including the products of betas.

Wait, let me re-express the first approach correctly.

In the first approach, where beta's are stepwise, the denominator is Sum = 1 + β1 [SCN] + β1 β2 [SCN]^2 + β1 β2 β3 [SCN]^3 + β1 β2 β3 β4 [SCN]^4.

Which we computed as 64.468.

Then, [Co]_free = [Co]_total / Sum → 0.01 /64.468 ≈0.000155 M.

Then, the concentration of [Co(SCN)_2]^0 is β1 β2 [Co]_free [SCN]^2 → 9 *40 * 0.000155 * 0.01.

Which is 360 * 0.00000155 → 0.000558 M.

So the fraction is 0.000558 /0.01 =5.58%, which is not an option.

So perhaps the problem is intended to be solved using the second approach, where each beta is the overall K for the nth complex.

In that case, the sum is 2.3646, and the fraction for n=2 is 16.9%, which is option D.

But then why are the beta's presented as beta1=9, beta2=40, etc., which are much lower than the overall K for higher n?

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses the logarithms of the beta's.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the sum of all species where the complex has two or more SCN- ligands, but that's not clear.

Another possibility is that I made a mistake in calculating the denominator. Let me recompute the denominator when treating beta's as overall K's.

Wait, with beta1=9, beta2=40, beta3=63, beta4=16, then the terms are:

n=0:1

n=1:9 *0.1=0.9.

n=2:40*(0.1)^2=0.4.

n=3:63*(0.1)^3=0.063.

n=4:16*(0.1)^4=0.0016.

Sum: 1 +0.9=1.9 +0.4=2.3 +0.063=2.363 +0.0016=2.3646.

So the denominator is 2.3646.

The fraction for n=2 is 0.4 /2.3646 ≈0.169 → 16.9%, which is option D.

So I think this is the intended approach, considering each beta as the overall K for the nth complex.

But I'm a bit uncertain because normally, stability constants are stepwise. However, given the answer options, the correct approach seems to be the second one, leading to option D (16.9%).


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species, we analyze the given stability constants and concentrations. The problem provides the stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes as β₁ = 9, β₂ = 40, β₃ = 63, and β₄ = 16. The total cobalt concentration is 10⁻² M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. The blue dithiocyanato complex corresponds to the second complex, [Co(SCN)₂]⁰.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Interpretation of Stability Constants**:  
   The stability constants provided are interpreted as the **overall stability constants** for each complex, not the stepwise constants. This interpretation aligns with the problem setup and the given answer options.

2. **Fraction of Each Complex**:  
   The fraction of each complex is calculated using the formula:  
   \[
   f_n = \frac{\beta_n [\text{SCN}]^n}{\sum_{k=0}^{4} \beta_k [\text{SCN}]^k}
   \]  
   where \( \beta_k \) is the stability constant for the \( k \)-th complex, and \( [\text{SCN}] = 0.1 \, \text{M} \).

3. **Calculation of Terms**:  
   - For \( n = 0 \): \( \beta_0 = 1 \), term \( = 1 \).  
   - For \( n = 1 \): \( \beta_1 = 9 \), term \( = 9 \times 0.1 = 0.9 \).  
   - For \( n = 2 \): \( \beta_2 = 40 \), term \( = 40 \times (0.1)^2 = 0.4 \).  
   - For \( n = 3 \): \( \beta_3 = 63 \), term \( = 63 \times (0.1)^3 = 0.063 \).  
   - For \( n = 4 \): \( \beta_4 = 16 \), term \( = 16 \times (0.1)^4 = 0.0016 \).  

   The sum of all terms is:  
   \[
   \text{Sum} = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646
   \]

4. **Fraction of the Dithiocyanato Complex**:  
   The fraction of the second complex, [Co(SCN)₂]⁰, is:  
   \[
   f_2 = \frac{\text{Term for } n=2}{\text{Sum}} = \frac{0.4}{2.3646} \approx 0.169 \, \text{or} \, 16.9\%.
   \]

5. **Matching the Options**:  
   The calculated fraction of 16.9% matches **Option D**.

### Conclusion:
The percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species is **16.9%**.
