Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck. Let me try to work through it step by step. The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, so it probably forms a complex with calcium ions.

The problem says the solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Oh wait, I think "stoichiometric" means that the ratio is 1:1. So each Ca^2+ ion is bound by one EDTA^4- ion. Right, the formula for the complex would be something like Ca(EDTA) which is CaY^2- maybe, but I'm not entirely sure about the charge.

The pH is ideal, so I don't have to worry about the protonation states of EDTA. That simplifies things. The given K value is 5x10^10. I think that's the stability constant for the Ca-EDTA complex. The stability constant, K, tells us how stable the complex is. A higher K means a more stable complex, so the ions are less likely to dissociate.

So the key here is to find the concentration of free Ca^2+ ions in solution. The complex dissociates as CaY^2- ↔ Ca^2+ + EDTA^4-. But wait, EDTA is usually in different protonated forms depending on pH, right? Oh, but the problem says pH is ideal, so I can assume that the EDTA is in the right form to fully complex the Ca^2+. So the dissociation is going to be minimal because K is very large, meaning the complex is stable and doesn't dissociate much.

Wait, but wait. The K is 5e10, which is a very large number. So the reaction CaY^2- ↔ Ca^2+ + Y^4- has K = [Ca^2+][Y^4-]/[CaY^2-]. Since K is so big, the denominator [CaY^2-] is much smaller than the numerator, but wait, wait. Let me think again.

Wait, no. K is the product of the concentrations of the products divided by the reactants. So [Ca^2+][EDTA^4-] / [CaEDTA^2-] = K. Since K is so large, the denominator must be small. Which means that the concentration of the complex [CaEDTA^2-] is much smaller than the product of [Ca^2+][EDTA^4-]. But wait, the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. So, if the complex doesn't dissociate much, [CaEDTA^2-] ≈ 0.02 M. But that can't be because the K is so large. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, let's think. The complex is initially 0.02 M. If the K is large, that means the reaction favors the product side. So the complex dissociates a lot. But that's confusing because then [CaEDTA^2-] would be small. Wait, but if K is large, the concentration of the complex would be low because it's dissociating. But the initial concentration is 0.02 M of the complex. So perhaps the complex doesn't dissociate much, but that would mean that K is small, which it's not. I'm getting a bit tangled up here.

Wait, perhaps I should model this with the dissociation equation. Let me write it:

CaY^2- ↔ Ca^2+ + Y^4-

Let me let the change be x. So as the complex dissociates:

[CaY^2-] = 0.02 - x
[Ca^2+] = x
[Y^4-] = x

Wait, but wait. Under normal circumstances, EDTA exists in various protonated forms, and the Y^4- is the deprotonated form. But the problem states that the pH is ideal, so I assume that the EDTA is fully in the Y^4- form. So the concentration of Y^4- is equal to the concentration of Ca^2+ from the dissociation, which is x.

So the K expression is:

K = [Ca^2+][Y^4-]/[CaY^2-] = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x) = 5e10.

Because K is so large, the denominator (0.02 - x) must be much smaller than the numerator x^2. So x is much larger than 0.02, but that can't be because x can't be larger than 0.02 because the initial concentration is 0.02. Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this the wrong way.

Wait, no. Because if K is very large, the reaction favors the products. So the complex dissociates almost completely. So x would be approximately equal to 0.02, but that can't be because then [CaY^2-] would be zero, and K would be very large, which would lead to division by zero. That doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I should set up the equation correctly. Let's write it:

K = (x^2) / (0.02 - x) ≈ 5e10.

But if K is very large, 5e10, that suggests that the denominator is very small. So 0.02 - x must be approximately zero, but that's only possible if x ≈ 0.02. But then, substituting x=0.02 into the equation gives (0.02^2)/(0.02 - 0.02) = 4e-4 / 0, which is undefined. Hmm, perhaps I need another approach.

Wait, maybe I should consider that when K is very large, the dissociation is almost complete, so x is approximately equal to 0.02. But that can't be because the product would be (0.02)^2 / 0. So perhaps we can rearrange the equation.

Let me think: since K is very large, 5e10, the denominator 0.02 - x is very small. So 0.02 - x ≈ 0, meaning x ≈ 0.02. But wait, that would make the numerator x^2 ≈ (0.02)^2 = 4e-4. So then K ≈ 4e-4 / (0.02 - x) → but if x is ≈0.02, then 0.02 -x is near zero, making K very large, which fits. Wait, but here K is given as 5e10, which is very large. So perhaps I can approximate 0.02 -x as being negligible compared to 0.02. Let me see.

Wait, perhaps I should model it as K = x^2 / (0.02 - x) ≈ 5e10.

But if K is so large, and the denominator is small, then x must be very close to 0.02. Let me set x = 0.02 - y, where y is much smaller than 0.02.

So substituting:

x = 0.02 - y

Then the equation becomes:

K = ( (0.02 - y)^2 ) / y = 5e10.

Expanding numerator: (0.0004 - 0.04 y + y² ) / y = 5e10.

But since y is much smaller than 0.02, y² is negligible, and 0.04 y is much smaller than 0.0004. So the numerator is approximately 0.0004 / y = 5e10.

So 0.0004 / y = 5e10 → y = 0.0004 / (5e10) = 8e-15.

So y is 8e-15, which is much smaller than 0.02. So x = 0.02 - y ≈ 0.02.

But wait, that would imply that [Ca^2+] is approximately 0.02 M, but that can't be right because if the complex dissociates almost completely, then the concentration of Ca^2+ would be close to the initial concentration of the complex. But wait, the initial concentration is 0.02 M of the complex, so if it all dissociates, Ca^2+ would be 0.02 M. But the K is 5e10, which is a very large value, so the complex doesn't dissociate much. Wait, this is confusing.

Wait, no, wait. The stability constant K is large, meaning that the complex is very stable and doesn't dissociate much. So the concentration of Ca^2+ would be very low, because the complex holds onto the ions tightly. Therefore, the initial assumption was that x is much smaller than 0.02, so 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

So perhaps I should model it differently. Let's assume that x is much smaller than 0.02, which would make 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

So the equation becomes K ≈ (x^2) / 0.02 = 5e10.

So x^2 = 5e10 * 0.02 → 5e10 * 2e-2 = 1e9.

Wait, 5e10 * 0.02 is 5e10 * 2e-2 = (5 * 2) e^(10-2) )= 10e8 = 1e9.

So x^2 = 1e9 → x = sqrt(1e9) = 3.16e4 M? But that's impossible because the initial concentration is only 0.02 M. So that can't be right.

Wait, that can't be. I must have made a mistake in my approach. Let me think again.

Wait, I think I messed up the calculation. Wait, 5e10 * 0.02 is 5e10 * 2e-2 = 1e9. So x^2 = 1e9 → x = sqrt(1e9) = 31,622.7766 M. But that's way larger than 0.02 M, which isn't possible. So this suggests that our initial assumption that x is much smaller than 0.02 is wrong. So perhaps x is not negligible compared to 0.02.

Hmm. So maybe the correct approach is to let x be comparable to 0.02. Then I can't ignore x in the denominator. Let me set up the equation again without approximation.

K = x^2 / (0.02 - x) = 5e10.

Multiplying both sides by (0.02 - x):

x^2 = 5e10 * (0.02 - x)

Expanding the right side:

x^2 = 1e9 - 5e10 x.

Bring all terms to one side:

x^2 + 5e10 x - 1e9 = 0.

This is a quadratic equation in x. Let's write it as:

x² + (5e10) x - (1e9) = 0.

Using the quadratic formula:

x = [ -b ± sqrt(b² -4ac) ] / (2a)

Here, a=1, b=5e10, c= -1e9.

Discriminant D = (5e10)^2 - 4 * 1 * (-1e9) = 25e20 + 4e9 ≈ 25e20, since 4e9 is negligible in comparison.

So sqrt(D) ≈ 5e10.

So x ≈ [ -5e10 ± 5e10 ] / 2.

We can ignore the negative solution because x can't be negative. So:

x ≈ ( -5e10 +5e10 ) /2 → 0/2 = 0. That's not helpful. Alternatively, perhaps I should have considered only the positive sqrt.

Wait, no. Let me re-calculate the discriminant correctly. The equation is x² +5e10 x -1e9 = 0. So a=1, b=5e10, c=-1e9.

Discriminant D = (5e10)^2 -4 *1*(-1e9) = 25e20 +4e9 ≈ 25e20.

So sqrt(D) ≈5e10.

So x = [ -5e10 +5e10 ] / 2 → 0, or [ -5e10 -5e10 ] /2 → -5e10, which isn't possible.

Hmm, that suggests that the solution x is approximately zero, but that can't be right. Wait, maybe the quadratic approach isn't the best here.

Wait, perhaps I should reconsider the initial assumption. Let me think: if K is very large, the complex doesn't dissociate much, so x is small compared to 0.02. Wait, but earlier when I tried that, I ended up with an impossible x value.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the K expression. K = [Ca][EDTA]/[CaEDTA]. Since [Ca] = [EDTA] = x, and [CaEDTA] = 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

So K ≈ x² / 0.02 =5e10 → x^2 =5e10 *0.02 → 1e9 → x= sqrt(1e9)=3.16e4 M. But that's impossible because the solution can't have 3e4 M concentration when the initial was 0.02 M.

So that suggests that this approach isn't correct. So perhaps the assumption that x is much smaller than 0.02 is wrong. But then, how?

Wait, maybe I'm confusing the K expression. Let me double-check the formula for the stability constant. The stability constant, Kf, is defined as [Complex]/([Metal][Ligand]).

Wait, no, wait. Another possible confusion: sometimes, the stability constant is written as the reciprocal. Wait, no, the standard definition is that Kf is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. So for CaY^2- being formed from Ca^2+ and Y^4-:

Ca^2+ + Y^4- ↔ CaY^2-; Kf = [CaY^2-]/([Ca^2+][Y^4-]).

So in this problem, the K given is 5e10, which is Kf. So the equation would be Kf = [CaY^2-]/([Ca^2+][Y^4-]).

Wait, that's different from what I was thinking earlier. Oh! So I think I made a mistake in the K expression earlier. So let me correct that.

So, the correct K expression is:

Kf = [CaY^2-]/( [Ca^2+][Y^4-] )

Which can be rearranged as [Ca^2+] = [CaY^2-]/( Kf * [Y^4-] )

But wait, in solution, the total concentration of Y is the sum of free Y^4- and the complex. But wait, because EDTA is a polydentate ligand and usually exists in solution in various protonated forms, but the problem states that the pH is ideal, so perhaps Y^4- is the only form present. So [Y^4-] = [Y] = some concentration, but in the presence of the complex, it's [Y] = [Y^4-] = x.

Wait, but if the pH is ideal, maybe the EDTA is in a form that can act as a ligand, but perhaps the concentration of Y^4- is not x, but something else. Wait, perhaps I'm complicating this. Let me approach it again.

The initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Let's assume that the complex dissociates a little bit, releasing Ca^2+ and Y^4-.

So, at equilibrium:

[CaY^2-] = 0.02 - x

[Ca^2+] = x

[Y^4-] = x

Then the Kf expression is:

Kf = [CaY^2-]/( [Ca^2+][Y^4-] )

Substituting:

5e10 = (0.02 - x) / (x * x) = (0.02 - x)/(x²)

So,

5e10 = (0.02 - x) / x²

Multiply both sides by x²:

5e10 x² = 0.02 - x

Rearranging:

5e10 x² + x - 0.02 = 0.

This is a quadratic equation: a=5e10, b=1, c= -0.02.

Hmm, so solving this with the quadratic formula:

x = [ -b ± sqrt(b² -4ac) ]/(2a)

Plugging in the numbers:

b² = 1.

4ac = 4 *5e10 * (-0.02) = -4 *5e10 * 0.02 = -4e9.

So, discriminant D = 1 - (-4e9) = 1 +4e9 ≈4e9.

Square root of D is sqrt(4e9) = 2e4.5 ? Wait, 4e9 is 4 * 10^9, so sqrt(4e9)=2e4.5? Wait, sqrt(1e9)=3.16e4.5? Wait, wait, 1e9 is (1e4.5)^2 → because 1e4.5 is about 31623. So sqrt(4e9) is 2*31623=63246.

So,

x = [ -1 ± 63246 ]/(2 *5e10 )

We can ignore the negative solution because x can't be negative. So,

x = (63245) / (1e11) ≈ 6.3245e-7 M.

So approximately 6.3e-7 M. Looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M.

Wait, that makes sense. So the concentration of Ca^2+ is about 6.3e-7 M. That's much lower than the initial concentration of the complex, which is 0.02 M. So the complex doesn't dissociate much because the stability constant is so large, which aligns with intuition.

To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex, we use the stability constant \( K_f = 5 \times 10^{10} \). The dissociation of the complex can be represented as:

\[
\text{CaY}^{2-} \leftrightarrow \text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{Y}^{4-}
\]

Let the concentration of dissociated \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\) and \(\text{Y}^{4-}\) at equilibrium be \(x\). Then:

- \([\text{CaY}^{2-}] = 0.02 - x\),
- \([\text{Ca}^{2+}] = x\),
- \([\text{Y}^{4-}] = x\).

The stability constant expression is:

\[
K_f = \frac{[\text{CaY}^{2-}]}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{Y}^{4-}]}
\]

Substituting the equilibrium concentrations:

\[
K_f = \frac{0.02 - x}{x^2}
\]

Given \(K_f = 5 \times 10^{10}\), we solve:

\[
5 \times 10^{10} = \frac{0.02 - x}{x^2}
\]

Rearranging:

\[
5 \times 10^{10} x^2 + x - 0.02 = 0
\]

This is a quadratic equation of the form \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\), where:

- \(a = 5 \times 10^{10}\),
- \(b = 1\),
- \(c = -0.02\).

Using the quadratic formula:

\[
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
\]

Substitute the values:

\[
x = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{1^2 - 4(5 \times 10^{10})(-0.02)}}{2(5 \times 10^{10})}
\]

Simplify the discriminant:

\[
\sqrt{1 + 4 \times 5 \times 10^{10} \times 0.02} = \sqrt{1 + 4 \times 10^9} \approx \sqrt{4 \times 10^9} = 2 \times 10^4
\]

Thus:

\[
x = \frac{-1 + 2 \times 10^4}{2 \times 5 \times 10^{10}}
\]

\[
x = \frac{19999}{1 \times 10^{11}} \approx 1.9999 \times 10^{-7} \approx 2.0 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

Since \(x\) is small compared to 0.02, the approximation \([CaY^{2-}] \approx 0.02\) holds. Therefore, the concentration of \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\) is approximately \(6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}\), which matches option C.
