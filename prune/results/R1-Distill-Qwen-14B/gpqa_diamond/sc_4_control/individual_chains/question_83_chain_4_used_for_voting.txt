Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. Hmm, I need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. Let me think step by step.

First, I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base. When you titrate a weak acid with a strong base, the equivalence point is usually in the basic range because the salt formed (like sodium acetate) will hydrolyze in water.

The problem gives me the initial volume and concentration of acetic acid. So, I'll start by calculating the moles of acetic acid before dilution. Wait, the initial volume is 20.00 cm³, which is 0.020 liters. The concentration is 0.05 M. So moles = M x V = 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 moles. Right.

Then, we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. Oh wait, the total volume becomes 40 cm³ or 0.04 liters. So the new concentration is moles / total volume. 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Now, when we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH. The equivalence point occurs when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid. Let me compute that. Moles of acetic acid is 0.001. So moles of NaOH needed is also 0.001. The volume of NaOH needed would be moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 liters, which is 10 cm³. So at equivalence point, 10 cm³ of NaOH is added.

But the question is about 25% titration. So that's 25% of 10 cm³, which is 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added. Wait, no. Wait, no. If we're at 25% titration, does that mean 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized? So, moles of NaOH added would be 25% of 0.001, which is 0.00025 moles. Alternatively, maybe it's 25% of the equivalence point volume. Let me clarify.

Wait, the equivalence point is when all the acetic acid is neutralized. So 25% titration would mean 25% of the NaOH needed to reach equivalence is added. So the volume would be 2.5 cm³, as I thought before. So the moles of NaOH added are 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 moles.

So, during the titration, before the equivalence point, we have a buffer solution of acetic acid and its conjugate base. At 25% titration, 25% of the acid has been neutralized. So the buffer consists of some unreacted acetic acid and some acetate ions.

Let me calculate the concentrations. The total volume at 25% titration would be the initial acid volume plus the added NaOH volume. Initial acid is 20 cm³, and we added 2.5 cm³, so total volume is 22.5 cm³ or 0.0225 liters.

The moles of acetic acid initially were 0.001. After adding 0.00025 moles of NaOH, which reacts with acetic acid in a 1:1 ratio, the moles of acetic acid left are 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 moles. The moles of acetate ion formed are 0.00025 moles.

So, using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA]). The pKa is log(1.85e-5). Let me compute that. Log(1.85) is about 0.267, so pKa is 4.733. Wait, 1.85e-5 is 1.85 x10^-5, so pKa is about 4.733. 

So [A-] is 0.00025 / 0.0225 = 0.01111 M. [HA] is 0.00075 / 0.0225 = 0.03333 M. So the ratio [A-]/[HA] is (0.01111)/(0.03333) = 1/3 ≈ 0.333. Log(0.333) is about -0.477. So pH = 4.733 - 0.477 ≈ 4.256, which is approximately 4.26. Hmm, looking at the options, option A has 4.26 as the first value. 

Now, the equivalence point. At equivalence, all the acetic acid is neutralized to acetate. The solution is a solution of sodium acetate in water. Sodium acetate is a salt of a weak acid and strong base, so the solution will be basic.

The concentration of acetate ions can be calculated. The moles are 0.001 moles, and the total volume is initial 40 cm³ (20 +20) plus 10 cm³ NaOH added. Wait, wait. Wait, the initial acetic acid was diluted with 20 cm³ water, making 40 cm³. Then, during titration, we added 10 cm³ of NaOH at equivalence. So the total volume is 40 +10 =50 cm³, 0.05 L.

So the concentration of acetate is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M. Now, acetate is the conjugate base of acetic acid, so it will hydrolyze in water:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb for acetate is Kw / Ka = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) ≈5.405e-10. So Kb is about 5.405e-10.

The concentration is 0.02 M. Let's set up the expression. Let x be the [OH^-] produced.

Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-] ≈ x^2 / (0.02 - x). Since Kb is very small, x will be much smaller than 0.02, so we can approximate 0.02 -x ≈0.02.

So x² ≈ Kb *0.02 → x² ≈5.405e-10 *0.02 =1.081e-11 → x ≈ sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5.

So [OH^-] is ~1.04e-5 M. pOH = -log(1.04e-5) ≈ 4.98. So pH =14 -4.98≈9.02. Wait, but none of the options have 9.02. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 4.26;8.52 → nope, equivalence pH is 9.02, so not matching.

Option D: 4.57;6.92 → no, equivalence is around 9.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check.

Wait, wait: when I diluted the acetic acid, I think I messed up. Wait, the initial volume is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Diluting with 20 cm³ water makes 40 cm³. So concentration is 0.05 *20/(40) )=0.025 M, as I had earlier.

At equivalence point, you have added 10 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH. So moles of NaOH: 0.1 *0.010=0.001 moles. Which neutralizes all the acetic acid, producing 0.001 moles of acetate.

The total volume is 40 +10=50 cm³, 0.05 L. So acetate concentration is 0.001 /0.05=0.02 M.

Wait, using Kb again: Kb = Kw / Ka = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5)=5.405e-10.

So Kb =5.405e-10.

Set up the equation: Kb = x²/(0.02), so x² =5.405e-10 *0.02=1.081e-11 → x=1.04e-5.

[OH-]=1.04e-5 → pOH=4.98 → pH=14-4.98=9.02. Hmm, none of the options match that. So perhaps I made a mistake elsewhere.

Wait, maybe I should consider that when the solution is at equivalence, the acetate ion is in a solution that also has some sodium ions. But sodium ions are spectator ions, so they shouldn't affect the pH. So perhaps my calculation is correct, but the options don't have pH around 9. So maybe I messed up something else.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps I made a mistake in the volume. Let me check: initial volume after dilution is 40 cm³, adding 10 cm³ of NaOH gives 50 cm³. So acetate concentration is 0.002 moles? Wait, wait, no. Wait, initial moles of acetic acid were 0.001. So adding 0.001 moles of NaOH converts all the acetic acid to acetate. So moles of acetate are 0.001. So concentration is 0.001 /0.05 L =0.02 M. Oh, that's correct.

Wait, but perhaps the problem is that when you dilute the solution, the volume is 40 cm³, and then adding 2.5 cm³ for 25% titration. Wait, no, the 25% is of the equivalence point. So equivalence point volume is 10 cm³, so 25% is 2.5 cm³. So when I did 25% titration, the total volume was 20 +20 +2.5=42.5 cm³? Wait wait, no, wait. The initial solution after dilution is 40 cm³. Then, when adding 2.5 cm³ of NaOH, the total volume becomes 40 +2.5=42.5 cm³.

Wait, no. Let me get this straight. The initial solution is made by mixing 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20 cm³ of water. So the total volume is 40 cm³. Then, when you titrate with NaOH, each addition of NaOH adds to the volume. So at 25% titration, you add 2.5 cm³ of NaOH. So the total volume is 40 +2.5 =42.5 cm³.

Wait, but earlier I thought that at 25% titration, the moles of NaOH added are 0.00025. Let me recheck. The equivalence point is 10 cm³, so 25% of that is 2.5 cm³. So moles of NaOH =0.1 M * 0.0025 L =0.00025 moles. Which is correct.

So, the moles of acetic acid after reaction: 0.001 -0.00025=0.00075.

Moles of acetate: 0.00025.

So concentrations in 42.5 cm³ (0.0425 L):

[HA]=0.00075 /0.0425 ≈0.017647 M.

[A-]=0.00025 /0.0425≈0.005882 M.

Wait, wait, wait a second! I think I made a mistake here earlier. Because the total volume is 42.5 cm³, not 22.5 cm³. I see. Oh no, that changes the concentrations.

So [HA] is 0.00075 /0.0425 = 0.017647 M.

[A-] is 0.00025 /0.0425 ≈0.005882 M.

So the ratio [A-]/[HA] is (0.005882)/(0.017647) ≈0.3333. So same as before, the ratio is 1/3.

Wait, that's the same ratio as when the volume was 22.5 cm³. So the pH is still the same. Because Henderson-Hasselbalch depends on the ratio, not the actual concentrations. So the pH would still be pKa + log(1/3) =4.733 -0.477=4.256, which is about 4.26.

Hmm, so the 25% titration pH is 4.26, which matches option A's first value. But what about the equivalence point?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the pH at equivalence. Let me recheck.

At equivalence, all acetic acid becomes acetate. So, moles of acetate is 0.001, and volume is 50 cm³ (40+10). So concentration is 0.02 M. Then, Kb is 5.405e-10.

Setting up Kb = x²/(0.02) → x² =5.405e-10 *0.02=1.081e-11 → x=1.04e-5 → pOH=4.98 → pH=9.02.

But none of the options have 9.02. Let me look at the options again:

A) 4.26;8.52 → no.

B) 3.17;6.73 → no.

C)4.73;7.00 → no.

D)4.57;6.92 → no.

Hmm, none have pH around 9. So perhaps I made a mistake in the equivalence point calculation.

Wait, another approach: maybe the solution at equivalence isn't just acetate. Because when you dilute acetic acid with water, it's a weak acid, and when you add a strong base, you form the conjugate base. But perhaps I should consider that the solution is acetate in water, which is a base. So why isn't the pH around 9?

Wait, perhaps I messed up the Kb calculation. Let me recompute.

Ka=1.85e-5 → pKa≈4.733.

Kw=1e-14 → Kb=1e-14 /1.85e-5 ≈5.405e-10. That's correct.

So in a 0.02 M solution of acetate:

We can model it as CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

Kb=5.405e-10= [CH3COOH][OH^-]/[CH3COO^-]

Assuming x is [OH^-], then:

x²/(0.02 -x) =5.405e-10 → Since x is small, 0.02 >>x, so 0.02 -x ≈0.02.

x² ≈5.405e-10 *0.02 =1.081e-11 → x=sqrt(1.081e-11)= approx 1.04e-5 M. So [OH^-]=1.04e-5 → pOH=4.98 → pH=14-4.98=9.02.

Hmm, but none of the options have that. So perhaps the question has a mistake, or I made a mistake elsewhere.

Wait, let me think about the total volume again. Wait, maybe I forgot that the initial solution was diluted to 40 cm³, and during titration, when adding 10 cm³ of NaOH, the total volume is 50 cm³. So the concentration of acetate is 0.001 /0.05=0.02 M. So the earlier calculation was correct.

Wait, looking at the options again, maybe I made a mistake in the initial dilution. Let me recalculate the initial concentration.

Wait, initial volume is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then diluted with 20 cm³ water. So total volume is 40 cm³. So concentration is (0.05 M *20 cm³) /40 cm³ =0.025 M. Correct.

So moles of acetic acid after dilution: 0.025 M *0.04 L=0.001 moles. Correct.

So at equivalence point, we have 0.001 moles of acetate in 0.05 L, 0.02 M. Correct.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that the solution isn't just acetate. No, the sodium ion is a spectator, so it doesn't affect pH. So my calculation should be correct, but the options don't have a pH near 9. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the solution isn't as dilute as I thought. Wait, no, 0.02 M is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the pH using the exact expression without approximation.

So, Kb=5.405e-10.

Setting up the equation: x²/(0.02 -x) =5.405e-10.

Assume x is much smaller than 0.02, so 0.02 -x ≈0.02.

x²=5.405e-10 *0.02=1.081e-11 → x=1.04e-5.

Which is correct. So pH=9.02, but the options don't have that.

Hmm, so looking at the options, perhaps the values I'm getting don't match any. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, another approach. Maybe the equivalence point is not in the region I thought. Wait, wait, another thought: perhaps the problem considers the solution as weak base, but perhaps I should consider the hydrolysis correctly.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the solution's pH using another approach, like using the formula for weak bases.

Wait, maybe another approach: the pH at equivalence can also be calculated using the formula pH = ½ (pKa + pKw). Because for a weak acid and its conjugate base, the pH at equivalence is (pKa + pKw)/2. But wait, pKa is 4.73, pKw is 14. So (4.73 +14)/2=9.365. Which is higher than what I calculated earlier. But I got 9.02 earlier, which is lower than 9.365.

Wait, that doesn't make sense. Because the formula pH = (pKa + pKw)/2 is applicable when the salt is formed from a weak acid and strong base, but perhaps only under certain conditions.

Wait, maybe that formula is not correct. Let me think again. The pH at equivalence for a weak acid and strong base is determined by the Kb of the acetate ion. So perhaps my initial calculation is correct.

Hmm. Now, looking at the options again, perhaps the closest is option D: 4.57 and 6.92. No, that's not matching either.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the 25% titration pH.

Wait, alternative approach: perhaps when you dilute the acetic acid, the solution becomes weaker, so the pH is higher. Wait, but the initial pH before titration would be lower than pKa because it's a weak acid.

Wait, perhaps during the 25% titration, the pH is calculated correctly as 4.26, but the equivalence point is around 9.02, which is not among the options. So perhaps the correct answer is not in the options. But that can't be the case.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial dilution. Let me recheck:

Original acetic acid: 20 cm³ of 0.05 M. So moles = 0.05 *0.02 =0.001 mol.

Diluted with 20 cm³ water → total volume 40 cm³. So concentration is 0.001 /0.04 =0.025 M. Correct.

At 25% titration, 0.00025 moles of NaOH added. So moles of HA left: 0.001 -0.00025=0.00075. Moles of A-: 0.00025.

So in 42.5 cm³ (0.0425 L), [HA]=0.00075/0.0425≈0.017647 M. [A-]=0.00025/0.0425≈0.005882 M. Ratio [A-]/[HA}=0.333. So pH=pKa + log(1/3)=4.733 -0.477=4.256. So approximately 4.26. So option A's first value is correct.

But what about equivalence point. If the options don't have pH around 9, perhaps I'm wrong in the calculations.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that the volume at equivalence isn't 50 cm³. Let me think again. The initial solution is 40 cm³. Adding 10 cm³ of NaOH gives 50 cm³. So the acetate concentration is 0.001 /0.05=0.02 M. Correct.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate it without the approximation.

So, Kb=5.405e-10.

x²/(0.02 -x)=5.405e-10.

We can write x²=5.405e-10*(0.02 -x).

Assuming x is very small, 0.02-x ≈0.02, which gives x≈1.04e-5 as before.

But let's check the error. Let's suppose x is 1e-5, then 0.02-x≈0.019999, which is nearly 0.02. So the approximation holds.

So pH is 9.02, which isn't in any of the options. So perhaps I missed something.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that at equivalence point, the solution isn't just acetate. Wait, no, NaOH is a strong base, so all the acetic acid is neutralized to acetate.

Hmm. Maybe I should look for another way. Let me think about the given options.

Option D: 4.57;6.92.

Wait, if I got pH at 25% as 4.26 and equivalence as 9.02, but none of the options match, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the problem isn't about diluting the acetic acid before titration. Let me read the question again.

Question: We dilute 20.00 cm³ 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ water, then titrate the resulting solution with 0.1M NaOH. So the diluted solution is titrated.

So the initial setup is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the 25% titration is not 25% of the equivalence point volume, but 25% of the initial acid's concentration. No, the 25% is the fraction of the acid neutralized, so it's 25% of the equivalence point volume.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation but without considering activity coefficients, which might not change much at this concentration.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the question is asking for the pH at 25% of the equivalence point in terms of volume added, not in terms of moles. Wait, no, the 25% titration usually refers to the fraction of the acid neutralized, which is based on moles.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in the initial moles of acetic acid. Let me recheck: 20 cm³ of 0.05 M is 0.001 moles. Correct.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck. Let me look at the options again.

Option D: pH at 25% is 4.57, which is higher than my calculation. Maybe I messed up the ratio.

Wait, if the ratio [A-]/[HA} is (0.00025 /0.0425) / (0.00075 /0.0425) )= (0.00025)/(0.00075) = 1/3. So the ratio is same.

Hmm. So pH should be about 4.26, which is option A's first value.

But then the equivalence pH is 9.02, which isn't in the options. So perhaps the only option that starts with 4.26 is A, but the equivalence pH is 8.52, which is lower than what I calculated.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the equivalence point pH. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe I should compute the pH at equivalence point using the exact quadratic formula.

The equation is x²/(0.02 -x) =5.405e-10.

But if I don't make the approximation, x²=5.405e-10*(0.02 -x).

x²=1.081e-11 -5.405e-10 x.

x² +5.405e-10 x -1.081e-11=0.

Using quadratic formula: x = [-b ± sqrt(b² +4ac)]/(2a), where a=1, b=5.405e-10, c= -1.081e-11.

Discriminant D = (5.405e-10)^2 +4*1*1.081e-11.

Compute D: (5.405e-10)^2=2.921e-19. 4*1.081e-11=4.324e-11. So D=2.921e-19 +4.324e-11 ≈4.324e-11 (since 2.9e-19 is negligible). So sqrt(D)=sqrt(4.324e-11)= ~6.576e-6.

So x= [-5.405e-10 ±6.576e-6 ] /2.

The positive root is (6.576e-6 -5.405e-10)/2 ≈6.576e-6/2=3.288e-6.

So x≈3.288e-6 M.

[OH-]=3.288e-6 → pOH=5.486 → pH=14-5.486=8.514.

Oh! So pH≈8.51, which matches option A's second value of 8.52.

Wait, that's a big difference. So earlier approximation gave me pH 9.02, but the correct value without approximation is about 8.51.

So why the difference? Because the approximation 0.02 -x ≈0.02 isn't accurate when x is significant compared to 0.02. Wait, but when x is 3.288e-6, which is 3.288e-6 M, and initial concentration is 0.02 M, which is 2e-2 M. So 3.288e-6 is much smaller than 0.02. So the approximation should still hold. So why is there a discrepancy?

Ah, wait, maybe I made a mistake in the quadratic approach. Let me recalculate.

Wait, when I set up the quadratic equation, it's x² +5.405e-10 x -1.081e-11=0.

Wait, no, the equation is x² +5.405e-10 x -1.081e-11 =0.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the discriminant accurately.

b=5.405e-10, a=1, c= -1.081e-11.

b^2 = (5.405e-10)^2 = 2.921e-19.

4ac=4*1*(-1.081e-11)= -4.324e-11.

Wait, wait, no, the equation is x² + (5.405e-10)x -1.081e-11=0.

So a=1, b=5.405e-10, c= -1.081e-11.

So discriminant D= b² -4ac = (5.405e-10)^2 -4*(1)*(-1.081e-11).

Which is D=2.921e-19 +4.324e-11 = 4.324e-11 (since 2.921e-19 is negligible compared to 4.324e-11).

So sqrt(D)=sqrt(4.324e-11)= ~6.576e-6.

So x = [-5.405e-10 +6.576e-6 ] /2 = (6.576e-6 -5.405e-10)/2 ≈6.576e-6/2=3.288e-6.

So [OH^-]=3.288e-6 → pOH=5.486 → pH=8.514. So approximately 8.51. Rounded to two decimal places, 8.51.

Which matches the first option's second value of 8.52. So the pH at equivalence is around 8.51, which is option A's second value.

So the 25% titration pH is 4.26, and the equivalence pH is 8.52. So option A is correct.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we analyze the titration of diluted acetic acid with NaOH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. Here's the detailed breakdown:

---

### **Initial Setup**
1. **Dilution of Acetic Acid**:  
   - Initial volume of acetic acid = 20.00 cm³ = 0.020 L.  
   - Initial concentration of acetic acid = 0.05 M.  
   - Moles of acetic acid = \( 0.05 \times 0.020 = 0.001 \, \text{mol} \).  
   - After dilution with 20.00 cm³ of water, total volume = 40.00 cm³ = 0.040 L.  
   - New concentration of acetic acid = \( \frac{0.001}{0.040} = 0.025 \, \text{M} \).

2. **Titration with NaOH**:  
   - Concentration of NaOH = 0.1 M.  
   - At equivalence point, moles of NaOH required = moles of acetic acid = 0.001 mol.  
   - Volume of NaOH needed at equivalence point = \( \frac{0.001}{0.1} = 0.010 \, \text{L} = 10.00 \, \text{cm}^3 \).  
   - At 25% titration, 25% of the equivalence point volume is added:  
     \[
     \text{Volume of NaOH added} = 0.25 \times 10.00 = 2.50 \, \text{cm}^3.
     \]

---

### **25% Titration**
At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH, forming a buffer solution of acetic acid (\( \text{HA} \)) and acetate (\( \text{A}^- \)).

1. **Moles of Reactants**:  
   - Moles of acetic acid remaining = \( 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 \, \text{mol} \).  
   - Moles of acetate formed = \( 0.00025 \, \text{mol} \).

2. **Concentrations**:  
   - Total volume after adding 2.50 cm³ of NaOH = \( 40.00 + 2.50 = 42.50 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.0425 \, \text{L} \).  
   - Concentration of acetic acid:  
     \[
     [\text{HA}] = \frac{0.00075}{0.0425} \approx 0.0176 \, \text{M}.
     \]  
   - Concentration of acetate:  
     \[
     [\text{A}^-] = \frac{0.00025}{0.0425} \approx 0.0059 \, \text{M}.
     \]

3. **Henderson-Hasselbalch Equation**:  
   - \( \text{pKa} = -\log(1.85 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.733 \).  
   - \( \text{pH} = \text{pKa} + \log\left(\frac{[\text{A}^-]}{[\text{HA}]}\right) \).  
   - Ratio:  
     \[
     \frac{[\text{A}^-]}{[\text{HA}]} = \frac{0.0059}{0.0176} \approx 0.333.
     \]  
   - \( \text{pH} = 4.733 + \log(0.333) \approx 4.733 - 0.477 = 4.256 \).  
   - Rounded to two decimal places: \( \text{pH} \approx 4.26 \).

### **Equivalence Point**
At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to form acetate ions (\( \text{A}^- \)), which hydrolyze in water to produce a basic solution.

1. **Moles and Concentration**:  
   - Moles of acetate = 0.001 mol.  
   - Total volume = \( 40.00 + 10.00 = 50.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.050 \, \text{L} \).  
   - Concentration of acetate:  
     \[
     [\text{A}^-] = \frac{0.001}{0.050} = 0.020 \, \text{M}.
     \]

2. **Hydrolysis of Acetate**:  
   - The reaction is:  
     \[
     \text{A}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O} \leftrightarrow \text{HA} + \text{OH}^-.
     \]  
   - \( \text{K}_b = \frac{\text{K}_w}{\text{K}_a} = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.405 \times 10^{-10} \).  
   - Let \( [\text{OH}^-] = x \).  
     \[
     \text{K}_b = \frac{x^2}{[\text{A}^-] - x}.
     \]  
   - Assuming \( x \ll 0.020 \), approximate \( [\text{A}^-] - x \approx 0.020 \).  
     \[
     x^2 = \text{K}_b \cdot [\text{A}^-] = (5.405 \times 10^{-10})(0.020) = 1.081 \times 10^{-11}.
     \]  
     \[
     x = \sqrt{1.081 \times 10^{-11}} \approx 1.04 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{M}.
     \]  
   - \( [\text{OH}^-] = 1.04 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{M} \).  
   - \( \text{pOH} = -\log(1.04 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.98 \).  
   - \( \text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 4.98 = 9.02 \).  

   However, using the quadratic formula without approximation gives a slightly lower pH of approximately \( 8.52 \), which matches the closest option.

### **Final Answer**
- At 25% titration, \( \text{pH} \approx 4.26 \).  
- At equivalence point, \( \text{pH} \approx 8.52 \).  

Thus, the correct option is:
