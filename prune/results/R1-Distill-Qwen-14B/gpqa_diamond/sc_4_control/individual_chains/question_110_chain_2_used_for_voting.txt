Okay, so I've got this question about which stars can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, I need to figure this out. Let me read through the question carefully again.

So the key points: ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17, meaning V ≤17. HIRES can go down to V brighter than 16, so V ≤16. So both can detect stars up to 17 mag, but HIRES can go a little fainter, up to 16. Wait wait, wait. Wait, no. The question says "brighter than 17 mag" for ESPRESSO, which means stars with V ≤17 can be observed because brighter means lower magnitude. Similarly, HIRES can handle up to 16 mag. So, for a star to be detected by both, it's V mag must be ≤16, right? Wait, wait. Because if a star is brighter than 17 mag (like 16 mag), both can see it. If it's brighter than 16, then both can see it. But if a star is say 17, ESPRESSO can see it but HIRES can't, because HIRES only goes up to 16. So for a star to be detected by both, it needs to have V mag ≤16 mag. Wait, no wait—wait, the wording is "brighter than 17" for ESPRESSO. So if a star is 17 mag, it's equal to 17. So would that be detected? Or is it brighter, meaning less than 17? Because in astronomy, lower magnitude is brighter. So magnitude is a counterintuitive scale where lower numbers mean brighter. So if it's brighter than 17, that's magnitude less than 17. So if a star is V=17, it's not brighter than 17, so ESPRESSO can't observe it? Or is it including 17? The question says "brighter than 17 mag can be observed." Hmm, I think "brighter than" is exclusive. So if a star has V=17, it's not brighter than 17; it's equal. So ESPRESSO can observe V up to 17, but not beyond. So for detection by both, the star's V must be ≤16 because HIRES can only go up to 16. Wait, no, let me recheck.

The question says, for ESPRESSO, stars with apparent V brighter than 17 can be observed. So if the apparent magnitude is less than 17, which is brighter, ESPRESSO can see it. Similarly, for HIRES, stars with apparent V mag brighter than 16 can be observed, so apparent mag <16.

Wait, wait, the way it's phrased is, "brighter than [value] can be observed." So for example, if a star is V=16, it's brighter than 17 (since 16<17), so ESPRESSO can observe it. Similarly, V=15 is also more than 16 for HIRES. So the detectable range for each is: ESPRESSO can detect stars with apparent V mag <17, and HIRES can detect V mag <16. So for a star to be detected by both, it needs to have V mag <16—because if it's V=16.5, HIRES can't detect it. Wait, no, because HIRES can't handle above 16. So to be detected by both, the star's V must be less than 16. Because if it's 16.5, HIRES can't, but ESPRESSO can. But the question is which stars can be detected by both. So only stars with V <16 can be detected by both.

So now I need to look at each star and compute their apparent V magnitudes.

Let me go through each star:

Star1: Absolute V mag 15.5, distance 10 pc.

Apparent V mag is calculated using the formula m = M + 5 + 5 log10(d) [since d is in parsecs]. Wait, yes: m = M + 5 log10(d) + 5. So for d=10, log10(10)=1. So m=15.5 +5*1 +5=15.5+10=25.5? That can't be right. Wait, wait, no—wait, no, no, no, wait. Oh, wait, no. The formula is m = M +5 log10(d/10). Because the formula is m = M +5*(log10 (d) - 1), which is same as M +5*log10(d) -5. So for d=10 pc: log10(10)=1. So m=15.5 +5*(1) -5 = 15.5 +0=15.5. So apparent V magnitude is 15.5.

So Star1's apparent V is 15.5. That's less than 16, so both ESPRESSO and HIRES can detect it. Because 15.5 <16, so HIRES can; and 15.5 <17, so ESPRESSO can. So Star1 is detectable by both.

Star2: Apparent V magnitude is 16.5. Distance 5 pc. Well, wait, absolute magnitude is M, but wait, the question says Star2 has apparent V mag of 16.5. So no need to compute. So Star2's m is 16.5. So ESPRESSO can observe it (since 16.5 <17?), but HIRES can't, because HIRES needs m <16. So Star2 can be seen by ESPRESSO but not HIRES. So for the question, it's not a candidate.

Star3: Apparent V mag is 15.5. But wait, no. Wait, the question says Star3's apparent V magnitude is 15.5 mag, but with E(B-V)=0.6. Oh, wait, that's extinction. So the observed V magnitude is affected by extinction. So the observed m is actually m_observed = m_intrinsic + A_V. A_V is the absorption, which is E(B-V) * 3.1. So A_V=0.6 *3.1=1.86. So the observed V mag is m = 15.5 +1.86=17.36. So Star3's V mag is 17.36. So can ESPRESSO see it? Because it's 17.36, which is above 17. So ESPRESSO can't. HIRES requires m <16, so no. So Star3 is not detectable by either. Wait, but wait, the initial detection is based on apparent V mag. So if the star's intrinsic V is 15.5, but with extinction, it becomes 17.36. So the apparent magnitude is 17.36. So both ESPRESSO and HIRES can't detect it because HIRES requires V <16, which is not the case. So Star3 is not detectable.

Wait, but wait, I might have messed up. The question says for Star3, the apparent magnitude is 15.5, but E(B-V)=0.6. So wait, no. The apparent magnitude given is 15.5, but that's before extinction? Or is 15.5 the observed magnitude? The question says Star3's apparent V mag is 15.5, and E(B-V)=0.6. Wait, no, that can't be. Because if the apparent V is 15.5, but with extinction, it would be brighter, not fainter. Wait, no, wait: Extinction makes stars appear dimmer (higher magnitude). So if the apparent magnitude is measured as m = 15.5, but considering extinction, the actual intrinsic (without extinction) magnitude would be lower. Wait, this is getting a bit confusing.

Wait, the question says, for Star3: apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag, E(B-V) = 0.6. So wait, is the given m already corrected for extinction, or is it the observed magnitude which includes extinction?

In astronomy, typically, apparent magnitude refers to the observed magnitude, which includes extinction. So when a star's light passes through interstellar medium, it gets dimmed, so the observed (apparent) magnitude is higher than it would be without extinction.

So in this case, Star3's apparent V is 15.5, but with E(B-V)=0.6. Wait, but that's confusing because E(B-V) is the color excess, which is the observed (B-V) minus the intrinsic (B-V). So E(B-V) = (B-V)_{observed} - (B-V)_{intrinsic}. 

Wait, but how does that relate to the V magnitude? The total extinction A_V is related to E(B-V) via A_V = 3.1 * E(B-V). So for Star3, A_V = 3.1 *0.6=1.86. But how does that affect the V magnitude?

Wait, but if a star's true (intrinsic) V magnitude is m0, then the observed (apparent) V magnitude would be m = m0 + A_V. But wait, no. Wait, extinction makes the star appear dimmer, so the observed magnitude is higher. So if the star's true magnitude is m0, then the observed magnitude would be m = m0 + A_V.

Wait, but in the case of Star3, the apparent magnitude is given as 15.5, but that's the observed magnitude. So the intrinsic magnitude would be m0 = m - A_V = 15.5 -1.86 = 13.64. So that means, without extinction, the star would be at 13.64 mag. But in the question, Star3's apparent V magnitude is 15.5, which is the observed value. So when considering whether the instruments can detect it, we use the observed magnitude. Because the instruments can only see the observed light.

Wait, no, wait. No, wait. The problem is that the apparent magnitude is what the instrument measures. So for the instrument's detection, it's based on the apparent magnitude. So Star3's apparent magnitude is 15.5, but due to extinction, the star is actually brighter? Because the observed magnitude is higher (fainter) than the intrinsic. Wait, no, no, extinction makes the star appear dimmer, so the observed (apparent) magnitude is higher (brighter stars have lower magnitudes). So if the intrinsic apparent magnitude is 15.5, but with extinction, it would be 15.5 + A_V. Wait, no, I'm getting this mixed up.

Wait, let me think again. The formula for extinction is m_observed = m_intrinsic + A_V. Because extinction dims the star, making it appear fainter. So if the intrinsic (without extinction) apparent magnitude is m0, then the observed (with extinction) is m = m0 + A_V. So if Star3's m_observed is 15.5, then m0 = 15.5 - A_V = 15.5 -1.86=13.64. That's its intrinsic apparent magnitude. But that's confusing because apparent magnitude depends on distance. Wait, no, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, the way the problem is worded: Star3's apparent V magnitude is 15.5, and its E(B-V) is 0.6. So the observed V magnitude is 15.5 with extinction. But the actual intrinsic V magnitude would be lower. But for the purpose of the question, do we need to calculate the intrinsic V magnitude, or does the given apparent magnitude already include the extinction?

I think it's the latter. Because the question says the apparent V is 15.5, and E(B-V) is 0.6. So the observed star's V magnitude is 15.5 plus the extinction. Wait, no, wait, no. Wait, the observed apparent magnitude is 15.5, which is m_observed. The intrinsic apparent magnitude is m0 = m_observed - A_V. So m0 = 15.5 -1.86 = 13.64.

But how does that affect detection? The instruments detect based on the apparent magnitude, which is already the observed (fainter) value. So Star3's apparent V is 15.5. So for instruments, m=15.5.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me rephrase. For each star, I need to find their apparent V magnitude as observed, considering any extinction. Then check if m ≤16 for HIRES and m ≤17 for ESPRESSO.

So:

Star1: m=15.5 (no extinction mentioned), so m=15.5.

Star2: m=16.5 (apparent, no extinction).

Star3: m=15.5 (apparent) but with E(B-V)=0.6. So the observed m is 15.5 + extinction. Wait, no, because the extinction adds to the magnitude. So the observed m is m0 + A_V. So m_observed = m_intrinsic + A_V. But the question says Star3's apparent V magnitude is 15.5, which includes extinction. So m_observed is 15.5. So the actual apparent V without extinction would be 15.5 -1.86 =13.64, but I don't think that's relevant here. Because the instrument sees the observed magnitude, which is 15.5.

Wait, but wait. If a star's light is dimmed by extinction, its apparent magnitude increases (becomes fainter). So the observed apparent magnitude is m0 + A_V. So if Star3's intrinsic apparent magnitude is 13.64, but due to extinction, it appears as 15.5. So the m_observed is 15.5.

So for detection, the instrument only sees m=15.5. So for Star3, m=15.5. So both ESPRESSO and HIRES can observe it. Because 15.5 <16 and 15.5 <17.

Wait, but wait. The problem is that Star3's apparent magnitude is 15.5, but the extinction makes it dimmer than it is. Wait, no. The observed m is 15.5; the extinction is the reason why it's 15.5. So without extinction, it would have been m=15.5 -1.86=13.64, but that doesn't affect the detection. The instrument sees m=15.5.

So for Star3, m=15.5. So both spectrographs can detect it.

Wait, but this can’t be right because Star3's E(B-V) is 0.6, leading to A_V=1.86, which would make it appear 1.86 magnitudes fainter. So if the star's intrinsic m is 13.64, it would appear as 15.5. So from the instrument's perspective, it's m=15.5, which is within the detection limits of both?

Because both can detect up to 17 and 16, respectively.

Wait, but Star3's m is 15.5, which is below 16. So for detection, it is within HIRES's limit, and also within ESPRESSO's limit. So both can detect Star3.

Wait, but the question is which stars can be detected with both. So Star1 and Star3? Let's see.

Star4: Absolute V mag 15.5, distance 10 pc, E(B-V)=0.4. So first, compute apparent V mag without extinction, then add A_V.

m0 = M + 5 log10 (d) -5. Wait, M is 15.5, d=10. So log10(10)=1. So m0=15.5 +5*(1) -5 =15.5 +0=15.5.

Then, E(B-V)=0.4, so A_V=3.1 *0.4=1.24. So the observed m = m0 + A_V = 15.5 +1.24=16.74.

So Star4's apparent V mag is 16.74. So ESPRESSO can see it (since 16.74 <17?), wait, 16.74 is <17? Yes, because 16.74 is less than 17. So ESPRESSO can observe it. But HIRES requires m <16, so 16.74 is above that. So HIRES can't observe Star4. So only ESPRESSO can.

Star5: Absolute V mag 16.5, distance 5 pc. Compute apparent magnitude.

m0 = M +5 log10(d) -5. M=16.5, d=5. log10(5)= ~0.69897. So 5 *0.69897≈3.495.

So m0=16.5 +3.495 -5=16.5 + (-1.505)=14.995. Approximately 15.0.

But wait, also, Star5's E(B-V)=?

Wait, Star5's description didn't mention E(B-V). So no extinction. So the apparent magnitude is 15.0.

So Star5's m=15.0. So both ESPRESSO and HIRES can detect it, because 15.0 <16 and <17.

Wait, but let me confirm: m=15.0.

So Star5's m=15.0.

So which stars can be detected by both?

Let me make a table:

Star | Apparent V mag | Detectable by ESPRESSO (m <17) | Detectable by HIRES (m <16)
-----|---------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------
1 | 15.5 | Yes (15.5<17) | Yes (15.5<16)
2 |16.5 | Yes (16.5<17) | No (16.5>16)
3 |15.5 | Yes | Yes
4 |16.74 | Yes | No
5 |15.0 | Yes | Yes

Wait, but I might have made a mistake with Star3. Because earlier I thought Star3's m is 15.5. Let me recheck Star3's calculation.

Star3: Apparent V magnitude is 15.5 (observed). E(B-V)=0.6. So A_V=3.1 *0.6=1.86. So m_observed = m_intrinsic + A_V. So m_intrinsic = 15.5 -1.86=13.64. But that's the intrinsic apparent magnitude. But the observed m is 15.5. So the instrument sees m=15.5. So for detection, it's 15.5, which is acceptable for both ESPRESSO and HIRES.

Wait, but wait a moment—this would suggest that Star3 and Star5 can be detected by both. But looking back, the options don't include both. Let me look at the options:

Options:

A) Star4 and Star5

B) Star3 and Star5

C) Star2 and Star3

D) Star1 and Star4

So from the table, Star1 (m=15.5), Star3 (m=15.5), and Star5 (m=15.0) can be detected by both.

Wait, but Star3's m is 15.5, which is within both instruments' limits. So for both, Star1, Star3, and Star5 are detectable by both. But looking at the options, only option B includes Star3 and Star5. Option B is choice B: Star3 and Star5.

Wait, but wait. Looking back, Star3's m is 15.5. So both can detect it. Star5's m is 15.0, so both can detect it. So the stars that can be detected by both are Star1, Star3, Star5. But the options don't have an option that includes all three.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation for Star5. Let me recheck Star5.

Star5: M=16.5, d=5 pc.

Apparent magnitude without extinction: m = M + 5 log10(d) -5.

log10(5) ≈0.69897.

So 5 *0.69897 ≈3.495.

So m0=16.5 +3.495 -5= (16.5 -5) +3.495=11.5 +3.495=14.995≈15.0.

So yes, m=15.0. So Star5 is detectable by both.

So the stars detectable by both are Star1 (m=15.5), Star3 (m=15.5), and Star5 (m=15.0).

Looking at the options:

Option B is Star3 and Star5. So both can be detected by both. So that would be correct.

Option D is Star1 and Star4. Star1 is detectable by both, but Star4's m is 16.74, so only ESPRESSO can detect it.

So the correct answer must be B: Star3 and Star5.

Wait, but earlier I thought Star3's m is 15.5, which is acceptable, and Star5's m is 15.0, also acceptable.

So option B is the correct choice.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal and the HIRES spectrograph at Keck, we analyze the apparent V magnitudes of the stars and compare them to the detection limits of the instruments. ESPRESSO can detect stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 (i.e., $V < 17$), while HIRES can detect stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 16 (i.e., $V < 16$). For a star to be detectable by both instruments, its apparent V magnitude must satisfy $V < 16$.

### Analysis of Each Star:
1. **Star1**:  
   - Absolute V magnitude $M = 15.5$, distance $d = 10 \, \text{pc}$.  
   - Apparent V magnitude:  
     \[
     m = M + 5 \log_{10}(d) - 5 = 15.5 + 5 \log_{10}(10) - 5 = 15.5 + 5 - 5 = 15.5
     \]  
   - $m = 15.5$.  
   - Detection: $15.5 < 17$ (ESPRESSO) and $15.5 < 16$ (HIRES).  
   - **Star1 is detectable by both instruments**.

2. **Star2**:  
   - Apparent V magnitude $m = 16.5$.  
   - Detection: $16.5 < 17$ (ESPRESSO) and $16.5 \geq 16$ (HIRES).  
   - **Star2 is detectable only by ESPRESSO**.

3. **Star3**:  
   - Apparent V magnitude $m = 15.5$, with $E(B-V) = 0.6$.  
   - Extinction $A_V = 3.1 \cdot E(B-V) = 3.1 \cdot 0.6 = 1.86$.  
   - The observed apparent V magnitude is already given as $m = 15.5$, which includes the extinction.  
   - Detection: $15.5 < 17$ (ESPRESSO) and $15.5 < 16$ (HIRES).  
   - **Star3 is detectable by both instruments**.

4. **Star4**:  
   - Absolute V magnitude $M = 15.5$, distance $d = 10 \, \text{pc}$, with $E(B-V) = 0.4$.  
   - Apparent V magnitude without extinction:  
     \[
     m_0 = M + 5 \log_{10}(d) - 5 = 15.5 + 5 \log_{10}(10) - 5 = 15.5 + 5 - 5 = 15.5
     \]  
   - Extinction $A_V = 3.1 \cdot E(B-V) = 3.1 \cdot 0.4 = 1.24$.  
   - Observed apparent V magnitude:  
     \[
     m = m_0 + A_V = 15.5 + 1.24 = 16.74
     \]  
   - Detection: $16.74 < 17$ (ESPRESSO) and $16.74 \geq 16$ (HIRES).  
   - **Star4 is detectable only by ESPRESSO**.

5. **Star5**:  
   - Absolute V magnitude $M = 16.5$, distance $d = 5 \, \text{pc}$.  
   - Apparent V magnitude:  
     \[
     m = M + 5 \log_{10}(d) - 5 = 16.5 + 5 \log_{10}(5) - 5
     \]  
     Using $\log_{10}(5) \approx 0.69897$:  
     \[
     m = 16.5 + 5 \cdot 0.69897 - 5 = 16.5 + 3.49485 - 5 = 14.99485 \approx 15.0
     \]  
   - $m = 15.0$.  
   - Detection: $15.0 < 17$ (ESPRESSO) and $15.0 < 16$ (HIRES).  
   - **Star5 is detectable by both instruments**.

### Conclusion:
The stars that can be detected by both ESPRESSO and HIRES are **Star1, Star3, and Star5**. Among the given options, only **Star3 and Star5** are included in **Option B**. 

ANSWER: B
