Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The problem says we have a state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. So I think that means they form an orthonormal basis for the spin-1/2 system. 

The task is to calculate two things: first, the probabilities of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of a certain operator A, and then find the average value of that operator. The matrix representation of A is given as A_ij = ħ/2 if i≠j, and 0 otherwise. Hmm, wait, that's a 2x2 matrix, right?

Let me break this down. First, since the state is given as proportional, I should normalize it. The state |alpha> is probably (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>, but I need to find the normalization factor. The inner product of |alpha> with itself should be 1.

So the normalization factor squared would be the sum of the squared magnitudes of the coefficients. Let's calculate that: for (1+i), the magnitude squared is (1^2 +1^2)=2. For (2-i), it's (2^2 + (-1)^2)=5. So the total is 2 +5 =7. Hence, the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). So the state |alpha> is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2-i)/sqrt(7)|down>.

Next, the operator A. Its matrix elements are A_ij = ħ/2 if i≠j, 0 otherwise. So in a 2x2 matrix, that would be:

A = [ [0, ħ/2],
      [ħ/2, 0] ]

Wait, that's a matrix where the diagonal elements are zero and off-diagonal are ħ/2. So this is a Pauli matrix multiplied by ħ/2. Because the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], and if we multiply by ħ/2, we get A. So A must be (ħ/2) times the Pauli X matrix, which is the spin-flip operator.

The eigenstates of A are the eigenstates of the Pauli X matrix. The eigenstates are |+x> and |-x>, where |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and |-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2). So to find the probabilities, I need to express |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |-x>.

Alternatively, I can compute the overlap between |alpha> and each eigenstate of A, then the probability is the square of the absolute value of that overlap.

Let me proceed step by step.

First, write |alpha> as a vector. Since |up> is (1,0) and |down> is (0,1), |alpha> is a column vector [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2-i)/sqrt(7) ]^T.

The eigenstates of A are |+x> and |-x>, which in vector form are (1/sqrt(2))(1, 1) and (1/sqrt(2))(1, -1), respectively.

So the inner product of |alpha> with |+x> is:

⟨+x| alpha ⟩ = (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) * 1 + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) * 1 ] 
= (1/sqrt(2) sqrt(7)) [ (1+i) + (2 -i) ]
= (1/sqrt(14)) [3 + 0i]
= 3/sqrt(14)

So the probability P(+x) is |3/sqrt(14)|² = 9/(14) ≈ 0.6429.

Similarly, the inner product with |-x> is:

⟨-x| alpha ⟩ = (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) * 1 + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) * (-1) ]
= (1/sqrt(14)) [ (1+i) - (2 -i) ]
= (1/sqrt(14)) [ (1-2) + (i +i) ]
= (1/sqrt(14)) [ -1 + 2i ]
= (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14)

The absolute square is [(-1)^2 + (2)^2 ] /14 = (1 +4)/14 =5/14 ≈0.3571.

Wait, hold on, that's two probabilities adding to 9/14 +5/14 =14/14=1. So that makes sense.

So the probabilities are 9/14 ≈0.6429 and 5/14 ≈0.3571. So the closest options would be option A: 0.64 and 0.36.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is 0.64 and 0.36. So the probabilities are 9/14≈0.6429 and 5/14≈0.3571, which are approximately 0.64 and 0.36. So the first part of the answer is A, 0.64 and 0.36.

Now, the average value of operator A. The average value is ⟨alpha| A |alpha⟩.

Since A is a 2x2 matrix, let's compute this. Alternatively, since A is (ħ/2) σ_x, the average is (ħ/2) ⟨alpha| σ_x |alpha⟩.

The expectation value of σ_x can be found using the components of |alpha>.

In general, for a spin-1/2 system, ⟨σ_x⟩ = 2 Re( α* β ), where |alpha> is α|up> + β|down>, because σ_x has elements [[0,1],[1,0]]. So:

⟨σ_x⟩ = (α* β + β* α ) / (|α|² + |β|² )

Wait, no, more accurately, the expectation value of σ_x is ( α* β^* + β α^* ) / (|alpha|^2 + |beta|^2 )? Wait, no, I think I should compute it directly.

Let me write |alpha> as a vector [a, b]^T, where a = (1+i)/sqrt(7), b = (2 -i)/sqrt(7).

Then A = [[0, ħ/2],[ħ/2, 0]]

So ⟨alpha| A |alpha⟩ = a* (0) a + a* (ħ/2) b + b* (ħ/2) a + b* 0 b.

Wait, no. Matrix multiplication: ⟨alpha| is [a*, b*], multiplied by A |alpha> which is [0 a + (ħ/2) b, (ħ/2) a +0 b]^T. So the product is a*(ħ/2 b) + b*(ħ/2 a).

So:

= (ħ/2) ( a* b + b* a )

= (ħ/2) [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) * (2-i)/sqrt(7) + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) * (1 - i)/sqrt(7) )

Wait, because a is (1+i)/sqrt(7), so a* is (1-i)/sqrt(7). Similarly, b is (2 -i)/sqrt(7), so b* is (2 +i)/sqrt(7).

So a* b = [ (1 -i)(2 -i) ] /7.

Let me compute (1 - i)(2 - i) = 1*2 + 1*(-i) + (-i)*2 + (-i)(-i) = 2 -i -2i +i^2. Wait, i^2 is -1. So 2 -3i -1 = 1 -3i.

Similarly, b* a is (2 +i)(1 +i) = 2*1 +2*i +i*1 +i*i = 2 + 2i +i +i². i²=-1, so 2+3i -1=1+3i.

So a* b = (1 -3i)/7, and b* a = (1 +3i)/7.

So a* b + b* a = [ (1-3i) + (1+3i) ] /7 = (2)/7.

So ⟨alpha| A |alpha⟩ = (ħ/2) * (2/7) ) = ħ/(7).

Wait, so the average is ħ/7. So the first part gives probabilities of 9/14 and 5/14, which are approximately 0.64 and 0.36. The average is ħ/7.

Looking back at the options, option A says 0.64, 0.36, and ħ/7. So option A is correct.

Wait, but let's double-check the expectation value. Another approach is to note that A is (ħ/2) σ_x. The expectation value is (ħ/2) times the expectation of σ_x.

As |alpha> is a state in the z-basis, the expectation of σ_x can be found from the coefficients. The formula is:

⟨σ_x⟩ = ( |a|^2 - |b|^2 ) + 2 Re(a b^* )

Wait, wait, no, more accurately, for spin-1/2 systems, the expectation value of σ_x is given by:

⟨σ_x⟩ = ( |b|^2 - |a|^2 ) + (a b^* + a^* b )

Wait, perhaps I should use a better approach. The σ_x matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So when you compute ⟨alpha|σ_x|alpha⟩, that's a* * 0 * a + a* *1 * b + b* *1 * a + b* *0 * b.

Which is a* b + b* a.

Which is exactly what I calculated earlier. So that's 2 Re(a* b).

But a* is (1 -i)/sqrt(7), and b is (2 -i)/sqrt(7). So a* b = (1 -i)(2 -i)/(7).

Which is (2 -i -2i +i²)/7 = (2-3i -1)/7 = (1-3i)/7.

So the real part is 1/7. Therefore, a* b + b* a = 2*(1/7) = 2/7.

Hence, ⟨σ_x⟩ = 2/7. So ⟨A⟩ = (ħ/2) * (2/7) )= ħ/7.

So yes, the average is ħ/7. So the answer should be option A.

To solve the problem, we start by normalizing the given state \( |\alpha\rangle \), which is proportional to \( (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \). The normalization factor is determined by the sum of the squared magnitudes of the coefficients:  
\[
|1+i|^2 = 2, \quad |2-i|^2 = 5, \quad \text{so the total is } 2 + 5 = 7.
\]  
Thus, the normalized state is:  
\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} |\uparrow\rangle + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} |\downarrow\rangle.
\]

Next, the operator \( A \) is given with matrix elements \( A_{ij} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \) if \( i \neq j \), and \( A_{ij} = 0 \) otherwise. This corresponds to \( A = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_x \), where \( \sigma_x \) is the Pauli \( X \)-matrix. The eigenstates of \( A \) are the eigenstates of \( \sigma_x \), which are \( |+x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|\uparrow\rangle + |\downarrow\rangle) \) and \( |-x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|\uparrow\rangle - |\downarrow\rangle) \).

To find the probabilities of measuring the particle in \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \), we compute the overlaps:  
\[
\langle +x|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} \right) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{14}} (3) = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}},
\]  
\[
\langle -x|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} - \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} \right) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{14}} (-1 + 2i).
\]  
The probabilities are the squared magnitudes:  
\[
P(+x) = \left| \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}} \right|^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.6429, \quad P(-x) = \left| \frac{-1+2i}{\sqrt{14}} \right|^2 = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.3571.
\]  
These match the first two values in **Option A**: \( 0.64 \) and \( 0.36 \).

Finally, the average value of \( A \) is computed as:  
\[
\langle A \rangle = \langle \alpha | A | \alpha \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \langle \alpha | \sigma_x | \alpha \rangle.
\]  
Using the coefficients of \( |\alpha\rangle \), the expectation value of \( \sigma_x \) is:  
\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = \text{Re}(a^* b + b^* a),
\]  
where \( a = \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}}, b = \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} \). Calculating:  
\[
a^* b = \frac{(1-i)(2-i)}{7} = \frac{1-3i}{7}, \quad b^* a = \frac{(2+i)(1+i)}{7} = \frac{1+3i}{7}.
\]  
Thus:  
\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = \text{Re}(a^* b + b^* a) = \text{Re}\left(\frac{1-3i}{7} + \frac{1+3i}{7}\right) = \frac{2}{7}.
\]  
Therefore:  
\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \frac{2}{7} = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]  
This matches the third value in **Option A**: \( \frac{\hbar}{7} \).

**Final Answer:**  
The probabilities are \( 0.64 \) and \( 0.36 \), and the average value is \( \frac{\hbar}{7} \).
