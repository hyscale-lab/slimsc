Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to particle physics, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see, the question is about finding the mean decay distance of a meson resonance called X. The given parameters are the production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are A to D, each with different values.

Hmm, I remember that the mean decay distance is related to how long a particle lives before decaying. The formula I think I need involves the lifetime of the particle and the speed at which it's moving. Oh right, the mean lifetime τ is connected to the width Γ by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. The relation is τ = ħ / Γ, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant. 

Wait, but wait, I should double-check that. I think that the width Γ is related to the lifetime by Γ = ħ / τ. So τ is ħ divided by Γ. Yeah, that's right. Because a larger width means a shorter lifetime, which makes sense because a particle with a large width decays quickly.

So first, I'll calculate τ. Let me get the constants straight. The Planck constant ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. Oh wait, units are important here. Since Γ is given in MeV, I need to convert that to GeV. So Γ_X = 320 MeV = 0.32 GeV.

So τ = ħ / Γ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / 0.32 GeV. Let me compute that: 6.582e-25 / 0.32 ≈ 2.056875e-24 seconds. That's the lifetime.

Next, the mean decay distance is the product of the particle's velocity and its lifetime. So, the formula is L = v * τ. But wait, what's the velocity here? The particle X is produced with energy E_X =8 GeV, and its rest mass is m_X =1.2 GeV. So I need to find the velocity of the particle based on this energy.

I recall that the total energy E of a particle is given by E = γ m c², where γ is the Lorentz factor, m is the rest mass, and c is the speed of light. So to find γ, I can compute E / (m c²). But wait, let me make sure about the units. Since E and m are both in GeV, and c is in terms of units where c=1 in natural units, but I'll have to convert when calculating physical quantities.

Wait, so E is 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV/c². Because E = γ m c², so γ = E / (m c²) = (8 GeV) / (1.2 GeV) ) = 8/1.2 ≈ 6.6667. Because the GeV units cancel out (since m c² has units GeV when m is in GeV/c²). So γ is approximately 6.6667.

But wait, in natural units where c=1, E (in GeV) equals gamma * m (GeV/c²) * c² (in (GeV s²)/(m²)) )... Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Since I'm just looking for the velocity, I can use beta (β) as v/c. So β = v/c.

The relation between gamma and beta is γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - β²). So I can solve for β.

So γ = 6.6667, which is 20/3. Then, 1 - β² = 1/γ² = (3/20)^2 = 9/400. So β² = 1 - 9/400 = (400 -9)/400 = 391/400. So β = sqrt(391/400) = sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887. So v ≈ 0.9887c. That's a high speed, close to the speed of light.

So the velocity v is approximately 0.9887 times the speed of light. But let me compute it more accurately. Wait, sqrt(391) is approximately sqrt(391) ≈ 19.774, since 19² is 361, 20² is 400, so 19.774² is around 391. So beta is 19.774 / 20 ≈ 0.9887, so v = 0.9887c.

Now, the distance L is v * τ. Let's compute that. But wait, the units need to be consistent. Let's make sure all units are in meters and seconds.

τ is in seconds, v is in terms of c, which is m/s. So c is approximately 3e8 m/s. So v = 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s ≈ 2.9661e8 m/s.

So L = v * τ = (2.9661e8 m/s) * (2.056875e-24 s) = approximately 2.9661e8 * 2.056875e-24.

Let me compute that. Multiply 2.9661e8 by 2.056875e-24. Let's see:

2.9661 * 2.056875 ≈ let's compute 3 * 2.056875 is about 6.170625, but since 2.9661 is a bit less than 3, maybe around 6.1 (exact computation: 2.9661 * 2.056875).

Wait, 2 * 2.056875 = 4.11375, 0.9661 * 2.056875 ≈ Let's compute 0.9661 * 2.056875:

0.9 * 2.056875 = 1.8511875
0.06 * 2.056875 = 0.1234125
0.0061 * 2.056875 ≈ ~0.01255
Adding: 1.8511875 + 0.1234125 = 1.9746 + 0.01255 ≈ 1.98715. So total is 4.11375 + 1.98715 = 6.0999. So approximately 6.1.

So 6.1 multiplied by 1e8 * 1e-24 = 1e-16. So L ≈ 6.1e-16 meters.

Wait, but wait, let me use a calculator approach.

2.9661e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = (2.9661 * 2.056875) * 1e8 * 1e-24.

Compute 2.9661 * 2.056875:

Let me compute it precisely:

2 * 2 =4.

But let me do 2.9661 * 2.056875:

Break it down:

= 2 * 2.056875 = 4.11375
+ 0.9661 * 2.056875.

Compute 0.9661 * 2.056875:

Let me compute 0.9661 *2 =1.9322, 0.9661 *0.056875=approx 0.055198.

So 1.9322 + 0.055198 =1.987398.

So total is 4.11375 + 1.987398 ≈ 6.099148.

So 6.099e-16 meters? Because 1e8 * 1e-24 = 1e-16.

So L ≈ 6.099e-16 meters.

Hmm, looking at the options: A)5.0223e-16, B)4.0655e-15, C)5.0223e-15, D)4.0655e-16.

Wait, wait, my calculation says about 6e-16 m, but none of the options are close to that. So perhaps I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, maybe I messed up the calculation of gamma. Let me double-check the gamma calculation.

E_X =8 GeV, m_X=1.2 GeV/c².

So gamma is E/(m c²). Since E is given in GeV, and m is in GeV/c², then E/(m c²) is GeV / (GeV/c² * c²) )= GeV/(GeV) )= unitless. So yes, gamma =8 /1.2=6.6667.

Wait, but maybe I should compute the velocity beta more accurately.

Beta = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma²)).

So 1/gamma² = (3/20)^2 =9/400 =0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225=0.9775. So sqrt(0.9775)= approx 0.9887. That's correct.

So velocity is v=beta c ≈0.9887 *3e8 m/s ≈2.966e8 m/s.

Then, the lifetime is tau = hbar / Gamma.

Hbar is 6.582e-25 GeV·s. Gamma is 0.32 GeV. So tau=6.582e-25 /0.32 ≈2.056875e-24 s.

So L = v * tau = (2.966e8 m/s) * (2.056875e-24 s) =6.103e-16 meters.

But this isn't matching any of the options. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in computing gamma. Because E is the total energy, but when a particle is produced, it's moving, but maybe the energy given is the total energy, which includes the rest mass. So gamma is indeed E/(m c²) =8/(1.2)=6.6667, which is correct.

Wait, but another possibility: the mean decay length is calculated as (c * tau) * beta gamma. Wait, wait, another approach. Because lifetime is tau, and the particle's speed is v = beta c. So the distance is v * tau = beta c tau. But another formula I've heard is L = c * tau * beta gamma, but that can't be because beta gamma is a factor that comes into play for other things.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the decay length formula. Let me recall, the mean path is L = c τ (β γ).

Wait, that's a possibility. Because sometimes, the mean path is given by L = c * tau * beta gamma.

Wait, because the lifetime as measured in the lab frame is longer than the proper lifetime. So perhaps the lifetime in the lab frame is gamma * tau_0, where tau_0 is the proper lifetime (the lifetime in the particle's rest frame). So tau = gamma tau_0.

But in this case, I think tau is already the lifetime as measured in the lab frame, because in the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, the width is measured in the lab frame. Or is it? Hmm, perhaps I'm confusing things.

Wait, the lifetime measured in the lab frame is tau = gamma tau_0, where tau_0 is the proper lifetime (the lifetime in the particle's rest frame). So tau_0 = tau / gamma.

But the decay width is related to tau_0 by Gamma = hbar / tau_0. So Gamma = hbar gamma / tau.

Wait, no. Let's think again. The uncertainty principle says Gamma * tau >= ħ. So Gamma is the total decay width, which is the same in all frames, right? Because it's a property of the particle.

Wait, no, I'm getting confused. The width Γ is frame-dependent? Or is it a Lorentz invariant quantity?

Hmm, maybe Γ is the same in all frames. Because Γ is the width of the resonance, which is a Lorentz-invariant quantity. So the lifetime in the rest frame is tau_0 = ħ / Gamma. And the lifetime in the lab frame is tau = gamma tau_0 = gamma ħ / Gamma.

Wait, that makes sense because the particle's lifetime is longer when it's moving faster (gamma increases). So the decay length is v * tau = beta c * gamma tau_0.

Wait, no, if tau_0 is the proper lifetime, then tau = gamma tau_0. So L = beta c tau = beta c gamma tau_0.

But wait, tau_0 is ħ / Gamma, so L = beta c gamma (ħ / Gamma).

Wait, but ħ is 6.582e-25 GeV s. So let me write L = beta c gamma (6.582e-25 GeV s) / (Gamma in GeV).

Wait, Gamma is 0.32 GeV.

So let's compute this:

L = beta * c * gamma * (6.582e-25 GeV s) / (0.32 GeV).

The GeV cancels out, so:

L = beta * c * gamma * (6.582e-25 s) / 0.32.

Let me compute each term.

Gamma is 6.6667, beta is 0.9887.

So: 6.6667 * 0.9887 ≈6.6667 * 0.9887 ≈ approx 6.6 (exact: 6.6667 *0.9887 → let's calculate 6*0.9887=5.9322, 0.6667 *0.9887≈0.658, so total about 6.5902).

So approximately 6.59.

So then:

L ≈6.59 * c * (6.582e-25 s) / 0.32.

Wait, no, wait, the equation is:

L = (beta * gamma) * (c * tau_0) ≈ beta gamma * (c * (ħ / Gamma))).

But perhaps I should compute it as:

L = beta * gamma * c * tau_0.

But tau_0 is ħ/(Gamma).

So L = beta * gamma * c * (ħ / Gamma).

So substituting the numbers:

beta=0.9887, gamma=6.6667, c=3e8 m/s, ħ=6.582e-25 GeV s, Gamma=0.32 GeV.

So L = 0.9887 *6.6667 *3e8 m/s * (6.582e-25 GeV s / 0.32 GeV).

Let me compute step by step.

First, 0.9887 *6.6667 ≈ 6.5908.

Then, 3e8 m/s multiplied by 6.5908 is 3e8 *6.5908 ≈1.977e9 m/s.

Then, 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = 2.056875e-24 s.

Now, multiply all together:

1.977e9 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = 1.977 * 2.056875e-15 m.

1.977 * 2.056875 ≈ let's compute:

2 *2.056875 =4.11375, but 1.977 is a little less than 2. So 1.977 *2.056875 ≈ about 4.065.

So L ≈4.065e-15 m.

Wait, but wait, because 1.977e9 *2.056875e-24 = (1.977 * 2.056875) * 1e9 *1e-24 = (about 4.065) * 1e-15 m.

So approximately 4.065e-15 meters.

Looking back at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, and option D is 4.0655e-16 m.

So the correct answer should be option B: 4.0655e-15 m.

Wait, but earlier I thought my initial approach gave 6e-16 m, but that didn't match any options. But with this second approach using beta gamma and considering the proper lifetime, I get 4.065e-15, which is option B.

So where did I go wrong in the first approach? Oh, I think I messed up the units in the first method. Let me check.

In the first approach, I computed tau as (6.582e-25 GeV s)/(0.32 GeV) =2.056e-24 s.

Then, L = v * tau = (0.9887 *3e8 m/s) * 2.056e-24 s.

Which is 2.966e8 m/s * 2.056e-24 s = (2.966 *2.056) e-16 meters.

2.966 *2.056 ≈6.1, so 6.1e-16 m, which isn't any of the options.

But that approach seems to neglect the gamma factor correctly. So why the discrepancy? Because the first approach didn't account for the fact that the lifetime is already gamma multiplied by the proper lifetime. Or perhaps, because I confused the proper lifetime with the lab frame lifetime.

Wait, in the first approach, I used tau = ħ / Gamma, which is the proper lifetime (tau_0). But in the lab frame, the lifetime is longer: tau = gamma tau_0.

So in the first approach, I computed tau as the proper lifetime, but when calculating L, I should have used the lab frame lifetime, which is gamma times longer.

Wait, no. Because in the Heisenberg uncertainty, the width is the same in all frames, so Gamma is the same. Therefore, tau_0 = ħ / Gamma. But in the lab frame, the lifetime is tau = gamma tau_0. So the correct tau to use is gamma tau_0, not tau_0.

Ah! So that's where I made the mistake. So the first approach mistakenly used tau_0 as the lifetime, but the correct tau is gamma tau_0.

So in the first calculation, I should have used tau = gamma * tau_0 = gamma * (ħ / Gamma).

So let me redo the first approach correctly.

tau = gamma * (ħ / Gamma) = 6.6667 * (6.582e-25 / 0.32).

Compute that: 6.6667 * (2.056875e-24) = 1.371e-23 s.

Wait, no: 6.6667 * 2.056875e-24 = approx 1.371e-23 s.

Wait, 6.6667 * 2.056875e-24 = 2.056875e-24 * (20/3) ≈ (2.056875 * 20)/3 )e-24.

2.056875 *20 =41.1375. Divided by 3: ≈13.7125e-24 →1.37125e-23 s.

So tau =1.37125e-23 s.

Then, L = v * tau = (0.9887 *3e8 m/s) * 1.37125e-23 s.

Compute that: 0.9887 *3e8 =2.9661e8 m/s.

So 2.9661e8 m/s * 1.37125e-23 s = 2.9661 * 1.37125e-15 m.

Multiply 2.9661 *1.37125:

Let me compute 3 *1.37125 =4.11375, but since 2.9661 is a bit less than 3, about 4.065.

So L ≈4.065e-15 m.

Which matches option B: 4.0655e-15 m.

So that's the correct approach. So the initial mistake was using tau_0 instead of tau in the first calculation. Now, with the corrected approach, the result is option B.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the mean decay distance of the meson resonance \( X \), we use the formula for the decay length:

\[
L = v \tau
\]

where \( v \) is the particle's velocity and \( \tau \) is its lifetime in the lab frame. The lifetime \( \tau \) is related to the decay width \( \Gamma \) by:

\[
\tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma}
\]

Additionally, the velocity \( v \) is determined using the total energy \( E_X \) and the rest mass \( m_X \). The Lorentz factor \( \gamma \) is given by:

\[
\gamma = \frac{E_X}{m_X c^2}
\]

Since \( c = 1 \) in natural units, \( \gamma = \frac{E_X}{m_X} = \frac{8 \, \text{GeV}}{1.2 \, \text{GeV}} = 6.6667 \). The velocity \( v \) is then expressed as:

\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}}, \quad v = \beta c
\]

Substituting \( \gamma = 6.6667 \), we find:

\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{(6.6667)^2}} = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{44.444}} = \sqrt{0.9775} \approx 0.9887
\]

Thus, \( v \approx 0.9887c \), or \( v \approx 0.9887 \times 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \approx 2.9661 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \).

The decay width \( \Gamma \) is given as \( 320 \, \text{MeV} = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \). Using \( \hbar = 6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV·s} \), the lifetime \( \tau \) is:

\[
\tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma} = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV·s}}{0.32 \, \text{GeV}} \approx 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}
\]

However, the lifetime in the lab frame is extended by the Lorentz factor \( \gamma \), so:

\[
\tau_{\text{lab}} = \gamma \tau = 6.6667 \times 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s} \approx 1.37125 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{s}
\]

Finally, the mean decay distance is:

\[
L = v \tau_{\text{lab}} = (2.9661 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}) \times (1.37125 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{s}) \approx 4.065 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}
\]

This matches option **B**. The initial discrepancy arose because the first calculation used the proper lifetime \( \tau_0 \) instead of the lab-frame lifetime \( \tau_{\text{lab}} \), which accounts for the Lorentz factor \( \gamma \).

**Answer: B**
