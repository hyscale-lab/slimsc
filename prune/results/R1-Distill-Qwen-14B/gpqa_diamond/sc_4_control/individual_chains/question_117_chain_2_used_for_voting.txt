Okay, so I've got this question about optical isomerism in organic compounds. Hmm, optical isomerism refers to compounds that are mirror images of each other and can't be superimposed. These are also called enantiomers. So, I need to figure out which of the given compounds can exhibit this property.

The question lists four compounds and asks which show optical isomerism. The options are A, B, C, D, each combining some of the four compounds.

Let me go through each one by one.

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Biphenyl structures can have stereoisomerism if there's a possibility of the substituents being in different spatial arrangements. Biphenyls can have what's called a diastereomeric relationship due to the rotation around the central bond. But wait, is that correct? I think for a biphenyl to have stereoisomers, the substituents need to be in positions that make the molecule chiral. Let's see, the substituents here are at 2 and 2' positions, and 6 and 6' as well. Wait, but if the biphenyl is 1,1', then the substituents are on each ring, but I'm trying to see if there's a plane of symmetry. If the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it won't be chiral. If the substituents are in positions that prevent a plane of symmetry, then it could be chiral.

Wait, the substituents are at 2,2' and 6,6'. So the molecule is symmetrical across the central bond. Because 2 and 2' are mirror images when the biphenyl is rotated. Similarly, 6 and 6' would be opposite. So maybe this molecule isn't chiral. Because the substituents are on both rings in a symmetrical fashion. Alternatively, maybe when you have the substituents in such a way that there's no plane of symmetry, the molecule can be chiral.

Wait, another thought: Fumaric acid is a diastereomer of maleic acid, and their esters can have stereoisomerism. Hmm, but that's another compound—number 4 is dimethyl fumarate, which I'll get to later.

Back to number 1. Let me visualize the structure. Two benzene rings connected by a single bond at positions 1 and 1'. On each ring, at positions 2 and 6, there are substituents. The substituents are COOCH3 groups at 2 and 2', and NO2 at 6 and 6'. Wait, so each benzene ring has a COOCH3 at 2 and a NO2 at 6. So each ring has two substituents. So when you look at the two rings, each has the same substituents, but their positions relative to each other might affect the symmetry.

Wait, but if the substituents on each ring are in positions that are symmetrically opposite, perhaps the whole molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. For instance, if each ring has a COOCH3 at position 2 and a NO2 at position 6, but the orientation of these groups on each ring might be such that the molecule as a whole is symmetric. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are arranged in a way that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, leading to chirality.

I'm a bit confused about this one. Let me think: in biphenyls, if the substituents on each ring are arranged in a way that they are not mirror images, then the molecule can be chiral. For example, if one substituent is up on one ring and down on the other, but if the molecule can't be superimposed on its mirror image, then it's chiral. Alternatively, if the substituents are such that the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it won't be chiral.

Wait, another approach: if the substituents are in the same positions on each ring, but their arrangement leads to the molecule having a plane of symmetry, then it's not chiral. Alternatively, if the substituents are arranged so that the molecule isn't symmetric, then perhaps it's chiral.

Alternatively, maybe the molecule has a center of symmetry. For example, if each substituent on the left ring is mirrored on the right ring, then the molecule has a center of symmetry, making it achiral.

Wait, I'm not sure. Maybe it's better to come back to this after I think about the other compounds.

2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Let's draw the structure. 2-Hydroxypropanoate is CH3-C(OH)O-COOCH3? Wait, no, wait. The formula is OHC-CH2-COOCH3? No, wait. Propanoate would be CH2CH2COO- but with a hydroxyl group on carbon 2.

Wait, the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3? No, wait: 2-hydroxypropanoate. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO- but with the hydroxyl on the second carbon. So it's CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3. Wait, I'm getting a bit mixed up.

Wait, propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. 2-hydroxypropanoate would be HOCH2CH2COOCH3? No, wait: propanoate is CH3CH2COO-, so 2-hydroxy would be on the middle carbon. So the structure is CH3-CHOH-COOCH3. Hmm, no, that can't be right because that would be 3-hydroxypropanoate. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think: propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. The three carbons are 1, 2, 3. 2-hydroxypropanoate would be HO-CH2-COOCH3? No, wait, no: propanoate is CH2CH2COO-, so the positions are 1, 2, 3 as CH3-CH2-COO-. So 2-hydroxy would be on the CH2, making it CH2OH-CH2-COO- when deprotonated. But in the ester form, it's methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, which would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me think again. The structure of 2-hydroxypropanoate would be:

The carboxylic acid is propanoic acid: CH3CH2COOH. The 2-hydroxy version would be CH2(OH)CH2COOH. But wait, that's impossible because the molecule would have HO-CH2-CH2-COOH. But wait, that's 3-hydroxypropanoic acid, because the COOH is on carbon 3. Wait, no, wait, maybe numbering is different.

Wait, maybe it's better to think of the ester. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: the acid is 2-hydroxypropanoic acid, which is (CH3CO)CH(OH)COOCH3? No, that can't be. Alternatively, perhaps it's HOCH2COOCH2CH3. Oh wait, that would be methyl 2-hydroxyacetic acid. Wait no, 2-hydroxypropanoate would have three carbons: the hydroxyl on the second carbon.

Wait, perhaps I should draw this:

The molecule is CH3-C(OOCH3)-OH? No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, the structure is:

The ester would be CH3-OOC-CH(OH)-CH3? Hmm, that's 2-hydroxypropanoate. So the structure is:

O
|
O-C-OCH3
|
CH(OH)CH3

Wait, no, perhaps not. Alternatively, the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is (CH3)2C(OH)COOCH3. No, that's 3-hydroxy. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct structure is (HOCH2)CH2COOCH3. But that's 2-hydroxypropanoate: the hydroxyl is on the second carbon of a three-carbon chain.

So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So, the molecule would have the hydroxyl on the central carbon, connected to two CH2 groups and a COOCH3 group.

Wait, but then the molecule would have a chiral center at the hydroxyl-bearing carbon. Because if the central carbon has four different groups: two CH2 (no, wait, if it's CH2 groups on either side), wait.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the central carbon (carbon 2) is attached to:

- OH group,

- CH3 (from the other end?), no, wait:

Wait, wait, the structure is:

Carbon 1: CH3-

Carbon 2: CH(OH)-

Carbon 3: COOCH3

Wait, that's not correct because that would be propanoic acid. Hmm, perhaps it's better to imagine the molecule as:

O
||O
COOCH3 is attached to a CH2 group, which is attached to another CH2 group with an OH.

Wait, I'm getting stuck on the structure, but perhaps the key point is whether the molecule has a chiral center.

If the central carbon (carbon 2) is connected to:

- two CH2 groups (but wait, maybe not), or perhaps:

Wait, in methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the central carbon (carbon 2) is connected to:

- a hydroxyl group,

- two CH2 groups (one leading to CH3 and the other leading to COOCH3).

Wait, no, perhaps it's better to think of it as:

The molecule is CH3-CH2-COOCH3, but with a hydroxyl on the middle CH2. So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

So the central carbon (the one with the hydroxyl) is connected to:

- OH,

- CH3 (from the adjacent CH2 group),

- COOCH3,

- and another CH2 group (but wait, that can't be right, because then it's a CH2 group leading to where? Maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

O
||O
COOCH3 is attached to a CH2 group, which is attached to another CH2 group with an OH.

So the molecule is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. The central carbon (CH2 with OH) is connected to:

- OH,

- CH2COOCH3,

- two CH2 groups? No, because the chain is CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3. Wait, no, that would make the central carbon (the one with OH) connected to:

- OH,

- two CH2 groups (one on each side of the OH),

- and a COOCH3 group on one end.

Wait, no, because if it's CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3, then the structure is:

CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3.

So the central carbon (the one with the OH) is connected to:

- OH,

- two CH2 groups (but wait, that would mean two identical groups, which would make it not chiral.

Wait, the central carbon is the second carbon, so connected to:

- one OH,

- one CH2 group (which is connected to the third carbon, which is COOCH3),

- and two CH2 groups leading to the first and third carbons.

Wait, no, perhaps the central carbon is connected to:

- OH,

- CH2CH3 (no, because the chain is CH2CH2COOCH3. Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is HOCH2CH2COOCH3. In that case, each of the CH2 groups are connected to the same groups on either side. So the central carbon (the one with OH) has:

- OH,

- CH2CH3 (no, wait, that's not correct).

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So, the central carbon is the hydroxyl-bearing carbon. So the groups attached to it are:

- OH,

- CH2COOCH3,

- two CH3 groups? No, because the other side is CH2.

Wait, maybe it has:

- OH,

- two CH2 groups (one leading to the methyl ester and one leading to another CH2 group).

Wait, I'm so confused. Maybe it's better to think of this as whether the molecule has a chiral center. A chiral center requires four different substituents.

In methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, the hydroxyl is on the second carbon. The substituents on that carbon would be:

1. OH,

2. CH3 (from the adjacent CH2 group? No, wait, perhaps not. Let me try to imagine it.

The structure is:

Carbon 1: CH3-

Carbon 2: CH(OH)-

Carbon 3: COOCH3

Wait, that would make Carbon 2 attached to:

- OH,

- CH3 (from Carbon 1),

- COOCH3 (from Carbon 3),

- and another CH2 group (but wait, Carbon 2 is CH(OH), attached to Carbon 1 and Carbon 3. So the groups would be:

- OH,

- CH3 (from Carbon 1),

- COOCH3 (from Carbon 3),

- and a hydrogen? Because if Carbon 2 is CH(OH), then it's connected to Carbon 1 (CH2?), Carbon 3 (CH2?), and an OH and a hydrogen.

Wait, no, perhaps the structure is more like:

The ester is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So, Carbon 2 has:

- OH,

- two CH2 groups (one on each side),

- and the COOCH3 on one side.

Wait, no, that can't be right because each carbon can have four bonds.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3.

So, the central carbon (Carbon 2) is connected to:

- OH,

- two CH2 groups (one on each side: one to Carbon 1 and one to Carbon 3),

- and a COOCH3 group on Carbon 3.

Wait, no, that can't be. Wait, perhaps the structure is:

The molecule is CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3.

So, Carbon 2 is CH2, with substituents:

- OH,

- CH2- (leading to CH3),

- CH2- (leading to COOCH3),

- and a hydrogen?

No, because CH2 has two H's. Wait, I'm getting stuck, but perhaps the key takeaway is that the central carbon (Carbon 2) is connected to:

- OH,

- two CH2 groups (but that would mean two identical substituents, making it not chiral),

- and the other substituent is a CH2 connected to COOCH3.

Wait, no, because if Carbon 2 is CH2(OH), then it's connected to:

- OH,

- two CH2 groups leading to Carbon 1 (CH3) and Carbon 3 (COOCH3),

- and a hydrogen.

Wait, but that would mean the substituents are: OH, CH3 (from the other side?), COOCH3, and a hydrogen. No, because Carbon 2 is CH2, so it's connected to:

- OH,

- CH2CH3 (if it's Carbon 1),

Wait, I'm just not getting this right. Maybe it's better to think of whether the molecule has a chiral center. If the central carbon (Carbon 2) has four different groups attached, then it's chiral.

In this case, the groups would be:

1. OH,

2. CH2CH3 (if Carbon 1 is CH3-CH2-),

3. COOCH3,

4. H.

Wait, but in the structure I'm imagining, Carbon 2 would have:

- OH,

- two CH2 groups (one leading to CH3, the other to COOCH3),

- and a H.

Wait, but then that would mean two CH2 groups are attached, which are same substituents, so it can't be chiral.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong. Alternatively, maybe the molecule is (CH3)2C(OH)COOCH3, which would make the central carbon (the one attached to OH) have substituents: CH3, CH3, COOCH3, and OH. But then two substituents are CH3, so it wouldn't be chiral.

Hmm, but if the structure is CH3-C(OH)-CH2-COOCH3, then the central carbon (the one with OH) is attached to:

- OH,

- CH3,

- CH2COOCH3,

- and another CH2 group (but then the two CH2 groups would be same, making it not chiral).

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the correct structure is such that the central carbon has four different groups, making it chiral.

If that's the case, then methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would have a chiral center and thus exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, wait, I think I'm confusing the structure. Let me think of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. Its structure would be CH3CH(OH)COOH. So the ester would be CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. So the structure is:

CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3.

Wait, no, because that would be 2-hydroxypropanoic acid, right? So the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOH. When esterified, the -OH is replaced with OCH3. So the ester is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

In that case, the central carbon (the one with OH) is attached to:

- OH,

- CH3,

- COOCH3,

- and another CH group (but wait, no, that's not possible because each carbon has four bonds).

Wait, no, perhaps the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So the central carbon (CH(OH)) is attached to:

- OH,

- CH3,

- COOCH3,

- and another CH group (but that would be the same as CH3, so maybe not).

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me try to imagine the structure again. If the compound is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, it's the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid.

So the structure would be:

CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3.

Wait, but that would make the central carbon (the one with OH) have substituents:

- OH,

- CH3,

- COOCH3,

- and another CH3 (from the adjacent carbon). So that's two CH3 groups, so it's not a chiral center.

Wait, that can't be right because then the central carbon would have two identical substituents. So perhaps I'm wrong about the structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

HO-CH2-CH2-COOCH3.

In that case, the central carbon (CH2 with OH) is attached to:

- OH,

- two CH2 groups (one leading to another CH2 and one leading to COOCH3),

- and a hydrogen. But that would mean two CH2 groups, so same substituents, making it not chiral.

Hmm, this is confusing. Maybe I should just check the possibility: if the molecule has a chiral center, then it can show optical isomerism.

In option 2, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, the central carbon (the one with OH) has four different groups: OH, COOCH3, CH3, and another group. Wait, if the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3, the central carbon is attached to:

- OH,

- COOCH3,

- CH3,

- and another CH (but that would be the same as CH3, which would make it not a chiral center).

Wait, I'm getting stuck, but maybe the correct answer is that it does have a chiral center and thus exhibits optical isomerism.

Moving on to number 3: benzophenone. Benzophenone is (Ph)2CO, where Ph is the phenyl group. The structure is two phenyl groups attached to a ketone. The ketone group is in the middle, so the structure is Ph-C(O)-Ph.

Does benzophenone exhibit optical isomerism? Well, for a compound to have optical isomers, it must have a chiral center or some other form of asymmetry, like a planar chiral center or a meso compound. But benzophenone doesn't have any chiral centers. The central carbon is connected to two phenyl groups, an O, and a double bond (C=O). Wait, no, the central carbon is connected to two phenyl groups and an O in the carbonyl group. The structure is:

Ph–C(=O)–Ph.

So the central carbon has two phenyl groups, a carbonyl oxygen (double bond), and another single bond to the carbonyl group. Wait, no, the carbonyl group is O double-bonded to C. So the structure is Ar–C(O)–Ar, where Ar is aryl.

Wait, so the central carbon (the one in the ketone) is connected to two phenyl groups and a carbonyl group (which is O double-bonded). But wait, the carbon in the ketone is double-bonded to O, so it can't have four substituents. So the structure is:

Ph–C(=O)–Ph.

So the central carbon is bonded to two phenyl groups, a carbonyl group (double bond, so only one substituent), and what else? Oh, wait, no. Wait, the central carbon is part of the carbonyl group. So the structure is:

Ph–C(=O)–Ph.

So the carbon is bonded to two phenyl groups and the oxygen. But since it's a ketone, the central carbon is double-bonded to O, so it's only connected to two phenyl groups and the O (with a double bond). Thus, it can't be a chiral center because it's only connected to three different groups (two phenyl and one O), but wait, no, because it's a trigonal planar geometry, not tetrahedral. So no chiral center there.

Therefore, benzophenone doesn't have any chiral centers and is not chiral, so it doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Number 4: dimethyl fumarate. Fumaric acid is a diastereomer of maleic acid. The structure of fumaric acid is (Z)-butenedioic acid. Its ester, dimethyl fumarate, would be the diester of fumaric acid. So, the structure is:

CH2CH2(COOCH3)2, but in the trans configuration.

Wait, fumarate is the trans isomer of maleate. So the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides of the double bond.

So the structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2, but in the trans configuration.

Wait, no, more accurately, the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
     \
C=C
     /
O
||
O-C-OCH3

Wait, no, that's not correct. Fumarate is the trans isomer, so the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond.

So the structure is:

COOCH3
|
C=CH
|
COOCH3

Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think again. The correct structure for dimethyl fumarate is:

The molecule is (E)-butenedioic acid dimethyl ester, which is:

CH2=CH(COOCH3)2, but in the (E) configuration.

So the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond.

Now, does this molecule exhibit optical isomerism?

Well, for a molecule to have optical isomerism, it must have chirality, which can come from a chiral center or a planar chiral center or another form of asymmetry.

But in this case, the molecule has a double bond with substituents on either side. However, in the case of a double bond, if the substituents on each carbon are different, can that lead to optical isomerism?

Wait, in the case of fumarate, the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. So the molecule is (E)-configured. But does this make it chiral?

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a center of symmetry, making it achiral.

Wait, no. Let's think: if the molecule has two identical groups on each end of the double bond, then it might have a plane of symmetry. For example, if each end has the same substituents, perhaps the molecule is not chiral.

In dimethyl fumarate, each end of the double bond has a COOCH3 group. So the structure is:

COOCH3
|
CH2-CH2
|
COOCH3

Wait, no, that's not correct. The structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2, but in the trans configuration. So each end has a COOCH3 group and a CH2 group.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
     \
      C=C
     /
O
||
O-C-OCH3

Wait, that can't be right because that would imply a single bond between the carbons, but actually, it's a double bond.

Alternatively, the structure is:

CH2-CH2 with double bond between C1 and C2.

Wait, no. Let me think about fumarate. Fumarate is the trans isomer, so the structure is:

COOCH3
|
CH2–CH2–COOCH3

But that's not with a double bond. Wait, wait, fumarate is the trans isomer of maleic acid's diester. Maleic acid is (Z)-butenedioic acid, and fumaric acid is (E)-butenedioic acid.

So the structure of dimethyl fumarate would be:

CH2=C(COOCH3)CH2(COOCH3).

No, that's not correct. Wait, perhaps it's:

COOCH3
|
C=C
|
COOCH3

But that can't be right because that would imply each end is connected to a COOCH3 and a H, but in reality, each end would have a CH2 group.

Wait, maybe the correct structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2, in the trans configuration. So each CH2 is attached to a COOCH3 and a double bond.

Wait, I think the correct structure is:

CH2=CH(COOCH3)2, where the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides of the double bond (trans configuration).

So, the molecule is:

O
||O
O-C-OCH3
     \
C=C
     /
O
||O
O-C-OCH3

Wait, but that would imply that each end of the double bond has two COOCH3 groups, which isn't possible. Hmm, perhaps the correct structure is that each of the two central carbons (the ones in the double bond) has a CH2 group attached to a COOCH3.

Wait, no, perhaps the structure is:

COOCH3–CH2–CH2–COOCH3, but with a double bond between the two central CH2 groups. So, it's CH2–CH2 with a double bond and each CH2 has a COOCH3.

Wait, that can't be right because the double bond would have to be between the two CH2 groups, making them CH2=CH.

So, the structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2, but with the two COOCH3 groups on opposite sides (trans), hence (E) configuration.

Now, does this molecule have a plane of symmetry? Since the groups on each side of the double bond are identical (each CH2 is attached to two COOCH3 groups?), then perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral.

Wait, but in dimethyl fumarate, each end of the double bond has a CH2 group attached to a COOCH3. So the substituents on each carbon of the double bond are:

On each carbon, we have a CH2COOCH3 and a H (but wait, that's if the structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2).

Wait, no. Wait, the correct structure is:

The molecule is (E)-butenedioate dimethyl ester, which is:

CH2=CH–(COOCH3)2, but in the trans configuration. So each CH2 is attached to a COOCH3.

But wait, each of the double bond carbons is attached to two CH2 groups and a COOCH3 group?

No, perhaps each double bond carbon has a CH2 group and a COOCH3 group.

Wait, I'm getting stuck on the structure, but perhaps the key point is whether the molecule has chirality.

In the case of dimethyl fumarate, because the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides of the double bond, the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry. Therefore, it would be chiral, leading to optical isomerism.

Wait, no. Wait, if the substituents on each carbon of the double bond are identical on both ends, then the molecule might have a plane of symmetry.

But in dimethyl fumarate, each end of the double bond has a CH2COOCH3 group. So each end is the same. So the molecule is symmetrical, meaning it's not chiral. Therefore, it doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait, fumarate is the trans isomer, and if the substituents on each end are the same, then the molecule would have a plane of symmetry and thus be achiral.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents on each end are different. For example, each double bond carbon has a COOCH3 and a H, but that would make the substituents different, leading to chirality.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think: For a molecule to be chiral, it can't have a plane of symmetry. So, if the substituents on each end of the double bond are the same, the molecule is symmetrical and thus not chiral.

In dimethyl fumarate, each end has a COOCH3 and a CH2 group connected to another COOCH3. Wait, no. Let me think of it as:

The structure is:

CH2–COOCH3
   \
C=C
   /
CH2–COOCH3

But in the trans configuration, so the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides. Wait, but then each end would have a COOCH3 and a CH2 group, making the substituents on each end identical. So the molecule would have a plane of symmetry along the double bond, making it achiral. So dimethyl fumarate is not chiral and doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but I'm getting conflicting information. I thought fumarate is a diastereomer of maleate, and their esters can have stereoisomerism. But perhaps I'm confusing this with another compound.

Wait, perhaps the key point is that dimethyl fumarate is an example of a trans-diesters, which can have geometric isomerism but not optical isomerism because they don't have a chiral center.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm wrong, and dimethyl fumarate does have a chiral center.

Wait, another approach: which of these compounds have a chiral center?

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate: do the substituents make the molecule chiral?

I'm not sure, but perhaps the biphenyl structure leads to chirality if the substituents are arranged asymmetrically.

2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: if it has a chiral center, then yes.

3. Benzophenone: no chiral centers.

4. Dimethyl fumarate: no chiral centers, only geometric isomerism.

So, among the options, if 1 and 2 have optical isomerism, and 4 doesn't, then the correct answer would include 1 and 2.

Wait, but I'm not sure about number 1.

Alternatively, perhaps number 1 is not chiral because the substituents are arranged symmetrically.

Wait, the structure of number 1 is dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

So, each benzene ring has a COOCH3 at 2 and a NO2 at 6. So each ring has two substituents: 2 and 6 positions. Since the biphenyl is 1,1', the two rings are connected at positions 1 and 1'.

Each ring has a COOCH3 at 2 and a NO2 at 6.

Wait, but in a benzene ring, substituents at 2 and 6 are para to each other. So, each ring has a COOCH3 at position 2 and a NO2 at position 6, which are para positions. So the substituents on each ring are in a para arrangement.

Now, if the two rings are connected at 1 and 1', the substituents on each ring are in positions that are symmetric with respect to the central bond.

So, if you mirror the molecule across the central bond, the substituents would swap between the rings, but since each ring has the same substituents, the molecule would have a plane of symmetry. Hence, it's achiral and doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

So, number 1 doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

So, going back:

Which compounds exhibit optical isomerism?

2: If it has a chiral center, yes.

4: No.

3: No.

So, which options include 2 and/or others.

Looking at the options, option A is 1,2,4. But 1 and 4 don't have optical isomerism as per above. So, perhaps I'm wrong.

Option A: 1,2,4 – I think 1 and 4 don't have optical isomerism, so this option is incorrect.

Option B: 3 and 4 – No, as both don't have optical isomerism.

Option C: 2 and 3 – 3 doesn't, so incorrect.

Option D: 1 and 2 – 1 doesn't, so incorrect.

Wait, but earlier I thought that 2 might have a chiral center. So, the only compound that exhibits optical isomerism is number 2.

Wait, but looking at the options, is that an option? Let me check the options.

Options:

A) 1, 2, 4

B) 3, 4

C)2,3

D)1,2

Wait, so none of the options have only 2. So perhaps I'm wrong about compound 2.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in determining if methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center.

Revisiting compound 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

The structure is CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3.

Wait, no, that would imply the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

So the central carbon (the CH(OH)) is connected to:

- OH,

- CH3,

- COOCH3,

- and another CH group (but that would be another substituent, perhaps another CH2 or something else).

Wait, no, each carbon has four bonds. So, the structure is:

Carbon 1: CH3-

Carbon 2: CH(OH)-

Carbon 3: COOCH3.

So, the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

The central carbon (Carbon 2) is attached to:

- OH,

- CH3 (from Carbon 1),

- COOCH3 (from Carbon 3),

- and a hydrogen.

Wait, no, that can't be because Carbon 2 would then have four substituents: OH, CH3, COOCH3, and a single bond to Carbon 3.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-COOCH3.

No, that would be a longer chain.

Wait, perhaps it's better to note that 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would have the structure CH2(OH)CH2COOH. So the ester would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

In that case, the central carbon (in the CH2 group with OH) would be attached to:

- OH,

- two CH2 groups (one leading to CH3 and one leading to COOCH3),

- and a hydrogen.

Wait, but that makes the substituents on the central carbon: OH, CH2CH3 (if the chain is longer), but perhaps not.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is (CH3)2C(OH)COOCH3, which would make the central carbon (the one with OH) attached to:

- OH,

- two CH3 groups,

- COOCH3.

But that would have two identical substituents (CH3), so it's not chiral.

Hmm, I'm really stuck on this. Maybe I should look for another way to determine if the compound is chiral.

Another approach: can the compound have a plane of symmetry? If yes, then it's not chiral.

In methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it's not chiral.

Wait, if the hydroxyl is on the central carbon and the molecule is symmetrical around that carbon, then it's not chiral.

Alternatively, if the substituents are all different, then it is chiral.

So, in the structure CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3, the central carbon has:

- OH,

- CH3,

- COOCH3,

- and another CH group (maybe from the adjacent carbon, which is CH2, but perhaps that's not right).

Wait, perhaps the central carbon is attached to four different groups: OH, CH3, COOCH3, and another CH2 group (which is connected to another CH3). But if that's the case, then the substituents are:

1. OH,

2. CH3,

3. COOCH3,

4. CH2CH3.

Wait, no, because the chain is only three carbons.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are:

- OH,

- CH2COOCH3,

- two CH2 groups (but that would make two substituents same).

I'm getting stuck again. Maybe I should conclude that compound 2 does not have a chiral center, hence no optical isomerism.

If that's the case, then none of the compounds would exhibit optical isomerism except perhaps number 4.

But earlier, I thought number 4 (dimethyl fumarate) doesn't have a chiral center either.

Wait, but maybe I'm wrong about number 4. Let me think again.

Dimethyl fumarate's structure is (E)-but-2-enedioate dimethyl ester.

The structure is CH2=C(COOCH3)CH2(COOCH3).

Wait, no, that's not correct. The correct structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2, in the trans configuration.

So, each of the double bond carbons is connected to a COOCH3 and a CH3 group?

No, wait, that can't be right.

Alternatively, it's CH2=CH–COOCH3 and another COOCH3 on the same carbon. No.

I think I'm stuck on the structure, but perhaps the key point is that dimethyl fumarate is a trans diester and doesn't have a chiral center, so it doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

So, from all this, the only compound that exhibits optical isomerism is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (number 2), assuming it has a chiral center.

Looking back at the options, option A includes 1,2,4. But I think 1 and 4 don't have optical isomerism. Option D includes 1 and 2, but I think 1 doesn't. So perhaps the correct answer is that only number 2 exhibits optical isomerism, but none of the options include only 2.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me think again: if methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate doesn't have a chiral center, then none of the compounds do. But that can't be, because option A says 1,2,4. But that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm wrong about number 1. Let me think again about compound 1.

Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

Each benzene ring has substituents at positions 2 and 6. The substituent at 2 is COOCH3, and at 6 is NO2. So each ring has COOCH3 at position 2 and NO2 at position 6. Now, if the two rings are connected at positions 1 and 1', what's the symmetry?

If the substituents at positions 2 and 6 on each ring are identical, and their positions are mirrored across the central bond, the molecule might be symmetrical, making it achiral. Alternatively, if the arrangement is such that no plane of symmetry exists, the molecule would be chiral.

Wait, but in this case, each ring has the same substituents. So the molecule would have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. Hence, no optical isomerism.

So, the only compound left is number 2. But looking at the options, there's no option that includes only 2. So perhaps I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, looking at the options again:

Option A: 1,2,4 → but I think 1 and 4 don't exhibit optical isomerism.

Option B: 3,4 → both don't.

Option C: 2,3 → 3 doesn't, so incorrect.

Option D:1,2 → both incorrect.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think about compound 4 again.

Wait, dimethyl fumarate is a trans diastereomer. Does it have a chiral center? No. So no optical isomerism.

Wait, what about if the substituents on the double bond are different? For example, if one end has a COOCH3 and the other has a different group, then the molecule could be chiral.

But in dimethyl fumarate, both ends have COOCH3, so it's symmetric. Hence, not chiral.

So, the only compound that could exhibit optical isomerism is number 2, but since none of the options include only 2, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating it.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm wrong about compound 2. Let me think again: the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. The central carbon (CH(OH)) is attached to:

- OH,

- CH3,

- COOCH3,

- and another CH group (but that's not possible, as each carbon has four bonds).

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the central carbon is CH2(OH), attached to:

- OH,

- two CH2 groups (leading to CH3 and COOCH3),

- and a hydrogen.

In this case, the substituents on the central carbon are: OH, CH2CH3, CH2COOCH3, and H. Wait, but then the substituents would be:

- OH,

- CH2CH3,

- CH2COOCH3,

- H.

Wait, but that would imply four different substituents, making the carbon a chiral center. Hence, the molecule would exhibit optical isomerism.

So, if the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3, then the central carbon (CH2(OH)) is connected to:

- OH,

- CH2CH3 (from one side),

- CH2COOCH3 (from the other side),

- and a hydrogen.

Wait, but that would make the substituents: OH, CH2CH3, CH2COOCH3, H. So four different groups, meaning it's a chiral center. Hence, the molecule would exhibit optical isomerism.

So, that would mean compound 2 (methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate) does exhibit optical isomerism.

But earlier, I thought that compound 1 didn't. So, according to this, the correct answer would include compound 2.

Looking back at the options, option A includes 1,2,4. But if 1 and 4 don't exhibit optical isomerism, and only 2 does, then perhaps none of the options are correct. But that can't be the case.

Wait, another thing: what about the possibility that compound 4 (dimethyl fumarate) does have a chiral center? No, because it's a di-ester with identical substituents on each end of the double bond, making it achiral.

Hmm.

Wait, another approach: which of the options are correct.

Looking at the options, the correct answer should be 2 and 4, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm wrong about compound 4. Suppose dimethyl fumarate is a trans diester and has a chiral center. Wait, no, because the substituents on each end are same, so it's symmetric.

Wait, another thought: perhaps dimethyl fumarate has a plane of symmetry through the central double bond, making it achiral.

So, the only compound that has optical isomerism is number 2 (methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate).

But looking at the options, option A includes 1,2,4. Option D includes 1 and 2. So, if only 2 is correct, but the options don't have a choice with just 2, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating compound 1.

Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

Each ring has substituents at 2 (COOCH3) and 6 (NO2). The biphenyl is connected at 1 and 1'.

If the substituents are arranged in such a way that the molecule has no plane of symmetry, it would be chiral.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, making it chiral.

Wait, if the substituents on each ring are in positions that are not mirror images, then the molecule might be chiral.

For example, if the substituents on one ring are in the 2 and 6 positions, and the other ring has substituents in 2' and 6' positions, but the arrangement across the central bond doesn't allow for a plane of symmetry.

Wait, perhaps the molecule has a chiral center, but I'm not seeing it. Alternatively, maybe the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral.

Hmm, perhaps I should conclude that only compound 2 exhibits optical isomerism.

But according to the options, none of the options include only 2. That can't be right, so perhaps I'm wrong.

Another Approach: Let me list each compound's possibility.

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

Analysis: Each ring has substituents at 2 and 6. If the substituents are arranged in a way that the molecule has no plane of symmetry, it can be chiral. For example, if the substituents on the two rings are in positions that make the molecule asymmetrical.

But in this case, the substituents are at 2 and 6 on each ring, which are para positions. So each ring's substituents are symmetrical with respect to the central bond. Hence, the molecule has a plane of symmetry and is not chiral.

Conclusion: No optical isomerism.

2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Analysis: If the central carbon has four different substituents, it's chiral. Structure CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3: the central carbon (CH2(OH)) is attached to OH, CH2CH3, CH2COOCH3, and H. So four different groups → chiral → exhibits optical isomerism.

Conclusion: Yes.

3. Benzophenone.

Analysis: No chiral centers; structure is symmetrical. No optical isomerism.

Conclusion: No.

4. Dimethyl fumarate.

Analysis: Structure is symmetrical (trans configuration with same substituents on both ends of the double bond). No chiral center. No optical isomerism.

Conclusion: No.

So, the only compound that exhibits optical isomerism is number 2. But looking at the options, none of the options include only 2. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating compound 4. Let me think again. Dimethyl fumarate: structure is (E)-but-2-enedioate dimethyl ester.

The structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2, trans configuration.

Wait, but each double bond carbon has a CH2 group and a COOCH3 group. So each carbon has:

- CH2 group,

- COOCH3 group,

- and two H's.

Wait, no. The structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2.

Wait, more accurately, each double bond carbon is attached to a COOCH3 and a CH2 group. Wait, that can’t be right because each double bond carbon has two substituents: one COOCH3 and one CH2 group.

Wait, that would make each double bond carbon attached to two different groups, but each carbon has two substituents (COOCH3 and CH2), plus the double bond. So, in terms of substituents, each carbon has:

- COOCH3,

- CH2 group,

- and two H's.

Wait, no, because the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the structure is:

CH2=CH-COOCH3 and another COOCH3 on the same carbon? No, that's not possible.

Alternatively, the correct structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
     \
C=C
     /
O
||
O-C-OCH3

But that would imply that each C in the double bond is attached to two OCH3 groups, which isn't possible because each C can only have four bonds.

I think I'm stuck on this. However, considering the time I've spent, perhaps the correct answer is option A: 1,2,4. But I'm not confident.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating compound 1.

Wait, another possibility: compound 1 has a chiral center due to the arrangement of the substituents on the biphenyl rings.

If the substituents are arranged in such a way that there's no plane of symmetry, the molecule could be chiral.

But given that each ring has substituents in para positions, the molecule would have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral.

So, I'll conclude that only compound 2 exhibits optical isomerism. However, since the options don't include an option with only 2, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering compound 4. Let me think again: does dimethyl fumarate have a plane of symmetry?

The structure is:

CH2=CH(COOCH3)2, trans configuration.

Wait, each end of the double bond has a CH2 group and a COOCH3 group. So, the substituents on each end are CH2 and COOCH3, making the molecule symmetric across the double bond. Therefore, it's not chiral.

So, the only compound that exhibits optical isomerism is number 2.

But looking back at the options, option A includes 1,2,4. Since I think 1 and 4 don't exhibit optical isomerism, perhaps the correct answer is that only 2 does, but the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in thinking that compound 2 has a chiral center. Let me think again: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

The central carbon (CH2(OH)) is connected to:

- OH,

- CH2CH3 (from the other end),

- COOCH3,

- and H.

Wait, no, the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the central carbon (CH2(OH)) is connected to:

- OH,

- CH2 group (leading to CH2COOCH3),

- and two H's.

Wait, that can't be. Each CH2 has two H's. So, the substituents would be:

- OH,

- CH2COOCH3,

- and two H's.

So, the substituents are:

1. OH,

2. CH2COOCH3,

3. H,

4. H.

So, two H's are identical, meaning the central carbon isn't a chiral center. Therefore, the molecule doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

That changes everything. So, none of the compounds exhibit optical isomerism.

But that can't be right either, because one of the options must be correct.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong about compound 2. Let me think again: the structure of methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

The central carbon (CH(OH)) is attached to:

- OH,

- CH3,

- COOCH3,

- and another CH2 group (leading to where?).

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH3-C(OH)-CH2-COOCH3. Therefore, the central carbon (C(OH)) is attached to:

- OH,

- CH3,

- CH2COOCH3,

- and another CH group (but that can't be right).

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong, but this is taking too long. I think I need to make a decision based on what I've deduced.

So, the correct answer is that only compound 2 exhibits optical isomerism, but since the options don't include that, perhaps the correct answer is option A, which includes 1,2,4. But I'm not confident.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me look for a different approach.

Another Approach: Which of these compounds have a chiral center?

1. Biphenyl with substituents: if the substituents are arranged asymmetrically, then yes.

But in this case, the substituents are symmetrical, so no.

2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: if the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3, then the central carbon has four different substituents: OH, CH3, COOCH3, and another CH group. Wait, but that would require four different groups, making it chiral.

But earlier, I thought the substituents were not all different. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct structure is such that the central carbon has four different substituents, making it chiral.

If that's the case, then compound 2 exhibits optical isomerism.

So, if only 2 is correct, but the options don't have an option for that, perhaps the correct answer is option A, which includes 1,2,4, but I'm not confident.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look for another approach, like considering the possibility of planar chirality.

But I'm out of time. I'll make a decision based on what I think is correct.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine which organic compounds exhibit optical isomerism, we analyze each compound for chirality, which requires the presence of a chiral center or another form of asymmetry such as planar chirality. Optical isomerism arises when a compound has non-superimposable mirror images, typically due to chirality.

### Analysis of Each Compound:

1. **Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**  
   This compound consists of two benzene rings connected at positions 1 and 1', with substituents at positions 2 (COOCH₃) and 6 (NO₂) on each ring. The substituents on each ring are in para positions, and the molecule has a plane of symmetry across the central bond. This symmetry makes the molecule achiral, and thus it does not exhibit optical isomerism.

2. **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**  
   The structure of this compound is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The central carbon (CH(OH)) is attached to four different groups: OH, CH₃, COOCH₃, and another CH group. This makes the central carbon a chiral center, and the molecule exhibits optical isomerism.

3. **Benzophenone**  
   Benzophenone has the structure (Ph)₂C=O, where Ph is a phenyl group. The central carbon is double-bonded to oxygen and bonded to two phenyl groups, leaving no room for chirality. Additionally, the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral and incapable of optical isomerism.

4. **Dimethyl Fumarate**  
   Dimethyl fumarate is the trans (E) isomer of butenedioate dimethyl ester, with the structure CH₂=C(COOCH₃)₂. The molecule has identical substituents (COOCH₃ groups) on both ends of the double bond, which creates a plane of symmetry. As a result, it is achiral and does not exhibit optical isomerism.

### Conclusion:
Among the given compounds, only **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (compound 2)** exhibits optical isomerism due to the presence of a chiral center. None of the other compounds have the necessary structural features for chirality.

ANSWER: D
