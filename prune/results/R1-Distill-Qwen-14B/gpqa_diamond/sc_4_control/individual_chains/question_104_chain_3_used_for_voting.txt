Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I remember that the radial velocity method detects planets by the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravitational pull. The star moves back and forth, and that causes the spectral lines to shift.

The question says there are two stars, both with the same mass as the Sun. Each has a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. So both planets are about the same mass, but the stars are identical too. They're in circular orbits, so that simplifies things.

The data given is about the spectral line shifts. Planet #1 causes a shift of up to 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2 causes a 7 milliangstrom shift. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1.

Wait, I think the radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) is related to the Doppler shift. K is the maximum velocity of the star in the direction of the observer, right? And this K would relate to the Doppler shift. But wait, the shift here is given in terms of wavelength, not velocity. Oh, right, because the Doppler shift can be expressed in terms of wavelength change as well. So the formula for the Doppler shift in terms of wavelength is delta_lambda / lambda = v/c, where v is the velocity.

But wait, in the radial velocity method, the semi-amplitude K is the velocity amplitude, so K is what's measured. But here, the data is given as the wavelength shift. So I need to relate the two.

Wait, the problem gives the wavelength shifts as 5 and 7 milliangstroms. So I can calculate the velocity shifts from that. Because delta_lambda (in angstroms) equals (v/c) * lambda.

Wait, the formula for the Doppler shift in terms of wavelength is delta_lambda = (v / c) * lambda. But if the wavelength is in the same units as delta_lambda, then I can solve for v.

Wait, but the actual relation is that the velocity v is (delta_lambda / lambda) * c. Since c is the speed of light, approximately 3e5 km/s or 3e8 m/s depending on units.

So if the spectral line has a shift of delta_lambda, then the velocity K is v = c * (delta_lambda / lambda). But wait, delta_lambda is given in milliangstroms, which is 1e-3 angstrom. 1 angstrom is 1e-10 meters. So delta_lambda is 5e-13 meters, for example.

But wait, the actual value of lambda (the rest wavelength) matters. But wait, I think that when comparing the two Doppler shifts, the same spectral line is being used for both stars. So the rest wavelength (lambda) would be the same for both. Therefore, the ratio of K1 to K2 would be (delta_lambda1 / delta_lambda2) because lambda and c are the same for both.

Wait, so K is proportional to delta_lambda. So if Planet #1 has a shift of 5 and Planet #2 has 7, then K1 = 5, K2=7. Because if the rest wavelength is the same, then the velocity is proportional to the delta_lambda.

So K1/K2 = 5/7. So K1 is 5/7 of K2.

Wait, but K is the semi-amplitude of the star's velocity. The formula for K is given by:

K = ( (2 pi G) / (c) )^(1/3) * ( (M_p sin i) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) * (1 / ( (1 - e²)^(1/2) )) ) * (1 / (P^(1/3)) )

But wait, since the stars are identical (same mass) and the planets have the same mass, and assuming circular orbits (e=0), then the only variables are P and sin i. But if we assume that the inclination angles i are the same (or that sin i is the same for both), then K would be inversely proportional to P^(1/3).

Wait, because K is proportional to (M_p / M_star^(2/3) ) * (1 / P^(1/3)).

Wait, M_p is the planet mass, M_star is the star mass. Since both planets have same M_p and same M_star, K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3).

So K1 = (1/P1^(1/3)) * const.

Similarly, K2 = (1/P2^(1/3)) * const.

So K1/K2 = (P2^(1/3)) / (P1^(1/3)) )

Wait, but earlier I thought K1/K2 is 5/7. So from the velocity shifts, K1=5 and K2=7. So 5/7 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

Wait, wait, no. Let me think again. If K1 is 5 and K2 is7, then K1/K2 = 5/7. And from the formula, K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3) * (M2/M1), etc. But M_p is same, M_star same, so the only ratio is due to P.

Wait, no, wait. Let's clarify. The formula for K is proportional to (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) * ( (2 pi / P )^(1/3) ) )

Wait, maybe I should write the formula properly. The radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ (G * (M_p) * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) ) ) ]^(1/1) * (1/( (2 pi G)^(1/3) )) ) * (1/(P^(1/3))) )

Wait, perhaps I should look up the formula. Alternatively, I think the correct formula is:

K = ( (27 * pi * G) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) * (1 / (P^(1/3) * c) )

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should think about the relation between K and the period.

I remember that K is inversely proportional to the cube root of the period. Because K scales as (M_p / M_star^2) * (1 / (P^1/3)) )? Wait, perhaps another approach.

Another approach: Since both stars are identical and the planets have the same mass, the ratio of K1 to K2 is inversely proportional to the cube root of the ratio of their periods.

Wait, K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3) )

Wait, no, because if K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), then K1 = (constant) / P1^(1/3)

Similarly, K2 = (same constant) / P2^(1/3)

So K1/K2 = P2^(1/3) / P1^(1/3)

So rearranged: (K1/K2) = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

So (K1/K2)^3 = (P2/P1)

So P2/P1 = (K1/K2)^3

But K1 is 5, K2 is7. So K1/K2=5/7.

So (5/7)^3 = 125/343 ≈ 0.364.

So P2/P1 = (5/7)^3 ≈ 0.364.

So the orbital period of planet #2 is about 0.364 times that of planet #1. So the period of planet #2 is shorter than planet #1.

Wait, but the question is asking how many times longer is the orbital period of planet #2 than that of planet #1. So P2 is longer than P1? Or shorter? Because if K is smaller, does that mean P is longer?

Wait, because K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So if K is smaller, then P must be longer.

Wait, for example, if K1 is smaller than K2, then P1 is larger than P2. Because K = const / P^(1/3). So higher K implies shorter period.

So in this case, K1 is 5, K2 is7. So K2 > K1. So P2 < P1. So P2 is shorter than P1.

But the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1? So P2/P1 is less than 1, meaning it's shorter. So perhaps the question is phrased to find (P2/P1) times. Which would be less than 1.

Wait, but why is the question asking for how many times longer? Because if P2 is shorter, then it's not longer. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, wait. Let me go back. The formula is K = (v), and v is inversely proportional to the period. Because for a given star mass and planet mass, a longer period implies the star moves more slowly, so K is smaller.

So if K2 is larger than K1, that would mean P2 is smaller than P1.

So P2/P1 = (K1/K2)^3. So (5/7)^3 = ~0.36. So the period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times that of planet #1. So it's shorter. So the question is phrased as 'how many times longer is P2 than P1?' which would be 0.36 times. So the answer is approximately 0.36, which is option A.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is ~0.36, which would be the ratio P2/P1. So the period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times that of planet #1. So it's shorter. So the question is, how many times longer is planet #2's period than planet #1's. So the answer is 0.36, which is option A.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation. 5/7 is approximately 0.714. Cube that: 0.714^3. Let me compute that:

0.7^3 = 0.343.

0.714^3 is a bit more. 0.714 * 0.714 = approx 0.51 (since 0.7^2 is 0.49, 0.71^2 is ~0.5041), then multiply by 0.714 again: 0.5041 * 0.714 ≈ 0.5041 * 0.7 is 0.35287, plus 0.5041*0.014= ~0.00705, so total ≈ 0.3599. So around 0.36.

So the ratio P2/P1 is approximately 0.36, so P2 is about 0.36 times the period of P1. So it's 0.36 times as long. So how many times longer? It's shorter, so the factor is less than 1. So the answer is option A.

The radial velocity (RV) method detects planets by measuring the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum caused by the gravitational pull of the planet. The semi-amplitude \( K \) of the star's velocity is proportional to the Doppler shift, which is given in milliangstroms for this problem. For Planet #1, the shift is 5 milliangstroms, and for Planet #2, it is 7 milliangstroms. Since the stars and planets are identical in mass and the orbits are circular, the relationship between \( K \) and the orbital period \( P \) is given by:

\[
K \propto \frac{1}{P^{1/3}}
\]

This implies:

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right)^{1/3}
\]

Rearranging, the ratio of the orbital periods is:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{K_1}{K_2}\right)^3
\]

Substituting \( K_1 = 5 \) and \( K_2 = 7 \):

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3
\]

Calculating:

\[
\left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3 = \frac{125}{343} \approx 0.364
\]

Thus, the orbital period of Planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of Planet #1. Since the question asks how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1, the answer is approximately 0.36.
