Okay, so I have this chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Alright, the question is about cobalt(II) ions in a solution with thiocyanate. The problem gives me the stability constants for different complexes and asks about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex among all cobalt species.

Hmm, first, I need to understand the problem. The solution has Co²+ and SCN⁻. The total cobalt concentration is 0.01 M, and the SCN⁻ is 0.1 M. The stability constants β1 to β4 are given. I think these represent the formation constants for different complexes, probably [Co(SCN)_n]²− where n is 1 to 4.

Wait, the question is specifically about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex. I've heard that [Co(SCN)₂]²− is blue. So I'm assuming we need to find the fraction of Co²+ that is in the form of [Co(SCN)₂]²−.

Stability constants, β, are the formation constants. Each β represents the equilibrium between the metal ion (Co²+) and the complex with that many ligands. So for a complex with n ligands, the formation reaction is Co²+ + n SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)_n]²−, and βn is the equilibrium constant for that reaction.

The problem is asking for the fraction of the blue complex, which is [Co(SCN)₂]²−. So I need to find the concentration of this complex relative to all possible cobalt species.

But wait, stability constants can sometimes depend on the order of ligand addition. However, in this case, since the solution is prepared with Co²+ and SCN⁻, I think all possible complexes will form, and the distribution will depend on the stability constants.

So, the approach is to calculate the fraction of each possible complex (n=0 to 4) and then sum them up. The fraction for n=2 will give the percentage of the blue complex.

But how do I calculate the fraction for each complex? I remember that the fraction fn for each complex [Co(SCN)_n]²− can be calculated using the formula:

fn = (βn * [SCN⁻]^n) / (1 + sum_{k=0}^4 βk [SCN⁻]^k )

Wait, but wait. Wait, the formula is a bit different because the denominator is the sum of all possible complexes plus the free Co²+ ion. Wait, no, I think the fraction is given by the concentration of each complex divided by the total cobalt concentration. Because the total cobalt concentration is fixed at c(Co) = 1e-2 M.

So the fraction for each complex is [Co(SCN)_n]^2- / c(Co).

But to compute that, each fn can be expressed as (βn [SCN]^n) / (sum_{k=0}^4 βk [SCN]^k ) ), because the total is sum of βk [SCN]^k. Because the formation of each complex is independent, and the overall equation is the sum of all possible complexes plus the free ions, but the sum in the denominator is essentially the sum of all possible complexes.

Wait, perhaps more accurately, the fraction for each complex is ( βn [SCN]ⁿ ) / ( sum_{k=0}^4 βk [SCN]^k ) ), because the denominator is the total concentration of all complexes and the free Co²+.

Wait, no. The free Co²+ is actually equal to the concentration when n=0, which is [Co²+] = [SCN]⁰ = 1. So the denominator is sum_{n=0}^4 βn [SCN]^n, because f_n = (βn [SCN]^n) / (sum_{n=0}^4 βn [SCN]^n ) )

Wait, wait, I think that's correct. Because the overall reaction is the sum of all possible complexes. So, each complex's concentration is proportional to βn [SCN]^n. So the fraction is each term divided by the sum of all terms, including β0 [SCN]^0.

But what is β0? Because β0 is the formation constant for the complex with zero ligands, which is just the Co²+ itself. But typically, β0 is taken as 1 because it's the free ion. So in this case, the denominator would be sum from n=0 to 4 of βn [SCN]^n.

Wait, but the β values given are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So for n=0, β0 is 1, since the free ion is the starting point.

So, let me write down the denominator D as:

D = β0 [SCN]^0 + β1 [SCN]^1 + β2 [SCN]^2 + β3 [SCN]^3 + β4 [SCN]^4

Which is:

D = 1*(1) + 9*(0.1) + 40*(0.1)^2 + 63*(0.1)^3 + 16*(0.1)^4

Wait, because [SCN] is 0.1 M.

Let me compute each term:

For n=0: 1*1 = 1
n=1: 9*0.1 = 0.9
n=2:40*(0.01)=0.4
n=3:63*(0.001)=0.063
n=4:16*(0.0001)=0.0016

Adding them all up: 1 + 0.9 = 1.9; 1.9 + 0.4=2.3; 2.3 +0.063=2.363; 2.363 +0.0016=2.3646

So D is approximately 2.3646.

Wait, but wait, wait. Each term is βn multiplied by [SCN]^n. The denominator is the sum, and each term represents the contribution of each complex to the total.

So the fraction for each complex is (βn [SCN]^n) / D.

So the fraction for n=2 is (40 * (0.1)^2) / D.

Which is (40 * 0.01) = 0.4, divided by 2.3646.

So 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ ?

Let me calculate that. 0.4 / 2.3646.

Hmm, 2.3646 is about 2.3646.

0.4 divided by 2.3646.

Let me compute this as 400 / 2364.6 ≈ let me see:

2364.6 ÷ 400 = about 5.9115. So 400 ÷ 2364.6 ≈ 0.169.

Wait, but wait: 0.4 / 2.3646 = approximately 0.169 or 16.9%? Wait, 0.4 divided by 2.3646 is about 0.169, so 16.9%.

Wait, but that's for n=2. So the percentage is about 16.9%. Looking at the options, option D is 16.9%.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check the calculation.

Compute each term again:

n=0: 1 * 1 = 1
n=1:9 * 0.1=0.9
n=2:40 *0.01=0.4
n=3:63 *0.001=0.063
n=4:16 *0.0001=0.0016

Sum: 1 + 0.9 = 1.9; +0.4=2.3; +0.063=2.363; +0.0016=2.3646.

So D=2.3646.

So for n=2, (40*(0.1)^2)/D = 0.4 / 2.3646.

What's 0.4 divided by 2.3646? Let me compute this accurately.

2.3646 * 0.169 ≈ 2.3646 *0.169. Let me compute that:

0.1 *2.3646=0.23646
0.06 *2.3646=0.141876
0.009 *2.3646≈0.0212814
Adding these: 0.23646 + 0.141876=0.378336 +0.0212814=0.3996174. So 0.169 *2.3646≈0.3996.

Which is approximately 0.4. So 0.4/2.3646 ≈0.169.

So the fraction is approximately 16.9%, which would be option D.

Wait, but wait. The question asks for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes. But wait, dithiocyanato implies two SCN ligands. So that's the [Co(SCN)₂]²− complex, which is n=2. So the fraction for n=2 is 16.9%, which is option D.

Looking at the options, option D is 16.9%, which would be the answer.

To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)₂]²⁻, among all cobalt-containing species in the solution, we use the stability constants (β₁ = 9, β₂ = 40, β₃ = 63, β₄ = 16) and the given concentrations: total cobalt concentration c(Co) = 10⁻² M and [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M.

The fraction of each cobalt complex is calculated using the formula:

\[
f_n = \frac{\beta_n [\text{SCN}^-]^n}{\sum_{n=0}^4 \beta_n [\text{SCN}^-]^n}
\]

Here, β₀ = 1 (for the free Co²⁺ ion), and the denominator is the sum of all terms:

\[
D = \beta_0 [\text{SCN}^-]^0 + \beta_1 [\text{SCN}^-]^1 + \beta_2 [\text{SCN}^-]^2 + \beta_3 [\text{SCN}^-]^3 + \beta_4 [\text{SCN}^-]^4
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
D = 1 \cdot 1 + 9 \cdot 0.1 + 40 \cdot 0.1^2 + 63 \cdot 0.1^3 + 16 \cdot 0.1^4
\]

Calculating each term:

- \(1 \cdot 1 = 1\)
- \(9 \cdot 0.1 = 0.9\)
- \(40 \cdot 0.1^2 = 40 \cdot 0.01 = 0.4\)
- \(63 \cdot 0.1^3 = 63 \cdot 0.001 = 0.063\)
- \(16 \cdot 0.1^4 = 16 \cdot 0.0001 = 0.0016\)

Summing these:

\[
D = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646
\]

The fraction of the [Co(SCN)₂]²⁻ complex (n = 2) is:

\[
f_2 = \frac{\beta_2 [\text{SCN}^-]^2}{D} = \frac{40 \cdot 0.1^2}{2.3646} = \frac{0.4}{2.3646} \approx 0.169
\]

Thus, the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex is:

\[
f_2 \times 100 = 0.169 \times 100 = 16.9\%
\]

From the options, the correct answer is:

**D) 16.9%**
