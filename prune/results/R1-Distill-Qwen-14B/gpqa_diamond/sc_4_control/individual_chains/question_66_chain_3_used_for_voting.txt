Okay, so I have this question about the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) and the symmetries that operators must respect. Hmm, I remember that SMEFT is an effective theory that includes all possible higher-dimensional operators respecting certain symmetries. But wait, which symmetries exactly?

Let me think. Effective theories usually respect the same symmetries as the underlying theory they're derived from. The Standard Model respects Lorentz symmetry, right? Because all the particles and interactions are Lorentz-invariant. So any operator in SMEFT must also be Lorentz-invariant. That would mean Lorentz symmetry is a must. So option 1 is correct.

Poincaré symmetry is another one. Wait, Poincaré includes Lorentz and translations. So if an operator is Lorentz-invariant, it must also respect Poincaré symmetry? Because Poincaré symmetry includes the possibility of translations. Hmm, but wait, in SMEFT, the operators are written in a way that includes all possible terms that are consistent with the symmetries of the Standard Model. So if the theory as a whole is Poincaré-invariant, then the operators must respect that. So option 2, Poincare symmetry, must also be respected. So both 1 and 2 are correct.

What about the other options? CP symmetry. I think the Standard Model doesn't necessarily respect CP. For example, CP violation is observed in the neutral kaon system. So if the Standard Model can have CP violation, SMEFT operators might include terms that violate CP. Wait, but wait, no. SMEFT is just a low-energy effective theory; the operators are constructed to respect the symmetries of the Standard Model. Or wait, is that the case? Or is it that the operators are allowed to violate some symmetries as long as the underlying model does?

Wait, no. The SMEFT includes all possible operators that are in agreement with the symmetries of the Standard Model. So if the Standard Model doesn't have a symmetry, SMEFT won't impose it on the operators. For example, the SM can have operators that violate CP, so SMEFT would allow such operators as well, under the effective theory. So the operators in SMEFT don't necessarily have to respect CP symmetry, unless the SM requires it. So for the question, which says, "must be respected by all operators," that would mean that the operators are required to respect those symmetries. So if the SM doesn't require a symmetry, the operators don't have to.

So for option 3, CP symmetry: the operators in SMEFT are not required to respect CP. Because the SM itself doesn't have CP as a symmetry in all cases. So answer 3 is not a must.

What about CPT symmetry? I remember that all Lorentz-invariant theories must respect CPT symmetry. Because CPT is a combination of charge conjugation, parity, and time reversal. And in any Lorentz-invariant quantum field theory, CPT symmetry must hold. So if the operators must respect Lorentz symmetry (option 1), then they must also respect CPT symmetry (option 4). So option 4 is correct.

So putting it all together, which symmetries must all operators respect?

1. Lorentz Symmetry - yes.
2. Poincare symmetry - yes, because it's a superset of Lorentz and includes translations, which the SM respects.
3. CP symmetry - no, because SM doesn't require it.
4. CPT symmetry - yes, because Lorentz implies CPT.

Wait, but wait. Poincaré symmetry includes Lorentz and translations. So if an operator is in a Poincaré-invariant theory, it must be Lorentz-invariant as well. So if the theory is Poincaré-invariant, then all operators are Poincaré-invariant, which implies Lorentz-invariant.

But the question is about which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So if the theory as a whole is Poincaré-invariant, then the operators must respect that. So both 1 and 2 are required.

So the correct options are 1,2,4. Because 4 is required as a consequence of 1, perhaps. Because if the theory is Lorentz-invariant, it must also be CPT-invariant.

So looking at the options:

Option C) 1,2,4.

So the correct answer is C.

To determine which symmetries must be respected by all operators in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT), we analyze each option:

1. **Lorentz Symmetry**: SMEFT is derived from the Standard Model, which respects Lorentz symmetry. Therefore, all operators in SMEFT must also respect Lorentz symmetry.

2. **Poincaré Symmetry**: Poincaré symmetry includes both Lorentz symmetry and translation symmetry. Since SMEFT respects Lorentz symmetry and the Standard Model respects translation symmetry, SMEFT operators must also respect Poincaré symmetry.

3. **CP Symmetry**: The Standard Model does not necessarily respect CP symmetry (e.g., CP violation is observed in certain systems). Since SMEFT includes all possible operators consistent with the Standard Model, operators in SMEFT are not required to respect CP symmetry.

4. **CPT Symmetry**: Any Lorentz-invariant theory must respect CPT symmetry. Since SMEFT respects Lorentz symmetry, it must also respect CPT symmetry.

From this analysis, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are **Lorentz Symmetry (1)**, **Poincaré Symmetry (2)**, and **CPT Symmetry (4)**. CP symmetry (3) is not necessarily required, as the Standard Model does not enforce it.

**Correct Answer**: C) 1, 2, 4.
