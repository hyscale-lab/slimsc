Alright, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here. Hmm, let's see what it's about. Okay, the question is about two quantum states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are given as 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds respectively. The goal is to find their energy difference so that they can be clearly resolved. The options are A to D.

Wait, I remember something about the uncertainty principle here. Oh right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. It states that you can't simultaneously know both the energy and the lifetime of a particle with infinite precision. The product of the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) and the uncertainty in time (Δt) is at least ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. So, ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ.

The formula I think is ΔE ≈ ħ / Δt. Because the lifetime here is the uncertainty in time. So for each state, we can calculate the uncertainty in energy based on their lifetimes.

Wait, but the question is about the energy difference between E2 and E1. Oh, right. So the energy difference ΔE must be larger than the uncertainty in energy for each state for them to be distinguishable.

Wait, no. Wait, the question says we want to clearly distinguish the two energy levels. So the energy difference between E2 and E1 should be larger than the uncertainty in energy of each. Otherwise, if the energy difference is smaller than the uncertainty, they might appear as a single peak, making them indistinguishable.

Wait, or is it that the energy difference should be larger than the combined uncertainty? Hmm, not sure. Maybe each of their energy uncertainties should be smaller than the energy difference.

So let's break it down. Each state has its own lifetime and thus its own uncertainty in energy. The first state has a lifetime Δt1 = 1e-9 seconds. The second has Δt2 = 1e-8 seconds.

Calculating the uncertainty for each:

ΔE1 ≈ ħ / Δt1
ΔE2 ≈ ħ / Δt2

Since ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

But wait, the units here are in eV. Oh right, because the options are in eV. So I should probably convert ħ into eV·s.

I remember that 1 eV is 1.60218e-19 J. So ħ in eV·s is:

ħ = 1.0545718e-34 J·s * (1 eV / 1.60218e-19 J)
≈ 1.0545718e-34 / 1.60218e-19 eV·s
≈ 6.582e-16 eV·s

So ħ ≈ 6.582e-16 eV·s.

So ΔE1 = ħ / Δt1 = (6.582e-16 eV·s) / (1e-9 s) = 6.582e-7 eV.

Wait wait, 6.582e-16 divided by 1e-9 is 6.582e-7 eV. So that's about 6.582e-7 eV.

Similarly, ΔE2 = ħ / Δt2 = (6.582e-16) / (1e-8) = 6.582e-8 eV.

Wait, no. Let me recalculate:

Wait, 6.582e-16 divided by 1e-8 is 6.582e-8 eV. Because 1e-8 is larger, so division leads to a smaller exponent.

So, ΔE1 is about 6.58e-7 eV, and ΔE2 is about 6.58e-8 eV.

So the energy difference between E2 and E1 needs to be larger than the sum of their uncertainties? Or just larger than each individually? Hmm.

Wait, when you have two states, their energy levels' resolution requires that the energy difference is larger than the uncertainty in each. Because if the difference is smaller than either uncertainty, the lines might overlap.

But wait, I think that the energy difference should be larger than the sum of the uncertainties. Because each state has some uncertainty, so the separation must be more than both to resolve them.

Alternatively, maybe the energy difference should be larger than the larger of the two uncertainties. Because the larger uncertainty would dictate the minimum separation needed.

Wait, that's another approach. Let me think about this. For example, if you have two states, one with a broader peak (larger ΔE) and another with a narrower peak (smaller ΔE), the resolving condition would be that the energy difference is greater than the sum of their half-widths. Or in some cases, the difference should be greater than the largest half-width.

Wait, no. The usual condition for resolving two lines is that the distance between them (ΔE) must be greater than the sum of their half-widths. Because if the separation is less than the sum, the lines might overlap and not be distinguishable.

So the separation ΔE = E2 - E1 should be greater than ΔE1 + ΔE2.

Wait, but wait, in the context of energy levels, the uncertainty in each energy is about how precisely we can measure it. So for the two levels to be distinguishable, the separation between them must be larger than the sum of their uncertainties. Because if it's smaller, the measurements could overlap, making it impossible to tell them apart.

So in our case, ΔE >= ΔE1 + ΔE2.

Wait, no, wait. The separation must be greater than the sum of the individual uncertainties because if the separation is equal to the sum, the lines just touch each other, but perhaps you can't resolve them. So better to have the separation greater than the sum.

So let's compute ΔE1 + ΔE2.

ΔE1 is approximately 6.58e-7 eV, and ΔE2 is 6.58e-8 eV.

Adding them together: 6.58e-7 + 0.658e-7 = 7.238e-7 eV.

So the energy difference between E2 and E1 must be greater than 7.238e-7 eV.

Looking at the options:

Option A is 1e-9 eV = 0.001e-7 eV. That's way smaller than 7e-7, so no good.

Option B is 1e-11 eV. Also way too small.

Option C is 1e-4 eV. That's 0.1e-3 eV, which is 1e-4 = 0.0001 eV. Wait, 1e-4 eV is 0.1e-3 eV. Wait, 1e-4 is 0.0001, and 7.238e-7 is about 0.0000007238 eV. So 1e-4 eV is 0.0001, which is way larger than 0.0000007238. So it's way bigger. So if the energy difference is 1e-4 eV, which is larger than 7e-7, then it would be resolvable.

Option D is 1e-8 eV. 1e-8 is 0.00000001 eV, which is smaller than 7e-7. So that's not sufficient.

So the only option that is larger than 7e-7 eV is option C, which is 1e-4 eV.

So the correct answer is option C.

To determine the energy difference required to clearly distinguish two quantum states with energies \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \), we use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. The principle states that the product of the uncertainty in energy (\( \Delta E \)) and the uncertainty in time (\( \Delta t \)) is approximately \( \hbar / 2 \), where \( \hbar \) is the reduced Planck's constant. For a given lifetime (\( \Delta t \)), the uncertainty in energy is given by:

\[
\Delta E \approx \frac{\hbar}{\Delta t}.
\]

The lifetimes of the two states are \( \Delta t_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \) and \( \Delta t_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \). Using \( \hbar \approx 6.582 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{eV·s} \), we calculate the uncertainties in energy for each state:

\[
\Delta E_1 = \frac{\hbar}{\Delta t_1} = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-16}}{10^{-9}} = 6.582 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV},
\]
\[
\Delta E_2 = \frac{\hbar}{\Delta t_2} = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-16}}{10^{-8}} = 6.582 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}.
\]

To resolve the two energy levels, the energy difference \( \Delta E = E_2 - E_1 \) must be greater than the sum of the uncertainties in energy:

\[
\Delta E > \Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2.
\]

Adding the uncertainties:

\[
\Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2 = 6.582 \times 10^{-7} + 6.582 \times 10^{-8} = 7.238 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
\]

Thus, the energy difference must be greater than \( 7.238 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Evaluating the options:

- **Option A:** \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} = 0.001 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), which is much smaller than \( 7.238 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \).
- **Option B:** \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \), which is also much smaller than \( 7.238 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \).
- **Option C:** \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} = 0.0001 \, \text{eV} \), which is much larger than \( 7.238 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \).
- **Option D:** \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} = 0.00000001 \, \text{eV} \), which is smaller than \( 7.238 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \).

The only option that satisfies the condition is **Option C**. Therefore, the energy difference must be at least \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \) to clearly distinguish the two energy levels.
