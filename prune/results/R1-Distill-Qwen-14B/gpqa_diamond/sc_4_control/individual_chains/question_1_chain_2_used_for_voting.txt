Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here, and I'm a bit rusty, but let me think through it. The question is about two quantum states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds. We need to find their energy difference so they can be clearly resolved.

Hmm, wait, I remember something about the uncertainty principle relating energy and time. Oh right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. The formula is ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. But wait, I think the exact form might be ΔE * τ ≥ ħ/2, where τ is the lifetime. Or is it the other way around? Oh right, the time here is the uncertainty in the lifetime, which relates to how precisely we can measure the energy.

So the idea is that the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) is inversely proportional to the lifetime (τ). The longer the lifetime, the more precisely the energy is known, so the smaller the ΔE. Oh wait, but in this question, we have two states with different lifetimes. Wait, no, the question is about the energy difference between the two states, not the uncertainty in each state's energy. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, the question says the two states have energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are τ1 and τ2, which are 1e-9 s and 1e-8 s. We need to find the energy difference ΔE=E2-E1 such that they can be clearly distinguished.

Wait, but how does the lifetime affect the energy difference needed for them to be resolved? Oh, perhaps the energy difference must be greater than the uncertainty in energy for each state, so that their signals don't overlap. Alternatively, maybe each state's uncertainty is determined by their own lifetime, and the energy difference must be larger than the sum of their uncertainties.

Wait, maybe the energy difference should be larger than the sum of the uncertainties from each state. Because if the energy difference is smaller than that, then their uncertainties might overlap, making it hard to tell them apart.

So let me compute the uncertainties for each state. For each, ΔE_i ≈ ħ / (2 τ_i). So calculate each.

The reduced Planck constant ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s. But since the options are in eV, perhaps it's better to convert J to eV. I remember that 1 eV is about 1.602e-19 joules. So let's compute each ΔE.

First, compute for τ1 = 1e-9 s.

ΔE1 = ħ/(2 τ1) = (1.0545718e-34 J·s) / (2 * 1e-9 s) ) = 1.0545718e-34 / 2e-9 = approx 5.27e-26 J.

Convert J to eV: 5.27e-26 J / (1.602e-19 J/eV) ≈ 3.29e-7 eV. So about 3.29e-7 eV.

Similarly for τ2 = 1e-8 s:

ΔE2 = ħ/(2 τ2) = 1.0545718e-34 / (2e-8) = 5.27e-27 J.

Convert to eV: 5.27e-27 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 3.29e-8 eV.

So the uncertainties are approximately 3.29e-7 eV and 3.29e-8 eV for the two states.

Wait, but I'm not sure if it's the sum or the difference or which one matters. The question is about the energy difference ΔE between E2 and E1 being enough to be resolved.

Wait, perhaps the energy difference ΔE should be greater than the sum of the two uncertainties. Because otherwise, the peaks (if you think of them as spectral lines) might overlap and you can't tell them apart. So ΔE must be greater than (ΔE1 + ΔE2).

Wait, but wait, no. Let me think again. The uncertainty in each energy level is about how precisely we can measure it. If the energies are E1 and E2, the uncertainty for each is ΔE1 and ΔE2, respectively. For these two states to be clearly distinguishable, the separation between E2 and E1 must be greater than the sum of their uncertainties. Because if E2-E1 is less than the sum, the intervals might overlap, making it hard to tell.

Alternatively, perhaps it's just greater than the individual uncertainty of the shorter-lived state. Because the shorter the lifetime, the larger the uncertainty. Let me see.

Wait, τ1 is 1e-9 s, which is shorter than τ2's 1e-8 s. So ΔE1 is about 3.29e-7 eV and ΔE2 is about 3.29e-8 eV. So ΔE1 is larger than ΔE2. So the uncertainty for E1 is bigger.

So the energy difference ΔE must be greater than ΔE1 plus ΔE2. Let me compute that.

ΔE1 = 3.29e-7 eV; ΔE2 = 3.29e-8 eV. Sum is approximately 3.62e-7 eV.

So the energy difference needs to be larger than about 3.6e-7 eV for the two states to be clearly distinguishable.

Looking at the options:

A) 1e-9 eV → 0.001e-6 → 1e-9 eV is way smaller than 3.6e-7 eV. So this is too small.

B) 1e-11 eV → even smaller. So no.

C) 1e-4 eV → 0.0001 eV. That's 1e-4 eV, which is 1e-4 = 1e-4, which is much larger than 3.6e-7. So this would work.

D) 1e-8 eV → 0.00000001 eV. 1e-8 is 0.001e-6, which is 0.001 times 1e-6, but 3.6e-7 is about 0.36e-6. So 1e-8 is 0.01e-7, which is 0.00001 eV. Hmm, 1e-8 eV is 0.00000001 eV, which is 0.01e-6 eV. Wait, 3.6e-7 is 0.36e-6, so 0.36e-6 is larger than 0.01e-6 (1e-8). So 1e-8 is too small.

So the only option that's larger than the sum of the uncertainties is option C, 1e-4 eV.

Wait, but wait a second. What if the energy difference only needs to be greater than the uncertainty of the state with the smaller ΔE? Or perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy difference ΔE must be greater than the individual ΔE for each state. Because if ΔE is smaller than either, then perhaps the states can't be resolved.

Wait, but the sum is larger than either. So if ΔE is greater than the sum, then it's definitely greater than each. So in that case, the correct answer would be option C, but let me check the numbers again.

Wait, the required ΔE is around 3.6e-7 eV. Looking at the options, option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 1e-4, which is 0.0001 eV. That's larger than 3.6e-7, which is 0.00000036 eV. So yes, option C would be sufficient.

So the correct answer is option C.

To determine the energy difference required for two quantum states with energies \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \) to be clearly distinguishable, we use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, which relates the uncertainty in energy (\( \Delta E \)) to the lifetime (\( \tau \)) of the state: 

\[
\Delta E \approx \frac{\hbar}{2\tau},
\]

where \( \hbar \) is the reduced Planck constant (\( \hbar \approx 1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \)). The energy difference between the two states must be greater than the sum of their uncertainties in energy to ensure they can be clearly resolved.

### Step 1: Calculate the uncertainties for each state
For the first state with \( \tau_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \):
\[
\Delta E_1 = \frac{\hbar}{2\tau_1} = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}}{2 \times 10^{-9}} \approx 5.27 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J}.
\]
Convert to electron volts (\( 1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)):
\[
\Delta E_1 \approx \frac{5.27 \times 10^{-26}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 3.29 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
\]

For the second state with \( \tau_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \):
\[
\Delta E_2 = \frac{\hbar}{2\tau_2} = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}}{2 \times 10^{-8}} \approx 5.27 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J}.
\]
Convert to electron volts:
\[
\Delta E_2 \approx \frac{5.27 \times 10^{-27}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 3.29 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}.
\]

### Step 2: Determine the required energy difference
To ensure the two states are distinguishable, the energy difference \( \Delta E = E_2 - E_1 \) must be greater than the sum of the uncertainties:
\[
\Delta E > \Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2.
\]
\[
\Delta E > 3.29 \times 10^{-7} + 3.29 \times 10^{-8} \approx 3.62 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
\]

### Step 3: Evaluate the options
- **Option A: \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \) is much smaller than \( 3.62 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so this is too small.

- **Option B: \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \) is also much smaller than \( 3.62 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so this is too small.

- **Option C: \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} = 0.0001 \, \text{eV} \), which is much larger than \( 3.62 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). This satisfies the condition.

- **Option D: \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \) is smaller than \( 3.62 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so this is too small.

### Conclusion
The only option that satisfies the condition for the energy difference to be clearly distinguishable is **Option C**.
