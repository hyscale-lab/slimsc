Okay, so I'm trying to solve this biology question about a ligand-receptor pair expressed in neural crest cells. Hmm, from what I remember, ligands and receptors are involved in signaling, right? The question is about why the eGFP isn't showing up under the microscope after crossing with SOX10-Cre mice.

Wait, let's break down the problem. So they created a bicistronic vector, which means it has two ORFs in one construct. The ligand is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry, and the receptor is at the 3' end, fused to eGFP. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, and the receptor has an IRES upstream. So the CBA promoter would drive the expression of both the ligand and the receptor because IRES allows internal ribosome entry, meaning the receptor can be expressed as a separate protein after the ligand.

But wait, the vectors have stop cassettes. Between ligand and mCherry, there's a loxP-stop-loxP cassette, and between receptor and eGFP, it's lox2272-stop-lox2272. Oh right, the Cre/Lox system is used to excise these stop cassettes. So when Cre is present, it recombines the lox sites and deletes the stop, allowing the downstream reporter (mCherry or eGFP) to be expressed.

In this case, they used SOX10-Cre mice. SOX10 is expressed in neural crest cells, so the Cre should be active there. That would excise the loxP stops in the ligand construct and the lox2272 stops in the receptor construct, allowing both mCherry and eGFP to be expressed.

But in the experiment, when they looked for green (eGFP), they didn't see it. So why?

Looking at the options:

Option A: Ligand and receptor are paracrine. Paracrine means they act on nearby cells. But the problem says they're expressed in neural crest cells, and maybe the Cre is working, but expression might not depend on whether they're paracrine or not. So not sure about this.

Option B: Receptor-eGFP stuck in the Golgi. The Golgi is where proteins are processed. If it's stuck there, maybe it's not secreted or not on the membrane. But why wouldn't it be expressed? The Western blot result would have shown if the protein was made, but the question mentions using antibodies against overexpressed proteins. So if the construct isn't working, maybe the protein isn't made, but the Western blot uses total proteins, which would detect it. Wait, the Western blot showed the signal proportional to actin, implying that the loading is correct. But the blot results aren't described. Hmm, maybe the Western blot wasn't the issue here.

Option C: Enhancer for expression is missing. The ligand is under CBA promoter, which is a strong promoter. The receptor uses IRES, which doesn't require a promoter for the second gene. So maybe the issue is that the enhancer is missing, but the CBA should provide sufficient promoter strength. Alternatively, perhaps without the Cre, the stop remains, but in this case, the Cre is present because it's SOX10-Cre.

Option D: Receptor and eGFP not in frame. Oh, wait, the vector has the receptor ORF followed by a stop cassette and then eGFP. But the way the vector is set up, the stop cassettes are between the ORFs and the reporters. So when Cre is active, the stop is removed, and the eGFP should be expressed in frame with the receptor. If they're not in frame, then the eGFP might not be correctly fused, leading to no expression or a truncated protein that isn't fluorescent. Alternatively, if the ORFs are in the same reading frame, then the eGFP would be correctly expressed. But if the vector wasn't constructed correctly, perhaps the receptor and eGFP are not in frame, so when the stop is removed, the eGFP isn't expressed. That would mean no green signal.

Alternatively, maybe the stop cassette in the receptor construct might have a stop codon in frame, so when the stop is removed, the eGFP is in frame. But if the lox2272 cassette is in frame with the receptor, then when the stop is excised, the eGFP would be in frame with the receptor. If the eGFP is not in frame, it might not be expressed or might lead to a premature stop codon.

Wait, the original setup: the ligand is in the 5' ORF, then a stop with loxP, then mCherry. The receptor is after IRES, then a stop with lox2272, then eGFP.

Wait, no. The vector is bicistronic, meaning the first ORF is the ligand, and the second is the receptor. The ligand is under CBA promoter, followed by the first stop cassette (loxP), then mCherry. The receptor is after IRES, then a stop cassette (lox2272), then eGFP. But no, the way it's written is ligand ORF (5') fused with mCherry but with a stop cassette in between. So the ligand is first, then a stop, and then mCherry. But only when Cre is present, the stop is removed, so ligand and mCherry are co-expressed.

Similarly, the receptor is followed by a stop cassette, then eGFP. So when the Cre is active, the stop is removed, so receptor and eGFP are co-expressed. But wait, the loxP and lox2272 are different sites, so the same Cre would act on both.

But in the mice, they used SOX10-Cre, which would excise both stop cassettes. So both mCherry and eGFP should be expressed.

But the question is that the eGFP is not observed. So why?

Wait, the question states that the mice are homozygous for the construct. So each allele has the construct. Then, when crossed with SOX10-Cre, which is a hemizygous line, the Cre would be active in neural crest-derived cells. So in those cells, both the ligand and receptor should be expressed, along with their respective fluorescent markers.

But no green signal (eGFP) was observed. So possible reasons:

- The Cre isn't active, so the stop cassette remains, so the eGFP isn't expressed.

But SOX10 is expressed in neural crest, so Cre should have been active.

- The vector wasn't correctly recombined. Perhaps the lox2272 sites weren't correctly recognized. Maybe the Cre isn't working properly, or the sites are mutated.

But the antibodies against the overexpressed proteins were used in Western blot. So perhaps the proteins were expressed, but the GFP wasn't. Wait, but the Western blot is done after transfection to primary astrocyte culture. Oh, wait, that's a separate experiment. The mouse model is a separate thing.

Wait, the question says that after the offspring is born, they visualize under confocal. So the mouse model is the one crossed with SOX10-Cre. The initial Western blot was a separate experiment to test the construct's expression.

Wait, but the mouse model is homozygous for the construct, which is in the wild-type background. So each allele has the construct: ligand with mCherry and receptor with eGFP, both under the control of the stop cassettes.

When they cross with SOX10-Cre, the Cre would excise the stops in both alleles. So in the offspring, the ligand and mCherry should be co-expressed, and receptor and eGFP should be co-expressed.

But why no eGFP?

Another possibility is that the IRES isn't working. The IRES is after the receptor's ORF, allowing it to be expressed as a separate protein. But if the IRES doesn't function, perhaps the eGFP isn't being expressed. Alternatively, maybe the eGFP is under a different promoter that isn't active.

Alternatively, perhaps the eGFP is not in frame. Let me think about the vector structure. The vector has the ligand ORF, followed by a stop cassette, then mCherry. Then, for the receptor, there's an IRES, followed by the receptor ORF, then a stop cassette, then eGFP.

Wait, no. Wait, the vector is bicistronic, meaning it has two ORFs. So the first ORF is ligand under CBA promoter, followed by a stop cassette. Then the second ORF is the receptor, which is under the control of an IRES. So the IRES allows the receptor to be expressed after the ligand ORF.

Wait, perhaps the stop cassette for the receptor is between the receptor ORF and eGFP. So the structure would be: CBA promoter -> ligand ORF -> loxP-stop-loxP -> mCherry ORF; followed by IRES -> receptor ORF -> lox2272-stop-lox2272 -> eGFP ORF.

In that case, when Cre is present, the loxP sites are recombined, removing the stop cassettes. So ligand and mCherry are co-expressed, and receptor and eGFP are co-expressed.

But if the eGFP isn't expressed, perhaps the issue is in the frame. Because the stop cassette is in the same frame as the eGFP. If the stop is in frame, then the stop codon would prevent eGFP expression. But when Cre excises the stop, the eGFP should be in frame.

Wait, but the stop cassettes have a stop codon. So, unless the stop is removed, the downstream eGFP isn't expressed. But if the vector didn't have the stop correctly flanked by lox sites, then the stop might remain, preventing eGFP expression.

But in this case, the Cre was used (because the mice are crossed with SOX10-Cre), so the stops should be removed.

Hmm, another angle: The IRES might not be working. If the IRES isn't functional, the receptor may not be expressed, but that would affect the ligand as well? Or perhaps the eGFP is not being translated because of a frameshift.

Wait, the options: option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. Oh, wait, maybe the vector was designed so that the receptor and eGFP are in frame when the stop is removed. If they are not in frame, then the eGFP would not be correctly expressed, resulting in no green signal.

Wait, the construct: after the receptor ORF, there's a stop cassette which, when removed, allows the eGFP to be expressed. So the eGFP is in the same reading frame as the receptor ORF? No, wait, probably not. The stop cassette would typically be in frame, so that when it's removed, the eGFP is in frame.

Ah, but if the stop cassette in the receptor-eGFP part is in frame, then when Cre deletes the stop, the eGFP would be in frame with the receptor. But the receptor is a transmembrane protein, so the eGFP would be a fusion protein after the receptor. But if the reading frame isn't correct, the eGFP might not be expressed.

Wait, but the eGFP is after the stop cassette. So the vector is designed as Receptor gene followed by a stop cassette (lox2272), then eGFP. So when Cre deletes the stop, the eGFP is expressed in frame with the receptor ORF. If the reading frame is not correct, then the eGFP won't be expressed.

So if the stop was in frame, and the eGFP is in a different frame, the eGFP won't be expressed. So that would be option D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame.

Alternatively, perhaps the IRES is causing a problem. The IRES is between the ligand and the receptor, but IRESs are used to allow the translation of the second gene without a Kozak sequence or other promoter elements. So perhaps the IRES isn't working, but that's not one of the options.

Wait, another possibility: the enhancer for the construct is missing. The ligand is under CBA promoter, which is a strong constitutive promoter. But the receptor is under the control of IRES, which doesn't require a promoter, but maybe the IRES isn't active. Or maybe the enhancer is missing, leading to low expression of the receptor and eGFP. But option C says the enhancer is missing, but the CBA is a strong promoter, so maybe enhancers aren't the issue.

Alternatively, perhaps the vectors are not correctly expressed in the neural crest cells. For instance, the CBA promoter might not be active in those cells. Oh, but CBA is a strong, constitutive promoter, so that might not be the case.

Back to the options. The most likely reason is either B, C, D, or A. But A is about paracrine vs. endocrine signaling. If the ligand and receptor are paracrine, that would mean they act locally, but the construct is in the same cell. If the Cre isn't active, but in this case, the Cre is under SOX10, which is active in neural crest.

So I think the issue is with the eGFP not being expressed because it's not in frame. So in the vector, after the receptor ORF, the stop cassette is in frame, so when the Cre deletes the stop, the eGFP is in frame. If the cloning didn't put them in frame, then the eGFP won't be expressed, leading to no green signal.

Therefore, the correct answer is D: the receptor and the eGFP are not in the frame.

The question involves a bicistronic lox-Cre vector expressing a ligand and receptor pair in neural crest cells. The ligand is fused to mCherry, and the receptor is fused to eGFP. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, and the receptor is preceded by an IRES element. Stop cassettes (loxP for the ligand-mCherry and lox2272 for the receptor-eGFP) are present between the respective ORFs and fluorescent proteins. SOX10-Cre mice, which express Cre in neural crest cells, were used to excise the stop cassettes, allowing co-expression of the ligand-mCherry and receptor-eGFP. However, no green signal (eGFP) was observed under the confocal microscope.

### Analysis of Options:
1. **Option A (Ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship):**  
   Paracrine signaling refers to local action between nearby cells. However, the question focuses on the expression of the receptor-eGFP construct within the same cell, not its mode of action. This option does not explain the lack of eGFP expression.

2. **Option B (Receptor-eGFP is stuck in the Golgi):**  
   If the receptor-eGFP were stuck in the Golgi, it would likely still be synthesized and detected on Western blot. The absence of a green signal specifically under the confocal microscope suggests a problem with expression rather than trafficking. This option is unlikely.

3. **Option C (Enhancer for expression is missing):**  
   The ligand is under the CBA promoter, which is a strong constitutive promoter. The receptor is driven by an IRES, which does not require a promoter. While enhancers can influence expression, the absence of an enhancer is unlikely to completely prevent expression of both the ligand and receptor, especially since the construct was tested in primary astrocyte culture.

4. **Option D (Receptor and eGFP are not in frame):**  
   The vector design places the receptor ORF followed by a stop cassette, which is excised by Cre to allow co-expression of the receptor and eGFP. If the receptor and eGFP are not in the correct reading frame, the eGFP would not be expressed properly, leading to the observed lack of green signal. This is the most plausible explanation.

### Conclusion:
The absence of the green signal is most likely due to the receptor and eGFP not being in the correct reading frame, preventing proper expression of eGFP.
