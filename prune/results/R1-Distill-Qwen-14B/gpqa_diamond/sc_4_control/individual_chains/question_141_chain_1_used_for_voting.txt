Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to think it through. The question is about treating 1-bromobenzene-2-d with NaNH2 in a condensed ammonia solvent. I need to find out how many possible organic products there are.

Wait, wait, what's 1-bromobenzene-2-d? Oh, right, that's a benzene ring with a bromine substituent on the first carbon and a deuterium (D) on the second carbon. So the structure is benzene with Br at position 1 and D at position 2.

And the reagent is NaNH2 in condensed ammonia. I remember that NaNH2 is a strong base, often used in deprotonation reactions. In aromatic chemistry, especially with directing groups, this might lead to elimination or substitution?

Wait, wait, when NaNH2 is used in ammonia, it's a common condition for elimination reactions, like the formation of alkenes from toluenes through dehydrohalogenation. But wait, bromobenzene is an aromatic compound. So maybe this is about elimination from a side chain?

Wait, but 1-bromobenzene is bromobenzene, which is an aryl bromide. Aryl halides are generally not as reactive towards elimination as alkyl halides because the C-Br bond is stronger. Hmm, but wait, maybe if the ring has substituents that can stabilize a charge?

Wait, the molecule here is 1-bromo-2-d benzene. So the ring has a Br at position 1 and a D (deuterium) at position 2. So positions 1 and 2 are adjacent.

Wait, but in benzene, positions 1 and 2 are adjacent, and considering the substituents, does this affect the reaction? Or perhaps the D is in a position that can influence the reaction.

Wait, what's the reaction here? NaNH2 is a strong base, so maybe it abstracts a proton to form a benzene ring with a negative charge, leading to a substitution. Or perhaps it's a nucleophilic aromatic substitution.

Wait, but bromobenzene is generally not very reactive towards substitution unless under specific conditions. But wait, maybe the deuterium is a substituent that can influence the reaction.

Hold on, I'm a bit rusty on this. Let me think again. So NaNH2 in ammonia is a strong base. In the case of aryl halides, under basic conditions, perhaps it abstracts a proton beta to the bromine, leading to the formation of a benzyn intermediate. Oh wait, benzynes are aryne intermediates formed via dehydrohalogenation of bromobenzenes. That's right, when an aryl halide undergoes elimination to form an aryne.

Wait, but for that, the aryl halide needs to have a hydrogen adjacent to the halide. So in bromobenzene, if there's a hydrogen adjacent, then elimination can occur. But in bromobenzene, the structure is a benzene ring with a Br. If the Br is in position 1, then position 2 would be adjacent. If position 2 has a D (deuterium), then there's no H there. Oh wait, but wait, maybe the D is in position 2, but are there other H's adjacent?

Wait, maybe I got the structure wrong. 1-bromobenzene-2-d: the benzene ring has a Br on carbon 1, and a D on carbon 2. So the Br is at position 1, and adjacent to it is position 2, which has D. So the only adjacent H would be on position 3, perhaps? Wait, no, benzene is a ring, so each position is connected to two others. So for position 1, adjacent positions are 2 and 6. If position 2 has D, then position 6 has H. So wait, if the Br is on C1, and C2 has D, then the H on C6 is adjacent to Br.

So, when NaNH2 is added, it could deprotonate a hydrogen adjacent to the Br, leading to the formation of a benzyn (aryne) intermediate. But in this case, the only adjacent H is on C6 because C2 is deuterated (so no H there). So the base (NH2^-) would abstract the H from C6, leading to the formation of a triple bond between C1 and C2, but wait, C2 has D. Wait, that can't be right.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think about the possible positions. The molecule is 1-bromo-2-d benzene. So, it's like:

Positions:
1: Br
2: D
3: H
4: H
5: H
6: H

Wait, no. The numbering is such that position 1 is Br, position 2 is D, and the other positions (3,4,5,6) are H.

Wait, but the benzene ring has six positions. So 1 is Br, 2 is D. Then positions 3 and 4 are across from each other, and 5 and 6 are next to D (position 2) and position 1 (Br).

Wait, maybe the structure is such that the Br is on carbon 1, and the D is on carbon 2, which is adjacent. So the adjacent carbons to Br are C2 and C6. But C2 has D, so only C6 has H adjacent to Br.

So, when NaNH2 acts as a base, it abstracts a proton that is beta to the Br, which in this case is the H on C6. So when the H on C6 is removed, the Br leaves, forming a triple bond between C1 and C2? Wait, but C2 has a D, not H. So the triple bond would be between C1 and C6? Or maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, wait, no. The elimination reaction in aryl halides typically forms a triple bond between the carbon where the halide was and the adjacent carbon from which the H was abstracted. So if the Br is on C1 and the H is abstracted from C2, then the triple bond would form between C1 and C2. But in this case, C2 has D, not H. So the H can't be abstracted from C2; it's deuterated. So the only available H is on C6, which is adjacent to C1 (Br) but not C2.

Wait, but wait, perhaps the position numbers are different. Maybe the substituents are in positions 1 and 2, making them adjacent. So the Br is at position 1, and D is at position 2. Then, the adjacent positions to Br would be 2 (D) and 6 (H). So, the base can abstract the H on position 6, leading to elimination between C1 and C6? No, because elimination is between C1 and C6? Wait, that doesn't make sense because they're across from each other.

Wait, maybe I should draw the benzene ring to visualize. Let's imagine the ring:

Positions 1 (Br), 2 (D), 3, 4, 5, 6.

In a benzene ring, position 1 is next to 2 and 6. So if the H at position 6 is abstracted, that's adjacent to Br. Then the Br leaves, and a triple bond forms between C1 and C6? But wait, that would form a triple bond across the ring, which is not possible because of the ring structure. Arynes are typically formed as six-membered rings with a triple bond in a position that allows for two adjacent carbons to have the triple bond.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. The benzene ring is flat, so the triple bond can't form across the ring. It must form between two adjacent carbons. So if the Br is on C1 and the H is on C2 (but C2 has D), then the H can't be abstracted. Alternatively, if the H is on C6, which is adjacent to C1, then elimination would form a triple bond between C1 and C6? But those are not adjacent on the ring. Wait, no, in benzene, C1 is adjacent to C2 and C6. So C6 is next to C1.

So, when the H on C6 is abstracted, and the Br leaves, the triple bond forms between C1 and C6. But wait, that's a possibility. So the aryne would have a triple bond between C1 and C6, making the positions 1 and 6 as the triple bond.

But then, when the aryne is formed, it can undergo addition reactions. Typically, benzynes can undergo [2+4] cycloaddition or other reactions, but in this case, since we're treating with NaNH2 in ammonia, perhaps it's an elimination followed by ring closure.

Wait, no, the question is about the reaction of 1-bromo-2-d benzene with NaNH2. The product would be the aryne, but how many products are formed?

Wait, but wait, the starting material is 1-bromo-2-d benzene. So when the base abstracts the H from position 6 (the only available H adjacent to Br), elimination occurs, leading to the formation of a triple bond between C1 and C6. But wait, that would leave the ring with a triple bond between C1 and C6, which are opposite each other in the ring? No, wait, in benzene, C1 and C6 are adjacent, right? Because the ring is cyclic. So C1 is connected to C2 and C6. So the triple bond between C1 and C6 would make a ring with a triple bond in the ortho position relative to the D.

Wait, but in this case, would the elimination lead to a single product (since only one H is available for abstraction), or could there be more than one product?

Wait, if the H is only available on C6, then elimination would lead to a single product, the aryl dideutero compound with a triple bond between C1 and C6. But then, what about other possible positions? Alternatively, can the D on C2 influence the reaction in a way that gives more products?

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is not elimination but substitution. But bromobenzene doesn't typically undergo substitution under such conditions. Wait, but if it's a meta director, perhaps substitution occurs at another position?

Wait, but NaNH2 is a strong base, not a nucleophile. So substitution would require a good leaving group and a good nucleophile. In this case, the Br is a leaving group, but without a good nucleophile present, substitution is unlikely. So elimination is more plausible.

So the reaction would form the aryne (benzene with a triple bond between C1 and C6). But then, how does that affect the number of products?

Wait, the initial starting material is 1-bromo-2-d benzene. So after elimination, the product would be benzene with a triple bond between C1 and C6, and a D on C2. So that's one product. But wait, on the ring, the triple bond could be on either face, but in benzene, that's not possible because it's symmetric. So it would lead to a single product.

Wait, but wait, the aryne could form in a way that the triple bond is either between C1 and C2 or C1 and C6. But in this molecule, C2 has D, so the only possible elimination is from C6. So the product would have a triple bond between C1 and C6, and D at C2. So that's one product.

Alternatively, maybe the D is a substituent that affects the reaction pathway. But since D is a heavy isotope of H, perhaps it doesn't influence the reaction much. So the main product would be the aryne.

Wait, but wait, another possibility: maybe the elimination leads to the formation of two different products due to the position of the triple bond.

Wait, but in this case, elimination can only occur in one way because the only available H is on C6. So the triple bond would form between C1 and C6. So only one possible position for the triple bond.

So the product would be a benzene ring with a triple bond between C1 and C6, and a D on C2. So that's only one product.

But wait, let me think again. Are there any other positions for elimination?

Wait, the Br is on C1. The H must be on an adjacent carbon to Br, so either C2 or C6. But C2 has D, so only C6 has H. So elimination leads to triple bond between C1 and C6. So only one product.

So the number of possible organic products would be one.

But wait, wait a second. Maybe the D is on C2, which is adjacent to C1 (Br) but can't donate a proton. So the only possible elimination is from C6, leading to a single product.

So the number of products is 1, which is option B.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed as elimination but as substitution. But under these conditions, substitution is less likely because NaNH2 is a strong base, not a nucleophile. Plus, aryl halides don't typically substitute under such conditions. So elimination to form the aryne is the main pathway.

So the only product would be the aryne, so the answer is option B) 1.

The reaction involves treating 1-bromobenzene-2-d (a benzene ring with a bromine atom at position 1 and a deuterium atom at position 2) with NaNH₂ in condensed ammonia. NaNH₂ is a strong base, and under these conditions, elimination reactions are favored. Specifically, the base abstracts a proton adjacent to the bromine atom, leading to the formation of an aryne intermediate via dehydrohalogenation.

In this molecule, the bromine atom is at position 1, and the deuterium atom is at position 2. The adjacent positions to the bromine are position 2 (which has a deuterium, not a hydrogen) and position 6 (which has a hydrogen). Since the hydrogen at position 6 is the only available proton for elimination, the base abstracts this hydrogen, resulting in the formation of a triple bond between positions 1 and 6. This produces a single aryne product with the triple bond between positions 1 and 6 and the deuterium at position 2.

There are no other possible elimination pathways because the deuterium at position 2 prevents elimination from that side of the ring. Therefore, only one product is formed in this reaction.
