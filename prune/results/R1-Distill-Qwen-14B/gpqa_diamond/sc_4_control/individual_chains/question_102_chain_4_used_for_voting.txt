Okay, so I've got this question about a scientific experiment involving a ligand-receptor pair, and I need to figure out why there's no green signal when they look at the mice. Hmm, let's try to break this down step by step.

First, let me read through the question again to make sure I understand the setup. So, there's a new ligand-receptor pair that's initially expressed in neural crest cells. The receptor is a monomeric transmembrane protein with eight alpha helices, four extracellular helices, and three beta sheets. The ligand is a coiled-coil with two alpha helices. 

They made a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. Wait, bicistronic means it has two genes in one vector, right? The ligand's ORF is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry. The receptor is at the 3' end, fused to eGFP at the C-terminus. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, and before the receptor, there's an IRES element. 

Wait, the vector setup is a bit confusing. So the vector has two main parts: the ligand and the receptor. The ligand is first, then a stop cassette (loxP-stop-loxP), then the receptor, which is under IRES, and another stop cassette (lox2272-stop-lox2272). 

They also made antibodies against these overexpressed proteins and tested with Western blot. The blot showed signals proportional to actin, which makes sense because they're normalizing loading. Then they made a mouse model that's homozygous for the construct in a wild-type background. They crossed these mice with SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice. Cre would recognize the loxP sites and delete the stop cassettes, allowing the genes to be expressed. Then they look for GFP under confocal, but see no green signal.

The options are A to D, and I need to figure out why the eGFP isn't showing up.

Let me think about how the vector works. The vector is bicistronic, so it's designed to express both the ligand and the receptor. But how the expression is controlled? The ligand is under CBA promoter, which is a strong promoter, and the receptor is under IRES. IRES allows for internal ribosome entry, meaning that the receptor might be expressed as a separate transcript after the ligand's, perhaps in a different cell type or condition. But with the stop cassettes, which are flanked by loxP or lox2272 sites.

Wait, the vector has a structure where the ligand is first: CBA promoter drives the ligand ORF, then a loxP-stop-loxP cassette, then the IRES, then the receptor ORF, which is followed by a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette.

In the absence of Cre, the stop cassettes would prevent the expression of both the ligand and the receptor, right? Because after the ligand's ORF, there's a stop with a loxP cassette, which would terminate transcription. Similarly for the receptor, the lox2272 would prevent expression.

But when Cre is introduced, it would delete the loxP and lox2272 cassettes. SOX10-Cre is a mouse model where Cre is expressed under the control of the SOX10 promoter, which is active in neural crest-derived cells, I think. So in the offspring, the Cre would delete the stop cassettes in the neural crest cells, allowing the ligand and receptor to be expressed.

Wait, but in the question, the mice are homozygous for the construct. Oh, but the SOX10-Cre is hemizygous. So the construct is in the mouse genome, and the Cre is in another line.

Now, in the offspring, the Cre would delete the stop cassettes, allowing expression. But why isn't the eGFP showing up?

Looking at the options:

Option A: Ligand and receptor are paracrine. Paracrine means they act on nearby cells. But why would that affect expression of the GFP? Maybe the ligand is secreted and acts on neighboring cells, but the construct is in the same cells, so the receptor should be expressed. But the eGFP is on the receptor, so if the receptor isn't expressed, GFP wouldn't show.

Option B: Receptor-eGFP stuck in Golgi. That would prevent it from being on the cell surface, so fluorescence wouldn't be detected. But why would that happen? If the construct is correctly made, it should traffic properly. Maybe the eGFP is after the receptor, so perhaps a stop codon or frame shift? Hmm, not sure.

Option C: Enhancer for ligand and receptor expression is missing. Both are under CBA and IRES, which are strong promoters. So if the enhancer is missing, they might not be expressed. But the vector includes these promoters, so this might not be the case. Unless the IRES isn't working, but IRES is a ribosome entry site, so it's more about allowing the second gene to be expressed from a single mRNA.

Option D: Receptor and eGFP not in frame. Oh wait, the receptor ORF is fused to eGFP at the C-terminus. So if the stop cassette between them wasn't correctly deleted, the receptor might not be expressed, or maybe the eGFP is not properly fused. But since the Cre was used, the lox2272 should have been deleted. Wait, the stop cassette is between the receptor and eGFP. So when Cre is active, it deletes the lox2272 cassette, allowing the receptor to be expressed along with eGFP. But if the eGFP is in frame, the protein would be a fusion. If it's not in frame, the eGFP might not be expressed, or the receptor might be truncated.

Wait, so the vector has the receptor ORF followed by the lox2272-stop cassette, then eGFP. Wait, no, the construct is ligand ORF (with stop loxP), then IRES, then receptor ORF, then lox2272-stop, then eGFP? Or is it the other way around? Wait, the question says: the ligand is at 5' position, fused to mCherry. The receptor is at 3' position, fused to eGFP. So the vector is:

Ligand (CBA promoter) --> stop loxP --> IRES --> Receptor (ORF) --> stop lox2272 --> eGFP.

Wait, that's a bit confusing. So perhaps the vector is designed so that the ligand is expressed under CBA, then a stop cassette, then an IRES that allows the receptor to be expressed as a separate transcript.

Wait, bicistronic vectors often have two cassettes: the first gene is under a promoter, followed by a stop, then an IRES, then the second gene. So in this case, the first cassette is ligand under CBA promoter, then loxP-stop, and the second is IRES followed by receptor-eGFP, followed by lox2272-stop.

Wait, no. Wait, the vector is bicistronic. So the structure would be:

CBA promoter --> Ligand ORF --> loxP-stop-loxP --> IRES --> Receptor ORF --> lox2272-stop-lox2272 --> eGFP.

Wait, but that might not make sense because the IRES is between the two ORFs. So when Cre is introduced, it would delete the loxP cassette (after ligand) and the lox2272 cassette (after receptor).

So in the presence of Cre, the ligand would be expressed (since the loxP-stop is removed), and the receptor-eGFP would be expressed because the lox2272-stop is removed.

But in the experiment, after crossing with SOX10-Cre, they didn't see any green signal. So the eGFP isn't being expressed.

Looking at the options again.

Option D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. That would mean that the eGFP isn't correctly expressed because it's not in the same reading frame as the receptor. But if the stop cassette is correctly deleted, the receptor and eGFP ORFs should be connected. If the eGFP is in a different frame, the mRNA might not code for a functional GFP, but perhaps the receptor would be expressed. But in the Western blot, they probably used an antibody against the receptor. Oh, but the question says they used antibodies against the overexpressed proteins and tested on Western blot after transfection. But it's the mice that are being tested for GFP.

Wait, the Western blot was done after plasmid transfection in primary astrocyte culture, but that's just the initial test. The mice are homozygous for the construct. So when they crossed them with SOX10-Cre, the Cre should delete the stop cassettes, allowing ligand and receptor to be expressed.

But the eGFP is on the receptor. So if the eGFP isn't in frame, perhaps the eGFP isn't being made. So the receptor is expressed, but without GFP. Or maybe the fusion protein isn't made, so the eGFP is not attached. So the eGFP would not fluoresce.

Alternatively, perhaps the frame is correct, but the absence of Cre would prevent expression, but here Cre is supposed to be present.

Wait, but the question states that the mice are homozygous for the construct. So they have the vector with the loxP and lox2272 stop cassettes. Then when crossed with SOX10-Cre, the Cre would delete the cassettes, allowing expression.

But if after that, the eGFP isn't expressed, perhaps the frame is wrong.

Wait, the vector after the receptor ORF has a stop cassette. So the vector without Cre would have the receptor followed by a stop. But with Cre, the stop is deleted, so the eGFP would be expressed.

Wait, no, wait: the vector design is: Ligand ORF --> loxP-stop --> IRES --> Receptor ORF --> lox2272-stop --> eGFP.

Wait, no, I think the vector is more likely:

Ligand (CBA promoter) --> stop [loxP-stop-loxP] --> IRES --> Receptor ORF --> eGFP [with stop lox2272-stop-lox2272].

Wait, that seems more likely. So the ligand is expressed under CBA, then a stop cassette. The IRES allows the receptor and eGFP to be expressed. Oh wait, perhaps the IRES is upstream of the receptor, so the mRNA is made from the CBA promoter, includes the ligand, then the stop is in between. Then, the IRES would allow translation of the receptor and eGFP. But I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the vector is designed so that the ligand is under CBA, then a stop, then an IRES which drives the expression of the receptor and eGFP as a single transcript. Wait, but the IRES is an internal ribosome entry site, so it allows the second gene to be translated from the same mRNA.

Wait, bicistronic vectors often have two ORFs in the same transcript with a promoter and then a first ORF, followed by an IRES, then the second ORF. So in this case, maybe the vector is:

CBA promoter --> Ligand ORF --> loxP-stop --> IRES --> Receptor ORF --> eGFP.

Wait, no, the loxP-stop would terminate the first ORF, but the IRES would allow the second ORF to be translated.

Wait, perhaps the vector is designed so that without Cre, the stop cassettes prevent expression. With Cre, the stops are removed, so the two genes are expressed.

So when Cre deletes the loxP and lox2272 cassettes, the ligand is expressed under CBA, and the IRES allows the receptor-eGFP to be expressed as a separate ORF.

But in the case of the mouse, perhaps the ligand and receptor are only expressed in the neural crest (since SOX10-Cre is active there), so the expression should happen in those cells.

But then why isn't the eGFP showing up?

Option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. So perhaps the stop cassette wasn't correctly removed, or the eGFP is in a different frame. Alternatively, perhaps the eGFP is in frame, but the fusion isn't correct.

Wait, another possibility: the eGFP is at the C-terminus of the receptor. If the stop is not removed, the eGFP won't be expressed. But with Cre, the stop should be removed.

But in the question, they used SOX10-Cre, which is only active in neural crest-derived cells. So perhaps the expression is happening correctly, but the eGFP isn't showing because the construct is not in the right orientation.

Wait, another thought: the IRES might not be functional. IRES elements are usually cell-type specific. If the IRES doesn't work in the cells where Cre is active, then the receptor and eGFP won't be expressed. But the IRES is supposed to drive expression of the second gene, so if it's not working, both the ligand and receptor wouldn't be expressed. But in the question, they were able to get a signal on the Western blot, implying that the ligand and receptor are being expressed.

Wait, but the Western blot was done after transfecting the plasmid into astrocyte cultures. So in that case, the plasmid would be expressed without Cre, but since the stop cassettes are present, the ligand would be expressed (because the stop is after the ligand) but the receptor wouldn't. Unless the IRES allows some leaky expression.

But the main issue is that in the mouse, after Cre is introduced, the eGFP isn't showing up. So the problem might be that the eGFP isn't being expressed. So why?

Another possibility: the eGFP is in the same reading frame as the receptor. If the lox2272 cassette is not correctly removed, the eGFP won't be expressed because the stop codon is still in place. But if Cre is active, the stops should be removed.

Wait, the vector uses loxP and lox2272, which are different recognition sites for Cre. So the loxP sites are recognized by Cre, but the lox2272 sites are recognized by a different Cre variant, perhaps? No, I think lox2272 is a variant of the loxP site, also recognized by Cre but with a different recombination preference. So when Cre is introduced, both loxP and lox2272 sites would be excised.

So the stop cassettes would be removed, allowing the eGFP to be expressed.

But if the eGFP is not in frame, perhaps the GFP isn't produced. So the receptor is expressed, but the eGFP is not, leading to no fluorescence.

So of the options, D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. That would mean that when the stop is removed, the eGFP is not correctly inserted into the same reading frame as the receptor, so the eGFP isn't functional, and perhaps isn't even expressed.

Alternatively, perhaps the eGFP is in frame, but the fusion protein isn't made correctly, but that's a different issue.

Wait, another thought: maybe the vector has the eGFP after the receptor, but without the stop cassette being removed, the eGFP isn't expressed. But if Cre deletes the stop, it should be expressed.

Alternatively, maybe the vector's design is such that the eGFP is not expressed. Oh, wait, the vector's design: the receptor is at 3' and fused to eGFP. So the ORF is Receptor-eGFP. But if the lox2272 cassette is between them, the eGFP is not part of the same ORF as the receptor unless the stop is removed.

Ah, wait, perhaps the construct is ligand followed by a stop, then IRES, then receptor followed by stop, then eGFP. So the stop between receptor and eGFP is the lox2272 cassette. So when Cre is present, it deletes the lox2272, allowing the receptor and eGFP to be in the same ORF. But if the eGFP is in a different reading frame, the fusion won't be correct. So when Cre deletes the stop, the eGFP is not in frame, so it's not expressed.

So in that case, the eGFP wouldn't be expressed, so no green signal.

Looking at the options again, option D states that the receptor and eGFP are not in frame, which would explain why the eGFP isn't detected.

Another possibility is option B: the receptor-eGFP is stuck in the Golgi. But why would that happen? It's a transmembrane protein, so if the GFP is on the extracellular side, it should traffic to the cell surface. If it's stuck, perhaps due to a mutation or incorrect signal, but that's less likely given the setup.

Option C: enhancer missing. But the promoters are CBA and IRES, so enhancers are probably not the issue here.

Option A: ligand and receptor are paracrine. So the ligand is secreted and acts on neighboring cells. But the eGFP is on the receptor, which would be in the same cells. So why wouldn't the GFP show up? Unless the ligand acts on other cells, but the GFP is in the same cell as the Cre activity, so that shouldn't affect it.

So the most likely option is D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame, leading to the eGFP not being expressed.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves a bicistronic lox-Cre vector designed to express a ligand and a receptor-eGFP fusion protein. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, followed by a loxP-stop-loxP cassette, and the receptor-eGFP is under an IRES element with a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette downstream. SOX10-Cre mice were used to delete the stop cassettes, enabling expression of the ligand and receptor-eGFP. However, no green signal was observed under confocal microscopy after crossing the mice.

### Key Analysis of the Options:

1. **Option A: Ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship**  
   This option suggests that the ligand acts on neighboring cells, but the eGFP is on the receptor, which should be expressed in the same cells as the Cre activity. There is no reason why a paracrine relationship would prevent eGFP expression in the same cell. This option does not explain the lack of fluorescence.

2. **Option B: The receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi**  
   For a transmembrane protein like the receptor, proper trafficking to the cell surface is expected if the construct is correctly designed. There is no evidence provided in the question to suggest that the receptor-eGFP is mislocalized or retained in the Golgi. This explanation is unlikely.

3. **Option C: The enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing**  
   The ligand is under the CBA promoter, and the receptor is under the IRES element, both of which are strong regulatory elements. The absence of an enhancer is not consistent with the vector design, which includes these promoters. This option does not adequately explain the lack of eGFP expression.

4. **Option D: The receptor and eGFP are not in frame**  
   The vector design places the receptor ORF followed by the lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette, which is supposed to be deleted by Cre to allow expression of the receptor-eGFP fusion. If the eGFP is not in the same reading frame as the receptor after the stop cassette is removed, the eGFP would not be expressed correctly. This would result in no green signal, as observed in the experiment. This is the most plausible explanation.

### Conclusion:
The lack of a green signal is most likely due to the receptor and eGFP not being in the same reading frame after the lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette is removed by Cre. This prevents proper expression of the eGFP, leading to the observed result.
