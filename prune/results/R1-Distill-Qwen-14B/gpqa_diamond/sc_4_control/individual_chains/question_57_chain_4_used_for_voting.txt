Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me about elastic scattering of electrons from a nuclear target. The question is about calculating the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. Hmm, I remember that scattering amplitudes are related to things like cross-sections and phase shifts, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formulas.

The problem gives me the phase shifts δ₀, δ₁, δ₂, δ₃, and δ₄ as 90°, 67°, 55°, 30°, and 13° respectively. Oh, wait, and the energy is 50 MeV electrons. Oh, but the question says to ignore the rest of the phase shifts, so I only consider up to δ₄.

I think the scattering amplitude f(θ) for elastic scattering is given by a series involving the Legendre polynomials and the phase shifts. The formula I recall is something like f(θ) = (1/k) * Σ ( (2l + 1) * (δ_l) * P_l(cosθ) ) where l is the orbital angular momentum quantum number, and P_l are the Legendre polynomials.

Wait, but the question is specifically asking for the imaginary part along the incident beam direction. So that's θ=0°, right? Because along the beam direction, the scattering angle is zero.

At θ=0°, the cosine is 1. So P_l(1) is 1 for all l, since P_0(x)=1 and all higher P_l(1)=1 as well. Wait, no, wait. Wait, for l=0, P_0(x)=1. For l=1, P_1(x)=x. So P_1(1)=1. l=2, P_2(1)= (3x²-1)/2, which gives (3-1)/2=1. So yeah, all P_l(1)=1. So when θ=0°, each term in the sum becomes (2l+1) * δ_l * 1.

So the scattering amplitude f(0) is (1/k) * Σ (2l+1)*δ_l, but wait, the phase shifts are given in degrees. Oh wait, wait: phase shifts are in degrees, but when using them in the formula, I think they should be in radians. Because in physics formulas, angles are usually in radians.

Wait, but wait, I'm not sure if phase shifts are in degrees or radians. In the formula for the scattering amplitude, the phase shifts are treated as angles in whatever units they are given, but when using in formulas involving trigonometric functions, they need to be in radians. Or maybe not, because in the formula, the phase shifts are multiplied by P_l, which is a polynomial, not a trigonometric function. Wait, no, the formula for f(θ) is:

f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) * Σ ( (2l+1) [ e^{i δ_l} - 1 ] P_l(cosθ) )

Ah, right, the formula I remember is f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) * sum over l of (2l+1) [e^{i δ_l} - 1] P_l(cosθ) )

Wait, that's correct. So each term is (2l+1) * [e^{i δ_l} - 1] * P_l(cosθ) multiplied by 1/(2ik).

So for θ=0°, cosθ=1, and P_l(1) = 1 for all l. So f(0) = (1/(2ik)) * sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1) [e^{i δ_l} -1 ]

So, the imaginary part of f(0) is what they're asking for. So first, I need to compute each [e^{i δ_l} -1], take the imaginary part, sum them multiplied by (2l+1), then multiply by 1/(2ik), but wait, let me clarify.

Wait, the imaginary part of f(0) is Im[f(0)] = Im[ (1/(2ik)) * sum (2l+1) (e^{iδ_l} -1) ) ]

But 1/(2ik) can be written as -i/(2k). Because 1/i is -i. So 1/(2ik) = -i/(2k).

So f(0) = sum (2l+1)(e^{iδ_l} -1) * (-i/(2k)).

So when we take the imaginary part of f(0), we have:

Im[f(0)] = Im[ (-i/(2k)) * sum (2l+1)(e^{iδ_l} -1) ]

But the imaginary part of a product where one term is imaginary: Let's think about it.

Let me write each term as:

(2l+1) [ e^{i δ_l} - 1 ] = (2l+1) ( cos δ_l + i sin δ_l -1 )

So each term is (2l+1) [ (cos δ_l -1) + i sin δ_l ]

So the sum is sum [ (2l+1)(cos δ_l -1) ] + i sum [ (2l+1) sin δ_l ]

So when multiplied by (-i/(2k)), each term becomes:

[Real part] * (-i/(2k)) + [Imaginary part] * (-i/(2k))

Let me compute this:

The sum is S = A + i B, where A = sum (2l+1)(cos δ_l -1 ), B = sum (2l+1) sin δ_l.

Then f(0) = [ A + i B ] * [ -i/(2k) ]

Multiply it out:

= [ A*(-i)/(2k) ) ] + [ i B * (-i)/(2k) ]

Simplify each term:

A*(-i)/(2k) → (-i A)/(2k)

i B * (-i) → (-i^2) B = (-(-1)) B = B. So the second term is B/(2k).

So f(0) = [ B/(2k) ) ] + [ (-i A)/(2k) )

So the imaginary part of f(0) is the coefficient of i, which is (-A)/(2k).

Wait, or let me see: f(0) is B/(2k) + [ (-i A) / (2k) ]

So the real part is B/(2k), and the imaginary part is (-A)/(2k).

Wait, but in reality, the imaginary part is the coefficient of i in f(0). So in f(0) = (B/(2k)) - (i A)/(2k), the imaginary part is -A/(2k).

But I think I might have made a mistake in the signs here, because the initial factor is -i/(2k). Let me double-check.

Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to compute Im[f(0)] directly.

Since f(0) is (1/(2ik)) * sum (2l+1)(e^{i δ_l} - 1 )

So f(0) = [ sum (2l+1)(e^{i δ_l} -1 ) ] * (1/(2ik) )

The imaginary part of f(0) is Im [ sum (2l+1)(e^{i δ_l} -1 ) ] * (1/(2k) ) times the real part of 1/(i), because 1/(2ik) = (1/(2k)) * (1/i) = (1/(2k)) (-i).

Wait, maybe a different approach. Let's compute each term's imaginary contribution.

Each e^{i δ_l} is cos δ_l + i sin δ_l. So e^{i δ_l} -1 is (cos δ_l -1) + i sin δ_l.

So (2l+1)(e^{i δ_l} - 1) = (2l+1)(cos δ_l -1) + i (2l+1) sin δ_l.

Summing over l=0 to 4:

Sum = sum( (2l+1)(cos δ_l -1) ) + i sum( (2l+1) sin δ_l )

So the sum is a complex number, real part is sum( (2l+1)(cos δ_l -1) ), imaginary part is sum( (2l+1) sin δ_l ).

Then multiply by 1/(2ik) → which is same as (1/(2k)) (1/i) )= (1/(2k)) (-i).

So multiply each part:

sum_real * (1/(2ik)) → sum_real * (-i)/(2k)

sum_imag * (1/(2ik)) → sum_imag * (-i)/(2k)

But when you multiply sum_imag (which is a real number) by (-i)/(2k), it becomes (-i sum_imag)/(2k).

So the total sum after multiplication is:

[ (-i sum_real )/(2k) ) ] + [ (-i sum_imag )/(2k) ) ]

So this becomes (-i (sum_real + sum_imag i )) / (2k )

Wait, no, because sum_imag is a real number, so when you have (-i sum_imag )/(2k), that's a purely imaginary term.

Wait, perhaps the better approach is to compute the expression.

Let me consider the sum as S = S_real + i S_imag,

Then f(0) = (S_real + i S_imag) * (1/(2ik)) )

But 1/(2ik) = -i/(2k) because 1/i = -i.

So f(0) = (S_real + i S_imag) * ( -i/(2k) )

Multiply out:

S_real * (-i/(2k)) + i S_imag * (-i/(2k))

= [ -i S_real ]/(2k) + [ -i^2 S_imag ]/(2k )

Since i^2 = -1, this becomes:

[ -i S_real ]/(2k) + [ S_imag ]/(2k )

So the real part of f(0) is S_imag/(2k ), and the imaginary part is -S_real/(2k).

So Im[f(0)] = (- S_real )/(2k )

But wait, S_real is sum( (2l+1)(cos δ_l -1 ) ), so Im[f(0)] = - [ sum( (2l+1)(cos δ_l -1 ) ) ] / (2k )

Wait, but wait, that can't be right because the phase shifts are in degrees, and the formula should incorporate them correctly. Let me proceed step by step.

So first, let's compute S_real and S_imag.

But before that, let's note that the phase shifts are given in degrees, but in the formula, angles are in radians since e^{iθ} uses θ in radians. So I need to convert each δ_l from degrees to radians.

So each δ_l is given as:

δ₀ =90°, δ₁=67°, δ₂=55°, δ₃=30°, δ₄=13°.

So let's compute each in radians.

I can use the conversion: degrees * (π/180) = radians.

Compute each:

δ₀: 90 * π/180 = π/2 ≈ 1.5708 radians.

δ₁:67 * π/180 ≈1.16937 radians.

δ₂:55 * π/180 ≈0.95993 radians.

δ₃:30 * π/180= π/6 ≈0.523599 radians.

δ₄:13 * π/180 ≈0.226893 radians.

Now, for each l (0 to 4), compute (2l+1) and the terms (cos δ_l -1 ) and sin δ_l.

Let's create a table for each l:

l | 2l+1 | δ_l (deg) | δ_l (rad) | cos δ_l | sin δ_l | (cos δ -1) | (2l+1)(cos δ -1) | (2l+1) sin δ_l
---|-----|---------|---------|-------|-------|---------|-------------|-------------
0 | 1 | 90 | 1.5708 | 0 | 1 | -1 | 1*(-1)= -1 | 1*(1)=1
1 | 3 | 67 |1.16937 | cos(67)≈0.3907 | sin(67)≈0.9205 | 0.3907-1= -0.6093 | 3*(-0.6093)= -1.8279 | 3*0.9205=2.7615
2 |5 |55|0.95993 | cos(55)=0.5736 | sin(55)=0.8192 | 0.5736-1= -0.4264 |5*(-0.4264)= -2.132 |5*0.8192≈4.096
3 |7 |30|0.523599 | cos(30)=√3/2≈0.8660 | sin(30)=0.5 | 0.8660-1= -0.1340 |7*(-0.1340)= -0.938 |7*0.5=3.5
4 |9 |13|0.226893 | cos(13)=≈0.9744 | sin(13)=≈0.2249 |0.9744-1= -0.0256 |9*(-0.0256)= -0.2304 |9*0.2249≈2.0241

Wait, let me compute the cos and sin correctly.

Wait, for δ₀=90°, cos(90) is 0, sin(90)=1.

For l=0:

(2l+1)=1.

(cos δ - 1) = 0-1= -1.

(2l+1)(cosδ -1) =1*(-1)=-1.

(2l+1) sin δ =1*1=1.

For l=1 (δ=67°):

cos(67) is approximately 0.3907.

sin(67)=approx 0.9205.

(2l+1)=3.

So (3)*(0.3907 -1)=3*(-0.6093)= -1.8279.

3 * 0.9205 ≈2.7615.

l=2: δ=55°

cos(55)≈0.5736.

sin(55)≈0.8192.

(2l+1)=5.

5*(0.5736-1)=5*(-0.4264)= -2.132.

5 * 0.8192≈4.096.

l=3: δ=30°

cos(30)=√3/2≈0.8660.

sin(30)=0.5.

(2l+1)=7.

7*(0.8660-1)=7*(-0.1340)= -0.938.

7*0.5=3.5.

l=4: δ=13°

cos(13)≈0.9744.

sin(13)≈0.2249.

(2l+1)=9.

9*(0.9744-1)=9*(-0.0256)= -0.2304.

9*0.2249 ≈2.0241.

Now, let's sum the real parts and the imaginary parts.

Sum_real = sum of (2l+1)(cosδ -1) for l=0 to4.

So:

l=0: -1

l=1:-1.8279

l=2: -2.132

l=3: -0.938

l=4: -0.2304

Summing all:

-1 -1.8279 = -2.8279

-2.8279 -2.132 = -4.9599

-4.9599 -0.938 = -5.8979

-5.8979 -0.2304 ≈-6.1283.

So S_real ≈ -6.1283.

Sum_imag = sum of (2l+1) sin δ for each l.

l=0:1

l=1:2.7615

l=2:4.096

l=3:3.5

l=4:2.0241

Sum them:

1 +2.7615=3.7615

+4.096 →7.8575

+3.5→11.3575

+2.0241→13.3816.

So S_imag≈13.3816.

Now, Im[f(0)] = (-S_real )/(2k )

Wait, no, earlier conclusion was Im[f(0)] = (-S_real )/(2k ).

Wait, no, earlier, I thought Im[f(0)] is (-S_real)/(2k )

Wait, let me recap.

From earlier steps: f(0) = [ B/(2k) ) ] + [ (-i A)/(2k) ), where A is S_real (sum_real), and B is S_imag.

So the imaginary part of f(0) is the coefficient of i, which is (-A)/(2k )

So Im[f(0)] = (-A)/(2k ), but A is S_real, which is sum_real = sum of (2l+1)(cosδ -1) .

Wait, but in our calculation, S_real is negative, so A is sum_real = -6.1283.

So (-A) is +6.1283.

So Im[f(0)] = (6.1283)/(2k )

Wait, no, because Im[f(0)] = (-S_real)/(2k )

Because S_real is sum_real = sum (2l+1)(cosδ -1 ) = -6.1283.

So Im[f(0)] = (- (-6.1283)) / (2k ) = 6.1283/(2k )

But wait, this would mean Im[f(0)] is positive.

Wait, let me make sure.

Earlier, I think I had Im[f(0)] = (- S_real )/(2k )

But S_real is sum_real = sum (2l+1)(cosδ -1 )

Which is -6.1283.

So (-S_real )=6.1283.

So Im[f(0)] = 6.1283/(2k )

Wait, but wait, the formula for f(0) was:

f(0) = (1/(2ik)) * sum [ (2l+1)(e^{i δ_l} -1) ]

Which when expanded, gives:

sum_real + i sum_imag, multiplied by 1/(2ik )

Which leads to the imaginary part of f(0) being (sum_real)/(2k )

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier analysis. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute the imaginary part directly.

The term [e^{i δ_l} -1 ] can be written as:

e^{i δ_l} = cos δ_l + i sin δ_l,

so [e^{i δ_l} -1 ] = (cos δ_l -1 ) + i sin δ_l.

Each such term for each l contributes to the real and imaginary parts.

The sum over l of (2l+1) [e^{i δ_l} -1 ] is sum_real + i sum_imag.

So when you multiply by 1/(2ik ), you get (sum_real + i sum_imag) * 1/(2ik )

Which can be written as (sum_real)/(2ik ) + (i sum_imag )/(2ik )

Simplify each term:

sum_real/(2ik ) = sum_real/(2k ) * 1/i = sum_real/(2k ) * (-i )

(i sum_imag )/(2ik ) = sum_imag/(2k )

So f(0) = [ (-i sum_real )/(2k ) ] + [ sum_imag/(2k ) ]

So the real part of f(0) is sum_imag/(2k ).

The imaginary part is [ (- sum_real )/(2k ) ] multiplied by i.

So Im[f(0)] = (- sum_real )/(2k )

Wait, that's it. So Im[f(0)] = (sum_real )/(-2k )

But sum_real is negative, so Im[f(0)] would be positive.

Wait, but let me check.

Wait, sum_real is sum (2l+1)(cos δ_l -1 ) = -6.1283.

So Im[f(0)] = (- sum_real )/(2k ) = (6.1283)/(2k )

Wait, but k is the wave number, which is given by 2π/(λ), where λ is the wavelength.

But wait, the electrons are 50 MeV. So I need to compute the wavelength λ of the electrons.

Wait, the electrons are moving at high energy, so relativistic effects are important. The de Broglie wavelength λ is given by h / p, where p is the momentum.

The energy E is 50 MeV, and it's an electron. So the mass of the electron is m_e = 0.511 MeV/c².

Wait, but 50 MeV is much larger than m_e c², so the electron is ultra-relativistic, and E ≈ pc.

So p ≈ E/c.

So λ = h/(p) = (h c)/(E )

But I need to compute this in units where c is in fm/s, h in J s, and E in J.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute using natural units.

Wait, let's compute the momentum p of the electrons.

The energy E is given as 50 MeV.

E = γ m c².

But for high-energy electrons, γ is approximately E/(m c² ), since m c² is 0.511 MeV.

So γ ≈ 50 / 0.511 ≈97.83.

So the momentum p = γ m v.

And since E = γ m c², and for ultra-relativistic, E ≈ pc → p ≈ E/c.

So p ≈ 50 MeV/c.

So the wavelength λ = h/(p) = (h c )/(E )

But h is Planck's constant, 6.626e-34 J s.

c is speed of light, 3e8 m/s.

E is 50 MeV =50e6 eV.

But 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J.

So E =50e6 *1.602e-19 J = 8.01e-13 J.

So λ = (6.626e-34 J s *3e8 m/s ) / (8.01e-13 J )

Compute numerator:6.626e-34 *3e8 =1.9878e-25.

Divide by denominator 8.01e-13: 1.9878e-25 /8.01e-13 ≈ 2.48e-13 meters.

Convert meters to femtometers (1 fm=1e-15 m):

2.48e-13 m = 2.48e2 fm = 248 fm.

Wait, but let me double-check that calculation.

Wait, 6.626e-34 *3e8 = (6.626 *3 )e-34+8 = 19.878e-26 =1.9878e-25.

Divide by 8.01e-13:

1.9878e-25 / 8.01e-13 = (1.9878 /8.01 )e(-25+13) )= approx 0.2481e-12 = 2.481e-13 meters.

Which is 2.481e-13 m = 248.1e-15 m =248.1 fm.

So λ≈248 fm.

So the wave number k is 2π/λ.

k = 2π / (248.1e-15 m )= 2π/(248.1e-15 ) m^-1.

Compute 2π is about 6.2832.

So 6.2832 / 248.1e-15 ≈ 2.534e15 m^-1.

But let me compute exact value.

248.1 fm =248.1e-15 m.

k =2π/(248.1e-15 ) = (2π) / (248.1e-15 ) m^{-1}.

Compute 2π ≈6.28319.

6.28319 /248.1e-15 ≈ approx 2.534e15 m^{-1}.

Now, Im[f(0)] = (sum_real )/ ( -2k )

Wait, earlier, I thought Im[f(0)] is (- sum_real )/(2k ), but sum_real is negative, so (- sum_real ) is positive.

Wait, sum_real is -6.1283.

So Im[f(0)] = (- sum_real )/(2k )= 6.1283/(2k )

But wait, k is 2.534e15 m^{-1}.

So compute 6.1283/(2 *2.534e15 )

6.1283/(5.068e15 ) ≈1.209e-15 m.

Wait, but the options are in fm, which is 1e-15 m.

So 1.209e-15 m is 1.209 fm.

Wait, but that's not matching any of the options. The options are in the hundreds of fm. Wait, did I make a mistake in the calculation?

Wait, wait, perhaps I messed up the computation of the wavelength. Let me recheck.

Wait, the energy is 50 MeV for electrons. Since electrons are relativistic, E ≈ pc.

So p ≈ E/c.

E =50 MeV.

p = 50 MeV / c.

But in units where c=1 (as in MeV units), p =50 MeV/c.

But how to compute the wavelength λ?

λ = h/(p) = h c / (E )

Because p = E/c → λ = h c / E.

h is Planck's constant, 6.62607015e-34 J s.

c is 3e8 m/s.

E is 50 MeV. 1 MeV =1.60218e-13 J.

So E=50e6 *1.60218e-13 J =50e6 *1.60218e-13 =8.0109e-7 J.

So λ = (6.62607015e-34 J s )*(3e8 m/s ) / (8.0109e-7 J )

Compute numerator:6.626e-34 *3e8 =1.9878e-25 J m.

Divided by denominator 8.0109e-7 J: 1.9878e-25 /8.0109e-7 ≈2.48e-19 m.

Wait, no, wait, that can't be right. Because 1.9878e-25 /8.0109e-7 = (1.9878 /8.0109 )e( -25 +7 )= approx 0.248e-18 m =2.48e-19 m.

Wait, which is 0.248e-18 m = 0.248e-18 m = 2.48e-19 m.

That's 2.48e-19 m = 2.48e-4 fm, since 1 fm =1e-15 m.

Wait, that's way too small. That can't be right. I must have made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let's compute λ again.

λ = h c / E.

h =6.626e-34 J s.

c=3e8 m/s.

E=50 MeV =50e6 eV.

1 eV =1.602e-19 J → E=50e6 *1.602e-19 =8.01e-13 J.

So:

λ = (6.626e-34 J s) * (3e8 m/s ) / (8.01e-13 J ) 

= (6.626e-34 *3e8 ) /8.01e-13 m

= (1.9878e-25 ) / (8.01e-13 )

= (1.9878 /8.01 )e( -25 +13 )

= approx 0.248e-12 m = 2.48e-13 m.

Which is 2.48e-13 m = 248 fm.

Ah, that's the same as before. So λ=248 fm.

So k=2π/λ = 2π/(248 fm ) = (6.2832 )/(248 fm ) ≈0.02533 fm^{-1}.

Wait, but wait, let me compute 2π/(248 fm )=?

2π≈6.2832.

6.2832 /248 ≈0.02533.

So k≈0.02533 fm^{-1}.

Wait, that's 0.02533 per fm.

Wait, so 1/k is approx 39.48 fm.

Because 1/(0.02533 ) ≈39.48.

Wait, but in the formula, Im[f(0)] = (6.1283 )/(2k )

So 6.1283 / (2 *0.02533 ) =6.1283/(0.05066 ) ≈120.9 fm.

Wait, that's about 120.9 fm.

But looking at the options, none is near 120. The options are 87k, 355, 177, 251.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of sum_real. Let me check that again.

Wait, let me recompute sum_real and sum_imag.

sum_real is sum (2l+1)(cos δ_l -1 )

l=0: 1*(0-1)= -1.

l=1:3*(cos67 -1 )=3*(0.3907 -1 )=3*(-0.6093 )= -1.8279.

l=2:5*(0.5736-1 )=5*(-0.4264 )= -2.132.

l=3:7*(0.8660-1 )=7*(-0.134 )= -0.938.

l=4:9*(0.9744-1 )=9*(-0.0256 )= -0.2304.

Adding them all:

-1 -1.8279 =-2.8279.

-2.8279 -2.132= -4.9599.

-4.9599 -0.938= -5.8979.

-5.8979 -0.2304= -6.1283.

So sum_real is indeed -6.1283.

So Im[f(0)] = (- sum_real )/(2k )=6.1283/(2k )

With k≈0.02533 fm^{-1}.

So 6.1283/(2 *0.02533 )=6.1283/(0.05066 )≈120.9 fm.

But the options don't include this. Hmm, that's a problem.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps I should have used only up to l=4, but perhaps the sum should include all l's up to a maximum l, but in this case, the data only gives up to δ4, so l=4 is the maximum.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the formula uses the sum over l=0 to L, where L is the maximum l present. So in this case, l runs from 0 to 4.

Another possibility: Did I make a miscalculation in the sum?

Wait, let's double-check the sum_real calculation.

l=0: (2*0+1)=1 →1*(cos90 -1 )=1*(0-1)=-1.

l=1:3*(cos67-1 )=3*(0.3907-1 )=3*(-0.6093)= -1.8279.

l=2:5*(0.5736 -1 )=5*(-0.4264 )= -2.132.

l=3:7*(0.8660 -1 )=7*(-0.134 )= -0.938.

l=4:9*(0.9744 -1 )=9*(-0.0256 )= -0.2304.

Sum is as before: -6.1283.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the formula for the imaginary part. Let me check the steps again.

Earlier, the formula for Im[f(0)] is (sum_real )/( -2k ), but sum_real is negative.

Wait, wait, earlier I thought:

Im[f(0)] = (- sum_real )/(2k )

But sum_real is negative, so (- sum_real ) is positive.

So Im[f(0)] = (6.1283)/(2k )=6.1283/(2 *0.02533 )

Which is 6.1283/(0.05066 )≈120.9 fm.

But the options don't include this.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k.

Let me compute k again.

λ=248 fm.

k=2π/λ → 2π/248 fm ≈ (6.2832 )/(248 )=0.02533 fm⁻¹.

So 1/fm = 1e15 m⁻¹.

Wait, no, 1 fm is 1e-15 m, so 1 fm⁻¹ is 1e15 m⁻¹.

But when I compute k in fm⁻¹, it's 0.02533 fm⁻¹.

So 1/k is 1/0.02533 ≈39.48 fm.

So 6.1283/(2k )=6.1283/(2*(0.02533 ))=6.1283/(0.05066 )=approx 120.9 fm.

But the options don't have an answer near that. The closest is option C)177.675 fm, option D)251.271 fm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula for the imaginary part.

Wait, perhaps I should have used the sum of (2l+1) sin δ_l.

Wait, in the formula, the imaginary part is sum (2l+1) sin δ_l, which is S_imag.

Wait, earlier I thought Im[f(0)] = (- sum_real )/(2k ), but perhaps that's not correct.

Wait, let me think again.

The expression for f(0) is (sum_real + i sum_imag ) * (1/(2ik) )

So f(0)= [ sum_real/(2ik ) ] + [ sum_imag/(2k ) ]

So the real part is sum_imag/(2k )

The imaginary part is sum_real/(2k ) * (1/i ) → which is -i sum_real/(2k ), so the coefficient of i is sum_real/(2k ) * (-1 )

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake here.

Wait, 1/(2ik )= -i/(2k )

So when I multiply sum_real + i sum_imag by ( -i/(2k ) ), I get:

sum_real * (-i/(2k )) + sum_imag * (-i^2/(2k )) 

But i squared is -1, so -i^2 is 1.

So this becomes:

(-i sum_real )/(2k ) + (sum_imag *1 )/(2k )

So the real part is sum_imag/(2k )

The imaginary part is (-sum_real )/(2k )

So Im[f(0)] = (- sum_real )/(2k )

But sum_real is -6.1283, so (- sum_real )=6.1283.

So Im[f(0)] =6.1283/(2k )=6.1283/(2*0.02533 )=6.1283/(0.05066 )=approx 120.9 fm.

But that's not among the options.

Wait, perhaps the phase shifts are given in degrees but the formula uses them in radians, which I did.

Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of the wavelength.

Wait, let me compute the wavelength again more accurately.

E=50 MeV.

E =50e6 eV.

Each eV=1.602e-19 J.

E=50e6 *1.602e-19 J=8.01e-13 J.

h=6.626e-34 J s.

c=3e8 m/s.

λ= h c/E = (6.626e-34 *3e8 )/(8.01e-13 )

Compute numerator:6.626e-34 *3e8=1.9878e-25 J m.

Denominator:8.01e-13 J.

So λ=1.9878e-25 /8.01e-13 = approx 2.481e-13 meters.

Which is 248.1e-15 m=248.1 fm.

So k=2π/λ= 2π/(248.1e-15 m) = 2π/(248.1e-15 ) m⁻¹.

Compute 2π/(248.1e-15 ) = 6.2832 / (248.1e-15 ) ≈2.534e15 m⁻¹.

But 1 fm⁻¹=1e15 m⁻¹, so k=2.534e15 m⁻¹=2.534 fm⁻¹.

Wait, wait, wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Because 248 fm is 248e-15 meters.

So k=2π/(248e-15 ) m^{-1}.

2π is 6.2832.

6.2832/248e-15 = (6.2832/248 ) *1e15 = approx 0.02533 *1e15 =2.533e13 m⁻¹.

Wait, wait, no. Because 248e-15 m is 2.48e-13 m.

So 2π/(2.48e-13 m )=approx 2.533e13 m⁻¹.

Convert to fm⁻¹.

1 fm⁻¹=1e15 m⁻¹.

So 2.533e13 m⁻¹=0.02533 fm⁻¹.

Ah, okay, that's correct as before. So k≈0.02533 fm⁻¹.

So Im[f(0)] =6.1283/(2 *0.02533 )=approx 120.9 fm.

But options don't have that. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the formula for the imaginary part is sum_imag/(k ), not sum_imag/(2k )

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Let me go back to the formula.

The scattering amplitude f(θ) is (1/(2ik )) * sum ( (2l+1)[ e^{iδ_l } -1 ] P_l )

At θ=0, P_l=1.

So f(0) = (1/(2ik )) * sum ( (2l+1)(e^{iδ_l } -1 ) )

Im(f(0)) is the imaginary part of this.

So, let me write f(0) as:

f(0) = (1/(2ik )) * ( sum_real + i sum_imag )

= [ sum_real/(2ik ) ] + [ sum_imag/(2k ) ]

So, to find the imaginary part, I need to compute the imaginary part of [ sum_real/(2ik ) + sum_imag/(2k ) ]

The first term: sum_real/(2ik ) = (sum_real/(2k )) * (1/i ) = (sum_real/(2k )) (-i )

So the imaginary part of this term is (sum_real/(2k )) * (-1 ), because 1/i is -i.

The second term: sum_imag/(2k ) is purely real, so its imaginary part is zero.

So overall, the imaginary part of f(0) is [ sum_real/(2k ) ) * (-1 ) ]

But sum_real is negative, so:

Im(f(0)) = (- sum_real )/(2k )

Which is the same as before.

So Im(f(0))= (6.1283 )/(2 *0.02533 )= approx 120.9 fm.

But this isn't among the options.

Wait, perhaps I have a mistake in the formula for f(0).

Wait, perhaps the correct formula includes the sum of (2l+1) times (e^{i δ_l } ), not (e^{i δ_l } -1 )

Wait, no, the correct formula is f(θ) = (1/(2ik )) sum ( (2l+1) [ e^{i δ_l } -1 ] P_l )

Ah, no, wait, let me double-check.

In the Born approximation and partial wave expansion, the scattering amplitude is given by:

f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) * Σ (2l +1) [ e^{2i δ_l } -1 ] P_l (cosθ )

Wait, no, more accurately, it's [ e^{i δ_l } -1 ] if δ_l is the phase shift. So the formula I used earlier is correct.

Hmm, I'm stuck because according to my calculations, the answer isn't among the options. Perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the sum_real.

Wait, let me recheck the sum_real again, perhaps I made a mistake in the cos δ_l values.

Wait, for δ=67°, cos(67°)= approximately 0.3907. That's correct.

δ=55°, cos(55)=0.5736. Correct.

δ=30°, cos(30)=√3/2≈0.8660. Correct.

δ=13°, cos(13)≈0.9744. Correct.

So sum_real is correct.

Wait, perhaps the formula uses 180/π in a different way. Alternatively, perhaps the phase shifts are in radians already, but used as degrees in the formula.

Wait, no, the phase shifts were given in degrees, so I converted them to radians correctly.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the formula for Im[f(0)] is (sum_imag )/(k )

Because when I have f(0)= [sum_real/(2ik ) ] + [ sum_imag/(2k ) ]

The imaginary part is sum_real/(2k ) * (-1 )

But perhaps the formula is different.

Alternatively, perhaps I have missed a factor of 2 somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the formula is f(θ) = sum ( (2l+1)/(2ik) ) [ e^{i δ_l } -1 ] P_l (cosθ )

No, that's not correct. It's 1/(2ik) multiplied by the sum.

Wait, perhaps the formula uses 1/k, not 1/(2ik ), but that would change things.

Wait, let me think again. The expression for the scattering amplitude is:

f(θ) = (1/(2ik )) sum [ (2l+1) ( e^{i δ_l } -1 ) P_l (cosθ) ]

At θ=0, P_l=1.

So f(0) = (1/(2ik )) sum [ (2l+1) ( e^{i δ_l } -1 ) ]

Which is (1/(2ik )) ( sum_real + i sum_imag )

= [ sum_real/(2ik ) ] + [ sum_imag/(2k ) ]

Which can be written as:

[ (sum_real/(2k )) * (1/i ) ] + [ sum_imag/(2k ) ]

But 1/i = -i.

So:

= [ sum_real/(2k ) * (-i) ] + [ sum_imag/(2k ) ]

So the real part is sum_imag/(2k ), the imaginary part is [ - sum_real/(2k ) ]

Which is same as before.

So Im(f(0)) = sum_real/(2k ) * (-1 )

But sum_real is negative, so Im(f(0))= (6.1283 )/(2k )

Which is 6.1283/(2 *0.02533 )=approx 120.9 fm.

But the options don't have this value. So perhaps I made a mistake in the way I calculated k.

Wait, wait, let's compute k in terms of wavelength.

k=2π/λ.

λ=248 fm.

So k=2π/(248 fm )= (6.2832 )/(248 ) fm^{-1}.

But 6.2832 /248= approx 0.02533 fm^{-1}.

So 1/k=1/(0.02533 )=39.48 fm.

So 6.1283/(2k )=6.1283/(2 *0.02533 )=6.1283/(0.05066 )=120.9 fm.

Hmm, perhaps the formula for the scattering amplitude is different.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the formula for the scattering amplitude uses (2l+1) times the phase shift δ_l in degrees, not converted to radians.

Wait, but that would be incorrect because when using trigonometric functions, the angles should be in radians.

But let me try that approach.

If I compute [e^{i δ_l } -1 ] with δ_l in degrees.

For example, e^{i 90°} is i, so [e^{i90} -1 ]=i-1.

Then, for each l, compute (2l+1)*(e^{i δ_l } -1 ), then sum.

But I think this would complicate things, but let me see.

Wait, if I don't convert the phase shifts to radians, and use them in degrees in the exponential, then e^{i δ_l } would be e^{i δ_l degrees }, which is incorrect, because the exponential function expects the angle in radians.

But perhaps the formula in the question assumes that the phase shifts are in radians. But given that the phase shifts are 90°, which is π/2 radians, using them as 90 would give e^{i 90} = e^{i π/2 }=i, which is correct.

Wait, but if I treat the phase shifts as radians, which they are not, then the sum would be different.

Alternatively, perhaps the phase shifts were given in radians, but the question states they are in degrees. So I think I did the correct thing by converting to radians.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of sum_real.

Let me recompute sum_real:

l=0: (2l+1)=1, cos(90)=0 → 1*(0-1)= -1.

l=1:3 cos(67) =3 *0.3907=1.1721 → 1.1721-3= -1.8279.

l=2:5 *cos(55)=5 *0.5736=2.868 → 2.868 -5= -2.132.

l=3:7 *cos(30)=7 *0.8660=6.062 →6.062 -7= -0.938.

l=4:9 *cos(13)=9 *0.9744=8.7696 →8.7696 -9= -0.2304.

Sum: -1 -1.8279= -2.8279; -2.8279-2.132=-4.9599; -4.9599-0.938=-5.8979; -5.8979-0.2304=-6.1283.

So sum_real is correct.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the formula uses (sum (2l+1) sin δ_l )/(k )

Because 6.1283/(2k )=120.9 fm.

But if it's sum_imag/(k ), which is 13.3816/(0.02533 )= approx 528.4 fm.

Which isn't an option either.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the phase shift signs.

Wait, in the formula for f(θ), the phase shifts are δ_l, but sometimes in some treatments, the phase shifts can be negative, but in this case, all given δ_l are positive.

Alternatively, perhaps I forgot to account for the fact that the phase shifts could be negative, but in this problem, they're given as positive.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for the scattering amplitude includes a factor of (2l+1), but perhaps I missed a factor of 2 somewhere.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the formula is f(θ)= sum ( (2l+1) [ e^{i δ_l } -1 ] P_l (cosθ) ) / (2ik )

Which is the same as what I used earlier.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the question asks for the absolute value of the imaginary part, but that wouldn't change the value.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I can look for an alternative approach.

Wait, perhaps the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude is related to the differential cross-section.

The differential cross-section is given by |f(θ)|².

But in this problem, they're asking for the imaginary part of f(0) along the incident beam, which is θ=0°.

Alternatively, perhaps the imaginary part is related to the optical theorem, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for the imaginary part is sum (2l+1) sin δ_l.

Which in this case is 13.3816.

But what units would that be in? Not sure.

Wait, the options are in units of fm, so perhaps the correct approach is to compute sum (2l+1) sin δ_l, and then multiply by a factor to get the imaginary part in fm.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is Im[f(0)] = (sum (2l+1) sin δ_l ) * (k )^{-1}.

So let's compute sum_imag =13.3816.

Im[f(0)] = sum_imag/(k ) =13.3816/(0.02533 )= approx 528 fm.

But that's not an option either.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is Im[f(0)] = sum_imag/(2k )

Which would be 13.3816/(2 *0.02533 )=13.3816/0.05066≈264 fm.

Which is close to option D) 251.271 fm.

But not exact. Perhaps my approximation is off.

Wait, let me compute more accurately.

sum_imag=13.3816.

k=0.02533 fm⁻¹.

13.3816 / (2 *0.02533 )=13.3816/(0.05066 )=264.13 fm.

Hmm, but option D is 251.271 fm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of sum_imag.

Let me recompute sum_imag.

sum_imag is sum (2l+1) sin δ_l.

l=0:1 *sin90=1*1=1.

l=1:3*sin67=3*(0.9205)=2.7615.

l=2:5*sin55=5*(0.8192)=4.096.

l=3:7*sin30=7*(0.5)=3.5.

l=4:9*sin13=9*(0.2249)=2.0241.

Sum:1 +2.7615=3.7615.

+4.096 →7.8575.

+3.5 →11.3575.

+2.0241 →13.3816.

So sum_imag=13.3816.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula for Im[f(0)] is sum_imag/(k )

Which is 13.3816/(0.02533 )=528.4 fm.

Which is not an option.

Wait, perhaps I should have used k in units of inverse femtometers, which would make Im[f(0)] in fm.

Wait, but I think I did that correctly.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the sum_imag and multiply by (1/k ), but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k.

Wait, let me compute k again.

λ=248 fm.

k=2π/λ= (6.2832 )/(248 )=0.02533 fm⁻¹.

So 1/k=39.48 fm.

So (sum_imag )*(1/k )=13.3816 * 39.48 ≈528.4 fm.

No, that's not matching any option.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the formula uses the sum of (2l+1) sin δ_l multiplied by (1/k ), leading to Im[f(0)] = sum_imag/(k )

Which would be 13.3816/(0.02533 )=528.4 fm.

But options don't have this.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have included all phase shifts up to l=4, but perhaps the problem says to ignore the rest, which I did.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the wavelength.

Wait, let's compute the wavelength again.

E=50 MeV.

electron mass m=0.511 MeV/c².

So E=50 MeV.

In natural units (ħ=c=1), the momentum p=E.

But to convert to physical units, p=E/c.

But perhaps the correct formula for the de Broglie wavelength is λ= h/(p )= h c/(E )

Wait, but E is in MeV, and h c is in MeV fm.

Wait, yes, because 1 fm=1e-15 m.

So h c is approximately 197.33 MeV fm.

So λ= (197.33 MeV fm ) / E (MeV ) → λ=197.33 /50 ≈3.9466 fm.

Wait, wait a minute! This is a much more straightforward approach.

Because h c is approximately 197.33 MeV fm.

So, λ= (h c )/E = (197.33 MeV fm ) / (50 MeV )=3.9466 fm.

Then, k=2π/λ=2π/(3.9466 fm )≈1.599 fm⁻¹.

Ah, this is a much simpler way to compute k.

Wait, this makes more sense. Because 197 MeV fm is a standard value for h c.

So, in this case, λ=197.33 /50 =3.9466 fm.

So k=2π/λ=2π/(3.9466 )≈1.599 fm⁻¹.

So Im[f(0)] = (sum_real )/( -2k )

sum_real =-6.1283.

So Im[f(0)] = (6.1283 )/(2 *1.599 )=6.1283/(3.198 )≈1.914 fm.

Hmm, but that's still not matching any options.

Wait, but wait, perhaps the formula is Im[f(0)] = (sum_real )/(2k )

Wait, no, earlier I thought it was (sum_real )/(-2k )

But sum_real is negative, so (- sum_real )=6.1283.

So Im[f(0)]=6.1283/(2*1.599 )=6.1283/3.198 ≈1.914 fm.

Still not matching.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the sign. Let me recheck.

Wait, no, the formula gives Im[f(0)] = (- sum_real )/(2k )

sum_real is -6.1283 → (- sum_real )=6.1283.

k=1.599 fm⁻¹.

6.1283/(2*1.599 )=6.1283/(3.198 )≈1.914 fm.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula uses sum_imag/(k ).

sum_imag=13.3816.

13.3816/(1.599 ) ≈8.36 fm.

Not matching the options.

Wait, but the options are in the hundreds of fm.

Hmm. Another approach: perhaps the formula is Im[f(0) ]= sum_imag * (k )

Which would be 13.3816 *1.599 ≈21.45 fm.

Still not matching options.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing a factor somewhere.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I made a mistake in the formula and the correct expression is sum_imag/(k ), but without the 1/2 factor.

sum_imag=13.3816.

k=1.599 fm⁻¹.

13.3816/(1.599 )=8.36 fm.

Still not matching options.

Wait, perhaps the formula is Im[f(0) ]= sum_imag/(2k )

Which would be 13.3816/(2*1.599 )=13.3816/3.198≈4.18 fm.

Still not matching.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to use the formula:

Im[f(0) ]= (2l+1) sum sin δ_l / (2k )

Wait, but that's not correct as per the Born approximation.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should recompute using the correct k.

If I use the correct k=1.599 fm^{-1}, and compute Im[f(0)] = (sum_real )/( -2k )

sum_real =-6.1283.

So Im[f(0)]= (6.1283 )/(2 *1.599 )=6.1283/(3.198 )=1.914 fm.

No, that's way off.

Wait, perhaps I've made a mistake in the approach. Maybe the correct formula involves the sum of (2l+1) sin δ_l multiplied by something else.

Another approach: perhaps the imaginary part of f(0) is (sum (2l+1) sin δ_l ) * (1/k )

Which would be 13.3816 /1.599≈8.36 fm.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C) 177.675 fm.

Which is approximately (197 MeV fm )/(50 MeV ) * something.

Wait, perhaps the formula I should have used is:

Im[f(0)] = (sum (2l+1) sin δ_l ) * (197 MeV fm ) / E (MeV )

So sum_imag=13.3816.

E=50 MeV.

So (13.3816 *197 ) /50 = (2641.0772 )/50=52.8215 fm.

But this isn't matching any option.

Alternatively, perhaps it's (sum (2l+1) sin δ_l ) * (197 MeV fm ) / (2 E )

Which would be 13.3816 *197 / (2*50 ) =13.3816 *197 /100.

13.3816 *1.97≈26.35 fm.

Still not matching.

Hmm.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the correct formula for the scattering amplitude is:

f(θ)= sum ( (2l+1)/(2ik) ) [ e^{i δ_l } -1 ] P_l (cosθ )

So for θ=0, f(0)= sum ( (2l+1)/(2ik) ) [ e^{i δ_l } -1 ]

Which can be written as sum ( (2l+1) [ e^{i δ_l } -1 ] ) / (2ik )

The imaginary part would then be [ sum ( (2l+1) (cos δ_l -1 ) ) ] / (2k )

Which is sum_real/(2k )

sum_real =-6.1283.

k=1.599 fm⁻¹.

So Im[f(0)]= (-6.1283 )/(2 *1.599 )= (-6.1283 )/(3.198 )= -1.914 fm.

But since the question asks for the imaginary part's magnitude, perhaps it's 1.914 fm, which is not among the options.

Hmm.

I'm stuck. Perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula for the imaginary part is sum ( (2l+1) sin δ_l ) * (k )^{-1}.

So Im[f(0)] = sum_imag/(k )

sum_imag=13.3816.

k=1.599 fm⁻¹.

13.3816 /1.599 ≈8.36 fm.

Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to use the sum of (2l+1) sin δ_l multiplied by (h c )/(2 E )

Hmm.

Wait, (h c )=197.33 MeV fm.

So sum_imag * (h c )/(2 E )

sum_imag=13.3816.

E=50 MeV.

So 13.3816 *197.33/(2*50 )=13.3816 *197.33/(100 )

=13.3816 *1.9733≈26.35 fm.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is sum_imag * (h c )/(E )

Which would be 13.3816 *197.33/50=13.3816 *3.9466≈52.8 fm.

Still not matching.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should check the options' possible values.

Option C is 177.675 fm.

Which is approximately 197.33 MeV fm * (sum_imag )/(E )

sum_imag=13.3816.

13.3816 *197.33 =2641.38 MeV fm.

Divided by E=50 MeV: 2641.38/50=52.827 fm.

Not matching.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

Im[f(0) ]= (sum_imag ) * (h c )/(2 E )

Which would be 13.3816 *197.33/(2*50 )=13.3816*197.33/(100 )= approx 26.35 fm.

Still not matching.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is:

Im[f(0) ]= (sum_imag ) * (h c )/( E )

Which would be 13.3816 *197.33/50= approx 52.83 fm.

No match.

Hmm.

At this point, I think I must have made a mistake in the approach, but I'm not seeing where. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C)177.675 fm.

Wait, let me try:

If Im[f(0) ]= (sum_imag ) * (h c )/( E ), which is 13.3816 *197.33/50=52.83 fm.

Hmm, not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute sum_real and then multiply by (h c )/(2 E )

sum_real= -6.1283.

-6.1283 *197.33 MeV fm/(50 MeV )= -6.1283 *3.9466≈-24.22 fm.

Hmm, no.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is:

Im[f(0) ]= sum_imag * (h c )/(2 E )

Which is 13.3816 *197.33/(2*50 )=13.3816 *1.9733≈26.35 fm.

No.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is Im[f(0)] = (sum_imag ) * (k )^{-1}.

Which would be 13.3816 / 1.599≈8.36 fm.

No.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the correct formula for Im[f(0)].

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is Im[f(0) ]= (sum (2l+1) sin δ_l ) * (h c )/(2 E )

Which would be 13.3816 *197.33/(2*50 )=13.3816 *1.9733≈26.35 fm.

No.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I've made a mistake in using the formula for the imaginary part. Another approach: perhaps the imaginary part of f is related to the total cross-section via the optical theorem.

The optical theorem says:

σ_total = (4π/k² ) Im[f(0) ]

So Im[f(0) ]= (k² σ_total )/(4π )

But without σ_total, I can't use this.

Hmm.

Another thought: perhaps the problem is using the nuclear charge parameter and other factors, but I don't have that information.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is 177.675 fm, which is option C.

But I'm not seeing the exact steps to get there.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k. Let me check again.

Using h c=197.33 MeV fm.

E=50 MeV.

So λ= h c /E =197.33/50=3.9466 fm.

k=2π/λ=2π/(3.9466 )=1.599 fm⁻¹.

Now, sum_imag=13.3816.

Im[f(0) ]= sum_imag/(k )=13.3816/1.599≈8.36 fm.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is Im[f(0) ]= sum_imag * (h c )/(E )

Which would be 13.3816 *197.33/50=52.83 fm.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula uses sum_imag multiplied by (h c )/(2 E )

Which would be 13.3816 *197.33/(2*50 )=26.35 fm.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is Im[f(0) ]= sum_imag * (h c )/( E ) * (1/(2k )) )

Which would be 13.3816 *197.33/(50 ) * (1/(2 *1.599 ))= (2641.38/50 ) * (1/3.198 )=52.827 *0.3127≈16.5 fm.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the scattering amplitude as:

f(θ)= sum ( (2l+1) e^{i δ_l } P_l )

And then take the imaginary part.

But I'm not sure.

At this point, I'm stuck and time is limited, so perhaps I should make an educated guess. The closest option to my initial calculation of 120.9 fm isn't present, but option C is 177.675 fm, which is approximately 197 MeV fm * (sum_real )/(something )

But I can't see a clear path, so perhaps the correct answer is option C)177.675 fm, but I'm not certain.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves calculating the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude, \( \text{Im}[f(0)] \), for elastic scattering of 50 MeV electrons from a nuclear target. The phase shifts \(\delta_0 = 90^\circ\), \(\delta_1 = 67^\circ\), \(\delta_2 = 55^\circ\), \(\delta_3 = 30^\circ\), and \(\delta_4 = 13^\circ\) are provided, and the rest are ignored. The scattering amplitude is expressed as:

\[
f(0) = \frac{1}{2ik} \sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1) \left(e^{i\delta_l} - 1\right),
\]

where \(k\) is the wave number, given by \(k = \frac{2\pi}{\lambda}\), and \(\lambda\) is the de Broglie wavelength of the electrons. The imaginary part of \(f(0)\) is derived as:

\[
\text{Im}[f(0)] = \frac{-\sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1)(\cos\delta_l - 1)}{2k}.
\]

### Key Steps:
1. **Phase Shifts in Radians**: Convert the phase shifts from degrees to radians:
   \[
   \delta_0 = \frac{\pi}{2}, \quad \delta_1 \approx 1.169, \quad \delta_2 \approx 0.9599, \quad \delta_3 \approx 0.5236, \quad \delta_4 \approx 0.2269.
   \]

2. **Sum Real and Imaginary Parts**:
   - For each \(l\), compute \((2l+1)(\cos\delta_l - 1)\) for the real part and \((2l+1)\sin\delta_l\) for the imaginary part.
   - Summing these gives:
     \[
     \text{Sum}_{\text{real}} = -6.1283, \quad \text{Sum}_{\text{imag}} = 13.3816.
     \]

3. **Wave Number \(k\)**: Using the de Broglie wavelength formula \(\lambda = \frac{h c}{E}\), where \(h c \approx 197.33 \, \text{MeV fm}\) and \(E = 50 \, \text{MeV}\), calculate:
   \[
   \lambda = \frac{197.33}{50} \approx 3.9466 \, \text{fm}, \quad k = \frac{2\pi}{\lambda} \approx 1.599 \, \text{fm}^{-1}.
   \]

4. **Imaginary Part of \(f(0)\)**:
   Using \(\text{Im}[f(0)] = \frac{-\text{Sum}_{\text{real}}}{2k}\), substitute \(\text{Sum}_{\text{real}} = -6.1283\) and \(k \approx 1.599 \, \text{fm}^{-1}\):
   \[
   \text{Im}[f(0)] = \frac{-(-6.1283)}{2 \times 1.599} \approx \frac{6.1283}{3.198} \approx 1.914 \, \text{fm}.
   \]

5. **Mismatch with Options**: The calculated value of \(1.914 \, \text{fm}\) does not match any of the provided options. Reassessing the formula or approach is necessary, but the closest plausible answer based on the options and calculations is **C) 177.675 fm**.

### Conclusion:
The imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction is best approximated by **C) 177.675 fm**, though the exact derivation of this value remains unclear due to discrepancies in the calculations.
