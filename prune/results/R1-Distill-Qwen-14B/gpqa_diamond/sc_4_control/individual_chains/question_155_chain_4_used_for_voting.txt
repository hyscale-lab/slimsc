Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to find the uncertainty in the P_z operator, ΔP_z. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think through it step by step.

Alright, the problem says that the system is in an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ. The state is given as a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). So, the state is |ψ> = [ -1/2; √2/2; -1/2 ]? Wait, no, the second element is 1/sqrt(2), which is approximately 0.707, right. So yeah, the vector is (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2).

Wait, but the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z. So, the state is expressed in the P_z basis. That's important because when we calculate expectation values, we can use this representation.

I remember that the uncertainty in an operator Q is given by the square root of <Q²> minus [<Q>]². So for P_z, that would be sqrt( <P_z²> - <P_z>^2 ). So I need to compute both the expectation value of P_z and the expectation value of P_z squared.

Since P_z is a diagonal matrix (as given), its expectation value is straightforward. Let me write down the matrix for P_z. The matrix is:

[ ħ  0   0 ]
[ 0  0   0 ]
[ 0  0 -ħ ]

Wait, no. The problem states that the matrix form of P_z has first row (ħ, 0, 0), second (0,0,0), and third (0,0,-ħ). So yes, it's diagonal with entries ħ, 0, -ħ.

So, in the basis of P_z, the components of the state are [a, b, c] where a = -1/2, b=1/sqrt(2), c=-1/2.

Wait, but wait: When the state is written as a column vector in the eigenbasis of P_z, each component corresponds to the eigenvalue. So, the state is a linear combination of the eigenvectors of P_z. Therefore, the expectation value of P_z is the sum of the probabilities of each eigenstate multiplied by their eigenvalues.

So, the expectation value <P_z> is the sum over i of |ψ_i|^2 * (eigenvalue of P_z for state i).

Looking at the state vector, which is the column vector [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ].

Each component here is ψ_1 = -1/2, ψ_2 = 1/√2, ψ_3 = -1/2.

Wait, but the state is a normalized vector, right? Let me check: |ψ_1|^2 + |ψ_2|^2 + |ψ_3|^2 = (1/4) + (1/2) + (1/4) = (1/4 + 1/4) is 1/2, plus 1/2 makes 1. So yes, it's normalized.

So, each |ψ_i|^2 is the probability of being in that eigenstate. The eigenvalues of P_z for each basis vector are ħ for the first, 0 for the second, and -ħ for the third.

So, <P_z> = |ψ_1|^2 * ħ + |ψ_2|^2 * 0 + |ψ_3|^2 * (-ħ) = (1/4) * ħ + 0 + (1/4)*(-ħ). So that's (1/4 - 1/4) ħ = 0. So <P_z> is zero.

Now, I need to compute <P_z²>. But since P_z is diagonal, P_z squared is the same as the square of each diagonal element. So P_z squared will have entries (ħ², 0, ħ²) on the diagonal.

So, the expectation value <P_z²> is |ψ_1|^2 * (ħ²) + |ψ_2|^2 * (0)^2 + |ψ_3|^2 * (ħ²) = (1/4) * ħ² + 0 + (1/4)* ħ² = (1/2) ħ².

So <P_z²> is (1/2) ħ². And <P_z> is zero, as we found earlier.

Therefore, the uncertainty ΔP_z is sqrt( <P_z²> - <P_z>² ) = sqrt( (1/2 ħ²) - 0 ) = sqrt(1/2) ħ = ħ / sqrt(2).

Wait a minute, but let me double-check. Because sometimes, especially with operators, the expectation value of P_z could involve more steps, but in this case, since the state is in the eigenbasis of P_z, the expectation value is straightforward as each component is an eigenstate.

Another way to think about it: since the state is expressed in the P_z basis, the expectation value is just the sum of the probabilities multiplied by their respective eigenvalues. Which is what we did.

So the uncertainty is sqrt( (ħ^2/2) ) = ħ / sqrt(2).

Looking at the options, option B is ħ/sqrt(2), which matches.

To determine the uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ of the operator $P_z$, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

### Step 1: Expectation value of $P_z$ ($\langle P_z \rangle$)
The system is in the eigenstate of $P_x$ with eigenvalue $-\hbar$, and the state is given as the column vector:

\[
|\psi\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{1}{2} \\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ -\frac{1}{2} \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of $P_z$, and the eigenvalues of $P_z$ are $\hbar$, $0$, and $-\hbar$ for the first, second, and third basis vectors, respectively. The expectation value of $P_z$ is:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \sum_{i=1}^3 |\psi_i|^2 \cdot \text{(eigenvalue of $P_z$ for basis $i$)}.
\]

The probabilities $|\psi_i|^2$ are:
- $|\psi_1|^2 = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}$,
- $|\psi_2|^2 = \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{2}$,
- $|\psi_3|^2 = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}$.

Substituting these into the formula:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 0 + \frac{1}{4} \cdot (-\hbar) = 0.
\]

### Step 2: Expectation value of $P_z^2$ ($\langle P_z^2 \rangle$)
The operator $P_z^2$ is diagonal with entries $(\hbar^2, 0, \hbar^2)$ on the diagonal. The expectation value of $P_z^2$ is:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \sum_{i=1}^3 |\psi_i|^2 \cdot \text{(eigenvalue of $P_z^2$ for basis $i$)}.
\]

The eigenvalues of $P_z^2$ are $\hbar^2$, $0$, and $\hbar^2$ for the first, second, and third basis vectors, respectively. Substituting the probabilities:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar^2 + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 0 + \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar^2 = \frac{1}{2} \hbar^2.
\]

### Step 3: Uncertainty $\Delta P_z$
Using the formula for uncertainty:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2} \hbar^2 - 0} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}} \hbar = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

### Final Answer
The uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ is $\frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}$, which corresponds to option **B**.
