Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a decay process. Let me see what I can do. Hmm, the question is about a pion at rest decaying into a muon and a neutrino. The reaction is Pi(+) → mu(+) + nu. The pion is stationary, and I need to find the kinetic energies of the products. The options are A, B, C, D with different MeV values.

Wait, I remember that when a particle at rest decays, the total energy and momentum are conserved. Since the pion is at rest, its initial momentum is zero. After decay, the total momentum of the products must also be zero. So the muon and neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta.

Oh right, because momentum is conserved. So the magnitude of the muon's momentum (p) must be equal to that of the neutrino's (p'), but their directions are opposite. That makes sense.

So, the energies of each particle can be found using their relativistic energy-momentum relation. The total energy of a particle is sqrt(p²c² + m²c⁴). But wait, since we're dealing in MeV and the masses are given in MeV/c², maybe I can work in units where c=1 to simplify calculations. So energy E = sqrt(p² + m²).

The pion is at rest, so its total energy is just its rest mass energy, which is 139.6 MeV. The muon has a rest mass of 105.7 MeV, and the neutrino's rest mass is negligible (like zero, I think, because neutrinos are super light). So the neutrino's energy is just its kinetic energy plus its rest mass (which is almost zero), so E_nu = p_nu * c, but again, with c=1, E_nu ≈ p.

Wait, but wait: the pion's rest energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and neutrino. So E_pi = E_mu + E_nu. Which is 139.6 MeV.

And because of momentum conservation, p_mu = p_nu. Let's denote p as the magnitude of the muon's momentum, then the neutrino's momentum is also p but in the opposite direction. So their momenta are equal in magnitude.

So, for the muon: E_mu = sqrt(p² + m_mu²) = sqrt(p² + (105.7)^2) [since m_mu is 105.7 MeV/c², with c=1, m_mu is 105.7 MeV].

For the neutrino: E_nu = p (since m_nu is ~0), so E_nu = p.

So the total energy is E_mu + E_nu = sqrt(p² + 105.7²) + p = 139.6.

Hmm, plugging in, I can write the equation:

sqrt(p² + (105.7)^2) + p = 139.6

Let me set x = p for simplicity.

So sqrt(x² + 105.7²) + x = 139.6

Let me subtract x from both sides:

sqrt(x² + 105.7²) = 139.6 - x

Now, square both sides:

x² + (105.7)^2 = (139.6 - x)^2

Expanding the right side: (139.6)^2 - 2*139.6 x + x²

So:

x² + (105.7)^2 = (139.6)^2 - 2*139.6 x + x²

Subtract x² from both sides:

(105.7)^2 = (139.6)^2 - 2*139.6 x

Now, compute the squares.

Compute (105.7)^2: 105.7 * 105.7. Let me calculate that. 100*100=10,000. 5.7^2=32.49. Cross term is 2*100*5.7 = 1140. So (100+5.7)^2 = 10000 + 1140 + 32.49 = 11172.49. So 105.7^2 ≈ 11172.49 (MeV)^2.

139.6^2: let's compute 140^2 is 19600. But 139.6 is 140 -0.4. So (140 -0.4)^2 = 140^2 - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4^2 = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19488.16. So approximately 19488.16.

So substituting back:

11172.49 = 19488.16 - 2*139.6 x

So, rearranging:

2 * 139.6 x = 19488.16 - 11172.49

Compute 19488.16 - 11172.49:

19488.16 - 11172.49 = 8315.67

So now:

2*139.6 x = 8315.67

Compute 2*139.6: 279.2

So x = 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ let's compute that.

Divide 8315.67 by 279.2:

279.2 * 29 = let's see: 279 * 30 = 8370, which is a bit more than 8315. So 29 * 279.2 is 29 * 200=5800, 29*79=2300 + 29*0.2=5.8 → 5800+2300=8100, 8100+5.8=8105.8. Wait, 279.2 * 29 = 279.2 * 20 + 279.2 * 9 = 5584 + 2512.8 = 8096.8. So 29 gives us 8096.8. The difference is 8315.67 -8096.8 = 218.87.

Now, 279.2 * 0.78 ≈ 218.736 (since 0.7 * 279.2=195.44, 0.08 * 279.2=22.336, sum 217.776). Hmm, 0.78 gives 217.776. So 279.2 * (29.78) ≈ 29.78 *279.2 ≈ 8315.67.

So x ≈ 29.78 ≈ 29.78 MeV/c.

Wait, but wait, x is p, the momentum in MeV/c. So p ≈ 29.78 MeV/c.

So the neutrino's energy is E_nu = p ≈ 29.78 MeV. Since neutrino's rest mass is negligible, its kinetic energy is approximately the same as its total energy. So KE_nu ≈ 29.78 MeV.

Wait, but wait: the muon's energy is E_mu = sqrt(p² + m_mu²) = sqrt( (29.78)^2 + (105.7)^2 )

Let me compute that. 29.78^2 = approx (30)^2=900, but 29.78 is just under 30. 29.78^2 = (30 - 0.22)^2 = 900 - 2*30*0.22 + 0.22^2 = 900 - 13.2 + 0.0484 ≈ 886.8484.

So 29.78^2 ≈ 886.85.

105.7^2 is 11172.49.

So sqrt(886.85 + 11172.49) = sqrt(12059.34) ≈ sqrt(12059.34). Well, sqrt(12100) is 110, so sqrt(12059.34) is about 109.81.

Wait, let me calculate more precisely. 109.81^2 = (109 + 0.81)^2 = 109^2 + 2*109*0.81 + 0.81^2. 109^2 is 11881. 2*109*0.81= 218*0.81=176.58. 0.81^2=0.6561. So 11881 + 176.58 = 12057.58 + 0.6561=12058.2361. Hmm, the actual value is 12059.34. So 109.81^2 = 12058.2361, which is a bit less than 12059.34. So the next decimal: let me see, 109.81 + 0.01=109.82. 109.82^2 = (109.81 +0.01)^2 = (109.81)^2 + 2*109.81 *0.01 +0.01^2 = 12058.2361 + 2.1962 + 0.0001 = 12060.4324. Hmm, that's over 12059.34. So between 109.81 and 109.82.

Let me find x where x^2=12059.34.

We know that 109.81^2 = 12058.2361

The difference is 12059.34 -12058.2361=1.1039.

The derivative of x^2 is 2x. At x=109.81, derivative is 219.62.

So delta_x ≈ 1.1039 / 219.62 ≈ approx 0.005.

So x ≈ 109.81 + 0.005 = 109.815.

So E_mu ≈ 109.815 MeV.

So the kinetic energy of the muon is E_mu - m_mu = 109.815 - 105.7 = approximately 4.115 MeV.

Wait, that's about 4.12 MeV. And the neutrino's KE is about 29.78 MeV. Looking at the options, option D is 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV. So that's matching.

Wait, but let me double-check the numbers. Because sometimes when solving equations, approximations can lead to minor errors.

Wait, when I solved for x, I got x≈29.78 MeV/c. So the neutrino's energy is 29.78 MeV, which is its KE since its rest mass is negligible. The muon's KE is about 4.12 MeV. So the option D is 4.12 and 29.8 MeV.

But wait, another thought: the pion is at rest, so the decay products must have equal and opposite momenta. The muon's momentum is p, and the neutrino's is p as well, but in opposite direction. So their energies are E_mu = sqrt(p² + m_mu²), and E_nu = p.

So the total energy is E_pi = E_mu + E_nu = 139.6.

Wait, let me recheck the calculation of the momentum p.

The equation was sqrt(p² + 105.7²) + p = 139.6.

Let me plug p=29.78 into this equation and see if it holds.

Compute sqrt(29.78^2 + 105.7^2) + 29.78.

29.78^2 is approx 886.85, as before. 105.7^2 is 11172.49.

So sqrt(886.85 + 11172.49)=sqrt(12059.34)=~109.815.

Adding 29.78: 109.815 +29.78=139.595 MeV. That's about 139.595, which is very close to 139.6. So that's correct.

So the neutrino's KE is 29.78 MeV, and the muon's KE is 4.12 MeV. So option D is 4.12 and 29.8, which matches approximately.

Wait, but let me look at the options again.

Option D: 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV.

Yes, that's the correct one.

To solve the problem, we analyze the decay process of a stationary pion, **π⁺ → μ⁺ + ν**, using conservation of energy and momentum. The rest mass of the pion is 139.6 MeV, and the rest mass of the muon is 105.7 MeV. The neutrino's rest mass is negligible.

### Key Equations:
1. **Energy conservation**:  
   The total energy of the pion is distributed between the muon and the neutrino:  
   \[
   E_{\pi} = E_{\mu} + E_{\nu}
   \]  
   Since the pion is stationary, its total energy is its rest energy:  
   \[
   E_{\pi} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]

2. **Momentum conservation**:  
   The pion has zero initial momentum. After the decay, the muon and neutrino have equal and opposite momenta:  
   \[
   p_{\mu} = p_{\nu}.
   \]

3. **Relativistic energy-momentum relation**:  
   For the muon:  
   \[
   E_{\mu} = \sqrt{p_{\mu}^2 + m_{\mu}^2},
   \]  
   where \(m_{\mu} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV}\).  
   For the neutrino (negligible rest mass):  
   \[
   E_{\nu} = p_{\nu} = p_{\mu}.
   \]

### Solving for Momentum \(p_{\mu}\):
Using energy conservation:  
\[
E_{\pi} = \sqrt{p_{\mu}^2 + m_{\mu}^2} + p_{\mu}.
\]  
Substitute \(E_{\pi} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}\):  
\[
139.6 = \sqrt{p_{\mu}^2 + 105.7^2} + p_{\mu}.
\]  
Let \(x = p_{\mu}\). Rearranging:  
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + 105.7^2} = 139.6 - x.
\]  
Square both sides:  
\[
x^2 + 105.7^2 = (139.6)^2 - 2(139.6)x + x^2.
\]  
Cancel \(x^2\):  
\[
105.7^2 = 139.6^2 - 2(139.6)x.
\]  
Compute \(105.7^2 = 11172.49\) and \(139.6^2 = 19488.16\):  
\[
11172.49 = 19488.16 - 2(139.6)x.
\]  
Rearrange:  
\[
2(139.6)x = 19488.16 - 11172.49.
\]  
\[
2(139.6)x = 8315.67.
\]  
\[
x = \frac{8315.67}{279.2} \approx 29.78 \, \text{MeV/c}.
\]

### Calculating Energies:
1. **Neutrino's energy**:  
   Since \(E_{\nu} = p_{\nu} = x\):  
   \[
   E_{\nu} \approx 29.78 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]  
   The neutrino's kinetic energy is approximately equal to its total energy:  
   \[
   KE_{\nu} \approx 29.78 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]

2. **Muon's energy**:  
   Using \(E_{\mu} = \sqrt{x^2 + m_{\mu}^2}\):  
   \[
   E_{\mu} = \sqrt{29.78^2 + 105.7^2}.
   \]  
   Compute \(29.78^2 \approx 886.85\) and \(105.7^2 = 11172.49\):  
   \[
   E_{\mu} = \sqrt{886.85 + 11172.49} = \sqrt{12059.34} \approx 109.815 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]  
   The muon's kinetic energy is:  
   \[
   KE_{\mu} = E_{\mu} - m_{\mu} = 109.815 - 105.7 \approx 4.12 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]

### Final Answer:
The kinetic energies of the muon and neutrino are approximately **4.12 MeV** and **29.8 MeV**, respectively. This matches **Option D**.

Answer: D
