Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. The problem says it's a 0.02 M solution of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. And the stability constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10. Hmm, I remember that EDTA forms complexes with metal ions, and the stability constant tells us how strong that complex is.

Wait, what's the stoichiometry here? I think EDTA typically complexes with Ca²+ in a 1:1 ratio. So the formula would be something like [CaEDTA]^2- or similar. So when they say the solution is 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex, that means the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M.

Now, the question is about the concentration of free calcium ions in solution. Because the complex dissociates a little bit, right? So the complex [CaEDTA]^n- dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA^4- or something like that.

The stability constant, K, is given by K = [Ca²+][EDTA^4-] / [CaEDTA^2-]. Wait, no, maybe the formula is K = [Ca²+][EDTA^4-] / [CaEDTA^2-], but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact charges here. Let me think: EDTA^4- is the form that binds Ca²+. The complex is [CaEDTA]^2- because calcium is +2 and EDTA is -4, so combined it's -2.

So the dissociation equation is [CaEDTA]^2- ↔ Ca²+ + EDTA^4-.

The stability constant K would be [Ca²+][EDTA^4-] / [CaEDTA^2-]. Since K is given as 5e10, which is a very large number, that means the complex is very stable, so the dissociation doesn't happen much. So the concentrations of free Ca²+ and EDTA^4- would be very low compared to the complex concentration.

Wait, but in the solution, the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. So if we let x be the concentration of [Ca²+] produced, then [EDTA^4-] is also x, assuming that each complex releases one Ca²+ and one EDTA^4-.

So at equilibrium, [Ca²+] = x, [EDTA^4-] = x, and [CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 - x.

But since K is so large (5e10), x will be very small compared to 0.02. So we can approximate [CaEDTA^2-] ≈ 0.02.

So plugging into the K expression:

K = (x)(x) / 0.02 ≈ x² / 0.02 = 5e10.

So x² = 5e10 * 0.02 = 1e9.

Wait, 5e10 multiplied by 0.02 is 1e9? Let me calculate: 5e10 * 0.02 = 5e10 * 2e-2 = (5 * 2) * 1e8 = 10e8 = 1e9. Yes.

So x squared is 1e9. Taking the square root, x is sqrt(1e9) = 3.16e4? Wait, wait no. Wait, sqrt(1e9) is 3.16e4? Wait, no. Wait, 1e9 is 10^9. The square root is 10^(9/2) = 10^4.5 = 3.16e4. Wait, but that can't be right because 3.16e4 is larger than the initial concentration of 0.02 M. That can't be possible. Because if x is 3.16e4, which is 31600 M, but our initial concentration is only 0.02 M. That doesn't make sense. So I must have made a mistake in my calculations.

Wait, wait, let me recheck. K is 5e10, so K = x² / 0.02 =5e10. So x² = 5e10 * 0.02 = 1e9. Square root of 1e9 is 3.16e4? Wait no, sqrt(1e9) is 31622.7766... which is about 3.16e4. But that's way bigger than 0.02 M. So that can't be. So our approximation that x is small compared to 0.02 is invalid. Hmm, that complicates things.

Wait, that can't be right. Because K is so large, the complex should be almost completely dissociated? No, wait, no. Wait, actually, no. A large K means the reaction favors the products. So the complex is very stable, meaning very little dissociation. So x should be very small. So why is my calculation giving a large x? Did I make a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the problem is with the way I set up the equation. Maybe the correct K expression is K = ([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]) / ([CaEDTA^2-]).

But if the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, and we assume x is negligible compared to 0.02, then [CaEDTA^2-] ≈ 0.02.

So K ≈ (x^2) / 0.02 =5e10.

x^2 =5e10 * 0.02 = (5 * 0.02)*1e10 = 0.1e10 = 1e9.

x= sqrt(1e9)=3.16e4 M. That's impossible because that's way larger than 0.02 M. So maybe I messed up the K expression.

Wait, perhaps the K is given as the formation constant, Kf, which is [complex]/([metal][ligand]). So the formation constant Kf = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]) =5e10.

So the expression would be [CaEDTA^2-] = Kf * [Ca²+][EDTA^4-].

At equilibrium, [CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

So 0.02 ≈ Kf * x^2.

So x^2 = 0.02 / Kf.

Wait, Kf is 5e10, so 0.02 /5e10 = 4e-13.

x= sqrt(4e-13)=2e-6.5=2e-6.5 is same as sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait wait, 4e-13 is 4 *1e-13, square root is 2 * 1e-6.5. 1e-6.5 is 3.16e-7. So 2 *3.16e-7 is about 6.32e-7.

Wait, so x is about 6.32e-7 M. Looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M. So the correct answer should be option C.

Wait, why did I initially get confused? Because I thought K was the dissociation constant, but I think it's actually the formation constant. So the correct setup is Kf = [complex]/([Ca][EDTA]) =5e10.

So, [Ca] = x = sqrt( ( [complex] ) / Kf )

Wait, no, in this case, [complex] = Kf * [Ca][EDTA].

Assuming [Ca] = [EDTA] =x, and [complex] is 0.02.

So 0.02 = Kf * x^2.

So x² = 0.02 / Kf = 0.02 /5e10 = 4e-13.

x= sqrt(4e-13)=2e-6.5= approx 6.3e-7.

So the concentration of calcium ions is 6.3e-7 M, which is option C.

To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a 0.02 M solution of the Ca-EDTA complex, we use the stability constant \( K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = 5 \times 10^{10} \). The dissociation of the complex can be represented as:

\[
[\text{CaEDTA}]^{2-} \leftrightarrow \text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{4-}
\]

Let the concentration of free \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\) and \(\text{EDTA}^{4-}\) at equilibrium both be \(x\). The equilibrium expression for the stability constant is:

\[
K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = \frac{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}{[\text{CaEDTA}]^{2-}}
\]

Substituting \( [\text{Ca}^{2+}] = x \), \( [\text{EDTA}^{4-}] = x \), and \( [\text{CaEDTA}]^{2-} \approx 0.02 \) (since \(x\) is expected to be very small compared to 0.02 M), we get:

\[
K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = \frac{x^2}{0.02}
\]

Rearranging for \(x^2\):

\[
x^2 = \frac{K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} \cdot 0.02}{1} = \frac{5 \times 10^{10} \cdot 0.02}{1} = 1 \times 10^9
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{1 \times 10^9} = 3.16 \times 10^4
\]

This result is inconsistent because \(x = 3.16 \times 10^4 \, \text{M}\) is much larger than the initial concentration of the complex (0.02 M). This indicates an error in the interpretation of \(K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}}\). Instead, \(K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}}\) is the formation constant, defined as:

\[
K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = \frac{[\text{CaEDTA}]^{2-}}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}
\]

Rewriting the equilibrium expression:

\[
[\text{CaEDTA}]^{2-} = K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} \cdot [\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]
\]

Assuming \([\text{Ca}^{2+}] = [\text{EDTA}^{4-}] = x\) and \([\text{CaEDTA}]^{2-} \approx 0.02\), we have:

\[
0.02 = K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} \cdot x^2
\]

Substituting \(K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = 5 \times 10^{10}\):

\[
x^2 = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} = 6.3 \times 10^{-7}
\]

Thus, the concentration of free \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\) ions is approximately \(6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}\), which corresponds to option C.
