Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about density matrices. Hmm, I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's mixed. The question is about finding the geometrical position of a particular density matrix in qubit space.

The given density matrix is ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). Wait, let me write that out. So it's a 2x2 matrix because it's for a qubit. Each term is a projector, right? |0⟩⟨0| is the outer product of the basis vector |0⟩ with itself, same for |1⟩⟨1|. So the matrix ρ would look like this:

(1/2)*[ [1, 0], [0, 1] ] because |0⟩⟨0| is diagonal with 1s in the first position and zero elsewhere, and same for |1⟩⟨1|, but the second position. Adding them gives a 2x2 identity matrix. Then we multiply by 1/2, so each diagonal element is 1/2.

So ρ is a diagonal matrix with both diagonal elements equal to 1/2. That makes sense because it's a completely mixed state. It's the maximally mixed state for a qubit because it can't be distinguished from any other state when you don't have any information about it.

Now, the question is about the geometrical position of this state in qubit space. I think this relates to how density matrices are represented in the Bloch sphere. Oh right, the Bloch sphere is a way to visualize qubit states. Pure states are on the surface, and mixed states are inside. But how does that translate to the density matrix's coordinates?

I recall that any density matrix can be written in terms of the Bloch vector. The Bloch vector r has three components: r_x, r_y, r_z. The density matrix is then (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices and I is the identity matrix. So if I can express ρ in terms of the Pauli matrices, I can find r.

So let's rewrite ρ. Our ρ is (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|) = (I)/2, since I is |0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|. So substituting into the Bloch form, (I + r·σ)/2 = I/2. That implies that r·σ must be zero. So r must be zero because any non-zero r would contribute something.

So the Bloch vector r has components (0,0,0). Therefore, the density matrix is at the origin of the Bloch sphere, which represents the completely mixed state. Looking at the options, option C is (0,0,0). So that's the answer.

Wait, but let me double-check. Another way to think about it: the density matrix ρ is diagonal with equal probabilities for |0⟩ and |1⟩. The Bloch vector's components are determined by the off-diagonal terms and the diagonal terms beyond the first. The off-diagonal terms in ρ are zero, which would mean r_x and r_y are zero. The diagonal terms are both 1/2. The Bloch sphere's z-component is 2*(ρ_00 - 1/2), right? So ρ_00 is 1/2, so 2*(1/2 - 1/2) = 0. So r_z is zero too. Yep, so r is (0,0,0). So option C is correct.

The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This is a 2x2 diagonal matrix with both diagonal elements equal to \( \frac{1}{2} \). This represents a maximally mixed state for a qubit, which cannot be distinguished from any other mixed state without additional information.

To determine the geometrical position of this state in qubit space, we use the Bloch sphere representation. Any density matrix can be expressed in terms of the Bloch vector \( \mathbf{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z) \) as:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} \right),
\]

where \( I \) is the identity matrix and \( \boldsymbol{\sigma} \) represents the Pauli matrices. Comparing this with the given \( \rho \), we see that \( \rho = \frac{1}{2} I \), which implies \( \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} = 0 \). This means \( \mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0) \).

Thus, the density matrix corresponds to the origin of the Bloch sphere, representing the completely mixed state. Among the options provided, the correct answer is:

**C) \( r = (0, 0, 0) \)**.
