Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with all the reactions, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane being heated with excess KOH. I remember that when dibromides react with strong bases like KOH, especially in a dehydrohalogenation reaction, elimination occurs. But wait, this is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, which is a bicyclic structure. Oh right, adamantane has a diamondoid structure, so the bromines are on adjacent carbons in a bridge structure.

So heating with KOH would probably lead to an elimination reaction, forming an alkene. Because two bromides are adjacent, the base would abstract a beta hydrogen, and the Br would leave, forming a double bond between the two carbons. So the product 1 would be 1,3-adamantadiene? Or maybe more accurately, the double bonds would form between the positions where the Brs were. Since it's 1,3-dibromo, elimination would form a 1,3-diene. But wait, adamantane is a fused ring system, so the actual structure might lead to a bridge double bond.

Looking at the NMR data for product 1: 4.79 ppm (2H) as a singlet. Hmm, that's a bit deshielded. Maybe it's a methylene group adjacent to an oxygen, like an ether or something. Wait, wait. KOH is a strong base, but maybe it's an epoxide? No, because epoxidation typically requires peracids, not elimination. Alternatively, could it be a diol? But the IR absorbance is at 1720 cm-1, which is a strong peak, probably a carbonyl. So maybe it's not a diol but an ester or ketone. Oh wait, if elimination didn't happen but instead a substitution, but KOH is more about elimination here.

Wait, let's think again. 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH. Oh, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation to form an alkene, which would give a diene. But the NMR shows a peak at 4.79, which is around where a CH2 group adjacent to an oxygen might appear, like an epoxide. Wait, but if elimination forms a double bond, why would there be an oxygen? Oh wait, perhaps the base caused an elimination to form a bridgehead double bond, and maybe some ring opening? I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, the IR shows 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl. So maybe the product is a ketone. How could that happen? If one of the bromides is replaced by an oxygen group. Oh, but KOH is a base, so maybe it's an elimination to form a carbonyl. Wait, when two adjacent Br atoms are present, elimination could form a carbonyl via a double E2 mechanism. Oh wait, maybe the dehydrohalogenation leads to a ketone. Because when two bromides are on adjacent carbons, eliminating both as Br- and forming a double bond between the two carbons would give a carbonyl. Wait, but wait, that would require each carbon to lose a Br and a H to form a double bond, but that's more like a di-elimination. Alternatively, perhaps one of the Brs leaves, and the other is part of a ring expansion.

Wait, maybe the reaction isn't elimination but a substitution. But with KOH, which is a strong base, elimination is more likely than substitution. So perhaps the product is an epoxide? But to form an epoxide, you'd need an oxide ion or something. Wait, but KOH is a strong base, so maybe in a double elimination, two bromides are removed, and oxygen bridges them. Hmm, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the product is a diol, but that doesn't explain the carbonyl.

Wait, maybe the product is a ketone. How? Suppose each Br is on a bridgehead carbon. When both are eliminated, perhaps a carbonyl forms between the two bridgeheads. So each Br leaves, and each H is abstracted, forming a double bond. But then how does that lead to a ketone?

Wait, another thought: maybe one Br is eliminated, and the other is replaced by an oxygen. But that doesn't make sense directly. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a double elimination leading to a bridgehead double bond, which would be a diene. But the IR doesn't show a peak for a C=C (around 1650 cm-1), so maybe that's not the case.

Wait, the NMR data has a singlet at 4.79 ppm. That's a region for CH2 groups, perhaps adjacent to an electronegative atom like oxygen. Oh, maybe it's an epoxide. But epoxides are typically around 3.5-4.5 ppm. Wait, but if it's a bridgehead epoxide, perhaps the chemical shift is upfield a bit. Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclopropane ring or something else.

Wait, but the IR peak at 1720 is a strong carbonyl. So perhaps the product is an ester or a ketone. Let me think again about the reaction. If 1,3-dibromoadamantane is treated with KOH, maybe it undergoes a double elimination, forming a ketone. Because each Br is on a carbon that's adjacent to another Br. So, each Br leaves, and each carbon takes a double bond, but that would form a conjugated diene, not a ketone.

Wait, perhaps it's a different mechanism. Maybe one Br is eliminated as a base abstracts a hydrogen, forming a carbene or something, but that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe the base abstracts a hydrogen from a neighboring carbon, leading to the formation of an alkoxide, which then eliminates another Br. But that would form a double bond, not a carbonyl.

Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think about the IR again. 1720 cm-1 is a strong peak, so likely a ketone. So perhaps the product is a ketone. If the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, upon treatment with KOH, maybe one of the Brs is replaced by an O- group. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction forms an epoxide, but that doesn't explain the carbonyl.

Wait, maybe the reaction isn't elimination but substitution. But with KOH, elimination is more likely. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction forms a diketone, but that would require two eliminations, which seems unlikely.

Wait, perhaps I should look at the NMR. 4.79 ppm is a singlet for 2H. Maybe it's a methylene group adjacent to an oxygen. But with a singlet, perhaps it's part of an ether or something. Maybe it's a bridgehead CH2 group next to an oxygen. But I'm not getting it.

Wait, another approach: maybe the product is 1,3-adamantanone. How? If the two Brs are on adjacent carbons in a bridge, then elimination of both Brs as HBr would form a double bond, but I'm not sure that would form a ketone. Wait, wait, perhaps the formation of a double bond would require each carbon to lose a Br and a H. So each Br leaves with a proton from adjacent carbons, leading to a double bond. But that would form a diene, not a ketone.

Wait, maybe I'm wrong about the reaction. Let's think: 1,3-dibromoadamantane is treated with KOH in an alcoholic solution. It's a dehydrohalogenation. The product would be a diene. But then why does the NMR show a singlet for 2H at 4.79? Maybe that's the bridgehead CH2 group. Let me imagine the structure of 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Adamantane has four cyclohexane rings fused together. The 1 and 3 positions are on adjacent bridgeheads. So when both Brs are eliminated, it would form a bridgehead double bond. So the product would be an adamantadiene with a double bond between C1 and C3. But would that give a singlet for two CH2 groups?

Wait, if the product is a diene, the NMR might show peaks for the CH2 groups in the diene. But the singlet at 4.79 suggests something else. Maybe the product is an epoxide after all. But how? If the base is KOH, perhaps it's a nucleophilic substitution. But the structure of adamantane is such that bridgehead positions are typically not reactive towards substitution because of the high ring strain. So SN2 is unlikely. So elimination is more likely.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial reaction is a double elimination, forming a ketone. Wait, perhaps each Br is replaced by an O, but that seems odd.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a ring-opening. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought. If the product is a diketone, but that doesn't make sense from the starting material.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where each Br is replaced by an -OH group, giving a diol. But the IR peak at 1720 cm-1 doesn't fit with an -OH (which would show a broad peak around 3200-3600 cm-1). But wait the question says the IR shows a characteristic absorbance at 1720, which is more likely a carbonyl.

So maybe product 1 is a ketone. How? Let's think about the structure.

If 1,3-dibromoadamantane loses two HBr molecules, perhaps via a double elimination, leading to a carbonyl. But how? Each elimination would form a double bond, but perhaps in this structure, the two adjacent carbons each lose Br and H, leading to a conjugated diene. But that wouldn't form a ketone.

Wait, perhaps the reaction forms an epoxide. If the base is KOH, but that usually isn't an oxidizing agent. Alternatively, if the base causes the formation of an epoxide via a different mechanism, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product isn't from elimination but a substitution. But I don't see how substitution would lead to a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the initial reaction is not elimination but a substitution where one Br is replaced by an oxygen group. But I don't know.

Wait, maybe I should consider the structure of product 1. If the IR has a peak at 1720, it's probably a ketone. So product 1 is 1,3-diketo-adamantane or something. But how?

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a diester. But with KOH, that seems unlikely.

Wait, another approach: maybe the reaction is a Birch reduction or something else, but I'm not sure.

Hmm, perhaps I'm stuck on product 1. Let's try to think about the next steps in case I can backtrack.

Product 1 is treated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. Aluminum isopropoxide is a strong Lewis acid, often used in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. But product 1 is a ketone, so perhaps it's undergoing some kind of acylation or alkylation.

Wait, if product 1 has a ketone group, then treatment with Al isopropoxide might induce some kind of enolate formation or maybe help in some kind of alkylation. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe product 1 is an ester, which would react differently.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diol, but then the IR doesn't fit. I'm going in circles here. Maybe I should think about the ozonolysis step.

Product 2 is ozonolyzed at -78°C followed by dimethyl sulfide. Ozonolysis typically breaks double bonds into carbonyl groups. The reaction conditions are important. At low temperatures (-78°C), ozonolysis tends to cleave double bonds into ozonides which, upon workup with a reductive agent like dimethyl sulfide, form aldehydes and ketones.

So if product 2 has a double bond, ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl groups. Then, the NMR of product 3 would show signals from the carbonyl groups and any adjacent protons.

Now, looking at the options for the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen. The most deshielded would likely be adjacent to an electronegative group, like a carbonyl. So maybe these protons are next to a ketone or aldehyde group.

But to get the coupling pattern, we need to know the neighboring protons. For example, if a proton is next to two other protons, it could split into a triplet. If it's next to two sets of protons, perhaps more splitting occurs.

Alternatively, perhaps the most deshielded proton is part of a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl. So, if that CH2 is next to another CH2, the protons would couple with each other. Wait, but in a CH2 group, the two protons are equivalent and would split into a singlet. Hmm, no, wait. Let's imagine a structure: R-CO-CH2-CH2-R. Wait, no, if it's a CH2 adjacent to a carbonyl, and the next carbon has another CH2, then the protons on the CH2 next to the carbonyl would each have two neighboring protons (from the adjacent CH2), leading to a triplet. But wait, each H on the CH2 would be adjacent to two H's on the adjacent CH2, so each would be a triplet. So the splitting would be a triplet.

But wait, product 3's NMR is what we're considering. So the most deshielded hydrogen is adjacent to a carbonyl. Let's think of a scenario where this H is part of a CH2 group next to a carbonyl, and that CH2 is adjacent to another CH2. So each H on the CH2 next to the carbonyl would couple with two H's on the adjacent CH2. Each H would have two neighboring H's, so each would split into a triplet. So the coupling pattern would be a triplet.

Alternatively, if the CH2 is next to a CH group, each H would couple with two H's (from the CH) and another H, leading to a more complex splitting, perhaps a triplet of triplets or something else.

Wait, perhaps the structure is such that the CH2 is adjacent to another CH2, making each H on the first CH2 couple with two H's, leading to a triplet. So the answer would be triplet, which is option A.

Alternatively, maybe the H is part of a CH group adjacent to another CH group. For example, CH2-CO-CH2-CH3. The H on the CH2 adjacent to the CO would be split by the neighboring CH2. Each H on the adjacent CH2 would split into a triplet, but wait, let me think again.

Wait, if the structure is R-CO-CH2-CH2-CH3, then the CH2 next to CO would have two H's each coupling with the two H's on the next CH2. So each H on the first CH2 would have two neighboring H's, leading to a triplet. So the NMR would show a triplet.

But maybe there's another possibility. Suppose the H is part of a CH group that's next to another CH group. For example, R-CO-CH2-CH2-CH2-R. Then the middle CH2 would have neighboring H's from both sides, leading to more splitting. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a six-membered ring with substituents, leading to a coupling pattern that's a triplet of triplets or something else.

Wait, let me think about the possible structures. Product 1 is from 1,3-dibromoadamantane and KOH. If product 1 is a ketone, then product 2 would be the result of a Friedel-Crafts alkylation, but wait, Friedel-Crafts requires an aromatic ring, which adamantane doesn't have. So perhaps product 1 isn't a ketone.

Wait, maybe product 1 is an epoxide. Then, when treated with Al isopropoxide, perhaps it undergoes ring-opening. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diene. Then product 2 would be something else. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I should think about product 2: treated with aluminum isopropoxide. Aluminum isopropoxide is a Lewis acid, often used as a catalyst. It can also be involved in acylations or alkylation. Another thought: if product 1 is a diene, then product 2 could be a diol or something else. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a ketone, and product 2 is an enol ether or something. Hmm. I'm getting stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diol. Then, when treated with Al isopropoxide, maybe it undergoes some kind of elimination to form a diene. Then, ozonolysis would break that diene into carbonyl groups.

Wait, if product 1 is a diol (from substitution of Br with OH groups), then product 2 is formed by Al isopropoxide, which could act as a dehydrating agent, causing the diol to eliminate water and form a double bond. So product 2 would be a diene. Then, ozonolysis of product 2 would cleave the double bonds into carbonyl groups.

So, if product 2 is a diene, ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl groups. So product 3 would have carbonyl groups, and the H's adjacent to them would show up in the NMR.

But let's think about the coupling pattern. Suppose the diene in product 2 is a conjugated diene, and ozonolysis breaks each double bond into carbonyl groups. If the diene was in a symmetrical position, the resulting product would have equivalent groups.

Wait, but the most deshielded H would be on a CH group adjacent to a carbonyl. For example, if the structure is something like (CH2)2CO, but that's just a guess.

Wait, perhaps product 3 is a diketone, with each ketone having adjacent CH2 groups.

Alternatively, maybe the ozonolysis produces two aldehyde groups. Let's say the diene in product 2 is between two CH2 groups. Ozonolysis would break the double bond into two aldehyde groups, so the structure would be O=CH-CH2-CH2-O=CH2. No, that doesn't make sense because ozonolysis of a diene would give two carbonyl groups. Wait, for example, a 1,3-diene would break into two aldehydes if it's a terminal diene.

Wait, perhaps the diene in product 2 is a 1,3-diene. Ozonolysis would break each double bond, but wait, each 1,3-diene has one double bond. So ozonolysis would give two carbonyl groups.

Wait, maybe product 3 has two carbonyl groups, and the most deshielded H is adjacent to one of them. So, let's say the structure is something like CH2(CO)CH2CH2(CO)CH2. Then, the H's on the CH2 adjacent to the CO would each be next to two H's on the adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet.

Alternatively, if the H is on a CH group next to a CO, and that CH is next to another CH group, then the splitting could be more complex.

Wait, but if the structure is (CO)CH2CH2(CO), then the H's on the CH2 next to CO are each adjacent to two H's on the adjacent CH2. So each H would couple with two H's, leading to a triplet. So the coupling pattern would be a triplet.

So the answer would be A) triplet.

Wait, but let me make sure. If the H is on a CH2 group next to a carbonyl, and that CH2 is next to another CH2 group, then each H on the first CH2 has two neighboring H's on the adjacent CH2. So each H would have n+1 = 2+1=3 peaks, i.e., a triplet.

Yes, that makes sense. So the most deshielded H would be a triplet.

The reaction begins with 1,3-dibromoadamantane being heated with excess KOH. This likely leads to a double elimination reaction, where two molecules of HBr are removed. The resulting product, 1, is a ketone, as indicated by the IR spectrum showing a strong absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹, characteristic of a carbonyl group. The NMR data supports this, with a singlet at 4.79 ppm (2H), likely corresponding to a methylene group adjacent to the carbonyl.

Next, product 1 is treated with excess aluminum isopropoxide. Aluminum isopropoxide, a strong Lewis acid, likely facilitates further reaction. Given the structure of product 1 as a ketone, this step may involve enolate formation or another reaction that leads to the formation of a diene, product 2.

Product 2 is then subjected to ozonolysis at -78°C, followed by the addition of dimethyl sulfide. Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds, breaking them into carbonyl groups. If product 2 is a diene, ozonolysis would produce two carbonyl-containing fragments, resulting in product 3.

In the NMR spectrum of product 3, the most deshielded hydrogen is adjacent to a carbonyl group. This hydrogen is part of a CH₂ group next to the carbonyl, and the adjacent CH₂ group contributes two neighboring hydrogens. Each hydrogen on the CH₂ group adjacent to the carbonyl will couple with the two hydrogens on the neighboring CH₂ group, resulting in a triplet coupling pattern.

Thus, the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is a triplet.
