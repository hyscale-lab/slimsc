Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, let me try to think through this.

Alright, the setup is that there are two stars with the same mass as the Sun. Each has a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. Both planets have circular orbits. The RV method measures the Doppler shift of the star's spectral lines due to the planet's gravitational pull.

So, the question is about the orbital periods of the two planets. Planet #1 causes a 5 milliangstrom shift, and Planet #2 causes a 7 milliangstrom shift. We need to find how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1.

Wait, I'm a bit rusty on this. So, the RV method detects the star's wobble. The velocity semi-amplitude (K) is related to the Doppler shift. The formula for K is something like K = ( (G * (M_planet) ) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) ) )^(1/3) ) / ( (P * (1 - e²)^(3/2) ) )^(1/3) ) ) but I might be mixing up terms.

Alternatively, I remember that the RV semi-amplitude depends on the mass of the planet, the star's mass, the orbital period, and the distance of the planet from the star. Wait, since both stars have the same mass and the planets' masses are similar, maybe I can find a relationship between their velocities or periods.

Wait, another approach: the Doppler shift is proportional to the velocity of the star. So, if Planet #1 causes a 5 milliangstrom shift and Planet #2 a 7, then their velocities are proportional to 5 and 7. So, the velocity semi-amplitude K is higher for Planet #2.

Wait, no. Wait, let me think again. The RV method measures the velocity of the star towards and away from us. So, the semi-amplitude K is the maximum velocity of the star. The formula for K is given by:

K = ( ( (G * (M_planet) ) / ( (M_star + M_planet) ) )^(1/3) ) * (1 / (P * sqrt(1 - e²))) ) )^(1/1)

But since the eccentricity e is zero for both (they have circular orbits), e² is zero, so sqrt(1-0) is 1. So K simplifies to:

K = ( ( G * M_p ) / (M_star) )^(1/3) ) / ( P )^(1/3) )

Wait, no, maybe I should get the exact formula. The radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) is given by:

K = ( ( (27 * pi * G) / (8 * c^3) ) )^(1/3) ) * ( (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3) (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3)) ) ) * (1 / (P^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2)) )

But since both planets have circular orbits, e is zero, and sin i is approximately 1 (edge-on, which maximizes K). Also, since M_p is much smaller than M_star (Neptune is much less than the Sun), M_p / M_star is negligible, so 1 + M_p/M_star ≈ 1. So, the denominator is M_star^(2/3). 

So, simplifying K:

K ≈ ( (27 pi G / 8 c^3 )^(1/3) ) * ( M_p ) / ( M_star^(2/3) ) ) * ( 1 / ( P^(1/3) ) )

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck, but another approach is to consider that for the same star mass and planet mass, K is inversely proportional to the cube root of the period P. Because K is inversely proportional to (P)^(1/3). So if K1 and K2 are the velocities for the two planets, and P1 and P2 their periods, then K1/K2 = ( P2 / P1 )^(1/3 )

Wait, because K is proportional to (1/P^(1/3)). So,

K ∝ 1 / P^(1/3)

Which means, K1 / K2 = (P2 / P1)^(1/3)

Wait, no. Let me think again. If K is proportional to 1 / (P^(1/3)), then K1 = (constant) / P1^(1/3), K2 = (constant) / P2^(1/3). So, K1/K2 = (P2 / P1)^(1/3).

Alternatively, solving for P: P1 = ( (constant) / K1 )^3, P2 = ( (constant) / K2 )^3. So, P2 / P1 = ( (constant/K2)^3 ) / ( (constant/K1)^3 ) ) = ( K1^3 ) / ( K2^3 ) ) = (K1/K2)^3.

Wait, that can't be right. Let me think again. Let me write it properly.

Given K = (some constant) / (P)^(1/3), so P = (some constant)/ K³.

So, if K1 and K2 are the velocities for two systems, then P1 = C / K1³, P2 = C / K2³.

So, P2 / P1 = ( C / K2³ ) / ( C / K1³ ) ) = ( K1³ ) / ( K2³ ) ) = ( K1/K2 )³.

So, P2 is (K1/K2)^3 times P1.

Wait, that's the key. Because the periods are inversely proportional to the cube of the velocity semi-amplitude.

So in our case, the K values are 5 and 7 milliangstroms. So, K1 =5, K2=7.

Wait, but wait, which is which? The question says that the shift for Planet #1 is 5, and Planet #2 is 7. So, which has a higher K? Planet #2 has a higher K because 7 is larger than 5. Since K is the velocity amplitude, a larger K means the star is moving faster due to the planet.

So, K2 is larger than K1. So, (K1/K2) = 5/7.

So, the ratio P2/P1 = (K1/K2)^3 = (5/7)^3 = 125 / 343 ≈ 0.364.

Wait, that would mean Planet #2 has a shorter period than Planet #1. But the question is, How many times longer is the period of Planet #2 than Planet #1? Oh wait, no. Wait, the question says "How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?" So, that's P2 / P1.

From the calculation, P2/P1 = (5/7)^3 ≈ 0.364. So, about 0.36 times. So, the period of Planet #2 is 0.36 times that of Planet #1. So, it's shorter, not longer.

But wait, the options are A) ~0.36, B) ~1.40, etc. So, option A is 0.36, which would make P2 = 0.36 * P1, meaning Planet #2's period is 36% of Planet #1's. So, it's shorter. But the question is how many times longer is P2 than P1. So, if P2 is 0.36 * P1, then it's shorter, meaning it's not longer. So, perhaps I got the ratio reversed.

Wait, let me re-examine. Because K is proportional to (1/P^(1/3)), so P is proportional to (1/(K^3)).

So, P2 = (K1^3 / K2^3) * P1.

So, P2 = ( (5)^3 / (7)^3 ) * P1 = (125 / 343) P1 ≈ 0.364 P1.

So, P2 is approximately 0.364 times P1. So, the period of Planet #2 is 36% of that of Planet #1. So, it's shorter, not longer. So the answer would be that Planet #2 is about 0.36 times as long as Planet #1. But the question asks how many times longer is P2 than P1, which would be 0.36 times. So, the ratio is 0.36, meaning P2 is shorter.

Wait, but the options are phrased as P2 being longer than P1. So, perhaps I have the ratio inverted. Let me check again.

Wait, the question is: How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?

So, they want P2 / P1.

From our calculation, P2/P1 = (5/7)^3 ≈ 0.364. So, P2 is 0.36 times as long as P1. So, Planet #2's period is shorter than Planet #1's. So the answer is ~0.36 times as long, which is option A.

But wait, I might have made a mistake in the initial setup. Let me think again about the formula.

The RV semi-amplitude K is given by (from the radial velocity method):

K = (v) = ( ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star) ) )^(1/3) ) * (1/( (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3) )) ) * (1 / (P * (1 - e²)^(1/2)) )^(1/3) )

But since M_p << M_star, (1 + M_p/M_star ) ≈ 1, and e=0, so we can simplify.

So, K ≈ ( ( G * M_p ) / ( M_star ) )^(1/3) ) / ( P^(1/3) )

Wait, but I should get the exact formula. Alternatively, perhaps the correct proportionality is K ∝ (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3) P^(1/3) )

Wait, another source says the formula is:

K = ( ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p) ) )^(1/3) ) * ( 1 / ( P * sqrt(1 - e²) ) ) ) )^(1/3) )

Wait, perhaps I should approach it with Kepler's third law. Because both planets are orbiting stars of the same mass, the period depends on the semi-major axis (assuming same mass, so for circular orbits, same a).

Wait, but how does the RV method relate to the period? The RV method measures the velocity of the star, which relates to the planet's orbital parameters.

Wait, I think the key is that the semi-amplitude K is inversely proportional to the cube root of the period. So, higher K means shorter period.

So, if the shift is larger, the velocity semi-amplitude is larger, which implies a shorter period.

So, Planet #2 has a larger shift (7) than Planet #1 (5), so K2>K1. So, P2 < P1.

So, the ratio P2/P1 is (K1/K2) cubed. So 5/7 cubed is approximately 0.364.

So, the period of Planet #2 is shorter than Planet #1's by about 0.36 times.

Wait, but the question is asking how much longer is Planet #2's period than Planet #1's. So, 0.36 times as long, which is 36% of the other. So, it's shorter, not longer. So the answer would be approximately 0.36 times as long, meaning it's 0.36 times longer, but that's a bit confusing. Wait, no: if P2 is 0.36 * P1, then it's 36% of P1, so it's shorter. So, P2 is 0.36 times P1, meaning it's 0.36 as long, which implies that it's about 64% shorter.

But the question is how many times longer is P2 than P1? So, if P2 is 0.36 of P1, then it's 0.36 times longer, which is the same as being 36% as long as P1. So, the answer is 0.36 times, which is option A.

To determine how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1, we analyze the relationship between the radial velocity semi-amplitude \( K \) and the orbital period \( P \). The radial velocity semi-amplitude is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period:

\[
K \propto \frac{1}{P^{1/3}}
\]

This implies:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{K_1}{K_2}\right)^3
\]

Here, \( K_1 = 5 \, \text{milliangstroms} \) (for Planet #1) and \( K_2 = 7 \, \text{milliangstroms} \) (for Planet #2). Substituting these values:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3 = \frac{125}{343} \approx 0.364
\]

Thus, the orbital period of Planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of Planet #1. This means Planet #2's period is shorter than Planet #1's, not longer. However, the question asks how many times longer Planet #2's period is compared to Planet #1's. Since \( P_2 \) is shorter, the ratio \( P_2/P_1 \) directly answers the question, yielding approximately 0.36.

From the options provided, the correct answer is:

**A) ~0.36**
