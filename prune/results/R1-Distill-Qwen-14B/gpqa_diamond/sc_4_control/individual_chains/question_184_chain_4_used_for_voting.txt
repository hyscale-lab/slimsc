Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these synthesis pathways. Let's try to break it down step by step.

The target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Hmm, let me visualize that structure. So, the benzene ring has three substituents: a tert-butyl group, an ethoxy group, and a nitro group. Their positions are 1, 2, and 3. Wait, numbering starts from one of the substituents, right? Let me think: in benzene, the positions are numbered in a way that gives the substituents the lowest possible numbers. So if the substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3, that would be adjacent. But wait, I might be mixing something up.

Wait, wait. Let me draw this out. So the benzene ring is a hexagon. Let's imagine substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3. So position 1 is ethoxy, 2 is tert-butyl, and 3 is nitro. Alternatively, maybe I should think about their arrangement. But perhaps that's complicating things. Maybe the order of reactions is more important.

The question is about the sequence of reactions starting from benzene to get to this product. So the options are A, B, C, D, each with a different order of reactions.

Let me think about the typical reactions that introduce substituents onto benzene. The main ones are nitration, sulfonation, alkylation (like using AlCl3 as a catalyst), and then things like hydrolysis or elimination.

Looking at the target molecule, I see three substituents: tert-butyl, ethoxy, and nitro. So we need three different reactions that add these groups to the benzene ring.

Wait, but the order in which these groups are added is crucial because each substituent directs the next incoming group. So I need to plan the order to get all three substituents in the right positions.

Let's think about the directing effects. Nitro is a meta-director, ethoxy is an ortho/para director (since it's an electron-donating group via O's lone pairs), and tert-butyl is an alkyl group, which is an ortho/para director as well.

But wait, in the target molecule, the substituents are at positions 1,2,3. Let me try to figure out their arrangement. Let me imagine the benzene ring: suppose the ethoxy is at position 1, nitro at 3, and tert-butyl at 2. So the ethoxy is at position 1, which is adjacent to nitro at 3 (since in a benzene ring, positions 1 and 3 are not adjacent, wait no, that's not right. Wait, maybe I'm getting the positions wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the numbering is such that the substituents are in a meta arrangement, but that's tricky.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the order of adding these groups. Let me think about each substituent's effect on where the next group comes in.

First, let's consider which substituent is added first. Since nitration is often done early, maybe we start with nitration. But wait, but nitration adds a nitro group, which is a meta director. If the next substitution is, say, ethoxy, which is an ortho/para director, the nitro group will influence where the ethoxy goes.

Alternatively, if we first add the ethoxy group, which is activating, then nitration would be directed by ethoxy. Let's think: benzene → ethoxy benzene (using an etherification, perhaps via a tosylate or something with NaOH and EtBr, but that's for substitution. Wait, wait, ethoxylation is typically done via nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but that's tough unless the ring is activated. Oh wait, no, ethoxylation is usually done through a substitution reaction like the ethoxy group being introduced via an SN mechanism, but benzene itself isn't reactive enough. Oh wait, no, benzene can't undergo substitution directly. Oh wait, no, benzene undergoes electrophilic substitution. So to add an ethoxy group, perhaps we need to perform a Williamson ether synthesis or use something like ethyl bromide with a strong base. Wait, no, that's for aliphatic substitution. Alternatively, maybe we're using a Friedel-Crafts alkylation, but that's for alkyl groups, not ethers.

Wait, wait, no. Ethoxy group is an ether, so perhaps it's introduced as an O-alkylation. But benzene isn't nucleophilic enough for that. So maybe we need a directing group. Alternatively, perhaps we introduce a leaving group first, then substitute it with the ethoxy group.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let's think again. To introduce an ethoxy group, an O-alkylation is required. But aromatic O-alkylation is difficult because benzene is not very reactive. So perhaps we can first introduce a nitro group, then a leaving group, and then substitute with ethoxy.

Alternatively, perhaps we use a two-step process: first, introduce a substituent that directs the next group, then introduce the ethoxy.

Alternatively, maybe the ethoxy group is added via a nucleophilic substitution after the ring is activated with a strong electron-withdrawing group. For example, nitrating benzene, then sulfonating to make a good leaving group, then substituting with ethoxy. Wait, that might be a possibility.

So here's a possible plan:

1. Nitration of benzene - introduces a nitro group (meta director).
2. Then, perhaps sulfonation to add a sulfonic acid group, which is a good leaving group. But wait, sulfonic acid is a strong meta director. Alternatively, maybe the next step is to alkylate with tert-butyl chloride using AlCl3 as a catalyst (Friedel-Crafts alkylation), which would introduce the tert-butyl group. But wait, nitro is a deactivating group, making the ring less reactive. So Friedel-Crafts may not proceed if the ring is deactivated.

Wait, no. Friedel-Crafts alkylation requires an activating group. Nitro is deactivating, so after nitration, the ring is not reactive enough for Friedel-Crafts. So that's a problem. So maybe the order is different.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced first. But how? Let me think. To add an ethoxy group, perhaps via a nucleophilic substitution. But benzene is not nucleophilic. Wait, maybe we can first introduce a strong activating group, like a methyl group, but that's not part of the target.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution after the ring is made more reactive. Wait, another approach: perhaps using the hydroxyl group as an activating group. For example, introducing a hydroxyl group via some method, then converting it to ethoxy.

Wait, that might be a possibility. Let's think: benzene → nitration → nitrobenzene. Then, perhaps introducing a leaving group adjacent to the nitro, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe first introduce the ethoxy group, then nitrate.

Wait, but ethoxy is an activating group, so after adding ethoxy, nitration would substitute in the ortho or para positions relative to the ethoxy group. Then, adding the tert-butyl group would be another step.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to first add the tert-butyl group, then the ethoxy, then the nitro. But I need to think about the directing effects.

Wait, perhaps let's try to outline the steps systematically.

The target has three substituents: ethoxy, tert-butyl, and nitro. Let's denote their positions as 1, 2, and 3 on the benzene ring. Let's assume that in the target, the nitro is at position 3, ethoxy at 1, and tert-butyl at 2. So in terms of meta and para, this arrangement may be possible through certain reaction sequences.

Let me think of the order of adding the substituents. Maybe the first substituent is a meta director, then the next is an ortho/para director, etc.

Optionally, perhaps the correct order is to add the ethoxy group first, then the nitro group, which would be directed meta to the ethoxy, and then the tert-butyl group, which would have to be in an ortho or para position relative to either.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the nitro is added first.

Wait, let's plan this. Let me think about each possible option.

Looking at the options, each option gives a sequence of reactions. Let me try to process each option's steps.

Option A: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → this is Friedel-Crafts alkylation. So benzene reacts with tert-butyl chloride in presence of AlCl3 to make tert-butyl benzene. Then ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration. Then iii) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonation. Then iv) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization. Then v) dilute H2SO4 → hydrolysis. Then vi) H3O+, H2O, heat → perhaps more hydrolysis? Then vii) NaOH/EtBr → ethoxy group substitution. Hmm, I'm not sure about this sequence.

Wait, but after Friedel-Crafts, the ring is activated. So nitration in step ii would add nitro group. Then sulfonation (iii) would add a sulfonic acid group. Then, step iv diazotization would require an amine. Wait, but we don't have an amine yet. So this might not be the right approach.

Alternatively, perhaps after sulfonation, the sulfonic acid could act as a leaving group. Let me think: sulfonating the ring would add a -SO3H group, which is a strong meta director. But if we then do a diazotization, maybe that's to introduce a nitro group via some other pathway, but I'm a bit confused.

Option B: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → FC alkylation, so benzene → tert-butyl benzene. ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration. Then iii) Fe/HCl → this is usually for reducing nitro groups. So nitrobenzene would become phenyl amine. But wait, in the target, we have a nitro group, so maybe that's not the right step. Alternatively, perhaps after nitration, we then do something else.

Option C: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → FC alkylation → tert-butyl benzene. ii) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonate. iii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate. Then iv) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine. Then v) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization. vi) HNO3/H2SO4 → another nitration? vii) H3O+, H2O/Heat → hydrolysis. viii) dilute H2SO4 → possibly acid workup. ix) NaOH/EtBr → O-ethylation.

Wait, but if you nitrate after sulfonation, the nitro group would be directed by the sulfonic acid group, which is meta. Then, after reducing, perhaps another nitration step? Not sure.

Option D: i) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrobenzene. ii) Fe/HCl → reduces nitro to amine. iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → FC alkylation. But wait, after nitro is reduced to amine, the ring is activated (amine is strong activating, ortho/para director). Then, FC alkylation would introduce tert-butyl. But FC alkylation needs an activating group. So after amine, yes. Then, iv) HNO3 → nitrate again. Hmm.

Wait, but let's go through each option's steps to see which sequence makes sense.

The target molecule has nitro, ethoxy, and tert-butyl groups. Let's think about the order of adding these substituents.

In the target molecule, let's imagine that the nitro group is in the meta position relative to the ethoxy group. Because nitro is a meta director, and ethoxy is an ortho/para director. But in the target, ethoxy is at position 1, nitro at 3, and tert-butyl at 2.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think about the order of adding substituents. Let's think about the possible orders:

Option 1: Add tert-butyl first (since it's a bulky group, maybe it's better to add it early when the ring is more reactive), then add ethoxy, then nitrate.

Option 2: Add ethoxy first, then nitrate, then add tert-butyl.

Option 3: Add nitro first, then ethoxy, then tert-butyl.

I need to see which order allows each substituent to direct the next correctly.

Let me try option 2: Ethoxy first, then nitro, then tert-butyl.

After adding ethoxy, the ring is activated (ethoxy is activating). So when we nitrate, the nitro group would go into ortho or para to ethoxy. Let's say para. Then, when adding tert-butyl, where would it go? The nitro group is a meta director, so the tert-butyl would go meta to nitro, which might be ortho to ethoxy. Wait, but then we have two substituents, ethoxy and nitro, which may have their own directing effects.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro is para to ethoxy, and the tert-butyl is ortho to ethoxy, which is adjacent to nitro. That might fit the target structure.

But how would the steps work in terms of reactions.

Let's think about the reactions in option C: the steps are i) FC alkylation (tert-butyl), then ii) sulfonation, iii) nitration, then Fe/HCl (reduction), then diazotization, more nitration, hydrolysis, dilute H2SO4, and NaOH/EtBr.

Wait, that seems complicated. Maybe option D starts with nitration, then reduction, then FC alkylation.

Wait, let me think through each option step by step.

Option D's steps:

i) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduces nitro to NH2.

iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → FC alkylation. So benzene ring now has NH2 and tert-butyl groups.

Wait, but after nitro is reduced to NH2, the ring's activation is high. So FC alkylation would add tert-butyl in the para or ortho position relative to NH2.

Hmm, but the target has tert-butyl at position 2, ethoxy at 1, nitro at 3. Let me imagine the positions:

Nitro at position 3, ethoxy at position 1, tert-butyl at 2. So, in benzene, positions 1,2,3 are adjacent in a row. So if nitro is at position 3, ethoxy at 1 (para to nitro?), and tert-butyl at 2 (ortho to nitro, but that's not possible if nitro is already at 3).

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating the positions. Maybe it's better to think about the sequence of reactions for each option.

Looking back, the target is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So substituents are at positions 1,2,3. Let me number the ring so that substituents are in a meta arrangement.

But perhaps the order of adding groups is nitro first, then ethoxy, then tert-butyl.

Wait, here's another approach. Let me think about the possible intermediates for each option.

Option D:

Step i: Nitration → nitrobenzene.

Step ii: Reduction with Fe/HCl → amine group.

Step iii: FC alkylation → adds tert-butyl. Since the ring now has NH2, which is a strong activating group, the FC alkylation would add the tert-butyl group in the ortho or para position relative to NH2.

So after this, we have tert-butyl and NH2 on the ring. Then step iv: nitration again? Because the next step is iv) HNO3/H2SO4. But the ring now has two substituents: NH2 (activating, ortho/para) and tert-butyl (activating, ortho/para).

Wait, but after adding tert-butyl, the ring is still activated. So nitration would go into a position directed by the existing groups. But if there's an NH2 group, which is a strong activating group, it would dominate, directing the incoming nitro group to ortho or para positions relative to NH2.

Hmm, but the target has nitro at position 3, which would be meta to ethoxy at position 1. I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, maybe the correct sequence is to add ethoxy group first, then nitrate, then add tert-butyl.

Let me see how that would work.

But how to add ethoxy group. If I start with benzene, I can't do Friedel-Crafts for ethers because that's not feasible. So perhaps I need to introduce a leaving group first. Let me think: maybe I can nitrate first, then sulfonate, then substitute with ethoxy.

Wait, but sulfonation is a meta-directing reaction. So if I nitrate benzene first, getting nitro group (meta director), then sulfonate would add in meta to nitro, which is para to nitro. Then, substituting the sulfonic acid group with ethoxy. But how?

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Nitration → nitrobenzene.

2. Sulfonation → adds -SO3H in meta to nitro (so, if nitro is at position 1, sulfonic acid is at 3).

3. Then, substitute the sulfonic acid group with ethoxy. But how is that done?

Wait, substituting a sulfonic acid group with OEt would require some kind of nucleophilic substitution, but sulfonic acids are strong acids, and their conjugate base (-SO3^-) is not a good leaving group. Hmm, maybe that's not the right approach.

Alternatively, perhaps to perform an alkylation after activating the ring. Wait, perhaps using a directing group.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me try to look at each option's steps again.

Option A: i) FC alkylation → tert-butyl benzene.

ii) Nitration → nitro group added. Now, ring has tert-butyl and nitro groups.

But where does nitro go? Since tert-butyl is an activating group (ortho/para director), the nitro would be added ortho or para to tert-butyl.

Then, iii) sulfonation → adds sulfonic acid group, which is meta to the existing groups.

But I'm not sure how that helps in adding ethoxy.

Then, iv) NaNO2/HCl → this is for diazotization. But where is the amine group? We don't have any amine yet, so this step might not make sense.

Hmm, perhaps option A is not the right sequence.

Option B:

i) FC alkylation → tert-butyl benzene.

ii) Nitration → nitro added ortho/para to tert-butyl.

iii) Fe/HCl → reduces nitro to NH2.

iv) HNO3 → nitrate again. But the ring now has NH2, which is activating, so the nitro would be added ortho/para to NH2.

But the target only has one nitro group, so perhaps this step is incorrect.

Hmm.

Option C:

i) FC alkylation → tert-butyl benzene.

ii) Sulfonate → adds -SO3H in meta to tert-butyl (so, meta to the activating group).

iii) Nitrate → nitro group added in a position directed by sulfonic acid (which is deactivating, meta director) and tert-butyl (activating, ortho/para).

But nitro is a strong meta director, so it would go meta to the sulfonic acid. Hmm.

Hmm, not sure.

Option D:

i) Nitration → nitrobenzene.

ii) Reduction → NH2 benzene.

iii) FC alkylation → adds tert-butyl in ortho or para to NH2.

iv) Nitrate again → nitro group added, but now the ring has NH2 (ortho/para) and tert-butyl (ortho/para). The new nitro would go ortho/para to NH2.

But the target has only one nitro group, so this step would introduce another nitro, which is not desired. So option D seems incorrect.

Wait, but the target has only one nitro group. So any step that nitrates after having another activating group would add another nitro, which isn't desired. So options with multiple nitrations are probably wrong.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps another approach: the ethoxy group must be introduced via a nucleophilic substitution, which requires a good leaving group. So maybe we introduce a nitro group, then a sulfonic acid group, then substitute with ethoxy.

So:

1. Nitration → nitrobenzene.

2. Sulfonation → adds -SO3H in meta to nitro.

3. Substitute -SO3H with OEt.

But how to substitute -SO3H with OEt. The sulfonic acid group is a strong acid; perhaps first convert it to the sulfonate ester, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps after sulfonating nitrobenzene, we can perform a nucleophilic aromatic substitution with ethoxide. But that's difficult because the ring must be activated towards nucleophilic substitution, which usually requires strong electron-withdrawing groups.

Wait, but in this case, the ring has a nitro group (EWG) and a sulfonic acid group (another EWG). So perhaps the ring is sufficiently activated for nucleophilic substitution.

So, after sulfonating nitrobenzene to get 3-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid, perhaps we can perform a substitution reaction with ethoxide. But I'm not certain about the exact conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps we can use a nucleophilic substitution after activating the ring with strong activating groups, but that seems conflicting.

Alternatively, maybe the ethoxy group is introduced via a different method, like the Smith reaction or something else, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a Friedel-Crafts etherification. But wait, Friedel-Crafts is for alkylation, not for ethers. So that's not possible. Alternatively, perhaps via a nucleophilic substitution after making the ring activated.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution after activating the ring with strong electron-withdrawing groups.

Let me think, so perhaps the steps are:

1. Nitrate benzene → nitrobenzene.

2. Sulfonate → 3-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid.

3. Substitute sulfonic acid with ethoxy group. But how? Maybe via a reaction with ethoxide under high temperature or some other condition.

Wait, but that's a stretch. Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a coupling reaction, but that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps this sequence is not present in any of the options. Let me look back at the options.

Looking at option B: after nitration (ii), comes Fe/HCl, which reduces nitro to NH2. Then, HNO3 again. Hmm, but that adds another nitro group, which isn't desired.

Option A: after nitration (ii), then sulfonation, but then steps iv and v don't seem to add the ethoxy group.

Option C: after nitration (iii), then steps iv and v which involve Fe, diazotization, then more nitration, etc. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the ethoxy group being introduced via an elimination reaction.

Another approach: perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution after making the ring carry a good leaving group, like a tosyl group.

So, let's consider:

1. Benzene → nitro group via nitration.

2. Nitro group is at position 1.

3. Then, introduce a tosyl group (good leaving group) at position 2 via some reaction, perhaps sulfonation followed by something else.

4. Then, substitute the tosyl group with ethoxy via nucleophilic substitution.

But how to introduce the tosyl group in the correct position.

Wait, but let's think about the target structure. The substituents are at positions 1, 2, 3. If I have nitro at 3, ethoxy at 1, and tert-butyl at 2, perhaps the order is nitro first, then tert-butyl, then ethoxy.

Wait, but adding tert-butyl after nitro is tricky because the ring is deactivated.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is to add the ethoxy group first, then nitrate, then add tert-butyl.

But how to add ethoxy. Let's think:

Benzene → ethoxy group via Friedel-Crafts? No, because Friedel-Crafts is for alkylation, not O-alkylation. So maybe another method.

Wait, perhaps we can perform a nucleophilic substitution after activating the ring. Maybe by introducing a nitro group which is a meta director, then introducing a sulfonic acid group, which is a good leaving group, then substituting with ethoxy.

Yes! So, the steps would be:

1. Nitration → nitro group (meta director).

2. Sulfonation → sulfonic acid group added in meta to nitro.

3. Substitute the sulfonic acid group with ethoxy.

Then, add tert-butyl group.

Wait, but adding tert-butyl would require Friedel-Crafts alkylation, but after having ethoxy and nitro groups, which are deactivating, making the ring less reactive.

Hmm, that's a problem. Because Friedel-Crafts alkylation requires an activating group. If the ring has nitro and ethoxy, which are deactivating, the ring is deactivated, so FC won't work.

So, that approach might not work.

Alternatively, perhaps the tert-butyl is added first, then nitrate, then ethoxy via substitution.

But tert-butyl is an activating group (alkyl), so after adding it, nitration would be directed ortho/para to it. Then, substituting a leaving group with ethoxy.

Wait, let's outline this:

1. FC alkylation: benzene → tert-butyl benzene.

2. Nitration: adds nitro group ortho/para to tert-butyl.

3. Introduce a leaving group (like sulfonic acid) in a position directed by tert-butyl and nitro.

4. Substitute that leaving group with ethoxy.

But I'm not sure about the directing effects here.

Alternatively, perhaps after nitration, the next step is to introduce a leaving group, which can then be substituted with ethoxy.

Wait, but how would that fit into the options.

Looking back at the options, perhaps option C is the correct one.

Option C's steps:

i) FC alkylation → tert-butyl benzene.

ii) Sulfonate → adds -SO3H group, which is a meta director.

iii) Nitrate → nitro group added, now the ring has tert-butyl, -SO3H, and nitro.

Wait, but that seems to complicate things.

Alternatively, maybe the correct sequence is to first add nitro, then ethoxy via substitution, then add tert-butyl via FC alkylation. But the problem is that after nitro and ethoxy, the ring is deactivated, so FC may not work.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a nucleophilic substitution after the ring has a nitro group, which is a strong meta director, and a leaving group in the correct position.

So, the steps:

1. Nitrate benzene → nitrobenzene.

2. Sulfonate → adds -SO3H in meta to nitro (position 3 if nitro is at 1).

3. Substitute -SO3H with ethoxy → now ethoxy is at position 3.

4. Now, the ring has nitro (1) and ethoxy (3). Then, add tert-butyl via FC alkylation. But the ring is deactivated because of nitro and ethoxy (ethoxy is activating, though).

Wait, ethoxy is activating, so the ring is activated. So FC alkylation can proceed.

But where would the tert-butyl go? Since the ring has nitro (position 1) and ethoxy (position 3), the FC alkylation would be directed by the activating groups.

Ethoxy is at position 3, which is meta to position 1 (nitro). So the FC alkylation would add tert-butyl in the ortho or para positions relative to ethoxy, which are positions 2 or 4. But the target has tert-butyl at position 2.

So, that would fit. So:

After steps 1,2,3,4:

Nitro at 1, ethoxy at 3, tert-butyl at 2 → which is the target.

But how to get this sequence into the options.

Looking at the options, let's see which option includes these steps.

Looking at option B:

i) FC alkylation → tert-butyl benzene.

ii) Nitrate → nitro at ortho or para to tert-butyl.

iii) Fe/HCl → reduces nitro to NH2.

iv) Nitrate again → adds another nitro, which we don't want.

So option B seems incorrect.

Option C:

i) FC alkylation → tert-butyl.

ii) Sulfonate → adds -SO3H in meta to tert-butyl.

iii) Nitrate → adds nitro, perhaps in meta to -SO3H.

iv) Fe/HCl → reduces nitro to NH2.

v) Diazotization → NaNO2/HCl.

vi) HNO3 again → adds another nitro.

Hmm, no, that's not correct.

Option D:

i) Nitrate → nitro.

ii) Reduce → NH2.

iii) FC alkylation → adds tert-butyl ortho/para to NH2.

iv) Nitrate again → another nitro.

So again, not correct.

Option A:

i) FC alkylation → tert-butyl.

ii) Nitrate → nitro.

iii) Sulfonate → adds -SO3H.

iv) Diazotization → but where is the amine?

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Nitrate benzene → nitrobenzene.

2. Sulfonate → adds -SO3H in meta to nitro.

3. Substitute -SO3H with OEt.

4. Then, perform FC alkylation to add tert-butyl.

But the options don't have this exact sequence.

Looking at option C:

i) FC alkylation → tert-butyl.

ii) Sulfonate → adds -SO3H.

iii) Nitrate → nitro.

iv) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to NH2.

v) Diazotize → NaNO2/HCl.

vi) HNO3 again → nitrate.

Hmm, that adds two nitro groups, which is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is in option B, but I'm not seeing it.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is option B.

Wait, option B's steps:

i) FC alkylation → tert-butyl benzene.

ii) Nitrate → nitro group added in ortho or para to tert-butyl.

So, if the tert-butyl is at position 1, nitro could be at position 3 (meta), but wait, tert-butyl is an ortho/para director, so nitration would be at ortho (2) or para (4) positions.

Then, step iii: Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to NH2. So now, the ring has tert-butyl and NH2 groups.

Step iv: nitrate again → adds another nitro group.

But the target has only one nitro group, so this is incorrect.

Hmm.

Perhaps the correct sequence is in option C.

Option C:

i) FC alkylation → tert-butyl.

ii) Sulfonate → adds -SO3H in meta to tert-butyl.

iii) Nitrate → nitro group in positions directed by both -SO3H and tert-butyl.

Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is option C.

Another approach: let's think about the nitration steps. The target has a nitro group. So how many times is nitration done in each option?

Option A: nitration done once.

Option B: nitration done twice (steps ii and iv).

Option C: nitration done twice (steps iii and vi).

Option D: nitration done twice (steps i and iv).

But the target has only one nitro group. So options B, C, D have multiple nitrations, which may not be correct.

Wait, but perhaps in one of the options, the second nitration is not adding a nitro group but modifying an existing group.

Wait, for example, in option B, after the first nitration, the ring has a nitro group. Then, it's reduced to amine (NH2). Then, nitrate again → would that add another nitro group? Because after reduction, the ring is activated. So yes, that would add another nitro group, which is not desired.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is introduced once, and any other nitration steps are for modifying existing groups.

Wait, perhaps I'm mistaken about the number of nitro groups. Let me count in each option.

Option A: steps ii is nitration, others don't nitrate. So one nitro group.

Option B: steps ii and iv are nitrations → two nitro groups.

Option C: steps iii and vi are nitrations → two nitro groups.

Option D: steps i and iv → two nitro groups.

So only option A introduces nitration once. So perhaps option A is the correct one.

But wait, in option A, after FC alkylation (i), nitration (ii) would add nitro ortho/para to tert-butyl. Then, step iii is sulfonation.

But how does that lead to the target structure.

Wait, let's think:

Option A:

1. FC alkylation → tert-butyl benzene.

2. Nitration → nitro at ortho or para to tert-butyl.

Let's say nitro is at position 2 (ortho to tert-butyl at position 1).

3. Sulfonate → adds -SO3H in meta to existing groups.

Wait, but which group directs where the sulfonic acid goes? The ring has tert-butyl (activating, ortho/para) and nitro (deactivating, meta). So the sulfonic acid would be added in a position directed by the nitro group, which is meta to itself. So if nitro is at position 2, the sulfonic acid would be added at position 5 (meta to 2).

Hmm, but I'm not sure how that helps in getting the ethoxy group.

Then, step iv is NaNO2/HCl → diazotization. But where is the amine? The ring has nitro group, which can't be directly diazotized. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps after sulfonation, the -SO3H is converted to a leaving group, then substituted with ethoxy.

Wait, but in option A, steps iv to ix are:

iv) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

v) dilute H2SO4 → hydrolysis.

vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat → possibly hydrolysis again.

vii) NaOH/EtBr → ethoxy substitution.

viii) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonate again.

ix) dilute H2SO4 → ?

Hmm, this seems complicated. Perhaps after these steps, the ethoxy group is introduced via an SN2 mechanism.

Wait, perhaps the sequence is:

1. FC alkylation → tert-butyl.

2. Nitrate → nitro.

3. Sulfonate → -SO3H.

4. Diazotize → but no amine, so perhaps this is for something else.

Alternatively, perhaps after sulfonation, the ring is sulfonated, and then a substitution occurs.

But I'm getting stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is option B, despite having two nitro groups, but that would be incorrect.

Wait, maybe I should think about the order of reactions again.

Another approach: the ethoxy group must be introduced via a substitution after making a good leaving group. So perhaps:

1. Nitrate → nitro group.

2. Sulfonate → adds -SO3H meta to nitro.

3. Substitute -SO3H with OEt → ethoxy group.

4. Then, add tert-butyl via FC alkylation.

But, after steps 1,2,3, the ring has nitro and ethoxy groups. Ethoxy is activating, so FC alkylation can proceed, adding tert-butyl in ortho or para to ethoxy.

But in the target, tert-butyl is at position 2, while ethoxy is at 1 and nitro at 3.

So, in this scenario:

- Ethoxy at 1.

- Nitro at 3 (meta to ethoxy).

- Tert-butyl at 2 (ortho to ethoxy).

So, that fits.

So the steps are:

1. Nitrate → nitro at position 3.

2. Sulfonate → adds -SO3H at position 1 (meta to nitro at 3).

3. Substitute -SO3H with ethoxy → ethoxy at position 1.

4. FC alkylation → adds tert-butyl ortho to ethoxy (position 2).

But looking at the options, which option has this sequence: nitrate, sulfonate, substitute, then FC alkylation.

Looking at option C: steps i is FC alkylation, which is wrong order.

Option A: steps i is FC, then nitrate, which is opposite.

Option D: starts with nitrate, then reduce, then FC alkylation. Doesn't fit.

Hmm, none of the options have this exact sequence. So perhaps the correct option is not present, but that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is nitrate, then FC alkylation, then sulfonate, then substitute ethoxy.

But I need to see which option follows this.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps are:

1. FC alkylation → tert-butyl.

2. Nitrate → nitro in ortho/para to tert-butyl.

3. Sulfonate → adds -SO3H in meta to nitro.

4. Substitute -SO3H with ethoxy.

But let's see.

After step 4, ethoxy group is in meta to nitro, which is ortho to tert-butyl.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is option B.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating, and the correct option is option C.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is option B, where:

i) FC alkylation → tert-butyl.

ii) Nitrate → nitro at position 3.

iii) Fe/HCl → reduces nitro to NH2.

iv) Nitrate → adds another nitro group. But that's two nitro groups, which is not desired.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is option C.

Option C's steps:

i) FC alkylation → tert-butyl.

ii) Sulfonate → adds -SO3H.

iii) Nitrate → nitro added.

iv) Fe/HCl → reduces nitro to NH2.

v) Diazotization.

vi) Nitrate again.

But that's adding two nitro groups, which is incorrect.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the order of substituents. Let me look at the target molecule again: 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.

So substituents are at positions 1 (ethoxy), 2 (tert-butyl), 3 (nitro).

Let me imagine the benzene ring with these substituents in order.

So, ethoxy at position 1, tert-butyl at 2 (ortho to ethoxy), and nitro at 3 (meta to ethoxy, which is at 1, and also adjacent to tert-butyl at 2).

So, when adding substituents, perhaps the order is ethoxy, then tert-butyl, then nitro.

But how to add ethoxy first.

Wait, but how to add ethoxy group to benzene. Perhaps via a nucleophilic substitution after making a good leaving group.

So steps could be:

1. Nitrate → nitro at position 3.

2. Sulfonate → adds -SO3H at position 1.

3. Substitute -SO3H with ethoxy → ethoxy at position 1.

4. FC alkylation → adds tert-butyl at position 2 (ortho to ethoxy).

But looking at the options, do any of them have this order: nitrate, sulfonate, substitute, then FC alkylation.

Looking at the options:

Option C has FC alkylation first, then sulfonate, then nitrate.

Hmm, no.

Option A: FC alkylation, nitrate, sulfonate, etc.

No.

Option B: FC alkylation, nitrate, reduce, nitrate again.

No.

Option D: nitrate, reduce, FC alkylation, nitrate again.

Hmm.

I think I'm stuck, but perhaps the correct option is option C.

Wait, let me think of the steps in option C:

i) FC alkylation → tert-butyl.

ii) Sulfonate → adds -SO3H in meta to tert-butyl → position 4 if tert-butyl is at 1.

iii) Nitrate → nitro added, directed by -SO3H (meta) and tert-butyl (ortho/para).

So nitro could be at position 3 (meta to -SO3H at 4? Not sure).

iv) Fe/HCl → reduces nitro to NH2.

v) Diazotization → NaNO2/HCl.

vi) HNO3 again → nitration.

Hmm, but this adds another nitro, which is not desired.

I'm not making progress. Perhaps I should think of the correct steps:

The correct steps are:

1. Nitrate benzene → nitro at position 3.

2. Sulfonate → adds -SO3H at position 1.

3. Substitute -SO3H with ethoxy → ethoxy at 1.

4. FC alkylation → adds tert-butyl at position 2.

But looking for an option with nitrate, sulfonate, substitution, then FC alkylation.

Not seeing it in the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is option C, despite the extra nitration.

But I'm not confident. Another approach: perhaps the correct answer is option C.

Wait, perhaps the steps in option C are:

i) FC alkylation → tert-butyl.

ii) Sulfonate → adds -SO3H.

iii) Nitrate → adds nitro.

iv) Fe/HCl → reduces nitro to NH2.

v) Diazotize → forms diazonium salt.

vi) HNO3 → hydrolyzes diazonium to nitro again. Wait, but that would add another nitro.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the diazonium salt undergoes some other reaction, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C.

After going through all the options, I think the correct option is C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene, the sequence of reactions must carefully consider the directing effects of substituents and the reactivity of the aromatic ring. The target molecule has three substituents: a tert-butyl group at position 2, an ethoxy group at position 1, and a nitro group at position 3. The order of introducing these groups is critical, as each substituent influences the position of the next.

### Key Analysis of the Options:

#### **Option A**:
1. **tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃**: Friedel-Crafts alkylation introduces the tert-butyl group.
2. **HNO₃/H₂SO₄**: Nitration adds a nitro group ortho/para to the tert-butyl group.
3. **SO₃/H₂SO₄**: Sulfonation adds a sulfonic acid group.
4. **NaNO₂/HCl**: Diazotization, but no amine is present to justify this step.
5. **dilute H₂SO₄**: Hydrolysis, but its purpose is unclear.
6. **H₃O⁺, H₂O/Heat**: Further hydrolysis, but its role is ambiguous.
7. **NaOH/EtBr**: Substitution to introduce the ethoxy group.
8. **SO₃/H₂SO₄**: Sulfonation again, which is unnecessary.
9. **dilute H₂SO₄**: Unclarified purpose.

This sequence does not align with the target structure, as the nitro and ethoxy groups are not introduced in the correct positions.

#### **Option B**:
1. **tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃**: Friedel-Crafts alkylation introduces the tert-butyl group.
2. **HNO₃/H₂SO₄**: Nitration adds a nitro group ortho/para to the tert-butyl group.
3. **Fe/HCl**: Reduction of the nitro group to an amine.
4. **HNO₃/H₂SO₄**: Nitration again, adding another nitro group.
5. **NaNO₂/HCl**: Diazotization of the newly introduced nitro group.
6. **H₃O⁺, H₂O/Heat**: Hydrolysis, but its purpose is unclear.
7. **NaOH/EtBr**: Substitution to introduce the ethoxy group.
8. **SO₃/H₂SO₄**: Sulfonation, which is unnecessary.
9. **dilute H₂SO₄**: Unclarified purpose.

This sequence introduces two nitro groups, which is inconsistent with the target molecule that has only one nitro group.

#### **Option C**:
1. **tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃**: Friedel-Crafts alkylation introduces the tert-butyl group.
2. **SO₃/H₂SO₄**: Sulfonation adds a sulfonic acid group.
3. **HNO₃/H₂SO₄**: Nitration adds a nitro group.
4. **Fe/HCl**: Reduction of the nitro group to an amine.
5. **NaNO₂/HCl**: Diazotization of the amine.
6. **HNO₃/H₂SO₄**: Nitration again, adding another nitro group.
7. **H₃O⁺, H₂O/Heat**: Hydrolysis, but its purpose is unclear.
8. **dilute H₂SO₄**: Unclarified purpose.
9. **NaOH/EtBr**: Substitution to introduce the ethoxy group.

This sequence also introduces two nitro groups, which is inconsistent with the target molecule.

#### **Option D**:
1. **HNO₃/H₂SO₄**: Nitration introduces a nitro group.
2. **Fe/HCl**: Reduction of the nitro group to an amine.
3. **tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃**: Friedel-Crafts alkylation introduces the tert-butyl group.
4. **HNO₃/H₂SO₄**: Nitration again, adding another nitro group.
5. **NaNO₂/HCl**: Diazotization of the newly introduced nitro group.
6. **SO₃/H₂SO₄**: Sulfonation, which is unnecessary.
7. **dilute H₂SO₄**: Unclarified purpose.
8. **H₃O⁺, H₂O/Heat**: Hydrolysis, but its purpose is unclear.
9. **NaOH/EtBr**: Substitution to introduce the ethoxy group.

This sequence introduces two nitro groups, which is inconsistent with the target molecule.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing all options, none of the sequences perfectly align with the target structure. However, **Option C** comes closest, as it includes the necessary steps to introduce the tert-butyl, nitro, and ethoxy groups, even though it introduces an additional nitro group. Given the constraints of the options, **Option C** is the most plausible choice.
