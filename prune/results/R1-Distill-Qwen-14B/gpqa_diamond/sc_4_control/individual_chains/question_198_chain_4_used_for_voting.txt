Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, I need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all the cobalt species in the solution. Let me break this down step by step.

First, the problem gives me the concentrations: [Co²+] is 1e-2 M and [SCN^-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Wait, I think stability constants are for different complexes, like Co(SCN)_n²+ where n increases. So β1 is for the first complex, maybe Co(SCN), β2 for the second, Co(SCN)₂, and so on.

I remember that the stability constant (β) tells us how stable a complex is. The higher the β, the more the complex will form. So for each complex, the concentration can be found using the β values.

But wait, the question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex. I'm a bit unsure which complex is the blue one. Dithiocyanato would mean two SCN ligands. So I think that's the Co(SCN)₂²+ complex, which would be the second complex with β2=40. Or wait, maybe the fourth? No, β4 is 16, which is lower than β3. Hmm. Or perhaps the blue is the [Co(SCN)_4]^3-? I'm getting confused.

Wait, I think the color changes with different ligand numbers. For example, [Co(SCN)]^+ is pink, [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ is blue, [Co(SCN)_3]^3- is green, and [Co(SCN)_4]^4- is brown or something. Oh wait, but wait, the problem states "dithiocyanato" which means two SCN ligands. So that would be [Co(SCN)_2]^2+.

So the question is about the percentage of [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ (the second complex) in the solution.

To find this, I think I need to calculate the distribution of all the cobalt species. That is, find the concentrations of each complex and then see what fraction the second complex contributes.

The general approach is to consider all possible complexes and their formation based on the stability constants. But with multiple complexes, the formation is cumulative. So each complex is formed from the previous one by adding another SCN⁻.

The formula for each complex is:

[Co(SCN)_n]^(2-n) = β_n [Co²+][SCN^-]^n

But wait, actually, the formation is stepwise. Each β is for adding one SCN at a time. So the overall formation constant for [Co(SCN)_4]^4- would be β1*β2*β3*β4. But for each individual step, the concentration is given by the product of βs up to that point.

Wait, maybe I should model the problem using the formation of each complex step by step.

Let me denote the species as Co²+ (free ion), [CoSCN]^+ (n=1), [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ (n=2, which is the one we care about), [Co(SCN)_3]^3- (n=3), and [Co(SCN)_4]^4- (n=4).

Each step's concentration is the product of the previous β and the free Co²+ and the excess SCN⁻. But wait, the total cobalt is 1e-2 M; but some is in each complex. So the sum of all Co species (including free Co²+) must equal 1e-2 M.

Wait, but the initial idea is that the Co²+ can form complexes with varying numbers of SCN⁻. The stability constants are given, so the formation of each complex depends on the β and the concentrations of Co²+ and SCN⁻.

Hmm, but because the problem gives the total Co concentration, we have to account for all the complexes.

So, let me think about the general approach. We can model the distribution using the stability constants and the concentrations.

The formula for each complex is:

[Co(SCN)_n]^(2−n) = β_n [Co²+] [SCN^-]^n

But wait, that's not entirely correct because each subsequent β is for the next step. The overall β for the nth complex is the product of β1 to βn. Or is it the stepwise β? I think each β is for adding each SCN, so the concentration of the nth complex is:

[CoSCN_n]^charge = (β1 β2 β3 ... βn) [Co²+][SCN^-]^n / [some denominator?]

Wait, no, perhaps each β is for the nth ionization. For example, β1 is K1 = [CoSCN+]/([Co²+][SCN^-]). Similarly, β2 is K2 = [Co(SCN)_2²+]/([CoSCN+][SCN^-]). So the overall β for [Co(SCN)_2]²+ would be β1 * β2.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, the stepwise formation constants are given by β1, β2, etc. So, each β corresponds to the addition of one SCN⁻. So, the overall formation constant for [Co(SCN)_2]²+ is β1 * β2.

Wait, perhaps that's the way to go. Let me write the formation steps:

1. Co²+ + SCN⁻ ↔ CoSCN+; β1 = [CoSCN+]/([Co²+][SCN⁻]) = 9
2. CoSCN+ + SCN⁻ ↔ Co(SCN)_2²+; β2 = [Co(SCN)_2²+]/([CoSCN+][SCN⁻]) =40
3. Co(SCN)_2²+ + SCN⁻ ↔ Co(SCN)_3^3-; β3=63
4. Co(SCN)_3^3- + SCN⁻ ↔ Co(SCN)_4^4-; β4=16

So, the overall β for each complex is the product of the stepwise βs up to that point.

So, the concentrations of each complex can be expressed as:

[CoSCN+] = β1 [Co²+][SCN⁻] = 9 * [Co²+] * 0.1

[Co(SCN)_2²+] = β1 * β2 * [Co²+] * [SCN⁻]^2 =9*40 * [Co²+] * (0.1)^2

Wait, but wait, no. Because each step's concentration depends on the previous. So, [CoSCN+] = β1 [Co²+][SCN⁻]

[Co(SCN)_2²+] = β2 [CoSCN+][SCN⁻] = β2 * β1 [Co²+][SCN⁻]^2

[Co(SCN)_3^3-] = β3 [Co(SCN)_2²+][SCN⁻] = β3 β2 β1 [Co²+][SCN⁻]^3

Similarly, [Co(SCN)_4^4-] = β4 [Co(SCN)_3^3-][SCN⁻] = β4 β3 β2 β1 [Co²+][SCN⁻]^4

Wait, but that's correct because each step builds on the previous. So, to find each concentration, you multiply the step constants and the concentrations of the required species.

So, the total concentration of all Co species is:

[Co²+] + [CoSCN+] + [Co(SCN)_2²+] + [Co(SCN)_3^3-] + [Co(SCN)_4^4-] = 1e-2 M.

Let me denote [Co²+] as x. Then each complex's concentration can be written in terms of x.

Let me compute each complex's concentration:

[CoSCN+] = β1 x (0.1) = 9 * x * 0.1 = 0.9 x

[Co(SCN)_2²+] = β1 β2 x (0.1)^2 = 9*40 x (0.01) = 360 x * 0.01 = 3.6 x

Wait, 9 *40 is 360, and (0.1)^2 is 0.01, so 360 *0.01 =3.6. So [Co(SCN)_2²+] =3.6 x.

[Co(SCN)_3^3-] = β1 β2 β3 x (0.1)^3 =9*40*63 x (0.001) → 9*40=360, 360*63=22680. 22680 * 0.001=22.68 → 22.68 x.

Wait, 9*40=360, 360*63=22680? Let me compute: 63*360. 60*360=21600, 3*360=1080; total 22680. Yes.

So [Co(SCN)_3^3-] = 22680 * 0.001 *x → 22.68 x.

[Co(SCN)_4^4-] = β1 β2 β3 β4 x (0.1)^4 =9*40*63*16 x (0.0001).

Let me compute that: 9*40=360, 360*63=22680, 22680*16=362,880. (0.1)^4=0.0001. So 362880 *0.0001 =36.288. So [Co(SCN)_4^4-]=36.288 x.

Wait, wait. Hmm, I think I made a mistake here. Because each β is for the stepwise addition, so the overall β for the fourth complex is β1 * β2 * β3 * β4. But wait, the [Co(SCN)_4^4-] is equal to β4 * [Co(SCN)_3^3-] * [SCN⁻], and [Co(SCN)_3^3-] is β3 * [Co(SCN)_2²+] * [SCN⁻], etc. So the way I computed each concentration in terms of x is correct.

Wait, but when I compute [Co(SCN)_4^4-], it's β4 * [Co(SCN)_3^3-] * [SCN⁻], which is β4 * (β3 * β2 * β1 [Co²+][SCN^-]^3) ) * [SCN^-] → β4 β3 β2 β1 [Co²+][SCN^-]^4.

So yes, that's correct.

So, the concentrations:

[Co²+] = x

[CoSCN+] =9 * x *0.1 =0.9 x

[Co(SCN)_2²+] =9*40 * x * (0.1)^2= 360 * 0.01 x=3.6 x

[Co(SCN)_3^3-] =9*40*63 * x * (0.1)^3= 22680 * 0.001 x=22.68 x

[Co(SCN)_4^4-] =9*40*63*16 * x * (0.1)^4= 362880 * 0.0001 x=36.288 x

Wait, but I think I might have miscalculated the [Co(SCN)_4^4-]. Let me recompute that step.

Compute β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

β1*β2=360, β3=63 → 360*63=22680. Then 22680 *16=362880. Yes.

So [Co(SCN)_4^4-] =362880 * x * (0.1)^4 → 0.1^4 is 0.0001. So 362880 *0.0001 =36.288. So yes, 36.288 x.

Now, sum all the concentrations:

x + 0.9x +3.6x +22.68x +36.288x = total Co concentration =1e-2 M.

Adding the coefficients:

1 +0.9=1.9 → +3.6=5.5 → +22.68=28.18 → +36.288=64.468.

So, 64.468 x = 1e-2 → x = (1e-2)/64.468 ≈ 1.55e-4 M.

Wait, 1e-2 is 0.01. So 0.01 /64.468 → let me compute that. 

64.468 → let's approximate it as 64.47.

0.01 /64.47 ≈ 0.0001551. So x≈1.551e-4 M.

So [Co²+] is 1.551e-4 M.

Now, the concentration of [Co(SCN)_2²+] is 3.6 x → 3.6 *1.551e-4. Let's compute that.

3.6 *1.551e-4 = approx 5.5836e-4 M.

Wait, 1.551e-4 *3.6 → 3.6 *1.551 ≈5.5836 → 5.5836e-4 M.

Now, to find the percentage of [Co(SCN)_2²+] among all Co species.

The total concentration of all Co species is 0.01 M. The concentration of [Co(SCN)_2²+] is 5.5836e-4 M. So the percentage is (5.5836e-4 / 0.01) *100%.

Wait, but wait: 5.5836e-4 is 0.00055836. Divided by 0.01 (which is 0.01) → 0.055836. Multiply by 100% →5.5836%.

But wait, that's only about 5.5%, which is not one of the options. The options are around 16%, 25%, 38%, 42%. Hmm, that can't be right. So I must have made a mistake in my approach.

Wait, maybe I inverted some steps or miscalculated the βs. Alternatively, perhaps I confused the order of βs. Let me double-check.

Wait, the problem says the stability constants are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Wait, β4 is lower than β3. That seems odd because usually the stability constants increase up to a point and then may decrease, but maybe the data is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should re-express the way I compute the [Co(SCN)_n] concentrations. Alternatively, perhaps I should not have multiplied all the βs together but considered each step separately.

Wait, another approach is to use the cumulative β's for each complex. The cumulative β for [Co(SCN)_n] would be the product of β1 to βn.

Wait, for [CoSCN+], the cumulative β is β1 =9.

For [Co(SCN)_2²+], it's β1*β2 =9*40=360.

For [Co(SCN)_3^3-], β1*β2*β3=9*40*63=22680.

For [Co(SCN)_4^4-], β1*β2*β3*β4=22680 *16=362880.

So the concentrations would be:

[Co²+] = x

[CoSCN+] = β1 x [SCN^-] =9x *0.1=0.9x

[Co(SCN)_2²+] = β1β2 x [SCN^-]^2=360 x (0.1)^2=360 *0.01 x=3.6x

[Co(SCN)_3^3-] = β1β2β3 x [SCN^-]^3=22680 x (0.1)^3=22680 * 0.001 x=22.68 x

[Co(SCN)_4^4-] = β1β2β3β4 x [SCN^-]^4=362880 x (0.1)^4=362880 * 0.0001 x=36.288 x

Wait, same as before. So summing these gives 64.468x = 1e-2 → x=1e-2 /64.468 ≈1.55e-4.

So [Co(SCN)_2²+] is 3.6x=3.6*1.55e-4=5.58e-4 M.

This is 5.58e-4 / 0.01 = 0.0558 →5.58% which is way lower than the options given. So there must be a mistake in my approach.

Wait, perhaps I forgot that each [Co(SCN)_n] is a separate species, but the way I calculate their concentrations might be wrong. Alternatively, maybe I'm not considering the correct cumulative βs.

Alternatively, perhaps the way I model the problem is incorrect. Let me think again.

Another approach is to model this using the formation of each complex step by step. Each step's concentration is the product of the previous step multiplied by β and [SCN^-]. But perhaps the problem arises because I'm using the wrong way to model the cumulative effect of βs.

Wait, perhaps I should model it as a distribution problem where the sum of all species is 0.01 M. Let me write each species in terms of x (which is [Co²+]).

So, [Co(SCN)_n] = (β1 β2 ... βn) [Co²+][SCN^-]^n

Wait, but that's the same as before.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a denominator in the calculation. For example, perhaps each β is for the reaction Co²+ + SCN⁻ → CoSCN+, but for [Co(SCN)_2]²+, it's CoSCN+ + SCN⁻ → [Co(SCN)_2]²+, so the concentration is β2 [CoSCN+][SCN^-], which is β2 * β1 [Co²+][SCN^-]^2.

Yes, that's correct. So the concentration of [Co(SCN)_2]²+ is β1 β2 x (0.1)^2 =360 x 0.01=3.6 x.

But why is the percentage so low? The options suggest that the percentage is higher. Could it be that I'm miscalculating x?

Wait, let me recompute the sum again. The sum of all species is x + 0.9x +3.6x +22.68x +36.288x.

Wait, x is [Co²+], 0.9x is [CoSCN+], 3.6x [Co(SCN)_2], 22.68x [Co(SCN)_3], 36.288x [Co(SCN)_4].

So adding all these: 1 +0.9+3.6=5.5, 5.5+22.68=28.18, 28.18+36.288=64.468.

So 64.468 x =0.01 → x=0.01 /64.468 → yes, about 0.000155 M.

So [Co(SCN)_2] is3.6 * 0.000155 → 0.000558 M.

Total Co is 0.01 M. So the fraction is 0.000558 /0.01 →0.0558, which is 5.58%.

But the options are way higher. So perhaps I've missed something. Let me read the question again.

Ah, wait a minute. The question mentions "the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes." Dithiocyanato would be two SCN ligands, so that's [Co(SCN)_2]²+. But perhaps the problem refers to the dithiocyanato as the [Co(SCN)_2]^+ complex? No, because dithiocyanato would imply two SCN.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the blue is the [Co(SCN)_4]^4- complex, but that would be the fourth complex, and we have [Co(SCN)_4]^4- as 36.288 x. Which would be 36.288 *1.55e-4 = approx 5.62e-3 M. That would be 5.62e-3 /0.01 =56.2% → but that's not one of the options either.

Wait, perhaps I have the wrong β values for the complexes. Oh, wait! I think I might have confused β1, β2, etc. Perhaps the [Co(SCN)_2]²+ has a β of β2=40, not the product β1 β2=360.

Wait, that's where I went wrong. Because β1 is for the first complex, β2 for the second, etc. So each step's β is just the next term, not the product. So the concentrations might be computed differently.

Wait, let me think again. Let me model each step correctly.

The formation of [CoSCN]^+ is given by β1 = [CoSCN+]/([Co²+][SCN^-}) → [CoSCN+] = β1 [Co²+][SCN^-].

The formation of [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ is from [CoSCN+] adding another SCN⁻, with β2 = [Co(SCN)_2²+]/([CoSCN+][SCN^-}).

So [Co(SCN)_2²+] = β2 [CoSCN+][SCN^-} = β2 * β1 [Co²+][SCN^-}^2.

Similarly, [Co(SCN)_3^3-] = β3 [Co(SCN)_2²+][SCN^-} = β3 * β2 * β1 [Co²+][SCN^-}^3.

And [Co(SCN)_4^4-} = β4 [Co(SCN)_3^3-][SCN^-} = β4 * β3*β2 *β1 [Co²+][SCN^-}^4.

So, the previous approach was correct, but perhaps it's leading to a lower percentage than expected.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the βs are for the overall formation. But some sources define stability constants as the overall, not the stepwise. Wait, that might be the case. So I might have confused the stepwise β with the overall.

Wait, what if β is the overall stability constant for the entire complex, not stepwise? That would change everything.

In that case, the β for [CoSCN+] would be β1=9. The β for [Co(SCN)_2]²+ would be β2=40, which would mean [Co(SCN)_2²+] = β2 [Co²+][SCN^-]^2.

Hmm, but that can't be, because formation is stepwise. Alternatively, perhaps the βs are given as overall constants, not stepwise. Let me check.

If β1 is the overall constant for [CoSCN+], then β1 = [CoSCN+]/([Co²+][SCN^-}) =9.

For [Co(SCN)_2]^2+, the overall β would be [Co(SCN)_2²+]/([Co²+][SCN^-]^2) = β2=40.

Similarly, [Co(SCN)_3^3-} = β3 [Co²+][SCN^-}^3.

Wait, but in that case, each β represents the overall formation constant for that particular complex, not the stepwise. So the βs are not sequential but each represents the overall for that n.

In that case, the concentrations would be:

[CoSCN+] = β1 [Co²+][SCN^-} =9x *0.1=0.9x

[Co(SCN)_2²+] = β2 [Co²+][SCN^-}^2 =40x * (0.1)^2=40x *0.01=0.4x

[Co(SCN)_3^3-} = β3x [SCN^-}^3 =63 x (0.1)^3=63*0.001 x=0.063 x

[Co(SCN)_4^4-} = β4 x [SCN^-}^4 =16x (0.1)^4=16 *0.0001 x=0.0016x

So now, sum all species:

x (free Co²+) +

0.9x ([CoSCN+}) +

0.4x ([Co(SCN)_2²+}) +

0.063x ([Co(SCN)_3^3-}) +

0.0016x ([Co(SCN)_4^4-})

Total = x +0.9x +0.4x +0.063x +0.0016x = (1 +0.9+0.4+0.063+0.0016) x = (2.3646) x =0.01 M.

So x=0.01 /2.3646≈0.004227 M.

Wait, that's significantly higher than before. Now, [Co(SCN)_2²+] is 0.4x →0.4 *0.004227=0.0016908 M.

So the percentage is (0.0016908 /0.01) *100% =16.908% → approximately 16.9%.

Looking at the options, option D is 16.9%.

Wait, but earlier when I considered the stepwise βs, I got a much lower percentage, but now with overall βs, I get 16.9% which matches option D.

So perhaps the problem states that the βs are the overall stability constants, not the stepwise ones. That would explain the correct answer.

So the correct approach is to treat the βs as the overall formation constants, not stepwise. So each β_n is [Co(SCN)_n]^(2−n) / ([Co²+][SCN^-]^n).

In that case, [Co(SCN)_2]²+ has a concentration of β2 [Co²+][SCN^-]^2 =40 x (0.1)^2=40x *0.01=0.4x.

Then, summing all species gives x=0.004227 M, so [Co(SCN)_2²+] is 0.4 *0.004227=0.0016908 M.

Percentage is 16.908%, which matches option D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)₂]²⁺, among all cobalt-containing species in the solution, we analyze the distribution of cobalt species using the given stability constants (β). The problem provides the following data:

- Total cobalt concentration: $c(\text{Co}) = 10^{-2} \, \text{M}$
- Thiosulfate concentration: $[\text{SCN}^-] = 0.1 \, \text{M}$
- Stability constants: $\beta_1 = 9$, $\beta_2 = 40$, $\beta_3 = 63$, $\beta_4 = 16$

### Key Assumptions and Approach
1. The stability constants are interpreted as **overall formation constants** for each complex, not stepwise constants. This means:
   - $\beta_1 = [\text{CoSCN}^+]/([\text{Co}^{2+}][\text{SCN}^-])$
   - $\beta_2 = [\text{Co(SCN)}_2^{2+}]/([\text{Co}^{2+}][\text{SCN}^-]^2)$
   - $\beta_3 = [\text{Co(SCN)}_3^{3-}]/([\text{Co}^{2+}][\text{SCN}^-]^3)$
   - $\beta_4 = [\text{Co(SCN)}_4^{4-}]/([\text{Co}^{2+}][\text{SCN}^-]^4)$

2. The concentrations of all cobalt species are expressed in terms of the free cobalt ion concentration, $x = [\text{Co}^{2+}]$, and the given stability constants and thiosulfate concentration.

3. The total cobalt concentration is the sum of all cobalt species:
   \[
   [\text{Co}^{2+}] + [\text{CoSCN}^+] + [\text{Co(SCN)}_2^{2+}] + [\text{Co(SCN)}_3^{3-}] + [\text{Co(SCN)}_4^{4-}] = 10^{-2} \, \text{M}.
   \]

### Calculations
1. **Concentrations of cobalt species**:
   - $[\text{CoSCN}^+] = \beta_1 [\text{Co}^{2+}][\text{SCN}^-] = 9x(0.1) = 0.9x$
   - $[\text{Co(SCN)}_2^{2+}] = \beta_2 [\text{Co}^{2+}][\text{SCN}^-]^2 = 40x(0.1)^2 = 0.4x$
   - $[\text{Co(SCN)}_3^{3-}] = \beta_3 [\text{Co}^{2+}][\text{SCN}^-]^3 = 63x(0.1)^3 = 0.063x$
   - $[\text{Co(SCN)}_4^{4-}] = \beta_4 [\text{Co}^{2+}][\text{SCN}^-]^4 = 16x(0.1)^4 = 0.0016x$

2. **Sum of all cobalt species**:
   \[
   [\text{Co}^{2+}] + [\text{CoSCN}^+] + [\text{Co(SCN)}_2^{2+}] + [\text{Co(SCN)}_3^{3-}] + [\text{Co(SCN)}_4^{4-}] = x + 0.9x + 0.4x + 0.063x + 0.0016x = 2.3646x.
   \]
   Since the total cobalt concentration is $10^{-2} \, \text{M}$:
   \[
   2.3646x = 10^{-2} \implies x = \frac{10^{-2}}{2.3646} \approx 4.227 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{M}.
   \]

3. **Concentration of [Co(SCN)₂]²⁺**:
   \[
   [\text{Co(SCN)}_2^{2+}] = 0.4x = 0.4(4.227 \times 10^{-3}) \approx 1.691 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{M}.
   \]

4. **Percentage of [Co(SCN)₂]²⁺**:
   \[
   \text{Percentage} = \left(\frac{[\text{Co(SCN)}_2^{2+}]}{c(\text{Co})}\right) \times 100 = \left(\frac{1.691 \times 10^{-3}}{10^{-2}}\right) \times 100 \approx 16.9\%.
   \]

### Final Answer
The percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)₂]²⁺, among all cobalt-containing species in the solution is **16.9%**.

ANSWER: D
