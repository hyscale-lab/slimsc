Okay, I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

So, Compound X has certain IR and NMR data, and it reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I need to figure out the final product. The options are A, B, C, D.

Let me start by analyzing the spectral data to figure out what Compound X is.

First, the IR data: 3400–2500 cm-1. That broad region usually indicates O-H or N-H stretching. But looking at the options, they are all either acids or substituted benzenes. So maybe an acid? Because the IR has a peak around 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. That could be from a carboxylic acid or an ester or ketone. But 1720 is more like a carboxylic acid (maybe a bit lower for an ester? I'm a bit fuzzy on that). Also, another peak at 1610 and 1450 cm-1. Those are in the range for aromatic C=C stretching. So maybe the compound has an aromatic ring with substituents.

Looking at the NMR data. The 1H NMR shows:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): A broad singlet around 10.5 is probably an -OH proton, like from a carboxylic acid. Because in DMSO, the OH of an acid is usually around 10-12 ppm and broad.

Then, 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H). That looks like a para-substituted benzene. Because in para substitution, the two protons are equivalent and each is a doublet. So the aromatic region suggests a para-substituted benzene ring.

The next signals are 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), 0.9 ppm (t, 3H). Hmm. Let me think about possible structures. The triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H) is probably a methyl group attached to a CH2, like in an ethyl chain. The doublet at 1.4 ppm (3H) suggests a methyl adjacent to a CH, maybe a branch. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be another CH2 group. And 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) – perhaps a CH that's connected to another group, maybe a branching point.

Putting this together, perhaps the substituent on the benzene is a group with a carbonyl, like a carboxylic acid attached to some alkyl chain. Let's think about the structure.

So, the benzene ring has a substituent that's an alkyl chain leading to a carbonyl group. The NMR shows an -OH at 10.5, which points towards a carboxylic acid. So perhaps the substituent is a propanoic acid group. Let me think: propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH, but the substituent might be more complex.

Wait, let me consider the possible substitution. The aromatic protons are at 8.0 and 7.2 ppm as doublets. So, for example, if the substituent is an ethyl group in the para position, the ring would have two sets of doublets. But that's not the case because the substituent is more complex.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propanoate group or a propanoic acid. Let's look at the NMR shifts. The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) is a CH. The 1.7 ppm (m,2H) are two CH2 groups. The 1.4 ppm (d,3H) is a methyl attached to a CH. So maybe it's a branching point, like a isopropyl group, but wait, the 0.9 ppm (t,3H) is a CH3 at the end of a chain.

Wait, maybe it's a butyl group. Let me think. The 0.9 ppm is a triplet, which suggests it's connected to a CH2. The 1.7 ppm is two H, perhaps a CH2 next to a branching point. The 1.4 ppm is a doublet, so maybe attached to a CH. So perhaps a chain like CH2CH(CH2CH3)COOH? Not sure.

Wait, looking at the NMR shifts again: 10.5 ppm (OH), so it's a carboxylic acid. The 1.4 ppm (d,3H) suggests a methyl attached to a CH. And 2.9 ppm (m,1H) could be that CH. Then the 1.7 ppm (m,2H) could be adjacent to that CH, perhaps a CH2 group. Then the 0.9 ppm (t,3H) is a terminal CH3.

Putting this together, maybe it's an isobutyl group attached to the benzene and then a carboxylic acid. Hmm. Wait, if the substituent is a propionic acid with an isobutyl group?

Wait, perhaps the structure is 4-(something)benzoic acid. Let's think. Benzoic acid has the structure PhCOOH. If the substituent is on the para position, it might be something like a branched alkyl group.

Wait, the substituent's NMR: the 2.9 (CH), 1.7 (CH2), 1.4 (CH3 attached to CH), 0.9 (CH2CH2CH3 maybe). So the substituent is a three-carbon chain with a branch, perhaps a pentyl group or a butyl group. Wait, no, let me think of the substituent as a CH2CH(CH2CH3)COOH? No, that doesn't fit the signals.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group attached to a methyl. Wait, maybe it's a -CH(CH2CH3)CH2COOH? Or, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH2CH3)COOH. Hmm, I'm a bit confused.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a sec-butyl group. Let me think. A sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH2CH3)-. Wait, but how does that fit into the NMR?

Wait, let's think about the substituent as a substituent on the benzene ring. The substituent is a propyl chain that is branched, perhaps. Let me try to sketch a possible structure.

If the substituent is CH2CH(CH2CH3)COOH, then the structure would be:

Ph-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-COOH.

But wait, that would make the chain longer. Alternatively, if it's a propyl chain with a branch, perhaps it's like:

Ph-COOH with an ethyl group attached, but that may not fit the NMR.

Wait, maybe I should consider the substituent as a propionyl group with an isobutyl substituent. Or perhaps the substituent is a pentyl group, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group attached to the benzene, followed by a COOH group.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group. Let me think about the substituent as a 4-(sec-butyl) group attached to the benzene ring, but that would be a substituent without a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but the NMR has a peak at 10.5 ppm which is a broad singlet, which is the OH of the carboxylic acid. So the substituent must include a COOH group.

So, putting together, the structure is a benzene ring with a substituent that's a COOH group attached to an alkyl chain. How?

Wait, perhaps the substituent is -(CH2)n-COOH. Let's see. The NMR has the 2.9 ppm (m,1H) which could be the CH adjacent to the carbonyl. For example, in a propanoic acid, the structure would be CH2CH2COOH. But in that case, the protons would be around 2.4 ppm (the CH2 next to COOH). But in our case, the 2.9 ppm is a CH, which is more like a CH attached to the COOH.

So maybe the structure is something like CH(CH2CH2CH3)COOH. Let me think. If the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3)COOH, then the NMR would show the CH group (maybe around 2.9 ppm), and the adjacent CH2 groups. Wait, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a butyl group attached to the benzene ring via a carbonyl. So, 4-(butyl)benzoic acid. But how would the NMR look for that?

Wait, if it's a butyl group, then perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a methyl branch. Let me think: for a substituent like CH2CH(CH2CH3)COOH, the NMR would show:

- COOH group as the broad peak at 10.5.
- The CH2 next to COOH may appear around 2.4-2.5 ppm as a triplet (if it's a CH2 connected to another CH2), but in our data, the 2.9 ppm is a multiplet for 1H. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a isopropyl group attached to the benzene. Wait, but the NMR has a triplet, a doublet, etc., which might fit a longer chain.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to think about the options.

Looking at the options:

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So the structure would be a benzene ring with a COOH group in the para position and a sec-butyl group attached, but wait, that would imply two substituents on the benzene. But the NMR shows only two doublets in the aromatic region, which suggests only one substituent. Oh wait, wait, no. If the substituent is a group that has another substituent, like a substituent with branching.

Wait, in option C, benzene has COOH and a sec-butyl group at para positions. But that would give more than two sets of aromatic protons, perhaps. Let me think: a para-substituted benzene with two substituents (COOH and sec-butyl) would have equivalent protons in the ortho positions, but maybe not. Wait, if benzene has two substituents in the para positions, but that's only possible if they're in the same position, which doesn't make sense. So perhaps the benzene has only one substituent, which is a group that includes a carbonyl.

Oh wait, perhaps the substituent is a propanoic acid group attached to an isobutyl group. Like (isobutyl)propanoic acid.

Wait, perhaps the structure is Ph-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-COOH. Let me think about that.

In that case:

- The aromatic protons would be two doublets, as observed in the NMR, meaning para substitution.

- The substituent is a CH(CH2CH2CH3)COOH group attached to the benzene.

In that case, the NMR would show:

- The COOH proton at 10.5.

- The aromatic protons as two doublets.

Then, for the substituent:

- The CH group (from CH(CH2CH2CH3)) would be a triplet or multiplet around 2.9 ppm.

Wait, the CH2 groups adjacent would be split into multiplets.

Wait, let me try to imagine the substituent as:

Ph–CH(CH2CH2CH3)–COOH.

So, the CH is attached to the benzene, and has a CH2CH2CH3 group on one side and a COOH on the other.

So, the CH would have two substituents: a CH2CH2CH3 and a COOH. Wait, but that's not possible because the valence would be exceeded. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is Ph–CH2–CH(CH2CH3)–COOH.

Wait, that's longer. So let's see:

Ph–CH2–CH(CH2CH3)–COOH.

In this case, the substituent is a three-carbon chain (CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-) attached to the benzene, ending with a COOH group.

So, the NMR would show:

- The COOH proton at 10.5 ppm.

- The aromatic protons: two doublets (para substitution), 8.0 and 7.2 ppm.

For the substituent:

- The CH2 next to the benzene (CH2-) would be split into a triplet or quartet. Wait, but in the NMR data, the 2.9 ppm is a multiplet (1H), which might correspond to a CH group, not a CH2.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is Ph–CH(CH2CH2CH3)–COOH, making the substituent a three-carbon branch.

So, the structure would be:

Ph–CH(CH2CH2CH3)–COOH.

In this case:

- The CH is attached to the benzene, the COOH, and a CH2CH2CH3 group.

So, the substituent is a secondary carbon (the CH) attached to three groups: benzene, COOH, and a CH2CH2CH3.

In this scenario, the substituent's protons would be:

- The CH group (attached to benzene and COOH) would have a proton that's a multiplet around 2.9 ppm.

- The CH2CH2CH3 group would have the following NMR signals:

   The CH2 adjacent to the CH would be around 1.7 ppm (since it's next to a CH group, perhaps as a triplet or multiplet).

   The CH2 next to that would be around 1.4 ppm (maybe a triplet for the CH2 group attached to CH2CH2CH3).

   The terminal CH3 would be at 0.9 ppm as a triplet.

Wait, but the NMR data shows:

- 2.9 (m,1H)

- 1.7 (m,2H)

- 1.4 (d,3H)

- 0.9 (t,3H)

So, the 1.4 ppm (d,3H) is a methyl group attached to a CH. So perhaps the structure is CH(CH3)CH2CH2COOH? No, that wouldn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a sec-butyl group attached to the COOH group. So, the substituent is CH2CH(CH2CH3)COOH, but that doesn't seem to fit.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a propyl group with a methyl branch. Let's think of the substituent as CH(CH2CH2CH3)COOH attached to the benzene.

So, the substituent is:

Ph–CH(CH2CH2CH3)–COOH.

In this case, the CH group is between the benzene and the COOH.

The NMR would then show:

- The COOH proton at 10.5 ppm.

- The aromatic protons as two doublets (para substitution).

For the substituent:

- The CH (at 2.9 ppm) would be a multiplet, integrating for 1H.

- The CH2 groups connected to the CH would have shifts.

The CH2CH2CH3 would be:

   The CH2 next to the CH (i.e., the middle CH2) would be around 1.7 ppm, maybe as a quartet or multiplet.

   The terminal CH3 would be at 0.9 ppm as a triplet.

Wait, but in the data, there's a 1.4 ppm (d,3H), which is a doublet for a methyl group. So perhaps that's a methyl attached to a CH, which is attached to another CH2.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a butyl group. Let me think again. For example, the substituent could be a pentyl group, but that's getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH3)COOH group. So, the structure would be Ph–CH2–CH(CH3)–COOH.

In this case:

The substituent has a CH(CH3) group attached to a CH2, which is attached to the benzene.

So, the NMR would show:

- The CH(CH3) group: the CH would be around 2.9 ppm (m,1H).

- The CH2 next to the benzene (CH2–) would be around 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), since it's adjacent to the CH.

- The methyl group (CH3) attached to the CH would be at 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), since it's a CH3 attached to a CH.

- The terminal CH3 (from the ethyl group?) would be at 0.9 ppm (t,3H), but wait, in this structure, the CH2 after the substituent is only connected to the CH(CH3), so maybe that's not correct.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is Ph–CH(CH2CH2CH3)–COOH.

In that case:

The CH would have a methyl group and a CH2CH2CH3 group attached. So, the substituent is a propyl group with a branch.

The NMR would have:

- The CH (1H) at 2.9 ppm.

- The adjacent CH2 (from CH2CH2CH3) would be around 1.7 ppm (2H), as a quartet or multiplet.

- The next CH2 would be around 1.4 ppm (3H as a triplet?), but wait, 1.4 ppm is a doublet for 3H, which suggests a methyl group attached to a CH. So perhaps that's the methyl attached to the CH.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is Ph–CH(CH2CH2CH3)–COOH.

So, the substituent is:

Ph–CH–(CH2CH2CH3)–COOH.

So, the CH has two groups: benzene and COOH, and a CH2CH2CH3 group.

In that case, the CH is at 2.9 ppm.

The CH2CH2CH3 would be:

The middle CH2 would be around 1.7 ppm (2H), and the terminal CH3 would be at 0.9 ppm (3H, t).

But where does the 1.4 ppm (d,3H) come from? Because that would indicate a CH3 attached to a CH.

Wait, maybe the substituent is Ph–CH(CH2CH2CH2–something)–COOH. I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a methyl branch, leading to a -CH(CH2CH3)CH2COOH group. But I'm not sure.

Wait, let's think of the substituent as a -CH2CH(CH3)CH2COOH group. Then, the structure would be:

Ph–CH2–CH(CH3)–CH2–COOH.

But that would be a longer chain, and I'm not sure if the NMR would match.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH2CH(CH3)COOH group. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: the IR shows a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl (C=O). That's consistent with a carboxylic acid (which also shows a broad O-H stretch around 3400 cm-1), so the compound is likely a benzoic acid derivative.

Looking at the options:

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, which would have a COOH group and a sec-butyl group in the para position. But that would require two substituents on the benzene ring, which would lead to more complex aromatic NMR signals. The aromatic region in the NMR shows only two doublets, which suggests a single substituent in the para position. So perhaps that's not correct.

Wait, but wait: if the substituent is a group that includes a benzene ring itself, but that's probably not the case here.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a COOH group attached to a butyl group. So, the substituent is a butyl group attached to the benzene, and the butyl group has a COOH at one end. Wait, but that would be a longer chain. Let me think: perhaps the substituent is a pentyl group with a COOH at the end.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group, but let's think again.

Looking at the options again:

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So the structure would be:

Benzene ring with a COOH group and a sec-butyl group at para positions. But that would require two substituents on the ring. However, the NMR shows only two doublets, which suggests a single substituent. Therefore, perhaps the substituent is a group that itself has a branch, and the benzene has only one substituent.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a -CH2COOH group attached to an isobutyl group. Let's think: the substituent is an isobutyl group with a propionic acid group attached.

Wait, but the structure would be Ph–CH2–COOH, but that's not matching the NMR.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH2CH3)COOH group.

Wait, the NMR data for the substituent:

- 2.9 ppm (m,1H): probably the CH group.

- 1.7 ppm (m,2H): the adjacent CH2.

- 1.4 ppm (d,3H): the methyl attached to CH.

- 0.9 ppm (t,3H): the terminal CH3.

So, the substituent must have a structure where a CH is connected to a CH2, which is connected to a CH2CH3.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3)COOH group. So, the structure is:

Ph–CH(CH2CH2CH3)–COOH.

In that case, the substituent is a branching point at the CH attached to the benzene and the COOH group, and the CH2CH2CH3 group.

So, the substituent is:

Ph–CH(CH2CH2CH3)–COOH.

In this structure, the CH would have 1H, the adjacent CH2 from CH2CH2CH3 would have 2H, and the terminal CH3 would have 3H as a triplet.

Wait, but then the NMR would show:

- The CH (1H) at 2.9 ppm.

- The adjacent CH2 (from CH2CH2CH3) would be around 1.7 ppm (2H), perhaps as a quartet or multiplet.

- The next CH2 (from CH2CH2CH3) would be around 1.4 ppm? That doesn't fit because the 1.4 ppm is a doublet for 3H, which would be a methyl attached to a CH. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH3)CH2COOH group. But that would be a different structure.

Another thought: perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3)COOH group. So, the substituent would have:

Ph–CH(CH2CH2CH3)–COOH.

In this case, the CH has a CH2CH2CH3 and a COOH group attached. The CH2CH2CH3 group would give:

- The CH2 next to the CH would be at 1.7 ppm (2H).

- The next CH2 would be at 1.4 ppm (3H, as a doublet?), but that doesn't match because 1.4 is a doublet for 3H, which suggests a methyl attached to a CH.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH3)CH2COOH group. So, the substituent is:

Ph–CH(CH3)–CH2–COOH.

In this case, the substituent has a CH(CH3) group attached to a CH2COOH.

The NMR would then show:

- The CH(CH3) group: the CH would be at 2.9 ppm (1H).

- The CH3 attached to CH would be at 1.4 ppm (d, 3H).

- The CH2 between CH(CH3) and COOH would be at 1.7 ppm (m, 2H).

- The terminal CH3 (from the ethyl group?) would be at 0.9 ppm (t, 3H). Wait, but in this structure, the CH2 would be between CH(CH3) and COOH, but I don't see an ethyl group here. Maybe I'm mixing something up.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3)COOH group. So, the substituent is:

Ph–CH(CH2CH2CH3)–COOH.

In this case, the substituent has a CH connected to a CH2CH2CH3 and a COOH group.

So, the substituent's structure would be:

Ph–CH(CH2CH2CH3)–COOH.

Then, the NMR would be:

- COOH proton: 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H).

- Aromatic protons: two doublets, as observed.

- The CH group (1H) at 2.9 ppm (m).

- The adjacent CH2 group (from CH2CH2CH3) would be a quartet around 1.7 ppm (2H).

- The next CH2 would be a triplet around 1.4 ppm (3H?), but wait, 1.4 is a doublet for 3H, which would be a methyl attached to a CH. So perhaps that's not matching.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH2–something) group, but I'm getting a bit tangled up.

Wait, let's take a step back. The substituent's NMR includes a 1.4 ppm (d,3H), which is a methyl group attached to a CH. So, the substituent must have a CH group with a methyl attached. So, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH3)– group attached to something else.

Putting it all together, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH3)–CH2–COOH group. So the structure is Ph–CH(CH3)–CH2–COOH.

In this case, the substituent is a propane chain with a methyl branch at the first carbon.

So, the substituent is:

Ph–CH(CH3)–CH2–COOH.

Let's check the NMR:

- The COOH proton: 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H).

- Aromatic protons: two doublets, 8.0 and 7.2 ppm, which makes sense for a para-substituted benzene.

For the substituent:

- The CH(CH3) group: the CH would be at 2.9 ppm (m,1H).

- The adjacent CH2 group would be at 1.7 ppm (m,2H).

- The CH3 attached to the CH would be at 1.4 ppm (d,3H).

- The terminal CH3 from the CH2 group would be at 0.9 ppm (t,3H). Wait, but in this structure, the CH2 is between CH(CH3) and COOH, so there wouldn't be a terminal CH3. Hmm, that's a problem.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is Ph–CH(CH2CH2CH3)–COOH. Then, the substituent's structure would be:

Ph–CH(CH2CH2CH3)–COOH.

In this case, the substituent has a CH group attached to a benzene and a COOH, and a CH2CH2CH3 group.

So, the substituent's NMR would show:

- The CH (1H) at 2.9 ppm.

- The CH2 next to the CH (from CH2CH2CH3) would be at 1.7 ppm (2H).

- The next CH2 would be at 1.4 ppm (3H, but that's not possible because it's a CH2 group, which has two H). Wait, perhaps I'm missing something here.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a pentyl group with a branch, but I'm not certain.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a propyl group with a methyl branch at the second carbon. So the substituent would be:

Ph–CH2–CH(CH3)–COOH.

In this case:

The substituent is Ph–CH2–CH(CH3)–COOH.

The NMR would then show:

- The COOH proton at 10.5 ppm.

- The aromatic doublets.

- The CH(CH3) group: the CH would be at 2.9 ppm (1H, multiplet).

- The adjacent CH2 (from Ph–CH2–) would be at 1.7 ppm (2H, multiplet).

- The CH3 attached to CH would be at 1.4 ppm (3H, doublet).

- The terminal CH3 from the ethyl group (but in this structure, there isn't one; the substituent ends with COOH). Hmm, that doesn't fit because the NMR has a triplet at 0.9 ppm, which would require a terminal CH3.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is Ph–CH(CH2CH2CH3)–COOH.

In that structure, the substituent has a CH connected to a CH2CH2CH3 and a COOH group. So, the substituent is:

Ph–CH(CH2CH2CH3)–COOH.

In this case, the substituent's NMR would show:

- The CH (1H) at 2.9 ppm.

- The adjacent CH2 (from CH2CH2CH3) at 1.7 ppm (2H).

- The next CH2 (from CH2CH2CH3) at 1.4 ppm (3H, but that's a CH2 group, which has two H, so maybe it's a triplet or quartet. But in the data, it's a doublet, so perhaps not.)

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a methyl branch, leading to a structure like Ph–CH(CH2CH2CH3)–COOH.

Wait, but I'm not getting a perfect match with the NMR data. Let me think of the substituent as a pentyl group but that's probably too long.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a butyl group. If the substituent is a 4-(sec-butyl) group, but that doesn't include a COOH. Wait, looking back at the options, option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, which would have a COOH group and a sec-butyl group in the para position.

But then, the aromatic region would have more complex splitting because of two substituents. However, in the NMR data, the aromatic protons are two doublets, which suggests a single substituent (so, perhaps the substituent itself has another substituent, but that complicates things).

Wait, another approach: perhaps the substituent is a CH2CH(CH2CH3)COOH group. So, the structure is Ph–CH2–CH(CH2CH3)–COOH.

In this case:

- The substituent is a propyl chain with a branch at the second carbon.

The NMR would show:

- COOH proton: 10.5 ppm.

- Aromatic protons: two doublets.

- The CH(CH2CH3) group: the CH would be at 2.9 ppm (1H).

- The adjacent CH2 (from Ph–CH2–) would be at 1.7 ppm (2H).

- The CH2 from the CH(CH2CH3) would be at 1.4 ppm (3H, but that's a CH2, which has two H, so maybe a triplet or quartet. Not matching the 1.4 ppm as a doublet.)

Wait, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Let's try to count the substituent's carbons.

The substituent has:

- The COOH group (1 carbon).

- The CH at 2.9 ppm (another carbon).

- The adjacent CH2 at 1.7 ppm (another carbon).

- The CH3 at 1.4 ppm (another carbon).

- The terminal CH3 at 0.9 ppm (another carbon).

So, that's 5 carbons in the substituent (excluding the benzene ring). So perhaps the substituent is a pentyl group with a branch, leading to a structure like Ph–CH(CH2CH2CH2–something)–COOH. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a butyl group attached to the benzene and a COOH group, but that would require more carbons.

Wait, another thought: the substituent is a propyl group with a methyl branch, making it a isobutyl group. But how?

Wait, if the substituent is a 4-(isobutyl) group attached to the benzene, then the structure would be Ph–CH2–C(CH3)2–COOH. But that might not fit the NMR data.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a 4-(tert-butyl) group, but that would have a different NMR.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a 4-(pentyl) group with a branch, but I'm getting stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a 4-(ethyl) group attached to the benzene, but that doesn't explain the NMR.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a 4-(propyl) group with a methyl branch. So, the substituent is Ph–CH(CH2CH2CH3)–COOH.

Hmm, but I'm not getting a perfect fit.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a 4-(sec-butyl) group attached to the benzene, and the COOH is part of that group. So, the structure is:

Ph–CH2–CH(CH2CH3)–COOH.

In this case, the substituent is a butyl group with a branch.

The NMR would then show:

- The COOH proton: 10.5 ppm.

- The aromatic protons: two doublets.

For the substituent:

- The CH(CH2CH3) group: the CH would be at 2.9 ppm (1H).

- The adjacent CH2 (from Ph–CH2–) would be at 1.7 ppm (2H).

- The CH2 from the CH(CH2CH3) would be at 1.4 ppm (3H, but that's a CH2 group, which doesn't fit. So maybe this isn't right.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a 4-(butyl) group with a methyl attached to the CH. But I'm not making progress.

Let me think about the reaction part. The compound reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I remember that this is a reaction that converts ketones to alcohols, but wait, more accurately, it's the Clemmensen reduction, which reduces ketones to alkanes. Wait, no, Clemmensen uses Zn(Hg)/HCl, and red phosphorus with HI is another reaction. Oh wait, red phosphorus and HI is used for the hydrolysis of nitriles to amines, but perhaps more importantly, maybe it's for the deoxygenation of ketones or aldehydes to alkanes. Alternatively, perhaps it's the reduction of a carbonyl group.

Wait, the reaction with red phosphorus and HI is known as the von Braun degradation, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's the reduction of a carbonyl group to a methylene group. Wait, wait, I'm a bit rusty on this. Let me think: red phosphorus and HI can be used to reduce carbonyl groups. For example, a ketone would be reduced to an alcohol, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the hydrolysis of a nitrile, but in this case, the starting material doesn't seem to be a nitrile.

Wait, the starting compound is a carboxylic acid, as indicated by the IR and NMR. So, when a carboxylic acid reacts with red phosphorus and HI, what happens? I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the reduction of the carboxylic acid to an alcohol, but that doesn't seem right because carboxylic acids are generally not reduced under those conditions. Alternatively, maybe it's the conversion of the carboxylic acid into an acid chloride, but that's not likely with red phosphorus and HI.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is more about the substituent. If the substituent is a secondary or tertiary alcohol, but in this case, the substituent is a carboxylic acid.

Wait, another thought: maybe the reaction is the removal of the functional group. For example, if the substituent is a ketone, it could be reduced to an alcohol. But in this case, the substituent is a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction converts the carboxylic acid into an alcohol, but I'm not sure how.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck on the reaction part. Let me think again. The IR shows a strong C=O around 1720, which is a carboxylic acid. So the starting material is a benzoic acid derivative.

When benzoic acid undergoes a reaction with red phosphorus and HI, perhaps it's a substitution reaction. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is the formation of an acid chloride, but I don't think red phosphorus and HI are used for that.

Wait, another thought: HI is a strong acid and can act as a nucleophile. Red phosphorus may help in some elimination or addition reactions. Alternatively, perhaps it's a halogenation reaction. But I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the reduction of the carboxylic acid. But carboxylic acids are not typically reduced under such conditions. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is the preparation of an acid bromide, but that usually involves an anhydride and a bromide.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the conversion of the carboxylic acid into an alkyl iodide. Wait, but how?

Wait, another approach: looking at the options, all except option B are benzoic acid derivatives. Option B is 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene, which is a substituted toluene.

So, if the starting material is a benzoic acid, and the reaction converts the COOH group into a CH2 group, perhaps via reduction. Wait, but how would that happen?

Wait, Clemmensen reduction reduces ketones to alkanes, but the starting material is a carboxylic acid, which is not a ketone. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the reduction of the carboxylic acid to a CH2 group. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the removal of the oxygen. For example, if the starting compound is a benzoic acid with an adjacent group that can be deoxygenated.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the reaction is the formation of an alcohol. If the substituent has a carbonyl group, maybe it's reduced. But the substituent in the starting material is a carboxylic acid.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to think of the reaction in terms of the options.

The options are:

A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid → still has COOH.

B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene → no COOH, just a substituted toluene.

C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid → still has COOH.

D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene → also a substituted toluene.

So, the reaction with red phosphorus and HI must be converting the starting material into one of these options. The starting material is a benzoic acid, so options A and C have the same functional group, but the substituent differs.

If the reaction removes the COOH group, then the product would be a substituted toluene (like options B or D), but I'm not sure how that would happen.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the COOH group is replaced by an alkyl group. But I don't know the exact mechanism for that.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the reduction of the COOH group to a CH2 group, effectively removing the oxygen.

For example, if the starting material is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C), and it's reduced, perhaps the COOH is converted into a CH2 group, leading to 4-(sec-butyl)toluene, which is option D.

Wait, but option D is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. That's a 1,4-dimethyl substitution with a sec-butyl group, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction converts the COOH group into a methyl group. So, 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid would become 4-(sec-butyl)toluene, which would be 4-isobutyl toluene, but that's not exactly an option. Wait, option D is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene, which would be a para-xylene with a sec-butyl group. So perhaps that's the product.

But wait, the starting material's NMR has a COOH group. So after reaction, it would lose the COOH and gain a CH2 or CH3 group.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a decarboxylation, but with what reagent? Decarboxylation typically requires heat and sometimes a base or acid catalyst, but not sure about red phosphorus and HI.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the substitution of the COOH group with an iodide, but that doesn't fit any of the options.

Another approach: think about the reaction of a benzoic acid with HI and red phosphorus. Maybe it's a nucleophilic substitution if there's a leaving group. But benzoic acid doesn't have a good leaving group unless it's activated.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the formation of an acyl iodide. Benzoic acid can react with HI to form benzoyl iodide, but I'm not sure if red phosphorus is involved in that.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the reduction of the acid to an alcohol. But again, I'm not sure about the conditions.

Wait, let me think about the options again. The product after reaction has to be one of A, B, C, D. The starting material is a benzoic acid, so options A and C have COOH, while B and D don't. So, if the reaction results in the loss of COOH, the product would be B or D. But how?

Wait, another thought: perhaps the substituent on the benzene is a group that, upon reaction, loses part of its structure. For example, if the substituent is a propyl group attached to the benzene via a carbonyl (like a ketone), it would be reduced to a CH2 group. But in our case, the substituent is a carboxylic acid.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a substitution where the COOH is replaced by a methyl group. So if the starting material is 4-ethylbenzene propanoic acid (option A), perhaps the COOH is replaced by a methyl, leading to 4-ethylbenzene, but that's not one of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the formation of an alkyl iodide. If the COOH is converted into a better leaving group, like a tosylate, and then substituted, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the reaction conditions again. Red phosphorus and HI are used in the hydrolysis of nitriles to amines, but that's when the nitrile is treated with H2O and P. Alternatively, perhaps it's a different reaction.

Wait, another possibility: the reaction is the reduction of a nitrile to an amine, but the starting material doesn't have a nitrile.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the elimination of a molecule. For example, if the substituent is a propyl group with a COOH, maybe the reaction removes the COOH and forms a double bond. But that's speculative.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the reduction of the carbonyl group in the substituent to an alcohol. But the substituent is a carboxylic acid, which would require more than just reduction.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me look at the options again. If the starting material is option C, 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, and it reacts with red phosphorus and HI, perhaps the product is option D, which is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. But how?

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the reduction of the COOH group. For example, the COOH is converted into a CH2 group, making the substituent a CH2 group instead of COOH. So, 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid would become 4-(sec-butyl)toluene, which would be option D if the methyl is in the right position.

Wait, let me structure option D: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. That's para-xylene with a sec-butyl group. So, the benzene has a methyl group in the para position and a sec-butyl group in the ortho position? No, the numbering would have the sec-butyl at position 1 and the methyl at position 4, which are para positions. So it's 4-methyl-1-(sec-butyl)benzene.

So, if the starting material is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C), and the reaction converts the COOH into a methyl group, then the product would be 4-(sec-butyl)toluene, which would be option D.

But how does the reaction achieve that? I'm not entirely sure about the mechanism, but perhaps it's a substitution where the COOH is replaced by a methyl group via some reaction involving HI and red phosphorus.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the formation of a Grignard reagent, but that's not likely under these conditions.

Hmm, putting this all together, I think the starting material is option C, 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, and upon reaction with red phosphorus and HI, it loses the COOH group and gains a methyl, leading to option D, 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.

But wait, I'm not entirely confident about the reaction mechanism, but based on the spectral data and the options, I think that's the most plausible.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves identifying the final product when Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. The spectral data provided for Compound X includes IR and ¹H NMR, which suggest the presence of a carboxylic acid group (broad singlet at 10.5 ppm in the NMR and a strong C=O stretch at 1720 cm⁻¹ in the IR). The aromatic region in the NMR (8.0 ppm and 7.2 ppm as doublets) indicates a para-substituted benzene ring. The remaining NMR signals (2.9 ppm, 1.7 ppm, 1.4 ppm, and 0.9 ppm) correspond to a branched alkyl chain, likely a sec-butyl group.

### Analysis of Compound X
- **IR Data**: The broad O-H stretch (3400–2500 cm⁻¹) and the strong C=O stretch (1720 cm⁻¹) confirm the presence of a carboxylic acid group.
- **¹H NMR Data**:
  - The aromatic protons (8.0 ppm and 7.2 ppm as doublets) suggest a para-substituted benzene ring.
  - The signals at 2.9 ppm (1H, m), 1.7 ppm (2H, m), 1.4 ppm (3H, d), and 0.9 ppm (3H, t) indicate a branched alkyl chain, consistent with a sec-butyl group.

From this analysis, Compound X is identified as **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid** (Option C).

### Reaction with Red Phosphorus and HI
The reaction conditions (red phosphorus and HI) are known to reduce carboxylic acids to alkanes by replacing the carbonyl group with a methylene (-CH₂-) group. In this case, the carboxylic acid group in 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid is reduced to a methyl group, resulting in the formation of **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene** (Option D). This product is a substituted toluene with a sec-butyl group and a methyl group in the para positions.

### Critical Evaluation of Options
- **Option A (2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid)**: This compound retains the carboxylic acid group, which is inconsistent with the reaction conditions that remove the carbonyl group.
- **Option B (1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene)**: This compound lacks the carboxylic acid group and does not match the structure of Compound X.
- **Option C (4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid)**: This is the structure of Compound X but is not the final product after the reaction.
- **Option D (1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene)**: This is the correct product formed after the reduction of the carboxylic acid group in Compound X.

### Conclusion
The starting material, 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (Option C), reacts with red phosphorus and HI to form 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene (Option D) as the final product.
