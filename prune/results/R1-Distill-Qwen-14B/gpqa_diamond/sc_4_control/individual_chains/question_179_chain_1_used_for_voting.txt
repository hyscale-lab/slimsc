Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here about matrices and their properties. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll try to break it down step by step. Let me see... the question gives four matrices W, X, Y, Z, and I have to choose the correct statement among options A to D.

First, I'll recall some quantum mechanics concepts. I remember that in quantum mechanics, observables are represented by Hermitian matrices. Also, the evolution operator is a unitary matrix, right? And for a matrix to represent a quantum state when exponentiated, it might have to be Hermitian as well. Or wait, no, the exponential of an anti-Hermitian matrix is unitary, which is what the time evolution operator is.

Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: There exists a vector to which if one multiplies e^X, the norm of the vector changes.

Hmm. The norm changing after multiplying by a matrix would mean the matrix isn't unitary. Because unitary matrices preserve the norm when acting on vectors. So if e^X is not unitary, then multiplying by it would change the vector's norm.

What about matrix X? Let's compute X's properties. X is given as:
[i, -1, 2i;
1, 0, 1;
2i, -1, -i]

To check if e^X is unitary, I think X would need to be skew-Hermitian because the exponential of a skew-Hermitian matrix is unitary. So is X skew-Hermitian? A skew-Hermitian matrix satisfies X† = -X.

Let me compute X's conjugate transpose (X†).

Original X:
Row 1: i, -1, 2i
Row 2: 1, 0, 1
Row 3: 2i, -1, -i

X† would be the transpose of the conjugate of each element.

Conjugate of X:
Row 1: -i, -1, -2i
Row 2: -1, 0, -1
Row 3: -2i, -1, i

Then transpose (switch rows and columns):
So columns become rows.

X† would be:
Row 1: -i, -1, -2i
Row 2: -1, 0, -1
Row 3: -2i, -1, i

Wait, wait. Let me double-check. For X†, each element (i,j) is the conjugate of (j,i) in X.

So element (1,1) in X is i → (1,1) in X† is -i.
(1,2) in X is -1 → (2,1) in X† is -1.
(1,3) in X is 2i → (3,1) in X† is -2i.

Similarly, (2,1) in X is 1 → (1,2) in X† is 1? Wait, no. Wait, wait, let's get this right.

Wait, matrix X is:

Row 1: i, -1, 2i
Row 2: 1, 0, 1
Row 3: 2i, -1, -i

So X† (conjugate transpose) will have:

Element (1,1) = i* → -i
Element (1,2) = -1 → (2,1) is -1
Element (1,3) = 2i → (3,1) is -2i
Element (2,2) = 0 → 0
Element (2,3) = 1 → (3,2) is 1
Element (3,3) = (-i)* → i

Wait, no, that's not right. Let me construct X† properly.

Constructing X†:

The (i,j) element is the complex conjugate of X[j,i].

So for each element in X, (i,j) becomes (j,i) in X†, and we take the complex conjugate.

So for X:

X[1,1] = i → X†[1,1] = -i
X[1,2] = -1 → X†[2,1] = -1
X[1,3] = 2i → X†[3,1] = -2i
X[2,1] = 1 → X†[1,2] = 1
X[2,2] = 0 → X†[2,2] = 0
X[2,3] = 1 → X†[3,2] = 1
X[3,1] = 2i → X†[1,3] = -2i
X[3,2] = -1 → X†[2,3] = -1
X[3,3] = -i → X†[3,3] = i

So X† would be:
Row 1: -i, 1, -2i
Row 2: -1, 0, -1
Row 3: -2i, 1, i

Now, what's -X?

X is:
Row 1: i, -1, 2i
Row 2: 1, 0, 1
Row 3: 2i, -1, -i

So -X would be:
Row 1: -i, 1, -2i
Row 2: -1, 0, -1
Row 3: -2i, 1, i

Wait, that's exactly the same as X†. So X† equals -X. Therefore, X is skew-Hermitian. Because for a skew-Hermitian matrix, X† = -X.

Oh, right! So if X is skew-Hermitian, then e^X is unitary. Because the exponential of a skew-Hermitian matrix is unitary. So if you have a unitary matrix U, then U*v has the same norm as v. So e^X is unitary, meaning multiplying any vector by e^X won't change its norm. So option A says that there's a vector where the norm changes, but since e^X is unitary, this can't happen. So option A is incorrect.

Option B: (e^X)*Y*(e^{-X}) represents a quantum state.

Wait, a quantum state is represented by a density matrix, which is positive semi-definite and has trace 1. Also, for it to be a valid state, it must be Hermitian.

But Y is given as:

Y = [
[0.5, 0.1, 0.2],
[0.1, 0.25, 0.1],
[0.2, 0.1, 0.25]
]

Is Y Hermitian? Let's check. Because Y is real and symmetric (since Y[i,j] = Y[j,i]), so yes, Y is Hermitian.

Now, e^X is unitary, as we saw. So e^{-X} is the inverse of e^X, since for unitary matrices U, U^{-1} = U†, and since X is skew-Hermitian, e^{-X} is the inverse of e^X.

So e^X Y e^{-X} is a similarity transformation. Similarity transformations of Hermitian matrices result in Hermitian matrices. So (e^X Y e^{-X}) is Hermitian.

But is it a valid density matrix? A density matrix must be positive semi-definite and have trace 1. So let's see.

The trace of Y is 0.5 + 0.25 + 0.25 = 1. So the trace of e^X Y e^{-X} would be the same as trace(Y), since trace(ABC) = trace(BCA), and if A and C are unitary, the trace remains same. So trace is 1.

But is e^X Y e^{-X} positive semi-definite? Well, unitary transformations preserve eigenvalues, except for the signs? Wait, no. Because e^X is unitary, the similarity transformation would not change the eigenvalues of Y. Since Y is positive semi-definite (all eigenvalues positive?), then the transformed matrix would also be positive semi-definite. So it's a density matrix. So option B is correct.

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, if Y is a density matrix, then so would any conjugated version by a unitary. So yes, e^X Y e^{-X} is a valid quantum state. So option B could be correct.

Hmm, but let me not jump to conclusions yet because I need to check all options.

Option C: Z and X represent observables.

Observables are Hermitian. So are Z and X Hermitian?

Let me check X first. Earlier, I found that X is skew-Hermitian, which implies that X† = -X. So X is not Hermitian, because for Hermitian, X† = X. So since X is skew-Hermitian, it's not Hermitian. So X can't represent an observable.

What about Z? Let's check if Z is Hermitian.

Z is given as:

Row 1: 3, 2i, 5
Row 2: -2i, -2, -4i
Row 3: 5, 4i, 4

So Z in matrix form:

[3, 2i, 5]
[-2i, -2, -4i]
[5, 4i, 4]

Compute Z†, its conjugate transpose.

Take each element's complex conjugate and transpose.

Conjugate:

Row 1: 3 → 3, 2i → -2i, 5 →5
Row 2: -2i → 2i, -2 →-2, -4i →4i
Row3: 5→5,4i→-4i,4→4

Transpose the matrix:

Original Z after conjugation:

3, -2i,5
2i, -2,4i
5, -4i,4

Wait, no. Let me be precise.

Conjugate of Z:
Row 1: 3, -2i,5
Row 2: 2i, -2,4i
Row 3:5, -4i,4

Then transpose to get Z†:

Columns become rows.

Row1: 3, 2i,5 → from Z's first column
Row2: -2i, -2,4i → from Z's second column
Row3:5,4i,4 → from Z's third column

So Z† is:

3, 2i,5
-2i, -2,4i
5,4i,4

Now, compare Z and Z†.

Z is:

3, 2i,5
-2i, -2, -4i
5,4i,4

Wait, Z's second row third element is -4i, but in Z†, second row third element is 4i. So Z† is:

Row1:3, 2i,5
Row2:-2i, -2,4i
Row3:5,4i,4

Compare with Z:

Row1:3,2i,5 → same as Z† row1.

Row2: -2i, -2, -4i → in Z†, row2 is -2i, -2,4i. So Z's row2, column3 is -4i, but Z† has 4i.

So Z is not equal to Z†. Therefore, Z is not Hermitian. So neither Z nor X are Hermitian. Thus, they can't be observables. So option C is incorrect.

Option D: W and X represent the evolution operator of some quantum system.

The evolution operator is a unitary matrix. So are W and X unitary?

Check W first. W is:

0 0 1
0 1 0
1 0 0

Is W unitary? For a matrix to be unitary, W*W† = I.

Compute W†, which is the conjugate transpose of W. Since W is real and symmetric, W† = W^T.

W's transpose is:

0 0 1
0 1 0
1 0 0

Wait, W is symmetric? Let me see:

Original W:
Row1: 0,0,1
Row2:0,1,0
Row3:1,0,0

Actually, W is symmetric because W[i,j] = W[j,i]. So W^T = W. So W is real and symmetric, so W† = W.

Compute W*W† = W^2.

W squared:

W is:
[0 0 1]
[0 1 0]
[1 0 0]

Compute W^2:

Element (1,1): (0*0 + 0*0 + 1*1) =1?
Wait, no. Matrix multiplication is row times column.

Wait, W^2 is W multiplied by W.

So W * W:

First row of W: [0,0,1]
Multiply by each column of W.

Column 1: 0*0 + 0*0 + 1*1 =1
Column 2: 0*0 +0*1 +1*0=0
Column3:0*1 +0*0 +1*0=0
So first row of W^2 is [1,0,0].

Second row of W is [0,1,0].

Multiply by columns of W:

Column1: 0*0 +1*0 +0*1=0
Column2: 0*0 +1*1 +0*0=1
Column3:0*1 +1*0 +0*0=0
So second row is [0,1,0].

Third row of W is [1,0,0].

Multiply by columns:

Column1:1*0 +0*0 +0*1=0
Column2:1*0 +0*1 +0*0=0
Column3:1*1 +0*0 +0*0=1
So third row is [0,0,1].

So W^2 is:

1 0 0
0 1 0
0 0 1

Which is the identity matrix. So W^2 = I → W is unitary. Because W*W† = I, which is the condition for a unitary matrix.

So W is unitary. Now, what about X?

X is skew-Hermitian, as we saw earlier. The exponential of X is unitary, but X itself is not unitary. Because unitary matrices have their inverse equal to their conjugate transpose. Let's check if X is unitary.

Compute X* X† and see if it's identity.

X is:
[i, -1, 2i]
[1, 0, 1]
[2i, -1, -i]

Earlier, we found X† is:
[-i, 1, -2i]
[-1, 0, -1]
[-2i, 1, i]

Wait, no, wait. Previously, I think I made a mistake in computing X†. Let me recompute X†.

Wait, X is:

Row1: i, -1, 2i
Row2:1, 0, 1
Row3:2i, -1, -i

So X† is the conjugate transpose. So each element (j,i) is the conjugate of X[i,j].

Compute X†:

Element (1,1): i* → -i
(1,2): X[1,2] is -1 → conjugate is -1. So (2,1) is -1.
(1,3): X[1,3] is 2i → conjugate is -2i. So (3,1) is -2i.
(2,1): X[2,1] is 1 → (1,2) is 1.
(2,2): 0 → 0.
(2,3): X[2,3] is 1 → (3,2) is 1.
(3,1): X[3,1] is 2i → (1,3) is -2i.
(3,2): X[3,2] is -1 → (2,3) is -1.
(3,3): X[3,3] is -i → (3,3) is i.

So X† is:

Row1: -i, 1, -2i
Row2: -1, 0, -1
Row3: -2i, 1, i

Now, compute X * X†.

Let me compute the product.

First row of X multiplied by each column of X†.

Row1 of X: [i, -1, 2i]

Multiply by column1 of X†: [-i, -1, -2i]^T.

i*(-i) + (-1)*(-1) + 2i*(-2i)
= (i*(-i) is 1) + (1) + (2i*(-2i) is -4i² → since i²=-1, that's 4)
So 1 +1 +4 =6.

Hmm, but wait, the (1,1) element is 6? That's not 1. So X*X† is not the identity matrix. Thus, X is not unitary.

So X is not a unitary matrix. Therefore, option D is incorrect because X isn't unitary, so it can't represent the evolution operator.

Wait, but wait. The evolution operator is usually of the form e^(-iHt/ħ), where H is Hermitian. So the exponent is anti-Hermitian, making the exponential unitary.

So the evolution operator is unitary, so W is unitary, but X isn't. So option D says W and X are evolution operators. But since X isn't unitary, D is incorrect.

So going back to the options:

Option A: Incorrect because e^X is unitary, so norm doesn't change.

Option B: Correct, because e^X Y e^{-X} is a valid density matrix.

Option C: Incorrect, as neither Z nor X are Hermitian.

Option D: Incorrect, as X isn't unitary.

So the correct statement is option B.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To analyze the given matrices and determine the correct statement, we evaluate each option based on the properties of the matrices provided:

### Option A:
The statement claims that there exists a vector for which the norm changes when multiplied by \( e^X \). For the norm to remain unchanged, \( e^X \) must be unitary. A matrix \( e^X \) is unitary if \( X \) is skew-Hermitian, meaning \( X^\dagger = -X \). 

Matrix \( X \) is given as:
\[
X = \begin{pmatrix}
i & -1 & 2i \\
1 & 0 & 1 \\
2i & -1 & -i
\end{pmatrix}.
\]
Computing \( X^\dagger \) (the conjugate transpose of \( X \)) and verifying \( X^\dagger = -X \), we confirm that \( X \) is skew-Hermitian. Since \( X \) is skew-Hermitian, \( e^X \) is unitary, and multiplying any vector by \( e^X \) preserves the norm. Therefore, **Option A is incorrect**.

---

### Option B:
The statement claims that \( e^X Y e^{-X} \) represents a quantum state. A quantum state is represented by a density matrix, which must be Hermitian, positive semi-definite, and have trace 1.

Matrix \( Y \) is given as:
\[
Y = \begin{pmatrix}
0.5 & 0.1 & 0.2 \\
0.1 & 0.25 & 0.1 \\
0.2 & 0.1 & 0.25
\end{pmatrix}.
\]
Since \( Y \) is real and symmetric, it is Hermitian. The trace of \( Y \) is \( 0.5 + 0.25 + 0.25 = 1 \), so it satisfies the trace condition. 

Next, \( e^X \) is unitary (as \( X \) is skew-Hermitian), and \( e^{-X} \) is its inverse. The similarity transformation \( e^X Y e^{-X} \) preserves the Hermiticity and eigenvalues of \( Y \), ensuring the resulting matrix is also Hermitian and positive semi-definite. Thus, \( e^X Y e^{-X} \) is a valid quantum state. **Option B is correct**.

---

### Option C:
The statement claims that \( Z \) and \( X \) represent observables. Observables in quantum mechanics are represented by Hermitian matrices. 

For \( X \), we already established that it is skew-Hermitian (\( X^\dagger = -X \)), not Hermitian (\( X^\dagger \neq X \)), so \( X \) is not an observable.

For \( Z \), we compute \( Z^\dagger \) (the conjugate transpose of \( Z \)) and compare it to \( Z \). Matrix \( Z \) is given as:
\[
Z = \begin{pmatrix}
3 & 2i & 5 \\
-2i & -2 & -4i \\
5 & 4i & 4
\end{pmatrix}.
\]
The conjugate transpose \( Z^\dagger \) is:
\[
Z^\dagger = \begin{pmatrix}
3 & -2i & 5 \\
2i & -2 & 4i \\
5 & -4i & 4
\end{pmatrix}.
\]
Clearly, \( Z^\dagger \neq Z \), so \( Z \) is not Hermitian. Therefore, neither \( Z \) nor \( X \) are Hermitian, and they cannot represent observables. **Option C is incorrect**.

---

### Option D:
The statement claims that \( W \) and \( X \) represent the evolution operator of some quantum system. The evolution operator in quantum mechanics is a unitary matrix, meaning \( U U^\dagger = I \).

For \( W \), we compute \( W W^\dagger \). Matrix \( W \) is given as:
\[
W = \begin{pmatrix}
0 & 0 & 1 \\
0 & 1 & 0 \\
1 & 0 & 0
\end{pmatrix}.
\]
Since \( W \) is real and symmetric, \( W^\dagger = W^T \). Computing \( W W^\dagger \), we find:
\[
W W^\dagger = \begin{pmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 1 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 1
\end{pmatrix} = I.
\]
Thus, \( W \) is unitary.

For \( X \), we compute \( X X^\dagger \). Using \( X^\dagger = -X \) (since \( X \) is skew-Hermitian), we find:
\[
X X^\dagger = X (-X) = -X^2.
\]
Computing \( X^2 \), we find \( X^2 \neq I \), so \( X X^\dagger \neq I \). Therefore, \( X \) is not unitary. 

Since \( X \) is not unitary, it cannot represent the evolution operator. **Option D is incorrect**.

---

### Final Answer:
The correct statement is **Option B**.  
**Answer: B**
