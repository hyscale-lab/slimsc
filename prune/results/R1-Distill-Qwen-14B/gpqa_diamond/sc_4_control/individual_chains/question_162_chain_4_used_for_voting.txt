Okay, so I've got this question about the area of a pseudosphere with radius r=2, and the metric is given. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

First, I remember that a pseudosphere is a type of surface in hyperbolic geometry, right? It's like a sphere but with negative curvature, so it's got a saddle shape. But I'm not 100% sure about the details. Oh wait, and the metric given here is in 2D, so maybe it's a 2-dimensional surface? Or perhaps it's embedded in some higher-dimensional space? Not too sure, but maybe I don't need that for the area calculation.

The metric provided is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, that's kind of similar to the metric for a sphere, but with a different denominator. For a sphere of radius a, the metric in 2D would usually be something like (a²)/(x² + y²) (dx² + dy²) when using polar coordinates, but that's for a sphere in 3D. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the area element. The area of a surface can be found by integrating the square root of the determinant of the metric tensor over the surface. But wait, in 2D, the area element is sqrt(g) dx dy, where g is the determinant of the metric tensor. So the metric is given in terms of dx² + dy², multiplied by a factor. 

Let me write the metric in matrix form. The metric tensor g_{ij} would have diagonal entries. So if ds² is equal to (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²), that means the (dx, dy) part is scaled by this factor. So the metric tensor is diagonal with each component being 32/(4 - x² - y²). So the determinant would be the product of the diagonal elements since it's diagonal. So determinant g = (32/(4 - x² - y²)) * (32/(4 - x² - y²)) = (32)^2 / (4 - x² - y²)^2.

So the area element dA would be sqrt(det g) dx dy. Wait, but sqrt of the determinant of the metric tensor, right? Because in 2D, the area element in coordinates is sqrt(g) dx dy, where g is the determinant.

So sqrt(det g) = sqrt( (32)^2 / (4 - x² - y²)^2 ) = 32/(4 - x² - y²).

Wait, because 32 is positive and denominator is positive as well (since 4 - x² - y² must be positive for the metric to be defined, I think). So the area element is (32)/(4 - x² - y²) dx dy.

But wait, that's the area element in the coordinates (x, y). Now, I need to figure out what region in x and y I'm integrating over. The denominator 4 - x² - y² implies that x² + y² < 4. So the domain is a disk of radius 2 (since sqrt(4) is 2). So x and y run over all points where x² + y² < 4.

So the area A is the integral over this disk of (32)/(4 - x² - y²) dx dy. Hmm, okay, but integrating that might be tricky. Let me think about a coordinate substitution. Since the domain is a disk, polar coordinates would be better. Let me switch to r and θ, where x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ. Then dx dy = r dr dθ.

So the integral becomes:

A = ∫ (from θ=0 to 2π) ∫ (from r=0 to 2) [32/(4 - r²)] * r dr dθ.

Let me compute the inner integral first, which is the r part. Let me denote the integral over r as I.

I = ∫ (32 r) / (4 - r²) dr from 0 to 2.

Let me make a substitution. Let u = 4 - r². Then du/dr = -2r. So - (du)/2 = r dr.

So when r=0, u=4. When r=2, u=0.

Substituting, I becomes:

I = ∫ (32) * [ - (du)/2 ] / u, integrated from u=4 to u=0.

Wait, flipping the limits to make it from 0 to 4, the negative sign goes away. So,

I = (32/2) ∫ (from u=0 to u=4) (1/u) du.

Which is 16 ∫ (1/u) du from 0 to4.

The integral of 1/u is ln|u|, so evaluating from 0 to4 would be 16 [ln4 - ln0]. But wait, ln0 is negative infinity, so this would be divergent. Wait, but that can't be right. Because if the area is infinite, but the options have an option D which is +infty. So is the area infinite?

Wait, but let me think again about the metric and the region. The metric is defined for x² + y² <4, so r <2. But the area element becomes (32)/(4 - r²) r dr dθ. So as r approaches 2, the denominator approaches zero, making the integrand blow up. So the integral is divergent, which would mean the area is infinite.

So the area of the pseudosphere is infinite? But wait, I thought pseudospheres have finite surface area. Or is this a different type of pseudosphere?

Wait, maybe I'm confusing the terms. I think the metric given is actually that of a sphere with a negative radius squared in the denominator. Let me think about the line element again. If the metric were (32)/(4 -x² - y²) (dx² + dy²), then as x² + y² approaches 4, the line element becomes very large, leading to infinite area.

Wait, I remember that in flat space, like the plane, the area is finite. But in this case, the metric is conformally flat, but the conformal factor is 32/(4 - r²), which diverges at r=2. So the area element becomes infinite as you approach the boundary.

So integrating from r=0 to 2 would give an infinite area. So the area is infinite, which would correspond to option D.

Wait, but the question is about a pseudosphere of radius r=2. I thought the pseudosphere has a finite area, but maybe that's not the case here. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me double-check the integral. The integral I is 16 ∫ (1/u) du from 0 to4. The integral of 1/u from a to b is ln(b/a). So from 0 to4, it's ln(4/0) which is ln(inf), which is infinity. So the area would be infinite.

Therefore, the area is infinite, so option D is correct.

The given metric is 

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left(dx^2 + dy^2\right),
\]

and the task is to compute the area of the pseudosphere of radius \(r = 2\). To calculate the area, we use the area element in a 2D metric, which is \(dA = \sqrt{\det g} \, dx \, dy\), where \(g\) is the determinant of the metric tensor. The metric tensor in this case is diagonal with components \(g_{xx} = g_{yy} = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2}\). The determinant is therefore:

\[
\det g = \left(\frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2}\right)^2.
\]

The area element becomes:

\[
dA = \sqrt{\det g} \, dx \, dy = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \, dx \, dy.
\]

The domain of integration is the region where \(x^2 + y^2 < 4\), which corresponds to a disk of radius 2. Switching to polar coordinates (\(x = r \cos\theta\), \(y = r \sin\theta\)) with \(dx \, dy = r \, dr \, d\theta\), the area integral becomes:

\[
A = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^2 \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \cdot r \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

The angular integral \(\int_0^{2\pi} d\theta = 2\pi\) is straightforward. The radial integral is:

\[
\int_0^2 \frac{32r}{4 - r^2} \, dr.
\]

Using the substitution \(u = 4 - r^2\), \(du = -2r \, dr\), the integral becomes:

\[
\int_0^2 \frac{32r}{4 - r^2} \, dr = 16 \int_0^4 \frac{1}{u} \, du.
\]

The integral of \(\frac{1}{u}\) from \(u = 0\) to \(u = 4\) is \(\ln|u|\), which diverges as \(u \to 0\). This indicates that the area element becomes infinite near the boundary \(r = 2\). Therefore, the total area of the pseudosphere is infinite.

Thus, the correct answer is:
