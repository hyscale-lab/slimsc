Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I'm supposed to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my relativity, but let's try to think this through.

First, the problem says that astronaut A has a mass of 2m and is moving at 0.6c, and astronaut B has a mass of 3m moving at 0.5c, both in the positive x-direction. The options give different values for relative speed and total energy, so I need to calculate both.

Wait, but wait. When the question says relative speed, does it mean the speed of one astronaut as seen from the other's frame of reference? Because relative speed in classical mechanics is just the difference, but with relativity, it's more complicated. Right, I remember that you can't just subtract the speeds in relativity because it violates the speed limit of light.

So for relative velocity, I think I need to use the velocity addition formula from special relativity. The formula is: 

v_rel = (u - v)/(1 - (u*v)/c²)

Wait, wait, no. Wait, astronaut A is moving at u = 0.6c, and astronaut B at v = 0.5c. But wait, are we calculating the speed of B from A's frame, or A from B's frame? The problem says "relative speed", which is symmetric in a way, but the formula depends on which is which.

Wait, actually, if I'm in A's frame, then B is moving at (u' = (v - u)/(1 - (u v)/c² )). So yeah, the relative speed of B as seen from A. Let me plug the numbers in.

So u is 0.6c, v is 0.5c.

So u' = (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/c² )

Simplify numerator: 0.5c - 0.6c = -0.1c. Wait, negative, so the speed would be 0.1c in the opposite direction, but speed is positive, so 0.1c.

Denominator: 1 - (0.3 c² ) / c² = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7.

So u' = (-0.1c) / 0.7 = - (1/7) c ≈ -0.1428c. The negative sign indicates direction, so the speed is 0.1428c, about 0.14c. So the relative speed is about 0.14c. Looking at the options, options C and D have 0.14c as their relative speed. So options A and B are out for v_rel.

Now, the total energy of the system. Hmm, total energy in relativity includes the rest mass energy plus the kinetic energy. But wait, for each astronaut, their total energy is gamma multiplied by their rest mass energy.

Wait, the rest energy is mc², so for astronaut A, the rest energy is 2m c², and B is 3m c². But wait, each is moving, so their total energies are gamma_A * 2m c² and gamma_B * 3m c².

Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Let me calculate gamma for each.

For A: v = 0.6c. So v²/c² = 0.36. 1 - 0.36 = 0.64. sqrt(0.64)=0.8. So gamma_A is 1/0.8 = 1.25.

For B: v=0.5c. v²/c²=0.25. 1-0.25=0.75. sqrt(0.75) is sqrt(3/4) which is (√3)/2 ≈0.8660. So gamma_B is 1/0.866 ≈1.1547.

So the total energy E is (gamma_A * 2m c²) + (gamma_B * 3m c²).

Let me compute each term.

Gamma_A *2m c²: 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

Gamma_B *3m c²: 1.1547 *3m c² ≈3.464 m c².

Adding them together: 2.5 + 3.464 = 5.964 m c². So that's approximately 5.96 m c².

Looking at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc² and v_rel=0.14c. Option D says E=5 mc², which is less.

So the correct option should be C.

To solve the problem, we calculate the relative speed and total energy of the system using relativistic principles.

### Relative Speed
The relative speed of one astronaut as seen from the other is determined using the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{u - v}{1 - \frac{uv}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \( u = 0.6c \) and \( v = 0.5c \). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.5c - 0.6c}{1 - \frac{(0.5c)(0.6c)}{c^2}} = \frac{-0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{-0.1c}{0.7} \approx -0.1428c
\]

The negative sign indicates direction, so the relative speed is approximately \( 0.14c \).

### Total Energy of the System
The total energy of each astronaut is given by the relativistic energy formula:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

#### For Astronaut A (\( v = 0.6c \), mass \( 2m \)):
\[
\gamma_A = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.6c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25
\]
\[
E_A = \gamma_A (2m c^2) = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2
\]

#### For Astronaut B (\( v = 0.5c \), mass \( 3m \)):
\[
\gamma_B = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.5c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]
\[
E_B = \gamma_B (3m c^2) = 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464m c^2
\]

#### Total Energy:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_A + E_B = 2.5m c^2 + 3.464m c^2 \approx 5.96m c^2
\]

### Final Answer
The relative speed is \( 0.14c \), and the total energy of the system is approximately \( 5.96m c^2 \). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:
