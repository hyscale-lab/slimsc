Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's break it down.

The question is about determining the molecular formula of a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. The FTIR shows an ester group, which is a big clue. Esters usually have a carbonyl (C=O) stretch around 1700-1750 cm⁻¹, but that's probably not needed here, since the question focuses on NMR.

Looking at the 1H NMR data: there are six signals. Let's categorize them. Two aromatic-H signals, two vinyl-H (one doublet, one doublet of quartets), and two –CH3 groups. No –CH2 groups, so the structure doesn't have any CH2 units.

So, what's the structure? Let's think. It's a di-substituted benzene ring, so two substituents. The substituents might be groups like esters, because of the IR data.

Esters typically have the structure R-O-CO-O-R', but wait, more accurately, it's R-O-CO-R. So for an ester group, the structure is something like O-CO-O, but wait, no, the ester is RCOOR', so the carbonyl is connected to an oxygen which is connected to another R group.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is an ester group, like –COOCH3 or something similar. But wait, the NMR shows –CH3 groups. So maybe the substituent is an ester with a methyl group attached.

The aromatic ring is di-substituted, so two substituents. Let me imagine a benzene ring with two ester groups attached, but that might complicate things. Alternatively, maybe one substituent is an ester and another is something else.

Wait, but FTIR shows an ester group, so the molecule has at least one ester. Since it's a di-substituted aromatic, perhaps one of the substituents is an ester, and the other is something like a methyl group or another group that contributes CH3.

Wait, but the NMR says two –CH3 signals. So perhaps there are two different methyl groups attached?

Alternatively, maybe one substituent is an ester, and the other is something like a vinyl group or a substituent that has a CH3.

Wait, the NMR shows two –CH3 signals. So maybe the substituents are an ester and another group that has a methyl, like a methyl ester and a methyl group attached directly? Or perhaps the substituents are both ester groups, but with different R groups.

Wait, the substituents are on the benzene ring, right? So maybe each substituent is a group that contributes protons.

Wait, the aromatic-H signals are two, which suggests that the substituents are in such positions that the ring has two types of aromatic protons. For a di-substituted benzene ring, the possible substitution patterns are para, meta, or ortho.

If it's para, the ring would have two equivalent H environments, so two signals. If it's meta, perhaps the protons are all equivalent, but no, wait, no, in meta substitution, the ring would have two different H environments. Wait, let me think.

Wait, when you have two substituents on a benzene ring, the positions can be para, meta, or ortho. For para substituents, the ring has two sets of equivalent protons. For example, if substituents are at positions 1 and 4, the ring would have two types of aromatic protons: the H in position 2 and 6 would be equivalent, and 3 and 5 would be another set. So that's two signals, which matches the NMR data. So maybe the substituents are para.

So, substituents are at para positions. Now, what are the substituents?

One substituent is an ester. Let's say the structure is something like benzene with two ester groups attached. But wait, if both substituents are esters, like two OCOOR groups, then perhaps the NMR would show more signals. Alternatively, maybe one substituent is an ester and the other is a methyl group or another CH3.

Wait, but the NMR shows two –CH3 groups, two vinyl-H, and two aromatic-H. So let's think about what each substituent could be.

The vinyl-H suggests the presence of a double bond. So perhaps one substituent is an ester, and the other is a group with a double bond. Or maybe the substituent itself is part of a double bond.

Wait, but substituents on benzene are typically meta directors if they're electron-withdrawing groups. Esters are meta directors.

Wait, but let's think about the structure. Let me try to imagine the substituent structure.

Suppose one substituent is an ester group, like –OOCR. For example, –OOCCH3 (methyl ester). Wait, but the other substituent would have to contribute the vinyl and the CH3 groups.

Alternatively, perhaps one substituent is a vinyl group. Like, a substituent could be –CH2CH2 something, but wait, but the NMR doesn't have any –CH2 signals, so any CH2 groups in the structure must be either not present or not showing up. But the substituent is a vinyl group, which is CH2=CH-, but that's a CH2 group, but the NMR says no signals for CH2. Hmm, that's a problem.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a methylene group, but not. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a vinyl group attached directly to the ring. Wait, a vinyl group is CH2=CH–, but that would have CH2 groups. But the NMR says no CH2 signals, so that's not possible. So that's a contradiction.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a group without any CH2. Like, maybe an acetylene group, but that's probably not relevant here. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a –CH2– group, but that's not possible because the NMR doesn't show any CH2 signals.

Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let's consider each part of the NMR.

The aromatic protons are two signals. So, two distinct sets of H on the ring. So the substituents are in positions that cause this.

Then, two vinyl-H signals. One is a doublet, the other is a doublet of quartets. Vinyl H's are typically in doublets or triplets, depending on the substitution. For example, in a vinyl group like CH2=CH–, each H would be split based on neighboring H.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a group with a vinyl group, like a CH₂=CH–O– group. But that would have CH₂ groups, which again is problematic because of the NMR data.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a phenyl group with a double bond elsewhere, but that's probably not relevant.

Wait, another thought: perhaps one substituent is an ester group, and the other substituent is a vinyl group attached to the ring. But then, the vinyl group would have CH2 groups, which the NMR says are absent. So perhaps that's not it.

Alternatively, maybe one substituent is an ester, and the other is a methyl group. But that doesn't explain the vinyl-H signals.

Wait, another angle: the two –CH3 groups. So the molecule has two different methyl groups. So perhaps one substituent has a methyl, and another substituent has another type of methyl.

Wait, the ester group is O-CO-O-R. So, if the substituent is –O-CO-O-R, then R could be a methyl group (–O-CO-OCH3), which would give a methyl group in the NMR. But that would be one methyl. Then, the other substituent would have to be another group with a methyl, perhaps a methyl attached directly to the ring. But wait, a methyl attached directly to the ring would be in a CH3 environment, but that's only one methyl. But the NMR shows two –CH3 signals, so perhaps they are different.

Alternatively, the substituents could be an ester (which would have a methyl, like OCOOCH3) and another group like a methoxy group, but that doesn't give a CH3.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are a methyl ester and a vinyl group. Hmm, but again, the vinyl group would have CH2, which is a problem.

Alternatively, perhaps one substituent is an ester, and the other is a propenyl group (like CH₂=CHCH₂–), but that would have CH2 groups, which the NMR says are not present.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Let's think about the degrees of unsaturation.

The formula options are C11H12O2, C11H14O2, C12H12O2, C12H14O2.

The molecular formula needs to be determined. Let's calculate the degree of unsaturation for each option.

Degree of unsaturation (DoU) = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no X or N, it's (2C +2 - H)/2.

So for each option:

A) C11H14O2: DoU = (2*11 +2 -14)/2 = (24-14)/2=5.

B) C12H14O2: DoU= (26 -14)/2=6.

C) C12H12O2: (26-12)/2=7.

D) C11H12O2: (24 -12)/2=6.

So each has a certain number of DoU. The compound has a benzene ring (which is 3 DoU: 3 double bonds or one ring and two double bonds).

Wait, benzene is three double bonds (equivalent to one ring and two double bonds? No, wait, benzene has three double bonds but counts as 4 DoU (one ring and three double bonds, but actually, one ring is one DoU, and three double bonds are three, so total four DoU). Wait, no, the benzene ring counts as 4 DoU: each double bond is one, and the ring is another, but wait, no, each ring and each double bond is a DoU. So benzene has three double bonds, which is three DoU, plus the ring (which is one DoU) because the ring is a cyclic structure. So benzene has four DoU in total.

Wait, wait, no. The degree of unsaturation counts each ring and each double bond as one. So benzene has three double bonds and one ring, but wait, no, the ring is a single DoU, and the double bonds are three. So that's four DoU.

Wait, no, the formula for DoU is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So for benzene (C6H6):

DoU = (2*6 +2 -6)/2 = (14-6)/2=8/2=4. So four DoU, which matches: three double bonds (each is one DoU) and one ring (one DoU) → 4 DoU.

So in our case, the compound has a benzene ring (4 DoU), and the substituents add more DoU.

Looking at the NMR data, there are vinyl protons, which suggests a double bond. So the substituents must account for at least one more DoU.

So the total DoU for the compound would be 4 (benzene) + substituents DoU.

Looking at the options:

Option A: DoU 5 → substituents contribute 1 DoU.

Option B: DoU 6 → substituents contribute 2.

Option C: DoU 7 → substituents contribute 3.

Option D: DoU 6 → substituents contribute 2.

So which is more plausible?

The substituents are probably an ester group and another group with a double bond (vinyl group), which is another DoU.

So substituents could add two DoUs: one from the ester's carbonyl and another from the vinyl group.

Wait, ester's carbonyl is a double bond, so that's one DoU. The vinyl group is another double bond, another DoU. So substituents contribute two DoUs. So the total DoU is 4 (benzene) + 2 (substituents) =6.

Looking at options, both B and D have DoU 6.

So which one is it? Let's think about the molecular formula.

The substituents would be two groups attached to the benzene ring. Let's say each substituent contributes a certain number of carbons and hydrogens.

Assume the benzene is C6H4 (since it's di-substituted).

Each substituent would add some groups.

Suppose one substituent is an ester group, like –OOCR. Let's say R is methyl. So the ester group would be –O–CO–OCH3? No, wait, the ester is RCOOR'. So if the substituent is –OOCR', like –O–CO–OCH3 is incorrect; more accurately, an ester is RCOOR', so substituent would be –COOR', like –COOCH3.

Wait, the substituent group would be –COOCH3. Let's count the carbons: the COOCH3 is three carbons (the carbonyl, the two oxygens, and the methyl). So the substituent adds 3 carbons (from COOCH3).

So the other substituent would be whatever else. Let's say the other substituent is a vinyl group, but wait, that would require another group. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a –CH2CH2 group, but that would have CH2s, which are not in the NMR.

Wait, but the NMR shows –CH3 groups, so perhaps the substituent is a methyl group attached elsewhere.

Alternatively, maybe one substituent is –COOCH3 (ester group), and the other substituent is a –CH2CH3 group, but that would have CH2s, which the NMR doesn't indicate. So that's a problem.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a –CH2– group attached to something else, but again, that would have CH2s.

Wait, but the NMR doesn't show any CH2 groups. So any substituent must not have any CH2 groups. So perhaps the substituent is a –CH3 group, but then why are there two –CH3 signals?

Wait, the substituent might be a group with a –CH3, and another substituent with a different –CH3.

But wait, the substituents are attached to the benzene ring. So, for example, one substituent is –COOCH3, and the other substituent is –CH2CH3. But that would have CH2 groups, which are not in the NMR. So that can't be.

Hmm, perhaps the other substituent is a –CH2– group but without any protons, but that's not possible.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a –CH2– group attached to another group that doesn't have protons. For example, a –CH2–O– group. But then again, that would have CH2.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Let's think of the NMR data again.

The –CH3 signals: two of them. So two different –CH3 groups. So in the structure, there must be two distinct methyl groups.

Ester groups have –O–CO–OR', where R' is, say, methyl (so –O–CO–OCH3). That would be one methyl group.

So perhaps another substituent is a methyl group attached directly to the benzene ring? Like –CH3. But then that's another methyl group.

Wait, but in that case, the substituents would be –COOCH3 and –CH3. So the benzene would have those two groups in para positions.

So the formula would be C6H4–COOCH3–CH3. Wait, no, the substituents are –COOCH3 and –CH3. So the molecular formula would be:

Benzene (6 C) + COOCH3 (2 O, 3 C) + CH3 (1 C). So total C:6 +3 +1=10 C. But the options go up to C12. Hmm, so that's not matching.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me re-calculate.

The benzene ring (C6H5–). Each substituent is attached. Let's take substituent 1: –COOCH3. That adds 3 C (COOCH3 has 3 carbons: C from COO, O, and CH3). Substituent 2: –CH3. Adds 1 C.

So total carbons: 6 (benzene) + 3 (COOCH3) +1 (CH3) =10 C. But the options are C11, C12. Hmm, so that's not matching any option. So perhaps that's not the right approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are more complex. Maybe one substituent is a –CH2–COOCH3 group, but that includes CH2, which is not allowed.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a group without any CH2. Like, a –CH2– group is not present. So maybe the substituent is –CH2–something else, but that's not possible without CH2.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a –C(CH3)=CH2 group, but that would have a double bond and a methyl group. But the –CH2 in the C(CH3)=CH2 would be adjacent to the double bond, so those H's would be vinyl H's.

Wait, let me think about the vinyl H's. The NMR shows two signals: one doublet and one doublet of quartets. So perhaps the substituent has a vinyl group, like CH2=CH–, but in such a way that the H's are split into a doublet and a doublet of quartets.

Wait, for example, in a structure like CH2=CH–O– attached to the ring. But that would have CH2 groups, which the NMR says aren't present. So that's a problem.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is benzyl or something else.

Another thought: maybe the substituent is a cyclopropane ring? Probably not, but just trying to think.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a –CH2–O– group attached to the ring, but that would have CH2 again.

I'm stuck on the substituent part. Let's think differently.

The IR shows an ester, so the molecule has an ester group. The NMR shows two –CH3, two vinyl H, two aromatic H.

So perhaps the structure is a benzene ring with two substituents: one is an ester group, and the other is a group containing a vinyl group and a methyl group.

Wait, but the substituent would then have both a vinyl and a methyl. For example, a –CH2–CH2– group is not possible because of the CH2. But a –CH2–CH3 group would have CH2, which is not present.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is –CH2–COOCH3, but that has CH2.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is –COOCH2CH3 (ethyl ester), but that would have CH2 and CH3 groups. But in that case, the NMR would show CH2 signals, which it doesn't. So that's a problem.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is –COOCH(CH3)2, but that would have more methyl groups.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a –COOCH3 (ester group) and the other substituent is a –CH2CH2COOCH3 group, but that's getting complicated and would have CH2 groups.

I think I'm going in circles. Let's try to think about the number of signals in the NMR.

The 1H NMR has six signals. Let's break it down:

- Two aromatic H signals → two types of aromatic H.
- Two vinyl H signals → two types of vinyl H. One is a doublet, the other is a doublet of quartets. So perhaps the vinyl group is coupled in a way that one H is next to one neighbor (doublet) and the other is next to two (quartet), but I'm not entirely sure.
- Two –CH3 signals → two different CH3 groups.

So, the substituents must account for these protons.

Another approach: Let's consider the possible structures for each option.

Option D: C11H12O2.

Molecular formula: 11 C, 12 H, 2 O.

So degrees of unsaturation: (2*11 +2 -12)/2 = (24-12)/2=6. Subtract the four from benzene, so substituents contribute two DoU.

Which would be one double bond (ester's carbonyl) and another double bond (vinyl), which fits.

So the substituents would be –COOCH3 and something else with a double bond. But how?

Wait, substituent 1: –COOCH3 (ester, adds 3 C, 3 H (CH3)). Substituent 2: –CH2CH2? No, because of CH2.

Alternatively, substituent 2 could be –CH2–COOCH3, but that brings back CH2.

Alternatively, substituent 2 is a –CH2– group connected to something else, but that brings CH2.

Hmm. Alternatively, substituent 2 is a –CH3 group. So substituents are –COOCH3 and –CH3.

So the formula would be: C6H5–COOCH3–CH3.

Wait, let's calculate the formula:

C6 (benzene) + COOCH3 (3 C, 3 H) + CH3 (1 C, 3 H) → C6+3+1=10 C, H: 5 (from benzene, di-substituted: benzene is C6H6, di-substituted would be C6H4, so substituents add H: each substituent may add H.

Wait, substituent –COOCH3 has a structure like O=C-O-CH3. The –COOCH3 substituent is a –OOCR group attached to the benzene.

Wait, wait, if the benzene has two substituents: one is –OOCR (ester) and another is –CH3.

So the structure would be:

Benzene ring with substituents at para positions: one is –OOCR (say, –OOCCH3) and the other is –CH3.

Wait, but –OOCCH3 is a methyl ester group. So the substituents are –OOCCH3 and –CH3.

So the molecular formula:

C6 (benzene) + OOCCH3 (3 C, 4 O's? Wait, no: –OOCCH3 is O2CCH3, so the substituent is –O–CO–CH3.

Wait, –OOCCH3 would be –O–CO–CH3. So the substituent is one O, one COOCH3 group.

Wait, but wait, the entire substituent would be O=C-O-CH3 attached to the ring via the oxygen.

So the substituent is –O–CO–CH3.

So the substituent brings 3 carbons (COOCH3) and 3 oxygen atoms (but the overall formula counts O as 2 in the ester group). Wait, the ester group is O–CO–O–. No, wait, the ester is R-O-CO-R'. So in this case, substituent is –O–CO–OCH3? No, that's not right. Wait, no, the ester group is RCOOR', so substituent is –OOCR', like –O–CO–R'.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me write the structure of the ester substituent.

The substituent is –OOCR. So for R = methyl, substituent is –OOCCH3.

So the substituent adds 3 carbons (COOCH3) and 2 oxygen atoms (since –OOCR has O from the ester linkage and O from the R group). Wait, no. The structure is –O–CO–R. So substituent is –O–CO–OCH3? No, that's incorrect. The correct structure is –O–CO–R, where R is the alkyl group.

Wait, no, the ester group is R-O-CO-R', so substituent would be –O–CO–R'. For R' = methyl, substituent is –O–CO–OCH3? No, wait, no. The ester group is RCOOR', so substituent is –OOCR', like –O–CO–R' where R' is methyl. So substituent is –O–CO–OCH3? No, wait, no. Wait, the ester group is RCOOR', so if the substituent is an ester group attached via the oxygen, it would be –O–CO–R'. So substituent is –O–CO–R', where R' is, say, methyl. So the substituent is –O–CO–CH3.

So substituent brings 3 carbons (the COOCH3 part), 3 oxygen atoms? Wait, no. The substituent is –O–CO–CH3, so it contributes 3 carbons (C from COO, O, and CH3), 3 oxygen atoms (O from the ester linkage, O from COO, and O from CH3? No, wait, the substituent is –O–CO–CH3, so it has two oxygen atoms: one in the ester linkage (O connecting to the ring) and the carbonyl O. Wait, no, the structure is O=C-O-R. So substituent is –O–CO–R. R is methyl, so substituent is –O–CO–CH3. So substituent has 3 C (O=C-O-CH3: the C is from COO, and the CH3). So substituent is 3 C, 3 O? No, substituent is –O–CO–CH3, which is 3 C, 3 O (O from the ester group, O from the COO, and O from the CH3? No, wait, the –O–CO–CH3 group has two oxygen atoms: the O connecting to the ring and the O in the carbonyl. The CH3 doesn't have an O. So substituent has 2 O and 3 C.

Wait, not sure. Let me think about the molecular formula.

The substituent is –O–CO–CH3. So, the substituent contributes:

- 3 carbons: one from the COO, one from the O, and one from CH3.
- 2 oxygen atoms: from the ester group.

So the substituent –O–CO–CH3 adds 3 C and 2 O.

The other substituent is –CH3, which adds 1 C and 3 H.

So the overall formula:

Benzene (6 C, 6 H) → but di-substituted → becomes C6H4.

Adding substituent 1: –O–CO–CH3 → adds 3 C, 3 H (from CH3), 2 O.

So now, C: 6 + 3 =9, H:4 (from benzene) +3 (from substituent 1) =7. O:2.

Adding substituent 2: –CH3 → adds 1 C, 3 H.

So C: 9 +1 =10; H:7 +3=10; O:2.

But the formula options are C11, C12, etc. So this gives C10H10O2, which isn't in the options.

So perhaps my assumption is wrong.

Alternative approach: Let's look at the options.

Option D: C11H12O2.

So 11 C, 12 H, 2 O.

If the benzene is C6, substituents contribute 5 C and 8 H (since benzene di-substituted is C6H4, so substituents add 5 C and 8 H).

Wait, substituents contribute 5 C and 8 H.

One substituent is an ester group, which has 3 C (–COOCH3) and 3 H (CH3). The other substituent would contribute 2 C and 5 H.

Wait, a substituent that contributes 2 C and 5 H. So perhaps the other substituent is –CH2CH3 (ethyl group), but that has CH2 groups, which are not in the NMR.

Alternatively, substituent could be –CH2CH2–, but that's again CH2.

Hmm, perhaps the substituent is a –CH2– group connected to another group without CH2. I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a –CH3 group and another –CH2– group, but that brings CH2.

Another thought: Perhaps one substituent is –COOCH3 (3 C, 3 H, 2 O), and the other substituent is –CH2–COOCH3. But that's getting too complex and brings CH2 groups.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is –COOCH2CH3 (ethyl ester), which would have 5 C (COO plus ethyl). Then substituents would be:

–COOCH2CH3 (5 C, 3 H from the ethyl, I think?) and –CH3 (1 C, 3 H). So total substituents: 6 C, 6 H.

But benzene is 6 C, so total C:6 +6=12. H:4 (benzene di-substituted) +6=10 H. O: from ester is 2.

But the formula would be C12H10O2. Which is not among the options.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is –COOCH2CH2CH3 (propyl ester), but that adds more carbons.

Wait, the options only go up to C12H14O2, so perhaps that's possible.

Another possibility is that the substituents are –COOCH3 and another group with a double bond and a methyl.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is –CH2–COOCH3, but that brings CH2 groups.

Alternatively, substituent is –CH2–CH2–COOCH3, but that has CH2 groups.

Wait, maybe the substituent is –CH2–COOCH2CH3, but again, CH2 groups.

This isn't working. Let's think about the vinyl protons. The NMR shows two vinyl H, one as a doublet and another as a doublet of quartets. So perhaps the substituent has a vinyl group, like –CH2–CH2–, but that brings CH2.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a –CH2–CH2– group attached to the ring, but that's CH2 again.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a –CH2–O– group, but again, CH2.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for another approach.

The substituent that contributes a vinyl group must have a double bond without CH2 groups. So perhaps the substituent is a –CH3 group attached to a double bond, like –CH2–CH2– but that's not possible without CH2.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a –CH2– group adjacent to a double bond, but that would have CH2.

Alternatively, the substituent could be a cyclopropane ring, but that's probably not relevant.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a –CH2– group attached to an aromatic ring, but that brings CH2.

I'm stuck again. Let's think about the molecular formula again.

Option D: C11H12O2.

Assuming the substituents are –COOCH3 and another group that contributes 5 C and 9 H (since benzene di-substituted is C6H4, so adding substituents brings to C11H12O2.

Wait, substituent 1: –COOCH3 → 3 C, 3 H, 2 O.

Substituent 2: 5 C, 9 H.

Wait, substituent 2 would be CH2=CH–O–? No, that brings CH2.

Alternatively, substituent 2 is a –CH2–CH(CH3) group. But that brings CH2.

Alternatively, substituent 2 is a –CH2–COOCH3 group, but that's again CH2.

Alternatively, substituent 2 is a –CH3 group, but that would only contribute 1 C and 3 H. So substituents would be 3+1=4 C, but benzene is 6, so total 10 C. But option D is 11 C, so that doesn't fit.

Hmm. This is getting too complicated. Let me think differently.

The NMR shows two –CH3 groups. So the molecule has two methyl groups. One could be from the ester (–COOCH3) and another from somewhere else.

If the other substituent is a –CH3 group attached to the ring, then:

Total substituents: –COOCH3 and –CH3.

So the formula would be C6 (benzene) + 3 (COOCH3) +1 (CH3) =10 C.

But none of the options have 10 C. So perhaps that's not correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a –CH2–COOCH3 group, which adds 4 C (CH2, COOCH3). So substituent is –CH2–COOCH3.

So substituent 1: –COOCH3 (3 C, 3 H).

Substituent 2: –CH2–COOCH3 (4 C, 3 H from CH3, but the CH2 brings 2 H, but the NMR says no CH2 signals).

That's a problem.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is –CH2–CH2–COOCH3, but that brings more CH2 groups.

Alternatively, substituent is –CH2–CH3, but that brings CH2.

I'm stuck. Maybe I should try to consider the options and see which one fits.

Option D: C11H12O2.

The molecular formula would be 11 C, 12 H, 2 O.

Assuming benzene is C6H4 (di-substituted), substituents contribute 5 C and 8 H.

So substituents: 5 C, 8 H.

If one substituent is –COOCH3 (3 C, 3 H), the other substituent is 2 C, 5 H.

So substituent 2 must be 2 C and 5 H. What group has 2 C and 5 H?

Perhaps a –CH2–CH3 group, but that's 2 C, but 5 H? No, –CH2CH3 has 2 C and 3 H in the CH2 and 3 H in CH3. Wait, that's 6 H, which is too much.

Wait, substituent 2 is 2 C and 5 H. So perhaps a –CH(CH3)2 group? No, that's 3 C.

Alternatively, a –CH2– group but that's not possible without H.

Hmm.

Alternatively, substituent 2 is a –C(CH3)=CH2 group. Wait, that's 3 C. No.

Wait, substituent 2 could be a –C=CH2 group, which has 2 C and 2 H (since each CH2 has 2 H). But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps substituent 2 is a –C≡C– group, but that's triple bond and that would be 2 C and 4 H? Not sure.

Alternatively, substituent 2 is a –CH2–O– group, but that brings CH2.

I'm not making progress here. Let me think about the NMR.

The –CH3 signals are two, which means two different methyl groups. So perhaps the substituent has a methyl group and another group elsewhere has a methyl.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a –COOCH2CH3 (ethyl ester), which has a CH2CH3 group. But that would have CH2 groups, which are not in the NMR.

Alternatively, substituent is a –COOCH(CH3)2 (isopropyl ester), which would have two methyl groups attached to a CH. So that would be two –CH3 signals.

But wait, the substituent –COOCH(CH3)2 would have:

–COO–C(CH3)2.

So the –COO group is attached to a C that has two CH3 groups.

In this case, the –COO group is attached to a C(CH3)2 group.

So the substituent would be –O–CO–O–C(CH3)2? No, wait, the ester is RCOOR', so substituent would be –COO–C(CH3)2.

Wait, no. The substituent would be –COOCH(CH3)2, which is an isopropyl ester.

So the substituent would contribute:

COO (2 C) and CH(CH3)2 (3 C) → so substituent is 5 C in total.

But then substituent 1 is –COOCH(CH3)2 (5 C, 2 O), and substituent 2 is –CH3 (1 C, 3 H).

So the formula would be:

Benzene (6 C) + substituent 1 (5 C) + substituent 2 (1 C) → 12 C.

H: substituent 1: isopropyl ester has 2 CH3 groups (each with 3 H) and the substituent has (COO-) which doesn't add H except the CH(CH3)2 (which has 1 H from the central CH). Wait, isopropyl group is CH(CH3)2, which has 1 H attached to the central C.

So substituent 1: –COOCH(CH3)2 → contributes 1 H (from CH) and 6 H (from two CH3). So 7 H from substituent 1.

Substituent 2: –CH3 → 3 H.

Benzene di-substituted: C6H4 → 4 H.

Total H:4 +7 +3 =14 H.

O: substituent 1 has 2 O.

So overall formula would be C12H14O2, which is option B.

Wait, but let me check.

So substituent 1: –COOCH(CH3)2 → 5 C (COO is 2 C, CH(CH3)2 is 3 C, including the C attached to the O). So substituent 1 contributes 5 C.

Substituent 2: –CH3 → 1 C.

So total carbons:6 (benzene) +5 +1=12 C.

Hydrogen:

Benzene di-substituted:4 H.

Substituent 1: COOCH(CH3)2 → has 1 H (from CH) and 6 H (two CH3) → 7 H.

Substituent 2: –CH3 →3 H.

Total H:4 +7 +3=14 H.

O: substituent 1 →2 O.

So formula is C12H14O2 → option B.

Now, checking the NMR:

Aromatic protons: two signals, which fits para substitution.

Vinyl H: substituent 1 has a double bond? No, the substituent is –COOCH(CH3)2, which doesn't have a double bond. Hmm, that's a problem because the NMR shows vinyl H.

Wait, that's a problem. So if substituent 1 is –COOCH(CH3)2, does that contribute any vinyl H? No, because it's an ester without a double bond. So where do the vinyl H come from?

Ah, perhaps I made a mistake in the substituent choice. Let me rethink.

If the substituent is –COOCH(CH3)2, it doesn't have a double bond, so no vinyl H. But the NMR shows two vinyl H signals, so that's conflicting.

So perhaps the substituent has a double bond. So substituent 2 must have a double bond.

Wait, alternative approach: let's say substituent 1 is –COOCH3 (ester, 3 C, 3 H), and substituent 2 is –CH2CH2COOCH3 (but that has CH2 groups, which are not present in NMR).

Alternatively, substituent 2 is –CH2–COOCH3, but again, CH2.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps substituent 2 is a –CH2– group attached to a double bond elsewhere. Like, –CH2–CH2–, but that brings CH2.

Alternatively, substituent 2 is a –CH2–CH3 group, but again CH2.

I'm stuck again.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a –CH2–CH2– group attached to the ring, but that brings CH2.

Alternatively, substituent is a –CH3 group, but that doesn't explain the vinyl H.

Hmm. Maybe I need to consider that the substituent is a vinyl group connected to another group, but without CH2.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a –CH2– group connected to a double bond. Like –CH2–CH2–, but that's CH2 again.

Alternatively, substituent is –CH2–CH2–COOCH3, but again, CH2.

Another thought: Maybe the substituent is a –CH3 group and another substituent is a –CH2–CH2– group, but that brings CH2.

I'm going in circles. Maybe I should accept that the correct answer is option C: C12H12O2, which has DoU of 7.

But earlier I thought substituents contributed two DoU, making total DoU 6, so option B or D.

Alternatively, if substituents contribute three DoU, making total 7, which would be option C.

How can substituents contribute three DoU?

Each substituent can contribute one DoU. So two substituents contribute two DoU. But to reach three, perhaps one substituent contributes two DoU.

Wait, a substituent with a double bond and a ring. But I don't think that's likely.

Alternatively, one substituent is a benzyl group (which has a ring and a double bond?), but that's getting too complex.

I'm not making progress, so perhaps I should look for another approach.

Looking at the options, option D is C11H12O2. Its formula is C11H12O2. The degrees of unsaturation are 6.

So, substituents contribute 2 DoU.

Which would be one from the ester's carbonyl and another from a double bond elsewhere.

So, substituent 1: –COOCH3 (DoU=1).

Substituent 2: –CH2–CH2– (DoU=0, but that brings CH2).

Alternatively, substituent 2 is –CH2–CH2–, but CH2 is not allowed.

Alternatively, substituent 2 is a –CH2– group attached to a double bond.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is –CH2–CH2–COOCH3. But that brings CH2 groups.

Alternatively, substituent 2 is a –CH2– group attached to a ring, but that brings CH2.

I'm stuck again.

Perhaps the correct answer is option D: C11H12O2.

But I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C: C12H12O2.

But without a clear structure, it's hard to say.

Wait, another angle: the number of signals.

The 1H NMR has six signals, which matches with the aromatic (2), vinyl (2), and –CH3 (2).

So, the structure must have two methyl groups, two vinyl H, and two aromatic H.

If the substituent is a –COOCH3 (one methyl) and another substituent with a vinyl group and a methyl, then:

Substituent 2 would have a vinyl group and a methyl, but without any CH2.

Wait, substituent 2 could be a –CH2–CH2– group, but that's CH2 and not allowed.

Alternatively, substituent 2 is a –CH3 group and a vinyl group attached to the ring.

Wait, substituent 2 could be a –CH3 group attached to a double bond. Like, –CH2–CH3, but that's CH2.

Alternatively, substituent 2 is –CH3 attached to a double bond elsewhere in the molecule.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a –CH3 and the other substituent is a –CH2–CH2– group, but that's not helpful.

Hmm. I think I'm stuck, and perhaps the correct answer is option D: C11H12O2.

But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are a –COOCH3 and a –CH2– group attached to a double bond, but that brings CH2.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is –CH2–COOCH3, but that brings CH2.

I think I'll have to make a guess based on the options.

Given that the substituents contribute two DoU (so total 6), and the molecular formula with 11 C fits substituent 1 (3 C) and substituent 2 (5 C?), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a –COOCH2CH3 (ethyl ester) but that brings CH2.

Wait, ethyl ester would have –O–CO–OCH2CH3 as substituent. But that brings CH2 groups, which the NMR doesn't show.

So, that's not possible.

In the end, I think the correct answer is option D: C11H12O2.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves identifying the molecular formula of a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound based on FTIR and ¹H NMR data. The FTIR spectrum indicates the presence of an ester group, while the ¹H NMR spectrum shows six signals: two aromatic-H signals, two vinyl-H signals (one doublet and one doublet of quartets), and two –CH₃ signals, with no –CH₂ signals. The options provided are C₁₁H₁₂O₂, C₁₁H₁₄O₂, C₁₂H₁₂O₂, and C₁₂H₁₄O₂.

### Key Analysis:
1. **FTIR Data**: The presence of an ester group is confirmed, which contributes a carbonyl (C=O) group. This suggests the molecule contains at least one ester functional group.

2. **¹H NMR Data**:
   - **Aromatic-H Signals (2 signals)**: The di-substituted benzene ring likely has two distinct aromatic proton environments, consistent with para substitution.
   - **Vinyl-H Signals (2 signals)**: The presence of vinyl protons indicates a double bond in the structure. The splitting patterns (doublet and doublet of quartets) suggest coupling between protons on adjacent carbons of a double bond.
   - **–CH₃ Signals (2 signals)**: The molecule contains two distinct methyl groups.
   - **No –CH₂ Signals**: The absence of –CH₂ groups implies that any substituents or structural features do not include methylene groups.

3. **Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU)**:
   - Benzene contributes 4 DoU (3 from double bonds and 1 from the ring).
   - The ester group contributes 1 DoU (from the carbonyl).
   - The vinyl group contributes 1 DoU (from the double bond).
   - Total DoU = 6, which matches options B (C₁₂H₁₄O₂) and D (C₁₁H₁₂O₂).

4. **Molecular Formula Options**:
   - **Option A (C₁₁H₁₄O₂)**: DoU = 5. This does not account for the vinyl group, which requires an additional DoU.
   - **Option B (C₁₂H₁₄O₂)**: DoU = 6. Matches the total DoU required (4 from benzene, 1 from ester, 1 from vinyl).
   - **Option C (C₁₂H₁₂O₂)**: DoU = 7. Exceeds the required DoU, making it less likely.
   - **Option D (C₁₁H₁₂O₂)**: DoU = 6. Matches the total DoU required.

5. **Structural Considerations**:
   - The molecule is a di-substituted benzene ring with two substituents. One substituent is likely an ester group (–COOCH₃), contributing a methyl group and a carbonyl. The other substituent must account for the vinyl protons and the second methyl group.
   - A plausible structure is a para-substituted benzene with one substituent as an ester (–COOCH₃) and the other as a group containing a double bond and a methyl group (e.g., –CH=CH–CH₃). This structure aligns with the NMR data and the absence of –CH₂ signals.

6. **Final Selection**:
   - Option D (C₁₁H₁₂O₂) fits the molecular formula based on the substituents and the total DoU. The ester group and the vinyl-substituted methyl group are consistent with the NMR and IR data.

### Conclusion:
The molecular formula of the unknown compound is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.
