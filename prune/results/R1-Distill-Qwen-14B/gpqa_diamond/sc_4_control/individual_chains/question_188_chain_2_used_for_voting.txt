Okay, so I have this question about crystallography, and I need to find the interplanar distance for a (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to remember what I learned.

First, I remember that the interplanar distance (d) in a crystal is calculated using something called the Bragg's law, but wait, no, that's more about the diffraction. Oh right, the formula I need is the interplanar spacing formula for crystals. I think it's d = a / sqrt(l² + m² + n² + 2lm cos α + 2ln cos β + 2mn cos γ), but wait, no, maybe I'm mixing it up.

Wait, no, the correct formula for a rhombohedral crystal, which has all sides equal and all angles equal, is a bit simpler. Because in a rhombohedral system, a = b = c, and the angles α, β, γ are all the same, which in this case is 30 degrees each.

The interplanar distance formula for a cubic crystal is d = a / sqrt(h² + k² + l²), but that's only for cubic. Since rhombohedral isn't cubic, the formula must be adjusted.

Oh right, the general formula for interplanar distance in a crystal is given by:

1/d² = (h²)/(a²) + (k²)/(b²) + (l²)/(c²) - (2hk cosθ)/(a b) - (2hl cosφ)/(a c) - (2kl cosψ)/(b c)

But wait, in a rhombohedral system, a = b = c = a0, and all angles are equal. So substituting, it should simplify.

So for a rhombohedral crystal, the formula reduces to:

1/d² = (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) - (2hk cos α)/(a²) - (2hl cos β)/(a²) - (2kl cos γ)/(a²)

Since α=β=γ=30 degrees, and a = b = c = 10 Angstrom.

Wait, wait, but wait, in a rhombohedral system, the three vectors are equivalent. So perhaps the formula can be rewritten as:

d = (a) / sqrt( h² + k² + l² - 2hk cos α - 2hl cos α - 2kl cos α )

Because all angles are the same, so cos α = cos β = cos γ.

So putting that together, for the (111) plane, h=1, k=1, l=1.

So plug in the numbers.

So compute the denominator first: sqrt(1 + 1 + 1 - 2*(1)(1)*cos30 - 2*(1)(1)*cos30 - 2*(1)(1)*cos30 )

Wait, let's compute each term. Let's compute the numerator inside the sqrt first.

h² + k² + l² = 1 + 1 +1 = 3.

Now, the other terms:

-2hk cos α: since hk=1*1=1, and cos30 is sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.866.

So each of the three terms (-2hk cos α etc.) will contribute -2*1*0.866.

So each of the three terms is -2 * cos30, so each is approximately -1.732.

But wait, each term is -2hk cos α, so for h=k=1, each is -2*1*1*(sqrt(3)/2) = -sqrt(3) ≈ -1.732.

So three such terms: 3*(-sqrt(3)).

So the entire expression under sqrt is:

3 - 3*sqrt(3)

Wait, because 3 (from h² etc.) minus 3√3.

So total is 3(1 - sqrt(3)).

Wait, but 3 is about 3, and 3√3 is about 5.196. So 3 -5.196 is about -2.196. But that can't be right because you can't take the square root of a negative number. Hmm, that can't be right. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, wait, maybe I messed up the signs. Let's double-check. The formula is:

d = a / sqrt( h² +k² +l² - 2hk cos α - 2hl cos α - 2kl cos α )

Wait, the formula is [h² +k² + l² - 2hk cos α - 2hl cos α - 2kl cos α ].

So for h=k=l=1, it's 3 - 2*(1)(1)cos30 * 3 times.

Wait, no. Wait:

Wait, 2hk cos alpha is 2*1*1*cos30, same for 2hl and 2kl. Since each pair hk, hl, kl is 1.

So 2*1*1* cos30 is 2*(sqrt(3)/2) )= sqrt(3). So each of the three terms is sqrt(3).

So the denominator becomes sqrt( 3 - 3*sqrt(3) )

Wait, but that's sqrt(3 - 5.196), which is sqrt(-2.196). That can't be right, since you can't have a negative under the square root. That must mean I did something wrong.

Wait, perhaps I confused the angles. Because in a rhombohedral system, the angles are the angles between the axes, but I'm not sure if the formula uses the angles as given or perhaps the angles are different.

Wait, perhaps I should think differently. Another approach: the interplanar distance formula for rhombohedral is given by:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos α )

Wait, wait no, that can't be right because when the angles are acute, the interplanar distance would be larger, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I got the signs wrong.

Let me check the correct formula again. Oh wait, perhaps the formula is:

1/d² = (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) - (2hk cos α + 2hl cos β + 2kl cos γ)/(a²)

But for a rhombohedral system, α=β=γ=60 degrees? Wait, no, in this problem it's 30 degrees. Wait, no, rhombohedral can have any angle as long as it's not 90. For instance, in a cubic system, all angles are 90, and a=b=c. For a rhombohedral, a=b=c, but angles are not 90.

Wait, I think I made a mistake in the formula. Let me see.

I found a resource: the interplanar spacing for a rhombohedral crystal is given by:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos α )

Wait, is that correct? Or is it minus?

Wait, double-checking.

Wait, the general formula for interplanar distance is:

1/d² = (h²/A²) + (k²/B²) + (l²/C²) - 2(hk cos γ)/(A B) - 2(hl cos β)/(A C) - 2(kl cos α)/(B C)

But in a rhombohedral, A = B = C = a, and angles α, β, γ may not all be the same. Wait, no, in a rhombohedral, all the angles are the same. So α=β=gamma=theta.

Wait, but maybe I'm confusing the angles. I think in a rhombohedral system, the angles between the axes are all equal, say theta. So the formula would become:

1/d² = (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) - 2[ hk cos theta + hl cos theta + kl cos theta ] / a²

Hmm, that would be:

1/d² = [ h² +k² +l² - 2hk cos theta - 2hl cos theta - 2kl cos theta ] / a²

Which can be written as:

d = a / sqrt( h² +k² +l² - 2 cos theta ( hk + hl + kl ) )

So for h=k=l=1, and theta=30 degrees.

So substituting:

h² +k² +l² = 3.

hk + hl + kl = 3.

So:

d = 10 / sqrt( 3 - 2 * (3) * cos30 )

Compute cos30: that's sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660.

So 2 * 3 * 0.8660 = 6 * 0.8660 ≈ 5.196.

So denominator inside sqrt is 3 -5.196 = -2.196.

Wait, that's negative. That can't be possible. So sqrt of a negative number is not a real number. That doesn't make sense. So I must have made a mistake in the formula.

Hmm, perhaps the formula has a plus instead of a minus? Because if I swap the sign, it would be 3 +5.196=8.196. Let me think.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( h² +k² + l² + 2 cos theta (hk + hl + kl) )

Because when I think about the interplanar distance, for a cubic, when theta is 90, cos theta is zero, and the formula reduces to d= a/sqrt(h² +k² +l²), which is correct.

Wait, but wait, in a cubic system, the formula is 1/d² = (h² +k² +l²)/a², so yes, in that case, the cross terms (with cos theta) would be zero because cos 90=0.

So if the general formula is 1/d² = (h² +k² +l²)/(a²) + (2 cos theta (hk + hl + kl))/(a²), would that make sense? Let's see.

Wait, but no, because when the angle is 90, cos theta=0, so it gives the correct formula for cubic. But in our case, for a rhombohedral system, angle is 30 degrees, so cos theta is positive.

Wait, but for the (111) plane, if the formula uses a plus, then let's compute:

d = a / sqrt( h² +k² +l² + 2 cos theta (hk + hl + kl) )

Wait, but for h=k=l=1, that becomes sqrt(3 + 2 * cos30 * 3 )

Because (hk + hl + kl) is 3 (since 1*1 + 1*1 +1*1=3). So:

sqrt(3 + 2 * (sqrt(3)/2) * 3 ) = sqrt(3 + 3*sqrt(3)).

Wait, let me compute that.

3 + 3*sqrt(3) ≈ 3 + 5.196 ≈8.196.

So sqrt(8.196) ≈2.863.

So d = 10 / 2.863 ≈3.492 Angstrom.

Wait, but none of the options are that low. The options are around 8-10 Angstroms. Hmm. So perhaps I'm getting the formula wrong.

Wait, perhaps I confused the formula. Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2 (hk cos α + hl cos β + kl cos gamma) )

Wait, but in a rhombohedral, all angles are same, so α=β=gamma=30 degrees.

So 1/d² = [h² +k² + l² - 2 (hk cos30 + hl cos30 + kl cos30) ] / a²

Which is [3 - 2*3*cos30 ] / (10^2).

Wait, that's [3 -6*(sqrt(3)/2)] /100.

Which is [3 -3*sqrt(3)] /100.

So 3 is 3, 3*sqrt(3)≈5.196.

3-5.196≈-2.196.

So 1/d² is negative, which can't be right. So this suggests that the formula is not correct as I'm applying it.

Wait, perhaps I got the formula wrong. Let me think again. Maybe the formula for rhombohedral is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2*(hk + hl + kl)*cos(alpha) )

Wait, that would make the denominator sqrt(3 + 2*3*(sqrt(3)/2)).

Wait, sqrt(3 + 3*sqrt(3)).

Which is sqrt(3 + 5.196) = sqrt(8.196) ≈ 2.863.

So d ≈10 / 2.863 ≈3.49 Angstrom. But again, the options are much higher.

Wait, maybe the formula is supposed to have a negative. Let's see: if I take the denominator as sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2*(hk + hl + kl)*cos(alpha) ), but that would give 3 - 5.196= -2.196, which is negative.

Hmm, that's not working. Maybe I should approach this differently.

Another approach: the interplanar distance for a rhombohedral can be found using the formula:

d = a / sqrt( (h + k + l)^2 - (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) ) * something.

Wait, no, that seems unclear.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of vectors. The interplanar distance is related to the reciprocal lattice vectors.

Alternatively, maybe I can compute the unit vectors and find the plane normal.

In a rhombohedral system, the lattice vectors are a, b, c, each of length a0=10 Angstrom, and the angles between them are 30 degrees.

Wait, so the vectors are a, b, c, with |a|=|b|=|c|=a0, and the angles between a and b is 30, between a and c is 30, and between b and c is 30.

The plane (111) is defined by the Miller indices h=1, k=1, l=1.

The normal vector to the plane is n = h a* + k b* + l c*, where a*, b*, c* are the reciprocal lattice vectors.

Wait, perhaps another approach: the interplanar distance can be found by the formula:

d = 1/(sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2(hk cos α + hl cos β + kl cos gamma) )).

Wait, no, I think earlier I was mixing up the formula.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

d = (a) / sqrt( h² + k² + l² - 2(hk cos α + hl cos β + kl cos γ) )

But in a rhombohedral system, alpha = beta = gamma = 30 degrees.

So, substituting h=1, k=1, l=1:

d = 10 / sqrt( 3 - 2*(1*1*cos30 + 1*1*cos30 + 1*1*cos30) )

Which is 10 / sqrt(3 - 6*(sqrt(3)/2)).

Simplify 6*(sqrt(3)/2) = 3 sqrt(3) ≈5.196.

So 3 -5.196= -2.196.

So denominator is sqrt(-2.196), which is imaginary. That can't be right. So this suggests that the formula is incorrect, or that the (111) plane does not exist in this crystal structure, which is unlikely.

Wait a minute, perhaps I got the formula wrong. Let me look for another approach.

An alternative approach is to use the formula for interplanar spacing in terms of the unit cell parameters.

The general formula is:

d_{hkl} = 1/ sqrt( (h^2)/(a^2) + (k^2)/(b^2) + (l^2)/(c^2) - 2hk cos γ/(a b) - 2hl cos β/(a c) - 2kl cos α/(b c) )

In a rhombohedral system, a = b = c = a0, and α = β = gamma = theta.

So substituting:

d_{hkl} = 1 / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²)/(a0²) - 2 (hk cos theta + hl cos theta + kl cos theta ) / a0² )

Factor out 1/a0²:

d_{hkl} = a0 / sqrt( h² +k² + l² - 2 (hk + hl + kl ) cos theta )

Ah, so I think I had the formula correct. But for our case, with theta=30, h=k=l=1:

d = 10 / sqrt( 3 - 2*(3)*cos30 )

Which is 10 / sqrt(3 -6*(sqrt(3)/2))=10/sqrt(3 -3*sqrt(3)).

Wait, 3*sqrt(3) is approximately 5.196. So 3-5.196= -2.196.

But sqrt of a negative number is not real. Thus, this would imply that the interplanar distance is imaginary, which is impossible. That can't be. So perhaps I made a mistake in the angles.

Wait, wait, perhaps in the formula, the angles are 180 - theta, because sometimes the angle between vectors is taken as the supplementary angle. Because in crystallography, the lattice angles are defined in a way that in a rhombohedral system, the angles can't all be less than 90 degrees. Wait, no, rhombohedral systems can have all angles equal and less than 90, or between 90 and 120, depending on the type (acute or obtuse rhombohedral).

Wait, maybe I should think about the definition of the angles. If the angle between the vectors is 30 degrees, then the angle in the formula would be 30 degrees. But perhaps the formula uses the angle between the lattice vectors as 180 - 30 =150 degrees.

Wait, that's possible. Because sometimes the angle used in the formula is the angle between the vectors, which in a rhombohedral can be obtuse.

Wait, but how does that work? Let me think. The angle between the vectors a and b is alpha. If the angle is acute (30 degrees), then the formula should work as is. But perhaps when the angle is acute, some (hkl) planes don't exist because of the negative terms.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is correct, but for a certain (hkl) plane, the expression under the square root might be positive.

Wait, for h=k=l=1, with a=10 Angstrom and alpha=30 degrees.

Let me compute the denominator again:

h² +k² +l² =3.

2(hk + hl + kl) cos alpha = 2*(3)* cos30 =6*(sqrt(3)/2) =3*sqrt(3)≈5.196.

So 3 -5.196= -2.196.

Negative, which is impossible. So perhaps the (111) plane is not possible in this structure because the denominator is negative. So perhaps the correct (hkl) plane is different, but the question states (111).

Hmm, perhaps this suggests that I'm using the wrong formula.

Wait, another approach: the volume of the unit cell in a rhombohedral system is V = a^3 * sqrt(1 - 3 cos^2 theta + 2 cos^3 theta ).

But I'm not sure if that's helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps the reciprocal lattice vectors can help. The reciprocal lattice vectors are given by:

b1 = (1/a)(2 pi) (e_x - e_y (cos alpha)/(1 - cos alpha) - ... )

Wait, that's getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for interplanar distance in terms of the unit vectors.

The plane (111) has normal vector n = a + b + c.

The interplanar distance d is the magnitude of the dot product of the unit vectors along the normal with the position vector of the plane.

Wait, perhaps that's a better way.

In a rhombohedral system, each vector a, b, c has length a0=10 Angstrom, and the angles between them are 30 degrees.

The normal vector n = a + b + c.

The magnitude of n is |n| = sqrt( |a|^2 + |b|^2 + |c|^2 + 2 a·b + 2 a·c + 2 b·c )

Compute each dot product:

a·b = |a||b| cos alpha = a0^2 cos 30.

Similarly, a·c = a0^2 cos30, and b·c = a0^2 cos30.

So |n|^2 = 3 a0^2 + 2 * 3 * (a0^2 cos30 )

= a0^2 [3 + 6 cos30 ]

= a0^2 [3 + 6*(sqrt(3)/2) ]

= a0^2 [3 + 3*sqrt(3) ]

So |n| = a0 * sqrt(3 + 3 sqrt(3)).

The interplanar distance d is (a0)/( |n| ) multiplied by the reciprocal of the normal vector's magnitude.

Wait, no, the interplanar distance is the reciprocal of the magnitude of the reciprocal lattice vector? Hmm, perhaps not.

Wait, the formula for interplanar distance is d = 1/( (h a* + k b* + l c*) · n ), where n is the normal vector.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the Miller indices.

Wait, no, let me try this approach. The interplanar distance d is given by 1/(sqrt( (h a*)^2 + (k b*)^2 + (l c*)^2 + ... )) )

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, the interplanar distance can be found using the formula:

d = (a) / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos alpha )

But wait, that's the same as before. Which gives the sqrt of a negative number.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Because according to the formula, the denominator is negative, which can't be right.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos alpha )

In that case, for our situation:

Denominator inside sqrt: 3 + 2*(3)*cos30 =3 +6*(sqrt(3)/2)=3 +3*sqrt(3) ≈3 +5.196=8.196.

So sqrt(8.196) ≈2.863.

So d=10 / 2.863 ≈3.49 Angstrom.

But the options are all around 9 Angstrom. So I must be missing something.

Wait, perhaps the formula uses the angle of 150 degrees instead of 30 degrees. Because in a rhombohedral system, the angles can sometimes be defined as the angles between the reciprocal lattice vectors, which could be 180 minus the given angle.

If I use alpha = 150 degrees, cos alpha= cos 150= -sqrt(3)/2 ≈-0.866.

So let's compute again.

With cos 150 = -sqrt(3)/2.

So for the formula d = a / sqrt(3 - 2*3*cos alpha )

Plugging in cos alpha= -0.866:

3 -2*3*(-0.866) =3 +5.196=8.196.

So sqrt(8.196)≈2.863.

So d=10/2.863≈3.49 Angstrom.

Still not matching the options. Hmm.

Wait, but wait another thought. Maybe in the formula, the angles are the angles between the lattice vectors, and in some cases, the angle used is 180-theta. Because sometimes in crystallography, the angles are the angles between the lattice vectors as viewed in the unit cell, which could be the obtuse angle.

So if the given angle is 30 degrees, perhaps the actual angle to use in the formula is 180-30=150 degrees. So cos(alpha)=cos(150)= -sqrt(3)/2.

So let's try that.

So using cos(alpha)= -sqrt(3)/2.

Now, denominator inside sqrt: 3 - 2*(1*1*(-sqrt(3)/2) )*3.

Wait, wait the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( h² +k² + l² - 2 (hk cos alpha + hl cos beta + kl cos gamma) )

But since alpha=beta=gamma=150 degrees, cos(150)= -sqrt(3)/2.

So for (111):

Denominator inside sqrt is:

3 - 2*(1*1*(-sqrt(3)/2) + 1*1*(-sqrt(3)/2) + 1*1*(-sqrt(3)/2) )

= 3 - 2*(3*(-sqrt(3)/2) )

=3 - 2*(-3*sqrt(3)/2 )

=3 + 3*sqrt(3) ≈ 3 +5.196=8.196.

So sqrt(8.196)= approx 2.863.

d= 10 / 2.863 ≈3.49 Angstrom.

Still not matching the options.

Wait, the options are all in the 8-10 range. So perhaps I have a misunderstanding here.

Alternative approach: Maybe the question refers to a face-centered cubic structure, which is a special case of a rhombohedral structure with alpha=beta=gamma=60 degrees. But in this case, the angles are 30, which is different.

Wait, let me re-express the formula.

Another thought: Perhaps I should use the formula for a general hexagonal system, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the formula. Let me look for a different approach.

Wait, the general formula for the interplanar distance is given by:

d = (a) / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2 (hk cos α + hl cos β + kl cos gamma) )

But in the problem, alpha=beta=gamma=30 degrees.

Which gives:

d =10 / sqrt(3 - 2*(3)*cos30 )

Compute cos30= sqrt(3)/2≈0.866.

So denominator inside sqrt is 3 - 2*3*0.866=3-5.196= -2.196.

Which is negative. So this would mean that the (111) plane doesn't exist in this structure, which can't be right. So perhaps the (111) plane is not allowed, but the question says to find it, so there's something wrong.

Wait, perhaps the formula is different. Another thought: perhaps the correct formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2 (hk + hl + kl ) cos alpha )

But if I use that, then denominator inside sqrt is 3 + 2*3*(sqrt(3)/2)=3 +3*sqrt(3)≈3+5.196=8.196.

So d=10/sqrt(8.196)≈10/2.863≈3.49 Angstrom.

But no option is near 3.5.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstrom, but wait, in a rhombohedral structure, the interatomic distance (say, between adjacent atoms) is the same as 'a', the lattice parameter. So a=10 Angstrom.

Wait, but perhaps the formula is using a different 'a'. Hmm, no, I think I'm using it correctly.

Wait, perhaps the question is not about a primitive rhombohedral system but another type. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is different for rhombohedral systems.

Wait, another thought: in a cubic system, the (111) plane's interplanar distance is a/sqrt(3). With a=10, this is 10/1.732≈5.77 Angstrom. But the options are higher, so perhaps the angle makes it larger.

Wait, in our case, if the formula gives a smaller distance because of the negative terms, but that's not possible. So I'm getting stuck.

Maybe I should look up the correct formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system.

According to some sources, the interplanar distance for rhombohedral is given by:

d_{hkl} = (a) / sqrt( h² +k² +l² + 2 (h k + h l +k l) cos α )

Where alpha is the angle between the lattice vectors, and for rhombohedral, all angles are equal.

But then, with alpha=30 degrees, and h=k=l=1,

d=10 / sqrt(3 + 2*3*(sqrt(3)/2 )) =10 / sqrt(3 +3*sqrt(3)).

Which is the same as before, giving 3.49 Angstrom.

But the options are much higher.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( h² +k² +l² - 2 (h k + h l +k l) cos alpha )

Which would lead to:

3 - 6*(sqrt(3)/2 ) =3 -3*sqrt(3)= negative.

Impossible.

Wait, perhaps the formula uses the supplementary angle, so 180-30=150 degrees.

So cos(150) = -sqrt(3)/2.

Then, the denominator is:

3 - 2*3*( -sqrt(3)/2 )

=3 + 3*sqrt(3) ≈8.196.

So sqrt(8.196)=2.863.

d=10/2.863= approx 3.49 Angstrom. Still doesn't match the options.

Hmm, perhaps I'm miscalculating the angles. Let me think about the structure.

Wait, perhaps the rhombohedral system is in such a way that the (111) planes are actually more spread out. Maybe the formula I'm using is correct, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute sqrt(3 +3*sqrt(3)).

Let me compute 3 +3*sqrt(3) numerically.

sqrt(3)≈1.732.

So 3 *1.732=5.196.

So 3+5.196=8.196.

sqrt(8.196)= approx 2.863.

d=10/2.863 ≈3.49 Angstrom.

But the options are all above 8 Angstrom. So perhaps I'm calculating the wrong quantity.

Wait, perhaps the question is referring to the interatomic distance as the distance between atoms along the edge, which is a=10 Angstrom. But the interplanar distance is the distance between adjacent planes, which is different.

Wait, but the calculation I did gives a small d, which is lower than a. But in reality, the interplanar distance can't be larger than 'a' in most cases except perhaps in some structures.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused because the formula gives a much smaller d than a. But in this case, the options are much larger than a, which is 10. So that can't be.

Wait, I must be missing something here. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos(alpha) )

Which for our case is 3 +3*sqrt(3) as before.

So d=10/2.863≈3.49.

But the options are all much larger, around 8-10. So perhaps the correct approach is to take the reciprocal of this value.

Wait, wait, perhaps I should take the reciprocal for some reason. If d is 3.49, then 1/d ≈0.286. But that's not matching the options either.

Another possibility: perhaps the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + (2 h k cos alpha) + (2 h l cos beta) + (2 k l cos gamma) )

But that would be 3 + 3*sqrt(3), same as before.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos alpha )

But when that gives a negative, perhaps it's impossible, so maybe the correct formula is d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos alpha )

But with our numbers, it's negative, so perhaps the (111) plane is not allowed for this structure?

But the question says to find it, so that can't be the case.

Wait, perhaps the actual formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos (180 - alpha) )

Which would be cos(150 degrees)= -sqrt(3)/2.

So substituting:

3 -2*(3)*(-sqrt(3)/2 )=3 + 3*sqrt(3)=8.196.

So d=10/sqrt(8.196)=10/2.863≈3.49 Angstrom.

But that's still not matching the options.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake with the signs. Let me check the formula again.

After some research, I find that the correct formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is indeed:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( h^2 +k^2 +l^2 - 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos θ )

Where θ is the angle between the lattice vectors.

So for our case, θ=30 degrees.

Thus, the expression under the square root is 3 - 2*(3)*cos30.

Which is 3 -6*(sqrt(3)/2)=3-3*sqrt(3)=3−5.196=−2.196.

So the denominator would be imaginary, which is impossible, suggesting that the (111) plane does not exist for this crystal.

But the question says to find it, implying that it's possible. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the angle with 60 degrees instead of 30. Let me try with 60 degrees.

If theta=60 degrees, cos(theta)=0.5.

So denominator becomes 3-2*(3)(0.5)=3-3=0.

Which leads to d=10/0, which is infinity, which is also impossible.

Hmm. This is confusing. Let me think differently.

Perhaps the given interatomic distance is not 'a' but something else, but the question says it's a rhombohedral crystal with interatomic distance 10 Angstrom. So a=10.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

d= a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) + 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos theta )

Which for theta=30 degrees:

Denominator:3 + 3*sqrt(3)=8.196.

d=10 / 2.863≈3.49 Angstrom.

But again, not matching the options.

Wait, perhaps the question's answer is option C, 9.54 Angstrom, which is approximately 10/sqrt(1.048), but I can't see the connection.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) + 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos alpha )

Which gives 3 +3*1.732= 3+5.196=8.196.

So sqrt(8.196)=2.863.

d=10/2.863≈3.49 Angstrom.

But that's not matching any options.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the interatomic distance is not a, but that a is the lattice parameter, which could be different.

Wait, the question says interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom. So in a rhombohedral structure, the interatomic distance is the distance between neighboring atoms along the edges, which is a. So a=10.

Hmm.

I think I might have to proceed with the formula I have, and perhaps the options are incorrect, but since that's not an option, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the formula is 1/d² = (h² +k² +l² - 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos theta ) / (a² )

Wait, but if theta=30, then 1/d² = (3 - 6*0.866 ) /100= (3 -5.196)/100= (-2.196)/100= -0.02196.

That's negative, which can't be correct.

Hmm.

Another approach: Maybe the angles given are the angles between the crystallographic axes as seen in the unit cell, but in reality, the angles used in the formula are the angles between the vectors from the origin, which could be 60 degrees.

Wait, perhaps the given angles are the angles between the edges of the unit cell, which may be different. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another resource I found says that in a rhombohedral system, the relation between the lattice vectors is a = b = c, and the angles between them are all equal, say theta.

The volume of the unit cell is V = a^3 * sqrt(1 - 3 cos^2 theta + 2 cos^3 theta )

But I don't see how that helps with the interplanar distance.

Alternatively, perhaps I should proceed with the calculation and see which option is closest to 3.49, but none of the options are near that.

Wait, perhaps the question meant to use a different plane, like (220). But the question says (111).

Wait, perhaps the interplanar distance formula for a rhombohedral system is incorrect, and I should use a different approach.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the interplanar distance can be found using the reciprocal of the magnitude of the reciprocal lattice vector.

The reciprocal lattice vector for (hkl) is (h a* +k b* + l c* ), where a*, b*, c* are the reciprocal vectors.

The reciprocal vectors are given by:

a* = (1/a) (1, 0, 0) / sin(alpha) ... wait, no, perhaps a different approach.

Wait, for a rhombohedral system with a=b=c and angles alpha between each pair, the reciprocal vectors have the same magnitude.

The reciprocal lattice parameters are:

a* = 1/a.

But I'm not exactly sure.

Wait, perhaps the reciprocal vectors are given by:

a* = 1/(a sin beta sin gamma) ( ... )

But it's getting complicated.

Hmm. I think I'm stuck. Given the time I've spent and the information I have, I'll proceed with the initial formula.

Wait, wait, perhaps the formula is different. I found another source stating that for a rhombohedral system, the interplanar distance is given by:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos theta )

Where theta is the angle between the lattice vectors.

So in this case, theta=30 degrees, cos theta= sqrt(3)/2 ~0.866.

So:

d=10 / sqrt(3 + 2*3*(0.866) )

=10 / sqrt(3 + 5.196 )

=10 / sqrt(8.196 )=10/2.863≈3.49.

But none of the options match, so perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but assuming the options are correct, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the angle is 60 degrees. Let me try theta=60.

Then cos theta=0.5.

Denominator:3 + 2*3*0.5=3+3=6.

So d=10/sqrt(6)=10/2.449≈4.08 Angstrom.

Still not matching.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the formula uses the angle gamma between the c-axis and the other vectors, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should take the reciprocal of the calculation, but that would give 1/3.49≈0.286, which is much smaller than the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula has a different exponent. Maybe it's d= a * sqrt(...), not divided by.

But that would give d=10*sqrt(8.196)=10*2.863≈28.63, which is way higher than the options.

Hmm. Given that I can't find a way to get the answer into the 8-10 range, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos theta )

But in this case, it's impossible because the denominator becomes negative.

So perhaps the correct approach is to choose the option closest to 3.49, but the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

d = [a^2 (h^2 +k^2 +l^2 - 2 hk cos alpha - 2 hl cos beta - 2 kl cos gamma ) ]^(-1/2)

Which would give the same result as before, leading to a negative value.

So in that case, perhaps the correct answer is not possible, but since the question says to choose from the options, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2 (hk cos α + hl cos β + kl cos gamma) )

Which would give 3 +3*0.866*2=3+5.196=8.196.

d=10/sqrt(8.196)=3.49.

No match.

Hmm. I think I'm stuck. Since none of the options match my calculation, perhaps I should consider that the formula uses the angle between the lattice vectors as 180-30=150 degrees.

So cos(150)= -0.866.

Then:

d=10/ sqrt(3 - 2*3*(-0.866) )

=10/sqrt(3 +5.196 )=10/sqrt(8.196)=3.49.

Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos theta )

Which is same as before.

Wait, perhaps the answer is option C, 9.54 Angstrom. Let me compute 10/sqrt( (111) terms).

Wait, let me compute 10/sqrt( (1^2 +1^2 +1^2) + 2*(1+1+1)*cos(alpha) )

Wait, no, the formula is 3 + 2*(3)*cos(theta).

But with theta=150, gives 3+ 2*3*(-0.866)=3-5.196= -2.196. Can't do.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is different. Another thought: perhaps the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos theta )

Which gives 3 -6*cos(theta).

With theta=30, cos(theta)=0.866.

So 3-6*0.866=3-5.196= -2.196. Not possible.

With theta=150, cos(theta)= -0.866.

So 3-6*(-0.866)=3+5.196=8.196.

So d=10/sqrt(8.196)=3.49.

But again, not matching options.

Hmm.

At this point, I think I must have made a mistake in the formula, but I can't find the correct approach. Given the options, perhaps the intended answer is option C) 9.54 Angstrom.

Wait, 9.54 is close to 10/sqrt(1.048). But I can't see the connection.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

d= a * sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos theta )

Which would be 10 * sqrt(3-5.196)=10*sqrt(-2.196), which is invalid.

So I'm stuck. Perhaps I should proceed with the formula and select the closest option, but none match. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C, 9.54 Angstrom.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the interplanar distance \( d \) for the (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal, the formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is used:

\[
d_{hkl} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{h^2 + k^2 + l^2 - 2(hk + hl + kl) \cos \alpha}}
\]

Here:
- \( a = 10 \, \text{Å} \) (interatomic distance),
- \( h = k = l = 1 \) (Miller indices for the (111) plane),
- \( \alpha = 30^\circ \) (angle between lattice vectors).

### Step 1: Compute the denominator
The denominator inside the square root is:

\[
h^2 + k^2 + l^2 - 2(hk + hl + kl) \cos \alpha
\]

Substituting \( h = k = l = 1 \) and \( \cos 30^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \):

\[
\text{Denominator} = 3 - 2 \cdot 3 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
\]

\[
\text{Denominator} = 3 - 3\sqrt{3}
\]

Approximating \( \sqrt{3} \approx 1.732 \):

\[
\text{Denominator} = 3 - 3(1.732) = 3 - 5.196 = -2.196
\]

### Step 2: Analyze the result
The denominator becomes negative, which is physically impossible since the square root of a negative number is not real. This suggests that the (111) plane does not exist in this rhombohedral structure with \( \alpha = 30^\circ \). However, since the question explicitly asks for the interplanar distance, it is assumed that the calculation should proceed with the given formula.

### Step 3: Consider supplementary angles
In some cases, the angle used in the formula is the supplementary angle, \( 180^\circ - \alpha \). For \( \alpha = 30^\circ \), the supplementary angle is \( 150^\circ \), and \( \cos 150^\circ = -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \). Substituting this into the formula:

\[
\text{Denominator} = 3 - 2 \cdot 3 \cdot \left(-\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)
\]

\[
\text{Denominator} = 3 + 3\sqrt{3}
\]

Approximating \( \sqrt{3} \approx 1.732 \):

\[
\text{Denominator} = 3 + 3(1.732) = 3 + 5.196 = 8.196
\]

### Step 4: Compute \( d \)
\[
d = \frac{10}{\sqrt{8.196}}
\]

Approximating \( \sqrt{8.196} \approx 2.863 \):

\[
d \approx \frac{10}{2.863} \approx 3.49 \, \text{Å}
\]

### Step 5: Compare with options
The calculated interplanar distance \( d \approx 3.49 \, \text{Å} \) does not match any of the provided options, which are all in the range of 8–10 Å. This discrepancy suggests either an issue with the formula or the interpretation of the problem. Given the options, the closest plausible answer is **C) 9.54 Å**, though the reasoning does not fully align with the calculations.

Answer: C
