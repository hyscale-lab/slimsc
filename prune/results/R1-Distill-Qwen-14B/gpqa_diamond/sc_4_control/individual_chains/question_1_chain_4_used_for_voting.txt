Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here about energy levels and their lifetimes. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The question says there are two quantum states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds respectively. We need to find the energy difference between E2 and E1 so that they can be clearly distinguished.

Wait, I remember something about the uncertainty principle here. Oh right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. It says that the product of the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) and the uncertainty in time (Δt) is at least h/(4π), where h is Planck's constant. But wait, I think for lifetimes, the uncertainty in time is the lifetime itself. So Δt is basically the lifetime τ.

So the formula would be ΔE * τ ≈ h/(4π), or maybe just hbar (ħ) times something. Wait, ħ is h/(2π), so let's get the exact equation right.

The uncertainty principle states that ΔE * Δt ≥ ħ/2. Or is it ħ/(2π) times something? I might be mixing it up. Let me think. The general form is ΔE Δt ≥ ħ/2. Or is it ħ/(π) or something else? Hmm, sometimes I see it written as ΔE Δt ≈ ħ. Wait, I need to get this right.

Alternatively, for energy measurements, the time it takes for the state to decay (the lifetime τ) relates to the precision of the energy measurement. So if the lifetime is τ, the uncertainty in energy is about ħ/(τ). Because the energy can be known with a precision up to ΔE ≈ ħ/τ. So to resolve two energy levels, the energy difference ΔE between them must be larger than the uncertainty, which is ħ/τ.

Wait, but which τ do I use here? The question gives two different lifetimes. Oh, wait, the two states have different lifetimes. Oh, but the question is about the energy difference between them. So I think each state has its own uncertainty.

Wait, but wait. If each state has a different lifetime, how does that affect the ability to resolve them? Hmm, maybe I should think about the broader principle here: the energy difference must be such that the two states can be distinguished in an experiment.

Wait, perhaps the key is to find the minimum energy difference that can be resolved given the measurement time. Or maybe it's about the spectral lines and their linewidths.

Alternatively, considering that each state has a certain natural linewidth determined by its lifetime. The natural linewidth is given by ΔE ≈ ħ/τ. So for E1 with τ1 =1e-9 s, ΔE1 = ħ/(1e-9). Similarly, for E2 with τ2=1e-8 s, ΔE2= ħ/(1e-8).

But wait, to resolve two states, their energy difference must be larger than the sum of their uncertainties? Or is it the maximum uncertainty of either?

Wait, I think when two energy levels are close, their spectral lines might overlap. To resolve two lines, the separation between them should be greater than the sum of their linewidths. Or perhaps the sum of half their linewidths. Hmm, that's something I might be getting confused on.

Alternatively, maybe the energy difference just needs to be larger than the uncertainty of each state individually. Because if the difference is larger than either's uncertainty, you can tell them apart.

Wait, let me think with numbers. Let's compute ħ/(τ) for each τ.

Planck's constant h is about 6.626e-34 J·s. ħ is h/(2π) ≈ 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So for τ1 = 1e-9 s,
ΔE1 = ħ/τ1 = (1.0545718e-34 J·s) / (1e-9 s) = 1.0545718e-25 J.

Convert that to eV because the options are in eV. 1 eV is about 1.602e-19 J, so:

ΔE1 = 1.0545718e-25 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 6.58e-7 eV.

Wait, wait, let me compute that again.

Wait, 1.05457e-34 J·s divided by 1e-9 s is 1.054e-25 J. Now, 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J. So 1 J is about 6.242e18 eV.

So 1.054e-25 J * (1 eV / 1.602e-19 J) = (1.054e-25) / (1.602e-19) ) eV.

Let me compute that: 1.054e-25 / 1.602e-19 = approximately 6.58e-7 eV.

Wait, same for τ2 = 1e-8 s:

ΔE2 = ħ/(1e-8) = 1.0545718e-34 / 1e-8 = 1.0545718e-26 J.

Convert to eV:

1.0545718e-26 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 6.58e-8 eV.

So ΔE1 is about 6.58e-7 eV, and ΔE2 is about 6.58e-8 eV.

Now, to resolve two states, the energy difference must be larger than the sum of their uncertainties, or the maximum of the two? Hmm, I'm a bit confused.

But wait, the question is about the energy difference between E2 and E1. So the energy difference is E2 - E1 = ΔE.

We need ΔE > (ΔE1 + ΔE2)/something? Or perhaps the maximum of ΔE1 and ΔE2. Or maybe it's the sum because the uncertainties might overlap.

Wait, perhaps the energy difference must be greater than the uncertainty of each state. But if the energy difference is larger than either ΔE1 or ΔE2, then you can resolve them.

Wait, because the uncertainty in each measurement is ΔE1 and ΔE2, respectively. So if the actual energy difference is larger than both, then the two energies are distinguishable.

Wait, but let me think about this. When you measure the energy of a state with lifetime τ, the uncertainty is about ħ/τ. So if two states have energies E1 and E2, and their uncertainties are ΔE1 and ΔE2, then for them to be distinguishable, the separation between E1 and E2 must be larger than ΔE1 + ΔE2.

Ah, that makes sense. Because if the energies were within each other's uncertainty ranges, you wouldn't be able to tell them apart.

So the required condition is |E2 - E1| > ΔE1 + ΔE2.

So let me compute that sum.

ΔE1 is 6.58e-7 eV, ΔE2 is 6.58e-8 eV.

Sum is 6.58e-7 + 6.58e-8 = 7.238e-7 eV.

So the energy difference must be greater than approximately 7.238e-7 eV.

Looking at the options, let's see:

Options:

A) 1e-9 eV → 0.001e-6 eV → 1e-9 is way smaller than 7.2e-7. So no.

B) 1e-11 → even smaller.

C) 1e-4 eV → 0.0001 eV → which is 1e-4, which is 1e-4 = 1e4 *1e-8 → much larger than 7.2e-7. So 1e-4 is 10000 times larger than 7.2e-7. So this would be resolved.

D) 1e-8 eV → 1e-8 is 0.1e-7 → which is 0.14 times 7.2e-7. So 1e-8 is less than 7.2e-7, so not sufficient.

Wait wait, wait, no. Let me compute the sum again. Oh wait, 6.58e-7 is 0.658e-6, 6.58e-8 is 0.0658e-6. Sum is 0.7238e-6, which is 7.238e-7 eV.

So the energy difference must be larger than ~7.2e-7 eV. So looking at options:

Option C is 1e-4 eV = 1e-4 = 1e4 *1e-8 eV = 0.1e-4 eV. Wait, 1e-4 is 1e-4 eV.

Wait, 1e-4 is 100,000 times larger than 7.2e-7. So yes, option C is way larger.

Option D is 1e-8 eV, which is 0.1e-7, which is smaller than 7.2e-7 (which is 0.72e-6), so D is too small.

So the only option larger than the required sum is C.

Wait but wait, the question gives two lifetimes. So what is the correct approach? Because each state has its own uncertainty, and the energy difference must be larger than the sum of these.

So, for example, if E2 is higher than E1 by ΔE, then to see a clear separation, ΔE must be greater than both ΔE1 and ΔE2, or the sum?

Hmm, perhaps it's the sum. Because the uncertainty in E2 is ΔE2, and the uncertainty in E1 is ΔE1. So if the energy difference is less than ΔE1 + ΔE2, the two states might overlap in their energy ranges, making them indistinguishable.

Therefore, the energy difference must be bigger than ΔE1 + ΔE2.

So using my previous calculation, the sum is about 7.2e-7 eV.

So the correct energy difference should be larger than 7.2e-7 eV.

Looking at the options, only option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 1e-4 = 0.0001 eV, which is 1e-4 eV = 1e-4 eV. Wait, 1e-4 is 0.0001 eV, which is 1e-4 eV. Which is much larger than 7.2e-7 eV. So option C would be clearly resolvable.

Wait, but wait, the options are:

A) 1e-9 eV → 0.001 meV → no.

B) 1e-11 → 0.0001 meV → no.

C)1e-4 → 0.1 meV → yes.

D)1e-8 → 0.01 meV → no.

So the correct answer is C.

To determine the energy difference required to clearly distinguish two quantum states with energies \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \), we use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. The uncertainty in energy for a state with lifetime \( \tau \) is approximately \( \Delta E \approx \hbar / \tau \), where \( \hbar = h / (2\pi) \) and \( h \) is Planck's constant. For the two states with lifetimes \( \tau_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \) and \( \tau_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \), the uncertainties in energy are:

\[
\Delta E_1 = \frac{\hbar}{\tau_1} = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}}{10^{-9} \, \text{s}} = 1.0545718 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{J}.
\]
Converting to electron volts (\( 1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)):

\[
\Delta E_1 = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-25}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 6.58 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
\]

Similarly, for \( \tau_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \):

\[
\Delta E_2 = \frac{\hbar}{\tau_2} = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}}{10^{-8} \, \text{s}} = 1.0545718 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J}.
\]
Converting to eV:

\[
\Delta E_2 = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-26}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 6.58 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}.
\]

To resolve the two energy levels, the energy difference \( \Delta E = |E_2 - E_1| \) must be greater than the sum of the uncertainties:

\[
\Delta E > \Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2.
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\Delta E > 6.58 \times 10^{-7} + 6.58 \times 10^{-8} = 7.238 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
\]

Now, compare this threshold with the given options:

- **Option A: \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \) is much smaller than \( 7.238 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so this is insufficient.

- **Option B: \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \) is even smaller than \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \), so this is also insufficient.

- **Option C: \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} = 1 \, \text{meV} \), which is much larger than \( 7.238 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). This satisfies the condition.

- **Option D: \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \) is smaller than \( 7.238 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so this is insufficient.

The only option that satisfies the condition is **Option C**.
