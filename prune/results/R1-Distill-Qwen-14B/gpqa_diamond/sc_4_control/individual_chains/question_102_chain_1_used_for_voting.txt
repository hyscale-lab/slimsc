Okay, let me try to figure this out. So, the question is about a genetic construct and why the eGFP isn't showing up in the mice. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's break it down.

So, the setup is they have a ligand-receptor pair, initially found in neural crest cells. They want to study their developmental roles. The ligand is a coiled-coil with two alpha helices, and the receptor is a monomeric transmembrane protein with eight alpha helices, four extracellular, and three beta sheets. So, that probably means the receptor is a GPCR or something similar, but not sure if that matters here.

They made a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. Bicistronic means two genes in one vector. The ligand's ORF is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry. The receptor is at the 3' end, fused to eGFP at the C-terminus. So, ligand-mCherry and receptor-eGFP.

The ligand is under the CBA promoter. I think CBA is a strong promoter, maybe constitutive. Upstream of the receptor is an IRES regulatory element. IRES usually allows internal ribosome entry, so it can drive expression of a second gene without a promoter, like in some bicistronic vectors. So, the ligand is under CBA, and the receptor is under the control of the IRES element which is after the ligand.

But wait, the vector has loxP and lox2272 stop cassettes. Between ligand ORF and mCherry, there's a stop in a loxP-stop-loxP cassette. And between receptor and eGFP, a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette. So, this is probably a way to control expression using Cre. LoxP sites are recognized by Cre recombinase, which deletes the intervening DNA, including the stop cassette.

They used this in a mouse model. Homozygous for the construct in a wild-type background. Then they crossed it with SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice. SOX10 is involved in neural crest development, so Cre would be expressed in neural crest cells, I think.

So, the construct is designed so that when Cre is present, it will delete the stop cassettes, allowing expression of both ligand (with mCherry) and receptor (with eGFP). But in the offspring, they don't see a green signal, which is from eGFP.

Possible reasons: the eGFP isn't being expressed. Let's look at the options.

Option A: Ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship. Paracrine means they act on nearby cells. But I'm not sure how this affects the expression. If both are expressed, they should be in the same cell? Or maybe not. Wait, but the construct is in the same vector, so the ligand and receptor should be co-expressed in the same cells where Cre is active. If they are paracrine, that might mean ligand and receptor are in different cells. But in this setup, since they're using the same vector, maybe the ligand and receptor are expressed in the same cells. So, this might not explain why eGFP isn't expressed.

Option B: Receptor-eGFP is stuck in the Golgi. That would mean it's not on the cell surface, so you wouldn't see fluorescence. But the question says they used antibodies to test expression via Western blot. If the protein isn't being synthesized, the antibody wouldn't detect it. Alternatively, if it's stuck in Golgi, maybe the Western would still pick it up because it's a stop in the construct. Wait, the Western blot after transfection showed signals proportional to actin, meaning their loading is correct, but maybe the proteins weren't expressed? Or perhaps the antibodies worked.

Wait, the user says they used antibodies against overexpressed proteins and ran a Western after plasmid transfection. So perhaps in the transfected cells, they saw the ligand and receptor expressed. But in the mouse model, when they cross it with SOX10-Cre, the eGFP isn't showing up. Hmm.

Option C: The enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing. The construct uses CBA promoter for ligand and IRES for receptor. CBA is a strong promoter, so maybe the enhancer isn't needed. Or maybe the IRES isn't working. If the enhancer were missing, the ligand might not be expressed. But the question says the mice are homozygous for the construct, so perhaps the expression is supposed to be driven by CBA and IRES. Not sure yet.

Option D: Receptor and eGFP are not in frame. The eGFP is fused to the C-terminus of the receptor. If they're not in frame, the fusion protein might be truncated, leading to a nonfunctional or nonexpressed protein. But wait, the stop cassettes are lox2272. After Cre is used, the stop is removed, so the receptor ORF should be correctly expressed, right? If the eGFP is in frame, it'll be a proper fusion. If not, maybe the protein is not made correctly. But in the Western blot, when they transfected the plasmid, they saw expression. So in the plasmid, the eGFP is correctly expressed, but in the mouse, maybe it's not. So I'm not sure. Or perhaps the frame is correct but the stop cassette is in between, preventing expression.

Wait, the setup is a bicistronic vector. The ligand is first, then a stop cassette with loxP. Then the receptor with IRES and another stop cassette with lox2272. Wait, actually, the vector is ligand (CBA promoter), then a stop cassette flanked by loxP, then the receptor with IRES, then a stop cassette flanked by lox2272. So the idea is that when Cre is expressed, it will delete the loxP and lox2272 sites, which removes the stop cassettes, allowing both the ligand and receptor to be expressed.

Wait, no. Since the vector is bicistronic, it's probably a single transcript. So the first gene is under CBA, then the IRES drives the second gene. But the stop cassettes are in between. So when Cre is present, the stop cassettes are removed, allowing both genes to be expressed.

But for the vectors, sometimes the stop cassette is placed between the gene and the fluorescent marker. So for the ligand, the ORF is followed by a stop cassette (loxP). So, without Cre, the stop cassette prevents mCherry from being expressed. But when Cre is present, the stop cassette is removed, so the ligand is expressed along with mCherry. Similarly, for the receptor, the ORF is followed by a stop cassette (lox2272), which prevents eGFP expression until Cre deletes it.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The ligand ORF is at 5', then a stop with loxP, then the receptor ORF, which is under the IRES. Then a stop with lox2272. So the vector would transcribe a single mRNA. The first ORF is ligand with a stop, then the IRES would drive the receptor. So in normal conditions (without Cre), the stop cassettes prevent the downstream expression. Wait, but in a bicistronic vector, the IRES allows the second gene to be expressed without the need for a promoter. So the ligand is under CBA, which is strong, and the receptor is under IRES, which is weaker. But the stop cassettes complicate things.

Wait, the setup is that the ligand is first, with a stop cassette (so without Cre, the mRNA can't go further to the receptor). But I'm a bit confused on how the stop cassettes work. When the stop is in between the ligand ORF and mCherry, that means that without Cre, the mRNA for ligand would terminate, not allowing mCherry to be expressed. But the receptor is after the IRES, so perhaps the stop cassette after the receptor's ORF would prevent eGFP expression.

Wait, the vector is ligand (CBA promoter), then a stop cassette (loxP), then mCherry? Or is the ligand fused to mCherry? The question says: ligand ORF at 5' position, fused to mCherry. So probably, the ligand is in frame with mCherry, such that upon expression, the ligand is expressed with mCherry at the C-terminus. But the stop cassette is between ligand ORF and mCherry. So without Cre, the stop cassette (loxP) would prevent mCherry from being expressed. When Cre is present, the stop is removed, so ligand-mCherry is expressed as a fusion.

Similarly, the receptor ORF is at 3', fused to eGFP at C-terminus. So the receptor is in frame with eGFP, but the stop cassette is between them. Without Cre, the eGFP isn't expressed. With Cre, the stop is removed, so the receptor-eGFP is expressed.

But in the mouse model, they are homozygous for the construct. The mice are crossed with SOX10-Cre, which is a Cre line active in neural crest cells. So in the offspring, the Cre should delete the stop cassettes, allowing both ligand and receptor to be expressed, each as a fusion with their fluorescent markers.

But the Western blot was done after plasmid transfection in primary astrocyte culture. So they transfected the plasmid into astrocytes. They used antibodies against the overexpressed proteins and saw a signal proportional to actin. So that suggests that the plasmid construct was functional and the proteins were expressed. So the issue isn't with the construct design in general but perhaps something else in the mouse model.

But when they look under the confocal, they don't see green. So eGFP isn't expressed in the mouse. Why?

Possible issues: The Cre isn't active, so the stop cassettes aren't removed. But the mice were crossed with SOX10-Cre, which is supposed to drive Cre in neural crest cells. Alternatively, maybe the Cre isn't active in the cells where the construct is expressed.

Wait, the construct is inserted into the genome, so when Cre is active, the loxP sites are recognized. But in the mouse model, the Cre is under SOX10 promoter, which is active in neural crest cells. So perhaps the construct is intended to be expressed in neural crest-derived cells. But maybe the expression of the construct is not in the same cells where Cre is active.

Wait, but the vector is designed to be under CBA promoter for ligand and IRES for receptor. CBA is a strong promoter, so it's expressed everywhere. But the Cre is only active in neural crest cells. So in the mouse, the ligand and receptor are expressed everywhere, but the eGFP and mCherry are only expressed where Cre is active.

Wait, but when Cre is active, the stop cassettes are removed, so in cells where Cre is active, both the ligand-mCherry and receptor-eGFP should be expressed. So in the mouse, the eGFP should show up in the neural crest cells.

But in the experiment, the mouse is homozygous for the construct. So both alleles have the same. When they cross to SOX10-Cre, the offspring would have the construct and Cre. So the Cre should delete the stop cassettes in the cells where SOX10 is expressed (neural crest cells). So in those cells, the constructs should be active, and eGFP should be expressed.

But the question says they don't see a green signal. Hmm.

Looking at the answer options. Option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. So in the mouse, the eGFP isn't being expressed because the frame is wrong. But in the plasmid transfection, the Western blot showed expression. So that suggests that in the plasmid, the proteins are correctly expressed. So perhaps the issue is that in the mouse, the construct is misinserted or the lox sites are not recognized.

Wait, the loxP and lox2272 are different. Lox2272 is a variant of loxP that requires Cre to delete. So when Cre is expressed, the loxP sites (like in the ligand's stop cassette) would be cut, and the lox2272 sites would also be cut. So the stop cassettes are removed, and the constructs are expressed.

But in the mouse, perhaps the Cre isn't working. Or, perhaps the vector didn't integrate correctly. Alternatively, maybe the IRES isn't working correctly for the receptor.

Alternatively, perhaps the eGFP is not being translated because it's not in frame, but that would have been detected in the Western.

Wait, Western blot uses antibodies against the overexpressed proteins. So if the receptor-eGFP is not expressed, the Western would show no band. But the question says the Western blot after transfection gives a signal proportional to actin. So the proteins were expressed in the transfected cells. So the construct works in vitro.

So why isn't eGFP expressed in the mouse?

Another thought: the cre isn't active in the cells where the construct is being expressed. Wait, but the construct is under CBA, so it's expressed everywhere. But the eGFP expression is controlled by the stop cassette. Only in cells where Cre is active (like neural crest) would the eGFP be expressed.

But the mouse is homozygous for the construct, meaning both copies are in the genome. When they cross with SOX10-Cre, the Cre is active in neural crest cells. So in those cells, the stop cassettes should be removed, allowing eGFP expression. So in the offspring, the eGFP should be expressed in neural crest-derived cells, which are perhaps in the skin, or other regions. So when they look under the confocal, they should see green in those areas. But they don't.

Another possibility is that the eGFP isn't being properly trafficked. For example, if the receptor is retained in the ER, the eGFP might not get to the cell surface, but the Western would still detect the protein. Alternatively, the construct might have a mutation or something.

Looking at the options again.

Option D: receptor and eGFP are not in frame. If in the construct, the frame is wrong for eGFP, then the stop cassette removal wouldn't help. But if the frame is correct, then in the presence of Cre, eGFP would be expressed. If the frame is wrong, then the eGFP wouldn't be expressed even after Cre activation.

Wait, but in the plasmid transfection, the eGFP would have been expressed correctly, because the vector was transfected, so the construct would have been correctly expressed. So the frame should be correct.

Hmm. So another possibility is that the eGFP isn't being translated because of the stop cassette. But in the construct, the stop is after the receptor ORF. So without Cre, the stop would prevent eGFP. With Cre, the stop is removed, allowing eGFP to be expressed. If the mouse's Cre isn't working, the stop remains, preventing eGFP.

But they crossed to SOX10-Cre, so the Cre should be active in the right cells. Unless the Cre isn't active for some reason.

Wait, maybe the Cre isn't expressed in the mouse. But the SOX10-Cre is a well-established line, so that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the vector has both loxP and lox2272 sites, which require Cre for recombination. But if the Cre isn't active, the stop remains. But the offspring were supposed to have Cre.

Wait, another thought: The vector uses loxP and lox2272. These are different sites. Cre recognizes loxP, but what about lox2272? Wait, no. Lox2272 is a variant of loxP but requires Cre to excise. So in the presence of Cre, both loxP and lox2272 sites would be cut. So in the mouse, Cre would delete both stop cassettes, allowing both ligand-mCherry and receptor-eGFP to be expressed.

But maybe in the vector, the lox2272 is not correctly recognized by Cre, so the stop isn't removed. Or perhaps the lox sites are in the wrong orientation.

Alternatively, perhaps the stop cassettes are in the wrong place. For example, if the stop cassette is in the middle of the ORF, it would prevent expression. But the question says that the vector has the stop in between the ligand and mCherry. So when Cre is present, the stop is removed, allowing the ligand and mCherry to be expressed.

Wait, perhaps the eGFP is in the same reading frame as the receptor. If the eGFP is in frame, then the protein would be a fusion. If not, it would be out of frame. But in the plasmid, when they transfected, the eGFP was expressed, so the frame is correct.

Another possibility is that the IRES element for the receptor isn't working. If the IRES isn't functional, the receptor wouldn't be expressed even after Cre deletes the stop. But in the construct, the ligand is under CBA, which is strong, but the receptor is under IRES, which is weaker. So in the presence of Cre, the IRES may not be sufficient to drive expression of the receptor-eGFP.

Wait, but in the plasmid, the ligand and receptor are both expressed, so the IRES must be working in the transfected cells. Maybe in the mouse, due to other factors, the IRES isn't functioning.

Alternatively, perhaps the eGFP is not being translated because it's in the wrong reading frame. But that would have shown up in the Western blot.

Wait, perhaps the eGFP is being expressed but not fluorescing because it's not correctly folded. But that's less likely.

Another angle: the vector is bicistronic, so the same mRNA is used for both proteins. The ligand is first, then the IRES, then the receptor. But the stop cassettes are between the ligand and mCherry, and between the receptor and eGFP. So in the presence of Cre, ligand-mCherry and receptor-eGFP are both expressed.

But if the vector has the ligand and receptor in the same orientation, maybe the eGFP isn't being expressed because of an issue in the vector's design, such as lack of a promoter for the receptor. But the IRES should handle that.

Wait, the question says the ligand is under the CBA promoter. Then the receptor is after an IRES. So the mRNA is translated for the ligand, then the IRES allows the ribosome to translate the receptor.

But the presence of the stop cassettes complicates this. Without Cre, the stop cassettes prevent the downstream expression. When Cre is present, the stops are removed, so the mRNA can be translated for both ligand and receptor.

So in the mouse, when Cre is active, the ligand and receptor should be expressed, each with their fluorophores.

But in the experiment, the eGFP isn't showing up. So why?

Wait, the vector could have been inserted into a genomic area that's not expressed. Or perhaps the lox sites weren't correctly recognized, so the stops aren't removed.

Alternatively, perhaps the mouse is hemizygous for the construct. But the question says they're homozygous.

Wait, perhaps the problem is with the vector's design regarding the stop cassettes. The stop for the ligand is between ligand and mCherry, and the stop for the receptor is between receptor and eGFP. So when Cre deletes the stop, the ligand-mCherry is expressed and the receptor-eGFP is expressed.

But maybe in the mouse, the Cre isn't able to delete both stops. For example, if the vector doesn't have both loxP and lox2272 sites correctly positioned, the stops might not be excised. But the question says that the vector has loxP and lox2272 stops, so Cre should delete them.

Wait, but in the vector, the first stop is loxP, and the second is lox2272. Cre would recognize both, so both stops are removed. So the ligand-mCherry and receptor-eGFP should be expressed.

Another possibility: the eGFP is not expressed because the stop cassette wasn't removed. That could happen if the Cre isn't active. But the mice were crossed with SOX10-Cre, which is supposed to drive Cre expression in neural crest cells.

Wait, but maybe the expression of Cre is too low, so the stops aren't excised efficiently, leading to low expression of eGFP that isn't visible under the microscope.

Alternatively, perhaps the Western blot was done on the transfected cells, which are in culture, but in the mouse, the expression isn't happening because the construct isn't properly integrated. But the question states that the mouse is homozygous for the construct, which implies it's correctly integrated.

Wait, another thought: the enhancer for the ligand and receptor is missing. The construct uses CBA for the ligand and IRES for the receptor. But if the enhancer is missing, the CBA promoter might not be active. But CBA is a strong, constitutive promoter, so maybe it doesn't require enhancers. So option C is less likely.

Going back to the options, option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. If they're not, then even if the stop is removed, the eGFP wouldn't be expressed correctly. But in the Western blot, the construct was expressed, so the proteins should be in frame. So this is confusing.

Wait, perhaps the frame is correct, but the eGFP is not being translated because the reading frame shifts after the stop cassette. Or perhaps the eGFP is not in the correct frame relative to the receptor. So even when the stop is removed, the mRNA is translated but the eGFP isn't part of the protein. Therefore, the Western would detect the receptor but not the eGFP. But the question says the Western blot shows signals proportional to actin, implying that the proteins were detected. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the eGFP is not being translated because the frame is wrong, leading to a premature stop codon. So the receptor might be expressed, but the eGFP isn't. So the Western would pick up the receptor (as it's expressed) but not the eGFP.

But the question states that they raised antibodies against the overexpressed proteins. So if the eGFP isn't expressed, the antibody against the receptor may not detect it. Or perhaps the eGFP isn't present, so no signal.

Wait, but the problem is about the eGFP not showing up. So maybe the receptor isn't being expressed in the mouse for some reason.

Wait, another angle: the IRES might not be functional in the mouse. In some cases, IRES elements work better in certain species or cell types. If the IRES isn't functional, the receptor ORF isn't translated, even after Cre deletes the stop.

But in the plasmid, the IRES worked because the receptor was expressed. So why would it fail in the mouse? Maybe the expression context is different, like the presence of other promoters or elements.

Alternatively, perhaps the orientation of the IRES is wrong. If the IRES is in the wrong orientation, it might not drive the expression of the receptor.

Wait, the question says the receptor ORF is at the 3' and fused to eGFP. So the mRNA would have the ligand, then IRES, then receptor-eGFP. So the IRES should initiate translation of the receptor-eGFP.

If the IRES isn't working, the receptor wouldn't be expressed. So the eGFP wouldn't be expressed either. So the Western blot would show ligand-mCherry but not receptor-eGFP.

But in the plasmid, when transfected, both are expressed, so the IRES works in that context. So why would it not work in the mouse?

Maybe the vector's design doesn't allow for efficient IRES-driven expression in the mouse. So the receptor isn't expressed, hence no eGFP.

Alternatively, the problem is with the lox2272 site. If the lox2272 site isn't correctly recognized by Cre, the stop cassette remains, preventing eGFP expression. But lox2272 is a variant of loxP, so Cre should recognize it.

Wait, another possibility: the vector uses two different stop cassettes, loxP and lox2272. Cre can only delete one of them. But no, Cre can delete both sites if they are correctly placed.

Alternatively, perhaps the vector is not correctly excising the stop cassettes. For example, the loxP and lox2272 are in a configuration that doesn't allow Cre to delete both.

Wait, the loxP and lox2272 sites in the vector are arranged such that when Cre is present, both stops are excised. So the vector should allow both ORFs to be expressed.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Let me think about the possible options again.

If the mouse doesn't show green, possible reasons are:

- Cre isn't active, so stops remain. But they crossed with SOX10-Cre, which is active.

- The IRES isn't working, so receptor isn't expressed.

- The eGFP is not in frame, so even with Cre, it's not expressed.

- The enhancer is missing, so the promoter isn't active.

But option C says the enhancer is missing. The construct uses CBA for the ligand and IRES for the receptor. So without an enhancer, the CBA promoter might not be active. But CBA is a strong constitutive promoter, so maybe it doesn't require an enhancer.

Alternatively, perhaps the IRES requires an enhancer or other regulatory elements, which are missing.

Wait, no. IRES elements don't typically require enhancers; they drive expression internally. So if the IRES isn't working, the receptor wouldn't be expressed even after Cre deletes the stop. So maybe the IRES isn't functional in the construct.

But in the plasmid, the IRES worked because the receptor was expressed. So perhaps in the mouse, the IRES isn't working.

Alternatively, perhaps the vector is designed such that the IRES is only functional in certain cell types. But the question says the construct is initially expressed in neural crest cells, so the IRES should be functional in those cells.

Another thought: The eGFP is under the control of the lox2272 stop cassette. If the stop isn't removed, eGFP isn't expressed. But if the Cre isn't active in the cells where the construct is expressed, the stop remains.

Wait, but the Cre is SOX10-Cre, which is active in neural crest cells. So in those cells, the eGFP should be expressed.

But what if the construct isn't expressed in neural crest cells? But the construct is under CBA promoter, which is strong, so it should be expressed everywhere, including neural crest cells.

Wait, but the ligand and receptor are initially expressed in neural crest cells. So perhaps the construct is only active in neural crest cells. But the CBA promoter is constitutive, so it should be expressed in all cells.

Hmm. I'm going in circles here.

Let me think about the possible answer. The Western blot showed that the proteins were expressed when transfected, so the construct is functional. The problem is in the mouse, where the eGFP isn't expressed.

Option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. If that's the case, in the mouse, even after Cre deletes the stop, the eGFP wouldn't be expressed because the frame is wrong. But the Western would detect the receptor, but not the eGFP. But if the eGFP isn't expressed, the Western would show only the receptor band.

Wait, but the question states that the Western blot after plasmid transfection shows a signal proportional to actin. So the proteins were expressed in the transfected cells, implying that the frame is correct.

Hmm. I'm not seeing it. Maybe the correct answer is option C: the enhancer is missing. But how? The construct uses CBA, so maybe the enhancer is part of the CBA promoter.

Another possibility: the vector is designed such that the IRES is not functional because the correct transcription factors aren't present. But in the transfected cells, the IRES worked, but in the mouse, it doesn't.

Alternatively, perhaps the enhancer is missing for the receptor. For example, the CBA promoter drives the ligand, but the receptor is under IRES. If the IRES doesn't have the necessary enhancers, the receptor might not be expressed. But IRES elements typically don't require enhancers.

Wait, maybe the problem is that the eGFP is not being expressed because the stop cassette wasn't removed. That would mean the Cre isn't active, but the cross was with SOX10-Cre, which should be active.

Wait, another thought: the vector may have been inserted into a region that's subject to alternative splicing, which disrupts the expression. But that's more complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the vector has a transcriptional terminator after the stop cassette, preventing the expression of the receptor.

Wait, but the vector is designed so that when the stop is removed, the ORF is continuous. So if the stop is removed, the mRNA can be read through.

Hmm. Maybe the answer is option D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. Because if that's the case, the eGFP isn't expressed, and the Western blot would show the receptor but not the eGFP. But in the question, the Western blot after plasmid transfection would have the eGFP expressed, so that can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps the eGFP is being expressed, but it's not being detected because the antibody isn't working. But the question says the antibodies were raised against the overexpressed proteins, so they should detect them.

Alternatively, perhaps the expression level is too low to be detected under the microscope. But the question says the mouse is homozygous, so expression should be high.

I'm getting stuck. Let me think about each option again.

A) Ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship. That would mean they act on different cells, but the construct is designed to express both in the same cells where Cre is active. So this might not explain the lack of eGFP.

B) Receptor-eGFP is stuck in the Golgi. That would prevent surface expression, but the Western should still detect the protein. But the question only mentions fluorescence, not the Western.

C) Enhancer for the ligand and receptor is missing. Without an enhancer, the promoters might not function. But CBA is a strong promoter, so perhaps it doesn't need an enhancer.

D) Receptor and eGFP are not in frame. The Western would show the protein, but if the eGFP is not in frame, the construct would be truncated. But in the plasmid, the eGFP was expressed, so the frame must be correct.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that only the ligand is being expressed, not the receptor. So the eGFP isn't expressed because the receptor ORF isn't being translated. The reason could be that the IRES isn't working in the mouse, leading to no receptor expression.

But in that case, the eGFP wouldn't be expressed either. So in the Western, the eGFP might not show up. But the question says the Western after transfection worked, so the IRES was functional there.

Hmm. Maybe the issue is that the IRES isn't working in the mouse because of the genetic context. For example, the construct inserts into a region with strong transcriptional termination signals, interfering with the IRES.

Another possibility: the eGFP is inserted in the wrong direction. But the question says it's fused to the C-terminus, so it should be in the same direction.

Wait, perhaps the vector uses different start codons for the receptor in the mouse. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the lox2272 site isn't recognized by Cre, so the stop isn't removed for the receptor-eGFP. So the stop remains, preventing eGFP expression. But lox2272 should be recognized by Cre.

Wait, if the lox2272 site isn't correctly placed, the stop cassette wouldn't be removed. So the receptor-eGFP wouldn't be expressed. That would explain why the eGFP isn't visible.

But the question says the vector includes the lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette between the receptor ORF and eGFP. So if the lox2272 isn't recognized, the stop remains, preventing eGFP expression.

Wait, but Cre should recognize both loxP and lox2272 sites. So perhaps the lox2272 site isn't functional, meaning the stop isn't removed. But I thought lox2272 is a variant that Cre can recognize.

I'm not entirely sure, but perhaps the correct answer is option D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. But I'm not certain. Alternatively, option B could be possible if there's a trafficking issue, but the Western would still detect the protein.

Wait, I'm going to think about each option in terms of the setup.

Option D: The receptor and eGFP are not in frame. So when the stop is removed, the receptor is expressed, but the eGFP isn't because the frame doesn't allow it. So the eGFP wouldn't be produced. Thus, no fluorescence.

But in the plasmid, the eGFP is expressed, so the frame must be correct. So in the mouse, why would the frame be wrong?

Wait, perhaps during the cloning process, the eGFP was inserted out of frame. But the Western would have detected the receptor, perhaps. Or maybe the eGFP is inserted in frame, but the vector has an intron or something that shifts the frame. I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the vector uses a Kozak sequence or something that affects the initiation of translation in the mouse but not in the transfected cells. But that's more speculative.

Another thought: the eGFP is under the control of the lox2272 stop. If the stop isn't removed, the eGFP isn't expressed. If the lox2272 site isn't correctly recognized by Cre, the stop remains. But then why would the ligand-mCherry be expressed?

Wait, the ligand is under a loxP stop. If the loxP site is functional, the ligand-mCherry would be expressed, but the eGFP wouldn't if the lox2272 isn't functional.

So in the mouse, the ligand-mCherry would be expressed (as the loxP stop is removed), but the eGFP wouldn't be, because the lox2272 stop isn't removed.

But the question says that the mouse is homozygous for the construct, so both copies would have this issue.

If that's the case, then the ligand would be expressed but not the receptor. So the eGFP wouldn't be expressed.

But in the Western blot after transfection, the eGFP was expressed, meaning that in the plasmid, both lox sites were functional.

So perhaps in the mouse, the lox2272 site isn't recognized, so the receptor-eGFP isn't expressed.

But why would the lox2272 site not be recognized? I thought Cre can recognize both loxP and lox2272.

Wait, maybe the vector has the loxP and lox2272 sites arranged in a way that prevents Cre from deleting both. For example, if the lox sites are in opposite orientations, Cre might not be able to excise both.

But the question doesn't specify the orientation of the lox sites, so perhaps that's the issue.

Wait, if the lox2272 site isn't excised, the receptor-eGFP isn't expressed. So the eGFP isn't there, leading to no signal. But the ligand-mCherry would still be expressed if the loxP site was properly excised.

But the question says that in the offspring, they don't observe a green signal. So the eGFP isn't expressed. The ligand might be expressed, but the question is about eGFP.

So if the lox2272 site isn't excised, the eGFP isn't expressed. So the answer would relate to the lox2272 not being recognized.

But none of the options directly address this. The options are A to D as given.

Looking back, the only option related to expression is option C (enhancer missing) or D (not in frame).

Wait, another angle: the vector uses a bicistronic approach, so the expression of the receptor-eGFP is dependent on the IRES. If the IRES isn't functional, the receptor isn't expressed. But in the plasmid, the IRES worked.

But why would the IRES not work in the mouse?

Alternatively, perhaps the IRES is species-specific. But the plasmid was transfected into mouse cells, so it should work.

Hmm.

I'm going to have to make an educated guess here. I think the correct answer is D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. Because if they are out of frame, the eGFP isn't expressed, leading to no signal. But why would the frame be wrong in the mouse but correct in the plasmid? Maybe during cloning, the eGFP was inserted in the wrong frame for the mouse construct but correct for the plasmid. But that's a stretch.

Alternatively, perhaps the issue is that the IRES isn't working, so the receptor isn't expressed. But then, the eGFP wouldn't be expressed either. So why isn't the eGFP showing up?

Another thought: the eGFP is in the same frame as the receptor, but the stop cassette wasn't properly removed, so the eGFP isn't expressed. But then, the issue would be with the Cre not excising the stop, which should have happened.

Alternatively, perhaps the enhancer is missing. Without an enhancer, the CBA promoter isn't active, so the ligand isn't expressed either. But the question says the Western showed expression after transfection, so the promoter worked in vitro.

I'm getting stuck, but I think the most plausible option is D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. So when the stop is removed, the eGFP isn't translated because of a frameshift, leading to no fluorescence.

The question involves a genetic construct designed to study the interaction of a ligand-receptor pair expressed in neural crest cells. The construct is bicistronic, with the ligand ORF under the CBA promoter and the receptor ORF under an IRES element. The ligand is fused to mCherry, and the receptor is fused to eGFP, with stop cassettes flanked by loxP and lox2272 sites regulating their expression. The construct is excised in the presence of Cre recombinase, which is provided by SOX10-Cre mice. Despite successful Western blot detection of the proteins after plasmid transfection, no green signal corresponding to eGFP is observed in the offspring of mice homozygous for the construct.

### Analysis of the Options:

**A) Ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship**  
This option suggests that the ligand and receptor act on different cells. However, the construct is designed to co-express both proteins in the same cells where Cre is active. Since the eGFP signal is not observed, this does not explain the lack of fluorescence.  

**B) The receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi**  
If the receptor-eGFP were retained in the Golgi, it would not reach the cell surface, preventing fluorescence. However, the Western blot detected the protein, indicating that it is being synthesized. This suggests that the issue is not related to trafficking but rather to expression.  

**C) The enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing**  
The ligand is under the CBA promoter, which is a strong, constitutive promoter that does not typically require an enhancer. The receptor is under an IRES element, which also does not require enhancers for function. Since the plasmid successfully expressed both proteins in transfected cells, this option is unlikely.  

**D) The receptor and eGFP are not in frame**  
If the receptor and eGFP are not in frame, the eGFP would not be translated as part of the receptor fusion protein, even after the stop cassette is removed. This would result in no eGFP expression and no fluorescence. The Western blot detected the receptor, but not the eGFP, suggesting that the eGFP is either not expressed or not detected due to being out of frame. Given that the construct worked in transfected cells, the frame must have been correct in vitro, but issues in the mouse could arise during cloning or expression.  

### Conclusion:  
The most likely explanation is that the receptor and eGFP are not in frame, preventing eGFP expression and fluorescence in the mouse.
