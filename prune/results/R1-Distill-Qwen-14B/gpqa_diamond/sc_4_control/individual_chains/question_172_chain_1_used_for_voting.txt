Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

The question says that in star_1, iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh wait, I remember that in astrophysics, the excitation of atoms in a star's photosphere is related to the thermal energy of the star. Since the photospheres are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the distribution of atoms in different energy levels should follow the Boltzmann distribution.

Right, the Boltzmann equation relates the number of particles in two energy levels. The formula is something like n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k T) ), where g are the statistical weights, E is energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is temperature.

In this case, I'm told that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as those in star_2. So for each star, the ratio of excited to unexcited atoms (n_excited/n_base) would depend on their respective temperatures. Let me denote the energy difference between the two levels as ΔE = 1.38e-23 J. 

Wait, but wait. The problem mentions the energy difference was 1.38e-23 J. So for each star, the excitation ratio is governed by the Boltzmann factor. Let's denote the ratio for star_1 as R1 and star_2 as R2. So:

R1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )
R2 = (g2/g1) * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

But wait, the problem doesn't specify anything about the statistical weights (g2 and g1) for the energy levels. So I think we can assume that the statistical weights are the same for both stars, meaning that g2/g1 is the same for both. So the ratio R for each star would be proportional to exp( -ΔE/(k T) ) for each star.

But wait, the problem states that in star_1, the atoms are twice as excited as in star_2. Wait, that's a ratio of R1/R2 = 2? Or is it R1 = 2 R2? Because if R1 is the ratio for star 1, and R2 for star 2, then if star_1 is twice as excited, then R1 = 2 R2.

So, substituting the Boltzmann expressions:

R1 = (g2/g1) * exp(-ΔE/(k T1))
R2 = (g2/g1) * exp(-ΔE/(k T2))

Dividing R1 by R2, the (g2/g1) terms cancel out:

R1/R2 = exp( (-ΔE/(k T1)) - (-ΔE/(k T2)) )
= exp( ΔE/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) )

We know R1/R2 = 2, so:

2 = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Taking the natural logarithm on both sides:

ln(2) = (ΔE / k) (1/T2 - 1/T1 )

We can rearrange this equation to solve for the temperatures. Let's write it as:

ln(2) = (ΔE/k) [ (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ) ]

Wait, because 1/T2 - 1/T1 = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2). So that's correct.

So ln(2) = (ΔE/k) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

Hmm, but wait, the problem is asking which equation relating T1 and T2 is correct. So looking at the options, which one matches this structure.

Looking at the options:

Option D says ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)
Option A is ln(2) = T2/T1, which doesn't fit.
Option B is ln(2) = (T1+T2)/(T1 T2) — nope.
Option C has (T1-T2) over (T1 T2)^2 — no.
Option D: ln(2) = (T1-T2)/(T1 T2)

Wait, but our equation includes (ΔE/k), which isn't present in any of the options. Oh wait, the options don't have ΔE or k in them. So perhaps the options are assuming that (ΔE/k) is accounted for, and the equation they're showing is the result after that term is considered.

Wait, but that can't be right. Let me reevaluate. Because the equation I've derived includes (ΔE/k) multiplied by (T1 -T2)/(T1 T2).

But none of the options have any constants, so perhaps the question is considering the ratio of the two terms involving the temperatures, but then perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the question is simplifying by considering that ΔE/(k) is the same for both stars, but wait no, they're the same energy difference being considered for both stars.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. The question says that the energy difference is the same for both stars, so the (ΔE/k) term is a constant, say, let me call it a constant term C. So,

ln(2) = C * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

But the options don't include any constants other than the factors involving T1 and T2. So perhaps the given options represent the equation without the (ΔE/k) factor. Wait, that doesn't make sense because the options don't include the energy term.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read the question again.

The question states that the energy difference is about 1.38e-23 J. So that's a known value. But the options don't include any constants, so perhaps the given equation is the relation after considering that (ΔE/(k)) is a known value, but the problem is only focusing on the T1 and T2 relation.

Wait, but in the options, all the equations are in terms of T1 and T2. So perhaps the equation is ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) multiplied by some factor. But the options don't have any such factor, so perhaps that factor is 1, which would imply that (ΔE/k) = 1, but that's not necessarily the case.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the setup. Let me go back.

Wait, the problem says that the energy difference is 1.38e-23 J, but perhaps that's a red herring because the options don't involve ΔE. So perhaps the question is only about the form of the equation relating T1 and T2, regardless of constants.

Hmm, but I'm not sure. Let me think: the equation we have is ln(2) = (ΔE/k) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

But none of the options have any factors except for the temperature ratios. So perhaps the options are missing the (ΔE/k) factor, which would mean that the equation in option D is just ln(2) equals (T1-T2)/(T1 T2). But that would be incorrect because the correct equation includes the (ΔE/k) term.

Wait, but perhaps the question expects us to ignore the constants. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the ratio of R1 to R2 is 2, so let's write that again.

ln(R1/R2) = (ΔE)/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1 )

But R1 = 2 R2, so R1/R2 =2 → ln(2) = (ΔE/k) (1/T2 -1/T1 )

Wait, I think that's right. So 1/T2 - 1/T1 = (ln2) * k/(ΔE)

Wait, but the problem gives the equation for ln(2) in terms of T1 and T2. So the way I have it, ln(2) = (ΔE/k) * (1/T2 - 1/T1 )

Which can be rewritten as ln(2) = (ΔE/k) ( (T1 - T2) ) / (T1 T2 )

So that's the equation. Now, looking at the options:

Option D: ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

So, the option D would only be correct if (ΔE/k) is equal to 1. But since the given ΔE is 1.38e-23 J, and Boltzmann's constant k is about 1.38e-23 J/K, let me compute that.

Wait, k is approximately 1.38e-23 J/K. So ΔE is 1.38e-23 J → ΔE = k * T, where T is 1 K. So ΔE/(k) = T. So in this case, ΔE/k = (1.38e-23 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) ) = 1 K.

Wait, so if ΔE = k * T, then ΔE/(k) = T.

Wait, but wait, I'm not sure. Let me compute that. If ΔE is 1.38e-23 J, and k is 1.38e-23 J/K, then ΔE/k = (1.38e-23 J)/(1.38e-23 J/K) ) = 1 K.

So, in this problem, ΔE/(k) equals 1 K. So the equation becomes:

ln(2) = (1 K) * (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2 )

Which can be rewritten as:

ln(2) = (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2 )

So looking at the options, that's exactly option D. So the correct equation is option D.

The problem involves determining the relationship between the effective temperatures of two stars, \( T_1 \) and \( T_2 \), based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. The excitation levels follow the Boltzmann distribution, which relates the ratio of excited to unexcited atoms in two energy levels to the temperature of the system. The Boltzmann equation is:

\[
\frac{n_2}{n_1} = \frac{g_2}{g_1} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right),
\]

where \( g_2/g_1 \) is the ratio of statistical weights, \( \Delta E \) is the energy difference between the levels, \( k \) is Boltzmann's constant, and \( T \) is the temperature. For the two stars, the excitation ratios are:

\[
R_1 = \frac{n_{\text{excited}}}{n_{\text{base}}} \propto \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right),
\]
\[
R_2 = \frac{n_{\text{excited}}}{n_{\text{base}}} \propto \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right).
\]

The problem states that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as those in star_2, so \( R_1 / R_2 = 2 \). Dividing the two equations and taking the natural logarithm gives:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right).
\]

Rewriting \( \frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} \) as \( \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} \), the equation becomes:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{\Delta E}{k} \cdot \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

Given that \( \Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \) and \( k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K} \), the ratio \( \Delta E / k = 1 \, \text{K} \). Substituting this into the equation simplifies it to:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

This matches the form of option D. The other options can be ruled out as follows:
- **Option A**: \( \ln(2) = \frac{T_2}{T_1} \) does not match the derived equation.
- **Option B**: \( \ln(2) = \frac{T_1 + T_2}{T_1 T_2} \) is incorrect because the derived equation involves \( T_1 - T_2 \), not \( T_1 + T_2 \).
- **Option C**: \( \ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{(T_1 T_2)^2} \) is incorrect because the denominator is squared, which does not match the derived equation.

Thus, the correct equation is:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]
