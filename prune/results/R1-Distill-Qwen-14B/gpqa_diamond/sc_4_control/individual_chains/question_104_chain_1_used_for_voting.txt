Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again carefully.

The question is about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Both stars have the same mass as the Sun, and each has a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. The planets are in circular orbits. 

The RV method detects planets by measuring the Doppler shift in the star's spectral lines caused by the planet's gravitational pull. The star moves back and forth, and the spectral lines shift as the star moves towards or away from us. 

So, for Planet #1, the periodic shift is 5 milliangstroms. For Planet #2, it's 7 milliangstroms. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1.

Hmm. I remember that the RV method's observed velocity shift (which is related to the wavelength shift) is connected to the mass of the planet and the orbital period. But wait, how exactly?

I think the RV method's measured velocity amplitude (K) is given by the formula:

K = ( (G * (M_planet) ) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) * (P * (1 - e²)^(3/2)) ) )^(1/1) ) * (1 / (2π))

Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula. Alternatively, I remember that the semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_planet / M_star) * (1 / (P^(1/3))) ) / (something else...? Or maybe it's more precise to think about the Doppler shift in terms of the star's velocity.

Wait, actually, the formula for the semi-amplitude of the radial velocity is:

K = (v) = ( (2πG) / (c P) )^(1/3) * (M_planet sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) )

But since the planet mass is much smaller than the star's mass (Neptune is much less than the Sun), M_star + M_planet ≈ M_star. So the formula simplifies to:

K ≈ ( (2πG) / (c P) )^(1/3) * (M_planet / M_star^(2/3) )

But wait, M_planet and M_star are in the same proportion for both planets. Wait, the problem says both planets have masses similar to Neptune, and both stars are similar to the Sun. So M_planet is about the same for both, and M_star (the host stars) are the same too. So M_planet / M_star^(2/3) is the same for both planets.

So, the ratio of their K values (the velocity semi-amplitudes) should depend on 1/(P^(1/3)). Because:

K ∝ (1 / P^(1/3)) )

But in the problem, it's the wavelength shift that's given. Wait, the RV method measures the velocity of the star, which causes the Doppler shift. The Doppler shift (Δλ) is related to the velocity by the formula:

Δλ / λ₀ = v / c

Where λ₀ is the rest wavelength, v is the velocity, and c is the speed of light.

But since the same spectral line is used for both stars, the rest wavelength λ₀ is the same for both. So the ratio of the velocity semi-amplitudes (K) is the same as the ratio of the Doppler shifts (Δλ). So:

K1 / K2 = Δλ1 / Δλ2 = 5 / 7.

Wait, wait, no. Because K is the velocity semi-amplitude, and Δλ is proportional to K. So K1 = (Δλ1) * c / λ0, and K2 = (Δλ2) * c / λ0. So K1/K2 = Δλ1 / Δλ2 = 5/7.

So K1/K2 = 5/7.

Earlier, I found that K ∝ 1/(P^(1/3)).

So,

K1 / K2 = (1/P1^(1/3)) / (1/P2^(1/3)) ) = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

Wait, let me make sure. Let's write K as proportional to 1/(P^(1/3)).

So, K1 = C / P1^(1/3)

K2 = C / P2^(1/3)

Where C is a constant that includes all other factors (which are same for both planets, since M_planet and M_star are same, and other terms are same).

So,

K1/K2 = (C / P1^(1/3)) ) / (C / P2^(1/3)) ) = (P2 / P1)^(1/3)

But we know that K1/K2 = 5/7.

So,

( P2 / P1 )^(1/3) = 5/7

Wait, no, because K1 is 5, K2 is 7. So K1/K2 is 5/7.

So,

( P2/P1 )^(1/3) = 5/7

Wait, but wait, how is that possible? Because 5/7 is less than 1, so P2/P1 would be (5/7)^3 = 125/343 ≈ 0.364. So P2 is shorter than P1, meaning Planet #2's period is shorter than Planet #1's by a factor of about 0.364.

But the question is asking how many times longer is Planet #2's period than Planet #1's. So that would be P2 / P1 = (5/7)^3 ≈ 0.364. So P2 is about 0.36 times P1, meaning it's about 1/3 the period. So the period of planet #2 is 0.36 times as long as planet #1's period. So planet #2's period is shorter.

Wait, but the question says: "How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?"

So if P2 = 0.36 P1, then P2 is 0.36 times as long as P1. So the orbital period of planet #2 is shorter, not longer.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I mixed up the ratio.

Wait, let me re-express.

We have K1 = 5, K2=7. So K1/K2 = 5/7.

From earlier: K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

So,

(5/7) = (P2 / P1)^(1/3)

Cube both sides:

(5/7)^3 = P2/P1

So P2 = P1 * (5/7)^3

Which is P2 = (125/343) P1 ≈ 0.364 P1.

So P2 is about 0.364 times P1. So P2 is shorter than P1 by a factor of ~0.364.

So the period of Planet #2 is 0.36 times that of Planet #1. So how many times longer is P2 than P1? It's 0.36 times as long, so it's shorter. So the answer would be approximately 0.36. So looking at the options, option A is ~0.36.

Wait, but let me double-check. Because sometimes these ratios can be tricky.

Wait, the question is: How many times longer is P2 than P1?

So P2 = 0.36 * P1 → P2 is 36% of P1. So it's shorter, not longer. So the factor is 0.36.

Looking back at the options:

A) ~0.36 → So the orbital period of planet #2 is 0.36 times as long as planet #1, meaning it's shorter. But the question is asking how many times longer Planet #2 is than Planet #1. So the answer would be approximately 0.36. So option A is correct.

Wait, but sometimes when I read the question, perhaps I got it wrong. Let's check.

Question: How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?

So, the ratio is P2 / P1. If P2 is smaller, then P2/P1 is less than 1, so the period is shorter. So the answer is approximately 0.36 times. So the period of planet #2 is 0.36 times as long as that of planet #1. So how many times longer? 0.36 times, which is the same as 36% the length. So it's shorter, not longer.

So the answer would be A) ~0.36.

The problem involves determining how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1, given that both planets are detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. The RV method measures the Doppler shift of the star's spectral lines caused by the gravitational pull of the planet. The wavelength shifts for Planet #1 and Planet #2 are 5 milliangstroms and 7 milliangstroms, respectively.

The RV semi-amplitude \( K \) is proportional to \( \frac{1}{P^{1/3}} \), where \( P \) is the orbital period. Since the stars and planets have similar masses, the ratio of the semi-amplitudes is equal to the ratio of the wavelength shifts:

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \frac{\Delta \lambda_1}{\Delta \lambda_2} = \frac{5}{7}.
\]

From the proportionality \( K \propto \frac{1}{P^{1/3}} \), we have:

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right)^{1/3}.
\]

Substituting \( \frac{K_1}{K_2} = \frac{5}{7} \), we get:

\[
\left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right)^{1/3} = \frac{5}{7}.
\]

Cubing both sides:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3 = \frac{125}{343} \approx 0.364.
\]

Thus, the orbital period of Planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of Planet #1. Since the question asks how many times longer Planet #2's period is compared to Planet #1, the answer is approximately 0.36.
