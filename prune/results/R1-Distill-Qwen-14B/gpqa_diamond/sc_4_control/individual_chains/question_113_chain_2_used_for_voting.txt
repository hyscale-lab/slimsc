Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about identifying an unknown compound using various spectroscopy techniques. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step. Let me read the question again.

The compound is characterized using FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The FTIR has a very broad peak around 3000 cm^-1. Broad peaks in IR usually indicate O-H groups, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. Then there are two strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. I remember that carbonyl groups (C=O) typically absorb around 1700 cm^-1. The 1650 might be another carbonyl, maybe an ester or conjugated something. Or perhaps it's something else, like an aromatic ring with conjugated double bonds?

The 1H NMR shows peaks for vinyl hydrogens, so that means there are double bonds with adjacent protons—like in an alkene. So the molecule has some sort of unsaturated structure. 

Mass spec shows a fragment peak at m/z 45. Hmm, 45 is a common mass. Let me think: 45 could be C3H7O (like maybe a methyl group with some oxygen, or a fragment like a ketone or ester. Wait, wait, 45 is the molecular ion of methyl isocyanate? No, that's more like 44. Alternatively, maybe it's a fragment that's a CH2O group or something. Or perhaps the m/z 45 is a carbonyl-containing fragment.

Let me go through each technique to gather clues.

Starting with the FTIR. The broad peak around 3000 cm^-1 suggests an O-H stretch. So the compound has either an alcohol group (-OH) or maybe a carboxylic acid. But carboxylic acids usually have a broader O-H peak and maybe a peak around 2500-3300 for the O-H. Wait, the question says very broad, which I think is more indicative of an O-H group, maybe an alcohol or a carboxylic acid.

The 1700 cm^-1 peak is probably a carbonyl, like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe an acid. Since there's another peak at 1650, which is a bit lower. Maybe it's an ester or maybe conjugated carbonyl. Wait, 1650 is around where conjugated carbonyls (like in an alpha, beta-unsaturated ketone) might show up. Alternatively, maybe it's an aromatic ring with a carbonyl group, like an aromatic ester or something.

Wait, but the NMR has vinyl hydrogens. So there's an alkene in the molecule. So maybe the compound has both a carbonyl and an alkene. So maybe it's an ester with a double bond, or a ketone with a double bond, or an acid with a double bond.

Looking at the possible formulas: the options are C6H12O, C6H10O, C6H10O2, C6H12O2.

Wait, let me calculate the degrees of unsaturation for each.

Degrees of Unsaturation formula: Degrees = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no halogens or N here.

Option A: C6H12O2. So C=6, H=12, O=2. X=0, N=0.

Degrees = (2*6 +2 -12 -0 +0)/2 = (14-12)/2=2/2=1. So one degree of unsaturation. That could be a ring or a double bond. But wait, the NMR has vinyl hydrogens, so at least one double bond. So if it's one degree, maybe a double bond and an ester (if O is from an ester). Wait, but if O is from an ester, that's two oxygen atoms (O2). Wait, the formula is C6H12O2. For esters, the formula is RCOOR', so the O count would be two. 

Option B: C6H10O. So C=6, H=10, O=1.

Degrees: (2*6+2 -10)/2= (14-10)/2=4/2=2. So two degrees: could be a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds, etc.

Option C: C6H10O2. So, (2*6+2 -10 -0)/2 = (14-10)/2=2. So two degrees.

Option D: C6H12O. (2*6+2 -12)/2= (14-12)/2=1. So one double bond or ring.

But the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, so at least one double bond. So in option D, with one degree of unsaturation, that could be a double bond. But what about the IR? We have O-H and two carbonyls? Wait, the IR has two strong peaks, at 1700 and 1650. So that suggests two carbonyl groups.

Wait, but in option B (C6H10O), that's only one O. So if there are two carbonyls, that's two O's. So that can't be. So options with O=2 are A and C.

So looking back: the IR has two carbonyl peaks. So two carbonyl groups. So the compound must have two O-containing functional groups, each with a carbonyl. Or maybe one carbonyl and another group.

Wait, but two strong peaks at 1700 and 1650. Hmm. Let me think about the possible functional groups.

Two carbonyl peaks could mean two different types of carbonyl groups. For example, an ester (around 1700) and a ketone (around 1700 as well, but maybe a conjugated ketone would be lower, like 1650). Or perhaps a conjugated carbonyl like in an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester, where the carbonyl is at 1700 and maybe a conjugated double bond at 1650? Or maybe one is a ketone and the other is an ester or maybe an acid.

Wait, but the presence of O-H in the IR suggests a hydroxyl group. So perhaps the compound is an ester with a hydroxyl group, but that seems conflicting. Alternatively, maybe it's a bicyclic compound with a conjugated system, but that's less likely.

Wait, another thought: maybe the two peaks are for an ester and a carbonyl group in a conjugated system. Like an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester. In such a case, the carbonyl (ester) would be around 1700, and the conjugated double bond might have a peak around 1650. Alternatively, the 1650 could be an aromatic ring. But wait, the NMR has vinyl hydrogens, which are protons on a double bond, so that suggests an alkene, not necessarily an aromatic ring.

Wait, but if the molecule has an aromatic ring, then the NMR would show aromatic protons, but the question says the NMR includes peaks for vinyl hydrogens. So, maybe it's an alkene, not an aromatic ring. So perhaps it's a diene.

But let me focus on the possible formulas again.

Possible options with two O's: A (C6H12O2) and C (C6H10O2).

For each, what would their structures look like?

Option A: C6H12O2. Degrees of unsaturation is 1. So either a ring or a double bond. But since the NMR has vinyl protons, must have a double bond. So one degree is the double bond, but that would mean the rest is a single bond. Wait, but then where are the other O's? If it's an ester, for example, the formula would be RCOOR', which for an ester of a carboxylic acid. Let's say if it's a cyclic ester, like a lactone, but that doesn't necessarily add more O's.

Wait, maybe the structure has a carbonyl group (like an ester) and an O-H group. So, for example, a compound like a cyclohexene ring with an ester substituent and an alcohol group. Wait, but that would require more carbons.

Alternatively, maybe the compound is something like a diethyl ester, but that would require more O's.

Wait, perhaps the structure is methyl vinyl ether or something similar. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe it's an ester with a hydroxyl group. But that seems unlikely because that would require more O's. Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclic ester, but that's a lactone, which requires a ring and an ester.

Wait, let's think about the molecular formula. For option A, C6H12O2. The molecular formula for an ester would be RCOOR', which would have O2. The molecular formula for a simple ester like methyl propanoate is C4H8O2. So for C6H12O2, perhaps it's a larger ester or something else. Alternatively, maybe it's a diester, but that would require more O's.

Wait, perhaps the compound is an ester with a double bond. For example, an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester. That would have a conjugated double bond. So the IR would show the ester carbonyl at ~1700 and the conjugated double bond (maybe a C=C) at ~1650. But wait, the C=C in IR typically shows up around 1650 as well. But the peak at 1650 in the IR could also be a carbonyl group, perhaps in a conjugated system.

But the question's IR shows two strong peaks at 1700 and 1650. So, perhaps two different carbonyl groups, like an ester and a ketone. But wait, that would require two O's as in O2, which is option A or C.

Alternatively, maybe one is a carbonyl and the other is a conjugated double bond. But the 1650 peak is more likely a carbonyl than a double bond, since the question says the 1H NMR has vinyl hydrogens, indicating a C=C, so the IR's 1650 peak could be something else. Wait, but the 1650 might be an aromatic ring's C=C, but the NMR suggests an alkene, not necessarily aromatic. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe it's an acid derivative. But the O-H in IR suggests maybe a hydroxyl group. So perhaps the compound is an ester with an alcohol group. But that would require more O's than present in the formula.

Wait, maybe the O's are from a ketone and an ester. Let's think: if the formula is C6H10O2, that would have two degrees of unsaturation. So that could be a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds, etc.

Another approach: look at the mass spec. The fragment is at m/z 45. What's 45? Let's see: molecular weight of 45 is C3H7O (since 3*12 +7*1 +16= 36+7+16=60? No, that's 60. Wait, 45 is 3*(12) + 1*(16) + (1*1) * something else? Wait, 45 is 3 carbons: 3*12=36, then 45-36=9, which could be 9 as O (16) doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe C3H3O? But 3*12 +3*1 +16=36+3+16=55. Hmm, so maybe it's a fragment like CO (28) and something else. Alternatively, perhaps it's a CH2O group, which is formaldehyde (but that's 30). Or maybe it's a CH3CO (43) plus something else. Alternatively, maybe it's the loss of a fragment.

Wait, another angle: the molecular formula of the unknown. Let's calculate the molecular weight based on each formula.

Option A: C6H12O2. MW = (6*12)+(12*1)+(2*16)=72+12+32=116.

Option B: C6H10O. 6*12=72 +10*1=10 +16=16. Total 72+10+16=98.

Option C: C6H10O2. 6*12=72, 10*1=10, 2*16=32. Total 72+10+32=114.

Option D: C6H12O. 6*12=72, 12*1=12, 16=16. 72+12+16=100.

The mass spec shows a fragment at m/z 45. So if the molecular ion is, say, 114 (option C) or 116 (option A), then 114 minus 45 is 69. But what would that indicate? Or maybe the fragment is a piece of the molecule, like losing a group.

Wait, if the molecular weight is 114 (option C), then a fragment of 45 could be a part of the molecule. Let's see: 45 is perhaps a CH2O group (formaldehyde is 30, CH3OH is 32). Or maybe it's a COO group, but that's 44. Hmm.

Alternatively, 45 could be from (CH3)2O, which is 31. Not quite. Wait, maybe it's a methyl group attached to something else. Alternatively, maybe it's a loss of a larger fragment, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: what is the molecular formula of the fragment at m/z 45? 45 could be C3H7O. Let's see: 3*12=36, 7*1=7, 16=16. 36+7=43, plus 16 is 59. No, that's too much. Alternatively, maybe it's C3H3O2? 3*12=36, 3*1=3, 2*16=32. 36+3+32=71. No. Alternatively, maybe it's C2H3O2: 24 +3 +32=59. No.

Wait, perhaps the 45 is a carbonyl-containing fragment. Like a ketone or aldehyde. The molecular weight would be 45 for a fragment. Let's think: 45 could be CH3CO (43) plus a hydrogen? Or maybe it's CH3CO-O something. Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a fragment from an ester group.

Wait, another thought: the mass spectrum's fragment at m/z 45. Another common fragment is the tropylium ion (C7H7+), but that's 91. Not applicable here.

Alternatively, m/z 45 could be CH3COOH (but that's 60). Or perhaps it's a smaller piece, like the loss of a larger group.

Another approach: let's consider the possible structures for each option.

Option C: C6H10O2. Degrees of unsaturation is 2. So two rings, a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds.

If the structure has a double bond and an ester group, that would fit the NMR (vinyl H) and the IR (ester and possibly another carbonyl? Or maybe a conjugated system.

Wait, but the IR has two carbonyl peaks: 1700 and 1650. So maybe two carbonyls. If the molecule is an ester with a ketone, but that would require more O's. Alternatively, perhaps one of the O's is from an ester and the other from an alcohol, but that would only give one carbonyl.

Alternatively, maybe the compound has an ester and an alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyl. For example, an ester with a conjugated double bond next to a carbonyl. So, the ester carbonyl is at 1700, and the conjugated double bond's carbonyl is lower at 1650. Hmm, but in conjugated systems, the carbonyl peak might be downshifted.

Wait, but the presence of vinyl hydrogens in the NMR suggests a double bond. So, maybe we have an ester group and a conjugated double bond, which might explain the IR peaks. But that would mean one carbonyl (ester) and another from the conjugated double bond. Not sure about that.

Alternatively, maybe the compound is a cyclic ketone ester, but I'm not sure.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about the options again.

Option A: C6H12O2. Degrees of unsaturation is 1, which could be a ring or a double bond. But since we have a vinyl group in the NMR, it's a double bond. So that would account for one degree. The other O is perhaps an ester group. So maybe the structure is something like a cyclohexene ring with an ester substituent. But I'm not sure.

Option C: C6H10O2. Degrees of unsaturation is 2. So perhaps a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds. If it's a ring and a double bond, then maybe the structure is a cyclic ester (lactone) with a double bond. Or maybe a benzene ring with an ester group, but that would require more O's.

Wait, but the NMR has vinyl hydrogens, not aromatic, so maybe it's an alkene. So perhaps the structure is an ester with a double bond. Let's say structure like CH2=CHCOOR, but that would have more carbons.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is an orthoester or something else, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: the IR shows a broad peak at 3000, which is O-H. So the molecule has an -OH group. So one of the oxygen atoms is from an alcohol or carboxylic acid. But since the IR has another strong peak at 1700, which is a carbonyl, perhaps it's an ester. So O from ester and O from alcohol? But that would require O2, which is in options A and C.

So for option C (C6H10O2), that would have O from an alcohol and an ester. So structure could be something like a diol ester or maybe an ester with a hydroxyl group.

Wait, but how would that fit the IR? The broad O-H would be from the alcohol. The 1700 would be from the ester. The 1650 peak—what would that be? Another carbonyl group? So perhaps the compound has both an ester and a ketone. But that would require O2, but the formula only has O2, which is okay (ester has O2).

Wait, but then the IR would have three peaks: O-H, two carbonyls. But the question says two strong peaks at 1700 and 1650, plus a broad O-H. So maybe the two strong are two carbonyls, and the broad is the O-H. So the compound has both an ester and a ketone.

But how would that fit into the molecular formula? Let's see: the compound would have an ester group (RCOOR') which contributes O2, and a ketone group (RCOR'') which is another O. Wait, that would require O3, but our options have O2. So that's not possible. So perhaps only one carbonyl group, but then why two peaks in IR?

Hmm, perhaps the two peaks are from the same group. Maybe the 1700 is from an ester, and the 1650 is from a conjugated double bond. So the C=C is conjugated to the ester, leading to a lower wavenumber for the ester's carbonyl? Or maybe the 1650 is from a carbonyl group in a different environment.

Alternatively, maybe the 1650 is from an aromatic ring, but the NMR doesn't indicate aromatic protons, only vinyl.

Wait, perhaps the compound is an orthoester or something with conjugated carbonyls.

Hmm, perhaps looking at the Mass Spec fragment. If the molecular formula is C6H10O2 (option C), and the molecular weight is 114, then the fragment at 45 would be (114-45=69). Not sure what that signifies. Alternatively, the fragment could be a part of the molecule, like a CH3CO group (43) plus something else. But 43 plus 2 would be 45, but that doesn't seem right.

Wait, 45 could be the molecular ion of a smaller molecule. For example, if the compound is an ester of some sort, perhaps the m/z 45 is the loss of a larger group. Alternatively, maybe it's a cleavage product.

Wait, another thought. The molecular formula for the fragment is 45. Let's think about possible structures. 45 could be C3H7O (which is 3*12 +7 +16= 36+7+16=60? No, that's 59. Wait, 3 carbons: 36. 45-36=9. So 9 could be H and O. 9= 16*0.56 (no, that doesn't make sense). Alternatively, maybe it's CH2O (formaldehyde is 30). Or perhaps it's a CH3 group with more oxygen.

Alternatively, 45 could be (CH3)2CO (acetone is 58). No. Hmm, I'm stuck on this.

Maybe I should think about the possible structures for each option and see which fits all the data.

Option A: C6H12O2. Suppose it's an ester with a double bond. Like methyl cyclohex-2-ene-carboxylate. The IR would show the ester carbonyl at ~1700, and the double bond would have a peak in the IR around 1650. The NMR would show vinyl Hs. The O-H in the IR suggests an alcohol group, but wait, the formula doesn't have enough O for that. Wait, no: option A is O2. So maybe it's an ester with an alcohol, but that's O3? No, not possible. So perhaps the O-H is from an acidic protons, but that would require more O's.

Wait, perhaps the O-H isn't from an alcohol but from a carboxylic acid. But that would require O2. So, if the compound is a carboxylic acid with another group. But I'm not sure.

Option C: C6H10O2. Let's think of a possible structure. Maybe it's an ester with a double bond. For example, methyl vinyl benzoate, but that would have more O's. Alternatively, maybe an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester. For example, something like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH2CH3. Wait, but that's more than six carbons. Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclic ester with a double bond. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a structure like cyclopentene with an ester substituent. For example, cyclopentene ring with an ester group. Then, the IR would show the ester carbonyl and maybe a conjugated double bond.

In that case, the IR peaks would be at 1700 (ester) and 1650 (C=C). The O-H peak is broad at 3000, but wait, if it's an ester and a cyclopentene, where is the O-H coming from? Unless there's an alcohol group elsewhere, but that would require O2.

Wait, maybe the compound is a diester. But diesters would have more O's. Alternatively, maybe it's a hemiacetal or something else. I'm getting a bit stuck.

Wait, the IR's 3000 cm^-1 is a very broad peak, which is more indicative of an O-H group, perhaps in a carboxylic acid. But I'm not sure.

Another approach: the IR shows two strong absorption peaks at 1700 and 1650, which are both in the carbonyl region. So the compound must have two carbonyl groups. So the formula must have at least two O's. Which leaves options A, C, and possibly others.

Wait, but option B is C6H10O, which has only one O. So it can't have two carbonyl groups, so we can eliminate options B and D, because their O count is insufficient for two carbonyl groups.

Wait, that's a good point. Because the FTIR shows two strong peaks in the carbonyl region, that suggests two carbonyl groups. So the compound must have at least two oxygen atoms, one for each carbonyl. Therefore, among the options, only A (C6H12O2), C (C6H10O2), and possibly others have O2 or more. So options B (O=1) and D (O=1) are eliminated because they can't have two carbonyl groups.

So now the options are A and C.

Between A and C, the molecular formula is either C6H12O2 or C6H10O2.

Now, looking at the degree of unsaturation.

Option A: C6H12O2. Degrees of unsaturation is 1. So one ring or one double bond.

Option C: C6H10O2. Degrees of unsaturation is 2. So two rings, one ring and one double bond, or two double bonds.

The 1H NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, so a double bond is present. So both options have at least one double bond.

But option A has a degree of unsaturation of 1, so only one double bond (or a ring). Option C has a degree of 2, so either two rings, a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds.

So the presence of vinyl hydrogens indicates a double bond, so for option A, the other degree is a ring or another double bond? No, because the degrees are calculated as (2C+2 - H - X +N)/2. So for option A, the other unsaturation is the double bond. So if it's a double bond and another ring, but that would require more than one degree.

Wait, I think I messed up. Degrees of unsaturation for option A: 1. So it could be either a ring or a double bond, but not both. But wait, the compound has a double bond (from the NMR), so the other must be a ring.

So, if option A is C6H12O2, then it has a ring and a double bond. But wait, the NMR shows vinyl H, indicating a double bond, so the ring plus double bond would account for two degrees of unsaturation. But option A only has one. So that can't be. Therefore, option A can't be correct because it would require two degrees of unsaturation but only has one.

Wait, that's confusing. Let me recalculate the degrees for option A.

Wait, option A: C6H12O2.

Degrees of unsaturation = (2*6 +2 -12)/2 = (14-12)/2=1.

So one degree: either a ring or a double bond. But the NMR shows a double bond (vinyl H), so the other degree must come from another structure.

Wait, that can't be. So, if option A is the formula, it has one degree of unsaturation, which is a double bond (since the NMR shows that), but then the other O's must be part of an ester or something else. But with only one degree, that's not possible. Wait, perhaps the ring is part of another functional group.

Wait, maybe the compound is a cyclic ester (lactone). So a six-membered ring with an ester linkage. That would contribute one ring (one degree) and any double bonds would add more. But if option A has only one degree, then the ring is the only one, but then the double bond would require another degree, which isn't possible. So option A can't have both a ring and a double bond because that would require two degrees.

So that leaves option C: C6H10O2.

Degrees of unsaturation is 2. So two degrees can account for either two rings, one ring and one double bond, or two double bonds.

The NMR shows vinyl H, so a double bond is present, contributing one degree. The other degree could be from another double bond or a ring. So the structure could have a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds.

Now, the IR shows two carbonyl peaks. So, perhaps the structure has two ester groups? Or an ester and another carbonyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps it's an ester and a ketone, but that would require more O's.

Wait, but the formula is C6H10O2, so two O's. So, for two carbonyl groups, each would need an O. So, perhaps it's an ester (which has O2) and another carbonyl, but that would require three O's. Wait, no. Wait, ester has two O's, so if the molecule is a cyclic ester (lactone), which has O2. Then where is the other carbonyl in the IR?

Hmm, I'm getting stuck again.

Wait, perhaps the compound is a cyclic ester with a conjugated double bond. So, the ester carbonyl is at 1700, and the conjugated double bond's C=C might have a peak around 1650. But wait, the C=C in IR usually appears around 1650, but isn't that a separate peak from the carbonyl?

Alternatively, maybe the 1650 peak is from a conjugated carbonyl, like in a keto group adjacent to a double bond.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a bicyclic compound, but that might complicate things.

Alternatively, maybe the compound is a diester, but that would require more O's.

Wait, another thought: the broad O-H peak in the IR could be from a carbonyl group, but that's not likely. Alternatively, perhaps it's a cyclic ester (lactone) with an adjacent hydroxyl group. But that would require O2: one O from the ester and another from the OH. Wait, that would sum up to O2.

So structure: a cyclic ester (lactone) with a hydroxyl group nearby. But in that case, the IR would show the ester carbonyl at 1700, the O-H of the hydroxyl as a broad peak, and maybe another peak from the ring's conjugation or something else.

Wait, but the IR shows two strong peaks at 1700 and 1650. So that suggests two carbonyl groups. So perhaps it's a lactone (one carbonyl) and another carbonyl group. But then the O count would be O3, which isn't the case here (O2). So that can't be.

Hmm, maybe I should think about the mass spec again. The fragment at 45 could be a carbonyl-containing group. For example, the (CH3)2CO (acetone, m/z 58) isn't it. Or maybe it's a fragment from the ester group.

Wait, what's the molecular weight of a methyl group (15) plus something else. No, that's not helpful. Alternatively, maybe the fragment is a CH2O group (formaldehyde, 30), but 45 is higher.

Wait, if the molecular formula is C6H10O2, and the fragment is at 45, maybe it's losing a larger group. For example, losing C3H6O (which would have a molecular weight of 58 [3*12 +6 +16=36+6+16=58]). So 114 (C6H10O2) minus 58 is 56, which isn't 45. Alternatively, perhaps the molecular ion is at 114, and the fragment is 45, which would suggest losing 69. Not sure.

Another approach: perhaps the fragment at 45 is a CH2O group plus a CH3 group. Or maybe it's a (CH2CH2O) group, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the fragment is the acylium ion. For example, CH3CO+ is 43, which is close to 45. Maybe with an extra proton or something. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is a ketene ion, but I don't know.

Hmm. Maybe I should think about the possible functional groups again.

Given that the FTIR has a broad O-H, which suggests an alcohol or carboxylic acid. But the presence of two carbonyl peaks suggests two carbonyl groups. So perhaps the compound is a diacid, but that would require O4, which isn't present.

Alternatively, a cyclic anhydride, which has two carbonyl groups but would be O3, which is again not present.

Wait, perhaps the compound is a beta-keto ester. Beta-keto esters have two carbonyl groups: one from the ester and another from the ketone. So the structure would be something like RCOCOR', which has two carbonyls. So the IR would show peaks for both. That would fit the two carbonyl peaks.

The formula for a beta-keto ester would be RCO-COR'. Let's say R is CH2CH2 and R' is CH2CH2, but that's not adding up to six carbons. Let's see: the beta-keto ester has the structure (CH2)xC(O)C(O)OR'. So perhaps the formula would be C5H8O2 (if R is CH2CH2CH2 and R' is CH3). But that's not matching any of the options.

Wait, if the molecular formula is C6H10O2 (option C), perhaps it's a beta-keto ester with a double bond. For example, something like CH2=CH-CO-COOR. But that might not fit exactly.

Wait, maybe the structure is a beta-keto ester with a six-membered ring. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the compound is a diester with a conjugated double bond, but I'm not sure.

Hmm. Maybe I should look for other clues.

The 1H NMR has peaks for vinyl hydrogens, so the double bond is likely in a trans or cis configuration, but that doesn't help much.

The mass spec fragment at 45 could be a CH3CO+ (43) plus some, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, if the molecular formula is C6H10O2, and the molecular weight is 114, the possible loss could be a fragment of 45 and another of 69. But I'm not sure what that signifies.

Wait, another thought: the molecular formula C6H10O2 has a molecular weight of 114. The fragment at 45 is exactly 114 - 69. But 69 is the molecular weight of something else. Hmm.

Wait, 45 is a common mass for a (CH3)2CO (acetone, 58) is higher than 45. Wait, maybe it's a CH2COOH (45). Wait, CH2COOH has a molecular weight of 45? Let's calculate: C=12, H=2*(1) =2, COOH is 12+16*2 +1= 45? Wait, CH2COOH is CH2COOH: C2H4O2. So molecular weight: 2*12=24, 4*1=4, 2*16=32. Total 24+4+32=60. So no.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the fragment is a ketene ion (O=C=O), but that's 44. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is from an ester group. For example, the loss of an ester group would leave behind the rest of the molecule. But I'm not sure.

I think I'm stuck. Let me try another approach.

Let me list out the data again:

IR: Broad peak at 3000 (O-H), strong at 1700 (C=O), strong at 1650 (C=O or C=C).

NMR: Vinyl H's present (so C=C).

Mass spec: m/z 45.

Options: A (C6H12O2), C (C6H10O2).

From the IR, two C=O groups, so two O's in the formula are needed (options A and C).

Option C has a degree of unsaturation of 2, so two rings, a ring and double bond, or two double bonds.

If the structure has two double bonds, then in the NMR, you'd expect more vinyl H's, but the question only mentions that some are present, so that could fit.

But the presence of two C=O suggests two carbonyl groups.

So for option C, perhaps the structure is a beta-keto ester, which has two C=O groups. So the IR would show two peaks.

The molecular formula would be C6H10O2. Let me think of an example: maybe something like CH2=C(COOR)COOR', but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester with another carbonyl group.

Wait, another idea: The compound could be a cyclic beta-keto ester. For example, a six-membered ring with a ketone and an ester group. But I'm not sure about the exact structure.

Now, the mass spec fragment m/z 45. If the compound is a beta-keto ester, perhaps the fragment comes from the loss of a part of the molecule, leaving a smaller fragment. For example, losing the ester group and keeping the ketone part. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is a CH2O group. Wait, CH2O is formaldehyde, which is 30, but 45 is higher. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the fragment is a CH3CO group (43) plus a proton, but that's 44. Close to 45. Hmm, not sure.

I think I'm going in circles. Let me try to pick between options A and C.

Option A: C6H12O2. Degrees of unsaturation 1. So one ring or double bond. But we have a double bond (from NMR), so the ring must be the other. But then the IR has two C=O groups. If the structure has a ring and a double bond, but only one C=O group, that doesn't fit the IR data. So option A can't have two C=O groups, which the IR shows. So option A is out.

Therefore, the correct answer must be option C: C6H10O2.

So the chemical formula is C6H10O2.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To identify the unknown compound, the following spectroscopic data was analyzed:

1. **FTIR Spectrum**:  
   - A broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ indicates the presence of an O-H group, likely from an alcohol or carboxylic acid.  
   - Two strong absorption peaks at 1700 cm⁻¹ and 1650 cm⁻¹ suggest the presence of two carbonyl (C=O) groups.  

2. **¹H NMR Spectrum**:  
   - Peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens indicate the presence of a double bond (C=C).  

3. **Mass Spectrometry**:  
   - A fragment peak at m/z = 45 suggests a specific fragment of the molecule.  

### Analysis of Options:
The molecular formula of the unknown compound must account for the observed spectroscopic data. The degrees of unsaturation were calculated for each option using the formula:  
\[
\text{Degrees of Unsaturation} = \frac{(2C + 2 - H - X + N)}{2}
\]  
Assuming no halogens (X) or nitrogen (N), the degrees of unsaturation were determined as follows:  

- **Option A: C₆H₁₂O₂**  
  Degrees of unsaturation = 1.  
  This could correspond to either a ring or a double bond. However, the NMR data indicates a double bond (vinyl hydrogens), and the IR data suggests two carbonyl groups. This option cannot accommodate two carbonyl groups with only one degree of unsaturation.  
  **Eliminated.**

- **Option B: C₆H₁₀O**  
  Degrees of unsaturation = 2.  
  This option has only one oxygen atom, which is insufficient to account for the two carbonyl groups observed in the IR spectrum.  
  **Eliminated.**

- **Option C: C₆H₁₀O₂**  
  Degrees of unsaturation = 2.  
  This option has two oxygen atoms, consistent with the two carbonyl groups observed in the IR spectrum. The two degrees of unsaturation can account for a double bond (from the NMR data) and another double bond or ring. A plausible structure is a β-keto ester, which contains two carbonyl groups and fits the spectroscopic data.  
  **Selected.**

- **Option D: C₆H₁₂O**  
  Degrees of unsaturation = 1.  
  Similar to Option A, this option cannot accommodate two carbonyl groups with only one degree of unsaturation.  
  **Eliminated.**

### Conclusion:
The spectroscopic data, particularly the two carbonyl peaks in the IR spectrum and the presence of vinyl hydrogens in the NMR spectrum, are best explained by a compound with two degrees of unsaturation and two oxygen atoms. The molecular formula **C₆H₁₀O₂** satisfies all the given data.
