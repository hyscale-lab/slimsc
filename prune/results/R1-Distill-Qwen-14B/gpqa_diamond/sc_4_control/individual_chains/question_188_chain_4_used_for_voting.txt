Okay, so I have this question about crystallography, and I'm a bit rusty on the topic, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about finding the interplanar distance for a (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, I remember that interplanar distances are calculated using some formula involving the lattice parameters and the Miller indices.

Wait, so a rhombohedral crystal has all sides equal, right? Or wait, no, rhombohedral is one of the Bravais lattices, and I think it's a special case where all edges are of equal length and the angles between them are all equal but not necessarily 90 degrees. Oh right, like a cube that's been deformed. So in this case, the interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstroms, but I'm not sure if that's the lattice parameter 'a' or something else. Oh, wait, the interatomic distance is the distance between atoms along the edges, so I think 'a' would be this value, 10 Angstroms.

The angles alpha, beta, gamma are all 30 degrees. Wait, but in a rhombohedral system, all angles are equal, so that makes sense. So the unit cell is rhombohedral with a = 10A and angles 30 degrees each.

The interplanar distance formula for a general plane (hkl) in a crystal is given by the formula:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2(hk cos gamma) - 2(hl cos beta) - 2(kl cos alpha) ) )

Wait, but wait. I might be mixing up some terms. Alternatively, I think the formula might be:

d = [ (a^2 (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2 a^2 (hk cos gamma + hl cos beta + kl cos alpha) ) ]^(-1/2)

Wait, no, perhaps the correct formula is:

d = 1 / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2(hk cos gamma) - 2(hl cos beta) - 2(kl cos alpha) ) ) * a

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think. The general formula for interplanar distance in a crystal with lattice parameters a, b, c and angles alpha, beta, gamma is more complex, but in a rhombohedral system, a = b = c, and alpha = beta = gamma = some angle, say theta. So the formula might simplify.

In this case, since all a, b, c are equal (a = b = c = 10A), and all angles are 30 degrees.

The general formula for interplanar distance is:

d = \frac{a}{\sqrt{ h^2 + k^2 + l^2 - 2hk \cos\alpha - 2hl \cos\beta - 2kl \cos\gamma } }

But in rhombohedral, since a = b = c and angles are all the same, so substituting, for (hkl) plane, we get:

d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² - 2hk cosθ - 2hl cosθ - 2kl cosθ )

Because alpha = beta = gamma = theta =30 degrees.

So for the (111) plane, h=1, k=1, l=1.

Substituting, we have:

d = 10 / sqrt( 1 + 1 +1 - 2*(1*1)*cos30 - 2*(1*1)*cos30 - 2*(1*1)*cos30 )

Wait, let me compute the denominator.

Compute the numerator inside the sqrt:

sum = 1 +1 +1 =3.

The terms subtracted are 2*1*1*cos30 for each pair hk, hl, kl. Since all three terms are the same, it's 3 times 2*1*1*cos30.

So sum = 3 - 3*(2 * cos30° )

Wait, wait, no, each term is 2 * hk * cos alpha, but since hk is 1*1, and each of alpha, beta, gamma is 30, so three terms each of 2 * 1 * 1 * cos30.

So the denominator inside the sqrt is: 3 - 3*(2 cos30° )

Wait, but 2*1*1*cos30 for each of the three terms, so total subtracted is 3 * (2 cos30 ). Let me compute that.

Wait, cos30 is approximately sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660.

So 2*cos30 ≈ 1.732.

So each term is 2*cos30 = ~1.732. Since there are three such terms, total subtracted is 3 * 1.732 ≈5.196.

So denominator inside sqrt is 3 -5.196 = -2.196?

Wait, that can't be right. Because the denominator under the square root would be negative, which would make d imaginary, which is impossible. So I must have made a mistake in the formula.

Hmm. Did I get the formula wrong? Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the interplanar distance for a rhombohedral system in a different way.

Wait, another approach. The interplanar distance d can be calculated using the formula:

d = \frac{1}{\sqrt{ (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2 hk \cos\gamma - 2 hl \cos\beta - 2 kl \cos\alpha } } × a

Wait, but in this case, since alpha, beta, gamma are all 30°, but wait, in a rhombohedral system, the angles between the axes are different. Wait, no, I think in a rhombohedral system, the angles between the edges are all equal. But wait, in the standard notation, for a rhombohedral system, the unit vectors a, b, c have equal length and the angles between them are all equal, but perhaps the formula uses the angles between the crystallographic axes, which for a rhombohedral system would be 30°, as given.

Wait, but wait, in the standard formula, the angles used are the angles between the crystallographic axes, which in a rhombohedral system are indeed all equal. So perhaps the formula is correct.

But when I plug in h=1, k=1, l=1, I get 3 - 3* (2 * cos30° )= 3 - 3*(√3) ≈ 3 -5.196 = -2.196.

Which is negative, which can't be. That suggests that either I'm using the wrong formula, or perhaps I have the angles mixed up.

Wait, perhaps in the formula, the angles are the angles between the vectors. So in a rhombohedral system, the angles between the a and b vectors is alpha, between a and c is beta, and between b and c is gamma. But wait, in a rhombohedral system, all these angles are equal, which is the case here (30 degrees each).

But wait, wait. Let me double-check the formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system. Maybe the formula is different.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

d = \frac{a}{\sqrt{ h^2 + k^2 + l^2 - 2hk \cos\alpha - 2hl \cos\beta - 2kl \cos\gamma } }

Which is the same as I had before.

But with the given numbers, this would give negative under the square root, which isn't possible. So that indicates a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the structure of the rhombohedral system. Maybe the formula is different because all the angles are the same and the lattice constants are the same.

Wait, another approach. For a rhombohedral lattice, the reciprocal lattice can be used to find d-spacings. Alternatively, maybe there's an expression specific to rhombohedral systems.

Wait, perhaps for a rhombohedral system with a = b = c = a0 and angles alpha = beta = gamma = θ, the interplanar distance for (hkl) is given by:

d = a0 / sqrt( h² + k² + l² - 2 h k cosθ - 2 h l cosθ - 2 k l cosθ )

Which is what I thought before.

But substituting the given values.

h=1, k=1, l=1.

So:

d = 10 / sqrt(1 +1 +1 - 2*1*1*cos30 - 2*1*1*cos30 - 2*1*1*cos30 )

Which is:

d = 10 / sqrt(3 - 6*(sqrt(3)/2) )

Because cos30 is sqrt(3)/2.

So sqrt(3) is approx 1.732.

6*(sqrt(3)/2) = 3*sqrt(3) ≈5.196.

So denominator inside sqrt is 3 -5.196 = -2.196.

Wait, that's negative. That can't be right. So that must mean I'm using the wrong formula. Alternatively, perhaps the angles in the formula are the angles between the face normals or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is written differently.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the signs. Let me think again. The formula could be:

d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² - 2hk cos α - 2hl cos β - 2kl cos γ )

Wait, but when α, β, γ are the angles between the crystallographic axes, which in rhombohedral system are all 30 degrees. So the formula is correct, but the calculation gives a negative inside the square root, which is impossible. So perhaps this (111) plane doesn't exist? Or perhaps I'm making a mistake in the formula.

Wait, another thought: perhaps in a rhombohedral system, the angles alpha, beta, and gamma are 60 degrees instead of 30? Because I'm getting a negative value, which isn't possible. But the question states the angles are 30 degrees.

Alternatively, perhaps I should instead use the formula that involves the dot product of the reciprocal vectors.

Wait, the reciprocal lattice vectors are given by:

b1 = (2π/a) [ 1, 0, 0 ] 

But no, that's for a cubic system. For a general system, it's more complex. Alternatively, the interplanar distance is given by 1/|n|, where n is the vector in reciprocal space.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula I'm using is correct, but there's a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the denominator correctly.

Wait, the denominator is:

h² +k² + l² - 2hk cosα - 2hl cosβ - 2kl cosγ.

In this case, h=k=l=1, α=β=γ=30°.

So:

1 +1 +1 =3.

Now, 2hk cosα = 2*1*1 * cos30 ≈ 2 * 0.8660 ≈1.732.

Similarly for the other terms:

2hl cosβ = same as above.

2kl cosγ = same.

So total subtracted: 3 * 1.732 ≈5.196.

So denominator inside sqrt is 3 -5.196 = -2.196.

Which is negative. So that can't be right. So perhaps the formula is different.

Wait, perhaps in rhombohedral systems, the angles in the formula are the angles between the reciprocal vectors, not the direct lattice vectors? Or perhaps I have the formula inverted. Alternatively, maybe I should use the supplementary angles.

Wait, another thought: in a rhombohedral system, the angles between the crystallographic axes can be either theta or 180-theta, depending on the specific type of rhombohedral system. Wait, no, I think that applies to other systems like orthorhombic. No, wait, perhaps I should think again.

Alternatively, perhaps in the formula, the angles used are the angles between reciprocal vectors, which would be 180-30=150 degrees. Because sometimes in crystallography, the angles between the reciprocal axes are supplementary to the direct lattice angles. Because the dot product for reciprocal vectors is based on the direct lattice vectors' angles.

Wait, the reciprocal lattice vectors are given by:

b1 = (2π/a) ( a' ), where a' is the unit vector in the direct lattice.

Wait, the dot product between reciprocal vectors would be based on the angles between the direct vectors. So perhaps, the angle between reciprocal vectors is 180 - theta, where theta is the angle between the direct vectors.

So, in this case, the angles between reciprocal vectors would be 150 degrees, because the direct angles are 30.

So, perhaps the formula I should use is with cos(150) instead of cos(30).

Because cos(150) is -sqrt(3)/2 ≈-0.866.

So let me recalculate the denominator with cos(theta) = cos(150°).

So denominator becomes:

3 - 2*(1*1)(-0.866) * 3 terms.

Wait, substituting cos(alpha) = cos(beta) = cos(gamma) = cos(150°) = -sqrt(3)/2.

So:

Denominator = 3 - 2*(1*1)*(-sqrt(3)/2) *3

Wait, each term is 2*1*1*(-sqrt(3)/2) = -sqrt(3).

So subtracting 3 terms: 3 * (-sqrt(3)) = -3*sqrt(3) ≈-5.196.

So denominator = 3 - (-5.196) =3 +5.196=8.196.

So denominator inside sqrt is 8.196.

So sqrt(8.196)= approx 2.863.

So d = 10 / 2.863 ≈3.495 Angstrom.

Wait, but none of the options are around 3.5. The options are much larger, like 8-10 Angstrom. So that can't be right either. So perhaps this approach is wrong.

Hmm. So maybe I'm getting the formula wrong. Another approach might be to consider the structure of the rhombohedral crystal.

Wait, another formula I've come across is for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system:

d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + 2(hk + hl + kl) (1 - cosθ) )

Wait, perhaps that's the correct expression. Because I think sometimes when the angles are acute or obtuse, the formula changes.

Wait, let me think. The general formula for d is:

d = a / sqrt( [h² + k² + l²] - 2 [hk cosα + hl cosβ + kl cosγ] )

In a rhombohedral system, α=β=γ=θ.

So substituting:

d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² - 2 hk cosθ - 2 hl cosθ - 2 kl cosθ )

Which can be rewritten as:

d = a / sqrt( (h + k + l)^2 - 2 (hk + hl + kl) (cosθ + 1) )

Wait, perhaps not. Alternatively, since all angles are the same, the denominator becomes:

h² +k² +l² - 2 cosθ (hk + hl + kl )

So for (111), h=k=l=1.

Denominator: 3 - 2 cosθ (3) = 3 - 6 cosθ.

So denominator =3(1 - 2 cosθ).

So d= a / sqrt(3 (1 - 2 cosθ) )

Now, θ is 30 degrees, so cos30 is sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.866.

So denominator inside sqrt becomes 3*(1- 2*(0.866)) = 3*(1 -1.732) =3*(-0.732) =-2.196.

Again, negative. Hmm. So this suggests that (111) plane is not possible in this rhombohedral system, which can't be the case. So perhaps I'm making a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula uses the angles between the reciprocal vectors instead of the direct lattice vectors. So the reciprocal angles would be 180 - θ, as I thought earlier.

So cos(180-30) = cos(150) = -sqrt(3)/2 ≈-0.866.

So substituting cosθ = cos(150) =-0.866.

Then denominator: 3(1 - 2*(-0.866)) =3(1 +1.732 )=3*(2.732)=8.196.

So sqrt(8.196)=approx 2.863.

So d=10 /2.863 ≈3.495 Angstrom.

But again, the options are all about 8-10 Angstrom, so this approach can't be right.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating the formula. Let me check another source.

Wait, another approach. Maybe the formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is:

d = a * sqrt( [ (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl)(1 - cosθ) ] )^(-1)

Wait, that's a different formula. Let me think. So the denominator becomes:

h² +k² +l² + 2(hk + hl + kl)(1 - cosθ).

Wait, that might make sense because if the angles are less than 90, cosθ is positive, and 1 - cosθ is positive, so the denominator would be larger.

So for (111), denominator:

3 + 2*(3)(1 - cos30).

cos30 is ~0.866.

So 1 - 0.866 =0.134.

So 2*3*0.134=0.804.

So denominator is 3 +0.804=3.804.

So sqrt(3.804)=approx 1.95.

So d=10 / 1.95 ≈5.129 Angstrom.

Still not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps I've swapped the formula. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe I should use the formula for a general hexagonal close-packed structure, but no, this is rhombohedral.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula that in a rhombohedral system, the interplanar distance is given by d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² + l²) + 2 (hk + hl + kl) (1 - cosθ) )

Wait, let me compute that.

h=k=l=1.

So denominator is 3 + 2*(3)(1-cos30) =3 + 6*(0.134) =3 +0.804=3.804.

So sqrt(3.804)=1.95.

So d=10/1.95≈5.13 Angstrom.

Still doesn't match any options. So perhaps this approach is wrong.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the metric tensor to compute the interplanar distance.

The metric tensor for a rhombohedral system is given by:

a^2 [ 1, cosθ, cosθ;
cosθ, 1, cosθ;
cosθ, cosθ, 1 ]

So the reciprocal metric tensor is given by the inverse of this.

The interplanar distance d for (hkl) is given by:

d^2 = (h a)^2 + (k b)^2 + (l c)^2 - 2 h k ab cosβ - 2 h l ac cosγ - 2 k l bc cosα ) / (h² +k² +l² + ... )

Wait, no, perhaps it's better to compute the reciprocal lattice vectors.

In a rhombohedral system, the reciprocal vectors are given by:

b1 = (1/a) [ 1, 1, 1 ].

Wait, no, that's for a cubic system. Wait, no, perhaps for a rhombohedral system, the reciprocal vectors are more complex.

Alternatively, the formula for the reciprocal lattice vectors in a rhombohedral system is:

b1 = (2π/a) [ 1, 0, 0 ]

b2 = (2π/a) [ cosθ, sinθ, 0 ]

b3 = (2π/a) [ cosθ, (cosθ * cosθ + sinθ * sinθ ), ... ] Wait, perhaps this is getting too complicated.

Alternatively, I can compute the reciprocal lattice vectors using the metric tensor.

The metric tensor g is:

g = a^2 [ 1, cosθ, cosθ;
cosθ, 1, cosθ;
cosθ, cosθ, 1 ]

So the reciprocal metric tensor g^-1 is:

(1/(a² (1 - cos²θ - 2 cosθ)) )) * [ 1 - cosθ, -cosθ, -cosθ;
 -cosθ, 1 - cosθ, -cosθ;
 -cosθ, -cosθ, 1 - cosθ ]

Wait, I'm not sure, but perhaps I can compute the determinant of g first.

The determinant of g for rhombohedral is:

det(g) = a^6 [ (1)(1)(1) + ... ] Hmm, perhaps it's a^6 (1 - cosθ)^2 (1 + 2 cosθ )

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute the determinant of g.

g is a 3x3 matrix where the diagonal is 1, and the off-diagonal elements are cosθ.

So the determinant of a 3x3 matrix with diagonal elements a, b, c and off-diagonal elements d is:

det = a(b c - d²) - d (d c - a d) + d (d b - a d )

Wait, perhaps another approach: the determinant of a 3x3 matrix where diagonal elements are 1 and off-diagonal are x is:

1*(1*1 - x^2) - x*(x*1 - x^2) + x*(x^2 - 1*x )

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting stuck here. Alternatively, using the formula for a 3x3 matrix with diagonal elements a, a, a and off-diagonal elements b, b, b:

det = a^3 ( (a^2 - b^2) )^2 / a^3 ) ?

Wait, perhaps this is getting too involved.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the reciprocal lattice vectors for the (111) plane.

The reciprocal lattice vector for (hkl) is:

n = (h, k, l) * (2π/a) * reciprocal metric tensor.

Wait, perhaps another approach is to compute the interplanar distance using the plane equation.

The interplanar distance d is given by:

d = |a| / sqrt( (h a1 + k a2 + l a3)^2 ), where a1, a2, a3 are the reciprocal basis vectors.

Alternatively, perhaps using the formula:

d^2 = (a^2 (h² + k² + l²) ) / [ (h + k + l)^2 - 2 (h(k + l) + k(l + h) + l(h +k)) (1 - cosθ) ]

Wait, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look for a formula specific to the (111) plane in a rhombohedral system.

Wait, considering that all the h, k, l are 1, perhaps the denominator becomes a certain expression.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the rhombohedral system as a special case of the hexagonal system, but no, that's not correct.

Another idea: in a cubic system, the d-spacing is a / sqrt(h²+k² +l²). But in a rhombohedral system, it's different because of the angles.

Wait, another approach: the interplanar distance can be found using the formula:

d = 1 / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) * (a^2) / (V) ) ), where V is the volume of the unit cell.

Wait, the volume V of a rhombohedral unit cell is a³ * sqrt(1 - 3 cosθ + 3 cos²θ ).

Wait, because for a rhombohedral system, the volume V = a^3 * sqrt(1 - 3 cosθ + 3 cos^2θ )

So for θ=30°, cosθ = sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.866.

So V= a^3 * sqrt(1 -3*(0.866) + 3*(0.866)^2 )

Calculate inside the sqrt:

1 - 2.598 + 3 * 0.75 (since 0.866^2 ≈0.75 )

So 1 -2.598 = -1.598.

3 * 0.75 =2.25.

So -1.598 +2.25 =0.652.

So sqrt(0.652)≈0.807.

So V ≈a³ *0.807.

a=10, so V≈1000 *0.807=807 A³.

Now, the formula for d is:

d = 1 / sqrt( (h² +k² + l² ) / V )

Wait, no, perhaps more accurately, the formula is:

d = 1 / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) / (V/a^3) )

Wait, perhaps it's better to express d in terms of the Miller indices and the volume.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² + l²) * (1/(V/a^3)) )

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Alternatively, using the formula:

d = (a) / sqrt( (h² +k² + l²) * (1 + 2 (cos theta) ) )

Wait, perhaps not. Alternatively, perhaps thinking of the d-spacing as:

d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² + l²) + 2 (hk + hl + kl) (1 - cos theta) )

Wait, I think that formula was used earlier.

So with a=10, theta=30, h=k=l=1.

So denominator: 3 + 2*(3)*(1 - cos30)

cos30=√3/2≈0.866.

So (1 - cos30)=0.134.

So 2*3*0.134=0.804.

So denominator=3 +0.804=3.804.

sqrt(3.804)= ~1.95.

So d=10 /1.95≈5.129 A.

Still not matching any options.

Wait, the options given are all around 9 Angstrom. So perhaps I'm making a mistake in considering the interatomic distance as 'a', but perhaps 'a' is different.

Wait, the question says the interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom. Hmm, in a rhombohedral system, the interatomic distance is the distance between nearest atoms, which in a primitive cell would be along the edges, so a would be the interatomic distance. So a=10.

So why am I getting a d-spacing of about 5A when the options are around 9A.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula structure. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is:

d = a / sqrt( h² +k² + l² - 2hk cos(alpha) - 2hl cos(beta) - 2kl cos(gamma) )

But in this case, for (111), it's:

3 -6 cos(30) = 3 - 6*(0.866)=3-5.196= -2.196.

Which is negative, which is impossible.

So perhaps this (111) plane is not allowed in this structure, but that can't be the case as the question asks for it.

Hmm. Maybe the given angles are for the reciprocal lattice? So perhaps the angles in the formula should be 180-30=150 degrees. So cos(150)= -0.866.

So substituting, denominator becomes 3 - 6*(-0.866) =3 +5.196=8.196.

sqrt(8.196)= ~2.863.

So d=10/2.863≈3.495 A.

Still not matching any options. So perhaps I'm using the wrong approach.

Wait, maybe I should compute the interplanar distance using the radius of the atoms. But the question gives the interatomic distance, which is the edge length. So perhaps I should think in terms of vectors.

The (111) plane has a normal vector (1,1,1). The interplanar distance is the distance between two adjacent planes along the normal direction.

So in a rhombohedral system, the lattice vectors are a, b, c, each of length 10 Angstrom, and the angles between each pair is 30 degrees.

So, the reciprocal lattice vectors can be determined, and the interplanar distance is 1 divided by the magnitude of the reciprocal lattice vector.

Wait, perhaps the reciprocal lattice vector for (111) is (1,1,1) in reciprocal space. So the magnitude is sqrt(1^2 +1^2 +1^2 )=sqrt(3). So d=1/sqrt(3) in reciprocal space, which would be 1/(sqrt(3)) * a.

Wait, but that's only for a cubic system. In a rhombohedral system, it's more complex.

Alternatively, perhaps the reciprocal lattice vector is given by:

b = (1/a) * (1,1,1) in the transformed coordinates.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the real space vectors are:

a = (a, 0, 0)

b = (b cos gamma, b sin gamma, 0 )

c = (c cos alpha, c cos beta sin alpha, c sqrt(1 - cos^2 alpha - cos^2 beta sin^2 alpha) )

Wait, perhaps that's getting too involved.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the unit vectors and then find the plane.

The vectors a, b, c have magnitude 10, angles between each other of 30 degrees.

The reciprocal vectors are given by:

b1 = (2π/a) ( a1 . a1^{-1} )

Wait, perhaps another approach: compute the reciprocal lattice vectors using the metric tensor.

The metric tensor g is:

g = [ [ a², a b cos gamma, a c cos beta ],
       [ a b cos gamma, b², b c cos alpha ],
       [ a c cos beta, b c cos alpha, c² ] ]

In a rhombohedral system, a = b = c =10, and all angles are 30°, so cos gamma = cos beta = cos alpha = cos30 ≈0.866.

So g becomes:

g = [ [ 100, 100 * 0.866, 100 * 0.866 ],
       [ 100 * 0.866, 100, 100 * 0.866 ],
       [ 100 * 0.866, 100 * 0.866, 100 ] ]

So each diagonal is 100, and the off-diagonals are 86.6.

The reciprocal metric tensor g^-1 is:

(1/det g) * adjugate(g)

But calculating the determinant of g:

det(g) = a^6 [ 1 - 3 cos^2 theta + 2 cos^3 theta ]

Wait, perhaps that's a formula I can use. Since a = b = c =10, theta =30°, so det(g) =10^6 [1 -3*(0.866)^2 + 2*(0.866)^3 ]

Compute each term:

0.866^2 ≈ 0.75.

0.866^3 ≈ 0.866 *0.75 ≈0.6495.

So:

1 -3*(0.75) +2*(0.6495) =1 -2.25 +1.299= (1-2.25)= -1.25 +1.299=0.049.

So det(g) =10^6 *0.049=49000.

Then, the reciprocal metric tensor g^-1 is (1/49000) times the adjugate of g.

The adjugate is the transpose of the cofactor matrix.

But perhaps I can find the elements of g^-1.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to find the reciprocal lattice vectors using the formula:

b1 = (2π/a) [ 1, 1, 1 ] (in some transformed coordinates), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reciprocal lattice vectors can be found using the formula:

b1 = (2π/a) ( a1 ), where a1 is the unit vector along a.

But perhaps this is leading me nowhere.

Wait, another approach: The interplanar distance d is given by:

d = | (a . (h,k,l)) | / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) )

Wait, no, perhaps that's only for cubic systems.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula involving the dot product of the reciprocal vectors.

The reciprocal lattice vectors are defined as:

b1 = (2π/a) ( a1 )

b2 = (2π/a) ( a2 cos alpha, a2 sin alpha, 0 )

b3 = (2π/a) ( a3 cos beta, a3 (cos gamma sin beta), a3 sqrt(1 - cos^2 beta - cos^2 gamma sin^2 beta) )

Wait, perhaps this is correct. But given that a = b = c =10, and all angles are 30°, this might simplify.

But this is getting too involved, and perhaps I'm not making progress.

Wait, perhaps I can look for an alternative formula.

I found a formula that for a rhombohedral crystal, the interplanar distance d is given by:

d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2 hk (1 - cos alpha) + 2 hl (1 - cos beta) + 2 kl (1 - cos gamma) )

But I'm not sure about this.

Wait, substituting the values:

h=1, k=1, l=1.

So denominator becomes:

3 + 2*1*1*(1 - cos30) *3.

Because alpha=beta=gamma=30.

So (1 - cos30)=1 -0.866=0.134.

So 2*1*1*0.134 =0.268. Multiply by 3 terms: 0.804.

So denominator=3 +0.804=3.804.

sqrt(3.804)=1.95.

d=10/1.95≈5.13 Angstrom.

Still doesn't match any options.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I should calculate the volume of the unit cell and use that in the formula.

Volume V = a^3 * sqrt(1 - 3 cos theta + 3 cos^2 theta )

For theta=30, cos theta=√3/2≈0.866.

So:

1 -3*(0.866) +3*(0.866)^2 ≈1 -2.598 +3*(0.75)=1-2.598+2.25=0.652.

So V=10^3 * sqrt(0.652)=1000 *0.807=807 A^3.

Now, the formula for the interplanar distance is:

d = sqrt( (a^2 (h² +k² +l²) ) / ( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) * (1/(V/a^3)) )) )

Wait, perhaps that's not helpful.

Alternatively, the interplanar distance can be found using the formula:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2 (hk + hl + kl) (1 - cos theta) )

Which brings me back to the same calculation.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Maybe the correct answer is option C) 9.54 Angstrom.

Wait, let me think of another approach. Perhaps the formula uses the volume V in the denominator.

d = sqrt( a^2 (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) ) / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) * (V/a^3) ) )

Wait, no, that's not making sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

d = (a^2) / (sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) * (V) ) )

Wait, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the structure factors and the reciprocal vectors.

Wait, after much confusion, perhaps the correct approach is to use the formula I initially thought of, but considering that the denominator becomes negative, which suggests that the (111) plane is not possible. But the question provides options, so the (111) plane must be possible.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the formula uses the angles between the vectors as 60 degrees instead of 30, which would make the denominator positive.

Wait, if theta=60 degrees, cos60=0.5.

So denominator=3 -6*0.5=3-3=0. Which means d is infinite, meaning that the (111) plane wouldn't exist. Hmm, not helpful.

Wait, perhaps I should compute using theta=60 degrees and see.

No, the question says theta=30 degrees.

At this point, I think I'm stuck and need to make an educated guess.

Looking at the options, the only option that's around 9.5 is option C) 9.54 A.

But how?

Wait, perhaps the formula I used earlier is correct, but I made a miscalculation somewhere.

Wait, let me recompute:

Denominator = 3 - 3*(2 * cos30) 

Wait, 2 * cos30 = 1.732, so 3 *1.732=5.196.

3 -5.196= -2.196.

Negative, so perhaps I should take the absolute value.

Wait, but that's not correct. Alternatively, perhaps the formula uses the absolute value.

If I take sqrt(|-2.196|)=sqrt(2.196)=1.481.

Then d=10 /1.481≈6.75 A.

Still not matching any options.

Alternatively, maybe the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² + l²) + 2 (hk + hl + kl) (1 - cos theta) )

Which for (111) would be:

3 + 3*(2)(0.134) =3 +0.804=3.804.

sqrt(3.804)=1.95.

d=10/1.95≈5.13 A.

No match.

But the options are all much larger. So perhaps I'm missing a factor somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the formula includes the factor of 2π somewhere, but I don't think so.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the distance in reciprocal space and then invert it, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the formula is d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) - 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos theta )

Which for (111) would be:

3 - 3 * (1) * cos30.

So 3 -3*(0.866)=3-2.598=0.402.

sqrt(0.402)=0.634.

d=10/0.634≈15.77 A.

Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps the formula is d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² + l²) + 2 (hk + hl + kl)(1 - cos theta) )

Then:

3 + 3*(2)(0.134)=3 +0.804=3.804.

sqrt(3.804)=1.95.

d=10/1.95≈5.13.

No.

Hmm. I think I might need to conclude that perhaps the correct answer is option C)9.54 Angstrom, but I can't see how without further insight. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula somewhere.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the interplanar distance formula for a rhombohedral crystal is:

d = a (h² +k² + l² + 2(hk + hl + kl) (1 - cos theta) )^(-1/2)

Wait, that would give:

d=10 / sqrt(3 + 3 * 2*(0.134) )

Wait, no, wait. Let me compute:

h² +k² + l² =3.

2*(hk + hl + kl) = 6.

(1 - cos30)=0.134.

So 6 * 0.134=0.804.

So denominator inside sqrt is 3 +0.804=3.804.

So sqrt(3.804)=1.95.

d=10/1.95≈5.13 A.

Still the same result.

I'm stuck. Given the time I've spent, I think I'll have to go with option C)9.54 Angstrom, even though I can't see how to reach it.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the interplanar distance \( d \) for the (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal with interatomic distance \( a = 10 \, \text{Å} \) and angles \( \alpha = \beta = \gamma = 30^\circ \), the formula for the interplanar distance is used:

\[
d_{hkl} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{h^2 + k^2 + l^2 - 2(hk \cos\alpha - hl \cos\beta - kl \cos\gamma)}}
\]

### Substituting the given values:
- \( h = k = l = 1 \)
- \( \alpha = \beta = \gamma = 30^\circ \), so \( \cos 30^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \approx 0.866 \)

The denominator becomes:

\[
h^2 + k^2 + l^2 - 2(hk \cos\alpha + hl \cos\beta + kl \cos\gamma)
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
3 - 2 \cdot 3 \cdot (2 \cdot 1 \cdot 1 \cdot \cos 30^\circ)
\]

\[
3 - 6 \cdot \cos 30^\circ = 3 - 6 \cdot 0.866 \approx 3 - 5.196 = -2.196
\]

This results in a negative value under the square root, which is unphysical. This suggests that the formula may need adjustment or that the angles used are not appropriate for the rhombohedral system.

### Alternate approach:
Considering the possibility that the angles used in the formula are the supplementary angles of the direct lattice angles (i.e., \( 180^\circ - 30^\circ = 150^\circ \)), where \( \cos 150^\circ = -\cos 30^\circ \approx -0.866 \), the denominator becomes:

\[
3 - 2 \cdot 3 \cdot (2 \cdot 1 \cdot 1 \cdot \cos 150^\circ)
\]

\[
3 - 6 \cdot (-0.866) = 3 + 5.196 = 8.196
\]

The square root of \( 8.196 \) is approximately \( 2.863 \), so:

\[
d = \frac{10}{2.863} \approx 3.495 \, \text{Å}
\]

This result is still inconsistent with the provided options, which are much larger (around \( 9 \, \text{Å} \)).

### Final considerations:
After extensive calculations and adjustments to the formula, none of the derived values match the given options. Based on the options provided and the lack of a clear match, the most plausible answer is **C) 9.54 Å**, though the reasoning to reach this value remains unclear.
