Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm. Let me try to think through this step by step.

Alright, the problem says there are two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at speeds of 0.6c and 0.5c, both in the positive x-direction. I need to find the relative speed between them and the total energy. The options are A to D.

First, relative speed in relativity isn't as straightforward as classical mechanics. I remember there's a formula for adding velocities in special relativity. Oh right, the formula is v_rel = (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/c²). Wait, wait, but wait, because they're moving in the same direction, so v1 is 0.6c and v2 is 0.5c. So the relative speed would be (0.6c - 0.5c) divided by (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c²). Let me compute that.

Wait, let me plug in the numbers. v1 is 0.6c, v2 is 0.5c. So their difference is 0.1c. The denominator is 1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²). Let me calculate that: (0.6 * 0.5) * c² / c² = 0.3. So denominator is 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So v_rel is 0.1c / 0.7. 0.1 divided by 0.7 is approximately 0.1428c, which is about 0.14c. So the relative speed is 0.14c. Looking at the options, options C and D have v_rel as 0.14c. So the first part is probably between C and D.

Now for the total energy. Energy in relativity includes both kinetic and rest mass energy. But wait, the problem says "total energy", which would be the sum of the energies of each astronaut. Each astronaut's energy is given by gamma * m c², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So for the first astronaut with mass 2m moving at 0.6c:
Gamma1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1 / sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.

So energy E1 = 1.25 * 2m * c² = 2.5 mc².

Second astronaut: mass 3m, speed 0.5c.
Gamma2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1 / sqrt(0.75). Let me calculate that. sqrt(0.75) is about 0.8660, so 1/0.8660 ≈ 1.1547.

So E2 = 1.1547 * 3m * c² ≈ 3.464 mc².

Adding them together, E_total = 2.5 + 3.464 = approx 5.964 mc². So about 5.96 mc². Looking at options, option C says E=5.96 mc², and D says E=5 mc². So the correct energy would match option C or B. Wait, option B has E=4.96, which is much lower.

So the total energy is approximately 5.96 mc². So the correct answer would have v_rel=0.14c and E=5.96 mc², which is option C.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations. Gamma1: 0.6c, so 0.6^2=0.36. 1-0.36=0.64. sqrt(0.64)=0.8, so gamma is 1.25. Correct. So E1=1.25 * 2m c² =2.5 mc².

Gamma2: 0.5c. (0.5)^2=0.25. 1-0.25=0.75. sqrt(0.75)= approx 0.8660. So gamma is about 1.1547. Multiply by 3m gives 3 * 1.1547=3.464. So E2=3.464 mc².

Adding them: 2.5 + 3.464=5.964, which is about 5.96. So the energy is 5.96 mc². So yes, option C.

Wait, what about the options again? Option C says 0.14c and 5.96 mc². Option D says 0.14c and 5 mc². So option C is the correct one.

To solve the problem, we calculate the relative speed and total energy of the system based on the given data.

### Relative Speed
The relative speed between two objects moving in the same direction at relativistic speeds is given by the formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \(v_1 = 0.6c\) and \(v_2 = 0.5c\). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}}
\]

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} \approx 0.1428c \approx 0.14c
\]

Thus, the relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\).

### Total Energy
The total energy of the system is the sum of the relativistic energies of the two astronauts. The relativistic energy of an object is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

#### For the first astronaut:
- Mass: \(2m\), Speed: \(0.6c\)
- \(\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = \frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25\)
- Energy: \(E_1 = \gamma_1 (2m) c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5mc^2\)

#### For the second astronaut:
- Mass: \(3m\), Speed: \(0.5c\)
- \(\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547\)
- Energy: \(E_2 = \gamma_2 (3m) c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464mc^2\)

#### Total Energy:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5mc^2 + 3.464mc^2 \approx 5.964mc^2 \approx 5.96mc^2
\]

### Final Answer
The relative speed is \(0.14c\), and the total energy of the system is approximately \(5.96mc^2\). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:
