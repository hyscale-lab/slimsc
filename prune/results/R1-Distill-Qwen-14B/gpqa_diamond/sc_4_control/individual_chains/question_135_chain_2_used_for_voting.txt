Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. The question is about the decay modes of a boson X, and it gives me a Lagrangian interaction term. Hmm, right, I remember that the Lagrangian tells us about the interactions between particles.

The mass of the boson X is given as 6 GeV. So I need to find out which particles it can decay into, kinematically allowed at the lowest order. Kinematically allowed means that the decay products' masses must be less than half the mass of X because each product must have at least some energy. Oh wait, right, for a decay into two particles, each should have energy, so the maximum mass each can have is half of the parent's mass.

Looking at the Lagrangian: L(y) = -λf f̄ ψf(y) (upsilon + X(y)) ψf(y). Wait, I think this is a typo or something. Let me parse it again. Oh, maybe it's supposed to be a Yukawa interaction term. The general form is something like L = g ψ ψ X, where X is the boson and ψ are fermions. So the interaction would involve two fermions and the boson X.

Wait, the term is written as -λ f f̄ ψf(y) (upsilon + X) ψf(y). Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Or maybe it's supposed to be L = -λ f [something with ψ and X], I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a typo, and the intended term is something like λ f ψ ψ X, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe the term is written as L = -λ f f̄ ψ(y) X(y) ψ(y), which would make it a Yukawa coupling.

Wait, perhaps the f's are the fermion fields. So the interaction is between two fermions and the boson X. So the vertex would be f f X. So when X decays, it would decay into a pair of fermions.

So the possible decay products of X would be fermion-antifermion pairs. So I need to find all possible fermions that X can couple to, given the interaction term.

Looking at the problem statement again, the interaction term is probably something like L = λ f ψ^† ψ X. So the boson X can decay into any fermion species that it couples to.

But wait, the fermions are the ones that the interaction term allows. So the term here seems to involve f and ψ. Maybe f is a flavor index, so perhaps the interaction is for each fermion species. Hmm, perhaps the interaction is f ψ ψ X, implying that X can decay into any pair of fermions for which the coupling exists.

But the interaction term must be written in a way that's allowed by the Standard Model. For Yukawa couplings, each fermion species can have its own coupling with the scalar (in this case, X is a boson, perhaps a scalar). So the interaction term must involve the Yukawa coupling for each fermion.

Wait, another approach: the possible decay products of X would be any fermion pair (ff̄) where the mass of the fermion is less than or equal to half the mass of X.

Because for a decay X → f f̄, each fermion must have energy at least equal to their rest mass. So the maximum possible mass for each f is m_X / 2. Since X is 6 GeV, each f can be up to 3 GeV.

So which fermions have masses less than or equal to 3 GeV?

Let me list the known fermions and their masses:

- Electron (e): ~0.0005 GeV
- Muon (μ): ~0.105 GeV
- Tau (τ): ~1.777 GeV
- Up quark (u): ~0.0035 GeV
- Down quark (d): ~0.0047 GeV
- Strange quark (s): ~0.095 GeV
- Charm quark (c): ~1.27 GeV
- Bottom quark (b): ~4.13 GeV
- Top quark (t): ~173 GeV

Wait, wait. Quark masses are tricky because they're current quark masses, which are not well-defined for bound particles. However, in terms of constituent masses, but for decay purposes, I think we consider the actual rest mass of the fermion. Because the decay products must be real particles, so for quarks, we can't have free quarks. So perhaps only possible for X to decay into quark-antiquark pairs if they are light enough, but in reality, quarks can't exist freely, so perhaps the decay must produce mesons or something, but the problem is phrased as X → f f̄, so maybe in this context, we're assuming that f can be any fermion, regardless of whether they can be observed as free particles.

Wait, but the problem is about the allowed decay modes, regardless of whether they're observed. So perhaps the question is just about which fermions' rest masses are less than or equal to 3 GeV.

So, let's list the possible fermions:

For leptons:
- e, μ, τ.

Check their masses:
e: ~0.5 MeV → <<3 GeV → allowed.
μ: ~0.1 GeV → allowed.
τ: ~1.777 GeV → allowed.

For quarks:
u, d, s, c (since b is 4.13 GeV which is more than 3 GeV, so not allowed; top is way too heavy).

Wait, wait: u is up, d down, s strange, c charm. Their masses:

u: around 2.2 MeV → allowed.
d: around 4.7 MeV → allowed.
s: around 95 MeV → allowed.
c: around 1.27 GeV → allowed.

So all these quarks are under 3 GeV. b is above, so not allowed.

So X can decay into any of these fermion pairs: e+ e-, μ+ μ-, τ+ τ-, u ū, d d̄, s s̄, c c̄.

Wait, but wait, in terms of the interaction term, the problem's given Lagrangian is L = -λ f f̄ ψf(y) (upsilon + X(y)) ψf(y). Hmm, perhaps this is a Yukawa coupling term where ψf is the fermion field, and f is some index. Alternatively, perhaps the interaction term is written as λ f ψ ψ X, meaning that for each fermion species f, the X couples to f and f̄.

Wait, perhaps the interaction is something like L = λ F ψ_f ψ_f X, which would mean that X can decay into two fermions of type f and f̄. So for each fermion species f that has a non-zero coupling λ_f, X can decay into f and f̄.

So the possible decay products would be all f f̄ pairs where the mass of f is less than or equal to 3 GeV.

So the fermions allowed are e, μ, τ, u, d, s, c.

So X can decay into e+ e-, μ+ μ-, τ+ τ-, u ū, d d̄, s s̄, c c̄.

Looking at the options:

Option A: X → b b̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, τ+ τ−, e+ e−.

Wait, but b is 4.13 GeV, which is more than 3 GeV. So X can't decay into b b̄ because each b would require at least 4.13 GeV, but X is 6 GeV, so each would have to be at least 4.13 GeV, but 2 * 4.13 is 8.26, which is more than 6 GeV. So option A includes b, which is not allowed. So A is incorrect.

Option B: X → c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, τ+ τ−, μ+ μ−, e+ e−. So all the allowed fermions except for c? Wait, c is allowed because 1.27 < 3 GeV. So why is option B including c, but wait, option B has c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. That's all the allowed fermions except for b, which is excluded. So B includes all allowed fermions except the ones above 3 GeV. Wait, option B includes c, which is under 3 GeV. So B is a possible option.

Wait, but option D includes b which is not allowed, so D is incorrect. Let me check. So option D is: X → b b̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, τ+ τ−, μ+ μ−, e+ e−. So that includes b, which is 4.13 GeV, which is over 3 GeV. So X can't decay into b b̄. So D is incorrect.

Option C: X → c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, t t̄, τ+ τ−, μ+ μ−, e+ e−. Wait, t is top quark, which is 173 GeV, way too heavy. So option C includes t, which is impossible. So C is incorrect.

So the only correct option is B, which includes c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. But wait, let me check the options again.

Wait, the options are:

A) X→b b̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, τ+ τ−, e+ e− → includes b → invalid.

B) X→c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, τ+ τ−, μ+ μ−, e+ e− → includes c, which is allowed, and others. So the fermions are e, mu, tau, u, d, s, c. All of these have mass <3 GeV, so their decay is allowed.

So option B is correct.

Wait, but what about the interaction term? The interaction term given in the problem is λ f f̄ ψf(y) (upsilon + X). Hmm, perhaps this term implies that the coupling is only for certain fermions. Alternatively, perhaps the term is written as λ f ψψ X, but I'm not entirely sure. But perhaps the interaction is for each fermion species, so as long as the fermion mass is less than 3 GeV, it's allowed.

Wait, but in reality, the Yukawa coupling may be zero for some fermions, but the question is about kinematics, not about whether the interaction actually occurs. So regardless of the coupling strength, if the mass allows, then it's kinematically allowed.

So the correct answer should be B.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decay modes of a boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV, based on the interaction given by the Lagrangian:

\[
\mathcal{L}(y) = -\lambda f \bar{\psi}_f(y) \left(\upsilon + X(y)\right) \psi_f(y).
\]

The interaction suggests that \( X \) couples to fermion-antifermion pairs (\( f \bar{f} \)), and the decay \( X \to f \bar{f} \) is kinematically allowed if the fermion mass \( m_f \) satisfies \( m_f \leq m_X / 2 \). Since \( m_X = 6 \, \text{GeV} \), the maximum allowed fermion mass is \( m_f \leq 3 \, \text{GeV} \).

### Fermion Masses and Allowed Decays:
1. **Leptons**:
   - Electron (\( e \)): \( m_e \approx 0.0005 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
   - Muon (\( \mu \)): \( m_\mu \approx 0.105 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
   - Tau (\( \tau \)): \( m_\tau \approx 1.777 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).

2. **Quarks**:
   - Up (\( u \)): \( m_u \approx 0.0035 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
   - Down (\( d \)): \( m_d \approx 0.0047 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
   - Strange (\( s \)): \( m_s \approx 0.095 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
   - Charm (\( c \)): \( m_c \approx 1.27 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
   - Bottom (\( b \)): \( m_b \approx 4.13 \, \text{GeV} \) (not allowed, as \( m_b > 3 \, \text{GeV} \)).
   - Top (\( t \)): \( m_t \approx 173 \, \text{GeV} \) (not allowed, as \( m_t > 3 \, \text{GeV} \)).

Thus, \( X \) can decay into the following fermion-antifermion pairs: \( e^+ e^-, \mu^+ \mu^-, \tau^+ \tau^-, u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, s \bar{s}, c \bar{c} \).

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed since \( m_b > 3 \, \text{GeV} \). Incorrect.
- **Option B**: Includes \( c \bar{c}, s \bar{s}, u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, \tau^+ \tau^-, \mu^+ \mu^-, e^+ e^- \), all of which are allowed. Correct.
- **Option C**: Includes \( t \bar{t} \), which is not allowed since \( m_t > 3 \, \text{GeV} \). Incorrect.
- **Option D**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed since \( m_b > 3 \, \text{GeV} \). Incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The kinematically allowed decays of \( X \) are \( X \to c \bar{c}, s \bar{s}, u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, \tau^+ \tau^-, \mu^+ \mu^-, e^+ e^- \), as listed in **Option B**.
