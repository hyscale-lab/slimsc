Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem to solve. The question is about determining the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize a specific compound starting from benzene. The target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Hmm, let's break this down.

First, I need to understand the structure of the target molecule. So, benzene ring with substituents. The positions are numbered 1, 2, and 3. At position 1 is an ethoxy group (–OCH₂CH₃), position 2 is a tert-butyl group (–C(CH₃)3), and position 3 is a nitro group (–NO₂).

Wait, wait. Actually, I should double-check the numbering. When numbering substituents on benzene, the numbering starts such that the substituents get the lowest possible numbers. But sometimes the substituents can be in specific positions based on the synthesis steps.

So, the target is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So, the substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3. Let me visualize the benzene ring with three substituents. Numbering starts so that substituents get the lowest numbers. If I have ethoxy at 1, tert-butyl at 2, and nitro at 3, that's a meta arrangement between nitro and ethoxy? Wait, maybe not. Let me think.

Wait, the positions are 1 (ethoxy), 2 (tert-butyl), and 3 (nitro). So, it's a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene. The substituents are adjacent in a sort of order.

Now, the synthesis steps are all about electrophilic substitution reactions since we're starting with benzene. Each substituent will be added in a specific order, considering the directing effects of each group.

Let me think about the substituents and their directing effects:

- Ethoxy group (–OCH₂CH₃): It's an activating group (because it's an ether, O– is electron-rich) but it's ortho/para directing. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the ethoxy group is an activating group because the lone pairs on oxygen can donate electrons through resonance. So, activating, ortho/para directing.

- Tert-butyl group (–C(CH₃)3): This is a bulky, strong activating group because it's an alkyl group. Alkyl groups are activating and are typically ortho/para directors. But being bulky, it might favor para substitution more in practice due to steric hindrance.

- Nitro group (–NO₂): This is a deactivating, meta-directing group. It's a strong deactivating because of the electron-withdrawing effect.

So the plan is to add these substituents in an order that allows each subsequent substitution to occur in the correct position relative to the existing groups.

Hmm, the target has three substituents: ethoxy, tert-butyl, and nitro. Let's think about the possible order of adding them.

But wait, the substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3. So, if I have ethoxy at position 1, tert-butyl at 2, and nitro at 3, perhaps the nitro group is meta to the ethoxy. Or maybe it's the other way around. Wait, maybe I should draw this mentally.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy and tert-butyl are being added first, and then the nitro group is added in a way that it's in the correct position.

Wait, nitro is a meta director. So, when adding the nitro group, the existing substituents will influence where it goes.

But in this case, we have three substituents, which complicates things because each new group is influenced by all the existing ones.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is the last to be added, so that its position can be controlled.

Wait, but nitration is usually a strong meta director. So, perhaps the nitro group is introduced last.

Let me think step by step.

The target molecule has ethoxy, tert-butyl, and nitro groups in adjacent positions. So, perhaps they are added in a specific order.

Let me consider the possible sequences.

Option 1: Add tert-butyl first, then ethoxy, then nitro.

But wait, when adding substituents, the order matters because each step affects where the next substituent can go.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is introduced first, then the tert-butyl in an ortho position, and then the nitro in a meta position relative to one of them.

Wait, but after adding two substituents, the third substitution's position depends on the directing of all existing groups.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is introduced first. But that's a deactivating group, which would slow down subsequent reactions, but if done first, the remaining groups can be introduced where?

Wait, benzene first gets a nitro group. Then, perhaps ethoxy and tert-butyl are added in positions that are ortho or para to nitro, but nitro is meta directing. Hmm, but that might complicate things.

Alternatively, maybe the ethoxy is introduced first, then the tert-butyl, then the nitro.

Let me think about each step.

First step: Introduce ethoxy group. So, benzene undergoes an alkylation? No, wait. Ethoxy is an ether. To introduce an ethoxy group, we can use an etherification, perhaps via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but that's tricky. Alternatively, perhaps use an ethyl group as an electrophile. Wait, but benzene is undergoing electrophilic substitution, so perhaps using ethyl chloride with a Lewis acid catalyst, like AlCl3, but wait, that would introduce a –CH₂CH3 group, not an ethoxy.

Wait, to get an ethoxy group on benzene, perhaps we need a Friedel Crafts alkylation, but that's for alky groups. Alternatively, perhaps an ether can be introduced via a different method, like using an ethyl group with O as the attacking nucleophile.

Wait, perhaps using a Williamson ether synthesis approach, but that's more for forming ethers between alcohols and alkyl halides. Alternatively, in electrophilic substitution, introducing an ethoxy group might be done via an O-alkylation. That is, using ethyl chloride with a strong base to deprotonate the oxygen, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps using a nitration followed by some steps.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group can be introduced via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution. Wait, but benzene is not very nucleophilic. Maybe after nitration, but that would complicate the order.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a SN2 reaction, but benzene isn't set up for that. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the synthesis steps. The answer options involve some steps, so maybe I should look at what reactions each option involves.

Looking at the options, each option is a sequence of reactions labeled i to ix. So, each option is a different order of steps.

Looking at option D, for example: starts with nitration, then Fe/HCl (maybe a reduction?), then tert-butyl chloride with AlCl3 (Friedel-Crafts?), then another nitration, etc. Hmm.

Wait, to make an ethoxy group on benzene, perhaps we need a Friedel-Crafts acylation followed by something else? Or maybe introducing an ether via a nucleophilic substitution, but that's a bit tricky.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via an alkylation using an ethyl halide and a strong Lewis acid catalyst. Friedel-Crafts alkylation typically adds an alkyl group, but for ethers, perhaps an O-alkylation is possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution where the hydrogen is abstracted, and the ethoxy acts as a nucleophile. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: think about the directing effect in each step.

Suppose the first substituent is the tert-butyl group. Since it's an activating, ortho/para director, the next substitution (like ethoxy) would go into ortho or para to it. Then, adding nitro group as a meta director.

Wait, but the target has all three substituents in adjacent positions (1, 2, 3). So, perhaps the order is tert-butyl, then ethoxy, then nitro.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to add nitro last because it's a meta director, which could help in positioning.

Alternatively, let me think about the substituents:

The target has ethoxy, tert-butyl, and nitro in 1, 2, 3 positions. So, perhaps the ethoxy is in position 1, tert-butyl in 2, and nitro in 3.

Wait, but let's see the directing effects. When adding the nitro group last, the existing substituents (ethoxy and tert-butyl) would influence where the nitro group goes.

But nitro is a meta director. So, the nitro group would prefer to go into a position that's meta with respect to one of the existing groups.

Wait, but in a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene, the nitro is at 3, which is adjacent to both 2 and 1. Hmm, perhaps the nitro group is introduced in a position that's meta to one substituent and ortho to another.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is introduced in a position that's para to the ethoxy and ortho to the tert-butyl, but that might not fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is introduced first. But then, since nitro is a meta director, the next substituent (tert-butyl or ethoxy) would go into a meta position relative to nitro.

Wait, maybe I should approach this by considering the possible reaction sequences in the options.

Looking at option D:

i) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration of benzene to nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → maybe a reduction, like converting nitro to amine? But that's not relevant here because the target has nitro.

Wait, maybe it's something else. Fe/HCl is used in some substitution reactions, perhaps as a catalyst. Or maybe it's a different kind of reaction. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Birch reduction, but that usually involves more steps.

Wait, perhaps option D's steps:

i) Nitration → nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → maybe nothing, if the next step is adding tert-butyl.

iii) tert-butyl chloride with AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts alkylation.

But wait, Friedel-Crafts alkylation requires an activating group. Nitro is a deactivating group, so after nitro is present, Friedel-Crafts won't work because the ring is deactivated. So, in option D, step iii would be after nitration, but that would make the ring deactivating, so Friedel-Crafts wouldn't proceed. So, nitration first would prevent the next alkylation. That's a problem. So option D's sequence is probably wrong because adding tert-butyl after nitration (a deactivating group) wouldn't work.

So, option D is unlikely. Let me check other options.

Looking at option B:

i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts alkylation. So, benzene becomes tert-butylbenzene.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration. Where? The tert-butyl group is ortho/para directing. So, the nitro group would go into either ortho, meta, or para to the tert-butyl. Wait, but nitration is a meta director for itself, but when adding to a ring with an activating group, it would be directed by the activating group. Wait, nitration is an electrophilic substitution, so the substituent on the ring directs where the incoming nitro group goes.

Wait, when we have tert-butyl group, which is activating and ortho/para directing, the nitration would add nitro groups to the ortho or para positions relative to the tert-butyl. So, after adding tert-butyl, nitrating would add nitro either ortho or para. But the target has nitro in a position adjacent to ethoxy and tert-butyl, which is position 3 if ethoxy is at 1 and tert-butyl at 2. Hmm, perhaps not. Let me visualize.

Wait, after adding tert-butyl (say, at position 1), then nitrating would add nitro at position 3 (meta to tert-butyl?), but wait, tert-butyl is ortho/para director, so nitro would be added at ortho or para to it. So, position 2 or 4. But the target has nitro at position 3. So, perhaps this isn't the right sequence.

Alternatively, perhaps the substitution order is different. Let me think more.

Another approach: let's consider the substituents in the order of their introduction.

Assume the first substituent is ethoxy group. Then, the next is tert-butyl, then nitro.

But how to introduce the ethoxy group first. Let's see, to introduce an ethoxy group, perhaps using an electrophilic substitution where the ethoxy is introduced as an electrophile.

Wait, that's not straightforward. Maybe using a Friedel-Crafts acylation, but that would introduce an acyl group, which would then need to be reduced to an ethyl group. That might complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution. For that, the ring needs to be activated towards nucleophilic attack, which typically requires strong activating groups, like amino groups. But that's a longer pathway.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced after the ring is already activated by another substituent.

Wait, maybe the ethoxy group is introduced via an etherification step, using an ethyl halide and a Lewis acid. I'm not sure if that's possible, but maybe.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is added last. Let's think: perhaps the nitro group is added first, then tert-butyl, then ethoxy. But nitro is a deactivating group, so after adding nitro, the tert-butyl (activating) might not be easily added. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the order is tert-butyl first, then ethoxy, then nitro.

Let me think about that. Adding tert-butyl first (step i: Friedel-Crafts alkylation with tert-butyl chloride and AlCl3). Now, the ring has a tert-butyl group, which is ortho/para directing. Then, add the ethoxy group. Since tert-butyl is activating, the ethoxy group would be added in ortho or para position relative to tert-butyl.

Wait, but ethoxy is a stronger activating group than tert-butyl. So, when adding the ethoxy group, the directing effect would be governed by the most activating group. Wait, but once you have two substituents, the next substituent's position depends on the combined directing effects.

But, for the steps, the second substituent (ethoxy) would be added under the influence of the first substituent (tert-butyl). So, ethoxy would go ortho or para to tert-butyl.

Then, adding the nitro group as the third substituent. Since nitro is a meta director, but when added to a ring with existing substituents, the position depends on all existing groups.

Wait, but in the target molecule, the nitro is at position 3, which is adjacent to both ethoxy (position 1) and tert-butyl (position 2). So, if tert-butyl is at position 2, and ethoxy at position 1, then the nitro would be at position 3, which is adjacent to both.

Hmm, but how do we get the nitro group there?

Wait, after adding tert-butyl and ethoxy, the ring has two substituents: tert-butyl and ethoxy. The third substituent, nitro, needs to go in position 3.

But what's the directing effect when two substituents are present? The most activating group could dominate, or the positions could be directed by the existing substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps the order is to add tert-butyl, then nitro, and then ethoxy. Let's see.

First, tert-butyl added (position 1). Then, nitration would add nitro in a position ortho or para to tert-butyl. Let's say nitro is added at position 3 (ortho to tert-butyl). Then, adding ethoxy, which is an activating group, would be directed by the existing substituents.

Wait, after tert-butyl (position 1) and nitro (position 3), adding ethoxy. The ethoxy group is an activating, ortho/para director. But the ring now has two substituents: tert-butyl (activating, ortho/para) and nitro (deactivating, meta). The ethoxy group would prefer to go into a position that is ortho or para to the tert-butyl, but also considering the nitro group's directing.

Wait, position 2 is ortho to tert-butyl (position 1) and adjacent to nitro (position 3). But nitro is a meta director, so it would direct incoming substituents to meta positions relative to itself.

Wait, but position 2 is adjacent (ortho) to nitro (position 3). Nitro's meta would be position 6, but I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group would be directed by the tert-butyl group to position 2 (ortho to tert-butyl), which is also adjacent to nitro (position 3). That would give the substituents at 1 (tert-butyl), 2 (ethoxy), and 3 (nitro), which matches the target.

So, the order would be:

1. Add tert-butyl (Friedel-Crafts alkylation, step i)

2. Add nitro (nitration, step ii)

3. Add ethoxy (O-alkylation, step iii)

Wait, but adding the nitro after tert-butyl would position nitro in an ortho or para position to tert-butyl. Let's say at position 3 (ortho). Then, ethoxy would be added ortho to tert-butyl (position 2) because tert-butyl is a strong activating group, and that's the most favorable position. So, the substitution would occur at position 2, which is ortho to tert-butyl and adjacent to nitro.

Wait, but ethoxy is an activating group. So, when adding a third substituent, where would it go? The ethoxy group would be added in a position ortho or para to the tert-butyl group and meta to the nitro group.

But if the nitro group is at position 3, and tert-butyl at 1, then position 2 is ortho to tert-butyl and adjacent to nitro. Would that be a favorable position for ethoxy? Well, the nitro group is deactivating, so it would direct incoming substituents to its meta position, which is position 6. But ethoxy is more activated by the tert-butyl group, which is activating, so perhaps the ethoxy group goes into position 2 (ortho to tert-butyl), despite the presence of nitro.

So, the order would be tert-butyl first, then nitro, then ethoxy. But looking back at the options, let's see which option follows this order.

Looking at option B:

i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts, adds tert-butyl.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration. So, nitro is added ortho or para to tert-butyl. Let's say at position 3.

iii) Fe/HCl → Not sure. Fe/HCl is used in some reactions. Maybe it's a reduction step? But in this context, nitro is already present, so perhaps not.

iv) HNO3/H2SO4 → another nitration? That doesn't seem right, as we already have nitro.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me check each option's steps.

Option B:

i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → adds tert-butyl.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration, adds nitro at ortho or para.

iii) Fe/HCl → perhaps a substitution or reduction, but not sure.

iv) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration again? Not sure why that would happen.

v) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat → hydrolysis (maybe of a diazonium salt to phenol? But target has nitro, not phenol).

vii) NaOH/EtBr → perhaps an alkylation, like SN2 with ethyl bromide. But that would require a good leaving group, which isn't present.

viii) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonation, maybe introducing a sulfonic acid group, but target doesn't have that.

ix) dilute H2SO4 → perhaps acid workup.

Hmm, this doesn't seem to fit, because after adding tert-butyl and nitro, the steps don't lead to ethoxy.

Option A:

i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → adds tert-butyl.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration.

iii) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonation.

iv) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

v) dilute H2SO4 → hydrolysis.

vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat → more hydrolysis.

vii) NaOH/EtBr → perhaps ethoxy group introduction via alkylation.

viii) Fe/HCl → maybe a reduction.

ix) HNO3/H2SO4 → another nitration.

Not sure, but seems like it's adding multiple groups.

Option C:

i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → adds tert-butyl.

ii) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonation. Hmm, introduces a sulfonic acid group, which is a strong deactivating, meta-directing group.

iii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration. But after sulfonation, the ring is deactivated, so nitration would be difficult.

So option C may not be correct because sulfonic acid is a strong deactivator, making further electrophilic substitution difficult.

Option D:

i) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration, adds nitro.

ii) Fe/HCl → unclear.

iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts after nitro, which is deactivating. Friedel-Crafts alkylation requires an activating group; nitro is deactivating, so this step wouldn't proceed. So option D is invalid.

So, from the options, option B or A might be possible, but let me think again.

Wait, the target has an ethoxy group. How is that introduced? Through an alkylation step, perhaps.

Looking for a step that introduces the ethoxy group. Looking at the options, steps involving NaOH/EtBr (like SN2) could introduce an ethoxy group if there's a leaving group, but I'm not sure where that would come from.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via an O-alkylation. For that, maybe the benzene ring has a good leaving group, like a nitro group, but that's not typically the case.

Wait, another approach: perhaps after introducing the nitro and tert-butyl groups, a diazonium salt is formed, which is then replaced by an ethoxy group.

Wait, but in the options, I see steps like NaNO2/HCl, which is diazotization, followed by treatment with H3O+ and heat, which would typically hydrolyze the diazonium salt to a phenol. But in some cases, with other conditions, it can be replaced by another group.

Wait, in the presence of a good nucleophile, a diazonium salt can undergo substitution. For example, if you have a diazonium salt and treat it with ethanol in the presence of HCl, you can get an O-ethylation. So, perhaps the steps involve converting a nitro group into a diazonium salt, then substituting it with ethoxy.

Wait, but nitro groups are not directly converted into diazonium salts without being reduced to amine first. So, for that, you would need to reduce nitro to amine. Then, the amine can be converted to diazonium salt.

So, the steps would be:

Nitro → amine (using Fe/HCl, which is a reducing agent), then amine → diazonium salt (using NaNO2 and HCl), then diazonium → ethoxy via substitution.

So, perhaps the nitro group is first added, then reduced to amine, then converted to diazonium, then substituted with ethoxy.

But wait, in the target, the nitro group is present, not an ethoxy group. So, that approach wouldn't work because we want to keep the nitro group.

Hmm, perhaps that's not the right way.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution after activating the ring. For that, the ring must have strong activating groups, such as amino groups. But that would require introducing an amino group, which would then be replaced.

Wait, but the target doesn't have an amino group. So perhaps that's not the way.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via Friedel-Crafts alkylation, but that requires a Lewis acid and an alkyl halide. Wait, but Friedel-Crafts alkylation typically adds an alkyl group, not an ether. So, maybe that's not applicable.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a Williamson-type synthesis, but that's more for making ethers from alcohols and alkyl halides, not directly applicable here.

I'm getting a bit stuck on how the ethoxy group is introduced. Let me think again about the options.

Looking at option B, the final steps (vii and viii) are NaOH/EtBr and SO3/H2SO4. Wait, NaOH and EtBr would typically do an SN2 reaction, but on what? Maybe it's an alkoxy group substitution. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced in step vii of option B: NaOH/EtBr. Maybe that's an alkoxy group substitution.

Wait, but for that, there needs to be a leaving group on the ring. But where would that come from?

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the correct order of substituent addition.

The correct order should be adding substituents in such a way that each new substituent goes into the correct position, considering the directing effects of existing groups.

If I have the tert-butyl group first, then add nitro, then add ethoxy. Let me see:

1. Add tert-butyl (step i: Friedel-Crafts alkylation). Now, benzene has tert-butyl at position 1.

2. Nitration (step ii). The tert-butyl is activating and ortho/para directing. Nitro can go to position 2 (ortho) or 4 (para). If it goes to position 2, then the next step is adding ethoxy, which would be directed by both the tert-butyl and nitro groups.

But the target has nitro at position 3, so perhaps nitro is added at position 3. Wait, but tert-butyl is at 1, and the nitro would be at 3, which is meta to tert-butyl. Wait, but tert-butyl is ortho/para directing, so nitro would go to ortho (2) or para (4), not meta (3). So, perhaps this approach isn't correct.

Wait, maybe I'm making a mistake here. When a substituent is ortho/para directing, the incoming group can go to ortho or para, but if the ring is already substituted with another group, the position might be determined by the most influential group.

Wait, perhaps when adding the second substituent, the third substituent's position is determined by the existing substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps the first substituent is nitro, the second is tert-butyl, and the third is ethoxy. But adding nitro first would deactivate the ring, making Friedel-Crafts alkylation difficult.

Wait, perhaps adding ethoxy first. But how? Let me think.

If I add ethoxy first, then the ring has an activating, ortho/para director. Then, add tert-butyl, which is also activating and ortho/para. The tert-butyl would then go into ortho or para to the ethoxy. Then, add nitro, which is a meta director. The nitro would go into a position meta to either the ethoxy or the tert-butyl, depending on which has a stronger influence.

But this is getting complicated. Let me think about the target again. The substituents are at 1,2,3. So, perhaps the nitro is at position 3, ethoxy at 1, tert-butyl at 2.

So, the order could be:

1. Add nitro at position 3. But that would require the ring to be activated at position 3, which is tricky.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro is added after the ethoxy and tert-butyl.

Wait, let me think about the steps in option A:

Option A:
i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → adds tert-butyl.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration.

iii) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonation.

iv) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

v) dilute H2SO4 → hydrolysis.

vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat → hydrolysis.

vii) NaOH/EtBr → perhaps O-alkylation.

viii) Fe/HCl → reduction.

ix) HNO3/H2SO4 → another nitration.

Hmm, this seems complicated. Maybe the sequence is not correct.

Option C:

i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → adds tert-butyl.

ii) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonation (adds -SO3H group, which is deactivating, meta director).

iii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration. But with the ring already deactivated by sulfonic acid, nitration would be difficult.

So, option C may not be correct.

Option B:

i) tert-butyl.

ii) nitration.

iii) Fe/HCl → maybe reduction.

iv) HNO3/H2SO4 → another nitration.

v) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat → hydrolysis to phenol? But target has nitro.

vii) NaOH/EtBr → O-alkylation.

viii) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonation.

ix) dilute H2SO4.

Hmm, perhaps after steps i and ii, we have tert-butyl and nitro on the ring. Then, step iii is Fe/HCl, which might reduce nitro to amine, but that's not helpful here. Alternatively, perhaps step iii is a substitution reaction.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about each option's final product.

Option B's steps:

After i, ii: benzene → tert-butyl benzene → nitro is added, say at position 3 (if tert-butyl is at 1, nitro at 3). Then, step iii: Fe/HCl. FeCl3 is a Lewis acid, but Fe/HCl is more about reduction. Maybe step iii is reducing nitro to amine? But that would change the substituent.

Wait, but the target has nitro, not amine. So, perhaps that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps step iii is something else. Maybe it's a substitution, but I'm not sure.

Option B's step iii: Fe/HCl → perhaps nothing? It's unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via step vii: NaOH and EtBr. NaOH in aqueous solution with EtBr is typically for SN2 reactions. So, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a nucleophilic substitution.

But where is the leaving group? Maybe the benzene ring has a good leaving group, like a nitro group, but nitro groups aren't typically leaving groups. Alternatively, perhaps the ring has a diazonium salt.

Wait, step v is NaNO2/HCl, which would form a diazonium salt. Then, step vi is H3O+ and heat, which would hydrolyze the diazonium salt to a phenol. Then, step vii is NaOH and EtBr, which could perform an O-alkylation, replacing the phenol's –OH with –OEt.

So, if that's the case, let me walk through option B's steps:

i) Add tert-butyl → benzene → tert-butyl benzene.

ii) Nitration → adds nitro in ortho or para to tert-butyl. Let's say position 3 (ortho to tert-butyl at 1).

iii) Fe/HCl → perhaps nothing, or maybe reduces nitro to amine? Unlikely because the target has nitro.

iv) HNO3/H2SO4 → another nitration, but ring already has nitro, making this difficult. So, perhaps this step is not correct.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me re-express the steps in option B:

i) tert-butyl added.

ii) Nitro added.

iii) Fe/HCl → maybe reduction of nitro to amine.

iv) Nitration again → but ring is already deactivated by amine (if reduced), so nitration is unlikely.

Hmm, this doesn't seem right.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is to add tert-butyl first, then nitro, then ethoxy via O-alkylation after making a phenol from a diazonium salt.

Let me think again. To get ethoxy, perhaps:

1. Introduce nitro group first. Then, reduce nitro to amine. Then, convert amine to diazonium salt. Then, perform O-alkylation with ethanol to introduce ethoxy. But then, the nitro group would have been converted to ethoxy, which isn't desired.

Hmm, perhaps that's not the way.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a separate Friedel-Crafts alkylation, but that would require an activating group. So, if I have tert-butyl and nitro groups, which are activating and deactivating, respectively, perhaps the ethoxy can be added in a position directed by tert-butyl.

Wait, in option B, after adding tert-butyl and nitro, perhaps the ethoxy is added via step vii: NaOH and EtBr. But what's the mechanism here?

Alternatively, perhaps after steps i and ii in option B (tert-butyl and nitro), step iii (Fe/HCl) is a reduction of nitro to amine. Then, step iv (another nitration) would not happen. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a substitution reaction where a leaving group is present. But I don't see a leaving group in the target molecule.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is introduced last.

Let me think again about the correct order:

To get the substituents in positions 1 (ethoxy), 2 (tert-butyl), 3 (nitro), perhaps the order is:

1. Introduce tert-butyl (position 2).

2. Introduce nitro (position 3, which is meta to tert-butyl? No, tert-butyl is ortho/para, so nitro would go to ortho or para.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the positions wrong. Let me number the benzene ring with substituents:

If tert-butyl is at position 2, then nitro can be at position 3 (ortho to tert-butyl), and ethoxy at position 1.

Wait, but how would that happen?

Let me outline the steps again:

1. Add tert-butyl group (step i: Friedel-Crafts) → benzene becomes tert-butylbenzene.

2. Nitration (step ii) → nitro adds ortho or para to tert-butyl. Let's say position 3.

3. Add ethoxy group (step iii: perhaps via O-alkylation, but I'm not sure how).

But I'm not seeing the steps in any option that would do this.

Looking back at the options, perhaps option B is the correct one. Let's see:

Option B:

i) Friedel-Crafts → tert-butyl.

ii) Nitration → nitro added, ortho to tert-butyl (position 3).

iii) Fe/HCl → maybe nothing.

iv) Nitration again → but the ring is already deactivated by nitro, so unlikely.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something.

Alternatively, let me think about the synthesis steps in option B:

After i and ii, you have nitro at position 3 and tert-butyl at position 1.

Then, step iii: Fe/HCl → maybe reduces nitro to amine. Then, step iv: nitration again. But the ring is more activated now (because amine is activating), but it's already substituted. So, adding another nitro group isn't part of the target.

Alternatively, perhaps steps iii and iv are not for adding nitro but for something else.

Alternatively, perhaps step iv is another nitration, but I don't see how that helps.

This is getting quite tangled. Maybe I should think about the substituents' positions and the reaction sequences.

The target has three substituents: ethoxy (1), tert-butyl (2), nitro (3).

So, the substituents are adjacent in a way that each is ortho to the next.

To achieve that, the substituents must be added in a specific order that allows each new substituent to be placed in the correct position.

Perhaps the correct order is:

1. Add tert-butyl.

2. Add ethoxy.

3. Add nitro.

But how? Because when adding nitro last, it would be directed by both tert-butyl and ethoxy.

Alternatively, perhaps the order is:

1. Add nitro.

2. Add ethoxy.

3. Add tert-butyl.

But this is unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is:

Add ethoxy first → activating, ortho/para.

Then, add tert-butyl → ortho or para to ethoxy.

Then, add nitro → which would be meta to ethoxy and ortho to tert-butyl. Hmm, but that's getting complicated.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is added last. So, steps would be:

1. Add tert-butyl.

2. Add nitro.

3. Add ethoxy.

But how does the ethoxy get added into position 1, which is adjacent to both tert-butyl (position 2) and nitro (position 3).

Wait, perhaps after adding tert-butyl and nitro, the third substituent (ethoxy) is added in a position that's ortho to tert-butyl and adjacent to nitro. But how?

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B.

But I'm getting stuck, so maybe I should think about the options again.

Looking for the correct sequence:

We need to introduce ethoxy, tert-butyl, and nitro in the right order.

Option D's steps: Nitration first, then Fe/HCl (maybe reduction), but Friedel-Crafts after that would be difficult.

Option B: adds tert-butyl, then nitro, then maybe ethoxy via some steps.

Option A: adds tert-butyl, then nitro, then sulfonation, then diazotization, etc. I don't see the ethoxy introduction.

Option C: adds tert-butyl, sulfonates, then nitrates, which seems unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is to add ethoxy first, then tert-butyl, then nitro.

But how to add ethoxy first.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution after activating the ring with a strong activating group.

But since benzene is not very reactive, perhaps we can't do that. So, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a Friedel-Crafts alkylation, but with an ethyl group, but that would give an ethyl group, not an ethoxy. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via an etherification reaction, using an ethyl group as an electrophile. For that, perhaps using an ethyl sulfate or similar under acidic conditions.

Wait, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B, because in its steps, after adding tert-butyl and nitro, the ethoxy is introduced via NaOH and EtBr. But how?

Alternatively, perhaps the steps involving NaNO2 and HCl (diazotization) and then treatment with ethanol would introduce the ethoxy group.

Wait, let me outline the steps for option B:

i) Add tert-butyl → benzene becomes tert-butylbenzene.

ii) Nitration → nitro added, say at position 3 (ortho to tert-butyl).

iii) Fe/HCl → maybe reduces nitro to amine.

iv) Nitration again → but that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, perhaps iii is a substitution. But without a leaving group, I don't see how.

Alternatively, perhaps after steps i and ii, we have tert-butyl at 1 and nitro at 3.

Then, step iii: Fe/HCl → maybe this is for a ring substitution.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think about the correct order of substituents.

The target is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.

So, substituents are:

Position 1: ethoxy

Position 2: tert-butyl

Position 3: nitro.

So, the substituents are in a 1,2,3 arrangement.

Perhaps the correct order is adding tert-butyl at position 2, then ethoxy at position 1, then nitro at position 3.

But how to achieve that.

Adding tert-butyl first (step i), then adding ethoxy.

But ethoxy is an activating group, so when adding ethoxy to a ring that already has tert-butyl (which is activating and ortho/para), the ethoxy would go into ortho or para to tert-butyl.

Wait, if tert-butyl is at position 2, then the ethoxy could go into position 1 (ortho to tert-butyl at 2) or position 3 (meta to tert-butyl, which is not ortho/para). So, ethoxy would go into position 1.

Then, adding nitro group. Now, the ring has ethoxy (position 1) and tert-butyl (position 2). The nitro group would be directed by both groups.

Ethoxy is ortho/para, tert-butyl is ortho/para. So, the nitro group could go into position 3, which is meta to ethoxy and ortho to tert-butyl.

Hmm, that seems possible.

So, the order would be:

1. Add tert-butyl → position 2.

2. Add ethoxy → position 1.

3. Add nitro → position 3.

Now, how to perform these steps.

Step 1: Friedel-Crafts with tert-butyl chloride → adds tert-butyl.

Step 2: Introduce ethoxy. How? Maybe via a separate Friedel-Crafts alkylation, but with an ethoxy group. Wait, no, Friedel-Crafts adds alkyl groups, not ether groups.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a nucleophilic substitution. But without a good leaving group, that's not feasible.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a substitution after activating the ring.

Wait, perhaps after adding tert-butyl, the next step is to introduce ethoxy via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but that requires a strong activating group, which tert-butyl provides. So, perhaps introducing ethoxy as an electrophile.

Wait, but I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a reaction involving a diazonium salt.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution after converting a halogen into an ether.

Wait, but I'm not seeing that in the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via an O-alkylation after forming a phenoxide ion. But that's speculative.

Hmm, perhaps the correct sequence is option B, but I'm not seeing it clearly.

After much thought, I think the correct answer is option B. Here's why:

Option B's steps:

i) Add tert-butyl.

ii) Nitrate → nitro at position 3.

iii) Fe/HCl → perhaps nothing.

iv) Nitrate again → Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is option D, but I thought that adding nitro first would prevent Friedel-Crafts.

Hmm, I'm still not confident. Another approach: look for the presence of nitro group and ethoxy group in the correct positions.

In the target, the nitro is at position 3, which is meta to ethoxy (position 1) and adjacent to tert-butyl (position 2). So, when adding nitro, it must be influenced by both groups.

But how to get that.

If the order is:

1. Add tert-butyl → position 2.

2. Add ethoxy → position 1.

3. Add nitro → position 3.

So, the steps would involve:

i) Friedel-Crafts to add tert-butyl.

ii) Introduce ethoxy. But how?

Looking at the options, option B's step vii is NaOH and EtBr, which could be for introducing ethoxy.

So, perhaps after adding tert-butyl and nitro, the ethoxy is introduced via O-alkylation.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is added before nitro.

This is getting too confusing. Given the time I've spent, I'll make an educated guess based on the reaction sequences.

The correct sequence starts with adding tert-butyl, then nitro, then ethoxy via O-alkylation after making a diazonium salt from an amine.

But looking at option B, after steps i and ii, the ring has tert-butyl and nitro. Then, step iii is Fe/HCl, which might reduce nitro to amine. Then, step iv is another nitration, which doesn't make sense. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B, because it's the only option where tert-butyl is added first, then nitro, then possibly ethoxy via substitution.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via an SN2 reaction, using NaOH and EtBr, after the ring has a good leaving group, like a nitro group. But nitro groups aren't good leaving groups.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is introduced via a substitution of a tosyl group, which could be added earlier.

But I'm not seeing that in the options.

Given the time I've spent, I'll conclude that the correct answer is option B, because it starts with tert-butyl, then nitro, and then has steps that might introduce ethoxy.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene, the sequence of reactions must carefully consider the directing effects of substituents and the feasibility of each step. The target molecule has three substituents: an ethoxy group at position 1, a tert-butyl group at position 2, and a nitro group at position 3. The synthesis involves electrophilic aromatic substitution, and the order of adding substituents is critical to achieving the correct positions.

### Key Analysis of the Options:

1. **Option A**:
   - Step i: Friedel-Crafts alkylation with tert-butyl chloride adds the tert-butyl group.
   - Step ii: Nitration adds the nitro group, which would be directed to the ortho or para position relative to the tert-butyl group.
   - Step iii: Sulfonation introduces a sulfonic acid group, which is a strong deactivating, meta-directing group. This would complicate subsequent steps.
   - The sequence does not clearly lead to the correct positions for all substituents, and the introduction of the ethoxy group is unclear.

2. **Option B**:
   - Step i: Friedel-Crafts alkylation with tert-butyl chloride adds the tert-butyl group.
   - Step ii: Nitration adds the nitro group, which would be directed to the ortho or para position relative to the tert-butyl group.
   - Step iii: Fe/HCl could reduce the nitro group to an amine, but this would alter the substituent, which is not desired.
   - Step iv: Another nitration step is unlikely to proceed effectively after the ring is deactivated.
   - The sequence does not clearly explain how the ethoxy group is introduced in the correct position.

3. **Option C**:
   - Step i: Friedel-Crafts alkylation with tert-butyl chloride adds the tert-butyl group.
   - Step ii: Sulfonation introduces a sulfonic acid group, which is a strong deactivating, meta-directing group. This would make further electrophilic substitution difficult.
   - Step iii: Nitration would struggle to proceed due to the deactivation of the ring by the sulfonic acid group.
   - This sequence is not viable for achieving the target molecule.

4. **Option D**:
   - Step i: Nitration introduces the nitro group, which is a strong deactivating, meta-directing group. This would make subsequent Friedel-Crafts alkylation steps (e.g., step iii) difficult or impossible.
   - The sequence is unlikely to yield the desired product due to the deactivation of the ring by the nitro group early in the synthesis.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing all options, **Option B** is the most plausible sequence. It begins with the Friedel-Crafts alkylation to add the tert-butyl group, followed by nitration to introduce the nitro group. While the subsequent steps (e.g., Fe/HCl and another nitration) are unclear, this sequence aligns most closely with the required order of substituent addition and the directing effects of the groups. The introduction of the ethoxy group may involve steps not explicitly detailed in the sequence but is more feasible in this context.

**Answer: B**
