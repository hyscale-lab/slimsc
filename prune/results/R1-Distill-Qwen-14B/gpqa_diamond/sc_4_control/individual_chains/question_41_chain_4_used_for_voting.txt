Okay, so I have this physics problem here. Let's see. The question is about a light beam moving through glass, and the glass itself is moving in the same direction as the beam. Hmm. I remember that when objects move relative to each other, especially at high speeds, we have to consider relativistic effects, but wait, glass moving at a constant velocity, so maybe it's in an inertial frame. Hmm, I'm a bit confused.

Wait, the question is about the speed of light in the glass relative to the lab frame. Oh right, in a vacuum, the speed of light is always c, but when it's in a medium like glass, its speed is slower, right? So normally, the speed of light in glass is c/n, where n is the refractive index. But wait, the glass is moving. So does that change anything?

I'm thinking about how different reference frames affect measurements of light speed. Oh, wait, from the lab frame, the glass is moving, but each point in the glass is moving at velocity v. The light beam is moving through the glass, which is itself moving. So how does that affect the speed of the light as observed in the lab?

Wait, but the speed of light in a medium (like glass) is c/n. But when the medium is moving relative to the observer, does that change the observed speed? I'm a bit mixed up. Let's think about the principles here.

In special relativity, the speed of light is the same in all inertial frames. But that's when the light is in a vacuum. Wait, the glass isn't a vacuum. So in this case, the glass is a medium, and the light's speed in that medium is c/n when the medium is at rest. But when the medium is moving, how does that affect the speed as observed?

Wait, this might be a case where you have to apply the velocity addition formula from special relativity. Because the glass is moving, and the light is moving within it. So the speed of the light in the lab frame would be a combination of the speed of the light in the glass's frame and the speed of the glass itself.

Wait, the velocity addition formula is u' = (u + v) / (1 + (u*v)/c²). But wait, no, that's when adding velocities. So in this case, in the rest frame of the glass, the light is moving at speed u = c/n. Then, the lab frame sees the glass moving at speed V. So we need to find the speed of the light in the lab frame, which would be u'.

But wait, is it that straightforward? Because the light's speed in the glass is u = c/n, regardless of the glass's motion. Wait, no, that's not correct because the refractive index itself might depend on the motion of the medium. But in this problem, the refractive index n is given as a constant, so perhaps we can assume it's the same in all frames? Or maybe the problem is considering only non-relativistic speeds, so that the motion of the medium doesn't significantly affect n.

Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Let me think again. The problem states that the glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam, towards the observer. Wait, same direction as the beam and toward the observer. So the beam is moving towards the observer, and the glass is moving towards the observer in the same direction. Wait, no, same direction as the beam. So the beam is, say, moving to the right, and the glass is also moving to the right, toward the observer. Wait, no, the observer is in the lab, and the glass is moving towards the observer. Oh, wait, perhaps the beam is moving toward the observer, and the glass is moving toward the observer as well, in the same direction. So the beam is going towards the observer, and the glass is moving in the same direction, which is towards the observer. So the beam is moving at speed c/n in the glass's frame.

Wait, but when the glass is moving, the lab frame would see the light moving at a different speed. So I think I have to apply the relativistic velocity addition formula here.

So in the glass's frame, the light is moving at u = c/n. The glass itself is moving at velocity v relative to the lab frame. So the lab frame would measure the speed of the light as u', which is (u + v) / (1 + (u*v)/c²) ?

Wait, but wait. Let me clarify: the glass's frame is moving at velocity V (which is v) relative to the lab. In the glass's frame, the light is moving at speed u = c/n. So the lab would see the light moving at u'.

So the formula is u' = (u + V) / (1 + (u V)/c² )

Wait, but wait, the velocity addition formula is: if an object has velocity u in frame S', which is moving at velocity V relative to frame S, then the velocity in S is u' = (u + V) / (1 + (u V)/c² )

But wait, in this case, the glass is moving at V = v relative to the lab. And the light's speed in the glass's frame is u = c/n. So substituting that into the formula:

u' = ( (c/n) + v ) / ( 1 + ( (c/n) * v ) / c² )

Simplify the denominator: 1 + (v/(c n)).

So u' = [ (c + n v ) / n ] / [ (1 + (v)/(n c) ) ]

Wait, let's compute numerator and denominator.

Numerator: (c + n v ) / n

Denominator: 1 + v/(n c) = (n c + v ) / (n c )

So u' is equal to ( (c +n v)/n ) divided by ( (n c + v )/(n c) )

Which is ( (c +n v) /n ) * (n c)/(n c + v )

Simplify:

(n c (c + n v )) / ( n (n c + v) )

The n's cancel out in numerator and denominator:

(c (c + n v )) / ( n c + v )

Wait, the denominator is n c + v. Let's factor that: c(n) + v.

But the numerator is c^2 + c n v.

Wait, let's see. So numerator: c(c +n v ) = c^2 + c n v.

Denominator: c n + v.

Hmm, so we have u' = [c^2 + c n v ] / (c n + v )

Wait, but the options given don't have any c's because the problem states c=1. So substituting c=1:

u' = [1 + n v ] / (n + v )

Because c=1, so c^2 is 1, c n v is n v, and denominator is n + v.

So u' = (1 + n v )/(n + v )

Looking at the options, option A is (1 +n v)/(n +v ), which matches this.

Wait, but wait. Wait, the light is moving through the glass, which is itself moving. But if the glass is moving towards the observer, would that affect the speed? Or is it that the speed of light in the medium is independent of the medium's motion? Hmm, but from the calculation above, we applied the relativistic velocity addition and got a speed that's (1 +n v)/(n +v ), but wait, if v is zero, then the speed is 1/(n), which is correct. Because when the glass is stationary, the speed is c/n = 1/n when c=1. So that makes sense.

So when the glass moves, the observed speed is (1 +n v)/(n +v ). So the answer would be option A.

Wait, but let me double-check the velocity addition formula. Because sometimes the direction can matter. Oh, wait—velocity addition depends on the direction of motion. In this case, since the glass is moving in the same direction as the light, so both u and v are in the same direction. So the formula is correct.

Another way to think: the light's speed in the glass is c/n. The glass is moving at v. So the lab frame would see the light's speed as u' = (c/n + v ) / (1 + (c/n)*v /c² )

Which is (c +n v)/n / ( 1 + v/(n c ) )

With c=1, this becomes (1 +n v)/n / ( (n +v )/(n ) )

Which simplifies again to (1 +n v)/(n +v )

So yeah, option A is correct.

To determine the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory, we apply the relativistic velocity addition formula. In the rest frame of the glass, the speed of light is \( u = \frac{c}{n} \), where \( c = 1 \) (as given) and \( n \) is the refractive index of the glass. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity \( v \) in the same direction as the light beam, towards the observer in the laboratory.

Using the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
u' = \frac{u + v}{1 + \frac{u v}{c^2}}
\]

Substituting \( u = \frac{1}{n} \) and \( c = 1 \), we get:

\[
u' = \frac{\frac{1}{n} + v}{1 + \frac{\frac{1}{n} v}{1}}
\]

Simplify the numerator and denominator:

\[
u' = \frac{\frac{1 + n v}{n}}{1 + \frac{v}{n}}
\]

The denominator can be rewritten as:

\[
1 + \frac{v}{n} = \frac{n + v}{n}
\]

Thus, the expression becomes:

\[
u' = \frac{\frac{1 + n v}{n}}{\frac{n + v}{n}}
\]

The \( n \) in the denominator and numerator cancels out:

\[
u' = \frac{1 + n v}{n + v}
\]

This matches option A. To verify, when \( v = 0 \), the glass is stationary, and the speed of light in the glass is \( \frac{1}{n} \), which is consistent with the given scenario. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: A**
