Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on particle physics, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking for the mean decay distance of a meson X. The given parameters are the production energy EX = 8 GeV, mass mX = 1.2 GeV, and the width ΓX = 320 MeV. The options are A to D, each with different distances in meters.

Wait, I remember that the mean decay distance is related to how long the particle lives before decaying. The longer the lifetime, the farther it can travel before decaying. But how do I calculate that?

Oh right, the mean proper lifetime (τ) of a particle can be found using the uncertainty principle. The relation is Γ = ħ / τ, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. So τ would be ħ divided by Γ. But wait, Γ is given in MeV, and ħ has units of energy·time, so I need to convert units properly.

Hold on, let me jot down the steps I think I should take:

1. Calculate the mean lifetime τ using τ = ħ / Γ.
2. Then, find the velocity of the meson X using its energy and mass.
3. Multiply the velocity by the lifetime τ to get the mean decay distance (L = v * τ).

Wait, but wait. The production energy is higher than the mass. So the meson is moving relativistically, right? So velocity is a significant fraction of the speed of light.

First, let's compute the mean lifetime τ.

The width Γ is 320 MeV. But ħ in natural units (where c=1, ħ=197.328 MeV·fm, I think) would help.

Wait, natural units: 1 GeV^{-1} is about 6.582×10^-25 s. Oh wait, but Γ is in GeV here? Wait, no, Γ is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV.

Alternatively, I can use the formula τ = (ħ c) / (Γ c^2), but I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, let's think in terms of units. The width Γ has units of energy, ħ has units of energy×time. So τ = ħ / Γ. Let's convert ħ to GeV·s.

I remember that ħ is approximately 6.582×10^-25 GeV·s.

So τ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) = (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25 s.

Let me compute that: 6.582 / 0.32 is approximately 20.56875. So τ ≈ 20.56875e-25 s = 2.056875e-24 s.

Wait, is that right? Let me double-check. Oh wait, 0.32 GeV is 320 MeV, but when using ħ in GeV·s, yes, that's correct.

Next step, find the velocity. Since the meson is produced with energy EX =8 GeV and mass mX=1.2 GeV, we can compute the relativistic gamma factor.

The relativistic energy E is given by E = gamma * m c². So gamma = E / (m c²). Since m is in GeV/c², perhaps we can work with units where c=1.

Wait, in natural units where c=1, E = gamma * m, so gamma = E / m =8 / 1.2 ≈6.6667.

So gamma is about 6.6667. Then, the velocity beta (v/c) can be found using gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta²). Let's solve for beta.

Gamma squared is (1 / sqrt(1 - beta²))^2 = 1/(1 - beta²) = gamma².

So 1 - beta² = 1 / gamma² → beta² = 1 - (1/gamma²) → beta = sqrt(1 - 1/(gamma²)).

Compute gamma squared: (6.6667)^2 ≈44.4444.

So 1/(gamma²) is about 0.0225, so 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. Square root is sqrt(0.9775) ≈0.9887.

So beta ≈0.9887 → v ≈0.9887c. So velocity is about 0.9887 times the speed of light, which is approximately 2.965e8 m/s.

Wait, but wait, I think I messed up the units somewhere. Let me think again.

Wait, the speed of light c is approximately 3e8 m/s. So 0.9887c is approximately 2.966e8 m/s. So that's a rough estimate.

Now, the mean decay distance L is v multiplied by the lifetime τ.

So L = v * τ.

We have v ≈0.9887c ≈2.966e8 m/s.

τ is about 2.056875e-24 seconds.

So L = 2.966e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = 2.966e8 * 2.056875e-24 = let's compute that.

Multiply 2.966 * 2.056875 first. 2.966 * 2 ≈5.932, 2.966 * 0.056875 ≈0.1686, so total around 6.1006. Then 6.1006e-16 m.

Wait, because 1e8 * 1e-24 is 1e-16. So 6.1e-16 meters.

Wait, that's about 6e-16 meters. But looking at the options, the closest is option A: 5.0223e-16 m, or C:5.0223e-15.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating tau.

Wait, let me recheck. The calculation of tau.

Tau = ħ / Gamma.

But wait, ħ is 6.582e-25 GeV·s, and Gamma is 0.32 GeV.

So tau = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = let's calculate 6.582 /0.32.

6.582 divided by 0.32 is, let's see: 0.32 *20 =6.4, which is close to 6.582. 20 *0.32=6.4, so 0.182 left. 0.182 /0.32≈0.56875. So total is 20.56875, so tau is 20.56875e-25 s = 2.056875e-24 seconds.

So that part is correct.

So L = v * tau: 0.9887c * 2.056875e-24 s.

Wait, but c is 3e8 m/s, so 0.9887c is 2.966e8 m/s. So L = 2.966e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = (2.966 * 2.056875) * 1e8 *1e-24 m.

Compute 2.966 *2.056875: 2.966 *2 is 5.932. 2.966 *0.056875 ≈ 0.1682. So total ≈6.1002.

So 6.1002e-16 meters. So approximately 6.1e-16 m.

But the options are either around 5e-15 or 5e-16, or 4e-16 or 4e-15.

Hmm, none of the options exactly match 6e-16. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should use more precise values.

Let me re-calculate beta more accurately.

Gamma is 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV =6.66666666667.

Gamma squared is (20/3)^2=400/9≈44.4444444444.

1/gamma squared is 9/400=0.0225.

So 1 - 1/gamma^2 is 0.9775.

The square root of 0.9775 is approximately 0.9887, but let's compute it more accurately.

0.9887^2 is (0.9887)*(0.9887).

Calculate 0.9887 *0.9887:

0.98 *0.98=0.9604.

But more accurately, 0.9887^2 = (0.98 + 0.0087)^2 = 0.98² + 2*0.98*0.0087 + 0.0087².

0.98²=0.9604.

2*0.98*0.0087 = 0.017292.

0.0087²≈0.00007569.

Adding up: 0.9604 +0.017292=0.977692. Adding 0.00007569 gives 0.97776769.

Wait, but 0.9887^2 is approximately 0.97776769, which is a bit higher than 0.9775. So perhaps the actual beta is a bit less than 0.9887.

Wait, let me calculate sqrt(0.9775) more accurately.

Let me think: sqrt(0.9775) = ?

We know that 0.9887^2 is 0.97776769, which is larger than 0.9775. So beta is a little less than 0.9887.

Alternatively, find x where x^2=0.9775.

Let me assume x is approximately between 0.988 and 0.989.

Let me compute 0.988^2: 0.976144.

0.9885^2: let's compute.

0.9885 *0.9885:

= (0.98 +0.0085)^2.

=0.98² + 2*0.98*0.0085 +0.0085².

=0.9604 + 0.01666 + 0.00007225.

=0.9604 +0.01666=0.97706 +0.00007225≈0.97713225.

But 0.9885^2= approx 0.977132.

But we need x^2=0.9775.

So the difference between 0.977132 and 0.9775 is 0.000368.

Each increment of x by 0.0001 increases x^2 by roughly 2*x*0.0001 + (0.0001)^2.

At x=0.9885, 2x=1.977. So each 0.0001 increment in x gives about 1.977 *0.0001 =0.0001977 increase in x^2.

We need an increase of 0.000368.

So 0.000368 / 0.0001977 ≈1.86 times 0.0001. So about 0.000186 added to x.

So x≈0.9885 +0.000186=0.988686.

So sqrt(0.9775)≈0.988686.

So beta is approximately 0.988686, which is very close to 0.9887.

So v is approximately 0.9887c.

So back to v: 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s = approx 2.966e8 m/s.

So L = v * tau.

Tau is 2.056875e-24 seconds.

So L= 2.966e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = multiply 2.966 and 2.056875.

Let me compute 2.966 *2.056875.

2.966 * 2 =5.932.

2.966 *0.056875.

Hmm, 0.05 *2.966=0.1483,

0.006875 *2.966=0.0203225.

So 0.056875 *2.966= 0.1483 +0.0203225=0.1686225.

So total is 5.932 +0.1686225=6.1006225.

So L=6.1006225e-16 m.

Wait, but the options are around 5e-16 or 4e-16. So this suggests perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of tau.

Wait, perhaps I should recheck the calculation of tau.

Tau = ħ / Gamma.

What's the value of ħ in GeV·s?

I think ħ is approximately 6.582 x 10^-25 GeV·s.

Gamma is 0.32 GeV.

So tau=6.582e-25 / 0.32 = let's compute that.

6.582 /0.32=20.56875.

So tau=20.56875e-25 s =2.056875e-24 s.

Which is correct.

Wait, but perhaps I used the wrong unit conversion.

Wait, let me check the units again.

Gamma is in GeV, and ħ is in GeV·s. So when you divide ħ (GeV·s) by Gamma (GeV), you get seconds. So yes, that's correct.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about using natural units differently.

Alternatively, maybe I can compute the decay length using ctau, which is c multiplied by tau.

Because c is 3e8 m/s, tau is 2.056875e-24 s.

So ctau= 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = 6.170625e-16 meters.

But wait, wait, wait. Because the lifetime is tau, and the velocity is v, the decay length is v*tau. But v is 0.9887c, so v*tau= (0.9887c)*tau = 0.9887 * c tau.

So ctau is c * tau =3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s =6.170625e-16 m.

Then v*tau=0.9887 *6.170625e-16 m ≈6.1e-16 m.

But wait, the options don't have 6e-16. Let me double-check the options.

The options are:

A) 5.0223 * 10^-16 m

B)4.0655 * 10^-15 m

C)5.0223 * 10^-15 m

D)4.0655 *10^-16 m

Hmm. So none match exactly. But perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of gamma or beta.

Wait, maybe I should use more precise calculations.

Let me recalculate gamma.

E =8 GeV, m=1.2 GeV.

gamma= E/(m c²) but in natural units, c=1, so gamma=E/m=8/1.2=6.6666666667.

Compute beta: beta = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)).

gamma squared is (20/3)^2=400/9≈44.444444444444.

1/gamma squared is 9/400=0.0225.

So 1 - 0.0225=0.9775.

sqrt(0.9775)= approximately 0.988681.

So beta ≈0.988681.

So v=beta c=0.988681 *3e8 m/s=2.966043e8 m/s.

Tau is 2.056875e-24 s.

So L =v * tau = 2.966043e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.

Compute 2.966043e8 *2.056875e-24.

Multiply the coefficients: 2.966043 *2.056875.

Let me compute that.

2.966043 *2 =5.932086.

2.966043 *0.056875=.

Let me compute 2.966043 *0.05=0.14830215.

2.966043 *0.006875= approx 0.0203128.

Adding these, 0.14830215 +0.0203128≈0.16861495.

So total is 5.932086 +0.16861495=6.10070095.

So L=6.10070095e-16 m.

Hmm, that's about 6.1e-16 m. The options don't have this, but perhaps I made a miscalculation in the initial steps.

Wait, maybe I should consider relativistic gamma in a different way.

Wait, another approach: the mean decay length L is given by (c * tau) multiplied by beta.

Because L= v * t = beta c * t.

And t is the lifetime tau.

So L= beta * c * tau.

So perhaps I can compute c * tau first.

c is 3e8 m/s.

tau= 2.056875e-24 s.

c * tau=3e8 * 2.056875e-24 =6.170625e-16 m.

Then L= beta * (c tau) =0.988681 *6.170625e-16.

Compute 0.988681 *6.170625e-16.

Multiply 0.988681 *6.170625.

0.988681 *6=5.932086.

0.988681 *0.170625= approx 0.1686.

So total approx 6.1007e-16 m.

Same result as before. So L≈6.1e-16 m.

But the options are A and D around 5e-16 and 4e-16.

Hmm. I must be missing something.

Wait, perhaps I should use a more precise value for ħ.

The exact value of ħ in GeV·s is 6.5823×10^-25 GeV·s.

So let me recalculate tau using this more precise value.

tau=6.5823e-25 GeV·s / 0.32 GeV =6.5823e-25 /0.32=20.5696875e-25 s=2.05696875e-24 s.

So a bit more precise.

c * tau=3e8 m/s * 2.05696875e-24 s =6.17090625e-16 m.

Then L=0.988681 *6.17090625e-16.

Compute 0.988681 *6.17090625.

Hmm, 0.988681 *6 =5.932086.

0.988681 *0.17090625=approx 0.1686.

So total is about 6.1007e-16 m.

Same as before.

Wait, maybe I should check the options again.

Options:

A)5.0223e-16 m

B)4.0655e-15 m

C)5.0223e-15 m

D)4.0655e-16 m

Hmm, none of these match 6.1e-16. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of tau.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula for the decay length considering the particle's velocity.

Alternatively, perhaps the mean decay length is given by L = (c * tau) * beta.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the proper lifetime, and then multiply by gamma to get the lab frame lifetime.

Wait, wait a second. Oh! Because the lifetime I calculated is the proper lifetime (tau), but in the lab frame, the lifetime is longer due to time dilation. So tau_lab = gamma * tau.

Wait, wait, no. The proper lifetime is the lifetime in the particle's rest frame, which is tau. In the lab frame, the lifetime is longer by a factor of gamma, so t_lab = gamma * tau.

Ah, I think I made a mistake there. The initial tau is the proper lifetime, so in the lab frame, the lifetime is gamma * tau.

So the decay length L is v * t_lab = v * gamma * tau.

Wait, so let me correct that. Because the lifetime in the lab frame is longer than the proper lifetime.

So L = v * (gamma * tau).

But wait, in the earlier approach, I had L = v * tau, but that's incorrect because tau is the proper lifetime. The lab frame lifetime is gamma tau.

So let's redo the calculation.

tau (proper) = ħ / Gamma.

t_lab = gamma * tau.

So L = v * t_lab = v * gamma * tau.

But v = beta c.

So L = beta c * gamma tau.

But beta gamma is a term that appears in some formulas.

Wait, beta gamma is (v/c) * gamma.

But gamma is 1/sqrt(1-beta^2), so beta gamma = beta / sqrt(1-beta^2).

Alternatively, beta gamma = sqrt(gamma^2 -1).

Because gamma^2 = 1/(1-beta^2) → gamma^2 -1 = beta^2/(1-beta^2) → sqrt(gamma^2 -1) = beta/(sqrt(1-beta^2)) ) = beta gamma.

So beta gamma = sqrt(gamma^2 -1).

So let's compute that.

gamma=6.6667, gamma squared is (20/3)^2=400/9≈44.44444.

gamma squared -1 is 43.44444.

sqrt(43.44444)= approx 6.589.

So beta gamma ≈6.589.

So L= beta gamma * c tau.

But c tau is what I calculated as 6.1709e-16 m.

So L=6.589 *6.1709e-16 m.

Wait, no, wait. Because L= beta gamma * c tau.

Wait, because c tau is c multiplied by the proper lifetime tau. But beta gamma is a factor.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me re-express this.

L = v * t_lab.

t_lab = gamma * tau.

v = beta c.

So L= beta c * gamma tau.

Which is beta gamma c tau.

But c tau is in meters.

But what's the value of c tau?

c is 3e8 m/s, tau is 2.056875e-24 s.

So c tau=3e8 *2.056875e-24 =6.170625e-16 m.

Then, L = beta gamma * c tau.

So beta gamma is approx 6.589.

So L=6.589 *6.170625e-16 m.

6.589 *6.170625 is approx?

6 *6.170625=37.02375.

0.589 *6.170625≈3.636.

So total≈37.02375 +3.636=40.65975.

So L≈40.65975e-16 m =4.065975e-15 m.

Wait, that's around 4.065975e-15 m. Which is option B, but option B is 4.0655e-15 m. So it's very close.

Wait the calculation gives 4.066e-15 m, but option B is 4.0655e-15 m.

Hmm, perhaps the precise calculation would give 4.0655e-15 m.

So that must be option B.

Wait, but I thought the earlier approach didn't account for the gamma factor. So I think that's where I went wrong earlier.

Wait, to recap:

- Proper lifetime tau = ħ / Gamma =6.5823e-25 /0.32=2.05696875e-24 s.

- Lab frame lifetime t_lab = gamma * tau.

- Decay length L= v * t_lab = beta c * gamma tau.

But beta gamma= sqrt(gamma^2 -1)=sqrt( (8/1.2)^2 -1 )=sqrt( (6.6667)^2 -1 )=sqrt(44.444 -1 )=sqrt(43.444)= approx 6.589.

So L= beta gamma c tau.

c tau is 3e8 m/s *2.05696875e-24 s=6.17090625e-16 m.

Multiply by beta gamma=6.589.

6.17090625e-16 *6.589= approx let's compute 6e-16 *6.589=3.953e-15.

But more accurately:

6.17090625e-16 *6.589.

Let me compute 6.17090625 *6.589.

6 *6.589=39.534.

0.17090625 *6.589≈approx 1.123.

So total≈40.657.

So 40.657e-16 meters=4.0657e-15 meters.

Which is very close to option B: 4.0655e-15 m.

So the correct answer should be option B.

Wait, but in the initial approach, I didn't include the gamma factor, which led to a lower value. So that was the mistake. The decay length isn't just v multiplied by proper lifetime, but v multiplied by the dilated lifetime, which is gamma times tau.

So the correct approach is to multiply by gamma, leading to a larger L.

So the correct answer is option B:4.0655e-15 m.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the mean decay distance of the meson resonance \( X \), we use the following steps:

1. **Calculate the proper lifetime (\( \tau \))**:  
   The proper lifetime is given by \( \tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma} \), where \( \hbar \) is the reduced Planck's constant and \( \Gamma \) is the width of the resonance. Using \( \hbar \approx 6.5823 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV·s} \) and \( \Gamma = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \):  
   \[
   \tau = \frac{6.5823 \times 10^{-25}}{0.32} = 2.05696875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}.
   \]

2. **Relate the lab-frame lifetime (\( t_{\text{lab}} \)) to the proper lifetime**:  
   Due to time dilation, the lab-frame lifetime is \( t_{\text{lab}} = \gamma \tau \), where \( \gamma \) is the Lorentz factor. The Lorentz factor is calculated as:  
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{E}{m} = \frac{8 \, \text{GeV}}{1.2 \, \text{GeV}} = 6.6667.
   \]  
   Thus, \( t_{\text{lab}} = 6.6667 \times 2.05696875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s} \).

3. **Calculate the velocity (\( v \)) of the meson**:  
   The velocity is determined using \( \beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}} \). Substituting \( \gamma = 6.6667 \):  
   \[
   \beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{(6.6667)^2}} = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{44.4444}} = \sqrt{0.9775} \approx 0.9887.
   \]  
   Therefore, \( v = \beta c \approx 0.9887 \times 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} = 2.966 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \).

4. **Calculate the mean decay distance (\( L \))**:  
   The mean decay distance is \( L = v \cdot t_{\text{lab}} \). Substituting \( v = 2.966 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \) and \( t_{\text{lab}} = \gamma \tau \):  
   \[
   L = (2.966 \times 10^8) \cdot (6.6667 \cdot 2.05696875 \times 10^{-24}) \, \text{m}.
   \]  
   First, calculate \( \gamma \cdot \tau \):  
   \[
   \gamma \cdot \tau = 6.6667 \cdot 2.05696875 \times 10^{-24} = 1.3713 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{s}.
   \]  
   Then, calculate \( L \):  
   \[
   L = (2.966 \times 10^8) \cdot (1.3713 \times 10^{-23}) = 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}.
   \]

5. **Compare with the options**:  
   The calculated value \( L = 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \) matches option **B**.

**Final Answer**:  
B) \( 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \).
