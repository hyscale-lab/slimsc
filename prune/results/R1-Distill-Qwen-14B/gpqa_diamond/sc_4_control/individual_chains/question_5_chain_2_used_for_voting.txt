Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n lying in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. 

Hmm, wait, the operator is P, and it's along some direction n in the x-z plane. Oh, right, I remember that for spin-½ particles, the Pauli matrices represent the spin operators. So the operator P is probably the spin operator component along direction n. The components P_x, P_y, and P_z are given as matrices multiplied by ħ/2.

Wait, let me read the problem again. The X-component, P_x, is ħ/2 times a 2x2 matrix with first row (0,1) and second row (1,0). Similarly for P_y and P_z. So these are the standard Pauli matrices multiplied by ħ/2. So each P component is (ħ/2) * sigma, where sigma is the Pauli matrix for that component.

So the operator P along direction n would be the sum of the components multiplied by the direction cosines. Since n is in the x-z plane, the direction cosines would be (l, 0, m), where l is along x and m along z. So the operator P would be something like P = (P_x * l) + (P_z * m), because the y-component is zero.

Wait, but actually, the general form for the spin operator in direction n is P = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z. Since n is in the x-z plane, n_y is zero. So P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z. 

We can write this as (n_x * (ħ/2) σ_x) + (n_z * (ħ/2) σ_z). Let me factor out ħ/2 to make it simpler: P = (ħ/2) (n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z). 

Now, the eigenvalue equation is P |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>. Since the eigenvalue is +ħ/2, the equation becomes (n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z) |ψ> = I |ψ>, where I is the identity matrix. So the eigenvalue equation for the matrix (n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z) is 1. 

Wait, but σ_x and σ_z are 2x2 Pauli matrices. So, the matrix here is a 2x2 matrix given by:

n_x * [[0,1],[1,0]] + n_z * [[1,0],[0,-1]] = [[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]]

So the matrix becomes:

[ [n_z, n_x],
  [n_x, -n_z] ]

We need to find the eigenvectors of this matrix for eigenvalue 1. 

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to approach this problem by considering that the operator P has eigenvalue +ħ/2, so the eigenvector should be the eigenstate corresponding to spin-up along the direction n. For a spin-½ particle, the eigenvector can be expressed in terms of the spherical harmonics or using the eigenstates of spin in direction n.

Wait, another approach: the eigenvectors for spin in an arbitrary direction can be written as a superposition of the eigenstates of the z-component. The general form is something like:

|+n> = cos(θ/2) |↑> + e^{iφ} sin(θ/2)|↓>

But wait, no. Because the direction is in the x-z plane, φ would be zero, right? Because in the x-z plane, the angle φ (azimuthal angle) is zero. So φ is the angle around the z-axis, so if the direction is in x-z, then φ=0 or π. But in this case, since the direction is arbitrary in x-z, perhaps we can assume φ=0 for simplicity. So the eigenvector would be cos(θ/2) |↑> + sin(θ/2)|↓>.

Wait, but wait, the spin-up state along direction (l, m) in spherical coordinates (where m is the z-component) can be expressed as:

|+> = e^{-i φ/2} cos(θ/2) |↑> + e^{i φ/2} sin(θ/2) |↓> ?

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think. The general spin-up state in direction n is given by:

|n+> = cos(θ/2) |↑> + e^{i φ} sin(θ/2) |↓>

But in this problem, the direction is in the x-z plane, which implies that φ is zero or π. Wait, no, the x-z plane corresponds to φ=0 and φ=π. Because when you're in the x-z plane, the angle around the z-axis (φ) is 0 or π. So for our problem, direction n is in x-z, so φ=0. Because in spherical coordinates, the azimuthal angle φ is measured in the x-y plane from the x-axis. So if the direction is in x-z, the projection onto the x-y plane is zero, so φ=0.

Wait, no, actually, when the direction is in the x-z plane, it's like looking along the y-axis. So the point on the unit sphere is in the x-z plane. So the polar angle θ is measured from the z-axis, and the azimuthal angle φ is measured in the x-y plane. So when the point is in the x-z plane, φ is either 0 or π, depending on whether it's in the positive x or negative x direction.

But in any case, for our problem, the direction n is in the x-z plane, so let's take φ=0 for simplicity. So the eigenvector would be:

|n+> = cos(θ/2) |↑> + sin(θ/2) |↓>

But wait, in that case, the components would be [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ]^T.

Wait, but wait, I'm getting this from the general formula. Another way is to write the eigenvectors for the matrix [[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]] with eigenvalue 1.

The eigenvalue equation is:

[ [n_z, n_x]   [a]   = 1 * [a]
  [n_x, -n_z]  [b]     [b] ]

So,

n_z a + n_x b = a → (n_z - 1) a + n_x b = 0

n_x a -n_z b = b → n_x a + (-n_z - 1) b = 0

Wait, let me re-derive the equations. The first equation is:

n_z a + n_x b = (1) a → (n_z - 1) a + n_x b = 0.

The second equation is:

n_x a -n_z b = (1) b → n_x a + (-n_z - 1) b = 0.

So, from the first equation: (n_z -1) a = -n_x b → a = [ -n_x / (n_z -1) ] b.

But wait, let's write the two equations:

1. (n_z -1) a + n_x b = 0
2. n_x a + (-n_z -1) b = 0

We can write this as a system of linear equations. To find the eigenvector, we can express a in terms of b from the first equation and plug into the second.

From equation 1: a = [ -n_x b ] / (n_z - 1 )

Substituting into equation 2:

n_x [ (-n_x b)/(n_z -1) ) ] + (-n_z -1) b = 0.

Let me compute this:

n_x * (-n_x) b / (n_z -1) + (-n_z -1) b = 0 → [ (-n_x^2) / (n_z -1) ) + (-n_z -1) ] b = 0.

Factor out b:

[ (-n_x^2)/(n_z -1) - (n_z + 1) ) ] b = 0.

Since b can't be zero (otherwise a would be zero too, leading to trivial solution), the bracket must be zero:

(-n_x^2)/(n_z -1) - (n_z +1) ) = 0 → (-n_x^2)/(n_z -1) = (n_z +1).

Multiply both sides by (n_z - 1):

- n_x^2 = (n_z +1)(n_z -1) → -n_x^2 = n_z^2 -1 → n_z^2 + n_x^2 = 1.

Which makes sense because n is a unit vector, so n_x² + n_z² =1.

Therefore, the equations are consistent, and the eigenvector is determined up to a scalar multiple. So choosing a in terms of b as a = [ -n_x / (n_z -1) ] b.

Let me choose b = 1. Then a = -n_x / (n_z -1).

But wait, perhaps it's easier to express the eigenvector in terms of θ, the polar angle.

Since n is in the x-z plane, we can parameterize it with θ, the angle from the z-axis, and φ=0 (as discussed earlier). So, n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ.

Wait, no, because in spherical coordinates, when φ=0, the direction is along the x-axis. Wait, no, when φ=0, the direction is along the x-axis (as per convention). Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting this mixed up.

Wait, in spherical coordinates, θ is the polar angle (angle from the positive z-axis), and φ is the azimuthal angle (angle in the x-y plane from the x-axis). So when φ=0, you're in the x-z plane, pointing along the x-axis. So n_x = sinθ cosφ = sinθ * 1, and n_z = cosθ.

Wait, no, the components are:

n_x = sinθ cosφ

n_y = sinθ sinφ

n_z = cosθ

Since φ=0 in this case (because we're in x-z plane), n_x = sinθ * 1 = sinθ, and n_z = cosθ.

So n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ.

Substituting into a's expression: a = [ -n_x ] / (n_z - 1) → a = [ - sinθ ] / (cosθ -1 )

Simplify denominator: cosθ -1 → -2 sin²(θ/2) → denominator: -2 sin²(θ/2)

Numerator: - sinθ = - 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2)

So a = [ -2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2) ] / [ -2 sin²(θ/2) ) ] = [ -2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2) ] / [ -2 sin²(θ/2) ) ]

The negatives cancel, and 2 cancels, sin(θ/2) cancels:

= [ cos(θ/2) ] / [ sin(θ/2) ]

→ a = cot(θ/2) = [cos(θ/2)] / [sin(θ/2)]

Wait, so a = cos(θ/2) / sin(θ/2) = cot(θ/2).

But perhaps it's easier to write the ratio a/b as [ cos(θ/2) ] / [ sin(θ/2) ].

Wait, because if I set b= sin(θ/2), then a= cos(θ/2).

So the eigenvector would be [ a, b ] = [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ].

Wait, but let me check using the earlier substitution. If a = [ -n_x ] / [n_z -1 ] and n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ,

a = [ - sinθ ] / (cosθ -1 )

Multiply numerator and denominator by (cosθ + 1):

= [ - sinθ (cosθ +1) ] / [ (cosθ -1)(cosθ +1) ]

Denominator: cos²θ -1 = -sin²θ.

So,

a = [ - sinθ (cosθ +1) ] / (- sin²θ ) = [ sinθ (cosθ +1) ] / sin²θ

Simplify: (cosθ +1)/(sinθ ) = [2 cos²(θ/2)] / [2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2) ) ] → [ cos(θ/2) ] / [ sin(θ/2) ] → cot(θ/2 )

Hmm, but perhaps another approach would be better. Let's consider the eigenvector. The eigenvector for eigenvalue +1 is in the direction of the spin-up state along n.

The general form for the spin-up state along direction (θ, φ) is:

|+n> = e^{-i φ/2} cos(θ/2) |↑> + e^{i φ/2} sin(θ/2) |↓>

But in our case, since n is in the x-z plane, φ is zero. So,

|+n> = cos(θ/2) |↑> + sin(θ/2) |↓>

Which would correspond to the eigenvector [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ]^T.

But wait, the eigenvector needs to be normalized. The norm would be sqrt( cos²(θ/2) + sin²(θ/2) ) = 1, so it's already normalized.

So the elements of the normalized eigenvector are cos(θ/2) and sin(θ/2).

Looking at the options, let's see:

Option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which matches this.

Option D has sqrt(2/3) and sqrt(1/3) factors multiplied by cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2), respectively. But our calculation doesn't have these factors; the eigenvector is just in terms of theta/2.

Wait, but perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think again about the operator.

Wait, the operator P given is for a muon, which is a spin-½ particle. The operator components are given as P_x = (ħ/2) σ_x, etc. So the operator in direction n is P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z = (ħ/2)(n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z).

The eigenvalue equation is P |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>.

So, [n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z ] |ψ> = I |ψ>.

Thus, the matrix [[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]] has eigenvalue 1. The eigenvector for that matrix is [a, b] such that:

n_z a + n_x b = a → (n_z -1) a + n_x b = 0,

n_x a -n_z b = b → n_x a + (-n_z -1) b =0.

From the first equation, a = [n_x/(1 - n_z)] b.

Substituting into the second equation:

n_x [n_x/(1 -n_z)] b + (-n_z -1) b =0 → [ (n_x^2) / (1-n_z) ) + (-n_z -1) ] b =0.

Factor out (1-n_z):

[ n_x^2 + (-n_z -1)(1-n_z) ) ] b / (1 -n_z ) = 0.

Wait, maybe let me compute the numerator:

n_x^2 + (-n_z -1)(1 -n_z) = n_x^2 + [ (-n_z)(1) + (-n_z)(-n_z) ) + (-1)(1) + (-1)(-n_z) ]

Wait, this is getting complicated. Another approach: since n_x^2 + n_z^2 =1,

We can write the equation as:

n_x^2 = (1 - n_z^2 )

Substituting into the equation,

(1 - n_z^2 ) / (1 -n_z ) + (-n_z -1 ) ) = 0.

Simplify (1 -n_z^2 ) = (1-n_z)(1 +n_z ), so,

( (1-n_z)(1 +n_z ) ) / (1-n_z) ) + (-n_z -1 ) = (1 +n_z ) + (-n_z -1 ) = 0.

So it's consistent, and the eigenvector is correct.

So the eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Looking at the options, option C says (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which matches.

But wait, the options are a bit more detailed. Let me check the options again:

Option C: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2))

But wait, the question says "the elements of the normalized eigenvector", so this should be correct.

Wait, but wait, in option D, the elements have factors of sqrt(2/3) and sqrt(1/3), multiplied by cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2), respectively. Hmm, but why would that be the case?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the direction. Wait, the direction n is arbitrary in the x-z plane. So the angle theta is the angle from the z-axis. So the components are n_x = sin(theta), n_z = cos(theta).

Wait, but in the eigenvector, perhaps another normalization factor comes in, but I thought it was already normalized.

Wait, let me check the eigenvector:

The eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ], which has a norm of sqrt( cos^2(theta/2) + sin^2(theta/2) ) =1. So it's normalized.

Looking at the options, option C is the only one that matches this form.

So the answer should be option C.

To solve the problem, we need to find the normalized eigenvector of the operator $\vec{P}$ for a muon along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ lying in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The operator $\vec{P}$ is constructed using the components $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$, which are proportional to the Pauli matrices. Since $\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane, the direction cosines are $n_x$ (along x) and $n_z$ (along z), with $n_y = 0$. The operator $\vec{P}$ along $\vec{n}$ is given by:

\[
\vec{P} = n_x P_x + n_z P_z = \frac{\hbar}{2} \left( n_x \sigma_x + n_z \sigma_z \right),
\]

where $\sigma_x = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}$ and $\sigma_z = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix}$. Substituting these, the matrix representation of $\vec{P}$ becomes:

\[
\vec{P} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} n_z & n_x \\ n_x & -n_z \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvalue equation is:

\[
\vec{P} |\psi\rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} |\psi\rangle,
\]

which simplifies to:

\[
\begin{bmatrix} n_z & n_x \\ n_x & -n_z \end{bmatrix} |\psi\rangle = I |\psi\rangle,
\]

where $I$ is the identity matrix. This implies the eigenvalue is $1$ for the matrix $\begin{bmatrix} n_z & n_x \\ n_x & -n_z \end{bmatrix}$. The eigenvector $|\psi\rangle$ can be expressed as:

\[
|\psi\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix},
\]

where $a$ and $b$ satisfy the eigenvalue equation. Solving the system of equations derived from the eigenvalue problem, the eigenvector is found to be:

\[
|\psi\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} \cos(\theta/2) \\ \sin(\theta/2) \end{bmatrix},
\]

where $\theta$ is the polar angle from the z-axis, and $\phi = 0$ since $\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane. This eigenvector is already normalized, as the norm is:

\[
\sqrt{\cos^2(\theta/2) + \sin^2(\theta/2)} = 1.
\]

Comparing this result with the given options:

- **Option A**: $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar, \sqrt{1/3}\hbar)$ — This does not match the derived eigenvector.
- **Option B**: $(\cos(\theta), e^{i\phi}\sin(\theta))$ — This is incorrect because the eigenvector depends on $\theta/2$, not $\theta$.
- **Option C**: $(\cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2))$ — This matches the derived eigenvector exactly.
- **Option D**: $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar \cos(\theta/2), \sqrt{1/3}\hbar \sin(\theta/2))$ — This introduces unnecessary normalization factors and is incorrect.

Thus, the correct answer is **Option C**.
