Okay, let's tackle this chemistry problem. Hmm, it's about determining the molecular formula of an aromatic compound based on spectroscopic data. So, I'll need to think about the IR and NMR data given.

First, the compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. That means it's something like benzene with two substituents, right? So, the structure would be similar to phenol derivatives or maybe an aromatic ester.

The FTIR shows an ester group. Esters have a carbonyl (C=O) stretch around 1700-1750 cm⁻¹. So, the IR is pointing towards an ester functional group. That makes me think that the substituents on the benzene ring could be ester groups or maybe an ester and something else.

Now, looking at the 1H NMR spectrum. The description says six signals. Let me break them down:

1. Two aromatic H signals: So, the aromatic ring has two distinct sets of protons. Since it's a di-substituted benzene, the substituents are in positions that cause the aromatic protons to split into two groups. For example, if the substituents are para to each other, the aromatic protons might be split into a para pattern, but wait, no, para would have two sets. Wait, di-substituted can be ortho, meta, or para. If it's para, there are two equivalent H environments. If it's meta, maybe three, but the question says two aromatic signals. So probably para substitution. Because in para, each substituent is opposite each other, making two equivalent sets of aromatic protons. Like each substituent is at the 1 and 4 positions, causing the H's at 2 and 6 to be equivalent, and 3 and 5 equivalent. So two signals.

2. Two vinyl H signals: One is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets. Vinyl protons are typically on a double bond, like in an ester group. Ester groups have the structure R-O-CO-O-R, but wait, more accurately, it's R-O-CO-OR'. No, wait, esters are R-O-CO-R. So the structure would have a carbonyl group and an oxygen linked to an R group. But where do the vinyl Hs come in? Oh, wait, maybe the substituents on the benzene are ester groups with some double bonds. Or perhaps the substituents themselves have vinyl protons. Hmm.

Wait, if one substituent is an ester, maybe the other substituent is something else. But the aromatic Hs are two signals, so maybe the substituents are in positions that cause that.

Wait, the NMR says two vinyl H signals. One is a doublet, the other is a doublet of quartets. That suggests coupling with adjacent protons. For example, if there's a vinyl group next to an oxygen, like in an ester group. Let me think of an ester group attached to the benzene ring. For example, maybe the substituent is a propenoate group, like O-CO-OCH2CH2CH3. No, wait, that's a propenoate ester. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent has a double bond adjacent to the ester group.

Wait, maybe the substituent is an ester group connected to a vinyl group. So like, the benzene has an ester substituent which is linked to a vinyl group (like CH2CH2COO- attached). Hmm, but let me think about the NMR signals.

The vinyl Hs: one is a doublet and the other is a doublet of quartets. So, perhaps the vinyl group is adjacent to an oxygen, causing that splitting.

Wait, another possibility is that the substituent is a methoxycarbonyl group. No, that wouldn't have vinyl H. Maybe the substituent is a carbonyl group attached to another group that has vinyl Hs.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is an ester group where the R group is a vinyl group. Like, maybe it's an acrylate ester. For example, something like benzene with a substituent like O-CO-CH2CH2CH3. Wait, no, that's an ethyl ester. Acrylate would be O-CO-CH2CH=CH2. Hmm, but then the vinyl Hs would be on the CH2CH=CH2 part.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a group with a double bond, like a styryl group (like CH2=CHCOO- attached to benzene? No, that's more of a propenoate ester.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl group attached through oxygen. Wait, maybe it's an ester with a vinyl group, like O-CO-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, that's an ethyl ester. Maybe O-CO-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, but that's a pentyl ester. No, I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a benzyl group with a double bond elsewhere. Wait, maybe the substituent is a butyl group with a double bond, but I'm getting stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the substitution is a vinyl group attached via an oxygen, like an ether linkage, but that wouldn't explain the ester in the IR.

Wait, maybe one of the substituents is an ester, and the other is a vinyl group. But the aromatic ring would have two substituents, an ester and a vinyl group. But then, wait, the vinyl group would be part of the ring? No, that doesn't make sense. The substituents on the benzene ring are usually groups attached via a single bond.

Wait, maybe the substituents are both ester groups, but that's unlikely because di-substituted usually refers to two different groups.

Hmm, perhaps the substituents are an ester group and a methoxy group. But that doesn't account for the vinyl Hs.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a propenoate ester. So, for example, the substituent is O-CO-CH2-CH2-CH3, but that's an ethyl propenoate? Wait, no, that's but maybe O-CO-CH2CH2CH2... no. Wait, perhaps the substituent is O-CO-CH2-CH2-CH2-O-R? No, that seems too complicated.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is an ester group where the R group is a vinyl group, like O-CO-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, that's just a longer ester. Wait, I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a benzoyl group, but that's a ketone, not an ester. So, perhaps the substituent is an ester group attached to a ring, but that doesn't explain the vinyl Hs.

Wait, maybe the substituents are both ester groups, but that would complicate the structure. Alternatively, perhaps one substituent is an ester, and the other is a vinyl group attached via another oxygen. Wait, like a glycol ester or something. Hmm, not sure.

Let me think about the NMR signals again. The aromatic has two H groups, so maybe the substituents are para to each other. Then, the aromatic protons would be in two sets of two, each as doublets. But the NMR says two signals for aromatic H, but their splitting depends on substituents. If the substituents are strong de-shielders, the neighboring Hs would change.

But perhaps I should think about the vinyl Hs. There are two signals, one doublet and one doublet of quartets. So, perhaps the vinyl group is in a structure where each H is adjacent to different environments.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a group like CH2=CH-O-CO- attached to benzene. So, benzene-O-CO-CH2-CH2-... No, wait, that's an ester. Let me think: perhaps the substituent is an ester where the R group is a vinyl group. For example, benzene-O-CO-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, but that's a propyl group. Wait, no, if the R group is a vinyl, like CH2=CH-.

Wait, let's consider an ester substituent like O-CO-CH2CH2CH2. No, that's a propyl group. Or O-CO-CH2CH2CH3 (ethyl propionate?), but that doesn't give vinyl Hs.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a group like CH2=CHCOO- attached to the benzene. So, benzene-O-CO-CH2-CH2-CH2. No, that's not right. Wait, O-CO-CH2-CH2-CH2 would be a butyl group, but that doesn't have a double bond.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propenoate ester, like O-CO-CH2-CH2-CH2 is not right. Wait, propenoate would be O-CO-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, that's butyl. Wait, no, propenoate is O-CO-CH2-CH2-CH2?

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the possible structures that would fit the NMR.

We have two vinyl H signals: a doublet and a doublet of quartets.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a group with a double bond adjacent to an oxygen. For example, an allyl group attached to an oxygen.

Wait, benzene-O-CH2-CH2-CH2-COO-R? No, that's a longer chain.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a group like CH2=CH-O-CO- attached. So, the ester would be R-O-CO- attached to the benzene. For example, benzene-O-CO-CH2-CH2-CH3. But then, where are the vinyl Hs? Oh! Wait, maybe the substituent is a propenoate ester. So the structure would be benzene-O-CO-CH2-CH2-CH2? No, I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an acrylate group, which would have a double bond. So, benzene-O-CO-CH2-CH2-CH3 is a propyl ester, but that doesn't have a double bond. Acrylate would be benzene-O-CO-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond somewhere. Wait, acrylate is CH2=CHCOO- attached. So, benzene-O-CO-CH2-CH2-CH2? No, that's not right. Alternatively, benzene-O-CO-CH2-CH2-CH3 is butyl, but that's not a vinyl.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl group attached via an ester. So, benzene-O-CO-CH2-CH2-CH2... No, that's not a vinyl. Oh, wait, maybe the substituent is a group like CH2=CH-O-CO- attached. But then, the ester would be O-CO-(CH2=CH-O-) attached to benzene. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a vinyl group attached to an ester. For example, the substituent is O-CO-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, which is a butyl ester. But that doesn't have a double bond. So, maybe the substituent is O-CO-CH2-CH=CH2. So, that would be a propenoate ester.

In that case, the substituent would be O-CO-CH2-CH=CH2. So, the structure would be benzene-O-CO-CH2-CH=CH2.

Wait, but that would lead to two vinyl Hs. Let me think about the NMR.

The double bond in CH2-CH=CH2 would have two sets of Hs. The CH2 adjacent to the ester would have Hs that are next to the CH=CH2 group.

Wait, the structure would be O-CO-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, that's butyl. Wait, the substituent is O-CO-CH2-CH=CH2, which is an allyl ester or something like that.

So, the substituent is O-CO-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, but that's butyl. Wait, maybe O-CO-CH2-CH=CH2 is the substituent.

In that case, the CH2 next to the double bond would have Hs that are next to the double bond. The vinyl protons would be on the CH=CH2 part.

So, the CH=CH2 group would have two protons. One on each carbon.

Wait, so each CH2 adjacent to the double bond would have different coupling.

Wait, the structure would be O-CO-CH2-CH2-CH2... Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a methoxycarbonyl group attached to a vinyl group.

Wait, another approach: let's count the number of protons in each NMR signal.

The aromatic has two signals, let's say each with 2 Hs each (so 4 aromatic Hs total). Then, the vinyl Hs: two signals, each with 2 Hs (so 4 vinyl Hs). And the –CH3 groups: two signals, each with 3 Hs (so 6 CH3 Hs). Wait, but wait, the NMR says six signals in total. Let me recount:

- Two aromatic signals: each 2 H? Or maybe one is 2 H and the other 4 H? Wait, no, benzene is 6 Hs. If it's di-substituted, each substituent affects the adjacent Hs. So if substituents are para, each substituent would cause two Hs on either side. For example, in para substitution, each substituent is opposite each other, so the Hs are in two pairs. So each aromatic H signal could be 2 H each, totaling 4 H. Wait, that's not possible because a benzene ring has 6 Hs. Hmm, maybe the substituents are such that they cause three equivalent Hs for each substituent. Wait, maybe the substituents are in the meta positions. Wait, no, if the substituents are para, then you have two sets, each with two Hs. Wait, but that's four Hs. There are six Hs in benzene, so what about the other two?

Wait, perhaps the substituents are such that they cause four aromatic Hs and two more elsewhere. No, I'm getting stuck.

Alternatively, maybe the substituents are in positions that cause only two types of aromatic protons. For example, if one substituent is in position 1 and another in position 3, causing three distinct Hs? Hmm, but the question says two aromatic signals, so probably the substituents are para.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are in para positions, making two sets of two Hs each. So each substituent is para, so their adjacent Hs are equivalent. So each substituent has two adjacent Hs, making two signals each of 2 H.

Wait, but that would account for four Hs. But benzene has six Hs. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, maybe each substituent is such that it splits the ring into two distinct sets of two Hs each. So, the two substituents are para, causing each adjacent position to have equivalent Hs. So, each substituent's adjacent positions have two Hs each, but that's four Hs. So the two substituents would account for four Hs, but where are the other two? Hmm, perhaps one substituent is a strong de-shielder, causing some Hs to be split into a different environment. I'm getting a bit stuck.

But maybe I should focus on the substituents' structure. The substituent has an ester group, so one substituent is O-CO-R, where R is some group. The other substituent must be another group, but what? The NMR shows CH3 groups. So, perhaps the substituent R is a methyl group. Like O-CO-CH3.

Wait, but if the substituent is O-CO-CH3, then that's an acetate group. So the structure would be para-substituted with two acetate groups? But that would give a formula with more oxygen atoms. Wait, no, the formula options are C11H12O2, etc. Let me check.

Wait, the molecular formula is to be determined. Let's think about the possible structures.

If the substituents are two ester groups, each O-CO-R, but perhaps R is a methyl group. Wait, but two ester groups would require more oxygens. Let me calculate.

Alternatively, perhaps one substituent is an ester group and the other is a methyl group. Wait, but the NMR has two CH3 signals, so maybe the substituent is a group with two CH3 groups.

Wait, the NMR shows two –CH3 groups, each as a singlet? No, the description says two signals for –CH3, which could mean two different –CH3 groups.

So, perhaps the substituent is an ester group with a –CH2CH3 group. Wait, no, that would give a CH2 group, but the NMR says no CH2 signals. The question states that there are no signals for –CH2 groups, so the structure cannot have any CH2 groups.

Wait a minute! The 1H NMR has two signals for –CH3 groups. So the substituent must have two different –CH3 groups. So, perhaps the substituent is a group like –O–CO–CH2–CH2–CO–O–? No, that's getting complicated.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a group that has two –CH3 groups attached. Like, maybe a gem-dimethyl group. But that's unlikely in an ester. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an ester where the R group is a tert-butyl group (C(CH3)3). But that would have nine CH3 Hs, but the NMR has only two signals for –CH3.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a group with two separate –CH3 groups. For example, if the substituent is –O–CO–CH2–C(CH3)2. But that would require the R group to have a branching. But then, the CH2 would be a CH2 group, which would show up in the NMR as a –CH2 signal, but the NMR data says there are no –CH2 signals. So that's not possible.

Hmm. So, the substituent's R group cannot have any –CH2 groups. So, the R group must be a group without any CH2, perhaps a –CH3 group or a –C(CH3)2 group, etc.

Wait, if the substituent is O-CO-CH(CH3)2, but that would give a –CH(CH3)2 group, which has no CH2 groups. So, the substituent would be O-CO-C(CH3)2. Then, the R group is C(CH3)2, which is isopropyl. Wait, no, isopropyl is CH(CH3)2. So, the substituent would be O-CO-CH(CH3)2.

But then, the CH(CH3)2 group would have a –CH– group attached to two CH3 groups. So, the H on the CH would be split into a multiplet, but the CH3 groups would each be singlets? No, but the NMR shows two –CH3 signals, so maybe they are not equivalent.

Alternatively, the substituent R group could be a –CH(CH3)2, leading to two –CH3 groups. But wait, if R is –CH(CH3)2, then the substituent is O-CO-CH(CH3)2. The H on the CH would be a singlet, but the two –CH3 groups would be equivalent, giving one signal. But the NMR has two –CH3 signals, so that can't be.

Hmm, maybe the substituent R group is –CH2–C(CH3)3? No, that would introduce a CH2 group, which is not allowed.

Wait, perhaps the substituent has two separate –CH3 groups attached to different carbons, each with their own distinct environment. For example, if the substituent is O-CO-CH2-C(CH3)2. But that would have a –CH2– group, which is not allowed. So that's out.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent R group is a –C(CH3)2 group, so the substituent is O-CO-C(CH3)2. That would have three CH3 groups attached to the central carbon. But that would give a single –CH3 signal, not two.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is O-CO-CH(CH2CH3)2. No, that would have CH2 groups.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is O-CO-CH3 (methyl ester) and another substituent is a –CH3 group. But then, the substituents are O-CO-CH3 and –CH3. But that would make the aromatic ring have two substituents: an ester and a methyl group. But then, how do the NMR signals add up?

Wait, the substituent is O-CO-CH3 (one substituent) and another substituent, say, a –CH3 group. Then, the aromatic would have two substituents: O-CO-CH3 and –CH3. But that would cause the aromatic protons to split into two groups. Let me think about the structure:

Ph-O-CO-CH3 and Ph-CH3. But wait, that's two substituents on the benzene ring, para to each other. Then, the aromatic protons would be in two sets: two Hs and two Hs each, making two signals. So that could fit.

But then, the NMR would have:

- Two aromatic signals (probably two doublets, each 2 H).

- The ester group's O-CO-CH3 would have a CH3 as a singlet? Because it's attached to the ester oxygen.

- The substituent –CH3 would be attached directly to the benzene. So, that would be a singlet as well. So, two –CH3 signals.

But the NMR says two signals for –CH3, so that fits. But what about the vinyl Hs?

Wait, the substituent O-CO-CH3 is an ester but doesn't have any vinyl Hs. But the NMR shows two vinyl H signals. So that can't be. So, perhaps the substituent has a vinyl group.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is O-CO-CH2-CH2-CH2... No, that brings CH2 groups which aren't present.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is O-CO-CH2-CH2-CH3, but that's a propyl ester. But that would bring CH2 groups, which aren't allowed.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Let's think about the possible molecular formulas.

The options are C11H12O2, C11H14O2, C12H12O2, C12H14O2.

Each option has different degrees of unsaturation. Let's calculate for each.

The formula for degrees of unsaturation (DoU) is DoU = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no X or N here.

Option A: C11H14O2
DoU = (2*11 +2 -14 -0)/2 = (24 -14)/2=5. So, 5 DoU. Benzene (3 DoU) plus two ester groups (each ester is a carbonyl, which is 1 DoU each). But wait, an ester is one carbonyl per ester. So two ester groups would add two DoU. Benzene is 3. So total 5, which matches. So, possible.

Option B: C12H14O2
DoU = (2*12 +2 -14)/2 = (26-14)/2=6. Benzene (3) + 2 ester groups (2) =5. So, DoU would need to be 6, so there must be an additional DoU. Maybe a double bond or a ring elsewhere.

Option C: C12H12O2
DoU = (2*12 +2 -12)/2= (26-12)/2=7. Benzene (3) + 2 ester (2) + another double bond (1) =6. Doesn't match. So perhaps another ring or a triple bond? Less likely.

Option D: C11H12O2
DoU = (2*11 +2 -12)/2= (24-12)/2=6. Benzene (3) + 2 ester (2) + another DoU (maybe a double bond) =5. No, 3+2=5. So 6 DoU would require another.

Wait, perhaps the substituent has a double bond. So, in the substituent, there's a double bond, which adds another DoU.

So, if the substituent has a double bond, that would account for an additional DoU.

So, for option A: DoU 5. Benzene (3), two ester groups (2) =5. So, that works.

Option B: DoU 6. Benzene (3) + two esters (2) + another DoU (like a double bond) =6. That could work.

Option D: DoU 6. So, benzene (3) + two esters (2) + another DoU (like a double bond) =6. So, that could also work.

But wait, the NMR shows two vinyl Hs. So, there must be a double bond elsewhere, which would contribute to DoU.

So, the substituent must have a double bond, which would add a DoU.

Let me think: the substituent is an ester with a vinyl group, so O-CO-R, where R has a double bond.

So, for example, R could be CH2-CH2-CH2 (no, that's single bonds), but if R is CH2-CH=CH2, that adds a DoU.

So, substituent: O-CO-CH2-CH=CH2.

So, the formula of the substituent is O-CO-CH2-CH=CH2.

The benzene ring has two substituents: O-CO-CH2-CH=CH2 and another group. Wait, but the problem says it's di-substituted. So, perhaps the substituent is only one group. Wait, no, di-substituted benzene has two substituents.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the molecular formula.

If the substituent is O-CO-CH2-CH=CH2, then the substituent has the formula C4H6O2 (since O-CO- is O2, and the R group is C3H5). So, benzene (C6H5) + substituent (C4H6O2) would give a formula of C10H11O2. But the options start at C11.

Hmm, perhaps another substituent. Wait, but the problem states it's di-substituted, so two substituents.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are both ester groups. For example, two O-CO-R groups. But that would require more carbons.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is O-CO-CH2-C(CH3)2. So, substituent formula is O-CO-CH2-C(CH3)2.

Wait, that would be O-CO-C(CH2CH3)2? No, wrong. Let me compute the carbons.

O-CO-CH2-C(CH3)2: that's O-CO-CH2-C(CH3)2. So, the substituent is C4H9O2 (since O-CO is O2, and the R group is C3H7). So, benzene (C6H5) + substituent (C4H9O2) gives C10H14O2. But the options don't have this.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is O-CO-CH(CH2CH3)2. That would be O-CO-CH(CH2CH3)2. The R group is CH(CH2CH3)2, which is C5H11. So, substituent is C6H12O2. Benzene (C6H5) + substituent (C6H12O2) gives C12H17O2, which isn't an option.

Hmm, this is getting tricky. Let me think about the NMR data again.

The –CH3 groups: two signals. So, two different –CH3 groups.

The vinyl Hs: two signals, one a doublet and one a doublet of quartets.

So, perhaps the substituent has a structure like CH2=CH-O-CO- attached to benzene. So, substituent is O-CO-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 (but that's a propyl group, no double bond). Wait, I'm getting stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a group like O-CO-CH2-CH=CH2. So, substituent is O-CO-CH2-CH=CH2.

In this case, the substituent's structure would be O-CO-CH2-CH=CH2.

So, the substituent's R group is CH2-CH=CH2, which has a double bond. The vinyl Hs would be on the CH=CH2 part.

In the NMR, the CH2 next to the carbonyl would have two Hs, perhaps as a quartet due to coupling with the double bond. The CH=CH2 would have two Hs, perhaps as a doublet.

Wait, but the NMR shows two vinyl H signals: one doublet and one doublet of quartets. So, perhaps the CH2 group adjacent to the double bond has two Hs that are split into a quartet (from coupling with the double bond's Hs), and the CH2=CH2 has two Hs (each as a doublet). Wait, the CH2=CH2 would have two Hs which are each coupled to each other, making a doublet. And the CH2 next to the carbonyl would have two Hs, which are coupled to the CH=CH2 Hs, leading to a quartet.

So, in the NMR, the CH2-CH=CH2 group would have the CH2 (next to carbonyl) as a quartet and the CH=CH2 as a doublet.

So, that fits with the NMR description: two vinyl H signals, one doublet and one doublet of quartets.

Now, the substituent would be O-CO-CH2-CH=CH2.

The formula of the substituent would be O-CO-CH2-CH=CH2: that's O2, CO, and the R group is C3H5. So, substituent is C4H7O2.

Benzene is C6H5. So, the total formula would be C6H5-O-CO-CH2-CH=CH2.

Wait, but benzene with two substituents would have two O-CO-CH2-CH=CH2 groups? No, because that would require two substituents, each being O-CO-CH2-CH=CH2.

Wait, no, the compound is di-substituted. So, it has two substituents on the benzene. But if each substituent is O-CO-CH2-CH=CH2, then the formula would be C6H5-(O-CO-CH2-CH=CH2)2.

But that would be a very large molecule. Let me compute the formula:

Each substituent is O-CO-CH2-CH=CH2: which is C4H7O2. Two substituents would add 2*(C4H7O2) = C8H14O4. Benzene is C6H6. So, total formula is C6H6 + C8H14O4 = C14H20O4. But the options are C11 to C12, so this can't be right.

Hmm, perhaps only one substituent has the vinyl group. But wait, the compound is di-substituted, so two substituents. So, perhaps one substituent is an ester with a vinyl group, and the other substituent is a methyl group. But that would give –CH3 signals. Let me compute.

So:

Benzene (C6H5) with two substituents: one is O-CO-CH2-CH=CH2 (C4H7O2), and the other is –CH3.

So, substituents: C4H7O2 and C1H3.

So, the formula is C6H5 + C4H7O2 + C1H3 = C11H15O2.

But looking at the options:

Option A: C11H14O2

Option D: C11H12O2.

Hmm, not matching exactly. Also, molecular formula would be C11H15O2, which is not an option.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is O-CO-CH(CH3)2. Let me think.

O-CO-CH(CH3)2: substituent is C4H8O2.

Benzene (C6H5) + substituent (C4H8O2) = C10H13O2. Not matching the options.

Alternatively, substituent is O-CO-C(CH3)3 (t-butyl ester). So substituent is C5H9O2.

Benzene (C6H5) + substituent (C5H9O2) = C11H14O2. Which is option A.

So, the formula would be C11H14O2. Let's check the NMR.

The substituent would be O-CO-C(CH3)3.

So, the structure is benzene-O-CO-C(CH3)3.

The substituent has two –CH3 groups: the three on the t-butyl group. Wait, but the NMR shows two –CH3 signals. So, three –CH3 groups would likely give one signal (if equivalent), but the NMR shows two.

Hmm, that's a problem. So maybe the substituent is not t-butyl.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is O-CO-CH(CH3)2. So, substituent is C4H8O2.

So, benzene (C6H5) + substituent (C4H8O2) = C10H13O2. Not matching any option.

Wait, another approach: the NMR shows two –CH3 groups. So, perhaps the substituent is a group with two different –CH3 groups.

For example, the substituent could be O-CO-CH(CH3)2-CH3. Wait, but that would have a –CH2 group. Which is not allowed.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a group like O-CO-CH2-C(CH3)2. So, substituent is O-CO-CH2-C(CH3)2.

So, substituent has:

- O-CO-CH2- (which is a CH2 group, but the NMR says no –CH2 signals.)

So, that's a problem. So, perhaps the substituent is O-CO-C(CH3)2-CH3. Wait, that would be O-CO-C(CH3)2CH3, which is O-CO-C(CH3)3 (t-butyl ester), which brings us back to the earlier problem.

Hmm. Perhaps another approach. Let's think about the molecular formula.

Given the options, the correct formula must have 11 or 12 carbons, with the appropriate number of H and O.

The substituent is an ester, so the formula must include O2 from the ester group.

Assume the substituent is a methyl ester (O-CO-CH3). Then, the substituent is O-CO-CH3, which is C3H6O2 (since O-CO is O2, and the R is CH3, which is C1H3).

Benzene is C6H5. So, the molecule would be C6H5-O-CO-CH3, which is C8H8O2. But the options have higher molecular weights. So, perhaps the substituent is larger.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propyl ester, but that would have CH2 groups, which are not allowed because the NMR doesn't show any –CH2 signals.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a phenyl ester. Then, the substituent would be O-CO-C6H5. But that would add a benzene ring, making the compound biphenyl, which is likely. But then, the formula would be C12H10O2. Which is option C (C12H12O2) if the H count is higher. Hmm, no.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a methyl group and an ester group.

Wait, the substituents are O-CO-CH3 and –CH3.

So, formula would be C6H5-O-CO-CH3 and C6H5-CH3.

Wait, no. For di-substituted benzene, two substituents on the same ring. So each substituent would contribute.

So, substituent 1: O-CO-CH3 (C3H6O2) and substituent 2: –CH3 (C1H3).

So, the formula is C6H5-O-CO-CH3 + C6H5-CH3. Wait, no, that would be two benzene rings, which is not correct.

Wait, perhaps it's a single benzene ring with two substituents: O-CO-CH3 and –CH3. So, the formula would be C6H5-O-CO-CH3 and a –CH3 group.

So, the benzene is C6H5. Adding two substituents: O-CO-CH3 (which is C3H6O2) and –CH3 (C1H3). So, the total formula would be C6 + 3 +1 = C10; H: 5 (from benzene) + (6 from ester) +3 =14? Wait, benzene is C6H5 (5 H). Adding O-CO-CH3: which would add 3 H (from CH3). The –CH3 substituent adds another 3 H. So, 5 +3 +3=11 H. Plus any H from the substituent's structure.

Wait, this is getting too vague. Let me approach it differently.

The correct answer must have no –CH2 groups in the structure. So, substituents must be groups without any –CH2–. So, substituents could be –O–CO–R where R has no CH2.

For example, R could be a methyl group (CH3), which doesn't have CH2.

So, substituent is O-CO-CH3. So, the structure would be benzene with two substituents: O-CO-CH3 and another group.

Wait, but the NMR shows two –CH3 signals, so perhaps the substituents are O-CO-CH3 and another –CH3 group.

So, the structure would be benzene-O-CO-CH3 and benzene-CH3.

So, the formula would be C6H5-O-CO-CH3 + C6H5-CH3. Wait, but that would imply two benzene rings, which is unlikely. Alternatively, the substituents are on the same benzene ring.

So, substituent 1: O-CO-CH3 (C3H6O2), substituent 2: –CH3 (C1H3).

So, the formula is C6 + 3 +1 = C10 for carbons? No, C6 + (3 from ester) + (1 from methyl) = C10? Wait, no. The ester group is O-CO-CH3, which has 3 carbons (O, C, O, and CH3: but wait, O-CO-CH3 is O-C(=O)-O-CH3? No, wait, no. Wait, esters are R-O-CO-R'. So, for example, methyl benzoate is C6H5COOCH3. So, the substituent is O-CO-CH3, which is COOCH3. So, the substituent is –O-CO-CH3, which has 2 oxygen atoms and 2 carbons (the COOCH3 group has 3 carbons: the O-CO-O-CH3).

Wait, no. The substituent is –O-CO-CH3. So, that's 3 carbons in the substituent: O, C, O, and CH3. Wait, no. O-CO-CH3 is O-C(=O)-O-CH3? No, esters are R-O-CO-R'. So, for methyl ester, substituent is O-CO-CH3. So, the substituent group is O-CO-CH3, which is three carbons (the COOCH3 group has three carbons: the two from the carbonyl and the methyl).

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the substituent structure wrong. Let's clarify:

An ester group is R-O-CO-R'. So, the substituent is O-CO-R', where R' is an alkyl or aryl group.

If R' is methyl (CH3), then the substituent is O-CO-CH3, which is three carbons (the COO group has two, plus the methyl has one).

So, substituent: O-CO-CH3 (3 carbons).

So, the benzene ring has two such substituents: O-CO-CH3 and another substituent.

Wait, but the NMR shows two –CH3 groups, so perhaps the other substituent is a –CH3 group.

So, substituent 1: O-CO-CH3 (3 carbons), substituent 2: –CH3 (1 carbon).

So, total carbons: 6 (benzene) +3 (ester) +1 (methyl) = 10 carbons. But the options start at C11. So, this can't be right.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is O-CO-C(CH3)2, which is a propionyl group.

Wait, O-CO-C(CH3)2 has 4 carbons (the O-CO is two, and the C(CH3)2 is two more). So substituent is 4 carbons.

So, benzene (6) + substituent (4) = 10 carbons. But the options are C11 and C12. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is O-CO-CH2-C(CH3)2. But that would introduce a –CH2– group, which is not allowed.

Hmm. I think I'm stuck. Let me try to find a structure that matches all the data.

The structure must have:

- A benzene ring with two substituents.

- An ester group (from IR).

- Two –CH3 groups (from NMR).

- Two types of vinyl Hs: one a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets.

- No –CH2 groups in the structure.

So, the substituents must include an ester group and a group with a –CH3 and a double bond.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propenoate ester, like O-CO-CH2-CH=CH2.

So, substituent is O-CO-CH2-CH=CH2.

This substituent has a double bond (CH=CH2) and a –CH3 group (the CH2-CH=CH2 part ends with a CH2–, but wait, that's CH2. So, the substituent would have a CH2 group, which isn't allowed.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is O-CO-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2, but that brings CH2 groups.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is O-CO-CH2-C≡C-CH3. But that's an alkyne, which would have different NMR signals. I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a cyclopropane ring attached, but that complicates things.

Wait, another possibility: the substituent is an allyl ester, but without any –CH2 groups.

Wait, O-CO-CH2-CH=CH2 would have a –CH2– group, which is not allowed. So, perhaps the substituent is O-CO-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, but that's a propyl ester, which introduces –CH2– groups. Not allowed.

Alternatively, the substituent is O-CO-CH3 (methyl ester) and another substituent is an allyl group (–CH2-CH=CH2), but that brings –CH2– groups.

Wait, this is really challenging. Maybe I should look at the options and see which one fits.

Looking at the options:

- Option D: C11H12O2. DoU =6. Benzene (3) + two esters (2) + another DoU (maybe a double bond) =6. Fits.

- Option A: C11H14O2. DoU=5. Benzene (3) + two esters (2) =5. So, no double bond elsewhere.

But the NMR requires a double bond (vinyl Hs), so the substituent must have a double bond, increasing the DoU.

So, for option D, which has DoU=6, the structure must have one more DoU beyond benzene and two esters. So, a double bond in the substituent.

So, substituent must have a double bond, which would account for the vinyl Hs.

So, the substituent is an ester with a double bond.

So, substituent: O-CO-R, where R has a double bond.

But R can't have any –CH2– groups. So, R must be like CH=CH2, but that brings a –CH2– group.

Wait, substituent could be O-CO-CH2-CH=CH2. Then, R is CH2-CH=CH2.

But that has a –CH2– group, which is not allowed.

Hmm. Alternatively, R could be CH=CH-CH3. So, substituent is O-CO-CH=CH-CH3. But that has –CH2– groups in the substituent.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is O-CO-C=CH2-CH3. No, that's not correct.

Wait, I think I'm going in circles. Let me try to think of a possible structure.

The substituent is O-CO-CH2-CH=CH2. But that brings a CH2 group, which is not allowed.

Alternatively, substituent is O-CO-CH2-C≡C-CH3. But that would be an alkyne, and the NMR would show different signals.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a benzyl group with a double bond. But that's too vague.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl ester, like O-CO-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, that would have CH2 groups.

I think I'm stuck and need to make an educated guess based on the options and the data.

The NMR indicates two –CH3 groups and the IR shows an ester. The structure must have two substituents on the benzene, one being an ester group and the other something else.

If the ester group is O-CO-CH2-CH=CH2, but that brings CH2 groups which are not allowed. So, perhaps the substituent is O-CO-CH(CH3)2. But that would have one –CH3 group.

Wait, but the NMR shows two –CH3 signals. So, perhaps the substituent has two different –CH3 groups.

Another possibility: the substituent is O-CO-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. But that introduces a –CH2– group, which is not allowed.

Alternatively, substituent is O-CO-CH(CH2CH3)2. But again, CH2 groups are present.

Hmm. Maybe it's better to look for the option that fits the data.

The NMR shows no –CH2 groups. So, the structure can't have any CH2 groups.

So, substituents must be such that they don't have any CH2.

So, possible substituents are:

- O-CO-CH3 (methyl ester, no CH2).

- O-CO-C(CH3)3 (t-butyl ester, no CH2).

So, if the substituent is O-CO-C(CH3)3, then each substituent would contribute three –CH3 groups. But the NMR shows two –CH3 signals, so perhaps the substituent is O-CO-C(CH3)2CH2 something, but that brings CH2.

Alternatively, if the substituent is O-CO-CH(CH3)2, which is an isopropyl ester. Then, the substituent's structure is O-CO-CH(CH3)2.

In this case, the substituent has a –CH(CH3)2 group. The –CH3 groups are attached to the same carbon, so they would be equivalent. So, the NMR would show one –CH3 signal, not two.

But the NMR shows two –CH3 signals. So, perhaps the substituent is O-CO-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. But that introduces a –CH2– group, which is not allowed.

Hmm. Another thought: perhaps the substituent is a methyl group and the other substituent is an ester without any CH2.

So, substituents are O-CO-CH3 and –CH3.

So, the molecule would be benzene with two substituents: O-CO-CH3 and –CH3.

In this case, the –CH3 from the ester (O-CO-CH3) would be a singlet, and the –CH3 from the ring substituent would be another singlet. So, two –CH3 signals, each a singlet.

The aromatic Hs would be two signals, each 2 H, as the substituents are para.

The vinyl Hs? Wait, the substituent O-CO-CH3 doesn't have any vinyl Hs. So, where would the vinyl Hs come from?

Ah, perhaps I missed that. The ester group itself doesn't have vinyl Hs, but the other substituent might.

Wait, the other substituent is –CH3, which doesn't have vinyl Hs. So, this structure wouldn't account for the vinyl Hs in the NMR. So, this can't be correct.

Hmm. I'm really stuck. Let me think again.

The substituent must have a double bond (to account for the vinyl Hs) and must not have any CH2 groups.

So, substituent structure: O-CO-CH2-CH=CH2 is not allowed because of CH2.

Wait, substituent O-CO-CH=CH2. So, substituent is O-CO-CH=CH2.

But that substituent would have a CH=CH2 group. So, the substituent is O-CO-CH=CH2.

The formula of the substituent is O-CO-CH=CH2, which is C4H6O2.

Benzene is C6H5. So, the molecule would be C6H5-O-CO-CH=CH2.

But it's di-substituted, so there are two substituents. So, perhaps two such substituents.

So, the molecule would be C6H5-(O-CO-CH=CH2)2.

But that would be C6H5-O-CO-CH=CH2-O-CO-CH=CH2.

Wait, that's a dimer and likely not correct.

Alternatively, the substituents are O-CO-CH=CH2 and another group without CH2.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is O-CO-CH=CH2 and another substituent is –CH3.

So, the formula would be C6H5-O-CO-CH=CH2 + C6H5-CH3.

But that brings two benzene rings, which is unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is O-CO-CH=CH2 and the other substituent is another ester.

Wait, this is getting too complicated. I need to proceed to the conclusion.

Based on the IR (ester group), NMR (two –CH3, no –CH2, two aromatic signals, two vinyl signals), and the molecular formula options, the correct formula is likely C11H14O2 (Option A) or C12H14O2 (Option B).

If the substituent is O-CO-C(CH3)3 (t-butyl ester), the formula would be C11H14O2 (since benzene is 6 carbons, substituent is 5 carbons: O-CO-C(CH3)3 is 5 carbons (COO and three CH3)).

Wait, O-CO-C(CH3)3 has 4 carbons: COO (two) and C(CH3)3 (two, including the C). So, substituent is 4 carbons.

Benzene (6) + substituent (4) =10 carbons. But options are C11 and C12.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is O-CO-CH(CH2CH3)2, but that brings CH2 groups.

I think I need to make a choice. The correct answer is likely option B) C12H14O2.

Wait, why? Because if the substituent is an ester with a vinyl group, the formula would have more carbons.

Alternatively, the correct answer is D) C11H12O2.

Wait, I'm not confident. But based on the DoU and the substituent structure, I think the correct answer is option B) C12H14O2.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves identifying the molecular formula of a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound based on spectroscopic data. The compound shows an ester group in the IR spectrum, two aromatic proton signals in the NMR, two vinyl proton signals (one doublet and one doublet of quartets), and two distinct methyl signals, with no signals corresponding to CH₂ groups. The options provided are C₁₁H₁₂O₂, C₁₁H₁₄O₂, C₁₂H₁₂O₂, and C₁₂H₁₄O₂.

### Key Analysis:
1. **IR Spectrum**: The presence of an ester group indicates the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) in the structure.

2. **NMR Spectrum**:
   - **Aromatic Protons**: Two signals suggest a di-substituted benzene ring with two distinct environments for the aromatic protons, likely due to para substitution.
   - **Vinyl Protons**: Two signals (one doublet and one doublet of quartets) indicate the presence of a double bond in the substituent, with two distinct sets of vinyl protons.
   - **Methyl Groups**: Two signals indicate two distinct methyl groups in the structure.
   - **No CH₂ Signals**: The absence of CH₂ signals implies that the substituents do not contain any CH₂ groups.

3. **Molecular Formula Options**:
   - **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**: Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU) = 6. This would require a benzene ring (3 DoU), two ester groups (2 DoU), and one additional double bond or ring.
   - **C₁₁H₁₄O₂**: DoU = 5. This accounts for a benzene ring (3 DoU) and two ester groups (2 DoU), with no additional unsaturation.
   - **C₁₂H₁₂O₂**: DoU = 7. This would require a benzene ring (3 DoU), two ester groups (2 DoU), and an additional two double bonds or rings, which is less likely.
   - **C₁₂H₁₄O₂**: DoU = 6. This accounts for a benzene ring (3 DoU), two ester groups (2 DoU), and one additional double bond or ring.

4. **Structure Considerations**:
   - The presence of vinyl protons in the NMR suggests a double bond in one of the substituents.
   - The absence of CH₂ signals implies that the substituents must avoid CH₂ groups.
   - A plausible structure is a benzene ring with two substituents: one being an ester group (e.g., O-CO-R) and the other containing a double bond (e.g., an allyl or vinyl group).

5. **Final Selection**:
   - **C₁₁H₁₄O₂** (Option A) has DoU = 5, which matches the benzene ring (3 DoU) and two ester groups (2 DoU) without any additional unsaturation. This does not account for the observed vinyl protons.
   - **C₁₂H₁₄O₂** (Option B) has DoU = 6, which matches the benzene ring (3 DoU), two ester groups (2 DoU), and one additional double bond, consistent with the vinyl protons observed in the NMR.
   - **C₁₂H₁₂O₂** (Option C) has DoU = 7, which is inconsistent with the data.
   - **C₁₁H₁₂O₂** (Option D) has DoU = 6, but it would require an additional unsaturation beyond the benzene ring and ester groups, which is less likely.

Based on the spectroscopic data and molecular formula analysis, the most consistent option is **C₁₂H₁₄O₂**.

Answer: B
