Okay, so I have this physics problem here about electric potential energy in an isolated system. Hmm, let me try to figure it out. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll take it step by step.

The problem says there are 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. Oh wait, e is the elementary charge, right? So each charge is 2 times that. And their mass is negligible, so I don't have to worry about kinetic energy or anything like that. The system is isolated, so no external fields are interacting, I suppose.

12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. So, the setup is that one charge is at the center, and the other 12 are all located on a sphere of radius 2 meters around it. But since they're constrained, I guess they don't move around each other, they're fixed at that distance.

The question is asking for the minimum energy of the system, correct to three decimals. The options are given in different exponents, so I need to calculate it properly.

Wait, I remember that the electric potential energy of a system of point charges is the work required to assemble them from infinity. Also, for multiple charges, you have to consider each pair.

So, the formula for the potential energy between two point charges is U = k * (q1 * q2) / r, where k is Coulomb's constant, approximately 8.988×10^9 N·m²/C².

But since we're dealing with a system of multiple charges, the total potential energy is the sum of the potential energies of each pair. But wait, when you have n charges, the number of unique pairs is n*(n-1)/2. But here, since there are 13 charges, but 12 are at the same radius from the 13th.

Wait, but in this problem, the 13th charge is fixed at point P, and the other 12 are each at 2m from P. So each of the 12 charges is at 2m from the central charge, but what about the distance between the 12 surrounding charges?

Are they all at the same point? No, because they are at 2m from P, but their mutual distances could vary. But wait, the problem says they're constrained to stay at 2m from P, but nothing about their mutual distances. So perhaps the minimal energy would come when all the 12 charges are as close as possible to each other, but given that their positions are fixed at 2m from P, maybe that configuration is fixed too? Or perhaps the minimal energy occurs when they're arranged in some way that minimizes the potential energy between them.

Wait, but wait a second. The problem says that each of the 12 is at 2m from P. So each of them is at a distance of 2m from the central charge (the 13th). But what about the distance between any two of the 12 charges? They could be positioned anywhere on the surface of a sphere of radius 2m, so their mutual distances could vary. But in terms of potential energy, the configuration that minimizes the potential energy would be the one where the charges are as close as possible to each other because like charges repel. Wait no, if the charges are all positive, which they are (each is 2e), then putting them as close as possible would increase the repulsion, which would require more work to bring them together, so higher potential energy. Wait, but wait, no, the potential energy between two positive charges is positive because you have to do work against their repulsion to bring them together. So if they are close, the potential energy is higher (more positive). So to minimize the potential energy, we would arrange the charges as far apart as possible.

Ah, but wait, the problem is about the minimum energy of the system. So perhaps the minimal potential energy is achieved when the 12 charges are arranged in such a way that their mutual potential energy is minimized. So how?

Wait, perhaps the 12 charges are equally spaced on the surface of a sphere, forming a regular dodecahedron or something. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe in a configuration where each of the 12 is as far as possible from each other, but since their positions are fixed on a sphere, perhaps it's a symmetric arrangement.

Wait, but maybe I can model the potential energy as the sum of two parts: the potential energy between the central charge and all the surrounding ones, plus the potential energy between all the surrounding charges themselves.

So let's break it down.

First, the central charge is fixed at P. Each of the 12 surrounding charges is at a distance r = 2m from P. So each of these 12 charges will have a potential energy with the central charge.

Each charge is 2e, so the potential energy between the central charge (2e) and any surrounding charge (2e) is:

U = k * (2e) * (2e) / (2) = k * (4e²) / 2 = 2 k e².

Since there are 12 such charges, the total potential energy from the central charge and the 12 surrounding is 12 * 2 k e² = 24 k e².

Wait, no. Wait, no, each surrounding charge contributes a U between itself and the central charge. So for each of the 12 charges, you have U_i = k*(2e)(2e)/(2). Since all 12 are identical, it's 12 * U_i = 12 * (2 k e²) = 24 k e².

Now, the other part is the potential energy between the 12 surrounding charges themselves. Since each of them is 2e, the potential energy between any two of them depends on the distance between them. But wait, the problem says that the 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2 m from point P. So their positions are fixed on a sphere of radius 2m around P. But their mutual distances can vary.

Wait, this complicates things because the potential between each pair of the 12 charges depends on their separation. So to find the minimum energy, I need to find the configuration of the 12 charges on the sphere that minimizes the total potential energy between them.

Hmm, but how? That could be more complicated than I thought. Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that all the 12 charges are at the same point, but that can't be right because their mutual distance would be zero, which would make the potential energy between them infinite, which isn't possible. Or perhaps the problem is simplified by assuming that the mutual distances between the 12 charges are also 2 meters, but that's not correct because in a sphere, the distance between two points on the surface isn't necessarily equal to the radius unless they are the same point.

Wait, wait, maybe the problem is intended to be considered as each of the 12 charges being at a distance of exactly 2m from the central charge, but ignores the mutual distances between the 12 charges. So perhaps, for the sake of the problem, the potential energy between the 12 charges is not considered, or perhaps it's considered that the 12 charges are so far apart that their mutual distances are much larger than 2m, but that's not the case here.

Wait, but the problem states it's an isolated system, so all interactions must be considered. So the total potential energy is the sum of the energy between the central charge and all 12, plus the energy between all pairs among the 12.

But without knowing the distances between the 12, how can I compute this? Maybe the problem is considering only the energy between the central charge and the surrounding ones, and perhaps the potential energy between the 12 is zero or negligible? Or perhaps, for simplicity, the problem assumes that the 12 charges are so close together that the potential energy between them is negligible, but I don't think that's the case.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me read the problem again: "12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 m from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P." So each of the 12 is 2 m from P. The 13th is at P.

So the problem might be considering that the 12 charges are all at 2m from P, but their mutual distances are at their maximum possible on the sphere. Wait, no, because arranging them as far apart as possible would minimize the repulsion between them, thus minimizing the potential energy. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the energy between each of the 12 and the central charge, and neglecting the mutual interactions between the 12. But that's a big assumption.

Wait, but the wording says "the minimum energy of this system." So perhaps the minimal energy is when the system's potential energy is as low as possible, which would require the charges to be as far apart as possible from each other. But without knowing their exact arrangement, perhaps the problem is only considering the energy due to the central charge and the 12 surrounding ones, and ignores the potential between the 12.

Alternatively, perhaps the 12 charges are arranged in a way that they're all very close to each other, but that would increase the potential energy due to their mutual repulsion, which would make the system's energy higher, not lower. So that's not the case.

Wait, I'm a bit stuck here. Let me think. The problem is asking for the minimum energy, so perhaps it's the minimum possible potential energy. The potential energy of the system is the sum of all the pairwise potentials. So to minimize the total potential energy, we need to arrange the system such that each pair contributes the least possible potential energy.

But each pair's potential energy is positive because like charges repel (all charges are 2e, same sign), so the potential energy is positive, meaning that the system is repelling, and the energy is positive. So to minimize the system's energy, we need to arrange the charges such that the potential energy is as small as possible. Since all the terms are positive, the minimal sum would be when each pairwise potential energy is as small as possible.

So for each pair, the potential energy U = k*(2e)*(2e)/d, where d is the distance between them. So to minimize U, we need to maximize d. Because U is inversely proportional to d. So the maximum possible d would give the minimum U for each pair.

So for the pair between the central charge and each of the 12, d is fixed at 2m. So that's fixed, so each of those terms contributes 2 k e² as before.

Now, for the pairs among the 12 charges, each pair's distance d can be as large as possible. On a sphere of radius r=2m, the maximum possible distance between two points is the diameter, which is 4m. So if each pair of the 12 charges is as far apart as possible (4m), then each pair contributes U = k*(2e)*(2e)/(4m) = k*(4e²)/(4) = k e².

But wait, can all pairs of the 12 charges be at a distance of 4m from each other? That's not possible because in a sphere, you can't have all points be diametrically opposite to each other. For example, with 12 points on a sphere, it's impossible for every pair to be 4m apart. So perhaps in reality, the maximum possible minimal distance is the edge length of a regular icosahedron or something.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is assuming that all the 12 charges are arranged in such a way that each is at a distance of 2 m from P, but their mutual distances are also 2 m. But that would require them all to be on the same point, which they can't be because they are separate particles.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is intended to ignore the potential energy between the 12 charges, considering only the potential energy between each and the central charge. Let me see. If that's the case, then the total potential energy is just the sum of the central charge interactions, which would be 12 * (k*(2e)^2 / 2m).

Wait, let's compute that.

Each surrounding charge has a potential energy with the central charge of U = k*(2e)*(2e) / (2) = k*(4e²) / 2 = 2 k e².

So 12 of these would sum to 12 * 2 k e² = 24 k e².

But wait, the units here would be in terms of energy, but let's compute the actual value.

First, let me recall the constants:

e = elementary charge = 1.602176634×10^-19 coulombs.

k = Coulomb's constant = 8.988×10^9 N·m²/C².

So let's compute 24 k e².

Compute e²: (1.602e-19 C)^2 = (approx) 2.566e-38 C².

Then 24 * k * e² = 24 * 8.988e9 * 2.566e-38.

Let's compute that step by step.

First, 8.988e9 * 2.566e-38 = ?

8.988e9 is 8.988 * 1e9. 2.566e-38 is 2.566 * 1e-38.

Multiplying them: 8.988 * 2.566 ≈ let's see: 8.988 * 2 = 17.976, 8.988 * 0.566 ≈ ~5.087. So total is about 17.976 +5.087 ≈ 23.063. So 23.063 * 1e(9-38) = 23.063e-29.

Now multiply by 24: 23.063e-29 * 24 = approx 553.512e-29.

Wait, 23.063 *24 = let me compute exactly: 20 *24=480, 3.063*24=73.512. So 480+73.512=553.512.

So 553.512e-29 J. Which is 5.53512e-27 J.

Wait, but that's only considering the central charge and the 12 surrounding. But then, the mutual potential energy between the 12 charges is zero in this assumption? But that can't be right because the problem says it's an isolated system; all interactions must be considered.

Wait, perhaps the question is only considering the potential energy of the system as due to the central charge and the 12, but not the mutual interactions between the 12. But that seems unlikely because the problem asks for the minimum energy, which would require considering all interactions.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to assume that the 12 charges are so far apart from each other that their mutual potential energy is negligible. But that's not the case here since they're all at 2 meters from P, so the mutual distances would be at least as small as 2m (if some are close to each other).

Wait, but in reality, arranging 12 charges on a sphere, the minimal potential energy configuration would be when each charge is as far away from the others as possible, which would be a symmetric arrangement like a regular icosahedron. But calculating the exact potential energy for that configuration is complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the interactions between the central charge and the 12, and not among the 12 themselves. Otherwise, without knowing the specific arrangement, the problem can't be solved numerically.

Wait, looking at the answer options, option B is 2.822e-26 J, which is about 28 times larger than the 5.5e-27 J I calculated earlier. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me double-check the calculation.

Compute 24 * k * e².

k = 8.988e9 N·m²/C².

e = 1.602e-19 C.

So e² = (1.602e-19)^2 = 2.566e-38 C².

k * e² = 8.988e9 * 2.566e-38 = let's compute that.

First, 8.988e9 * 2.566e-38 = (8.988 * 2.566) * 1e9 *1e-38 = (23.063) * 1e-29 = 2.3063e-28.

Multiply by 24: 24 * 2.3063e-28 = 55.351e-28 = 5.5351e-27 J.

So that gives 5.5351e-27 J, which is about 5.535e-27 J. Looking at the options, option C is 7.056e-27 J, which is higher. Option B is 2.822e-26, which is about 10 times larger than what I got.

Wait, but that's only considering the central charge and the 12 surrounding. So perhaps I missed a factor here.

Wait another thought: when calculating the potential energy between two charges, each pair is counted once. But when you have multiple charges, you have to be careful about not double-counting or missing a factor.

Wait, no, in the U calculation between the central charge and each of the 12, each surrounding charge is a single particle, so each contributes a U of 2 k e². So 12 * 2 k e² is correct.

Hmm, but maybe I made a mistake in the calculation steps.

Wait, let me compute it again.

k = 8.988e9 N·m²/C².

e = 1.602e-19 C.

Each surrounding charge is at 2 m from P.

So U for each surrounding charge and the central charge is (k)*(2e)(2e)/(2m) = (k * 4e²) / (2) )= 2 k e².

So 12 * 2 k e² = 24 k e².

Compute 24 * 8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2.

First, compute e squared: (1.602e-19)^2 = 2.566e-38 C².

Then 8.988e9 * 2.566e-38 = ?

8.988e9 is 8.988 * 1e9.

Multiply by 2.566e-38: 8.988 *2.566 = approx 23.063. So 23.063e(9-38) = 23.063e-29.

Multiply by 24: 23.063e-29 *24 = 553.512e-29 = 5.53512e-27 J.

So that's 5.535e-27 J. But that doesn't match any of the options except option C, which is 7.056e-27, but wait, that's higher.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait another thought: maybe the potential energy is calculated as the sum of all pairs, including the central charge and each of the 12, and all pairs among the 12.

Ah, that's probably the correct approach. Because the problem says it's an isolated system, so all interactions must be considered.

So the total potential energy is the sum of two parts: the energy between the central charge and each of the 12, plus the energy between each pair of the 12.

Wait, but wait, the problem states that the 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2m from P. So their mutual distances could vary, but perhaps the minimum total potential energy would be when their mutual distances are as large as possible, thus each pair contributes the least possible energy.

But without knowing the exact arrangement, perhaps the problem is intended to ignore the mutual interactions between the 12 charges, as a simplification.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that all 12 charges are at the same point, but that would make their mutual distance zero, which is impossible as it would lead to infinite potential energy.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy between the central charge and the 12, and the mutual potential between the 12 is zero. But that's not physically correct.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me look at the options again.

The options are:

A) 5.645e-26

B) 2.822e-26

C)7.056e-27

D)122.330

Wait, the calculation I did earlier without considering the mutual interactions between the 12 charges gave me about 5.535e-27 J. But that's not one of the options except perhaps none. So perhaps I missed a factor of 2, or perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me recheck the math.

Wait, 8.988e9 * 2.566e-38 = ?

Let me compute 8.988 * 2.566 = ?

Let me compute it more accurately.

8 * 2.566 = 20.528.

0.988 * 2.566 ≈ let's compute 1 * 2.566 = 2.566, subtract 0.012 * 2.566 = ~0.0308. So 2.566 - 0.0308 ≈ 2.535.

So total 20.528 + 2.535 ≈ 23.063.

So 8.988e9 * 2.566e-38 = 23.063e-29.

Multiply by 24: 23.063e-29 * 24 = 23.063 *24 = 553.512e-29 = 5.535e-27 J.

Hmm, but that's not matching any option except perhaps option C is higher. So perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, perhaps the charges are 2e each, and the central charge is 2e as well. So each charge is 2e. So when I compute the potential energy between the central charge and another charge, it's k*(2e)(2e)/(2) = (4e² k)/ 2 = 2 e² k.

So for each of the 12 charges, that's 2 * 8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2.

Wait, no, earlier calculation was correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing a factor of 2, because each pair is considered twice when calculating the potential energy.

Wait no, the potential energy between two charges is computed once for each pair. So perhaps I have to consider each pair only once. Wait, but in the setup, the central charge is fixed, and the other 12 are each interacting with it. So each of those 12 charges contributes a U of (2e)(2e)/(2m) *k. So each is 2 ke², and the sum is 12 * 2 ke² = 24 ke².

So that's the correct way.

But then, where are the other terms coming from? The mutual potential between the 12 charges.

Hmm, perhaps without knowing their arrangement, the problem expects us to ignore that part, but that would be incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the 12 charges are all at 2m apart from each other as well, but that's not possible unless they're all at the same point, which isn't the case.

Wait, perhaps the problem is intended to have the 12 charges arranged in a way that each is at 2m from P and 2m from each other. That would be a regular icosahedron or something, but I'm not sure.

But in that case, the distance between any two of the 12 charges would be 2m. So their mutual potential energy would be U = k*(2e)(2e)/(2m) = (4e² k)/(2m) = 2 e² k/m?

Wait, but m is in meters, and k has units N·m²/C². Let me check the units.

Wait, no, the formula is U = k * q1 q2 / r.

So for two charges each 2e, and distance 2m, U = k*(4e²)/(2) = 2 k e².

So each pair of the 12 contributes 2 ke². How many such pairs are there?

The number of pairs among 12 charges is (12 * 11)/2 = 66 pairs.

So each of those 66 pairs contributes 2 ke².

So the total potential energy from the mutual interactions would be 66 * 2 ke² = 132 ke².

So the total potential energy would be the sum of both parts:

- Energy from central charge and 12 surrounding: 24 ke².

- Energy from mutual interactions between the 12: 132 ke².

Total U = 24 ke² + 132 ke² = 156 ke².

So 156 ke².

Now, compute this value.

k=8.988e9 N m²/C².

e=1.602e-19 C.

So ke² = 8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2.

Compute that:

(1.602e-19)^2 = 2.566e-38.

Then, 8.988e9 * 2.566e-38 = ?

As before, 8.988e9 * 2.566e-38 = 23.063e-29.

So 156 * 23.063e-29 = 156 * 23.063e-29.

Compute 156 * 23.063:

23.063 * 100 = 2306.3

23.063 *50 = 1153.15

23.063 *6=138.378.

Adding them: 2306.3 + 1153.15 = 3459.45 + 138.378 = 3597.828.

So 3597.828e-29 = 3.597828e-26 J.

Wait, that would be 3.598e-26 J. Looking at the options, option B is 2.822e-26, which is a bit lower.

Hmm, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming that each of the 12 charges is at 2m from each other. Because in reality, arranging 12 charges on a sphere of radius 2m, it's impossible for all pairs to be exactly 2m apart. That would require a highly symmetric arrangement which may not be possible, or perhaps it's a regular polygon arrangement.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem doesn't require considering the mutual interactions between the 12 charges, and only considers the energy between them and the central charge. So the correct approach is to only calculate the 24 ke² term.

But earlier, that gave me 5.535e-27 J, which isn't one of the options. But let's look at the options:

Option C is 7.056e-27 J, which is about 1.27 times larger than my calculation.

Wait, but why would there be a discrepancy? Perhaps I made a mistake in the computation steps.

Wait, perhaps when calculating the potential energy between the central charge and each of the 12, I forgot to multiply by the number of pairs correctly.

Wait, no, each of the 12 charges contributes a single U, so 12 * U_i. But perhaps when considering the mutual interactions between the 12, I should have considered that each pair is counted once.

Wait, let me double-check that.

The total potential energy of the system is the sum of the potential energies of each pair.

The pairs are:

- 12 pairs between the central charge and each of the 12 surrounding charges.

- C(12, 2) = 66 pairs among the 12 surrounding charges.

Each of the 12 surrounding charges is at 2m from the central charge, so each pair contributes (2e)(2e)/(2m) * k = 2 k e².

Each of the 66 pairs among the 12 charges would have a distance d which depends on their arrangement. But without knowing d, perhaps the problem is intended to have each of these pairs at 2m apart, which would be incorrect but perhaps simplifies the problem.

But if that's the case, each mutual pair would contribute 2 k e², leading to 66 * 2 k e² = 132 k e².

So total U = 12 * 2 k e² + 66 * 2 k e² = (24 + 132) k e² = 156 k e².

But earlier calculation of 156 * 23.063e-29 gives 3.597e-26 J.

But none of the options match that. The closest option is B) 2.822e-26, which is lower.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the mutual distance between the 12 charges is 2m, but that's not the case because they are on a sphere of radius 2m. The maximum distance between any two points on the sphere is 4m, but the minimum is greater than zero.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the potential energy between the 12 charges assuming they are arranged in a way that each is as far apart as possible. But without knowing the exact arrangement, it's impossible to compute it exactly.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to only consider the energy between the central charge and the 12, and not their mutual interactions. So the correct answer would be 5.535e-27 J, but that's not an option.

Wait, the option C is 7.056e-27, which is about 1.27 times larger than my calculation. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the value of e.

Wait, let me recalculate e^2.

e = 1.602176634e-19 C.

So e squared is (1.602176634e-19)^2.

Let me compute that more accurately.

(1.602176634)^2 = approximately 2.56697 (since 1.602^2 = 2.566).

So 2.56697e-38 C².

So k * e² = 8.988e9 * 2.56697e-38 = ?

8.988e9 = 8.988 * 1e9.

8.988 * 2.56697 ≈ let's compute:

2.56697 * 8 = 20.53576.

2.56697 * 0.988 = let's compute:

0.988 * 2.56697 ≈ 2.56697 * 1 = 2.56697, minus 2.56697 * 0.012=0.03080364.

So 2.56697 - 0.03080364 ≈ 2.536166.

So total 20.53576 + 2.536166 ≈ 23.071926.

So 23.071926e-29.

Multiply by 24: 24 * 23.071926e-29 = 553.7262e-29 = 5.537262e-27 J.

Still about 5.537e-27 J.

Looking at the options again, option C is 7.056e-27, which is higher. So perhaps the problem requires considering mutual interactions, but I'm not seeing it.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that each of the 12 charges is interacting with the central charge, but also that the 12 charges are arranged in a way that their mutual potential is zero, perhaps in a symmetrical arrangement where their contributions cancel out. But that can't be true because all are like charges.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the 12 charges arranged such that their mutual potential energy is zero, which would be a trick, but that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in considering that each of the 12 charges contributes a potential energy of 2 ke² towards the central charge. Let's recheck that.

Each surrounding charge is at 2m from P, charge 2e. Central charge is 2e.

So U = k*(2e)(2e)/(2) = (4 e² k) / 2 = 2 e² k.

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the problem is in coulombs, but perhaps I should use e as 1.6e-19 C.

But even that wouldn't change the order of magnitude.

I'm a bit stuck here. The only option that's close to my calculation (5.5e-27) when considering only the central charge interactions is option C (7.056e-27), but that's about 1.27 times higher.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the factor. Let me think again: the central charge is 2e, and each surrounding charge is 2e.

So U for each surrounding charge is (2e)(2e)/(2m) *k = (4 e²)/(2) * k = 2 e² k.

Wait, yes, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to compute all pairs, including the mutual ones, but assuming that each of the 12 charges is at a distance of 2m from each other. But that would require them all being at the same point, which isn't possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual distance is 4m, the diameter, which would minimize each pair's potential energy.

If each pair of the 12 is at 4m apart, then each mutual pair contributes U = k*(2e)(2e)/(4m) = (4e² k) /4 = e² k.

So each of the 66 mutual pairs contributes e² k.

So the total mutual energy would be 66 * e² k.

Then total U = 24 ke² + 66 ke² = 90 ke².

Compute 90 * 23.071926e-29 = 90 * 23.071926e-29 = 2076.47334e-29 = 2.07647334e-26 J.

That's approximately 2.076e-26 J. Looking at the options, option B is 2.822e-26, which is higher.

Hmm, but perhaps the mutual pairs are arranged with a larger distance than 4m, but that's not possible as the maximum distance on a sphere is the diameter.

Wait, perhaps the mutual distance is 2m as well, but that would cause each mutual pair to contribute 2 ke².

Wait, but earlier calculation when mutual distance is 2m gave me 156 ke², which is 3.597e-26 J, which isn't an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the mutual potential energy be zero, but that's not possible with like charges.

Wait, perhaps I've made a miscalculation in the initial approach. Let me try to compute everything again.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the potential energy is calculated as the sum over all pairs, each contributing (k * q_i q_j)/r_ij.

In this problem, q_i is 2e for all i.

The central charge (let's call it C) is 2e.

The surrounding charges are S1, S2, ..., S12, each 2e.

So the potential energy is:

U = U(C, S1) + U(C, S2) + ... + U(C, S12) + U(S1, S2) + U(S1, S3) + ... + U(S11, S12).

So the first part is 12 * U(C, S_i), each U(C,S_i) is (k * 2e * 2e) / 2m.

So 12 * (4 e² k )/(2m) = 12 * 2 e² k / m.

Wait, wait, 2m is the distance, so 4e² k/(2m) = 2 e² k/m.

Wait, no, let's compute U(C,S_i):

U = k*(2e)(2e)/(2) = (4e² k) / 2 = 2 e² k.

So 12 * 2 e² k = 24 e² k.

Now, for the mutual pairs among the 12, each pair is at some distance r_ij.

But without knowing r_ij, we can't compute U(S_i, S_j) for each i<j.

But perhaps the problem is considering that the mutual potential energy is zero, which would be incorrect, but perhaps it's a trick. Alternatively, the problem might have a typo, and the correct answer isn't among the options.

Alternatively, perhaps I missed a factor of 1/2 somewhere.

Wait, another thought: when calculating the potential energy between two charges, you might have to consider that each pair is counted once, so perhaps I'm already correct in summing each pair once.

But I'm stuck. Given the options, and the fact that my initial calculation (without mutual interactions) gives 5.535e-27 J, which isn't an option, I'm at a loss.

Wait, perhaps I should re-calculate with the correct e value.

e = 1.602176634e-19 C.

So e squared is (1.602176634e-19)^2 = 2.56697 (exactly, 2.56697 x10^-38).

k=8.988e9 N·m²/C².

So 24 * k * e² = 24 * 8.988e9 * 2.56697e-38.

Compute 8.988e9 *2.56697e-38 = ?

8.988e9 = 8.988 *1e9.

Multiply by 2.56697e-38: 8.988 * 2.56697 = ?

Compute 8 * 2.56697 = 20.53576.

0.988 * 2.56697 ≈ 2.536 (as before).

Total ≈ 20.53576 + 2.536 ≈ 23.07176.

So 23.07176e-29.

Multiply by 24: 24 * 23.07176e-29 = 553.7222e-29 = 5.537222e-27 J.

Hmm, the same as before.

None of the options match this. So perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but that's unlikely.

Wait, looking at the options again, option B is 2.822e-26, which is about 5.07 times larger than 5.5e-27.

Wait, 5.5e-27 * 5.07 ≈ 2.8e-26.

So perhaps the problem requires considering the mutual interactions between the 12 charges, and the mutual potential energy is 5 times the initial calculation. But without knowing the exact distances, I can't compute it.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in a calculation step.

Wait, perhaps the problem is in coulombs, but uses e as the elementary charge instead of 2e. No, the problem clearly states each charge is 2e.

Wait, another thought: the potential energy between two point charges is U = (k q1 q2 ) / r.

But all charges are positive, so each pair contributes a positive U.

Wait, perhaps the minimum energy is achieved when the mutual potential energy is as small as possible, which would be when the charges are as far apart as possible.

But without knowing their exact arrangement, perhaps the problem expects us to assume that the 12 charges are arranged such that each is at a distance of 2m from each other, which would give each mutual pair a potential energy of (k * (2e)(2e)) / (2m) = (4 e² k)/(2) = 2 e² k.

But that's the same as the central charge interaction. With 66 such pairs, that would be 66 * 2 e² k = 132 e² k.

So total U = 24 e² k + 132 e² k = 156 e² k.

Which is 156 * 23.07176e-29 = 3597.7e-29 = 3.5977e-26 J.

Still, this doesn't match any option except possibly none.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual distances are 4m, so each mutual pair contributes (k * 4e² )/(4) = e² k.

So 66 * e² k = 66 *23.07176e-29 = 1518.5e-29 = 1.5185e-26 J.

Adding the central charge part: 24 *23.07176e-29=553.7e-29=5.537e-27 J.

Total U = 5.537e-27 + 1.5185e-26 = 20.722e-27 = 2.0722e-26 J.

Still doesn't match any option.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the mutual potential is to be ignored, and the answer is 5.5e-27, but the closest option is C: 7.056e-27.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of 24 * 23.07176e-29.

Wait, 24 * 23.07176e-29 = ?

23.07176e-29 is 2.307176e-28.

So 24 *2.307176e-28 = 55.3722e-28 =5.53722e-27 J.

So yeah, that's correct.

So perhaps the intended answer is option B, but it's unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the problem is in considering that each of the 12 charges is at a distance of 2m from P, but their mutual distances are all 2m as well.

In that case, the mutual pairs would be 66 * (k*(2e)^2)/(2) = 66 * (4e² k)/(2) = 66 * 2 e² k.

So mutual U = 132 e² k.

Central charge U: 12 * 2 e² k =24 e² k.

Total U = 156 e² k = 156 * (8.988e9) * (1.602e-19)^2.

As before, 156 *23.07176e-29 = 3.597e-26 J, which isn't an option.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem only considers the central charge and the 12, and not the mutual pairs. So the correct calculation is 5.535e-27 J, which is not an option.

But the options given are:

A) 5.645e-26

B)2.822e-26

C)7.056e-27

D)122.330

Hmm, option C is 7.056e-27 J, which is about 1.27 times larger than 5.535e-27. So perhaps the correct answer is option C, but I'm not sure why.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of charges. Wait, the problem states 13 charges: 12 at 2m from P, and the 13th at P.

So, the central charge is 2e, and each of the 12 is 2e.

So the number of interactions with the central charge is 12, correct.

But perhaps the mutual interactions are ignored, leading to the answer of 5.535e-27 J, but that's not an option. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the distance is 2m, but in the formula, the distance is in meters, which I have used correctly.

Wait, another thought: maybe the problem uses the formula for potential energy as (k q^2 )/(r), and each charge is 2e, so q^2 is (2e)^2 =4e². So U =k *4e²/(2r), where r is 2m.

Wait, no, that's not correct. The formula is U =k q1 q2 / r. Each q is 2e, so each U is (k *2e *2e)/r =4e² k / r.

But for the central charge, r is 2m, so U =4e² k/(2)=2 e² k per charge. 12 charges, so 24 e² k.

But maybe I should compute it as (k*(2e)^2)/(2), which is the same as 2ke².

Yes, correct.

So again, same calculation.

Hmm.

Given that none of the options match my calculation when mutual interactions are considered, and when only the central interactions are considered, the answer isn't an option, I'm a bit stuck.

Another possibility: perhaps the problem considers the potential energy between the 12 charges as zero, which would be incorrect, but perhaps it's a mistake.

So perhaps the correct answer is option B, 2.822e-26 J, which is approximately 5.07 times my initial calculation.

Wait, 5.07 times 5.5e-27 is 2.8e-26.

Hmm, perhaps I should recheck the calculation of 24 * 23.07176e-29.

Wait, 23.07176e-29 is 2.307176e-28.

Multiply by 24: 24 * 2.307176e-28 = 55.3722e-28 = 5.53722e-27 J.

Wait, perhaps I missed a factor of 5 in the options, but I don't see why.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the 12 charges arranged in a way that each is at a distance of 2m from P, but the mutual distance is 2m as well, leading to each mutual pair contributing 2 ke².

But that would give 66 * 2 ke², which as before, leads to 3.597e-26 J.

But again, not matching any option.

I think I'm stuck. Based on the options provided, and considering only the energy between the central charge and the 12 surrounding charges, the closest option would be option C, 7.056e-27 J, but I'm not sure why it's higher than my calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the exponents.

Wait, let me recheck:

k=8.988e9 N·m²/C².

e=1.602e-19 C.

e²=2.566e-38 C².

k * e² =8.988e9 * 2.566e-38 = 23.07e-29.

Multiply by 24: 24 *23.07e-29 =553.68e-29 =5.5368e-27 J.

So the correct calculation gives 5.5368e-27 J.

Looking at the options, option C is 7.056e-27 J.

Hmm, perhaps the problem uses a different value for k, such as 9e9 N·m²/C². Let's try that.

k=9e9.

Then, k * e² =9e9 *2.566e-38=23.094e-29.

24 *23.094e-29=554.256e-29=5.54256e-27 J.

Still not matching option C.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses e=1.6e-19 C.

e=1.6e-19.

e²=2.56e-38.

k=8.988e9.

k *e²=8.988e9 *2.56e-38=23.03e-29.

24 *23.03e-29=552.72e-29=5.5272e-27 J.

Still not matching.

Hmm.

Given the time I've spent and the options provided, I think the intended answer is option B) 2.822e-26 J, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C, but I'm not seeing why.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that each of the 12 charges contributes a potential energy of (k*(2e)^2)/(2*2), because the distance from the central charge is 2m, but perhaps the mutual distances are 4m, leading to each mutual pair contributing k*(2e)^2/(4m) = (4e² k)/(4)=e² k.

So mutual U=66 * e² k=66 *23.07e-29=1.518e-26 J.

Adding the central charge part: 24 *23.07e-29=5.537e-27 J.

Total U=1.518e-26 +5.537e-27= 2.0717e-26 J.

Still not matching any option.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual potential energy is (12 choose 3) times something, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the potential energy between each charge and the central charge, but not the mutual ones, and the correct answer is 5.535e-27 J, but that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the formula for potential energy as U = (1/2) * k * q^2 / r. But why would that be the case?

Wait, maybe because each pair is counted once, not twice. So for the central charge and the 12, it's 12 * (1/2) * k*(2e)^2/(2m).

Wait, that would be 12 * (k*(4e²)/(2*2m)) )=12*(k*(4e²)/(4m))=12*(k e²/m).

Wait, but that would be 12 * (k e² / 2) =6 k e².

Wait, but then that would be 6 * (8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2 /2).

Wait, compute that:

k e² =8.988e9 * (2.566e-38) =23.07e-29.

Divide by 2:11.535e-29.

Multiply by 6:69.21e-29=6.921e-28 J.

Not matching any option.

Hmm.

At this point, I think I'm stuck and perhaps the correct approach is to select the closest option, which is option C)7.056e-27 J, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps option B is the intended answer, considering mutual interactions, but I'm not sure.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the minimum energy of the system, we calculate the total electric potential energy, which includes contributions from two parts: the potential energy between the central charge and the 12 surrounding charges, and the potential energy between the 12 surrounding charges themselves. The problem specifies that the 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2 m from the central charge, but their mutual distances are not explicitly defined. This introduces some ambiguity in the calculation.

### Key Analysis:

1. **Potential Energy Between the Central Charge and the 12 Surrounding Charges**  
   Each surrounding charge is at a distance of 2 m from the central charge. The potential energy between the central charge and one surrounding charge is:  
   \[
   U = k \cdot \frac{(2e)(2e)}{2} = 2ke^2
   \]  
   Since there are 12 such charges, the total contribution is:  
   \[
   U_{\text{central}} = 12 \cdot 2ke^2 = 24ke^2
   \]  
   Substituting \( k = 8.988 \times 10^9 \, \text{N·m}^2/\text{C}^2 \) and \( e = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C} \):  
   \[
   e^2 = (1.602 \times 10^{-19})^2 = 2.566 \times 10^{-38} \, \text{C}^2
   \]  
   \[
   ke^2 = (8.988 \times 10^9) \cdot (2.566 \times 10^{-38}) = 2.307 \times 10^{-29} \, \text{J}
   \]  
   \[
   U_{\text{central}} = 24 \cdot (2.307 \times 10^{-29}) = 5.537 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J}
   \]

2. **Potential Energy Between the 12 Surrounding Charges**  
   The potential energy between any two surrounding charges depends on their mutual distance. If the charges are arranged symmetrically on a sphere of radius 2 m, the exact configuration of their mutual distances is unclear. However, the problem likely assumes that the potential energy between the 12 charges is either negligible or already accounted for in the given options.  

3. **Comparison with Options**  
   The calculated potential energy from the central charge and the 12 surrounding charges is \( 5.537 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J} \), which does not match any of the provided options. The closest option is **C) \( 7.056 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J} \)**, which is about 1.27 times larger than the calculated value. This discrepancy suggests that the problem may implicitly include additional contributions (e.g., mutual interactions between the 12 charges) that are not explicitly calculated here.

### Conclusion:
Given the ambiguity in the problem and the provided options, the most reasonable choice is **C) \( 7.056 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J} \)**, as it is the closest to the calculated value when considering potential missing contributions.

Answer: C
