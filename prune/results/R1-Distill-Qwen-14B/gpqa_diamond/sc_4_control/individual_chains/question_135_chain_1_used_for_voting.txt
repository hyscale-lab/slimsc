Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a boson. Hmm, let's see what it's asking. The question is about the possible decay channels of a boson X with a mass of 6 GeV. The interaction Lagrangian is given, but I'm not sure if I need to parse that right now.

Wait, the Lagrangian is L = -λ f f-bar ψ_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, the structure looks a bit confusing. Oh wait, maybe it's something like -λ f \bar{ψ}_f (v + X) ψ_f. So, the boson X is interacting with fermions, specifically the fermion field ψ_f. So, X is a boson field, and the interaction term would likely be something that allows X to decay into fermion-antifermion pairs.

Since X is a boson, its decay products would be fermions. So, X can decay into pairs of particles and their antiparticles. The possible decay products depend on the mass of X and the masses of the possible fermions.

The mass of X is 6 GeV. So, any fermion pair that can result from the decay must have a combined mass less than or equal to 6 GeV. Because in particle physics, the rest mass energy must be less than the mass of the parent particle to allow the decay.

First, I should list out the possible fermions and their masses. Let me remember the masses of the quarks and leptons:

- Up and down quarks are the lightest. Their masses are about a few MeV. So, up (u) is around 2-5 MeV, down (d) similar. So, u and d quarks are definitely light enough because 6 GeV is way higher.
- Strange (s) quark is about 100 MeV. Still way below 6 GeV.
- Charm (c) quark is around 1.5 GeV. So a pair of c quarks would be about 3 GeV each, so 3 GeV each, so 3 * 2 = 6 GeV. So, X can decay into c c-bar if the mass is exactly 6 GeV. Wait, but for decay, the rest mass needs to be less than or equal because the parent has some energy. But I think for the sake of allowed decays, as long as the sum is <= 6 GeV, it's allowed. So c c-bar would be allowed since 2m_c ≈ 3 GeV.

What about bottom quarks (b)? Their mass is about 4-5 GeV. So a b quark pair would be 8-10 GeV, which is way above 6 GeV. So X cannot decay into b b-bar.

Top quark is even heavier, around 173 GeV, so definitely not. So, possible quarks are u, d, s, c.

Then, looking at leptons. The charged leptons are e, mu, tau. Their masses are:

- Electron (e): almost 0 mass, so 2m_e is negligible. So e+ e- is definitely allowed.
- Muon (mu): about 0.1 GeV (105.7 MeV). So 2m_mu is ~0.211 GeV, which is way under 6.
- Tau (tau): about 1.78 GeV. So 2m_tau is around 3.56 GeV, which is under 6 GeV.

So tau pairs are allowed.

What about neutrinos? Neutrinos are very light, but they are neutral. But the interaction term given is for charged fermions, I think. Also, neutrinos are usually considered as Dirac or Majorana particles, but in this Lagrangian, the interaction is with ψ_f, which I think are charged fermions because the term is \bar{ψ} ψ, which would make sense for charged. So, perhaps neutrinos are not involved here.

So, possible decay products are:

Quark-antiquark pairs: uū, dđ, sš, cč.

Lepton pairs: e+ e-, mu+ mu-, tau+ tau-.

Wait, but looking at the options, let's see. The options A to D vary in which decay channels they include.

Option A: X → b b-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau+ tau-, e+ e-.

Wait, but earlier I concluded that b b-bar is 8-10 GeV, so X can't decay into that. So option A includes b b-bar, which is impossible. So A is incorrect.

Option B: X → c c-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

So, includes c c-bar. Since X's mass is 6 GeV, 2m_c is about 3 GeV, so yes. Also includes tau, mu, e. So that seems possible.

Option C: X → c c-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, t t-bar, tau, mu, e.

Wait, t is top quark, which is way too heavy. So t t-bar is way beyond 6 GeV, so X can't decay into t t-bar. So option C is incorrect.

Option D: X → b b-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau, mu, e.

Again, b is too heavy, so D is incorrect.

So the correct option should be B.

Wait, but let me double-check. So X can decay into any fermion pair where the sum of the masses is less than or equal to 6 GeV.

- c c-bar: 2 * 1.5 GeV = 3 GeV → allowed.
- tau+ tau-: 2 * 1.78 GeV = 3.56 GeV → allowed.
- mu+ mu-: about 0.2 GeV → allowed.
- e+ e-: negligible → allowed.
- s s-bar: 2 * 100 MeV = 0.2 GeV → allowed.
- d d-bar: 2 * ~5 MeV → allowed.
- u u-bar: same as d d-bar.

So all these are allowed.

But option B includes c c-bar, which is allowed, and the others. So yes, option B is correct.

The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decays of a boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV. The interaction Lagrangian indicates that \( X \) can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs. The allowed decay products depend on the combined mass of the fermion pair being less than or equal to the mass of \( X \), which is 6 GeV.

### Analysis of Possible Decay Channels:
1. **Quark-Antiquark Pairs**:
   - \( u\bar{u} \) and \( d\bar{d} \): The masses of up (\( u \)) and down (\( d \)) quarks are a few MeV, so their pairs are allowed.
   - \( s\bar{s} \): The strange quark (\( s \)) has a mass of about 100 MeV, so \( s\bar{s} \) is allowed.
   - \( c\bar{c} \): The charm quark (\( c \)) has a mass of about 1.5 GeV, so \( c\bar{c} \) is allowed since \( 2m_c = 3 \, \text{GeV} \leq 6 \, \text{GeV} \).
   - \( b\bar{b} \): The bottom quark (\( b \)) has a mass of about 4-5 GeV, so \( b\bar{b} \) is not allowed since \( 2m_b > 6 \, \text{GeV} \).

2. **Lepton Pairs**:
   - \( e^+e^- \): The electron (\( e \)) is effectively massless, so \( e^+e^- \) is allowed.
   - \( \mu^+\mu^- \): The muon (\( \mu \)) has a mass of about 0.1 GeV, so \( \mu^+\mu^- \) is allowed.
   - \( \tau^+\tau^- \): The tau (\( \tau \)) has a mass of about 1.78 GeV, so \( \tau^+\tau^- \) is allowed since \( 2m_\tau = 3.56 \, \text{GeV} \leq 6 \, \text{GeV} \).

3. **Neutrinos**: Neutrinos are neutral and their masses are negligible, but they are not explicitly included in the interaction term, which focuses on charged fermions. Thus, neutrino pairs are not considered.

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A**: Includes \( b\bar{b} \), which is not allowed since \( 2m_b > 6 \, \text{GeV} \). Hence, A is incorrect.
- **Option B**: Includes \( c\bar{c} \), \( s\bar{s} \), \( u\bar{u} \), \( d\bar{d} \), \( \tau^+\tau^- \), \( \mu^+\mu^- \), and \( e^+e^- \), all of which are allowed. Hence, B is correct.
- **Option C**: Includes \( t\bar{t} \), which is not allowed since the top quark (\( t \)) is much heavier than \( X \). Hence, C is incorrect.
- **Option D**: Includes \( b\bar{b} \), which is not allowed. Hence, D is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is **Option B**, as it lists all kinematically allowed decay channels for the boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV.
