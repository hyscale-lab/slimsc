Okay, let's tackle this chemistry problem. Hmm. I'm a bit rusty on my organic chemistry, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

So, the question involves two reactions. Each reaction uses a different reducing agent—LiBH4 and BH3. The products from both are enantiomers of each other, specifically (R) and (S) configurations of 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. I remember that the stereochemistry of the product depends on the starting material and the reagents used.

Wait, LiBH4 is a stronger reducing agent than BH3. Or wait, no—BH3 is usually used in the formation of ketones, like in the reduction of esters or ketals. LiBH4 is a stronger borohydride and can reduce things that BH3 can't, like esters. But in this case, both reagents are being used with different starting materials A and B, leading to different products with opposite configurations.

Wait, the product is a ketone. So the starting materials must have been something that can form a ketone upon reduction. Let me think, what kind of compounds form ketones when reduced? Oh, right, ketals. Because when a ketal is reduced, it gives a ketone. Wait, no, wait: ketals are protecting groups for ketones. So maybe the starting materials are some kind of cyclic ketals or acetals.

Wait, the product is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. Tetrahydropyran is a six-membered ring with five carbons and one oxygen, right? So 2-pyranone would be a cyclic ketone. So the structure is O=C-O in a six-membered ring, with ethyl group at position 4. So the product is a cyclic ketone, specifically a tetrahydropyran-2-one.

So, how do you get that from a reduction? If the starting material is a cyclic ether, perhaps a ketal. Wait, no, wait. Let me think: when you have a ketal, like a cyclic acetal, and you reduce it, you would break the acetal and form something else. Alternatively, maybe the starting material is a ketone, but that doesn't make sense because the product is also a ketone.

Wait, no, perhaps the starting materials are some kind of esters or ketals that, upon reduction, form the ketone. Or wait, maybe the starting materials are epoxides? No, I think that's a stretch. Alternatively, maybe the starting materials are cyclic ketals which, when reduced, open up to form the ketone.

Oh wait, another approach: the product is a cyclic ketone, so perhaps the starting material was a cyclic hemiacetal or something that upon reduction forms the ketone.

Wait, let me backtrack. The product is a ketone, 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. The reactions are reductions, so the starting material must have been a carbonyl group that, upon reduction, becomes a secondary alcohol. No, wait, that's not right. Wait, if you have a ketone and reduce it, you get a secondary alcohol. But in this case, the product is a ketone, so perhaps the starting material is a different carbonyl group, like an ester or a ketal.

Wait, another possibility: the starting materials are cyclic acetals. Acetals are typically used to protect ketones or aldehydes. When you reduce an acetal, you typically get the corresponding diol. But here, the product is a ketone, so that doesn't fit. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are cyclic ketals, which when treated with a reducing agent, break down into a ketone. Wait, maybe the starting material is an acetal that, upon reduction, forms the ketone.

Wait, let me think about the mechanism. When you have a cyclic ketal, like a six-membered ring with an oxygen, and you reduce it, perhaps using BH3 or LiBH4, what happens? I'm a bit confused. I remember that BH3 is used in the hydroboration reaction, but when it's used with something like a ketone, it would add to the carbonyl. Wait, no—if the starting material is a more complex structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are epoxides. But I'm not sure. Let me think about what reagents do what. LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, it can reduce esters to alcohols, for example. BH3 is typically used in the more selective reductions, like in ketone reductions or in hydroboration reactions.

Wait, but in the problem, the products are enantiomers. So the starting materials must have some sort of stereogenic centers that, upon reduction, lead to the opposite configurations.

Wait, maybe the starting materials are epoxides. When you reduce an epoxide, you typically get a diol. But that doesn't fit with the product being a ketone. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the starting materials are some kind of cyclic ethers with ketone groups. Or maybe they are cyclic acetals of ketones. Let me think about cyclic acetals. A cyclic acetal is formed from a diol and a ketone or aldehyde. So, when you reduce a cyclic acetal, you break the acetal and form something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are some kind of esters. For instance, an ester might be reduced to a ketone, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the product is a ketone, so the starting material must have been a group that could be reduced to form that ketone. Maybe the starting materials are epoxides, but that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are cyclic hemiacetals.

Wait, another thought: maybe the starting materials are ketals. So, when you reduce a ketal, you could get a diol. But the product here is a ketone, not a diol. So that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think about the product structure: 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. The substituents are at positions 2 and 4. So the ring is a six-membered ring (like tetrahydropyran), with a ketone at position 2 and an ethyl group at position 4.

So, the product is a cyclic ketone. So, perhaps the starting materials were cyclic hemiacetals that upon reduction gave this ketone.

Wait, no. Maybe the starting materials were epoxides. But that doesn't seem to fit. Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials were cyclic acetals.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are some kind of cyclic esters, like lactones. Wait, but reducing a lactone would give a diol, not a ketone.

Wait, perhaps the starting materials are methyl groups attached to a ring. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, perhaps the starting materials are ketones themselves, but that doesn't make sense because reducing a ketone would give an alcohol, but the product is a ketone.

Wait, perhaps the starting materials are some kind of bicyclic compounds. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, maybe the starting materials are cyclic ethers with a carbonyl group. For instance, maybe a cyclic ether with a ketone substituent. But I'm not quite getting it.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are esters. Let me think: if I have a β-keto ester, like a pentanoate with a ketone group, and when reduced, it forms a ketone.

Wait, looking at the options, the starting materials are both (S) and (R) forms of 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. Hmm. So, the starting material is a pentanoic acid derivative with an ester group and a ketone.

Wait, wait. Let me look at the options. Option D says A is (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, and B is (S) of the same structure. So, pentanoic acid with substituents.

So, the structure is: pentanoic acid (five carbons), with a ketone group (oxo) at position 5, an isobutoxy group at position 5, and an ethyl group at position 3.

Wait, that seems a bit confusing. Let me try to sketch it:

Carboxylic acid group is at position 1 (since it's pentanoic acid). So positions are 1 (COOH), 2, 3, 4, 5 (CH3 probably).

At position 5, there's an oxo group (O) and an isobutoxy group. Wait, that can't be right. Alternatively, perhaps it's a substitution on the same carbon. So, position 5 is a carbon with both an O (as in a ketone) and an O-isobutyl group.

Wait, but a carbon can't have both a ketone (O) and an ether group (another O) unless it's a geminal di-substitution.

Wait, geminal di-substituted carbonyl? Hmm. Wait, that would be a structure where the same carbon has both an O (as in a ketone) and another group attached via O (like an ether). So, perhaps it's a cyclic ketal or something.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about the structure. If the starting material is 5-oxo-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-pentanoic acid, then the structure is:

CH2-COOH
|
CH(CH2CH(CH2)2)
|
O=C-O-R ?

Wait, no. Alternatively, perhaps it's 3-ethyl, 5 position has both a ketone and an isobutoxy group. Wait, that would imply that the same carbon has both an O (from the ketone) and another O (from the isobutoxy), but that would require that carbon to have four bonds. So, let me think.

If the structure is pentanoic acid, then the chain is:

CH2-CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-C(O-R)-COOH?

Wait, not exactly. Let me number the chain. For pentanoic acid, it's CH2CH2CH2CH2COOH, but with substituents.

Wait, the correct structure is 3-ethyl, 5-oxo, 5-isobutoxy. So the chain is:

Position 1: COOH

Position 2: CH2

Position 3: CH(CH2CH2CH3) (ethyl group)

Position 4: CH2

Position 5: C(O) (oxo group), and also an O-isobutyl group.

Wait, so position 5 is a carbonyl group, and also has an oxygen attached (the isobutoxy group). So, that would mean the structure is:

Position 5: C(O) connected to an O-isobutyl group. So, the structure would be a β-keto ester, perhaps? Or a cyclic ketal.

Wait, but how would that reduce to the product?

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic hemiacetal or acetal.

Wait, let me think about the reaction. The product is a cyclic ketone, so maybe the starting material is a cyclic hemiacetal which, upon reduction, opens up to form the ketone.

Wait, but how would LiBH4 or BH3 reduce a cyclic hemiacetal into a ketone? Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a β-keto ester. When you reduce a β-keto ester, you might get a ketone. But wait, β-keto esters upon reduction with LiAlH4 typically form secondary alcohols, not ketones. Unless it's a different kind of reduction.

Wait, maybe it's a Claisen-Schmidt condensation product. But that's for forming ketones from aldehydes and ketones, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is an acyloin, but that's for forming alkanes.

Wait, perhaps the starting materials are cyclic acetals. So, when you reduce a cyclic acetal, you break the acetal and form a diol. But that's not a ketone. Hmm, maybe I'm getting stuck here.

Wait, let me think about the reaction conditions. The first reaction uses LiBH4 and H+. The second uses BH3 and H+. Both are reducing agents.

Wait, but LiBH4 is a stronger reducing agent than BH3. So, perhaps the starting materials are different in a way that their reduction leads to different configurations.

Wait, the product is an (R) and (S) enantiomers. So, the starting materials must have had a chiral center that upon reduction, the configuration is inverted or retained based on the reducing agent.

Wait, I remember that in borohydride reductions, the stereochemistry can be affected. Wait, but for ketones being reduced to secondary alcohols, the attack of the hydride is from the less hindered side, leading to the formation of the alcohol with a specific configuration.

Wait, but in this case, the product is a ketone, not an alcohol. So, perhaps the starting material was a different kind of group that, upon reduction, forms a ketone.

Wait, perhaps the starting materials are epoxides. When you reduce an epoxide with a hydride, you get a diol. But that's not a ketone. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the starting materials are ketals. For example, a cyclic ketal. When you reduce a cyclic ketal with LiBH4, what happens? Let me think. Cyclic ketals are typically made from diols and ketones or aldehydes. So, when you reduce a cyclic ketal, perhaps you break the acetal and form an alcohol.

Wait, but that would give a diol. Hmm, not matching the product.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the starting materials are cyclic esters (lactones). Reducing a lactone would open it to form a diol. But again, not a ketone.

Wait, I'm starting to think that maybe the starting materials are epoxides, but that doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a carbonyl group that is part of a larger ring, and upon reduction, it forms a ketone.

Wait, another thought—maybe the starting materials are acid derivatives. For example, an acyl chloride. But that doesn't make sense with the product.

Wait, perhaps the starting materials are β-keto esters. So, when you reduce a β-keto ester, you can get a ketone. Let me think: β-keto esters (like ethyl acetoacetate) upon reduction with LiAlH4 would typically form secondary alcohols, but maybe under certain conditions they can form ketones. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reduction is not of a ketone but of something else. Wait, maybe the starting materials are esters of a ketone. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the possible options and what they could reduce to.

Looking at the options, both A and B in each option are the same compound but with different configurations. So, for the product, when they are treated with different reducing agents, the configuration changes.

Wait, so the product is (R) when treated with LiBH4 and (S) when treated with BH3, or vice versa.

I remember that in the reduction of ketals, the configuration can be influenced by the reducing agent. Alternatively, perhaps the starting material has a chiral center adjacent to the carbonyl group, and the reduction leads to inversion or retention.

Wait, for example, in the reduction of a ketone to an alcohol, the hydride attacks the carbonyl carbon. The configuration of the adjacent chiral center would influence the approach of the hydride, leading to the formation of the alcohol with a specific configuration.

Wait, but in this problem, the product is a ketone. So, the starting material must have been something that, when reduced, forms a ketone. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are esters of a β-keto acid. When you reduce a β-keto ester, you can form a ketone. For example, if the ester is RCO-COOR', reducing it could form RCOH and R'OH. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, perhaps the ester is part of a larger ring.

Wait, another approach: the product is a cyclic ketone, so the starting material must have been a cyclic ester (lactone) which, upon reduction, forms the cyclic ketone. No, that doesn't fit because lactones are esters, and reducing them would give diols, not ketones.

Wait, perhaps the starting materials are cyclic ethers with a carbonyl group. Let me think, if the starting material is a cyclic ether with a carbonyl group attached, then reducing that would break the ether and form a ketone.

Wait, but I'm not sure about the mechanism here.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ketone with an additional group that, upon reduction, forms the product. But no, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, maybe the starting materials are acetals. So, if you have a cyclic acetal, and you reduce it, perhaps that breaks the acetal and forms a diol. But again, that would give an alcohol, not a ketone.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic hemiacetal, which upon reduction releases a diol and a ketone. Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe it's time to think about the options given.

The options for A and B are (S) and (R) configurations of (3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid). So, the starting materials are pentanoic acid derivatives with substituents at positions 3 and 5.

So, the structure is:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-CH2-C(O-O-R), where R is isobutyl.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the same carbon (position 5) can't have both a ketone and an isobutoxy group. Wait, unless it's a structure where the same carbon has both groups.

Ah, perhaps it's a β-keto ester. So, the structure would be:

COOH-CH2-C(O)-O-CH2CH(CH2)2 (isobutoxy), but I'm not sure.

Wait, no, the substituents are at position 3 and 5. So, the chain would be:

1: COOH

2: CH2

3: CH(CH2CH2CH3)

4: CH2

5: C(O-)O-isobutyl

Wait, so position 5 has a carbonyl group attached to an oxygen (an ester group). So, the structure is a β-keto ester. So, the starting material is a β-keto ester, specifically 5-isobutoxy-5-oxo-pentanoic acid, with an ethyl group at position 3.

Wait, now, when you reduce a β-keto ester, what happens? Let's think. β-keto esters have the structure R-CO-COOR'. Reducing them typically gives R-CH2-COOR', but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps in the presence of a hydride reagent, the ester is reduced to a primary alcohol, but that's not directly applicable here.

Wait, another possibility: the β-keto ester could undergo a reduction that leads to the formation of a cyclic ketone.

Wait, perhaps the β-keto ester is part of a five-membered ring. Wait, but the product is a six-membered ring. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material, upon reduction, undergoes a cyclization to form the cyclic ketone.

Wait, but how? Let's think, when a β-keto ester is reduced, maybe it forms a diol, but that doesn't form a cyclic ketone.

Wait, maybe the starting material is a β-keto ester that, upon reduction, loses a water molecule to form a cyclic ketone.

Wait, that might require a elimination reaction, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is an acyloin. Wait, acyloins are used in the formation of alkanes, not ketones.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the reagents and their effect on the stereochemistry.

So, the product is (R) or (S) depending on the reagent. The starting material has a chiral center, and upon reduction, the configuration determines the product's configuration.

In the case of LiBH4, it's a strong reducing agent and typically provides high stereoselectivity. With BH3, which is a weaker agent, perhaps the stereoselectivity is different.

Wait, but in the case of ketone reductions, the hydride attacks the carbonyl carbon from the less hindered side, leading to the formation of the alcohol with a specific configuration. But in this case, the product is a ketone, so it's not a reduction of a ketone.

Wait, another thought: maybe the starting materials are epoxide rings with a substituent that upon reduction forms a ketone.

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the starting materials are cyclic ethers with a ketone group. When reduced, the ether breaks, and the ketone is formed. But again, not sure.

Wait, maybe the starting material is a cyclic ether with a ketone substituent. So, upon reduction, the ring breaks, and the ketone is formed.

Wait, but I'm stuck. Let me think about the options again.

The options are:

A) A and B are both (S) configuration.

B) Both (R).

C) A is (S), B is (R).

D) A is (R), B is (S).

The correct answer is either C or D, since in the reactions, the products are enantiomers, which suggests that the starting materials must have been enantiomers as well, and the reagents caused the opposite configurations.

Wait, but the product is (R) and (S) from A and B.

So, if A gives (R), and B gives (S), then A and B must be enantiomers. Because the same starting material with opposite configurations would give opposite products.

Looking at the options, option D says A is (R) and B is (S). Option C says the opposite.

So, now the question is: which reagent (LiBH4 or BH3) would cause the formation of R or S.

Wait, I recall that when using different reducing agents, the configuration can change. LiBH4 is a stronger reducing agent and tends to give more inversion perhaps.

Wait, in the reduction of ketones to secondary alcohols, the configuration depends on the approach of the hydride. If the starting ketone is chiral, the hydride would approach from the less hindered side, leading to the formation of the alcohol with a specific configuration.

But again, the product here is a ketone, not an alcohol, so perhaps the starting material is a cyclic hemiacetal that upon reduction forms the ketone with a specific configuration.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic hemiacetal ester. So, when you reduce it, the ring opens, and the ketone is formed.

Wait, but the product is a cyclic ketone, so maybe the starting material is a cyclic hemiacetal that, upon reduction, the ring remains but the functional group changes.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ester (lactone) that, upon reduction, forms a cyclic ketone. But I don't think that's possible.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a γ-keto ester. Wait, no, because reducing a γ-keto ester would form something else.

Hmm. Maybe I should think about the reaction mechanism. Let's say the starting material is a β-keto ester. When reduced, perhaps the ester is reduced to an alcohol, but the ketone remains.

Wait, but that would give a secondary alcohol and a ketone, which doesn't fit with the product being a cyclic ketone.

Another angle: the product is 4-ethyltetrahydropyran-2-one. So, it's a six-membered ring. To form this, perhaps the starting material undergoes a cyclization upon reduction.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a diol with an ester group, and when treated with a reducing agent, it forms the cyclic ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a β-hydroxy ester, and upon reduction, it loses water to form the ketone and the ring.

Wait, that makes sense. So, if the starting material is a β-hydroxy ester, then under acidic conditions, it could undergo elimination to form a ketone and a ring.

Wait, but how does the reducing agent come into play here?

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a β-keto ester, and upon reduction, it loses CO2 to form the ketone.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a β-keto ester, which upon treatment with a reducing agent, undergoes decarboxylation to form a ketone.

Wait, decarboxylation of β-keto esters typically occurs upon heating, but perhaps the reducing agent facilitates this.

Wait, if the starting material is a β-keto ester, and under the influence of LiBH4 or BH3, it decarboxylates to form a ketone. The stereochemistry would depend on the configuration of the starting material and the reducing agent.

So, in this case, the starting material A and B are enantiomers, and the reagents cause the formation of opposite configurations in the product.

So, let's say when A (R configuration) is treated with LiBH4, it forms (R) product, and when B (S) is treated with BH3, it forms (S) product. But wait, the product configurations are (R) and (S), so perhaps the opposite happens.

Alternatively, perhaps the enantioselectivity is determined by the reducing agent.

Wait, I remember that in the reduction of ketones, the approach of the hydride can be influenced by the presence of bulky groups. For example, in the reduction of a ketone with adjacent chiral centers, the hydride would approach from the less hindered side, leading to the formation of the alcohol with a specific configuration.

But since the product here is a ketone, maybe the starting material is a cyclic hemiacetal, and the reduction leads to the formation of the ketone with a specific configuration.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic hemiacetal with a β-keto ester group. When reduced, the ring opens, and the ketone remains.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic hemiacetal, and the reduction leads to the ring remaining as a ketone.

Wait, I'm getting stuck again. Let me think about the possible answer based on the options.

Since both reactions produce enantiomers, the starting materials (A and B) must be enantiomers of each other. So, the correct options are either C or D.

Now, the question is, which reagent (LiBH4 or BH3) would lead to which configuration.

I think that when using a stronger reducing agent like LiBH4, the approach of the hydride may be more controlled, leading to a specific configuration. Alternatively, BH3 might be less selective, leading to retention or inversion.

Wait, no, wait. In the reduction of ketones, the approach of the hydride is from the less hindered face. If the starting material has a specific configuration, the resulting alcohol's configuration would depend on that.

Wait, but in this problem, the product is a ketone, not an alcohol. So, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ether with a carbonyl group, and the reduction leads to the formation of a ketone.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ether with a carbonyl substituent, and upon reduction, the ether breaks, releasing the carbonyl group as a ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a β-keto ester, and the reduction leads to the loss of the ester group and the formation of a ketone.

Wait, perhaps the mechanism is the reduction of the ester group to a primary alcohol, but that doesn't form a ketone.

Wait, this is getting too tangled. Let me try to make an educated guess.

The product is a cyclic ketone. The starting materials are enantiomers. The reagents are LiBH4 and BH3. The product's configuration depends on which reagent is used.

If the starting material is an R configuration and treated with LiBH4, perhaps it leads to the R product, and with BH3, it leads to S.

Alternatively, it could be the opposite.

But I'm not certain. Looking at the options, option D has A as R and B as S. So, if A is treated with LiBH4, which produces R, and B (S) is treated with BH3, which produces S, that would make the products enantiomers.

Alternatively, the opposite could be true.

Wait, perhaps the hydride approaches from a different face depending on the reducing agent, leading to opposite configurations.

I think in ketone reductions, the approach of the hydride is influenced by the structure. If the starting material is a β-keto ester with a specific configuration, the reduction could form the ketone with opposite configuration.

Alternatively, maybe the configuration is retained. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option D: A is (R) and B is (S). So, when treated with LiBH4, A gives (R), and when B is treated with BH3, it gives (S).

But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, the opposite could be true.

Wait, another approach: think about whether the reducing agents cause retention or inversion of configuration.

In the reduction of ketones to secondary alcohols, the configuration of the alcohol is anti to the leaving group (the carbonyl oxygen). So, if the starting material is R, the product would be S, perhaps. But I'm not exactly sure.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should consider that the correct answer is D, where A is R and B is S. So when A is reduced with LiBH4, it gives R, and B (S) with BH3 gives S.

Alternatively, perhaps the opposite.

I think I'll go with option D, but I'm not entirely certain.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves two reactions where unknown compounds A and B are treated with different reducing agents, LiBH4 and BH3, to produce enantiomers of 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, specifically (R)- and (S)-configurations. The goal is to determine the correct starting materials A and B from the given options.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Product Structure**: The product is a cyclic ketone, 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. This suggests that the starting materials must be compounds that can form this ketone upon reduction.

2. **Reagents and Stereochemistry**: 
   - LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, while BH3 is weaker and less selective.
   - The stereochemistry of the product depends on the configuration of the starting material and the reducing agent used. The enantiomeric products indicate that the starting materials must also be enantiomers.

3. **Starting Material Options**:
   - The options provided describe A and B as enantiomers of (3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid). This compound likely forms the cyclic ketone product upon reduction, with the stereochemistry of the product depending on the configuration of the starting material and the reducing agent.

4. **Reaction Logic**:
   - When a β-keto ester like the starting material is reduced, the stereochemistry of the product is determined by the approach of the hydride ion. The stronger reducing agent (LiBH4) may influence the hydride to attack from a specific face, leading to a specific configuration in the product.
   - Similarly, BH3, being less selective, may lead to the opposite configuration when acting on the enantiomeric starting material.

5. **Enantiomeric Relationship**:
   - For the products to be enantiomers, the starting materials must also be enantiomers. This means if A is (R), B must be (S), and vice versa.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the correct pairing of starting materials is A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid and B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. This ensures that the reduction with LiBH4 and BH3 produces the enantiomeric products (R)- and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, respectively.

**Answer: D**
