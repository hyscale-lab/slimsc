Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius 2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). I remember that in general relativity, the metric tensor describes the geometry of spacetime. But since this question is about a pseudosphere, which is a type of surface in hyperbolic geometry, maybe it's a 2-dimensional metric.

Wait, pseudosphere usually refers to something with negative curvature. Oh right, the metric might be conformally flat because it has a (dx² + dy²) term multiplied by a function. So the line element looks like ds² = f(x,y) (dx² + dy²), which is a conformal metric. 

The problem is asking for the area of the pseudosphere with radius r=2. Wait, radius in this context—does that refer to a certain parameter in the metric? Let me think, in the metric, the denominator is (4 - x² - y²). Since 4 is 2 squared, so 4 = (2)^2. So maybe this is related to the radius of the pseudosphere being 2.

I recall that the area of a surface can be found using the metric. In 2D, the area element is sqrt(g) dx dy, where g is the determinant of the metric tensor. But wait, here the metric is diagonal, so the determinant would be the product of the diagonal terms. 

The given metric is in terms of dx and dy. The metric tensor components are g_xx = 32/(4 - x² - y²), and g_yy = same as g_xx, and g_xy = 0. So the determinant g is (32/(4 - x² - y²))². Therefore, the area element dA is sqrt(g) dx dy. Wait, sqrt of (32/(4 - x² - y²))² is 32/(4 -x² - y²). So dA = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] dx dy.

But wait, what's the domain of x and y? The denominator (4 - x² - y²) must be positive to have real distances, so x² + y² < 4. So the coordinates x and y are confined to a circle of radius 2 in the plane. That makes sense because the pseudosphere's "radius" is 2.

Wait, but what is the area of the pseudosphere? I remember that in hyperbolic geometry, the area of a surface is different from Euclidean. But wait, no, this is a 2D surface embedded in some way, so maybe the metric is conformally related to the Euclidean metric.

Alternatively, perhaps this is a model of hyperbolic space. The Poincaré disk model comes to mind, where the metric is (4/(1 - r²)^2) (dr² + r² dθ²), but that's in polar coordinates. Let me see, the given metric is in Cartesian coordinates.

Wait, the Poincaré disk model has metric ds² = 4/(1 - x² - y²)^2 (dx² + dy²). So comparing that to the given metric, which is 32/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Let me see, 32 = 4 * 8, and 4 - x² - y² = 4(1 - (x² + y²)/4 ) = 4 (1 - (r²)/4 ), where r² = x² + y². So 4 - r² = 4 (1 - r²/(4)).

So the given metric is [32/(4 - r²)] (dx² + dy²) = [8/(1 - (r²)/4)] (dx² + dy²). Hmm, comparing to the Poincaré disk model, which is [4/(1 - r²)] (dr² + r² dθ²). Wait, that's different because in the Poincaré disk, the denominator is (1 - r²), whereas here, it's (1 - r²/4), and the scaling factor is 8 instead of 4.

So perhaps this is a scaled version. Let me think about the radius in the Poincaré disk model. The model typically has a curvature, say K, and the radius is related to the curvature. K is negative for hyperbolic geometry. The curvature is given by K = -1/(R^2), where R is the radius of curvature. But I'm not sure, maybe it's K = -1/(4r^2) or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the given metric represents a pseudosphere of radius 2, which would relate to the denominator 4 - r². So when r approaches 2, the denominator goes to zero, so the metric becomes singular, which is typical of the edge of a pseudosphere where it ends.

But back to the area. The area in the Poincaré disk model is finite even though the disk is of finite radius. Wait, no, the Poincaré disk model has infinite area because as you approach the boundary, the area element increases without bound. So for the given metric, the area element is dA = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] dx dy, which tends to infinity as x² + y² approaches 4.

Wait, but the question is about the area of the pseudosphere of radius 2. If the area is calculated by integrating dA over the allowed domain, which is x² + y² <4, then the integral would be ∫∫ [32/(4 - (x² + y²))] dx dy over x² + y² <4. Let me compute that.

Switching to polar coordinates, x² + y² = r², dx dy = r dr dθ. So the integral becomes ∫ (θ=0 to 2π) ∫ (r=0 to 2) [32/(4 - r²)] * r dr dθ.

Let me compute the radial integral first. The integral over θ is 2π. So the area is 2π * ∫ (from 0 to 2) [32 r/(4 - r²)] dr.

Let me compute this integral. Let u = 4 - r², then du = -2r dr. So (32/(4 - r²)) * r dr = (32/(u)) * (-du/2) = -16 (du/u) → integral becomes ∫ from u=4 (r=0) to u=0 (r=2) of (-16) (1/u) du. Wait, but the limits would be from r=0 (u=4) to r=2 (u=0), so the integral becomes:

-16 ∫ (from 4 to 0) (1/u) du = -16 [ln u from 4 to 0] = -16 (ln 0 - ln 4). But ln 0 is negative infinity, so this would be -16 (-infty - ln4) → positive infinity. So the integral diverges to infinity. Therefore, the area is infinite.

Wait, but the options don't have an infinite area except option D, which is +infty. So the answer would be D?

Wait, but wait. The question is about the pseudosphere of radius 2. Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the area of the surface with the model's properties. Wait, the Poincaré disk model is a model of hyperbolic plane, which has infinite area. But a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature, and its Gaussian curvature is K = -1/R², for radius R. Wait, but in the metric given, is the Gaussian curvature negative?

Let me compute the Gaussian curvature to confirm. For a conformally flat metric, the Gaussian curvature can be found using the formula:

K = - (1/(2f)) [ (Δ f) + ( ( ∇f ) · ( ∇f ) ) / f ]

Wait, or another way, for a metric f(dx² + dy²), the curvature is:

K = - (1/(2 f²)) [ f Δ f + (∇f)^2 ]

Wait, I might be getting the exact expression wrong, but perhaps another approach is better. Alternatively, I can compute the Ricci scalar, but perhaps for a 2D metric, it's the same as the Gaussian curvature.

Alternatively, I can compute the Gaussian curvature by using the formula for a metric ds² = E dx² + 2F dxdy + G dy². In our case, E = G = 32/(4 - x² - y²), and F=0. The Gaussian curvature K is given by:

K = ( - (E G)^(1/2) ) * [ (E G_{yy} - G E_{yy})/(E G) ) ... Wait, perhaps it's better to look for a general formula for the Gaussian curvature of a conformal metric.

Yes, for a metric conformal to Euclidean, ds² = f(x,y) (dx² + dy²), the Gaussian curvature is given by:

K = - (1/(2 f)) [ f Laplacian of f + (grad f)^2 ]

Wait, perhaps I should compute it. Let's define f(x,y) = 32/(4 - x² - y²).

So first, compute the Laplacian of f. Let me compute it.

f(x,y) = 32/(4 - x² - y²) = 32/(4 - r²), where r² = x² + y².

In Cartesian coordinates, the Laplacian is the sum of the second derivatives with respect to x and y.

First, compute the first derivatives:

df/dx = (32) * (2x)/(4 - r²)^2.

Similarly, df/dy = (32) * (2y)/(4 - r²)^2.

Now, the second derivatives.

d²f/dx² = 32 [ (2(4 - r²)^2 * 2) - (2x)(2)(4 - r²)(-2x) ) ] / (4 - r²)^4.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute in polar coordinates.

In polar coordinates, r is sqrt(x² + y²), and θ is the angle. The Laplacian in 2D polar coordinates is (1/r) d/dr (r df/dr) + (1/r²) d²f/dθ².

But since f depends only on r, the θ derivative is zero. So Laplacian f = (1/r) d/dr (r df/dr).

Let me compute df/dr.

df/dr = d/d r [32/(4 - r²)] = 32*(2r)/(4 - r²)^2.

Wait, no: derivative of 32/(4 - r²) is 32 * (0 - (-2r)) / (4 - r²)^2 → 32*(2r)/(4 - r²)^2 → 64 r / (4 - r²)^2.

So, df/dr = 64 r / (4 - r²)^2.

Now, r df/dr = r * [64 r / (4 - r²)^2 ] = 64 r² / (4 - r²)^2.

Now, d/dr [ r df/dr ] = d/dr [64 r² / (4 - r²)^2 ].

Let me compute that.

Let me set u = r², v = (4 - r²)^2.

du/dr = 2r, dv/dr = 2(4 - r²)(-2r) = -4r (4 - r²).

So using the quotient rule:

d/dr [64 r²/(4 - r²)^2 ] = 64 [ (2r)(4 - r²)^2 - r² * 2(4 - r²)(-2r) ] / (4 - r²)^4.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute directly:

Let me write 64 r² = 64 r², and denominator (4 - r²)^2.

The derivative is:

64 [ (2r) (4 - r²)^2 - r² * 2(4 - r²)(-2r) ) ] / (4 - r²)^4.

Wait, that seems complicated. Alternatively, let me compute it as:

d/dr [ 64 r² (4 - r²)^{-2} ] = 64 [ (2r)(4 - r²)^{-2} + r² (-2)(4 - r²)^{-3} (-2r) ) ].

Wait, using the product rule: derivative of r² is 2r, times (4 - r²)^{-2}, plus r² times derivative of (4 - r²)^{-2}.

The derivative of (4 - r²)^{-2} is (-2)(4 - r²)^{-3} (-2r) ) = 4r (4 - r²)^{-3}.

So putting together:

= 64 [ 2r (4 - r²)^{-2} + r² * 4r (4 - r²)^{-3} ) ]

Factor out 2r (4 - r²)^{-3}:

= 64 * 2r (4 - r²)^{-3} [ (4 - r²) + 2 r² ]

Simplify inside the brackets:

(4 - r² + 2 r²) = 4 + r².

So,

= 64 * 2r (4 + r²) / (4 - r²)^3.

So that's the numerator. So, the derivative is 128 r (4 + r²) / (4 - r²)^3.

But wait, the Laplacian is (1/r) * this derivative.

So,

Laplacian f = (1/r) * [128 r (4 + r²) / (4 - r²)^3 ] = 128 (4 + r²)/(4 - r²)^3.

Now, the gradient squared term is (∂f/∂x)^2 + (∂f/∂y)^2. Wait, in 2D, the gradient squared is (∇f)^2 = (df/dx)^2 + (df/dy)^2. Since f is a function of r, we can compute this as 2 r (df/dr)^2, perhaps? Because in polar coordinates, df/dx = (df/dr)(dr/dx) ) = df/dr * (x/r), and similarly for df/dy. So (df/dx)^2 + (df/dy)^2 = (df/dr)^2 (x² + y²)/r² = (df/dr)^2 r² / r² = (df/dr)^2.

Wait, wait, no. Let me think: df/dx = (df/dr) * (dr/dx) = (df/dr) * (x/r). Similarly, df/dy = (df/dr) * (y/r). So (df/dx)^2 + (df/dy)^2 = (df/dr)^2 (x² + y²)/(r²) ) = (df/dr)^2 r² / r² = (df/dr)^2.

Wait, so (∇f)^2 = (df/dx)^2 + (df/dy)^2 = (df/dr)^2.

Wait, that can't be right. Because dr/dx = x/r, so df/dx = (df/dr) * (x/r), same for y. So when you square and add, you get (df/dr)^2 (x² + y²)/r² ) = (df/dr)^2 (r²)/ r² ) = (df/dr)^2.

Ah, right, so (∇f)^2 = (df/dr)^2.

So now, the Gaussian curvature K is given by:

K = -(1/(2 f)) [ f Δ f + ( ∇f )² ]

Wait, let me confirm. I found a formula that says for a metric ds² = λ(dx² + dy²), the Gaussian curvature is K = - (1/(2 λ)) [ (Δ λ) + ( ( ∇λ ) · ( ∇λ ) ) / λ ]

Wait, maybe. So substituting in:

Δ λ = Laplacian of f = 128 (4 + r²)/(4 - r²)^3.

So,

K = -(1/(2 f)) [ (128 (4 + r²)/(4 - r²)^3) + ( (df/dr)^2 ) / f ) ]

Wait, because ( ∇f )² = (df/dr)^2.

So let me compute each term.

First, f = 32/(4 - r²).

So, 1/(2 f) = (4 - r²)/(64).

Then, the first term inside the brackets is (128 (4 + r²))/(4 - r²)^3.

The second term is (df/dr)^2 / f.

We have df/dr = 64 r/(4 - r²)^2.

So (df/dr)^2 = (64 r)^2 / (4 - r²)^4 = 4096 r² / (4 - r²)^4.

Divided by f, which is 32/(4 - r²), this becomes (4096 r² / (4 - r²)^4) * (4 - r²)/32 ) = (4096 r² (4 - r²)) / (32 (4 - r²)^4) ) = (4096 /32) * r² / (4 - r²)^3 ) = 128 r² / (4 - r²)^3.

So putting it together, the terms inside the brackets are:

[128 (4 + r²)/(4 - r²)^3 + 128 r²/(4 - r²)^3 ) ]

Factor out 128/(4 - r²)^3:

= 128/(4 - r²)^3 [ (4 + r²) + r² ] = 128/(4 - r²)^3 (4 + 2 r²).

So,

K = -(1/(2 f)) * [ 128 (4 + 2 r^2) / (4 - r^2)^3 ) ]

We know that 1/(2 f) is (4 - r²)/(64).

So,

K = -( (4 - r²)/(64) ) * [ 128 (4 + 2 r^2) / (4 - r^2)^3 ) ]

Simplify numerator and denominators:

= -( (4 - r²) * 128 (4 + 2 r^2) ) / (64 (4 - r^2)^3 ) )

= -( 128 (4 + 2 r^2) (4 - r^2) ) / (64 (4 - r^2)^3 ) )

Simplify 128/64 = 2.

= -( 2 (4 + 2 r^2) (4 - r^2) ) / ( (4 - r^2)^3 ) )

= -( 2 (4 + 2 r^2) ) / ( (4 - r^2)^2 ) )

Factor numerator:

4 + 2 r² = 2 (2 + r² )

So,

K = -( 2 * 2 (2 + r²) ) / ( (4 - r^2)^2 ) ) = -(4 (2 + r^2) ) / (4 - r^2)^2 )

But wait, for a pseudosphere (which has constant negative curvature), this expression should be a constant. Let me check if it is.

Wait, but if the curvature is not constant, perhaps the metric isn't that of a pseudosphere. Hmm, but the question says it's a pseudosphere of radius 2. So maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have a different approach. The given metric is for a pseudosphere, which has constant negative curvature. So the Gaussian curvature should be a constant negative value.

Wait, let me think again. For the metric ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²), which can be written as ds² = (32)/(4 - r²) (dr² + r^2 dθ²).

Wait, in polar coordinates, that's correct. But perhaps for a pseudosphere, the metric is ds² = (R²) / (R² - r²) (dr² + r^2 dθ²), where R is the radius of the pseudosphere. Hmm, if that's the case, then in our metric, 32 = R², and 4 - r² = R² - r² → R²=4 → R=2.

So comparing, the metric would be ds² = R²/(R² - r²) (dr² + r² dθ²) → with R=2, that would be 4/(4 - r²) (dr² + r² dθ²). But our given metric is 32/(4 - r²) (dr² + r² dθ²), which is 8 times larger. So 32 = 8 *4 → 8 R². Hmm, so perhaps the scaling is off. Or perhaps I'm confusing the model.

But perhaps the area of a pseudosphere is 4π R², but with R=2, that would be 16π. But that's a sphere, not a pseudosphere. Wait, but pseudosphere is a hyperbolic surface, which is non-compact and has infinite area. Wait, no, wait. A pseudosphere is a finite area surface with infinite extent. Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting mixed up.

Wait, the standard pseudosphere, like the tractricoid, has finite area. Oh right, the tractricoid is a surface of constant negative curvature with finite area. So perhaps the area is 4π R², similar to a sphere. But wait, for a sphere of radius R, the area is 4π R². But for a pseudosphere, maybe the area is 4π R² as well, but with R being the radius of curvature.

Wait, but in our case, the metric's denominator is 4 - r², which is R² - r², with R=2. So perhaps the area is 4π R², which would be 16π. But looking at the options, none of them have 16π. The options are A)0, B)4π(x²+y^2), C)4π(x² - y²), D) +infty.

Wait, that suggests perhaps I'm miscalculating the area.

Wait, wait, earlier when I tried to compute the area by integrating, I found that the area is infinite. But that's because the metric's area element is [32/(4 - r²)] r dr dθ. The integral over r from 0 to 2 would be ∫0^2 [32 r/(4 - r²)] dr. Let me compute that integral again.

Let me make substitution u =4 - r², so du = -2r dr → r dr = -du/2.

Limits: when r=0, u=4; when r=2, u=0.

So the integral becomes:

∫ (32 * (-du/2)) / u → ∫ from 4 to 0 ( -16 du / u ) → which is -16 ∫ from 4 →0 (1/u du) → -16 [ ln u ] from 4 to 0.

But ln 0 is negative infinity, so this becomes -16 ( -infty - ln4 ) → +infty.

So the area is infinite. So the answer should be option D.

But wait, the question says "the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2." So perhaps the pseudosphere has infinite area. That makes sense because the pseudosphere extends infinitely in some sense. Wait, no, no, the tractricoid is a finite area surface. But perhaps in the context of this metric, it's an infinite area.

Alternatively, perhaps the confusion is between the model's "radius" and the actual pseudosphere's radius. So perhaps the metric given is not of a tractricoid but of a hyperbolic plane, which has infinite area.

Wait, the Poincaré disk model has infinite area, just like the hyperbolic plane. So if the metric is similar to the Poincaré disk model, then the area would be infinite. But the pseudosphere (tractricoid) is a finite area surface.

Wait, but the given metric is in terms of dx and dy, not in polar coordinates, but the denominator is 4 - x² - y², which in polar becomes 4 - r².

So, perhaps the metric describes the entire hyperbolic plane, which has infinite area. In that case, the area would be infinite, so option D.

Alternatively, perhaps the radius in the question refers to something else. Let me think again about the metric. The denominator is 4 - r², which suggests that the model is cut off at r=2. So the area is over the region r <2, but as we saw, the integral diverges to infinity, so the area is infinite.

So, the correct answer would be D) +infty.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The metric provided is:

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left(dx^2 + dy^2\right).
\]

This is a conformally flat metric, where the line element is scaled by the function \( f(x, y) = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \). The domain of \( x \) and \( y \) is restricted to \( x^2 + y^2 < 4 \), ensuring the denominator remains positive and avoiding singularities.

To compute the area of the pseudosphere of radius \( r = 2 \), we calculate the area element \( dA \) from the metric. For a conformally flat metric, the area element is:

\[
dA = \sqrt{\det(g)} \, dx \, dy = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \, dx \, dy.
\]

Switching to polar coordinates (\( r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \), \( \theta \)), the area element becomes:

\[
dA = \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \cdot r \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

The total area is then:

\[
A = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^2 \frac{32 r}{4 - r^2} \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

The angular integral over \( \theta \) contributes a factor of \( 2\pi \), leaving:

\[
A = 2\pi \int_0^2 \frac{32 r}{4 - r^2} \, dr.
\]

To evaluate the radial integral, substitute \( u = 4 - r^2 \), so \( du = -2r \, dr \), and \( r \, dr = -\frac{1}{2} du \). The limits of integration change as follows: when \( r = 0 \), \( u = 4 \); when \( r = 2 \), \( u = 0 \). The integral becomes:

\[
\int_0^2 \frac{32 r}{4 - r^2} \, dr = -16 \int_4^0 \frac{1}{u} \, du = -16 \left[\ln u\right]_4^0.
\]

As \( u \to 0 \), \( \ln u \to -\infty \), so the integral diverges to \( +\infty \). This indicates that the area of the pseudosphere described by this metric is infinite.

The metric resembles the Poincaré disk model of hyperbolic geometry, which also has infinite area. The radius \( r = 2 \) corresponds to the boundary of the disk where the metric becomes singular. Since the area element diverges as \( r \to 2 \), the total area is indeed infinite.

Thus, the area of the pseudosphere of radius \( r = 2 \) is \( +\infty \).
