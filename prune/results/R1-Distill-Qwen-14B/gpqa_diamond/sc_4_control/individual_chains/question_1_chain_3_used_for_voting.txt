Okay, so I've got this question about quantum states and their energy differences. Hmm, the question says that two states have energies E1 and E2 with lifetimes of 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds. We need to figure out the energy difference that allows them to be clearly distinguished.

Wait, I remember something about the uncertainty principle. Oh right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. It relates the uncertainty in energy and the uncertainty in time. The formula I think is ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant. But wait, how does this apply here?

So, each quantum state has a certain lifetime, which is like the uncertainty in time Δt. The energy uncertainty ΔE is related to the lifetime. A shorter lifetime means a larger energy uncertainty, right? Because if the state doesn't last very long, we can't know its energy very precisely.

The goal is to have the energy difference between E1 and E2 be larger than the sum of their individual uncertainties. Otherwise, they might not be distinguishable. So the difference ΔE should be bigger than the uncertainty from each state.

Let me think about the formula again. The energy uncertainty ΔE for each state would be roughly ħ divided by the lifetime. So ΔE ≈ ħ / τ, where τ is the lifetime.

I think the reduced Planck constant ħ is about 1.0545718e-34 J·s. But sometimes people use units where ħ is 6.582e-16 eV·s when dealing with electron volts. Oh right, because 1 eV is 1.602e-19 joules. So when working in eV, ħ is approximately 6.582e-16 eV·s.

So for each state, the energy uncertainty is ΔE = ħ / τ.

Let me calculate the uncertainty for each state.

For E1, τ is 1e-9 seconds. So ΔE1 = 6.582e-16 eV·s / 1e-9 s = 6.582e-7 eV. That's like 0.6582e-6 eV.

For E2, τ is 1e-8 seconds. So ΔE2 = 6.582e-16 eV·s / 1e-8 s = 6.582e-8 eV. Approximately 0.6582e-7 eV.

Wait, but the energy difference between E1 and E2 is ΔE = E2 - E1. Oh wait, actually, it's just the absolute difference, but since E2 has a longer lifetime, its energy uncertainty is smaller than E1's.

But to resolve them, the energy difference ΔE should be larger than the sum of their uncertainties. Or is it each individual uncertainty? Hmm, I'm a bit hazy here.

Wait, when you have two states, their energy levels need to be separated by more than the uncertainty in each. So, the difference between E1 and E2 should be greater than the sum of the uncertainties of each state's energy.

Because each state's energy is uncertain by ΔE1 and ΔE2. So the minimum difference to resolve them would be when the separation is just larger than the sum of these uncertainties.

So ΔE = |E2 - E1| > ΔE1 + ΔE2.

Wait, let me think again. If E1 has uncertainty ΔE1 and E2 has ΔE2, then the uncertainty in their separation would be the sum of the uncertainties, right? So to clearly distinguish, their separation must be larger than this sum.

So let's compute ΔE1 + ΔE2. From above, ΔE1 is approximately 6.582e-7 eV, ΔE2 is 6.582e-8 eV.

Adding them: 6.582e-7 + 6.582e-8 = 7.2402e-7 eV. So approximately 7.24e-7 eV.

So the energy difference between E1 and E2 must be greater than 7.24e-7 eV. Let's look at the options.

Options are: 

A) 10^-9 eV = 1e-9 eV → 0.001e-6 eV → way smaller than 7e-7.

B) 10^-11 eV → 1e-11, even smaller.

C) 10^-4 eV → 0.0001 eV → which is 1e-4 eV, which is 1e-4 eV. Wait, 1e-4 is 0.0001 eV, which is 100000 times larger than 7.24e-7. Because 7.24e-7 is 0.000000724 eV. So 1e-4 is way bigger. So 1e-4 is much larger than needed.

D) 1e-8 eV → 0.00000001 eV, which is less than 7.24e-7. So that's 0.00000001, which is smaller than 0.000000724.

So the only option that's larger than 7.24e-7 eV is C) 1e-4 eV.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me make sure. Let me calculate 1e-4 eV compared to 7.24e-7 eV. 1e-4 is equal to 10000e-8. 7.24e-7 is 724e-9. So 1e-4 is 100 times larger than 1e-6, while 7.24e-7 is 0.724e-6. So 1e-4 is way bigger than 0.724e-6.

So the correct answer should be option C, 1e-4 eV, because that's the only one larger than the required sum.

To determine the energy difference required to clearly distinguish two quantum states with energies \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \), we use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, which relates the uncertainty in energy (\( \Delta E \)) to the uncertainty in time (\( \Delta t \)) as:

\[
\Delta E \cdot \Delta t \approx \frac{\hbar}{2},
\]

where \( \hbar \) is the reduced Planck constant. For quantum states with finite lifetimes (\( \tau \)), the energy uncertainty is approximately:

\[
\Delta E \approx \frac{\hbar}{\tau}.
\]

Given \( \hbar \approx 6.582 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{eV·s} \), we calculate the energy uncertainties for the two states:

1. For \( \tau_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \):
   \[
   \Delta E_1 = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{eV·s}}{10^{-9} \, \text{s}} = 6.582 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
   \]

2. For \( \tau_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \):
   \[
   \Delta E_2 = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{eV·s}}{10^{-8} \, \text{s}} = 6.582 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}.
   \]

To clearly distinguish the two energy levels, their energy difference \( \Delta E = |E_2 - E_1| \) must be greater than the sum of their uncertainties:

\[
\Delta E > \Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2.
\]

Adding the uncertainties:

\[
\Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2 = 6.582 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} + 6.582 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} = 7.2402 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
\]

Thus, \( \Delta E \) must be greater than \( 7.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Evaluating the options:

- **A) \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \):** \( 1 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \) is much smaller than \( 7.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \).
- **B) \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \):** \( 1 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \) is also much smaller than \( 7.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \).
- **C) \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \):** \( 1 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \) is significantly larger than \( 7.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), satisfying the condition.
- **D) \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \):** \( 1 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \) is smaller than \( 7.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \).

The only option that satisfies the condition is **C**, \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \).
