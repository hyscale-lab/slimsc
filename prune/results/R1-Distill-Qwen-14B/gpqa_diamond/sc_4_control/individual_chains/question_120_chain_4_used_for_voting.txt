Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, the question says that stars are uniformly distributed, and I need to find how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. The options are A to D, each being different inverse powers of parallax.

Wait, I'm a bit rusty on this. Let me think. Parallax is related to distance. Oh right, parallax (in parsecs) is the reciprocal of distance. So plx = 1/d, where d is distance. But wait, I think it's actually plx in arcseconds is equal to 1 over distance in parsecs. So if a star is closer, its parallax is larger.

But how does the number of stars per unit parallax change with plx? So the question is about the density of stars in terms of parallax. Since the distribution is uniform, maybe it's about how many are within a certain distance range.

Wait, stars are uniformly distributed in space, so the number density is the same everywhere. So the number of stars in a volume depends on the volume. But how does that translate to parallax?

Let me think about the volume of space where a certain parallax range exists. Parallax plx ranges from some lower value to a higher value. Wait, no, parallax decreases with distance. So a higher parallax indicates closer stars. So if I have a small range of plx, say from plx to plx + dplx, that corresponds to a certain range of distances.

Wait, distance d is 1/plx (in parsecs when plx is in arcseconds). So if plx increases, d decreases. So a small change in plx, like dplx, would correspond to a change in d. Let's calculate that.

d = 1/plx → dd = - (1/plx²) dplx. Hmm, so the change in distance dd is proportional to 1/(plx)^2 times dplx, but with a negative sign because as plx increases, d decreases.

Wait, but I'm trying to find the number of stars per unit parallax. So stars per unit plx. Let me think in terms of volume.

In three-dimensional space, the number of stars in a spherical shell of radius d and thickness dd would be the volume of the shell times the number density. But wait, assuming uniform distribution, the number of stars would be proportional to the volume. But since stars are in all directions, perhaps we can model it in a shell.

The volume of a spherical shell between d and d+dd is 4π d² dd. So the number of stars in this shell is n * 4π d² dd, where n is the number density (stars per cubic parsec, say).

But how does this relate to parallax? Well, since d = 1/plx, so plx = 1/d. So let me express everything in terms of plx.

So d = 1/plx → dd = - d^2 dplx → since d = 1/plx, then dd = -(1/plx^2) dplx.

Wait, let's plug d into the number of stars equation. So:

Number of stars = n * 4π d² dd.

But d = 1/plx, so d² = 1/(plx)^2. And dd is -(1/plx^2) dplx. So substituting:

Number of stars = n * 4π * (1/plx²) * ( - (1/plx²) dplx )

Wait, but the negative sign here indicates that as plx increases, d decreases, but since we're considering a range from plx to plx + dplx, perhaps I should take the absolute value. So maybe the number of stars is proportional to (1/plx^4) * dplx. Because:

n *4π (1/plx²) * (1/plx²) dplx ) → 4π n dplx (1/plx^4 )

So the number of stars per unit plx (dplx) is proportional to 1/(plx^4). But wait, the question is about the number per unit plx. So per unit plx, the number is 1/(plx^4) times the constants.

Wait, but the number of stars per unit range of plx (i.e., per dplx) is 4π n (1/plx^4 ) dplx. So the number per unit plx would be 4 π n (1/plx^4 ), which is proportional to 1/plx^4.

So looking at the options: option A is ~ 1/plx^4, which would be the case here.

But wait, another approach. Think about the flux. No, probably not. Alternatively, think about the luminosity distance. No, perhaps another way.

Alternatively, since the number of stars in a given volume is uniform, the number of stars between plx and plx + dplx would be proportional to the volume between those distances. So the volume element is 4π d² dd, and since d = 1/plx, then d² = 1/plx^2, and dd = -d^2 dplx = - (1/plx^2) dplx.

So volume element V = 4π (1/plx²) * (1/plx²) dplx ) = 4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

So the number of stars in that volume is n * V = n * 4π (1/plx^4 ) dplx.

Thus, the number per unit plx (dplx) is proportional to 1/(plx^4), which matches option A.

So the correct answer should be A) ~1/plx^4.

To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we start by noting that parallax is inversely related to distance: \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \), where \( d \) is the distance in parsecs. Since stars are uniformly distributed, the number of stars in a given volume is proportional to the volume itself.

The volume of a spherical shell at distance \( d \) with thickness \( dd \) is \( 4\pi d^2 dd \). Substituting \( d = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \), we find \( d^2 = \frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} \) and \( dd = -\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d\text{plx} \). The volume element becomes:

\[
V = 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2}\right) \left(-\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d\text{plx}\right) = -\frac{4\pi}{\text{plx}^4} d\text{plx}.
\]

The number of stars in this volume is proportional to the volume times the number density \( n \), giving:

\[
\text{Number of stars} \propto n \cdot \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} \cdot d\text{plx}.
\]

Thus, the number of stars per unit range of parallax (i.e., per unit \( d\text{plx} \)) is proportional to \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} \).

From the options provided, the correct answer is:

**A) ~ 1/plx^4**
