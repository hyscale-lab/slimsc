Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a go.

The problem says that the state |alpha> is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. Wait, so first, I think I need to normalize this state because the question says it's proportional, meaning it's not necessarily normalized yet. Oh right, because in quantum mechanics, states should have a norm of 1.

So the state is a linear combination of |up> and |down>, which are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. That part I'm clear on. So |up> and |down> form an orthonormal basis, right? So the inner product of |up> and |down> is zero, and each has a norm of 1.

The first step is to compute the normalization factor. The state is |alpha> = (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>, but it's proportional, so the actual state would be |alpha> = [ (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> ] divided by the normalization constant.

Wait, normalization constant N is sqrt( <alpha|alpha> ). So let's compute the inner product:

<alpha|alpha> = |1+i|^2 + |2 - i|^2.

Calculating each modulus squared:

|1+i|^2 = (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2.

Wait, no, wait. The modulus squared of a complex number a + ib is a² + b². So 1+i is 1² + 1² = 2.

Similarly, 2 - i is (2)^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 +1 =5.

So the sum is 2 +5=7. So the normalization factor is sqrt(7). So |alpha> is [ (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

Now, the question is about the operator with matrix elements A_ij. The matrix is given such that A_ij is hbar/2 if i ≠ j, and 0 otherwise. Hmm. So let's think about the matrix dimensions. Since we're dealing with spin-1/2 particles, the spin matrices are 2x2. So the operator A would be a 2x2 matrix.

So for a 2x2 matrix, the elements would be:

A = [ [0, hbar/2],
       [hbar/2, 0] ]

Because when i ≠ j (i=1,j=2 or i=2,j=1), it's hbar/2, else zero.

Wait, wait no. Let me think again. The matrix representation is A_ij = hbar/2 if i≠j, else 0. So for a 2x2 matrix, the diagonal elements (i=j) are zero, and the off-diagonal elements (i≠j) are hbar/2. So the matrix is:

[0   hbar/2
hbar/2  0 ]

So this is the operator. Now, the problem asks to calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of this operator, and also find the average value of that operator.

Wait, but wait. The operator's eigenstates would be its eigenvectors, right? So when we measure an observable, the possible outcomes are its eigenvalues, and the probabilities are the square of the amplitude of the eigenvectors in the state |alpha>.

Wait, but alternatively, the operator in question has a specific form. Let me think about this operator. It's a 2x2 matrix with zeros on the diagonal and hbar/2 elsewhere. Hmm, that looks familiar. Oh wait, this is the Pauli X matrix multiplied by hbar/2. Because the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so if we multiply by hbar/2, we get the matrix A as described.

So the operator is A = (hbar/2) σ_x, where σ_x is the Pauli X matrix.

The eigenvalues of σ_x are +1 and -1. So the eigenvalues of A would be (hbar/2)*1 = hbar/2 and (hbar/2)*(-1) = -hbar/2.

Wait, but no, the eigenvalues of A are those since it's (hbar/2) times σ_x. So the eigenvalues are ±hbar/2.

So the eigenstates are the same as those of σ_x. The eigenstate for +1 is (1/sqrt(2)) |up> + (1/sqrt(2)) |down>, and for -1, it's (1/sqrt(2)) |up> - (1/sqrt(2)) |down>.

Wait, more accurately, the eigenvectors of σ_x are |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and |−x> = (|up> − |down>)/sqrt(2) ). These are the eigenstates for σ_x, with eigenvalues +1 and -1, respectively.

So now, to find the probabilities of measuring each eigenvalue when in state |alpha>, we need to expand |alpha> in terms of these eigenstates.

Alternatively, since |alpha> is expressed in the z-basis, and the operator is in the x-basis, we can compute the inner products between |alpha> and each eigenstate of A.

So the probabilities are given by |<eigenstate | alpha>|^2.

So let's compute these inner products.

First, let me represent |alpha> properly. After normalization, it's [ (1+i)|up> + (2−i)|down> ] / sqrt(7) .

So |alpha> = (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2−i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

The eigenstates of A are |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and |−x> = (|up> − |down>)/sqrt(2).

Let's compute the inner product of |alpha> with |+x>:

<+x| alpha> = [ (1+ i)/sqrt(7) ) * (1/sqrt(2)) ) + ( (2 - i)/sqrt(7) ) * (1/sqrt(2)) ) ]

Wait, because when you take the inner product, you have <+x| alpha> = (1/sqrt(2)) (1|up> + 1|down> ) |alpha> = (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) + (2 - i)/sqrt(7) ) ]

So let's compute:

(1+i) + (2 - i) = (1+2) + (i - i) ) = 3.

So the sum is 3. So the inner product becomes (1/sqrt(2)) * (3 / sqrt(7)) ) = 3/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(7)) ) = 3/(sqrt(14)).

So the probability is |<+x | alpha> |^2 = (9)/(14). Because (3/sqrt(14))² is 9/14.

Wait, that's 9/14 ≈ 0.642857. So approximately 0.64.

Similarly, the inner product with |−x> is:

<−x| alpha> = (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) * 1 + (2 - i)/sqrt(7) * (-1) ) ]

So expanding that:

= (1/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(7))) [ (1+i) - (2 - i) ]

= (1/(sqrt(14))) [ (1+i - 2 + i ) ]

= (1/(sqrt(14))) [ (-1 + 2i ) ]

So the inner product is (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14). The modulus squared is [ (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ] /14 = (1 +4)/14 = 5/14 ≈0.3571.

So the probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14, which are approximately 0.64 and 0.36.

Wait, but wait, 9/14 is about 0.642857, which is about 0.64, and 5/14 is about 0.357, which is 0.36. So that would match option A, which says 0.64, 0.36, and hbar/7 for the average.

But wait, let's also compute the average value of the operator A.

The average value is <alpha| A |alpha> .

Since A is (hbar/2) σ_x, the average would be (hbar/2) <alpha| σ_x |alpha>.

Alternatively, we can compute it directly with the matrix.

But perhaps it's easier to use the expectation value formula.

So let's compute <alpha| A |alpha>.

Since |alpha> is a normalized state, as we've normalized it.

So A is a 2x2 matrix as I wrote before. Let me represent |alpha> as a vector. The state |alpha> is a column vector [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2−i)/sqrt(7) ]^T.

So let me compute A |alpha>:

A = [ [0, hbar/2],
       [hbar/2, 0 ] ]

Multiplying A with the vector:

Top component: 0*(1+i)/sqrt(7) + (hbar/2)* (2 - i)/sqrt(7) ) = (hbar/2)*(2 -i)/sqrt(7)

Bottom component: (hbar/2)*(1 + i)/sqrt(7) + 0*(2 -i)/sqrt(7) ) = (hbar/2)*(1 +i)/sqrt(7)

So A |alpha> = (hbar/(2 sqrt(7))) [ (2 - i), (1 +i) ]^T.

Now, the inner product <alpha| A |alpha> is the conjugate transpose of |alpha> multiplied by A|alpha>.

So |alpha> is [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ]^T.

The conjugate transpose (bra) is [ (1 - i)/sqrt(7), (2 + i)/sqrt(7) ].

So matrix multiplication would be:

[ (1 - i)/sqrt(7), (2 + i)/sqrt(7) ] multiplied by (hbar/(2 sqrt(7))) [ (2 - i), (1 +i) ]

Wait, no. Wait, more accurately:

<alpha| A |alpha> = [ (1 - i)/sqrt(7), (2 + i)/sqrt(7) ] * [ (hbar/(2 sqrt(7)) )*(2 - i), (hbar/(2 sqrt(7)) )*(1 +i) ]

So compute the dot product:

= (1 - i)/sqrt(7) * (hbar/(2 sqrt(7)) (2 - i)) + (2 + i)/sqrt(7) * (hbar/(2 sqrt(7)) (1 + i)) )

Factor out hbar/(2 *7) since sqrt(7)*sqrt(7)=7.

So:

= [ (1 -i)(2 -i) + (2 +i)(1 +i) ] * hbar/(14)

Compute each term:

First term: (1 -i)(2 -i) = 1*2 + 1*(-i) - i*2 + i^2. i^2 is -1.

= 2 -i -2i + (-1) → 2-3i -1 = 1 -3i.

Second term: (2 +i)(1 +i) = 2*1 + 2*i +i*1 +i^2 → 2 +2i +i + (-1) → (2-1) +3i → 1+3i.

So sum of terms: (1-3i) + (1+3i) = 2.

So <alpha| A |alpha> = 2 * hbar/(14 ) = hbar/(7).

So the average value is hbar/7.

Wait, but looking back, the options:

Option A) 0.64,0.36, hbar/7.

Yes, that matches. So the probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14 (≈0.64 and 0.36), and the average is hbar/7.

So the correct answer is option A.

The problem involves an electron in the state |α⟩, which is proportional to (1+i)|up⟩ + (2-i)|down⟩. The first step is to normalize this state. The normalization constant is determined by computing the inner product ⟨α|α⟩, which gives:

\[
\langle \alpha | \alpha \rangle = |1+i|^2 + |2-i|^2 = 2 + 5 = 7.
\]

Thus, the normalized state is:

\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} \left[(1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle\right].
\]

Next, the operator \( A \) is given with matrix elements \( A_{ij} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \) if \( i \neq j \), and \( A_{ij} = 0 \) otherwise. This corresponds to the Pauli \( X \)-matrix scaled by \( \frac{\hbar}{2} \), i.e., \( A = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_x \), where \( \sigma_x \) is the Pauli \( X \)-matrix:

\[
\sigma_x = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvalues of \( \sigma_x \) are \( \pm 1 \), so the eigenvalues of \( A \) are \( \pm \frac{\hbar}{2} \). The eigenstates of \( A \) are the eigenstates of \( \sigma_x \), which are:

\[
|+x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|\uparrow\rangle + |\downarrow\rangle), \quad |-x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|\uparrow\rangle - |\downarrow\rangle).
\]

To find the probabilities of measuring the eigenvalues \( \pm \frac{\hbar}{2} \), we compute the inner products \( \langle +x | \alpha \rangle \) and \( \langle -x | \alpha \rangle \). Substituting \( |\alpha\rangle \) into these expressions:

\[
\langle +x | \alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left[\frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}}\right] = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}},
\]
\[
\langle -x | \alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left[\frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} - \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}}\right] = \frac{-1+2i}{\sqrt{14}}.
\]

The probabilities are the squared magnitudes of these inner products:

\[
P(+\frac{\hbar}{2}) = \left|\langle +x | \alpha \rangle\right|^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.64, \quad P(-\frac{\hbar}{2}) = \left|\langle -x | \alpha \rangle\right|^2 = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.36.
\]

Finally, the average value of \( A \) is computed as \( \langle \alpha | A | \alpha \rangle \). Using the matrix representation of \( A \) and the state \( |\alpha\rangle \), this is calculated as:

\[
\langle \alpha | A | \alpha \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \left[\frac{(1+i)(2-i) + (2-i)(1+i)}{7}\right] = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

Thus, the probabilities are approximately \( 0.64 \) and \( 0.36 \), and the average value is \( \frac{\hbar}{7} \). Comparing with the options, the correct answer is:

**Answer: A**
