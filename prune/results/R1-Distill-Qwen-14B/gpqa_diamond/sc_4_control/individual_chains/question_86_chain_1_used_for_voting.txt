Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question says that a chemist performed two reactions. Each reaction used a different reducing agent on an unknown compound. The products in both cases are enantiomers: one is (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one and the other is (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. I need to figure out what the starting materials A and B were, based on the reducing agents used.

Wait, the products are enantiomers—so if the starting materials are different, the configuration of the product would depend on the starting material's configuration and the reducing agent's action.

Hmm, the reactions are:
A + LiBH4 + H+ → (R)-product
B + BH3 + H+ → (S)-product

Wait, but wait. Are the reducing agents LiBH4 and BH3? Or is it BH3 with something else? Oh, wait, in the question, it's two different reducing agents. So, in the first reaction, the reducing agent is LiBH4, and the second is BH3. Wait, but wait, I think BH3 is usually used as a part of a complex, like BH3-THF, right? Because BH3 is not very soluble. So maybe the second is BH3·THF or another borane.

But how do these reducing agents affect the reaction? Well, I remember that LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent and can reduce ketones to secondary alcohols. But wait, in certain conditions, LiBH4 can also induce some kind of ring-opening if the starting material is an epoxide, but wait, the product here is a cyclic ketone... wait, no, the product is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. So that's a cyclic ether with a ketone group.

Wait no, pyran is a six-membered ring with an oxygen, right? So tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one would be a five-membered ring? No, wait, no. Pyran is a six-membered ring, similar to pyrone. So tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one is a cyclic hemiacetal or something? Or perhaps it's a cyclic ether with a ketone.

Wait, wait. Let me think. The product is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. So the structure would be a six-membered ring where two of the positions are oxygen. Wait, no, the pyran is a oxygen-containing ring with five carbons and one oxygen, making a six-membered ring. So if it's 2H-pyran-2-one, the ketone is at position 2, and the ring is saturated (tetrahydro), so it's a cyclohexane ring with an oxygen and a ketone.

Wait, maybe it's like a cyclic hemiacetal. Hmm, but more likely, it's a cyclic ether with a ketone. So, perhaps the structure is a six-membered ring where the oxygen is at position 1, and the ketone is at position 2, making it a cyclic ketone. But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should draw it.

But maybe the key point is that the product is a ketone. So perhaps the starting material was a ketone as well. Wait, but the starting materials for each reaction are different. Let me think about LiBH4 and BH3 as reducing agents.

Wait, LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, typically used to reduce carbonyl groups to alcohols. So if the product is a ketone, perhaps the starting material was something that upon reduction gives that ketone. But wait, no. Wait, the product is a ketone, but if you use a reducing agent on a carbonyl, you usually get an alcohol. Unless the starting material is something else.

Wait, maybe the starting material is an epoxide? No, because reducing an epoxide with LiBH4 might not give a ketone. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic hemiacetal or acetal.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the starting materials are cyclic acetals or something that upon reduction would form the ketone. Or perhaps the starting materials are ketones themselves but in some protected form.

Wait, maybe the starting materials are epoxides. Another possibility: the products are the result of ring-opening. Wait, but that might not fit.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a reduction of an ester or a ketone. Wait, let's think about the product: 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. Maybe it's formed from a cyclic ketone or from a cyclic hemiacetal.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ether with a ketone group, but that doesn't make sense because the product is a ketone.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a ketone that, upon some reaction, forms the product. But the product is a cyclic ketone. So maybe the starting material is a cyclic hemiacetal or acetal that gets reduced.

Wait, here's another angle. Let's think about the products. The product has two stereocenters: the (R) and (S) configurations. Wait, wait, 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one—let me count the substituents. The numbering is such that the ketone is at position 2, and the ethyl is at position 4. So in the ring, positions 2 (ketone), 4 (ethyl), and the oxygen is probably at position 1 (since pyran is O in position 1). So the ring is O-CH2-CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH2CH3)-CH2-, but I'm not exactly sure. Wait, but perhaps the structure is more like:

O
||
C-CH2-CH2-O-CH2-CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH2CH3)

Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps it's a six-membered ring where position 2 is a carbonyl, position 4 is an ethyl group, and the rest are CH2 groups. So the ring would be:

O
||
C1-O-C2-C3-C4-C5 (with substituents)

Wait, maybe it's better to think about the product as a cyclohexane ring with an oxygen and a ketone group.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a cyclic ketone, so the starting material must have been an acetal or hemiacetal. But I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should think about the reagents and their effects.

LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent. Typically, it reduces esters to alcohols but doesn't stop at ketones; it would reduce a ketone to a secondary alcohol. Wait, but the product is a ketone. So perhaps the reaction isn't a reduction of a carbonyl, but maybe a ring-opening or some other transformation.

Wait, another possibility: the starting material is an epoxide. When you reduce an epoxide with a borane, you can get different products. Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a reduction of a cyclic ether with a ketone group—maybe through some kind of acid-catalyzed ring-opening.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is an acetal. For example, if you have a cyclic acetal, and you treat it with a reducing agent like LiBH4, it might break the acetal and form a carbonyl. But wait, if that's the case, the product would be a carbonyl compound, but in this case, the product is a cyclic ketone. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is an ester. For example, when you reduce an ester with LiBH4, you typically get the corresponding alcohol. But again, that doesn't seem to fit unless the ester was part of a ring.

Wait, maybe the starting materials are cyclic esters, like lactones. Hmm, but how would that work?

Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are cyclic ketals. If you reduce a cyclic ketal, you could get a diol. Wait, but the product is a ketone, so that seems opposite.

Wait, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Let's think about the stereochemistry. The products are enantiomers (R and S configurations). How does the configuration of the starting material affect the product's configuration when reduced?

When you reduce a carbonyl group with a chiral center, the configuration of the starting material would influence the product's configuration. For example, if you have a ketone adjacent to a chiral center, the reduction (if any) would determine the product's stereochemistry. But wait, in this case, the product is a ketone, so perhaps the reduction didn't reduce the ketone but another part of the molecule.

Wait, hold on. Let me think about what LiBH4 and BH3 typically do. LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent. It can reduce esters, amides, ketones, aldehydes, but in some cases, it can also reduce epoxides. Alternatively, BH3 can be used for hydroboration reactions, which are more about addition to alkenes, not reduction of carbonyls.

Wait a minute! Oh wait, I think I've made a mistake. BH3 isn't typically a reducing agent for carbonyls. That's more LiAlH4 and LiBH4. Instead, BH3 is used in hydroboration reactions, where it adds to alkenes in a way that depends on the reaction conditions (like anti-Markovnikov addition).

Wait, but the question says that in reaction B, the reducing agents are BH3 and H+. So perhaps the reaction isn't a reduction of a carbonyl but something else. Oh! So maybe the starting material isn't a carbonyl compound but an epoxide or something else.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe LiBH4 is used to reduce an epoxide to form an alcohol, and BH3 (in hydroboration) is used to add to an alkene.

Wait, but the product is a cyclic ketone. Hmm, this is getting confusing. Let me think differently.

The product is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. So the molecule has a cyclohexane ring with an oxygen, a ketone group at position 2, and an ethyl group at position 4.

So the possible structure is a six-membered ring where positions 1 is oxygen, 2 is a carbonyl group (O=C-), and position 4 is an ethyl group.

Now, how would that form from a starting material via reduction? Perhaps the starting material is an epoxide, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a diethyl acetal or some cyclic hemiacetal that, upon reduction, loses the protecting groups and forms the ketone.

Wait, another approach: Considering the starting materials are options A and B, which are 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, with different configurations. So the structure is pentanoic acid with substituents at position 3 (ethyl) and position 5 (isobutoxy and oxo groups).

Wait, so the starting material is a pentanoic acid derivative. The substituents are at the 3 and 5 positions. Let me try to imagine the structure.

The compound is 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. Pentanoic acid has five carbons, so the structure would be: CH2CH2CH(CH2CH3)-CO-O-iC4H9 (isobutoxy) and a ketone at the same carbon? Wait, no.

Wait, pentanoic acid is CH2CH2CH2CH2COOH. But the substituents are at positions 3 and 5. Wait, wait, let's number the chain. The carboxylic acid is at position 1.

So position 1: COOH

Position 2: CH2

Position 3: CH (with ethyl group)

Position 4: ?

Position 5: ?

Wait, wait, the compound is 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. So, structure would be:

Carboxylic acid group on C1.

C2: CH2

C3: CH(CH2CH2CH3) (since it's 3-ethyl)

C4: ?

C5: has both isobutoxy and oxo groups. Wait, oxo is a ketone, so C5 is a carbonyl.

Wait, but wait, pentanoic acid is five carbons: C1 (COOH), C2, C3, C4, C5 (but wait, that would be C5 as the last carbon, but the carboxylic acid is on C1, so the chain is C1-C2-C3-C4-C5.)

So, for 5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, at C5, you have both isobutoxy and a ketone. Wait, that can't be possible because a carbonyl group is at C5, which is the end of the chain. So, perhaps the structure is:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-CO-O-iC4H9 ?

Wait, but that doesn't seem to fit. Alternatively, maybe the structure is:

Carboxylic acid (C1), then C2-CH2, C3-CH(CH2CH2CH3), C5 has both an isobutoxy group and a ketone. Hmm, perhaps the structure is:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-CO-O-(CH(CH2CH3)2) ?

Wait, that doesn't quite make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are on the same carbon, C5, but that's the last carbon.

Wait, but how can a carbon have both an isobutoxy group and a ketone? That would require the carbon to have a double bond, but that's not possible. So maybe I'm getting the structure wrong.

Wait, perhaps it's 5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. So, on C5, there's a carbonyl group and an isobutoxy group.

So, the structure would be:

C1: COOH

C2: CH2

C3: CH(CH2CH2CH3)

C4: CH2

C5: O=C-O-iC4H9

Wait, but that would make the structure something like:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-CH2-CO-O-iC4H9 ?

But that would be a six-carbon chain, not five. Wait, no, maybe it's:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-C(O-O-iC4H9)=O ?

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-CH2-CO-O-iC4H9

Wait, but that's five carbons in the chain, with substituents on C3 and C5.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are on C5, which is part of a ring structure. Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but regardless of the structure, the key point is that the starting material is a pentanoic acid derivative with substituents at C3 and C5. Then, when treated with reducing agents LiBH4 and BH3, it forms the product.

Wait, but how does a pentanoic acid derivative become a six-membered cyclic ketone upon reduction? Maybe the reduction breaks some bonds and forms a ring.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is an acetal or ketal. So, when you reduce it, the acetal breaks to form a ketone. But I'm not entirely clear on that.

Wait, let me think about LiBH4 and BH3 again. LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent and can reduce esters, ketones, etc. BH3, on the other hand, is more commonly used in hydroboration reactions, which add to alkenes. So, if the starting material has an alkene, BH3 would add across it.

Wait, but in this case, the product is a ketone. So perhaps the starting material is an epoxide. When LiBH4 is used to reduce an epoxide, it can open the ring to form an alcohol. But the product is a ketone, so that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, if the starting material is a cyclic ester (lactone), then treatment with a reducing agent like LiBH4 would reduce the ester to a diol. But again, the product is a ketone, so that doesn't fit.

Hmm. Maybe I should think about the stereochemistry. The products are enantiomers, meaning that the starting materials must have opposite configurations to produce opposite configurations in the product.

So, in each reaction, the starting material (A or B) is treated with a different reducing agent (LiBH4 or BH3), and the product's configuration depends on both the starting material's configuration and the reducing agent's action.

Wait, what determines the configuration of the product in a reduction? For example, in the reduction of a ketone to an alcohol, the boron from BH3 adds to the less substituted side (anti-Markovnikov). But if the ketone is chiral, the configuration of the starting material would influence where the boron adds.

Wait, but wait, LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent and reduces ketones to secondary alcohols. The stereochemistry of the resulting alcohol depends on the structure of the starting ketone. If the ketone has a chiral center adjacent to the carbonyl, the reduction can lead to retention or inversion of configuration.

Wait, but in this scenario, the product is a ketone, not an alcohol. So perhaps the reaction isn't a reduction of a ketone but something else.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a hemiacetal or acetal. Let's say the starting material is a cyclic acetal. When treated with a reducing agent like LiBH4, it would break the acetal and form a carbonyl group, which would be a ketone. So the product would be a ketone.

So let's imagine that the starting material is a cyclic acetal. When LiBH4 is used, it would reduce the acetal by breaking the oxygen ring and forming a ketone.

But wait, cyclic acetals are typically stable under basic conditions but can be cleaved under acidic conditions. LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent and is usually used in aprotic solvents with acids, like in the presence of H+.

Wait, so if the starting material is a cyclic acetal (like a five-membered ring), and LiBH4 is added, perhaps it would break the acetal and form a ketone.

Similarly, BH3 might do something else. Wait, but BH3 is more about hydroboration. Alternatively, perhaps BH3 is used in a different way, like in the reduction of an ester or another functional group.

Wait, but the product is a ketone, so perhaps the starting material has an ester group which upon reduction becomes a ketone. Wait, no. Esters upon reduction typically form alcohols.

Alternatively, maybe the starting material is an ester that, when reduced with LiBH4, becomes a ketone. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ester (lactone). If you reduce a lactone with LiBH4, you would break the ester into a diol. But that would give an alcohol, not a ketone.

Hmm, this is getting a bit tangled. Maybe I should approach it from the options given.

Looking at the options:

A) A and B are both (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.

B) Both (R)-...

C) A is (S), B is (R)

D) A is (R), B is (S)

So, the starting materials are either both R, both S, or one R and one S.

But how does the configuration affect the product when reduced?

Wait, another thought: Maybe the starting materials are esters, and the reduction leads to the formation of a secondary alcohol. But the product is a ketone, which doesn't match. So maybe the starting material is an ester, and the reduction doesn't go all the way, but that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the reaction isn't a reduction but a hydrolysis. But the question says it's a reduction reaction.

Wait, another angle: The product is a cyclic ketone with a specific configuration (R or S). The starting material must have a configuration that upon reduction leads to that product.

But I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think about the reagents and their effect on the stereochemistry.

LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent and typically does not change the configuration of adjacent stereocenters. Wait, but in a ketone reduction, the new stereocenter is created. For example, if you reduce a prochiral ketone, you get an alcohol with a specific configuration.

Wait, but the product is a ketone, not an alcohol. So maybe the starting material is a compound with a protecting group that, upon reduction, forms the ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is an ester that, when reduced, forms a ketone.

Wait, another thought: LiBH4 can reduce esters to alcohols, but if the ester is part of a cyclic structure, maybe the ring opens upon reduction, forming a ketone.

But I'm not entirely certain. Let's try to think about the options. The starting materials are 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid with either R or S configuration.

Wait, the starting material is a pentanoic acid with substituents at positions 3 (ethyl) and 5 (isobutoxy and oxo groups). So the structure must have a substituent at 5 that is both an isobutoxy group and a ketone group.

Wait, that can't be possible unless it's a cyclic structure. So maybe the starting material is a cyclic ketone with an ester group or something similar.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a β-keto ester. For instance, something like CH2-CO-O-R, which upon reduction would form an alcohol.

Wait, but I'm not making progress. Let me think about what the product looks like.

The product is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. So, it's a six-membered ring with an oxygen, a ketone at position 2, and an ethyl group at position 4.

I think the starting material is a cyclic acetal. When LiBH4 is added, it would break the acetal and form a ketone. So the starting material would have a ring structure with an acetal group, which, upon reduction, would form the ketone.

But the starting materials given in the options are pentanoic acids. So perhaps the pentanoic acid is part of a cyclic structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a β-keto acid, which upon reduction would form a β-hydroxy acid, which could cyclize to form a cyclic ketone.

Wait, let me think again. If the starting material is 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, perhaps upon treatment with a reducing agent, the ester group (if any) is reduced, leading to the formation of a ring.

Wait, but the starting material is a pentanoic acid, so maybe it's an ester. Alternatively, perhaps the compound has an ester group elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps the compound is an ester, and upon reduction, the ester is cleaved, releasing an acid and an alcohol, but that doesn't directly lead to a cyclic ketone.

Alternatively, maybe the ester is part of a ring. So when the ester is reduced, the ring opens, and a new ring forms.

Wait, perhaps it's a cyclic ester (lactone). When you reduce a lactone, you get a diol. But the product is a ketone, so that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is an α-keto ester. When reduced, the ester part could become an alcohol, and the ketone becomes something else.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck here. Let's think about the stereochemistry again. The product has (R) and (S) configurations. The starting materials are either R or S, and each is treated with a different reagent.

LiBH4 and BH3 are different in their reaction mechanisms. LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, while BH3 is typically used for hydroboration, which is a two-step process: addition of BH3 followed by oxidation.

Wait, but in the second reaction, the reducing agent is BH3 and H+. So perhaps it's a hydroboration reaction.

Wait, if the starting material has a double bond, then BH3 would add to the double bond in a anti-Markovnikov fashion, forming an alcohol with a specific configuration.

But the product is a cyclic ketone, not an alcohol. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the starting material is a cyclic ether with a ketone group, and the reducing agents are opening the ether. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ester or lactone, and the reduction breaks the ester to form a diol, which then cyclizes to form a ketone. But I'm not certain about that.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a β-keto ester. For example, if the starting material is a β-keto ester, then reduction with LiBH4 would reduce the ester to an alcohol, but if the reaction is incomplete, perhaps the β-keto group remains, leading to a cyclic structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic β-keto ester. When LiBH4 reduces the ester part, it could open the ring and form a ketone.

Wait, but I'm not getting anywhere. Maybe I should think about the two possibilities:

When the starting material is treated with LiBH4, it forms the (R) product.

When it's treated with BH3, it forms the (S) product.

So, the same starting material, when treated with different reducing agents, gives different configurations. But in the options, the starting materials for A and B are different. So, the starting materials must be enantiomers, perhaps.

Wait, because if the starting materials are enantiomers, and the reagents produce products with opposite configurations, then perhaps the reagents cause the product's configuration to flip.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the reagents could influence the facial selectivity of the reduction, leading to different configurations.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic hemiacetal. When treated with a reducing agent, the acetal is cleaved, and the ketone is formed. The configuration of the starting material would influence where the reduction occurs, leading to R or S configuration.

But without knowing the exact structure of the starting material, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a ketone with a chiral center. When reduced, the borane would add in a certain way, leading to the product's configuration.

Wait, but the product is a ketone, not an alcohol, so that's not it.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Let me try to think about the options. The options are about whether A and B are R or S.

If the starting material is R, and treated with LiBH4 gives R product, and S starting material with BH3 gives S product, or something like that.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a reduction of a ketone, and the configuration of the starting material is retained in the product. So, if the starting material is R, and the reducing agent doesn't change the configuration, the product would be R. But if the starting material is S, the product would be S.

But the problem is that the products are enantiomers, so they must have opposite configurations. So, if reaction A produces R, then reaction B must have started with the opposite configuration.

Wait, but the options are about A and B being R or S. So, for reaction A, which uses LiBH4, the product is R. For reaction B, which uses BH3, the product is S.

So, perhaps the starting material for reaction A is R, and the starting material for reaction B is S.

Wait, but the options only give combinations where A and B are the same or opposite.

Looking at the options:

Option C: A is S, B is R.

Option D: A is R, B is S.

So, if the starting material A is S and gives the R product, and starting material B is R and gives S product, then that would make sense if the reagents cause inversion.

Wait, but why would LiBH4 cause inversion and BH3 cause retention? I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reagents influence the configuration. For example, LiBH4 may reduce from one face, leading to R, while BH3 (with different conditions) leads to S.

Alternatively, perhaps the configuration of the starting material is such that when reduced with LiBH4, it forms R, and when reduced with BH3, it forms S.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a β-keto ester, and the position of the substituents determines the configuration of the product.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material has a neighboring group that directs the reduction.

Wait, but I'm not getting anywhere with this. Let me think about the options.

The correct answer is either option C or D, where A and B are opposite configurations. Because the products are opposite.

So, options C and D are the only ones where A and B are different.

Between C and D, the question is whether A is S and B is R (option C) or A is R and B is S (option D).

Now, the reagents are LiBH4 and BH3. How do they affect the configuration?

Wait, perhaps LiBH4 leads to the same configuration as the starting material, while BH3 leads to the opposite. Or vice versa.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Another approach: think about the reaction conditions.

LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent and typically leads to anti addition in some reductions. BH3, in hydroboration, leads to anti-Markovnikov addition but the stereochemistry depends on the conditions.

Wait, another thought: when reducing a ketone with LiBH4, the configuration of the starting material (if any) would influence the product's configuration. But since the product is a ketone, perhaps the reduction is of an ester or another group.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is an epoxide. When reduced with LiBH4, the epoxide would open to form a diol with a certain configuration. But the product is a ketone, so that's not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a β-keto ester. When reduced, the ester becomes an alcohol, and the β-keto group remains, allowing for cyclization to form a cyclic ketone.

So, if the starting material is a β-keto ester, say, something like CH2-CO-O-R-CH2-CH2-CO-R', upon reduction, the ester part becomes a CH2-OH group, and the β-keto group could cyclize to form a ring.

Wait, but then the product would have a ring structure with an alcohol and a ketone. But the product here is a cyclic ketone without an alcohol.

Hmm. I'm getting stuck, so maybe I should consider the answer options.

Since the products are enantiomers, the starting materials must be enantiomers as well, depending on the reagents.

If the reagents cause the product to have the opposite configuration of the starting material, then the starting materials would need to be enantiomers to produce the two enantiomeric products.

But the options don't have A and B as enantiomers. Wait, wait, looking back, the options are:

Option C: A is (S), B is (R)

Option D: A is (R), B is (S)

So, perhaps the correct answer is option D, where A is R and B is S, leading to the products R and S.

But why would that be the case? Because reaction A uses LiBH4, reaction B uses BH3.

If the configuration of the product depends on the configuration of the starting material and the reagent, perhaps LiBH4 causes the starting material's configuration to become R, and BH3 causes it to become S.

Alternatively, perhaps LiBH4 leads to retention, and BH3 leads to inversion.

Wait, but without knowing the exact mechanism, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reducing agents cause the starting material to lose a protecting group, thereby determining the configuration.

Wait, another thought: the starting material is a β-keto ester. Upon reduction, the ester is converted to an alcohol, and the β-keto group allows for cyclization to form a cyclic ketone. The configuration during cyclization would depend on the starting material's configuration.

So, if the starting material has an S configuration, the ring would form with R configuration, and vice versa.

But I'm not entirely certain about that.

In the end, I'm torn between options C and D. Since the products are enantiomers, the starting materials must be opposite. Looking at the options, option D has A as R and B as S, which would produce R and S products, respectively. So, the correct answer would be option D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves determining the starting materials for two reactions that yield enantiomeric products: (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. The reactions use two different reducing agents: LiBH4 and BH3. The starting materials are given as 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, which can exist as either the (R) or (S) configuration.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Reagents and Products**:
   - LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, typically used to reduce esters, ketones, and other carbonyl-containing compounds.
   - BH3 is commonly used in hydroboration reactions, which add boron to alkenes in an anti-Markovnikov fashion.
   - The products are enantiomers, meaning their configurations are opposite (R and S).

2. **Starting Materials**:
   - The starting materials are 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, which can exist as either the (R) or (S) configuration.
   - The stereochemistry of the starting material and the reducing agent influence the configuration of the product.

3. **Reaction Outcomes**:
   - Reaction A (LiBH4) produces the (R)-enantiomer.
   - Reaction B (BH3) produces the (S)-enantiomer.
   - Since the products are enantiomers, the starting materials must have opposite configurations to yield the observed stereochemical outcomes.

4. **Options**:
   - **Option A**: Both starting materials are (S). This would not produce enantiomeric products.
   - **Option B**: Both starting materials are (R). This would also not produce enantiomeric products.
   - **Option C**: A is (S), B is (R). This setup could produce enantiomeric products.
   - **Option D**: A is (R), B is (S). This setup could also produce enantiomeric products.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The correct answer must reflect that the starting materials are enantiomers to yield the enantiomeric products.
