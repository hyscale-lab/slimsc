Okay, so I have this question about stars and which ones can be detected by two specific spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, I remember that these instruments have different capabilities in terms of the brightness of stars they can observe.

The question gives me five stars, each with different properties. The key thing is to figure out the apparent V magnitude of each star because that's what determines if they can be observed by ESPRESSO and HIRES.

Let me first recall the facts. ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. Wait, no wait, the question says "brighter than 17 mag", but wait, higher magnitudes mean fainter objects. So, the brighter the star (lower magnitude), the easier it is to detect. Oh wait, no, wait. Magnitude scale is such that lower numbers are brighter. So if a telescope can observe stars brighter than a certain magnitude, that's the same as saying stars with magnitudes lower than that. Because a star with V=10 is brighter than V=15.

Wait, the question says: "with ESPRESSO, stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed". Wait, no, that can't be right. Because higher magnitudes are fainter. Oh wait, wait, maybe it's the opposite. Let me think. The statement says: "brighter than 17 mag." So a star that is brighter than 17 mag would have a lower apparent magnitude. So, for example, a 16th magnitude star is brighter than 17. So ESPRESSO can observe stars with apparent V mag up to 17 (which is fainter), but wait, no—wait, the way it's phrased is: "brighter than 17 mag", meaning their apparent V magnitude is less than 17. Because brighter stars have lower magnitudes.

Wait, no, I think I need to clarify. The question says "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed." So a star that is brighter than 17 mag (i.e., apparent magnitude less than 17) can be observed by ESPRESSO. So the maximum apparent magnitude that ESPRESSO can handle is 17. Similarly, for HIRES, it's stars brighter than 16 mag, meaning apparent magnitude less than 16, because those are the brighter stars.

So for each star, I need to calculate their apparent V magnitude and see if it's ≤ 17 (for ESPRESSO) and ≤16 (for HIRES). Wait, no: wait, the question says, which stars can be detected by both. So a star must have apparent V magnitude ≤17 (so ESPRESSO can see it) AND apparent V mag ≤16 (so HIRES can see it). Because both need to observe it. So the star's apparent V must be ≤16, because that's the stricter condition.

So the stars that have apparent V magnitude ≤16 can be detected by both spectrographs. Wait, but wait: looking back, for HIRES, it's stars brighter than 16 (so apparent V mag <16, since brighter than 16). So for a star to be detected by both, its apparent V mag must be ≤16.

Wait, that seems correct. So let's look at each star and compute their apparent V magnitude.

Wait, but some stars have absolute magnitudes given, others have apparent magnitudes. I need to compute the apparent magnitude for the ones that have absolute magnitude. Oh, right, the formula for apparent magnitude is m = M + 5 + 5 log10(d / 10), where M is absolute magnitude, d is distance in parsecs. Or wait, the formula is m = M + 5 log10(d) -5. Because M is the apparent magnitude at 10 parsecs, so for a star at d parsecs, the formula is m = M + 5 log10(d) -5.

Wait, yes, correct. So for stars where M is given and d is given, I need to calculate m.

But some stars have apparent magnitude given, so for those, I can directly use their m.

Let me go through each star:

Star1: absolute V mag is 15.5, distance 10 pc.

Compute m = 15.5 + 5 log10(10) -5.

Log10(10) = 1, so 5*1=5. So m = 15.5 +5 -5 = 15.5. So m=15.5.

Star2: apparent V mag is 16.5.

So m =16.5. That's what it is.

Star3: apparent V mag is 15.5, but there's extinction. E(B-V)=0.6 mag. The note says that total absorption in V is 3.1 times E(B-V). So extinction in V is A_V = 3.1 * E(B-V) = 3.1 *0.6 = 1.86 mag.

So the apparent magnitude is m_observed = m_true + A_V. Wait, wait, no: when extinction is present, the observed magnitude is brighter or fainter? Wait, extinction makes stars appear fainter (higher magnitude) because it's absorbing light. So the true apparent magnitude without extinction is m_true, and the observed magnitude m_observed = m_true + A_V.

Wait no, wait. Wait, the star's light is dimmed by extinction, so the star appears fainter. So if a star has an extinction of A_V, its observed magnitude is m_obs = m_true + A_V.

So for Star3: apparent V mag is 15.5, but E(B-V)=0.6. So A_V=1.86. So m_observed =15.5 +1.86=17.36 mag.

Wait, but wait, wait a moment. Oh, no. Wait, the problem statement says that Star3's apparent V magnitude is 15.5, but that's without considering extinction? Or is that the observed apparent magnitude? Hmm, the question says, for Star3, "apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag, E(B-V) = 0.6 mag".

Ah, I think that the given apparent magnitude is the observed one, which already includes extinction. No, wait, no. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Wait, when stars emit light, the dust in the interstellar medium scatters and absorbs some of it, making them appear dimmer (higher magnitude). So the observed apparent magnitude is the true magnitude plus the extinction (A_V). So if a star's actual apparent magnitude (without extinction) is m, the observed would be m + A_V.

But in the problem, I think Star3's apparent V magnitude is given as 15.5, which is the observed magnitude (so it's already including extinction). Or is it the intrinsic magnitude?

Wait, the problem says: "apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag and located at 15 pc distance from us. Note that the total absorption in the V band is related to the color excess in B-V with a coefficient equal to 3.1."

Wait, no. The total absorption is the extinction A_V. So perhaps the apparent magnitude given is the intrinsic one without extinction, and we have to correct for extinction to get the observed apparent magnitude?

Wait, that's a bit ambiguous. Let me re-read the problem statement.

For Star3, the question says: "apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag, E(B-V) = 0.6 mag and located at 15 pc distance from us."

Wait, no, I think that Star3's apparent magnitude is given as 15.5, but that's without considering the extinction. So to get the observed apparent magnitude, we have to add the extinction (A_V) to it.

Wait, but in reality, the extinction affects the observed magnitude. So if a star has an intrinsic apparent magnitude m, the observed is m + A_V.

So for Star3: true apparent magnitude is 15.5, E(B-V)=0.6, so A_V = 3.1*0.6=1.86. So observed m is 15.5 +1.86 =17.36 mag. So the star's apparent magnitude is 17.36.

But wait, wait. Let me think again. The way the problem is phrased: "apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag, E(B-V) = 0.6 mag".

Wait, perhaps the 15.5 is the apparent magnitude after correction for extinction. Because, in astronomy, when you measure a star's apparent magnitude, it's usually the observed value, which includes extinction. But sometimes, people correct for extinction to find the intrinsic magnitude.

Alternatively, maybe the given apparent magnitude is what is measured, and the extinction is extra. Hmm, this is a bit tricky.

Wait, the problem says: "Note that the total absorption in the V band is related to the color excess in B-V with a coefficient equal to 3.1."

So the absorption is A_V = 3.1 * E(B-V). So for Star3, E(B-V)=0.6 → A_V=1.86.

So Star3 has an apparent V magnitude of 15.5, but that's before considering absorption? Or after?

Wait, the way the question is phrased, I think that the apparent magnitude given is the observed (i.e., including extinction), so we don't need to adjust it. Or perhaps the opposite.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think: if a star is behind a lot of dust, its observed apparent magnitude is higher (fainter) than its actual. So if the star's true apparent magnitude (without extinction) is 15.5, but due to extinction, its observed apparent magnitude is 15.5 +1.86 =17.36.

But the problem states: "apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag" — which is the observed value. So E(B-V) is 0.6, so A_V is 1.86. So if the observed m is 15.5, then the true m would be 15.5 -1.86 =13.64. Hmm, but that's not necessarily needed unless the question is about absolute magnitude.

Wait, no, in this problem, we need the apparent V magnitude (the observed one) to decide if it's within the detection limits. So the observed m is 15.5 +1.86? Or is the 15.5 the observed m, so no need to adjust.

Wait, I think the problem is that the given m is the observed (already with extinction), so we don't need to adjust. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the 15.5 is the intrinsic, and we have to add the extinction to get the observed. Hmm.

This is a potential confusion point. Let me see the problem again. The problem says, for Star3: "apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag and located at 15 pc distance from us. Note that the total absorption in the V band is related to the color excess in B-V with a coefficient equal to 3.1."

Ah, wait, maybe the 15.5 is the apparent magnitude as observed, so including the extinction. So if the star's actual brightness is m_true, then m_observed = m_true + A_V. So if the problem gives m_observed as 15.5, then m_true = 15.5 - A_V =15.5-1.86=13.64. But why would that matter? Because in the context of the problem, the question is about the apparent magnitude as observed. So perhaps I should take the given m as the observed, which includes extinction.

Wait, but in that case, Star3's apparent V magnitude is 15.5, which is below the ESPRESSO limit of 17, but above HIRES's limit of 16. So HIRES can't see it (since 15.5 is less than 16? Wait, wait.

Wait, let me clarify:

HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag. So any star with apparent V mag ≤16 (brighter) can be observed by HIRES.

Wait, no. Because if a star has m=15, that's brighter than 16. So yes, HIRES can see it. So a star with m=15.5 is brighter than 16, so yes.

Wait, no, because m=15 is brighter than m=16. So if a star has m=15.5, that's 15.5 <16, so it's brighter than 16, so HIRES can observe it.

Wait no, wait. Let me think again about the magnitudes. The scale is such that lower magnitudes are brighter. So m=15 is brighter than m=16, which is brighter than m=17. So a star with m=15.5 is brighter than m=16, so HIRES (which can observe stars brighter than 16) can see it.

Wait, but the question says, for HIRES, stars with apparent V mag brighter than 16 can be observed. So m <16.

So for Star3, m=15.5 → yes, it's brighter than 16? No, wait, m=15.5 is less than 16, so it's brighter. So yes, it's brighter than 16, so HIRES can observe it.

Wait, but Star3's m is 15.5. So it's within the HIRES detection limit.

Wait, but wait, the problem says: with HIRES, stars with apparent V mag brighter than 16 can be observed. So any star with m ≤16 can be detected. Because 16 is the limit.

Wait, no, because "brighter than 16" implies m<16.

Hmm, this is a point of confusion. Let me clarify:

Magnitude scale: lower number means brighter. So, a star with m=15 is brighter than m=16. So if the instrument can observe stars brighter than 16, that would mean m <16, because 15 is brighter than 16.

So for Star3, m=15.5 <16 → yes, it can be observed by HIRES.

But wait, the observed m is 15.5. So both ESPRESSO and HIRES can observe it. Because ESPRESSO's limit is 17, which is higher (fainter) than 16.

Wait, no. Because for ESPRESSO, stars with m <17 can be observed. Since 15.5 <17, yes.

So Star3 can be observed by both? Or wait, no: wait, if Star3's apparent V mag is 15.5, then it's within both's detection limits.

Wait, but wait, the problem says Star3's m is 15.5, with E(B-V)=0.6. So I thought that the 15.5 is the observed m, but if the extinction is 1.86, then the actual m is 15.5 -1.86=13.64. But wait, that's not correct because extinction makes stars appear dimmer, so if a star's true m is 13.64, the observed m is 15.5.

Wait, no, extinction (A_V) is added to the apparent magnitude. So the observed m is m_true + A_V.

If the observed m is 15.5, which already includes A_V, then the true (intrinsic) m is 15.5 - A_V =15.5 -1.86=13.64.

But wait, that's perhaps overcomplicating. Because the question is about the apparent V magnitude, which is what the instrument observes. So for Star3, the apparent V is 15.5, which is brighter than 16, so HIRES can see it, and since it's also brighter than 17, ESPRESSO can see it. So Star3 is detectable by both.

Wait, but wait, let me make sure. Star3's apparent V is 15.5. ESPRESSO can observe up to 17. So yes. HIRES can observe up to 16. So 15.5 is within its limit. So yes, Star3 is observable by both.

Moving on to Star4: absolute V mag is 15.5, located at 10 pc.

Compute m = M +5 log10(d) -5.

d=10 → log10(10)=1 → 5*1=5.

m =15.5 +5 -5 =15.5.

Star4's m is 15.5.

E(B-V)=0.4 → A_V=3.1 *0.4=1.24. So the observed m is 15.5 +1.24=16.74.

Wait, no, wait: this depends on whether the given m is the intrinsic or observed.

Wait, the question states: Star4 has absolute V magnitude 15.5, E(B-V)=0.4. It's located at 10 pc. So to compute its apparent magnitude, we can use m = M +5 log10(d) -5.

d=10 → m=15.5 +5*(1) -5 =15.5.

So m without extinction is 15.5. But since E(B-V)=0.4, A_V=1.24. So the observed m is 15.5 +1.24=16.74.

So the apparent V magnitude of Star4 is 16.74. So for detection:

HIRES can detect m <16 → 16.74>16 → no, so HIRES can't observe.

ESPRESSO can detect m <17 → 16.74 <17 → yes.

So Star4 can only be detected by ESPRESSO, not HIRES.

Star5: absolute V mag 16.5, distance 5 pc.

Compute m =16.5 +5 log10(5) -5.

Log10(5) is about 0.69897.

5 * 0.69897 ≈3.495.

So m=16.5 +3.495 -5 =16.5 + (-1.505) =14.995 ≈15.0 mag.

So apparent V mag is ~15.0.

E(B-V) is not given, so I assume there's no extinction (since Star5's description doesn't mention it), so A_V=0.

So observed m is 15.0.

So for detection:

HIRES can observe m <16 → 15 <16 → yes.

ESPRESSO can observe m <17 → yes.

So Star5 can be detected by both.

Wait, but wait, Star5's m is 15.0, which is below both 16 and 17.

So now, let's list each star's apparent V mag:

Star1: m=15.5 → detected by both.

Star2: m=16.5 → detected by ESPRESSO (16.5 <17) but not HIRES (16.5 >16).

Star3: m=15.5 → detected by both.

Star4: m=16.74 → detected by ESPRESSO, not HIRES.

Star5: m=15.0 → detected by both.

Wait, but wait, I thought Star3's m was 15.5, which is observed. So it's within both's detection limits.

Wait, but earlier when considering Star3, I thought that it's m is 15.5 (without extinction), but I'm not sure. Let me double-check.

Wait, in the case of Star3, the problem says: apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag, E(B-V)=0.6.

I think the way the problem is phrased, the 15.5 is the apparent magnitude without considering extinction. So the observed m is 15.5 + A_V.

A_V=3.1 *0.6=1.86 → m_obs=15.5+1.86=17.36.

If that's the case, then Star3's observed m is 17.36.

So for detection:

HIRES requires m <16 → 17.36>16 → no.

ESPRESSO requires m <17 → 17.36 >17 → no.

So Star3's observed m is 17.36, which is above both instruments' limits. So neither can detect it.

Wait, this is conflicting with my earlier analysis. So I must decide whether the given apparent magnitude includes extinction or not.

The problem statement for Star3 says: "apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag, E(B-V) = 0.6 mag and located at 15 pc distance from us."

Hmm, so if the apparent magnitude is already the observed one (including extinction), then we don't need to adjust it. So Star3's m=15.5. So it's detected by both.

But if the apparent magnitude is the intrinsic (without extinction), then we have to add A_V to get the observed m. So in that case, m_obs=15.5 +1.86=17.36, which is too faint for both.

This is a crucial point. How to interpret the given data?

In astronomy, when the problem gives the apparent magnitude, it's usually the observed (corrected for extinction) unless stated otherwise. So if the problem gives Star3's apparent V mag as 15.5 and E(B-V)=0.6, perhaps the 15.5 is the observed m, so we don't need to add A_V again. Hmm, but that's not the case. Because E(B-V) is the color excess, which is used to calculate A_V, which in turn is the extinction in V.

I think that in this problem, the given apparent magnitude for Star3 is the true (intrinsic) magnitude without extinction. So to get the observed, we have to add the A_V.

So for Star3:

m_true =15.5.

A_V=1.86.

m_observed =15.5 +1.86 =17.36.

So Star3's apparent magnitude is 17.36, which is above both ESPRESSO (17) and HIRES (16) limits. So neither can detect it.

Similarly, let's reevaluate all stars.

Star1: m=15.5, no extinction. So m_obs=15.5.

Star2: m=16.5, no extinction. So m_obs=16.5.

Star3: m_true=15.5, A_V=1.86 → m_obs=17.36.

Star4: m=15.5, E(B-V)=0.4 → A_V=1.24 → m_obs=15.5 +1.24=16.74.

Star5: m=15.0, no extinction → m_obs=15.0.

Wait, no. Wait, Star5's m is computed as 15.0. So apparent V mag is 15.0.

Now, let's reevaluate each star's detectability.

Star1: m=15.5.

HIRES can observe m <16 → 15.5<16 → yes.

ESPRESSO can observe m <17 → yes.

So Star1 is detectable by both.

Star2: m=16.5.

HIRES can't (16.5>16). ESPRESSO can (16.5<17). So only ESPRESSO can detect.

Star3: m_obs=17.36 → both can't detect.

Star4: m_obs=16.74 → ESPRESSO can (16.74<17), HIRES can't (16.74>16).

Star5: m=15.0 → both can detect.

So which stars can be detected by both?

Star1 and Star5.

Wait, but let's see:

Star1: m=15.5 → both can detect.

Star5: m=15.0 → both can detect.

So looking at the options:

Option D is Star1 and Star4.

Option B is Star3 and Star5.

Option A is Star4 and Star5.

Option C is Star2 and Star3.

So none of these options include Star1 and Star5.

Wait, but according to my analysis, Star1 and Star5 are both detectable by both instruments.

Looking back at the options:

Options:

A) Star4 and Star5 → Star4's m_obs=16.74, so HIRES can't detect. So A is incorrect.

B) Star3 and Star5 → Star3's m_obs=17.36, can't detect. So B is incorrect.

C) Star2 and Star3 → Star2's m=16.5, HIRES can't. Star3 can't either. So C is incorrect.

D) Star1 and Star4 → Star4's m=16.74. HIRES can't. So D is incorrect.

Wait, but wait, in my analysis, Star1 and Star5 are both detectable by both instruments. But looking at the options, none of them include both. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, wait, perhaps I miscalculated Star5's m.

Star5: absolute V=16.5, distance=5 pc.

m = M +5 log10(d) -5.

d=5 → log10(5)=0.69897.

5 * 0.69897 ≈3.49485.

m=16.5 +3.49485 -5 → 16.5 + (-1.50515) → 14.99485 → ~15.0.

So Star5's m=15.0, which is observed (no extinction given). So m=15.0. So both can detect.

So which options include Star1 and Star5?

Looking again:

Options:

A) 4 and 5 → Star4's m=16.74, so HIRES can't. So A is not correct.

B) 3 and5 → Star3's m=17.36, can't be detected.

C) 2 and3 → Star2's m=16.5 (can't by HIRES), Star3 can't.

D) 1 and4 → Star4's m=16.74, HIRES can't.

Wait, but according to the options, perhaps I'm missing a step.

Wait, another approach: which options have stars that have m_obs ≤16 (so both can detect).

Star1: m=15.5 → yes.

Star5: m=15.0 → yes.

So the correct stars are Star1 and Star5.

Looking at the options, which option includes both?

Option D: Star1 and Star4 → Star4's m=16.74 → no.

Other options don't have Star1 and Star5 together.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting Star3's m.

Alternative approach: maybe in the problem, Star3's apparent V is given as the observed (including extinction), so we don't add anything.

If that's the case:

Star3's m=15.5 → both can detect.

So which options include Star3 and another star that can be detected by both.

Star5 is 15.0 → both can detect.

So option B: Star3 and Star5 → both can be detected by both.

But wait, no, because if Star3's m is 15.5, then both can detect.

But Star5's m is 15.0, so both can detect.

So option B includes Star3 and Star5.

But wait, the problem says Star3's m is 15.5, and Star5's is 15.0.

So both can be detected by both instruments.

So the correct answer would be option B: Star3 and Star5.

But earlier I thought that Star3's m is 17.36 if we include extinction, but perhaps the problem assumes that the given m is the observed, so no extinction needs to be added.

In that case, Star3's m=15.5 → both can detect.

Star5's m=15.0 → both can detect.

So the pair would be Star3 and Star5, which is option B.

Hmm.

But wait, the problem states: for Star3, "E(B-V)=0.6 mag and located at 15 pc distance from us. Note that the total absorption in the V band is related to the color excess in B-V with a coefficient equal to 3.1."

Wait, so the note says that A_V =3.1 * E(B-V).

So the extinction is 1.86 mag.

So if the given apparent magnitude is the true m (without extinction), then the observed m is m + A_V.

But if the given m is the observed (including extinction), then we don't have to adjust.

But how to know which it is.

In astronomy, the "apparent magnitude" usually refers to the observed magnitude. So Star3's m=15.5 is what is observed, which includes the extinction. So in that case, we don't add anything.

So Star3's m=15.5 → both can detect.

Star5's m=15.0 → both can detect.

So the correct answer would be that both Star3 and Star5 can be detected by both spectrographs.

Looking at the options:

Option B: Star3 and Star5.

So that's the correct answer.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal and the HIRES spectrograph at Keck, we analyze the apparent V magnitudes of the stars. The detection limits are as follows:

- **ESPRESSO**: Stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag (i.e., $m < 17$).
- **HIRES**: Stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 16 mag (i.e., $m < 16$).

For a star to be detectable by both spectrographs, its apparent V magnitude must satisfy $m < 16$. We calculate or use the given apparent V magnitudes for each star, accounting for extinction where necessary.

### Analysis of Each Star:

1. **Star1**:  
   - Absolute V magnitude $M = 15.5$, distance $d = 10$ pc.  
   - Apparent V magnitude:  
     \[
     m = M + 5 \log_{10}(d) - 5 = 15.5 + 5 \cdot \log_{10}(10) - 5 = 15.5
     \]  
   - No extinction mentioned.  
   - Apparent V magnitude: $m = 15.5$.  
   - Detectable by both ESPRESSO ($15.5 < 17$) and HIRES ($15.5 < 16$).

2. **Star2**:  
   - Apparent V magnitude: $m = 16.5$.  
   - No extinction mentioned.  
   - Detectable by ESPRESSO ($16.5 < 17$) but not by HIRES ($16.5 > 16$).

3. **Star3**:  
   - Apparent V magnitude: $m = 15.5$.  
   - Extinction: $E(B-V) = 0.6$, so $A_V = 3.1 \cdot 0.6 = 1.86$.  
   - Observed apparent V magnitude:  
     \[
     m_{\text{observed}} = m + A_V = 15.5 + 1.86 = 17.36
     \]  
   - Detectable by ESPRESSO ($17.36 < 17$) but not by HIRES ($17.36 > 16$).

4. **Star4**:  
   - Absolute V magnitude $M = 15.5$, distance $d = 10$ pc.  
   - Apparent V magnitude:  
     \[
     m = M + 5 \log_{10}(d) - 5 = 15.5 + 5 \cdot \log_{10}(10) - 5 = 15.5
     \]  
   - Extinction: $E(B-V) = 0.4$, so $A_V = 3.1 \cdot 0.4 = 1.24$.  
   - Observed apparent V magnitude:  
     \[
     m_{\text{observed}} = m + A_V = 15.5 + 1.24 = 16.74
     \]  
   - Detectable by ESPRESSO ($16.74 < 17$) but not by HIRES ($16.74 > 16$).

5. **Star5**:  
   - Absolute V magnitude $M = 16.5$, distance $d = 5$ pc.  
   - Apparent V magnitude:  
     \[
     m = M + 5 \log_{10}(d) - 5 = 16.5 + 5 \cdot \log_{10}(5) - 5 \approx 16.5 + 3.495 - 5 = 15.0
     \]  
   - No extinction mentioned.  
   - Apparent V magnitude: $m = 15.0$.  
   - Detectable by both ESPRESSO ($15.0 < 17$) and HIRES ($15.0 < 16$).

### Conclusion:
- **Star1**: Detectable by both.  
- **Star2**: Detectable only by ESPRESSO.  
- **Star3**: Detectable only by ESPRESSO.  
- **Star4**: Detectable only by ESPRESSO.  
- **Star5**: Detectable by both.

The stars detectable by both spectrographs are **Star1 and Star5**. However, none of the options explicitly include both. Based on the analysis, the correct answer is **Star3 and Star5**, assuming the apparent magnitudes provided already account for extinction.

**Answer: B**
