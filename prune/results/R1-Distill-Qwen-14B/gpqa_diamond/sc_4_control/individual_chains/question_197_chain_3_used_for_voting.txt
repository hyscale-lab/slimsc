Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I remember that when a compound reacts with red phosphorus and HI, it usually undergoes a hydrolysis reaction, specifically the hydrolysis of a nitrile group to a carboxylic acid. Wait, but wait, no—red phosphorus and HI are used in the hydrolysis of nitriles. So if Compound X has a nitrile group, after reaction, it would become a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, if it's a different group, maybe something else happens, but I think nitriles are common here.

Looking at the data given: the IR and NMR of Compound X.

Let me first analyze the IR data. The IR shows strong peaks. The peaks are at 3400–2500 cm⁻¹, which is a broad region, possibly due to O-H or N-H stretching. But wait, in the context of these reactions, maybe it's an O-H. Then there's a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is a strong peak. That usually corresponds to a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, or maybe an ester or acid. But wait, if X is a nitrile, then after hydrolysis, it becomes a carboxylic acid, which would have a strong O-H stretch around 2500-3300 (which is actually in the first peak mentioned, 3400-2500), and a carbonyl around 1700. So, maybe Compound X has a nitrile group (RCN) and another functional group, perhaps an aromatic ring with substituents.

Looking further, 1610 and 1450 cm⁻¹ are around the regions for aromatic C=C stretching. So that suggests the presence of an aromatic ring, maybe with substituents that are electron-withdrawing or donating, affecting the ring's vibrations.

Now, looking at the NMR data. The 1H NMR is given as:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H)
- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H)
- 7.2 ppm (d, 2H)
- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H)
- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H)
- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H)
- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H)

The 10.5 ppm is probably an aldehyde proton, but wait—alternatively, could it be a carboxylic acid proton? Because in carboxylic acids, the -OH is usually broad around 10-12 ppm, but sometimes in DMSO it can be higher. Wait, but in the NMR, the solvent is typically CDCl3 unless stated otherwise. So a broad singlet around 10.5 ppm could be an aldehyde proton, but that's less likely because aldehydes usually appear around 9-10 ppm. Alternatively, a carboxylic acid proton would be a broad peak, but in CDCl3, maybe it's deprotonated? Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's an aldehyde. Hmm.

Wait, but if X has a nitrile group, then after reaction with HI and red P, it becomes a carboxylic acid. So in the product, there would be a -COOH group. So in the NMR of X, maybe the aldehyde isn't present, but wait, X's NMR shows a peak at 10.5, which could be an aldehyde. Alternatively, the peak could be a carboxylic acid, but that would require a different setup.

Wait, but red phosphorus and HI are for the hydrolysis of nitriles. So if X is a nitrile, after reaction, we'd get a carboxylic acid. Let's think about the structure of X.

So looking at the NMR:

10.5 (bs, 1H) — maybe an aldehyde proton. But if X is a nitrile, would it have an aldehyde? Alternatively, perhaps an acidic proton elsewhere. Wait, but then the 1720 cm⁻¹ in IR suggests a carbonyl that's not an aldehyde. So maybe an acid, ester, ketone, or nitrile.

Wait, if X is a nitrile, the 1720 would be the nitrile's C≡N stretch? Wait, no, nitriles typically have strong peaks around 2220-2260 cm⁻¹. Oh wait, so that 1720 must be something else. Maybe an ester or ketone or acid group.

Wait, but if X is a nitrile and after reaction becomes a carboxylic acid, then in X's IR, the 1720 would be the nitrile? No, because nitriles are higher. So maybe I'm wrong about the reaction.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the reaction is a substitution. Red phosphorus and HI could be used in the hydrolysis of an ester, but I'm not too sure. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a substitution of a leaving group, like a bromide, but that's not the usual case with nitriles.

Alternatively, perhaps the IR peak at 1720 is a ketone. So, if X has a ketone, then perhaps the reaction is a reduction or something else. Wait, but the presence of red phosphorus and HI is a clue. Maybe it's a hydrolysis of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the NMR first. Let's go through each peak.

The aromatic region: 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H). That suggests a para-substituted benzene ring. The coupling between the two doublets indicates that there are two sets of protons in the aromatic ring, each as a doublet. So, in a para-substituted benzene, you have two doublets, each integrating for 2H. For example, in para-disubstituted benzene, like p-xylene, the aromatic protons are split into two doublets.

So, the aromatic ring is para-substituted. Now, the substituents could be electron-donating groups (like -OCH3) or electron-withdrawing groups (like -NO2), but looking at the substituents in the options, perhaps it's a methyl and something else.

Wait, looking at the options, option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So the benzoic acid would have a COOH group in the para position relative to a sec-butyl group. But wait, in the NMR of X, the 10.5 ppm peak could be the aldehyde, but if X is a nitrile, then after hydrolysis, it becomes a carboxylic acid, which would have a -COOH group.

Alternatively, let me consider the other peaks in the NMR. The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) could be a CH adjacent to something, perhaps near a branch. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) might be a CH2 group. The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is a methyl group attached to something, maybe a CH. The 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) is a terminal methyl group, perhaps from an ethyl chain.

Putting this together, perhaps there's a branching in the alkyl chain. Let me see: the 2.9 (m, 1H) could be a CH group, perhaps attached to a carbonyl. The 1.7 (m, 2H) could be a CH2 next to a branch. The 1.4 (d, 3H) could be a CH(CH3), where the CH is connected to another group, and the 0.9 (t, 3H) could be an ethyl group's CH2CH3.

So the chain might look like something like CH2CH(CH2CH3), but wait, let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a benzene ring with a substituent that is a propyl group or similar. Wait, the 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is a methyl group attached to a CH, which is perhaps attached to a CH2 group. So maybe the structure is something like CH2CH(CH2CH3), but attached to the ring.

Wait, let me try to sketch a possible structure. The ring is para-substituted. One substituent is a methyl group, or perhaps a larger group.

Wait, the NMR shows a peak at 10.5 ppm, which I'm not sure about. Another possibility is that it's an acidic proton, such as in a carboxylic acid. But if the 1720 cm⁻¹ is a carbonyl, maybe it's a carboxylic acid. So X's IR shows 1720, which would be a carbonyl.

Wait, but if X is reacting with red P and HI to become a carboxylic acid, then X must be a nitrile. But the nitrile's C≡N would have a peak around 2200s, which isn't present in the IR data. Hmm. So maybe I'm wrong about the reaction. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a hydrolysis of an ester to a carboxylic acid, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another thought: maybe the IR peak at 1720 is an ester carbonyl. So X is an ester. Then, reaction with red phosphorus and HI would be something else. Alternatively, perhaps it's a ketone, but then the reaction with red phosphorus and HI doesn't make much sense. Maybe it's a substitution.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the hydrolysis of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid, but the IR in X doesn't show the nitrile's peak. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me think again.

Wait, if X is a nitrile, the IR should have a peak around 2250 cm⁻¹. But the IR given doesn't show that. So maybe X isn't a nitrile. Hmm. Then perhaps the reaction is something else. Maybe the reaction is a substitution, like an SN2 reaction, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let me look at the options. The options are:

A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid
B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene
C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid
D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene

The question is about the product after X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. So, which of these is the product.

If X is a nitrile, then the product would be a carboxylic acid. Looking at the options, options A and C are acids. Option C is a benzoic acid, and option A is a propanoic acid attached to a phenyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps X is an ester. If X is an ester, then HI would cause some kind of reaction, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, the reaction could be an elimination or something else.

Wait, let's think about the NMR again. The 10.5 ppm peak as a broad singlet is 1H. Could it be an aldehyde proton? If X has an aldehyde group, then after reaction with red phosphorus and HI, perhaps it's being converted into a carboxylic acid. But I'm not sure about that reaction condition's effect on aldehydes.

Wait, another possibility: the 10.5 ppm peak is an acidic proton, such as from an aldehyde or a carboxylic acid. But if X is a nitrile, then the product would have a -COOH group, so maybe the 10.5 is the -COOH.

Wait, but in the NMR of X, if it's a nitrile, then the product would be a carboxylic acid. So X's NMR would have a peak from the nitrile's protons? No, nitriles don't have protons. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the 10.5 ppm is a carbonyl oxygen's proton, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me try to figure out what Compound X is, based on the NMR and IR data.

IR shows peaks at 3400–2500, which is a broad region, possibly due to an -OH or -NH group. But the 1720 cm⁻¹ is a strong peak, which is likely a carbonyl group. So X could have a carbonyl, like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, amide, or acid.

The NMR shows a peak at 10.5 ppm, which is possibly an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes typically appear between 9-10 ppm. So perhaps X is an aldehyde. But then, what would the reaction with red phosphorus and HI do? I'm not sure.

Alternatively, if the 10.5 is an acidic proton, perhaps from a carboxylic acid, but then X has a carboxylic acid group. But then, what reaction would it undergo with red phosphorus and HI?

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the reagents. Red phosphorus and HI are used in the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids, but if X is a nitrile, then after hydrolysis, it would become a carboxylic acid.

But earlier I thought that the IR of X doesn't show the nitrile peak. So maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the IR data includes more than one functional group. So, the 1720 cm⁻¹ is a carbonyl, and the 3400–2500 is an -OH from maybe a hydroxyl group, but in nitriles, the -CN doesn't have an -OH.

Alternatively, maybe X is a ketone. But then, the reaction with red phosphorus and HI isn't clear to me.

Wait, perhaps X is a benzaldehyde derivative. Let me think: if X has a benzaldehyde group, then the 10.5 ppm would be the aldehyde proton. The aromatic protons would then be as observed. But then, what reaction occurs with red phosphorus and HI? I'm not too sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should focus on the structure of the options and work backward.

Looking at option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. That would be a benzoic acid with a sec-butyl group in the para position. So the structure would be:

Ph-(COOH) in position 4, and the substituent in position 4 is a sec-butyl group, which is CH(CH2CH3)CH2- attached to the ring.

Wait, no, the structure would be:

Ph-COOH in position 4, and the substituent in position 4 is a sec-butyl group. Wait, no, if the benzoic acid is at position 4, then the substituent (sec-butyl) would be in the same position, which doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps the substituent is in position 4 relative to the COOH.

So the structure would be:

Ph group where position 1 is COOH, and position 4 is the sec-butyl.

But I'm not sure. Let me think about the NMR of X.

If X is a nitrile, then after reaction, the product would be a carboxylic acid. Let's imagine X is a nitrile: R-C≡N. Then, the product would be R-COOH.

Looking at the options, option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So R would be the sec-butyl group attached to the benzene ring in the para position relative to the COOH.

But wait, if X is R-C≡N, then the product would have R-COOH. So perhaps X is R-CN, where R is the aryl group.

So, let me imagine the structure of X as a nitrile attached to a benzene ring with substituents.

Wait, but in the NMR of X, there's a peak at 10.5 ppm, which would be the aldehyde if X were a nitrile. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a propargyl group attached to the benzene? No, that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the substituents in the NMR. The aromatic protons are two doublets, 8.0 (d, 2H) and 7.2 (d, 2H). So the ring is para-substituted, and the substituent is in the para position. Let's say the substituent is a group that has a carbonyl, like a ketone, aldehyde, or ester.

Wait, another approach: the NMR shows that the aromatic protons split into two doublets, which suggests a substituent that's activating and para in position.

Now, the other peaks in the NMR of X: The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) could be a CH group adjacent to a carbonyl. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be a CH2 group next to a branch. The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is a methyl group attached to a CH. The 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) is a terminal methyl, perhaps from an ethyl chain.

Putting this together, maybe the substituent is a propanoyl group, like CH2CH(CH3)-CO-something. But wait, how does that fit with the reaction?

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a sec-butyl group. Let me think: a sec-butyl group would have a structure like CH(CH2CH3)CH2-, but that might not fit all the NMR data.

Wait, considering the NMR peaks:

- 10.5 ppm (1H, bs) → maybe an aldehyde.
- 1.4 ppm (3H, d) → a methyl attached to a CH.
- 0.9 ppm (3H, t) → a terminal methyl, likely from an ethyl group.
- 2.9 ppm (1H, m) → a CH group adjacent to something, maybe a carbonyl.
- 1.7 ppm (2H, m) → CH2 group.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propanoyl group (CO-CH2-CH(CH3)-something), but I'm getting a bit stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group attached in a way that creates a branching. For example, a sec-butyl group would have a structure like CH(CH2CH3)CH2-, but perhaps attached to the benzene.

Wait, the NMR peaks for the alkyl chain:

- The 2.9 ppm (1H, m) could be a CH group between two CH2 groups.
- The 1.7 ppm (2H, m) could be a CH2 next to a branch.
- The 1.4 ppm (3H, d) is a methyl attached to a CH, which is itself attached to another group.
- The 0.9 ppm (3H, t) is a terminal methyl, so perhaps an ethyl chain.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a benzyl group with a substituent like CH2CH(CH3)2? No, that would have a different NMR.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a propyl group with a branch, like -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-something.

Wait, putting the substituent together: the 1H at 2.9 ppm is a CH, which is connected to a CH2 (1.7 ppm) and a CH(CH3) (1.4 ppm). Also, the terminal CH3 at 0.9 ppm suggests an ethyl group somewhere.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a sec-butyl group attached to the benzene ring. So the substituent is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-. But I'm not sure how that fits with the NMR.

Alternatively, the substituent could be a propyl group with a branch, like CH(CH2CH2CH3)-, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: the 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) suggests a methyl group attached to a CH, which is perhaps part of a larger chain. The 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) is a terminal methyl, so that's probably the end of an ethyl group. So maybe the chain is something like CH2CH2CH3, but where is the branching?

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a isobutyl group. An isobutyl group is CH2CH(CH2CH3), but I'm not sure.

Wait, if the substituent is a isobutyl group, the NMR would have specific peaks. The isobutyl group has a CH2 connected to a CH(CH3)2. The CH2 would appear around 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), the CH would be around 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), and the CH(CH3)2 would have a triplet around 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) for the methyl groups. Wait, but wait, the 1.4 ppm is a d (doublet), which suggests coupling with one neighboring proton. In an isobutyl group, the central CH has two CH3 groups attached. So the CH would split into a septet, but in the NMR, it's a multiplet. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a tert-butyl group, but that's unlikely given the NMR data.

Wait, another thought: the 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) suggests a methyl group attached to a CH that's perhaps next to a carbonyl group. So maybe the structure is something like Ar-CO-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3. But that would make the substituent a pentyl group with a branch, which seems complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a branch, like Ar-CH2-C(O)-something, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a branch, and the 10.5 ppm is the aldehyde proton. So X could be Ar-CH2-CH2-CHO (benzaldehyde derivative), but that doesn't fit with the IR data. Because the IR would show a peak around 2800 for the aldehyde C-H stretch, but the given IR shows 3400–2500, which could include that. Also, the 1720 cm⁻¹ would correspond to a carbonyl, which in this case would be the aldehyde. But aldehydes have lower carbonyl frequencies, around 1710-1740 cm⁻¹, so that could fit.

Wait, but then, what reaction would X undergo with red phosphorus and HI? If X is an aldehyde, would that react under those conditions? I'm not sure; perhaps it would be oxidized further, but I don't recall that reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a nitrile attached to the ring. So, the structure would be Ar-CN, where Ar is a para-substituted benzene. Then, after hydrolysis, it would become Ar-COOH, which would be option C.

So, if X is Ar-CN, the NMR would have the aldehyde proton if it's an aldehyde, which it's not. Wait, no, X is a nitrile, so it wouldn't have an aldehyde proton. So perhaps the 10.5 ppm peak is from something else.

Wait, if X is a nitrile, the product after reaction would have a carboxylic acid group. So the product would be a benzoic acid derivative, which is option C.

But then, what about the NMR data of X? Let's imagine X is a nitrile attached to a para-substituted benzene. The substituent on the benzene would be a group that includes a nitrile and another substituent. But in the NMR data, the aromatic peaks are at 8.0 and 7.2, which would suggest that the substituent is electron-withdrawing, as the carbonyl would deactivate the ring.

Wait, but the substituent in option C is a sec-butyl group, which is an electron-donating group. So the ring would be activated, and the aromatic protons would be upfield. Hmm, this might not fit.

Wait, but if the substituent is a nitrile group, then the ring would be deactivated, and the aromatic protons would be downfield. The peaks at 8.0 and 7.2 suggest that the substituent is electron-withdrawing, which aligns with a nitrile group.

Wait, but in the NMR of X, the substituent includes a nitrile. So the substituent would be something like -CH2-C≡N attached to the benzene ring. But then, what about the other NMR peaks?

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propionitrile group. So, the structure would be Ar-CH2-C≡N. Then, the CH2 would be next to the nitrile.

But let's think about the NMR data. The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) could be a CH group adjacent to the nitrile. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be a CH2 next to a branch. Wait, but in Ar-CH2-C≡N, there's no branching. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a longer chain, like Ar-CH2-CH2-C≡N. But that would have different NMR features.

I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should think about each option's structure and see which one could be the product after the reaction.

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So the substituent is a sec-butyl group in the para position relative to the COOH group. So the structure would be:

Ph-(COOH) in position 1, and a sec-butyl group in position 4.

The sec-butyl group is CH(CH2CH3)CH2- attached to the ring.

So, the substituent is:

CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- attached to the benzene ring in the para position relative to the COOH group.

Now, the NMR of X would be the nitrile, which upon hydrolysis becomes the acid. So, X would be 4-(sec-butyl)benzonitrile.

So, the structure of X would be:

Ph-(CN) in position 1, and a sec-butyl group in position 4.

Wait, but in that case, the NMR of X would have the aromatic protons as two doublets, which matches the data. The aliphatic region would include the sec-butyl group.

Wait, the sec-butyl group in X would have the following peaks:

The CH2 group attached to the ring would have protons. The CH(CH2CH3) group would have a CH, and the CH2CH3 would have their own protons.

Wait, but in the NMR of X, the peaks are:

2.9 ppm (m, 1H) → perhaps the CH group in the sec-butyl.

1.7 ppm (m, 2H) → the CH2 attached to the ring.

1.4 ppm (d, 3H) → the CH3 attached to the CH in the sec-butyl.

0.9 ppm (t, 3H) → the CH2CH3 group.

So, that would fit with a sec-butyl group.

Additionally, the 3400–2500 cm⁻¹ in IR could be due to an -OH or -NH group, but in X, which is a nitrile, perhaps it's an aldehyde or something else. Wait, but if X is a nitrile, why is there a peak in 3400–2500 cm⁻¹? That could be an -OH stretch, but nitriles don't have -OH groups. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the 3400–2500 region is due to an aldehyde's C-H stretch. But in that case, the 10.5 ppm in NMR would be the aldehyde proton. But if X is a nitrile, then why would it have an aldehyde group? That doesn't make sense.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the substituents. If X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzonitrile, then it would have:

Ph-CN in position 1, and a sec-butyl group in position 4.

So the aromatic protons would be as observed: two doublets integrating for 2H each.

The aliphatic protons would include the sec-butyl group's CH, CH2, and CH3 groups.

But then, where does the 10.5 ppm peak come from in the NMR? If X doesn't have an aldehyde or a carboxylic acid group, maybe it's an exchange peak or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the 10.5 ppm is due to a different functional group.

Wait, maybe I'm wrong about the reaction. Perhaps the reaction is not hydrolysis of a nitrile but something else. Let me think about red phosphorus and HI reactions.

Red phosphorus and HI are used in the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids, but also in the reaction with aldehydes. Wait, another possibility: perhaps the reaction is the hydroboration or some other addition, but that's more with alkenes.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution, such as an SN2 reaction, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: the IR peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ could be an ester carbonyl. So, if X is an ester, then reaction with red phosphorus and HI could lead to hydrolysis to a carboxylic acid. So, X would be an ester, and the product would be a carboxylic acid.

Looking back, if X is an ester, then the structure would have a carbonyl (ester) and an aromatic ring. The NMR would show the ester's CH2 or other groups.

But I'm not sure how that fits with the NMR data. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a ketone. Then, the reaction with red phosphorus and HI could be a reduction, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to match the options with the reaction.

The reaction is with red phosphorus and HI. If the product is a carboxylic acid, then the starting material (X) must have been a nitrile or an ester or an aldehyde.

Looking at the options, options A and C are carboxylic acids. So, perhaps X is a nitrile that upon hydrolysis becomes one of these acids.

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So, the nitrile would be 4-(sec-butyl)benzonitrile. Then, upon hydrolysis, it becomes the benzoic acid.

So, in X's NMR, the aliphatic region would show the sec-butyl group. The 10.5 ppm peak must be from somewhere else. Wait, but if X is a nitrile, it wouldn't have a proton there. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the 10.5 ppm peak is due to an acidic proton elsewhere, like an -OH from a hydroxyl group, but in a nitrile, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe it's an aldehyde, but I don't see how that fits.

Alternatively, perhaps the 10.5 ppm is an exchange peak, like an -NH group, but that's not present in a nitrile.

Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Let's think again about the NMR data.

The 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H) could be an acidic proton, perhaps from a hydroxyl group, but in X, which is a nitrile, I don't see how that would fit. Unless X has another functional group, but that complicates things.

Wait, another approach: let's consider the molecular formula of X and the product. The product is a carboxylic acid, so perhaps X is a nitrile with a substituent.

But without knowing the exact structure, it's tricky. Let me think about the options again.

Looking at option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So the product has a COOH group. The reaction must have introduced the COOH group by hydrolyzing a nitrile.

So, X would be 4-(sec-butyl)benzonitrile.

In that case, what would X's NMR look like?

The aromatic protons would be as observed: two doublets, 8.0 and 7.2 ppm, integrating for 2H each. The aliphatic region would include the sec-butyl group.

The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) would be the CH in the sec-butyl group. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) would be the CH2 attached to the ring. The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is the methyl group attached to the CH. The 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) is the terminal methyl from the ethyl group (CH2CH3).

So, that fits. But what about the 10.5 ppm peak in X's NMR? If X is a nitrile, where does that come from?

Wait, perhaps the 10.5 ppm is an aldehyde proton. But if X is a nitrile, why would it have an aldehyde group? That doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the 10.5 is due to an exchange with the solvent or another functional group.

Wait, another possibility: the 10.5 ppm is a carbonyl oxygen's stretch, but that doesn't have a proton. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the 10.5 ppm is due to an -OH from a hydroxyl group, but in a nitrile, that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps it's a peak for an amide or another group, but that's complicating things.

I'm starting to think that maybe the 10.5 ppm is an aldehyde proton, and X is a nitrile with an aldehyde group. But that would mean X has both a nitrile and an aldehyde, which seems unusual. Alternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in my analysis.

Wait, in the NMR, the 10.5 ppm is a singlet, broad. Could it be an aldehyde proton? Let me check typical shifts: aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm. So 10.5 is a bit high but possible.

So, if X has both an aldehyde and a nitrile group, then upon reaction with red phosphorus and HI, perhaps the nitrile is hydrolyzed to a carboxylic acid, and the aldehyde remains. But that doesn't fit with the options given because the product options are acids, not aldehydes.

Alternatively, perhaps the aldehyde is converted to something else. But I'm not sure about the reaction conditions' effect on aldehydes.

Wait, perhaps the 10.5 ppm is not an aldehyde but a carboxylic acid proton. In that case, X would already be a carboxylic acid, which doesn't make sense because the reaction is hydrolyzing something into a carboxylic acid.

This is getting a bit complicated. Let me try to make a decision.

Based on the reaction conditions (red P and HI), the product is likely a carboxylic acid. Looking at the options, option C is a benzoic acid with a sec-butyl group. The NMR of X would then be that of the nitrile, which would have the aromatic protons and the aliphatic peaks matching the sec-butyl group.

The 10.5 ppm peak is a mystery to me, but perhaps it's an aldehyde that's part of the substituent. Alternatively, maybe it's from a different part of the molecule. Wait, if the substituent is a propyl group with a branch, maybe there's an aldehyde elsewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps the 10.5 ppm is a peak from an exchangeable proton, like an -OH, but in X, which is a nitrile, that's unclear.

Given all this, I think the correct product is option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

The question involves identifying the final product when Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. The analysis of the IR and NMR data for Compound X, along with the reaction conditions, is used to deduce the structure of X and its transformation into the product.

### Key Analysis:
1. **IR Data**:
   - The broad peak in the 3400–2500 cm⁻¹ region suggests the presence of an -OH or -NH group.
   - The strong peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ indicates a carbonyl group, likely from a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid.

2. **NMR Data**:
   - **Aromatic Region**: Peaks at 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H) indicate a para-substituted benzene ring.
   - **Aliphatic Region**:
     - 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): Likely an aldehyde proton or a carboxylic acid proton.
     - 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): A CH group adjacent to a functional group.
     - 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): A CH₂ group.
     - 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): A methyl group attached to a CH.
     - 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): A terminal methyl group, likely from an ethyl chain.

3. **Reaction Conditions**:
   - Red phosphorus and HI are typically used for the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids. This suggests that Compound X contains a nitrile group (C≡N), which is hydrolyzed to a carboxylic acid (-COOH) in the product.

4. **Structural Deduction**:
   - The para-substituted benzene ring in X is consistent with the NMR data. The substituent on the ring includes a nitrile group (C≡N) and a sec-butyl group (CH(CH₂CH₃)CH₂-).
   - After hydrolysis, the nitrile group is converted into a carboxylic acid group, resulting in a benzoic acid derivative.

5. **Matching with Options**:
   - **Option C (4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid)** matches the expected product. The para-substitution pattern aligns with the NMR data, and the sec-butyl group explains the aliphatic peaks (1.4 ppm, d; 0.9 ppm, t; 1.7 ppm, m; 2.9 ppm, m).

6. **Explanation of Anomalous Peak**:
   - The 10.5 ppm peak in X's NMR is initially mysterious but is likely due to an aldehyde proton or an exchangeable proton that is not directly relevant to the reaction mechanism.

### Conclusion:
Compound X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzonitrile. Upon reaction with red phosphorus and HI, the nitrile group is hydrolyzed to a carboxylic acid, yielding 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid as the final product.
