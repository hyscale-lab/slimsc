Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about starspots and exoplanets causing brightness variations. Hmm, let me try to understand what's going on.

The question says that we're observing a star with the same radius as the Sun. One hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a 20% filling factor. The star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are 1000K cooler. So when the star rotates, the spots come into view, causing the observed brightness to dip. But the twist is that this situation can look like an exoplanet causing the brightness variations. We need to find out the radius of a planet that would produce the same signal as the spots.

Wait, I remember that when a planet transits in front of a star, it blocks some of the star's light, causing a dip in brightness. The depth of this dip depends on the ratio of the planet's area to the star's area. Similarly, spots cause a dip because they're cooler and less bright. So the idea is to calculate the equivalent effect of the spots as if it were a planet blocking light.

Let's break this down. The star's radius is Rstar = R_sun. The spots cover a certain fraction of the star's surface. The filling factor is 20%, which I think means that 20% of the hemisphere is covered, so total spot coverage is 0.2 * (surface area of a hemisphere) divided by the total surface area of the star? Or wait, maybe the filling factor is the fraction of the star's surface covered by spots. Since it's one hemisphere, does the filling factor apply to that hemisphere?

Wait, the problem says one hemisphere is covered in spots with a filling factor of 20%. So I think that means 20% of the area of that hemisphere is spots. So the total area covered by spots is 0.2 * (4πR² / 2), because a hemisphere is half the surface area. But wait, wait. No, the total surface area of a sphere is 4πR². A hemisphere would be 2πR². So if the filling factor is 20% on the hemisphere, the area covered by spots is 0.2 * 2πR². So 0.4πR².

But wait, the star's radius is the same as the Sun, so Rstar = R_sun. The star's surface area is 4πRstar². So total area of the star is 4πR_sun². The area covered by spots is 0.2 * 2πR_sun² = 0.4πR_sun². So the total fractional area covered by spots is 0.4πR²/(4πR²) ) = 0.4/4 = 0.1, or 10%. Hmm, but wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the filling factor. Alternatively, maybe the filling factor is the fraction of the entire star's surface covered by spots. Because the problem says "one hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%." So maybe the entire star's surface is considered, and 20% of that is covered by spots. So total area is 4πR², and 20% of that is 0.2*4πR²=0.8πR². Wait, but that would mean the entire star has 20% coverage, but the problem says only one hemisphere. Hmm, maybe the 20% filling factor is for each hemisphere. Wait, perhaps the way to think about it is that each hemisphere (northern and southern) can have spots, but in this case, only one hemisphere is spotty, so the total spot area is 20% of the star's surface. Or maybe not. I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, filling factor is often defined as the fraction of the surface area covered by spots. So if the problem says the filling factor is 20%, that's 20% of the total star's surface is spots. But the spots are on one hemisphere, which is half the surface. So if the spots cover 20% of the entire star, that would imply they're spread over one hemisphere. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because 20% of the whole star is 0.2 * 4πR² = 0.8πR². But each hemisphere is 2πR², so 0.8π is 40% of a hemisphere. So in that case, the spots cover 40% of one hemisphere. But that would make the filling factor for the hemisphere 0.4, not 0.2. But the problem says the filling factor is 20%, so maybe the spots cover 20% of the hemisphere. So the total area covered is 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR². So the total spot area is 0.4πR², and the star's surface area is 4πR², so the spot coverage is 0.4/(4) = 0.1, 10% of the star's surface.

But wait, the problem says the star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are 1000K cooler, so 5000K. So each spot is cooler, but the question is about the change in brightness.

Wait, the brightness variation due to the planet is a simple occultation—blocking light. But for the spots, it's more about the change in flux when the spots come into view because they're darker. So the net effect on the light curve depends on the difference in brightness between the star and the spots.

So when the star is rotating, the spots come into and out of view. The observed brightness will dip when the spots are visible. The amplitude of this dip depends on the area of the spots and their brightness compared to the rest of the star.

But the question says that if the star wasn't covered by spots, what planet radius would produce the same amplitude in the light curve. So I need to compute the dip caused by the spots and set that equal to the dip caused by the planet.

Wait, but the dip caused by the planet is (Rp / Rstar)^2, because it's the area blocked. But for the spots, it's not exactly the same because the dip is due to the spots being darker, not blocking light. So the dip in brightness when the spots are facing us is (fraction of the star's surface with spots) multiplied by (the brightness difference between the spot and the rest of the star).

Wait, no. Let me think again. Let's model the star's brightness without spots first. The total flux is sigma * Teff^4, integrated over the surface. But when a spot is present, the flux is reduced by the area of the spot times the difference in brightness between the spot and the surrounding.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute the change in flux when the spots are on the visible side. The star's flux without spots is F0 = sigma * Teff^4. The flux with spots is F = F0 - (A_spot * (F0 - F_spot)), where A_spot is the area fraction covered by spots, and F_spot is the flux per unit area of the spots.

Wait, I think the way to compute the change in brightness is:

The total flux from the star when spots are visible is F_visible = F0 * (1 - A_spot) + F_spot * A_spot.

But F_spot is the flux from the spot, which is sigma * (T_spot)^4.

So the change in flux is delta_F = F_visible - F0 = F0 * (1 - A_spot) + A_spot * sigma T_spot^4 - F0 * 1.

Which simplifies to delta_F = - A_spot (F0 - sigma T_spot^4) = A_spot (sigma T_spot^4 - F0) ?

Wait, no. Let me think again.

F0 is the flux without any spots. When spots are present, the flux is F0 (for the non-spotted area) plus F_spot * A_spot (for the spotted area).

So F_visible = F0 * (1 - A_spot) + A_spot * sigma T_spot^4.

The change compared to F0 is delta_F = F_visible - F0 = - A_spot F0 + A_spot sigma T_spot^4 = A_spot (sigma T_spot^4 - F0).

But F0 is sigma Teff^4. So delta_F = A_spot (sigma (T_spot^4 - Teff^4)).

Wait, no. Let me compute F_visible:

F_visible = (1 - A_spot) * F0 + A_spot * F_spot.

But F_spot is sigma T_spot^4.

So, F_visible = F0 - A_spot (F0 - F_spot).

Thus, the change is delta_F = F_visible - F0 = - A_spot (F0 - F_spot).

Which is delta_F = A_spot (F_spot - F0).

But since F_spot is less than F0, delta_F is negative, meaning the total flux is lower.

But the amplitude of the brightness variation (the dip) is |delta_F|.

So the dip amplitude is A_spot (F0 - F_spot).

Now, F0 is sigma Teff^4, and F_spot is sigma T_spot^4.

So, dip = A_spot * sigma (Teff^4 - T_spot^4).

Wait, but A_spot is the area fraction. So the dip is:

dip = A_spot * (sigma Teff^4 - sigma T_spot^4) = A_spot * sigma (Teff^4 - T_spot^4).

Wait, but I'm not sure if this is the correct approach. Alternatively, perhaps the dip is the difference between the flux when the spots are on the visible side and when they're not. But perhaps the star's brightness without spots is F0, and when a spot is visible, the brightness is F0 minus the flux from the spot. So dip = A_spot * F0 * (1 - (T_spot^4 / Teff^4)), assuming that the spots are just black compared to the rest of the star, which isn't exactly the case, but perhaps an approximation.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to model the fractional change in brightness.

The fractional dip is (F_spot - F_unspot) / F_unspot, where F_unspot is the flux without spots.

Wait, no, when the spot is visible, the flux is F_visible = F_unspot - A_spot (F_unspot - F_spot). So the dip is A_spot (F_unspot - F_spot) / F_unspot.

Which is dip_fraction = A_spot (1 - (F_spot / F_unspot)).

So with F_spot = sigma T_spot^4, and F_unspot = sigma T_eff^4.

So dip_fraction = A_spot (1 - (T_spot^4 / Teff^4)).

Ah, that makes sense. Because when the spot is in view, the flux is lower by the area times the difference in flux per unit area.

So, dip_fraction = A_spot * (1 - (T_spot^4 / Teff^4)).

Now, in the problem, the star has a Teff of 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler, so T_spot = 5000 K.

So, Teff = 6000 K, T_spot = 5000 K.

So T_spot^4 = (5000)^4 = (5/6 * 6000)^4 = (5/6)^4 * (6000)^4.

So the dip_fraction is A_spot * (1 - (5/6)^4).

Compute (5/6)^4: 5^4 is 625, 6^4 is 1296. So 625/1296 ≈ 0.48225.

So 1 - 0.48225 = 0.51775.

So dip_fraction ≈ A_spot * 0.51775.

Now, what is A_spot? The area fraction covered by spots. The problem says the filling factor is 20% for one hemisphere.

Wait, so the filling factor is 20% for the hemisphere that's spotty. So the total area covered is 0.2 * (surface area of hemisphere) divided by the total surface area of the star.

Wait, surface area of a hemisphere is 2πR², and the total surface area is 4πR². So the filling factor for the entire star is (0.2 * 2πR²) / (4πR²) )= 0.4πR²/(4πR²) )= 0.1, or 10%.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the whole star's surface area is 4πR². The hemisphere has area 2πR². If the filling factor is 20%, that means 20% of that hemisphere's area is covered with spots. So the area covered by spots is 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR². Now, the fraction of the star's surface area is (0.4πR²) / (4πR²) )= 0.1, 10%.

So A_spot = 0.1.

Wait no, wait another moment. If the star's one hemisphere is covered with 20% filling factor, that is, 20% of that hemisphere's area is spots. So the total area covered by spots is 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4 π R². The total area of the star is 4 π R². So the filling factor (area covered) is 0.4 π R² / 4 π R² = 0.1 or 10%.

So A_spot = 0.1.

So dip_fraction = 0.1 * 0.51775 ≈ 0.051775, about 5.1775% dip.

Wait, but the problem says that this dip is equivalent to the dip caused by a planet transiting the star. So we need to find the planet radius that would cause the same dip.

The dip caused by a planet is (Rp / Rstar)^2. Because the area blocked is π Rp² compared to the star's area π Rstar². So the fractional dip is (Rp/Rstar)^2.

We need this dip to be equal to the dip from the spots, which we've calculated as about 0.051775.

So, (Rp / Rstar)^2 = 0.051775.

Taking square roots, Rp / Rstar = sqrt(0.051775) ≈ 0.2275.

Wait, so that's ~0.23. But looking at the options, the options are A) ~0.39, B) ~0.07, C) ~0.11, D) ~0.32.

Hmm, none of the options are around 0.23. Wait, did I make a mistake in my calculations?

Wait, let's recheck the dip_fraction calculation.

Wait, A_spot is 0.1 (10%), and (1 - (5/6)^4) is approximately 0.51775.

So 0.1 * 0.51775 ≈ 0.051775, correct.

So dip_fraction is about 5.18% for the spots. The planet's dip is (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.051775.

So Rp/Rstar = sqrt(0.051775) ≈ 0.2275, which is about 0.23.

But looking at the options, the closest is option D) ~0.32. Hmm, that's not close. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the dip calculation. Let's think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the dip from the spots is not 0.1 * (1 - (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4)) but something else.

Wait, maybe the approach is wrong because the spots are only on one hemisphere. So when the star rotates, the hemisphere is either visible or not. So the maximum dip is when the entire spotty hemisphere is visible.

Wait, but the star's rotation period would cause the spots to come into view. So when the spots are on the far side, there's no dip, and when they rotate into view, the dip is maximum. So the dip in brightness would be when the entire hemisphere is visible, but perhaps only 10% of the star's surface is spots.

Wait, no, regardless, the dip is the sum of all the spots in the visible hemisphere.

Wait, but when the star is rotating, the spots on the hemisphere come into view. So the dip is the sum of all the spots on the hemisphere. But the problem says that the filling factor is 20% for the hemisphere. So the area covered by spots in the visible hemisphere is 20% of the hemisphere's area.

Wait, perhaps I need to think about the maximum dip. When the entire spotty hemisphere is visible. So the area of the spotty hemisphere is 2πR², and the area covered by spots is 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR².

So the dip is 0.4πR² * (F0 - F_spot) / F0.

So dip_fraction = (0.4 π R²) / (4 π R²) ) * (F0 - F_spot)/F0.

Wait, (0.4 π R²) is the area of the spots. The total area is 4 π R², so 0.4 /4 = 0.1, same as before. So dip_fraction is 0.1 * (1 - (5/6)^4) ≈ 0.1 * 0.51775 ≈ 0.051775, as before.

Hmm, same result. So the dip is about 5.18%.

So planet dip is (Rp/Rstar)^2 ≈ 0.051775 → Rp/Rstar ≈ 0.2275.

But the options don't have that. So maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the dip calculation for the spots. Another approach is to calculate the average brightness change when the spots are on the surface.

Wait, another way: The brightness of the star when the spots are on the visible side is the sum of the brightness of the unspotted area and the spotted area.

So the total brightness without spots is F0 = sigma Teff^4 * 4π R² (but since we're dealing with fractions, we can ignore the constants).

The brightness when the spots are visible is F_visible = F0 * (1 - A_spot) + F_spot * A_spot.

F_spot is sigma T_spot^4.

So the fractional dip is (F0 - F_visible)/F0 = A_spot (F0 - F_spot)/F0.

Which is A_spot (1 - (T_spot^4 / Teff^4)).

Same as before.

So that part seems correct.

Hmm, maybe the problem is that the spots are on a hemisphere, so when the star rotates, the spots come into view, but the planet would cause a dip only when it's in front. So perhaps the maximum dip for the spots is when the entire spotty hemisphere is visible, but for the planet, the dip is when the planet transits, blocking a part of the star.

Wait, but the dip's amplitude is the same whether it's a spot or a planet. So regardless of other factors, the dip amplitude is the same.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the dip for the planet as (Rp^2)/(Rstar^2) = dip_fraction.

So 0.051775 = (Rp/Rstar)^2 → Rp/Rstar ≈ 0.2275.

Hmm, but the options don't have this. So I must be missing something.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the area fraction. Let me reevaluate A_spot.

Wait, the problem says one hemisphere is covered in spots with a filling factor of 20%. So the entire star's surface is 4πR². One hemisphere is 2πR². The spots cover 20% of that hemisphere, so 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR².

So the area of the spots is 0.4πR². The area of the star is 4πR², so the filling factor (area fraction) is 0.4/(4) = 0.1 or 10%.

So A_spot = 0.1.

Hmm, that seems correct.

Wait, maybe I should calculate the dip in terms of the brightness change when the spot is in the field of view, but perhaps I'm considering the entire area of spots as being visible when the star rotates. So perhaps the maximum dip is when the entire spotty hemisphere is visible, but that's not the case, right? Because the spots are on a hemisphere, but as the star rotates, the spots on the far side are not visible. So when the star is viewed edge-on, the spotty hemisphere is partially visible. Wait, perhaps the maximum dip occurs when the entire spotty hemisphere is visible, but that would require the star to be viewed from the same pole as the spotty hemisphere, which isn't the case in most observations. Hmm, but the problem states that the photometric time-series will show periodic variations due to rotational modulation. So the dip is caused by the spots rotating into and out of view as the star spins.

So perhaps the maximum dip is when the maximum number of spots is visible. But the maximum number is the entire hemisphere's worth of spots. Wait, but the filling factor is 20% of the hemisphere. So the maximum dip would be when the entire 0.2 * hemisphere is visible. Wait, no. The hemisphere is 2πR², and 20% of that is 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR². So when the star is viewed such that the spotty hemisphere is facing us, the dip is maximum.

Wait, but when the star is viewed face-on to the spotty hemisphere, the entire 0.4πR² is visible. So in that position, the dip is A_spot (1 - (T_spot^4 / Teff^4)) = 0.1 * 0.51775 ≈ 0.051775.

But if the star is viewed edge-on, then only a portion of the spots are visible. So perhaps the average dip depends on the viewing angle, but the problem states that the brightness variation is periodic due to rotation, so the maximum dip is when the spotty hemisphere is facing us, and the minimum when it's on the far side.

Wait, but the problem states that the maximum dip is similar to an exoplanet. So perhaps the dip amplitude is when the entire spotty hemisphere is visible, which would be when the star is viewed from the pole (face-on to the spots), hence the maximum dip.

But in reality, the star's inclination would affect how much of the hemisphere is visible. But perhaps for the purpose of this problem, we can assume that the maximum dip is when the entire spotty area is visible.

Wait, but in that case, the area covered is 0.4πR².

Wait, let me recompute A_spot in this scenario. The area of the star is 4πR², and the maximum area visible when the spotty hemisphere is facing us is 2πR². The spots cover 20% of that, so 0.4πR².

So the area of the spots visible is 0.4πR².

So the area fraction is 0.4πR² / 4πR² = 0.1, same as before.

So dip_fraction is 0.1 * (1 - (5/6)^4) ≈ 0.051775.

So the dip from the spots is about 5.18%.

So a planet would have to cause the same dip, which is (Rp/Rstar)^2 ≈ 0.051775 → Rp ≈ 0.2275 Rstar.

But none of the options are around 0.23. The closest is option D) ~0.32, which is about 0.32 Rstar. Hmm, that's almost twice as big as our calculation.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the way I'm calculating the dip. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the dip from the spots is not just the area times the flux difference, but the brightness variation is due to the spot's brightness compared to the rest of the star. So when the star rotates, the spots come into view, causing a dip in brightness because they are darker. But the dip is the difference between the star's brightness without spots and with spots.

Wait, perhaps the dip is the change in brightness when the spots are in view. So F_visible = F0 (1 - A_spot) + F_spot * A_spot.

So dip = F0 - F_visible = F0 * A_spot (1 - (F_spot / F0)).

So dip = A_spot * F0 * (1 - (F_spot / F0)).

Which is the same as F0 * dip_fraction.

But dip_fraction is A_spot * (1 - (F_spot / F0)).

Which is the same as before.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made an error in the calculation of (5/6)^4.

Let me recalculate (5/6)^4:

5/6 = 0.8333...

(0.8333)^4: 0.8333^2 is approximately 0.6944. Then square that: 0.6944^2 ≈ 0.48225. So (5/6)^4 ≈ 0.48225.

So 1 - 0.48225 = 0.51775. That's correct.

So dip_fraction is 0.1 * 0.51775 = 0.051775.

Hmm.

Wait, maybe the problem is that the spot is cooler, but when the spot is in front, it's not blocking the star's light but just being less bright. So perhaps the dip is the same as if the planet were covering that same area, but with the spot's lower brightness.

Wait, but in the planet case, the dip is (Rp/Rstar)^2 * F0, because the planet blocks F0 * (Rp^2/Rstar^2).

In the spot case, the dip is dip = A_spot * F0 (1 - (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4)).

So dip from spots = dip from planet.

So,

A_spot * F0 (1 - (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4)) = (Rp^2 / Rstar^2) * F0.

Cancel F0 from both sides,

A_spot (1 - (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4)) = (Rp/Rstar)^2.

So,

Rp/Rstar = sqrt( A_spot (1 - (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4)) )

Which is sqrt( 0.1 * (1 - (5/6)^4) ) = sqrt(0.1 * 0.51775) ≈ sqrt(0.051775) ≈ 0.2275, as before.

Hmm, same result. So I'm confident that's correct. But looking at the options, none match. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption.

Wait, perhaps the problem says that the star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. So spots are 5000 K.

Wait, but when you're calculating the dip, the spot's flux is lower. So F_spot = sigma * T_spot^4.

So, dip_fraction = A_spot * (1 - (F_spot / F0)).

Which is same as before.

So, is there another factor I'm missing?

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the spots are on only one hemisphere, so when the star is viewed from an angle, the area of the spots visible is less than the maximum. So the dip varies with the rotation period, but the maximum dip would be when the entire spotty hemisphere is visible. So perhaps the average dip over the rotation period is the same as the planet's dip.

Wait, but the planet's dip is only when it's in front, so the dip is a single event. The star's dip is periodic as the spots rotate into view.

Wait, but the problem states that the photometric observations will show periodic variations, which can resemble an exoplanet transit. So perhaps the amplitude of the dip is being compared, not the duration.

So the maximum dip amplitude from the spots is 5.18%, and the planet's dip is (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 5.18%.

So Rp/Rstar = sqrt(0.051775) ≈ 0.2275.

Again, none of the options are close. So perhaps I need to reevaluate the initial assumption about the area covered.

Wait, the problem says one hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%. So perhaps the area of the spots is 20% of the entire star's surface, not just the hemisphere. So the entire star's surface area is 4πR². If the filling factor is 20%, then area covered is 0.2 * 4πR² = 0.8πR².

So A_spot = 0.8πR² /4πR² = 0.2.

Wait, so A_spot is 0.2, 20% of the star's surface.

Then dip_fraction = 0.2 * (1 - (5/6)^4) ≈ 0.2 * 0.51775 ≈ 0.10355.

So dip_fraction is approximately 10.355%.

Then, the planet's dip is (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.10355.

Rp/Rstar = sqrt(0.10355) ≈ 0.3218.

That's around 0.32, which matches option D.

Ah, so perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption about the filling factor. The problem says that the filling factor is 20% for one hemisphere. So perhaps the area covered is 20% of the entire star's surface, which would be 0.2 * 4πR² = 0.8π R².

Wait, but that would mean that the spots are covering 20% of the entire star, regardless of the hemisphere. So if the star has a radius equal to the Sun, and the spots are on one hemisphere, but the filling factor is 20% of the entire star's surface, then A_spot is 0.2.

Oh! That makes sense. So that would change the calculation.

So, let's re-calculate with A_spot = 0.2.

dip_fraction = 0.2 * (1 - (5/6)^4) = 0.2 * 0.51775 ≈ 0.10355.

Then, the planet's dip is (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.10355 → Rp/Rstar = sqrt(0.10355) ≈ 0.3218, which is approximately 0.32, matching option D.

So the correct answer is D) ~0.32.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation as the star's spots, we analyze the problem as follows:

### Key Information:
1. **Star Properties**:
   - Radius: \( R_{\text{star}} = R_{\odot} \) (same as the Sun).
   - Effective temperature: \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \).
   - One hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%.

2. **Spot Properties**:
   - Temperature: \( T_{\text{spot}} = T_{\text{eff}} - 1000 \, \text{K} = 5000 \, \text{K} \).
   - Filling factor: 20% of the hemisphere is covered by spots.

3. **Objective**:
   - Find the radius of an exoplanet (\( R_{\text{pl}} \)) such that the brightness variation caused by the planet matches the amplitude of the brightness variation caused by the spots.

---

### Analysis:
#### Step 1: Brightness Variation Due to Spots
The brightness variation (\( \Delta F \)) caused by the spots depends on the area of the spots (\( A_{\text{spot}} \)) and the temperature difference between the spots and the rest of the star. The fractional brightness variation is given by:

\[
\Delta F_{\text{fraction}} = A_{\text{spot}} \cdot \left( 1 - \left( \frac{T_{\text{spot}}}{T_{\text{eff}}} \right)^4 \right).
\]

- **Area of Spots**:
  The total surface area of the star is \( 4\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \). The filling factor is 20%, meaning 20% of the star's surface is covered by spots:
  \[
  A_{\text{spot}} = 0.2.
  \]

- **Temperature Ratio**:
  \[
  \left( \frac{T_{\text{spot}}}{T_{\text{eff}}} \right)^4 = \left( \frac{5000}{6000} \right)^4 = \left( \frac{5}{6} \right)^4 \approx 0.48225.
  \]

- **Fractional Brightness Variation**:
  Substituting values:
  \[
  \Delta F_{\text{fraction}} = 0.2 \cdot \left( 1 - 0.48225 \right) = 0.2 \cdot 0.51775 \approx 0.10355.
  \]

Thus, the fractional brightness variation caused by the spots is approximately \( 0.10355 \) or \( 10.355\% \).

#### Step 2: Brightness Variation Due to a Planet
The brightness variation caused by a planet transiting the star is proportional to the square of the ratio of the planet's radius to the star's radius:

\[
\Delta F_{\text{fraction}} = \left( \frac{R_{\text{pl}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2.
\]

To match the brightness variation caused by the spots, we set:
\[
\left( \frac{R_{\text{pl}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2 = 0.10355.
\]

Taking the square root:
\[
\frac{R_{\text{pl}}}{R_{\text{star}}} = \sqrt{0.10355} \approx 0.3218.
\]
