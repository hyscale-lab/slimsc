Okay, so I've got this question here about a scientific experiment involving ligand-receptor pairs and some mouse models. Let me try to work through this step by step.

Alright, the setup: the researcher has identified a new ligand-receptor pair expressed in neural crest cells. They want to understand their interaction's developmental fate. The receptor is a monomeric transmembrane protein with eight alpha helices, four extracellular (so probably part of the binding site), and three beta sheets creating a binding site for the ligand. The ligand is a coiled-coil made of two alpha helices, which I think means it's probably a dimer or has some sort of structure that allows it to form a complex.

They've created a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. Wait, bicistronic means it has two ORFs, right? So they're using a vector that can express two proteins from a single transcript, each under their own promoters or something. The ligand's ORF is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry. The receptor is at the 3' end, fused to eGFP at the C-terminus. 

The ligand is under the CBA promoter. I'm not sure about CBA, but I think it's a strong promoter. The receptor is after an IRES element, which is used to allow internal ribosome entry, so that the two ORFs can be expressed independently but from the same mRNA. So the vector has ligand (CBA promoter), then the IRES, then receptor.

Now, looking at the stop cassettes: between the ligand ORF and mCherry, there's a stop in a loxP-stop-loxP cassette. Similarly, between the receptor and eGFP is a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette. So I think this means that when the vector is introduced, without Cre, the stops prevent expression of mCherry and eGFP. But with Cre, which recognizes lox sites, it would excise the stops, allowing the fusion proteins to be made.

Wait, no, actually, the way it's structured is that the ligand is fused to mCherry, but there's a stop cassette in between. So normally, without Cre, the ligand would be expressed with the stop, preventing mCherry from being expressed. Similarly, the receptor is followed by a stop cassette before eGFP. So when Cre is present, it will excise the stops, allowing the ligand-mCherry and receptor-eGFP fusions to be expressed.

Then, the researcher made antibodies against the overexpressed proteins. They transfected primary astrocyte cultures with the plasmid and did a Western blot. The actin loading is a control, so the blot shows that the proteins are expressed proportionally. So the Western suggests that the constructs are being expressed.

Then, they made a mouse model homozygous for the construct in a wild-type background. They crossed these mice to SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice. SOX10 is a transcription factor important in neural crest development. So the Cre is under SOX10's control, probably active in neural crest-derived cells.

After the offspring are born, they visualize them under a confocal microscope looking for green signal, which would come from eGFP. But they see no green. Why?

The options are A to D.

Option A: ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship. Paracrine means they act locally but on nearby cells. But the question is about expression in the same cell? Hmm, not sure. If the ligand and receptor are in the same cell, you might get autocrine signaling, but the question is about the construct's expression.

Option B: the receptor-eGFP is stuck in the Golgi. The eGFP is a fusion at the C-terminus. If the receptor is properly trafficked, eGFP should be in the same compartment. But if the construct is stuck in the Golgi, then eGFP wouldn't be on the surface, so maybe not detected in the Western or in the live cell imaging. But in the Western, they probably used an antibody against the receptor, not eGFP. Wait, no: the Western was for the overexpressed proteins. So the eGFP might not be detected, but the question is about the Western blot showing expression. Maybe if the construct isn't trafficked, it's retained in the ER or Golgi, but the antibody could still detect it if it's expressed. But in the mouse, the construct is endogenous, so perhaps it's expressed but not at the cell surface.

Option C: the enhancer for ligand and receptor expression is missing. The vector has the CBA promoter for the ligand, which is a strong promoter. The receptor is under IRES, which is constitutive. So perhaps the expression isn't driven correctly in the cells where they need to be expressed. If the enhancer is missing, maybe the promoters aren't active. But the vector is bicistronic, so the promoters are present.

Wait, but the mouse model is homozygous for the construct. So maybe in the mouse, the construct is inserted into the genome, and the regulatory elements are intact. But perhaps without the correct enhancers, the ligand and receptor aren't expressed in the right places or at all. But the Western blot showed expression in the astrocytes, which are not neural crest-derived. So maybe in the mice, the expression is not happening in the right cells, hence no eGFP expression in the offspring.

But the mice are crossed with SOX10-Cre, which would drive Cre expression in neural crest cells. The construct has lox sites, so Cre would excise the stop cassettes only in those cells where Cre is active. So the ligand and receptor would be expressed in neural crest-derived cells, leading to eGFP expression in those cells. But the confocal shows no green. So perhaps the Cre isn't working properly, or the construct isn't being excised.

Wait, the vector is a lox-Cre vector. So the Cre would excise the stop cassettes, allowing the mCherry and eGFP to be expressed. If the Cre isn't active, then the stops aren't excised, and the fusion proteins aren't made. So the eGFP isn't expressed, hence no green.

But the problem says that after the offspring are born, they visualize under confocal, but no green. So perhaps the Cre isn't active, or the construct isn't properly excised.

Alternatively, maybe the Western blot was positive because the vector was transfected into the astrocytes, but in the mouse, the construct is in the germline, but maybe the promoters aren't active in the mouse, or the Cre isn't active, so the eGFP isn't expressed.

Wait, but the mouse is homozygous for the construct. SOX10-Cre is a transgenic mouse where Cre is expressed under the control of the SOX10 promoter, which is active in neural crest cells. So when the offspring are born, the Cre should be active in neural crest-derived cells, excising the lox sites, allowing the eGFP to be expressed.

But the question is why there's no green. So possible issues: the Cre isn't active, or the construct isn't excised, or the eGFP isn't expressed.

Looking at the options:

Option C says the enhancer is missing. But the CBA promoter should drive expression regardless of enhancers, I think. Unless it's a tissue-specific enhancer.

Alternatively, maybe the construct wasn't properly inserted into the genome, but the question says it's homozygous, so it's present.

Another possibility is the expression cassette is not correctly set up. Looking at the vector design: the vector is bicistronic, with ligand under CBA, followed by IRES, then receptor. So the ligand is expressed first, then the IRES drives the receptor. But when Cre is present, it excises the stop cassettes, allowing the mCherry and eGFP fusions to be expressed.

Wait, the ligand ORF is at 5' with mCherry after a stop in a loxP cassette. So when Cre is present, it will excise the loxP-stop, allowing ligand-mCherry to be expressed as a fusion. Similarly, the receptor-eGFP would be expressed after Cre excises the lox2272 stop.

But in the mouse, the Cre is under SOX10, which is active in neural crest cells. So in those cells, Cre is active, and the stops are excised, leading to expression of ligand-mCherry and receptor-eGFP.

But the confocal is showing no green. So perhaps the eGFP is not expressed. Why?

Looking at the options, D says the receptor and eGFP are not in the frame. So if the ORF is not in frame, the eGFP would not be correctly expressed. But the construct was designed with fusions, so the stop cassettes are correctly placed, and after excision, the receptor would be followed by eGFP in frame. If the frame is wrong, the eGFP wouldn't be made. So in that case, you wouldn't see any eGFP.

But in the Western blot, they used antibodies against the overexpressed proteins, which would detect the receptor (if the eGFP is not expressed, maybe the Western would show only the receptor, not the fusion). Wait, but in the vector, the receptor is fused to eGFP. If the fusion is out of frame, the eGFP wouldn't be expressed, but the receptor might be. But the Western blot showed a signal proportional to actin loading, so perhaps the receptor is expressed, but the eGFP is not.

So in the mouse, when Cre is active, the receptor-eGFP should be expressed. If it's not, maybe the construct wasn't properly excised, or the eGFP isn't being made. 

But the question is why no green signal. So which option would lead to no eGFP expression despite Cre being active?

Option D: the receptor and eGFP are not in the frame. If the ORF is not in frame, the eGFP won't be expressed, so no green signal. So in the Western, only the receptor would be detected, but in the mouse, the eGFP is not, hence no green.

Alternatively, if the stop cassettes weren't excised, but the question says the mouse was crossed with SOX10-Cre, implying that Cre is active in the right cells. So the stops would be excised, allowing expression.

Wait, another possibility: the plasmid transfection was in astrocytes, but the mouse construct is in the germline. So in the mouse, the construct is under the same regulation. But if the vector is correctly designed, the Cre should excise the stops in the neural crest cells. So in those cells, the eGFP should be expressed, leading to green fluorescence.

So why no green? If the eGFP isn't being expressed, maybe because the fusion is not in frame. So option D would be the reason.

Alternatively, option B: the receptor-eGFP is stuck in the Golgi. That would prevent it from being on the cell surface, so in live imaging, you wouldn't see the GFP. But in the Western blot, you might see the protein, but maybe not. If it's retained in the Golgi, the Western would show it, but the live cell imaging wouldn't. So in the mouse, the construct is correctly expressed but not at the cell surface, hence no fluorescence.

Wait, what's the difference between the Western and live imaging? The Western would use cell lysates, so it would detect the protein regardless of where it is in the cell. So in the Western, the eGFP would be detected if it's expressed, but the live imaging would only show surface expression.

But the question states that in the Western blot, they tested the construct expression after plasmid transfection. So in the transfected cells, the eGFP should be expressed. But in the mouse, perhaps the construct is correctly inserted, but the eGFP isn't expressed because of a frame shift. Alternatively, the Cre wasn't active, so the stops weren't excised. But the mouse was crossed to SOX10-Cre, so in neural crest-derived cells, Cre should be active.

Wait, another thought: the vector is a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. The lox sites are different: loxP and lox2272. Cre recognizes loxP sites, but lox2272 is a variant that is recognized by Cre but with a different recombination outcome. So perhaps the lox sites are incompatible. For example, if you have a loxP site upstream and a lox2272 downstream, Cre might not recognize both, or the recombination might not happen correctly.

Wait, but the ligand has a loxP-stop, and the receptor has a lox2272-stop. So when Cre is present, it would excise the loxP site, allowing ligand-mCherry to be expressed. But the lox2272 site requires a different Cre variant, like Dre, for recombination. Wait, no, lox2272 is a mutated version of the loxP site. It can be recombined by Cre but requires more specific conditions. For example, Cre can recombine lox2272 sites but only when paired with another lox2272 or a loxP. Hmm, I'm a bit fuzzy on this.

Alternatively, I'm not sure about the specifics of lox2272. But assuming that Cre can recognize both lox sites, but the two sites are different, perhaps when Cre recombines, it doesn't excise both stops. Or maybe, in the vector, the lox sites are arranged such that Cre can only excise one of them, leaving the other in place.

Wait, the ligand has a loxP-stop, and the receptor has a lox2272-stop. So when Cre is introduced, it should recognize the loxP site and excise the stop, allowing ligand-mCherry to be expressed. But the lox2272 site is not recognized by Cre unless paired with another lox2272, perhaps. Or maybe it requires a different Cre variant. If that's the case, the lox2272 stop is not excised, so the eGFP isn't expressed.

But in the question, the mouse is crossed to SOX10-Cre, which is a regular Cre. So if the lox2272 site isn't recognized by Cre, then the receptor's stop isn't excised, so eGFP isn't expressed. Thus, no green signal.

So why would the lox2272 site not be recognized? Because Cre can't recognize it, or perhaps it requires a different Cre, like Dre, which is a different recombinase. So if the vector has lox2272 sites, and the Cre is regular Cre, then the lox2272 sites don't get excised. So the eGFP wouldn't be expressed.

But the ligand's stop is in a loxP cassette, so that would get excised. So ligand-mCherry would be expressed, but receptor-eGFP would not, because the lox2272 stop isn't excised.

So in the Western blot, the ligand would be expressed, and the receptor might not be because the stop is still in place. Wait, no, the IRES is after the ligand. Wait, the vector is ligand under CBA, then IRES, then receptor with stop and eGFP. So without the stop being excised, the receptor is not expressed. But the Western blot shows expression, so maybe the ligand is expressed, but the receptor isn't. But in the mouse, the SOX10-Cre is expressed, so the ligand and receptor should both be expressed.

Hmm, maybe I'm getting stuck on the vector design. Let me recap:

Vector setup:
5' - CBA promoter driving ligand ORF - stop cassette (loxP) - mCherry - IRES - receptor ORF - stop cassette (lox2272) - eGFP - 3'

Wait, no, the ligand is 5', then IRES, then receptor. The ligand is fused to mCherry, but between them is a stop cassette. So the actual structure is:

Ligand ORF (with CBA promoter) followed by a loxP-stop-loxP cassette, then mCherry. Then comes IRES, then receptor ORF, followed by a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette, then eGFP.

Wait, no, that can't be. Because the ligand is at 5' and fused to mCherry. So perhaps the vector is:

Ligand ORF (with CBA) - stop (loxP) - mCherry - IRES - receptor ORF (stop lox2272) - eGFP.

So the ligand is expressed, then the stop is in the way. Cre would excise the loxP, allowing the ligand-mCherry to be expressed. Similarly, the receptor is followed by a stop in a lox2272 cassette. So Cre would excise that, allowing receptor-eGFP to be expressed.

But if the lox2272 sites aren't recognized by Cre, then the stop isn't excised, so receptor-eGFP isn't expressed.

So why would Cre not recognize lox2272? Because the Cre used is a standard Cre, and lox2272 requires a different Cre variant, like Dre, or perhaps specific conditions.

In that case, when the mouse is crossed with SOX10-Cre, the loxP sites are recombined, but the lox2272 sites are not. So the ligand-mCherry would be expressed, but the receptor-eGFP wouldn't be.

But the question is about the eGFP not being expressed. So the construct would have the ligand expressed but not the receptor. But in the mouse, the neural crest cells would express the ligand but not the receptor, so the eGFP wouldn't be there. Thus, no green signal.

Alternatively, the vector is set up so that both stops are excised when Cre is present. But if the lox sites are incompatible, only one stop is excised.

Wait, but the vector was designed with the ligand under CBA and the receptor under IRES. So the IRES allows the receptor to be expressed as a separate ORF. But without the stop being excised, the receptor can't be expressed.

So if the lox2272 stop isn't excised, then the receptor isn't expressed. So in the mouse, the Cre is active, but the lox2272 isn't recognized, so the receptor isn't expressed. Therefore, no eGFP.

So why is the lox2272 stop not excised? Because the Cre used doesn't recognize it. That would be the case if the lox2272 is a variant that requires a different Cre.

So looking at the options, none of them directly address the lox site incompatibility. Let's see the options again.

Option D: the receptor and eGFP are not in the frame. That would prevent the eGFP from being expressed correctly. So in the Western, the receptor would be detected, but eGFP wouldn't. But the question says the Western shows the signal proportional to actin loading, which is a control. So that suggests that the proteins are expressed.

Wait, the Western blot was done after transfecting the plasmid into astrocytes. So during that, the stop cassettes would have been excised if Cre was present. But in the plasmid, perhaps the Cre wasn't provided. Wait, the question says the vector is a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. So does the vector include the Cre under a promoter?

Wait, the vector is a lox-Cre vector, which usually contains the Cre gene. So when the vector is transfected, Cre is expressed, which excises the lox sites. So in the plasmid transfection in astrocytes, Cre would be expressed, excising the stops, leading to expression of both mCherry and eGFP. Hence, in the Western, the overexpressed proteins (probably the ligand and receptor) would be detected, and the eGFP would be expressed.

But in the mouse, the construct is inserted into the genome, but unless the Cre is provided, the stops remain. So the mouse is homozygous for the construct, which includes the lox sites and stops. Then, when crossed with SOX10-Cre mice, the Cre is active in neural crest cells, which should excise the lox sites.

So why no green? Let's go back to the options.

Option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. So when the stop is excised, the ORF would be receptor followed by eGFP, but if they're not in frame, the eGFP isn't made. So no eGFP expression.

So in the Western blot, perhaps the receptor is detected, but the eGFP isn't. But the question says the Western blot shows a signal proportional to actin, suggesting the proteins are expressed.

Wait, the ligand is under CBA, so when the plasmid is transfected, the ligand is expressed, along with the receptor. But in the mouse, without the Cre, the stops are still in place, so the ligand and receptor are expressed as separate proteins, not the fusion with mCherry and eGFP.

Wait, the vector is designed as a bicistronic construct. So in the absence of Cre, the ligand is expressed as a fusion with mCherry, but only if the stop is excised. Wait, no, without Cre, the stop is in place. So the ligand is expressed, but the mCherry isn't. Similarly, the receptor is expressed, but the eGFP isn't. So in the plasmid transfection, the researcher would see the ligand and receptor on Western, but not the mCherry and eGFP. But in the presence of Cre (like in the mouse after crossing with SOX10-Cre), the stops are excised, allowing the fusion proteins to be expressed.

But in the mouse, the Cre is active in the neural crest cells, so the ligand-mCherry and receptor-eGFP should be expressed, leading to green fluorescence. But in the confocal, no green is observed.

So why? If the eGFP is not expressed, which could be due to the frame being wrong (option D), so in the mouse, the eGFP isn't made, hence no green.

Alternatively, if the enhancer is missing, then the CBA promoter isn't active, so the ligand and receptor aren't expressed. But the Western blot showed expression, so probably the promoter is working.

Another possibility is that the eGFP is expressed but not functional, but that's unlikely to cause no signal.

Wait, another thought: the vector is designed such that in the presence of Cre, the ligand and receptor are co-expressed, but perhaps the ligand-receptor interaction leads to internalization or degradation. But the question is about the expression, not the function.

Alternatively, perhaps the eGFP is expressed but not fluorescent because it's not on the cell surface. But in that case, the Western would detect it, but live imaging wouldn't. So the Western would show a band for eGFP, but the confocal wouldn't show green.

But the question says that in the mouse, the construct is in the genome and crossed with Cre, leading to no green. The Western blot after transfection showed the proteins were expressed, but it's unclear whether eGFP was detected. The question only says the signal is proportional to actin, suggesting that the proteins are expressed, but perhaps not the eGFP.

So looking again at the options, option D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. So when Cre excises the stop, the receptor is expressed but eGFP isn't, leading to no fluorescence.

In that case, the Western would detect the receptor but not the eGFP. But the question says the Western shows a signal proportional to actin, which is a loading control. So maybe the blot detected the receptor, but not eGFP. Alternatively, the blot may have detected the ligand, not the eGFP. It's a bit unclear.

Another option: the enhancer for the ligand and receptor is missing. But the CBA promoter is strong. Maybe the enhancer is necessary for expression in specific cells. If the enhancer is missing, then in the mouse, the ligand and receptor aren't expressed in the right cells. But the plasmid transfection would express them regardless of enhancers, so the Western would show expression.

But in the mouse, without the enhancer, the ligand and receptor aren't expressed, so no eGFP. But the question states that the mouse is homozygous for the construct, meaning the enhancer must be present in the vector.

Hmm. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this. The key point is that the eGFP isn't expressed. The most likely reason is that the eGFP isn't in frame, so option D is correct.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves a bicistronic lox-Cre vector expressing a ligand fused to mCherry and a receptor fused to eGFP. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, and the receptor is under an IRES regulatory element. Stop cassettes with loxP and lox2272 sites prevent expression of the fusion proteins in the absence of Cre. Upon Cre excision, the stop cassettes are removed, allowing expression of ligand-mCherry and receptor-eGFP. The mouse model is homozygous for the construct and crossed with SOX10-Cre mice, where Cre is expressed in neural crest cells, enabling excision of the stop cassettes and expected eGFP expression. However, no green signal is observed under confocal microscopy. The possible reasons are analyzed as follows:

1. **Option A: Ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship**  
   This option suggests that the ligand and receptor act on different cells. However, the question focuses on the expression of the eGFP-tagged receptor in the same cell, not the functional relationship between ligand and receptor. This does not explain the lack of eGFP expression.

2. **Option B: The receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi**  
   If the receptor-eGFP were retained in the Golgi, it would not reach the cell surface, preventing detection by confocal microscopy. However, the Western blot detects total proteins, including those retained in the Golgi. Since the Western blot showed expression, this is unlikely to be the reason.

3. **Option C: The enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing**  
   The CBA promoter is a strong constitutive promoter, and the IRES element ensures independent expression of the receptor. The construct was tested in astrocytes, where expression was confirmed. The enhancer is not critical here, as the promoters are functional. Thus, this option is unlikely.

4. **Option D: The receptor and eGFP are not in the frame**  
   If the receptor and eGFP are not in the same reading frame, the eGFP would not be correctly expressed. This would result in no eGFP fluorescence in the confocal microscope, consistent with the observation. The Western blot would detect the receptor but not the eGFP, aligning with the described results.

The most likely explanation is that the receptor and eGFP are not in the correct reading frame, preventing eGFP expression and fluorescence. 

**Answer: D**
