Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this enthalpy of neutralization problem. Hmm, let me think. The question says I've got three solutions being mixed: HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2. I need to calculate the enthalpy change when they're all mixed together.

Wait, I remember that enthalpy of neutralization is usually calculated per mole of acid reacting with a base. And the formula is often based on strong acids and strong bases, releasing a certain amount of heat, like around -57 kJ/mol. But wait, sometimes it's given in calories, like 40 calories per mole or something? Or was it kilocalories? Oh, right, sometimes it's expressed as -57 kJ per mole, which is 13.68 kcal/mol because 1 kcal is about 4.184 kJ. Wait, no, wait: 1 kcal is 4184 J, so 57,000 J is about 13.6 kcal. But wait, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify: 1 kJ is 1000 J, 1 kcal is 4184 J. So 57 kJ is 57,000 J, which is 57,000 /4184 ≈13.6 kcal. So the enthalpy per mole is about -13.6 kcal.

But first, I need to find out how much acid and base is reacting here. Wait, but the problem has three solutions. Let me think about the reaction. HCl is a strong acid, H2SO4 is a strong acid too, but Ba(OH)2 is a strong base.

Wait, when you mix an acid with a base, they neutralize each other. So I guess I need to find the total moles of H+ from the acids and the total moles of OH- from the base, then see which is in excess.

So let's calculate the moles of each:

1. HCl: 500 mL is 0.5 L. Molarity is 0.2 M, so moles = 0.5 L * 0.2 mol/L = 0.1 moles. HCl is a strong acid, so it dissociates completely, giving 0.1 moles H+.

2. H2SO4: 300 mL is 0.3 L. Molarity is 0.3 M. So moles = 0.3 L *0.3 =0.09 mol. H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, but since it's a strong acid, it'll donate 2 H+ per molecule. So 0.09 mol H2SO4 gives 0.18 mol H+.

So total H+ from HCl and H2SO4 is 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 mol.

3. Ba(OH)2: 200 mL is 0.2 L. Molarity is 0.5 M. Moles = 0.5 *0.2 =0.1 mol Ba(OH)2. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base and dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2 OH-. So each mole gives 2 mol OH-. So 0.1 mol *2 =0.2 mol OH-.

So now, comparing H+ and OH-:

H+ available: 0.28 mol

OH- available: 0.2 mol.

So OH- is the limiting reactant. So all 0.2 mol OH- will react, and H+ will have 0.28 - 0.2 = 0.08 mol left, which is in excess.

Wait, but wait: in neutralization, H+ reacts with OH- in a 1:1 ratio. So the reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O.

So the moles that react are 0.2 mol H+ and 0.2 mol OH-.

The enthalpy change is based on how many moles of H+ and OH- have reacted. So the total moles of neutralization is 0.2 mol.

Now, assuming that each mole of H+ and OH- reacting releases a certain amount of heat. But wait, H2SO4 is a diprotic acid. But in the first neutralization, each mole of H2SO4 gives 2 H+ ions. So for the first H+ (the first dissociation), it's considered a strong acid, but what about the second H+? I think H2SO4 is a strong acid for the first H+ (H2SO4 → 2H+ + SO4^2-?), No, wait, no. Wait, actually, H2SO4 is a strong acid for the first dissociation: H2SO4 → 2H+ + SO4^2-? Or is it that it only donates one H+ initially and the second is weaker? Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, H2SO4 is a strong acid, but it's diprotic. The first dissociation is complete: H2SO4 → 2H+ + SO4^2-? Or wait, no. Actually, the first H+ is completely ionized, but the second may not be. Wait, no, when H2SO4 is in solution, it dissociates as H2SO4 → 2H+ + SO4^2- in aq. Wait, no, I think that's incorrect. H2SO4 is a strong acid for the first proton, but the second H+ comes from the hydrogen sulfate ion, which is a weak acid. Wait, no, wait, actually, in dilute solutions, H2SO4 behaves as a strong acid for the first proton. The second dissociation (HSO4- → H+ + SO4^2-) is not complete, but in concentrated solutions, it's more complicated. But in this problem, since it's a neutralization reaction with a strong base, Ba(OH)2, perhaps we can assume that both H+ from H2SO4 are available for neutralization.

Wait, but Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so maybe the neutralization will proceed with all available H+ and OH- until one is exhausted. So in the calculation, I think I can proceed as I did before, considering all H+ from HCl and H2SO4, regardless of their source.

But wait, perhaps the enthalpy of neutralization is per mole of H+ and OH- reacting. So each mole of H+ and OH- produces about 13.6 kcal of heat (exothermic, so negative).

Wait, but another thing: the neutralization of a strong acid with a strong base is typically around -57 kJ per mole of H+ (or OH-) reacting, which is about -13.6 kcal per mole.

Wait, 57,000 J is 57 kJ, which is 57,000 / 4184 ≈13.6 kcal. So each mole of H+ and OH- reacting releases about 13.6 kcal.

So in this case, 0.2 moles of H+ and OH- are reacting. So the enthalpy change would be 0.2 * (-13.6 kcal) ≈ -2.72 kcal.

But wait, wait a minute. What about the fact that H2SO4 is diprotic? Each mole gives two H+ ions. So I'm mixing that in. So when I have 0.09 moles of H2SO4, it contributes 0.18 moles of H+. Plus 0.1 from HCl, making 0.28 H+.

Ba(OH)2 gives 0.2 moles of OH-.

So 0.2 moles of H+ and OH- will react, producing 0.2 moles of water. So the enthalpy change is 0.2 * (-57 kJ) = -11.4 kJ. Wait, but the options have kcal and kJ. Let me check the options again.

The options are:

A) -2.72 kcal

B) -11.42 kcal

C) -3.80 kcal

D) -16.0 kJ

Wait, so if I calculate in kJ, 0.2 * (-57) = -11.4 kJ. But option D is -16.0 kJ. Hmm, that's not matching. Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate in kcal, so 0.2 * (-13.6) ≈-2.72 kcal. Which is option A.

Wait, but why the discrepancy between kJ and kcal? Because the problem might be using different units. Let me think: the enthalpy of neutralization for strong acids and bases is approximately -57 kJ per mole, which is about -13.6 kcal per mole.

So if 0.2 moles react, that's 0.2 * (-57) = -11.4 kJ, which is about -2.72 kcal. So the answer would be A, or D if in kJ. But looking at the options, A is -2.72 kcal and D is -16.0 kJ. So which unit is the problem expecting?

The question doesn't specify, but the options have both. So perhaps I need to pick the correct unit. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, but maybe the enthalpy per mole is given differently. For example, is it per mole of acid or per mole of H+?

Wait, the standard enthalpy of neutralization is per mole of acid reacting with a base, but for diprotic acids, each mole provides two H+ ions. So for H2SO4, one mole provides two H+, so each mole would contribute two times the enthalpy. So perhaps in that case, the total neutralization would be calculated based on the acid and base equivalents.

Wait, another approach: find the equivalents (eq) of acid and base.

Equivalents = moles * valence.

For HCl: 0.1 moles HCl → 0.1 eq H+.

For H2SO4: 0.09 moles H2SO4 → 0.18 eq H+ (since each mole gives 2 H+).

Total eq H+ is 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 eq.

For Ba(OH)2: 0.1 moles Ba(OH)2 → 0.2 eq OH- (each mole gives 2 OH-).

So the OH- is the limiting reactant, as before. So the neutralization will proceed with 0.2 eq.

Each equivalent of H+ and OH- reacting releases approximately 13.6 kcal (from the 57 kJ per mole, since 57 kJ is about 13.6 kcal).

So 0.2 eq → 0.2 * 13.6 = 2.72 kcal, but since it's exothermic, it's -2.72 kcal. Which is option A.

So the answer should be A) -2.72 kcal.

Wait, but what about the possibility that H2SO4 is only providing one H+? Then, the H+ would be 0.1 +0.09 = 0.19 eq. But earlier, I thought that in solution, H2SO4 dissociates completely into 2 H+ and SO4^2-.

Wait, if H2SO4 is a diprotic acid and fully dissociates both H+ in solution, then it's 2 H+ per mole. So I think my initial calculation is correct.

So the correct answer is A.

To calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when 500 mL 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL 0.3 M H₂SO₄, and 200 mL 0.5 M Ba(OH)₂ are mixed, we proceed as follows:

1. **Determine the moles of H⁺ from the acids:**
   - **HCl:**  
     Moles of HCl = \( 0.5 \, \text{L} \times 0.2 \, \text{M} = 0.1 \, \text{mol} \).  
     Since HCl is a strong acid, it dissociates completely, contributing \( 0.1 \, \text{mol} \, \text{H}^+ \).

   - **H₂SO₄:**  
     Moles of H₂SO₄ = \( 0.3 \, \text{L} \times 0.3 \, \text{M} = 0.09 \, \text{mol} \).  
     H₂SO₄ is a diprotic acid, and both protons dissociate completely in this context, contributing \( 0.09 \, \text{mol} \times 2 = 0.18 \, \text{mol} \, \text{H}^+ \).

   - **Total H⁺ from acids:**  
     \( 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 \, \text{mol} \, \text{H}^+ \).

2. **Determine the moles of OH⁻ from the base:**
   - **Ba(OH)₂:**  
     Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = \( 0.2 \, \text{L} \times 0.5 \, \text{M} = 0.1 \, \text{mol} \).  
     Each mole of Ba(OH)₂ dissociates into 2 moles of OH⁻, so it contributes \( 0.1 \, \text{mol} \times 2 = 0.2 \, \text{mol} \, \text{OH}^- \).

3. **Determine the limiting reactant:**
   - The reaction between H⁺ and OH⁻ is \( \text{H}^+ + \text{OH}^- \to \text{H}_2\text{O} \), which occurs in a 1:1 molar ratio.  
   - Total H⁺ available = \( 0.28 \, \text{mol} \), and total OH⁻ available = \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \).  
   - OH⁻ is the limiting reactant, as it will be completely consumed, leaving \( 0.28 - 0.2 = 0.08 \, \text{mol} \, \text{H}^+ \) unreacted.

4. **Calculate the enthalpy change:**
   - The enthalpy of neutralization for strong acids and bases is approximately \( -57 \, \text{kJ/mol} \) (or \( -13.6 \, \text{kcal/mol} \)) per mole of H⁺ and OH⁻ reacting.  
   - Since \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \) of H⁺ and OH⁻ react, the enthalpy change is:  
     \[
     0.2 \, \text{mol} \times (-57 \, \text{kJ/mol}) = -11.4 \, \text{kJ}
     \]  
     Converting to kcal:  
     \[
     0.2 \, \text{mol} \times (-13.6 \, \text{kcal/mol}) = -2.72 \, \text{kcal}
     \]

5. **Select the correct option:**
   - The problem provides options in both kJ and kcal. The calculation in kcal gives \( -2.72 \, \text{kcal} \), which matches option A.

**Answer: A**
