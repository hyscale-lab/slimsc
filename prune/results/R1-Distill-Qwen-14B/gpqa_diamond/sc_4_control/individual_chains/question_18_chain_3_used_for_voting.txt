Okay, so I've got this problem here about stars and their elemental abundances. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think through it step by step.

Alright, the problem says there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their masses are 1.5 and 1.2 times that of the Sun, respectively. But wait, maybe the mass isn't directly relevant here since the question is about elemental abundances, which I think relates more to the composition of their photospheres rather than their mass. But I'll keep that in mind just in case.

The given abundances are [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex and [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex. Oh, and [Fe/H]_1 is 0, and [Mg/H]_2 is 0. The Sun's photosphere has 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 and 12 + log10(nMg/nH) = 7. I need to find the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So, I'm looking for [Si/Star_1] / [Si/Star_2] or maybe the ratio [Si_1/Si_2]?

Wait, no, the problem says the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres. So it's (n_Si1 / n_Si2). Or wait, maybe it's (n_Si1 / n_Si_sun) compared to (n_Si2 / n_Si_sun)? Because if I can find the abundance of Si in each star relative to the Sun, then the ratio would be (Star_1 Si / Star_2 Si).

Wait, but the question says "the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2." So I think it's (n_Si in Star1) divided by (n_Si in Star2). But wait, because in stellar atmospheres, we usually express abundances relative to hydrogen. So if I can find [Si/H] for each star, then I can get the ratio.

Wait, but how? Let's unpack the given data.

For Star_1:
[Fe/H]_1 = 0. That means the abundance of Fe relative to H is the same as in the Sun. Because [Fe/H] is log(nFe/nH) - log(nFe_sun/nH_sun). So if it's zero, their ratio is 1.

And [Si/Fe]_1 is 0.3. So the abundance of Si relative to Fe is higher by 0.3 dex. So [Si/Fe] is log(n_Si/n_Fe) - log(n_Si_sun/n_Fe_sun) = 0.3.

Wait, but since [Fe/H] is 0, the Fe abundance is the same as the Sun, so n_Fe1/n_H1 = n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun.

So for Star_1, n_Si1/n_Fe1 = (n_Si_sun/n_Fe_sun) * 10^0.3.

Because [Si/Fe] = 0.3 means n_Si1/n_Fe1 = 10^(0.3) * (n_Si_sun/n_Fe_sun).

But wait, in the Sun, the abundance of Fe is given as 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5. Wait, wait, the way I think it's usually expressed is that the log is of (n_X / n_H), with X being the element. So for the Sun, log(nFe/nH) = 7.5-12? No, wait, the formula might be 12 + log10(n_X/n_H) equals the given value. So for the Sun, for Fe, 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5. So log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5.

Wait, that can't be right. Because n_H is a huge number, so n_X/n_H should be small. So log(n_X/n_H) would be negative. So for Fe, log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 - 12 = -4.5. So nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5) ≈ 3.16e-5.

Similarly, for Mg in the Sun, 12 + log10(nMg/nH) =7, so log10(nMg/nH) =7-12= -5. So nMg/nH = 1e-5.

Wait, that makes sense because Mg is less abundant than Fe in the Sun. Wait, but maybe I'm getting the formula wrong. Let me think again.

Wait, the notation is [X/H] = 12 + log10(n_X / n_H). So [X/H] is like the logarithmic scale. For example, the Sun's [Fe/H] is 7.5. Wait, no, in the problem statement, the Sun's [Fe/H] is given as 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5. So that would imply that log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5. So nFe/nH = 1e-4.5 ≈ 3.16e-5.

Same for Mg: 12 + log10(nMg/nH) =7 → log10(nMg/nH) =7-12= -5 → nMg/nH =1e-5.

Now, for Star_1:

[Fe/H]_1 is 0. So log10(nFe1/nH1) - log10(nFe_sun/nH_sun) =0 → nFe1/nH1 = nFe_sun/nH_sun.

Which is 3.16e-5.

[Si/Fe]_1 is 0.3: [Si/Fe] = log10(nSi1/nFe1) - log10(nSi_sun/nFe_sun) = 0.3.

So nSi1/nFe1 = 10^0.3 * (nSi_sun/nFe_sun).

But what's the Sun's nSi/nFe? Since in the Sun, nSi is determined by the solar composition. Let me think: Wait, the Sun's [Si/Fe] is given as [Si/Fe]_1 =0.3? Wait no, the problem gives [Si/Fe]_1 and [Mg/Si]_2 as 0.3. Wait, no, for Star_1, [Si/Fe] is 0.3, and for Star_2, [Mg/Si] is 0.3.

But wait, the problem doesn't give [Mg/Si]_1 or [Si/Fe]_2, so maybe I need to find the [Si/H] for each star.

Wait, the approach should be: for each star, find the abundance of Si relative to H.

Let me start with Star_1.

For Star_1:

[Fe/H]_1 = 0 → nFe1/nH1 = nFe_sun/nH_sun =3.16e-5.

[Si/Fe]_1 =0.3 → log10(nSi1/nFe1) - log10(nSi_sun/nFe_sun) =0.3 → nSi1/nFe1 =10^0.3 * (nSi_sun/nFe_sun).

But wait, what is nSi_sun/nFe_sun? Let's compute that.

In the Sun, nFe_sun/nH_sun = 3.16e-5 → log10(nFe/nH) = -4.5.

Similarly, what about nSi/nH in the Sun? Let's see. The problem doesn't give it, so perhaps I need to express [Si/H] in terms of [Fe/H] and [Si/Fe].

Wait, [Si/H] = [Fe/H] + [Si/Fe].

Because [Si/H] = log10(nSi/nH) - log10(nSi_sun/nH_sun).

But [Fe/H] = log10(nFe/nH) - log10(nFe_sun/nH_sun) =0, so nFe/nH = nFe_sun/nH_sun.

Hmm, perhaps another approach: Let's express nSi1 as a function of nFe1 and then nH1.

nSi1 = nFe1 * (nSi1/nFe1) = nFe1 * 10^{0.3} * (nSi_sun/nFe_sun).

But nFe1 = nFe_sun * (nH1 /nH_sun) ) *10^{[Fe/H]_1}.

Wait, [Fe/H]_1 =0 → nFe1/nH1 = nFe_sun/nH_sun → nFe1 = nFe_sun * nH1 /nH_sun.

So, substituting back:

nSi1 = (nFe_sun * nH1 /nH_sun) ) * 10^{0.3} * (nSi_sun /nFe_sun) )

Simplify: nSi1 = nH1 /nH_sun * 10^{0.3} * nSi_sun.

But nSi_sun is (nSi_sun/nH_sun) *nH_sun → nSi_sun = (nSi_sun /nH_sun) *nH_sun.

Wait, perhaps a better way is to compute [Si/H]_1.

Because [Si/H]_1 = [Fe/H]_1 + [Si/Fe]_1 = 0 + 0.3 =0.3.

So the abundance of Si relative to H in Star_1 is 0.3 dex higher than in the Sun.

Wait, but how? Because [X/H] is the logarithm of the ratio of X to H relative to the Sun. So for Star_1, [Si/H]_1 = 0.3 → log10(nSi1/nH1) - log10(nSi_sun/nH_sun) ) =0.3 → log10(nSi1/nH1) = log10(nSi_sun/nH_sun ) +0.3.

So nSi1/nH1 = (nSi_sun/nH_sun ) *10^0.3.

But wait, since nH1 is not the same as nH_sun, because stars have different pressures? Hmm, but I think in this context, the [X/H] is defined as the logarithm of the number density relative to the Sun's, so the ratio is expressed as:

n_X1 /n_H1 = 10^{ ([X/H]_1) } * (n_X_sun /n_H_sun ).

Wait, no, because [X/H] = log10(n_X /n_H) - log10(n_X_sun /n_H_sun) ) → which is log10( (n_X /n_H ) / (n_X_sun /n_H_sun ) ) )

So n_X /n_H = (n_X_sun /n_H_sun ) * 10^{ [X/H] }

So for Star_1, [Si/H]_1 =0.3 → nSi1/nH1 = (nSi_sun/nH_sun ) *10^0.3.

Similarly, for Star_2, perhaps we can find [Si/H]_2.

Wait, let's look at Star_2's data. They have [Fe/H]_2 =0? No, wait, the problem says [Fe/H]_1=0 and [Mg/H]_2=0. Oh, wait, Star_2's [Mg/H] is 0. So for Star_2, [Mg/H]_2=0 → nMg2/nH2 =nMg_sun/nH_sun=1e-5.

And [Mg/Si]_2=0.3 → [Mg/Si]_2 = log10(nMg2/nSi2) - log10(nMg_sun/nSi_sun) ) =0.3.

So nMg2/nSi2 = 10^0.3 * (nMg_sun /nSi_sun).

But nMg2 = nMg_sun * nH2/nH_sun.

Hmm, but I need to find [Si/H]_2.

Wait, perhaps express [Si/H] in terms of [Mg/H] and [Mg/Si].

Because [Mg/Si] is given, and [Mg/H] is 0.

So [Mg/Si] = log( (nMg/nSi) / (nMg_sun/nSi_sun) ) ) =0.3.

So (nMg2/nSi2) = 10^0.3 * (nMg_sun /nSi_sun).

But in Star_2, [Mg/H]_2=0 → nMg2/nH2 =nMg_sun/nH_sun → nMg2 = (nMg_sun/nH_sun ) *nH2.

So substituting into the [Mg/Si] equation:

nMg2 /nSi2 = 10^0.3 * (nMg_sun/nSi_sun )

→ (nMg_sun/nH_sun * nH2) /nSi2 = 10^0.3 * (nMg_sun/nSi_sun )

Multiply both sides by nSi2 and divide by (nMg_sun/nH_sun *nH2):

nSi2 = [ (10^0.3 * nMg_sun * nSi_sun ) / (nMg_sun) ) ] * (nH2)/(nH_sun )

Wait, perhaps this is getting complicated. Let me think another way.

Let me write [Mg/Si]_2 =0.3.

Which implies that:

log( (nMg2/nSi2) / (nMg_sun/nSi_sun) ) ) = 0.3.

So,

nMg2/nSi2 = 10^{0.3} * (nMg_sun /nSi_sun ).

But I also know that [Mg/H]_2=0 → nMg2 = nMg_sun * (nH2 /nH_sun ).

So substituting into the above equation:

(nMg_sun * (nH2 /nH_sun )) /nSi2 = 10^{0.3} * (nMg_sun /nSi_sun )

Cancel out nMg_sun from both sides:

nH2 /nH_sun /nSi2 = 10^{0.3} /nSi_sun.

Multiply both sides by nSi2 and by nH_sun:

nH2 = 10^{0.3} * (nSi2 /nSi_sun ) * nH_sun.

But the left side is nH2, and nH2 is the number of hydrogen atoms in Star_2.

Hmm, but I need to find [Si/H]_2. Which is:

log( (nSi2/nH2) / (nSi_sun/nH_sun) ) ) = [Si/H]_2.

So,

nSi2/nH2 = (nSi_sun/nH_sun ) * 10^{ [Si/H]_2 }

So, substituting nH2 from earlier: nH2 = 10^{0.3} * (nSi2 /nSi_sun ) *nH_sun.

Wait, let's plug this into nSi2/nH2:

nSi2/nH2 = nSi2 / [10^{0.3} * (nSi2/nSi_sun ) *nH_sun ]

= [nSi2 * nSi_sun ] / [10^{0.3} * nSi2 * nH_sun ]

= nSi_sun / (10^{0.3} * nH_sun )

So,

nSi2/nH2 = (nSi_sun /nH_sun ) * (1 /10^{0.3} )

Which means that:

nSi2/nH2 = (nSi_sun/nH_sun ) * 10^{-0.3}.

Which implies that [Si/H]_2 = log10( (nSi2/nH2 ) / (nSi_sun/nH_sun ) ) ) = log10( 10^{-0.3} ) = -0.3.

Hmm, that's interesting. So [Si/H]_2 is -0.3. So the abundance of Si in Star_2 is 0.3 dex less than in the Sun.

Wait, so for Star_1, [Si/H]_1 is 0.3, and for Star_2, [Si/H]_2 is -0.3.

So the ratio of silicon in Star_1 to Star_2 is (n_Si1 / n_Si2 ) = (n_Si1 /n_H1 ) * (n_H2 /n_Si2 ) * (n_Si2/n_H2 ) / (n_Si1/n_H1 )

Wait, maybe a better approach is to compute (n_Si1 /n_Si2) = (n_Si1/n_H1 ) / (n_Si2/n_H2 ) ) * (n_H1 /n_H2 )

Wait, but that's getting complicated. Alternatively, because the ratio is (n_Si1 /n_H1 ) / (n_Si2 /n_H2 ) ) → [Si/H]_1 - [Si/H]_2.

Wait, [Si/H] is log(n_Si/n_H) - solar value. So [Si/H]_1 =0.3, [Si/H]_2 =-0.3.

So the ratio (n_Si1/(n_Si_sun )) ) / (n_Si2/(n_Si_sun )) ) = (n_Si1 /n_Si2 ) = 10^{ [Si/H]_1 } / 10^{ [Si/H]_2 } }.

Wait, because [X/H]_star = log(n_X/n_H) - log(n_X_sun/n_H_sun ) → so n_X/n_H = (n_X_sun/n_H_sun ) *10^{ [X/H]_star }

So for Star_1:

n_Si1/n_H1 = (n_Si_sun/n_H_sun) * 10^{0.3 }

Star_2:

n_Si2/n_H2 = (n_Si_sun/n_H_sun) *10^{-0.3 }

We want the ratio (n_Si1/n_Si2 ) = (n_Si1/n_H1 )/(n_Si2/n_H2 ) ) * (n_H1/n_H2 )

Wait, no, that's not correct. Because (n_Si1/n_Si2 ) = (n_Si1/n_H1 ) * (n_H2/n_Si2 )

Wait, but I'm not sure about the n_H terms. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to express the ratio as:

(n_Si1 /n_Si2 ) = (n_Si1 /n_H1 ) / (n_Si2 /n_H2 ) ) * (n_H2 /n_H1 )

Wait, but I don't have the ratio of n_H1 and n_H2. Hmm, perhaps that's a problem.

Wait, but in stellar atmospheres, the number density of H can vary, but perhaps the ratio of H in the two stars is not needed because the ratio of Si would be in terms of their [Si/H].

Wait, perhaps the ratio of Si is (n_Si1 /n_Si2 ) = (n_Si1/n_H1 )/(n_Si2/n_H2 ) ) * (n_H1 /n_H2 )

But that's tricky because I don't know n_H1 and n_H2.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio is simplifies to (n_Si1/n_Si2 ) = (n_Si1/n_H1 ) * (n_H2/n_Si2 )

Wait, this is getting a bit confusing. Let me think again.

I have:

n_Si1 = (n_Si_sun/n_H_sun ) *10^{0.3} *n_H1

n_Si2 = (n_Si_sun/n_H_sun ) *10^{-0.3} *n_H2

So the ratio n_Si1/n_Si2 = [10^{0.3} *n_H1 ] / [10^{-0.3} *n_H2 ]

= 10^{0.6} * (n_H1 /n_H2 )

But wait, I don't know n_H1 and n_H2. Unless there's another way to relate them.

Wait, but maybe the ratio n_H1/n_H2 is 1? That can't be assumed, though. Because the stars have different masses, so perhaps their surface gravities are different, leading to different number densities.

But wait, the problem doesn't give any information about the surface gravity or pressure, which would determine n_H. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating things and the ratio of H cancels out.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps the ratio of silicon is (n_Si1 / n_Si2 ) = ( [Si/H]_1 - [Si/H]_2 ) in log space, which would be 0.3 - (-0.3) = 0.6. So 10^0.6 ≈3.98, which is about 3.9 or 4.

Wait, but that would be the case only if all other factors are equal, which they're not. Because the ratio also depends on the ratio of H in the two stars. So perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, another approach: the ratio (n_Si1/n_Si2 ) = (n_Si1/n_H1 ) / (n_Si2/n_H2 ) ) * (n_H1/n_H2 )

But from the [X/H] expressions, (n_Si1/n_H1 ) = (n_Si_sun/n_H_sun ) *10^{0.3}

Similarly, (n_Si2/n_H2 ) = (n_Si_sun/n_H_sun ) *10^{-0.3}

So,

(n_Si1/n_Si2 ) = [ (10^{0.3} ) / (10^{-0.3}) ) ] * (n_H2 /n_H1 )

= 10^{0.6} * (n_H2 /n_H1 )

So the ratio depends on the ratio of n_H2 to n_H1.

But I don't have any information about the number of hydrogen atoms in each star. So perhaps I'm missing something here.

Wait, but the problem states that the stars are in LTE (Local Thermal Equilibrium) and elemental abundances are determined via the EW method. But perhaps the problem expects us to assume that the number of hydrogen atoms is the same, but that doesn't make sense because stars have different sizes and pressures.

Hmm, maybe I should think in terms of the ratio of silicon to hydrogen, which is what [Si/H] represents, and perhaps the ratio of silicon atoms is [Si/H]_1 divided by [Si/H]_2.

But wait, no, because [Si/H] is a logarithmic measure, it's not the actual ratio. So the ratio is 10^{ [Si/H]_1 - [Si/H]_2 }.

Which would be 10^{0.3 - (-0.3)} = 10^0.6 ≈3.98, which matches option A (~3.9).

But does this account for the hydrogen ratio? Because I've assumed n_H1 =n_H2, which might not be correct.

Wait, maybe the problem is intended to be solved this way, considering that the ratio is indeed 10^{0.6}, so approximately 3.98, which is option A.

So, after this long thinking process, I'll go with option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2, we analyze the given elemental abundances and use the logarithmic abundance scale defined as \([X/H] = \log_{10}(n_X / n_H) - \log_{10}(n_X^{\odot} / n_H^{\odot})\), where \(n_X\) and \(n_H\) are the number densities of the element \(X\) and hydrogen, respectively, and the subscript \(\odot\) denotes solar values.

### Step 1: Analyze Star_1
For Star_1:
- \([Fe/H]_1 = 0\), meaning the Fe abundance relative to hydrogen is the same as in the Sun.
- \([Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3\), which implies \(\log_{10}(n_{Si1} / n_{Fe1}) - \log_{10}(n_{Si}^{\odot} / n_{Fe}^{\odot}) = 0.3\).
- Using \([Si/H] = [Fe/H] + [Si/Fe]\), we find \([Si/H]_1 = 0 + 0.3 = 0.3\).

Thus, the silicon abundance in Star_1 relative to hydrogen is:
\[
\frac{n_{Si1}}{n_{H1}} = \left(\frac{n_{Si}^{\odot}}{n_{H}^{\odot}}\right) \cdot 10^{0.3}.
\]

### Step 2: Analyze Star_2
For Star_2:
- \([Mg/H]_2 = 0\), meaning the Mg abundance relative to hydrogen is the same as in the Sun.
- \([Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3\), which implies \(\log_{10}(n_{Mg2} / n_{Si2}) - \log_{10}(n_{Mg}^{\odot} / n_{Si}^{\odot}) = 0.3\).
- Rearranging, \(\frac{n_{Mg2}}{n_{Si2}} = 10^{0.3} \cdot \frac{n_{Mg}^{\odot}}{n_{Si}^{\odot}}\).

Using \([Mg/H]_2 = 0\), we know \(\frac{n_{Mg2}}{n_{H2}} = \frac{n_{Mg}^{\odot}}{n_{H}^{\odot}}\). Substituting this into the equation for \([Mg/Si]_2\), we solve for \([Si/H]_2\):
\[
\frac{n_{Si2}}{n_{H2}} = \frac{n_{Si}^{\odot}}{n_{H}^{\odot}} \cdot 10^{-0.3}.
\]
Thus, \([Si/H]_2 = -0.3\).

### Step 3: Calculate the Ratio of Silicon Atoms
The ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 to Star_2 is given by:
\[
\frac{n_{Si1}}{n_{Si2}} = \frac{\frac{n_{Si1}}{n_{H1}}}{\frac{n_{Si2}}{n_{H2}}} = \frac{\left(\frac{n_{Si}^{\odot}}{n_{H}^{\odot}}\right) \cdot 10^{0.3}}{\left(\frac{n_{Si}^{\odot}}{n_{H}^{\odot}}\right) \cdot 10^{-0.3}} = 10^{0.3 - (-0.3)} = 10^{0.6}.
\]
Approximating \(10^{0.6} \approx 3.98\), the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2 is approximately **3.9**.

### Final Answer:
The ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2 is **~3.9**.
