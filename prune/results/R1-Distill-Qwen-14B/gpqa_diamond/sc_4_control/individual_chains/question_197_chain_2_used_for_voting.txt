Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let's see what it's about. The question involves identifying a compound based on its IR and NMR data and then determining the product after a reaction with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm, I remember that red phosphorus and HI are usually involved in some kind of elimination or substitution reaction, maybe a Hoffman type? Or wait, isn't that more for amides? Oh wait, wait! Red phosphorus with HI is often used in the hydrolysis of nitriles. Or wait, no, that's concentrated H2SO4 and water. Hmm. Maybe it's more about dehydrohalogenation or something else. Alternatively, I'm thinking about the possibility of a substitution reaction, perhaps an aromatic substitution. Alternatively, maybe it's a cleavage reaction.

But first, I need to figure out what compound X is. Let's look at the IR and NMR data.

The IR data: 3400–2500 cm-1. That broad region could be O-H (like an alcohol or carboxylic acid) or maybe an amide N-H. But wait, also, the peaks at 1720 and 1610. 1720 is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Could be a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or acid. The peak at 1610 could be aromatic C=C stretching. The 1450 cm-1 might indicate some conjugation or possibly a carbonyl adjacent to something else. Wait, another peak around 1450 might be a C-O stretch, like in an ester or an aromatic ring with substituents.

Looking at the NMR data to get more clues. The 1H NMR shows:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): That's a broad singlet. Could be an aldehyde proton, but aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10 ppm. But wait, a broad singlet might be an acidic proton like a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, an alcohol's -OH would be broad, but in D2O it would exchange and disappear, but sometimes it shows up as a broad peak. But in this case, the integration is 1H, so maybe a phenolic OH? Or wait, the next peak is 8.0 ppm, which is in the aromatic region.

But wait, 10.5 is a high chemical shift. For a carboxylic acid, the -OH proton is broad and around 10-12 ppm. So maybe that's a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, an aldehyde is around 9-10, but a broad peak might not fit that. Let me think: if the compound has a carboxylic acid group, the IR would show a broad O-H stretch around 3000-2500, and a strong carbonyl around 1720. So that fits. The IR does have 3400–2500, which could include the O-H stretch. So, maybe the compound is a benzoic acid derivative.

Looking at the other NMR signals:

8.0 ppm (d, 2H): That's typical for a para-substituted aromatic ring. The doublet suggests coupling with adjacent protons. So maybe two protons on adjacent carbons. Like in a para-disubstituted benzene, each set of two protons would be a doublet.

7.2 ppm (d, 2H): Also in the aromatic region, another doublet. So this is the classic case of a para-substituted benzene ring with two substituents.

Wait, so for example, if the benzene has two substituents in the para positions, each with two protons. So, for instance, if the substituents are in the 1 and 4 positions. Wait, but that's a single substituent. Wait, no, if the substituent is para, then each substituent is in one position, but in this case, the NMR shows two sets of doublets. So perhaps the benzene ring is substituted with two groups, each in para positions relative to each other. Or wait, perhaps it's a di-substituted benzene with substituents that are para to each other. Let me think of another structure. Oh, wait, maybe the benzene ring has substituents at positions 1 and 4, but each substituent doesn't have protons. Or maybe the substituents are in such a way that each set of H is a doublet.

Wait, perhaps the benzene ring has two substituents that are in positions 1 and 4 (para), but each substituent has two protons adjacent. Like a para-dimethyl group? No, because dimethyl would cause more splitting. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are -CH2 groups or something else.

Wait, let me think of the NMR more carefully. The 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H) could represent a 1,4-disubstituted benzene, where each substituent is in a position that causes this splitting. For example, if the substituent is a -CH2- group or something that splits the aromatic protons into a doublet.

Wait, another thought: the substituent could be a ketone or an ester. Because we have a carbonyl in the IR. So maybe the benzene ring has a carbonyl group in one position, and another substituent in the para position.

Wait, but the IR has a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl, probably from a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or acid. If it's a carboxylic acid, the O-H would be broad, which we've considered. So maybe the compound is a benzoic acid with another substituent.

Looking at the other NMR peaks:

2.9 ppm (m, 1H): That's a multiplet. Maybe a CH group adjacent to something, like a CH connected to an electronegative group or part of a larger chain.

1.7 ppm (m, 2H): Another multiplet, perhaps a CH2 group adjacent to something, maybe a branched chain.

1.4 ppm (d, 3H): A triplet of 3H as a doublet? No, wait, a doublet of 3H. That's probably a CH(CH3) group. Because a CH with two substituents would split into a doublet. Wait, but the integration is 3H. Wait, no, the integration is 3H, which would be a methyl group attached to something. Wait, a doublet integrating 3H would mean that the CH3 is connected to a CH that is next to something else. For example, in isopropyl groups, the methyl groups are split by the CH. Alternatively, maybe it's a CH(CH3)2 group, but in that case, the splitting would be a septet or something else. Alternatively, maybe it's a methyl group attached to a CH that is itself next to another group. Wait, the 1.4 ppm is a doublet, 3H. So perhaps a CH3 attached to a CH that has another substituent, like in a branching. So maybe a group like CH(CH3)2.

Wait, another possibility: the 1.4 ppm as a doublet (d) for 3H could be a CH3 group attached to a CH that is part of a larger structure. Like in an isobutyl group. Let me think: if we have a group like -CH(CH2CH2CH3)CH3, but the splitting would be more complex. Alternatively, perhaps it's a CH(CH3) group attached to something else, like a benzene ring.

Wait, let's think of the structure. If the benzene ring has a substituent that is a side chain, perhaps an ethyl group or propyl group. Let me try to piece this together.

So, looking at the NMR data, the aromatic region suggests a para-substituted benzene. Let's say substituents are in positions 1 and 3? No, wait, that's meta. Wait, in a 1,4-disubstituted benzene, the aromatic protons would typically split into two doublets. For example, if the substituents are in the 1 and 4 positions, and the substituent in position 1 is a group that deshields the adjacent hydrogens, and similarly for position 4.

Wait, another approach: Let me list all the possible groups in the NMR.

- 10.5 ppm (1H, broad): Probably a carboxylic acid -COOH proton. That would make sense with the IR showing a broad O-H around 3400–2500. Wait, wait, but a carboxylic acid would have a very strong O-H stretch around 2500–3300, and the IR shows that. So that fits. So the compound has a carboxylic acid group.

Wait no, wait. The broad singlet at 10.5 could also be an aldehyde proton, but that's usually a bit upfield, but I've heard that sometimes they can be broader. Alternatively, a phenolic OH would be about 5 ppm, so that's less likely. So more likely a carboxylic acid.

Then, the aromatic protons: 8.0 (d, 2H) and 7.2 (d, 2H). That's typical of a para-substituted benzene, where the substituent is in the para position, causing the adjacent hydrogens to be split into doublets. So the substituent in the para position would cause the neighboring hydrogens to each be a doublet.

So, the substituent is likely a strong electron-withdrawing group, such as a carbonyl (like a ketone, aldehyde, or carboxylic acid). Alternatively, it could be an electron-donating group, but in that case, the aromatic protons would have different shifts.

Wait, if the substituent is a carbonyl group, like a ketone, then the adjacent protons would be deshielded and appear downfield. So, if the substituent is in the para position, the two protons adjacent would be at around 8.0 and 7.2 ppm.

Wait, but if the substituent is a carbonyl, like a ketone, then the protons adjacent would be more deshielded. Alternatively, if it's a carboxylic acid, the substituent is -COOH, but that's a strong electron-withdrawing group. So the adjacent protons would be deshielded, hence appear downfield.

But wait, the substituent could be at position 4, so the ring is 4-carboxyphenyl, and then another substituent elsewhere? Or perhaps the substituent is a side chain.

Wait, but the NMR also shows a CH group at 2.9 ppm (m, 1H). That suggests perhaps a CH connected to something, maybe a chain leading to the aromatic ring.

Wait, let me think of the structure. Maybe it's a benzene ring with a substituent like -COOH at position 4, and another substituent which is an isopropyl or similar group.

Wait, the 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) could be a methyl group attached to a CH which is itself attached to another group. So, perhaps, the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH3) group or something like that. Wait, but wait, the 1.4 ppm is a doublet for 3H, so that might be a CH3 attached to a CH which is split into a doublet. So maybe it's a CH(CH3) group where the CH is connected to another CH2 group.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH3)2 group. Wait, not sure. Let me try to build the structure.

Alternatively, the substituent could be a propyl group, but that might not fit the NMR.

Another approach: let's look at the options given. The options are:

A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid

B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene

C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid

D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene

So let's analyze each option.

Option A: 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid. So the structure would be CH2CH2COOH attached to the benzene ring at position 2. Wait, no, 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid would be CH2CH2COOH attached to the benzene at position 4? Wait, no. Maybe the structure is Ph-CH2-CH2-COOH, where Ph is 4-ethyl. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps it's phenylpropanoic acid, with the substituent at position 4. But I'm getting a bit confused. Let me visualize each option.

Option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So the benzoic acid is at position 4, and the substituent is a sec-butyl group. Benzoic acid is -COOH at position 1, and the sec-butyl group is at position 4.

Wait, sec-butyl is CH2CH(CH2CH3), but no, wait, sec-butyl is CH(CH2CH3)CH2-? Wait, no, let me correct. The structure of sec-butyl is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-. Wait, no, wait: the structure of isobutyl is CH2CH(CH3)2, while sec-butyl is CH2CH(CH2CH3). Wait, no, I think I might be getting this wrong. Let me recall: butyl groups can be straight chain or branched. The 'sec' refers to the position of substitution. So, the structure of sec-butyl is CH2CH2CH(CH3), but that's not right. Wait, no: the correct structure for sec-butyl is CH2CH(CH2CH3), but wait, that's not possible. Let me think again. Wait, butyl groups have four carbons. The possible isomers are: n-butyl (straight chain), iso-butyl (where the branching is on the second carbon, so CH(CH2CH3)2?), and sec-butyl, which is CH2CH(CH2CH3)CH2-? No, that's not possible because you can't have a CH2 after branching without another carbon. Wait, perhaps sec-butyl is -CH2CH(CH2CH3)CH2-. No, that would be a longer chain. Alternatively, perhaps it's -(CH2)2CH(CH3). Wait, no. Maybe I'm getting this wrong, but perhaps it's better to look at the options again.

Looking at option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So the benzoic acid is at position 4. Wait, no, the numbering might be different. Benzoic acid is in position 1, and the substituent is at position 4.

So the structure would be:

Benzoic acid (-COOH) at position 1, and a sec-butyl group at position 4.

Wait, but that would be 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, which is option C.

Now, let's see what the NMR would look like for this structure.

Benzoic acid would have a proton at around 10-11 ppm, which is what the 10.5 ppm peak is. Then, the aromatic protons would be in a para-substituted pattern. Let's imagine the benzoic acid is at position 1 and the sec-butyl group is at position 4.

The aromatic protons would be in positions 2,3,5,6. But wait, in a para-substituted benzene, the substituents are in positions 1 and 4. So the protons in positions 2 and 6 would be equivalent, and those in 3 and 5 would be equivalent. Let me think: for para-substituted benzene, the protons are in two sets of doublets, each integrating to 2H. So in the NMR, we have 8.0 (d, 2H) and 7.2 (d, 2H), which matches the data.

So, the aromatic protons would correspond to this structure. Then, the substituent is a sec-butyl group. Let's think about the substituent's NMR.

The substituent is a sec-butyl group, which is CH2CH(CH2CH3)2? No, wait, I'm getting confused. The structure of sec-butyl is CH2CH(CH2CH3) but that can't be right because that would only be three carbons. Wait, maybe it's CH(CH2CH2CH3) but that's not correct. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a branch at the second carbon.

Wait, the correct structure of sec-butyl is CH2CH(CH2CH3)CH2- but that doesn't make sense. Wait, the correct structure is -(CH2)2CH(CH3)-, but that's actually a iso-butyl group. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting the substituents mixed up.

Wait, but let's think about the substituent in option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. The substituent is a sec-butyl group attached to the benzene at position 4. So the substituent would be: -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-. Wait, that's not right because that's a four-carbon group. Wait, perhaps the substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH3)2.

Wait, perhaps the substituent's structure is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-, but that doesn't make sense because that would be a five-carbon chain. I think I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to think of the substituent's NMR.

In option C, the substituent is a sec-butyl group. So, the substituent would have a structure like CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-.

Wait, but wait. The substituent in option C is a -sec-butyl group attached to the benzene. So the substituent is CH2CH(CH2CH3)CH2-? No, that would be a five-carbon chain. Alternatively, perhaps it's -(CH2)2CH(CH3)-. No, that's iso-pentyl or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a branching with a methyl group. Let me think about the NMR of the substituent.

The NMR data has peaks at 2.9 (m, 1H), 1.7 (m, 2H), 1.4 (d, 3H), and 0.9 (t, 3H).

So, the 0.9 ppm triplet (3H) suggests a terminal methyl group, probably part of an ethyl chain. The 1.4 ppm doublet (3H) suggests a methyl group attached to a CH that's next to something else. The 1.7 ppm (2H, m) is likely a CH2 group next to a branching point, and the 2.9 ppm (1H, m) is a CH that's connected to other groups.

Putting this together, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH3)CH2- group. Wait, but let me build the structure. So, the substituent is perhaps a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group. No, that can't be right. Let me think again.

Wait, the substituent could be a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the substituent could be a -CH(CH2CH3)CH2- group.

Wait, let's try to model the NMR data for the substituent.

We have:

- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): This is a terminal methyl group, probably in an ethyl chain. So this would be the end of an ethyl group, like CH2CH3.

- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): These are likely two protons in a CH2 group adjacent to another CH2 or a branching point.

- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): A methyl group attached to a CH that is adjacent to something else. So, perhaps a CH(CH3) group, where the CH is next to another CH2.

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): A CH group that's connected to other groups, perhaps adjacent to the branching.

Putting this together, the substituent might be a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- group, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps it's a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is an isobutyl group. Let me think: an isobutyl group is CH2CH(CH3)2. So, the structure would be:

-CH2-CH(CH3)2.

In that case, the NMR would show:

The CH3 groups attached to the central CH would split into a septet, but I don't see that in the data. Alternatively, perhaps it's a sec-butyl group, which is CH2CH(CH2CH3).

Wait, that doesn't seem right, but let me consider the substituent as -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-. Then, the end of the chain would have a CH3 group attached to a CH, which is connected to a CH2, which is connected to the benzene.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a pentyl group, but that's probably not the case.

Alternatively, the substituent could be a propyl group with a methyl branch. Let me think: perhaps it's a -CH(CH2CH3)CH2- group attached to the benzene.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group, but that would require more carbons.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH3)2 group, which would be isobutyl. Then, the NMR would show the CH(CH3)2 as a septet for the CH2 groups, but in our data, the peaks are at 1.4 (d, 3H) and 0.9 (t, 3H), which might fit.

Wait, let's model the isobutyl group's NMR. An isobutyl group is CH2CH(CH3)2.

The structure would be:

CH2-CH(CH3)2.

The CH3 groups on the central CH would each have a triplet from coupling with the CH2. The CH2 would be a quintet. But wait, in the given NMR data, the 0.9 ppm is a triplet, which would fit the terminal CH3 of an ethyl group. Then, the 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) would be the methyl groups attached to the central CH. So, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)2 group, i.e., an isobutyl group.

Wait, but in that case, the NMR would have:

The CH2 groups attached to the central CH (the CH2 next to the benzene) would be a triplet, integrating 2H. The CH(CH3)2 group would have a septet for the CH, but that's not present here. Alternatively, perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group, but that would require a longer chain.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH3)CH2- group, but that would be a longer chain.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck. Let me think back to the NMR data.

The substituent's NMR shows a triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H), which is likely a methyl group at the end of a chain, like CH2CH2CH3.

Then, the 1.7 ppm (2H, m) would be a CH2 group adjacent to that.

The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is a methyl group attached to a CH, which is itself adjacent to another group.

The 2.9 ppm (1H, m) is a CH group connected to other groups.

Putting this together, the substituent might be a -CH(CH2CH2CH3)- group, but that would require branching.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a -CH(CH2CH3)-CH2- group.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group. No, that adds too many carbons.

Wait, another approach: The substituent's NMR shows a triplet at 0.9, which is 3H, so likely a CH3 at the end of a chain, probably an ethyl group. The 1.7 ppm (2H) would be a CH2 adjacent to that. The 1.4 ppm (3H, d) would be a methyl group attached to a CH, which is connected to the CH2 group.

So, the substituent would be a -CH2-CH(CH3)- group, but that's only three carbons. Wait, that would make the substituent a propyl group with a methyl branch.

Wait, that would be a -CH2-CH(CH3)- group attached to the benzene. Then, the full structure would be benzene with a substituent -CH2-CH(CH3)COOH? No, wait, the benzoic acid is at position 4. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- group, making it a butyl group. But that would be a straight chain.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is an ethyl group (CH2CH3) attached to a CH(CH3) group. So, the structure would be CH2CH(CH3)CH2- attached to the benzene.

But I'm getting stuck on the exact structure. Let me look at the options again.

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

If the substituent is a sec-butyl group, which is -CH2CH(CH2CH3), then the substituent would have a structure like CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- attached to the benzene.

Wait, but that's a four-carbon group: benzene-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-.

Wait, but that would make the substituent a pentyl group, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-, which would be a four-carbon substituent.

But let's think about the NMR of that substituent.

The substituent would have:

- The terminal CH3 (from CH2CH3) would be at 0.9 ppm as a triplet.

- The adjacent CH2 would be next to that, perhaps at 1.7 ppm as a quartet.

- The CH(CH2CH3) would be at around 2.9 ppm as a multiplet.

- The CH2 attached to the benzene would be at around 1.4 ppm as a doublet.

Wait, but in the NMR data, the 1.4 ppm is a doublet (3H), which would be a methyl group attached to a CH. So that doesn't fit; perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group. But that would have a longer chain.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH3)CH2- group, making it a isoamyl group. Hmm, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps I should consider another approach. Let's think about the reaction. The compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I remember that red phosphorus and HI can be used in the hydrolysis of nitriles to form amines, but that's in the presence of water, perhaps. Alternatively, I think that when a nitrile is treated with red phosphorus and HI, it undergoes a substitution reaction to form an amine. Wait, but what's the reaction of a carboxylic acid with red phosphorus and HI?

Wait, wait, red phosphorus and HI are also used in the Bayer-Villiger oxidation, but that's for ketones. Alternatively, I'm more familiar with HI being a strong acid and a good nucleophile. So perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution.

Wait, but if the substituent is a -COOH group, then under what conditions would that react with HI and red phosphorus? Alternatively, perhaps the substituent isn't a carboxylic acid but something else, like an ester. Let me think again.

Wait, looking back at the IR, the 1720 cm-1 is a strong peak, which could also be an ester carbonyl. But then, the O-H would be from an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: the IR peak at 1720 could be a ketone, and the 3400-2500 could be an alcohol's O-H stretch. But let's consider that.

If the compound is a ketone with an alcohol group, then the IR would have both. But the NMR has a broad peak at 10.5 ppm, which is more likely a carboxylic acid than an alcohol.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to figure out the structure again.

The given NMR data includes a peak at 10.5 ppm (1H, broad), which I believe is a carboxylic acid proton. So, the compound X is a benzoic acid derivative.

The substituent on the benzene ring is probably a side chain that includes a methyl group, perhaps leading to a branching.

In option C, 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, the substituent is a sec-butyl group. Let me think about the structure of the substituent and its NMR.

The substituent is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- attached to the benzene.

Wait, that would make the substituent:

benzene-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-.

Then, the NMR would show:

- The CH3 at the end (from CH2CH3) would be a triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H).

- The adjacent CH2 would be a quartet at around 1.6 ppm (2H).

- The CH(CH2CH3) would be a septet at around 2.5 ppm (1H), but wait, that's not matching the data.

Hmm, in the given data, the CH groups are at 2.9 ppm and the methyl groups at 1.4 ppm, which doesn't fit with this.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is not a straight chain but has a branching. Let me think of a substituent like -CH(CH2CH2CH3)-CH2- attached to the benzene. No, that's getting too complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH3)CH2- group, making it an isobutyl group. Wait, the isobutyl group is CH2CH(CH3)2. So, the substituent would be benzene-CH2-CH(CH3)2.

Then, the NMR would show:

- The two methyl groups on CH(CH3)2 would split into a septet for the CH group, but that's not present in the data.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)CH2- group. Wait, that would be a pentyl group with a branch, but I'm not sure.

Hmm, perhaps I should consider that the substituent is a propyl group with a methyl branch, leading to a specific NMR pattern.

Wait, another approach: The NMR has a peak at 2.9 ppm (1H, m), which is a CH group. The 1.7 ppm (2H, m) is a CH2. The 1.4 ppm (3H, d) is a CH3 attached to a CH, which is attached to the CH2. The 0.9 ppm (3H, t) is a CH3 at the end of an ethyl chain.

Putting this together, the substituent is a -CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2- group attached to the benzene. Wait, that would be a pentyl group with a branch.

But that would make the substituent benzene-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-.

Wait, but that doesn't match any of the options. Looking back, option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, which would have a substituent of -CH2CH(CH2CH3).

Hmm, perhaps the substituent's NMR would show:

- The terminal CH3 (from CH2CH3) as triplet at 0.9.

- The adjacent CH2 as a quartet around 1.6.

- The CH(CH2CH3) as a septet around 2.5.

But in our data, the 2.9 is a multiplet, not a septet. So perhaps that's not it.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck. Let me think about the reaction again.

The reaction is with red phosphorus and HI. I think that this is a reaction that cleaves an acid chloride to an acid, but in this case, the starting material is a carboxylic acid.

Wait, red phosphorus and HI can also be used to convert a nitrile into an amine, but that's not directly relevant here. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a hydrolysis of an ester.

Wait, but if the starting compound is a benzoic acid, then reacting it with HI and red phosphorus might not do much, unless it's a different functional group.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting compound isn't a carboxylic acid but an ester or a nitrile. But the NMR suggests a carboxylic acid.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a ketone. Let me think again. If the substituent is a ketone, then the 1720 cm-1 could be the carbonyl. But then, the broad peak at 10.5 ppm would need to be explained. Could it be an alpha-proton to a carbonyl? No, those are usually around 2-3 ppm. Alternatively, maybe an aldehyde proton, but that's around 9-10 ppm, but not as broad as a carboxylic acid.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to look at the options again.

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. Let's imagine the structure is:

Benzoic acid at position 1, and a sec-butyl group at position 4.

The substituent is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- attached to the benzene.

The NMR of this substituent would include:

- The CH3 at the end (CH2CH3) as a triplet (0.9 ppm, 3H).

- The adjacent CH2 as a quartet (around 1.7 ppm, 2H).

- The CH(CH2CH3) as a septet (around 2.9 ppm, 1H).

But in the given NMR data, the 2.9 ppm is a multiplet, not a septet. So perhaps this isn't matching.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. The substituent could be a -CH(CH3)CH2- group. Then, the NMR would show:

- The CH3 as a doublet at 1.4 ppm (3H).

- The adjacent CH would be at 2.9 ppm (1H, m).

- The next CH2 would be at 1.7 ppm (2H, m).

- The terminal CH3 would be at 0.9 ppm (3H, t).

That fits perfectly with the substituent being a -CH(CH3)CH2- group attached to the benzene.

So, the substituent would be a CH2CH(CH3) group, making it a iso-butyl group. Wait, that would be an iso-butyl group, which is -CH2CH(CH3)2.

Wait, no, iso-butyl is -CH2CH(CH3)2, but that would require two methyl groups on the same carbon.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a sec-butyl group, which is -CH(CH2CH3)CH2-.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the substituent structures. Let me clarify:

- n-butyl: -CH2CH2CH2CH3

- iso-butyl: -CH(CH3)CH2CH3

- sec-butyl: -CH2CH(CH2CH3)

Wait, no, that's not correct. The correct structures are:

- n-butyl: -CH2CH2CH2CH3

- iso-butyl: -CH(CH3)2CH2-

No, wait, iso-butyl is actually -CH2CH(CH3)2.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure for iso-butyl is -CH2CH(CH3)2.

So, the substituent in option C is a sec-butyl group, which would be -CH(CH2CH3)CH2-.

But I'm not confident in this. Let me instead think about the NMR data for each option.

Option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

So, the substituent is a sec-butyl group at position 4.

The substituent would be:

Ph-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-.

Wait, but that would be a pentyl group, but I'm getting stuck on the structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)CH2- group. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a methyl branch. So, for example, the substituent would be:

Ph-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3.

In that case, the NMR would show:

- The terminal CH3 (from CH2CH3) as a triplet at 0.9 ppm.

- The adjacent CH2 as a quartet at around 1.7 ppm.

- The CH(CH3) as a multiplet at around 2.9 ppm.

- The CH3 attached to the CH would be a doublet at 1.4 ppm.

That matches the given NMR data.

So, the substituent is a CH(CH3)CH2CH3 group attached to the benzene.

Wait, but that would be an iso-pentyl group, which is -(CH2)2CH(CH3)2, but that's not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps it's:

Ph-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3.

But that would be a pentyl group with a methyl branch, which might not match the options.

Wait, but the options include option C as 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So, if the substituent is a sec-butyl group, which is -(CH2)2CH(CH3), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a methyl branch, such as:

Ph-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH3.

Wait, but that would be a butyl group with a branch.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's proceed.

Assuming the structure is benzoic acid with a substituent that leads to the NMR data given.

Once I've identified the structure, the reaction with red phosphorus and HI will give the product.

If X is a benzoic acid derivative, what would happen when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI?

Wait, red phosphorus and HI can be used in the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids, but X is already a carboxylic acid, so that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps X is an ester.

Wait, but in the NMR data, the 10.5 ppm peak is a broad singlet, which is more consistent with a carboxylic acid than an ester.

Wait, another possibility: the reaction could be a substitution where a leaving group is replaced. But if X is a benzoic acid, perhaps it's the acid itself reacting.

Alternatively, perhaps X isn't a carboxylic acid but a nitrile. Let me think again.

If X is a nitrile, then IR would have the CN stretch around 2200 cm-1, which isn't present. So that's not the case.

Hmm, perhaps the reaction is a cleavage of an ester group. Let me think.

Wait, another possibility: the reaction could be a dehydration or elimination. But with red phosphorus and HI, it's more likely a nucleophilic substitution.

Wait, perhaps X is a tertiary or secondary alkyl halide. But the NMR doesn't show any peaks that would indicate that.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a carboxylic acid, and the reaction is a decarboxylation. But I can't recall red phosphorus and HI causing decarboxylation.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a cleavage of the benzoic acid's side chain.

Wait, but I'm stuck. Let me think of the options again.

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. If X is this compound, and it reacts with red phosphorus and HI, then what would happen?

Wait, if the substituent is a sec-butyl group, which is perhaps a good leaving group, but I don't think red phosphorus and HI are strong enough to remove it.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction involves the benzoic acid group.

Wait, another possibility: the reaction could be a hydrolysis of an ester to a carboxylic acid, but the data suggests X is already a carboxylic acid.

Wait, maybe X is an acid chloride, but the NMR and IR don't fit that.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think of the reaction conditions again.

Red phosphorus and HI are used in the hydrolysis of nitriles to produce amines. The reaction is:

R–CN + PRed + HI → R–NH2 + other products.

But if X is a nitrile, then after hydrolysis, we'd get an amine.

But the NMR data for X includes a peak at 10.5 ppm, a broad singlet, which doesn't fit a nitrile (which typically has a peak around 2 ppm for the CH2 groups adjacent to the nitrile). So perhaps X isn't a nitrile.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where a leaving group is replaced by something else.

Hmm, perhaps the reaction is an elimination, but I'm not seeing the leaving group in the structure.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a bromine or other halide, but the NMR doesn't show any peaks indicative of that.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the cleavage of an ester group to form a carboxylic acid. But if X is already a carboxylic acid, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the reaction is a reduction. For example, reducing a ketone to a secondary alcohol. But the IR doesn't show peaks for a ketone, unless I'm misinterpreting.

Wait, the IR has a peak at 1610 cm-1, which could be C=C aromatic, and 1450 cm-1, possibly for C-O stretching.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a Hoffman elimination, but that's for amides.

I'm starting to think that maybe X is a nitrile, but the NMR doesn't fit that. Alternatively, perhaps X is an ester.

Wait, but the IR shows a strong peak at 1720, which could be an ester. The 3400–2500 cm-1 could be an O-H from an alcohol, but in an ester, the O-H is not present. So perhaps the 3400–2500 is from an aldehyde or a carboxylic acid.

Hmm, maybe I should proceed under the assumption that X is option C, 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, and then determine the product after reaction with red phosphorus and HI.

If X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, then what would happen when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI?

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a cleavage of the sec-butyl group. But I'm not sure how that would proceed.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a decarboxylation, but I'm not certain about the conditions.

Wait, another thought: red phosphorus and HI are used in the production of alkenes from alcohols via the Hiyama reaction, but that's not directly applicable here.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent undergoes a substitution reaction. If the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3), and perhaps the CH2 is a leaving group, but I don't see how.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a reduction, but I don't see any functional groups that would be reduced.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation, but that's a different set of conditions.

Hmm, I'm stuck on both the structure and the reaction. Let me try to think differently.

If the substituent is a -COOH group, and the reaction is with HI and red phosphorus, perhaps the reaction is a decarboxylation to form an alkane.

Wait, for example, when a carboxylic acid is heated with a strong acid like HI, it can decarboxylate to form CO2 and an alkane. But I'm not sure about the role of red phosphorus here.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is part of an ester, and the reaction hydrolyzes it to a carboxylic acid. But X would already be a carboxylic acid.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the reaction is a cleavage of the benzoic acid side chain. For example, if the substituent is an ester, which upon hydrolysis would form a carboxylic acid, but that's not applicable here.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a nitrile, and the reaction converts it to an amine. But in that case, the IR would have a peak around 2200 cm-1, which it doesn't.

Hmm, perhaps the reaction is a reduction of the carbonyl group to a CH2 group. But without a reducing agent, I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: red phosphorus and HI can be used to convert nitriles into amines. But if X is a nitrile, I don't see the NMR peaks matching. Alternatively, perhaps X is a nitrile, but the given NMR doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps X is an ester, and the reaction converts it into a carboxylic acid. But again, the data suggests a carboxylic acid.

I'm getting stuck, so perhaps I should proceed with the best assumption I have.

Based on the NMR and IR data, I think X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C). Now, what would happen when this reacts with red phosphorus and HI?

If X is a benzoic acid with a substituent that's a sec-butyl group, perhaps the reaction cleaves the substituent.

Wait, another thought: the reaction could be a hydrolysis of the substituent. For example, if the substituent is a nitrile, it would hydrolyze to an amine. But again, the NMR and IR don't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a bromide or another leaving group, and the reaction replaces it. But I don't see any peaks in the NMR indicating a leaving group.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a methyl group attached to a CH that's adjacent to a leaving group, which is replaced by HI.

But without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the benzoic acid remains and the substituent is modified.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -COOEt (ester), and the reaction hydrolyzes it to a carboxylic acid, but X is already a carboxylic acid.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about the options again for the reaction.

Looking at the options, option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, and when reacted, what product could form.

If the reaction is a decarboxylation, perhaps the product would be 4-sec-butyl benzene (option D).

Wait, option D is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene, but that's a toluene derivative.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction removes the carboxylic acid group, leaving a benzene ring with the substituent.

Wait, but if X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, and the reaction decarboxylates it, the product would be 4-sec-butyl benzene (but that's not an option).

Looking at the options after the reaction:

Option D is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. Which would be a toluene derivative with a sec-butyl group in the para position.

Wait, but that implies that the benzoic acid group is replaced by a methyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction converts the carboxylic acid into a methyl group. But I'm not sure how that would happen.

Wait, another possibility: the reaction could be a reduction of the carboxylic acid to a methyl group. But I don't think red phosphorus and HI would do that.

Hmm, I'm not confident about the reaction outcome. Perhaps I should think of the reaction conditions again.

Red phosphorus and HI are used in the hydrolysis of nitriles to form amines. The reaction is:

R–CN + H3PO3 + HI → R–NH2 + other products.

But if X isn't a nitrile, this doesn't apply.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a chloro compound, and the reaction is a substitution to form an amine. But I'm not seeing chloro in the data.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a cleavage of the benzoic acid side chain to form a benzene ring with a methyl group.

But I'm not sure.

Another approach: perhaps the reaction with red phosphorus and HI leads to the cleavage of the substituent, releasing CO2 and forming a benzene ring with a methyl group.

But that would require the substituent to be attached via a carbonyl, which it's not.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group, and the reaction breaks it to form a methyl group.

But without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to say.

Given the time I've spent, perhaps I should make an educated guess.

Based on the NMR and IR data, I think the starting compound is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C). When this reacts with red phosphorus and HI, which are strong reducing agents, perhaps the benzoic acid is reduced to a methyl group.

But I'm not certain about the exact reaction. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction cleaves the substituent, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction converts the benzoic acid into a benzyl group, but I'm not certain.

Looking at the options after the reaction, option D is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene, which is a toluene derivative with a sec-butyl group.

If the benzoic acid group (-COOH) is replaced by a methyl group (-CH3), perhaps through some reduction, then the product would be toluene with a substituent.

But I'm not sure about the exact mechanism.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction removes the carboxylic acid group, leaving a benzene ring with the substituent.

In that case, the product would be 4-sec-butylbenzene, but that's not one of the options. The options after reaction are options A-D, which are all possible products.

Alternatively, another possibility: the reaction is a cleavage of the benzoic acid into a benzene ring with a methyl group. But then, the substituent would remain.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group, and the reaction shortens it to a methyl group. But again, without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to say.

Given the options, and considering the starting material as option C, which is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, and the reaction conditions, perhaps the product is option D, 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.

But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps the product is option A, 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid.

Wait, but that would involve a different substituent.

Hmm, I'm not sure. It's possible that the correct answer is option C, and the reaction doesn't change it, but that's unlikely.

Given all this, I think the correct answer is option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, and the reaction doesn't change it, but that's not one of the options after reaction. Wait, no, the question is to identify the product after reaction, so the starting material is X, which is option C, and the reaction produces another compound.

Wait, no, the options are the possible products. So the starting material X is not necessarily one of the options; the options are the possible products.

Wait, no, the question says that X has the given data, and reacts with red phosphorus and HI. The options are the possible products.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me restate: the starting material X is identified based on IR and NMR data, and then reacts to give one of the options.

So, I need to first determine what X is, then determine the product.

So, X is the compound with the given IR and NMR, and after reaction, the product is one of the options.

So, first, determine X.

Based on the IR and NMR data, X is a benzoic acid derivative with a substituent that leads to the NMR signals given.

I think X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C).

Now, the reaction with red phosphorus and HI.

If X is a benzoic acid, perhaps the reaction is a decarboxylation, which would remove the -COOH group, leaving a benzene ring.

But then, the substituent would remain. So, the product would be 4-sec-butylbenzene, but that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction cleaves the substituent, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a nitrile group, and the reaction converts it to an amine, but that doesn't align with the data.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is an ester. If X is an ester, then the reaction could hydrolyze it to a carboxylic acid. But the IR and NMR suggest X is already a carboxylic acid.

Hmm.

Alternative approach: perhaps the reaction is the cleavage of the substituent's chain.

If X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, and the reaction is a cleavage of the substituent, perhaps the product is 4-methylbenzoic acid. But that's not one of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group, and the reaction shortens it.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a reduction of the benzoic acid to a benzyl alcohol, but I'm not sure.

Hmm, I'm not making progress. Given the time I've spent, I'll make an educated guess.

Based on the given data, I think X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C). When reacted with red phosphorus and HI, perhaps the product is 4-(sec-butyl)benzene or some derivative, but this isn't an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction converts the -COOH group into something else.

Wait, another thought: the reaction could be a dehydration of the benzoic acid to form a benzene ring with a methyl group. But I'm not sure about the mechanism.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the -COOH group is replaced by a -CH2- group, leading to a different structure.

But without knowing the exact reaction mechanism, I'm stuck.

Given the options, I'll have to choose the most plausible product. Since X is a benzoic acid, perhaps the reaction doesn't change it, but that's not an option. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction converts the benzoic acid into a methyl group, leading to option D: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.

But I'm not confident. Another possibility is that the product is option A: 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid. But I don't see how the reaction would lead to that.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a cleavage of the substituent, leading to a shorter chain.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH3)2 group, and the reaction breaks off the CH(CH3)2, leaving a methyl group.

But without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to say.

In the end, I think the correct product is option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, but that's the starting material. Wait, no, the options are the possible products, so I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the product is option D: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.

But I'm not sure. Given the time I've spent, I'll proceed with option C as the starting material and assume the reaction doesn't change it, but that's not one of the product options.

Wait, perhaps I've made a mistake earlier. Let me reevaluate.

If the reaction is a substitution where the -COOH group is replaced by a -CH3 group, then the product would be 4-(sec-butyl)toluene, which is option D: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.

So, the product would be option D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves identifying a compound (Compound X) based on its IR and NMR data and determining the product formed after reacting with red phosphorus and HI. The IR data shows peaks at 3400–2500 cm⁻¹ (broad, likely O-H stretch), 1720 cm⁻¹ (strong carbonyl, C=O), 1610 cm⁻¹ (aromatic C=C), and 1450 cm⁻¹ (possibly C-O or conjugation). The NMR data includes a broad singlet at 10.5 ppm (likely a carboxylic acid proton), aromatic protons at 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H), and signals for a chain substituent at 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), and 0.9 ppm (t, 3H). These suggest a para-substituted benzene ring with a carboxylic acid group and a branched alkyl substituent.

### Analysis of Options:
1. **Option A: 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid**  
   This structure does not match the NMR data, as it would not produce the observed splitting pattern for the aromatic protons or the substituent chain.

2. **Option B: 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene**  
   This structure lacks a carboxylic acid group, which is indicated by the IR and NMR data. Additionally, it does not match the aromatic splitting pattern.

3. **Option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**  
   This structure fits the data well. The carboxylic acid group explains the broad singlet at 10.5 ppm and the IR carbonyl peak. The para-substituted benzene matches the aromatic NMR signals (8.0 ppm and 7.2 ppm). The substituent, a sec-butyl group, matches the NMR signals for the chain (2.9 ppm, 1.7 ppm, 1.4 ppm, and 0.9 ppm).

4. **Option D: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**  
   This structure lacks a carboxylic acid group, which contradicts the IR and NMR data. It also does not match the aromatic splitting pattern.

### Reaction with Red Phosphorus and HI:
The reaction conditions suggest a possible decarboxylation or substitution. For **Option C** (4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid), the carboxylic acid group could undergo decarboxylation, leaving a benzene ring with the sec-butyl substituent. However, none of the options directly match this product. Among the given options, **Option D** (1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene) is the most plausible product, assuming the reaction replaces the carboxylic acid group with a methyl group.

### Conclusion:
Based on the IR and NMR data, Compound X is identified as **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid** (Option C). After reacting with red phosphorus and HI, the product is most likely **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene** (Option D). 

Answer: D
