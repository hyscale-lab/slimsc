Okay, so I've got this problem about identifying an unknown compound based on its spectroscopic data. Let's break it down step by step.

First, the question mentions three characterization techniques: FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The goal is to determine the chemical formula from the given options.

Starting with the FTIR data. The very broad absorption around 3000 cm^-1 suggests an -OH group, maybe from an alcohol or carboxylic acid. But wait, if it's a carboxylic acid, the peak is usually broader and might appear a bit lower, but sometimes around 2500-3300. Another possibility is an alcohol, but alcohols have a broad peak too. Also, the presence of two strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. Hmm, 1700 is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch, like in a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe an acid. The 1650 peak could be another carbonyl group, or perhaps an aromatic ring with conjugation, or an amide. But since we're talking about the options given, which don't have nitrogen, maybe it's another carbonyl. Wait, wait, 1700 is a higher wavenumber, typical of maybe an ester or ketone. The 1650 could be an aromatic ring, like C=C stretching, but that's usually around 1600-1680. Alternatively, maybe it's a conjugated carbonyl group or an acid derivative.

Moving on to the NMR. There are several peaks, including some vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are those attached to a double bond, like in alkenes, so this suggests the compound has a double bond. The presence of vinyl protons in the NMR indicates that there's an alkene group somewhere in the structure.

Mass spectrometry shows a fragment peak at m/z=45. Let's think about possible fragments. 45 is a common mass. For example, it could be a CH3O group (mass 31 for CH3O would be 15+16+16=47? Wait, no. Wait, m/z 45 could be a fragment like (CH3)2O, which is 45 (12*2 + 1*6 + 16 = 46? Wait, 2 carbons: 24, 6 hydrogens:6, 16 oxygen: 46. Hmm, no. Alternatively, maybe a CH2O group? No, that's 30. Alternatively, 45 could be from a (CH3)2CO- group or something else. Alternatively, think about common fragments. Like, for esters, the loss of the R group could leave something. Another thought: 45 is the mass of CH3CO (which is 43? No, 12+16=28? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me calculate. CH3CO would be 2*12 (24) + 4*1 (4) + 16 (O) = 44. Oh, wait, but that's 44. So maybe it's another group. Alternatively, the fragment could be a methyl group attached to something else. Wait, maybe a COOCH3 group? No, that would be 91 (12*2+16*2+16+3*12+ etc. Hmm, perhaps I should think of the molecular formula first.

The possible options are:

A) C6H12O2
B) C6H10O
C) C6H10O2
D) C6H12O

Let's think about degrees of unsaturation for each option. Degrees of unsaturation = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Since no X or N is given, assuming X=0, N=0.

For A: C=6, H=12, O=2.
DOU = (2*6 +2 -12 -0)/2 = (14-12)/2 = 1. So one degree: could be a ring or a double bond.

For B: C6H10O. DOU = (14 -10)/2 = 2. So two degrees: could be a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds, or two rings.

C: C6H10O2. DOU = (14-10)/2 = 2. Two degrees.

D: C6H12O. DOU = (14-12)/2 = 1 degree.

Now, the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, so that's a double bond. So at least one degree is from a double bond. So any option with only one degree (A and D) must have a ring as well, or maybe just a double bond. Wait, but if the compound has a double bond, then the degrees must include that. Let's see.

Wait, the FTIR shows a peak at 1700 and 1650. If there are two carbonyl groups, like two C=O, that would explain those peaks. But wait, the first peak is 1700, which is typical for esters or ketones. The 1650 could be another carbonyl, perhaps conjugated, like an acid. Wait, but if the compound is an ester, it has one carbonyl. But maybe it's a diester or a ketone plus something else. Alternatively, one is a carbonyl and the other is an aromatic ring. Alternatively, perhaps the 1700 is a carbonyl and the 1650 is an aromatic C=C.

Wait, but in aromatic rings, the C=C stretch is usually around 1450-1600 cm^-1. Wait, 1650 is a bit higher, perhaps indicating conjugated carbonyl groups, like in a ketone with conjugated double bonds. Alternatively, maybe a conjugated carbonyl, like an alpha, beta-unsaturated ketone. So perhaps the compound has a ketone with a conjugated double bond.

But the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, which would mean a double bond. So, the structure could be something like an enone (conjugated ketone and alkene). But wait, let's think about the formula options.

Looking at the options:

Option C is C6H10O2. DOU is 2. So two degrees: could be a double bond and a ring, or two double bonds, etc.

If the structure has both a double bond and a ring, or two double bonds, that would make sense.

But let's get back to the mass spec. The fragment at m/z=45. Let me think about possible groups that would give 45. For instance, the fragment could be a (CH3)2CO- group. Wait, (CH3)2CO is acetone, which has a molecular weight of 58. Alternatively, maybe something else.

Another approach: the molecular ion. The molecular formula is one of the options. The mass spectrum's fragment at 45 could be a characteristic fragment. Let's think about each option.

Option A: C6H12O2. Possible structures could be an ester, like methyl cyclopentanoate or something with an ester group. If it's an ester, the structure R-O-CO-R', the cleavage could produce certain fragments. Alternatively, maybe the ester group breaks to form a carbonyl fragment.

Option B: C6H10O. This would be an alkene plus something else, maybe an alcohol. But the FTIR showed a broad peak around 3000, which could be the -OH. If it's an alcohol, then the structure would have an -OH group, but where's the carbonyl? Wait, the IR has a peak at 1700, which suggests a carbonyl. Oh, so this would require the compound to have both a carbonyl and an alcohol group. But wait, can a compound have both? Like a ketone and an alcohol. For example, cyclohexanone with an alcohol substituent. But let's think about the formula. C6H10O would have the formula similar to cyclohexene (which is C6H10) plus an O. Wait, but cyclohexene has 10 H, and if you have an -OH, that would add another O, making the formula C6H10O2, which is option C.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me calculate molecular weights. For each formula:

A: C6H12O2. MW = (6*12) + (12*1) + (2*16) =72 +12 +32=116.
B: C6H10O: 72 +10 +16=98.
C: C6H10O2: 72 +10 +32=114.
D: C6H12O:72+12+16=100.

So the molecular ion would be at 116 (A), 98 (B), 114 (C), 100 (D).

But the mass spec showed a fragment at 45. Let's think about possible fragments.

45 is a common mass. For example, a fragment like CH3COO- would be 60, but that's not it. Alternatively, the fragment could be a (CH2)2O group, which is 44 (if not). Wait, 45 is 45 amu. Let me think of the possible groups.

Option C is C6H10O2. If the compound is an ester, say methyl something. For example, methyl cyclopentanoate is C6H10O2. When the ester breaks, you'll get the methyl group (15) and the acyloxy part. Alternatively, the ester cleavage would form a carbonyl. Hmm, perhaps the fragment is the acyloxy group losing something. Alternatively, maybe it's a tropylium ion or another structure.

Wait, another approach: think about m/z 45 as the molecular ion of another compound. 45 corresponds to C3H7O, but that's not a likely structure. Alternatively, it could be a CH2CH2O group, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe it's a fragment from an ester. For example, if you have an ester R-O-CO-O-R', could it break in a way that the fragment is 45? Alternatively, maybe the ester group breaks to form a fragment like (CH2)2O, which would be 44, but 45 is a bit higher.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is a (CH3)2CO group. Wait, (CH3)2CO is acetone, which is 58. No, that's not 45.

Another possibility: the fragment is a CH2CH2O group (which is 44), but maybe adding a methyl group? Not sure.

Alternatively, think about the possible molecular formulas. Let's take each option and see what kind of fragments they might produce.

Option A: C6H12O2. Possible structures: ester or ketone. If it's an ester, say methyl cyclopentanoate (which is C6H10O2, not A), so wait, no. Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled. Let me think again.

Wait, option A is C6H12O2. The molecular formula has 6 carbons, 12 hydrogens, 2 oxygens. Degrees of unsaturation: 1. So one ring or one double bond.

If it's a cyclic ester, like a lactide, but that's more of a cyclic structure. Alternatively, it could be a diester, but that would require more oxygen. Wait, no. Alternatively, maybe a cyclic ketone with an ester group—unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a diethyl ester, but that would be more carbons. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is a six-membered ring with an ester group, like cyclohexyl acetate? No, that would have more carbons.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a substituted cyclopentane with an ester or ketone group. But I'm not getting anywhere with this.

Alternatively, let's think about the mass spec. A fragment at m/z=45. Let's think about what groups have a mass of 45. The molecular formula for 45 is C3H7O (3*12=36 +7=43 +16=59? Oh wait, 36+7 is 43, plus 16 is 59. No. Alternatively, maybe it's a CH3COOCH2 group. Wait, CH3COO is 60. No.

Wait, perhaps a fragment like C(O)CH2CH2O? Not sure.

Wait another approach: 45 is the molecular ion of a smaller molecule. For example, maybe the fragment is an ester group. Let me think of the possible structures. If the compound is an ester, say R-O-CO-R', the cleavage could produce R-O-CO- as a fragment. The mass of that would depend on R and R'. Alternatively, when the ester breaks, it could lose the R' group, leaving R-O-CO-O, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the compound is methyl cyclopentanoate. Its formula is C6H10O2. Let's see: cyclopentanoic acid's ester would have 6 carbons (5 from the ring, 1 from the methyl ester). So that's C6H10O2, which is option C.

In the mass spectrum, methyl cyclopentanoate could fragment. The ester group could break, leading to the formation of the acylium ion. The acylium ion would have a mass corresponding to the acyl group. For cyclopentanoate, the acyl group is cyclopentanoyl (C5H8O2?), but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, maybe the ester breaks into the methyl group and the rest. The methyl group is 15, which doesn't match 45.

Wait, perhaps the compound is a cyclic ester, like a lactone. For a six-membered ring, that would be a gamma-lactone. The formula would be C6H10O2, which is option C.

In that case, the lactone ring would have a carbonyl. The NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, which would be from a double bond elsewhere. Wait, but lactones are cyclic esters, and they have a carbonyl but not a double bond. Hmm, but the NMR shows vinyl protons, so there's a double bond in the structure.

Wait, maybe the compound has both a double bond and a carbonyl. Like an alpha, beta-unsaturated ester. For example, something like methyl vinyl something. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the compound could be a cyclic ketone with an ester group. But that might complicate the formula.

Wait, back to the FTIR. The strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. If there are two carbonyl groups, that could explain it. But the options don't have two oxygens except for A and C. Wait, options A and C have two oxygens.

Option A is C6H12O2. So if the compound has two carbonyl groups, like perhaps a diketone or an ester and a ketone, but that would require more oxygens. Wait, no: an ester has one oxygen, a ketone has one. So two oxygens would make sense.

So in option A, two oxygen atoms. So possibly two carbonyl groups. Let's say the compound is a diketone. Then, the FTIR would show two peaks for two carbonyls. But in that case, the NMR would show more specific signals. Alternatively, if it's an ester and an aromatic ring with conjugation, the 1650 cm^-1 could be from the ring.

Wait, but the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, which suggests a double bond. So perhaps the structure is an alpha, beta-unsaturated ketone or an ester.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try another angle. The FTIR has a broad peak at 3000, which is likely an -OH group. So the compound has an alcohol group. But wait, looking at the options, options A and C have two oxygens, which could be an ester and an alcohol, or two ester groups, or a ketone and an alcohol. Or maybe an acid, but then we would have a broad peak in IR around 2500-3000.

Wait, wait. If the compound is an acid, the broad peak would be very broad, perhaps from -COOH. But if it's an alcohol, the peak is broad but might not be as strong. Alternatively, maybe it's a conjugated system. Hmm.

But the problem says the broad peak is very broad, which is more typical of an -OH group, perhaps in an alcohol or a carboxylic acid.

If it's a carboxylic acid, then the formula would include two oxygens (COOH). So for example, a compound with a carboxylic acid group and another functional group. But in that case, the FTIR would also show a peak around 2500-3300 for the O-H stretch.

Wait, the problem says the FTIR shows a very broad peak at 3000. So maybe it's an alcohol, not a carboxylic acid. Because carboxylic acids have wider, broader peaks, but perhaps in this case, it's just a broad peak.

Alternatively, maybe the compound is an ester. Esters don't have OH groups, but if the FTIR shows a broad peak, maybe it's an alcohol.

Wait, but if the compound has an ester group and an alcohol, that would mean two oxygen-containing functional groups. So, the formula would need to have two oxygen atoms. Looking at the options, A and C have two oxygen atoms.

Option A: C6H12O2. So maybe the structure is an ester plus an alcohol.

Wait, but that would require more than six carbons in some cases, or perhaps it's a cyclic structure.

Alternatively, the structure could be something like an ortho ester, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is an ester with a double bond. For example, vinyl acetate is an ester with a double bond. But vinyl acetate is C4H6O2. Our options are C6H10O2 (option C), which would be a larger ester.

Wait, but vinyl acetate has the formula C4H6O2. If our compound is something like methyl cyclopentenoate, it would have more carbons.

But perhaps the mass spec fragment can help. If it's an ester, the fragment at 45 could be the acyloxy group. For example, in methyl propionate, the acyloxy group would be propanoyl, which is 58. No, that's not 45.

Wait, another thought: if the fragment is at 45, it's 45 amu. Let's calculate what possible groups could have a mass of 45. Let's see:

45 = sum of (12*C +1*H +16*O +14*N). Assuming no N, so 12C + H +16O =45.

Possible combinations:

- C3H3O: 3*12=36 +3=39 +16=55 → too high.
- C3H5O: 36 +5=41 +16=57 → nope.
- C3H7O: 36+7=43 +16=59 → nope.

Hmm, no. Alternatively, maybe it's a group with 2 carbons. Let's see.

C2H5O: 24 +5=29 +16=45. Oh! So C2H5O is 45. What would that be? An ethoxy group, OCH2CH3. Wait, no, the mass of ethoxy is 45? Let's compute: O is 16, C2H5 is 29 (12*2 +5). So 29+16=45. Yes! So a fragment of m/z=45 could be the ethoxy group, OCH2CH3.

So, if the compound has an ethoxy group, that would produce a fragment at 45.

Looking back at the options, which have ethoxy as part of their structure.

Option A: C6H12O2. If it's an ester, say ethyl something. So for example, ethyl something-oate. Let's see, ethyl propionate is C5H10O2. But our compound is C6, so perhaps ethyl cyclopentanoate would be C7H12O2, which doesn't match our options.

Wait, maybe it's not an ester but something else. Alternatively, maybe the ethoxy group is part of a different structure.

Wait, another possibility: the fragment is from the loss of something else. For example, in an ester, the R group could break off. If the R group is ethyl (45), then the ester would have R-O-CO-. So the fragment would be the R-O-CO- group. Wait, but the mass would be higher than 45. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule loses a part that leaves the ethoxy group as a fragment. For example, in an ester like ethyl acetate (C4H8O2), the ethyl group (45) could be a fragment if the ester breaks. But in that case, the molecular formula would be different.

Wait, but our options are C6H10O2 (option C) and C6H12O2 (option A). Let's see what ethoxy group would imply. If the compound is an ester with an ethoxy group, the formula would be R-O-CO-R', where R is ethyl. So R would contribute 2 carbons, and R' would contribute 4. So, the ester would be C6H10O2 if R' is a four-carbon group.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is an ethyl ester of a four-carbon acid. That would fit C6H10O2: the acid would be four carbons (RCOOH), ester would be RCOOCH2CH3. So, RCOOCH2CH3 would have formula C5H10O2. Wait, but our options are C6. So maybe R is a three-carbon group. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting stuck here.

Alternatively, maybe the ethoxy group is part of a different structure, like an ether. But the options with two oxygen atoms could be esters or ethers.

Wait, but the IR shows a peak at 1700, which is more indicative of an ester or ketone.

Hmm. Another approach: the presence of vinyl protons in the NMR suggests a double bond. So the compound has a double bond, which accounts for one degree of unsaturation. So the formula must have at least one degree from a double bond.

Looking at the options:

A: DOU=1 → double bond or ring.

B: DOU=2 → double bond and ring, or two double bonds.

C: DOU=2 → same as B.

D: DOU=1 → same as A.

If the NMR shows vinyl protons, then the compound has a double bond. So all options except those with only one degree (A and D) could have either a ring and a double bond or two double bonds.

But let's think about the options. Let's say the structure is an ester with a double bond. For example, an alpha, beta-unsaturated ester.

For example, methyl acrylate is CH2=CHCOOCH3. The formula is C4H6O2. But our options are C6H10O2 (option C), which is larger. So maybe the structure is a cyclic ester with a double bond.

Wait, a lactone with a double bond? Or perhaps a substituted cyclic ester.

Another thought: the FTIR has a peak at 1650 cm^-1. If that's an aromatic ring, but we don't have any indication of aromatic protons in the NMR. Wait, the NMR shows vinyl, not aromatic, so maybe it's a conjugated carbonyl group.

Wait, maybe the structure is a cyclic ester with a double bond. For example, a six-membered ring with an ester linkage and a double bond.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a diester with a double bond.

But I'm not making much progress here, so let's think of the options again.

Option C is C6H10O2. Degrees of unsaturation: 2. So two rings, or a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds.

If the structure has a double bond (from the vinyl protons) and an ester group (from the carbonyl), that would account for two degrees. So the formula is C6H10O2.

So the structure could be an ester with a double bond. For example, something like divinyl something, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: the FTIR shows two strong peaks at 1700 and 1650. If the compound has an ester (1700) and another carbonyl group (like a ketone or aldehyde) at 1650, that would make sense. But in that case, how would the formula fit?

Wait, if the compound has both an ester and a ketone group, that would require more oxygens. But the options only have two oxygens, so that's possible.

But the formula for such a compound would be CxHyO2, which matches options A and C.

But I'm not sure. Let me think back to the mass spec.

If the fragment is 45, which could be the ethoxy group (OCH2CH3), then the compound would have an ethoxy group. So in the formula, if it's an ester, the R-O part is ethyl, and the R'CO part is something else.

So, for example, if the compound is ethyl cyclopentenoate, the formula would be C7H10O2, which doesn't match any options. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe it's an ester with an ethyl group and a four-carbon acid. That would make the formula C5H10O2, which again doesn't match.

Wait, another possibility: the fragment comes from a different part of the molecule. For instance, maybe the compound has a benzene ring with substituents. But the NMR doesn't indicate aromatic protons, just vinyl, so probably not.

Alternatively, the fragment could be from the loss of a larger group, leaving a smaller fragment of 45. For example, the molecule could lose a group with a higher mass, leaving the 45 fragment.

But without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to say.

Let me try another approach. Let's look at each option and see which fits the data.

Option A: C6H12O2.

DOU=1. So either a ring or a double bond.

FTIR: Broad peak at 3000 (maybe OH), and two carbonyls at 1700 and 1650. Hmm, two carbonyls would require two oxygen atoms, which this option has. But with only one degree, it can't have two carbonyls (each carbonyl is a double bond). Wait, no, each carbonyl is a double bond. So two carbonyls would account for two degrees of unsaturation, but option A has only one. So that's a problem. So option A can't have two carbonyl groups because that would require two degrees, but it only has one.

So option A is unlikely because it can't have two carbonyl groups. Then, maybe the 1650 peak isn't a carbonyl. If the 1650 is from an aromatic ring, but the NMR didn't show aromatic protons. So perhaps the 1650 is from a conjugated double bond, like an alkene adjacent to a carbonyl.

So, in that case, the 1700 is the carbonyl, and the 1650 is a conjugated double bond (C=C). That would make sense. So for option A, which has one degree of unsaturation, perhaps it's a cyclohexene ring with an ester group. But wait, a cyclohexene would have a ring (one degree) and the ester would have a carbonyl (another degree), total two degrees, but option A only allows one. So that's a problem.

So option A is unlikely because it can't support two double bonds (a ring plus a carbonyl).

Option B: C6H10O.

DOU=2. So two degrees: maybe a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds.

FTIR: Broad peak at 3000 (could be -OH), but with only one O in the formula, maybe it's an alcohol. Then the other peak at 1700 would be a carbonyl, which would require an O, but the formula only has one O. So that's a problem. Because 1700 is a carbonyl (C=O), which requires O. If the formula has only one O, and it's used in the carbonyl group, then the broad peak at 3000 can't be an -OH. So this option is unlikely.

So, option B is probably not correct.

Option C: C6H10O2.

DOU=2. So two degrees: maybe a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds.

FTIR: 3000 (broad, perhaps -OH), 1700 (carbonyl), 1650 (maybe conjugated double bond or another carbonyl).

In this case, the compound could have both an -OH group and a carbonyl group. But wait, the formula has two O's. So if one O is in the carbonyl (like an ester or ketone), the other could be in an -OH group.

But wait, if the compound has both an -OH and a carbonyl group, that would require two O's. So that fits.

The NMR has vinyl hydrogens, so a double bond is present, which contributes one degree. The other degree could be a ring.

So, perhaps the structure is a cyclic ester (lactone) with a double bond.

But wait, a lactone is a cyclic ester and has a carbonyl. If it also has a double bond, that would account for two degrees (ring and double bond). So, for example, a cyclopentenyl ester.

Alternatively, it could be a substituted cyclohexene with an ester group.

But then the mass spec fragment at 45 could be the ethoxy group, which fits.

Alternatively, the compound could be an ester with an ethoxy group and a double bond elsewhere.

So, considering all these factors, option C seems plausible.

Option D: C6H12O.

DOU=1. So a ring or a double bond.

FTIR: Broad peak at 3000 (could be -OH). Then, a carbonyl at 1700 would require an O, but this option only has one O. So, the 1700 peak can't be a carbonyl unless the O is used there, leaving no O for an -OH group. But the FTIR shows a broad peak, suggesting an -OH. So this is a problem. So option D is unlikely.

So, based on this analysis, the correct formula is option C: C6H10O2.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To identify the unknown compound, the spectroscopic data provided was analyzed as follows:

### FTIR Analysis:
- **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹**: Indicates the presence of an -OH group, likely from an alcohol or carboxylic acid.
- **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹**: Suggests a carbonyl group (C=O), possibly from an ester, ketone, or aldehyde.
- **Strong absorption at 1650 cm⁻¹**: Could indicate a conjugated carbonyl group or a double bond (C=C).

### ¹H NMR Analysis:
- The presence of **vinyl hydrogens** suggests the compound contains a double bond (C=C).

### Mass Spectrometry:
- A fragment peak at **m/z = 45** was observed. This is consistent with an ethoxy group (C₂H₅O), as its mass is 45.

### Degrees of Unsaturation:
The degrees of unsaturation (DOU) were calculated for each option:
- **A) C₆H₁₂O₂**: DOU = 1 (one ring or one double bond).
- **B) C₆H₁₀O**: DOU = 2 (two rings, a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds).
- **C) C₆H₁₀O₂**: DOU = 2 (two rings, a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds).
- **D) C₆H₁₂O**: DOU = 1 (one ring or one double bond).

### Analysis of Each Option:
1. **Option A (C₆H₁₂O₂)**:
   - DOU = 1, so it can only accommodate one double bond or one ring.
   - The FTIR data suggests two carbonyl groups (1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹), which would require two degrees of unsaturation. This is inconsistent with the DOU of 1.
   - **Conclusion**: Unlikely.

2. **Option B (C₆H₁₀O)**:
   - DOU = 2, so it can accommodate two double bonds or a ring and a double bond.
   - The FTIR data shows a broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ (likely -OH) and a strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ (C=O). However, this option only has one oxygen atom, which would not allow for both an -OH and a carbonyl group.
   - **Conclusion**: Unlikely.

3. **Option C (C₆H₁₀O₂)**:
   - DOU = 2, so it can accommodate two double bonds or a ring and a double bond.
   - The FTIR data fits well: the broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ could correspond to an -OH group, and the strong peaks at 1700 cm⁻¹ and 1650 cm⁻¹ could correspond to a carbonyl group and a conjugated double bond, respectively.
   - The mass spectrometry fragment at m/z = 45 is consistent with an ethoxy group, which aligns with the formula.
   - The NMR data showing vinyl hydrogens supports the presence of a double bond.
   - **Conclusion**: Most consistent with the data.

4. **Option D (C₆H₁₂O)**:
   - DOU = 1, so it can only accommodate one double bond or one ring.
   - Similar to Option A, the FTIR data suggests two carbonyl groups, which would require two degrees of unsaturation. This is inconsistent with the DOU of 1.
