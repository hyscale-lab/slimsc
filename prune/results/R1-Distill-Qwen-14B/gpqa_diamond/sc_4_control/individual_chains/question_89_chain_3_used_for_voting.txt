Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let me read through it carefully.

The question involves several reactions and the analysis of the NMR spectrum after each step. The starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I think adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so 1,3-dibromo would have bromine atoms on adjacent carbons in the structure. 

First, it's heated with excess KOH at 240°C. I remember that when vicinal dihalides (two halogens on adjacent carbons) react with a strong base like KOH, they undergo an elimination reaction, typically dehydrohalogenation, forming an alkene. So, the product here should be an adamantane derivative with a double bond where the bromines were. The product is a light yellow solid. The IR spectrum shows a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹. Hmm, but wait, double bonds usually show around 1650 cm⁻¹. Alternatively, maybe the IR is for a carbonyl group? Wait, 1720 is more like a carbonyl stretch, but if the product is an alkene, that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe it's an epoxide? No, because an epoxide would have a peak around 1200-1300 cm⁻¹ for the C-O stretch, and maybe the IR here is showing something else. Alternatively, maybe the reaction isn't elimination but something else. Oh wait, KOH and dibromide – perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation to form an alkene. But then why the IR peak at 1720? That's confusing. Wait, another thought: maybe the product isn't an alkene but a diol? Because KOH can also perform an SN2 reaction if the structure allows. But adamantane is a very rigid structure, so if there are two good leaving groups (Br) on adjacent carbons, maybe they undergo an elimination to form a double bond. So, the product would be 1,3-diene? Or perhaps it's an epoxide? No, because epoxides form from diols with a peracid, not KOH. Wait, maybe it's an elimination to form a cyclohexene-like ring. Oh, wait, adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so perhaps the elimination forms a bridge with a double bond.

But the IR peak is at 1720 cm⁻¹. That's a strong, sharp peak. That usually corresponds to a carbonyl group, like a ketone or ester. Or maybe an aldehyde? But if it's an alkene, why the carbonyl? Hmm, maybe I made a mistake. Perhaps the reaction isn't elimination but a substitution. If the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, and KOH is used, maybe each Br is replaced by an OH group. But that would form 1,3-diol. But then the IR would show O-H stretches around 3300 cm⁻¹, which it doesn't mention here. Also, the NMR data shows a peak at 4.79 ppm, which is typical for an -OH group. Wait, 4.79 is around where alcohols appear as broad peaks, but here it's a triplet and not broad. Maybe it's an ether? No, because KOH wouldn't do that. Alternatively, maybe it's an epoxide. Wait, but how would you get an epoxide from a dihalide? I don't think that's the case. Alternatively, perhaps it's a di-substituted alkene, but then why the IR peak? Hmm. Maybe the product is an alkyne. The IR for a carbonyl is 1720, but for an alkyne it's around 2100-2260 cm⁻¹. So that doesn’t fit either.

Wait, maybe the initial reaction is a double elimination, forming a ketone or something like that. But I'm a bit stuck. Let me think about the NMR data. The 1H NMR of product 1: 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). So the 4.79 is likely an -OH group, but as a triplet, which is a bit unusual. Alternatively, maybe it's an ethereal oxygen, but that's usually around 3-4 ppm. Wait, maybe it's a di-substituted alkene adjacent to an oxygen? Alternatively, maybe it's an epoxide. Wait, no, I'm not convinced. Alternatively, perhaps it's a cyclic ether, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: What if the product is adamantane with a ketone group? So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane reacting with KOH in a way that eliminates HBr twice, forming a carbonyl group. For example, if two adjacent Brs are removed, each time with a base, leading to the formation of a carbonyl. So, perhaps it's an diketone? But that would require two eliminations, and the structure might not support that. Alternatively, maybe it's a single elimination, but I'm not seeing it. Another possibility: The KOH could cause an intramolecular elimination, forming a ring with a double bond. So, maybe the product is an annulene or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the product isn't an alkene but a diol, but the IR doesn't show broad O-H stretches. Hmm. Wait, maybe it's a hemiacetal or something else, but that seems less likely.

Let me think about product 1's structure. The NMR has a triplet at 4.79 ppm (2H). That's probably a CH2 group connected to an electronegative atom. Like an -OCH2- group. Then, the 2.41-2.23 (10H) – that's a lot of protons. Adamantane has a lot of CH groups, perhaps these are the bridgehead hydrogens. The 1.94 (2H) could be another CH2 group. So maybe the product is an ether with an OCH2CH2 group or something similar. Or perhaps a diol.

Alternatively, maybe it's a vicinal diol, but then the NMR would show broad peaks for OH groups. The data here shows 4.79 as a triplet, which is sharp, so perhaps it's an ether. Wait, maybe it's an epoxide. In an epoxide, the two CH2 groups adjacent to the oxygen would show up as a triplet due to coupling with each other. Wait, but epoxide protons are typically around 3.5-4.5 ppm as a triplet. But in this case, 4.79 is a triplet for 2H. So maybe that's the case. But why the IR? Epoxides don't have a carbonyl, so the IR wouldn't show 1720. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, another possibility: The product is a ketone. The IR at 1720 would match a ketone. So, perhaps product 1 is a diketone? Let's see. 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH could eliminate two HBr molecules, forming a double bond adjacent to a ketone. Wait, but two eliminations would form a conjugated diene? I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps each Br is replaced by an O- group, but then it would form a diol, which doesn't fit the IR.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction forms a carbonyl group. For example, if each Br is replaced by an O- group, but that would require two substitutions, but KOH is a strong base and would deprotonate, perhaps leading to elimination. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I should think differently. Let me think about the reaction: 1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH → product 1. KOH is a strong base and a good nucleophile. Since the starting material is di-bromo, perhaps it's undergoing a double elimination (dehydrohalogenation) to form an alkene. So, product 1 is 1,3-diene adamantane? But then why the IR at 1720? Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclopropane or something else.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a double elimination, forming a bridge. Let me imagine the structure of adamantane. It's a diamondoid, with four cyclohexane rings fused together. So, 1,3-dibromo would be on adjacent carbons. Eliminating two HBr would form a double bond in the bridge. So, product 1 would be an adamantane with a double bond in one of the bridges. Then, the IR would show a peak around 1650 cm⁻¹ for the C=C. But the given IR is at 1720, which is higher. Hmm, maybe it's not an alkene then. 

Wait, another thought: Maybe the product is an epoxide. But wait, how would that form from a dihalide? Epoxides are formed from diols via oxidation, typically with a peracid. So that's not the case here. Or maybe it's an elimination to form an epoxide, but I don't think that's possible with KOH. So perhaps I'm back to thinking about a carbonyl.

Wait, maybe the product is a ketone, which would have the 1720 cm⁻¹ peak in IR. So, how could 1,3-dibromoadamantane form a ketone? Perhaps via a double elimination, losing two HBr and forming a carbonyl group. Wait, but in that case, each elimination would form a double bond. So, how can two eliminations lead to a carbonyl? Maybe through a conjugate elimination. Let me think: If two adjacent bromines are present, maybe each elimination forms a double bond, but perhaps in a way that a carbonyl is formed elsewhere. Alternatively, perhaps it's an example of a double dehydrohalogenation forming a conjugated diene, but that doesn't lead to a carbonyl. Alternatively, maybe the structure rearranges.

Another approach: think about the NMR. The peak at 4.79 (2H) as a triplet suggests that these two hydrogens are adjacent to another two hydrogen in a coupling pattern. Like a CH2 group next to another CH2. Maybe it's an ether like OCH2CH2.

Then, the 2.41-2.23 (10H) – this is a multiplet. Adamantane has a lot of CH groups, so this might be the bridgehead or adjacent CH groups. The 1.94 (2H) could be another CH2 group.

Wait, perhaps the product is 1,3-adamantanediol. But that would have OH groups, which would appear as broad peaks in the NMR, but here it's a triplet. So that's not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps it's an epoxide. The NMR of an epoxide typically shows a triplet for each CH2 group because each H is coupled with the two H on the adjacent CH2. So the triplet at 4.79 ppm (2H) could be the epoxide's CH2 groups. Then, the IR would show the epoxide's C-O-C stretch around 1200-1300 cm⁻¹, not 1720. So this doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps the product is an ether, like an ethoxy group attached to adamantane. But why would KOH produce that? Maybe via a Williamson ether synthesis, but that requires an alkoxide and an alkyl halide. But with two bromines, maybe it's a different scenario.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a diepoxide, but I'm not seeing how that forms.

Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the initial reaction is a substitution, not elimination. So, KOH (a strong base) could deprotonate a position adjacent to Br, leading to an SN2 substitution. But with two Brs, perhaps it's a double substitution. So, replacing Br with OH groups. But then, the product would be a diol. But earlier I thought that the NMR doesn't show broad OH peaks. Alternatively, perhaps the OH groups are exchanging with the solvent (like D2O), so they don't appear in the NMR. Wait, but the question says to exclude those that exchange with deuterated solvent. So, the 4.79 ppm peak isn't OH.

Wait, perhaps the product is an ether with two oxygen atoms. But I'm not making progress here.

Let me think about the IR. 1720 cm⁻¹ is a strong indication of a carbonyl group. So product 1 must have a carbonyl. So, perhaps the reaction is a double elimination, forming a carbonyl. But how?

Wait, maybe it's a case of dehydrohalogenation followed by another elimination to form a ketone. For instance, perhaps each elimination forms an alkene, but in a way that a carbonyl is formed elsewhere. Alternatively, perhaps a gem-dibromide eliminates to form a carbonyl, but in this case, it's 1,3-dibromide.

Wait, another scenario. Suppose each Br is on adjacent carbons with each having two Hs. Then, elimination could form a double bond, and another elimination elsewhere could form a carbonyl. But I'm not sure about the structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a diketone. If two adjacent Br atoms are removed, each elimination could form a carbonyl. But that would require each Br to be on a CH2 group, perhaps. Alternatively, maybe a single elimination forms a double bond, and another reaction forms a carbonyl. Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the product is a quinone structure, but that seems too complex.

Wait, maybe the product is an epoxide, but I can't reconcile the IR. Alternatively, perhaps the product isn't an alkene but something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction isn't elimination but a substitution. Wait, but with two Brs, substitution would require two equivalents of OH-.

Wait, perhaps the product is a gem-diol, but that's unlikely because it's not common, and the IR doesn't fit.

Wait, another thought: Maybe it's an elimination reaction that forms a carbonyl. For example, if two adjacent Brs are eliminated as HBr, and the two carbons form a carbonyl group. So, each Br is on a CH2 group, and eliminating HBr from each would form a C=O. So, perhaps product 1 is a ketone. Let me imagine the structure: 1,3-dibromoadamantane would lose two HBr molecules, forming a carbonyl group. But wait, that would require two adjacent Brs on each side of a carbon, which then lose HBr, turning into a carbonyl. So the structure would be a ketone.

If that's the case, the IR would show a peak at ~1720 cm⁻¹, which fits. The NMR would then have a peak for the carbonyl group, but wait, the NMR doesn't have a peak around 2 ppm for a carbonyl (as carbonyls don't have protons). Let me check the NMR data again. Oh, the 4.79 ppm (2H) must be something else. Maybe the carbonyl isn't directly involved, but perhaps there's an adjacent group.

Wait, maybe the product is a diketone. So, the structure has two ketone groups. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the product is an enol. But enols would have hydroxyl groups, which don't fit the NMR.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is an epoxide with a ketone group. But I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the product is a diene with an adjacent carbonyl group. But then the IR would show both the C=C and C=O peaks.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a methyl ketone. But how would that form?

Hmm, I'm stuck on the first step. Let me think about the next steps to see if that helps.

Product 1 is then heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. Aluminum isopropoxide is a Lewis acid catalyst, often used in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. But the starting material here is product 1, which is probably an aromatic compound, but adamantane isn't aromatic. Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an enol ether or something else that can undergo acylation.

Wait, product 1's NMR has a triplet at 4.79 ppm (2H), which could be an OCH2CH2O group, making it an ether. If product 1 is an ether, then treatment with Al isopropoxide could lead to something else. Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a ketone, and Al isopropoxide could act as a catalyst for some kind of condensation.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is an enol ether, which upon treatment with a Lewis acid could undergo some kind of cyclization or alkylation.

But I'm not making progress. Let me think about the next step: product 2 is treated with ozone at -78°C, then dimethyl sulfide is added to form product 3. Ozonolysis is typically used to cleave double bonds. So, product 2 must have a double bond.

Wait, so product 3 is formed by ozonolysis of product 2. So product 2 has a double bond. Ozonolysis would break the double bond into two carbonyl groups.

But if product 2 has a double bond, then product 1 must have a structure that can form a double bond upon reaction with Al isopropoxide. Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a ketone, and Al isopropoxide helps form an enol, which could then dimerize or something else, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe product 1 is a ketone, and product 2 is an enol ether formed by some kind of cyclization. Then, ozonolysis of product 2 would cleave the double bond, forming carbonyl groups.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an alkene, but then why the IR at 1720? Hmm.

Wait, but perhaps the first step forms an alkene, and the IR peak is a mistake. Or maybe the IR is due to the solvent or another impurity. Alternatively, perhaps the IR is for a carbonyl group formed elsewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps the product 1 is a di-substituted alkene with a carbonyl group elsewhere. But I'm not seeing it.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial product is an epoxide, but that doesn't fit the IR.

Wait, maybe product 1 is cyclopentanone or something similar. But adamantane is a larger structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial reaction forms a ketone, and product 2 is a dienone, which upon ozonolysis would form two carbonyl groups. But I'm not sure.

Hmm, perhaps I should move to the third step, because the question is about product 3's NMR.

Product 3 is formed by ozonolysis of product 2, which has a double bond. Ozonolysis typically cleaves double bonds into carbonyl groups. So, if product 2 has a double bond, product 3 would have carbonyl groups where the double bond was.

In the NMR of product 3, what is the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen (not exchanging with solvent)?

Wait, after ozonolysis, the double bond is split into two carbonyl groups. So, the structure would have carbonyl groups where the double bond was. So, any hydrogens adjacent to the carbonyl would be deshielded and appear downfield.

But wait, ozonolysis of a symmetric double bond would produce two identical carbonyl compounds. If the double bond is between two identical groups, the product would be the same on both sides.

But the question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen. Let me think: if the double bond in product 2 was between two CH2 groups, then ozonolysis would break it into two aldehyde groups. For example, if product 2 was CH2=CH2, ozonolysis would give two formaldehyde molecules. But that's a simple case. Alternatively, if the double bond is in a more complex structure, the ozonolysis products would have carbonyl groups connected to other structures.

Alternatively, perhaps the double bond in product 2 is part of a larger ring or structure. For example, imagine product 2 is an annulene, and ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl groups, perhaps forming ketones or aldehydes.

Wait, but in the NMR of product 3, considering the coupling pattern, perhaps the most deshielded hydrogen is adjacent to a carbonyl group. So, if product 3 has a structure like R-CO-R', the protons adjacent to the carbonyl would be deshielded and appear downfield. Those protons could be split based on their neighboring protons.

If the most deshielded hydrogen is adjacent to a carbonyl group and has two neighboring hydrogens, then it might be a triplet. But I'm not certain.

Wait, another scenario: if product 2 is an alkene that, upon ozonolysis, forms two carbonyl groups, each with adjacent CH2 groups. For example, the double bond in product 2 is between two CH2 groups, so ozonolysis would yield two aldehyde groups. Then, the aldehyde protons would be deshielded and appear around 9-10 ppm as a singlet (since aldehydes have no neighboring hydrogens). But the question says the most deshielded hydrogen is not exchanging, so perhaps it's not an aldehyde.

Alternatively, if the double bond in product 2 is between two CH groups, then ozonolysis would form two ketones. But then, the adjacent hydrogens would be on the CH groups, which would couple with each other. For example, if the structure is CH2-CH2, then ozonolysis would give two aldehydes, but that's a simple case.

Wait, perhaps the double bond in product 2 is part of a more complex structure, like a cyclopropane. But ozonolysis of cyclopropane would produce different products.

Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is a di-substituted alkene, such as CH2=CH-R. Ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl groups: one from each side of the double bond. For example, if product 2 is CH2=CH-CH2-R, ozonolysis would give a formaldehyde and a ketone or aldehyde, depending on R.

Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is an enol ether, which upon ozonolysis would cleave the double bond.

But I'm not making progress. Let me think about the coupling pattern. The options are triplet, triplet of triplets, doublet of triplets, or pentet.

If the most deshielded hydrogen is part of a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl, and is next to another CH2 group, then it would have two neighboring hydrogens, leading to a triplet.

Alternatively, if it's part of a CH group adjacent to a carbonyl, and coupled with two other sets of protons, perhaps a triplet of triplets.

Wait, perhaps the structure after ozonolysis has a group like (CH2)2CO. Then, the CH2 groups adjacent to the carbonyl would each have two neighboring Hs, leading to a triplet.

Alternatively, if the hydrogen is part of a CH group that's adjacent to another CH group, which is adjacent to a CH2, the coupling could be more complex.

Wait, another approach. The initial product 1, upon reaction with Al isopropoxide, becomes product 2. Al isopropoxide is used in Friedel-Crafts, but since product 1 is probably not aromatic, perhaps it's used for acylation or alkylation in a different context. Alternatively, it could catalyze the formation of an enol from a ketone.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a ketone, and product 2 is an enol ether. Then, ozonolysis would cleave the double bond in the enol ether, producing carbonyl groups.

If product 2 is an enol ether, its structure would be R-O-CH2-CH2-O-R, but that's a simple case. Alternatively, it's a conjugated enol ether, which would have a double bond adjacent to the oxygen.

Wait, another thought: Product 1 is a ketone, product 2 is an enol ether (formed via acid catalysis), and product 3 is the ozonolysis product, which would cleave the double bond in the enol ether.

So, the enol ether would have a structure like R-O-CH2-CH2-O-R, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the enol ether is part of a ring.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3. It's the one most downfield, so probably adjacent to a carbonyl group. Let's say it's a CH2 group next to a carbonyl. Then, each CH2 proton would be adjacent to two others. So, each H would have two neighboring Hs, leading to a triplet.

Alternatively, if it's a CH group next to a carbonyl and adjacent to another CH group, each H would couple with two Hs (from the adjacent CH group), leading to a doublet of doublets or something else.

Wait, another scenario: If the ozonolysis product is a diketone, then the H adjacent to the carbonyl would be a triplet if they're each next to two Hs.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure after ozonolysis is something like O=C-(CH2)n-C=O. The CH2 groups adjacent to the carbonyls would each have two neighboring Hs, leading to triplets.

Wait, but in the NMR, the most deshielded H would be the one closest to the carbonyl. If it's a CH2 next to the carbonyl, then each H would see the two Hs on the same CH2 and the two Hs on the adjacent CH2. Wait, no, because the J coupling is only between adjacent Hs. So, for a CH2-CH2 group next to carbonyl, each H on the first CH2 would be split by the two Hs on the same CH2 (giving a triplet) and perhaps by the next CH2, but that's further away. Wait, coupling between adjacent CH2 groups would be through space or through bonds? Coupling between protons on adjacent carbons (vicinal coupling) occurs, typically as a smaller coupling constant (J around 2-4 Hz), but in some cases, like allylic or conjugated systems, it can be more significant.

Wait, but in product 3, the most deshielded H is probably on a CH2 next to a carbonyl. Each H on that CH2 would couple with the two Hs on the same CH2 (giving a triplet) and perhaps with the next CH2 group. But if the next group is another CH2, then each H would have coupling to two Hs on the same CH2 and two Hs on the adjacent CH2. But that would create a more complex splitting pattern.

Alternatively, perhaps the H is on a CH group next to a carbonyl and adjacent to another CH group. For example, O=C-CH2-CH2-C=O. Each H on the first CH2 would couple with the two Hs on the same CH2 (triplet) and with the two Hs on the adjacent CH2 (another triplet), leading to a triplet of triplets.

Wait, that makes sense. So, each H on the first CH2 would be a triplet due to coupling with the two Hs on the same CH2, and each H would also couple with the two Hs on the adjacent CH2, leading to another triplet. So the overall splitting would be a triplet of triplets.

But looking at the options, option B is triplet of triplets, and option C is doublet of triplets.

Wait, in that scenario, the H would have coupling with two Hs on the same CH2 (J1) and two Hs on the adjacent CH2 (J2). So, the splitting would be a triplet for each coupling, leading to a triplet of triplets.

So, the coupling pattern would be a triplet of triplets, which is option B.

Alternatively, perhaps the H is only coupled to the adjacent CH2 group, leading to a triplet.

Wait, but if the H is on a CH2 group next to a carbonyl, and the next group is another CH2, then each H on the first CH2 would have coupling to the two Hs on the same CH2 and the two Hs on the next CH2. So, each H would experience two triplets, leading to a triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, if the coupling constants are similar, it might appear as a pentet, but that's not one of the options.

Wait, perhaps the structure is such that each H is only coupled to two adjacent Hs. For example, if the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-O, then each H on the CH2 would be next to another CH2. So, each H on the first CH2 would be split by the two Hs on the same CH2 (triplet) and the two Hs on the adjacent CH2 (another triplet), leading to a triplet of triplets.

So, the most deshielded H (on the CH2 next to carbonyl) would show a triplet of triplets.

Looking at the options, option B is triplet of triplets.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves a multi-step reaction sequence starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Here's the analysis:

1. **Step 1: Reaction with KOH**  
   The starting material, 1,3-dibromoadamantane, is treated with excess KOH at 240°C. This likely results in a double elimination reaction, where two molecules of HBr are removed. The IR spectrum of the product (product 1) shows a strong absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is characteristic of a carbonyl group (C=O). The NMR data for product 1 includes a triplet at 4.79 ppm (2H), a multiplet at 2.41-2.23 ppm (10H), and a peak at 1.94 ppm (2H). This suggests that product 1 is a ketone, likely 1,3-diketone adamantane, where the two carbonyl groups are formed at the positions where the bromines were eliminated.

2. **Step 2: Reaction with Al isopropoxide**  
   Product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide. Aluminum isopropoxide, a Lewis acid, likely facilitates the formation of an enol ether from the diketone. This results in product 2, which contains a conjugated enol ether structure with a double bond adjacent to the oxygen atom.

3. **Step 3: Ozonolysis**  
   Product 2 is subjected to ozonolysis at -78°C, followed by the addition of dimethyl sulfide. Ozonolysis cleaves the double bond in the enol ether, producing two carbonyl groups. The resulting product (product 3) is a compound with carbonyl groups at the positions where the double bond was cleaved.

4. **Analysis of Product 3's NMR**  
   The question asks for the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom in product 3, excluding those that exchange with the deuterated solvent. The most deshielded hydrogen is likely adjacent to a carbonyl group. In product 3, this hydrogen is part of a CH₂ group next to a carbonyl group. Each hydrogen in this CH₂ group couples with the two hydrogens on the same CH₂ group (resulting in a triplet) and also couples with the two hydrogens on an adjacent CH₂ group (resulting in another triplet). This combination of couplings produces a **triplet of triplets** as the coupling pattern.

5. **Evaluation of Options**  
   - **A) Triplet**: This would occur if the hydrogen coupled with only two equivalent hydrogens, but the presence of additional coupling makes this incorrect.  
   - **B) Triplet of triplets**: This matches the scenario where the hydrogen couples with two hydrogens on the same CH₂ group and two hydrogens on an adjacent CH₂ group.  
   - **C) Doublet of triplets**: This would occur if the hydrogen coupled with one set of two hydrogens and another set of one hydrogen, which is not the case here.  
   - **D) Pentet**: This would occur if the hydrogen coupled with four equivalent hydrogens, which is not supported by the structure.

Thus, the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is a **triplet of triplets**.

Answer: B
