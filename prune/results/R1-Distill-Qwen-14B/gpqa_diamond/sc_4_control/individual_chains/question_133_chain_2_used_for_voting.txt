Okay, so I have this chemistry problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it's about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution containing potassium hydrogen phosphate and sodium hydrogen phosphate. Oh right, phosphate chemistry can be a bit tricky with all those dissociations.

Alright, the problem states that the solution has a volume of 200.00 cm³, which is 0.2 liters. There are 1.00 grams each of KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. The molecular weights are given: 136.09 g/mol for KH2PO4 and 177.99 g/mol for the sodium salt. The temperature is 25°C, which is standard conditions, so I don't think activity coefficients will come into play here.

I remember that phosphate exists in different forms depending on the pH. The species can be H3PO4, H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, or PO4^3-. The problem is asking specifically for the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which I think is HPO4^2-.

Wait, no. Wait, orthophosphate is H3PO4, but in solution, it dissociates. Oh wait, maybe I'm mixing terms. I think the different phosphate species are called ortho, pyro, meta, but in this context, the main species we deal with are the various hydrogen phosphates. Oh right, orthophosphate usually refers to H3PO4, but in solution, it's one of the deprotonated forms, depending on the pH.

But in this case, the solution contains KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. So we have H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- in solution. Wait, but the question is about orthophosphate ions. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Orthophosphoric acid is H3PO4. Its dissociation steps are:

H3PO4 ↔ H+ + H2PO4^- (Ka1)
H2PO4^- ↔ H+ + HPO4^2- (Ka2)
HPO4^2- ↔ H+ + PO4^3- (Ka3)

So, the species present in solution from KH2PO4 would be K+ and H2PO4^-.

From Na2HPO4·2H2O, which I think is sodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate. Its formula is Na2HPO4·2H2O. So when it dissolves, it gives 2 Na+ and HPO4^2-.

So the solution has both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- ions. Now, the question is about the concentration of orthophosphate ions. Wait, orthophosphate is H3PO4? Or is it another term? I might be mixing terms here. Alternatively, maybe the term is referring to HPO4^2- as orthophosphate. No, I think orthophosphate is the fully protonated form, H3PO4. But in solution, especially in a buffer, it's more likely to be in a deprotonated form.

Wait, maybe the question is referring to HPO4^2- as the orthophosphate ion. Alternatively, perhaps the orthophosphate ion is HPO4^3-? No, that's phosphite. Wait, no, PO4^3- is phosphate, HPO4^2- is hydrogen phosphate, H2PO4^- is dihydrogen phosphate.

I think I need to clarify: in this context, the 'orthophosphate' ion refers to HPO4^2-. Because ortho is the second dissociation step, right? Or maybe I'm getting confused. Wait, let me think. The first dissociation is H3PO4 losing a proton to become H2PO4^- (dihydrogen phosphate), the second is H+ from H2PO4^- to become HPO4^2- (hydrogen phosphate), and the third is H+ from HPO4^2- to become PO4^3- (phosphate). So the 'ortho' in this context probably refers to HPO4^2-.

But that depends on the question's wording. The question says, 'orthophosphate ions.' Hmm, maybe that's HPO4^2- as the ortho (ortho meaning adjacent in some contexts, but not sure if that's relevant here). Alternatively, maybe orthophosphate is H3PO4, but in solution, it's in other forms. So perhaps in this case, the concentration of HPO4^2- is what we need to calculate.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me read the question again. It says, what is the concentration of orthophosphate ions. Hmm. Well, the options are given in the order of 1e-6 to 3e-7 M. So probably, it's a matter of calculating the concentration of HPO4^2-.

But wait, the solution has both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-. So the ortho (if referring to HPO4^2-) would be present, but perhaps the solution is a buffer between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Wait, but the problem gives us the masses of the two salts. So let me think, first, compute the moles of each.

Moles of KH2PO4: mass is 1.00 g, Mw 136.09 g/mol. So moles = 1.00 / 136.09 ≈ 0.00734 moles.

Moles of Na2HPO4·2H2O: 1.00 g, Mw 177.99 g/mol. So moles = 1.00 / 177.99 ≈ 0.005615 moles.

Each mole of KH2PO4 gives one mole of H2PO4^-.

Each mole of Na2HPO4·2H2O gives one mole of HPO4^2-.

So the solution has 0.00734 moles of H2PO4^- and 0.005615 moles of HPO4^2- in 0.2 liters.

Wait, but wait. The solution volume is 200 cm³, which is 0.2 liters. So the concentrations would be:

[H2PO4^-] = 0.00734 / 0.2 = 0.0367 M

[HPO4^2-] = 0.005615 / 0.2 = 0.028075 M

But that's just the initial concentrations from the salts. But phosphate species can interconvert depending on pH. So the solution is a buffer solution because we have a weak acid (H2PO4^-) and its conjugate base (HPO4^2-). So the pH will be determined by the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.

Wait, but the problem isn't asking for pH; it's asking for the concentration of orthophosphate ions. So perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, but the initial concentrations are from the salts, but in solution, the phosphate species might interconvert. So the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- would adjust based on the pH.

Wait, but the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation relates the pH to the ratio of the concentrations of the conjugate base and acid. So if I can find the pH, I can find the ratio, and thus the concentrations.

Wait, but I don't know the pH. Alternatively, perhaps the solution is at pH where the H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- are in equilibrium, so their concentrations relate via Ka2.

Because the first dissociation is H3PO4 ↔ H+ + H2PO4^- (Ka1=7.5e-3)
The second is H2PO4^- ↔ H+ + HPO4^2- (Ka2=6.2e-8)
The third is HPO4^2- ↔ H+ + PO4^3- (Ka3=1.8e-12)

So the solution has H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- present. This suggests that the pH is between the second and third dissociation steps. Wait, no, because H2PO4^- is the acid, HPO4^2- is the conjugate base. So the pH is around the pKa2 of H3PO4.

So, the pH is determined by the ratio of [HPO4^2-] to [H2PO4^-].

Wait, but the problem is that the initial concentrations are from the salts, but in reality, the solution would be a buffer, and the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- would adjust to maintain the ratio according to the Ka2.

So, using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-])

But wait, if the solution is made by mixing these two salts, they'll form a buffer. The initial concentrations would be 0.0367 M H2PO4^- and 0.028075 M HPO4^2-.

But in reality, the solution's pH will cause some H2PO4^- to dissociate into H+ and HPO4^2-, and some HPO4^2- to accept H+ and become H2PO4^-.

Wait, but the system would be at equilibrium. So the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation applies.

So let me compute the ratio of [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] in the initial solution before any dissociation.

The initial ratio is 0.028075 / 0.0367 ≈ 0.765.

But the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation says that this ratio is 10^(pH - pKa2).

Ka2 is 6.2e-8, so pKa2 ≈ 7.208.

So, 0.765 = 10^(pH - 7.208)

Taking log on both sides:

log(0.765) ≈ -0.115

So, pH -7.208 ≈ -0.115 → pH≈ 7.208 - 0.115 → 7.093.

Wait, but that's the pH of the solution. So the solution is slightly basic.

But now, the orthophosphate concentration would be the concentration of HPO4^2-.

Wait, but wait. If the HPO4^2- comes from the dissociation of H2PO4^-, but also from the initial Na2HPO4·2H2O. So the total [HPO4^2-] would depend on the pH.

Wait, perhaps I should model the equilibrium.

Let me think: in the solution, the initial concentrations are [H2PO4^-] = 0.0367 M and [HPO4^2-] = 0.028075 M.

But when they are in solution, some H2PO4^- will dissociate into HPO4^2- and H+.

Let me denote x as the amount of H2PO4^- that dissociates.

So, the changes would be:

H2PO4^- → H+ + HPO4^2-

Initial:

[H2PO4^-] = 0.0367

[HPO4^2-] = 0.028075

[H+] = 1e-7 (approximate, but maybe better to keep as variable)

Change:

[H2PO4^-] decreases by x → 0.0367 -x

[HPO4^2-] increases by x → 0.028075 + x

[H+] increases by x → 1e-7 + x ≈ x (since x is much larger than 1e-7, maybe. Not sure.)

The Ka2 expression is:

Ka2 = [H+][HPO4^2-] / [H2PO4^-] = 6.2e-8.

So,

6.2e-8 = (x)(0.028075 + x) / (0.0367 - x)

Hmm, since Ka is small, x would be small compared to 0.0367 and 0.028075, so approximations can be made.

Assuming x is much smaller than 0.028075 and 0.0367, we can approximate:

6.2e-8 ≈ (x)(0.028075) / 0.0367

So, solving for x:

x ≈ (6.2e-8 * 0.0367 ) / 0.028075

Calculate numerator: 6.2e-8 * 0.0367 ≈ 2.2854e-9

Divide by 0.028075: 2.2854e-9 / 0.028075 ≈ 8.14e-8

So x≈8.14e-8 M.

Wait, but that's the [H+]. So pH would be about 7.09.

But wait, the [HPO4^2-] is 0.028075 + x ≈ 0.028075 + 8.14e-8 ≈ 0.028083 M.

So the concentration of HPO4^2- is approximately 0.028083 M.

Wait, but the problem is asking for the concentration of orthophosphate ions. If orthophosphate is HPO4^2-, then the concentration would be around 0.028 M. But wait, this can't be right because the options are around 1e-7 M, which is much lower.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Because the problem says 'concentration of orthophosphate ions' and the options are all around 1e-7 M, which is much lower than the initial concentrations.

Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the term 'orthophosphate.' Let me think again. Wait, perhaps orthophosphate refers to H3PO4. But if that's the case, then in solution, H3PO4 would dissociate into H+ and H2PO4^-.

So, the concentration of H3PO4 would be minimal because it's a weak acid. But the solution here is a buffer of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, so the concentration of H3PO4 would be negligible.

Wait, so if orthophosphate refers to H3PO4, and it's at a very low concentration, perhaps in the order of 1e-7 M.

Alternatively, perhaps the orthophosphate is HPO4^2-, but why would the concentration be so low? Because in our calculation, [HPO4^2-] is about 0.028 M, but that's not matching the options.

Wait a minute, perhaps the 'orthophosphate' refers to the HPO4^2- ion, but in the solution, the total concentration of HPO4^2- is determined by the buffer system, but the problem is asking for the concentration of HPO4^2- in the solution.

Wait, but the initial concentrations from the salts are 0.0367 M H2PO4^- and 0.028075 M HPO4^2-, but after considering the dissociation, the HPO4^2- would be higher and H2PO4^- lower.

Wait, but in our earlier calculation, x was about 8.14e-8, which is negligible compared to 0.028075, so [HPO4^2-] remains approximately 0.028075 M.

But that's way higher than the options given, so I must have misunderstood the question.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the concentration of PO4^3-, which is the 'phosphate' ion. But the options are still in the 1e-7 range.

Wait, perhaps the problem is about the concentration of H3PO4, which is the orthophosphoric acid, but that's in very low concentration because it's a weak acid and dissociates.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is referring to the free HPO4^2- concentration, but considering the activity coefficients and other factors, but I don't think that's the case here.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the concentration of PO4^3- because it's the fully deprotonated form. But then, the concentration would be even lower because the third dissociation is much weaker (Ka3 is 1.8e-12).

Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to calculate the concentration of HPO4^2- in the solution, but considering that some of it comes from the initial salt and some from the dissociation of H2PO4^-.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Let me think about the solution as a buffer solution of H2PO4^- (acid) and HPO4^2- (base). The pH of the solution can be found using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.

Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

pH = pKa2 + log([base]/[acid])

Here, the base is HPO4^2-, and the acid is H2PO4^-.

So,

pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-])

We have [HPO4^2-] = 0.028075 M, [H2PO4^-] = 0.0367 M.

So,

log(0.028075 / 0.0367) = log(0.765) ≈ -0.115

So,

pH ≈ 7.208 - 0.115 = 7.093.

Now, with the pH known, perhaps I can find the concentration of HPO4^2-.

Wait, but I already have the concentrations from the salts. Unless the solution's pH affects how much H2PO4^- dissociates, but in reality, in the solution, the concentrations are determined by the buffer equation.

Wait, perhaps the question is not about the buffer, but about the solubility of the salts. But I don't think that's the case here because both salts are soluble in water.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about the concentration of HPO4^2- in the solution, which is 0.028 M, but the options are much smaller, so that's not matching.

Wait, perhaps I'm supposed to calculate the concentration of PO4^3-, which would be determined by the third dissociation step.

Ka3 is 1.8e-12, which is very small. So the concentration of PO4^3- would be negligible compared to HPO4^2-.

Wait, but the problem is asking for orthophosphate. Maybe orthophosphate is HPO4^2-, but in the solution, the total amount of HPO4^2- is 0.028 M, which is much larger than the options given.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think again. The problem says, 'concentration of orthophosphate ions.' I think I must have made a wrong assumption about what 'orthophosphate' refers to.

Wait, perhaps 'orthophosphate' refers to the ion HPO4^2- as ortho, but in the solution, some of it comes from the initial salt, and some from the dissociation of H2PO4^-.

Wait, but the initial amounts are fixed by the moles from each salt. So the total [HPO4^2-] is the sum of the HPO4^2- from the salt and the HPO4^2- formed from H2PO4^- dissociation.

Wait, but I think I'm complicating it. Let me approach it from another angle.

Each mole of KH2PO4 gives one mole of H2PO4^-.

Each mole of Na2HPO4·2H2O gives one mole of HPO4^2-.

So, the initial concentrations are:

[H2PO4^-] = 1.00 / 136.09 / 0.2 ≈ 0.0367 M

[HPO4^2-] = 1.00 / 177.99 / 0.2 ≈ 0.028075 M

The solution is a buffer with these concentrations.

The pH is approximately 7.093 as calculated earlier.

Now, the question is about the concentration of orthophosphate ions. If orthophosphate is HPO4^2-, then the concentration is 0.028075 M plus the amount formed from H2PO4^- dissociation.

Wait, but from the equilibrium calculation, x was about 8e-8 M, so adding that to 0.028075 M is about 0.028083 M. So the concentration is approximately 0.028 M, but the options are on the order of 1e-7 M.

So that's conflicting. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the term 'orthophosphate.'

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the concentration of H3PO4, which is the orthophosphoric acid. But in solution, H3PO4 is a weak acid and exists mostly in dissociated forms. So [H3PO4] would be very low.

Wait, but how to calculate that. Let me think.

The first dissociation is H3PO4 ↔ H+ + H2PO4^- with Ka1=7.5e-3.

The concentration of H3PO4 would be determined by the reverse of this, but in this solution, we have H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, so the [H3PO4] would be very low.

Wait, but the solution has a lot of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, so the reverse reaction from HPO4^2- to H3PO4 would be very unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the orthophosphate concentration refers to the sum of all phosphate species, but that would be [H3PO4] + [H2PO4^-] + [HPO4^2-] + [PO4^3-].

But that's not matching the options either.

Wait, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the concentration of HPO4^2- ions, but without considering the buffer and just calculating based on the moles from the salt.

In that case, [HPO4^2-] would be 0.028075 M, which is 2.8e-2 M, but that's not any of the options.

Wait, the options are about 1e-7 M. So perhaps I'm missing a step here. Maybe I need to calculate the concentration of orthophosphate ions considering activity or something else. Alternatively, maybe the problem is about the concentration of PO4^3-.

Wait, considering the third dissociation step:

HPO4^2- ↔ H+ + PO4^3-; Ka3 = 1.8e-12.

So, the concentration of PO4^3- would be [HPO4^2-] * Ka3 / [H+]

We have [HPO4^2-] ≈ 0.028075 M, and [H+] from pH 7.093 is about 8.14e-8 M.

So,

[PO4^3-] = (0.028075 * 1.8e-12) / (8.14e-8).

Calculate numerator: 0.028075 * 1.8e-12 ≈ 5.0535e-14.

Divide by 8.14e-8: 5.0535e-14 / 8.14e-8 ≈ 6.207e-7 M.

Hmm, that's option A: 6.24e-7 M.

So, the concentration of PO4^3- is approximately 6.2e-7 M.

But wait, the question is about orthophosphate ions. If orthophosphate refers to PO4^3-, then the answer would be around 6.2e-7 M. That matches option A.

But I'm not entirely confident about the terminology. Another possibility is that the orthophosphate is HPO4^2-, but that doesn't fit with the options.

Wait, perhaps in some contexts, the orthophosphate ion refers to HPO4^2- when the solution is in a certain pH range, but in this case, we have a lot of HPO4^2- and H2PO4^-.

But if the question is about the concentration of PO4^3-, which is minimal, then the calculation I did gives about 6.2e-7 M, which is option A.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the concentration of HPO4^2- considering the dissociation of H2PO4^-.

Wait, but earlier calculation gave [HPO4^2-] as about 0.028 M, which isn't among the options. So perhaps the confusion is about the definition of orthophosphate.

Another approach: perhaps the problem is asking for the concentration of HPO4^2- considering that it comes from the dissociation of both H3PO4 and H2PO4^-.

But given that the solution contains both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, it's a buffer, so the concentrations are determined by the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, and the individual concentrations are known.

Wait, but if the problem states that the solution contains 1.00 g of each salt, perhaps the question is about the concentration of the orthophosphate ion, which is HPO4^2-, but that's around 0.028 M, which is not matching options.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the concentration of HPO4^2- in the solution, but the options are given as 1e-7 M, which is way lower.

Wait, this is confusing. Let me think about the possible steps again.

1. Calculate moles of each salt:

   KH2PO4: 1.00g /136.09g/mol ≈ 0.00734 mol → [H2PO4^-] = 0.00734 / 0.2 = 0.0367 M

   Na2HPO4·2H2O: 1.00g/177.99g/mol ≈ 0.005615 mol → [HPO4^2-] = 0.005615 / 0.2 ≈ 0.028075 M

2. Determine the pH using Henderson-Hasselbalch:

   pH = pKa2 + log([base]/[acid]) = 7.208 + log(0.028075/0.0367) ≈ 7.208 + log(0.765) → 7.208 -0.115 → 7.093.

3. Now, calculate the concentration of PO4^3- using Ka3:

   Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-]

   Rearranged: [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+]

   [H+] = 10^(-pH) = 10^(-7.093) ≈ 8.14e-8 M.

   So,

   [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.028075 ) / 8.14e-8 ≈ (5.0535e-14) / 8.14e-8 ≈ 6.207e-7 M.

Which is approximately 6.2e-7 M, matching option A.

So, if the question is about PO4^3-, which is the fully deprotonated form, then the answer is A. But if it's about HPO4^2-, then it's much higher and not in the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is a typo, and the correct answer is the concentration of PO4^3-, which is option A.

So, I think the correct answer is option A: 6.24e-7 M.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions in the solution, we analyze the dissociation behavior of phosphate species and the given data:

1. **Moles of Salts**:  
   - For KH₂PO₄:  
     \[
     \text{Moles} = \frac{\text{Mass}}{\text{Molar Weight}} = \frac{1.00 \, \text{g}}{136.09 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.00734 \, \text{mol}
     \]  
     This contributes \([H_2PO_4^-] = \frac{0.00734}{0.2 \, \text{L}} = 0.0367 \, \text{M}\).  

   - For Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O:  
     \[
     \text{Moles} = \frac{\text{Mass}}{\text{Molar Weight}} = \frac{1.00 \, \text{g}}{177.99 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.005615 \, \text{mol}
     \]  
     This contributes \([HPO_4^{2-}] = \frac{0.005615}{0.2 \, \text{L}} = 0.028075 \, \text{M}\).  

2. **Buffer System and pH**:  
   The solution contains both \(H_2PO_4^-\) and \(HPO_4^{2-}\), forming a buffer. The pH is determined using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:  
   \[
   \text{pH} = \text{p}K_a2 + \log\left(\frac{[HPO_4^{2-}]}{[H_2PO_4^-]}\right)
   \]  
   Substituting values:  
   \[
   \text{p}K_a2 = -\log(6.2 \times 10^{-8}) \approx 7.208, \quad \frac{[HPO_4^{2-}]}{[H_2PO_4^-]} = \frac{0.028075}{0.0367} \approx 0.765
   \]  
   \[
   \text{pH} = 7.208 + \log(0.765) \approx 7.208 - 0.115 = 7.093
   \]  

3. **Concentration of \(PO_4^{3-}\)**:  
   The third dissociation step is:  
   \[
   HPO_4^{2-} \leftrightarrow H^+ + PO_4^{3-}, \quad K_a3 = 1.8 \times 10^{-12}
   \]  
   Using the expression for \(K_a3\):  
   \[
   K_a3 = \frac{[H^+][PO_4^{3-}]}{[HPO_4^{2-}]}
   \]  
   Rearranging for \([PO_4^{3-}]\):  
   \[
   [PO_4^{3-}] = \frac{K_a3 \cdot [HPO_4^{2-}]}{[H^+]}
   \]  
   Substituting values:  
   \[
   [H^+] = 10^{-\text{pH}} = 10^{-7.093} \approx 8.14 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{M}, \quad [HPO_4^{2-}] = 0.028075 \, \text{M}
   \]  
   \[
   [PO_4^{3-}] = \frac{(1.8 \times 10^{-12})(0.028075)}{8.14 \times 10^{-8}} \approx \frac{5.0535 \times 10^{-14}}{8.14 \times 10^{-8}} \approx 6.21 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
   \]  

4. **Interpretation of "Orthophosphate"**:  
   The term "orthophosphate" typically refers to \(PO_4^{3-}\), the fully deprotonated form of phosphate. Thus, the concentration of orthophosphate ions in the solution is approximately \(6.21 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}\), which matches option A.

**Answer: A**
