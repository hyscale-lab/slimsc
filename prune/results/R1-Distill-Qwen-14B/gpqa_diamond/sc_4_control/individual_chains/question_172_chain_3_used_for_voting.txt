Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, let me think. 

The question says that iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as those in star_2. Oh right, I remember that in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the excitation of atoms relates to the temperature of the star. The excitation here refers to the energy levels the atoms are in. 

Wait, so when atoms are in a higher energy level, that's called being excited, right? The number of atoms in a particular energy level depends on the temperature. The Boltzmann equation comes into play here. Oh yeah, the Boltzmann distribution equation.

The Boltzmann equation is something like (n_i / n_j) = (g_i / g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k*T) ), where n is the number of particles in each state, g is the statistical weight, E is energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is temperature.

In this scenario, the energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Let's denote the energy levels as E for each star. So for star 1 and 2, the excitation is different. The problem states that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited. So I think that means the population ratio is 2:1 between the two stars for a specific energy level.

Wait, but wait. The excitation being twice as much—does that mean the number of excited atoms is twice? Or the ratio of the excited state to the ground state is twice? I think it's the latter. So for star_1, the ratio of excited to ground state is twice that of star_2.

Let me clarify. Let's say the ground state is level 1 and the excited state is level 2. For star_1, the ratio (n2/n1) is twice that of star_2's (n2/n1). Or wait, actually, the question says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited"—so maybe the number of excited atoms is twice as much in star_1 compared to star_2. But I'm not entirely sure, but I think the ratio of the excited state to the ground state applies here. 

So let's model this. Let's say for star_1, the number of excited atoms (n2) is twice that of star_2's (n2'). So n2_1 = 2 * n2_2. But wait, no, the problem says "twice as excited in a specific energy level"—so perhaps the ratio for star_1 is twice that of star_2. So (n2/n1)_1 = 2 * (n2/n1)_2.

But wait, I think I should think in terms of the ratio of the populations. Let me denote the ratio for star_1 as R1 = n2_1 / n1_1, and for star_2 as R2 = n2_2 / n1_2. The question says R1 = 2 R2.

But wait, the energy levels are the same for both stars, right? The energy difference is the same, 1.38e-23 J. So E = 1.38e-23 J for both.

Then the Boltzmann equation for each star is:

R1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

R2 = (g2/g1) * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Wait, if the statistical weights (g2, g1) are the same for both stars, then they would cancel out when taking the ratio of R1 and R2.

So R1/R2 = exp( [ -ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) ] )

Because R1 = [g2/g1 exp(-ΔE/(k T1))] and R2 = [g2/g1 exp(-ΔE/(k T2))], so R1/R2 = exp( [ΔE/(k T2) - ΔE/(k T1)] )

Wait, let me compute R1/R2:

R1/R2 = [ (g2/g1 exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )) ] / [ (g2/g1 exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )) ]

The g2/g1 terms cancel, so R1/R2 = exp( [ΔE/(k T2) - ΔE/(k T1)] )

Which can be written as exp( ΔE/(k) [ 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ] )

But we know that R1 = 2 R2, so R1/R2 = 2.

So 2 = exp( ΔE/(k) [1/T2 - 1/T1] )

Take natural logarithm on both sides:

ln(2) = (ΔE/(k)) [ (1/T2) - (1/T1) ]

Wait, but the problem says the energy difference is 1.38e-23 J. Let me plug in the numbers. ΔE = 1.38e-23 J. What's k? Boltzmann's constant is 1.38e-23 J/K. Oh, that's convenient because ΔE is given as equal to k. Because 1.38e-23 J is exactly k (since k is approximately 1.38e-23 J/K).

So ΔE = k, because 1.38e-23 J is the value of k. So substituting:

ln(2) = (k / k) [ (1/T2) - (1/T1) ]

So ln(2) = [ (1/T2) - (1/T1) ]

Which can be rewritten as 1/T2 - 1/T1 = ln(2).

Hmm, let me rearrange this equation.

1/T2 - 1/T1 = ln(2)

Multiply both sides by T1 T2 to eliminate denominators:

T1 - T2 = T1 T2 ln(2)

Then, let's see, let me factor this:

T1 - T2 = T1 T2 ln(2)

Hmm, but how does that look in terms of the options given?

Looking at the options:

Option D says ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

Which would be ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) )

But from our equation, T1 - T2 = T1 T2 ln(2). So dividing both sides by (T1 T2), we get (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2), which is exactly option D.

Wait, but let me check my steps again. Because sometimes when you take ratios, you have to be careful which way the equation goes.

Wait, let me re-express the equation:

We had:

ln(2) = (1/T2 - 1/T1 )

Which is the same as ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

Yes, because 1/T2 - 1/T1 = (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2 )

So that's correct. So the correct equation is ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 ), which is option D.

Wait, but let me make sure that I didn't mix up T1 and T2 in the equation.

Because in the equation, 1/T2 - 1/T1 = ln(2), so that's (1/T2) = ln(2) + (1/T1 )

Wait, no, no. Let me compute 1/T2 -1/T1 = ln(2). So 1/T2 = 1/T1 + ln(2).

If I rearrange, 1/T2 - 1/T1 = ln(2). So the equation is correct.

So the equation becomes ln(2) = (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2 ), which is option D.

So the correct answer is D.

To determine the correct equation for the effective temperatures of the stars, we use the Boltzmann distribution, which relates the population ratio of atoms in different energy levels to the temperature. The Boltzmann equation is:

\[
\frac{n_2}{n_1} = \frac{g_2}{g_1} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT}\right),
\]

where \(n_2\) and \(n_1\) are the populations of the excited and ground states, \(g_2\) and \(g_1\) are the statistical weights, \(\Delta E\) is the energy difference between the levels, \(k\) is Boltzmann's constant, and \(T\) is the temperature.

For star_1 and star_2, the energy difference \(\Delta E\) is the same (\(1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}\)), and the statistical weights \(g_2/g_1\) are also the same for both stars. The problem states that the excitation of iron atoms in star_1 is twice that of star_2, meaning the population ratio \(n_2/n_1\) for star_1 is twice that for star_2. Let \(R_1 = n_2/n_1\) for star_1 and \(R_2 = n_2/n_1\) for star_2. Thus:

\[
R_1 = 2R_2.
\]

Using the Boltzmann equation, we write:

\[
R_1 = \frac{g_2}{g_1} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_1}\right),
\]
\[
R_2 = \frac{g_2}{g_1} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_2}\right).
\]

Taking the ratio \(R_1/R_2\), the statistical weights cancel:

\[
\frac{R_1}{R_2} = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right).
\]

Since \(R_1 = 2R_2\), we have:

\[
2 = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right).
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right).
\]

The energy difference \(\Delta E\) is given as \(1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}\), which matches the value of \(k\) (\(k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K}\)). Thus, \(\Delta E / k = 1\), and the equation simplifies to:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}.
\]

Rewriting this in terms of \(T_1\) and \(T_2\):

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

This matches option D. Therefore, the correct equation for the effective temperatures is:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]
