Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to parse through it step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it slow.

The problem says that |alpha> is the state of an electron, and it's proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. Hmm, so |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. So, they form the basis for our state vector.

First, I think I need to normalize this state. Because when the problem says it's "proportional," that usually means it's not necessarily normalized yet. So I have to find the normalization constant.

Let me denote |up> as |0> and |down> as |1> for simplicity. So the state is |alpha> = (1+i)|0> + (2-i)|1>. To normalize, I calculate the inner product of |alpha> with itself.

The inner product is (1-i)(1+i) + (2+i)(2-i). Let's compute each part.

First term: (1-i)(1+i) = 1^2 + (i)(-i) + 1i - i^2. Wait, actually, more accurately, (a + b)(a - b) = a² - b². Wait, no, that's for real numbers. Oh, wait, (a + b)(c + d) isn't the same. Let me compute it correctly.

(1 - i)(1 + i) = 1*(1) + 1*i - i*1 - i*i = 1 + i - i - i². Since i² is -1, this becomes 1 + 0 + 1 = 2.

Second term: (2 + i)(2 - i) = 2^2 - (i)^2 + 2*(-i) + i*2. Wait, maybe better to compute as (a + b)(a - b) = a² - b², but since a is real, wait no, a is complex? No, wait, 2 is real. So (2 + i)(2 -i) = (2)^2 - (i)^2=4 - (-1)=5.

Wait, no, because (a + b)(a - b) is a² - b² when a and b are real. But in this case, a is 2 and b is i. So, yes, it becomes 4 - (i)^2 = 4 - (-1) =5.

Adding the two terms together: 2 +5 =7. So the norm squared is 7, meaning the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). So |alpha> is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |0> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) |1>.

Now, the next part of the question is about measuring the particle in the eigenstates of an operator with matrix elements A_ij = ħ/2 if i≠j, and 0 otherwise. So the matrix is 2x2, I suppose, since it's spin-1/2.

Wait, what does this matrix look like? Let's think. The operator has A_ij = ħ/2 when i != j. So for a 2x2 matrix, the diagonal elements are zero, and the off-diagonal elements are ħ/2. So the matrix would be:

[ 0    ħ/2 ]
[ ħ/2  0 ]

Wait, no, wait. Because A_ij is for i != j. So for i=1 and j=2, and i=2 and j=1, the elements are ħ/2. Other elements (i=j) are zero. So yes, that's correct.

Wait, but in the basis of |0> and |1>, the standard basis, this matrix represents an operator. So what is this operator? It looks a bit like the Pauli X matrix scaled by something. The Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So our operator is (ħ/2) times the Pauli X matrix. Or, more precisely, (ħ/2) * σ_x.

Wait, because σ_x has elements [[0,1],[1,0]], so (ħ/2) σ_x would be that matrix. So the operator is (ħ/2) σ_x.

Now, the eigenstates of this operator would be the same as the eigenstates of σ_x, up to a scaling factor. Because if you multiply a matrix by a scalar, the eigenvectors remain the same, but the eigenvalues are scaled.

The eigenvalues of σ_x are +1 and -1. So the eigenvalues of (ħ/2) σ_x would be (ħ/2)(+1) = ħ/2 and (ħ/2)(-1) = -ħ/2. So the eigenstates are the same as those of σ_x.

The eigenstates of σ_x are (|0> + |1>)/sqrt(2) and (|0> - |1>)/sqrt(2). Let me denote them as |+x> and |-x>, respectively. So |+x> = (|0> + |1>)/sqrt(2), and |-x> = (|0> - |1>)/sqrt(2).

So the problem is asking for the probabilities of measuring the particle in each of these eigenstates (i.e., the probabilities of getting +ħ/2 and -ħ/2 when measuring the operator). Also, we have to find the average value of that operator.

So the state |alpha> is expressed in the computational basis (|0>, |1>). But to find the probabilities of measuring in the eigenstates of the operator, I need to express |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of the operator. Alternatively, since the operator is (ħ/2) σ_x, the measurement in its eigenbasis is equivalent to measuring σ_x and then scaling by ħ/2.

So first, I need to find the expansion of |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |-x>.

Let me write |alpha> as a linear combination of |+x> and |-x>.

|alpha> = c_+ |+x> + c_- |-x>

Compute c_+ and c_-.

Expressed in terms of |0> and |1>, |+x> is (|0> + |1>)/sqrt(2), and |-x> is (|0> - |1>)/sqrt(2).

So substitute into |alpha>:

|alpha> = c_+ (|0> + |1>)/sqrt(2) + c_- (|0> - |1>)/sqrt(2)

Group the terms:

= [ (c_+ + c_-)/sqrt(2) ] |0> + [ (c_+ - c_-)/sqrt(2) ] |1>

But from earlier, |alpha> is (1+i)|0> + (2 -i)|1>, normalized by 1/sqrt(7).

So, equating coefficients:

(1+i)/sqrt(7) = [ (c_+ + c_-) ] / sqrt(2)
(2 -i)/sqrt(7) = [ (c_+ - c_-) ] / sqrt(2)

Let me denote the two equations as:

Equation 1: (1+i)/sqrt(7) = (c_+ + c_-) / sqrt(2)
Equation 2: (2 -i)/sqrt(7) = (c_+ - c_-) / sqrt(2)

Let me solve Equations 1 and 2 for c_+ and c_-.

Let me add Equations 1 and 2:

(1+i + 2 -i)/sqrt(7) = (2 c_+)/sqrt(2)
(3)/sqrt(7) = (2 c_+ )/ sqrt(2)
So 3 / sqrt(7) = 2 c_+ / sqrt(2)
Multiply both sides by sqrt(2):
3 sqrt(2)/ sqrt(7) = 2 c_+
So c_+ = (3 sqrt(2)) / (2 sqrt(7)) ) = 3/(sqrt(14)) )

Similarly, subtracting Equation 2 from Equation 1:

(1+i - (2 -i))/sqrt(7) = (2 c_- ) / sqrt(2)
(1 +i -2 +i)/sqrt(7) => (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(7) = (2 c_- ) / sqrt(2)

So 2 c_- = [ (-1 + 2i) * sqrt(2) ] / sqrt(7)
c_- = [ (-1 + 2i) * sqrt(2) ] / (2 sqrt(7)) )

But let me compute c_+ and c_- again, perhaps by a better method.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute the inner products of |alpha> with |+x> and |-x>.

The probability of measuring +ħ/2 is |< +x | alpha >|², and similarly for |-x>.

So:

c_+ = < +x | alpha > = ( <0| + <1| ) / sqrt(2) ) * [ (1+i)|0> + (2 -i)|1> ) / sqrt(7) ]

So:

c_+ = [ (1+i) + (2 -i) ] / (sqrt(2) * sqrt(7) )

Because when you take the inner product, you get (1+i)(1) + (2 -i)(1) ) / sqrt(2)*sqrt(7).

Wait, no, more accurately:

< +x | alpha > = [ ( <0| + <1| ) / sqrt(2) ] * [ (1+i)|0> + (2 -i)|1> ) / sqrt(7) ]

So, compute each component:

The first term is (1+i) * (1) * (1/sqrt(2)) (1/sqrt(7)) ), because <0|0> is 1, and the rest is the product of coefficients.

Wait, no, more accurately, the inner product is:

[ (1) + (1) ] multiplied by the coefficients.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it step by step:

( <0| + <1| ) * ( (1+i)|0> + (2 -i)|1> ) = (1+i)*<0|0> + (2 -i)*<0|1> + (1+i)*<1|0> + (2 -i)*<1|1>.

Since <0|0> =1, <0|1>=0, <1|0>=0, <1|1>=1.

So this sum becomes (1+i)*1 + 0 + 0 + (2 -i)*1 = (1+i) + (2 -i) = 3 + 0i.

So c_+ = (3) / ( sqrt(2) * sqrt(7) ) ) = 3/(sqrt(14)).

Similarly, compute c_- = < -x | alpha >.

| -x > is (|0> - |1>)/sqrt(2), so:

< -x | alpha > = ( <0| - <1| ) / sqrt(2) ) * ( (1+i)|0> + (2 -i)|1> ) / sqrt(7) )

Inner product:

(1+i)*<0|0> + (2 -i)*<0|1> - (1+i)*<1|0> - (2 -i)*<1|1>

= (1+i)(1) + (2 -i)(0) - (1+i)(0) - (2 -i)(1)
= (1+i) - (2 -i)
= 1 +i -2 +i = (-1) + 2i.

So c_- = (-1 +2i) / ( sqrt(2)*sqrt(7) )

Now, the probabilities are |c_+|² and |c_-|².

Compute |c_+|²:

c_+ is 3/(sqrt(14)), so |c_+|² = (9)/(14) ≈ 0.642857.

Similarly, compute |c_-|²:

c_- = (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14).

The modulus squared is [ (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ] / 14 = (1 +4)/14 =5/14 ≈0.35714.

Wait, let me compute it correctly.

Wait, no: c_- is (-1 +2i) / sqrt(14), so modulus squared is [ (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ] / (14) = (1 +4)/14 =5/14 ≈ 0.357.

So the probabilities are approximately 9/14 ≈0.642857 and 5/14≈0.35714.

Wait, but let me check: 9/14 is approximately 0.642857, which is close to 0.64. But let me see the options.

Looking at the options:

Option A) 0.64, 0.36 and hbar /7.

Wait, 9/14 is approximately 0.642857 (because 9*100/14 ≈ 642.857). So the probabilities would be ≈0.6429 and ≈0.3571.

Looking at the options, option A has 0.64 and 0.36, which sum to 1.0, but our computed probability for the other state is 5/14 ≈0.3571, which is about 0.357, not 0.36. So perhaps there's a mistake here.

Wait, maybe I made a miscalculation in the inner product for c_+ and c_-.

Wait, let me recompute the inner product for c_+.

c_+ is < +x | alpha > = [ (1+i) + (2 -i) ] / (sqrt(2) sqrt(7)) )

Wait, 1+i plus 2 -i is 3, so yes, 3/(sqrt(14)).

So |c_+|² is 9/14 ≈0.642857.

c_- is < -x | alpha > = [ (1+i) - (2 -i) ] / ( sqrt(2) sqrt(7) )

Wait, no: earlier I thought c_- was (-1 +2i)/sqrt(14), but perhaps I made a mistake in the inner product.

Wait, let me recompute < -x | alpha >:

< -x | alpha > = [ (1+i) * <0|0> + (2 -i) <0|1> ] - [ (1+i) <1|0> + (2 -i) <1|1> ]

Which is (1+i)*1 +0 - 0 - (2 -i)*1 = (1+i) - (2 -i) )= 1 +i -2 +i = (-1 + 2i).

Yes, that's correct. So modulus squared is [ (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ] /14 = (1+4)/14=5/14≈0.3571.

So the probabilities are about 9/14 (~0.643) and 5/14 (~0.357). Now checking the options again.

Option D says 0.61 and 0.29. No. Option A has 0.64 and 0.36. But 5/14 is approximately 0.357, which is about 0.357. So 0.643 and 0.357. None of the options except A have 0.64 as the first, but A's second is 0.36. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the operator is different.

Wait, perhaps the operator isn't (ħ/2) σ_x. Let me double-check. The matrix elements are A_ij = ħ/2 when i != j. So the matrix is:

[0, ħ/2]
[ħ/2, 0]

Which is indeed (ħ/2) times the Pauli X matrix, which is correct.

So the eigenstates are |+x> and |-x>, as I thought.

So, the probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14. Let me compute these exactly in decimal:

9 /14 = 0.642857...
5/14 ≈0.357142...

Looking at the options, option A is 0.64 and 0.36. Hmm, but 9/14 is approximately 0.6429, which is 0.643, not 0.64 exactly. Similarly, 5/14 is approximately 0.357, which is 0.357, not 0.36.

Wait, but perhaps there's a miscalculation. Let me recheck the inner product.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the way the state is written. Wait, the given state is (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down>, and we're assuming |up> is |0> and |down> is |1>.

But when we compute < +x | alpha >, perhaps I made a mistake in the factors.

Wait, |alpha> is [ (1+i)|0> + (2 -i)|1> ] / sqrt(7) because we normalized it. So to compute < +x | alpha >, which is ( <0| + <1| ) / sqrt(2) ) multiplied by |alpha>.

So:

(1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i) * <0|0> + (2 -i) * <0|1> + (1+i) * <1|0> + (2 -i) * <1|1> ) ] * (1/sqrt(7)) )

Which is (1/sqrt(2)*sqrt(7)) [ (1+i) + (2 -i) ].

Which gives [ (3) ] / sqrt(14) → 3/sqrt(14).

So |c_+ |² is (9)/(14) → 0.642857.

Hmm. So the probabilities are approximately 64.29% and 35.71%, but the options don't have that exactly. Let me look at the given options again.

Option A: 0.64, 0.36 and hbar/7.

Wait, 0.64 is close to 9/14, which is 0.642857. Similarly, 0.36 is close to 5/14 (0.3571).

Wait, 5/14 is approximately 0.3571, which is 0.357, not 0.36. But perhaps the options have rounded the figures. So perhaps option A is the correct one for the probabilities.

Next, the average value of the operator.

The operator is (ħ/2) σ_x, which has eigenvalues ± ħ/2.

The expectation value is <alpha| A |alpha>.

Since A = (ħ/2) σ_x, the expectation value is (ħ/2) <alpha| σ_x |alpha>.

So compute <sigma_x> = <alpha | sigma_x | alpha>.

Sigma_x in the computational basis is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So the expectation value is (1/sqrt(7))² times the sum of the off-diagonal elements multiplied by the corresponding coefficients.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute <alpha | sigma_x | alpha> directly.

Expressed as: |alpha> = a|0> + b|1>, where a = (1+i)/sqrt(7), b = (2 -i)/sqrt(7).

Compute <alpha| sigma_x | alpha> = a* b* + b* a.

Because sigma_x swaps |0> and |1>. So sigma_x |alpha> = b|0> + a|1>.

Then <alpha| sigma_x | alpha> = a* b* + b a.

Wait, let me compute it step by step.

Compute <alpha| sigma_x | alpha>:

= (a* <0| + b* <1|) sigma_x (a |0> + b |1> )

= a* a <0| sigma_x |0> + a* b <0| sigma_x |1> + b* a <1| sigma_x |0> + b* b <1| sigma_x |1>.

Sigma_x |0> = |1>, sigma_x |1> = |0>.

So:

= a* a <0|1> + a* b <0|0> + b* a <1|1> + b* b <1|0>
= 0 + a* b *1 + b* a *1 + 0
= a* b + b* a.

So, sigma_x expectation is a* b + b* a.

Compute a and b:

a = (1+i)/sqrt(7)
b = (2 -i)/sqrt(7)

a* = (1 -i)/sqrt(7)
b* = (2 +i)/sqrt(7)

So,

a* b = [ (1 -i)/sqrt(7) ] * [ (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ] = (1 -i)(2 -i) / 7.

Similarly, b* a = [ (2 +i)/sqrt(7) ] * [ (1 +i)/sqrt(7) ] = (2+i)(1+i) /7.

Compute each:

(1 -i)(2 -i) = 2 -i -2i +i² = 2 -3i -1 = 1 -3i.

(2+i)(1+i) = 2(1) + 2i +i(1) +i² = 2 +3i -1 =1 +3i.

So a* b = (1-3i)/7, and b* a = (1+3i)/7.

Add them together: (1-3i +1 +3i)/7 = 2/7.

So <sigma_x> = 2/7.

Then the expectation value of A is (ħ/2) * (2/7) )= ħ/(7).

Wait, that's ħ/7. So the average value is ħ/7.

Looking at the options:

Option A: average is hbar /7.

Option B: 3 hbar / sqrt(7)

Option C: hbar / sqrt(7)

Option D: 2 hbar / sqrt(7)

So from the average value, the correct option is A.

Wait, but earlier calculations of the probabilities gave 9/14 and 5/14, which are approximately 0.6429 and 0.357. So the probabilities would be 0.643 and 0.357, but the option A lists 0.64 and 0.36 as probabilities, which is a close approximation. So perhaps the answer is option A.

Wait, but let me check the average value again.

Wait, I computed <sigma_x> as 2/7.

So A's expectation is (ħ/2) * (2/7) ) = ħ/(7). So that's correct.

So the average value is ħ/7, which matches option A. So the answer would be option A: 0.64, 0.36, and average hbar/7.

Wait, but wait, 9/14 is approximately 0.642857, which is 0.642857. So in the options, option A says 0.64 and 0.36. So the probabilities are 9/14 (~0.643) and 5/14 (~0.357), which are about 0.64 and 0.357, but the options have 0.36. Hmm, perhaps the options have rounded to two decimal places. So 0.643 is 0.64 when rounded to two decimals, and 0.357 is approximately 0.36.

So yes, option A would be the correct choice.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves determining the probabilities of measuring an electron in the eigenstates of a spin operator and calculating the average value of that operator. The state of the electron is given as proportional to \( (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \), where \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) are the eigenstates of the \( z \)-projection of the spin operator. The operator in question has a matrix representation \( A_{ij} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \) for \( i \neq j \) and \( A_{ij} = 0 \) for \( i = j \), which corresponds to \( \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_x \), where \( \sigma_x \) is the Pauli \( x \)-matrix.

### Step 1: Normalize the state
The given state is \( |\alpha\rangle = (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \). To normalize it, compute the inner product:
\[
\langle \alpha | \alpha \rangle = |1+i|^2 + |2-i|^2 = (1^2 + 1^2) + (2^2 + 1^2) = 2 + 5 = 7.
\]
Thus, the normalization factor is \( 1/\sqrt{7} \), and the normalized state is:
\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} |\uparrow\rangle + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} |\downarrow\rangle.
\]

### Step 2: Eigenstates of the operator
The operator \( A = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_x \) has eigenstates \( |+x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|\uparrow\rangle + |\downarrow\rangle) \) and \( |-x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|\uparrow\rangle - |\downarrow\rangle) \), with eigenvalues \( \frac{\hbar}{2} \) and \( -\frac{\hbar}{2} \), respectively.

### Step 3: Expand \( |\alpha\rangle \) in terms of \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \)
To find the probabilities of measuring the eigenstates \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \), compute the overlap coefficients:
\[
c_+ = \langle +x | \alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( (1+i) + (2-i) \right) \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}},
\]
\[
c_- = \langle -x | \alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( (1+i) - (2-i) \right) \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} = \frac{-1+2i}{\sqrt{14}}.
\]
The probabilities are the squared magnitudes of these coefficients:
\[
P(+x) = |c_+|^2 = \left( \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}} \right)^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.643,
\]
\[
P(-x) = |c_-|^2 = \left( \frac{-1+2i}{\sqrt{14}} \right)^2 = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.357.
\]

### Step 4: Average value of the operator
The expectation value of \( A \) is:
\[
\langle A \rangle = \langle \alpha | A | \alpha \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \langle \alpha | \sigma_x | \alpha \rangle.
\]
Using \( \sigma_x = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix} \), compute:
\[
\langle \alpha | \sigma_x | \alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{7} \left( (1+i)(2-i) + (2-i)(1+i) \right) = \frac{2}{7}.
\]
Thus:
\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \frac{2}{7} = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

### Step 5: Match with options
The probabilities are approximately \( 0.643 \) and \( 0.357 \), which round to \( 0.64 \) and \( 0.36 \) for practical purposes. The average value is \( \frac{\hbar}{7} \). These match **Option A**.

Answer: A
