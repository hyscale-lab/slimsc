Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). The question is asking for the energy when a nucleus X is moving at 0.96c. X is defined as Lithium with 3 neutrons. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, I need to figure out what nucleus X is. Lithium usually has 3 protons. If it has 3 neutrons, that would make it Li-6, right? Because 3 protons + 3 neutrons = 6 nucleons. So the mass number A is 6.

Now, the problem is about relativistic speeds, so I know I'll be dealing with relativistic mechanics. The speed is 0.96 times the speed of light. I remember that the energy of a relativistic particle is given by the gamma factor multiplied by the rest mass energy. So the formula should be E = gamma * m_0 * c².

But wait, what's gamma? Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Since v is 0.96c, I can plug that in. Let me calculate v²/c²: (0.96)^2 is 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of that is sqrt(0.0784). Let me think, sqrt(0.0784) is approximately 0.28 because 0.28^2 is 0.0784. So gamma is 1 / 0.28. Let me compute that: 1 divided by 0.28 is roughly 3.5714. Hmm, but wait, 0.28 is exactly 7/25, so 1/(7/25) is 25/7 which is approximately 3.5714. So gamma is about 3.5714.

Wait, maybe I should calculate it more accurately. 0.96 squared is 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root is sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28. So yes, gamma is 1/0.28 = 3.57142857... So approximately 3.5714.

Next, I need the rest mass energy of the nucleus. The nucleus is Li-6. The atomic mass of Li is about 6.941 g/mol, but wait, that's atomic weight. Wait, no, the atomic mass of a single Li-6 nucleus would be better. Oh, I think the mass of a single Li-6 nucleus is approximately 6 atomic mass units (u), but I need the exact value in kilograms or something else to compute energy in GeV.

Wait, 1 atomic mass unit (u) is approximately 1.66053906660e-27 kg. So for Li-6, the mass m0 is 6 u. So m0 = 6 * 1.660539e-27 kg = let's calculate that. 6 * 1.660539e-27 is about 9.963234e-27 kg.

But wait, I've heard that the rest mass energy of protons and neutrons can be approximated, but perhaps it's easier to look up the exact mass of Li-6. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects me to use the mass of the nucleus as the sum of the individual nucleons. Lithium-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. Each proton has a mass of about 1.007276 u, and each neutron is about 1.008665 u. So the total mass would be (3 * 1.007276) + (3 * 1.008665) u.

Calculating that: 3 * 1.007276 is 3.021828. 3 * 1.008665 is 3.025995. Adding them together gives 3.021828 + 3.025995 = 6.047823 u. So the mass of Li-6 is 6.047823 u. So m0 = 6.047823 u.

Wait, but perhaps the mass is given as an exact value elsewhere. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects me to use the mass of the nucleus as approximately 6 u since it's Li-6. Either way, perhaps I should proceed with the exact calculation.

Alternatively, another approach: the rest mass energy in GeV for a nucleus can be calculated using the conversion factor. 1 u is approximately 931.5 MeV/c². So m0 in GeV/c² is 6.047823 u * 931.5 MeV/u. Wait, but 931.5 MeV is 0.9315 GeV. So 6.047823 * 0.9315 GeV.

Let me compute that:

6.047823 * 0.9315 ≈ ?

6 * 0.9315 = 5.589.
0.047823 * 0.9315 ≈ 0.04462.
So total is approximately 5.589 + 0.04462 = 5.6336 GeV. Wait, but wait, that can't be right because each nucleon is about 1 GeV/c², so 6 nucleons would be about 6 GeV/c². Wait, 0.9315 GeV/u, so 6 u would give 6 * 0.9315 = 5.589 GeV. But since Li-6 is 6.0478 u, that's 6.0478 * 0.9315 = let's calculate more accurately.

6.047823 * 0.9315 = ?

Let me compute it step by step:

6 * 0.9315 = 5.589.
0.047823 * 0.9315 ≈ 0.044622.
Adding them gives 5.589 + 0.044622 = 5.633622 GeV.

So the rest mass energy m0 c² is approximately 5.6336 GeV.

Wait, but does the problem consider relativistic mass or rest mass? No, in the energy formula for a particle, the total energy is gamma * m0 c². So the kinetic energy would be (gamma - 1) * m0 c², but the question says the energy of the collider, which I think refers to the total energy (kinetic plus rest mass). Wait, no, the energy in particle physics when talking about the collider's energy is usually the kinetic energy per particle. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here. Let me think again.

Wait, no, the total energy (relativistic) includes both rest mass and kinetic. But sometimes colliders are described by their center-of-mass energy, but here the question is about the energy of the nucleus X, so it's likely the total energy, which is gamma * m0 c².

So the formula is E = gamma * m0 c².

We have gamma as approximately 3.5714, and m0 c² is approximately 5.6336 GeV. So multiplying 3.5714 * 5.6336.

Calculating that:

3 * 5.6336 = 16.9008.
0.5714 * 5.6336 ≈ let's compute 0.5 *5.6336=2.8168, and 0.0714 *5.6336≈0.4038. So 2.8168+0.4038=3.2206.
Adding to 16.9008 gives 16.9008 + 3.2206 = 20.1214 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is close. Wait, but perhaps my calculation was a bit approximate.

Alternatively, let me compute gamma more accurately. Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.9216) = 1/sqrt(0.0784). The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28 exactly, because 0.28^2 is 0.0784. So gamma is exactly 1/0.28 = 25/7 ≈ 3.57142857.

Now, the mass calculation: 6.047823 u * 931.5 MeV/u.

Wait, 6.047823 * 931.5 = let me compute that.

6 * 931.5 = 5589 MeV.
0.047823 * 931.5 ≈ 0.047823 * 930 ≈ 44.57 MeV. So total is 5589 +44.57 ≈ 5633.57 MeV, which is 5.63357 GeV.

So E = gamma * m0 c² = (25/7) * 5.63357 GeV.

Let me compute 25/7 *5.63357.

25/7 is approximately 3.57142857.

3.57142857 *5.63357:

Let me compute 3 *5.63357 =16.90071.
0.57142857 *5.63357:

Compute 0.5 *5.63357 =2.816785.
0.07142857 *5.63357 = approximately 0.4038 (since 0.07 *5.63357=0.394, and 0.00142857*5.63357≈0.008, so ~0.402).

So 2.816785 + 0.4038 = 3.220585.

Adding to 16.90071: 16.90071 +3.220585=20.121295 GeV.

Hmm, the options are:

A) 18.475 GeV
B) 23.069 GeV
C) 20.132 GeV
D)21.419 GeV

Wait, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is very close to our calculated value of approximately 20.1213 GeV. Hmm, but maybe I made an approximation error in the mass.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the exact value of m0 c² more precisely.

So m0 = 6.047823 u.

Each u is 931.5 MeV/c², so m0 c² is 6.047823 * 931.5 MeV.

Let me compute 6 *931.5 = 5589.

0.047823 *931.5 = ?

0.04 *931.5 =37.26
0.007823 *931.5 ≈ let's compute 0.007 *931.5=6.5205, 0.000823 *931.5≈0.766. So 6.5205+0.766=7.2865.

So 0.047823 *931.5 ≈37.26 +7.2865=44.5465.

So total m0 c² is 5589 +44.5465=5633.5465 MeV, which is 5.6335465 GeV.

Now, gamma is exactly 25/7 ≈3.57142857.

So 25/7 *5.6335465.

Let me compute 5.6335465 *25 = 140.8386625.

Then divide by 7: 140.8386625 /7 ≈20.1212375 GeV.

So approximately 20.1212 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is very close. The difference might be due to more precise values of the mass of Li-6 or more accurate calculation steps.

Wait, perhaps I should use more precise values for the atomic mass of Li-6.

Wait, more accurately, the exact atomic mass of Li-6 is about 6.0151222 u. Oh, wait, no! Lithium-6's exact atomic mass is actually known. Let me check.

Wait, I remember that the exact isotopic mass of Li-6 is about 6.015122 u. Let me confirm that: I think it's about 6.015122 atomic mass units.

So m0 =6.015122 u.

Then, m0 c² =6.015122 u *931.5 MeV/u =?

So 6 *931.5=5589 MeV.

0.015122 *931.5 = ?

0.01 *931.5=9.315
0.005122 *931.5=approx 4.765 (because 0.005 *931.5=4.6575, 0.000122 *931.5≈0.1135. So 4.6575+0.1135=4.771.)

So 9.315 +4.771=14.086 MeV.

So m0 c² is 5589+14.086=5603.086 MeV =5.603086 GeV.

Wait, that's a much more precise number. So m0 c² is approximately 5.603086 GeV.

Then, E =gamma * m0 c² =3.57142857 *5.603086 GeV.

Calculating that:

3 *5.603086=16.809258.

0.57142857 *5.603086 : Let's compute that.

0.5 *5.603086=2.801543.

0.07142857 *5.603086≈approx 0.402.

Wait, wait, 0.07 *5.603086=0.392216.

0.00142857 *5.603086≈0.007996.

So 0.392216 + 0.007996=0.400212.

So total for 0.57142857 *5.603086 is 2.801543 +0.400212=3.201755.

Adding to 16.809258 gives 16.809258 +3.201755=20.011013 GeV.

Wait, that's about 20.011 GeV. But none of the options exactly match. Wait, the options are C)20.132 and D)21.419.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake here. Wait, earlier I thought the mass of Li-6 was 6.047823 u, but that was if I added the individual protons and neutrons. But perhaps that's not the right approach. Alternatively, the exact mass of Li-6 is 6.015122 u, which would make the calculation come out to about 20.01 GeV, but that's not one of the options either.

Wait, perhaps I'm using the wrong approach. Let me think again. Oh wait, maybe I should use the exact formula for gamma and calculate with more precision.

Wait, let me recalculate gamma. Gamma is 25/7, which is exactly 3.5714285714.

Now, m0 c² is 6.015122 u *931.5 MeV/u.

Wait, 6.015122 *931.5 = let me compute this precisely.

Let me compute 6 *931.5 =5589.

0.015122 *931.5 = let's compute 0.01 *931.5=9.315.

0.005122 *931.5 = (0.005 *931.5)=4.6575 and (0.000122 *931.5)=0.11354.

So 4.6575 + 0.11354=4.77104.

So 9.315 +4.77104=14.08604.

So total m0 c² is 5589 +14.08604 =5603.08604 MeV=5.60308604 GeV.

Now, E =gamma * m0 c² =25/7 *5.60308604.

Calculating 5.60308604 *25 =140.077151.

140.077151 /7 =20.01102157 GeV.

Hmm, so it's approximately 20.011 GeV. But the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the mass.

Another approach: perhaps the nucleus is considered as a proton (since Li has 3 protons, but 3 neutrons, making it Li-6). But maybe the problem is considering the charge, but no, the mass is the same regardless of charge.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the mass of the entire nucleus, but perhaps the mass is given as 6.941 g/mol? No, that's the atomic mass for Li, but that's the average for all isotopes. For Li-6, the exact mass is about 6.015122 u.

Wait, perhaps the energy is calculated using the rest mass in terms of the proton mass. Let me think. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to consider the nucleus as a proton, but that's not correct because it's a nucleus with 6 nucleons.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this using the rest mass energy correctly.

Wait, another approach: using the exact formula for gamma and precise calculation.

Gamma = 25/7 ≈3.57142857.

m0 c² =6.015122 u *931.5 MeV/u =6.015122 *931.5 =5603.086 MeV =5.603086 GeV.

E =3.57142857 *5.603086.

Let me compute this multiplication more accurately.

3.57142857 *5.603086.

Let me compute this as (3 + 0.57142857) *5.603086.

3 *5.603086 =16.809258.

0.57142857 *5.603086:

0.5 *5.603086 =2.801543.

0.07142857 *5.603086: Let's compute this as (1/14) *5.603086.

Wait, 1/14 is approximately 0.07142857.

5.603086 divided by 14: 5.603086 /14 = 0.400220428.

So 0.5 *5.603086=2.801543.

0.07142857 *5.603086=0.400220428.

Adding these: 2.801543 +0.400220428 =3.201763428.

So total E =16.809258 +3.201763428=20.0110214 GeV.

Hmm, approximately 20.011 GeV.

But the options don't have this. The closest option is C)20.132 GeV. So perhaps I made a mistake in the mass. Let me check again.

Wait, perhaps the mass of Li-6 is 6.0479 u.

Wait, I'm getting conflicting information. Let me check an online source or a periodic table.

Wait, the exact mass of Li-6 is indeed 6.015122 u. So my earlier calculation should be correct.

So why is the result about 20.01 GeV, but the options don't have that. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the kinetic energy (K) instead of the total energy (E). The kinetic energy is (gamma - 1) * m0 c².

Let me compute that.

gamma is 3.57142857, so gamma -1 =2.57142857.

2.57142857 * m0 c² =2.57142857 *5.603086 GeV.

Let me compute that:

2 *5.603086=11.206172.
0.57142857 *5.603086=3.20176 (as before).
So total is 11.206172 +3.20176=14.407932 GeV.

That would be the kinetic energy, but the question asks for the energy of the collider, which is usually the total energy (relativistic energy), not just the kinetic. So the answer should be around 20 GeV.

Wait, looking at the options again. Option C is 20.132 GeV, which is close to my initial calculation of about 20.12 GeV when I used m0 c² as 5.633 GeV.

Ah, perhaps I made a mistake in the mass of Li-6. Maybe the correct mass is 6.047823 u. Let me recalculate with that.

So m0 c²=6.047823 *931.5 MeV.

6 *931.5=5589.

0.047823 *931.5 = let me compute:

0.04 *931.5=37.26.

0.007823 *931.5= let's compute 0.007 *931.5=6.5205, and 0.000823 *931.5= approx 0.767.

So 6.5205 +0.767=7.2875.

So 0.047823 *931.5=37.26 +7.2875=44.5475.

Total m0 c²=5589 +44.5475=5633.5475 MeV=5.6335475 GeV.

Now, E=gamma * m0 c² =3.57142857 *5.6335475.

Let me compute this precisely.

3*5.6335475=16.9006425.

0.57142857 *5.6335475.

0.5 *5.6335475=2.81677375.

0.07142857 *5.6335475: I'll compute it as (0.07142857=1/14) so 5.6335475 /14 = approx 0.402396.

So 2.81677375 +0.402396=3.21916975.

Adding to 16.9006425 gives 16.9006425 +3.21916975=20.11981225 GeV.

Which is approximately 20.1198 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is very close, and option D is 21.419 GeV.

So perhaps the correct answer is option C, 20.132 GeV.

Wait, but why is there a discrepancy between calculations using different mass values? Oh, because the exact mass of Li-6 isn't 6 u but around 6.015 u. So perhaps the problem expects me to use a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the nucleus as a proton. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense since it's a Li nucleus.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the mass of the nucleus in terms of protons and neutrons more accurately, including binding energy. But that complicates things, and I think the problem expects a straightforward calculation using the given data.

In any case, based on my calculations using the exact mass of Li-6 as 6.015122 u, the energy comes out to approximately 20.011 GeV, which isn't an option. But wait, that's if I use the exact mass, but perhaps the problem uses an approximate mass of 6 u, leading to 20.12 GeV, which is option C.

Alternatively, perhaps I made an error in the gamma calculation. Wait, let me confirm gamma again. v=0.96c.

Gamma =1/sqrt(1 -v²/c²)=1/sqrt(1 -0.96²)=1/sqrt(1-0.9216)=1/sqrt(0.0784)=1/0.28=3.57142857.

Yes, that's correct.

So perhaps the correct answer is option C, 20.132 GeV, and my earlier approximation using 6 u for the mass led to that. So I think the intended answer is option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) for a nucleus moving at 0.96c, we use relativistic energy principles. The nucleus in question is Lithium-6 (Li-6), which has a mass number \( A = 6 \) and an exact isotopic mass of \( m_0 = 6.015122 \, \text{u} \). The energy of a relativistic particle is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m_0 c^2
\]

where \( \gamma \) is the Lorentz factor:

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}
\]

### Step 1: Calculate \( \gamma \)
Given \( v = 0.96c \), we compute:

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.96)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.9216}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.0784}} = \frac{1}{0.28} = 3.57142857
\]

### Step 2: Convert \( m_0 \) to energy in GeV
The rest mass energy \( m_0 c^2 \) is calculated using the conversion factor \( 1 \, \text{u} = 931.5 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 = 0.9315 \, \text{GeV}/c^2 \). For \( m_0 = 6.015122 \, \text{u} \):

\[
m_0 c^2 = 6.015122 \times 0.9315 \, \text{GeV} \approx 5.603086 \, \text{GeV}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total energy \( E \)
Using \( E = \gamma m_0 c^2 \):

\[
E = 3.57142857 \times 5.603086 \, \text{GeV}
\]

Breaking this calculation into parts:

\[
3 \times 5.603086 = 16.809258 \, \text{GeV}, \quad 0.57142857 \times 5.603086 \approx 3.20176 \, \text{GeV}
\]

Adding these:

\[
E = 16.809258 + 3.20176 \approx 20.011 \, \text{GeV}
\]

### Step 4: Compare with options
The calculated energy is approximately \( 20.011 \, \text{GeV} \). Among the given options, the closest value is:

**C) 20.132 GeV**

This slight discrepancy may arise from rounding or approximations in the problem setup. Thus, the best match is:

**Answer: C**
