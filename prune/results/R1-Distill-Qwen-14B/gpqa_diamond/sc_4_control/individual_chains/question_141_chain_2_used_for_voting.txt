Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out how many possible organic products are formed when 1-bromobenzene-2-d is treated with NaNH2 in a condensed ammonia solvent. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that NaNH2 is a strong base, often used in dehydrohalogenation reactions, especially in aromatic substitution. Wait, but wait, the starting material is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. Oh, wait, benzene-2-d... that's like benzene with two substituents? Wait, no, wait. Maybe I'm getting the numbering wrong. 1-bromobenzene-2-d—so the benzene ring has bromine at position 1 and a deuterium at position 2? Or perhaps it's 1-bromo-2-deutero benzene. So, the structure is a benzene ring with a Br at position 1 and a D (deuterium) at position 2.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Oh, right, benzene is a six-membered ring, so positions 1 and 2 are adjacent. So, Br is at position 1, D at 2. That's the starting material.

Now, the reaction conditions are NaNH2 in condensed ammonia. I remember that NaNH2 is a strong base and a good nucleophile. In aromatic chemistry, when you have a bromide and a strong base, especially in a dehydrohalogenation context, elimination reactions can occur. But wait, in aromatic compounds, elimination would typically lead to a ring contraction or expansion, but benzene is a stable structure. Alternatively, maybe it's an aromatic substitution where the Br is removed.

Wait, another possibility is that this is a dehydrohalogenation, forming a double bond adjacent to the Br. But wait, benzene is already all double bonds. Oh, wait, wait. Maybe it's a ring expansion or the formation of a quinone structure? Or perhaps it's a Friedel-Crafts type reaction, but wait, NaNH2 is a strong base, not an acid catalyst. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Hofmann elimination type, but that's more for aliphatic amines.

Wait, maybe I should think about the mechanism. If the starting material is a bromobenzene derivative, perhaps the Br is leaving. But the solvent is condensed ammonia, which is a good nucleophile and can act as a base.

Wait, another thought: maybe this is a dehydrobromination, leading to the formation of a benzene ring with a double bond adjacent to the deuterium. Wait, but benzene is already a fully conjugated ring with alternating double bonds. So if we remove Br and form a double bond, perhaps that's not the case. Alternatively, maybe it's an aromatic elimination, but that's a bit unclear.

Wait, I think I'm mixing things up. Let me think about the structure again. So, 1-bromobenzene-2-d is bromine on carbon 1, and deuterium on carbon 2 of benzene. So, the substituents are adjacent. Now, treating with NaNH2 in ammonia. Hmm, perhaps this is a dehydrohalogenation, but in an aromatic context, that's tricky. Alternatively, perhaps it's a nucleophilic aromatic substitution.

Wait, but for nucleophilic aromatic substitution, the ring needs to be activated towards nucleophilic attack, typically by having strong electron-withdrawing groups. Bromine is an electron-withdrawing group, so maybe in this case, the ring is activated for substitution. But NaNH2 is a strong base, so maybe it's acting as a base rather than a nucleophile.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation, which would form a benzene ring with a double bond, but given benzene's structure, that might not be possible. Alternatively, maybe it's forming a meta-directing group.

Wait, another approach: when bromobenzene is treated with a strong base like NaNH2 in ammonia, it might undergo elimination to form a benzene ring with a double bond and some hydrogen (or deuterium) loss. But wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a Birch reduction, but that uses metals like Na or Mg in ammonia, and NaNH2 is different.

Wait, perhaps it's an elimination forming a diene or something, but benzene doesn't have that. Wait, maybe it's forming a benzannulene? No, that's a larger ring. Hmm, I'm getting stuck.

Wait, let me think about possible products. If the Br leaves, what would happen? Maybe it's a substitution where the NH2^- acts as a nucleophile, replacing Br. But in that case, we'd get an aminobenzene product. But wait, the solvent is condensed ammonia, which is aprotic. So if NaNH2 is present, perhaps the ring is deprotonated, but the ring is already activated for substitution.

Wait, but in nucleophilic aromatic substitution, the ring must be activated towards attack by a nucleophile. Bromine is an electron-withdrawing group, which makes the ring more susceptible to nucleophilic attack, but only in specific positions. So, if the ring has Br at position 1, and D at 2, perhaps substitution occurs at position 4 or 6, as meta positions relative to Br. Wait, but in that case, the product would be an amino group attached at those positions.

Wait, but the question is about possible products. So, number of possible products depends on the possible positions where substitution can occur.

Wait, but wait, in nucleophilic substitution on an aromatic ring with a single substituent (like Br), the incoming nucleophile attacks the position that's meta to the Br. So in bromobenzene, substitution would occur meta to Br, which is positions 3 and 5. But in our case, the starting material is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. So, the substituents are at position 1 and 2.

Wait, so the ring has Br at position 1 and D at position 2. So, the positions available for substitution would be positions 3,4,5,6. Wait, but wait, bromine is at 1, which is ortho to position 2 (which has D). So, the ring has Br and D adjacent.

So, when performing nucleophilic substitution, where would the nucleophile attack?

In nucleophilic aromatic substitution, the positions are typically activated by strong electron-withdrawing groups. The incoming nucleophile attacks the position that's ortho, para, or meta to the EWG. Or wait, I might be mixing up electrophilic and nucleophilic substitution.

Wait, in electrophilic substitution, the substituents activate or deactivate the ring. For nucleophilic substitution, the ring is usually deactivated by strong electron-withdrawing groups. So, in our case, Br is an electron-withdrawing group, which would deactivate the ring. But for nucleophilic substitution to occur, the ring must be activated, meaning it's electron-deficient, which Br does. So, perhaps the ring is activated for nucleophilic attack.

In such cases, the nucleophile attacks the position para to the EWG. So, in bromobenzene, the nucleophile would attack the position opposite to Br, i.e., position 4. But wait, that's for monosubstituted rings.

In our case, the ring has two substituents: Br at 1 and D at 2. So, the ring has substituents at positions 1 and 2. So, when NH2^- comes in as a nucleophile, where would it attack?

Hmm, perhaps the meta positions relative to Br are available. But with two substituents, the directing effects might be a bit more complex.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed via nucleophilic substitution. Maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation, but how?

Wait, another thought: perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation, where the Br leaves, and a double bond forms between C1 and C2. But wait, benzene already has all double bonds, so that might not be possible. Alternatively, maybe a ring contraction or expansion occurs, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: when bromobenzene is treated with a strong base like NaNH2, perhaps it undergoes elimination to form a benzene ring with a triple bond. Wait, like making a benzene ring with a triple bond, but that's an annulene. Alternatively, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation forming a benzyn intermediate. Oh, wait, benzynes are possible when you have a dihalobenzene undergoing dehydrohalogenation. But in our case, it's monobromobenzene with a deuterium. Wait, but I don't think that's possible because you need two leaving groups for a benzyne formation.

Wait, unless the deuterium is a leaving group as well. But D is not a good leaving group. Wait, but in the presence of a strong base like NaNH2, perhaps the D could be abstracted as a proton. Wait, but deuterium is less acidic than H, but maybe under strong basic conditions, it can be abstracted.

Wait, maybe the reaction is an elimination where both Br and D are removed, forming a triple bond. So, the Br is at position 1, D at 2. If both are lost, you'd form a triple bond between C1 and C2. But wait, benzene is a six-membered ring; removing two adjacent substituents and forming a triple bond would create a triple bond between 1 and 2, making a cyclohexa-1,2-diene? No, wait, that's not possible because benzene has alternating double bonds. Alternatively, perhaps forming a triple bond would require a ring contraction, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the mechanism is different. Wait, another possibility: when a benzene ring has two substituents, like Br and D, and treated with a strong base, maybe the base abstracts a proton (or deuterium) adjacent to the Br, leading to the formation of a benzyn-like intermediate. But I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the possible products. If the reaction is a substitution, the NH2 group would replace the Br. But with two substituents, the positions for substitution might be limited.

Wait, in the starting material, positions 1 (Br) and 2 (D) are occupied. So the possible positions for substitution would be 3,4,5,6. But in nucleophilic substitution, the nucleophile attacks the position that's most activated, which is para or meta to the EWG.

In this case, the Br is at position 1, which is an EWG. So the nucleophile would attack either the para position (position 4) or the meta positions (3 and 5). But because the ring already has a substituent at position 2 (D), perhaps the attack is possible at positions 3,4,5,6.

Wait, but the presence of the D at position 2 may influence where the substitution occurs. Alternatively, perhaps the D is a hydrogen isotope and doesn't affect the reaction much.

Wait, perhaps the substitution occurs at position 4 (para to Br), but I'm not sure. If that's the case, then the product would be 4-aminophenyl with the D remaining at 2. But wait, would the D affect the substitution? Since deuterium is a heavier isotope, perhaps it affects the reaction, but in this case, it's probably just a substituent.

Alternatively, maybe the substitution occurs at position 3 or 5, which are meta to Br. So that would be two possibilities.

Wait, but what about the possibility of forming aniline (NH2 substitution) at different positions, but considering the existing substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is elimination, leading to the formation of a triple bond. So the Br and D are both eliminated, forming a triple bond between C1 and C2, creating a cyclohexyne ring, but I'm not sure if that's feasible. Alternatively, perhaps the ring opens, but that's unlikely.

Wait, another thought: maybe the reaction is dehydrohalogenation, where the Br leaves, and a hydrogen (or D) is abstracted, leading to the formation of a new double bond. But in benzene, all bonds are conjugated, so forming a new double bond may not change the structure significantly. Hmm, perhaps this isn't the right path.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a coupling reaction, but I don't think NaNH2 is a coupling agent.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic aromatic substitution where the NH2- replaces Br. In that case, the product would have NH2 at position 1, but wait, that's where the Br was. So the product would be 1-amino-2-d benzene. But that's a substitution, so only one product, but I'm not sure if that's the case.

Wait, but wait, in nucleophilic substitution, the incoming nucleophile can attack at certain positions, but in this case, the ring has two substituents. So perhaps the nucleophile can attack at multiple positions, leading to different products.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a H-D exchange. Since we're in a strongly basic environment, maybe the D at position 2 is replaced by a hydrogen from the NH2^- ion. But I'm not sure if that's favorable.

Wait, another possibility is that the reaction doesn't proceed as substitution but as elimination, forming a benzene ring with a triple bond. But I'm not confident about the feasibility.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a simple displacement, where the Br is replaced by NH2. So that would form 1-amino-2-d benzene. But since D is a substituent, perhaps the product is only one.

Wait, but the question is about the number of possible organic products. So perhaps only one product is formed. But wait, could there be more than one product?

Wait, maybe I should consider the possibility of ortho, meta, and para substitution. But in a nucleophilic substitution, the attack would typically be para to the EWG (Br). So in this case, the attack would be at position 4, leading to a product at position 4.

So, if substitution occurs at position 4, the product would be 1-amino-4-bromo-2-d benzene? No, wait, no. Wait, the Br is replaced by NH2. Wait, no, in substitution, Br leaves, so the product would be 1-amino-2-d benzene. Wait, but that would have NH2 at position 1 and D at 2. But that's only one product.

Wait, but wait, the starting material is 1-bromo, so substitution would replace Br with NH2, leading to 1-amino-2-d benzene. So that's one product.

But wait, perhaps the reaction can also involve D being abstracted, leading to different products. For example, if the D is removed as a proton, perhaps forming a ring contraction or something else. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to the formation of a benzene ring with two substituents: NH2 and D in different positions. But I'm not sure how that would happen.

Wait, another angle: when treating benzene derivatives with strong bases like NaNH2, sometimes elimination can occur, especially when there are adjacent leaving groups. But in this case, only Br is a good leaving group, and D is not. So perhaps elimination isn't feasible.

Hmm, maybe I should think about the possible products again. If the reaction is substitution, only one product is formed because the NH2 group replaces the Br. So, the product is 1-amino-2-d benzene.

Wait, but wait, could there be more than one possible substitution position? For example, perhaps the ring is symmetric, and substitution can occur in more than one position, leading to multiple products. But in this case, the substituents are at 1 and 2, which are adjacent, so the ring isn't symmetric. So substitution can occur only at specific positions.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation, leading to the formation of a diene or a triple bond. But that seems unlikely because benzene doesn't have the necessary structure for that.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a coupling, but I don't think so.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a benzidine rearrangement, but that's more about aromatic rings with amino groups.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction doesn't proceed, but that's not an option here.

Wait, perhaps the reaction leads to the formation of a benzene ring with NH2 group in a position that's either ortho, meta, or para to the D. But that may not be the case.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to think about this again. The starting material is 1-bromo-2-deutero benzene, treated with NaNH2 in ammonia. What happens? The NaNH2 is a strong base and a good nucleophile. In such conditions, perhaps the Br is replaced by NH2.

If that's the case, the product would have NH2 at position 1 and D at position 2, so that's one product.

But wait, could there be more than one product if the substitution can occur in different positions? Such as if the ring has more than one position activated for substitution.

Wait, perhaps the presence of the D at position 2 affects the substitution. But I don't think so; D is just a hydrogen isotope and doesn't influence the electronic effects much.

Alternatively, perhaps the substitution is possible at more than one position relative to the Br. For example, in bromobenzene, substitution occurs at para, leading to a single product. But in this case, with an adjacent substituent, perhaps substitution can occur at two different positions, leading to two products.

Wait, so maybe the substitution can occur at position 3 and position 5, which are meta to the Br. So that would give two different products: 3-amino-1-bromo-2-d benzene and 5-amino-1-bromo-2-d benzene. But wait, no, because the Br is leaving, so the product would be 3-amino-2-d benzene and 5-amino-2-d benzene. That would be two products.

Wait, but wait, in nucleophilic substitution, the incoming nucleophile attacks the position that's most activated. In bromobenzene, the nucleophile attacks para (position 4) because that's where the ring is most activated. But with an adjacent substituent (D at 2), perhaps the para position is not available, leading the attack to happen at meta positions.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Another possibility is that the substituents at positions 1 (Br) and 2 (D) make certain positions more activated than others.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents make the ring such that the nucleophile can attack at two different positions, leading to two products. So the number of products would be two.

But wait, let me think again. Nucleophilic aromatic substitution typically occurs when the ring is strongly activated towards nucleophilic attack, which is usually due to strong electron-withdrawing groups. The Br is an EWG, so it activates the ring for nucleophilic substitution.

In a monosubstituted benzene with Br, the nucleophile would attack para to Br. But in our case, there's a substituent (D) at position 2, which is ortho to Br. So, perhaps the attack occurs at position 4 (para to Br) and position 6 (meta to Br, but perhaps due to the substituent at 2, the attack is at position 6). Alternatively, maybe the attack can occur at positions 3 and 5, which are meta to Br.

Wait, so if substitution occurs at position 4, which is para to Br, that's one product. If substitution occurs at positions 3 and 5, which are meta to Br, then those are two more products. But wait, position 6 is meta to Br as well, but it's adjacent to the D at position 2. Hmm, maybe that's not favorable.

Alternatively, perhaps substitution is possible at positions 3,5, and 6, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the deuterium at position 2 doesn't hinder substitution at positions 3 and 5. So substitution could occur at positions 3 and 5, leading to two products. Plus, substitution at position 4. So that would be three products. But that seems a bit high. Alternatively, perhaps only one product is formed.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me try to visualize the benzene ring. Position 1 has Br, position 2 has D. So the ring looks like this:

1 (Br) — 2 (D) — 3
      \          /
        6 — 5
        /   \
       4 — 

Wait, no, that's not the correct representation. Let me imagine the benzene ring with positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 in order. So, position 1 is Br, position 2 is D. So, in that case, positions 3 and 6 are adjacent to position 2, and position 4 is across from position 1.

In nucleophilic substitution, the nucleophile would attack the position that's most activated. So, in bromobenzene, that's position 4. But with substituents at 1 and 2, the activation might be different.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent at position 2 (D) is an ortho substituent, which could influence the activation of the ring at other positions. Maybe the D at 2 doesn't strongly influence the substitution, so the nucleophile can attack at position 4, leading to one product.

But if there are other possible attack positions, maybe due to the presence of two substituents, perhaps multiple products are formed.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction isn't substitution but elimination, leading to the formation of a triple bond. But I'm not sure how that would happen.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about what NaNH2 does in such reactions. I recall that NaNH2 is used in the Birch reduction, but that typically involves aromatic rings with substituents that can direct the hydrogenation. Alternatively, NaNH2 can be used to dehalogenate certain structures.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the reaction is a single elimination, where the Br and D are removed, forming a triple bond between C1 and C2. But that would require both Br and D to leave, which is unlikely because D is a poor leaving group. So probably not.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation, removing H (or D) and Br to form a double bond. But since benzene is already a conjugated system, that's not feasible. So perhaps that's not the case.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck, but perhaps the correct approach is to conclude that only one product is formed, where the Br is replaced by NH2, leading to 1-amino-2-d benzene.

Wait, but the options include B) 1 and C) 2, so perhaps the correct answer is 1 product. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to multiple products due to different substitution positions. Let's think: in a meta-substituted scenario, perhaps the nucleophile can attack at two different positions, leading to two products. So the number of products would be two.

Wait, but if substitution occurs at positions 3 and 5, which are meta to Br, that would give two distinct products. So the number of possible organic products would be two.

But wait, how would the substituent at position 2 (D) affect this? Since D is adjacent to position 1 (Br), perhaps it doesn't influence the substitution positions as much.

Alternatively, perhaps the substitution can occur at position 4 (para to Br) and position 6 (meta to Br), leading to two products. But I'm not sure.

Wait, given that I'm getting a bit stuck, perhaps I should look for the correct answer in my notes or textbook. I remember that when a benzene ring has two substituents, the number of possible products can vary based on the reaction mechanism and directing effects.

In nucleophilic substitution, the substituents can direct the incoming nucleophile to specific positions. If the substituents are deactivating and meta-directing, then the nucleophile would attack the meta positions relative to the EWG.

In this case, Br is at position 1, D at 2. So, the possible meta positions would be 3,5, and perhaps 6. But considering the substituents, maybe only two positions are available.

Wait, but I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to only one product because the substitution can only occur in one position relative to the existing substituents.

In the interest of time, I'll conclude that the reaction leads to two possible products. So the correct answer is C) 2.


--- Final Answer Content ---


When 1-bromobenzene-2-d is treated with NaNH₂ in condensed ammonia solvent, the reaction involves nucleophilic aromatic substitution. The bromine atom at position 1 is a strong electron-withdrawing group (EWG), which activates the benzene ring for nucleophilic attack. The deuterium at position 2 is a substituent that does not significantly influence the electronic effects but occupies an adjacent position to the bromine.

In nucleophilic aromatic substitution, the incoming nucleophile (NH₂⁻) typically attacks the position that is most activated by the EWG. For bromobenzene, this is the para position (position 4). However, in this case, the substituents at positions 1 (Br) and 2 (D) create a scenario where substitution can occur at multiple positions. The nucleophile can attack at positions 3 and 5, which are meta to the bromine, leading to two distinct products. These products correspond to 1-amino-2-d benzene with the NH₂ group at positions 3 and 5, respectively.

Thus, the reaction produces two possible organic products due to the substitution occurring at two different meta positions relative to the bromine atom.
