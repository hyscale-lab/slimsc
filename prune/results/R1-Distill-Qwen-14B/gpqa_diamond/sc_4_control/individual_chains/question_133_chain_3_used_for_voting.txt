Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these kinds of questions. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The problem is about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution. The solution has a volume of 200.00 cm³, which is 0.2 liters. It contains 1.00 grams each of KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. The molar masses are given as 136.09 g/mol for KH2PO4 and 177.99 g/mol for Na2HPO4·2H2O. The temperature is 25°C. The Ka values for H3PO4 are provided: Ka1 is 7.5e-3, Ka2 is 6.2e-8, and Ka3 is 1.8e-12.

Hmm, I remember that when dealing with phosphate species, the different K_a values are crucial. Orthophosphate is HPO4^2- or PO4^3-? Wait, no, orthophosphate is H3PO4. But in solution, it dissociates into different forms based on pH. The species present are H3PO4, H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, and PO4^3-.

Wait, but in this problem, we're adding KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. So, KH2PO4 is K+ and H2PO4^-; Na2HPO4·2H2O would dissociate into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- (since Na is a spectator ion). So in solution, we have H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

I think the key here is that these two salts (KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4) will form a buffer solution because they're conjugate acid-base pairs. H2PO4^- can donate a proton to become HPO4^2-, so the buffer system is H2PO4^- / HPO4^2-.

Wait, but I'm supposed to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions. Oh, wait, orthophosphate is HPO4^2-? Or is it H3PO4? I think I might get confused here. Let me clarify: H3PO4 is the fully protonated form, which is the orthophosphoric acid. When it loses a proton, it becomes H2PO4^-, which is dihydrogen phosphate. Losing another gives HPO4^2-, which is hydrogen phosphate, and then PO4^3- is phosphate.

So, if the question is about orthophosphate ions, that's HPO4^2-.

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, sometimes 'orthophosphate' refers to the H3PO4, but in the context of solution, it's more likely the conjugate base. Hmm, but the problem states "orthophosphate ions", which I think would be PO4^3-? Or is it HPO4^2-? I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think again. Or maybe orthophosphate is HPO4^2- because that's the form in the salts given.

Looking at the salts: KH2PO4 dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^-. Na2HPO4·2H2O would give Na+ and HPO4^2- plus water. So in the solution, the main species are H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

So, the concentration of orthophosphate ions (if that's HPO4^2-) would be the concentration provided by the Na2HPO4 salt.

But wait, maybe the solution is more complicated. Because when these two salts are dissolved together, they might undergo some reactions. For example, maybe some H2PO4^- will deprotonate to form HPO4^2-, or vice versa, depending on the pH. So the presence of both might shift the equilibrium.

Alternatively, the buffer equation (Henderson-Hasselbalch) might apply here. Because we have a mixture of a weak acid (H2PO4^-) and its conjugate base (HPO4^2-), which forms a buffer.

So the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation would be pH = pKa2 + log([A-]/[HA]), where A- is HPO4^2- and HA is H2PO4^-.

Wait, but what is the pKa for the reaction H2PO4^- ↔ HPO4^2- + H+? That would be the second dissociation of H3PO4, so the Ka2 is 6.2e-8. So pKa2 is log(6.2e-8) ≈ 7.208.

Wait, but first I need to calculate the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- in the solution.

So, let's find the moles of each.

For KH2PO4: mass is 1.00g, molar mass 136.09 g/mol. Moles = 1.00 / 136.09 ≈ 0.00734 mol.

For Na2HPO4·2H2O: mass is 1.00g, molar mass 177.99 g/mol. Moles = 1.00 / 177.99 ≈ 0.00561 mol.

Wait, but the solution volume is 0.2 L, so concentrations would be:

[H2PO4^-] = 0.00734 mol / 0.2 L = 0.0367 M.

[HPO4^2-] = 0.00561 mol / 0.2 L = 0.02805 M.

Now, using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH:

pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-]) = -log(6.2e-8) + log(0.02805 / 0.0367).

Wait, let's compute the log terms. Let's compute each part.

First, pKa2 is -log(6.2e-8). Let me compute that:

log(6.2) ≈ 0.7924, so log(6.2e-8) is 0.7924 -8 = -7.2076. So pKa2 is 7.2076.

Then, the ratio [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] is 0.02805 / 0.0367 ≈ 0.7647.

log(0.7647) ≈ -0.1137.

So pH = 7.2076 + (-0.1137) ≈ 7.0939.

Wait, but we're being asked about the concentration of orthophosphate ions. If orthophosphate is HPO4^2-, then the concentration is 0.02805 M, but wait, because in solution, some of it might dissociate further, or some H2PO4^- might deprotonate into HPO4^2- based on the pH.

Wait no, the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation accounts for the ratio of the species at equilibrium. So the concentrations I calculated (0.0367 M H2PO4^- and 0.02805 M HPO4^2-) are the initial concentrations before any reaction. But in reality, some of each will convert to the other based on the pH.

Wait, but I'm getting myself confused. Maybe I should approach this differently. Let me think about the buffer solution.

After the salts are dissolved, the solution contains both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- in a certain ratio, which determines the pH. The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation gives the pH based on that ratio.

But the question is about the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which I think in this context refers to HPO4^2-.

Wait, but the initial moles are 0.00734 moles of H2PO4^- and 0.00561 moles of HPO4^2-. But in solution, they can interconvert. So the actual concentration of HPO4^2- will depend on the pH.

So perhaps the initial concentrations are not the actual concentrations. Let me think again.

The initial concentrations are:

[H2PO4^-]_initial = 0.0367 M,

[HPO4^2-]_initial = 0.02805 M.

But in solution, the system will adjust to a certain pH, which affects the ratio of these two ions.

So the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation comes into play here. The pH is determined by the ratio of the conjugate base (HPO4^2-) to the acid (H2PO4^-).

Alternatively, the pH is determined by the pKa2 and the ratio of the concentrations.

Wait, but once the pH is determined, the ratio of HPO4^2- to H2PO4^- will be 10^(pH - pKa2). Because H.H. equation is pH = pKa + log(base/acid), so base/acid = 10^(pH-pKa).

But wait, in our case, the system is a buffer, so the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- will adjust according to the pH. But how does that affect their actual concentrations?

Let me denote the concentrations after considering the buffer. Let me assume that the total concentration of both species is the sum of their initial concentrations. Wait, no, because when the salts dissolve, the total phosphate species would be the sum of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Wait, no. Wait, the initial moles from KH2PO4 is 0.00734 mol of H2PO4^-. The initial moles from Na2HPO4 is 0.00561 mol of HPO4^2-.

So the total moles of phosphate species is 0.00734 + 0.00561 = 0.01295 mol. The volume is 0.2 L, so the total concentration of phosphate species is 0.01295 / 0.2 = 0.06475 M.

But each phosphate species can interconvert based on pH. So let me think: the sum of [H2PO4^-] and [HPO4^2-] will be 0.06475 M, right? Because each mole of KH2PO4 provides one mole of H2PO4^-, and each mole of Na2HPO4 provides one mole of HPO4^2-.

Wait, but that's not exactly correct. Because some of the H2PO4^- can deprotonate into HPO4^2-, and some of HPO4^2- can protonate into H2PO4^-.

So the total concentration of phosphate species is 0.06475 M, but the individual concentrations depend on the pH.

But from the H.H. equation, [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] = 10^(pH - pKa2).

Let me let [HPO4^2-] = x, [H2PO4^-] = y.

So x + y = 0.06475.

And x/y = 10^(pH - pKa2).

But wait, I don't know pH yet. Alternatively, the pH can be found based on the initial ratio.

Wait, initially, before any reaction, x is 0.02805 M, y is 0.0367 M. The ratio is 0.02805 / 0.0367 ≈ 0.7647.

So log(0.7647) ≈ -0.1137.

So pH = pKa2 + log(x/y) = 7.2076 + (-0.1137) ≈ 7.0939.

So the pH is about 7.094.

Now, using this pH, we can find the ratio of HPO4^2- to H2PO4^-.

x/y = 10^(7.094 - 7.2076) = 10^(-0.1136) ≈ 0.7647, which is the same as the initial ratio. So that suggests that the initial concentrations are already in the ratio dictated by the pH, so no net reaction occurs. So the concentrations are as calculated initially.

Wait, that makes sense because when the initial concentrations are in the correct ratio, the pH is determined by that ratio, and there's no further shift. So in this case, the concentrations of HPO4^2- and H2PO4^- are 0.02805 M and 0.0367 M, respectively.

So the concentration of orthophosphate (HPO4^2-) is 0.02805 M? But wait, let me check the options.

Wait, the options are all on the order of 1e-7 M, which is much lower than what I just calculated. So that can't be right. I must be missing something.

Wait a minute, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. The question is about the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which is HPO4^2-, but perhaps in solution, it's further deprotonated or protonated. Wait, but the solution is neutral (pH around 7.094), which is close to the pKa2 of 7.2076. So the majority of the phosphate species should be in the H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- forms, with some possible PO4^3- but its concentration would be negligible because the pH is higher than pKa3.

Wait, but wait, the problem is about the concentration of orthophosphate ions. Could it be that the orthophosphate is actually H3PO4, which is the fully protonated form? But in solution, given the pH of about 7, it's not likely that H3PO4 is present in significant amounts because the first deprotonation happens easily.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the total concentration of all phosphate species, but that's not matching the options either.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the solution is more about the phosphate ions in the solution, considering the dissociation of the added salts.

Wait, but both the salts provide phosphate species. So if I'm to find the concentration of orthophosphate (HPO4^2-), it's simply the concentration from Na2HPO4, but perhaps I need to account for the fact that some of it might react with H2PO4^-.

Wait, why would that be the case? Because HPO4^2- can act as a base and accept protons from H2PO4^-.

Wait, but in this buffer solution, the concentrations are at equilibrium as dictated by the pH. So I think the initial approach was correct, but the problem is that the concentration of HPO4^2- is 0.02805 M, which is about 2.8e-2 M. But the options are all around 1e-7, which is much lower. That suggests that I must have made a mistake in my approach.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the concentration of HPO4^2- considering the dissociation of the salts. Alternatively, maybe the problem is about the actual concentration after considering the dissociation of HPO4^2- into PO4^3- and H+.

Wait, but HPO4^2- can dissociate further into PO4^3- and H+. The Ka3 is 1.8e-12, which is very small. So at pH 7.09, which is around 7.1, the concentration of PO4^3- would be very low.

The formula for the concentration is [PO4^3-] = [HPO4^2-] * Ka3 / [H+].

Wait, but perhaps the problem is asking for the concentration of PO4^3- as the orthophosphate ion. That would explain the low concentrations in the options.

Wait, that's possible. Because sometimes orthophosphate refers to the PO4^3- ion, especially in inorganic chemistry contexts. Let me think. So if that's the case, then orthophosphate is PO4^3-, and we need to compute its concentration based on the dissociation of HPO4^2-.

So the approach would be:

1. Find the concentration of HPO4^2- in solution.
2. Use the Ka3 to find the concentration of PO4^3-.

Let me proceed.

First, find [HPO4^2-].

Earlier, I thought [HPO4^2-] was 0.02805 M, but that may not be correct because the solution is a buffer. Let's reevaluate.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial assumption was wrong, and the [HPO4^2-] is lower because some of it dissociates into PO4^3-.

Wait, but considering that the pH is around 7.09, which is higher than pKa3 (which is about 11.2?), so PO4^3- would be minimal.

Wait, no, wait: pKa3 is for HPO4^2- ↔ PO4^3- + H+. The Ka3 is 1.8e-12, so pKa3 is about 11.74 (since log(1.8e-12) is about -11.74, so pKa3 is 11.74).

At pH 7.09, which is much lower than pKa3, the HPO4^2- will not dissociate much into PO4^3-.

So the concentration of PO4^3- would be very small. Let me compute it.

The formula is [PO4^3-] = [HPO4^2-] × (Ka3) / [H+].

We know that [H+] = 10^-pH = 10^(-7.094) ≈ 8.21e-8 M.

So [PO4^3-] = (0.02805) * (1.8e-12) / (8.21e-8).

Let me compute that.

First, 1.8e-12 divided by 8.21e-8 is (1.8/8.21) * 1e-4 ≈ 0.219 * 1e-4 = 2.19e-5.

Then multiply by 0.02805: 0.02805 * 2.19e-5 ≈ 6.11e-7 M.

Wait, that's about 6.1e-7 M, which is close to option A, which is 6.24e-7.

But wait, another thing: perhaps I should have used the actual [HPO4^2-] from the buffer solution, not the initial concentration.

Wait, because the buffer solution adjusts the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- based on the pH. So we can't just take the initial 0.02805 M as the [HPO4^2-]; we need to find the actual [HPO4^2-] after considering the buffer.

Hmm. Let's go through this again.

Total moles of phosphate species is 0.01295 mol, as previously calculated. The total concentration in 0.2 L is 0.06475 M.

The buffer equation is pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-]).

We calculated pH as approximately 7.094.

So [HPO4^2-] = [H2PO4^-] × 10^(pH - pKa2).

pH is 7.094, pKa2 is 7.2076.

So 10^(7.094 - 7.2076) = 10^(-0.1136) ≈ 0.7647.

So [HPO4^2-] = 0.7647 × [H2PO4^-].

Let [H2PO4^-] = a, [HPO4^2-] = 0.7647 a.

Total concentration: a + 0.7647 a = 1.7647 a = 0.06475 M.

So a = 0.06475 / 1.7647 ≈ 0.0366 M.

So [H2PO4^-] ≈ 0.0366 M, and [HPO4^2-] ≈ 0.7647 × 0.0366 ≈ 0.0280 M.

So [HPO4^2-] is approximately 0.0280 M.

Now, to find [PO4^3-], we use the expression:

PO4^3- = (Ka3 × [HPO4^2-]) / [H+].

Ka3 is 1.8e-12.

[H+] is 10^-7.094 ≈ 8.21e-8 M.

So PO4^3- = (1.8e-12 × 0.0280) / (8.21e-8).

Compute numerator: 1.8e-12 × 0.0280 = 5.04e-14.

Divide by 8.21e-8: 5.04e-14 / 8.21e-8 ≈ 6.137e-7 M.

So that's approximately 6.14e-7 M, which is close to option A (6.24e-7).

But wait, maybe I should be more precise with the calculations to get the exact value.

Let me recompute the exact values.

First, the pH calculation.

pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-]).

We have [HPO4^2-] = 0.02805 M, [H2PO4^-] = 0.0367 M.

So ratio is 0.02805/0.0367 = 0.7647.

Log(0.7647) = log(7.647e-1) ≈ 0.7647 is about 0.7647 in log.

Wait, more accurately: Let me compute log(0.7647).

We know that log(0.7) ≈ -0.1549, log(0.76) ≈ -0.1170, log(0.7647)=?

Using a calculator approach, perhaps this can be approximated as around -0.1137 as before.

So pH = 7.2076 - 0.1137 ≈7.0939.

So same as before.

Then, PO4^3- concentration:

(1.8e-12 * 0.02805) / (1e-7.0939) 

Wait, [H+] is 10^-pH = 10^-7.0939 ≈ 8.2e-8.

So 1.8e-12 * 0.02805 = 5.049e-14.

Divide by 8.2e-8: 5.049e-14 / 8.2e-8 = (5.049 /8.2 ) * 1e-6 ≈ 0.6157 * 1e-6 = 6.157e-7 M.

Looking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7, which is very close to this value.

But wait, perhaps I should calculate more accurately.

Let me calculate [H+].

pH =7.0939, so [H+] = 10^-7.0939.

10^0.0939 ≈ 1.24 (since 10^0.07918 is about 1.2, 10^0.1 is about 1.258; 0.0939 is closer to 0.095, so maybe around 1.24).

So 10^7.0939 = 10^7 * 1.24 = 1.24e7. So [H+] = 1 / (1.24e7) ≈ 8.06e-8 M.

Now, PO4^3- = (1.8e-12 * 0.02805) / (8.06e-8).

Calculate numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.02805 = 5.049e-14.

Denominator:8.06e-8.

So 5.049e-14 /8.06e-8 = (5.049 /8.06) * 1e-6 ≈ 0.6265 *1e-6 = 6.265e-7 M.

Hmm, that's approximately 6.27e-7 M, which is even closer to option A (6.24e-7). But option D is 3.97e-7, which is lower. So perhaps I'm making a miscalculation.

Wait, but wait. I think I messed up the calculation of [HPO4^2-]. Let me recheck.

Earlier, I found that [HPO4^2-] is 0.02805 M, but that's the initial concentration. But after the buffer equilibration, the actual [HPO4^2-] is 0.0280 M, as per the H.H. equation.

Wait, but in the buffer solution, the [HPO4^2-] is 0.0280 M, and we're using that to find PO4^3-.

Wait, but perhaps I was supposed to consider the initial moles and then use the buffer equation correctly.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this more accurately.

Let me recap:

Total moles of phosphate from KH2PO4 = 1.00g / 136.09 g/mol ≈ 0.00734 mol of H2PO4^-.

Total moles from Na2HPO4·2H2O = 1.00g / 177.99 g/mol ≈ 0.00561 mol of HPO4^2-.

So in 0.2 L, initial concentrations are:

[H2PO4^-] = 0.00734 / 0.2 = 0.0367 M.

[HPO4^2-] = 0.00561 / 0.2 = 0.02805 M.

The buffer system is H2PO4^- (weak acid) and HPO4^2- (conjugate base). The relevant Ka is Ka2 = 6.2e-8, so pKa2 = 7.2076.

Using H.H. equation, pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-]).

pH = 7.2076 + log(0.02805 / 0.0367) ≈ 7.2076 + log(0.7647) ≈ 7.2076 - 0.1137 ≈7.0939.

So the pH is 7.0939.

Now, the orthophosphate ion, which I'm now assuming is PO4^3-, is produced by the dissociation of HPO4^2-.

Ka3 = 1.8e-12, so pKa3 is 11.74.

The concentration of PO4^3- can be found using:

PO4^3- = (Ka3 × [HPO4^2-]) / [H+].

[H+]=10^-7.0939 ≈ 8.2e-8 M.

So,

PO4^3- = (1.8e-12 * 0.02805) / (8.2e-8) = (5.049e-14) / (8.2e-8) ≈6.157e-7 M.

Which is approximately 6.16e-7 M. Option A is 6.24e-7, which is very close. So I think that's the correct answer.

Wait, but I remember that when combining the salts, the total concentration of phosphate species is 0.06475 M, and the buffer equation gives [HPO4^2-] as 0.0280 M, which is correct.

So the calculated value of PO4^3- is approximately 6.16e-7 M, which is closest to option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO₄³⁻) in the solution, we analyze the dissociation of phosphate species in the buffer system formed by KH₂PO₄ and Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O. The solution contains 1.00 g of each salt, and the molar masses are given as 136.09 g/mol for KH₂PO₄ and 177.99 g/mol for Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O. The total volume of the solution is 200.00 cm³ (0.2 L), and the relevant dissociation constants for H₃PO₄ are Ka₁ = 7.5×10⁻³, Ka₂ = 6.2×10⁻⁸, and Ka₃ = 1.8×10⁻¹².

### Step 1: Calculate moles of phosphate species
- Moles of KH₂PO₄:  
  \[
  \text{Moles of H₂PO₄⁻} = \frac{1.00 \, \text{g}}{136.09 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.00734 \, \text{mol}
  \]
- Moles of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O:  
  \[
  \text{Moles of HPO₄²⁻} = \frac{1.00 \, \text{g}}{177.99 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.00561 \, \text{mol}
  \]

### Step 2: Initial concentrations of phosphate species
- \([H₂PO₄⁻]\):  
  \[
  [H₂PO₄⁻] = \frac{0.00734 \, \text{mol}}{0.2 \, \text{L}} = 0.0367 \, \text{M}
  \]
- \([HPO₄²⁻]\):  
  \[
  [HPO₄²⁻] = \frac{0.00561 \, \text{mol}}{0.2 \, \text{L}} = 0.02805 \, \text{M}
  \]

### Step 3: Use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find pH
The buffer system is H₂PO₄⁻ (weak acid) and HPO₄²⁻ (conjugate base), with Ka₂ = 6.2×10⁻⁸. The pKa₂ is:  
\[
\text{pKa}_2 = -\log(6.2 \times 10^{-8}) \approx 7.2076
\]
Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:  
\[
\text{pH} = \text{pKa}_2 + \log\left(\frac{[HPO₄²⁻]}{[H₂PO₄⁻]}\right)
\]
Substitute the concentrations:  
\[
\text{pH} = 7.2076 + \log\left(\frac{0.02805}{0.0367}\right)
\]
\[
\text{pH} = 7.2076 + \log(0.7647) \approx 7.2076 - 0.1137 = 7.0939
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the concentration of PO₄³⁻
Orthophosphate ions (PO₄³⁻) are formed by the dissociation of HPO₄²⁻:  
\[
\text{PO₄³⁻} = \frac{Ka_3 \cdot [HPO₄²⁻]}{[H⁺]}
\]
Here, \(Ka_3 = 1.8 \times 10^{-12}\), and \([H⁺] = 10^{-\text{pH}} = 10^{-7.0939} \approx 8.21 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{M}\). Substituting the values:  
\[
\text{PO₄³⁻} = \frac{(1.8 \times 10^{-12}) \cdot 0.02805}{8.21 \times 10^{-8}}
\]
\[
\text{PO₄³⁻} = \frac{5.049 \times 10^{-14}}{8.21 \times 10^{-8}} \approx 6.157 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

### Step 5: Compare with the options
The calculated concentration of PO₄³⁻ is approximately \(6.16 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}\), which is closest to option **A (6.24 × 10⁻⁷ M)**.

Answer: A
