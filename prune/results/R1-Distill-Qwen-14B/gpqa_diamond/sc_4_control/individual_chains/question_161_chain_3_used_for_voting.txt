Okay, so I've got this question about a transmission electron microscope setup. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of the concepts, but let me think through this step by step.

Alright, the scenario is Mike is designing a high-resolution TEM operating at 1000 kV. He uses vacuum pumps to get an ultra-high vacuum, like less than 10^-9 Torr. The idea is to minimize gas molecules because that improves electron microscopy by reducing scattering events, right?

But even with that vacuum, some gas particles are still there, as detected by a mass spectrometer. Mike calculated the mean free path of these gas molecules as λ1. Mean free path is the average distance a molecule travels between collisions, I remember. It depends on things like pressure, temperature, and the size of the molecules.

Then, when he starts the electron beam, he notices something interesting. The mean free path changes from λ1 to λ2. The temperature is the same, so that variable isn't changing. What's causing this change?

Wait, mean free path is given by the formula λ = 1/(√2 n π d²), where d is the mean collision diameter and n is the number density of the gas. Alternatively, another formula I've heard is λ = (k*T)/(√2 * π * d² * n), where k is Boltzmann's constant and T is temperature. Since the temperature is the same, any change in λ must be due to a change in n or d.

But wait, in this case, the pressure is the same because Mike already got it to ultra-high vacuum. So n, the number density, should stay the same, right? Because pressure P is proportional to n (since P = n k T, assuming ideal gas). So if pressure hasn't changed, n shouldn't change either.

Wait a second, but the presence of the electron beam might affect things. The electron beam is moving at a high voltage, so maybe it's causing some sort of ionization or heating? Or perhaps the electrons are interacting with the gas molecules.

Ah, wait, in the presence of an electron beam, gas molecules can get charged. If they become ionized, their mean free path can change. Because ionized particles would interact differently with the electron beam and with each other. For example, ions might have a longer mean free path because they might not collide as often as neutral molecules. Or wait, maybe it's the opposite.

Wait, when gas molecules are ionized, their number density for neutral molecules decreases, but the number of ions increases. But wait, the electron beam itself might cause the gas to partially ionize. So the neutral gas molecules' number density would decrease. Because some are now ions.

So if n decreases, because some gas particles are ionized and thus not contributing as neutrals, then the mean free path λ would increase. Because λ is inversely proportional to n. So if n goes down, λ goes up. So λ2 would be larger than λ1.

In that case, λ2 would be greater than λ1. So looking at the options, option A is λ2 >= 1.22 * λ1. Option C says λ2 is less than λ1, which contradicts our conclusion. Option D is between λ1 and 1.22 λ1, but if the effect is to increase, maybe it's more than 1.22? Or perhaps the factor is due to ionization.

Wait, but another angle: when you have charged particles (ions), the mean free path might be different. But wait, the question is about the gas molecules' mean free path. If ionization occurs, the gas molecules are ions, so their mean free path is perhaps longer because they might interact less frequently? Wait, no, because charged particles interact more strongly with each other, so maybe their mean free path is shorter. Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing.

Wait, let me think again. The mean free path λ1 was calculated under the assumption that the gas is neutral. When the electron beam is on, some of the gas molecules become ionized. So the neutral molecules' density n decreases, because some are now ions. But the ions themselves are part of the gas, but their presence affects the collisions of neutral molecules?

Alternatively, perhaps the mean free path of the gas molecules (neutral or ionized) is being considered. Wait, the question says, upon initiating the electron beam, the mean free path was based on electron scattering with the gas molecules. So maybe the electrons are scattering off the gas, which could be either neutral or charged.

But wait, in the initial state (without electron beam), the mean free path λ1 was for the gas molecules. But when the electron beam is on, gas molecules may become ionized. So if the number of neutral gas molecules decreases, their mean free path would increase. But the question is about the mean free path of the gas molecules, which now includes both neutral and ionized particles.

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the electron beam causes the gas to become ionized. So the total number of gas particles (neutral plus ion) remains the same, but the neutral number decreases. So for the neutral molecules, their mean free path would increase because n (neutral density) is lower. But if the question is about the gas in general, perhaps their mean free path is affected by ionization.

Wait, but the mean free path of the gas molecules (as a whole) might not change because the total number hasn't changed. But that doesn't make sense. Because when ionized, the gas particles are charged, and their collision dynamics are different.

Alternatively, perhaps the electron beam causes gas molecules to be ionized, and the ions have a longer mean free path because they don't collide as readily. But wait, charged particles have more electrostatic interactions, so perhaps their mean free path is shorter.

Wait, but the question is about the mean free path of the gas molecules. If gas molecules are ionized, their number as neutral would decrease, so the mean free path for the neutral fraction might increase. But the question is about the overall gas molecules' mean free path. Or maybe the presence of ions affects the electron beam's scattering, which is what Mike is observing.

Wait, the question states that Mike observed a change in the mean free path based on electron scattering with the gas molecules. So the electron beam interacts with the gas, and the scattering changes, implying that the gas is now more or less likely to cause scattering events.

If the mean free path λ is the average distance between collisions, a longer λ would mean that electrons can travel further without scattering. So if λ2 is longer than λ1, that would mean that the gas is less likely to cause scattering. But in reality, when the gas is ionized, the cross-section for electron scattering might change.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the electron mean free path. Oh wait, the question says Mike found that the mean free path of the gas molecules changed. Wait, no. Let me check: "He found that the mean free path was no longer equal to λ1; rather, it was λ2." So it's the mean free path of the gas molecules, not the electrons.

So the gas molecules' mean free path changed. So what affects the gas molecules' mean free path? As before, it's n and d. If n decreases, λ increases.

So why would n decrease? The presence of the electron beam may cause gas molecules to be ionized, thus reducing the number of neutral gas particles. So if n decreases, λ increases. So λ2 would be greater than λ1.

Therefore, λ2 > λ1. Looking at the options, option A says λ2 >= 1.22 λ1. Option C is smaller. So the correct conclusion is that λ2 is greater than λ1.

But wait, why would the presence of an electron beam cause the number of gas molecules to decrease? Because the electron beam is high-energy, perhaps it's causing some of the gas molecules to be expelled or to collide more, but that might not directly change n. Alternatively, the beam could cause ionization, but the total number of gas particles remains the same (ions and neutrals sum to the same as before). Wait, but the number density is the same because n is P/(kT), which is same. So why is λ changing?

Wait, this is confusing. Let me think again. The initial λ1 is calculated based on the pressure, temperature, and volume. When the electron beam is on, the temperature is the same. So perhaps the pressure hasn't changed, so n remains the same. Therefore, λ should remain λ1. But Mike's observation says it's changed. So either the pressure changed, or something else.

Wait, but the electron beam could cause some heating, but the question says the temperature remained the same. So that can't be it. Alternatively, the electron beam is causing gas to be pumped out or something, but the question says the pressure is still the same as before.

Wait, perhaps the electron beam causes gas ionization, but that doesn't change the number density of the gas. Because ionization converts some neutrals into ions but doesn't remove them. So n remains the same. Therefore, λ should remain λ1, but Mike's observation says it changed. That's conflicting.

Hmm, this is getting tricky. Maybe I'm missing something. Let me think about the initial scenario. The mean free path is λ1 when there's no electron beam. When the beam is on, the mean free path changes to λ2.

Wait, perhaps the presence of the electron beam causes gas molecules to be more likely to collide with the beam, which might alter their effective mean free path. Alternatively, the electron beam could cause additional scattering processes, which change the cross-section for collisions, thereby changing the mean free path.

Wait, perhaps it's about electron scattering cross-section. The mean free path is the average distance a particle travels between collisions. If the presence of the electron beam increases the cross-section for collisions (σ), then λ would decrease.

Because λ is inversely proportional to σ (since λ = 1/(n σ)). So if σ increases, λ decreases.

So why would σ increase? Because the electron beam is charged, so when a gas molecule (neutral or ion) interacts with the electron beam, the cross-section for scattering might increase. For example, ionized gas molecules may have a higher cross-section for scattering electrons because of their charge.

Wait, but in the initial state, when the electron beam is off, the gas molecules are neutral. When the beam is on, some become ionized. So the gas molecules are now charged, which could lead to more scattering events because charged particles interact more strongly with electrons. So the cross-section σ increases, leading to a decrease in mean free path λ.

So if σ increases, λ decreases. Therefore, λ2 would be less than λ1. So option C says λ2 < λ1.

Wait, but earlier I thought about the number density n, but if n is the same, then the change in λ would be due to σ changing. Because λ = 1/(n σ). So if σ increases, λ decreases.

So in this case, because the electron beam is causing the gas molecules to ionize, the cross-section for scattering electrons increases. Therefore, the mean free path of the gas molecules (as seen by the electrons) would decrease, making λ2 < λ1.

So the correct answer is option C: λ2 < λ1.

The scenario involves a high-resolution transmission electron microscope operating under ultra-high vacuum conditions (< 10⁻⁹ Torr). Mike calculates the mean free path of gas molecules in the vacuum state as λ₁. However, upon initiating the electron beam, he observes a change in the mean free path to λ₂, despite the temperature remaining constant.

The mean free path, λ, is inversely proportional to the number density, \( n \), and the effective cross-section for collisions, \( \sigma \), as described by the formula \( \lambda = 1/(n \sigma) \). Since the pressure and temperature remain constant, the number density \( n \) does not change. Therefore, any change in \( \lambda \) must be due to a change in \( \sigma \).

When the electron beam is turned on, high-energy electrons interact with the gas molecules. This interaction can cause ionization of the gas molecules, converting some neutral molecules into charged ions. Charged particles (ions) have a higher cross-section for scattering due to their electric charge, which increases the likelihood of collisions between gas molecules and the electron beam. As a result, the effective cross-section \( \sigma \) increases, leading to a decrease in the mean free path \( \lambda \).

Thus, the observed mean free path \( \lambda_2 \) is smaller than the initial mean free path \( \lambda_1 \), i.e., \( \lambda_2 < \lambda_1 \).

**Option Analysis:**
- **A) \( \lambda_2 \geq 1.22 \lambda_1 \):** Incorrect, as the mean free path decreases due to increased scattering cross-section.
- **B) \( \lambda_2 = \lambda_1 \):** Incorrect, as Mike's observation explicitly shows a change in the mean free path.
- **C) \( \lambda_2 < \lambda_1 \):** Correct, as the increased cross-section due to ionization reduces the mean free path.
- **D) \( \lambda_1 < \lambda_2 < 1.22 \lambda_1 \):** Incorrect, as the mean free path decreases, not increases.

The correct conclusion is that \( \lambda_2 < \lambda_1 \).
