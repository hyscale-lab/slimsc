Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says that there's a state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. The |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. So first, I need to normalize this state because it's proportional, meaning it's not necessarily of unit length yet.

Then, the problem asks about measuring the probability of the particle being in each eigenstate of another operator. The matrix representation of this operator has elements A_ij where A_ij is hbar/2 if i != j and 0 otherwise. Hmm, wait, that sounds a bit tricky. So for a 2x2 matrix, the diagonal elements are zero, and the off-diagonal elements are hbar/2. That would make the matrix look like:

[ 0, ℏ/2 ]
[ ℏ/2, 0 ]

I think this operator is related to the spin in the x-direction because the Pauli X matrix has 1s off-diagonal and 0s on the diagonal. But the given matrix here has ℏ/2 in the off-diagonal. Oh wait, the Pauli matrices are usually scaled so that their eigenvalues are ±1. The X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], right? So maybe this operator is (ℏ/2) times the Pauli X matrix. Because (ℏ/2) * X would give the matrix given here.

So the eigenstates of this operator would be the eigenstates of the Pauli X matrix. The eigenstates of X are |+x> and |-x>, which are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), respectively. So the states we're measuring are these |+x> and |-x> states.

The first task is to calculate the probabilities of measuring each of these eigenstates. To find the probability, I need to find the overlap between |alpha> and each of these eigenstates. Then square the absolute value of those overlaps to get the probabilities.

But wait, before that, I should normalize |alpha>. The given state is (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. Let's find the norm. The inner product of |alpha> with itself is (1+i)(1-i) + (2-i)(2+i). Because when you compute |a|² + |b|² for a vector a|up> + b|down>, assuming |up> and |down> are orthogonal.

Calculate (1+i)(1-i) = 1 +1 = 2 (since (1+i)(1-i)=1^2 - (i)^2 = 1 - (-1) = 2)

Then (2 -i)(2 +i) = 4 +2i -2i -i² = 4 - (-1) =5. So the squared norm is 2 +5 =7. So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). So |alpha> is [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ] |up> + [ (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ] |down>.

Now, the eigenstates of A are |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and |-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

So let's compute the inner product of |alpha> with |+x> and with |-x>.

First, inner product with |+x>:

< +x | alpha > = [ (1/sqrt(2)) (1, 1) ] ⋅ [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2-i)/sqrt(7) ] 

Wait, actually, in terms of components:

< +x | alpha > = (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1) * (1+i)/sqrt(7) + (1) * (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ) ]

Because <up|alpha> is (1+i)/sqrt(7) and <down|alpha> is (2-i)/sqrt(7).

So this becomes (1/sqrt(2))*( [1+i + 2 -i ] ) / sqrt(7) 

Simplify numerator: 1 +2 + i -i =3. So it's (3)/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(7)).

So the absolute value squared is (9)/(2*7) ) = 9/14.

Similarly, the inner product with |-x> is:

< -x | alpha > = (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1)*(1+i)/sqrt(7) + (-1)*(2 -i)/sqrt(7) ) ]

So that's (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i -2 +i ) / sqrt(7) ]

Simplify numerator: 1-2 = -1; i +i = 2i. So (-1 +2i).

So the inner product is (-1 +2i)/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(7)).

The absolute value squared is [ (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ] / (2*7) ) = (1 +4)/14 =5/14.

Wait, but wait: the sum of probabilities should be 1. Let's check: 9/14 +5/14 =14/14=1. So that's correct.

So the probabilities are 9/14 ≈0.6429 and 5/14≈0.3571.

Looking at the options, option A gives 0.64 and 0.36, which are close to these. Option D has 0.61 and 0.29, which are lower than these. So maybe option A's probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14, but looking at the options, option A is 0.64 and 0.36. Let me compute 9/14. 14 is approximately 2.857, so 9/14 is about 0.6428. So 0.64 is close. Similarly, 5/14 is about 0.357.

So the probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36. So the first two numbers in the options would be 0.64 and 0.36, which is option A.

Wait but let me look at the options again. Option A says 0.64, 0.36 and hbar/7. Hmm, but what is the average value of the operator?

The operator A has matrix elements A_ij = ℏ/2 if i≠j, else zero. So it's (ℏ/2)(|up><down| + |down><up| ). So in other words, A = (ℏ/2) (|up><down| + |down><up| ). Which is the same as (ℏ/2) times the Pauli X matrix.

Wait, the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so A is (ℏ/2) X.

The average value of A would be <alpha| A |alpha>.

Alternatively, since A is proportional to X, and since in the spin-x basis, the average would be the expectation value of X. Wait, but |alpha> is written in the z basis, so perhaps we need to compute <alpha| A |alpha> directly.

So compute <alpha| A |alpha>.

Expressed in the z basis, |alpha> is [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ].

A is a 2x2 matrix with zero diagonal and (ℏ/2) off-diagonal.

So A is:

[ 0, ℏ/2 ]
[ ℏ/2, 0 ]

So the expectation value is <alpha| A |alpha> = (1/sqrt(7)) (1+i, 2 -i)   * (A) * ( (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2 -i)/sqrt(7) )^T.

Wait, no. Let me compute it more carefully.

|alpha> is a column vector [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ]^T.

A is the matrix [[0, ℏ/2], [ℏ/2, 0]].

So A |alpha> is:

[ (0)(1+i)/sqrt(7) + (ℏ/2)(2 -i)/sqrt(7) ],
[ (ℏ/2)(1+i)/sqrt(7) + 0*(2 -i)/sqrt(7) ) ]

Which simplifies to:

[ (ℏ/2)(2 -i) / sqrt(7) ), (ℏ/2)(1 +i)/sqrt(7) ) ]

Then, <alpha| A |alpha> is the conjugate transpose of |alpha> multiplied by A|alpha>.

So let's compute the dot product:

[(1+i)/sqrt(7)*, (2 -i)/sqrt(7)* ] multiplied by [ (ℏ/2)(2 -i)/sqrt(7), (ℏ/2)(1 +i)/sqrt(7) ]

Wait, wait, no. The conjugate transpose of |alpha> is [ (1-i)/sqrt(7), (2 + i)/sqrt(7) ].

So the dot product is:

[(1 - i)/sqrt(7)] * [ (ℏ/2)(2 - i)/sqrt(7) ) ] + [(2 + i)/sqrt(7)] * [ (ℏ/2)(1 + i)/sqrt(7) ]

Compute each term:

First term: (1 - i)(2 - i) * (ℏ/2) /7.

Multiply (1 -i)(2 -i) = 2 -i -2i + i² = 2 -3i -1 = 1 -3i.

Second term: (2 + i)(1 +i) * (ℏ/2)/7.

Multiply (2+i)(1+i) = 2(1) + 2i +i(1) + i^2 = 2 +3i -1 =1 +3i.

So sum of terms: (1 -3i +1 +3i) * (ℏ/2)/7.

The imaginary parts cancel: 1 +1 =2.

So the expectation value is 2 * (ℏ/2) /7 = (ℏ/7).

Wait, that's interesting. So the average value is ℏ/7. So looking back at the options, option A says average is ℏ/7. So option A would be the correct choice.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation because it's easy to make a mistake with the signs and complex numbers.

First term:

(1 -i)(2 -i) = (1)(2) + (1)(-i) + (-i)(2) + (-i)(-i)
= 2 -i -2i + i²
= 2 -3i -1 (since i² = -1)
= 1 -3i.

Second term:

(2 +i)(1 +i) = 2*1 + 2*i +i*1 +i*i
= 2 +2i +i +i²
= 2 +3i -1 (since i² =-1)
= 1 +3i.

So when added:

(1-3i) + (1 +3i) = 2.

So the numerator is 2 * (ℏ/2) /7 → the (ℏ/2) comes from each term, so 2*(ℏ/2)/7 = (ℏ)/7.

Yes, that's correct. So the average is ℏ/7.

So the probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, and the average is ℏ/7. So looking at the options, option A says 0.64, 0.36 and hbar/7. So the answer is option A.

To solve the problem, we start by normalizing the given state \( |\alpha\rangle \), which is proportional to \( (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \). The norm is calculated as:

\[
\langle \alpha | \alpha \rangle = (1+i)(1-i) + (2-i)(2+i) = 2 + 5 = 7.
\]

Thus, the normalized state is:

\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} |\uparrow\rangle + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} |\downarrow\rangle.
\]

Next, the operator \( A \) has a matrix representation:

\[
A = \begin{bmatrix} 
0 & \frac{\hbar}{2} \\ 
\frac{\hbar}{2} & 0 
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

This corresponds to \( A = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_x \), where \( \sigma_x \) is the Pauli \( X \)-matrix. The eigenstates of \( A \) are the eigenstates of \( \sigma_x \), given by:

\[
|+x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|\uparrow\rangle + |\downarrow\rangle), \quad |-x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|\uparrow\rangle - |\downarrow\rangle).
\]

To find the probabilities of measuring \( |\alpha\rangle \) in \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \), we compute the overlaps:

1. **Overlap with \( |+x\rangle \):**

\[
\langle +x | \alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( (1+i) + (2-i) \right) \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}}.
\]

The probability is:

\[
P(+x) = \left| \langle +x | \alpha \rangle \right|^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.64.
\]

2. **Overlap with \( |-x\rangle \):**

\[
\langle -x | \alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( (1+i) - (2-i) \right) \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} = \frac{-1 + 2i}{\sqrt{14}}.
\]

The probability is:

\[
P(-x) = \left| \langle -x | \alpha \rangle \right|^2 = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.36.
\]

Finally, the average value of \( A \) is calculated as:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \langle \alpha | A | \alpha \rangle.
\]

Using the matrix representation of \( A \), we compute:

\[
\langle \alpha | A | \alpha \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \left( \frac{(1+i)(2-i) + (2-i)(1+i)}{7} \right).
\]

Simplifying the numerator:

\[
(1+i)(2-i) + (2-i)(1+i) = 2 - i + 2i - i^2 + 2 - i + 2i - i^2 = 4.
\]

Thus:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \frac{4}{7} = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

From the options, the probabilities \( 0.64 \) and \( 0.36 \), and the average value \( \frac{\hbar}{7} \), match **Option A**.

**Answer: A**
