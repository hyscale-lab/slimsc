Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius 2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity, but let's try to think this through.

The metric given is ds² = [32 / (4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Wait, that looks a bit like a conformally flat metric. Right, a conformal metric is one where the spatial part can be written as a function multiplied by the standard Euclidean metric. So in this case, the function is 32 divided by (4 - x² - y²), and it's multiplied by (dx² + dy²), which is the flat metric in 2D.

Wait, but the question is about the area of a pseudosphere of radius r=2. Hmm, pseudosphere—oh, right, a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature. But wait, the metric given here is in 2D, right? Because it's dx² + dy², so it's a 2-dimensional space. So maybe this is the metric of a pseudosphere in 2D, which is like the hyperbolic plane.

But wait, the question says 'pseudosphere of radius r=2'. Oh, wait, pseudosphere is usually a 3D surface, but in 2D, I think the term might refer to a hyperbolic plane. Or maybe it's a 2D surface with a constant negative curvature, which is what a pseudosphere is.

So the metric is in two dimensions. So the area would be an integral over the surface, right? The area in a metric is computed using the square root of the determinant of the metric tensor, multiplied by the usual area element.

Wait, for a 2D metric in the form ds² = g(x,y) (dx² + dy²), the area element dA would be sqrt(g) dx dy, where g is the determinant of the metric. Since this metric is diagonal and both components are the same, the determinant is just g_{xx} * g_{yy} = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] * [32/(4 - x² - y²)]? Wait, no, wait, no. Because the metric is diagonal, the determinant is (g_{xx})(g_{yy}) - (off-diagonal terms, which are zero here). So the determinant is (32/(4 - x² - y²))². Wait, no, wait. No, the metric tensor is diagonal with each component being 32/(4 - x² - y²). So the determinant is [32/(4 - x² - y²)]² because for a diagonal metric, determinant is product of the diagonal elements.

Wait, but the area element dA is sqrt(det g) dx dy. So sqrt of [32/(4 - x² - y²)]² is 32/(4 - x² - y²). So dA = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] dx dy.

Wait, but wait, the metric is written in terms of x and y, but the area would be over a certain region. The denominator is 4 - x² - y². So this term must be positive because the metric function is in the denominator, and we can't have it zero or negative because then the metric would be singular or imaginary.

So 4 - x² - y² > 0 implies that x² + y² <4. So the domain is a circle of radius 2 in the x-y plane. Oh, because radius squared is x² + y², so radius 2. So the region is a disk with radius 2.

So the area would be the integral over x and y where x² + y² <4 of [32/(4 -x² -y²)] dx dy.

Wait, but this integral might be tricky. Let me think about how to compute it.

Alternatively, maybe this is a standard form. Because when you have a metric like this, it's a conformal metric, and the area can be found by integrating the function over the allowed region.

But perhaps it's easier to switch to polar coordinates. Since the integrand is symmetric in x and y, polar coordinates would simplify things.

Let me set x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ. Then x² + y² = r². So the integral becomes:

∫ (from θ=0 to 2π) ∫ (from r=0 to 2) [32/(4 - r²)] * r dr dθ.

Because dx dy becomes r dr dθ. So the area is:

( ∫0^{2π} dθ ) * ( ∫0^2 [32 r/(4 - r²)] dr )

The θ integral is 2π. So the area is 2π * ∫0^2 [32 r/(4 - r²)] dr.

Let me focus on the radial integral: ∫ [32 r / (4 - r²)] dr from 0 to 2.

Hmm, substitution. Let u = 4 - r². Then du/dr = -2r → -du/2 = r dr.

So when r=0, u=4. When r=2, u=4 -4=0.

So the integral becomes ∫ [32 r dr / u ] = 32 ∫ [r dr / (4 - r²)] = 32 ∫ (r dr)/(u).

Substituting, we have:

32 ∫ [ (-du/2) / u ] from u=4 to u=0.

So the limits change from u=4 to u=0 when r goes from 0 to 2.

So the integral becomes:

32 * (-1/2) ∫ (u^{-1}) du from 4 to 0.

Which is 32*(-1/2) [ ln |u| ] from 4 to 0.

Wait, but if I flip the limits, the integral becomes positive. Let's reverse the limits and remove the negative sign:

32*(1/2) ∫ from 0 to4 (du/u) = 16 * [ln u ] from 0 to4.

Wait, but here's the problem. When u approaches 0, ln u approaches negative infinity. So the integral from 0 to4 of (1/u) du is divergent—it goes to infinity. Because ln(4) minus ln(0), which is negative infinity.

Wait, but in our case, the substitution steps: let me recheck.

Wait, the substitution for the radial integral:

We had ∫0^2 [32 r/(4 - r²)] dr = ∫4^0 [32 r/(u)] * (dr → -du/(2r)) )

Wait, let me write it properly:

∫ (32 r) / (4 - r²) dr from 0 to 2.

Let u = 4 - r² → du = -2r dr → r dr = - du/2.

So,

32 ∫ (r dr)/(4 - r²) = 32 ∫ ( (-du/2) ) / u ) = -16 ∫ du/u.

The limits when r=0 → u=4; r=2 → u=0.

So the integral becomes:

-16 ∫ from u=4 to u=0 (du/u) = -16 [ ln u ] from 4 to 0.

But integrating from 4 to 0, the negative sign flips the limits:

-16 [ (ln 0) - (ln4) ) ] → -16 [ ( -infty ) - ln4 ) ] → -16 ( -infty - ln4 ) → which is positive infinity.

Wait, but that would mean the integral is infinite. So the area is 2π multiplied by an infinite value.

So the area is infinite. Hmm. So the area of the pseudosphere of radius 2 is infinite.

Looking back at the options, option D is +infinite. So the answer would be D.

Wait, but let me think again—this is a hyperbolic plane, right? The metric given is that of the hyperbolic plane in isothermal coordinates. Wait, isothermal coordinates—wait, I remember that the hyperbolic plane has infinite area. Because it's a negatively curved space that extends infinitely. So the area is indeed infinite.

So the correct answer is D) +infty.

The given metric is 

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left(dx^2 + dy^2\right),
\]

which is a conformally flat metric in 2D. The task is to compute the area of the pseudosphere of radius \(r = 2\). 

### Key Observations:
1. The metric is defined for \(4 - x^2 - y^2 > 0\), which implies \(x^2 + y^2 < 4\). This corresponds to a circular region of radius 2 in the \(x\)-\(y\) plane.
2. The area element in this metric is given by \(dA = \sqrt{\det g} \, dx \, dy\), where \(\det g = \left(\frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2}\right)^2\). Thus, \(dA = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \, dx \, dy\).
3. To compute the total area, we integrate \(dA\) over the region \(x^2 + y^2 < 4\). Switching to polar coordinates (\(x = r \cos\theta\), \(y = r \sin\theta\)), the area becomes:

\[
A = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^2 \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \cdot r \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

4. The angular integral \(\int_0^{2\pi} d\theta = 2\pi\). The radial integral is:

\[
\int_0^2 \frac{32 \cdot r}{4 - r^2} \, dr.
\]

5. Using the substitution \(u = 4 - r^2\), \(du = -2r \, dr\), the radial integral becomes:

\[
\int_4^0 \frac{32}{u} \cdot \left(-\frac{du}{2}\right) = 16 \int_0^4 \frac{1}{u} \, du.
\]

6. The integral \(\int_0^4 \frac{1}{u} \, du\) diverges because \(\ln u\) approaches \(-\infty\) as \(u \to 0\). This indicates that the area is infinite.

### Conclusion:
The area of the pseudosphere of radius \(r = 2\) is infinite, as the integral over the region diverges. This result aligns with the properties of a hyperbolic plane, which has constant negative curvature and infinite area.
