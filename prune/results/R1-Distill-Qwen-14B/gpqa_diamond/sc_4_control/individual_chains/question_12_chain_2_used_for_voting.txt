Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. Hmm, it's about particle physics and conservation laws. Let me try to figure this out step by step. The question is about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles when a pion decays. 

The reaction given is Pi(+) → mu(+) + nu. The pion is at rest, which probably means its initial momentum is zero. So the products must have equal and opposite momenta to conserve momentum. Oh right, because the total momentum before is zero, so after, the sum should be zero too.

The rest masses are given: Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV, and mu(+) is 105.7 MeV. Wait, what about the neutrino? Oh, right, the neutrino's rest mass is considered negligible in these kinds of problems, I think. So we can treat it as massless, or at least much lighter than the muon.

So first, let's think about conservation of energy and momentum. The total energy before decay is just the rest mass of the pion, since it's stationary. So that's 139.6 MeV.

After decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino. The muon's energy will be its rest mass plus its kinetic energy, and the neutrino's energy is just its kinetic energy (since its rest mass is zero).

But wait, since the pion is at rest, the total momentum of the products must be zero. So the momenta of the muon and neutrino must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.

Let me denote the muon's momentum as p, and the neutrino's as -p. So the magnitudes are the same.

Now, using the energy-momentum relation for each particle. For the muon, E_mu = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2 ) / c^2? Wait, no, units probably in MeV, so maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think in terms of energy units where c=1.

So E_mu = sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2), and E_nu = p (since for massless particles, E=pc). 

So the total energy is E_mu + E_nu = sqrt(p^2 + (105.7)^2) + p. That should equal the pion's rest mass energy, 139.6 MeV.

So equation: sqrt(p² + (105.7)^2) + p = 139.6.

Hmm, solving for p. Let's let x = p for simplicity. So sqrt(x² + 105.7²) + x = 139.6. 

Let me write this as sqrt(x² + a²) + x = b, where a=105.7, b=139.6.

Subtract x from both sides: sqrt(x² +a²) = b -x.

Square both sides: x² + a² = (b -x)^2 = b² - 2b x + x².

Hmm, the x² terms cancel out. So:

a² = b² - 2b x.

Solving for x:

2b x = b² - a²

x = (b² - a²)/(2b)

Plug in the numbers: b is 139.6, a is 105.7.

Compute b²: 139.6^2. Let me calculate that. 140^2 is 19600, but 139.6 is 0.4 less. So (140 - 0.4)^2 = 140² - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4² = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19488.16.

a² is 105.7^2. Let's compute that. 100^2 is 10,000; 5.7^2 is 32.49. The cross term is 2*100*5.7=1140. So (100+5.7)^2 = 10000 + 1140 + 32.49 = 11172.49.

So b² - a² = 19488.16 - 11172.49 = 8315.67.

Divide by (2b): 2 *139.6 = 279.2.

So x = 8315.67 / 279.2.

Hmm, let's compute that. Let me see, 279.2 * 29 = 279.2*30=8376, subtract 279.2 → 8376-279.2=8096.8. That's 29*279.2=8096.8. But 8315.67 is a bit higher. So 29.8? Let me see, 29.8*279.2: 279.2 *30=8376, minus 0.2*279.2=55.84, so 8376-55.84=8320.16. Oh, wait, that's very close to 8315.67. Hmm, but 29.8 gives 8320.16, which is a bit higher than 8315.67.

Wait, maybe I should compute 8315.67 / 279.2 more accurately.

So 279.2 goes into 8315.67 about 29.8 times? Let me do the division step by step.

Compute 279.2 * 29 = 8096.8. Subtract that from 8315.67: 8315.67 - 8096.8 = 218.87.

Now, 279.2 * x = 218.87. x is 218.87 / 279.2 ≈ 0.782.

So total x ≈ 29 + 0.782 = 29.782. So approximately 29.78 MeV/c.

Wait, but wait, x is p, the momentum of the muon, which is in units where c=1, so p is in MeV/c. So p ≈ 29.78 MeV/c.

Now, the energy of the muon is sqrt(p² + m_mu²) = sqrt( (29.78)^2 + (105.7)^2 ). Let's compute that.

29.78 squared: 30^2 is 900, so 29.78 is 30 - 0.22. So (a-b)^2 = a² - 2ab + b². So 900 - 2*30*0.22 + (0.22)^2 = 900 -13.2 + 0.0484 = 886.8484.

105.7^2 is 11172.49 as before.

Total inside sqrt: 886.8484 + 11172.49 = 12059.34.

sqrt(12059.34) ≈ 109.81 MeV? Wait, wait. 109^2 is 11881, 110^2 is 12100. So 109.8^2 is (109 +0.8)^2 = 109² + 2*109*0.8 + 0.8^2 = 11881 + 174.4 +0.64= 12056.04. Oh, that's very close to 12059.34. So sqrt(12059.34) ≈ 109.8 + a little more.

The difference between 12056 and 12059.34 is 3.34. So each 0.1 increase in 109.8 adds about 2*109.8*0.1 + (0.1)^2 = 21.96 + 0.01=21.97. So 3.34/21.97 ≈ 0.152. So sqrt ≈109.8 + 0.152 = 109.95 MeV. So about 109.95 MeV for E_mu.

But wait, the neutrino's energy E_nu is p, which is ~29.78 MeV. So total energy is 109.95 +29.78 ≈ 139.73 MeV, which is close to 139.6 MeV. Hmm, perhaps a bit of approximating error, but that seems reasonable.

Now, the rest mass of the muon is 105.7 MeV, so the kinetic energy of the muon is E_mu - m_mu = 109.95 - 105.7 ≈4.25 MeV.

The neutrino's kinetic energy is E_nu =29.78 MeV. So the KEs are about 4.25 MeV and 29.78 MeV.

Looking back at the options. Let's see:

Option D: 4.12, 29.8

Hmm, that's close to what I calculated. So option D.

Wait, but let me check the initial calculation more accurately because I approximated some steps. Maybe I should compute p more accurately.

Wait, the equation was x = (b² -a²)/(2b). Let me compute that precisely.

b=139.6, a=105.7.

b²: 139.6 *139.6

Let me compute 139.6^2.

Compute 140^2=19600. 139.6 is 140 -0.4.

So (140 -0.4)^2 = 140² - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4² = 19600 - 112 + 0.16= 19600-112=19488; 19488 +0.16=19488.16.

a²=105.7^2.

Compute 105.7 *105.7.

Let me compute 105 *105 =11025.

(105 +0.7)^2 =105² + 2*105*0.7 + 0.7^2= 11025 +147 + 0.49= 11025+147=11172, 11172+0.49=11172.49.

So b² -a^2 = 19488.16 -11172.49 = 8315.67.

Divide by 2b: 2*139.6=279.2.

So x=8315.67 / 279.2.

Compute 8315.67 ÷ 279.2.

Let me compute 279.2 * 29 = 8096.8.

8315.67 -8096.8 = 218.87.

So 279.2 * y = 218.87 → y=218.87/279.2 ≈0.782.

So x= 29.782 MeV/c.

So p is approximately 29.782 MeV/c.

So E_mu = sqrt( (29.782)^2 + (105.7)^2 )

Compute 29.782^2:

29.78^2: let's compute 30^2 is 900, 29.78 is 0.22 less. So (30 -0.22)^2= 900 - 13.2 + 0.0484= 886.8484.

105.7^2=11172.49.

So E_mu^2=886.8484 +11172.49= 12059.3384.

sqrt(12059.3384)= let me compute it more accurately.

We know that 109.8^2=119.8^2 = ?

Wait, no: 109.8^2 = (110-0.2)^2=110² - 2*110*0.2 +0.2²= 12100-44 +0.04=12056.04.

But our number is 12059.3384.

So 12059.3384 -12056.04=3.2984.

Each 0.1 increase in x beyond 109.8 adds about 2*(109.8)*0.1 + (0.1)^2=21.96 +0.01=21.97 to x².

So to get 3.2984, how much do we need?

3.2984 /21.97 ≈0.15. So the sqrt is approximately 109.8 + 0.15=109.95 MeV.

So E_mu=109.95 MeV.

KE_mu= E_mu - m_mu = 109.95 -105.7=4.25 MeV.

E_nu = p=29.782 MeV.

So the KEs are approximately 4.25 MeV and 29.78 MeV.

Looking at the options:

Option D says KEs are 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV.

Hmm, my approximation gave 4.25 and 29.78. But the options have 4.12 and 29.8.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recheck.

Wait, let me compute x more accurately.

x = (b^2 -a^2)/(2b) = (19488.16 -11172.49)/(2*139.6) = 8315.67 / 279.2.

Let me compute 8315.67 divided by 279.2.

I can compute this more precisely.

Compute how many times 279.2 fits into 8315.67.

279.2 * 29 = 8096.8.

8315.67-8096.8=218.87.

Now, 218.87 /279.2 = ?

Let me compute 218.87 ÷ 279.2.

Compute 279.2 × 0.78 = ?

279.2 *0.7 =195.44

279.2 *0.08=22.336

Total 195.44+22.336=217.776.

Which is close to 218.87.

The difference is 218.87 -217.776=1.094.

So 0.78 gives 217.776; remaining is 1.094.

How much more? 1.094 /279.2 ≈ 0.003918.

So total y=0.78 +0.003918≈0.7839.

So x=29 +0.7839=29.7839 MeV/c.

So p=29.7839 MeV/c.

E_mu = sqrt( (29.7839)^2 + (105.7)^2 )

Compute 29.7839^2:

29.7839 squared: let me compute it more accurately.

29.7839 =29 +0.7839.

(29 +0.7839)^2 =29^2 + 2*29*0.7839 +0.7839^2.

29^2=841.

2*29=58; 58 *0.7839 = let's compute 58 *0.7=40.6; 58 *0.08=4.64; 58*0.0039=0.2262.

So 40.6 +4.64=45.24, +0.2262=45.4662.

0.7839^2: 0.7^2=0.49; 2*0.7*0.0839=0.11746; 0.0839^2≈0.00704. So total approximately 0.49 +0.11746=0.60746 +0.00704≈0.6145.

So 841 +45.4662=886.4662 +0.6145=887.0807.

105.7^2=11172.49.

So E_mu squared is 887.0807 + 11172.49 =12059.5707.

Compute sqrt(12059.5707). We know that 109.8^2=12056.04, as before.

12059.5707-12056.04=3.5307.

Each 0.1 of x beyond 109.8 adds about 21.96 to x^2. So 3.5307/21.96≈0.161.

So x≈109.8 +0.161=109.961. So E_mu≈109.961 MeV.

Thus, KE_mu=109.961 -105.7=4.261 MeV.

E_nu= p=29.7839 MeV.

So the kinetic energies are approximately 4.26 MeV and 29.78 MeV.

Looking at the options again:

Option D: 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV.

Hmm, the muon's KE is about 4.26, which is a bit higher than option D's 4.12. But let's think about the exact calculation again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of E_mu.

Wait, maybe I should use more precise values.

Wait, let me recalculate p.

x = (b² - a²)/(2b) = (19488.16 - 11172.49)/(2*139.6) = (8315.67) / (279.2).

Let me compute 8315.67 divided by 279.2.

Compute 279.2 * 29.782 = ?

Wait, 279.2 *29 =8096.8.

279.2 *0.782= let's compute 279.2 *0.7=195.44; 279.2*0.08=22.336; 279.2*0.002=0.5584.

So 0.7 gives 195.44; 0.08→ 22.336; 0.002→0.5584. So 195.44 +22.336=217.776 +0.5584=218.3344.

So 279.2 *29.782 = 8096.8 +218.3344= 8315.1344.

Which is very close to 8315.67.

So x=29.782 → 279.2 *29.782 =8315.1344.

The difference is 8315.67 -8315.1344=0.5356.

So 0.5356 /279.2 ≈0.001918.

So x=29.782 +0.001918≈29.7839, which is what I had before.

So p=29.7839 MeV/c.

E_mu = sqrt( (29.7839)^2 + (105.7)^2 ) = sqrt(887.08 + 11172.49) = sqrt(12059.57) ≈109.96 MeV.

Thus, KE_mu=109.96 -105.7=4.26 MeV.

E_nu=29.7839, so KE_nu=29.78 MeV.

Looking at the options, the closest is option D:4.12, 29.8.

But wait, none of the options match exactly. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider relativistic calculations more accurately, perhaps including the neutrino's energy and momentum.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the neutrino's energy. Since the neutrino's rest mass is considered zero, its energy is equal to its momentum (E=pc). So the total momentum is p_mu + p_nu =0 → p_nu = -p_mu. So their magnitudes are equal, p_mu = p_nu.

Wait, but in the calculation above, I used p_mu as x and p_nu as x as well. Wait, no, I think that's correct because p_mu is the magnitude of the muon's momentum, and p_nu is the neutrino's magnitude. So they are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction, leading to total momentum zero.

Wait, but in this case, the neutrino's momentum is p_nu= p_mu, because their directions are opposite. So in the calculation, the neutrino's energy is p_nu = p_mu = x.

Wait, but in earlier steps, I used E_mu = sqrt(x^2 + m_mu^2) and E_nu =x. So the total energy is E_mu + E_nu= sqrt(x² + m_mu²) + x = m_pi.

Which is correct.

Hmm, but the options don't have 4.26 and 29.78. Let me see the options again.

Option D:4.12 and 29.8.

Hmm, perhaps I should re-express the problem in terms of invariant mass or use conservation of four-momentum.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the decay in the rest frame, and use the formula for two-body decay.

Wait, for a decay of a particle at rest into two particles, the kinetic energy can be found using the formula for each product.

The formula for the kinetic energy of each product in the rest frame of the parent is:

KE = [ (M^2 - m1^2 - m2^2) / (2 M) ] * (1 ± (m1^2 - m2^2)/(M^2 - m1^2 - m2^2) )) )? Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to use the formula for KE in terms of the masses.

Wait, another approach: In the rest frame of the pion, the two decay products will have energies E1 and E2, and the sum of their energies is the pion's rest energy, M_pi =139.6 MeV.

For a two-body decay, the energies of the products can be found using the formula:

E1 = [ (M_pi)^2 + m1^2 - m2^2 ] / (2 M_pi )

E2 = [ (M_pi)^2 + m2^2 - m1^2 ] / (2 M_pi )

But wait, the neutrino's mass m2 is zero. So m2=0.

So E_mu = [ (139.6)^2 + (105.7)^2 -0 ] / (2 *139.6 )

Compute numerator: (139.6)^2 is 19488.16, (105.7)^2 is 11172.49. Sum is 19488.16 +11172.49=30660.65.

Divide by (2 *139.6)=279.2.

So E_mu =30660.65 / 279.2 → let's compute that.

30660.65 ÷ 279.2 → how much is that?

Well, 279.2 *109= 279.2 *100=27920; 279.2 *9=2512.8 → 27920+2512.8=30432.8.

Subtract from 30660.65: 30660.65 -30432.8=227.85.

Now, 279.2 *0.816= let's see:

0.8 *279.2=223.36.

0.016 *279.2≈4.4672.

So 0.816 → 223.36 +4.4672=227.8272.

Which is very close to 227.85.

So E_mu ≈109 + 0.816=109.816 MeV.

So E_mu=109.816 MeV.

The muon's kinetic energy is E_mu - m_mu = 109.816 -105.7=4.116 MeV.

The neutrino's energy is E_nu = (M_pi^2 - m_mu^2 )/(2 M_pi )

Wait, no, wait. Because in the two-body decay formula, E2 would be [ (M_pi^2 + m2^2 - m1^2 ) ] / (2 M_pi ), but m2 is zero.

Wait, no, in our case, the pion decays into mu and neutrino. So m1 is the muon's mass, m2 is the neutrino's mass (zero).

So E1 = (M^2 + m1^2 - m2^2 )/(2 M) ) → (139.6^2 +105.7^2 -0)/(2 *139.6) → same as before, 30660.65/(279.2)=109.816 MeV.

E2 = (M^2 + m2^2 - m1^2 )/(2 M) → (139.6^2 +0 -105.7^2 )/(2 *139.6 )

Compute numerator: 139.6^2=19488.16; 105.7^2=11172.49. 19488.16 -11172.49=8315.67.

Divide by (2 *139.6)=279.2 → 8315.67 /279.2≈29.78 MeV.

So E_nu=29.78 MeV.

So KE for the muon is E_mu - m_mu =109.816 -105.7=4.116 MeV. So approximately 4.12 MeV.

And KE_nu is E_nu =29.78 MeV.

So the KEs are 4.12 MeV and 29.78 MeV, which matches option D: 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we analyze the decay of a stationary positively charged pion, **π⁺**, into a positively charged muon, **μ⁺**, and a neutrino, **ν**. The reaction is:

\[
\pi^+ \rightarrow \mu^+ + \nu
\]

### Key Information:
- Rest mass of the pion: \( m_{\pi^+} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV} \)
- Rest mass of the muon: \( m_{\mu^+} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV} \)
- Neutrino mass: \( m_\nu \approx 0 \, \text{MeV} \)

### Conservation Laws:
1. **Energy Conservation**: The total energy before the decay (rest energy of the pion) equals the total energy after the decay (energy of the muon plus energy of the neutrino).
   \[
   E_{\pi^+} = E_{\mu^+} + E_\nu
   \]
   Since the pion is stationary, \( E_{\pi^+} = m_{\pi^+} c^2 = 139.6 \, \text{MeV} \).

2. **Momentum Conservation**: The total momentum before the decay is zero (pion is stationary), so the magnitudes of the momenta of the muon and neutrino must be equal and opposite:
   \[
   p_{\mu^+} = p_\nu
   \]

### Energy-Momentum Relation:
For the muon, the energy is given by:
\[
E_{\mu^+} = \sqrt{p_{\mu^+}^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2}
\]
For the neutrino, since its rest mass is negligible:
\[
E_\nu = p_\nu = p_{\mu^+}
\]

### Solving for Momentum:
Using energy conservation:
\[
E_{\mu^+} + E_\nu = m_{\pi^+}
\]
Substitute \( E_{\mu^+} = \sqrt{p_{\mu^+}^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2} \) and \( E_\nu = p_{\mu^+} \):
\[
\sqrt{p_{\mu^+}^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2} + p_{\mu^+} = m_{\pi^+}
\]
Let \( x = p_{\mu^+} \). The equation becomes:
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2} + x = m_{\pi^+}
\]
Subtract \( x \) from both sides:
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2} = m_{\pi^+} - x
\]
Square both sides:
\[
x^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2 = (m_{\pi^+} - x)^2
\]
Expand the right-hand side:
\[
x^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2 = m_{\pi^+}^2 - 2 m_{\pi^+} x + x^2
\]
Cancel \( x^2 \) from both sides:
\[
m_{\mu^+}^2 = m_{\pi^+}^2 - 2 m_{\pi^+} x
\]
Solve for \( x \):
\[
2 m_{\pi^+} x = m_{\pi^+}^2 - m_{\mu^+}^2
\]
\[
x = \frac{m_{\pi^+}^2 - m_{\mu^+}^2}{2 m_{\pi^+}}
\]

### Numerical Calculation:
Substitute \( m_{\pi^+} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV} \) and \( m_{\mu^+} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV} \):
\[
x = \frac{(139.6)^2 - (105.7)^2}{2 \cdot 139.6}
\]
Compute \( (139.6)^2 = 19488.16 \) and \( (105.7)^2 = 11172.49 \):
\[
x = \frac{19488.16 - 11172.49}{279.2} = \frac{8315.67}{279.2} \approx 29.78 \, \text{MeV}/c
\]

### Energy of the Muon:
The total energy of the muon is:
\[
E_{\mu^+} = \sqrt{x^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2}
\]
Substitute \( x = 29.78 \, \text{MeV}/c \) and \( m_{\mu^+} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV} \):
\[
E_{\mu^+} = \sqrt{(29.78)^2 + (105.7)^2} = \sqrt{886.85 + 11172.49} = \sqrt{12059.34} \approx 109.81 \, \text{MeV}
\]

The kinetic energy of the muon is:
\[
KE_{\mu^+} = E_{\mu^+} - m_{\mu^+} = 109.81 - 105.7 = 4.11 \, \text{MeV}
\]

### Energy of the Neutrino:
The neutrino's energy is equal to its momentum:
\[
E_\nu = p_\nu = x = 29.78 \, \text{MeV}
\]
Since the neutrino's rest mass is negligible, its kinetic energy is equal to its total energy:
\[
KE_\nu = E_\nu = 29.78 \, \text{MeV}
\]

### Final Answer:
The kinetic energies of the muon and neutrino are approximately \( 4.12 \, \text{MeV} \) and \( 29.8 \, \text{MeV} \), respectively. This matches **Option D**.
