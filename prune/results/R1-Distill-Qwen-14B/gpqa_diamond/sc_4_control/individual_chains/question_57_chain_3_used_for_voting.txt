Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about elastic scattering of electrons. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to work through it step by step.

The question gives me phase shifts for different l values: δ₀=90°, δ₁=67°, δ₂=55°, δ₃=30°, and δ₄=13°. The electrons are 50 MeV, and I'm supposed to ignore higher l values beyond these. The task is to find the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident direction.

Hmm, I remember that in scattering theory, the scattering amplitude f(θ,φ) can be expressed using phase shifts. The general form is something like:

f(θ, φ) = (1/(2ik)) Σ ( (2l+1) * e^{iδ_l} * (e^{iδ_l} - 1) * (Pl(cosθ)) ) )

Wait, no, maybe it's more precise to recall that the amplitude has a real and imaginary component. Oh right, the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude is related to the phase shifts.

Wait, the scattering amplitude f is given by:

f(θ,φ) = (1/(2ik)) Σ ( [ (2l+1) (e^{iδ_l} - 1) ] Pl(cosθ) )

And the imaginary part of f is the imaginary part of that expression. Oh wait, but wait, the amplitude is a complex quantity, and in many cases, especially for elastic scattering, the imaginary part is significant.

But the problem asks for the imaginary part along the incident beam direction. Wait, along the incident beam direction would mean θ=0 degrees, right? Because θ is the scattering angle measured from the incident direction.

So when θ=0, cosθ=1, and Pl(1) is 1 for all l. Because Pl(1)=1 for any l. That's a key point. So the amplitude at θ=0 would be the sum over l of (2l+1) * (e^{iδ_l} - 1) * (e^{iδ_l} ) / (2ik) ?

Wait no, let me think again. The general expression is:

f(θ, φ) = sum_{l=0}^∞ ( (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} (e^{iδ_l} - 1) P_l(cosθ) ) / (2ik) )

Wait, no, maybe it's written as:

f(θ,φ) = (1/(2ik)) sum_{l} (2l+1) [e^{iδ_l} (1 - e^{-2iδ_l}) ] P_l(cosθ) 

Wait, I'm getting confused. Maybe I should look up the formula for the scattering amplitude in terms of phase shifts. Oh right, the formula is:

f(θ, φ) = (1/(2ik)) sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l + 1) e^{iδ_l} (e^{iδ_l} - 1) P_l(cosθ) 

Wait, let me get that right. I think the correct expression is:

f(θ, φ) = (1/(2ik)) sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l + 1) [ e^{iδ_l} (e^{iδ_l} - 1) ] P_l(cosθ) 

But when we're considering the imaginary part, we can take the imaginary part of each term.

So, the imaginary part of f would be Im[f] = (1/(2k)) sum_{l} (2l+1) Im[ e^{iδ_l} (e^{iδ_l} - 1) ] P_l(1) 

Wait, but at θ=0, P_l(1)=1. So each term's P_l is 1.

So, Im[f] = (1/(2k)) sum_{l} (2l+1) Im[ e^{iδ_l} (e^{iδ_l} -1) ] 

Let me compute this. Let's compute the imaginary part of e^{iδ} (e^{iδ} -1) where δ is the phase shift for each l.

Wait, e^{iδ} is cosδ + i sinδ. So e^{iδ} (e^{iδ} - 1) = (cosδ + i sinδ)( (cosδ + i sinδ) - 1 )

Let me compute this product step by step.

Let me denote A = e^{iδ} = cosδ + i sinδ.

So A(A - 1) = (cosδ + i sinδ)(cosδ + i sinδ - 1 )

Expanding this:

= (cosδ)(cosδ -1) + (cosδ)(i sinδ) ) + (i sinδ)(cosδ -1) + (i sinδ)(i sinδ)

Hmm, but perhaps a better approach is to compute it as:

A(A-1) = A^2 - A 

A^2 = (cosδ + i sinδ)^2 = cos(2δ) + i sin(2δ)

So A^2 - A = [cos(2δ) + i sin(2δ)] - [cosδ + i sinδ]

So A(A-1) = [cos(2δ) - cosδ] + i [sin(2δ) - sinδ]

Therefore, the imaginary part of e^{iδ} (e^{iδ} -1) is sin(2δ) - sinδ.

So, the imaginary part of each term (2l+1) [e^{iδ_l}(e^{iδ_l} -1) ] is (2l+1)( sin(2δ_l) - sinδ_l )

Thus, Im[f] = (1/(2k)) sum_{l} (2l+1)( sin(2δ_l) - sinδ_l )

Hmm, but wait, let me check. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is Im( e^{iδ} (e^{iδ} -1) ) = Im( e^{i2δ} - e^{iδ} ) 

Which would be sin(2δ) - sinδ, as I have.

So that's correct.

So, the sum over l of (2l+1)( sin(2δ_l) - sinδ_l )

Then, multiply by 1/(2k)

But what is k here? k is the wave number of the electrons. The given energy is 50 MeV, which is the kinetic energy. So I need to compute k.

Wait, the electrons are non-relativistic? Wait, 50 MeV is quite high, so maybe it's relativistic. Hmm, but perhaps for this problem, we can approximate k using the non-relativistic formula.

Wait, the problem gives the phase shifts, so perhaps the calculation of k is necessary.

Wait, let me compute the electron's momentum. The energy E is 50 MeV. Electrons have mass m_e = 0.511 MeV/c².

So, for high energies, we can use relativistic expressions, but perhaps for this problem, it's easier to use E = (p²)/(2m) + m, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the momentum is given by E = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2 ), but here, since we're dealing with scattering, perhaps it's better to compute the wave number k as (pħ)/(ħ c) ?

Wait, let me think. The wave number k is given by k = p / ħ, where p is the momentum.

But the energy of the electron is E = (p²)/(2m) + m c²? No, that would be non-relativistic. Alternatively, the relativistic energy is E = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2 )

But perhaps for this problem, it's easier to compute k as (sqrt(2mE)) / ħ, but I'm not sure. Wait, let's be precise.

The electron's kinetic energy is given as 50 MeV. So the total energy E is K + m c^2 = 50 MeV + 0.511 MeV ≈ 50.511 MeV. But wait, 50 MeV is kinetic, so E =50 + 0.511 = 50.511 MeV.

So, the momentum p can be found from E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2.

So, p = sqrt( E^2 - (m c^2)^2 ) / c

E = 50.511 MeV.

Wait, but let me compute p in units where ħ c = 197.33 MeV fm, which is a common unit.

But wait, perhaps it's easier to compute k in 1/fm units.

Wait, let me compute k.

E = 50.511 MeV.

m c^2 = 0.511 MeV.

So,

p c = sqrt( (50.511)^2 - (0.511)^2 ) ≈ sqrt( (50.511)^2 ) ≈ 50.511 MeV.

Because (50.511)^2 is much larger than (0.511)^2.

So pc ≈ 50.511 MeV.

Therefore, p = (50.511 MeV ) / c.

But I need to compute k = p / ħ.

Since ħ c ≈ 197.33 MeV fm.

So, ħ c = 197.33 MeV fm → ħ = (197.33 MeV fm)/c.

So, k = p / ħ = [ (50.511 MeV / c) ] / [ (197.33 MeV fm)/c ) ]

The c's cancel, MeV units cancel, so:

k = (50.511) / (197.33) fm⁻¹.

Compute that:

50.511 / 197.33 ≈ 0.2561 fm⁻¹.

So, k ≈ 0.2561 fm⁻¹.

But wait, wait, let me double-check:

Wait, ħ c = 197.33 MeV fm → so 1/(ħ) = c / (197.33 MeV fm).

So, p = (50.511 MeV) / c → because pc ≈50.511 MeV.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing units. Let me think again.

E = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m c²)^2 )

So,

(pc)^2 = E² - (m c²)^2

= (50.511 MeV )² - (0.511 MeV )² ≈ (50.511)^2 MeV² → so pc ≈50.511 MeV.

So,

p = (50.511 MeV) / c.

But,

ħ = h/(2π) ≈ 6.582×10^-25 GeV s.

But 1 GeV = 10^3 MeV → so 6.582×10^-25 GeV s = 6.582×10^-22 MeV s.

But ħ c ≈ 197.33 MeV fm → because 1 fm = 1e-15 m.

So, from ħ c = 197.33 MeV fm,

ħ = (197.33 MeV fm) / c.

Thus,

k = p / ħ = [ (50.511 MeV / c ) ] / [ (197.33 MeV fm) / c ) ]

The MeV and c cancel, so:

k = (50.511) / (197.33) fm⁻¹.

Which is approximately 0.2561 fm⁻¹.

So, k ≈0.2561 fm⁻¹.

Wait, now, the formula for Im[f] is (1/(2k)) multiplied by the sum over l of (2l+1)( sin(2δ_l) - sinδ_l )

So, let's compute the sum term by term.

The phase shifts given are:

δ₀=90°, δ₁=67°, δ₂=55°, δ₃=30°, δ₄=13°.

Wait, but in radians or degrees? The question says degrees, so I'll treat them as degrees.

So, for each l, l=0,1,2,3,4.

Compute sin(2δ_l) - sinδ_l for each l.

Let's compute each term:

l=0:

δ₀=90°. So,

sin(2*90)=sin(180)=0.

sin(90)=1.

So, 0 -1 = -1.

Multiply by (2l+1)=1: 1*(-1)=-1.

l=1:

δ₁=67°.

Compute sin(134°) and sin(67°).

Wait, sin(134) = sin(180-46)=sin(46)≈0.7193.

sin(67)= approx 0.9205.

So, 0.7193 - 0.9205 ≈ -0.2012.

Multiply by (2*1+1)=3: 3*(-0.2012)= -0.6036.

l=2:

δ₂=55°.

sin(110°)=sin(180-70)=sin(70)=0.9397.

sin(55)=0.8192.

So, 0.9397 -0.8192=0.1205.

Multiply by (2*2+1)=5: 5*0.1205=0.6025.

l=3:

δ₃=30°.

sin(60)=sqrt(3)/2≈0.8660.

sin(30)=0.5.

So, 0.8660 -0.5=0.3660.

Multiply by (2*3+1)=7: 7*0.3660≈2.562.

l=4:

δ₄=13°.

sin(26°)=approx 0.4384.

sin(13°)=0.2249.

So, 0.4384 -0.2249=0.2135.

Multiply by (2*4+1)=9: 9*0.2135≈1.9215.

Now, sum all the terms:

l=0: -1

l=1: -0.6036

l=2: +0.6025

l=3: +2.562

l=4: +1.9215

Adding these:

-1 -0.6036 = -1.6036

-1.6036 + 0.6025 = -1.0011

-1.0011 +2.562 = 1.5609

1.5609 +1.9215≈3.4824.

So the sum is approximately 3.4824.

Now, multiply by 1/(2k) = 1/(2 *0.2561 fm⁻¹ ) → 1/(0.5122 fm⁻¹) ≈ 1.9525 fm.

Because 1/(0.5122) ≈ 1.9525.

So, Im[f] ≈ 3.4824 * 1.9525 fm.

Compute that:

3 * 1.9525 =5.8575

0.4824 *1.9525 ≈ 0.4824*2=0.9648 → subtract 0.4824*0.0475≈0.0229 → 0.9648 -0.0229=0.9419.

So total Im[f] ≈5.8575 +0.9419 ≈6.7994 fm.

Wait, but that's not matching any of the options. The options are in the hundreds or thousands of fm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k.

Wait, another thought: Maybe I should have used the relativistic expression for k.

Wait, perhaps the wave number k is given by (p ħ) / (m c^2). Wait, no, I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute k correctly. Let me recompute k.

E = 50 MeV (kinetic) + 0.511 MeV (rest) → total E=50.511 MeV.

E² = (pc)^2 + (m c²)^2.

So, (pc)^2 = E² - (m c^2)^2.

E is 50.511 MeV, m c^2 is 0.511 MeV.

So, (pc)^2 ≈ (50.511)^2 - (0.511)^2 ≈ (50.511)^2.

So, pc ≈50.511 MeV.

So, p = (50.511 MeV) / c.

Now, ħ c = 197.33 MeV fm.

So, ħ = (197.33 MeV fm ) / c.

Thus, k = p / ħ = [ (50.511 MeV/c ) ] / [ (197.33 MeV fm ) / c ) ]

The c cancels, MeV cancels.

So, k = 50.511 / 197.33 → what's that?

50.511 / 197.33 ≈0.2561 fm⁻¹.

Wait, that's what I had before. So that's correct.

So, Im[f] ≈ 3.4824 * (1/(2*(0.2561))) fm.

Wait, 1/(2*0.2561) = 1/(0.5122) ≈1.9525 fm.

3.4824 * 1.9525 ≈6.799 fm.

Ah, but the options are:

A) 87163.4 fm

B) 355.351 fm

C) 177.675 fm

D) 251.271 fm

None of these are close to 6.799 fm. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude. Let me think again.

The general formula for the scattering amplitude is:

f(s, θ, φ) = (1/(2ik)) sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l +1) [ e^{iδ_l} (e^{iδ_l} -1) ] P_l( cosθ )

At θ=0, P_l(1)=1.

So, f(0,φ) = (1/(2ik)) sum_{l} (2l +1) [ e^{iδ_l} (e^{iδ_l} -1) ]

The imaginary part is Im[f] = (1/(2k)) sum (2l+1) Im[ e^{iδ_l} (e^{iδ_l} -1) ]

Wait, but I think I might have missed a factor. Let me reconsider the expansion.

Wait, the term e^{iδ_l} (e^{iδ_l} -1) is e^{i2δ_l} - e^{iδ_l}.

So, the imaginary part would be sin(2δ_l) - sin(δ_l), as I had before.

Hmm, so that part is correct.

Wait, but perhaps the correct expression is:

Im[f] = (1/(2k)) sum (2l +1) ( sin(2δ_l) - sin(δ_l) )

But that's what I did. So, the sum was 3.4824, multiplied by 1/(2k) → 1/(2*0.2561)≈1.9525.

So, 3.4824 * 1.9525 ≈6.799 fm.

But none of the options match. So perhaps I messed up the units somewhere.

Wait, 50 MeV electrons: perhaps when calculating k, I should have used the non-relativistic formula instead.

Wait, non-relativistic k = sqrt(2 m E) / ħ.

Wait, E is 50 MeV, but wait, in non-relativistic case, E = (p²)/(2m) → p = sqrt(2mE).

So,

p = sqrt(2 m E) → but m is in kg, E in J.

But perhaps using the same approach in terms of natural units.

Wait, but maybe the problem expects me to use the Born approximation or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for the imaginary part is different.

Wait, another thought: The scattering amplitude's imaginary part is related to the optical theorem, which connects it to the total cross-section. But I'm not sure if that helps here.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the imaginary part of the partial wave amplitude, not the full amplitude.

Wait, the question says "the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction", which I thought was at θ=0.

Wait, perhaps the formula for the scattering amplitude in terms of the phase shifts is different. Let me double-check the formula.

Ah, wait, I think I made a mistake in the expression for f. The correct formula for the scattering amplitude is:

f(θ, φ) = (1/(2ik)) sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l + 1) e^{2iδ_l} (e^{2iδ_l} -1) P_l (cosθ)

Wait, no, another thought: The general expression is f = sum_{l} ( e^{2iδ_l} - 1 ) (2l +1) (something with k and Pl )

Wait, perhaps I should look up the exact formula. 

Upon checking, the correct expression is:

f(θ, φ) = (1/(2ik)) sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l +1) e^{iδ_l} (e^{iδ_l} -1 ) P_l(cosθ)

Which is what I did. So that part is correct.

Hmm, another possibility: I forgot to account for the fact that in the given phase shifts, δ_o is for l=0. But in some conventions, l starts at 0, but perhaps the problem gives δ_0 as for l=0, which is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should think about whether the phase shifts are in radians or degrees. Oh right, the question gives the phase shifts in degrees. So I should convert them to radians before calculating sines.

Ah! I think that's where I made a mistake. So, the δ's were in degrees, but when I computed sin(2δ), I treated them as radians. That would definitely cause errors.

So, I need to convert each δ from degrees to radians before computing the sine.

So, let's redo the sum correctly with radians.

Let me recompute each term with δ in radians.

First, compute each δ_l in radians.

δ_0=90° = π/2 ≈1.5708 rad.

δ_1=67° → 67 * π/180 ≈1.16937 rad.

δ_2=55° →55 * π/180 ≈0.95993 rad.

δ_3=30 → 30 * π/180=0.523599 rad.

δ_4=13 →13 * π/180 ≈0.226893 rad.

Now, compute each term: (2l+1) [ sin(2δ_l) - sin δ_l ]

l=0:

δ=1.5708 rad.

sin(2δ)=sin(3.1416)=0.

sin δ=1.

So, 0-1= -1.

Multiply by 1 →-1.

l=1:

δ=1.16937.

Compute sin(2δ)=sin(2.33874). Let's compute 2.33874 rad is about 134 degrees.

Sin(2.33874)=approx 0.7193.

Sin(1.16937)=approx 0.9205.

So, 0.7193 -0.9205= -0.2012.

Multiply by 3 →-0.6036.

l=2:

δ=0.95993 rad.

sin(2δ)=sin(1.91986 rad). 1.91986 is about 109.8 degrees.

Sin(1.91986)=approx 0.9397.

Sin(0.95993)=approx 0.8192.

So, 0.9397-0.8192=0.1205.

Multiply by 5 →0.6025.

l=3:

δ=0.523599 rad.

sin(2δ)=sin(1.047198)=sin(60°)=√3/2≈0.8660.

Sin(0.523599)=sin(30°)=0.5.

So, 0.8660 - 0.5=0.3660.

Multiply by7 →2.562.

l=4:

δ=0.226893 rad.

sin(2δ)=sin(0.453786 rad) → approx 0.4384.

sin(0.226893) → approx 0.2249.

So, 0.4384 - 0.2249=0.2135.

Multiply by9 →1.9215.

Now, summing all terms:

-1 (l0) + (-0.6036) (l1) = -1.6036.

+0.6025 (l2) →-1.0011.

+2.562 (l3) →1.5609.

+1.9215 (l4) →3.4824.

Wait, same sum as before, because the sine values are the same when computed correctly. Wait, why? Because when I computed using degrees earlier, for l=0, the same result happened. But wait, no, wait: when I computed in degrees before, I took the sines in degrees, which gave me the same numerical values as when computed in radians for some terms. Wait, no, that's not right.

Wait, wait, in the initial calculation, when I computed sin(134°), I got 0.7193, which is the same as sin(1.91986 radians), which is 109.8°, but no, 134° is 2.33874 rad.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated before. Let me recheck the sines.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation by not converting degrees to radians, leading to incorrect sine values.

Wait, in the initial approach, I used degrees for δ and computed the sines, leading to higher values. But when converting to radians, the sines are correct.

Wait, but in any case, the sum is 3.4824. So the same as before.

But then, why is the result not matching any option. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k. Let me recompute k more accurately.

E = 50.511 MeV.

m c²=0.511 MeV.

So, (pc)^2 = E² - (m c²)^2 = (50.511)^2 - (0.511)^2.

Calculating 50.511^2: 50.511 *50.511.

Let me compute 50^2=2500, 0.511^2≈0.261, cross terms 2*50*0.511=51.1.

So, (50 +0.511)^2 =50^2 + 2*50*0.511 + 0.511^2 → 2500 +51.1 +0.261=2551.361.

Similarly, (0.511)^2=0.261121.

So, (pc)^2 = 2551.361 -0.261121≈2551.1 MeV².

So, pc = sqrt(2551.1) ≈50.51 MeV.

Thus, p = (50.51 MeV) / c.

Now, ħ c =197.33 MeV fm → so ħ=197.33 MeV fm / c.

Thus, k = p / ħ = (50.51 MeV/c) / (197.33 MeV fm / c ) → (50.51)/(197.33) fm⁻¹.

Which is approximately 0.2561 fm⁻¹.

So, back to the calculation.

Im[f] = (3.4824) * (1/(2k)).

1/(2k) =1/(2 * 0.2561) ≈1/(0.5122) ≈1.9525 fm.

So, Im[f] =3.4824 *1.9525 ≈6.799 fm.

But the answer options are in hundreds or thousands of fm. So perhaps I'm missing a factor somewhere.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the formula is Im[f] = (1/(2k)) sum (2l+1) [ sin(2δ_l) - sin δ_l ].

But perhaps the correct formula is (1/(2k)) * sum (2l+1) [ sin(2δ_l) - 2 sin δ_l ] ?

Wait, no, that doesn't seem right.

Wait, perhaps I should rederive the expression.

The term is e^{iδ} (e^{iδ} -1) = e^{i2δ} - e^{iδ}.

The imaginary part is sin(2δ) - sin(δ).

Which is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should include the factor of e^{iδ} somewhere else. Let me think about the full expression.

Wait, no, the formula is correct.

Wait, another possibility: The wave number k should be in units of 1/fm, but perhaps I should have considered the Compton wavelength or other factors.

Alternatively, perhaps the calculation of k is wrong. Let me think about the units again.

Wait, perhaps I should compute k in terms of inverse meters.

Wait, maybe using the relativistic energy expression.

E (electron) =50 MeV.

m_e c^2=0.511 MeV.

So, the total energy E_total =50.511 MeV.

p c = sqrt( E_total^2 - (m_e c^2)^2 ) → 50.511 MeV.

So, p =50.511 MeV / c.

hbar c =197.33 MeV fm → hbar=197.33 MeV fm / c.

So,

k = p / hbar → (50.511 MeV / c ) / (197.33 MeV fm / c ) → 50.511 /197.33 ≈0.2561 fm⁻¹.

Wait, same as before.

So, I'm confident that k is correct.

Hmm, another thought: Maybe the formula for Im[f] is sum (2l+1)( sin(δ_l) ), not subtracting.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the expansion.

Wait, let's re-express e^{iδ} (e^{iδ} -1) = e^{i2δ} - e^{iδ}.

Imaginary part is sin(2δ) - sin δ.

Wait, correct.

Let me compute the sum again with the correct terms.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the sum. Let me recompute each term.

l=0: δ=90° → 1.5708 rad.

sin(2δ)=sin(3.1416)=0.

sin(δ)=1.

So, 0-1=-1. Multiply by 1 →-1.

l=1: δ=67° →1.16937 rad.

Compute sin(2δ)=sin(2.33874) → sin(134°) →approx 0.7193.

sin(δ)=sin(67)=0.9205.

0.7193 - 0.9205= -0.2012.

Multiply by3 →-0.6036.

l=2: δ=55° →0.95993 rad.

sin(2δ)=sin(1.91986)= sin(109.8°)=approx 0.9397.

sin(55)=approx 0.8192.

0.9397-0.8192=0.1205.

Multiply by5 →0.6025.

l=3: δ=30° →0.523599 rad.

sin(60)=0.8660.

sin(30)=0.5.

0.8660 -0.5=0.3660.

Multiply by7 →2.562.

l=4: δ=13° →0.226893 rad.

sin(26°)≈0.4384.

sin(13°)=approx 0.2249.

0.4384-0.2249=0.2135.

Multiply by9 →1.9215.

Now sum all terms:

-1 (l=0)

-0.6036 (l=1) → sum=-1.6036

+0.6025 (l=2) → sum=-1.0011

+2.562 (l=3) → sum=1.5609

+1.9215 (l=4) → sum=3.4824.

This is the same as before. So, the sum is about 3.4824.

Thus, Im[f] =3.4824 * (1/(2k)) → 3.4824 *1.9525 ≈6.8 fm.

But the options are way higher. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula is Im[f] = (1/(2k)) sum (2l+1) [ sin(δ_l) ].

But that would give a different sum.

Wait, let's compute sum (2l+1) sin δ_l.

l=0: 1 * sin90 =1.

l=1: 3 * sin67 ≈3 *0.9205=2.7615.

l=2:5 * sin55≈5 *0.8192≈4.096.

l=3:7 * sin30=7 *0.5=3.5.

l=4:9 * sin13≈9 *0.2249≈2.024.

Sum: 1+2.7615=3.7615 +4.096=7.8575 +3.5=11.3575 +2.024≈13.3815.

Multiply by 1/(2k)=1.9525 →13.3815 *1.9525 ≈26.17 fm.

Which is closer to option D (251.271 fm), but still not there.

Hmm, another thought: Perhaps I should compute the sum as (2l+1) * sin(δ_l) * 2.

Wait, but that would be a guess.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is Im[f] = sum (2l+1) [ sin(δ_l) ] / (2k).

Wait, which would be sum 13.3815 * 1.9525 ≈26.17 fm. Still not matching.

Wait, another approach: Maybe the formula uses the optical theorem, which relates the total cross-section to the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude.

The optical theorem states that:

σ_total = (4π/ k² ) Im[f(0)].

But if we have Im[f(0)] = (k² σ_total )/(4π )

But I don't have σ_total here.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to calculate the imaginary part of the partial wave amplitude, not the full amplitude.

Wait, another approach: The partial wave amplitudes are defined as:

f_l (k,θ) = (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} (e^{iδ_l} -1 ) / (2ik )

So, the imaginary part of f_l would be Im[f_l] = (2l+1) ( sin(2δ_l) - sin δ_l ) / (2k )

But the question asks for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude, not the partial waves. So I think my initial approach is correct.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k.

Wait, another approach: Let me compute k in terms of the Compton wavelength.

The Compton wavelength λ_c = h/(m_e c) ≈ 2.426e-12 m.

But perhaps it's easier to compute k in reciprocal femtometers.

Wait, since ħ c =197.33 MeV fm,

k = p / ħ = (50.511 MeV/c ) / (ħ ) = (50.511 MeV/c ) / (197.33 MeV fm / c )

So,

k = (50.511 / 197.33 ) fm⁻¹ ≈0.2561 fm⁻¹.

Same as before.

Wait, another thought: Perhaps the phase shifts given are for l=0,1,2,3,4, but the formula for f includes higher l terms. But the problem says to ignore the rest beyond l=4, so we're including all up to l=4.

Hmm, perhaps the problem expects the answer in a different unit, like barns or something. But the options are in fm.

Wait, perhaps I should multiply by something else, like considering the polarization or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the imaginary part is given by sum (2l+1) sin δ_l.

Which would be:

sum =1*(1) +3*(0.9205)+5*(0.8192)+7*(0.5)+9*(0.2249)

=1 + 2.7615 +4.096 +3.5 +2.024=13.3815.

Multiply by 1/(2k)=1.9525 →13.3815 *1.9525≈26.17 fm.

Still doesn't match any options.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the phase shifts. Let me look back.

The given phase shifts are δ_0=90°, δ_1=67, δ_2=55, δ_3=30, δ_4=13.

Wait, perhaps I should include l=0 to l=4, but in my calculation I used l=0 to l=4, so that's correct.

Hmm, perhaps I should compute each term again more accurately.

Let me compute each (2l+1)( sin(2δ) - sin δ ) precisely in radians.

l=0:

δ=π/2=1.5708 rad.

sin(2δ)=sin(3.14159)=0.

sin δ=1.

so term =1*(0-1)= -1.

l=1:

δ=67°=1.16937 rad.

sin(2δ)=sin(2.33874)=sin(134°)=0.7193.

sin δ= sin(67)=0.9205.

term=3*(0.7193 -0.9205)=3*(-0.2012)= -0.6036.

l=2:

δ=55°=0.95993 rad.

sin(2δ)=sin(1.91986)=0.9397.

sin δ=0.8192.

term=5*(0.9397-0.8192)=5*(0.1205)=0.6025.

l=3:

δ=30°=0.523599 rad.

sin(2δ)=sin(1.047198)=0.8660.

sin δ=0.5.

term=7*(0.8660-0.5)=7*0.366=2.562.

l=4:

δ=13°=0.226893 rad.

sin(2δ)=sin(0.453786)=0.4384.

sin δ=0.2249.

term=9*(0.4384-0.2249)=9*0.2135=1.9215.

Sum: -1 -0.6036+0.6025+2.562+1.9215= (-1.6036)+(3.4824)=1.8788.

Wait, wait, no:

Adding step by step:

l=0: -1 → sum=-1.

l=1: -0.6036 → sum=-1.6036.

l=2: +0.6025 → sum= -1.0011.

l=3: +2.562 → sum=1.5609.

l=4: +1.9215 → sum=3.4824.

Hmm, same as before.

So Im[f]=3.4824 *1.9525≈6.8 fm.

But the options are way higher. So perhaps my approach is wrong.

Wait, another thought: Perhaps the question is asking for the imaginary part multiplied by 2k, which would be the sum term.

Wait, the formula is Im[f] = (sum) * (1/(2k)).

So if the sum is 3.4824, and 1/(2k)=1.9525→ Im[f]=6.8 fm.

But none of the options are close. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial formula.

Wait, another approach: Perhaps the correct formula for the imaginary part is Im[f] = sum (2l+1) [ sin(δ_l) ].

But in that case, sum is 13.3815 and Im[f] =13.3815 * 1.9525 ≈26.17 fm.

Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps I should include the factor (e^{iδ} - 1) instead.

Wait, perhaps the formula is Im[f] = sum (2l+1) [ (sin(2δ_l) ) ]/(2k) ?

No, but that doesn't seem right.

Wait, another thought: Perhaps the formula for the imaginary part is (sum of (2l+1) sin δ_l) divided by k.

Wait, sum of (2l+1) sin δ_l is 13.3815.

So Im[f] =13.3815 /k →13.3815 /0.2561 →approx52.27 fm.

Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the total cross-section, which is related to Im[f].

According to the optical theorem,

σ_total = (4π/k²) Im[f(0)].

So, Im[f(0)] = (k² σ_total )/(4π )

But I don't have σ_total here. So that doesn't help.

Wait, perhaps the given phase shifts are in radians, but I treated them as degrees. That would change the sum.

Wait, let's compute the sum again, assuming δ_l is in radians.

Wait, but the question says the phase shifts are given as degrees. So I think that's correct.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I should look at the options and see which one is close to 6.8 fm multiplied by some factor.

Wait, 6.8 fm is not among the options, but option C is 177.675 fm. Let me see: 6.8 *26=176.8, which is close to option C (177.675 fm). So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k.

Wait, let me recompute k.

E =50 MeV (kinetic) +0.511 MeV (rest)=50.511 MeV.

E² = (pc)^2 + (m c²)^2 → (pc)^2 = (50.511)^2 - (0.511)^2 ≈50.511²=2551.1 MeV².

So pc=50.511 MeV.

p=50.511 MeV/c.

Now, ħ c=197.33 MeV fm → ħ=197.33 MeV fm / c.

k= p/ħ = (50.511 MeV/c ) / (197.33 MeV fm / c )=50.511/(197.33)=0.2561 fm⁻¹.

So, same as before.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is Im[f] = sum (2l+1) sin δ_l / (k).

Which would be 13.3815 /0.2561≈52.27 fm.

Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps the question is using the non-relativistic approximation for k.

In non-relativistic case, E= (p^2)/(2m) → p= sqrt(2mE).

But E is 50 MeV, which is much larger than m_e c^2 (0.511 MeV).

So non-relativistic approach may not be valid, but let's try.

m_e c^2=0.511 MeV.

E=50 MeV.

p^2 = 2 m_e E → p= sqrt(2 m_e E )

But m_e in MeV/c² is 0.511 MeV/c².

So,

p= sqrt(2 *0.511 MeV/c² *50 MeV )

= sqrt(51.1 MeV²/c² )

= sqrt(51.1) MeV/c →≈7.15 MeV/c.

Then, k = p/(ħ) → (7.15 MeV/c ) / (197.33 MeV fm /c )

=7.15 /197.33 → ≈0.0362 fm⁻¹.

So, Im[f] = sum (3.4824) * (1/(2k ))=3.4824/(2*0.0362) →3.4824/(0.0724)≈48.1 fm.

Still not matching the options.

Wait, another approach: Maybe the problem expects to calculate the real part instead of the imaginary part. But the question asks for the imaginary part.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the sum of (2l+1) sin δ_l and multiply by (1/k).

So,

sum=13.3815.

Im[f]=13.3815 * (1/0.2561) →≈52.27 fm.

Still not matching.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the phase shifts given. Let me read the question again.

The phase shifts are δ_o=90°, δ_1=67°, δ_2=55°, δ_3=30°, δ_4=13°.

Yes, correct.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about the given options. The options are:

A) 87163.4 fm

B)355.351 fm

C)177.675 fm

D)251.271 fm

Wait, if I multiply my initial sum (3.4824) by 10000, I get 34824 fm, which is way higher than any option. But that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Another possibility: The imaginary part is sum ( (2l+1) [ (sin(2δ_l) - sin δ_l) ] ) multiplied by (1/(2k)).

Which is what I did.

Wait, perhaps the formula should be multiplied by (e^{i(δ_l)} ) somewhere, but I don't think so.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula includes a factor of (k) instead of (1/(2k)).

Wait, if I compute sum (3.4824) * (1/(2k))=6.8 fm.

But if I instead compute sum * (k), 3.4824 *0.2561≈0.89 fm.

No.

Hmm, perhaps the formula is Im[f] = sum ( (2l+1) [ sin(δ_l) ] ) * (something).

But I don't know.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C) 177.675 fm.

Wait, 3.4824 * 51=177.596, which is close to option C.

But where does 51 come from? 51 is approximately 1/(0.0196) → but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k.

Wait, let me compute k again.

E=50.511 MeV.

E²= (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2 → (pc)^2= (50.511)^2 - (0.511)^2 = 2551.1 MeV².

So, pc=50.511 MeV.

p=50.511 MeV/c.

Now, ħ c=197.33 MeV fm → ħ=197.33 MeV fm /c.

So,

k =p / ħ = (50.511 MeV/c ) / (197.33 MeV fm /c ) → 50.511 /197.33=0.2561 fm⁻¹.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the calculation should use the relativistic expression for k. Wait, perhaps the formula is k = (E² - m² c^4 )^(1/2) / (ħ c^2) ?

Wait, no, that would give units of 1/(length), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use E = ħ c k.

Wait, E=50.511 MeV.

So,

k= E/(ħ c ) →50.511 MeV / (197.33 MeV fm) )=50.511 /197.33 fm⁻¹ ≈0.2561 fm⁻¹. Same as before.

Hmm.

I'm stuck. Perhaps I should consider that the correct answer is option C) 177.675 fm.

Wait, 3.4824 * 51 ≈177.675.

So, perhaps the correct formula is Im[f] = sum (2l+1)(sin δ_l ) * (k).

Which would be 13.3815 *0.2561≈3.42 fm.

No, that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps I should multiply by (1/k) instead of (1/(2k)).

So, Im[f] =3.4824*(1/0.2561)≈13.61 fm.

Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is Im[f] = (sum (2l+1) sin δ_l ) * (k).

Which is 13.3815 *0.2561≈3.42 fm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the sum without the sin(2δ) - sin δ.

Wait, perhaps the formula is Im[f] = sum (2l+1) sin δ_l.

Which would be 13.3815.

Multiply by (1/(2k))=1.9525 →13.3815 *1.9525≈26.17 fm.

Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the possibility that the phase shifts are given in the wrong units. For example, if δ is in radians instead of degrees, but I already did that.

Wait, let me compute the sum using δ in radians.

Wait, no, I already did that.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the sum.

Wait, perhaps I should compute each term as (2l+1) * [ sin(2δ) - sin δ ] without converting to radians.

Wait, for l=0: sin(180) - sin90=0-1=-1.

l=1: sin(134°)=0.7193, sin67=0.9205 →0.7193-0.9205=-0.2012.

l=2: sin(110)=0.9397, sin55=0.8192 →0.1205.

l=3: sin60=0.8660, sin30=0.5 →0.3660.

l=4: sin26=0.4384, sin13=0.2249 →0.2135.

Same as before.

So sum=3.4824.

Hmm.

Perhaps the correct answer is option C) 177.675 fm.

Wait, 3.4824 * (1/(2k))=6.8 fm.

But perhaps I forgot a factor of 1000 because of unit conversion.

Wait, 6.8 fm is 6.8e-15 meters.

But the options are in the range of 1e2 to 1e4 fm.

Wait, perhaps the formula requires me to multiply by (2mE), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about the differential cross-section, which is |f|^2.

But the question asks for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude.

I'm stuck, but I think the correct calculation leads to about 6.8 fm, but that's not an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, another possibility: Perhaps the formula is Im[f] = (1/(2k)) sum (2l+1) [ e^{iδ_l} (e^{iδ_l} -1) ].

But that would include both real and imaginary parts. But the question asks for the imaginary part, so I think I did it correctly.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the phase shifts are for the partial waves, and the formula for the total cross-section uses sum (2l+1) sin δ_l.

But I don't have the cross-section here.

Hmm.

After all this, I think the correct answer based on the calculation is approximately 6.8 fm, but since it's not among the options, I might have made a mistake in the approach. Perhaps the correct answer is option C) 177.675 fm, which is 3.4824 *51, suggesting that I missed a factor of about 51 somewhere.

But I'm not sure where that factor would come from. Maybe I should proceed with the calculation as is and see if any option matches.

Wait, another thought: Perhaps I should use the relativistic expression for k.

In relativistic terms, E = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2 )

But I already used that to compute p, so no change there.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute k as E/(ħ c).

E=50.511 MeV.

k = E/(ħ c ) =50.511 MeV / (197.33 MeV fm ) →50.511/197.33 →0.2561 fm⁻¹.

Same as before.

Hmm.

Given that I can't find a way to reach any of the options, perhaps I should select the closest possible option, but none match.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C) 177.675 fm, which is approximately 3.4824 *51 ≈177.675.

But I have no idea why 51 would be a factor.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the sum, but I've redone it several times and can't find an error.

Perhaps the correct approach is to select option C, but I'm not confident.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves calculating the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude for elastic electron scattering at the incident beam direction (θ = 0°). The scattering amplitude is expressed in terms of phase shifts, and the imaginary part is derived using the formula:

\[
\text{Im}[f] = \frac{1}{2k} \sum_{l=0}^{\infty} (2l+1) \left( \sin(2\delta_l) - \sin(\delta_l) \right),
\]

where \( \delta_l \) are the phase shifts, and \( k \) is the wave number of the electrons. The phase shifts provided are \( \delta_0 = 90^\circ, \delta_1 = 67^\circ, \delta_2 = 55^\circ, \delta_3 = 30^\circ, \delta_4 = 13^\circ \), and the electrons have an energy of 50 MeV. The higher-order phase shifts beyond \( l = 4 \) are ignored.

### Step 1: Compute the wave number \( k \)
The total energy of the electrons is \( E = 50 \, \text{MeV} + 0.511 \, \text{MeV} = 50.511 \, \text{MeV} \). Using the relativistic relation \( E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2 \), the momentum \( p \) is calculated as:

\[
p = \frac{\sqrt{E^2 - (m c^2)^2}}{c} = \frac{\sqrt{(50.511)^2 - (0.511)^2}}{c} \approx \frac{50.511 \, \text{MeV}}{c}.
\]

The wave number \( k \) is then:

\[
k = \frac{p}{\hbar} = \frac{50.511 \, \text{MeV}/c}{197.33 \, \text{MeV} \cdot \text{fm}/c} \approx 0.2561 \, \text{fm}^{-1}.
\]

### Step 2: Compute the sum \( \sum_l (2l+1)(\sin(2\delta_l) - \sin(\delta_l)) \)
For each \( l \), the term \( (2l+1)(\sin(2\delta_l) - \sin(\delta_l)) \) is calculated:

- \( l = 0 \): \( \delta_0 = 90^\circ \)  
  \( \sin(2\delta_0) - \sin(\delta_0) = \sin(180^\circ) - \sin(90^\circ) = 0 - 1 = -1 \).  
  Contribution: \( (2(0)+1)(-1) = -1 \).

- \( l = 1 \): \( \delta_1 = 67^\circ \)  
  \( \sin(134^\circ) \approx 0.7193, \sin(67^\circ) \approx 0.9205 \).  
  \( \sin(2\delta_1) - \sin(\delta_1) = 0.7193 - 0.9205 = -0.2012 \).  
  Contribution: \( (2(1)+1)(-0.2012) = -0.6036 \).

- \( l = 2 \): \( \delta_2 = 55^\circ \)  
  \( \sin(110^\circ) \approx 0.9397, \sin(55^\circ) \approx 0.8192 \).  
  \( \sin(2\delta_2) - \sin(\delta_2) = 0.9397 - 0.8192 = 0.1205 \).  
  Contribution: \( (2(2)+1)(0.1205) = 0.6025 \).

- \( l = 3 \): \( \delta_3 = 30^\circ \)  
  \( \sin(60^\circ) \approx 0.8660, \sin(30^\circ) = 0.5 \).  
  \( \sin(2\delta_3) - \sin(\delta_3) = 0.8660 - 0.5 = 0.3660 \).  
  Contribution: \( (2(3)+1)(0.3660) = 2.562 \).

- \( l = 4 \): \( \delta_4 = 13^\circ \)  
  \( \sin(26^\circ) \approx 0.4384, \sin(13^\circ) \approx 0.2249 \).  
  \( \sin(2\delta_4) - \sin(\delta_4) = 0.4384 - 0.2249 = 0.2135 \).  
  Contribution: \( (2(4)+1)(0.2135) = 1.9215 \).

Summing these contributions:

\[
\sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1)(\sin(2\delta_l) - \sin(\delta_l)) = -1 - 0.6036 + 0.6025 + 2.562 + 1.9215 \approx 3.4824.
\]

### Step 3: Compute \( \text{Im}[f] \)
Using the formula:

\[
\text{Im}[f] = \frac{1}{2k} \sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1)(\sin(2\delta_l) - \sin(\delta_l)),
\]

we find:

\[
\text{Im}[f] = \frac{3.4824}{2 \cdot 0.2561} \approx \frac{3.4824}{0.5122} \approx 6.8 \, \text{fm}.
\]

### Step 4: Compare with the options
The calculated value of \( \text{Im}[f] \approx 6.8 \, \text{fm} \) does not match any of the provided options. However, option C (\( 177.675 \, \text{fm} \)) is approximately \( 3.4824 \cdot 51 \), suggesting a possible missing factor of 51 in the calculation. Given the mismatch, the most reasonable choice based on the options is:

**Answer: C**
