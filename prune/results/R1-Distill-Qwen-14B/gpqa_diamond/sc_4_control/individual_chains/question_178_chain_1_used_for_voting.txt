Okay, so I've got this question about the Lagrangian in quantum field theory, and I need to find out the mass dimension of κ and determine if the theory is renormalizable. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that the mass dimension of a term in the Lagrangian is important because it affects renormalizability. The general rule is that each term in the Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4 since the action is dimensionless in natural units (where ħ = c = 1). So each term in the Lagrangian density should have dimension 4.

The given Lagrangian is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. I need to find the dimension of κ.

Let me break down each part:

1. ψ is a spinor field. I recall that in four dimensions, the spinor field has a mass dimension of 3/2. Because in the Dirac Lagrangian, L = i ψ̄ γ^μ ∂_μ ψ - m ψ̄ ψ, the mass term has m ψ̄ ψ. Since m has dimension 1, ψ must have dimension 3/2 because ψ̄ ψ is (3/2 + 3/2) = 3, and when multiplied by m (which is 1), it gives dimension 4 for the term. So ψ is [ψ] = 3/2.

2. σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]. Since γ matrices are dimensionless (they're just matrices), the commutator [γ_μ, γ_ν] is also dimensionless. So σ_{μν} is dimensionless because it's (i/2) times a dimensionless quantity.

3. F^{μν} is the field strength tensor for the electromagnetic field (assuming this is QED-like). The field strength F_{μν} has a mass dimension of 2. Because F_{μν} is ∂_μ A_ν - ∂_ν A_μ, and A is a vector potential with dimension 1 (since the covariant derivative is ∂ + i e A, and ∂ has dimension 1, so A must have dimension 1). So each derivative ∂_μ has dimension 1, and F is [∂][A] = 1+1=2.

Putting it all together, the term is κ multiplied by ψ̄ σ ψ F. So the dimensions of each component:

- ψ̄: same as ψ, which is 3/2.
- σ: dimensionless.
- ψ: 3/2.
- F: 2.

Multiply these together: (3/2) + (3/2) + 2 = (3) + 2 = 5. And then we have κ, so the entire term [L_int] is [κ]*5. But since the Lagrangian must have dimension 4, [L_int] =4.

So 4 = [κ] * 5 → [κ] = 4 /5. Wait, that can't be right because the options don't have 4/5. Did I make a mistake here?

Wait, wait. Let me double-check. The term is κ times ψ̄ σ ψ F, so each ψ is 3/2, σ is 0, F is 2. So the product is (3/2) + (3/2) + 0 + 2 = 3 +2 =5. So [κ] *5 must be 4, so [κ]=4/5. But the options given have [κ]=-1, 1, etc. Hmm, that's a problem because 4/5 is not an option.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the dimension counting somewhere. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: the interaction term in the Lagrangian should have dimension 4. So the product of the fields and coupling must be 4.

Another way: Each field term's dimension is added together. So, the term is κ ψ̄ σ ψ F.

So, let's see:

Each ψ is 3/2, and σ is dimensionless. F is 2.

So, the product of ψ̄ σ ψ F is (3/2) + (3/2) + (0) + (2) = 3 + 2 =5. So the term is κ * [something with dimension 5], and the Lagrangian must be dim 4. So 5 + [κ] =4 → [κ] = -1.

Ah! Because the Lagrangian has dimension 4, so the whole term (κ * product) must have dimension 4. So the product of the fields has dimension 5, so κ must have dimension 4 -5 = -1.

Wait, that makes sense. So [κ] = -1.

So the first part of the question, the mass dimension of κ is -1. So the options are A or C.

Now, the second part: is the theory renormalizable?

Renormalizability depends on the mass dimension of the coupling constant. If the coupling constant has dimension ≤ 0 (like 0 or negative), the theory is renormalizable. Because in four dimensions, terms with couplings of dimension d ≤0 are renormalizable. Wait, correct, because in 4D, for a term to be renormalizable, the dimension must be d ≤4. Wait, no, that refers to the terms in the Lagrangian.

Wait, no. The dimension of the coupling tells us about renormalizability. The coupling constant's dimension is [g] =4 - (sum of fields' dimensions). If [g] ≥0, then the theory is non-renormalizable. Because higher than 4 dimensions (in 4D spacetime) would require higher-dimensional operators.

Wait, no, the rule is that in 4D, for a term to be renormalizable, the coupling's dimension must satisfy [g] ≥ 0? Or is it the other way around? Wait, let me think.

Wait, the renormalizability condition is based on the superficial degree of divergence. For a term in the Lagrangian of the form g φ^n, the dimension is [g] =4 -n * [φ]. If [g] ≥0, the term is non-renormalizable because that would require higher loop corrections, leading to divergences that can't be canceled without introducing higher-order terms.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of Feynman diagrams. The superficial degree of divergence D is given by D =4 - (L × [coupling dimension term]).

Wait, perhaps a better way: The interaction term is L = g φ^n. The dimension of g is [g] = [Mass]^{d}.

The theory is renormalizable if all couplings have positive mass dimension (d) ≥0. Wait no, I think the other way around: if the coupling has positive mass dimension (d>0), the interaction is relevant (super-renormalizable?), but if d=0, it's marginal (renormalizable), and if d<0, it's irrelevant (non-renormalizable).

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me recall: In 4 dimensions, a coupling g for a term g φ^m has dimension [g] =4 - m × [φ]. For the term to be renormalizable, [g] must be ≥0. Because the term will be renormalizable if the coupling doesn't require higher and higher corrections, which is when the coupling is marginal or relevant.

Wait, another approach: The renormalizability is determined by the dimension of the coupling. For a coupling to appear in the renormalization group equation, it should have a dimension that doesn't lead to higher order terms.

Wait, I think I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the specific case.

In our case, κ has dimension -1. So [κ] = -1. In four dimensions, what's the rule?

In 4D, the dimension of a coupling in a term like g φ^k would be [g] =4 - (k) * [φ]. For the coupling to have a dimension of [g] >=0, the term is renormalizable.

Wait, but in our problem, the interaction term is of the form κ (ψ̄ σ ψ) F. The dimension of the field combination ψ̄ σ ψ F is 5, as we found earlier. So the Lagrangian term is κ times that. So the dimension of κ is 4 -5 = -1.

Now, for a theory to be renormalizable, the coupling constants must have positive or zero mass dimension. Because negative dimension implies that the interaction is non-renormalizable.

Wait, wait. Let me think about the general rule. In four dimensions, a term in the Lagrangian has the form (1/ n!) g φ^n. For the term to be renormalizable, the mass dimension of g must be ≥0. Because each field φ has a mass dimension. So for example, in φ^4 theory, each φ has dimension 1. So [g] =4 -4*1 =0. So it's renormalizable.

In our case, the term is κ ψ̄ σ ψ F. Let's see: ψ has dimension 3/2. So the product ψ̄ σ ψ is (3/2 +3/2) =3. Then F has dimension 2. So the product is 3 + 2 =5. The Lagrangian term is [κ] *5. So [κ] =4 -5= -1.

So [κ] = -1. Since this is negative, the interaction term is non-renormalizable. Because in 4D, couplings with negative dimension imply non-renormalizable interactions. So the theory is not renormalizable.

Wait, but wait. The interaction term is a dimension 5 operator. Because the Lagrangian term must have dimension 4. So our coupling κ is dimension -1, but the operator itself has dimension 5.

In general, higher-dimensional operators (like dimension 5) are non-renormalizable. So this theory is non-renormalizable.

So putting it together: [κ] is -1, and the theory is not renormalizable.

Looking at the options:

Option C says [κ]=-1, theory not renormalizable. Option A says [k]=-1 and renormalizable. So the correct option is C.

To determine the mass dimension of $\kappa$ and whether the theory is renormalizable, we analyze the given Lagrangian:

\[
\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}} = \kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu},
\]
where $\sigma_{\mu\nu} = \frac{i}{2}[\gamma_\mu, \gamma_\nu]$ and $F^{\mu\nu}$ is the field strength tensor.

### Step 1: Mass dimension of $\kappa$
1. The spinor field $\psi$ has a mass dimension of $[\psi] = \frac{3}{2}$ in four spacetime dimensions.
2. The commutator $\sigma_{\mu\nu}$ is dimensionless because it involves only the dimensionless $\gamma$ matrices.
3. The field strength tensor $F^{\mu\nu}$ has a mass dimension of $[F^{\mu\nu}] = 2$.
4. The term $\bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu}$ has a total mass dimension of:
   \[
   [\bar{\psi}] + [\psi] + [\sigma_{\mu\nu}] + [F^{\mu\nu}] = \frac{3}{2} + \frac{3}{2} + 0 + 2 = 5.
   \]
5. Since the Lagrangian density must have a mass dimension of $4$ in four dimensions, the mass dimension of $\kappa$ is:
   \[
   [\kappa] = 4 - 5 = -1.
   \]

### Step 2: Renormalizability of the theory
The renormalizability of a theory depends on the mass dimension of the coupling constant. In four dimensions, a theory is renormalizable if the coupling constant has a non-negative mass dimension ($[\kappa] \geq 0$). If the coupling constant has a negative mass dimension, the theory is non-renormalizable because it requires an infinite number of counterterms to handle divergences.

In this case, $[\kappa] = -1$, which is negative. Therefore, the theory is **not renormalizable**.

### Final Answer
The mass dimension of $\kappa$ is $[\kappa]_M = -1$, and the theory is not renormalizable.
