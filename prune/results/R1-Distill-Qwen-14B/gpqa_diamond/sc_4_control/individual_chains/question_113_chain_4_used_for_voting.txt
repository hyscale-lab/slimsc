Okay, so I have this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm going to try to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The question is about identifying an unknown compound based on its spectroscopic data. The techniques used are FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The options are four different chemical formulas: C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, and C6H12O.

Let's break down each piece of data provided and see what they can tell us about the compound.

First, the FTIR spectrum. It shows a very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm⁻¹. Broad peaks in FTIR around that region usually indicate O-H groups. A broad peak is typical for alcohols (where the O-H is in a -OH group) or maybe carboxylic acids (which have a very strong and broad O-H stretch). But wait, there's also another peak at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. The 1700 region is indicative of carbonyl groups, like ketones, aldehydes, esters, or maybe amides. The 1650 peak might suggest another carbonyl group or perhaps an aromatic ring (like conjugated carbonyls, maybe in a ring structure).

Hmm, but wait, 1700 is more typical of esters or ketones, maybe. The 1650 could be a conjugated carbonyl, like in an aromatic ester or maybe a conjugated ketone. Alternatively, it could be due to an aromatic ring with substituents, but that's usually around 1500-1600 for C=C stretching. Wait, maybe I should think about other possibilities. Oh, another thought: an absorption around 1650 could also be an aromatic ring if it's substituted, because the ring's vibrations can change. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, it might be due to an amide or another functional group.

Next, looking at the 1H NMR spectrum: there are several peaks, including some that correspond to vinyl-hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are those attached to a double bond, like in alkenes. So that suggests the compound has a double bond, possibly in a conjugated system, maybe part of an aromatic ring or an isolated double bond.

The Mass Spectrometry data shows a fragment peak at m/z =45. So what fragments could correspond to m/z 45? Let me think about possible fragments. Common fragments include CH3CO+ (43, but that's 43), but wait, 45 is higher. Maybe CH2O is 30, but that's lower. Another possibility is a fragment like (CH3)2CO, but that would be 58. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe a ketone group breaks off. Wait, another thought: the molecular ion or fragment at m/z 45 could be from a methyl group attached to an oxygen, like OCH3 (but that would be 31). Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is a methyl ester or something else. Wait, another approach: if the molecular formula is C6H10O2, for example, the molecular weight would be (6×12)+(10×1)+(2×16)=72+10+32=114. So a fragment at m/z 45 would be part of that.

Let me think about the possible functional groups. The FTIR has O-H (broad peak) and carbonyl groups (1700 and 1650). So the compound likely has both a carbonyl and an O-H group. That makes me think of esters. Because esters have a carbonyl (around 1700-1750 cm⁻¹) and an O-H (in the ester's -O- group? Wait, no, esters don't have an O-H group; wait, wait. Wait, esters are R-O-CO-O-R, but they don't have an -OH group, so maybe that's not it. Wait, then what gives the O-H peak?

Ah, wait! If the FTIR shows a broad peak around 3000, that could be an alcohol (R-OH), or perhaps a carboxylic acid (O-H). But the presence of a carbonyl at 1700 could be an ester, ketone, or aldehyde. But if the compound has both an O-H and a carbonyl, perhaps it's a carboxylic acid, but then the carbonyl would be around 1700 (for a carboxylic acid, the carbonyl is around 1700-1750 cm⁻¹), but also, the O-H would be very broad and around 2500-3300. So maybe that's a possibility. But wait, earlier I thought about esters, but that wouldn't have an O-H. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps it's a ketone with an alcohol group, but that's less common.

Alternatively, maybe it's an ester and an alcohol, but that might be two functional groups. Alternatively, maybe it's a hemiacetal or something else, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: let's think about the possible molecular formulas. The options are:

A) C6H12O2: degrees of unsaturation. For a formula CnHmOx, the degrees of unsaturation (DoU) is (2n +2 - m - x)/2. So for C6H12O2: n=6, m=12, x=2. So DoU = (2*6 +2 -12 -2)/2 = (14 -14)/2 = 0. So zero degrees of unsaturation: which would imply all single bonds, but wait, that can't be right because we have a carbonyl group and possibly a double bond.

Wait, maybe I should recalculate. Let me compute DoU for each option.

Option A: C6H12O2. DoU = (2*6 +2 - 12 -2)/2 = (14 -14)/2= 0. So zero DoU? That would mean all single bonds, but that can't be right because we have a carbonyl group (double bond) and perhaps a double bond elsewhere, so this may not fit. Wait, but maybe the structure is a cyclic ether with an ester group. Hmm, but I'm not sure yet.

Option B: C6H10O. DoU = (2*6 +2 -10 -1)/2 = (14 -11)/2=3/2=1.5. Wait, that can't be, DoU should be an integer. So perhaps I made a mistake. Let's recalculate.

Wait, the formula is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2, where X is halogens, N is nitrogens. Since there are no X or N, it's (2C +2 - H - O)/2. So for C6H10O: DoU = (2*6 +2 -10 -0)/2 = (14 -10)/2=4/2=2. So 2 degrees of unsaturation. That could mean one ring and one double bond, or two double bonds, or two rings.

Option C: C6H10O2. DoU = (2*6 +2 -10 -2)/2 = (14 -12)/2=2/2=1. So one degree of unsaturation. So maybe one ring or one double bond.

Option D: C6H12O. DoU = (2*6 +2 -12 -1)/2= (14-13)/2=1/2, which is 0.5. That can't be right, so perhaps I did that wrong. Wait, let me recalculate.

Wait, for C6H12O: (2*6 +2) is 14. 14 -12 (H) -1 (O)=1. So 1/2=0.5. Hmm, that's impossible, so perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Wait, maybe the correct formula for DoU is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So for C6H12O: 2*6=12, +2=14, minus H=12, minus O (as X? No, O is not X. X is halogen. So O is treated differently. So the formula would be (12+2 -12 -0 +0)/2= (14-12)/2=2/2=1. So DoU is 1. So one degree: could be a ring and a double bond, but that's more than one. Wait, no. One double bond or one ring. So perhaps a cyclic ether with a double bond.

Wait, but earlier I thought that maybe the compound has a carbonyl group (a double bond) and possibly an O-H group, which would imply another double bond. So perhaps the DoU needs to account for that.

Wait, maybe the answer is C6H10O2. Let's think about that.

Wait, let's go back to the Mass Spec data. The fragment at m/z 45. So what possible ions would have a mass of 45? Let me think about common fragments. For example, (CH3)2CO is acetone, which has a molecular weight of 58. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe a fragment like CH2COO- would be 60? Not sure.

Wait, another approach: 45 is also the molecular weight of (CH3)COH (which is 46, wait, no: C=12, H=1, O=16. So (CH3)COH would be 12*2 + 1*(3+2) + 16= 24 +5 +16=45. Oh yes! Wait, that's 45. So maybe the fragment is (CH3)COH+, but that's not a common fragment. Alternatively, maybe it's the (CH3)CO group, which would be 43 (12*2 +3*1 +16= 24+3+16=43). Hmm, but the peak is at 45.

Wait, another thought: the molecular formula of the unknown compound has to include the fragment. If the fragment is 45, and the molecular formula is, say, C6H10O2, which has a molecular weight of 114, then 114 minus 45 is 69. Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the compound has an ester group, which would break into a fragment of 45.

Wait, let's think about the possible structures. If the compound has an ester group, then the ester would break into the acid and alcohol parts. For instance, if it's methyl something, the fragment could be the methyl part. But methyl group is 15 (12+3+16?), no, wait, methyl ester is O-CO-OCH3. But the molecular ion for methyl group is 31. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: the fragment at 45 could be a ketone, like (CH3)2CO, which is 58. No, that's higher than 45. Maybe a CH2-O- group? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the fragment is a methylene group attached to an oxygen, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps I should think about what the NMR is telling me. The presence of vinyl hydrogens suggests there's a double bond, perhaps in an aromatic ring or an isolated double bond. So maybe the compound is an aromatic ester or something with an aromatic ring and an ester group, but I'm not sure.

Putting this together: the FTIR shows O-H (broad peak), and two carbonyls. Wait, two carbonyl peaks? But the IR shows peaks at 1700 and 1650, which might suggest two different carbonyl groups. Alternatively, perhaps it's a conjugated system where the carbonyl is part of an aromatic ring. For example, an aromatic ring with substituents that have carbonyl groups. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: maybe the IR peaks are not from two different carbonyls. Maybe the 1650 peak is from an aromatic ring's C=C stretching. So in that case, the 1700 peak would be the carbonyl, like an ester or ketone, and the 1650 would be the aromatic ring.

But then the O-H peak is from an alcohol or a carboxylic acid.

Wait, the presence of both a carbonyl and an O-H group suggests possible ester and alcohol, but that would require two oxygen-containing groups. Let's look at the options again.

Option A: C6H12O2. O2. So two oxygen atoms. So possible functional groups could be, say, an ester (O from the ester) and an alcohol (O from -OH). So that would fit with the O-H and carbonyl peaks.

Option C: C6H10O2. Two O's. Possible functional groups: ester and something else, but if the NMR shows vinyl protons, maybe a double bond.

Wait, looking at the molecular formulas again, which one fits the data?

If the compound has both an O-H and a carbonyl group, then it might be an ester with an alcohol, but that would require at least two oxygen atoms (one for the ester and one for the -OH). So that would fit options A and C, which have two O's.

So, let's consider each option.

Option A: C6H12O2. Degrees of unsaturation: (2*6 +2 -12 -2)/2= (14-14)/2=0. So zero DoU? That's impossible because of the carbonyl (a double bond) and the O-H. So that's a problem. So maybe this is not the correct option.

Option C: C6H10O2. DoU is (2*6 +2 -10 -2)/2= (14-12)/2=1. So one DoU. That could be one double bond or one ring.

But wait, the NMR has vinyl hydrogens, which implies a double bond. So the DoU should at least account for that.

So if the formula is C6H10O2, DoU is 1. So that's either a ring or a double bond. So if the compound has a double bond (from vinyl H) and an ester group, that would require another DoU. Wait, that can't be. Because with DoU=1, it can only have either a ring or a double bond, not both.

Hmm, this is getting confusing. Let me think again.

Wait, the DoU is calculated by considering all the atoms. So for C6H10O2, the calculation is:

DoU = (2*6 + 2 - 10 - 2 *1)/2 = (14 -12)/2= 1. So one DoU. So the structure must have either one ring or one double bond, or a ring plus a double bond that's somehow accounted for in the formula.

Wait, no, each DoU accounts for one double bond or one ring. So one DoU can only account for either one ring or one double bond.

So if the compound has a double bond (from vinyl H), then the DoU must be at least 1. So in C6H10O2, the DoU is 1, which would account for that double bond. But what about the carbonyl group (another double bond)? That would require another DoU, but we don't have it. So maybe this is inconsistent.

Wait, unless the carbonyl is part of a ring. For example, a cyclic ester, like a lactone. Let me think. A lactone has a cyclic ester structure, which would incorporate the carbonyl and an oxygen. But then, if the structure is a six-membered ring with an ester group, the DoU would be one, from the ring. But the carbonyl is part of the ring, so it doesn't add another DoU because the ring already accounts for that. Hmm, but I'm not sure about that. Wait, no, the ring is a DoU, and the carbonyl (double bond) would be another. So that would require two DoU. But in C6H10O2, the DoU is 1. So that might not fit.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the carbonyl is part of a conjugated system, so that the double bonds are conjugated, but I'm not sure how that affects the DoU.

Wait, another approach. Let's think about the mass spectrum. The fragment at m/z 45. Let's calculate what that could be. 45 is 45 g/mol.

Possible fragments:

- CH3COOH: molecular weight is 60. So no.

Wait, maybe CH3COO- (the acetate ion) is 58. No.

Wait, perhaps it's a smaller fragment. For example, (CH3)2CO is 58. Hmm, not 45.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the fragment is a ketene (O=C=O?), but that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, maybe it's an ethyl group attached to something else. Wait, ethyl (C2H5) is 29. Not 45.

Wait, another thought: 45 is the molecular weight of (CH3)COH, which would be 12*2 + 3 + 16 +1 = 24 +3 +16 +1=44. Hmm, close but not exactly. Maybe I'm not getting the right fragment.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a fragment from an ester. For example, the ester group could break into two parts. Suppose the ester is something like R-O-CO-R'. The fragment could be the R-O-CO- part, but I'm not sure about the mass.

Wait, maybe the compound is an ester with a methyl group. The methyl group would have a mass of 15 (12 + 3*1). So if the fragment is a methyl ester, perhaps it's (CH3O)CO. But that would be 15 (CH3O) + 28 (COOH without the H?) Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is from a benzene ring. If the compound is an aromatic ester, perhaps the benzene ring breaks off as a fragment. But benzene is 78, which is higher than 45.

Wait, perhaps the fragment is from a smaller molecule, but the compound is larger. Alternatively, maybe the fragment is a result of a McLafferty rearrangement or some other fragmentation mechanism. Hmm.

Let me think about the molecular formulas again and see which options fit the data.

We have O-H (broad peak), which suggests an alcohol or carboxylic acid. And a carbonyl at 1700 cm⁻¹, maybe an ester or ketone.

The NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, so a double bond is present.

So possible structures could be a vinyl ester, or a vinyl alcohol (but that's less common), or perhaps a cyclohexene ring with an ester group.

Wait, if the compound has a vinyl group (double bond) and an ester group, then the DoU would be two: one for the double bond and one for the ester (which is a double bond). So the formula should have at least two DoU.

Looking at the options:

Option A: C6H12O2 → DoU 0 → no, can't have any double bonds or rings.

Option B: C6H10O → DoU 2 → which could account for two double bonds or a ring and a double bond.

Option C: C6H10O2 → DoU 1 → which could only account for one DoU. So if the compound has a vinyl group (double bond), that's one, and the ester group would be another, but that would require two DoUs, which this option doesn't have. So this might not fit.

Option D: C6H12O → DoU 1 → which could account for one ring or double bond.

So, let's reevaluate. If the compound has a vinyl group (DoU 1) and an ester (DoU 1), then the total DoU would be 2. So the formula must have two DoU.

Looking at the options, only option B (C6H10O) has DoU 2.

Wait, option B is C6H10O, which has DoU (2*6 +2 -10 -1)/2 = (14-11)/2=3/2=1.5. Wait, that can't be right. Oh no, wait, I must have miscalculated earlier. Let me do it again.

Wait, correct formula for DoU is (2n +2 - m - x)/2, where n=number of carbons, m=hydrogens, x=halogens. But oxygen is not included in this calculation. So for C6H10O:

n=6, m=10, x=0.

DoU = (2*6 +2 -10 -0)/2 = (14-10)/2=4/2=2. So DoU is 2. So two degrees of unsaturation: this could be one ring and one double bond, or two double bonds, etc.

So, option B has DoU 2, which would allow for both a double bond (from vinyl H) and a carbonyl group (ester or ketone). But wait, the formula is C6H10O, which would have a molecular weight of 6*12 +10 +16=72+10+16=98.

If the molecular weight is 98, then the fragment at 45 would be about half of that, which is possible.

But let's think about the functional groups. If option B is correct, the formula is C6H10O. So possible structures could be an ester (but wait, an ester would require two O's: one from the ester O and another from the carbonyl O. So for an ester, the formula would be CnH2mO2. Wait, is that correct? No, wait, an ester has the formula R-O-CO-R'. So the general formula is CnH2mO2. So if the formula is C6H10O, which has only one O, then it can't be an ester. So perhaps it's a ketone with an alcohol group (but that would require O-H and O in the ketone, but only one O in the formula? No, because ketone is O in the carbonyl, and O in the alcohol would require two O's. So this is confusing.

Wait, perhaps the compound has a carbonyl group (like a ketone) and an alcohol group. So for that, the formula would need two O's, which would be option A or C.

But earlier, I thought that option B has only one O, so it can't have both an O-H and a carbonyl group because that would require two O's.

Hmm, maybe I'm mixing up something. Let's think again. The FTIR shows O-H (broad) and two carbonyl peaks. Wait, but the carbonyl is a double bond, which requires one O. So the O-H would be another O. So that's two O's. So the formula must have two O's. So looking at the options, only options A, C have two O's.

Wait, option A: C6H12O2 → DoU 0. But that would imply no double bonds or rings, which contradicts the presence of a vinyl group (double bond). So that can't be.

Option C: C6H10O2 → DoU 1. So one DoU, which could be a double bond. But then, the presence of a carbonyl (another double bond) would require another DoU. So that's not possible with this formula. So this is confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the carbonyl is part of a ring, so the DoU only counts once.

Wait, another thought: maybe the compound is a cyclic ketone with an alcohol group. But that would require two O's, which would be option C or A.

But if the formula is C6H10O2, DoU is 1. So that would allow for a ring (which accounts for one DoU) and a double bond (another DoU), but the formula only allows for one DoU. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to summarize:

- FTIR: O-H (broad at ~3000), carbonyl peaks at 1700 and 1650. So possible functional groups: two carbonyl groups? Or one carbonyl and an aromatic ring.

- 1H NMR: vinyl H implies a double bond.

- Mass Spec: fragment at 45.

If the compound has a double bond (DoU 1) and a carbonyl group (DoU 1), total DoU is 2. So the formula must have at least two DoU.

Looking at the options:

Option B: C6H10O → DoU 2. So that's possible. But with only one O, how can it have both O-H and a carbonyl group? Because O-H is -OH (needs O), and carbonyl needs another O. So two O's are needed. So option B can't be correct, because it only has one O.

So the only other options with two O's are A and C.

Option A: C6H12O2 → DoU 0. But that can't have any double bonds or rings, which contradicts the vinyl H. So option A is out.

Option C: C6H10O2 → DoU 1. So one DoU. So it could be a ring (like a six-membered ring) with a carbonyl group. But then, where is the double bond from the vinyl H?

Ah, wait! Maybe the structure is a cyclic ester, like a lactone. A lactone has a ring (contributing one DoU) and the ester carbonyl (another DoU), but that would require two DoU, but the formula only allows one. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm. I'm getting stuck here. Let me try another approach.

The Mass Spec fragment at m/z 45. Let me think about what possible groups have that mass.

45 can be:

- (CH3)COOH? Wait, that's 60.

Wait, no, maybe (CH3)COH is 45. Let's compute:

Carbon: 2 (from CH3 and COH), but wait, CH3 is 1 carbon, COH is 2? No, wait, (CH3)COH is CH3-C-O-H? Wait, no, that's not right. The formula for (CH3)COH is C2H6O2? No, wait, it's actually CH3COH, which is propan-2-ol. Wait, no, propan-2-ol is (CH3)2CHOH. So maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, another approach: 45 is the molecular weight of (CH3)2CO (which is acetone), but that's 58. No, that's not right.

Alternatively, maybe it's a fragment from ethyl acetate. The molecular formula for ethyl acetate is C4H8O2. The molecular weight is 88. If it breaks into a fragment of 45, that would be possible. Wait, (CH3CO) is 58 (CH3COO- is 60, but maybe a fragment without the O). Hmm, not sure.

Wait, another idea: the fragment could be the methyl ester group. The methyl group (CH3O) is 32, but that's not 45. Or perhaps the acetyl group (CH3CO) is 43. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is from a benzene ring with a substituent. Like, if the compound is methyl benzoate, the molecular weight is 136. If it breaks into a benzene ring (78) plus something else, but that's not 45.

Wait, maybe the fragment is a ketone. For example, if the compound is cyclohexanone, the fragment could be the cyclohexyl group, but that's 82, not 45.

I'm not making progress on the Mass Spec part, so maybe I should focus more on the other data.

The FTIR has a broad peak around 3000 cm⁻¹, which suggests an O-H group. The presence of a carbonyl group at 1700 cm⁻¹ suggests an ester or ketone. The 1650 peak could be from an aromatic ring's C=C stretching, which is around 1450-1600 cm⁻¹. So perhaps the compound has an aromatic ring and an ester group.

If it's an aromatic ester, then the structure would be something like a benzene ring with an ester substituent. The ester would have the carbonyl peak around 1700.

The NMR shows vinyl protons, which would be on the benzene ring if it's a mono-substituted aromatic ring with a substituent like an ester. Wait, but benzene itself doesn’t have vinyl protons unless it's part of a conjugated diene or a substituted ring with double bonds.

Alternatively, maybe the compound is an aromatic ester with a vinyl group attached. For example, something like methyl vinyl benzoate. But I'm not sure.

Wait, the molecular formula needs to fit. Let's consider option C: C6H10O2. That's 6 carbons, 10 hydrogens, two oxygens.

If the structure is a benzene ring (C6H5-) with an ester group, the formula would be C6H5-O-CO-O-R, but that would have more oxygen. Alternatively, perhaps it's C6H5-O-CO-R. Wait, but that would require more carbons.

Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclic ester, like a five-membered ring. For example, gamma-butyrolactone is a four-membered ring, but that's C4H6O2. Hmm.

Alternatively, the compound could be methyl cyclohexene carboxylate. Wait, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a diethyl ester, but that's not fitting the formula.

Wait, another thought: the molecular formula C6H10O2 could be something like methyl cyclohex-2-ene-1-carboxylate. That would have a six-membered ring (C6H10O2: the ring has 6 carbons, 10 hydrogens, and two oxygens from the ester group). Let's count hydrogens: the cyclohexene has 10 H (since it's a ring with one double bond: 2n +2 - m = 2*6 +2 -10=14-10=4, so DoU is 2: one from the ring, one from the double bond. Wait, but the formula's DoU is 1. Hmm, this is getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is an ester with a vinyl group. For example, something like CH2=CH-O-CO-R. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe it's a substituted cyclopentene with an ester group. For example, cyclopentene with an ester substituent. But I'm not sure.

Wait, going back to the options, the only formula that has two oxygen atoms is options A and C. And option C has the correct number of O's and a DoU of 1, which could be a ring or a double bond.

But the NMR shows vinyl protons, so it must have a double bond. So the DoU must account for that. So with option C, DoU is 1, which could be a double bond. So the structure would have a double bond and an ester group (which has a carbonyl, another double bond). But then that would require two DoU, but the formula only allows one.

Wait, perhaps the ester's carbonyl is part of the same conjugated system as the double bond. For example, if the double bond is conjugated to the carbonyl, making it a conjugated diene. But that would require another DoU. Hmm, I'm getting stuck.

Alternatively, maybe the compound is a bicyclic structure, but that's getting too complex.

Let me try to think of another approach. The Mass Spec fragment at 45. What if it's from a methyl ester group?

Methyl group is 15 (CH3). The ester group (COO) is 44 (12+16+16+1+1? Wait, no, methyl ester is O-CO-OCH3. So the methyl ester group adds 45? Let's compute: O is 16, COO is 12+16*2=44, plus CH3 is 15. Wait, no, O-CO-O-CH3: the fragment would be the entire ester group. The molecular weight of the ester group (O-CO-OCH3) is 16 + (12+16*2) + (12 +3*1) = 16 + 44 +15=75. That's too high.

Wait, perhaps the fragment is the acetyl group (CH3CO-) which is 43. Hmm, close to 45 but not quite.

Wait, another possibility: the fragment is (CH2)2CO, which is 58. No, that's higher than 45.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is CH3COOH, which is 60. No, not 45.

Wait, perhaps the fragment is a propyl group attached to something. Propyl is 3*12 +8=44. Hmm, close to 45 but not exactly.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a COO- group attached to a methyl, which would be 45. Let me calculate: COO- is 44 (12+16*2 +0?), plus CH3 would be 15. No, that's 59. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: the fragment could be a ketene ion, but I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is something like (CH2O) which is formaldehyde, but that's 30. No, that's not it.

I'm stuck on the Mass Spec part, so let me think of other possibilities.

The FTIR shows a strong peak at 1700, which is typical of esters or ketones. The 1650 peak could be a conjugated carbonyl, like in an aromatic ring. So the compound might be an aromatic ester, like methyl benzoate. But methyl benzoate has a molecular formula of C8H8O2. None of the options here match that, so that's not it.

Wait, but the options are C6H10O2, which is 6 carbons. So perhaps it's a substituted cyclohexene with an ester group.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a cyclic ester (lactone) with a double bond. For example, a five-membered ring lactone with a double bond.

Wait, a five-membered ring would have the ester group. So the formula would be C5H8O2. But our option is C6H10O2. So that's not matching.

Alternatively, the compound could be an ester with a vinyl group. For example, vinyl acetate is C4H6O2, but our option is C6H10O2, which is more carbons and hydrogens.

Hmm.

Let me think about the possible structures of each option.

Option A: C6H12O2 → Degrees of unsaturation 0 → All single bonds. But then, where are the carbonyl and the double bond? They can't be present. So this is unlikely.

Option B: C6H10O → Degrees of unsaturation 2 → Could have two double bonds or a ring and a double bond. But only one O, so can't have both O-H and carbonyl. So this is unlikely.

Option C: C6H10O2 → Degrees of unsaturation 1 → Could have a ring or one double bond. But we have a vinyl group, which is another double bond. So that's two DoU needed, which this formula doesn't have. So this is conflicting.

Option D: C6H12O → Degrees of unsaturation 1 → Could have a ring or one double bond. But again, the O is only one, so can't have both O-H and carbonyl. So this is unlikely.

Wait, but option C has two O's, which would allow for both O-H and carbonyl groups. So maybe the structure is an ester with a ring. For example, a cyclic ester (lactone) with an O-H group. But wait, lactones don't have O-H groups. They are cyclic esters, which don't have free -OH groups.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a hemiacetal or some other structure, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: the FTIR shows a broad peak at 3000, which could be an alcohol. And a strong peak at 1700, which could be an ester. So the structure would be an alcohol (O-H) and an ester (O-CO-O). But that would require three O's. Because the ester has two O's (one from the ester linkage, one from the carbonyl), and the alcohol has one O. So that would be three O's in the formula. But the options don't have three O's. So this can't be.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think about the possible functional groups again.

The FTIR shows a broad O-H peak, which could also be from a carboxylic acid. A carboxylic acid has O-H (broad, around 2500-3500), and a carbonyl around 1700. So the two carbonyl peaks (1700 and 1650) could be the carboxylic acid's carbonyl and maybe an aromatic ring's C=C.

But then, the molecular formula would have two O's: one from the -COOH and another from the ring. Wait, but a carboxylic acid has the formula RCOOH, which is CnH2nO2. So for n=6, that would be C6H12O2, which is option A. But option A's DoU is 0, which can't have any double bonds or rings.

So that's not possible.

Wait, but if the compound is a carboxylic acid with a double bond, that would require two DoU. But option A has DoU 0, which can't have any. So that's not possible.

This is getting really confusing. Let me try to think of possible structures that fit the data.

The FTIR suggests O-H (broad) and two carbonyl groups. Or O-H and a conjugated carbonyl and something else.

The NMR shows vinyl H, so a double bond.

The Mass Spec shows a fragment at 45.

The only options with two O's are A and C. Option A can't have any double bonds, so it's out. So option C must be the correct one.

Option C: C6H10O2. DoU 1. So perhaps the structure has a ring (C6H10O2 would have a six-membered ring with an ester group or a ketone and an O-H group).

Wait, but with DoU 1, and a vinyl group (double bond), that would require two DoU. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the structure is a cyclic ester (lactone) with a vinyl group as part of the ring. For example, a five-membered ring with a double bond. Let's see: a five-membered ring with an ester group would have the formula C5H8O2. But our option is C6H10O2, which is C6. So perhaps a six-membered ring with an ester group and a double bond.

Wait, a six-membered ring with an ester group and a double bond would have a formula like C6H8O2. Because a six-membered ring with one double bond has 2n +2 - (m) = 2*6 +2 - m = 14 - m = DoU 2. So with m=8, DoU= (14-8)/2=3. No, I'm getting mixed up.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a six-membered ring with an ester group (O-CO-O) and a double bond elsewhere. The formula would be C6H10O2, which matches option C.

So the structure would have a ring (contributing one DoU) and a double bond (another DoU), but the formula only allows one DoU. Hmm, that doesn't fit.

Wait, no. If it's a six-membered ring with an ester group and a double bond, then the total DoU would be two: one from the ring, one from the double bond. But the formula C6H10O2 has DoU 1. So that's conflicting.

I'm stuck. Let me try to make a decision based on the given data.

The FTIR suggests O-H and a carbonyl. The NMR has vinyl H, so a double bond. The Mass Spec has a fragment at 45.

The only options with two O's are A and C.

Option A: No DoU → can't have any double bonds or rings. So not possible.

Option C: DoU 1. So must have either a ring or a double bond.

But the NMR shows a double bond (vinyl H). So the structure must have a double bond. Therefore, option C must have a double bond (DoU 1), but then the carbonyl would be another DoU, which is impossible. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the carbonyl is part of a ring, so it doesn't count as an additional DoU. For example, a cyclic ester (lactone) has a ring and a carbonyl, but the ring accounts for the DoU.

But then, where is the vinyl H from? It would need another DoU, which option C doesn't have.

I think I've exhausted all possibilities and have to make a choice.

The fragment at 45 suggests a possible (CH3)CO group, which is 43, but close. The presence of a carbonyl at 1700 suggests an ester. The O-H suggests an alcohol. But the formula must have two O's, which would be option C.

So, despite the confusion, I think the correct answer is option C: C6H10O2.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves identifying an unknown compound based on spectroscopic data: FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The options provided are C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, and C6H12O. Each piece of data is analyzed as follows:

### FTIR Analysis:
- A broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ indicates the presence of an O-H group (likely from an alcohol or carboxylic acid).
- Peaks at 1700 cm⁻¹ and 1650 cm⁻¹ suggest the presence of carbonyl groups. The 1700 cm⁻¹ peak is typical of esters or ketones, while the 1650 cm⁻¹ peak could correspond to a conjugated carbonyl or an aromatic C=C stretch.

### 1H NMR Analysis:
- The presence of peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens indicates the compound contains a double bond.

### Mass Spectrometry:
- A fragment peak at m/z = 45 suggests a possible fragment with a molecular weight of 45. This could correspond to small groups like (CH3)CO or similar.

### Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU):
- The molecular formula determines the DoU using the formula:  
  \[
  \text{DoU} = \frac{2n + 2 - m - x}{2}
  \]
  where \(n\) is the number of carbons, \(m\) is the number of hydrogens, and \(x\) is the number of halogens (assumed to be 0 here).  
  - **Option A (C6H12O2):** DoU = 0. This implies no double bonds or rings, which contradicts the presence of a vinyl group (double bond).  
  - **Option B (C6H10O):** DoU = 2. This allows for two double bonds or a ring and a double bond. However, with only one oxygen, it cannot simultaneously accommodate both an O-H group and a carbonyl group.  
  - **Option C (C6H10O2):** DoU = 1. This allows for either one double bond or one ring. The presence of a vinyl group (double bond) accounts for this DoU, but the carbonyl group would typically require another DoU, which is not available.  
  - **Option D (C6H12O):** DoU = 1. This allows for one double bond or one ring. However, with only one oxygen, it cannot simultaneously accommodate both an O-H group and a carbonyl group.

### Key Observations:
- The FTIR data suggests the compound has both an O-H group and carbonyl groups, requiring at least two oxygen atoms. This eliminates options B and D, which have only one oxygen.
- Option A is eliminated because it has zero DoU, which cannot account for the presence of a vinyl group (double bond).
- Option C (C6H10O2) is the only formula left. It has two oxygen atoms, allowing for both an O-H group and a carbonyl group. The DoU of 1 can account for the vinyl group (double bond), assuming the carbonyl is part of a conjugated system or ring.

### Conclusion:
Based on the spectroscopic data and molecular formula analysis, the compound is most consistent with **C6H10O2**.
