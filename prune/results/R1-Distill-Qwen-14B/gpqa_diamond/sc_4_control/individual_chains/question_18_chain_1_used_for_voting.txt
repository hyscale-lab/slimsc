Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their elemental abundances. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question gives me two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their masses are 1.5 and 1.2 times the Sun's mass, respectively. But wait, do their masses matter for this particular problem? The question is about the ratio of silicon atoms in their photospheres. So maybe the mass isn't directly relevant, unless it affects their evolution or something else, but the question gives me all the abundances, so maybe I can ignore the masses here.

The data given are the elemental abundance ratios using the EW method under LTE. The Sun's photospheric composition is also provided. Let me list out all the given values:

For Star_1:
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex

For Star_2:
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex

And the Sun's photosphere:
- 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 → so log(nFe/nH) = 7.5 - 12 = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5)
- 12 + log10(nMg/nH) = 7 → log(nMg/nH) = 7 -12 = -5 → nMg/nH = 10^(-5)

Wait, what do these [X/Y] mean? Oh right, the notation [X/Y] = log10(n_X / n_Y) - log10(n_X / n_Y)_sun. So it's the logarithm of the ratio of the number densities of X to Y relative to the solar ratio.

So for Star_1, [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3. That means log(n_Si/n_Fe)_star1 / log(n_Si/n_Fe)_sun = 0.3. Alternatively, the ratio (n_Si/n_Fe) in Star_1 is 10^(0.3) times that in the Sun.

Wait, no, the formula is [X/Y] = log(n_X/n_Y) - log(n_X/n_Y)_sun = log(n_X/n_Y)_star - log(n_X/n_Y)_sun. So for Star_1, [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3.

So the formula is:

log(n_Si/n_Fe)_star1 = log(n_Si/n_Fe)_sun + 0.3

Similarly, [Fe/H]_1 is 0. So log(n_Fe/n_H)_star1 = log(n_Fe/n_H)_sun + 0. So n_Fe/n_H in Star_1 is same as in the Sun.

Wait, n_Fe/n_H in the Sun is 10^(-4.5), as calculated earlier. So in Star_1, it's the same. So n_Fe/n_H = 10^(-4.5) in Star_1.

Now, for Star_1, let's compute n_Si/n_H.

Because [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3, so log(n_Si/n_Fe)_star1 = log(n_Si/n_Fe)_sun + 0.3.

Compute log(n_Si/n_Fe)_sun. Wait, no, I think I can get n_Si in terms of n_Fe.

Wait, for the Sun, I can find n_Si/n_Fe. Because n_Si and n_Fe are both known relative to n_H.

Wait, Sun's n_Si is not given directly. Oh right, the Sun's photosphere gives nFe and nMg relative to nH. Wait, so I have nFe and nMg in terms of H. But what about Si?

Hmm, the Sun's [Si/Fe] is another parameter. Or wait, maybe I can find it from the data given.

Wait, the Sun's [Si/Fe] would be log(n_Si/n_Fe) - log(n_Si/n_Fe)_sun_sun, which is zero. So log(n_Si/n_Fe)_sun = [Si/Fe]_sun. But since [Si/Fe] is given as [X/Y], the solar value is zero. So for the Sun, [Si/Fe]_sun = 0, which implies log(n_Si/n_Fe) = log(n_Si/n_Fe)_sun, which is the same as log(n_Si/n_Fe) in Sun is the same as for the Sun, which is zero. Wait, that can't be right. Maybe I should think differently.

Wait, no. The [X/Y] notation is defined as log10(n_X/n_Y) - log10(n_X/n_Y)_sun. So for the Sun, [X/Y] is zero. So for Star_1, [Si/Fe] is 0.3, which is log(n_Si/n_Fe)_star1 - log(n_Si/n_Fe)_sun = 0.3. Since log(n_Si/n_Fe)_sun is zero, then log(n_Si/n_Fe)_star1 is 0.3. So n_Si/n_Fe (star1) = 10^0.3 ≈ 2. So n_Si = 2 * n_Fe.

But in Star_1, n_Fe/n_H is the same as in Sun, which is 10^(-4.5). So n_Fe = 10^(-4.5) * n_H.

Thus, n_Si = 2 * (10^(-4.5) n_H) → n_Si = 2 * 10^(-4.5) n_H.

But wait, in the Sun, n_Si is not given. Hmm, maybe I need to find it in terms of n_Mg or something else.

Wait, the Sun's [Mg/H] is 12 + log(nMg/nH) =7, which as earlier gives log(nMg/nH)= -5 → nMg = 1e-5 nH.

But I don't have information about Si in the Sun's photosphere, unless I can find [Mg/Si] in the Sun.

Wait, for the Sun, [Mg/Si] would be log(nMg/nSi) - log(nMg/nSi)_sun. Wait, but without knowing the Sun's [Mg/Si], I can't compute it. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I don't need the Sun's [Mg/Si]. Because for Star_2, the [Mg/Si] is given as 0.3. So for Star_2, [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3. So log(nMg/nSi)_star2 - log(nMg/nSi)_sun = 0.3.

But wait, I don't know the Sun's log(nMg/nSi). Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express ratios in terms of H.

For Star_1:

We can find n_Si/n_H.

We know n_Si/n_Fe = 2 → n_Si = 2 n_Fe.

n_Fe = 10^(-4.5) n_H.

So n_Si = 2 * 10^(-4.5) n_H.

So the ratio n_Si/n_H in Star_1 is 2e-4.5.

In Star_2:

We have [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 → log(nMg/nSi)_star2 = log(nMg/nSi)_sun + 0.3.

But I don't know the Sun's nMg/nSi. Wait, but the Sun's nMg is given as 1e-5 nH.

We can compute nMg/nSi in the Sun.

Wait, but I don't have n_Si for the Sun. Oh wait, perhaps I can find it.

The Sun's [Fe/H] is given as 7.5 in the question? Wait, no. The Sun's 12 + log(nFe/nH) =7.5 → log(nFe/nH) =-4.5 → nFe = 1e-4.5 nH.

Similarly, log(nMg/nH) =-5 → nMg = 1e-5 nH.

But what about n_Si? Hmm, I don't have it. Unless I can find it via another approach.

Wait, maybe the question is asking for the ratio of [Si/Star_1] to [Si/Star_2], but no, it's the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So (n_Si)_1 / (n_Si)_2.

Wait, but to compute that, I need to find n_Si in each star relative to H, perhaps.

Wait, but maybe I can find n_Si in each star in terms of H and then find the ratio.

For Star_1:

n_Si = 2 * n_Fe = 2 * (1e-4.5 n_H) → 2e-4.5 n_H.

For Star_2:

We have [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 → log(nMg/nSi)_2 = log(nMg/nSi)_sun + 0.3.

But I don't know log(nMg/nSi)_sun. Hmm. Can I find it from the Sun's data?

Wait, in the Sun, nMg=1e-5 nH, and nFe=1e-4.5 nH. But what about n_Si?

Wait, perhaps I can find n_Si in the Sun using [Fe/H]_sun. Wait, the Sun's [Fe/H] is given for Star_1 as 0, but the Sun's own [Fe/H] is 0 by definition. Wait, no. Let me re-read the question.

Wait, the given data are for the stars. The Sun's data are given as 12 + log(nFe/nH)=7.5 and 12 + log(nMg/nH)=7.

So, for the Sun:

n_Fe = 1e-4.5 n_H.

n_Mg = 1e-5 n_H.

But I don't have n_Si for the Sun. Hmm. So perhaps I can't directly compute the Sun's [Mg/Si], which would be log(nMg/nSi)_sun.

Wait, but maybe I don't need to. Let's think about Star_2.

Star_2 has [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3, and [Mg/H]_2=0.

So [Mg/H]_2 is 0, meaning that log(nMg/nH)_star2 = log(nMg/nH)_sun + 0 → nMg/nH = same as Sun, so nMg = 1e-5 n_H.

So in Star_2, nMg = 1e-5 n_H.

We also know that [Mg/Si]_2 is 0.3. So log(nMg/nSi)_2 = log(nMg/nSi)_sun + 0.3.

But wait, I can express nMg/nSi in Star_2 as 10^{0.3} times the Sun's nMg/nSi.

Wait, because [Mg/Si] is defined as log(nMg/nSi) - log_sun, so [Mg/Si] = 0.3 → log(nMg/nSi)_star2 = log(nMg/nSi)_sun + 0.3.

So nMg/nSi (star2) = 10^{0.3} * (nMg/nSi)_sun.

But in the Sun, nMg is 1e-5 nH, and nSi is something, which I don't know.

Wait, but maybe I can express nSi in the Sun in terms of nH.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the ratio of nSi in Star_2 to nH, and then get the ratio between Star_1 and Star_2.

Let me think.

In Star_2:

nMg = 1e-5 nH (since [Mg/H] is 0 → same as Sun).

[Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 → log(nMg/nSi)_2 = log(nMg/nSi)_sun + 0.3.

But in the Sun, nMg/nSi is (1e-5 nH) / (nSi_sun) → because nMg is 1e-5 nH, and nSi_sun is the number of silicon atoms per H.

So the Sun's (nMg/nSi)_sun = (1e-5) / (nSi_sun).

In Star_2, (nMg/nSi)_star2 = 10^{0.3} * (1e-5 / nSi_sun).

But nMg in Star_2 is 1e-5 nH, as [Mg/H] is 0. So nMg = 1e-5 nH.

So,

nMg / nSi = (1e-5 nH) / nSi.

Which equals 10^{0.3} * (1e-5 /nSi_sun).

So,

(1e-5 nH)/nSi = 10^{0.3} * (1e-5 /nSi_sun )

Divide both sides by 1e-5:

nH / nSi = 10^{0.3} / nSi_sun.

Rearranged:

nSi = nH * nSi_sun / 10^{0.3}.

So,

nSi = (nSi_sun / 10^{0.3}) ) * nH.

Which is nSi = (nSi_sun ) * 10^{-0.3} * nH.

Because 1/10^{0.3} is 10^{-0.3}.

So, nSi in Star_2 is (nSi_sun * 10^{-0.3}) ) times nH.

Wait, but I don't know nSi_sun. Hmm.

Wait, but in the Sun, we have nFe = 1e-4.5 nH, and nMg = 1e-5 nH. What about nSi?

I don't have that data. So perhaps I can't proceed directly. Hmm.

Wait, but maybe I can express the ratio of nSi in Star_1 and Star_2 in terms of nSi_sun.

Wait, let's see.

In Star_1, nSi = 2e-4.5 nH.

In Star_2, nSi = (nSi_sun * 10^{-0.3}) ) *nH.

So the ratio (nSi)_1 / (nSi)_2 = (2e-4.5 nH) / (nSi_sun * 10^{-0.3} * nH) )

nH cancels out.

So ratio = (2e-4.5) / (nSi_sun * 10^{-0.3} )

Which is (2 / (nSi_sun)) * (10^{-4.5} / 10^{-0.3} )

Which is (2 / (nSi_sun)) * 10^{-4.5 + 0.3} → 10^{-4.2}.

So, ratio = (2 * 10^{-4.2}) / nSi_sun.

Hmm. But I don't know nSi_sun. Wait, but can I find nSi_sun in terms of other known quantities?

In the Sun, [Fe/H] is not the same as for Star_1. Wait, [Fe/H] is log(nFe/nH) - log_sun(nFe/nH). Oh wait, [Fe/H] for Star_1 is 0, meaning that log(nFe/nH) for Star_1 is the same as the Sun's. So Star_1's nFe/nH = Sun's nFe/nH.

But for the Sun's [Fe/H], which is 0, that's Sun's own [Fe/H] is zero, so Sun's nFe/nH is the same as in Star_1. But in Star_1, nFe/nH is same as Sun.

Wait, but the Sun's nFe is 1e-4.5 nH, as given.

Wait, but how does this help with nSi_sun?

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I can think about the solar [Mg/Si]. Because in the Sun, [Mg/Si] would be log(nMg/nSi) - log(nMg/nSi)_sun=0. So [Mg/Si]_sun is zero.

Wait, wait, no. The [X/Y] notation is relative to the Sun. So if we compute [Mg/Si] for the Sun, it's zero. So nMg/nSi in the Sun is the same as in the Sun, which is trivial. So [Mg/Si]_sun is zero.

But I don't have any data about [Mg/Si] for the Sun.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should think of another approach.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the ratio of silicon in Star_1 to Star_2.

n_Si_1 = 2e-4.5 n_H.

n_Si_2 = (nSi_sun * 10^{-0.3}) n_H.

So, the ratio is (2e-4.5) / (nSi_sun * 10^{-0.3} )

So, ratio = 2 * 10^{-4.5} / (nSi_sun * 10^{-0.3}) )

= 2 * 10^{-4.5 + 0.3} / nSi_sun → 2 * 10^{-4.2} / nSi_sun.

Hmm, but without knowing nSi_sun, I can't compute this. So perhaps there's another way.

Wait, perhaps I can relate n_Si in the Sun to n_Mg or n_Fe in the Sun. Since I know nMg and nFe in the Sun.

Wait, for the Sun, nMg = 1e-5 nH.

nFe = 1e-4.5 nH.

But what about nSi? I don't have data on that.

Wait, perhaps I can use the fact that [Mg/Si]_2 is 0.3, and [Mg/H]_2 is 0. So in Star_2, nMg is 1e-5 nH.

So in Star_2, nMg/nSi = 10^{0.3} * (nMg_Sun / nSi_Sun)

Because [Mg/Si] = log(nMg/nSi) - log(nMg/nSi)_sun.

So log(nMg/nSi)_2 = 0.3 + log(nMg/nSi)_sun.

Which implies that (nMg/nSi)_2 = 10^{0.3} * (nMg/nSi)_sun.

So,

(1e-5 nH) / (nSi_2) = 10^{0.3} * (1e-5 nH) / (nSi_sun) )

Wait, because nMg_Sun is 1e-5 nH, and nSi_Sun is nSi_sun.

Okay, so from that equation:

Left side: (1e-5 nH) / nSi_2 → Right side: 10^{0.3} * (1e-5 nH) / nSi_sun.

Cancel 1e-5 nH from both sides:

1/(nSi_2) = 10^{0.3} * 1/(nSi_sun) → nSi_2 = nSi_sun / 10^{0.3}

So, nSi_2 = nSi_sun * 10^{-0.3}

So, going back to the ratio:

(nSi_1) / (nSi_2) = [2e-4.5 ] / [nSi_sun * 10^{-0.3} ]

But wait, in the Sun, nFe = 1e-4.5 nH.

So, in the Sun, nSi_sun can be found if we know the [Si/Fe] in the Sun.

Wait, but [Si/Fe] in the Sun is zero, because that's the reference point.

So, [Si/Fe]_sun = log(nSi/nFe)_sun - log(nSi/nFe)_sun = 0.

Which implies that nSi/nFe in the Sun is 1. So,

nSi_sun / nFe_sun = 1 → nSi_sun = nFe_sun.

But nFe_sun is 1e-4.5 nH.

So nSi_sun = 1e-4.5 nH.

Ah! Now I can find nSi_sun.

So,

nSi_sun = 1e-4.5 nH.

So, now substituting back into the ratio:

(nSi_1) / (nSi_2) = (2e-4.5 ) / ( (1e-4.5 nH) * 10^{-0.3} ) )

Wait, wait, no. Let me re-express.

Earlier, I found that:

nSi_1 = 2e-4.5 nH.

nSi_2 = (nSi_sun) * 10^{-0.3} → which is (1e-4.5 nH) * 10^{-0.3}.

So,

nSi_1 = 2e-4.5 nH.

nSi_2 = 1e-4.5 * 10^{-0.3} nH.

So,

Ratio = (2e-4.5) / (1e-4.5 * 10^{-0.3} )

e-4.5 cancels out.

So,

Ratio = 2 / 10^{-0.3} → 2 * 10^{0.3}.

10^{0.3} is approximately 2, because 10^{0.3} ≈ 2.

Wait, because 10^{0.3} is 10^(3/10) → which is about 2.

Wait, 10^0.3: 10^0.3 ≈ 2 because 2^10 is 1024, which is about 10^3. So 2 is 10^(0.3010), so yes, 10^0.3 is approximately 2.

So, 10^0.3 ≈ 2 → 2 * 2 =4.

Wait, but wait, 0.3 * log10(2) = 0.3 * 0.3010 ≈ 0.0903, so 10^0.3 is about 2. So yes.

So, ratio ≈ 2 * 2 =4.

Looking at the options, option A is ~3.9, which is approximately 4. So answer is A.

Wait, but let me be precise. Let me calculate 10^0.3 accurately.

10^0.3: Let's compute it.

ln(10^0.3) = 0.3 ln(10) ≈ 0.3 * 2.302585 ≈ 0.6907755.

e^0.6907755 ≈ 2. So yes, it's about 2.

So 2 * 2 is 4. So the ratio is about 4, which is option A: ~3.9.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2, we analyze the given elemental abundances and use the provided photospheric composition of the Sun.

### Key Data:
1. **Star_1**:
   - [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex: This implies that the ratio of silicon to iron in Star_1 is \( 10^{0.3} \) times that of the Sun.
   - [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex: The ratio of iron to hydrogen in Star_1 is the same as in the Sun.

2. **Star_2**:
   - [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex: This implies that the ratio of magnesium to silicon in Star_2 is \( 10^{0.3} \) times that of the Sun.
   - [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex: The ratio of magnesium to hydrogen in Star_2 is the same as in the Sun.

3. **Sun's Photosphere**:
   - \( 12 + \log_{10}(n_{\text{Fe}}/n_{\text{H}}) = 7.5 \): This gives \( \log_{10}(n_{\text{Fe}}/n_{\text{H}}) = -4.5 \), so \( n_{\text{Fe}}/n_{\text{H}} = 10^{-4.5} \).
   - \( 12 + \log_{10}(n_{\text{Mg}}/n_{\text{H}}) = 7 \): This gives \( \log_{10}(n_{\text{Mg}}/n_{\text{H}}) = -5 \), so \( n_{\text{Mg}}/n_{\text{H}} = 10^{-5} \).

### Analysis:
#### Step 1: Silicon-to-Hydrogen Ratio in Star_1
From [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3, we know:
\[
\log_{10}(n_{\text{Si}}/n_{\text{Fe}})_{\text{Star_1}} = \log_{10}(n_{\text{Si}}/n_{\text{Fe}})_{\text{Sun}} + 0.3
\]
Since [Si/Fe] in the Sun is 0, \( \log_{10}(n_{\text{Si}}/n_{\text{Fe}})_{\text{Sun}} = 0 \). Thus:
\[
\log_{10}(n_{\text{Si}}/n_{\text{Fe}})_{\text{Star_1}} = 0.3
\]
This gives:
\[
n_{\text{Si}}/n_{\text{Fe}} = 10^{0.3} \approx 2
\]
In Star_1, \( n_{\text{Fe}}/n_{\text{H}} = 10^{-4.5} \) (same as the Sun). Therefore:
\[
n_{\text{Si}} = 2 \cdot n_{\text{Fe}} = 2 \cdot 10^{-4.5} \cdot n_{\text{H}}
\]

#### Step 2: Silicon-to-Hydrogen Ratio in Star_2
From [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3, we know:
\[
\log_{10}(n_{\text{Mg}}/n_{\text{Si}})_{\text{Star_2}} = \log_{10}(n_{\text{Mg}}/n_{\text{Si}})_{\text{Sun}} + 0.3
\]
In the Sun, \( n_{\text{Mg}}/n_{\text{H}} = 10^{-5} \) and \( n_{\text{Si}}/n_{\text{H}} = 10^{-4.5} \) (derived from [Si/Fe] = 0). Thus:
\[
\log_{10}(n_{\text{Mg}}/n_{\text{Si}})_{\text{Sun}} = \log_{10}(10^{-5}/10^{-4.5}) = \log_{10}(10^{-0.5}) = -0.5
\]
So:
\[
\log_{10}(n_{\text{Mg}}/n_{\text{Si}})_{\text{Star_2}} = -0.5 + 0.3 = -0.2
\]
This gives:
\[
n_{\text{Mg}}/n_{\text{Si}} = 10^{-0.2} \approx 0.63
\]
In Star_2, \( n_{\text{Mg}}/n_{\text{H}} = 10^{-5} \) (same as the Sun). Therefore:
\[
n_{\text{Si}} = \frac{n_{\text{Mg}}}{0.63} = \frac{10^{-5} \cdot n_{\text{H}}}{0.63} \approx 1.59 \cdot 10^{-5} \cdot n_{\text{H}}
\]

#### Step 3: Ratio of Silicon in Star_1 to Star_2
The ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 to Star_2 is:
\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si}}_{\text{Star_1}}}{n_{\text{Si}}_{\text{Star_2}}} = \frac{2 \cdot 10^{-4.5} \cdot n_{\text{H}}}{1.59 \cdot 10^{-5} \cdot n_{\text{H}}} = \frac{2 \cdot 10^{-4.5}}{1.59 \cdot 10^{-5}}
\]
Simplify:
\[
\frac{2 \cdot 10^{-4.5}}{1.59 \cdot 10^{-5}} = \frac{2}{1.59} \cdot 10^{-4.5 + 5} = \frac{2}{1.59} \cdot 10^{0.5}
\]
Using \( 10^{0.5} \approx 3.16 \) and \( 2/1.59 \approx 1.25 \):
\[
\frac{2}{1.59} \cdot 10^{0.5} \approx 1.25 \cdot 3.16 \approx 4.0
\]

### Conclusion:
The ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 to Star_2 is approximately **4.0**, which corresponds to **Option A (~3.9)**.

ANSWER: A
