Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to work through it. So, the question is about finding the numerical value of 'a' in a given wave function. Hmm.

The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Wait, so that's a complex wave function. Oh right, wave functions can be complex, that's okay. But when we measure the position, the particle's position is found between x=1 and x=3. And in the ensemble, none were found outside this range. 

So, I remember that for a wave function to be physically valid, it must be normalized. Normalization means the total probability of finding the particle somewhere is 1. So the integral of the absolute square of the wave function over all space should equal 1. 

But wait, in this case, the wave function is non-zero only between x=1 and x=3. So the integral for normalization will be from x=1 to x=3. 

The wave function is ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. To find the normalization, I need to compute the integral of |ψ(x)|² dx from 1 to 3 and set it equal to 1.

Let me compute |ψ(x)|². Since ψ is complex, the absolute square is ψ* * ψ. ψ* is the complex conjugate, so (a / sqrt(1+x)) +0.5i. Multiplying these together:

|ψ|^2 = [a/(sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i] [a/(sqrt(1+x)) + 0.5i] 

That's a product of conjugates, so it becomes (a/(sqrt(1+x)))^2 + (0.5)^2. 

Because (x - yi)(x + yi) = x² + y².

So |ψ(x)|² = (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25. 

Now, the integral from x=1 to x=3 of [ (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx = 1.

Let me split the integral into two parts: integral of a²/(1+x) dx and integral of 0.25 dx.

First, integral of a²/(1+x) dx from 1 to 3. Let u = 1+x, du = dx. The limits when x=1, u=2; x=3, u=4.

So integral becomes a² ∫ (1/u) du from 2 to 4. Which is a² [ln u] from 2 to4 = a² (ln4 - ln2) = a² ln(4/2) = a² ln(2).

Next part: integral of 0.25 dx from 1 to3. That's 0.25*(3-1) = 0.25*2=0.5.

So adding the two parts together: a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So, a² ln(2) = 1 -0.5 = 0.5.

Thus, a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

What's ln(2)? I remember it's approximately 0.6931.

So a² ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ (0.5)/(0.6931) ≈ 0.7202.

Taking the square root, a ≈ sqrt(0.7202) ≈ 0.8485. Hmm, looking at the options:

Options are A) 1.1, B)0.85, C)0.35, D)0.6.

0.8485 is approximately 0.85, which is option B.

To determine the numerical value of \( a \), we start by normalizing the given wave function:

\[
\psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i
\]

The normalization condition requires that the total probability of finding the particle is 1. This means:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} |\psi(x)|^2 dx = 1
\]

The absolute square of the wave function is:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25
\]

Substituting this into the normalization condition:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1
\]

The integral can be split into two parts:

1. **First term**:  
\[
\int_{1}^{3} \frac{a^2}{1+x} dx
\]

Let \( u = 1+x \), so \( du = dx \). The limits change: \( x=1 \to u=2 \), and \( x=3 \to u=4 \). The integral becomes:

\[
a^2 \int_{2}^{4} \frac{1}{u} du = a^2 \left[\ln u\right]_{2}^{4} = a^2 (\ln 4 - \ln 2) = a^2 \ln 2
\]

2. **Second term**:  
\[
\int_{1}^{3} 0.25 dx = 0.25 \cdot (3-1) = 0.5
\]

Adding the two parts:

\[
a^2 \ln 2 + 0.5 = 1
\]

Simplifying:

\[
a^2 \ln 2 = 0.5 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln 2}
\]

Using \( \ln 2 \approx 0.6931 \):

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7202 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a \approx \sqrt{0.7202} \approx 0.8485
\]

From the given options, \( a \approx 0.85 \), which corresponds to **Option B**.
