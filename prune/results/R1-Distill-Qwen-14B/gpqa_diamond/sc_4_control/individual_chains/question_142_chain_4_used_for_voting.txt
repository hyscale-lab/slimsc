Okay, so I have this question about density matrices and their geometrical positions in qubit space. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question gives me a density matrix rho, which is (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). Wait, I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, including both pure and mixed states. So first, I should determine whether this rho represents a pure state or a mixed state.

Looking at the matrix, it's the average of the |0> and |1> projectors. Each of those projectors is a rank-1 matrix, and when you add them together, you get a diagonal matrix with two ones on the diagonal. Multiplying by 1/2 makes it so that the diagonal entries are 0.5 each. So the density matrix rho would look like [[0.5, 0], [0, 0.5]].

Wait, for a pure state, the density matrix is a projector, right? So its rank is 1. But this rho has both diagonal elements as 0.5, so the trace is 1, but the rank is 2 because both terms contribute. So this is definitely a mixed state.

Now, the question is about the geometrical position in the qubit space. I think this refers to the Bloch sphere representation. Oh right, the Bloch sphere is a way to visualize qubit states. For a pure state, the density matrix can be written as (I + r·σ)/2, where r is a vector on the Bloch sphere and σ are the Pauli matrices.

So, for a pure state |psi> = cos(theta/2)|0> + e^{i phi} sin(theta/2)|1>, the Bloch vector r is (x, y, z) = (sin(theta) cos(phi), sin(theta) sin(phi), cos(theta)).

But wait, our rho is a mixed state. How does that translate to the Bloch sphere? I think that any density matrix can be written in terms of the Bloch vector as rho = (I + r·σ)/2, but in that case, the vector r would satisfy ||r|| <= 1. For a pure state, ||r||=1, for a maximally mixed state, like rho = I/2, r would be zero, right?

So let's compute rho. Given rho = (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2. Let me write out the matrices. |0><0| is [[1,0],[0,0]], and |1><1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. Adding them gives [[1,0],[0,1]], which is the identity matrix I. So rho = I/2.

Wait, that makes sense. So rho is the maximally mixed state, because it's equally a mixture of |0> and |1>, each with 50% probability. So in the Bloch sphere terms, the vector r would be zero because rho = I/2. So the corresponding point would be at the origin.

Looking at the options, option C is r=(0,0,0), which matches this. So the geometrical position is at the center.

Wait, let me double-check. If rho is I/2, then it doesn't have any coherence terms, and all the diagonal terms are equal. So yes, r should be zero. So the correct answer is option C.

The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This can be rewritten as 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} = \frac{1}{2} I,
\]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix. This represents the maximally mixed state for a single qubit. In the Bloch sphere representation, any density matrix can be expressed as 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} \right),
\]

where \(\mathbf{r}\) is a vector with components \((x, y, z)\) satisfying \(|\mathbf{r}| \leq 1\), and \(\boldsymbol{\sigma}\) are the Pauli matrices. For the maximally mixed state \(\rho = \frac{1}{2} I\), there are no contributions from the Pauli matrices, meaning \(\mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0)\). Thus, the geometrical position of this density matrix in qubit space is at the origin of the Bloch sphere.

From the given options:
- **A)** \(r = (1, 1, 0)\): Incorrect, as this corresponds to a pure state with non-zero Bloch vector.
- **B)** \(r = (0, 0, 1)\): Incorrect, as this corresponds to a different mixed or pure state.
- **C)** \(r = (0, 0, 0)\): Correct, as this corresponds to the maximally mixed state.
- **D)** \(r = (1, 1, 1)\): Incorrect, as this is not a valid Bloch vector.

The correct answer is **C**, as the density matrix represents the maximally mixed state, which is located at the origin in the Bloch sphere.
