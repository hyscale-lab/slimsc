Okay, so I've got this question about neutrinos from the Sun. Hmm, I need to figure out the flux ratio between two energy bands after the pp-III branch stops. Let me try to think through this.

Wait, so the Sun produces neutrinos through various processes, right? The main one is the proton-proton chain, and I think there are different branches. The pp-I, pp-II, and pp-III branches. Oh wait, the question says the pp-III branch stops. So what's the pp-III branch exactly?

I remember that the pp chain starts with two protons (protons are just hydrogen nuclei) fusing. In the pp-I branch, two protons fuse to form a deuterium nucleus, a positron, and a neutrino. But wait, that's actually the first step of the pp-I branch. Then, the deuterium can capture another proton to form tritium (that's pp-II?), or maybe that's the pp-I part. Alternatively, maybe I'm mixing things up.

Alternatively, the pp chain has different branches. The pp-I branch is when a proton captures a deuteron to form tritium, then another proton captures to become helium-4, and so on. The pp-II branch is when a proton captures a triton to form helium-4, and then other reactions happen. But I'm not too clear on the details.

Wait, the pp-III branch—maybe that's a different process. Oh right, another pathway: in the pp-III branch, two protons fuse to form a gamma-ray photon and a deuteron, but wait, no, that doesn't sound right. Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III branch involves the formation of a He-3 nucleus, which then combines with another He-3 to form carbon, and so on. Oh wait, maybe the pp-III branch is the part where He-3 is formed. Because I think the main pp chain has two main branches: one that goes via He-3 (pp-I) and one that goes via He-4 (pp-II or pp-III?), but I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, maybe the pp-III branch is the part where the two protons combine to form a diproton, which then emits two positrons and two neutrinos to become helium-4. Wait, no, diproton is a higher mass, so it can't be stable. Oh right, so the diproton (two protons fused) is unstable and emits two positrons and two neutrinos to become He-4. So that's the pp-III branch. Ok, so the pp-III process produces neutrinos as well.

So the question says that the pp-III branch suddenly stops. All other reactions remain the same. So the neutrinos from the pp-III branch are no longer being produced. But wait, the solar core has other reactions, like the CNO cycle, which doesn't involve protons in the same way. So the question is about the change in neutrino flux on Earth.

The neutrino flux from the Sun is measured in two energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). I need to find the ratio of their fluxes after the pp-III branch stops.

Wait, so normally, the flux is a combination of neutrinos from different sources. The main neutrinos are the electron neutrinos from the proton-proton chain and the CNO cycle. But in the pp-III branch, I think the neutrinos are lower energy compared to the CNO neutrinos.

Wait, let me think about the energies. The pp-III process, which produces He-4, emits two positrons and two neutrinos. Each neutrino has a certain energy. The typical energy for neutrinos from the pp-III branch is lower, around 0.5 MeV or so? Or maybe higher? Hmm.

In the standard solar model, the majority of the neutrinos come from the proton-proton chain, specifically the pp-I and pp-III branches. The CNO cycle produces higher energy neutrinos. Oh wait, no, wait. The CNO cycle produces higher energy neutrinos because the process involves heavier nuclei, so higher binding energies are involved. So the CNO neutrinos have higher energies than the pp neutrinos.

So, if the pp-III branch stops, which produces lower-energy neutrinos, then the flux in the lower energy bands would decrease, while the higher energy bands (like those from the CNO cycle) remain the same.

But the question is about two specific bands: 700-800 and 800-900 keV. Let's think about where the neutrinos from different sources fall.

The pp-III branch neutrinos: I think they're in the range of 0.5-1 MeV. Wait, 700 keV is 0.7 MeV. So 700-800 keV is 0.7-0.8 MeV, and 800-900 is 0.8-0.9 MeV. So the pp-III neutrinos are in the lower end, maybe around 0.5-0.8 MeV. The CNO neutrinos are higher, around 1-10 MeV or so.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again. The pp-III branch produces two neutrinos per event. The energy per neutrino would be about a third of the Q-value of the reaction. Wait, the Q-value for the diproton decay is about 2.458 MeV? Because each positron has about 0.511 MeV, but wait no, the diproton decay is:

diproton (pp) → He-4 + 2e+ + 2νe.

Wait, the diproton has a mass of approximately 2 * 1.007276 = ~2.014552 u. He-4 has a mass of ~4.002603 u. Wait, no, no, wait: diproton is two protons, each with ~1.007276 u, so 2.014552 u. He-4 is 4.002603 u. Wait, but that can't be right because diproton is lighter than He-4. Wait, wait, wait. He-4 has a mass of about 4.002603 u. Wait, two protons plus two positrons? No, because diproton is two protons, and when it decays, it emits two positrons and two neutrinos to become He-4. Wait, that can't be right because the diproton is not heavy enough. Wait, maybe I'm getting the reaction wrong.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is two protons fusing to form a deuterium and a positron and a neutrino. That's the first step of the pp chain, which is part of the pp-I branch. Then, the deuterium captures another proton to form tritium, which is the second step of the pp-I branch. Then, the tritium captures a proton to form He-4, emitting a positron and a neutrino. Alternatively, deuterium can capture an electron to become something else, but I'm getting a bit stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III branch is the process where two protons collide and emit a photon, then perhaps form a different intermediate. Wait, maybe the pp-III branch is the part where two protons combine to form a He-2 nucleus (a di-alpha?), but that's not possible. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the pp-III branch produces higher energy neutrinos compared to the other branches. Or maybe it's the opposite. Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III branch is the dominant source of the lower-energy neutrinos.

Alternatively, maybe the pp-III branch is the main source of neutrinos in the 0.5-1 MeV range. So if that's the case, and the pp-III branch stops, then the neutrino flux in the lower energy bands would drop significantly.

So, the question is about the ratio of flux in band 1 (700-800 keV) to band 2 (800-900 keV) after the pp-III branch stops.

If the pp-III branch is a source of neutrinos in band 1 (700-800 keV), then stopping it would reduce the flux in band 1. However, since band 2 is 800-900 keV, perhaps the neutrinos in this band are from different sources, maybe CNO or other branches that weren't affected.

Wait, but the CNO cycle produces higher energy neutrinos. For example, CNO neutrinos are typically in the 1-10 MeV range. So if that's the case, then the 800-900 keV band may not be significantly affected by the pp-III stopping. Hmm.

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Let me try to find the typical energy ranges of solar neutrinos.

I recall that the majority of solar neutrinos come from the proton-proton chain. The pp chain produces neutrinos with energies around 0.25-0.5 MeV. Wait, no, that can't be right because the question is about 700 keV and up. Oh wait, perhaps the neutrinos from the CNO cycle are higher energy.

Wait, let me think. The neutrinos from the CNO cycle are higher energy. The CNO cycle operates in regions of the Sun where the temperature is higher, so the neutrinos from that process have higher energies than those from the pp chain. So the CNO neutrinos would be in the higher energy bands, like 1 MeV and above.

But the bands in the question are 700-800 and 800-900 keV. So both are around 0.7-0.9 MeV. So, if the pp-III branch produces neutrinos in this range, and the CNO neutrinos are above, say, 1 MeV, then the 700-800 band would be affected by the pp-III stopping, but the 800-900 band may not be, as CNO neutrinos are higher.

Wait, but that's not quite right. Because 800 keV is 0.8 MeV. So maybe the pp-III neutrinos are around 0.5-1 MeV. So stopping the pp-III would reduce the flux in both bands, but perhaps band 1 is more affected because it's lower, and the pp-III contributes more to lower energies.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III neutrinos are the main contributors in the 700-800 keV band, and CNO neutrinos contribute more in the 800-900 keV band. Hmm.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the question again. The pp-III branch stops, so all its neutrinos stop. The CNO neutrinos are unaffected. So if the pp-III neutrinos were a major source in the lower energy band (700-800 keV), then the flux in band 1 would drop, but band 2 (800-900) would remain similar, assuming CNO contributes there. So the ratio Flux1/Flux2 would decrease.

But the problem is, what fraction of the neutrino flux in each band comes from pp-III versus other sources.

Wait, the pp-III neutrinos are lower energy than the CNO neutrinos. So if the CNO neutrinos are all above, say, 1 MeV, then the 700-800 band is dominated by the pp-III and maybe pp-I or other pp branches. So if pp-III stops, this band's flux would drop a lot, while the 800-900 band's flux remains mostly the same (assuming no pp-III contribution there). So the ratio (Flux1/Flux2) would be a small number.

Wait, but how much of the pp-III flux is in each band? Let me think.

The neutrinos from the pp-III branch have energies in a certain range. If most of them are around 0.4-0.6 MeV, then the 700-800 keV band (0.7-0.8 MeV) wouldn't be much affected. But if the pp-III neutrinos have higher energies, then a significant portion would be in band 1, and stopping them would reduce the flux in band 1 but not as much in band 2.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III neutrinos have a peak around 0.3-0.4 MeV, so the bands in the question are higher. So if the pp-III neutrinos are in lower energy bands, then the flux in 700-800 and 800-900 bands wouldn't be much affected. But that can't be, because the question is about the pp-III stopping, implying that these bands are affected.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III neutrinos are the main contributors to the 700-800 band, while the 800-900 band has both pp-III and CNO contributions. Wait, but if the CNO neutrinos are higher than 1 MeV, then they don't contribute to the 800-900 keV band.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck on the exact energy ranges. Let me try to find some approximate values.

From what I remember, the neutrinos from the proton-proton chain have energies around 0.25 MeV to about 1.0 MeV. The CNO neutrinos are higher, around 1-10 MeV. So the bands in the question are 0.7-0.9 MeV. So perhaps the neutrinos in these bands are a mix of pp and CNO sources, but mainly pp. So, if the pp-III branch stops, which is a major source of the pp neutrinos, the flux in both bands would decrease.

Wait, but if the pp-III neutrinos are a subset of the pp neutrinos, how much do they contribute to each band?

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III branch produces a significant fraction of the neutrinos in the 0.7-0.8 MeV range. So if the pp-III stops, the flux in band 1 (700-800) would drop by a significant amount, but the 800-900 band (band 2) might have less dependence on pp-III, or maybe similar. Or perhaps band 2 is more affected because it's higher energy.

Wait, perhaps the pp-III neutrinos have a higher energy than the pp-I and pp-II. So the pp-III contributes more to the higher energy bands within the pp neutrinos.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The pp-III branch produces two neutrinos per reaction. The energy of each neutrino is about 0.3 MeV? Or higher?

Wait, the reaction for the pp-III branch is 2 protons → He-4 + 2 positrons + 2 neutrinos. The Q-value for this reaction is the mass difference between the products and reactants.

The mass of He-4 is about 4.002603 u.

Each proton is about 1.007276 u. So two protons are 2.01455 u.

So the mass difference is 4.002603 - 2.01455 = 1.988053 u.

Wait, but wait, that's not right because the reaction is 2 protons → He-4 + 2 positrons. The positrons have negligible mass (like 0.0005486 u each). So the mass difference is He-4 and 2 positrons minus 2 protons.

So mass of He-4 + 2 positrons: 4.002603 + 2*(0.0005486) ≈ 4.003699 u.

Mass of 2 protons: 2.01455 u.

So the difference is 4.003699 - 2.01455 = 1.989149 u.

1 u is about 931.5 MeV/c². So the Q-value is 1.989149 u * 931.5 MeV/c²/u ≈ 1.989149 * 931.5 ≈ 1.855 * 10^3 MeV = 1855 MeV.

Wait, but that's the total energy released in the reaction. But 2 positrons are emitted, each about 0.511 MeV. So the energy for the two positrons is 1.022 MeV.

So the remaining energy is 1855 - 1.022 ≈ 1854 MeV. But wait, that's way too high because the neutrinos can't have such high energies. Wait, clearly I'm making a mistake here because the actual neutrino energies are much lower.

Wait a minute, maybe I'm calculating the wrong Q-value. Because the reaction is 2 protons → He-4 + 2 positrons + 2 neutrinos. Wait no, that's not correct. The actual reaction is diproton → He-4 + 2 e+ + 2 ν_e. The diproton is the two protons in a bound state.

Wait, the mass of the diproton is about 2.01477 u. The mass of He-4 is 4.002603 u. Each positron is 0.0005486 u.

So the reaction is:

diproton (2.01477 u) → He-4 (4.002603 u) + 2 e+ (2 * 0.0005486 u) + 2 ν_e.

So the mass on the right: 4.002603 + 2*(0.0005486) = 4.003699 u.

So the mass difference is 4.003699 - 2.01477 = 1.988929 u.

Convert that to energy: 1.988929 u * 931.5 MeV/u ≈ 1.988929 * 931.5 ≈ 1.856 * 10^3 MeV = 1856 MeV.

But this is the total energy released. The positrons take away 1.022 MeV (2 * 0.511). So the remaining energy is 1856 - 1.022 ≈ 1855 MeV.

But that's the total energy available for the two neutrinos. So each neutrino would take about 927.5 MeV on average. But that's way too high because solar neutrinos are detected with energies around 0.5 MeV or less. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, maybe the reaction is different. Alternatively, perhaps I'm confusing the pp-III branch with another process. Oh wait, perhaps the pp-III branch isn't the diproton decay but another process. Let me think.

Wait, maybe the pp-III branch is when a proton captures a deuteron to form a triton (tritium), which then captures another proton to form helium-4. Each step emits a neutrino. So each step of the pp chain produces a neutrino. The first step is proton + proton → deuterium + positron + neutrino. The second step is deuterium + proton → tritium + positron + neutrino. The third step is tritium + proton → helium-4 + positron + neutrino.

Wait, but the pp-III branch is the part where the tritium captures a proton to form He-4. So each of these steps emits a neutrino. The neutrinos from the pp chain have lower energies, around 0.2-0.5 MeV. So the neutrinos from the pp chain (including pp-III) are lower energy than those from the CNO cycle.

So if the pp-III branch stops, the solar neutrino flux in the lower energy bands will decrease. The bands in the question are 700-800 keV and 800-900 keV, which are 0.7-0.8 MeV and 0.8-0.9 MeV.

If the pp-III neutrinos are around 0.2-0.5 MeV, then the 700-800 band (0.7-0.8 MeV) wouldn't be much affected because those neutrinos are higher energy. Wait, but that can't be right because the question is about the pp-III stopping, implying it contributes to these bands.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III neutrinos are higher energy. Maybe they're around 0.6-0.8 MeV. So if the pp-III stops, the flux in band 1 (700-800 keV) which is 0.7-0.8 MeV would drop, while band 2 (0.8-0.9 MeV) might have other sources contributing.

Wait, but I'm stuck on the exact energy ranges. Let me think about the options. The question asks for the ratio Flux1/Flux2.

If pp-III neutrinos are the main source in band 1, then stopping them would cause Flux1 to drop, while Flux2 is mainly from CNO or other processes. So the ratio would decrease.

If the pp-III neutrinos are also a significant contributor to band 2, then both fluxes would drop, but maybe band 1 more than band 2. So the ratio would be less than 1.

Wait, but without knowing the exact energy spectrum, it's a bit hard. Let me think about the options given.

The options are:

A) 10.

B) 0.01 (1e-2).

C) 1.

D) 0.1 (1e-1).

So which is it? The ratio is flux1 over flux2. If pp-III is a big source for band 1, then if it stops, flux1 drops a lot, while flux2 is maybe 10 times higher because it's from CNO.

Alternatively, maybe the pp-III neutrinos have a broader spectrum, contributing to both bands but more to band 1.

Wait, but if the neutrinos from pp-III have energies around 0.5-0.8 MeV, then they would affect band 1 (0.7-0.8) and part of band 2 (0.8-0.9). So stopping pp-III would reduce both bands, but perhaps band 1 more than band 2.

But if the CNO neutrinos are in higher energy bands (say, 1-10 MeV), then they don't contribute to bands 1 and 2. So the flux in bands 1 and 2 would be almost entirely from the pp chain, which includes the pp-III branch.

So, if the pp-III branch stops, which is a major source of the pp neutrinos, then both bands would see a drop in flux. But perhaps the higher energy band (800-900 keV) has a smaller contribution from pp-III than the lower band (700-800), so the flux in band 1 drops more, making the ratio flux1/flux2 smaller.

Wait, but the question is the ratio after the pp-III branch stops. So the flux in band 1 would be without pp-III, and the same for band 2.

If the pp-III neutrinos contribute more to band 1 than band 2, then the ratio (flux1/flux2) would be lower than 1.

Alternatively, maybe the pp-III neutrinos contribute the same to both bands, but that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III neutrinos are in the lower part of the 0.7-0.8 MeV range, and band 2 (0.8-0.9) is less affected. So the flux1 would drop a lot, flux2 less so, leading to a lower ratio.

But without exact data, it's tricky. So, perhaps the best approach is to think that the pp-III neutrinos are the main contributors to band 1, and perhaps a smaller contributor to band 2.

So, if the pp-III stops, flux1 goes down a lot, while flux2 may not change as much, or may only have a small contribution from pp-III. So flux1/flux2 would be a small number, like 0.1 or 0.01.

But why? Let me think about the neutrino energy spectra. The pp neutrinos have a distribution that peaks at lower energies, with a tail extending into higher energies. The CNO neutrinos are much higher.

So, in the 700-800 keV band, most of the neutrinos are from the pp chain, including pp-III. In the 800-900 keV band, maybe a bit from pp-III and some from higher processes. But wait, perhaps the higher energy bands are dominated by CNO, but 0.8-0.9 MeV is still in the pp range.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III neutrinos are the main source for the 700-800 band, and the 800-900 band has other pp neutrinos and possibly some from other sources like the CNO.

Wait, but CNO neutrinos are higher than 1 MeV, so they don't contribute to the 800-900 band.

Hmm, but if the pp-III neutrinos are in the 0.7-0.8 MeV range, then after stopping, flux1 would drop, but flux2 (0.8-0.9) would also drop, but perhaps less so.

Wait, perhaps I should look at the relative contributions of the pp-III to each band.

Assume that the pp-III neutrinos are responsible for x% of the total neutrino flux in band 1 and y% in band 2.

If the pp-III stops, then the flux in band 1 becomes (1 - x) * original_flux1, and in band 2, (1 - y) * original_flux2.

But without knowing x and y, it's hard. If x > y, then (flux1)/(flux2) after stopping would be [(1-x)/(1-y)] times the original ratio.

But I don't know the original ratio.

Alternatively, perhaps the original ratio (before pp-III stops) is about 1, and after stopping, the ratio drops significantly.

But I'm not sure.

Another approach: the total solar neutrino flux is dominated by the pp chain, which contributes about 99% of the neutrinos, with the CNO contributing about 1%. So if the pp-III branch stops, which is a part of the pp chain, the total neutrino flux would decrease.

But the question is about the ratio of two bands. If the pp-III neutrinos are more in band 1 than in band 2, then the ratio would decrease.

So, for example, if band 1's flux is primarily from pp-III, and band 2 is more from pp-I or CNO (but CNO is higher), then stopping pp-III would cause band 1's flux to drop more than band 2's.

So the ratio flux1/flux2 would become smaller.

Assuming that, the ratio would be around 0.1 (option D) or 0.01 (option B).

But how much would each band be affected?

If the pp-III neutrinos are a major source for band 1 (say, 80% of the flux) and a minor source for band 2 (say, 10% of the flux), then after stopping, band 1's flux would drop to 20% of original, and band 2's to 90%. The ratio would be 20% / 90% ≈ 0.22, which is not exactly the options. Hmm.

Alternatively, if band 1 is 90% pp-III and band 2 is 10% pp-III, then after stopping, band 1 is 10% of original, band 2 is 90% of original. Ratio is 10/90 ≈ 0.11, which is option D (0.1).

Alternatively, if band 1 is 95% pp-III and band 2 is 5% pp-III, then after stopping, band 1 is 5%, band 2 is 95%. Ratio is 5/95 ≈ 0.052, which is approximately 0.05, closer to option B (0.01) but perhaps not exact.

But the options given don't include 0.05. The closest lower option is B (0.01) or D (0.1). So perhaps the correct answer is D) 0.1.

Wait, but another way to think: the flux from pp-III is the main contributor to the lower band but less so for the upper band. So if the pp-III stops, the lower band flux drops by a large factor, but the upper band's flux isn't as affected. So if before stopping, the ratio was 1, after stopping, the lower band has much less flux.

Wait, perhaps originally, the ratio is about 1. After stopping, band 1's flux drops by a factor of 10 (because it was mostly pp-III), while band 2's flux remains almost the same. So the new ratio is 1/10 = 0.1.

So the answer would be 0.1, option D.

The question involves determining the ratio of neutrino flux in two energy bands (700-800 keV and 800-900 keV) after the pp-III branch of the proton-proton chain in the Sun's core suddenly stops. The pp-III branch is a significant source of neutrinos, particularly at lower energies, while the CNO cycle produces higher-energy neutrinos. The key points of analysis are as follows:

1. **Energy Ranges of Neutrinos**:  
   - Neutrinos from the pp-III branch typically have energies in the range of 0.25–1.0 MeV.  
   - The CNO cycle produces neutrinos with much higher energies, generally above 1 MeV.  
   - The bands in question (700–800 keV and 800–900 keV, or 0.7–0.8 MeV and 0.8–0.9 MeV) overlap with the energy range of pp-III neutrinos and are less affected by CNO neutrinos.

2. **Impact of Stopping the pp-III Branch**:  
   - The pp-III branch is a major contributor to the neutrino flux in the 700–800 keV band. If it stops, the flux in this band will decrease significantly.  
   - The 800–900 keV band is less dependent on the pp-III branch, as it may still receive contributions from other parts of the pp chain or potentially higher-energy neutrinos (though CNO neutrinos are likely above 1 MeV and do not contribute to these bands).  

3. **Flux Ratio Before and After the pp-III Branch Stops**:  
   - Before the pp-III branch stops, the flux in both bands is dominated by pp-chain neutrinos, with the pp-III branch contributing more to the lower band (700–800 keV).  
   - After the pp-III branch stops, the flux in the 700–800 keV band drops significantly, while the flux in the 800–900 keV band is less affected. This results in a reduced ratio of flux in the 700–800 keV band to flux in the 800–900 keV band.

4. **Analysis of Options**:  
   - **A) 10**: This is incorrect because the flux in the 700–800 keV band decreases significantly after the pp-III branch stops, making this ratio too high.  
   - **B) 0.01 (10⁻²)**: This is too low. While the flux in the 700–800 keV band decreases, the flux in the 800–900 keV band does not drop as drastically, so the ratio is not this small.  
   - **C) 1**: This is incorrect because the flux ratio changes after the pp-III branch stops, and the ratio is no longer equal to 1.  
   - **D) 0.1 (10⁻¹)**: This is the most reasonable option. The flux in the 700–800 keV band decreases significantly due to the loss of pp-III neutrinos, while the flux in the 800–900 keV band is less affected, leading to a ratio of approximately 0.1.

Based on the analysis, the approximate ratio of the flux between the two bands after the pp-III branch stops is **0.1**. 

Answer: D
