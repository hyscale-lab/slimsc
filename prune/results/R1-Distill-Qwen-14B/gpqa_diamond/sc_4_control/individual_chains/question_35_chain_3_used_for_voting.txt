Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through the question again and try to understand what's being asked.

The problem is about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator, denoted as A_y. So, A_y is represented by a 2x2 matrix called Ay. The question gives me an equation: Ay(φ) = a(φ), where a is the eigenvalue and φ is the eigenfunction. 

They also say that Ay is equal to c multiplied by S, where c is h divided by 4π (so c = h/(4π)), and S is a 2x2 matrix. The first row of S is (0, -i), and the second row is (i, 0). 

The task is to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay and determine which of the given statements (A to D) is correct.

Hmm, I remember that for angular momentum operators, the eigenvalues relate to the quantum numbers. But since this is a 2x2 matrix, it's probably dealing with spin-1/2 particles, like electrons or muons. The muon is mentioned here, so that's consistent.

First, let me write out the matrix S. S is a 2x2 matrix:

Row 1: 0, -i
Row 2: i, 0

So, S looks like this:
[ 0   -i ]
[ i    0 ]

Now, Ay is c multiplied by S. So, c is h/(4π). Let me compute Ay:

Ay = c * S = (h/(4π)) * [ [0, -i], [i, 0] ]

Which gives Ay as:
[ 0    (-i h)/(4π) ]
[ (i h)/(4π)    0 ]

So, the matrix Ay is:

[ 0              (-i h)/(4π) ]
[ (i h)/(4π)      0          ]

Now, I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. To find the eigenvalues, I'll solve the characteristic equation: det(Ay - λ I) = 0.

Let me construct the matrix (Ay - λ I):

[ -λ          (-i h)/(4π)  ]
[ (i h)/(4π)  -λ           ]

The determinant is (-λ)(-λ) - [(-i h)/(4π)] * [(i h)/(4π)].

So det = λ² - [ (-i)(i) (h²)/(4π)^2 ]

Wait, let's compute the product of the off-diagonal elements. The product is [(-i h)/(4π)] * [(i h)/(4π)] = (-i)(i) * (h^2)/(4π)^2.

Simplify (-i)(i): (-i)(i) = -(i^2) = -( -1 ) = 1.

So the product is (1) * (h^2)/(16 π² ) = h²/(16 π² )

So the determinant equation becomes:

λ² - (h²/(16 π² )) = 0

Which simplifies to λ² = h²/(16 π² )

Taking square roots, λ = ± h/(4π) * (1/2) ??? Wait, wait, let me compute h^2/(16 π² ) is [ (h/(4π)) ]², because (h/(4π))² = h²/(16 π² ), yes.

So sqrt( λ² ) is ± h/(4π) * (1/2) ? Wait, no. Wait, sqrt( [h/(4π)]² ) is h/(4π), because sqrt is positive. Wait, no, the equation is λ² = (h/(4π))² * (1/4) ? Wait, no, wait let me recheck.

Wait, wait. Let me re-do the determinant calculation.

The determinant is λ² - [ (i h/(4π)) * (-i h/(4π)) ]

Wait, the product (i h/(4π)) * (-i h/(4π)) equals (i * -i) (h²)/(4π)^2.

i * (-i) = -i² = -(-1) = 1.

So [i * (-i)] = 1, so the product is (h²)/(16 π² )

So determinant is λ² - (h²)/(16 π² ) = 0 → λ² = h²/(16 π² )

So λ = ± h/(4π) * (1/2) ??? Wait, because h²/(16 π² ) = (h/(4π))² * (1/4). No, wait: (h/(4π))² is h²/(16 π² ), which matches the equation. So λ is ± h/(4π) * (1/2) ??? No, wait, λ is sqrt( h²/(16 π² ) ) → which is h/(4π) * (1/2) ? No, wait, sqrt( (h/(4π))² ) is h/(4π), right? Because sqrt(a²) is |a|, which for positive a is a.

Wait, no, wait the square of λ is (h/(4π))² * (1/4) ?

Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me compute the determinant again.

The determinant is [λ^2] - [ ( (-i h)/(4π) ) * ( i h/(4π) ) ].

The product is (-i h/(4π)) * (i h/(4π)) = (-i)(i) * (h^2)/(4π)^2.

(-i)(i) equals -i² = -(-1) = 1. So product is 1 * (h^2)/(16 π² )

So determinant equation is λ² - (h²/(16 π² )) = 0 → λ² = h²/(16 π² )

So λ = ± h/(4π) * (1/2) ?

Wait, no, because sqrt( h²/(16 π² ) ) is h/(4π).

Wait, yes. Because (h/(4π))² = h²/(16 π² ), so sqrt is h/(4π) → so λ is ± h/(4π) * 1/2? No, wait no, that's not right.

Wait, no, sqrt( h²/(16 π² ) ) is h/(4π). Because (h/(4 π))^2 = h²/(16 π²). So the square root is h/(4 π) and the eigenvalues are ± h/(4 π) multiplied by what?

Wait, no, the equation is λ² = [ h/(4 π) ]² * (1/4). No, no, wait, no. Wait, no, the product in the determinant is h²/(16 π² ), which is (h/(4 π))². So, λ² = (h/(4 π))² → λ = ± h/(4 π) * (1/2 )? Wait, no. Wait, no, because h^2/(16 π^2) is (h/(4 π))^2. So sqrt is h/(4 π). So eigenvalues are λ = ± h/(4 π) ?

Wait no, that can't be right. Because the matrix S is the Pauli Y matrix, and the eigenvalues of the Pauli matrices are ±1. Let me think about S.

Wait, S is:

[0  -i]
[i  0]

Which is similar to the Pauli Y matrix, which is usually written as:

(0  -i)
(i   0 )

So S is the Pauli Y matrix, right? Because the Pauli matrices have that form. So Y has eigenvalues ±1.

Wait, but the eigenvalues of Y are ±1.

Wait, but in this case, Ay is c * Y, where c = h/(4 π). So the eigenvalues of Ay would be c times the eigenvalues of Y.

So since Y eigenvalues are ±1, Ay's eigenvalues would be c * (±1) = ±c → ± h/(4 π).

So, the eigenvalues are ±h/(4 π).

So looking at the options. Option A says the imaginary parts are ±2πh and real parts are ±h/(4 π). Hmm, but the eigenvalues are real numbers here, right?

Wait, wait, let me think again. Are the eigenvalues of Ay real?

Wait, the matrix Ay is a 2x2 matrix. Let me write it again:

(0              (-i h)/(4π) )
( (i h)/(4π)     0 )

So, for a 2x2 matrix, the eigenvalues can be complex if it's not Hermitian. But is Ay Hermitian?

Wait, the intrinsic angular momentum operators are Hermitian, so their expectation values are real. So Ay must be Hermitian.

Let me check. The matrix Ay is:

Row 1: [0, (-i h)/(4π) ]

Row 2: [ (i h)/(4π), 0 ]

The conjugate transpose (Hermitian conjugate) would be:

Row 1: [0, (i h)/(4π) ]

Row 2: [ (-i h)/(4π), 0 ]

Which is not the same as Ay. So Ay is not Hermitian. Hmm, that's odd. Because for angular momentum components, the operators should be Hermitian, as they are observables. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, wait, the intrinsic angular momentum operator should be represented as J_y. Wait, but here it's given as A_y. So perhaps A is the orbital angular momentum? No, the question says intrinsic, so it's spin.

Wait, let me think. The Pauli matrices Y is Hermitian. Because Y† = Y.

Wait, S is given as:

(0  -i)
(i 0 )

Wait, let me compute S†, the conjugate transpose.

S† is:

(0   i)
(-i 0 )

Which is not equal to S, because S has (i, 0) in the second row. So S is not Hermitian.

Wait, that's confusing. Because the Pauli Y matrix is Hermitian. Wait, perhaps I got the matrix wrong.

Wait, the Pauli Y matrix is usually written as:

[ 0  -i ]
[ i   0 ]

Which is the same as S. So S is Y, which is Hermitian because Y† = Y.

Wait, let me compute S†.

S is:

Row 1: 0, -i

Row 2: i, 0

So S† is:

Row 1: 0, i

Row 2: -i, 0

Which is different from S. So S is not equal to its conjugate transpose. So S is not Hermitian.

Wait, that can't be right because the Pauli matrices are Hermitian. Oh wait, maybe I wrote S incorrectly. Let me double-check the Pauli Y matrix.

Wait, the Pauli matrices are:

X = [[0,1],[1,0]]

Y = [[0, -i],[i, 0]]

Z = [[1,0],[0,-1]]

So Y is indeed:

[0  -i]
[i  0]

Which is the same as S.

So Y is Hermitian because Y† = Y.

Wait, let me compute Y†:

Y† is [[0, i], [-i, 0]]

Which isn't the same as Y. Because Y is [[0, -i],[i, 0]]

Wait, so Y is not Hermitian? That can't be right. Because Pauli matrices are Hermitian. Oh wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the transpose.

Wait, Y is:

Row 1: 0, -i

Row 2: i, 0

So Y† is:

Column 1 becomes row 2: (i, 0)

Column 2 becomes row 1: (-i, 0 )

Wait, no. Let me recompute. Take each element:

Y[1,1] = 0 → Y†[1,1] = 0.

Y[1,2] = -i → Y†[2,1] = conjugate(-i) = i.

Y[2,1] = i → Y†[1,2] = conjugate(i) = -i.

Y[2,2] = 0 → Y†[2,2] = 0.

So Y† is:

Row 1: 0, -i

Row 2: i, 0

Which is the same as Y. So Y is Hermitian.

Ah, okay, then I made a mistake earlier. So S is Hermitian, so Ay is c * S, with c real. So Ay is Hermitian. So Ay has real eigenvalues.

So, the eigenvalues of Ay would be real numbers. So the eigenvalues are ± c * 1, because Y has eigenvalues ±1.

So, eigenvalues are ± c → c is h/(4 π), so a = ± h/(4 π).

So, the eigenvalues are ± h/(4 π).

Wait, but looking back, when I calculated the determinant, I got λ² = [h/(4 π)]² * (1/4) ?

Wait, no, earlier I thought that the determinant equation was λ² - (h^2)/(16 π^2) = 0 → λ = ± h/(4 π).

Wait, but wait, the determinant when I compute it, I get λ² - (h^2)/(16 π^2) =0 → λ = ± h/(4 π) * (1/2) ?

Wait, no, no, wait, earlier calculation:

det = λ² - [ ( (-i h)/(4π) ) * (i h/(4π) ) ]

= λ² - [ (-i * i) * (h²)/(4π)^2 ]

= λ² - [ (1) * (h²)/(16 π²) )

So λ² = h²/(16 π² )

So λ = sqrt( h²/(16 π² ) ) = h/(4 π )

So the eigenvalues are ± h/(4 π )

So a is ± h/(4 π )

So looking at the options:

Option A says the imaginary parts are ±2πh, and real parts are ±h/(4π). But the eigenvalues are real, so the imaginary part is zero. So A is incorrect.

Option B: imaginary parts ±1/2, real parts ±1. That doesn't match. Our a is h/(4π) times ±1. So their real parts are ± h/(4π), not ±1.

Option C: The eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az.

Hmm. Well, A² is the square of the angular momentum. For spin-1/2 particles, A² would have eigenvalues (1/2)(1/2 +1) ħ². But wait, in this case, the operator is A_y, which is a component, not the total angular momentum.

Wait, but the question is about whether the eigenfunctions of A_y are also eigenfunctions of A². I think that for any angular momentum component, the eigenfunctions of that component are not eigenfunctions of the square of the total angular momentum, unless it's the maximum state.

Wait, but wait, actually, in quantum mechanics, the total angular momentum J² commutes with each component J_x, J_y, J_z. So, their eigenfunctions (eigenstates) are common. But wait, that's when you're considering the simultaneous eigenstates of J² and J_z, for example.

But in this case, the question is about A_y's eigenfunctions being eigenfunctions of A². So, if a state is an eigenstate of A_y, is it also an eigenstate of A²?

Wait, A² would be (A_x^2 + A_y^2 + A_z^2), but since A is spin, then A² = s(s+1)ħ^2, where s is 1/2. So A² is a constant for all states. So any state is an eigenstate of A².

Wait, but in this case, the operator Ay is a component. So if a state is an eigenstate of Ay, then it's also an eigenstate of A². Because A² is a constant operator. So, the eigenfunctions of Ay are also eigenfunctions of A².

Wait, but what about whether they are eigenfunctions of Az? I think not. Because if a state is an eigenstate of Ay, it's not an eigenstate of Az, unless it's a simultaneous eigenstate, which is only possible for the states that are eigenstates of both, which would only happen if the states are along a particular direction, but generally, for spin-1/2, eigenstates of Ay are superpositions of eigenstates of Az.

So, option C says the eigenfunctions of Ay can be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. That sounds correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above. Hmm, not sure what that means. Basis functions for Ay? Well, any 2x2 matrix has basis vectors. So the eigenvectors of Ay would form a basis for the space. So D says that the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of Ay. I'm not entirely sure about this statement, but I think it's more about whether the eigenvectors form a basis. Since the matrix is 2x2 and has two eigenvalues (assuming they are distinct), the eigenvectors would form a basis. So D could be correct, but I'm not certain.

So, let me look back at the options. Option C seems correct because the eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenfunctions of A² (since A² is a constant, so any state is its eigenstate), but not necessarily eigenstates of Az because they are eigenstates of a different component.

Wait, but in the problem statement, A is the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator. So the operator is Ay. So, the eigenstates of Ay are not eigenstates of Az unless they are the same, which they aren't because the operators don't commute.

So, option C is correct.

Alternatively, let me think about the statements again. 

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.

Wait, any operator's eigenvectors form a basis, as long as they are linearly independent. Since Ay is a 2x2 matrix with two eigenvalues, as long as they are distinct, the eigenvectors will form a basis. So, yes, the eigenfunctions φ form a basis for the space. So option D says that, so it's correct. Hmm, but earlier I thought C was correct. So which is correct?

Wait, the question asks which statement is correct during the calculation. So I need to see which options are correct.

Option C: The eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay.

Wait, both could be correct. Let me think again.

Wait, the question is about which statement is correct during the calculation. So, perhaps I should check each option.

Starting with option C: eigenfunctions of Ay are also eigenfunctions of A²? Because A² is the square of the total angular momentum, which is s(s+1) ℏ². For a spin-1/2 particle, that's (3/4) ℏ². So any eigenstate of Ay is also an eigenstate of A² because A² is a scalar. So C is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix Ay. Well, the matrix representation is done in a particular basis, but the eigenvectors of Ay form a basis for the space. So the eigenvectors are a basis for the operator's matrix. So D is correct.

Wait, but in a 2x2 matrix, the eigenvectors (if they are linearly independent) form a basis. So D is correct.

Hmm, but let's think about the options. The question is which statements are correct during the calculation. So perhaps both C and D could be correct.

But looking at the options, perhaps only one is correct.

Wait, looking back at the options:

Option C: The eigenfunction of the operator Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A², but not of the Z-component, Az. 

So it's saying that the eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenfunctions of A² but not Az. That's correct because A² commutes with Ay, so if a state is an eigenstate of Ay, it is also an eigenstate of A². But since Ay and Az don't commute, the eigenfunctions of Ay are not eigenfunctions of Az. So C is correct.

Option D says that the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. I think this is correct as well because the eigenvectors form a basis for the space. So why would the option be correct?

Hmm, but the question is which statement is correct during the calculation. Let me reevaluate the options.

Wait, the question is about the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. So when calculating the eigenvalues, I found they're ±h/(4π). Then, when finding the eigenvectors, perhaps I can see which statements hold.

But looking at the options again, option D says that the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the operator Ay. Well, any operator's eigenfunctions (if they form a basis) are the basis functions. So D is correct. But the question is which statement is correct during the calculation. So perhaps both C and D are correct, but I'm only supposed to choose one.

Wait, looking at the options, let's see:

Option A: Imaginary parts ±2πh, real ±h/(4π). No, eigenvalues are real, so A is incorrect.

Option B: Real parts ±1, imaginary ±1/2. Doesn't fit, so B is incorrect.

Option C: Eigenfunctions are eigenfunctions of A², but not Az. Correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix. Correct.

But perhaps the correct answer is C or D.

Wait, the question is which statement is correct during the calculation. So both C and D could be correct. But perhaps only one is correct.

Wait, let me think again. Option D is stating that the eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. The matrix operator is 2x2, so its eigenvectors (if they are distinct and non-degenerate) would form a basis. So yes, the eigenfunctions are indeed the basis functions of the operator. So D is correct.

But in the context of the problem, perhaps the statement in option C is correct because the eigenvectors of Ay are eigenfunctions of A², which is the square of the total angular momentum, but not of Az.

Wait, but wait: the square of the component Ay is different from the square of the total angular momentum. Oh no, no, wait, A² is the square of the total angular momentum, not the component. So, the statement in option C says that the eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², which is true because A² is a constant, so any state is an eigenstate of A². But the eigenfunctions of Ay are not eigenfunctions of Az because Ay and Az don't commute. So option C is correct.

So, the correct statements are C and D. But looking at the options, which of the four is correct.

Wait, perhaps I have to read the options again.

Option C: The eigenfunction of the operator Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A^2, but not of the Z-component, Az.

Yes, because A^2 is a scalar (same for all states), so any state that is an eigenfunction of Ay is also an eigenfunction of A^2. But it's not an eigenfunction of Az because Ay and Az don't commute, so their eigenfunctions are different.

So option C is correct.

Option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. Which is correct, because the eigenvectors form a basis. But the way the option is phrased is a bit ambiguous. The matrix operator's basis is the standard basis, but the eigenvectors may form a different basis. So perhaps the statement is correct. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is C.

Wait, but looking at the possible answers given, the correct eigenvalues are ±h/(4π), which are real. So option A is wrong because it suggests imaginary parts, which don't exist.

Option B is also wrong.

So, the correct statements are either C or D.

Now, the question is which statement is correct during the calculation. The question asks which statement I should consider correct during the calculation.

So, in the calculation, when you compute the eigenvalues, you find that the eigenvalues are real and equal to ±h/(4π). So the imaginary parts are zero, so options A and B are incorrect.

So, the correct options are either C or D.

I think I'll go with option C being correct because the eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenfunctions of A² (since A² is a constant, any state is an eigenstate) but not of Az. So option C is correct.

Alternatively, option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. Which is true, because the eigenvectors form a basis. So D is correct.

But I'm a bit confused because both could be correct. But the options don't have an 'both C and D' choice. So perhaps I should pick the correct one.

Wait, the question is only asking which statement is correct. So, perhaps the correct answer is C.

Wait, but maybe I should think about the eigenvectors. Let me compute them.

To find the eigenvectors, I'll solve (Ay - λ I) v = 0 for each λ.

For λ = h/(4π):

Ay - (h/(4π)) I = 

[ -h/(4π)    (-i h)/(4π) ]
[ (i h)/(4π)  -h/(4π) ]

So the matrix is:

Row 1: -h/(4π), (-i h)/(4π)

Row 2: (i h)/(4π), -h/(4π)

We can write the equations:

(-h/(4π)) v1 + (-i h/(4π)) v2 = 0.

Multiply both sides by 4π/h:

- v1 - i v2 = 0 → v1 = -i v2.

So the eigenvector is proportional to [ -i, 1 ]^T.

Similarly, for λ = -h/(4π):

Ay - (-h/(4π)) I = 

[ h/(4π)     (-i h)/(4π) ]
[ (i h)/(4π)  h/(4π) ]

Equation:

(h/(4π)) v1 + (-i h)/(4π) v2 =0 → v1 = i v2.

So the eigenvectors are [i, 1]^T.

So, the eigenfunctions are proportional to [ -i, 1 ]^T and [i, 1 ]^T.

Now, looking at option C: eigenfunctions of Ay can be eigenfunctions of A² (since A² is s(s+1) ħ², which is a constant) but not of Az.

So, option C is correct.

Option D is also correct because the eigenvectors form a basis.

But perhaps the correct answer is C, because the question's options list it as correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is D.

Wait, but the question says which statement is correct during the calculation of eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

So, perhaps in the process, you'd find that the eigenfunctions form a basis. So, option D is correct.

But I'm getting a bit stuck.

Wait, looking at the options again, option D says that the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. So, the matrix Ay is represented in the standard basis. The eigenvectors form another basis. So, the statement in option D is correct because the eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) form a basis for the space, meaning they are the basis functions of the operator.

So, both C and D seem correct. But which one is correct according to the options? Let me read the options again.

Option C: The eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of the Z-component, Az.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.

So, which of these is correct?

Well, during the calculation, you find that the eigenfunctions form a basis for the space, so D is correct. But the eigenfunctions are also eigenfunctions of A², so C is correct.

But looking at the options, only one can be correct.

Wait, perhaps in the problem, the answer is not D because the matrix operator's basis is not necessarily the eigenbasis. The standard basis is the computational basis, not necessarily the eigenbasis.

Wait, the matrix's basis is the standard basis (like |+x>, |+y> etc.), but if the eigenfunctions are in a different basis, then they are another basis. So, the eigenfunctions are indeed the basis functions for the matrix operator, but in a different basis.

So, perhaps option D is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is C because the question is about the properties of the eigenfunctions, not about their basis.

Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing. Let me think about the question again.

The question is: which statement is correct during the calculation of eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay.

So, in the process of calculation, which statement is correct.

Option C is correct because the eigenfunctions are eigenfunctions of A² but not Az.

Option D is correct because the eigenfunctions form a basis.

But the options give only one correct choice. So, perhaps only C is correct.

Wait, looking back, when the problem states that the operator Ay is a 2x2 matrix, and the eigenfunctions form a basis, so D is correct.

But the answer options are single choice, so looking at the initial options, which one is correct.

Looking again, the correct eigenvalues are ±h/(4π). So only options C or D are correct.

But I'm not entirely certain, but I think the correct answer is C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves calculating the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator, \( A_y \), represented by a \( 2 \times 2 \) matrix. The matrix \( A_y \) is given as \( A_y = c \cdot S \), where \( c = \frac{h}{4\pi} \) and \( S \) is the matrix:

\[
S = \begin{bmatrix} 
0 & -i \\ 
i & 0 
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 1: Eigenvalues of \( A_y \)
The eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are determined by solving the characteristic equation \( \det(A_y - \lambda I) = 0 \). Substituting \( A_y = c \cdot S \), the matrix \( A_y \) becomes:

\[
A_y = \frac{h}{4\pi} \begin{bmatrix} 
0 & -i \\ 
i & 0 
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

The characteristic equation is:

\[
\det \begin{bmatrix} 
-\lambda & -\frac{i h}{4\pi} \\ 
\frac{i h}{4\pi} & -\lambda 
\end{bmatrix} = 0.
\]

Expanding the determinant:

\[
\lambda^2 - \left(-\frac{i h}{4\pi}\right) \left(\frac{i h}{4\pi}\right) = 0.
\]

Simplifying the off-diagonal product:

\[
\left(-\frac{i h}{4\pi}\right) \left(\frac{i h}{4\pi}\right) = \frac{h^2}{16\pi^2}.
\]

Thus, the characteristic equation becomes:

\[
\lambda^2 - \frac{h^2}{16\pi^2} = 0 \implies \lambda = \pm \frac{h}{4\pi}.
\]

The eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are therefore \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \), which are real numbers.

### Step 2: Eigenvectors of \( A_y \)
For \( \lambda = \frac{h}{4\pi} \), solving \( (A_y - \lambda I)v = 0 \) gives the eigenvector proportional to \( \begin{bmatrix} -i \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \). For \( \lambda = -\frac{h}{4\pi} \), the eigenvector is proportional to \( \begin{bmatrix} i \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \).

### Step 3: Analysis of Options
- **Option A**: The eigenvalues are \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \), which are real. The imaginary parts of the eigenvalues are zero, so this option is incorrect.

- **Option B**: The eigenvalues are \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \), not \( \pm 1 \) or \( \pm \frac{1}{2} \). This option is incorrect.

- **Option C**: The eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) can also be eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \) because \( A^2 \) is a constant operator (related to the total angular momentum squared). However, the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are not eigenfunctions of \( A_z \), as \( A_y \) and \( A_z \) do not commute. This option is correct.

- **Option D**: The eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) form a basis for the \( 2 \times 2 \) space, as they are linearly independent and span the space. This option is also correct.

### Step 4: Final Decision
Both options C and D are correct, but the question asks for the correct statement during the calculation. Option C is more directly relevant to the properties of the eigenfunctions during the calculation, particularly their relationship to \( A^2 \) and \( A_z \). Therefore, the best answer is:

**Answer: C**
