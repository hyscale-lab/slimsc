Alright, I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. So the question is about finding the uncertainty in P_z given that the system is in an eigenstate of P_x with a specific eigenvalue. Hmm, okay, I remember that the uncertainty principle relates the variance of an operator to the expectation of its square minus the square of its expectation. So I need to compute ΔP_z, which is the square root of <P_z²> minus <P_z> squared.

Wait, but the system is in an eigenstate of P_x. Since P_x and P_z don't commute, I can't be certain of both their values simultaneously, which is why we're looking for the uncertainty here.

First, let's recap the given information. The operator P_x has a matrix form with rows:
Row 1: (0, ħ/√2, 0)
Row 2: (ħ/√2, 0, ħ/√2)
Row 3: (0, ħ/√2, 0)
Similarly, P_y and P_z have their own matrices. The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z, which I think means that the states are expressed in the z-basis. So the given state is a column vector (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2), and it's an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ.

Wait, but the state's components are given in the z-basis. So I can represent this state as |ψ> = (-1/2)|z=+ħ> + (1/√2)|z=0> + (-1/2)|z=-ħ>.

Now, to find the uncertainty in P_z, I need to compute <P_z> and <P_z²>, then take the square root of the variance. 

So, let's write down the matrix for P_z. It's given as:
Row 1: ħ, 0, 0
Row 2: 0, 0, 0
Row 3: 0, 0, -ħ

So P_z is a diagonal matrix with elements ħ, 0, -ħ along the diagonal.

First, let's compute <P_z>. The expectation value is ψ† P_z ψ.

The state vector is a column vector ψ = [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ]^T.

So ψ† is [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ].

Multiplying ψ† with P_z gives a row vector which is the product of ψ† and P_z.

Wait, no. Actually, <P_z> is the sum over the basis of ψ_i* P_z_ii ψ_i, because P_z is diagonal. So each element of P_z is just the eigenvalue for each basis state. So the first component is (-1/2)^2 * ħ. Because ψ_1 is -1/2, and the first diagonal element of P_z is ħ. Similarly for ψ_3, which is -1/2, and P_z33 is -ħ.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think: The expectation value of P_z is the sum of |ψ_i|^2 * P_z_ii.

So ψ has three components: ψ1 = -1/2, ψ2 = 1/√2, ψ3 = -1/2.

So |ψ1|^2 is (1/2)^2 = 1/4. Wait no, |ψ1| is the absolute value squared. So |ψ1|^2 is ( (-1/2) )² = 1/4.

Similarly, |ψ2|^2 is (1/√2 )² = 1/2.

|ψ3|^2 is ( (-1/2) )² = 1/4.

The diagonal elements of P_z are ħ, 0, -ħ. So:

<P_z> = |ψ1|² * ħ + |ψ2|² * 0 + |ψ3|² * (-ħ)
= (1/4) * ħ + (1/2)*0 + (1/4)*(-ħ)
= (ħ/4) - (ħ/4) = 0.

Hmm, that's interesting. So the expectation value of P_z is zero.

Now, what about <P_z²>? Since P_z² is just each diagonal element squared. So:

P_z² has diagonal elements (ħ)^2, 0, (-ħ)^2. So P_z² is diagonal with [ ħ², 0, ħ² ].

So <P_z²> is the sum of |ψ_i|^2 * (P_z^ii)^2.

So again:

= |ψ1|² * ħ² + |ψ2|² * 0 + |ψ3|² * ħ²
= (1/4) * ħ² + (1/2)*0 + (1/4)* ħ²
= (ħ²/4 + ħ²/4) = ħ²/2.

So the variance is <P_z²> - <P_z>² = (ħ²/2) - (0)^2 = ħ²/2.

The uncertainty ΔP_z is the square root of the variance, so sqrt( ħ²/2 ) = ħ / sqrt(2).

Looking at the options, that's option B) ħ/√2.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because I might have made a mistake. Let me recompute <P_z> again. 

<P_z> = (1/4) ħ + 0 + (1/4)(-ħ) = (ħ/4 - ħ/4) = 0. That's correct.

And <P_z²> is (1/4 + 1/4 ) ħ² = (1/2) ħ², so sqrt(1/2 ħ²) is ħ / sqrt(2). So yes, option B.

But wait, another approach: The state is expressed in the P_z basis, so the expectation of P_z is straightforward. Since the state is a combination of |+>, |0>, and |->, each with their own P_z eigenvalues. So the expectation is the sum of |c_i|² * eigenvalue. Which is exactly what I did.

So the answer should be option B.

To determine the uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ of the operator $P_z$, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

### Step 1: Compute $\langle P_z \rangle$
The given state is expressed as a column vector in the $P_z$ basis:
\[
|\psi\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{1}{2} \\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ -\frac{1}{2} \end{bmatrix}.
\]
The operator $P_z$ is diagonal with eigenvalues $\hbar$, $0$, and $-\hbar$ along the diagonal. The expectation value $\langle P_z \rangle$ is computed as:
\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \sum_i |\psi_i|^2 \cdot P_z^{ii}.
\]
The probabilities $|\psi_i|^2$ are:
\[
|\psi_1|^2 = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}, \quad |\psi_2|^2 = \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{2}, \quad |\psi_3|^2 = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}.
\]
Thus:
\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 0 + \frac{1}{4} \cdot (-\hbar) = \frac{\hbar}{4} - \frac{\hbar}{4} = 0.
\]

### Step 2: Compute $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$
The operator $P_z^2$ is also diagonal, with eigenvalues $\hbar^2$, $0$, and $\hbar^2$. The expectation value $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$ is:
\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \sum_i |\psi_i|^2 \cdot (P_z^{ii})^2.
\]
Using the same probabilities $|\psi_i|^2$:
\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar^2 + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 0 + \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar^2 = \frac{\hbar^2}{4} + \frac{\hbar^2}{4} = \frac{\hbar^2}{2}.
\]

### Step 3: Compute the Uncertainty $\Delta P_z$
The variance is:
\[
\text{Var}(P_z) = \langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2 = \frac{\hbar^2}{2} - 0^2 = \frac{\hbar^2}{2}.
\]
The uncertainty is the square root of the variance:
\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\text{Var}(P_z)} = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar^2}{2}} = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ is $\frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}$, which corresponds to option **B**.
