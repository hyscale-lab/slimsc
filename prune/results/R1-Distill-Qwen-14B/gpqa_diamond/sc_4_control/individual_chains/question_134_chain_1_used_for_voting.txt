Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me. Hmm, let's see what it's about. Oh right, it's about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when some acids and a base are mixed. Alright, I remember that neutralization reactions involve acids and bases reacting to form water and a salt. And enthalpy change is the heat released or absorbed during the reaction.

The problem gives me three solutions: HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2. Wait, but when you mix them together, I need to figure out what reacts with what. Let me list out their concentrations and volumes first.

So, for HCl: 500 mL of 0.2 M. HCl is a strong acid, so it'll dissociate completely. Each mole of HCl gives one mole of H+ ions. So the number of moles is... 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 moles of HCl. So H+ from HCl is 0.1 moles.

Then H2SO4: 300 mL of 0.3 M. H2SO4 is a strong acid too, but wait, it's a diprotic acid. Each molecule can donate two H+ ions. So the moles are 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 moles. Since each mole gives 2 H+, that's 0.18 moles of H+.

Ba(OH)2: 200 mL of 0.5 M. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. Each mole provides two OH- ions because the formula is Ba(OH)2, so it dissociates into Ba²+ and 2 OH- ions. So moles of Ba(OH)2 is 0.5 M * 0.2 L = 0.1 moles. So OH- ions are 0.2 moles.

Now, when these are mixed, the H+ ions from the acids will react with the OH- ions from the base. The neutralization reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O. The enthalpy change for this is usually about -57.2 kJ per mole of H2O formed, but wait, I should remember if that's per mole of H+ or per mole of reaction. Oh right, the enthalpy of neutralization is per mole of H+ reacting with OH-.

So first, I need to find out how much H+ and OH- are present in total.

Total H+ from HCl and H2SO4: 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 moles.

Total OH- from Ba(OH)2: 0.2 moles.

Wait, but OH- is 0.2 moles and H+ is 0.28 moles. So which is the limiting reagent? The OH- will run out first because 0.2 is less than 0.28. So all the OH- will react, and some H+ will be left over.

So the reaction will consume 0.2 moles of H+ and 0.2 moles of OH-.

Each mole of H+ neutralized releases 57.2 kJ (since it's exothermic, the enthalpy is negative). So 0.2 moles would release 0.2 * 57.2 = 11.44 kJ. But wait, wait. Wait, the options are in kcal and kJ. Let me check the units. Oh, some options are in kcal, others in kJ. I need to be careful.

Wait, 1 calorie is about 4.184 joules. 1 kcal is 4.184 kJ. So 57.2 kJ is about 13.66 kcal (since 57.2 / 4.184 ≈ 13.66). Wait, no, wait. Wait, 57.2 kJ is how many kcal? Because 1 kcal is 4.184 kJ. So 57.2 kJ divided by 4.184 is approximately 13.66 kcal per mole of H+.

So if 0.2 moles of H+ react, the enthalpy change is 0.2 * 13.66 ≈ 2.732 kcal. But wait, the problem is asking for the enthalpy of neutralization, which is the heat released when one mole of H+ reacts. So the reaction here is 0.2 moles reacting, so the total would be 0.2 * 57.2 kJ = 11.44 kJ. Wait, but the question is about the enthalpy of neutralization for the reaction, not the total heat. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused here.

Wait, no. Wait, the problem is to calculate the enthalpy change when mixing these solutions. So the neutralization process will occur as much as possible. The limiting reagent is OH- (0.2 moles). So the reaction will produce 0.2 moles of water, releasing 0.2 * 57.2 kJ = 11.44 kJ. But the options have B as -11.42 kcal. Oh wait, wait. Maybe I should calculate in kcal.

Wait, 57.2 kJ per mole is equal to 57.2 / 4.184 ≈ 13.66 kcal per mole. So 0.2 moles would give 0.2 * 13.66 = 2.732 kcal. But that's not matching any option except option A, which is -2.72 kcal. But wait, the calculation gives approximately -2.732 kcal, which is close to -2.72 kcal. So that would be option A.

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the way I'm calculating the H+ and OH-.

Wait, the H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, but in solution, does it dissociate completely for both protons? H2SO4 is a strong acid, but the first dissociation is complete, the second might not be as strong. Wait, no, H2SO4 is a strong acid in its first dissociation, but the second (HSO4- → H+ + SO4^2-) is weaker. Wait, in a concentrated solution, the second dissociation may not be complete. But wait, in this problem, are we to assume complete dissociation for both H+ from H2SO4? The problem states that H2SO4 is 0.3 M, but when it's in solution, does it contribute two H+ per molecule?

Wait, I think in the context of neutralization reactions, especially when dealing with strong acids and strong bases, we often assume that each H2SO4 contributes 2 H+ ions. So in this calculation, I think I should go with that.

So, going back. HCl: 0.1 moles H+.

H2SO4: 0.09 moles of H2SO4, each gives 2 H+. So 0.18 moles H+.

Total H+ = 0.28.

Ba(OH)2: 0.1 moles gives 0.2 moles OH-.

So, H+ is in excess. So 0.2 moles of OH- will react with 0.2 moles of H+.

So the neutralization reaction produces 0.2 moles of H2O.

The enthalpy change is 0.2 * 57.2 kJ = 11.44 kJ. But wait, the options have B as -11.42 kcal. Hmm.

Wait, 57.2 kJ is approximately 13.66 kcal. So 0.2 moles would be 0.2 *13.66 ≈ 2.73 kcal. But that's not matching option B. Alternatively, I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the calorie and kilojoule units. Let me think. The enthalpy of neutralization is usually given as about -57.2 kJ per mole of H+ (or per mole H2O, since each H+ gives one H2O). So each mole of H+ contributes -57.2 kJ.

So 0.2 moles give -11.44 kJ. But the options have B) -11.42 kcal and D) -16.0 kJ.

Wait, but 11.44 kJ is close to 11.42 kcal? No, because 11.44 kJ is about 2.738 kcal (divided by 4.184). So that would match option A (-2.72 kcal), but option B is much bigger.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of moles.

Let me recalculate the moles.

HCl: 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 moles HCl → 0.1 H+.

H2SO4: 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 moles H2SO4 → 0.18 moles H+.

Ba(OH)2: 0.5 M *0.2 L = 0.1 moles → 0.2 moles OH-.

Total H+ is 0.28, OH- is 0.2.

So OH- is limiting. So 0.2 moles of H+ and OH- react.

Enthalpy change = 0.2 * (-57.2 kJ) = -11.44 kJ.

So how much is that in kcal? -11.44 kJ / 4.184 ≈ -2.73 kcal. So that's approximately -2.73 kcal, which matches option A (-2.72 kcal). So option A is the correct answer.

Wait, but another thought: what if the H2SO4 doesn't completely dissociate? Would that change the calculation? Because H2SO4 is a strong acid in the first dissociation, but the second (HSO4- to SO4^2-) may not be complete. So in 0.3 M H2SO4, the first H+ is fully released, but the second may not be. So H+ from H2SO4 would only be 0.09 *1 (from H2SO4) + 0.09 * x, where x is the degree of dissociation of HSO4-.

But wait, HSO4- is a weak acid. So in a solution of 0.3 M H2SO4, the first H+ is fully released, giving 0.09 M H+ from H2SO4, but the second H+ comes from HSO4- dissociation. However, in a 0.3 M solution, the HSO4- may not fully dissociate. But, without the exact Ka value, it's hard to calculate. However, in most school problems, when H2SO4 is in a solution, it's assumed that both H+ are available. So I think the initial approach is correct.

Alternatively, if only the first H+ is considered, then H2SO4 would contribute 0.09 moles of H+ (since each H2SO4 gives one H+ initially, and the rest would be HSO4^- ions which may not dissociate fully). But that would change the total H+.

Wait, if H2SO4 is 0.3 M, but only the first H+ is considered, then H+ from H2SO4 is 0.09 moles, same as HCl's 0.1. So total H+ would be 0.19, which is 0.19. Then OH- is 0.2 moles. So in that case, the H+ is 0.19, which is less than OH- 0.2. So OH- would be in excess, and H+ is limiting. So 0.19 moles would react, releasing 0.19 *57.2 kJ ≈ 10.868 kJ, which is about -10.87 kJ. But none of the options match that.

Wait, but the options don't have that. So perhaps the assumption is that H2SO4 contributes two H+ per mole.

Alternatively, perhaps the calculation is done in terms of moles of H+ and OH- regardless of the source, and the limiting reagent is determined.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the neutralization in terms of equivalents.

HCl: 0.1 moles H+.

H2SO4: 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 equivalents H+.

Ba(OH)2: 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 equivalents OH-.

So total equivalents H+ = 0.28, OH- = 0.2. So OH- is limiting. So all 0.2 OH- will react with 0.2 H+.

So the neutralization produces 0.2 moles of H2O, releasing 0.2 *57.2 kJ = 11.44 kJ. So the enthalpy change is -11.44 kJ. Which is approximately -11.4 kJ.

Looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ, which is higher. Option B is -11.42 kcal. Wait, but 11.44 kJ is about 2.738 kcal. So that would suggest option A is correct.

Wait, now I'm confused because earlier I thought the answer was A, but the option B is in kcal.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the enthalpy per mole of H+ neutralized, but in the problem, the total is 0.2 moles. So the total enthalpy of neutralization is -11.44 kJ, which is approximately -2.72 kcal (since 11.44 / 4.184 ≈ 2.73).

But wait, no, wait. 57.2 kJ is per mole of H+ neutralized. So 0.2 moles would be 0.2 *57.2 = 11.44 kJ. That's 11.44 kJ, which is about 2.73 kcal. So the total enthalpy is -11.44 kJ, which is -2.73 kcal. Which matches option A.

But why is option B -11.42 kcal? That would imply the reaction is 0.2 moles but considering 57.2 kJ per mole as 13.66 kcal, but that doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the enthalpy in calories instead of kilocalories.

Wait, wait, 57.2 kJ is 57,200 J. To convert to kcal, divide by 4184 J per kcal.

57,200 / 4184 ≈ 13.66 kcal per mole.

So 0.2 moles would be 0.2 *13.66 ≈ 2.73 kcal. So the enthalpy change is -2.73 kcal. The option is A) -2.72 kcal, which is very close.

So the correct answer should be A.

Wait, but let me double-check my initial calculations. HCl: 0.2 *0.5=0.1, correct. H2SO4: 0.3 *0.3=0.09, each gives 2 H+ → 0.18. Ba(OH)2: 0.5 *0.2=0.1, gives 2 OH- → 0.2.

Total H+ =0.28, OH- 0.2. So OH- is limiting, 0.2 moles react.

Enthalpy change: 0.2 *57.2 kJ = 11.44 kJ. Or 11.44 kJ is approx 2.73 kcal. So option A is correct.

Wait, but why does option B have -11.42 kcal? That would be approximately 47.3 kJ (since 11.42 *4.184≈47.5). Hmm, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the enthalpy per mole of H2O formed, which is the same as per mole of H+ neutralized, so 57.2 kJ per mole. So 0.2 moles would be 11.44 kJ, or about -11.44 kJ. But in the options, D is -16.0 kJ, which is larger. So that's not matching. So perhaps the correct answer is B, but I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the reaction stoichiometry. Let me think again. The reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O. So the moles of H+ and OH- that react are equal. The limiting reagent is OH- (0.2 moles), so 0.2 H+ and 0.2 OH- react, producing 0.2 H2O. The enthalpy change is 0.2 *57.2 =11.44 kJ.

But the options are in kcal and kJ. So 11.44 kJ is about 2.73 kcal. So the correct answer should be option A.

Wait, but why is option B -11.42 kcal? Maybe the problem is considering that each mole of H2SO4 contributes two H+, so 0.09 *2=0.18 H+, and Ba(OH)2 contributes 0.2 moles OH-.

So the calculation is correct, and the answer is A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when mixing 500 mL 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL 0.3 M H₂SO₄, and 200 mL 0.5 M Ba(OH)₂, the following steps are performed:

1. **Determine moles of H⁺ and OH⁻ ions:**
   - **HCl (strong acid):**  
     Moles of HCl = \( 0.2 \, \text{M} \times 0.5 \, \text{L} = 0.1 \, \text{moles} \).  
     Each mole of HCl contributes 1 mole of H⁺, so \( 0.1 \, \text{moles of H⁺} \).
   - **H₂SO₄ (strong acid, diprotic):**  
     Moles of H₂SO₄ = \( 0.3 \, \text{M} \times 0.3 \, \text{L} = 0.09 \, \text{moles} \).  
     Each mole of H₂SO₄ contributes 2 moles of H⁺, so \( 0.09 \times 2 = 0.18 \, \text{moles of H⁺} \).
   - **Ba(OH)₂ (strong base):**  
     Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = \( 0.5 \, \text{M} \times 0.2 \, \text{L} = 0.1 \, \text{moles} \).  
     Each mole of Ba(OH)₂ contributes 2 moles of OH⁻, so \( 0.1 \times 2 = 0.2 \, \text{moles of OH⁻} \).

2. **Identify the limiting reagent:**
   - Total moles of H⁺ = \( 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 \, \text{moles} \).  
   - Total moles of OH⁻ = \( 0.2 \, \text{moles} \).  
   - OH⁻ is the limiting reagent because \( 0.2 \, \text{moles of OH⁻} < 0.28 \, \text{moles of H⁺} \).

3. **Calculate the enthalpy change:**
   - The reaction is \( \text{H⁺} + \text{OH⁻} \rightarrow \text{H₂O} \), and the enthalpy of neutralization is approximately \( -57.2 \, \text{kJ per mole of H⁺ neutralized} \).  
   - Since 0.2 moles of OH⁻ react, 0.2 moles of H⁺ are neutralized.  
   - Total enthalpy change = \( 0.2 \times (-57.2 \, \text{kJ}) = -11.44 \, \text{kJ} \).

4. **Convert units if necessary:**
   - To express the enthalpy change in kcal, use the conversion \( 1 \, \text{kcal} = 4.184 \, \text{kJ} \).  
     \[
     -11.44 \, \text{kJ} \div 4.184 \approx -2.73 \, \text{kcal}.
     \]

5. **Match the answer to the options:**
   - The calculated enthalpy change is approximately \( -2.73 \, \text{kcal} \), which is closest to option A (\( -2.72 \, \text{kcal} \)).

**Final Answer:**  
The enthalpy of neutralization for the reaction is approximately \( -2.72 \, \text{kcal} \).

Answer: A
