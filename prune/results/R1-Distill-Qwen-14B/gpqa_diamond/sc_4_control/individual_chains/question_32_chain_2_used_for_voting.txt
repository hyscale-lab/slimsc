Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, RHIC. The question is asking for the energy of the collider such that the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96c. The nucleus X is given as Li with 3 neutrons. Hmm, wait, Li is lithium, right? So the isotope would be... Let me think. Lithium has an atomic number of 3, so if it has 3 neutrons, the mass number is 3 + 3 = 6. So it's Li-6.

The question is about relativistic energy. So I remember that in relativity, the total energy of a particle is given by gamma times mc squared. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which depends on the velocity. Since the speed is given as 0.96c, I'll need to compute gamma for that speed.

Gamma is 1 divided by the square root of (1 minus v squared over c squared). Let me plug in the numbers. v is 0.96c, so v squared is (0.96)^2 c squared. Let me calculate that. 0.96 squared is 0.9216. So 1 minus 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is... Hmm, 0.28 because 0.28 squared is 0.0784. So gamma is 1 / 0.28, which is approximately 3.5714.

Wait, let me double-check that math. 0.96 squared is indeed 0.9216. Then 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. Square root of 0.0784 is 0.28 (since 0.28 * 0.28 = 0.0784). So yes, gamma is 1 / 0.28 = 3.571428... So about 3.5714.

Now, the energy is gamma * m * c². But wait, m here is the rest mass of the nucleus. So I need to find the rest mass of Li-6. The molar mass of Li-6 is about 6 atomic mass units (u). Wait, but to get the exact value, I might need to look it up, but maybe the problem assumes that each nucleon (proton or neutron) has a mass of about 1 u. Alternatively, perhaps the exact mass isn't needed because the options are given, but I should calculate it accurately.

Wait, the mass of a Li-6 nucleus. Lithium has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. Each proton is approximately 1.007276 u, and each neutron is about 1.008665 u. So the total would be 3*(1.007276) + 3*(1.008665). Let me compute that.

3 * 1.007276 = 3.021828 u
3 * 1.008665 = 3.025995 u
Adding them together gives 3.021828 + 3.025995 = 6.047823 u.

But wait, wait. I think the actual mass of Li-6 is slightly less than 6 u due to the binding energy, but perhaps for this problem, we can approximate it as 6 u. Hmm, but maybe the problem expects us to use the exact mass. Alternatively, maybe it's given as approximately 6 u. Hmm, but I'm not certain. Let's proceed with 6 u for calculation purposes unless I find another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is treating each nucleon as exactly 1 u, so Li-6 would have a mass of 6 u. That would make the mass m = 6 u * c². But I need the energy in GeV, so I'll have to convert that.

So, mass in kilograms: 1 u is 1.66053906660e-27 kg. So 6 u is 6 * 1.66053906660e-27 kg = 9.9632344e-27 kg.

The speed is 0.96c. Gamma is 3.5714 as before. So the energy E = gamma * m c².

Compute m c squared first. m c² is (6 u) c². 6 u is 6 * 1.6605e-27 kg = 9.963e-27 kg. c squared is (3e8 m/s)^2 = 9e16 m²/s².

So m c² is 9.963e-27 kg * 9e16 m²/s² = 9.963e-27 * 9e16 = 8.9667e-10 J. Let me compute that: 9e16 * 9.963e-27 = 9 * 9.963 = 89.667, and the exponent is 16-27 = -11. So 89.667e-11 J, which is 8.9667e-10 J.

Then multiply by gamma (3.5714) to get E = 3.5714 * 8.9667e-10 J. Let me compute that:

3.5714 * 8.9667 ≈ Let me see. 3 * 8.9667 is about 26.9001, 0.5714 * 8.9667 ≈ approx 5.126. So total about 32.026e-10 J.

Wait, 3.5714 * 8.9667e-10 = (3.5714 * 8.9667) * 1e-10.

Let me calculate 3.5714 * 8.9667:

3.5714 × 8.9667.

Let me compute 3 * 8.9667 = 26.9001.

0.5714 * 8.9667 ≈ let's see, 8 * 0.5714 is 4.5712, 0.9667 * 0.5714 ≈ 0.5525. So 4.5712 + 0.5525 ≈ 5.1237.

So total is 26.9001 + 5.1237 = 31.0238.

So E ≈ 31.0238e-10 J. Now, we need to convert this energy into GeV.

1 eV is 1.60218e-19 J. 1 GeV is 1e9 eV, so 1 GeV = 1.60218e-10 J.

So E in GeV is E [GeV] = E [J] / (1.60218e-10 J/GeV).

So E = 31.0238e-10 J / 1.60218e-10 J/GeV.

That's 31.0238 / 1.60218 ≈ Let me calculate that.

31 / 1.6 is approx 19.375, but let's compute more accurately.

31.0238 ÷ 1.60218: Let's compute 1.60218 × 19 = approx 30.44142. 19 gives 30.44142.

Subtract that from 31.0238: 31.0238 - 30.44142 = 0.58238.

Now, 0.58238 / 1.60218 ≈ 0.3635. So total is about 19.3635 GeV.

Wait, but wait. Earlier I approximated the mass as 6 u. But if the exact mass is a bit less due to binding energy, that would affect the calculation. Or perhaps the problem is using the mass as exactly 6 u, so my calculation would be correct. But maybe I should double-check the mass of Li-6.

Wait, the actual mass of Li-6 is approximately 6.015 atomic mass units. So let me use that. Because 3 protons and 3 neutrons would give a mass around 6 u, but the exact mass is about 6.015 u. Hmm, I think I remember that the mass of Li-6 is about 6.015 u.

So if I take m = 6.015 u, that would change the calculation.

So m = 6.015 u.

So m c² in J is 6.015 * 1.6605e-27 kg * (3e8 m/s)^2.

Wait, but I'll just compute the previous calculation again with m = 6.015 u.

So m = 6.015 u.

m c² = 6.015 * 1.6605e-27 kg * (9e16 m²/s²).

So 6.015 * 1.6605e-27 = 6.015 * 1.6605 = approx 10.0 (Wait, 6 *1.6605=9.963, 0.015*1.6605=0.0249075. So total is 9.963 + 0.0249075=9.9879075e-27 kg.)

So m c² = 9.9879e-27 kg * 9e16 m²/s² = 9.9879e-27 * 9e16 = 8.9891e-10 J.

Then multiply by gamma 3.5714 to get E = 3.5714 * 8.9891e-10 J.

3.5714 * 8.9891 = let's compute 3 * 8.9891 = 26.9673, 0.5714 * 8.9891 ≈ 5.124. So total is approx 32.0913e-10 J.

Again, converting to GeV: 32.0913e-10 J / 1.60218e-10 J/GeV ≈ 32.0913 / 1.60218 ≈ 20.029 GeV.

Wait, that's about 20 GeV. Now, looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is close. But let me compute more accurately.

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma again. Let me double-check gamma.

v = 0.96c. So gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.9216) = 1 / sqrt(0.0784) = 1/0.28 = 3.57142857.

Yes, that's correct.

Then, the exact mass of Li-6 is 6.01525 u. Let me use this value.

So m = 6.01525 u.

m in kg: 6.01525 * 1.66053906660e-27 kg = let's compute that.

6 * 1.66053906660e-27 = 9.9632344e-27 kg.

0.01525 * 1.66053906660e-27 = 0.01525 * 1.660539e-27 ≈ 0.025325e-27 kg = 2.5325e-29 kg.

So total m = 9.9632344e-27 + 2.5325e-29 = 9.9632344e-27 + 0.025325e-27 = 9.9885594e-27 kg.

So m c² = 9.9885594e-27 kg * (3e8 m/s)^2 = 9.9885594e-27 * 9e16 = (9.9885594 * 9) * 1e-11.

9.9885594 *9 = 89.8970346, so 89.8970346e-11 J = 8.98970346e-10 J.

Now, E = gamma * m c² = 3.57142857 * 8.98970346e-10 J.

3.57142857 * 8.98970346 = Let me compute this more accurately.

3 * 8.98970346 = 26.96911038

0.57142857 * 8.98970346 ≈ Let's compute 0.5 * 8.9897 = 4.49485. 0.07142857 * 8.9897 ≈ 0.64286. So total approximately 4.49485 + 0.64286 = 5.13771.

So total E = 26.96911 + 5.13771 ≈ 32.10682e-10 J.

Convert to GeV: 32.10682e-10 J / (1.60218e-10 J/GeV) = 32.10682 / 1.60218 ≈ 20.037 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV. Hmm, but my calculation gave about 20.037 GeV. But perhaps I made a mistake in the mass.

Wait, perhaps the mass is taken as exactly 6 u? Let me recalculate with m=6 u.

m=6 u.

m c² =6 * 1.6605e-27 * 9e16 = 6 * 1.6605e-27 * 9e16 = 6 * (1.6605 * 9) * 1e-11.

1.6605 *9 =14.9445. 6 *14.9445=89.667. So 89.667e-11 J = 8.9667e-10 J.

E = gamma * 8.9667e-10 = 3.5714 *8.9667e-10 = let's calculate 3.5714 *8.9667.

3.5714 *8.9667 = let me compute this more accurately.

3.5714 *8 =28.5712.

3.5714 *0.9667 ≈ let me compute 3.5714 *0.9 =3.21426, 3.5714 *0.0667≈0.2383. So total about 3.45256.

So total is 28.5712 +3.45256≈32.02376e-10 J.

32.02376e-10 J / 1.60218e-10 J/GeV =32.02376 /1.60218 ≈ 20.0 GeV.

So that's about 20 GeV. But the options are A)18.475, B)23.069, C)20.132, D)21.419.

Hmm, so 20 GeV is close to option C, but my precise calculation with m=6u gave 20.0 GeV. But when I used m=6.015u, it was about 20.037 GeV, which is closer to 20.04.

But none of the options is exactly 20. So perhaps I made a mistake in mass. Alternatively, perhaps the mass is taken as the sum of the individual nucleon masses. Or perhaps the problem expects relativistic energy to be calculated with the rest mass energy as (number of nucleons) * 931.5 MeV/u * (nucleon mass in u).

Wait, another approach: the rest mass energy of a nucleon is about 931.5 MeV per u. So for Li-6, which is 6 nucleons, the rest mass energy is 6 * 931.5 MeV.

So 6 *931.5=5589 MeV =5.589 GeV.

Then, gamma is 3.5714, so total energy is gamma * m c² =3.5714 *5.589 GeV.

Compute that: 3.5714 *5.589.

3 *5.589 =16.767.

0.5714 *5.589 ≈ 3.196.

Total 16.767+3.196=19.963 GeV≈20 GeV.

So that's about 20 GeV, which again points to option C being 20.132 GeV.

Wait, but why is there a discrepancy? Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation, or perhaps the problem uses a different rest mass.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the nucleus as a particle with mass equal to A * u, where A is the mass number. So for Li-6, A=6, so m =6 * u.

But in reality, the mass is slightly less due to binding energy, hence the mass is about 6.015 u, but perhaps the problem uses 6 u for simplicity.

Hmm, but according to the problem, the speed is 0.96c, so gamma is correct. So the energy E would be gamma multiplied by the rest energy.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the exact value using precise numbers.

Let me recompute E using m=6.015 u.

m c² =6.015u * 931.5 MeV/u = 6.015 ×931.5 MeV.

Compute that: 6 ×931.5=5589 MeV, 0.015 ×931.5=13.9725 MeV. Total is 5589 +13.9725 =5602.9725 MeV=5.6029725 GeV.

Now, multiply by gamma=3.57142857.

E =3.57142857 *5.6029725 GeV.

Compute 3 *5.6029725 =16.8089175.

0.57142857 *5.6029725 = let me compute 0.5 *5.6029725=2.80148625.

0.07142857 *5.6029725≈0.4019.

So total is 2.80148625 +0.4019≈3.20338625.

Adding to the 16.8089175, we get 16.8089175 +3.20338625=20.0123 GeV.

Hmm, so about 20.0123 GeV. But the options don't have 20.0123. Option C is 20.132 GeV. So perhaps I'm missing a more precise calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma more accurately. Let's compute gamma again using exact value for v=0.96c.

v =0.96c. So beta =0.96.

gamma=1/ sqrt(1 - beta^2) =1/sqrt(1 -0.96^2)=1/sqrt(1-0.9216) =1/sqrt(0.0784)=1/0.28.

Wait, but wait, 0.28 squared is 0.0784, so yes, gamma is exactly 3.57142857.

Now, computing 3.57142857 *5.6029725 GeV.

Let me compute precisely:

3.57142857 *5.6029725.

Break it down:

3 *5.6029725 =16.8089175.

0.5 *5.6029725 =2.80148625.

0.07142857 *5.6029725 = let's compute this.

0.07 *5.6029725 =0.392208075.

0.00142857 *5.6029725≈approx 0.00142857 *5.603 ≈0.007999.

So total ≈0.392208 +0.007999=0.400207.

Adding that to the previous parts: 16.8089175 +2.80148625=19.61040375 +0.400207≈20.01061075 GeV.

So about 20.0106 GeV. But the options don't have this, so perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in the calculation of the rest mass energy. Let me recompute that.

Wait, m=6.015 u. 1 u equals 931.5 MeV/c², so m c² =6.015×931.5 MeV.

Compute 6 ×931.5 =5589 MeV.

0.015 ×931.5=13.9725 MeV.

Total is 5589 +13.9725=5602.9725 MeV=5.6029725 GeV.

So that part is correct.

Wait, but perhaps the gamma calculation is a little off because I used a rounded value. Let me compute gamma more accurately.

gamma =1/(sqrt(1-beta^2)).

beta=0.96.

beta^2=0.9216.

1-beta^2=0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784)=0.28 exactly, so gamma is 3.571428571428571..., exactly 25/7, since 3.57142857 is 25/7=3.57142857.

So gamma is exactly 25/7.

So 25/7 multiplied by 5.6029725 GeV.

25/7=3.57142857.

So 3.57142857 *5.6029725 = ?

Let me compute 3.57142857 *5.6029725.

Alternatively, 5.6029725 *25 /7.

25/7 is approximately 3.57142857.

So 5.6029725 *25 = 140.0743125.

Divide by 7: 140.0743125 /7 ≈20.01061607 GeV.

So about 20.0106 GeV.

Looking at the options, none of them exactly match, but option C is 20.132 GeV, which is higher. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in mass.

Wait, perhaps the mass of Li-6 is 6.015 u, but maybe the calculation is done per nucleon, or perhaps the problem uses a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the kinetic energy is being asked instead of total energy. Wait, no, the question asks for the energy of the collider, which I believe is the total energy (kinetic plus rest mass). But perhaps the problem is considering only the kinetic energy. Wait, no, because the options are in GeV, and 20 GeV is reasonable.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the question is using the mass of the lithium nucleus as the sum of the individual protons and neutrons, which would be 6 u exactly. So let's compute that.

m =6 u.

m c² =6 *931.5=5589 MeV=5.589 GeV.

E=gamma * m c² =3.57142857 *5.589 GeV.

3.57142857 *5.589.

Let me compute 3 *5.589=16.767.

0.57142857 *5.589: 0.5 *5.589=2.7945; 0.07142857 *5.589≈0.4004.

So 2.7945 + 0.4004=3.1949.

Total E=16.767 +3.1949=20. (approx 19.9619 GeV). Hmm, about 19.96 GeV.

But the options don't have this. The closest is option C:20.132 GeV.

Wait, perhaps I should use more precise values for gamma. Let me compute gamma more accurately.

gamma =1/sqrt(1 - beta²), beta=0.96.

Compute 1-beta^2: 1 - 0.96^2=1 -0.9216=0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784)=0.28 exactly. So gamma=1/0.28=3.5714285714285714.

So gamma is exactly 25/7.

So perhaps the precise calculation is needed.

Wait, perhaps the rest mass energy is taken as 6 *931.5 MeV. So 6*931.5=5589 MeV=5.589 GeV.

So E_total=gamma * m c² = (25/7) *5.589 GeV.

Compute 25/7 *5.589.

25 *5.589 = 139.725.

139.725 /7=19.960714 GeV.

So approximately 19.9607 GeV, which is about 19.96 GeV.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses the exact mass of the Li-6 nucleus, which is 6.01525 u. So, m=6.01525 u.

So m c²=6.01525 u *931.5 MeV/u=6.01525 *931.5 MeV.

Calculate 6 *931.5=5589.

0.01525 *931.5=14.17 MeV.

So total m c²=5589 +14.17=5603.17 MeV=5.60317 GeV.

E=gamma * m c²= (25/7) *5.60317 GeV.

25/7=3.57142857.

3.57142857 *5.60317.

Let me compute 3 *5.60317 =16.80951.

0.57142857 *5.60317.

0.5 *5.60317=2.801585.

0.07142857 *5.60317≈0.4015.

So 2.801585 +0.4015=3.203085.

Total E=16.80951 +3.203085=20.012595 GeV.

So about 20.0126 GeV.

But the options are C)20.132 and D)21.419.

Hmm, so perhaps the correct approach is to take m=6 u, leading to E≈19.96 GeV, which is closest to option C.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the calculation to ignore the decimal points beyond a certain precision, but this is getting confusing.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a factor of 2 somewhere. No, I don't think so. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is referring to the kinetic energy, not the total energy.

Wait, let me clarify: The question asks for the energy of the RHIC, which would be the total energy (gamma mc²), not just the kinetic energy.

If the problem were asking for kinetic energy, it would be (gamma -1) mc². But that's not the case here.

Wait, perhaps I should double-check my calculation for gamma.

Wait, gamma when v=0.96c.

gamma=1/sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2 )=1/sqrt(1 -0.9216)=1/sqrt(0.0784)=1/0.28=3.57142857.

Yes, that's correct.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the mass is taken as the atomic mass including electrons. But no, for heavy ions, the electrons are negligible, so the mass is approximately the mass of the nucleus.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the problem uses m = 6 u, leading to E=20 GeV, but then why is option C 20.132 GeV?

Wait, perhaps the precise calculation with m=6.015 u gives a value close to 20 GeV, but the options don't have that. So perhaps the intended approach is to use m=6 u, leading to E=20 GeV, but the options are not exactly matching. Alternatively, perhaps the calculation is supposed to use the proton mass. No, that wouldn't make sense because Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of E.

Wait, if m=6.015 u, then m c²=6.015 *931.5 MeV=5603.5875 MeV=5.6035875 GeV.

E =gamma * m c²=3.57142857 *5.6035875 GeV.

3.57142857 *5.6035875.

Let me compute this precisely.

3.57142857 *5.6035875.

Compute 3 *5.6035875=16.8107625.

0.57142857 *5.6035875.

Compute 0.5 *5.6035875=2.80179375.

0.07142857 *5.6035875=0.401672.

So 2.80179375 +0.401672=3.20346575.

Total E=16.8107625 +3.20346575=20.01422825 GeV.

So approximately 20.0142 GeV.

But the options are:

A)18.475 GeV

B)23.069 GeV

C)20.132 GeV

D)21.419 GeV.

So 20.0142 GeV is closest to option C, which is 20.132 GeV. But how?

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the value of the mass. If the mass is 6.02 u, then:

m c²=6.02 *931.5=5607.43 MeV=5.60743 GeV.

E=gamma *5.60743=3.57142857 *5.60743= ?

3.57142857 *5 =17.85714285

3.57142857 *0.60743≈3.57142857 *0.6=2.14285714; 3.57142857 *0.00743≈0.02652.

So 2.14285714+0.02652=2.16937.

Total E=17.85714285 +2.16937=20.02651 GeV.

Still close to 20 GeV.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects using the relativistic energy formula with the speed given as 0.96c and the mass as 6 u, leading to E=20 GeV, but the options don't have that. So perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses the mass of the lithium nucleus as 6.015 u but uses more precise gamma calculation. Let me do that.

gamma=25/7=3.5714285714285714.

m c²=6.015 *931.5=5602.9725 MeV=5.6029725 GeV.

E=3.57142857 *5.6029725= ?

Compute accurately:

3.57142857 *5.6029725.

Let me compute 3.57142857 *5 =17.85714285.

3.57142857 *0.6029725.

0.6029725=0.6+0.0029725.

3.57142857 *0.6=2.14285714.

3.57142857 *0.0029725≈0.01057.

So total for 0.6029725: 2.14285714 +0.01057=2.15342714.

Thus, 3.57142857 *5.6029725=17.85714285 +2.15342714=20.01057 GeV.

So approximately 20.01057 GeV, which is about 20.0106 GeV.

But looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is about 0.12 GeV higher. So perhaps the problem expects using a more precise value for gamma.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the speed is given as 0.96c, but I should calculate gamma using more precise calculations.

Wait, 0.96 squared is exactly 0.9216. 1-0.9216=0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28 exactly, so no issue there. So gamma is exactly 3.57142857.

Hmm. I'm thinking that maybe the intended answer is option C, perhaps due to a miscalculation in the problem setup.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the nucleus's mass as 6.94 u (like for another isotope), but that doesn't make sense for Li-6.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses the rest mass energy as 6.94 GeV. Wait, no, that would be for a different isotope.

Another possibility: perhaps the problem is using the mass of the lithium nucleus as 6.94 u, but that would be for something like Li-7.

Wait, no, the problem states that X is Li with 3 neutrons, which is Li-6.

Hmm. Maybe I should check what the actual rest mass of Li-6 is.

Upon checking, the exact mass of Li-6 is about 6.01525 u. So that was correct.

So with m=6.01525 u, E=20.01 GeV.

But the options are:

A)18.475 GeV

B)23.069 GeV

C)20.132 GeV

D)21.419 GeV.

So 20.01 is closest to option C (20.132) but not exactly.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of gamma.

Wait, perhaps the speed is given as 0.96c, but perhaps the value is not exactly 0.96, but a more precise value. Wait, the problem states "0.96c", so it's precise.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the calculation to be done using the exact gamma value without approximating.

Let me compute gamma exactly.

gamma =1/(sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2)).

Compute 0.96^2=0.9216; 1-0.9216=0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784)=0.28.

gamma=1/0.28=3.5714285714285714.

So gamma is 3.5714285714285714.

m c²=6.01525 u *931.5 MeV/u=5603.03 MeV=5.60303 GeV.

E=3.5714285714285714 *5.60303 GeV.

Compute this:

3.5714285714285714 *5=17.857142857142856.

3.5714285714285714 *0.60303= ?

Compute 3.5714285714285714 *0.6=2.1428571428571426.

3.5714285714285714 *0.00303=0.010817142857142849.

Add them: 2.1428571428571426 +0.010817142857142849=2.1536742857143855.

So total E=17.857142857142856 +2.1536742857143855=20.01081714285724 GeV.

Approximately 20.0108 GeV.

But none of the options is 20.0108. So perhaps the intended answer is option C, but I'm not sure why. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the question refers to the kinetic energy, not the total energy. Let me check that.

Kinetic energy (K) is (gamma -1) m c².

If K is what's being asked, then:

K = (3.57142857 -1) *5.60303 GeV=2.57142857 *5.60303 GeV.

2.57142857 *5=12.85714285.

2.57142857 *0.60303≈1.5508.

Total K≈12.85714285 +1.5508≈14.4079 GeV.

But the options are all higher than 18 GeV, so that's not likely.

Hmm. I'm a bit stuck. The calculation points to about 20 GeV, but the closest option is C:20.132 GeV. But my precise calculation gives about 20.01 GeV. So perhaps the intended answer is option C, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the calculation using precise numbers without rounding.

Let me compute 3.57142857 *5.60303 precisely.

3.57142857 *5.60303.

Break it into 3 + 0.57142857.

3 *5.60303 =16.80909.

0.57142857 *5.60303.

Compute 0.5 *5.60303 =2.801515.

0.07142857 *5.60303 ≈0.401532.

So total 2.801515 +0.401532=3.203047.

So E=16.80909 +3.203047=20.012137 GeV.

So approximately 20.0121 GeV.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps the correct answer is option C, which is 20.132 GeV. But why is there a discrepancy?

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses a different value for c or other constants. For example, using c=3e8 m/s, but that's standard.

Wait, perhaps the mass is taken as 6.02 u, leading to a higher energy.

6.02 u would be m c²=6.02 *931.5=5611.83 MeV=5.61183 GeV.

E=gamma *5.61183=3.5714 *5.61183.

3 *5.61183=16.83549.

0.5714 *5.61183≈3.204.

Total E=16.83549 +3.204=20.03949 GeV≈20.0395 GeV. Still not matching the options.

Hmm. I'm not finding the mistake, so perhaps I should conclude that the intended answer is option C, 20.132 GeV, but I'm not entirely sure.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) such that the speed of the lithium-6 (Li-6) nucleus is 0.96c, we use the relativistic energy formula:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2
\]

where \( \gamma \) is the Lorentz factor, \( m \) is the rest mass of the nucleus, and \( c \) is the speed of light. The steps are as follows:

---

### 1. **Calculate \( \gamma \):**
The Lorentz factor is given by:

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}
\]

For \( v = 0.96c \):
\[
v^2/c^2 = (0.96)^2 = 0.9216, \quad 1 - v^2/c^2 = 0.0784, \quad \sqrt{0.0784} = 0.28
\]
\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{0.28} = 3.57142857
\]

---

### 2. **Determine the rest mass energy \( m c^2 \):**
The nucleus is Li-6, which has a mass of approximately \( 6.015 \, \text{u} \) (atomic mass units). Using \( 1 \, \text{u} = 931.5 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \):

\[
m c^2 = 6.015 \times 931.5 \, \text{MeV} = 5603.03 \, \text{MeV} = 5.60303 \, \text{GeV}
\]

---

### 3. **Calculate the total energy \( E \):**
Substitute \( \gamma \) and \( m c^2 \) into the energy formula:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2 = 3.57142857 \times 5.60303 \, \text{GeV}
\]

Breaking this into parts:
\[
3 \times 5.60303 = 16.80909, \quad 0.57142857 \times 5.60303 \approx 3.203047
\]
\[
E = 16.80909 + 3.203047 = 20.012137 \, \text{GeV}
\]

Thus, the total energy is approximately \( 20.0121 \, \text{GeV} \).

---

### 4. **Compare with the options:**
The calculated energy \( 20.0121 \, \text{GeV} \) is closest to option **C) 20.132 GeV**, though slightly lower. This discrepancy may arise from rounding differences or approximations in the problem setup.

---

### Final Answer:
Based on the calculations, the closest option is:

**Answer: C**
