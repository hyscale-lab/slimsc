Okay, so I'm trying to solve this electron microscopy question. Let me read it carefully.

Mike is working on a high-resolution transmission electron microscope operating at 1000 kV. To get a good image, he uses vacuum pumps to create an ultra-high vacuum, less than 10^-9 Torr. The idea is to remove as many gas molecules as possible because they can interfere with the electron beam. But even after doing that, some gas particles are still present, detected by a mass spectrometer. 

Mike calculates the mean free path of these gas molecules as λ1. The mean free path is the average distance a molecule travels between collisions. Factors like pressure, temperature, and compartment volume probably affect this. 

Then, when he starts the electron beam, he notices something interesting. The mean free path changes from λ1 to λ2. But the temperature in the compartment didn't change, so that's not the reason for the change.

Hmm, so what's causing λ2 to differ from λ1? The main difference between before and after the electron beam is activated is the presence of the beam. The electron beam must be interacting with the gas molecules in some way.

I remember that in electron microscopy, the electron beam can cause various effects. One possibility is that the gas molecules are being ionized by the electrons. When a gas molecule is ionized, it becomes charged. Charged particles interact more strongly with the electric fields in the microscope, but wait, how does that affect their movement?

Wait, in a high vacuum, the mean free path is determined by the collisions between gas molecules. But when the electron beam is on, perhaps the gas molecules are getting knocked out of the compartment. Because the electron beam can cause sputtering or ionization, which might lead the gas molecules to either stick to the walls or be extracted from the system.

If the gas is being removed, the pressure would effectively decrease. Lower pressure would increase the mean free path because, at lower pressure, gas molecules are less dense and collide less frequently. So the mean free path should be longer. 

But wait, the mean free path equation is λ = 1/(n * σ * sqrt(2)), where n is the number density, σ is the collision cross-section. So if n decreases, λ increases. 

In this scenario, Mike's initial mean free path is λ1, but when the beam is on, more collisions might happen between electrons and gas molecules, leading to the gas being removed. So the number density n would decrease. That would make λ2 larger than λ1. So λ2 > λ1.

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, maybe the electron beam causes the gas to be ionized, and the ions are accelerated by the electric fields in the microscope. If the ions are accelerated, they might be expelled from the vacuum chamber, which would lower the effective pressure, thus increasing the mean free path. So yes, λ2 would be longer.

But looking at the options, let's see:

Options:
A) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1
B) λ2 = λ1, so Mike is wrong
C) λ2 < λ1
D) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1

Wait, but why would λ2 be more than 1.22 times λ1? The options suggest that A is a possibility, but I'm not exactly sure about the multiplier.

Alternatively, perhaps the electron beam introduces some other effect. For instance, when the beam is on, the gas molecules might become excited or charged, perhaps altering their effective cross-section. But I'm not certain about that. 

Wait, another thought: when the electron beam is on, it's possible that the gas molecules are being heated due to the beam's energy. But the problem states that the temperature remained the same, so that's not it. So the temperature is the same, so the initial calculation of λ1 is correct under those conditions.

But when the beam is on, perhaps the gas is being ionized and then accelerated. So the effective pressure in the compartment decreases because some molecules are being removed. Thus, n decreases, so λ increases.

So λ2 would be greater than λ1. So the correct options are A or D, but D says λ2 is between λ1 and 1.22λ1, while A says it's at least 1.22 times.

But why 1.22? Wait, 1.22 is approximately sqrt( (pi * (d/2)^2 ) ) or something else? Wait, 1.22 is the factor for a Gaussian beam's waist, but maybe that's not relevant here.

Alternatively, perhaps when the electron beam is applied, the gas molecules are being pumped out more efficiently, leading to a lower pressure, hence a longer mean free path. But without knowing the exact mechanism, I can't be sure of the multiplier.

Wait, but the mean free path λ is inversely proportional to pressure. Since the pressure is lower when the electron beam is on, λ would increase. So λ2 > λ1.

Looking at the options, the only ones that have λ2 > λ1 are A and D.

But the question is, why would λ2 be greater than λ1? Because the electron beam is causing the gas to be removed, lowering the pressure. So λ increases. So the options are A (λ2 >=1.22λ1) or D (λ2 is between λ1 and 1.22λ1).

But how much would λ2 be compared to λ1? That depends on how much the pressure decreased. If the pressure dropped, say, by a factor of 2, then λ would double. So maybe λ2 is significantly larger than λ1, so option A would be possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the electron beam causes the gas molecules to be ionized and then expelled, so the pressure drops, making λ increase. But without knowing how much the pressure changed, it's hard to say if λ2 is 1.22 times or more.

Wait, perhaps another approach. The mean free path λ is given by λ = 1/(n√2 σ), where σ is the collision cross-section. If the electron beam causes ionization, which leads to the gas ions being accelerated and leaving the vacuum chamber, reducing n. So n2 < n1. Thus, λ2 = 1/(n2 √2 σ) > λ1, since n2 < n1.

So λ2 > λ1. So the options are A or D. 

But the problem doesn't give any specific reason why λ2 would be exactly 1.22 times. So perhaps the initial setup assumed a certain condition, and the beam changes that.

Wait, another thought: when the electron beam is on, perhaps the gas molecules are being bombarded and their mean free path is effectively increased because they are being removed from the system. But is there any other factor?

Alternatively, maybe the presence of the electron beam introduces additional scattering mechanisms. Wait, but the question states that the mean free path based on electron scattering changed. So perhaps the gas molecules are now scattering electrons, but how does that affect their own mean free path?

Wait, the mean free path λ is for the gas molecules colliding with each other. But if the electron beam is causing the gas molecules to be ionized and removed, then the gas density n decreases, so λ (for gas-gas collisions) increases. So λ2 is larger than λ1.

So λ2 > λ1. So option A or D.

But I don't have enough information to choose between A and D. The question says that Mike made an observation that the mean free path was no longer λ1, but became λ2. So without knowing the exact factor, perhaps the correct answer is that λ2 is greater than λ1, so either A or D is correct.

Wait, another point: when the electron beam is on, the gas might be pumped out more effectively. So the pressure in the chamber would drop. The mean free path is inversely proportional to pressure, assuming that temperature is the same. So if pressure halves, λ doubles.

But in the initial setup, the mean free path was λ1, but after the electron beam is on, the pressure is lower, so λ would be higher. So λ2 is greater than λ1. So the correct options are A or D.

But why would the answer be A? Because the factor might be more than 1.22. Or perhaps the scenario is different.

Wait, another possibility: when the electron beam is on, it causes additional scattering of the gas molecules. Wait, but that would decrease the mean free path, making λ2 smaller. But that contradicts earlier reasoning.

Wait, but no, the mean free path of the gas molecules is about their collisions with each other, not with the electrons. The electron beam's presence might increase the rate at which gas molecules are lost, leading to lower n and higher λ.

Alternatively, maybe the gas molecules are being heated because of the electron beam? But the problem says the temperature remained the same, so that can't be it.

I think the key is that when the electron beam is on, the gas is being pumped out more efficiently. So the pressure drops, leading to a longer mean free path. So the correct conclusion is that λ2 is greater than λ1. So λ2 > λ1.

Looking at the options, the options that have λ2 greater than λ1 are A and D.

But the options don't have just λ2 > λ1, so the answer must be either A or D. Now, why would the answer be A or D?

Ah! Wait, perhaps when the electron beam is on, the gas molecules are being ionized, and the ionized gas is either being expelled from the system or sticking to the walls. So the number density n decreases, which increases λ. So λ2 is larger than λ1. So λ2 > λ1.

But the options don't have a "greater than" option; they have specific ratios. So the only options are A and D.

Wait, maybe in the initial setup, the pressure is P, and the mean free path is λ1. When the electron beam is on, the pressure drops to P', which is lower. Since λ is proportional to 1/(P * sqrt(T)), but temperature is same, so λ2 = λ1 * (P / P').

If the pressure is reduced by a factor of 1/2, λ doubles. But if the pressure is just slightly lower, λ increases but not by much. 

But the question says that some gas particles remained, detected by the mass spectrometer. So perhaps the pressure didn't drop a lot, but enough that the mean free path changed.

Wait, but without knowing the extent of the pressure change, it's hard to say whether λ2 is more than 1.22λ1 or just a little larger.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the physics again.

The mean free path λ is given by the formula:

λ = 1/(n σ √2)

Where n is the number density, σ is the collision cross-section.

When the electron beam is on, the gas is being removed, so n decreases. So λ2 = 1/(n2 σ √2) = (n1/(n2)) * λ1.

Since n2 < n1, λ2 > λ1.

Therefore, λ2 must be greater than λ1. So the possible options are A or D.

But why would λ2 be greater than λ1 but less than 1.22λ1? Or why more than 1.22 times.

Wait, perhaps when the electron beam is on, it causes gas molecules to be ionized, and the ionized gas is then more effectively pumped out by the vacuum system. So the pressure drops significantly, making λ2 much larger than λ1.

Alternatively, maybe the electron beam itself causes a change in the effective cross-section. But I think the main effect is the drop in pressure.

But the problem doesn't give specific numbers, so perhaps the correct answer is that λ2 is greater than λ1, so the options are A or D.

Wait, the options are:

A) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1

But why 1.22? Hmm, 1.22 is approximately sqrt( (pi * (d/2)^2 ) ), but I'm not sure where that would come from. Alternatively, 1.22 is approximately 4/π, which is about 1.27, but that's close to 1.22.

Alternatively, perhaps the 1.22 factor is a red herring. The question is about whether λ2 is greater than λ1, so the correct answer is either A or D.

But the options don't have a 'greater than' option. So perhaps the correct answer is that λ2 is greater than λ1, so the options are A or D.

Wait, maybe the correct answer is C) λ2 < λ1, but that's opposite of what I thought earlier. But why would that happen?

Wait, perhaps the electron beam causes the gas molecules to scatter more, leading to a shorter mean free path. But wait, that would be the opposite effect. But the mean free path is about the average distance between gas-gas collisions. If the electron beam causes more gas molecules to be removed, then n decreases, so mean free path increases.

So λ2 should be larger than λ1, making options A or D correct.

But without knowing the exact factor, perhaps the correct answer is that λ2 is greater than λ1, so either A or D.

Wait, but the question asks what we can conclude about λ2. So the most certain conclusion is that λ2 is greater than λ1, so λ2 > λ1. In the given options, the only options where λ2 > λ1 are A and D.

But looking at option D: λ1 < λ2 <1.22λ1.

Option A: λ2 >=1.22λ1.

So why would λ2 be more than 1.22 times? Because if the pressure drops enough, then λ2 could be larger than that.

But without knowing the extent, perhaps the correct conclusion is that λ2 is greater than λ1, so either A or D is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing another factor. Let's think about the initial setup. The mean free path λ1 is determined based on the factors like volume, pressure, and temperature. But when the electron beam is on, the gas is ionized and perhaps the effective cross-section changes. 

Wait, another angle: the presence of the electron beam might cause the gas molecules to be more likely to collide with the electron beam, which is a different kind of scattering. But I'm not sure how that affects the mean free path of the gas molecules with each other.

Alternatively, perhaps the ionized gas molecules have a larger effective cross-section. If σ increases, then λ would decrease. But that would require that the collision cross-section increases, which might not be the case if they are being ionized and expelled.

Wait, if the gas molecules are being ionized, they become charged, which might make them more likely to stick to the walls of the chamber, effectively removing them from the system. So n decreases, so λ increases.

Alternatively, if the gas is being ionized, perhaps the effective cross-section for gas-gas collisions increases because the ions have larger size or something. But I'm not certain about that.

Hmm, this is getting a bit tricky. Let me think about vacuum systems. In ultra-high vacuum systems, the mean free path can be quite long. When you have a lower pressure, the mean free path increases. So when the electron beam is on, perhaps the gas is being pumped out, lowering the pressure, hence increasing λ.

Therefore, λ2 > λ1.

So the options are A or D.

Which one is correct?

Well, the problem states that the mean free path after the electron beam starts is λ2, which is different from λ1. So the relationship is that λ2 is larger than λ1.

So among the options, which ones have λ2 larger? A and D.

But without knowing the exact factor, perhaps the correct conclusion is that λ2 is greater than λ1, so the answer is either A or D.

Wait, perhaps the mean free path formula can be used. The formula is:

λ = (k*T) / (sqrt(2) * π * d^2 * P)

Wait, another version: λ = ( (k*T) / (sqrt(2)*π*d^2) ) * (1/P)

Where d is the diameter of the gas molecule, k is Boltzmann's constant, T is temperature, and P is pressure.

Since the temperature is same, if pressure P decreases, λ increases.

So, if P2 < P1, then λ2 = λ1 * (P1/P2) > λ1.

So λ2 is larger.

So the correct answer is that λ2 > λ1. Among options, A and D are possibilities.

But why would λ2 be greater than 1.22 times? Or is it possibly just a small increase.

But the problem doesn't specify the extent of the pressure change. So perhaps the most correct conclusion is that λ2 is larger than λ1, but how much?

Wait, perhaps the presence of the electron beam causes the gas to be ionized, and the ionized gas is then more effectively pumped out by the vacuum system. So the pressure drops a lot, making λ2 much larger.

If the pressure is, say, 1/4 of the original, then λ2 would be 4 times λ1. So in that case, λ2 would be much larger than 1.22 times.

But without knowing how much the pressure drops, perhaps the correct conclusion is that λ2 is greater than λ1, which would include options A or D.

But the options don't have a 'greater than' option. So perhaps the correct answer is A) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1.

Alternatively, maybe the scenario is that the electron beam causes gas molecules to be scattered in a way that their mean free path is reduced. But that would mean λ2 < λ1, but that's option C.

Wait, but earlier reasoning suggests that λ2 > λ1. So I'm a bit confused.

Wait, perhaps I should think about how the electron beam affects the gas molecules. The electron beam has a high energy, so when it hits the gas molecules, it can knock them into the walls of the chamber (sputtering) or ionize them. If the gas molecules are ionized, they can be accelerated by the electric fields in the microscope and get expelled from the system, which lowers the pressure.

So the pressure drops, so λ increases. So λ2 is larger.

But the problem says that Mike accurately determined the mean free path λ1 based on the factors. So perhaps λ1 was calculated under the assumption that the only gas present is what was measured. But when the electron beam is on, the gas is removed, so the actual n is lower, leading to a longer mean free path.

So the conclusion is that λ2 > λ1. So the options are A or D.

But why would λ2 be at least 1.22 times λ1? Perhaps because the presence of the electron beam causes additional factors, such as a change in the effective collision cross-section. Or perhaps the factor comes from a formula involving the electron beam's effect.

Alternatively, maybe the vacuum system's pumping efficiency increases when the electron beam is on, leading to a significant drop in pressure. But without knowing, perhaps the correct choice is that λ2 is larger than λ1, so λ2 >= λ1. But the options don't have that.

Wait, looking again at the options:

A) λ2 >= 1.22 λ1

B) λ2 = λ1, discrepancy in observation

C) λ2 < λ1

D) λ1 < λ2 <1.22 λ1

So the options are either A (>=1.22), D (in between), or C (smaller).

Wait, but from the reasoning, λ2 should be larger. So options A and D.

But why would the answer be A or D?

Well, perhaps the mean free path λ1 was calculated under certain assumptions, but when the electron beam is applied, the effective pressure is lower, making λ2 larger.

But without knowing the exact factor, I can't choose between A and D.

Wait, perhaps the question is testing the concept that the mean free path increases when the pressure decreases. So the correct conclusion is that λ2 is larger than λ1, so the answer is either A or D.

But the options A and D are the only ones where λ2 is larger. So perhaps the correct answer is A or D.

Wait, another approach: when the electron beam is on, the gas molecules are being ionized and pumped out, which makes the pressure lower. So the mean free path increases. So λ2 is larger. But how much?

If the initial pressure is P, and the pressure after is P', then λ2 = (P / P') * λ1.

If P' is much smaller than P, λ2 is much larger.

But perhaps the pressure change is such that λ2 would be at least 1.22 times λ1. That could be the case if the pressure is reduced by 1/0.833, which is about 1.2 times.

In any case, the only options where λ2 is larger are A and D. Since the question asks what can we conclude, the only certain conclusion is that λ2 > λ1. So the answer must be either A or D, but without more info, perhaps the intended answer is A.

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the electron beam causes the gas molecules to be more likely to collide with the beam, which could cause them to leave the system, thus lowering n and increasing λ. So the mean free path λ increases, so λ2>λ1.

So the possible answers are A and D.

But the question specifies that the mean free path is no longer λ1, which implies that it's changed either way. So the correct answer is either A or C.

But earlier reasoning says that it's increased, so the correct answer is A or D.

Wait, another angle: the mean free path was calculated as λ1 without the electron beam. But when the beam is on, the gas is ionized, and the ions are accelerated. So perhaps the ions are moving away from the beam area, leading to a lower density in that area. So the mean free path in the region where the electron beam is present increases.

But this is getting too speculative.

Given all this, I think the correct conclusion is that λ2 is greater than λ1, so the answer is either A or D.

But looking at the options, option A is λ2 >= 1.22 * λ1, and D is λ2 between λ1 and 1.22λ1. 

Wait, perhaps the initial setup didn't account for the fact that the electron beam would cause the gas to be expelled, leading to a much lower pressure. In that case, λ2 could be significantly larger than λ1, making option A correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the change is small, making option D correct.

But without specific data, it's hard to choose.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is C) λ2 < λ1. But that would mean that the mean free path is shorter after the electron beam is on, which contradicts the earlier reasoning.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Maybe the presence of the electron beam causes gas molecules to be more likely to collide with the beam, which would change their mean free path.

Wait, but the mean free path λ1 was calculated based on gas-gas collisions. When the electron beam is on, perhaps gas-electron collisions are more frequent, which could cause gas molecules to be removed, thus decreasing n. Thus, λ increases.

But the presence of the electron beam might also affect the gas molecules in such a way that their effective cross-section changes. If the cross-section increases, λ would decrease. So if the gas molecules are ionized and have a larger cross-section, then λ would decrease. But I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, if the gas molecules are ionized, they might have a larger effective size, increasing σ and thus decreasing λ. But if the pressure drops, n decreases, which would increase λ. So the two effects might cancel each other out.

Wait, the mean free path λ is inversely proportional to n and σ. So if n decreases and σ increases, which effect is stronger?

It depends on the relative changes. If n decreases by a factor of 2 and σ increases by a factor of 1.5, then λ would increase by a factor of 2/1.5 ≈ 1.33. So λ2 would be larger than λ1.

But without knowing the changes, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, perhaps the main effect is the change in n due to gas being expelled, making λ2 larger than λ1.

So, in conclusion, the correct answer is that λ2 is greater than λ1. So the options are A or D.

But looking at the options, the only option where λ2 is larger is A and D. So the correct answer would be either of those. But the question states that Mike observed a change, so we can't assume λ2 equals λ1.

Since I can't be certain between A and D, perhaps the intended answer is that λ2 is greater than λ1, so either A or D.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the electron beam causes the gas to be ionized, and the ionized gas is more effectively pumped out by the vacuum system, which reduces the pressure significantly. So the pressure drops, making λ2 much larger than λ1. So the correct answer would be A.

But without knowing the exact pressure change, perhaps the correct answer is that λ2 is greater than λ1, so the possible options are A or D.

But given that the options are A, B, C, D, and the correct conclusion is λ2 > λ1, the options are A and D.

But looking back at the problem statement, it says that Mike found that the mean free path was no longer λ1. So the conclusion is that λ2 is greater than λ1. Among the options, only A and D fit.

But the question doesn't give any information about the magnitude, so perhaps the correct answer is that λ2 is greater than λ1, so the only option that allows for that is A, which says λ2 >= 1.22λ1.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is C) λ2 < λ1, but that contradicts earlier reasoning.

Wait, but maybe the presence of the electron beam increases the rate of gas-gas collisions, thus decreasing the mean free path. That would imply λ2 < λ1. But how?

Wait, if the electron beam somehow makes the gas molecules more likely to collide with each other, that would increase the collision rate, making λ smaller. But that seems counterintuitive because the electron beam would be expelling the gas, making collisions less frequent.

Alternatively, perhaps the electron beam causes the gas to heat up, but the problem states that temperature remains the same. So that's not it.

I think I'm stuck between options A and D. But considering that Mike accurately determined λ1, and then upon starting the beam, the gas is being more effectively removed, making the pressure lower, thus λ2 is larger than λ1. But the exact factor isn't given, so the correct conclusion is that λ2 is larger than λ1, which is either A or D.

In the absence of more information, perhaps the intended answer is that λ2 is greater than λ1, making the correct option A or D. Since the question asks which can we conclude, and the options don't allow for a simple 'greater than', perhaps the intended answer is A) λ2 >=1.22λ1.

But wait, another angle: the mean free path λ is inversely proportional to the square root of the pressure. So if the pressure is P, then λ ∝ 1/sqrt(P).

When the electron beam is on, the pressure might drop to P', so λ2 = λ1 * sqrt(P / P').

If P' is less than P, then λ2 is larger.

But without knowing P', we can't determine the ratio. Therefore, the only conclusion is that λ2 is larger than λ1.

But the options are A and D. Hmm, I think I'm stuck.

Wait, another approach: when the electron beam is on, the gas molecules are being removed from the system, so the effective pressure is lower. Thus, the mean free path should be longer. So the only possible options are A and D.

But the problem doesn't give any indication of how much the mean free path changes. So the only conclusion is λ2 > λ1. So the options are A and D.

But since the question is presented as multiple-choice, perhaps the intended answer is option C, but that contradicts my earlier reasoning. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is C, but I don't see why.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming that the electron beam causes the gas to be removed. Maybe the electron beam makes the gas molecules more likely to collide with the electron beam, which causes them to be scattered in a way that increases their mean free path? Or perhaps the electrons cause the gas molecules to move faster, thus increasing the collision rate. But that would require higher temperature, which isn't the case.

I'm going to make a decision based on the reasoning that λ2 > λ1, so the correct answer is either A or D. Since the problem doesn't specify the factor, perhaps the intended answer is that λ2 is greater than λ1, so the correct option is A) λ2 >=1.22λ1.

But I'm not entirely confident. Another possibility is that the electron beam causes the gas to be ionized, making the mean free path shorter because the ions may have a larger cross-section. But that would require that the collision cross-section increases more than the number density decreases, which would make λ2 < λ1. But that would contradict the earlier conclusion, so I think that's less likely.

In conclusion, I think the correct answer is that λ2 is greater than λ1, so the options are A or D. Since the question doesn't specify, I'll choose the option that λ2 is greater, which is either A or D.

But the given options are A) λ2 >=1.22λ1, D) λ1 < λ2 <1.22λ1.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is that λ2 is greater than λ1 but less than 1.22 times. So option D.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the change is minor, making D the correct answer.

I think I'm overcomplicating this. The correct answer is that λ2 is greater than λ1, so the options are A or D. Since the question doesn't give any specific ratio, the correct answer is that λ2 is greater than λ1. So among the options, the only ones that allow for that are A and D.

But since the problem states that the mean free path changed, the correct answer must be either A or D.

Given that, but I don't know the exact factor, perhaps the intended answer is that λ2 is greater than λ1, so the correct option is A) λ2 >=1.22λ1.

Wait, another thought: 1.22 is approximately sqrt( (4/π) ), which is about 1.128, but that's not correct. Alternatively, 1.22 is about 4/3.29, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the factor comes from the equation for the mean free path when considering the electron beam's effect.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is C) λ2 < λ1, but I can't see why.

I've spent a lot of time on this, but I'm going to conclude that the mean free path increases, so the correct options are A and D.

But since the problem doesn't provide the exact factor, perhaps the correct answer is that λ2 is larger than λ1, so the answer is either A or D.

But in the options, only A and D are possible.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is C) λ2 < λ1. How? Because the electron beam causes the gas molecules to collide more, perhaps increasing the scattering. But earlier reasoning said that the gas is being removed, making λ longer.

Hmm. I think I'm stuck, but I'll go with the conclusion that λ2 is greater than λ1, so the correct answer is either A or D. But since the options don't give a 'greater than' option, perhaps the intended answer is A) λ2 >=1.22λ1.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves determining the relationship between the mean free paths, λ1 and λ2, of gas molecules in a high-resolution transmission electron microscope operating under ultra-high vacuum conditions. Initially, Mike calculates the mean free path as λ1 based on the vacuum state. However, upon activating the electron beam, he observes a change in the mean free path to λ2. The key is to analyze how the electron beam affects the gas molecules and the resulting mean free path.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Mean Free Path Formula**: The mean free path λ is inversely proportional to the number density \( n \) and the collision cross-section \( \sigma \), given by:
   \[
   \lambda = \frac{1}{n \sigma \sqrt{2}}
   \]
   If \( n \) decreases, \( \lambda \) increases.

2. **Effect of the Electron Beam**:
   - The electron beam can ionize gas molecules, causing them to stick to the chamber walls or be expelled from the system. This reduces the number density \( n \), leading to an increase in \( \lambda \).
   - The problem specifies that the temperature remains constant, so changes in \( \lambda \) are due to changes in \( n \) or \( \sigma \).

3. **Observed Change**:
   - Mike observes that \( \lambda \) changes from \( \lambda_1 \) to \( \lambda_2 \). Since the gas density decreases due to the electron beam, \( \lambda_2 \) is expected to be greater than \( \lambda_1 \).

4. **Options Analysis**:
   - **Option A (\( \lambda_2 \geq 1.22 \lambda_1 \))**: This suggests a significant increase in \( \lambda \), possibly due to a substantial reduction in gas density.
   - **Option B (\( \lambda_2 = \lambda_1 \))**: This implies no change in \( \lambda \), which contradicts the observation that \( \lambda \) changes.
   - **Option C (\( \lambda_2 < \lambda_1 \))**: This implies a decrease in \( \lambda \), which is inconsistent with the reasoning that \( n \) decreases, increasing \( \lambda \).
   - **Option D (\( \lambda_1 < \lambda_2 < 1.22 \lambda_1 \))**: This suggests a moderate increase in \( \lambda \), but the problem does not provide enough information to confirm this specific range.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The electron beam reduces the gas density, leading to an increase in \( \lambda \). Therefore, \( \lambda_2 > \lambda_1 \). Among the options, both A and D are plausible, but the problem does not specify the exact magnitude of the change. The most reasonable conclusion is that \( \lambda_2 \) is greater than \( \lambda_1 \), and option A (\( \lambda_2 \geq 1.22 \lambda_1 \)) aligns with the expected significant increase.

ANSWER: A
