Okay, so I've got this physics problem about the quantum rotation-vibration model, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says that we have a diatomic molecule made of atoms X and Y. The molecule is in its fundamental state, and we need to find the momentum of a photon that, when absorbed, would switch the molecule to the next state with the lowest possible energy. The given parameters are the masses of X and Y, the bond length, and the angular frequency of vibration.

Hmm, I remember that in molecular spectroscopy, the energy transitions involve both rotational and vibrational states. But wait, the question specifies the quantum rotation-vibration model, also known as the non-rigid rotor model. So I think that model includes both rotation and vibration, treating the bond as slightly changeable with each vibration, hence non-rigid.

Wait, the fundamental state usually refers to the lowest energy state, which is the ground state. So if the molecule is in its fundamental state, that probably means it's in the ground vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (like J=0, or maybe J=1 depending on the rigid rotor model). But the question is about transitioning to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So what's the next possible state after the fundamental state?

I think in rotational-vibrational transitions, the molecule can absorb a photon that either changes the vibrational state or the rotational state. But the next lowest state might involve a change in either rotation or vibration. However, in the rigid rotor model, the energy levels are quantized and depend on J (rotational quantum number). For a diatomic, the energy levels for rotation are E_rot = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant. And for vibration, it's E_vib = (1/2) h w + h w v, where v is the vibrational quantum number.

Now, the fundamental state is v=0 and J=0, perhaps. The next possible states would be either increasing v by 1 or J by 1. But which transition requires less energy? Because the energy difference for rotation and vibration can vary.

Wait, the vibrational energy levels are usually more spaced out than rotational levels. Oh wait, no, actually, no. The spacing between rotational levels (B) depends on the moment of inertia and the rotational constant. Let me think: the rotational constant B is given by ħ²/(2 I), where I is the moment of inertia. The vibrational energy levels have spacing h w, while the rotational spacing between adjacent levels is roughly 2 B (since E_rot increases as J increases).

So which transition is lower in energy difference? It depends on the values of B and w.

Wait, but the question is about a photon causing a transition to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the photon should cause the transition with the least energy difference. So which transition is smaller in energy—the first rotational (J=0 → J=1) or the first vibrational (v=0 → v=1)?

Let me compute both energy differences.

First, let's calculate the vibrational energy change. The energy for vibration is E_vib = (1/2) h w + h w v. So the difference between v=0 and v=1 is ΔE_vib = h w (1 - 0) = h w. That's because the ground state is v=0, and the first excited vibrational state is v=1, so the energy difference is h w.

Next, the rotational energy change. For rotation, the energy levels are E_rot = B J (J+1). So from J=0 to J=1, the change is E_rot = B (1)(2) - B(0)(1) = 2 B. The energy difference is 2 B.

So which is smaller: 2 B or h w?

I need to compute B first. The rotational constant B is given by:

B = (h²) / (8 π² I)

where I is the moment of inertia. For a diatomic molecule, I = μ r², where μ is the reduced mass and r is the bond length.

So, let's compute μ. The masses are Mx=20 amu and My=2 amu.

Reduced mass μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My) = (20*2)/(20+2) = 40/22 ≈ 1.818 amu.

Converting amu to kg: 1 amu ≈ 1.66053906660e-27 kg. So μ = 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg ≈ let's calculate that.

1.8 * 1.66e-27 is roughly 2.988e-27 kg. But let's do it more accurately.

Wait, 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 = ?

1.818 * 1.6605 = Let me compute:

1.8 * 1.6605 = 2.9889, and 0.018 *1.6605 = ~0.0299. So total is about 3.0188e-27 kg.

Now, the bond length r is 2 angstroms. 1 angstrom is 1e-10 meters, so r=2e-10 m.

I = μ r² = 3.0188e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.0188e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.2075e-46 kg m².

Now, B = h² / (8 π² I). Let me recall that h is Planck's constant, approximately 6.62607015e-34 J s.

So h squared is (6.626e-34)^2 ≈ 4.39e-67 (J s)^2.

Compute denominator: 8 π² I = 8 * (9.8696) * 1.2075e-46.

8 * 9.8696 ≈ 78.9568. Multiply by 1.2075e-46: 78.9568 * 1.2075 ≈ let's see, 78.9568 *1.2 is ~94.748, so 78.9568 *1.2075 ≈ ~95.3e-46.

So denominator is ~95.3e-46 = 9.53e-45.

So B ≈ (4.39e-67) / (9.53e-45) )= approx 4.39e-67 / 9.53e-45.

Dividing exponents: 1e-67 /1e-45 = 1e-22.

4.39 /9.53 ≈ ~0.46. So B ≈ 0.46e-22 J.

Wait, that's 4.6e-23 J? Hmm, wait, let me double-check the calculation.

Wait, 4.39e-67 / 9.53e-45 = (4.39 /9.53) ) * 1e(-67 +45) )= 0.46 * 1e-22 = 4.6e-23 J.

Wait, but wait, the units: B has units of J, which is energy. But rotational energy levels are usually in cm^-1 or something, but okay.

Wait, but sometimes B is given in terms of cm^-1, but perhaps not here.

Wait, the energy spacing for rotation (from J=0 to J=1) is 2 B.

So ΔE_rot = 2 * 4.6e-23 J ≈ 9.2e-23 J.

Now, the vibrational energy difference is h w. h is 6.626e-34 J s, and w is 4e14 rad/s.

So ΔE_vib = 6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.65e-19 J.

So comparing the two:

ΔE_rot ≈ 9.2e-23 J

ΔE_vib ≈ 2.65e-19 J

So ΔE_rot is much smaller. So the molecule can undergo a rotational transition with less energy than a vibrational transition. So the next state with the lowest possible energy would be the next rotational state, J=1, where the molecule absorbs a photon that provides 2B energy.

Wait, but wait. The problem states that the molecule is in its fundamental state, which I think refers to the lowest possible energy state, which would be v=0, J=0.

So the next possible energy states are either v=1, J=0 or v=0, J=1. The question is asking for the photon that allows the molecule to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the photon should cause the transition with the least energy, which is the rotational one, since 2B is less than h w.

Therefore, the energy of the photon should be equal to 2B, which is 9.2e-23 J.

But wait, photons have energy E = h f = p c, where p is momentum and c is the speed of light. Or, since E = pc, p = E / c.

So the momentum p of the photon would be p = (2B) / c.

Wait, but let me make sure: for a photon, E = pc, so yes, p = E / c.

So plugging in the numbers.

E_photon = 2B = 9.2e-23 J.

c is approximately 3e8 m/s.

So p_photon = 9.2e-23 J / 3e8 m/s = 3.066e-31 kg m/s = 3.07e-31 kg m/s. Hmm, but wait, none of the options are anywhere near that. Let me check the options again.

Options are:

A) 1.9e-28 Ns → which is kg m/s (since 1 Ns = kg m/s)

Wait, because N = kg m/s², so Ns = kg m/s.

So each option is in kg m/s.

Wait, so my calculation for p is about 3e-31 kg m/s. But the options are around 1e-27 to 2e-27 kg m/s. That's way larger. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, I think I messed up the calculation of B. Let's go back step by step.

First, compute the reduced mass μ.

Mx is 20 amu, My is 2 amu.

μ = (20 *2) / (20+2) = 40/22 ≈ 1.818 amu.

Convert μ to kg: 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg = approximately 2.999e-27 kg.

Wait, 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 = let me compute 1 * 1.6605e-27 is 1.6605e-27, 0.8 * 1.6605e-27 is 1.3284e-27. 0.018 *1.6605e-27 is approx 3.0e-29. Adding 1.6605e-27 + 1.3284e-27 = 2.9889e-27, then +3e-29 gives about 3.0189e-27 kg. So yes, correct.

Bond length r = 2 angstroms = 2e-10 m.

Moment of inertia I = μ r² = 3.0189e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.0189e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.20756e-46 kg m².

Rotational constant B = h²/(8 π² I).

Compute h²: h is 6.626e-34 Js → h² is (6.626e-34)^2 = approx 4.39e-67 (J s)^2.

Denominator: 8 π² I = 8 * (π^2) * 1.20756e-46.

π^2 is about 9.8696.

So 8 * 9.8696 ≈ 78.9568.

78.9568 * 1.20756e-46 = approx 95.3e-46 = 9.53e-45.

So B = (4.39e-67) / (9.53e-45) = 4.39e-67 / 9.53e-45 ≈ 4.6e-23 J.

Wait, 4.39e-67 /9.53e-45 = (4.39 /9.53) * 1e(-67+45) ) → 0.46 * 1e-22 → 4.6e-23 J.

So, B is 4.6e-23 J.

The energy difference for rotation is 2B = 9.2e-23 J.

But wait, the photon's energy is 2B, so E_photon = 9.2e-23 J.

Then, the momentum p = E_photon / c.

c is 3e8 m/s.

p = 9.2e-23 J / 3e8 m/s = 3.0666e-31 kg m/s.

Hmm, but that's 3.07e-31 kg m/s, which is way smaller than any of the options. The options are in the 1e-28 Ns (which is the same as kg m/s) to 2e-27 kg m/s.

Wait, I must be doing something wrong here. Let me think again.

Wait a minute, perhaps the transition is a combination of both rotational and vibrational changes. Oh wait, maybe the question isn't just about rotational or vibrational, but a transition that includes both. But how?

Wait, the model is the non-rigid rotor model, which treats the bond as not rigid, so when the molecule vibrates, the bond length changes, affecting the moment of inertia. So perhaps the energy levels are a combination of rotation and vibration.

Wait, but I'm not too familiar with the non-rigid rotor model. Maybe it's better to think in terms of the rigid rotor plus vibration, but the problem says to model it using the quantum rotation-vibration model.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the fundamental state as the first state, and the next state is the next available state, which could be either a vibrational or rotational transition. But in terms of energy, the lower energy transition is the rotational one, so the photon would cause that.

But in that case, the p calculation gives me 3e-31 kg m/s, but none of the options are that low. So perhaps I made a mistake in considering the model.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the transition from the fundamental state (v=0, J=0) to the next state which is the combination of both—like J=1 and v=1. No, that would require more energy.

Wait, maybe I should consider the energy levels as a combination of both rotation and vibration. Let me recall that in the rotation-vibration coupling model, the energy levels can be treated as products of the rotational and vibrational energies.

Wait, no, more accurately, the energy is E = E_rot + E_vib. So when the photon is absorbed, it can cause a transition where either E_rot or E_vib increases, but not both necessarily.

But wait, the next state with the lowest possible energy would be the one requiring the least energy. So as earlier, the rotation transition requires less energy than the vibration, so the photon's energy should be for the rotation transition.

But the calculation doesn't match any of the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in calculating B.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the formula for the rotational energy. Let's double-check.

The rotational energy levels are given by E_rot = B J (J+1), where B = ħ²/(2I). Oh wait, earlier I used h instead of ħ. Because the formula I used is B = h²/(8 π² I), which is correct because h = 2 π ħ.

Yes, because ħ = h/(2 pi), so h = 2 pi ħ. So B can be written as:

B = ( (2 pi ħ )^2 ) / (8 pi^2 I) ) = (4 pi² ħ²) / (8 pi^2 I) ) = ( ħ² ) / (2 I )

So that's correct. So perhaps my initial calculation is right.

Wait, but perhaps the problem is referring to the next state with the lowest possible energy, which might be the first excited vibrational state, but that's a higher energy than the rotational transition. But why would the options not match?

Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to consider the transition from the ground state (v=0, J=0) to the first excited state (v=1, J=0), which would be a vibrational transition. Then the energy would be h w, and the photon's momentum p = (h w) / c.

Let me compute that.

h w = 6.626e-34 Js *4e14 rad/s = 2.650e-19 J.

p = E / c = (2.65e-19 J) / (3e8 m/s) = 8.83e-28 kg m/s.

Looking at the options, option A is 1.9e-28 kg m/s, which is close. But 8.83e-28 is higher than option A. So none of the options match that either.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the model. Another approach: the molecule is in the fundamental state (v=0, J=0), and the next possible state could be J=1, which is a rotational transition. The energy for that is 2B. So the photon's energy is 2B, and its momentum is (2B)/c.

Wait, let me compute 2B again.

Earlier I found B=4.6e-23 J, so 2B is 9.2e-23 J.

So p = 9.2e-23 /3e8 = ~3.07e-31 kg m/s.

But that's way smaller than any option provided. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of B. Let me recheck the numbers.

Wait, let's compute B again.

I = μ r².

μ is in kg, r in meters.

μ = (20*2)/(20+2) * 1.6605e-27 kg.

Yes, that's 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 = 3.0189e-27 kg.

r = 2e-10 m.

r² =4e-20 m².

I = 3.0189e-27 kg *4e-20 m² = 1.20756e-46 kg m².

h is 6.626e-34 Js.

h² = (6.626e-34)^2 = approx 4.39e-67 (J s)^2.

Denominator: 8 π² I = 8 * pi² *1.20756e-46.

Compute 8 * pi²: pi^2 is ~9.8696, so 8 *9.8696 = ~78.9568.

Multiply by I: 78.9568 *1.20756e-46 = 78.9568 * 1.20756 = let me compute that.

78 * 1.20756 = about 94.154.

0.9568 *1.20756 ≈ 1.155.

Total is about 95.309e-46.

So 8 pi² I = 95.309e-46 kg m².

So B = h² / (8 pi² I ) = 4.39e-67 /95.309e-46 = 4.39e-67 /9.5309e-45.

Which is approximately 4.39e-67 /9.53e-45 = (4.39 /9.53) * 1e-22 → ~0.46 *1e-22 = 4.6e-23 J.

So that's correct.

So back to the problem, if the photon's energy is 2B =9.2e-23 J, then p = 9.2e-23 /3e8 = 3.07e-31 kg m/s.

But that's way too small compared to the options given (which are up to 2.3e-27 kg m/s). So I'm definitely missing something here.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the photon causing a transition to a higher vibrational state, but that would require a higher energy, which doesn't fit the question.

Wait, another possibility is that the question is actually about the rotational transition but in terms of the energy levels that include the non-rigid rotor effect, which couples rotation and vibration. But I'm not sure how that would change the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is not about the energy difference but the angular momentum. Wait, the question asks for the momentum of the photon, which is p. Momentum of a photon is related to energy as p = E/c. So if the energy is 2B, then p is 2B/c.

Wait, but 2B is 9.2e-23 J, which divided by 3e8 m/s gives 3.07e-31 kg m/s, which is not matching any options.

Wait, looking at the options:

Options are:

A) 1.9e-28 kg m/s

B) 2.3e-27 kg m/s

C) 1.1e-27 kg m/s

D) 1.4e-28 kg m/s

Hmm, all are larger than the value I calculated. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation of B.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation of h squared. Let me recompute h squared.

h = 6.626e-34 J s.

h squared = (6.626e-34)^2 = (6.626)^2 * 1e-68.

6.626 squared is about 43.905.

So h squared is 43.905e-68 = 4.3905e-67 (J s)^2.

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of the moment of inertia? Let me check again.

I = μ r².

μ = (20 * 2) / (20 +2 ) amu.

=40/22 = 1.81818... amu.

Convert to kg: 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg = 3.018e-27 kg.

r = 2e-10 m.

r^2 = 4e-20 m².

I = 3.018e-27 kg *4e-20 m² = 1.2072e-46 kg m². Correct.

So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the model is considering the energy levels differently. For a diatomic molecule, the vibrational energy is quantized as E_vib = (n + ½) h w, where n is the vibrational quantum number (n=0,1,2,...). The ground state is n=0, first excited is n=1. So the energy difference between n=0 and n=1 is h w.

Similarly for rotational, the energy difference between J=0 and J=1 is 2B.

So, the photon's energy must match one of these, but the question is about the lowest possible energy transition. So if 2B is less than h w, then it's the rotational transition. But if h w is less than 2B, then it's the vibrational transition.

Wait, in our earlier calculation, h w is 2.65e-19 J, and 2B is 9.2e-23 J. So 2B is much smaller. So the photon's energy should be 2B.

But the photon's momentum is 3e-31 kg m/s, but the options don't have that. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe I messed up the formula for B. Wait, another formula for B is B = h/(8 pi² c^2 I) ?

No, wait. No, B is in energy units (Joules), so perhaps it's correct as I calculated.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of the reduced mass and whether I used the right formula.

Wait, another thought: the rotational constant B is often given in cm^-1, which is energy per particle. But perhaps the problem uses a different unit conversion.

Wait, no, I think the calculation is correct. So perhaps the problem is not about the rotational transition but the vibrational one.

If the photon's energy is h w = 2.65e-19 J, then p = 2.65e-19 /3e8 = 8.83e-28 kg m/s.

Looking at the options, option A is 1.9e-28, which is half of that.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of h w.

Wait, w is given as 4e14 rad/s.

h w = 6.626e-34 J s *4e14 rad/s = 2.6504e-19 J.

Yes, right.

So p = 2.6504e-19 /3e8 = 8.834e-28 kg m/s.

None of the options match that exactly, but option A is 1.9e-28, which is about half. Could I have made a mistake in the calculation?

Wait, perhaps I should compute 6.626e-34 *4e14:

6.626e-34 *4e14 = (6.626 *4) *1e(-34+14) = 26.504e-20 = 2.6504e-19 J.

Yes, that's correct.

So why is the calculated p not matching any options? Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is about the rotational transition, but I'm using the wrong energy. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the first transition, which is not necessarily the lowest possible. Or perhaps the next state is the first excited state, which could be a combination of rotation and vibration. But that's getting complicated.

Alternatively, maybe the model the question uses treats the molecule as a rigid rotor, but the bond length isn't changing. Wait, but the question says it's modeled with the quantum rotation-vibration model, which is the non-rigid rotor model.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the rotational energy difference. Wait, the energy levels for rotation are E_rot = B J (J+1). So the difference between J=0 (E=0) and J=1 (E=2B) is 2B. So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the transition from the ground state (v=0, J=0) to the first excited state (v=0, J=1), which is a rotational transition. So the photon's energy is 2B, which is 9.2e-23 J, but this gives a momentum of 3e-31 kg m/s.

But again, none of the options match this. So I'm stuck.

Wait, perhaps I should check the options again. Let's look at option C: 1.1e-27 kg m/s.

If E_photon = p * c = 1.1e-27 kg m/s *3e8 m/s = 3.3e-19 J.

Which would be similar to a vibrational transition, but in that case, h w is 2.65e-19 J, so 3.3e-19 is a bit higher than h w.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the transition to the next state in terms of the combination of both rotation and vibration. But I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think of the problem differently. The question says the molecule is in the fundamental state. In the context of molecular vibrations, the fundamental state refers to the lowest vibrational state (v=0). So the next state with the lowest energy would be the next vibrational state (v=1), because the rotational transitions are much lower in energy but perhaps the model allows for simultaneous transitions. Wait, but no, the vibrational transitions are higher.

Alternatively, perhaps the model in question combines both rotation and vibration into a single energy equation, but I'm not familiar enough with that.

Wait, another approach: the energy levels for a diatomic molecule in the rotation-vibration model can be written as E = E_rot + E_vib.

E_rot = B J (J+1)

E_vib = (1/2) h w + h w v.

The ground state is v=0, J=0. The next possible state is either v=1, J=0 or v=0, J=1. The energy required for v=1, J=0 is h w. For v=0, J=1, it's 2B. Since 2B is smaller than h w, the photon should have energy 2B, causing the J transition.

But again, that leads to p=3e-31, which isn't an option.

Wait, perhaps I'm supposed to calculate the photon's momentum for the vibrational transition, which would give p=8.83e-28 kg m/s, but that's not an option either.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of B. Let me recheck.

Wait, perhaps I mixed up the formula for B. Let me double-check.

The rotational constant B is given by:

B = (h^2) / (8 pi^2 I)

Wait, but sometimes it's expressed as B = ħ²/(2 I), which is the same thing because ħ = h/(2 pi).

Yes, because B = (h^2)/(8 pi^2 I) ) = ( (2 pi ħ)^2 )/(8 pi^2 I) ) = (4 pi^2 ħ^2)/(8 pi^2 I) ) ) = ( ħ^2 ) / (2 I )

So that's correct.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Since none of the options match the calculated values, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming which transition is allowed.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the model expects the photon to cause a transition from the ground state (v=0, J=0) to the first excited state, which is (v=1, J=0), which is a vibrational transition, but that requires h w energy, which would give p=8.8e-28 kg m/s. But none of the options match that.

Alternatively, perhaps the model considers the first transition as a combination of both, but that's unlikely. So maybe the problem is expecting the rotational transition, but the calculated p isn't matching any option. So perhaps I made a miscalculation in B.

Let me recompute B again.

I = μ r² = 3.0189e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.0189e-27 *4e-20 = 1.20756e-46 kg m².

B = h²/(8 pi² I) = (6.626e-34)^2 / (8 pi² *1.20756e-46 )

Compute numerator: 6.626e-34 squared is 4.39e-67.

Denominator: 8 pi^2 *1.20756e-46 = 8 * (9.8696) *1.20756e-46.

8 *9.8696 ≈78.9568.

78.9568 *1.20756e-46 = 78.9568 *1.20756 = approximately 95.3, so 95.3e-46 = 9.53e-45.

So B = 4.39e-67 /9.53e-45 = 4.39e-67 /9.53e-45 = (4.39/9.53) * 1e-22 = 0.46 *1e-22 =4.6e-23 J.

Wait, that's correct. So 2B is 9.2e-23 J.

But the photon's momentum is 3e-31 kg m/s, which isn't among the options.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the problem uses the rotational energy in terms of wavenumbers (cm^-1), but that would change nothing because h and c are accounted for.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the photon's energy as h w_rot, where w_rot is the angular frequency corresponding to the rotational transition. But rotational transitions have much lower frequencies than vibrational ones.

Wait, but the given problem states that the molecule is in the fundamental state, and we need the photon's momentum to switch to the next state. So perhaps the next state is the next allowed state, which is a combination of rotation and vibration. But I don't know the formula for that.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is considering the energy for a transition from J=0 to J=1, which is 2B, but with B calculated in the wrong way.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the moment of inertia. Let me recalculate I again.

μ = (20 amu * 2 amu) / (20 + 2 amu) = 40/(22) ≈ 1.818 amu.

Convert 1.818 amu to kg: 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg ≈ 3.018e-27 kg.

r = 2e-10 m.

I = μ r² = 3.018e-27 * (2e-10)^2 = 3.018e-27 *4e-20 = 1.207e-46 kg m².

Yes, that's correct.

So, perhaps the problem involves the photon's energy being the sum of the vibrational and rotational transitions. But that would be a much higher energy and larger p, which still doesn't match the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is referring to the vibrational transition but using the wrong energy.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the energy of the photon as the vibrational transition, which is h w, and then compute p as h w / c.

h w = 6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.65e-19 J.

p = 2.65e-19 /3e8 = 8.83e-28 kg m/s.

Looking at the options, the closest is option A (1.9e-28) and option D (1.4e-28). So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the harmonic oscillator model, where the energy levels are equally spaced. But in that case, the transition is h w.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the question is not about the energy difference but the angular momentum. The rotational state change would involve a change in angular momentum.

But angular momentum L = J ħ, so for J=1, L = ħ. But photons carry angular momentum p r, where r is the bond length. Wait, perhaps the photon's momentum should relate to the change in angular momentum.

But I'm not sure about that approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the formula for the photon's momentum as E/c, but perhaps c is taken as 3e8 m/s, which is correct.

Wait, but 3e8 m/s is the speed of light. So E_photon = p * c.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Let me look at the options again.

Options:

A) 1.9e-28 kg m/s.

If I compute p*c for option A: 1.9e-28 *3e8 =5.7e-20 J.

Which is much smaller than both 2B and h w.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the transition from J=0 to J=2, which would have a ΔE of 6B. But that would be 6*4.6e-23 = 2.76e-22 J. And p would be 9.2e-23 kg m/s, which is still way smaller than the options.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the rotational transition but using the wrong reduced mass. Maybe I used the wrong masses.

Wait, Mx is 20 amu, My is 2 amu. The reduced mass μ is (20 *2)/(20+2) =40/22=1.818 amu.

Yes, correct.

Wait, another idea: perhaps the problem is using the rigid rotor model, which ignores the vibration. But the question states that it's using the non-rigid model, so vibration is considered.

Wait, perhaps the problem actually expects the energy to be the sum of the rotational and vibrational transitions, but that would be higher than both, but the options don't match.

At this point, I'm not sure where the mistake is. But looking at the options, option C is 1.1e-27 kg m/s. Let's compute the energy for that.

E = p c = 1.1e-27 kg m/s * 3e8 m/s = 3.3e-19 J.

Which is higher than h w (2.65e-19 J). So perhaps the photon's energy is higher than the vibrational transition, which doesn't make sense for the next state.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the transition from J=0 to J=1 with vibrational transition v=0 to v=0, but that doesn't change anything.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the rotational energy in a different way, but without more information, I can't see where I'm going wrong.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is mixing up the mass. Let me check the masses again.

Mx is 20 amu, My is 2 amu. So yes, μ is 40/(22) amu.

Hmm, unless the problem is using the sum of the masses instead of the reduced mass. Let me try that.

If I use I = (Mx + My) r², which would be (22 amu) * (2e-10 m)^2.

But amu to kg: 22 amu =22 *1.6605e-27 kg =3.653e-26 kg.

I=3.653e-26 kg * (4e-20 m²) =1.461e-45 kg m².

Then B = h²/(8 pi² I) = 4.39e-67 / (8 pi² *1.461e-45 )

8 pi²=78.9568.

78.9568 *1.461e-45= 78.9568 *1.461 ≈ 115.17e-45 = 1.1517e-43.

So B=4.39e-67 /1.1517e-43 = 3.81e-24 J.

Then 2B=7.62e-24 J.

p=7.62e-24 /3e8=2.54e-32 kg m/s. Still way too small.

Hmm.

I think I'm stuck trying to find where the mistake is. All my calculations seem correct, but the given options don't align.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is option A, 1.9e-28 kg m/s, which is roughly half of the vibrational p.

But I can't see why that would be the case.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the transition. Maybe the question is considering the transition to the same vibration state but the next rotational state, but I thought that was what I was doing.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the transition to the first excited state (v=1) regardless of rotation. But that would require h w energy, leading to p=8.83e-28 kg m/s, which is option A: 1.9e-28. But 8.83e-28 is about four times option A.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the reduced mass in a different way. Wait, if I made a mistake in the calculation of μ, perhaps it's the sum of masses instead of the reduced mass. Let me compute that.

Sum of masses M =22 amu = 22*1.66e-27 kg=3.65e-26 kg.

I = M r²=3.65e-26 kg *4e-20 m²=1.46e-45 kg m².

Then B = (6.626e-34)^2 / (8 pi² *1.46e-45 )

h^2=4.39e-67.

Denominator:8 pi^2 I =8 pi^2 *1.46e-45= 78.9568 *1.46e-45= 1.15e-43.

So B=4.39e-67 / 1.15e-43=3.81e-24 J.

Then 2B=7.62e-24 J.

p=7.62e-24 /3e8=2.54e-32 kg m/s.

Still not matching options.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of B's units. Let me check.

Wait, B is in Joules. So E_rot = B J (J+1), which is in Joules. So that part is correct.

I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for similar problems.

Wait, I recall that the rotational energy levels are given by E = B J (J+1), where B = h²/(8 pi² I). So I think my approach is correct.

But given that none of the options match, perhaps the intended answer is option C, which is 1.1e-27 kg m/s. Let me compute what energy that corresponds to.

E_photon = p c =1.1e-27 kg m/s *3e8 m/s =3.3e-19 J.

Which is higher than h w (2.65e-19 J). So that's about 25% higher than the vibrational transition.

But that doesn't make sense for the 'next' state.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the first overtone, which would be v=2, but that's even higher.

I think I'm stuck, but perhaps the intended answer is option C. Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to take the vibrational transition, leading to option A.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the rotational transition but the calculation has a mistake. For example, perhaps I should have used the moment of inertia as (Mx * My) instead of the reduced mass.

Wait, no, because for a diatomic, the moment of inertia is μ r², not Mx My.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the photon's energy to be the sum of the rotational and vibrational energy differences.

ΔE =2B + h w =9.2e-23 +2.65e-19 J= 2.659e-19 J.

p=2.659e-19 /3e8= 8.86e-28 kg m/s.

But that's still not matching any options.

Wait, option A is 1.9e-28, which is about 1/5th of my calculated vibrational p.

But without any more ideas, perhaps I should make an educated guess. Based on the earlier calculation, the vibrational transition requires p=8.83e-28 kg m/s, which is not an option, but option A is 1.9e-28, which is roughly a quarter of that. Could I have made a mistake in the calculation of h?

Wait, perhaps I should double-check the value of h.

h is 6.62607015e-34 J s. Yes.

w is 4e14 rad/s.

h w =6.626e-34 *4e14 =2.6504e-19 J.

p=2.65e-19 /3e8=8.83e-28 kg m/s.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the photon's momentum to be equal to the vibrational angular momentum. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the photon's wavelength. But I don't see how that would help.

At this point, I'm not making progress, so I think I should make an educated guess. Since option A is 1.9e-28 kg m/s, which is about a fifth of the calculated vibrational p, perhaps I made a mistake in calculations.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of h w. Let me recompute h w.

h=6.626e-34 J s.

w=4e14 rad/s.

h w =6.626e-34 *4e14 = (6.626 *4) *1e(-34+14) → 26.504e-20 = 2.6504e-19 J.

Yes, correct.

So p=2.65e-19 /3e8=8.83e-28 kg m/s. So the closest option is A, but it's about four times smaller.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a different value for c. For example, c=3e8 m/s is correct, but perhaps the problem uses c=3e6 cm/s or another unit.

Wait, no, c=3e8 m/s is correct.

Hmm.

I think I'm stuck. Based on the calculations, the correct p for the vibrational transition is about 8.8e-28 kg m/s, which isn't an option. So perhaps the intended answer is option A, 1.9e-28, but I can't reconcile it with calculations. Alternatively, perhaps the intended answer is option C, 1.1e-27, but that doesn't align either.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is using the rotational energy in terms of cm^-1, but I don't see how that would change the momentum calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the problem expects the photon to cause a transition to the next state, which could be a combination of rotation and vibration, but without more information, I can't proceed.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is a trick question, and the correct answer is option A, but I can't see why.

In the end, I think the intended answer is option A, but I can't figure out why.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves a diatomic molecule modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration (non-rigid rotor) model. The molecule is in its fundamental state (v=0, J=0), and the goal is to determine the momentum of a photon required to transition to the next state with the lowest possible energy. The given parameters are the masses of the atoms (Mx = 20 amu, My = 2 amu), the bond length (r = 2 Å), and the angular frequency of vibration (ω = 4 × 10¹⁴ rad/s).

### Key Analysis:
1. **Energy Transitions**:
   - The molecule can transition either to the next rotational state (J=1) or the next vibrational state (v=1). The energy differences for these transitions are:
     - **Rotational transition**: ΔE_rot = 2B, where B is the rotational constant.
     - **Vibrational transition**: ΔE_vib = hω.

2. **Rotational Constant (B)**:
   - The rotational constant is calculated as:
     \[
     B = \frac{h^2}{8\pi^2 I}, \quad I = \mu r^2
     \]
     where \( \mu \) is the reduced mass:
     \[
     \mu = \frac{M_x M_y}{M_x + M_y} = \frac{20 \cdot 2}{20 + 2} \, \text{amu} = 1.818 \, \text{amu}.
     \]
     Converting \( \mu \) to kg:
     \[
     \mu = 1.818 \cdot 1.6605 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg} \approx 3.018 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}.
     \]
     The bond length \( r = 2 \, \text{Å} = 2 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m} \), so:
     \[
     I = \mu r^2 = (3.018 \times 10^{-27}) \cdot (2 \times 10^{-10})^2 = 1.20756 \times 10^{-46} \, \text{kg} \cdot \text{m}^2.
     \]
     Substituting into the formula for \( B \):
     \[
     B = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})^2}{8\pi^2 \cdot 1.20756 \times 10^{-46}} \approx 4.6 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}.
     \]
     The energy difference for the rotational transition is:
     \[
     \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = 2B = 9.2 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}.
     \]

3. **Vibrational Transition**:
   - The energy difference for the vibrational transition is:
     \[
     \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = h\omega = (6.626 \times 10^{-34}) \cdot (4 \times 10^{14}) = 2.65 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}.
     \]

4. **Comparison of Energy Differences**:
   - The rotational transition requires \( \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = 9.2 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \), while the vibrational transition requires \( \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = 2.65 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \). Since \( \Delta E_{\text{rot}} \ll \Delta E_{\text{vib}} \), the next state with the lowest energy corresponds to the rotational transition.

5. **Photon Momentum**:
   - The momentum of the photon is related to its energy by \( p = \frac{E}{c} \), where \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \). For the rotational transition:
     \[
     p = \frac{\Delta E_{\text{rot}}}{c} = \frac{9.2 \times 10^{-23}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 3.07 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{kg} \cdot \text{m/s}.
     \]
     This value is orders of magnitude smaller than any of the provided options, suggesting a possible issue with the interpretation of the question or the options.

6. **Vibrational Transition Momentum**:
   - For completeness, the momentum of the photon for the vibrational transition is:
     \[
     p = \frac{\Delta E_{\text{vib}}}{c} = \frac{2.65 \times 10^{-19}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 8.83 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{kg} \cdot \text{m/s}.
     \]
     This value is closest to option **A** (\( 1.9 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{kg} \cdot \text{m/s} \)), but it is still significantly smaller.

### Conclusion:
The calculations suggest that the rotational transition requires much less energy than the vibrational transition. However, none of the provided options match the calculated values for either transition. Based on the vibrational transition being the next plausible option, the closest match is **A**, but this does not align well with the calculations.

Answer: A
