Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky, particularly how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

Alright, parallax is the apparent shift in the position of a star relative to more distant stars as observed from Earth's orbit. The formula I remember is that the distance to a star is inversely proportional to its parallax. So, distance d = 1/plx, where plx is the parallax in parsecs. Right, because 1 parsec is the distance where 1 AU subtends 1 arcsecond.

Now, the question says stars are uniformly distributed. Wait, uniform distribution usually means that the number density is constant in space. So the number of stars per unit volume is the same everywhere. But how does that translate into parallax terms?

Let me think about volume. Since the stars are uniformly distributed, the number of stars in a spherical shell of radius r and thickness dr would be proportional to the surface area of the shell (4πr²) multiplied by the thickness dr. So the number of stars N in dr is proportional to 4π r² dr.

But since we're dealing with parallax and distance, let's express everything in terms of parallax (plx). Oh, right, because plx = 1/d. So d = 1/plx, which means as plx increases, the star is closer, and as plx decreases, the star is farther away.

So the number of stars in a certain range of parallax would depend on how the volume element changes with distance. Let's take a small change in parallax, say d plx. What is the corresponding change in distance?

If plx = 1/d, then d = 1/plx. Taking the derivative, dd = (1/plx²) d plx. Wait, so when plx changes by d plx, the distance changes by approximately d plx / plx². Hmm, but how does this relate to the volume? 

Wait, the number of stars between plx and plx + d plx would correspond to the number of stars in the shell between d and d + dd. So the volume of the shell is 4π d² dd. Since N is proportional to this, N ∝ 4π d² dd.

But using d = 1/plx, substituting gives d² = 1/plx², and dd = d plx / plx². Wait wait, no, because d plx would be a small change, so I think it's better to express in terms of plx. Let me try again:

d plx is the small change in parallax. Since d = 1/plx, the distance change dd = d plx / plx^2. Because dd is (d/d plx) * d plx = (1/plx^2) d plx.

So the volume element, which is 4π d² dd, becomes 4π (1/plx²) * (d plx/(plx²)).

So that's 4π * (1/plx²) * (d plx / plx²) ) = 4π (d plx) / plx^4.

So the number of stars in a small change in plx is proportional to (d plx) / plx^4. Therefore, the number per unit plx (i.e., per d plx) is proportional to 1/plx^4.

Wait, but the question is about the number of stars per unit range of plx. So if I have a small range d plx, N = (proportional to) (d plx)/(plx^4). So the number per unit plx (d plx=1) is proportional to 1/plx^4.

But wait, no. Because when you have N per unit plx, you take the derivative. The number per unit plx (d plx) would be the number in d plx divided by d plx. So N/(d plx) = (4π d² dd) )/(d plx). Hmm, but I'm getting confused.

Alternative approach: The number of stars per unit volume is n, a constant. The number in a volume dV is n dV. So dV is the volume between d and d+dd.

dV = 4π d² dd. So the number is n * 4π d² dd.

But d is related to plx. So d = 1/plx, so dd = - (1/plx^2) d plx. Wait, plx is decreasing as d increases, so when plx increases (from plx to plx + d plx), d decreases. But perhaps for the sake of this calculation, we can take the magnitude.

So substituting d = 1/plx, dd = (d plx) / plx^2.

So N = n * 4π (1/plx^2) * (d plx / plx^2) ) = n * 4π (d plx) / plx^4.

So N is proportional to (d plx) / plx^4. Therefore, when you look at N per unit plx (i.e., d plx = 1), it's proportional to 1/plx^4.

Wait, but the question is asking how the number changes with plx. So the number per unit plx is proportional to 1/(plx^4), which would be option A.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't mix up anything. Another way to think: the number of stars per unit distance is constant (since uniform). But the number per unit parallax would depend on how the volume changes with plx.

Alternatively, the volume between plx and plx + d plx is the volume between d and d + dd.

But again, I think my initial approach holds. So the number per unit plx is proportional to 1/plx^4, so the answer should be option A.

To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we start by noting that stars are uniformly distributed in space, meaning the number density of stars is constant. The number of stars in a spherical shell of radius \( r \) and thickness \( dr \) is proportional to the surface area of the shell (\( 4\pi r^2 \)) multiplied by the thickness \( dr \). Thus, the number of stars \( N \) in \( dr \) is proportional to \( 4\pi r^2 dr \).

Parallax \( \text{plx} \) is inversely related to distance \( d \) as \( \text{plx} = 1/d \), so \( d = 1/\text{plx} \). For a small change in parallax \( d\text{plx} \), the corresponding change in distance is \( dd = (d\text{plx})/\text{plx}^2 \). Substituting \( d = 1/\text{plx} \) into the volume element \( 4\pi d^2 dd \), we get:

\[
dV = 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2}\right) \left(\frac{d\text{plx}}{\text{plx}^2}\right) = 4\pi \frac{d\text{plx}}{\text{plx}^4}.
\]

The number of stars in this volume is proportional to \( N \propto 4\pi \frac{d\text{plx}}{\text{plx}^4} \). To find the number of stars per unit range of parallax, we divide \( N \) by \( d\text{plx} \), yielding:

\[
\frac{N}{d\text{plx}} \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4}.
\]

Thus, the number of stars per unit range of parallax decreases as \( \sim 1/\text{plx}^4 \).
