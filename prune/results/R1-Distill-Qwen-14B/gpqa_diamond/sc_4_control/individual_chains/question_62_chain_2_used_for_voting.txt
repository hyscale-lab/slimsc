Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The goal is to synthesize 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde from ethynylcyclohexane. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me break it down.

First, I need to figure out what the target molecule looks like. The name is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So, the main structure is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, which means there's an aldehyde group attached to a cyclohexane ring. Then, at position 1, there's a substituent which is a methyl group attached to both cyclohexyl and a hydroxyl group. So the substituent is -(cyclohexyl)(OH)CH2- attached to the cyclohexane ring where the aldehyde is.

Wait, alternatively, maybe it's cyclohexyl attached to a CH2OH group, and that CH2OH is attached to the cyclohexane ring where the aldehyde is. Either way, the substituent is a -CH2-OH with a cyclohexyl group attached.

So the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. That's a cyclohexane ring with an ethynyl group (a triple bond to a CH2 group, maybe? Or wait, ethynyl is C≡C-CH2- attached to the ring? No, wait, ethynyl should be -C≡CH, right? So ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane with a triple bond substituent: like cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH? Or is it cyclohexane with a C≡C-CH2- group? Wait, no, ethynyl is the substituent. So ethynylcyclohexane would be cyclohexane with a -C≡CH group attached. So it's CH2-C≡CH attached to the cyclohexane.

I think I need to plan the steps to get from ethynylcyclohexane to the target molecule.

Let me think about the possible reactions. The target molecule has two main parts: an aldehyde group and a substituent that's a cyclohexylmethyl with a hydroxyl group. So maybe the synthesis involves adding groups and oxidizing.

Looking at the options, the reagents involve things like NaNH2, which is a strong base, maybe for elimination or deprotonation. Methyl chloride (CH3Cl) might be a methylating agent. H2 with a catalyst like Pd is hydrogenation. Ba(OH)2 is for elimination, perhaps. H2SO4 and HgSO4 are for oxidation, like the Jones oxidation. O3 is ozone, which is used in ozonolysis. NH4OH is ammonium hydroxide, which might be used in workups, like after ozonolysis.

So let's think about the steps needed.

The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane (cyclohexane with a -C≡CH group). I need to get to a cyclohexane ring with an aldehyde and a substituent that's cyclohexyl-CH2-OH attached.

Wait, perhaps the ethynyl group can be transformed into something else. Let's think about the triple bond being converted into a carbonyl group. Ozonolysis of triple bonds gives diketones, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, hydrogenation could add H's.

Wait, perhaps the ethynyl group can be hydrogenated to a cis double bond, but then further reactions could happen.

Alternatively, maybe the ethynyl group is transformed into a ketone or aldehyde.

Wait, maybe the synthesis involves the formation of a benzyl-type carbocation, but I'm not sure.

Let me think about the target structure. The substituent is (cyclohexyl)(hydroxy)methyl. So that's a CH2 group attached to both a cyclohexyl group and an OH group.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH(OH)CH2 group or something like that. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the ethynyl group can be converted into an aldehyde. Let me think: ethynylcyclohexane would have a -C≡CH group. If I hydrogenate that, using H2 and a catalyst like Pd, that would add H's across the triple bond, leading to a cis double bond or perhaps a single bond. Wait, hydrogenation of a triple bond (alkyne) with H2 and a catalyst (like Lindlar's for cis addition, or with a poison like quinoline for trans). Wait, but if I use H2 with Pd without any poison, it would hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond, making it a CH2CH2 group? Wait, no, ethynyl would be -C≡CH. Adding H2 across the triple bond would make it -CH2CH2-, but that's ethane, so the substituent would be -CH2CH2- attached to the ring? Wait, no, ethynyl is -C≡C-CH2- attached to the ring. No, wait, ethynyl is -C≡CH, so the structure is:

cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH.

Wait, no, ethynyl is the group where the triple bond is substituent. So ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH? Or is it cyclohexane with a C≡C-CH3 group? Wait, no, ethynyl is -C≡CH. So the structure is cyclohexane with a -CH2-C≡CH group attached? Or is it cyclohexane with a direct C≡CH substituent? Hmm, perhaps the structure is cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH.

Wait, no, that's 1-ethynylcyclohexane. So the substituent is a -C≡CH group attached to the cyclohexane.

Now, the target molecule has a substituent that's a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group attached to the cyclohexane. So perhaps I need to introduce a cyclohexyl group and an OH group on a CH2 group attached to the main cyclohexane.

Another approach: perhaps the ethynyl group can be used to form a ring. For example, under certain conditions, the triple bond can undergo cyclization. Alternatively, maybe the ethynyl group is converted into a ketone, which can then undergo some kind of aldehyde formation.

Alternatively, maybe the ethynyl group is converted into an aldehyde group. How?

Wait, another thought: the triple bond can be oxidized. Ozonolysis of triple bonds typically breaks them into carbonyl groups. So if I ozonolyse ethynylcyclohexane, which is cyclohexane with a -C≡CH group, I might get a diketone. Wait, no, ozonolysis is for alkenes, not alkynes, unless it's a specific type. Wait, ozonolysis of internal alkynes can give diketones? Or perhaps ozonolysis of terminal alkynes gives a carbonyl group.

Wait, I'm not too confident about this. Let me think: Ozonolysis of an alkyne. For an internal alkyne, ozonolysis might give two carbonyl groups. For a terminal alkyne, like -C≡CH, ozonolysis would possibly give a ketone? Or a carboxylic acid? Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe I can use a different method to oxidize the triple bond. For example, using O3 followed by reductive workup or oxidative workup.

Wait, perhaps the triple bond can be converted into a carbonyl group. So for ethynylcyclohexane, if I oxidize the triple bond, I could get a ketone or an aldehyde.

Wait, the target molecule has an aldehyde group, so maybe that's from the oxidation of a terminal alkyne. So if I oxidize the -C≡CH group to a -COOH group, but then I would need to reduce it to an aldehyde. That sounds a bit complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is hydrogenated to a cis double bond, then subjected to some dihydroxylation or epoxidation, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the triple bond is hydrogenated to a cis double bond, and then we can perform some kind of cyclopropane formation, but that's probably not the case here.

Alternatively, maybe the ethynyl group is converted into an enol ether, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the target molecule has a cyclohexane ring with an aldehyde group and a substituent that has a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group attached to a CH2. So perhaps the substituent is a secondary alcohol attached to a cyclohexane ring. So maybe the substituent is a cyclohexylmethyl alcohol.

Wait, maybe the ethynyl group is first converted into an aldehyde, then through some aldehyde chemistry, perhaps a Grignard reaction, but that's speculative.

Let me think about the possible reagents in the options.

Looking at the options, the first step is NaNH2 and some chloride (either methyl or ethyl). NaNH2 is a strong base, used for deprotonation. So maybe it's used for a dehydrohalogenation or for elimination.

Wait, NaNH2 is often used in dehydrohalogenation to form alkenes, especially when reacting with a vicinal dihalide. Alternatively, it's used to deprotonate compounds to form strong bases, like in the Birch reduction or for elimination reactions.

So looking at the first step: if the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane (which is cyclohexane with a -C≡CH group), and the first reagent is NaNH2 and methyl chloride, perhaps this is a methylation step.

Wait, methyl chloride is CH3Cl. So if I have a base like NaNH2, maybe it's abstracting a proton, but where? Alternatively, NaNH2 can act as a base to deprotonate a compound, leading to an elimination reaction.

Wait, but the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. Maybe under the influence of NaNH2, some kind of deprotonation occurs, perhaps at the alkyne's terminal hydrogen. Because the terminal hydrogen of an alkyne is acidic, with a pKa around 25. NaNH2 has a strong base (NH2-), so it can deprotonate the alkyne.

So step 1: NaNH2 and CH3Cl. Wait, but CH3Cl is a methylating agent. So perhaps after deprotonation, the alkyne becomes a lithium or sodium salt, which can then react with CH3Cl to form a methyl group.

Wait, maybe it's a two-step process. Let me think again. NaNH2 is a strong base, and in presence of a methyl chloride, perhaps it's a methylation at the alkyne's terminal.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let's think about the possible reactions. If I have ethynylcyclohexane and I treat it with NaNH2, perhaps it deprotonates the alkyne, giving a cyclohexylacetylide. Then, adding methyl chloride (CH3Cl) would methylate the acetylide. So the acetylide would attack the methyl chloride, giving cyclohexylacetylide methylated, which would be cyclohexyl-CH2-C≡C-CH3?

Wait, wait. Ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane with a -C≡CH group. Deprotonating with NaNH2 would give cyclohexylacetylide (with the structure R-C≡C^- Na^+). Then, adding CH3Cl would lead to an alkylation: R-C≡C^- + CH3Cl → R-C≡C-CH2Cl + NaCl? Or maybe R-C≡C-CH2Cl? Wait, but that's not correct. The acetylide would attack the methyl chloride as a nucleophile.

Wait, the acetylide is a strong base and a good nucleophile. So methyl chloride would react with it: the methyl group would substitute the chloride. So R-C≡C^- + CH3Cl → R-C≡C-CH3 + Cl^- ?

Wait, no. Wait, the acetylide is R-C≡C^-, which would attack the CH3Cl, so the chloride leaves, and the methyl group adds to the acetylide. So the product would be R-C≡C-CH3. So the alkyne becomes R-C≡C-CH3, a propargyl group.

So after step 1, the molecule would be methylpropargylcyclohexane? So the structure would be cyclohexane with a -CH2-C≡C-CH3 group. Hmm, but that's a longer chain.

Wait, alternatively, maybe the reaction is forming a new carbon-carbon bond. So ethynylcyclohexane (cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH) treated with NaNH2 and CH3Cl would become cyclohexane-CH2-C≡C-CH3? So that's a longer chain. But I'm not sure if that helps in forming the target molecule.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step is a deprotonation and elimination. For example, if the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane, and after treatment with NaNH2 and CH3Cl, perhaps a Grignard-like reaction happens, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps the first step is a dehydrohalogenation, but I don't see a halide in the starting material. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the first reagent is for a elimination reaction, producing a double bond. So if the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane, perhaps under NaNH2, it forms a trans double bond via elimination. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: looking at the target molecule, it has an aldehyde group. So perhaps the alkyne is converted into an aldehyde. So how?

One way to make an aldehyde from an alkyne is through hydroboration-oxidation, but that usually gives ketones. Alternatively, ozonolysis of an alkyne.

Wait, Ozonolysis of a terminal alkyne (like -C≡CH) can give a carbonyl group. For example, ozonolysis of ethynylbenzene would give benzaldehyde. So perhaps in this case, the ethynylcyclohexane would, after ozonolysis, become cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, which is part of the target molecule.

But then we have more steps to add the substituent.

So let's think: Perhaps the first step is to make an aldehyde from the ethynyl group.

So step 1: Ozonolysis of ethynylcyclohexane, but looking at the options, I don't see O3 in the first step. So perhaps that's not the first step.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is hydrogenated to a cis double bond, then subjected to hydration to form a ketone, but that might not give an aldehyde.

Wait, another thought: Maybe we can form a benzyl-type compound. For example, using a strong base like NaNH2 to deprotonate the alkyne, then perform a coupling reaction.

Wait, perhaps the first step is a deprotonation and alkylation. So ethynylcyclohexane is treated with NaNH2 and methyl chloride, leading to the substitution of the terminal H with a methyl group. So the triple bond becomes -C≡C-CH3. Then, perhaps the next step is hydrogenation of the triple bond.

Looking at option C, the steps are: NaNH2, methyl chloride; then H2/Pd-calcium carbonate; then O3 with (CH3)2S; then Ba(OH)2.

Wait, let me think. So after step 1, the alkyne becomes -C≡C-CH3. Then step 2 is hydrogenation with H2 and Pd. That would convert the triple bond into a single bond, so the group becomes -CH2-CH2-CH3. But that doesn't seem helpful for making an aldehyde.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is hydrogenated to a cis or trans double bond. Wait, but with H2 and Pd, that would hydrogenate the triple bond into a single bond. So the triple bond (C≡C) becomes a single bond (C-C), giving a longer chain. So ethynylcyclohexane becomes cyclohexane with a -CH2-CH2-CH3 group attached?

Wait, but the target molecule has a cyclohexane ring with an aldehyde and a substituent. So perhaps after hydrogenation, we have some other steps.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a ketone. Let me think of another approach.

Wait, another reaction: the alkyne can be converted into a Grignard reagent. But I'm not sure if that's applicable here.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step is to perform a dehydrohalogenation. But again, I'm not seeing a halide in the starting material.

Wait, let me look at the target molecule again. It's 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So the substituent is a CH2 group attached to a cyclohexyl group and an OH group. So the structure is cyclohexane with a CH2OH and a CH2-cyclohexyl group attached.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is formed via a nucleophilic substitution or elimination reaction. But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, maybe the alkyne is first converted into a carbonyl group (like a ketone or aldehyde) and then undergoes some kind of aldehyde chemistry.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a carbonyl group via oxidation. Like using O3 followed by something else.

Wait, let me think about the reagents in the options.

Option C: step 3 is O3 and (CH3)2S. That's probably a reductive workup after ozonolysis. So step 3 would break double bonds into carbonyl groups.

Option D has NaNH2 and methanol as the first step. Maybe that's a deprotonation followed by something else.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is as follows:

1. The ethynyl group is first converted into a vinylic group via hydrogenation. So using H2 and Pd, the triple bond becomes a double bond (cis or trans, depending on catalyst). But looking at the options, the first steps vary.

Wait, looking again, target molecule has an aldehyde and a substituent with a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group. So maybe the ethynyl group is used to make the aldehyde part, and the substituent is formed via another process.

Alternatively, let's think about each option:

Option A: Steps are NaNH2/methylCl, then H2/Pd, then Ba(OH)2, then H2SO4/HgSO4/H2O.

Hmm, Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, used in elimination reactions, perhaps for forming epoxides or rings. H2SO4 and HgSO4 are for oxidation, like oxidizing alcohols to ketones or carboxylic acids.

But I'm not sure how that would fit.

Option B: Steps are NaNH2/ethylCl, then Li/liq NH3, then O3/H2O, then NH4OH.

Li and liquid NH3 is for Birch reductions, or for elimination (like dehydrohalogenation). O3 is ozonolysis, NH4OH is a workup.

Option C: Steps are NaNH2/MeCl, H2/Pd-CaCO3, O3/ (CH3)2S, Ba(OH)2.

Option D: NaNH2/methanol, Li/liq NH3, O3/ (CH3)2S, NH4OH.

Hmm.

Let me try to think through each option.

Option B: First step would be NaNH2 and ethylCl. So deprotonate the alkyne, then ethylate. So the alkyne becomes -C≡C-Et. Then step 2 is Li in liquid NH3. Li in NH3 is a strong base, used for eliminations. It could deprotonate and eliminate, forming a double bond. So the triple bond becomes a double bond. Then step 3 is ozonolysis, which would break the double bond into carbonyls. And step 4 is NH4OH, which is a workup, perhaps to reduce any ozonides to aldehydes.

Wait, if step 2 converts the alkyne into a double bond, then ozonolysis of that double bond would break it into two carbonyl groups.

Let me model this.

Starting with ethynylcyclohexane (R-C≡CH), step 1: NaNH2 and ethylCl would convert the alkyne to R-C≡C-Et. Then step 2: Li/NH3 would eliminate two groups, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, Li in NH3 could cause dehydrohalogenation if there's a leaving group, but I don't see one. Alternatively, perhaps Li in NH3 would cause the alkyne to undergo an internal reaction, maybe forming a ring or a double bond.

Wait, perhaps step 2 is elimination of HCl from a chlorinated compound, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, I'm getting stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps step 2 is a reduction. No, Li in NH3 is more about eliminations or reductions (like in the Birch reduction for aromatic rings, but that's not the case here).

Hmm, perhaps I should consider option C.

Option C: Step 1 is NaNH2 and methylCl. So the alkyne becomes R-C≡C-Me. Step 2 is H2 with Pd-CaCO3. So that would hydrogenate the triple bond into a single bond, making R-CH2-CH2-Me. Then step 3 is O3 with (CH3)2S. Ozonolysis of a single bond? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps step 2 produces a double bond, which then is ozonolyzed.

Wait, let me re-examine. After step 1: R-C≡C-Me. Step 2 is H2/Pd-CaCO3. That would hydrogenate the triple bond into a single bond, so structure becomes R-CH2-CH2-Me. Then step 3: O3 and (CH3)2S. Ozonolysis is for double bonds, but if the molecule has a single bond, how would that work?

Alternatively, perhaps step 2 doesn't hydrogenate to a single bond but to a cis or trans double bond. Wait, if the alkyne is hydrogenated under specific conditions, maybe it becomes a cis or trans double bond. For example, using H2 with Lindlar's catalyst would give cis, while with a poisoned catalyst gives trans. But Pd without poison usually gives cis.

So after step 1, the alkyne is R-C≡C-Me. Step 2: H2 and Pd would hydrogenate the triple bond to a cis double bond: R-CH2-CH2-Me? No, wait, the alkyne is R-CH2-C≡C-Me, or R-C≡C-CH2-Me? No, original structure is R-C≡C-H. After step 1, it's R-C≡C-Me. Then hydrogenation would add H2 across the triple bond to make R-CH2-CH2-Me. So the molecule becomes R-CH2-CH2-Me. But then step 3 is ozonolysis, which requires a double bond.

Wait, that doesn't make sense. So perhaps step 2 is not hydrogenation but something else.

Alternatively, maybe step 2 is a hydrogenation that stops at the double bond, so the triple bond becomes a double bond. So R-C≡C-Me becomes R-CH2-C=CH2-Me? No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should think about the target molecule again.

The target is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So it has two cyclohexane rings. One ring has the aldehyde group, and the substituent is a CH2 group attached to both a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group.

So perhaps the substituent comes from a cyclohexyl group attached to the main ring via a CH2 group, which also has an OH group.

Wait, maybe the substituent is formed by some kind of alkylation or addition reaction.

Another idea: The target molecule has a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH2OH group. So perhaps a Grignard reagent is added to the aldehyde to form a secondary alcohol.

Wait, but the aldehyde is on the main ring. So perhaps the aldehyde is formed first, then a Grignard reaction adds a cyclohexyl group to form the CH2OH substituent.

But how would that happen?

Alternatively, perhaps the ethynyl group is converted into an aldehyde, and then an elimination or addition occurs to form the substituent.

Wait, perhaps the ethynyl group is first converted into a carbonyl group (like an aldehyde) via oxidation, then the aldehyde is subjected to a reaction that adds a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group.

Wait, but how to get the cyclohexyl group attached.

Hmm, another approach: the target molecule has a cyclohexane ring with an aldehyde and a substituent that's a cyclohexyl-CH(OH)- group.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is formed via a nucleophilic substitution. For example, if the main ring has a good leaving group, like a bromide, and then a cyclohexyl group is introduced via an SN2 reaction, but that's speculative.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is formed through a conjugate addition or some kind of cyclopropane opening, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence of reagents involves forming the aldehyde and then introducing the substituent via an addition reaction.

Another thought: Maybe the alkyne is converted into a ketone via oxidation, then reduced to an aldehyde. But I'm not sure about the exact steps.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethynyl group is first hydrogenated to a cis double bond, then that double bond is epoxidized, then opened to form a diol, which can be further oxidized or something. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the steps involve:

1. Convert the alkyne to a ketone via some oxidation.
2. Perform a cyclopropanation or ring-opening.
3. Introduce the substituent with the cyclohexyl and OH groups.

But I'm not getting anywhere with that.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C.

Looking at option C: Steps are NaNH2, methylCl; then H2/Pd-CaCO3; then O3 with (CH3)2S; then Ba(OH)2.

So let's model this:

Starting with ethynylcyclohexane (R-C≡CH).

Step 1: NaNH2 and CH3Cl → R-C≡C-Me (methyl group added to the alkyne).

Step 2: H2/Pd-CaCO3 → hydrogenate the triple bond to single bond: R-CH2-CH2-Me.

Wait, but then how does that lead to an aldehyde?

Alternatively, maybe step 2 is hydrogenation to a cis double bond. So R-C≡C-Me becomes R-CH2-C=CH2-Me? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, if the triple bond is R-C≡C-Me, hydrogenation could convert it into R-CH2-CH2-Me. But then what's the next step?

Step 3: O3 with (CH3)2S. Ozonolysis is for double bonds. But in this case, after step 2, the molecule has a single bond. So perhaps step 2 is not hydrogenation but something else.

Wait, maybe I'm wrong about step 2. If the triple bond is R-C≡C-Me, and step 2 is hydrogenation with H2 and Pd, that would fully hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond, making R-CH2-CH2-Me.

Then step 3: Ozonolysis with (CH3)2S. But that's for breaking double bonds. So perhaps this isn't the right option.

Alternatively, perhaps step 2 is a different reaction. Maybe it's not hydrogenation but something else. Alternatively, maybe the triple bond is converted into a carbonyl group.

Wait, another thought: Step 2 could be a dihydroxylation, but I don't think H2/Pd does that. Dihydroxylation is usually done with OsO4 or other reagents.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.

Let me try to think about each step in option C:

1. R-C≡CH → NaNH2, CH3Cl → R-C≡C-Me.

2. R-C≡C-Me → H2, Pd → R-CH2-CH2-Me.

3. R-CH2-CH2-Me → O3, (CH3)2S → ?

But wait, O3 is for ozonolysis, which acts on double bonds. If the molecule has a single bond, ozonolysis won't do anything. So this doesn't make sense. So option C might not be the right path.

Option D: Steps are NaNH2/methanol, Li/liq NH3, O3/(CH3)2S, NH4OH.

Step 1: NaNH2 and methanol. So perhaps the alkyne is deprotonated, then reacts with methanol. Methanol is a nucleophile. So R-C≡C-H → deprotonated to R-C≡C^− Na^+.

Then, methanol (CH3OH) would react as a nucleophile, so R-C≡C^- + CH3OH → R-C≡C-OCH3 + Na+ ?

Wait, that would make an ester group? Or perhaps a ketone? I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the terminal H is replaced by OCH3, making R-C≡C-OCH3.

Then step 2: Li in liquid NH3. Li is a strong reducing agent. Could this be a Birch reduction? But Birch is for aromatic rings. Alternatively, it could be for eliminating a group.

Wait, if the compound is R-C≡C-OCH3, Li in NH3 might cause elimination, converting the triple bond into a double bond with a leaving group. But I'm not certain.

Step 3: O3 and (CH3)2S. So ozonolysis of a double bond, which would break it into carbonyl groups. Then step 4: NH4OH, which is a workup, perhaps to isolate the carbonyl compounds.

I'm not sure how this sequence would lead to the target molecule.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to first form the aldehyde and then introduce the substituent.

Wait, another angle: The substituent is a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group. That suggests that a cyclohexane ring is attached to a CH2OH group. So perhaps a cyclohexyl group is introduced through some kind of ring-opening or alkylation.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is formed via a Grignard reaction. For example, a Grignard reagent adds to an aldehyde, forming a secondary alcohol. Then, the Grignard reagent could be a cyclohexyl group.

But how would that happen?

Alternatively, perhaps the aldehyde is formed first, then a cyclopropane ring is opened to form the substituent.

Wait, maybe the ethynyl group is first converted into an aldehyde. So using ozonolysis and reductive workup.

So step 1: Ozonolysis of ethynylcyclohexane. But looking at the options, ozonolysis isn't the first step in any option. So perhaps that's not the way.

Wait, another approach: Maybe the target molecule is formed via a ring-opening of an epoxide. But I'm not sure.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the possible correct answer.

The target has an aldehyde group and a secondary alcohol group attached to the same cyclohexane. So perhaps the ethynyl group is converted into the aldehyde, and another part of the molecule is modified to form the substituent.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethynyl group is used to form a ketone, which is then reduced to a secondary alcohol. But again, I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C.

Wait, the target has a substituent with both cyclohexyl and hydroxyl groups. So perhaps a cyclohexyl group is introduced via some kind of alkylation or coupling.

But I'm not sure.

Looking back, the target molecule has a cyclohexane ring with an aldehyde and a substituent that's a CH2 group attached to both a cyclohexyl group and an OH group. So the substituent is CH2(OH)(cyclohexyl).

Hmm, perhaps this substituent is formed via a nucleophilic substitution where a leaving group is replaced by a cyclohexyl group and an OH group. But that requires a good leaving group, which we might not have.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is formed via an elimination followed by a hydration, but I'm not certain.

Another possible approach: The substituent is formed via a conjugate addition, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct steps are:

1. Convert the ethynyl group into a carbonyl group (like an aldehyde) via oxidation.

2. Perform a Grignard addition to add a cyclohexyl group and an OH group.

But I'm not sure how that would work.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Ethynylcyclohexane → hydrogenate the triple bond to a cis double bond.

2. Ozonolysis to break the double bond into two aldehyde groups.

But then how to form the substituent.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the ethynyl group is converted into an epoxide, which is then ring-opened to form the substituent. But I'm not sure how.

Alternatively, perhaps the aldehyde is formed via oxidation of the alkyne, and the substituent is formed via a coupling reaction.

Wait, perhaps the target molecule has two rings: the main cyclohexane with aldehyde and the substituent's cyclohexane. So maybe a cyclopropane ring is opened to introduce the substituent.

But I'm not getting anywhere.

I think I need to make an educated guess based on the options.

Looking at option C, the steps are:

1. NaNH2 and methylCl → alkyne becomes RC≡CMe.

2. H2/Pd → triple bond becomes single bond: RCH2CH2Me.

3. O3/(CH3)2S → but that's for double bonds; if the molecule has a single bond, ozonolysis won't do anything.

Hmm, that doesn't make sense.

Option B:

Step1: NaNH2 and ethylCl → RC≡CEt.

Step2: Li/NH3 → perhaps eliminates to form a double bond.

So RC≡CEt → RCH2CH2Et via hydrogenation? Or perhaps it forms a double bond.

Wait, if step2 is Li in NH3, which is a strong base, perhaps it deprotonates and eliminates, forming a double bond.

So RC≡CEt → RCH2CH2Et? No, perhaps elimination would form a double bond. So RC≡CEt → RCH2-CH2-Et? Or RCH2-CH2-Et would be from full hydrogenation.

Wait, perhaps step2 is a reduction of the triple bond to a double bond.

Wait, using Li in ammonia is often for reductions, like the reduction of ketones to alcohols, but in this case, perhaps it's used to reduce the triple bond to a double bond. So perhaps step2 converts the alkyne into a cis or trans double bond.

Then step3 is O3 and H2O, which would cleave the double bond into two carbonyl groups. Then step4 is NH4OH, which would perform a reductive workup, perhaps to aldehydes.

So putting it all together:

Starting with R-C≡CH → step1: R-C≡C-Et.

Step2: R-C≡C-Et → R-CH2-CH2-Et (if fully hydrogenated) or R-CH2-CH2-Et (no, that doesn't make sense for ozonolysis). Alternatively, if step2 is elimination, perhaps R-C≡C-Et becomes R-CH2-CH2-Et, which is a single bond. Ozonolysis wouldn't act on that.

Alternatively, perhaps step2 is not hydrogenation but a reduction to a double bond. So step2 would give R-CH2-CH2-Et with a double bond somewhere, perhaps between the two CH2 groups. Then ozonolysis would break that into two aldehyde groups.

Wait, for example:

R-CH2-CH2-Et → ozonolysis → R-CHO + Et-CHO.

But that wouldn't give the substituent we need.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent comes from the ethyl group. But I'm not sure.

Hmm, this is getting really tough. I'm starting to think that option C might be the correct one, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another approach: The target molecule has a cyclohexane ring with an aldehyde and a substituent that's a cyclohexylmethyl alcohol. So perhaps the substituent is formed through a Claisen or aldol condensation, but I don't see how.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is formed via a Grignard reaction. For example, the aldehyde is first formed, then a Grignard reagent adds to it, forming the secondary alcohol with a cyclohexyl group.

So the steps would be:

1. Convert ethynylcyclohexane to cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.

2. Perform Grignard reaction with cyclohexyl magnesium bromide to add a cyclohexyl group and form a secondary alcohol.

But how to make the aldehyde from ethynylcyclohexane.

Ozonolysis would do that. So ozonolysis of the alkyne would give an aldehyde.

But looking at the options, the first step isn't ozonolysis.

Wait, perhaps step1 in option B is NaNH2 and ethylCl, which would give R-C≡C-Et. Then step2 is Li/NH3, which would eliminate to form a double bond. So R-C≡C-Et → R-CH2-CH2-Et with a double bond? No, wait.

Alternatively, perhaps after elimination, the structure becomes R-CH2-CH2-Et but with a double bond elsewhere.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe it's time to look for the correct answer based on the options and the likely steps.

The target molecule has both an aldehyde and a secondary alcohol substituent. So, the aldehyde must be formed, and the substituent must be introduced.

Looking at the options, option C has O3 and (CH3)2S as step3.

Ozonolysis followed by reductive workup (like with (CH3)2S) typically converts double bonds into aldehydes or ketones. So if the molecule has a double bond, ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl groups.

So perhaps the correct steps are:

1. Convert ethynylcyclohexane into a compound with a double bond.

2. Perform ozonolysis to form an aldehyde.

3. Introduce the substituent via another reaction.

Wait, option C's steps are:

1. NaNH2 and MeCl → alkyne becomes RC≡CMe.

2. H2/Pd → triple bond becomes single bond: RCH2CH2Me.

3. O3 and (CH3)2S → but no double bond, so nothing happens?

Hmm, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps step2 isn't hydrogenation but something else. Another approach: perhaps step2 is a hydrogenation that stops at the double bond, making a cis or trans double bond.

So after step1: RC≡CMe.

Step2: H2 and Pd → RCH2CH2Me (single bond), which isn't helpful for ozonolysis.

Alternatively, perhaps the hydrogenation isn't complete, leaving a double bond. So RCH2-CH2Me → RCH2-CH2Me (as single bond) but that doesn't help.

Wait, maybe I'm wrong about the reagents. Step2 in option C is H2/Pd-calcium carbonate. Pd-CaCO3 is a catalyst for dehydrogenation or hydrogenation? It's typically used for hydrogenation, like adding H2 across triple bonds to single bonds.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is D.

Option D steps:

1. NaNH2 and methanol → perhaps deprotonate the alkyne, then react with methanol to form an ester.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation.

Alternatively, perhaps step1 forms a Grignard-like species, which then reacts with something else.

Hmm.

I think I'm stuck. After thinking through all the possibilities, I'll make an educated guess that option C is the correct sequence. So the steps are:

1. Alkyne is converted to a propargyl methyl group.

2. Hydrogenated to a single bond.

3. Ozonolysis doesn't do anything, which doesn't make sense.

Wait, maybe I'm wrong. Another thought: Maybe the correct steps involve forming a ketone first, then reducing it to an aldehyde. But I'm not seeing that in the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is B.

Option B steps:

1. NaNH2 and ethylCl → RC≡C-Et.

2. Li/NH3 → perhaps elimination to form a double bond.

3. Ozonolysis → breaks into two carbonyl groups.

4. NH4OH → perhaps to form aldehydes.

So, if the structure after step2 is R-CH2-CH2-Et, which is a single bond, ozonolysis won't do anything. But if step2 gives R-CH2-CH2-Et with a double bond, ozonolysis would break it into two aldehydes.

Wait, perhaps step2 isn't hydrogenation but reduction to a double bond.

Wait, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation. But I don't see a halide in the molecule after step1.

Hmm.

Given the time I've spent and the confusion, I think I'll have to go with option C as the most plausible, but I'm not entirely confident.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves synthesizing 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde from ethynylcyclohexane. The target molecule consists of a cyclohexane ring with an aldehyde group and a substituent that is a CH2 group attached to both a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group. The analysis of the options is as follows:

### Key Analysis of Options:

#### **Option A**:
1. **NaNH2, methyl chloride**: Likely deprotonates the alkyne and methylates it, forming a propargyl methyl group.
2. **H2/Pd**: Hydrogenates the triple bond to a single bond, resulting in a longer alkyl chain.
3. **Ba(OH)2**: A strong base, possibly for elimination or forming a carbonyl group.
4. **H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O**: Oxidation, likely to form a carboxylic acid or aldehyde.
- This sequence does not clearly lead to the target molecule, as the steps do not align with forming the cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl substituent.

#### **Option B**:
1. **NaNH2, ethyl chloride**: Deprotonates the alkyne and ethylates it, forming a propargyl ethyl group.
2. **Li/liq. NH3**: A strong base, possibly for elimination or reduction, potentially forming a double bond.
3. **O3/H2O**: Ozonolysis, which acts on double bonds to form carbonyl groups.
4. **NH4OH**: Reductive workup, likely to reduce ozonides to aldehydes or ketones.
- While this sequence could form aldehyde groups, it does not clearly explain how the cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl substituent is introduced.

#### **Option C**:
1. **NaNH2, methyl chloride**: Deprotonates the alkyne and methylates it, forming a propargyl methyl group.
2. **H2/Pd-calcium carbonate**: Hydrogenates the triple bond to a single bond, resulting in a longer alkyl chain.
3. **O3/(CH3)2S**: Ozonolysis with a reductive workup, typically used to break double bonds into carbonyl groups.
4. **Ba(OH)2**: A strong base, possibly for elimination or forming a carbonyl group.
- This sequence is problematic because ozonolysis requires a double bond, which is not present after hydrogenation in step 2. Thus, this option does not clearly lead to the target molecule.

#### **Option D**:
1. **NaNH2, methanol**: Deprotonates the alkyne and reacts with methanol, potentially forming an ester or a substituted alkyne.
2. **Li/liq. NH3**: A strong base, possibly for elimination or reduction.
3. **O3/(CH3)2S**: Ozonolysis with a reductive workup, typically used to break double bonds into carbonyl groups.
4. **NH4OH**: Reductive workup, likely to reduce ozonides to aldehydes or ketones.
- This sequence is unclear in how it would introduce the cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl substituent or form the aldehyde group.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing all options, none of the sequences clearly and directly lead to the target molecule. However, **Option C** is the most plausible among the given choices, as it involves steps that could potentially form the aldehyde group and introduce the substituent, even though the exact mechanism is unclear.

**Answer: C**
