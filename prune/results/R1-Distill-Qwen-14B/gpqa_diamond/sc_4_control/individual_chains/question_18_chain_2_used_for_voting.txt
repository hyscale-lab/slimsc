Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their elemental abundances. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to work through it step by step.

So, the question is about finding the ratio of silicon atoms in two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. The given data includes their masses, some abundance ratios, and some solar photospheric compositions.

First, let me list all the given information:

Star_1:
- Mass = 1.5 times the Sun's mass.
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex.
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex.

Star_2:
- Mass = 1.2 times the Sun's mass.
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex.
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex.

Solar photosphere:
- 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 → So, log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 - 12 = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5) ≈ 3.16e-5.
- 12 + log10(nMg/nH) = 7 → So, log10(nMg/nH) = 7 -12 = -5 → nMg/nH = 10^(-5) = 1e-5.

Wait, but wait a second. The question is about the ratio of silicon atoms in the two stars. So I think I need to find [Si/H] for each star and then compute the ratio [Si_1 / H_1] divided by [Si_2 / H_2], or something like that. Or maybe it's the ratio of silicon in each star relative to the sun, and then take the ratio of those two.

Let me think about the notation. The [X/Y] notation is logarithmic, defined as log10(nX/nY) - log10(nX/nY)_sun. So [X/Y] = log10(nX/nY in star) - log10(nX/nY in sun). Therefore, nX/nY (star) = 10^{ [X/Y] } * nX/nY (sun).

So for each star, I can find the abundance of silicon relative to hydrogen, then find the ratio between Star_1 and Star_2.

Let me start with Star_1.

Star_1: [Fe/H] = 0 → Fe/H for Star_1 is same as sun. So [Fe/H]_1 = 0 → log10(nFe/nH) = same as sun. So nFe/nH = 3.16e-5.

[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → log10(nSi/nFe) = 0.3 → nSi/nFe = 10^0.3 ≈ 2.

So nSi = nFe * 2.

But nFe is 3.16e-5 * nH (since nFe/nH is 3.16e-5). So nSi = 2 * 3.16e-5 * nH = 6.32e-5 * nH.

Wait, but in the Sun, nFe/nH is 3.16e-5, but in Star_1, what about H? Well, [Fe/H] is 0, so [Fe/H]_1 = 0 → nFe/nH in Star_1 is same as in Sun. So nFe in Star_1 is 3.16e-5 * nH_1. But wait, but wait. The H in Star_1 could be different? Wait, but [Fe/H] is 0, which is log(nFe/nH) - log(sun's nFe/nH) = 0 → so nFe/nH in Star_1 is same as in Sun. So nFe in Star_1 is same as in Sun relative to H.

So for Star_1, nSi = 2 * nFe. Since nFe = 3.16e-5 * nH (Sun), but wait, in Star_1, nFe/nH is same as Sun, so nFe = 3.16e-5 * nH_Star1. So nSi = 2 * 3.16e-5 * nH_Star1 = 6.32e-5 * nH_Star1.

Wait, but what about nH in each star? Because the stars have different masses, but the problem says to assume LTE and use the EW method. Wait, but I think in this case, the mass of the star doesn't directly affect the abundance ratios because we're considering the photospheric composition, which for stars in LTE, the abundance ratios are determined by their compositions, not their masses. So I think the mass is a red herring here, or perhaps it's not needed for calculating the abundance ratios. Or perhaps it's for another part of the problem, but maybe not this one.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just about the ratios of the elements, so the mass doesn't come into play here. Let's proceed.

So for Star_1, [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → [Si/Fe] = log10(nSi/nFe) - log10(sun's nSi/nFe) = 0.3 → so nSi/nFe in Star_1 is 10^(0.3) times that of the Sun.

Wait, no, wait. The [X/Y] notation is log10(nX/nY in star) - log10(nX/nY in sun). So for Star_1, [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → log10(nSi/nFe)_1 - log10(nSi/nFe)_sun = 0.3 → log10(nSi/nFe)_1 = log10(nSi/nFe)_sun + 0.3 → nSi/nFe in Star_1 is 10^(0.3) times that of the Sun.

Since we know the Sun's nFe/nH, but what about nSi/nH in the Sun? Because I don't have that. Hmm, that's a problem.

Wait, perhaps I can get the Sun's nSi/nH from the data. No, the problem doesn't provide that. Wait, the Sun's [Si/Fe] is not given, but we can compute it from the given data.

Wait, the Sun's [Fe/H] is given, but that's [Fe/H] for the stars, not the Sun. Wait, no, the Sun's photospheric composition is given. Let me re-express that.

The Sun's photosphere has 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5 → log10(nFe/nH)= -4.5 → nFe/nH=3.16e-5.

Similarly, for Mg, 12 + log10(nMg/nH)=7 → log10(nMg/nH)= -5 → nMg/nH=1e-5.

But what about nSi/nH in the Sun? Hmm, the problem doesn't provide it. So maybe I can't get it from the given data. Hmm, this might be a problem.

Wait, but for Star_1, I have [Si/Fe] =0.3, and [Fe/H] =0. So I can find nSi/nH for Star_1.

Let me consider Star_1:

nFe/nH = same as Sun, because [Fe/H] is 0. So nFe = Sun's nFe * (nH_Star1 / Sun's nH). Wait, but in [Fe/H], since [Fe/H] is 0, nFe/nH in Star_1 is same as in Sun.

Wait, but wait, the [Fe/H] is log10(nFe/nH) - log10(sun's nFe/nH) =0 → so nFe/nH in Star_1 is same as in Sun → so nFe = same multiple of H as in Sun.

So nFe_1 = (3.16e-5) * nH_1.

And nSi_1 = (nSi/nFe)_1 * nFe_1 = 10^0.3 * (nSi/nFe)_sun * nFe_1.

Wait, but (nSi/nFe)_sun is log10(nSi/nFe)_sun = [Si/Fe]_sun.

Wait, but I don't know [Si/Fe]_sun. Hmm. That's a problem.

Wait, but perhaps I can find nSi/nH in the Sun by using the given [Mg/Si]_2 for Star_2.

Wait, in Star_2, [Mg/Si]_2 =0.3 → log10(nMg/nSi)_2 - log10(nMg/nSi)_sun =0.3 → nMg/nSi in Star_2 = 10^0.3 * (nMg/nSi)_sun.

And [Mg/H]_2 =0 → so nMg/nH in Star_2 is same as in Sun → nMg_2 = (1e-5) * nH_2.

So nMg_2 =1e-5 * nH_2.

So nSi_2 = nMg_2 / (10^0.3 * (nMg/nSi)_sun).

Wait, but I don't know (nMg/nSi)_sun. Hmm.

Wait, but I do know nMg/nH in the Sun is 1e-5.

But without knowing nSi/nH in the Sun, I can't proceed. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps for the Sun, the [Mg/Si] ratio is some standard value. But I don't have that. Alternatively, maybe the problem is designed so that the Sun's [Mg/Si] doesn't matter, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again.

We need to find the ratio of silicon atoms in the two stars, (nSi_1 / nH_1) divided by (nSi_2 / nH_2). Because that ratio would be (nSi_1 / nH_1) / (nSi_2 / nH_2) = (nSi_1 / nH_1) * (nH_2 / nSi_2).

Wait, but perhaps it's better to compute [Si/H]_1 and [Si/H]_2, then take 10^{([Si/H]_1 - [Si/H]_2)} to get the ratio.

So first, let's find [Si/H]_1 and [Si/H]_2.

For Star_1:

[Fe/H]_1=0 → [Fe/H]_1 = log10(nFe/nH)_1 - log10(nFe/nH)_sun =0 → nFe/nH in Star_1 is same as in Sun.

So nFe_1 = (3.16e-5) * nH_1.

[Si/Fe]_1=0.3 → log10(nSi/nFe)_1 = 0.3 + log10(nSi/nFe)_sun.

But I don't know log10(nSi/nFe)_sun. Oh wait, but in the Sun, nFe and nSi are both known relative to H, so their ratio can be found.

Wait, in the Sun, nFe/nH =3.16e-5. If I can get nSi/nH, then nSi/nFe is (nSi/nH)/(nFe/nH) = (nSi/nH)/(3.16e-5). But the problem doesn't provide nSi/nH for the Sun. Hmm, this is a problem.

Wait, maybe I can find [Si/Fe]_sun? I think in the Sun, the abundance of Si is about 7.51e-5 relative to H, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to assume that [Si/Fe]_sun is 0.0, but that's probably not correct.

Wait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think again.

Let me focus on each star and compute their [Si/H] ratios.

For Star_1:

[Fe/H]_1=0 → [Fe/H]_1 = log10(nFe/nH)_1 - log10(nFe/nH)_sun =0 → nFe/nH)_1 = nFe/nH)_sun.

So nFe_1 = (3.16e-5) * nH_1.

[Si/Fe]_1 =0.3 → [Si/Fe]_1 = log10(nSi_1/nFe_1) - log10(nSi_sun/nFe_sun) =0.3.

So nSi_1/nFe_1 = 10^(0.3) * (nSi_sun/nFe_sun).

But nFe_1 =3.16e-5 * nH_1.

So nSi_1 = (10^0.3 * (nSi_sun/nFe_sun)) * nFe_1 = 10^0.3 * (nSi_sun/nFe_sun) * 3.16e-5 * nH_1.

I can express this as nSi_1 = (10^0.3 * (nSi_sun/nFe_sun) * 3.16e-5) * nH_1.

But I don't know nSi_sun/nFe_sun.

Hmm, perhaps another approach is needed.

Alternatively, maybe I can find the ratio of Si to H in each star and then find the ratio between the two.

Let me think about Star_1 first.

For Star_1:

We have [Fe/H]_1=0 → nFe_1/nH_1 = nFe_sun/nH_sun =3.16e-5.

[Si/Fe]_1 =0.3 → nSi_1/nFe_1 = 10^0.3 * (nSi_sun/nFe_sun).

So nSi_1/nH_1 = (nSi_1/nFe_1) * (nFe_1/nH_1) ) = 10^0.3 * (nSi_sun/nFe_sun) * 3.16e-5.

So [Si/H]_1 = log10(nSi_1/nH_1) - log10(nSi_sun/nH_sun) = log10( [10^0.3 * (nSi_sun/nFe_sun) * 3.16e-5 ] / (nSi_sun/nH_sun) ) )

Wait, that's a bit messy, but let's break it down.

Wait, [Si/H]_1 = log10(nSi_1/nH_1) - log10(nSi_sun/nH_sun) ) → which is log10( (nSi_1/nH_1) / (nSi_sun/nH_sun) )).

Which is log10( (nSi_1/nFe_1) * (nFe_1/nH_1) ) / (nSi_sun/nH_sun) ) ) → since nFe_1/nH_1 is same as Sun.

Wait, no. Wait, nFe_1/nH_1 =3.16e-5.

nSi_1/nH_1 = (nSi_1/nFe_1) * (nFe_1/nH_1) ) → which is 10^0.3 * (nSi_sun/nFe_sun) ) * 3.16e-5.

So [Si/H]_1 = log10( (10^0.3 * (nSi_sun/nFe_sun) *3.16e-5 ) * (nFe_1/nH_1) ) / (nSi_sun/nH_sun) ) )

Wait, but I'm getting stuck because I don't know nSi_sun/nFe_sun.

Similarly, for Star_2:

[Mg/H]_2=0 → nMg_2/nH_2 = nMg_sun/nH_sun =1e-5.

[Mg/Si]_2=0.3 → nMg_2/nSi_2 = 10^0.3 * (nMg_sun/nSi_sun).

So nSi_2 = nMg_2/(10^0.3 * (nMg_sun/nSi_sun)).

nMg_2 =1e-5 * nH_2.

So nSi_2 = (1e-5 nH_2) / (10^0.3 * (nMg_sun/nSi_sun)).

Again, I don't know nMg_sun/nSi_sun.

This is getting complicated. Maybe I'm missing something obvious.

Wait, perhaps the problem is designed so that the solar values of [Si/Fe] and [Mg/Si] can be inferred from the given data.

Wait, the Sun's [Fe/H] is not given. Wait, no, the Sun's photosphere is given with nFe/nH and nMg/nH, but not nSi/nH.

Hmm, this is a problem. I think I need to make an assumption here, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the Sun's [Mg/Si] ratio is given indirectly. Because for Star_2, [Mg/Si]_2 =0.3, and [Mg/H]_2=0.

Wait, for Star_2, [Mg/H]_2=0 → nMg_2/nH_2 = nMg_sun/nH_sun =1e-5.

So nMg_2 = 1e-5 * nH_2.

[Mg/Si]_2=0.3 → nMg_2/nSi_2 = 10^0.3 * (nMg_sun/nSi_sun).

So, nSi_2 = nMg_2/(10^0.3 * (nMg_sun/nSi_sun)).

But I don't know nMg_sun/nSi_sun, which is the Sun's [Mg/Si] ratio.

Wait, but perhaps I can find it from the Sun's data. Because I know nMg_sun/nH_sun =1e-5, and if I could find nSi_sun/nH_sun, then I could compute nMg_sun/nSi_sun = (1e-5 * nH_sun) / (nSi_sun/nH_sun * nH_sun) ) → which is (1e-5) / (nSi_sun/nH_sun).

Wait, but without knowing nSi_sun/nH_sun, this is a dead end.

Hmm. Maybe I'm approaching this incorrectly. Let me try a different angle.

The question is the ratio of silicon atoms in the two stars: nSi_1 / nH_1 divided by nSi_2 / nH_2.

So (nSi_1 / nH_1) / (nSi_2 / nH_2) = (nSi_1 * nH_2) / (nSi_2 * nH_1).

But I don't know nH_1 or nH_2, but perhaps the ratio nH_2/nH_1 can be determined somehow... Wait, but the problem doesn't provide any data about the star's overall composition or temperature, so perhaps the H abundance is the same in both stars, but that's an assumption I can't make unless it's stated.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem doesn't require knowing the absolute number of H, just the ratio of Si to H in each star, and then the ratio of those.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed so that the [Si/Fe] and [Mg/Si] can be used to find [Si/H] for each star, and then their ratio can be found without needing the Sun's [Si/H].

Let me think again about Star_1.

For Star_1:

[Fe/H] = 0 → nFe_1 = nFe_sun * (nH_1 / nH_sun).

Wait, but nFe_1 = (nFe_sun / nH_sun) * nH_1.

So [Si/Fe]_1 =0.3 → log10(nSi_1/nFe_1) =0.3 + log10(nSi_sun/nFe_sun).

So nSi_1 = nFe_1 * 10^{0.3} * (nSi_sun/nFe_sun).

Substituting nFe_1:

nSi_1 = (nFe_sun/nH_sun * nH_1) * 10^{0.3} * (nSi_sun/nFe_sun).

Simplify:

nSi_1 = nH_1 * (nFe_sun/nH_sun) * 10^{0.3} * (nSi_sun/nFe_sun).

This becomes nH_1 * (nFe_sun * 10^{0.3} * nSi_sun) / (nH_sun * nFe_sun).

The nFe_sun cancels out: nH_1 * 10^{0.3} * nSi_sun / (nH_sun).

So nSi_1 = (10^{0.3} * nSi_sun / nH_sun) * nH_1.

Now, [Si/H]_1 = log10(nSi_1/nH_1) - log10(nSi_sun/nH_sun).

Which is log10( (10^{0.3} * nSi_sun/nH_sun) * nH_1 / nH_1 ) - log10(nSi_sun/nH_sun) → log10(10^{0.3} * nSi_sun/nH_sun) - log10(nSi_sun/nH_sun) = 0.3.

So [Si/H]_1 =0.3 → which means nSi_1/nH_1 = 10^{0.3} * (nSi_sun/nH_sun).

Wait, that can't be right, because [Si/H]_1 is 0.3, meaning that Si is 0.3 dex higher than in the Sun relative to H.

Wait, but wait. Because [Fe/H]_1 is 0, and [Si/Fe]_1 is 0.3, then [Si/H]_1 should be [Fe/H]_1 + [Si/Fe]_1 = 0 +0.3=0.3. Oh! That's much simpler.

Ah! That's probably the key. Because [X/H] = [X/Y] + [Y/H].

So for any element X, [X/H] = [X/Y] + [Y/H].

So for Star_1:

[Si/H]_1 = [Si/Fe]_1 + [Fe/H]_1 =0.3 +0 =0.3.

Similarly, for Star_2, any X:

[Mg/H]_2 = [Mg/Si]_2 + [Si/H]_2.

Wait, but we know [Mg/H]_2 is 0, and [Mg/Si]_2 is 0.3. So:

0 = 0.3 + [Si/H]_2 → [Si/H]_2 = -0.3.

So now, I can find [Si/H]_1 and [Si/H]_2.

[Si/H]_1 =0.3 → so nSi_1/nH_1 = 10^{0.3} * (nSi_sun/nH_sun).

[Si/H]_2 =-0.3 → so nSi_2/nH_2 = 10^{-0.3} * (nSi_sun/nH_sun).

So the ratio (nSi_1/nH_1) / (nSi_2/nH_2) = [10^{0.3} * (nSi_sun/nH_sun)] / [10^{-0.3} * (nSi_sun/nH_sun)] ) = 10^{0.3 +0.3} =10^{0.6}.

10^0.6 is approximately 3.98, which is about 4. So the ratio is approximately 4.

Looking at the options, option A is ~3.9.

Therefore, the correct answer should be option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2, we analyze the given elemental abundance data and use the logarithmic abundance notation. The key steps are as follows:

### Key Information:
1. **Star_1**:
   - Mass: 1.5 times the Sun.
   - [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex.
   - [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex.

2. **Star_2**:
   - Mass: 1.2 times the Sun.
   - [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex.
   - [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex.

3. **Solar Photosphere**:
   - 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 → log10(nFe/nH) = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 3.16 × 10⁻⁵.
   - 12 + log10(nMg/nH) = 7 → log10(nMg/nH) = -5 → nMg/nH = 1 × 10⁻⁵.

### Analysis:
#### For Star_1:
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 implies that the ratio of Fe to H in Star_1 is the same as in the Sun: nFe/nH = 3.16 × 10⁻⁵.
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 implies that the ratio of Si to Fe in Star_1 is 10⁰.³ ≈ 2 times the ratio in the Sun.
- Using the relationship [Si/H] = [Si/Fe] + [Fe/H], we find:
  \[
  [\text{Si/H}]_1 = 0.3 + 0 = 0.3
  \]
  Thus, the ratio of Si to H in Star_1 is:
  \[
  n_{\text{Si}}/n_{\text{H}} = 10^{0.3} \cdot (n_{\text{Si}}/n_{\text{H}})_{\odot}
  \]

#### For Star_2:
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 implies that the ratio of Mg to H in Star_2 is the same as in the Sun: nMg/nH = 1 × 10⁻⁵.
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 implies that the ratio of Mg to Si in Star_2 is 10⁰.³ ≈ 2 times the ratio in the Sun.
- Using the relationship [Mg/H] = [Mg/Si] + [Si/H], we find:
  \[
  [\text{Mg/H}]_2 = 0.3 + [\text{Si/H}]_2 \implies [\text{Si/H}]_2 = -0.3
  \]
  Thus, the ratio of Si to H in Star_2 is:
  \[
  n_{\text{Si}}/n_{\text{H}} = 10^{-0.3} \cdot (n_{\text{Si}}/n_{\text{H}})_{\odot}
  \]

#### Ratio of Silicon Atoms:
The ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 to Star_2 is:
\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si}}/n_{\text{H}} \, (\text{Star}_1)}{n_{\text{Si}}/n_{\text{H}} \, (\text{Star}_2)} = \frac{10^{0.3} \cdot (n_{\text{Si}}/n_{\text{H}})_{\odot}}{10^{-0.3} \cdot (n_{\text{Si}}/n_{\text{H}})_{\odot}} = 10^{0.3 + 0.3} = 10^{0.6}
\]
- 10⁰.⁶ ≈ 3.98, which is approximately 4.

### Conclusion:
The ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2 is approximately **3.9**.
