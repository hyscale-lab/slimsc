Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me try to figure it out. So, the question is about finding the value of 'a' in the wave function of a particle. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. The setup is that each particle is in a system, and when they're measured, they're only found between x=1 and x=3. So, we're told that the wave function exists in that region.

Wait, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the wave function must be normalizable. That means the integral of the absolute square of the wave function over all space must equal 1. Also, the wave function should be zero outside the region where the particle can be found. But in this case, the wave function is given as (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i, but when we measure positions, particles are only found between 1 and 3. So, perhaps the wave function is zero outside this interval.

Wait, but looking at the wave function, it's (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. That seems a bit odd. Typically, the wave function is a complex function, but usually, the spatial part is a real function multiplied by a time-dependent exponential. Oh, wait, maybe this is a stationary state, so the time part is factored out, and we're just looking at the spatial part. Hmm.

But regardless, the wave function given is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Wait, but if we square the modulus of the wave function, that should be the probability density. So, |ψ|^2 = (a/sqrt(1+x))^2 + (0.5)^2 because the imaginary part is 0.5i. So, the probability density is (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25.

But wait, the wave function can't be non-zero outside the region where the particle is found. So according to the question, when measuring, particles are found between x=1 and x=3. So that suggests that the wave function must be zero outside of this region. Hmm. But looking at the given wave function, it's (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So that's not zero outside x<1 and x>3. Hmm, maybe that's just the form in the region where the particle exists, and it's zero elsewhere. Because the question states that the wave function is described as such in the part of space where the particle can exist, which is between x=1 and x=3.

So, the wave function is non-zero only between x=1 and x=3. Therefore, the integral of |ψ(x)|² from x=1 to x=3 must equal 1. So, I need to compute this integral and solve for 'a'.

So, let's write the wave function as ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. The modulus squared is [ (a / sqrt(1+x) )² + (0.5)^2 ].

So, |ψ(x)|² = [a²/(1+x)] + 0.25.

Wait, no. Wait, the modulus squared of a complex number (a + bi) is a² + b². But in this case, it's (a/sqrt(1+x)) minus 0.5i. So the real part is a/sqrt(1+x), and the imaginary part is -0.5. So the modulus squared is (a²)/(1+x) + (0.5)^2, which is (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25.

Therefore, the integral from x=1 to x=3 of [ (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx must equal 1.

So, let's denote the integral as:

Integral from 1 to 3 of (a²)/(1+x) dx + Integral from 1 to 3 of 0.25 dx = 1.

Let me compute each part separately.

First integral: ∫ (a²)/(1+x) dx from 1 to 3.

Let me make substitution u = 1+x. Then du = dx.

When x=1, u=2; x=3, u=4.

So this becomes a² ∫ (1/u) du from u=2 to u=4.

The integral of 1/u du is ln(u). So,

a² [ ln(4) - ln(2) ] = a² ln(4/2) = a² ln(2).

Second integral: ∫ 0.25 dx from 1 to 3.

That's 0.25*(3-1) = 0.25*2 = 0.5.

So adding both results:

a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So, a² ln(2) = 0.5.

Then, a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

Compute ln(2): approximately 0.6931.

So, a² ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7202.

Taking the square root, a ≈ sqrt(0.7202) ≈ 0.8485.

Hmm, looking at the options, option B is 0.85. That would be the closest.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations. Did I make any mistake?

Wait, in the integral ∫(a²/(1+x))dx from 1 to 3, that's correct because the substitution u=1+x. The first integral is a² ln(2). Second integral is 0.25*(3-1)=0.5. Then total is a² ln(2) + 0.5 =1, so a² ln(2)=0.5 → a²=0.5/ln2 ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931≈ 0.7202 → a ≈ 0.8485, which is about 0.85.

So the answer is option B.

To determine the value of \( a \) in the wave function \(\psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i\), we use the normalization condition for wave functions in quantum mechanics. The integral of the probability density \(|\psi(x)|^2\) over the region where the particle exists (between \(x=1\) and \(x=3\)) must equal 1. 

The probability density is given by:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (-0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25.
\]

The normalization condition is:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1.
\]

This integral can be split into two parts:

1. \(\int_{1}^{3} \frac{a^2}{1+x} dx\):  
   Using the substitution \(u = 1+x\), \(du = dx\), the limits change from \(x=1\) (\(u=2\)) to \(x=3\) (\(u=4\)).  
   The integral becomes:  
   \[
   a^2 \int_{2}^{4} \frac{1}{u} du = a^2 \left[\ln(u)\right]_{2}^{4} = a^2 \ln(4/2) = a^2 \ln(2).
   \]

2. \(\int_{1}^{3} 0.25 dx\):  
   \[
   0.25 \int_{1}^{3} dx = 0.25 (3-1) = 0.25 \cdot 2 = 0.5.
   \]

Adding these results, the normalization condition becomes:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.
\]

Solving for \(a^2\):  
\[
a^2 \ln(2) = 0.5 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}.
\]

Using \(\ln(2) \approx 0.6931\):  
\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7202 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a \approx \sqrt{0.7202} \approx 0.8485.
\]

The closest value to \(0.8485\) among the options is \(0.85\), which corresponds to option **B**.
