Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when some acids and a base are mixed. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me think through this.

Alright, the problem says we mix 500 mL of 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL of 0.3 M H2SO4, and 200 mL of 0.5 M Ba(OH)2. I need to find the enthalpy change for this reaction. The options are given in kcal and kJ, so I should probably pay attention to the units.

First, I remember that the enthalpy of neutralization is usually considered per mole of H+ reacting with OH- to form water. But wait, these are strong acid and strong base reactions, so they should be exothermic, right? So the enthalpy change will be negative.

I think the first step is to calculate the moles of H+ from each acid and the moles of OH- from the base. Then, compare them to see which is the limiting reactant.

Let's break it down:

HCl is a strong acid. Each HCl molecule gives one H+ ion. So moles of HCl is Molarity * Volume (in liters). HCl has 0.2 M and 0.5 L. So 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 moles of HCl → 0.1 moles H+.

H2SO4 is a strong acid too, and it's diprotic. So each molecule gives two H+ ions. The volume is 0.3 L, molarity 0.3 M. So moles of H2SO4 is 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles. Since each gives two H+, total H+ is 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. Each molecule gives two OH- ions because Ba(OH)2 → Ba^2+ + 2OH-. The volume is 0.2 L, molarity 0.5 M. So moles of Ba(OH)2 is 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 moles. Each mole gives 2 OH-, so total OH- is 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 moles.

Wait, but wait a second. The OH- from Ba(OH)2 is 0.2 moles, and the H+ from HCl and H2SO4 is 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 moles. So the H+ is more than OH-, so OH- is the limiting reagent here. So all the OH- will react, and some H+ will be left.

But wait, the neutralization reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O. Each mole of H+ reacts with a mole of OH-. So moles of H+ available: 0.28, OH- available: 0.2. So they'll neutralize 0.2 moles of H+ and 0.2 moles of OH-.

But wait, the problem is about the enthalpy of neutralization. The standard enthalpy of neutralization is usually given as about -57.3 kJ per mole of H+ (or OH-) reacting. So for each mole of H+ that reacts, it's about -57.3 kJ.

But wait, another thing: H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, so when it reacts with a base, the first H+ is more acidic and neutralizes first, and the second H+ is less so. But in the case of strong base, I think both H+ ions from H2SO4 would react. Or does it depend on the stoichiometry?

Wait no, let me clarify. When H2SO4 is a strong acid, it dissociates completely in water. So in solution, it gives 2 H+ and SO4^2- ions. So the total H+ is indeed 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

So putting it all together: total H+ is 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28, and OH- is 0.2. So the reaction will involve 0.2 moles of H+ and OH-.

So the enthalpy change is moles reacted * enthalpy per mole. So 0.2 moles * (-57.3 kJ/mol) = -11.46 kJ. Hmm, but wait, the options are in kcal and kJ.

Wait, another point: the standard enthalpy of neutralization is usually given as -57.3 kJ per mole of H+. Alternatively, it's sometimes expressed as -1.0 kcal per mole, but more accurately it's about -57.3 kJ/mol H+.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think. 1 cal is about 4.184 J. 1 kcal is 4184 J, which is about 4.184 kJ. So 57.3 kJ is around 13.66 kcal (since 57.3 /4.184 ≈ 13.66). So each mole of H+ gives about -13.66 kcal, but wait I think the standard value is -57.3 kJ per mole (or per mole of H+). Alternatively, it's about -57.3 kJ per mole of acid-base reaction (like H+ + OH- → H2O).

Wait, I'm getting a bit mixed up. Let me look it up in my notes. Oh wait, I can't, but I remember that the standard enthalpy of neutralization for strong acids and strong bases is about -57.3 kJ per mole of H+ reacting.

So in this case, 0.2 moles of H+ and OH- reacting. So the enthalpy change is 0.2 * (-57.3) = -11.46 kJ.

Looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ, which is more. Option B is -11.42 kcal. Wait, but wait, the units. Let me double-check.

Wait, I calculated -11.46 kJ, but the options have B as -11.42 kcal and D as -16.0 kJ.

Wait, I think I might have made a mistake. Because sometimes the enthalpy of neutralization is given per mole of acid, not per mole of H+. Hmm.

Wait, HCl is a monoprotic acid (1 H+ per mole), H2SO4 is diprotic (2 H+ per mole). So when H2SO4 is neutralized, each mole contributes two H+.

But when considering the neutralization reaction, each mole of H2SO4 can donate two H+ ions, each requiring one OH-.

Wait, but in the problem, the enthalpy of neutralization refers to the total H+ neutralized. So the total H+ is 0.28 moles, but only 0.2 moles react. So the total enthalpy change is 0.2 * (-57.3) = -11.46 kJ.

But looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ, which is much lower. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the total H+ and OH- and see the net, but I think I did that correctly.

Wait, another thought: could the problem be considering all the H+ from H2SO4 as reacting? No, because OH- is the limiting reagent.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the enthalpy of neutralization is given per mole of reaction, considering the stoichiometry. Let me think about the balanced equation.

The overall reaction would involve H+ from HCl and H2SO4 reacting with OH- from Ba(OH)2.

So HCl: H+ + Cl-.
H2SO4: 2 H+ + SO4^2-.
Ba(OH)2: Ba^2+ + 2 OH-.

When they mix, the H+ (from HCl and H2SO4) will react with OH- (from Ba(OH)2) to form water.

The total H+ is 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 moles. OH- is 0.2 moles.

So the neutralization reaction will proceed until all OH- is consumed. So 0.2 moles of H+ will react with 0.2 moles of OH- to form 0.2 moles of H2O.

The enthalpy change for each mole of H+ is -57.3 kJ. So 0.2 * (-57.3) = -11.46 kJ.

Looking at the options, option B is -11.42 kcal. Wait, but my calculation is in kJ, and the options have B as kcal and D as kJ.

Wait, did I mess up units? Let me see. 57.3 kJ per mole H+. So 0.2 moles * 57.3 kJ = 11.46 kJ. So negative, -11.46 kJ.

But the options are D) -16.0 kJ, which is more negative.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe I should consider the total possible neutralization if all H+ and OH- were to react, but that's not the case because OH- is limiting.

Wait, another approach: maybe calculate moles of H+ and OH- and see which is in excess.

H+ total: 0.28 moles.

OH- total: 0.2 moles.

So OH- is the limiting reactant.

So moles of H+ consumed: 0.2. Enthalpy change: 0.2 * (-57.3) kJ = -11.46 kJ.

But the options don't have that exact value. Option B is -11.42 kcal. Hmm, perhaps the calculation needs to be done in kcal instead of kJ.

Wait, 57.3 kJ per mole is the same as 57.3 / 4.184 ≈ 13.66 kcal per mole. So per mole of H+.

So 0.2 * (-13.66) = -2.732 kcal.

Which is approximately -2.73 kcal, which is close to option A: -2.72 kcal. But wait, that's a big difference.

Wait wait, perhaps I'm confusing the standard enthalpy. Let me think again. The standard enthalpy of neutralization is approximately -57.3 kJ per mole of H+ (or per mole of OH-). So if the reaction is 1:1 between H+ and OH-, each mole contributes -57.3 kJ.

So in our case, 0.2 moles of H+ reacting: 0.2 * (-57.3) = -11.46 kJ.

So which option is that? Looking at the options, D is -16.0 kJ, which is higher than that. Could I have messed up the calculation of moles?

Let me recalculate moles:

HCl: 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 moles H+.

H2SO4: 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 moles H2SO4 → 0.18 moles H+.

Ba(OH)2: 0.5 M * 0.2 L = 0.1 moles → 0.2 moles OH-.

So that's correct. So OH- is 0.2, H+ is 0.28. So net H+ is 0.08 left, but the OH- is all used up.

So the enthalpy is 0.2 * (-57.3) = -11.46 kJ, which is approximately -11.5 kJ. But the options don't have that. Hmm.

Wait, the options have option B as -11.42 kcal. Let's see: 11.46 kJ is equal to about 2.737 kcal (since 11.46 / 4.184 ≈ 2.737). Wait that's not matching. Oh wait, no, I think I messed the units.

Wait, 57.3 kJ is approximately 13.66 kcal. So if I have 0.2 moles, it's 0.2 * 13.66 = 2.732 kcal. So the enthalpy change is -2.732 kcal, which is approximately -2.73 kcal.

Looking at the options, option A is -2.72 kcal. So perhaps that's the intended answer.

Wait, but why is there a discrepancy between the two units? Because 0.2 moles times 57.3 kJ is 11.46 kJ, which is about 2.73 kcal. So why is the option B at -11.42 kcal?

Hmm, perhaps a miscalculation in the problem statement.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the total possible neutralization without considering the limiting reagent, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the total H+ and OH- and see which is in excess, but I think I did that correctly.

Wait another angle: maybe the reaction is considering the stoichiometry between the acid and base, not just the H+ and OH-.

Wait, for instance, when H2SO4 is mixed with Ba(OH)2, perhaps the reaction is:

H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 + 2 H2O.

But wait, the stoichiometry would be 1 mole H2SO4 reacting with 1 mole Ba(OH)2 to produce 1 mole BaSO4 and 2 moles H2O.

So in that case, the moles of H2SO4 is 0.09 and Ba(OH)2 is 0.1. So H2SO4 is the limiting reagent here, and Ba(OH)2 would have some left.

But wait, that's a separate reaction from HCl and Ba(OH)2. So perhaps the total neutralization involves both H2SO4 and HCl reacting with Ba(OH)2.

So maybe I need to consider each acid reaction with the base separately.

Let me think: HCl (H+) and H2SO4 (2 H+) reacting with OH- (from Ba(OH)2).

Alternatively, perhaps the overall reaction can be considered as the sum of the individual neutralizations.

Let me attempt to write the reactions.

HCl + Ba(OH)2 → BaCl2 + H2O.

But wait, the balanced equation would be:

HCl + Ba(OH)2 → BaCl2 + 2 H2O.

But that's not correct because Ba(OH)2 has two OH- groups. So for each HCl, one H+ is neutralized by one OH-.

Similarly, H2SO4 would donate two H+ ions, each of which would react with OH-.

Alternatively, perhaps the overall reaction is between all the H+ ions and the OH-.

Wait, I think the initial approach is correct, treating all H+ as available to react with OH-.

So the total H+ is 0.28, OH- is 0.2. So 0.2 moles of H+ and OH- neutralize, giving 0.2 moles H2O.

Thus, enthalpy change is 0.2 * (-57.3) = -11.46 kJ ≈ -11.46 kJ.

But the options don't have this. The closest option is D) -16.0 kJ, which is more.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in the calculation of moles. Let me recompute the moles.

HCl: 500 mL = 0.5 L. 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 moles HCl → 0.1 H+.

H2SO4: 300 mL = 0.3 L. 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 moles H2SO4 → 0.18 H+.

Ba(OH)2: 200 mL = 0.2 L. 0.5 M * 0.2 L = 0.1 moles Ba(OH)2 → 0.2 OH-.

So, yes, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the enthalpy of neutralization is not per mole of H+ but per mole of reaction. For example, for HCl and H2SO4, each mole contributes differently.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the use of the formula for enthalpy change as:

q = n * ΔH°

where ΔH° is the enthalpy per mole.

So perhaps I should calculate the total moles of H+ available and see how much reacts, then multiply by ΔH.

Wait, I think I did that correctly.

Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the problem is using a different value for the enthalpy of neutralization. Like, perhaps it's 57.3 kJ per mole of acid, not per mole of H+.

Wait, for HCl, each mole gives one H+. So enthalpy is -57.3 kJ per mole of HCl.

For H2SO4, each mole gives two H+, so per mole, it's 2 * (-57.3) = -114.6 kJ.

But that's per mole of H2SO4. Alternatively, if the problem is considering each mole of acid contributing, perhaps we should calculate the total H+.

Wait, but I think the standard approach is to consider per mole of H+.

Wait another approach: perhaps the problem expects the calculation of the total H+ neutralized and then multiply by the enthalpy per mole.

Wait, but the calculation leads to -11.46 kJ, and the options don't have that. The closest is option D: -16.0 kJ, but that's 4.54 kJ more negative.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the enthalpy of neutralization per mole of water formed, but that's the same as per mole of H+.

Hmm. Maybe I should think about the volumes.

Wait, the volumes are 500 mL, 300 mL, and 200 mL. So the total volume is 1000 mL, but that probably doesn't affect the moles, just the concentrations.

Wait, maybe I'm forgetting something about the reaction stoichiometry. For example, Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, but when it reacts with H2SO4, which is diprotic, the reaction would be:

H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 + 2 H2O.

So this reaction would consume 1 mole of H2SO4 and 1 mole of Ba(OH)2, producing 2 moles of H2O and BaSO4.

So, moles of H2SO4: 0.09, Ba(OH)2: 0.1.

So H2SO4 is the limiting reagent here. So 0.09 moles of H2SO4 would react with 0.09 moles of Ba(OH)2, producing 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles H2O.

But wait, the H+ from H2SO4 is 0.18 moles. But in this reaction, all of the H2SO4's H+ would be neutralized by the OH- from Ba(OH)2.

But wait, HCl is another acid. Its H+ is 0.1 moles. So the HCl's H+ would also react with OH-.

Wait, but wait, when mixing all three solutions, the OH- is from Ba(OH)2, which is 0.2 moles. The H+ comes from both HCl and H2SO4, totaling 0.28 moles.

So the OH- would first neutralize H+ from HCl and H2SO4. So regardless of the individual reactions, the total is the sum.

But perhaps I should think about the net ionic equation: H+ (from all acids) + OH- → H2O.

So the total H+ is 0.28, OH- is 0.2. So 0.2 moles react.

So the enthalpy change is 0.2 * (-57.3) = -11.46 kJ.

But in the options, there's no such option, but option D is -16.0 kJ, which is bigger. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of moles. Let me recalculate each.

HCl: 0.5 L * 0.2 M = 0.1 moles. Correct.

H2SO4: 0.3 L * 0.3 M = 0.09 moles H2SO4. Each produces 2 H+, so 0.18 moles H+. Correct.

Ba(OH)2: 0.2 L * 0.5 M = 0.1 moles. Each gives 2 OH-, so 0.2 moles. Correct.

So that's correct.

Wait, but wait, perhaps the enthalpy of neutralization is given as -57.3 kJ per mole of acid, but H2SO4 is diprotic, so each mole gives two H+. So perhaps the calculation is:

The total moles of H+ is 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28. But only 0.2 reacts, as OH- is 0.2.

So the enthalpy change is 0.2 * (-57.3) = -11.46 kJ.

But the options don't have that. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the options have a typo, or I'm missing something in the problem statement.

Looking at the options again:

A) -2.72 kcal

B) -11.42 kcal

C) -3.80 kcal

D) -16.0 kJ

Wait, if the calculation is in kcal, perhaps I should compute 0.2 moles * 13.66 kcal/mol = 2.732 kcal. So about -2.73 kcal, which is close to option A's -2.72 kcal.

So perhaps the intended answer is option A.

But why would the answer be in kcal? Because the standard enthalpy is often expressed in kJ per mole, but sometimes in kcal.

Wait, 57.3 kJ is approximately 13.66 kcal (since 57.3 /4.184 ≈13.66).

So per mole of H+, it's 13.66 kcal.

So 0.2 moles would be 0.2 *13.66 = 2.732 kcal. So the enthalpy change is -2.73 kcal, which is option A (-2.72 kcal).

Hmm, that makes sense. So perhaps the correct answer is option A.

But wait, another thought. Did I miss any stoichiometric factors?

Wait, the problem asks for the enthalpy of neutralization. The standard value is per mole of reaction, which is usually H+ + OH- → H2O. So each mole of H+ contributes -57.3 kJ or -13.66 kcal.

So 0.2 moles → 0.2 * (-13.66) = -2.732 kcal. Rounded, it's approximately -2.73 kcal. So option A is -2.72, which is very close.

So I think the correct answer is A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when 500 mL 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL 0.3 M H₂SO₄, and 200 mL 0.5 M Ba(OH)₂ are mixed, the following steps are taken:

1. **Calculate moles of H⁺ from acids:**
   - HCl is a monoprotic acid, so each mole contributes 1 H⁺.  
     Moles of HCl = \( 0.2 \, \text{M} \times 0.5 \, \text{L} = 0.1 \, \text{moles} \).  
     Moles of H⁺ from HCl = \( 0.1 \, \text{moles} \).
   - H₂SO₄ is a diprotic acid, so each mole contributes 2 H⁺.  
     Moles of H₂SO₄ = \( 0.3 \, \text{M} \times 0.3 \, \text{L} = 0.09 \, \text{moles} \).  
     Moles of H⁺ from H₂SO₄ = \( 0.09 \times 2 = 0.18 \, \text{moles} \).
   - Total moles of H⁺ = \( 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 \, \text{moles} \).

2. **Calculate moles of OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂:**
   - Ba(OH)₂ dissociates completely, contributing 2 OH⁻ per mole.  
     Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = \( 0.5 \, \text{M} \times 0.2 \, \text{L} = 0.1 \, \text{moles} \).  
     Moles of OH⁻ = \( 0.1 \times 2 = 0.2 \, \text{moles} \).

3. **Determine the limiting reactant:**
   - The reaction is \( \text{H⁺} + \text{OH⁻} \to \text{H₂O} \).  
     Total H⁺ available = \( 0.28 \, \text{moles} \), and total OH⁻ available = \( 0.2 \, \text{moles} \).  
     OH⁻ is the limiting reactant, as it will neutralize \( 0.2 \, \text{moles} \) of H⁺.

4. **Calculate the enthalpy change:**
   - The standard enthalpy of neutralization is approximately \( -57.3 \, \text{kJ/mol} \) or \( -13.66 \, \text{kcal/mol} \) per mole of H⁺.  
     Since \( 0.2 \, \text{moles} \) of H⁺ react, the enthalpy change is:  
     \[
     q = 0.2 \times (-57.3 \, \text{kJ/mol}) = -11.46 \, \text{kJ}
     \]
     Converting to kcal:  
     \[
     q = 0.2 \times (-13.66 \, \text{kcal/mol}) = -2.732 \, \text{kcal}
     \]

5. **Compare with the options:**
   - Option A (\( -2.72 \, \text{kcal} \)) is very close to the calculated value of \( -2.732 \, \text{kcal} \).  
   - Other options are either in the wrong unit (kJ) or do not match the calculated value.

Thus, the correct answer is **A**.

Answer: A
