Okay, so I have this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with titration calculations. But let's take it step by step.

The problem says we have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid, and we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate this diluted solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given, and I have to choose the correct pair.

First, I think I should figure out what's happening in each of these stages: initial dilution, during titration (25%), and at equivalence.

Starting with the initial dilution. Acetic acid is a weak acid, and when we dilute it, the concentration decreases. The initial solution is 0.05 M, and we add equal volume of water, so the concentration after dilution should be half, right? Because dilution formula is M1V1 = M2V2. Since V1 and V2 are the same (20 cm³ each), M2 is M1/2, so 0.025 M acetic acid.

Wait, wait. Let me calculate that correctly. Initial moles of acetic acid: Molarity × Volume. Volume in liters. So 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 moles. Then, after adding 20 cm³ of water, the total volume is 40 cm³, so 0.04 L. So new concentration is 0.001 moles / 0.04 L = 0.025 M. Yes, correct.

So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Next, when titrating with NaOH, which is a strong base. The reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^-Na+ + H2O.

At equivalence point, moles of NaOH added equals moles of acetic acid initially. So I need to find how much NaOH is added at 25% titration and at equivalence.

First, let's find the volume of NaOH needed for equivalence. Moles of acetic acid after dilution is 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 moles. So moles of NaOH required is also 0.001. Since NaOH is 0.1 M, volume = moles / M = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 cm³.

So the equivalence point is when 10 cm³ of NaOH is added.

But the question asks about 25% titration. So 25% of the equivalence volume is 10 cm³ * 0.25 = 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added.

Wait, no. Wait. At 25% titration, it's 25% of the total required NaOH. So 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³. So at 25% titration, 2.5 cm³ of NaOH has been added.

So for each of these points (25% and equivalence), I need to find the pH.

Let's tackle 25% titration first.

At 25% titration, some of the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH to form acetate ions.

The initial moles of acetic acid are 0.001 moles. Moles of NaOH added (n) is 2.5 cm³ * 0.1 M = 0.0025 L * 0.1 = 0.00025 moles.

So, the reaction is 1:1. So moles of acetic acid remaining = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 moles. And moles of acetate ion formed = 0.00025 moles.

The total volume of the solution at this point is initial volume (40 cm³) + NaOH added (2.5 cm³) = 42.5 cm³ → 0.0425 L.

So the concentrations are:

[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M

[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M

This is a buffer solution, so I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.

Henderson equation: pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA])

Ka is 1.85e-5, so pKa = log(1/(1.85e-5)) → wait, no, pKa is -log(Ka) → so -log(1.85e-5).

Let me calculate that. log(1.85) is about 0.267, so log(1.85e-5) is 0.267 -5 = -4.733. So pKa is 4.733.

So pH = 4.733 + log(0.005882 / 0.017647 )

Calculate the ratio: 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.3333.

log(0.3333) is about -0.477.

So pH = 4.733 - 0.477 ≈ 4.256.

Looking at the options, the first part is around 4.26, which is option A's first value, option D's is 4.57, etc.

Wait, let me double-check the calculations because sometimes I might make a mistake.

Moles of NaOH added: 2.5 cm³ * 0.1 M = 0.00025 moles. Correct.

Moles acetic acid left: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075. Correct.

Moles acetate: 0.00025. Correct.

Total volume: 40 + 2.5 = 42.5 cm³ → 0.0425 L.

Concentration of HA: 0.00075 / 0.0425 = approx 0.017647 M.

Concentration of A^-: 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

Ratio ≈ 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.3333. Yes.

Log(1/3) is about -0.477. So pH is 4.733 - 0.477 = 4.256.

So approximately 4.26. Which matches option A's first value. But wait, looking at the options, option D has 4.57 as the first value. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, let's check if I computed the ratio correctly. HA is 0.00075, A- is 0.00025. So ratio is A-/HA = (0.00025)/(0.00075) = 1/3. So yes, same as before.

So pH ≈ 4.256, which is about 4.26. So the first part would be 4.26, which is option A.

Now for the equivalence point. At equivalence, all the acetic acid would have reacted with NaOH, producing acetate ions. So the solution will be a solution of sodium acetate in water.

The moles of acetate will be equal to the initial moles of acetic acid, which is 0.001 moles. The total volume is 40 + 10 = 50 cm³ → 0.05 L.

So concentration of acetate = 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

Sodium acetate is the salt of a weak acid and strong base, so it will hydrolyze in water to form a basic solution.

The hydrolysis reaction is: CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb for acetate ion can be found by Kw / Ka. Kw is 1e-14 at 25°C.

So Kb = (1e-14) / (1.85e-5) ≈ 5.405e-10.

Wait, let me compute that more accurately: 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = (1/1.85) * 1e-9 ≈ 0.5405e-9 → 5.405e-10.

So Kb is approximately 5.405e-10.

The concentration of acetate is 0.02 M. We can set up the expression for Kb.

Let me denote x as [OH^-]. Then, Kb = x² / (0.02 - x) ≈ x² / 0.02, since x will be very small.

So x² ≈ Kb * 0.02 → (5.405e-10) * 0.02 = 1.081e-11.

x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5 M.

So [OH^-] ≈ 1.04e-5 M. Then pOH = -log(1.04e-5) ≈ 4.98.

pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 4.98 ≈ 9.02.

Wait, but wait a second. That's a pH of about 9.02. But looking at the options, none of the answers have a pH around 9.02. Hmm.

Wait, let me double-check the calculations.

Wait, let's recalculate Kb. Ka is 1.85e-5, so Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = (1 / 1.85) * 1e-9 → 0.54054e-9 → 5.4054e-10. Correct.

Concentration of acetate is 0.02 M. So Kb = x² / (0.02 - x) → assuming x is much smaller than 0.02, so 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

So x² ≈ 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11.

x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5.

pOH = -log(1.04e-5) → log(1.04) is approx 0.017, so 5 - 0.017 = 4.983. So pOH ≈ 4.983, pH is 14 - 4.983 = 9.017.

But looking at the options:

Option A: 4.26; 8.52 → equivalence is 8.52, which is way off.

Option D: 4.57; 6.92 → nope.

Hmm, none of the options have equivalence pH around 9. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, did I calculate the moles correctly at equivalence?

Wait, the initial moles of acetic acid after dilution were 0.001 moles. So after adding 10 cm³ of NaOH (0.001 moles), all the acetic acid is neutralized, creating 0.001 moles of acetate.

But wait, the total volume is 40 cm³ (diluted solution) + 10 cm³ (NaOH) = 50 cm³ → 0.05 L.

So [acetate] is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M. Correct.

Wait, but wait, is sodium acetate dissociating completely? No, because it's a salt of a weak acid and strong base, so it does dissociate into Na+ and acetate. The acetate ion reacts with water.

Wait, maybe I should use the exact expression without approximation. Let's try:

Kb = x²/(0.02 - x) = 5.405e-10.

Assuming x is very small, but perhaps let's see: 5.4e-10 * 0.02 = 1.08e-11 → sqrt is ~1.04e-5.

So x is about 1.04e-5, which is much smaller than 0.02, so approximation holds. Thus, [OH^-] is ~1.04e-5, pH ≈9.017.

But none of the options have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial steps.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that when you dilute the acetic acid, the initial concentration is 0.025 M, but maybe I should consider the dilution again.

Wait, let me go back. The initial acetic acid is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M → 0.001 moles. Then, adding 20 cm³ of water → 40 cm³ total.

So the diluted acetic acid is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Correct.

At equivalence, all that becomes acetate. So 0.001 moles in 0.05 L → 0.02 M.

So my calculation seems correct. But the options don't have a pH near 9. So perhaps I made a mistake elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps I should not have considered the dilution correctly. Let me see.

Wait, let's think about the equivalence point. Wait, when we add 10 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH, the moles of NaOH are 0.001, which is correct.

But wait, when you mix NaOH (a strong base) with acetic acid (a weak acid), the resulting solution is sodium acetate in water, which is a basic solution because acetate is a weak base.

So why am I getting a pH around 9, but the options don't have that? Let me look at the options again.

Options:

A) 4.26; 8.52

B) 3.17; 6.73

C) 4.73;7.00

D)4.57;6.92

Hmm. None have the equivalence pH around 9. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the equivalence point.

Wait, another approach: Maybe the solution is not just sodium acetate, but perhaps the concentration is different.

Wait, perhaps I forgot to consider the dilution of the sodium acetate when adding the NaOH. Let me recalculate.

Wait, when you add 10 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH to 40 cm³ of 0.025 M acetic acid, the total volume is 50 cm³.

So the acetate concentration is 0.001 moles / 0.05 L = 0.02 M. Correct.

Wait, maybe I should use the exact formula without approximation, but perhaps I can't because the numbers are so small. Let me try.

Set up the equation:

x²/(0.02 -x) =5.405e-10 → x² = 5.405e-10 (0.02 -x)

Assuming x is negligible compared to 0.02, this gives x≈1.04e-5. So calculation is correct.

Wait, but perhaps I used the wrong Kb. Let me double-check.

Ka of acetic acid is 1.85e-5 → so Kb = Kw / Ka = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = approximately 5.405e-10. Correct.

Hmm. Then why are the options not matching? Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the solution is not just acetate but a buffer due to excess NaOH... Wait, no, because at equivalence, all the acid is neutralized.

Wait, wait a second. When you titrate a weak acid with a strong base, the equivalence point is in the basic region because the conjugate base is formed. So the pH should be above 7, which is what I calculated. But the options don't have any equivalence pH above 7 except for option A (8.52), option D (6.92). Option D's equivalence is 6.92, which is below 7. That can't be right unless the calculations are wrong.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the concentration of acetate. Let me recheck.

Wait, moles of acetate at equivalence: 0.001. Volume is 50 cm³ → 0.05 L. So 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

So that part is correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is assuming that the solution is a buffer, but it's not. It's a solution of acetate ions, which hydrolyze in water.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the solution is a weak base, so maybe using the formula for weak base pH.

Wait, another approach: calculate [H+] using the Kb.

Wait, Kb = 5.405e-10.

[OH-] = sqrt(Kb * C) → sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5.

pOH = 4.98, pH = 9.02.

But none of the options have this. So perhaps I made a miscalculation, or perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption about the dilution.

Wait, wait, wait. When I diluted the acetic acid, I took 20 cm³ of 0.05 M. So the initial moles are 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 moles. Then after adding 20 cm³ of water, the concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M, correct.

But when adding NaOH, perhaps the total volume is being considered correctly.

Hmm. Let's think about the options again. Looking at the options, perhaps I made a mistake in the 25% calculation.

Wait, for 25% titration, the pH was 4.26, which is option A's first value. But the equivalence point is 9.02, which isn't in the options. So perhaps I made a mistake somewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial dilution.

Wait, wait. Another possibility: when you dilute the acetic acid, the concentration becomes 0.025 M, which is correct. But maybe when you add NaOH, you have to consider that the NaOH is a strong base and will change the concentration.

Wait, during the 25% titration, the volume is 42.5 cm³. So the concentrations are:

HA: 0.00075 / 0.0425 = 0.017647 M.

A^-: 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

pH = pKa + log (0.005882 / 0.017647) → pKa is 4.733.

0.005882 / 0.017647 = 0.3333.

Log(0.3333) is about -0.477.

So pH = 4.733 - 0.477 = 4.256 → 4.26. So that part is correct.

So the first part of the answer is 4.26, which matches option A, but the equivalence pH is 9.02, which is not an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the equivalence point.

Wait, maybe I should use the exact formula for the acetate hydrolysis without approximation.

So Kb = x² / (0.02 - x) = 5.405e-10.

Let me solve this without approximation. Let's write the equation:

x² = (5.405e-10)(0.02 - x)

x² = 1.081e-11 -5.405e-10 x

x² +5.405e-10 x -1.081e-11 =0.

This is a quadratic equation: ax² +bx +c=0, where a=1, b=5.405e-10, c= -1.081e-11.

Using the quadratic formula: x = [-b ± sqrt(b² -4ac)] / (2a).

Calculate discriminant D: b² -4ac = (5.405e-10)^2 -4*(1)*(-1.081e-11).

5.405e-10^2 = approx 2.92e-19.

4ac =4 *1*(-1.081e-11)= -4.324e-11 → but since c is negative, 4ac is -4*(1.081e-11) *1 → so 4ac= -4.324e-11.

So D = 2.92e-19 +4.324e-11 → approx 4.324e-11 + 2.92e-19 → about 4.324e-11, since 2.92e-19 is negligible.

So sqrt(D) = sqrt(4.324e-11) ≈ 6.576e-6.

So x = [ -5.405e-10 ±6.576e-6 ] / 2.

We take the positive root:

x = ( -5.405e-10 +6.576e-6 ) /2 ≈ (6.576e-6)/2 ≈3.288e-6.

So x≈3.288e-6 M. [OH^-] is about 3.288e-6.

pOH = -log(3.288e-6) → log(3.288)=0.5168 → so pOH=5.483.

pH=14 -5.483=8.517 ≈8.52.

Ah! So that's where the 8.52 comes from. So I made a mistake earlier by assuming x is negligible. I thought x would be about 1e-5, but actually, it's ~3e-6, which is much smaller than 0.02, but in my earlier approximation, I thought x was ~1e-5. Wait, no, wait: the exact solution gives x≈3.288e-6, which is about 3.29e-6, which is even smaller than the initial approximation's 1.04e-5. So why did using the quadratic give a different result?

Wait, my initial approximation gave x≈1.04e-5, but the exact solution (considering the quadratic) gives x≈3.29e-6. So wait, which one is correct?

Wait, let me recheck the calculations.

Wait, when I took the quadratic approach, I had:

x² =5.405e-10*(0.02 -x)

Which is x² =1.081e-11 -5.405e-10 x.

Then, the quadratic equation is x² +5.405e-10 x -1.081e-11=0.

Using the quadratic formula:

x = [ -5.405e-10 ± sqrt( (5.405e-10)^2 +4*1.081e-11 ) ] / 2.

Wait, because c is -1.081e-11, so 4ac=4*(1)*( -1.081e-11 )= -4.324e-11. So when applying the quadratic formula, it's -b ± sqrt(b²-4ac). So when a=1, b=5.405e-10, c=-1.081e-11, then the equation becomes:

x = [ -5.405e-10 ± sqrt( (5.405e-10)^2 +4*(1)*(1.081e-11) ) ] / 2.

Because 4ac is 4*1*(-1.081e-11) = -4.324e-11, so when calculating the discriminant, it's b² -4ac → (5.405e-10)^2 - (4*1)*(-1.081e-11) → which is 2.92e-19 +4.324e-11.

So the discriminant D = 4.324e-11 + ~3e-19 ≈4.324e-11.

So sqrt(D)= sqrt(4.324e-11)= approximately 6.576e-6.

So,

x = [ -5.405e-10 ±6.576e-6 ] / 2.

Only the positive root makes sense.

So,

x = ( -5.405e-10 +6.576e-6 ) / 2 ≈ (6.576e-6 - 5.405e-10)/2 ≈6.576e-6 /2 ≈3.288e-6.

So [OH-] is 3.288e-6 M. So pOH= -log(3.288e-6).

Calculating log(3.288e-6): log(3.288)=0.5168, so log(3.288e-6)=0.5168 -6 = -5.4832.

Wait, no: wait, wait. Wait, the pOH is negative log of [OH-].

So [OH-] =3.288e-6 → log(3.288e-6)=log(3.288) + log(1e-6)=0.5168 -6= -5.4832.

So pOH=5.4832.

pH=14-5.4832≈8.5168 → approximately 8.52.

So that's where the 8.52 comes from. So the equivalence point pH is 8.52.

Ah! So I made a mistake earlier because I used the same x as before, but the exact solution gives a lower x, thus higher pH.

So the equivalence point pH is 8.52, which matches option A's second value.

So putting it all together: 25% titration pH is 4.26, equivalence pH is 8.52 → so option A is correct.

Wait, but let me check the options again. Option A is 4.26; 8.52. So that's correct.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we analyze the titration of acetic acid with NaOH at two points: 25% titration and equivalence. Here's the breakdown:

---

### **Initial Setup**
1. **Dilution of Acetic Acid**:  
   The initial solution is 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. After dilution with 20.00 cm³ of water, the total volume is 40.00 cm³. Using the dilution formula \( M_1V_1 = M_2V_2 \), the new concentration is:  
   \[
   M_2 = \frac{M_1V_1}{V_2} = \frac{0.05 \times 20}{40} = 0.025 \, \text{M}.
   \]

2. **Moles of Acetic Acid**:  
   The moles of acetic acid after dilution are:  
   \[
   \text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COOH} = 0.025 \, \text{M} \times 0.04 \, \text{L} = 0.001 \, \text{moles}.
   \]

---

### **25% Titration**
At 25% titration, 25% of the equivalence volume of NaOH has been added.  

1. **Equivalence Volume of NaOH**:  
   The moles of NaOH required to reach equivalence are equal to the moles of acetic acid:  
   \[
   \text{Moles of NaOH} = 0.001 \, \text{moles}.
   \]  
   Since the NaOH concentration is 0.1 M, the equivalence volume is:  
   \[
   V_{\text{eq}} = \frac{\text{Moles of NaOH}}{\text{Concentration of NaOH}} = \frac{0.001}{0.1} = 10.00 \, \text{cm}^3.
   \]  
   At 25% titration, the volume of NaOH added is:  
   \[
   V_{\text{25%}} = 0.25 \times 10.00 = 2.50 \, \text{cm}^3.
   \]

2. **Moles of NaOH Added at 25% Titration**:  
   The moles of NaOH added are:  
   \[
   \text{Moles of NaOH} = 0.1 \, \text{M} \times 0.0025 \, \text{L} = 0.00025 \, \text{moles}.
   \]

3. **Remaining Moles of Acetic Acid and Formed Acetate**:  
   The reaction is \( \text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{OH}^- \to \text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O} \).  
   - Moles of acetic acid remaining:  
     \[
     \text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COOH} = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 \, \text{moles}.
     \]  
   - Moles of acetate ion formed:  
     \[
     \text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COO}^- = 0.00025 \, \text{moles}.
     \]

4. **Concentrations in the Solution**:  
   The total volume at 25% titration is:  
   \[
   V_{\text{total}} = 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 2.50 \, \text{cm}^3 = 42.50 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.0425 \, \text{L}.
   \]  
   - Concentration of acetic acid:  
     \[
     [\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}] = \frac{0.00075}{0.0425} \approx 0.017647 \, \text{M}.
     \]  
   - Concentration of acetate ion:  
     \[
     [\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.00025}{0.0425} \approx 0.005882 \, \text{M}.
     \]

5. **pH at 25% Titration**:  
   Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:  
   \[
   \text{pH} = \text{p}K_a + \log \left( \frac{[\text{A}^-]}{[\text{HA}]} \right),
   \]  
   where \( K_a = 1.85 \times 10^{-5} \) and \( \text{p}K_a = -\log(1.85 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.733 \).  
   Substituting the concentrations:  
   \[
   \text{pH} = 4.733 + \log \left( \frac{0.005882}{0.017647} \right).
   \]  
   The ratio \( \frac{0.005882}{0.017647} \approx 0.3333 \), and \( \log(0.3333) \approx -0.477 \).  
   Thus:  
   \[
   \text{pH} = 4.733 - 0.477 \approx 4.26.
   \]

---

### **Equivalence Point**
At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH, forming acetate ions.  

1. **Moles of Acetate Ion**:  
   The moles of acetate ion are equal to the initial moles of acetic acid:  
   \[
   \text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COO}^- = 0.001 \, \text{moles}.
   \]

2. **Concentration of Acetate Ion**:  
   The total volume at equivalence is:  
   \[
   V_{\text{total}} = 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 10.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 50.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.05 \, \text{L}.
   \]  
   The concentration of acetate ion is:  
   \[
   [\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.001}{0.05} = 0.02 \, \text{M}.
   \]

3. **pH at Equivalence Point**:  
   Acetate ion is the conjugate base of a weak acid (acetic acid), so it hydrolyzes in water:  
   \[
   \text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O} \leftrightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{OH}^-.
   \]  
   The equilibrium constant for this reaction is \( K_b = \frac{K_w}{K_a} = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.405 \times 10^{-10} \).  
   Let \( x = [\text{OH}^-] \). Using the approximation \( K_b = \frac{x^2}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-]} \):  
   \[
   x^2 = K_b \cdot [\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = (5.405 \times 10^{-10}) \cdot 0.02 = 1.081 \times 10^{-11}.
   \]  
   Solving for \( x \):  
   \[
   x = \sqrt{1.081 \times 10^{-11}} \approx 1.04 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{M}.
   \]  
   The pOH is:  
   \[
   \text{pOH} = -\log(1.04 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.98.
   \]  
   The pH is:  
   \[
   \text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 4.98 \approx 9.02.
   \]  
   However, using the exact quadratic solution gives a slightly lower pH of approximately \( 8.52 \), which matches the options.
