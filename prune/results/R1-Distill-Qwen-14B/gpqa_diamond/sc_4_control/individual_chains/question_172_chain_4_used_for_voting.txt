Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

The question says that the iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh wait, so the excitation level is higher in star_1. I remember that the excitation of atoms in a star's atmosphere is related to the temperature. Higher temperature stars have more excited atoms because more thermal energy can ionize and excite the atoms.

The energy difference between the energy levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Oh right, that's probably the delta E for the energy levels. I think this relates to the Boltzmann distribution. The Boltzmann factor tells us the relative population of different energy states in a system in thermal equilibrium, which in this case is LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium).

The Boltzmann equation is something like (n_upper)/(n_lower) = (g_upper/g_lower) * exp(-ΔE/(k*T)), where g is the statistical weight and k is Boltzmann's constant. But wait, in this case, the problem states that the excitation is twice as much in star_1. So let me clarify: the number of excited atoms in star_1 is twice that of star_2.

Wait, but the ratio of excitation is given. Let me think. So for star_1, let's say the number of atoms in the excited state is n1, and for star_2, it's n2. The question says n1 = 2 * n2. Or wait, maybe it's the other way around. Oh, wait, the problem says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited as in star_2." So perhaps the excitation level is higher, so n1 = 2 * n2? Or maybe the ratio is n1/n2 = 2.

But wait, the question specifies that the energy difference between the levels is 1.38e-23 J. So that's the ΔE. So assuming that the statistical weights are the same for both stars (since both are iron atoms, same energy levels), the ratio of the populations would be determined by the temperatures of the stars.

So the ratio of the populations (n1/n2) would be equal to (exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) ) / (exp(-ΔE/(k T2)) ) ), because the ratio n_upper/n_lower is proportional to exp(-ΔE/(k T)).

Wait, wait, let's get the formula right. The Boltzmann factor is (n_upper)/(n_lower) = exp( - (E_upper - E_lower)/(k T) ). Since E_upper > E_lower, this ratio is less than 1. But in our case, the ratio of the excitation in star_1 and star_2 is 2, so n1/n2 = 2.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. The question says that in star_1, the atoms are twice as excited. So the number of excited atoms in star_1 is twice that in star_2. So n1 = 2 n2.

So the ratio (n1/n2) = 2.

But according to the Boltzmann equation, n1/n2 = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) / exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) )

Which simplifies to exp( ΔE/(k T2) - ΔE/(k T1) )

So that's exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

So 2 = exp( (ΔE/k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Take the natural logarithm of both sides. ln(2) = (ΔE/k) (1/T2 - 1/T1 )

Wait, but wait, let's double-check that. Let me write it out:

n1 / n2 = (g_upper/g_lower) * exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) / (g_upper/g_lower * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )) )

So the g factors cancel, so it's exp( -ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) )

Which is exp( ΔE/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ) )

So the equation is:

ln(2) = (ΔE / k) ( (1/T2) - (1/T1) )

Wait, but wait, the equation I have is ln(2) equals [ (ΔE/k) * (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) ]

Hmm, but looking at the options, they don't have ΔE or k mentioned. So I think the problem is expecting us to express the relationship between T1 and T2 without the constants. Wait, perhaps we can rearrange the equation.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is more about the ratio of the temperatures given that the excitation is twice as much.

Wait, but wait, let me think again. Let me let T1 and T2 be the temperatures of the two stars.

We have:

ln(2) = (ΔE/k) (1/T2 - 1/T1 )

But in the problem, the question is about which equation for T1 and T2 is correct. So the options are in terms of ln(2) equals some function of T1 and T2. So looking at the options, which one would match this equation?

Let me rearrange the equation I have:

ln(2) = (ΔE/k) (1/T2 - 1/T1 )

Which can be written as:

ln(2) = (ΔE/(k)) * ( (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ) )

Wait, because 1/T2 -1/T1 = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

So substituting:

ln(2) = (ΔE/(k)) * ( (T1 - T2) ) / (T1 T2) )

But none of the options include ΔE or k. So perhaps the options are assuming that (ΔE/(k)) is a given value, but I don't think so. Wait, but the options don't have any constants, so maybe I should think differently.

Wait, perhaps the question is looking for a relation between T1 and T2, assuming that the excitation is twice as much, so the ratio n1/n2=2, leading to the equation I derived.

But the options are in terms of ln(2) equals functions of T1 and T2. Let me look again at the options.

Option D is: ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

Wait, but in my equation, I have (ΔE/(k)) multiplied by that term. So unless (ΔE/k) is equal to 1, which is not the case, option D can't be correct. Because ΔE is given as 1.38e-23 J, and k is approximately 1.38e-23 J/K. Wait! Oh, wait a minute. Let me compute ΔE/(k).

ΔE is 1.38e-23 J. And k is 1.38e-23 J/K. So ΔE/k = (1.38e-23) / (1.38e-23) ) = 1. So ΔE/(k) = 1. Oh, that's a coincidence!

So then, the equation becomes:

ln(2) = (1) * ( (T1 - T2) ) / (T1 T2 )

Which is option D: ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

So option D is the correct equation.

The question involves determining the correct equation relating the effective temperatures of two stars (T₁ and T₂) based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. The problem states that the excitation level of iron atoms in star_1 is twice that of star_2, and the energy difference between the energy levels is given as ΔE = 1.38 × 10⁻²³ J. Using the Boltzmann distribution, the ratio of excitation levels is related to the temperatures of the stars.

The Boltzmann factor for the population ratio of atoms in two energy levels is given by:

\[
\frac{n_1}{n_2} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right) / \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right)
\]

Simplifying, this becomes:

\[
\frac{n_1}{n_2} = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right)
\]

Since the excitation level in star_1 is twice that of star_2, we have \( n_1 / n_2 = 2 \). Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)
\]

Rewriting \( \frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} \) as \( \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} \), the equation becomes:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{\Delta E}{k} \cdot \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}
\]

Notably, \( \Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \) and \( k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K} \), so \( \Delta E / k = 1 \). Substituting this into the equation gives:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}
\]

This matches option D. The other options are incorrect because they do not align with the derived relationship between T₁ and T₂.
