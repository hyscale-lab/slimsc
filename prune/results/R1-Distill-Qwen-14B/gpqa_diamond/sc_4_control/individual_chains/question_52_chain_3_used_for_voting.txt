Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Hmm, let's read it carefully. So, the question is about a star with some spots and how that affects the ratio of neutral Titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels. The options are about the factor by which this ratio changes when the star isn't spotted versus when it is.

Wait, so the initial setup: the star has 1.5 solar radii and 1.1 solar masses. When not covered by spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Oh, right, spots are cooler regions, so when they cover part of the surface, the average temperature goes down.

But the question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels. So, in the photosphere, when the star has spots, this ratio decreases. I need to find the factor by which it changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does. So, the ratio without spots divided by the ratio with spots.

Hmm. Oh, right, in LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), the number of atoms in different energy levels is given by the Boltzmann equation. The ratio of populations is proportional to (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k*T) ), where g1 and g2 are the statistical weights, E is energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is temperature.

Wait, but wait. The problem says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So, when there are spots, the overall photospheric temperature is lower. So, the ratio with spots is lower than without. Thus, the factor without compared to with is (ratio_without)/(ratio_with) = something.

But wait, the problem is about when the star's surface is not covered by spots (Teff 6000 K) and when it is covered (Teff 5500 K). The spots make the overall photospheric effective temperature lower. So, in both cases, we're considering the photosphere at these different Ts.

Wait, but how does this affect the Ti populations? The transition is at 1448 Å, which I think is in the near-ultraviolet or visible. Let's see, 1448 Angstroms is 144.8 nm, which is UV. But how does that relate to the energy levels? The wavelength is related to the energy difference between the two levels. Using E = hc/lambda.

So, the energy difference delta E = hc / lambda. Let me compute that. h is Planck's constant (6.626e-34 J s), c is 3e8 m/s, lambda is 1448e-10 m. So delta E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1.448e-7) ≈ (1.9878e-25) / (1.448e-7) ≈ 1.372e-18 J per photon.

But to get this in terms of thermal energy, we can compute delta E / (k*T), where k is Boltzmann constant (1.38e-23 J/K). So let's compute that for both temperatures.

Wait, but first, let me think about the ratio. The ratio of the number of atoms in level 2 to level 1 is (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2-E1)/(k T) ). But since the problem is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two specific levels, I think they're considering the same transition, so E2 is higher than E1. So E2-E1 is positive.

Wait, but the problem says the ratio decreases when the star has spots, i.e., when the Teff is lower. So, when T decreases, what happens to the ratio N2/N1?

Let me think: the ratio is proportional to exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) ), multiplied by the statistical weights ratio. If the statistical weights are the same, then the ratio is just exp( -delta E/(k T) ). So, when T decreases, the exponent becomes more negative, so the ratio decreases. Wait, because delta E is positive, so the exponent is negative, and as T goes down, the denominator gets smaller, making the entire exponent more negative. So exp of a more negative number is smaller. So the ratio would decrease. Which matches the problem statement: when the star has spots (lower temperature), the ratio decreases.

But the question is about the factor by which the ratio changes when without spots compared to with spots. So, (N2/N1)_no_spots / (N2/N1)_with_spots.

Let me denote this as R = (N2/N1)_T=6000K / (N2/N1)_T=5500K.

So R = [ (g2/g1) exp( -delta E/(k*6000) ) ] / [ (g2/g1) exp( -delta E/(k*5500) ) ].

The g2/g1 terms cancel out, so R = exp( delta E/(k) [ 1/(5500) - 1/(6000) ] ).

Wait, let me compute the exponent step by step. Let me compute (delta E / k) [ (1/5500) - (1/6000) ].

Wait, no. Let me think again. The exponent is delta E/(k T), but when you take the ratio, let me see:

At 6000 K, the exponent is -delta E/(k*6000), and at 5500 K, it's -delta E/(k*5500). When you take the ratio, the exponents subtract.

So R = exp( (delta E/(k)) * (1/5500 - 1/6000) ) ).

Wait, wait, let me recast that. Let me write the exponents:

Exponent for 6000 K: -x/6000, where x = delta E/(k)
Exponent for 5500 K: -x/5500
So the ratio is [exp(-x/6000)] / [exp(-x/5500)] = exp( x (1/5500 - 1/6000) )

Because dividing exponents subtracts them: exp(a)/exp(b) = exp(a - b). So, a is -x/6000, b is -x/5500. So a - b = (-x/6000) - (-x/5500) ) = x ( 1/5500 - 1/6000 )

Yes. So R = exp( x (1/5500 - 1/6000) )

x is delta E/(k). Let me compute x first.

Compute delta E: 1.372e-18 J per photon (from earlier calculation).

k is 1.38e-23 J/K.

So x = delta E / k = (1.372e-18) / (1.38e-23) ≈ (1.372 / 1.38) * 1e5 ≈ approximately 1e5 (since 1.372 ≈ 1.38, so their ratio is about 1). So x ≈ 1e5 K.

Wait, let me compute it more accurately.

1.372e-18 / 1.38e-23 = (1.372 / 1.38) * (1e-18 / 1e-23) )= approx 0.994 * 1e5 = ~99,400 K.

So x ≈ 99,400 K.

Now, compute (1/5500 - 1/6000) = (6000 - 5500) / (5500 * 6000) ) = 500 / (33,000,000) ) = 5 / 330,000 = 1 / 66,000.

So x*(1/5500 - 1/6000) ) ≈ 99,400 * (1/66,000) ≈ (99,400 / 66,000) ) ≈ 1.506.

So the exponent is about 1.506. So R = exp(1.506) ≈ e^1.506 is about 4.5.

Wait, e^1 is 2.718, e^1.5 is around 4.4817. So 1.506 is a little more than 1.5, so maybe around 4.5.

So R is approximately 4.5.

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure I did the math correctly.

Compute 1/5500 - 1/6000.

1/5500 = approx 0.000181818...
1/6000 = approx 0.000166666...
Subtract: 0.000181818 - 0.000166666 = 0.000015152.

Wait, wait no, wait: 1/5500 is approximately 0.0001818, 1/6000 is approximately 0.0001666. So 1/5500 - 1/6000 is positive, about 0.00001515.

So (delta E/k) * (1/5500 - 1/6000) = x * 0.00001515.

Wait, x is approximately 99400 K.

So 99400 * 0.00001515 ≈ 99400 * 1.515e-5 ≈ 99400 * 1.515e-5.

Let me compute that.

99400 * 1.515e-5 = (99400) * (0.00001515) = ?

Compute 99400 * 0.00001515:

0.00001515 is 1.515e-5.

99400 * 1.515e-5 = (99400 * 1.515) * 1e-5.

Compute 99400 * 1.515:

Hmm, 99400 * 1.5 = 149,100.

99400 * 0.015 = 1,491.

So total is 149,100 + 1,491 = 150,591.

Multiply by 1e-5: 150,591 * 1e-5 = 1.50591.

So exponent is approximately 1.50591.

So R = e^(1.50591) ≈ e^1.506 ≈ 4.503.

So the factor is approximately 4.5. So the ratio without spots is about 4.5 times higher than when it has spots.

Looking back at the options, option C is ~4.5. So the answer should be C.

To determine the factor by which the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it does, we use the Boltzmann equation. The ratio of populations in two energy levels is given by:

\[
\frac{N_2}{N_1} \propto \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT}\right),
\]

where \( \Delta E \) is the energy difference between the levels, \( k \) is the Boltzmann constant, and \( T \) is the temperature. The problem specifies that the ratio decreases when the star has spots, meaning the temperature drops from \( T_1 = 6000 \, \text{K} \) (no spots) to \( T_2 = 5500 \, \text{K} \) (spots present). The factor by which the ratio changes is:

\[
R = \frac{\left(\frac{N_2}{N_1}\right)_{T_1}}{\left(\frac{N_2}{N_1}\right)_{T_2}} = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right).
\]

### Step 1: Compute \( \Delta E \)
The energy difference \( \Delta E \) is related to the wavelength of the transition (\( \lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å} = 1.448 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m} \)) by:

\[
\Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda},
\]

where \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \) and \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \). Substituting:

\[
\Delta E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3 \times 10^8)}{1.448 \times 10^{-7}} \approx 1.372 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J}.
\]

### Step 2: Compute \( \frac{\Delta E}{k} \)
The Boltzmann constant is \( k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K} \). Thus:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} = \frac{1.372 \times 10^{-18}}{1.38 \times 10^{-23}} \approx 99,400 \, \text{K}.
\]

### Step 3: Compute \( \frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} \)
The temperatures are \( T_1 = 6000 \, \text{K} \) and \( T_2 = 5500 \, \text{K} \). Therefore:

\[
\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} = \frac{1}{5500} - \frac{1}{6000} = \frac{6000 - 5500}{5500 \times 6000} = \frac{500}{33,000,000} \approx 1.515 \times 10^{-5}.
\]

### Step 4: Compute the exponent
The exponent in the Boltzmann factor is:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right) = (99,400)(1.515 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 1.506.
\]

### Step 5: Compute \( R \)
The factor \( R \) is:

\[
R = \exp(1.506) \approx 4.5.
\]

### Conclusion
The ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in the two energy levels when the star does not have spots compared to when it does is approximately **4.5**. This corresponds to option **C**.
