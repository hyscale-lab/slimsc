Okay, so I've got this question about stellar abundances, and I'm a bit confused, but let's try to break it down step by step. Hmm, the question involves two stars, Star_1 and Star_2, each with different masses. But wait, maybe the masses don't directly affect the abundance ratios? Or do they? I'm not sure, but maybe the key is in the given elemental abundance ratios.

The given data includes [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex, [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex, and some [Fe/H] and [Mg/H] values. Oh, right, the brackets mean logarithmic abundances relative to the Sun. So [X/Y] = log(nX/nY) - log(nX/nY)_sun. So [Fe/H]_1 is 0, which means the iron abundance relative to hydrogen is the same as in the Sun. Same for [Mg/H]_2 being 0.

The photospheric composition of the Sun is given: 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5. Wait, that simplifies to log(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5. So nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5). Similarly for Mg, 12 + log(nMg/nH) =7, so log(nMg/nH) = -5. So nMg/nH = 10^-5.

We need to find the ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 and Star_2. So [nSi1/(nSi2)].

Wait, but how do we get nSi for each star? Let me think about the given ratios.

For Star 1: [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3. Since [Fe/H]_1 is 0, that means [Fe/H] is 0, so the ratio of Fe to H is the same as in the Sun. So [Fe/H] = log(nFe/nH) - log(nFe/nH)_sun =0. So nFe1/nH1 = nFe_sun /nH_sun.

Wait, but Star 1's Fe abundance is the same as the Sun's, so nFe1 = nFe_sun * (nH1/nH_sun). Wait, but I'm not sure because in stars, the total hydrogen might not be the same as the Sun's, but maybe the problem assumes that the H abundance is the same? Or perhaps we can express ratios relative to H.

Wait, the question is about the photospheric composition. So for Star 1, [Fe/H]_1 is 0, so the Fe abundance relative to H is the same as the Sun. So nFe1/nH1 = nFe_sun / nH_sun.

Similarly, for Mg in Star 2, [Mg/H]_2 is 0, so nMg2/nH2 = nMg_sun / nH_sun.

But wait, I'm trying to find the ratio of Si in each star, nSi1 and nSi2.

So for Star 1, [Si/Fe]_1 is 0.3. That is, log(nSi1/nFe1) - log(nSi_sun/nFe_sun) =0.3.

Because [Si/Fe] = log(nSi/nFe) - log(nSi/nFe)_sun.

So, log(nSi1/nFe1) = 0.3 + log(nSi_sun/nFe_sun).

Similarly, nFe1/nH1 = nFe_sun /nH_sun. So nFe1 = (nFe_sun /nH_sun) * nH1.

Putting it together, nSi1/nFe1 = (nSi_sun/nFe_sun) * 10^0.3.

So nSi1 = nFe1 * (nSi_sun / nFe_sun) * 10^0.3.

But nFe1 = (nFe_sun /nH_sun) * nH1.

So substituting, nSi1 = [nFe_sun /nH_sun * nH1] * [nSi_sun/nFe_sun] * 10^0.3.

The nFe_sun cancels out.

nSi1 = (nH1 /nH_sun) * (nSi_sun / nFe_sun) *10^0.3.

Wait, but nH1 in Star 1 is the same as nH_sun? Because [Fe/H] is 0, so nFe1/nH1 = nFe_sun/nH_sun. So if the ratio is the same, it implies that the H abundance is the same? Or wait, maybe not exactly, but perhaps the H in the star is scaled by the same factor as Fe. Hmm, but for the purpose of this problem, perhaps we can assume that nH1 = nH_sun? Or not?

Alternatively, perhaps the H is the same, but I'm not sure. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think in terms of ratios.

For Star 1, [Fe/H] =0, so [Fe/H] = log(nFe/nH) - [Fe/H]_sun = 0.

So nFe1/nH1 = nFe_sun/nH_sun. So nFe1 = nFe_sun * (nH1 / nH_sun).

Similarly, [Si/Fe]_1 =0.3, so log(nSi1/nFe1) = 0.3 + log(nSi_sun/nFe_sun).

Which means nSi1/nFe1 =10^(0.3) * (nSi_sun/nFe_sun).

So nSi1 = nFe1 * 10^0.3 * (nSi_sun / nFe_sun).

Substituting nFe1 from earlier: nFe1 = (nFe_sun /nH_sun) *nH1.

So nSi1 = (nFe_sun /nH_sun *nH1) * 10^0.3 * (nSi_sun /nFe_sun).

The nFe_sun cancels, so nSi1 = (nH1 /nH_sun) *10^0.3 * (nSi_sun).

Wait, nSi_sun is the solar silicon abundance. So perhaps we can express nSi1 in terms of nH1.

But what about nH1 relative to the Sun? Maybe the total H in the star is the same as the Sun, but I'm not given that. Hmm, perhaps I don't need to worry about nH because it's about ratios. Let's see.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express everything relative to the Sun's composition.

Wait, perhaps I should instead express the abundance ratios in terms of the Sun's.

Let me think about Star 1.

For Star 1:

[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3.

So log10(nSi1 / nFe1) - log10(nSi_sun / nFe_sun) =0.3.

Which is log(nSi1/nFe1) = 0.3 + log(nSi_sun/nFe_sun).

Thus, nSi1/nFe1 = (nSi_sun/nFe_sun) *10^0.3.

So nSi1 = nFe1 * (nSi_sun /nFe_sun) *10^0.3.

But nFe1 = (nFe_sun/nH_sun) *nH1.

So substituting:

nSi1 = [ (nFe_sun /nH_sun) *nH1 ] * (nSi_sun /nFe_sun) *10^0.3.

The nFe_sun cancels.

nSi1 = (nH1 / nH_sun) * nSi_sun *10^0.3.

Let me compute 10^0.3. 10^0.3 is about 2.

Wait, 10^0.3 is approximately 2, yes. Because 10^0.3010 is about 2. So 10^0.3 ≈2.

So nSi1 = (nH1 / nH_sun) * nSi_sun *2.

But wait, from the Sun's data, 12 + log(nFe/nH) =7.5 → log(nFe/nH)= -4.5 → nFe/nH =1e-4.5.

Similarly for Mg, 12 + log(nMg/nH) =7 → log(nMg/nH)= -5 → nMg/nH=1e-5.

So in the Sun, nSi is another value. Wait, do I know the solar abundance of Si? Because the question gives the Fe and Mg, but not Si. Hmm. Maybe I need to find the solar [Si/Fe] and [Mg/Si] to get Si.

Wait, for the Sun, [X/Y] = log(nX/nY) - log(nX/nY)_sun.

Wait no, the [X/Y] is log(nX/nY) - log(nX/nY)_sun. So if [X/Y]_sun is zero.

Wait, no. For the Sun, any [X/Y]_sun is zero because it's log(nX/nY) - log(nX/nY)_sun. So for the Sun, [X/Y] is zero. So for the Sun, [Si/Fe] =0, [Mg/Si]=0.

But in the problem, Star_1 has [Si/Fe]=0.3, which is higher than the Sun. So Star_1 is Si-enhanced relative to Fe.

Wait, but how does that help us find the ratio of Si in each star?

Wait, perhaps I can find the ratio of Si in each star relative to the Sun.

Wait, let's think again. For Star_1:

nSi1 = (nH1 /nH_sun) * 2 * nSi_sun.

Wait, but I don't know nH1 relative to the Sun. Hmm, maybe we can relate it through the total number of atoms or another way.

Wait, but maybe the H abundance in each star is the same as in the Sun because [Fe/H]_1 is zero. So if [Fe/H] is zero, then nFe1/nH1 = nFe_sun/nH_sun. So nFe1 = (nFe_sun/nH_sun) *nH1.

If nH1 =nH_sun, then nFe1 = nFe_sun. But I don't know if that's the case. Because in the Sun, the total number of H is nH_sun, but in the star, the number could be different. Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the H is the same as the Sun's, but that's an assumption I can't make without more info.

Alternatively, perhaps the [Fe/H] is zero, so the number of Fe is same as the Sun relative to H, but H could be different. So if [Fe/H] is zero, then nFe1 = nFe_sun * (nH1 / nH_sun).

So, the number of Fe in Star_1 is scaled by the ratio of H in Star_1 to H in the Sun. But I don't know how much H is present in each star, so perhaps the problem is designed in a way that the H cancels out? Let me think.

Wait, the question asks for the ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 and Star_2. So we need to find nSi1 / nSi2.

So perhaps I can express nSi1 and nSi2 in terms of their respective H, and then the H will cancel when taking the ratio.

Let's proceed.

For Star 1, nSi1 = (nH1 / nH_sun) * 2 * nSi_sun.

Wait, but I need to include more precise expressions.

Wait, for Star 1:

[Si/Fe]_1 =0.3 → log(nSi1/nFe1) =0.3 + log(nSi_sun/nFe_sun).

Which is: nSi1/nFe1 = 10^0.3 * (nSi_sun /nFe_sun).

So nSi1 = nFe1 * (nSi_sun /nFe_sun) *10^0.3.

But nFe1 = (nFe_sun /nH_sun) *nH1.

So substituting:

nSi1 = (nFe_sun /nH_sun *nH1) * (nSi_sun /nFe_sun) *10^0.3.

nFe_sun cancels.

nSi1 = (nH1 /nH_sun) * (nSi_sun) *10^0.3.

Similarly, for Star_2:

[Mg/Si]_2 =0.3.

Let me write that as log(nMg2/nSi2) - log(nMg_sun/nSi_sun) =0.3.

So log(nMg2/nSi2) =0.3 + log(nMg_sun/nSi_sun).

Thus, nMg2/nSi2 =10^0.3 * (nMg_sun /nSi_sun).

We need to find nSi2.

But wait, we also have [Mg/H]_2=0, which is log(nMg2/nH2) - log(nMg_sun/nH_sun) =0.

So nMg2/nH2 = nMg_sun /nH_sun → nMg2 = (nMg_sun /nH_sun) *nH2.

Substituting into the [Mg/Si]_2 equation:

(nMg_sun /nH_sun *nH2) /nSi2 =10^0.3 * (nMg_sun /nSi_sun).

Rearranging:

nSi2 = (nMg_sun /nH_sun *nH2) / [10^0.3 * (nMg_sun /nSi_sun)].

Simplify:

nSi2 = (nH2 /nH_sun) * (nSi_sun /10^0.3) * (nMg_sun /nMg_sun) → nMg_sun cancels.

Wait, no: the (nMg_sun /nH_sun) is in the numerator, and (nMg_sun /nSi_sun) is in the denominator from the right-hand side. So:

nSi2 = [ (nMg_sun /nH_sun) * nH2 ] / [ 10^0.3 * (nMg_sun /nSi_sun) ) ]

Which can be rewritten as:

nSi2 = [ (nH2) / (nH_sun) ) ] * (nSi_sun /10^0.3) ) * (nMg_sun /nMg_sun) → no, let me do it step by step.

Wait, denominator is [10^0.3 * (nMg_sun / nSi_sun)].

So nSi2 = ( (nMg_sun /nH_sun) *nH2 ) / (10^0.3 * (nMg_sun/nSi_sun) ) )

The nMg_sun cancels in numerator and denominator. So:

nSi2 = (nH2/(nH_sun)) * (nSi_sun) / (10^0.3).

So nSi2 = (nH2/nH_sun) * nSi_sun / 2 (since 10^0.3 ≈2).

So now, we have:

nSi1 = (nH1/nH_sun) * nSi_sun *2.

nSi2 = (nH2/nH_sun) *nSi_sun /2.

So the ratio nSi1/nSi2 would be [ (nH1/nH_sun) *2 *nSi_sun ] / [ (nH2/nH_sun)*nSi_sun /2 ]

Simplify. The nH_sun and nSi_sun cancel out.

So:

nSi1/nSi2 = [nH1 *2] / [nH2 * (1/2)] ] = (2 * 2 * nH1 ) / (nH2) ) = (4 nH1 )/(nH2).

So the ratio depends on nH1 and nH2.

But wait, how do we find nH1 and nH2? Hmm, the problem doesn't give [H/Fe] or anything else. Unless there's another approach.

Wait, perhaps the total number of heavy elements (metals) is the same, but I don't think that's stated. Alternatively, maybe each star's overall composition is such that the H is the same as the Sun? No, because [Fe/H] is zero, but that just means Fe is same as H. But H itself could be same or different.

Wait, but in the Sun, the number of H is nH_sun, and in each star, nH can be different. But without knowing anything else, perhaps we can assume that the H in each star is the same as the Sun's. Because otherwise, we can't proceed. So perhaps nH1 = nH_sun and nH2 =nH_sun.

Wait, if that's the case, then nH1 =nH_sun, nH2 =nH_sun.

So nSi1/nSi2 =4 * (nH1)/(nH2) )=4*(1/1)=4.

But wait, that would give a ratio of 4. But looking at the options, A is ~3.9, which is close. But let me think again.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the assumption that [Fe/H]_1=0 implies nH1 =nH_sun. Because [Fe/H] is log(nFe/nH) - log(nFe/nH)_sun =0.

Which implies that nFe1/nH1 =nFe_sun/nH_sun.

So, nFe1 = (nFe_sun/nH_sun) *nH1.

But without knowing nH1, how can we proceed? So perhaps the ratio nFe1/nH1 is the same as in the Sun, but the absolute H can be different.

Wait, but in that case, how do we find nH1 and nH2?

Wait, maybe the two stars have the same metallicity? Or perhaps the problem is designed so that the H abundance is same as the Sun, but I don't know.

Alternatively, perhaps the H abundance is the same. Let me proceed with the assumption that nH1 =nH_sun and nH2 =nH_sun. Then, the ratio would be 4, but looking at the options, option A is ~3.9, which is close. So perhaps that's the answer.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps because the problem uses the EW method and assumes LTE, but I'm not sure how that affects the calculations.

Wait, another approach: express the silicon abundance in each star relative to the Sun.

For Star 1:

[Si/Fe]_1 =0.3 → [Si/Fe] = log(Si/Fe) - log(Sun's Si/Fe) =0.3 → log(Si/Fe) = 0.3 + log(Sun's Si/Fe).

But the Sun's [Si/Fe] is zero, so log(Si/Fe) =0.3 → Si/Fe =10^0.3.

Since [Fe/H]_1 is zero, Fe/H is same as Sun → Fe = (Fe_sun) * (H1 / H_sun).

So, Si1 = Fe1 * (10^0.3) = (Fe_sun * H1/H_sun) *10^0.3.

But Si_sun = Fe_sun * (Si_sun/Fe_sun) → because in the Sun, [Si/Fe] is zero, so (Si/Fe)_sun is 1.

Wait, no, wait. [Si/Fe]_sun is zero, which means log(Si_sun/Fe_sun) =0 → Si_sun/Fe_sun =1 → Si_sun = Fe_sun.

So, Si1 = Fe_sun * (H1/H_sun) *10^0.3.

But in the Sun, Si_sun = Fe_sun → so Si1 = (Si_sun) * (H1/H_sun) *10^0.3.

Similarly, for Star 2:

[Mg/Si]_2 =0.3 → log(Mg/Si) = 0.3 + log(Mg_sun/Si_sun).

But in the Sun, [Mg/Si] is zero → Mg_sun/Si_sun =1 → Mg2/Si2 =10^0.3.

Also, [Mg/H]_2=0 → Mg2 = Mg_sun * (H2/H_sun).

So, Mg2 = Mg_sun * (H2 / H_sun).

Putting that into the [Mg/Si] equation:

Mg2/Si2 =10^0.3 → (Mg_sun * H2/H_sun)/Si2 =10^0.3.

Since Mg_sun = Si_sun (from Sun's [Mg/Si]=0), so:

(Si_sun * H2/H_sun) / Si2 =10^0.3 → Si2 = (Si_sun * H2)/(H_sun *10^0.3).

Now, the ratio of Si1 to Si2 is:

Si1/Si2 = [ (Si_sun * H1/H_sun *10^0.3) ] / [ (Si_sun * H2)/(H_sun *10^0.3) ) ]

Simplify:

= [ H1 *10^0.3 * H_sun *10^0.3 ] / [ H2 * H_sun ) ]

H_sun cancels.

= [ H1 * (10^0.3)^2 ] / H2.

= H1/H2 * (10^0.6).

Wait, 10^0.6 is about 3.98, approximately 4.

So the ratio is (H1/H2) *4.

But without knowing H1 and H2, how can we proceed? Unless H1 = H2, which would make the ratio 4.

But I don't think that's necessarily the case. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem assumes that the hydrogen abundance is the same in both stars as in the Sun, so H1=H_sun and H2=H_sun.

Then, the ratio is 4, which is approximately option A (3.9).

Wait, but 10^0.6 is about 3.98, which is ~4. So the ratio would be 3.98, which is option A.

But wait, let me re-examine the initial setup. For Star_1, [Fe/H] is 0, so nFe1/nH1 =nFe_sun/nH_sun. So nFe1 = (nFe_sun/nH_sun) * nH1.

Similarly, for Star_2, [Mg/H] is 0, so nMg2/nH2 =nMg_sun/nH_sun → nMg2 = (nMg_sun/nH_sun)*nH2.

But I'm trying to find nSi1 and nSi2. From the two stars' [Si/Fe] and [Mg/Si], which relate their Si and Mg abundances to Fe and each other.

Wait, perhaps another approach is to express all abundances in terms of H.

For Star_1:

[Fe/H]_1 =0 → nFe1/nH1 =nFe_sun/nH_sun. So nFe1 =nFe_sun * (nH1/nH_sun).

[Si/Fe]_1 =0.3 → log(nSi1/nFe1) =0.3 → nSi1 =nFe1 *10^0.3.

Substituting nFe1: nSi1 =nFe_sun * (nH1/nH_sun) *10^0.3.

But nFe_sun =nH_sun * (nFe_sun/nH_sun) → since nFe_sun/nH_sun is a solar ratio.

Wait, but in the Sun, nFe_sun = (nFe_sun/nH_sun) *nH_sun.

So, substituting:

nSi1 = [ (nFe_sun/nH_sun) *nH_sun ] * (nH1/nH_sun) *10^0.3.

Simplify:

= (nFe_sun/nH_sun) *nH1 *10^0.3.

= nFe_sun * (nH1/(nH_sun)^2) *10^0.3.

Wait, that might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps express nSi1 in terms of nH1.

Wait, perhaps we can find nSi1 in terms of nH1 and nH_sun.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed so that the H abundance doesn't affect the ratio of the two silicon abundances, so the ratio depends only on the given abundance ratios.

Wait, but I'm stuck because I can't find a way to get the ratio without knowing H1 and H2. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: the ratio of silicon in Star_1 to Star_2 is (nSi1/nSi2).

From earlier, I had:

nSi1 = (nH1/nH_sun) *nSi_sun *10^0.3.

nSi2 = (nH2/nH_sun) *nSi_sun /10^0.3.

So nSi1/nSi2 = (nH1/nH2) * (10^0.3 *10^0.3) ) = (nH1/nH2) *10^0.6.

Which is (nH1/nH2) *3.98.

But without knowing nH1/nH2, I can't proceed. So perhaps the problem assumes that nH1 =nH2 =nH_sun. Then the ratio is 3.98, which is about 4, so option A.

But why would the problem assume that? Because the stars have different masses, but maybe that's irrelevant for the photospheric composition. Alternatively, perhaps the H abundance in each star is the same as the Sun's.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed such that nH1 and nH2 don't affect the ratio because each star's nH cancels out when considering their own ratios.

Wait, but in the expression I have, the ratio depends on nH1 and nH2. So unless nH1 =nH2, the ratio wouldn't be 4. But we don't have information about that.

Hmm, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe I should express nSi1 and nSi2 relative to the Sun's nSi.

Wait, let's think in terms of the Sun's composition.

In the Sun:

nFe_sun = (nFe/nH)_sun *nH_sun.

Similarly, nMg_sun = (nMg/nH)_sun *nH_sun.

And nSi_sun = (nSi/nH)_sun *nH_sun.

But from the Sun's data:

12 + log(nFe/nH) =7.5 → log(nFe/nH) =-4.5 → nFe/nH =1e-4.5 → nFe =nH *1e-4.5.

Similarly, nMg/nH =1e-5 →nMg= nH *1e-5.

But what about nSi? The question doesn't provide nSi/nH for the Sun. Hmm. So maybe I can't proceed this way.

Wait, perhaps the key is that for Star 1, [Fe/H]=0 and [Si/Fe]=0.3, so [Si/H] = [Si/Fe] + [Fe/H] =0.3+0=0.3. So [Si/H]_1=0.3. That would mean that silicon abundance is 10^0.3 times higher than the Sun's relative to H.

Similarly, for Star 2, [Mg/Si]=0.3. But [Mg/H]_2=0, so [Mg/Si]_2 =0.3 → [Mg/H]_2 = [Mg/Si]_2 + [Si/H]_2 → 0 =0.3 + [Si/H]_2 → [Si/H]_2 = -0.3.

So, the silicon abundance in Star_2 is 10^-0.3 times that of the Sun relative to H.

So, nSi1/nH1 =10^0.3 * (nSi_sun/nH_sun).

nSi2/nH2 =10^-0.3 * (nSi_sun /nH_sun).

So, the ratio nSi1/nSi2 = (nH1/nH2) * (10^0.3 /10^-0.3) ) = (nH1/nH2) *10^0.6.

But again, without knowing nH1/nH2, I can't find the ratio. So perhaps the problem assumes that nH1 =nH2, which would make the ratio 10^0.6 ≈3.98.

So that would be option A.

But why would nH1 =nH2? Because the problem doesn't state that the stars have the same H abundance. However, perhaps in the problem, the H abundance is the same as the Sun's for both stars, which would make nH1 =nH_sun and nH2 =nH_sun.

So, then nH1/nH2 =1, and the ratio nSi1/nSi2 =10^0.6 ≈3.98, which is ~3.9. So the answer would be A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2, we analyze the given elemental abundance data and use the relationships provided.

### Key Information:
1. **Star_1**:
   - [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex, meaning the silicon-to-iron ratio in Star_1 is 10^0.3 times higher than in the Sun.
   - [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex, meaning the iron-to-hydrogen ratio in Star_1 is the same as in the Sun.

2. **Star_2**:
   - [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex, meaning the magnesium-to-silicon ratio in Star_2 is 10^0.3 times higher than in the Sun.
   - [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex, meaning the magnesium-to-hydrogen ratio in Star_2 is the same as in the Sun.

3. **Solar Composition**:
   - 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 → log10(nFe/nH) = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^-4.5.
   - 12 + log10(nMg/nH) = 7 → log10(nMg/nH) = -5 → nMg/nH = 10^-5.
   - Silicon-to-hydrogen ratio in the Sun is not explicitly provided, but it can be derived from the relationships.

### Analysis:
#### Star_1:
- From [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3, we have:
  \[
  \log_{10}(n_{\text{Si1}} / n_{\text{Fe1}}) = 0.3 + \log_{10}(n_{\text{SiSun}} / n_{\text{FeSun}})
  \]
  Since [Si/Fe] in the Sun is 0, this simplifies to:
  \[
  n_{\text{Si1}} / n_{\text{Fe1}} = 10^{0.3} \cdot (n_{\text{SiSun}} / n_{\text{FeSun}})
  \]
  Substituting \( n_{\text{Fe1}} = n_{\text{FeSun}} \cdot (n_{\text{H1}} / n_{\text{HSun}}) \) (from [Fe/H]_1 = 0), we get:
  \[
  n_{\text{Si1}} = n_{\text{FeSun}} \cdot (n_{\text{H1}} / n_{\text{HSun}}) \cdot 10^{0.3} \cdot (n_{\text{SiSun}} / n_{\text{FeSun}})
  \]
  Simplifying:
  \[
  n_{\text{Si1}} = (n_{\text{H1}} / n_{\text{HSun}}) \cdot n_{\text{SiSun}} \cdot 10^{0.3}
  \]

#### Star_2:
- From [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3, we have:
  \[
  \log_{10}(n_{\text{Mg2}} / n_{\text{Si2}}) = 0.3 + \log_{10}(n_{\text{MgSun}} / n_{\text{SiSun}})
  \]
  Since [Mg/Si] in the Sun is 0, this simplifies to:
  \[
  n_{\text{Mg2}} / n_{\text{Si2}} = 10^{0.3} \cdot (n_{\text{MgSun}} / n_{\text{SiSun}})
  \]
  Substituting \( n_{\text{Mg2}} = n_{\text{MgSun}} \cdot (n_{\text{H2}} / n_{\text{HSun}}) \) (from [Mg/H]_2 = 0), we get:
  \[
  n_{\text{Si2}} = (n_{\text{H2}} / n_{\text{HSun}}) \cdot n_{\text{SiSun}} / 10^{0.3}
  \]

#### Ratio of Silicon Atoms:
The ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 to Star_2 is:
\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si1}}}{n_{\text{Si2}}} = \frac{(n_{\text{H1}} / n_{\text{HSun}}) \cdot n_{\text{SiSun}} \cdot 10^{0.3}}{(n_{\text{H2}} / n_{\text{HSun}}) \cdot n_{\text{SiSun}} / 10^{0.3}}
\]
Simplifying:
\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si1}}}{n_{\text{Si2}}} = \frac{n_{\text{H1}}}{n_{\text{H2}}} \cdot 10^{0.6}
\]

#### Assumption:
The problem does not specify the hydrogen abundance in the stars, so we assume \( n_{\text{H1}} = n_{\text{H2}} = n_{\text{HSun}} \). This assumption simplifies the ratio to:
\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si1}}}{n_{\text{Si2}}} = 10^{0.6}
\]
Since \( 10^{0.6} \approx 3.98 \), the ratio is approximately **3.9**.

### Conclusion:
The ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 to Star_2 is approximately **3.9**.
