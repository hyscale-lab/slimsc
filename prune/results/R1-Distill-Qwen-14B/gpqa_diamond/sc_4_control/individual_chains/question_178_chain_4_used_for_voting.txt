Okay, so I have this question about a Lagrangian and whether the theory is renormalizable. Hmm, I remember that renormalizability depends on the mass dimensions of the coupling constants. Let me think through this step by step.

The Lagrangian given is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. Oh wait, σ_{μν} is (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν], which I think are the antisymmetric products of gamma matrices. And F^{μν} is the field strength tensor for electromagnetism or something similar.

First, I need to find the mass dimension of κ. To do that, I should figure out the dimension of each field in the Lagrangian because the Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4 in four spacetime dimensions (since action is dimensionless, and we integrate d^4x which is dimension 4).

The fields involved are ψ (a spinor field), and F^{μν} (a tensor, which has the same dimension as the field A, the gauge field). Let me recall the standard dimensions:

In 4D spacetime:
- Scalars (like φ in scalar QED) have dimension 1.
- Spinors (ψ) have dimension 3/2.
- The field strength tensor F^{μν} has the same dimension as the gauge field A, which is 1. Because F_{μν} ≈ ∂_μ A_ν - ∂_ν A_μ, so each derivative is dimension 1, and A is dimension 1. So F is also dimension 1.

Now, let's write down the dimensions of each part of the Lagrangian. The Lagrangian is L = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}.

Breaking it down:
ψ̄ is the adjoint spinor, same dimension as ψ, which is 3/2 each. So ψ̄ * ψ would be (3/2) + (3/2) = 3.

σ_{μν} is a product of gamma matrices, but I think it's treated as a dimensionless object because it's a matrix structure, not an operator with derivatives. So it doesn't contribute any mass dimension.

F^{μν} is dimension 1. So putting it all together: the product of the fields is (3) [from ψ̄ ψ] multiplied by (1) [from F], giving 4. So the term without κ is dimension 4.

Since the Lagrangian must have dimension 4, κ must be dimensionless. Wait, wait, no: Wait, the term is κ times that product. So the entire term's dimension is [κ] + 3 + 1 = [κ] + 4. But the Lagrangian has to be dimension 4. So [κ] +4 =4 → [κ] =0. But wait, wait, that can't be right because none of the options have [κ]=-1 and 0 isn't an option either.

Wait, am I making a mistake here? Let me double-check. Wait, the term is ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}.

Let me think again about the dimensions:

ψ is dimension 3/2. So ψ̄ is also 3/2. So ψ̄ σ ψ is (3/2 + 3/2) = 3.

F^{μν} is dimension 1.

So the product is 3 +1 =4. So each term in the Lagrangian must have dimension 4. So the product without κ is dimension 4. So κ must be dimensionless? So [κ] is 0. But none of the options show [κ] =0. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I messed up F^{mu nu}’s dimension. Let me think. The field strength tensor F is ∂μ Aν - ∂ν Aμ. Since ∂ has dimension 1, and A has dimension 1, F is dimension 2? No, wait. Because each term is ∂μ Aν: ∂ is dimension 1, A is dimension 1, so each term is dimension 2. So F is dimension 2? Oh wait, no, because F is the field tensor, which is the derivative of A. Wait, no: Wait, no, the field tensor F is [F] = [∂ A] → each ∂ is 1, each A is 1. So F is 1 +1 =2? Or wait, no, because F is a tensor built from two derivatives acting on A. Wait, no, F_{μν} = ∂_μ A_ν - ∂_ν A_μ. Each A is dimension 1, and each ∂ is dimension 1. So each term is 1 +1 = 2. So F is dimension 2.

Oh! So I was wrong before. F has dimension 2. That changes everything.

So ψ̄ σ ψ is 3, and F is 2. So the product is 3 + 2 =5.

So [L_int] = [κ] +5 =4, since L must be dimension 4. So [κ] =4-5 =-1.

Oh, okay, that makes sense now. So [κ] is -1.

So looking at the options: Option A says [κ]=-1, theory renormalizable. Option C says same dimension, but theory not renormalizable.

Now, is the theory renormalizable?

Renormalizability depends on the interaction terms having coupling constants with positive or zero mass dimension. Because, in general, in a term like g φ^n, if [g] is positive (or zero), the theory is renormalizable. Because higher dimension operators (negative mass dimension) would lead to non-renormalizable theories, since their coupling constants have positive mass dimensions (wait, actually, no. Wait, the opposite: If the coupling has negative dimension, that term is of higher dimension, which would make it non-renormalizable because the interaction is of higher order.)

Wait, the term is dimension 5? Because the Lagrangian is dimension 4, but our term is [L_int] is [g] * [fields], which equals 4. So if [g] is -1, then the interaction term is [g] [ψ]^2 [F] = (-1) +3 +2 =4. So the interaction is of dimension 5? Or wait, the dimension of the term is 4. So the dimension of the coupling is 4 - (sum of field dimensions).

Wait, but in terms of renormalizability, the interaction term's dimension is important. So in 4D, renormalizable theories require that the coupling has a mass dimension ≥ 0. Because the dimension of the coupling [g] = D - (sum of field dimensions). For a term to be renormalizable, [g] must be ≥0.

Wait, no. Wait, renormalizable terms are those where the coupling has non-negative mass dimension. Because operators with negative mass dimension are non-renormalizable, as they would require higher and higher order terms, leading to non-predictive theories.

So in our case, [κ] is -1. So this coupling has negative mass dimension. That means the interaction term is a higher-dimensional operator. Such terms are non-renormalizable because you can't absorb the infinities with a finite number of counterterms.

Wait, but wait. Let's think about the term in the Lagrangian. The term is dimension 4 because it's in the Lagrangian. So the dimension of the term [L] is 4. The term is [κ][ψ]^2 [F] = [κ] + 3 + 2 = [κ]+5 =4. So [κ] = -1.

So the coupling has dimension -1, which is negative. That implies that the term is of higher dimension. Therefore, the interaction is non-renormalizable.

So the theory is not renormalizable. So which option is that? Option C says [κ]=-1 and not renormalizable. Option D says [κ]=1 and not renormalizable.

Wait, but wait. Are we sure about the operator's dimension? Because another way to think about it is looking at the dimension of the interaction term. The interaction is L = κ ψ̄ σ F ψ.

In 4D, for a term to be renormalizable, the dimension of the coupling must satisfy [g] ≥ 0. Because each spacetime integral in the Feynman diagrams brings in factors of momentum (which has dimension 1), and if the coupling is negative, higher loop corrections would require higher powers of momentum, making the theory non-renormalizable.

So since [κ] is -1, which is negative, the theory is not renormalizable.

So the options are:

A) [k] =-1, renormalizable → No, because [k] is negative, not renormalizable.

B) [k]=1, renormalizable → [k] would be 1, which would be positive, so renormalizable. But our calculation shows [k]=-1.

C) [k]=-1, not renormalizable → Yes, this fits.

D) [k]=1, not renormalizable → No because if [k] is 1, the theory would be renormalizable.

So the correct answer should be C.

To determine the mass dimension of the coupling constant \( \kappa \) and whether the theory is renormalizable, we analyze the given Lagrangian:

\[
\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}} = \kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu},
\]
where \( \sigma_{\mu\nu} = \frac{i}{2} \left[ \gamma_\mu, \gamma_\nu \right] \) and \( F^{\mu\nu} \) is the field strength tensor.

### Step 1: Mass dimensions of the fields
In four-dimensional spacetime, the mass dimensions of the fields are:
- Spinor field \( \psi \): \( [\psi]_M = \frac{3}{2} \),
- Adjoint spinor \( \bar{\psi} \): \( [\bar{\psi}]_M = \frac{3}{2} \),
- Field strength tensor \( F^{\mu\nu} \): \( [F^{\mu\nu}]_M = 2 \).

### Step 2: Mass dimension of the coupling constant \( \kappa \)
The Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4 in four spacetime dimensions. Breaking down the dimensions of the interaction term:
- \( \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi \): The spinor fields contribute \( \frac{3}{2} + \frac{3}{2} = 3 \), and \( \sigma_{\mu\nu} \) is dimensionless. Thus, \( [\bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi]_M = 3 \).
- \( F^{\mu\nu} \): \( [F^{\mu\nu}]_M = 2 \).

The total dimension of the term \( \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu} \) is \( 3 + 2 = 5 \). Since the Lagrangian must have dimension 4, the coupling constant \( \kappa \) must satisfy:
\[
[\kappa]_M + 5 = 4 \implies [\kappa]_M = -1.
\]

### Step 3: Renormalizability of the theory
A theory is renormalizable if the coupling constants have non-negative mass dimensions (\( [g]_M \geq 0 \)). In this case, \( [\kappa]_M = -1 \), which is negative. This indicates that the interaction term is a higher-dimensional operator, making the theory non-renormalizable.

### Step 4: Evaluating the options
- **Option A**: \( [\kappa]_M = -1 \), theory is renormalizable. **Incorrect**, as the theory is not renormalizable.
- **Option B**: \( [\kappa]_M = 1 \), theory is renormalizable. **Incorrect**, as \( [\kappa]_M = -1 \), not 1.
- **Option C**: \( [\kappa]_M = -1 \), theory is not renormalizable. **Correct**, as derived above.
- **Option D**: \( [\kappa]_M = 1 \), theory is not renormalizable. **Incorrect**, as \( [\kappa]_M = -1 \), not 1.

### Final Answer:
The mass dimension of \( \kappa \) is \( [\kappa]_M = -1 \), and the theory is not renormalizable.
