Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonances and their decay distances. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the problem says.

The question is asking about the mean decay distance of a meson X. They provided the production energy EX, which is 8 GeV. The mass mX is 1.2 GeV, and the width ΓX is 320 MeV. The options are A to D, all in terms of 10^-15 or 10^-16 meters. 

Wait, I remember that the decay length depends on the lifetime of the particle and its velocity. The formula I think is something like L = v * τ, where τ is the mean lifetime. But how do I find τ?

Oh right, the mean lifetime τ is related to the width Γ by the uncertainty principle. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle tells us that ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2. For a particle, the width Γ is the uncertainty in energy, so τ ≈ ħ/(Γ c^2). Wait, no, more accurately, the mean lifetime τ is ħ divided by the total decay width Γ. So τ = ħ / Γ.

But wait, Γ is given in MeV, and ħ is in units with energy. Need to convert units properly. Oh right, ħc is a common unit in particle physics. Let me recall: ħc is approximately 197.33 MeV fm, where fm is femtometers (10^-15 m). So I can use that.

So first, I'll compute the mean lifetime τ. Since Γ is in MeV, I can write τ = ħc / (Γ c^2) ? Wait, no, maybe I should think about it differently. Alternatively, the formula for decay length is L = (cτ) * βγ, where β is v/c and γ is the Lorentz factor. Because the lifetime observed is the proper time multiplied by γ.

Wait, hold on. The mean lifetime τ is the proper time, so when considering the lab frame, we have to multiply by γ. But wait, does τ include the γ factor already? Or is τ the proper time? Hmm, I think τ is the proper lifetime, so in the lab frame, the observed lifetime is τ_lab = γ τ. So the decay length is L = v * τ_lab = v γ τ.

But wait, another approach: the mean decay length is given by L = (c * τ) * (p)/(E), where p is the momentum and E is the energy. Because the velocity v = (pc^2)/E, but that might complicate things. Alternatively, maybe the formula is L = (c * τ) * βγ, where β = v/c and γ is the Lorentz factor.

Wait, perhaps a better way is to compute the meson's lifetime as seen in the lab frame, then multiply by its velocity to get the decay length.

So steps:

1. Calculate the mean proper lifetime τ = ħ / Γ.
2. Compute the Lorentz factor γ = E/(m c^2).
3. The observed lifetime τ' = γ τ.
4. The velocity v = sqrt(1 - (1/γ²)) c.
5. Decay length L = v * τ'.

Wait, but let me see. The meson is moving with some velocity, so the lifetime we observe is longer due to time dilation. So yes, L = v * τ', where τ' = γ τ.

Alternatively, another formula I've heard is L = (c * τ) * (p)/(m c), which comes from v = p/(γ m) and τ' = γ τ. So L = (p/(γ m)) * (γ τ) ) = (p τ) / (m). Hmm, but I think I'll stick with the first approach because units might be tricky.

Wait, let me get the steps right.

First, compute τ = ħ / Γ.

But Γ is given in MeV. ħ has units of MeV·fm (since ħc ≈ 197 MeV fm), but wait, ħ is in units of energy multiplied by time. So to compute τ (time), using τ = ħ / Γ.

So Γ is in MeV, so τ in seconds would require converting ħ into units of MeV·s. Let me see, since ħc ≈ 197.33 MeV fm, and 1 fm = 1e-15 m. Wait, but perhaps it's easier to use the formula involving ħc.

Wait, another way to compute τ is using the relation τ = ħc / (Γ c^2) ) * (something). Hmm, perhaps I should think in terms of natural units where c=1, but maybe it's getting complicated.

Alternatively, let me recall that the width Γ is related to the lifetime by Γ = ħ / τ. So τ = ħ / Γ.

But units are tricky. Let's compute ħ in units of MeV·s. 

I know that ħ ≈ 6.582×10^-25 GeV·s. Since 1 GeV is 1e3 MeV, so ħ ≈ 6.582e-25 * 1e3 MeV·s = 6.582e-22 MeV·s.

So τ = ħ / Γ = (6.582e-22 MeV·s) / (320 MeV) ) = (6.582e-22 / 320) s.

Calculating that: 6.582e-22 /320 ≈ 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Wait, but wait, I think I messed up the units for ħ. Let me double-check. Oh wait, no, I think the correct value is ħ ≈ 6.582×10^-25 GeV·s. Since 1 GeV is 1e9 eV, but in terms of MeV, 1 GeV is 1e3 MeV. So 6.582e-25 GeV·s = 6.582e-25 * 1e3 MeV·s = 6.582e-22 MeV·s. So that part was correct.

So τ = 6.582e-22 MeV·s / 320 MeV = (6.582e-22 / 320) s ≈ 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Now, compute the Lorentz factor γ. The energy EX is 8 GeV. The mass mX is 1.2 GeV. So in units where c=1, E^2 = p^2 + m^2.

So E = 8 GeV, m = 1.2 GeV. So p^2 = E^2 - m^2 = 64 - 1.44 = 62.56 (GeV)^2.

So p = sqrt(62.56) ≈ 7.91 GeV.

Then, γ = E / m = 8 / 1.2 ≈ 6.6667.

So γ is about 6.6667.

Then, the observed lifetime τ_lab = γ τ = 6.6667 * 2.056875e-24 s ≈ 1.37125e-23 seconds.

Now, the velocity v: since γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - β^2), we can find β. Let's compute β:

γ = 1/sqrt(1 - β^2) → 1/γ^2 = 1 - β^2 → β^2 = 1 - 1/(γ^2).

So β = sqrt(1 - (1/(6.6667)^2 )).

Calculating 1/(6.6667)^2: 6.6667 is 20/3, so (20/3)^2 = 400/9 ≈44.444. So 1/44.444 ≈ 0.0225.

So 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. So β = sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887.

So the velocity v is approximately 0.9887c, where c is the speed of light ≈3e8 m/s.

Now, the decay length L is v * τ_lab.

So L = 0.9887c * τ_lab.

Compute that:

0.9887 * 3e8 m/s = approx 2.966e8 m/s.

τ_lab is 1.37125e-23 s.

So L = 2.966e8 m/s * 1.37125e-23 s = (2.966 * 1.37125) * 1e-15 m.

Let me compute 2.966 * 1.37125.

2.966 * 1 = 2.966; 2.966 * 0.37125 ≈ 2.966 * 0.37 ≈ 1.097. So total approx 4.063.

So L ≈ 4.063e-15 meters.

Looking at the options:

A) 5.0223e-16
B)4.0655e-15
C)5.0223e-15
D)4.0655e-16

So the closest is option B, 4.0655e-15 m.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations because I approximated β as 0.9887. Let me compute more accurately.

Compute β:

γ = 6.6667.

gamma squared is (20/3)^2 = 400/9 ≈44.444444.

So 1/(gamma^2) = 9/400 = 0.0225.

So 1 - 1/(gamma^2) = 0.9775. So sqrt(0.9775) is sqrt(0.9775).

Let me compute that more accurately. 0.9775 is close to 0.98's square is 0.9604, 0.99^2 is 0.9801. So 0.9775 is between 0.99² and 0.98². So let me compute sqrt(0.9775).

Using linear approximation. Let x=0.9775.

Let me compute using the Newton-Raphson method.

Let me start with f(x)=x² -0.9775=0.

x0=0.99 → x0²=0.9801. f=0.9801 -0.9775=0.0026.

f'(x0)=2x0=1.98.

x1 = x0 - f(x0)/f'(x0) = 0.99 - 0.0026/(1.98) ≈ 0.99 - 0.001313 = 0.988687.

Compute x1 squared: (0.988687)^2 = approx 0.977501, which is very close to 0.9775.

So β ≈0.988687.

So v ≈0.988687 c.

So more accurately, v ≈0.988687 *3e8 m/s ≈2.966e8 m/s.

So now, τ_lab = gamma * tau =6.6667 * 2.056875e-24 s.

6.6667 * 2.056875e-24 = let's compute 6 *2.056875e-24=12.341e-24; 0.6667 *2.056875e-24≈1.371e-24. So total τ_lab≈13.711e-24 s =1.3711e-23 s.

Wait, earlier I had 1.37125e-23, so same ballpark.

L= v * tau_lab = 2.966e8 m/s * 1.3711e-23 s.

Multiply 2.966e8 * 1.3711e-23 = 2.966 *1.3711 * 1e-15.

Compute 2.966 *1.3711.

Let me compute 2.966 *1.3711.

Hmm, 2.966 *1.3 is 3.8558. 2.966 *0.0711 is approx 0.2108. So total approx 3.8558 +0.2108=4.0666.

So L ≈4.0666e-15 m.

Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m. So that's very close.

So the correct answer should be option B.

To determine the mean decay distance of the meson resonance \( X \), we use the relationship \( L = v \tau_{\text{lab}} \), where \( \tau_{\text{lab}} \) is the observed lifetime in the lab frame and \( v \) is the velocity of the meson. The steps are as follows:

1. **Calculate the proper lifetime \( \tau \):**  
   The proper lifetime is given by \( \tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma} \), where \( \Gamma \) is the decay width. Using \( \hbar \approx 6.582 \times 10^{-22} \, \text{MeV·s} \) and \( \Gamma = 320 \, \text{MeV} \),  
   \[
   \tau = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-22}}{320} \approx 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}.
   \]

2. **Compute the Lorentz factor \( \gamma \):**  
   The Lorentz factor is \( \gamma = \frac{E}{m} \), where \( E = 8 \, \text{GeV} \) and \( m = 1.2 \, \text{GeV} \).  
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{8}{1.2} \approx 6.6667.
   \]

3. **Calculate the observed lifetime \( \tau_{\text{lab}} \):**  
   The observed lifetime is \( \tau_{\text{lab}} = \gamma \tau \).  
   \[
   \tau_{\text{lab}} = 6.6667 \times 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \approx 1.37125 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{s}.
   \]

4. **Determine the velocity \( v \):**  
   Using \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \beta^2}} \), we find \( \beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}} \).  
   \[
   \beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{(6.6667)^2}} \approx \sqrt{0.9775} \approx 0.9887.
   \]  
   Thus, \( v \approx 0.9887c \), where \( c \approx 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \).  
   \[
   v \approx 0.9887 \times 3 \times 10^8 \approx 2.966 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}.
   \]

5. **Compute the decay length \( L \):**  
   The decay length is \( L = v \tau_{\text{lab}} \).  
   \[
   L = (2.966 \times 10^8) \times (1.37125 \times 10^{-23}) \approx 4.066 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}.
   \]

6. **Compare with the options:**  
   The closest value to \( L \approx 4.066 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \) is option **B**, \( 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \).
