Okay, I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem about the intrinsic angular momentum of a muon. Hmm, the question is about finding the correct statement regarding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator Ay.

So, the setup is that Ay is equal to c multiplied by the matrix S. Wait, c is h divided by 4π, right? And S is a 2x2 matrix. The first row is 0 and -i, and the second row is i and 0. Oh wait, I think I remember that the Pauli matrices have a similar structure. So S might be one of them.

Wait, Pauli matrices are σx, σy, σz. Let me think. The σy matrix is [ [0, -i], [i, 0] ]? Or is it another one? Oh wait, no, wait. Let me recall: σx is [[0,1],[1,0]], σy is [[0,-i],[i,0]], and σz is [[1,0],[0,-1]]. Oh right, so S here must be σy, because the structure matches.

So S is the Pauli y-matrix. Then, Ay = c * S. Since c is h/(4π), that would make Ay = (h/(4π)) * σy.

Wait, but what's the operator for angular momentum? Oh right, the spin angular momentum operator S is (ħ/2) times the Pauli matrices. Because ħ is h/(2π). So for example, S^y would be (ħ/2) σy, which is (h/(4π)) σy. So actually, in this case, Ay is S^y? Because Ay is c (h/(4π)) multiplied by S (σy), which equals (h/(4π)) * σy. Which is exactly the same as S^y, since S^y = ħ/2 σy = (h/(4π)) σy. So yes, Ay is the y-component of the spin operator.

Now the question is to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. So I need to find the eigenvalues of Ay.

The eigenvalues of a matrix are found by solving det(Ay - aI) = 0. So let's write down Ay. Since Ay = c * S, and S is σy, which is [[0, -i], [i, 0]], then:

Ay = c * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]

Compute the eigenvalues. The eigenvalues of a 2x2 matrix can be found via the characteristic equation: a^2 - tr(Ay) a + det(Ay) = 0.

But wait, for a Pauli matrix, the eigenvalues are ±ħ/2 for each component. Wait, because S^y has eigenvalues ±ħ/2. But if Ay is equal to S^y, then its eigenvalues would be ±ħ/2.

Wait, but let's think again. Let me compute the eigenvalues of Ay.

Ay = (h/(4π)) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]

So the matrix elements are:

A11 = 0
A12 = -i * c = -i (h/(4π))
A21 = i * c = i (h/(4π))
A22 = 0

The trace is zero because the diagonal elements are zero. So the trace Tr(Ay) = 0.

The determinant is (A11 A22 - A12 A21) = (0 * 0) - [ (-i c)(i c) ) ].

Calculating that: [ (-i c)(i c) ] = (-i * i) c². Since i * (-i) is -i² = -(-1) = 1. Wait, wait, let me compute it again.

(-i c)(i c) = (-i * i) * c². i * (-i) = -(i²) = -(-1) = 1. So (-i)(i) = 1. So this term is (1) * c². So det(Ay) = 0 - (1 * c²) = -c².

So the characteristic equation is a² - 0*a + (-c²) = 0 → a² = c² → a = ±c. So the eigenvalues are ±c. Since c = h/(4π), then the eigenvalues are ± h/(4π).

Wait, but wait, that contradicts what I thought earlier. Or does it? Because S^y has eigenvalues ± ħ/2, and ħ is h/(2π). So ħ/2 = h/(4π). Which matches the eigenvalues we just found. So yes, the eigenvalues are ± h/(4π).

Looking at the options:

Option A: The imaginary part of the eigenvalue are ±2πh or –2πh, and real parts are ±h/(4π). Hmm, but the eigenvalues are real numbers because the Pauli matrices are Hermitian. So the eigenvalues should be real. So this option is wrong because it's talking about imaginary parts, which shouldn't be there.

Option B: Imaginary parts are ±1/2, real parts ±1. Also suggests eigenvalues have both real and imaginary parts, which isn't the case here. So B is incorrect.

Wait, but wait, maybe I made a mistake. Are the eigenvalues real? Because Ay is Hermitian. Because S is Hermitian, and c is real, so Ay is also Hermitian. So the eigenvalues must be real. So any option implying eigenvalues with imaginary parts is wrong. So options A and B can be eliminated.

Options C and D: Let's look at them.

Option C: The eigenfunction of Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A², but not of Az.

I remember that in quantum mechanics, if an operator shares eigenfunctions with another operator, they might commute. Also, A² is the square of the spin component, which commutes with all components since it's a Casimir operator. Wait, but let me think.

Wait, the square of the spin operator is S^2 = (Sx)^2 + (Sy)^2 + (Sz)^2. Which is a scalar, so it commutes with any component. So the eigenvalues of S² are the same for all directions. So if φ is an eigenfunction of Sy (Ay), then it's also an eigenfunction of S² (A²?), since S² commutes with Sy. So option C says eigenfunctions of Ay are also eigenfunctions of A², which is correct. But what about Az?

Well, whether it's also an eigenfunction of Az would depend. The eigenfunctions of Sy and Sz are different, except in certain cases. So an eigenfunction of Sy is not an eigenfunction of Sz. So option C is correct in that the eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above. Hmm, the basis functions of the operator? Well, the eigenvectors of a matrix form a basis for the vector space if the matrix is diagonalizable. Since Ay is a 2x2 matrix and its eigenvalues are distinct (±c), it is diagonalizable. So the eigenvectors form a basis. So D says that the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. I think that's correct. But wait, the basis functions probably refer to the eigenvectors as a basis for the space. So D's statement seems correct as well.

Wait, but let me re-read option D: The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above. Hmm, I'm not exactly sure what that means. Maybe it's saying that the matrix is expressed in the basis of its eigenfunctions. Since Ay is a 2x2 matrix, and it's diagonal in its eigenbasis, the matrix would be diagonal when expressed in those eigenfunctions. So the statement in D is correct. But I'm not sure if that's the correct interpretation.

Wait, but the problem is to choose the correct statement. Let's go back to the options.

Option C says eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. That seems correct because A² commutes with Ay, so they share eigenfunctions. But Az doesn't commute with Ay, so their eigenfunctions are different. So C is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of Ay. Hmm, perhaps this is correct because in the eigenbasis, the matrix is diagonal, so the basis is made up of the eigenvectors. So D is correct.

Wait, but let me think again. So, if a matrix is diagonalizable, its eigenvectors form a basis. So the statement in D is correct. So is option D correct?

But let me think about the wording. The 'basis functions of the matrix operator Ay'—perhaps it's referring to the matrix being expressed in the standard basis, which isn't necessarily the case. But in any case, the eigenfunctions do form a basis. So D might be correct.

Wait, but which option is correct according to the question. The question is which statement is correct during the calculation.

Let me think about each option.

Option C: The eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az.

This is correct because A² commutes with Ay, so they share eigenfunctions. But Az doesn't commute with Ay, so their eigenfunctions are different. So C is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the operator Ay. Since the operator is 2x2 and has two eigenvectors which are orthogonal and form a basis, D is correct.

Wait, but both C and D could be correct statements. But let me look at the options again. The question says which statement is correct during the calculation. So which of these is correct.

Wait, let's think about the matrix representation. The matrix S is in the standard basis. The eigenfunctions of Ay are the eigenvectors which form a different basis. So the basis functions (eigenfunctions) are indeed the basis for the operator, but not necessarily the standard basis.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let's try to think again. 

We have eigenvalues ±c, which are ±h/(4π). As for the eigenfunctions, they're eigenvectors of Ay. So, any statement about the nature of the eigenfunctions.

Option C says that the eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A². Since A² is the square of the spin operator, which is S^2 = (ħ/2)^2 I, because for a spin-½ particle, S² is ( (1/2)(1/2 +1) ) ħ² I = (3/4) ħ² I. Wait, no, no. Wait, S² is Sx² + Sy² + Sz². For a spin-½ particle, S² = ( (1/2)(1/2 +1) ) ħ^2 I = (3/4) ħ^2 I. So it's a scalar multiple of the identity matrix. So if a function is an eigenfunction of S², then any vector is an eigenfunction because it's just scaled by a constant. So every eigenvector of Sy (Ay) is also an eigenvector of S² because S² is identity. So the statement in option C is correct because the eigenfunctions of Ay are also eigenfunctions of A². And they are not eigenfunctions of Az because Sy and Sz don't commute.

So option C is correct.

Option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. I'm not entirely sure. The matrix operator is represented in the standard basis, but the eigenfunctions form a different basis. So D's statement might be correct, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the statement is suggesting that the eigenfunctions form a basis for Ay's representation, which is true because any 2x2 matrix can be diagonalized if it has two distinct eigenvalues, which Ay does (since eigenvalues are ±c, which are distinct if c ≠0). So D could be correct.

Wait, but looking at the options, only one can be correct. Let me think again.

Looking at the options again:

Option C: The eigenfunction of Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A^2, but not of Az.

Since A² is S^2, which is a multiple of identity, every function is an eigenfunction. So any eigenfunction of Ay is automatically an eigenfunction of A². So C's statement is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. I think this is correct because the matrix in the eigenbasis is diagonal, but the statement isn't entirely clear. It's a bit ambiguous.

Wait, but the question is about which statement is correct. So perhaps options C and D are both correct. But this is a multiple-choice question, so only one option is correct.

Wait, let me look for the correct calculation steps.

We found that the eigenvalues are ± h/(4π), which are real. So options A and B are wrong because they have imaginary parts.

So the correct options are among C and D.

But let's think about the statements more carefully.

Option C: The eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az.

Yes, because A² is a scalar, so any function is an eigenfunction. So this is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.

The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the space, but the matrix representation in that basis would be diagonal. So yes, the eigenfunctions form a basis for the operator. So D is correct.

Wait, but the question is which statement is correct during the calculation. So both C and D could be correct, but perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, let me read the question again. It says, during the calculation, which statement will you consider to be correct.

So perhaps when you calculate the eigenvalues and eigenvectors, you can make certain statements about them.

Option C is about whether the eigenfunctions are eigenfunctions of another operator. Option D is about the basis.

If you're calculating the eigenvectors, you would find that they form a basis for the space. So D is correct. But so is C.

Wait, but the options are exclusive. Let me think about the options again.

Option C: eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az.

Since A² is S², which is ( (ħ/2)^2 ) I, so any state is an eigenstate. So any eigenfunction of Ay is an eigenfunction of A². So C is correct.

So in the calculation, we would conclude that the eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. So option C is correct.

So the correct answer is option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we analyze the operator \( A_y \), which is given as \( A_y = c \cdot S \), where \( c = \frac{h}{4\pi} \) and \( S \) is the Pauli \( y \)-matrix:

\[
S = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Thus, \( A_y \) can be written as:

\[
A_y = \frac{h}{4\pi} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 1: Eigenvalues of \( A_y \)
The eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are found by solving the characteristic equation:

\[
\det(A_y - aI) = 0.
\]

Substituting \( A_y \), the characteristic equation becomes:

\[
a^2 - \text{Tr}(A_y)a + \det(A_y) = 0.
\]

Since \( A_y \) is a \( 2 \times 2 \) matrix with trace \( \text{Tr}(A_y) = 0 \) and determinant \( \det(A_y) = -\left(\frac{h}{4\pi}\right)^2 \), the eigenvalues are:

\[
a = \pm \frac{h}{4\pi}.
\]

Thus, the eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are real and equal to \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \).

### Step 2: Analysis of the Options
#### **Option A**:
This option states that the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues are \( \pm 2\pi h \) and the real parts are \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \). However, the eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are purely real (\( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \)), so this option is incorrect.

#### **Option B**:
This option suggests that the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues are \( \pm \frac{1}{2} \) and the real parts are \( \pm 1 \). Again, the eigenvalues are purely real (\( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \)), so this option is also incorrect.

#### **Option C**:
This option states that the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) can also be eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \) (the square of the angular momentum operator) but not of \( A_z \) (the \( z \)-component of the angular momentum operator). 

- \( A^2 \) is the square of the spin operator, which is a scalar multiple of the identity matrix for a spin-\(\frac{1}{2}\) particle. Since \( A^2 \) commutes with \( A_y \), the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are also eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \).
- \( A_z \), however, does not commute with \( A_y \), so the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are not eigenfunctions of \( A_z \).

Thus, this option is correct.

#### **Option D**:
This option states that the eigenfunctions \( \phi \) of \( A_y \) are the basis functions of the matrix operator \( A_y \). Since \( A_y \) is a \( 2 \times 2 \) matrix with distinct eigenvalues (\( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \)), its eigenfunctions form a basis for the vector space. Therefore, this statement is also correct.

### Step 3: Final Decision
Both options C and D are correct based on the analysis. However, the question asks for the statement that is correct **during the calculation**. Option C directly addresses the relationship between the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) and other operators, making it the most relevant choice during the calculation.
