Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a diatomic molecule and the quantum rotation-vibration model. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

Alright, the question says the molecule is in its fundamental state, which I think is the lowest energy state. They're asking what momentum a photon should have so that when it's absorbed, the molecule moves to the next lowest energy state.

The molecule is made of atoms X and Y. Their masses are 20 amu and 2 amu respectively. The bond length is 2 angstroms, and the angular frequency is 4e14 rad/s.

Wait, so this is about transitioning between energy states. I remember that in the rotation-vibration model, the energy levels have both rotational and vibrational parts. But the question mentions the non-rigid rotor model, but I'm not sure if that affects this part. Maybe it's about the energy transitions.

The fundamental state is the lowest energy state. The next state with the lowest possible energy—that might be the next vibrational state, or maybe a rotation change. But wait, the question is about switching to the next state, which I think could involve a change in both vibration and rotation. Or maybe it's just the first excited state of the system.

Wait, no. The fundamental state is the lowest possible energy, combining both rotation and vibration. The next state with the lowest energy would probably be the next vibrational state because vibrational energy levels are quantized and higher in energy than rotational. Or maybe it's a change in rotation? I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, the problem is about the momentum of the photon. Momentum p is related to energy. Oh, right, photons carry energy E = p*c, where c is the speed of light. So if I can find the energy needed for the transition, I can find the momentum.

So what energy transition are we looking at? The molecule is in the fundamental state, which I think is the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0, maybe). When it absorbs a photon, it transitions to the next possible state. But what's the next state?

In the quantum mechanical model, the energy levels are quantized. For a diatomic molecule, the energy levels are a combination of rotational and vibrational energies. The fundamental state is the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0), I think.

The next possible state could be when the rotational state increases (J=1) or the vibrational state increases (v=1). Which requires less energy? Because the rotational energy levels are E_rot = B * J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant. The vibrational energy levels are E_vib = (1/2) h w + h w v, where v is the vibrational quantum number.

Wait, so the ground state is v=0, J=0. The next state could be either J=1 or v=1. Which one has lower energy?

Let me think about the values. The rotational constant B is given by h/(8 pi^2 I c), where I is the moment of inertia. Alternatively, B = (h)/(8 π² I). Wait, I might have to calculate B.

The moment of inertia I for a diatomic molecule is μ r², where μ is the reduced mass and r is the bond length.

Right, so first I'll calculate μ. The reduced mass μ is (Mx * My)/(Mx + My). Mx is 20 amu, My is 2 amu.

So μ = (20*2)/(20+2) = 40/22 ≈ 1.818 amu. Oh wait, but I need to convert this into kg because I'm working in SI units.

1 amu is approximately 1.6605e-27 kg. So μ ≈ 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg. Let me compute that:

1.818 * 1.6605 ≈ 3.017. So 3.017e-27 kg.

Wait, wait. Wait, 20 amu is 20 * 1.6605e-27 kg = 3.321e-26 kg, and 2 amu is 3.321e-27 kg. So when calculating μ:

μ = (20 * 2 amu) / (22 amu) ) → (40 / 22) amu → ≈ 1.818 amu.

But in kg: 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 ≈ 3.017e-27 kg.

Now, I is μ r². The bond length r is 2 angstroms. 1 angstrom is 1e-10 meters, so 2 angstroms is 2e-10 m.

So I = 3.017e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2.

Calculate (2e-10)^2 = 4e-20 m². So I = 3.017e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.2068e-46 kg·m².

Now, rotational constant B is h/(8 π² I). Planck's constant h is 6.626e-34 J·s.

So B = (6.626e-34) / (8 * π² * 1.2068e-46).

Compute denominator: 8 * π² ≈ 8 * 9.8696 ≈ 78.9568.

So denominator = 78.9568 * 1.2068e-46 ≈ 78.9568 * 1.2068e-46.

Let me calculate 78.9568 * 1.2068 ≈ 78.9568 * 1.2 is about 94.75, 78.9568 * 0.0068 is about 0.536. So total ≈ 95.286.

So denominator ≈ 95.286e-46 = 9.5286e-45.

So B ≈ 6.626e-34 / 9.5286e-45.

Compute that:

6.626 / 9.5286 ≈ 0.695.

Exponents: 1e-34 / 1e-45 = 1e11.

So B ≈ 0.695e11 ≈ 6.95e10 s^-1.

Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check the calculations.

Wait, I think I made a mistake in the exponent. Let's re-calculate I.

I = μ * r².

μ is 3.017e-27 kg.

r = 2e-10 m.

r² = (2e-10)^2 = 4e-20 m².

So I = 3.017e-27 kg * 4e-20 m² = 1.2068e-46 kg·m².

Then B = h/(8 π² I) = 6.626e-34 / [8 π² * 1.2068e-46].

Compute denominator: 8 * (π²) ≈ 8 * 9.8696 ≈ 78.9568.

Multiply by I: 78.9568 * 1.2068e-46 ≈ 78.9568 * 1.2068 ≈ 95.286 → 95.286e-46.

So denominator is 95.286e-46 → 9.5286e-45.

So B = 6.626e-34 / 9.5286e-45 = (6.626 /9.5286) * 1e11.

6.626/9.5286 ≈ 0.695. So 0.695e11 → 6.95e10 s^-1.

Wait, that's 6.95e10 rad/s? That seems very high. Because the rotational constant B is typically on the order of 1e11 s^-1 for diatomic molecules. Hmm, maybe it's correct.

Wait, but wait, I thought B is h/(8 π² I), but sometimes it's expressed as B = ħ²/(2I), but maybe I got the formula wrong. Let me think again.

Wait, the rotational energy levels are given by E = B J (J + 1), where B is the rotational constant. B can be calculated as (h²)/(8 π² I c), but I'm getting a bit confused. Alternatively, perhaps the rotational constant in cm^-1 is given by B = h/(8 π² c I), but I might be mixing up the units.

Wait, maybe I should compute B in terms of wavenumbers (cm^-1), which is often the case in spectroscopy. Let me see: the rotational constant B is in cm^-1, and is given by B = h/(8 π² c I), where c is speed of light.

Wait, but maybe my earlier approach was correct for B in terms of s^-1.

Wait, perhaps I should proceed with the given w. The angular frequency w is given as 4e14 rad/s. Hmm, but wait, the bond length is given, so perhaps I should compute the vibrational energy transition.

Wait, the question is about the molecule moving to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So that would be the first excited state, which could involve either a change in vibration or rotation. Which transition has lower energy?

The vibrational energy levels are given by E_vib = (1/2) h w + h w v, where v is the vibrational quantum number. The ground state is v=0, so the first excited state (v=1) would require ΔE = h w.

The rotational energy levels are E_rot = B J (J+1). The ground state is J=0, so the first excited rotational state is J=1, which would require ΔE = B (1*(1+1)) - B (0*(0+1)) ) = 2 B.

So whether the photon causes a vibrational transition or a rotational transition depends on which requires less energy. So if h w is less than 2 B, then the vibrational transition is lower in energy and would be the next state. Otherwise, the rotational.

So I need to compute h w and 2 B to compare.

Given that w is 4e14 rad/s, let's compute h w.

h = 6.626e-34 J·s.

h w = 6.626e-34 * 4e14 = 2.6504e-19 J.

Now, compute 2 B. Earlier, I found B ≈ 6.95e10 s^-1.

So 2 B = 2 * 6.95e10 = 1.39e11 s^-1.

But wait, the units for energy in rotational transition would be E = B (J(J+1)) in Joules. Oh wait, no, B in s^-1 is actually frequency. So E_rot = h B (J(J+1)).

Wait, so the rotational energy for J=0 is E=0, for J=1, E= h B (2) = 2 h B.

So the energy difference between J=0 and J=1 is 2 h B.

So let me compute 2 h B.

h = 6.626e-34 J·s.

B is 6.95e10 s^-1.

So 2 h B = 2 * 6.626e-34 * 6.95e10 = let's compute this.

6.626e-34 * 6.95e10 = (6.626 * 6.95) * 1e-24.

6.626 * 6.95 ≈ approximately 46. (6 *7 is 42, 0.626*7 is ~4.38, 6*0.95=5.7, 0.626*0.95≈0.595 → 42 +4.38 +5.7 +0.595 ≈ 52.675). Wait, maybe I should compute more accurately.

6.626 * 6.95:

6 * 6.95 = 41.7.

0.626 * 6.95 ≈ approx 4.3437.

Total ≈ 41.7 +4.3437 = 46.0437. So 46.0437e-24.

Multiply by 2: 92.087e-24 J → 9.2087e-23 J.

So 2 h B ≈ 9.2e-23 J.

Earlier, h w = 2.65e-19 J.

Wait, h w is much larger than 2 h B. So the rotational transition (J=0→J=1) requires about 9.2e-23 J, while the vibrational transition (v=0→v=1) requires 2.65e-19 J. So the rotational transition requires less energy. Therefore, the molecule will first undergo a rotational transition before a vibrational one.

Wait, but wait. The problem says the molecule is in the fundamental state. The fundamental state is the lowest energy state. So if the molecule is in (v=0, J=0), absorbing a photon that causes a transition to the next state with the lowest energy would be either (v=0, J=1) or (v=1, J=0). Since the rotational transition requires less energy, the photon must have the energy corresponding to the rotational transition.

So the energy needed is ΔE = 2 h B.

Wait, but earlier I found that 2 h B ≈ 9.2e-23 J. The photon's energy would be E_photon = ΔE.

So E_photon = 2 h B = 2 * 6.626e-34 J·s * 6.95e10 s^-1.

Wait, maybe I should compute this again.

Wait, wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. B is in s^-1, so h B is in J.

So B = 6.95e10 s^-1.

h B = 6.626e-34 * 6.95e10 = 6.626e-34 * 6.95e10.

6.626 *6.95 ≈ 46.04.

So 46.04e-24 = 4.604e-23 J.

So 2 h B = 9.208e-23 J.

So the photon's energy is 9.208e-23 J.

But wait, the problem states that the molecule is modeled using the non-rigid rotor model. I'm not entirely sure how that affects things, but maybe it doesn't change the fundamental calculation here.

So the momentum p of the photon. Since E = p c, where c is speed of light, p = E/(c).

c is approximately 3e8 m/s.

So p = (9.208e-23 J ) / (3e8 m/s) → 3.07e-31 kg·m/s.

Wait, but that's not matching any of the options. The options are in the 1e-27 to 1e-28 range.

Hmm, this suggests I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I got the model wrong. The problem says the quantum rotation-vibration model, but perhaps the first transition isn't a pure rotational or vibrational one. Maybe the molecule absorbs a photon that excites both a rotation and vibration change. But that seems more complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the question refers to the transition from the ground state to the first excited state, which is the next energy level, regardless of whether it's rotation or vibration.

Wait, but according to my earlier calculation, the rotational transition requires less energy than the vibrational one. So it should be the rotational transition.

But the options don't match the value I get. Hmm.

Let me check my calculation of B again. Maybe I made a mistake there.

I think I confused the formula for B. Let me re-express:

The rotational constant B is given by:

B = (h) / (8 π² I)

But wait, I think B is sometimes given in terms of wavenumbers (cm^-1), which is B = h/(8 π² c I), where c is the speed of light. Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Wait, wait, let's compute B in terms of energy.

The rotational energy levels are E_rot = (ħ²)/(2I) * J (J +1 ), where ħ is h/(2π). So E_rot = (h²/(8 π² I)) * J (J +1 ). So the rotational constant in terms of energy per J is (h²)/(8 π² I). So for J=0 to J=1, the energy is (h²)/(8 π² I) * 2.

So perhaps B is h²/(8 π² I), which would give E_rot in J. So maybe I confused B's units.

Alternatively, perhaps the rotational constant in terms of frequency is B = (h)/(8 π² I), which is what I computed earlier as 6.95e10 s^-1.

Wait, but when I compute ΔE for rotational transition, I should use E = B * J (J+1) * h.

Wait no, because B is in s^-1, then E is h * B * J (J+1).

So for J=0 to J=1, ΔE = 2 h B.

Wait, but let's recalculate the value of B.

I think the moment of inertia I is correct.

I = μ r² = (3.017e-27 kg) * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.017e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.2068e-46 kg m².

Then B = h/(8 π² I) = 6.626e-34 / (8 * π² * 1.2068e-46).

Compute denominator: 8 * π² ≈ 78.9568.

Multiply by I: 78.9568 * 1.2068e-46 = 95.286e-46 = 9.5286e-45.

So B = 6.626e-34 / 9.5286e-45 = approx 6.95e10 s^-1.

So that's correct.

So 2 h B = 2 * 6.626e-34 *6.95e10.

Wait, 6.626e-34 * 6.95e10 = (6.626 *6.95) e(-34+10) → approx 46.04e-24 → 4.604e-23 J.

Multiply by 2 → 9.208e-23 J.

So E_photon = 9.2e-23 J.

Now, find p = E/c = 9.2e-23 / 3e8 = 3.07e-31 kg·m/s.

Looking at the options, none of the options are in that range. The options are 1e-27 to 1e-28.

Hmm. So I must have made a mistake in my approach.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the vibrational transition. If h w is the energy required, then E = h w = 6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.65e-19 J.

So p = E/c = 2.65e-19 /3e8 ≈ 8.83e-28 kg·m/s.

Which is approximately 8.8e-28 N·s. The options don't have this exactly, but option D is 1.4e-28, option A is 1.9e-28, option C is 1.1e-27, option B is 2.3e-27.

Wait, 8.8e-28 is close to option A (1.9e-28) but not exactly. Hmm.

Wait, did I make a mistake in considering whether the next state is rotational or vibrational?

Earlier, I thought the rotational transition requires less energy than the vibrational one. But according to this, the vibrational transition energy is 2.65e-19 J, which is much larger than the rotational 9.2e-23 J. So the rotational transition is lower in energy. So why is the photon's energy 9.2e-23 J? But none of the options are near that.

Hmm, perhaps the question is about the next state in terms of the overall energy, which is a combination of rotation and vibration. But that complicates things, because the energy levels are a combination. But I'm not familiar with the exact structure of the rotation-vibration levels.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the transition from the ground state (v=0, J=0) to the first excited vibrational state (v=1, J=0). Because that would require energy h w.

But wait, according to my earlier calculation, that's 2.65e-19 J, which gives p ≈ 8.83e-28 kg m/s. But none of the options match this. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of B. Or perhaps the question is about the Raman transition, which involves changes in rotation and vibration, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the minimum energy photon would cause the molecule to transition to the next state, which could be either a vibrational or rotational state. Since the rotational transition requires less energy, the photon needed would be for the rotational transition.

But according to my calculation, the energy is 9.2e-23 J, which leads to p ~3e-31 kg m/s, which isn't an option. So perhaps I did something wrong.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the vibrational transition because the question is about the next state in the model, which includes both rotation and vibration.

Wait, the question says: the molecule is in its fundamental state, which is the ground state of vibration (v=0) and ground state of rotation (J=0). The next state with the lowest possible energy would be the first excited state, which could be either v=1, J=0 or v=0, J=1. Which one has lower energy?

We found that the rotational transition requires less energy. So the photon should have energy for that.

But the options don't match that. Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the transition to the next energy level, considering both rotation and vibration.

Wait, perhaps the next state is a combination, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the rotational constant B. Let me recalculate it more accurately.

I = μ r² → μ is 1.818 amu → 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg = let's compute that.

1.818 * 1.6605 → 1.8 *1.66 is about 2.988. 0.018 * 1.66 is ≈ 0.02988. So total ≈ 3.01788e-27 kg.

r is 2e-10 m. So r² is 4e-20 m².

I = 3.01788e-27 kg * 4e-20 m² = 1.20715e-46 kg m².

Now, B = h/(8 π² I) → h =6.62607e-34 J·s.

Denominator: 8 π² I → 8 * (π^2) * 1.20715e-46.

Compute 8 * π²= 8 *9.8696 ≈78.9568.

Multiply by I: 78.9568 * 1.20715e-46 = let's compute 78.9568 *1.20715 ≈ 95.286 → 95.286e-46 = 9.5286e-45.

So B =6.62607e-34 /9.5286e-45 = (6.62607 /9.5286) *1e11.

6.62607 /9.5286 ≈0.695 → 0.695e11 → 6.95e10 s^-1.

So E_rot = h B (J=0→J=1) → E = 2 h B = 2 *6.626e-34 *6.95e10.

Let me compute 6.626e-34 *6.95e10= (6.626 *6.95) *1e-24.

6.626 *6.95: 6*6=36, 6*.95=5.7 → 36+5.7=41.7, 0.626*6=3.756, 0.626*.95≈0.5947 → total 41.7 +3.756=45.456 +0.5947=46.0507 → so 46.0507e-24 →4.60507e-23 J.

Multiply by 2 →9.210e-23 J.

E_photon =9.21e-23 J → p = E_photon /c =9.21e-23 /3e8 =3.07e-31 kg·m/s.

But none of the options match this. So this suggests that perhaps I'm approaching this incorrectly.

Alternative approach: maybe the transition is a combination of rotational and vibrational changes, but that complicates things beyond my current knowledge.

Wait, perhaps the question is referring to the Raman transition, where the molecule undergoes a change in both vibrational and rotational states, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the transition from the ground state to the first excited vibrational state, which would require energy h w. Let me compute that.

h =6.626e-34 J·s, w=4e14 rad/s.

E_photon = h w =6.626e-34 *4e14 =2.6504e-19 J.

p = E/c =2.6504e-19 /3e8 =8.8347e-28 kg·m/s → approximately 8.8e-28 N·s.

Looking at the options, option A is 1.9e-28, option D is1.4e-28, option C is 1.1e-27.

Hmm, 8.8e-28 isn't directly an option, but option A is 1.9e-28. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me re-calculate.

Wait, 6.626e-34 *4e14 = (6.626 *4) e(-34 +14) → 26.504e-20 → 2.6504e-19 J.

Then p = 2.6504e-19 /3e8 = (2.6504 /3 )e-27 → approximately 0.883e-27 → 8.83e-28 kg m/s.

So the momentum is approximately 8.83e-28 N·s. None of the options match exactly, but option A is 1.9e-28. Hmm, but that's about a factor of 4.5 difference.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the original assumption about whether the next state is a rotational or vibrational change. If the next state is the first vibrational state, then the photon's energy is h w. But according to my earlier calculation, the rotational transition requires much less energy. So perhaps the correct approach is to consider the rotational transition, but that gives a momentum that's not in the options.

Wait, maybe I'm supposed to compute the vibrational transition, not the rotational. But why?

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the fundamental state as the next state after the ground state in a different model.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about the transition between rigid rotor and vibration, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the reduced mass in a different way. Let me recompute the reduced mass.

Mx=20 amu, My=2 amu.

μ = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2 ) =40/22 =1.81818 amu.

Yes, that's correct.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is about the transition from the (v=0, J=0) to (v=1, J=0) state, which requires h w energy, but the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the energy as h w, and compute the momentum. Then see which option is closest.

E_photon = h w =2.65e-19 J.

p= E/c =2.65e-19 /3e8 ≈8.83e-28 kg m/s.

Looking at the options, option A is 1.9e-28. Let me see: 8.8e-28 is about 4.6 times option A. Not quite matching.

But perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the rotational transition's energy. Let me think again.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the question is about the transition to the next state in the rotational model, which would be J=1. But perhaps the calculation of B is wrong because I used the wrong units for the bond length.

Wait, the bond length is given in angstroms. 1 angstrom is 1e-10 meters. So 2 angstroms is 2e-10 m, which I used correctly. So that's right.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the reduced mass in kg correctly.

Wait, 1 amu = 1.6605e-27 kg.

So 20 amu =20 *1.6605e-27 =3.321e-26 kg.

2 amu = 3.321e-27 kg.

μ = (3.321e-26 kg * 3.321e-27 kg) / (3.321e-26 +3.321e-27 ) → wait, no, that's not right. The formula is μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My).

So Mx=3.321e-26 kg, My=3.321e-27 kg.

So μ = (3.321e-26 *3.321e-27 ) / (3.321e-26 +3.321e-27) → numerator is (3.321^2) *1e-53 → approximately 11.026e-53 kg². Denominator is 3.321e-26 (1 + 0.1) )=3.321e-26 *1.1 ≈3.653e-26 kg.

So μ ≈11.026e-53 /3.653e-26 ≈ (11.026 /3.653 )e-27 → approximately 3.017e-27 kg.

Which matches what I calculated earlier. So that's correct.

Hmm. I'm stuck. The options don't match either the rotational or vibrational transitions.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the dissociation energy, but that's not indicated.

Wait, another thought: the question says the molecule is modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, which implies that the energy levels are a combination of both rotational and vibrational energies. So perhaps the next state is a combination where both J and v change. But I'm not sure about the specifics.

Wait, perhaps the next state is the first excited state of vibration, which is v=1, J=0. In that case, the energy is h w.

But according to that, the momentum is 8.8e-28 N·s, which isn't an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the first allowed transition in the Raman spectrum, which would involve a change in J by ±2 and a change in v by ±1. But I'm not sure how that would affect the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the transition from (v=0, J=0) to (v=1, J=1), but that would require even more energy than the vibrational transition.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of B and its corresponding energy.

Wait, perhaps B is not in s^-1 but in cm^-1. Let me try that.

If B is in cm^-1, then the energy would be E = h c B.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me compute B in cm^-1.

B (in cm^-1) = h/(8 π² c I) → h is 6.626e-34 J·s, c is 3e8 m/s.

I =1.2068e-46 kg·m².

So B = 6.626e-34 / (8 * π² * 3e8 * 1.2068e-46).

Compute denominator: 8 * π² ≈78.9568.

78.9568 *3e8 =2.3687e10.

Multiply by I: 2.3687e10 * 1.2068e-46 →2.3687 *1.2068 = approx 2.857 →2.857e-36.

So B =6.626e-34 / 2.857e-36 → (6.626/2.857) * 1e2 →approx 2.32e2 →232 cm^-1.

So E_rot = h c B =6.626e-34 *3e8 *232 ≈6.626e-34 *6.96e10 ≈4.61e-23 J.

Which is the same as before. So E_rot (J=0→J=1) is 4.61e-23 J.

Wait, but even so, the photon's momentum would be 4.61e-23 /3e8 =1.536e-31 kg·m/s. Still not matching any options.

Wait, maybe the question is about the vibrational transition, and I should have E = h (w/2) ?

Wait, no. The vibrational energy levels are E = (1/2) h w + h w v. So the energy for v=0 to v=1 is h w.

Hmm. I'm back to square one.

Another possibility: perhaps the question is using the rigid rotor model, not the non-rigid, but that shouldn't change the approach much.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the vibrational transition, but the answer isn't matching. Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the dissociation energy, but I don't think that's the case.

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in the calculation of B. Let me try computing B in another way.

Another formula for B is B = (h²)/(8 π² I c²), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I should use B = (h)/(8 π² I c).

Wait, no, that would give B in terms of frequency, but perhaps I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, maybe I should compute the moment of inertia in terms of u (reduced mass) and bond length, which I did, but perhaps I should convert the bond length into cm?

No, the moment of inertia is in kg m², which is correct for SI units.

Hmm. I'm stuck. I think the correct approach is to consider the vibrational transition because the options are all in the range of 1e-27 to 1e-28, which is higher than what I calculated for rotation.

But according to that, the momentum would be about 8.8e-28 N·s. The closest option is A) 1.9e-28, which is about a factor of 4.6 less.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the vibrational energy.

Wait, let me re-calculate h w.

h =6.626e-34 J·s.

w =4e14 rad/s.

h w =6.626e-34 *4e14 =2.6504e-19 J. That's correct.

So p = E/c =2.6504e-19 / (3e8) =8.8347e-28 kg·m/s → 8.83e-28 N·s.

Looking at the options, option A is 1.9e-28, which is about half of that. Did I miss a factor of 2 somewhere?

Wait, the question says 'the next state with the lowest possible energy.' Maybe the next state is the first excited rotational state, which is J=1, but I must have made a mistake in calculating that.

Wait, perhaps the energy difference for J=0→J=1 is 2 B h. Let me recompute that.

E = h * B * J (J+1).

So for J=0, E=0. For J=1, E= h B * 2.

So E_photon = 2 h B.

Earlier, I found 2 h B = 9.2e-23 J.

p_photon =9.2e-23 /3e8 =3.07e-31 kg·m/s.

But none of the options are that small.

Wait, the options are much larger. So perhaps I'm missing a factor, or perhaps the model requires a different approach.

Wait, perhaps the question is referring to the transition from the ground state to the first vibrational state (v=1) and the first rotational state (J=1), but that would require adding their energies.

But that would give E = h w + 2 h B.

Which is 2.65e-19 +9.2e-23 J ≈ 2.65e-19 J.

So the photon's momentum would still be about 8.83e-28 N·s.

Hmm, I'm not making progress here. Perhaps I should look at the options and see which value matches the h w calculation.

Wait, option A is 1.9e-28.

Wait, 1.9e-28 is about 2.16 times smaller than 8.8e-28.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of h w. Let me recheck.

h=6.626e-34, w=4e14.

6.626e-34 *4e14 = (6.626 *4) *1e(-34+14) =26.504e-20 =2.6504e-19 J. Correct.

So p =2.65e-19 /3e8 = 8.83e-28.

Wait, perhaps the question is not about the vibrational transition but the rotational. But then why the options don't match.

Another thought: perhaps the question is about the transition from J=0 to J=2, which would have an energy of 6 h B (since E= h B J (J+1) → J=2 is 6 B).

But that would make the energy even larger. 6 h B =6 *6.626e-34 *6.95e10 =approx 2.76e-22 J.

p =2.76e-22 /3e8=9.2e-31 kg·m/s. Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the transition to the next vibrational state, but considering that the vibrational energy is quantized as (v+1/2), so the transition is from v=0 (ground) to v=1 (first excited), requiring h w.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the transition where both vibrational and rotational changes occur, leading to a lower overall energy.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the answer by matching the options to the energy from the rotational transition.

But the options don't match that either.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the reduced mass is calculated incorrectly. Let me recompute that.

Mx=20 amu, My=2 amu.

μ= (20 *2 )/(20+2 )=40/22≈1.818 amu.

In kg: 1.818 *1.6605e-27 = 3.017e-27 kg.

Correct.

Hmm. I'm stuck. I think the correct approach is to consider the vibrational transition, leading to E_photon = h w =2.65e-19 J, p=8.83e-28 kg·m/s. None of the options match exactly, but perhaps the closest is option A) 1.9e-28.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I should re-express the energy in terms of the rotational model.

Wait, perhaps the problem is a combination of rotation and vibration, but I don't know the exact formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the dissociation energy, but that's not the case here.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the question is about the transition from the ground state (v=0, J=0) to the first excited state (v=1, J=0), which would require h w energy. So the momentum is 8.83e-28, but the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that I should calculate the rotational transition's energy, but the options are off by a factor of 1e-4 or something.

But I don't see where that factor would come from.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of B.

Wait, let me think again: I = μ r².

μ=3.017e-27 kg.

r=2e-10 m.

r²=4e-20 m².

I=3.017e-27 *4e-20 =1.2068e-46 kg·m².

Yes.

B = h/(8 π² I)=6.626e-34/(8 * π²*1.2068e-46).

Denominator: 8 * π² ≈78.9568 → 78.9568 *1.2068e-46=95.286e-46=9.5286e-45.

So B=6.626e-34/9.5286e-45=6.95e10 s^-1.

So h B=6.626e-34 *6.95e10=4.604e-23 J.

So 2 h B =9.208e-23 J.

p=9.208e-23 /3e8=3.07e-31 kg·m/s.

But again, this is much smaller than the options.

Hmm. I'm not making progress. I think the correct answer is based on the vibrational transition, leading to p=8.8e-28, but since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is option A) 1.9e-28.

Alternatively, perhaps the w given is actually the vibrational frequency, not the angular frequency. Oh wait, the question says w is the angular frequency, so I used it correctly.

Wait, could the question be using the reduced mass in a wrong way? For example, using Mx * My instead of μ.

Wait, if someone mistakenly uses Mx * My instead of μ, then μ would be (20*2)/(20+2)=1.818 amu, but if someone ignores that and uses 20*2 =40 amu, which is wrong, then I would be (40 amu) * (2e-10 m)^2.

Hmm, let's compute that.

I =40 amu * (2e-10 m)^2.

40 amu =40 *1.6605e-27 kg=6.642e-26 kg.

r=2e-10 m.

r²=4e-20 m².

I=6.642e-26 *4e-20=2.6568e-45 kg·m².

Then B = h/(8 π² I)=6.626e-34/(8 * π² *2.6568e-45).

Denominator:8 * π²≈78.9568 →78.9568 *2.6568e-45≈2.076e-43.

So B=6.626e-34 /2.076e-43=3.19e9 s^-1.

Then E_photon for J=0→1 is 2 h B.

2 h B=2*6.626e-34 *3.19e9=4.18e-24 J.

p =4.18e-24 /3e8=1.39e-32 kg·m/s. Still not matching the options.

Hmm. I think I'm stuck and perhaps need to proceed with the information I have. The only option that's in the same ballpark as the vibrational transition is option A) 1.9e-28. But that's about 4.6 times smaller than the calculated value.

Alternatively, perhaps the calculation is supposed to be done using the vibrational transition, leading to E_photon = (1/2) h w, but that would be for a change in potential energy only. But no, the vibrational energy is quantized as E= (1/2) h w + h w v.

So, the transition from v=0 to v=1 requires h w, not half that.

Wait, perhaps the question is a trick, and the correct answer is the rotational transition, but the options don't match. But since none of the options match, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should re-calculate the rotational energy.

Wait, J=0 to J=1: ΔE= 2 B h.

But B is 6.95e10 s^-1.

So E_photon = 2 *6.626e-34 *6.95e10 =9.21e-23 J.

p =9.21e-23 /3e8 =3.07e-31 kg m/s.

But this is way smaller than the options.

Wait, I'm now thinking that perhaps the question is referring to the vibrational transition, but the given options don't match, so perhaps I should pick the option closest to 8.8e-28, which is option A)1.9e-28.

But I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the reduced mass.

Wait, Mx=20 amu, My=2 amu.

μ = (20 *2 ) / (20+2 )=40/22=1.818 amu.

Wait, but that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the bond length is given in a different unit. Oh wait! The bond length is given in angstroms. Did I convert that correctly into meters?

Yes, 1 angstrom is 1e-10 meters. So 2 angstroms is 2e-10 m. Correct.

Wait, perhaps the bond length is in picometers? No, because 1 angstrom is 100 picometers, so 2 angstroms is 200 pm. But that's the same as 2e-10 m. So no mistake there.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the transition from the ground state to the next state, which is a combination of rotation and vibration. But without knowing the exact energy levels, I can't proceed.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is using the wrong approach, and the correct answer is option C)1.1e-27.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for the vibrational transition, but the answer isn't present. So perhaps the correct answer is option A) 1.9e-28.

But I'm not confident.

After all this, I think the correct approach is to consider the vibrational transition, which would require E = h w =2.65e-19 J, leading to p=8.83e-28. Since this isn't an option, perhaps the intended answer is option A)1.9e-28, but it's unclear. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the rotational transition.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the transition from J=0 to J=2, which would require E=6 h B.

E_photon =6 *6.626e-34 *6.95e10 =2.76e-22 J.

p=2.76e-22 /3e8=9.2e-31 kg m/s. Still not matching.

Hmm.

I think I've exhausted all options. I'll go with the vibrational transition and see that the answer isn't present, but perhaps the intended option is A)1.9e-28.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves a diatomic molecule modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, with atoms X and Y having masses \( M_x = 20 \, \text{amu} \) and \( M_y = 2 \, \text{amu} \), a bond length \( R = 2 \, \text{angstroms} \), and an angular frequency \( \omega = 4 \times 10^{14} \, \text{rad/s} \). The molecule is in its fundamental state, and the goal is to determine the momentum of a photon required to transition the molecule to the next state with the lowest possible energy.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Energy Transitions**:  
   The molecule's energy levels are a combination of rotational and vibrational contributions. The fundamental state corresponds to \( v = 0, J = 0 \). The next state with the lowest energy could involve either:
   - A **rotational transition** (\( J = 0 \to J = 1 \)), requiring energy \( \Delta E = 2hB \), where \( B \) is the rotational constant.
   - A **vibrational transition** (\( v = 0 \to v = 1 \)), requiring energy \( \Delta E = h\omega \).

   The rotational transition requires significantly less energy than the vibrational transition, as shown in the calculations below.

2. **Rotational Constant \( B \)**:  
   The rotational constant \( B \) is calculated using the formula:
   \[
   B = \frac{h}{8\pi^2 I},
   \]
   where \( I = \mu R^2 \) is the moment of inertia, and \( \mu = \frac{M_x M_y}{M_x + M_y} \) is the reduced mass.  
   - \( \mu = \frac{20 \times 2}{20 + 2} = 1.818 \, \text{amu} = 3.017 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg} \).  
   - \( R = 2 \, \text{angstroms} = 2 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m} \), so \( R^2 = 4 \times 10^{-20} \, \text{m}^2 \).  
   - \( I = \mu R^2 = 3.017 \times 10^{-27} \times 4 \times 10^{-20} = 1.207 \times 10^{-46} \, \text{kg·m}^2 \).  
   - Substituting into \( B \), \( B = \frac{6.626 \times 10^{-34}}{8\pi^2 \times 1.207 \times 10^{-46}} \approx 6.95 \times 10^{10} \, \text{s}^{-1} \).

   The energy for the rotational transition (\( J = 0 \to J = 1 \)) is:
   \[
   \Delta E = 2hB = 2 \times 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \times 6.95 \times 10^{10} \approx 9.21 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}.
   \]

3. **Vibrational Transition**:  
   The energy for the vibrational transition (\( v = 0 \to v = 1 \)) is:
   \[
   \Delta E = h\omega = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \times 4 \times 10^{14} \approx 2.65 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}.
   \]

4. **Photon Momentum**:  
   The momentum of the photon is related to its energy by \( p = \frac{E}{c} \), where \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \).  
   - For the **rotational transition**, \( p = \frac{9.21 \times 10^{-23}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 3.07 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{kg·m/s} \), which is far smaller than any of the given options.  
   - For the **vibrational transition**, \( p = \frac{2.65 \times 10^{-19}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 8.83 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{kg·m/s} \), which is closest to option **A** (\( 1.9 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{N·s} \)) but still not an exact match.

5. **Conclusion**:  
   The rotational transition requires less energy than the vibrational transition, but the calculated momentum for the rotational transition is far smaller than the given options. The vibrational transition momentum (\( 8.83 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{kg·m/s} \)) is closer to option **A** (\( 1.9 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{N·s} \)), though not exact. Given the options, the best match appears to be **A**.

ANSWER: A
