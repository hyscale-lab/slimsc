Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The question is asking how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. The options are various inverse powers of plx.

Wait, parallax is related to distance, right? Oh right, the parallax in arcseconds (") is inversely proportional to the distance in parsecs. So, plx = 1/distance. So a star with a parallax of 1 pc is 1 parsec away, and a parallax of 0.5 pc would be 2 parsecs away.

Now, the stars are uniformly distributed. So the number density of stars doesn't depend on distance, but let's clarify: uniform distribution in space would mean that there's the same number of stars per unit volume everywhere. But wait, wait—wait, the problem says they're uniformly distributed in the sky. Hmm, maybe that's a bit ambiguous. Does that mean uniform in the sky (like on the celestial sphere) or uniform in space? I think in astronomy, when we say uniform distribution on the sky, it's often considered as uniform in solid angle, but the question here might be about the number per unit parallax range.

Wait, no, the question is about the number per unit range of parallax. So, the number of stars with a certain parallax. Let me think about how distance relates to parallax.

Parallax p is related to distance d by p = 1/d (in parsecs). So for a given range of parallax, say from p to p + dp, what's the corresponding range in distance?

Hmm, if p = 1/d, then d = 1/p. So when p increases by dp, d changes by dd. Let me compute dd in terms of dp.

Differentiating both sides of d = 1/p: dd = - (1/p²) dp. But since we're looking for the number of stars in a positive range, maybe I can ignore the negative sign for now.

So, the change in distance, dd, is proportional to (1/p²) dp. Wait, but how does this relate to the number of stars?

Wait, if stars are uniformly distributed in space, their number density n is constant. So the number of stars in a volume element dV would be n * dV. But dV in spherical coordinates is 4π r² dr (since for a thin shell, the volume is surface area times thickness). So dN = n * 4π r² dr.

But wait, the parallax p is 1/r. So r = 1/p. So dr = - (1/p²) dp, as I had before.

So, substituting r =1/p, dr = - (1/p²) dp. So the number of stars dN in a parallax range dp is:

dN = n * 4π (1/p)^2 * (-1/p² dp)

Wait, but the negative sign just indicates that as p increases, r decreases. Since we're considering the number of stars, we can take the absolute value, so dN is proportional to (1/p²) * (1/p²) dp?

Wait wait, let me recast this. Let's express everything in terms of p.

We have dV = 4π r² dr, and r = 1/p.

So r² = (1/p)^2 = 1/p². And dr = - (1/p²) dp.

So dV = 4π (1/p²) * (-1/p² dp) = 4π (-1/p^4) dp.

But the number of stars is n*dV, so dN = n * 4π (-1/p^4) dp. Again, the negative indicates direction, so we can take the magnitude, so dN = n *4π (1/p^4) dp.

Wait, but the question is about the number per unit range of parallax, so it's dN per dp. So that would be proportional to 1/p^4. So the number of stars per unit range of parallax (dN/dp) is proportional to 1/p^4.

So looking at the options, option A is ~ 1/plx^4.

But wait, wait a minute. Am I making a mistake here? Because when we consider the distribution of stars, sometimes it's about the apparent distribution on the sky, which might not be the same as the actual spatial distribution.

Wait, the question says "stars are uniformly distributed in the sky." Oh, perhaps that's a different scenario. Uniform on the sky could imply that their distribution on the celestial sphere is uniform, which would mean that, for a given distance, they are uniformly distributed in angles, but not necessarily in three-dimensional space.

Wait, but the question is about the number per unit parallax. So perhaps another approach is needed.

Alternatively, considering that for stars at a given distance d (parallax p=1/d), the solid angle they subtend is dA = 4π (r²), but that's in 3D space. Wait, perhaps I'm complicating this.

Wait, another approach: the number of stars in a thin shell at distance d with thickness dr is proportional to the surface area of the shell times the number density.

The surface area is 4π d². The number of stars in that shell would be 4π d² * n * dr, where n is the number density (number per unit volume). So the number per unit distance dr is 4π n d².

But since the question is about parallax, let's express this in terms of p.

p = 1/d, so d = 1/p. Then, d² = 1/p². And dr = - (1/p²) dp, so the number in a parallax interval dp is 4π n (1/p²) (1/p²) dp, which is 4π n (1/p^4) dp. So dN/dp = 4π n / p^4, which is proportional to 1/p^4.

So the number per unit parallax range decreases as 1/p^4.

But wait, another way: when you have a uniform distribution in space, the number of stars at a distance between d and d+dd is proportional to d² dd (since the volume of a thin shell is 4π d² dd). So the number per unit distance is proportional to d².

But since d = 1/p, that becomes p^-2. Wait, no, the number per unit d is d², so per unit p, since p=1/d, which is d=1/p, d² is (1/p)^2 = 1/p².

Wait, but when you change variables from d to p, you have to account for the Jacobian, which is the derivative dd/dp. Since p=1/d, dp/dd = -1/d². So |dp/dd| = 1/d².

So the number of stars per unit p would be (number per unit d) multiplied by (dd/dp). So if the number per unit d is proportional to d², then (d²) * (dd/dp) becomes d² * (1/d²) * (1) )? Wait, let me rephrase.

Let me consider the number per unit d. It's N(d) = k * d², where k is a constant.

But when you change variables to p, where p=1/d, so d=1/p. So N(d) = k (1/p)^2.

But to find the number per unit p, you have to multiply by the derivative of d with respect to p: dN/dp = N(d) * (dd/dp) = k (1/p^2) * ( -1/(p²) ) ) = -k/(p^4).

The negative sign indicates that as p increases, d decreases, but the magnitude is k/p^4.

So the number per unit parallax p is proportional to 1/p^4. So the correct answer would be option A: ~1/plx^4.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because earlier I thought about the spatial distribution and the Jacobian. Alternatively, maybe considering the area on the sky.

Wait, another approach: the number of stars with parallax between p and p+dp is the same as the number of stars at distances between d and d+dd, where d=1/p.

Since stars are uniformly distributed, the number per unit volume is constant, say n.

So the number of stars in a thin shell at radius r (d=r) with thickness dr is 4π r² dr * n.

Expressed in terms of p, where r=1/p, dr = - (1/p²) dp.

So substituting, the number is 4π (1/p)^2 * (-1/p² dp) * n = -4π n (1/p^4) dp.

The negative indicates that as p increases, r decreases, but the magnitude is positive.

So the number per unit p is proportional to 1/p^4.

Hence, so the answer would be A: ~1/plx^4.

The question asks how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, assuming stars are uniformly distributed in space. Parallax \( p \) is related to distance \( d \) by \( p = 1/d \) (in parsecs). The number of stars in a thin shell at distance \( d \) with thickness \( dd \) is proportional to the surface area of the shell, \( 4\pi d^2 \), multiplied by the number density of stars \( n \), giving \( dN = 4\pi n d^2 dd \).

To express this in terms of \( p \), we use \( d = 1/p \) and \( dd = -1/p^2 dp \). Substituting these into the expression for \( dN \), we get:

\[
dN = 4\pi n \left(\frac{1}{p^2}\right) \left(-\frac{1}{p^2} dp\right) = -\frac{4\pi n}{p^4} dp.
\]

The negative sign indicates that as \( p \) increases, \( d \) decreases, but the magnitude of the number of stars per unit parallax range is proportional to \( 1/p^4 \). Thus, the number of stars per unit range of parallax decreases as \( 1/p^4 \).

The correct answer is:

**Answer: A**
