Okay, so I have this question about detecting transiting planets, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The setup is that there are two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. The researchers want to observe the one with the highest probability of transiting because they have limited time. Both have been detected via the RV method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. Oh, and both have the same mass but different orbital periods. Planet_1's period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. Also, both have circular orbits.

Wait, and the host stars: Planet_1's star is twice as massive as Planet_2's. But both stars have the same radius because Planet_2's host is slightly evolved. So same radius but different masses.

The question is about which planet has a higher probability of transiting, so the researchers should observe that one.

Hmm, I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the star and the orbit of the planet. The transit probability is higher when the planet's orbital plane is edge-on relative to us. But I think the probability is calculated using the size of the star and the distance of the planet's orbit.

Wait, let me think. The transit probability formula, if I remember right, is (R*) / a, where R* is the star's radius and a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. But wait, no, that's not exactly right. Wait, the probability is actually the ratio of the star's radius to the distance from the star to the planet (semi-major axis), multiplied by some function involving the inclination, but I think for random orientations, the probability is approximated as the ratio of the star's radius to the semi-major axis.

Wait, no, that's the area of the star's disk relative to the planet's orbital area. Oh wait, the probability is the ratio of the area of the star (which is πR²) to the area of the sphere that the planet's orbit sweeps around the star. No, wait, maybe it's a different approach.

Wait, I think the probability that a planet transits is given by (R*/a) * (1/(1 + (M_planet/M_star)^(1/3))) ), but I'm not sure. Or perhaps it's (R*/a) multiplied by something else.

Wait, no, maybe I should think in terms of geometry. The transit occurs when the planet's orbital plane is aligned edge-on with our line of sight. The probability is the ratio of the area where this alignment occurs (which is a small circle) compared to the total possible area for the planet's orbit.

Alternatively, I think the formula is roughly (R* / a) * ( (1) / (1 + (M_p / M_*) )^{1/3} )

Wait, but let me get back. The transit probability P is given by:

P = (R*/a) * [ (1) / ( ( (M_*/M_sun) + (M_p/M_sun) )^{1/3} ) ) ] 

Wait, no, maybe that's not right. Alternatively, I remember that the transit probability is given by (R_star / a) * (1 / (1 + (M_p / M_* )^(1/3) )) )

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think: The transit probability is highest when the planet is closer to the star because a is smaller, so R*/a is larger. So closer planets have a higher chance of transiting.

Wait, but wait, the RV method already found both planets. So they have known masses, but we have to calculate the probability of transit based on their semi-major axes.

Wait, the problem says that both planets have the same mass. So M_p1 = M_p2.

But their semi-major axes are different. Because their orbital periods are different, and the host stars have different masses. Because from Kepler's third law: (a^3)/(P^2) = (M_*) / (M_sun) ), approximately. Or more accurately, (a^3)/(P^2) = (M_* + M_p)/M_sun, but since M_p is much smaller, it's roughly (a^3)/(P^2) ≈ M_*/M_sun.

Given that, let's compute the semi-major axes for each planet.

Let me denote:

For Planet_1: Period is P1, Star mass is M1 = 2 * M2 (since M1 is twice M2's mass).

Wait, no, wait: The question says the host of Planet_1 has twice the mass of the host of Planet_2. So M1 = 2 * M2.

Given that, and that P1 = P2 / 3.

Wait, wait, the orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than Planet_2's. So P1 = (1/3) P2.

So for Kepler's third law, we can write:

a^3 ∝ M_* * P^2.

So for each planet:

a1^3 = (M1) * (P1)^2.

a2^3 = (M2) * (P2)^2.

We can write a1 in terms of a2.

Let me compute a1/a2.

a1^3 / a2^3 = (M1 / M2) * (P1^2 / P2^2 )

Substitute M1 = 2 M2, P1 = P2 /3.

So,

a1^3 / a2^3 = (2 M2 / M2) * ( (P2/3)^2 / P2^2 )

Simplify:

= 2 * ( (P2^2 /9 ) / P2^2 )
= 2 * (1/9) )
= 2/9.

So a1^3 = (2/9) a2^3 → a1 = a2 * (2/9)^(1/3).

Compute (2/9)^(1/3). Let me think: 2/9 is approximately 0.222. The cube root of 0.222 is about 0.6, since 0.6^3 = 0.216, which is close. So a1 ≈ 0.6 a2.

Alternatively, exact calculation: 0.222 is roughly 2/9, so cube root is (2/9)^(1/3) = (2^(1/3)) / (9^(1/3)) ) = 2^(1/3) / (3^2)^(1/3) ) = 2^(1/3) / 3^(2/3) ) = (2/3^2)^(1/3) ) = (2/9)^(1/3) ≈ 0.6.

So a1 is about 0.6 times a2.

Wait, but to be precise, let's compute (2/9)^(1/3):

Let me compute 2/9 = 0.2222.

Cube root of 0.2222: since 0.6^3=0.216, 0.605^3 is approximately 0.222. So approximately 0.605.

So a1 ≈ 0.605 a2.

Now, the transit probability P is proportional to (R*/a) multiplied by something else.

Wait, what's the exact formula for the transit probability?

I think the probability of a planet transiting is given by:

P ≈ (R*/a) * (1 / (1 + (M_p/(M_*))^(1/3)) )

But wait, since M_p is much smaller than M_*, the denominator is approximately 1. So P ≈ R*/a.

Wait, but wait, another source says that the transit probability is approximately (R*/a), assuming that the star's mass dominates (so M_p << M_*). So P ≈ (R*/a), because for a randomly oriented orbit, the probability that the planet's orbital plane is aligned edge-on enough to cause a transit is roughly the ratio of the star's radius to the semi-major axis. Because the impact parameter (the distance from the star's center to the planet's path as seen from Earth) needs to be less than R*/a, so the probability is proportional to R*/a.

Wait, but wait, another thought: The transit probability is also affected by the size of the planet. Oh, right, but the question says both are Earth-like, so their sizes are similar, so that factor would be the same for both. So it would cancel out when comparing the two probabilities.

So, for the purpose of comparing which planet is more likely to transit, the probability is proportional to (R*/a), because the other factors (like planet size) are the same for both.

Wait, but wait, in reality, the transit probability is given by (R*/a) * ( (R_p + R_*) ) / (a) ), but no, I'm mixing up things. Let me get back.

The transit probability is given by the formula:

P = (R_* + R_p) / a * (something), but perhaps that's not exactly right. Alternatively, it can be approximated as (R_*)/a, with some small correction for the planet's size, but since both planets are Earth-like, which is much smaller than their stars, R_p << R_*, so (R_* + R_p) ≈ R_*, so maybe we can ignore R_p.

So, the transit probability is approximately (R_*) / a.

But wait, I need to confirm this. Let me recall: The probability that a planet transits is the probability that, from our line of sight, the planet's orbit is edge-on enough such that the planet passes in front of the star. The condition is that the planet's orbital plane's normal vector makes an angle i with our line of sight, where i is the inclination. For a transit, i must be close to 90 degrees (edge-on).

The probability calculation involves the area where the planet's orbit's normal is within a certain angle that allows a transit. The formula, I think, is P = (R_*) / a, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, it's (R_*) / (a) multiplied by (1 / (1 + (M_p/M_*)^(1/3)) ), but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps it's better to look up the exact formula, but since I can't do that right now, I'll proceed with the reasoning that P ∝ (R_*)/a.

Wait, but the stars have the same radius. The problem says that both host stars have the same radii because Planet_2's host is slightly evolved but has the same radius. So R1 = R2 = R.

So, the transit probability for each planet is proportional to R/a for each.

So for Planet_1, P1 ∝ R/(a1).

For Planet_2, P2 ∝ R/(a2).

Since R is the same for both, the ratio P1/P2 = (R/a1) / (R/a2) ) = a2/a1.

From earlier, a1 ≈ 0.605 a2 → a2 = a1 / 0.605 ≈ 1.65 a1.

So P1/P2 = a2/a1 → (1.65 a1) / a1 = 1.65.

So P1 is 1.65 times P2.

Wait no, wait: P1 = R/a1, P2 = R/a2. So P1/P2 = (R/a1)/(R/a2) ) = a2/a1.

Earlier, a1 = 0.605 a2 → a2 = a1 / 0.605 = approximately 1.65 a1.

So a2/a1 = 1.65. So P1/P2 = 1.65 → P1 = 1.65 * P2.

Which means Planet_1 has a higher transit probability than Planet_2.

Wait, but wait, that's the opposite of what I thought earlier. Because a1 is smaller, R/a1 is larger, so P1 is larger.

Wait, but wait, I think I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me redo the a1 and a2.

We have:

a1^3 = M1 * P1^2.

a2^3 = M2 * P2^2.

Given that M1 = 2 M2, and P1 = P2 /3.

Wait, let me plug in numbers.

Let me let M2 = M, so M1 = 2M.

P2 is the period of Planet_2, so P1 = P2/3.

So,

a1^3 = (2M) * (P2/3)^2 = (2M) * P2^2 /9.

a2^3 = M * P2^2.

So a1^3 = (2/9) * (M P2^2) ) → a1^3 = (2/9) a2^3 → a1 = a2 * (2/9)^(1/3).

Compute 2/9 = 0.222..., cube root is approximately 0.605, as before.

So a1 = 0.605 a2.

Now, the transit probability for Planet_1 is P1 = R/(a1), and for Planet_2 it's P2 = R/(a2).

So P1 = R/(0.605 a2) = (R/a2) * (1/0.605) ≈ (R/a2) * 1.65.

So P1 = 1.65 * P2 → So Planet_1's probability is higher by a factor of about 1.65 times Planet_2's.

So the researchers should choose Planet_1 because it has a higher transit probability.

Looking at the options:

Option C says "Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher probability to transit."

Option D says "Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~2.7 times higher probability."

Wait, but according to my calculation, it's 1.65 times, so option C is correct.

Wait, but I need to make sure I didn't mix up anything else.

Wait, the problem states that both host stars have the same radius, so R1 = R2 = R.

Earlier, I thought the probability is (R/a), which would give P1 ∝ 1/(0.605 a2) = 1.65/(a2), and P2 is 1/(a2). So the ratio is 1.65, so P1 is higher.

Yes, that seems correct. So the correct answer would be option C or D. Wait, option C says 1.65 times higher for Planet_1, which matches.

So the researchers should choose Planet_1 because it has a higher probability (1.65 times) to transit.

Wait, but wait another thought: Could the mass of the star affect the transit probability beyond just the semi-major axis? Because the formula I used assumes that P is proportional to R/a, but perhaps the mass affects the semi-major axis more, which we've accounted for. But since we've already accounted for a based on the star's mass, I think the calculation is correct.

So the answer should be option C.

To determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting, we analyze the transit probability formula. The transit probability \( P \) is approximately proportional to the ratio of the star's radius \( R_* \) to the planet's semi-major axis \( a \), i.e., \( P \propto \frac{R_*}{a} \). Since both host stars have the same radius (\( R_1 = R_2 = R \)), the transit probability depends on the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.

### Step 1: Calculate the semi-major axes
Using Kepler's third law, \( a^3 \propto M_* \cdot P^2 \), where \( M_* \) is the mass of the host star and \( P \) is the orbital period. For Planet_1 and Planet_2:

- Planet_1: \( M_1 = 2M_2 \), \( P_1 = \frac{P_2}{3} \)
- Planet_2: \( M_2 \), \( P_2 \)

The ratio of the semi-major axes is:

\[
\frac{a_1^3}{a_2^3} = \frac{M_1 \cdot P_1^2}{M_2 \cdot P_2^2} = \frac{2M_2 \cdot \left(\frac{P_2}{3}\right)^2}{M_2 \cdot P_2^2} = \frac{2}{9}
\]

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left(\frac{2}{9}\right)^{1/3} \approx 0.605
\]

Thus, \( a_1 \approx 0.605 \cdot a_2 \).

### Step 2: Compare transit probabilities
The transit probability is proportional to \( \frac{R_*}{a} \). Since \( R_* \) is the same for both stars, the ratio of transit probabilities is:

\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \frac{\frac{R}{a_1}}{\frac{R}{a_2}} = \frac{a_2}{a_1} = \frac{1}{0.605} \approx 1.65
\]

This means Planet_1 has approximately 1.65 times the transit probability of Planet_2.

### Step 3: Evaluate the options
- **Option A**: Incorrect. Planet_2 does not have a higher probability.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. The probability difference is not 1.5 times.
- **Option C**: Correct. Planet_1 has a ~1.65 times higher probability to transit.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. The probability difference is not 2.7 times.

### Conclusion
Planet_1 has a higher transit probability due to its smaller semi-major axis, making it the better choice for observation.
