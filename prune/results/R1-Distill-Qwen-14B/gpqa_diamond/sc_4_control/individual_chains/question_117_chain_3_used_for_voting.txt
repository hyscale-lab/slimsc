Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry question in front of me, and I'm trying to figure out which of these compounds exhibit optical isomerism. Optical isomerism, right, that's when compounds are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, meaning they have chiral centers. So, the compounds need to have at least one chiral center or some other form of stereoisomerism like geometric isomerism, but wait, optical isomerism specifically refers to enantiomers which are chiral.

Let me look at the options one by one.

The question lists four compounds:

1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate
2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate
3. benzophenone
4. dimethyl fumarate

And the options are A, B, C, D, each listing which of these have optical isomerism.

Hmm. I need to evaluate each compound for the presence of chiral centers or some other source of chirality.

Starting with compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. So, it's a biphenyl structure. Let me imagine the structure. Biphenyl has two benzene rings connected by a single bond. The substituents are on the second position of each ring (2,2'), and also on the 6,6' positions with nitro groups. The other parts are the dimethyl dicarboxylate groups.

Wait, so the molecule is symmetrical? Let's see. The arrangement of the substituents: the two nitro groups are on 6 and 6', and the two carboxylate groups are on 2 and 2'. So, in biphenyl, the positions 2 and 6 are across from each other. If each ring has substituents at 2,2' and 6,6', perhaps the molecule is symmetrical. But wait, the two substituents on each ring are the same: methyl dicarboxylate and nitro groups.

Wait, but the central bond is a single bond, so the two rings can rotate. So, is there a plane of symmetry? If the substituents are in positions that make the molecule symmetrical, then it might not have a chiral center. But wait, does it have a chiral center?

Wait, the substituents on the biphenyl: each ring has two substituents, but what about the arrangement? Let me think about the groups attached. The groups at 2 on each ring are the same (dicarboxylate methyl ester), and the groups at 6 are nitro. So, maybe the molecule is symmetrical across the central bond, making it not chiral. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the biphenyl in this structure is substituted in such a way that it's a meso compound, making it achiral.

Alternatively, maybe the substituents lead to a chiral center. But wait, the biphenyl itself isn't a chiral center. So, unless there's another chiral center elsewhere.

Wait, the dicarboxylate groups are on the 2,2' positions. Each is connected to a methyl ester. So, each of those is a methyl group attached to the oxygen of the ester. But those are symmetric, so perhaps no chiral centers there.

Wait, maybe the molecule has a plane of symmetry. The structure might be symmetrical, making it a meso compound and thus not chiral. So, maybe compound 1 doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Moving on to compound 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Let's draw that structure. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO-, but wait, methyl ester. So, the formula is CH2CH(OH)COOCH3.

Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is glycolic acid. The ester would be methyl glycolate. So, the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Wait, no, wait. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO-, but 2-hydroxypropanoate would have the hydroxyl on the middle carbon. So, structure: O
              |
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-OH

Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting that wrong. Let me write it step by step. The propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. For 2-hydroxypropanoate, the hydroxyl is on the second carbon. So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Wait, no, wait. Wait, propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. So the positions are 1, 2, 3. 2-hydroxypropanoate would be HO-CH2-CH2-COO- but that doesn't seem right. Wait, maybe it's CH3-C(OH)H-COOCH3. Oh wait, no, because propanoate has three carbons: the first is the methyl (CH2-), the second is the middle (CH-), the third is the COO- group.

Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate would be the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. So, the structure is CH3-C(OH)H-COOCH3. So, the middle carbon is connected to OH, COOCH3, and two CH3 groups? No, wait, the propanoate would be CH2CH(OH)COOCH3?

Wait, no. Propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. 2-hydroxy would be HOCH2CH2COOH. So, the ester would be the methyl ester: HOCH2CH2COOCH3. So, the structure is OMe-O-C-O-CH2CH2-OH. Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So, the carbon chain is CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3. So, the middle carbon is CH2 connected to OH and CH2COOCH3. So, the central carbon is the CH2 with OH, but wait, that's a CH2 group, which is symmetric. So, it's -CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3.

Wait, no, wait. In the 2-hydroxypropanoate, the hydroxyl is on the second carbon of the propanoate. So, the structure is CH3-C(OH)H-COOCH3. Wait, that would be the case because propanoate is three carbons: the first is CH3, the second is CH-, the third is COO-. So, 2-hydroxy would mean OH on the second carbon. So, the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3, but wait, that would be a three-carbon chain.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting stuck here. Let me think about the molecule: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. So, the propanoate is CH2CH2COOCH3, but with an OH on the second carbon. So, the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So, that's the same as glycolic acid's methyl ester.

Now, does this molecule have a chiral center? Let's see: the central carbon (the second carbon) is attached to four different groups. The groups connected to it are: OH, CH2COOCH3, and two CH2 groups? Wait, no. Let me clarify.

The structure is:

O
|
COOCH3
|
CH2-CH(OH)-CH3?

Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing it up. Let me number the carbons:

Carbon 1: COOCH3 group.
Carbon 2: connected to OH, Carbon 1, and two other carbons.
Wait, perhaps the structure is:

CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Wait, that would make the second carbon (the one with OH) connected to:

- OH group,
- CH2COOCH3 (which is a longer chain),
- and two CH2 groups? No, wait, no. Because the second carbon is CH2(OH), so perhaps it's:

CH2(OH) connected to the next carbon, which is CH2, and then the COOCH3. So, the second carbon (the one with OH) is CH2(OH), which is connected to two CH2 groups on either side. Wait, no, that can't be right. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe it's HOC-CH2-COOCH3. Wait, no, that's only three carbons. So, the structure is:

CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So, the middle carbon (the one with OH) is connected to:

- OH group,
- two CH2 groups (one on each side),
- and the COOCH3 group.

Wait, but that can't be because if it's CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3, the middle carbon is the second CH2.

Wait, perhaps I should draw it as:

The molecule is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3? Wait, that would be 2-hydroxypropanoate. Oh wait, no, because in that case, the second carbon (the middle one) has OH, CH3, COOCH3, and another CH3? No, that can't be.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's think of it as the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. The acid is CH3CH(OH)COOH. So, the ester would be CH3CH(OH)COOCH3.

So, the structure is:

CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

So, the central carbon (the one with OH) is attached to:

- a methyl group (CH3),
- a hydroxyl group (OH),
- a carbonyl group connected to OCH3,
- and the other side is connected to the adjacent carbon.

Wait, no. The central carbon is CH, attached to:

- CH3,
- OH,
- COOCH3,
- and the neighboring CH (from the CH3 group). Wait, that can't be right.

Wait, the molecule is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So, the central CH is connected to:

1. CH3,
2. OH,
3. COOCH3,
4. the adjacent CH.

Wait, but wait, the adjacent CH is connected to the COOCH3. So, the central carbon (second carbon) has attached groups: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and another CH (from the COOCH3 side). Hmm, this is getting a bit tangled.

Wait, perhaps the central carbon is connected to:

- CH3,
- OH,
- COOCH3,
- and another CH2 group.

Wait, no, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think in terms of the molecule: CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

So, the central carbon (the one with OH) is the second carbon. It's connected to:

- CH3 (from the first carbon),
- OH,
- COOCH3 (from the third carbon),
- and the third carbon is connected via a single bond.

Wait, but that would make the central carbon connected to three different groups: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and the third carbon. Wait, no, the third carbon is part of the same chain. So, the central carbon (second) is connected to:

- CH3,
- OH,
- COOCH3,
- and the third carbon (which is a carbonyl group, but the group is O-CO-OCH3).

Wait, perhaps I should think about the four substituents on the central carbon. So, substituents are:

1. CH3 group,
2. OH,
3. COOCH3 group,
4. and the adjacent carbon, which is the third carbon (but that's part of the same chain, so maybe it's just a single bond).

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck, but perhaps it's easier to visualize: the central carbon is attached to four different groups. So, if that's the case, then the compound has a chiral center and would exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, so methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a central carbon with four different substituents: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and another CH from the adjacent carbon? Wait, perhaps not. Let me think again.

Wait, CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3: the central carbon is CH(OH), connected to:

- CH3,
- OH,
- COOCH3,
- and the adjacent C (which is connected to COOCH3).

Wait, that makes the substituents: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and a CH2COOCH3 group? Or perhaps I should think about the substituents as being:

- a methyl group (CH3),
- a hydroxyl group (OH),
- an ester group (O-CO-OCH3),
- and the adjacent CH group.

Wait, but in any case, the central carbon is connected to four different groups, so it must be a chiral center. Therefore, compound 2 has optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait a second. If the molecule is symmetrical, then maybe it's a meso compound. But in this case, the substituents are different on all four sides, so it's not a meso compound. Therefore, it should have optical isomerism. So, compound 2 shows optical isomerism.

Moving on to compound 3: benzophenone. Benzophenone is (phenyl)(phenyl)ketone, structure Ph-CO-Ph. So, the molecule has a ketone group in the center, with two benzene rings attached.

Does benzophenone have any chiral centers? Well, the central carbon is connected to two phenyl groups and two oxygen atoms (from the ketone). Wait, the structure is:

Ph–C(=O)–Ph.

So, the central carbon is double-bonded to O, and connected to two phenyl groups. So, the valence is: two phenyl groups, one O (double bond), and another single bond (but that's part of the carbonyl group). No, wait, the carbonyl carbon has double bond to O, and single bonds to two phenyl groups and the other side is connected to the oxygen.

Wait, the carbonyl carbon (the C in CO) is double-bonded to O, and has two phenyl groups attached. So, the central carbon has two phenyl groups, one O (double bond), and the other two bonds are part of the carbonyl group. So, the structure is symmetric because both substituents on either side of the carbonyl are phenyl groups. So, the molecule is symmetrical along the plane through the carbonyl group. Therefore, it's not chiral because it lacks a chiral center. Additionally, benzophenone doesn't have any other stereogenic centers. So, compound 3 doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Compound 4: dimethyl fumarate. Fumarate is the di-ester of maleic acid. The structure of fumarate is CH2=CH-CO-O-CO-CH2CH2? No, wait, wait. Fumarate is derived from maleic acid, which is HOOC-CHCH-COOH. When esterified with two methyl groups, it becomes (CH3O)OC-CHCH-CO-OCH3.

Wait, the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
   \
    C=CH2
   /
O-C-OCH3

Wait, no, perhaps more accurately, fumarate is (Z)-butenedioic acid. So, the structure is CH2CH2(COOCH3)2, but with a double bond. So, the structure is CH2=CH-C(COOCH3)2.

Wait, no, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again: Fumaric acid is (E)-butenedioic acid: HOOC-CH2CH2-COOH. Wait, no, wait: fumaric acid is (E)-HO2C-CH=CH-CO2H. So, the two COOH groups are on opposite sides of the double bond.

So, when esterified with methanol, both -OH groups become OCH3. So, the structure becomes OCH3OOC-CH=CH-COO-OCH3, but with the double bond in between.

Wait, more precisely, the structure is O
                              |
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2=CH
|
O-C-OCH3

No, wait, it's O=C-OCH3 attached to each end of the double bond. So, the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3 – CH2–CH2 – O-C-OCH3

No, no, wait, fumarate is a diester of maleic acid. So, the structure should be O
                              |
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2–CH
      \
       C(=O)-OCH3

Wait, perhaps it's more accurate to represent it as:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2–CH–C(=O)-OCH3

Wait, no, the structure is (E)-butenedioate. So, the structure is CH2CH2(COOCH3)2 with a double bond. So, the correct structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2–CH2
|
O-C-OCH3

Wait, no, no, correct structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2–CH
      \
       C(=O)-OCH3

Wait, perhaps it's O=C-OCH3 group on each end of the double bond. So, the structure is O=C-OCH3 - CH2-CH2 - O=C-OCH3. No, I'm getting this wrong. Let me think of it as the diester of fumaric acid.

Fumaric acid is HO2C-CH2-CH2-CO2H, but wait, no, that's succinic acid. No, fumaric acid is (E)-HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. So, the ester would have two methyl ester groups.

So, the structure is O
             ||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH
     \
      C(=O)-OCH3

Wait, no, that's not correct. The double bond is between the two CH groups. So, the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2–CH–C(=O)-OCH3

Wait, perhaps it's better to write it as:

O=C-OCH3
   |
CH2–CH2–C(=O)-OCH3

No, wait, no. Fumarate has a double bond between the two carbons bearing the ester groups. So, the structure should be:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2–CH2
|
O-C-OCH3

Wait, no, that's succinate. Fumarate has a double bond. So, the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2–CH
      \
       C(=O)-OCH3

No, that doesn't seem right. Let me try again. Fumarate is the di-ester of (E)-butenedioic acid. So, the structure would be:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2–CH–C(=O)-OCH3

Wait, but that's not incorporating the double bond. Oh right, the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2–CH
      \
       C(=O)-OCH3

Wait, no. Let me think of it as O
                              ||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2–CH2–C(=O)-OCH3

No, that's not correct. The correct structure is O
                              ||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2–CH2–C(=O)-OCH3

No, that's actually the structure of the succinate ester. Fumarate has a double bond between the two CH groups.

Ah, I think I'm getting stuck on the structure, but perhaps I should just focus on whether it has any stereoisomerism. Fumarate is a diastereomer of maleate. Since the double bond is in the trans configuration, does that lead to any geometric isomerism or optical isomerism?

Wait, fumaric acid is (E)-butenedioic acid, and when esterified, it becomes dimethyl fumarate. The molecule has a double bond with two ester groups on either end. So, the structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2, but wait, that would be a five-carbon chain. Hmm, perhaps I should think of it as the central double bond with ester groups on each end.

In any case, the key point is whether the molecule has a chiral center or some other form of stereoisomerism that leads to optical isomerism.

Wait, dimethyl fumarate is a trans diester. The molecule has the two ester groups opposite each other across the double bond. So, since the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it's not chiral. Alternatively, if there's a possibility for enantiomers, but I'm not sure.

Wait, no, because the molecule is symmetrical across the double bond. So, the two ester groups are on opposite sides, making the molecule achiral. Alternatively, maybe the molecule isn't symmetrical and thus could be chiral.

Wait, let's think about the structure again. For dimethyl fumarate, the structure is (E)-CH2CH(COOCH3)2. No, wait, the structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2. But in the (E) configuration, the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond.

Wait, but in that case, the molecule has a plane of symmetry, so it's not chiral. So, it can't have optical isomerism because it's achiral.

Wait, but wait, another possibility: does the molecule have a center of chirality? Let's see. Each of the carbons attached to the double bond has two ester groups and two CH2 groups.

No, each carbon in the double bond is connected to two ester groups and two other carbons. So, each of those carbons (the CH2 groups) have the same substituents, so they can't be chiral centers.

Wait, but perhaps the molecule is a meso compound. Let me think: if the molecule has two identical substituents on either end of the double bond, and those substituents are arranged symmetrically, then it could be a meso compound, making it achiral.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is not symmetrical. Wait, in the case of dimethyl fumarate, each ester group is attached to a CH2 on either end of the double bond. So, the structure is CH2–COOCH3 on each end, connected by a double bond. So, the structure is (E)-CH2–COOCH3-CH2–COOCH3, with the double bond in the middle.

Wait, that would make the molecule symmetric because each end is identical. So, it's a meso compound and thus not chiral. So, compound 4 doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me think again. If the substituents on either end of the double bond are the same, then any possible stereoisomer would be a meso form, making it achiral. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate doesn't have optical isomerism.

Wait, but another angle: what about if the double bond is in the cis position, making the molecule chiral? But dimethyl fumarate is the trans isomer. So, in the cis case, would that create a chiral center?

Wait, in the case of cis-fumarate, the two ester groups are on the same side. But each of the carbons attached to the double bond would have two ester groups. Let me think: each carbon in the double bond is connected to two ester groups and two CH2 groups.

Wait, each carbon is connected to two ester groups (O-C-OCH3 groups) and two CH2 groups. But since the ester groups are the same, the carbons can't be chiral centers because they have two identical substituents.

Wait, wait. Let me imagine a molecule where each of the double-bonded carbons has two identical substituents. So, each has two ester groups, so they can't be chiral centers because they have two identical groups. So, the molecule as a whole doesn't have any chiral centers, so it's not chiral. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. So, in any case, compound 4 doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

So, let's recap:

Compound 1: I'm not entirely sure, but earlier I thought it might be symmetrical, so no optical isomerism.

Compound 2: Has a chiral center. So, yes, optical isomerism.

Compound 3: No chiral centers, so no.

Compound 4: No, because of symmetry, so no.

Wait, but wait, I might have made a mistake with compound 4. Because dimethyl fumarate is (E)-configured, but maybe the molecule has geometric isomerism (cis/trans), but that's a different type of isomerism (stereoisomerism), not optical isomerism. Wait, wait: optical isomerism specifically refers to enantiomers, which require a chiral center. So, if a molecule doesn't have a chiral center, it can't have optical isomerism, even if it has other forms of stereoisomerism.

So, for a compound to exhibit optical isomerism, it must have a chiral center or another form of asymmetry leading to non-superimposable mirror images. But if the molecule isn't chiral, then it can't have optical isomerism.

So, for each compound:

1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

Is this molecule symmetrical? Let me imagine the structure. Biphenyl has two benzene rings connected by a single bond. The substituents are at 2,2' and 6,6' positions. So, each benzene ring has a nitro group at position 6 and a dicarboxylate methyl ester at position 2.

But in a biphenyl structure, the 2 and 6 positions are meta to each other. So, each ring has a nitro at 6 and a methyl ester group at 2. So, looking at each ring, the substituents are at 2 and 6.

But does the entire molecule have a plane of symmetry? Because the substituents on each ring are in the same positions, perhaps the molecule is symmetrical. So, I think this molecule is symmetrical and thus not chiral. So, compound 1 doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, unless the biphenyl structure allows for some kind of asymmetry. Alternatively, perhaps the arrangement of substituents leads to a chiral center. But in this case, the substituents on the biphenyl rings are at 2 and 6, which are meta to each other. So, each ring has the same substituents in the same positions, making the molecule symmetrical. So, no optical isomerism.

Compound 2: has a chiral center, so yes.

Compound 3: no chiral centers, so no.

Compound 4: no chiral centers, so no.

Wait, but I'm not sure about compound 4. Let me think again. Dimethyl fumarate is (E)-CH2CH(COOCH3)2, but wait, that's incorrect. Let me try to think about the actual structure again.

Wait, fumarate's structure is (E)-HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. When esterified with two methyl groups, each -OH becomes OCH3. So, the structure is (E)-OCH3OC-CH=CH-CO-OCH3.

Wait, but that's not correct. It should be (E)-CH2(COOCH3)-CH2(COOCH3), but no, that's not correct. Wait, the correct structure is O
                              ||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2–CH
      \
       C(=O)-OCH3

No, perhaps it's better to think of it as:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2–CH–C(=O)-OCH3

But that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2–CH
      \
       C(=O)-OCH3

Wait, but this doesn't quite make sense. Maybe I'm getting stuck here, but regardless, I think the key point is that the molecule doesn't have a chiral center, so it doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

So, the only compound that exhibits optical isomerism is compound 2.

Looking at the options:

Option A) 1, 2 and 4 → no, because 1 and 4 don't exhibit.

Option B) 3 and 4 → no.

Option C) 2 and 3 → no, because 3 doesn't.

Option D) 1 and 2 → no, because 1 doesn't.

Wait, but wait, what about compound 4? Did I make a mistake there?

Wait, dimethyl fumarate: perhaps it's a trans-diesters, but maybe it's a meso compound. If so, then it's achiral and doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

So, only compound 2 exhibits optical isomerism.

Wait, but the options don't have an option where only 2 is correct. Let me check the options again:

The options are:

A) 1, 2 and 4 → so 1, 2, 4 are correct.

B) 3 and 4 → no.

C) 2 and 3 → no.

D) 1 and 2 → no.

Wait, none of the options have only 2 correct. Did I make a mistake here?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating compound 1. Let me think again.

Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

The biphenyl rings have substituents at 2 and 6 positions on each ring. So, each ring has a nitro group at 6 and a methyl dicarboxylate group at 2. Are the substituents arranged in a way that makes the molecule symmetrical?

Let me visualize the biphenyl. Each ring has substituents at positions 2 and 6. So, the substituents are in the meta positions relative to each other. But when you have two rings connected, their substituents could be arranged in a way that allows for symmetry.

Wait, perhaps the molecule is symmetrical along the axis that goes through the central bond. So, if one ring has a nitro at 6, the other ring has a nitro at 6 as well, which would be in the same relative position as the first ring. So, perhaps the molecule is symmetrical, making it a meso compound. Therefore, no optical isomerism.

Hmm. So, only compound 2 exhibits optical isomerism. But looking back, the options don't have an option where only 2 is correct. Wait, let me check the options again.

The options are:

A) 1, 2 and 4 → so includes 1, which I thought doesn't have.

B) 3 and 4 → no.

C) 2 and 3 → no.

D) 1 and 2 → no.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with compound 4. Let me think again. Dimethyl fumarate: is there any possibility of a chiral center?

Wait, the structure is O
             ||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2–CH–C(=O)-OCH3

Wait, in this structure, each of the CH2 groups is connected to a COOCH3 group. No, I think that's not the case. Let me think of the correct structure again.

The correct structure of dimethyl fumarate is (E)-CH2=C(COOCH3)CH2COOCH3? No, I'm getting really stuck on this. Let me think of it as the ester of fumaric acid. Fumaric acid is (E)-HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. So, each -OH becomes OCH3. So, the structure is (E)-OCH3OC-CH=CH-CO-OCH3.

Wait, that's not correct. The correct structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2–CH–C(=O)-OCH3

No, perhaps the correct structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2–CH–C(=O)-OCH3

Wait, I'm confused, but perhaps another approach: the molecule has a double bond, and the two ester groups are on opposite sides (E configuration). So, does that create any stereogenic centers?

No, because each carbon in the double bond is attached to two identical groups. For example, each carbon in the double bond is connected to a CH2 group and an ester group. Wait, no, perhaps not.

Wait, in the (E) isomer, the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. So, each ester group is attached to a CH group, but the CH groups are connected to two ester groups each. So, each of those CH groups is connected to two ester groups and two CH2 groups. Therefore, each of those CH groups would have two identical substituents (the ester groups), so they can't be chiral centers.

Therefore, compound 4 doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Hmm. So, only compound 2 exhibits optical isomerism. But the options don't have an option where only 2 is correct. So, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating another compound.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with compound 1. Let me think again.

Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

Each benzene ring has substituents at positions 2 and 6. So, each ring has a nitro group at 6 and a methyl ester group at 2. So, considering the biphenyl structure, is there a plane of symmetry?

Let me imagine the biphenyl as two benzene rings connected by a single bond. If each ring has substituents at 2 and 6, then looking at the entire molecule, perhaps there's a plane of symmetry between the two rings, making the molecule achiral.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are arranged in a way that the molecule is not symmetrical. For example, if the substituents are in positions that prevent the molecule from having a plane of symmetry, leading to chirality.

Wait, but how? The substituents are in the same positions on each ring. So, each ring's substituents are in positions 2 and 6, which are meta to each other. So, if the rings are connected, and each has substituents in the same positions, then the molecule would be symmetrical, making it a meso compound and thus not chiral.

So, compound 1 doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Hmm, so I'm back to only compound 2.

But looking at the options given:

A) 1, 2 and 4 → no, because 1 and 4 don't.

B) 3 and 4 → no.

C) 2 and 3 → no.

D) 1 and 2 → no.

None of the options match the conclusion that only 2 is correct. So, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating another compound.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with compound 4. Let me think again. Is dimethyl fumarate chiral?

Wait, another approach: dimethyl fumarate is (E)-CH2CH(COOCH3)2. Wait, that would imply that the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. But in that case, the molecule is symmetrical, so it's not chiral.

Wait, but wait, the structure is actually O
                              ||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2–CH
      \
       C(=O)-OCH3

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is (E)-CH2=C(COOCH3)2. So, each of the double-bonded carbons has a COOCH3 group and a CH2 group.

Wait, if each of those carbons is connected to two COOCH3 groups and two CH2 groups, then they can't be chiral centers because they have two identical substituents.

Hmm. So, perhaps compound 4 doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, maybe I should consider that dimethyl fumarate is not a chiral molecule, so doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

So, back to the options, the only correct option is that only compound 2 exhibits optical isomerism. But the options don't have that. So, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating compound 4.

Wait, another angle: perhaps compound 4 has a chiral center elsewhere. Let me think: the molecule is dimethyl fumarate, which is (E)-CH2-CH(COOCH3)2.

Wait, no, perhaps the structure is (E)-CH2-COOCH3 and CH2-COOCH3 connected by a double bond.

Wait, perhaps the structure is (E)-CH2–COOCH3–CH2–COOCH3 with a double bond between the two CH2 groups? No, that can't be. Alternatively, it's (E)-CH2–CH–COOCH3 and another CH2–CH–COOCH3.

Wait, perhaps the structure is (E)-CH2-CH(COOCH3)–CH2-CH(COOCH3), but that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is (E)-CH2–COOCH3–CH2–COOCH3, but that's a single bond. I'm getting stuck again.

Wait, another approach: perhaps dimethyl fumarate has a central double bond with ester groups on each end. So, the structure is (E)-CH2–COOCH3–CH2–COOCH3 with a double bond between the two CH2 groups. So, the structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2.

In that case, each of the carbons in the double bond is connected to a CH2 and a COOCH3 group. So, each carbon has the same substituents, so they can't be chiral centers.

So, the molecule has no chiral centers, so no optical isomerism.

Thus, only compound 2 exhibits optical isomerism.

But looking at the options again:

A) 1, 2 and 4 → includes 1 and 4.

B) 3 and 4 → no.

C) 2 and 3 → no.

D) 1 and 2 → no.

Wait, none of the options match. So, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating compound 1. Let me think again.

Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

The substituents are at 2 and 6 on each ring. So, each ring has a nitro group at 6 and a methyl ester at 2. Are these positions such that the molecule is symmetrical?

In a biphenyl, the 2 and 6 positions are meta to each other. So, each ring has substituents at 2 and 6. The other ring has the same substituents. So, the molecule would have a plane of symmetry along the central bond, making it a meso compound. So, no optical isomerism.

Hmm. So, perhaps I made a mistake with compound 4. Maybe it has a chiral center I didn't notice.

Wait, another approach: perhaps dimethyl fumarate doesn't have a chiral center, but because of the double bond's configuration, it has geometric isomerism. But geometric isomerism is a type of stereoisomerism, not optical isomerism. So, the question is about optical isomerism, which requires enantiomers. So, that's separate from geometric isomerism.

So, even if compound 4 has geometric isomerism, it doesn't have optical isomerism because it doesn't have a chiral center.

Thus, the only compound that exhibits optical isomerism is compound 2. But none of the options show that. So, perhaps I made a mistake elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with compound 3. Let me think again: benzophenone is a symmetrical molecule, so no optical isomerism. Correct.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the answer is option A: 1, 2, and 4. But I thought 1 and 4 don't exhibit.

Wait, another approach: perhaps compound 1 does exhibit optical isomerism.

So, if the substituents on the biphenyl rings are arranged in a way that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, making it chiral.

Wait, for example, if the substituents are at positions that lead to a chiral center, but in a biphenyl, the rings themselves aren't chiral centers. So, perhaps the molecule is chiral because the substituents are arranged asymmetrically.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is not symmetrical, making it chiral. How?

Wait, each ring has substituents at 2 and 6, which are meta positions. So, for each ring, those substituents are in the same orientation relative to each other. But when connected to another ring, perhaps the overall molecule isn't symmetrical.

Wait, perhaps the molecule isn't symmetrical, leading to chirality.

Let me think: each ring has substituents at 2 and 6. Because the biphenyl can rotate around the central bond, perhaps the arrangement of substituents can lead to a lack of symmetry. But typically, for biphenyls with substituents in symmetrical positions, the compound is not chiral.

Wait, unless the substituents are in a way that creates a chiral arrangement. For example, if the substituents are in positions that can't be superimposed on their mirror image.

Wait, but in this case, each ring has a nitro group and a carboxylate group. So, perhaps the arrangement of these groups leads to a chiral arrangement.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral.

I'm getting stuck here. Let me think of it this way: if the substituents on each ring are arranged such that the molecule as a whole is symmetrical, then it's not chiral. If not, then it is.

In this compound, each ring has a nitro at 6 and a methyl ester at 2. So, looking from the top, the substituents on each ring are in the same positions. So, perhaps the molecule is symmetrical, making it not chiral.

So, conclusion: only compound 2 exhibits optical isomerism. But none of the options have that.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with compound 4. Let me think again: dimethyl fumarate.

Wait, another idea: perhaps the molecule has a chiral center elsewhere, not in the double bond.

Wait, the ester groups are attached to the double bond. So, perhaps the structure is such that there's a chiral center in the ester groups.

Wait, no, because the ester groups are in symmetrical positions. Each ester is attached to a CH2 group, which is connected to the double bond.

Wait, perhaps the central carbon in the ester group is a chiral center. For example, in the ester group, the carbon connected to the oxygen could have four different substituents.

But wait, the ester is O-C-OCH3, where the carbon is connected to O, OCH3, and two other groups.

Wait, perhaps the structure is such that the carbon next to the carbonyl group is a chiral center. For example, in the case of methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, the central carbon is a chiral center.

But in dimethyl fumarate, perhaps the carbons attached to the carbonyl groups are not chiral centers.

Wait, perhaps I should draw the structure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should conclude that only compound 2 exhibits optical isomerism, and the correct option is not present. But that's unlikely; perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should re-examine compound 4. Dimethyl fumarate is (E)-CH2-CH(COOCH3)2. So, each of the CH groups is connected to a COOCH3 and a CH2 group. So, each CH has two identical substituents (COOCH3 groups?), making them not chiral centers. Therefore, no chiral centers, so no optical isomerism.

Thus, the only compound that exhibits optical isomerism is compound 2.

Looking at the options again, the closest option is option A, which includes 1, 2, and 4. But I don't think that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake with compound 4. Maybe it's a diastereomer and exhibits geometric isomerism, but that's not optical isomerism.

Wait, perhaps I should look for another approach. The question is about which compounds show optical isomerism, which requires the presence of a chiral center or some other form of asymmetry leading to non-superimposable mirror images.

So, reviewing each compound once more:

1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate: possibly symmetrical → no optical isomerism.

2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: has a chiral center → yes.

3. benzophenone: no chiral centers → no.

4. dimethyl fumarate: no chiral centers → no.

Therefore, only compound 2 exhibits optical isomerism, but none of the options match. So, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating compound 1.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the biphenyl structure in compound 1 lacks a plane of symmetry, making it chiral.

In a biphenyl, if the substituents are in such a way that the molecule isn't symmetrical, it can be chiral. For example, if one substituent is on position 2 and another on position 3 on each ring, the molecule could be chiral.

But in this case, each ring has substituents at 2 and 6, which are meta. So, perhaps the molecule is symmetrical, making it not chiral.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Maybe I should proceed with what I think, even if the options don't seem to match.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option A: 1, 2, and 4. But I don't think 1 and 4 are correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake with compound 4 and it does have a chiral center.

Wait, another approach: the diesters of maleic acid are chiral. Wait, maleate is the cis diester, which is chiral, whereas fumarate is the trans diester, which is not chiral.

So, if compound 4 is dimethyl fumarate, which is the trans isomer, it's not chiral. So, no optical isomerism.

Therefore, the only correct answer is compound 2.

Looking back at the options, perhaps option A is incorrect, and the correct option isn't listed. But that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with compound 1. Let me think: perhaps the substitution pattern in compound 1 makes it not symmetrical. For example, the substituents might not be arranged symmetrically, leading to chirality.

In that case, compound 1 would exhibit optical isomerism.

If that's the case, then the correct option would be option A: 1, 2, and 4.

But I'm not confident about that. Another way: perhaps when the substituents are in the 2 and 6 positions on each ring of a biphenyl, the molecule is not symmetrical, making it chiral.

Wait, each ring has a nitro at 6 and a methyl ester at 2. So, when looking from the top, each ring has substituents in meta positions. But the biphenyl structure allows rotation, so perhaps the arrangement can lead to a lack of symmetry.

Wait, if the substituents are arranged in a way that their positions don't mirror each other across the central bond, then the molecule could be chiral.

But I'm not certain. I'm stuck, but given the time I've spent, I'll proceed with the conclusion that only compound 2 exhibits optical isomerism.

But since none of the options have that, perhaps the correct answer is option A (1, 2, 4) but I'm not confident.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think that compound 4 has a plane of symmetry, so it's not chiral. Thus, only 2.

But since the options don't have that, perhaps I should reevaluate.

Wait, perhaps in compound 1, the substituents are arranged in a way that the molecule is not symmetrical, making it chiral.

If that's the case, then compound 1 would exhibit optical isomerism, and so would compound 2.

But looking at the options, option D is 1 and 2. So, that would make option D the correct answer.

Wait, but I thought compound 1 was symmetrical. So, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should conclude that the correct answer is option A: 1, 2, and 4.

But given the time I've spent, I'll proceed to the answer.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine which compounds exhibit optical isomerism, we analyze each compound for the presence of a chiral center or a lack of symmetry that would allow for non-superimposable mirror images.

### Compound 1: Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate  
This compound consists of a biphenyl structure with substituents at the 2 and 6 positions on each ring. The molecule is symmetrical due to the identical substituents on each ring and the plane of symmetry along the central bond. Since it is achiral, it does not exhibit optical isomerism.

### Compound 2: Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate  
The structure of this compound is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. The central carbon (the second carbon) is attached to four different groups: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and the adjacent carbon. This makes it a chiral center, allowing the compound to exhibit optical isomerism.

### Compound 3: Benzophenone  
Benzophenone has the structure Ph-C(=O)-Ph, where two phenyl groups are attached to a carbonyl group. The central carbon is double-bonded to oxygen and symmetrically bonded to two identical phenyl groups. This symmetry makes the molecule achiral, and it does not exhibit optical isomerism.

### Compound 4: Dimethyl Fumarate  
Dimethyl fumarate is the diester of fumaric acid and has the structure (E)-CH2=C(COOCH3)2. The molecule is symmetric due to the identical substituents on either side of the double bond. While it exhibits geometric isomerism (cis/trans), it does not have a chiral center and is therefore not optically active.

### Conclusion  
Only **Compound 2** exhibits optical isomerism due to the presence of a chiral center. However, none of the provided options match this conclusion. Based on the analysis, the closest option is **A (1, 2, and 4)**, but this is incorrect as compounds 1 and 4 do not exhibit optical isomerism.
