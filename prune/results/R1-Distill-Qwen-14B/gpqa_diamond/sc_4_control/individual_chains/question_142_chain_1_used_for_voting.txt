Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. I'm a bit rusty on some of the concepts, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question presents a density matrix:

ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)

And asks about its geometrical position in the qubits space, giving four options for r as a vector.

Hmm, I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when dealing with mixed states. A pure state would be a density matrix that's a projector, like |ψ⟩⟨ψ|, but this looks a bit different. Let me think about what this matrix represents.

Wait, this ρ looks like it's an equal mixture of |0⟩ and |1⟩ states. Because when you take |0⟩⟨0|, that's a projector onto state 0, and similarly for |1⟩. So adding those two and then scaling by 1/2 makes it a mixed state with equal probabilities for 0 and 1. So it's a completely mixed state for a single qubit.

But the question is about its geometrical position. Oh right, in the Bloch sphere representation, any single-qubit state can be represented as a vector in 3D space. For pure states, the vector is on the surface of the sphere. For mixed states, like this one, I think it's at the origin.

Wait, no, what's the Bloch vector for a mixed state? Let me recall. The Bloch vector r is defined such that the density matrix can be written as (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices. So for a general state ρ:

ρ = (I + r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z ) / 2

If I can express the given ρ in that form, then I can find the components of r.

Let me compute ρ first. Let's write out |0⟩⟨0| and |1⟩⟨1| in matrix form. The basis states |0⟩ and |1⟩ are represented as column vectors [1; 0] and [0; 1], respectively.

So |0⟩⟨0| is a 2x2 matrix [[1,0],[0,0]], and |1⟩⟨1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. Adding these together gives [[1,0],[0,1]], which is the identity matrix I. So ρ is (1/2)(I) = I/2.

Wait, but wait. The density matrix of a completely mixed state is indeed I/2 for a single qubit. So now, let's see how to express ρ in terms of the Pauli matrices.

The Pauli matrices are:
σ_x = [[0,1],[1,0]]
σ_y = [[0,-i],[i,0]]
σ_z = [[1,0],[0,-1]]

So, I is the identity matrix, which can be written as σ_0. But when using the Bloch vector form, I is 2ρ when ρ is the mixed state. Let me re-express ρ.

We have ρ = I/2. So substituting into the Bloch form:

I/2 = (I + r·σ)/2

Multiply both sides by 2:

I = I + r·σ

Subtract I from both sides:

0 = r·σ

Which implies that r·σ = 0. The only vector r that satisfies this is r = 0. Because if you have a non-zero r, then r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z won't be zero.

So the components of r (r_x, r_y, r_z) must all be zero. Therefore, the geometric position is at the origin (0,0,0).

Looking at the options, option C is r=(0,0,0). So the answer should be C.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Another approach: the Bloch vector for a mixed state is the expectation value of the Pauli matrices scaled by 2. So for a state ρ, the components of r are 2⟨σ_i⟩, where ⟨σ_i⟩ is the expectation value of σ_i in the state.

But since ρ is I/2, let's compute ⟨σ_x⟩ = Tr(ρ σ_x). ρ is I/2, so Tr( (I/2) σ_x ) = (Tr(σ_x))/2. But σ_x is a traceless matrix, so Tr(σ_x)=0. Similarly, for σ_y and σ_z, their traces are zero. So each ⟨σ_i⟩ is zero, so r is zero.

Yes, that confirms it. The correct answer is option C.

The given density matrix is:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents a completely mixed state for a single qubit, where the system has equal probabilities of being in states \(|0\rangle\) and \(|1\rangle\). In the Bloch sphere representation, the state of a qubit can be described by a vector \(\mathbf{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z)\), where the density matrix can be expressed as:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} \right),
\]

with \(\boldsymbol{\sigma}\) being the Pauli matrices. For the given \(\rho\), we can rewrite it as:

\[
\rho = \frac{I}{2}.
\]

Substituting this into the Bloch form:

\[
\frac{I}{2} = \frac{1}{2} \left( I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} \right).
\]

Multiplying through by 2 and simplifying:

\[
I = I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}.
\]

Subtracting \(I\) from both sides:

\[
\mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} = 0.
\]

The only solution to this equation is \(\mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0)\), meaning the state is at the origin of the Bloch sphere. This confirms that the geometrical position of the density matrix in qubit space is at the origin.
