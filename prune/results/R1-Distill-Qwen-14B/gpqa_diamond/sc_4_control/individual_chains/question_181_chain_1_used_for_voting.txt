Okay, so I've got this question about neutrino flux from the Sun, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it. Let me read the question again.

The question says that the pp-III branch in the Sun's core suddenly stopped about 8 and a half minutes ago, but all other reactions continued as usual. We need to find the ratio of the flux between two energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). The options are A) 10, B) 0.01, C) 1, D) 0.1.

First, I remember that the pp chain is a series of reactions in the Sun's core that produces energy. The pp-III branch is a specific part of this chain. Oh wait, the pp chain has several branches, like pp-I, pp-II, and pp-III. Each branch contributes differently to neutrino production, I think.

Neutrinos are produced in various reactions. The main ones are the proton-proton (pp) chain and the Carbon-Nitrogen-Oxygen (CNO) cycle. The pp chain is the dominant process in the Sun, so it's probably the main source of neutrinos.

The pp chain produces electron neutrinos (ν_e) mainly. The pp-I branch produces a lot of neutrinos, right? Like, the main reaction in pp-I is 2 protons → deuterium + positron + ν_e. The pp-II and pp-III branches are side reactions that occur when there's a higher density or temperature, I think.

Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact details. I remember that the pp-III branch involves reactions that produce higher-energy neutrinos. Because when the protons go through different reactions, the byproducts might have different energies.

In the pp-III branch, one of the reactions might be something like the fusion of two protons into helium-3, which later fuses into helium-4. But wait, no, the pp-I branch is the standard one, and pp-II and pp-III are the other branches. So maybe the pp-III branch produces higher-energy neutrinos than the pp-I branch.

If the pp-III branch stops, then the production of neutrinos from that branch would stop. But the other processes, like the pp-I branch and the CNO cycle, might continue.

Wait, the question says that all other reactions remain as they were. So the CNO cycle is unaffected, and the pp-I branch continues, but the pp-III branch stops.

So, before the pp-III branch stopped, the Sun was producing neutrinos from both pp-I, pp-II, and pp-III. Now, with pp-III stopped, only pp-I and pp-II (and whatever other processes) continue.

Wait, but I think the pp-II branch is a minor contributor. The main neutrino flux comes from the pp-I branch and the CNO cycle. Oh, but the CNO cycle produces ν_e as well, but at a lower rate compared to the pp chain.

But in typical solar neutrino production, the majority of the neutrinos come from the pp chain, with a smaller contribution from the CNO cycle. So if the pp-III branch stops, which contribution are we losing?

Let me think about the neutrino energies. The pp-I branch produces lower-energy neutrinos because when a proton converts into a neutron, it emits a lower-energy ν_e. The pp-III branch might produce higher-energy neutrinos because the reactions involve more energy.

So if pp-III stops, the flux of higher-energy neutrinos (like those in band 2, 800-900 keV) would decrease, while the lower-energy ones (700-800 keV) are mainly from pp-I and CNO.

Wait, but the CNO cycle's neutrinos are lower energy as well. The CNO cycle produces neutrinos with energies around a few tens of keV, I think. So the main higher-energy neutrinos come from the pp chain.

In the pp-I branch, the neutrinos have energies up to around 400 keV, maybe? I'm not very sure. Or maybe the pp-I branch produces neutrinos with lower energies, and the pp-II and pp-III produce higher. So if the pp-III branch is stopped, the high-energy neutrinos (800-900 keV) would be less.

Wait, but wait. The question is about the flux in two bands: 700-800 and 800-900. So band 1 is lower than band 2.

In the normal Sun, the flux in each band depends on the number of neutrinos emitted in that energy range. If the pp-III branch contributes more to higher energies, then stopping it would reduce the higher-energy flux.

So before stopping, both bands would have some contribution from pp-III. But after stopping, the higher band (800-900) would lose that contribution, but the lower band (700-800) would still get contributions from pp-I and CNO.

If the pp-III is a significant source of high-energy neutrinos, then the flux in band 2 would drop more than band 1. So the ratio of band 1 to band 2 would increase.

But what's the typical distribution of solar neutrinos by energy?

I remember that most solar neutrinos have energies around 100s of keV or less. The highest energy neutrinos are from the pp chain, specifically the reactions in the pp-III branch.

Wait, but what's the typical energy spectrum? The pp-I branch produces neutrinos with energies up to about 400 keV, and the pp-III branch produces higher, maybe up to 700-800 keV or more? Or perhaps the energies are even higher.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III branch produces neutrinos in the 500-800 keV range, and the CNO cycle produces lower. So if the pp-III stops, the flux in 700-800 would drop, as well as the higher bands.

But in this question, the bands are 700-800 and 800-900. So band 1 is 700-800, band 2 is 800-900.

If the pp-III branch is responsible for neutrinos in band 2, then stopping it would mean that the flux in band 2 drops, but band 1 might still have some contribution from other sources, like pp-I or CNO.

Wait, but the CNO cycle's neutrinos are lower energy, so maybe they don't contribute much to band 1. So if the pp-III is the main source for band 2, then flux in band 2 would drop to almost zero, while band 1 would drop only if pp-III contributed there.

Alternatively, maybe the pp-III produces neutrinos in a higher energy range, beyond 800 keV. So the flux in band 2 would be significantly reduced.

Wait, let me think about the pp chain again. The main pp-I reaction is p + p → 2H + e+ + ν_e. The neutrino energy is about 0.42 MeV (like 420 keV), right? So that's around 400 keV, which would fall into band 1 (700-800? No, wait, 400 is below band 1. So maybe the neutrinos from pp-I are lower than 700 keV. Hmm, so band 1 is 700-800, band 2 is 800-900.

Wait, so the pp-I neutrinos are around 400 keV, so they wouldn't contribute to either band. Then how do the higher bands get their neutrinos?

I must have messed something up. Let me think again.

No, wait—the pp chain has several steps. The first step produces a ν_e with energy about 0.42 MeV (420 keV), but that's the main contributor. But wait, are there other steps in the pp chain that produce higher-energy neutrinos?

Yes, the pp-II and pp-III branches. The pp-II branch involves capturing a proton on ²H (deuterium) to form ³H (tritium), which then decays, emitting a ν_e. The energy of the neutrino from this reaction is around 16 keV. So that's much lower.

The pp-III branch might involve reactions that produce higher-energy neutrinos. For example, another possible reaction is the capture of a proton on a ³He nucleus to form ⁴He, which might emit a ν_e with higher energy.

Wait, I think the pp-III branch involves the reaction ³He + p → ⁴He + e+ + ν_e. The energy of the emitted neutrino can be higher than the standard 420 keV from the pp-I branch. So the neutrinos from the pp-III branch are more energetic, perhaps in the 500-800 keV range or higher.

So if the pp-III branch is stopped, the flux of high-energy neutrinos (like above 400 keV) would drop. So the neutrinos in band 1 (700-800) and band 2 (800-900) are mainly from the pp-III branch. If the pp-III stops, then the flux in both bands would decrease.

But how much? If the pp-III branch was the main contributor to the higher bands, then the flux in band 2 would drop more than band 1, because the pp-III might produce more in higher energies.

Wait, but maybe the pp-III neutrinos have a distribution that peaks at higher energies. So the flux in band 2 (800-900) would be more affected than band 1 (700-800). So the ratio of band 1 to band 2 flux would increase.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III branch produces a larger number of neutrinos in band 2 than in band 1. So when it stops, band 2 flux drops more than band 1, making the ratio band1/band2 higher.

Wait, but without knowing the exact energy distribution, it's a bit tricky. Let's think about the total contribution of the pp branches.

The pp-I branch is the main contributor to the solar neutrino flux. The pp-II and pp-III are minor compared to pp-I. So if pp-III stops, the total solar neutrino flux would drop, but only the higher-energy part.

So the neutrinos below, say, 400 keV are from pp-I and CNO. The neutrinos above 400 keV are from pp-III.

Wait, but the pp-III neutrinos would be from the reactions in that branch. So if pp-III stops, then the neutrinos in the 700-800 and 800-900 keV bands would be much lower.

But how much lower?

Let me think about the percentages. Suppose the pp chain contributes about 99% of the solar neutrinos, with the pp-I branch being the majority, and pp-II and pp-III being smaller.

If the pp-III branch contributes a small fraction, say 1% of the total neutrinos, then stopping it would reduce the high-energy neutrinos significantly but the lower-energy ones (bands 1 and 2) would still have their main sources (pp-I and pp-II, and CNO). Wait, but earlier I thought that the neutrinos from pp-III are higher in energy.

Alternatively, maybe the pp-III branch is a minor contributor, so when it stops, the high-energy bands (like 800-900) would have a larger decrease in flux compared to band 1 (700-800), which might have a smaller decrease.

Wait, but if the pp-III neutrinos are in the 800-900 keV range, then band 2 would lose all its contribution, while band 1 would lose some but maybe not all.

Let me imagine the neutrino flux as a function of energy. The main peak is around 400 keV (from pp-I), then there's a smaller peak or a tail from pp-III at higher energies.

If pp-III is stopped, the tail (higher energies) would drop. So the flux in band 2 (800-900) would be much lower than before, but band 1 (700-800) would also be lower but perhaps not as much.

So the ratio would be band1_flux / band2_flux. If band1 was previously X and band2 was Y, after pp-III stops, band1 becomes X - a (where a is the contribution from pp-III), and band2 becomes Y - b (b is the contribution from pp-III for that band).

But without exact numbers, it's hard. However, I remember that the majority of solar neutrinos have energies around 200-400 keV, with a tail extending to higher energies. The pp-III branch contributes significantly to the high-energy tail.

So if pp-III is stopped, the high-energy tail (band 2) would drop, but the lower part of the tail (band 1) might still have some contribution from other sources, though I'm not sure.

Wait, no—the CNO cycle produces neutrinos with lower energies, around tens of keV. So the neutrinos in bands 1 and 2 are mainly from the pp chain.

So if the pp-III is stopped, which mainly affects higher energies, the flux in band 2 would decrease more than band 1. Let's say band 2's flux was 10% from pp-III, and band 1 was 5% from pp-III.

Then after stopping, band 2's flux drops by 10%, and band 1's drops by 5%. But perhaps it's more that the pp-III contributes more to the higher end.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III neutrinos are the majority of the flux in band 2. So their flux was, say, 90% of band 2, and only 10% of band 1.

If that's the case, then after stopping, band2_flux would be 0.1 times the original (assuming pp-III contributed 90% of band2), and band1_flux would be 0.9 times original (if pp-III contributed 10% to band1).

So the original ratio was (band1)/(band2) = (0.9)/(0.1) = 9. After stopping, the new ratio would be (0.9)/(0.1) = 9? Wait, no, because if band1's contribution was 10% from pp-III, then the rest is from pp-I and CNO. So perhaps band1's flux is X, and band2's is Y. If Y is mainly from pp-III, then after stopping, Y becomes Y - Y_ppIII. Similarly, band1's becomes X - X_ppIII.

Assuming X_ppIII is much less than Y_ppIII. Let's say X_ppIII is 10% and Y_ppIII is 90%. So band1 was 90 (90% from pp-I and CNO) + 10 (10% from pp-III) = 100. Band2 was 10 (10% from others) + 90 (90% from pp-III) = 100.

After stopping, band1 becomes 90 (others) + 0 (pp-III) = 90. Band2 becomes 10 (others) +0 =10.

So the ratio is 90/10=9. So the ratio increases from 1 to 9.

But the options are 10, 0.01, 1, 0.1. So the ratio would be 9, approximately, which is close to option A (10) or C (1). Hmm, but this is a hypothetical scenario, so perhaps the actual numbers are different.

Wait, but in reality, the pp-III neutrinos are a small fraction of the total. Wait, no, the pp-III is a minor branch compared to pp-I, but the neutrinos from it are high-energy.

So the pp-III branch produces fewer neutrinos, but each has higher energy. So the number of high-energy neutrinos is less than the total number of neutrinos but a significant fraction of the high-energy flux.

Therefore, if pp-III is stopped, the high-energy bands (like 800-900) would have a lower flux, but the lower bands (like 700-800) would lose a smaller fraction of their neutrinos.

So the ratio of band1 over band2 would be higher than before.

Wait, before the stop, perhaps the ratio was roughly 1. After the stop, the ratio increases because band2 loses more flux.

In the example I thought of earlier, the ratio went from 1 to 9 when pp-III stops, which would be a 9 times increase. But the options don't have 9. The closest option is A) 10.

Alternatively, perhaps in reality, the pp-III contributes about 1/10th of the neutrinos in band1 and about 9/10th in band2.

Wait, that's not possible. Because if the pp-III neutrinos are higher energy, they would be in band2 and not in band1. So maybe the pp-III neutrinos are primarily in band2, with a small part in band1.

So when pp-III stops, band2's flux drops a lot, but band1's flux only drops a little.

Let me say that originally, band1's flux was F1 = F_pp1 + F_pp2 + F_pp3 + F_CNO. Similarly, band2's flux F2 = F_pp3 + F_pp2 (if any) + F_CNO.

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Let me think in terms of percentages.

Suppose that before the pp-III stopped:

- Band1 (700-800) receives 90% of its neutrinos from pp-I and CNO, and 10% from pp-III.

- Band2 (800-900) receives 95% from pp-III and 5% from others.

So F1 = 90 (others) + 10 (pp-III) = 100.

F2 = 5 (others) + 95 (pp-III) = 100.

The ratio F1/F2 is 100/100=1.

After pp-III stops:

F1 = 90 (others) + 0 (pp-III) =90.

F2=5 (others) +0 (pp-III) =5.

So the new ratio is 90/5=18. So that's higher than 1.

But the options don't have 18. Hmm.

But in reality, the pp-III might contribute more significantly to the higher bands. For instance, perhaps 95% of band2 and 5% of band1.

If that's the case, after stopping:

F1= 95 (others) +5 (pp-III)=100? No, wait, no—assuming the others are 5% in band1, and 5% in band2.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the neutrino spectrum.

The neutrino flux as a function of energy has a peak around 0.4 MeV (400 keV). The flux decreases as energy increases beyond that, but there's a tail from higher-energy neutrinos.

The pp-III branch produces neutrinos in the higher-energy part of this tail. So before stopping, the high-energy bands (like 800-900 keV) get a significant contribution from pp-III.

After stopping, the flux in band2 drops significantly, while band1 (700-800) loses some, but perhaps not as much.

Let's say the original flux in band1 was 100 units, with 90 from pp-I and CNO and 10 from pp-III.

Band2 had 100 units, with 90 from pp-III and 10 from others.

After pp-III stops:

Band1: 90 units.

Band2: 10 units.

Ratio =90/10=9.

So the ratio increases by a factor of 9. So the options are 10, 0.01, 1, 0.1.

Since 9 is close to 10 (option A), but I'm not sure if the actual ratio would be about 10.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III neutrinos are more towards the higher end, so band2's flux drops more, making the ratio (F1/F2) increase.

But perhaps another angle: the pp-III branch contributes more neutrinos to band2 than band1. So if it stops, F2 drops more, making F1/F2 larger.

Another approach: think about the energy ranges and the pp-III neutrinos.

The pp-III neutrinos have energies higher than the main pp-I neutrinos. So the main pp-I neutrinos are around 400 keV, which is in band1 (700-800? No, it's below 700). So the pp-III must contribute to neutrinos above 400 keV.

Wait, 400 keV is 0.4 MeV. So the pp-III neutrinos are in the 0.5-0.9 MeV (500-900 keV) range.

So band1 is 0.7-0.8 MeV (700-800 keV), band2 is 0.8-0.9 MeV (800-900 keV).

So the pp-III neutrinos are the main contributors to both band1 and band2.

If the pp-III stops, then the flux in both bands would drop.

But how much?

If the pp-III neutrinos make up, say, 50% of band1 and 90% of band2, then the ratio after stopping would be (0.5F1)/(0.1 F2) = (0.5/0.1) * (F1/F2 before). Wait, no, because F1 and F2 were originally F1 = F_ppI + F_ppIII, etc.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Perhaps an easier way is to think about the approximate energy distribution of solar neutrinos.

The majority of solar neutrinos have energies around 200-400 keV, with a decreasing number above that. The pp-III branch produces a small number of high-energy neutrinos, but those are the only ones above ~500 keV.

So before the pp-III stops, the neutrino flux in band1 is a mix of lower-energy neutrinos from pp-I and higher-energy from pp-III. Similarly, band2 is mainly from pp-III.

After pp-III stops, the high-energy part (band2) would lose all its contribution, while band1 would still have some from pp-I.

But wait, the pp-I neutrinos are around 400 keV, which is in the 400-700 keV range. So they would contribute to the 400-700 keV band, not band1 (700-800 keV). Hmm, no, wait, 700 keV is 0.7 MeV. So the pp-I neutrinos are at 0.42 MeV, which is in the lower part.

So the neutrinos in band1 (700-800) are from pp-III, and perhaps a small part from other reactions. Similarly, band2 is from pp-III.

So if pp-III stops, the flux in both bands would drop, but the higher band (band2) would drop more.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Maybe the pp-III neutrinos have a wider energy distribution, so some fall into band1 and some into band2.

If the flux in band1 was 90 from pp-III and 10 from others, and band2 was 95 from pp-III and 5 from others.

After stopping, band1 becomes 10, band2 becomes 5. So the ratio is 10/5=2.

But none of the options are 2.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III neutrinos peak at higher energies, so band2 is mostly from pp-III, and band1 has a small contribution.

After pp-III stops, band2's flux drops to (say) 5, and band1 is 10. So the ratio is 10/5=2.

But again, the options don't have 2.

Wait, perhaps the neutrinos in band1 are 90% from pp-III and 10% from others. Band2 is 95% from pp-III and 5% from others.

After stopping, band1 is 10%, band2 is 5%.

Ratio 10/5=2.

Hmm, but the options don't have 2.

Wait, perhaps the pp-III neutrinos are the only ones contributing to the 800-900 keV band. So, if they stop, band2's flux drops to zero, but band1's flux remains the same.

Wait, no. If the pp-III neutrinos are the only ones in band2, then after stopping, band2 has zero. But band1 might have some from other sources.

But the CNO neutrinos are typically lower energy, so perhaps they don't contribute to band1 either.

Alternatively, perhaps other branches like pp-I or pp-II contribute to band1.

Wait, the pp-I neutrinos are at 420 keV, which is below 700 keV, so they don't contribute to band1. So the neutrinos in band1 (700-800) must come from pp-III.

So if pp-III stops, band1's flux would also drop. But perhaps the pp-III neutrinos have a broader energy distribution, so some are in band1 and some in band2.

Assuming that, the flux in band1 is, say, 80% from pp-III and 20% from others (like maybe some other minor sources or perhaps some higher-energy pp-I neutrinos? I'm not sure). Similarly, band2 is 90% from pp-III and 10% from others.

After stopping, band1's flux would drop to 20% of original, and band2 drops to 10% of original.

So the ratio would be (0.2)/(0.1)=2.

But the options don't have 2. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the pp-III neutrinos are the main contributors to both band1 and band2.

If the original ratio of F1 to F2 is approximately 1 (so the same number of neutrinos in each band), then after stopping, F1 drops to a fraction and F2 drops more, making the ratio F1/F2 higher.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio is initially 1, and after stopping, F2 drops more, making F1/F2 higher.

But without exact numbers, it's challenging.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III neutrinos contribute more to band2 than band1. So the ratio F1/F2 would be higher after the stop.

Wait, let's think about the neutrino energy spectrum. The flux decreases with increasing energy. So band1 (700-800) is lower energy than band2 (800-900), so the flux in band1 is higher than in band2.

Wait, no. Because the flux decreases with energy, the number of neutrinos in higher energy bands is lower. So band1 (700-800 keV) would have more neutrinos than band2 (800-900 keV).

Wait, that's correct. Because the neutrino spectrum is a decreasing function of energy. So F1 (700-800) has higher flux than F2 (800-900).

So the original ratio F1/F2 is greater than 1. How much?

If the neutrino flux drops by a factor of 10 between 700 and 900 keV, then F1 is 10 times F2. So the ratio would be 10.

But if the pp-III branch is stopped, the high-energy part is affected more.

Wait, but if the pp-III neutrinos are the only contributors to band2, then after stopping, band2's flux drops to zero, while band1's flux remains as before (assuming band1 is mostly from pp-III as well).

Wait, but if the pp-III neutrinos are the only contributors to both bands, then stopping them would set both F1 and F2 to zero. But that's not the case because the CNO cycle and other branches may contribute.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III neutrinos are the main contributors to band1 and band2. So when they stop, the flux in both drops, but band1's flux was higher.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III neutrinos contribute 90% of band1 and 95% of band2.

Before stopping:

F1 = 90 (pp-III) + 10 (others) = 100.

F2 = 95 (pp-III) +5 (others)=100.

Ratio F1/F2=1.

After stopping:

F1=10 (others).

F2=5 (others).

Ratio = 10/5=2.

But the options don't include 2. So perhaps the answer is C) 1, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but if the pp-III is stopped, and it contributes to both bands, but the higher band (band2) is more sensitive, the ratio could stay the same or change.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio remains approximately 1.

Wait, but I'm not getting anywhere. Let's think about the options.

The options are A)10, B)0.01, C)1, D)0.1.

The question is asking for the flux ratio F1/F2, where F1 is 700-800 and F2 is 800-900.

If the pp-III branch is stopped, and it mainly affects the higher energies, then F2 would decrease more than F1.

So the ratio F1/F2 would increase.

Looking at the options, the only option where F1/F2 is greater than 1 is A)10 and C)1.

If the ratio was initially around 1, and after stopping, it becomes 10, then the answer would be A.

But I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III neutrinos are the only ones in band2, and contribute significantly to band1.

So, if F1 was 100 and F2 was 100, and after stopping, F1 is 90 and F2 is 10, the ratio becomes 9.

But the options don't have 9; the closest is A)10.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III neutrinos are all in band2, making F2 zero after stopping, while F1 remains the same. Then the ratio F1/F2 would be undefined (infinite), which isn't an option.

But that's not possible, because some neutrinos would still be in band1 from other sources.

Wait, but what if the pp-III neutrinos are the main contributors to band1 and the only contributors to band2.

So, before stopping: F1 = 90 (pp-III) + 10 (others) =100.

F2= 100 (all from pp-III).

After stopping: F1=10 (others), F2=0.

Ratio is 10/0, which is undefined. But that's not an option.

Hmm, perhaps the pp-III neutrinos are not the sole contributors to band2. Maybe the pp-I or other processes contribute a small amount.

In reality, the main pp chain is pp-I, which produces neutrinos around 400 keV, which is below band1.

But the pp-III branch produces higher-energy neutrinos, perhaps in band1 and band2.

So, perhaps without pp-III, the flux in both bands would drop, but since the flux decreases with energy, the higher band (band2) would drop more, making F1/F2 higher.

If the original ratio was 1 (same number of neutrinos in each band), but after stopping, F1 is 0.9 and F2 is 0.1, the ratio becomes 9, which is closest to option A)10.

Alternatively, maybe the original ratio was about 1, and after stopping, it's about 10, leading to option A.

But I'm not confident. Another approach: the pp-III neutrinos are a minor part of the total neutrino flux. So their stopping would have a minor impact on the total, but a major impact on high-energy bands.

So the flux in band2 would drop a lot, but the flux in band1 would drop less. So the ratio F1/F2 would increase.

If the original ratio was about 1, and after stopping, it's about 10, then the answer is A.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio remains approximately 1, making the answer C.

But I'm not certain. Another thought: since the pp-III is stopped, but the other sources (pp-I and CNO) continue, the neutrinos in band1 and band2 would come from those.

But the CNO cycle neutrinos are at lower energies, so they don't contribute to band1 or band2. So band1 and band2 would primarily lose their pp-III contributions.

So without pp-III, band1 and band2 would have almost no neutrinos. But that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps the pp-I neutrinos are around 400 keV, so they don't contribute to band1. The pp-III neutrinos are the main contributors to band1 and band2. So stopping pp-III would almost eliminate the flux in both bands.

But without pp-III, the flux in both bands would be almost zero, but the ratio would depend on other sources, which may be negligible.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the total flux.

The total solar neutrino flux is dominated by the pp chain. The pp-III is a minor branch but contributes to higher-energy neutrinos.

The neutrino flux as a function of energy is a smoothly decreasing function, with a peak around 400 keV. So the flux in band1 (700-800) is lower than the flux below 400 keV but higher than band2.

If the pp-III neutrinos are responsible for the tail at higher energies, then stopping pp-III would mainly affect band2, making its flux much lower than band1.

Thus, the ratio F1/F2 would be higher than 1.

Looking at the options, A is 10, which is higher than 1. So perhaps the answer is A.

But I'm not entirely confident. Another way: in the solar model, the contribution of the pp-III branch to the neutrino flux is relatively small compared to the pp-I branch. So if pp-III stops, the flux in the higher bands would drop, but the majority of neutrinos come from pp-I, so the lower bands would remain mostly unaffected.

Wait, but pp-I produces neutrinos around 400 keV, which is below band1 (700-800). So band1 is in a region where pp-III is the main contributor.

So if pp-III stops, band1's flux would drop a lot, and band2's flux would drop even more.

Wait, that's conflicting. If pp-III is the main contributor to band1 and band2, then after stopping, both drop.

But in reality, the number of neutrinos in band2 is less than band1 because the flux decreases with energy.

So, perhaps the ratio F1/F2 is originally around 5 (since the flux drops by a factor of about 5 between 700 and 900 keV), but without exact data, it's hard.

In any case, the question is about the ratio after the pp-III branch stops. The answer options suggest that the ratio is either 10, 0.01, 1, or 0.1.

I think the correct answer is C)1, because the pp-III neutrinos don't significantly affect the ratio between these two bands. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III neutrinos contribute about the same amount to both bands, so their stopping would leave the ratio approximately unchanged.

But I'm not convinced. Another angle: the pp-III neutrinos are higher energy, so they're more in band2 than band1. So when pp-III stops, band2's flux drops more, making F1/F2 higher.

If the original ratio was about 1, and after stopping, F1 is 90 and F2 is 10, the ratio is 9, which is about 10 (option A).

So I think the correct answer is A)10.

The question involves determining the ratio of neutrino flux between two energy bands, 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2), after the pp-III branch in the Sun's core hypothetically stops. The pp-III branch is a minor but significant contributor to high-energy neutrinos, primarily affecting the higher-energy tail of the neutrino spectrum. The pp-I branch, which dominates neutrino production, emits lower-energy neutrinos around 400 keV, and the CNO cycle contributes even lower-energy neutrinos, typically below 100 keV.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Energy Distribution of Solar Neutrinos**:
   - The majority of solar neutrinos are produced by the pp-I branch and have energies around 400 keV, falling below band 1 (700-800 keV).
   - The pp-III branch produces higher-energy neutrinos, contributing significantly to the flux in band 1 and band 2 (800-900 keV).
   - The flux decreases with increasing energy, meaning band 1 (700-800 keV) typically has a higher flux than band 2 (800-900 keV).

2. **Impact of Stopping the pp-III Branch**:
   - The pp-III branch is the primary contributor to high-energy neutrinos, particularly in band 2 (800-900 keV). Stopping it would significantly reduce the flux in band 2.
   - Band 1 (700-800 keV) also receives some contribution from the pp-III branch, but the reduction would be less severe compared to band 2.

3. **Flux Ratio Before and After the pp-III Branch Stops**:
   - Before stopping, the flux in band 1 and band 2 would have a certain ratio, influenced by the contributions from the pp-III branch.
   - After stopping, the flux in band 2 drops more dramatically than in band 1, increasing the ratio of band 1 flux to band 2 flux.

4. **Approximation and Options**:
   - If the pp-III branch contributes significantly to band 2, the flux in band 2 could drop to a small fraction of its original value, while band 1 retains a larger fraction of its original flux.
   - This would result in a higher ratio of band 1 flux to band 2 flux. Among the given options, the closest match to this scenario is **10**.

### Conclusion:
The stopping of the pp-III branch would disproportionately affect the higher-energy band (800-900 keV), leading to a significant increase in the flux ratio between band 1 (700-800 keV) and band 2 (800-900 keV). The most reasonable approximation for this ratio is **10**.
