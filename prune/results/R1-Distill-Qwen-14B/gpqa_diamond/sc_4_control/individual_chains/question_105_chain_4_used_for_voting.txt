Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about a star with some dark spots and how the brightness variations compare to an exoplanet's signal. I've heard that when a planet transits in front of a star, it blocks some light, causing a dip in brightness, which we can detect. But in this case, the star has spots, and the brightness variation is similar to a planet's effect. Interesting.

The star's radius is the same as the Sun's, so Rstar = R_sun. The spots are on one hemisphere with a filling factor of 20%, which I think means that 20% of that hemisphere is covered by spots. Each spot is cooler by 1000K, since the temperature difference is 1000K. The star's effective temperature is 6000K, so the spots are at 5000K. 

The problem says that the observed brightness variations are periodic because the star is rotating, so the spots come into and out of view as it spins. But without the spots, what planet radius would cause the same dip in brightness?

Wait, the key is to find Rpl/Rstar such that the light curve amplitude (the change in brightness) is the same whether it's due to a planet transiting or due to the spots rotating into view.

So I need to model both scenarios: the star with spots and a planet transiting the star. Compute the brightness variation in each case and set them equal, then solve for Rpl/Rstar.

Let me think about each case.

First, the star with spots. The star's total brightness when spots are on one hemisphere. Since the star rotates, when a spot is on the visible side, it contributes less brightness because it's cooler. But because only one hemisphere is spotty, maybe spots are on the front half, and the other hemisphere is normal.

Wait, the filling factor is 20% for one hemisphere. So each hemisphere has an area, and 20% of that area is covered in spots. So for each hemisphere, area is 2πR^2 (since a hemisphere is half the sphere), but wait, no. Wait, the star's surface area is 4πR², so each hemisphere is 2πR². The spots cover 20% of that, so 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR².

Wait no, wait. The problem says one hemisphere is covered with a filling factor of 20%. So each hemisphere is 2π R². The filling factor is the fraction of that hemisphere covered by spots. So each spot covers 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R²?

Wait, no, perhaps. Wait, filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere. So the area of the hemisphere is 2π R². 20% of that is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R². So the total area covered by spots is 0.4 π R².

But the star's total surface area is 4π R². So the spots cover 0.4 π R² / 4π R² = 0.1 or 10% of the entire star's surface. Wait, but since it's only one hemisphere, I think the 20% is for that hemisphere. So when the star rotates, the visible hemisphere changes. When the spotty hemisphere is facing us, the spots are on that side. So when the star rotates, the spots come into view and then go away.

So the brightness variation would be the difference when the spots are on the side we see versus when they're not.

Wait, let me model the brightness when the star is showing the spotty hemisphere. The brightness is the sum of the normal regions and the spotted regions.

The star's total luminosity without any spots would be L = 4π R² σ T_eff^4. But with spots, when a hemisphere is visible, part of it is cooler.

Wait, but the star is rotating such that the spotty hemisphere is visible to us for part of the rotation period. So, when the spotty hemisphere is visible, the total brightness would be the sum of the normal part and the spotted part.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to model the observed brightness as a function of the rotation. Let me think of the star as having two regions: one hemisphere (A) is spotty (20% coverage) and the other is normal (hemisphere B). When the star rotates, sometimes we see hemisphere A, sometimes B.

Wait, but the problem states that only one hemisphere is spotty. So when the star is viewed from Earth, when the spotty hemisphere is facing us, we see the spots. Otherwise, we don't.

Wait, no. The star is a sphere, so when it rotates, the spots come into view and then go away. But the star's rotation period would cause the brightness variation as the spots rotate in and out of view.

Wait, perhaps the variation in brightness is due to the spots being in the visible hemisphere. When the star is rotating, the spots go from being on the day side (visible) to the night side (not visible). So when the star is viewed such that the spotty hemisphere is facing us, the spots contribute less brightness. 

But I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to compute the brightness variation.

The star's total surface area is 4π R². The spotty hemisphere has 20% coverage, so 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R² is spotted. The rest is normal. So the cool spots have an area of 0.4 π R².

The star's total luminosity (without any spots) would be L = 4π R² σ (6000)^4. When spots are present, the spots contribute less. When the spotty hemisphere is facing us, the brightness will be lower.

Wait, but how much lower? Let's compute the average brightness when the spots are present.

The total brightness when the spotty hemisphere is visible: when the star is viewed from Earth, the visible hemisphere is the spotty one. So the area we see is 2π R², of which 0.2 fraction is spots, so 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R² is spots, and the rest is normal. 

So the brightness when the spotty hemisphere is visible is:

L_spotty = (normal area * T_eff^4 + spot area * (T_eff - 1000)^4) / (4π R²) * 4π R².

Wait, no. The total luminosity is the sum of all the surface elements. So for the spotty hemisphere, the normal part is 0.8 * 2π R², and the spotted part is 0.2 * 2π R². So the luminosity from the visible hemisphere is:

L_visible = (0.8 * 2π R²) * σ (6000)^4 + (0.2 * 2π R²) * σ (5000)^4.

The total star's luminosity when the spotty hemisphere is facing us is this L_visible. But when the star is not showing the spotty side, the visible hemisphere is all normal, so L_normal_visible = 2π R² * σ (6000)^4.

Wait, but the star's rotation makes different parts of the surface visible. So when the star is rotating, the brightness varies between L_visible (when the spotty side is visible) and L_normal_visible (when the other side is visible)?

Wait, no, because the entire star is rotating. So when the spotty hemisphere is facing us, the star's brightness is L_visible, and when it's the other hemisphere (non-spotty), the brightness is 2π R² * σ (6000)^4.

Wait, but the spotty hemisphere is only on one side. So during the rotation, when the spot hemisphere is visible, part of the visible surface is cooler. So the brightness variation is between maximum (when all visible hemisphere is normal) and lower (when some is spotted).

Wait, no. The star's surface is made up of two hemispheres: one with 20% spots, the other without. So when the star rotates, one hemisphere becomes the visible one. When the spotty hemisphere is visible, the luminosity is L_visible = (0.8 * 2π R² * σ (6000)^4 ) + (0.2 * 2π R² * σ (5000)^4 ). When the other hemisphere is visible (normal), L is 2π R² * σ (6000)^4.

But wait, the star's total luminosity is L = 4π R² σ (6000)^4 * (0.8 * 2π R² / 4π R²) ??? No, perhaps not. Alternatively, the star's overall luminosity when the spots are present is the sum of the spotted and non-spotted parts. So when the star is viewed as a whole, the total luminosity depends on which hemisphere is visible.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model the brightness variation as the star rotates. So the star has a certain brightness when the spotty hemisphere is visible, and a higher brightness when the non-spotty hemisphere is visible. The variation in brightness would be the difference between these two states.

But the star is rotating, so the brightness would vary as the spots come into view. So the maximum brightness is when the non-spotty hemisphere is facing us, and the minimum when the spotty one is.

Wait, no, because the spotty hemisphere is only on one side. So when the star is viewed from Earth, as it rotates, if the spotty hemisphere is on the far side, we don't see the spots. But as it rotates, the spots come into view. So the brightness would dip as the spots become visible.

Wait, perhaps the brightness variation is the difference between when the spots are in the field of view and when they're not.

So the amplitude of the brightness variation due to the spots is the difference between the all-normal brightness and the brightness when some spots are visible.

Let me compute the brightness when the spotty hemisphere is visible.

The visible area is 2π R². Of that, 20% is spots (0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R²) and 80% is normal (0.8 * 2π R² = 1.6 π R²).

So the brightness when the spotty hemisphere is visible is:

L1 = [ (1.6 π R²) * (6000)^4 + (0.4 π R²) * (5000)^4 ] * σ / (4π R²) * 4π R².

Wait, wait, no. Let me think differently. The total luminosity from the star when the spotty side is visible is the sum of the two regions.

The luminosity without any spots is L0 = 4π R² σ (6000)^4.

When the spotty hemisphere is visible, the observed luminosity is L1 = (normal area fraction * T_eff^4) + (spot area fraction * T_spot^4).

Wait, the fraction of the star's surface that's normal when the spotty hemisphere is visible is [ (2π R² - 0.4 π R²) ] / (4π R²) )? No, because when the spotty hemisphere is visible, the area we see is 2π R², of which 0.4 π R² is spots.

Alternatively, the fraction of the star's surface that's visible is 2π R², and within that, 0.2 is spots.

So the emitted flux (per unit area) when the spotty hemisphere is visible is:

F1 = [ (0.8 * 6000^4) + (0.2 * 5000^4) ] * σ.

The total luminosity when the spotty hemisphere is visible is F1 * 2π R².

Wait, no. Wait, the star's total flux is the sum of all surface elements. So when the spotty hemisphere is visible, the flux is:

F_spotty_visible = (0.8 * (6000)^4 + 0.2 * (5000)^4) * σ.

But since the star's surface area is 4π R², the total luminosity when the spotty hemisphere is visible is F_spotty_visible * (2π R²) / (4π R²) ) * 4π R²? Wait, maybe not.

Wait, no. The total luminosity is the sum of all the flux from the visible hemisphere and the invisible hemisphere. Wait, no, because the star's rotation makes only one hemisphere visible at any time. So when the spotty hemisphere is visible, the total flux is from that hemisphere. The other hemisphere is not visible, so its flux doesn't contribute.

Wait, no. The star emits in all directions, but when one hemisphere is visible, the other is on the far side and its flux doesn't reach us. So the observed flux is only from the visible hemisphere.

So, when the spotty hemisphere is visible, the flux is:

F_spotty = (0.8 * 6000^4 + 0.2 *5000^4) * σ * (2π R²) / (4π R²) ) * 4π R²? Hmm, I'm getting a bit tangled here.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute the relative brightness variation.

The star's total luminosity without any spots is L0 = 4π R² σ (6000)^4.

When the spotty hemisphere is visible, the luminosity is L1 = (2π R²) * [ (0.8 * (6000)^4) + (0.2 * (5000)^4) ] * σ.

Because the visible area is 2π R², with 0.8 fraction normal and 0.2 fraction spots.

So L1 = 2π R² σ [ 0.8*(6000)^4 + 0.2*(5000)^4 ].

The average brightness when the star is viewed from Earth would alternate between L1 (when the spotty hemisphere is visible) and L0/2 (when the other hemisphere is visible, which is all normal. Wait, no: Wait, when the non-spotty hemisphere is visible, its area is 2π R², all at Teff. So L_non-spotty = 2π R² σ (6000)^4.

Wait a minute, so when the star is rotating, the brightness alternates between L1 and L2, where L2 is 2π R² σ (6000)^4.

The average brightness would be the average of L1 and L2 over time. So the peak brightness is L2, and the minimum is L1.

Wait, but wait: the star's total luminosity without any spots is L0 = 4π R² σ (6000)^4. But when the star is showing the spotty hemisphere, only 2π R² is visible, so the observed flux is only from that area. So the total flux from the star when the spotty hemisphere is visible is F_spotty = (0.8 * (6000^4) + 0.2 * (5000^4)) * (2π R²) * σ.

Similarly, when the other hemisphere is visible, F_non-spotty = (6000^4) * (2π R²) * σ.

So the amplitude of the brightness variation is (F_non-spotty - F_spotty) / F_non_spotty.

Wait, no: because when the spotty hemisphere is visible, the flux is lower, so the brightness variation would be F_non-spotty - F_spotty.

The relative amplitude (delta F / F) would be (F_non-spotty - F_spotty) / F_non-spotty.

So let's compute that.

Compute F_non-spotty:

F_non-spotty = 2π R² σ (6000)^4.

Compute F_spotty:

F_spotty = 2π R² σ [0.8 * (6000)^4 + 0.2 * (5000)^4 ].

So delta F = F_non-spotty - F_spotty.

delta F = 2π R² σ (6000)^4 - 2π R² σ [0.8*(6000)^4 + 0.2*(5000)^4 ]

= 2π R² σ [ (6000)^4 - 0.8*(6000)^4 - 0.2*(5000)^4 ]

= 2π R² σ [ 0.2*(6000)^4 - 0.2*(5000)^4 ]

= 0.2 * 2π R² σ [ (6000^4) - (5000^4) ]

So delta F / F_non-spotty = [ 0.2 * 2π R² σ (6000^4 -5000^4) ] / [ 2π R² σ (6000^4) ) ]

Simplify:

= 0.2 * (6000^4 -5000^4) / (6000^4 )

= 0.2 * [ (6000^4)/(6000^4) - (5000^4)/(6000^4) ) ]

= 0.2 [ 1 - (5/6)^4 ]

Compute (5/6)^4: 5^4 = 625, 6^4=1296. 625/1296 ≈ 0.482253.

So 1 - 0.482253 ≈ 0.517747.

Multiply by 0.2: 0.2 * 0.517747 ≈ 0.10355.

So delta F / F ≈ 10.355% .

Wait, but wait: that's the amplitude when the star shows the spotty hemisphere. So the brightness variation is about a 10.35% dip when the spots are visible.

Now, the same amplitude should be produced by a planet transiting the star.

When a planet transits the star, the dip in brightness is (Area of planet / Area of star) * (T_planet^4 / T_star^4) ? No, wait. When a planet transits, it blocks some of the star's light. The dip in brightness is simply the ratio of the planet's area to the star's area. Because the planet is much cooler, but for the purpose of the dip, it just blocks the starlight. So the dip is (R_planet^2 / R_star^2).

Wait, but actually, the dip is (R_planet / R_star)^2, because the area is proportional to the square of the radius.

Wait, but in this problem, the star is the same as the Sun. So R_star = R_sun. The planet's radius is R_planet, so the dip in brightness is (R_planet / R_sun)^2.

But in our case, the dip due to the planet would be (R_planet/R_star)^2.

Set this equal to the dip from the spots, which we found to be approximately 0.10355 (or 10.35%).

So:

(R_planet/R_star)^2 = 0.10355

Take square root:

R_planet / R_star = sqrt(0.10355) ≈ 0.3218.

So R_planet ≈ 0.32 R_star.

Looking at the options, option D is ~0.32.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation. The dip from the planet is (R_planet/R_star)^2. The dip from the spots is about 0.10355. So R_planet/R_star ≈ sqrt(0.10355) ≈ 0.3218, which is approximately 0.32. So the correct answer is D) ~0.32.

But wait a second, did I make a mistake in the dip calculation? Because when the planet transits, it blocks part of the star's light regardless of the star's temperature. So the dip is simply (R_planet^2 / R_star^2) * 100%.

Wait, no, that's correct. Because the planet only blocks a part of the star's disk. So the change in flux is (R_p / R_s)^2.

In the case of the star with spots, the dip is 10.35%, and for the planet, the dip is (R_p/R_s)^2. Setting them equal, we get (R_p/R_s)^2 = 0.10355 → R_p/R_s ≈ 0.3218.

So the answer should be D) ~0.32.

Wait, but wait. I think I made a mistake in the spot calculation. Let me recheck.

I calculated delta F / F as 10.35%, but perhaps I should have considered the entire star's luminosity when the spots are present. Wait, because the star's total luminosity when the spotty hemisphere is visible is less than when the other hemisphere is visible.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the average brightness. The star is rotating, so the brightness alternates between two states: maximum (when the non-spotty hemisphere is visible) and minimum (when the spotty hemisphere is visible).

The average brightness is (L_max + L_min)/2.

But wait, perhaps the star's overall brightness is just the sum of the two hemispheres. No, because when you can only see one hemisphere at a time.

Wait, perhaps the maximum brightness is when the non-spotty hemisphere is visible. The minimum is when the spotty hemisphere is visible.

So the amplitude is (L_max - L_min)/L_max.

Wait, let me recompute.

Compute L_non-spotty: when the non-spotty hemisphere is visible, the flux is F_non-spotty = 2π R² σ (6000)^4.

Compute L_spotty: when the spotty hemisphere is visible, the flux is F_spotty = 2π R² σ [0.8*(6000)^4 + 0.2*(5000)^4 ].

So the peak brightness is F_non-spotty, and the minimum is F_spotty.

The amplitude is (F_non-spotty - F_spotty) / F_non-spotty.

Which is:

[ F_non - F_spotty ] / F_non = [ (1 - (0.8*(6000^4) + 0.2*(5000^4))/ (6000^4) ) ] * (2π R² σ) )

So,

= [1 - (0.8 + 0.2 * (5000^4)/(6000^4) ) ] 

= [1 - 0.8 - 0.2*(5/6)^4 ]

= [0.2 - 0.2*(5/6)^4 ]

= 0.2 [1 - (5/6)^4 ]

As before, (5/6)^4 ≈ 0.482253.

So,

0.2 [1 - 0.482253] = 0.2 * 0.517747 ≈ 0.10355.

So the amplitude is around 10.35%, same as before.

So the planet's dip should be the same, 10.35%. So R_p / R_s = sqrt(0.10355) ≈ 0.3218.

Looking at the options, D is ~0.32. So the correct answer is D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet relative to the host star that would produce the same brightness variation as the observed star with dark spots, we analyze the two scenarios: the star with spots and a planet transiting the star.

### Key Parameters:
- **Star's Radius**: \( R_{\text{star}} = R_{\odot} \) (same as the Sun).
- **Star's Effective Temperature**: \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \).
- **Spots' Temperature**: \( T_{\text{spot}} = 5000 \, \text{K} \).
- **Filling Factor of Spots**: \( 20\% \) of one hemisphere is covered by spots.

### Brightness Variation Due to Spots:
The star's total surface area is \( 4\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \). Since only one hemisphere is spotty, the visible hemisphere alternates between the spotty and normal hemispheres as the star rotates. The brightness variation arises from the difference in luminosity between these two states.

1. **Maximum Brightness**: When the non-spotty hemisphere is visible, the flux is:
   \[
   F_{\text{non-spotty}} = 2\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \sigma (6000)^4
   \]
   where \( \sigma \) is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.

2. **Minimum Brightness**: When the spotty hemisphere is visible, the flux is:
   \[
   F_{\text{spotty}} = 2\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \sigma \left[ 0.8 \cdot (6000)^4 + 0.2 \cdot (5000)^4 \right]
   \]

3. **Amplitude of Brightness Variation**:
   The amplitude is the relative change in brightness between the maximum and minimum states:
   \[
   \text{Amplitude} = \frac{F_{\text{non-spotty}} - F_{\text{spotty}}}{F_{\text{non-spotty}}}
   \]
   Substituting the expressions for \( F_{\text{non-spotty}} \) and \( F_{\text{spotty}} \):
   \[
   \text{Amplitude} = 1 - \frac{0.8 \cdot (6000)^4 + 0.2 \cdot (5000)^4}{(6000)^4}
   \]
   Simplify:
   \[
   \text{Amplitude} = 1 - \left[ 0.8 + 0.2 \cdot \left( \frac{5000}{6000} \right)^4 \right]
   \]
   Compute \( \left( \frac{5000}{6000} \right)^4 \):
   \[
   \left( \frac{5}{6} \right)^4 \approx 0.482253
   \]
   Substitute:
   \[
   \text{Amplitude} = 1 - \left[ 0.8 + 0.2 \cdot 0.482253 \right] = 1 - \left[ 0.8 + 0.09645 \right] = 1 - 0.89645 = 0.10355
   \]
   Thus, the amplitude is approximately \( 10.35\% \).

### Brightness Variation Due to a Planet:
When a planet transits the star, the dip in brightness is proportional to the area of the planet relative to the star:
\[
\text{Dip} = \left( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2
\]
To match the amplitude of \( 10.35\% \), we set:
\[
\left( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2 = 0.10355
\]
Solve for \( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \):
\[
\frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} = \sqrt{0.10355} \approx 0.3218
\]

### Conclusion:
The radius of the hypothetical exoplanet relative to the host star is approximately \( 0.32 \). This corresponds to option **D**.

**Answer: D**
