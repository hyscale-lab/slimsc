Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius 2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, so this is a two-dimensional metric, right? Because it's in terms of dx and dy. So the space described here is a 2D surface with this metric.

I remember that for surfaces, the area element can be found using the determinant of the metric tensor. The metric tensor g here is diagonal because the off-diagonal terms (like dx dy) are zero. So the determinant would be just the product of the diagonal components. Wait, actually, the area element dA is sqrt(g) dx dy, where g is the determinant of the metric tensor.

The metric tensor g_ij is a matrix where g_xx = 32/(4 - x² - y²), g_yy = same, and the off-diagonals are zero. So the determinant g is (32/(4 - x² - y²))². So the area element would be sqrt(g) dx dy, which is (32/(4 - x² - y²)) dx dy.

But wait, the question is about the area of the pseudosphere. Pseudosphere... Oh right, a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature. The metric given probably describes such a surface.

Wait, I'm trying to recall. The metric for a pseudosphere (which is a model of hyperbolic geometry) usually has a form like ds² = dr² + (a² / cosh(r/a)^2) dθ², but I'm not sure. Alternatively, in some coordinate systems, especially isothermal coordinates, the metric can look different.

Alternatively, perhaps this is a metric in conformal form. Because it looks like f(x,y)^2 (dx² + dy²), where f is a function. Conformal metrics are easier to integrate because the area element is just f² dx dy.

So in this case, f(x,y) = sqrt(32/(4 -x² - y²)). So the area element is (32/(4 - x² - y²)) dx dy.

But wait, the coordinates x and y must be such that the denominator is positive, right? So 4 - x² - y² > 0. So the domain of x and y is the circle where x² + y² < 4. Oh wait, that's radius 2, so the domain is a disk of radius 2 in the x-y plane.

Wait, but that's just the coordinate system. The actual surface is a pseudosphere, which is a model of hyperbolic space. So the area we're integrating over is the entire pseudosphere, but using these coordinates, which cover a certain part of it.

Wait, maybe I should think about the Gaussian curvature. The area of a surface with constant curvature K is related to the Euler characteristic via the Gauss-Bonnet theorem. But wait, for a pseudosphere, which is non-compact, the Euler characteristic is zero. So maybe the area is infinite?

Wait, but the options include +infty as option D. So perhaps that's the answer.

Alternatively, perhaps the metric given is for a sphere. Because if the denominator is (4 - x² - y²), that's similar to the metric of a sphere of radius 2. Wait, on a sphere, the area is 4πr², so 4π*2²=16π. But the options don't have that. Oh, wait, the options have 4π(x² + y²), but that's not a number. So maybe I'm on the wrong track.

Wait, let me think again. The metric is conformally flat, as I thought. The area element is 32/(4 - x² - y²) dx dy. So to find the total area, I would integrate this over the domain where the denominator is positive, which is x² + y² <4.

So the area should be the double integral over x² + y² <4 of [32/(4 - x² - y²)] dx dy.

Let me switch to polar coordinates because the domain is a circle. So x= r cosθ, y= r sinθ, dx dy = r dr dθ.

So the integral becomes ∫ (θ=0 to 2π) ∫ (r=0 to 2) [32/(4 - r²)] * r dr dθ.

Factor out the 32 and the 2π:

32 * 2π ∫ (r=0 to 2) [ r / (4 - r²) ] dr.

Let me compute that integral. Let u=4 - r², du= -2r dr. So when r=0, u=4; r=2, u=0.

So ∫ [r/(4 - r²)] dr from 0 to 2 is ∫ (-1/2) du/u from 4 to 0. Because u=4-r², du= -2r dr → (-1/2) du = r dr.

So the integral becomes (-1/2) ∫ (from u=4 to u=0) (1/u) du.

Which is (-1/2) [ ln(u) ] from 4 to 0.

Wait, ln(u) at u=0 is negative infinity, but wait, the integral goes from 4 down to 0, so the limits are from 4 to 0. So ∫ (4 to 0) (1/u) du is ln(0) - ln(4) = -∞ - ln4. But multiplied by (-1/2), so (-1/2)(-∞ - ln4) = (1/2)(∞ + ln4) → ∞.

So the integral diverges. So the area is infinite. So the total area would be 32 * 2π * [divergent integral], which is infinite.

So the answer is D) +infty.

The given metric is 

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left(dx^2 + dy^2\right),
\]

which describes a two-dimensional surface in conformal coordinates. The area element for this metric is derived from the determinant of the metric tensor, which in conformal coordinates is proportional to the square of the conformal factor. Here, the area element is 

\[
dA = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \, dx \, dy.
\]

To find the total area of the pseudosphere, we integrate this area element over the domain where the metric is defined, which is the region \(x^2 + y^2 < 4\). Switching to polar coordinates (\(x = r \cos\theta\), \(y = r \sin\theta\)) simplifies the integration:

\[
A = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^2 \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \cdot r \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

The angular integral \(\int_0^{2\pi} d\theta = 2\pi\) can be factored out, leaving:

\[
A = 32 \cdot 2\pi \int_0^2 \frac{r}{4 - r^2} \, dr.
\]

To evaluate the radial integral, let \(u = 4 - r^2\), so \(du = -2r \, dr\). The limits of integration change as follows: when \(r = 0\), \(u = 4\), and when \(r = 2\), \(u = 0\). Substituting, the integral becomes:

\[
\int_0^2 \frac{r}{4 - r^2} \, dr = -\frac{1}{2} \int_4^0 \frac{1}{u} \, du = -\frac{1}{2} \left[\ln(u)\right]_4^0.
\]

As \(u \to 0\), \(\ln(u) \to -\infty\), so the integral diverges to infinity. This indicates that the total area of the pseudosphere is infinite.

Thus, the correct answer is:
