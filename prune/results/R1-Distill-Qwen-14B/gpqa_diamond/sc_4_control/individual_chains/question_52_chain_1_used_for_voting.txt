Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to break it down step by step. Let me read the question carefully.

So, the problem is about a star with certain characteristics. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. When it's not covered by dark spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, its overall photospheric Teff drops to 5500 K. 

Then, the question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2). The observed ratio decreases when the star has spots. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does. The transition corresponds to a wavelength of ~1448 Å, and we assume LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium) holds.

Hmm. So, first, I need to recall some basic principles about stars and atomic transitions. Oh right, in LTE, the distribution of atoms in different energy levels is governed by the Boltzmann equation. The ratio of populations (n1/n2) depends on the temperatures and the energy difference between the levels.

The Boltzmann equation states that the ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels is given by:

n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

Where:
- g1 and g2 are the statistical weights of the levels,
- E2 and E1 are the energies of the levels (with E2 > E1),
- k is the Boltzmann constant,
- T is the temperature.

Wait, but wait. In this problem, when the spots are present, the overall Teff is lower. But the spots themselves are cooler than the surrounding photosphere. So, when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the average Teff of the entire photosphere is 5500 K. But perhaps the spots are at a lower temperature, which affects the observed spectrum.

Wait, but the question says that in the stellar photosphere, when looking at the ratio of Ti neutral atoms in two levels, the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So, the entire photosphere's effective temperature is lower, but perhaps the spots are even cooler. But the problem seems to consider the observed ratio as a function of the overall photospheric temperature.

Wait, no. Because the star as a whole has a lower Teff when spots are present. So the effective temperature is 5500 K when spots are covering 40% of the surface. So, when the star is spotted, the overall photospheric temperature considered here is 5500 K. So, this Teff is the average of the unspotted and spotted regions.

Wait, but isn't the effective temperature of the entire star a combination of the unspotted and spotted areas? Oh, right, because spots are cooler, so when part of the surface is covered by spots, the observed flux (and thus Teff) is lower.

But the question is about the photospheric effective temperature. So when the star is spotted, the overall Teff is 5500 K, which is the average of the two regions. So, perhaps the unspotted regions are at 6000 K, and when 40% is spotted, the overall Teff is 5500 K. Hmm, but I might not need that for this specific problem because the question is about the ratio in the photosphere when the star has spots versus when it doesn't.

Wait, but no. The problem is about the ratio of Ti atoms in two energy levels in the photosphere when the star has spots versus when it doesn't. So, perhaps when the star has spots, the average temperature of the photosphere is 5500 K. So, the effective temperature of the photosphere when spotted is 5500 K, and when not, it's 6000 K.

Wait, but the transition in question is for Ti atoms in the photosphere. So when the star has a lower overall Teff, each point in the photosphere is either at 6000 K (unspotted regions) or cooler (the spots). But no, perhaps the 5500 K is an average, so perhaps the photospheric temperature is a mix of the two. However, for the purpose of the Boltzmann factor, perhaps we need to consider the effective temperature of the star as a whole, or maybe each region contributes to the line formation.

But the question says that the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So, the ratio is n1/n2 when the star is spotted is lower than when it isn't. Since n1/n2 depends on exp(-ΔE/(k T)), a lower T would make the ratio smaller. Because if T decreases, the exponential term becomes smaller.

Wait, let me think. The ratio n1/n2 is proportional to exp( - (E2-E1)/(k T) ). So as T decreases, the exponent becomes more negative, making the ratio smaller. So when the star has spots, T is lower, so the ratio n1/n2 is lower. Which fits with the observation.

So the ratio when spotted (T=5500 K) is lower than when not spotted (T=6000 K). So the question is, what's the factor by which the ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots (T=6000) compared to when it does (T=5500). So the factor is (n1/n2)_6000 / (n1/n2)_5500 = [ (g1/g2) exp(-ΔE/(k*6000)) ] / [ (g1/g2) exp(-ΔE/(k*5500)) ) ].

The g1/g2 terms cancel out, so the factor is exp[ (ΔE/(k)) (1/5500 - 1/6000) ) ].

Wait, let me compute that. Let me compute the exponent:

(ΔE/(k)) * (1/5500 - 1/6000) = (ΔE / k) * [ (6000 - 5500) / (5500*6000) ) ].

= (ΔE / k) * (500) / (3,300,000) )

= (ΔE / k) * (1/6600).

Wait, but wait, let me compute the difference 1/5500 - 1/6000. Let me compute:

1/5500 ≈ 0.0001818..., 1/6000 ≈ 0.000166666..., so the difference is approximately 0.0000152.

So, 1/5500 - 1/6000 = (6000 - 5500)/(5500*6000) ) = 500 / (3,300,000) ) = 5/(33,000) ) ≈ 1.515e-5.

So, the exponent becomes (ΔE/(k)) * (1.515e-5).

But I think I need to find the ratio of the ratios. So, the factor is exp( (ΔE/(k)) [ (1/5500) - (1/6000) ] ) ).

Alternatively, let me compute the exponent as (ΔE/(k)) * (1/T2 - 1/T1 ), where T2 is 5500 K and T1 is 6000 K? No, wait, because when T increases, the exponent becomes less negative, so the ratio increases. So the factor is the ratio when T is higher (6000) over when T is lower (5500). So the ratio when not spotted is higher than when spotted, which is why the ratio decreases when the star is spotted.

Wait, but in the problem statement, when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So the factor is (n1/n2)_6000 / (n1/n2)_5500 = factor. So it's the ratio when no spots compared to when spots are present.

So, to compute the factor, let me note that:

Factor = exp( [ (E2-E1)/(k) ] (1/(5500) - 1/(6000) ) )

Wait, because in the Boltzmann equation, the exponent is - (E2 - E1)/(k T), so when T is larger, the exponent is less negative, making the ratio n1/n2 larger.

So the ratio when T is 6000 is higher than when T is 5500. So the factor is (n1/n2 at 6000)/(n1/n2 at 5500) = exp( [ (E2-E1)/(k) ] (1/5500 - 1/6000) )

Wait, because when you take the ratio of the two ratios:

(n1/n2)_6000 / (n1/n2)_5500 = [exp( -ΔE/(k*6000) ) ] / [ exp( -ΔE/(k*5500) ) ] = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/5500 - 1/6000) )

Because:

exp(a) / exp(b) = exp(a - b), so:

-ΔE/(k*6000)  - [ -ΔE/(k*5500) ] = ΔE/(k) (1/5500 - 1/6000 )

Yes.

Now, I need to compute this exponent. But wait, I don't know ΔE. However, the transition corresponds to a wavelength of 1448 Å. Which is approximately 1448 Angstroms, which is 144.8 nm, which is in the ultraviolet range. 

So, the energy difference between the two levels can be found using the relation E = hc/λ. Because E = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant, c is speed of light.

So, ΔE = hc / λ.

Let me compute that. Let me remember the constants:

h = 6.62607015e-34 J·s

c = 2.99792458e8 m/s

λ = 1448 Å = 1448e-10 m (since 1 Å = 1e-10 m)

So, ΔE = (6.626e-34 J·s)(2.998e8 m/s) / (1448e-10 m)

Let me compute the numerator first: 6.626e-34 * 2.998e8 ≈ 1.986e-25 J·m.

Now, divide by λ = 1448e-10 m: 1.986e-25 / 1448e-10 = ?

1.986 / 1448 ≈ approx 1.37e-3 (since 1448 * 1.37 ≈ 1990, but wait, 1448 * 1.37 would be about 1990, but 1.986 is about 1.986, so 1.986/1448 ≈ 0.001372, which is 1.372e-3.

So, 1.372e-3 * 1e10 (because denominator is 1e-10 m, so 1/(1e-10) is 1e10). Wait, let me correct that.

Wait, 6.626e-34 * 2.998e8 = 6.626e-34 * 3e8 ≈ 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Then, divide by 1448e-10 m:

(1.9878e-25 J·m) / (1448e-10 m) = (1.9878e-25) / (1.448e-7) ) J.

Because 1448e-10 = 1.448e-7 m.

So, 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 ≈ (1.9878 / 1.448) )e-18 ≈ approximately 1.372e-18 J.

So, ΔE ≈ 1.372e-18 J per photon.

But wait, in terms of energy per particle, that's correct. Now, I need to calculate ΔE/(k), where k is Boltzmann's constant.

k = 1.380649e-23 J/K.

So, ΔE/(k) = (1.372e-18 J) / (1.3806e-23 J/K) ≈ (1.372 / 1.3806) )e5 K.

1.372 / 1.3806 ≈ 0.994.

So, approximately 0.994e5 K ≈ 9.94e4 K.

Wait, so ΔE/(k) ≈ 9.94e4 K.

Hmm, that's a very large value. Let me double-check the calculations.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute using more precise numbers.

Let me compute it step by step.

Compute hc:

h = 6.62607015e-34 J·s

c = 2.99792458e8 m/s.

hc = 6.62607015e-34 * 2.99792458e8 = let's compute:

6.62607015 * 2.99792458 ≈ approx 6.626 * 3 ≈ 19.878, but more accurately:

6.62607015 * 2.99792458:

= 6 * 2.99792458 = 17.98754748

0.62607015 * 2.99792458 ≈ approx 1.875 (since 0.6 * 3 is 1.8, plus a bit).

So total hc ≈ 19.86254748e-26? Wait, wait, the exponents: 1e-34 * 1e8 = 1e-26.

So hc = approx 1.98625e-25 J·m.

Then, λ = 1448e-10 m = 1.448e-7 m.

So, E = hc/λ = (1.98625e-25 J·m) / (1.448e-7 m) = (1.98625 / 1.448) )e-18 J.

1.98625 / 1.448 ≈ approx 1.372, so E ≈ 1.372e-18 J per photon.

Now, k = 1.380649e-23 J/K.

So, E/(k) = (1.372e-18) / (1.380649e-23) ) ≈ 1.372 / 1.380649 ) * 1e5.

1.372 / 1.380649 ≈ 0.994, so E/(k) ≈ 0.994e5 K ≈ 9.94e4 K.

So, about 99,400 K.

Wait, but wait. Let me compute E/(k) more accurately.

1.372e-18 J / 1.380649e-23 J/K = (1.372 / 1.380649 ) * (1e5) K.

1.372 / 1.380649 ≈ 0.994.

So, 0.994 * 1e5 = 99,400 K.

So, ΔE/(k) ≈ 99,400 K.

Now, I'll compute the exponent:

ΔE/(k) * (1/5500 - 1/6000 )

We already calculated (1/5500 -1/6000 ) ≈ 1.515e-5.

So,

Exponent = 99,400 K * 1.515e-5 1/K.

Compute that:

99,400 * 1.515e-5 = (99,400 * 1.515 ) * 1e-5.

Compute 99,400 * 1.515:

Well, 100,000 * 1.515 = 151,500, but since it's 99,400, which is 0.994 times 100,000.

So 0.994 * 151,500 ≈ 150,731.

Then, multiply by 1e-5: 150,731 * 1e-5 = 1.50731.

So the exponent is approximately 1.507.

So, the factor is exp(1.507) ≈ e^1.507.

We know that e^1 = 2.718, e^1.5 ≈ 4.4817.

What's e^1.507?

Wait, 1.507 is 1.5 + 0.007.

e^1.5 = 4.4817.

e^0.007 ≈ 1 + 0.007 + (0.007^2)/2 ≈ 1.00700245.

So, e^1.507 ≈ 4.4817 * 1.00700245 ≈ 4.4817 * 1.007 ≈ 4.4817 + (4.4817 *0.007) ≈ 4.4817 + 0.03137 ≈ 4.513.

So, the factor is approximately 4.51.

Looking at the options, option C is ~4.5. So the factor is about 4.5.

Wait, but wait. Did I make any mistake in calculating the exponent?

Let me double-check the exponent calculation.

Exponent = (ΔE/k) * (1/5500 - 1/6000) 

We have (ΔE/k) = 99400 K.

(1/5500 -1/6000) = (6000 -5500)/(5500*6000) ) = 500/(33,000,000) ) = (5e2)/(3.3e7) )= 5/(33000) )= 1/6600 ≈ 1.515e-4? Wait, because 500/(33,000,000) is 5e2/(3.3e7) = 5/(3.3e4) )= 5/(33000) )= 0.000151515, which is 1.515e-4.

Wait, earlier I thought 1/(5500) -1/(6000) = approx 0.0001818 -0.000166666 = 0.00001515, which is 1.515e-5.

Wait, so which is correct? Let me recalculate 1/5500 and 1/6000.

1/5500 = 0.000181818...

1/6000 = 0.000166666...

Subtract: 0.000181818 - 0.000166666 = 0.000015152.

So, 1.5152e-5.

Earlier, I thought (1/5500 -1/6000) is 1.515e-5.

So in that case, exponent = 99400 * 1.5152e-5 = ?

Wait, 99400 * 1.5152e-5 = (99400 * 1.5152) * 1e-5.

Compute 99400 * 1.5152:

Let me compute 100,000 * 1.5152 = 151,520.

But since it's 99400, which is 0.994 * 100,000.

So, 0.994 * 151,520 = approximately 151,520 * 0.994.

Compute 151,520 * 0.994 = 151,520 - (151,520 * 0.006) = 151,520 - 909.12 = approx 150,610.88.

So, 99400 * 1.5152e-5 = 150,610.88 * 1e-5 = 15.061088.

Wait, wait, wait. Oh, wait, no! I think I made a mistake here.

Wait, no! Because 99400 * 1.5152e-5 equals 99400 * 1.5152 * 1e-5.

Wait, 99400 is 9.94e4.

So, 9.94e4 * 1.5152e-5 = (9.94 * 1.5152) ) * (e4 * e-5 ) ) = (about 15.06) * (e-1) ) = 1.506.

Wait, that makes more sense. Because (9.94e4) * (1.5152e-5) = 9.94 *1.5152e-1.

9.94 *1.5152 ≈ 15.06, then e-1 → 1.506.

So, the exponent is 1.506, so factor is exp(1.506) ≈ e^1.506.

We know that e^1.5 is about 4.4817 as above.

What about e^1.506?

Well, 1.506 is 1.5 + 0.006.

So, e^1.5 = 4.4817.

e^0.006 ≈ 1 + 0.006 + (0.006)^2/2 ≈ 1 + 0.006 + 0.000018 ≈ 1.006018.

So, e^1.506 ≈ 4.4817 * 1.006018 ≈ 4.4817 * 1.006 ≈ 4.4817 + (4.4817 *0.006) ≈ 4.4817 + 0.0269 ≈ 4.5086.

So, approximately 4.5.

Therefore, the factor is about 4.5.

Looking back at the options, option C is ~4.5. So the answer should be C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we analyze the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels using the Boltzmann equation:

\[
\frac{n_1}{n_2} = \frac{g_1}{g_2} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right),
\]

where \( g_1 \) and \( g_2 \) are the statistical weights of the levels, \( \Delta E \) is the energy difference between the levels, \( k \) is the Boltzmann constant, and \( T \) is the temperature. The ratio decreases when the star has spots because the effective temperature (\( T \)) of the photosphere drops from 6000 K to 5500 K.

The factor by which the ratio changes is given by:

\[
\text{Factor} = \frac{\left(\frac{n_1}{n_2}\right)_{6000}}{\left(\frac{n_1}{n_2}\right)_{5500}} = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{5500} - \frac{1}{6000}\right)\right).
\]

### Step 1: Compute \( \Delta E \)
The energy difference \( \Delta E \) corresponds to the transition wavelength \( \lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å} = 1448 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m} \). Using the relation \( \Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} \), where \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \) and \( c = 2.998 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), we calculate:

\[
\Delta E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(2.998 \times 10^8)}{1448 \times 10^{-10}} \approx 1.372 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J}.
\]

### Step 2: Compute \( \Delta E / k \)
The Boltzmann constant is \( k = 1.381 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K} \). Thus:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} = \frac{1.372 \times 10^{-18}}{1.381 \times 10^{-23}} \approx 9.94 \times 10^4 \, \text{K}.
\]

### Step 3: Compute the exponent
The temperature difference term is:

\[
\frac{1}{5500} - \frac{1}{6000} = \frac{6000 - 5500}{5500 \times 6000} = \frac{500}{33,000,000} \approx 1.515 \times 10^{-5}.
\]

Thus, the exponent becomes:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{5500} - \frac{1}{6000}\right) = (9.94 \times 10^4)(1.515 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 1.506.
\]

### Step 4: Compute the factor
The factor is:

\[
\text{Factor} = \exp(1.506) \approx 4.5.
\]

### Conclusion
The ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in the two energy levels decreases by a factor of approximately 4.5 when the star has spots compared to when it does not. This matches option C.
