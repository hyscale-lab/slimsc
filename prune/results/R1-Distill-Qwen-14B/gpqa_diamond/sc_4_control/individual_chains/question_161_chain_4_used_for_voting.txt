Okay, so I have this question about electron microscopes and mean free paths of gas molecules. Hmm, I remember a bit about mean free path from my physics classes. Let me think this through.

So, the scenario is Mike is working with a high-resolution transmission electron microscope. He uses vacuum pumps to get an ultra-high vacuum in the sample compartment. The pressure is really low, like less than 10^-9 Torr. But even with that, some gas particles are still there, as detected by a mass spectrometer.

Mike measures the mean free path of these gas molecules as λ1. The mean free path is the average distance a molecule travels between collisions, right? It depends on factors like pressure, temperature, and the size of the molecules. Oh yeah, higher pressure means more molecules in the way, so the mean free path is shorter. So lower pressure would mean a longer mean free path.

Wait, but then he starts the electron beam. After that, he notices that the mean free path changes to λ2, which isn't equal to λ1. But the temperature of the sample compartment is the same, so that shouldn't change. So why would λ change?

Hmm, the mean free path in the absence of the electron beam is λ1. When the electron beam is on, it's λ2. What's different when the beam is on?

Oh, wait! The electron beam emits electrons into the sample compartment. Those electrons could interact with the gas molecules. But how would that affect the mean free path?

Well, I remember that when charged particles (like electrons) pass through a gas, they can cause ionization of the gas molecules. So if the gas molecules get ionized, they become charged. Charged particles interact more strongly with each other and with any electric or magnetic fields. But in this case, the electron beam is moving through the gas, so maybe the gas molecules are getting charged by the electrons.

If the gas molecules are ionized, their effective cross-section for collisions would change. The cross-section is a measure of the probability that a collision will occur. If a molecule is ionized, it might have a larger cross-section because it's charged, leading to more frequent collisions. Or wait, maybe the opposite. Let me think.

Wait, in terms of mean free path, λ = 1/(n * σ * v), where n is the number density, σ is the collision cross-section, and v is the average molecular speed. If the gas molecules are ionized, they might have a larger effective size, so σ increases. That would decrease the mean free path because λ is inversely proportional to σ.

Alternatively, could the electrons cause the ions to move differently? Or maybe the electron beam changes the pressure? No, because the pressure is already under ultra-high vacuum, and the pumps probably can't respond that quickly.

Wait, another angle: when the electron beam is on, does it cause heating? The problem states that the sample compartment temperature remains the same, so probably not. So temperature is constant, so the average speed v of the gas molecules shouldn't change.

So, with the same temperature, n (number density) is the same because pressure and temperature are same (since pressure P is nRT; if T is same, same n). So if n is same, but σ increases because the gas molecules are charged (larger cross-section), then λ would decrease.

So λ2 = 1/(nσ2v), with σ2 > σ1. So λ2 < λ1.

Wait, but wait another thing. If the gas is neutral, its mean free path is λ1. When the electron beam comes on, maybe it ionizes the gas. So the gas becomes a plasma or charged particles. How would that affect the cross-section?

I think when a gas is ionized, the cross-section for collisions increases because the ions have higher charge and maybe larger effective size. So the mean free path would decrease. So λ2 < λ1.

So the correct conclusion is that λ2 is less than λ1.

Looking at the options:

Option C says λ2 < λ1. So that's the answer.

Wait, are there any other possibilities? Let me think again.

Another scenario: when the electron beam is on, maybe it's actually causing the gas to be pumped out more effectively, but the problem says the pressure doesn't change because the temperature is same. Or maybe the beam makes some other effect, like dissociating the gas molecules into smaller fragments, which would increase n (number density). But if the pressure is the same, and the temperature same, then n is same. Or wait, if the molecules are broken into smaller pieces, each fragment has a smaller size, so maybe the cross-section σ would decrease. So λ would increase. But that's more complicated. The problem says the gas particles are detected by the mass spectrometer, but perhaps the initial assumption is that the gas is still the same.

Alternatively, maybe the electron beam causes the gas molecules to become charged, leading to them being accelerated (like in a Stern-Gerlach effect or something), but I'm not sure how that would affect the mean free path.

But the simplest reasoning is that when the gas molecules are ionized, they have a larger cross-section, leading to shorter mean free path. Hence, λ2 < λ1.

The question involves understanding how the mean free path (λ) of gas molecules in a high-resolution transmission electron microscope changes when the electron beam is activated. Initially, Mike measures the mean free path as λ1 under ultra-high vacuum conditions (< 10^-9 Torr), where the gas particles are neutral. Upon activating the electron beam, he observes a new mean free path, λ2, which differs from λ1.

The mean free path is given by the formula:

\[
\lambda = \frac{1}{n \cdot \sigma \cdot v}
\]

where \(n\) is the number density of gas molecules, \(\sigma\) is the collision cross-section, and \(v\) is the average molecular speed. Since the temperature remains constant, \(v\) does not change. Additionally, the pressure is already at an ultra-high vacuum, so \(n\) is constant. The key factor affecting \(\lambda\) is the collision cross-section \(\sigma\).

When the electron beam is activated, it can ionize the gas molecules. Ionization increases the effective size of the gas molecules due to their charged state, thereby increasing \(\sigma\). A larger \(\sigma\) reduces the mean free path, as \(\lambda\) is inversely proportional to \(\sigma\). Therefore, λ2 < λ1.

Analyzing the options:
- **Option A**: λ2 ≥ 1.22λ1 is incorrect because λ2 is smaller than λ1.
- **Option B**: λ2 = λ1 is incorrect because the mean free path changes due to ionization.
- **Option C**: λ2 < λ1 is correct, as explained above.
- **Option D**: λ1 < λ2 < 1.22λ1 is incorrect because λ2 is smaller than λ1.

Thus, the correct conclusion is that λ2 < λ1.

Answer: C
