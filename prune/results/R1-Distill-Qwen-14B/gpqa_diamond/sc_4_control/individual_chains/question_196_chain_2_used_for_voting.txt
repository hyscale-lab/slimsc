Okay, so I've got this physics problem about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through step by step.

The question is about finding the maximum speed of a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator. I remember that in classical mechanics, the maximum speed of a harmonic oscillator (like a mass on a spring) occurs when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. But wait, this is a relativistic case, so I can't use the classical formulas directly. Oh right, because at high speeds, relativistic effects become significant.

The problem gives me F = -kx, which is Hooke's law, so it's a harmonic oscillator. The options involve c, the speed of light, so clearly relativistic considerations are important here.

In the non-relativistic case, the maximum speed v_max is given by sqrt(kA²/m), where A is the amplitude. But that's option C. Since the problem is relativistic, option C is probably not the right answer, but I can't be sure yet.

Wait, the relativistic harmonic oscillator must involve the relativistic expressions for energy. The total energy in relativity is gamma times mc², where gamma is the Lorentz factor, 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

In the harmonic oscillator, at maximum displacement (amplitude A), the potential energy is (1/2)kA². But wait, in relativity, at maximum displacement, all the energy is potential, and as the mass moves towards equilibrium, the potential energy converts into kinetic. However, the total energy should remain constant, so at any point, the total energy is the sum of rest energy, kinetic, and potential?

Wait no, wait. Let me think again. In the classical case, total mechanical energy is (1/2)kA², which equals (1/2)mv_max². But that's non-relativistic.

In relativity, the total energy should be the sum of rest mass energy and kinetic energy. So the total energy E is gamma * mc². But wait, in a harmonic oscillator, the potential energy is (1/2)kx². So perhaps the maximum potential energy is when x is maximum, which is A. So (1/2)kA² is the maximum potential energy. But wait, in relativity, does the potential energy still play the same role?

Alternatively, maybe the total energy E is the sum of the rest energy and the vibrational energy. Hmm, perhaps I should think of the total energy as E = mc² + (1/2)kA². But I'm not sure if that's the right approach.

Wait, in the non-relativistic case, E = (1/2)kA^2, which is equal to the kinetic plus potential energy. But when considering relativity, the total energy would be the rest energy plus the kinetic energy. So perhaps:

At maximum displacement (x = A), all the energy is potential, so E = (1/2)kA². But that doesn't include the rest energy. Hmm, that can't be right because in relativity, the rest energy is always present. So perhaps I should model it as the total energy E being (1/2)kA² plus the rest energy mc²?

Wait, but that doesn't seem right. Because when the mass is at x=0, all energy is kinetic. So perhaps E is the sum of the rest energy and the vibrational energy. So E = mc² + (1/2)kA². Then, when the mass is at x=0, all of E is kinetic energy plus rest energy.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let's think about the energy conservation in relativistic terms. At any point in the motion, the total energy is E = gamma * mc². Because in special relativity, the total energy is the sum of rest energy and kinetic energy, which is E = gamma mc².

But the potential energy in the oscillator is (1/2)k x². So the total energy should be the sum of the potential energy and the rest energy? Or is the potential energy part of the total energy?

Alternatively, perhaps for the relativistic oscillator, the potential energy is (1/2)k x² and the total energy is E = gamma mc² + (1/2)k x². But that doesn't seem correct. Because in the non-relativistic case, E would be (1/2)kA², and when x=A, the kinetic energy is zero, so E = (1/2)kA². But in relativity, E would have to be higher because gamma is greater than 1.

Wait, perhaps the total mechanical energy (kinetic + potential) is conserved, and that includes the rest energy. No, wait, the rest energy is a separate thing. So maybe in this case, the total energy E is the sum of the rest energy and the mechanical energy. So E = mc² + (1/2)kA².

Wait, but in the non-relativistic case, the maximum kinetic energy is (1/2)mv_max² = (1/2)kA², so v_max = sqrt( (kA²)/m ). Which is option C.

But in the relativistic case, the problem is that when the mass is moving, its kinetic energy is (gamma - 1) mc². So when the oscillator is at x=0, all energy is kinetic, so E = mc² + (gamma -1) mc² = gamma mc².

But the potential energy when x=A is (1/2)kA^2, and at that point, the kinetic energy is zero (since it's the maximum displacement), so E must be equal to (1/2)kA² + mc².

So equating the two expressions for E:

gamma mc² = (1/2)kA² + mc².

Hmm, so gamma mc² = mc² + (1/2)kA².

Subtract mc² from both sides:

gamma mc² - mc² = (1/2)kA²

mc² (gamma - 1) = (1/2)k A²

So gamma -1 = (k A²)/(2 m c²)

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)

But gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c² )

So,

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² )

Let me denote (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) as some variable, say, alpha. So alpha = (k A²)/(2 m c² )

Then,

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + alpha

Wait, but 1 + alpha is greater than 1, so the right side is greater than 1, so the reciprocal makes sense.

Let me square both sides:

1/(1 - v²/c²) = (1 + alpha)^2

So,

1/( (1 - v²/c²) ) = 1 + 2 alpha + alpha²

But alpha is (k A^2)/(2 m c²) which is probably small if m is large or kA^2 is small, but perhaps not. So let me write the equation:

(1 - v²/c²)^(-1) = (1 + alpha )^2

Taking reciprocal:

1 - v²/c² = 1/( (1 + alpha )^2 )

Then,

v²/c² = 1 - 1/( (1 + alpha )^2 )

= [ (1 + alpha )^2 -1 ] / (1 + alpha )^2

Expanding numerator:

(1 + 2 alpha + alpha^2 -1 ) = 2 alpha + alpha^2

So,

v²/c² = (2 alpha + alpha^2) / (1 + alpha )^2

But alpha is (k A²)/(2 m c² ), let's plug that in.

v²/c² = [ 2 (k A^2/(2 m c^2)) ) + (k A^2/(2 m c^2))^2 ] / [ (1 + (k A^2/(2 m c² )) )^2 ]

Simplify numerator:

2*(k A²)/(2 m c²) = (k A²)/(m c² )

So numerator is (k A²)/(m c² ) + (k A^2)^2/(4 m² c^4 )

Denominator: [ 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c² ) ]^2

Hmm, this seems a bit messy. Maybe I can factor out (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) from numerator and denominator.

Wait, let me think of another approach. Let's denote beta = (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 )

So beta = (k A^2 )/( 2 m c^2 )

Then,

gamma = 1 + beta

So,

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c² ) = 1 + beta

So,

sqrt(1 - v²/c² ) = 1/(1 + beta )

Square both sides:

1 - v²/c² = 1/(1 + beta )^2

v²/c² = 1 - 1/(1 + beta )^2

= [ (1 + beta )^2 - 1 ]/(1 + beta )^2

Expanding numerator:

(1 + 2 beta + beta^2 ) - 1 = 2 beta + beta^2

So,

v²/c² = (2 beta + beta^2) / (1 + beta )^2

Factor numerator:

beta (2 + beta )

Denominator: (1 + beta )^2 = 1 + 2 beta + beta^2

So,

v²/c² = [ beta (2 + beta) ] / (1 + beta )^2

Hmm, can we factor this further? Let's see.

Wait, 2 + beta = (beta + 2 ), and denominator is (1 + beta )^2.

But perhaps I can write this as [ beta (2 + beta ) ] / (beta +1 )^2.

Hmm, maybe it's easier to express this as [ beta (beta + 2) ] / (beta +1 )^2.

Alternatively, perhaps I can factor 2 + beta as (beta +1 ) + 1.

But maybe it's better to substitute beta back in terms of the given variables.

Beta = (k A²)/(2 m c² )

So,

v² = c^2 * [ (2 beta + beta² ) / (1 + beta )^2 ]

Which can be written as:

v² = c² * [ beta (2 + beta ) ] / (1 + beta )^2

But this seems complicated; perhaps I should look at the options to see which one matches.

Looking at the options:

Option A: v = c sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (k A^2)/(2 m ))^2 )

Hmm, not sure.

Option B: v = c sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )) )

Wait, the denominator inside the fraction is 1 - (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ), so that's 1 - beta/(c^2) ?

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier. Let me retrace.

Wait, at x= A, the potential energy is (1/2)k A^2. And the total energy E is the sum of rest energy and the potential energy?

Wait, no. Because in relativity, the rest energy mc² is always there, and the potential energy is part of the mechanical energy. So E = mc² + (1/2)k A^2.

But when the mass is at x=0, the potential energy is zero, and all E is kinetic plus rest energy.

So E = kinetic energy + rest energy.

Kinetic energy is (gamma -1 ) mc^2.

So,

E = (gamma -1 ) mc^2 + mc^2 = gamma mc^2.

So, from the two points:

At x=A:

E = (1/2)k A^2 + mc².

At x=0:

E = gamma mc^2.

So:

gamma mc^2 = (1/2)k A^2 + mc^2

=> gamma = 1 + (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 )

Which is what I had earlier.

So, gamma = 1 + (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 )

But gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2 )

So, 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c² ) = 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

Let me square both sides:

1/(1 - v^2/c^2 ) = [1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )]^2

Then,

1 - v^2/c^2 = 1 / [1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )]^2

So,

v^2/c^2 = 1 - 1/[1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )]^2

Which can be written as:

v^2/c^2 = [ (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 -1 ] / [ (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 ]

Expanding numerator:

(1 + 2*(k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) + (k A^4)/(4 m² c^4 ) ) -1

= [2*(k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) + (k A^4)/(4 m² c^4 ) ]

= (k A^2)/(m c^2 ) + (k A^4)/(4 m² c^4 )

Factor out (k A^2)/(4 m² c^4 ):

Wait, perhaps it's better to factor (k A^2)/(m c^2 ):

= (k A^2)/(m c^2 ) [ 1 + (k A^2)/(4 m c^2 ) ]

So,

v^2/c^2 = [ (k A^2)/(m c^2 ) (1 + (k A^2)/(4 m c^2 )) ] / ( 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2

Hmm, this seems a bit messy. Let me make a substitution to simplify.

Let me let x = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

Then,

v^2/c^2 = [ (2 x ) (1 + x/2 ) ] / (1 +x )^2

Wait, because:

(k A^2)/(m c^2 ) = 2 x, since x is (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

Similarly, (k A^2)/(4 m c^2 ) = x/2.

So,

Numerator: (2 x) (1 + x/2 ) = 2x + x²

Denominator: (1 + x )^2 = 1 + 2x + x².

So,

v²/c² = (2x + x²) / (1 + 2x + x² )

= x (2 +x ) / (1 +x )^2

Hmm. Let's factor numerator and denominator.

Alternatively, perhaps I can factor this as x (2 +x ) / ( (x+1 )^2 )

Not seeing an obvious simplification. Let me plug in x= (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 )

Wait, perhaps I can write this as:

v²/c² = [ x (x +2) ] / (x +1 )^2

= [ (x +1 -1 ) (x +2 ) ]/(x +1 )^2

But I'm not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, perhaps we can write numerator as x(x+2 ) = (x+1 )^2 -1.

Because (x+1 )^2 = x² + 2x +1. So,

x² +2x = (x+1 )^2 -1.

So,

x^2 + 2x = (x+1 )^2 -1.

So,

v²/c² = [ (x+1 )^2 -1 ] / (x+1 )^2

= 1 - [ 1/(x+1 )^2 ]

So,

v²/c² = 1 - 1/(x+1 )^2

Which gives,

v = c sqrt(1 - 1/(x+1 )^2 )

But x is (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 )

So,

v = c sqrt( 1 - 1/( [ (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 ) +1 ] )^2 )

Hmm, looking at the options:

Option D: v = c sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 ))^2 )

Wait, option D seems to fit that.

Wait, Option D is:

v_max = c * sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (k A²/(2 m c² ))^2 )

Wait, no, looking again:

Option D is written as c sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2/(2 m c² )) )^2 )

Wait, the denominator inside is (1 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) ) squared.

Which matches what I have, because in my expression, the denominator is (x+1 )^2, where x= (k A^2 )/(2 m c² )

So,

v = c sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + x )^2 )

Which is option D.

Wait, but wait. Let me check the option D:

Option D: v_max= c√(1−1/(1+ (kA²/(2mc²)) )² )

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, but wait, another way to think about this: if the denominator inside is (1 + (k A²/(2 m c² )) ) squared, which is exactly what I have. So, yes, that's option D.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup.

Wait, another approach: in the non-relativistic case, v_max is sqrt( k A²/m ), which is option C. But in the relativistic case, when (k A² )/(2 m c² ) is small, we should get back the non-relativistic limit.

Let me check option D in the limit where (k A² )/(2 m c² ) is small. Let's denote epsilon = (k A² )/(2 m c² ) << 1.

Then 1/(1 + epsilon )^2 ≈ 1 -2 epsilon.

So,

v²/c² = 1 - [1 - 2 epsilon ] = 2 epsilon.

So,

v ≈ c * sqrt(2 epsilon ) = c sqrt( 2 * (k A² )/(2 m c² ) ) = c * sqrt( (k A² )/( m c² ) ) ) = sqrt( (k A^2 )/m )

Which is the non-relativistic case, so option D correctly reduces to option C in the limit. So that's a good sign.

Looking at the other options:

Option A: sqrt( 1 + 1/(1 - (k A^2/(2 m ))^2 )

Wait, that denominator in the fraction is (1 - (k A^2/(2 m )) ), which seems to have m in the denominator without c. So that would be dimensionally inconsistent because (k A^2)/(2 m ) has units of (N m²)/(kg ), which is m²/s². So the term inside the square should be dimensionless, but (k A^2)/(2 m ) is (m²/s² ), which isn't dimensionless. So that would make the fraction inside the square have units of s²/m², which can't be right. So option A is likely incorrect.

Option B: sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (k A^2/(2 m c² )) )

Wait, 1 - (k A^2/(2 m c² )) is dimensionless, so the fraction 1/(...) is okay. Then the square root of (1 + ...) would give something, but I'm not sure. Let me check the non-relativistic limit.

If (k A² )/(2 m c² ) is small:

Option B's argument inside the square root is 1 + 1/(1 - epsilon ) where epsilon is small.

1/(1 - epsilon ) ≈ 1 + epsilon + epsilon², so the argument is about 2 + epsilon. Then the square root is sqrt(2 + epsilon ) ≈ sqrt(2 ) (1 + epsilon/(4) ). So the maximum speed would be c times that, which doesn't match the non-relativistic case where the maximum speed is sqrt( k A^2/m ). So option B doesn't reduce correctly, so it's probably wrong.

Option C is non-relativistic, but the problem is relativistic, so it is unlikely to be the answer.

Option A and B have dimensional issues or don't reduce correctly, so the correct answer is D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the maximum speed \( v_{\text{max}} \) of a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass \( m \), maximum amplitude \( A \), and obeying Hooke's law \( F = -kx \), we analyze the relativistic energy conservation.

In the relativistic case, the total energy \( E \) is the sum of the rest energy and the vibrational energy. At maximum displacement \( x = A \), all the energy is potential, given by \( E = mc^2 + \frac{1}{2}kA^2 \). At \( x = 0 \), all the energy is kinetic, and the total energy is \( E = \gamma mc^2 \), where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \). Equating these two expressions for \( E \), we have:

\[
\gamma mc^2 = mc^2 + \frac{1}{2}kA^2
\]

Subtracting \( mc^2 \) from both sides:

\[
\gamma mc^2 - mc^2 = \frac{1}{2}kA^2
\]

\[
\gamma - 1 = \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}
\]

Thus:

\[
\gamma = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}
\]

Since \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \), we substitute:

\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}
\]

Let \( \alpha = \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \), so:

\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = 1 + \alpha
\]

Squaring both sides:

\[
\frac{1}{1 - v^2/c^2} = (1 + \alpha)^2
\]

Taking the reciprocal:

\[
1 - v^2/c^2 = \frac{1}{(1 + \alpha)^2}
\]

Rearranging for \( v^2/c^2 \):

\[
v^2/c^2 = 1 - \frac{1}{(1 + \alpha)^2}
\]

Substituting \( \alpha = \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \):

\[
v^2/c^2 = 1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}}
\]

### Analysis of Options:
1. **Option A**: \( v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 + \frac{1}{(1 - \frac{kA^2}{2m})^2}} \)  
   This expression has a dimensional inconsistency because \( \frac{kA^2}{2m} \) is not dimensionless. Hence, this option is incorrect.

2. **Option B**: \( v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 + \frac{1}{(1 - \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})}} \)  
   In the non-relativistic limit (\( \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \ll 1 \)), this does not reduce to the correct non-relativistic result \( v_{\text{max}} = \sqrt{\frac{kA^2}{m}} \). Hence, this option is incorrect.

3. **Option C**: \( v_{\text{max}} = \sqrt{\frac{kA^2}{m}} \)  
   This is the non-relativistic result and does not account for relativistic effects. Hence, this option is incorrect.

4. **Option D**: \( v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}} \)  
   This matches the derived expression and correctly reduces to the non-relativistic result in the limit \( \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \ll 1 \). Hence, this option is correct.
