Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue we're looking for is +ħ/2. They've given the components of the operator P (Px, Py, Pz) as 2x2 matrices multiplied by ħ/2.

Wait, I remember that in quantum mechanics, operators are represented by matrices, and eigenvectors correspond to states with definite values. So the eigenvector here is the state vector that P acts on, giving a scalar multiple (the eigenvalue) times the vector itself.

The direction n is in the x-z plane. So the vector n is arbitrary but lies in x-z, which probably means that the angle θ is measured from the z-axis, and the azimuthal angle φ is zero because it's in the x-z plane. Or wait, maybe φ is 90 degrees if it's along the x-axis. Hmm, not sure yet, but maybe it won't matter because the eigenvector could be expressed in terms of spherical coordinates or something.

The operator P is a vector operator, so it has components along x, y, and z. But wait, the direction we're interested in is n, which is arbitrary in x-z. So the operator we probably need is P · n, the component of P along the direction n. Because the eigenvalue equation would be (P · n)|ψ> = (ħ/2)|ψ>.

Wait, because the eigenvalue is +ħ/2, which makes sense because the Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±ħ/2 for spin-1/2 particles like a muon.

So first, I think I need to construct the operator P · n. Since n is in the x-z plane, it can be represented as a vector (sinθ cosφ, sinθ sinφ, cosθ), right? But since it's in the x-z plane, φ would be 0 or π/2? Wait, no. Wait, the x-z plane is the plane where y=0. So any direction in x-z can be represented with φ=0 or φ=π, etc. Wait no, more accurately, any direction in the x-z plane can be represented by an angle φ=0 or φ=π/2? Wait, no. Wait, usually, in spherical coordinates, φ is the angle around the z-axis. So if the direction is in the x-z plane, that means that φ is 0 or π. Because x is at φ=0, z is along the polar axis (θ=0), and the opposite direction is θ=π.

So the direction vector n would be (sinθ, 0, cosθ), because in the x-z plane, the y-component is zero. Wait, no. Because when θ is measured from the z-axis, the direction in x-z would have y=0. So n would be (sinθ, 0, cosθ), yes.

So the operator P · n is P_x sinθ + P_z cosθ.

Because P · n = P_x * n_x + P_y * n_y + P_z * n_z. Since n_y is 0, that term drops out.

So let me write that down. The operator Pn = P · n = sinθ P_x + cosθ P_z.

Each of these components is given. Let me recall the given matrices.

Px is (ħ/2) times [[0,1],[1,0]]. So the matrix for Px is (ħ/2) * [[0 1], [1 0]].

Similarly, Py is (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]].

Pz is (ħ/2) * [[1,0], [0, -1]].

So, substituting these into Pn:

Pn = (ħ/2) [ sinθ * [[0,1],[1,0]] + cosθ * [[1,0],[0,-1]] ]

Let me compute the matrix inside the brackets.

First, sinθ * [[0,1],[1,0]] becomes [[0, sinθ], [sinθ, 0]].

Then, cosθ * [[1,0],[0,-1]] becomes [[cosθ, 0], [0, -cosθ]].

Adding these two matrices together:

Top-left: cosθ
Top-right: sinθ
Bottom-left: sinθ
Bottom-right: -cosθ

So the matrix becomes:

[[cosθ, sinθ],
 [sinθ, -cosθ]]

So Pn = (ħ/2) * [[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ]]

Wait, no. Wait, let me recheck the addition.

Top-left: 0 + cosθ = cosθ.

Top-right: sinθ + 0 = sinθ.

Bottom-left: sinθ + 0 = sinθ.

Bottom-right: 0 + (-cosθ) = -cosθ.

Yes, that's correct.

So now, the operator Pn is (ħ/2) times that matrix. We're looking for the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue +ħ/2.

The eigenvalue equation is:

Pn |v> = (ħ/2) |v>

So, the matrix equation is:

(ħ/2) * [[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ]] * |v> = (ħ/2) |v>

We can factor out ħ/2 from both sides, so we're left with:

[[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ]] * |v> = |v>

Which means that |v> is an eigenvector of the 2x2 matrix [[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ]] with eigenvalue 1.

So our task reduces to finding the eigenvectors of this matrix for eigenvalue 1.

Let me denote the matrix as M.

M = [[a, b],
     [b, -a]]

Where a = cosθ and b = sinθ.

The eigenvalues of M can be found by solving det(M - λ I) = 0.

So det( [a - λ, b; b, -a - λ] ) = 0.

The determinant is (a - λ)(-a - λ) - b^2 = 0.

Expanding that:

(-a(a - λ) - λ(a - λ)) - b² ?

Wait, no. Let me compute (a-λ)(-a - λ) = -(a)(a - λ) - λ(a - λ) ?

Wait, better to compute it as (a - λ)(-a - λ) = -(a)(a + λ) + λ(a + λ) ?

Wait, perhaps I should expand it properly.

(a - λ)(-a - λ) = -a(a - λ) - λ(a - λ)
= -a² + a λ - a λ + λ²
= -a² + λ²

So the determinant is (-a² + λ²) - b² = 0.

Which simplifies to λ² = a² + b².

But a² + b² = cos²θ + sin²θ = 1.

So λ² = 1, so λ = ±1.

So the eigenvalues are 1 and -1. Which makes sense because the operator is for spin-1/2, so eigenvalues ±ħ/2, but after factoring out ħ/2, the matrix has eigenvalues ±1.

So for eigenvalue 1, we need to solve (M - I)|v> = 0.

So M - I is [[a-1, b], [b, -a -1]].

The equations are:

(a - 1) v1 + b v2 = 0
b v1 + (-a -1) v2 = 0

So from the first equation:
(a - 1) v1 + b v2 = 0 --> v2 = [ (1 - a) / b ] v1, provided that b ≠ 0.

But wait, if b is zero, then θ is 0 or π, meaning n is along z. Then sinθ is zero, so the direction is purely along z. Then the matrix M becomes [[1, 0], [0, -1]], so the eigenvalues are 1 and -1, and the eigenvectors would be (1,0) and (0,1) respectively. But in this problem, n is an arbitrary direction in x-z, so θ can be any angle, but sinθ can be zero. But I'll proceed assuming that b is not zero; if it is zero, perhaps it's a special case but the options don't show that, so perhaps the general solution is expected.

So, assuming b ≠ 0, v2 = (1 - a)/b * v1.

Let me write a = cosθ, so 1 - a = 1 - cosθ.

Then v2 = (1 - cosθ) / sinθ * v1.

Hmm, 1 - cosθ equals 2 sin²(θ/2), and sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2). So:

(1 - cosθ)/sinθ = [2 sin²(θ/2)] / [2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2)] ) ] = [ sin(θ/2) ] / [ cos(θ/2) ] = tan(θ/2).

So v2 = tan(θ/2) * v1.

Let me let v1 = cos(θ/2). Then v2 = sin(θ/2).

Wait, so the ratio v2/v1 = tan(θ/2), which is correct.

So the eigenvector can be written as [v1, v2] = [1, tan(θ/2)] multiplied by some normalization factor.

Wait, but perhaps it's better to write it as [cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)].

Wait, let's see. Let me take v1 = cos(θ/2), then v2 = sin(θ/2). Because:

tan(θ/2) = sin(θ/2)/cos(θ/2), so that's consistent.

So the vector is [cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)].

Wait, but let me verify this.

If I plug into M |v> = |v>:

M = [[cosθ, sinθ],
     [sinθ, -cosθ]]

Multiply M by [cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)]:

Top component: cosθ * cos(θ/2) + sinθ * sin(θ/2) = cos(θ - θ/2) = cos(θ/2).

Because cosA cosB + sinA sinB = cos(A-B).

Similarly, the bottom component: sinθ * cos(θ/2) + (-cosθ) * sin(θ/2) = sinθ cos(θ/2) - cosθ sin(θ/2) = sin(θ - θ/2) = sin(θ/2).

Wait, that's correct. So the product gives [cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)], which is exactly the vector we started with. So yes, this is an eigenvector with eigenvalue 1.

So the eigenvector is [cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)]^T.

Wait, but wait another thing: the eigenvalue equation is for M, which is [[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ]], and when I multiplied, I got the same vector back, which matches the eigenvalue 1.

So that's correct.

But wait, we have to normalize the eigenvector. So the vector [cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)] has a norm of sqrt( cos²(θ/2) + sin²(θ/2) ) = 1, so it's already normalized.

But wait, let me check, because sometimes when you have square roots, you may have factors to include.

Wait, but in this case, the vector is [cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)], which is a unit vector, so it's already normalized.

So the normalized eigenvector is [cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)]^T.

Wait, but looking at the options, let's see what's given.

Option C) is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Option D) is (sqrt(2/3) ħ cos(theta/2), sqrt(1/3) ħ sin(theta/2)).

Wait, but wait. The problem's options have 'hbar' in the elements, but in our solution, the vector elements are just cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2). So perhaps the options should be normalized, but let's see.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again about the operator. The operator P · n has eigenvalues ±ħ/2. So the eigenvector we found is for the eigenvalue +ħ/2. But when we set up the equation, we factored out ħ/2, so the matrix M is in units of ħ/2. So I think the vector we found is correct, but perhaps the options have the answer in terms of ħ multiplied by something else.

Wait, looking at the options, some have ħ as a factor. Hmm.

Wait, but in our case, the eigenvector has elements cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2), without any ħ. Because the eigenvalue is ħ/2, but the vector itself is dimensionless. So perhaps options with ħ are incorrect. But looking at the options, option D has ħ; option C is just the cos and sin terms.

Wait, but let's look again at the components. The operator Pn is (ħ/2) times the matrix M. The eigenvalue equation is Pn |v> = (ħ/2) |v>, so the normalized eigenvector is [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)].

So looking at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which matches.

But wait, another thought: shouldn't the eigenvector be a column vector, but the options are written as components. So option C is in terms of those terms, which matches.

But wait, another thing. The problem statement says that the eigenvector is for the operator along the arbitrary direction n. But wait, in the problem statement, the 'operator' is P, which is a vector operator. So the direction matters, and the eigenvector is for the component along that direction.

So, the eigenvector we found is correct, as expressed in option C.

Wait, but looking at the options. Option B is (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)), which looks like a spherical harmonic, but maybe for l=1. But in this case, since we're dealing with spin-1/2, the eigenvectors are indeed [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)], which is option C.

So the correct answer should be option C.

But let me double-check the options again.

Option A: (√(2/3) ħ, √(1/3) ħ) → these are scalars multiplied by ħ, which doesn't make sense for a vector.

Option B: (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)) → this seems to have theta and phi, perhaps for some coordinate system, but our solution has theta/2.

Option C: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)) → this matches what we derived.

Option D: (√(2/3) ħ cos(theta/2), √(1/3) ħ sin(theta/2)) → this introduces factors with ħ, but our solution doesn't have ħ since eigenvectors are dimensionless.

Wait, but the problem says "the elements of the normalized eigenvector". So the options must represent the vector's components without any physical units (like ħ). So option C is correct.

So I would choose option C.

The problem involves finding the normalized eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator $\vec{P}$ for a muon along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The operator $\vec{P}$ has components $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$, which are given as $2 \times 2$ matrices multiplied by $\hbar/2$. The direction $\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane, represented as $(\sin\theta, 0, \cos\theta)$ in spherical coordinates. The operator $\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n}$ is constructed as:

\[
P \cdot \vec{n} = P_x \sin\theta + P_z \cos\theta.
\]

Substituting the given matrices for $P_x$ and $P_z$, the matrix representation of $P \cdot \vec{n}$ becomes:

\[
P \cdot \vec{n} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvalue equation is:

\[
\left(\frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix}\right) \begin{bmatrix} v_1 \\ v_2 \end{bmatrix} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} v_1 \\ v_2 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Factoring out $\hbar/2$, the eigenvalue equation simplifies to:

\[
\begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} v_1 \\ v_2 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} v_1 \\ v_2 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvalues of the matrix $\begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix}$ are $\pm 1$. For the eigenvalue $1$, solving the equation yields the eigenvector:

\[
\begin{bmatrix} v_1 \\ v_2 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} \cos(\theta/2) \\ \sin(\theta/2) \end{bmatrix}.
\]

This eigenvector is already normalized, as the components satisfy $\cos^2(\theta/2) + \sin^2(\theta/2) = 1$. Comparing this result with the options:

- **Option A**: Contains $\hbar$ as a factor, which is incorrect since eigenvectors are dimensionless.
- **Option B**: Involves $\cos\theta$ and $\sin\theta$, which does not match the derived eigenvector.
- **Option C**: Matches the derived eigenvector $\begin{bmatrix} \cos(\theta/2) \\ \sin(\theta/2) \end{bmatrix}$.
- **Option D**: Includes $\hbar$ and additional normalization factors, which are not present in the derived eigenvector.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
