Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Hmm, let's try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll take it slow.

The question starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane being heated with excess KOH. I remember that when vicinal dihalides (two halogens on adjacent carbons) react with a strong base like KOH, they undergo an elimination reaction, probably forming an alkene. Since adamantane is a diamondoid structure, which is pretty rigid and has four bridgehead carbons, the elimination should form a double bond between the two bridgehead carbons where the bromines were.

Wait, but adamantane's structure is four fused cyclohexane rings, right? So each bridgehead has two rings fused. So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have Br atoms on the same bridgehead. When KOH is added, it would deprotonate and eliminate HBr, forming an alkene. So the product after elimination would be 1,3-adamantadiene or something like that.

The product after KOH is a light yellow solid, and the NMR spectrum given is 4.79 ppm (2H), which is a singlet, maybe two equivalent protons in a CH2 group. Then 2.41-2.23 ppm (10H), which could be the bridgehead protons in the adamantane structure, maybe as multiplets. Then 1.94 ppm (2H), perhaps another CH2 group. Oh, and the IR has a peak at 1720 cm-1, which suggests a carbonyl group. Wait, but product 1 is formed after elimination, which should form an alkene, not a carbonyl. Hmm, maybe I was wrong. Oh wait, perhaps the initial reaction isn't elimination but something else. Let me think again.

Wait, KOH is a strong base. When 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with KOH, perhaps it goes through a dehydrohalogenation elimination reaction to form a double bond. But that would produce an alkene, not a carbonyl. Alternatively, maybe it's a substitution reaction. But dibromides usually eliminate to form alkenes when treated with strong bases. So maybe the IR peak at 1720 isn't in product 1 but in another product. Wait, product 1 is formed after heating with KOH. So maybe product 1 is an epoxide or something else. Wait, no, 1720 is more indicative of a carbonyl group, like a ketone or an ester.

Wait, maybe the product isn't an alkene but something else. Oh wait, KOH and dibromide could result in a diol, but that would require two substitution reactions. But the problem says it's heated, which usually favors elimination over substitution. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe it's an elimination to form a carbonyl. Wait, could it be a dehydrohalogenation forming a ketone? Wait, but elimination typically forms alkenes, not ketones. Oh wait, but if the structure is such that the elimination leads to a conjugated diene, but that wouldn't explain the IR peak. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a cyclic ether, but that doesn't fit the IR either.

Wait, maybe I should think about the reaction conditions. KOH in a high temperature... maybe it's a Hofmann elimination, but that's more for amines. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Fittig reaction, but that's for aryl halides. Hmm. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this.

Wait, another approach: the IR has a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So product 1 must have a carbonyl group. So what reaction of a dibromide would give a carbonyl? Maybe oxidation? But KOH is a base, not an oxidizing agent. Alternatively, maybe the initial reaction is not elimination but something else.

Wait, maybe it's a peroxide formation? Or perhaps a nucleophilic substitution that leads to a carbonyl. Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the initial reaction is a dehydrohalogenation forming an alkene, and then an oxidation step? No, the problem says heating with KOH creates product 1, so it's a one-step process.

Alternatively, maybe the product is an epoxide. Epoxides have a C-O-C structure, but their IR peaks are around 1200-1100 cm-1 for the C-O stretch, not 1720. So that's not it.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the reaction is not elimination but a substitution forming an alcohol, but then why the IR shows a carbonyl? Alternatively, maybe it's a diol but that doesn't explain the carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the initial product is a geminal diol, but that's when two hydroxyl groups are on the same carbon. But geminal diols can form from dihalides via substitution, perhaps with a strong base. But would that give a carbonyl? No, unless it's further oxidized. But the problem doesn't mention any oxidizing agents.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck here. Let me think again. The product has a carbonyl, and the IR is at 1720, which is typical for a ketone or possibly an aldehyde, but aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10 ppm, and the NMR doesn't show such a peak. Looking at the NMR data for product 1: 4.79 (2H, singlet) could be a methylene adjacent to an oxygen, perhaps. 2.41-2.23 (10H) is probably the bridgehead protons in adamantane. 1.94 (2H) could be another methylene group. If it's a ketone, maybe it's a bridged ketone structure.

Wait, maybe the product is a diketone? No, but the IR would show two carbonyl peaks, which it doesn't mention. Alternatively, maybe it's an epoxide with a carbonyl? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a double dehydrohalogenation leading to a conjugated diene, but then where does the carbonyl come from? Unless it's a cyclic diene with some ring strain leading to a carbonyl, which doesn't make sense.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the product isn't directly from the dibromide but forms via an intermediate. Let's think, KOH is a strong base. 1,3-dibromoadamantane has two Br atoms on adjacent bridgehead carbons. When heated with KOH, perhaps it undergoes a double elimination, forming an alkene and releasing two equivalents of HBr. So structure becomes a diene, 1,3-diene in adamantane. Then, why the IR carbonyl? Hmm, that doesn't fit. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the diene is further reacted. Oh wait, perhaps the diene is formed, and then in the presence of KOH, it undergoes some oxidation to form a ketone. But KOH isn't an oxidizing agent, so I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial product is a diol, but that would require two substitution reactions. Let me think: KOH could perform a substitution, replacing Br with OH. So 1,3-diol. But then why the IR shows a carbonyl? Unless the diol is oxidized, but again, no oxidizing agent is mentioned.

Wait, maybe the product isn't 1,3-diol but something else. Another possibility is that the two OH groups are adjacent, making a geminal diol, but that's unlikely for bridgehead positions. Alternatively, maybe the reaction isn't substitution but something else.

Wait, perhaps I should look at the next steps to get clues. Product 1 is then heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide, which is a Lewis acid catalyst often used in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. So product 1 must have a suitable leaving group or functional group to react in such a reaction.

If product 1 has a carbonyl group (as per IR), perhaps it's a ketone. Then, when treated with Al(OiPr)3, which is a strong Lewis acid, it could undergo some kind of acylation. Friedel-Crafts acylation requires an acyl chloride, but product 1 would have a ketone. Maybe it's a different reaction.

Wait, maybe product 1 is a diol, and when treated with Al isopropoxide, it forms an epoxide or something else. Alternatively, if product 1 is a diol, perhaps it undergoes some kind of cyclization when treated with a Lewis acid. Hmm.

Wait, but product 2 is formed by heating product 1 with Al isopropoxide. So perhaps product 1 is a diol, and product 2 is an epoxide. Because AlCl3 (or similar) can catalyze the formation of epoxides from diols via acid-catalyzed cyclization. But product 1's NMR shows a singlet at 4.79 ppm for 2H, which could be an OCH2O group, like in an epoxide. Wait, but epoxides have adjacent protons which are typically around 3-4 ppm and are split into multiplets due to coupling. So maybe that's not it.

Alternatively, if product 1 is a diol, perhaps the next step forms a cyclic ether. But again, not matching the NMR.

Wait, going back to the first step. Maybe the initial reaction isn't elimination but substitution, forming a diol. Let's assume that. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane + 2 KOH → 1,3-adamantanediol. Then, product 1 is the diol.

But the IR shows a peak at 1720, which is a carbonyl. So that doesn’t fit. Unless the diol is then oxidized, but KOH isn't an oxidizing agent. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial step is elimination to form an alkene, and the diene is then treated with something else. But again, the IR doesn't fit.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the reaction of the dibromide with KOH isn't elimination but a substitution to form a geminal diol. So if the two Br atoms are on the same carbon, substitution would give a diol. But in 1,3-dibromoadamantane, the Brs are on adjacent bridgeheads, not the same carbon. So substitution would produce two -OH groups on adjacent bridgeheads.

So product 1 is 1,3-adamantanediol. Then, the IR doesn't show a carbonyl, so perhaps I'm still missing something. Wait, maybe product 1 is an epoxide. But then how would that form from KOH and a dibromide? Epoxides usually form from diols under acidic conditions, like with H2SO4. Not sure.

Hmm. Maybe I should think about the IR peak again. 1720 cm-1 is a strong carbonyl, so product 1 must have a carbonyl group. So elimination to form an alkene wouldn't create a carbonyl. So perhaps the initial reaction isn't elimination. Maybe it's a substitution to form a carbonyl.

Wait! Wait a second. Maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation to form an alkyne? No, because that would require a triple bond, and the IR would show a C≡C stretch around 2100 cm-1, which it doesn't.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction forms a ketone via an elimination followed by some kind of rearrangement. But I don't recall a reaction where a dihalide forms a ketone directly.

Wait, another approach: Maybe the initial reaction forms an epoxide, which under basic conditions could undergo ring-opening. Hmm, but KOH is a base, so maybe it deprotonates something, but I don't see how that would form a carbonyl.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a nucleophilic substitution with water as the nucleophile, but that would form a diol, which doesn't explain the carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the product is a carbonyl because the diol undergoes oxidation. But KOH is a base, not an oxidizing agent. Unless the diol is further treated with an oxidizing agent, but the problem states only KOH is used.

Wait, perhaps the product is an enol, which can tautomerize to a ketone. But enols are usually seen in ketones or aldehydes, and I'm not sure how that would form from a diol.

I'm getting stuck here, so maybe I should proceed with the next steps and see if that gives me any clues.

Product 2 is formed by heating product 1 with Al isopropoxide. Let's assume product 1 is an epoxide because the IR doesn't fit without one. But I'm not certain. Alternatively, if product 1 is a diol, then Al isopropoxide could facilitate its conversion to an epoxide. Wait, but diols under acidic conditions form epoxides, not basic conditions. Al isopropoxide is a Lewis acid catalyst, so perhaps it's used in an acid-catalyzed epoxidation. But product 1 would need to be a diol for that, which brings me back to the earlier point.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a diol, and when treated with Al isopropoxide, it forms an acetal or some kind of cyclic ether. Alternatively, if product 1 is an aldehyde or ketone, maybe the Al isopropoxide helps in some acylation or alkylation.

Hmm, perhaps product 1 is a ketone, say, 1,3-adamantanedione. Then, when treated with Al isopropoxide, it could undergo a Friedel-Crafts acylation, but that requires an aromatic ring, which adamantane doesn't have. Alternatively, maybe it's a different kind of reaction.

Wait, another possibility: product 1 is a diketone. Then, when treated with Al isopropoxide, it could undergo some kind of cyclization or condensation. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a gem-diol, which then forms a cyclic structure when heated with Al isopropoxide. But I'm not certain.

Moving on to the next step: ozone is bubbled through a solution of product 2 at -78°C, followed by dimethyl sulfide. Ozone is used for ozonolysis, which cleaves double bonds. So product 2 must have a double bond for ozonolysis to occur.

Product 3 is the result after ozonolysis. The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3's NMR, excluding those that exchange.

So, the key here is to figure out the structure of product 3, which comes from ozonolysis of product 2's double bond.

Putting it all together, let me try to outline the reactions:

1. 1,3-dibromoadamantane → product 1 (with carbonyl, so maybe a diol that upon oxidation becomes a ketone, but I'm not sure how that happens with KOH).

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the initial reaction forms an epoxide. Wait, but how? 1,3-dibromoadamantane treated with KOH. Oh wait, perhaps it's a ring-opening of some sort. But I don't see how that would form an epoxide.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction forms a carbonyl via elimination of HBr from each Br, leading to a conjugated diene, but that wouldn't directly form a carbonyl.

Wait, another angle: Maybe the reaction is a single elimination, forming an alkene and releasing one HBr, but where's the other Br? Maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation followed by another elimination, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the initial product is a cyclopropane? No, that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution where two hydroxyl groups are added, but that would form a diol. Then, in product 1, the diol has a carbonyl. No, that doesn't make sense.

I'm stuck, so perhaps I should make an assumption and proceed. Let's say that product 1 has a carbonyl group, perhaps a ketone.

Then, product 2 is formed by heating product 1 with Al isopropoxide. Al isopropoxide is a Lewis acid, often used in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. If product 1 is a ketone, perhaps product 2 is an acylated product. But since adamantane is a saturated structure, maybe it's not the aromatic ring. Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diol, and product 2 is an epoxide.

Assuming product 2 is an epoxide, then ozonolysis would not apply because epoxides don't have double bonds. Wait, no, epoxides have three-membered rings with two adjacent atoms connected by a double bond. So ozonolysis would cleave the double bond in the epoxide. But when ozonolysis is done on an epoxide, it would break the ring and form carbonyl groups.

Wait, but product 2 is an epoxide, and ozonolysis would break the double bond, leading to carbonyl compounds.

Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is a diene, which upon ozonolysis would break into smaller fragments.

Wait, I'm getting more confused. Let's try a different approach.

Let me think about the possible structures.

1,3-dibromoadamantane → product 1 (with carbonyl). So product 1 could be a diketone, but then how?

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a double elimination, each HBr elimination forms a double bond, but that would require two eliminations, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps 1,3-dibromoadamantane is treated with KOH in a way that each Br is eliminated, forming a conjugated diene. So the product would be 1,3-adamantadiene.

But then, the IR of product 1 shows a carbonyl, which contradicts that. So perhaps the first step is elimination, forming a diene, then some oxidation forms a carbonyl? But KOH isn't an oxidizing agent.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial product is a diol which is then oxidized to a ketone, but again, no oxidizing agent is mentioned.

Hmm.

Wait, maybe the product is a gem-diol, which can form a carbonyl via keto-enol tautomerism. But I don't think that would produce a strong carbonyl signal in IR.

Another thought: Perhaps the reaction forms a hemiacetal or acetal, but that doesn't fit the IR.

Wait, perhaps the initial reaction is a substitution, forming two OH groups, which then form a cyclic structure under basic conditions. Maybe a cyclic ether, but that would need a different setup.

Alternatively, maybe the product is a gem-diol, and under basic conditions, it could form a carbonyl via dehydration. So, the diol would lose water to form a ketone.

But wait, if it's a vicinal diol (two OHs on adjacent carbons), under certain conditions, it could cyclize to form a carbonyl. For example, in the case of 1,2-diols, they can form cyclic ketones via elimination of water, forming a five or six-membered ring. So for adamantane, perhaps the diol (product 1) would cyclize to form a ketone.

But how would KOH facilitate that? KOH is a strong base, which could deprotonate the OH groups, making them better leaving groups. Wait, but OH isn't a good leaving group. Unless it's converted into something else.

Wait, perhaps the diol is treated with KOH, which could lead to the formation of a carbonyl via elimination. Let me think: if you have a vicinal diol (HO-C-C-OH), and you eliminate two water molecules, you could form a carbonyl group. But wait, that would require the two OHs to be on adjacent carbons with the possibility of forming a double bond. Wait, but that would form an alkene, not a carbonyl.

Wait, maybe it's a geminal diol, but then elimination would form a carbonyl.

Wait a geminal diol is when two OH groups are on the same carbon. If product 1 is a geminal diol, then elimination of water could form a carbonyl group.

But 1,3-dibromoadamantane has Br on adjacent bridgehead carbons, not the same one. So substitution would form a vicinal diol, not geminal. So that doesn't fit.

I'm getting stuck again. Perhaps I should accept that product 1 has a carbonyl and proceed.

Assuming product 1 is a diketone, perhaps 1,3-diketone, but I'm not sure how that would form from the dibromide with KOH.

Then, product 2 is formed by heating with Al isopropoxide. Maybe product 2 is a more complex structure, perhaps involving some kind of cyclization or acylation.

Then, product 3 is formed by ozonolysis of product 2. Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds into carbonyls.

So, the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 would be near an electronegative atom, maybe adjacent to a carbonyl group.

Looking at the options, the coupling patterns are triplet, triplet of triplets, doublet of triplets, or pentet.

So, in the NMR of product 3, the most deshielded H would be on a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl. Such H would typically be split by neighboring Hs. For example, if it's a CH2 group next to a carbonyl, and each H on the CH2 is coupled to two neighboring Hs on adjacent carbons, perhaps leading to a triplet or more complex splitting.

But considering that ozonolysis breaks double bonds into carbonyls, perhaps product 3 has carbonyl groups with adjacent CH2 groups.

Wait, when you ozonolyze a diene, you get two carbonyls. So if product 2 is a diene, then product 3 would have two carbonyl groups, and the Hs adjacent to them would be deshielded.

But to find the coupling pattern, perhaps each H is split by two neighboring Hs on adjacent carbons, which would lead to a triplet. Alternatively, if each H is split by two different sets of neighboring Hs, leading to a more complex splitting.

Another possibility is that the most deshielded H is part of a CH2 group adjacent to two other CH2 groups, each with two Hs. So each H on the central CH2 would be split by two Hs on each adjacent group, leading to a triplet of triplets. Or perhaps each H is split by two Hs on one side and another two on the other, leading to a quartet, but that's not one of the options.

Wait, maybe the Hs are on a CH2 group that is next to a carbonyl and also next to another CH2 group. So each H on the CH2 would couple with two Hs on the adjacent CH2. That would lead to a triplet. For example, in a CH2-CH2-C=O structure, each H on the CH2 adjacent to the carbonyl would couple with the two Hs on the adjacent CH2, giving a triplet.

Alternatively, if the CH2 is between two carbonyls, like O=C-CH2-CH2-C=O, but that might not form in this scenario.

Another scenario: suppose product 3 is a diketone with a CH2 group between the two ketones. Each H on the CH2 would be split by the two Hs on the adjacent CH2 groups. Each H would have two neighboring Hs, leading to a triplet.

But wait, in ozonolysis, the original double bond is cleaved. So if product 2 has a double bond, ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyls. Suppose product 2 is a diene, like 1,3-pentadiene; ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyls, say, formaldehyde and another ketone or aldehyde, depending on substitution.

But back to the structure: product 3 would have carbonyl groups, and the Hs adjacent to them would be deshielded.

Suppose product 3 has a structure where a CH2 group is adjacent to a carbonyl. The Hs on the CH2 would couple with the Hs on the neighboring carbons. For example, if the structure is (CH2)2CO, then each H on the CH2 adjacent to CO would be next to another CH2 group, leading to coupling with two Hs. So each H would have two neighboring Hs, giving a triplet.

Alternatively, if the CH2 is next to a CH group, the coupling could be more complex.

Wait, let's think about a specific example. If product 3 is something like O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-C=O, but that's a symmetrical structure. However, in reality, the ozonolysis of a diene would more likely yield two carbonyl compounds.

Wait, perhaps product 2 is a cyclopropane with a double bond, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is a diene that upon ozonolysis forms two carbonyls connected by a chain. For example, ozonolysis of 1,3-pentadiene would give two formaldehyde molecules, but that's probably not the case here.

Wait, considering adamantane's structure, perhaps the initial product 1 is a diol that upon treatment with Al isopropoxide forms an epoxide (product 2). Then, ozonolysis of the epoxide would break the ring.

But epoxides have a three-membered ring with a double bond. Ozonolysis would break the double bond, leading to two carbonyl groups. So, product 3 would be a dialdehyde or similar.

Assuming that, the structure would have two aldehyde groups. The Hs adjacent to the aldehyde would be deshielded. Each H on the CH2 next to the aldehyde would couple with the neighboring Hs.

In an aldehyde group, the adjacent CH2 would have Hs that are split by neighboring Hs. For example, if the structure is O=CH-CH2-CH2-O=CH2, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 3 is a diketone, and the deshielded Hs are on a CH2 adjacent to a ketone group. Each H on the CH2 would couple with two Hs on the adjacent CH2 group, leading to a triplet.

So, in the NMR, the most deshielded H (adjacent to carbonyl) would show as a triplet.

Looking at the options, option A is a triplet. So the answer would be A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves a multi-step reaction sequence starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Here's the analysis:

1. **Reaction with KOH**:  
   When 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with KOH, the IR spectrum of the product (product 1) shows a strong absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹, indicative of a carbonyl group. This suggests that the reaction forms a compound with a carbonyl functional group. Given the structure of 1,3-dibromoadamantane, the most plausible pathway is that KOH facilitates the elimination of two equivalents of HBr, forming a conjugated diene. However, the presence of a carbonyl group in product 1 suggests an additional step, such as oxidation or rearrangement, though no explicit oxidizing agent is mentioned. For simplicity, it is assumed that product 1 is a diketone.

2. **Reaction with Al isopropoxide**:  
   Product 1 is heated with aluminum isopropoxide, a Lewis acid. This step likely facilitates a reaction involving the carbonyl group in product 1. A plausible outcome is the formation of product 2, which contains a double bond (possibly through cyclization or rearrangement). This double bond is critical for the subsequent ozonolysis step.

3. **Ozonolysis**:  
   Ozone is bubbled through a solution of product 2 at -78°C, followed by the addition of dimethyl sulfide. Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds, forming carbonyl-containing products. Thus, product 3 is expected to contain carbonyl groups. The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 would likely be adjacent to a carbonyl group, as carbonyl groups deshield nearby hydrogens due to their electronegativity.

4. **Coupling Pattern in Product 3**:  
   The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is adjacent to a carbonyl group. This hydrogen is likely part of a CH₂ group flanked by two other CH₂ groups. Each hydrogen on the CH₂ group couples with two neighboring hydrogens on adjacent CH₂ groups, resulting in a triplet coupling pattern.

Given the analysis, the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is a **triplet**.

**Answer: A**
