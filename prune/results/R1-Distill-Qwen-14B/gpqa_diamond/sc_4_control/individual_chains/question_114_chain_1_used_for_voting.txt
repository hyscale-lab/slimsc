Okay, so I've got a chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again.

The question is about selecting suitable reagents for two reactions. The first reaction is between butan-2-one and NaCN with some reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction is between 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile and reagent B (in H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

The options given are A, B, C, D, each pairing A and B with different reagents. I need to find out which pair is correct.

Hmm, I remember that when a ketone reacts with a cyanide ion (from NaCN), it's a nucleophilic addition. I think this reaction typically uses an acid catalyst. Oh, right! The reaction is the addition of cyanide to a ketone, which forms a cyanohydrin. For that, you usually need an acid like H3O+ (which is a strong acid) or maybe something else.

Looking at the first reaction, butan-2-one is reacting with NaCN and reagent A. The product is a cyanohydrin: 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So I think this is a nucleophilic addition where the CN- attacks the carbonyl carbon. The catalyst in such reactions is typically an acid. So I believe A should be H3O+ or something acidic. Let's look at the options. Option A has A as H3O+, B as HCl. Option B has A as H3O+, B as CH3COOH. Option C has A as NaHSO3, which is a source of H+ and SO3^2-? Not sure. Option D has A as NaHSO3 and B as CH3COOH.

Wait, another thought: sometimes in such reactions, especially when you have a ketone and a nitrile, you can use H2SO4 as a catalyst. But the options don't have that. Alternatively, H3O+ is the conjugate acid of water, so it's a strong acid, which would protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making the carbonyl more electrophilic. So A is probably H3O+.

Moving on to the second reaction. The starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile, which is a cyanohydrin because it has both a hydroxyl and a nitrile group on the same carbon. The product is the corresponding acid: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. So the nitrile is being converted into a carboxylic acid. How does that happen?

I think the conversion of nitrile to carboxylic acid can happen via hydrolysis. There are two main ways: acidic or basic conditions. For acidic conditions, you typically use H3O+ and heat. But wait, in this case, the starting material already has a hydroxyl group adjacent to the nitrile. So perhaps this is a hydrolysis under specific conditions.

Wait, the reagent is B and the reaction is in water. So the question is, what conditions would hydrolyze the nitrile to a carboxylic acid. I remember that nitriles can be hydrolyzed to carboxylic acids under strong acidic or basic conditions. But in the presence of other functional groups, like a hydroxyl group, maybe the conditions matter.

Alternatively, maybe it's a hydrolysis using HCl (acidic) or another acid. Let me think, another possibility is that the nitrile group is treated with an acid catalyst in water. For example, using HCl in water as the hydrolysis agent.

Wait, but another possibility: the nitrile is hydrolyzed using a strong acid, like HCl, and water. So the reaction would be in H2O with HCl as the acid, making the conditions acidic. That would convert the nitrile group into a carboxylic acid. So reagent B must be HCl, I think. Looking at the options, which options have B as HCl? Option A has B as HCl, option C as HCl. So A and C are possible.

Wait, but what about the other options? Option B has B as CH3COOH, which is a weak acid. Could that work? I think for nitrile hydrolysis to acid, a strong acid like HCl is usually needed, especially if the nitrile is part of a more complex molecule. Alternatively, maybe H2SO4 is used, but it's not an option.

So, for the second reaction, reagent B is either HCl (in options A and C) or CH3COOH (options B and D). Now, considering the first reaction, which required H3O+ or NaHSO3.

Wait, first reaction: butan-2-one + NaCN + A → product. So the conditions for the first step are acid-catalyzed cyanide addition. So the reagent A is an acid. Looking at the options, only A and B have A as H3O+. Options C and D have A as NaHSO3. Wait, but what's NaHSO3 used for? It's sodium bisulfite, which is used in the reduction of certain groups, like in the hydrolysis of nitriles? Or maybe in other reactions.

Wait, no, for the first step. Another thought: sometimes, when adding a nitrile to a ketone, the catalyst can be something like H2SO4 or H3O+ (like from H2SO4). So A should be H3O+, which is present in options A and B.

So the first reaction requires A to be H3O+. So in the options, options A and B have A as H3O+. So that leaves options A and B as possibilities. Now, for the second reaction, B is either HCl (option A) or CH3COOH (option B).

So, the second reaction: nitrile → carboxylic acid. Which conditions require a strong acid? I think HCl would provide the necessary acidic conditions, so option A's B is HCl. But let me think about whether CH3COOH as B would work. CH3COOH is a weak acid. Would it hydrolyze the nitrile under those conditions? Not sure. Maybe in some cases, but I think for the conversion of nitrile to carboxylic acid under hydrolysis, especially in the presence of a hydroxyl group, which might be adjacent, you need strong acid conditions.

Wait, but wait another angle: the product of the first reaction contains a hydroxyl group and a nitrile. The second reaction is converting the nitrile to a carboxylic acid. But wait, nitriles can be hydrolyzed to amides, then to acids under strong acidic conditions. Alternatively, maybe the second reaction is a hydrolysis in basic conditions, but the options don't have strong bases. So perhaps option A, B as HCl is correct.

So putting it together: A is H3O+, B is HCl. Looking at the options, that's option A. But wait, option A says B is HCl. So that's the first reaction with H3O+, second with HCl. But I need to be careful about the other steps.

Wait, another thought: in the second reaction, the starting material is a secondary alcohol (since it's 2-hydroxy). When you hydrolyze a nitrile adjacent to an alcohol, would that affect the reaction? Maybe the conditions must not protonate the hydroxyl group too much. Or perhaps the presence of the hydroxyl group makes the molecule more acidic, so maybe a weaker acid is sufficient for the hydrolysis. Alternatively, perhaps it's a hydrolysis under basic conditions, but the options don't have that for B.

Wait another angle: the second reaction is in H2O with reagent B. So the reaction is, for example, a hydrolysis of the nitrile group. If B is HCl, it's an acid-catalyzed hydrolysis. Alternatively, if B is CH3COOH, it's a milder acid.

I think that the conversion of nitrile to carboxylic acid can be done via two methods: one under strong acidic conditions (like HCl, H2O, heat) and another under basic conditions (like with aqueous NaOH and heat, followed by acid workup). But in this case, the reaction is in H2O with B, so perhaps it's an acid-catalyzed hydrolysis.

So reagent B is HCl, which is option A.

Wait, but let me think about the other options. What if B is CH3COOH, would that work? I'm not sure. Maybe with a weak acid, the reaction is slower or doesn't proceed as effectively.

So, for the first reaction, A is H3O+, correct. Second reaction, B is HCl. So the options are A and C. Wait, no. Option A has B as HCl, while option C has B as HCl, and A as NaHSO3. So, if the first reaction uses H3O+, then only options A and B are possible (since they have A as H3O+). So, if B is HCl, then option A is the correct one.

But wait, what about option D? Option D has A as NaHSO3 and B as CH3COOH. Does NaHSO3 make sense as a catalyst for the first reaction? NaHSO3 is a source of H+ (since it's Na+ and HSO3^-; in solution, HSO3^- can act as an acid). So, in the first reaction, using NaHSO3 might provide some H+ for the acid catalysis. But I'm not as confident about this as I am about H3O+ for the first reaction.

So, for the first reaction, the correct reagent is H3O+ (so options A and B), and for the second reaction, HCl (so option A). Therefore, the correct choice would be option A.

Wait, but another angle: in the first reaction, the nitrile is added to the ketone using H3O+ as the acid catalyst. So that's correct.

So the two reactions: first uses H3O+, second uses HCl. So the pair is A: H3O+, B: HCl. Looking at the options, that's option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The first reaction involves the nucleophilic addition of cyanide (from NaCN) to butan-2-one, forming a cyanohydrin (2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile). This reaction typically requires an acid catalyst to protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making the carbonyl carbon more electrophilic. Among the options, H₃O⁺ (a strong acid) is the most suitable reagent for this step, as it provides the necessary acidic conditions. This eliminates options C and D, which use NaHSO₃ for the first reaction.

The second reaction converts the nitrile group in 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile into a carboxylic acid. This requires hydrolysis, which is typically carried out under acidic or basic conditions. Since the reaction is specified to occur in water, a strong acid like HCl is more effective than a weak acid like CH₃COOH for this transformation. Therefore, HCl is the appropriate reagent for the second reaction.

Combining these considerations, the correct pair of reagents is A = H₃O⁺ and B = HCl, which corresponds to option A.
