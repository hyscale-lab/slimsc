Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I remember that mesons are subatomic particles, right? And resonance has to do with their unstable state, leading them to decay quickly. The question is about finding the mean decay distance of this meson X.

Let me look at the given data. The production energy E_X is 8 GeV, the mass m_X is 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X is 320 MeV. The options are all in the order of 10^-15 to 10^-16 meters. 

I think the mean decay distance depends on the particle's lifetime and its velocity. Oh wait, the formula for the mean path is something like c multiplied by the lifetime (τ) multiplied by the velocity (v) of the particle. Right, the formula is L = c * τ * v. But wait, how do I find τ?

I remember that the decay width Γ is related to the lifetime. The uncertainty principle says that Γ is inversely proportional to the lifetime. The relation is τ = ħ / Γ. But wait, I have to be careful about the units here. Let me think about the units. Γ is given in MeV, but I need to convert everything into standard units.

Wait, physics formula time: The decay width Γ is related to the mean lifetime τ by Γ = ħ / τ. So τ = ħ / Γ. ħ is the reduced Planck constant, which is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. Oh wait, but Γ is given in MeV, so I should convert Γ to GeV to match units.

Γ_X is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. So τ = ħ / Γ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) = (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25 s. Let me calculate that. 6.582 / 0.32 is approximately 20.56875. So τ is about 2.056875e-24 seconds.

But wait, that's the lifetime. Next, I need the velocity v of the meson. Since the meson is moving at relativistic speeds, I should use the relativistic equations. The energy E is given as 8 GeV, and the mass m is 1.2 GeV. So I can find the Lorentz factor gamma (γ) from E = γ m c². Since E is given in GeV and m is in GeV/c², perhaps it's easier to compute β, the velocity in terms of c.

Wait, E = γ m c². So γ = E/(m c²). But since E and m are in units where c=1 (GeV and GeV/c²), then γ is just E/(m). So γ = 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 8 / 1.2 = 6.666... So γ is about 20/3 or 6.6667.

Then, β = v/c = sqrt(1 - 1/γ²). Wait, because γ = 1/sqrt(1 - β²). So 1 - β² = 1/γ², so β² = 1 - 1/γ². Let me compute that.

γ is 6.6667, so γ squared is (20/3)^2 = 400/9 ≈ 44.444. So 1/γ squared is 9/400 = 0.0225. Then, 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. So β squared is 0.9775. Taking square root, β ≈ sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887. So v ≈ 0.9887 c.

Now, the mean decay distance L is c * τ * β. Because L = v * τ = β c * τ.

So let's put the numbers together. τ is 2.056875e-24 s. Multiply by c (speed of light) and β, which is about 0.9887.

But wait, let me compute c * τ first. c is approximately 3e8 m/s. So c * τ is 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = 6.170625e-16 meters. Then multiply by β, 0.9887: 6.170625e-16 * 0.9887 ≈ 6.107e-16 m. Hmm, but none of the options are around 6e-16. Wait, the options are A) 5.02e-16, B) 4.06e-15, etc.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating τ. Let me double-check the calculation. Oh wait, I think I messed up the units for ħ. Let me check: ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·seconds. So yes, that's correct.

Wait, but let me recalculate τ: τ = ħ / Γ = 6.582e-25 GeV·s / 0.32 GeV = (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25 s. 6.582 / 0.32 = let's compute that accurately. 0.32 × 20 is 6.4, 0.32 × 20.5 is 6.56, so 20.56875 is correct because 0.32 × 20.56875 = 6.582. So τ is 20.56875e-25 seconds? Wait, no, 6.582e-25 / 0.32 is (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25. 6.582 / 0.32 is about 20.56875. So 20.56875e-25 s = 2.056875e-24 s. That's correct.

Wait, but when I compute L = c * τ * β, I get c*tau = 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = 6.170625e-16 m. Multiply by beta (0.9887) gives about 6.107e-16 m. But the options don't have this. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in computing beta. Let me re-calculate beta. Gamma is 8 / 1.2 = 6.666..., so gamma is 20/3. So beta is sqrt(1 - (3/20)^2) = sqrt(1 - 9/400) = sqrt(391/400) = sqrt(0.9775). Let me compute that more accurately. Let's see, 0.9887 squared is approximately 0.9775, yes.

Wait, perhaps I should use more precise values. Let me compute beta more accurately. Let me compute 1 - 1/(gamma^2) = 1 - (3/20)^2 = 1 - 9/400 = 391/400 = 0.9775.

So sqrt(0.9775) is approximately 0.9887, as before. So that's correct.

Wait, but none of the options are close to 6e-16. The options are A) ~5e-16, B) ~4e-15, C) ~5e-15, D) ~4e-16.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of gamma or beta.

Wait, let me go back. E is the total energy of the meson. So E = gamma m c². Since m is 1.2 GeV/c², E is 8 GeV. So gamma is 8 / (1.2) = 6.666..., correct. So beta would be sqrt(1 - 1/(gamma)^2) = sqrt(1 - (1.2/8)^2) = sqrt(1 - (3/20)^2) = sqrt(1 - 9/400) = sqrt(391/400) = sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887.

Another approach: Maybe I should compute the velocity in terms of c using E, m, and beta.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the lifetime using the relativistic gamma factor. Because the lifetime observed in the lab frame is longer than the proper lifetime due to time dilation. Oh wait! Wait a minute, I think I messed that up.

Wait, the proper lifetime (tau_0) is the lifetime in the particle's rest frame. The observed lifetime (tau) is gamma multiplied by tau_0. But wait, the decay width is related to the proper lifetime, not the observed lifetime. Because the width is determined in the particle's rest frame.

Wait, no, let me think again. The decay width Γ is the total decay rate, which is measured in the rest frame. So when a particle is moving, its lifetime is longer by gamma. So when calculating the mean path, the lifetime we should use is the dilated one, tau = gamma * tau_0.

Ah, so I think I might have gotten confused earlier. Let me re-express this.

The mean lifetime in the lab frame is tau = gamma * tau_0.

Tau_0 is the proper lifetime, which is tau_0 = hbar / (Gamma).

Wait, but wait: Gamma is the decay width, which is the same in all frames because it is a Lorentz invariant quantity. So the proper lifetime is tau_0 = hbar / Gamma.

So, the observed lifetime is tau = gamma * tau_0.

So, the mean decay path L is v * tau.

Which becomes v * gamma * tau_0.

But v is beta c, and tau_0 is hbar / Gamma.

So L = beta c * gamma * (hbar / Gamma).

But wait, since gamma = E / (m c²), and E is given in GeV, perhaps I can substitute.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express everything in terms of E and m.

Wait, let me put all terms together.

Gamma is in GeV, so tau_0 = hbar / Gamma = (6.582e-25 GeV s) / (0.32 GeV) = (6.582/0.32) * 1e-25 s = 20.56875e-25 s = 2.056875e-24 s.

Then, tau = gamma * tau_0.

Gamma is E/(m c²) = 8 GeV / (1.2 GeV) = 6.666... So tau = 6.666... * 2.056875e-24 s ≈ 1.371e-23 s.

Wait, wait, but that would make the lifetime longer. So then,

L = v * tau = beta c tau.

Beta is 0.9887.

So let me calculate L:

c = 3e8 m/s.

tau = 6.666... * 2.056875e-24 s = approximately 1.371e-23 s.

So beta * c * tau = 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s * 1.371e-23 s.

Let me compute that:

3e8 * 1.371e-23 = 4.113e-15 m.

Multiply by 0.9887 gives about 4.066e-15 m.

Wait, that's approximately 4.066e-15 meters, which is close to option B (4.0655e-15 m) or D (4.0655e-16 m). Hmm, option B is 4.0655e-15, which matches.

Wait, but in my earlier approach, I used tau as the proper lifetime and got a shorter distance. But I think using the dilated lifetime gives a longer path. So perhaps the correct approach is to include the gamma factor here.

So let's redo this step by step.

1. Proper lifetime tau_0 = hbar / Gamma = (6.582e-25 GeV s) / (0.32 GeV) = 2.056875e-24 s.

2. Observed lifetime tau = gamma * tau_0.

Gamma is 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 6.666666... So tau = 6.666666... * 2.056875e-24 s = 1.371e-23 s.

3. Velocity v = beta c = 0.9887 c.

4. Decay length L = v * tau = 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s * 1.371e-23 s.

Compute:

3e8 * 1.371e-23 = 4.113e-15 m.

Multiply by 0.9887: 4.113e-15 * 0.9887 ≈ 4.065e-15 m.

Which is approximately 4.065e-15 meters, matching option B.

Wait, but looking at the options, option B is 4.0655 * 10^-15 m. So that's the correct answer.

So the correct answer should be option B.

To determine the mean decay distance of the meson resonance \( X \), we use the formula for the mean decay path:

\[
L = v \cdot \tau = \beta c \cdot \tau
\]

where \( \tau \) is the observed lifetime, \( \beta = v/c \) is the velocity in units of the speed of light, and \( c \) is the speed of light. The observed lifetime \( \tau \) is related to the proper lifetime \( \tau_0 \) by time dilation:

\[
\tau = \gamma \tau_0
\]

The proper lifetime \( \tau_0 \) is related to the decay width \( \Gamma \) by:

\[
\tau_0 = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma}
\]

### Step 1: Calculate the proper lifetime \( \tau_0 \)
The decay width is given as \( \Gamma = 320 \, \text{MeV} = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \). Using \( \hbar \approx 6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV·s} \), we find:

\[
\tau_0 = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma} = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-25}}{0.32} \approx 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the observed lifetime \( \tau \)
The Lorentz factor \( \gamma \) is given by:

\[
\gamma = \frac{E}{m}
\]

where \( E = 8 \, \text{GeV} \) is the total energy, and \( m = 1.2 \, \text{GeV}/c^2 \) is the mass. Substituting:

\[
\gamma = \frac{8}{1.2} \approx 6.6667
\]

The observed lifetime is then:

\[
\tau = \gamma \tau_0 = 6.6667 \cdot 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \approx 1.371 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{s}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the velocity \( \beta \)
The velocity \( \beta \) is related to \( \gamma \) by:

\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}}
\]

Substituting \( \gamma = 6.6667 \):

\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{(6.6667)^2}} = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{44.444}} \approx \sqrt{0.9775} \approx 0.9887
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the mean decay distance \( L \)
The mean decay distance is:

\[
L = \beta c \tau
\]

Substituting \( \beta \approx 0.9887 \), \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), and \( \tau \approx 1.371 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{s} \):

\[
L = 0.9887 \cdot (3 \times 10^8) \cdot (1.371 \times 10^{-23})
\]

First, calculate \( c \cdot \tau \):

\[
c \cdot \tau = (3 \times 10^8) \cdot (1.371 \times 10^{-23}) \approx 4.113 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}
\]

Then multiply by \( \beta \):

\[
L = 0.9887 \cdot 4.113 \times 10^{-15} \approx 4.065 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}
\]

### Final Answer
The mean decay distance is approximately \( 4.065 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \), which matches option **B**.

**Answer: B**
