Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me try to think it through. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll give it a shot.

The problem says we have an ensemble of 10,000 identical systems, each with a particle moving along a tube (x-axis). The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Wait, that seems a bit odd. I remember that wave functions usually have both real and imaginary parts, but I'm not entirely sure about that. Oh right, because the wave function can be complex, that's correct.

The key point here is that when measuring the position, none of the particles were found outside the region where x is between 1 and 3. So the wave function must be zero outside this interval, right? Or wait, no—no, that's not exactly it. Because in quantum mechanics, the probability of finding a particle is given by the square of the absolute value of the wave function. So if the wave function is zero outside a region, the probability is zero there. But in this case, the wave function isn't zero outside x=1 to x=3, but the measurements found none there. That suggests that the probability is zero outside that region. So perhaps the wave function given is only valid between x=1 and x=3, and zero elsewhere. But wait, the question states that the wave function is as given in a part of space where the particle can exist. So maybe that part is from x =1 to x=3? So the wave function is defined as (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i in that region, and zero elsewhere.

But wait, the problem says when they measured, none were found outside x=1 and x=3. So that means the wave function must be zero outside that interval. So for x <1 and x>3, the wave function is zero. Only between 1 and 3 is it non-zero. So the given wave function is for the region between 1 and 3, and zero otherwise.

Now, I'm trying to find the value of a. So probably, we need to normalize the wave function. Because the integral of the probability density over all space should be 1.

So the probability density is |ψ(x)|². So ψ(x) is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So the modulus squared is [ (a/sqrt(1+x))² + (0.5)^2 ], because when you square a complex number, (a + ib)^2 is a² + b² if you're taking the modulus squared, which is (a + ib)(a - ib) = a² + b².

Wait, no. Let me correct that. The modulus squared is (real part)^2 + (imaginary part)^2. So for ψ(x) = (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i, the real part is (a/sqrt(1+x)) and the imaginary part is -0.5. So |ψ(x)|² is [a²/(1+x)] + (0.5)^2.

So the integral of |ψ(x)|² dx from x=1 to x=3 must equal 1.

So, the integral from 1 to 3 of [ (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx = 1.

Let me write that out:

∫₁³ [ (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx = 1.

We can split this integral into two parts:

a² ∫₁³ (1/(1+x)) dx + 0.25 ∫₁³ dx = 1.

Compute each integral separately.

First integral: ∫ 1/(1+x) dx from 1 to 3. The integral of 1/(1+x) is ln|1+x|. Evaluated from 1 to 3:

ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(4/2) = ln(2).

Second integral: ∫ dx from 1 to3 is simply 3 -1 = 2.

So putting it all together:

a² * ln(2) + 0.25 * 2 = 1.

Simplify:

a² * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

Subtract 0.5 from both sides:

a² * ln(2) = 0.5.

So a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

Compute ln(2) approximates to 0.6931.

So 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

So a² ≈ 0.7213 → a is sqrt(0.7213). Let me calculate that.

Wait wait, no, wait. Let me double-check the numbers.

Wait, 0.5 is 0.5, ln(2) is approximately 0.6931.

So 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

So a² = 0.7213 → a ≈ sqrt(0.7213).

What's sqrt(0.7213)? Well, sqrt(0.7225)=0.85 because 0.85^2=0.7225. So 0.7213 is a bit less, so around 0.849.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.85, which is very close. Option D is 0.6, which is sqrt(0.36) which is much less. So 0.85 is the likely correct answer.

Wait a second, but let me check if I did the integral correctly. The wave function is ψ(x) = [ a / sqrt(1+x) ] - 0.5i. So the modulus squared is (a^2)/(1+x) + (0.5)^2, right? Yes.

So integrating from 1 to3:

∫₁³ [ a²/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx = integral of a²/(1+x) is a² ln(1+x) from 1 to 3. So ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(2), which is correct. The other part is 0.25*(3-1) = 0.5. So the equation becomes a squared times ln(2) plus 0.5 equals 1, so a squared is 0.5/(ln 2) ≈ 0.7213, and a is sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849, which is close to 0.85. So the correct answer is option B.

To determine the value of \( a \), we start by normalizing the wave function. The wave function is given as \( \psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i \) within the region \( x \in [1, 3] \), and it is zero outside this interval. The normalization condition requires that the total probability over all space equals 1, i.e.,

\[
\int_{-\infty}^\infty |\psi(x)|^2 dx = 1.
\]

Since \( \psi(x) = 0 \) outside \( x \in [1, 3] \), the integral reduces to:

\[
\int_1^3 |\psi(x)|^2 dx = 1.
\]

The probability density is \( |\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (-0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25 \). Substituting this into the integral:

\[
\int_1^3 \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1.
\]

This can be split into two separate integrals:

\[
a^2 \int_1^3 \frac{1}{1+x} dx + 0.25 \int_1^3 dx = 1.
\]

1. Compute \( \int_1^3 \frac{1}{1+x} dx \):  
   The integral of \( \frac{1}{1+x} \) is \( \ln|1+x| \). Evaluating from 1 to 3:

   \[
   \ln(4) - \ln(2) = \ln\left(\frac{4}{2}\right) = \ln(2).
   \]

2. Compute \( \int_1^3 dx \):  
   This is simply \( 3 - 1 = 2 \).

Substituting these results back:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.25 \cdot 2 = 1.
\]

Simplify:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.
\]

Subtract 0.5 from both sides:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) = 0.5.
\]

Solve for \( a^2 \):

\[
a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}.
\]

Using \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \):

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7213.
\]

Take the square root:

\[
a \approx \sqrt{0.7213} \approx 0.85.
\]

Thus, the value of \( a \) is approximately 0.85, which corresponds to option **B**.
