Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question is about a star similar to the Sun, with a radius equal to that of the Sun. One hemisphere is covered in dark spots, and the filling factor is 20%. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. The scenario is that when the star rotates, the spots come into view, causing periodic brightness variations. The twist is that this situation can mimic the presence of an exoplanet. The question is, if the star wasn't covered by spots, what radius would a planet need to have to produce the same amplitude in the light curve?

Hmm, the options given are A to D, with some fractions like 0.39, 0.07, 0.11, 0.32. I think I need to calculate the relative radius of the planet compared to the star.

First, I should probably model the situation. When a planet transits in front of a star, it blocks some of the star's light. The depth of the dip in brightness (the transit depth) depends on the size of the planet relative to the star. The formula I remember is that the fractional change in brightness, delta F, is approximately (R_planet / R_star)^2. But wait, that's for when the planet is directly in front of the star, causing a transit. However, in this case, the star's brightness variation is due to spots, not a planet.

So when a star has spots, the brightness change depends on the area of the spots and their temperature relative to the rest of the star. Because spots are cooler, when they rotate into view, the observed brightness decreases. The effect is similar to a planet blocking light, but the calculation is a bit different.

Let me think. The star's total brightness without spots would be based on its entire surface area. When spots are present, the brightness drops when spots are in view. The change in brightness (delta F) is the difference between the star's normal flux and the flux when spots are blocking part of the view.

The flux from a star is proportional to its surface area and the fourth power of its temperature. But wait, the star's overall flux is a combination of the unspotted and spotted regions. Let me model it.

The star's effective temperature is 6000 K. The spots are 1000 K cooler, so their temperature is 5000 K. The filling factor is 20%, so 20% of the hemisphere is covered in spots. Wait, but it's one hemisphere; so the total area covered by spots is 20% of the hemisphere's area.

Wait, the star's total surface area is 4πR^2. But the hemisphere is 2πR^2. So 20% of that is 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR². So the area of the spots is 0.4πR².

The flux from the star without any spots would be F0 = σTeff^4 * 4πR² / 4πR² = σTeff^4 (since the 4πR² cancels). But when spots are present, the flux is F = (unspotted area * Teff^4 + spotted area * T_spot^4) / (total area).

Wait, the flux is the sum of each area's contribution. So F = ( (1 - filling factor) * Teff^4 * area_hemisphere + filling factor * T_spot^4 * area_spots ) ) / total_area?

Wait, no. Alternatively, the entire star's flux can be considered as the sum of each element's flux. But in this case, one hemisphere has spots, the other doesn't. So the unspotted part is (1 - 0.2) * 2πR², and the spotted part is 0.2 * 2πR².

Wait, no. Wait, the filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere covered. So the entire star's surface is 4πR². But only one hemisphere (2πR²) is spotted, with 20% of that covered. So the total area of spots is 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4π R².

So the flux when the star is viewed with spots would be:

F_spotted = [ (2πR² - 0.4π R²) * σ(6000)^4 + 0.4π R² * σ(5000)^4 ] / (4π R²)

Wait, no. Because the flux is calculated per unit area. So the total flux is the sum of each region's flux.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

The star's total flux without any spots would be F0 = σ * Teff^4 * (4π R²) / (4π R²) ) = σ Teff^4. But wait, when you have spots, the flux is the sum of the contributions from the unspotted and spotted areas.

So F_spotted = (unspotted area * Teff^4 + spotted area * T_spot^4) / (total area)

Wait, but the total area is the entire surface, 4π R². But in our case, the spots are on one hemisphere. So the unspotted area is (2π R²) * (1 - 0.2) ) = 1.6 π R². The spotted area is 0.4 π R².

So F_spotted = [1.6 π R² * (6000)^4 + 0.4 π R² * (5000)^4 ] / (4 π R² )

Simplify this:

Factor out π R²:

[ (1.6 * 6000^4 + 0.4 *5000^4) * π R² ] / (4 π R² )

The π R² cancels out.

So F_spotted = (1.6 * 6000^4 + 0.4 *5000^4) / 4

Compute this.

Now, the star's flux without spots would be F0 = (4π R² * 6000^4 ) / (4 π R² ) ) = 6000^4.

Wait no, wait. The star's flux when it's fully unspotted (without any spots) is F0 = σ Teff^4 * (4 π R²) / (4 π R²) ) = σ Teff^4. Alternatively, perhaps I should just compute F_spotted relative to F0.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute the fractional change when the spots come into view. Because the brightness variation is due to rotation, when the spotted side is facing us, brightness is lower, and when it's the unspotted side, it's higher.

Wait, but for exoplanet transits, the brightness dip is when the planet is in front. So the dip is (Rp / Rstar)^2, but that applies to the case where the planet fully blocks a part of the star.

In this case, the star's brightness variation is due to the spots. So when the spots are visible (i.e., when the hemisphere with spots is facing us), the star's brightness is lower. The question is, what is the amplitude of this variation, and how does it compare to the dip caused by a planet.

Wait, the question says that the brightness variation from the spots can closely resemble that of an exoplanet. So the amplitude of the dip caused by the spots should be the same as that caused by a planet of radius Rpl.

So I need to compute the fractional change in brightness (delta F) when the spots are visible, and set that equal to the dip caused by the planet, which is (Rpl / Rstar)^2. Then solve for Rpl / Rstar.

Wait, but the star has a radius equal to the sun, Rstar = R_sun.

So, how to compute delta F for the spots.

When the spots are on the side facing us, the star's brightness is lower. The maximum brightness variation would be when the entire spotted hemisphere is visible, but actually, perhaps only a portion is visible as the star rotates, but maybe in this case, the situation is modeled as the entire spotted hemisphere being visible.

Wait, no, because the star is a sphere, and when you have a hemisphere covered in spots, as it rotates, only parts of the spots come into view. Wait, but the question says that one hemisphere is covered in spots, and this causes rotational modulation, so the brightness varies periodically as the spots rotate into and out of view. However, the maximum dip would occur when the maximum area of spots is blocking the light.

Wait, but for the setup, the maximum dip would be when the entire spotted area is on the side facing us. So delta F = (F_unspotted - F_spotted) / F_unspotted.

Wait, no. Let me compute the flux when the entire spotted hemisphere is visible, and compare it to the flux when no spots are visible.

Wait, F0 is the flux when no spots are present on the hemisphere we are viewing. So when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the flux is F_spotted.

Hmmm, this is getting a bit tricky. Let me try to model it step by step.

The star's total surface area is 4π R². One hemisphere (2π R²) has 20% spots. So the area of the spots is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R². The rest of the hemisphere is unspotted, so 1.6 π R².

When the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the flux we receive is the sum of the flux from the unspotted part of that hemisphere plus the spotted part. The other hemisphere is entirely unspotted and contributes flux as well.

Wait, actually, when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the total flux is:

Flux = (unspotted area on the spotted hemisphere) * Teff^4 + (spotted area on the spotted hemisphere) * T_spot^4 + (unspotted area of the other hemisphere) * Teff^4.

Wait, the other hemisphere is entirely unspotted, so its area is 2π R².

So when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the total flux is:

F_max = [ (1.6 π R²) * (6000)^4 + (0.4 π R²) * (5000)^4 + (2 π R²) * (6000)^4 ] / (4 π R² )

Wait, but wait. No, that's not correct. The total flux is the sum of all the areas' contributions. When the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the spotted part is on the near side, and the other hemisphere is entirely unspotted.

Wait, no. The star is a sphere. So if one hemisphere is spotted, the other is unspotted. When the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the entire spotted hemisphere's flux is contributing.

So the flux when the spotted hemisphere is visible is F_spotted = [ (1.6 π R²) * (6000)^4 + (0.4 π R²) * (5000)^4 ] / (4 π R² )

Similarly, when the unspotted hemisphere is facing us, the flux is F_unspotted = [ (2 π R²) * (6000)^4 + (2 π R²) * (6000)^4 ] / (4 π R² ) = (4 π R² * 6000^4 ) / (4 π R² ) = 6000^4.

Wait, that makes sense. When the unspotted hemisphere is visible, all four hemispheres' contributing areas are at Teff. Wait, no. No, the star's entire surface is either spotted or not. So the flux when the spotted hemisphere is facing us is F_spotted, and when the other hemisphere (unspotted) is facing us, the flux is F_unspotted.

Wait, no. When the unspotted hemisphere is facing us, the entire star's surface we see is the unspotted hemisphere plus the spotted hemisphere's far side, which is unspotted? Hmm, maybe I'm confusing.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute the average flux of the star when the spots are on the side we see.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model the star as having a certain fraction of its surface at a lower temperature. So the total flux is the sum of the flux from the unspotted regions and the spotted regions.

The star's total flux without any spots is F0 = σ * Teff^4 * (4π R²) / (4π R²) ) = σ Teff^4. But when spots are present, the flux is:

F = [ (1 - f) * Teff^4 * A + f * T_spot^4 * A ] / A,

where f is the filling factor (0.2), and A is the area of the hemisphere (2π R²). But wait, no: the entire star has 4π R² area. So the total flux would be the sum of the spotted and unspotted areas.

Wait, the area of the star is 4π R². Half of it is a hemisphere. So one hemisphere (2π R²) is spotted with 20% of its area covered in spots. So the area of the spots is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R². The rest of the star is unspotted, which is 4π R² - 0.4 π R² = 3.6 π R².

Wait, no. Wait, the filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere covered. So the area of the spots is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R². The rest of the hemisphere is unspotted, so 2π R² - 0.4π R² = 1.6 π R². The other hemisphere is entirely unspotted, so 2π R². So total unspotted area is 1.6 π R² + 2π R² = 3.6 π R².

So the total flux when spots are present is:

F = [ (3.6 π R²) * Teff^4 + (0.4 π R²) * T_spot^4 ] / (4 π R² )

Simplify:

F = [3.6 Teff^4 + 0.4 T_spot^4 ] / 4

Because π R² cancels out.

So F = (3.6 * 6000^4 + 0.4 *5000^4 ) / 4.

Wait, but when the star's spots are on the far side, the flux would be higher. So the maximum flux is when the unspotted hemisphere is facing us, which is F_unspotted = [ (3.6 π R² + 0.4 π R²) * Teff^4 ] / (4 π R² ) ) = [4 π R² Teff^4 ] / (4 π R² ) = Teff^4.

Wait, no. If the star is entirely made up of unspotted areas except for 0.4 π R², then when the unspotted hemisphere is facing us, the flux is:

F_unspotted = [ (3.6 π R²) * Teff^4 + (2 π R²) * Teff^4 ] / (4 π R² )

Wait, no. Wait, when the unspotted hemisphere is facing us, the entire surface we see is 2π R² (the unspotted hemisphere) and the other hemisphere is 2π R². But the other hemisphere is entirely unspotted as well, except for 0.4 π R² which is on the far side. So when the unspotted hemisphere is facing us, the flux is:

( (2 π R²) * Teff^4 ) + ( (2 π R² - 0.4 π R²) ) * Teff^4 ) + (0.4 π R²) * T_spot^4 ) / (4 π R² )

Wait no, this is getting too complicated. Let me think differently.

Alternatively, the star's brightness variation is periodic due to rotation, and the amplitude of the variation is the difference between when the spots are facing us and when they are not.

The maximum dip occurs when the maximum area of the spots is blocking our view. So the dip in brightness (delta F) is the difference between F_unspotted and F_spotted.

F_unspotted is when no spots are visible. That would be when the unspotted hemisphere is facing us, so the flux is F_unspotted = ( (3.6 π R²) * Teff^4 + (2 π R²) * Teff^4 ) / (4 π R²) ) = (5.6 π R² * Teff^4 ) / (4 π R² ) = (5.6 /4 ) * Teff^4 = 1.4 Teff^4? That can't be right because Teff is 6000 K, but the flux would have to be higher when more of the star is emitting. Hmm, perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Wait, maybe it's better to compare the flux when the spotted hemisphere is facing us versus when the unspotted hemisphere is.

When the spotted hemisphere is facing us:

F_spotted = [ (1.6 π R²) * Teff^4 + (0.4 π R²) * T_spot^4 ] / (4 π R² )

= [1.6 Teff^4 + 0.4 T_spot^4 ] /4

When the unspotted hemisphere is facing us:

F_unspotted = [ (2 π R²) * Teff^4 + (3.6 π R² - 0.4 π R²) * Teff^4 ] ?

Wait, no. Wait, the other hemisphere (unspotted) is 2π R², and the spotted hemisphere is 2π R². When the unspotted hemisphere is facing us, we see the entire 2π R² of it, and the other side (spotted) is 2π R² with 0.4 π R² spotted.

Wait, this is getting too tangled. Let me try a different approach.

The star's total flux without any spots is F0 = (4π R² * Teff^4) / (4π R²) ) = Teff^4.

With spots, the average flux is F_avg = [ (4π R² - 0.4 π R²) * Teff^4 + 0.4 π R² * T_spot^4 ] / (4π R² )

So F_avg = [ (3.6 π R²) * Teff^4 + 0.4 π R² * T_spot^4 ] / (4 π R² )

Simplify:

F_avg = (3.6 Teff^4 + 0.4 T_spot^4) /4

So the maximum flux is F_unspotted = Teff^4.

The minimum flux is when the spotted area is facing us. The minimum flux would be when the maximum area of spots is visible. But I'm not sure if that's the same as when the entire spotted hemisphere is visible.

Wait, perhaps the maximum dip occurs when the entire spotted area is on the near side. So the flux when the spots are fully visible is F_spotted = [ (3.6 Teff^4 + 0.4 T_spot^4 ) ] /4.

Wait, no. Let me compute F_spotted when the entire spotted hemisphere is visible. The spotted hemisphere has an area of 2π R², 20% of which is spots.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model the brightness variation as the difference between when the spots are visible and when they are not.

So, when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the flux is:

F_spotted = ( (1.6 π R² * Teff^4) + (0.4 π R² * T_spot^4) ) / (4 π R² )

Which simplifies to (1.6 Teff^4 + 0.4 T_spot^4 ) /4.

And when the unspotted hemisphere is facing us, the flux is:

F_unspotted = (2 π R² Teff^4 + 2 π R² Teff^4 ) / (4 π R² ) ) = (4 π R² Teff^4 )/(4 π R² ) ) = Teff^4.

So the dip in flux is F_unspotted - F_spotted.

So delta F = F_unspotted - F_spotted = Teff^4 - [ (1.6 Teff^4 + 0.4 T_spot^4 ) /4 ].

Let me compute this.

Teff = 6000 K, T_spot = 5000 K.

Compute (1.6 * 6000^4 + 0.4 *5000^4 ) /4.

Compute each term:

6000^4 = (6e3)^4 = 6^4 * 1e12 = 1296e12 = 1.296e15.

5000^4 = (5e3)^4 = 625e12 = 6.25e14.

So 1.6 * 1.296e15 = 2.0736e15.

0.4 * 6.25e14 = 2.5e14.

Sum: 2.0736e15 + 2.5e14 = 2.0736e15 + 0.25e15 = 2.3236e15.

Divide by 4: 2.3236e15 /4 = 5.809e14.

So F_spotted = 5.809e14.

F_unspotted is 6000^4 = 1.296e15.

So delta F = 1.296e15 - 5.809e14 = (1.296 - 0.5809) e15 = 0.7151e15.

So the fractional change is delta F / F_unspotted = (0.7151e15) / (1.296e15) ) ≈ 0.552.

But wait, that can't be right because the fractional change seems too large. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me recheck the numbers.

Wait, F_unspotted is Teff^4 = 6000^4 = 1.296e15 (in units of sigma, perhaps? Or it's just the value.)

F_spotted is (1.6 * 6000^4 + 0.4 *5000^4 ) /4 = [1.6 * 6000^4 is 1.6 * 1.296e15 = 2.0736e15, plus 0.4 *5000^4 is 0.4 * 6.25e14 = 2.5e14. So total is 2.0736e15 + 0.25e15 = 2.3236e15. Divided by 4: 5.809e14. So F_spotted is 5.809e14.

So delta F is 1.296e15 - 5.809e14 = 0.7151e15.

So the fractional change is 0.7151e15 / 1.296e15 ≈ 0.552, which is about 55% change. That's a huge dip. But that can't be right because a planet with radius 0.39 Rstar would cause a (0.39)^2= ~15% dip. But 55% seems way too high. So I must have made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the error is in how I'm calculating F_spotted. Because when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the flux is only from that side. Let me think again.

Wait, when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, we see half the star (the hemisphere) that has some spots. The other hemisphere is the back side, which is unspotted. So the flux is the sum of the front hemisphere's unspotted and spotted areas.

So the front hemisphere has 1.6 π R² unspotted and 0.4 π R² spotted.

The back hemisphere is entirely unspotted, 2 π R².

So the total flux when the front is spotted is F = [ (1.6 π R² * 6000^4 + 0.4 π R² * 5000^4 ) + (2 π R² * 6000^4) ] / (4 π R² )

So F = [ (1.6 *6000^4 + 0.4 *5000^4 + 2 *6000^4 ) ] * π R² / (4 π R² )

Simplify numerator:

1.6 Teff^4 + 0.4 T_spot^4 + 2 Teff^4 = (3.6 Teff^4 + 0.4 T_spot^4 )

So F = (3.6 Teff^4 + 0.4 T_spot^4 ) /4

Which is what I had earlier. So F_spotted = (3.6 * 6000^4 + 0.4 *5000^4 ) /4.

Wait, but when the unspotted hemisphere is facing us, the front is 2 π R² unspotted, and the back is 2 π R² unspotted. So the flux is F_unspotted = (4 π R² * 6000^4 ) / (4 π R² ) ) = 6000^4.

So when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, F_spotted = (3.6 *6000^4 + 0.4 *5000^4 ) /4.

So delta F = F_unspotted - F_spotted = 6000^4 - (3.6*6000^4 +0.4 *5000^4 ) /4.

So let me compute this:

Compute 6000^4: 6000^4 = 1.296e15.

Compute 3.6 *6000^4 = 3.6 *1.296e15 = 4.6656e15.

Compute 0.4 *5000^4 = 0.4 *6.25e14 = 2.5e14.

So 3.6*6000^4 +0.4*5000^4 = 4.6656e15 + 2.5e14 = 4.9156e15.

Divide by 4: 4.9156e15 /4 = 1.2289e15.

So F_spotted = 1.2289e15.

F_unspotted = 1.296e15.

Delta F = 1.296e15 - 1.2289e15 = 6.71e13.

Fractional change is delta F / F_unspotted = 6.71e13 / 1.296e15 ≈ 0.0518, so about 5.18%.

Wait, that's a more reasonable number. So the brightness dip is about 5.18%.

Hmm, so when the spots are on the side, the brightness drops by ~5.18%. Now, this dip is similar to the dip caused by a planet. So the dip caused by a planet would be (Rpl/Rstar)^2. So:

(Rpl/Rstar)^2 = 0.0518.

Taking square root: Rpl/Rstar = sqrt(0.0518) ≈ 0.2277.

Wait, but wait. Wait, the dip for the planet is when it's in front of the star, blocking part of the light. So the dip is (Area of planet / Area of star) ) = (pi Rpl^2) / (4 pi Rstar^2 )) ) = (Rpl^2 )/(4 Rstar^2) ) = (Rpl/Rstar)^2 /4.

Wait, no. No, the transit depth is (Rp / Rstar)^2, not divided by 4. Because the area blocked is (Rp/Rstar)^2 * (pi) (but normalized by the total area, which is pi (Rstar)^2? No.

Wait, no, the correct formula for the transit depth is (Rp / Rstar)^2. Because when the planet transits, it blocks a fraction of the star's light equal to the area of the planet relative to the area of the star.

So the dip is (Rp/Rstar)^2.

Wait, so in our case, the dip is 5.18%, so 0.0518. So (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.0518 → Rp/Rstar = sqrt(0.0518) ≈ 0.2277.

Looking at the options, the closest is option C) ~0.11 and option D) ~0.32. Wait, 0.2277 is approximately 0.23, which isn't among the options. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the delta F.

Wait, let's double-check the calculations.

Compute 6000^4: (6e3)^4 = 6^4 * 1e12 = 1296e12 = 1.296e15.

3.6 * 6000^4 = 3.6 * 1.296e15 = 3.6 *1.296 = 4.6656 → 4.6656e15.

0.4 *5000^4 = 0.4 * (5e3)^4 = 0.4 * 625e12 = 0.4 *6.25e14 = 2.5e14.

Sum: 4.6656e15 + 0.25e15 = 4.9156e15.

Divide by 4: 4.9156e15 /4 = 1.2289e15.

So F_spotted = 1.2289e15.

F_unspotted = 1.296e15.

So delta F = 1.296e15 - 1.2289e15 = 6.71e13.

Fractional dip: 6.71e13 / 1.296e15 = 0.0518 or 5.18%.

So (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.0518 → Rp/Rstar ≈ sqrt(0.0518) ≈ 0.2277.

So about 0.23.

Looking at the options, the closest is option D) ~0.32, which is 0.32, but that's higher. Option A is ~0.39, which is even higher. Option C is ~0.11, which is lower.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of F_spotted.

Wait, perhaps when the spots are on the far side, the flux is higher, so the maximum brightness is when the unspotted hemisphere is visible.

Wait no, the dip is when the spotted hemisphere is visible. So when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the flux is F_spotted, which is less than F_unspotted.

So the dip is F_unspotted - F_spotted, which is 1.296e15 - 1.2289e15 = 6.71e13. So the dip is 6.71e13.

But wait, perhaps I should compute the dip as (F_unspotted - F_spotted) / F_unspotted.

Which is (6.71e13) / (1.296e15) ≈ 0.0518, so about 5.18% dip.

So the planet would have to produce a dip of 5.18%.

So (Rpl/Rstar)^2 = 0.0518 → Rpl/Rstar ≈ 0.2277.

But none of the options match that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the brightness variation caused by the spots is not the dip but a more complex modulation. Alternatively, perhaps I should model the situation as the star having a certain effective temperature variation, and the brightness variation is due to the spots rotating into view.

Alternatively, perhaps the amplitude is not the dip but the peak-to-peak variation. So when the spots are on the side, the flux is lower, and when they're on the far side, the flux is higher than average.

Wait, but if the star is covered in spots, the average flux would be lower than the unspotted case. So the peak-to-peak variation would be (F_unspotted - F_spotted) + (F_unspotted - F_spotted) ) ? No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the maximum brightness is when no spots are visible, and the minimum is when maximum spots are visible.

But in any case, the dip is about 5.18% for the spot case.

So the planet needs to cause a dip of the same amplitude, 5.18%, so (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.0518 → Rp/Rstar ≈ 0.2277.

But the options don't have 0.23. The closest is option C) ~0.11 (0.0123) and option D) ~0.32 (0.1024 when squared). Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the area.

Wait, another thought: the filling factor is 20%, but perhaps I should be considering the spots as a certain fraction of the star's surface area.

Wait, the star's surface area is 4π R². One hemisphere is spotted, 2π R². The filling factor is 20% of that hemisphere, so 0.2 *2π R² = 0.4π R² of spots.

So the area of spots is 0.4π R².

So the fraction of the star's surface covered by spots is (0.4 π R² ) / (4 π R² ) ) = 0.4/4 =0.1 → 10% of the star's surface is covered by spots.

Wait, yes, that's right. So the spots cover 10% of the star's surface.

So the average flux is F_avg = ( (4π R² - 0.4 π R²) * Teff^4 + 0.4 π R² * T_spot^4 ) / (4 π R² )

Which simplifies to:

F_avg = [3.6 π R² * Teff^4 + 0.4 π R² * T_spot^4 ] / (4 π R² )

= (3.6 Teff^4 + 0.4 T_spot^4 ) /4.

But the maximum flux is when the unspotted hemisphere is facing us. So when the unspotted hemisphere is visible, the flux is:

F_unspotted = (2π R² * Teff^4 + 2π R² * Teff^4 ) / (4 π R² ) ) = (4 π R² Teff^4 ) / (4 π R² ) ) = Teff^4.

When the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the flux is:

F_spotted = [ (1.6 π R² * Teff^4 ) + (0.4 π R² * T_spot^4 ) + (2 π R² * Teff^4 ) ] / (4 π R² )

Wait, no. When the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the front hemisphere has 1.6 π R² unspotted and 0.4 π R² spotted. The back hemisphere is entirely unspotted, 2π R². So the total flux is:

F = [1.6 π R² * Teff^4 + 0.4 π R² * T_spot^4 + 2 π R² * Teff^4 ] / (4 π R² )

= [ (1.6 +2 ) π R² Teff^4 + 0.4 π R² T_spot^4 ] / (4 π R² )

= [3.6 Teff^4 + 0.4 T_spot^4 ] /4 → same as before.

So when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the flux is lower than when the unspotted hemisphere is facing us.

So the dip is 5.18% as before.

So the planet needs to cause a dip of 5.18%, so Rp/Rstar is sqrt(0.0518) ≈ 0.2277.

Looking at the options, the closest is option D) 0.32, which when squared is 0.1024. But 0.2277 is about 0.23, which isn't an option. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the brightness variation caused by the planet. The planet's transit depth is (Rp/Rstar)^2.

But the brightness variation from the spots isn't a dip but a modulation. The amplitude of the variation would be (F_unspotted - F_spotted)/2.

Wait, no. The maximum dip is F_unspotted - F_spotted, and the maximum brightness is when no spots are visible (F_unspotted). But when the star rotates, the spots come into view, so the brightness varies between F_spotted and F_unspotted. So the amplitude of variation is (F_unspotted - F_spotted).

Which is 5.18% as calculated.

So the planet's dip needs to be 5.18%.

Thus, (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.0518 → Rp/Rstar ≈ 0.2277.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in considering the area.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the spots are on the hemisphere, but when the star rotates, only a portion of the spots comes into view. Therefore, the maximum dip is when the entire spotted area is visible, but perhaps the average dip is less.

Alternatively, perhaps the calculation should be based on the difference between the unspotted and spotted fluxes, considering the entire rotation.

Wait, perhaps the brightness variation is more correctly modeled by considering the change in flux as the spots rotate into view.

The star's brightness as a function of time would vary sinusoidally with an amplitude of (F_unspotted - F_spotted)/2, perhaps.

Wait, the peak-to-peak variation would be F_unspotted - F_spotted. But the amplitude (half the peak-to-peak) would be (F_unspotted - F_spotted)/2.

Wait, no. The amplitude is the maximum deviation from the mean. So the mean flux is (F_unspotted + F_spotted)/2.

The maximum deviation above the mean is (F_unspotted - mean) = F_unspotted - (F_unspotted + F_spotted)/2 = (F_unspotted - F_spotted)/2.

Similarly, the maximum deviation below the mean is (F_spotted - mean) = (F_spotted - F_unspotted)/2.

So the amplitude is (F_unspotted - F_spotted)/2.

In our case, F_unspotted =1.296e15, F_spotted=1.2289e15.

So amplitude is (1.296e15 -1.2289e15)/2 = (6.71e13)/2 = 3.355e13.

The fractional amplitude is 3.355e13 /1.296e15 ≈ 0.0259 or 2.59%.

Wait, that's a smaller value. So the amplitude is about 2.59% of the star's flux.

So the planet would need to cause the same amplitude. So (Rp/Rstar)^2 =0.0259 → Rp/Rstar ≈ sqrt(0.0259) ≈ 0.1609.

Still, none of the options match exactly. The options are 0.39 (A) , 0.07 (B), 0.11 (C), 0.32 (D).

Wait, 0.16 is approximately 0.16, which is close to option C) 0.11 (0.0121) or option D) 0.32 (0.1024). Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming that the dip is when the entire spotted hemisphere is visible. Maybe the actual brightness variation is when a portion of the spots comes into view, leading to a smaller dip.

Alternatively, perhaps the calculation considers the brightness variation as the product of the filling factor and the temperature difference.

Wait, another approach: the variation in brightness can be modeled as delta F = F0 * ( (1 - f) * (Teff^4 - T_spot^4 ) ) / (4 * Teff^4 )

Where f is the filling factor, 0.2.

So delta F = F0 * (0.8 * (6000^4 -5000^4 )) / (4 *6000^4 )

Compute this:

6000^4 = 1.296e15.

5000^4 = 6.25e14.

So 6000^4 -5000^4 = 6.71e14.

So delta F = F0 * (0.8 *6.71e14 ) / (4 *1.296e15 )

Compute denominator: 4 *1.296e15 =5.184e15.

Numerator: 0.8 *6.71e14 =5.368e14.

So delta F = F0 * (5.368e14 /5.184e15 ) = F0 * (0.1035) → about 10.35% dip.

Wait, but that can't be right because earlier calculation using the area gave a 5.18% dip.

Hmm, perhaps this method is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the variation is (delta F) = (1 - f) * (Teff^4 - T_spot^4 ) / Teff^4.

Wait, perhaps that's not correct either.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct way to model it is to consider the flux change when a portion of the star's surface is covered by a cooler spot.

The change in flux is delta F = (F_unspotted - F_spotted ) = (Area_unspotted * Teff^4 + Area_spotted * T_spot^4 ) / (Total area )

Wait, no, perhaps the correct formula is:

delta F = ( (Area_unspotted * Teff^4 + Area_spotted * T_spot^4 ) - (Area_unspotted * Teff^4 + Area_spotted * Teff^4 ) ) / (Total area * Teff^4 )

Which simplifies to:

delta F = (Area_spotted (T_spot^4 - Teff^4 )) / (Total area * Teff^4 )

So delta F = (0.4 π R² ) * (5000^4 -6000^4 ) / (4 π R² * 6000^4 )

Simplify:

delta F = 0.4 * (5000^4 -6000^4 ) / (4 *6000^4 )

Compute numerator: 5000^4 is 6.25e14, 6000^4 is 1.296e15. So 6.25e14 -1.296e15 = -6.71e14.

So delta F = 0.4 * (-6.71e14 ) / (4 *1.296e15 )

= (-0.4/4) * (6.71e14 /1.296e15 )

= (-0.1) * (0.518 )

= -0.0518 → about -5.18% dip.

So the dip is 5.18%, same as earlier.

So the planet's dip should be the same, 5.18%, so Rp/Rstar = sqrt(0.0518) ≈0.2277.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in calculation.

Wait, looking at the options, option D is 0.32. Let's compute (0.32)^2=0.1024, which is 10.24%. That's higher than our 5.18% dip. So perhaps I'm missing a factor somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the filling factor is 20% of the entire star's surface, not 20% of a hemisphere. Because in the problem statement, it says one hemisphere is covered with a filling factor of 20%. So the entire star's surface is 4π R². So the filling factor is 0.2 for the hemisphere, meaning the area of spots is 0.2*(2π R²) =0.4π R².

So 0.4π R² is the area of spots. So the fraction of the star's surface covered by spots is 0.4π R² /4π R² =0.1 →10%.

So when the spots are on the side, the flux is lower by the same 5.18% as before.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that the star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spot temperature is 5000K. So the flux from the spots is lower, but the effect on the overall flux is more accurately calculated by (T_spot^4 - Teff^4) multiplied by the area.

So the dip is ( (T_spot^4 - Teff^4 ) * area_spots ) / (Teff^4 * area_total )

Which is:

delta F = ( (5000^4 -6000^4 ) * 0.4 π R² ) / (6000^4 *4 π R² )

= ( (625e12 - 1296e12 ) *0.4 ) / (4 *1296e12 )

= ( (-671e12) *0.4 ) / (5184e12 )

= (-268.4e12 ) / 5184e12 ≈ -0.0518 → -5.18%.

Same as earlier.

So the dip is 5.18%, so the planet's (Rp/Rstar)^2 must be 0.0518 → Rp/Rstar ≈0.2277.

Hmm.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps the question is considering the brightness variation to be when the spots are only partially visible, and thus the amplitude is smaller.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the star is rotating such that only part of the spots come into view, leading to a smaller dip. For example, when the spots are on the limb, only a fraction is visible.

But the problem states that the star has a radius equal to the Sun, and one hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%. So the maximum dip would be when the entire spotted hemisphere is facing us. So I think my initial calculation is correct.

Another possibility: perhaps the question is considering the planet's transit as a dip in flux, but the spot-induced dip is when the star is less bright, so the planet's dip needs to be the same as the spot's maximum dip.

But I can't see any other way. So perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options, but I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should re-calculate the (Rpl/Rstar)^2.

Wait, delta F is 5.18% = 0.0518. So (Rpl/Rstar)^2 = 0.0518 → Rpl/Rstar = sqrt(0.0518) ≈0.2277.

Looking at the options, the closest is option D) 0.32. But that's higher.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that when the planet transits, the dip is (Rp/Rstar)^2, but when the spots are on the star, the flux change is when the spots are rotating into view, leading to a variation of (filling factor) * (Teff^4 - T_spot^4 ) / Teff^4.

Wait, perhaps that's a different approach.

The variation in brightness when the spots are rotating is the product of the filling factor and the brightness change per spot.

Each spot has a brightness difference of (Teff^4 - T_spot^4 ) / Teff^4.

So the total variation would be f * (Teff^4 - T_spot^4 ) / Teff^4.

With f=0.2, Teff=6000, T_spot=5000.

Compute (6000^4 -5000^4 ) /6000^4 = (1.296e15 -6.25e14)/1.296e15 = (6.71e14 ) /1.296e15 ≈0.518 →51.8%.

Multiply by f=0.2 →0.1036 or 10.36%.

So the amplitude is 10.36%, which is (Rpl/Rstar)^2 → Rpl/Rstar= sqrt(0.1036)= ~0.322.

Ah, that's approximately 0.32, which is option D.

So perhaps this is the correct approach.

Wait, so why the discrepancy? Because in this approach, the variation is f * (delta T^4 / T^4 ), which for each spot is 51.8%, multiplied by 20% filling factor gives 10.36% dip.

So the planet's dip is 10.36%, so (Rp/Rstar)^2=0.1036 → Rp/Rstar= ~0.322.

Which matches option D.

So perhaps the correct approach is to compute the variation as f * ( (Teff^4 - T_spot^4 ) / Teff^4 )

Which gives a dip of 10.36%, leading to Rp/Rstar=0.322, which is option D.

But earlier calculation considering the entire area gave a dip of 5.18%, so I'm confused.

Ah, perhaps the two approaches model different scenarios. The first approach models the entire area of the spots when the hemisphere is facing us, leading to a dip of 5.18%. The second approach models the spots as being on the surface, with a filling factor, leading to a dip of ~10.36%.

But the problem states that the filling factor is 20% on the hemisphere, so perhaps the second approach is the correct one.

Wait, the problem says the spots cover 20% of one hemisphere. So the maximum possible dip would be when all spots are visible, which is the first approach. But perhaps the rotational modulation leads to a varying brightness that peaks when the spots are on the limb, leading to a smaller dip.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct way is to model the brightness variation as the product of the filling factor and the relative brightness change per spot.

In that case, the dip would be f * ( (Teff^4 - T_spot^4 ) / Teff^4 ) →0.2 * ( (6000^4 -5000^4 ) /6000^4 ) =0.2*(0.518)=0.1036 →10.36%.

So the planet needs to cause a dip of 10.36%, which is (Rp/Rstar)^2=0.1036 → Rp/Rstar= ~0.322, which is option D.

So I think that's the intended approach.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation as the spotted star, we analyze the problem as follows:

### Key Information:
1. **Star Properties**:
   - Radius: Equal to the Sun's radius, \( R_{\text{star}} \).
   - Effective temperature: \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \).
   - One hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a **filling factor** of 20%.
   - Spots are cooler, with \( T_{\text{spot}} = 5000 \, \text{K} \).

2. **Brightness Variation**:
   - The star's brightness decreases when the spotted hemisphere is visible due to the cooler spots.
   - The amplitude of the brightness variation depends on the area of the spots and their temperature difference relative to the rest of the star.

### Approach:
The brightness variation caused by the spots can be modeled as:
\[
\Delta F = f \cdot \frac{T_{\text{eff}}^4 - T_{\text{spot}}^4}{T_{\text{eff}}^4}
\]
where:
- \( f = 0.2 \) is the filling factor (fraction of the hemisphere covered by spots).
- \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \), \( T_{\text{spot}} = 5000 \, \text{K} \).

#### Step 1: Compute the temperature ratio
\[
\frac{T_{\text{eff}}^4 - T_{\text{spot}}^4}{T_{\text{eff}}^4} = \frac{6000^4 - 5000^4}{6000^4}
\]
- \( 6000^4 = 1.296 \times 10^{15} \, \text{(in arbitrary units)} \)
- \( 5000^4 = 6.25 \times 10^{14} \)
\[
\frac{6000^4 - 5000^4}{6000^4} = \frac{1.296 \times 10^{15} - 6.25 \times 10^{14}}{1.296 \times 10^{15}} = \frac{6.71 \times 10^{14}}{1.296 \times 10^{15}} \approx 0.518
\]

#### Step 2: Compute the brightness variation
\[
\Delta F = f \cdot \frac{T_{\text{eff}}^4 - T_{\text{spot}}^4}{T_{\text{eff}}^4} = 0.2 \cdot 0.518 = 0.1036
\]
Thus, the brightness variation amplitude is \( \Delta F \approx 10.36\% \).

#### Step 3: Relate to the exoplanet transit depth
The transit depth caused by an exoplanet is given by:
\[
\Delta F_{\text{planet}} = \left(\frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}}\right)^2
\]
Set \( \Delta F_{\text{planet}} = \Delta F = 0.1036 \), and solve for \( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \):
\[
\frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} = \sqrt{0.1036} \approx 0.322
\]

### Conclusion:
The radius of the hypothetical exoplanet, relative to the host star, is approximately \( 0.32 \). This matches **Option D**.

Answer: D
