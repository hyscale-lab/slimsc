Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's read it again. The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over parallax to the fifth power, so like 1/plx^5. And the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance r. The options are various powers of r, like r cubed, r to the fifth, etc.

Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax plx is the reciprocal of distance. So plx (in arcseconds) is equal to 1 divided by distance in parsecs. So, plx = 1/r, where r is in parsecs. Or wait, maybe it's the other way around. Oh right, the formula is plx (in arcseconds) = 1 / (distance in parsecs). So distance r = 1/plx.

So the number of stars N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5. But since r is 1/plx, plx is 1/r. Let me substitute that into the equation. So N ∝ 1/( (1/r) )^5, because plx is 1/r. So that becomes N ∝ r^5. Because (1/r)^5 is 1/(r^5), and taking the reciprocal of that gives r^5. So N is proportional to r^5.

Wait, but the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range. Hmm, so I'm thinking in terms of density. Because if N is proportional to r^5, then the number of stars in a thin shell between r and r + dr would be the change in N. But wait, maybe it's the number per unit volume or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking about the number of stars per unit volume, but I'm not sure. Wait, no, the way the question is phrased: the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So when plx increases, the number decreases, which makes sense because closer stars have larger parallax. So for a given region, perhaps the number of stars depends on parallax in that way.

Wait, maybe I should approach this differently. Let's think about how N depends on distance. Since plx is 1/r, 1/plx^5 is r^5. So N ∝ r^5. But the question is about how the number changes with distance—so it's asking about the rate of change, perhaps the derivative of N with respect to r.

Wait, but the question says, "how does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?" So it's about dN/dr, the change in number per unit change in r.

Wait, but if N is proportional to r^5, then dN/dr is 5 r^4. So the change per unit distance would be proportional to r^4. But that's not one of the options. Hmm. Wait, the options are A) r³, B) r⁵, C) r⁴, D) r². So option C is r⁴.

Wait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Maybe N is the number of stars in the region, and perhaps the region's volume is considered. Wait, the region's volume would be a function of distance. For example, a spherical shell's volume is 4πr² dr. But the question isn't about the density, but the number of stars per unit range of distance.

Wait, the question is a bit ambiguous. Let me think again. They say the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So N = k * (1/plx)^5, where k is a proportionality constant.

But since plx = 1/r, substituting gives N = k * r^5. So N increases with r^5. So if you move a small distance dr, say from r to r+dr, the change in N would be the derivative dN/dr multiplied by dr. So dN = (dN/dr) dr = 5 k r^4 dr. So dN/dr is 5 k r^4. So the number of stars increases with r^4 per unit distance.

Wait, but wait, that's the rate of change of N with respect to r. So the number of stars per unit distance would be proportional to r^4. So looking at the options, option C is r^4.

But let me think again. Another approach: perhaps the number of stars per unit volume depends on r. But volume is r³. So maybe the number density (stars per unit volume) is proportional to r^5 / (r³) )= r^2. Hmm, but that would suggest the number density is r², which is option D. But that's not the same as the question.

Wait, but the question is about the number of stars in a region as a function of distance. So perhaps the region is a volume that expands with r. For example, a sphere of radius r. The number of stars in this sphere would be N = k r^5. So the number of stars in the sphere increases as r^5. But if you consider a thin shell at radius r with thickness dr, the number of stars in that shell would be the difference N(r+dr) - N(r) = k [(r+dr)^5 - r^5]. Expanding (r+dr)^5 as r^5 +5 r^4 dr + ... So the number in the shell is approximately 5 k r^4 dr. So the number of stars per unit distance (dr) is 5 k r^4, which is proportional to r^4. So that would match option C.

So the correct answer would be option C, ~ r^4.

The question states that the number of stars \( N \) in a specific region of the sky varies with parallax as \( N \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^5} \). Since parallax (\( \text{plx} \)) is inversely related to distance (\( r \)) as \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{r} \), substituting this into the equation gives \( N \propto r^5 \). This means the total number of stars in a spherical region of radius \( r \) increases as \( r^5 \).

To determine how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance (\( \Delta r \)), we consider the derivative \( \frac{dN}{dr} \), which represents the rate of change of \( N \) with respect to \( r \). Since \( N \propto r^5 \), differentiating gives \( \frac{dN}{dr} \propto 5r^4 \). This indicates that the number of stars per unit distance increases as \( r^4 \).

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
