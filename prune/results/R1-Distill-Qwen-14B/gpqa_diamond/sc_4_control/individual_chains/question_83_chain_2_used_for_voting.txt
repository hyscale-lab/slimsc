Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of titration and pH calculations. But let's take it step by step. 

Alright, the problem says we're diluting 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then, we titrate that solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. Hmm, the options are given, and I need to pick the right one.

First, I should probably figure out what the initial concentration of acetic acid is after dilution. Oh right, when you dilute a solution, the concentration changes. The formula is M1V1 = M2V2. So, M1 is 0.05 M, V1 is 20 cm³. The V2 is 20 + 20 = 40 cm³, since we're adding 20 cm³ of water. So M2 would be (0.05 M * 20 cm³) / 40 cm³ = 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Next, when we titrate this with NaOH, which is a strong base. The reaction between acetic acid (CH3COOH) and NaOH is: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^-Na+ + H2O. So, the acetic acid will be neutralized to its conjugate base, acetate ion (CH3COO^-).

For the 25% titration point: that means we've added 25% of the NaOH needed to reach the equivalence point. So first, I should find out the volume of NaOH needed at equivalence. Let me think about the moles involved.

The initial moles of acetic acid after dilution: concentration is 0.025 M, volume is 40 cm³ (0.04 L). So moles = M * V = 0.025 mol/L * 0.04 L = 0.001 mol. 

Since the reaction is 1:1 between acetic acid and NaOH, the moles of NaOH needed at equivalence are also 0.001 mol. The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, so the volume V = moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 cm³. So the equivalence point is at 10 cm³ of NaOH.

At 25% titration, that's 25% of 10 cm³, which is 2.5 cm³. So, 2.5 cm³ of NaOH has been added. Now, how many moles of NaOH is that? 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 mol. 

So, the moles of acetic acid that have reacted are 0.00025 mol. The initial moles were 0.001, so the remaining acetic acid is 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol. The moles of acetate ion formed are 0.00025 mol.

Wait, but the total volume now includes the NaOH added. The initial solution was 40 cm³, and we added 2.5 cm³, so total volume is 42.5 cm³ (0.0425 L).

So the concentrations are: [CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M, and [CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.0058824 M.

Since this is a buffer solution (a weak acid and its conjugate base), I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]).

The pKa is given by -log(Ka). Ka is 1.85e-5, so pKa is about 4.73 (since log(1.85) is about 0.267, so 5 - 0.267 = 4.733? Or wait, wait. Let me calculate it accurately. 1.85e-5 is 1.85 x 10^-5. The log of 1.85 is approx 0.267, so pKa is 4.733. Yeah, about 4.73.

So plugging in the values: pH = 4.73 + log(0.0058824 / 0.017647). Let's calculate the ratio: 0.0058824 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.3333. Log(0.3333) is about -0.477. So pH ≈ 4.73 - 0.477 = 4.253. Hmm, that's about 4.25. Looking at the options, option A is 4.26 and 8.52, which is close. Option D is 4.57 and 6.92. Hmm. Wait, let me check my calculations again.

Wait, wait, wait. Did I compute the ratio correctly? Let me see. 0.00025 divided by 0.00075 is 1/3. Oh wait, but when considering the concentrations, they are in the same solution, so the ratio is 1/3. So the log of 1/3 is negative. So yeah, the pH would be 4.73 - 0.477 ≈ 4.25. So option A's first value is 4.26, which is close. But let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the moles.

Wait, another thing: when you add 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH, the number of moles is 0.1 * 0.0025 = 0.00025 mol. So that's correct. The initial moles of acetic acid are 0.001, so after reaction, we have 0.00075 mol left. The acetate is 0.00025. So the ratio is indeed 1/3. So pH is about 4.25. So the first part would be around 4.25.

Now, what about the equivalence point? At equivalence, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate. So the solution is a solution of sodium acetate in water, which will be basic because acetate is the conjugate base of a weak acid.

The moles of acetate at equivalence are the same as the initial moles of acetic acid, which is 0.001 mol. The total volume is the initial 40 cm³ plus the 10 cm³ of NaOH added, so 50 cm³ (0.05 L).

So concentration of acetate is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

Now, acetate ion reacts with water: CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-. The Kb for this reaction is Kw / Ka = (1e-14) / (1.85e-5) ≈ 5.405e-10.

Wait, wait, Kb is Kw over Ka. So 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = approximately 5.405e-10.

So we can set up the expression for Kb:

Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-]

Assuming x is the concentration of OH^- produced. Let's let x be [OH^-].

So,

5.405e-10 ≈ (x)(x) / (0.02 - x)

Since Kb is very small, x is much smaller than 0.02, so we can approximate 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02. Then,

x² ≈ 5.405e-10 * 0.02 → 1.081e-11.

Taking the square root, x ≈ sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 3.288e-6 M.

So [OH^-] ≈ 3.288e-6 M. Then, pOH is -log(3.288e-6). Let's compute that.

Log(3.288) is about 0.516, so log(3.288e-6) is 0.516 -6 = -5.484. So pOH is 5.484. pH is 14 -5.484 = 8.516, approximately 8.52.

Wait, but wait. Did I do that right? Because, wait, the Kb is 5.405e-10, and the concentration is 0.02 M. Let me compute it more accurately.

x² = (5.405e-10) * 0.02 = 1.081e-11. Square root of 1.081e-11 is sqrt(1.081)*1e-5.5. Wait, sqrt(1e-11) is 1e-5.5 which is about 3.16e-6. But sqrt(1.081) is about 1.04. So 1.04 * 3.16e-6 is approximately 3.28e-6. So [OH^-]=3.28e-6. Then pOH is -log(3.28e-6). Let me compute this more accurately.

Log(3.28) = 0.516. So 3.28e-6 has a log of 0.516 -6 = -5.484. So pOH is 5.484, pH is 8.516, which is ~8.52. So at equivalence, pH is about 8.52.

So putting it together, the pH at 25% titration is approximately 4.25, and at equivalence it's approximately 8.52. Looking at the options, option A is 4.26;8.52, which matches.

But wait, let me double-check the 25% titration calculation. Did I miss anything? Because I'm a bit shaky on that part.

Another approach: the initial concentration is 0.025 M. When you add 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH, the moles of NaOH is 0.00025 mol, which reacts with 0.00025 mol of acetic acid, producing 0.00025 mol of acetate.

So the new concentrations are:

Moles of CH3COOH: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol.

Moles of CH3COO^-: 0.00025 mol.

Total volume is 40 + 2.5 = 42.5 cm³ = 0.0425 L.

So [CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M.

[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.0058824 M.

Henderson-Hasselbalch: pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA])

Which is 4.73 + log(0.0058824/0.017647).

That ratio is 0.0058824 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.3333.

log(1/3) is approx -0.477.

So pH = 4.73 - 0.477 ≈4.253. Rounded to two decimal places, that's 4.25, but option A says 4.26. Hmm, maybe I should compute it more accurately.

Let me compute the ratio more precisely.

0.00025 / 0.00075 = 1/3 exactly. So the ratio is exactly 1/3. So log(1/3) is exactly -0.4771. So 4.73 -0.4771 = 4.2529, which rounds to 4.25. But perhaps the options use more precise calculations.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the pKa more accurately. The given Ka is 1.85e-5. So pKa is -log(1.85e-5). Let me compute that more accurately.

Log(1.85) is approximately 0.2672. So pKa is 4.7328. So 4.7328 -0.4771 =4.2557, which is approximately 4.26. So that's why the option A has 4.26.

So for the first part, 4.26 and the equivalence point is 8.52. So the correct option is A.

Wait, but looking at the options again:

Option A: 4.26;8.52

Option D: 4.57;6.92

Which one is correct? I think I did the calculations correctly. So A is correct.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we first calculate the concentration of acetic acid after dilution. Using the formula \( M_1V_1 = M_2V_2 \), where \( M_1 = 0.05 \, \text{M} \), \( V_1 = 20.00 \, \text{cm}^3 \), and \( V_2 = 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 \), the diluted concentration is:

\[
M_2 = \frac{M_1 \cdot V_1}{V_2} = \frac{0.05 \cdot 20}{40} = 0.025 \, \text{M}.
\]

Next, we determine the moles of acetic acid in the diluted solution. The volume is \( 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.04 \, \text{L} \), so:

\[
\text{Moles of acetic acid} = M_2 \cdot V_2 = 0.025 \cdot 0.04 = 0.001 \, \text{mol}.
\]

For the equivalence point, the moles of NaOH required are equal to the moles of acetic acid (\( 0.001 \, \text{mol} \)). The concentration of NaOH is \( 0.1 \, \text{M} \), so the volume of NaOH needed is:

\[
V_{\text{NaOH}} = \frac{\text{Moles of NaOH}}{M_{\text{NaOH}}} = \frac{0.001}{0.1} = 0.01 \, \text{L} = 10.00 \, \text{cm}^3.
\]

At 25% titration, 25% of the NaOH required for equivalence has been added. Thus, the volume of NaOH added is:

\[
V_{\text{NaOH (25%)}} = 0.25 \cdot 10.00 = 2.50 \, \text{cm}^3.
\]

The moles of NaOH added are:

\[
\text{Moles of NaOH} = M_{\text{NaOH}} \cdot V_{\text{NaOH (25%)}} = 0.1 \cdot 0.0025 = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]

At 25% titration, the moles of acetic acid remaining are:

\[
\text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COOH} = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 \, \text{mol},
\]

and the moles of acetate ion (\( \text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- \)) formed are:

\[
\text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COO}^- = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The total volume of the solution is:

\[
V_{\text{total}} = 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 2.50 \, \text{cm}^3 = 42.50 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.0425 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentrations are:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}] = \frac{0.00075}{0.0425} \approx 0.017647 \, \text{M},
\]
\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.00025}{0.0425} \approx 0.0058824 \, \text{M}.
\]

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{p}K_a + \log \left( \frac{[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-]}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}]} \right),
\]

where \( \text{p}K_a = -\log(1.85 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.73 \). Substituting the concentrations:

\[
\text{pH} = 4.73 + \log \left( \frac{0.0058824}{0.017647} \right).
\]

The ratio \( \frac{0.0058824}{0.017647} \approx 0.3333 \), and \( \log(0.3333) \approx -0.477 \). Thus:

\[
\text{pH} = 4.73 - 0.477 \approx 4.25.
\]

Rounding to two decimal places, the pH at 25% titration is approximately \( 4.26 \).

At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate ion. The moles of acetate ion are \( 0.001 \, \text{mol} \), and the total volume is:

\[
V_{\text{total}} = 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 10.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 50.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.05 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentration of acetate ion is:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.001}{0.05} = 0.02 \, \text{M}.
\]

The acetate ion hydrolyzes in water:

\[
\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O} \leftrightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{OH}^-.
\]

The \( K_b \) for this reaction is:

\[
K_b = \frac{K_w}{K_a} = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.405 \times 10^{-10}.
\]

Let \( [\text{OH}^-] = x \). Then:

\[
K_b = \frac{x^2}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] - x}.
\]

Since \( K_b \) is very small, \( x \ll 0.02 \), so:

\[
K_b \approx \frac{x^2}{0.02}.
\]

Solving for \( x \):

\[
x^2 = K_b \cdot 0.02 = (5.405 \times 10^{-10}) \cdot 0.02 = 1.081 \times 10^{-11},
\]
\[
x = \sqrt{1.081 \times 10^{-11}} \approx 3.288 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{M}.
\]

The pOH is:

\[
\text{pOH} = -\log(3.288 \times 10^{-6}) \approx 5.484,
\]

and the pH is:

\[
\text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 5.484 \approx 8.52.
\]

Thus, the pH at 25% titration is approximately \( 4.26 \), and the pH at the equivalence point is approximately \( 8.52 \). Comparing with the options, the correct answer is:

**A) 4.26; 8.52**
