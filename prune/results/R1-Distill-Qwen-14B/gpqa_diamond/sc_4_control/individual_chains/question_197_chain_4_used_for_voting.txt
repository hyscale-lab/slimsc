Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these spectroscopy problems. But let's take it step by step. Let's see what the question is.

The problem says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I need to find the final product. The options are A to D, each a different organic compound. The data given is IR and 1H NMR spectroscopy.

First, I should probably analyze the IR and NMR data to figure out what Compound X is. Once I know what X is, I can think about what reaction it undergoes with red phosphorus and HI.

Looking at the IR data: The peaks are at 3400–2500 cm⁻¹, which usually indicates O-H or N-H stretching. But wait, another peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ suggests a carbonyl group (C=O), like a ketone, aldehyde, or carboxylic acid. The 1610 and 1450 cm⁻¹ regions might be aromatic C=C stretches. So, putting this together, the compound probably has an aromatic ring, a carbonyl group, and maybe an O-H group, but wait, 3400–2500 is a broad region. If it were an alcohol, the O-H stretch would typically be around 3300-3500, but broad. Alternatively, maybe an amine? But I don't see any NMR peaks that would suggest amine protons.

Wait, red phosphorus and HI—what kind of reaction is that? Oh, right, that's the Hunsdiecker reaction? Or maybe a substitution. Alternatively, red phosphorus is often used in the preparation of ylides, like in the formation of alkenes via the Wittig reaction. Oh wait, wait. When a carboxylic acid is treated with red phosphorus and HI, it can undergo a reaction to form an acid chloride, right? Or, perhaps more accurately, it's used to convert carboxylic acids to acyl chlorides. Wait, no. Alternatively, maybe the acidic hydrogen is being abstracted. Hmm.

Wait, if the compound has a carbonyl and an O-H, perhaps it's a carboxylic acid. Because the IR at 1720 cm⁻¹ is a strong peak, which aligns with a carboxylic acid's O-H and C=O. Alternatively, an ester or ketone. But the O-H at 3400–2500 might be from an alcohol or a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but in the NMR, the 10.5 ppm is a broad singlet integrating for 1H. That's really high. For a proton NMR, 10.5 is quite upfield for a phenolic O-H, but more likely to be an acidic proton, like a carboxylic acid. Because in phenol, the O-H is usually around 5-7 ppm, but broad. Alternatively, if it's an aldehyde proton, that's around 9-10 ppm. But the 10.5 is a bit higher, and aldehyde protons are usually around there but maybe a bit lower. Also, aldehydes have a strong IR peak around 1700-2800 (the C-H stretch is around 2800-2700, with a strong absorption). But the IR data given doesn't show a strong peak around 2800. Wait, the IR given has 3400–2500, which is a broad region. So maybe it's an O-H stretch for a carboxylic acid.

So putting this together, maybe Compound X is a benzoic acid derivative. The NMR has aromatic protons, so let's look at those. The aromatic region in the NMR: 8.0 ppm (d, 2H), 7.2 ppm (d, 2H). That's a classic pattern for a para-substituted benzene. The doublets suggest coupling between adjacent protons. So if the substituent is in the para position, then the two protons on each adjacent carbon would be equivalent, giving two doublets. So that's a good sign that the compound has a para-substituted benzene ring.

So, perhaps the structure is something like a para-substituted benzene with a substituent that includes a carbonyl group. Let's look at the rest of the NMR.

The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) is a multiplet, maybe a CH adjacent to something. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be a CH2 group. The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is a triplet, which is probably a CH3 attached to a CH (since a doublet of 3H is typically a methyl group attached to something else). The 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) is a triplet, likely a terminal CH3 in an ethyl group.

Putting this together: the substituent on the benzene could be a group like -CH2-C(O)OH, but let's see. Alternatively, perhaps a longer chain. Let's think about the structure.

The NMR also has a peak at 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H), which is likely a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH). So that would fit with an aromatic ring having a carboxylic acid substituent. Wait, but then what about the other groups?

Looking at the substituent, if it's a benzene ring with a substituent that includes a carbonyl group and a CH2CH2... Wait, maybe the substituent is a ketone or an ester. Hmm, but the IR has 1720, which could be either an ester or a ketone. But a carboxylic acid would have a lower carbonyl stretch, like around 1700-1720, but if it's an ester, the carbonyl is also around there. Alternatively, a ketone is around 1700-1720 as well.

Wait, but the 10.5 ppm peak is more indicative of a carboxylic acid. So perhaps the substituent is a -COOH group. Let me think. If the substituent is a -COOH, then the para position would have another substituent.

Wait, but in that case, the NMR would show more than just the aromatic protons. Let me reconsider. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a carbonyl group with a chain. Let's think about the NMR.

The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) might be a CH group adjacent to something, like a CH connected to a carbonyl. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be a CH2 group, maybe part of a chain attached to the carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is CH2CH2COOH? No, wait. Let me think about the substituent's structure. The substituent would be something like -CH2-C(O)R, but wait, looking at the NMR signals, perhaps it's a chain like CH2-C(O)-something.

Alternatively, let's think about the substituent as a propionyl group. Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to piece together the structure.

So, the aromatic ring is para-substituted. On the ring, we have two substituents. One is a carbonyl group (from the IR), perhaps a -COOH, and another substituent which is an alkyl group.

Wait, looking at the NMR:

- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): likely a methyl group attached to a CH, maybe as in -CH(CH3)-something.

- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): a terminal methyl group, part of an ethyl chain.

So, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group? Like -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-something? Or maybe a longer chain.

Wait, the 2.9 ppm is a multiplet for 1H. That could be a CH group adjacent to a carbonyl. So, perhaps the substituent is a CH2-CO- group. Let me think: maybe the structure is a benzene ring with a substituent like -CH2-CO-O-R, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: let's count the protons. The aromatic protons are 2H each, so 4H in total, which makes sense for a para-substituted benzene with two substituents. Wait, no, para substitution usually has two substituents. Wait, no, if two substituents are on opposite positions (para), each substituent would have one group. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a single group, making the ring have two substituents in the para positions. Wait, maybe it's a meta substitution? No, the NMR shows two doublets, so likely para.

Wait, no, the aromatic protons are split into two doublets, which usually implies that there are two substituents on the ring, each in the para positions. Or perhaps a single substituent that's in such a position that the adjacent protons are deshielded. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is in the para position, and the aromatic protons are in two different environments, each giving a doublet. So, maybe the substituent is a -COOH group attached to the benzene ring in the para position, and another substituent that's an ethyl group or something similar.

Wait, but how does the rest of the NMR fit into this? Let's see. The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) could be a CH adjacent to a carbonyl. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be a CH2 group perhaps between the ring and the carbonyl. The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) would be a methyl attached to a CH, like a -CH(CH3) group. The 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) is a terminal CH3, so perhaps part of an ethyl group.

Putting this together, the substituent on the benzene could be something like -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-COOH? No, wait. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: the NMR suggests a structure where the substituent is a chain that includes a carbonyl group, a CH, a CH2, and a methyl group. Like maybe a -CH2-C(O)-R group.

Wait, the 2.9 ppm is a multiplet for 1H. That could be a CH adjacent to a carbonyl, so perhaps a ketone. But wait, the IR 1720 could be a ketone. If it's a ketone, the O-H wouldn't be present. Hmm, but the IR shows 3400–2500, which I thought might be O-H, but maybe it's an alcohol or another group. Alternatively, perhaps it's an amine, but I don't see any NMR peaks that fit an NH.

Wait, another possibility: the 10.5 ppm could be an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes have a peak around there. But then the IR would show a strong peak for the C-H stretch around 2800–2700, which I don't see in the provided data. The IR given has 3400–2500, which is a broad region. Maybe that's due to O-H (like an alcohol or carboxylic acid) and possibly other stretches like N-H or C-H in an alkyne, but I don't think so.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a benzaldehyde derivative. But then, why the 1720 peak? Benzaldehyde's carbonyl is around 1700 cm⁻¹, so that fits. But the 10.5 ppm would be the aldehyde proton.

But then, looking at the NMR, the aldehyde proton is typically a triplet around 9-10 ppm, but in this case, it's a broad singlet. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a phenol. The O-H of phenol is around 5 ppm, but the given peak is at 10.5, which is higher. So maybe not.

Wait, going back to the reaction: Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Oh, wait, that's a reaction that's used to prepare acid chlorides. Red phosphorus and HI are typically used in the preparation of acid chlorides from carboxylic acids. For example, when a carboxylic acid is treated with excess HI and red phosphorus, the O-H group is converted to a Cl via an intermediate. So, the reaction would convert a carboxylic acid to an acyl chloride.

So, if X is a carboxylic acid, then upon reaction with red phosphorus and HI, it becomes an acyl chloride.

Wait, but the options don't have an acyl chloride. Let's check the options again.

Options:

A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid

B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene

C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid

D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene

Wait, so options A and C are carboxylic acids. B and D are substituted benzene rings (like toluene derivatives). So if X is a carboxylic acid, and the reaction converts it to an acid chloride, but none of the options are acid chlorides, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, no—maybe the reaction doesn't stop at the acid chloride. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution. Or perhaps another reaction.

Wait, another thought: when a carboxylic acid is treated with red phosphorus and HI, it might form an acid chloride. But then, if the acid chloride then undergoes further reaction, perhaps with something else. Wait, but the question just says it reacts with red phosphorus and HI. So maybe the product is an acyl chloride, but none of the options are that. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution, but that's more when you have leaving groups.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a halogenation. Alternatively, maybe the compound X is an alcohol, and the reaction is a substitution. But I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I should go back to the NMR and figure out the structure of X, then think about the reaction.

Let me try to build the structure. The aromatic ring is para-substituted. Let's imagine two substituents on the ring. One is a carbonyl group (from IR) and another is an alkyl group.

The substituent on the ring is likely a group like -CO-R. Let's see the NMR data again.

The NMR shows:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): maybe a COOH proton.
- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H): aromatic protons.
- 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): aromatic protons.
- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): maybe a CH adjacent to a carbonyl.
- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): maybe a CH2 group.
- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): a methyl attached to a CH.
- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): a terminal methyl.

So, perhaps the substituent is a carbonyl group connected to a CH2CH(CH3)CH2- group?

Wait, alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group attached to the ring via a carbonyl. Like, the ring has a -CO-O-R group? Or perhaps -CO-R.

Wait, if I have a benzene ring with a -CO-R group where R is a sec-butyl group, for example, what would that look like?

The substituent R would be a sec-butyl group. So, the structure would be benzene with a carbonyl group attached, which is then connected to a sec-butyl group. Let me think about the NMR:

- The -CO-R group would have a carbonyl peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ (which matches IR).
- The aromatic protons would be para-substituted, giving two doublets (8.0 and 7.2 ppm, which is typical for a para-substituted benzene with an electron-withdrawing group like -CO-).
- The R group would be a sec-butyl: so, the structure would be CH2-C(O)-Ph and then CH(CH2CH3) perhaps? Wait, no. Let me draw it out.

Wait, the substituent is -CO-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-? No, perhaps it's a propyl chain.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propenoate or something else, but I'm getting stuck. Let me think of the NMR again.

The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) could be the CH2 next to the carbonyl. Wait, no, if it's a ketone, the CH would be next to the carbonyl. Or if it's a carboxylic acid, the CH2 would be next to the COOH.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-C(O)OH group. But then, the IR would have a strong O-H around 2500-3400, which it does. The 1720 would be the C=O of the carboxylic acid.

Wait, but then where do the other NMR signals come in? The 2.9, 1.7, 1.4, and 0.9 ppm.

If the substituent is a -CH2-CH2-COOH group attached to the benzene, then the structure would be benzene with a propionoic acid substituent. But the NMR doesn't show a triplet around 4 ppm for a CH2 next to the COOH.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CO-O-R group, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a -COOCH2CH2CH3 group. But that would be an ester. The 1720 would fit, and the O-H would not be present, but then where would the signals at 2.9, 1.7, etc., come from?

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CO-CH(CH3)2 group? No, that might not fit.

Wait, another thought: the substituent could be a -CH2-CO-CH2-CH(CH2CH3) group. No, maybe that's getting too complicated.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CO-CH(CH3)2 group, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe it's a benzoyl group attached to a chain. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the substituent as a sec-butyl group attached to the ring via a carbonyl. So the substituent is -CO-CH(CH2CH3)CH2-. No, wait, that's a longer chain.

Alternatively, the substituent is a -CO-O-R group, but that would be an ester. Hmm.

Wait, the NMR has a triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H). That's a typical ethyl group. The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is a methyl attached to a CH. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) is a CH2 group. The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) is a CH.

Putting this together, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- group. Wait, that would make a propyl group with a methyl branch. So, perhaps it's a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- group attached to the ring via the carbonyl.

Wait, but then the carbonyl would be at the end of a chain. So the structure would be benzene ring with a substituent like -CO-CH2-CH(CH3)2? Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CO-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group, making a longer chain.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a -CO-CH2-CH(CH3)2 group, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CO-CH2- group, but that doesn't seem to fit the NMR.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a propionyl group attached to a branched alkyl chain. Let me think.

The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) could be the CH next to the carbonyl. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be the CH2 group attached to the CH. The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is a methyl attached to the CH. The 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) is a methyl at the end of a CH2, which would make an ethyl group. So the substituent would be: benzene ring connected to a carbonyl group, then a CH group, then a CH2, then a CH(CH3), then a CH2CH3.

Wait, that would make the structure: Ph-CO-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3. But wait, that's a bit long. Let me count the carbons.

Ph-CO-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3 would have a substituent of -CO-CH2-CH(CH3)CH2CH3. Wait, but that's a pentyl group attached through a carbonyl, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CO-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group. Wait, but that would make the structure:

Ph-CO-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH3? No, I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, maybe it's a -CO-CH2-CH(CH3)2 group. That would be:

Ph-CO-CH2-CH(CH3)2. So, the substituent is a neopentyl group attached via a carbonyl. But then, the NMR would show a CH2 next to the carbonyl, a CH, and some methyl groups.

Wait, in that case, the NMR would have peaks for the CH2 next to the carbonyl (maybe around 2.5 ppm?), but the given NMR has 2.9 ppm for 1H. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CO-O-R group, but I don't have an O in the NMR.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a -CH2-CH2-COOH group, but that would make the structure Ph-CH2-CH2-COOH. Then, the NMR would show a triplet around 3.5 ppm for the CH2 next to the COOH, but I don't see that. Alternatively, perhaps the chain is longer.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a -CH2-CO-CH(CH3)2 group, but that seems complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group, but I'm not seeing how the NMR fits.

Wait, another thought: the substituent may be a benzyl group. But I don't see any signals in the NMR that would suggest a benzyl group.

Wait, perhaps it's a methyl group attached to the ring, and another substituent. Let me think: the 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is a methyl attached to a CH. So, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH3)- group attached to the ring via a carbonyl.

So, the structure would be Ph-CO-CH(CH3)-R, where R is something else.

Wait, but then the 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) could be the CH group, the 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be a CH2 connected to that CH, and the 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) could be a terminal methyl. So perhaps the substituent is a -CO-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3 group. That would make a pentyl group attached to the ring via a carbonyl.

But wait, the NMR only has 1H at 2.9, 2H at 1.7, 3H at 1.4, and 3H at 0.9. That adds up to 6H in the substituent, which would be:

Ph-CO-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3.

But that would give a substituent of -CO-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3, which is a 4-membered chain. But in the NMR, the CH2 groups would split into different signals.

Wait, maybe it's a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- group attached to the carbonyl. So, the substituent would be -CO-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3.

Let me think about the NMR for that substituent:

- The carbonyl would be at 1720 cm⁻¹.
- The -CO-CH2- group would have a CH2 adjacent to the carbonyl. The protons on CH2 would be around 2.5-2.8 ppm as a quartet or triplet. But the NMR shows 2.9 ppm as a multiplet for 1H, which is a CH, not CH2.

Hmm, perhaps that's not the structure.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a -CO-CH(CH2CH2CH3)- group. So, the substituent would be a branched chain.

But I'm getting stuck on this part. Maybe I should think about the possible options and see which structure fits the NMR.

Looking at the options:

Option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

So, the structure would be benzoic acid with a sec-butyl group in the para position.

Benzoic acid is Ph-COOH. The substituent would be a sec-butyl group. Wait, but benzoic acid is Ph-COOH. If the substituent is a sec-butyl group attached to the ring, then the structure would be Ph-(COOH) and Ph-(sec-butyl), but wait, no. Benzoic acid has the COOH group on the ring. If the substituent is a sec-butyl group, then it's in the para position relative to the COOH.

In that case, the NMR would show:

- Aromatic protons as two doublets (since para-substituted), which matches the NMR.
- The substituent would be a sec-butyl group: Ph-COOH with a -CH2-CH(CH3)2 group in the para position.

Wait, no. The substituent on the ring would be the sec-butyl group, and the COOH would be in another position. Wait, no, because the COOH is in the para position.

Wait, the structure of option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So, the benzoic acid has a sec-butyl substituent in the 4-position.

So, the structure is:

Ph-COOH where the phenyl group has a sec-butyl group in the para position relative to the COOH.

Wait, but then the substituent would be a sec-butyl group attached to the ring.

So, the substituent is -CH2-CH(CH3)2. No, wait, a sec-butyl group is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-.

Wait, no, the structure of a sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH2CH3)-. Wait, no. Wait, the structure of a sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH3)CH2-.

Wait, no. Let me clarify. The sec-butyl group is a four-carbon chain where the substituent is attached to the second carbon. So the structure is CH2CH(CH2CH3)-.

Wait, no, the correct structure of a sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH3)CH2-, but wait, that's a three-carbon chain. Wait, no: butyl is four carbons. So, a sec-butyl group would be CH2CH(CH2CH3)-, but that's confusing. Wait, maybe it's better to think that the substituent is -CH2CH(CH3)CH2-.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the substituent wrong. Let me think: the substituent is a sec-butyl group, which is a four-carbon chain with the point of attachment on the second carbon. So, it would be:

CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH3.

Wait, no, that's a neopentyl group. Wait, no, the correct structure of a sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH2CH3)2? No, that doesn't sound right.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a isobutyl group, which is CH2CH(CH3)2. That's a three-carbon group, but in the case of isobutyl, the substituent is on the second carbon of a four-carbon chain.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is an isobutyl group. In that case, the structure would be Ph-COOH with an isobutyl group in the para position.

So, the substituent would be -CH2CH(CH3)2.

Then, looking at the NMR:

- The aromatic protons would be as given, with two doublets.
- The substituent's protons would be: the CH2 group next to the ring (attached to the CH(CH3)2), and the CH(CH3)2 group.

But the NMR shows a triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H), which would be the terminal methyl group of an ethyl chain. So, the substituent has a CH2CH3 group.

Wait, if the substituent is an isobutyl group, which is -CH2CH(CH3)2, then the NMR would show:

- The CH2 group attached to the ring: perhaps a quartet around 1.4 ppm (but that's the d, 3H in the NMR, which is a methyl group).
- The CH(CH3)2 group: the CH would be a septet? Or not, because the coupling would be more complex.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Let me think about the NMR again.

The NMR data is as follows:

1H NMR:
10.5 ppm (bs, 1H)
8.0 ppm (d, 2H)
7.2 ppm (d, 2H)
2.9 ppm (m, 1H)
1.7 ppm (m, 2H)
1.4 ppm (d, 3H)
0.9 ppm (t, 3H)

So, the 0.9 is a triplet (3H), which is likely a -CH2CH2- group, specifically a terminal methyl.

The 1.4 ppm is a doublet (3H), which suggests a methyl attached to a CH group, perhaps as in -CH(CH3)-.

The 2.9 ppm is a multiplet (1H), which could be a CH adjacent to a carbonyl or some other electronegative group.

The 1.7 ppm is a multiplet (2H), maybe a CH2 group.

Putting this together, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2CH3 group attached to the ring via a carbonyl.

Wait, that would make the substituent -CO-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2CH3.

In that case, the NMR would show:

- The -CH(CH3) group's CH as the 2.9 ppm (m, 1H).
- The adjacent CH2 would be around 1.7 ppm (m, 2H).
- The next CH2 (if any) would have a triplet or something, but the 0.9 ppm is the terminal CH3.

Wait, but that would make the substituent a pentyl group attached via a carbonyl, which is a bit long. Alternatively, perhaps it's a propyl group.

Another possibility: the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- group attached via a carbonyl.

So, the structure would be Ph-CO-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3.

In that case, the substituent is a pentyl group attached via a carbonyl, but that's a five-carbon chain. Hmm.

Wait, but the NMR has only 3H at 0.9 ppm (a terminal methyl), 3H at 1.4 (a methyl attached to a CH), 2H at 1.7 (a CH2), and 1H at 2.9 (a CH). That adds up to 9H in the substituent (excluding the aromatic). Wait, but the substituent would be -CO-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, which has 4 carbons in the substituent (excluding the CO). So, the substituent has 4 carbons, which would account for 8 H (but maybe some are in the aromatic region). Hmm, perhaps not.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CO-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2- group, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: maybe the substituent is a propyl group attached via a carbonyl. For example, Ph-CO-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. But the NMR would then have a triplet for the CH2 next to the carbonyl, but the NMR shows 2.9 (m, 1H), which is a CH.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a -CO-CH2-CH(CH3)2 group, but that would make the CH2 next to the carbonyl, and the CH(CH3)2.

In that case, the NMR would show:

- The CH2 next to CO at around 2.5 ppm as a quartet.
- The CH(CH3)2 would have a septet, but that's not present here.
- The methyl groups on the CH(CH3)2 would be a triplet around 1.4 ppm (but we have a doublet at 1.4).

Hmm, not matching.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CO-CH(CH2CH2CH3)- group. So, the CH would be at 2.9 ppm, the CH2 would be at 1.7, and the terminal methyl at 0.9.

In this case, the substituent would be -CO-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-.

But then, the CH2CH2CH3 would be a propyl group attached to the CH.

Wait, but that would make the substituent: -CO-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-, which would require the CH to be connected to a propyl group.

But the NMR doesn't show a triplet for the CH2 adjacent to the CH.

Wait, perhaps it's -CO-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH3.

In that case, the substituent is a -CO-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH3.

So, the CH would be at 2.9 ppm, the adjacent CH2 (from CH2CH3) would be at 1.7, and the terminal CH3 at 0.9.

But then, where is the 1.4 ppm (d, 3H)? Oh, wait, that would be the methyl group on the CH2CH3, which would be a triplet around 1.4 ppm. But in the NMR, it's a doublet, which suggests it's attached to a CH, not a CH2.

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let's think again.

If the substituent is a -CO-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2CH3 group, then the CH(CH3) would be at 2.9 ppm, the adjacent CH2 would be at 1.7 (maybe as a quartet), and the terminal CH3 would be at 0.9 ppm.

But then, where does the 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) come from? That would imply a methyl group attached to a CH, which in this structure is the CH(CH3). So, the CH(CH3) would have a triplet for the methyl group, but in the NMR it's a doublet. Hmm, that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CO-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- group. Then, the CH2 next to CO would be at around 2.5 ppm, the CH(CH3) would be at 2.9 ppm, and the next CH2 would be at 1.7 ppm, ending with a CH3 at 0.9 ppm.

But the NMR shows 1.4 ppm as a doublet, which would be a methyl attached to a CH. So, perhaps the substituent is a -CO-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3 group.

In that case, the CH(CH3) would be at 2.9 ppm, the adjacent CH2 at 1.7 ppm, and the next CH2 at a lower ppm, but the terminal CH3 is at 0.9 ppm.

But then, where is the 1.4 ppm signal? It would have to come from another methyl group. But in this structure, the only methyl is the one attached to the CH(CH3), which is at 1.4 ppm as a doublet. That fits, because the CH(CH3) would have a methyl group attached, which would be a doublet due to coupling with the CH.

So, putting this together, the substituent would be a -CO-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3 group attached to the benzene ring.

Thus, the structure of Compound X would be:

Phenyl group with a -CO-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3 substituent in the para position.

Wait, but the substituent would be a pentyl group attached via a carbonyl. But looking at the options, none of them seem to match this. Let's see the options again.

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So, the structure is Ph-COOH with a sec-butyl group in the para position.

The substituent here would be a sec-butyl group, which is -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-.

Wait, no, the structure of a sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH2CH3)-. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, another approach: let's look at the reaction. Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. If X is a carboxylic acid, then the reaction converts it to an acyl chloride. But the options don't show an acyl chloride. So, perhaps the product after this reaction is an alkyl chloride.

Wait, but how? Red phosphorus and HI can also be used in the preparation of ylides, which can then undergo Wittig reactions. Alternatively, when a carbonyl group is present, the reaction could form a ylide.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

If X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C), then treating it with red phosphorus and HI would convert the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) into an acid chloride (-COCl). But then, the product would be 4-(sec-butyl)benzoyl chloride. However, none of the options are acid chlorides. So perhaps the reaction goes further.

Alternatively, perhaps the acid chloride is treated with a base or another reagent. But the question only mentions reacting with red phosphorus and HI, so perhaps the product is the acid chloride, but that's not an option.

Wait, but looking at the options, perhaps the product is a substitution. Wait, if the substituent is a sec-butyl group attached to the ring, and the reaction doesn't affect that, but maybe the reaction is converting the COOH into something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is converting the COOH into a chloride, but that's not the case, as that would form COCl, which isn't an option.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So, if X is option C, then after reaction with red phosphorus and HI, it would become 4-(sec-butyl)benzoyl chloride. But that's not an option, so perhaps the reaction is different.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution. Wait, but I don't see a good leaving group in X.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a dehydration. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the reaction is converting the -COOH group into a methyl ester or something else. But again, the options don't include that.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a coupling reaction, but that's more with other reagents.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is not about the substituent but about another part of the molecule.

Wait, another angle: the substituent after reaction. The options are A to D. Let's consider each option.

Option A: 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid.

That's a propanoic acid with a 4-ethylphenyl group attached to the second carbon. The structure would be CH2-COOH attached to the benzene ring, but with an ethyl group in the para position. But the NMR data would have more signals, perhaps.

Option B: 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene. That's a toluene derivative with an isobutyl group and a methyl group in the para position.

Option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. That's benzoic acid with a sec-butyl substituent in the para position.

Option D: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. That's a toluene derivative with a sec-butyl group in the para position relative to the methyl.

So, considering the reaction, if X is a carboxylic acid, and the reaction converts it to an acid chloride, but none of the options have an acid chloride, perhaps the reaction is a different one.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the leaving group is the -OH of the carboxylic acid. But to substitute that, you'd need a good leaving group, which -OH isn't. Unless you convert it to a better leaving group first, like a tosylate, but that's not the case here.

Wait, but red phosphorus and HI can also be used in the Baeyer-Villiger oxidation, but I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a halogenation, like introducing a bromine or iodine, but I don't see any indication of that in the options.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a cleavage of a bond. For example, if the substituent has a carbonyl group, maybe the reaction breaks it down.

Wait, but going back to the NMR of X, which is the starting material. The aromatic protons are as in a para-substituted benzene. The substituent has a carbonyl group (IR 1720), and the NMR has a peak at 10.5 ppm, which is likely the COOH proton.

So, X is a para-substituted benzoic acid. The substituent is a group that includes an ethyl chain, perhaps.

Looking again at the NMR, the substituent's protons are:

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): a CH adjacent to something electronegative, like a carbonyl.

- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): CH2.

- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): a methyl attached to a CH.

- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): a terminal CH3.

This seems to fit a substituent like -CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-.

So, the substituent would be a -CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2- group attached to the ring via a carbonyl. So the structure would be Ph-CO-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3.

But wait, that's a six-membered substituent, which seems a bit long.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CO-CH(CH3)-CH2- group, making the substituent a propyl group with a methyl branch.

In any case, the substituent would be a butyl group in some form.

Looking back at the reaction: treating with red phosphorus and HI. If X is a carboxylic acid, the reaction would form an acid chloride. But the options don't include an acid chloride. So perhaps the reaction is something else.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the reaction is the formation of an acyl bromide or iodide. But again, the options don't show that.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydration to form an alkene, but that would require a β-hydroxy group, which I don't see in X.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the conversion of the -COOH group into a methyl ester, but again, the options don't show that.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to think of the possible structures.

If the substituent is a sec-butyl group attached to the ring via a carbonyl, making X as 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C), then reacting with red phosphorus and HI would convert the COOH into COCl. But the options don't include COCl. So perhaps the reaction doesn't involve the COOH group.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution on the substituent. If the substituent has a leaving group, but I don't see any in X.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the reaction again.

Red phosphorus and HI are typically used in the preparation of acid chlorides from carboxylic acids. So, if X is a carboxylic acid, the product would be the corresponding acid chloride. But none of the options are acid chlorides, so perhaps the reaction is a different one.

Wait, but what if the reaction leads to the formation of an alkyl iodide? For example, if the substituent has a hydrogen that can be abstracted to form a carbocation, which then reacts with HI.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a Fries rearrangement, but that usually involves aromatic esters and produces phenyl ketones, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a tertiary alcohol, which would react with HI to form an alkyl iodide, but I don't see any O-H in the substituent, except for the COOH.

Wait, another thought: if X is a benzaldehyde derivative with a substituent, and the reaction is a Wittig reaction, but I don't think so because the question doesn't mention any other reagents.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the formation of an acid anhydride, but that's not indicated.

Hmm, perhaps I should focus on the options and see which one fits the NMR and IR data of X, and then see what reaction would lead to that product.

Looking at option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

The structure is a benzoic acid with a sec-butyl group in the para position.

The NMR would show:

- Aromatic protons as two doublets (8.0 and 7.2 ppm), which matches.

- The substituent is a sec-butyl group, which is -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- attached to the ring.

Wait, but the substituent in option C is 4-(sec-butyl), so the substituent is attached to the ring in the para position to the COOH group.

So, the structure is:

Ph-(COOH) with a substituent at the 4-position: -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-.

Wait, but the substituent in option C is a sec-butyl group, which is a four-carbon group attached at the second carbon. So, the substituent would be -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-.

Wait, no, I'm getting confused again. Let me clarify: the substituent is a sec-butyl group, which is a butyl group attached via the second carbon. So, the structure is:

Ph-COOH

|

Ph-(COOH) has a substituent at the 4-position: -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-.

Wait, but that would make the substituent a propyl group with a methyl branch. Hmm.

In any case, the substituent would have a CH2 group adjacent to the ring, then a CH(CH3), then another CH2 group.

The NMR of X would then have:

- The aromatic protons as two doublets.

- The substituent's CH2 groups and CH.

So, the substituent would have:

- CH2 next to the ring: perhaps around 2.5 ppm as a quartet.

- CH(CH3): around 2.9 ppm as a multiplet.

- CH2 further down: around 1.7 ppm as a multiplet.

- The terminal CH3: around 0.9 ppm as a triplet.

Which matches the NMR data given.

So, the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- group attached to the ring, making the substituent a sec-butyl group.

Thus, X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C).

Now, reacting X with red phosphorus and HI. As mentioned earlier, this typically converts carboxylic acids to acid chlorides. So, the product would be 4-(sec-butyl)benzoyl chloride.

But looking at the options, none of them are acid chlorides. So, perhaps I'm missing something here.

Wait, maybe the reaction isn't about the carboxylic acid group but about the substituent. But I can't see any leaving group in the substituent that would undergo substitution with HI.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution on the benzene ring, but I don't see any indication of that in the data.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the reaction is not converting the carboxylic acid group but is instead an elimination reaction. For example, if the substituent has a β-hydroxy group, it could eliminate to form an alkene. But I don't see any hydroxyl protons in the NMR except for the COOH.

Hmm. I'm a bit stuck. But based on the data, X is option C, 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. Reacting it with red phosphorus and HI would form the acid chloride, but since that's not an option, perhaps the reaction is a different one.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the reaction is the formation of an acyl iodide. But again, the options don't include that.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is not about the COOH group but about the substituent. If the substituent has a hydrogen that can be abstracted, like an acidic hydrogen, then HI could protonate it. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution where the COOH is converted into a better leaving group, but I don't see how that would happen.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is converting the COOH into a methyl ester, but the options don't include that either.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is preparing a benzene ring with a better leaving group, but I don't know.

Wait, maybe the reaction is the formation of a benzene iodide, but I don't see how that would happen.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Perhaps I should conclude that X is option C, and the reaction forms the acid chloride, but since that's not an option, perhaps the correct answer is different.

Wait, let me think about the reaction again. Red phosphorus and HI are used in the Hunsdiecker reaction, which converts carboxylic acids to acid chlorides. But another possibility is that the reaction is converting an alcohol to an alkyl iodide. Wait, but in this case, the starting material is a carboxylic acid, so that wouldn't apply.

Wait, unless the substituent has an alcohol group, but in this case, the substituent is a sec-butyl group, which doesn't have an alcohol.

Wait, perhaps the reaction isn't about the substituent but about the COOH group. So, X is a carboxylic acid, and the reaction forms an acid chloride. But none of the options are acid chlorides.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the COOH group is replaced by Cl, but that's not an option either.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the reaction is converting the COOH group into a methoxy group via some mechanism, but I don't see how that would happen with red phosphorus and HI.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a coupling reaction, but again, I don't see the relevance.

Hmm. Given that I'm stuck, perhaps the correct answer is option C, and the reaction is converting the COOH to a chloride, but since the options don't have that, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the reaction is a dehydration, forming an anhydride. But I don't see any di-acid groups in X.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the COOH group is replaced by another group, but without more data, it's hard to say.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the reaction as converting the COOH group into a methyl group. But I don't know how that would happen.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic acyl substitution, but again, not sure.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is preparing a Grignard reagent, but that's done with Mg, not red phosphorus and HI.

Hmm. I'm not making progress here. Let me recap:

- X has a para-substituted benzene ring, a COOH group, and a substituent with a CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- structure.

- Reacting X with red phosphorus and HI likely converts the COOH to COCl.

But since none of the options are acid chlorides, perhaps the correct answer is option C, and the reaction doesn't change the substituent.

Wait, but the question is to identify the final product. So, if X is option C, and the reaction doesn't change it, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is converting the COOH group into a methyl group, but I don't know the mechanism for that.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is forming a benziodide, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the reaction. Let me look up what red phosphorus and HI do.

Upon checking, red phosphorus and HI are used to prepare acid chlorides from carboxylic acids. The reaction is:

R-COOH + PCl5 → R-COCl + POCl3 + HCl

But when using red phosphorus and HI, it's a similar reaction, producing R-COCl.

So, if X is option C (4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid), the product would be 4-(sec-butyl)benzoyl chloride, which isn't an option.

So, perhaps the reaction isn't about the COOH group but about the substituent.

Wait, perhaps the substituent has an alcohol group, but in X's structure, the substituent is a sec-butyl group, which doesn't have an alcohol.

Wait, unless X is a diol or something, but the NMR doesn't suggest that.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a benzyl group with a leaving group, but I don't see that.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a substitution on the substituent. For example, if the substituent has a bromine or iodine, but X doesn't have any in its structure.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a tertiary alcohol, which upon reaction with HI would form an alkyl iodide. But the NMR doesn't show any broad peaks around 1 ppm, which would suggest an alcohol.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an ether, but again, the NMR doesn't show any peaks indicative of that.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Perhaps I should proceed with the assumption that X is option C, and the reaction forms the acid chloride, which isn't an option, so perhaps the correct answer is different.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the reaction isn't about X's functional groups but about the substituent's structure. For example, if the substituent has a hydrogen that can be abstracted, forming a carbocation, which then reacts with HI.

But the substituent in X is a sec-butyl group attached via a carbonyl. So, the structure is Ph-COOH and Ph-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-.

Wait, perhaps the substituent can undergo some kind of elimination or substitution.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a Hofmann degradation, but that typically involves amines.

Hmm. I think I'm stuck and need to make an educated guess.

Given the NMR data, the structure fits option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. Reacting with red phosphorus and HI would convert the COOH to COCl, but since that's not an option, perhaps the reaction is different. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution on the substituent, but I can't see how.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is converting the COOH to a methyl group via some mechanism, but I don't know.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a coupling, and the product is an ester, but again, the options don't show that.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution on the benzene ring, but that's unlikely.

Hmm. Perhaps the correct answer is option C, and the reaction is converting the substituent in some way, but I can't see it. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in identifying X.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the substituent in X is a propyl group attached via a carbonyl, making it a benzoyl propionate. But that's not one of the options.

Wait, perhaps X is option A: 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid. The structure would be CH2-COOH attached to a benzene ring which has an ethyl group in the para position.

In that case, the substituent would be a CH2 group attached to the ring, and the COOH would be on the same carbon as the CH2.

But the NMR would then have a triplet for the CH2 next to the COOH, but I don't see that in the given data.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group, but I'm not sure.

Given that I'm stuck, I'll make a conclusion based on the NMR data pointing to option C, and the reaction converting the COOH to COCl, but since that's not an option, perhaps the correct answer is D.

Wait, option D is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene, which is a toluene derivative with a sec-butyl group in the para position and a methyl group in the 1-position. Wait, but that would have more substituents than the NMR suggests.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction converts the COOH group into a methyl group, making the structure a toluene derivative. But I don't know the mechanism for that.

I think I've spent enough time on this. Based on the NMR and IR data, I believe X is option C, 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. Reacting it with red phosphorus and HI would produce the acid chloride, but since that's not an option, perhaps the reaction is different. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution, but I can't see how. I'll have to go with option C as the starting material, and the reaction forms something else not listed, but since the options don't include the acid chloride, perhaps the correct answer is option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves identifying the final product of a reaction between Compound X and red phosphorus and HI, based on the IR and NMR data provided for X. The IR data shows peaks at 3400–2500 cm⁻¹ (indicative of an O-H or N-H stretch), 1720 cm⁻¹ (a carbonyl group), and 1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹ (aromatic C=C stretches). The NMR data includes a peak at 10.5 ppm (a broad singlet, likely a carboxylic acid proton), two doublets in the aromatic region at 8.0 ppm and 7.2 ppm (indicative of a para-substituted benzene), and signals at 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), and 0.9 ppm (t, 3H), which suggest a branched alkyl chain.

### Analysis of Compound X:
1. **IR Data**: The 1720 cm⁻¹ peak indicates a carbonyl group, and the 3400–2500 cm⁻¹ region suggests an O-H group, consistent with a carboxylic acid. The aromatic peaks confirm the presence of a benzene ring.
2. **NMR Data**:
   - The aromatic protons at 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H) confirm a para-substituted benzene.
   - The 10.5 ppm peak is characteristic of a carboxylic acid proton.
   - The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), and 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) indicate a branched alkyl chain, likely a sec-butyl group.

From this analysis, Compound X is identified as **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid** (option C), a para-substituted benzoic acid with a sec-butyl group.

### Reaction with Red Phosphorus and HI:
Red phosphorus and HI are typically used to convert carboxylic acids into acid chlorides. When X (4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid) reacts with these reagents, the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is converted into an acid chloride (-COCl), forming **4-(sec-butyl)benzoyl chloride**. However, none of the provided options correspond to an acid chloride.

Given the options, the most plausible conclusion is that the reaction does not alter the substituent on the benzene ring but instead modifies the carboxylic acid group. Since the options do not include an acid chloride, the correct answer must be the starting material, **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid** (option C).

### Critical Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A (2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid)**: This structure does not match the NMR data, as it would not produce the observed splitting pattern for the aromatic protons or the alkyl chain signals.
- **Option B (1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene)**: This is a substituted toluene derivative, which is inconsistent with the carboxylic acid group indicated by the IR and NMR data.
- **Option C (4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid)**: Matches the IR and NMR data, including the para-substituted benzene, the carboxylic acid group, and the sec-butyl substituent.
- **Option D (1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene)**: This is another substituted toluene derivative, which does not match the carboxylic acid group indicated by the IR and NMR data.

### Conclusion:
Based on the spectroscopic data and the reaction conditions, Compound X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid** (option C). The reaction with red phosphorus and HI likely converts the carboxylic acid group into an acid chloride, but since this product is not listed among the options, the correct answer remains the starting material.

Answer: C
