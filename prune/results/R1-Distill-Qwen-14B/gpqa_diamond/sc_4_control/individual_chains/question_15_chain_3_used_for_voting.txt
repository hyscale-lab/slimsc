Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanet transits and which planet is more likely to transit. Hmm, let's think through this step by step.

Alright, the setup is that there are two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. The researchers want to observe the one with the highest probability of transiting because they have limited time. Both were detected via the radial velocity method, so their minimum masses and orbital periods are known.

Wait, both have the same mass. So their masses don't affect the transit probability directly. But their orbital periods are different. Planet_1 has an orbital period three times shorter than Planet_2. So Planet_1 is closer to its star since a shorter period means a closer orbit.

The host stars have the same radii, but Planet_1's star is more massive. Planet_2's star is slightly evolved but same radius. Oh, that's interesting. Same radius but different masses? So the stars have the same size but different masses. I remember that for stars, higher mass usually means larger radius, but in this case, they're the same. Maybe Planet_1's star is more massive but hasn't expanded yet, while Planet_2's is a bit evolved but not enough to change the radius much.

The question is about the probability of a transit. I think the transit probability depends on the alignment of the planet's orbit with our line of sight. But there's another factor: the size of the planet relative to the star, and the orbital distance. Wait, no, the probability also depends on the orbital inclination, which is more about the geometry. But I think the main factors are the size of the planet compared to the star and the size of the orbit.

Wait, no, wait. The probability of a transit is actually a function of the star's radius, the planet's orbital radius, and the planet's size. Oh right, the formula for the transit probability is roughly (R_planet / R_star)² multiplied by some geometric factor. But I think the key thing here is that the probability is proportional to (R_planet / R_star)² * (1 / a), where a is the orbital radius. Or is it just the (R_p/R_s)^2 term?

Wait, no. The probability is more about the alignment. The transit probability is given by the formula:

P ≈ (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (1 - e²))^(3/2)

But wait, here the orbits are circular, so e=0. So the second term is just 1. So the probability simplifies to (R_p / R_s)^2. But wait, that's the same for both planets, right? Because the question says both planets are Earth-like, so their radii are the same as Earth. And the host stars have the same radius. So (R_p / R_s)^2 would be the same for both.

Wait, but wait. No, no. The transit probability isn't just that. Because the planet needs to pass directly in front of the star as seen from Earth. The probability is higher if the planet's orbit is more likely to be edge-on, which depends on the inclination. But assuming that the RV method has already found the planets, and their RV data gives us their minimum mass, which implies that their true mass is higher than or equal to the minimum. But in terms of transit probability, it's more about the orbital geometry.

Wait, I think I'm getting confused. Let me recall. The transit probability for a given planet around a star is given by:

P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (1 - e²))^(3/2) * (1 / (sqrt(1 + (a/R_s)^2))) )

No, no, I think I'm mixing it up. Alternatively, the transit probability is the probability that the orbital plane is aligned such that the planet passes in front of the star from our viewpoint. The probability is given by:

P ≈ (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / a) * (some constants).

Wait, no. Let me think again. The transit probability (the chance that the planet's orbit is aligned to cause a transit) is approximately (R_star + R_planet) / a, but more accurately, it's (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1 / (1 + a/R_s)) ), but that's getting complicated. Alternatively, another approach is that the probability is proportional to (R_p / a)^2. Because for a given star, a planet with a larger orbit is less likely to transit because the area it can block is smaller. Wait, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, the formula I remember is that the transit probability is proportional to (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1 / (a / R_s)) ), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, I think the transit probability is given by:

P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * [ (1 / (sqrt(1 + (a_p / R_s)^2)) ) ]

Hmm, that's getting a bit complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the transit probability is simply (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1 / a_p), but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, another approach: the transit probability is given by the ratio of the area of the star to the area of the sphere that the planet's orbital plane presents to us. The area of the star is π R_s². The area where the planet can transit would be the cross-section of the orbital plane, which is π (a_p)^2. So the probability is (R_s)^2 / (a_p)^2. But that would be (1 / (a_p/R_s)^2). Wait, that would make P = (R_s^2 / a_p^2). But if a_p is in the same units as R_s?

Wait, no. Because a_p is the semi-major axis, which is much larger than R_s. So the probability is approximately (R_s / a_p)^2. Because the planet has a small chance of passing in front of the star, so the probability is proportional to (R_s / a_p)^2.

Wait, but if the probability is (R_s / a_p)^2, then for a given star, a planet with a smaller a_p (closer in) has a higher chance, because a_p is smaller. So (R_s / a_p) is larger, so P is higher.

But in this problem, the planets have different a_p. Let's see: Planet_1 has a shorter orbital period than Planet_2. Since orbital period is related to a_p via Kepler's third law.

Kepler's third law: P² = (4π²/G(M)) a³, where M is the mass of the star plus the planet. But since the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's (both are Earth-like, so M_planet << M_star), we can approximate P² ≈ (4π²/(G M)) a³.

So a³ = (G M P²)/(4 π²)

Thus, a is proportional to (M * P²)^(1/3).

So for Planet_1 and Planet_2:

M_1 = 2 * M_2 (since M_1 is twice that of M_2)

P_1 = P_2 / 3 (since Planet_1's period is three times shorter)

So, for a_1:

a_1 proportional to (M_1 * P_1²)^(1/3) = (2 M_2 * (P_2² / 9)) )^(1/3) = ( (2/9) M_2 P_2² )^(1/3 )

a_2 proportional to (M_2 * P_2² )^(1/3 )

So a_1 / a_2 = [ (2/9) / 1 ]^(1/3 )

Wait, compute that: (2/9)^(1/3) is approximately (0.222)^(1/3) ≈ 0.6. So a_1 is about 0.6 times a_2.

Wait, let me compute it more accurately. 2/9 is approximately 0.2222. The cube root of 0.2222 is about 0.6 because 0.6^3 is 0.216, which is close to 0.222. So a_1 ≈ 0.6 a_2.

So a_1 is smaller than a_2, meaning Planet_1 is closer to its star.

Now, back to the transit probability. I thought the probability is proportional to (R_s / a_p)^2. Since both stars have the same radius (R_s is same for both), the planet with the smaller a_p (Planet_1) has a higher probability.

Because for Planet_1: (R_s / a_1)^2 = (R_s / (0.6 a_2))^2 = (R_s/a_2)^2 * (1/0.6)^2 ≈ (R_s/a_2)^2 * 2.778.

So Planet_1's transit probability is about 2.778 times higher than Planet_2's.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again: if a_1 is 0.6 a_2, then (R_s/a_1)^2 = (R_s/(0.6 a_2))² = (1/(0.6))² * (R_s/a_2)^2 = approx 2.78 * (R_s/a_2)^2.

So Planet_1's transit probability is higher. So the researchers should choose Planet_1.

But wait, I thought the transit probability formula was (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (R_s / a_p)^2, but I'm getting a bit confused because both stars have same radius. So if both R_p and R_s are same, then (R_p/R_s)^2 is same. Then the rest is (R_s/a_p)^2.

Wait, no. The transit probability is (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1 / (a_p / R_s)) ) ?

Wait, no, I think it's (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1 / (a_p / R_s)), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, I think the transit probability is (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1 / (sqrt(a_p² + R_s²) / R_s )) ) which would be another factor, but this is getting complicated.

Alternatively, the correct formula for the transit probability is:

P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (1 + (a_p / R_s)^2 )^(1/2) )

Wait, that seems more accurate. Because the planet must pass in front of the star, and the area it can cover is a circle of radius R_p, but the star's radius is R_s. The probability is (R_p^2) / ( (R_s + a_p )^2 + ... ) No, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, another approach: the probability that the planet transits is roughly equal to the ratio of the area of the star as seen from the planet's position, compared to the area of the celestial sphere. Wait, no, perhaps not.

Alternatively, the transit probability is approximately (R_p / a_p)^2. Because from Earth's perspective, the angular size of the star is R_s / a_p (parallax), and the planet's angular size is R_p / a_p. So the chance that the planet's disk covers part of the star's disk is proportional to (R_p / a_p)^2.

Wait, that makes sense. So the probability is (R_p / a_p)^2.

Because if the planet is far away (larger a_p), the probability of blocking part of the star is lower. So if a_p is small, (R_p/a_p) is larger, so higher probability.

Since both planets have the same R_p, and same R_s, but a_p is different.

So, the transit probability is proportional to (R_p / a_p)^2.

So, for Planet_1, a_p is smaller than Planet_2's a_p.

Because a_1 = 0.6 a_2.

So, (R_p/a_1)^2 = (R_p/(0.6 a_2))² = (1/(0.6))² * (R_p/a_2)^2 ≈ 2.778 * (R_p/a_2)^2.

So, Planet_1's transit probability is approximately 2.778 times higher than Planet_2's.

But wait, wait. Let me make sure. Because I think I might have confused a_p with a different factor.

Wait, perhaps the transit probability is proportional to (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (R_s / a_p). Hmm, because the area of the star is π R_s², and the area where the planet could block the star is the cross-section, which is π (R_p)^2. But in terms of solid angle, the probability is (R_p^2) / (a_p^2), because the solid angle is π R_p² / (4π a_p²) ) = R_p²/(4 a_p²) ), but the actual formula for the transit probability might be (R_p / a_p)^2 multiplied by (R_s / R_sun)^2 or something else.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the correct formula. From what I remember, the probability of a transit is given by:

P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (1 + (a_p / R_s)^2 )^(1/2) )

But wait, another source says that the transit probability is approximately (R_p / R_s)^2. Because the planet must pass in front of the star, which has a certain area. So the chance is proportional to the area of the planet relative to the star. But then, that would ignore the orbital distance, which doesn't make sense because planets further away have a lower chance.

Wait, maybe I'm wrong. Let me think again. The transit probability is the probability that the planet's orbital plane is aligned such that it passes in front of the star. The formula is:

P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (a_p)) ) * some factor. Or perhaps it's (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by the solid angle.

Alternatively, I've found that the transit probability is (R_p / a_p)^2 * (R_s / R_p)^2? No, that seems circular.

Wait, actually, I think the correct formula is:

P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (1 + (a_p / R_s)^2 )) )

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the transit probability is:

P ≈ (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (a_p)) )

But I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should approach this differently. Let's instead think about the ratio of the probabilities for Planet_1 and Planet_2.

Let’s denote:

P1 = transit probability for Planet_1.

P2 = transit probability for Planet_2.

We need to find P1/P2.

We know that both R_p are the same, and R_s is same for both stars.

Assuming that the transit probability is proportional to (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / a_p).

Because if you have a planet at a larger a_p, it's less likely to transit, so the probability would decrease.

So, P1 ∝ (R_p1^2 / R_s^2) * (1/a1 )

Similarly, P2 ∝ (R_p2^2 / R_s^2 ) * (1/a2 )

But R_p and R_s are the same for both, so P1/P2 = (1/a1) / (1/a2) ) = a2 / a1.

From earlier, a1 = 0.6 a2.

So a2/a1 = 1/0.6 ≈ 1.6667.

So P1 is about 1.6667 times higher than P2. So Planet_1 has a higher probability.

Looking at the options:

Option C says Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability.

Option D says ~2.7 times.

Hmm. So according to this, the ratio is 1.666..., which is ~1.67, so option C is about 1.65, which is close.

But wait, earlier when I thought about a1 being 0.6 a2, the (R_p/a_p) ratio for Planet_1 is (R_p / (0.6 a2)) = (1/0.6) (R_p/a2) = 1.6667 (R_p/a2). So (R_p/a_p)^2 is (2.778) (R_p/a2)^2.

If the transit probability is (R_p / a_p)^2, then P1 is 2.778 times P2. But earlier I thought that the probability is proportional to (R_p/a_p)^2.

Wait, this is confusing. Let's try to clarify.

If transit probability P = (R_p / a_p)^2, then for a1 =0.6 a2:

P1 = (R_p/(0.6 a2))² = (1/(0.6))² * (R_p/a2)^2 = (2.7778) * (R_p/a2)^2.

So P1 = 2.7778 * P2.

Which would make Planet_1's probability about 2.78 times higher than Planet_2's.

Which would correspond to option D.

But earlier I thought the ratio was a2/a1, but that was under the assumption that transit probability is proportional to 1/a_p.

So which is the correct formula?

Hmm, perhaps the correct formula is P ≈ (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / a_p) * (something else).

Wait, I found a source that says the transit probability is approximately (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1 / (sqrt(1 + (a_p / R_s)^2 )) ), but given that a_p >> R_s, this approximates to (R_p / R_s)^2 * (R_s / a_p).

So in that case, the probability is proportional to (R_p R_s) / (R_s^2 a_p) ) = R_p/(R_s a_p).

Wait, that would make P proportional to (R_p) / (R_s a_p).

But in this problem, R_p and R_s are the same for both planets, so the ratio P1/P2 would be (1/(a1)) / (1/(a2)) ) = a2 / a1.

Which is the same as I calculated earlier, 1.6667.

So that leads to P1 being 1.6667 times higher than P2.

So in this case, it's about 1.67 times, which is close to option C's 1.65.

But wait, the earlier approach where a_p is calculated using Kepler's law led to a1=0.6 a2.

So P1/P2 = a2/a1 = 1/0.6 = 1.666..., so 1.666 times, which is approx 1.67.

So the correct ratio is around 1.67, so option C.

But another approach, where the probability is (R_p/a)^2, leads to a higher ratio of 2.78, which is option D.

I'm getting conflicting conclusions based on which formula I use.

Hmm, perhaps I should look for more precise reasoning.

Another approach: the transit probability is the probability that the planet's orbit is aligned so that it passes in front of the star from our line of sight. The probability is equal to the ratio of the star's radius to the orbital distance, squared. So P = (R_s / a_p)^2.

Wait, no, that would imply that as a_p increases, the probability decreases, which makes sense.

But wait, no. Let me think: the planet has a certain orbital radius a_p. The chance that it transits is proportional to the area of the star divided by the area of the planet's orbital disk.

The star's area is π R_s².

The planet's orbital disk area is π a_p².

So the probability is (π R_s²) / (π a_p²) ) = (R_s/a_p)^2.

Wait, but that can't be right because if a_p is large, (R_s/a_p)^2 approaches zero, which makes sense: the probability is very low.

So in this model, P = (R_s / a_p)^2.

But in our case, R_s is the same for both stars, so P1 = (R_s/a1)^2 and P2 = (R_s/a2)^2.

So the ratio P1/P2 = (a2/a1)^2.

We found earlier that a1 = 0.6 a2.

So a2/a1 = 1/0.6 ≈ 1.6667.

So (a2/a1)^2 = (1.6667)^2 ≈ 2.7778.

So P1 is about 2.7778 times P2.

Which would make option D correct.

But wait, this approach leads to a different conclusion. So which formula is correct?

Hmm, I'm getting conflicting results here. Let me try to think of it in another way.

The transit occurs when the planet's orbital plane is edge-on. The probability is the ratio of the area where the planet can cause a transit (i.e., the area of the star) to the area of the sphere that the planet's orbit presents to us. The area where transit can happen is π R_s². The area of the sphere is 4π a_p². So the probability is (π R_s²) / (4 π a_p²) ) = R_s²/(4 a_p²).

So the probability P = (R_s^2) / (4 a_p^2) ) = (R_s/(2 a_p))^2.

So P is proportional to (R_s / a_p)^2.

Since R_s is same for both stars, the ratio P1/P2 is (a2/a1)^2.

We have a1 = ( (2 M_2) * (P1)^2 )^(1/3) / (M_2 (P2)^2 )^(1/3).

Wait, but let's compute a1 and a2 correctly using Kepler's third law.

Kepler's third law is: (P^2) = (4 π^2 G) (M + m) a^3.

Since m << M, we can approximate P^2 = (4 π^2 / (G M)) a^3.

So a^3 = (G M P²) / (4 π^2)

Thus, a is proportional to (M P²)^(1/3).

For Planet_1:

M1 = 2 M2.

P1 = P2 /3.

So a1 ∝ (2 M2 * (P2² /9 ))^(1/3) = (2/9 M2 P2² )^(1/3 ) = (2/9)^(1/3) (M2 P2² )^(1/3 )

a2 ∝ (M2 P2² )^(1/3 )

Thus, a1 / a2 = (2/9)^(1/3 ) ≈ (0.2222)^(1/3) ≈ 0.6.

So a1 = 0.6 a2.

So P1 = (R_s/(2 a1))^2 = (R_s/(2 * 0.6 a2 ))^2 = (R_s/(1.2 a2 ))^2.

P2 = (R_s/(2 a2 ))^2.

So P1/P2 = [ (R_s/(1.2 a2 ))^2 ] / [ (R_s/(2 a2 ))^2 ] = ( (2 a2 )/(1.2 a2 ) )² = (2/1.2)^2 = (5/3)^2 ≈ (1.6667)^2 ≈ 2.7778.

So P1 is about 2.78 times higher than P2.

But according to this, the transit probability for Planet_1 is higher, so the researchers should choose Planet_1.

Looking at the options:

Option D says Planet_1 is preferred due to ~2.7 times higher probability.

So the correct answer would be option D.

Wait, but earlier I thought that the probability is (R_p/a_p)^2, which also led to the same conclusion because a1 was smaller.

So I must have made a mistake in the earlier approach.

Wait, wait, in the previous model where P = (R_p / a_p)^2, but here, P = (R_s / (2 a_p))^2.

So which is correct?

Hmm, perhaps the correct model is P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * (R_s / a_p)^2.

Because the probability is the chance that the planet blocks the star, which depends on both the size of the planet relative to the star and the orbital distance.

So, P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * (R_s / a_p)^2.

So for both planets, R_p and R_s are same, so P is proportional to (1/a_p)^2.

Wait, but that would make P inversely proportional to a_p squared.

Which brings us back to a1 being 0.6 a2, so a_p is smaller, so P is larger.

So P1 is (1/(0.6 a2))^2 = (1/(a2))^2 * 2.7778.

So P1 = 2.7778 P2.

Which again leads to option D.

But earlier in the thought process, I had conflicting results because I was using different formulas. But according to the correct formula, which model is the right one?

I think the correct formula is P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * (R_s / a_p)^2.

So the transit probability is (R_p^2 R_s^2) / (R_s^2 a_p^2) ) = (R_p^2) / (a_p^2).

Wait, that would make P proportional to (R_p/a_p)^2.

So if a_p is smaller, P is higher.

But in that case, Planet_1's a_p is smaller, so P1 is higher.

So P1/P2 = (a2/a1)^2 = (1/0.6)^2 ≈ 2.7778.

Which would make option D correct.

But I'm getting myself more confused. I think I need to find a definitive source.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the transit probability formula.

The correct formula for the transit probability is:

P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * [ (1) / (1 + (a_p / R_s)^2 )^(1/2) ]

But when a_p >> R_s, which is usually the case, this simplifies to:

P ≈ (R_p / R_s)^2 * (R_s / a_p)

So P ≈ (R_p R_s) / ( R_s^2 a_p ) ) = R_p/(R_s a_p )

In this case, since R_p and R_s are same for both, P is inversely proportional to a_p.

So P1 = R_p/( R_s a1 )

P2 = R_p/( R_s a2 )

So the ratio P1/P2 = a2 / a1.

Which we have a1 = 0.6 a2, so a2/a1 = 1/0.6 ≈ 1.6667.

Thus, 1.6667 times higher probability for Planet_1.

Which would correspond to option C (1.65 times).

But wait, this formula is different from the one where P is proportional to (R_s/a_p)^2.

Which is correct?

Hmm, according to the paper I remember, the transit probability for a circular orbit is:

P = (R_p + R_s)/(a_p) ) * [ (R_p + R_s)/(a_p) ) ] 

Wait, no, not that. Let me look for the correct formula.

Upon checking (using my knowledge), the transit probability is approximately (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (R_s / a_p), but I might be mixing up terms.

Wait, another approach: the probability that the planet transits is the ratio of the area of the star to the area of the sphere that the planet's orbit subtends as seen from Earth. So the area of the star is π R_s². The area of the sphere is 4π a_p². The probability is (π R_s²) / (4π a_p²) ) = R_s²/(4 a_p²).

So P = (R_s/(2 a_p ))^2.

Which is (R_s^2 )/(4 a_p^2) ).

So in this case, P is proportional to (R_s/a_p )^2.

In our problem, R_s is same for both planets, so P is inversely proportional to a_p squared.

So P1/P2 = (a2^2)/(a1^2) = (a2/a1 )^2.

As a1 is 0.6 a2, a2/a1 is 1.6667, so (1.6667)^2 = 2.7778.

So P1 is about 2.78 times P2.

So the correct option is D, which states 2.7 times higher.

So the researchers should choose Planet_1, as it has a higher transit probability.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine which planet has the higher probability of transiting, we analyze the transit probability formula. The transit probability for a planet is proportional to:

\[
P \propto \left(\frac{R_p}{R_s}\right)^2 \cdot \frac{1}{a_p}
\]

where \(R_p\) is the planet's radius, \(R_s\) is the star's radius, and \(a_p\) is the planet's orbital semi-major axis. Since both planets have the same \(R_p\) and \(R_s\), the probability depends on \(1/a_p\), meaning planets closer to their stars (\(a_p\) smaller) have higher transit probabilities.

### Step 1: Orbital Distance Ratio
Using Kepler's third law, the semi-major axis \(a_p\) is proportional to:

\[
a_p \propto \left(M \cdot P^2\right)^{1/3}
\]

For Planet_1 and Planet_2:
- \(M_1 = 2M_2\) (Planet_1's star is twice as massive as Planet_2's star).
- \(P_1 = \frac{P_2}{3}\) (Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter).

Substituting into the formula:

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left(\frac{M_1 \cdot P_1^2}{M_2 \cdot P_2^2}\right)^{1/3} = \left(\frac{2 \cdot \left(\frac{P_2}{3}\right)^2}{1 \cdot P_2^2}\right)^{1/3} = \left(\frac{2}{9}\right)^{1/3} \approx 0.6
\]

Thus, \(a_1 = 0.6a_2\), meaning Planet_1 is closer to its star than Planet_2.

### Step 2: Transit Probability Ratio
The transit probability is inversely proportional to \(a_p\). Therefore, the ratio of the transit probabilities is:

\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \frac{a_2}{a_1} = \frac{1}{0.6} \approx 1.67
\]

This means Planet_1 has approximately 1.67 times the transit probability of Planet_2.

### Step 3: Evaluate Options
- **Option A**: Incorrect. Planet_2 is not preferred; Planet_1 has a higher transit probability.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. Planet_2 is not preferred, and the probability ratio is not 1.5.
- **Option C**: Correct. Planet_1 is preferred, and the probability ratio is approximately 1.65, which is close to the calculated value of 1.67.
