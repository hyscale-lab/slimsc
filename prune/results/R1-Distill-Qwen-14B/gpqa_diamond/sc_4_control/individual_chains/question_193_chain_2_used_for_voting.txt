Okay, so I have this astronomy question here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it again. The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over parallax to the fifth power. So, number of stars N is proportional to 1/plx^5. And the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance r. The options are A to D, each with different exponents of r.

Hmm. I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax plx is the reciprocal of distance. So plx = 1/d, where d is the distance. Wait, wait, the formula is plx = 1/(d in parsecs), right? So if the distance increases, the parallax decreases.

So the given relationship is N ∝ 1/plx^5. Let me rewrite that. Since plx is 1/d, then 1/plx is d. So 1/plx^5 would be d^5. Wait, no, wait. Wait, 1/(plx)^5 is the same as (1/plx)^5. But since plx is 1/d, 1/plx is d. So (d)^5. So 1/plx^5 is d^5.

So N is proportional to d^5. But wait, the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range. So if I have a range of distance dr, how does the number of stars in that shell change?

Wait, wait. Oh right, because the number of stars is a function of distance. So if N is proportional to d^5, then the number of stars in a thin shell at a distance d with thickness dr would be the derivative of N with respect to d multiplied by dr. Because as you move a little bit in distance, the number of stars you encounter is the rate of change (density) times the distance interval.

So let's model this. Let me think. Let's say the number of stars is N = k * d^5, where k is some constant. So the number in a thin shell between d and d + dr would be approximately k*(d + dr)^5 - k*d^5. But when dr is very small, this is approximately k * 5 d^4 dr. So the number of stars per unit volume in distance dr is proportional to d^4. Wait no, wait, no. Wait, no, wait. Because when you have a function N(d), the number of stars in a thin shell dr would be dN = dN/dd * dr. But wait, but in 3D space, the volume of a shell is 4π d² dr. So perhaps I'm missing that.

Wait, maybe the question is more about the number density as a function of distance. Let me think again. The problem states that N varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Since plx = 1/d, 1/plx = d. So N ∝ d^5. But wait, that's the number of stars in a region as a function of distance. So for a given region, perhaps it's the surface density, but I'm not exactly sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of stars per unit area (since we're talking about a region of the sky) depends on d^5. Wait, but how? Wait, wait, no. Let me think about flux or something else.

Wait, let me approach this step by step. The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So if plx is p, then N = C / p^5, where C is some constant. But since p = 1/d (in parsecs), N = C d^5.

But wait, that's N as a function of distance. So when d increases, N increases as d^5. But the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance. So in other words, what is the derivative of N with respect to d.

Wait, no. Because the number of stars in a certain volume depends on how many are there. But in this case, the question is per unit range of distance r, which I think refers to the number of stars per unit distance. So maybe it's the density along the line of sight.

Alternatively, perhaps it's the number of stars in a thin shell at radius d with thickness dr. So the number of stars in that shell would be the derivative of N with respect to d times dr.

Wait, but N is proportional to d^5. So dN/dd = 5C d^4. So the number of stars per unit distance dr is 5C d^4 dr. So the number per unit distance is proportional to d^4. But the question is about the number of stars in that region (per unit range of distance r). So the number of stars is proportional to d^4.

Wait, but that's the number per unit distance. So if you have a distance range dr, the number of stars in that range would be 5C d^4 dr. So the number is proportional to d^4 multiplied by dr. So in per unit range, the number is proportional to d^4. But wait, the options don't have d^4 as an option. Wait, the options are in terms of r, which I take as distance. So the question is: how does the number change with distance, per unit range of distance. So perhaps the number in a unit range is proportional to d^4. So the number of stars is proportional to r^4, where r is the distance. So the correct answer would be option C, which is ~ r^4.

Wait, but let me make sure. Let me think about why N would be proportional to d^5. Because parallax p is 1/d, so 1/p^5 is d^5. So if N ∝ 1/p^5, then N ∝ d^5. So if you have a region at a distance d, the number of stars is proportional to d^5. So when you look at how the number changes as you move a small distance dr, the change in N would be dN = (dN/dd) dr = 5 d^4 dr. Hence, the number of stars per unit distance is proportional to d^4. So the number of stars in a small range dr is ~ d^4 dr. So as a function of d (which is r in the options), the number is proportional to r^4. So the correct answer is C, which is r^4.

But wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. Suppose the number of stars per unit area on the sky is proportional to 1/p^5. Since p is 1/d, that would make N ∝ d^5. So when you look at a thin slice (like a shell) at distance d with thickness dr, the number of stars in that shell would be N_shell = (N per unit area) * (area) * dr / (some factor). Wait, no, perhaps not. Because if you have a shell at distance d with thickness dr, the volume of that shell is 4πd² dr. But since we're talking about a specific region of the sky, perhaps it's a differential in solid angle. Hmm, this is getting complicated.

Wait, maybe the initial approach is sufficient. The number of stars N ∝ d^5. So the derivative dN/dr is 5 d^4. So the number of stars per unit distance is proportional to d^4. So the number of stars in a unit distance is r^4. So the correct option is C, which is ~ r^4.

The question states that the number of stars, \( N \), in a specific region of the sky varies with parallax \( \text{plx} \) as \( N \propto 1/\text{plx}^5 \). Since parallax is inversely related to distance (\( \text{plx} = 1/d \), where \( d \) is the distance in parsecs), we can rewrite the relationship as \( N \propto d^5 \). This means the number of stars increases rapidly with distance.

The question asks how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance (\( r \)). To determine this, we consider the derivative of \( N \) with respect to \( d \), which represents the rate of change of the number of stars with distance. Since \( N \propto d^5 \), the derivative is:

\[
\frac{dN}{dd} \propto 5d^4.
\]

This shows that the number of stars per unit distance is proportional to \( d^4 \). Therefore, the number of stars in a thin shell of thickness \( dr \) at distance \( d \) is proportional to \( d^4 \). In terms of \( r \), the number of stars per unit range of distance is proportional to \( r^4 \).

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
