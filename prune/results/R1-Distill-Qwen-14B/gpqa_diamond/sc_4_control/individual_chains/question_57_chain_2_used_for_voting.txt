Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about elastic scattering of electrons from a nuclear target. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question gives several phase shifts: δ₀=90°, δ₁=67°, δ₂=55°, δ₃=30°, and δ₄=13°. Oh wait, the phase shifts are measured, and we're supposed to ignore the rest beyond δ₄? So I guess we only use these five for the calculation.

The task is to find the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. Hmm, I remember that the scattering amplitude f(θ) has both real and imaginary parts, and there's a formula involving Legendre polynomials and phase shifts.

Wait, right! The scattering amplitude f(θ) can be expressed as a sum over the phase shifts multiplied by the corresponding Legendre polynomial evaluated at cosθ, all divided by some factors. The general formula is something like:

f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) Σ ( (2l +1) [δ_l exp(iδ_l) -1 ] P_l(cosθ) )

But wait, since the question is specifically asking for the imaginary part along the incident beam direction, so θ = 0°, right? Because the incident beam is in the direction we're measuring along. So cosθ is 1, because cos(0)=1.

Now, the Legendre polynomial P_l(1) is 1 for all l, because P_l(1) is always 1. Oh right, that's a property of Legendre polynomials. So each term's P_l(1) is 1.

So the formula simplifies for θ=0 to:

Im(f) = (1/(2k)) * Σ ( (2l+1) * Im( δ_l exp(iδ_l) ) ) 

Wait, wait, wait. Because we're taking the imaginary part of f, so we can compute the imaginary part of each term in the sum.

Let me think: δ_l is the phase shift, given in degrees. So each term is (2l+1) multiplied by δ_l exp(i δ_l) -1, but we're only taking the imaginary part.

Alternatively, let me think about the term [δ_l exp(i δ_l) - 1]. The imaginary part of this would be the imaginary part of δ_l exp(i δ_l), because the -1 has no imaginary part.

So Im( [δ_l exp(i δ_l) -1 ] ) = Im( δ_l exp(i δ_l) )

And exp(i δ_l) is cos(δ_l) + i sin(δ_l), so multiplying by δ_l gives δ_l cos(δ_l) + i δ_l sin(δ_l). So the imaginary part is δ_l sin(δ_l).

Wait, no. Wait, the term is [ δ_l exp(i δ_l) - 1 ], so the imaginary part is Im( δ_l exp(i δ_l) ) - Im(1) — but Im(1) is zero. So yes, Im part is δ_l sin(δ_l).

So putting it all together, the imaginary part of f(θ) at θ=0 is:

(1/(2k)) * Σ ( (2l+1) * δ_l sin(δ_l) )

Hmm, but what is k here? Oh, k is the wave number. Wait, in the problem statement, the electrons are 50 MeV. I think we need to calculate k from the electron's momentum.

Wait, the formula for k is k = sqrt( (m_e c²)^2 + (p c)^2 ) / (ħ c). Or wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think. The momentum p is related to the kinetic energy. Oh wait, the electron's energy is given as 50 MeV, but in the lab frame, I suppose.

Wait, no. In the center-of-mass frame, the energy would be higher, but maybe for electrons, which are much lighter than nuclei, the approximation holds that the energy is approximately the kinetic energy. Hmm, but perhaps in this problem, they just give the kinetic energy as 50 MeV. So we can model the electron as having kinetic energy E = 50 MeV.

So, the electron's relativistic energy is E = γ m_e c². But maybe because the energy is 50 MeV and the rest mass of an electron is about 0.511 MeV, the kinetic energy is much larger than the rest mass, so relativistic effects are important.

But perhaps the problem expects us to use the non-relativistic formula for k. Wait, but what's the formula for k in terms of energy? Hmm.

Wait, the momentum p is related to the energy E as E² = (p c)^2 + (m_e c²)^2. So,

p = sqrt( E² - (m_e c²)^2 ) / c² ?

Wait, let's make it clear. The energy E is the total energy, which includes rest mass energy and kinetic energy.

But wait, in the problem, the energy given is 50 MeV, which I think is the kinetic energy. Or is it the total energy? Hmm, the question says "elastic scattering of 50 MeV electrons", which probably refers to their kinetic energy. So, kinetic energy K = 50 MeV.

So the total energy E = K + m_e c². Since m_e c² is about 0.511 MeV, which is much less than 50 MeV, so E ≈ 50 MeV, but including it would make it 50.511 MeV. But maybe the problem expects us to ignore the rest mass since K >> m_e c². So E ≈ 50 MeV.

Then, the momentum p is given by E² = (p c)^2 + (m_e c²)^2. So,

p c = sqrt( E² - (m_e c²)^2 ) ≈ sqrt( (50 MeV)^2 ) ) = 50 MeV.

Wait, but including the rest mass, it's sqrt(50² - 0.511²) ≈ 50. So p c ≈50 MeV. So p ≈ 50 MeV/c.

But wait, what's the expression for k? k is the wave number, given by p/(ħ c) ?

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let's think again. The wave number k is p/(ħ c) ?

Wait, in natural units (ħ = c =1), k would be p. But in regular units, k = p/(ħ c).

Wait, perhaps I should recall that the Compton wavelength is h/(m_e c), and ħ is h/(2π), so ħ c = (h c)/(2π). Therefore, k = p/(ħ c) = (p)(2π)/(h c) ) = (p)/(h/(2π)) ) * (1/c) ?

Hmm, perhaps I should just go through the formula step by step.

The wave number k is given by k = p / (ħ c), where p is the momentum.

But wait, no. Let me think in terms of units.

The momentum p is in MeV/c. Because E = pc for massless particles, but for massive particles, E² = (pc)^2 + (m c²)^2.

So, if E is 50 MeV, then p c = sqrt(E² - (m c²)^2) ≈ 50 MeV. So p = (50 MeV)/c.

So, to find k, which has units of 1/length, we can write:

k = p / (ħ c) )

Wait, but p is in MeV/c, and ħ c has units of MeV fm (since ħ is in MeV s, c is in fm/s, so ħ c is MeV fm).

So, p in MeV/c divided by ħ c (MeV fm) gives (MeV/c) / (MeV fm) ) = 1/(c * fm) * c ) (since c is in fm/s, but when we divide by c, it's canceling?) Hmm, perhaps I should just use the formula numerically.

Wait, the reduced Compton wavelength is ħ c / (m_e c²) ) = ħ/(m_e c) ) ≈ 0.002426 fm (since ħ is about 197.33 MeV fm, and m_e c² is 0.511 MeV. So 197.33 / 0.511 ≈ 386, and 386 MeV fm / (0.511 MeV) ) wait, no, perhaps I'm getting mixed up.

Alternatively, perhaps I should recall that k = (p c )/( ħ c^2 ) ) * something. Hmm, perhaps a better approach is to find k in terms of the given energy.

Wait, let's compute k numerically.

Given that E ≈50 MeV, p c ≈50 MeV.

So, p = 50 MeV / c.

We can compute k = p / (ħ c).

But ħ c is approximately 197.33 MeV fm.

So,

k = (50 MeV / c ) / ( 197.33 MeV fm )

The MeV units cancel. The c in the denominator is in 3e8 m/s, but when we divide by c, let's see:

Wait, let's compute this properly.

k = p / (ħ c) 

p = 50 MeV / c 

ħ c ≈ 197.33 MeV fm 

So,

k = (50 MeV / c ) / (197.33 MeV fm )

The MeV cancels, and the c in the denominator can be written as (c) in denominator, so:

k = (50) / (197.33 * c ) * (1 / fm )

Wait, no. Let me think. Let me write all the units carefully.

p = [50 MeV ] / [c (m/s) ]

ħ c = [197.33 MeV fm ]

So, k = p / (ħ c ) = [ (50 MeV) / (c) ) ] / [197.33 MeV fm ]

The MeV cancels. c is in m/s, fm is 1e-15 m.

So,

k = (50 / (c)) / (197.33 * 1e-15 m )

Wait, no, hold on. Let me convert everything to SI units.

Wait, c is approximately 3e8 m/s.

1 fm is 1e-15 m.

So,

p = 50 MeV / c 

We can convert MeV to joules. 1 MeV = 1.602e-13 J.

So p = (50 * 1.602e-13 J ) / (3e8 m/s )

That's equal to (8.01e-12 J s/m ) / (3e8 m/s ) → wait, no, J is kg m²/s², so J s/m is kg m²/(s² m) ) → kg/(s) m.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for k in terms of the electron's momentum and the reduced Compton wavelength.

The reduced Compton wavelength λ = ħ/(m_e c) ≈ 2.426e-12 m (which is 2.426 fm). So, k = m_e c / ħ = 1 / λ.

So, since λ = ħ/(m_e c), then k = m_e c / ħ.

But wait, p = gamma m_e v. Hmm, perhaps this is getting too complicated. Let me instead recall that k = (p c)/( ħ c² ) * c? I'm not sure. Maybe I should look for a formula that relates energy E to k directly.

Wait, I think the correct formula is:

k = (E² - m_e^2 c^4 )^(1/2) / (ħ c )

Wait, no. Wait, E = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m_e c²)^2 )

So,

(pc)^2 = E^2 - (m_e c²)^2

So,

p c = sqrt( E^2 - (m_e c²)^2 )

Then,

p = sqrt( E^2 - (m_e c^2 )^2 ) / c² ?

Wait, no, p = [ sqrt( E^2 - (m_e c^2 )^2 ) ] / c² ? No, wait:

E² = (p c )² + (m_e c² )²

=> (p c )² = E² - (m_e c^2 )^2

=> p c = sqrt( E^2 - (m_e c^2 )^2 )

So,

p = sqrt( E^2 - (m_e c^2 )^2 ) / c 

So, substituting into k = p/( ħ c ), we get:

k = [ sqrt( E^2 - (m_e c^2 )^2 ) / c ] / ( ħ c )

=> k = sqrt( E^2 - (m_e c^2 )^2 ) / ( ħ c^2 )

But E is 50 MeV, m_e c^2 is 0.511 MeV, so E^2 is much larger than (m_e c^2)^2. So,

k ≈ sqrt( E^2 ) / ( ħ c^2 ) = E / ( ħ c^2 )

Wait, but E is in MeV, and ħ c^2 is in MeV fm (since ħ c is about 197 MeV fm, so ħ c² would be 197 MeV fm squared? No, I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps I should just plug numbers.

Given E ≈50 MeV, m_e c^2=0.511 MeV,

p c ≈ 50 MeV.

So,

k = p / ( ħ c )

But p = (50 MeV ) / c 

So,

k = (50 MeV / c ) / ( ħ c )

= 50 MeV / ( ħ c^2 )

But ħ c is 197.33 MeV fm.

So,

ħ c^2 = 197.33 MeV fm * c 

Wait, no, units need to be compatible. I'm getting stuck on the units here. Maybe I should instead use the formula with E in MeV, and calculate k in terms of 1/fm.

Wait, another approach: The formula for the wave number k is:

k = (m_e c^2 ) / ( ħ c ) ) * beta,

where beta is v/c.

Wait, but beta for high energy electrons is approximately 1. So, perhaps k ≈ (m_e c^2 ) / ( ħ c ) ) * (1) 

m_e c^2 is 0.511 MeV.

So,

k = (0.511 MeV ) / (197.33 MeV fm ) 

= 0.511 / 197.33 fm⁻¹ 

≈ 0.002587 fm⁻¹.

Wait, but that's the rest mass energy contribution. Since the kinetic energy is much larger, how does that come into play?

Alternatively, another formula: For high-energy electrons, E ≈ pc, so p ≈ E / c.

So, k = p / ( ħ c ) ≈ (E/(c)) ) / ( ħ c )

= E / ( ħ c^2 )

Substituting E=50 MeV,

k = 50 MeV / ( 197.33 MeV fm * c ) 

Wait, but c is in units, so perhaps I should express it in terms of 1/c.

Wait, maybe the correct approach is to use the relation:

k = (E)/( ħ c^2 )

But E is in MeV, and ħ c^2 is (197.33 MeV fm ) * c.

Wait, that doesn't make sense dimensionally. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting stuck on the units and should instead just compute it numerically.

Wait, another approach: the Compton wavelength λ = h/(m_e c) = 2π ħ/(m_e c) ≈ 0.002426 fm.

So, the wave number k is 1/λ = 1/(0.002426 fm) ≈ 412.3 fm⁻¹.

But that's for the rest mass. For high energy, the wavelength is given by λ = h/(p), so since p ≈ E/c, λ = h c / E.

So, λ = (12400 eV fm ) / E (in eV),

because hc ≈ 12400 eV fm.

Wait, E is 50 MeV = 5e7 eV.

So,

λ = 12400 / 5e7 = 2.48e-4 fm.

Hmm, but wavelength λ is 2π/k, so k = 2π/λ.

So,

k = 2π/(2.48e-4 fm) ≈ (6.2832) / (2.48e-4 ) fm⁻¹

≈ 6.2832 / 0.000248 ≈ 25337 fm⁻¹.

Wait, that seems very large. But 50 MeV is a high energy, so a small wavelength.

But wait, I think I made a mistake here. Because hc is about 12400 eV·fm, so when E=50 MeV = 5e7 eV,

lambda = (12400 eV fm) / (5e7 eV) ) 

= (12400)/(5e7) fm = 0.000248 fm.

So, k = 2pi / lambda ≈ 2pi / 0.000248 fm 

≈ (6.2832) / 0.000248 ≈ 25337 fm⁻¹.

Hmm, so k is approximately 25337 fm⁻¹.

Wait, but in the previous approach, when I used E=50 MeV and calculated k ≈ E/(ħ c^2 ), that gave a different result.

Wait, perhaps I should just proceed with this k value of about 25337 fm⁻¹.

Wait, but let's make sure. The formula for the de Broglie wavelength is λ = h/(p), and p = gamma m_e v.

But for high energies, gamma is very large, and v≈c.

So, λ ≈ h c/(gamma m_e c²) )

Since E = gamma m_e c²,

λ = h c / E.

So, when E=50 MeV,

lambda = (12400 eV fm ) / (50e6 eV ) ) 

= 0.248 fm.

Wait that can't be, because 12400 /50e6 is 0.000248 fm.

Wait, wait, 50 MeV is 50 million eV? No, 1 MeV is 1e6 eV, so 50 MeV is 5e7 eV.

So,

lambda = 12400 /5e7 = 12400 /50,000,000 = 0.000248 fm.

Hmm, so that's 2.48e-4 fm. Then, k is 2pi/lambda.

So,

k = 2pi / (2.48e-4 fm) ≈ 6.2832 / 0.000248 fm = about 25337 fm⁻¹.

Wait, that seems correct.

So, now I have k ≈ 25337 fm⁻¹.

Wait, but wait a second. Since the imaginary part of f is (1/(2k)) multiplied by the sum of (2l +1)*δ_l sin(δ_l), each term is for l=0,1,2,3,4.

So, the sum is for l from 0 to 4.

So, let's compute each term:

l=0: (2*0+1) =1. δ_0=90°, sin(90)=1. So term is 1 * 1 =1.

l=1: 2+1=3. δ_1=67°, sin(67)= ~0.9205. So 3 * 0.9205≈2.7615.

l=2: 2*2+1=5. δ=55°, sin(55)= ~0.8192. 5 *0.8192≈4.096.

l=3: 7 * sin(30). sin(30)=0.5. 7 *0.5= 3.5.

l=4: 9 * sin(13). sin(13)≈0.22495. 9 * 0.22495≈2.02455.

So, summing all:

1 + 2.7615=3.7615

+4.096 → 7.8575

+3.5 →11.3575

+2.02455 →13.38205.

So the sum is approx 13.3821.

Now, multiply by (1/(2k)).

k ≈25337 fm⁻¹.

So, 1/(2*25337) = 1/(50674) ≈ 1.973e-5 fm⁻¹.

Then, multiply by the sum:

13.3821 * 1.973e-5 ≈ ?

Let me compute that:

13.3821 * 1.973e-5.

First, 13.3821 * 1.973 = approx 13 * 2 =26, but precise:

13.3821 * 1.973 ≈ let's compute it:

13.3821 * 1.973 ≈ (13 *1.973) + (0.3821 * 1.973)

13 *1.973=25.649.

0.3821 *1.973 ≈ 0.753.

So total approx 25.649 +0.753=26.402.

So, 26.402e-5 = 2.6402e-4.

Wait, but wait, 13.3821 *1.973e-5 is 13.3821 * 1.973 * 1e-5.

Which is (approx 26.402) *1e-5 = 2.6402e-4.

But wait, the units:

The sum is dimensionless, and 1/(2k) is in fm.

So, the overall units are fm.

So, the imaginary part is approximately 2.64e-4 fm.

Wait, that's way smaller than the options given. The options are in the hundreds of fm. So this can't be right. Hmm, I must have messed up the calculation somewhere.

Wait, let's double-check the calculation.

Wait, k is 25337 fm⁻¹.

So, 1/(2k) = 1/(2*25337) = 1/50674 ≈ 1.973e-5 fm⁻¹.

Wait, no, wait: because k is in fm⁻¹, so 1/k is in fm. So 1/(2k) is in fm.

So, 1/(2k) = 1/(2 *25337 fm⁻¹ ) = (1 / 50674) fm⁻¹⁻¹ = (1.973e-5) fm.

So, the imaginary part is sum * (1.973e-5) fm.

So, sum is 13.3821.

13.3821 * 1.973e-5 = ?

Let me compute 13.3821 * 1.973e-5.

13.3821 * 1.973e-5 ≈ (13.3821 * 1.973) * 1e-5.

13.3821 * 1.973 = approximately:

13 *1.973 = 25.649.

0.3821 *1.973 ≈ 0.753.

So total ≈25.649 + 0.753 = 26.402.

Multiply by 1e-5 → 26.402e-5 → 0.00026402 fm.

Wait, 0.000264 fm is 2.64e-4 fm, which is 0.264 Angstroms, but the options are in the 100s of fm. So this can't be right. I must have made a mistake in calculating k.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the units. Let me re-examine the calculation of k.

Wait, another approach: use the formula for the scattering amplitude.

The formula is:

Im f(θ=0) = (1/(2k)) * sum_{l=0}^L (2l+1) delta_l sin(delta_l)

But perhaps I missed a factor. Maybe the formula is actually:

Im f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) * sum [ ... ]

Wait, no, I think I was correct earlier. But another possibility: perhaps the formula for f includes a factor of (2l +1) and the sum is [ (2l+1) ( δ_l exp(i δ_l) -1 ) P_l(cosθ) ].

Wait, but for θ=0, as we said, P_l(1) is 1, so the sum becomes sum (2l+1) ( δ_l exp(i δ_l) -1 )

Then, the imaginary part is sum (2l+1) Im( δ_l e^{i δ} )

Which is sum (2l+1) δ_l sin(δ_l )

So yes, that part was correct.

So where's the mistake? Oh wait, perhaps the energy used for k is the kinetic energy, not the total energy. So E = 50 MeV + 0.511 MeV ≈ 50.511 MeV.

But the difference is small compared to 50 MeV, so maybe it's negligible. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have used E=50 MeV as the total energy, so including rest mass. But in that case, E² = (pc)^2 + (m_e c²)^2.

Wait, if E=50 MeV, then (pc)^2 = (50)^2 - (0.511)^2 ≈ 2500 - 0.261 = ~2499.739, so p c ≈ sqrt(2499.739) ≈ 49.997 MeV.

So, p c ≈50 MeV.

So, p = 50 MeV / c.

Thus, k = p / ( ħ c ) = (50 MeV / c ) / (197.33 MeV fm )

Wait, the units: [MeV cancel, c in denominator is in m/s, but the numerator is 50 MeV/c. So,

k = (50 MeV/(c)) / (197.33 MeV fm )

= (50)/(197.33) * (1/(c)) / fm )

But (1/c) is in s/m.

So the units become (m/s)^-1 * 1/(fm) ) → (s/m) * 1/fm → s/(m fm) → since 1 fm is 1e-15 m,

= s / ( m * 1e-15 m ) ) = s / (1e-15 m²) → which doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps I should convert all units into SI.

Wait, let me compute k in SI units.

E = 50 MeV = 50e6 eV * 1.602e-19 J/eV = 50e6 * 1.602e-19 J = 8.01e-13 J.

m_e c^2 = 0.511 MeV = 0.511e6 eV * 1.602e-19 J/eV = 8.18e-14 J.

So,

E² = (8.01e-13 J)^2 = 6.416e-25 J².

(m_e c^2 )² = (8.18e-14 J)^2 = 6.69e-27 J².

So,

(pc)^2 = E² - (m_e c^2 )² = 6.416e-25 -6.69e-27 ≈ 6.349e-25 J².

So,

p c = sqrt(6.349e-25) = ~7.968e-13 J s/m.

Because p c has units of J s/m.

Wait, J = kg m²/s², so (J s/m ) is kg m/(s).

So,

p = (7.968e-13 J s/m ) / c 

c = 3e8 m/s.

So,

p = 7.968e-13 / (3e8) ) kg/m.

= 2.656e-21 kg/m.

k = p / ( ħ )

ħ = 1.0545718e-34 J s.

So,

k = (2.656e-21 kg/m ) / (1.0545718e-34 J s ) 

But J = kg m²/s², so J s = kg m²/s.

Thus,

kg/m divided by kg m²/s → (kg/m) * (s)/(kg m²) ) → s/(m^3).

Wait, not sure about the units, but let's compute numerically.

k ≈ 2.656e-21 / 1.05457e-34 → approximately 2.52e13 m⁻¹.

Convert to fm⁻¹: 1 m = 1e15 fm, so 2.52e13 m⁻¹ = 2.52e13 / 1e15 fm⁻¹ = 2.52e-2 fm⁻¹.

Wait, that can't be right. 2.52e-2 fm⁻¹ is 0.0252 fm⁻¹.

Wait, but earlier when I used the high-energy approximation, I got k ≈25337 fm⁻¹.

Now, using precise calculation, I get k≈0.0252 fm⁻¹.

Which is very different. Now I'm confused. Which approach is correct?

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that when E is much larger than m_e c², the approximation E≈pc is valid, so p c ≈ E.

Thus, p ≈ E/(c)

Hence, k = p/(ħ c ) = (E/(c)) / (ħ c ) ) = E/( ħ c² )

E is 50 MeV, which is 50e6 eV.

But ħ c² is in (MeV fm ) * (c^2 ), but I'm getting stuck on units. Let me compute E/( ħ c² )

E =50 MeV.

ħ c = 197.33 MeV fm.

So, ħ c² = (197.33 MeV fm) * c.

Wait, but c has units of fm/s? Or perhaps I should just compute the numerical value.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula k = (E)/(ħ c² ) and see.

E is 50 MeV.

ħ c² = 197.33 MeV fm * (3e8 m/s )

But wait, that would give units of MeV fm m/s, which doesn't help.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider E in Joules, and ħ c² in J·m.

Wait, E =50e6 eV * 1.602e-19 J/eV = 8.01e-13 J.

ħ c^2 = (1.05457e-34 J·s) * (3e8 m/s )^2 

= 1.05457e-34 *9e16 m²/s² * J·s

= 9.491e-18 J·m.

So,

k = E/( ħ c^2 ) = 8.01e-13 J / 9.491e-18 J·m = (8.01e-13 )/(9.491e-18 ) m⁻¹ ≈ 8.44e4 m⁻¹.

Convert to fm⁻¹: 1 m=1e15 fm.

So,

k ≈8.44e4 m⁻¹ = 8.44e4 / 1e15 fm⁻¹ = 8.44e-11 fm⁻¹.

Wait, that's about 8.44e-11 fm⁻¹, which is way smaller than the previous high-energy approximation. Hmm, something's wrong here.

Wait, maybe the correct approach is to compute k from the high-energy approximation.

In high-energy limit, E≈pc, so p=E/(c).

k = p/(ħ c ) = E/( ħ c² )

E in J, ħ in J s, c in m/s.

E =50 MeV =50e6 * 1.602e-19 J =8.01e-13 J.

ħ =1.05457e-34 J s.

c=3e8 m/s.

So,

k = (8.01e-13 J) / ( (1.05457e-34 J s) * (3e8 m/s )^2 )

Wait,

Denominator: (1.05457e-34 J s) * (9e16 m²/s² )

= 1.05457e-34 *9e16 * J s m²/s² 

= 9.491e-18 J m²/s.

But numerator is 8.01e-13 J.

So,

k = 8.01e-13 / 9.491e-18 * (J ) / ( J m²/s )

= (8.01e-13 /9.491e-18 ) * s / m² 

= (8.44e4 ) * s/m².

Wait, but this leaves k with units of s/m², which doesn't make sense. I must have made a mistake in the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to use the formula:

k = (E) / ( ħ c )

But with E in units compatible with ħ c.

Wait, ħ c is 197.33 MeV fm.

So, E =50 MeV.

Thus, k = 50 MeV / (197.33 MeV fm )

= 50 /197.33 fm⁻¹ ≈ 0.253 fm⁻¹.

Ah, this makes sense.

So, k ≈0.253 fm⁻¹.

Wait, that's a much more manageable number. So perhaps I made a mistake earlier in the unit conversions.

So, k ≈50 / 197.33 fm⁻¹ ≈0.253 fm⁻¹.

That seems more reasonable. So now, 1/(2k) is (1/(2 *0.253 )) fm = (1/0.506 ) fm ≈1.976 fm.

So,

Im(f) = 1.976 fm * sum( (2l+1) δ_l sin(δ_l) )

Wait, sum was 13.3821.

So,

Im(f) = 1.976 *13.3821 ≈ ?

Calculating 1.976 *13.3821:

Approx 2 *13.3821 =26.764, but subtract 0.024 *13.3821 ≈0.321.

So, 26.764 -0.321 ≈26.443.

So, Im(f)≈26.443 fm.

Wait, but looking at the options, the closest option is B) 355.351 fm, C)177.675 fm, D)251.271 fm.

Hmm, 26.443 is not among them. So perhaps I made a mistake in the sum.

Wait, earlier I calculated the sum as 13.3821. Let me recheck each term.

l=0: 2*0+1=1. δ=90 → sin=1 → term=1.

l=1: 3 * sin(67)=3 *0.9205=2.7615.

l=2:5 * sin(55)=5 * 0.8192=4.096.

l=3:7 * sin(30)=7 *0.5=3.5.

l=4:9 * sin(13)=9 *0.22495≈2.02455.

Adding them: 1 +2.7615=3.7615; +4.096=7.8575; +3.5=11.3575; +2.02455=13.38205.

Yes, sum is 13.38205.

So, Im(f)=1.976 *13.38205 ≈26.44 fm.

But options are much larger. So where is the mistake?

Wait, perhaps I forgot that each phase shift is in degrees, and I should convert them to radians before computing sine.

Yes! Oh, right! Because the formula assumes that δ_l is in radians, but the given values are in degrees. So I should convert each δ_l from degrees to radians before computing sin(δ_l).

Ah, that must be the mistake.

So, let's recompute each term with δ_l in radians.

Compute each δ_l in radians:

δ_0=90° → π/2 ≈1.5708 rad.

sin(1.5708)=1.

l=0:1 *1=1.

δ_1=67° → 67 * π/180 ≈1.16937 rad.

sin(1.16937)=approx 0.9205.

l=1:3 *0.9205=2.7615.

δ_2=55° →55 * π/180 ≈0.95993 rad.

sin(0.95993)= approx 0.8192.

l=2:5 *0.8192=4.096.

δ_3=30° →30 * π/180= π/6 ≈0.5236 rad.

sin(0.5236)=0.5.

l=3:7 *0.5=3.5.

δ_4=13° →13 * π/180 ≈0.2269 rad.

sin(0.2269)=approx 0.2249.

l=4:9 *0.2249≈2.0241.

So, sum is same as before:1 +2.7615=3.7615 +4.096=7.8575 +3.5=11.3575 +2.0241=13.3816.

So the sum is same, because the sine values are same as before.

Wait, but that's the same sum. So that can't be the mistake. Then why are the units so small?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating k.

Wait, alternative approach: perhaps the correct formula for k is k = (E)/(ħ c²) * (1/(1 - (m_e c^2)/(2 E)) ), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps k is indeed about 0.253 fm⁻¹.

So, then Im(f)=1.976 *13.3816 ≈26.44 fm.

But none of the options match. So perhaps I'm missing a factor.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the formula is Im(f) = (1/(2k)) * sum ( (2l+1) [ (δ_l sin δ_l ) ] )

But perhaps there's a factor of 1/(1 + ...) ?

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is Im(f) = sum ( (2l+1) δ_l sin δ_l ) / (2k )

Which is what I did. So that part is correct.

So, perhaps the error is in the calculation of k.

Let me try to compute k properly.

k = p / ( ħ c )

p = (E² - m_e^2 c^4 )^(1/2) / (c )

E=50 MeV, m_e c²=0.511 MeV.

So,

p c = sqrt(50² - 0.511² ) ≈ sqrt(2500 -0.261 )=sqrt(2499.739 )≈49.9973 MeV.

So,

p =49.9973 MeV / c.

Now, ħ c ≈197.33 MeV fm.

So,

k = p / ( ħ c ) = (49.9973 MeV / c ) / (197.33 MeV fm )

= (49.9973 ) / (197.33 * c ) fm⁻¹.

Wait, but c is in m/s. So units are MeV/(c * MeV fm )

Wait, no, perhaps better to compute numerically.

k = (49.9973 MeV/c ) / (197.33 MeV fm )

= (49.9973) / (197.33 * c ) [MeV/c / (MeV fm) ]

Hmm, but the c in the denominator and numerator would cancel.

Wait, 49.9973 MeV/c divided by 197.33 MeV fm is (49.9973 / 197.33 ) * (1/(fm) )

Because the MeV cancels, and c in denominator from p cancels with c in denominator from ħ c.

So,

k = (49.9973 / 197.33 ) fm⁻¹ ≈0.253 fm⁻¹.

Which brings us back to the same k as before.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in the initial formula for the scattering amplitude. Maybe the formula is different.

Wait, the general formula for the scattering amplitude f(θ) is:

f(θ) = sum_{l=0}^L [ (2l+1) (δ_l e^{i δ_l} -1 ) P_l (cosθ) ) ] / (2ik)

So, the imaginary part is Im[ f ] = sum [ (2l+1) * Im( δ_l e^{i δ_l} ) * P_l (cosθ) ) ] / (2k )

Because Im(1) is zero.

Im(δ_l e^{i δ_l} )= δ_l sin δ_l.

At θ=0, P_l(1)=1, so:

Im(f)= sum [ (2l+1) * δ_l sin δ_l ] / (2k )

Which is what I calculated.

So, the formula is correct.

If k is indeed 0.253 fm⁻¹, and sum is 13.382,

Im(f)=13.382/(2 *0.253) ) fm.

Wait, 13.382/(0.506) ≈26.44 fm.

But the options are much larger. So perhaps I made a mistake in calculating k.

Wait, another approach: using the relation between scattering amplitude and cross-section.

Wait, perhaps the formula for the differential cross-section is:

dσ/dΩ = |f(θ)|² = sum [ ... ]

But I'm not sure if that's helpful here.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the fact that the scattering amplitude's imaginary part is in units of fm, and the options are in hundreds of fm, so my calculation is way off.

So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k.

Wait, alternative approach: compute k as (E)/(ħ c ) * (1 - (m_e c²)/(2 E) )

Wait, the relativistic correction for high energies.

Wait, no, perhaps I should use the non-relativistic formula for k.

In non-relativistic, E ≈ p²/(2m_e ), so p = sqrt(2 m_e E )

Then, k = p / (ħ )

But E here is kinetic energy.

But if E=50 MeV, much larger than m_e c², so non-relativistic approach isn't valid.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the relation k = (m_e c^2 )/(ħ c ) * (v/c )

But v ≈c.

So, k = (m_e c^2)/( ħ c² ) * c = m_e c/( ħ )

Which is 0.511 MeV / (197.33 MeV fm ) → 0.511/197.33 fm⁻¹ ≈ 0.002587 fm⁻¹.

Which is about 0.0026 fm⁻¹.

So,

Im(f) = sum/(2k )

sum=13.382,

2k=0.005174 fm⁻¹.

Im(f)=13.382 /0.005174 fm ≈2587 fm.

Hmm, that's close to option D) 251.27 fm, but still off.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have used the relativistic energy expression correctly.

Wait, perhaps in the formula for f, k is given by sqrt( (m_e c^2 )^2 + p^2 c^2 ) / (ħ c^2 )

Wait, no, perhaps not.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula for k is:

k = (E )/( ħ c^2 ) * (1 - (m_e c^2 )/(2 E) )

But I'm not certain.

Wait, another approach: Let's look for an example calculation.

In the example of the Coulomb scattering, but that's not relevant here. Alternatively, perhaps I should just proceed to compute k as 50 MeV / (197.33 MeV fm) ) =0.253 fm⁻¹.

Then, Im(f)= sum/(2k )=13.382/(2 *0.253) )= 13.382/0.506≈26.44 fm.

But the options are in the 177-251 range. So perhaps I made a mistake in the phase shift sum.

Wait, let me recheck the phase shift signs. Oh wait, some of the phase shifts are negative? No, the problem states the phase shifts: δ_0=90, δ_1=67, δ_2=55, etc. So all are positive.

So, all terms in the sum are positive, so sum is correct.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula requires the sum to be multiplied by (2l+1) times a factor of (1/ (something else)).

Wait, perhaps I forgot that the formula for f(θ) is (1/(2ik)) sum ... instead of (1/(2k)) as I used.

Wait, because f has real and imaginary parts, so:

f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) sum [ (2l+1) (δ_l e^{iδ} -1 ) P_l(cosθ) ]

So, the imaginary part is:

Im(f) = (1/(2k)) sum [ (2l+1) Im( δ_l e^{iδ} ) P_l ]

Which is what I used.

But wait, perhaps the correct factor is (1/(2ik)), so the imaginary part is [ (sum ... ) ]/(2k).

Which is what I did.

But then, why is the result not matching the options?

Wait, perhaps I have a mistake in the formula. Maybe the formula is f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) sum [ ... ]

So, when taking the imaginary part, it's (1/(2k)) sum [ Im( ... ) ]

Wait, yes, because 1/(2ik) is (1/(2i k)).

So, when multiplied by a term with Im part, the overall factor is (1/(2k)).

Which is what I did.

So, perhaps the issue is elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the phase shifts are in degrees, but when calculating sin(delta_l), I should use radians.

Wait, I did that. Because when I computed sin(67), I converted 67 degrees to radians, which was about 1.16937 radians, and the sine was 0.9205.

Wait, but that's the same as using degrees, because the sine of 67 degrees is the same as the sine of ~1.169 radians.

Wait, that's correct.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem asks for the scattering amplitude in the direction of the incident beam, which is θ=0 degrees.

But wait, perhaps the formula is different at θ=0.

Wait, the Legendre polynomials at cosθ=1 for each l:

P_0 (1) =1,

P_1(1)=1,

P_2(1)=1,

P_3(1)=1,

P_4(1)=1,

Yes, as I thought earlier.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the scattering amplitude is given per unit of something else, or perhaps I'm missing a factor of 2.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the formula is (1/(4π k)) instead of (1/(2k)).

Because sometimes scattering amplitude formulas have 1/(4π k) as a factor.

Wait, if that's the case, then Im(f) = sum/(4π k )

But that would make the result smaller, not larger.

Wait, in some conventions, the scattering amplitude is written as (1/(2ik)) sum ... , but in others, it's (1/(4π k)) sum ... .

If the formula is (1/(4π k)) sum ... , then Im(f) is sum/(4π k )

Which would be 13.382/(4*3.1416*0.253 )

Compute denominator: 4 *3.1416=12.5664.

12.5664 *0.253 ≈3.173.

So,

Im(f)=13.382 /3.173 ≈4.21 fm.

Which is even smaller.

Not matching the options.

Hmm.

Another possibility: perhaps the phase shifts are given in radians, and I used degrees. But in that case, converting them to radians would change the values. Wait, no, the question says the phase shifts are measured, and given in degrees. So we should convert to radians before computing sine.

Which I did.

Hmm.

Wait, maybe the calculation of the sum is wrong because the phase shifts are given as delta_o, delta_1,... delta_4, which are for l=0,1,2,3,4.

Yes, that's correct.

Hmm.

I'm stuck. All my calculations give Im(f)≈26.44 fm, but none of the options match.

Wait, perhaps the formula requires the sum to include (2l+1)*delta_l * sin(delta_l), then multiply by 1/(2k).

But with k= (50 MeV ) / (197.33 MeV fm )=0.253 fm⁻¹.

Wait, 1/(2k)=1.976 fm.

So,

Im(f)=1.976 *13.382≈26.44 fm.

Not matching any option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial step.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the formula for the imaginary part is (sum (2l+1) ) / (2k )

Wait, no, because each term has δ_l sin δ_l.

Wait, sum is 1 +3*0.9205 +5*0.8192 +7*0.5 +9*0.2249.

Which is 1 +2.7615 +4.096 +3.5 +2.024 →13.3815.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is sum ( (2l+1) * (1 - cos δ_l) )

But that would give a different sum.

No, because the formula is based on the imaginary part.

Wait, perhaps the phase shifts are given in radians already, and the calculation is correct as done.

But given that, the answer doesn't match the options. So perhaps the mistake is in the calculation of k.

Wait, perhaps the correct value of k is 1/(0.002426 fm) ≈412 fm⁻¹.

But that would make Im(f)=13.382/(2*412)≈0.0164 fm, which is even smaller.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the formula is Im(f) = sum ( (2l+1) δ_l sin δ_l ) * (ħ c^2 )/(2 E )

Because E is in the denominator.

Hmm, this is getting too speculative.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look for the correct formula for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude.

After some research (pretending), I recall that the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude is given by:

Im(f) = (1/(2k)) * sum_{l=0}^L (2l+1) δ_l sin δ_l.

Which is what I used.

If the calculation leads to 26.44 fm, but the options are about 177, 251, 355, perhaps I missed a factor of 10^3.

Wait, perhaps the formula uses k in units of 1/(fm), but I used k in 1/fm.

No, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the sum is 13.382, but the correct value is 1338.2 due to a missing factor of 100.

But why?

Alternatively, perhaps the phase shifts are in radians, so delta_l in the sum is in radians.

Wait, no, because when I converted degrees to radians, the sum didn't change.

Wait, perhaps I should not have converted to radians, but kept the phase shifts in degrees.

Because, wait, perhaps the formula uses delta_l in degrees, so sin(delta_l degrees).

Wait, but that would give wrong results.

For example, delta_0=90 degrees, so sin(90 degrees)=1.

So that term is correct.

But for delta_1=67 degrees, sin(67)=0.9205.

Which is the same as when converting to radians.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that the phase shifts are given in radians, and the answer expects them to be treated as such, but I thought they were in degrees.

Wait, the question says the phase shifts are measured as 90°, 67°, etc. So they are in degrees.

So, I did the correct calculation.

Hmm.

I'm stuck. According to my calculations, the answer should be around 26.44 fm, but that's not one of the options.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the sum to be multiplied by (1/ (2 k )) but k is in the denominator.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the formula for the imaginary part is (sum) * (ħ c^2 )/( 2 E )

So,

Im(f) = sum (2l+1) δ_l sin δ_l * (ħ c^2 )/( 2 E )

Where E is 50 MeV.

Compute this:

sum=13.382,

ħ c^2 = 197.33 MeV fm * c.

E=50 MeV.

So,

Im(f) =13.382 * (197.33 MeV fm * c ) / (2 *50 MeV )

=13.382 * (197.33 * c ) / (100 )

=13.382 * (197.33 *3e8 m/s ) / 100.

Wait, but this is getting too big.

Wait, perhaps the units are not correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is Im(f) = sum * (ħ c^2 )/(2 E k )

But not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the correct answer is C) 177.675 fm.

Which is about 6.73 times larger than 26.44.

Hmm.

Wait, 26.44 *6.73= approx 178.

So, perhaps I missed a factor of about 6.73.

Wait, where could that factor come from.

Wait, perhaps the formula is Im(f) = sum ( (2l+1) delta_l sin delta_l ) * (1/(2k)) )

But if k is in the wrong units, perhaps I forgot to convert from meters to femtometers.

Wait, perhaps I should compute k in meters instead of fm.

Wait, earlier when I computed k=0.253 fm⁻¹, which is 0.253 / 1e-15 m⁻¹ = 2.53e14 m⁻¹.

Wait, that can't be right. Because 1 fm⁻¹ is 1e15 m⁻¹.

Wait, no, 1 fm⁻¹ equals 1e15 m⁻¹, because 1 fm is 1e-15 m.

So, 1 fm⁻¹ =1e15 m⁻¹.

So, k=0.253 fm⁻¹=0.253e15 m⁻¹=2.53e14 m⁻¹.

Then,

1/(2k)=1/(5.06e14 m⁻¹ )= 1.976e-15 m.

Which is 1.976e-15 m =1.976e-15 *1e15 fm =1.976 fm.

Ah, so the initial calculation was correct, Im(f)=1.976 *13.382≈26.44 fm.

But the options don't have that.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for the imaginary part is sum(2l+1) delta_l sin delta_l / (2k )

But with k in units of 1/(fm), so 0.253 fm⁻¹.

So,

Im(f)=13.382 / (2 *0.253 )=13.382/0.506≈26.44 fm.

Hmm, but no option is close.

Wait, perhaps the phase shifts are given for partial waves up to l=4, but the formula requires summing over all l, including higher terms, but the problem says to ignore the rest beyond delta_4.

No, the sum is correct.

Hmm.

At this point, I think I must have made a mistake in the calculation of k, but I can't see where. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options, but that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps I should recompute k.

Given E=50 MeV,

k = E/( ħ c )

E =50 MeV,

ħ c=197.33 MeV fm.

So,

k=50 / 197.33 fm⁻¹≈0.253 fm⁻¹.

Thus, 1/(2k)=1.976 fm.

Sum is 13.382.

So,

Im(f)=1.976 *13.382≈26.44 fm.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is different. Maybe the formula includes a factor of 1/(1 + ...) due to relativistic effects.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the reduced mass.

Wait, but the target is a nucleus, so the reduced mass μ is (m_e m_N)/(m_e + m_N )≈ m_e, since m_N is much larger than m_e.

But that would make the calculation the same.

Hmm.

Another possibility: perhaps the formula uses the impact parameter instead of the scattering amplitude.

But I don't think so.

Wait, perhaps the formula should include the nuclear charge number or something else, but the problem doesn't provide that.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is D)251.271 fm.

Which is approximately 251.27 fm.

Which is 251.27/26.44≈9.5 times larger than my result.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is Im(f) = sum( (2l+1) ) * [ (ħ c^2 )/( 2 E ) ].

But that would be:

sum=1+3+5+7+9=25.

Im(f)=25*(197.33 MeV fm )/(2 *50 MeV )

=25*(197.33)/(100 )

=25*1.9733≈49.33 fm.

Still not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is Im(f) = sum ( (2l+1) delta_l ) * (ħ c^2 )/( 2 E )

But sum (2l+1) delta_l is:

1*90 +3*67 +5*55 +7*30 +9*13.

Which is 90 +201 +275 +210 +117 = 90+201=291; 291+275=566; 566+210=776; 776+117=893.

So sum=893.

Im(f)= 893 * (197.33 MeV fm )/( 2 *50 MeV )

=893 *197.33/(100 )

=893 *1.9733≈1764 fm.

Which is way larger than the options.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is Im(f) = sum ( (2l+1) delta_l ) * (ħ c^2 )/( 2 E )

Which would be 893 * 197.33 / (2 *50 ) → same as above.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is Im(f) = sum ( (2l+1) [ (delta_l ) * (1 - cos delta_l ) ] ) * (ħ c^2 )/( 2 E )

But that would be more complicated.

Wait, let's compute sum (2l+1) * delta_l * (1 - cos delta_l )

delta_l in degrees.

For l=0: 1*90*(1-0)=90.

l=1:3*67*(1- cos67)=3*67*(1-0.3907)=3*67*0.6093≈3*40.96≈122.88.

l=2:5*55*(1- cos55)=5*55*(1-0.5736)=5*55*0.4264≈5*23.452≈117.26.

l=3:7*30*(1- cos30)=7*30*(1-0.8660)=7*30*0.134≈7*4.02≈28.14.

l=4:9*13*(1- cos13)=9*13*(1-0.9744)=9*13*0.0256≈9*0.3328≈2.995.

Sum ≈90 +122.88=212.88 +117.26=330.14 +28.14=358.28 +2.995≈361.275.

Then, Im(f)=361.275 * (197.33 MeV fm )/(2 *50 MeV )

=361.275 *197.33 /100 → 361.275 *1.9733≈712.3 fm.

Still not matching options.

Hmm.

I'm stuck. I think I'll have to go with my initial calculation, which gives approximately 26.44 fm, but it's not an option. Perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k.

Wait, perhaps I should compute k in terms of the de Broglie wavelength.

The de Broglie wavelength λ = h / p.

p=50 MeV /c.

h=6.626e-34 J s.

So,

λ =6.626e-34 J s / (50e6 *1.602e-13 J s/m )

Wait, p =50e6 eV /c =50e6 *1.602e-13 J/(c )

Wait, J = kg m²/s², so J s/m = kg m/s.

So,

p=50e6 *1.602e-13 kg m/s.

=8.01e-7 kg m/s.

So,

λ =6.626e-34 J s / (8.01e-7 kg m/s )

=6.626e-34 /8.01e-7 m.

=8.27e-28 m =8.27e-13 fm.

So, wavelength is 8.27e-13 fm.

Which is 0.827 fm.

Hmm, but 1/lambda is k.

So,

k=1/lambda =1/(8.27e-13 fm )=1.208e12 fm⁻¹.

Which is way too large. So, this approach can't be right.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that I forgot that in the formula for f, the denominator is 2ik, not 2k.

But since I'm taking the imaginary part, it's (1/(2k)) multiplied by the sum, which is correct.

Hmm.

At this point, I think I'll have to proceed with the initial answer, but since it's not matching the options, perhaps the correct approach is to choose the closest option, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the sum.

Wait, perhaps the phase shifts are given in radians, so delta_0=90 radians, which is way too large. That can't be.

No, the problem states the phase shifts are measured in degrees.

Thus, I think the correct answer according to my calculation is approximately 26.44 fm, but it's not an option. Therefore, I must have made a mistake somewhere. Perhaps the correct approach is to choose option D) 251.271 fm, which is close to 26.44 *9.5.

Alternatively, perhaps I forgot to multiply by 10 somewhere. But I can't see where.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the phase shifts are delta_0, delta_1, etc., up to delta_4, but perhaps the formula requires l to go up to (n-1), where n is the number of data points. But that wouldn't change the sum.

Hmm.

I think I'm stuck. Based on the calculations, the answer should be approximately 26.44 fm, but since that's not an option, perhaps the correct choice based on the given options and the possible miscalculation is option D) 251.271 fm.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction using the given phase shifts and the formula:

\[
\text{Im}(f) = \frac{1}{2k} \sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1) \delta_l \sin(\delta_l)
\]

### Key Steps:
1. **Phase Shifts and Conversion**:  
   The phase shifts are given as:
   \[
   \delta_0 = 90^\circ, \, \delta_1 = 67^\circ, \, \delta_2 = 55^\circ, \, \delta_3 = 30^\circ, \, \delta_4 = 13^\circ
   \]
   Convert these to radians for consistency in calculations:
   \[
   \delta_0 \approx 1.5708, \, \delta_1 \approx 1.1694, \, \delta_2 \approx 0.9599, \, \delta_3 \approx 0.5236, \, \delta_4 \approx 0.2269
   \]

2. **Compute the Sum**:  
   For each \( l \), calculate \( (2l+1) \delta_l \sin(\delta_l) \):
   - \( l = 0 \): \( (2(0)+1) \cdot 90^\circ \cdot \sin(90^\circ) = 1 \cdot 1 = 1 \)
   - \( l = 1 \): \( (2(1)+1) \cdot 67^\circ \cdot \sin(67^\circ) = 3 \cdot 0.9205 \approx 2.7615 \)
   - \( l = 2 \): \( (2(2)+1) \cdot 55^\circ \cdot \sin(55^\circ) = 5 \cdot 0.8192 \approx 4.096 \)
   - \( l = 3 \): \( (2(3)+1) \cdot 30^\circ \cdot \sin(30^\circ) = 7 \cdot 0.5 = 3.5 \)
   - \( l = 4 \): \( (2(4)+1) \cdot 13^\circ \cdot \sin(13^\circ) = 9 \cdot 0.22495 \approx 2.0246 \)

   Summing these terms:
   \[
   \text{Sum} = 1 + 2.7615 + 4.096 + 3.5 + 2.0246 \approx 13.3821
   \]

3. **Calculate \( k \)**:  
   The wave number \( k \) is derived from the electron's energy \( E = 50 \, \text{MeV} \) using:
   \[
   k = \frac{E}{\hbar c}
   \]
   Substituting \( \hbar c \approx 197.33 \, \text{MeV·fm} \):
   \[
   k = \frac{50}{197.33} \, \text{fm}^{-1} \approx 0.253 \, \text{fm}^{-1}
   \]

4. **Compute \( \text{Im}(f) \)**:  
   Using the formula:
   \[
   \text{Im}(f) = \frac{\text{Sum}}{2k} = \frac{13.3821}{2 \cdot 0.253} \approx \frac{13.3821}{0.506} \approx 26.44 \, \text{fm}
   \]

### Analysis of Options:
The calculated result \( \text{Im}(f) \approx 26.44 \, \text{fm} \) does not match any of the provided options. The closest option is **D) 251.271 fm**, which is approximately 9.5 times larger than the computed value. This discrepancy suggests either a missing factor in the calculation or an error in interpreting the problem's parameters.

### Conclusion:
Based on the given options and the calculations, the most reasonable choice is:

**Answer: D**
