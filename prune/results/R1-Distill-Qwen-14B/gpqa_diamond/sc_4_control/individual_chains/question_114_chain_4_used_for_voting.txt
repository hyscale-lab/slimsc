Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about selecting the right reagents for two reactions. Let me see what the reactions are.

The first reaction is between butan-2-one and NaCN with reagent A, producing 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? So when it reacts with NaCN, which is a source of CN- ions, I think it's a nucleophilic addition. But wait, ketones typically undergo nucleophilic addition, but under what conditions?

Oh right, if you have a ketone reacting with a cyanide, that's usually via a two-step process. First, the ketone would react with something like HCN to form a cyanohydrin. But wait, NaCN is a source of CN- which is a nucleophile. So maybe the reaction is NaCN in an acidic condition. Because I remember that the formation of cyanohydrin from ketones requires acid catalysis. So, the first step is adding H+ (acid) to the carbonyl oxygen, making it more electrophilic. Then the CN- attacks, forming the addition product.

So for the first reaction, reagent A is probably H3O+ or H2SO4, something acidic. Looking at the options, options A and B have A as H3O+, while C and D have A as NaHSO3. Hmm, but wait, why would NaHSO3 be used? NaHSO3 is a source of HSO3-, which is a weaker acid than H3O+ but also a good nucleophile perhaps. Or maybe it's a different kind of reaction.

Wait, but the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So the product is a cyanohydrin. So yes, the reaction is acid-catalyzed. So A must be H3O+ as in options A and B.

Now the second reaction is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacting with reagent B (H2O) to give the corresponding butanoic acid. So, the nitrile group (-CN) is being converted into a carboxylic acid (-COOH). How does that happen?

Oh, right, the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids. The typical conditions for this are either acidic or basic. But wait, let me think. For nitrile hydrolysis, under acidic conditions, you generally use H3O+ and heat. Or sometimes, in the presence of a catalyst like H2SO4. Alternatively, in basic conditions, you might use something like aqueous NaOH with heat, followed by acid work-up.

Wait, but in the presence of H2O and reagent B. So the reagent B is something that would facilitate the hydrolysis of the nitrile to a carboxylic acid. Let me think about the options. The options for B are HCl, CH3COOH, etc.

Looking at the options, for the second part, the reagent B is given as H2O, so perhaps the hydrolysis is done under acidic or another condition. Wait, no, the question says the reagent B is (H2O). Wait, no, the reaction is written as 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H2O) → ... So B is the reagent, and H2O is the solvent or perhaps a component.

Wait, perhaps B is the catalyst or acid. So, nitrile hydrolysis to carboxylic acid can be done under strong acidic conditions, like HCl, or under basic conditions, like with H2O and H+.

Wait, another thought: the reaction is nitrile to carboxylic acid. So, the nitrile is first hydrolyzed to an amide, then to a carboxylic acid. Or perhaps via the hydrocyanic acid intermediate.

Wait, alternatively, the hydrolysis of nitriles under acidic conditions typically uses a strong acid like HCl in aqueous conditions. So for the second reaction, the reagent B is probably HCl.

Looking at the options, the options for B are HCl (A and C) or CH3COOH (B and D).

So for the second reaction, if B is HCl, that would make sense for the conversion of nitrile to acid. So in the options, option A has B as HCl, and option C has B as HCl as well. Wait, looking back:

Options:

A) A = H3O+, B = HCl

B) A = H3O+, B = CH3COOH

C) A = NaHSO3, B = HCl

D) A = NaHSO3, B = CH3COOH

So, considering the first reaction: the product is a cyanohydrin, which requires acid. So A should be H3O+ (so options A or B). But wait, what about the second reaction? It needs HCl as the reagent.

So if option A says A is H3O+ and B is HCl, that would fit both reactions.

Wait, but let me think again. The first reaction is butan-2-one + NaCN + A → product. So butan-2-one plus NaCN—this would be a nucleophilic addition. The mechanism is: the ketone is protonated (acid catalyzed), then CN- attacks, then water attacks the adjacent carbon, leading to the formation of the alcohol and nitrile group.

So reagent A is the acid. So in the options, A must be H3O+.

So for the first reaction, A is H3O+.

Now the second reaction: in the presence of H2O and reagent B, the nitrile becomes a carboxylic acid. So the conditions would be acidic hydrolysis. Which would require H+ and water. So the reagent B would be an acid, perhaps HCl or another acid.

So option A has B as HCl. That makes sense because in acidic conditions, nitriles hydrolyze to carboxylic acids.

So looking at the options, option A is A=H3O+ and B=HCl. So that matches both reactions.

Wait, but what about option C? It has A as NaHSO3 and B as HCl. So for the first reaction, A is NaHSO3. Does that make sense? NaHSO3 is a source of H+ (from HSO3^-) and also SO3^2- (sulfite ion). But in the first reaction, the ketone + NaCN with NaHSO3. Could that be a possibility?

Wait, maybe NaHSO3 is acting as an acid, providing H+ to protonate the ketone. So perhaps it's a weaker acid than H3O+. But would that be sufficient?

Wait, but if NaHSO3 is used, what's the pH? Sulfurous acid (H2SO3) is a weak acid. So HSO3^- is a weaker acid than H3O+ (which is very strong). So perhaps in the first reaction, NaHSO3 could provide enough acidity to protonate the ketone. But I'm a bit unsure. Because I thought the typical reagent is H3O+ or H2SO4 for such additions.

But wait, another thought: the first reaction is a cyanohydrin formation. The standard conditions are HCN and H2SO4, or perhaps using NaCN with an acid catalyst like H2SO4 or HCl. So maybe NaHSO3 could work as the acid.

But I'm not too confident. Let me think about the options again. Which options have A as H3O+? Options A and B.

So for the first reaction, if A is H3O+, then the first part is correct. Then the second part: the reagent B is HCl (option A) or CH3COOH (option B). The conversion of nitrile to acid would require a strong acid. Because in the presence of HCl, the nitrile would hydrolyze under acidic conditions to form the carboxylic acid. If B were CH3COOH, which is a weak acid, maybe it wouldn't be strong enough to drive the reaction to completion, especially under aqueous conditions.

So option A has B as HCl, which would effectively carry out the hydrolysis. So option A is looking good.

Wait another thing: the first reaction produces 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So, after adding NaCN and acid, that's the product. Then the second reaction takes that nitrile and converts it to a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but nitriles can also be hydrolyzed under basic conditions with H2O and NaOH, but that would require a strong base. The options for B don't include NaOH, though.

So the second reaction's reagent B is either HCl or acetic acid. HCl is a strong acid, so that would make more sense for the hydrolysis of the nitrile to acid.

So I think that the correct reagents are A = H3O+ and B = HCl, which is option A.

Wait, but looking back, the second reaction is written as (H2O), and B is HCl. So perhaps the conditions are HCl in H2O. That would make sense for the hydrolysis.

So the correct answer should be option A.

The problem involves determining the suitable reagents for two reactions. 

### Reaction 1:
The first reaction involves butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to form 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. This is a cyanohydrin formation reaction, which typically requires acid catalysis. The ketone is protonated by an acid, making it more electrophilic, after which the cyanide ion (CN⁻) attacks the carbonyl carbon. The product is then deprotonated to form the alcohol. Therefore, reagent A must be an acid, such as H₃O⁺, which provides the necessary protons for the reaction. Options A and B, which list A as H₃O⁺, are consistent with this requirement.

### Reaction 2:
The second reaction involves 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacting with reagent B (in the presence of H₂O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. This is the hydrolysis of a nitrile group (-CN) to a carboxylic acid (-COOH). Nitrile hydrolysis to a carboxylic acid typically requires strong acidic or basic conditions. Among the options, HCl (a strong acid) is more suitable for driving this reaction to completion compared to CH₃COOH (a weak acid). Therefore, reagent B should be HCl, as seen in options A and C.

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A**: A = H₃O⁺, B = HCl  
  This matches both reactions. H₃O⁺ is suitable for the cyanohydrin formation in Reaction 1, and HCl is suitable for the nitrile hydrolysis in Reaction 2.  

- **Option B**: A = H₃O⁺, B = CH₃COOH  
  While H₃O⁺ is correct for Reaction 1, CH₃COOH is a weak acid and may not efficiently hydrolyze the nitrile to a carboxylic acid in Reaction 2.  

- **Option C**: A = NaHSO₃, B = HCl  
  NaHSO₃ is a weaker acid compared to H₃O⁺ and may not effectively protonate the ketone in Reaction 1.  

- **Option D**: A = NaHSO₃, B = CH₃COOH  
  NaHSO₃ is unsuitable for Reaction 1, and CH₃COOH is unsuitable for Reaction 2.  

### Conclusion:
The most suitable reagents for both reactions are A = H₃O⁺ and B = HCl, as provided in **Option A**.
