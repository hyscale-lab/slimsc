Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again and make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem is about finding the uncertainty in the P_z operator, given that the system is in an eigenstate of P_x with a specific eigenvalue. The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z, which I think means that the state is expressed in the z-basis.

Hmm, right, the uncertainty in an observable is given by the square root of the variance. The variance is the expectation of the square minus the square of the expectation. So, I need to compute ⟨ΔP_z²⟩ and then take the square root. But wait, for an observable, the uncertainty is sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²).

Wait, but wait. Because the state is already an eigenstate of P_x, which is another operator. Since P_x and P_z don't commute (because they're different components of angular momentum, which don't commute in general), the uncertainty principle tells us there will be some uncertainty here.

Let me jot down the steps I need to take:

1. Find the expectation value of P_z, ⟨P_z⟩.
2. Find the expectation value of P_z squared, ⟨P_z²⟩.
3. Compute the variance: ⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩².
4. Take the square root of the variance to get the uncertainty ΔP_z.

The system's state is given as a column vector: (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). Let me note that down. Let's call this vector |ψ⟩. So,

|ψ⟩ = [ -1/2,
          1/√2,
          -1/2 ]^T

The matrix for P_z is given as a 3x3 matrix with first row [ħ, 0, 0], second row [0, 0, 0], third row [0,0,-ħ]. So,

P_z =
[[ ħ, 0, 0 ],
 [ 0, 0, 0 ],
 [ 0, 0,-ħ ]]

Wait, that's a diagonal matrix. So, the eigenvalues of P_z are ħ, 0, -ħ, corresponding to the basis vectors |+z⟩, |0⟩, |-z⟩. So the basis is ordered as |+z⟩, |0⟩, |-z⟩.

So, since |ψ⟩ is expressed in this basis, each component corresponds to the amplitude in each eigenstate.

So, the first component is -1/2, which is the amplitude for |+z⟩, the second is 1/√2 for |0⟩, and the third is -1/2 for |-z⟩.

Wait, but the state vector is given as a column vector in the P_z basis. So, the components are in the order |+z⟩, |0⟩, |-z⟩.

So, to compute ⟨P_z⟩, which is the expectation value, I can compute ψ† P_z ψ.

But since P_z is diagonal, the expectation value is just the sum of each component squared multiplied by the corresponding eigenvalue. Alternatively, since the state is already in the eigenbasis of P_z, each component's eigenvalue is known. So, the expectation value is:

⟨P_z⟩ = ( (-1/2)^2 ) * ħ + ( (1/√2)^2 ) * 0 + ( (-1/2)^2 ) * (-ħ) )

Wait, wait. Because the state is a vector in the eigenbasis, each component ψ_i is the amplitude for the eigenstate with eigenvalue P_z = eigenvalue_i.

So, for each component in |ψ⟩, the eigenvalue is as follows:

- First entry: |+z⟩ eigenvalue = ħ
- Second entry: |0⟩ eigenvalue = 0
- Third entry: |-z⟩ eigenvalue = -ħ

So, the expectation value is the sum of (ψ_i * eigenvalue_i) * ψ_i^* (since ψ is a column vector, ψ† is a row vector of complex conjugates). But in this case, the given ψ is real, so ψ_i^* is just ψ_i.

So, ⟨P_z⟩ = (ψ_1^2 * ħ) + (ψ_2^2 * 0) + (ψ_3^2 * (-ħ)) )

So let's compute each term:

ψ_1 = -1/2 → ψ_1^2 = (1/2)^2 = 1/4.

ψ_2 = 1/√2 → ψ_2^2 = (1/√2)^2 = 1/2.

ψ_3 = -1/2 → ψ_3^2 = 1/4.

So,

⟨P_z⟩ = (1/4)*ħ + (1/2)*0 + (1/4)*(-ħ)
= ( ħ/4 ) - ( ħ/4 )
= 0.

Interesting, the expectation value is zero.

Now, what about ⟨P_z²⟩? Since P_z is diagonal, P_z squared is the same as the diagonal matrix with each entry squared. That is, the eigenvalues squared.

So, the eigenvalues of P_z are ħ, 0, -ħ. Their squares are ħ², 0, ħ².

So, ⟨P_z²⟩ is the sum of ψ_i^2 * (eigenvalue_i)^2.

So,

⟨P_z²⟩ = (ψ_1^2 * ħ²) + (ψ_2^2 * 0) + (ψ_3^2 * ħ²)
= (1/4 ħ²) + 0 + (1/4 ħ²)
= (2/4) ħ²
= (1/2) ħ²

So, the variance is ⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩² = (1/2 ħ²) - (0)^2 = 1/2 ħ².

The uncertainty is the square root of the variance, so sqrt( (1/2 ħ²) ) = (ħ) * sqrt(1/2) ) = ħ / sqrt(2).

Wait, but let me double-check that. Because sqrt(1/2) is 1/sqrt(2), which is the same as sqrt(2)/2. So, that gives us either 1/sqrt(2) or sqrt(2)/2, which are the same thing.

But the options given are:

A) √2 ħ

B) ħ /√2

C) ħ/2

D) ħ

So, option B is ħ/sqrt(2), which matches our calculation.

But wait, did I make any mistake in computing ⟨P_z⟩? Let's recheck.

Wait, wait. ψ_1 is -1/2, so when I square it, it's 1/4. Multiply by ħ, that's 1/4 ħ.

ψ_3 is -1/2, square is 1/4, multiply by -ħ, so 1/4 * (-ħ) = - ħ/4.

Adding those together, 1/4 ħ - 1/4 ħ = 0. Correct.

For ⟨P_z²⟩, each term is squared, so the sign doesn't matter. Both ψ_1 and ψ_3 contribute (1/4)* ħ² each, sum to 1/2 ħ².

So, variance is 1/2 ħ², so uncertainty is sqrt(1/2) ħ = ħ / sqrt(2). So option B.

But another thought: The state is given as a column vector, but perhaps I should compute it using matrix multiplication.

Alternatively, we can compute ⟨P_z⟩ as ψ† P_z ψ.

Let me compute that.

P_z is the matrix:

[ [ ħ, 0, 0 ],
  [ 0, 0, 0 ],
  [ 0, 0, -ħ ] ]

So, ψ is a column vector:

[ -1/2,
   1/√2,
   -1/2 ]

So, ψ† is a row vector: [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ]

Multiplying ψ† P_z:

First row of P_z is [ ħ, 0, 0 ]

So, ψ† P_z is:

[ (-1/2)*ħ + (1/√2)*0 + (-1/2)*0, 0, 0 ]

Wait, wait, no, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, matrix multiplication: ψ† is 1x3, P_z is 3x3. Their product is 1x3.

So,

ψ† P_z = [ (-1/2)*ħ + (1/√2)*0 + (-1/2)*0,
            (-1/2)*0 + (1/√2)*0 + (-1/2)*0,
            (-1/2)*0 + (1/√2)*0 + (-1/2)*(-ħ) ]

Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no, to multiply ψ† (1x3) with P_z (3x3), each element is the sum of products of the first row of P_z with each element of ψ†, but that might get confusing.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute ψ† P_z ψ, which is a scalar.

So, ψ† P_z ψ = sum_{i,j} ψ_i^* (P_z)_ij ψ_j

Since P_z is diagonal, (P_z)_ij is zero unless i=j.

So, ψ† P_z ψ = sum_i ψ_i^* (P_z)_ii ψ_i

Which is exactly what I did before.

So, for each diagonal element:

i=1: ( -1/2 ) * ħ * ( -1/2 ) → [ (-1/2) * ħ * (-1/2) ] = ħ/4.

i=2: (1/√2) * 0 * (1/√2) → 0.

i=3: (-1/2) * (-ħ) * (-1/2) → (-1/2) * (-ħ) * (-1/2) → (-1/2)(ħ/2) )= -ħ/4.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, (P_z)_33 is -ħ, so it's ( -1/2 ) * (-ħ) * ( -1/2 ) → [ (-1/2) * (-ħ) ] = ħ/2, then multiply by (-1/2) again? No, wait, no, wait.

Wait, (P_z)_33 is -ħ. So, ψ_3 is -1/2. So, ψ_3 * (P_z)_33 * ψ_3 = (-1/2) * (-ħ) * (-1/2) ) → (-1/2) * (-ħ) is ħ/2, multiplied by (-1/2) gives -ħ/4.

Wait, so adding all terms:

i=1: ħ/4

i=2: 0

i=3: -ħ/4

Sum is 0. So, ⟨P_z⟩ is zero.

Same as before.

So, the calculations are correct.

Thus, the uncertainty ΔP_z is sqrt( (1/2) ħ² )= ħ / sqrt(2).

Looking at the options, that's option B.

To determine the uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ of the operator $P_z$, we proceed as follows:

### Key Information:
1. The state of the system is given as the column vector:
   \[
   |\psi\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{1}{2} \\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ -\frac{1}{2} \end{bmatrix}.
   \]
2. The matrix for $P_z$ is diagonal:
   \[
   P_z = \begin{bmatrix} 
   \hbar & 0 & 0 \\ 
   0 & 0 & 0 \\ 
   0 & 0 & -\hbar 
   \end{bmatrix}.
   \]
   The eigenvalues of $P_z$ are $\hbar$, $0$, and $-\hbar$, corresponding to the basis vectors $|+z\rangle$, $|0\rangle$, and $|-z\rangle$.

3. The uncertainty in $P_z$ is given by:
   \[
   \Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
   \]

### Step 1: Compute $\langle P_z \rangle$
Since $|\psi\rangle$ is expressed in the eigenbasis of $P_z$, the expectation value $\langle P_z \rangle$ is:
\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \sum_{i} \psi_i^* (P_z)_{ii} \psi_i,
\]
where $\psi_i$ are the components of $|\psi\rangle$ and $(P_z)_{ii}$ are the eigenvalues of $P_z$. Substituting the values:
- $\psi_1 = -\frac{1}{2}$, $(P_z)_{11} = \hbar$, contribution: $\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 \hbar = \frac{\hbar}{4}$,
- $\psi_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$, $(P_z)_{22} = 0$, contribution: $0$,
- $\psi_3 = -\frac{1}{2}$, $(P_z)_{33} = -\hbar$, contribution: $\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 (-\hbar) = -\frac{\hbar}{4}$.

Adding these contributions:
\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{4} + 0 - \frac{\hbar}{4} = 0.
\]

### Step 2: Compute $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$
The eigenvalues of $P_z^2$ are the squares of the eigenvalues of $P_z$, which are $\hbar^2$, $0$, and $\hbar^2$. Thus:
\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \sum_{i} \psi_i^* (P_z^2)_{ii} \psi_i,
\]
where $(P_z^2)_{ii} = \hbar^2$ for $i=1,3$ and $(P_z^2)_{ii} = 0$ for $i=2$. Substituting the values:
- $\psi_1 = -\frac{1}{2}$, $(P_z^2)_{11} = \hbar^2$, contribution: $\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 \hbar^2 = \frac{\hbar^2}{4}$,
- $\psi_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$, $(P_z^2)_{22} = 0$, contribution: $0$,
- $\psi_3 = -\frac{1}{2}$, $(P_z^2)_{33} = \hbar^2$, contribution: $\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 \hbar^2 = \frac{\hbar^2}{4}$.

Adding these contributions:
\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{\hbar^2}{4} + 0 + \frac{\hbar^2}{4} = \frac{\hbar^2}{2}.
\]

### Step 3: Compute the Uncertainty $\Delta P_z$
The variance is:
\[
\text{Variance} = \langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2 = \frac{\hbar^2}{2} - 0^2 = \frac{\hbar^2}{2}.
\]
The uncertainty is the square root of the variance:
\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar^2}{2}} = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ is $\frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}$, which corresponds to **Option B**.
