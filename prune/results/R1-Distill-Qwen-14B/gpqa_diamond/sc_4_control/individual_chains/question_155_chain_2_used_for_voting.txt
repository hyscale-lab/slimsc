Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's think through it step by step. The question is about finding the uncertainty in the P_z operator given a specific state. 

Wait, the state is given as a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). And the operator P_x has a specific matrix form. Oh right, the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z. So, the state is already expressed in the eigenbasis of P_z. That might make things easier.

So the uncertainty in P_z is the standard deviation, right? The formula is ΔP_z = sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²). But since the state is an eigenstate of P_x, maybe I need to calculate the expectation values of P_z and P_z squared in this state.

Wait, but wait, the state is in the P_z eigenbasis? So the state can be written as a linear combination of the eigenstates of P_z. Each of these would have definite P_z values. Let me think. The eigenvalues of P_z are given by the diagonal elements of its matrix. Looking at P_z's matrix: it's diagonal with entries (ℏ, 0, -ℏ). So the eigenstates are the standard basis vectors, I suppose. Because P_z is diagonal in this basis.

So the given state is a vector in this basis. So each component corresponds to an eigenstate of P_z. Let me see: the state is [ -1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2 ]^T.

So in terms of the eigenstates, the state is a combination of the first, second, and third eigenstates. The eigenvalues for each are ℏ, 0, and -ℏ, respectively.

So the expectation value ⟨P_z⟩ would be the sum of each component multiplied by the eigenvalue. So:

⟨P_z⟩ = (-1/2)*ℏ + (1/sqrt(2))*0 + (-1/2)*(-ℏ)
= (-ℏ/2) + 0 + (ℏ/2)
= 0. Oh, that's interesting. So the expectation of P_z is zero.

Now, what about ⟨P_z²⟩? Since each component's eigenvalue squared is (ℏ)^2, 0^2, and (ℏ)^2. So:

⟨P_z²⟩ = (-1/2)^2 * (ℏ)^2 + (1/sqrt(2))^2 * 0^2 + (-1/2)^2 * (ℏ)^2
= (1/4)ℏ² + 0 + (1/4)ℏ²
= (1/2)ℏ².

So the uncertainty ΔP_z is sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - (⟨P_z⟩)^2 ) = sqrt( (1/2 ℏ²) - 0 ) = sqrt(1/2 ) ℏ = ℏ / sqrt(2).

Wait, but wait, in quantum mechanics, the uncertainty is often written as a positive value. So that would correspond to option B, which is ℏ/sqrt(2).

Alternatively, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the calculations. The state is a vector with components a, b, c. The expectation of P_z is a*ℏ + b*0 + c*(-ℏ). Plugging in: (-1/2)*ℏ + 0 + (-1/2)*(-ℏ) = -ℏ/2 + ℏ/2 = 0. Yeah, that's correct.

For ⟨P_z²⟩, each term is a²*(ℏ²) + b²*0 + c²*(ℏ²). So:

a² = (1/4), c² is also (1/4), so 1/4 + 1/4 = 1/2. Multiply by ℏ², so (1/2)ℏ². The square root is ℏ/sqrt(2).

So the uncertainty is ℏ/sqrt(2), which is option B.

To determine the uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ of the operator $P_z$, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

The given state is expressed as a column vector:

\[
\begin{bmatrix}
-1/2 \\
1/\sqrt{2} \\
-1/2
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvalues of $P_z$ are $\hbar$, $0$, and $-\hbar$, corresponding to the diagonal elements of the $P_z$ matrix. Since the state is already in the eigenbasis of $P_z$, the expectation values $\langle P_z \rangle$ and $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$ can be directly computed from the components of the state.

### Step 1: Compute $\langle P_z \rangle$
The expectation value $\langle P_z \rangle$ is given by:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)\hbar + \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)(0) + \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)(-\hbar).
\]

Simplifying:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = -\frac{\hbar}{2} + 0 + \frac{\hbar}{2} = 0.
\]

### Step 2: Compute $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$
The expectation value $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$ is given by:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 (\hbar)^2 + \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2 (0)^2 + \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 (\hbar)^2.
\]

Simplifying:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{1}{4}\hbar^2 + 0 + \frac{1}{4}\hbar^2 = \frac{1}{2}\hbar^2.
\]

### Step 3: Compute $\Delta P_z$
Using the formula for uncertainty:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}\hbar^2 - 0} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}}\hbar = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

### Final Answer
The uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ is $\frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}$, which corresponds to option **B**.
