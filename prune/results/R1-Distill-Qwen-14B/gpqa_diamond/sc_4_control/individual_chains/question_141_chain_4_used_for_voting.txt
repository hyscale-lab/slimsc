Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. The question is about treating 1-bromobenzene-2-d with NaNH2 in a condensed ammonia solvent. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my reactions, but let me think through this.

First, I need to figure out what the starting material looks like. 1-bromobenzene-2-d... Wait, the 'd' might indicate a deuterium substitution. Oh right, sometimes in these problems, deuterium is used to track reactions, but I'm not sure how it affects the product here. Maybe it doesn't change the reaction mechanism much, just serves as a label.

So the compound is bromobenzene, but where's the bromine? 1-bromo would be on the benzene ring at position 1. Wait, actually, benzene is a six-membered ring. So numbering it, position 1 is one spot, and position 2 is adjacent. So 1-bromobenzene-2-d would have a bromine at position 1 and a deuterium at position 2? Or wait, maybe it's 1-bromo and 2-d, so the substituents are adjacent. That makes sense. So the structure is bromine at position 1, and deuterium at position 2 on the benzene ring. Or wait, maybe it's a benzene ring with bromine at position 1 and another position, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the "2-d" is indicating something else, like di-substituted? Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's focus on the reaction.

The reagent is NaNH2 in condensed ammonia. I remember that NaNH2 is a strong base, often used in deprotonation reactions. In aromatic chemistry, it might be involved in elimination, maybe forming a benzyn intermediate or something like that.

Wait, wait a second. NaNH2 is a strong base and in aprotic solvents like condensed ammonia. One common reaction is the formation of a benzene ring with a triple bond, like a benzyne (aryne) intermediate. When a dihalobenzene reacts with a strong base, it can eliminate two halides to form a triple bond, creating a strained aryne intermediate which is highly reactive.

But wait, in this case, the starting material is only mono-brominated. So how would that work? Oh wait, maybe the deuterium is involved too. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule undergoes some kind of elimination or substitution.

Wait, maybe I should think about the possibility of a substitution. But bromobenzene is typically not very reactive towards nucleophilic substitution because the ring is deactivated by the electron-withdrawing bromine. SNAr (nucleophilic aromatic substitution) usually requires a good leaving group and a strongly activating group, but bromine isn't activating. So perhaps substitution isn't the main pathway here.

Another possibility is elimination. If the compound has adjacent leaving groups, like two bromines, then elimination could form a triple bond. But in this case, the starting material has only one bromine and a deuterium. Wait, but deuterium is a hydrogen isotope. So if the deuterium is at position 2, and bromine at position 1, perhaps they are adjacent. So maybe the base abstracts a proton (deuterium?), leading to elimination of bromide and formation of a triple bond.

Wait, but wait a minute. If we have 1-bromo-2-deutero benzene, and we treat it with a strong base like NaNH2, the base might abstract a proton from the ring, but where? In bromobenzene, the ring is deactivating, so the acidity of the protons is lower than benzene. But maybe in this case, the adjacent deuterium is acidic enough.

Wait, let me think again. The formula is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. So the benzene ring has a Br at position 1 and a D at position 2. So they are adjacent—meta? No, wait, position 1 and 2 are adjacent (ortho). So if the base abstracts the D from position 2, then what happens?

Wait, but deuterium is less acidic than protium, right? So would the base abstract a D? Hmm, maybe not as readily. Or perhaps in this case, because the base is so strong (NaNH2), it can abstract D as well.

Wait a second, I'm confusing deuterium's acidity. Protium has a pKa around 45 in benzene, while deuterium is about 35-40, making it slightly more acidic than regular hydrogens in alkanes. But wait, no, in the case of aromatic rings, the acidity is influenced by the substituents. The Br is an electron-withdrawing group, which would make the adjacent protons more acidic.

In bromobenzene, the ortho and para positions are more acidic than meta. So in this case, the D is at the ortho position relative to Br. So when treated with a strong base, the D might be abstracted, making a benzene ring with Br and a negative charge, but wait, that's not possible. Or maybe it's a different process.

Wait, perhaps the mechanism involves elimination. If the Br and the D are adjacent, maybe the base abstracts the D, and the Br leaves, forming a double bond. But wait, benzene is already a ring of double bonds. Oh, but wait, that's not right. If you eliminate HBr (or DBr?), you form a triple bond, which would be a triple bond in the ring, making it a highly strained but reactive aryne.

But wait, for that to happen, the base would need to abstract a proton adjacent to the bromine. So in this case, the D is at position 2, adjacent to Br at position 1. So if the base abstracts the D at position 2, that would leave a negative charge on the ring, but wait, the Br is a leaving group. So perhaps elimination occurs, forming a triple bond between positions 1 and 2.

Wait, elimination would involve removing H (or D) and the leaving group Br. So if the base abstracts a proton (D) adjacent to the Br, then Br- leaves, and a double bond forms between the two adjacent carbons. But if it's a double bond, it's just a normal substitution. Wait, but that's not possible without a conjugated system. Or perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation to form an alkyne in the ring.

Wait, but benzene can't form a triple bond unless it's a very strained structure. Oh, right, aryne (benzynes) are formed when two adjacent substituents are eliminated, making a triple bond. So for that, the molecule needs two leaving groups adjacent to each other. But in this case, the starting material is 1-bromo-2-d, so only one Br and one D. So maybe the D isn't a leaving group but a proton that's abstracted.

Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let's think about another approach. When benzene has two adjacent leaving groups, like two bromines, treatment with a strong base like NaNH2 leads to elimination of two Br- and formation of a triple bond—a benzyne intermediate. But in this case, we have only one Br and a D. So perhaps the D is a proton that can be abstracted, leading to elimination of Br and formation of a triple bond.

Wait, but D is not a leaving group. Oh, wait, perhaps the base abstracts the D, making a carbanion, and then the Br leaves as Br-? But that would require a good leaving group. Br is a good leaving group, so perhaps that's possible.

So, in step 1, the base (NH2^-) abstracts the D at position 2. So the ring now has a negative charge on the carbon adjacent to Br. But wait, that would be a very unstable situation. Alternatively, perhaps the abstraction of D leads to the departure of Br.

Wait, let's think about the mechanism. If the base abstracts a proton (D), then the corresponding carbon becomes negatively charged. But Br is a good leaving group, so perhaps the adjacent Br leaves, forming a double bond. But that would form a ring with a double bond, but the ring is already conjugated. Wait, but benzene has alternating double bonds, so adding another would cause some rearrangement.

Wait, maybe the elimination leads to a triple bond. So when Br is at position 1, and the D is at position 2, the base abstracts the D, causing the Br to leave. That would form a C≡C bond between positions 1 and 2, making a benzyne intermediate.

But wait, benzyne is a very reactive species, and it's usually not isolated because it tends to dimerize or undergo other reactions. So in the presence of the base, would this benzyne form, and then what happens next?

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed via benzyne because there's only one Br. Wait, another thought: maybe the reaction is a substitution, but that's unlikely because bromobenzene isn't reactive towards nucleophilic substitution under these conditions.

Wait, another possibility: this might be a dehydrohalogenation, but I'm not sure how that would proceed on a benzene ring.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again: the starting material is 1-bromo-2-deutero benzene. Reacting with NaNH2 in ammonia. What's the product?

Wait, another thought: perhaps it's a dehalogenation reaction. If the D is actually a hydrogen, but in this case, it's deuterated. Wait, but NaNH2 is a strong base. Maybe it's abstracting a proton adjacent to the Br, causing elimination of HBr and formation of a double bond.

But wait, benzene has a fully conjugated system. If you form a double bond adjacent to another, it would just rearrange to the aromatic structure. So perhaps that's not the case. Alternatively, maybe the elimination leads to a triple bond, making a benzyne.

Wait, but benzyne is formed when two adjacent leaving groups are present. So in this case, we have only one leaving group and a D. So I'm not sure how the elimination would proceed.

Alternatively, perhaps the D is not involved in the elimination, and the reaction is a substitution. But as I thought earlier, substitution on bromobenzene isn't favorable unless it's activated. So maybe the D is just a spectator in this reaction.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is more about the deuteration. No, that seems unrelated.

Wait, maybe the starting material is 1-bromo-2-dimethylamino benzene or something else, but no, the question states 1-bromobenzene-2-d.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the possibility of a substitution reaction where the NH2^- acts as a nucleophile. But since the ring is deactivated, SNAr is unlikely unless there's a meta-directing group. But in this case, the Br is in position 1, and there's a D in position 2. So perhaps the ring isn't activated enough for substitution.

Wait, another angle: maybe the base abstracts a proton, causing a ring expansion or contraction. But I can't think of a common reaction like that.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is not elimination. Maybe it's a coupling reaction. But I don't think NaNH2 is used for that.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the formation of a benzene ring with a nitro group or something else. No, I'm not connecting it.

Wait, maybe it's an aromatic ring with a substituent that can undergo some kind of elimination. Let me think: if we have bromine and adjacent deuterium, and base is present, perhaps the base abstracts the D, leading to the formation of a carbanion adjacent to Br, which then leaves as Br^- and forms a triple bond.

So the product would be a benzyne, which is a very reactive intermediate. But how does this benzyne react in the presence of NaNH2 and ammonia?

Wait, benzyne can undergo various cycloadditions. Alternatively, it might react with the base or ammonia itself. But in this case, the solvent is condensed ammonia, so maybe the benzyne reacts with ammonia.

Wait, but benzyne is a dieneophile in Diels-Alder reactions, but I'm not sure if that's relevant here.

Alternatively, perhaps the benzyne can undergo ring-opening. For example, when a benzyne is treated with a nucleophile, it can attack the triple bond, leading to different products.

But wait, in this case, the solvent is ammonia, which is a good nucleophile. So perhaps the benzyne can react with ammonia.

Alternatively, maybe the benzyne is unstable and doesn't form, so the reaction doesn't proceed as expected.

Wait, but the starting material is 1-bromo-2-d. So the positions are 1 and 2, meaning the Br and D are adjacent. So when the base abstracts the D, the Br leaves, and a triple bond forms between C1 and C2, making benzyne.

But benzyne is unstable and can undergo various reactions quickly. In the presence of a base like NaNH2 and ammonia, maybe the benzyne can react with ammonia.

Wait, ammonia is a weak nucleophile. But when benzyne is formed, perhaps it can add ammonia across the triple bond.

So if benzyne reacts with ammonia, it could form a substituted benzene with NH2 groups. But how?

Alternatively, perhaps the benzyne can undergo ring-opening to form a diradical or other intermediates, leading to different products.

Wait, considering the benzyne intermediate, when it forms, it's highly strained and reacts quickly. In the presence of a nucleophile like NH2^- (from NaNH2), it can attack the triple bond. But since the triple bond is symmetric, the attack can happen from either side.

So when the benzyne forms, and then NH2^- attacks, it could add across the triple bond, leading to a ring with two amino groups in adjacent positions.

But wait, the triple bond is between C1 and C2 (since they were the positions of Br and D). So the attack would lead to NH2 groups adding to C1 and C2. But let me visualize: when the benzyne forms, it's a linear structure between C1 and C2. The attack would add an amino group to each.

Alternatively, it might form a benzene ring with two amino groups adjacent to each other (ortho positions). So the product would be 1,2-diaminobenzene, also known as o-phenylenediamine.

But wait, considering the reaction conditions, would this be the only product? Or are there other possible products?

Hmm, another possibility is that the benzyne could dimerize, but I think that's less likely in the presence of a nucleophile like ammonia.

Alternatively, maybe the benzyne doesn't form because the reaction isn't feasible with only one Br and one D.

Wait, but wait a second. If the D is at position 2, and the Br is at position 1, then elimination would form a triple bond between 1 and 2, making benzyne. The benzyne would then react with the base to form products.

So the possible products would depend on where the ammonia attacks. Since the triple bond is between 1 and 2, the attack would add NH2 groups to those positions.

But wait, the benzyne can react in two different ways: either the attack is on the same face (syn) or opposite face (anti), but I'm not sure if that affects the product structure. Since the ring is symmetric, the product would be the same.

So the product would be 1,2-diaminobenzene (ortho-diaminobenzene), which is a single product.

Wait, but the question asks how many possible organic products are formed. So if only one product forms, the answer would be 1. But wait, maybe there's another possibility.

Alternatively, perhaps the benzyne can also undergo ring-opening with the base, leading to different products.

Wait, another possibility is that after elimination, the benzyne might not react with ammonia, but perhaps the reaction stops at the benzyne formation, which is a transient intermediate. But in reality, benzyne is very reactive and would quickly react.

Wait, but in the reaction conditions, the only nucleophile available is ammonia, which isn't a strong nucleophile. So maybe the benzyne doesn't react, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the benzyne can add ammonia in two different ways, leading to different products, but I don't think that's the case because the positions are fixed.

Wait, another thought: the starting material could lead to different products depending on the site of elimination. But in this case, the Br and D are adjacent, so elimination is only possible between those two positions. So the benzyne can only form between 1 and 2, leading to only one possible product upon reaction with ammonia.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to more than one product, such as different positional isomers. But I don't think so because the attack on the benzyne is specific.

Wait, but wait. Is there another possibility where the base abstracts a different proton, leading to a different product?

In the starting material, 1-bromo-2-d, the D is at position 2. Are there any other acidic hydrogens on the ring that could be abstracted?

Well, in bromobenzene, the ortho and para positions are more acidic. So positions 3 and 4 (assuming the Br is at 1) would have H's that are more acidic than others. But in the starting material, position 2 has a D, so the H's at positions 3 and 4 are possibly more acidic.

Wait, but the base is NaNH2, which is a strong base. Could it abstract a proton from position 3 or 4, leading to a different elimination?

Wait, if the base abstracts a proton from position 3, which is meta to Br, then elimination of Br would form a triple bond between positions 1 and 3? But that's not adjacent. So elimination would not form a triple bond unless the leaving groups are adjacent.

Wait, no, elimination requires two adjacent leaving groups. Wait, but in this scenario, if the Br is at 1, and the base abstracts a H at position 3, that's not adjacent. So I'm not sure if elimination would occur.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed through elimination but through a different mechanism.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to summarize:

- Starting material: 1-bromo-2-d benzene
- Reagent: NaNH2 in condensed ammonia

The reaction likely forms a benzyne intermediate via elimination of Br and D (but D is not a leaving group). Wait, but D is a proton. Wait, elimination would involve H and Br. So perhaps the D is abstracted by the base, leading to a carbanion, which then eliminates Br^- to form a triple bond.

So the benzyne is formed, which then reacts with ammonia.

The reaction of benzyne with ammonia would result in the addition of amino groups across the triple bond, leading to 1,2-diaminobenzene.

But wait, another possibility: the benzyne could also react with the base (NH2^-) in a different way. Maybe adding two NH2 groups in a meta fashion, but that doesn't make sense because the triple bond is between 1 and 2.

Wait, no, the triple bond is between 1 and 2, so the only possible addition is that the NH2 groups end up at positions 1 and 2, which are adjacent.

So the product would be o-phenylenediamine, which is one unique product.

But wait, is that the only product? Or could there be more than one product?

Wait, another possibility: the benzyne could react in a way that leads to different regiochemistry. But the positions are fixed, so I don't see another possibility.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction doesn't proceed, but that's unlikely because the question implies a reaction occurs.

So, the number of possible organic products would be 1. So the answer would be option B) 1.

Wait, but wait another thought. Could the reaction lead to more than one product due to the possibility of different stereochemistry? But in this case, since the ring is symmetric, the attack from either side would give the same product.

Another angle: perhaps the benzyne could undergo other reactions, like forming a different diaminobenzene isomer. But I don't think that's possible because the positions are fixed.

Hmm, so I think the only product is o-phenylenediamine, so the answer is 1.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The reaction involves treating 1-bromobenzene-2-d with NaNH₂ in condensed ammonia. The starting material, 1-bromobenzene-2-d, has a bromine atom at position 1 and a deuterium atom at position 2 on the benzene ring. The reagent NaNH₂ is a strong base, commonly used to abstract protons (or deuterium) and facilitate elimination reactions.

In this case, the base abstracts the deuterium at position 2, leaving a negatively charged intermediate. Subsequently, the bromine at position 1 acts as a leaving group, leading to the elimination of HBr and the formation of a benzyne (aryne) intermediate. Benzyne is a highly strained and reactive species, characterized by a triple bond between positions 1 and 2 of the benzene ring.

In the presence of ammonia (NH₃) as the solvent, the benzyne reacts with the nucleophile NH₂⁻ (from NaNH₂). The ammonia molecule attacks the benzyne across the triple bond, resulting in the addition of amino groups at positions 1 and 2 of the benzene ring. This produces 1,2-diaminobenzene (o-phenylenediamine) as the final product.

The reaction is highly specific because the benzyne intermediate can only form between positions 1 and 2 (due to the elimination of Br and D). Consequently, the reaction with ammonia leads to a single product, 1,2-diaminobenzene. There are no other possible products because the reaction mechanism is deterministic, and the positions of the substituents are fixed.

Thus, the number of possible organic products in this reaction is **1**.
