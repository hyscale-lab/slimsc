Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, let's see what it's asking for. The question is about finding the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species in the solution.

Alright, the given data is: the concentration of Co(II) is 1e-2 M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16.

Wait, stability constants—right, those are the formation constants for each complex. So βn is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the nth complex. For example, β1 would be the constant for Co(SCN)2^2+ or something? Or wait, maybe β1 is for the first complex, like Co(SCN). Let me think. No, wait, typically, each β represents the stepwise formation. So β1 is the constant for [Co(SCN)]^2+ forming from Co^2+ and SCN^-; β2 would be for adding another SCN to form [Co(SCN)2]^2+, and so on.

So the complexes are Co(SCN)_n^(2-n) perhaps. Wait, let me get the structure right. Each SCN comes in with a -1 charge. So Co^2+ has a charge of +2. Each SCN^- brings -1. So for [Co(SCN)_n]^2+ + n*(-1) = overall charge. So [Co(SCN)_n]^(2-n) is the charge. So the first complex would be Co(SCN), which is [Co(SCN)]^+ (2-1=1+), then [Co(SCN)2]^0 (2-2=0), then [Co(SCN)3]^- (2-3=-1), and [Co(SCN)4]^{2-} (2-4=-2). Wait, but the stability constants given are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So how does that translate into the formation of each complex step by step?

Let me recall: the formation constant for each step is the equilibrium for adding another SCN^- to the complex. So β1 is for the first addition: Co^2+ + SCN^- ↔ [Co(SCN)]^+, with β1 = [ [Co(SCN)]^+ ] / ( [Co^2+][SCN^-] )

Then β2 is the constant for the next step: [Co(SCN)]^+ + SCN^- ↔ [Co(SCN)2]^0, so β2 = [ [Co(SCN)2]^0 ] / ( [Co(SCN)]^+ [SCN^-] )

Similarly, β3 is for [Co(SCN)2]^0 + SCN^- ↔ [Co(SCN)3]^- : β3 = [ [Co(SCN)3]^- ] / ( [Co(SCN)2]^0 [SCN^-] )

And β4 is for [Co(SCN)3]^- + SCN^- ↔ [Co(SCN)4]^{2-}, so β4 = [ [Co(SCN)4]^{2-} ] / ( [Co(SCN)3]^- [SCN^-] )

Wait, but the problem states that the solution contains Co(II) ions and thiocyanate. So, the initial species is Co^2+ and SCN^- in solution.

Now, the question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes. I think, based on what I remember, the blue complex is [Co(SCN)2]^0, which is the dithiocyanato complex (n=2). So, the question is asking for the percentage of [Co(SCN)2]^0 among all Co species.

So to find this, I need to calculate the concentrations of all possible Co-containing species, then find the fraction that is [Co(SCN)2]^0.

The species present are:

- Co^2+ (uncomplexed)
- [Co(SCN)]^+ (monothiocyanato)
- [Co(SCN)2]^0 (dithiocyanato) → this is the blue one we're interested in
- [Co(SCN)3]^- (trithiocyanato)
- [Co(SCN)4]^{2-} (tetrathiocyanato)

So all these species contribute to the total cobalt concentration.

The total cobalt concentration is c(Co) = 1e-2 M. So the sum of all the concentrations of these species must equal 1e-2 M.

The [SCN^-] is 0.1 M.

So, let me denote the concentrations as follows:

Let’s let x be the concentration of [Co^2+], y be [Co(SCN)]^+, z be [Co(SCN)2]^0, w be [Co(SCN)3]^- and v be [Co(SCN)4]^{2-}.

So,

x + y + z + w + v = 1e-2.

We can express each of y, z, w, v in terms of x and the stability constants.

From β1, we have:

y = β1 * x * [SCN^-]

Similarly, from β2, z = β2 * y * [SCN^-]

Wait, no. Wait, the stepwise formation constants are used to build the concentrations of each complex.

Wait, the general approach is to express each species in terms of the previous one and the [SCN^-].

So,

y = β1 * x * [SCN^-]

z = β2 * y * [SCN^-]

w = β3 * z * [SCN^-]

v = β4 * w * [SCN^-]

So, substituting each in terms of x:

y = β1 x [SCN^-]

z = β2 y [SCN^-] = β2 β1 x [SCN^-]^2

w = β3 z [SCN^-] = β3 β2 β1 x [SCN^-]^3

v = β4 w [SCN^-] = β4 β3 β2 β1 x [SCN^-]^4

So all the concentrations can be expressed in terms of x.

So,

Total cobalt concentration:

x + y + z + w + v = x [ 1 + β1 [SCN^-] + β2 β1 [SCN^-]^2 + β3 β2 β1 [SCN^-]^3 + β4 β3 β2 β1 [SCN^-]^4 ] = 1e-2.

We can factor out β1 and compute each term.

Let me compute each term in the bracket step by step.

Given [SCN^-] = 0.1 M.

β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

Compute each term:

Term1: 1

Term2: β1 [SCN] = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9

Term3: β2 * β1 * [SCN]^2 = 40 *9 * (0.1)^2 = 360 * 0.01 = 3.6

Term4: β3 * β2 * β1 * [SCN]^3 =63 *40 *9 * (0.1)^3= 63*40*9= 22680; 22680 * 0.001=22.68

Term5: β4 * β3 * β2 * β1 * [SCN]^4 =16 *63 *40 *9 * (0.1)^4.

Compute 16 *63=1008; 1008*40=40320; 40320*9=362880; multiplied by (0.1)^4=1e-4 → 362880e-4 = 36.288.

So the terms are:

Term1: 1

Term2: 0.9

Term3: 3.6

Term4: 22.68

Term5: 36.288

Adding all terms: 1 + 0.9 =1.9; +3.6=5.5; +22.68=28.18; +36.288=64.468.

So the sum inside the brackets is 64.468.

So,

x * 64.468 = 1e-2 → x = (1e-2) / 64.468 ≈ 1.551e-4 M.

Wait, let me compute that exactly.

1e-2 is 0.01.

0.01 /64.468 ≈ 0.0001551 M.

So x ≈ 1.551e-4 M.

Now, compute each y, z, w, v.

y = β1 x [SCN] =9 * 1.551e-4 *0.1 =9 * 1.551e-5 = 1.3959e-4 ≈1.396e-4 M.

z = β2 * y * [SCN] =40 *1.396e-4 *0.1 =40 *1.396e-5= 5.584e-4 ≈5.584e-4 M.

Wait, wait, no: wait, earlier substitution.

Hold on, wait. From earlier expressions:

z = β2 * β1 * x * [SCN]^2.

Alternatively, y is β1 x [SCN], then z is β2 * y * [SCN], which is β2*(β1 x [SCN]) * [SCN] = β1 β2 x [SCN]^2.

Similarly, z = β2 β1 x [SCN]^2.

So given x=1.551e-4,

z= 40 *9 *1.551e-4 * (0.1)^2.

Wait, compute 40 *9=360; 360 *1.551e-4= 0.055836; 0.055836 * (0.1)^2 = 0.055836 *0.01= 0.00055836 → 5.5836e-4 M.

Same as before.

Similarly, w = β3 * z * [SCN] =63 *5.5836e-4 *0.1=63 *5.5836e-5 = 3.527e-3 M.

Wait, let me compute 5.5836e-4 *0.1 =5.5836e-5. Multiply by 63: 5.5836e-5 *63≈3.527e-3.

And v = β4 * w * [SCN] =16 *3.527e-3 *0.1=16 *3.527e-4 ≈5.643e-3.

Wait, let's compute each step with exact numbers.

Wait, perhaps I should compute each step by substitution.

Wait, maybe let me compute each term step by step.

So, x is 1.551e-4.

y = β1 * x * [SCN] =9 * 1.551e-4 *0.1.

9 *1.551e-4 = 1.3959e-3. Multiply by 0.1: 1.3959e-4 M.

So y=1.3959e-4.

z = β2 * y * [SCN] =40 *1.3959e-4 *0.1.

40 *1.3959e-4 =5.5836e-3. Multiply by 0.1: 5.5836e-4 M.

z=5.5836e-4.

w = β3 * z * [SCN] =63 *5.5836e-4 *0.1.

63 *5.5836e-4 =35.270e-3? Wait, no, 63 *0.00055836=0.035270 (since 5.5836e-4 is 0.00055836). Multiply by 0.1: 0.0035270.

So w=3.527e-3 M.

v = β4 * w * [SCN] =16 *3.527e-3 *0.1.

16 *3.527e-3=56.432e-3. Multiply by 0.1: 5.6432e-3.

So v=5.6432e-3 M.

Now, let's sum all the concentrations:

x=1.551e-4 ≈ 0.0001551

y=1.3959e-4 ≈0.0001396

z=5.5836e-4≈0.0005584

w=3.527e-3≈0.003527

v=5.6432e-3≈0.005643

Add all these up:

0.0001551 + 0.0001396 = 0.0002947

+0.0005584 → 0.0008531

+0.003527 → 0.004380

+0.005643 → 0.0099999, which is about 0.01, which is 1e-2 M. So that checks out.

Now, the question is what's the percentage of z, which is [Co(SCN)2]^0.

So, z is 5.5836e-4 M.

Total cobalt is 1e-2 M.

So the percentage is (z / total) * 100% = (5.5836e-4 / 1e-2) *100.

Compute that:

5.5836e-4 /1e-2 = 0.055836 → *100 =5.5836%.

Wait, that's about 5.58%, but the answer options are 42.3%, 25.6%, 38.1%, 16.9%. Hmm, none of these are close to 5.5%. So that suggests I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait a second, perhaps my initial approach is incorrect. Because I assumed that each β is the stepwise formation, but perhaps the β's are given as the overall formation constants for each complex. Let me think again.

Wait, sometimes, βn is the overall formation constant for the nth complex, which is the product of all previous β's. So for example, β1 is for [Co(SCN)]^+, β2 is for [Co(SCN)2]^0, β3 for [Co(SCN)3]^- etc. So in that case, for [Co(SCN)2]^0, the overall formation constant would be β1 * β2.

But wait, the problem states that the stability constants are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So that would imply that each β is the stepwise constant. So β1 is for the first step, β2 for the second, etc.

Wait, perhaps I should use the overall formation constant for each complex, not the step-wise. Because sometimes, the overall β is given for the entire complex, not the step-wise.

If that's the case, then:

The overall formation constants for each complex would be:

β1 = [Co(SCN)]^+ / ( [Co^2+][SCN^-] )

β2 = [Co(SCN)2]^0 / ( [Co^2+][SCN^-]^2 )

β3 = [Co(SCN)3]^- / ( [Co^2+][SCN^-]^3 )

β4 = [Co(SCN)4]^{2-} / ( [Co^2+][SCN^-]^4 )

But that's not the case. Because if β's are step-wise, then the overall for [Co(SCN)2] would be β1 * β2.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

In the step-wise approach, each βn is the constant for adding the nth ligand. So the overall formation constant for the complex with n ligands is the product of β1 * β2 * ... * βn.

So for [Co(SCN)]^+, the overall K1=β1=9.

For [Co(SCN)2]^0, K2=β1*β2=9*40=360.

For [Co(SCN)3]^- , K3=β1*β2*β3=9*40*63=22680.

For [Co(SCN)4]^{2-}, K4=β1*β2*β3*β4=9*40*63*16= 362880.

So perhaps I should model each complex's concentration using these overall K's.

So let me try that approach.

So the concentrations:

[Co^2+] = x

[Co(SCN)]^+ = y = (K1 * x [SCN^-])

[Co(SCN)2]^0 = z = (K2 * x [SCN^-]^2 )

[Co(SCN)3]^- = w = (K3 * x [SCN^-]^3 )

[Co(SCN)4]^{2-} = v = (K4 * x [SCN^-]^4 )

So, then the total cobalt is:

x + y + z + w + v = 1e-2.

Substituting:

x + K1 x [SCN] + K2 x [SCN]^2 + K3 x [SCN]^3 + K4 x [SCN]^4 = 1e-2.

Factor out x:

x [ 1 + K1 [S] + K2 [S]^2 + K3 [S]^3 + K4 [S]^4 ] = 1e-2.

Compute each term.

Compute K's:

K1 = β1 =9.

K2=9*40=360.

K3=360*63=22680.

K4=22680 *16=362880.

[SCN] =0.1 M.

Compute each term:

1 + 9*(0.1) + 360*(0.1)^2 +22680*(0.1)^3 +362880*(0.1)^4.

Compute each:

Term1: 1.

Term2:9 * 0.1 = 0.9.

Term3:360 * 0.01 = 3.6.

Term4:22680 * 0.001 =22.68.

Term5:362880 * 0.0001=36.288.

Now sum all terms:

1 +0.9=1.9.

+3.6=5.5.

+22.68=28.18.

+36.288=64.468.

So the denominator is 64.468.

So x = 1e-2 / 64.468 ≈1.551e-4 M.

Now, compute each concentration:

y= K1 x [S] =9 *1.551e-4 *0.1=1.3959e-5.

Wait, no: wait, K1 is 9, [S] is 0.1.

Wait, y = K1 x [S] → 9 * 1.551e-4 *0.1.

Wait, 1.551e-4 *0.1 =1.551e-5.

Multiply by 9: 1.3959e-4 M.

z= K2 x [S]^2 →360 *1.551e-4 *0.01.

1.551e-4 *0.01=1.551e-6.

Multiply by 360: 5.5836e-4 M.

Wait, 360 *1.551e-6 =5.5836e-4.

Wait, no, 360 * 1.551e-6 = 0.00055836.

So z=5.5836e-4 M.

w= K3 x [S]^3 →22680 *1.551e-4 * (0.1)^3.

0.1^3=0.001.

1.551e-4 * 0.001=1.551e-7.

Multiply by 22680: 22680 *1.551e-7 ≈0.003526 M.

v= K4 x [S]^4 →362880 *1.551e-4 * (0.1)^4.

0.1^4=1e-4.

1.551e-4 *1e-4=1.551e-8.

Multiply by 362880: approximately 362880 *1.551e-8 ≈5.643e-3 M.

Wait, let me compute:

362880 *1.551e-8 = (362880) * (1.551e-8) = (3.6288e5) * (1.551e-8) = 3.6288 *1.551 * 1e-3.

3.6288 *1.551 is about 5.643.

So 5.643e-3 M.

Now, let's sum all the concentrations:

x=1.551e-4 → 0.0001551

y=1.3959e-4 →0.0001396

z=5.5836e-4 →0.0005584

w=0.003526 →0.003526

v=0.005643 →0.005643

Total:

0.0001551 + 0.0001396 =0.0002947

+0.0005584 →0.0008531

+0.003526 →0.0043791

+0.005643 →0.0099999 (≈0.01 M). Correct.

Now, the question is what's the percentage of z, which is [Co(SCN)2]^0.

z is 5.5836e-4 M.

Total cobalt is 1e-2 M.

So the percentage is (5.5836e-4 /1e-2)*100 = (0.055836)*100 =5.5836% ≈5.58%.

But the options are all higher than that. Hmm, so clearly I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I'm using the wrong β's. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the given β's are the overall formation constants for each complex, not step-wise.

So for [Co(SCN)]^+ , β1=9 is the overall K1 = [Co(SCN)] / ( [Co][SCN] )

For [Co(SCN)2]^0, β2=40 is the overall K2 = [Co(SCN)2] / ( [Co][SCN]^2 )

Similarly, β3=63 is K3= [Co(SCN)3]/( [Co][SCN]^3 )

β4=16 is K4= [Co(SCN)4]/( [Co][SCN]^4 )

In that case, the concentrations would be:

y = β1 x [S]

z = β2 x [S]^2

w = β3 x [S]^3

v = β4 x [S]^4

And then the total is x + y + z + w + v =1e-2.

So let's compute that.

So with [S]=0.1, β's as given.

Compute each term:

y =9 * x *0.1 =0.9 x.

z=40 *x *0.01=0.4 x.

w=63 *x *0.001=0.063 x.

v=16*x *0.0001=0.0016 x.

So x +0.9x +0.4x +0.063x +0.0016x = 1e-2.

Sum the coefficients:

1 +0.9=1.9 → +0.4=2.3 →+0.063=2.363 →+0.0016=2.3646.

So x *2.3646 =1e-2 → x=1e-2 /2.3646 ≈4.226e-3 M.

Then, compute each concentration:

y=0.9 x=0.9 *4.226e-3=3.803e-3.

z=0.4 x=1.690e-3.

w=0.063 x=0.063 *4.226e-3≈2.66e-4.

v=0.0016 x=6.76e-6.

Now, sum them all:

x=4.226e-3 →0.004226

y=3.803e-3 →0.003803 → sum so far: 0.008029.

z=1.690e-3 →0.00169 → sum:0.009719.

w=2.66e-4 →0.000266 → sum:0.009985.

v=6.76e-6 →0.00000676 → total about 0.00999166, which is roughly 0.01 M. So that's correct.

Now, to find the percentage of z, which is [Co(SCN)2]^0.

z=1.690e-3 M.

Total is 1e-2 M.

Percentage: (1.690e-3 /1e-2) *100 =16.9%.

So the answer would be option D) 16.9%.

But wait, the options are:

A) 42.3%

B) 25.6%

C) 38.1%

D) 16.9%

So D is 16.9%, which matches this calculation.

But earlier when I thought the β's were step-wise, I got about 5.58%, which wasn't an option. So perhaps the given β's are the overall constants, not step-wise. That makes sense because in the problem statement, it's stated as "stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63 and β4=16."

Stability constants (β) are generally the overall formation constants, not the step-wise. So I think this approach is correct.

So the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex is 16.9%, which is option D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)₂]⁰, among all cobalt-containing species in the solution, we analyze the equilibrium concentrations of all possible cobalt species. The given stability constants (β₁ = 9, β₂ = 40, β₃ = 63, β₄ = 16) are interpreted as overall formation constants for the complexes. The total cobalt concentration is 10⁻² M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M.

### Key Equations and Approach:
1. **Formation Constants**:  
   - [Co(SCN)]⁺: β₁ = 9  
   - [Co(SCN)₂]⁰: β₂ = 40  
   - [Co(SCN)₃]⁻: β₃ = 63  
   - [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻: β₄ = 16  

   These constants represent the overall formation constants for each complex.

2. **Concentrations of Complexes**:  
   The concentrations of the cobalt species are expressed in terms of the free cobalt ion concentration, \( x \), and the thiocyanate concentration:  
   - \([Co^{2+}] = x\)  
   - \([Co(SCN)]^+ = y = \beta_1 x [\text{SCN}^-]\)  
   - \([Co(SCN)_2]^0 = z = \beta_2 x [\text{SCN}^-]^2\)  
   - \([Co(SCN)_3]^-= w = \beta_3 x [\text{SCN}^-]^3\)  
   - \([Co(SCN)_4]^{2-}= v = \beta_4 x [\text{SCN}^-]^4\)  

3. **Total Cobalt Concentration**:  
   The sum of all cobalt species equals the total cobalt concentration:  
   \[
   x + y + z + w + v = 10^{-2} \, \text{M}.
   \]

4. **Substitute and Solve**:  
   Substituting the expressions for \( y, z, w, v \) into the total cobalt equation:  
   \[
   x \left[ 1 + \beta_1 [\text{SCN}^-] + \beta_2 [\text{SCN}^-]^2 + \beta_3 [\text{SCN}^-]^3 + \beta_4 [\text{SCN}^-]^4 \right] = 10^{-2}.
   \]

   Using \([\text{SCN}^-] = 0.1 \, \text{M}\), compute each term:  
   - \( \beta_1 [\text{SCN}^-] = 9 \cdot 0.1 = 0.9 \)  
   - \( \beta_2 [\text{SCN}^-]^2 = 40 \cdot (0.1)^2 = 40 \cdot 0.01 = 0.4 \)  
   - \( \beta_3 [\text{SCN}^-]^3 = 63 \cdot (0.1)^3 = 63 \cdot 0.001 = 0.063 \)  
   - \( \beta_4 [\text{SCN}^-]^4 = 16 \cdot (0.1)^4 = 16 \cdot 0.0001 = 0.0016 \).

   Summing these terms:  
   \[
   1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646.
   \]

   Solving for \( x \):  
   \[
   x = \frac{10^{-2}}{2.3646} \approx 4.226 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{M}.
   \]

5. **Concentrations of All Species**:  
   Using \( x \), calculate the concentrations of all cobalt species:  
   - \([Co^{2+}] = x = 4.226 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{M}\),  
   - \([Co(SCN)]^+ = y = \beta_1 x [\text{SCN}^-] = 9 \cdot 4.226 \times 10^{-3} \cdot 0.1 = 3.803 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{M}\),
