Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me try to think through it step by step. The question is about selecting the correct reagents for two reactions.

First, looking at the first reaction: butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to form 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. I remember that ketones can undergo various nucleophilic additions. Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? So when it reacts with something like NaCN, which is a source of CN- ions, perhaps it's an addition reaction.

Wait, but the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. That structure would be (CH3)2C(OH)CN. Hmm, how does that form? Oh, maybe it's a condensation reaction or some kind of addition followed by a substitution.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a nucleophilic attack on the ketone. But ketones are generally less reactive than aldehydes towards such attacks. Oh wait, maybe it's the formation of a cyanohydrin. Because I remember that when a ketone reacts with a cyanide (like NaCN), in the presence of an acid catalyst, it forms a cyanohydrin. So the reaction is a hydrocyanation, adding CN- to the carbonyl group.

So the reaction would be: ketone + CN- in acidic conditions to form a cyanohydrin. So the reagent A should be an acid, like H3O+ (which is option A or B). Because the cyanide ion acts as a nucleophile, attacking the carbonyl carbon, and the proton source helps in the proton transfer steps.

So in the first reaction, A is H3O+. So looking at the options, options A and B have H3O+ as A. So that's a clue.

Now the second reaction: the product from the first reaction, 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile, is treated with reagent B (H2O) to give 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. Wait, the nitrile group is being converted into a carboxylic acid.

So how does a nitrile become a carboxylic acid? Oh, I think there's a hydrolysis reaction involved. Nitriles can be hydrolyzed under certain conditions to form carboxylic acids. The typical conditions for nitrile hydrolysis to acid could be strong acidic conditions, like with HCl (HCl in H2O), or perhaps using a strong acid and heat. Alternatively, another possibility is using a base, but under acidic conditions, you get the acid directly.

Wait, another thought: nitrile hydrolysis can occur in two steps. First, to the amide, then to the acid. Or directly to the acid if conditions are harsh enough. Alternatively, using a strong acid like HCl in water would protonate the nitrile, making it more electrophilic, then attack by water would occur.

So in the second step, reagent B is H2O, but the reaction conditions probably involve an acid catalyst. So looking at the options, B must be an acid. The options for B are HCl (in A and C) or CH3COOH (in B and D).

Wait, but in the problem statement, the reagent B is given as H2O. So perhaps the condition is aqueous with acid. So in the second reaction, B is the acid. So if B is HCl (like option A), then the hydrolysis would proceed under acidic conditions.

Wait, but let's think about the options:

Option A: A=H3O+, B=HCl.

So first reaction uses H3O+, which makes sense for the cyanohydrin formation. Second reaction uses HCl as B, which would be in the presence of H2O. So, nitrile to acid using HCl and water? That's possible. Alternatively, if B is CH3COOH, then the hydrolysis might be under milder acidic conditions.

Wait, another thought: sometimes, the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids requires a strong acid and heat, or maybe a base followed by acid workup. Alternatively, another approach is using a strong acid like HCl in water.

But wait, another possibility: Maybe the second reaction is a hydrolysis under basic conditions followed by acidification. But in the question, the reagent B is H2O, but perhaps the solution is acidic. So perhaps the second reaction uses HCl as the acid, which would make sense.

So looking at the options:

Option A: A=H3O+, B=HCl. So both reactions use H3O+ and HCl. But wait, in the second reaction, the reagent is H2O and B, which is HCl, so the solution is acidic.

Alternatively, another option: if B is CH3COOH, which is a weaker acid, would that work? I'm not sure. Because to hydrolyze the nitrile to a carboxylic acid, you usually need strong acidic conditions. Or maybe not necessarily. Another method is using a base (like aqueous NaOH) followed by acid workup, but in the options, the B isn't a base. So perhaps the correct choice is HCl for B.

So putting it together:

First reaction: butanone + NaCN + H3O+ → cyanohydrin (correct reagents are H3O+ so A is H3O+).

Second reaction: nitrile (from the first product) + H2O with HCl (reagent B) → carboxylic acid.

So the correct option would be A: A=H3O+, B=HCl.

Looking at the options, option A is A=H3O+ and B=HCl.

Wait, let me double-check. Are there other possibilities? Could the second reaction be using CH3COOH as B? I'm not sure. Let me think about the conditions for nitrile hydrolysis.

Nitrile hydrolysis to carboxylic acid generally requires a strong acid or a strong base. For example, in acidic conditions, HCl is often used. So using HCl would make sense. So the correct option for B is HCl.

Therefore, the correct option is A: A = H3O+, B = HCl.

The first reaction involves the formation of a cyanohydrin from butan-2-one and NaCN. This reaction requires an acid catalyst to facilitate the nucleophilic attack of CN⁻ on the carbonyl carbon. Among the options, H₃O⁺ (a strong acid) is the suitable reagent for this step, making A = H₃O⁺.

The second reaction involves the hydrolysis of the nitrile group in 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile to form a carboxylic acid. Nitrile hydrolysis to a carboxylic acid typically requires strong acidic conditions. HCl in water is a common and effective reagent for this transformation, making B = HCl.

Considering the options:
- Option A: A = H₃O⁺, B = HCl is consistent with the requirements for both reactions.
- Other options either use incorrect reagents for the first reaction (e.g., NaHSO₃) or for the second reaction (e.g., CH₃COOH, a weaker acid unsuitable for this hydrolysis).

Thus, the correct answer is **A: A = H₃O⁺, B = HCl**.

Answer: A
