Okay, so I've got this question about detecting transiting planets. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The question says there are two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. The researchers want to observe the one with the highest probability of transiting. They're using the transit method, which I remember involves the planet passing in front of its star from our perspective, causing a dip in brightness. The more likely this happens, the higher the probability of detection.

Both planets have been detected via the RV method. So, the RV (radial velocity) method tells us the minimum mass of the planet and its orbital period. Both have the same mass, so that's a given. But Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. So if Planet_2 has a period of P, Planet_1 has P/3.

Wait, orbital period is the time it takes to orbit the star. So shorter period means it's closer to the star. Because Kepler's third law says P² is proportional to a³/(M), where a is the semi-major axis and M is the star's mass. Since Planet_1 is closer, its semi-major axis is smaller. But how does that affect the transit probability?

Also, the host stars: Planet_1's star has twice the mass of Planet_2's. But both stars have the same radius. Hmm. Because if the star is more massive but same radius, it must be hotter or something else. But for transits, the important factors are the size of the planet relative to the star and the inclination of the orbit.

The probability of a transit depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the orbital geometry. The formula I recall is that the probability is approximately R_p / (R_s * a), but wait, no, that's not exactly right. Wait, I think the transit probability is proportional to (R_p / R_s)², but also depends on the orbital parameters.

Wait, another approach. The transit probability is given by the formula (R_p / R_s)² * (1 / (a (1 - e²)^0.5)) )? No, maybe I'm mixing things up. Alternatively, the probability is proportional to (R_p / R_s)² multiplied by (a / (R_s))? No, that doesn't sound right.

Wait, actually, I think the probability is roughly (R_p / R_s)² * (1/(a * sin i)), but I'm not sure. Or maybe it's more about the alignment for the orbit. The key thing is that the probability of transit depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the impact parameter, which relates to the alignment of the orbit.

Wait, I think the probability of a transit is given by (R_p / R_s)² multiplied by (1 / (a * sqrt(1 - e²))), but since these are circular orbits (e=0), the sqrt(1) is 1. So that term is 1/a.

Wait, no, I think I'm getting that wrong. The actual transit probability is the chance that the planet's orbit, as seen from Earth, is aligned such that it passes in front of the star. The formula I remember is:

P_transit ≈ (R_p + R_s)² / (a²) * (1 / (sqrt(1 - e²))) ), but I might be mixing things up.

Alternatively, I think the probability is given by (R_p / R_s)² multiplied by (1 / (a / R_s)), but that doesn't quite make sense. Alternatively, the probability is (R_p / R_s)² multiplied by (R_s / a)^2, but I'm getting confused.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think about the factors that affect the transit probability. There's a higher chance of transit if the planet's orbit is edge-on relative to us. But in reality, the probability is a function of the ratio of the star's size to the distance (orbit) and the planet's size.

Wait, I think the probability is approximately (R_p / R_s)² multiplied by (1 / (a / R_s)). Because a is the semi-major axis, so a/R_s is the ratio of the distance to the star's radius. So the term a/R_s is how far away the planet is in terms of the star's radius. Let me see: if a is small, meaning the planet is close to the star, then a/R_s is small, making the probability higher because 1/(a/R_s) is larger.

Wait, so the probability should be higher when a is smaller, as the planet is closer, so the chance it passes in front is higher. But wait, wait, no. Because the planet's orbit is a circle around the star, the area where the transit can occur is a certain region. The probability depends on the ratio of the area of the star to the area of the planet's orbit. Wait, no, that's not accurate either.

Let me look this up in my notes. Oh wait, I can't actually look anything up, but I'll try to recall. The formula for the transit probability is:

P ≈ (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (a / R_s)).

Wait, that's not dimensionally correct. Let's think differently. The transit probability is  (R_p / R_s)² multiplied by ( (R_s) / a )². Because the area of the orbit (as seen from Earth) is πa², and the area of the star is πR_s². So the probability is approximately (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (R_s / a)^2. Wait, because the chance that the planet's path intersects our line of sight is proportional to the ratio of the star's area (since that's where the transit can happen) compared to the area of the planet's orbit (but wait, the orbit is much larger, so the probability is small).

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

P = (R_p / R_s)² * ( (R_s) / a )²

Wait, that would be (R_p² R_s²) / (R_s² a²) ) = (R_p²)/(a²).

Wait, but that can't be right because it's independent of R_s. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

P ≈ (R_p / R_s)² × (R_s / a)².

Wait, that would be (R_p² / R_s²) × (R_s² / a²) ) = (R_p^2) / (a^2).

But that's the same as before. Hmm.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think about it another way. The transit occurs when the planet's orbital plane is aligned such that it passes in front of the star. The probability of this is related to the relative size of the star and the planet's orbit, as viewed from Earth.

The star's radius is R_s, and the planet's orbital radius is a. The area of the star is π R_s², and the area of the planet's orbit (as seen edge-on) would be π a². The probability that a randomly oriented orbit would result in a transit is roughly (R_p + R_s)^2 / (a^2) ), but since R_p << R_s, it simplifies to (R_p²)/(a²).

Wait, but that would mean the probability is (R_p^2)/(a^2). But in reality, the probability is higher if the planet is closer (smaller a) and/or larger.

But in this question, the planets have the same mass, but their host stars are different. The transit probability also depends on the star's size because R_s is in the denominator.

Wait, but in this question, both host stars have the same radius. Oh, right! The question says that both host stars have the same radii. So R_s is the same for both hosts.

So, let's recap:

- Both planets have same mass.

- Planet_1 has orbital period (P1) = P2 /3. Wait, no, because "the orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than that of Planet_2." So P1 = P2 /3.

- Host star of Planet_1 has twice the mass of Planet_2's host. But both stars have same radii.

We can use Kepler's third law to find the semi-major axis for each planet.

Kepler's third law is P² = (4 π² / G(M + m)) ) a³. Since M >> m (planet mass is much less than star), it's approximately P² = (4 π² a³)/(G M).

So a³ = (G M P²)/(4 π²).

So, for each planet:

a1³ = (G * M1 * P1²) / (4 π² )

a2³ = (G * M2 * P2²) / (4 π² )

But since M1 = 2 M2, and P1 = P2 /3.

So, let's compute a1 and a2.

Let me compute a1³ / a2³ = (G M1 P1²) / (G M2 P2²) ) * (4 π²)/(4 π²) ) → simplifies to (M1/M2) * (P1^2 / P2^2 )

M1 =2 M2, P1 = (1/3) P2.

So:

a1³/a2³ = (2) * [ (1/3 P2)^2 / P2^2 ] = 2 * ( (1/9) P2² ) / P2² ) = 2 * (1/9) ) = 2/9.

So a1³ = (2/9) a2³ → a1 = a2 * (2/9)^(1/3).

What's (2/9)^(1/3)? Let's compute 2/9 is approximately 0.2222. Cube root of 0.222 is around 0.6. Because 0.6^3 is 0.216, which is close to 0.222. So a1 is about 0.6 a2.

So Planet_1 is at a smaller semi-major axis than Planet_2. So a1 = a2 * (2/9)^(1/3) ≈ 0.6 a2.

But wait, let me compute it more accurately. 2/9 = 0.2222. Cube root of 0.2222 is the number x where x^3=0.2222. Let me compute 0.6^3 = 0.216, 0.605^3 ≈ 0.605 * 0.605 = 0.366, 0.366 *0.605≈0.221. So x≈0.605. So a1 ≈ 0.605 a2.

So a1 is smaller than a2, as expected.

Now, the transit probability is (R_p / R_s)^2, but wait, no. Wait, no, I think the transit probability is (R_p / R_s)² multiplied by (R_s / a)^2. Because when a is smaller, R_s/a is larger, so probability increases.

Wait, I'm getting more confused. Let me think again. The probability depends on how likely the planet's orbital plane is aligned with our line of sight. The formula I think is:

P_transit ≈ (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (a / R_s)).

Wait, but that's the same as (R_p^2 / R_s^2) * (R_s / a) ) → (R_p^2 R_s) ) / (a R_s^2 ) → (R_p^2) / (a R_s ).

But in this problem, R_s is the same for both stars (same radii). So the probability becomes proportional to (R_p^2) / (a).

Wait, but since both planets are Earth-like, their radii (R_p) are the same. So R_p is same for both. Thus, the probability is inversely proportional to a.

So P1_transit ∝ 1/a1, P2_transit ∝ 1/a2.

Since a1 is about 0.6 a2, then P1 is (1/0.6) times P2's. 1/0.6 is about 1.666..., so about 1.67 times higher.

So Planet_1 has a higher probability of transiting, approximately 1.65 times higher than Planet_2.

Looking at the options:

Option C) Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher probability.

Option D) Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~2.7 times higher.

Wait, but I thought a1 is about 0.6 a2, so 1/0.6 is 1.666... So 1.65 is close enough. So the correct answer would be C.

Wait, but another way to compute it exactly. Let's compute a1/a2.

a1³ = (2/9) a2³ → a1 = a2 * (2/9)^(1/3).

Compute (2/9)^(1/3):

Take natural logs: (1/3)(ln 2 - ln 9) = (1/3)(0.6931 - 2.1972) = (1/3)(-1.5041) ≈ -0.5014.

Exponentiate: e^(-0.5014) ≈ 0.606.

So a1 ≈ 0.606 a2.

So the transit probability for Planet_1 is (1/a1) = 1/(0.606 a2) ≈ 1.647/a2.

And for Planet_2, it's 1/a2.

So the ratio is 1.647 : 1. So Planet_1 has about 1.65 times higher probability.

Therefore, the researchers would prefer Planet_1, as it has a higher probability. So the correct option is C.

To determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting, we analyze the given parameters:

1. **Key Factors Affecting Transit Probability**:  
   - Transit probability is proportional to the ratio of the planet's radius to the star's radius squared, and inversely proportional to the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.  
   - Since both planets have the same mass and radius, and their host stars have the same radius, the critical factor is the semi-major axis \(a\). A smaller \(a\) (closer planet) increases the transit probability.

2. **Orbital Period and Semi-Major Axis**:  
   - Planet_1 has an orbital period \(P_1 = \frac{P_2}{3}\), meaning it is closer to its host star.  
   - Using Kepler's Third Law, \(P^2 \propto a^3 / M\), where \(M\) is the star's mass:  
     \[
     \frac{a_1^3}{a_2^3} = \frac{M_1 P_1^2}{M_2 P_2^2}.
     \]  
     Substituting \(M_1 = 2M_2\) and \(P_1 = \frac{P_2}{3}\):  
     \[
     \frac{a_1^3}{a_2^3} = \frac{2 \cdot \left(\frac{P_2}{3}\right)^2}{M_2 \cdot P_2^2} = \frac{2}{9}.
     \]  
     Taking the cube root:  
     \[
     \frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left(\frac{2}{9}\right)^{1/3} \approx 0.605.
     \]  
     Thus, \(a_1 \approx 0.605a_2\), meaning Planet_1 is closer to its host star.

3. **Transit Probability Ratio**:  
   - Transit probability is inversely proportional to the semi-major axis:  
     \[
     \frac{P_{\text{transit,1}}}{P_{\text{transit,2}}} = \frac{a_2}{a_1}.
     \]  
     Substituting \(a_1 \approx 0.605a_2\):  
     \[
     \frac{P_{\text{transit,1}}}{P_{\text{transit,2}}} = \frac{1}{0.605} \approx 1.65.
     \]  
     Therefore, Planet_1 has approximately 1.65 times the transit probability of Planet_2.

4. **Conclusion**:  
   - Planet_1 is closer to its host star, resulting in a higher transit probability. The researchers should prioritize observing Planet_1.
