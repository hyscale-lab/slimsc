Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about optical isomerism in organic compounds. Hmm, I need to figure out which of the given compounds exhibit this property. Let me try to break it down.

First, what's optical isomerism? Oh right, it's when a compound has chiral centers, meaning they're non-superimposable mirror images. These can't be identical because of the arrangement of substituents around a carbon atom. So, the presence of chiral centers usually leads to optical isomerism.

Looking at the options given:

1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate
2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate
3. benzophenone
4. dimethyl fumarate

I need to check each for possible chiral centers or other sources of stereoisomerism.

Starting with option 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Let me visualize the structure. Biphenyl means two benzene rings connected by a single bond. The substituents are at the 2 and 6 positions on each ring. Wait, the positions are 2,2'- and 6,6'. So on each benzene ring, there are two substituents: a nitro group and a carboxylate ester group. Since biphenyls can have different configurations based on the rotation around the central bond, this might lead to cis or trans isomerism. But wait, can that cause optical isomerism? Hmm, no, because cis and trans would be diastereomers, not enantiomers. Optical isomerism requires a chiral center or some other form of asymmetry leading to non-superimposable mirror images. If the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it can't be chiral. Let me think: If the substituents are arranged symmetrically, then no. So in this case, the nitro groups are on each ring at 6 positions. The carboxylate esters are at 2. So each ring has a nitro, a carboxylate, and the central bond. Wait, maybe the arrangement around each ring leads to a chiral center. Or perhaps the biphenyl system has axial chirality? Oh wait, biphenyls can have a form of chirality if the substituents are arranged in a way that makes the molecule non-symmetric. So if the substituents on each ring are in such a way that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, it can have enantiomers. For example, if the groups on each ring are arranged differently, leading to a lack of internal plane. So if the substituents on each ring are in positions that don't mirror each other, then the molecule could be chiral. Alternatively, maybe the two rings each have two substituents which create a chiral center. Wait, but each substituent is on the benzene ring; benzene is sp² hybridized. So each substituent is attached to the ring, which is planar. So the carbons where substituents are attached are not chiral centers. Unless there's a central carbon where multiple substituents are attached.

Wait, the molecule is dimethyl, so the ester groups are OMe (methyl esters) attached to the 2 and 2' positions. And nitro groups are at 6 and 6'. So each ring has two substituents, each at the 2 and 6 positions. So each ring is like having a nitro, a carboxylate ester, and another substituent? Wait, no, each ring has two substituents: one nitro and one ester. Wait, no, the formula is [1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate, so each phenyl has a carboxylate at position 2, and also a nitro at 6? So each ring has a nitro at position 6 and a COOCH3 at 2. So each substituent is on the phenyl ring.

Wait, but the biphenyl system has two rings connected by a single bond. The substituents are on each ring in the 2 and 6 positions. So for each ring, the substituents are at 2 and 6. Wait, if the substituents are in the meta positions (like 2 and 6 are meta for each ring?), but wait, on a benzene ring, positions 1, 2, 3, etc., are adjacent. So 1 is attached to 2 and 6, right? So substituents at 2 and 6 would be adjacent to position 1, meaning they are para to each other. Wait, no, if the ring has substituents at 2 and 6, that's adjacent to the point where it's connected to the other ring. Wait, maybe each ring has substituents at 2 and 6 positions, but the biphenyl is connected via the 1 position of each ring.

Oh, I'm getting a bit confused. Alternatively, perhaps each ring has two substituents: a nitro and a carboxylate ester. If the substituents on each ring are in positions that create a chiral axis or make the entire molecule chiral, then it would have optical isomers.

Alternatively, perhaps the two substituents on each ring are arranged symmetrically. If the substituents on each ring are in such a way that the entire molecule has a plane of symmetry, then no, it's not chiral. But if the substituents create a lack of symmetry, then the molecule could be chiral.

Wait, but if each ring has a nitro and a carboxylate, but their positions are such that the arrangement across the biphenyl is not a mirror image, then maybe the molecule is chiral. Alternatively, maybe the two rings each have two substituents but arranged in a way that leads to axial chirality. Axial chirality occurs when there are two substituents on each of the two connected rings, and their arrangement around the central bond is such that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry. For biphenyls, this often leads to the possibility of being a meso compound or having enantiomers.

Wait, I'm not entirely sure about this one. Let me think about another approach. If I can determine whether the molecule has any chiral centers or other sources of asymmetry. For example, if the molecule has a carbon with four different substituents, that's a chiral center, leading to optical isomerism.

In option 1, each substituent is on the benzene ring. Benzene is sp², so the carbons where substituents are attached don't have four different groups. So no chiral centers there. So maybe the molecule doesn't have any chiral centers, but perhaps another form like axial chirality.

Wait, axial chirality is when the central axis has different groups on either side. For example, in allenes or biphenyls. So in biphenyls, if the substituents on each ring are arranged in a way that makes the two halves mirror images or not. If they are mirror images, then the molecule is achiral. If not, then the molecule is chiral.

So in this case, the substituents on each ring: each ring has a nitro group and a carboxylate ester. Let's say the nitro is at position 6 and the ester at 2 on each ring. Since the rings are connected by a single bond, the substituents could be arranged in a way that creates a chiral axis.

Wait, but if both rings have the same substituents in the same positions, then the two rings would mirror each other. So for instance, if ring A has a nitro at 6 and ester at 2, and ring B has a nitro at 6 and ester at 2, but the arrangement around the central bond is such that the substituents on each side are mirror images, then the molecule would be achiral (meso compound) or could it be that they can rotate into each other, leading to no isomerism?

Alternatively, if the substituents are arranged such that rotating one ring relative to the other doesn't produce the same arrangement, then the molecule would have optical isomers. Hmm, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should move on and come back to it.

Option 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Let's write the structure. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO- with the methyl ester. 2-hydroxypropanoate would have the hydroxyl on the second carbon. So structure is CH2CH(OH)COOCH3. Wait, so the structure is CH3-C(OH)(O2C-OCH3)-CH3. Wait, no, propanoate is CH2CH2COO-, but 2-hydroxy would be on the middle carbon. So the structure would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3? No, wait, propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. So 2-hydroxypropanoate would be HOCH2CH2COOCH3. Wait, no, wait, propanoate is CH2CH2COO-; the chain is CH2-CH2-COO-. So 2-hydroxy would be on the second carbon, so structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the structure is: the carbon chain is CH2(OH)-CH2-CO-OCH3.

Wait, no, wait: propanoate is CH3CH2COO- as the ester when it's methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. Wait, no, wait. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. So propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would be CH2(OH)CH2COOH. So the ester would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Now, looking for chiral centers. The middle carbon (CH2(OH)CH2-) is attached to what? Let's see: the CH2(OH) is the second carbon. Wait, no, the structure is: the molecule is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3? Or is it CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3? Wait, maybe I should draw the structure. Let me think:

The structure is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO-, so 2-hydroxy would be on the middle carbon.

So the structure would be: the carboxylic acid group is on the third carbon (COOCH3), the second carbon has the hydroxyl group, and the first carbon is CH3. Wait, no. Wait, perhaps it's:

Carbon 1: CH2(OH)
Carbon 2: CH2-
Carbon 3: COOCH3

Wait, that can't be right. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

Carbon 1: CH3
Carbon 2: CH(OH)
Carbon 3: COOCH3

Wait, that would make it 2-hydroxypropanoate. So the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

So the middle carbon (CH(OH)) is attached to:

- CH3 (carbon 1)
- OH
- COOCH3 (carbon 3)
- And a hydrogen (since it's CH(OH) with three substituents? Wait, no, actually, a carbon can't have four bonds if it's CH. Wait, wait, no. Let me think again. The middle carbon is CH(OH), but that's only three substituents. Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think about the actual structure.

Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. The acid is CH3CH(OH)COOH. The ester would replace the -OH of the acid with OCH3, so it would be CH3CH(OH)COOCH3.

So the structure is:

CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

So the central carbon (the second carbon) is attached to:

- CH3 (from the first carbon)
- OH group
- COOCH3 (from the third carbon)
- And a hydrogen.

Wait, no, the central carbon is CH, so it's CH attached to three groups: CH3, OH, and COOCH3. That's three substituents, plus a hydrogen. So that's four in total: CH(OH)(CH3)(COOCH3)(H).

Wait, no, wait: no, the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So the CH(OH) is attached to two CH3 groups? No, no. Let me draw it properly:

Carbon chain: Carbon 1 is CH3, Carbon 2 is CH(OH), Carbon 3 is COOCH3.

So Carbon 2 is CH(OH) connected to Carbon 1 (CH3), Carbon 3 (COOCH3), and a hydrogen.

Wait, that's three substituents. Unless I'm missing something, perhaps the structure is more like:

O
||
O-C-OCH3

So the second carbon is CH(OH), attached to CH3, COOCH3, and H. That's three substituents plus the OH. Wait, no, in that case, the four substituents would be:

- CH3 (from Carbon 1)
- OH
- COOCH3 (from Carbon 3)
- and a hydrogen.

Wait, so that gives four different groups attached to the central carbon (CH(OH)). So the central carbon has four different substituents: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and H. Therefore, this carbon is a chiral center. So methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate does have a chiral center, which means it can exhibit optical isomerism. So option 2 can have optical isomerism.

Moving on to option 3: benzophenone. Benzophenone is (phenyl)2CO, right? The structure is two benzene rings attached to a ketone group. So the structure is Ph-C(=O)-Ph. Now, the central carbon is connected to two phenyl groups, a carbonyl group, and another substituent. Wait, the central carbon is in the ketone. Let's see: the carbonyl group is C=O, so the carbon in the ketone is double-bonded to oxygen, so it's sp² hybridized. So, the central carbon (the carbonyl carbon) is attached to two phenyl groups and a double-bonded oxygen. So the substituents are O (as double bond), Ph, Ph, and then maybe another substituent. Wait, no, the structure is Ar-C(=O)-Ar, so the carbon is bonded to two Ar groups (each benzene), a carbonyl O (double bond), and another single bond? No, wait, no. Wait, the carbonyl group is O=C-O? No, benzophenone is Ar-CO-Ar, so the structure is Ar-C(=O)-Ar. So the central carbon is the C in the ketone. It has a double bond to O, and two single bonds to each Ar group. So the substituents are two phenyl groups, a carbonyl group (which is a double bond, so no), and a hydrogen? No, wait, in benzophenone, the structure is (Ph)₂CO, meaning the central carbon is bonded to two phenyl groups and a carbonyl oxygen. Wait, but the carbonyl is O=C-, so the carbon has two phenyl groups attached, a double bond to O, and no other substituents. So the substituents are two phenyl groups, a carbonyl O (double bond), and a hydrogen? No, wait, wait: the structure is Ph-C(O)-Ph. So the central carbon is attached to two phenyl groups (each Ph), one O (double bond), and another substituent. Wait, no, wait: the central carbon is in the ketone, so it's double bonded to O. So the substituents are two phenyl groups and a double bond to O. So that's three substituents. Wait, but the carbon can't have four bonds if it's double bonded. Wait, no, the central carbon is connected to two phenyl groups, a carbonyl oxygen (double bond), and another phenyl? No, that can't be. Wait, wait, the structure is (Ph)₂CO, so the central carbon is bonded to two phenyl groups and a carbonyl oxygen. How many bonds? The central carbon is bonded to two phenyl groups (each single bond), a double bond to O, and has no other substituents. So that's three bonds. Wait, that's only three bonds, so something's wrong because carbon has four bonds.

Ah, I see my mistake. Benzophenone is (Ph)₂CO, where the central carbon is connected to two phenyl groups and a carbonyl group. But the carbonyl is a C=O, so the central carbon is double-bonded to O. So the four bonds are:

- Two single bonds to phenyl groups.

- One double bond to O.

Wait, that's three bonds. So where's the fourth? Oh, wait, no. The carbonyl group is O=C-Ph, but in benzophenone, it's two phenyl groups attached to the same carbon, which is double-bonded to O. So the structure is:

Ph–C(=O)–Ph.

So the central carbon (the ketone carbon) is connected to two phenyl groups, a double bond to O, and another substituent. Wait, no, that can't be. Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the structure. Wait, no, benzophenone has the structure Ar–C(=O)–Ar, where Ar is aryl (like phenyl). So the central carbon is bonded to two aryl groups and a carbonyl oxygen. So bonds are: two single bonds to aryl, one double bond to O. But that's only three bonds. So where is the fourth bond? Oh, wait, perhaps I'm thinking of the wrong structure. Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the actual connectivity. The central carbon is bonded to two phenyl groups and the carbonyl oxygen. So that's three substituents, but carbon needs four. So maybe I'm wrong.

Wait, let me think again. Benzophenone is diphenyl ketone. The structure is two phenyl groups attached to a ketone group. The ketone group is O=C-. So the central carbon is the carbonyl carbon. So it's:

Ph–C(=O)–Ph.

So the central carbon is double bonded to O, and each of the two other bonds is to a phenyl group. So that's three bonds, but carbon usually has four. Oh wait, no, wait: the central carbon is the carbonyl carbon, which is double bonded to O, and connected to two phenyl groups. So the structure is:

Ph–C(=O)–Ph.

Wait, but that's three substituents. How? Because the carbon must have four bonds. Wait, perhaps I’m making a mistake here. Let me think of the actual molecular structure. The molecule is (Ph)₂CO. The central carbon is part of the carbonyl group. So it's connected to two phenyl groups and a double bond to oxygen. Wait, so that's three bonds. But that's impossible because carbon can't have three bonds in that way. Oh wait, perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong. Alternatively, maybe the central carbon is connected to two phenyl groups, one oxygen (as in O=C-O?), but that would be a different structure.

Wait, no, another possibility: perhaps the central carbon is connected to two phenyl groups, one oxygen (as double bond), and another hydrogen. But that would imply the structure is Ph₂C(OH)O, which doesn't make sense. Hmm, I'm getting stuck here. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is Ar-C(=O)-R, where R is another Ar group. So benzophenone has:

O
||
C
Ph–C(=O)–Ph.

So the central carbon is bonded to two phenyl groups via single bonds, and a double bond to O. So that's three bonds. But carbon needs four. Oh! Wait, I think I'm mixing it up. The carbonyl group is O=C–, so the central carbon has a double bond to O and single bonds to two phenyl groups. So that's three single bonds (two to phenyl, one to O as double). But no, double bonds count as one bond. So the central carbon has two single bonds to phenyl groups, one double bond to O, and one more single bond? Or does it have a lone pair? No, that can't be.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about whether benzophenone has a chiral center. If the central carbon is part of a ketone, then it's sp² hybridized and double-bonded to O. So it's not a chiral center because it's not tetrahedral. So benzophenone doesn't have any chiral centers, and it's symmetric. The two phenyl groups are identical, so the molecule has a plane of symmetry. Therefore, it can't be chiral, so no optical isomerism. So option 3 does not exhibit optical isomerism.

Moving on to option 4: dimethyl fumarate. Fumaric acid is a diacid with the structure HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. The dimethyl ester would be MeOOC-CH=CH-COOMe. So the structure is CH2(COOCH3)–CH2–(COOCH3), but wait, no, fumaric acid is HO₂CCH=CHCO₂H, so the ester would be MeOOCCH=CHCOOCH3. So the molecule is MeOOC-CH=CH-COOCH3. Now, checking for chiral centers or any other form of stereoisomerism.

Wait, in fumarate, the double bond is between the two CH groups. So the structure is CH₂(COOCH3)-CH2-COOCH3 with a double bond in the middle. Wait, no, wait: fumaric acid is HO₂CCH=CHCO₂H. So the dimethyl ester would be MeOOC-CH=CH-COOCH3. So the molecule has a central double bond (CH=CH), and each end has a COOCH3 group.

Now, considering the geometry around the double bond. Fumarate has a trans configuration, I think. Wait, but wait, fumaric acid is the trans isomer of maleic acid. Wait, no, maleic acid is the cis isomer, and fumaric is the trans. So in dimethyl fumarate, the groups on either side of the double bond are arranged trans.

But wait, how does that affect optical isomerism? Wait, the double bond in fumarate is between two carbons, each connected to two ester groups. So each CH has two COOCH3 groups attached. So the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
   \
    C=C
   /
O-C-OCH3
       O

Wait, no, perhaps I should draw it properly. The structure is:

COOCH3
     \
C=C
     /
COOCH3

Wait, no, the structure is CH₂(COOCH3)=CH(COOCH3). No, wait, that's not right. Let me think again: fumarate is the trans-diaconate ester. So the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond.

Now, the question is whether this compound exhibits optical isomerism. Since the double bond is in the middle, and each CH is attached to two ester groups, the molecule may have E or Z configuration, but that's geometric isomerism, not optical isomerism.

Wait, but can the molecule have a plane of symmetry? Let's see: if the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides of the double bond (trans), then the molecule might be symmetrical. Alternatively, perhaps each carbon in the double bond is attached to two identical groups, making the molecule achiral.

Wait, each CH in the double bond is attached to two COOCH3 groups. So each of the double-bond carbons has two identical substituents (COOCH3). So in that case, the molecule would have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. Therefore, it can't have optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait, if each double bond carbon has two identical groups, then the molecule is symmetrical. So dimethyl fumarate has a center of symmetry. For example, each ester group is on opposite sides of the double bond, leading to a symmetry that makes the entire molecule achiral. So no optical isomerism here.

Wait, but wait another thought: if the substituents on each double bond carbon are the same, then the molecule is not chiral. Because if you can draw a plane or a mirror through the molecule that makes both halves identical, then it's not chiral. So in this case, since each carbon in the double bond has two identical substituents (COOCH3), the molecule is symmetrical, and thus not chiral. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate does not exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait again—let me think about the structure. The molecule is MeOOC-CH2-CH2-COOCH3? No, no, it's MeOOC-CH=CH-COOCH3. So each CH in the double bond is connected to one COOCH3 and two hydrogens? No, wait. No, each CH is in the middle of a double bond, so each has two substituents attached. Wait, no, each CH in the double bond is bonded to two COOCH3 groups and two Hs? No, wait, no. Let me think again.

Wait, the structure of fumarate is (Z) or (E)? No, fumarate is the trans isomer. So it's E configuration. So the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. So for dimethyl fumarate, each CH is connected to one COOCH3 group and the other substituents.

Wait, perhaps each CH in the double bond is connected to one COOCH3 group and another hydrogen? No, wait, no. Let me clarify.

The structure of fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. So the central double bond is between the two CH groups. Each CH is connected to a COOH group on one side and a H on the other. So the structure is:

HOOC–CH=CH–COOH.

In the trans configuration, the two COOH groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. So when you make the dimethyl ester, it becomes:

COOCH3
     \
C=C
     /
COOCH3

But wait, each CH in the double bond is connected to two COOCH3 groups. No, each CH has one COOCH3 on each end. Alternatively, perhaps each CH is connected to a COOCH3 and a hydrogen. No, wait, no—each CH is a central carbon in the double bond, connected to two other carbons (the ones from the COOCH3 groups). Wait, perhaps each CH is connected to two COOCH3 groups, making it a symmetrical structure.

Wait, no, each CH in the double bond is connected to one COOCH3 on each end. Oh, wait, perhaps each carbon in the CH=CH is connected to a COOCH3 group. So the double bond is between two carbons, each of which has a COOCH3 group attached. So the structure is:

COOCH3-CH₂-CH₂-COOCH3, but with a double bond. No, that's not right. The correct structure is:

COOCH3
   \
C=C
   /
COOCH3

Wait, but each CH in the double bond is connected to two COOCH3 groups, making the molecule symmetrical. So each carbon in the double bond has two identical substituents (COOCH3), so the molecule has a plane of symmetry. Thus, it's not chiral and doesn't exhibit optical isomerism. So option 4 doesn't have optical isomerism.

Wait, but I thought earlier that option 4 could have cis or trans isomerism, which is about geometric isomerism, but not optical isomerism. So in this case, dimethyl fumarate is the trans ester, but that doesn't make it chiral. So no optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait, another thought: what if the double bond is not symmetric? Let me think. If each CH is connected to a COOCH3 and a hydrogen, then the structure would be COOCH3-CH2-CH2-COOCH3 with a double bond. No, that's not right. Wait, maybe each CH has a COOCH3 and a hydrogen. So the structure is CH2(COOCH3)=CH2(COOCH3). No, that can't be right either.

Hmm. I'm a bit stuck on this. Let me try another approach. If the two substituents on each carbon of the double bond are the same, then the molecule is symmetrical. In dimethyl fumarate, each carbon of the double bond is connected to two COOCH3 groups, so that would make the molecule symmetrical across the double bond. So it's not chiral. Therefore, no optical isomerism.

So, compiling my findings:

1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate: I'm not entirely sure, but I think it may have axial chirality. If the substituents on each ring are arranged asymmetrically, then the molecule could be chiral. Alternatively, if the arrangement is symmetric, it's not. But I'm not certain. Let me think again: each ring has a nitro and a carboxylate ester. The positions are 6,6' and 2,2'. So each ring has substituents at positions 2 and 6, which are para to each other. Thus, each ring would have two substituents opposite each other. If the substituents on each ring are at para positions, then the two rings would have their substituents arranged in a way that perhaps the entire molecule is symmetrical. But wait, if the substituents on each ring are in the same relative positions, but their arrangement on each ring leads to an asymmetrical overall structure. For example, if the nitro groups are on the same side of each ring, then the molecule could have axial chirality.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry. Each ring has the same substituents in the same positions. So the molecule could be symmetrical, making it achiral. Thus, no optical isomerism.

Wait, but biphenyls can be chiral if the substituents are arranged in a way that no plane of symmetry exists. For example, if the substituents on each ring are in such a way that rotating the molecule doesn’t produce the same arrangement. So, for instance, if each ring has substituents at 2 and 6, but arranged in a way that their positions relative to the central bond are not mirror images, the molecule could be chiral.

Wait, but given that both rings have the same substituents in the same positions, perhaps the molecule is symmetrical. For example, if each ring has a nitro at 6 and a carboxylate at 2, then rotating the molecule 180 degrees around the central bond would make both rings mirror images. So the molecule would have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. Thus, no optical isomerism.

So, option 1 is not chiral.

So, the only compound that exhibits optical isomerism is option 2, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, which has a chiral center. Wait, but looking back at the options, the options provided are:

A) 1, 2 and 4
B) 3 and 4
C) 2 and 3
D) 1 and 2

Wait, according to my analysis, only option 2 (methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate) has optical isomerism. But looking back, I think I made a mistake with option 4.

Wait, option 4 is dimethyl fumarate. Wait, if the substituents on each end are the same, the molecule is symmetrical, but what if the substituents are in a trans configuration?

Wait, perhaps dimethyl fumarate is a trans-diesters, which would have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. So no optical isomerism.

Wait, but another possibility: perhaps the molecule is a diastereomer, but that's not optical isomerism.

So, based on this, only option 2 exhibits optical isomerism. But looking at the options, none of them have only option 2. Let me check the options again.

Options:
A) 1, 2 and 4 → 3 compounds
B) 3 and 4 → no
C) 2 and 3 → no
D) 1 and 2 → no

Wait, but according to my analysis, only option 2 is correct. So perhaps I missed something.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with option 4. Let me think again. Dimethyl fumarate: structure is MeOOC-CH=CH-COOCH3, with E configuration. Each CH has two COOCH3 groups. So the molecule is symmetrical because each CH has the same groups. So, in this case, it's not chiral.

Hmm, but another thought: sometimes, even if each substituent is the same, the molecule could be chiral if the arrangement creates a lack of symmetry elsewhere. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule isn't symmetrical because the substituents are on opposite sides of the double bond, but each substituent is the same.

Wait, perhaps the molecule has two identical groups on each end, making it symmetric. So, it's not chiral. So, no optical isomerism.

So, in that case, only option 2 has optical isomerism. But looking at the options, the only option that includes 2 is option A and D. But option A includes 1 and 4 as well, which I don't think are correct. Option D includes 1 and 2. So in this scenario, according to my analysis, only option 2 is correct, but the options don't include a choice that only has 2.

Wait, did I make a mistake with option 4?

Wait, another angle: perhaps dimethyl fumarate is a diastereomer but not an enantiomer, so it doesn't exhibit optical isomerism. Or perhaps it does have a chiral center elsewhere.

Wait, no, the central part is the double bond. The carbons are connected via double bonds, so they're sp² hybridized. So no chiral centers there. So, no.

Wait, perhaps I missed something in option 1. Let me think again.

Option 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

Each ring has:

- Nitro group at position 6
- Carboxylate ester at position 2

The biphenyl system is connected at the 1 and 1' positions.

The substituents on each ring are at positions 2 and 6, which are para to each other on each ring.

Now, considering the arrangement around the central bond. Each ring has substituents in positions 2 and 6, which are across from each other on the ring. So, if the substituents on both rings are in the same relative positions, the molecule would have a plane of symmetry. For example, if the nitro groups are on the same side of each ring, and the ester groups on the opposite side, then the molecule could be symmetrical.

But if the nitro groups are on opposite sides relative to the central bond, then the molecule would lack symmetry, leading to chirality.

Wait, but in this case, are the substituents arranged symmetrically or not? Let me imagine looking at the molecule. If both rings have their nitro groups in the same orientation relative to the central bond, then the molecule is symmetrical. If not, it's asymmetrical.

Wait, but in the case of biphenyls, sometimes the arrangement can lead to axial chirality. So, if the substituents on each ring are arranged in a way that they can't be mirrored across the central bond, the molecule would be chiral.

But in this case, the substituents are at 2 and 6 positions, which are para. So for each ring, the substituents are opposite each other. So if both rings have their substituents arranged in the same way, the molecule would have a plane of symmetry. But if the substituents on each ring are in a different orientation relative to the central bond, then the molecule is chiral.

Wait, but the way the substituents are placed can lead to either a symmetrical or asymmetrical arrangement. So, for example, if the nitro groups on each ring are on the same side of the central bond, the molecule would have a plane of symmetry. But if they are on opposite sides, then it's asymmetrical.

Wait, but the question is about whether the molecule can exhibit optical isomerism. That is, whether it has a chiral form.

So, if the molecule can exist as two enantiomers, then it exhibits optical isomerism.

In biphenyl systems, if the substituents are arranged asymmetrically, the molecule can be chiral.

In this case, each ring has substituents at 2 and 6, which are para. So each ring is symmetric in itself, but when connected, the overall molecule's symmetry depends on their arrangement.

If the substituents on each ring are positioned such that their arrangement around the central bond is not a mirror image, the molecule could be chiral.

But without knowing the specific arrangement, it's hard to say. However, the question is about whether the compound can show optical isomerism, which depends on whether it has a chiral center or axial chirality.

In the given case, the molecule may have axial chirality, making it chiral. Therefore, it can exhibit optical isomerism.

So, option 1 may have axial chirality and thus exhibit optical isomerism.

Previously, I thought option 2 has a chiral center and thus has optical isomerism. So, both options 1 and 2 would have optical isomerism.

Looking back at the options, option A includes 1, 2, and 4. But according to my analysis, only 1 and 2 have optical isomerism, and 4 doesn't. So option A is incorrect. Option D is 1 and 2, which matches my current understanding.

Wait, but let me double-check. Does option 1 have axial chirality? If the substituents on each ring are arranged in a way that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, then yes. So, if the substituents are on the same side of each ring relative to the central bond, the molecule may have a plane of symmetry and be achiral. But if the substituents are on opposite sides, then it's chiral.

But without knowing the exact configuration, the question is whether the compound can exhibit optical isomerism. So, if the substituents are arranged in a way that the molecule is chiral, then it can.

In this case, the substituents (nitro and carboxylate) are on the same ring in para positions. So, for each ring, they're opposite each other. But when connected to another ring, their arrangement relative to the central bond determines chirality.

If the substituents on each ring are in the same relative position (e.g., nitro group on the same side of the central bond on both rings), then the molecule could be symmetrical. But if they're on opposite sides, the molecule is asymmetrical and chiral.

In that case, the molecule can exhibit optical isomerism because it can have enantiomers.

So, in conclusion, option 1 and 2 exhibit optical isomerism. So the correct answer would be option D: 1 and 2.

Wait, but earlier I thought option 4 doesn't exhibit optical isomerism. So:

1. has axial chirality, so yes.
2. has chiral center, so yes.
3. no.
4. no.

So the correct answer would be option D: 1 and 2.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine which compounds exhibit optical isomerism, we analyze each option for the presence of chirality, which arises when a molecule has a non-superimposable mirror image due to a chiral center or axial chirality.

### Option 1: Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate  
This compound consists of two benzene rings connected by a single bond, with nitro groups at the 6 positions and carboxylate ester groups at the 2 positions on each ring. The biphenyl system can exhibit axial chirality if the substituents on the two rings are arranged asymmetrically relative to the central bond. Since the substituents (nitro and carboxylate) are in para positions on each ring, their arrangement around the central bond can lack a plane of symmetry, making the molecule chiral. Therefore, this compound can exhibit optical isomerism.

### Option 2: Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate  
The structure of this compound is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The second carbon in the chain is a chiral center, as it is bonded to four different groups: CH₃, OH, COOCH₃, and H. The presence of a chiral center means this compound can exist as two non-superimposable mirror images, making it capable of exhibiting optical isomerism.

### Option 3: Benzophenone  
Benzophenone has the structure Ph-C(=O)-Ph, where two phenyl groups are attached to a carbonyl carbon. The carbonyl carbon is double-bonded to oxygen and has two identical phenyl groups attached. This makes the molecule symmetric, as it has a plane of symmetry through the carbonyl carbon. Therefore, benzophenone is achiral and does not exhibit optical isomerism.

### Option 4: Dimethyl Fumarate  
The structure of dimethyl fumarate is CH₂(COOCH₃)-CH=CH-CH₂(COOCH₃) in the trans (E) configuration. Each carbon in the double bond is bonded to two identical groups (COOCH₃), making the molecule symmetric. Additionally, the double bond geometry (E or Z) does not contribute to chirality. Thus, dimethyl fumarate is achiral and does not exhibit optical isomerism.

### Conclusion  
- **Option 1** exhibits optical isomerism due to axial chirality.  
- **Option 2** exhibits optical isomerism due to the presence of a chiral center.  
- **Option 3** and **Option 4** do not exhibit optical isomerism as they are achiral.  

The correct answer is **D) 1 and 2**.
