Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about the kinetic energy of particles after a pion decays. Let me see what I remember from my studies. 

The reaction given is Pi(+) at rest decaying into a muon(+) and a neutrino. So, the equation is Pi+ → mu+ + nu. The pion is initially stationary, so its momentum is zero. I need to find the kinetic energies of the product particles, the muon and the neutrino.

Wait, wait. I remember that in particle decays, energy and momentum have to be conserved. Since the pion is at rest, the initial momentum is zero. So, the total momentum of the products must also be zero. That means the momenta of the muon and the neutrino must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.

Hmm, but neutrinos are tricky because they are neutral and have very little mass. Oh wait, in reality, neutrinos do have mass, but I think for many problems, especially in particle physics, they are considered to be massless. Or does that matter here? Let me think.

The given masses are the rest masses of the pion and the muon. The pion's rest mass is 139.6 MeV/c², and the muon's is 105.7 MeV/c². The neutrino's rest mass is negligible, I think. So I can approximate its mass as zero for this problem. That would make the neutrino a massless particle, which makes things a bit easier.

So, the pion is at rest, so its total energy is just its rest energy, which is 139.6 MeV. When it decays, the energy is shared between the muon and the neutrino. But because the pion is at rest, the total momentum of the products must be zero. So, the muon and neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta.

Let me denote the muon's momentum as p, and the neutrino's as P. So, p + P = 0 → P = -p. Since the neutrino is massless, its energy is just |P|c. The muon has both kinetic and rest energy. So, its total energy is sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c²)^2 ). 

Wait, but I'm working in units where c=1, so let's ignore it for simplicity. So, E_mu = sqrt( p^2 + m_mu^2 ), and E_nu = |p|, since for a massless particle, E = |p|.

The total energy from the decay is E_pi = E_mu + E_nu. Since the pion is at rest, E_pi = m_pi c² = 139.6 MeV.

So, putting it together:

E_mu + E_nu = m_pi → sqrt(p² + m_mu²) + p = m_pi.

Hmm, this looks like an equation I can solve for p.

Let me write it as sqrt(p² + m_mu²) = m_pi - p.

Now, square both sides to eliminate the square root:

p² + m_mu² = (m_pi - p)^2.

Expanding the right side:

= m_pi² - 2 m_pi p + p².

Now, subtract p² from both sides:

m_mu² = m_pi² - 2 m_pi p.

Rearranging:

2 m_pi p = m_pi² - m_mu².

So,

p = [ m_pi² - m_mu² ] / (2 m_pi )

Let me plug in the numbers.

m_pi =139.6 MeV, m_mu=105.7 MeV.

m_pi squared is (139.6)^2 ≈ let's calculate:

139.6 * 139.6: 140^2 is 19600, but since it's 0.4 less, 140*(140-0.8) = 140*139.2 = 140*(140) - 140*0.8 = 19600 - 112 = 19488. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, (a-b)^2 = a² - 2ab + b². So 139.6^2 = (140 - 0.4)^2 = 140² - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4² = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19600 -112 is 19488, plus 0.16 is 19488.16.

Similarly, m_mu squared is 105.7^2. Let's compute that:

100^2 is 10000, 5.7^2 is about 32.49, and the cross term is 2*100*5.7=1140. So 105.7^2 = (100+5.7)^2 = 10000 + 1140 + 32.49 = 11172.49.

So,

m_pi^2 - m_mu^2 = 19488.16 - 11172.49 = 8315.67 MeV^2.

Then, 2 m_pi = 2 * 139.6 = 279.2 MeV.

So, p = 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ let me compute that.

Divide numerator and denominator by 1000: 8.31567 / 0.2792 ≈ let's see, 8.31567 / 0.2792.

Wait, 0.2792 * 29.8 ≈ 8.28 (because 0.28 * 30 is 8.4, so 0.2792 *29.8 is about 8.28). Wait, let me compute 8.31567 / 0.2792.

Alternatively, 8315.67 / 279.2 = ?

Let me compute 279.2 * 29.8 = ?

279.2 *30 is 8376. So 279.2 * 29.8 = 279.2*(30-0.2) = 8376 - (279.2 *0.2)= 8376 -55.84= 8320.16. Hmm, our numerator is 8315.67 which is a bit less than 8320.16. So 29.8 would give 8320.16, which is 4.49 higher than 8315.67. So 29.8 - (4.49/279.2) ≈ 29.8 - (0.016) = about 29.784. So p ≈29.784 MeV/c.

Wait, but wait, I'm working in units where c is 1, so the units are MeV/c for momentum.

Wait, let me recount. The calculation gives p = (139.6^2 - 105.7^2)/(2*139.6) = (19488.16 - 11172.49)/(279.2) = 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ 29.784 MeV/c.

So, the neutrino's momentum is p =29.784 MeV/c, and the muon's momentum is also p, but in the opposite direction, so their momenta cancel each other.

Now, the energy of the neutrino is E_nu = |p| =29.784 MeV.

The muon's energy E_mu is sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2) = sqrt( (29.784)^2 + (105.7)^2 )

Let me compute 29.784 squared: approx (30)^2 is 900, but 29.784 is 30 minus 0.216. So (30 -0.216)^2 = 900 - 2*30*0.216 + 0.216² ≈900 -12.96 +0.046656 ≈887.086656.

105.7 squared is 11172.49 as before.

So, 887.086656 +11172.49 =12059.576656.

The square root of 12059.576656 is approximately sqrt(12059.58). Let me think: 110^2=12100, which is just a bit higher. So sqrt(12059.58) ≈109.814 MeV.

So, E_mu ≈109.814 MeV, and E_nu≈29.784 MeV.

Wait, but the total energy should be E_mu + E_nu = 109.814 +29.784 =139.598 ≈139.6 MeV, which matches the pion's rest energy. So that looks correct.

Now, the kinetic energy is the total energy minus the rest energy. So for the muon, KE_mu = E_mu - m_mu c². Since the units are in MeV, and we're using c=1, KE_mu = 109.814 -105.7 =4.114 MeV. Approximately 4.11 MeV.

The neutrino's KE is the same as its total energy because its rest mass is zero. So KE_nu = E_nu =29.784 MeV.

Wait, but wait, neutrinos are nearly massless, but do they have any kinetic energy? Oh, in this approximation, the neutrino's entire energy is kinetic because its rest mass is zero. So yes, the KE of the neutrino is 29.784 MeV.

So, the muon's KE is about 4.11 MeV, and the neutrino's KE is about 29.78 MeV.

Looking at the options:

Option D: 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV.

That's very close to our calculated values. So the answer should be option D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the kinetic energies of the muon and neutrino after the decay of a stationary pion, we use conservation of energy and momentum. The reaction is:

\[
\pi^+ \rightarrow \mu^+ + \nu
\]

### Key Information:
- Rest mass of the pion: \( m_{\pi} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \)
- Rest mass of the muon: \( m_{\mu} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \)
- The neutrino is assumed massless (\( m_{\nu} \approx 0 \)).

### Conservation of Energy:
The total energy of the system before decay is the rest energy of the pion:
\[
E_{\pi} = m_{\pi} c^2 = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}.
\]
After the decay, the total energy is shared between the muon and the neutrino:
\[
E_{\pi} = E_{\mu} + E_{\nu}.
\]

### Conservation of Momentum:
Since the pion is stationary, the total momentum before decay is zero. After the decay, the momenta of the muon and neutrino must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction:
\[
\vec{p}_{\mu} + \vec{p}_{\nu} = 0 \implies p_{\mu} = p_{\nu}.
\]

### Neutrino Energy:
For a massless neutrino, its energy is equal to its momentum:
\[
E_{\nu} = p_{\nu}.
\]

### Muon Energy:
The total energy of the muon is the sum of its rest energy and kinetic energy:
\[
E_{\mu} = \sqrt{p_{\mu}^2 + m_{\mu}^2}.
\]

### Solving for Momentum:
From conservation of energy:
\[
E_{\mu} + E_{\nu} = m_{\pi}.
\]
Substituting \( E_{\mu} = \sqrt{p_{\mu}^2 + m_{\mu}^2} \) and \( E_{\nu} = p_{\mu} \):
\[
\sqrt{p_{\mu}^2 + m_{\mu}^2} + p_{\mu} = m_{\pi}.
\]
Rearranging and squaring both sides:
\[
\sqrt{p_{\mu}^2 + m_{\mu}^2} = m_{\pi} - p_{\mu},
\]
\[
p_{\mu}^2 + m_{\mu}^2 = (m_{\pi} - p_{\mu})^2.
\]
Expanding and simplifying:
\[
p_{\mu}^2 + m_{\mu}^2 = m_{\pi}^2 - 2 m_{\pi} p_{\mu} + p_{\mu}^2,
\]
\[
m_{\mu}^2 = m_{\pi}^2 - 2 m_{\pi} p_{\mu}.
\]
Solving for \( p_{\mu} \):
\[
2 m_{\pi} p_{\mu} = m_{\pi}^2 - m_{\mu}^2,
\]
\[
p_{\mu} = \frac{m_{\pi}^2 - m_{\mu}^2}{2 m_{\pi}}.
\]

### Substituting Values:
- \( m_{\pi} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \),
- \( m_{\mu} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \).

First, calculate \( m_{\pi}^2 \) and \( m_{\mu}^2 \):
\[
m_{\pi}^2 = (139.6)^2 = 19488.16 \, \text{MeV}^2/c^4,
\]
\[
m_{\mu}^2 = (105.7)^2 = 11172.49 \, \text{MeV}^2/c^4.
\]
Then:
\[
p_{\mu} = \frac{19488.16 - 11172.49}{2 \times 139.6} = \frac{8315.67}{279.2} \approx 29.784 \, \text{MeV}/c.
\]

### Neutrino Energy:
\[
E_{\nu} = p_{\mu} = 29.784 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Muon Energy:
\[
E_{\mu} = \sqrt{p_{\mu}^2 + m_{\mu}^2}.
\]
Substitute \( p_{\mu}^2 = (29.784)^2 \approx 887.09 \, \text{MeV}^2/c^4 \) and \( m_{\mu}^2 = 11172.49 \, \text{MeV}^2/c^4 \):
\[
E_{\mu} = \sqrt{887.09 + 11172.49} = \sqrt{12059.58} \approx 109.814 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Kinetic Energies:
- Muon kinetic energy:
\[
KE_{\mu} = E_{\mu} - m_{\mu} = 109.814 - 105.7 = 4.114 \, \text{MeV}.
\]
- Neutrino kinetic energy:
\[
KE_{\nu} = E_{\nu} = 29.784 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The kinetic energies of the muon and neutrino are approximately \( 4.11 \, \text{MeV} \) and \( 29.8 \, \text{MeV} \), respectively. Comparing with the options, the closest match is:

**D) 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV.**
