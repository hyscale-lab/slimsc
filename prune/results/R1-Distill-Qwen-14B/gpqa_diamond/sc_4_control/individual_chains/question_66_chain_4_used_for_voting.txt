Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory, also known as SMEFT. Hmm, I need to figure out which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. Let me think through this.

The question gives me four options: Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry. The options are combinations of these, labeled A to D. I need to determine which combination is correct.

First, I remember that SMEFT is a framework that generalizes the Standard Model by including higher-dimensional operators. These operators are organized by their dimension and the symmetries they respect. But wait, what symmetries must all operators obey?

I think about Lorentz symmetry. SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory, right? So all operators must respect Lorentz symmetry. That would mean Lorentz symmetry is definitely one of the required symmetries. So option 1 is correct.

Next, Poincare symmetry. Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations (like in space and time). Since SMEFT is a field theory, it must respect Poincare symmetry. Wait, but isn't that automatically included when we have a Lorentz-invariant theory formulated in a Poincare-invariant spacetime? So if the theory respects Lorentz, it should also respect Poincare. But wait, the SMEFT operators are constructed in a way that respects Poincare symmetry. So I think all operators must respect Poincare symmetry as well. So option 2 is also correct.

Now, CP symmetry. I'm a bit fuzzy on this. I remember that CP symmetry is the combination of charge conjugation (C) and parity (P). But does SMEFT require all operators to be CP-symmetric? I think that's not necessarily the case. SMEFT allows for operators that break CP symmetry, especially because the Standard Model itself doesn't have a CP symmetry (except for some sectors, but generally, the SM doesn't enforce CP conservation everywhere). So operators in SMEFT can violate CP. Therefore, CP symmetry doesn't have to be respected by all operators. So option 3 is incorrect.

What about CPT symmetry? I recall that in quantum field theory, CPT is a fundamental symmetry. Noether's theorem and the structure of QFT require that CPT symmetry holds. So operators in any QFT must respect CPT symmetry. So option 4 is correct.

Putting it together: Symmetries 1 (Lorentz), 2 (Poincare), and 4 (CPT) must be respected. Wait, but wait. Is Poincare symmetry automatically included if Lorentz is? Because Poincare includes Lorentz and translations. But I think SMEFT operators are constructed in a way that they respect Poincare, not just Lorentz. So both 1 and 2 are correct.

Wait, but earlier I thought that all operators must respect Poincare symmetry. So the answer would include 1,2,4. Looking at the options, option C is 1,2,4. So that's option C.

Wait another thing: Does SMEFT allow for CPT violation? No, because CPT is a fundamental symmetry in quantum field theory. So any operator in the SMEFT must respect CPT. So yes, 4 is correct.

So the correct options are 1,2,4. Which corresponds to option C.

To determine which symmetries must be respected by all operators in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT), we analyze the given options:

1. **Lorentz Symmetry**: SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory, meaning all operators must respect Lorentz symmetry. This is a fundamental requirement for the framework.

2. **Poincaré Symmetry**: Poincaré symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry and translations in spacetime. Since SMEFT is formulated as a field theory in a Poincaré-invariant spacetime, all operators must also respect Poincaré symmetry.

3. **CP Symmetry**: CP symmetry combines charge conjugation (C) and parity (P). However, SMEFT does not require all operators to respect CP symmetry. The Standard Model itself does not enforce CP conservation everywhere, and SMEFT allows for operators that violate CP. Thus, CP symmetry is not a necessary symmetry for all operators in SMEFT.

4. **CPT Symmetry**: CPT symmetry is a fundamental symmetry in quantum field theory, and SMEFT, being a QFT framework, respects CPT symmetry. Therefore, all operators in SMEFT must respect CPT symmetry.

From this analysis, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincaré symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4). The correct combination is provided by option **C**.
