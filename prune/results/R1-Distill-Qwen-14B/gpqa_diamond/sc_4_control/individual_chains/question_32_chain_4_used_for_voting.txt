Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). The question is asking for the energy of the collider such that the speed of nucleus X is 0.96c. Hmm, right. 

Let me start by understanding what the problem is. So, nucleus X is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, lithium has different isotopes. Li usually has 3 protons, right? So if it has 3 neutrons, that would make it Li-6. Because 3 protons +3 neutrons is 6 nucleons. So the mass number A is 6. So the nucleus is Li-6.

I remember that in particle physics, when dealing with energies and speeds, we often use the relativistic equations because the speeds are a significant fraction of the speed of light. Since the speed here is 0.96c, which is pretty high, definitely relativistic effects are important.

The problem is asking for the energy of the collider. I think the energy in this context refers to the kinetic energy each nucleus has when moving at that speed. Or wait, maybe it's the total energy? I'm a bit confused. Let me think.

Wait, when they say the energy of the collider, I think they're referring to the total energy each ion has. Because in colliders, particles are accelerated to high speeds and collide head-on. So each ion's energy is important. 

So, the formula for the total energy (gamma * m c²) is probably needed here. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which depends on the velocity. Since the speed is given, I can calculate gamma first.

Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)).

Plugging in v = 0.96c:

v² = (0.96c)^2 = 0.9216 c².

So, 1 - v²/c² = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28, because 0.28^2 is 0.0784. So gamma is 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.5714.

Wait, let me calculate that more accurately. 0.28 squared is 0.0784, yes. So sqrt(0.0784) is exactly 0.28? Let me check: 0.28 * 0.28 is 0.0784, yes. So gamma is 1 / 0.28. What is 1 divided by 0.28?

0.28 is 28/100, so 1/(28/100) is 100/28. Let me compute that: 100 divided by 28. 28*3=84, 28*3.5714 is 100? Let me see: 28 * 3 = 84, 28*0.5714 is about 16, so 84+16=100. So 3.5714, exactly 3.57142857... So gamma is approximately 3.5714.

Now, the total energy is gamma multiplied by the rest mass energy of the nucleus. The rest mass energy is m c squared. So I need to find the mass of the Li-6 nucleus.

What's the mass of Li-6? The atomic mass unit (u) is known, and the mass can be calculated from the sum of the protons, neutrons, and binding energy. Alternatively, maybe I can look it up or use an approximate value.

Wait, but for the sake of calculation, perhaps it's easier to use the molar mass. The molar mass of Li-6 is about 6 grams per mole (since it's Li-6, each mole is 6 g). Wait, no, Li has an atomic weight of around 6.941 g/mol, but Li-6 is a lighter isotope. Hmm, maybe I should approach it differently.

Alternatively, the mass of the Li-6 nucleus can be found using the mass of the constituent nucleons. Each proton is about 1.007276 u, each neutron is about 1.008665 u. So for Li-6, which has 3 protons and 3 neutrons, the mass is 3*(1.007276) + 3*(1.008665) u.

Let me compute that:

3*(1.007276) = 3.021828 u.

3*(1.008665) = 3.025995 u.

Adding them together: 3.021828 + 3.025995 = 6.047823 u.

But wait, the actual mass of a nucleus is less than the sum of the masses of individual protons and neutrons due to binding energy. But wait, wait, no—that's the mass defect. So the actual mass is less than the sum. Wait, no, wait: when you combine nucleons, you release energy (mass defect). But wait, when considering the rest mass of the nucleus, it's the sum of the masses minus the binding energy (E=mc²). So the rest mass of the nucleus is (sum of individual masses) minus (binding energy / c²). So, for the purpose of calculating the rest mass energy, I think I need to use the exact mass of the Li-6 nucleus.

But I don't have the exact value on hand. Maybe I can approximate it. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to consider that the rest mass is approximately 6 u, but that's probably not precise enough.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I can use the relativistic energy equation and express the energy in terms of the rest mass. But I think I'll need the actual mass of Li-6.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the mass using the periodic table. Let me think: the atomic mass of Li is about 6.941 g/mol. But that's the atomic mass, including electrons. For the nucleus, I need to subtract the mass of the electrons.

Wait, each Li atom has 3 electrons. So, for Li-6, the atomic mass is about 6.941 u (since 1 mole is 6.941 grams, so per atom it's 6.941 / (Avogadro's number) ≈ 6.941 u per atom, but that's for the entire atom including electrons).

Wait, no, atomic mass is given per mole as 6.941 grams, so per atom, it's 6.941 / (6.022e23) ≈ 6.941e-23 grams per atom. But converting grams to u: 1 u is about 1.6605e-24 grams. So 6.941 grams per mole is 6.941 / (1.6605e-24 * 6.022e23) ) ? Wait, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of atomic mass units directly.

Alternatively, I can find the mass of the Li-6 nucleus as follows:

The atomic mass of Li-6 is approximately 6.015 u (I think I remember that from earlier studies). Let me confirm: checking a periodic table, the standard atomic weight of Li is about 6.941, but the specific isotopes have their own masses. For example, Li-6 has a mass of about 6.015 u, and Li-7 is about 7.016 u.

Yes, I think Li-6 has a mass of approximately 6.0150 u. So let's use that.

So, the rest mass energy is m c squared, where m is 6.0150 u. But I need to convert this into GeV.

I know that 1 u is approximately 931.5 MeV/c². So 1 u = 0.9315 GeV/c².

So, the rest mass energy is 6.0150 u * 0.9315 GeV/u.

Calculating that: 6 * 0.9315 = 5.589 GeV. 0.0150 * 0.9315 ≈ 0.0139725 GeV. So total is approximately 5.60297 GeV.

Wait let me calculate it more precisely.

6.0150 u * 931.5 MeV/u = ?

931.5 MeV is 0.9315 GeV. So 6.0150 * 0.9315 = ?

Let me compute 6 * 0.9315 = 5.589.

0.0150 * 0.9315 = 0.0139725.

Total: 5.589 + 0.0139725 = 5.6029725 GeV. So approximately 5.603 GeV.

So the rest energy is about 5.603 GeV.

Then, the total energy is gamma times that. Gamma is approximately 3.5714.

So, 3.5714 * 5.603 GeV ≈ ?

Let me compute 3.5714 *5.603.

First, 3 *5.603 = 16.809.

0.5714 *5.603 ≈ let's see:

0.5 *5.603 = 2.8015.

0.0714 *5.603 ≈ approximately 0.4015 (since 5.603 * 0.07 is 0.39221, and 0.0014 *5.603 is about 0.00784, so total ≈ 0.39221+0.00784=0.40005).

So 0.5714 *5.603 ≈ 2.8015 + 0.40005 = 3.20155.

So total is 16.809 +3.20155 = 20.01055 GeV.

Wait, but wait, I think I made a mistake here. Because 3.5714 is approximately 25/7 (since 3.5714 is 25/7 ≈3.57142857). So perhaps I can compute 25/7 *5.603.

25/7=3.57142857.

So 5.603 *25 = 140.075.

Then divide by 7: 140.075 /7 = 20.010714 GeV.

So approximately 20.0107 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is a bit higher. Option B is 23.069, which is higher. Option D is 21.419. Hmm, wait, why is there a discrepancy?

Wait, did I calculate the rest mass correctly?

Wait, perhaps I should be more precise with the mass of Li-6. Let me check again. The exact mass of the Li-6 nucleus is about 6.0150 u. So 6.0150 * 931.5 MeV/u.

Wait, 6.0150 * 931.5 = ?

Let me compute 6 * 931.5 = 5589 MeV.

0.015 *931.5 = 13.9725 MeV.

So total 5589 +13.9725 =5602.9725 MeV =5.6029725 GeV.

So that's correct. So that part is right.

Then, gamma is 3.57142857.

So 3.57142857 * 5.6029725 GeV.

Let me compute this more accurately.

Compute 3 *5.6029725 =16.8089175.

0.57142857 *5.6029725.

Wait, 0.5 *5.6029725 =2.80148625.

0.07142857 *5.6029725.

Hmm, 0.07 *5.6029725 =0.392208075.

0.00142857 *5.6029725 ≈ approx 0.007998.

So adding them, 0.392208075 + 0.007998 ≈ 0.400206.

So total for 0.57142857 *5.6029725 is 2.80148625 + 0.400206 ≈3.201692.

So total energy is 16.8089175 +3.201692 ≈20.0106095 GeV.

So approximately 20.0106 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is a bit higher. Option D is 21.419, which is over 20. So perhaps my calculation is missing something.

Wait another thought: the problem states the energy of the collider so that the speed of the nucleus is 0.96c. Are we considering the total energy, or just the kinetic energy?

Wait, because sometimes, when people refer to the energy of a particle accelerator, they might be referring to the kinetic energy (KE) rather than the total energy (which includes rest mass energy). Oh! That could be where I went wrong.

So, if the question is asking for the kinetic energy, then I need to calculate KE = (gamma -1) m c².

Let me recalculate that.

Gamma is 3.57142857.

So KE = (3.57142857 -1) *5.6029725 GeV.

3.57142857 -1 =2.57142857.

So KE=2.57142857 *5.6029725.

Compute that:

2 *5.6029725 =11.205945.

0.57142857 *5.6029725 ≈3.201692 (as before).

So total KE≈11.205945 +3.201692=14.407637 GeV.

Wait, but that's about 14.4 GeV, which doesn't match any of the options. Hmm.

Wait, but the options are all around 18-23 GeV, except option A is 18.475. So if the calculation for total energy is about 20 GeV, but none of the options match exactly, perhaps the problem wants the total energy, not the kinetic.

So back to the initial calculation: total energy is about 20.01 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is a little higher.

Hmm, maybe my approximation for gamma is a bit rough. Let me calculate gamma more accurately.

v=0.96c.

v^2= (0.96)^2 c^2=0.9216 c^2.

1 - v^2/c^2=1 -0.9216=0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784)=0.28 exactly, because 0.28 *0.28=0.0784.

Gamma=1/0.28=3.5714285714.

So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the mass of the nucleus.

Wait, the mass of Li-6 is 6.0150 u.

Wait, let me compute more accurately. 6.0150 u *931.5 MeV/u.

6.0150 *931.5 = ?

Let me compute 6 *931.5 =5589.

0.015 *931.5 =13.9725.

Total is 5602.9725 MeV=5.6029725 GeV.

So that's correct.

Wait, maybe the problem is about the rest energy of a single nucleon? No, because the nucleus is a collection of nucleons.

Alternatively, perhaps the speed is 0.96c, but the mass used is that of a single proton? No, the nucleus is Li-6, so the mass is as I calculated.

Wait, perhaps I should use the mass in kilograms. Let me try that approach.

Wait, but that might complicate calculations without a calculator. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the exact gamma value.

Wait, perhaps it's better to do the calculation with more precise values.

Let me compute gamma more precisely. Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2).

0.96^2 =0.9216.

1-0.9216=0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784)=0.28.

So gamma is 3.57142857.

But perhaps I can calculate it more accurately. Let me use more decimal places. Let me compute sqrt(0.0784) more precisely.

Wait, 0.28^2 is 0.0784 exactly, so sqrt(0.0784)=0.28 exactly. So gamma is exactly 1/0.28 =3.57142857...

So no issues there.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 3.57142857 *5.6029725 exactly.

3.57142857 = 25/7.

So 25/7 *5.6029725 = (25 *5.6029725)/7.

Compute 25 *5.6029725 =?

5.6029725 *25:

5 *25=125,

0.6029725 *25=15.0743125.

So total is 125 +15.0743125=140.0743125.

Now, divide by 7: 140.0743125 /7.

140 /7=20.

0.0743125 /7 = approximately 0.010616071.

So total is 20.010616 GeV.

So approximately 20.0106 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is about 0.12 GeV higher, which is about 120 MeV. Hmm, that's a significant difference. So where did I go wrong?

Wait, perhaps the mass of the Li-6 nucleus isn't exactly 6.0150 u. Maybe it's a bit different. Let me look up the exact mass.

After checking, the exact mass of the Li-6 nucleus is approximately 6.0150 u. So I think that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup. Let me think: The problem states "the energy of the RHIC so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c". So each nucleus is moving at 0.96c, and we need to find the energy per nucleus. So, I think the approach is correct.

Wait, but wait: the RHIC accelerates heavy ions, but sometimes the energy is given per nucleon. No, I think in this context, it's the total energy per ion.

Hmm. So according to my calculation, the energy is approximately 20.01 GeV, but the options don't have exactly that. The closest option is C)20.132 GeV. But that's about 0.12 GeV higher. So maybe my calculation missed something.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate using more precise values for gamma.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem uses the approximation where the total energy is calculated using non-relativistic formulas, but that's unlikely because 0.96c is highly relativistic.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the energy per nucleon. Wait, the nucleus has 6 nucleons (3 protons, 3 neutrons). So if the total energy is 20 GeV, then per nucleon it's about 3.3 GeV. But the options don't seem to suggest that.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is giving the kinetic energy, not the total energy. So let me compute the kinetic energy.

Kinetic energy (KE) = (gamma -1) * m c².

Gamma is 3.57142857.

So gamma minus 1 is 2.57142857.

Multiply by 5.6029725 GeV:

2.57142857 *5.6029725.

Let me compute this.

2.57142857 *5.6029725.

Compute 2 *5.6029725=11.205945.

0.57142857 *5.6029725=?

0.5 *5.6029725=2.80148625.

0.07142857 *5.6029725=0.400206.

So total for 0.57142857 *5.6029725 is 2.80148625 + 0.400206 =3.201692.

So KE=11.205945 +3.201692=14.407637 GeV.

So about 14.4076 GeV. But none of the options match this. The options are higher.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is that I'm using the wrong mass for the nucleus. Let me think again. Wait, the problem states that X is Li with 3 neutrons. So Li has 3 protons, so 3+3=6 nucleons, making it Li-6. So the mass I used was correct.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the problem is relativistic, but using the rest mass in the lab frame. Or perhaps the kinetic energy per nucleon is what's being considered, but I don't think that's the case.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the exact value with more precise numbers.

Let me try recalculating the gamma factor precisely.

v =0.96c.

v² = (0.96)^2 c² = 0.9216 c².

1 - v²/c²=0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784)=0.28.

So gamma=1/0.28=3.5714285714.

So, that's correct.

Rest mass energy: 6.0150 u *931.5 MeV/u =6.0150 *931.5 MeV.

6 *931.5=5589, 0.015*931.5=13.9725. So 5589 +13.9725 =5602.9725 MeV=5.6029725 GeV.

So, total energy = gamma * rest energy =3.57142857 *5.6029725.

Compute this:

3.57142857 *5.6029725.

Let me compute this as (3 + 0.57142857) *5.6029725.

3 *5.6029725=16.8089175.

0.57142857 *5.6029725.

0.5 *5.6029725=2.80148625.

0.07142857 *5.6029725.

Calculate 5.6029725 *0.07 =0.392208075.

5.6029725 *0.00142857 ≈0.007998.

So total of 0.392208075 +0.007998=0.400206075.

So 0.57142857 *5.6029725=2.80148625 +0.400206075=3.201692325.

So total energy=16.8089175 +3.201692325=20.010609825 GeV.

Approximately 20.0106 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is close but not exact. But maybe my initial assumption about the rest mass is slightly off. Perhaps the actual mass of Li-6 is a little higher, which would make the energy a bit higher.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that in the RHIC, the energy is given in terms of the total energy per nucleon. But for the nucleus, the total energy is the sum for all nucleons? No, that doesn't make sense. Each nucleon's energy would be part of the nucleus's total energy.

Wait, maybe I should compute the energy using the exact value of 1u = 931.494 MeV/c² instead of 931.5. Let me try that.

So, 1u =931.494 MeV/c².

So, 6.0150 u *931.494 MeV/u = ?

6.0150 *931.494.

Compute that.

6 *931.494=5588.964.

0.015 *931.494=13.97241.

Total:5588.964 +13.97241=5602.93641 MeV=5.60293641 GeV.

So, the rest mass energy is approximately 5.60293641 GeV.

Gamma is still 3.57142857.

So, total energy=3.57142857 *5.60293641.

Let me compute this.

3.57142857 *5.60293641.

Again, break it into 3 +0.57142857.

3 *5.60293641=16.80880923.

0.57142857 *5.60293641.

Compute 0.5 *5.60293641=2.801468205.

0.07142857 *5.60293641.

0.07 *5.60293641=0.3922055487.

0.00142857 *5.60293641≈0.007998026.

So total for 0.07142857 is 0.3922055487 +0.007998026≈0.4002035747.

So 0.57142857 *5.60293641=2.801468205 +0.4002035747=3.2016717797.

Total energy=16.80880923 +3.2016717797=20.01048101 GeV.

So approximately 20.0105 GeV.

Still around 20.01 GeV. So none of the options except C are close.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation. Wait, option B is 23.069 GeV, which is way higher. Option D is 21.419, which is ~1.4 GeV higher than my calculation. So maybe the correct approach is to include the charge or something else?

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the total energy in the lab frame, but perhaps the collider is a fixed target setup. No, RHIC is a collider, so particles are moving in opposite directions.

Alternatively, maybe I'm missing a factor. Wait, the speed is 0.96c, so perhaps the beta is 0.96, so beta = v/c=0.96.

Gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - beta²) = 1/sqrt(1 -0.96²) = 1/sqrt(0.0784)=1/0.28=3.5714.

So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a different value for the speed. Wait, the question says 0.96c. Did I read that correctly? Yes.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the energy per nucleon, not per nucleus.

Wait, the nucleus has 6 nucleons. So if the total energy is 20 GeV, per nucleon it's 20 /6 ≈3.333 GeV. But that's not matching any options either.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to calculate the kinetic energy per nucleon. But that would be 14.4 GeV /6 ≈2.4 GeV per nucleon. Not matching any options.

Hmm. Now I'm a bit stuck. The calculation leads me to approximately 20 GeV, but the closest option is C)20.132 GeV. But maybe I made a mistake in the rest mass calculation.

Wait, perhaps the rest mass of the Li-6 nucleus is actually 6.0151 u. Let me see how that affects the calculation.

So, 6.0151 u *931.494 MeV/u=?

6.0151 *931.494=6*931.494=5588.964, 0.0151 *931.494= approx 14.008.

So total 5588.964 +14.008=5602.972 MeV=5.602972 GeV.

So the rest energy is 5.602972 GeV.

Gamma is 3.57142857.

So total energy=3.57142857 *5.602972.

Compute that again.

3*5.602972=16.808916.

0.57142857 *5.602972.

0.5 *5.602972=2.801486.

0.07142857 *5.602972: 0.07 *5.602972=0.392208, 0.00142857 *5.602972≈0.007998. So 0.392208+0.007998=0.400206.

So 0.57142857 *5.602972=2.801486 +0.400206=3.201692.

Total energy=16.808916 +3.201692=20.010608 GeV.

Still around 20.01 GeV. So perhaps the options have a typo or I'm missing another factor.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the relativistic momentum formula and getting a different gamma.

Wait, let's compute the momentum and see if that gives another approach.

Momentum p = gamma m v.

But since we're given v, perhaps that's not necessary.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the total relativistic energy as (gamma) times the rest mass, which is the same as what I did.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using 0.96c as the speed, but in the lab frame, the actual speed of the nucleus is different, but that's not the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the energy using more precise values of the constants.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the energy is given in terms of the center of mass energy. But no, the question is about each nucleus's energy.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the problem is using the rest mass of the proton, not the nucleus. But that doesn't make sense because the nucleus is Li-6.

Wait, but if I mistakenly used the proton mass, let's see what I would get.

Mass of proton is about 0.9383 GeV/c².

Gamma is 3.5714.

So total energy would be 3.5714 *0.9383 ≈3.354 GeV. That's way lower than the options, so that's not it.

So back to the original calculation, the result is approximately 20.01 GeV, but the options are C)20.132 and D)21.419.

Hmm. Wait, perhaps I should use a more precise value for gamma.

Wait, v=0.96c, beta=0.96.

Gamma=1/sqrt(1 - 0.96^2) =1/sqrt(0.0784)=1/0.28=3.57142857.

So no mistake there.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate using the exact value of the square root.

Wait, 1 -0.96^2=0.0784.

What's the exact square root of 0.0784?

0.28 is exact because 0.28^2=0.0784.

So gamma is exactly 3.57142857.

Hmm. So the calculation is correct, but the options don't match.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the answer to be in a different unit, but the options are all in GeV, so that's not it.

Alternatively, perhaps the speed is 0.96c in the lab frame, but the actual speed in the collider's frame is different. No, I think that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of nucleons. Wait, Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons, 6 nucleons total. So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the kinetic energy per nucleon, but again, that doesn't fit with the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the total energy of the ion beam, not the individual ions. But RHIC collides two beams, so the total energy would be the sum of both. But the question asks for the energy of the RHIC, which I think refers to the energy per ion.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the problem is using the relativistic equation for energy, but with a different approach.

Total energy E = gamma m c².

I have the correct gamma and m c².

So E=3.57142857 *5.602972 GeV ≈20.0106 GeV.

So, the closest option is C)20.132 GeV, but that's about 0.12 GeV higher.

Wait, perhaps I should use a more precise value for the atomic mass.

Wait, perhaps the exact mass of Li-6 is 6.01500 u, but perhaps it's actually 6.01503 u or similar. Let's see how it affects.

If the mass is 6.01503 u,

6.01503 *931.494 MeV=6.01503 *931.494.

Compute that:

6 *931.494 =5588.964.

0.01503 *931.494= 14.006.

So total is 5588.964 +14.006=5602.97 MeV=5.60297 GeV.

So E=3.57142857 *5.60297 GeV=?

3.57142857 *5.60297 =20.0106 GeV, same as before.

So that's not the issue.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the speed is given as 0.96c, but the calculation is done using (v=0.96c), but perhaps it's beta=0.96, which we did correctly.

Wait, perhaps the problem wants the energy in a different unit, but the options are all in GeV.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach. Maybe the problem is using the rest mass energy multiplied by gamma, but perhaps I should calculate the kinetic energy differently.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the total kinetic energy, not the total energy. Wait, but earlier calculation for KE was 14.4 GeV, which doesn't match any options.

So, perhaps the correct answer isn't one of the options, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial gamma calculation.

Wait, let me compute gamma again using more precise math.

v=0.96c.

beta=0.96.

So beta²=0.9216.

1 - beta²=0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784)=0.28.

So, gamma=1/0.28=3.57142857.

Wait, perhaps I should use a calculator for precise calculations, but I can't do that right now.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the rest mass of the deuteron or something else. No, the nucleus is Li-6.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the mass of the entire atom, not the nucleus. Oh! That's a possibility. Because I used the nucleus mass, but the problem states "nucleus X is Li with 3 neutrons", so it's the nucleus. So I think I'm correct.

Wait, but if I mistakenly used the atomic mass including electrons, what would happen?

The atomic mass of Li is about 6.941 g/mol. But for Li-6, the atomic mass is about 6.94 g/mol. So per mole, 6.94 grams. The molar mass is 6.94 g/mol, so per atom, it's 6.94 / Avogadro's number ≈6.94e-23 grams.

But converting to u: 1 u = 1.6605e-24 grams. So 6.94e-23 grams /1.6605e-24 grams/u ≈42 u. That can't be right, because that's way too high. So that approach is wrong.

So no, the initial approach is correct.

Hmm, perhaps I should look at the options again. Option D is 21.419 GeV. How far is that from 20 GeV? It's about 6.7% higher.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a different approach, like non-relativistic energy, but that doesn't make sense because 0.96c is relativistic.

Wait, non-relativistic kinetic energy is (1/2)mv².

But with v=0.96c, that's highly relativistic, so non-relativistic is not applicable. But just for fun, let's see:

m=6.0150 u=6.0150 *1.6605e-27 kg= approx 1.002e-26 kg.

v=0.96c=0.96 *3e8 m/s=2.88e8 m/s.

KE=0.5 *1.002e-26 kg * (2.88e8)^2.

(2.88e8)^2=8.2944e16.

0.5 *1.002e-26 *8.2944e16=0.5 *1.002e-26 *8.2944e16=0.5 *8.2944e-10=4.1472e-10 J.

Convert to GeV: 1 eV=1.602e-19 J. 1 GeV=1e9 eV=1.602e-10 J.

So 4.1472e-10 J / 1.602e-10 J/GeV ≈2.59 GeV. That's way lower than any option, so definitely not applicable.

So, I must have done something right, but the options don't match exactly. So perhaps the correct answer is option C)20.132 GeV, which is the closest.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses the exact value of the speed. Let me compute gamma using more precise v.

But with v=0.96c, it's exact.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the exact value of 1u =931.494 MeV/c², which I did, but perhaps miscalculating.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 25/7 * (6.0150 *931.5) MeV.

But 6.0150 *931.5=5602.9725 MeV.

25/7 *5602.9725 MeV = (25 *5602.9725)/7 MeV.

25 *5602.9725=140,074.3125 MeV.

Divide by 7: 140,074.3125 /7 =20,010.61607 GeV.

Wait, that's 20.0106 GeV, same as before.

Hmm. So I'm confident that the correct energy is approximately 20.01 GeV, but the options don't have that. Among the options, C is 20.132 GeV, which is the closest. But perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses 0.96c as the speed, but the mass is that of a single neutron. No, that's not right because the nucleus is Li-6.

I'm stuck. I think the correct answer based on my calculations is approximately 20.01 GeV, but the closest option is C)20.132 GeV.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) such that the speed of the Li-6 nucleus is 0.96c, we use relativistic energy equations. The nucleus in question is Li-6, which has a mass of approximately 6.0150 atomic mass units (u). The rest mass energy of the nucleus is calculated as:

\[
E_{\text{rest}} = m c^2 = 6.0150 \, \text{u} \times 931.5 \, \text{MeV/u} = 5.6029725 \, \text{GeV}.
\]

The Lorentz factor (\(\gamma\)) is determined from the relativistic relation:

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}.
\]

Given \(v = 0.96c\), we calculate:

\[
v^2 = (0.96c)^2 = 0.9216c^2, \quad 1 - v^2/c^2 = 0.0784, \quad \sqrt{0.0784} = 0.28, \quad \gamma = \frac{1}{0.28} \approx 3.5714.
\]

The total energy of the nucleus is then:

\[
E_{\text{total}} = \gamma E_{\text{rest}} = 3.5714 \times 5.6029725 \, \text{GeV}.
\]

Breaking this calculation into parts:

\[
3.5714 \times 5.6029725 = 3 \times 5.6029725 + 0.5714 \times 5.6029725,
\]

\[
3 \times 5.6029725 = 16.8089175, \quad 0.5714 \times 5.6029725 \approx 3.201692,
\]

\[
E_{\text{total}} \approx 16.8089175 + 3.201692 = 20.0106 \, \text{GeV}.
\]

This result is approximately 20.01 GeV. Among the provided options, the closest value is **C) 20.132 GeV**, which is slightly higher than the calculated value. The discrepancy may arise from minor differences in the assumed mass of the Li-6 nucleus or rounding conventions. Based on the calculations, the most reasonable answer is:

**Answer: C**
