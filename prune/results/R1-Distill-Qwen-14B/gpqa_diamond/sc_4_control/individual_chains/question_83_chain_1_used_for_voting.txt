Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about titration, and I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again to make sure I get the details right.

The problem says: We dilute 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate the resulting solution with 0.1 M NaOH. The question is asking for the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A to D, with various pH values.

I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base, so this is a typical acid-base titration scenario. Let's break it down into parts: first, the initial solution after dilution, then the titration process, and calculate the pH at the 25% point and the equivalence point.

First, let's figure out the initial concentrations after dilution. The initial solution is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we add 20 cm³ of water. So the total volume becomes 40 cm³, which is 0.04 liters.

The moles of acetic acid before dilution would be Molarity × Volume (in liters). So 0.05 M × 0.02 L = 0.001 moles. After dilution, the volume is 0.04 L, so the new concentration is moles / volume = 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Wait, is that right? Let me double-check. 0.05 is 5e-2, volume is 0.02 L, so 5e-2 * 0.02 = 1e-3 moles. Then 1e-3 divided by 0.04 L is 0.025 M. That seems correct.

So the diluted acetic acid concentration is 0.025 M. Now, during titration with NaOH, which is a strong base, the reaction will be CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COONa + H2O. Each mole of NaOH will neutralize a mole of acetic acid.

The equivalence point is when moles of NaOH added equal the moles of acetic acid. Let's calculate the initial moles of acetic acid in the diluted solution. Oh wait, I already did that: 0.001 moles. So the volume of NaOH needed to reach equivalence would be moles / concentration. Moles of NaOH needed is 0.001, and concentration is 0.1 M. So volume is 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. So the equivalence point is when 10 cm³ of NaOH is added.

The question asks about the pH at 25% titration and at equivalence. Let's handle each point one by one.

First, the 25% titration. Since the equivalence point is at 10 cm³, 25% of that is 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added. So how many moles of NaOH have been added? 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 moles.

So in the solution, initial moles of acetic acid are 0.001, and moles of NaOH added are 0.00025. The reaction consumes 0.00025 moles of acetic acid and produces 0.00025 moles of acetate ion (CH3COO^-).

So the moles of acetic acid left: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol.

Moles of acetate ion formed: 0.00025 mol.

The total volume at this point is the original 40 cm³ plus the 2.5 cm³ of NaOH, so 42.5 cm³ or 0.0425 L.

So the concentrations are:

[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M

[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M

Since this is a buffer solution (a weak acid and its conjugate base), we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA])

The pKa is given by the negative log of Ka. Ka is 1.85e-5. So pKa = log(1/(1.85e-5)) → wait, no, pKa is -log(Ka). So, pKa = -log(1.85e-5). Let me compute that. Log(1.85) is about 0.267, so log(1.85e-5) is 0.267 -5 = -4.733. So pKa is 4.733.

So plugging into the equation: pH = 4.733 + log(0.005882 / 0.017647)

Let's compute the ratio: 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.3333.

Log(0.3333) is about -0.477.

So pH ≈ 4.733 - 0.477 ≈ 4.256. Hmm, that’s approximately 4.26. Looking at the options, option A has 4.26 as the first pH value. But let me check other options too.

Wait, wait, let me recalculate the ratio.

Wait, moles of acetate is 0.00025, and acetic acid is 0.00075. So ratio is 0.25. So log(0.25) is log(1/4) = -log(4) ≈ -0.602. Oh wait, I made a mistake earlier. Wait, 0.005882 divided by 0.017647 is 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.3333, which is 1/3. So log(1/3) is approximately -0.477. So the pH would be 4.733 - 0.477 ≈ 4.256, which is about 4.26. So that's the pH at 25% titration.

Now, the equivalence point. At equivalence, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate ions. So the solution will be a solution of sodium acetate in water, which is a salt of a weak acid and strong base. So the solution will be basic because the acetate ion will hydrolyze in water.

So the concentration of acetate ion at equivalence can be calculated.

At equivalence, all the acetic acid (0.001 mol) is converted to acetate. The total volume is initial 40 cm³ + 10 cm³ of NaOH = 50 cm³ (0.05 L).

So concentration of CH3COO^- is 0.001 mol / 0.05 L = 0.02 M.

The acetate ion (A^-) will hydrolyze as follows: A^- + H2O ↔ HA + OH^-

The Kb for this reaction is Kw / Ka. Kw is 1e-14 at 25°C. So Kb = 1e-14 / (1.85e-5) ≈ 5.405e-10.

So the Kb is small, so the hydrolysis will be slight, and we can approximate using the assumption that [OH^-] is small compared to initial concentration.

Let me set up the expression. Let x be [OH^-] produced.

Kb = [HA][OH^-] / [A^-] ≈ (x)(x) / (0.02) = x² / 0.02

Set x² = Kb * 0.02 → x² = (5.405e-10)(0.02) = 1.081e-11

x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 3.288e-6 M.

So [OH^-] is 3.288e-6 M, pOH is -log(3.288e-6) ≈ 5.48

So pH = 14 - 5.48 ≈ 8.52.

Wait, but wait, wait. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the solution is 0.02 M in acetate. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of Kb or the setup.

Wait, another approach: The hydrolysis reaction is CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-. The Kb is Kw / Ka = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) = 5.405e-10. Correct.

So Kb = 5.405e-10. The initial concentration is 0.02 M. Let me write the expression:

Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-]. If x is [OH^-], then:

x²/(0.02 - x) ≈ x²/0.02 = Kb → x² = Kb * 0.02 → x² = (5.405e-10)(0.02) = 1.081e-11 → x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 3.288e-6.

So pOH is -log(3.288e-6). Let me compute that:

Log(3.288e-6) = log(3.288) + log(1e-6) → log(3.288) is about 0.5168, so total is 0.5168 -6 = -5.4832. So pOH is 5.4832, so pH is 14 -5.4832= 8.5168, which is approximately 8.52.

So the pH at equivalence is about 8.52.

Looking at the options: Option A is 4.26 and 8.52. That fits. Let me check other options.

Option D is 4.57 and 6.92. Hmm, that doesn't match. So perhaps the answer is A.

Wait, but wait another moment: I just realized that perhaps I made a mistake in the stoichiometry for the equivalence point.

Wait, the initial moles of acetic acid were 0.001 mol. The NaOH added is 10 cm³ of 0.1 M, which is 0.001 mol. So yes, all acetic acid is neutralized, producing 0.001 mol of acetate.

The total volume is 40 cm³ + 10 cm³ = 50 cm³ = 0.05 L. So the concentration is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M, correct.

Wait, but I just thought, when using the Kb expression, perhaps I should check if the assumption that x is small compared to 0.02 is valid. Let's see: x is 3.288e-6, which is 3.288e-6, and 0.02 is 2e-2. The ratio is about 1.64e-4, which is much less than 5%, so the assumption holds. So the calculation is valid.

So the pH at equivalence is approximately 8.52, and at 25% titration, it's about 4.26. So the correct option is A.

But wait, looking at the options again, option A says 4.26; 8.52, that's what I got. But let me think: perhaps I made a mistake in the initial concentration after dilution.

Wait, wait! Let me go back. The initial solution is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we add 20 cm³ of water. So total volume is 40 cm³.

Moles of acetic acid: 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 mol, correct. So diluted to 0.04 L (40 cm³), so 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M, correct.

Wait, but when we add 25% of the titration volume, which is 2.5 cm³, correct. So total volume is 42.5 cm³ (0.0425 L). So the concentrations are:

After adding 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH (0.00025 mol), the moles of acetic acid remaining are 0.00075 mol, and acetate is 0.00025 mol. So the ratio is (0.00025 / 0.00075) = 1/3. So the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation gives pH = pKa + log(1/3) → 4.733 + (-0.477) = 4.256, which is about 4.26. So that's correct.

So option A is correct. But wait, in the options, option D is 4.57 and 6.92. How could that be? Did I make a mistake elsewhere?

Wait, I think I remember that the pH at equivalence for a weak acid titrated with a strong base is determined by the hydrolysis of the conjugate base. So the calculation I did should be correct.

Alternatively, perhaps there's another way to calculate the 25% point, but I don't think so. Let me think again about the 25% titration.

Wait, 25% of the way to equivalence. The equivalence point requires 10 cm³ of NaOH. So 25% of that is 2.5 cm³. So the moles of NaOH added are 0.1 M × 0.0025 L = 0.00025 mol. So the moles of acetic acid neutralized are 0.00025, so remaining is 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075, and acetate is 0.00025.

So the Henderson-Hasselbalch gives pH = pKa + log (0.00025/0.00075) → log(1/3) = -0.477. So 4.733 - 0.477 = 4.256, which rounds to 4.26. So that part is correct.

So the two pH values are 4.26 and 8.52, which match option A.

But wait, looking at the options again, I don't see any other option with 8.52 except option A. So, the answer should be option A.

Wait, but I thought another approach for the equivalence point: perhaps I should compute the pH correctly by considering it's a buffer? No, no. At equivalence, all acetic acid is converted to acetate. So the solution is acetate in water, which hydrolyzes. So the calculation is correct.

Wait, but let me think about the Kb again. Let me compute it more accurately. Ka is 1.85e-5 → pKa is about 4.733. So Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 ≈ 5.405e-10. Correct.

So x² = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11 → x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 3.288e-6. So [OH^-] is 3.288e-6 → pOH is 5.48 → pH 8.52.

Yes, that's correct. So option A is the correct answer.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we first calculate the concentration of acetic acid after dilution. Initially, 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid contains:

\[
\text{Moles of acetic acid} = 0.05 \, \text{M} \times 0.02 \, \text{L} = 0.001 \, \text{mol}.
\]

After dilution with 20.00 cm³ of water, the total volume is:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 20.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 20.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.04 \, \text{L}.
\]

The new concentration of acetic acid is:

\[
\text{Concentration} = \frac{\text{Moles}}{\text{Volume}} = \frac{0.001}{0.04} = 0.025 \, \text{M}.
\]

### Titration at 25%
At 25% titration, 25% of the equivalence point volume is reached. The equivalence point requires:

\[
\text{Volume of NaOH} = \frac{\text{Moles of acetic acid}}{\text{Concentration of NaOH}} = \frac{0.001}{0.1} = 10.00 \, \text{cm}^3.
\]

Thus, 25% of this volume is:

\[
\text{Volume of NaOH added} = 0.25 \times 10.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 2.50 \, \text{cm}^3.
\]

The moles of NaOH added are:

\[
\text{Moles of NaOH} = 0.1 \, \text{M} \times 0.0025 \, \text{L} = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]

This reacts with an equal amount of acetic acid, leaving:

\[
\text{Moles of acetic acid remaining} = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The moles of acetate ion formed are:

\[
\text{Moles of acetate} = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The total volume at this point is:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 2.50 \, \text{cm}^3 = 42.50 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.0425 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentrations are:

\[
[\text{Acetic acid}] = \frac{0.00075}{0.0425} \approx 0.017647 \, \text{M},
\]
\[
[\text{Acetate}] = \frac{0.00025}{0.0425} \approx 0.005882 \, \text{M}.
\]

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{pKa} + \log \left( \frac{[\text{Acetate}]}{[\text{Acetic acid}]} \right),
\]

where:

\[
\text{pKa} = -\log(1.85 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.733.
\]

Substituting the ratio:

\[
\text{pH} = 4.733 + \log \left( \frac{0.005882}{0.017647} \right) = 4.733 + \log(0.333) \approx 4.733 - 0.477 = 4.256 \approx 4.26.
\]

### At the Equivalence Point
At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid (0.001 mol) is neutralized to acetate ions. The total volume is:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 10.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 50.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.05 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentration of acetate ions is:

\[
[\text{Acetate}] = \frac{0.001}{0.05} = 0.02 \, \text{M}.
\]

The acetate ion hydrolyzes in water:

\[
\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O} \leftrightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{OH}^-.
\]

The equilibrium constant for this reaction is:

\[
\text{K}_b = \frac{\text{K}_w}{\text{K}_a} = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.405 \times 10^{-10}.
\]

Let the concentration of \(\text{OH}^-\) at equilibrium be \(x\). Then:

\[
\text{K}_b = \frac{x^2}{[\text{Acetate}] - x}.
\]

Assuming \(x \ll 0.02\), we approximate:

\[
\text{K}_b \approx \frac{x^2}{0.02}.
\]

Solving for \(x\):

\[
x^2 = \text{K}_b \times 0.02 = (5.405 \times 10^{-10})(0.02) = 1.081 \times 10^{-11},
\]
\[
x = \sqrt{1.081 \times 10^{-11}} \approx 3.288 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{M}.
\]

The pOH is:

\[
\text{pOH} = -\log(3.288 \times 10^{-6}) \approx 5.48,
\]

and the pH is:

\[
\text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 5.48 = 8.52.
\]

### Final Answer
The pH at 25% titration is approximately **4.26**, and the pH at the equivalence point is approximately **8.52**. These values match **Option A**.

Answer: A
