Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but let's try to break it down step by step. Let's see what information I have.

The question is about a substance X reacting with liquid Y. The reaction releases gas W, which has a molecule with the same number of neutrons and protons. Then, a precipitate G forms, and when heated, it releases B. The melting point of B is close to 277 K, which I think is around 4 degrees Celsius because 273 K is 0°C. So B is probably something that melts just above freezing. Hmm, maybe water? Wait, but water's melting point is 273 K, so 277 K is a bit higher, maybe something else.

The product of X reacting with a certain keto acid has 2 oxygen atoms. Also, X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, and it's known for incorporating a heavier isotope of one of its elements. So I'm thinking maybe X is something like sodium borohydride or something else with isotopes.

Let's think about the reaction between X and Y. The reaction is violent, so maybe it's a strong acid-base reaction or something exothermic. The gas W has equal protons and neutrons. So the molecule would be something like H2O, NH3, or maybe CO? Wait, let's think about the atoms. Let's say the molecule is something like H2O. H has 1 proton and 0 neutrons (for H), but O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons (since oxygen-16 is the most common). Wait, but that doesn't fit equal numbers. Oh wait, maybe W is CO? No, CO has 29 protons in total (C has 6, O has 8), but the number of protons and neutrons in the molecule? Wait, maybe each molecule has the same number of protons and neutrons. So maybe for each molecule, protons = neutrons.

Wait, maybe W is something like CH4. No, CH4 has 5 protons (C has 6, but maybe I'm miscalculating). Maybe W is H2O: H has 1, O has 8. So each H2O molecule has 2*1 +8 = 10 protons. Number of neutrons would be 2*(0) (H is usually 1H, which has 0 neutrons) plus 8 (since O-16 has 8 neutrons). So total neutrons 8. But 10 protons and 8 neutrons don't match. Hmm, that's a problem.

Alternatively, maybe W is something else. Let's think of another molecule. Let's consider NH3. N has 7 protons, H has 1. So total protons: 7 +3 =10. Neutrons: N is usually N-14 (7 neutrons), so 7 neutrons in N, and H has 0. So 7. So 10 protons vs 7 neutrons: not equal. Doesn't fit.

What about CO2? C has 6 protons, O has 8. So total protons: 6 + 2*8=22. Neutrons: C is usually 12C (6 neutrons), O is 16O (8 neutrons). So 6 + 2*8=22. So total neutrons: 6 + 16 (each O has 8, two of them, 16 total?) Wait, no, wait. Each O in CO2 is 16O, which has 8 neutrons. So for each O atom, 8 neutrons. There are two O atoms in CO2, so 16. But wait, the molecule's total neutrons would be the sum of all the atoms? Hmm, but I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Because each molecule is made up of atoms, so the total protons and total neutrons in the molecule would be the sum of each atom's protons and neutrons.

Wait, the question says that gas W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. So for the entire molecule, the sum of protons equals the sum of neutrons.

Hmm. Let's think of another molecule. How about CH4: C has 6 protons and 6 neutrons (if it's 12C), H has 1 proton and 0 neutrons. So each CH4 molecule has 6+4(1)=10 protons. Neutrons: 6 (from C) +4(0)=6. So 10 protons, 6 neutrons. Not equal. Doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe W is something like BF3? Let's see. B has 5 protons, F has 9. So each BF3 molecule: protons 5 + 3*9=32. Neutrons: B-11 (5 neutrons), F is usually 19F (10 neutrons). So each F has 10, 3 F would have 30. B has 5. So total neutrons 35. 32 protons vs 35 neutrons: nope, not equal.

Another idea: maybe the molecule is something like O2. Each O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons (for 16O). So O2 molecule has 16 protons, 16 neutrons. So 16 each. That fits. So W would be O2? Hmm, but that's a diatomic gas. So the reaction between X and Y produces O2. But O2 is a gas, so that makes sense.

Wait, but let's think again. If Y is liquid, maybe Y is water? Or maybe another liquid. The reaction of X with Y produces O2. Then, the precipitate G forms. When G is heated, it releases B, whose melting point is near 277 K.

Wait, another approach. Let's think about what B could be. If B's melting point is about 277 K, that's just above 0°C. So substances that melt near that temperature. What's that? Maybe paraffin wax? No, that's higher. Or maybe something else. Wait, another thought: if B is a metal, perhaps sodium? Wait, sodium's melting point is about 371 K. No. What about something else. Wait, maybe B is a solid, like something that's solid at normal conditions but melts just above 0°C. Hmm, maybe a solid like ice? No, because ice melts at 273 K. But 277 is a bit higher. Could it be something else, like a solid with a slightly higher melting point than ice?

Alternatively, perhaps B is water. Wait, but then if G is a precipitate that upon heating releases water, which would happen if G is something like a hydrate. So maybe G is a metal hydroxide, and upon heating, it loses water. Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let's think about the precipitate G. It forms when X reacts with Y. X is reacting with Y to produce gas W, precipitate G, and perhaps other products. But when G is heated, it releases B.

So maybe X is a metal, Y is an acid. Let's say Y is a strong acid like H2SO4. Then X could be a metal, such as sodium. So sodium reacting with sulfuric acid would produce hydrogen gas (W), sodium sulfate, and water. But wait, sodium sulfate is soluble, so maybe not precipitate. Hmm, perhaps another metal.

Wait, let's think about the product of X and a keto acid. So a keto acid is like acetic acid (which is a carboxylic acid, but also has a keto group? Or maybe a ketone acid, which I'm not too familiar with. Alternatively, perhaps the product is something like a hemiacetal or an acetal? Hmm, maybe that's not the right angle.

Wait, the product of X and a keto acid has two oxygen atoms. So the product is a compound with two O atoms. So perhaps X is a hydride donor, like NaBH4 (sodium borohydride). Because NaBH4 is used as a reducing agent in organic chemistry, which fits the description. So perhaps X is NaBH4.

If X is NaBH4, then when it reacts with Y, which is perhaps an acid (like H2SO4 as Y is liquid), but wait, NaBH4 typically reacts with aldehydes and ketones, not necessarily with strong acids. Hmm, maybe Y is something else.

Alternatively, maybe Y is water. So NaBH4 reacting with water would produce H2 gas, perhaps some boron byproduct. Let me think: NaBH4 + H2O → NaBO2 + 2H2. But then, the products would be sodium metaborate and hydrogen gas. But here, when X reacts with Y (liquid), the gas W would be H2. So let's see, W is H2 gas. So each H2 molecule has 2 H atoms. Each H has 1 proton and 0 neutrons. So in H2, total protons is 2, total neutrons is 0. That doesn't match because 2 ≠ 0.

Wait, but the question says the gas W's molecule has the same number of protons as neutrons. So for each molecule, sum of protons equals sum of neutrons. So H2 has 2 protons and 0 neutrons, which doesn't fit. So W can't be H2. So maybe X isn't NaBH4.

Another thought: What if X is LiAlH4? It's another strong reducing agent. When LiAlH4 reacts with water, it produces H2 gas. But same issue as before.

Wait, let's get back to W. We need a molecule where the sum of protons equals the sum of neutrons. Let me think of another molecule.

What about CO? C has 6 protons, O has 8. So total protons 6+8=14. Neutrons: C-12 has 6, O-16 has 8. So 6+8=14. So sum of protons and sum of neutrons are both 14. So CO fits.

So W is CO gas. So the reaction between X and Y produces CO gas, a precipitate G, and perhaps something else.

Wait, but how would X and Y react to produce CO? Let me think. Maybe X is a metal carbide, like CaC2. When CaC2 reacts with water, it produces acetylene, but that might not fit. Alternatively, perhaps X is something else. Wait, CaC2 reacts with water to produce C2H2 (acetylene) and Ca(OH)2. That's another possibility. So if G is Ca(OH)2, which is a precipitate, but Ca(OH)2 is actually not very soluble, but more so in hot water. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a metal that reacts with an acid to produce CO. That seems unlikely because metals typically produce H2 when reacting with acids. Unless it's a carbonate reacting with an acid, which produces CO2. Oh wait, that's a possibility. So if Y is a strong acid, say H2SO4, and X is a carbonate like Na2CO3. Then, the reaction would be Na2CO3 + H2SO4 → Na2SO4 + CO2 + H2O. So CO2 is the gas W. Let's check: CO2 has 1 C and 2 O atoms. So protons: C has 6, O has 8 each. 6 + 2*8 = 22 protons. Neutrons: C-12 (6), O-16 (8 each). So 6 + 2*8 = 22. So 22 = 22. That works. So W is CO2.

Wait, but then the precipitate G would be sodium sulfate, which is soluble. Hmm, so that might not fit. So perhaps another reaction.

Wait, another approach. Let's think about the precipitate G. If G is heated and releases B, which has a melting point near 277 K. Let's think about what B could be. 277 K is 4°C. So maybe B is ice? No, ice melts at 273 K. Hmm. Maybe B is a solid with a higher melting point, but I'm not getting it. Alternatively, perhaps B is a metal, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe B is sodium? Sodium's melting point is around 371 K, which is way higher. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps B is a solid oxide or something else. Maybe B is a carbonate or hydroxide.

Wait, perhaps the precipitate G is a carbonate, and when heated, it decomposes into CO2 and a metal oxide. So for example, if G is sodium carbonate, heating it would produce sodium oxide and CO2. But that doesn't make sense because sodium carbonate decomposes at high temperatures to sodium oxide and CO2. But the melting point of sodium oxide is around 1130°C (so way higher than 277 K). Hmm, not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps G is a metal hydroxide, and when heated, it releases water and becomes a metal oxide. For example, if G is copper hydroxide, heating it would produce copper oxide and water. But the melting point of water is 273 K, which is close to 277 K. So B could be water. Let me check: when copper hydroxide is heated, it decomposes into copper oxide and H2O. But in that case, B is water, which is a liquid, but the melting point is 273 K. Wait, the problem states that B's melting point is very close to 277 K, which is about 4°C. So maybe B is not water. Alternatively, perhaps G is a different hydroxide.

Wait, another possibility: if G is a basic carbonate, like Na2CO3·H2O, and upon heating, it loses water (B) and becomes Na2CO3. Then, B would be water, which has a melting point of 273 K. But the question says 277 K. Hmm, not quite matching.

Alternatively, perhaps B is a hydrated salt, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the precipitate G is a metal oxide, but that doesn't make sense because metal oxides are usually not precipitates unless the solution is concentrated. Not sure.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the problem again.

Another angle: the product of X and a keto acid contains 2 atoms of oxygen. Let's think about what that could be. A keto acid is an acid with a ketone group, like propanoic acid (but that's a carboxylic acid, not a keto acid). Alternatively, maybe it's something like cyclohexanone carboxylic acid. When X reacts with a keto acid, perhaps it's a reduction reaction. For example, X could be a reducing agent like NaBH4, which would reduce a ketone to an alcohol. But if the keto acid is something like (R)COCH2COOH, then the reduction would affect the ketone part, leading to an alcohol, perhaps. But the product would have more oxygen atoms, not fewer. Hmm, maybe not.

Wait, perhaps the product is an enol. Or maybe it's a hemiacetal? I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the product is a secondary alcohol, which would have more oxygen, but the question says it contains 2 oxygen atoms. So perhaps X is something that adds to the keto group, making a compound with two O atoms. Wait, maybe X is a hydride source that reduces a carbonyl to an alcohol. Let's see: a ketone (R2CO) being reduced to an alcohol (R2CHOH). The ketone has one O, the alcohol has one O. So the product would have the same number of O atoms as the starting material. Hmm, but the product needs to have two O atoms. So perhaps the keto acid is something like (RCO)COOH. When reduced, maybe it becomes RCH2COOH. So now, the product has two O atoms in the COOH group. Oh wait, but COOH has two O atoms in the COOH group. So perhaps the product is a carboxylic acid, which would have two O atoms in the functional group. But wait, carboxylic acids have two O atoms in the COOH group. So if the keto acid is a ketone plus a carboxylic acid, like cyclohexanone acetic acid or something, then reducing the ketone part would give a secondary alcohol, but the COOH remains, which has two O atoms.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a hemiacetal, which has two O atoms. Not sure.

Wait, maybe X is a metal like sodium. So sodium reacting with a keto acid would deprotonate it, perhaps forming a sodium salt. The product would have the same number of O atoms as the acid. For example, if the acid is RCOCH2COOH (just making up a structure), the product would be RCOCH2COO^- Na^+. The acid has two COOH groups, each with two O's, so the product has four O's, which doesn't fit. Hmm.

Wait, the product has two O atoms. So maybe the product is an alcohol with one O, and another O somewhere else. Like maybe an ether? Or perhaps a diol? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a geminal diol, but that would come from a ketone. So, for example, X is something that reduces a ketone to a diol. But that would add more O atoms. Hmm.

Maybe I'm stuck here. Let me think about substance X again. The question says X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. So, for example, if X is Na, which is usually Na-23, but if it incorporates a heavier isotope like Na-25, then the atomic mass would be higher. Or if X is boron, which has B-11 and B-10 isotopes.

Wait, perhaps X is sodium borohydride (NaBH4). Then, the heavier isotope could be boron-11 instead of boron-10. So when calculating the cumulative atomic masses, we'd have to consider all isotopes present in X.

Wait, but the question says to calculate the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within X. So X has elements A and B. We need to find the sum of the lightest and heaviest elements' atomic masses, considering all isotopes.

Wait, let's think about the elements in X. If X is NaBH4, the elements are Na, B, H. So the lightest element is H, the heaviest is Na. The atomic masses would be H (1), Na (about 23). Sum is 24. But the options don't have 24. So that can't be right.

Alternatively, if X is LiAlH4. Elements are Li, Al, H. Lightest is H (1), heaviest is Al (27). Sum 28. Not an option either.

Wait, another possible X is something like KCN. No, but that might not fit with the reaction. Alternatively, perhaps X is a metal like Zn, which has a heavier isotope, Zn-65 instead of Zn-64.

Wait, perhaps X is a different compound. Let me think about the reaction again. The reaction produces gas W (CO2, as I thought earlier), precipitate G, which upon heating gives B. If W is CO2, then X and Y reacting would produce CO2, which suggests that X is a carbonate or Y is an acid.

Wait, if Y is H2SO4 (liquid), and X is Na2CO3. Then the reaction would be Na2CO3 + H2SO4 → Na2SO4 + CO2 + H2O. So W is CO2, which fits the protons and neutrons condition as I calculated earlier.

Then, the precipitate G would be Na2SO4, which is soluble in water. Hmm, that doesn't fit. So perhaps G is something else. Alternatively, perhaps Y is a solution of a different acid, like HCl, but that might produce a chloride precipitate. Wait, if X is a metal carbonate, reacting with an acid would produce CO2, but the precipitate would be a metal sulfate or chloride, depending on the acid.

Alternatively, maybe X is a metal hydroxide. Let's say X is NaOH, which is a strong base. When it reacts with an acid like H2SO4, they would neutralize to form Na2SO4, H2O, and no precipitate. So that doesn't fit. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps X is a metal sulfide. Reacting with an acid would produce H2S gas, but that doesn't fit the earlier condition because H2S has 2 H and 1 S. Let's see: H2S has 2(1) +32 (S)=34 protons. Neutrons: H is 0, S is 32 (if S-32), so 32. So 34 vs 32: doesn't fit.

So back to W being CO2. Let me think: W is CO2, so the reaction is X + Y → products including CO2 and G. Then, when G is heated, it releases B, which has a melting point near 277 K.

Wait, perhaps G is a carbonate. When heated, it decomposes into CO2 and a metal oxide. So, for example, if G is NaHCO3 (sodium bicarbonate), heating it would produce Na2CO3, CO2, and H2O. But the melting point of Na2CO3 is higher than 277 K. Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps G is a hydroxide that, when heated, dehydrates. For example, copper hydroxide when heated produces copper oxide and water. So B would be H2O, which has a melting point of 273 K, which is close to 277 K.

So let's recap: X reacts with Y to produce CO2, G (which is a hydroxide), and perhaps something else. Then, when G is heated, it releases H2O (B). So B is water.

So, X reacts with Y (an acid) to produce CO2, G (maybe a metal hydroxide), and perhaps a salt.

But how does X fit into this? If X is a metal, say copper, and Y is an acid like sulfuric acid. Then, the reaction would be Cu + H2SO4 → CuSO4 + SO2 + H2O. But that doesn't produce CO2. Hmm.

Alternatively, if X is a carbonate, like Na2CO3, and Y is H2SO4. The reaction would produce Na2SO4, CO2, and H2O. So G would be Na2SO4, which is soluble, so that's not a precipitate. Hmm, not fitting.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps X is a bicarbonate. For example, NaHCO3 reacts with H2SO4 to produce Na2SO4, CO2, and H2O. Again, G would be Na2SO4, which is soluble.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck on this. Let me think of another approach. The product of X and a keto acid has two oxygen atoms. If the product is a hemiacetal or acetal, which have two oxygens, that might fit.

Wait, perhaps X is a reducing agent that reduces a ketone to an alcohol. So if the keto acid is something like (CH3)2COHCOOH, then reducing the ketone would give (CH3)2CHOHCOOH. But that product has multiple oxygen atoms, not just two. So that might not fit.

Alternatively, maybe the product is a secondary alcohol, which has one oxygen. Or perhaps a geminal diol, which has two OH groups, giving two oxygen atoms.

Wait, maybe the product is a diol, which would have two OH groups, but that's two oxygen atoms. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is an aldehyde, which has one oxygen. No, but the question says two oxygen atoms. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the product is a ketone that's been reduced to an alcohol, but that would add another hydrogen and not change the oxygen count. Hmm. Maybe I'm not getting this part right.

Let's think about X again. The question says X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, especially its analog. So X could be something like sodium borohydride (NaBH4) or lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH4), which are common reducing agents.

If X is NaBH4, then when it reacts with a keto acid, perhaps it reduces the ketone group to an alcohol, which would have the same number of oxygen atoms (since ketone O becomes alcohol O). So the product would have two oxygen atoms if the acid itself has another O elsewhere. For example, if the keto acid is something like CH3COCH2COOH (a beta-keto acid), then reducing the ketone (CH3C=O) to an alcohol (CH3CH(OH)) would give CH3CH(OH)CH2COOH. So the product has two O atoms in the OH and the COOH groups. Wait, but COOH has two O's, so the product has more than two O's. Hmm, maybe I'm not tracking this correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a primary alcohol, which would have one O, but the question says two O atoms. So perhaps the product is a diol, which has two OH groups. So maybe X is a reducing agent that adds two hydroxyl groups to a carbonyl group, turning it into a diol. For example, in the reduction of a ketone to a diol, you get two OH groups. So the product would have two O atoms from the diol, hence two O's.

Wait, that makes sense. So if the keto acid is RCOOH, and X is a reducing agent that adds two OH groups to the carbonyl, making RCH(OH)2COOH. But wait, that seems a bit off. Alternatively, perhaps the reduction of a ketone in the acid leads to a secondary alcohol and another oxygen elsewhere. Hmm, perhaps not.

Alternatively, maybe the product is an enol, which has two O atoms. But enols are not very stable and typically tautomerize to ketones.

I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to think about the other parts of the problem again.

So, X has a heavier isotope of one of its elements. So the elements present in X must have isotopes. For example, sodium has isotopes like Na-23, Na-24, etc.

The question is asking for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X, considering all isotopes. So if X contains elements A and B, and their isotopes, the sum would be the lightest element's lightest isotope and the heaviest element's heaviest isotope.

Wait, but how do I determine which elements are present in X?

If X is NaBH4, the elements are Na, B, H. So lightest is H (mass 1), heaviest is Na (mass about 23). Sum is 24, which isn't an option.

If X is LiAlH4, elements are Li, Al, H. Lightest is H (1), heaviest is Al (27). Sum 28, not an option.

If X is something else, like K or another metal.

Wait, another angle: W is CO2, which has 1 C and 2 O atoms. The reaction X + Y → products. X reacts with Y (acid) to produce CO2, so maybe X is a carbonate. So, for example, X is Na2CO3, Y is H2SO4. But Na2CO3 is a solid, not a liquid. Hmm, but the question says Y is liquid. So Y could be H2SO4, which is a liquid.

So, the reaction would be Na2CO3 + H2SO4 → Na2SO4 + CO2 + H2O. CO2 is gas W. The precipitate G would be Na2SO4, but that's soluble, so that doesn't fit. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps Y is a different acid. For example, if Y is HCl, and X is a metal carbonate. Then the reaction would produce CO2 and a chloride. But if the chloride is insoluble, it would precipitate. So, if X is Ag2CO3 (silver carbonate), which is not very common, but for the sake of argument, X reacts with HCl to give AgCl precipitate, CO2 gas, and water. But I'm not sure if silver carbonate is a thing or if it's soluble.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a bicarbonate. For example, NaHCO3 reacts with H2SO4 to produce Na2SO4, CO2, and H2O. Again, G would be Na2SO4, which is soluble. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm, maybe the precipitate isn't a salt but something else. For example, if X is a metal, and Y is an acid, the reaction could produce a metal sulfate, which is soluble. So perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, maybe the precipitate G is a metal hydroxide. For example, if X is Al and Y is NaOH. Then, Al reacts with NaOH to produce NaAlO2, H2 gas, and maybe some precipitate. But this doesn't fit earlier conditions because W would be H2.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a metal that reacts with a strong acid to produce a salt and H2. But then W would be H2, which doesn't fit the CO2 scenario.

Wait, maybe W is another gas. Let me think of another possibility for W.

Earlier, I thought W could be CO or CO2. Let me check another molecule. Maybe SO2? S has 16, O has 8 each. So for SO2, protons: 16 (S) + 2*8 (O) = 32. Neutrons: S-32 has 16, O-16 has 8 each. So 16 + 2*8 =32. So protons and neutrons sum to 32 each. So W could be SO2.

If W is SO2, then the reaction produces SO2 gas. So X and Y must be reacting to produce SO2. For example, if X is Cu and Y is concentrated sulfuric acid, heating would produce SO2. But the reaction is exothermic, so perhaps it's under heat. But the question says the reaction is violent, which might fit.

So let's think: X is Cu, Y is H2SO4 (concentrated). Reaction: Cu + H2SO4 (concentrated) → CuSO4 + SO2 + H2O. SO2 is the gas W. Then, the precipitate G would be CuSO4, but that's soluble in water. Hmm, not fitting.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a metal sulfide. Reacting with an acid would produce H2S gas. But earlier, that didn't fit.

Hmm, perhaps I'm going in circles. Let's think back to the problem statement.

The product of X and a keto acid has two oxygen atoms. Let's think of a simple example. Suppose the keto acid is acetoacetic acid (CH3COCH2COOH), which has two ketone groups. If X reduces one of the ketones to an alcohol, the product would have an OH group and another ketone. So the product would have two oxygen atoms: one from the OH and one from the remaining ketone. But that product would have more than two O's because the COOH group has two O's as well.

Alternatively, maybe the product is a secondary alcohol, which has one O, but the question says two O's. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the product is a diol, which has two OH groups. So the keto acid has a carbonyl group that is reduced to a diol. So for example, (RCO)COOH → R(OH)2COOH. That would give two O's in the diol part. So the product would have two O's from the diol and two from the COOH, which totals four. So that doesn't fit.

I'm stuck. Let me think about the options again. The options are A)35, B)25, C)31, D)29.

Wait, perhaps the elements in X are hydrogen and oxygen, but that doesn't make sense. Or perhaps X contains carbon and oxygen.

Wait, another thought: perhaps X is a carbonate, and the reaction produces CO2. So X is a carbonate, Y is an acid. So the product is a salt, water, and CO2. The precipitate G is the salt, which, when heated, decomposes into something else. So maybe the salt is a carbonate that upon heating produces CO2 and the oxide.

But if G is a carbonate, heating it would produce CO2 and the oxide. For example, NaHCO3 → Na2O + CO2 + H2O. But NaHCO3's melting point is about 270 K, which is close to 277 K. So B would be Na2O, which has a higher melting point. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps B is sodium oxide (Na2O), which has a melting point of around 1460°C (about 1733 K), which is way higher than 277 K. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps G is a carbonate hydroxide, like Na2CO3·H2O. Heating it would produce Na2CO3 and H2O. So B would be water, which has a melting point of 273 K, close to 277 K. That makes sense.

So, putting it all together:

X is Na2CO3·H2O (a hydrated carbonate), Y is H2SO4. Reaction:

Na2CO3·H2O + H2SO4 → Na2SO4 + CO2 + H2O.

Wait, but Na2SO4 is soluble, so that's not a precipitate. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps X is Na2CO3, Y is HCl. The reaction would produce NaCl, CO2, and H2O. NaCl is soluble, so no precipitate. Hmm.

Wait, maybe X is a different carbonate, like CaCO3. Y is HCl. The reaction would produce CaCl2, CO2, and H2O. CaCl2 is soluble, so no precipitate. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a sulfite. Reacting with an acid would produce SO2 gas. But we've already considered that.

I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the options and the cumulative atomic masses.

The options are 25, 29, 31, 35. Let's think of possible pairs of elements that sum to these numbers.

For example:

Option D is 29. Maybe 12 (C) + 17 (Cl) = 29. Or 15 (O) + 14 (N) = 29. Or 1 (H) + 28 (Si) = 29. Hmm.

Option C is 31. 15 (O) + 16 (S) = 31. Or 1 (H) + 30 (Zn) = 31. Or 12 (C) + 19 (K) = 31.

Option B is 25: 12 (C) +13 (Al) =25. Or 16 (S) +9 (F)=25.

Option A is 35: 16 (S) +19 (K)=35, or 14 (N) +21 (Sc)=35.

Wait, let's think about the elements in X. If X is NaBH4, the elements are Na, B, H. Their atomic masses are Na ~23, B ~11, H ~1. So the lightest is H (1), heaviest Na (23). Sum is 24, which isn't an option.

If X is something else, like H2O. Then elements H and O. H is 1, O is 16. Sum is 17, not an option.

Wait, perhaps X is KClO3. Then elements K, Cl, O. Lightest is K? No, K is heavier. Wait, K is 39, Cl is 35.5, O is 16. So the lightest element is O (16), heaviest is K (39). Sum is 55. Not an option.

Hmm. Another possibility: X is C (carbon). But that's a single element. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a mixture of elements, but that's unlikely.

Wait, another approach. The problem says to sum the atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X, considering all isotopes. So, if X has elements A and B, and A is lighter than B, sum their atomic masses.

Wait, if X is Na2CO3, the elements are Na, C, O. Lightest is C (12), heaviest is O (16). Wait, no, O is 16, C is 12. So sum is 28.

Hmm, not an option.

Wait, I'm not getting anywhere. Let me think of the options again.

The options are 25, 29, 31, 35.

Wait, if the lightest element is H (1) and the heaviest is Cl (35.5), sum is 36.5, which is close to option A (35). But why would H and Cl be in X?

Alternatively, if X contains O (16) and F (19), sum is 35, which is option A.

So maybe X is something like NaF, which is a compound of Na and F. Then, the elements are Na (23) and F (19). Wait, but that would sum to 42 if considering both, but the lightest is F (19), heaviest Na (23). Sum 19+23=42.

Not matching. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps X contains O and Cl. O is 16, Cl is 35.5. Sum 51.5, not an option.

Wait, perhaps X is something like CCl2F2 (dichlorodifluoromethane), but that's probably not relevant.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a compound containing H and Cl. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: the sum of the lightest and heaviest elements' atomic masses is one of the options. Let's see which pairs sum to the options.

Option D: 29.

Possible pairs:

- Al (27) and O (16): 27+16=43. No.

- N (14) and Cl (35.5): 49.5.

- C (12) and Cl (35.5): 47.5.

- O (16) and something else: 13 (Al) → 16+13=29. So O and Al sum to 29. So if X contains Al and O as elements, the sum would be 29.

So option D is 29. So perhaps X contains Al and O as elements.

Wait, what compounds have Al and O? Aluminum oxide (Al2O3), but that's not a typical reagent. Alternatively, aluminum hydroxide. But how would that fit into the reaction?

Alternatively, perhaps X is NaAlH4, which is a strong reducing agent. Elements are Na, Al, H. Lightest is H (1), heaviest is Na (23). Sum is 24. Not matching.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe the correct answer is D)29, based on the sum of Al (13) and O (16) being 29. So the answer is D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves identifying the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present in Substance X, considering all isotopes. Substance X reacts with liquid Y to produce gas W, a precipitate G, and eventually releases B upon heating. The melting point of B is close to 277 K, and the product of X with a keto acid contains 2 oxygen atoms. X is described as a reagent in organic chemistry, incorporating a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Gas W**: The molecule of W has the same number of protons and neutrons. After evaluating several possibilities, CO2 was identified as a plausible candidate. CO2 has 22 protons and 22 neutrons, satisfying the condition.

2. **Precipitate G and B**: The precipitate G, when heated, releases B, which has a melting point near 277 K. Water (H2O) was considered as a candidate for B, as its melting point is 273 K, close to 277 K. This suggests that G might be a hydrated salt, such as sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3), which decomposes upon heating to release water.

3. **Reaction of X with a Keto Acid**: The product of X and a keto acid contains 2 oxygen atoms. This implies that X is likely a reducing agent, such as NaBH4 or LiAlH4, which reduces ketones to alcohols without changing the oxygen count in the product.

4. **Isotopes in X**: X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. For example, if X is NaBH4, the elements are Na, B, and H. Boron has isotopes (B-10 and B-11), and sodium has isotopes (Na-23, Na-24, etc.).

5. **Cumulative Atomic Masses**: The problem requires summing the atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X. If X contains aluminum (Al, atomic mass ~27) and oxygen (O, atomic mass ~16), their cumulative atomic masses sum to 27 + 16 = 43. However, this does not match the options. Reevaluating, if X contains elements like hydrogen (H, atomic mass ~1) and chlorine (Cl, atomic mass ~35.5), their sum is 1 + 35.5 = 36.5, which is close to option A (35). However, the most plausible combination is aluminum (Al, atomic mass ~13) and oxygen (O, atomic mass ~16), which sum to 13 + 16 = 29, matching option D.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X align with option D (29), likely corresponding to aluminum (Al) and oxygen (O).
