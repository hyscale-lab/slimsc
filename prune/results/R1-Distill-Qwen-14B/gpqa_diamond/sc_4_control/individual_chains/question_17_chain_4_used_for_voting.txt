Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, let's try to figure this out step by step.

The question says the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M. The given K for the complex (K_Ca-EDTA) is 5x10^10. The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25 degrees Celsius. I need to find the concentration of free calcium ions.

Wait, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, which means it binds metal ions like calcium. The complex formed is a stable one because the K is really large, so the complex doesn't dissociate much under normal conditions.

So, the reaction involved is probably something like Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA²- (the complex). The K for this reaction is given as 5e10. K is the formation constant, right?

The formation constant Kf is equal to [CaEDTA²-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]). So, if we have a solution where the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, then we can write Kf = [Complex]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]).

But wait, in solution, the EDTA exists in different protonated forms depending on pH. Oh, but the problem says the pH is ideal. Oh right, for EDTA, the ideal pH is usually around 10 where it's in its Y^4- form. So, assuming that all the EDTA is in the Y^4- form, which simplifies things because we don't have to consider other protonated forms.

So, the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. The problem is to find the concentration of free Ca²+ ions.

Let's think about the dissociation of the complex. The complex dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-.

Let me set up an ICE table maybe. Let's let s be the concentration of Ca²+ that dissociates from the complex.

At equilibrium, [CaEDTA²-] = 0.02 - s ≈ 0.02 (since K is so large, s will be really small compared to 0.02).

[Ca²+] = s, and [EDTA^4-] = s as well because each mole of complex gives one mole of each.

Wait, no. Wait, the complex is dissociating into one Ca²+ and one EDTA^4-. So, if the initial concentration of complex is 0.02, and it dissociates to x amount, then:

[Ca²+] = x
[EDTA^4-] = x
[Complex] = 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02 since x is so small.

So, substituting into Kf:

Kf = [Complex]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]) = 0.02/(x * x) = 0.02/(x²) = 5e10.

So, 0.02/(x²) = 5e10. Solving for x²:

x² = 0.02 / (5e10) = (2e-2) / (5e10) = (2/5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12.

Wait, 0.02 is 2e-2. So, 2e-2 divided by 5e10 is 4e-13.

Wait, 2e-2 /5e10 = (2/5) * 1e-12 = 0.4 *1e-12 = 4e-13.

Wait, no, 2e-2 is 0.02. 5e10 is 50,000,000,000.

So 0.02 /5e10 = (2e-2)/(5e10) = (2/5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13.

So x² = 4e-13. So x is sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5. Wait, sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5? Wait, no, sqrt(4)=2, sqrt(1e-13)=1e-6.5? Because (1e-6.5)^2 = 1e-13.

So, x=2e-6.5. Wait, 1e-6 is 1e-6, 1e-7 is 0.1e-6. So 1e-6.5 is approximately 3.16e-7. So 2 * 3.16e-7 is about 6.32e-7.

Wait, let me calculate it more accurately. sqrt(4e-13) = sqrt(4)*sqrt(1e-13) = 2 * (1e-6.5) = 2 * (3.1623e-7) ≈ 6.3246e-7.

So x is approximately 6.32e-7 M. That's the concentration of Ca²+.

Looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M. So that's the answer.

But wait, let me think again. EDTA is a hexadentate ligand, meaning it can bind six sites, but in this case, it's forming a 1:1 complex with Ca²+. But wait, maybe I should double-check the dissociation equation. The complex is Ca-EDTA, so each complex gives one Ca²+ and one EDTA^4-.

So the setup was correct. So the calculation makes sense. So the answer should be C.

To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex, we use the formation constant \( K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = 5 \times 10^{10} \). The dissociation of the complex can be represented as:

\[
\text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{4-} \leftrightarrow \text{CaEDTA}^{2-}
\]

The equilibrium expression is:

\[
K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = \frac{[\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}
\]

Let the concentration of free \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\) ions at equilibrium be \(x\). Since the dissociation of the complex produces equal concentrations of \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\) and \(\text{EDTA}^{4-}\), both \([\text{Ca}^{2+}]\) and \([\text{EDTA}^{4-}]\) are equal to \(x\). The concentration of the complex \([\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]\) is approximately \(0.02 - x\), but since \(x\) is very small compared to \(0.02\), we approximate \([\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]\) as \(0.02\).

Substituting into the equilibrium expression:

\[
K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = \frac{0.02}{x^2}
\]

\[
5 \times 10^{10} = \frac{0.02}{x^2}
\]

Solving for \(x^2\):

\[
x^2 = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}} = \frac{2 \times 10^{-2}}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} \approx 6.32 \times 10^{-7}
\]

Thus, the concentration of free \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\) ions is approximately \(6.3 \times 10^{-7}\) M. Comparing this result with the options, the correct answer is:

**C) \(6.3 \times 10^{-7}\) M**
