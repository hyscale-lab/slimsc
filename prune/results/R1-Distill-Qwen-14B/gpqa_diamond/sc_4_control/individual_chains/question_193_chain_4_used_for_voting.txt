Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. So the formula is like N ∝ 1/plx^5. Wait, parallax is usually denoted by 'p' or sometimes 'plx', right? So N is the number of stars, and it's inversely proportional to plx^5.

The question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance. Specifically, it's per unit range of distance, r. So I think I need to relate parallax to distance and then see how N changes with r.

I remember that parallax (p) is related to distance (d) in parsecs. The formula is p = 1/d. So if d increases, p decreases. That's the basic inverse relationship between parallax and distance.

But wait, in this problem, the number of stars varies as 1/p^5. So substituting p = 1/d into that, N would be proportional to 1/(1/d)^5. Let's calculate that. 1 divided by (1/d) is d, so (d)^5. So N ∝ d^5?

Wait, but the question is about how the number changes with distance. Hmm. Or does it? Actually, wait, the question says "how does the number of stars... change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)." So maybe it's about the density of stars as a function of distance.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's think again. The number of stars in a region of the sky depends on how many are located at various distances. The parallax is 1/d, so if you have a certain range of parallax, how does that translate to distance?

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the number of stars as a function of distance. So if N ∝ 1/p^5, and p = 1/d, then N ∝ d^5. But wait, that can't be right because when d increases, p decreases, and 1/p^5 increases.

But wait, the number of stars you observe depends on how many are at a given distance. So maybe it's more about the density of stars along the line of sight. Let me think about it in terms of flux or the distribution.

Wait, another approach: The number of stars in a certain volume. The volume depends on the distance. Suppose we consider a thin shell at distance d with thickness dr. The volume of such a shell is approximately 4πd² dr. So the number of stars in that shell would be proportional to the volume multiplied by the number density of stars.

But wait, the problem states that N varies as 1/p^5. Let me think about N as a function of p. So N(p) = k / p^5, where k is some constant. Since p = 1/d, N(p) = k d^5. So that suggests that as d increases, N increases as d^5. But wait, that can't be correct because as you look further away, you'd expect the number of stars to increase, but perhaps not as steeply as d^5.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about the number of stars per unit area, which is the concept of star density on the sky. Wait, but the question is about how the number changes with distance, so maybe we're considering the number in a certain distance range.

Wait, maybe I should think about a differential. The number of stars in a range of distance dr is dn, and we want dn in terms of r (I think the question says r, but maybe they meant d, but I'll proceed). So if N ∝ 1/p^5, and p=1/d, then N ∝ d^5. So if you're looking at the number of stars in a thin shell dr, then dn would be proportional to d^5 dr. But wait, I think I'm getting tangled.

Wait, another approach: The number of stars within a certain parallax range (like between p and p+dp) would be some function. But perhaps it's better to think in terms of differential number per distance.

Wait, let me write down the relations.

Given N ∝ 1 / p^5.

And p = 1/d → d = 1/p.

So, substituting p in terms of d,

N ∝ 1/( (1/d) )^5 → N ∝ d^5.

So N is proportional to d^5.

But wait, N is the number of stars in a region of the sky. So if you have a larger d, more stars? That might seem counterintuitive because stars farther away are less bright, but perhaps the distribution of stars is such that more are present at larger distances.

But the question is asking about the change in the number of stars per unit distance. So perhaps it's about the density of stars as a function of distance.

Alternatively, perhaps I need to think about the number of stars per unit volume. But since we're considering a region of the sky, which is a projection, it's more about the surface density.

Wait, another thought: The number of stars in a given area (like per square degree) at a distance d depends on the volume of the sphere of radius d. Because more distant regions have larger volumes, hence more stars. But in this case, the problem says the number varies as 1/p^5, which is d^5. So the number of stars increases as d^5.

Wait, but stars are not distributed in an expanding way with distance. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, let's imagine that the number of stars in a certain area is N = k * d^5, where k is some constant. Now, if you want to find how the number changes with distance, in terms of per unit distance, that's the derivative of N with respect to d.

So dN/dd = 5 k d^4.

So the number of stars per unit distance increases as d^4. But wait, that's for each small change in distance. So the number of stars in a thin shell dr is approximately dN =5k d^4 dr.

Wait, but the problem says the number varies as 1/p^5. And we're to find how it changes with distance, per unit range.

Wait, perhaps the question is more about the number of stars per unit distance, so the derivative of N with respect to d. Because if N ∝ d^5, then dN/dd ∝ d^4. So the number of stars per unit distance increases as d^4. So the answer would be r^4, which is option C.

Wait, but let me double-check. Because the initial setup is that N varies as 1/p^5. Let me re-express that in terms of d. Since p=1/d, then 1/p^5 = d^5. So N is proportional to d^5. So if you take the derivative of N with respect to d, you get the number of stars added per unit change in d. So dN/dd = 5 N0 d^4, where N0 is the constant of proportionality.

So for each unit increase in d, the number of stars increases by approximately 5 N0 d^4. So the number of stars per unit distance (the change) is proportional to d^4. So the correct answer would be option C, which is ~ r^4.

But wait, let me think again. The question states "the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5." So N ∝ 1/p^5. Therefore, N = k * (1/p)^5 → N = k p^{-5}. And since p = 1/d → N = k (1/(1/d))^5) = k d^5.

So N is proportional to d^5. So the number of stars increases with the fifth power of distance. But the question is, how does the number change with distance per unit range of distance? So perhaps it's the number of stars per unit distance. That would involve the derivative.

So dN/dd = 5k d^4. So the number of stars per unit distance (the rate of change) is proportional to d^4, which is option C.

Wait, but another way to think: If N ∝ d^5, then for a small change in d (dr), the change in N (dN) would be 5k d^4 dr. So the number per unit distance (dN/dr) is 5k d^4. So yes, it's proportional to r^4.

But wait, the options are about how the number 'changes with distance'. So the rate of change is proportional to r^4, so the correct option is C.

Wait another thing: If N ∝ d^5, then for a given distance range dr, the number of stars in that range is approximately 5k d^4 dr. So the number per unit distance (dN/dr) is 5k d^4. So the number of stars per unit distance increases as d^4, which is option C.

I think that's the right approach. So the answer should be option C, ~ r^4.

The problem states that the number of stars, \( N \), in a specific region of the sky varies with parallax \( p \) as \( N \propto 1/p^5 \). Since parallax is related to distance \( d \) by \( p = 1/d \), we can substitute \( p \) in terms of \( d \) to express \( N \) as a function of \( d \). Substituting \( p = 1/d \) into \( N \propto 1/p^5 \), we find:

\[
N \propto d^5
\]

This shows that the number of stars increases as the fifth power of distance. However, the question asks how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance, \( r \). To determine this, we calculate the derivative of \( N \) with respect to \( d \), which represents the rate of change of the number of stars with distance:

\[
\frac{dN}{dd} \propto d^4
\]

Thus, the number of stars per unit distance increases as \( d^4 \). Among the given options, this corresponds to \( \sim r^4 \).

**Critical analysis of the options:**
- **A) \( \sim r^3 \):** Incorrect, as the relationship derived is \( d^4 \), not \( d^3 \).
- **B) \( \sim r^5 \):** Incorrect, as \( r^5 \) represents the total number of stars, not the rate of change per unit distance.
- **C) \( \sim r^4 \):** Correct, as the rate of change of the number of stars with distance is proportional to \( d^4 \).
- **D) \( \sim r^2 \):** Incorrect, as there is no quadratic dependence in the derived relationship.

The correct answer is \( \sim r^4 \).
