Alright, so I've got this question here about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms. Let's try to unpack this step by step.

Okay, the question says that in star_1, iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. The energy difference between these levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. And we're assuming Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), so the usual formulas from that scenario apply.

Hmm, I remember that in LTE, the population of energy levels is described by the Boltzmann distribution. The formula is n_i / n_j = exp( - (E_i - E_j)/(k T) ), where n_i and n_j are the populations of two energy levels, E_i and E_j are their energies, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

In this problem, the energy difference ΔE is E_i - E_j = 1.38e-23 J. Wait, but wait: the problem says that the energy difference is approximately that value. So I should use that as ΔE = E_i - E_j = 1.38e-23 J.

The ratio given is that in star_1, the excited level is twice as excited as in star_2. So, for each star, I can write the ratio of the excited state population to the ground state (or another state) as follows.

For star_1: n1_i / n1_j = 2 (since it's twice as excited)
For star_2: n2_i / n2_j = let's say x. Wait, but the problem states that star_1 is twice as excited as star_2 in that level. Wait, no, actually, the problem states that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. So, probably, n1_i / n1_j = 2 * (n2_i / n2_j). Or wait, maybe it's that the ratio for star_1 is twice that of star_2. Let me clarify.

Wait, the exact wording: "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So, for the same energy level, the excitation (population) in star_1 is twice that in star_2. So, for star_1, n1_i = 2 * n2_i. Alternatively, perhaps the ratio n_i/n_j is twice as much for star_1 as star_2. Hmm, that's a more precise way.

Wait, the problem says: "twice as excited in a specific energy level." So, I think that for each star, the number of atoms in that level compared to another (say the ground state) is in a ratio. So for star_1, the ratio is higher than star_2.

Alternatively, perhaps each star has a certain ratio of excited to ground state atoms. So for star_1, the ratio is R1, for star_2, R2. The problem says R1 = 2 * R2.

Wait, but the problem says that the excitation is twice as much. So, perhaps the ratio of the excited state population to the lower state is twice as high in star_1 compared to star_2. So R1 = 2 R2.

So, we can write R1 = n1_i / n1_j = 2 * (n2_i / n2_j) = 2 R2.

But using the Boltzmann equation, each ratio depends on the temperature of the star. So for each star, n_i/n_j = exp( -ΔE/(k T) ). So, R1 = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ), R2 = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ).

Given that R1 = 2 R2. So:

exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Hmm, let's write this equation more clearly.

So,

exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

I can take the natural logarithm of both sides to make this easier. Let's do that.

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) + (-ΔE/(k T2) )

Let me rearrange this equation. Let me bring the terms involving T to one side.

-ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) = ln(2)

Factor ΔE/(k):

ΔE/(k) [ 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ] = ln(2 )

Wait, because (-1/T1) + (1/T2) = (T2 - T1)/(T1 T2) ) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) * (-1) ?

Wait, let me compute 1/T2 - 1/T1. That's (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2). Because (1/T2 -1/T1) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).

So, substituting back, we have:

ΔE/(k) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2 )

Wait, no, wait, because 1/T2 - 1/T1 = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2). So,

ΔE/(k) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2 )

Wait, but ΔE is positive because E_i > E_j, so that (E_i - E_j) is positive. So, let's see.

But wait, in the equation, it's [1/T2 - 1/T1], which is (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2). So, when I factor that in, the equation becomes:

(ΔE / (k)) * ( (T1 - T2) ) / (T1 T2 ) ) = ln(2 )

Wait, but I'm a bit confused about the signs. Let me go back through the steps.

The equation after taking logs was:

(-ΔE/(k T1)) = ln(2) + (-ΔE/(k T2) )

Bring the terms with T to the left:

(-ΔE/(k T1)) + (ΔE/(k T2)) = ln(2 )

Factor ΔE/(k):

ΔE/(k) [ -1/T1 + 1/T2 ] = ln(2 )

Which is the same as:

ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = ln(2 )

Which can be written as:

ΔE/(k) * ( (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ) ) = ln(2 )

Because 1/T2 -1/T1 = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

So,

(ΔE / (k )) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2 )

Now, let's see the options given. We can rearrange this equation to match one of the options.

Let me write it as:

ln(2) = [ (ΔE / k ) * (T1 - T2) ) ] / ( T1 T2 )

So,

ln(2) = (ΔE/(k) ) * (T1 - T2) / ( T1 T2 )

But looking at the options, the presence of T1 and T2 is in the numerator and denominator. Let me think about the options.

The problem gives four options, all in terms of T1 and T2. The equation I have is:

ln(2) = [ (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ) ] * (ΔE/(k) )

But the options don't directly include ΔE or k, so perhaps the equation can be rewritten in terms of T1 and T2 without these constants, but the fact is that the options only involve T1 and T2.

Wait, but the options don't include any constants. So perhaps in the given options, the equation is ln(2) equals some function of T1 and T2.

Looking at the options:

Option D: ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

So, according to my equation, ln(2) = [ (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) ] * (ΔE/(k) )

But the options don't have any ΔE or k in them. Hmm, that suggests that perhaps I made a mistake in my approach, because the options don't have those terms.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the energy difference ΔE is given, but maybe in the equation, the constants cancel out. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the ratio and the equation without the constants, which would require that (ΔE/(k)) is 1, which is not the case.

Wait, let me calculate ΔE/(k). Let's plug in the numbers.

ΔE = 1.38e-23 J.

k is Boltzmann's constant, approximately 1.38e-23 J/K.

So ΔE/(k) = (1.38e-23 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) ) = 1 K.

Wait, that's exactly 1. So ΔE/(k) = 1.

Ah! So that term becomes 1. So, substituting back into the equation:

ln(2) = (T1-T2)/(T1 T2 )

Which is exactly option D.

So the correct equation is ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

Looking at the options:

Option D is ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

So the correct answer is D.

To determine the relationship between the effective temperatures \( T_1 \) and \( T_2 \) of the two stars, we use the Boltzmann distribution under the assumption of Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). The Boltzmann distribution states:

\[
\frac{n_i}{n_j} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right),
\]

where \( n_i \) and \( n_j \) are the populations of two energy levels, \( \Delta E = E_i - E_j \) is the energy difference between the levels, \( k \) is Boltzmann's constant, and \( T \) is the temperature.

The problem states that the excitation of iron atoms in star_1 is twice that of star_2 in a specific energy level. This implies:

\[
\frac{n_{1i}}{n_{1j}} = 2 \cdot \frac{n_{2i}}{n_{2j}}.
\]

Using the Boltzmann distribution, the ratios for the two stars are:

\[
\frac{n_{1i}}{n_{1j}} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right), \quad \frac{n_{2i}}{n_{2j}} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right).
\]

Substituting these into the given relationship:

\[
\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right) = 2 \cdot \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right).
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1} = \ln(2) - \frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}.
\]

Rearranging terms:

\[
-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1} + \frac{\Delta E}{k T_2} = \ln(2).
\]

Factoring out \( \Delta E / k \):

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right) = \ln(2).
\]

Simplify \( \frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} \) as \( \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} \):

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \cdot \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} = \ln(2).
\]

The energy difference \( \Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \), and Boltzmann's constant \( k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K} \). Thus, \( \Delta E / k = 1 \). Substituting this:

\[
\frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} = \ln(2).
\]

This matches option D. Therefore, the correct equation for the effective temperatures is:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]
