Okay, I'm trying to figure out where this density matrix ρ is located in qubit space. So the matrix is given as ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). I remember that density matrices represent quantum states, and their position in space can be described using Bloch vectors. 

Wait, so for a single qubit, the Bloch sphere is a way to represent the state, right? Pure states are on the surface, and mixed states are inside. The Bloch vector is a vector (r) with components (x, y, z) that describe the state's position.

Let me think about the structure of ρ. Since it's a density matrix, it can be written in terms of the Pauli matrices. The general form is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices and r is the Bloch vector. So expanding that, each component of r corresponds to the coefficients in front of the Pauli matrices. 

The given ρ is (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)/2. Let me write |0⟩⟨0| in terms of Pauli matrices. I recall that |0⟩⟨0| can be written as (I + |0⟩⟨0| - |1⟩⟨1|)/2? Wait, no. Actually, |0⟩⟨0| is (I + σ_z)/2, because σ_z is [[1,0],[0,-1]]. Similarly, |1⟩⟨1| is (I - σ_z)/2.

So substituting back into ρ: 

ρ = (1/2)[ (I + σ_z)/2 + (I - σ_z)/2 ] 

Let me compute that. Inside the brackets: [ (I + σ_z + I - σ_z ) / 2 ]?

Wait, wait, no. Wait, the expression is (I + σ_z)/2 plus (I - σ_z)/2. Adding these together: (I + σ_z + I - σ_z)/2 = (2I)/2 = I. So ρ becomes (1/2)(I) = I/2.

Hmm, so ρ is I/2. That's a completely mixed state. The Bloch vector for a completely mixed state is zero, because in the Bloch sphere, I is the identity matrix, which corresponds to r being (0,0,0). 

So the Bloch vector r is (0,0,0). Looking at the options, option C is (0,0,0). So the answer should be option C.

To determine the geometrical position of the given density matrix 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2}\left(|0\rangle\langle 0| + |1\rangle\langle 1|\right),
\]

we analyze its representation in qubit space. For a single qubit, the Bloch sphere is used to visualize quantum states, where the Bloch vector \((r_x, r_y, r_z)\) corresponds to the state's position. The general form of a density matrix in terms of the Bloch vector is:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2}\left(I + \vec{r} \cdot \vec{\sigma}\right),
\]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix, \(\vec{\sigma}\) represents the Pauli matrices, and \(\vec{r}\) is the Bloch vector.

The given density matrix can be rewritten as:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2}\left(|0\rangle\langle 0| + |1\rangle\langle 1|\right).
\]

Using the identities \(|0\rangle\langle 0| = \frac{1}{2}(I + \sigma_z)\) and \(|1\rangle\langle 1| = \frac{1}{2}(I - \sigma_z)\), we substitute these into \(\rho\):

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{1}{2}(I + \sigma_z) + \frac{1}{2}(I - \sigma_z)\right).
\]

Simplifying:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{I + \sigma_z + I - \sigma_z}{2}\right) = \frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{2I}{2}\right) = \frac{I}{2}.
\]

This shows that \(\rho\) is the identity matrix scaled by \(1/2\), which corresponds to a completely mixed state. For a completely mixed state, the Bloch vector \(\vec{r}\) is \((0, 0, 0)\), as there are no directional components in the Bloch sphere.

Thus, the geometrical position of \(\rho\) in qubit space is \((0, 0, 0)\).
