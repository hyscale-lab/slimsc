Okay, so I have this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through. The question is asking for the maximum speed of the mass in a one-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator. The options are given, and I need to pick the correct one.

Alright, let's start by recalling what I know about harmonic oscillators. In classical mechanics, a harmonic oscillator is a system that experiences a restoring force proportional to its displacement. The force is given by Hooke's law, F = -kx. The potential energy is (1/2)kx², and the total mechanical energy is the sum of kinetic and potential.

In the non-relativistic case, the maximum speed occurs when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. So, the maximum speed v_max is sqrt(kA²/m), where A is the amplitude. That would be option C. But wait, the question is about the relativistic case, so I can't just use the classical formula.

Relativity comes into play when velocities approach the speed of light c. So, we need to use relativistic mechanics here. In special relativity, the kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv²; instead, it's (γ-1)mc², where γ is the Lorentz factor, 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So, the total energy of the oscillator would be the sum of its relativistic kinetic energy and potential energy. At maximum speed, the potential energy is at its maximum, which is (1/2)kA², right? So the total energy E is the sum of kinetic and potential at that point.

Wait, no. Wait, actually, in the harmonic oscillator, the potential energy is maximum when x is maximum (at amplitude A), and the kinetic energy is zero. But in the relativistic case, is that the same? Because in the non-relativistic case, yes, but in relativity, the energy isn't just kinetic and potential as simply as that.

Wait, maybe I should model this. Let's think of the oscillator as having total energy E, which is a combination of rest mass energy and kinetic energy plus potential.

Wait, no. The potential energy is (1/2)kx². So when x is maximum (x=A), the potential is (1/2)kA², and the kinetic energy is zero. But wait, in relativity, the kinetic energy is the total energy minus the rest energy. So in that case, when x=A, the kinetic energy is zero, so the total energy E is equal to the rest energy plus potential energy? Hmm, that doesn't make sense. Or maybe not.

Wait, in non-relativistic mechanics, the total energy is (1/2)mv² + (1/2)kx². At maximum x, the kinetic energy is zero, so E = (1/2)kA². At maximum speed, which occurs at x=0, the potential energy is zero, and E = (1/2)mv². So in that case, maximum speed is when all energy is kinetic.

But in the relativistic case, the situation is different. The kinetic energy is (γ-1)mc², and the potential is (1/2)kx². So the total energy E is (γ-1)mc² + (1/2)kx².

Wait, but in the case of oscillation, the total energy should be conserved. So the maximum potential energy (when x=A) is the same as the maximum kinetic energy (when x=0). So when x=A, the kinetic energy is zero, so E = (1/2)kA². But when x=0, all the energy is kinetic, so E = (γ-1)mc². Therefore, these two expressions should be equal.

So setting them equal: (1/2)kA² = (γ - 1) mc².

We can solve for γ. Let's write that.

γ = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Wait, because (1/2)kA² = (γ-1) mc² → (γ-1) = (k A²)/(2 m c²) → γ = 1 + [k A²/(2 m c²)].

But γ is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So,

1/sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Hmm, let's denote (k A²)/(2 m c²) as a variable to make it easier. Let me call it 'a' for a moment.

So, 1/sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)) = 1 + a.

But wait, a is (k A²)/(2 m c²). Let's keep that as it is for now.

So, 1/sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)) = 1 + a.

Let's solve for v.

First, take reciprocal on both sides.

sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)) = 1/(1 + a).

Square both sides:

1 - (v²/c²) = 1/(1 + a)^2.

So,

v²/c² = 1 - [1/(1 + a)^2].

Hmm, let's compute 1 - [1/(1+a)^2].

1 - [1/(1 + a)^2] = [ (1 + a)^2 - 1 ] / (1 + a)^2.

Compute numerator:

(1 + a)^2 = 1 + 2a + a². So subtract 1, we get 2a + a².

So,

v²/c² = (2a + a²)/(1 + a)^2.

Factor numerator: a(2 + a).

Denominator: (1 + a)^2.

So,

v² = c² * [ a(2 + a) ] / (1 + a)^2.

But a is (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Let me substitute that back.

v² = c² * [ (k A²/(2 m c²)) ( 2 + (k A²/(2 m c²)) ) ] / [ (1 + (k A²/(2 m c²)) )^2 ]

Hmm, that looks a bit messy, but let's try to simplify.

First, let's compute the numerator and denominator.

Numerator:

(k A²/(2 m c²)) * [2 + (k A²/(2 m c²)) ].

Denominator:

[1 + (k A²/(2 m c²))]^2.

Let me factor out 1/(2 m c²) from the terms inside the brackets.

Wait, perhaps we can let a = k A²/(2 m c²) as before. Then the expression for v² is:

v² = c² * [ a (2 + a) ] / (1 + a)^2.

Let me compute that:

v² = c² [ a (2 + a) ] / (1 + a)^2.

Expanding (2 + a):

v² = c² a (2 + a) / ( (1 + a)^2 )

Let me see if I can write this differently. Let's factor the numerator.

Wait, 2 + a = 2 + a = 1 +1 + a.

Hmm, maybe not helpful. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to factor the denominator.

(1 + a)^2 = 1 + 2a + a².

So,

v^2 = c^2 [a (2 + a)] / (1 + 2a + a^2)

Let me multiply a into the numerator terms:

= c^2 [ (2a + a^2) ) ] / (1 + 2a + a^2 )

Hmm, the denominator is the same as (a + 1)^2. The numerator is 2a + a² = a(a + 2).

Wait, perhaps not. Let me see if I can write the numerator and denominator as (a + 1 + something).

Alternatively, perhaps express the numerator as (a +1)(something) ?

Wait, 2a + a² = a(a + 2) = a (a + 2).

But the denominator is (a +1)^2.

Not sure if that helps. Alternatively, let's write both numerator and denominator in terms of a.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to take the square root for v.

v = c * sqrt( [ a (2+a) ] / (1 + a)^2 )

= c * sqrt( a (2 + a) ) / (1 +a )

Hmm, maybe factor something else.

Wait, perhaps expanding the numerator and see:

a (2 + a) = 2a + a².

So,

v^2 = c^2 (2a + a²) / (1 +a )^2.

Hmm, alternative approach: perhaps factor the denominator as (1+a)^2, and the numerator as a(2 +a) = a(a+2).

Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps factor numerator as a (a + 2) = a (a + 2).

Wait, perhaps I can write the numerator as a (a + 2) = a(a +1 +1) = a(a+1) + a.

But I'm not sure that helps.

Alternatively, perhaps I should express this in terms of (1 + a) to see if it simplifies.

Wait, another thought: perhaps in the limit where a is small, i.e., when k A^2/(2 m c²) is much less than 1, the expression reduces to the classical case.

In the non-relativistic limit, a = (k A^2)/(2 m c²) → 0 because c is very large. So, let's see what the expression becomes.

In that case,

v² ≈ c^2 [ a * 2 ] / (1)^2 → 2 a c² → 2 [k A²/(2 m c²)] c² → [k A²/m ].

Which is the non-relativistic result. That's good; it matches option C when a is small. So our expression must be correct.

But let's get back to the problem. The question is to find v_max in terms of the given options. The options have various forms with square roots and terms involving kA² and so on.

Looking at the options:

Option A: v_max = c * sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (kA²/(2m)) )^2 )

Wait, let's compute that denominator. Inside the square root, it's 1 + 1/(1 - (k A²/(2 m))^2 ). Hmm, that doesn't look familiar.

Option B: v_max = c * sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (k A²/(2 m c^2) )) )

Wait, but inside the square root, 1 + 1/(1 - x), where x = (k A²)/(2 m c²). Let me compute that:

1 + [1/(1 - x)] = [ (1 -x) +1 ]/(1 -x) )= (2 - x)/(1 -x).

So, sqrt( (2 - x)/(1 -x) ) → but I'm not sure if that matches our expression.

Option C is the non-relativistic case. So it's only correct when velocities are much smaller than c, but the question is about the relativistic case, so it's probably not the answer.

Option D: v_max = c*sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (k A²/(2 m c^2))^2 )).

Hmm, that's a negative inside the sqrt if the denominator is greater than 1, which would be problematic. Not sure.

Wait, let me write the expression I derived for v^2 again.

v^2 = c^2 * [ a (2 + a) ] / (1 + a)^2.

Where a = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2).

So,

v^2/c^2 = [ a (2 + a) ] / (1 + a)^2.

Let me compute this:

[ a (2 + a) ] / (1 + a)^2.

Hmm, perhaps I can factor this as [ a/(1+a) ) * (2 + a) ] / (1 +a).

Wait, alternatively, perhaps we can write this as:

[ a (2 + a) ] / (1 + 2a + a² ).

Hmm, perhaps this doesn't help much. Alternatively, perhaps let me factor the numerator and denominator:

Hmm, 2 + a = (1 + a) + 1.

So,

= [ a( (1 +a) + 1 ) ] / (1 +a)^2.

= [ a (1 +a) + a ] / (1 +a)^2.

= [ a (1 +a) ]/(1+a)^2 + a/(1 +a)^2.

= a/(1+a) + a/(1+a)^2.

Hmm, not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, perhaps factor the numerator:

a(2 +a) = a a + 2a = a² + 2a.

Denominator: (1 +a)^2 = 1 + 2a +a².

So,

= (a² + 2a) / (a² + 2a + 1).

Hmm, could also write denominator as (a +1)^2.

Wait, perhaps write it as:

= (a² + 2a +1 -1 ) / (a +1)^2.

= [ (a+1)^2 -1 ] / (a+1)^2.

= 1 - [1/(a+1)^2].

So,

v²/c² = [ a (2 +a) ] / (1 +a)^2 = 1 - [1/(1 + a)^2 ].

Wait, that's interesting. So,

v² = c² [1 - 1/(1 + a)^2 ].

Which can be written as,

v = c sqrt(1 - 1/(1+a)^2 ).

But wait, let's compute 1/(1+a)^2:

1/(1+a)^2 = 1/(1 + k A²/(2 m c^2) )^2.

So,

v = c * sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2) ))^2 )

Wait, that's option D.

Looking back at the options:

Option D says: v_max = c*sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2)) )^2 )

Yes, that's exactly what I have here.

Wait, but in our earlier steps, we had v squared equal to c squared multiplied by [ a (2 +a) ] / (1 +a)^2, and then we converted it into 1 - [1/(1+a)^2 ].

Wait, but earlier I thought I had v² = c² [ a (2 + a) ] / (1 +a)^2.

But now I've found that [ a (2 +a) ] / (1 +a)^2 = 1 - [1/(1+a)^2 ].

So,

v² = c² [ 1 - 1/(1 + a)^2 ]

→ v = c sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + a)^2 )

Which matches option D.

Wait, but looking at the options, option D is written as:

v_max = c*sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (kA^2/(2 m c^2)) )^2 )

Which is exactly what we have.

So the correct answer would be option D.

Wait, but let me double-check.

Let me compute 1 - 1/(1+a)^2.

Which is [ (1+a)^2 -1 ] / (1+a)^2.

Which is [ 1 + 2a + a² -1 ] / (1+a)^2 → (2a +a²)/(1+a)^2.

Which is a(2 +a)/(1+a)^2, which is exactly what we have.

So yes, v^2 is c^2 times that, so v is c times sqrt( [a(2 +a)] / (1+a)^2 ) ), which is sqrt(1 - 1/(1+a)^2 ) times c.

So option D is correct.

Wait, but looking again at the options, option D is written as:

D) v_max = c sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (kA^2/(2 m c^2)) )^2 )

Which is the same as our expression.

So the correct answer must be option D.

To determine the maximum speed \( v_{\text{max}} \) of a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator, we start by considering the total energy of the system. The total energy \( E \) is the sum of the relativistic kinetic energy and the potential energy. At maximum displacement \( x = A \), the potential energy is at its maximum, \( \frac{1}{2}kA^2 \), and the kinetic energy is zero. At maximum speed \( v_{\text{max}} \), the potential energy is zero, and all the energy is kinetic. Thus, the total energy is conserved, leading to the equation:

\[
\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = (\gamma - 1)mc^2,
\]

where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \) is the Lorentz factor. Solving for \( \gamma \), we find:

\[
\gamma = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}.
\]

Substituting \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \), we get:

\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}.
\]

Let \( a = \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \). Then:

\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = 1 + a.
\]

Taking the reciprocal and squaring both sides:

\[
\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2} = \frac{1}{1 + a},
\]

\[
1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2} = \frac{1}{(1 + a)^2}.
\]

Rearranging for \( v^2/c^2 \):

\[
\frac{v^2}{c^2} = 1 - \frac{1}{(1 + a)^2}.
\]

Substituting \( a = \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \), we find:

\[
\frac{v^2}{c^2} = 1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}.
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}}.
\]

This matches the form of option D. To confirm, we analyze the other options:

- **Option A**: The expression inside the square root does not match the derived result.
- **Option B**: The denominator inside the fraction is incorrect.
- **Option C**: This is the non-relativistic result, which does not account for relativistic effects.
- **Option D**: Matches the derived expression exactly.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: D**
