Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step.

The question says that Ay is represented by a 2x2 matrix and satisfies the eigenvalue equation Ay(φ) = a(φ). Oh right, so we're looking for eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay.

The operator Ay is given as c multiplied by S, where c is h/(4π) and S is a 2x2 matrix. The matrix S has first row (0, -i) and second row (i, 0). So I should probably write out S first to be clear.

So S is:
[ 0   -i ]
[ i    0 ]

And Ay = c * S, which would make it:
[ 0      c*(-i) ]
[ c*i    0 ]

Since c is h/(4π), let me plug that in. So substituting, Ay becomes:
[ 0      (-h/(4π)) * i ]
[ (h/(4π)) * i      0 ]

Wait, but that's the same as:
[ 0 , (-i h)/(4π) ]
[ (i h)/(4π), 0 ]

So now, to find the eigenvalues a of Ay, we need to solve the characteristic equation det(Ay - a I) = 0.

The determinant of the matrix (Ay - a I) is:
| (-a)      (-i h)/(4π)   |
| (i h)/(4π)   (-a)     |

So the determinant is (-a)(-a) - [ (-i h/(4π) ) * (i h/(4π)) ) ].

Calculating that: a² minus [ ( (-i)(i) ) * (h²)/(16 π²) ) ]

Wait, (-i)(i) is equal to what? Because i * i is -1, but here it's (-i)(i) = -i² = -(-1) = 1. So the product is positive.

So the term becomes [1 * (h²)/(16 π²) ) ] = h²/(16 π²).

So the determinant equation is a² - h²/(16 π²) = 0.

So solving for a: a² = h²/(16 π²) → a = ± h/(4 π) * (1/2) ? Wait, wait, wait. Let me compute that again.

Wait, h/(4π) is c. So a² = (h²)/(16 π²). Taking square roots, a = ± (h)/(4π) * (1/(2)) ?

Wait, no. Let me compute sqrt( h²/(16 π²) ). That's h/(4 π), because sqrt(16 is 4, and h squared is h, π squared is π). So a = ± h/(4 π) * 1?

Wait, wait no, wait. Let me compute the determinant again.

The determinant is:

(-a)(-a) - [ (-i h/(4π) ) * (i h/(4π) ) ]

Which is a² - [ ( ( -i )(i) ) * (h²)/(16 π²) ) ]

As I said before, (-i)(i) is 1, so the term is (h²)/(16 π²) * 1.

Thus, the equation is a² - (h²)/(16 π²) = 0 → a² = h²/(16 π²)

So a = ± h/(4 π) * (1/2) ?

Wait, no. Wait, sqrt( h²/(16 π²) ) is h/(4 π), right? Because 16 is 4², so sqrt(16 pi²) is 4 pi. So yes. So a = ± h/(4 pi) * (1/2) ??? No, wait:

Wait, sqrt( h²/(16 π²) ) = sqrt( (h/(4 π))² ) = h/(4 π) * 1, because sqrt(a²) is a. So a = ± h/(4 π).

Wait, that can't be right because the matrix S has eigenvalues ±1. Because S is a Pauli matrix, right? Oh wait, the Pauli matrices σ_x, σ_y, σ_z.

Wait, the matrix S here is exactly σ_y, the Pauli Y matrix. Because σ_y is:
[ 0  -i ]
[ i   0 ]

So yes, S is σ_y. And the eigenvalues of the Pauli matrices are ±1. Because the Pauli matrices are 2x2 Hermitian matrices with trace zero and determinant -1, so their eigenvalues are ±1.

So for Ay = c * S, the eigenvalues would just be c times the eigenvalues of S. So since S has eigenvalues 1 and -1, then Ay has eigenvalues c * 1 and c * (-1).

Given that c = h/(4 π), so eigenvalues a are h/(4 π) * 1 and h/(4 π) * (-1). So a = ± h/(4 π).

Wait, but looking at the options, option A says that the imaginary part of the eigenvalue are ±2π h, and the real parts are ±h/(4π). Hmm, that's not matching because Ay's eigenvalues are real. Because Pauli matrices are Hermitian, so their linear combinations with real coefficients are Hermitian, so eigenvalues are real.

So the eigenvalues of Ay should be real numbers: a = h/(4 π) and a = -h/(4 π).

Wait, but looking at the options, options A and B have complex eigenvalues. Wait, that can't be right because Ay is a Hermitian operator (since c is real and S is Hermitian). Because S is Hermitian: S equals its conjugate transpose. Let's check S.

S is:
0  -i
i   0

The conjugate transpose would be:
0   i
-i   0

Which is S itself, so yes, S is Hermitian. Then Ay = c S is also Hermitian (c is real). So eigenvalues are real. So any option that suggests complex eigenvalues is incorrect.

Looking at the options:

Option A: eigenvalues have imaginary parts ±2πh and real parts ±h/(4π). That's impossible because the eigenvalues are real.

Option B: eigenvalues have imaginary parts ±1/2 and real parts ±1. Again, eigenvalues are real, so this can't be correct.

Option C: Eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. Hmm, since A is the angular momentum operator, the square of A would have the same eigenfunctions as any component of A, because A² is a scalar operator in angular momentum space. So if φ is an eigenfunction of Ay, it's also an eigenfunction of A². But whether it's an eigenfunction of Az depends on whether it's a simultaneous eigenstate. For angular momentum, in general, you can have simultaneous eigenstates of A² and one component, say Az, but not two different components like Ay and Az. So if φ is an eigenfunction of Ay, it's not an eigenfunction of Az. So option C says that φ can be an eigenfunction of A² but not of Az. So that's correct. Because A² commutes with Ay. So if φ is an eigenfunction of Ay, it must be an eigenfunction of A² as well. So option C is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. Hmm, the basis functions would be the eigenvectors of Ay. So since Ay is a matrix, its eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) form the basis for the vector space. So yes, the eigenvectors are the basis functions of the operator. So option D seems correct.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused about option D. The statement says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of Ay. Well, the eigenvectors of a matrix form a basis for the space, so that seems correct. So options C and D could be correct.

Wait, but let's go back to the question. The question asks which statement is correct during the calculation.

So, let me reevaluate the options.

Wait, the eigenvalues are ± h/(4π), which are real. So looking at the options, only option C and D are possible correct statements.

Option C says that the eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. As I thought earlier, this is correct. Because A² is diagonal in the same basis as any component, so yes. So any eigenfunction of Ay is also an eigenfunction of A². But it can't be an eigenfunction of both Ay and Az because of the commutator [Ay, Az] which is non-zero, so they don't share eigenfunctions.

So option C is correct.

Option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of Ay's operator. Since the operator is 2x2, the eigenvectors (eigenfunctions) form a basis for the space (which is 2-dimensional), so the eigenfunctions are indeed the basis functions. So option D is also correct.

Wait, but the question is which statement is correct during the calculation. So both C and D could be correct? Hmm.

Wait, let me think again. Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above. Well, the eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) form a basis for the vector space (which is two-dimensional), so yes, they are the basis functions of the operator. So D is correct.

So which of the options is correct? The question is which is correct. Both C and D seem correct, but let's look at the options again.

Wait, the options are A, B, C, D.

But going back to the question statement: the operator Ay is expressed as c times S, and S is given.

Wait, the matrix S is the Pauli Y matrix, which is Hermitian, so Ay is Hermitian, so the eigenvalues are real. So in the options, only options C and D are possible.

But looking at the options, option C says that the eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A squared, but not of Az.

Option D says that the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator.

So both C and D are correct statements about the operator. But looking at the options again, let me see.

Wait, the question says which statement is correct during the calculation.

Wait, in the calculation, what do we do? We find eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

Option D is a statement about the basis, which is true because the eigenvectors form a basis.

So perhaps both C and D are correct, but let me check the options again.

Wait, the options are:

C) The eigenfunction of the operator Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A^2, but not of the Z-component, Az.

D) The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.

Hmm, so both C and D are correct statements. But wait, looking at the problem again, the possible answers are only one of A, B, C, D.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the eigenvalues. Let me compute the eigenvalues again.

Wait, the matrix Ay is c * S. S is σ_y, which has eigenvalues ±1.

So Ay's eigenvalues are c * 1 and c * (-1). Since c is h/(4 π), the eigenvalues are ± h/(4 π). So they're real.

So looking back, which option says that the eigenvalues are purely real? Let's see the options:

Option A: Eigenvalues have imaginary parts ±2πh and real parts ± h/(4 π). No, eigenvalues are real, so this is wrong.

Option B: Eigenvalues have imaginary parts ±1/2 and real parts ±1. Again, eigenvalues are real, so this is wrong.

Option C: Doesn't mention eigenvalues, so correct.

Option D: Correct.

Wait, but the question is about which statement is correct during the calculation. So both C and D could be correct. But looking at the options, perhaps only one is correct.

Wait, the question says which statement is correct. Let me reevaluate each option.

Option C: The eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A². That's correct because A² is a scalar operator. So any eigenfunction of Ay is also an eigenfunction of A². But they cannot be eigenfunctions of Az as well, since Ay and Az don't commute. So option C is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. That's correct because the eigenvectors form a basis for the vector space. So D is correct.

Wait, but wait, is the D statement always true? The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the operator. Well, the operator is 2x2, and the eigenvectors form a basis for the space, which is the same as the basis for the operator. So yes, that's correct.

Hmm, so both options C and D are correct statements. But that can't be, as only one option can be correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in analyzing option C. Let me think again. If A is the total angular momentum, then A² and Ay commute. So any eigenstate of Ay is also an eigenstate of A². So option C is correct.

But if the question's options don't have both C and D as correct, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me look at the options again.

Wait, the options are:

C) The eigenfunction of Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A², but not of Az.

D) The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of Ay.

So both are correct. But in the multiple-choice scenario, perhaps only one is correct.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something else. Let's think about the eigenvectors. For a 2x2 matrix, the eigenvectors are two-dimensional vectors. So the eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) form a basis for the space, so D is correct.

So perhaps both C and D are correct, but looking at the options, only one can be the correct answer. Alternatively, perhaps only one is correct.

Wait, let me think about the options again. The question is which statement is correct.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is option D, because the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the operator. But wait, in quantum mechanics, the eigenvectors of an operator form an orthonormal basis if they're from different eigenvalues, but perhaps the statement in D is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps option C is correct because it's talking about another property. Let me think.

Wait, the problem is asking which statement will you consider to be correct during the calculation, which suggests that it's about the process of finding eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

Option D is a general property of linear operators. The eigenvectors (eigenfunctions) form a basis for the space, so D is correct.

Option C is also correct because the eigenfunctions of Ay are also eigenfunctions of A².

So if both C and D are correct, but only one of the options is correct, perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the correct option in the given choices.

Let me check again the possible options.

Eigenvalue calculation: a = ± h/(4π). So eigenvalues are real.

So looking at the options, options A and B have complex eigenvalues, which are not correct. So only C and D are left.

So the correct statements must be either C or D.

But the question is which statement is correct during the calculation.

Wait, the question is about the process of finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors. So perhaps the correct answer is option D, which states that the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the operator. Because when you diagonalize a matrix, the eigenvectors form the basis.

Wait, but the statement in option D is a bit ambiguous. The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the operator. It might mean that the matrix is diagonal in the eigenbasis, which is correct.

But looking back, the question is which statement is correct during the calculation. So perhaps D is correct.

Alternatively, option C is correct because when solving for eigenvalues, you find that the eigenfunctions are also eigenfunctions of A².

Wait, but when you're calculating the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay, you find the eigenvectors. So perhaps during that calculation, you implicitly use that they form a basis, which is statement D.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is option D, but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, but the question says which statement is correct. Let me think again about each option.

Option C: "The eigenfunction of the operator Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A^2, but not of the Z-component, Az."

Yes, because A² and Ay commute, so their eigenfunctions are the same. But Ay and Az don't commute, so their eigenfunctions are different.

So C is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. Well, since the matrix is 2x2, its eigenvectors form a basis. So D is correct.

So both C and D are correct statements.

But looking back at the options, perhaps the correct answer is C.

Wait, but in the given options, only one can be correct. Let me recheck which one is correct.

Wait, the problem is about the muon's intrinsic angular momentum. The operator A is the angular momentum operator, and the components like Ay and Az are involved.

In quantum mechanics, the square of the angular momentum A² and any component (e.g., Az) commute with each other. So if you have an eigenstate of Ay, it's also an eigenstate of A². But it is not an eigenstate of Az unless it's a simultaneous eigenstate, which isn't possible unless you're in a basis that's a product of A² and Az eigenstates.

So option C is correct because the eigenfunctions of Ay are also eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az.

Option D is correct because the eigenfunctions form a basis for the operator.

So both C and D seem correct. But the options provided only have one correct answer. So perhaps I made a mistake. Alternatively, maybe only one of them is correct.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the process of calculation, so which statement is correct during the calculation.

If during the calculation of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors, you find that the eigenfunctions form a basis (option D), that's correct. But perhaps the key point is that the eigenfunctions are the basis functions, which is a given property. So perhaps D is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is C.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck. Let me think of another approach. Maybe compute the eigenvectors and see which option aligns.

The eigenvalues are ±h/(4π).

For Ay, the matrix is:

[ 0        (-i h)/(4π) ]
[ (i h)/(4π) 0 ]

So for a = h/(4π), the eigenvalue equation is:

[ 0        (-i h)/(4π) ] [ φ1 ]   =  [ h/(4π) ] [φ1]
[ (i h)/(4π) 0 ]       [ φ2 ]     [ ] [φ2]

Which gives the equations:

0 * φ1 + (-i h/(4π)) φ2 = (h/(4π)) φ1 → (-i h/(4π)) φ2 = (h/(4π)) φ1 → -i φ2 = φ1.

Similarly, the second equation: (i h/(4π)) φ1 + 0 * φ2 = (h/(4π)) φ2 → i φ1 = φ2.

So from the first equation, φ1 = -i φ2. Substituting into the second equation: i*(-i φ2) = φ2 → (i * -i) φ2 = φ2 → (1) φ2 = φ2. Which holds. So the eigenvectors are of the form φ1 = -i φ2. So choosing φ2 = 1, φ1 = -i. So the eigenvector is [ -i, 1 ]^T.

Similarly, for a = -h/(4π), the equations would be:

0 * φ1 + (-i h/(4π)) φ2 = (-h/(4π)) φ1 → (-i h/(4π)) φ2 = (-h/(4π)) φ1 → -i φ2 = -φ1 → φ1 = i φ2.

Second equation: (i h/(4π)) φ1 + 0 = (-h/(4π)) φ2 → i φ1 = -φ2.

Substituting φ1 = i φ2 into this: i*(i φ2) = -φ2 → (i^2) φ2 = -φ2 → (-1) φ2 = -φ2 → which holds. So the eigenvector is [ i, 1 ]^T.

So the eigenvectors are [ -i, 1 ] and [ i, 1 ].

These are the basis functions for the operator Ay.

So option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. So yes, that's correct.

So both C and D seem correct, but the options are given as single choice, so perhaps I need to look again.

Wait, looking at the options:

Option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of Ay. So that's correct because the eigenvectors form a basis for the operator's space.

Option C says the eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A², which is correct.

So both are correct.

But the question is, which statement is correct during the calculation. Hmm, perhaps the point is that the eigenfunctions are the basis functions, so statement D is correct.

Wait, but in a 2x2 matrix, the eigenvectors are the basis functions, so D is correct.

So given the options, I think the correct answer is D.

Wait, but earlier I thought C was correct. Let me think again.

Wait, the problem is about the intrinsic angular momentum operator, which is spin-1/2. So the square of the spin S² has eigenvalues s(s+1)ħ², where s=1/2. So A is the intrinsic angular momentum, which is ħ times the spin operator.

Wait, assuming A is the spin operator scaled by ħ. So A² would have eigenvalue (1/2)(1/2 +1) ħ² = (3/4) ħ².

But in this problem, Ay is given as c S, with c = h/(4 π). So S is the Pauli matrices, which have eigenvalues ±1. So Ay's eigenvalues are ± c.

But in the context of the spin-1/2 system, the eigenfunctions of Ay would be the same as the eigenfunctions of S_y, which are the same as the eigenfunctions of A². So option C is correct.

But since the question is about which statement is correct, and both C and D seem correct, but the options don't allow that, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps option D is not correct. Because the eigenfunctions are not the basis functions of Ay. Wait, the basis functions of the operator would be the functions that the operator acts on. But in this case, the operator is a 2x2 matrix, so the basis is any orthonormal basis, not necessarily the eigenvectors.

Wait, no, the statement in D is that the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. That's correct because the eigenvectors form a basis for the space, which is the same space the operator acts on.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is D.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about another approach.

The question asks which statement is correct during the calculation of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

Option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of Ay. That would be correct because when you diagonalize a matrix, the eigenvectors form a basis.

So perhaps the correct answer is D.

But earlier, I thought option C is correct.

Wait, the problem says the eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az. That's correct because A² commutes with Ay, so they share eigenfunctions.

So both options C and D are correct.

But looking at the options, perhaps only one is correct, and I need to choose between them.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C.

Wait, but the problem is a multiple-choice question, and the options are four. Since I'm a bit stuck, perhaps I should think again. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is D.

Wait, but looking back, the problem says which statement is correct during the calculation. So perhaps the correct answer is D because when you find the eigenfunctions, you use them as the basis.

So after this lengthy thought process, I think the correct answer is D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves calculating the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator \( A_y \), which is given as \( A_y = c \cdot S \), where \( c = \frac{h}{4\pi} \) and \( S \) is the Pauli \( Y \)-matrix:

\[
S = 
\begin{bmatrix}
0 & -i \\
i & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Key Analysis:

1. **Eigenvalues of \( A_y \):**
   - The matrix \( S \) is the Pauli \( Y \)-matrix, which is Hermitian and has eigenvalues \( \pm 1 \).
   - Since \( A_y = c \cdot S \), the eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are \( \pm c \), where \( c = \frac{h}{4\pi} \). Thus, the eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \), which are real.

2. **Eigenfunctions of \( A_y \):**
   - Solving the eigenvalue equation \( A_y \phi = a \phi \), the eigenvectors are found to be:
     \[
     \phi_1 = \begin{bmatrix} -i \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}, \quad \phi_2 = \begin{bmatrix} i \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}.
     \]
   - These eigenvectors form a basis for the 2-dimensional vector space, meaning the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are indeed the basis functions of the operator.

3. **Option Analysis:**
   - **Option A:** Incorrect. The eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are real (\( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \)), not complex.
   - **Option B:** Incorrect. The eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are real and equal to \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \), not \( \pm 1 \) or \( \pm \frac{1}{2} \).
   - **Option C:** Correct. The eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are also eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \) because \( A^2 \) commutes with \( A_y \). However, they are not eigenfunctions of \( A_z \) because \( A_y \) and \( A_z \) do not commute.
   - **Option D:** Correct. The eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) form a basis for the 2-dimensional vector space, which is the same space in which \( A_y \) operates.

4. **Final Decision:**
   - Both options C and D are correct. However, since the question asks for the correct statement during the calculation, the focus is on the process of diagonalizing \( A_y \). The eigenfunctions forming a basis for the operator is a fundamental property that is directly relevant to the calculation.

ANSWER: D
