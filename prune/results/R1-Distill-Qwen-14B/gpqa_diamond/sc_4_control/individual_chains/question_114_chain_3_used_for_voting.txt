Okay, let's try to figure out this chemistry problem. So, the question is about selecting the correct reagents for two reactions. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my organic chemistry, but let me think this through.

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to give 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. I remember that when ketones react with nitriles, it's usually some kind of addition reaction. Oh wait, maybe it's the formation of a cyanohydrin. Right, that's when a ketone or aldehyde reacts with a cyanide ion. So the reaction is adding CN- across the carbonyl group.

But wait, the conditions for that. I think the cyanide ion is a good nucleophile, but in what solvent? I remember that sometimes you need an acid catalyst for such reactions. Oh yeah, the formation of cyanohydrin typically uses an acid like H3O+ as a catalyst. Because the acid would protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making it more electrophilic, so the CN- can attack.

So for the first reaction, reagent A is probably H3O+. Let me check the options. Looking at the options, both A and B have A as H3O+ (option A: A=H3O+, B=HCl; option B: A=H3O+, B=CH3COOH). But wait, let's hold on a second. Another possibility: maybe it's a different reagent. Oh, wait, I also recall that sometimes NaHSO3 is used in such reactions, but that's more for other types of additions, like with sulfonic acid groups maybe? Or maybe in the formation of bisulfite adducts. Hmm, but I'm pretty sure the cyanohydrin formation uses an acid catalyst, like H3O+.

So reagent A is H3O+. So I can eliminate options C and D, because they have A as NaHSO3. That leaves options A and B.

Now onto the second reaction. The starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile, and it's reacting with reagent B (in H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. So looking at the structure, the nitrile group (CN) is being converted into a carboxylic acid (COOH).

How does a nitrile become a carboxylic acid? I remember that nitriles can be hydrolyzed under certain conditions. The typical hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids requires specific reagents and conditions. Let me think: if you have a nitrile and you want to make a carboxylic acid, you usually need strong acidic or basic conditions, and often heat or a catalyst.

Wait, there's another approach. Nitriles can be hydrolyzed to amides first, then further hydrolyzed to acids. Alternatively, under acidic conditions, nitriles can undergo hydrolysis. Let me recall the reagents. For acidic hydrolysis, HCl (concentrated) and heat might be used. Or maybe using H2O with an acid catalyst.

Wait, in the second reaction, the reagent B is used along with H2O. So the setup is adding H2O and reagent B to the nitrile group to get the acid. So what's reagent B here?

Looking at the options, reagent B in option A is HCl, and in option B it's CH3COOH (acetic acid). So which one would work?

Nitrile to carboxylic acid hydrolysis can be done in acidic conditions. I think concentrated HCl with heat is a common method. Alternatively, in a basic solution, you might get an amide or a different product. But the product here is a carboxylic acid, so the reaction is likely acidic.

Wait, but another possibility is using a strong acid in the presence of water. So if B is HCl, then it's providing the acidic environment. Alternatively, if B is acetic acid, it's a weaker acid, but maybe sufficient.

Wait, let me think about the mechanism. The hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids involves the attack of water on the nitrile, but I think it's usually done under strongly acidic or basic conditions. For example, H2SO4 with heat, or using HCl. Acetic acid might not be strong enough, but perhaps in this case, considering the presence of the hydroxyl group in the molecule, the reaction might be different.

Wait, but the starting material already has a hydroxyl group in the same carbon as the nitrile. Like, the structure is 2-hydroxybutanenitrile, so the CN is on the same carbon as the OH. So when the CN is converted to COOH, that would make it a geminal diol? Wait, no, because the nitrile has R-C≡N, and upon hydrolysis, becomes R-COOH.

Wait, but let me think about the conditions. For the nitrile to carboxylic acid, common conditions are using HCl and water under reflux. So reagent B would be HCl in this case. So option A has B as HCl.

Alternatively, I remember that sometimes using a sodium hypochlorite or other oxidizing agents can convert nitriles to acids, but in this case, it's a hydrolysis, so probably acid or base.

Wait, I think in the presence of strong acid and heat, nitriles hydrolyze to carboxylic acids. So if reagent B is HCl, then the reaction would proceed. So the correct option would have B as HCl, which is option A.

But wait, why is option B an option? Because in option B, reagent B is acetic acid. Would that be enough? Acetic acid is a weak acid. For nitrile hydrolysis, I think you need a strong acid. So perhaps option A is correct.

So putting it all together: first reaction uses H3O+ as A, and second uses HCl as B. So the correct option is option A.

The first reaction involves the formation of a cyanohydrin from butan-2-one and NaCN. This reaction typically requires an acid catalyst to protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making it more electrophilic for the nucleophilic attack by CN⁻. Among the options, H₃O⁺ is the most suitable acid catalyst for this reaction, eliminating options C and D, which use NaHSO₃ as reagent A.

The second reaction involves the hydrolysis of a nitrile group to a carboxylic acid. This requires strong acidic conditions, as nitriles are not easily hydrolyzed under weak acidic conditions. Concentrated HCl provides the necessary acidic environment for this transformation, making it the appropriate choice for reagent B. Option B, which uses CH₃COOH (acetic acid), is insufficient for this reaction due to its weak acidity.

Thus, the correct reagents are A = H₃O⁺ and B = HCl, corresponding to option A.

Answer: A
