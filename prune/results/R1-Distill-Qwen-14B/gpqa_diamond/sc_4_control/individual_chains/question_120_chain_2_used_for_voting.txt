Okay, so I have this question about stars being uniformly distributed in the sky and how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, parallax is something related to distance, right? Oh wait, parallax is inversely proportional to distance. So the closer a star is, the larger its parallax.

Wait, the question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. So if I have a certain range of parallax, say from plx to plx + dplx, how does the number of stars in that range change with plx.

I remember that the number of stars in a certain volume depends on the volume. Because if stars are uniformly distributed, more volume means more stars. So the number density is uniform, meaning n = number of stars per volume.

But how does the volume relate to parallax? Parallax plx is given by plx = 1/d, where d is the distance. Wait, no, more accurately, parallax (in arcseconds) is equal to 1 divided by the distance in parsecs. So plx (") = 1/d (pc). So d = 1/plx.

So if we have a range of parallaxes, say from plx to plx + dplx, what does that mean for the distances? The distances would be from d = 1/plx to d = 1/(plx + dplx). But wait, that's a small change, so maybe it's easier to think in terms of shells or thin layers between d and d + dd.

Wait, no, maybe I should think about a differential approach. Let's consider a thin shell between distance d and d + dd. The volume of this shell is approximately 4πd² dd. Because the volume of a sphere is (4/3)πr³, so the derivative with respect to r is 4πr² dr, which is the volume of the thin shell.

So the number of stars in this shell would be n * 4πd² dd, where n is the number density (stars per unit volume). Since n is uniform, that's straightforward.

But the question is about the number per unit parallax, not distance. So we need to express this in terms of parallax plx.

Since plx is 1/d, then d = 1/plx. So let's substitute d in terms of plx.

So d = 1/plx, so dd = - (1/(plx)^2) dplx. Wait, the negative sign indicates that as plx increases, d decreases. But since we are dealing with ranges, maybe we can take the absolute value.

So substituting, the volume shell in terms of plx would be 4π (1/plx)^2 * ( - dplx/(1/plx^2) ) )

Wait, maybe I should approach it differently. Let's see:

We have the number of stars in a shell at distance d with thickness dd is N = n * 4π d² dd.

But we want to express this in terms of a parallax change dplx. So d = 1/plx. So when plx changes by dplx, d changes by dd = - d (dplx)/ (plx)^2. Because d = 1/plx, so dd = - (1/plx²) dplx.

So the number of stars in a parallax range plx to plx + dplx is N = n * 4π (1/plx)^2 * |dd|.

Substituting dd from above, |dd|= (1/plx²) dplx. So N = n * 4π (1/plx)^2 * (dplx / plx²) ) = n *4π (dplx) / plx^4.

Wait, that gives N proportional to (1/plx^4) times dplx. So the number per unit parallax range (dplx) is N/dplx = 4 π n / plx^4. So the number of stars per unit range of plx (dplx) is proportional to 1/plx^4.

Wait, but the options given are the scaling of the number per unit plx. So if you have a unit change in plx, how does the number change.

Let me think again. The number of stars in a thin parallax shell between plx and plx + dplx is N = n * 4 π (1/plx)^2 (d d), where d d is the change in distance. But d d = - (d (dplx)) / plx². Hmm, perhaps a better approach is to express everything in terms of plx.

Alternatively, think of the volume between plx and plx + dplx. The corresponding distances are d = 1/plx and d + dd = 1/(plx + dplx). Wait, that's a bit messy. Maybe using calculus.

The number of stars in a range of parallax [plx, plx + dplx]. First, express the volume in terms of d.

The volume between d and d + dd is 4π d² dd, where dd = d (d d). Wait, no, dd is the change in d. So d d is the change in d when plx changes by dplx. Since plx = 1/d, d = 1/plx. So dd = - (d (dplx)/ (plx)^2) ) = - ( (1/plx) * dplx ) / (1/plx)^2 ) ) = - (dplx * plx^2) )

Wait, perhaps another approach.

Let me define the volume between two distances d1 and d2 as V = (4/3) π (d2³ - d1³). But since we're considering a thin shell, V ≈ 4 π d² (d2 - d1) = 4 π d² dd, where dd = d2 - d1.

Now, d is 1/plx, so dd = d2 - d1 = (1/plx2) - (1/plx1). If plx changes by dplx, then d changes by dd = (1/(plx + dplx)) - (1/plx) )

But for small dplx, this can be approximated. Let me see, using differentials. Let me think of d as a function of plx: d = 1/plx. So dd = - (1/plx²) dplx.

So, the volume V ≈ 4 π ( (1/plx)^2 ) ( - dplx / (plx^2) ) )

Wait, that seems a bit confusing. Let's do it again more carefully.

Given plx = 1/d, so d = 1/plx.

The volume of a shell between d and d + dd is 4 π d² dd.

We want to express this in terms of plx. So, we know that when plx increases by dplx, d decreases by dd = - (d (dplx) ) / (plx)^2.

Wait, that's because if plx increases by dplx, d = 1/(plx + dplx) ≈ (1/plx) (1 - dplx/(plx)) ) when dplx is small. So d ≈ (1/plx) - (dplx)/(plx²). Therefore, dd ≈ - dplx / plx².

So, substituting into the volume expression:

V = 4 π d² dd = 4 π (1/plx)^2 * (-dplx/(plx^2)) )

But since we're considering a small range, the negative sign indicates the direction, but since we're considering the magnitude, we can take the absolute value.

So V ≈ 4 π (1/plx²) * (dplx / plx² ) ) = 4 π dplx / plx^4.

So the volume in terms of parallax is proportional to 1/plx^4 multiplied by dplx.

But the number of stars is the number density n multiplied by the volume. So N = n * V = n * 4 π dplx / plx^4.

Wait, but the question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax (dplx). So, if you have a unit change in dplx, how does N change?

Wait, the number per unit dplx would be N = n * 4 π / plx^4, because N = n * 4 π dplx / plx^4, so for each dplx = 1 (unit), it's 4 π n / plx^4.

So the number of stars per unit parallax (dplx) is proportional to 1/plx^4.

Looking at the options, option A is ~1/plx^4. So the answer should be A.

Wait another thought: wait, the question says the number of stars per unit range of plx changes with plx. So as plx increases (meaning stars are farther away), the number of stars per unit plx (dplx) decreases as 1/plx^4.

But let's think about it in another way. Suppose you have a certain volume per unit parallax.

Another approach: the number of stars in a thin shell with radius d is n * 4 π d² dd. Since d = 1/plx, plx = 1/d. So d = 1/plx, so d² = 1/plx², and dd = - (d dplx) / (plx)^2 = - (1/plx) dplx / (1/plx)^2 ) = - dplx * plx.

Wait, wait no, let me compute dd correctly. Since plx = 1/d, then d = 1/plx.

Differentiating both sides, dd = - (1/plx² ) dplx.

So, substituting into the volume:

V = 4 π d² dd = 4 π (1/plx^2) * (-dplx / plx^2 ) )

So V = -4 π dplx / plx^4.

The negative sign indicates that as plx increases, d decreases. But since we're talking about the volume (positive), we take the absolute value, so V = 4 π dplx / plx^4.

Then the number of stars is N = n * V = n * 4 π dplx / plx^4.

So N is proportional to dplx / plx^4.

Thus, N per unit dplx is proportional to 1/plx^4.

Therefore, the number of stars per unit range of parallax (dplx) is proportional to 1/plx^4. So the correct option is A.

To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we start by noting that parallax is inversely proportional to distance: \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \), where \( d \) is the distance in parsecs. For a thin shell of stars at distance \( d \), the volume is \( 4 \pi d^2 dd \), where \( dd \) is the thickness of the shell. The number of stars in this shell is proportional to the volume, \( N = n \cdot 4 \pi d^2 dd \), where \( n \) is the number density of stars.

Since \( d = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \), we can express \( dd \) in terms of parallax. Differentiating \( d = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \), we find \( dd = -\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d\text{plx} \). Substituting \( d = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \) and \( dd = -\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d\text{plx} \) into the volume expression, the volume becomes:

\[
V = 4 \pi \left(\frac{1}{\text{plx}}\right)^2 \left(-\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d\text{plx}\right) = -\frac{4 \pi d\text{plx}}{\text{plx}^4}.
\]

Taking the absolute value (since volume is positive), we have \( V = \frac{4 \pi d\text{plx}}{\text{plx}^4} \). The number of stars in this volume is then \( N = n \cdot V = n \cdot \frac{4 \pi d\text{plx}}{\text{plx}^4} \). Dividing by \( d\text{plx} \) to find the number of stars per unit range of parallax, we get:

\[
\frac{N}{d\text{plx}} = \frac{n \cdot 4 \pi}{\text{plx}^4}.
\]

This shows that the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} \). Among the given options, this corresponds to:

**A) ~ \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} \)**.
