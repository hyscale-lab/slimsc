Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Let me read it again.

Alright, Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. And its mass is also 1.5 times larger. Interesting, but wait, how does mass relate to luminosity? I'm a bit fuzzy on that. Oh, right, for main-sequence stars, luminosity is related to mass. But wait, I think the formula is L ∝ M^3 or something like that for stars on the main sequence. But does that apply here? Hmm. Alternatively, maybe I should approach this using the black body radiation formula.

The question says that the astronomers found the wavelengths where the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, right! The peak wavelength of a star's emission is given by Wien's Law. Wien's Law is λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant and T is the temperature. So if both stars have the same λ_max, their temperatures must be the same. So T1 = T2.

So, both stars have the same temperature. Now, the luminosity of a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR²σT⁴. Here, R is radius, T is temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. Since both stars have the same T, and we're comparing L1 and L2, the ratio would be (R1²/R2²) multiplied by (something else? No, because T is same, so T⁴ cancels out in the ratio.)

So R1 is 1.5 R2. So R1² is (1.5)^2 = 2.25 times R2². So L1 should be 2.25 times L2. But wait, the options have A) ~2.25, D) ~2.23, etc. But wait, hold on. The problem mentions radial velocities. Oh, right, radial velocity is the Doppler shift, which affects the observed wavelength. Does that affect the calculation?

Wait, the problem states that the star's wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. So their observed λ_max is the same. But Doppler shift would affect the observed temperature. Because if a star is moving towards or away from us, its light is blueshifted or redshifted, which changes the observed wavelength. So the actual temperature might be different from what's inferred.

Wait, wait. Let me think. The observed wavelength is λ_observed = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + v_r) / (1 - v_r) ) ) or something like that, using relativistic Doppler shift. But maybe the problem assumes that the radial velocity is non-relativistic, so v_r is small compared to c, so we can approximate it as λ_observed ≈ λ_rest (1 + v_r / c). But wait, the problem says that the observed λ where they are brightest is the same. So for Star_1, radial velocity is zero, so its λ_max is the same as its rest frame. Star_2 has a velocity of 700 km/s. Wait, but wait, if Star_2 is moving towards us, that would blueshift its emission, making the observed λ shorter. Or is it moving away?

Wait, the problem says radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2. Wait, but radial velocity can be positive or negative depending on direction. Oh, but the problem doesn't specify the direction, just gives the velocities. So let's think about this.

Suppose Star_1 is at rest (v_r = 0), so the observed λ_max is the same as its actual λ_max. For Star_2, which has v_r = 700 km/s, but we don't know the direction. If it's moving away from us, the observed λ would be longer (redshifted). If it's moving towards us, it's shorter (blueshifted). But the problem states that the observed λ_max for both stars is the same. So since Star_1 is at rest, its observed λ_max is its real λ_max. Star_2, which is moving, must have an observed λ_max equal to that of Star_1.

Wait, but wait. The actual λ_max of Star_2 is different from Star_1 because their temperatures are different. But wait, earlier we thought T1 = T2 because λ_max (observed) is the same. However, if Star_2 is moving, its observed λ_max is not the same as its actual λ_max. So the observed λ_max for both stars is same, but their actual λ_max could be different because of their velocities.

So first, let's model this. Let's denote:

For Star_1:
v1 = 0 km/s
λ1_observed = λ1_rest = b / T1

For Star_2:
v2 = 700 km/s
λ2_observed = λ2_rest * sqrt( (1 + v2/c)/(1 - v2/c) ) ) [relativistic Doppler shift formula]

But wait, Doppler shift formula for wavelength is λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ) when moving away, or is it the reciprocal? Wait, no, if the star is moving away, the wavelength is redshifted, so λ_obs > λ_rest. So for v positive when moving away, the formula would be λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ). For v negative (moving towards us), it's blueshifted, so λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) ).

But wait, the problem says that Star_2's radial velocity is 700 km/s. The problem doesn't specify direction, so perhaps we have to account for that, but it's unclear. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the observed wavelengths are the same, so λ1_obs = λ2_obs. 

Wait, but the problem states that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. So λ1_obs = λ2_obs. 

So, for Star_1, since v1=0, λ1_obs = λ1_rest = b / T1.

For Star_2, λ2_obs = Doppler shifted version of λ2_rest. And λ2_rest = b / T2.

So, λ2_obs = λ2_rest * Doppler shift factor.

We have λ1_obs = λ2_obs.

So, 

b / T1 = (b / T2) * D,

where D is the Doppler shift factor.

So, 1/(T1) = (1/T2) * D.

So, T2 = T1 * D.

Wait, but what is D? D is the Doppler factor. Let me think about the Doppler shift formula again. The formula for emission lines is λ_obs = λ_emit * ( (1 + v_r) / sqrt(1 - v_r²/c²) ) ) when moving at velocity v_r. Or wait, another approximation could be used if v is small compared to c.

Wait, perhaps I should use the non-relativistic Doppler shift formula, which is approximately λ_obs ≈ λ_rest (1 + v_r / c ), where v_r is the radial velocity (positive if moving away, negative if moving towards). But wait, that formula is for small velocities where v << c. Let's check the velocity: 700 km/s. The speed of light is about 3e5 km/s, so 700 is about 0.23% of c. So maybe the non-relativistic approximation is acceptable.

But let me be precise. The relativistic Doppler shift formula for wavelength when the source is moving away (v positive) is:

λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) ) )

But if the source is moving towards us, v is negative, so it's sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

Wait, but in this problem, the radial velocities are given as 0 and 700 km/s. It doesn't specify direction, but the Doppler shift depends on whether the star is moving towards or away from us.

Wait, but without knowing the direction, how can we proceed? Hmm, perhaps the problem assumes that the 700 km/s is the radial velocity towards us. But without that info, perhaps I might have made a wrong assumption earlier.

Wait, but the problem states that the observed wavelengths are same. So let's write the equations.

So, for Star_2, if it's moving with velocity v (700 km/s), the observed wavelength is λ2_obs = λ2_rest * (1 + v_r / c) / sqrt(1 - (v_r^2/c^2)) ) ? Wait, no, maybe it's better to use the relativistic formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the observed λ_max is same, but the stars have different actual temperatures due to their velocities. So let's model this.

Let me define:

For Star_1: T1 is the actual temperature. Since v1=0, observed λ_max is λ1 = b / T1.

For Star_2: actual λ_max is λ2 = b / T2. Observed λ2_obs = λ2 * Doppler shift factor.

Since λ1_obs = λ2_obs,

b/T1 = (b/T2) * Doppler factor.

So Doppler factor is (T2)/(T1) = [T2/(T1)] = [Doppler factor]^{-1}.

Wait, perhaps I should write Doppler factor as D, so D = λ_obs / λ_rest.

Wait, for Star_2, λ2_obs = D * λ2_rest.

But λ2_rest = b/T2.

So,

λ2_obs = D * (b / T2) = (D / T2) * b.

But λ1_obs = b / T1.

So, b/T1 = (D / T2) * b.

Cancel b,

1/T1 = D / T2.

=> T2 = T1 * D.

But what is D? D is the Doppler factor, which is λ_obs / λ_rest for Star_2.

So, D = λ_obs / λ_rest = [λ_star2_obs]/[λ_star2_rest].

Wait, but λ_star2_obs = λ_star1_rest (since λ_observed is same for both stars), which is equal to b/T1.

And λ_star2_rest is b/T2.

So,

D = (b/T1) / (b/T2) ) = T2 / T1.

So, D = T2 / T1.

But earlier, from 1/T1 = D / T2,

Substituting D = T2/T1,

1/T1 = (T2/T1) / T2.

Wait, that would be 1/T1 = 1/(T1 * T2) * T2?

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me try again.

Let me write the Doppler shift formula correctly. The Doppler factor for wavelength is given by:

λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) ) )

Assuming Star_2 is moving away, so v is positive.

But wait, the observed λ_obs is the same as that of Star_1. So,

λ1 = λ2_obs.

λ1 = b / T1.

λ2_obs = λ2_rest * Doppler factor.

λ2_rest = b / T2.

So,

b/T1 = (b/T2) * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

We can cancel b,

1/T1 = (1/T2) * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

Multiply both sides by T2,

T2 / T1 = sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

So,

(T2/T1)^2 = (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c)

Take square of both sides.

So,

(T2/T1)^2 = (1 + (700e3)/(3e5)) / (1 - (700e3)/(3e5) )

Wait, 700 km/s is 7e5 m/s. c is about 3e8 m/s. So 700,000 m/s is 7e5. So 7e5 / 3e8 = 7/(300) ≈ 0.023333.

So,

(1 + 0.023333) / (1 - 0.023333) ) ≈ (1.023333) / (0.9766667) ≈ Let's compute that:

1.023333 / 0.9766667 ≈ Let's calculate numerator and denominator.

1.023333 ≈ 1 + 0.023333 = about 1.023333.

0.9766667 ≈ 0.976667.

So 1.023333 / 0.976667 ≈ Let's compute:

Approximately, 1.023333 / 0.976667 ≈ 1.048 approximately.

Wait, let me compute more accurately.

1.023333 divided by 0.9766667.

1.023333 * (1/0.9766667) ≈ 1.023333 * 1.0241 approximately.

Wait, 1/0.9766667 is approximately 1.0241 (because 0.9766667 ≈ 1 - 0.023333, so 1/(1-x) ≈ 1 + x when x is small, so 1 + 0.023333 ≈ 1.023333. Wait, perhaps a better way: Let's compute 0.9766667 as roughly 0.9767.

So 1.023333 / 0.9767 ≈ let's compute:

0.9767 * 1.048 ≈ 1.023333?

Wait, 0.9767 * 1.048:

0.9767 * 1 = 0.9767

0.9767 * 0.048 ≈ approx 0.047 (since 0.9767 *0.04= ~0.039, 0.9767 *0.008= ~0.0078; total ~0.0468)

Add: 0.9767 + 0.0468 ≈ 1.0235, which is about our numerator 1.023333. So approximately 1.048.

So the square of (T2/T1) is approximately 1.048. So T2/T1 = sqrt(1.048) ≈ 1.0237.

So T2 ≈ T1 * 1.0237.

Wait, but wait. Since Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s, and we assumed it's moving away, the observed wavelength is longer than the rest wavelength. But since Star_1 has a shorter wavelength (if T1 is higher), but wait, earlier conclusion is that T2 is higher than T1? Because T2/T1 is about 1.0237, so T2 is higher.

But let's think: if Star_2 is moving away, its observed wavelength is longer than its rest wavelength. So for Star_2, λ_obs = λ2_rest * (1 + v/c) (non-relativistic approximation). So λ_obs > λ2_rest.

But Star_1's λ_obs is λ1_rest, so if λ_obs is same for both, then λ1_rest must be longer than λ2_rest.

Because λ1_rest = λ_obs, which is same as Star_2's λ_obs. But Star_2's λ_obs is longer than its λ_rest.

So λ1_rest > λ2_rest.

But since λ is inversely proportional to T, this would imply that T1 < T2.

Wait, λ = b / T. So if λ1 > λ2, then T1 < T2.

So T2 > T1.

Which aligns with our earlier calculation that T2 = T1 * 1.0237.

So, T2 is about 2.37% higher than T1.

So, with that, now we can compute the luminosities.

L = 4π R² σ T⁴.

So L1 = 4π (R1)^2 σ T1^4.

L2 = 4π (R2)^2 σ T2^4.

We need to find L1/L2.

L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1 / T2)^4.

We know R1 = 1.5 R2.

So (R1/R2)^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25.

T1/T2 = 1 / (1.0237) ≈ 0.9768.

So (0.9768)^4 ≈ Let's compute this.

0.9768^2 = approx (0.9768)*(0.9768). Let's compute 0.977^2.

0.977 * 0.977: 977 * 977.

Well, 1000^2 = 1e6, 977 is 23 less. So (1000 -23)^2 = 1e6 -2*1000*23 + 23^2 = 1e6 - 46,000 + 529 ≈ 954,529. So 0.977^2 ≈ 0.954529.

Then, 0.954529^2 = (0.9545)^2.

Approximately, 0.9545 * 0.9545.

Let me compute 0.95^2 = 0.9025. 0.0045 * 0.95 * 2 = 0.00855. And 0.0045^2= 0.00002025. So total approx 0.9025 + 0.00855 + 0.00002025 ≈ 0.91107.

Wait, alternatively, 0.9545^2 is about (0.95 + 0.0045)^2 = 0.95^2 + 2*(0.95)(0.0045) + (0.0045)^2 = 0.9025 + 0.00855 + 0.00002025 ≈ 0.91107.

So 0.9545^2 ≈ 0.91107.

So (0.9768)^4 ≈ 0.911.

So L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.911 ≈ 2.05.

Wait, that can't be right. Because earlier conclusion is that T2 is higher than T1, and R1 is 1.5 R2. So L1 is 2.25 in radius squared, but T is lower, so T^4 is lower.

Wait, 2.25 * (0.9768)^4. Wait, 0.9768 is about 0.977. Let me compute (0.977)^4 more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the assumption about the direction of velocity. Maybe Star_2 is moving towards us, which would blueshift its light. Let me reevaluate.

Wait, the problem says that Star_2's radial velocity is 700 km/s, but we don't know the direction. So perhaps if Star_2 is moving towards us, the observed λ would be shorter. Let's recalculate.

In that case, the Doppler shift would be blueshift, so λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

Wait, so for Star_2, if it's moving towards us, v is positive, so:

λ_obs = λ2_rest * sqrt( (1 - v/c) / (1 + v/c) )

So then, for Star_1, λ1_obs = λ1_rest = b/T1.

For Star_2, λ2_obs = λ2_rest * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

And λ1_obs = λ2_obs.

Thus,

b/T1 = (b/T2) * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

Again, cancel b,

1/T1 = (1/T2) * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

So,

T2 / T1 = sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ) )

Ah, because I took reciprocal on both sides.

Wait, let's see: 1/T1 = (1/T2) * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

=> T2 / T1 = [1/( sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )) ]

Which is,

T2 / T1 = sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ) )

So, in this case, when Star_2 is moving towards us, the ratio T2/T1 is sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

Which is the same as the previous case when it was moving away.

Wait, but that can't be right because moving towards would imply a different direction.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the Doppler formula. Let me double-check.

The relativistic Doppler shift formula for wavelength when the source is moving towards the observer is λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) ) )

So in this case, when the source moves towards us, λ_obs is less than λ_rest, which makes sense (blueshifted).

So in the case where Star_2 is moving towards us, the equation becomes:

λ1_obs = λ2_obs = λ2_rest * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

So,

b/T1 = (b/T2) * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

Same equation as before. So T2/T1 = sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

Which is the same as in the previous case where Star_2 was moving away.

Wait, but how can that be? Because moving towards us would make the observed λ smaller, which would imply T is higher (since λ= b/T). So whether Star_2 is moving towards or away, the observed λ_obs is same as Star_1. So for that to happen, if Star_2 is moving towards us, its rest λ must be smaller. Because when moving towards us, λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

So, for Star_2's λ_rest to be smaller, it's actual temperature is higher.

So the equation leads us to T2 = T1 * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

Which is the same as before, regardless of the direction of the velocity. That's because the formula for the Doppler factor when moving towards is the reciprocal of when moving away. Wait, no, the formula for moving towards gives a lower λ_obs. But since we're equating λ_obs to Star_1's λ, which is fixed, but the direction of velocity affects whether the ratio increases or decreases.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the Doppler formula. Let me clarify.

The correct relativistic Doppler shift formula is:

λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ) 

when the source is moving away. 

When the source is moving towards the observer (v positive, approaching), the formula becomes:

λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

So in this case, if Star_2 is moving towards us, then:

λ_obs = λ2_rest * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

We have λ1_obs = λ2_obs.

So,

b/T1 = (b/T2) * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

=> T2 / T1 = sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

So same as before.

But v is 700 km/s, which is positive when moving away. Hmm, but in this case, if Star_2 is moving towards us, then v is negative (assuming v is positive when moving away). So perhaps I should take v as negative.

Wait, perhaps I should define v as the radial velocity, with v positive when moving away, negative when approaching.

In that case, for Star_2, if it's moving towards us, v = -700 km/s.

So,

λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

But with v negative, it becomes:

sqrt( (1 - 700e3/(3e5 c)) / (1 + 700e3/(3e5 c)) )

Which is same as sqrt( (1 - 0.023333) / (1 + 0.023333) )

Which is sqrt(0.976667 / 1.023333) ≈ sqrt(0.954) ≈ 0.977.

So,

T2 / T1 = sqrt( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) )

But with v = -700 km/s,

(1 + v/c) = 1 - 0.023333 = 0.976667.

(1 - v/c) = 1 + 0.023333 = 1.023333.

So,

(1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) = 0.976667 / 1.023333 ≈ 0.954.

So sqrt(0.954) ≈ 0.977.

So,

T2 / T1 = 0.977.

Which means T2 is less than T1.

Wait, but earlier when I took v positive (moving away), I had T2/T1 = 1.0237. Now, when v is negative (moving towards), T2/T1 is 0.977. So this changes the conclusion.

So this is a crucial point. The direction of the velocity matters. But the problem doesn't specify the direction of Star_2's velocity. So without knowing whether it's moving towards or away, I can't proceed accurately. Hmm, but this is a problem, because the direction affects the calculation of T2 and thus the luminosity.

Wait, but perhaps the problem is set in such a way that the Doppler shift is accounted for, and the observed wavelengths are same, but the actual temperatures may vary. So perhaps I should proceed with the correct Doppler formula, considering the direction.

But without knowing the direction, perhaps I can't proceed. Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the 700 km/s is a radial velocity towards us.

Wait, but the problem statement says "the radial velocities of the two stars to be 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2 respectively."

So, Star_1 has 0, Star_2 has 700 km/s. But the direction isn't specified. So perhaps the problem expects us to take v as positive when moving away, but maybe it's given as a magnitude, so 700 km/s is the speed, but direction is unknown. That complicates things.

But perhaps the problem is intended to have the Doppler shift considered, but since the problem doesn't specify direction, perhaps the intended approach is to ignore the Doppler shift and proceed with T1 = T2. But that can't be the case because the question then would lead to L1/L2 = 2.25, which is option A, but the options include other factors. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to consider that the stars have same temperature, but that can't be the case because their wavelengths observed are same but their velocities are different.

Wait, perhaps the problem is phrased as the stars appear brightest at the same wavelength, but the observed wavelength. So, the observed λ_max is same, but the actual λ_max (rest frame) could be different due to Doppler shift. So the correct way is to calculate the actual T1 and T2, considering the Doppler shift, then compute L1 and L2.

But without knowing the direction of Star_2's velocity, I can't proceed. So perhaps the problem expects us to ignore the velocity effect, which would make L1/L2=2.25, but that's option A. However, the options B, C, D are close to that, so I think the problem expects the Doppler shift to be considered.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the Doppler shift doesn't affect the temperature determination because the stars are moving with velocities that are non-relativistic, and the observed wavelength is used to find the temperature. Hmm, but that may not be correct. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the observed wavelengths are same, which implies that the actual temperatures are same, but that's not correct because Doppler shift changes the observed wavelength.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again.

The problem says that the stars radiate as black bodies. So their luminosities are determined by their radii and temperatures. The question asks for L1/L2.

We have R1=1.5 R2.

We need to find T1 and T2.

The observed λ_max for both stars is same. So λ1_obs = λ2_obs.

But, the observed λ for each star is related to their rest λ via Doppler shift.

So, for Star_1: v1=0, so λ1_rest = λ1_obs.

For Star_2: λ2_obs = λ2_rest * Doppler factor.

Thus, λ1_obs = λ2_obs => λ1_rest = Doppler factor * λ2_rest.

But λ_rest = b / T.

So,

b/T1 = Doppler factor * (b/T2)

Cancel b,

1/T1 = Doppler factor * (1/T2)

=> T2 = T1 * Doppler factor.

Doppler factor depends on v.

But without knowing the direction, perhaps we can proceed with the formula.

Wait, but the radial velocity is given as 700 km/s, but without direction, I can't compute the exact Doppler factor. So perhaps the problem is intended to ignore the Doppler effect, but that would make the T same, and L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25, which is option A.

But the options include other choices. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the stars' rest wavelengths are same, but due to Doppler shift, the observed wavelengths are same. But that scenario would require that the Doppler shift is same, but that's not possible unless the velocities are same, which they aren't.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the observed wavelengths are same, which implies that the products of the rest wavelength and Doppler factor are same for both stars. But Star_1 has no velocity, so λ1_rest = λ1_obs. Star_2's λ_obs = Doppler factor * λ2_rest. So,

λ1_obs = Doppler factor * λ2_rest.

But λ1_rest = λ1_obs.

So,

λ1_rest = Doppler factor * λ2_rest.

Thus,

λ1_rest / λ2_rest = Doppler factor.

But λ_rest = b / T.

So,

(T2 / T1 ) = Doppler factor.

So,

T2 = T1 * Doppler factor.

But without knowing which way the star is moving, I can't proceed. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the Doppler shift is negligible because v is small compared to c? Let's see: v=700e3 m/s, c=3e8 m/s. 700e3 /3e8 = 0.002333. So, about 0.23% of c. So, non-relativistic Doppler approximation can be used.

So for non-relativistic Doppler shift,

λ_obs ≈ λ_rest (1 + v_r / c )

But the problem states that λ_obs for both stars is same.

So for Star_1, v_r =0, so λ1_obs = λ1_rest.

For Star_2, λ2_obs = λ2_rest (1 + v_r / c )

Set λ1_obs = λ2_obs,

λ1_rest = λ2_rest (1 + v_r / c )

So,

λ1_rest / λ2_rest = 1 + v_r / c.

But λ_rest = b / T,

so,

(T2 / T1 ) = 1 + v_r / c.

So,

T2 = T1 (1 + v_r / c )

But v_r is 700 km/s. Let's compute 700e3 m/s / 3e8 m/s = 7e5 / 3e8 = 7/(300) ≈ 0.023333.

So,

T2 = T1 (1 + 0.023333 ) ≈ T1 * 1.023333.

So T2 is about 2.33% higher than T1.

Now, compute L1/L2.

L = 4π R^2 σ T^4.

So,

L1/L2 = (R1^2 / R2^2) * (T1^4 / T2^4 )

We have R1 = 1.5 R2,

So,

(R1/R2)^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25.

T1 / T2 = 1 / 1.023333 ≈ 0.977.

So,

(T1 / T2)^4 ≈ (0.977)^4.

Compute 0.977^4:

0.977^2 ≈ 0.9545.

(0.9545)^2 ≈ 0.911.

So,

L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.911 ≈ 2.05. Hmm, but this is not matching any of the options. Wait, the options are approximately 2.23, 2.25, 2.32, 2.35. So this approach must be wrong.

Wait, wait a second. Because I used the non-relativistic Doppler shift which approximates λ_obs ≈ λ_rest (1 + v/c ). But that's when the source is moving away. If the source is moving towards us, then it's λ_obs ≈ λ_rest (1 - v/c ), which would cause a blueshift.

So perhaps the correct scenario is that Star_2 is moving towards us, which would mean the Doppler factor is (1 - v/c ), not (1 + v/c ).

So,

λ_obs = λ_rest (1 - v/c )

So,

λ1_rest = λ2_rest (1 - v/c )

Thus,

λ1_rest / λ2_rest = 1 - v/c.

So,

T2 / T1 = 1 - v/c.

v is 700 km/s, so v/c = 0.023333.

So,

T2 = T1 (1 - 0.023333 ) ≈ T1 * 0.976667.

Then,

T2 is 2.33% lower than T1.

So,

L1/L2 = (R1^2 / R2^2) * (T1^4 / T2^4 )

R1/R2 = 1.5, so (1.5)^2 = 2.25.

T1/T2 = 1 / 0.976667 ≈ 1.0237.

So,

(T1/T2)^4 ≈ (1.0237)^4.

Compute 1.0237^4:

1.0237^2 ≈ 1.048.

1.048^2 ≈ 1.098.

So,

(T1/T2)^4 ≈ 1.098.

So,

L1/L2 ≈ 2.25 * 1.098 ≈ 2.47.

But none of the options are close to 2.47. So this approach is leading me to confusion.

Wait, perhaps I should use the exact relativistic Doppler formula instead of the non-relativistic approximation.

So, relativistic Doppler factor for wavelength is:

λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

When the star is moving away (v positive), λ_obs is longer. When moving towards, v is negative, making λ_obs shorter.

The problem says that the observed λ_max is same for both stars. So,

λ1_rest = λ_obs (Star_1) = λ_obs (Star_2) = λ2_rest * Doppler factor.

So,

λ1_rest = λ2_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

But λ_rest = b / T.

So,

b/T1 = (b/T2) * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

Cancel b,

1/T1 = (1/T2) * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

Which gives,

T2 = T1 * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

v is 700 km/s, so v/c = 7e5 /3e8 = 7/(300) ≈ 0.023333.

So,

(1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) = (1.023333)/(0.976667) ≈ 1.048.

So sqrt(1.048) ≈ 1.0237.

Thus, T2 = T1 * 1.0237.

So,

T2 is about 2.37% higher than T1.

Now compute L1/L2.

L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1 / T2)^4.

We have R1/R2 = 1.5, so (1.5)^2 = 2.25.

T1 / T2 = 1 / 1.0237 ≈ 0.9768.

(0.9768)^4.

Compute 0.9768^2 = 0.9768 * 0.9768.

Approx : 0.9768 * 0.9768 ≈ (0.977)^2 = 0.9545 (as calculated before).

Then, 0.9545 squared is approximately 0.911.

So,

L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.911 ≈ 2.05.

But this isn't matching any of the options. The options are all around 2.23~2.35.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the direction of velocity. Let me consider that Star_2 is moving towards us, which would make v negative. So,

Doppler factor = sqrt( (1 + (-v/c))/(1 - (-v/c)) ) = sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

So,

T2/T1 = sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )^{-1} ?

Wait, let's redo that.

When the star is moving towards us, v is negative.

So,

λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

But since v is negative, let's substitute v = -700e3 m/s.

So,

(1 + v/c) = 1 - 700e3 /3e8 = 1 - 0.023333 = 0.976667.

(1 - v/c) = 1 + 0.023333 = 1.023333.

So,

(1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) = 0.976667 / 1.023333 ≈ 0.954.

So,

sqrt(0.954) ≈ 0.977.

Thus,

T2 / T1 = 0.977.

So,

T2 = T1 * 0.977.

Thus,

T1 / T2 ≈ 1.0237.

So,

(T1/T2)^4 ≈ (1.0237)^4 ≈ 1.098.

So,

L1/L2 = 2.25 * 1.098 ≈ 2.47.

Not matching any options.

Hmm, perhaps the problem expects us to ignore the Doppler shift, which would make L1/L2 = 2.25, option A. But the options include D) ~2.23, which is close to 2.25.

Wait, let me think again. Maybe the problem doesn't require considering the Doppler shift, because the observed wavelength being same implies same temperature. But that's only true if there's no Doppler shift, which is only the case for v=0. But Star_2 has a velocity, so its actual temperature must be different.

But perhaps the problem is intended to consider that the stars have same temperature, but that's not consistent with the given velocities.

Wait, perhaps the problem is mistakenly worded, and the observed wavelengths are the same, but the stars are at different distances, and the luminosity is calculated using the flux. But I think that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the ratio using the exact (relativistic) Doppler shift formula, not the non-relativistic approximation.

Wait, let me recompute with exact Doppler factor.

v =700 km/s=7e5 m/s.

c=3e8 m/s.

v/c=7e5/3e8=7/(300)=0.023333.

Doppler factor for λ_obs when source is moving away: sqrt( (1+v/c)/(1 -v/c) )

= sqrt( (1.023333)/(0.976667) )

= sqrt(1.048) ≈ 1.0237.

So,

T2 = T1 * 1.0237.

Then, T1/T2 = 1/1.0237 ≈ 0.9768.

So, (T1/T2)^4 = (0.9768)^4 ≈ 0.911.

So,

L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 * 0.911 = 2.25 * 0.911 ≈ 2.05.

So, this would be around 2.05, which is not among the choices. So I must have made a mistake in my approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem doesn't consider the Doppler shift and just assumes T1 = T2.

In that case, L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25, which is option A.

But why are the other options present then? Hmm, perhaps the problem requires considering the mass-luminosity relation.

Wait, when the problem states that the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2, perhaps it's intended to use the mass-luminosity relation, which is L ∝ M^3 for main-sequence stars.

But earlier, I thought that the problem is about black body radiation, so perhaps the mass-luminosity relation is a red herring.

Wait, the problem says: "Assuming that the stars radiate as black bodies, they computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of:"

Ah, so the mass is given, but the L is to be computed based on black body assumption. So probably, the mass is a distractor, and the correct approach is to ignore the mass and compute based on R and T.

So, let's proceed under that assumption.

So, R1=1.5 R2.

T1 and T2 are determined by the fact that observed λ_max are same.

So, from previous calculations, if Star_2 is moving towards us, T2 = T1 * 0.977, leading to L1/L2=2.47, which is not in the options.

Alternatively, if Star_2 is moving away, T2 = T1 *1.0237, leading to L1/L2=2.05, which is also not in the options.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is intended to ignore the Doppler shift, so T1=T2.

Thus, L1/L2=(1.5)^2=2.25, option A.

But the options include D) ~2.23, which is very close to 2.25.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects us to compute using the exact Doppler shift (relativistic) but with the correct direction.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier direction assumption.

Let me recompute with exact Doppler factor.

Case 1: Star_2 is moving towards us.

v = -700 km/s.

Doppler factor for λ is sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

= sqrt( (1 - 0.023333)/(1 + 0.023333) )

= sqrt(0.976667 / 1.023333 )

= sqrt(0.954) ≈ 0.977.

So,

λ_obs = λ_rest * 0.977.

But since λ_obs is same for both stars,

λ1_rest = λ2_rest * 0.977.

So,

b/T1 = (b/T2 ) * 0.977.

=> T2 = T1 * 0.977.

Thus,

(L1/L2) = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4.

R1/R2=1.5 → (1.5)^2=2.25.

T1/T2=1/0.977≈1.0237.

(1.0237)^4 ≈ (1.0237)^2 = 1.048 → (1.048)^2 ≈1.098.

So,

L1/L2=2.25 * 1.098 = 2.47.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps this approach is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the Doppler shift. Let me recompute relativistic Doppler factor accurately.

v =700 km/s =7e5 m/s.

v/c =7e5 /3e8 = 7 /300 ≈ 0.023333333.

Compute (1 + v/c) =1.023333333.

(1 - v/c)=0.976666667.

(1.023333333)/(0.976666667) = 1.048.

So sqrt(1.048) = approximately 1.0237.

So, if Star_2 is moving away, Doppler factor is 1.0237.

Thus,

T2 = T1 * 1.0237.

Which gives,

(T1/T2)^4 ≈ (0.9768)^4 ≈0.911.

So,

L1/L2=2.25 *0.911=2.05.

But the options are all around 2.23-2.35, which is higher than 2.25. So this can't be.

Wait, perhaps I've made a mistake in the initial calculation of the Doppler shift.

Alternative approach: perhaps the problem is using the inverse Doppler shift. Let me think.

Wait, the formula for Doppler shift in terms of temperature is Δλ/λ = v/c.

But no, that's for non-relativistic shifts. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the observed wavelength is longer for Star_2, which implies lower T.

But I'm getting stuck here. Let me consider another angle.

The options suggest that the correct factor is approximately 2.23, 2.25, 2.32, or 2.35.

If I calculate (1.5^2) * (1/(1.0237)^4 ), let me compute that.

1.5^2=2.25.

(1.0237)^4 ≈ 1.098.

So,

2.25 * (1/1.098) ≈ 2.25 * 0.911 ≈ 2.05.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering only the radius and assuming same temperature, leading to 2.25, option A.

But why are the other options present? Or perhaps the problem includes the Doppler shift in a way I'm not considering.

Wait, perhaps the problem intended to ignore the Doppler shift, but the actual correct calculation includes it, but I'm not seeing it.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem statement is incorrect, and the luminosity is calculated without considering the Doppler shift.

Alternatively, perhaps I missed a factor of 4 or some other constant, but in the formulas, all constants cancel out.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

Compute (T1/T2)^4 when T2 = T1 * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

So,

(T1/T2) = 1 / sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

= sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

= sqrt( (0.976667)/(1.023333) )

= sqrt(0.954)

≈ 0.977.

So,

(T1/T2)^4 = (0.977)^4.

Compute 0.977^4:

0.977^2 = 0.977 * 0.977.

Let me compute this accurately:

0.977 * 0.977.

= (1 - 0.023) * (1 - 0.023)

= 1 - 2*0.023 + (0.023)^2

= 1 - 0.046 + 0.000529

= 0.954529.

Then, 0.954529^2.

= (0.954529) * (0.954529)

Let me compute this:

0.95 * 0.95 = 0.9025.

0.004529 * 0.95 = 0.00430255.

0.95 * 0.004529 = 0.00430255.

0.004529 * 0.004529 ≈ 0.0000205.

So adding:

0.9025 + 0.00430255 + 0.00430255 + 0.0000205 ≈ 0.9025 + 0.008605 + 0.0000205 ≈ 0.9111255.

So,

(T1/T2)^4 ≈ 0.9111.

Thus,

L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.9111 ≈ 2.05.

So, 2.05 is about 2.05, but the closest option is D) 2.23, which is 0.18 higher. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the Doppler formula. Let me check again.

The Doppler shift formula is:

λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

But for a source moving away, v is positive. So if Star_2 is moving away, its observed λ is longer. But since both stars have same observed λ, this implies that Star_2's rest λ is shorter than Star_1's.

Which means T2 is higher than T1.

But when I took v as positive (moving away), T2 was higher.

Thus,

L1/L2 = 2.25 * (0.9768)^4 ≈ 2.25 * 0.911 ≈ 2.05.

But none of the options match, so perhaps the problem is intended to ignore the Doppler shift, leading to L1/L2=2.25, option A.

But why are other options present? Alternatively, perhaps the problem includes the Doppler shift but with a different approach.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is considering that the observed flux is same for both stars, but that's not stated.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the observed wavelengths are same, so the actual temperatures are same, but that would require that the Doppler shifts cancel out. But that's only possible if the velocities are same, which they aren't.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Given the time I've spent, perhaps the intended answer is option D) ~2.23, which is close to 2.25, but perhaps due to a more precise calculation.

Wait, let's compute the exact value.

Compute (1.5)^2 = 2.25.

Compute (0.9768)^4.

0.9768^2 = 0.9768 * 0.9768.

Compute 9768 * 9768:

Let me compute 9768 * 9768.

But perhaps it's easier to compute (1 - 0.0232)^2 = (approx 0.9768)^2.

But perhaps I should compute it accurately.

Wait, 0.9768 * 0.9768:

= (0.9 + 0.0768)^2

= 0.81 + 2*0.9*0.0768 + 0.0768^2

= 0.81 + 0.13824 + 0.005900

= 0.81 + 0.13824 = 0.94824 + 0.005900= 0.95414.

Then, (0.95414)^2.

= (0.95 + 0.00414)^2

= 0.9025 + 2*(0.95)(0.00414) + (0.00414)^2

= 0.9025 + 0.007962 + 0.0000171

≈ 0.9025 + 0.007962 = 0.910462 + 0.0000171 ≈ 0.910479.

So,

L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.910479 ≈ 2.25 * 0.9105 ≈ 2.049.

Which is about 2.05.

But if I compute more accurately, perhaps the factor is 2.05, but the options don't have this. So perhaps the problem expects us to not account for the Doppler shift, leading to 2.25, option A.

But the options include D) ~2.23, which is very close to 2.25. Maybe a calculation mistake in the problem setup.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the mass to find the luminosity.

Wait, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. For main-sequence stars, L ∝ M^3.

So, L1/L2 = (1.5)^3 = 3.375.

But this isn't among the options, so probably the problem expects to use the black body approach, not the mass-luminosity relation.

I think I've reached the limit of my analysis. Given that the problem states to assume black body radiation, and the calculated L1/L2 with Doppler shift considered is approximately 2.05, which isn't an option, but without considering Doppler, it's 2.25, which is option A. However, the options include D) ~2.23, which is very close to 2.25.

But wait, perhaps I should compute it more precisely, using exact Doppler.

Compute v/c = 700,000 / 300,000,000 = 7/300 ≈ 0.0233333333.

So,

(1 + v/c) = 1.023333333.

(1 - v/c) = 0.976666667.

Their ratio is 1.023333333 / 0.976666667 ≈ 1.048.

So,

sqrt(1.048) = approximately 1.02371.

So,

T2 = T1 *1.02371.

So,

T1/T2 = 1 / 1.02371 ≈ 0.97679.

Compute (0.97679)^4.

0.97679^2 = (approx 0.9768)^2 = 0.95414.

0.95414^2 = 0.91047.

So,

L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.91047 ≈ 2.05.

But this still doesn't match.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects to compute without considering the Doppler shift, so L1/L2=2.25, which is option A.

But the options include D) ~2.23, which is closer to 2.25.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the Doppler factor.

Wait, perhaps I should compute sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ) more accurately.

Compute (1.023333333)/(0.976666667) = 1.048076923.

sqrt(1.048076923) = ?

Let me compute this accurately.

1.048076923 is between 1.048 and 1.0481.

Compute 1.0237^2= (1.0237)^2= 1.04807.

Yes, so sqrt(1.048076923) is 1.0237.

So,

T2 = T1 *1.0237.

So,

T1/T2=0.9768.

Thus,

(0.9768)^4 = 0.911.

So,

L1/L2= 2.25 *0.911=2.05.

But since this is not an option, perhaps the intended approach is to ignore Doppler shift. So,

L1/L2=2.25, which is option A.

But the options include D) ~2.23, which is very close to 2.25.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem intended to have the velocity of Star_2 as zero, making the observed wavelengths same, but that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem has a typo, and the velocities are swapped.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects to consider both radius and mass.

Wait, if I compute using L ∝ R^2 T^4 (black body) and also consider that L ∝ M^3 (mass-luminosity), but I think that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects to compute using the mass-luminosity relation, which gives L1/L2= (1.5)^3=3.375, which is not an option.

So, considering all this, perhaps the intended answer is option D) ~2.23.

Wait, but without knowing the exact approach, it's hard to choose between A and D.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem meant that the stars have same apparent brightness (same flux), but the question states that the wavelengths where they appear brightest are same, which relates to their temperatures, not flux.

Hmm, I think I've exhausted all approaches.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves determining the luminosity ratio of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2, assuming they radiate as black bodies. Key details include:

1. **Given Data**:
   - Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2: \( R_1 = 1.5 R_2 \).
   - Star_1's mass is 1.5 times that of Star_2: \( M_1 = 1.5 M_2 \).
   - The observed wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest (\( \lambda_{\text{obs}} \)) are the same for both stars.
   - Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0 km/s, while Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s.

2. **Key Relationships**:
   - Luminosity of a black body: \( L = 4 \pi R^2 \sigma T^4 \), where \( R \) is the radius and \( T \) is the temperature.
   - Wien's Law: \( \lambda_{\text{max}} = \frac{b}{T} \), where \( b \) is Wien's displacement constant.
   - Relativistic Doppler shift formula for wavelength: \( \lambda_{\text{obs}} = \lambda_{\text{rest}} \sqrt{\frac{1 + v/c}{1 - v/c}} \), where \( v \) is the radial velocity and \( c \) is the speed of light.

3. **Analysis**:
   - Since the observed wavelengths (\( \lambda_{\text{obs}} \)) are the same for both stars, their rest wavelengths (\( \lambda_{\text{rest}} \)) must differ due to the Doppler effect for Star_2.
   - Using Wien's Law, \( \lambda_{\text{rest}} = \frac{b}{T} \), the temperature ratio \( T_2 / T_1 \) is determined by the Doppler factor:
     \[
     T_2 = T_1 \sqrt{\frac{1 + v/c}{1 - v/c}}
     \]
     Substituting \( v = 700 \, \text{km/s} \) and \( c = 3 \times 10^5 \, \text{km/s} \), we find:
     \[
     \frac{v}{c} = \frac{700}{300,000} \approx 0.02333, \quad \sqrt{\frac{1 + 0.02333}{1 - 0.02333}} \approx 1.0237
     \]
     Thus, \( T_2 \approx 1.0237 T_1 \).

   - The luminosity ratio is given by:
     \[
     \frac{L_1}{L_2} = \left(\frac{R_1}{R_2}\right)^2 \left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4
     \]
     Substituting \( R_1 / R_2 = 1.5 \) and \( T_1 / T_2 = 1 / 1.0237 \approx 0.9768 \):
     \[
     \left(\frac{R_1}{R_2}\right)^2 = 1.5^2 = 2.25, \quad \left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4 = (0.9768)^4 \approx 0.911
     \]
     Therefore:
     \[
     \frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \times 0.911 \approx 2.05
     \]

4. **Options Analysis**:
   - The calculated ratio \( L_1 / L_2 \approx 2.05 \) does not match any of the provided options exactly.
   - If the Doppler shift is ignored (i.e., \( T_1 = T_2 \)), the luminosity ratio simplifies to:
     \[
     \frac{L_1}{L_2} = \left(\frac{R_1}{R_2}\right)^2 = 2.25
     \]
     This corresponds to option A.
   - The closest option to the calculated value \( \approx 2.05 \) is D) \( \sim 2.23 \), which may account for more precise calculations or approximations in the problem setup.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The problem likely expects the Doppler shift to be ignored, leading to \( L_1 / L_2 = 2.25 \), which matches option A. However, the inclusion of option D (\( \sim 2.23 \)) suggests that a more precise calculation might yield a value closer to this range.
