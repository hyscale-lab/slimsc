Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit unsure, but let's try to break it down. The question is about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. Hmm, I remember that when a medium is moving, it affects how light propagates through it, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact details.

So the setup is a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the light beam. And the light is moving towards an observer in the lab. The question is asking what's the speed of the light relative to the observer.

Wait, wait. I think I remember something about how the speed of light in a medium isn't just c/n regardless of the medium's motion. Because the medium's motion affects it in some way. Or maybe it's a case of adding velocities? But wait, Einstein's theory says that the speed of light is constant in all inertial frames. So that might not apply here because the glass is moving, but the light is in the glass.

Wait, no, wait. The speed of light in a medium at rest is c/n. When the medium is moving, does the speed of light in the medium change? I'm a bit confused here.

I think about the Doppler effect. Oh wait, no, that's about frequency changes, not speed. Or maybe about how the speed is measured in the lab frame.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think using the velocity addition formula from special relativity. Because the glass is moving, and the light is moving through it. So the observer in the lab would see the light's velocity as the sum of the medium's velocity and the light's velocity in the medium, but adjusted for relativistic effects.

Wait, but the velocity addition formula applies when moving from one inertial frame to another. Hmm. Let me think. The medium is moving at velocity v relative to the lab. The light in the medium has a velocity u, which in the medium's frame is c/n. So in the lab frame, the velocity of light would be u' = (u + v)/(1 + (u v)/c²). Since c=1, that would be (u + v)/(1 + u v).

But wait, wait. Let me clarify. The medium is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the light. So in the medium's rest frame, the light is moving at speed u = c/n. So from the lab's perspective, which is moving at velocity v relative to the medium, the light's speed would be calculated using the Lorentz velocity addition formula.

So u' = (u + v) / (1 + u v). Since u = c/n, and c=1, u is 1/n. Plugging that in: (1/n + v) / (1 + (1/n)*v). 

Wait, let me compute that. Numerator is (1/n + v) and denominator is (1 + v/n). Let me factor out 1/n from numerator and denominator. Wait, but that might complicate things. Alternatively, let's multiply numerator and denominator by n to eliminate the denominator. So numerator becomes (1 + v n), denominator becomes n (1 + v/n) = n + v. So the whole expression becomes (1 + v n)/(n + v). Wait, but that's the same as (1 + n v)/(n + v). So the speed would be (1 + n v)/(n + v).

But wait, that's one of the options. Looking at the options, option A is (1 +n v)/(n +v), option C is (1 +n v)/(n -v). Hmm. So according to this, the answer should be option A. But wait, let me think again.

Wait, wait, I think I might have messed up the direction. Because the medium is moving towards the observer. Wait no, the problem says the glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer. Hmm, same direction as the beam, which is toward the observer. Wait, no, the beam is going toward the observer, but the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam, which would be toward the observer. So wait, the glass is moving in the same direction as the light beam, which is towards the observer. So in the lab frame, the glass is moving towards the observer at speed v.

Wait, but when you use the velocity addition formula, you have to think about how velocities transform. So the medium's frame is moving at velocity v relative to the lab. So in the medium's frame, the light is moving at u = c/n. Then from medium to lab, the light's velocity is u' = (u + v)/(1 + u v).

Wait, but in the medium's frame, the light is moving at u = c/n away from the source or towards? Oh wait, in this problem, the light is moving toward the observer in the lab. So in the medium's frame, the light is moving at u = c/n (toward the observer, which is in the same direction as the medium's motion). So the lab sees the light as (u + v)/(1 + u v).

Wait, but if the medium is moving at velocity v towards the observer (because the beam is moving that way), then in the lab frame, the medium is moving at velocity v towards the observer, and the light is moving at speed u in the medium.

So substituting u=1/n. So the formula is (u + v)/(1 + u v) = ( (1/n) + v ) / (1 + (1/n) v ) = (1 + n v)/(n + v) when multiplied numerator and denominator by n.

So that would give option A as the answer.

Wait, but wait, another thought. The speed of light in the medium is c/n, but when the medium is moving, perhaps the overall speed as observed in the lab is different because of the motion. But according to relativity, the speed in any inertial frame should still be c. Wait, no, that's for light traveling in a vacuum. Wait, but in this case, the light is traveling through a medium. So in the lab frame, the light would have a speed based on the medium's motion and its own speed within the medium.

Wait, but that contradicts the idea that the speed of light in a medium is c/n regardless of the medium's velocity. So perhaps I'm confusing this with how light speed is measured in different frames. Oh wait, no: the speed of light in the medium is c/n in the medium's rest frame. But when the medium is moving, the lab frame would observe a different speed. But wait, that can't be right because according to relativity, the speed of light in a vacuum is always c in any inertial frame. But in a medium, the speed is different. Hmm.

Wait, but the question is about the speed of light in the glass, not in a vacuum. So in the lab frame, the glass is moving. So the light's speed would be different.

Wait, another approach: think about the lab frame. The glass is moving towards the observer at speed v. The light is moving through the glass at speed u = c/n. So from the lab's perspective, the relative speed of light would be u' = u + v, but if u is much smaller than c, that's approximately correct. But when speeds are significant compared to c, we need to use relativistic addition.

Wait, but earlier calculation using the velocity addition formula gave us (1 + n v)/(n + v). Let's see what that evaluates to in some limits. For example, if v approaches zero, the expression becomes (1 + 0)/(n +0) = 1/n, which makes sense because when the glass isn't moving, the speed is c/n.

Another test: when the glass is moving at speed v = 0.5 c. So substituting v=0.5, the speed would be (1 +n*0.5)/(n +0.5). If n=1 (like glass), that's (1.5)/(1.5) = 1, which would be c. Hmm, but that's not possible because when the medium is moving at v=0.5c, the light in the medium is at c/n (so 0.5c). But according to the formula, the observed speed is 1, which is c. That seems correct because according to relativity, when the medium is moving at speed v towards the observer, and light is moving at 0.5c in the medium, the observed speed would be higher. So in this case, it adds up to c. But wait, that would mean that when the medium is moving at 0.5c and the light in the medium is moving at 0.5c, the observed speed is c. That seems possible.

But wait, another check: let's have n=1, v=0.8c. Then the formula gives (1 +1*0.8)/(1+0.8) = (1.8)/(1.8) = 1, which is c. Hmm, that's interesting. So regardless of the speed of the medium (as long as it's moving towards and light's speed in medium is 1/n), the observed speed adds up to c when using the formula. But that can't be right, because if the medium is moving at a high speed, the light's speed in the medium is 1/n, but the observed speed would be higher than that.

Wait, but the formula I derived earlier leads to (1 +n v)/(n +v). So when n is 1, it's (1 +v)/(1 +v) =1. So in that case, the observed speed is always c, regardless of v. That seems to contradict my earlier reasoning. Because if the medium is moving at v, and light in the medium is moving at u =1/n, then the observed speed would be u + v, but relativistically adjusted.

Wait another thought: perhaps the speed of light in the medium is v_light = c/n. But when the medium is moving towards the observer at speed v, the observed speed is v_light + v. But that's only in non-relativistic cases. Relativistically, it's (v_light + v)/(1 + (v_light * v)/c²).

Since in this problem, c=1, so it becomes (v_light + v) / (1 + v_light * v).

v_light is c/n, which is 1/n. So substituting, (1/n + v)/(1 + (1/n) v) = (1 + n v)/(n + v). So that's the same as before.

But wait, let's take n=2 and v=0.5. Then the formula gives (1 + 2*0.5)/(2 +0.5) = (2)/(2.5)= 0.8. So the observed speed is 0.8, which is less than c. Wait, but according to the formula, that's correct because when the medium is moving at 0.5c, and the light in the medium is 0.5c (since 1/n=0.5), the observed speed would be (0.5 +0.5)/(1 +0.25) )=1/(1.25)=0.8. Which is correct.

But wait, if the medium is moving towards the observer, and the light is moving towards the observer, wouldn't the observed speed be higher? Oh, but according to the formula, when the medium is moving towards the observer, the light's speed in the lab frame is higher. So for n=1, it's always c, as per the formula. Which makes sense because when n=1, the medium is vacuum, and the speed of light in vacuum is c, which is the same in all frames. So that's consistent.

So the formula gives (1 +n v)/(n +v) as the observed speed of light in the lab frame. So the correct answer is option A.

To determine the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory, we analyze the situation using the relativistic velocity addition formula. The glass is moving at a constant velocity \( v \) in the same direction as the light beam, which is propagating toward the observer. The speed of light in the glass, as measured in the glass's rest frame, is \( u = \frac{1}{n} \), where \( n \) is the refractive index of the glass.

Using the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
u' = \frac{u + v}{1 + \frac{u v}{c^2}}
\]

Since \( c = 1 \) (as given in the problem), this simplifies to:

\[
u' = \frac{u + v}{1 + u v}
\]

Substituting \( u = \frac{1}{n} \):

\[
u' = \frac{\frac{1}{n} + v}{1 + \frac{v}{n}}
\]

To simplify further, multiply the numerator and denominator by \( n \):

\[
u' = \frac{1 + n v}{n + v}
\]

Thus, the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory is:

\[
u' = \frac{1 + n v}{n + v}
\]

This matches option **A**. The other options can be ruled out as follows:
- Option **B** (\( 1 \)) is incorrect because it implies the speed of light is always \( c \), which is only true in a vacuum and not in a medium.
- Option **C** (\( \frac{1 + n v}{n - v} \)) is incorrect because the denominator should be \( n + v \), not \( n - v \), based on the relativistic velocity addition formula.
- Option **D** (\( \frac{1 - n v}{n + v} \)) is incorrect because the numerator should be \( 1 + n v \), not \( 1 - n v \).

Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: A**
