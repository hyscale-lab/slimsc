Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand it.

The question is about an isolated system with 13 identical particles, each having a charge of 2e and negligible mass. Twelve of these charges are constrained to stay at a distance of 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at point P. We need to find the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimal places.

Hmm. So, the system consists of 13 charges, 12 are at 2m from P, and one is at P. Since all particles have the same charge, I think they're all either positive or negative. But the sign might matter for the potential energy calculation? Wait, potential energy between like charges is positive if they're both positive, because the force is repulsive. So if all charges are positive, their mutual repulsion would contribute positive potential energy. But wait, wait, the question is about the minimum energy, so maybe arranging them in a way that the potential energy is as low as possible. 

Wait, but in this setup, the 12 charges are fixed at 2m from P, so their positions are fixed. The 13th is at P, so it's fixed as well. So is the system static, meaning the only energy comes from the interactions between the charges?

I think the energy we're considering is the electrostatic potential energy of the system. Because all the charges are fixed, the kinetic energy is negligible (since masses are negligible, maybe they're point charges not moving). So the total energy should just be the sum of the potential energies between each pair.

So, the potential energy of a system of charges is the sum of the potential energies of each pair. For each pair of charges, the potential energy is given by U = (k * q1 * q2) / r, where k is Coulomb's constant, q1 and q2 are the charges, and r is the distance between them.

In this case, each charge is 2e. So each q is 2e. So for each pair, the calculation would be (k * (2e) * (2e)) / r.

Wait, but how many pairs are there? There are 13 charges, so the total number of pairs is C(13,2) = (13*12)/2 = 78 pairs. But wait, in this setup, the 13th charge is at point P, and the other 12 are all at 2 meters from P. So each of the 12 charges is at a distance of 2 meters from the 13th charge. But the 12 charges are at the same distance from each other? Or are their distances different?

Wait, wait, the problem says the 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2 m from point P. So each of the 12 is 2 meters away from P, but their mutual distances would vary. If they're placed on a sphere of radius 2 meters, their mutual distances could be as small as almost 0 if they're adjacent, but I think for the purpose of this problem, we might be assuming that the 12 charges are each at a distance of 2m from P but their mutual distances are negligible or perhaps it's a simplified scenario. Hmm, but that might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps the problem only considers the potential energy from the interactions between each of the 12 and the 13th charge (the one at P), and not between the 12 themselves. That would make the problem easier, but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, the problem asks for the minimum energy. So perhaps the way to minimize the energy is to arrange the 12 charges as far away as possible from each other, but I'm not sure how that would affect the calculation. Alternatively, maybe the 12 charges are arranged in a way that their mutual distances are as large as possible, but considering their fixed position at 2m from P, their mutual distances would vary. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be solved by considering only the potential energy between the 13th charge and each of the 12 charges. Because calculating the potential energy between all 78 pairs (including the 12-12 interactions) would be complicated, especially since the 12 are arranged in three-dimensional space. If the 12 are arranged in a way that they are all on a sphere around P, their mutual distances would vary, but if their positions are such that each is equidistant from each other, that might form a regular icosahedron or something, but the problem doesn't specify, so it's probably intended to ignore the interactions between the 12 charges themselves.

So perhaps the problem only considers the potential energy between the 13th charge (at P) and each of the 12 charges at 2m. So each of the 12 contributes a certain potential energy, and their mutual interactions are ignored.

Wait, but why would the mutual interactions be ignored? Because the problem states that the system's minimum energy is being considered, and maybe those interactions contribute a positive amount to the potential energy, so to minimize the energy, perhaps the configuration should have the 12 charges as close to each other as possible, which would lower the potential energy (since negative charges would attract, but in this case, all are positive, so repel, so the mutual potential energy would be positive and would increase the total energy. So to minimize the energy, perhaps the mutual interactions are not considered, but that seems a bit unclear.

Wait, but if all the charges are positive, then the potential energy between any two is positive because like charges repel. So each pair contributes a positive amount. Therefore, if we ignore the mutual interactions between the 12, the total potential energy would be lower than if we include them, because including them would add more positive energy. Wait, no. If the mutual interactions are present, the total potential energy would be higher, since each pair adds a positive value. So if the problem is asking for the minimum energy, perhaps the configuration where the mutual interactions are minimized (like if all 12 are as close as possible to each other), but I'm not sure if that's the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the 12 charges are arranged in such a way that their mutual distances are as large as possible, but that would make the potential energy between them higher, which would increase the total energy, which might not be what we're looking for for the minimum.

Wait, maybe the problem is intended to only consider the potential energy between the 13th charge and the 12 charges, and not their mutual interactions. That would make the calculation straightforward. Let's proceed under that assumption.

So, each of the 12 charges is at a distance of 2 meters from the 13th charge. Each has a charge of 2e, so the potential energy for each pair is U = k*(2e)*(2e)/(2). Let's compute that.

Wait, but wait, the potential energy between two charges is U = (k q1 q2)/r. So for each pair, that's (k*(2e)^2)/2.

Since there are 12 such pairs, the total potential energy would be 12 * (k*(2e)^2)/2.

Let me compute the numerical value. But wait, what's the value of k? Coulomb's constant is about 8.988 x 10^9 N·m²/C². The elementary charge e is approximately 1.602 x 10^-19 coulombs.

So, let's compute each part step by step.

First, calculate (2e)^2: (2e)^2 = 4e².

So each pair's U is k * 4e² / 2 = 2 k e².

Wait, wait no: 2e * 2e = 4 e², and divided by r=2, so (4k e²)/2 = 2k e².

So each of the 12 pairs contributes 2k e². So total U is 12 * 2k e² = 24 k e².

Wait, but wait, is that correct? Let me think again. Each of the 12 charges is at a distance of 2 meters from the 13th, so each contributes (k*(2e)*(2e))/(2) = (k *4e²)/2 = 2k e². So 12 pairs give 24 k e².

Let me compute that.

k = 8.988e9 N·m²/C²
e = 1.602e-19 C

So, 24 * k * (e)^2 = 24 * 8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2.

Calculating step by step:

First, compute e squared: (1.602e-19)^2 = approx (2.566e-38) C².

Then, k * e² = 8.988e9 * 2.566e-38 = let me compute that.

8.988e9 is 8.988 x 10^9; 2.566e-38 is 2.566 x 10^-38.

Multiplying: 8.988 * 2.566 ≈ let me compute that.

8 * 2.566 = 20.528, 0.988 * 2.566 ≈ approx 2.541. So total ≈ 20.528 + 2.541 = 23.069. So 23.069 x 10^(9-38) = 23.069e-29 = 2.3069e-28.

Then, 24 * 2.3069e-28 = 24 * 2.3069 is approx 55.3656, so 55.3656e-28 = 5.53656e-27.

Wait, that's 5.53656e-27 J. Looking at the options, option C is 7.056 x 10^-27 J, option B is 2.822e-26, option A is 5.645e-26.

Wait, but wait a second. Did I make a mistake in the calculation?

Wait, let's recalculate more accurately.

Compute 24 * k * e²:

k = 8.988e9 N·m²/C²

e = 1.602e-19 C

So e squared is (1.602e-19)^2 = (1.602)^2 x 10^-38.

1.602^2 is about 2.566, so 2.566e-38.

Now, k * e² = 8.988e9 * 2.566e-38 = ?

Compute 8.988 * 2.566:

Let's compute 8 * 2.566 = 20.528

0.988 * 2.566: Let's do 0.9 * 2.566 = 2.3094; 0.08 * 2.566=0.20528 → 2.3094 +0.20528=2.51468. So 0.988 *2.566 ≈2.51468.

So 8.988 *2.566 ≈20.528 +2.51468=23.04268.

So 23.04268e(9-38) = 23.04268e-29 = 2.304268e-28.

Then 24 * 2.304268e-28 = ?

24 * 2.304268 = let's compute:

20 * 2.304268 = 46.08536

4 * 2.304268 =9.217072

Total 46.08536 +9.217072=55.302432.

So 55.302432e-28 = 5.5302432e-27 J.

So approximately 5.530e-27 J. Looking at the options, option C is 7.056e-27, which is higher. Option B is 2.822e-26, which is about five times higher. Option A is about 5.645e-26, which is about ten times higher.

Wait, none of the options match 5.53e-27. So did I make a mistake?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption. Maybe the problem includes the potential energy between the 12 charges themselves. Because that would significantly change the calculation.

So let's think again. The 12 charges are at 2 meters from P, but each other's distances could vary. If they are arranged in a way that each is as far as possible from each other, perhaps each pair is 4 meters apart (but that would be if they are diametrically opposite on a sphere of radius 2m), but in reality, arranging 12 points on a sphere would require some to be closer.

But perhaps for the sake of calculation, the problem assumes that all the 12 charges are at the same distance from each other. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is taking their mutual distances as 2 meters as well. Wait, that doesn't make sense because if two charges are on a sphere of radius 2 meters around P, the distance between them can range from 0 (if they coincide) to up to 4 meters (if they're on opposite ends).

But in reality, the 12 charges can't all be 4 meters apart from each other because you can't place 12 points on a sphere so that each is 4 meters from the others. So that's impossible. So perhaps the problem assumes that the mutual distances are 2 meters? Or perhaps it's considering the potential energy between each pair of the 12 as being at 2 meters apart, which isn't physically possible, but maybe it's an approximation.

Alternatively, perhaps the 12 charges are arranged in a regular dodecahedron or some other configuration. Hmm, but without knowing the exact arrangement, it's hard to compute their mutual distances.

Wait, maybe the problem is only considering the potential energy between the 13th charge and the 12, and not the other interactions. But then, if the answer I calculated (5.53e-27 J) isn't among the options, perhaps I did something wrong.

Wait, looking back at the problem statement: it's an isolated system, so perhaps the potential energy is calculated with all pairs. But I think I might have missed a factor in the calculation.

Wait, let me recheck the calculations. Let me compute 24 * k * e².

Wait, 24 * (8.988e9) * (1.602e-19)^2.

Wait, 1.602e-19 squared is (1.602)^2 * 1e-38 = 2.566e-38.

Multiply by 8.988e9: 2.566e-38 *8.988e9 = (2.566 *8.988) * 1e-29.

2.566 *8.988 ≈ 23.042 (as before), so 23.042e-29 = 2.3042e-28.

24 * 2.3042e-28 is 55.3008e-28 = 5.53008e-27 J.

So about 5.53e-27 J. Looking at the options again:

Options:
A) 5.645e-26
B) 2.822e-26
C) 7.056e-27
D) 122.330

None of the options match. So perhaps I made a mistake in my initial approach.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that each of the 12 charges contributes a potential energy term based on their position relative to the 13th charge, but also, the 12 charges themselves contribute a potential energy based on their mutual positions. But without knowing the exact arrangement of the 12, how can I compute that?

Alternatively, perhaps the 12 charges are all at the same point, but that would lead to an infinite potential energy, which isn't the case. So that's not possible.

Wait, maybe the 12 charges are arranged in a way that each is equidistant from each other and the 13th charge, but I don't think that's possible unless they're arranged in a specific geometric shape.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem considers the 12 charges as being at a single point, but that would make their mutual distance zero, which is impossible as their potential energy would be undefined.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let's think again.

Wait, the problem is asking for the minimum energy. The minimum energy would correspond to the configuration where the potential energy is as low as possible. Since the charges are all positive, their mutual repulsion means that the potential energy is positive and increases as the charges are closer together.

So to minimize the potential energy (make it as low as possible), the charges should be as far apart as possible. But in this setup, the 12 are constrained to stay at 2 meters from P, so their distance from P is fixed. But their mutual distances can vary depending on their arrangement on the sphere of radius 2m.

Wait, but the problem says the 12 are "constrained to stay at 2 m from point P." So their positions are fixed at 2m from P, but their exact positions on the sphere are variable. To minimize the potential energy, the 12 charges should be as far apart as possible from each other, which would minimize the repulsion between them, but since they're positive, that would minimize the potential energy contribution from their mutual interactions.

Wait, but how does that affect the total potential energy? Because each pair of the 12 contributes a positive amount, so arranging them to be as far apart as possible would minimize each of their contributions, leading to a lower total potential energy.

But without knowing the exact arrangement, it's hard to compute. So perhaps the problem is intended to ignore the mutual interactions between the 12 charges and only consider the potential energy between each of them and the 13th charge at P.

If that's the case, then the total potential energy would be 12 * (k*(2e)^2)/2 = 12*(4k e²)/2 = 12*(2k e²) = 24 k e², which is about 5.53e-27 J as before. But the options don't have this number.

Wait, looking at option C: 7.056e-27. Maybe I messed up a calculation step.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of 24 k e². Let me recalculate it precisely.

Compute each step:

Compute e squared: (1.602e-19)^2 = (1.602)^2 * 1e-38 = 2.566e-38 C².

Compute k * e²: 8.988e9 * 2.566e-38.

8.988e9 = 8.988 * 1e9.

2.566e-38 = 2.566 * 1e-38.

Multiply 8.988 * 2.566:

Let's compute 8 * 2.566 = 20.528.

0.988 * 2.566: 0.9 * 2.566 =2.3094, 0.08 *2.566=0.20528 → 2.3094+0.20528=2.51468.

So total 20.528 + 2.51468 =23.04268.

So 8.988e9 * 2.566e-38 =23.04268e-29 → 2.304268e-28 J.

Now multiply by 24: 24 * 2.304268e-28 = (24 * 2.304268) e-28.

24 * 2.304268 = let's compute:

20 *2.304268 =46.08536

4 *2.304268=9.217072

Total 46.08536 +9.217072 =55.302432.

So 55.302432e-28 =5.5302432e-27 J.

So approximately 5.53e-27 J.

Looking at the options, the closest is option C:7.056e-27, but that's about 28% higher. Hmm. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula for potential energy. Because in a system of charges, the potential energy is the sum over all unique pairs, and each pair is considered once. So for the 13 charges, including the 13th, the potential energy would include the interactions between the 12 and the 13th, and between the 12 themselves.

Wait, but in the initial approach, I only considered the 12-13th interactions, but not the 12-12 interactions. So if I include those, the total energy would be higher, which would make the option not match. But the problem asks for the minimum energy, so perhaps the mutual interactions are arranged such that they contribute the least possible energy, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the distance. Let me check the distance again. The problem states that the 12 charges are at 2 m from P, so each is 2 m from P. So when considering the potential energy between charge 13 (at P) and any of the 12, r is 2 m.

But when considering the potential energy between any two of the 12 charges, their distance from each other is not given. So perhaps the problem is assuming that all the 12 charges are at a mutual distance of 2 m as well, which is not possible in reality, but perhaps it's an approximation.

If that's the case, then the number of pairs would be C(12,2) =66 pairs. Each pair contributes (k*(2e)^2)/2 = same as before.

Wait, no, if the mutual distance is 2m, then each pair's U is (k*(2e)^2)/2.

So total U for 12-12 interactions would be 66*(k*(4e²)/2) = 66*(2k e²) = 132 k e².

And the U for 13-12 interactions is 12*(2k e²) =24 k e².

So total U would be (132 +24) k e² =156 k e².

Which is 156 * (8.988e9)*(1.602e-19)^2.

Wait, that would be 156 * 2.3042e-28 = 359.155e-28 =3.59155e-26 J.

So approximately 3.59e-26 J.

Looking at the options, option A is 5.645e-26 and option B is 2.822e-26, which is close to 3.59e-26? No, it's about 3.59e-26, which isn't an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual distances of the 12 charges are considered to be much larger, so their potential energy is negligible. But that would require that they are very far apart, but that's not stated in the problem.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy from the 13th charge with the 12, and the mutual between the 12 are to be considered, but in a way that each of the 12 is at 2 meters from every other. Wait, that's impossible because in 3D space, you can't have 12 points all at the same distance from each other on a sphere of radius 2. But perhaps the problem makes an approximation, treating the 12 charges as being on the surface of a sphere and their mutual distance as about 2 meters. But that's not possible as the maximum distance between two points on a 2m sphere is 4m.

Wait, perhaps the mutual distances between the 12 charges are 4 meters apart on average. But that complicates the calculation, and without knowing the exact configuration, it's hard.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that each of the 12 charges is at a distance of 2 meters from every other, which would require them all being at the same point, which is impossible. So that's not feasible.

This is getting complicated. Let me think differently.

Wait, the problem states that the 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2 m from P. So their positions are fixed at 2 m from P, but nothing is said about their mutual positions. So perhaps the problem is intended to ignore the potential energy between the 12 charges, and only consider the potential energy between each of them and the 13th charge at P.

In that case, the total U is 12 * (k*(2e)^2)/2 =24 k e², which is 5.53e-27 J, as before.

But none of the options match. So perhaps I'm missing something. Let me check the options again.

Wait, option C is 7.056e-27. Let me compute what value of 24 k e² would give that.

Compute 7.056e-27 = 24 *k * e².

So, 7.056e-27 /24 = k * e².

7.056e-27 /24 = 2.94e-28.

But k * e² is 8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2.

Earlier calculation gave that as 2.304e-28.

Hmm, 2.94e-28 is about 1.277 times 2.304e-28.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the number of pairs. Because earlier I thought 12 charges each contribute a pair with the 13th, so 12 pairs. But wait, the 13th charge is fixed at P, and the 12 are at 2m. So each of the 12 contributes a pair with the 13th, so 12 pairs. But each pair is counted once.

So no, 12 pairs is correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is to compute the potential energy between the 13 charges, considering all pairs. Let's compute that.

Total number of pairs is C(13,2) = 78.

Each pair contributes (k*(2e)^2)/r, where r is the distance between them.

But for the 12 charges, their distance from the 13th is 2m, but the distance between any two of the 12 could vary. But without knowing their arrangement, perhaps the problem assumes that all 12 are at the same distance from each other as from the 13th charge. But that's not possible, as they are on a sphere of radius 2m, so their mutual distances are at most 4m, but more typically less than that.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the 12 charges are uniformly distributed on a sphere of radius 2m, and their mutual distances are such that each pair is at the same distance. But that's only possible for certain numbers of charges, like 4 (tetrahedron), 6 (octahedron), etc. For 12, perhaps a cuboctahedron arrangement, but I'm not sure.

Wait, if the 12 charges are arranged on a regular icosahedron around P, each of their mutual distances would be the same. So let's compute the edge length of a regular icosahedron inscribed in a sphere of radius 2m.

The formula for the edge length a of a regular icosahedron inscribed in a sphere of radius r is a = r * sqrt(10/(3)) * (1 + sqrt(5)) )^{-1}.

Wait, not sure about that. Alternatively, the formula for the radius in terms of edge length a is r = a * (sqrt( (5 + sqrt(5))/8 )) * (1 + sqrt(5)) )? I might be getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the distance between two adjacent vertices on a regular icosahedron. For a regular icosahedron with edge length a, the radius (distance from center to vertex) R is R = a * sqrt( (5 + sqrt(5))/8 ) * (1 + sqrt(5)) ).

Wait, maybe it's easier to look up the formula. For a regular icosahedron, the radius R is related to edge length a by R = a * sqrt(φ²) where φ is the golden ratio, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps R ≈ a * 0.951056...

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to look up the formula. The formula for the radius R of a regular icosahedron with edge length a is R = (a/2) * sqrt(φ² +1 ), where φ is the golden ratio (1.618...). But perhaps I'm making this more complicated than it needs to be.

Alternatively, perhaps the 12 charges are arranged in a cube around P. Wait, no, a cube has 8 vertices, so that's not 12. Alternatively, maybe they're arranged on the vertices of a regular octahedron, which has 6 vertices, so that's not 12 either. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the 12 charges are arranged in a way that they are all at 2m from P and each other. But in reality, you can't have more than 6 points on a sphere where each is equidistant from every other.

So perhaps the problem is assuming that the mutual distances between the 12 charges are 2m as well, but that's geometrically impossible. So maybe the problem is making an approximation, perhaps treating the mutual distance as 2m, leading to each pair contributing (k*(2e)^2)/2.

But if that's the case, the number of pairs among the 12 is C(12,2)=66, so their contribution is 66 * (k*(4e²)/2) =66*(2k e²)=132 k e².

And the contribution from the 12-13th pairs is 12*(2k e²) = 24 k e².

Total U = (132 +24) k e²=156 k e².

As before, 156 * (8.988e9) * (1.602e-19)^2.

Wait, let's compute that. 1.602e-19 squared is 2.566e-38.

8.988e9 * 2.566e-38 = 2.304e-28 (as before).

156 * 2.304e-28 = 359.184e-28 =3.59184e-26 J.

Looking at the options, the closest is option A (5.645e-26) and option B (2.822e-26). So 3.59e-26 isn't matching, so perhaps this approach is wrong.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the potential energy between each of the 12 and the 13th charge, but the 12 are arranged in such a way that their mutual potential energy is zero. Which isn't possible, because all are positive charges, so their mutual PE is positive.

Wait, perhaps the problem is not considering the mutual interactions because the 12 are fixed in space, so their arrangement doesn't change, and hence their potential energy is considered a constant and not part of the calculation for the minimum energy.

But the question says "the minimum energy of this system," so perhaps the mutual interactions are considered, and the minimum is achieved when the 12 charges are as far apart as possible, hence minimizing their mutual potential energy (since each pair's contribution is positive, making the total as small as possible).

But without knowing the exact arrangement, it's hard to compute. So perhaps the problem is intended to ignore the mutual interactions.

So, going back to the initial calculation: the potential energy is 24 k e² =5.53e-27 J.

But the options don't include that. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a different value for Coulomb's constant. For example, sometimes k is approximated as 9e9 N·m²/C².

Let's recalculate using k=9e9.

So, 24 *9e9 * (1.602e-19)^2.

Compute e squared: (1.602e-19)^2 =2.566e-38.

k *e²=9e9 *2.566e-38 = 2.3094e-28.

Multiply by 24: 24 *2.3094e-28 =55.4256e-28 =5.54256e-27 J.

Still about 5.54e-27 J. The options don't have this.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the potential energy of the 13th charge due to the 12 charges, but not the potential energy of the 12 charges among themselves. So the total potential energy is just the sum of the potentials from each 12th charge on the 13th.

Wait, but the potential energy of a system is the sum of the potential energies of each pair, not the sum of potentials. So the 13th charge contributes to the potential at each of the 12 charges, but each pair is counted once.

So perhaps the calculation I did earlier is correct, but the answer isn't among the options.

Wait, looking at the options again, option C is 7.056e-27 J. Let me see what number of pairs would give that.

7.056e-27 J = n * (k*(2e)^2)/2.

n is the number of pairs.

So, n = (7.056e-27)/( (k*(4e²)/2 )) )

n = (7.056e-27) / ( (8.988e9)*(4*(1.602e-19)^2)/2 )

Compute denominator:

4e² =4*(2.566e-38) =1.0264e-37.

Multiply by k:8.988e9 *1.0264e-37 =9.241e-28.

Divide by 2:4.6205e-28.

So, denominator is 4.6205e-28.

Now, n=7.056e-27 /4.6205e-28 ≈15.266.

So n≈15.266.

But the number of pairs should be an integer. 15.266 is close to 15.27, which suggests perhaps 15 or 16 pairs.

But in our initial setup, the number of pairs between the 12 and the 13th is 12, which leads to n=12. So 12 pairs give 5.53e-27, but 15.27 pairs would give 7.05e-27. So perhaps the problem is considering 15 pairs. But 15 pairs would imply that the 13th charge is interacting with 15 others, which is not the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps I messed up the calculation somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the 13th charge as being influenced by the other 12, but the other 12 have their mutual interactions which are contributing to the total potential energy.

But without knowing their mutual distances, it's impossible to compute.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different formula, such as the electric potential energy being (k q^2)/(r), but considering each charge's own potential. Wait, no, that's not how potential energy works. Each pair contributes once.

Wait, maybe the problem is using a different approach, like considering the work done to assemble the charges. The potential energy of the system is the work done to bring each charge from infinity to its position, considering the potential due to the charges already in place.

So, starting with the 13th charge at P. Then, bringing each of the 12 charges from infinity to their positions, each at 2m from P. So for each charge, the potential at P due to the previous charges is zero (since the first one is placed after the 13th, but wait, the 13th is fixed at P.

Wait, the 13th charge is fixed at P. Then, the first of the 12 charges is brought from infinity to 2m away. The potential at that point due to the 13th charge is V = k*(2e)/2 =k e.

So the work done (which is the potential energy added) is q * V = (2e) * (k e / 2) )= (2e)(k e)/(2) )= k e².

Similarly, bringing the second charge to 2m away. Now, the potential at that point is V = k*(2e)/2 + k*(2e)/2 (from the first charge placed). So V = k e +k e = 2k e.

So the work done is (2e) * 2k e =4k e².

Wait, but wait, each time a new charge is placed, the potential at the new position is due to all the previously placed charges (including the 13th at P).

So the first charge: placed at 2m from P. The potential at that point due to the 13th charge is V1 = k*(2e)/2 =k e.

Work done: q * V1 = (2e) * (k e) = 2k e².

Wait, but earlier I thought it was k e². Hmm.

Wait, let me think again. The 13th charge is at P, fixed. Then we bring the first of the 12 charges from infinity to 2m from P.

At that point, the potential due to the 13th charge is V1 = k*(2e)/2 = k e.

So the potential energy added when placing this charge is q * V1 = (2e) * (k e) )= 2k e².

Now, the second charge is brought to another point 2m from P. The potential at that point now includes the contribution from the 13th charge and the first charge.

Potential V2 = k*(2e)/2 (from 13th) + k*(2e)/distance between the two charges.

Wait, the distance between the two charges is, let's say, r. But without knowing their arrangement, it's hard to say. If they're on a sphere, the minimum distance is zero, but in reality, for minimum energy, we arrange them to be as far apart as possible, which would minimize the potential energy added.

Wait, but perhaps the problem assumes that each new charge is placed such that it's at a distance of 2m from all previously placed charges. But that's impossible beyond the first charge. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is assuming that the mutual distances are 2m, but as discussed earlier, that's not feasible.

This approach is getting too complicated, and I'm not making progress. Maybe I should look for another approach or consider that the correct answer is option C, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different formula. Wait, perhaps the potential energy is calculated as (k q^2) / r, but multiplied by the number of charges. So for each of the 12 charges, the potential energy due to the 13th is (k*(2e)^2)/(2) * 12.

Wait, that would be 12 * (k *4e²)/2 = 24 k e², which is the same as before, leading to 5.53e-27 J, which isn't an option.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the potential energy between the 13th charge and each of the 12, but each pair is considered twice, so the total is 24 k e², but that doesn't change anything.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in using the formula. Let me check Coulomb's law. The potential energy between two point charges is U = k q1 q2 / r. So for q1 = q2 = 2e, U = k*(2e)^2 / r.

So for each of the 12 pairs, U = (k *4e²) / 2 = 2 k e².

Total for 12 pairs: 12 * 2 k e² =24 k e².

So the same as before.

But the options don't have this. Hmm. Maybe the problem is using a different charge value. Oh wait, the charge is 2e, so 2 times elementary charge. Wait, yes, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the potential energy should be calculated as the sum of all pairs, including the 12 charges among themselves. But without their mutual distances, I can't compute that. So perhaps the problem is expecting us to only consider the 12-13th pairs, leading to 5.53e-27 J, but that's not in the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different value for e, such as e=1.6e-19 C. Let me try that.

e=1.6e-19 C.

Then e²=2.56e-38 C².

k=8.988e9.

So, 24 *8.988e9 * 2.56e-38.

Compute 8.988e9 *2.56e-38 = (8.988 *2.56) e-29.

8.988 *2.56 ≈23.07.

So 23.07e-29 =2.307e-28.

Multiply by 24: 2.307e-28 *24 =55.368e-28 =5.5368e-27 J.

Still the same as before.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Maybe the correct answer is option C, 7.056e-27, but I don't see how.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of pairs. If there are 13 charges, the number of pairs is C(13,2)=78.

But if all r are 2m, then each pair contributes (k*(2e)^2)/2=2k e².

So total U =78 *2k e²=156 k e².

Which is 156 *8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2.

Compute:

1.602^2=2.566e-38.

8.988e9 *2.566e-38=2.304e-28.

156 *2.304e-28 =359.0e-28=3.590e-26 J.

Which is approximately 3.59e-26 J.

Looking at the options, the closest is option A:5.645e-26, which is higher.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering each of the 12 charges to interact at a distance of 4 m from each other, which would be the maximum possible on a 2m sphere.

So for the 12 charges, each pair is 4m apart. So their U would be (k*(2e)^2)/4= (4k e²)/4= k e².

Number of pairs among the 12 is 66, so their contribution is 66 *k e².

Plus the 12-13th pairs:12 * (2k e²) =24 k e².

Total U= (66 +24) *k e²=90 k e².

Compute 90 *8.988e9 *(1.602e-19)^2.

Again, same as before, 8.988e9 *2.566e-38=2.304e-28.

90 *2.304e-28=207.36e-28=2.0736e-26 J.

Looking at the options, option B is 2.822e-26. Close, but not exact.

Wait, 2.0736e-26 is about 2.07e-26, which isn't an option. Option B is 2.822e-26, which is about 35% higher.

Hmm. I'm not making progress here. Perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options, but that can't be. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the problem is considering the potential energy as the sum of each charge's potential due to all others, but each term is considered individually. So for each charge, you calculate the potential due to all others, multiply by the charge, and sum all.

But that's essentially what we've been doing.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using e as the elementary charge, not 2e. No, the question says each charge is 2e.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the potential energy as the work done to assemble the system, which would require considering the order in which charges are placed and the potential at each step.

So, let's model that. The 13th charge is fixed at P. Then, we bring each of the 12 charges one by one from infinity to their positions, each 2m from P.

At each step, the potential at the new position is due to the 13th charge and the previously placed charges.

The first charge: brought to 2m. The potential at that point is V = k*(2e)/2 =k e.

Work done (energy added) is (2e) * V = 2e * k e = 2k e².

Second charge: placed at another point 2m from P. The potential at that point now includes the 13th charge (V13 =k e) and the first charge (V1 =k*(2e)/r, where r is the distance between the first and second charges).

But without knowing r, we can't proceed. However, to minimize the total energy, we'd arrange the charges as far apart as possible, making r as large as possible. The maximum possible r is 4m (if placed diametrically opposite on the sphere). But in reality, for 12 charges, you can't have all pairs separated by 4m. So perhaps the problem is assuming that each new charge is placed at a distance of 4m from all previously placed charges, which is impossible beyond the second charge.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is assuming that the mutual distances are 2m, which isn't possible, but let's proceed with that assumption.

So, for each new charge, the potential due to the existing charges (including the 13th) is k e (from the 13th) plus k e (from each of the previous charges, assuming they're all 2m apart).

But this approach is getting too complicated, and I'm not making progress.

Given the time I've spent, perhaps I should conclude that the correct answer is option C:7.056e-27 J, but I'm not sure how. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to consider only the potential energy between the 12 charges and the 13th, leading to 5.53e-27 J, but that's not an option. So I'm stuck.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves calculating the minimum energy of a system consisting of 13 identical particles, each with a charge of \( 2e \) and negligible mass. Twelve of these charges are constrained to stay at a distance of 2 meters from a point \( P \), while the 13th charge is fixed at \( P \). The energy of the system is assumed to be purely electrostatic potential energy.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Potential Energy Formula**:  
   The electrostatic potential energy between two charges \( q_1 \) and \( q_2 \) separated by a distance \( r \) is given by:  
   \[
   U = \frac{k \cdot q_1 \cdot q_2}{r}
   \]  
   where \( k \) is Coulomb's constant (\( 8.988 \times 10^9 \, \text{N·m}^2/\text{C}^2 \)).

2. **Charges and Distances**:  
   Each charge is \( 2e \), where \( e \) is the elementary charge (\( 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C} \)). The 12 charges are at a fixed distance of 2 meters from the 13th charge at \( P \). The mutual distances between the 12 charges are not explicitly provided, leading to ambiguity in their contribution to the total potential energy.

3. **Assumption for Simplification**:  
   To proceed, the mutual interactions between the 12 charges are likely ignored, as their exact arrangement and distances are not specified. This simplifies the calculation to consider only the potential energy between the 12 charges and the 13th charge at \( P \).

4. **Calculation of Potential Energy**:  
   Each of the 12 charges contributes a potential energy of:  
   \[
   U_{\text{pair}} = \frac{k \cdot (2e)^2}{2} = \frac{k \cdot 4e^2}{2} = 2k e^2
   \]  
   Since there are 12 such pairs, the total potential energy is:  
   \[
   U_{\text{total}} = 12 \cdot U_{\text{pair}} = 12 \cdot 2k e^2 = 24k e^2
   \]  
   Substituting the values of \( k \) and \( e \):  
   \[
   e^2 = (1.602 \times 10^{-19})^2 = 2.566 \times 10^{-38} \, \text{C}^2
   \]  
   \[
   k \cdot e^2 = (8.988 \times 10^9) \cdot (2.566 \times 10^{-38}) = 2.304 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{J}
   \]  
   \[
   U_{\text{total}} = 24 \cdot (2.304 \times 10^{-28}) = 5.530 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J}
   \]

5. **Comparison with Options**:  
   The calculated value of \( 5.53 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J} \) does not match any of the provided options. The closest option is \( 7.056 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J} \), which is approximately 28% higher. This discrepancy suggests either a miscalculation or an issue with the problem's assumptions.

6. **Conclusion**:  
   Given the ambiguity in the mutual interactions between the 12 charges and the lack of explicit arrangement details, the most reasonable assumption is to consider only the potential energy between the 12 charges and the 13th charge. Based on the calculations, the energy is approximately \( 5.53 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J} \), but since this value is not listed, the closest option is selected.
