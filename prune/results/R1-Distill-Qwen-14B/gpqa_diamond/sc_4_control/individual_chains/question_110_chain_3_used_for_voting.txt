Okay, so I've got this question about stars and the spectrographs that can detect them. Hmm, let me think through this step by step. 

The question is asking which stars can be detected by both ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. I remember that ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than 17th magnitude in V, and HIRES can go down to 16th magnitude. Wait, no, the question says that with ESPRESSO, stars brighter than 17 mag can be observed, so that means magnitude less than or equal to 17? Because in astronomy, lower magnitudes are brighter. So, higher numbers are fainter. So, the cutoff is V magnitude <=17 for ESPRESSO, and for HIRES, V mag <=16.

So each star's apparent V magnitude determines whether it's observable by each instrument. But wait, some stars have absolute magnitudes and distances given, so I might need to calculate their apparent magnitudes.

Let's go through each star one by one.

Star1: RA 15 deg, DEC -75, absolute V mag 15.5, distance 10 pc. So apparent magnitude (m) can be calculated using the distance modulus: m = M + 5 log10(d/10), where d is in parsecs.

So M is 15.5, d is 10. So log10(10/10)=0. So m =15.5 +0 =15.5. So apparent mag is 15.5.

Now, check if this is within both instruments' limits.

HIRES can observe up to 16 mag. 15.5 is less than 16, so yes for HIRES. For ESPRESSO, it's 17. 15.5 is less than 17, so yes. So Star1 can be detected by both. But wait, looking at the options, option D is Star1 and Star4. So I'll hold onto that thought.

Star2: RA 30, DEC55, apparent V mag 16.5, distance 5 pc. So the apparent is given; no need to calculate. So m=16.5.

HIRES can do up to 16 mag. So Star2 is at 16.5, which is fainter than 16, so HIRES can't observe it. ESPRESSO can do up to 17; 16.5 is less than 17, so ESPRESSO can. But since it's only detected by ESPRESSO, not both, it's not a candidate for the correct answer.

Star3: RA 11h, DEC48, apparent V mag 15.5, E(B-V)=0.6, distance 15 pc. Wait, but the apparent mag given is already corrected for extinction? Or is that the observed mag?

Wait, no. The question says, Star3 has apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag, and E(B-V)=0.6. Oh, but wait, the note says that the total absorption in V is related to E(B-V) with a coefficient of 3.1. So, extinction A_V = 3.1 * E(B-V). So for Star3, A_V =3.1 *0.6=1.86 mag.

So the apparent magnitude as observed would be the intrinsic plus extinction. Wait, no, wait, in astronomy, the observed magnitude is m = M + 5 log10(d/10) + A_V. Or wait, is it that the apparent magnitude is the intrinsic plus the extinction? Because extinction makes stars appear fainter (higher magnitude). So if the apparent magnitude is given as 15.5, but that's without considering the extinction, or is it including it?

Wait, the problem states that Star3 has an apparent V magnitude of 15.5, and E(B-V)=0.6. So perhaps the 15.5 is the observed (corrected) magnitude, and the question is about extinction. Or maybe the 15.5 is the intrinsic, and after extinction, it's higher. Hmm, I'm a bit confused.

Wait, the note says that the total absorption in the V band is related to E(B-V) with a coefficient 3.1. So the extinction A_V is 3.1 * E(B-V). So for Star3, A_V=1.86 mag. So the observed apparent magnitude would be m_observed = m_intrinsic + A_V.

Wait, but the problem says Star3's apparent V mag is 15.5, but that might already be affected by extinction. Or is that the absolute magnitude? No, Star3's given data: it has an apparent magnitude of 15.5, and E(B-V)=0.6, but I think that the apparent magnitude given is the observed magnitude, which already includes extinction. So perhaps we don't need to adjust it further. But that's not clear.

Alternatively, perhaps the apparent magnitude given is the 'intrinsic' value, and the extinction would increase it. Let me think. When you observe a star through interstellar medium, it makes it appear dimmer (higher magnitude). So the observed apparent magnitude is m_observed = m_intrinsic + A_V.

Wait, but Star3's apparent magnitude is 15.5, which is already the observed value. So perhaps it's already corrected for extinction. So maybe the 15.5 is after extinction. So that would be the m we use.

Alternatively, perhaps the given apparent magnitude is the uncorrected one, and we have to add the extinction to get the actual observed magnitude.

Wait, the problem says, "apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag, E(B-V)=0.6 mag". Hmm. Let me think again. The question gives the star's apparent magnitude as 15.5, but the extinction affects the observed magnitude. So perhaps the 15.5 is the intrinsic, and the observed would be higher. Or is the 15.5 the observed, which has been corrected for extinction?

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me clarify. The problem says, "apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag and located at 15 pc distance from us. Note that the total absorption in the V band is related to the color excess in B-V with a coefficient equal to 3.1."

So the note is about the relationship between E(B-V) and A_V. So if E(B-V) is 0.6, then A_V is 3.1 * 0.6 =1.86 mag.

But in the case of Star3, if the given apparent magnitude is 15.5, is that the observed (corrected) magnitude, or the intrinsic (before extinction) magnitude?

Wait, the apparent magnitude is the observed. Because apparent magnitude is what you measure. So extinction would increase the apparent magnitude. So if the star's light is dimmed by extinction, the observed apparent magnitude is higher (fainter) than the intrinsic.

So Star3's apparent magnitude is given as 15.5 mag. But due to extinction, that's the observed value. Wait no, that's not right. Wait, the observed apparent magnitude would be the intrinsic plus extinction. Because the star is dimmer, so higher magnitude.

Wait, no. Let's think. If a star is at distance d, without extinction, its apparent magnitude is m = M + 5 log10(d/10). Then, with extinction (A_V), the apparent magnitude becomes m_observed = m_intrinsic + A_V.

So if the problem says that Star3's apparent magnitude is 15.5, and E(B-V)=0.6, then the A_V is 1.86. Then the observed m is 15.5, but what is the intrinsic m?

Wait, that doesn't make sense. Because if the observed m is 15.5, and A_V is 1.86, then the intrinsic m would be m_observed - A_V = 15.5 -1.86 =13.64. But that's only possible if the extinction is subtracted.

Alternatively, perhaps the given apparent magnitude is the intrinsic (without extinction), so the observed would be m = 15.5 +1.86=17.36.

Wait, this is confusing. Let me think about what the problem is saying.

The problem says, Star3's apparent V magnitude is 15.5. So that's the observed magnitude. But it also has E(B-V) of 0.6. So the extinction A_V is 3.1 *0.6=1.86.

So the observed magnitude is m_observed = m_intrinsic + A_V. So m_intrinsic = m_observed - A_V.

Wait, no. Because A_V is the amount by which the magnitude increases (becomes fainter). So m_observed = m_intrinsic + A_V.

So if m_observed is 15.5, then m_intrinsic =15.5 -1.86=13.64.

But wait, why would we calculate m_intrinsic for Star3? Because Star3's given m is already the observed. But I'm not sure why that's necessary.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that Star3's apparent magnitude is the intrinsic, so after adding the extinction, it's m_observed=15.5+1.86=17.36. So which is it?

Alternatively, perhaps the given apparent magnitude is the corrected (extinction subtracted) value. So the actual observed magnitude is higher.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let's approach it another way. For Star3, the apparent magnitude provided is 15.5, E(B-V)=0.6.

The question is whether Star3 is visible to both spectrographs. So for that, we need the observed apparent magnitude. Because the instruments have limits on the apparent magnitude.

So, for Star3, the observed m is 15.5. Then, since A_V is 1.86, the extinction makes it appear dimmer. So the observed m is 15.5 + 1.86 =17.36? Or is the observed m 15.5, which includes the extinction, so we don't need to adjust it again.

Wait, perhaps the 15.5 is the apparent magnitude, already including the extinction. So in that case, the observed m is 15.5. Then, we can proceed.

Wait, but the problem says, "apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag" without any mention of extinction. So perhaps that's the observed, corrected magnitude. Or perhaps not. Hmm, this is tricky.

Alternatively, perhaps the given apparent magnitude is the 'intrinsic' (without extinction), so the observed would be 15.5 +1.86 =17.36.

Wait, let's approach it systematically. The problem provides Star3's data: apparent V mag 15.5, E(B-V)=0.6. So the total absorption in V band is A_V=3.1 *0.6=1.86.

So the apparent magnitude without extinction would be 15.5 -1.86 =13.64. But that doesn't make sense because the observed magnitude includes extinction.

Wait, perhaps the given m is the intrinsic, so the observed (what we see) is m + A_V =15.5 +1.86=17.36.

But if that's the case, the observed apparent magnitude is 17.36. 

So, for HIRES, which can go up to 16 mag, 17.36 is too faint. So HIRES can't detect it. ESPRESSO can go up to 17, so 17.36 is a bit beyond. So Star3 can't be detected by either.

Wait, but that can't be right because Star3's given m is 15.5, but perhaps that's without considering extinction. So the actual m would be higher.

Alternatively, perhaps the given m is the observed (after considering extinction), so we don't need to adjust it. So if m is 15.5, and A_V is 1.86, that would mean the star is intrinsically brighter than that. But for the purpose of detection, the observed m is 15.5.

So in that case, Star3's observed m is 15.5, which is below both 16 and 17. So both can detect it.

Wait, but why would the problem give E(B-V) if the apparent magnitude is already given? Unless perhaps the question is that the given apparent magnitude is the intrinsic, and we have to compute the observed.

So perhaps the correct approach is:

For Star3, the apparent magnitude (without extinction) is 15.5. But because of extinction, the observed magnitude is m =15.5 + A_V=15.5 + 1.86=17.36.

So the observed apparent magnitude is 17.36, which is beyond both ESPRESSO (cut-off 17) and HIRES (cut-off 16). So Star3 is not detectable by either.

Wait, but that contradicts the given data. Alternatively, perhaps the problem provides the apparent magnitude already corrected for extinction, so m_observed=15.5, which is the correct value.

In that case, Star3's m is 15.5, which is detectable by both instruments.

But wait, how do I know whether the given m is the corrected or uncorrected (intrinsic) value? The problem doesn't specify. Hmm, this is a problem.

Wait, the question is a bit ambiguous. Let me check the question again.

Question says: "Star3 - RA = 11h and DEC = 48 deg, apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag, E(B-V) = 0.6 mag and located at 15 pc distance from us."

So the apparent V magnitude is given as 15.5. The E(B-V) is given, and the note says that the total absorption in V band is related to E(B-V) with a coefficient of 3.1. So A_V=3.1 * E(B-V) =1.86.

So, the star's light is absorbed by 1.86 mag, so the observed apparent magnitude (m_obs) is the intrinsic apparent magnitude (m_intrinsic) plus 1.86.

Wait, but the given m is 15.5. Is it m_obs or m_intrinsic?

In astronomy, when you report an apparent magnitude, you normally report it as observed, which includes extinction. So if the given m is 15.5, that's the observed. So in that case, the extinction doesn't affect it further.

But wait, no. Because E(B-V) is the color excess, which is the observed color minus the intrinsic color. So if the star's observed color is B-V, then E(B-V)= (B-V)_observed - (B-V)_intrinsic.

So, in that case, the extinction affects the V and B magnitudes differently. But for the purpose of this problem, it's given that the total absorption in the V band is A_V=3.1 * E(B-V). So the apparent V magnitude is m_obs = m_intrinsic + A_V.

But if the problem states that the apparent V magnitude is 15.5, that's the observed (after extinction), so m_obs=15.5.

Wait, but then why is E(B-V) given? Unless it's a hint that the star is actually brighter than it appears. Because if the star's light is dimmed by extinction, its intrinsic brightness is higher, so m_intrinsic = m_obs - A_V =15.5 -1.86=13.64. But unless we need to use that to calculate something else, like whether it's visible.

But for the purpose of this question, perhaps the given apparent magnitude is the observed one, so we don't need to adjust it. So Star3's apparent magnitude is 15.5. Both spectrographs can observe it because 15.5 is below 16 and 17. So Star3 is observable by both.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me proceed to the next stars and see.

Star4: RA 85, DEC -48, absolute V mag 15.5, E(B-V)=0.4, located at 10 pc.

So, first, calculate the apparent magnitude without extinction: m = M +5 log10(d/10) =15.5 +5*(1) =20.5? Wait, no. Wait, d is 10 pc, so log10(1)=0, so m=15.5 +0=15.5.

Then, A_V=3.1 *0.4=1.24.

So the observed apparent magnitude is m_observed =15.5 +1.24=16.74.

So m_obs=16.74.

HIRES can observe up to 16 mag. So 16.74 is beyond that. So HIRES can't detect it. ESPRESSO can go up to 17, so 16.74 is under 17, so ESPRESSO can detect it.

So Star4 is detectable only by ESPRESSO, not both.

Star5: RA 10h, DEC 60, absolute V mag 16.5, distance 5pc.

m = M +5 log10(5/10) =16.5 +5 log10(0.5)=16.5 +5*(-0.3010)≈16.5 -1.505 =14.995 ≈15.0.

So apparent mag ≈15.0. So both HIRES (<=16) and ESPRESSO (<=17) can detect it. So Star5 is observable by both.

Wait, but the options don't have Star5 being the correct answer. Let me check the options.

The options are:

A) Star4 and Star5 → Star4: m_obs=16.74 → not detected by HIRES. So A is incorrect.

B) Star3 and Star5 → If Star3 is observable by both, then yes.

C) Star2 and Star3 → Star2's m is 16.5, which is above HIRES' limit.

D) Star1 and Star4 → Star1: m=15.5 → both can detect. Star4: m_obs=16.74, which ESPRESSO can detect, but not HIRES. So D is incorrect.

So from my analysis, Star1 and Star5 are both detectable by both instruments.

Wait, let me recheck Star3. If Star3's observed m is 15.5, then both can detect it. So Star3 and Star5 are both detectable.

But earlier analysis of Star3's m_obs is 15.5. So Star3 can be detected by both.

Wait, but earlier I had a confusion about whether the given m is observed or intrinsic. Let me reevaluate.

Star3: apparent V mag 15.5, E(B-V)=0.6 → A_V=1.86.

If the given m is the observed (corrected), then m_obs=15.5, which is acceptable for both spectrographs (<=16 and <=17).

If the given m is the intrinsic (without extinction), then m_obs=15.5+1.86=17.36, which is above the limits of both (since HIRES can do 16, ESPRESSO 17), so m=17.36 is too faint for both.

But how can I know which is the case? The problem says, "apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag". In astronomy, apparent magnitude is the observed value, which includes all effects like extinction. So Star3's m is 15.5, observed. So it's within both limits. So Star3 can be detected by both.

So Star3 and Star5 are both detectable. So which option includes both?

Looking at the options:

Option B: Star3 and Star5 → Yes.

Option D: Star1 and Star4 → Star1 is detectable, but Star4 isn't.

So the correct answer would be option B: Star3 and Star5.

Wait, but earlier I thought Star5's m is 15.0, which is observable by both.

Wait, let me double-check Star5's m:

M=16.5, distance 5 pc.

m = M +5 log10(5/10) =16.5 +5 log(0.5)=16.5 +5*(-0.301)=16.5 -1.505=14.995, approx 15.0.

So yes, both can detect it.

So the stars that can be detected by both are Star3 (m=15.5) and Star5 (m=15.0).

So the correct option is B: Star3 and Star5.

Wait, but earlier Star3's observed m is 15.5, which is okay, Star5's m is 15.0, also okay.

So the correct answer is option B.

But wait, looking back, I thought Star1 and Star5 are both detectable. But according to the options, the only options involving Star3 and Star5 are option B. So I think that's the correct choice.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at the Paranal Observatory and the HIRES spectrograph at the Keck Observatory, we analyze the apparent V magnitudes of the stars and compare them to the detection limits of the instruments. ESPRESSO can observe stars with apparent V magnitudes up to 17, while HIRES can observe stars up to 16. Each star's apparent magnitude is calculated or provided, and extinction effects are considered where necessary.

### Analysis of Each Star:

1. **Star1**:  
   - Absolute V magnitude \( M = 15.5 \), distance \( d = 10 \, \text{pc} \).  
   - Apparent magnitude:  
     \[

     \]  
   - Apparent magnitude \( m = 15.5 \), which is within both ESPRESSO (\( \leq 17 \)) and HIRES (\( \leq 16 \)) limits.  
   - **Detectable by both instruments.**

2. **Star2**:  
   - Apparent V magnitude \( m = 16.5 \), distance \( d = 5 \, \text{pc} \).  
   - Apparent magnitude \( m = 16.5 \), which exceeds HIRES's limit (\( \leq 16 \)) but is within ESPRESSO's limit (\( \leq 17 \)).  
   - **Detectable only by ESPRESSO.**

3. **Star3**:  
   - Apparent V magnitude \( m = 15.5 \), \( E(B-V) = 0.6 \), distance \( d = 15 \, \text{pc} \).  
   - Extinction in the V band:  
     \[
     A_V = 3.1 \cdot E(B-V) = 3.1 \cdot 0.6 = 1.86
     \]  
   - The given apparent magnitude \( m = 15.5 \) is interpreted as the observed (corrected) magnitude, which already includes extinction.  
   - Apparent magnitude \( m = 15.5 \), which is within both ESPRESSO (\( \leq 17 \)) and HIRES (\( \leq 16 \)) limits.  
   - **Detectable by both instruments.**

4. **Star4**:  
   - Absolute V magnitude \( M = 15.5 \), \( E(B-V) = 0.4 \), distance \( d = 10 \, \text{pc} \).  
   - Apparent magnitude without extinction:  
     \[
     m = M + 5 \log_{10}(d/10) = 15.5 + 5 \log_{10}(10/10) = 15.5
     \]  
   - Extinction in the V band:  
     \[
     A_V = 3.1 \cdot E(B-V) = 3.1 \cdot 0.4 = 1.24
     \]  
   - Observed apparent magnitude:  
     \[
     m_{\text{observed}} = m + A_V = 15.5 + 1.24 = 16.74
     \]  
   - Apparent magnitude \( m_{\text{observed}} = 16.74 \), which exceeds HIRES's limit (\( \leq 16 \)) but is within ESPRESSO's limit (\( \leq 17 \)).  
   - **Detectable only by ESPRESSO.**

5. **Star5**:  
   - Absolute V magnitude \( M = 16.5 \), distance \( d = 5 \, \text{pc} \).  
   - Apparent magnitude:  
     \[
     m = M + 5 \log_{10}(d/10) = 16.5 + 5 \log_{10}(5/10) = 16.5 - 1.505 = 15.0
     \]  
   - Apparent magnitude \( m = 15.0 \), which is within both ESPRESSO (\( \leq 17 \)) and HIRES (\( \leq 16 \)) limits.  
   - **Detectable by both instruments.**

### Conclusion:
Stars detectable by both ESPRESSO and HIRES are **Star3** (\( m = 15.5 \)) and **Star5** (\( m = 15.0 \)). The correct option is:

**Answer: B**
