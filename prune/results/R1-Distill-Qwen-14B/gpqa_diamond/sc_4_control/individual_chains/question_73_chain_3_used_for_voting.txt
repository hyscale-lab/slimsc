Okay, so I have this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, let me think.

Alright, the problem says there are two astronauts. Their masses are 2m and 3m. They're moving in the positive x-direction at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively. Wait, c is the speed of light, right?

First, the question is asking for two things: the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. The options are A, B, C, D. Let's tackle each part.

Starting with the relative speed. I remember that when dealing with velocities in relativity, you can't just subtract them like in classical mechanics. Oh right, Einstein's velocity addition formula comes into play here. The formula is:

v_rel = (u - v) / (1 - (u*v)/(c²))

Wait, but u and v have to be the velocities of the two objects as observed from the same frame. In this case, both astronauts are moving in the same direction. Let me make sure I get the directions right.

Astronaut 1 has mass 2m and speed 0.6c. Astronaut 2 has mass 3m and speed 0.5c, both in the positive x-direction. So from the frame of reference of, say, a stationary observer, both are moving in the same direction. But the question is about their relative speed. So which is which?

Wait, no, the question is asking for the relative speed of one astronaut with respect to the other. So I think I should calculate how fast one is moving relative to the other. Let's say, what's the speed of astronaut 2 as seen from astronaut 1's frame, or vice versa.

Hmm, which one is the correct approach? Let me clarify. Let's pick astronaut 1's frame as the moving frame and see what astronaut 2's speed is in that frame.

Wait, astronaut 1 is moving at 0.6c relative to the lab frame. So the lab frame is where the observer sees both of them. If I want the speed of astronaut 2 from astronaut 1's perspective, I need to apply the velocity addition formula.

Wait, no. The velocity addition formula is when you have two frames moving relative to each other, and you want to find the velocity of an object in one frame based on its velocity in another. So, astronaut 1 is moving at 0.6c in the lab frame. Astronaut 2 is moving at 0.5c in the lab frame. So from astronaut 1's frame, how fast is astronaut 2 moving?

Wait, that's correct. So the relative velocity would be (0.5c - 0.6c) divided by (1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/(c²)).

Wait, wait, no. Let me write the formula correctly. The formula is (u' - v) / (1 - (u' v)/(c²)), where u' is the velocity of the object in the lab frame, and v is the velocity of the moving frame (the astronaut 1's frame) relative to the lab.

Wait no, more accurately, the formula is:

u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' v)/c² )

But wait, that's when u' is the velocity of the object in the lab frame, and v is the velocity of the moving frame (like a spaceship) relative to the lab. So if the moving frame is astronaut 1's frame, which is moving at v = 0.6c relative to the lab, then the object is astronaut 2, whose velocity in the lab is u' = 0.5c.

So wait, no. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

The velocity addition formula is u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' v)/c² ), where u is the velocity of the object in the moving frame S', and u' is the velocity in the lab frame (S). If the moving frame (S') is moving at speed v relative to S.

Wait, no. Let me get this right. Let me denote:

- S is the lab frame.

- S' is the frame of astronaut 1, which is moving at speed v = 0.6c in the positive x-direction relative to S.

In S, astronaut 2's velocity is u = 0.5c in the positive x-direction.

We want to find u', the velocity of astronaut 2 as seen from S' (astronaut 1's perspective).

So using the velocity addition formula:

u' = (u - v) / (1 - (u v)/(c²))

Plugging in u = 0.5c, v = 0.6c:

u' = (0.5c - 0.6c) / [1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/(c²) ]

Simplify numerator: 0.5 - 0.6 = -0.1, so -0.1c.

Denominator: 1 - (0.3 c²)/(c²) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7

So u' = (-0.1c) / 0.7 = approximately -0.142857c.

Wait, so the relative speed is about -0.1428c, which is about 0.143c, but negative. The negative sign indicates that astronaut 2 is moving in the opposite direction relative to astronaut 1. But when we talk about speed, the magnitude is 0.1428c, approximately 0.14c. So the relative speed is about 0.14c.

Alternatively, if we calculate the speed of astronaut 1 as seen from astronaut 2's frame, perhaps the same magnitude would apply, but positive. Wait, no, depending on which frame you're considering.

Wait, because in this case, astronaut 2 is moving slower than astronaut 1. So from astronaut 1's frame, astronaut 2 is moving backward at 0.14c. So the relative speed is 0.14c.

Wait, but in relativity, the relative speed between two objects is not necessarily symmetric, right? Because the calculation depends on the observer's frame.

But in any case, the problem is asking for the relative speed. So the calculation gives approximately 0.14c, which matches one of the options.

Looking at the options, let's see. Option C says v_rel=0.14c, option D also v_rel=0.14c. So the relative speed is 0.14c.

Wait, but wait, the problem is asking for the relative speed between the two astronauts. So I should consider that the relative speed is the magnitude of the difference in their velocities in the same frame. Alternatively, perhaps we should consider the proper way to compute the relative velocity between the two.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to think about the relative velocity between the two astronauts. So in the lab frame, astronaut 1 is at 0.6c, astronaut 2 at 0.5c. So in the lab frame, astronaut 2 is behind astronaut 1, moving slower. So the relative speed of astronaut 2 with respect to astronaut 1 is (0.5c - 0.6c) = -0.1c in the lab frame. But relativity says that you can't just add velocities like that; you need to use the velocity addition formula.

Wait, but in the lab frame, the relative speed isn't the same as from either astronaut's perspective. Wait, no. The relative speed in the lab frame is just 0.1c, but that's not the correct approach because from the lab frame, the relative speed is indeed 0.1c, but in reality, when you're moving relative to each other, the relative speed as each observes the other is different.

Wait no, no, in the lab frame, the speed of astronaut 2 relative to astronaut 1 is indeed (0.6c - 0.5c) = 0.1c, but that's in the lab frame. But that's not what the problem is asking. The problem is asking for the relative speed between the two astronauts, which would be their speed as observed from each other's frame.

Wait, I think I got confused earlier. Let me clarify: The question is asking for the relative speed between the two astronauts. So that would be the speed of one as seen from the frame of the other.

So if astronaut 1 is moving at 0.6c, and astronaut 2 at 0.5c, both in the same direction, the relative speed is (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c*0.5c)/(c²)) )= (0.1c)/(1 - 0.3c²/c²) = 0.1c / 0.7 ≈ 0.1428c, about 0.143c.

Wait, wait a minute. No, wait, that's the other way around. Let me re-derive it properly.

The velocity of astronaut 2 as seen from astronaut 1's frame is u' = (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/c²), where u is the velocity of astronaut 2 in the lab frame (0.5c), and v is the velocity of astronaut 1 in the lab frame (0.6c). So:

u' = (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/(c²)) ) = (-0.1c) / (1 - 0.3) = (-0.1c)/0.7 ≈ -0.1428c.

The magnitude is 0.1428c, so about 0.14c.

So the relative speed is 0.14c. That matches with options C and D.

Now, moving to the second part: the total energy of the system.

The system consists of two astronauts, each moving at their respective speeds.

But wait, in relativity, the total energy isn't just the sum of their rest mass energies. Each has kinetic energy plus rest energy.

Wait, the total energy E is the sum of the energies of each astronaut. Each astronaut's energy is gamma multiplied by their rest mass energy (mc²), where gamma is the Lorentz factor.

Wait, but wait, each astronaut's mass is 2m and 3m. So for astronaut 1, mass m1=2m, moving at 0.6c. So gamma1 = 1/sqrt(1 - (v1^2/c^2)).

Same for astronaut 2: m2 =3m, moving at v2=0.5c.

Let me compute each gamma.

For astronaut 1:

v1 = 0.6c.

gamma1 = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.

So astronaut 1's energy is gamma1 * m1 c² = 1.25 * 2m * c² = 2.5 m c².

Wait, wait, no. Wait, the rest energy is m c². So for astronaut 1, the rest mass is 2m, so rest energy is 2m c². So E1 = gamma1 * (2m c²) = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

Similarly for astronaut 2, v2=0.5c.

gamma2 = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547.

So E2 = gamma2 * m2 c² = 1.1547 *3m c² ≈ 3.464 m c².

Wait, let me compute more precisely. sqrt(0.75) is sqrt(3/4) = (sqrt(3))/2 ≈ 0.8660. So 1/sqrt(0.75) is 1/0.8660 ≈ 1.1547.

So E2 = 1.1547 *3m c² = 3.4641 m c².

So the total energy E_total = E1 + E2 = 2.5 m c² + 3.4641 m c² = 5.9641 m c².

Looking at the options:

Option B: E=4.96 mc^2. Option C: E=5.96 mc^2. Option D: E=5 mc².

So 5.96 is close to option C, which says E=5.96 mc².

So the total energy is approximately 5.96 mc², and the relative speed is 0.14c. Looking at the options, option C has both.

Wait, but let me double-check the energy calculations.

E1: 2.5 mc². E2: 3.464 mc².

Sum is 5.964 mc², which is approximately 5.96. So option C is correct.

But wait, another thought: Are we considering the system's total energy, or the energy in a particular frame?

In the lab frame, the total energy is the sum of each astronaut's energy. So that's correct.

So the options with v_rel=0.14c and E≈5.96 mc² is option C.

Looking back at the options:

Option C: v_rel=0.14c, E=5.96 mc².

Option D: v_rel=0.14c, E=5 mc².

So option C is looking correct.

So the correct answer should be option C.

To solve the problem, we calculate the relative speed between the two astronauts using Einstein's velocity addition formula and determine the total energy of the system by summing the relativistic energies of both astronauts.

### Relative Speed Calculation
The relative speed of astronaut 2 (moving at \( 0.5c \)) as seen from astronaut 1's frame (moving at \( 0.6c \)) is given by:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{u - v}{1 - \frac{uv}{c^2}}
\]

Substituting \( u = 0.5c \) and \( v = 0.6c \):

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.5c - 0.6c}{1 - \frac{(0.5c)(0.6c)}{c^2}} = \frac{-0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{-0.1c}{0.7} \approx -0.1428c
\]

The negative sign indicates that astronaut 2 is moving backward relative to astronaut 1. The magnitude of the relative speed is approximately \( 0.14c \).

### Total Energy Calculation
The total energy of the system is the sum of the relativistic energies of both astronauts. The relativistic energy of an object is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2
\]

where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}} \).

#### For astronaut 1:
- Mass \( m_1 = 2m \), velocity \( v_1 = 0.6c \).
- \( \gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25 \).
- Energy \( E_1 = \gamma_1 m_1 c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2 \).

#### For astronaut 2:
- Mass \( m_2 = 3m \), velocity \( v_2 = 0.5c \).
- \( \gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547 \).
- Energy \( E_2 = \gamma_2 m_2 c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464m c^2 \).

#### Total Energy:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5m c^2 + 3.464m c^2 \approx 5.964m c^2
\]

### Final Answer
The relative speed is approximately \( 0.14c \), and the total energy of the system is approximately \( 5.96m c^2 \). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:
