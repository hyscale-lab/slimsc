Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here. Let me try to understand what's going on. The question is about a star with some spots and how that affects the observed brightness changes. Then, it's comparing that to the effect a planet would have. I need to find the radius of a hypothetical planet relative to the star that would produce the same brightness variation.

Alright, let's break it down. The star has a radius equal to the Sun, so Rstar is 1 R_sun. The effective temperature is 6000 K, same as the Sun. One hemisphere has dark spots covering 20% of that hemisphere. The spots are cooler, with a temperature difference of 1000 K. So the spots are at 5000 K?

The problem says that when the star rotates, the spots come into view, causing brightness variations. But if the star weren't spotted, what planet radius would cause the same change in light curve amplitude.

Wait, so the brightness variation caused by the spots should be the same as that caused by a planet blocking the star's light. So the question is about the relative radius.

I remember that the change in brightness (the dip) when a planet transits a star is given by the formula (Rp / Rstar)^2, where Rp is the planet radius and Rstar is the star's radius. Because the area blocked is proportional to the square of the radius ratio.

But wait, the spots are not causing a simple transit. They are dark regions on the star, so when they rotate into view, they make the star appear dimmer. The difference in brightness is due to the difference in temperature between the spots and the rest of the star.

So the total brightness without spots is uniform, but the spots make part of the star's surface emit less light. Let me think about the flux from the spots vs the rest.

The flux from a star is proportional to T^4 times the area. Since the star is a sphere, the surface area per unit area is the same, so each spot contributes less flux.

The filling factor is 20%, which means that 20% of the hemisphere is covered by spots. Wait, the problem says, "one hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%." So the filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere that's spotted. So 20% of the hemisphere's area is covered by spots.

Let me calculate the total flux from the star when the spots are visible. Normally, the star's total flux is sigma * Teff^4 * 4 pi Rstar^2. But with spots, part of the surface emits less.

The hemisphere has area 2 pi Rstar^2. The spots cover 0.2 * 2 pi Rstar^2. So the area of spots is 0.2 * 2 pi Rstar^2 = 0.4 pi Rstar^2.

Each spot has a temperature of 5000 K. The flux per unit area from the spots is sigma * (5000)^4, and from the rest of the hemisphere, it's sigma * (6000)^4.

So the total flux when the spots are visible is:

Flux_total = (Area_unspotted * T_unspotted^4) + (Area_spotted * T_spotted^4)
= [ (2 pi R^2) * (1 - 0.2) ) * (6000^4) ] + [ (2 pi R^2 * 0.2) ) * (5000^4) ]

Wait, wait, actually, the entire star's flux is (4 pi R^2 * sigma Teff^4). But when looking at a hemisphere, we see half the star. When spots are in that hemisphere, they replace (cover) a part of it.

Wait, no. The star is a sphere, but when we observe it, we see only one hemisphere at a time. When the spots are on the visible hemisphere, they contribute less flux. The other hemisphere is the same as the star's average.

But perhaps a better approach is to model the star as a two-component system: the spotted area and the unspotted area within the hemisphere.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the flux change when spots rotate into view. The star is symmetric, but as it rotates, the spots come into the observed hemisphere, causing a dip in brightness.

Wait, no, the spots are on one hemisphere, so when the star rotates, that hemisphere comes into view, and the spots are visible. So the change in brightness isn't just from the spots appearing and disappearing, but the fact that the brightness is modulated as the spotted hemisphere comes into view and then goes away.

Wait, but the problem states that the situation can closely resemble the presence of an exoplanet. So the variation caused by the spots must look similar to that of a planet transiting.

But I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think step by step.

The star's brightness variation when the spots are rotating into view is due to the spots being cooler. So the dip in brightness is not as deep as a planet would cause because the spots don't completely block the light but just make part of it dimmer.

Wait, no. When a planet transits, it blocks a part of the star's light, causing a dip proportional to (Rp/Rstar)^2. The spots, on the other hand, make the star appear dimmer because the spots are cooler. So the change in brightness would be like:

Flux when spots are visible: F = F_total - Delta_F, where Delta_F is the difference between the unspotted and spotted flux.

Wait, perhaps I should model the change in flux when the spots rotate to face us.

The star's total flux without any spots is F0 = 4 pi Rstar^2 * sigma * Teff^4.

When a hemisphere is spotted, but only part of it, the observed flux will change as the star rotates. The maximum and minimum flux can be calculated, and the amplitude is the difference between max and min.

Wait, but in this problem, the star is currently being observed and is showing a variation in brightness due to spots on one hemisphere. The question is, what planet radius would produce the same amplitude in the light curve, assuming the star wasn't spotted.

So we need to compute the amplitude of the brightness variation caused by the spots and set that equal to the amplitude caused by a planet. Then, solve for Rp.

So, let's compute the amplitude of the brightness variation due to the spots.

When the spotted hemisphere is viewed edge-on (i.e., when the spots are fully visible), the star's flux is F_spots_visible.

When the other hemisphere (unspotted) is viewed, the flux is F_unspotted.

Wait, but if the star is a sphere, the other hemisphere isn't completely unspotted; the question says that one hemisphere is covered in spots, so the other hemisphere is unspotted.

So when the star is in a position where the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the flux is F_spotted. When it's the other hemisphere, the flux is F_unspotted.

The amplitude of the variation (the peak-to-peak change) is F_unspotted - F_spotted.

But let me calculate it.

First, the total flux without any spots (F0) is:

F0 = 4 pi Rstar^2 * sigma * Teff^4.

But when the star has spots on one hemisphere, the flux when the spotted hemisphere is visible is F_spotted, and when the unspotted hemisphere is visible, it's F_unspotted.

Wait, no. When the star is viewed from Earth, we only see one hemisphere at a time. So when the star is in a position where the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the flux is F_spotted. When it's the other way (unspotted hemisphere), it's F_unspotted.

So the amplitude of the brightness variation is F_unspotted - F_spotted.

Let me compute F_spotted and F_unspotted.

The spotted hemisphere has a filling factor of 20% (0.2) with spots at 5000 K.

So the flux from the spotted hemisphere is:

F_spotted_hemisphere = (Area_unspotted * sigma * T_unspotted^4) + (Area_spotted * sigma * T_spotted^4)

The area of a hemisphere is 2 pi R^2.

So, Area_unspotted = 0.8 * 2 pi R^2 = 1.6 pi R^2.

Area_spotted = 0.2 * 2 pi R^2 = 0.4 pi R^2.

So F_spotted_hemisphere = (1.6 pi R^2)(sigma (6000)^4) + (0.4 pi R^2)(sigma (5000)^4).

Similarly, the unspotted hemisphere is all at 6000 K. So F_unspotted_hemisphere = 2 pi R^2 * sigma (6000)^4.

Wait, wait. No, because when the other hemisphere is visible, it's entirely unspotted. So the flux is from that hemisphere, which is 6000 K everywhere.

So F_unspotted_hemisphere = 2 pi R^2 * sigma (6000)^4.

Similarly, F_spotted_hemisphere is a mix of 6000 K and 5000 K.

So the flux when the spotted hemisphere is facing us is F_spotted = F_spotted_hemisphere.

The flux when the unspotted hemisphere is facing us is F_unspotted = F_unspotted_hemisphere.

So the variation amplitude (delta F) is F_unspotted - F_spotted.

Wait, but the star's total flux alternates between these two, so the change in brightness is the difference between the two.

But wait, the star's total flux is from only one hemisphere when viewed from Earth (assuming edge-on viewing, which is when transits occur). So when the spotted hemisphere is visible, the flux is F_spotted_hemisphere, and when the unspotted is visible, it's F_unspotted_hemisphere.

So the amplitude is |F_unspotted_hemisphere - F_spotted_hemisphere|.

Let me compute this.

Compute F_unspotted_hemisphere:

F_unspotted = 2 pi R^2 * sigma (6000)^4.

Compute F_spotted_hemisphere:

F_spotted = (1.6 pi R^2) * sigma (6000)^4 + (0.4 pi R^2) * sigma (5000)^4.

Factor out pi R^2 sigma:

F_spotted = pi R^2 sigma [1.6*(6000^4) + 0.4*(5000^4)].

Similarly, F_unspotted = 2 pi R^2 sigma (6000^4).

So the difference, delta F = F_unspotted - F_spotted.

= 2 pi R^2 sigma (6000^4) - [1.6 pi R^2 sigma (6000^4) + 0.4 pi R^2 sigma (5000^4)].

= pi R^2 sigma [ (2 *6^4) - (1.6 *6^4 + 0.4 *5^4) ) ]

Let me compute the terms inside:

2 *6^4 = 2 * 1296 = 2592.

1.6 *6^4 = 1.6 *1296 = 2073.6.

0.4 *5^4 = 0.4 *625 = 250.

So inside the brackets: 2592 - (2073.6 +250) = 2592 -2323.6 = 268.4.

So delta F = pi R^2 sigma * 268.4.

Now, the amplitude of the brightness variation is delta F.

But wait, when the planet transits, it blocks a part of the star's light. The amplitude dip is (Rp/Rstar)^2 times the star's flux.

Wait, no. The dip in flux is (Rp^2 / Rstar^2) of the star's flux. Because the area blocked is pi Rp^2, and the star's area is pi Rstar^2. So the dip is (Rp^2)/(Rstar^2) times the total flux.

Wait, more accurately, when a planet transits, it blocks a fraction (Rp / Rstar)^2 of the star's light. So the dip in flux is F0 * (Rp^2 / Rstar^2), where F0 is the total flux of the star.

In the case of the spots, the dip in flux is delta F = F_unspotted - F_spotted.

But wait, actually, when the spots are visible, the flux is lower than when the unspotted hemisphere is visible. So the maximum flux is F_unspotted, and the minimum is F_spotted. The amplitude is F_unspotted - F_spotted.

We need to set this equal to the dip caused by the planet, which is (Rp^2 / Rstar^2) * F0.

Wait, no. The planet causes a dip of (Rp/Rstar)^2 * F0.

So, delta F (from spots) = (Rp/Rstar)^2 * F0.

Wait, let me think:

The planet blocks a part of the star's light, causing a dip of F_planet_dip = (Rp^2 / Rstar^2) * F0.

Similarly, the star's brightness when the spots are visible is F_spotted, and when unspotted, F_unspotted. So amplitude is F_unspotted - F_spotted.

But wait, when the star is unspotted, the flux is F_unspotted = 2 pi R^2 sigma (6000)^4.

When there's no spot, the star's flux is F0 = 4 pi R^2 sigma (6000)^4. Because without any spots, the entire surface is at 6000 K.

But when only a hemisphere is observed (due to rotation), the flux is half of F0, because F0 is for the entire star. Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, no. The entire star emits 4 pi R^2 sigma Teff^4. So when we observe it, we see half the star (the hemisphere), so the flux we receive is (2 pi R^2 sigma Teff^4).

Ah, wait, that makes sense. So F0_observed = 2 pi R^2 sigma T^4.

Because the star emits 4 pi R^2 sigma T^4 total, but we see only half of it when looking at a single hemisphere.

So without any spots, the observed flux F0_observed is 2 pi R^2 sigma (6000)^4.

In the case of the spotted star, when the spotted hemisphere is visible, the observed flux is F_spotted_hemisphere.

So the dip in flux is F0_observed - F_spotted_hemisphere.

Wait, but previously I computed F_unspotted_hemisphere, but that's when the unspotted hemisphere is visible. So the maximum flux is F_unspotted_hemisphere = 2 pi R^2 sigma (6000)^4, same as F0_observed.

Wait, when the star is unspotted, F0_observed is 2 pi R^2 sigma (6000)^4.

But when the star is spotted, when the unspotted hemisphere is visible, F is same as F0_observed. When the spotted hemisphere is visible, the flux is F_spotted_hemisphere.

So the variation in brightness is F0_observed - F_spotted_hemisphere. Which is the dip when the spots are visible.

Wait, no. When the unspotted hemisphere is visible, F is F0_observed. When the spotted hemisphere is visible, F is F_spotted_hemisphere. So the maximum flux is F0_observed, and the minimum is F_spotted_hemisphere. So the amplitude is F0_observed - F_spotted_hemisphere.

Earlier, I computed delta F as F_unspotted_hemisphere - F_spotted_hemisphere, but F_unspotted_hemisphere is same as F0_observed.

So the dip in brightness is (F0_observed - F_spotted_hemisphere).

Which is the same as the dip caused by a planet: dip_planet = (Rp^2 / Rstar^2) * F0_observed.

So, dip_spots = (F0_observed - F_spotted_hemisphere) = dip_planet = (Rp^2 / Rstar^2) F0_observed.

So, we can set:

(F0_observed - F_spotted_hemisphere) = (Rp^2 / Rstar^2) F0_observed.

We can solve for Rp / Rstar.

Let me compute the left side: (F0_observed - F_spotted_hemisphere) / F0_observed.

Let me compute (F0_observed - F_spotted_hemisphere) / F0_observed.

F0_observed = 2 pi R^2 sigma (6000)^4.

F_spotted_hemisphere = pi R^2 sigma [1.6 * (6000)^4 + 0.4 * (5000)^4 ].

So,

(F0_observed - F_spotted) / F0_observed = [2 pi R^2 sigma (6000^4) - pi R^2 sigma (1.6*6000^4 + 0.4*5000^4) ] / [2 pi R^2 sigma 6000^4 ]

Factor out pi R^2 sigma from numerator and denominator:

= [ 2 (6000^4) - (1.6 *6000^4 + 0.4 *5000^4) ] / [ 2 *6000^4 ]

Let me compute numerator:

= (2 * 1296e8) - [1.6 * 1296e8 + 0.4 * 625e8 ]

Wait, 6000^4 is (6e3)^4 = 1.296e16, but perhaps I'll compute the numerical factors first.

Compute 2*6^4 = 2*1296 = 2592.

1.6*6^4 = 1.6*1296 = 2073.6.

0.4*5^4 = 0.4*625 = 250.

So numerator becomes: 2592 - (2073.6 + 250) = 2592 - 2323.6 = 268.4.

Denominator: 2 * 1296 = 2592.

So (268.4) / (2592) ≈ 0.1035.

So, (F0 - F_spotted)/F0 = 0.1035.

Which is approximately 10.35% of F0.

So dip_spots = 0.1035 F0.

Which is equal to dip_planet = (Rp/Rstar)^2 F0.

So,

0.1035 F0 = (Rp/Rstar)^2 F0.

Divide both sides by F0:

0.1035 = (Rp/Rstar)^2.

Take square root:

Rp/Rstar = sqrt(0.1035) ≈ 0.3217.

Hmm. Wait, but the options are:

A) ~0.39

B) ~0.07

C) ~0.11

D) ~0.32

So approximately 0.32, which is option D.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations.

Wait, I think I made a mistake in the calculation of (F0_observed - F_spotted_hemisphere) / F0_observed.

Wait, F0_observed is 2 pi R^2 sigma (6000^4).

F_spotted_hemisphere is pi R^2 sigma [1.6*(6000^4) + 0.4*(5000^4)].

So the difference is:

F0_observed - F_spotted_hemisphere = 2 pi R^2 sigma (6000^4) - pi R^2 sigma [1.6*(6000^4) + 0.4*(5000^4)]

= pi R^2 sigma [ 2*(6^4) - (1.6*(6^4) + 0.4*(5^4)) ]

= pi R^2 sigma [ (2*1296 - 2073.6 - 250) ]

Wait, 2*1296 is 2592.

2592 - 2073.6 is 518.4.

518.4 -250 = 268.4.

So yes, 268.4, as before.

Then, (268.4) / (2592) = 0.1035.

So the dip caused by the spots is about 10.35% of F0.

Which would be the same as a planet causing a dip of 10.35%.

So the planet's dip is (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.1035.

So Rp/Rstar = sqrt(0.1035) ≈ 0.3217, about 0.32.

Looking at the options, option D is ~0.32.

So the answer should be D.

To determine the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation as the star with spotted regions, we analyze the brightness changes caused by the spots and compare them to those caused by a transiting planet.

### Key Information:
1. **Star Properties**:
   - Radius: \( R_{\text{star}} = R_{\odot} \)
   - Effective temperature: \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \)
   - One hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%.
   - Spots are cooler, with \( T_{\text{spots}} = 5000 \, \text{K} \).

2. **Brightness Variation**:
   - The star's total flux without spots is \( F_0 = 4 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \sigma T_{\text{eff}}^4 \).
   - When observed, only one hemisphere is visible, so the observed flux is \( F_{\text{observed}} = 2 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \sigma T_{\text{eff}}^4 \).
   - When the spotted hemisphere is visible, the flux is reduced due to the cooler spots. The flux from the spotted hemisphere is:
     \[
     F_{\text{spotted}} = \left( 0.8 \cdot 2 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \cdot \sigma \cdot 6000^4 \right) + \left( 0.2 \cdot 2 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \cdot \sigma \cdot 5000^4 \right)
     \]
   - The brightness variation amplitude is the difference between the flux when the unspotted hemisphere is visible (\( F_{\text{unspotted}} = 2 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \sigma 6000^4 \)) and the flux when the spotted hemisphere is visible (\( F_{\text{spotted}} \)):
     \[
     \Delta F = F_{\text{unspotted}} - F_{\text{spotted}}
     \]

3. **Planet Transit Brightness Variation**:
   - A planet transiting the star blocks a fraction of the star's light proportional to \( \left( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2 \). The dip in flux is:
     \[
     \Delta F_{\text{planet}} = \left( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2 \cdot F_{\text{observed}}
     \]

4. **Equating the Amplitudes**:
   - The brightness variation caused by the spots (\( \Delta F \)) must equal the brightness variation caused by the planet (\( \Delta F_{\text{planet}} \)):
     \[
     \Delta F = \Delta F_{\text{planet}}
     \]
   - Substituting the expressions for \( \Delta F \) and \( \Delta F_{\text{planet}} \), we solve for \( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \).

### Calculations:
1. Compute \( \Delta F \):
   - \( F_{\text{unspotted}} = 2 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \sigma 6000^4 \)
   - \( F_{\text{spotted}} = \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \sigma \left( 1.6 \cdot 6000^4 + 0.4 \cdot 5000^4 \right) \)
   - \( \Delta F = F_{\text{unspotted}} - F_{\text{spotted}} \)
   - Simplify:
     \[
     \Delta F = \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \sigma \left( 2 \cdot 6000^4 - \left( 1.6 \cdot 6000^4 + 0.4 \cdot 5000^4 \right) \right)
     \]
     \[
     \Delta F = \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \sigma \left( 2592 - 2323.6 \right) = \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \sigma \cdot 268.4
     \]

2. Compute the fraction of \( F_{\text{observed}} \) that \( \Delta F \) represents:
   - \( F_{\text{observed}} = 2 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \sigma 6000^4 \)
   - \( \frac{\Delta F}{F_{\text{observed}}} = \frac{268.4}{2592} \approx 0.1035 \)

3. Set \( \Delta F = \Delta F_{\text{planet}} \):
   - \( 0.1035 \cdot F_{\text{observed}} = \left( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2 \cdot F_{\text{observed}} \)
   - Solve for \( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \):
     \[
     \left( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2 = 0.1035
     \]
     \[
     \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} = \sqrt{0.1035} \approx 0.3217
     \]

### Final Answer:
The radius of the hypothetical exoplanet relative to the host star is approximately **0.32**, corresponding to **Option D**.

Answer: D
