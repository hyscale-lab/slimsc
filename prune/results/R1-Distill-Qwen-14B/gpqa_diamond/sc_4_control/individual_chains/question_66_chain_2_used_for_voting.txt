Okay, so I have this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Hmm, I need to figure out which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. Let me think about what I know.

First, SMEFT is an effective theory that extends the Standard Model by including higher-dimensional operators. These operators are added to the SM Lagrangian, but they must respect certain symmetries, right?

The question lists four options: Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincaré symmetry (2), CP symmetry (3), and CPT symmetry (4). I need to determine which of these must be respected by all operators in SMEFT.

Wait, I remember that effective theories usually maintain the same symmetries as the underlying theory, which in this case is the Standard Model. The Standard Model respects certain symmetries, so SMEFT should too.

Let me recall each symmetry:

1. Lorentz Symmetry: This is the symmetry of special relativity. All terms in the Lagrangian must be Lorentz invariant. So SMEFT operators must respect this. Otherwise, they would introduce terms that aren't compatible with relativity.

2. Poincaré Symmetry: This includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations (like momentum conservation). If the theory has a Poincaré symmetry, it also has a notion of energy and momentum. I think the SMEFT respects Poincaré symmetry because the SM does. So both 1 and 2 are correct.

Wait, but wait. Lorentz symmetry is a part of Poincaré symmetry. So if a theory respects Poincaré, it automatically respects Lorentz. But the question is about which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So do the operators need to respect both, or just the larger symmetry?

But the options are given as separate choices. So SMEFT operators must respect both Lorentz and Poincaré? Or does Poincaré imply Lorentz? Because Poincaré includes Lorentz, but the SMEFT terms are required to be Poincaré invariant. So maybe both 1 and 2 are correct. But wait, I'm a bit confused.

Wait, no. The SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory, so all operators must be Lorentz scalars. Poincaré includes Lorentz transformations and spacetime translations. But when you add operators to the SMEFT Lagrangian, each operator is a Lorentz scalar and a Poincaré scalar. So operators must respect both. So both 1 and 2 are correct.

But wait, I'm not entirely sure. I might be mixing things up. Let me think: The Standard Model has Poincaré symmetry. SMEFT is an effective theory that includes the SM, so it must respect the same symmetries. So all operators in SMEFT must respect Poincaré symmetry. Therefore, both 1 and 2 are correct.

But wait, another angle: when you construct SMEFT operators, you have to ensure that they're part of a renormalizable theory? No, SMEFT is non-renormalizable. But that's not directly related to the symmetries.

So moving on, 3. CP symmetry: The Standard Model isn't CP symmetric. For example, the CKM matrix has CP violation. So the SM doesn't have CP symmetry. Therefore, SMEFT doesn't need to respect CP symmetry. So operators in SMEFT don't have to preserve CP. So option 3 is incorrect.

4. CPT symmetry: The Standard Model has CPT symmetry. C is charge conjugation, P is parity, T is time reversal. CPT is a symmetry in quantum field theories. So SMEFT, being an effective theory of the SM, must respect CPT symmetry. So any operator added must respect CPT.

Wait, but wait. Do all operators have to have even CPT properties? Or can they violate it? I think that in the SMEFT, operators must transform correctly under the symmetries of the SM. Since the SM has CPT symmetry, SMEFT operators must too. So 4 is correct.

So putting it all together. Symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are Lorentz (1), Poincaré (2), and CPT (4). Wait, but wait. I thought Poincaré symmetry includes Lorentz. So the operators must respect both? Or just Poincaré?

Wait, no, the Poincaré group is the combination of Lorentz and translations. But when you say an operator respects Poincaré, it implies it's invariant under both. So SMEFT operators must respect Poincaré. So when the question asks which must be respected, if the operators are Poincaré invariant, then they are automatically Lorentz invariant. So maybe the operators must respect Poincaré (2), which would include Lorentz (1). But the question is which of the four must be respected by all operators. The options are given as four separate points.

So if option 2 (Poincaré) is correct, then option 1 (Lorentz) is automatically correct because Poincaré includes Lorentz. But the question gives options where 1 is separate. So the question is, do the operators in SMEFT have to respect both Lorentz and Poincaré, or just Poincaré? Because if Poincaré is already a larger symmetry, then it's redundant to check Lorentz.

Wait, but the SMEFT is constructed in such a way that all terms are Poincaré invariant. So all operators must respect Poincaré symmetry, which includes Lorentz. So in that case, both 1 and 2 are correct. So the correct symmetries are 1,2,4.

Wait, but I'm not too sure. Let me think again. The Poincaré group includes translations and Lorentz transformations. So if an operator is Poincaré-invariant, it automatically respects Lorentz symmetry. So if the operator respects Poincaré, then 1 is automatically respected. So if the question is which symmetries must be respected, 2 implies 1.

But the question is worded as which must be respected. So if the operators are required to be Poincaré invariant, then 2 is correct. So in the answer, 1 and 2 would both be correct. But I'm not 100% confident.

Wait, another angle. The SM's Lagrangian is Poincaré invariant. SMEFT is a generalization, so all operators added must preserve this symmetry. So yes, all operators must respect Poincaré symmetry, which includes Lorentz. So both 1 and 2 are correct. But the options don't have 1,2 and 4 as an option. Wait, looking at the options:

Options:

A) 1,2

B) 3,4

C)1,2,4

D)1,3,4

Wait, option C is 1,2,4. So if I think that 2 is correct, including 1, but also 4, then the correct answer would be C.

But wait, earlier I thought that 3 is incorrect (CP symmetry not needed) and 4 is correct (CPT is needed). So if 1,2,4 are correct, then answer is C.

But wait, another thought: does SMEFT respect Poincaré symmetry? Or does it just respect Lorentz symmetry?

Wait, the SM is Poincaré invariant. SMEFT is built by adding higher-dimensional terms, but they must preserve the same symmetries as the SM. Therefore, SMEFT operators must respect Poincaré symmetry. So 2 is correct.

But sometimes, when you add higher-dimension operators, you have to make sure they are Poincaré invariant. So the operators must be Poincaré scalars. So they are automatically Lorentz scalars, but the main point is Poincaré.

So why is Lorentz (1) an option then? Because in the SMEFT, the operators have to be Lorentz scalars. So 1 and 2 are both correct.

Wait, perhaps both 1 and 2 are correct. So the correct options would be 1,2,4.

So looking back at the options, option C is 1,2,4.

But wait, another point: Poincaré symmetry includes both Lorentz and translations. So if the operator is translation invariant, it must have a definite momentum. But in the SMEFT, when you write operators, they can have higher derivatives, but each term must have the same Lorentz and Poincaré structure as the SM. So the operators are constructed as local operators, hence respecting both Lorentz and translations.

So yes, both 1 and 2 are correct. So the correct answer should include 1,2, and 4.

So the options are option C (1,2,4) and option A (1,2). So which is correct?

Wait, perhaps Poincaré symmetry is automatically included if Lorentz and translation symmetry are. But the key is that SMEFT must respect all the symmetries of the SM. The SM has Poincaré symmetry. So all SMEFT operators must respect Poincaré symmetry.

So the answer includes both 1 and 2, plus 4. So option C.

But another point: the CPT symmetry is a bigger symmetry. The SM has CPT symmetry, so SMEFT must respect it. So 4 is correct.

So the correct options are 1,2,4. So option C.

The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is an extension of the Standard Model (SM) that includes higher-dimensional operators while respecting the same symmetries as the SM. To determine which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT, we analyze the four options provided:

1. **Lorentz Symmetry**: This symmetry is fundamental to special relativity and requires that all terms in the Lagrangian be Lorentz-invariant. Since SMEFT is built upon the SM, which respects Lorentz symmetry, all SMEFT operators must also respect this symmetry.

2. **Poincaré Symmetry**: This symmetry includes both Lorentz transformations and spacetime translations. The SM respects Poincaré symmetry, and SMEFT, as an effective theory, must preserve this symmetry as well. Therefore, all SMEFT operators must respect Poincaré symmetry. Since Poincaré symmetry encompasses Lorentz symmetry, the respect for Poincaré symmetry automatically ensures Lorentz symmetry.

3. **CP Symmetry**: The SM does not respect CP symmetry due to phenomena like CP violation in the CKM matrix. Consequently, SMEFT does not need to preserve CP symmetry, and operators in SMEFT are not required to respect this symmetry.

4. **CPT Symmetry**: The SM respects CPT symmetry, and SMEFT, as an effective theory, must preserve this symmetry as well. Therefore, all SMEFT operators must respect CPT symmetry.

Given this analysis, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are **Lorentz symmetry (1)**, **Poincaré symmetry (2)**, and **CPT symmetry (4)**. While Poincaré symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry, both are explicitly listed in the question, so both are included in the correct answer.

Thus, the correct answer is **C) 1,2,4**.
