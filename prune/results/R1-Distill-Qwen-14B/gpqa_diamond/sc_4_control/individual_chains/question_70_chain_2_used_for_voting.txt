Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question involves a series of reactions, and I need to determine the molecular symmetry group of product E. The options are A) C2, B) D4h, C) D∞h, D) C2v.

Alright, let's start by breaking down each reaction given.

First reaction: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. Hmm, 8 equivalents suggests that the stoichiometry is A + 8B → C. What compounds react in such a way? Maybe metal sulfides reacting with something. Wait, but more likely, perhaps a metal reacting with a diatomic gas. Like, for example, sulfur trioxide or something else. Or maybe, considering the 8 moles of B, it's something like O2? Wait, 8 B per A. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: if B is a diatomic gas, like O2, and the reaction produces something like an oxide. Suppose A is a metal, like sodium. Sodium reacts with O2 to form Na2O2? Wait, but sodium would react with O2 in a 2:1 ratio. Hmm, not matching 8.

Wait, maybe B is Cl2. Because sometimes metals react with Cl2 in certain ratios. For example, aluminum reacts with Cl2 in a 2:3 ratio, but that's in a different context, like burning.

Wait, another angle. The product C is bright red. That makes me think of something like iron(III) oxide, but that's not red. Wait, iron(III) oxide is reddish, but maybe not bright red. Alternatively, maybe it's something like mercury(II) oxide, which is red. Or maybe it's a sulfide. Wait, another thought: maybe C is SO3? No, that's a gas. Wait, perhaps it's a nitride? Not sure.

Wait, maybe I should think about the second reaction. C reacts with 2 equivalents of D to form E, which is extremely hazardous. Then, C reacts with water to give A, F, and G, where F is a strong acid and G is a weak acid.

So when C reacts with water, it produces A, F, and G. Let's think about possible C that when hydrolyzed gives a strong acid and a weak acid.

Wait, maybe C is a sulfite? No, not sure. Or maybe C is a nitride, but that's probably not. Alternatively, maybe C is a sulfate? Wait, suppose A is sodium (Na), B is oxygen (O2), but the ratio doesn't fit.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about the products when C reacts with water. The products are A, F, and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid.

So when C reacts with water, it produces a metal (A), and two acids F and G. So perhaps C is a sulfide, like FeS, but that when reacted with water, perhaps under acidic or basic conditions?

Wait, let's think of something else. Suppose C is a sulfide, like CuS, but when it reacts with water, perhaps not. Alternatively, maybe C is a metal oxide. Wait, if C is a metal oxide, say, Na2O, then reacting with water would give NaOH. But that's just one product. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: Maybe C is a nitride. For example, Mg3N2 reacts with water to produce Mg(OH)2 and NH3. But Mg(OH)2 is not an acid. Hmm, maybe not.

Wait, let's think about the reaction of C with water: produces A, F, and G. So maybe C is a compound that, when hydrolyzed, gives a metal, a strong acid, and a weak acid. That makes me think of something like a sulfite or perhaps a nitride. Alternatively, maybe a sulfate ester?

Wait, another possibility: C is a sulfate of a metal. For instance, suppose A is a metal, say, sodium. Then C could be Na2SO4. When Na2SO4 reacts with water, it just stays as Na2SO4. Hmm, no, that doesn't form acids. So that's probably not it.

Wait, maybe C is a sulfide. Let's think: When a sulfide reacts with water, it produces H2S (a weak acid) and the corresponding metal hydroxide. But if the metal hydroxide is strong, like NaOH, but wait, NaOH is a strong base, not an acid. So that doesn't fit F and G being acids.

Wait, maybe C is a nitrate. For example, Ca(NO3)2. When it reacts with water, it just stays as nitrate ions and Ca2+ ions. Not producing new acids.

Wait, perhaps C is a carbonate? Let me think. If C is a carbonate, say Na2CO3, and it reacts with water. Well, it's already in an aqueous solution, but maybe under certain conditions. Hmm, perhaps not.

Wait, perhaps C is a sulfite. For example, CaSO3. Reacting with water might produce H2SO3 (which is a weak acid, sulfurous acid) and Ca(OH)2. But Ca(OH)2 is a base, not an acid. So that might not fit.

Wait, another angle: Let's consider that when C reacts with water, it produces a strong acid and a weak acid. So perhaps C is a mixture of something that upon hydrolysis gives a strong acid and a weak one.

Hmm. Alternatively, maybe C is a compound like ammonium sulfate. When it reacts with water, it would just stay as ammonium and sulfate ions. Doesn't produce any new acids.

Wait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let's think about the other reaction: D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent. So D + B → H, 1:1 ratio. H is a solvent, so possible candidates are things like H2O, ethanol, etc. Wait, but D and B are gases. So perhaps H is something like HCl, but HCl is a gas, not a solvent. Wait, no. Alternatively, maybe H is NH3, which is a gas but can be a solvent? Or perhaps H is something like CH4, but that's not a solvent. Hmm.

Wait, D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent. So H is a liquid solvent. So possible options for H include H2O (but it's a liquid, but B could be O2 and D be H2, but 1:1 would produce H2O. Alternatively, B could be Cl2, D could be H2, producing HCl gas, which isn't a solvent. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe B is Cl2 and D is NH3? But NH3 is a gas and reacts with Cl2 in a 1:1 ratio to produce NH2Cl, which is not a solvent. Hmm. Not sure.

Wait, perhaps B is O2 and D is H2, so H is H2O. But H2O is a solvent, yes. So, D is H2. So the reaction would be 2H2 + O2 → 2H2O. But wait, the stoichiometry is 1:1. H2O is the product. So in that case, D is H2, B is O2, and H is H2O.

So, D is H2. So, in the reaction where C reacts with D, which is H2, in a 2 equivalent ratio. Hmm.

Wait, let's re-examine the reactions:

1. A + 8B → C (bright red)
2. C + 2D → E (extremely hazardous)
3. C + H2O → A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid)
4. D + B → H (solvent), 1:1 ratio.

So, from reaction 4, since H is a solvent, and D and B are gases, the most likely H is H2O. So in reaction 4, D and B produce H2O. That would mean D is H2 and B is O2. Because H2 + ½ O2 → H2O. But stoichiometry would be 2 moles H2 + 1 mole O2 → 2 moles H2O. So the ratio would be 2:1, but the question states a 1:1 ratio. Hmm, that's a problem.

Wait, maybe the reaction is B + D → H, in a 1:1 ratio. So, perhaps B is O2 and D is C (carbon monoxide?), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe B is Cl2 and D is CH4. But the reaction would be CH4 + 2Cl2 → CCl4 + 2HCl. So that's a 2:1 ratio. Doesn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe B is H2S and D is Cl2. They react in a 1:1 ratio: H2S + Cl2 → 2HCl + S. But H is S, which is a solid, not a solvent. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm, maybe B is NH3 and D is HCl. They react in a 1:1 ratio to form NH4Cl, which is a solid. So H would be NH4Cl, but that's not a solvent. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps B is O2 and D is C (carbon). They react to form CO, but that's a gas. Doesn't fit.

Alternatively, B is F2 and D is H2. They react to form HF. But HF is a liquid, a solvent. So reaction would be F2 + H2 → 2HF. So the ratio is 1:1 for D and B. So in this case, B is F2, D is H2, and H is HF, which is a solvent. That fits.

So, in reaction 4, F2 (B) + H2 (D) → 2HF (H). So the ratio is 1:1. So that works.

Then, moving to reaction 2: C reacts with 2 equivalents of D (H2) to produce E, which is extremely hazardous. So C + 2H2 → E. What reaction fits that?

Wait, if C is a compound that reacts with H2 to form something else. For example, maybe C is CO (carbon monoxide). So reaction would be CO + H2 → CH3OH. But that's methanol, not extremely hazardous. Alternatively, maybe C is a nitride, like NH3, but that's not reacting with H2 in such a way.

Wait, another possibility: If C is a sulfide, like CS2. Reacting with H2 might produce something else. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a carbonyl compound. Let's think about the first reaction: A (solid) + 8B (F2) → C. If B is F2, then reacting with A (maybe a metal) would form a fluoride. But 8 F2 per A? Let's see. For example, if A is calcium, Ca. 8 F2 would give CaF2. But CaF2 is not bright red. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: The first reaction produces a bright red product. I remember that sodium oxide (Na2O) is bright yellow, but perhaps another oxide. Wait, maybe it's something like Fe2O3, which is reddish. Or perhaps it's something like silver oxide (Ag2O), which is dark brown. Wait, perhaps it's a sulfide. The bright red could be mercury(II) sulfide, HgS, which is a bright red solid. So C is HgS.

Wait, if that's the case, let's see:

Reaction 1: A + 8B → HgS. So A is Hg, and B is S (but S is a solid, not a gas). Hmm, that might not fit because B is a gas. So B must be a diatomic gas like O2, Cl2, F2, etc.

Wait, if B is O2, then A would be a metal that reacts with O2 to form HgO. But HgO is not bright red. Wait, maybe A is Fe and B is O2. Fe reacts with O2 to form Fe3O4, which is black, or FeO which is black as well. Hmm, not bright red.

Alternatively, maybe B is another gas, perhaps Cl2. So if A is a metal, like copper, and B is Cl2, then reaction would be Cu + Cl2 → CuCl2. But CuCl2 is green, not red.

Wait, another approach: If C is a compound that when reacted with H2 (D) produces E, which is extremely hazardous. What's a reaction where a compound reacts with H2 to make something dangerous?

Extremely hazardous products could be things like sarin gas, or other nerve agents, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe E is something like hydrogen cyanide (HCN), but that's a possibility. Or perhaps E is phosgene, but that would require more specific reactions.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a carbonyl chloride, like COCl2. Reacting with H2 might produce something else, but I'm not sure.

Wait, if C is a carbonyl compound, such as CO, and D is H2, then the reaction would be the hydrogenation of CO to CH3OH. But that's not extremely hazardous.

Wait, perhaps E is a highly toxic gas like chlorine, but that would require C to be something else.

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting stuck here. Let's think about the third reaction again.

Reaction 3: C reacts with water to produce A, F, and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid.

So, if C is SO3 (sulfur trioxide), then reacting with water would give H2SO4 (strong acid) and possibly H2SO3 (but that's not stable; more likely, it would produce H2SO4 and H2O? Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, if C is a nitride, like NH3 (but that's not bright red). Wait, C is a solid, so maybe it's a metal nitride. For example, AlN. When AlN reacts with water, it produces Al(OH)3 and NH3. Al(OH)3 is amphoteric, but NH3 is a weak base. So that doesn't fit F and G being acids.

Wait, another possibility: C is a sulfite, like Na2SO3. When it reacts with water, perhaps under certain conditions, it can hydrolyze. But generally, sodium sulfite in water gives NaOH and H2SO3. But NaOH is a base, not an acid.

Hmm, maybe C is a sulfate, but that doesn't produce acids upon hydrolysis.

Wait, another idea: Maybe C is a mixed anhydride. For example, something like HSO4^- as part of a compound. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps C is a metal chloride. For instance, if C is AlCl3, which is a solid. Reacting with water would produce Al(OH)3 and HCl. HCl is a strong acid (F), and Al(OH)3 is amphoteric, but maybe in certain conditions, it could act as an acid. Wait, but Al(OH)3 is more of a weak base. Hmm.

Wait, but in the reaction, C + H2O → A + F + G. So, A is the metal, F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid.

So, if C is AlCl3, then reaction with water could be AlCl3 + 3H2O → Al(OH)3 + 3HCl. So, Al(OH)3 is a weak base, not an acid. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, what if C is a sulfite, like CaSO3. When it reacts with water, perhaps in acidic conditions, it could produce H2SO3 (weak acid) and Ca^2+ (which would form A as Ca? No, because A would be Ca metal, but CaSO3 is a salt, not a metal. Hmm, maybe not.

Wait, another angle: Let me think about the products of the first reaction, A + 8B → C. If B is F2, and A is a metal, like calcium. Then, Ca + 8 F2 → CaF2? But that would be 1:8 ratio, which is not common. Wait, calcium reacts with fluorine in a 1:1 ratio. Wait, no, the typical reaction is 2 Ca + 3 F2 → 2 CaF3? Or 2 Ca + 4 F2 → 2 CaF2 + F. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps B is O2, and A is a metal that forms an oxide with a 8:1 ratio. That seems unlikely.

Wait, perhaps B is Cl2 and A is a metal that reacts in 8 equivalents. For example, suppose A is Na, and B is Cl2. Then, 2 Na + Cl2 → NaCl. That's 2:1 ratio, not 8. Hmm.

Wait, maybe A is a transition metal. For example, iron. If B is Cl2, then 2 Fe + 3 Cl2 → 2 FeCl3. But again, 3 equivalents of Cl2 per 2 Fe, which is 1.5 per Fe. Not 8.

Hmm, perhaps I'm going about this the wrong way. Let's consider the possible options for E's molecular symmetry.

The options are C2, D4h, D∞h, and C2v.

Which of these are common for certain types of molecules?

C2 is a two-fold rotation axis. D4h is a dihedral group with a four-fold rotation and a horizontal mirror plane. D∞h is an infinite dihedral group, like in a linear molecule with symmetry. C2v is a two-fold rotation plus two vertical mirror planes.

Some common molecules:

- CO2: linear, so D∞h symmetry.
- H2O: bent, so C2v symmetry.
- NH3: trigonal pyramidal, so C3v symmetry. Not in the options.
- CH4: tetrahedral, Td symmetry. Not an option here.
- O2: diatomic, symmetry D∞h.
- O3: has a C2 symmetry? Or maybe D3h.
- SO2: bent, C2v symmetry.
- SF6: octahedral, Oh symmetry. Not in options.
- ClF3: trigonal pyramidal, C3v.

Wait, D4h symmetry is found in molecules like SO3 (trigonal pyramidal, but symmetry is C3v, not D4h). Hmm.

Wait, another example: I think benzene has D6h symmetry. So perhaps something with D4h symmetry is a molecule with a four-fold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane. Maybe something like a square planar molecule with a mirror plane.

Wait, but I'm getting off track. Let's think about what E is.

E is formed when C reacts with 2 equivalents of D. So C + 2D → E.

Assuming D is H2, as per reaction 4 (since D and B form H, which is a solvent, perhaps HF, but I'm not sure). Alternatively, if D is H2, then reaction 2 is C + 2H2 → E.

If C is a carbonyl compound, like CO, then CO + H2 → CH3OH, which is methanol. Methanol is toxic but not extremely hazardous. Hmm.

Alternatively, if C is a nitrile, like CN, then reaction with H2 might produce CH2NH2 or something else, but not sure.

Wait, another thought: If C is a carbonyl chloride, like COCl2. Reacting with H2 would produce what? Maybe CH2Cl2, but that's not extremely hazardous.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfide like CS2. Reacting with H2 could produce CH3SH, but that's not matching.

Wait, maybe C is a ketene, like (CO)2. Reacting with H2 could form something else, but not sure.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps C is a nitro compound. For example, if C is NO2. Reacting with H2 would produce HNO2, which is a weak acid, but not extremely hazardous.

Wait, another possibility: If C is a peroxide, like H2O2. Reacting with H2 would not make sense; perhaps it decomposes.

Wait, perhaps I should think about E being a highly toxic gas. For example, HCN is extremely toxic. Could E be HCN?

If E is HCN, then what would C and D be? HCN is formed by the reaction of, say, CH3CN with water, but that's not relevant here.

Wait, another approach. Let me think about the possible products.

If C is a sulfide, like HgS (bright red). Then, reaction with D (H2, as per reaction 4) would produce Hg and H2S. But Hg is a metal, so that wouldn't fit the reaction equation. Alternatively, HgS plus H2 might not react under normal conditions.

Wait, perhaps C is a metal oxide. Suppose C is Fe3O4, which is black, not red. Hmm.

Alternatively, C could be a nitride. For example, if C is Mg3N2, and D is H2. Then, Mg3N2 + H2 → MgH2 + NH3. But I don't know if that's correct.

Wait, but if E is NH3, which is toxic but not extremely hazardous. Also, NH3 is a gas and a solvent, but not sure.

Hmm, perhaps I'm stuck on E. Maybe I should think about the molecular symmetry based on the options.

The options are:

A) C2
B) D4h
C) D∞h
D) C2v

So, which of these is associated with a molecule that's a product of such reactions.

If E is a diatomic molecule, like O2 or Cl2, then it would have D∞h symmetry.

If E is a linear molecule, like CO2 or HCN, then D∞h.

If E is a bent molecule like H2O or SO2, then C2v.

If E is something with a mirror plane and a two-fold axis, perhaps D4h, which is more of a higher symmetry.

But what's E?

Wait, let's think about the extremely hazardous product E. Some extremely hazardous chemicals include sarin gas, VX, phosgene, hydrogen cyanide (HCN), chlorine gas, etc.

HCN is a linear molecule with D∞h symmetry, I think. Let's check: HCN is a linear molecule, so it has D∞h symmetry.

Phosgene (COCl2) is a bent molecule, so it would have C2v symmetry.

Chlorine gas is diatomic, so D∞h.

Wait, but E is formed from C reacting with D (H2) in reaction 2. So if E is HCN, then C would have to be something that reacts with H2 to form HCN. Not sure.

Wait, another extremely hazardous chemical is hydrogen sulfide (H2S), which is a bent molecule, so C2v symmetry.

Wait, another possibility: E is phosgene (O=CCl2). Phosgene has a structure similar to CO2 but with Cl instead of O. It's a toxic gas. Phosgene is a trigonal planar molecule. Wait, no, it's a planar molecule with a central carbon double-bonded to O and single-bonded to two Cl. So its structure is similar to CO2, which is linear. So, the symmetry is D∞h because it's linear. Wait, no. Wait, CO2 is linear, so D∞h. But phosgene, being similar, might have the same symmetry.

Wait, but wait: Phosgene's structure is O=C(Cl)2. So it's a planar molecule with two Cl atoms on either side. So the molecule is linear, O=C(Cl)Cl? No, no, it's O=C(Cl)2. So it's a trigonal planar structure? Or is it linear?

Wait, no, phosgene is O=C(Cl)2, which has a structure similar to CO2 but with two Cl substituting for O. So, it's a linear structure, since the central carbon is double-bonded to O and single-bonded to two Cl. So the molecule is linear, so it has D∞h symmetry.

Hmm, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, if E is HCN, which is linear, so D∞h symmetry. So the symmetry group would be D∞h, option C.

But earlier I thought reaction 2: C + 2D → E. If E is HCN, then what is C and D.

Wait, if D is H2, then reaction 2 would be C + 2 H2 → HCN. What would C be in that case? Maybe C is CH2N2 (diazomethane), which upon decomposition can produce HCN. But I'm not sure about the reaction.

Alternatively, maybe C is another compound. This is getting a bit too speculative.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to think about all the reactions once we have E's structure.

If E has D∞h symmetry, it's likely a linear molecule like CO2, HCN, or O2.

Wait, O2 is diatomic, D∞h. If E is O2, then in reaction 2, C reacts with D (H2) to form O2. That doesn't make sense because O2 is already a diatomic gas; it's not formed by reacting another compound with H2.

Wait, another possibility: E is CO, which is a linear molecule, D∞h symmetry. CO is a toxic gas but not extremely hazardous in the same way as, say, sarin. But it's possible.

So, let's say E is CO. Then, reaction 2 is C + 2 H2 → CO. What would C be? Maybe C is CH3OH (methanol), which upon dehydration could form CO, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a carbonate, but that doesn't fit.

Hmm. Another angle: The symmetry group of E is D∞h (option C), which is linear. So if E is a linear molecule, then it's likely a diatomic or triatomic linear molecule.

But given the options, maybe E is something like SO2, which is bent and has C2v symmetry.

Wait, SO2 is a bent molecule, so symmetry group is C2v. Which is option D.

But how would that fit into the reactions?

If E is SO2, then reaction 2 would be C + 2H2 → SO2.

What's C in that case? Maybe C is H2S, but H2S plus H2 doesn't produce SO2.

Wait, H2S is a gas, but in reaction 1, C is a bright red solid. H2S is a gas, so that doesn't fit.

Hmm. I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should try to find a different approach.

Let me try to think of C as a sulfide. For example, if C is CuS (bright red solid). Then reaction 3: CuS + H2O → Cu + H2S + something. Wait, but CuS is not very soluble in water. Alternatively, perhaps it's H2S and Cu(OH)2. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: If C is a metal carbonate. For example, CaCO3. But that's white, not bright red.

Hmm, maybe C is a sulfide of a transition metal. For example, FeS is black, not red. HgS is bright red. So C is HgS.

Then, reaction 3: HgS + H2O → Hg + H2S + something? No, because HgS doesn't hydrolyze that way. It might not react with water under normal conditions.

Wait, perhaps I'm way off track. Maybe I should think about the other parts.

Reaction 4: D + B → H (solvent), 1:1 ratio.

If H is H2O, then B and D must be O2 and H2, but their ratio is 1:1, which doesn't fit the reaction 2 H2 + ½ O2 → H2O, which is 2:1. So that doesn't work.

Wait, unless the reaction is 2 D + B → 2 H, so a 2:1 ratio, but the problem states 1:1. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, if H is NH3, which is a solvent. Then D and B must be something that react in 1:1 ratio to form NH3. For example, B could be HCl and D could be NH3, but that's a 1:1 ratio. Wait, but HCl is a gas and NH3 is a gas. They react to form NH4Cl, which is a solid, not a liquid solvent. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this.

Let me approach it from another angle. The products in reaction 3 are A, F (strong acid), and G (weak acid). So, A is a metal, and F and G are acids.

So when C reacts with water, it produces the metal A, and two acids. So perhaps C is a sulfide of a metal that reacts with water to produce the metal hydroxide, H2S (weak acid), and another acid. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: C is a mixed salt, like a metal bisulfate. For example, suppose C is Al2(SO4)3. Then, reacting with water would give Al(OH)3 and H2SO4. But Al(OH)3 is a base, not an acid. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps C is a sulfite, like Na2SO3. Reacting with water gives NaOH (strong base) and H2SO3 (weak acid). But again, the base doesn't fit F being a strong acid.

Hmm. Maybe C is a nitrate, but that doesn't produce acids upon hydrolysis.

Alternatively, think of C as a sulfite. Na2SO3 + H2O → 2 NaOH + H2SO3. So F would be NaOH (strong base), G would be H2SO3 (weak acid). But question says F is a strong acid and G is a weak acid.

Wait, so perhaps C is a different compound.

Wait, another thought: Maybe C is a carbonate. For example, Na2CO3. Reacting with water gives NaOH (strong base) and H2CO3 (weak acid). Again, same problem with F being a base.

Hmm. So far, I haven't found a compound that fits reaction 3.

Wait, perhaps C is a sulfuric acid anhydride. For example, when sulfur trioxide (SO3) reacts with water, it produces H2SO4 (strong acid). But we need three products: A, F, and G. So maybe if C is something like Na2SO4, but that doesn't produce acids.

Wait, perhaps C is a sulfite and a sulfate together. For example, a double salt. But not sure.

Wait, another approach: If F is a strong acid and G is a weak acid, perhaps they're HCl and H2S. Then, in reaction 3, C reacts with water to produce A (maybe metal), HCl, and H2S.

So, what compound would produce HCl and H2S upon hydrolysis? Maybe a sulfide of a metal that can form a hydrochloric acid.

Wait, but that seems complicated.

Wait, perhaps C is a sulfide of a metal that can react with water to produce H2S and the metal hydroxide. But then, the metal hydroxide isn't an acid. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: If C is a nitride, like Si3N4. Reacting with water would produce NH3 (weak base) and silicic acid (H4SiO4, weak acid). But that's not matching F and G as acids.

Hmm. This is getting a bit too challenging. Maybe it's better to make an educated guess based on the options.

Looking back, the options are about molecular symmetry groups. If E is a linear molecule, it's D∞h (option C). If it's bent, C2v (option D). If it's something like O2 (diatomic), same as D∞h. If it's a molecule with a two-fold axis, like H2O (but H2O is bent, so C2v).

Wait, but H2O is a solvent and has C2v symmetry.

Wait, but in reaction 4, D + B → H (solvent). If H is H2O, then D and B are H2 and O2. But their reaction is 2H2 + O2 → 2H2O, which is a 2:1 ratio, not 1:1. So that doesn't fit.

Unless the reaction is something else. Maybe B is F2 and D is H2. Then, F2 + H2 → 2HF. So 1:1 ratio. H is HF, which is a liquid and a solvent. So that works.

So, B is F2, D is H2.

Then, reaction 4: F2 + H2 → 2 HF. So H is HF, a solvent.

Now, reaction 3: C + H2O → A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid).

If C is something that reacts with water to produce a strong acid (F) and a weak acid (G), and the metal A.

Wait, perhaps C is a sulfite or a sulfide. Let me think.

If C is a sulfite, say, CaSO3. Then, CaSO3 + H2O → Ca(OH)2 + H2SO3. Ca(OH)2 is a base, not an acid. Doesn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe C is a sulfate. Wait, no, sulfate salts don't produce acids upon hydrolysis.

Wait, another thought: If C is a sulfide, like FeS. FeS reacts with water to produce Fe(OH)2 and H2S. Fe(OH)2 is a base, not an acid. So F and G wouldn't be acids.

Hmm. Maybe C is a nitride, like AlN. AlN + H2O → Al(OH)3 + NH3. Again, NH3 is a base, not acid.

Wait, perhaps C is a carbonate. Not likely, as it would produce a base.

Wait, maybe C is a perchlorate. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a compound that, when hydrolyzed, produces two acids. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: C is a sulfonic acid anhydride. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a peroxide, like H2O2. H2O2 decomposes into H2O and O2, but that doesn't fit the reaction.

Hmm.

Let me think about reaction 1: A + 8 B → C. B is F2, so reaction is A + 8 F2 → C.

If A is a metal like Ca, then Ca + 8 F2 → CaF2? But that would be a 1:2 ratio. Wait, no, the typical reaction is Ca + F2 → CaF2, 1:1. So 8 F2 per A doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps A is a transition metal that forms a higher fluoride. For example, perhaps A is Fe, and B is F2. Then, 2 Fe + 8 F2 → 4 FeF2. But I'm not sure if FeF2 is bright red.

Alternatively, perhaps C is FeF3. Not sure about color.

Hmm. Maybe another approach: If E has symmetry group D∞h (option C), which is linear. So E is a linear molecule. What linear molecules are extremely hazardous? CO, HCN, O2, etc.

If E is O2, then reaction 2 is C + 2 H2 → O2. But that doesn't make sense because O2 is already a diatomic gas.

Alternatively, E could be CO. Then, reaction 2 is C + 2 H2 → CO.

So, what would C be in that case?

Wait, maybe C is CH3OH (methanol), and upon heating with H2, it dehydrates to form CO and other products. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a hydrocarbon. But I'm not sure.

Hmm. Another angle: Since the problem is about molecular symmetry, perhaps E is a diatomic molecule, which has D∞h symmetry. So if E is a diatomic gas like O2 or Cl2, then its symmetry group is D∞h (option C). So the correct answer might be option C.

But I'm not entirely certain, but given the options and the context, it seems plausible.

The problem involves determining the molecular symmetry group of product E based on a series of reactions. Here's the analysis:

1. **Reaction 1**: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. The stoichiometry (1:8) and the bright red color suggest that B could be a diatomic gas like F₂, and A could be a metal that forms a fluoride. However, the exact identity of A and C remains unclear.

2. **Reaction 2**: C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce E, an extremely hazardous product. D is identified as H₂ based on reaction 4, where D and B react in a 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent. If B is F₂, then D + B → H suggests that H is HF, a solvent. Thus, D is H₂.

3. **Reaction 3**: C reacts with water to produce A, F (a strong acid), and G (a weak acid). This indicates that C must hydrolyze to yield a metal (A), a strong acid (F), and a weak acid (G). However, the exact identity of C remains uncertain.

4. **Reaction 4**: D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent. If B is F₂ and D is H₂, then H is HF, a liquid solvent, which fits the 1:1 stoichiometry.

5. **Symmetry of E**: The options for the molecular symmetry group are C₂, D₄h, D∞h, and C₂v. If E is a linear molecule like CO, HCN, or O₂, it would have D∞h symmetry. If E is a bent molecule like H₂O or SO₂, it would have C₂v symmetry. Given that E is described as extremely hazardous, CO or HCN are plausible candidates, both of which are linear and have D∞h symmetry.

Based on the reasoning, the most likely symmetry group of E is **D∞h**, as it is consistent with a linear molecule like CO or HCN.
