Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let me take it step by step.

The question involves several reactions leading from 1,3-dibromoadamantane to product 3, and then determining the coupling pattern in the NMR of product 3.

First, let's break down each step.

1. **Heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with excess KOH at 240Â°C**:
   I remember that when dibromides react with strong bases like KOH, elimination reactions can occur, especially if the base is in excess and the conditions are heated. Since adamantane is a highly branched, diamondoid structure, the bromines are in specific positions. Heating with KOH would likely lead to an E2 elimination, forming an alkene. The product here is a light yellow solid, which suggests it's probably an alkene, as alkenes can be yellow solids sometimes. The IR spectrum shows a peak at 1720 cm-1. Wait, that region is usually for carbonyl groups. Hmm, but the product is formed from elimination. Oh wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. Alternatively, maybe the initial reaction is a dehydrohalogenation forming an alkene. But wait, the IR is showing 1720, which is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So maybe I'm wrong. Another possibility is that KOH in such conditions could lead to dehydrohalogenation, but perhaps with more than two eliminations? Alternatively, maybe the initial reaction is a di-elimination, forming a ketone? Wait, no, elimination usually forms alkenes. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is more of a dehydrohalogenation leading to a diene or something else. Wait, another thought: maybe the initial product is a ketone. How? Oh, wait, maybe it's a double elimination, but that seems less likely. Alternatively, perhaps the structure undergoes a ring-opening or some rearrangement. Alternatively, maybe the KOH is causing a neighboring group participation or some kind of elimination followed by a keto-enol type tautomerism. Hmm, this is confusing.

   Alternatively, considering the structure of 1,3-dibromoadamantane. The adamantane structure has four fused cyclohexane rings. The 1 and 3 positions are on adjacent carbons. When KOH is used, perhaps each Br is eliminated, but how? Each Br is in a position where elimination would form a double bond. But since it's 1,3-dibromoadamantane, perhaps the two Brs are on adjacent carbons. Wait, no, in adamantane, the 1 and 3 positions are actually on the same face but perhaps not directly adjacent. Wait, maybe the positions are such that elimination can occur, but perhaps the mechanism leads to the formation of a ketone. Wait no, elimination would form an alkene, but maybe I'm missing something.

   Let me think again: 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have two Br atoms on adjacent carbons in the adamantane structure. When treated with KOH, an E2 mechanism would form a double bond. So the product would be 1,3-didehydroadamatane, which would be an alkene. But wait, the IR shows a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is more typical of a carbonyl group (like a ketone). Hmm, that doesn't fit with an alkene, which has C=C stretching around 1650 cm-1. So maybe the product isn't an alkene. What else could happen?

   Oh wait, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation followed by some rearrangement. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is more of a substitution. But KOH is a strong base, so substitution would require a good leaving group, which Br is. But substitution would require a nucleophile, which KOH provides (OH-), but in E2 conditions, which are more about elimination. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a double elimination, but that would form a conjugated diene, which wouldn't explain the IR peak at 1720.

   Wait, another thought: maybe the initial product is a ketone. How? If each Br is removed and a carbonyl forms. But that doesn't seem straightforward. Unless the structure rearranges. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a double dehydrohalogenation, where each Br is removed, and the adjacent carbons form a carbonyl. Wait, but that would require two eliminations, which is possible if there are two leaving groups. Hmm, perhaps the two Br atoms are on adjacent carbons, and upon elimination, a double bond forms. But again, that would lead to an alkene, not a carbonyl.

   Alternatively, perhaps the KOH isn't just eliminating but causing a ring expansion or some kind of rearrangement. Wait, adamantane is a very rigid structure. Maybe the elimination leads to a bridgehead double bond, which is possible but perhaps not the case here.

   Let me check the NMR data for product 1. The 1H NMR shows peaks at 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). The 4.79 ppm peak is upfield for an alkene proton, but wait, that region is more typical for an alcohol, maybe an -OH, but wait, it's 2H, so maybe it's a diol? Or perhaps an epoxide? Or maybe a CH2 adjacent to an oxygen.

   Alternatively, if the product after KOH is a ketone, then the NMR wouldn't show protons in that region. But the 1H NMR has a 4.79 ppm peak for 2H. Maybe it's an epoxide, which typically has protons around 3.5-4.5 ppm. Or perhaps it's a diol. Wait, but KOH is a strong base, and after elimination, perhaps product 1 is an alcohol. No, because elimination would form an alkene, not an alcohol. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a diol from a substitution, but substitution would require a good leaving group and a nucleophile. But with KOH, substitution would lead to a carboxylate if another group is present, but that doesn't fit.

   I'm a bit stuck here. Let me think again. The IR shows a strong peak at 1720 cm-1, which is indicative of a carbonyl group, like a ketone. So maybe the product is a ketone. But how does that happen from 1,3-dibromoadamantane and KOH?

   Oh! Wait a minute. Maybe the reaction is a double elimination, but leading to a carbonyl. For example, if two adjacent bromides are present, and both are eliminated, perhaps via a conjugated process. Wait, but elimination typically forms a double bond, not a carbonyl.

   Alternatively, perhaps each Br is replaced by an -OH group, but that would require a substitution reaction, which under basic conditions is less likely. Unless it's a SN2 reaction, but with two Br atoms, perhaps leading to a vicinal diol.

   Wait, if the product is a vicinal diol, then the NMR would have peaks for the -OH protons, but in the data, the 4.79 ppm is given as 2H. That could fit with two adjacent OH groups, but that would require the diol to be in a certain environment. Wait, but in the presence of KOH, which is a strong base, the diol would probably deprotonate, but perhaps the sample was taken before neutralization, so the OH protons are present. But in the NMR, the peak at 4.79 ppm is 2H. Alternatively, maybe it's an epoxide, which would have two protons in a specific coupling pattern.

   Alternatively, perhaps the product is an epoxide. Wait, but how would KOH form an epoxide? Epoxidation typically involves peracids or other epoxidizing agents. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction isn't an elimination but a substitution to form a diol, and then some kind of cyclization occurs. But I'm not sure.

   Let's think about the IR again. 1720 cm-1 is a strong carbonyl. So maybe the product is a ketone. But how to form a ketone from 1,3-dibromoadamantane and KOH. Another possibility is that the two Br atoms are eliminated, and the adjacent carbons form a carbonyl. Wait, that would require two eliminations, each leading to a carbonyl group. But that seems unlikely because each elimination would typically form a double bond, not a carbonyl.

   Hmm, perhaps I should consider another approach. Let's think about the structure of 1,3-dibromoadamantane. The adamantane structure has a central carbon with four cyclohexane rings attached. The 1 and 3 positions are on adjacent carbons on the same face. So when KOH is added, each Br leaves, and the adjacent hydrogens are abstracted by the base, leading to the formation of double bonds. But wait, if each Br is removed, perhaps the two adjacent carbons form a double bond, leading to a structure with a bridgehead double bond. But bridgehead double bonds are generally not very stable, but in adamantane, the structure is rigid, so it might be possible.

   So product 1 is an adamantane derivative with a double bond. Then, the IR doesn't show a carbonyl, but the given IR shows a peak at 1720, so maybe I'm wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the initial reaction forms a diol, but that doesn't explain the IR. Alternatively, perhaps the product is something else.

   Wait, perhaps the IR peak is not from a carbonyl. What else absorbs around 1720 cm-1? Maybe an ester or an alkyne? No, alkynes are around 2200. Esters are around 1730-1740. But the product is made from KOH, which is a strong base, so an ester is unlikely. Alternatively, maybe it's a conjugated carbonyl or something else.

   Another possibility: the product is a ketone formed via elimination and rearrangement. For example, if the two Br atoms are eliminated, and the resulting structure rearranges to form a ketone. But I'm not sure about the mechanism for that.

   Alternatively, perhaps it's a hemiacetal or something else, but that seems less likely.

   Hmm, maybe I should proceed to the next steps and see if that helps. Let me think about product 2.

2. **Heating product 1 with excess aluminum isopropoxide**:
   Aluminum isopropoxide (Al(OiPr)3) is often used as a Lewis acid catalyst, especially in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. But product 1's structure is unclear yet. If product 1 is an alkene, then heating with Al isopropoxide might protonate it, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, if product 1 is a ketone, then perhaps it undergoes some kind of alkylation or acylation.

   Wait, product 1's IR has a peak at 1720. Let's suppose that product 1 is a ketone. Then, heating with Al isopropoxide might cause the ketone to undergo some kind of reaction. Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an epoxide, which upon heating with a Lewis acid could undergo ring-opening.

   But I'm not sure. Maybe I should first figure out product 1 correctly.

   Let me think again about product 1. The 1H NMR shows 4.79 ppm (2H), which is a singlet. The other peaks are around 2.41-2.23 (10H) and 1.94 (2H). The 4.79 ppm is likely a CH2 group. If it's an epoxide, the CH2 would be adjacent to the oxygen, giving two protons with a coupling pattern. Alternatively, it could be a diol.

   If product 1 is an epoxide, then when Al isopropoxide is added, perhaps it protonates the epoxide, making it more electrophilic. But what would happen when an epoxide is heated with Al isopropoxide? Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diol, and when heated with Al isopropoxide, which is a Lewis acid, it could dehydrate the diol to form a carbonyl group.

   Wait, but product 1's IR has a peak at 1720, which is a carbonyl. Oh, wait, maybe product 1 is a diol, and when heated with Al isopropoxide, it loses water to form a ketone.

   Let me piece this together. Suppose product 1 is a diol (vicinal diol) from the substitution of the two Br atoms with hydroxyl groups. Then, when heated with Al isopropoxide, which is a strong Lewis acid, it could facilitate the elimination of water from the diol, forming a carbonyl group. So product 2 would be a ketone.

   The IR of product 1 has a peak at 1720, which fits a ketone. So that must be product 2. Wait, no, product 1 is the initial product. Wait, initial product is product 1, then product 2 is formed by heating product 1 with Al isopropoxide. So perhaps product 1 is the diol, and product 2 is the ketone formed via dehydration.

   So, product 1: vicinal diol.

   Then, product 2: ketone.

   Let's see. If product 2 is a ketone, what's its structure? It would be a ketone in the adamantane structure. Then, in step 3, ozone is bubbled through product 2 at -78Â°C, followed by dimethyl sulfide. Ozonolysis is typically used to cleave alkenes into carbonyl groups. But product 2 is a ketone. Hmm, so maybe product 2 is an alkene. Wait, I'm getting confused again.

   Let me try to reevaluate. If product 1 is an alkene (from elimination), then product 2 would be the result of a reaction with Al isopropoxide. If product 1 is an alkene, perhaps product 2 is an epoxide. Because Al isopropoxide can protonate the alkene, making it more reactive towards epoxidation, but I'm not sure if that's the case.

   Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an epoxide. Then, product 2 could be the result of some ring-opening. But I'm not sure.

   Alternatively, perhaps the initial reaction is elimination to form an alkene (product 1), which then undergoes some reaction with Al isopropoxide to form a diol or another structure. But I'm not sure.

   Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an alcohol, but I'm not getting it right.

   Maybe I should think about the NMR of product 1. The 4.79 ppm is a singlet of 2H. If it's an epoxide, the two protons would typically be a triplet due to coupling with each other. But in the NMR, it's a singlet, so that might not fit. Alternatively, if it's a CH2 group adjacent to an electronegative atom, like O, that could explain the shift.

   Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a geminal diol, but that would have a different NMR pattern.

   Hmm, this is tricky. Let me try to think of the overall process.

   The initial reaction is dehydrohalogenation, forming an alkene. Then, product 2 is formed by heating with Al isopropoxide, which could be a Friedel-Crafts catalyst. So product 2 might be a more substituted alkene, but I'm not certain.

   Then, product 2 undergoes ozonolysis. Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds, so product 2 must have a double bond. Ozonolysis at -78Â°C (which is a standard condition) would form ozonides, which upon workup (with dimethyl sulfide) would cleave into carbonyl groups. So product 3 would be a dialdehyde or diketone, depending on the substituents adjacent to the double bond.

   Now, the question is about the NMR of product 3. The most deshielded proton (which is usually the most downfield-shifted) would be adjacent to the carbonyl group, perhaps as an aldehyde proton. But aldehyde protons appear around 9-10 ppm, but the options don't mention that. Alternatively, the most deshielded could be a vinylic proton, but that would be less likely after ozonolysis, which cleaves double bonds.

   Wait, no. Product 3 is the result of ozonolysis, which breaks the double bond. So in product 3, there are no more double bonds. Therefore, any vinylic protons would have been consumed. So the most deshielded protons would be from the carbonyl groups, but carbonyl groups don't have protons. Therefore, the most deshielded protons would probably be adjacent to the carbonyl groups, perhaps as CH2 or CH groups.

   Alternatively, perhaps the structure after ozonolysis is a diketone, or maybe two carbonyl groups with some adjacent CH2 groups.

   Let me try to outline the structures:

   - Starting material: 1,3-dibromoadamantane.

   - Step 1: elimination with KOH â forms an alkene. So product 1 is an alkene.

   - Step 2: product 1 is heated with Al isopropoxide. Al isopropoxide is a Lewis acid, often used in Friedel-Crafts. But if product 1 is an alkene, perhaps it undergoes some kind of reaction. Alternatively, perhaps it's a di-elimination leading to a conjugated diene, but that's unclear.

   Wait, perhaps product 1 is a vicinal diol. Then, when heated with Al isopropoxide, the diol loses water to form a ketone (product 2). Then, product 2 is a ketone. Ozonolysis is typically for alkenes, so product 2 must have a double bond. So perhaps product 2 is an alkene.

   Let me reevaluate step 1. If 1,3-dibromoadamantane is treated with KOH, perhaps each Br is eliminated, leading to an alkene. So product 1 is an alkene. The IR shows 1720, which doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe the initial product is a diol, product 1.

   Alternatively, perhaps the initial reaction is a double elimination, but forms a ketone via some mechanism. I'm confused.

   Let me think about the NMR of product 1. 4.79 ppm (2H) could be a CH2 next to an oxygen, as in an epoxide or an ether. Let's say it's an epoxide. Then, the 10H between 2.41-2.23 ppm would be the protons on the adamantane structure adjacent to the epoxide. The 1.94 ppm (2H) might be another set of protons on the adamantane.

   So, product 1 is an epoxide. Then, when treated with Al isopropoxide, perhaps it undergoes some kind of acid-catalyzed ring-opening. But I'm not sure what product that would form. Alternatively, perhaps the epoxide is protonated, leading to ring-opening, but without more info, it's hard to say.

   Alternatively, if product 1 is a diol (vicinal diol), then product 2 would be a ketone after dehydration with Al isopropoxide. Then, product 2 is the ketone.

   Then, product 2 is treated with ozone. Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds, but if product 2 is a ketone, it doesn't have a double bond. So that wouldn't make sense. Therefore, my assumption must be wrong.

   Hmm, perhaps product 1 is the alkene, and product 2 is an epoxide. Then product 2 is an epoxide, which upon ozonolysis would be cleaved. But ozonolysis is for alkenes, so that doesn't make sense either.

   Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is an alkene, and the ozonolysis is on that. So product 3 would have carbonyl groups.

   Let me try to outline this:

   - Step 1: 1,3-dibromo â elimination â alkene (product 1).

   - Step 2: product 1 â reacts with Al isopropoxide â perhaps adds something? Or maybe it's a Friedel-Crafts alkylation, but on what? If product 1 is an alkene, maybe Al isopropoxide is a catalyst for some addition.

   Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an alkene, and product 2 is a diol formed by some addition, but I'm not certain.

   Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an epoxide, and product 2 is a diol. But that's speculative.

   I think I'm getting stuck on the first step. Let me try to think of the possible products.

   Considering that the IR of product 1 shows a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is indicative of a carbonyl group, perhaps product 1 is a ketone. But how does that happen from 1,3-dibromoadamantane and KOH?

   Wait, maybe the KOH is causing a double elimination, and the two Br atoms are removed, leading to the formation of a carbonyl group. For example, if each Br is on a carbon adjacent to another Br, their elimination would lead to a conjugated diene, but that doesn't explain the carbonyl. Alternatively, perhaps each Br is eliminated, and each adjacent C-O forms, creating a carbonyl group. But I don't know the exact mechanism.

   Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, and upon treatment with KOH, each Br is eliminated as HBr, and the carbons bond to each other, forming a carbonyl group. Like, CH2Br-CH2Br â CH2=CH2, but in this case, the carbons are part of the adamantane structure. So perhaps the two adjacent carbons each lose Br and form a double bond, but that would still give an alkene, not a ketone.

   Wait, perhaps the KOH is causing the formation of a ketone via a different mechanism, like a pinacol rearrangement. The pinacol rearrangement involves the elimination of water from a vicinal diol to form a carbonyl. So, if product 1 is a vicinal diol, then product 2 would be a ketone after dehydration. But how does KOH lead to the diol?

   Oh, wait! If 1,3-dibromoadamantane is treated with KOH, perhaps each Br is replaced by an OH group via substitution, forming a vicinal diol. Then, the diol would have two OH groups on adjacent carbons. So product 1 is the diol.

   Then, when product 1 is heated with Al isopropoxide (a Lewis acid catalyst), it would dehydrate the diol, forming a ketone. That would explain the IR peak at 1720 cm-1 for product 2.

   So, product 2 is a ketone. Then, in the next step, product 2 undergoes ozonolysis. But wait, ozonolysis targets double bonds, not ketones. So this suggests that product 2 must have a double bond. Which contradicts our earlier assumption. Therefore, perhaps the initial assumption is wrong.

   Alternatively, if product 2 is a ketone, then ozonolysis wouldn't affect it. So perhaps product 2 isn't the ketone but another structure with a double bond.

   Let me reevaluate. Suppose product 1 is the vicinal diol (from KOH substitution). Then, product 2 is formed by heating with Al isopropoxide, which could dehydrate the diol to form a ketone. But then, product 2 is a ketone, which doesn't have a double bond. So ozonolysis can't act on it. Therefore, perhaps product 2 isn't the ketone but another structure with a double bond.

   Alternatively, maybe product 1 is an alkene, and Al isopropoxide is causing some kind of addition or modification to form a diol or another structure with a double bond.

   I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to think about the ozonolysis step. Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds into carbonyl groups. So product 2 must have a double bond. Therefore, product 2 must be an alkene. So the previous steps must lead to an alkene.

   So, step 1: elimination of HBr to form an alkene (product 1).

   Step 2: product 1 is treated with Al isopropoxide â perhaps nothing happens? Or maybe it's a di-elimination to form a diene. Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclopropane formation, but that's a stretch.

   Alternatively, perhaps Al isopropoxide acts as a catalyst for some kind of [2+2] addition, but that's not common.

   Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an alkene, and product 2 is an epoxide. Then, product 2 undergoes ozonolysis. But ozonolysis of an epoxide? No, ozonolysis is for alkenes.

   Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is a diene. Then ozonolysis would cleave each double bond into carbonyl groups. But I'm not sure.

   Let me try to outline all steps again:

   1,3-dibromoadamantane â KOH, heat â product 1 (light yellow solid, IR 1720 cm-1).

   If product 1 is an alkene, then the IR shouldn't have a strong peak at 1720 cm-1. Unless it's a conjugated diene, which could have a lower wavenumber for the C=C. But 1720 is higher, so more likely a carbonyl.

   Therefore, product 1 must have a carbonyl group. So step 1 leads to a ketone. How?

   1,3-dibromoadamantane â elimination of two HBr molecules, forming a ketone. How? Each Br is on adjacent carbons. So when both are eliminated, perhaps the two carbons form a carbonyl group.

   Wait, perhaps the structure is such that eliminating two HBr groups leads to the formation of a carbonyl. Let's imagine:

   BrâCâCâBr â after elimination, becomes O=CâCâ ?

   Wait, no. Alternatively, perhaps the two adjacent carbons each lose a Br, and the two carbons become double-bonded to each other, but that would form an alkene, not a ketone.

   Hmm, perhaps the elimination leads to a conjugated diene, and then some kind of keto-enol tautomerism forms a ketone. But I'm not sure.

   Alternatively, perhaps each Br is replaced by an OH group, forming a diol. Then, the diol undergoes dehydration to form a ketone, but that would require more steps.

   Alternatively, perhaps the initial reaction forms a diketone. But I'm not sure.

   Since I'm stuck, perhaps I should look for another approach. Let's consider the NMR of product 3, which is the final product after ozonolysis.

   Ozonolysis of an alkene typically forms carbonyl compounds. So, if product 2 is an alkene, product 3 would have carbonyl groups. The most deshielded proton in product 3 would be adjacent to a carbonyl group, possibly as a CH2 group or a CH group.

   The coupling pattern depends on the neighboring protons. For example, if a CH2 is next to a CH group, each proton in CH2 would couple with the two protons of the CH group, leading to a triplet of triplets or something similar.

   Alternatively, perhaps the deshielded proton is part of a CH2 group adjacent to two other CH2 groups, leading to a triplet.

   The options are:

   A) triplet
   B) triplet of triplets
   C) doublet of triplets
   D) pentet

   So, I need to determine the coupling pattern of the most deshielded proton in product 3.

   Let's imagine that product 2 is a simple alkene, say, CH2=CH-R. Upon ozonolysis, this would break into two carbonyl compounds. For example, if product 2 is CH2=CH-R, ozonolysis would give RCHO and another aldehyde or ketone, depending on the structure.

   Alternatively, if product 2 is a terminal alkene, ozonolysis would give a carbonyl and possibly a smaller fragment.

   Let's say product 2 is a simple alkene, like CH2=CH-Adamantane. Ozonolysis would break the double bond into two carbonyl groups. So product 3 would have two carbonyl groups, each attached to a CH2 group.

   The structure would be O=CH-CH2-Adamantane? No, perhaps more accurately, each end would have a carbonyl.

   Wait, no. Ozonolysis of a simple alkene like CH2=CH2 would give two formaldehyde molecules. But in this case, the alkene is part of the adamantane structure, so it's probably more complex.

   Alternatively, product 2 could be a trisubstituted or tetrasubstituted alkene. Ozonolysis would cleave it into two carbonyl compounds.

   Let's imagine product 3 has a structure where a CH2 group is adjacent to a carbonyl group. Each proton in the CH2 would be split by coupling with neighboring protons.

   Suppose the structure is something like:

   O=C-R-CH2-CHO

   Wait, no. Alternatively, perhaps it's a diketone, like R-CO-CH2-CO-R'.

   But that depends on the structure of product 2.

   Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is an internal alkene, leading to two carbonyl groups attached to the adamantane structure.

   Let me think about the coupling. The most deshielded proton would be one that's next to the carbonyl group. For example, a CH2 adjacent to a carbonyl would have each H coupling with the two H on the adjacent CH2 group, leading to a triplet.

   Alternatively, if the CH2 is next to another CH2 group, which is next to another, the coupling could be more complex.

   Wait, but in ozonolysis, the double bond is cleaved, so the adjacent groups would be carbonyls. Let me think about a specific example.

   Suppose product 2 is an alkene: R-CH2-CH2-R'. Ozonolysis would break this into R-CHO and R'-CHO. But that's for a simple internal alkene.

   Alternatively, if the alkene is part of a more complex structure, like R-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-R', ozonolysis would cleave into two aldehydes.

   But in the case of adamantane, the structure is more rigid. Let's imagine that product 2 is an alkene in such a way that ozonolysis produces two carbonyl groups attached to CH2 groups.

   For example, suppose product 2 is:

   Adamantyl-CH2-CH2-Adamantyl

   But that's not an alkene. Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is:

   Adamantyl-CH2-CH2-Adamatyl

   No, that's not an alkene. Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is:

   Adamantyl-CH2-CH2-Adamantyl â but that's a single bond.

   Wait, no. Product 2 must have a double bond, so perhaps it's:

   Adamantyl-CH2-CH2-Adamantyl â no, that's a single bond. Alternatively, maybe it's:

   Adamantyl-CH2-CH2-CH2-Adamantyl â but again, no double bond.

   I'm getting stuck on visualizing the structure. Let me try to think differently.

   The NMR of product 3: The most deshielded proton is probably adjacent to a carbonyl. Let's say it's a CH2 group next to a carbonyl. Each H in CH2 would be split by neighboring Hs.

   For example, if the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-C=O, then each CH2 would have two neighboring Hs. The central CH2 would be split by both adjacent CH2 groups, leading to a more complex coupling.

   Wait, but ozonolysis of a symmetrical alkene would give two identical carbonyl compounds. So perhaps the structure is such that after cleavage, each carbonyl is attached to a CH2 group.

   For example, ozonolysis of a symmetrical internal alkene (R-CH2-CH2-R) would yield two R-CHO compounds. But in this case, the R groups are part of the adamantane structure.

   Alternatively, perhaps the alkene is such that ozonolysis gives two aldehyde groups attached to a CH2 group. For example, HOCH2-CHO.

   Wait, but that's for a simple alkene. In our case, the structure is more complex, so perhaps each carbonyl is part of a larger structure.

   Let me think about the coupling. Suppose the most deshielded proton is part of a CH2 group next to a carbonyl. Let's say the structure is O=C-R-CH2-X. The CH2-X group would have protons that are adjacent to the CH2 group next to the carbonyl.

   The coupling would depend on how many neighboring protons are present. If the CH2 is next to another CH2 group, each proton would split into a triplet (coupling with two neighboring Hs). But if there are more neighbors, the splitting becomes more complex.

   Alternatively, if the CH2 is next to a CH group, which is next to another CH2, the coupling would be a triplet of triplets, which is option B.

   Wait, but the options are A) triplet, B) triplet of triplets, C) doublet of triplets, D) pentet.

   So, the most deshielded proton is likely in a CH2 group adjacent to another CH2 group, which in turn is adjacent to another CH2. But perhaps it's more complex.

   Alternatively, perhaps the structure has a CH2 group next to a CH that's split into a triplet due to coupling with two other Hs.

   Let me think of a specific structure. Suppose product 3 has a structure like O=C-CH2-CH2-CHO. Then, the central CH2 would be between two CH2 groups. Each H in the central CH2 would be split by the neighboring CH2 groups on both sides.

   Each H in the central CH2 would be adjacent to two Hs on each side, leading to a quartet. But wait, that's for each side. Wait, no, each H in the central CH2 would couple with the two Hs on each adjacent CH2.

   So, each H in the central CH2 would have two neighboring Hs on each side. So the coupling would be with four Hs (two on each side), leading to a quintet (pentet). But wait, that's if all four Hs are equivalent. Alternatively, if the coupling is from two different sets, it might be a triplet of triplets.

   Alternatively, perhaps the CH2 is adjacent to a CH group which is coupled to another CH group, leading to a more complex splitting.

   Alternatively, perhaps the most deshielded proton is part of a CH2 group next to a CH group, which is next to another CH2 group. Each proton in the CH2 would couple with the two Hs in the adjacent CH group and the two Hs in the next CH2 group. But that seems unlikely.

   Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the CH2 is next to a single CH group. So each H in the CH2 would couple with the two Hs in the CH group, leading to a triplet.

   For example, if the structure is O=C-CH2-CH(CH3)-CHO. Then, the CH2 next to the carbonyl would be adjacent to a CH group. Each H in the CH2 would couple with the two Hs in the CH group, resulting in a triplet.

   But that would fit option A, a triplet.

   Alternatively, if the CH2 is adjacent to another CH2, which is adjacent to another CH2, each H in the middle CH2 would couple with four Hs, leading to a pentet (option D).

   But I'm not sure. Alternatively, if the CH2 is next to a CH group which is next to another CH group, each H in the CH2 would couple with two Hs from the first CH and two Hs from the second CH, leading to a triplet of triplets.

   That would be option B.

   Hmm, I'm not certain. Let me try to think about the possible structures again.

   Since the problem involves ozonolysis, the product 3 must have carbonyl groups. The most deshielded proton would be adjacent to a carbonyl, perhaps as part of a CH2 group.

   Let's imagine product 3 has a structure like R-CO-CH2-CHO. Then, the CH2 group between the two carbonyls would have each H coupling with the two Hs on either side. Wait, but in this case, the CH2 is between two aldehydes. So each H in CH2 would be next to a CH(O) group, which doesn't have Hs. Wait, no, perhaps the structure is R-CO-CH2-CH2-CO-R'. Then, the middle CH2 would be next to two CH2 groups, each with two Hs. That would cause each H in the middle CH2 to couple with four Hs, leading to a quintet (option D).

   Alternatively, perhaps the structure is R-CO-CH2-CHO. Then, the CH2 is next to a CHO group (no Hs) and another group. So the CH2 would only couple with Hs from one side, perhaps leading to a triplet.

   Alternatively, if the structure is R-CO-CH2-CH2-CHO, the middle CH2 would be between two CH2 groups. Each H in the middle would couple with four Hs, leading to a pentet (option D).

   But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the CH2 is part of a CH2-CHO group, so each H in CH2 would couple with the two Hs in the adjacent CH2 group. That would lead to a triplet.

   Another approach: The most deshielded proton is likely to be on a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl group. Let's say that CH2 group is next to another CH2 group which itself is adjacent to another CH2 group. Each H in the middle CH2 would be split by the two Hs on each side, leading to a quartet (but quartet isn't an option). Alternatively, if the middle CH2 is adjacent to two different CH2 groups, each with two Hs, the coupling would be a triplet of triplets.

   Alternatively, perhaps the most deshielded proton is part of a CH2 group that is next to a CH group which is next to another CH2 group. Each H in the CH2 would couple with the two Hs in the CH group and the two Hs in the adjacent CH2 group. That would result in a triplet of triplets (option B).

   Alternatively, maybe the structure is such that the CH2 is part of a -CH2-CHO group, and the adjacent group is a -CH2- group. So each H in the CH2 would couple with the two Hs in the adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet.

   But without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to be certain.

   Let me think about the initial NMR data for product 1. The 4.79 ppm (2H) could be a CH2 group adjacent to an oxygen, such as an epoxide. Then, product 2 might be an diol or something else.

   Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diol, product 2 is a ketone, and product 3 is the result of ozonolysis. But that doesn't fit because ozonolysis targets double bonds.

   I'm getting stuck again. Maybe I should try to think about the coupling in product 3.

   The most deshielded proton would be adjacent to a carbonyl group. Let's say it's a CH2 group next to a carbonyl. Each H in that CH2 would be split by neighboring Hs.

   If the CH2 is next to another CH2 group, each H would couple with two Hs, leading to a triplet. If the CH2 is next to a CH group, which is next to another CH2, the coupling would be more complex.

   For example, if the structure is O=C-CH2-CH(CH2X)-CHO, each H in the middle CH2 would couple with the two Hs in the adjacent CH group and the two Hs in the next CH2 group. That would give a triplet of triplets (option B).

   Alternatively, perhaps the CH2 is between two CH groups, each with two Hs. That would lead to a triplet of triplets.

   Another scenario: the CH2 is surrounded by two CH2 groups on each side. Each H in the middle would couple with four Hs (two on each side), leading to a quintet (option D). But that's less likely if the structure is symmetric.

   Alternatively, perhaps the CH2 is next to a single CH group, leading to a triplet (option A).

   Since the options are limited, and considering the most likely scenario, I think the coupling would be a triplet of triplets, which is option B. Because the CH2 would be adjacent to a CH group, which itself is adjacent to another CH group, leading to two couplings each with two Hs, resulting in a triplet of triplets.

The problem involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane, leading to product 3, and determining the coupling pattern of the most deshielded proton in the Â¹H NMR spectrum of product 3. Here's the analysis:

1. **Reaction 1: Heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH**  
   The reaction likely involves elimination of two HBr molecules, forming an alkene (product 1). The IR spectrum of product 1 shows a peak at 1720 cmâ»Â¹, which is characteristic of a carbonyl group. This suggests that the initial elimination forms a ketone, possibly through a rearrangement or tautomerism.

2. **Reaction 2: Heating product 1 with aluminum isopropoxide**  
   Aluminum isopropoxide, a Lewis acid, likely facilitates further reaction. Given the IR data and the structure of the starting material, product 2 is inferred to be an alkene, as ozonolysis in the next step requires a double bond.

3. **Reaction 3: Ozonolysis of product 2**  
   Ozonolysis cleaves the double bond in product 2, forming carbonyl-containing fragments (product 3). The most deshielded proton in product 3 is likely adjacent to a carbonyl group, such as a CHâ group next to a carbonyl.

4. **Coupling pattern of the most deshielded proton**  
   The most deshielded proton is part of a CHâ group adjacent to a carbonyl. This CHâ group is likely coupled to two neighboring protons, leading to a triplet. However, if the CHâ group is further coupled to another set of protons, the splitting pattern becomes more complex. Based on the analysis, the coupling pattern is a triplet of triplets, as the CHâ group is adjacent to a CH group, which is itself adjacent to another CHâ group.

**Critical analysis of options:**  
- **A) Triplet**: This would occur if the CHâ group were coupled to only two equivalent protons.  
- **B) Triplet of triplets**: This occurs if the CHâ group is coupled to two protons on one side and another two protons on the other side, leading to two distinct coupling constants.  
- **C) Doublet of triplets**: This would require a different coupling scenario, such as coupling to one proton and then two protons, which is less likely here.  
- **D) Pentet**: This would occur if the CHâ group were coupled to four equivalent protons, which is not supported by the structure.

The most consistent coupling pattern, based on the structure and reaction sequence, is a triplet of triplets.  

**Answer: B**
