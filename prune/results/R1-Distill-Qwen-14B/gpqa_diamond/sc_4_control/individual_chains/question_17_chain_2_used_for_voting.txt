Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my EDTA stuff, but let's think it through.

The question says the concentration is 0.02 M of the stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Oh right, EDTA is a chelating agent, so it binds metal ions like Ca²+ tightly. The problem also gives the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, which is 5x10^10. And the pH is ideal, so I don't have to worry about the protonation of EDTA or anything like that. Wait, but what's the formula again?

I remember that the formation constant Kf is given by the concentration of the complex divided by the product of the concentrations of the individual ions. So the formula is Kf = [CaEDTA]^2- / ([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]). Wait, but wait, the stoichiometry here—EDTA typically forms a 1:1 complex with metal ions. So the formula is correct as Kf = [CaEDTA²-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]).

But wait, the problem says the solution contains 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex. So the concentration of [CaEDTA²-] is 0.02 M. So I can set up Kf = (0.02) / ([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]) = 5e10.

But wait, do I know the concentration of EDTA? Because in solution, EDTA can be in different forms. Wait, if we assume that the pH is ideal, that means the EDTA is fully deprotonated as Y^4-. So [EDTA^4-] is the same as the concentration of free EDTA in solution.

But wait, wait a second. If I start with 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex, that means that the initial concentration of EDTA is determined by that. Because each mole of CaEDTA gives one mole of EDTA when it dissociates. So, assuming that the complex is fully dissociated? No, wait, no. Because Ca-EDTA is a stable complex, so it doesn't dissociate much. So perhaps I can assume that the majority of EDTA is in the complex form.

Wait, but when considering the complex formation, the total EDTA (free EDTA + complex) would be the sum of [EDTA^4-] and [CaEDTA²-]. But the problem states that the solution contains 0.02 M Ca-EDTA. Oh, wait, maybe that's the total concentration of Ca²+ in the solution, but no, the problem says it's the concentration of the complex. So [CaEDTA²-] = 0.02 M.

So then, the Kf equation is 5e10 = 0.02 / ([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]).

But I don't know either [Ca²+] or [EDTA^4-], but I might have another equation. The total concentration of EDTA would be [EDTA^4-] + [CaEDTA²-] = [Y_total], but wait, what's the total EDTA in solution?

Wait, let's think. When we make a solution of a metal-EDTA complex, the total EDTA is the sum of free EDTA and the complex. But in this problem, the solution contains 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex. So the total EDTA (Y) is 0.02 M plus any free EDTA. But wait, if the complex is 0.02 M, and if the EDTA is in excess, then perhaps the free EDTA is present. Hmm, but without more information, maybe we can assume that the EDTA is in excess, so that [EDTA^4-] is approximately equal to the total EDTA concentration. Wait, no, because the complex formation would consume some of the EDTA.

Wait, maybe the total concentration of EDTA is equal to the concentration of the complex, because each complex has one EDTA. So [Y_total] = [CaEDTA²-] + [EDTA^4-] = 0.02 + [EDTA^4-]. But without knowing [Y_total], I'm stuck.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try a different approach. The problem asks for the concentration of calcium ions. Let's denote [Ca²+] as x. Then, what about EDTA?

Wait, in a solution where the complex is 0.02 M, and assuming that the amount of free EDTA is much less than the complex, perhaps [EDTA^4-] is approximately equal to the total EDTA minus the complex. Or wait, maybe the total EDTA is 0.02 M, since each complex has one EDTA. But wait, if I started with 0.02 M of the complex, then the EDTA in solution comes from that. So the free EDTA would be [EDTA^4-], and the complex is 0.02 M. But wait, that's only if the EDTA doesn't come from any other source. So perhaps the total EDTA is 0.02 M.

Wait, no, that can't be right. Because when you have a solution of the complex, the EDTA is part of the complex. So the total EDTA in solution would be the sum of [EDTA^4-] and [CaEDTA²-], but if you prepare the solution by dissolving 0.02 M Ca-EDTA, you would have 0.02 M of the complex. So the total EDTA would be 0.02 M (from the complex) plus any free EDTA. But if the complex is stable, most of the EDTA is tied up in the complex, so [EDTA^4-] would be very small. But again, without knowing the total EDTA, which isn't given, I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I'm meant to assume that the concentration of EDTA is in excess, such that [EDTA^4-] is approximately equal to the initial concentration of EDTA. But that's unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the solution only has the complex, and some dissociation occurs. So the total concentration of EDTA is 0.02 M, but that's not correct. Because the complex is made from Ca²+ and EDTA. So when the complex dissociates, it releases Ca²+ and EDTA.

Wait, perhaps it's best to model the situation with the Kf expression and assume that the free EDTA is negligible compared to the complex.

So Kf = [CaEDTA²-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]) = 5e10.

We have [CaEDTA²-] = 0.02 M.

Let me set [Ca²+] as x and [EDTA^4-] as y.

So 5e10 = 0.02/(x*y) → x*y = 0.02/(5e10) = 4e-13.

But I have two variables here, x and y. I need another equation. The total EDTA comes from the complex and the free EDTA.

Total EDTA = [EDTA^4-] + [CaEDTA²-] = y + 0.02 = [Y_total].

But wait, the problem doesn't give the total EDTA concentration. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the solution is prepared by dissolving 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. So the initial concentration of Ca²+ is zero, and the initial concentration of EDTA is zero, except for the complex. So when the complex dissociates a little, you get x = [Ca²+] and y = [EDTA^4-]. But without knowing the total EDTA added, how can I proceed? Maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the solution is made by adding Ca²+ and EDTA in stoichiometric amounts, and the excess is negligible, but that complicates things. Alternatively, perhaps the solution is such that the concentration of EDTA is in large excess, making [EDTA^4-] approximately constant. But without knowing that, I'm stuck.

Wait, perhaps the problem is intended to be solved by assuming that the concentration of EDTA is equal to the concentration of the complex. Because each complex has one EDTA, so [EDTA^4-] is equal to the complex's concentration? No, that can't be right because the complex is 0.02 M, and if [EDTA] is 0.02 M, then the Kf would be 0.02/(x * 0.02) = 5e10 → 1/(x) = 5e10 → x = 2e-11 M. But that's a very low concentration. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the assumption is that the amount of free EDTA is much less than the complex, so [EDTA^4-] is approximately equal to the concentration of the complex. No, that would make it 0.02 M, but then x would be 0.02/(5e10 * 0.02) → 1/(5e10) → 2e-11 M.

But wait, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, and that the total EDTA is 0.02 M, because each complex has one EDTA. But that would imply that the free EDTA is negligible, which might not be the case. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, another approach: maybe the problem is simpler. Since the complex is 0.02 M, and the formation constant is Kf, the concentration of free Ca²+ can be found from Kf = [CaEDTA]/([Ca][EDTA]). But without knowing the concentration of EDTA, I need to make some assumption.

Wait, perhaps the solution is made by dissolving the Ca-EDTA complex, which dissociates slightly into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-. So the total concentration of EDTA is 0.02 M (from the complex) plus any that dissociates. But if Kf is very large (5e10), the complex is very stable, so the dissociation is minimal. So [EDTA^4-] is approximately equal to [Ca²+], because for each unit of dissociation, one Ca²+ and one EDTA are released. So [EDTA] ≈ [Ca²+] = x.

So substituting into Kf:

5e10 = 0.02/(x * x) → 5e10 = 0.02/(x²) → x² = 0.02/(5e10) → x² = 4e-13 → x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, wait no. sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5? Let's compute it. 4e-13 = 4 * 1e-13 → square root is 2 * 1e-6.5 → 1e-6.5 is 3.16e-7, so 2 * 3.16e-7 is approximately 6.32e-7. Close to option C, which is 6.3e-7 M.

So [Ca²+] is approximately 6.3e-7 M. Which matches option C.

To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex, we use the formation constant \( K_f = 5 \times 10^{10} \). The relationship between the concentrations is given by the formula:

\[
K_f = \frac{[\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}
\]

Here, the concentration of the complex \([\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]\) is 0.02 M. Let the concentration of free calcium ions be \([\text{Ca}^{2+}] = x\), and the concentration of free EDTA \([\text{EDTA}^{4-}] = y\). Substituting into the equation:

\[
5 \times 10^{10} = \frac{0.02}{x \cdot y}
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
x \cdot y = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

To solve for \(x\), we assume that the dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex is minimal due to the very large \(K_f\). Thus, the concentration of free EDTA \([\text{EDTA}^{4-}]\) is approximately equal to the concentration of free calcium ions \([\text{Ca}^{2+}]\), i.e., \(y \approx x\). Substituting \(y = x\) into the equation:

\[
x^2 = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5}
\]

Calculating \(10^{-6.5}\) gives approximately \(3.16 \times 10^{-7}\), so:

\[
x = 2 \times 3.16 \times 10^{-7} = 6.32 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

This matches option C, which is \(6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}\).
