Okay, so I have this chemistry problem to solve. Hmm, let me read it again. The question is about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution. The solution has 200 cm³, which is 0.2 liters, right? And it contains 1.00 g of KH₂PO₄ and 1.00 g of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O. The molar masses are given as 136.09 g/mol and 177.99 g/mol respectively. The temperature is 25°C, and the Ka values for H3PO4 are provided: Ka1=7.5e-3, Ka2=6.2e-8, and Ka3=1.8e-12.

Wait, orthophosphate ions are PO₄^3- right? So I'm looking for [PO₄^3-] in the solution.

First, I think I need to figure out the concentrations of each salt in the solution. Let's start by calculating moles for each.

For KH₂PO₄: moles = mass / molar mass. So 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol. Let me compute that. 1 divided by 136.09 is approximately 0.00734 moles. So about 0.00734 mol.

Similarly, for Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O: 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol. 1 divided by 177.99 is roughly 0.00561 mol.

Now, let's think about what these salts dissociate into. 

KH₂PO₄ dissociates into K+ and H₂PO₄^-.

Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O, when dissolved, will dissociate into 2 Na+ and HPO₄^2- plus some water molecules, but the important ions are Na+ and HPO₄^2-.

Wait, so in solution, we have H₂PO₄^- and HPO₄^2- ions. But orthophosphate is PO₄^3-, which would be the deprotonated form beyond HPO₄^2-.

The phosphate species can exist in different forms depending on the pH. The solution probably involves some equilibria between H3PO4, H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, and PO4^3-.

But since we have both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- in solution, maybe I should consider the reaction between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Wait, H2PO4^- can act as an acid and donate a proton to become HPO4^2-, and HPO4^2- can donate another to become PO4^3-.

So the presence of both salts probably leads to a buffer solution, but I need to find out where the pH is such that I can calculate the concentration of PO4^3-.

Alternatively, since the solution has both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, perhaps the pH is around the pKa2, where these two species are in equilibrium.

But wait, let me think about the dissociation steps:

H3PO4 ↔ H+ + H2PO4^- (Ka1=7.5e-3)
H2PO4^- ↔ H+ + HPO4^2- (Ka2=6.2e-8)
HPO4^2- ↔ H+ + PO4^3- (Ka3=1.8e-12)

So each subsequent deprotonation is much less acidic, so the concentrations of the higher deprotonated forms are much lower.

But in this solution, I have both H2PO4^- (from KH2PO4) and HPO4^2- (from Na2HPO4). So the solution will be a buffer between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, so the pH is around pKa2.

Wait, but how much of each do I have? Let's compute the initial concentrations.

Total volume is 0.2 L.

Molarity of H2PO4^- from KH2PO4 is moles / volume. So 0.00734 mol / 0.2 L = 0.0367 M.

Molarity of HPO4^2- from Na2HPO4 is 0.00561 mol / 0.2 L = 0.02805 M.

So in solution, [H2PO4^-] = 0.0367 M, [HPO4^2-] = 0.02805 M.

Now, the question is, how much of this HPO4^2- will deprotonate into PO4^3-.

Wait, but the presence of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- suggests that the solution is a buffer around pKa2.

Wait, but wait. H2PO4^- can donate a proton to become HPO4^2-, which is the reverse of the second dissociation. So the solution is buffered between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

In that case, the pH can be found using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.

pH = pKa2 + log([A-]/[HA])

Where A- is HPO4^2- and HA is H2PO4^-.

So pKa2 is log(6.2e-8) → wait, Ka2 is 6.2e-8 → pKa2 is about 7.21 (since 1e-7 is pH7, 6.2e-8 is a little less than 7, so pKa2 is log(1/(6.2e-8)) → wait no, pKa is -log(Ka). So pKa2 = -log(6.2e-8) ≈ 7.207.

So pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-])

Plugging in the values, [HPO4^2-] is 0.02805, [H2PO4^-] is 0.0367.

So [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] = 0.02805 / 0.0367 ≈ 0.765.

Taking log of 0.765: log(0.765) is approximately -0.115.

So pH ≈ 7.207 - 0.115 ≈ 7.092.

But wait, the pH is around 7.09. Now, how does that affect the concentration of PO4^3-?

PO4^3- comes from the deprotonation of HPO4^2-: HPO4^2- ↔ H+ + PO4^3-.

The Ka for this reaction is Ka3=1.8e-12, so the equilibrium expression is Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-].

We can rearrange to solve for [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+].

We have [HPO4^2-] = 0.02805 M, but wait, that's the initial concentration. But some of it will dissociate into PO4^3-.

Wait, but in reality, the presence of H+ will affect this. Since [H+] is determined by the buffer solution's pH.

We found the pH to be approximately 7.092. So [H+] = 10^(-pH) = 10^(-7.092) ≈ 8.28e-8 M.

So [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+]

Plugging in the numbers:

Ka3 = 1.8e-12,

[HPO4^2-] = 0.02805 M,

[H+] ≈ 8.28e-8.

So:

[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02805) / 8.28e-8.

Let me compute numerator first: 1.8e-12 * 0.02805 = approx 5.049e-14.

Divide by 8.28e-8: 5.049e-14 / 8.28e-8 ≈ 6.095e-7.

Wait, let me calculate that more accurately.

Wait, 0.02805 is 2.805e-2.

So 1.8e-12 * 2.805e-2 = (1.8 * 2.805) * 1e-14.

1.8 * 2.805 ≈ 5.049.

So 5.049e-14.

Divide by 8.28e-8 → 5.049e-14 / 8.28e-8 = 5.049 / 8.28 * 1e-6.

5.049 /8.28 ≈ 0.609.

So 0.609e-6 M = 6.09e-7 M.

Looking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7, which is close. Option D is 3.97e-7. Hmm.

Wait, but wait a second, did I get the concentrations right?

Wait, the initial moles: Let me recalculate.

KH2PO4: 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol.

1 divided by 136.09 is approximately 0.00734 mol. Correct.

Na2HPO4·2H2O: 1.00 g /177.99 g/mol ≈ 0.00561 mol. Correct.

So concentrations:

In 0.2 L, that's 0.0367 M H2PO4^-, and 0.02805 M HPO4^2-.

Henderson-Hasselbalch gives pH ≈7.09.

Ka3 is 1.8e-12.

So using the equation [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+].

But wait, [HPO4^2-] is 0.02805, but is this the initial concentration before any dissociation?

Yes, because in the buffer solution, the HPO4^2- comes from the salt and remains mostly as such, with a small amount dissociating into PO4^3-.

So the calculation I did should be correct.

But let me recheck the math.

Ka3 * [HPO4^2-] = 1.8e-12 * 0.02805 = 5.049e-14.

Divide by [H+] =8.28e-8:

5.049e-14 / 8.28e-8 = 6.095e-7 M.

Wait, but the options given are:

A) 6.24e-7

B)5.48e-7

C) 2.81e-7

D)3.97e-7.

Hmm, my calculation gives approximately 6.09e-7, which is closest to option A (6.24e-7) but not exact.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the pH calculation. Let me recompute that.

pKa2 is -log(6.2e-8). Let me compute it more accurately.

log(6.2e-8) = log(6.2) + log(1e-8) = 0.7924 -8 = -7.2076.

So pKa2 =7.2076.

Then, ratio [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] =0.02805/0.0367 ≈0.765.

log(0.765) is approximately?

I know that log(0.75)= about -0.1249, and log(0.765) is a bit higher, maybe around -0.115.

So pH=7.2076 -0.115=7.0926.

Wait, maybe I should compute log(0.765) more accurately.

Log(0.765):

We can use log(7.65e-1). Let's see, 10^(-0.115)= approx 0.775, which is higher than 0.765. So perhaps log(0.765)= about -0.116. Let me use a calculator approach.

Another way: ln(0.765)= -0.267. Since ln(x) = 2.3026 * log(x), so log(x)= ln(x)/2.3026.

So log(0.765)= (-0.267)/2.3026≈-0.116.

So pH≈7.2076 -0.116=7.0916, which is about 7.09.

So [H+] =1e-7.0916 = approx 8.16e-8.

Now, recompute [PO4^3-]:

(1.8e-12 * 0.02805) / (8.16e-8).

Compute numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.02805 = approx 5.049e-14.

Denominator:8.16e-8.

So [PO4^3-] =5.049e-14 /8.16e-8 = (5.049/8.16)*1e-6.

5.049 /8.16 ≈ 0.618.

So 0.618e-6 =6.18e-7 M.

So about 6.18e-7 M. Option A is 6.24e-7, which is very close. So perhaps that's the intended answer.

But wait, maybe I should be more precise with the [H+] calculation.

Because [H+] is 1e-7.0916.

Let me compute 10^(-7.0916).

7.0916 =7 +0.0916.

10^(-7) =1e-7.

10^(-0.0916)= approx 0.876.

So 1e-7 *0.876=8.76e-8.

Wait, so [H+] is 8.76e-8.

Wait, did I get that right? Let me compute 10^(-0.0916):

Using natural logs: ln(10^x)= x ln(10), so ln(10^(-0.0916))= -0.0916 *2.3026 ≈-0.2109.

e^(-0.2109)= approx 0.810.

Wait, that's better. Because 10^(-0.0916)=e^(-0.0916 * ln(10))=e^(-0.2109)≈0.810.

So [H+] =1e-7 *0.810=8.10e-8.

So 8.10e-8.

So now, [PO4^3-]= (5.049e-14)/(8.10e-8) = (5.049 /8.10 ) * 1e-6.

5.049 /8.10≈0.623.

So 0.623e-6=6.23e-7 M.

Which is very close to option A, 6.24e-7.

So the answer should be option A.

But wait, wait a second. Let me make sure I'm not missing any other factors. For instance, is there any contribution from the autoionization of water? Probably not, as it's minimal in comparison.

Additionally, I assumed that the solution is a buffer between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, but I should confirm that HPO4^2- doesn't further deprotonate significantly. Since Ka3 is so small (1.8e-12), the PO4^3- concentration should indeed be very low, but the calculation we did shows it's about 6.2e-7, which matches option A.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the solubility of the salts or any other equilibria, but I think the approach is correct.

Wait, another thought: when I calculated the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, I considered them as the initial concentrations from the salts. But in reality, the presence of H+ may cause some of the H2PO4^- to deprotonate into HPO4^2-, and some HPO4^2- to deprotonate into PO4^3-. So the initial assumption may not hold because the buffer might have some shift.

Wait, but the buffer is mainly between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-; the concentration of PO4^3- is negligible compared to them.

Wait, perhaps the initial [HPO4^2-] and [H2PO4^-] are correct as they come from the salts, and the PO4^3- comes from the HPO4^2- via Ka3.

So, all in all, the correct answer seems to be option A, 6.24e-7 M.

To determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO₄³⁻) in the solution, we analyze the dissociation equilibria of phosphate species and calculate the contribution of PO₄³⁻ from HPO₄²⁻ deprotonation.

### Step 1: Calculate moles of each salt
- **KH₂PO₄**:  
  Moles = $\frac{1.00 \, \text{g}}{136.09 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.00734 \, \text{mol}$.  
  Concentration in solution: $\frac{0.00734 \, \text{mol}}{0.2 \, \text{L}} = 0.0367 \, \text{M}$.  
  This contributes H₂PO₄⁻ ions.

- **Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O**:  
  Moles = $\frac{1.00 \, \text{g}}{177.99 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.00561 \, \text{mol}$.  
  Concentration in solution: $\frac{0.00561 \, \text{mol}}{0.2 \, \text{L}} = 0.02805 \, \text{M}$.  
  This contributes HPO₄²⁻ ions.

### Step 2: Determine the pH of the solution
The solution is buffered between H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻, with the pH determined by the second dissociation constant of phosphoric acid ($\text{Ka}_2 = 6.2 \times 10^{-8}$). Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:  
\[
\text{pH} = \text{pKa}_2 + \log \left( \frac{[\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}{[\text{H₂PO₄⁻}]} \right)
\]
- $\text{pKa}_2 = -\log(6.2 \times 10^{-8}) \approx 7.207$.  
- Ratio: $\frac{[\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}{[\text{H₂PO₄⁻}]} = \frac{0.02805}{0.0367} \approx 0.765$.  
- $\log(0.765) \approx -0.116$.  

Thus,  
\[
\text{pH} = 7.207 - 0.116 = 7.091.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate [PO₄³⁻] from HPO₄²⁻ deprotonation
The third dissociation of phosphoric acid governs the formation of PO₄³⁻:  
\[
\text{Ka}_3 = \frac{[\text{H}^+][\text{PO₄³⁻}]}{[\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}
\]
Rearranging for $[\text{PO₄³⁻}]$:  
\[
[\text{PO₄³⁻}] = \frac{\text{Ka}_3 \cdot [\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}{[\text{H}^+]}
\]
- $\text{Ka}_3 = 1.8 \times 10^{-12}$.  
- $[\text{HPO₄²⁻}] = 0.02805 \, \text{M}$.  
- $[\text{H}^+] = 10^{-\text{pH}} = 10^{-7.091} \approx 8.10 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{M}$.  

Substitute values:  
\[
[\text{PO₄³⁻}] = \frac{(1.8 \times 10^{-12})(0.02805)}{8.10 \times 10^{-8}} = \frac{5.049 \times 10^{-14}}{8.10 \times 10^{-8}} \approx 6.23 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}.
\]

### Step 4: Match with the closest option
The calculated concentration of PO₄³⁻ is approximately $6.23 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}$, which matches **Option A** ($6.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}$).

**Answer: A**
