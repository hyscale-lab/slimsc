Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric fields and conductors. Hmm, let me think. Let's read it again.

The setup is an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R. There's a small cavity inside, radius r, and the center of the cavity is a distance s from the conductor's center. So the cavity isn't at the center of the conductor. Then, a small positive charge +q is placed inside this cavity. I need to find the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. 

Point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor, and its distance from the cavity's center is l. Also, l and L are both bigger than R, so P is definitely outside the conductor. The angle between l and s is theta. 

Wait, the options are given, so maybe I can figure this out by recalling some concepts. I remember that conductors have some interesting properties regarding electric fields and charges.

So, when a conductor is neutral, and you place a charge inside a cavity, the conductor responds. Oh right, the charges in the conductor rearrange themselves. But wait, the conductor was initially uncharged, right? So when we put +q inside the cavity, the conductor will have induced charges. 

I think the conductor will develop a charge on its inner surface and outer surface. Because the conductor is neutral, the total induced charges should balance. Let me recall: the inner surface of the conductor must have an induced charge of -q, because the charge inside the cavity attracts opposite charges. Then, the outer surface must have a charge of +q to balance, since the conductor was neutral.

Wait, but wait. The cavity's center is not at the center of the conductor. So the induced charges might not be symmetric. Hmm. But the point P is outside the conductor, which is a sphere of radius R. So when considering the electric field outside a conductor, I think we can consider the conductor as a point charge located at its center.

Oh right, Gauss's Law! The electric field outside a conductor depends only on the total charge enclosed. Since the conductor is neutral to start with, the total charge on the outer surface is +q, and the inner surface is -q. Wait, no. Wait, the conductor was uncharged. So the inner surface would have -q, and the outer surface would have +q, so the conductor's total charge is zero. No, wait. The total charge of the conductor is the sum of inner and outer. Since the conductor was neutral, the inner surface has -q, and the outer has +q. So the total is zero. Wait no, that can't be right. Because the conductor is neutral, any induced charges must sum to zero. So the inner surface has -q, and the outer must have +q, so the conductor's net charge is zero. Or wait, maybe the outer surface has zero. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, no. The conductor is neutral, so the total charge on the conductor must be zero. The charge +q is inside the cavity. So the inner surface will have an induced charge of -q, which is opposite to the charge inside, to cancel the field inside the conductor. Then, the outer surface must have +q to balance the inner surface, but wait, the conductor's total charge is zero, so I'm getting mixed up.

Wait, no. The conductor was initially neutral. So when you put a charge +q in the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor must have a charge of -q (to cancel the field inside the conductor material). Then, the outer surface must have a charge of +q, because the conductor's total charge is the sum of inner and outer. So conductor's total charge would be (-q) + (+q) = 0, so that's consistent.

But when you're outside the conductor, the field is as if all the charge is at the center. So the field outside is due to the total charge on the conductor, which in this case is zero? Wait, no. Wait, the conductor's outer surface has a charge of +q, right? Because the inner surface has -q, and the conductor was neutral. So the outer surface must have +q. So the total charge of the conductor's outer surface is +q. So outside the conductor, the electric field would be the same as if all that charge were concentrated at the center of the sphere.

So at point P, which is outside the conductor, the electric field E is due to the +q charge on the outer surface. So applying Coulomb's law, E = (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L², where L is the distance from the center of the conductor to P. Because the outer surface's charge is q, the field outside depends only on that.

Wait, but looking at the options, option B is exactly that: (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L². So that would be the answer.

But wait, let me make sure. The point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor. The conductor's radius is R, so since L > R, we're outside. So the field is as if the charge is at the center. So the direction would depend on the position, but the magnitude would be q/(4πε₀ L²).

But let me think again—could the position of the cavity affect this? Because the charge +q is not at the center. The cavity is offset by s distance. So the initial placement of the charge might influence the distribution of induced charges. But wait, the conductor is a conductor, so the electric field inside it must be zero. So the induced charges would create a field that cancels any internal fields. 

But for points outside the conductor, the field depends only on the total charge on the conductor. So the inner arrangement (like where the charge is in the cavity) doesn't affect the external field. So the external field is as if all the charge is at the center.

So for point P, the electric field is as if the charge is at the center of the conductor. So E = (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L². That matches option B. So the answer should be B.

To determine the electric field $\vec{E}$ at a point $P$ outside the spherical conductor, we analyze the setup as follows:

1. **Conductor Properties**: The spherical conductor is initially uncharged. When a small positive charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity, the conductor responds by inducing charges on its inner and outer surfaces. The inner surface of the conductor develops an induced charge of $-q$ to cancel the electric field within the conductor material. The outer surface, being part of a neutral conductor, develops a charge of $+q$ to balance the inner surface charge.

2. **Electric Field Outside the Conductor**: For points outside the conductor (where $L > R$), the electric field depends only on the total charge enclosed within the conductor. Since the conductor's outer surface has a total charge of $+q$, the electric field at point $P$ is as if the charge $+q$ is concentrated at the center of the conductor.

3. **Magnitude of the Electric Field**: Using Coulomb's law, the magnitude of the electric field at point $P$ is given by:
   \[
   E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}
   \]
   where $L$ is the distance from the center of the conductor to point $P$.

4. **Irrelevance of Cavity Position**: The position of the cavity (offset by $s$ and angle $\theta$) does not affect the external electric field. This is because the external field depends only on the total charge on the conductor's outer surface, which is $+q$, and is distributed as if it were at the center of the conductor.

5. **Correct Option**: Among the given options, the correct expression for the electric field at point $P$ is:
   \[
   E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}
   \]
   which corresponds to **Option B**.
