Okay, so I'm faced with a quantum field theory problem here. The question is about finding the mass dimension of a coupling constant κ in a given Lagrangian and determining whether the theory is renormalizable. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's break it down step by step.

Alright, the Lagrangian given is L_int = κψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}, where σ_{μν} is (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]. I remember that in QFT, the mass dimension of the coupling constant is important for renormalizability. The general idea is that a theory is renormalizable if all the coupling constants have non-negative mass dimensions. If any coupling has a negative mass dimension, the theory is not renormalizable because it would require an infinite number of counterterms.

So, first, I need to find the mass dimension of κ. To do that, I should figure out the mass dimensions of each field and factor in the Lagrangian's overall dimension.

Wait, what's the mass dimension of each term in the Lagrangian? The Lagrangian has to have mass dimension 4 because when you integrate it over spacetime (which has dimension 4), you get an action which is dimensionless. So each term in the Lagrangian must be dimension 4.

Let me list the fields involved here. We have ψ, which is a spinor field. The gamma matrices γ are dimensionless because they're just matrices, right? The field F^{μν} is the field strength tensor, which for electromagnetism is ∂μ Aν - ∂ν Aμ. The Aμ field has mass dimension 1 because the gauge field term in the Lagrangian is (1/4) F^2, and each F is ∂A, so each ∂ contributes mass dimension 1. Wait, let me think. The derivative ∂ has dimension 1. So F^{μν} is ∂μ Aν - ∂ν Aμ, so each term is (∂A) which has dimension [∂][A]. The photon field A has dimension 1 because the kinetic term is (∂A)^2, and ∂A must have dimension 2 (since squared is 4, matching the Lagrangian's dimension 4). So [A] = 1 because [∂A] = 1 + [A], but wait wait. No, wait, the term (∂μ Aν)^2 would have dimension (1 + 1)^2 = 4? No, no, each ∂ is dimension 1, and A is dimension 1, so ∂A has dimension 2. Squared would be 4. So each F has dimension 2. So F^{μν} has mass dimension 2.

Now, the term σ_{μν} is (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]. The gamma matrices are dimensionless, right? Because they're just part of the spinor representation, so their commutator is also dimensionless. So σ_{μν} has mass dimension 0.

So putting it all together, the term in the Lagrangian is κ * ψ̄ * σ_{μν} * ψ * F^{μν}.

Each field's mass dimension: ψ is a Dirac spinor, which has mass dimension 3/2. Because in four dimensions, the Dirac field ψ has [ψ] = 3/2. So ψ̄, being the adjoint, also has [ψ̄] = 3/2.

So let's compute the mass dimension of each part:

κ has dimension [κ].

ψ̄ has [3/2].

σ_{μν} has [0].

ψ has [3/2].

F^{μν} has [2].

Multiply them all together, and the product should have [4], because the Lagrangian's term must be dimension 4.

So the total dimension is:

[κ] + [ψ̄] + [σ] + [ψ] + [F] = 4.

Plugging the numbers:

[κ] + (3/2) + 0 + (3/2) + 2 = 4.

Adding the terms without [κ]: (3/2 + 3/2) is 3, plus 2 is 5. So 5 + [κ] =4.

Wait, that can't be right, because 5 + [κ] equals 4? So [κ] would be -1. Because 5 + (-1) =4.

So [κ]_M = -1. That's the mass dimension of κ. So looking at the options, options A and C have this. So the first part of the answer is either A or C.

Now, the second part is whether the theory is renormalizable. Remember, a theory is renormalizable if all the coupling constants have non-negative mass dimensions. Because the coupling with negative mass dimension would imply that the interaction term has higher than dimension 4, making it non-renormalizable (since higher-dimensional operators require infinite terms upon renormalization).

In our case, [κ] is -1, which is negative. So the coupling has negative mass dimension. Therefore, the interaction term is not renormalizable. So the theory is not renormalizable.

So combining the two parts: [κ]_M =-1 and the theory is not renormalizable. Which is option C.

Wait, let me cross-check. Another approach: The interaction term is of the form ψ̄ σ F ψ.

In terms of dimension counting, each ψ is 3/2, so ψ̄ ψ is 3. F is 2, so total dimension before κ is 3 + 2 =5. Since the Lagrangian requires dimension 4, κ must compensate by being dimension -1.

So yes, the κ's dimension is -1, and negative dimension implies the interaction is non-renormalizable. So the correct answer is option C.

To determine the mass dimension of the coupling constant \(\kappa\) and whether the theory is renormalizable, we analyze the given Lagrangian:

\[
\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}} = \kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu},
\]
where \(\sigma_{\mu\nu} = \frac{i}{2}[\gamma_\mu, \gamma_\nu]\). The mass dimension of the Lagrangian must be 4, as it is integrated over spacetime (dimension 4) to yield a dimensionless action.

### Step 1: Mass dimensions of the fields
- The Dirac spinor \(\psi\) has mass dimension \([ \psi ] = \frac{3}{2}\), and its adjoint \(\bar{\psi}\) also has \([ \bar{\psi} ] = \frac{3}{2}\).
- The field strength tensor \(F^{\mu\nu}\) is derived from the gauge field \(A_\mu\), which has mass dimension \([A_\mu] = 1\). Since \(F^{\mu\nu} = \partial^\mu A^\nu - \partial^\nu A^\mu\), it has mass dimension \([F^{\mu\nu}] = 2\).
- The commutator \(\sigma_{\mu\nu}\) involves \(\gamma\)-matrices, which are dimensionless. Thus, \([ \sigma_{\mu\nu} ] = 0\).

### Step 2: Mass dimension of \(\kappa\)
The interaction term in the Lagrangian is \(\kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu}\). The total mass dimension of this term must equal 4. Assigning the dimensions of each factor:
\[
[ \kappa ] + [ \bar{\psi} ] + [ \sigma_{\mu\nu} ] + [ \psi ] + [ F^{\mu\nu} ] = 4.
\]
Substituting the known dimensions:
\[
[ \kappa ] + \frac{3}{2} + 0 + \frac{3}{2} + 2 = 4.
\]
Simplifying:
\[
[ \kappa ] + 5 = 4 \implies [ \kappa ] = -1.
\]

### Step 3: Renormalizability of the theory
A theory is renormalizable if all coupling constants have non-negative mass dimensions. Since \([ \kappa ] = -1\), which is negative, the interaction term has a dimension higher than 4. This implies the theory is not renormalizable.

### Final Answer
The mass dimension of \(\kappa\) is \(-1\), and the theory is not renormalizable.
