Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when several solutions are mixed. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, the problem says we're mixing HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2. Let me write down the concentrations and volumes first.

HCl is 500 mL of 0.2 M. H2SO4 is 300 mL of 0.3 M, and Ba(OH)2 is 200 mL of 0.5 M. I guess the first step is to find out how many moles of each acid and base we have.

Wait, but wait, when you mix acids and bases, it's about neutralization reactions. So I should figure out the total moles of H+ from the acids and the total moles of OH- from the base. Then, the neutralization will involve H+ and OH- combining to form water.

Let me break it down. For HCl, since it's a strong acid, it dissociates completely. Each mole of HCl gives one mole of H+. So moles of HCl = Molarity * Volume (in liters). So HCl: 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 moles. That gives 0.1 moles of H+.

H2SO4 is a strong acid too, so it dissociates into 2 H+ and one SO4^2- per molecule. So each mole of H2SO4 contributes 2 moles of H+. The moles of H2SO4 is 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 moles. So H+ from H2SO4 is 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. It dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2 OH^- per formula unit. So each mole gives 2 moles of OH-. Moles of Ba(OH)2 is 0.5 M * 0.2 L = 0.1 moles. So OH- is 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 moles.

Now, the total H+ is 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 moles. OH- is 0.2 moles. So when they mix, the H+ and OH- will neutralize each other. The reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O. 

But wait, which is in excess? Let's see: H+ is 0.28, OH- is 0.2. So OH- is the limiting reactant. It will neutralize 0.2 moles of H+. That leaves 0.28 - 0.2 = 0.08 moles of H+ unreacted. But wait, wait, no. Because if I have more H+ than OH-, all OH- will be neutralized, and the excess H+ will remain, making the solution acidic. But in terms of neutralization, only the OH- reacts. So the total moles of H+ that are neutralized are 0.2. 

Wait, but wait: HCl and H2SO4 are both acids, so their H+ will combine with the OH- from the base. So the total H+ is 0.28, OH- is 0.2. So the neutralization will consume all the OH- and 0.2 H+.

So the amount of H2O formed is 0.2 moles. But wait, I'm not sure if that's the right way to think about it. Alternatively, maybe I should calculate the total H+ and OH- and find the net.

Alternatively, maybe the neutralization reaction can be thought of as the sum of H+ from all acids and OH- from all bases, and the excess determines the pH, but for the enthalpy, perhaps we just calculate the total moles of H+ and OH- that are neutralized, which is the minimum of H+ and OH-.

Wait, but enthalpy of neutralization is usually per mole of H+ or OH- reacting. So each mole of H+ reacting releases a certain amount of energy, typically around 57 kJ per mole for strong acids and bases. But wait, the standard enthalpy of neutralization for strong acids and strong bases is about -57 kJ/mol. Because H+ and OH- combine to form water, which is exothermic.

So the process is: H+ (aq) + OH- (aq) → H2O(l), ΔH = -57 kJ/mol.

So the total enthalpy change would be the moles of H+ reacting multiplied by -57 kJ/mol. Or alternatively, moles of OH- reacting multiplied by the same.

In this case, moles of OH- is 0.2, so the enthalpy change would be 0.2 * (-57) = -11.4 kJ. Wait, but looking at the options, I see option B is -11.42 kcal, and option D is -16.0 kJ. Oh wait, the units here differ. Wait, the question says "calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when... are mixed." So the answer should be in either kJ or kcal.

Wait, let me double-check the units. The standard enthalpy is typically given in kJ. So 0.2 mol times 57 kJ/mol would be 11.4 kJ. But the question's options include B as kcal and D as kJ.

Wait, wait, but I'm a bit confused about the exact value. Another thought: Sometimes, the enthalpy of neutralization is given as approximately 57 kJ per mole of H+ (or OH-) reacting. So let's compute.

Wait, wait, the problem is about mixing these solutions. So the total H+ is 0.28, OH- is 0.2. The neutralization will happen between these, so 0.2 moles of H+ will react with 0.2 moles of OH-, producing 0.2 moles of water. So the enthalpy change is 0.2 * (-57,000 cal) → because 57 kJ is 57,000 J, but wait, sometimes the value is given in calories. Wait, I'm a bit confused about the unit conversion.

Wait, 1 calorie is 4.184 joules. 1 kilocalorie (kcal) is 1000 calories. So 57 kJ is approximately 13.65 kcal. Because 57,000 J divided by 4,184 J/kcal is approximately 13.6 kcal.

Wait, 57,000 / 4184 ≈ 13.6 So, each mole of H+ neutralized releases about 13.6 kcal.

Wait, but the options are in kcal and kJ. Let me get back to the calculations.

Total moles of H+ from HCl: 0.2 * 0.5 L = 0.1 mol.

H2SO4: 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 mol H2SO4 → 0.18 mol H+.

Total H+ = 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 mol.

Ba(OH)2: 0.5 M * 0.2 L = 0.1 mol Ba(OH)2 → 0.2 mol OH-.

So, neutralization reaction: H+ + OH- → H2O. 

Moles of H+ reacting: 0.2 mol (since OH- is limiting). 

So, enthalpy change is 0.2 mol * (-57,000 J/mol) = -11,400 J = -11.4 kJ. 

Wait, but 57,000 J is 57 kJ. So 0.2 * 57 = 11.4 → so the change is -11.4 kJ. Looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ, which is higher. Hmm, that's not matching.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check the H+ again.

HCl: 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 mol H+.

H2SO4: 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 mol H2SO4 → 0.18 mol H+.

Yes, that's correct.

Ba(OH)2: 0.5 M * 0.2 L = 0.1 mol Ba(OH)2 → 0.2 mol OH-.

So the neutralization is 0.2 mol of H+ reacting with 0.2 mol OH-.

So the enthalpy change is 0.2 * (-57,000 J) = -11,400 J → which is -11.4 kJ.

But wait, looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ, which is more than this. Option B is -11.42 kcal. Hmm, perhaps the question is using kcal as the unit. Let me check the unit in standard enthalpy.

Wait, the standard enthalpy of neutralization is about 57 kJ/mol (H+), which is about 13.6 kcal/mol. Because 57,000 J is 57 kJ, and 57,000 J / 4,184 J/kcal ≈ 13.6 kcal.

So for 0.2 mol, the enthalpy would be 0.2 * (-13.6 kcal/mol) = -2.72 kcal. Wait, but that's option A.

Wait, I'm getting confused because I'm not sure whether the 57 kJ is per mole of H+ or per mole of reaction (since each mole of H+ is one mole of reaction). So 0.2 mol H+ would be 0.2 * 57 kJ = 11.4 kJ. But if the unit is kcal, then it's 0.2 * 13.6 kcal ≈ 2.72 kcal, so negative → -2.72 kcal, which is option A.

But wait, why are the options varying between kJ and kcal?

The problem says 'en calory', perhaps. Let me read the question again.

The question is to calculate the enthalpy of neutralization. So the standard units for enthalpy are typically kJ. However, sometimes it's given in kcal, especially in biological contexts. So, perhaps I need to figure out whether the calculation should be in kJ or kcal.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the total amount of acid and base and see if I can think of it in another way.

Wait, another approach: The reaction between the acids and the base.

Wait, but H2SO4 is a diprotic acid. So when it reacts with a base, each H+ can react. But in this case, since it's mixing with a strong base, all the H+ will be neutralized, but depending on the stoichiometry.

Wait, but in this scenario, the total H+ is 0.28 mol, and OH- is 0.2 mol. So all the OH- will be neutralized, and 0.08 mol H+ will remain. So the neutralization is 0.2 mol H+ reacting with 0.2 mol OH-.

So the enthalpy change is 0.2 mol × (−57 kJ/mol) = −11.4 kJ. But none of the options have exactly -11.4 kJ except option B is -11.42 kcal, which is in different units.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me compute 57 kJ in kcal. 57,000 J equals 57,000 / 4184 ≈ 13.6 kcal. So per mole of H+, the enthalpy is -13.6 kcal. So 0.2 mol would be 0.2 * (-13.6) = -2.72 kcal, which is option A.

But why is the option B -11.42 kcal? That would imply 0.28 mol reacting. But that's not the case because OH- is only 0.2 mol.

Wait, maybe I should think about the total possible neutralization. Wait, another possibility: perhaps the neutralization is calculated per mole of each solution.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering only the reaction between H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2, but that's not correct because HCl is also an acid.

Wait, perhaps I should write down all the possible reactions.

HCl + Ba(OH)2 → ?

HCl is a strong acid, Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. The reaction would be HCl + Ba(OH)2 → BaCl2 + H2O.

But considering stoichiometry, each mole of Ba(OH)2 reacts with two moles of HCl. Because Ba(OH)2 has two OH- ions.

Wait, but in this case, the total moles of HCl are 0.1 mol, and Ba(OH)2 is 0.1 mol. So 0.1 mol Ba(OH)2 would need 0.2 mol HCl for complete neutralization.

But we have only 0.1 mol HCl available. So HCl is the limiting reactant here.

Wait, but HCl would provide 0.1 mol H+, Ba(OH)2 provides 0.2 mol OH-. So HCl can neutralize 0.1 mol OH-, leaving 0.1 mol OH-.

Then, the H2SO4 would react with the remaining OH-. H2SO4 is 0.09 mol, which provides 0.18 mol H+. The remaining OH- is 0.1 mol. So 0.1 mol H+ can react with 0.1 mol OH-, leaving 0.08 mol H+.

Wait, but perhaps I should account for all reactions step by step.

1. HCl (0.1 mol H+) reacts with Ba(OH)2 (0.2 mol OH-). HCl is limiting. So 0.1 mol H+ reacts with 0.1 mol OH-, producing 0.1 mol H2O. Enthalpy change: 0.1 * (-57 kJ) = -5.7 kJ.

2. Remaining OH- from Ba(OH)2 is 0.2 - 0.1 = 0.1 mol.

3. H2SO4 (0.09 mol H2SO4 → 0.18 mol H+) reacts with remaining OH- (0.1 mol). So all 0.1 mol OH- reacts with 0.1 mol H+ from H2SO4, producing 0.1 mol H2O. Enthalpy change: 0.1 * (-57 kJ) = -5.7 kJ.

Total enthalpy change: -5.7 -5.7 = -11.4 kJ. So that's -11.4 kJ, which is approximately -11.4 kJ. So looking at the options, option B is -11.42 kcal, which is close but in different units. Option D is -16.0 kJ, which is higher.

Wait, but earlier I thought the entire 0.2 mol H+ reacts, but that approach might not account for which acid reacts first.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial approach was correct, and the enthalpy change is -11.4 kJ, but the options don't have that. Looking back:

Options:

A) -2.72 kcal

B) -11.42 kcal

C) -3.80 kcal

D) -16.0 kJ

So if the problem expects the answer in kJ, the closest is D (16.0 vs 11.4 doesn't match). But if it's in kcal, B is about -11.42 kcal. Wait, but 11.4 kJ is about 2.72 kcal? No, wait:

Wait, 1 kJ is approximately 0.239 kcal. So 11.4 kJ ≈ 11.4 * 0.239 ≈ 2.72 kcal. So -11.4 kJ is equivalent to about -2.72 kcal. But option A is -2.72 kcal, which would match this.

But earlier, when I did the step-by-step reaction, the total enthalpy change was -11.4 kJ. So why is the calculation conflicting?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the unit conversion. Let me double-check.

1 kcal = 4184 J.

So 57 kJ is 57,000 J. To convert to kcal, divide by 4184: 57000 / 4184 ≈ 13.6 kcal.

So 57 kJ is about 13.6 kcal.

So each mole of H+ gives off 13.6 kcal.

If 0.2 mol H+ reacts, then 0.2 * 13.6 ≈ 2.72 kcal. So the change is -2.72 kcal, which is option A.

But earlier, when I thought of the reaction as a sum of two steps, each contributing -5.7 kJ, which sums to -11.4 kJ, which is 2.72 kcal.

Wait, so both methods lead to the same conclusion but in different units. So if the question expects the answer in kJ, the answer would be -11.4 kJ, which is not among the options. The options have D as -16.0 kJ, which is way off.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm confusing the number of moles. Let me recount.

HCl: 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 mol HCl → 0.1 mol H+.

H2SO4: 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 mol H2SO4 → 0.18 mol H+.

Ba(OH)2: 0.5 M * 0.2 L = 0.1 mol → 0.2 mol OH-.

So total H+ = 0.28 mol.

OH- = 0.2 mol.

So the reaction is 0.2 mol H+ + 0.2 mol OH- → 0.2 mol H2O.

Enthalpy change: 0.2 * (-57 kJ/mol) = -11.4 kJ. So in kJ, the answer is -11.4 kJ, which is not an option. The options are: A is -2.72 kcal, B is -11.42 kcal, and D is -16.0 kJ.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the stoichiometry. Let me think about the possibility of Ba(OH)2 reacting with H2SO4.

Wait, Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. H2SO4 is a strong acid. Their reaction would be:

Ba(OH)2 + H2SO4 → BaSO4 ↓ + 2 H2O.

The balanced equation is: Ba(OH)2 + H2SO4 → BaSO4 + 2 H2O.

So the mole ratio is 1:1.

Moles of Ba(OH)2: 0.1 mol.

Moles of H2SO4: 0.09 mol.

H2SO4 is in lesser amount, so all 0.09 mol would react, producing 0.09 mol BaSO4 and 0.18 mol H2O. But wait, from the balanced equation, each mole of H2SO4 produces 2 moles of H2O. So 0.09 mol H2SO4 → 0.18 mol H2O.

Wait, but the enthalpy of neutralization is the energy change per mole of H+ or OH- reacting. So for this reaction, each mole of H2SO4 contributes 2 moles of H+ (since it's diprotic), and each mole of Ba(OH)2 contributes 2 moles of OH-.

So when they react, each mole of H2SO4 would neutralize 2 moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2.

So let's compute:

H2SO4: 0.09 mol → 0.18 mol H+.

Ba(OH)2: 0.1 mol → 0.2 mol OH-.

So the neutralization between H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 would be:

H+ from H2SO4: 0.18 mol.

OH-: 0.2 mol.

So all 0.18 mol H+ would react with 0.18 mol OH-, leaving 0.02 mol OH-.

Now, the remaining OH- is 0.02 mol, which can react with HCl.

HCl: 0.1 mol H+.

So H+ from HCl: 0.1 mol.

OH- remaining: 0.02 mol.

So 0.02 mol OH- reacts with 0.02 mol H+ from HCl, leaving 0.08 mol H+ unreacted.

So total moles of H+ neutralized: 0.18 (from H2SO4) + 0.02 (from HCl) = 0.20 mol.

So each mole of H+ neutralized releases about 57 kJ. So 0.20 mol → 0.2 * 57 = 11.4 kJ. So the total enthalpy change is -11.4 kJ.

But the options have B as -11.42 kcal, which is roughly the same value in different units. Because 11.4 kJ is approximately 2.72 kcal (since 57 kJ is about 13.6 kcal, so 0.2 *13.6=2.72). Wait, no, wait: 57 kJ is 13.6 kcal. So 11.4 kJ is (11.4 / 57) * 13.6 kcal. Let me compute:

11.4 kJ is (11.4 /57 ) × 13.6 = 2.72 kcal.

Wait, but that would mean the enthalpy change is -2.72 kcal, which is option A.

But earlier, when considering all the neutralizations, the total H+ neutralized is 0.20 mol. So 0.20 mol × 57 kJ/mol = 11.4 kJ → which is -11.4 kJ.

But I'm getting conflicting results in units. Let's think again.

If the standard enthalpy of neutralization is 57 kJ per mole of H+:

0.2 mol → 0.2 *57=11.4 kJ.

If converted to kcal: 11.4 kJ × (1 kcal / 4.184 kJ) ≈ 2.72 kcal.

But option B is -11.42 kcal, which is about 11.42 kcal. That would correspond to 11.42 * 4.184 ≈ 47.6 kJ. Which is not matching our 11.4 kJ.

So I'm confused.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach. Let me think about the total moles of H+ and OH-.

Total H+ = 0.1 (HCl) + 0.18 (H2SO4) = 0.28.

Total OH- = 0.2.

So the neutralization is the minimum of H+ and OH-: 0.2.

So the moles of reaction is 0.2 mol.

So the enthalpy is 0.2 × (-57 kJ) = -11.4 kJ.

But if the question expects the answer in kJ, then the correct option would be -11.4 kJ. However, the options don't have that. The closest is option D: -16.0 kJ, which is off.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the calculation in terms of the total reaction, considering the balanced equation. Let's think about the overall reaction.

The overall reaction is:

H+ (from HCl and H2SO4) + OH- (from Ba(OH)2) → H2O.

Total H+ = 0.28 mol.

Total OH- = 0.2 mol.

So the reaction consumes 0.2 H+ and 0.2 OH-.

So the moles of H2O formed: 0.2.

The enthalpy change is 0.2 × (-57,000 J) = -11,400 J = -11.4 kJ.

So that's the calculation.

Looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ, which is not matching. Option B is -11.42 kcal, which is about the same as 11.4 kJ converted to kcal.

Wait, 11.4 kJ is 11,400 J. Converting to kcal: 11400 /4184 ≈ 2.72 kcal.

But option B is -11.42 kcal. That's about 47.6 kJ (11.42 kcal ×4184 ≈ 47.6 kJ), which is much larger than our calculation.

So the options have a mix of kJ and kcal. Let me read the question again: the options are a mix of kcal and kJ. That's a bit confusing.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the exact value.

57 kJ is 57,000 J.

1 cal = 4.184 J. So 57,000 J is 57,000 / 4.184 ≈ 13,600 calories → 13.6 kcal.

So for 0.2 mol:

0.2 * 13.6 kcal = 2.72 kcal.

So the enthalpy change is -2.72 kcal, which is option A.

But earlier, when I considered the neutralization step by step, I found that 0.2 mol H+ is neutralized, so the change is -2.72 kcal. But when I did the initial approach, I thought that the change is -11.4 kJ, which is the same as 2.72 kcal.

So the correct answer should be option A: -2.72 kcal.

Wait, but why is option B -11.42 kcal? That's about -47.6 kJ, which would be 0.86 mol neutralized.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think again.

Total H+ is 0.28 mol, OH- is 0.2.

So the neutralization is 0.2 mol H+ × (-57,000 J) = -11,400 J → -11.4 kJ.

But if the problem expects the answer in kcal, then that's -2.72 kcal. So option A.

But where does -11.42 kcal come from? That would be 0.28 mol × 40.8 kJ/mol. Because 0.28 × 40.8 ≈ 11.424.

Wait, 0.28 × 40.8 → 11.424. So if the enthalpy per H+ is 40.8 kcal, but that's not the standard value. The standard is about 13.6 kcal per H+.

So perhaps the question is using a different enthalpy value. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the neutralization of each acid separately, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, another approach: calculate the total heat released from each neutralization.

For HCl and Ba(OH)2:

HCl: 0.1 mol H+.

Ba(OH)2: 0.2 mol OH-.

So, HCl is the limiting reagent, providing 0.1 mol H+. Neutralization: 0.1 mol H+ × 57 kJ → 5.7 kJ.

For H2SO4 and remaining OH-:

After HCl, 0.1 mol OH- is left (0.2 -0.1 =0.1).

H2SO4 provides 0.18 mol H+. So 0.1 mol OH- neutralizes 0.1 mol H+ from H2SO4. So enthalpy change: 0.1 ×57 kJ =5.7 kJ.

Total: 5.7 +5.7 =11.4 kJ. Which is -11.4 kJ.

So in kJ, the answer is -11.4 kJ, but in the options, the closest is D) -16.0 kJ, which is not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that H2SO4 is diprotic, so each mole contributes 2 H+, so the neutralization would be 0.18 × 2 =0.36 H+? No, that's not correct. H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, but in solution, it fully dissociates into 2 H+ and SO4^2-.

So H2SO4 contributes 0.18 mol H+.

So I'm confident that the correct enthalpy change is -11.4 kJ, which is option D if it were -11.4 kJ. But option D is -16.0 kJ.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that each mole of Ba(OH)2 contributes 2 OH-, so when it neutralizes, each mole of Ba(OH)2 would require 2 moles of H+.

Wait, but HCl is a monoprotic acid, H2SO4 is diprotic.

Alternatively, perhaps the neutralization with Ba(OH)2 is more exothermic.

Wait, maybe the problem uses a different value for the enthalpy of neutralization. Some sources say that the enthalpy is about 57 kJ per mole of H+.

So 0.2 mol H+ → 0.2 ×57 =11.4 kJ.

So the calculation is correct.

But the options don't have this in kJ, except D is -16.0 kJ, which is higher.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the problem is mixing all the solutions, but considering that the total volume is 500 + 300 + 200 =1000 mL → 1 L.

But the concentrations are already accounted for in moles, so the dilution doesn't affect the moles, just the final temperature change if needed. But for enthalpy calculation, it's just the moles reacting.

So I'm back to square one. Based on that, the correct answer is -11.4 kJ, which isn't an option. Alternatively, in kcal, it's -2.72 kcal, which is option A.

But why is option B -11.42 kcal? That would be 0.28 mol ×40.8 kJ/mol → so perhaps the enthalpy per H+ is taken as 40.8 kJ → which is 40.8 /4.184 ≈9.75 kcal.

Wait, 40.8 kJ is approximately 9.75 kcal per mole H+.

Wait, that can't be right because the standard is about 57 kJ (13.6 kcal) per H+.

So perhaps the user made a mistake in the options. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the total acid and base concentrations first.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the equivalents.

HCl: 0.1 mol H+ → 0.1 eq.

H2SO4: 0.09 mol × 2 =0.18 eq.

Ba(OH)2: 0.1 mol ×2=0.2 eq.

So total acid equivalents: 0.1 +0.18 =0.28.

Total base equivalents:0.2.

So the neutralization is up to 0.2 eq.

So, 0.2 eq ×57 kJ →-11.4 kJ.

So the correct answer is -11.4 kJ, but the options don't have that. So perhaps the intended answer is option B, but that's in kcal and would require a different enthalpy value.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the answer in kJ but with a different enthalpy value.

Wait, perhaps the question is using the molar enthalpy as -57,000 cal/mol. Because 57,000 cal is 57 kcal.

Wait, 57 kcal per mole H+.

So for 0.2 mol →0.2 ×57=11.4 kcal.

So the change is -11.4 kcal, which is option B as -11.42 kcal.

Ah, that makes sense. I think I was confused earlier between kJ and kcal in the standard enthalpy value.

So if the standard enthalpy is taken as 57 kcal per mole (which is 57,000 cal), then 0.2 mol would be 0.2 ×57=11.4 kcal. Thus, the answer is -11.42 kcal (option B).

But wait, earlier I thought 57 kJ is about 13.6 kcal, so that would be different. So why is this discrepancy?

Ah, because I might have mixed up the units. Let me clarify:

- 1 cal = 4.184 J.

- 1 kJ = 1000 J.

- So, 1 kJ = 1000 /4.184 ≈239.006 cal →≈0.239 kcal.

So, 57 kJ is 57,000 J. To convert to kcal: 57,000 /4184 ≈13.6 kcal.

But if someone mistakenly uses 57 kcal per mole (which is 57,000 cal), then 0.2 mol ×57 kcal/mol =11.4 kcal → option B.

So perhaps the problem is using 57 kcal/mol as the enthalpy of neutralization. Hence, the answer would be -11.42 kcal, option B.

But I'm a bit confused because the standard value is about 57 kJ, not 57 kcal.

Wait, let me double-check some references. The standard enthalpy of neutralization for strong acids and strong bases is indeed about -57 kJ/mol. So, each mole of H+ gives off 57 kJ.

So, the correct approach would be using 57 kJ and thus the correct answer would be -11.4 kJ, which isn't an option. But the options have D as -16.0 kJ. Hmm, that's not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial mole calculations.

Wait, let me recount the moles.

HCl: 0.2 M ×0.5 L =0.1 mol.

H2SO4: 0.3 M ×0.3 L =0.09 mol → provides 0.18 mol H+.

Ba(OH)2: 0.5 M ×0.2 L =0.1 mol → provides 0.2 mol OH-.

So, OH- is 0.2 mol, H+ is 0.28 mol.

Neutralization: 0.2 mol H+ reacts with 0.2 mol OH-.

Enthalpy: 0.2 × (-57,000 J) =-11,400 J →-11.4 kJ.

But none of the options match this. So perhaps I should revisit the problem statement.

Wait, the problem asks for the enthalpy of neutralization when these are mixed. So perhaps the process is exothermic, and the total is -11.4 kJ. If the options don't have that, perhaps I should reevaluate.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to consider the total H+ that could be neutralized, which is 0.2 mol, but the question includes all the H+ and OH-.

Wait, another thought: perhaps considering Ba(OH)2 as a base with two OH- per formula unit, but when it reacts with H2SO4, which has two H+ per formula unit. So the reaction is 1:1.

So, let's compute the moles of H+ and OH- again.

HCl: 0.2 M ×0.5 L=0.1 mol HCl →0.1 H+.

H2SO4: 0.3 M ×0.3 L=0.09 mol →0.18 H+.

Ba(OH)2: 0.5 M ×0.2 L=0.1 mol →0.2 OH-.

Total H+ =0.28, OH- =0.2.

So, the neutralization is 0.2 mol H+ (from HCl and H2SO4) reacting with 0.2 mol OH-.

So, enthalpy change: 0.2 × (-57,000 J) =-11,400 J →-11.4 kJ.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps the intended answer is option B, assuming the enthalpy is 57 kcal per mole.

But that's not standard. Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses a different value for the enthalpy.

Wait, perhaps the problem states that the enthalpy of neutralization is 57 kcal per mole. Then, 0.28 mol H+ ×57 kcal/mol →16 kJ? No, wait, 0.28 ×57 =15.96 → approx 16 kcal → which is option B as 11.42 is not matching.

Wait, but 0.2 mol ×57 kcal=11.4 kcal → option B.

I think I'm stuck between option A and B.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the answer in kJ but using 57 kJ per mole.

So the enthalpy would be -11.4 kJ. Looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ, which is not matching, so perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, another approach: maybe the problem is considering that Ba(OH)2 has two OH- per formula, so when it reacts with H2SO4, each mole of Ba(OH)2 neutralizes one mole of H2SO4, which provides two H+.

But perhaps the problem is considering that Ba(OH)2 is a strong base and each mole provides 2 OH-.

Wait, I think I'm going in circles.

In conclusion, the correct calculation is that 0.2 mol of H+ and OH- neutralize, releasing 0.2 ×57 =11.4 kJ. But the options don't have that. The closest in kcal is option B (-11.42 kcal), which would be if the enthalpy is 57 kcal per mole.

But since the standard enthalpy is 57 kJ, the correct answer in kJ would be -11.4, which isn't an option. So perhaps the intended answer is option B, assuming the enthalpy is 57 kcal/mol.

But I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial mole calculation.

Wait, another way: perhaps the problem is considering the total reaction, including the formation of BaSO4 and any other precipitates.

Wait, H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 would react to form BaSO4 precipitate and water.

The reaction is Ba(OH)2 + H2SO4 → BaSO4 ↓ + 2 H2O.

Moles of Ba(OH)2: 0.1 mol.

Moles of H2SO4: 0.09 mol.

So, H2SO4 is limiting. It will react with 0.09 mol Ba(OH)2.

Each mole of H2SO4 produces 2 H+.

So, in this reaction, 0.09 mol H2SO4 will react with 0.09 mol Ba(OH)2. The reaction releases heat, which is the enthalpy change.

The enthalpy change for this reaction can be calculated using the enthalpies of formation. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the neutralization enthalpy.

But for the purpose of this problem, perhaps the approach is to consider the total neutralization of H+ and OH-.

I think I've spent enough time thinking, and the correct approach leads me to -11.4 kJ, but since that's not an option, I'll have to choose the closest possible. If the question expects the answer in kJ, there's no match, but option D is -16.0 kJ, which is higher. Alternatively, option B is -11.42 kcal, which is roughly the same as -11.4 kJ converted to kcal. So I think the intended answer is option B.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when mixing 500 mL 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL 0.3 M H₂SO₄, and 200 mL 0.5 M Ba(OH)₂, the following steps were taken:

1. **Determine moles of H⁺ and OH⁻:**
   - **HCl (strong acid):**  
     Moles of HCl = \( 0.2 \, \text{M} \times 0.5 \, \text{L} = 0.1 \, \text{mol} \).  
     Since HCl dissociates completely, it contributes \( 0.1 \, \text{mol} \, \text{H}^+ \).
   - **H₂SO₄ (strong acid):**  
     Moles of H₂SO₄ = \( 0.3 \, \text{M} \times 0.3 \, \text{L} = 0.09 \, \text{mol} \).  
     Each mole of H₂SO₄ dissociates into 2 moles of \( \text{H}^+ \), so it contributes \( 0.09 \times 2 = 0.18 \, \text{mol} \, \text{H}^+ \).
   - **Ba(OH)₂ (strong base):**  
     Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = \( 0.5 \, \text{M} \times 0.2 \, \text{L} = 0.1 \, \text{mol} \).  
     Each mole of Ba(OH)₂ dissociates into 2 moles of \( \text{OH}^- \), so it contributes \( 0.1 \times 2 = 0.2 \, \text{mol} \, \text{OH}^- \).

2. **Neutralization reaction:**
   - Total \( \text{H}^+ \) = \( 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 \, \text{mol} \).  
   - Total \( \text{OH}^- \) = \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \).  
   - The limiting reagent is \( \text{OH}^- \), which neutralizes \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \, \text{H}^+ \), forming \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \, \text{H}_2\text{O} \).

3. **Enthalpy change:**
   - The standard enthalpy of neutralization for strong acids and bases is approximately \( -57 \, \text{kJ/mol} \) or \( -13.6 \, \text{kcal/mol} \).  
   - For \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \, \text{H}^+ \), the enthalpy change is:  
     \[
     \Delta H = 0.2 \times (-57 \, \text{kJ/mol}) = -11.4 \, \text{kJ}.
     \]
   - Converting to kcal:  
     \[
     -11.4 \, \text{kJ} \times \frac{1 \, \text{kcal}}{4.184 \, \text{kJ}} \approx -2.72 \, \text{kcal}.
     \]

4. **Analysis of options:**
   - **Option A (-2.72 kcal):** Matches the calculated value in kcal.  
   - **Option B (-11.42 kcal):** This would correspond to \( 0.28 \, \text{mol} \, \text{H}^+ \) reacting, which is inconsistent with the limiting reagent (\( \text{OH}^- \)).  
   - **Option C (-3.80 kcal):** Does not match any calculation.  
   - **Option D (-16.0 kJ):** Does not match the calculated value of \( -11.4 \, \text{kJ} \).

The correct answer is based on the standard enthalpy of neutralization and the limiting reagent. The enthalpy change is \( -11.4 \, \text{kJ} \), which corresponds to \( -2.72 \, \text{kcal} \). Therefore, the correct option is:

**Answer: A**
