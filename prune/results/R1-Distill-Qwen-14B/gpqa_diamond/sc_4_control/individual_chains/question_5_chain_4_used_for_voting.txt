Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem to solve, and honestly, I'm a bit nervous because eigenvectors and eigenvalues are a bit tricky for me. But let's take it step by step.

The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. The operator P has components P_x, P_y, and P_z, each given as matrices multiplied by ħ/2.

Hmm, wait, so operator P is a vector operator, right? So P = P_x x_hat + P_y y_hat + P_z z_hat. But wait, the direction n is arbitrary in the x-z plane. Oh, right, so the operator P here is along the direction n, which is in the x-z plane. So the operator in that direction would be a combination of Px and Pz.

Wait, but the operator given is for components along x, y, z. So when the direction is arbitrary, say, along a unit vector n making an angle θ with the z-axis and φ with the x-axis, but since it's in the x-z plane, φ is zero or maybe undefined because in x-z, y component is zero. So n would be (sinθ cosφ, 0, cosθ), but since it's in x-z, φ is zero. So n = (sinθ, 0, cosθ), where θ is the polar angle from the z-axis.

So the operator for the direction n would be the combination of P_x and P_z. Because in the x-z plane, the y-component of n is zero, so Py doesn't contribute here.

Wait, but wait, the operator is for the direction n, so it's P · n. So that would be P_x * n_x + P_z * n_z, because n_y is zero.

So the operator P in the direction n is (P_x * sinθ) + (P_z * cosθ). Because n_x is sinθ, and n_z is cosθ (since n is a unit vector).

Each of these components (P_x, P_y, P_z) are (ħ/2) times their respective matrices. So let me write down each component's matrix.

P_x matrix:
First row: 0, 1
Second row: 1, 0
So P_x = (ħ/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]]

P_y matrix:
First row: 0, -i
Second row: i, 0
So P_y = (ħ/2) * [[0,-i],[i,0]]

P_z matrix:
First row:1,0
Second row:0,-1
So P_z = (ħ/2) * [[1,0],[0,-1]]

So for the direction n, the operator P_n is sinθ * P_x + cosθ * P_z.

So let's compute that:

P_n = sinθ * (ħ/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]] + cosθ * (ħ/2) * [[1,0],[0,-1]]

Let me factor out (ħ/2):

P_n = (ħ/2) [ sinθ * [[0,1],[1,0]] + cosθ * [[1,0],[0,-1]] ]

Multiplying these out:

First matrix: sinθ * [[0,1],[1,0]] is [[0, sinθ], [sinθ, 0]]
Second matrix: cosθ * [[1,0],[0,-1]] is [[cosθ, 0], [0, -cosθ]]

Adding these two:
Top-left: cosθ
Top-right: sinθ
Bottom-left: sinθ
Bottom-right: -cosθ

So the combined matrix is [[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ]]

So P_n is (ħ/2) * [[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ]]

Wait, no, wait. Because P_n is (ħ/2) multiplied by that sum. So the matrix part is [[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ]], and the entire P_n is (ħ/2) times that matrix.

We're looking for the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue +ħ/2.

The eigenvalue equation is P_n |v> = (ħ/2) |v>

So let's write this as:

(ħ/2) * [[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ]] * [a, b]^T = (ħ/2) [a, b]^T

Wait, no. The eigenvalue equation is P_n |v> = λ |v>, where λ is the eigenvalue. Here, λ is +ħ/2.

So,

(ħ/2) * [[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ]] * [a; b] = (ħ/2) [a; b]

We can divide both sides by (ħ/2), which gives:

[[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ]] [a; b] = [a; b]

So the matrix equation becomes:

[ cosθ * a + sinθ * b ] = a
[ sinθ * a - cosθ * b ] = b

So, two equations:

1) cosθ a + sinθ b = a → (cosθ -1) a + sinθ b = 0
2) sinθ a - cosθ b = b → sinθ a + ( - cosθ -1 ) b = 0

Let me write these as:

Equation (1): (cosθ - 1) a + sinθ b = 0
Equation (2): sinθ a + (-cosθ -1) b = 0

We can solve for a and b.

Let me rearrange equation (1):

[ (cosθ - 1) ] a = - sinθ b → a = [ - sinθ / (cosθ -1) ] b

Hmm, but perhaps it's easier to express this as a ratio. Let's take equation (1):

(cosθ - 1) a + sinθ b = 0 → ( (1 - cosθ) ) a = sinθ b → [ (1 - cosθ) / sinθ ] a = b

Similarly, let's compute (1 - cosθ)/sinθ.

Wait, perhaps it's better to express b in terms of a.

From equation (1):

b = [ (1 - cosθ) / sinθ ] a

Similarly, check equation (2):

From equation (2):

sinθ a - (cosθ + 1) b = 0 → sinθ a = (cosθ + 1) b → b = [ sinθ / (cosθ + 1) ] a

So we have two expressions for b in terms of a.

So set the two expressions equal:

(1 - cosθ)/ sinθ  =  sinθ / (1 + cosθ )

Because [ (1 - cosθ)/sinθ ] = [ sinθ / (1 + cosθ) ]

Let me compute both sides.

Left side: (1 - cosθ)/(sinθ)
Right side: sinθ/(1 + cosθ )

Multiply both sides by sinθ (1+cosθ) to eliminate denominators:

(1 - cosθ)(1 + cosθ) )= (sinθ)^2

(1 - cos²θ) = sin²θ → which is correct because sin²θ = 1 - cos²θ.

So both expressions for b/a are the same, which is good. So the ratio is valid.

So, let me pick one of them. Let's take b = [ (1 - cosθ)/sinθ ] a.

So, let me denote the ratio as r = [ (1 - cosθ) / sinθ ]

So, b = r a.

So, the eigenvector can be written as [a; b] = [a; r a] = a [1; r ]

But since eigenvectors are defined up to a scalar multiple, we can set a = 1, and b = r.

But wait, we should also consider if a is zero. But if a is zero, then from equation (1): sinθ b =0. So if a=0, then equation (1) gives b=0, which is trivial. So the non-trivial solution is when a is not zero.

So, the eigenvector is proportional to [1; r], where r is (1 - cosθ)/sinθ.

Let me compute r in terms of half-angle identities. Because (1 - cosθ) = 2 sin²(θ/2), and sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2).

So,

r = [ 2 sin²(θ/2) ] / [ 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2) ) ] 
= [ sin(theta/2) ] / [ cos(theta/2) )
= tan(theta/2)

So r = tan(theta/2).

So, the eigenvector is [1; tan(theta/2)].

But we need to normalize this vector. So the normalization condition is |1|^2 + |tan(theta/2)|^2 = 1.

So,

1 + tan²(theta/2) = 1/( cos²(theta/2) ) → because 1 + tan² x = sec² x.

So, the normalization factor is cos(theta/2). Because 1/sqrt(1 + tan²(theta/2)) ) = cos(theta/2).

So, the normalized eigenvector is:

[ cos(theta/2) , sin(theta/2) ]^T.

Wait, because tan(theta/2) = sin(theta/2)/cos(theta/2), so the vector [1; tan(theta/2)] = [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]^T multiplied by 1/cos(theta/2). But wait, when you normalize, you multiply each component by cos(theta/2), because the norm is sqrt(1 + tan^2) ) = 1/cos(theta/2). So the normalized vector would be [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Wait, let me recalculate normalization.

The unnormalized vector is [1, tan(theta/2)]. The norm squared is 1 + tan²(theta/2) = 1/(cos²(theta/2)).

So the norm is 1 / |cos(theta/2)|. Since theta is an angle between 0 and pi (for a spin-1/2 particle), cos(theta/2) is positive, so the norm is 1/cos(theta/2).

So, to normalize, each component is multiplied by cos(theta/2).

So the normalized vector becomes:

[ cos(theta/2), tan(theta/2) * cos(theta/2) ]

But tan(theta/2) = sin(theta/2)/cos(theta/2), so the second component is [ sin(theta/2) ].

So the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]^T.

Wait, but this is only for the eigenvalue +ħ/2. Because we're looking for the eigenvalue +ħ/2, which corresponds to spin-up along the direction n.

So, the eigenvector components are (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Wait, but looking at the options, option C says cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2).

Option D has sqrt(2/3) and sqrt(1/3) factors, and multiplied by hbar, but I don't think that's correct because in this case, the normalized vector doesn't have any hbar factors. The eigenvector is a unit vector, so it's just the components.

Wait, looking back, the operator P_n is given, and the eigenvalue is +ħ/2. So the components are just the normalized spin-up state along direction n, which is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Wait, but let's check the options again.

Option C says (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which matches.

But wait, let's make sure. Are there any other factors? What about the direction of the muon's spin?

Wait, the eigenvalue is positive, so it's the +1/2 eigenstate. So for spin-1/2, the state is as derived: [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)]^T.

So the normalized eigenvector has components (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Looking at the options:

Option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Option D has sqrt(2/3) and sqrt(1/3) factors, multiplied by hbar and sin(theta/2). Hmm, that's possibly incorrect.

Wait, but the problem says that the operator P is given as each component multiplied by ħ/2. So the operator is dimensionless matrices multiplied by ħ/2.

But when finding the eigenvectors, the components are just the normalized spinors, without any factors of ħ, since the eigenvectors are in the Hilbert space of the spin, and are dimensionless.

So the eigenvectors are just [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)].

So the correct option is C, which presents this form.

Wait, but also, the user wrote the options with some formatting. Let me look again.

Option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Yes, that's what we have. So the correct answer is option C.

To solve the problem, we are tasked with finding the normalized eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator $\vec{P}$ for a muon along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The operator $\vec{P}$ has components $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$, each expressed as $(\hbar/2)$ times a $2 \times 2$ matrix. The direction $\vec{n}$ is in the x-z plane, making an angle $\theta$ with the z-axis. The operator along $\vec{n}$ is given by $\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = P_x \sin\theta + P_z \cos\theta$.

### Step 1: Construct the operator $\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n}$
The components of $\vec{P}$ are:
- $P_x = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}$,
- $P_z = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix}$.

The operator along $\vec{n}$ is:
\[
\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \left( \sin\theta \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix} + \cos\theta \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix} \right).
\]
Simplifying, we get:
\[
\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 2: Solve the eigenvalue equation
The eigenvalue equation is:
\[
\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix}.
\]
Substituting $\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n}$, we have:
\[
\frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix}.
\]
Dividing through by $\frac{\hbar}{2}$, the equation becomes:
\[
\begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix}.
\]

This gives the system of equations:
1. $(\cos\theta - 1)a + \sin\theta b = 0$,
2. $\sin\theta a + (-\cos\theta - 1)b = 0$.

From these, we find the ratio $b/a = \tan(\theta/2)$. Thus, the eigenvector can be written as:
\[
\begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = a \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ \tan(\theta/2) \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 3: Normalize the eigenvector
The normalization condition is:
\[
|a|^2 + |b|^2 = 1.
\]
Substituting $b = \tan(\theta/2) a$, we get:
\[
|a|^2 \left(1 + \tan^2(\theta/2)\right) = 1.
\]
Using the identity $1 + \tan^2(x) = \sec^2(x)$, this becomes:
\[
|a|^2 \sec^2(\theta/2) = 1 \implies |a| = \cos(\theta/2).
\]
Thus, the normalized eigenvector is:
\[
\begin{bmatrix} \cos(\theta/2) \\ \sin(\theta/2) \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 4: Analyze the options
- **Option A**: $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar, \sqrt{1/3}\hbar)$ — Incorrect, as it introduces unnecessary factors of $\hbar$ and does not match the derived eigenvector.
- **Option B**: $(\cos(\theta), e^{i\phi}\sin(\theta))$ — Incorrect, as it does not match the derived form.
- **Option C**: $(\cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2))$ — Correct, as it matches the normalized eigenvector derived above.
- **Option D**: $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar \cos(\theta/2), \sqrt{1/3}\hbar \sin(\theta/2))$ — Incorrect, as it introduces unnecessary factors of $\hbar$ and does not match the derived eigenvector.
