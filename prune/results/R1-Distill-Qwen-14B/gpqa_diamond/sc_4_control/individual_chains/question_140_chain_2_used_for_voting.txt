Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's take it slow because I'm a bit new to this.

The question is about a substance X reacting violently with liquid Y, releasing gas W, which forms a precipitate G. When G is heated, it releases B. The melting point of B is near 277 K, which is about 4 degrees Celsius. Also, when a keto acid reacts with substance X, the product has two oxygen atoms. Substance X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, especially its analog.

Alright, let's start breaking this down.

First, the reaction between X and Y. The fact that they react violently suggests it's a strong reaction, maybe something like a metal reacting with an acid. Gas W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. So, for a molecule, the number of neutrons and protons in each atom must be equal? Or does each atom have the same number as another?

Wait, the molecule as a whole has the same number of protons and neutrons. So, for example, if W is H2O, then protons are 2 (from H2) + 8 (from O) = 10. Neutrons in O-16 are 8, so total neutrons are 2*(1) from H and 8 from O, totaling 10. Oh, wait, H has one proton and no neutrons (assuming protium). So H2O has 10 protons and 10 neutrons? Let me check:

H has 1 proton, 0 neutrons. O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons (assuming O-16). So H2O would have 2*1 + 8 = 10 protons. For neutrons, 2*0 (from H) + 8 (from O) = 8. Wait, that doesn't add up. So 10 protons and 8 neutrons? That's a problem. So W's molecule must have equal protons and neutrons. So perhaps a molecule where each atom contributes equally.

Wait, maybe W is CO2? Let me see. CO2 has one C and two O atoms. C has 6 protons, O has 8 each. So total protons: 6 + 2*8 = 22. Neutrons: C (6) has 6 (for C-12) and O has 8 each. So 6 + 2*8 = 22. Oh, wait, so 22 protons and 22 neutrons. That fits. So W is CO2? Or maybe another compound.

Wait, another possibility is CH4. CH4 has 6 protons (C) + 4*1 (H) = 10 protons. Neutrons: C has 6, H has 0 each. So 6 neutrons. Doesn't match.

Wait, maybe W is NH3? Let's see: N has 7 protons, H has 1 each. So 7 + 3 =10 protons. Neutrons: N-14 has 7 neutrons. So total neutrons: 7 (N) + 3*0 (H) =7. Not equal to 10.

Hmm. Maybe W is something else. Let's think of other possibilities. What about O2? O2 has 16 (each O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons). So each O atom contributes 8 protons and 8 neutrons. Two O atoms: 16 protons and 16 neutrons. So total protons and neutrons are equal. Yeah, that's possible. So W could be O2. But O2 is diatomic, but would it form from a reaction like this?

Wait, another possibility: H2. H2 has 2 protons and 0 neutrons. Doesn't fit. But wait, if it's a heavier isotope, like D2 (deuterium), but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach. The precipitate G when heated releases B. B's melting point is about 277 K, which is near 4°C. So B could be a solid at room temperature but melts around that point. What's a common compound that does that? Maybe something like ice? No, ice melts at 273 K. Oh, 277 K is 4°C, so slightly higher than ice. Hmm. Maybe something like a waxy substance or some other crystalline material.

Wait, maybe B is water, but that's conflicting. Alternatively, maybe B is some salt.

Wait, perhaps G is a carbonate. When heated, it decomposes into B. Let's think: if G is calcium carbonate, heating it would produce CO2 and CaO. But CaO is a solid, and CO2 is a gas. But then B would be CO2 again. But melting point of CO2 is a solid at about 5.68 atm and a lower temp, but not sure.

Alternatively, if G is a metal hydroxide. For example, if Y is an acid, and X is a metal, then the reaction produces a metal hydroxide as precipitate. But when heated, metal hydroxides can decompose.

Wait, let's think about the reaction. X reacts with Y to produce W, G. If Y is an acid, say HCl, and X is a metal, like Mg, then the reaction would be Mg + 2HCl → MgCl2 + H2. Then W is H2, G is MgCl2? But MgCl2 is soluble, so maybe not. Or perhaps X is a carbonate? No, because then Y (acid) would produce CO2, which is W. Wait, but if X is a carbonate, when it reacts with acid, you get CO2, water, and a salt. But then G would be the salt, which perhaps is a precipitate. But if G is a carbonate, what happens when heated? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a metal that reacts with an acid to produce H2, which is W. Then the precipitate would be a salt. For example, Mg and HCl → MgCl2 and H2. Then G is MgCl2, but MgCl2 is soluble in water, so it wouldn't precipitate. Hmm.

Wait, maybe Y is not an acid but a solution of a salt. For example, if Y is a nitrate solution and X is a metal that displaces it, forming a precipitate. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe Y is a base. For example, if X is an acid, and Y is a base. But the reaction is violent, so maybe they're both strong. For example, concentrated sulfuric acid and a strong base could react violently, producing water and a salt. But the gas might be SO2 or something else.

Wait, the product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with X contains 2 atoms of oxygen. Keto acid is an acid with a ketone group, like acetoacetic acid or something. When it reacts with X, the product has two oxygen atoms. So maybe X is a base, and the product is a salt. So, for example, if the keto acid is something like CH3COCH2COOH, and X is NaOH, the reaction would produce a sodium salt. But not sure how that connects to the rest.

Wait, another angle: the product of X and a keto acid has two oxygen atoms. So, perhaps it's a simple reaction where X adds to the acid, like in an acid-base reaction. Or maybe X is a reducing agent, and it reduces the keto acid, but I'm not sure.

Wait, back to the initial reaction. X reacts with Y to produce W and G. G, when heated, releases B. B's melting point is close to 277 K, so around 4 degrees. That makes me think of ice melting at 273 K, but B is a bit higher. So maybe B is some other compound that's a solid at room temperature but melts around 4°C. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps B is a gas that condenses at that point, but that's less likely.

Wait, maybe B is ethanol. Wait, no, ethanol melts at -114°C. Alternatively, maybe something like a paraffin wax, which has a melting point around 45-60°C. But that doesn't fit.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should consider what the substance X is. The question says X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. So X has an isotope with a higher mass. And X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, especially its analog. Hmm. Common reagents in organic chemistry include things like NaOH, KMnO4, H2SO4, etc.

Wait, if X is a metal, like magnesium (Mg), which is often used as a reagent. Mg reacts with acids to produce H2 gas. Let's see: Mg + HCl → MgCl2 + H2. So W would be H2. But H2 has two H atoms. Each H has 1 proton and 0 neutrons. So W's molecule has 2 protons and 0 neutrons. But the question says the same number of protons and neutrons. So that doesn't fit. Hmm.

Alternatively, if X is a carbonate. Wait, no, because when a carbonate reacts with an acid, CO2 is released, and the precipitate would be a salt. But again, the salt would be soluble, perhaps.

Wait, perhaps X is an isotope-containing compound. For example, heavy water has deuterium (D2O), where D is an isotope of H. If X is D2O, then when it reacts with something, maybe Y is an acid, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: the product of X reacting with a keto acid has two oxygen atoms. Suppose the product is a diethyl ether or something, but that's stretching it. Alternatively, it's an ester, which might have more oxygen.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a base like NaOH, and the keto acid is something like acetic acid. NaOH + acetic acid → sodium acetate. Sodium acetate has formula CH3COONa, which has two oxygen atoms in the acetate ion (O from COO-). So the product would have 2 oxygen atoms. That could fit. So if X is NaOH, then Y might be something else.

Wait, but the first part says X reacts with Y to form W (gas) and precipitate G. If X is NaOH, what would Y be? Maybe Y is a nitrate or sulfate solution? Or perhaps Y is a metal carbonate, leading to CO2 release. For example, NaOH reacting with a metal carbonate would produce CO2 and a sodium salt. But NaOH is a strong base; would that form a precipitate?

Alternatively, perhaps Y is an acid. For example, H2SO4 and NaOH would react to form Na2SO4 and water, but that would be a neutralization reaction, producing no gas. So that doesn't fit the violent reaction and gas release.

Wait, but if Y is a weak acid, perhaps. Or maybe Y is something else. Alternatively, perhaps X is a metal, and Y is an acid. Let's say X is Mg, and Y is HCl. Then the reaction would produce MgCl2, H2 gas. So W is H2. Then, precipitate G would be MgCl2, but MgCl2 is soluble in water, so that can't be.

Hmm. Maybe X isn't a metal. What about X being a carbonate? Like CaCO3. If Y is HCl, the reaction would be CaCO3 + 2HCl → CaCl2 + CO2 + H2O. So W is CO2, and G is CaCl2, which is soluble, so no precipitate. That doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps X is a sulfide. Then Y could be an acid, producing H2S gas. But H2S has 2 protons and 2*0=0 neutrons, which doesn't fit the W condition.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a carbonate, and Y is an acid. Then W is CO2, which has 22 protons and 22 neutrons (as I thought earlier). Wait, CO2: each O is 8 protons and 8 neutrons, C is 6. So total protons: 6 + 2*8 = 22. Neutrons: 6 (C) + 2*8 (O) = 22. So yes, same number of protons and neutrons in the molecule. So W is CO2.

So if W is CO2, then the reaction is X (maybe a carbonate) reacting with Y (an acid) to produce CO2, water, and a salt. But then the precipitate would be the salt, which should be insoluble. So if X is CaCO3, reacting with HCl would produce CaCl2, which is soluble, so no precipitate. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps Y is a solution of a different salt. Maybe Y is a solution of a sulfide or something else. Alternatively, perhaps X is a metal nitrate and Y is an acid, but that seems unlikely to produce CO2.

Alternatively, maybe Y is a carbonate, and X is a metal. No, that might not produce CO2.

Wait, perhaps X is a bicarbonate. For example, NaHCO3 reacts with HCl to produce CO2, NaCl, H2O. So W is CO2, and G is NaCl. But NaCl is soluble, so no precipitate. Hmm. That's not matching.

Wait, perhaps Y is a different kind of solution. Let me think about the precipitate. If G is a precipitate, it must be an insoluble salt. So maybe when X (a carbonate) reacts with Y (a metal hydroxide), it produces a metal carbonate, which is insoluble. For example, if Y is a solution of Ba(OH)2, and X is Na2CO3, the reaction would be Na2CO3 + Ba(OH)2 → BaCO3 precipitate + 2NaOH. Then W would be nothing, but the problem says a gas is released. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think about B again. B is released when G is heated. If G is a carbonate, heating it might not release anything. Or if G is a hydroxide, heating might not release B either. Alternatively, perhaps G is a carbonate, and when heated, it decomposes into B and CO2. But then B would be the oxide. For example, CaCO3 → CaO + CO2 upon heating. So B is CaO. The melting point of CaO is around 2880°C, which is way higher than 277 K (4°C). So that doesn't fit.

Wait, another thought: B's melting point is near 277 K, which is close to 4°C. So what's a solid that melts around there? Maybe something like a very low melting point metal, but I can't think of any. Alternatively, maybe B is a different compound. Wait, maybe B is a gas under normal conditions, but when heated, it condenses? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps B is solid CO2 (dry ice), but its melting point is about 5.68 atm and -56.6°C. Not matching.

Wait, maybe B is a solid with a low melting point. Perhaps a primary alcohol like ethanol, but ethanol's melting point is much lower.

Wait, perhaps B is a solid formed from the reaction. Let me think of another approach.

The question also says that the product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen. So, for example, if the keto acid is something like acetoacetic acid (CH3C(O)CH2COOH), and X is something like NaOH, the product would be the sodium salt, which would have more oxygen.

But perhaps it's a simpler reaction. Let's say the keto acid is something like ethyl acetoacetate, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe X is a base like NaOH, and the product is a salt with two oxygen atoms. For example, if the keto acid is HCOOH (formic acid), reacting with NaOH would produce NaHCOO, which has two oxygen atoms (O from COO-). Wait, formate ion is HCOO^-, which has two oxygens in the COO group. So the product would be NaHCOO, which has two oxygen atoms in the ion. So that fits.

So if X is NaOH, then when it reacts with a keto acid like formic acid, the product has two oxygen atoms. That makes sense.

So, if X is NaOH, let's see. Then, X reacts with liquid Y. What could Y be? If Y is a carbonate, like Na2CO3, but that wouldn't produce a gas. Alternatively, Y could be an acid. But if X is NaOH, and Y is an acid, then the reaction would be neutralization, producing water and a salt, no gas. Unless Y is a weak acid that releases gas upon reaction with a base. Hmm, maybe not.

Wait, maybe Y is a solution of a metal carbonate. So X (NaOH) reacts with Y (a metal carbonate) to produce a sodium salt, CO2, and water. But then W is CO2, which fits the earlier condition of same protons and neutrons.

So for example, if Y is CaCO3, but wait, X is NaOH. NaOH + CaCO3 → Na2CO3 + Ca(OH)2. But that's not a gas. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a bicarbonate. For example, NaHCO3 reacts with NaOH to produce Na2CO3, H2O. No gas, so that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps Y is a nitrate. No, that wouldn't produce a gas.

Alternatively, maybe X is not NaOH but another hydroxide. Let's think, if X is Mg(OH)2, which is a weak base. If Y is an acid, like HCl, then the reaction would produce MgCl2, H2O, and possibly release HCl gas if it's a violent reaction. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the precipitate G when heated releases B, which has a melting point near 277 K. So G is a carbonate, perhaps, and when heated, it decomposes into an oxide (B) and CO2. But then B's melting point is that of the oxide. For example, if G is CaCO3, heating would produce CaO and CO2. The melting point of CaO is high, so that doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe B is a different compound. Let's think about the melting point of 277 K. That's about 4°C. What's a solid that's solid at room temperature and melts around that point? Maybe something like a very low melting point solid. I'm not recalling any common oxides with that property. Alternatively, perhaps B is a different gas, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, another thought: if B is a solid, maybe it's some kind of hydrate that melts at that temperature. For example, perhaps it's a hydrated salt. Wait, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe B is a solid formed from the reaction, but I'm not getting anywhere.

Let me try to think about the initial reaction again. If X is a metal, and Y is an acid, then W would be H2. But H2 has 2 protons and 0 neutrons. So that doesn't fit W's condition. So H2 doesn't work.

Wait, another possible gas: O2. O2 has 16 protons (each O has 8, two O atoms make 16) and 16 neutrons (each O-16 has 8, so 16 total). So W could be O2. If X is a metal reacting with a solution of a peroxide. For example, if X is K and Y is H2O2, then the reaction might produce O2. But I'm not sure if that's a violent reaction.

Alternatively, maybe X is MnO2 and reacts with concentrated HCl to produce Cl2 gas. Cl2 has 35.5 each Cl atom. So protons: 35.5*2? No, Cl has 17 protons each, so 34 total. Neutrons: Cl-35 has 18 neutrons each, so 36 total. That doesn't match.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction produces CO gas. CO has 1 proton and 1 neutron (if C-12 and O-16: C has 6 protons, 6 neutrons; O has 8 protons, 8 neutrons. Wait, CO has 6+8=14 protons and 6+8=14 neutrons. So total protons and neutrons are equal. So W could be CO. But CO is a toxic gas, but I'm not sure about the reaction.

Hmm, maybe the reaction is a decomposition of a carbonate. For example, if X is a carbonate, and Y is heat, perhaps. But the reaction is violent, so maybe it's a decomposition reaction that releases CO2.

Wait, another angle: the product of X and a keto acid has two oxygen atoms. If X is a base like NaOH, and the product is a sodium salt with two oxygen atoms, like sodium formate (HCOONa), which has two oxygen atoms in the formate ion. So that fits.

So, X is NaOH. Let's see: NaOH (substance X) reacts with Y (maybe a carbonate), producing CO2 (gas W), and precipitate G. But NaOH and a carbonate would react to form a sodium salt and CO2, but the sodium salt would be soluble, so no precipitate. Hmm. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe Y is a different solution. Let me think, if X is NaOH and Y is a nitrate solution, perhaps of a metal, but that might not produce a gas.

Wait, perhaps Y is a solution of a sulfide. For example, NaOH + H2S → Na2S + H2O. But that doesn't produce a gas.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a solution of a metal hydroxide. Not sure.

Wait, maybe Y is a neutral salt solution, and X is a strong base. For example, X is NaOH, Y is AlCl3. The reaction would produce NaCl and Al(OH)3 precipitate. Then, when Al(OH)3 is heated, it decomposes into Al2O3 and H2O. But the gas W would be H2O vapor, but that's a liquid under standard conditions. So W wouldn't be a gas.

This is getting complicated. Maybe I should go back to the options.

The options are A)35, B)25, C)31, D)29.

The question is about the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X. Considering if multiple instances exist, sum all heavier and lighter isotopes.

So, I need to find the lightest and heaviest elements in X and sum their atomic masses.

If X is NaOH, the elements are Na, O, H.

Na has atomic mass about 23, O is 16, H is 1. So the lightest is H (1), heaviest is Na (23). Sum is 24. But none of the options are 24.

Wait, but the question says to consider if multiple instances exist, sum all the heavier and lighter isotopes. Oh wait, no: the question says to sum all heavier and lighter isotopes present. Hmm, perhaps I need to look for something else.

Wait, perhaps X is another reagent. Let me think, another common reagent is Na2CO3. No, I don't think so.

Wait, another thought: the product of X and a keto acid has two oxygen atoms. So maybe X is a diol, and in the reaction, it adds two OH groups, but that's not relevant.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a carbonyl reagent, like KMnO4. Let's see: KMnO4 is a strong oxidizing agent, often used in organic chemistry. When it reacts with a keto acid, perhaps it oxidizes it. But the product would have more oxygen.

Wait, but then what about the reaction with Y? If X is KMnO4, and Y is an acid, maybe HCl, then the reaction could produce MnCl2, KCl, and Cl2 gas. Cl2 has 35.5 each Cl atom. So protons: 17*2 =34. Neutrons: Cl-35 has 18 neutrons each, so 36. 34 vs 36 – not equal. So that doesn't fit W.

Alternatively, if the reaction produces O2, which we thought about earlier. But how?

Wait, maybe X is a metal, like Zn, and Y is a solution of HNO3. The reaction could produce NO gas. Let's see: NO has 7 (N) + 8 (O) =15 protons, and 7 (N) + 8 (O) =15 neutrons. So same number. So W could be NO.

If X is Zn, Y is concentrated HNO3. The reaction is Zn + 4HNO3 → Zn(NO3)2 + 2NO↑ + 2H2O. So W is NO.

Then, the precipitate G would be Zn(NO3)2, but that's soluble. So no precipitate. That doesn't fit.

Hmm. Maybe another metal. Let's try Mg with HNO3. The reaction would produce NO2, perhaps. Mg + 4HNO3 → Mg(NO3)2 + 2NO2↑ + 2H2O. NO2 has 7+8=15 protons and 7+8=15 neutrons (if N is 14 and O is 16). So W could be NO2. Then, G would be Mg(NO3)2, which is soluble. So again, no precipitate.

Hmm. Not matching.

Wait, perhaps the reaction produces a precipitate when X reacts with Y. Let me think of a reaction where a metal reacts with a solution to form an insoluble salt. For example, AgNO3 solution and NaCl. AgNO3 + NaCl → AgCl↓ + NaNO3. So W would be nothing, but problem states a gas is released. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, but perhaps Y is a carbonate, and X is a metal. For example, Fe and Na2CO3. Fe + Na2CO3 + H2O → FeCO3 + 2NaOH. FeCO3 is insoluble, so G is FeCO3. Then, when heated, FeCO3 decomposes into FeO and CO2. So B is FeO. The melting point of FeO is about 1300°C, which is way higher than 277 K. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps G is a hydroxide. For example, if X is Fe and Y is NaOH. Fe + 2NaOH → Fe(OH)2 + Na2. But I'm not sure about this reaction. Fe(OH)2 is not very stable; it oxidizes to Fe(OH)3. When heated, Fe(OH)3 decomposes into Fe2O3 and H2O. But again, melting points are way higher.

Wait, perhaps G is a carbonate. Let me think, if X is Na2CO3 and Y is CaCl2, then Na2CO3 + CaCl2 → CaCO3↓ + 2NaCl. So G is CaCO3. When heated, CaCO3 decomposes into CaO and CO2. B is CaO. As before, CaO's melting point is way higher.

Hmm. I'm not getting closer. Maybe I need to think about the elements in X. The options for the sum are 25, 29, 31, 35.

If the sum is 35, that could be Cl (35.5) and maybe H (1), but 35.5 +1=36.5, which is not an option. Alternatively, if X contains Na and O, sum 23 + 16 =39, not matching.

Wait, another possibility: X contains H and O. So H is 1, O is 16. Sum is 17. Not in the options.

Wait, what if X contains C and O. For example, CO2. Then C is 12, O is 16. Sum is 28. Not an option.

Wait, another thought: if X is a compound with two different isotopes. For example, if X is D2O (heavy water), then the lightest element is H (1) and the heaviest is O (16). So sum is 17. Not in the options.

Wait, but the question says to sum the lightest and heaviest elements in X. So for X, find the lightest and heaviest elements, sum their atomic masses.

If X is NaOH, the elements are Na, O, H. Lightest is H (1), heaviest is Na (23). Sum is 24. But that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps X is something else. Let me think about the product with a keto acid. The product has two oxygen atoms. So maybe the product is a diethyl ether or something, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe X is a base like KOH. Let's see: KOH + a keto acid → a potassium salt. For example, if the keto acid is HCOOH (formic acid), then KOH + HCOOH → K HCOO + H2O. The product has two O atoms in the formate ion. So that fits.

So X is KOH. Then, KOH reacts with Y. What could Y be? If Y is a carbonate, like CaCO3, then KOH + CaCO3 → K2CO3 + Ca(OH)2. But Ca(OH)2 is a precipitate. So G is Ca(OH)2. When heated, Ca(OH)2 decomposes into CaO and H2O. B is CaO. But CaO's melting point is very high, so that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a nitrate. KOH + HNO3 → KNO3 + H2O. No gas released, so that doesn't fit W.

Hmm. Another thought: if Y is H2SO4. Then, KOH + H2SO4 → K2SO4 + 2H2O. No gas, so W wouldn't be formed.

Wait, perhaps Y is a solution of a metal carbonate, and the reaction produces CO2 as W. For example, KOH + Na2CO3 → 2KCO3 + NaOH. But NaOH is aqueous, and KCO3 is soluble, so no precipitate. Doesn't fit.

This is getting frustrating. Maybe I should think about the possible isotopes. The question says X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. So perhaps X is a compound with a heavier isotope, like Cl-35 instead of Cl-37, or something like that.

Wait, if X is Cl-35, but I think X is a compound, not an element.

Wait, perhaps X is CHCl3. Then, the elements are C, H, Cl. Lightest is H (1), heaviest is Cl (35.5). Sum is 36.5 → close to option A)35, but not exact. But maybe we're considering whole numbers. So 35.5 (Cl) +1 (H) =36.5, but the options don't have that.

Alternatively, if X is CCl4. Then, C is 12, Cl is 35.5. Sum 12+35.5=47.5, not an option.

Wait, another possibility: X is C2H5OH (ethanol). Elements are C, H, O. Lightest is H (1), heaviest is O (16). Sum 17, not an option.

Wait, let's think about the options again. The options are 25, 29, 31, 35.

If the sum is 25, possible elements: 12 (C) +13 (Al) =25? No, 12+13=25. So perhaps X contains C and Al.

But why would X be a compound with C and Al? Maybe aluminum carbide? Al4C3. But I'm not sure about its reactions.

Alternatively, 25 could be 14 (N) +11 (Na) =25. So X contains N and Na.

Wait, if X is NH4OH (ammonium hydroxide). Then elements are N, H, O. Lightest is H (1), heaviest is N (14) or O (16). So sum is 17 or 20, which doesn't match 25.

Hmm. Another possibility: 25 is the sum of 12 (C) + 13 (Al). Or 1 (H) +24 (Mg) =25. So X could be Mg and H.

Wait, Mg and H? MgH2 is a compound, but I'm not sure about its properties.

Alternatively, if X is Mg, which is used in organic reactions. Mg reacts with ketones in Grignard reagents. So when Mg reacts with a ketone, it forms a Grignard reagent. The product would be RMgX, which is a strong base.

So when Mg (X) reacts with a keto acid (like a ketonic acid), the product would be a Grignard-like compound, but I'm not sure about the oxygen count.

Alternatively, perhaps X is Mg, and when it reacts with a keto acid, it forms a magnesium salt. For example, Mg(OH)2, but that may not fit.

Wait, the product of the reaction of X and a keto acid contains two oxygen atoms. So maybe it's a magnesium salt with two oxygens. Like MgO2? No, that doesn't exist. Or perhaps Mg(OH)2, which has two O and two H. But product would have more oxygens.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a magnesium carboxylate, which has a structure like Mg(CH2COO)2. Each carboxylate has two O. So sum would be two O in the product.

But I'm not sure how this ties back to the initial reaction.

Wait, going back, perhaps X is Mg. So Mg reacts with Y (maybe an acid) to produce H2 gas (W), and a magnesium salt as precipitate G. But Mg salts are usually soluble, so precipitate might not form.

Wait, but if Y is a sulfate solution, MgSO4, then Mg would displace it. Mg + MgSO4 → not sure. Maybe it's more complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a carbonate. Mg + Na2CO3 → MgCO3 + Na2. MgCO3 is a precipitate. When heated, MgCO3 decomposes into MgO and CO2. So B is MgO. The melting point of MgO is about 2800°C, which is way higher than 277 K. Doesn't fit.

Wait, but the melting point given is about 277 K, which is around 4°C. So perhaps B is some hydrate that melts at that point. Alternatively, perhaps B is a primary alcohol. Wait, ethanol's melting point is around -114°C, so that's too low.

Wait, perhaps B is water ice, but that's at 273 K. Close to 277 K, but not exact. Maybe a different compound.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Let me try to think about the sum again. The options are 25, 29, 31, 35.

If X is NaOH, the sum is Na (23) + O (16) + H (1). The lightest is H (1), heaviest Na (23). Sum 24, not an option.

If X is KOH, same logic: K (39), O (16), H (1). Sum K+H=40. Not an option.

Wait, could X be something else? Maybe X is NH3. But NH3 is a gas, and I'm not sure about its reactivity in this context.

Wait, another approach: the product of X and a keto acid has two oxygen atoms. So perhaps X is a base with one oxygen, and the product has two. For example, X is NaOH (one O), reacting with a keto acid (like formic acid, which has two O). The product would be sodium formate, which has two O in the formate ion. So that fits.

So if X is NaOH, then the elements in X are Na (23), O (16), H (1). Lightest is H (1), heaviest Na (23). Sum 24. Not an option.

Wait, but the options don't have 24. Hmm. Maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps X is a diatomic molecule. For example, X is H2O. Then, when it reacts with Y, maybe an acid like H2SO4, but not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a different compound. Let's think of possible reagents used in organic chemistry. Maybe something like DMSO (CH3SOCH3). It's used as a polar aprotic solvent and a reagent. Let's see: DMSO is (CH3)2SO.

So, elements are C, H, S, O. Lightest is H (1), heaviest is S (32.07). Sum 1 +32.07 =33.07, which is close to option C)31. But not exact.

Alternatively, maybe X is CH3OH (methanol). Elements are C (12), H (1), O (16). Lightest H (1), heaviest O (16). Sum 17, not an option.

Wait, another reagent is H2O2 (hydrogen peroxide). It's used in organic reactions. X could be H2O2. Then, when it reacts with Y, perhaps an acid, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but let's think about the initial reaction. If X is H2O2, and Y is a solution like KI, the reaction might produce O2 gas. O2 has same number of protons and neutrons, which fits W.

So, reaction: H2O2 + 2KI → I2 + 2KOH + O2↑. So W is O2. Then, precipitate G would be I2. When heated, I2 would sublime, but that's more about state change than releasing a compound. Hmm, but the problem says when heated, it releases B. So if G is I2, heating it would just turn it to vapor, not a solid. Not sure.

Alternatively, if X is H2O2 and Y is something else. Let's say Y is a metal, like Fe. H2O2 + Fe → FeO + H2O + O2↑. Then, W is O2, which fits. The precipitate G would be FeO. Heating FeO would produce Fe3O4 and release O2. But the melting point of FeO is about 1300°C, which doesn't fit.

Hmm. I'm not making progress. Maybe I should look for the sum in the options and see which makes sense.

Options are 25, 29, 31, 35. So:

- 25: Maybe 12 (C) +13 (Al) → 25? Or 1 (H) +24 (Mg) →25. So X could be MgH2 or AlC.

- 29: 14 (N) +15 (O) →29. Or 12 (C) +17 (Cl) →29. Hmm.

- 31: 15 (P) +16 (O) →31, but that's 31. Or 12 (C) +19 (K) →31. Not sure.

- 35: 14 (N) + 21 (Sc) →35. Not common. Or 16 (O) + 19 (K) →35.

Wait, another approach: the product of X and a keto acid has two O atoms. So maybe X is a base with one O, like NaOH. The product would have two O. So that fits.

If X is NaOH, then the elements in X are Na (23), O (16), H (1). Lightest is H (1), heaviest is Na (23). Sum is 24. Not an option.

Wait, perhaps X is something else. Let me think of another reagent: maybe it's a halogen. For example, Cl2 is a reagent in some reactions.

So, X is Cl2. Let's see: Cl2 is diatomic. When it reacts with a liquid Y, perhaps water, the reaction is Cl2 + H2O → HClO + HCl. But that's not a violent reaction. Alternatively, Cl2 with a metal like Fe would produce FeCl3. But I'm not sure about the gas.

Alternatively, maybe Y is a hydrocarbon. Cl2 with methane under UV light produces HCl and CH2Cl, but that's substitution, not a violent reaction.

Hmm. I'm getting stuck again.

Wait, perhaps X is Hg. Hg is a liquid metal, but the question says X is a substance, not necessarily a liquid. Let me think: Hg reacts with Y, perhaps a nitric acid, to produce Hg(NO3)2, NO2, and H2O. The gas W would be NO2, which has 15 protons and 15 neutrons. So that fits.

Then, precipitate G would be Hg(NO3)2, which is soluble, so no precipitate. Doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a carbonate. Hg + Na2CO3 → HgCO3 + 2Na. HgCO3 is a precipitate. When heated, HgCO3 decomposes into HgO and CO2. B is HgO. The melting point of HgO is about 800°C, which is way higher than 277 K.

Hmm. Not matching.

Wait, another thought: if X is a carbonate, and Y is an acid, producing CO2. So X is maybe Na2CO3. Then, Y is HCl. Reaction: Na2CO3 + 2HCl → 2NaCl + CO2↑ + H2O. So W is CO2. Precipitate G is NaCl, which is soluble. So no precipitate. Doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps Y is a solution of Ba(OH)2. Then, Na2CO3 + Ba(OH)2 → BaCO3↓ + 2NaOH. BaCO3 is a precipitate. When heated, BaCO3 decomposes into BaO and CO2. B is BaO, which has a high melting point. Doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a solution of AgNO3. Na2CO3 + 2AgNO3 → 2NaNO3 + Ag2CO3. Ag2CO3 is a precipitate. When heated, it decomposes into 2AgO + CO2. B is AgO. The melting point of AgO is about 1530°C, not matching.

I'm stuck again. Maybe I should try to think of the sum again. The options are 25, 29, 31, 35.

If the answer is 25, which could be H (1) + Mg (24.3). So the elements are H and Mg. So X must contain both. Maybe X is MgH2, which is a compound. When MgH2 reacts with something, perhaps an acid, it releases H2 gas. Let's see: MgH2 + 2HCl → MgCl2 + 2H2↑. So W is H2. But H2 has 2 protons and 0 neutrons. Doesn't fit W's condition.

Alternatively, if X is Mg, and Y is a solution of HNO3. Mg + 4HNO3 → Mg(NO3)2 + 2NO2↑ + 2H2O. So W is NO2, which has 15 protons and 15 neutrons. Fits.

Then, precipitate G is Mg(NO3)2, which is soluble. So no precipitate. Doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps X is MgO. MgO is a solid. When reacts with Y, maybe an acid. MgO + 2HCl → MgCl2 + H2O. No gas. Doesn't fit.

Alternatively, X is Mg(OH)2. Reacts with an acid, like HCl, to produce MgCl2 and H2O. No gas. Doesn't fit.

Hmm. Another thought: if X is Na2S. Reacts with an acid like HCl → 2NaCl + H2S↑. W is H2S. H2S has 2 protons and 20.08 (S) neutrons (wait, S has 16 protons and 16 neutrons in S-32). So H2S: H has 1 each, S has 16. So total protons: 2 +16=18. Neutrons: 0*2 +16=16. 18≠16. Doesn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe W is SO2. SO2 has 16 (S) + 16 (O2) protons: 16+16=32. Neutrons: 16 (S) + 16 (O2) =32. So same. So W could be SO2.

If X is Na2SO3, and Y is H2SO4. Reaction: Na2SO3 + H2SO4 → Na2SO4 + SO2↑ + H2O. So W is SO2. Then, precipitate G would be Na2SO4, which is soluble. Doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a solution of Ba(NO3)2. X is Na2SO3. Reaction: Na2SO3 + Ba(NO3)2 → BaSO3↓ + 2NaNO3. BaSO3 is a precipitate. When heated, BaSO3 decomposes into BaSO4 and H2O. B is BaSO4. The melting point of BaSO4 is about 1580°C, which doesn't fit.

I'm running out of ideas. Let me try to think about the sum again. The options are:

A) 35 → perhaps Cl (35.5) + H (1) =36.5, but not exact.

B)25 → H (1) + Mg (24.3) →25.3.

C)31 → maybe O (16) + P (31) →47. Doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe the sum is 35.5 (Cl) and 0 (if another element is considered as 0, which isn't possible). Hmm.

Alternatively, if X is Cl2, the elements are Cl. So only Cl, but the question specifies the lightest and heaviest elements. So since it's the same element, the sum would be Cl's atomic mass times two. But that doesn't fit.

Wait, another approach: perhaps X is a diatomic molecule of a heavier isotope. For example, X is D2 (deuterium). But then, when reacting with Y, which might be O2, to form H2O. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, X is O2, but that's unlikely.

I think I'm stuck. Given the time I've spent, maybe I should make an educated guess based on the options and the possible sum.

The most plausible scenario is that X is NaOH. The sum of the lightest (H, 1) and heaviest (Na, 23) elements is 24. But since that's not an option, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, another possibility: X is KOH. Then, K (39), O (16), H (1). Sum K + H =40. Not an option.

Wait, maybe X is a compound with elements other than Na or K. Let me think, perhaps X is Mg(OH)2. Then elements are Mg (24.3), O (16), H (1). The lightest is H (1), heaviest Mg (24.3). Sum 25.3. Close to option B)25.

So the sum would be approximately 25, which is option B.

But wait, earlier I thought X is NaOH, but that gives a sum of 24. But if X is Mg(OH)2, the sum is about 25. So option B.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves identifying the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in Substance X, based on its reactions and properties. Here's the analysis:

1. **Reaction and Gas W**:  
   Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing gas W. The molecule of W has the same number of protons and neutrons. Possible candidates for W include CO₂ (22 protons and 22 neutrons) or O₂ (16 protons and 16 neutrons). These gases suggest that X may involve carbon, oxygen, or hydrogen in its composition.

2. **Precipitate G and Heating to Form B**:  
   The reaction produces a precipitate G, which releases B upon heating. The melting point of B is approximately 277 K (4°C). This suggests B could be a low-melting-point solid, possibly a hydrate or a compound that decomposes to release a gas.

3. **Reaction with a Keto Acid**:  
   The product of X reacting with a keto acid contains 2 oxygen atoms. This implies X likely contains oxygen and reacts with the keto acid to form a salt or compound with two oxygen atoms in the product.

4. **Substance X as a Reagent**:  
   X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, often in reactions like acid-base reactions or reductions. Common reagents include NaOH, KOH, or Mg-based compounds like Grignard reagents.

5. **Isotope Incorporation**:  
   X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. This suggests X may involve isotopes like deuterium (²H) or heavier isotopes of oxygen or chlorine.

6. **Cumulative Atomic Mass Calculation**:  
   The question asks for the sum of the atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X. Possible candidates for X include NaOH, KOH, Mg(OH)₂, or compounds like CHCl₃. For Mg(OH)₂, the lightest element is hydrogen (H, atomic mass ≈ 1), and the heaviest is magnesium (Mg, atomic mass ≈ 24.3). The cumulative atomic mass is approximately 1 + 24.3 = 25.3, which aligns closely with option **B) 25**.

Given the analysis, the most plausible answer is **B) 25**, corresponding to the cumulative atomic masses of hydrogen and magnesium in Mg(OH)₂ or a similar compound.

Answer: B
