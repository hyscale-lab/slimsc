Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem, and I need to think it through step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

So, we have two stars, Star 1 and Star 2. Star 1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star 2. Similarly, Star 1's mass is 1.5 times that of Star 2. The astronomers found that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, wait, that's the peak wavelength for each star. So they have the same peak emission wavelength.

Then, the radial velocities are given: Star 1 has a velocity of 0 km/s, and Star 2 is moving at 700 km/s. Hmm, wait, radial velocity usually refers to the velocity along the line of sight, right? So Star 2 is moving away from us or towards us? Well, the sign would tell, but the problem doesn't specify. But I think for the purposes of this problem, we're just given their velocities, and perhaps we'll need to consider the Doppler effect for their observed wavelengths, but wait, the problem states that the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. Oh, maybe that's their observed wavelengths, so we need to account for Doppler shift.

Wait, but the problem says that the astronomers determined the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and found they are the same. So the observed peak wavelengths are the same. But each star's actual emitted peak wavelength might be different because of their velocities.

Wait, but what's the peak wavelength of a blackbody? It's given by Wien's Law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant (~2.898×10^-3 m·K), and T is the effective temperature.

So the observed λ_max would be affected by the Doppler effect if the star is moving relative to the observer. For small velocities compared to the speed of light, we can approximate the Doppler shift as Δλ/λ ≈ v/c, where v is the radial velocity and c is the speed of light (~3×10^5 km/s). But wait, 700 km/s is much smaller than c, so this approximation should be okay.

So, let me think. Let's denote Star 1 as S1 and Star 2 as S2. Their actual emitted peak wavelengths (λ1 and λ2) would be related to their temperatures. But what we observe is λ1_observed and λ2_observed, which are the same, per the problem.

Wait, but the problem says that the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So the observed λ_max for both stars is the same. So λ1_obs = λ2_obs.

But why? Let's think about each star's actual emission. For each star, the actual λ_max is determined by their temperature. So, for each, λ_max = b / T. So their temperatures are T1 = b / λ1 and T2 = b / λ2.

But because of their velocities, we observe a shifted wavelength. So the observed wavelength λ1_obs is λ1 multiplied by (1 + v1/c), assuming v1 is positive when moving away, which causes redshift. Similarly, λ2_obs is λ2 multiplied by (1 + v2/c).

Wait, but in the problem, Star 1 has a radial velocity of 0 km/s, so v1 = 0. Star 2 has a velocity of 700 km/s. So v2 = 700 km/s. But wait, is it moving away or towards? If moving towards, the observed wavelength would be blueshifted, so (1 - v2/c). But the problem doesn't specify the direction, so perhaps it's an outflow, but without knowing, maybe it's just the magnitude. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating, and the problem is set up such that the observed λ_max is the same for both.

Wait, perhaps I should model this. Let me write down the equations.

We know that the observed λ_max for each star is the same. So:

λ1_obs = λ2_obs.

But λ1_obs is the Doppler-shifted version of the actual λ1 from S1. Similarly for λ2_obs.

So λ1_obs = λ1 * (1 + v1/c), assuming v1 is the radial velocity. Wait, but the formula for Doppler shift when the source is moving away is λ_obs = λ_source * (1 + v/c), where v is positive if moving away. If the source is moving towards us, v is negative, so the observed wavelength is shorter.

But in our case, S1 has v = 0, so λ1_obs = λ1 * (1 + 0) = λ1.

S2 has v = 700 km/s. Let's assume it's moving away, so v is positive. So λ2_obs = λ2 * (1 + 700/c).

But since λ1_obs = λ2_obs,

λ1 = λ2 * (1 + 700/c).

Wait, but λ1 is the actual λ_max for S1, which is b / T1. Similarly, λ2 is b / T2.

So substituting:

b/T1 = (b/T2) * (1 + 700/c).

We can cancel out b:

1/T1 = (1/T2) * (1 + 700/c)

=> T1 = T2 / (1 + 700/c)

But what is 700/c? Let's calculate that.

c is approximately 3e5 km/s. So 700/(3e5) = 0.002333... So 1 + 0.002333 is approximately 1.002333.

So T1 ≈ T2 / 1.002333 ≈ 0.997666 * T2.

So T1 is a bit less than T2.

Wait, but then how does this affect the luminosity?

Luminosity of a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4π R² σ T^4.

So for each star, L1 = 4π R1² σ T1^4, L2 = 4π R2² σ T2^4.

We can take the ratio L1/L2:

(L1)/(L2) = (R1² T1^4) / (R2² T2^4)

We know R1 = 1.5 R2.

So R1/R2 = 1.5.

So R1² / R2² = (1.5)^2 = 2.25.

So the R part contributes 2.25.

For the T part: T1^4 / T2^4 = (T1/T2)^4.

From earlier, T1 ≈ T2 * (1 - 700/c) ≈ T2 * (1 - 0.002333) ≈ T2 * 0.9976667.

So T1/T2 ≈ 0.9976667.

So (T1/T2)^4 ≈ (0.9976667)^4.

Let me compute that.

0.9976667 is approximately 0.9976667.

Let me compute it step by step.

0.9976667^2 = (approx) 0.9953333, because (1 - 0.002333)^2 ≈ 1 - 2*0.002333 = 0.995334.

Then, square that again: 0.9953333^2 ≈ 0.9907.

Wait, let me compute more accurately.

Alternatively, since (1 - x)^n ≈ 1 - n x when x is small.

Here x=0.002333, n=4.

So (0.9976667)^4 ≈ 1 - 4 * 0.002333 = 1 - 0.009333 = 0.9906667.

But for more precision, let's compute (0.9976667)^4.

First, compute 1 - 0.002333 = 0.9976667.

Compute square: (0.9976667)^2 = approximately 0.9953333.

Then square again: (0.9953333)^2 = ?

Let me compute 0.9953333 * 0.9953333.

Compute 0.9953333 * 0.9953333:

= (1 - 0.0046667) * (1 - 0.0046667) = 1 - 2 * 0.0046667 + (0.0046667)^2 ≈ 1 - 0.0093334 + 0.00002178 ≈ 0.99068838.

So approximately 0.990688.

So (T1/T2)^4 ≈ 0.990688.

So putting it all together:

L1/L2 = (2.25) * (0.990688) ≈ 2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ approximately 2.227.

Hmm, so approximately 2.227.

Looking at the options, option D is ~2.23, which matches this.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations.

Wait, another approach: compute T1 = T2 / (1 + v/c).

Where v = 700 km/s.

But 700 / (3e5) = 0.002333.

So 1 + v/c = 1.002333.

So T1 = T2 / 1.002333 ≈ T2 * 0.997667.

So (T1/T2)^4 = (0.997667)^4.

We can compute this more accurately.

But perhaps it's easier to compute (1 - 0.002333)^4.

Using binomial expansion:

(1 - x)^4 ≈ 1 - 4x + 6x² - 4x³ + x^4.

x = 0.002333.

So,

1 - 4*(0.002333) = 1 - 0.009332 = 0.990668.

6x² =6*(0.002333)^2 =6*(5.44e-6) ≈ 0.00003264.

So 0.990668 + 0.00003264 = 0.99070064.

Then subtract 4x³: 4*(0.002333)^3 =4*(1.289e-8) ≈ 5.156e-8.

Which is negligible, and x^4 is even smaller.

So approximately 0.9907.

So (T1/T2)^4 ≈ 0.9907.

So L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4 = (1.5)^2 * (0.9907) = 2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ 2.227.

So about 2.227, which is approximately 2.23, so option D.

To determine the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 exceeds that of Star_2, we use the Stefan-Boltzmann law for luminosity:

\[
L = 4\pi R^2 \sigma T^4
\]

The ratio of the luminosities is given by:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \left(\frac{R_1}{R_2}\right)^2 \left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4
\]

### Step 1: Radii Ratio
The problem states that \( R_1 = 1.5 R_2 \). Thus:

\[
\left(\frac{R_1}{R_2}\right)^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25
\]

### Step 2: Temperature Ratio
The temperature of a blackbody is inversely related to the peak wavelength of its emission via Wien's law:

\[
\lambda_{\text{max}} = \frac{b}{T}
\]

The observed peak wavelengths of the two stars are the same (\( \lambda_{\text{max, obs}} \)), but the actual emitted wavelengths are Doppler-shifted due to the radial velocities of the stars. For Star_1 (\( v_1 = 0 \, \text{km/s} \)) and Star_2 (\( v_2 = 700 \, \text{km/s} \)), the relationship between their observed and emitted wavelengths is:

\[
\lambda_{\text{max, obs}} = \lambda_{\text{max, emitted}} \cdot (1 + v/c)
\]

For Star_1:
\[
\lambda_{1, \text{obs}} = \lambda_1
\]

For Star_2:
\[
\lambda_{2, \text{obs}} = \lambda_2 \cdot (1 + v_2/c)
\]

Since \( \lambda_{1, \text{obs}} = \lambda_{2, \text{obs}} \), we have:

\[
\lambda_1 = \lambda_2 \cdot (1 + v_2/c)
\]

Substituting \( \lambda_1 = b/T_1 \) and \( \lambda_2 = b/T_2 \), we get:

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \frac{1}{1 + v_2/c}
\]

The speed of light \( c \) is approximately \( 3 \times 10^5 \, \text{km/s} \), so:

\[
\frac{v_2}{c} = \frac{700}{3 \times 10^5} \approx 0.002333
\]

Thus:

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} \approx \frac{1}{1 + 0.002333} \approx 0.997667
\]

### Step 3: Temperature Ratio to the Fourth Power
The temperature ratio raised to the fourth power is:

\[
\left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4 \approx (0.997667)^4
\]

Using the binomial approximation for small \( x \), where \( x = 0.002333 \):

\[
(1 - x)^4 \approx 1 - 4x
\]

Substituting \( x = 0.002333 \):

\[
(0.997667)^4 \approx 1 - 4(0.002333) = 1 - 0.009333 = 0.990667
\]

### Step 4: Combine Results
Substituting into the luminosity ratio:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \left(\frac{R_1}{R_2}\right)^2 \cdot \left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4 = 2.25 \cdot 0.990667 \approx 2.227
\]

### Final Answer
The luminosity of Star_1 is approximately 2.23 times greater than that of Star_2.
