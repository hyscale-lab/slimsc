Okay, so I've got this question about a Lagrangian in quantum field theory and whether the theory is renormalizable. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The Lagrangian given is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. Wait, σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν], right? Oh yeah, that's the antisymmetric product of gamma matrices. F^{μν} is the field strength tensor for a gauge field, probably electromagnetism since that's the usual F.

So first, I need to find the mass dimension of κ. Remember, in 4-dimensional spacetime (which is standard for these calculations), each field has a certain mass dimension, and the terms in the Lagrangian must be dimensionless because the action is dimensionless. The Lagrangian density itself has mass dimension 4 because the action is the integral of L (which is dimensionless) so [L] = 4.

Wait, no, wait. Wait. The Lagrangian density has mass dimension 4? Let me think. The action S is dimensionless. The integral is over four-dimensional spacetime, so the Lagrangian density must have dimension [Mass]^4, because integrating d^4x (which has dimension [Mass}^{-4}) requires that the integrand has [Mass]^4 to give a dimensionless S. So yes, [L] = 4.

So each term in the Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4. So for L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}, the product of the fields and κ must be dimension 4.

Let's break down each field's mass dimension.

The Dirac field ψ has a mass dimension of 3/2. Because for a Dirac spinor, the equation is (iγ^μ ∂_μ - m)ψ = 0. The derivative ∂_μ has mass dimension 1. So each ψ must have [ψ] = 3/2 - since the terms in the equation must balance. So ψ̄ (which is ψ† γ^0) has the same dimension as ψ, 3/2.

What about F^{μν}? F is the field strength tensor. For electromagnetism, F_{μν} = ∂_μ A_ν - ∂_ν A_μ. So each A has dimension 1, because the derivative is dimension 1, so [A] = 1. Then F, being the derivative of A, has [F] = 2. Because each derivative adds 1, and since F is two derivatives acting on A (each term is ∂ A), so F is [∂][A] = 1 + 1 = 2.

Now, σ_{μν} is (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]. The gamma matrices are dimensionless because they're just matrices, not fields. So σ_{μν} is a product of gamma matrices, but does that affect the dimension? Since gamma matrices are dimensionless, σ_{μν} is also dimensionless. So the term ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ is [ψ̄][σ][ψ] = (3/2) * (0) * (3/2) = 3/2 +3/2 = 3. Wait no, [σ] is zero, so the product is 3/2 +3/2 = 3.

Wait wait, no. The product ψ̄ σ ψ is a scalar, so it's a product of ψ̄ and ψ, each with dimension 3/2. So the product would be 3/2 * 2 = 3. Because ψ̄ and ψ each are 3/2, so together 3.

So the term ψ̄ σ ψ has [mass]^3. Then multiplied by F^{μν}, which is [mass]^2. So the entire term is κ * [ψ̄ σ ψ] * [F] = κ * (3) * (2) = κ * [mass]^5.

Wait, wait, no. Let me re-examine: ψ̄ σ ψ is dimension [ψ̄] + [σ] + [ψ] = 3/2 +0 +3/2 =3. Then F^{μν} is dimension 2. So the product of these is 3 +2 =5. So the entire term is κ multiplied by 5? No, because the term is κ multiplied by (ψ̄ σ ψ F). So [κ] * [ψ̄ σ ψ] * [F] = [κ] * 3 * 2 = [κ]*6.

Because the Lagrangian term must have dimension 4, so [κ] * 6 =4. So [κ] must be 4/6 = 2/3? Wait, that can't be right because the options don't show that. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the breakdown.

Wait, wait, let's double-check. The term is κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}.

The dimensions: [ψ̄] = 3/2, [σ] = 0, [ψ] =3/2. So ψ̄ σ ψ is (3/2 +3/2) =3.

F^{μν} is field strength tensor, [F] = 2.

So the product [ψ̄ σ ψ F] is 3 + 2 =5. So the term κ multiplied by this must have dimension 4. So [κ] * 5 =4 → [κ] =4/5? Hmm, but none of the options suggest that. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, wait. Wait, the term is ψ̄ σ μν ψ F^{μν}.

Wait, the structure is a product of ψ̄, σ, ψ, and F. So each of these contributes their dimensions.

Wait, perhaps I should consider each field's dimension:

Each ψ is 3/2, so ψ̄ is 3/2, σ is dimensionless (gamma matrices are dim 0), and F is dimension 2.

So [ψ̄ σ ψ F] = (3/2) + (3/2) + 2 = 8/2 =4? Wait, that adds up to 3/2 +3/2 is 3, plus 2 is 5. Oh wait, no, I think I'm adding the dimensions, which is correct.

So [ψ̄ σ ψ F] = 3 + 2 =5.

But the Lagrangian term has dimension 4. So:

[κ] *5 =4 → [κ] =4/5. Hmm, but the options don't have 4/5. So perhaps I made a mistake in the dimensions somewhere.

Wait, wait another thing. The sigma term: σ_{μν} is antisymmetric and is a product of gamma matrices. But perhaps it's treated as a tensor with some dimension? No, because gamma matrices are just matrices, so they don't contribute to mass dimension. So σ_{μν} is still dimensionless.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the dimension of F. Let me think again. The field strength F is ∂μ Aν - ∂ν Aμ. So each A has dimension 1. The derivative is dimension 1, so each term in F is [∂][A] =1 +1=2. So F has dimension 2. That's correct.

Hmm, but wait, maybe the issue is that the term is ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}, which is a Lorentz scalar. But perhaps I should think about the Lorentz indices.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that I'm not considering the contraction correctly. Because the term is F^{μν}, which is antisymmetric in μν, and σ_{μν} is also antisymmetric. So when we contract, does that affect the dimension?

Wait, no. The contraction doesn't change the mass dimension, just the fact that it's a scalar. So the term σ_{μν} F^{μν} is a Lorentz scalar, but the dimensions are the same as the product of σ and F.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Let me think about the structure of the term.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think about the term as ψ̄ (σ F) ψ. So [ψ̄] =3/2, [σ F] would have dimensions [σ] + [F] =0 +2=2, and [ψ] is 3/2. So the product is 3/2 +2 +3/2 = 3/2 *2 +2 =3 +2=5. So same as before.

Wait, but the Lagrangian term is [κ][ψ̄ σ ψ F] = [κ] *5 =4 → [κ] is 4/5, which is 0.8. But the options don't have 4/5. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I got the dimension of F wrong. Maybe F has dimension 1? No, that can't be. Because A has dimension 1, and F is ∂μ Aν → so each term is [∂][A] =1 +1=2. So F is 2.

Hmm, maybe I messed up the dimensions of the fields. Let me check again.

In 4D spacetime, the fields:

- Spinor ψ: dimension 3/2. Because the Dirac equation is (iγ^μ ∂_μ - m)ψ =0. The ∂ has dim 1, m has dim 1, so each term must balance. So ψ must have (1) from ∂, and mass term mψ must have dimension 1. So ψ has 1/2, but wait no. Wait, the term (iγ ∂ ψ) is (∂ acting on ψ), so (1) * [ψ] = dimension of the term. The mass term is m ψ, which must have same dimension as (iγ ∂ ψ). So [m ψ] = [∂ ψ] → [m] + [ψ] = [∂] + [ψ] → [m] = [∂], which is 1. So [ψ] is [m] - [∂ ] + something? No, wait. Let me think. The equation is (iγ^μ ∂_μ ψ) = m ψ. So both terms must have the same dimension. So [γ^μ ∂_μ ψ] = [ψ]. Wait, but ∂_μ has dimension 1, and ψ is [ψ]. So the left side is [∂][ψ] = 1 + [ψ]. The right side is [m][ψ]. So 1 + [ψ] = [m] + [ψ] → [m] =1. So [m] is 1. So [ψ] is (from the right side) [m ψ] = 1 + [ψ]. Wait, no, the equation is (iγ ∂ ψ) = m ψ. So each side must have the same dimension. So [iγ ∂ ψ] = [m ψ].

The left side is [γ] (dimensionless) * [∂] * [ψ] → 1 *1 * [ψ] = [ψ]. The right side is [m] [ψ] → 1 * [ψ]. So both sides are equal, which doesn't give me [ψ]. Hmm, that approach doesn't help. Another way: The action has dimension 0. The Dirac Lagrangian is L = i ψ̄ γ^μ ∂_μ ψ - m ψ̄ ψ. Each term must have dimension 4. So [ψ̄ γ ∂ ψ ] =4. [ψ̄] = a, [γ] =0, [∂] =1, [ψ]=a. So a *1 * a = a² → [term] is a² =4 → a=2. But wait, a was [ψ̄], which is same as [ψ], so [ψ] =2? No, that can't be right because ψ is a spinor, and in 4D, usual dimensions are [ψ] =3/2.

Wait, perhaps I should recall that in 4 dimensions, the fields have the following dimensions:

- Scalar: 1
- Spinor: 3/2
- Vector (like Aμ): 1

Because the action is dimensionless, and the integral is d^4x (dimension -4), so each Lagrangian term must have dimension 4.

So for a term like ∂μ Aν, [∂] is 1, [A] is 1 → [∂ A] is 2.

So the term F^{μν} has dimension 2.

So going back, in the given L_int, the term is κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}.

Breaking down dimensions:

[ψ̄] =3/2, [σ] =0, [ψ]=3/2, [F]=2.

So [ψ̄ σ ψ] =3/2 +3/2 =3. [F] is 2. So [ψ̄ σ ψ F] =3 +2=5.

So [κ] *5 =4 → [κ]=4/5. Wait, but looking at the options, there's no 4/5. So something's wrong.

Wait, perhaps I miscounted the dimensions. Let me think again. Oh wait, no, perhaps the term is F^{μν}, which is (field strength), which is a tensor with two indices, so dimension 2.

Wait, but the term is a product of F and the spinor terms, which together make 3 +2=5. So [κ] *5 =4 → [κ] =4/5. But none of the options have 4/5. So perhaps I made a mistake in the dimension of σ_{μν}?

Wait, σ_{μν} is (i/2)[γμ, γν], which is an antisymmetric tensor. But because it's made from γ matrices, which are dimensionless, σ_{μν} is dimensionless. So that part is correct.

Hmm, maybe I got the dimensions wrong because of the structure. Maybe the term is a product of four objects: two ψ̄, two ψ, and F, but no, that's not the case. Wait, it's ψ̄ multiplied by σ, which is itself a product of gamma matrices, but in terms of dimension, σ is still dimensionless.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the number of derivatives or fields. Let me think of the term. The interaction term is ψ̄ σ F ψ. So each ψ is 3/2, each F is 2, so the product is 3/2 +3/2 +2 = 3 +2=5. So yes, same as before.

Hmm, this is confusing because none of the options match. Wait, perhaps the question is about the term's dimension, but maybe I should think about the theory's renormalizability.

Wait, the mass dimension of the coupling constant κ determines whether the interaction is renormalizable. In 4D, a coupling is renormalizable if its dimension [κ] ≥ 0. Wait, no, wait. The general rule is that a coupling is renormalizable if [κ] ≥ - (number of spacetime dimensions)/2. Or wait, another approach: The interaction term must have a dimension ≤4 because the Lagrangian is dimension 4. So for a term like ψ^m (some tensor) ψ^n, the coupling's dimension would adjust accordingly. But in this case, the term is dimension 5, which would require the coupling to have [κ]=4/5.

Wait, but 4/5 is positive, so [κ]=0.8, which is positive. But in 4D, for renormalizability, the dimension of the coupling [κ] must be ≥ (4 - (sum of fields' dimensions)). Wait, no, perhaps I should think in terms of superficial degree of divergence.

Wait, the superficial degree of divergence D is given by D=4 - (n_p), where n_p is the number of propagators. Wait, but that's for Feynman diagrams. Alternatively, for a term to be renormalizable, the coupling must have a mass dimension ≥0. Because in 4D, the coupling's dimension must be ≥0. So if [κ]=4/5, which is positive, the theory would be renormalizable. But none of the options have 4/5.

Wait a minute, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of [κ]. Let me think again. The term is κ ψ̄ σ ψ F. So the Lagrangian term must have dimension 4. So [κ][ψ̄][σ][ψ][F] =4.

Wait, no, [σ] is dimensionless. So [κ] * [ψ̄][ψ][F] =4.

So [ψ̄] is3/2, [ψ] is3/2, [F] is2. So 3/2 +3/2 +2 =3 +2=5. So [κ] *5=4 → [κ]=4/5. But the options don't have 4/5. So perhaps I'm making a mistake in the field dimensions.

Wait, wait another approach: Let me think about the dimension of each field again.

The Dirac field ψ has dimension 3/2 in 4D. Because the action has to be dimensionless. The kinetic term for ψ is i ψ̄ γ^μ ∂_μ ψ, which must have dimension 4. So [ψ̄][γ][∂][ψ] =4. [γ] is dimensionless, [∂] is 1. So [ψ̄][ψ] =4 → [ψ] = (4)/( [ψ̄][∂] ) → Wait, [ψ̄][ψ] = (3/2) * (3/2) =9/4? No, I'm getting confused.

Another approach: The dimension of ψ is d. Then, the term i ψ̄ γ^μ ∂_μ ψ must have dimension 4. So [ψ̄] is d, [∂] is 1, [ψ] is d. So d *1 *d = d² → d²=4 → d=2. But wait, that can't be right because a Dirac spinor's dimension is 3/2. So this must be wrong. So perhaps I'm making a mistake here.

Wait, I think I remember that in 4D, the Dirac field has mass dimension 3/2. So [ψ] =3/2. Let me take that as given.

So [ψ̄] =3/2, [σ]=0, [F] =2.

So [ψ̄ σ ψ F] =3/2 +3/2 +2 =3+2=5.

So [κ] *5=4 → [κ]=4/5.

But the options don't have 4/5. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the term is F_{μν} instead of F^{μν}? No, that doesn't affect the dimension. Because F is either covariant or contravariant, but the dimension is the same.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscounting the dimensions because of Lorentz indices. But I don't think that affects the mass dimension.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the structure of the term. Let me think again: the term is ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}.

So how many terms are in the product? It's ψ̄ (σ ψ) F. No, it's ψ̄ σ ψ F. So it's four fields: two ψ's, one ψ̄, and one F.

Wait, no: ψ̄ is one field, ψ is another, F is a third. σ is a tensor made from gammas, so it's not a separate field. So the term is ψ̄ multiplied by σ, which is a tensor, then ψ, then F.

So the dimensions are [ψ̄] + [ψ] + [F] =3/2 +3/2 +2=3+2=5. So [κ] *5=4 → [κ]=4/5.

But since the options don't have this, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the Lorentz indices and I missed that.

Wait, another thought: The term has two Lorentz indices from σ_{μν} and two from F^{μν}, so when contracted, perhaps there's an overall symmetric factor that affects the dimension. But I don't think that's the case because Lorentz indices don't contribute to mass dimension.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the definition of the Lagrangian. Let me recheck the problem statement.

The given Lagrangian is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. So σ_{μν} is (i/2)[γμ, γν], which is antisymmetric, and F^{μν} is the field strength.

Wait, perhaps F^{μν} is actually the dual tensor or something else, but no, it's the usual field strength.

Hmm, I'm stuck because none of the options match [κ]=4/5. So perhaps I made a wrong assumption earlier.

Wait, let me think about the possible options. The options are:

A) [κ]=-1, renormalizable.

B) [κ]=1, renormalizable.

C) [κ]=-1, not ren.

D) [κ]=1, not ren.

So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation and the correct [κ] is -1. How?

Wait, perhaps I should recheck the dimensions of the fields. Suppose I take [ψ] = 3/2, [F]=2.

Then [ψ̄ σ ψ F] = (3/2) + (3/2) + 2 =3 +2=5.

Alternatively, perhaps the term is written as ψ̄ σ^{μν} ψ F_{μν}, but that doesn't change anything.

Wait, perhaps the term is F^{μν} which is a 2-form, but that doesn't change the dimension.

Alternatively, perhaps the term is actually F_{μν} instead of F^{mu nu}, but that wouldn't change the dimension.

Wait, another angle: Maybe I should think about the term in terms of the number of fields. The interaction term must have four fields to make dimension 4. But the given term has ψ̄, ψ, and F. That's three fields. Oh wait, F is a two-index tensor, so perhaps it's equivalent to having two A fields? Hmm, maybe not. Let me think about it.

Wait, F is a derived field, but it's made from A. So perhaps when considering the dimension, it's the same as considering A fields. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the term is actually written such that F_{μν} is treated as two A fields. Because F is the field strength, which is the derivative of A.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to think of the term as having four fields contributing.

Wait, the term is ψ̄ σ ψ F. So that's two ψ's, one ψ̄, and one F. So four fields in total? No, F is a tensor, but in terms of fields, it's one tensor field. So perhaps the total dimension is 3/2 (ψ̄) +3/2 (ψ) +2 (F) = 3 +2=5. So [κ]=4/5.

But again, that's not in the options. So perhaps I'm making a mistake elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps the term is written with an implicit sum or has more fields. Alternatively, perhaps the term is of the form ψ̄ σ F ψ, which would be the same as ψ̄ σ ψ F.

Hmm. I'm a bit stuck, but perhaps I should proceed with the options.

Looking back, the options for [κ] are -1 or 1. So perhaps I'm missing something. Let me try to think differently.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the number of derivatives. Because sometimes terms like this involve derivatives of fields. For example, in some interactions, you might have terms like ∂ψ, which adds a derivative (dimension 1) to ψ's dimension.

Wait, but in this term, the interaction is ψ̄ σ ψ F. No derivatives on ψ here. So the dimension calculation I did earlier should hold.

Wait, another thought: Perhaps F^{mu nu} has dimension 1, not 2. Because A has dimension 1, F is ∂A, so [F] =1+1=2. So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the term's dimension in a different way. Let me think about the possible maximum dimension that allows renormalizability.

In 4D, a term is renormalizable if the coupling has [κ] ≥0. Because each loop introduces factors of the coupling, and if [κ] is negative, you get more divergences.

In this case, [κ] is 4/5, which is positive. So the theory would be renormalizable. But looking at the options, the only options with [κ] positive are B and D.

Option B: [κ]=1, renormalizable.

Option D: [κ]=1, not ren.

So if [κ] is 4/5, which is about 0.8, which is positive. So the theory is renormalizable, which would make option B incorrect because it's [κ]=1. So perhaps the correct answer is not here. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the initial assumption about the dimension is wrong. Let me think again. Perhaps the term is considering the contraction of indices, but the dimension remains the same.

Wait, perhaps the term is written as ψ̄ σ^{μν} ψ F_{μν}, which involves two Lorentz indices. But that doesn't affect the mass dimension.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the term as involving two F terms. No, the term has F to the first power.

Wait, perhaps F has a different dimension. Let me think again. A gauge field A has dimension 1. The field strength F is ∂μ Aν - ∂ν Aμ. So each term is [∂][A] =1+1=2. So F has dimension 2. So that's correct.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the fact that this interaction term is dimension 5, which would require the coupling to have dimension -1 to make the term dimension 4. Because 5 + (-1) =4 → [κ]=-1.

Wait, wait! Oh! Wait a second, I think I made a mistake in the calculation earlier. Because the term is κ * ψ̄ σ ψ F. The product ψ̄ σ ψ F has dimension 3/2 +3/2 +2 =3 +2=5. So the term is κ multiplied by 5. So for the term to be dimension 4, [κ] *5 =4 → [κ]=4/5.

But wait, maybe I should think of the term as a product of fields, each of which has their own dimension. So [κ] + [ψ̄] + [σ] + [ψ] + [F] =4.

Wait no, because [σ] is zero. So [κ] +3/2 +3/2 +2 =4 → [κ] +3 +2 =4 → [κ]=4-5= -1.

Ah! Wait, that makes sense. Because each term in the Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4. So the sum of the dimensions of all the factors (including κ) must be 4.

So [κ] + [ψ̄] + [σ] + [ψ] + [F] =4.

But [σ] is 0, [ψ̄]=3/2, [ψ]=3/2, [F]=2.

So [κ] +3/2 +3/2 +2=4 → [κ] + (3+2)=4 → [κ] +5=4 → [κ]= -1.

Oh! That's it. I see where I went wrong earlier. I thought the product's dimension is 5, so [κ]=4/5, but that's incorrect. Because the term is κ multiplied by ψ̄ σ ψ F, and each of those has their own dimensions. So the sum is [κ] +3/2 +3/2 +2= [κ] +5=4 → [κ]=-1.

Ah, that makes sense now. So [κ]=-1. So the mass dimension is -1.

Now, the second part: is the theory renormalizable? A theory is renormalizable if the coupling constant has positive mass dimension (or dimension ≤4 in 4D). Wait, no, the correct condition is that the coupling's dimension must be ≥0. Because in 4D, a renormalizable interaction must have a coupling with dimension [κ] ≥0. Because if [κ] is negative, the interaction becomes relevant, leading to a non-renormalizable theory.

Wait, no. Wait, in 4D, an interaction term is renormalizable if the coupling has dimension [κ] ≥0. Because a coupling with negative dimension would imply that the interaction term has higher dimension than 4, which would make the theory non-renormalizable.

Wait, no. Wait, let me think: In 4D, the Lagrangian term must have dimension 4. So any term that has dimension higher than 4 would require the coupling to have negative dimension to compensate. But such terms are non-renormalizable because they lead to higher-order divergences.

So in this case, the coupling has [κ]=-1, which means the term has dimension [κ] +5 =4, which is correct. But [κ]=-1 is negative. So the interaction is non-renormalizable because the coupling has a negative mass dimension.

So the theory is not renormalizable.

So the answer would be option C: [κ]=-1, not renormalizable.

Looking back at the options:

Option C) [κ]=-1, not renormalizable.

Yes.

To determine the mass dimension of the coupling constant \( \kappa \) and whether the theory is renormalizable, we analyze the given Lagrangian:

\[
\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}} = \kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu},
\]
where \( \sigma_{\mu\nu} = \frac{i}{2}[\gamma_\mu, \gamma_\nu] \), \( F^{\mu\nu} \) is the field strength tensor, and \( \bar{\psi} \) is the Dirac adjoint of the spinor field \( \psi \).

### Step 1: Mass dimensions of the fields
In 4-dimensional spacetime:
- The Dirac spinor \( \psi \) has mass dimension \( [\psi] = \frac{3}{2} \).
- The field strength tensor \( F^{\mu\nu} \) has mass dimension \( [F^{\mu\nu}] = 2 \), as it is derived from the gauge field \( A_\mu \) with \( [A_\mu] = 1 \) and involves derivatives \( [\partial_\mu] = 1 \).
- The tensor \( \sigma_{\mu\nu} \), being a product of dimensionless gamma matrices \( \gamma_\mu \), is also dimensionless: \( [\sigma_{\mu\nu}] = 0 \).

### Step 2: Mass dimension of \( \kappa \)
The Lagrangian density must have mass dimension 4 in 4D spacetime. The term \( \kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu} \) contributes to the Lagrangian, so the product of the dimensions of its components must equal 4:
\[
[\kappa] + [\bar{\psi}] + [\sigma_{\mu\nu}] + [\psi] + [F^{\mu\nu}] = 4.
\]
Substituting the known dimensions:
\[
[\kappa] + \frac{3}{2} + 0 + \frac{3}{2} + 2 = 4.
\]
Simplifying:
\[
[\kappa] + 5 = 4 \implies [\kappa] = -1.
\]

### Step 3: Renormalizability of the theory
A theory is renormalizable if the coupling constants have non-negative mass dimensions. In this case, \( [\kappa] = -1 \), which is negative. This indicates that the interaction term has a higher dimension than 4, making the theory non-renormalizable.

### Final Answer
The mass dimension of \( \kappa \) is \( -1 \), and the theory is not renormalizable.
