Okay, so I have this question about symmetries in the SMEFT. Hmm, SMEFT stands for Standard Model Effective Field Theory, right? I remember that effective theories are used when you have some high-energy physics that you can't see directly, so you write down all possible interactions up to a certain energy scale.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT. Let me think about each symmetry one by one.

First, Lorentz symmetry. I think that's a big one. The Standard Model is Lorentz-invariant, so SMEFT, being an effective theory built from the SM, should also respect Lorentz symmetry. So all operators must be Lorentz scalars, meaning any operator added must transform in a way that's consistent with Lorentz transformations. So yeah, Lorentz symmetry is a must.

Next, Poincare symmetry. Wait, isn't Poincare symmetry a broader symmetry that includes Lorentz and translations? So if the theory already respects Lorentz, does it automatically respect Poincare? I think so because Poincare includes both Lorentz transformations and translations. But wait, SMEFT is a field theory, so it's formulated in a way that respects Poincare. So operators should respect Poincare symmetry. So both Lorentz and Poincare are required.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Does SMEFT require Poincare symmetry beyond Lorentz? Because Poincare includes momentum conservation via translations. I think all the operators in SMEFT must be Poincare-invariant. So yes, both 1 and 2 are correct.

Now, CP symmetry. I remember that the SM isn't CP symmetric. For example, CP violation is observed in the kaon system. So, in the SM, not all interactions are CP invariant. So if SMEFT is built from the SM, does it have to respect CP? Or can operators violate CP?

Wait, SMEFT itself is CP-invariant? Or is it that the SM is the low-energy limit, and SMEFT can have higher-dimensional operators that may or may not respect CP?

Wait, I think that in the SMEFT framework, the operators are constructed such that they respect the same global symmetries as the SM. So if the SM doesn't have a certain symmetry, like CP, then SMEFT operators can violate that as well. But no, wait, the operators are built from SM fields, so their CP properties depend on the fields and their interactions.

Hmm, maybe the operators must respect the same symmetries as the SM. Since the SM isn't CP symmetric, the SMEFT operators can have CP violation. So not all operators respect CP symmetry. Therefore, option 3 is not a must. So the answer doesn't include 3.

What about CPT symmetry? I think the SM is CPT symmetric. Because CPT is a fundamental symmetry in quantum field theory. So any theory built from the SM, like SMEFT, should respect CPT symmetry. Therefore, all operators must respect CPT. So option 4 is correct.

Putting it all together:

1. Lorentz: must be respected.

2. Poincare: must be respected.

3. CP: not necessarily.

4. CPT: must be respected.

Wait, but wait a second. The question is about which symmetries MUST be respected by all operators. So SMEFT operators must be Poincare and Lorentz invariant, and CPT invariant. But do they have to be CP invariant?

No, because the SM already has CP violation, so SMEFT can include operators that violate CP. So operators might not respect CP symmetry. So 3 is not a must.

So the symmetries that must be respected are Lorentz, Poincare, and CPT.

Looking at the options:

Option C: 1,2,4 → That's Lorentz, Poincare, CPT.

Option D: 1,3,4 → No, since 3 is not a must.

Wait, but wait. Does SMEFT require all operators to be CPT symmetric? Because CPT is a fundamental symmetry in quantum field theory. So any term that's added must obey CPT.

But how about the operators themselves? For example, can you have an operator that breaks CPT?

Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on this. Let me think. In quantum field theory, the CPT theorem states that for any Lorentz-invariant theory, CPT is a symmetry. So if the theory is Lorentz-invariant, it must be CPT-invariant. So if all operators respect Lorentz symmetry, they must automatically respect CPT. So the CPT symmetry is a consequence of Lorentz symmetry plus other things.

Wait, but that's a theorem. So if the theory is Lorentz invariant, then it is CPT invariant. So all operators in SMEFT must respect CPT because they respect Lorentz.

Wait, but that might not be the case. Because CPT symmetry can be violated if there's a CPT-odd term. But in a Lorentz-invariant theory, you can't have such terms because the CPT symmetry is a product of other symmetries.

Hmm, maybe I'm getting mixed up. Let me think again. The CPT theorem applies to theories that are Lorentz-invariant and have a unitary S-matrix. So if the SMEFT is Lorentz-invariant, then it's automatically CPT-invariant.

Wait, but in the SMEFT, all operators are Lorentz scalars. So they must be CPT-invariant as well. So any operator that's a Lorentz scalar must be a CPT scalar? Or can it have CPT-odd parts?

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think of an example. Suppose you have a dimension-6 operator like (H† H)². H is a scalar, so the operator is a scalar under Lorentz. What about CPT? H is a complex scalar, but in the SM, it's part of a CPT-even object. So operators constructed from SM fields that are CPT-symmetric would preserve CPT. But could an operator in SMEFT violate CPT?

Wait, I think that in SMEFT, the operators are built to be CPT-invariant. Because the theory is Lorentz-invariant, and thus CPT is a symmetry. So all operators must respect CPT.

Wait, but the question is whether the operators must respect all these symmetries. So 4, CPT, is required.

So, putting it all together, the operators must respect Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincare symmetry (2), and CPT (4). So option C is 1,2,4.

Wait, but option C is A) 1,2; C)1,2,4; D)1,3,4.

So the correct answer would be option C.

But wait, earlier I thought that all operators must respect CPT because of Lorentz symmetry. So yes, all must respect 1,2,4.

But the question is, which of the following symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT.

So the answer should include 1,2,4. So option C.

But wait, earlier I thought that Poincare symmetry is included in Lorentz. Wait, no. Poincare is a larger symmetry group that includes Lorentz and translations. So if a theory respects Poincare, it automatically respects Lorentz. So if all SMEFT operators are Poincare-invariant, then they are also Lorentz-invariant. So the question is whether the operators must respect all of Lorentz, Poincare, and CPT.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. SMEFT must be a Lorentz-invariant theory because it's an effective theory of the SM, which is Lorentz-invariant.

Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz and translations. So if a theory is Poincare-invariant, it's Lorentz-invariant. But why would the question list both 1 and 2 as separate options? Oh, because the question is about which symmetries must be respected. So perhaps both Lorentz and Poincare are required.

Wait, but the two are connected. If the theory respects Poincare, it automatically respects Lorentz. So why would both be required? Or maybe the question lists both because, in SMEFT, each operator must be a Poincare scalar, which implies Lorentz scalar as well.

But the way the question is phrased, it's asking which of these symmetries must be respected. So perhaps all operators must respect Lorentz, Poincare, and CPT, but not necessarily CP.

So, the correct answer would include 1,2,4 → option C.

Wait, but one more check. Does SMEFT allow operators that violate CP? Because the SM itself has CP violation, so in SMEFT, you can have operators that cause more CP violation. So the theory doesn't require operators to respect CP symmetry. So 3 is not a must.

So the answer is C)1,2,4.

The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is an effective theory built from the Standard Model (SM), respecting the same symmetries as the SM at low energies. The question asks which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. Let us analyze each symmetry:

1. **Lorentz Symmetry**: SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory because it is an effective field theory of the SM, which respects Lorentz symmetry. All operators in SMEFT must be Lorentz scalars, meaning they must transform consistently under Lorentz transformations. Thus, Lorentz symmetry is a must.

2. **Poincaré Symmetry**: Poincaré symmetry includes both Lorentz symmetry and translation symmetry. Since SMEFT is formulated as a field theory, it inherently respects Poincaré symmetry. Therefore, all operators in SMEFT must also respect Poincaré symmetry.

3. **CP Symmetry**: The SM is not CP-symmetric, as CP violation is observed in phenomena like kaon oscillations. Since SMEFT is built from the SM, it does not necessarily require all operators to respect CP symmetry. Operators in SMEFT can violate CP symmetry, depending on the interactions they describe. Thus, CP symmetry is not a must.

4. **CPT Symmetry**: The CPT theorem states that any Lorentz-invariant theory with a unitary S-matrix must respect CPT symmetry. Since SMEFT is Lorentz-invariant, it must also respect CPT symmetry. Therefore, all operators in SMEFT must respect CPT symmetry.

From this analysis, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincaré symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4). CP symmetry (3) is not necessarily respected by all operators.

**Correct Answer**: C) 1, 2, 4
