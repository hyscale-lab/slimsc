Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of particle physics. But I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question is about the possible decay channels of a boson X. The given Lagrangian is L(y) = -λ f ψ_f(y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, no, wait, the actual Lagrangian is written as L(y) = -λ f ψ_f(y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, maybe I'm misreading that. Oh wait, perhaps it's written as L = -λ ψ_f (y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y), where ψ_f is a fermion field.

The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. So, the question is about the allowed decays of X at the lowest order, which I think refers to tree-level decays. So, the kinematically allowed decays would depend on the mass of X and the masses of the fermions it can decay into.

Wait, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details. Let me think: for a boson like a scalar (since X is a boson field), its decay products would be fermion-antifermion pairs. The possible decays are determined by the mass of X and the masses of the fermions.

So, the mass of X is 6 GeV. Each decay product pair (like b bbar, etc.) must have a combined mass less than or equal to 6 GeV. So, the rest mass of each fermion must be less than half of 6 GeV, which is 3 GeV. Because each fermion in the pair would have a mass m, and 2m must be ≤ 6 GeV → m ≤3 GeV.

Wait, but wait, no. The rest mass of the fermion would be m. When the boson X decays into a fermion-antifermion pair, each particle would have energy, but their rest masses would require that 2m ≤ m_X. Because the minimum energy needed is when the particles are at rest, so m_X must be ≥ 2m.

So for each fermion species, if its mass is less than or equal to 3 GeV, then the X can decay into that pair.

Now, what are the masses of the fermions in the Standard Model?

Let me list the known fermion masses:

Electron (e): very light, about 0.0005 GeV (negligible compared to 3 GeV)
Muon (μ): ~0.105 GeV
Tau (τ): ~1.78 GeV
Up quark (u): ~2 MeV (<<3 GeV)
Down quark (d): ~4-5 MeV
Strange quark (s): ~95-100 MeV
Charm quark (c): ~1.2-1.5 GeV
Bottom quark (b): ~4.1-4.7 GeV
Top quark (t): ~173 GeV

Wait, but wait. So for each fermion, their mass determines if X can decay into them.

So, let's see which fermions have mass m ≤3 GeV.

Electron: yes, m≈0. So X can decay into e+ e-.

Same for muon: m≈0.1 GeV, which is much less than 3 GeV. So mu+ mu- is allowed.

Tau: m≈1.78 GeV, which is less than 3 GeV. So tau+ tau- allowed.

Quarks:

u: 2 MeV → yes.

d: ~5 MeV → yes.

s: ~100 MeV → yes.

c: ~1.3 GeV → yes, because 1.3 <3.

b: ~4.5 GeV → 4.5 >3 → so 2m would be 9 GeV, which is larger than X's mass of 6 GeV. So X can't decay into b bbar because 2m (b) ≈ 9 GeV, which is larger than X's mass. So b bbar is not allowed.

What about top quark? m_t is about 173 GeV, which is way higher, so no.

So the allowed fermions for decay are:

e, mu, tau, u, d, s, c.

Wait, but wait. The decay would be into a pair. So X → e+ e-, mu+ mu-, tau+ tau-, and the quarks would have to be in pairs as well. But wait, in a decay like X → u ubar, but that would require a quark and antiquark, but in reality, the X is a scalar and the interaction is Yukawa-like. So the interaction term would involve the scalar coupling to the fermions.

Wait, in the given Lagrangian, the interaction term is -λ f ψ_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, no, perhaps I'm misreading. Wait, the Lagrangian is written as:

L(y) = -λ f ψ_f(y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y)

Wait, that seems a bit odd. Or perhaps it's a Yukawa coupling term. So the interaction is λ f ψ_f (v + X) ψ_f, which would be a Yukawa term. So when X couples to the fermion, it would mediate the decay X → ψ_f ψ_f̄.

So, the allowed decay products are fermion-antifermion pairs, where each fermion has mass m ≤ m_X / 2 = 3 GeV.

So, let's list the possible fermions.

Leptons:

- e: m ~ 0 → allowed.

- mu: m ~ 0.105 GeV → allowed.

- tau: m ~ 1.78 GeV → allowed.

Quarks:

u: m ~ 2 MeV → allowed.

d: ~5 MeV → allowed.

s: ~100 MeV → allowed.

c: m ~1.3 GeV → allowed.

b: ~4.5 GeV → 2m = 9 GeV >6 GeV → not allowed.

t: way too heavy.

So the possible decay channels are into any of these fermion pairs.

So X can decay into:

e+ e-

mu+ mu-

tau+ tau-

u u-bar

d d-bar

s s-bar

c c-bar.

Wait, but looking at the options:

Option A: X→ b bbar, s, u, d, tau, e, e+ etc. Wait, no: option A says X→ b bbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau-, e+ e-.

But wait, earlier I concluded that b bbar is not allowed because 2m_b is 9 GeV, which is bigger than 6 GeV. So option A includes b bbar, which is not allowed. So option A is incorrect.

Option B: c cbar, s, u, d, tau+, mu, e. So it includes c, which is allowed (m_c ~1.3 GeV), which is less than 3 GeV. So X can decay into c cbar. So option B includes c, which is allowed.

Option C: includes c, s, u, d, t, tau, mu, e. But wait, t quark's mass is 173 GeV, which is way above 3 GeV. So X can't decay into t tbar. So option C is incorrect.

Option D: includes b, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. But again, b's mass is too high. So option D is incorrect.

Wait, let me check each option.

Option A: Includes b bbar. Not allowed. So A is wrong.

Option B: Includes c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-. All these fermions have masses less than or equal to 3 GeV. So this is a possible option.

Option C: Includes t tbar. Not allowed. So C is wrong.

Option D: Includes b bbar. Not allowed. So D is wrong.

So the correct answer is option B.

Wait, but looking at the options again, option B is: X → c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

Yes, all these fermions have m ≤3 GeV.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check the masses. For the c quark, the mass is about 1.27 GeV (average of 1.2 and 1.5?), which is less than 3 GeV. So yes, allowed.

Tau is about 1.78 GeV, which is less than 3 GeV. So allowed.

What about the muon: 0.105 GeV, allowed. Electron: 0.0005 GeV, allowed.

The quarks u, d, s: all way below 3 GeV.

So all of these are allowed. So the decay channels are as listed in option B.

Wait, but wait. What about the bottom quark? Oh right, I thought that for option B, the decay into b bbar is not present. So the allowed decays are into the lighter fermions, not the heavier ones.

So option B is the correct choice.

The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decays of a boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV. The decays depend on the fermion masses, as the combined mass of the decay products must not exceed the mass of \( X \). Specifically, for a decay \( X \to \psi \bar{\psi} \), the fermion mass \( m_\psi \) must satisfy \( 2m_\psi \leq m_X \), or \( m_\psi \leq 3 \, \text{GeV} \).

### Fermion Masses in the Standard Model:
- **Electron (\( e \))**: \( m_e \approx 0.0005 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed)
- **Muon (\( \mu \))**: \( m_\mu \approx 0.105 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed)
- **Tau (\( \tau \))**: \( m_\tau \approx 1.78 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed)
- **Up quark (\( u \))**: \( m_u \approx 2 \, \text{MeV} \) (allowed)
- **Down quark (\( d \))**: \( m_d \approx 4-5 \, \text{MeV} \) (allowed)
- **Strange quark (\( s \))**: \( m_s \approx 95-100 \, \text{MeV} \) (allowed)
- **Charm quark (\( c \))**: \( m_c \approx 1.2-1.5 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed)
- **Bottom quark (\( b \))**: \( m_b \approx 4.1-4.7 \, \text{GeV} \) (not allowed, \( 2m_b > 6 \, \text{GeV} \))
- **Top quark (\( t \))**: \( m_t \approx 173 \, \text{GeV} \) (not allowed, \( 2m_t \gg 6 \, \text{GeV} \))

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed because \( 2m_b > 6 \, \text{GeV} \). **Incorrect**.
- **Option B**: Includes \( c \bar{c} \), \( s \bar{s} \), \( u \bar{u} \), \( d \bar{d} \), \( \tau^+ \tau^- \), \( \mu^+ \mu^- \), and \( e^+ e^- \). All these fermions have \( m_\psi \leq 3 \, \text{GeV} \), so all decays are allowed. **Correct**.
- **Option C**: Includes \( t \bar{t} \), which is not allowed because \( 2m_t \gg 6 \, \text{GeV} \). **Incorrect**.
- **Option D**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed because \( 2m_b > 6 \, \text{GeV} \). **Incorrect**.

### Conclusion:
The kinematically allowed decays of \( X \) are \( X \to c \bar{c}, s \bar{s}, u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, \tau^+ \tau^-, \mu^+ \mu^-, e^+ e^- \), as listed in **Option B**.
