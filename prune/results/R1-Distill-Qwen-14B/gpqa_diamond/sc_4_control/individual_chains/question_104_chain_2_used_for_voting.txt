Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, I remember that the RV method measures the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravitational pull. The bigger the shift, the more massive the planet, or the closer it is, right?

Wait, the problem says both stars have the same mass as the Sun, and each has a Neptune-like planet. So the planet masses are similar. But the Doppler shifts are different: 5 milliangstrom for planet 1 and 7 for planet 2. Oh right, the Doppler shift relates to the star's velocity due to the planet's orbit.

I think the formula involves the velocity semi-amplitude, K. K is the maximum velocity of the star in the radial direction. The formula for K is something like K = (v) where v = (G*M_p * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) )^(1/3) ) * (1/( (1 + M_p/M_star)^(2/3) )) ) ), but wait, maybe I'm getting that wrong. Or perhaps a simpler version: K is proportional to (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(1/3)) ), but since M_p is the same for both planets, and M_star is the same (both are solar masses), then K should be the same? But that can't be right because the shifts are different. Oh wait, wait, no—because in the problem, the observed shifts are at the same wavelength. So the actual velocity would affect the observed shift. Oh, but wait, the RV method measures the velocity of the star, so the shift in the spectral line corresponds to the star's velocity. So a bigger shift implies a higher velocity.

Wait, but in the problem, both planets have similar masses to Neptune, same stars. So their semi-major axes would determine the velocities. If the shift is larger, that means K is larger. So K is higher for planet 2 (7 ma) than planet 1 (5 ma). So planet 2's star is moving faster.

But how does K relate to the orbital period? Because the question is about the orbital period ratio. Hmm. Let's think about the Kepler's third law. The period of the planet's orbit depends on the semi-major axis and the mass of the star. For a star of mass M (like the Sun), the period P is given by P² = (4π²/G M) a³. So P is proportional to a^(3/2) / sqrt(M). Since both stars have the same mass, M is same, so P is proportional to a^(3/2).

But how do we get a from the velocity data? The velocity semi-amplitude K is related to the planet's orbit. The formula I think is K = (v) = (2π G)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3) )) ) * (1/( (1 - e²)^(1/2) )) ). But assuming circular orbits (e=0), so that term is 1. And since M_p << M_star (Neptune is much less than Sun), 1 + M_p/M_star ≈ 1. So K ≈ (2π G)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3)).

Wait, but since both M_p and M_star are the same for both planets, then K should be the same for both, but in the problem, K is different. Oh wait, no, because the problem says they detected a shift of 5 and 7 milliangstrom. So K is different. So maybe I'm missing a factor. Alternatively, perhaps the observed shift relates to the velocity via the Doppler formula.

Wait, the Doppler shift formula is approximately Δλ/λ ≈ v/c, where v is the velocity. So the shift is proportional to velocity. So if planet 1 causes a shift of 5 ma and planet 2 causes 7 ma, then K2/K1 = 7/5 = 1.4. So K2 is 1.4 times K1.

But wait, K is the semi-amplitude of the star's velocity. So the star's velocity is higher for planet 2. Now, how does K relate to the orbital period?

I remember that K is given by K = (v) = (2π a) / P * (M_p sin i) / (M_star)^(1/3) )^(1/2). Wait, perhaps another approach. Since both planets are around the same mass stars and have the same mass, but different K, perhaps the semi-major axes (a) are different.

Wait, the velocity K is given by K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p) ) )^(1/3) ) * ( 2π / P ) )^(1/3) ). Alternatively, perhaps it's better to approach using the formula:

K = [ (G * M_p * sin i ) / ( (M_star)^(1/3) * (1 + M_p/M_star)^(2/3) ) ) ]^(1/3) * ( 2π / P ) )^(1/3) )

Wait, perhaps I should think about the relation between K, P, and a. From the formula, K is proportional to (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(1/3) (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3) )) * ( (2π/P) )^(1/3) )

Wait, maybe I can find a relation between K and P. Let's see.

Kepler's third law says P² = (4π² G M_star ) a^3. So a^3 = G M_star P²/(4 π²).

The RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = ( (G * M_p ) / ( (M_star + M_p) ) )^(1/3) ) * ( 2 π a sin i ) / P )^(1/3) )

Wait, perhaps better to use the formula K = (v) = [ (G * (M_p) sin i ) / ( (M_star)^(1/3) (1 + M_p/M_star)^(2/3) ) ) ] * (1 / (2 π )) )^(1/3) * (1 / P )^(1/3) )

Hmm, this is getting a bit messy. Maybe a better approach is to use the formula that relates K and P.

Another approach: Let's consider the formula for K.

K is given by:

K = (v) = (2π G)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3) )) ) * (1 / P )^(1/3) )

Wait, maybe not. Let me think in terms of Kepler's third law.

We have Kepler's third law: P² = (4 π² a³) / (G M_star)

So a³ = (G M_star P²) / (4 π² )

And the velocity K is given by:

K = (2 π a) / P * ( M_p sin i ) / ( M_star^(1/3) (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3) ) )

Wait, no. Let me think: the star's velocity K is related to the planet's orbit. The planet's orbital speed is v_p = 2 π a / P, and the star's speed is K = (M_p / M_star) * v_p.

So K = (M_p / M_star) * (2 π a / P )

But from Kepler's third law, a³ = (G M_star P²) / (4 π² )

So a = [ (G M_star P²) / (4 π² ) ]^(1/3 )

Substituting a into K:

K = (M_p / M_star) * (2 π / P ) * [ (G M_star P² / 4 π² ) ]^(1/3 )

Let me compute this step by step.

Let me rewrite a:

a = [ (G M_star P² ) / (4 π² ) ]^(1/3 )

So 2 π a = 2 π [ (G M_star P² ) / (4 π² ) ]^(1/3 )

So K = (M_p / M_star) * [2 π * (G M_star P² / 4 π² )^(1/3) ) ] / P

Simplify this:

K = (M_p / M_star) * (2 π ) / P * [ (G M_star P² / 4 π² ) ]^(1/3 )

Factor out P from the cube root:

[ P² ]^(1/3) = P^(2/3)

So,

K = (M_p / M_star) * (2 π ) * [ G M_star / (4 π² ) ]^(1/3 ) * P^(2/3 - 1 )

Because 1/P is P^(-1), so when multiplied by P^(2/3), it's P^(-1/3).

So putting it together:

K = (M_p / M_star) * (2 π ) * [ (G M_star ) / (4 π² ) ]^(1/3 ) * P^(-1/3 )

Let me factor that:

K = (M_p / M_star) * (2 π ) * (G M_star / (4 π² ))^(1/3) * P^(-1/3 )

But M_p is same for both planets, M_star same for both. So let's see, what's the relation between K and P.

Let me write K proportional to P^(-1/3). Because the other factors are constants (since M_p, M_star are same for both planets).

So K ∝ P^(-1/3 )

Which implies that P ∝ K^(-3) ??? Wait, no: K = constant * P^(-1/3), so rearrange: P = (constant / K)^3

Wait, K = C * P^(-1/3) → P = (C / K )^3 → P ∝ (1/K )^3.

So P is proportional to (1/K )^3.

So the ratio of P2 to P1 is (K1 / K2 )^3.

Because P2 = (C / K2 )^3, P1 = (C / K1 )^3, so P2/P1 = (K1 / K2 )^3.

Wait, let me check:

If K ∝ P^(-1/3), then P ∝ K^(-3). So P2/P1 = (K1/K2)^3.

Because if K2 is larger than K1, then P2 is smaller than P1. So for example, if K2 = 7 and K1=5, then K2 > K1 → P2 < P1.

So P2 = (K1/K2)^3 * P1.

Wait, let's think: Since K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), so when K increases, P decreases.

So the ratio P2/P1 = (K1/K2)^3.

Because K = (constant) * P^(-1/3), so K2 = K1 * (P1/P2)^(1/3).

Wait, maybe I should write the ratio for P2 over P1.

Let me write:

K1 = (C) * (P1)^(-1/3)

K2 = (C) * (P2)^(-1/3)

Divide K2 by K1: (K2/K1) = (P1/P2)^(1/3)

So (K2/K1) = (P1/P2)^(1/3)

Raise both sides to the 3rd power:

(K2/K1)^3 = P1/P2 → P2 = P1 * (K1/K2)^3.

So the ratio P2/P1 = (K1/K2)^3.

In the problem, K1 is 5 ma, K2 is 7 ma.

So P2/P1 = (5/7)^3 ≈ (0.7143)^3 ≈ 0.7143 * 0.7143 = about 0.5102, then * 0.7143 ≈ 0.364.

So P2 is about 0.364 times P1. So P2 is about 0.36 times longer than P1? Wait, no, wait. Wait, P2 is 0.36 times P1, so how much longer is P2 than P1? It's shorter, so the ratio is less than 1. But the question is: How many times longer is the orbital period of planet #2 than planet #1.

Wait, the question is: How many times longer is P2 than P1. So if P2 is 0.36 times P1, then P2 is shorter than P1. So the ratio is 0.36, which means it's about 0.36 times as long. So the answer would be option A) ~0.36.

But let me double-check the math:

(5/7) is approximately 0.7142857.

(0.7142857)^3 = ?

0.7142857 * 0.7142857 = 0.51020408.

0.51020408 * 0.7142857 ≈ 0.364.

So yes, about 0.364, which is roughly 0.36.

So the answer is A) ~0.36.

Wait, but let me think again. Because I think I might have mixed up the ratio.

Wait, K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So P is inversely proportional to K^(3). So higher K → shorter period.

Since planet #2 has a higher K (7 ma vs 5 ma), it has a shorter period. So the period of planet #2 is shorter than that of planet #1. So the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1? It's shorter, so the factor is less than 1.

So P2 is (5/7)^3 times P1. So (5/7)^3 ≈ 0.364. So P2 is approximately 0.36 times P1, which is about 36% of P1. So the period of planet #2 is 0.36 times the period of planet #1. So planet #2's period is shorter, so it's about 0.36 times as long as planet #1's. So the answer is A) ~0.36.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1, we analyze the relationship between the radial velocity semi-amplitude \( K \) and the orbital period \( P \). The radial velocity semi-amplitude \( K \) is inversely proportional to \( P^{1/3} \), which can be expressed as:

\[
K \propto P^{-1/3}
\]

This implies that the orbital period \( P \) is proportional to \( K^{-3} \). Therefore, the ratio of the orbital periods \( P_2 / P_1 \) can be expressed as:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left( \frac{K_1}{K_2} \right)^3
\]

From the problem, the radial velocity shifts for planet #1 and planet #2 are 5 milliangstroms (\( K_1 = 5 \)) and 7 milliangstroms (\( K_2 = 7 \)), respectively. Substituting these values:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left( \frac{5}{7} \right)^3
\]

First, calculate \( \frac{5}{7} \):

\[
\frac{5}{7} \approx 0.7143
\]

Next, raise this value to the power of 3:

\[
\left( 0.7143 \right)^3 \approx 0.7143 \times 0.7143 \times 0.7143 \approx 0.364
\]

Thus, the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times the orbital period of planet #1. This means planet #2's orbital period is shorter than planet #1's by a factor of 0.36.

The correct answer is:
