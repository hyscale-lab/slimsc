Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these spectroscopy questions. But let's take it step by step.

Alright, the question says that the compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. So, it's like a benzene ring with two substituents. The FTIR shows an ester group. Esters have a carbonyl group, so the IR peak around 1700 cm^-1 would indicate that. So the molecule contains an ester functional group.

Looking at the 1H NMR spectrum, there are six signals. Let's break down each part. The first two signals are aromatic-H. Since it's a di-substituted benzene, the substituents could be in various positions. The number of signals for aromatic protons depends on the substitution pattern. For example, para substitution would give two sets of equivalent protons. But wait, the question says two signals, so maybe it's a meta or ortho substitution? Or maybe the substituents are such that the aromatic protons split into two distinct sets.

Next, there are two signals for vinyl-H. One is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets. Vinyl protons are typically in doublets when adjacent to each other, like in an ethylene group. Wait, if it's a doublet of quartets, that might suggest coupling with more than one neighboring proton. Hmm, maybe it's a part of a conjugated system or a substituent with more than one proton.

Then there are two signals for –CH3 groups. No signals for –CH2, which suggests there are no methylene groups in the molecule. So all the CH3 groups are in environments where they don't have any adjacent CH2 groups. Like maybe they're attached directly to oxygen or something else.

Putting this all together, let's think about possible structures. The compound has an aromatic ring with two substituents. One of them is an ester group. Since it's an ester, it's likely of the form R-O-CO-O-R', but wait, no, esters are usually R-O-CO-R'. So maybe one substituent is an ester group like O-CO-O-R or something else.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the substituent is an ester group attached via an oxygen. Like O-CO-R. So the other substituent could be something else, but let's see.

The NMR has two aromatic signals. Let's think about substitution patterns. If the substituents are in the para positions, the aromatic protons would be equivalent, giving a single peak. But here, two signals, so maybe ortho or meta. Alternatively, maybe one substituent is an ester and the other is something else, leading to different environments for the aromatic protons.

Wait, the ester group would be a strong substituent, affecting the ring's electron density. So, perhaps the substituents are an ester and another group that's not an electron-donating or withdrawing group.

The vinyl protons: if there are vinyl protons, maybe the substituent has a double bond. So, perhaps one substituent is an ester group and the other is a vinyl group connected to something. Let's think of an example. Maybe one substituent is an ester (like O-CO-R) and the other is a CH2CH3 group? Or maybe it's a propenoate ester or something with a double bond.

Wait, the vinyl H's—so the protons are on a double bond. Could it be part of an ester substituent? Like maybe the substituent is an allyl group or part of a larger substituent with a double bond.

Wait, the ester group is O-CO-O-R. Or actually, wait, the ester is an acyloxy group: R-O-CO-R'. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is an ester as the group attached to the ring.

Wait, let's try to construct the molecule:

The benzene ring has two substituents. One is an ester group (O-CO-O-R or O-CO-R?), and the other substituent might have vinyl protons.

Wait, another approach: since the molecule is a di-substituted benzene, and contains an ester group, perhaps it's something like a benzyl acetate derivative, but with another substituent. Let me think.

Alternatively, maybe one substituent is an ester (like OAc: acetate), and the other is a vinyl group. For example, the ring has an ester group and a vinyl group attached.

Wait, but the vinyl H's in the NMR: one is a doublet and the other a doublet of quartets. That might suggest coupling with two different sets of protons. For example, maybe the vinyl group is part of an ethyl group attached to another group. Hmm.

Wait, let's think about the substituents. The di-substituted benzene has two groups: one is an ester (O-CO-O-R) and the other is a vinyl group (like CH2CH2– but that's ethylene). Or wait, perhaps the substituent is an ester group and another group that's a vinyl ether or something else.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is an ester group where the R is a vinyl group. So the substituent could be O-CO-O-CH2CH2... No, wait, that's getting complicated.

Wait, the vinyl protons: two signals. One is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets. Let me try to imagine what that structure would look like. Maybe it's a CH2=CH group attached to something else. For example, if it's part of a substituent like CH2=CH-O-CO-R, then the vinyl protons would each have different coupling.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl ester. Like, the ester is R-O-CO-CH2CH2–, but that doesn't make much sense. Alternatively, the substituent could be a propenoate ester, such as O-CO-CH2CH2– but that's not right. Maybe the ester's R group is a vinyl group.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is an ester group and the other substituent is a vinyl group attached in a way that creates specific coupling. Let me think about the vinyl protons.

In a simple vinyl group (like CH2=CH–), each proton is a doublet because each is coupled to the other. So two protons, each as a doublet. But in the NMR, they have two signals: one doublet and another doublet of quartets. Wait, that's a bit more complex.

Alternatively, perhaps the vinyl group is part of a larger substituent, like a propene chain. For example, substituent could be CH2–CH2–CO-O-R, but that's more like an ethyl group attached to a carbonyl.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a group where the vinyl protons are split by two sets of neighboring protons. Like, for example, if the substituent is a group where each vinyl proton is adjacent to two different types of protons.

Wait, another possibility: the substituent is a -CH2CH2COOOR group, but that's a longer chain. Hmm. Maybe the substituent is a propyl group or something else.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is an allyl group. The allyl group is CH2CHCH2–, but that's a single substituent. Wait, in that case, the protons on the double bond would be coupled to each other and perhaps to neighboring protons.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a group with a double bond connected to another group. For example, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl group attached to an oxygen, as in O–CH2CH2–COO–R. But I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Let me think about the number of signals in the NMR. There are six signals. Two are aromatic, two vinyl, and two CH3. So, let's see: the aromatic ring has two substituents, so the ring's protons are split into two sets. Maybe the substituents are in such a way that the ring has two distinct sets of equivalent protons. For example, if the substituents are in the para positions, the ring would have two equivalent H's, but that would give one signal. If the substituents are in the meta positions, perhaps the H's are not all equivalent, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, maybe the substituents are in the ortho positions. But that might lead to more complex splitting.

Wait, another approach: the ester group would have a carbonyl, so the molecular formula would include an oxygen from the ester. The molecular formula options are C11H12O2, C11H14O2, C12H12O2, C12H14O2.

So the formula would have (O2) from the ester, perhaps. Now, the ester group is O-CO-O-R. Wait, no, an ester is RCOOR', so the formula for the ester part would be (COOR'), which adds O2 and R' contributes to the rest.

Let me think about the possible structures. The compound has an aromatic ring with two substituents: one is an ester group, and the other substituent has a vinyl group and two CH3 groups.

Wait, no, the NMR shows two CH3 signals. So maybe there are two different methyl groups in the molecule. Like, perhaps the ester is an acetyl group (like an acetate), which would contribute one CH3, and another substituent has another CH3.

Wait, but the substituent on the ring could be something like O-CO-OCH2CH3 (ethyl ester), but that would give a CH2CH3 group, but the NMR shows no CH2 signals. So that might not fit.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is O-CO-OCH(CH3)2. Wait, that's a propyl group with two methyl substituents. Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an ester group where the R group is a methyl. So the substituent is O-CO-OCH3. But that's a methyl ester, so the CH3 would come from the ester.

Wait, but the NMR shows two CH3 groups. So perhaps another CH3 is elsewhere. So the other substituent would have another CH3 group.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a vinyl group attached to a methyl group. Like CH2=CH-O-CO-R. But that might complicate the structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propenoate ester. For example, the substituent could be O-CO-CH2CH2CH3. But then the CH2 groups would show up as CH2 signals, which the NMR doesn't show. So that's probably not it.

Hmm. Perhaps the substituent is a group with a methyl group and a vinyl group. Let me think of something like CH2=CHCH2O-CO-R. But maybe that's overcomplicating.

Wait, the NMR shows two CH3 groups. So each CH3 is in a different environment. So maybe one is attached to an oxygen (like in an ester), and another is attached to a carbon adjacent to a double bond.

Wait, another thought: the substituent could be a methyl group attached to a vinyl group. Like CH2=CHCH2-O-CO-R. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a group where there's a methyl group adjacent to the ester group. Like O-CO-OCH2CH2CH3 (but then there would be CH2 groups, which the NMR doesn't show).

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a group with a CH3 and a vinyl group, but no CH2. For example, O-CO-CH2CH2CH3 has CH2 groups, which we don't have. So that's not possible.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a methyl group and a vinyl group attached to the ring. So, the ring has an ester group (O-CO-O-R) and a substituent with a vinyl group and a methyl group. But I'm not sure how that would fit.

Let me think about the possible structures. The aromatic ring has two substituents: one is an ester group, and the other is a group that includes a vinyl group and methyl groups.

Wait, another approach: considering the molecular formulas. Let's calculate the possible degrees of unsaturation for each option.

The degree of unsaturation (DoU) is calculated as (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no halogens or nitrogen, so DoU = (2C +2 - H)/2.

Let's compute for each option:

Option A: C11H14O2
DoU = (2*11 +2 -14)/2 = (24-14)/2 = 5. So 5 DoU. Benzene ring (3 DoU from the ring itself and 3 from substituents—wait, maybe not. Alternatively, the ring contributes 4 DoU (since a benzene ring is 3 double bonds plus the ring itself?), but I'm getting a bit confused. Wait, each ring or double bond is one DoU. So benzene has 3 rings (no, benzene has one ring but three double bonds—so 4 DoU? No, no. Wait, benzene has three double bonds, so each is one DoU. So three DoU from the ring. Then substituents would add more.

Wait, no, the formula for DoU is 2C +2 - H - X + N all over 2. So for option A, 2*11 +2 =24; 24-14=10; 10/2=5 DoU. So 5 DoU. The benzene ring is 3 DoU (one ring and three double bonds?), wait no. Wait, each ring is one DoU, each double bond is one. Benzene has three double bonds (so three DoU) and one ring (so four DoU? No, that's incorrect. Wait no, each ring is one DoU. The benzene ring has one ring plus three double bonds, but since the ring itself is a six-membered ring with three double bonds, it contributes four DoU. Hmm, that can't be right. Wait, no, the degree of unsaturation counts each ring and each double bond as one. Benzene has three double bonds and one ring, so that's four DoU. So if the molecule has a benzene ring, then the remaining substituents would account for the rest.

So in option A, which has 5 DoU, the benzene accounts for four. So the substituents account for one. So perhaps an ester group, which has a double bond. So that fits.

Similarly, let's check option D: C11H12O2. DoU is (2*11 +2 -12)/2 = (24-12)/2=6. So six DoU. Benzene accounts for four, so substituents account for two. That could be an ester (one DoU) and another double bond. But the NMR doesn't indicate any additional double bonds apart from the vinyl group.

Wait, but the NMR shows vinyl protons, so that's one DoU. Then the ester is another DoU. So substituents contribute two DoU, making total DoU for substituents as two, which would make the overall DoU 4 (benzene) + 2 =6, which matches option D.

Wait, but let me check the other options.

Option C: C12H12O2. DoU: (2*12 +2 -12)/2 = (26-12)/2=7. So benzene (4) plus substituents (3 DoU). Hmm, that might be a possibility if there are multiple rings or double bonds in substituents, but the NMR doesn't suggest that.

Option B: C12H14O2. DoU: (2*12 +2 -14)/2= (26-14)/2=6. Benzene (4), substituents (2).

So, back to the NMR data. The ester is present, so that's one DoU in substituents. The vinyl group is another, so substituents contribute two DoU, which matches options A and D. Because options B and C have substituents contributing 2 and 3 respectively, but in our case, substituents have one (ester) and one (vinyl) DoU.

So, options A and D have substituents with two DoU.

So, the molecular formula could be either A or D.

Now, let's think about the structure again. The substituent with the vinyl group would contribute the other DoU. So let's imagine the molecule has a benzene ring with an ester group and a vinyl group attached.

Wait, wait. Let me think about the substituents.

If one substituent is an ester (like O-CO-R), and the other substituent is a vinyl group (CH2=CH–), then the substituents are each taking up a position on the benzene.

But the NMR shows two vinyl protons. So the substituent would be, for example, a CH2=CH– group attached to the ring.

Wait, but then each CH2=CH– would have two protons, each as a doublet. So the NMR would show two doublets, which matches the description: one doublet and one doublet of quartets. Wait, no. Or maybe the substituent is more complex.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an allyl group (CH2CHCH2–), but that's three carbons with a double bond. The protons on the double bond would be split into different signals. For example, the middle proton would be a quartet, and the other two would be doublets. Hmm, but that's getting a bit complicated.

Wait, the NMR says two signals: one doublet and one doublet of quartets. So maybe one of the vinyl protons is coupled to another proton, giving a doublet, and another proton is coupled to two different sets, giving a quartet.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a CH2=CH– group attached to another substituent, like an oxygen. For example, O–CH2–CH2– but that would have CH2 groups, which are not present in the NMR.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl ester. Like, the ester is part of a larger group with a double bond.

Wait, another approach: let's consider the number of CH3 groups. There are two, so the molecule has two different methyl groups. One could be from the ester (like an acetate group: O-CO-OCH3), contributing one CH3, and another substituent with a CH3.

But wait, the substituent with the vinyl group would have to account for the other CH3. So maybe the substituent is a CH2=CH– group attached to a methyl group. Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a methyl branch, but that might create CH2 groups, which we don't have.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a methyl group attached to a vinyl group, like CH2=CH–CH2–, but that would have CH2 groups, which are not in the NMR.

Hmm. Another thought: perhaps the substituent is a cyclopropane ring, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a group like CH2=CH–O–CO–R, where R is a methyl group. So the substituent would be an ester group, and the other substituent is a vinyl ether. Let's see:

So the benzene ring has two substituents: one is O–CO–R (ester), and the other is O–CH2–CH2–, but that would have CH2 groups.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a vinyl group attached to the ester. Like, the ester is part of a larger substituent that includes a double bond. For example, the substituent could be O–CO–CH2–CH2–, but that brings back CH2 groups.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a propenoate ester, where the ester is O–CO–CH2–CH2–CH3. But that would have CH2 groups, which are absent in the NMR.

Hmm, this is a bit tricky. Let's think about the molecular formula. The molecule has an ester group, which is O–CO–R. Let's say R is a methyl group. Then the ester contributes O2 and the R is CH3. So the ester part would be O–CO–OCH3 (if it's an ethyl ester, but wait, no, ethyl ester would be O–CO–CH2CH3, which would have a CH2 group, which our NMR doesn't show).

Wait, but the NMR doesn't show any CH2 groups, so R can't have any CH2. So R must be a methyl group or something else without CH2.

So if the ester is O–CO–OCH3, then R is methyl. That gives us one CH3 group from the ester. The other CH3 must come from another substituent on the benzene.

So the benzene has two substituents: one is O–CO–OCH3, and the other is a group that has a CH3 and a vinyl group. But what group would that be?

Wait, maybe the other substituent is a methylene group with a double bond. Like CH2=CH–, but then that group would have two protons. But then where would the other CH3 come from? Unless the substituent is a CH2=CH–CH3 group, but that's a propene group. The structure would be CH2=CH–CH3 attached to the ring. But that would have a CH2 group (the CH2 in CH2=CH–), but wait, the CH2 is part of the double bond, so it's a vinyl group, which is allowed.

So the substituents on the benzene would be O–CO–OCH3 and CH2=CH–CH3.

Wait, but CH2=CH–CH3 would have a CH2 group adjacent to the double bond. But in the molecule, would that CH2 group cause a signal in the NMR? Because vinyl protons are the ones on the double bond, and the adjacent CH2 would be a methylene group. But the NMR says there are no CH2 signals. So that can't be right.

Hmm, perhaps the substituent is a group where the CH3 is attached directly to the ring, and the vinyl group is attached to the same substituent.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl group attached to a methyl group, but that's not possible without a CH2.

Wait, let me think about the structure again. If the substituent is a vinyl group attached to a methyl group via an ether or ester, but that might complicate things.

Wait, another possibility: the substituent is an allyl group. The substituent is CH2=CH–CH2– attached to the ring. But that would have two CH2 groups: the CH2=CH– and the CH2– attached to the ring. But the NMR doesn't show any CH2 groups, so that's not possible.

Hmm. Maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let's think about the possible structures that fit the NMR data.

The molecule has:

- A benzene ring with two substituents.

- An ester group (O-CO-O-R).

- Two vinyl protons, one as a doublet, the other as a doublet of quartets.

- Two CH3 groups.

No CH2 groups.

So perhaps the substituent is a vinyl group connected to a methyl group via an oxygen. Like O–CH2–CH2–, but that brings back CH2 groups.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an ester where the R group is a vinyl group. So the substituent is O–CO–CH2–CH2–, but again, that brings CH2.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a methyl group attached to the ring, and the other substituent is a vinyl group attached to oxygen, such as O–CH2–CH2–, but that's again CH2 groups. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a group like CH3–O–CH2–CH2–, but that's again CH2.

Wait, perhaps the vinyl substituent is part of an oxygen-containing group, like an epoxide. But that's unlikely given the IR data, which points to an ester.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the substituent is a methyl group and a vinyl group attached via a single bond. Like the ring has two substituents: one is an ester (O–CO–OCH3), and the other is a CH3 group attached to a vinyl group. But how?

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a CH3 group and a vinyl group in a way that doesn't have any CH2. Like, the substituent is CH2=CH–O–CO–OCH3. But that would have an ether linkage, but the IR shows an ester, not an ether.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl group attached to a methyl group via a single bond. Like CH2=CH–CH3.

Wait, but that brings back the CH2 group in CH2=CH–, which would be a CH2, and the NMR doesn't show any CH2 signals. So that can't be.

Hmm. This is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I should try to count the carbons.

The molecular formula options are:

A) C11H14O2 → 11 carbons.

B) C12H14O2 → 12 carbons.

C) C12H12O2 →12 carbons.

D) C11H12O2 → 11 carbons.

The benzene ring has 6 carbons. The substituents contribute the remaining.

So, for option D (C11H12O2), 11-6=5 carbons from substituents.

Each substituent is attached to the ring. So two substituents: each would have (5 carbons)/2? Not sure, but substituents can't split into halves. So perhaps one substituent has 3 carbons and the other has 2.

Wait, for option D:

C11H12O2.

Benzene (6 C) + substituents (5 C) =11.

So substituents contribute 5 carbons.

If one substituent is an ester (O–CO–O-R), where R is, say, a methyl group, that's 3 carbons (O, C, O, and R=CH3). Wait, no: O–CO–O–CH3 is 4 atoms but only 1 carbon (the methyl). So substituent 1: O–CO–O–CH3 (three oxygen and two carbons: the COO group plus the methyl). So substituent 1 contributes 2 carbons (the COO and the methyl). Substituent 2 would then contribute 3 carbons.

Wait, but substituent 2 has to have a vinyl group and a CH3 group. So substituent 2 could be a propene group with a methyl attached. Like CH2=CH–CH3. But that's three carbons, which is possible.

Wait, but let's see: substituent 1 is O–CO–OCH3 (which is 2 carbons: the COO and the methyl). Substituent 2 is CH2=CH–CH3 (three carbons). So total substituent carbons: 2 +3 =5, which matches.

But then substituent 2 has a CH2=CH–CH3. The CH2=CH– would have a CH2 group adjacent to the double bond, which would show up in the NMR as a CH2 signal. But the NMR says there are no CH2 signals. So that would be a problem.

Wait, unless substituent 2 is a different structure. Maybe it's a methyl group attached to a vinyl group without any CH2. That seems impossible because the vinyl group is CH2=CH–.

Hmm, maybe substituent 2 is a methylene group, but that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps substituent 2 is a vinyl group attached directly to the ring without any CH2. Wait, that's impossible because a vinyl group is CH2=CH–.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the substituent is a group where the double bond is not adjacent to any CH2. Like, maybe a cyclopropane ring or something else, but that's getting too complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps substituent 2 is a methyl group attached to a benzene ring, but that doesn't explain the vinyl protons.

Wait, another possibility: substituent 2 is a group where the CH3 is attached directly to the ring, and the vinyl group is part of another substituent. But then the substituents would be O–CO–OCH3 and CH3, but that doesn't explain the vinyl protons.

Wait, perhaps substituent 1 is an ester (O–CO–OCH3) and substituent 2 is a group that has a vinyl group and a CH3 group, but without any CH2. How?

Wait, perhaps substituent 2 is a group like CH3–CH2–CH2– but that brings back CH2. No.

Wait, perhaps substituent 2 is a cyclopentyl group with a double bond? That's getting too complicated.

Wait, maybe substituent 2 is a group like CH2=CH–O–, but that would bring an ether linkage, which the IR doesn't indicate. The IR specifically shows an ester, not an ether.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Maybe I should think about the number of protons.

The NMR shows two aromatic protons. So the aromatic ring has two distinct sets of H. That suggests that the substituents are in positions that cause this. For example, meta substitution would lead to two sets of H on the ring.

Wait, in a meta di-substitution, the ring would have two equivalent H's in one position and two in another? Or maybe three and three. Wait, for meta substitution on benzene, each substituent is 1,3 positions apart. So the ring would have two types of H's: two in one position and two in another, and maybe one more. No, wait, the exact symmetry depends on the substituents.

Alternatively, maybe one substituent is strongly de-shielding and causes the H's around it to be different from the other substituent's H's. So the two substituents create two distinct environments for the aromatic H's, leading to two signals.

So, the aromatic part is probably a meta di-substituted benzene.

Now, the substituents: one is an ester, the other has a vinyl group and a CH3.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a methacrylate group. For example, the substituent could be a CH2=CH–COO– group attached to the ring.

Wait, that would make the substituent O-CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH2-... No, that’s not right.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a propenoate ester: O–CO–CH2–CH2–CH3. But that would have CH2 groups in the substituent, which the NMR doesn't show.

Hmm. I'm going in circles. Let's try to think about the molecular formula again.

Option D: C11H12O2. The benzene contributes 6 C, so substituents have 5 C. If substituent 1 is O–CO–OCH3 (ester, 3 C: COO and CH3), and substituent 2 is a vinyl group and a CH3.

Wait, substituent 2 would need to contribute 2 C (since 5-3=2). But a vinyl group is two C's (CH2=CH–), so substituent 2 would be CH2=CH–. But that's two C, but then where's the CH3 from the NMR?

Wait, substituent 1 is O–CO–OCH3 (3 C: COO and CH3), substituent 2 is CH2=CH–, which is 2 C (but no CH3). So that doesn't add up to two CH3 groups.

Hmm, this is getting too complicated. Maybe the correct answer is option A: C11H14O2.

Wait, let's calculate. Option A: 11 C.

Benzene: 6 C.

Substituents: 5 C.

If substituent 1 is an ester (O–CO–OCH3) → 3 C (COO and CH3).

Substituent 2: 2 C.

But substituent 2 needs to have a vinyl group and a CH3. But 2 C can't have both. So that can't be.

Hmm. Maybe substituent 2 is a methyl group attached to another group. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps one substituent is an ester (O–CO–OCH2CH3), but that would have CH2 groups, which the NMR doesn't show.

Wait, but the NMR shows no CH2 groups. So substituents can't have any CH2.

Wait, unless the substituent is a methyl group and a vinyl group attached to the same carbon. Like, a group like CH2=CH–CH3. But that brings CH2 groups again.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a cyclopropane ring with a double bond. But that's probably too complex.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a group with a CH3 attached directly to the ring and a vinyl group attached to another part, but that doesn't make sense.

I think I'm stuck on this part. Maybe I should look at the number of protons.

The NMR has:

- Two aromatic H's.

- Two vinyl H's: one doublet, one doublet of quartets.

- Two CH3 groups.

Total H's: 2 (aromatic) + 2 (vinyl) + 2* (CH3) → 2+2+6=10 H's?

Wait, no, the molecular formula tells us the number of H's. For example, option D: C11H12O2. So 12 H's.

Wait, let me recount the NMR H's. Each signal corresponds to a set of equivalent protons.

So:

Aromatic: two signals, which could be 2 H's each → 4 H's total.

Vinyl: two signals, each perhaps 1 H → 2 H's.

CH3: two signals, each perhaps 3 H's → 6 H's.

Total: 4+2+6=12 H's. Which matches option D: C11H12O2.

Wait, let me check:

Option D: C11H12O2. So 12 H's.

Aromatic: 4 H (two signals, each 2 H's).

Vinyl: 2 H (two signals, each 1 H).

CH3: 6 H (two signals, each 3 H's).

That adds up to 12 H's, which matches.

So option D would have 12 H's.

Now, what about the other options?

Option A: C11H14O2. 14 H's.

If aromatic H's are 4, vinyl 2, CH3 6 → 12. That's less than 14. So the remaining 2 H's must be somewhere else.

But the NMR doesn't show signals for them, which is odd. So perhaps the structure has more H's, but the NMR only shows the specified signals. Hmm.

Wait, but the NMR would only show the different environments. So if some H's are equivalent and in the same environment, they would be a single peak. So perhaps the substituents have some H's that are equivalent and not split into multiple signals.

But the question states that there are six signals. So all the protons are accounted for in those six signals.

Wait, for option D:

- Aromatic: 4 H.

- Vinyl: 2 H.

- CH3: 6 H.

Total: 12 H. So that fits.

For option A: C11H14O2. 14 H's. So where are the other two H's?

Perhaps they're in a CH2 group, but the NMR says no CH2 signals. So that's a problem.

Hmm. So the correct option is D: C11H12O2.

But wait, let me think again. The number of H's in the NMR adds up to 12 only if the substituents don't have any other H's.

Wait, for option D, the ester substituent is O–CO–OCH3 (so that's 3 H's from the methyl), and the other substituent is CH2=CH–CH3. Wait, but that would add more H's.

Wait, no, the substituent would have to be something else. Maybe the substituent is a group with two CH3's and a vinyl group.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is an isopropyl group attached to a vinyl group, but that would have CH2 groups.

I'm getting a bit stuck, but based on the number of H's matching, option D seems correct.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring with an ester group, as indicated by the IR spectrum. The NMR data provides the following key information:

1. **Aromatic protons**: Two signals corresponding to aromatic-H, suggesting the benzene ring has two distinct sets of equivalent protons. This is consistent with a meta or ortho substitution pattern.
2. **Vinyl protons**: Two signals, one as a doublet and the other as a doublet of quartets, indicating the presence of a vinyl group with specific coupling patterns.
3. **Methyl groups**: Two signals corresponding to –CH3 groups, with no signals for –CH2 groups, implying the absence of methylene groups in the molecule.

### Analysis of the Molecular Formula Options:
The molecular formula options are:
- **A) C11H14O2**
- **B) C12H14O2**
- **C) C12H12O2**
- **D) C11H12O2**

#### Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):
The DoU is calculated as:
\[
\text{DoU} = \frac{2C + 2 - H}{2}
\]
- **A) C11H14O2**:  
  \[
  \text{DoU} = \frac{2(11) + 2 - 14}{2} = \frac{24 - 14}{2} = 5
  \]
  Benzene contributes 4 DoU (3 from the ring and 1 from the three double bonds). The remaining 1 DoU is accounted for by the ester group.

- **B) C12H14O2**:  
  \[
  \text{DoU} = \frac{2(12) + 2 - 14}{2} = \frac{26 - 14}{2} = 6
  \]
  Benzene contributes 4 DoU, leaving 2 DoU for substituents. This could correspond to the ester group and a vinyl group.

- **C) C12H12O2**:  
  \[
  \text{DoU} = \frac{2(12) + 2 - 12}{2} = \frac{26 - 12}{2} = 7
  \]
  Benzene contributes 4 DoU, leaving 3 DoU for substituents. This is inconsistent with the NMR data, as there is no indication of additional unsaturation beyond the ester and vinyl groups.

- **D) C11H12O2**:  
  \[
  \text{DoU} = \frac{2(11) + 2 - 12}{2} = \frac{24 - 12}{2} = 6
  \]
  Benzene contributes 4 DoU, leaving 2 DoU for substituents. This matches the ester group and the vinyl group.

#### Hydrogen Count:
The NMR data accounts for all protons in the molecule:
- **Aromatic protons**: 4 H (2 signals, 2 H each).
- **Vinyl protons**: 2 H (2 signals, 1 H each).
- **Methyl groups**: 6 H (2 signals, 3 H each).

This totals 12 H, which matches the molecular formula **C11H12O2** (option D). Other options, such as **C11H14O2** (option A), would require additional hydrogens that are not accounted for in the NMR data.

### Conclusion:
The molecular formula that satisfies the IR, NMR, and molecular formula constraints is **C11H12O2**.
