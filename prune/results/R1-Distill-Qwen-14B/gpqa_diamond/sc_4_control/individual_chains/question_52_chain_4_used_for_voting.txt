Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Hmm, let's try to break it down. The question is about the ratio of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels when a star has spots versus when it doesn't. The options are A to D, and I need to find the factor by which this ratio changes.

Alright, the star has certain parameters. When it's not covered by spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Wait, but wait, how does that work? Oh, right, spots are cooler regions, so when a significant part of the surface is covered, the average temperature of the star decreases.

The question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels. Let's call them level 1 and level 2. The ratio decreases when the star has spots. So without spots, the ratio is higher, and with spots, it's lower. I'm to find the factor by which this ratio changes.

I remember that in LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), the number of atoms in different energy levels can be described by the Boltzmann equation. The ratio of populations is given by (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2-E1)/(k*T) ), where g is the statistical weight, E is the energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

Wait, but wait, the problem says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when the star has spots, the overall effective temperature is lower. So when the star has spots, T is 5500 K, and without spots, it's 6000 K.

Wait, but wait again. The effective temperature is lower when there are spots. So the photosphere's overall T is lower in that case. But does the presence of spots affect the local temperature where the Ti atoms are? Or is this about the average, and perhaps the observer sees a blend?

Wait, the problem states that when the star's surface is not covered by spots, Teff is 6000 K. When 40% is covered, Teff is 5500 K. So the star's overall brightness is lower when spots are present, but the question is about the photospheric conditions. So for the photospheric conditions, the temperature is 6000 K without spots and 5500 K when spots are present? Or is it more complicated?

Wait, no, perhaps the photosphere's effective temperature refers to the integrated effect. However, the spots are cooler regions, so when the star is spotted, the average T is lower. But the Ti atoms are in regions where the temperature is either the normal photospheric temperature (6000 K) or in the spot regions (which are cooler, perhaps 5000 K or so?), but the problem doesn't give the temperature of the spots. Hmm, but the problem says the overall Teff is 5500 K when 40% is covered. So the model here is that when there are spots, the average emission is as if the star has a lower Teff.

But wait, this is a bit confusing because the star's surface isn't uniformly at 5500 K. Instead, parts are at 6000 K (unspotted) and others at a lower temperature (spots). But for the purpose of this problem, the question is about the ratio in the photosphere when the star has spots. So perhaps the photosphere as a whole has an effective temperature of 5500 K when spots are present.

Wait, but wait. The problem states that the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500 K when 40% is covered. So the photosphere's overall Teff is lower. But each point on the surface might have its own T. But the question is about the ratio of Ti atoms in two levels in the photosphere. So perhaps the question is assuming that the photosphere's temperature is 5500 K when spots are present, and 6000 K otherwise. Or maybe each region (spot and non-spot) is at a different T, but the question is about the overall ratio.

Wait, the problem says, "when examining the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energetic levels (level 1 and level 2), astronomers have observed that this ratio decreases when the star has spots." So the observed ratio is lower when there are spots. So how does that affect the calculation?

Wait, the ratio is (n2)/(n1). With spots, the ratio is lower. Without spots, it's higher. So the factor is (n2/n1)_no_spots / (n2/n1)_with_spots = ?

The ratio without spots is higher, so the factor is greater than 1.

Hmm, but wait, let me think about the Boltzmann equation. The ratio is (g2/g1) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) ). Where ΔE is E2 - E1. So if T decreases (when spots are present), the exponent becomes more negative or less positive? Let's see: higher T makes the exponential term larger, so the ratio increases. So when T decreases, the ratio (n2/n1) would decrease if level 2 is higher than level 1.

Wait, because for (n2/n1) = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) ). So if E2 > E1, then (E2-E1) is positive. So when T decreases, the denominator (k T) is smaller, making -(E2-E1)/(k T) more negative. So exp of a more negative number is smaller. So (n2/n1) decreases when T decreases if E2 > E1.

So in this problem, the ratio (n2/n1) with spots is lower, which makes sense because T is lower. So without spots, the ratio is higher.

The transition corresponds to a wavelength of 1448 Å. I guess that's in the UV or near UV. But how does that relate to the energy difference between levels?

Wait, Planck's equation relates energy to wavelength: E = hc / λ. Let me compute ΔE in terms of k T.

We can compute the energy difference between the levels using E = hc/(lambda). Then, compute the exponent term.

But wait, let's compute ΔE/(k T) for each case.

So, let me calculate the ratio (n2/n1) when T is 6000 K, and when T is 5500 K. Then, find the ratio of these two.

But wait, the problem says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when T is lower, (n2/n1) is lower, which fits with the given scenario.

So let's compute the ratio of (n2/n1)_6000K to (n2/n1)_5500K.

The ratio is [(g2/g1) exp(-ΔE/(k * 6000)) ] / [(g2/g1) exp(-ΔE/(k *5500)) ] = exp[ (ΔE/(k)) (1/5500 - 1/6000) ) ]

Wait, wait, let me see:

(n2/n1)_T1 / (n2/n1)_T2 = exp( [ -ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) ] ) ) = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) )

Wait, because the exponents are subtracted when you take the ratio. Let me make sure.

(n2/n1)_T1 = (g2/g1) exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )
(n2/n1)_T2 = (g2/g1) exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

So the ratio is [exp(-ΔE/(k T1))] / [exp(-ΔE/(k T2))] = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2 ) ) = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) )

So that's the factor by which the ratio increases when T increases (since T2 is 5500, T1 is 6000, so T2 < T1, so 1/T2 > 1/T1, so the exponent is positive. So the ratio is greater than 1. So the factor is exp( ΔE/(k) (1/5500 - 1/6000) )

Now, compute ΔE/(k) using the wavelength.

E = hc/(lambda). Let's compute E in terms of k*T. Because k is Boltzmann's constant, and we can express E in terms of k*T for each temperature.

But perhaps it's easier to compute (E)/(k) = (hc)/(k lambda) [which is a constant for the given wavelength].

So let's compute (E/k) = hc/(k lambda) = (6.626e-34 J s * 3e8 m/s) / ( (1.38e-23 J/K) * 1.448e-7 m )

Compute numerator: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J m.

Denominator: 1.38e-23 * 1.448e-7 = 1.38e-23 * 1.448e-7 = approx 1.38 * 1.448 = approx 1.997, and exponents: 1e-23 * 1e-7 =1e-30. So denominator is approximately 1.997e-30 J m.

So E/k = (1.9878e-25) / (1.997e-30) ) = approx (1.9878 / 1.997) * 1e5 ≈ roughly 1e5 (since 1.9878 is close to 2, and 1.997 is close to 2, so 2/2=1, so 1e5).

So (E/k) ≈ 1e5 K. Let me compute more accurately.

Wait, 6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J m.

Denominator: 1.38e-23 * 1.448e-7 = (1.38 * 1.448) = about 1.996, and exponents are 1e-23 * 1e-7=1e-30. So denominator is 1.996e-30 J m.

So 1.9878e-25 / 1.996e-30 = (1.9878 / 1.996) * 1e5 ≈ roughly 1.0006 * 1e5 ≈ 1.0006e5. So approximately 1e5 K.

So (E/k) ≈ 1e5 K.

Wait, but wait, that's an approximation. Let me compute it more accurately.

Compute numerator: 6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Denominator: 1.38e-23 * 1.448e-7.

Let me compute 1.38 * 1.448. 1*1.448=1.448, 0.38*1.448= approx 0.550. So total is 1.448 + 0.550 = 1.998. So 1.38e-23 * 1.448e-7 = 1.998e-30.

So E/k = (1.9878e-25)/(1.998e-30) ) = (1.9878 / 1.998) * 1e5.

1.9878 / 1.998 ≈ approximately 0.995.

So E/k ≈ 0.995e5 ≈ 99500 K.

So approximately 99500 K. Let's take it as about 1e5 K for simplicity.

So (E/k) ≈ 1e5 K.

So now, the exponent is (E/k) * (1/5500 - 1/6000) = 1e5 * ( (6000 -5500)/(5500*6000) ) = 1e5 * (500)/(5500 *6000 )

Compute 500/(5500*6000) = 500/(33,000,000) = 5e2 / 3.3e7 = approx 1.515e-5.

So 1e5 * 1.515e-5 = 1.515.

So exponent is approximately 1.515.

So the factor is exp(1.515) ≈ e^1.515 ≈ let's compute that.

e^1 = 2.71828, e^0.5 is about 1.6487. So e^1.5 is e^1 * e^0.5 ≈ 2.718 * 1.6487 ≈ 4.48.

Wait, but wait, 1.515 is slightly higher than 1.5. Let me compute e^1.515.

Alternatively, 1.515 = 1.5 + 0.015. So e^1.5 is approximately 4.4817. e^0.015 is approximately 1.0151. So 4.4817 * 1.0151 ≈ 4.55.

So the factor is approximately 4.55. So the ratio without spots is about 4.5 times higher than with spots. But wait, let me double-check the exponent calculation.

Wait, (1/5500 -1/6000) = (6000 -5500)/(5500*6000) ) = 500/(33,000,000) ) = 500/(3.3e7) = 5e2 /3.3e7 = 5/(3.3e5) = 0.0000151515.

Wait, 500 / 33,000,000 = 500 / 3.3e7 = 0.00001515 approx.

Multiply by 1e5: 0.00001515 *1e5 = 1.515.

So exponent is 1.515. So exp(1.515) is approximately 4.55.

So the ratio (n2/n1)_no_spots / (n2/n1)_with_spots ≈ 4.55.

Looking at the options, option C is ~4.5, which is close.

Wait, but wait—wait a second. Let me make sure I have the correct ratio.

The ratio is (n2/n1)_6000 / (n2/n1)_5500 = exp(1.515) ≈4.55. So the factor is about 4.5, so option C is correct.

But let me think again: since the wavelength is 1448 A, which is in the UV. So the energy difference is significant. But I think the calculations are correct.

To determine the factor by which the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots, we use the Boltzmann equation. The ratio of populations is given by:

\[
\frac{n_2}{n_1} = \frac{g_2}{g_1} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT}\right),
\]

where \(g_2\) and \(g_1\) are the statistical weights, \(\Delta E = E_2 - E_1\) is the energy difference between the two levels, \(k\) is Boltzmann's constant, and \(T\) is the temperature.

The problem states that the effective temperature of the star decreases from \(T_1 = 6000 \, \text{K}\) (no spots) to \(T_2 = 5500 \, \text{K}\) (40% of the surface covered by spots). The ratio of the populations decreases when the star has spots, meaning the ratio is higher at \(T_1\) than at \(T_2\). We are tasked with finding the factor by which the ratio changes:

\[
\text{Factor} = \frac{\left(\frac{n_2}{n_1}\right)_{T_1}}{\left(\frac{n_2}{n_1}\right)_{T_2}} = \exp\left(\Delta E \cdot \frac{1}{k} \cdot \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right).
\]

### Step 1: Compute \(\Delta E / k\)
The energy difference \(\Delta E\) is related to the wavelength of the transition by Planck's equation:

\[
\Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda},
\]

where \(h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}\), \(c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}\), and \(\lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å} = 1.448 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m}\). Substituting these values:

\[
\Delta E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3 \times 10^8)}{1.448 \times 10^{-7}} = 1.387 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}.
\]

To express \(\Delta E\) in terms of \(kT\), we divide by Boltzmann's constant \(k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K}\):

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} = \frac{1.387 \times 10^{-19}}{1.38 \times 10^{-23}} \approx 10,000 \, \text{K}.
\]

Thus, \(\Delta E / k \approx 10,000 \, \text{K}\).

### Step 2: Compute the exponent
The temperature difference term is:

\[
\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} = \frac{1}{5500} - \frac{1}{6000}.
\]

Calculating each term:

\[
\frac{1}{5500} \approx 0.0001818, \quad \frac{1}{6000} \approx 0.0001667.
\]

Subtracting:

\[
\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} \approx 0.0001818 - 0.0001667 = 0.0000151.
\]

Now, multiply by \(\Delta E / k\):

\[
\Delta E \cdot \frac{1}{k} \cdot \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right) = 10,000 \cdot 0.0000151 = 0.151.
\]

### Step 3: Compute the factor
The factor is:

\[
\text{Factor} = \exp(0.151) \approx 1.163.
\]

### Step 4: Match with options
The closest option to \(1.163\) is **A) ~1.1**.
