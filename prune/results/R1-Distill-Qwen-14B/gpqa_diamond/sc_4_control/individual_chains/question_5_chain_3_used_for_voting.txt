Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of operators and eigenvectors. Let's see what the question says.

The problem is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n lying in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. Hmm, right, so P is a vector operator, and we're looking for its eigenvector when the direction is in the x-z plane.

Wait, the operator P is given in terms of its components: P_x, P_y, and P_z. Each is a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2. Let me write down the matrices first to get a clearer picture.

P_x is (ħ/2) times the matrix with first row [0,1], second row [1,0]. So that's the Pauli X matrix multiplied by ħ/2. Similarly, P_y is (ħ/2) times the matrix with first row [0, -i], second row [i, 0], which is the Pauli Y matrix scaled by ħ/2. And P_z is (ħ/2) times the Pauli Z matrix, which is diagonal with entries 1 and -1.

The operator in question is the vector operator P, so the actual operator along direction n is P · n, where n is a unit vector. Since n lies in the x-z plane, it can be written as (sinθ cosφ, 0, sinθ), but wait, wait—no, wait, in the x-z plane, the angle φ would be 0 or π, because in spherical coordinates, φ is the azimuthal angle. If the direction is in x-z, then φ is 0 or π. Alternatively, maybe the direction is along some angle θ in x-z plane. Oh wait, perhaps more accurately, the direction vector n can be represented as (sinθ, 0, cosθ), because in the x-z plane, the y-component is zero. Because in the x-y plane, φ is the angle around z, but here we're in x-z, so maybe θ is measured from the z-axis. So n = (sinθ cosφ, 0, sinθ sinφ) no—wait, no, wait. Wait, if the direction is in the x-z plane, then the y-component is zero. So n would be (cosθ, 0, sinθ), perhaps, where θ is the angle from the z-axis? Or maybe from the x-axis? Hmm, I might need to think about that more. Alternatively, maybe it's better to parameterize n as (cosθ, 0, sinθ), where θ is the angle from the positive z-axis, going towards the x-axis. So that when θ is 0, it's along +z, and θ=90°, it's along +x. Or maybe the opposite, depending on convention. But regardless, the key is that n is in the x-z plane, so it can be expressed in terms of θ and φ where φ is 0 or π, perhaps.

Wait, but the problem says "along an arbitrary direction n lying in the x-z plane". So we can parameterize n as (a, 0, b), where a² + b² = 1. Since it's arbitrary, maybe it's better to express it in terms of an angle θ from the z-axis. So n = (sinθ, 0, cosθ), right? Because when θ=0, you're along +z, and when θ=π/2, you're along +x. That makes sense.

Now, the operator P·n is P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z. Since n_y is zero (as n is in x-z plane), that term drops out.

So P·n = P_x n_x + P_z n_z.

Each of these components is a 2x2 matrix. Let's write them out.

P_x = ħ/2 * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
n_x = sinθ

P_z = ħ/2 * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]
n_z = cosθ

So P·n becomes (ħ/2) [n_x * [[0,1],[1,0]] + n_z * [[1,0],[0,-1]] ]

Let me compute that matrix.

Breaking it down:

n_x * [[0,1],[1,0]] is sinθ times the Pauli X matrix.
n_z * [[1,0],[0,-1]] is cosθ times the Pauli Z matrix.

So the sum is:

[[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]]

Wait wait, let me compute element-wise.
The first row: first element is (n_z * 1) + (n_x * 0) )? Wait, no, wait. No, when you multiply each matrix by n_x and n_z respectively, the sum would be:

Each term is the product of a scalar and a matrix. So for the (1,1) element: n_z * 1 (from P_z) plus n_x * 0 (from P_x), which is n_z. Similarly, (1,2) element is n_x * 1 (from P_x) plus n_z * 0 (from P_z), so n_x.

Same for (2,1): n_x * 1, because P_x is symmetric, and (2,2) is n_z * (-1), since P_z is 1 and -1 on the diagonal.

So the matrix becomes:

[ [n_z, n_x],
  [n_x, -n_z] ]

Multiply by ħ/2, so the entire operator is (ħ/2) times this matrix.

So the matrix operator is:

(ħ/2) * [ [n_z, n_x],
           [n_x, -n_z] ]

Which is the same as (ħ/2) times [ [cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ] ] since n_x = sinθ and n_z = cosθ.

Wait, wait earlier I thought n_x was sinθ. Let me confirm. If n is (sinθ,0, cosθ), then n_x is sinθ. So yes, correct.

So the P·n operator is (ħ/2) * [[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ]]

We need to find the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2.

Eigenvalue equation: (P·n) |ψ> = (+ħ/2) |ψ>

The matrix form of P·n is (ħ/2) * [[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ]]

So, let's represent the eigenvector as a column vector [a; b]. We can write the eigen equation as:

(ħ/2) * [[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ]] * [a; b] = (ħ/2)[a; b]

We can divide both sides by ħ/2 to simplify:

[[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ]] [a; b] = [a; b]

So the matrix equation becomes:

[ a' ; b' ] = [ a ; b ]

Which gives the equations:

a' = cosθ * a + sinθ * b = a
b' = sinθ * a - cosθ * b = b

So substituting, we get two equations:

1) cosθ * a + sinθ * b = a
2) sinθ * a - cosθ * b = b

Rearranging equation 1:

cosθ a + sinθ b = a
=> (cosθ - 1) a + sinθ b = 0

Similarly, equation 2:

sinθ a - (cosθ +1) b = 0

Wait, wait, equation 2:

sinθ a - cosθ b = b
=> sinθ a - cosθ b - b = 0
=> sinθ a - (cosθ + 1) b = 0

So from equation 1:

(cosθ - 1) a + sinθ b = 0

From equation 2:

sinθ a - (cosθ + 1) b = 0

Hmm, so we have two equations. Let me write them as:

(1) (cosθ -1) a + sinθ b = 0
(2) sinθ a - (cosθ +1) b = 0

We can solve these equations to find a and b.

Let me take equation (1) and solve for b in terms of a.

From equation (1):

sinθ b = (1 - cosθ) a
=> b = [ (1 - cosθ) / sinθ ] a

Similarly, equation (2):

sinθ a = (cosθ + 1) b
=> b = [ sinθ / (cosθ + 1) ] a

So from both equations, we have:

[ (1 - cosθ) / sinθ ] a = [ sinθ / (1 + cosθ) ] a

Wait, but both equal to b. So set them equal:

[ (1 - cosθ) / sinθ ] = [ sinθ / (1 + cosθ) ]

Let me check if this holds true.

Multiply both sides by sinθ (1 + cosθ) to eliminate denominators:

(1 - cosθ)(1 + cosθ) = (sinθ)^2

Left side: 1 - cos^2θ
Right side: sin^2θ

Which is true since sin^2θ = 1 - cos^2θ. So both expressions for b in terms of a are consistent.

So we can proceed with either expression. Let's use equation (1): b = [ (1 - cosθ) / sinθ ] a

But wait, (1 - cosθ) / sinθ can be simplified. Recall that 1 - cosθ = 2 sin²(θ/2), and sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2), so:

(1 - cosθ)/sinθ = [2 sin²(θ/2)] / [2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2)] ] = tan(θ/2)

So, b = tan(θ/2) a

Alternatively, a = (cos(θ/2)/sin(θ/2)) ) b, but perhaps it's easier to express in terms of a parameter.

Let me set a = 1 for simplicity, then b = tan(θ/2).

But wait, the eigenvector can be scaled by any non-zero scalar, so setting a = 1 is acceptable.

So our vector is [1; tan(θ/2)]

But we need to normalize the eigenvector. The normalization condition is |a|^2 + |b|^2 = 1.

Compute the squared magnitude:

|1|^2 + |tan(θ/2)|^2 = 1 + tan²(θ/2) = sec²(θ/2)

So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(sec²(θ/2)) ) = cos(θ/2)

Wait, wait. Let me compute it step by step.

So the vector is (1, tan(θ/2)).

The magnitude squared is 1^2 + (tan(θ/2))^2 = 1 + tan²(θ/2) = sec²(θ/2)

So the magnitude is sqrt(sec²(θ/2)) )= |sec(θ/2)|. Assuming θ is between 0 and π, so cos(θ/2) is positive, so sec(θ/2) is positive.

So the normalization factor is 1/ sqrt(1 + tan²(θ/2)) ) = cos(θ/2), because 1/sqrt( (sin² + cos²)/cos² ) ) = cos(theta/2)

So the normalized eigenvector is:

[ cos(theta/2) * 1, cos(theta/2) * tan(theta/2) ]^T
= [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]^T

Wait, because tan(theta/2) = sin(theta/2)/cos(theta/2), so multiplying by cos(theta/2) gives sin(theta/2).

So the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Wait, but wait—hold on. Let me think again. Because from the earlier steps, when I set a=1, then the vector is [1; tan(theta/2)]. But after normalization, it's [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Hmm, that seems correct. So the eigenvector is proportional to [1, tan(theta/2)]^T, and upon normalization, it's [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]^T.

But wait, are these the elements of the vector? Or are they multiplied by ħ or some other factor? Let me look back at the question.

The question asks for the elements of the normalized eigenvector. The options are given as, for example, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Wait, option C is written as (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which matches what I found.

But let me check the problem statement again to make sure. The operator is P · n, which is a 2x2 matrix, and the eigenvector is a 2-component spinor.

So the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]^T.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about the eigenvalues. The eigenvalues are ± ħ/2, and we're looking for the + case.

Wait, but the operator P·n is (ħ/2) times the matrix we've found. So when we solve for the eigenvalues, they should be ± ħ/2 multiplied by the eigenvalues of the matrix [[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ]].

Wait, perhaps I should compute the eigenvalues of the P·n matrix to make sure.

The matrix is:

(ħ/2) * [[cosθ, sinθ],
          [sinθ, -cosθ]]

Let me find its eigenvalues. The trace is (ħ/2)(cosθ - cosθ) )= 0. So the sum of eigenvalues is zero. The determinant is (ħ/2)^2 [ (cosθ)(-cosθ) - (sinθ)(sinθ) ) ] = (ħ/2)^2 [ -cos²θ - sin²θ ] = (-ħ²/4) (cos^2θ + sin^2θ) ) = -ħ²/4.

So eigenvalues are given by ± sqrt( (trace/2)^2 - determinant ). Since trace is zero, the eigenvalues are ± sqrt( - determinant ). Wait, determinant is -ħ²/4, so sqrt( - determinant ) is sqrt( ħ²/4 ) = ħ/2. So the eigenvalues are ± ħ/2, which matches the problem statement. So that's correct.

So the eigenvector we found is correct.

So the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]^T.

Looking at the options:

Option C says (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which matches.

Option D is (sqrt(2/3) hbar cos(theta/2), sqrt(1/3) hbar sin(theta/2)), but that has factors involving hbar, which doesn't make sense because the eigenvector should be a dimensionless vector (unless it's a probability amplitude, which I think is normalized differently).

Wait, wait, no. The eigenvector in quantum mechanics is a state vector, so the components are complex numbers (possibly), but they should be dimensionless. So any options with hbar in them are incorrect.

Looking at the options:

Option A: has sqrt(2/3) hbar and sqrt(1/3) hbar. These are vectors multiplied by hbar, which isn't correct. So A is out.

Option B: (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)) — this looks like a spherical coordinate representation, but not necessarily related to theta/2.

Option C: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)) — matches our result.

Option D: (sqrt(2/3) hbar cos(theta/2), sqrt(1/3) hbar sin(theta/2)) — again, has hbar, which doesn't make sense for a normalized eigenvector.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. The components should be dimensionless, yes. So options with hbar can't be right. So options A and D are out.

That leaves B and C.

Option B: (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)) — but our result is in terms of theta/2. So unless phi is zero, which is not mentioned, this doesn't match.

So the correct option is C.

The problem involves finding the normalized eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator $\vec{P}$ for a muon along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ lying in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The operator $\vec{P}$ is given in terms of its components $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$, each expressed as a 2x2 matrix multiplied by $\hbar/2$. The direction $\vec{n}$ is parameterized as $(\sin\theta, 0, \cos\theta)$, where $\theta$ is the angle from the z-axis.

The operator $\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n}$ is constructed as $P_x n_x + P_z n_z$, since the y-component of $\vec{n}$ is zero. Substituting the matrices for $P_x$ and $P_z$, the resulting operator is:

\[
\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvalue equation is:

\[
\left( \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix} \right) \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Dividing through by $\hbar/2$, the eigenvalue equation simplifies to:

\[
\begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix}.
\]

This leads to the system of equations:

\[
\cos\theta \, a + \sin\theta \, b = a, \quad \sin\theta \, a - \cos\theta \, b = b.
\]

Rearranging and solving these equations, we find that $b = \tan(\theta/2) \, a$. Setting $a = 1$ for simplicity, the eigenvector becomes:

\[
\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ \tan(\theta/2) \end{bmatrix}.
\]

To normalize the eigenvector, we compute the magnitude squared:

\[
|1|^2 + |\tan(\theta/2)|^2 = 1 + \tan^2(\theta/2) = \sec^2(\theta/2).
\]

The normalization factor is $1/\sqrt{\sec^2(\theta/2)} = \cos(\theta/2)$. Thus, the normalized eigenvector is:

\[
\begin{bmatrix} \cos(\theta/2) \\ \sin(\theta/2) \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Now, analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Includes $\hbar$ in the components, which is incorrect since eigenvectors are dimensionless.
- **Option B**: Represents a general spherical coordinate form but does not match the derived result, which involves $\theta/2$.
- **Option C**: Matches the derived normalized eigenvector $(\cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2))$.
- **Option D**: Includes $\hbar$ and additional normalization factors, which are not consistent with the derived result.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
