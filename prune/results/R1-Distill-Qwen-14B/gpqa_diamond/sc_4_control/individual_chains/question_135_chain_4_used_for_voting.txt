Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a boson. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll think through it.

The question gives me a Lagrangian for the interaction between a bosonic field X and fermions. The Lagrangian is written as L(y) = -λf f̄(y)(υ + X(y))ψ_f(y). Wait, actually, looking again, it's written as L(y) = -λf ψ_f̄(y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Or maybe I should parse it correctly. Oh, wait, the way it's written, it's probably -λ times some product of fermion fields and X.

Wait, the interaction term is probably something like -λ ψ_f̄ X ψ_f. So X is a boson field, and ψ_f is a fermion field. So the interaction term would couple X to fermions, meaning that X can decay into pairs of fermions.

The mass of the boson X is given as 6 GeV. So we're to find the kinematically allowed decays of X at the lowest order. So we're looking for fermion pairs that X can decay into, considering their masses.

Wait, since X is a boson, in lowest order it can decay into a pair of fermions if the mass of X is greater than or equal to twice the mass of the fermion. Each fermion has an antiparticle counterpart, so the decay products would be something like f and f-bar.

So the possible decay channels are X → f f̄, where f is a fermion.

But which fermions are light enough that 2m_f ≤ 6 GeV?

Let me think about the masses of the known fermions. The fermion masses I remember are:

Electron (e): very light, about 0.0005 GeV.

Muon (μ): around 0.1 GeV.

Tau (τ): around 1.78 GeV.

Quarks: up, down are light. Up is like 2 MeV, down maybe 4-5 MeV. Then strange is around 100 MeV, charm around 1.5 GeV, bottom around 4.5 GeV, top is way heavier, around 173 GeV.

So let's list the possible fermions:

1. Electron (e): mass ~0.0005 GeV. 2m_e ≈ 0.001 GeV << 6 GeV. So X can decay into e+ e-.

2. Muon (μ): 2m_mu ≈ 0.2 GeV, which is less than 6. So μ+ μ- is allowed.

3. Tau (τ): 2m_tau ≈ 3.56 GeV. 3.56 <6, so τ+ τ- is allowed.

But wait, 1.78 *2 is 3.56, which is less than 6, so yes.

4. For quarks, let's see:

- Up (u): 2m_u ≈ 0.004 GeV. So uū is allowed.

- Down (d): 2m_d ≈ 0.008 GeV. d d̄ allowed.

- Strange (s): mass ~ 100 MeV, so 2m_s ~ 0.2 GeV. Allowed.

- Charm (c): mass ~1.5 GeV. 2m_c is ~3 GeV, which is less than 6. So c c̄ allowed.

- Bottom (b): mass ~4.5 GeV. 2m_b is ~9 GeV. But X is 6 GeV, so 9>6. So X cannot decay into b b̄ because 6 < 9 GeV. So b is too heavy.

- Top (t): way too heavy, 173 GeV. So definitely can't decay into t t̄.

So possible fermions are e, μ, τ, u, d, s, c. And their antiparticles, but in decay products, it's just pairs.

So the possible decay channels are:

X → e+ e-

X → μ+ μ-

X → τ+ τ-

X → u ū

X → d d̄

X → s s̄

X → c c̄

Wait, but looking at the options, let's see the choices.

Option A: X→b b̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, τ+ τ-, e+ e-. But wait, X can't decay into b b̄ because X's mass is 6 GeV, which is less than 2mb (9 GeV). So option A includes b b̄ which is not allowed. So A is incorrect.

Option B: X→c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, τ+ τ-, μ+ μ-, e+ e-.

Wait, but option B includes c, which is allowed. So that's correct so far. But does it include the tau? Yes.

Wait, but what about the tau? 2m_tau is about 3.56 GeV, so yes, that's allowed.

Wait, but the problem is that the interaction term might not involve all these fermions. The given Lagrangian must be considered. Let's look at the interaction term again.

The interaction term is L = -λ f ψ_f̄ (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f (y).

Wait, actually, the term is probably something like L = -λ f ψ_f̄ X ψ_f, since v is a constant (the vacuum expectation value, perhaps, but perhaps it's a coupling constant). Alternatively, maybe it's L = -λ X ψ_f̄ ψ_f, assuming v is part of the mass term.

Wait, the way it's written in the question: it's -λ f f̄ (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, perhaps I'm getting the notation wrong. Let me parse it again. The term is written as:

L(y) = -λ f f̄ (y) [ (v + X(y) ) ] ψ_f(y )

Wait, perhaps that's a typo. Alternatively, perhaps it's meant to be L = - λ f ψ_f̄ (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y ). So the interaction term is for X coupling to fermions ψ_f, and f is some index. So X can interact with any fermion ψ_f, so any fermion can be a decay product if kinematics allow.

So the allowed decays are any fermion pair where 2m_f ≤ 6 GeV.

So the possible fermions are e, μ, τ, u, d, s, c.

Thus, the decay modes are X → e+ e-, μ+ μ-, τ+ τ-, u ū, d d̄, s s̄, c c̄.

Looking at the options:

Option B: includes c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, τ+ τ-, μ+ μ-, e+ e-.

So that's all the possible allowed fermions except for b.

Option C includes t, which is too heavy. So C is wrong.

Option D includes b but excludes c? Wait, let me check.

Option D: X→b b̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, τ+ τ-, μ+ μ-, e+ e-.

So D includes b, which is not allowed because 2mb is 9 GeV >6 GeV. So D is incorrect.

Option B is correct because it includes all the allowed fermions except for b. Wait, no, does it include c? Yes, because 2mc is about 3 GeV, which is allowed.

So the correct decay modes are all the fermions with m_f <=3 GeV. So e, μ, τ, u, d, s, c.

So which option lists all these except for the heavier ones?

Looking again, option B has all of them except perhaps the top, which isn't included anyway.

So the correct answer should be option B.

Wait, but looking at the options:

Option B is X→c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, τ+ τ-, μ+ μ-, e+ e-.

So that includes all except for b and t. Which is correct.

Option A includes b which is wrong. Option C includes t, which is wrong. Option D includes b which is wrong.

Therefore, the correct answer is option B.

The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decays of a boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV, based on the interaction term provided in the Lagrangian. The interaction term allows \( X \) to decay into fermion-antifermion pairs (\( f \bar{f} \)), provided the mass of \( X \) is at least twice the mass of the fermion (\( 2m_f \leq m_X \)).

### Step 1: Fermion Masses and Decay Channels
The masses of the known fermions are approximately:
- Electron (\( e \)): \( m_e \approx 0.0005 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_e \approx 0.001 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Muon (\( \mu \)): \( m_\mu \approx 0.1 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_\mu \approx 0.2 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Tau (\( \tau \)): \( m_\tau \approx 1.78 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_\tau \approx 3.56 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Up quark (\( u \)): \( m_u \approx 2 \, \text{MeV} \), \( 2m_u \approx 0.004 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Down quark (\( d \)): \( m_d \approx 4-5 \, \text{MeV} \), \( 2m_d \approx 0.008 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Strange quark (\( s \)): \( m_s \approx 100 \, \text{MeV} \), \( 2m_s \approx 0.2 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Charm quark (\( c \)): \( m_c \approx 1.5 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_c \approx 3.0 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Bottom quark (\( b \)): \( m_b \approx 4.5 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_b \approx 9.0 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Top quark (\( t \)): \( m_t \approx 173 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_t \approx 346 \, \text{GeV} \)

From these, the fermions with \( 2m_f \leq 6 \, \text{GeV} \) are:
- \( e, \mu, \tau, u, d, s, c \)

Thus, the allowed decay channels are:
\[
X \rightarrow e^+ e^-, \, \mu^+ \mu^-, \, \tau^+ \tau^-, \, u \bar{u}, \, d \bar{d}, \, s \bar{s}, \, c \bar{c}
\]

### Step 2: Analysis of Options
- **Option A**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed because \( 2m_b = 9.0 \, \text{GeV} > 6.0 \, \text{GeV} \). **Incorrect**.
- **Option B**: Lists \( c \bar{c}, s \bar{s}, u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, \tau^+ \tau^-, \mu^+ \mu^-, e^+ e^- \), which are all allowed fermion pairs. **Correct**.
- **Option C**: Includes \( t \bar{t} \), which is not allowed because \( 2m_t = 346 \, \text{GeV} > 6.0 \, \text{GeV} \). **Incorrect**.
- **Option D**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed because \( 2m_b = 9.0 \, \text{GeV} > 6.0 \, \text{GeV} \). **Incorrect**.

### Final Answer
The correct option is **B**, as it includes all the kinematically allowed decay channels for the boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV.

**Answer: B**
