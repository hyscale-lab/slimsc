Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, let me think. I remember that in classical mechanics, a harmonic oscillator has a maximum speed based on its amplitude and spring constant. But wait, this is relativistic, so I need to consider how relativity affects things.

The question gives a one-dimensional oscillator with mass m and maximum amplitude A. The force is given by Hooke's law, F = -kx. I need to find the maximum speed v_max.

In the non-relativistic case, the maximum speed occurs when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. So, (1/2)kA² = (1/2)mv², which gives v = sqrt(kA²/m). That's option C, but wait, this is the relativistic case, so that can't be the right answer here.

Relativity comes into play when the speed is a significant fraction of the speed of light. So, I should probably use relativistic energy equations. The total energy of the oscillator should be the sum of rest mass energy and kinetic energy, right?

Wait, in the relativistic harmonic oscillator, the system's energy isn't just kinetic and potential like in the classical case. Or maybe it's similar but the expressions are adjusted for relativity. I'm a bit fuzzy on that.

The potential energy in a harmonic oscillator is (1/2)kx². But relativistically, how does that translate? Or maybe we shouldn't use the classical potential. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps using the relativistic expressions for kinetic energy. The kinetic energy is given by (gamma - 1)mc², where gamma is the Lorentz factor, 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So, at maximum speed, the kinetic energy would be maximum.

But wait, the oscillator's total energy is a combination of kinetic and potential. In the non-relativistic case, the total energy is (1/2)kA², but in the relativistic case, maybe it's different. Or perhaps the potential energy is still (1/2)kA², but the kinetic energy has to account for relativity.

Wait, but the problem says the oscillator obeys Hooke's law, F = -kx. That's the same as the classical case. So perhaps the potential energy is still (1/2)kx². So, at maximum displacement (x = A), all the energy is potential, and at maximum speed (x=0), all is kinetic.

So, the total energy E should be (1/2)kA².

At maximum velocity, x=0, so the potential energy is zero, and the total energy is the kinetic energy. So,

E = K = (gamma - 1) m c².

So, E = (gamma - 1) m c² = (1/2)k A².

I can rearrange this:

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²), so:

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Let me denote (k A²)/(2 m c²) as a term for simplicity. Let's call it term = (k A²)/(2 m c²). So,

gamma = 1 + term.

Then,

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + term.

Taking reciprocal,

sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1/(1 + term).

Squaring both sides,

1 - v²/c² = 1/(1 + term)^2.

Rearranging,

v²/c² = 1 - 1/(1 + term)^2.

Factor the right side,

v²/c² = [ (1 + term)^2 -1 ]/(1 + term)^2.

Expanding numerator,

(1 + 2 term + term^2) -1 = 2 term + term^2.

So,

v²/c² = (2 term + term²) / (1 + term)^2.

Simplify numerator and denominator. Hmm, term is (kA²)/(2 m c²). Let me plug it back in.

Wait, but maybe I can write term as t for simplicity. So,

v²/c² = (2t + t²)/(1 + t)^2.

Factor numerator as t(2 + t), denominator as (1 + t)^2. Hmm, not sure if that helps. Alternatively, notice that 2t + t² = t(t + 2) and denominator (t +1)^2.

Wait, another approach. Let me write 2t + t² = t² + 2t +1 -1 = (t+1)^2 -1.

Oh, that's clever. So,

2t + t² = (t+1)^2 -1.

So,

v²/c² = [ (t+1)^2 -1 ] / (t+1)^2.

Which is,

v²/c² = 1 - (1)/(t+1)^2.

But t is (kA²)/(2 m c²).

So,

v² = c² [1 - 1/(1 + (kA²)/(2 m c²))^2 ].

Hmm, let me compute 1 + (kA²)/(2 m c²) = (2 m c² + k A²)/(2 m c²).

Wait, perhaps it's easier to write the expression as:

v_max^2 = c^2 [ 1 - 1/( (1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) )^2 ) ]

Which can be rewritten as,

v_max = c * sqrt( 1 - 1/( (1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) )^2 ) )

Looking at the options, option D is similar: v_max = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (kA²/(2 m c²)) )^2 ). So that matches.

Wait, but wait. Let me check the options again.

Option B is v_max = c sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (kA²/(2 m c²) )) )

Wait, that would be different. So, my derived formula is option D.

Wait, but I should double-check because sometimes it's easy to mix up terms.

Wait, in the equation I have:

v²/c² = 1 - [1/(1 + t)^2], where t is k A²/(2 m c²).

So, v/c = sqrt( 1 - (1/(1 + t)^2) )

Which is,

v/c = sqrt( [ (1 + t)^2 -1 ] / (1 + t)^2 )

(1 + t)^2 -1 = 1 + 2t + t² -1 = 2t + t².

So,

v/c = sqrt( (2t + t²)/(1 + t)^2 )

= sqrt( t(2 + t) ) / (1 + t )

But perhaps there's a better way.

Wait, another approach: maybe we can express gamma in terms of the energy.

Wait, but earlier, I set E = (gamma -1 ) m c² = (1/2) k A².

So,

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² )

Which is the same as,

gamma = 1 + t, where t is (k A²)/(2 m c² )

Then, gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + t.

So,

sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1/(1 + t )

Squaring both sides,

1 - v²/c² = 1/(1 + t)^2.

So,

v²/c² = 1 - 1/(1 + t )².

Which is,

v² = c² [ 1 - 1/(1 + t )² ]

Which is the same as,

v = c sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + t )² )

Which is the same as,

v = c sqrt( [ (1 + t )² -1 ] / (1 + t )² )

Which simplifies to,

v = c sqrt( ( (1 + 2t + t² ) -1 ) / (1 + t )² )

= c sqrt( ( 2t + t² ) / (1 + t )² )

= c sqrt( t (2 + t) ) / (1 + t )

Hmm, but looking at the options, option D is written as:

v_max = c sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (kA²/(2 m c² )) )² )

Which matches what I have.

So, the correct answer should be option D.

Wait, but let me check the other options again. 

Option A has 1 - (kA²/(2m)), but that would be non-relativistic term, which is not correct here because in the denominator it's 1- (k A²/(2m)), but in our case, the denominator is 1 + (kA²/(2 m c² )). So option A isn't matching.

Option B: 1/(1 - (kA²/(2 m c^2 )) ), but that would be a problem because if kA²/(2 m c^2 ) is positive, then denominator could be less than 1, leading to a larger value, but in our case, the denominator is 1 + t, so option B is not correct.

Option C is the non-relativistic case, which doesn't apply here.

So yes, option D is the correct one.

To determine the maximum speed \( v_{\text{max}} \) of a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass \( m \), maximum amplitude \( A \), and obeying Hooke's law \( F = -kx \), we must account for relativistic effects. The total energy of the system is the sum of the rest mass energy and the kinetic energy, which equals the potential energy at maximum amplitude \( x = A \). 

The total energy is given by:

\[
E = \frac{1}{2} k A^2
\]

At maximum velocity (\( x = 0 \)), all the energy is kinetic. The relativistic kinetic energy is expressed as:

\[
E = (\gamma - 1) m c^2
\]

Equating the total energy to the kinetic energy:

\[
\frac{1}{2} k A^2 = (\gamma - 1) m c^2
\]

Rearranging for \( \gamma \):

\[
\gamma = 1 + \frac{k A^2}{2 m c^2}
\]

The Lorentz factor \( \gamma \) is defined as:

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}
\]

Substituting \( \gamma = 1 + \frac{k A^2}{2 m c^2} \) into the expression for \( \gamma \):

\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = 1 + \frac{k A^2}{2 m c^2}
\]

Taking the reciprocal and squaring both sides:

\[
1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2} = \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{k A^2}{2 m c^2}\right)^2}
\]

Rearranging for \( v^2/c^2 \):

\[
\frac{v^2}{c^2} = 1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{k A^2}{2 m c^2}\right)^2}
\]

Simplifying:

\[
v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{k A^2}{2 m c^2}\right)^2}}
\]

This matches the form of option D. The other options are incorrect because:

- **Option A** incorrectly uses \( 1 - \frac{k A^2}{2m} \), which does not account for the relativistic factor \( c^2 \).
- **Option B** has an incorrect denominator structure, leading to a non-physical result.
- **Option C** is the non-relativistic result, which does not apply here.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: D**
