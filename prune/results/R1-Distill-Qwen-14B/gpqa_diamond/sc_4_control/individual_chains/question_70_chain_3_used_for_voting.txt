Okay, so I'm looking at this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out what the molecular symmetry group of product E is. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on my chemistry, but I'll take it slow.

First, the problem gives a series of reactions. Let me jot them down as I understand them:

1. Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C.
2. C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce product E, which is extremely hazardous.
3. C also reacts with water to reform A and two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid.
4. D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent.

I think I need to figure out the structures of these compounds, especially E, to determine its molecular symmetry.

Starting with reaction 4: D + B → H (solvent). H is a solvent, so maybe something like water or something else common. Wait, D and B reacting in a 1:1 ratio. Maybe they're combining to form something like HCl? Or perhaps something else. Alternatively, maybe B is H2O and D is something else. Hmm. Alternatively, if H is a solvent, perhaps it's something like ethanol or something else. But I'm not sure yet. Let's see other clues.

Looking at reaction 3: C + H2O → A + F + G. F is strong acid, G is weak. So, maybe when C reacts with water, it's undergoing hydrolysis. One product is a strong acid (like HCl) and another a weak acid (like maybe H2S? Or something else). Alternatively, if C is a sulfate or something that can hydrolyze into a strong and weak acid.

Reaction 1: A + 8 B → C. Bright red product. Bright red makes me think of something like copper compounds. Copper sulfate is blue, but maybe copper oxide? Or perhaps something else. Wait, another possibility is that A is a metal oxide and B is something like sulfur or another element. Alternatively, A could be a metal, B is a halogen, but not sure.

Wait, let me think about reaction 4 again. B and D reacting 1:1 to form H, a solvent. If H is a common solvent, perhaps it's H2O? So if B and D combine to make H2O, then what could B and D be? Maybe B is H2 and D is O2? But that would form H2O. Alternatively, B could be O2 and D H2, but that's the same thing. Alternatively, perhaps B is SO2 and D is something else. Hmm, not sure yet.

Alternatively, maybe H is something like hydrochloric acid or another acid. Wait, but H is a solvent, so it's probably something like ethanol, methanol, water, etc. Hmm.

Let me think about reaction 3: C + H2O → A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid). So, if C is a salt that when hydrolyzed gives a strong acid and a weak acid, what could that be? For example, if C is a sulfite salt, but not sure. Another possibility is that C is a nitrate, but when it hydrolyzes, maybe it forms a strong acid. Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfate, but that might not split into two acids.

Wait, another thought: maybe C is a sulfide. If C is a metal sulfide, reacting with water would produce H2S (a weak acid) and a corresponding strong acid. For example, if C is Na2S, then reacting with water might produce 2NaOH (strong base, so F could be something else). Hmm, not quite, because F is a strong acid. Maybe C is something like FeS, but then hydrolysis would produce Fe(OH)3 and H2S. Fe(OH)3 is a weak base, but I'm not so sure that's the case.

Alternatively, maybe C is a nitride. For example, if C is Ca3N2, then hydrolysis would give NH3 and a strong acid. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: if F is a strong acid, like HCl, and G is a weak acid, like acetic acid? Or maybe H2S? Hmm.

Let me think about reaction 1 again. A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to make C. The stoichiometry is 1 A :8 B → C. So perhaps A is a metal, B is a halogen, and C is a metal halide. For example, if A is copper (Cu) and B is Cl2, then Cu + 8 Cl2 → CuCl8^2-? But that might not make sense. Alternatively, perhaps A is Fe and B is Cl2, but 8 equivalents seem high. Alternatively, maybe A is a metal oxide and B is something else.

Wait, another possibility: A is FeO (iron oxide), and B is Cl2. But 8 equivalents would be a lot. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe B is H2S. So A could be a metal that reacts with H2S to form a sulfide. But then, in reaction 3, the sulfide would react with water to produce H2S (weak acid) and a metal hydroxide. But that would make F a strong base, not acid. Hmm, that doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe B is O2. So A is a metal, and B is O2, reacting to form a metal oxide. For example, if A is Fe and B is O2, then Fe + O2 → FeO, maybe? But I'm not certain about the stoichiometry. Alternatively, maybe A is sulfur and B is something else.

Wait, the product C is bright red. That's a big clue. What compounds are bright red? Copper(II) sulfate is blue, but perhaps something else. Maybe C is a chromium compound? Or perhaps it's a sulfide. Wait, maybe C is Ag2S—it's black, not red. Alternatively, perhaps it's a product like Fe2O3·nH2O, but that's more of a reddish color. Oh! Iron(III) oxide is reddish, like rust. So if C is Fe2O3, that's a possibility. So maybe A is Fe and B is O2. Let's see: Fe + O2 → Fe2O3. But the stoichiometry here would be 4 Fe + 3 O2 → 2 Fe2O3. So that would be 3 equivalents of O2 per 4 Fe, but the question says 8 equivalents of B. Hmm, maybe that's not the right approach.

Wait, another bright red solid—maybe a nitrate? I don't think so. Or perhaps it's a sulfide, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: maybe C is a product of a sulfonation reaction. Sulfonation typically involves adding a sulfonic acid group. But that might not fit the other clues.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a product of a reaction between a metal and sulfur. For example, FeS is black, not red. CuS is black too. Hmm. Maybe it's a different compound.

Wait, perhaps C is a nitrosyl compound. NOCl is yellowish, but maybe another nitrosyl is red. Not sure.

Wait, another approach: perhaps C is a transition metal complex that is bright red. For example, potassium dichromate is orange, but perhaps another compound is red. Alternatively, maybe it's a sulfide with a particular structure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a product of a reaction between a metal and chlorine. Wait, if A is copper, and B is Cl2, then the reaction could be 2 Cu + 4 Cl2 → 2 CuCl2 + 2 Cl2^- (but not sure about the stoichiometry here). Hmm, but I'm not certain about that.

Let me think about the other reactions. Reaction 2: C reacts with 2 equivalents of D to form E. E is extremely hazardous. So E could be something like chlorine gas, or maybe a highly toxic compound like hydrogen cyanide, but I'm not sure.

Wait, if D is a halogen, maybe E is something like phosgene (but that's more of a yellow gas, and I don't know if that's extremely hazardous enough). Alternatively, maybe E is a cyanide compound, but not sure.

Alternatively, let's think about reaction 4 again: D and B react in 1:1 to form H, which is a solvent. So if H is a common solvent, perhaps H is water. Then D and B would combine to make H2O. So D and B could be something like H2 and O2? But then H is H2O, which is a solvent. Alternatively, maybe D is H2O and B is O2? Hmm, not quite.

Wait, another thought: if H is ethanol, then perhaps D is CO2 and B is something else. Wait, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe B is H2O, and D is something else. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe B is NH3 and D is something else. Not sure.

Wait, perhaps D is a halogen. For example, if D is Cl2, then reaction 4 would involve B and Cl2 reacting to form H. If H is a solvent, maybe H is HCl (but that's a gas, not a solvent). Alternatively, maybe H is a solution of HCl, but that doesn't fit well.

Alternatively, if reaction 4 is B + D → H (solvent), maybe B is H2O and D is another component. Hmm.

Let me try to think of each reaction and see if I can find a pattern.

Reaction 3: C + H2O → A + F + G. F is strong, G weak. So possible acids could be HCl (strong) and H2S (weak). So if C is a compound that, when reacted with water, releases HCl and H2S, then C would be something like CH2Cl2S or similar, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, another possibility: C could be a sulfide of a metal that forms a strong acid upon hydrolysis. For example, if C is FeS, then hydrolysis would produce Fe(OH)2 (which is a weak base) and H2S (weak acid). But F is a strong acid, so that doesn't fit. Hmm.

Alternatively, if C is a nitride, like Mg3N2, then hydrolysis would produce Mg(OH)2 and NH3. But NH3 is a weak base, not an acid. Hmm, not matching.

Wait, perhaps C is a sulfate ester. For example, if C is something like (RO)2SO4, which upon hydrolysis forms RSO3H (a strong acid, maybe) and another acid. Not sure.

Wait, maybe C is a diacid, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps C is a mixed salt. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: looking for E is extremely hazardous. So E could be something like ClF3, which is a highly toxic and reactive gas. But I'm not sure if that's the case here.

Alternatively, E could be something like phosgene, but phosgene is a toxic gas, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another thought: perhaps E is a highly toxic gas like HCN (hydrogen cyanide), which is a colorless gas but is extremely dangerous. Alternatively, maybe it's NO2, which is a reddish-brown gas. But I'm not certain.

Wait, another angle: reaction 2 is C + 2 D → E. If D is a halogen, say Cl2, and C is a metal compound, then E could be a dihalide.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfide, and D is a halogen. So, for example, C could be FeS, and D could be Cl2. Then E would be FeCl2 and S (but that's a solid, not a gas). Hmm, not matching.

Wait, maybe C is a nitride. For instance, if C is NH3, but that's a gas, not a solid. Alternatively, maybe C is a metal nitride. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfate. Let's say C is CuSO4, then reaction with water would produce CuSO4·5H2O, but that's not generating two acids. Hmm, not matching.

Wait, maybe C is a sulfonate ester, but I'm not certain.

Another approach: think about the possible symmetry groups. The options given are C2, D4h, D∞h, and C2v. These are all molecular point groups. 

D4h implies a high degree of symmetry, maybe something like a square planar or octahedral structure. D∞h is even higher, like a linear molecule with high symmetry, such as CO2 (which is D∞h). Wait, CO2 is linear and has D∞h symmetry. But CO2 is a gas, and the problem says E is a product, possibly a gas.

If E is CO2, then what would that imply about the reactions? Let me see.

But how does that fit into the other reactions? Let's think. Reaction 4: D reacts with B in 1:1 to form H, which is a solvent. If H is H2O (a common solvent), then D and B would combine to form H2O. So if D is O2 and B is H2, then H would be H2O. Because 2H2 + O2 → 2H2O. So 1:1 ratio of B:H2O's reactants.

Then, reaction 4: B (H2) + D (O2) → H (H2O). That makes sense.

Now, reaction 1: A + 8 B → C. B is H2. So 8 H2 (equivalents) reacting with A to form C. What could A be that reacts with H2 in such a large quantity?

Hmm, maybe A is a metal oxide. For example, Fe3O4 reacts with H2 to form Fe and H2O. But that's 4 H2 per Fe3O4. Not 8. Alternatively, perhaps A is a metal sulfide. For example, if A is FeS, then reaction with H2 might produce Fe and H2S. But let's think about the stoichiometry.

FeS + H2 → Fe + H2S. The reaction is FeS + H2 → Fe + H2S. So for each mole of FeS, one mole of H2 is used. If A is FeS, then 8 moles of H2 would mean 8 moles of FeS reacting, which would produce 8 Fe and 8 H2S. But that seems a bit off. Alternatively, perhaps A is a more complex compound.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe A is a metal carbonate. For example, CaCO3 + H2 → CaO + CO2 + H2O. But again, not matching the stoichiometry.

Wait, perhaps A is a metal nitride. For example, Mg3N2 + H2 → MgH2 + NH3. Let's check the stoichiometry:

Mg3N2 + 3 H2 → 3 MgH2 + 2 NH3.

So per Mg3N2, 3 H2 are consumed. But the reaction in question uses 8 equivalents of H2. So if the stoichiometric ratio is 3 H2 per 1 A, then 8 H2 would be (8/3) moles of A. But I'm not sure if that's the case.

Alternatively, perhaps A is a metal, and B is H2. For example, in a reaction where metal reacts with hydrogen gas to form a hydride. But I'm not familiar with that happening in such a high stoichiometric ratio.

This is getting a bit complicated. Let me think about reaction 2: C reacts with 2 equivalents of D (which we thought was O2) to form E. So C + 2 O2 → E.

If E is CO2, then perhaps C is a hydrocarbon or a compound containing carbon. But if C is a hydrocarbon, then reaction 3 (C + H2O → A + F + G) would produce something else. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps E is SO3, but that's a gas. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach. Let's think about E's molecular symmetry. The options are:

A) C2: a two-fold rotation axis, perhaps something like H2O (but H2O has C2v symmetry), or maybe something like a planar molecule with two-fold rotation.

B) D4h: high symmetry, like octahedral or square planar.

C) D∞h: infinite symmetry, like CO2 or linear molecules.

D) C2v: has a two-fold rotation and a vertical mirror plane, like H2O.

If E is a linear molecule, then its symmetry group would be D∞h, which is option C.

So what linear molecules are extremely hazardous? CO is a linear molecule, but I'm not sure. ClF3 is trigonal pyramidal (C3v symmetry). SO2 is bent (V-shaped), which is C2v.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps E is O3 (ozone), which is a triatomic linear molecule. Ozone has a bent structure, but I'm not sure about its symmetry group. Alternatively, perhaps E is a diatomic molecule like O2 or Cl2, but those are diatomic with D∞h symmetry.

Wait, O2 is a diatomic molecule with D∞h symmetry. So if E is O2, that would fit. But O2 is a gas, and the reaction is C + 2 D → E. If D is O2, then E would be O2 as well? That doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps E is Cl2O7 (dichlorodioxide), but I'm not certain about its structure.

Wait, another possibility: E is a linear molecule like CO (carbon monoxide). CO has a linear structure with D∞h symmetry. But CO is a gas and is toxic. So if E is CO, that would fit.

But let's see if that fits the reactions.

If E is CO, then reaction 2 is C + 2 D → CO. So what would C and D be?

If D is O2, then C + 2 O2 → CO. Then C would have to be something that reacts with O2 to produce CO. For example, if C is carbon (solid), then C + O2 → CO2, but that's not matching. Alternatively, perhaps C is a carbon-containing compound.

Wait, this is getting a bit tangled. Let me try to piece things together again.

If H is H2O (from reaction 4: B + D → H, which is H2O), then B is H2 and D is O2 (since 2H2 + O2 → 2H2O). So B is H2, D is O2.

Then, reaction 1: A + 8 H2 → C (bright red). What could A be? Maybe a transition metal that reacts with H2 under certain conditions.

Wait, perhaps A is Fe, and C is FeH2? Not sure, but let's think. Fe reacts with H2 under high pressure and temperature to form FeH2, but I'm not certain about the stoichiometry.

Alternatively, perhaps A is a metal oxide, like Fe3O4, and reaction with H2 produces Fe and H2O. But that's not matching the product C being bright red.

Wait, bright red product—maybe it's Fe(OH)3, which is reddish. But Fe(OH)3 isn't a solid formed in reaction 1; it's a hydroxide formed in reaction 3.

Wait, maybe reaction 1 is a reaction between a metal and H2 to form a metal hydride. For example, Na + H2 → NaH. But NaH is white, not red.

Alternatively, perhaps A is a metal, and B is H2. The reaction produces a metal hydride, but I'm not sure about the color.

Wait, another possibility: C is a sulfide. If A is FeS, but upon reaction with H2, it might produce Fe and H2S. Let's see:

FeS + H2 → Fe + H2S. So the stoichiometry would be 1 FeS :1 H2 → 1 Fe +1 H2S. But in reaction 1, it's 1 A :8 B → C. So 1 A reacts with 8 H2 to form C. So if A is FeS, then 8 H2 would produce 8 Fe and 8 H2S. That seems a bit off.

Alternatively, perhaps A is a more complex compound. Let me think about reaction 3 again: C + H2O → A + F + G. So if C is a sulfide, then A would be the metal, F and G the acids.

Wait, if C is FeS, then reaction with water would produce Fe(OH)2 and H2S. But Fe(OH)2 is a weak base, not an acid. Hmm. Alternatively, if C is a nitride, then reaction with water would produce NH3 and a metal hydroxide.

Wait, perhaps C is a carbonate? No, that wouldn't fit with the acids.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfate, but I'm not sure.

Let me try to think of C as a sulfide. So, C is a metal sulfide, which upon reacting with water produces H2S (weak acid) and the corresponding metal hydroxide (which is a base, not an acid). But in reaction 3, F is a strong acid and G is a weak acid. So that would require the hydroxide to be a strong acid, which doesn't make sense. So maybe C isn't a sulfide.

Hmm, perhaps C is a nitride. Let's say C is Mg3N2. Reaction with water would give Mg(OH)2 and NH3. Mg(OH)2 is a weak base, NH3 is a weak base. But the reaction is supposed to produce F (strong acid) and G (weak acid). So that doesn't fit.

Wait, another possibility: maybe C is a chloro compound. For example, C could be CCl4. But reacting with water wouldn't produce two acids; it would produce HCl and perhaps some other product.

Wait, perhaps C is a sulfuric acid anhydride or something like that. But I'm not certain.

Wait, maybe C is a metal chlorate. For example, if C is KClO3, then reaction with water would produce KClO3·H2O, but that doesn't split into two acids.

I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to think differently. Perhaps E is a highly toxic gas with a linear structure, which would suggest D∞h symmetry. So, which options fit that?

CO has D∞h symmetry, but it's a gas. But how would CO form from C and D?

If E is CO, then reaction 2 is C + 2 D → CO. If D is O2, then C must be a carbon-containing compound. For example, if C is carbon (solid), then C + O2 → CO2. But that's not matching the stoichiometry here. Alternatively, maybe C is a methyl group or something, but that's speculative.

Another possibility: perhaps E is SO2, which is a bent molecule with C2v symmetry. SO2 is a toxic gas. If E is SO2, then reaction 2 would be C + 2 O2 → SO2. Then C could be S, but S reacting with O2 would form SO2 or SO3. Hmm.

Wait, if C is S (solid), then reaction with O2 would form SO2 or SO3. Let's think:

S (solid) + O2 → SO2 (if 1 S + 1 O2 → 2 SO2?), but the stoichiometry would be 4 S + 2 O2 → 2 SO2 + 2 O2? Not sure.

Alternatively, reaction 2: C + 2 D → E. If D is O2, and E is SO2, then C must be S. Then reaction 1 would be A + 8 H2 → S (bright red). But S is bright yellow, not red. Hmm, not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps E is SO3, which is a trigonal planar molecule with D3h symmetry. But SO3 is a liquid or solid under certain conditions, not a gas. Hmm.

Wait, another highly toxic gas with a linear structure is HCN (hydrogen cyanide). HCN is linear and has D∞h symmetry. So if E is HCN, then reaction 2 would be C + 2 D → HCN. So what would C and D be?

If D is O2, then C would need to be a compound that reacts with O2 to form HCN. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps D is another element. Let me think: if HCN is formed from a reaction between C (which is a cyanide or something) and D (maybe Cl2?), but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps E is Cl2O, phosgene. Phosgene is OCl2, which is a linear molecule (O in the center with two Cl atoms). Phosgene has D∞h symmetry. So if E is phosgene, then reaction 2 would be C + 2 D → OCl2. D would need to be Cl2? Because reaction 2 uses D in a 1:2 ratio. So C + 2 Cl2 → OCl2. So what is C?

Alternatively, C could be COCl2, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps C is a chlorinated compound.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should focus on the symmetry part. The options are C2, D4h, D∞h, C2v.

Another thought: maybe E is a diatomic molecule like O2 or Cl2. O2 has D∞h symmetry, as does Cl2. So if E is O2, then reaction 2 would be C + 2 O2 → O2. That doesn't make sense. Alternatively, if E is Cl2, then reaction 2 would be C + 2 Cl2 → Cl2. Doesn't make sense.

Wait, another possibility: E is a linear molecule like CO2. CO2 has D∞h symmetry and is a gas. So if E is CO2, then reaction 2 is C + 2 O2 → CO2. So what is C?

C could be carbon (solid), but reaction 1 would involve carbon reacting with 8 H2. Carbon doesn't react with H2 under normal conditions, but under high pressure and temperature, maybe it forms CH4 or something else. Let's think: if A is carbon (solid), then reaction 1 is C + 8 H2 → something (C). But I'm not sure about the product.

Alternatively, if E is CO2, then reaction 2 is C + 2 O2 → CO2. So C would be carbon. Then reaction 1 would be A + 8 H2 → C (which is carbon). That doesn't make sense, as carbon isn't formed from a reaction with H2.

Wait, perhaps reaction 1 produces C (carbon), which then reacts with O2 to form CO2. But that would require C to be solid carbon.

Alternatively, maybe A is a metal carbonate. Let's say A is CaCO3. Then reaction 1 would be CaCO3 + 8 H2 → C (which would be CaO and H2O?), but I'm not sure.

This is getting too convoluted. Let me think again.

If E is phosgene (OCl2), which is a toxic gas with D∞h symmetry, then reaction 2 would be C + 2 Cl2 → OCl2. So what is C?

Phosgene is produced by the reaction of chlorinated compounds. For example, it's formed by the reaction of COCl2 with Cl2, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps C is COCl2, which would require D to be Cl2, but then reaction 2 would produce OCl2, which is phosgene. Hmm.

But I'm not sure about the reactions. Another angle: the reaction of C with water to produce A, F (strong acid), and G (weak acid). If C is a chloro compound, perhaps when it hydrolyzes, it produces HCl (strong acid) and another acid. For example, if C is CaCl2·2H2O, then hydrolysis would give Ca(OH)2 and HCl. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, if C is a chlorate, like KClO3. Hydrolysis would not produce two acids. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: C is a chlorosulfite or something similar. For example, if C is CHCl3, then hydrolysis would produce HCl and HClO (but I'm not certain about the products).

Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfonamide, which upon hydrolysis gives a strong acid and a weak acid. But this is getting too speculative.

Let me try to think about the symmetry groups again. If E has D∞h symmetry, which is option C, that would mean it's a linear molecule with a center of symmetry. Examples include CO2 (linear), HCN (linear), O2 (linear diatomic), Cl2 (linear diatomic), etc.

If E is O2, which is diatomic and has D∞h symmetry, then reaction 2 would be C + 2 O2 → O2. That doesn't make sense, as you can't produce O2 from O2. So E can't be O2.

If E is Cl2, same issue. It doesn't make sense for reaction 2 to produce Cl2 from Cl2.

If E is CO2, then reaction 2 is C + 2 O2 → CO2. So C must be carbon. Then reaction 1 would be A + 8 H2 → C (carbon). That doesn't make sense because A would have to be something that, when reacted with H2, produces carbon. Maybe A is a metal carbide, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a carbonate, but then reaction 3 would produce a metal, CO2, and another acid.

Wait, this is taking too long, and I'm not making progress. Let me try to make an educated guess based on the options and the reactions.

The problem states that E is extremely hazardous. A highly hazardous gas with high symmetry is likely a linear molecule, which would have D∞h symmetry. So option C is D∞h.

So, the molecular symmetry group of E is D∞h.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves a series of reactions leading to the formation of product E, which is described as extremely hazardous. The goal is to determine the molecular symmetry group of E. Here's the analysis:

1. **Reaction 4**: B and D react in a 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent. If H is water (H₂O), then B and D could be hydrogen (H₂) and oxygen (O₂), respectively. This fits the stoichiometry of 2H₂ + O₂ → 2H₂O.

2. **Reaction 1**: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B (likely H₂) to form bright red product C. A plausible candidate for C is a compound that reacts with H₂ to produce a bright red solid. However, the exact identity of A and C remains unclear.

3. **Reaction 2**: C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D (likely O₂) to form E, an extremely hazardous gas. E must be a linear molecule with high symmetry, as indicated by the options provided.

4. **Reaction 3**: C reacts with water to reform A and produce two acids, F (strong acid) and G (weak acid). This suggests that C is likely a compound that hydrolyzes to yield these products.

Given the options for molecular symmetry groups:
- **C2**: A two-fold rotation axis, typically seen in molecules like H₂O (but H₂O has C₂v symmetry).
- **D₄h**: High symmetry, often seen in square planar or octahedral molecules.
- **D∞h**: Infinite symmetry, characteristic of linear molecules like CO₂, O₂, Cl₂, or HCN.
- **C₂v**: A two-fold rotation axis and vertical mirror plane, seen in molecules like H₂O or SO₂.

E is described as extremely hazardous and likely a gas. A highly hazardous gas with linear geometry and high symmetry is consistent with a molecule like CO₂ (linear, D∞h symmetry) or HCN (linear, D∞h symmetry). These molecules fit the description of being extremely hazardous and having D∞h symmetry.

Thus, the molecular symmetry group of E is **D∞h**.

Answer: C
