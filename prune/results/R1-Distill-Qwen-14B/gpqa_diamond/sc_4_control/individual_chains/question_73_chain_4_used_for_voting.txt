Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. Two astronauts are moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, let's think about how to approach this.

First, the problem states that the two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at speeds 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. So, the first thing I need to do is figure out the relative speed between them. Oh wait, wait. In relativity, velocities don't just add up normally because of the speed limit c. So I can't just subtract them directly. I remember there's a formula for adding velocities in special relativity.

The formula for the relative velocity v between two objects moving at u and v is given by (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/c²). Wait, no, wait. Because when dealing with relative velocities, if one object is moving at u relative to another frame, and another is moving at v relative to that same frame, the relative velocity between them is (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/c²). But wait, I think I might have that backwards. Alternatively, maybe I should consider their frame of references.

Wait, in this case, both astronauts are moving in the same direction. So, let's say astronaut A has mass 2m and speed 0.6c, and astronaut B has mass 3m and speed 0.5c. So from A's perspective, what is the speed of B?

Hmm, I think the formula is (u - v) / (1 - (u v)/(c²)), but wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me get this straight.

Wait, astronaut B is moving at 0.5c in the same direction as A, which is 0.6c. So from A's frame, B's velocity would be (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 + (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)) ?

Wait, no, that might be if they were moving towards each other. Wait, no, the formula is v' = (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)), where u is the velocity of the second object in the first frame, and v is the velocity of the first frame as observed from the second.

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of the velocity addition formula. Suppose we have two frames, S and S'. S' is moving at velocity u relative to S. Then, an event that has velocity v in S would have velocity v' in S' as given by v' = (v - u)/(1 - (v u)/(c²)).

So in this scenario, if astronaut A is moving at 0.6c relative to the lab frame (let's say the lab frame is S), and astronaut B is moving at 0.5c in the same direction. So, from A's perspective (S' frame moving at 0.6c), what is B's speed?

So, applying the formula, u is 0.6c (the speed of S' relative to S), and v is 0.5c (B's speed in S). So v' is (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/(c²)).

Calculating numerator: 0.5c -0.6c = -0.1c. Denominator: 1 - (0.3 c²)/(c²) ) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7.

So v' = (-0.1c) / 0.7 ≈ -0.1428c. Wait, the negative sign indicates direction. Since both are moving in the same direction as the original frame, but B is behind A, from A's perspective, B is approaching from behind at about 0.1428c. So the relative speed's magnitude is approximately 0.143c. Looking at the options, I see option C and D have 0.14c as the relative speed. So that could be a possible answer.

Wait, but maybe I made a mistake in the formula. Oh wait, no. If both are moving in the same direction, the relative speed is (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 + (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)) )? Wait, wait, am I mixing the formula?

Wait, no, I think the correct formula is v' = (v - u)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)). Let me double-check this. So u is the velocity of the frame S' relative to S (so in this case, S' is moving at 0.6c relative to S), and v is the velocity of the object (B) in frame S. So B's speed in S' is (v - u)/(1 - (u v)/c²).

So plugging in, v=0.5c, u=0.6c:

v' = (0.5c -0.6c)/(1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/(c²)).

Simplify numerator: -0.1c.

Denominator: 1 - (0.3 c²)/(c²) => 0.7.

So v' = (-0.1c)/0.7 ≈ -0.1428c. So the relative speed is approximately 0.143c. But since the options have 0.14c, so about 0.14c.

So the relative speed is approximately 0.14c. That narrows the options down to either C or D.

Now, the second part is the total energy of the system. So, I need to calculate the total relativistic energy of both astronauts.

The relativistic energy of each is given by E = gamma * m c², where gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So for astronaut A (mass 2m, v=0.6c):

Gamma_A = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 -0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.

So E_A = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

For astronaut B (mass 3m, v=0.5c):

Gamma_B = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 -0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547.

So E_B = 1.1547 * 3m c² ≈ 3.464 m c².

Total energy E_total = E_A + E_B = 2.5 + 3.464 ≈ 5.964 m c².

Looking at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc², which matches closely. Option D says E=5 mc², which is lower. So the total energy is approximately 5.96 mc².

So, putting it together, the relative speed is 0.14c and the total energy is about 5.96 mc². So the correct option is C: v_rel =0.14c , E=5.96 mc^2.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation for Gamma_B. 0.5 squared is 0.25, so 1 - 0.25 is 0.75. Square root of 0.75 is about 0.8660. So 1/0.866 is approximately 1.1547. So 3m * 1.1547 c² is 3.464 m c². Adding 2.5 from A gives 5.964, which is 5.96 mc² when rounded to two decimal places. So option C is correct.

To solve the problem, we first calculate the relative speed between the two astronauts using the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{v_A - v_B}{1 - \frac{v_A v_B}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \(v_A = 0.6c\) and \(v_B = 0.5c\). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} \approx 0.143c
\]

Thus, the relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\), which matches the relative speed in options C and D.

Next, we calculate the total energy of the system. The relativistic energy of each astronaut is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

For astronaut A (\(m = 2m\), \(v = 0.6c\)):

\[
\gamma_A = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = \frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25
\]
\[
E_A = \gamma_A (2m) c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2
\]

For astronaut B (\(m = 3m\), \(v = 0.5c\)):

\[
\gamma_B = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]
\[
E_B = \gamma_B (3m) c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464m c^2
\]

The total energy of the system is:

\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_A + E_B = 2.5m c^2 + 3.464m c^2 \approx 5.964m c^2
\]

Rounding to two decimal places, \(E_{\text{total}} \approx 5.96m c^2\).

Combining the relative speed (\(v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c\)) and the total energy (\(E_{\text{total}} = 5.96m c^2\)), the correct answer is:
