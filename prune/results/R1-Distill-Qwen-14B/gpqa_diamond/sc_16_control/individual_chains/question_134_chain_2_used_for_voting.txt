Okay, so I have this chemistry problem about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when mixing some solutions. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through step by step.

First, the problem gives me three solutions: HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2. I need to find the enthalpy change when they're mixed. Wait, neutralization reactions usually involve acids and bases reacting to form water and a salt. The enthalpy of neutralization is the heat released when an acid is neutralized by a base, typically around -57 kJ/mol for strong acids and bases.

But wait, wait. I remember that when you mix different acids and bases, you have to figure out the limiting reactant. Because the amount that reacts will determine how much heat is released or absorbed.

Let me list the given data:

- HCl: 500 mL, 0.2 M
- H2SO4: 300 mL, 0.3 M
- Ba(OH)2: 200 mL, 0.5 M

Wait, HCl is a strong acid, H2SO4 is a strong acid too (but it's diprotic, so it can donate two H+ ions). Ba(OH)2 is a strong base as well. But wait, Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, but it's a dihydroxide, so each formula unit releases two OH- ions.

I need to find out how much acid and base are present, and determine the neutralization reaction.

Wait, wait another thing. When mixing these, the H+ from the acids will react with the OH- from the base. So first, I should calculate the total moles of H+ from the acids and the total moles of OH- from the base.

Let me start by calculating the moles of each.

For HCl:
Molarity = 0.2 M, volume = 500 mL = 0.5 L.
Moles HCl = Molarity × Volume = 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 mol.

Since HCl is a strong acid, it dissociates completely, so 0.1 mol HCl gives 0.1 mol H+.

For H2SO4:
Molarity = 0.3 M, volume = 300 mL = 0.3 L.
Moles H2SO4 = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 mol.

H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, so each mole gives 2 moles H+.
So moles H+ from H2SO4 = 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 mol.

Total H+ from acids: 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 mol.

Now for the base Ba(OH)2:
Molarity = 0.5 M, volume = 200 mL = 0.2 L.
Moles Ba(OH)2 = 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 mol.

Ba(OH)2 dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2 OH- per formula unit. So each mole gives 2 moles OH-.
Moles OH- from Ba(OH)2 = 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 mol.

Now, the neutralization reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O. The enthalpy per mole is about -57 kJ/mol (but sometimes it's given as -57.3 kJ/mol, but let's just go with -57 for this).

So, the limiting reagent here is the one which has fewer moles between H+ and OH-.

H+ total: 0.28 mol
OH- total: 0.2 mol.

So OH- is the limiting reagent, because 0.2 < 0.28. So all the OH- will react, and there will be some H+ left over.

The reaction will consume 0.2 mol of H+ and 0.2 mol of OH-, producing 0.2 mol of H2O, releasing 0.2 * (-57) = -11.4 kJ.

Wait, but wait a minute. The problem is about the enthalpy of neutralization. Oh, but wait, the options are in kcal and kJ. Let me check the units.

The options are A: kcal, B: kcal, C: kcal, D: kJ.

Wait, I calculated -11.4 kJ. Looking at the options, option B is -11.42 kcal. Hmm, but wait, I should convert either the calculation to kcal or the options to kJ.

Wait 1 calorie is approximately 4.184 joules, so 1 kJ is about 239.006 kcal. Wait no, wait, no, wait: 1 kJ is 1000 J. 1 kcal is 4184 J. So 1 kJ = 0.239 kcal.

Wait, let me think. 1 cal = 4.184 J. So 1 kJ is 1000 J, which is 1000 / 4184 ≈ 0.239 kcal. So to convert my result from kJ to kcal, I multiply by 0.239.

So -11.4 kJ × 0.239 ≈ let's compute that.

Wait, 11.4 * 0.239.

10 * 0.239 = 2.39, 1.4 *0.239 ≈0.3346. So sum is about 2.7246. So 11.4 *0.239 ≈ 2.7246. So 11.4 kJ is about 2.72 kcal. And since it's negative, it's -2.72 kcal.

Wait, but wait. Because the reaction I considered is the neutralization of H+ with OH-.

Wait, but wait: Total moles H+ from both acids is 0.28, and moles OH- is 0.2. So total moles of H+ after reaction: 0.08.

But the enthalpy for neutralization is per mole of H+ reacting. So 0.2 mol of H+ reacting with OH-, so 0.2 * (-57) = -11.4 kJ, which is -2.72 kcal (since 11.4 kJ = about 2.72 kcal, as I calculated earlier).

So the answer should be option A, which is -2.72 kcal.

Wait, but wait another thing. Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Because in the reaction, each mole of H+ gives 57 kJ (or about 13.7 kcal? Wait, no, wait: 57 kJ is about 13.63 kcal. Wait, no, wait. Because 1 kJ is about 0.239 kcal, so 57 kJ is 57 * 0.239 ≈13.6 kJ, but that's not right. Wait, no, no, wait, sorry, I'm getting confused.

Wait, 1 kcal is 4184 J. 1 kJ is 1000 J. So 1 kJ is ≈ 0.239 kcal. So to convert kJ to kcal, you multiply by 0.239.

Wait, so 57 kJ is 57 * 0.239 ≈13.6 kJ. Wait, but wait, that can't be right because 57 kJ is about 13.6 kJ? No, no, wait, no, that's not correct. Wait: 1 kcal is 4.184 kJ. So 1 kJ is 1/4.184 kcal, which is about 0.239 kcal.

So 57 kJ is 57 * 0.239 ≈13.6 kJ? No, that can't be. Wait, no, 57 kJ is 57,000 J. Convert that to kcal: 57,000 / 4184 ≈13.62 kcal. Oh, right! So 57 kJ is approximately 13.62 kcal.

Wait, but wait, in my initial calculation, I thought 0.2 mol of H+ reacting would release 0.2 * 57 kJ = 11.4 kJ, which is about 2.72 kcal. Because 11.4 kJ * (1 kcal /4.184 kJ ) ≈ 2.72 kcal.

So the answer is -2.72 kcal, which is option A.

Wait a second, but the options have option D as -16.0 kJ. So why would that be? Did I make a mistake somewhere?

Wait, perhaps I should check the stoichiometry again. Let me re-examine the moles of each component.

HCl:

Molarity = 0.2 M, Volume = 0.5 L → moles HCl = 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 mol. HCl → 1 H+ per mole, so 0.1 mol H+.

H2SO4: 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 mol. H2SO4 is diprotic, so 2 H+ per mole → 0.18 mol H+.

Total H+ from acids: 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 mol.

Ba(OH)2: 0.5 M * 0.2 L = 0.1 mol. Each Ba(OH)2 releases 2 OH- → 0.2 mol OH-.

So H+ is 0.28, OH- is 0.2. So OH- is the limiting reagent. All 0.2 mol OH- will react, and 0.08 mol H+ will remain.

So the neutralization is 0.2 mol H+ + 0.2 mol OH- → 0.2 mol H2O, releasing 0.2 * 57 kJ = 11.4 kJ. Since all the OH- is used, that's the amount.

So 11.4 kJ is approximately -11.4 kJ. But one of the options is -11.42 kcal, which is option B. Another option is -2.72 kcal (option A). Wait, but why are there options in different units?

Wait, the question says 'calculate the enthalpy of neutralization'—so if the textbook uses kJ or kcal? Hmm, but 57 kJ per mole is a standard value, so 0.2 moles would be 11.4 kJ. So the correct answer in kJ would be -11.4 kJ. But looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ, which is higher. So that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recalculate the moles.

Wait, wait: For HCl, 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 mol. Correct.

H2SO4: 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 mol. Correct. Each H2SO4 gives 2 H+ → 0.18 mol. Correct.

Ba(OH)2: 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 mol, which gives 0.2 mol OH-. Correct.

So, the moles are correct.

Wait, but the reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O. Each mole releases 57 kJ. So 0.2 moles would release 11.4 kJ.

So the enthalpy is -11.4 kJ.

Wait, but looking at the options, option B is -11.42 kcal, and option D is -16.0 kJ.

So in kJ, the correct answer should be approximately -11.4 kJ. But none of the options is exactly that except if option D is -16.0, which is way off.

Wait, perhaps I got the enthalpy value wrong. Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate using the exact ΔH in kcal.

Wait, 57 kJ is 57,000 J. To convert to kcal: 57,000 J / 4184 J/kcal ≈13.62 kcal.

So each mole of H+ contributes approximately 13.62 kcal.

So 0.2 moles would be 0.2 *13.62 = 2.724 kcal. So the enthalpy would be -2.724 kcal, which is approximately -2.72 kcal. So option A is -2.72 kcal, which would be the correct answer.

But wait, why does option B exist as -11.42 kcal? Because 0.2 mol multiplied by 57 kJ is 11.4 kJ, which is 11.4 * (1kcal/4.184 kJ) ≈ 2.72 kcal. So that matches option A.

Alternatively, if someone incorrectly uses 57 kJ per mole of acid or per mole of H+ and OH-, perhaps they could make a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering all the H+ and OH- available and not just the limiting reagent. But that can't be right because then you can't have more neutralization than the limiting reagent allows.

So the correct calculation is 0.2 moles reacting, leading to -2.72 kcal.

Looking back at the options, option A is -2.72 kcal, which is correct.

Wait, but another thought: Maybe the enthalpy of neutralization given is per mole of H2O formed. So maybe I should multiply by the number of moles of H2O formed, which is 0.2. So 0.2 * 57 kJ = 11.4 kJ, which is 2.72 kcal. So same as before.

Yes, so the answer should be option A: -2.72 kcal.

To calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when mixing the given solutions, we first determine the total moles of \( \text{H}^+ \) from the acids and the total moles of \( \text{OH}^- \) from the base. The limiting reagent will dictate the extent of the reaction.

### Step 1: Calculate moles of \( \text{H}^+ \) from acids
- **HCl**:  
  \( \text{Molarity} = 0.2 \, \text{M}, \, \text{Volume} = 500 \, \text{mL} = 0.5 \, \text{L} \)  
  Moles of HCl = \( 0.2 \times 0.5 = 0.1 \, \text{mol} \).  
  Each mole of HCl contributes 1 mole of \( \text{H}^+ \), so \( 0.1 \, \text{mol} \, \text{H}^+ \).

- **H}_2\text{SO}_4\):  
  \( \text{Molarity} = 0.3 \, \text{M}, \, \text{Volume} = 300 \, \text{mL} = 0.3 \, \text{L} \)  
  Moles of H\(_2\)SO\(_4\) = \( 0.3 \times 0.3 = 0.09 \, \text{mol} \).  
  Each mole of H\(_2\)SO\(_4\) contributes 2 moles of \( \text{H}^+ \), so \( 0.09 \times 2 = 0.18 \, \text{mol} \, \text{H}^+ \).

**Total \( \text{H}^+ \) from acids**:  
\( 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 \, \text{mol} \).

### Step 2: Calculate moles of \( \text{OH}^- \) from base
- **Ba(OH)\(_2\)**:  
  \( \text{Molarity} = 0.5 \, \text{M}, \, \text{Volume} = 200 \, \text{mL} = 0.2 \, \text{L} \)  
  Moles of Ba(OH)\(_2\) = \( 0.5 \times 0.2 = 0.1 \, \text{mol} \).  
  Each mole of Ba(OH)\(_2\) contributes 2 moles of \( \text{OH}^- \), so \( 0.1 \times 2 = 0.2 \, \text{mol} \, \text{OH}^- \).

### Step 3: Identify the limiting reagent
The reaction is \( \text{H}^+ + \text{OH}^- \to \text{H}_2\text{O} \).  
- Total \( \text{H}^+ \) = \( 0.28 \, \text{mol} \).  
- Total \( \text{OH}^- \) = \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \).  

Since \( \text{OH}^- \) is present in smaller quantity, it is the limiting reagent. All \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \) of \( \text{OH}^- \) will react, leaving \( 0.08 \, \text{mol} \) of \( \text{H}^+ \) unreacted.

### Step 4: Calculate the enthalpy change
The enthalpy of neutralization is approximately \( -57 \, \text{kJ/mol} \) per mole of \( \text{H}^+ \) reacting.  
For \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \) of \( \text{H}^+ \), the enthalpy change is:  
\[
\Delta H = 0.2 \times (-57) = -11.4 \, \text{kJ}.
\]

Convert \( -11.4 \, \text{kJ} \) to kilocalories (1 kJ = 0.239 kcal):  
\[
-11.4 \, \text{kJ} \times 0.239 = -2.72 \, \text{kcal}.
\]

### Step 5: Analyze the options
- **Option A**: \( -2.72 \, \text{kcal} \) — Correct, matches the calculated value.  
- **Option B**: \( -11.42 \, \text{kcal} \) — Incorrect, does not match the conversion from \( \text{kJ} \).  
- **Option C**: \( -3.80 \, \text{kcal} \) — Incorrect, not consistent with the calculation.  
- **Option D**: \( -16.0 \, \text{kJ} \) — Incorrect, does not match the calculated \( -11.4 \, \text{kJ} \).

### Final Answer:
**Answer: A**
