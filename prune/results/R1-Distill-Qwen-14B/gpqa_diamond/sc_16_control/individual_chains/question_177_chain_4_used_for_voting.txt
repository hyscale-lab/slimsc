Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it carefully.

So, the question says that there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Same with the mass—Star_1 is 1.5 times more massive. The astronomers found that the wavelengths where the stars appear brightest are the same. Also, the radial velocities are 0 for Star_1 and 700 km/s for Star_2. We're told to assume both stars radiate as black bodies and compute the luminosity ratio, which is Star_1's luminosity over Star_2's. The options are A to D, all around 2.2 to 2.35, so the factor is roughly around there.

Hmm. I think I remember that the luminosity of a star is related to its radius and temperature. Oh right, the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πσR²T⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. So luminosity depends on radius squared and temperature to the fourth power.

Wait, but to find the luminosity ratio, the constants would cancel out. So L1/L2 = (R1² T1⁴) / (R2² T2⁴). Since R1 is 1.5 R2, that part would be (1.5)^2, so 2.25 times. But the temperature part is trickier.

The part about the wavelengths at which they appear brightest—oh, that's the peak wavelength of their blackbody radiation. Wien's law says λ_max * T = constant (approximately 2.9×10^-3 m·K). So λ_max is the same for both stars. So if λ_max is the same, then T1 / T2 = (λ_max2) / (λ_max1) * (1) since λ_max is same. Oh wait, T is inversely proportional to λ_max. So since λ_max is same, T should be same? That would mean T1 = T2.

Wait, but that can't be right because if they have same temperature, then L1/L2 would be (R1²/R2²) * (T1⁴ / T2⁴) = (2.25) * 1, so 2.25. But wait, the options have higher factors, like 2.32, etc. So maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, but the stars are moving. Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0, so it's not moving towards or away from us much. Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s. Does that affect the observed wavelength? Like, Doppler shift. Because the star is moving, the light we observe would be Doppler shifted, which could affect the peak wavelength we measure.

Oh right! So the star's actual temperature is determined by the observed wavelength. So the star emits at a certain λ (based on its temperature), but if it's moving, that λ is shifted due to Doppler effect.

Wait, so the star's rest frame has a certain λ_max, but because Star_2 is moving towards us (radial velocity of 700 km/s), the observed λ would be blueshifted. Because when a star moves towards us, its light is blueshifted, so the observed λ is shorter than the emitted one. So the astronomers found the same λ_max for both stars. So the observed λ_max is the same, but the actual emitted λ_max (and hence actual temperature) might differ.

Let me think. Let's denote λ_observed as the wavelength at which the star appears brightest. For Star_1, it's at rest, so λ1_obs = λ1_emit. For Star_2, it's moving, so λ2_obs = λ2_emit * (1 - v / c), because of the Doppler effect. But wait, I might have the formula wrong. The Doppler shift formula is λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 - β)/(1 + β) ) ), where β is v/c. But wait, that's for relativistic speeds, and 700 km/s is a significant fraction of the speed of light (which is about 3e5 km/s). So 700/3e5 is about 0.002333, so β is 0.002333. So maybe I can approximate it.

Alternatively, the non-relativistic Doppler shift formula is λ_obs ≈ λ_rest * (1 + (v/c))^{-1}, where v is radial velocity towards us (so blueshift). So Star_2 is moving towards us at 700 km/s, so λ_obs for Star_2 is shorter than λ_emit. But the problem states that the observed wavelengths are the same for both stars. So, λ1_obs = λ2_obs.

But Star_1 is at rest, so λ1_obs = λ1_emit. Star_2 is moving, so λ2_obs = λ2_emit * (1 - v/c) ≈ λ2_emit (since v is small compared to c, but wait, 700 km/s is about 0.23% the speed of light. So the approximation might be okay, but perhaps we need to consider it more accurately.)

Wait, but the problem says the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. So λ1_emit = λ_obs1 = λ_obs2 = λ2_emit * Doppler factor.

Wait, the Doppler factor for wavelength when moving towards us is λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 - β) / (1 + β) ) ), but since β is small, maybe we can approximate it with a Taylor expansion.

Alternatively, let's think about it this way: λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 - v/c), but actually, for a source moving towards the observer, the observed wavelength is λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 - v/c) / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me get the correct Doppler shift formula for wavelength.

The relativistic Doppler shift formula for wavelength when the source is moving towards the observer is λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 - β) / (1 + β) ) ), where β = v/c.

Wait, let me double-check that. The standard Doppler shift formula for frequency is f_obs = f_rest * sqrt( (1 + β)/(1 - β) ) ), since the source is moving towards us. Since frequency and wavelength are inversely related, λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 - β)/(1 + β) )^(-1/2). Wait, maybe another approach: for non-relativistic speeds, the Doppler shift is approximately λ_obs ≈ λ_rest * (1 - v/c) when moving towards us. Because the observed wavelength is shorter than the emitted.

Wait, if the source is moving towards the observer, the observed wavelength is blueshifted, so it's shorter. So λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 - v/c), but that's only valid for v much smaller than c. So let me compute that.

Given v = 700 km/s. c is about 3e5 km/s. So v/c = 700 / 300,000 = 0.002333.

So λ_obs for Star_2 is λ2_emit * (1 - 0.002333) ≈ λ2_emit * 0.997667.

But the observed λ is the same for both stars, so λ1_emit = λ_obs = λ2_obs = λ2_emit * 0.997667.

So λ1_emit = λ2_emit * 0.997667.

But from Wien's law, λ_max * T = constant, so T is inversely proportional to λ_max. So T1 = (λ2_emit / λ1_emit) * T2.

Wait, since λ1_emit = λ2_emit * (0.997667), then λ2_emit = λ1_emit / 0.997667 ≈ λ1_emit * 1.00234.

So T1 = (λ2_emit / λ1_emit) * T2. Substituting λ2_emit = λ1_emit * (1/0.997667) = λ1_emit * 1.00234.

So λ2_emit / λ1_emit = (1.00234) * (λ1_emit) / λ1_emit) )= 1.00234.

So T1 = (1.00234) * T2.

Wait, no. Wien's law is λ_max * T = 2.8977719e-3 m·K. So T is inversely proportional to λ_max. So T1 = (λ2_emit / λ1_emit ) * T2.

Wait, because T1 = (λ2_emit / λ1_emit) * (1/(λ_max)) )? Wait, maybe I should think more carefully.

Let me denote:

For Star 1: λ1_emit = λ_max1. T1 = (2.8977e-3) / λ1_emit.

For Star 2: λ2_emit = λ_max2. T2 = (2.8977e-3) / λ_max2.

But since Star 2 is moving, the observed wavelength is λ_obs2 = λ2_emit * (1 - v/c) = λ2_emit * 0.997667.

And since λ_obs1 = λ1_emit, and λ_obs2 = λ_obs1, we have λ2_emit = λ_obs1 / 0.997667.

So λ2_emit = λ1_emit / 0.997667 ≈ λ1_emit * 1.00234.

So substituting into T2:

T2 = (2.8977e-3) / λ2_emit = (2.8977e-3) / (λ1_emit * 1.00234) ) = [2.8977e-3 / λ1_emit ] * (1/1.00234) ) = T1 * (1/1.00234).

So T1 = T2 * 1.00234.

So T1 is about 0.234% higher than T2.

Now, going back to the luminosity ratio.

L = 4πσ R² T⁴.

So L1/L2 = (R1^2 T1^4) / (R2^2 T2^4 ) = ( (R1/R2)^2 ) * ( (T1/T2)^4 ).

R1 is 1.5 R2, so (R1/R2) = 1.5.

(T1/T2) is approximately 1.00234.

So (T1/T2)^4 ≈ (1.00234)^4.

Calculating that: 1.00234^4.

Let me compute step by step.

First, let's compute ln(1.00234):

ln(1.00234) ≈ 0.002337 (since ln(1+x) ≈ x - x^2/2 + ..., and x is 0.00234, so x^2 is about 5e-6, which is negligible).

So ln(1.00234) ≈ 0.002337.

Then ln((1.00234)^4) = 4 * 0.002337 = 0.009348.

Exponentiating: e^0.009348 ≈ 1 + 0.009348 + (0.009348)^2/2 ≈ 1.009348 + 0.000043 ≈ 1.00939.

So (1.00234)^4 ≈ 1.00939.

So L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 * 1.00939 = 2.25 * 1.00939.

Calculate 2.25 * 1.00939.

Well, 2.25 * 1 = 2.25, 2.25 * 0.00939 = approx 0.021135.

So total is 2.25 + 0.021135 ≈ 2.2711.

But wait, the options are A) ~2.25, B) ~2.32, C) ~2.35, D) ~2.23.

Hmm, 2.27 is closer to 2.32, but it's not exactly that. Did I make a mistake in the calculation?

Wait, perhaps using a more accurate approximation for (1.00234)^4.

Alternatively, let me compute (1.00234)^4 more accurately.

Compute (1.00234)^2 first:

1.00234 * 1.00234.

= 1 + 2 * 0.00234 + (0.00234)^2.

= 1 + 0.00468 + 0.0000054756.

≈ 1.0046854756.

Then square that to get to the fourth power:

(1.0046854756)^2.

= (1 + 0.0046854756)^2.

= 1 + 2*(0.0046854756) + (0.0046854756)^2.

= 1 + 0.0093709512 + 0.00002195.

≈ 1.0093929.

So (1.00234)^4 ≈ 1.0093929.

So L1/L2 = (2.25) * 1.0093929 ≈ 2.25 * 1.00939.

2.25 * 0.00939 is about 0.0211375, so 2.25 + 0.0211375 = 2.2711375.

So approximately 2.27.

But the options don't have 2.27; the closest is B) ~2.32 and C) ~2.35.

Wait, perhaps my assumption about the Doppler shift is incorrect. Maybe I should compute it more accurately using the relativistic Doppler shift formula instead of the approximation.

The relativistic Doppler shift formula for wavelength is:

λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 - β) / (1 + β) ), where β = v/c.

Given v = 700 km/s, c = 3e5 km/s → β = 700 / 3e5 ≈ 0.0023333.

So (1 - β) = 0.9976667, (1 + β) = 1.0023333.

Compute sqrt( (0.9976667) / (1.0023333) )

Compute the ratio inside the sqrt: (0.9976667)/(1.0023333) ≈ 0.99536.

Wait, 0.9976667 / 1.0023333 = ?

Let me compute that: 0.9976667 / 1.0023333.

Let me compute 1.0023333 × 0.9953 = approximately 1.0023333 × 0.995 → 1.0023333 × (1000 - 5)/1000 = 1.0023333 - (1.0023333 * 5)/1000.

Wait, perhaps a better way. Let me compute 0.9976667 / 1.0023333.

Approximately:

(1 - 0.0023333) / (1 + 0.0023333) ≈ [ (1 - a) ] / (1 + a ) ≈ (1 - 2a ), using the approximation (1 - a)(1 - a) ≈ 1-2a for small a.

Wait, no, (1 - a)/(1 + a) ≈ (1 - a) (1 - a) ) ≈ 1 - 2a when a is small.

Because (1 - a)/(1 + a) = [ (1 - a) ] / [ 1 + a ] ≈ (1 - a) (1 - a) ) = 1 - 2a + a², but for small a, a² is negligible. So approximately 1-2a.

Here, a = 0.0023333.

So 1 - 2a ≈ 0.9953334.

So sqrt of that is sqrt(0.9953334) ≈ sqrt(1 - 0.0046666).

Approximate sqrt(1 - x) ≈ 1 - x/2 for small x.

So sqrt(0.9953334) ≈ 1 - (0.0046666)/2 = 1 - 0.0023333 = 0.9976667.

Wait, but that's the same as the numerator. Hmm, that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

Compute (0.9976667 / 1.0023333) = let me compute it as 0.9976667 ÷ 1.0023333.

Let me compute 0.9976667 ÷ 1.0023333.

Approximately, 0.9976667 × (1/1.0023333) → 1/1.0023333 ≈ 0.9976667.

So 0.9976667 × 0.9976667 = (approx) 0.995334.

Wait, that's not the right approach. Alternatively, perhaps I'll compute it as 0.9976667 / 1.0023333.

Compute 0.9976667 / 1.0023333 = (997666.7e-6) / (1002333.3e-6) ) ≈ 997666.7 / 1002333.3 ≈ 0.995334.

Wait, so the ratio is 0.995334, and sqrt(0.995334) ≈ ?

Compute sqrt(0.995334) = ?

Well, 0.995334 = 1 - 0.004666.

The square root of 1 - x is approximately 1 - x/2 when x is small.

So sqrt(0.995334) ≈ 1 - (0.004666)/2 = 1 - 0.002333 ≈ 0.997667.

So, λ_obs = λ_rest * 0.997667.

But wait, the observed wavelength for Star_2 is λ_obs2 = λ_rest2 * 0.997667.

And for Star_1, λ_obs1 = λ_rest1.

But the problem states that the observed wavelengths are the same. So λ_obs1 = λ_obs2 → λ_rest1 = λ_rest2 * 0.997667.

So λ_rest2 = λ_rest1 / 0.997667 ≈ λ_rest1 * 1.00234.

So, from Wien's law, λ_max is inversely proportional to T. So T1 = (λ_rest2 / λ_rest1) * T2.

λ_rest2 = λ_rest1 * 1.00234 → T1 = (1.00234) * T2.

So T1 = (1.00234) T2.

So the temperature ratio is 1.00234.

Now, compute (T1/T2)^4.

(1.00234)^4.

Let me compute it accurately.

1.00234^2 = (1 + 0.00234)^2 = 1 + 2*0.00234 + (0.00234)^2 ≈ 1.00468 + 0.0000054756 ≈ 1.0046854756.

Then, squaring again for the fourth power:

(1.0046854756)^2 ≈ (1.0046854756) * (1.0046854756).

Compute:

1.0046854756 * 1.0046854756.

= (1 + 0.0046854756) * (1 + 0.0046854756).

= 1 + 2*(0.0046854756) + (0.0046854756)^2.

= 1 + 0.0093709512 + (approx) 0.00002195.

= 1.0093929.

So (T1/T2)^4 ≈ 1.0093929.

Now, R1 is 1.5 R2, so (R1/R2)^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25.

So L1/L2 = 2.25 * 1.0093929 ≈ 2.271.

This is approximately 2.27, but the options don't have that. The options are A) 2.25, B) 2.32, C) 2.35, D) 2.23.

Hmm, seems like 2.27 is not an option. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the Doppler shift more accurately. Let me re-calculate the Doppler factor.

The exact Doppler shift formula for wavelength when the source is moving towards the observer is:

λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 - β) / (1 + β) ), where β = v/c.

v =700 km/s, c=3e5 km/s → β=7e2/(3e5)=7/300 ≈ 0.023333.

Wait, wait, wait! Wait, 700 km/s is 7e5 m/s divided by 3e8 m/s → no, wait, 700 km/s is 700,000 m/s, and c is 3e8 m/s. So β = 7e5 / 3e8 = 7/(300) ≈ 0.023333.

Wait, that's 2.333% the speed of light. Oh! So earlier, I thought v/c was 0.002333, but it's actually 0.02333. Oh no! I think I made a mistake earlier in the calculation of β.

So let's correct that.

Earlier, I thought v =700 km/s, c=3e5 km/s → 700/3e5=0.002333. But that's wrong because 3e5 km/s is 300,000 km/s, correct. So 700 / 300,000 = 0.002333.

Wait, no! 700 km/s is 0.7e3 km/s, and c is 3e5 km/s. So 0.7e3 / 3e5 = (0.7 / 300) = 0.002333. So my initial calculation was correct. So β is 0.002333, not 0.02333.

Wait, but wait, 700 km/s is 700,000 m/s, and c is 3e8 m/s. So 7e5 / 3e8 = 7/(300) ≈ 0.023333. Oh wait, no, 7e5 m/s is 700,000 m/s, which is 700 km/s. So in terms of km/s, 700 km/s is 700,000 m/s.

Wait, no, that's correct. So 700 km/s is 7e5 m/s, c is 3e8 m/s. So 7e5 /3e8 = 7/(300) ≈ 0.02333.

Wait, but wait, units. 700 km/s is 700,000 m/s. c is 299,792,458 m/s, approx 3e8 m/s. So 700,000 / 3e8 = 7/(3e2) )= 0.023333. So β is 0.023333, not 0.002333.

Ah, that's where I went wrong earlier. So β is 0.023333, not 0.002333. So that changes the Doppler calculation.

So let's correct that.

β = v/c = 700,000 m/s / 3e8 m/s = 700,000 / 300,000,000 = 7/(300) ≈ 0.023333.

So, for the Doppler shift, the formula is:

λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 - β)/(1 + β) )

So compute (1 - β)/(1 + β) = (1 - 0.023333)/(1 + 0.023333) = (0.976667)/(1.023333) ≈ 0.976667 / 1.023333 ≈ approximately 0.9538.

Compute sqrt(0.9538) ≈ 0.9766.

So λ_obs = λ_rest * 0.9766.

So for Star_2, λ_obs2 = λ_rest2 * 0.9766.

But the observed wavelengths are the same for both stars. So λ_obs1 = λ_rest1 = λ_obs2 = λ_rest2 * 0.9766.

So λ_rest2 = λ_rest1 / 0.9766 ≈ λ_rest1 * 1.024.

Because 1/0.9766 ≈ 1.024.

So λ_rest2 ≈ 1.024 * λ_rest1.

But from Wien's law, λ_max is inversely proportional to temperature. So for Star_1, T1 = (2.8977e-3 m·K)/λ_rest1.

Star_2's T2 = (2.8977e-3)/λ_rest2 = (2.8977e-3) / (1.024 * λ_rest1) ) = T1 * (1/1.024) ≈ T1 * 0.9766.

So T2 = T1 * 0.9766 → T1 = T2 / 0.9766 ≈ T2 * 1.024.

So T1 = 1.024 * T2.

Now, compute (T1/T2)^4 = (1.024)^4.

Calculate 1.024^2 first: 1.024 *1.024 = (1 + 0.024)^2 = 1 + 2*(0.024) + (0.024)^2 = 1 + 0.048 + 0.000576 = 1.048576.

Then, square that: (1.048576)^2.

Approximate it:

1.048576 * 1.048576.

= (1 + 0.048576)^2 = 1 + 2*0.048576 + (0.048576)^2.

= 1 + 0.097152 + 0.002360.

= 1.099512.

So (1.024)^4 ≈ 1.0995.

So (T1/T2)^4 ≈ 1.0995.

Now, R1 = 1.5 R2, so (R1/R2)^2 = 2.25.

Thus, L1/L2 = 2.25 * 1.0995 ≈ 2.25 * 1.1 → 2.475, but more accurately, 2.25*1.0995 = ?

Compute 2.25 * 1 = 2.25.

2.25 * 0.0995 = approx 0.223125.

So total is 2.25 + 0.223125 = 2.473125.

Wait, that's around 2.47, but the options are all up to 2.35.

Hmm, that doesn't match any option. Did I make a mistake in the temperature calculation?

Wait, perhaps I should re-examine.

Wait, if λ_obs is same for both stars, and Star_2 is moving towards us, then:

λ_obs1 = λ_rest1.

λ_obs2 = λ_rest2 * sqrt( (1-β)/(1+β) ) ) = λ_rest2 * 0.9766.

Set them equal: λ_rest1 = λ_rest2 * 0.9766 → λ_rest2 = λ_rest1 / 0.9766 ≈ 1.024 * λ_rest1.

From Wien's law, T ∝ 1/λ. So T_rest1 = (2.897e-3)/λ_rest1.

T_rest2 = (2.897e-3)/λ_rest2 = (2.897e-3)/(1.024 λ_rest1 ) = T_rest1 / 1.024.

So T_rest2 = T1 * (1/1.024) → T1 = T2 *1.024.

Wait, no, T1 is the temperature of Star_1, T2 is that of Star_2.

Wait, no, wait. Let me clarify.

Star_1: λ1 = λ_rest1. T1 = (2.89e-3)/λ1.

Star_2: λ_obs2 = λ_rest2 * 0.9766. But λ_obs2 = λ1.

So λ_rest2 = λ1 / 0.9766 = 1.024 * λ1.

Therefore, T2 = (2.89e-3) / λ_rest2 = (2.89e-3)/(1.024 * λ1 ) = T1 / 1.024.

So T1 = 1.024 * T2.

So (T1/T2) = 1.024.

So (T1/T2)^4 = (1.024)^4 ≈ 1.0995.

So L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 * (1.024)^4 = 2.25 * 1.0995 ≈ 2.474.

But none of the options are close to 2.47. So perhaps I made a mistake in my approach.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the spectral radiance maximum is at the same observed wavelength, but the actual emission is different. But perhaps I should consider that the star's temperature is determined by the rest frame, and the observed wavelength is affected by the Doppler shift.

Wait, another way: the peak emission wavelength of Star_2's rest frame is λ0. But due to its motion towards us, we observe λ = λ0 * sqrt( (1-β)/(1+β) ) = λ0 * 0.9766.

But Star_1 emits at λ1, and we observe that as λ1. So for the two observed wavelengths to be same, λ1 = λ0 * 0.9766 → λ0 = λ1 / 0.9766 ≈ 1.024 * λ1.

So Star_2's rest frame peak is at 1.024 * λ1. Since λ_max is inversely proportional to T, T2 = T1 * (λ1 / λ0) = T1 * (1/1.024) ≈ 0.9766 * T1.

Wait, so T2 = 0.9766 T1.

So the ratio is T1 / T2 = 1.024.

Wait, earlier I thought T1 = 1.024 T2, which is correct.

So L1/L2 = (R1^2 (T1^4)) / (R2^2 (T2^4)) ) = ( (1.5 R2)^2 / (R2^2) ) * ( T1^4 / T2^4 ) ) = 2.25 * (1.024)^4.

Which is 2.25 * 1.0995 ≈ 2.473.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps I'm making a mistake here.

Wait, perhaps the Doppler shift formula was used in reverse. Let me think again.

Doppler shift formula for wavelength when the source is moving towards us: observed wavelength is shorter, so λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 - β)/(1 + β) ) → which is less than λ_rest.

If both stars have the same observed λ_max, then for Star_2, its λ_rest is λ_obs / Doppler factor.

So for Star_2: λ_rest2 = λ_obs / sqrt( (1-beta)/(1+beta) ) ) = λ_obs * sqrt( (1+beta)/(1-beta) ) ).

Thus, λ_rest2 = lambda_obs * sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) ) ).

Similarly, Star_1's lambda_rest is lambda_obs.

So for Star_2, lambda_rest2 = lambda_obs * sqrt( (1 + beta) / (1 - beta) )

Which is lambda_obs * sqrt( (1 + 0.023333)/(1-0.023333) ) ) → sqrt( 1.023333 / 0.976667 ) ≈ sqrt(1.0479) ≈ 1.02356.

So lambda_rest2 = lambda_obs * 1.02356.

Thus, from Wien's law, T2 = (2.897e-3) / lambda_rest2 = (2.897e-3)/(1.02356 * lambda_obs) ) = T1_rest / 1.02356.

Wait, T1 is (2.897e-3)/lambda_obs.

So T2 = T1 * (1/1.02356 ) ≈ T1 * 0.9766.

So T1 = 1.024 * T2.

So (T1 / T2)^4 = (1.024)^4 ≈ 1.0995.

So L1/L2 = 2.25 * 1.0995 ≈ 2.473.

But the options are A) 2.25, B) 2.32, C) 2.35, D) 2.23.

Hmm, none is close to 2.47. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Alternative approach: perhaps the Doppler shift affects the observed temperature, not the actual temperature. Wait, but the question states that the stars radiate as blackbodies, and we should compute their luminosities. So the luminosity depends on their actual temperature and radius, not the observed.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the actual temperatures of the stars, considering their Doppler shifts.

Alternatively, perhaps the observed wavelengths are the same, but the stars' actual temperatures could be different because of their velocities.

Wait, for the observed wavelength, we use the Doppler formula. For Star_2, the observed wavelength λ_obs = λ_rest2 * sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) ).

Since λ_obs is same for both stars, λ_rest1 = λ_rest2 * sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) )

So lambda_rest1 = lambda_rest2 * D, where D is the Doppler factor for wavelength.

From Wien's law, T1 = (2.897e-3)/lambda_rest1, T2 = (2.897e-3)/lambda_rest2.

So T1 = T2 * (lambda_rest2 / lambda_rest1 ) = T2 / D.

So T1 = T2 / D.

So T_ratio = T1/T2 = 1/D.

What is D?

D is sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) ) = sqrt( (1 - 0.023333)/(1 + 0.023333) ) = sqrt(0.976667 / 1.023333) ) ≈ sqrt(0.9538) ≈ 0.9766.

So T1 = T2 / 0.9766 → T1 ≈ 1.024 T2.

Thus, (T1/T2)^4 = (1.024)^4 ≈ 1.0995.

So L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 * 1.0995 ≈ 2.25 * 1.0995 ≈ 2.474.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps the initial approach is incorrect. Maybe the Doppler shift is not affecting the luminosity ratio because the question states the observed wavelengths are the same, but the stars have different actual temperatures. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the luminosity is calculated based on the star's rest frame, not the observed. Since the star's actual temperature is higher (for Star_1) or lower (for Star_2) than what's observed.

Wait, but the problem says the astronomers calculated the luminosity assuming the stars radiate as black bodies, so probably the luminosity is based on the star's actual parameters, not the observed ones.

Alternatively, perhaps the Doppler shift affects the observed luminosity due to the change in observed flux. But I think that's more complicated, and the problem states to assume they radiate as black bodies, so perhaps we can ignore that and just use the actual temperatures and radii.

Wait, but based on the given data, the observed wavelength is the same, so the actual temperature of Star_2 is lower than Star_1. So the luminosity ratio is higher than 2.25.

But the options don't have 2.47. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the Doppler shift.

Wait, perhaps using the non-relativistic Doppler shift is better, despite the higher speed. Let me try that.

Non-relativistic Doppler shift for wavelength:

lambda_obs ≈ lambda_rest * (1 + v/c), but wait, for a source moving towards us, the observed wavelength is blueshifted, so it would be lambda_obs = lambda_rest * (1 - v/c).

But wait, the correct formula is: for a source moving towards the observer at speed v, the observed wavelength is lambda_obs = lambda_rest * (1 - v/c).

So, with v=700 km/s, c=3e5 km/s.

v/c = 700/3e5 = 0.002333.

So lambda_obs = lambda_rest * (1 - 0.002333) ≈ lambda_rest * 0.997667.

Since the observed wavelengths are same, lambda_obs1 = lambda_obs2 → lambda_rest1 = lambda_rest2 * 0.997667.

So lambda_rest2 = lambda_rest1 / 0.997667 ≈ lambda_rest1 * 1.00234.

From Wien's law, T is inversely proportional to lambda_rest. So T1 = (lambda_rest2 / lambda_rest1) * T2 = 1.00234 * T2.

So (T1/T2) = 1.00234.

So (T1/T2)^4 = (1.00234)^4 ≈ 1.00939.

So L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 * 1.00939 ≈ 2.25 * 1.00939 ≈ 2.271.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps the correct answer is not present, but the closest is B) ~2.32.

Wait, but 2.27 is not exactly matching any option. The options are A) ~2.25, which is 2.25, D) ~2.23, which is lower, B) ~2.32, which is a bit higher.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in (1.00234)^4.

Let me compute (1.00234)^4 more accurately.

(1.00234)^2 = 1.00234 * 1.00234.

Calculate 1 * 1 = 1.

1 * 0.00234 = 0.00234.

0.00234 * 1 = 0.00234.

0.00234 * 0.00234 ≈ 0.0000054756.

So sum is 1 + 0.00234 + 0.00234 + 0.0000054756 = 1.0046854756.

Now, square that:

(1.0046854756)^2.

= (1 + 0.0046854756)^2.

= 1^2 + 2 * 1 * 0.0046854756 + (0.0046854756)^2.

= 1 + 0.0093709512 + 0.00002195.

= 1.0093929.

So 1.0046854756^2 = 1.0093929.

So (1.00234)^4 = 1.0093929.

So L1/L2 = 2.25 * 1.0093929 ≈ 2.271.

Hmm.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps the intended approach was to ignore the Doppler shift, considering that the velocities are small. If that's the case, then L1/L2 would be (1.5)^2 = 2.25, which is option A. But the correct approach should include the Doppler effect because the velocities are significant.

Alternatively, perhaps the question assumes that only the radius matters, and the temperatures are the same, leading to L1/L2=2.25. But that would ignore the Doppler shift and the fact that the observed wavelengths are same.

Alternatively, perhaps the given velocities are insignificant, but v=700 km/s is about 0.2% of c, which is significant enough to require the Doppler consideration.

In conclusion, the correct calculation gives L1/L2 ≈2.27, which is not an option. But perhaps the intended answer is option B) ~2.32, which is close. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute (1.024)^4 accurately.

1.024^2 = 1.048576.

1.048576^2 = (1 + 0.048576)^2 = 1 + 2*(0.048576) + (0.048576)^2.

Which is 1 + 0.097152 + 0.002360 ≈ 1.099512.

So (1.024)^4 = 1.099512.

So L1/L2 = 2.25 * 1.099512 ≈ 2.25 * 1.1 → 2.475, but precise calculation is 2.25 * 1.0995 ≈ 2.473.

But no option matches. So perhaps the intended answer is option B) ~2.32, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the question says that the observed wavelengths are the same, but the actual λ_max are different. So perhaps to compute the actual luminosities, we must use the star's rest frames, which have different temperatures.

But I'm stuck. Since my calculation leads to approximately 2.27, but the options don't have that, perhaps the intended answer is option B) ~2.32, which is roughly 2.25 * (1.00939) ≈ 2.27, but close to 2.32.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute (1.00234)^4 more accurately.

Wait, 1.00234^4 = ?

1.00234^2 = 1.0046854756.

1.0046854756 squared.

Let me compute it as:

1.0046854756 * 1.0046854756.

Break it down:

= (1 + 0.0046854756)^2.

= 1 + 2 * 0.0046854756 + (0.0046854756)^2.

= 1 + 0.0093709512 + 0.00002195.

= 1.0093929012.

So (1.00234)^4 = approximately 1.0093929.

Thus, L1/L2=2.25 * 1.0093929 ≈ 2.25 * 1.0093929.

Compute 2.25 * 1.0093929:

2.25 * 1 = 2.25.

2.25 * 0.0093929 ≈ 0.021132.

Sum: 2.25 + 0.021132 = 2.271132.

So approximately 2.271.

Looking at the options, the closest higher is B) ~2.32, but it's still a bit off.

Alternatively, perhaps the question intended to ignore the Doppler shift, leading to L1/L2=2.25, which is option A.

But the question states that the observed wavelengths are the same, so Doppler shift must be considered.

Given the options, perhaps option B is intended as the correct answer, considering a more accurate calculation of the Doppler shift.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the Doppler shift factor.

Let me re-calculate the Doppler factor for beta=0.023333.

Doppler factor for wavelength: sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) ) = sqrt( (1 - 0.023333)/(1 + 0.023333) ) = sqrt( (0.976667)/(1.023333) )

Compute 0.976667 / 1.023333 = 0.976667 ÷ 1.023333.

Let me compute this division:

Approximate 1.023333 = 1 + 0.023333.

So 1.023333 ≈ 1.0233.

0.976667 / 1.0233 ≈ 0.9538.

sqrt(0.9538) ≈ 0.9766.

So the ratio (T1/T2) is 1/0.9766 ≈ 1.024.

So (1.024)^4 ≈ 1.0995.

Thus, I think my earlier calculation is correct.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps the intended answer is option B) ~2.32, which is approximately 2.25 * 1.037, but my calculation gives 2.27, which is not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B) ~2.32.

Wait, perhaps I should recompute the exact value.

Compute 2.25 * 1.0995.

2.25 * 1.0995 = 2.25*(1 + 0.0995) = 2.25 + 2.25*0.0995.

2.25 * 0.0995 = 0.223125.

So sum is 2.473125.

Hmm, but that's not matching.

Wait, perhaps the question intended to ignore the Doppler shift, leading to L1/L2 = 2.25, option A.

But I think the correct approach requires considering the Doppler shift, leading to a higher value of ~2.27, which is not among the options. So perhaps the question expects the answer without considering the Doppler shift, leading to option A) 2.25.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the Doppler shift factor. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the formula for the Doppler shift is v/c = 700 km/s / (3e5 km/s) = 0.002333.

Then, the Doppler factor is sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) ) = sqrt( (0.997667)/(1.002333) ) ≈ sqrt(0.995334) ≈ 0.99766.

So lambda_rest2 = lambda_obs / 0.99766 ≈ 1.00234 * lambda_obs.

Thus, T2 = (2.897e-3) / (1.00234 * lambda_obs) ) = T1 / 1.00234.

So T1 = 1.00234 * T2.

So (T1 / T2)^4 = (1.00234)^4 ≈ 1.00939.

Thus, L1/L2=2.25 * 1.00939 ≈ 2.271.

So, perhaps the intended answer is option B) ~2.32, but it's not matching. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is not present, but the closest is option B.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial assumption is incorrect and the Doppler shift doesn't affect the luminosity ratio because the observed wavelengths are same. So L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4. But if the observed wavelengths are same, then T1 and T2 as observed are same, leading to (T1/T2) =1, and L1/L2=2.25, option A.

But that would ignore the Doppler shift effect on the actual temperature. So perhaps the correct answer expected is A) 2.25.

Wait, perhaps the problem states that the stars appear brightest at the same wavelength, which would be the observed wavelength. So the rest frame wavelengths would be different, but the observed are same. Therefore, when calculating luminosity, which depends on actual parameters (radii and temperatures), the temperature ratio comes from the rest frame.

Thus, the correct approach is to calculate the actual temperatures of the stars, considering their Doppler shifts, leading to the luminosity ratio as ~2.27.

But since none of the options match, perhaps I made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the intended answer is B) ~2.32, which is the closest to 2.27.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate it more precisely.

Alternatively, perhaps the factor is (1.5)^2 * ( (1.00234)^4 ) = 2.25 * 1.00939 ≈ 2.271.

But 2.271 is approximately 2.27, which is not an option. So perhaps the correct answer is not there, but the closest is B) ~2.32.

But wait, perhaps I should compute (1.00234)^4 more accurately.

Alternative way: compute ln(1.00234) = 0.002337 (approx).

So ln( (1.00234)^4 ) = 4 * 0.002337 = 0.009348.

So e^0.009348 ≈ 1.00939.

So 2.25*1.00939=2.271.

No, same result.

Hmm. So perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but the closest option is B) ~2.32.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the Doppler shift formula.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the Doppler shift affects the observed flux, but the question says to calculate the luminosity as per the blackbody assumption. So perhaps the luminosity is determined by the star's rest frame parameters. The observed flux would be affected, but the luminosity itself is intrinsic.

So, for Star_2, its actual temperature is higher than what's observed. Wait, no: when a star moves towards us, the observed wavelength is shorter, implying higher temperature. So the observed temperature is higher. But the actual temperature is lower.

Wait, no. Let me think: if Star_2 is moving towards us, we observe a blueshift, so its observed wavelength is shorter than its actual emission. So from Wien's law, the observed temperature is higher than the actual temperature.

Wait, no. Wait, the observed wavelength is shorter → observed temperature is higher. So, T_obs = T_actual * (1 + v/c) / sqrt(1 - (v/c)^2).

Wait, perhaps I'm complicating this too much.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to proceed with the calculation as per the problem's given data, leading to L1/L2≈2.27, but since that's not an option, I'll have to choose the closest one, which is option B) ~2.32.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the luminosity ratio \( L_1 / L_2 \) of the two stars, we use the Stefan-Boltzmann law:

\[
L = 4\pi \sigma R^2 T^4
\]

The luminosity ratio is given by:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{R_1^2 T_1^4}{R_2^2 T_2^4} = \left(\frac{R_1}{R_2}\right)^2 \left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4
\]

### Step 1: Radius Ratio
The radius of Star_1 is \( R_1 = 1.5 R_2 \). Thus:

\[
\left(\frac{R_1}{R_2}\right)^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25
\]

### Step 2: Temperature Ratio
The problem states that the stars appear brightest at the same observed wavelength (\( \lambda_{\text{obs}} \)). Using Wien's law, \( \lambda_{\text{max}} \propto 1/T \), the actual temperature of each star is related to its emitted wavelength. For Star_2, the observed wavelength is blueshifted due to its radial velocity (\( v = 700 \, \text{km/s} \)) relative to Star_1 (\( v = 0 \, \text{km/s} \)).

The relativistic Doppler shift formula for wavelength is:

\[
\lambda_{\text{obs}} = \lambda_{\text{rest}} \sqrt{\frac{1 - \beta}{1 + \beta}}, \quad \text{where } \beta = \frac{v}{c}
\]

For \( v = 700 \, \text{km/s} \) and \( c = 3 \times 10^5 \, \text{km/s} \):

\[
\beta = \frac{700}{300,000} \approx 0.002333
\]

The Doppler factor for wavelength is:

\[
\sqrt{\frac{1 - \beta}{1 + \beta}} = \sqrt{\frac{1 - 0.002333}{1 + 0.002333}} = \sqrt{\frac{0.997667}{1.002333}} \approx 0.99766
\]

Since the observed wavelengths are the same for both stars:

\[
\lambda_{\text{rest,1}} = \lambda_{\text{obs}}, \quad \lambda_{\text{rest,2}} = \frac{\lambda_{\text{obs}}}{0.99766} \approx 1.00234 \, \lambda_{\text{obs}}
\]

From Wien's law, the temperature ratio is inversely proportional to the wavelength ratio:

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \frac{\lambda_{\text{rest,2}}}{\lambda_{\text{rest,1}}} = 1.00234
\]

Thus:

\[
\left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4 = (1.00234)^4
\]

### Step 3: Compute \( (1.00234)^4 \)
Using the approximation \( (1 + x)^4 \approx 1 + 4x \) for small \( x \):

\[
(1.00234)^4 \approx 1 + 4(0.00234) = 1 + 0.00936 = 1.00936
\]

### Step 4: Luminosity Ratio
Substitute into the luminosity ratio formula:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \times 1.00936 \approx 2.271
\]

### Step 5: Match with Options
The calculated ratio \( L_1 / L_2 \approx 2.27 \) is closest to option **B) ~2.32**, though slightly lower. Given the options, this is the most reasonable choice.

Answer: B
