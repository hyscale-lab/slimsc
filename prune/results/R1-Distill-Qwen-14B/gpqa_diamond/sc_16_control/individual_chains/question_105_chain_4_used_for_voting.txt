Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question is about a star similar to the Sun in radius. One hemisphere has dark spots covering 20% of its surface. The star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are cooler, with a temperature difference of 1000K. Because only one hemisphere is spotted, when the star rotates, the brightness as observed from Earth (or wherever) will vary periodically. This setup can mimic the presence of an exoplanet causing dips in brightness when it transits the star.

The question asks: If the star didn't have these spots, what would be the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet needed to produce the same amplitude in the star's light curve? So essentially, comparing the effect of the planet's transit to the effect of the spots.

Hmm. So I need to find Rpl/Rstar such that the dip in brightness caused by the planet is the same as the dip caused by the spots.

Let me think about how the brightness variation works in both cases.

First, when a planet transits a star, the drop in brightness is given by the area of the planet compared to the star. The formula is:

ΔF_planet = (R_planet / R_star)^2

Because the light is proportional to the area, which is πR², so when a planet covers a fraction A, the drop is A.

In the case of the star spots, the situation is a bit different. The spots are dark, so when they rotate into and out of view, they cause a dip in brightness. But their contribution is a bit more complex because they're cooler regions.

Wait, but how does the spot affect the observed brightness? Well, the star's total brightness is the sum of all the areas emitting at different temperatures. The spots are cooler, so when they're on the side facing us, they contribute less to the total light. The difference in brightness due to the spots would be based on their area and their temperature compared to the rest of the star.

So the formula for the brightness variation due to spots would involve the area of the spots and the temperature difference. Let me think.

The Stefan-Boltzmann law says that the luminosity is proportional to T^4 per unit area. So the brightness of each part of the star is (Teff^4) for the non-spots, and (Teff - ΔT)^4 for the spots.

Let me denote the star's effective temperature as T_eff = 6000K. The spots are 1000K cooler, so T_spot =5000K.

The filling factor f is 20% or 0.2. That means 20% of the hemisphere is covered by spots.

Wait, but the problem says that one hemisphere is covered with spots. So when the star rotates, the spots come into view and then go away, causing the brightness variation.

So the brightness variation caused by the spots would be the difference between when the spots are on the visible hemisphere and when they're not.

Wait, but the spots are on one hemisphere, so when the star rotates such that the spotty hemisphere is facing us, the total brightness would dip because the spots are cooler. The dip would be proportional to the area of the spots times the temperature difference.

But I'm not sure about the exact formula. Let's try to model it.

The star's total brightness is the sum of the brightness from each area element. Each area element emits according to its temperature. So when the spotty hemisphere is visible, part of the star's surface (the spots) is cooler, so the total flux is less than when the spots are on the far side.

The change in flux, ΔF_spot, would be the difference between the flux when the spots are on the near side and when they're not.

The flux from the star without any spots is F0 = σ T_eff^4 × (4π R_star²) / (4π d²) ), but perhaps it's easier to work with the relative change.

Wait, when calculating the change in brightness, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the fractional change.

The total flux from the star is F = σ T_eff^4 * (Area) / (distance squared). But when a spot is present, the area A_spot emits at a lower temperature.

So the change in flux, ΔF, would be:

ΔF = (A_spot × σ (T_spot^4 - T_eff^4)) ) / (4π R_star²)

Wait, no. Let me think again. The star's total flux is F = (σ T_eff^4) × (R_star² / d²) × (1), assuming uniform temperature. If a fraction of the area is at a lower temperature, the flux decreases.

The change in flux when the spots are visible would be the difference in flux from the spots when they are on the near side versus when they're on the far side.

So the spots contribute less when they're on the near side. The change in flux would be:

ΔF = F_spots_on_near_side - F_spots_on_far_side.

Wait, when the spots are on the far side, their flux isn't contributing to the observed brightness. So when the spots are on the near side, the observed flux is F0 - (flux from spots). When they're on the far side, the observed flux is F0. So the change would be F0 - (F0 - spot_flux) = spot_flux.

Wait, perhaps I should think of it as the difference in brightness when the spots are visible versus when they're not.

So, when the spots are fully visible, the star's flux is F = F0 - (number of spots × their area × their flux). Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute the relative change.

The star's total flux without spots is F0 = σ T_eff^4 * (π R_star²) / d², because a hemisphere is the part we can see. Wait, no, when the star rotates, we see different hemispheres, but for a star, the whole surface is visible because it's a sphere. Oh wait, no, when the star is a perfect sphere, the area we see is a hemisphere, so the total flux is F = (σ T_eff^4) * (4π R² / 4) ) / (4π d²) ) = (σ T_eff^4 R²) / (d²) × (1/4) ×4? Wait, perhaps I'm complicating it.

Alternatively, the total flux from a star is given by F = 4π R² σ T_eff^4 / (4π d²) ) = (R² σ T_eff^4) / (d²). But when a spot is present, part of the star's surface emits less.

Let me model this. The star's total flux is F = σ T_eff^4 * (R_star^2) / (d^2) * (1 - f + f (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4)) ). Wait, no, that's not right. Because the spots cover a fraction f of the area, the total flux is:

F = (1 - f) * σ T_eff^4 * (R_star^2 / d^2) * (A / 4π) ) + f * σ T_spot^4 * (R_star^2 / d^2) * (A/4π) )

Wait, perhaps I should think of the surface area as a unit of the total. So the star's surface area is 4π R². Each hemisphere has 2π R² area. But the spots cover a fraction f of the hemisphere. So the area of the spots is f * 2π R².

Wait, no, the problem says that one hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%. So the area of the spots is 0.2 * (2π R²). Wait, but maybe it's 0.2 times the area of a hemisphere? Or the area of the entire star? Hmm.

Wait, filling factor is the fraction of the surface covered. So if the entire star is considered, the filling factor f is the fraction of the total surface covered by spots. But in this problem, the spots are only on one hemisphere. So the total area of the spots is f × (2π R²) because each hemisphere is 2π R². Because a hemisphere is half the sphere, so 2π R².

So the spots are on one hemisphere, covering 20% of that hemisphere. So the area of the spots is 0.2 × 2π R² = 0.4 π R².

Wait, perhaps. Alternatively, if the filling factor is 20% of the hemisphere, then the area is 0.2 × (2π R²). So 0.4π R².

Now, when the star rotates so that the spotty hemisphere is facing us, the spots are visible. The flux from the star is then:

F_spotty = ( (1 - f) × T_eff^4 × 2π R² + f × T_spot^4 × 2π R² ) × (σ) / (4π d² )

Wait, because the visible area is 2π R², and part of that is the spots.

Alternatively, the flux from the visible hemisphere is F = [ (1 - f) × T_eff^4 + f × T_spot^4 ] × (π R² ) × σ / (4π d² ) ) × 4? Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, let's think in terms of the flux per unit area. The flux per unit area from a spot is σ T_spot^4, and from the rest of the hemisphere, it's σ T_eff^4.

The total flux from the visible hemisphere is then:

F_visible = ( (1 - f) * T_eff^4 + f * T_spot^4 ) * ( π R^2 ) * σ / (4π d² ) ) 

Wait, because the visible area is a hemisphere, which is 2π R², but wait, no: the area of a sphere is 4π R², so a hemisphere is 2π R². So the area we are considering is 2 π R².

Wait, perhaps I should model the flux as:

When the spotty hemisphere is visible, the flux is:

F = [ (1-f) * T_eff^4 * 2π R² + f * T_spot^4 * 2π R² ] * (σ) / (4π d² )

Simplify this:

F = [ 2π R² (1-f) T_eff^4 + 2π R² f T_spot^4 ] * σ / (4π d² )

Factor out 2π R²:

F = 2π R² [ (1-f) T_eff^4 + f T_spot^4 ] * σ / (4 π d² )

Simplify denominator 4 π: 2π /4π = 1/2.

So F = R² [ (1-f) T_eff^4 + f T_spot^4 ] * σ / (2 d² )

Now, the flux when the spots are not visible (i.e., the other hemisphere is facing us) is F0 = (2π R²) σ T_eff^4 / (4π d² ) ) = ( R² σ T_eff^4 )/( 2 d² )

Wait, because when the non-spotty hemisphere is visible, all the area 2π R² emits at T_eff.

So F0 = (2π R²) σ T_eff^4 / (4 π d² ) )

Simplify: 2π R²/(4 π d² ) = R²/( 2 d² )

So F0 = σ T_eff^4 R² / (2 d² )

Similarly, when the spotty hemisphere is visible, F = [ (1-f) T_eff^4 + f T_spot^4 ] * σ R² / (2 d² )

So the change in flux, ΔF, when the spots are visible is F0 - F.

ΔF = F0 - F = [ σ R²/(2 d²) ] [ T_eff^4 - ( (1-f) T_eff^4 + f T_spot^4 ) ]

Simplify the expression inside the brackets:

= T_eff^4 [ 1 - (1-f) - f (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4 ) ]
= T_eff^4 [ f (1 - T_spot^4 / T_eff^4 ) ]

So,

ΔF = [ σ R²/(2 d²) ] * T_eff^4 * f [ 1 - (T_spot/T_eff)^4 ]

The fractional change in flux is ΔF / F0.

ΔF/F0 = [ [ σ R²/(2 d²) ] * T_eff^4 * f (1 - (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4 )) ] / [ σ R² T_eff^4 / (2 d²) ) ]

Simplify: the σ, R², T_eff^4, and 2 d² terms cancel out.

So ΔF/F0 = f [ 1 - (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4) ]

That's the fractional change in brightness when the spotty hemisphere is visible.

Now, the amplitude of the brightness variation is this fractional change, since the star's brightness will dip by ΔF when the spots are in view.

In the case of a planet transiting the star, the dip in brightness is (R_planet / R_star )^2, assuming the planet covers a small area and the transit blocks light from that area. This is because the area blocked is π R_p^2, so the dip is (π R_p^2) / (4π R_star^2) ) = (R_p^2)/(4 R_star^2) ) × 4? Wait, no.

Wait, the star emits from an area of 4π R_star^2 (the whole star), but when a planet transits, it blocks a part of the star's disk (the area it's covering). So the area blocked is π (R_p)^2, assuming the planet is much smaller than the star. The fractional dip is (π R_p^2) / (4π R_star^2) ) = (R_p^2)/(4 R_star^2) ) = (R_p / (2 R_star ))^2.

Wait, wait: the star's surface area is 4π R_star². The planet's area is π R_p². So the fraction blocked is (π R_p²)/(4π R_star²) ) = R_p²/(4 R_star²) = (R_p/(2 R_star))^2.

So the dip amplitude is (R_p/(2 R_star ))^2.

In the problem, the dip amplitude due to the spots is ΔF/F0 = f [ 1 - (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4) ].

Wait, but wait, the dip due to the spots is when the spots are in view. So the amplitude of the brightness variation would correspond to this fractional change.

But the problem states that the photometric time-series will show periodic variations in brightness due to rotational modulation. But in the case of an exoplanet, the dip is only when the planet transits, which is a single sharp dip, not a periodic variation. Hmm, but the question says that the situation can resemble an exoplanet — probably because the brightness changes have a similar shape, but the star's spots lead to a periodic dimming and brightening as the star rotates.

Wait, but the question is about the amplitude of the brightness variation, not the shape. So regardless of the cause, the amplitude should match.

So the amplitude from the spots is ΔF_spot = f [ 1 - (T_spot / T_eff )^4 ].

Wait, but wait in our calculation earlier, the fractional change is f [1 - (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4 ) ].

So, setting the amplitude from the planet transit dip equal to the amplitude from the spots:

(R_p / (2 R_star))^2 = f [ 1 - (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4 ) ]

Wait, but wait, let me make sure that the dip from the planet is (R_p/(2 R_star))^2? Because when the planet transits, it covers an area of π R_p^2, and the star's area is 4π R_star^2, so the fraction is π R_p^2 / 4π R_star^2 = (R_p^2)/(4 R_star^2) = (R_p/(2 R_star))^2.

Yes. So the dip is (R_p/(2 R_star))^2.

Setting this equal to the fractional dip from the spots:

(R_p/(2 R_star))^2 = f [ 1 - (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4 ) ]

We can solve for R_p / R_star.

Let me compute the right-hand side first.

Given:

f = 0.2 (20% filling factor)

T_spot = 6000K - 1000K = 5000K.

T_eff = 6000K.

So,

RHS = 0.2 * [1 - (5000/6000)^4 ]

Compute (5000/6000) = 5/6 ≈ 0.833333.

(5/6)^4 = (625)/(1296) ≈ 0.48225.

So,

1 - 0.48225 ≈ 0.51775.

Multiply by 0.2: 0.2 * 0.51775 ≈ 0.10355.

So,

(R_p/(2 R_star))^2 = 0.10355.

Take square root of both sides:

R_p/(2 R_star) = sqrt(0.10355) ≈ 0.3218.

So,

R_p = 0.3218 * 2 R_star ≈ 0.6436 R_star.

Wait, that can't be right because the options are much smaller.

Wait, wait a minute. Maybe I'm getting the equation wrong. Because the dip from the planet is (R_p/(R_star))^2, not (R_p/(2 R_star))^2.

Wait, no. The star's area is 4π R_star^2, and the planet blocks π R_p^2. So the dip is (π R_p^2)/(4 π R_star^2) )= R_p^2/(4 R_star^2) = (R_p/(2 R_star))^2.

So the amplitude is (R_p/(2 R_star))².

Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the earlier analysis. Let me re-express.

The dip from the planet is the area blocked divided by the total star area. So it's (π R_p²) / (4π R_star²) ) = (R_p^2)/(4 R_star²) = (R_p/(2 R_star))².

The dip from the spots is the fractional change in flux when the spots are visible, which is f*(1 - (T_spot/T_eff)^4 ).

Wait, but earlier I calculated that the fractional change is f*(1 - (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4 )).

So the equation is:

(R_p/(2 R_star))² = f*(1 - (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4 )).

But the problem says that the planet's transit would produce the same amplitude as the spots. So:

(R_p/(2 R_star))² = 0.2*(1 - (5000/6000)^4 )

Which we computed as 0.2*(1 - (0.8333)^4 ) ≈ 0.2*0.51775 ≈ 0.10355.

So (R_p/(2 R_star))² = 0.10355.

Taking the square root:

R_p/(2 R_star) = sqrt(0.10355) ≈ 0.3218.

So R_p = 0.3218 * 2 R_star ≈ 0.6436 R_star.

Wait, that would be a planet radius of about 64% of the star's radius. But that's way larger than the options given, which are all around 0.07 to about 0.39. So clearly I must have made a mistake in my approach.

Hmm. Let's think again.

Wait a moment, perhaps I mixed up the flux calculation. Let me re-express the problem.

When the star is unspotted, the flux is F0 = σ T_eff^4 (R_star^2) / (d^2) * (1/(4)) ), because the flux from a star is L/(4π d²), and L is 4π R² σ T^4. So F0 = (4 π R² σ T^4) / (4 π d²) ) = (R² σ T^4 )/(d²).

Wait, but when part of the star is cooler, the flux drops. So when the spots are visible, the flux is F = F0 - (f * (T_eff^4 - T_spot^4 )) * (R² σ)/(d²) ) × (area fraction).

Wait, perhaps I should model the flux as:

Flux when spots are visible: F = F0 - f * (T_eff^4 - T_spot^4 ) * (R^2 σ)/(4 d^2) )

Wait, no, perhaps I'm complicating things.

Alternative approach: the flux from the star is proportional to the sum of the areas each emitting at their respective temperatures.

The star's total flux when the spots are visible is:

F_visible = [ (1 - f) * T_eff^4 + f * T_spot^4 ] * (R^2) * σ / (4 d^2) ) * 4 (since the entire star's surface is considered, but when viewed, we see a hemisphere.)

Wait, no. The star is a sphere, so when we observe it, we see a hemisphere. The spots are on one hemisphere, so when that hemisphere is facing us, the flux is:

F_visible = [ (1-f) * T_eff^4 + f * T_spot^4 ] * (2 π R²) * σ / (4 π d² )

Simplify:

F_visible = [ (1-f) T_eff^4 + f T_spot^4 ] * (2 π R² σ) / (4 π d² )

= [ (1-f) T_eff^4 + f T_spot^4 ] * R² σ / (2 d² )

The normal flux (no spots visible) is F0 = T_eff^4 * (2 π R² σ) / (4 π d² )

= (2 π R² σ T_eff^4 )/(4 π d² )

= R² σ T_eff^4 / (2 d² )

So the change in flux is F0 - F_visible = (R² σ)/(2 d² ) [ T_eff^4 - ( (1-f) T_eff^4 + f T_spot^4 ) ]

= (R² σ)/(2 d² ) [ T_eff^4 * (1 - (1-f) ) - f T_spot^4 ]

= (R² σ)/(2 d² ) [ f T_eff^4 - f T_spot^4 ]

= (R² σ f )/(2 d² ) [ T_eff^4 - T_spot^4 ]

So the fractional change is (F0 - F_visible)/F0 = [ (R² σ f (T_eff^4 - T_spot^4 ) )/(2 d² ) ] / [ R² σ T_eff^4 / (2 d² ) ]

Simplify: (f (T_eff^4 - T_spot^4 )) / T_eff^4

= f [1 - (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4 ) ]

So this brings me back to the same result as before: the fractional change is f (1 - (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4 )).

So the dip from the spots is 0.2 * (1 - (5000/6000)^4 ) ≈ 0.10355.

So the dip from the planet is (R_p/(2 R_star))^2 = 0.10355.

Wait, but that would require R_p/(2 R_star) ≈ sqrt(0.10355) ≈ 0.3218.

So R_p = 0.6436 R_star.

But none of the options are around 0.64. The options are A) ~0.39, B) ~0.07, C) ~0.11, D) ~0.32.

Hmm, clearly something is wrong here. Let me reevaluate.

Wait, perhaps I've misunderstood the filling factor. The problem says one hemisphere is covered with spots with a filling factor of 20%. So the spots cover 20% of the entire star's surface, not just the hemisphere.

Wait, that makes a big difference.

Wait, if the filling factor is 20% for the entire star, then the area of spots is 0.2 * 4π R^2. But wait, no, the filling factor is the fraction of the surface covered. So if the entire star is considered, and the spots are on one hemisphere, the filling factor is 20% of the entire star's surface.

Wait, if the entire star's surface area is 4π R^2, and one hemisphere (2π R^2) has 20% of that, then the area of the spots is 0.2 *4π R^2? No, that can't be, because one hemisphere is 2π R², and 20% of the entire star would be 0.8π R². So the area of the spots would be 0.8 π R², spread over the 2π R² of the hemisphere. So the fraction of the hemisphere covered by spots is (0.8 π R² ) / (2 π R² ) ) = 0.4, or 40% coverage on the hemisphere.

Wait, but the problem says that one hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%—that suggests that the spots cover 20% of the hemisphere. So the area of the spots is 0.2 * (2π R²) ) = 0.4 π R².

Wait, perhaps I was correct the first time. So then f (filling factor) in the formula is 0.2.

But that leads to the planet's radius being 64% of the star's radius, which is not among the options.

So I must have a mistake in the approach.

Alternative approach: perhaps the star's brightness variation is modeled differently. Wait, when the star has spots, the variation in brightness is due to the spots rotating into and out of view. The amplitude is the difference between the maximum and minimum brightness.

Wait, perhaps the maximum brightness is when the non-spotty hemisphere is facing us, and the minimum is when the spotty hemisphere is facing us.

So the maximum flux is F0 = (2π R²) σ T_eff^4 / (4 π d²) ) = ( R² σ T_eff^4 )/(2 d² )

The minimum flux is when the spotty hemisphere is facing us: F_visible = [ (2π R² (1-f)) * σ T_eff^4 + 2π R² f σ T_spot^4 ] / (4 π d² )

Simplify:

F_visible = [ (1-f) T_eff^4 + f T_spot^4 ] * (2 π R² σ ) / (4 π d² )

= [ (1-f) T_eff^4 + f T_spot^4 ] * R² σ / (2 d² )

So the difference between F0 and F_visible is F0 - F_visible = [ T_eff^4 - ( (1-f) T_eff^4 + f T_spot^4 ) ] * (R² σ )/(2 d² )

= [ f T_eff^4 (1) - f T_spot^4 ] * (R² σ )/(2 d² )

= f ( T_eff^4 - T_spot^4 ) * ( R² σ )/(2 d² )

So the fractional change is [ f ( T_eff^4 - T_spot^4 ) * ( R² σ )/(2 d² ) ] / [ R² σ T_eff^4/(2 d² ) ] = f ( 1 - (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4 ) )

This brings me back to the same result as before.

So the fractional dip is 0.2 * (1 - (5000^4 / 6000^4 )) ≈ 0.2*(1 - (0.8333)^4 ) ≈ 0.2*(1-0.48225)= 0.2 *0.51775= ~0.10355.

So the dip is about 10.355% of the star's brightness.

But for the planet, the dip is (R_p/(2 R_star))^2.

So (R_p/(2 R_star))^2 = 0.10355.

So R_p/(2 R_star) = sqrt(0.10355) ≈ 0.3218.

So R_p = 2 * 0.3218 R_star ≈ 0.6436 R_star.

But the options don't have anything close to that. So either I'm making a mistake in the approach, or the question is about something different.

Alternative possibility: perhaps the star spots cause a larger dip than I'm calculating, but that would require considering that the star's rotation makes the spots appear as a larger area.

Wait, another thought: when the star is viewed, the spots rotate in and out of view. The maximum dip occurs when the spotty hemisphere is facing us, and the minimum when the non-spotty is visible. So the amplitude is the difference between F0 (no spots visible) and F_visible (spots visible).

But perhaps I should model the spots as covering a larger area when the star is viewed edge-on. Because when the star is viewed from the side, the spots would cover a larger apparent area. Hmm, but the problem states that the star's radius is the same as the Sun's, and the observation is from Earth, so perhaps we are viewing the star as a disk, and the spots are on one hemisphere.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the spots are in one hemisphere, so when the star rotates, the spots come into view for a certain period, causing a dip in brightness. The amplitude of the dip is the same as the planet's transit dip.

Wait, but the problem states: to produce the same amplitude signal in the star's light curve. So the maximum dip from the spots should be equal to the maximum dip from the planet.

But the planet's dip is (R_p/R_star)^2, not (R_p/(2 R_star))^2.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the planet transit calculation.

In the planet transit scenario, the dip is (R_p^2)/(R_star^2), because the area blocked is π R_p^2, and the area of the star is π R_star^2 (since we're considering the area as seen from Earth, which is a disk with area π R_star^2).

Wait, this is where I think I went wrong earlier. Let me clarify.

The star's area as seen from Earth is a circle with radius R_star. The planet's area is a circle with radius R_p. So when the planet transits, it blocks an area of π R_p^2. The fractional dip is (π R_p^2 ) / (π R_star^2 ) = (R_p/R_star )^2.

Ah! So the dip is (R_p/R_star )^2.

Earlier, I thought the dip was (R_p/(2 R_star ))^2, which was incorrect. Because the area of the star's disk is π R_star^2, not 4π R_star². So the correct dip is (R_p/R_star )^2.

So that changes everything. Let me reevaluate.

The dip from the planet is (R_p/R_star )^2.

The dip from the spots is f [1 - (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4 ) ].

So:

(R_p/R_star )^2 = 0.2 * [1 - (5000/6000 )^4 ]

Which is 0.2 * [1 - (0.8333)^4 ] ≈ 0.2 * [1 - 0.48225] ≈ 0.2 * 0.51775 ≈ 0.10355.

So R_p/R_star = sqrt(0.10355) ≈ 0.3218, approximately 0.32.

Looking at the options, option D is 0.32.

So the correct answer should be D) ~0.32.

To determine the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation as the star's dark spots, we compare the fractional changes in brightness caused by the planet and the spots.

1. **Brightness Variation Due to Spots**:
   - The star has an effective temperature \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \), and the spots are cooler with \( T_{\text{spot}} = 5000 \, \text{K} \).
   - The filling factor \( f \) is 20% (0.2), meaning 20% of the star's surface is covered by spots.
   - The fractional change in brightness due to the spots is given by:
     \[
     \Delta F_{\text{spot}} = f \left[ 1 - \left( \frac{T_{\text{spot}}}{T_{\text{eff}}} \right)^4 \right]
     \]
   - Substituting the values:
     \[
     \Delta F_{\text{spot}} = 0.2 \left[ 1 - \left( \frac{5000}{6000} \right)^4 \right]
     \]
     \[
     \Delta F_{\text{spot}} = 0.2 \left[ 1 - \left( 0.8333 \right)^4 \right]
     \]
     \[
     \Delta F_{\text{spot}} = 0.2 \left[ 1 - 0.48225 \right] = 0.2 \times 0.51775 = 0.10355
     \]

2. **Brightness Variation Due to a Planet**:
   - The fractional change in brightness during a planetary transit is proportional to the square of the ratio of the planet's radius to the star's radius:
     \[
     \Delta F_{\text{planet}} = \left( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2
     \]
   - To match the amplitude of the brightness variation caused by the spots, we set:
     \[
     \left( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2 = \Delta F_{\text{spot}} = 0.10355
     \]
   - Solving for \( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \):
     \[
     \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} = \sqrt{0.10355} \approx 0.3218
     \]

3. **Comparison with Options**:
   - The calculated value \( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \approx 0.32 \) matches option **D**.

### Conclusion:
The radius of the hypothetical exoplanet, relative to the star, is approximately **0.32**.
