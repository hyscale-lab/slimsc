Okay, so I've got this question about density matrices and their geometrical positions in qubit space. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The given density matrix is rho equals (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). Wait, that looks familiar. I remember that a density matrix represents the state of a quantum system, especially when it's mixed. Pure states are density matrices with trace 1 and rank 1, but this one seems different.

Let me compute what this rho actually is. So |0><0| is a matrix that's 1 in the (0,0) position and 0 elsewhere. Similarly, |1><1| is 1 in (1,1). So adding them together, we get a 2x2 diagonal matrix with 1s on the diagonal. Then multiply by 1/2. So each diagonal element becomes 1/2, and the off-diagonal elements are 0. So rho is a diagonal matrix [[1/2, 0],[0, 1/2]].

Wait, that's interesting. So rho is a diagonal matrix with both diagonal elements equal to 1/2. That makes me think it's a completely mixed state, right? Because a pure state would have one of the diagonal elements as 1 and the other as 0. For example, |0><0| is pure, as is |1><1|. But this is a mixture of both with equal probabilities.

Now, the question is about its geometrical position in qubit space. I'm trying to remember how density matrices are represented geometrically. I think in the Bloch sphere representation, which is used for single qubits. The Bloch sphere is a way to visualize qubit states, where pure states are points on the surface and mixed states are inside.

Wait, but how is the density matrix mapped to the Bloch sphere? I recall that a density matrix for a single qubit can be written in terms of the Bloch vector. The general form is rho = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices and r is a vector in 3D space with components (x,y,z), and |r| <=1.

So let me expand that. The Pauli matrices are:

σ_x = [[0,1],[1,0]]
σ_y = [[0,-i],[i,0]]
σ_z = [[1,0],[0,-1]]

So the general form is (I/2) + (x σ_x + y σ_y + z σ_z)/2.

Our given rho is [[1/2, 0],[0,1/2]]. Let's write that out:

rho = [[(1/2), 0], [0, (1/2)]]

Comparing this to the general form, which is:

rho = (I + r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z ) / 2.

Wait, no. Wait, the general form is (I + sum(r_i σ_i )) / 2.

So I'll expand this:

rho = (I + r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z ) / 2.

Let me compute this:

I is [[1,0],[0,1]], so I/2 is [[1/2, 0],[0,1/2]].

Then, r_x σ_x is r_x [[0,1],[1,0]] → [[0, r_x],[r_x, 0]]/2.

Similarly, r_y σ_y is r_y [[0,-i],[i,0]] → [[0, -i r_y],[i r_y, 0]]/2.

r_z σ_z is r_z [[1,0],[0,-1]] → [[r_z, 0],[0, -r_z]]/2.

Adding all these together:

rho = (I + sum terms ) / 2 = (I/2) + (r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z ) / 2.

So putting it all together:

rho = (I/2) + (r_x σ_x )/2 + (r_y σ_y )/2 + (r_z σ_z )/2.

Now, let's compute each term.

First term: I/2 gives us [[1/2, 0], [0,1/2]].

Second term: (σ_x r_x)/2 → [[0, r_x/2], [r_x/2, 0]].

Third term: (σ_y r_y)/2 → [[0, (-i r_y)/2], [i r_y/2, 0]].

Fourth term: (σ_z r_z)/2 → [[r_z/2, 0], [0, (-r_z)/2]].

Adding all these matrices together:

rho = [[1/2 + r_z/2, (r_x - i r_y)/2], [ (r_x + i r_y)/2, 1/2 - r_z/2 ] ].

Wait, combining the terms:

The (1,1) component is 1/2 + r_z/2.

The (1,2) component is (r_x/2 - i r_y/2) → (r_x - i r_y)/2.

Similarly, the (2,1) component is (r_x + i r_y)/2.

The (2,2) component is 1/2 - r_z/2.

So our given rho is [[1/2, 0], [0, 1/2]]. Comparing this to the general form, let's set the components equal.

So, the (1,1) component is 1/2 + (r_z)/2 = 1/2 → (r_z)/2 = 0 → r_z = 0.

The (1,2) component is (r_x - i r_y)/2 = 0 → r_x - i r_y = 0 → r_x = 0 and r_y =0? Because the only way a complex number is zero is if both real and imaginary parts are zero. So r_x =0 and r_y=0.

Similarly, the (2,2) component is 1/2 - (r_z)/2 =1/2 → -(r_z)/2=0 → r_z=0 again, which is consistent.

So all the components of r are zero. So the Bloch vector r is (0,0,0).

Wait, but what does that mean? A Bloch vector at the origin corresponds to the completely mixed state, which makes sense because this rho is (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2, a maximally mixed state. That's the state that can't be distinguished from being in either state, so it's the center of the Bloch sphere, hence r=(0,0,0).

Looking at the options, option C is (0,0,0). So the answer should be C.

The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( |0\rangle \langle 0| + |1\rangle \langle 1| \right).
\]

This is a diagonal matrix with equal probabilities of \( \frac{1}{2} \) for both the \( |0\rangle \) and \( |1\rangle \) states. This represents a maximally mixed state, which corresponds to the center of the Bloch sphere in the qubit space.

To analyze the geometrical position, the Bloch sphere representation is used, where a single-qubit density matrix can be expressed as:

\[
\rho = \frac{I}{2} + \frac{\mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}}{2},
\]

where \( I \) is the identity matrix, \( \boldsymbol{\sigma} = (\sigma_x, \sigma_y, \sigma_z) \) are the Pauli matrices, and \( \mathbf{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z) \) is a vector in 3D space with \( |\mathbf{r}| \leq 1 \). Expanding this, the general form of \( \rho \) is:

\[
\rho = \begin{bmatrix}
\frac{1}{2} + \frac{r_z}{2} & \frac{r_x - i r_y}{2} \\
\frac{r_x + i r_y}{2} & \frac{1}{2} - \frac{r_z}{2}
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

Comparing this with the given \( \rho = \frac{1}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} \), we see that:

1. The (1,1) component gives \( \frac{1}{2} + \frac{r_z}{2} = \frac{1}{2} \), implying \( r_z = 0 \).
2. The (1,2) component gives \( \frac{r_x - i r_y}{2} = 0 \), which implies \( r_x = 0 \) and \( r_y = 0 \).
3. The (2,2) component confirms \( \frac{1}{2} - \frac{r_z}{2} = \frac{1}{2} \), consistent with \( r_z = 0 \).

Thus, the Bloch vector \( \mathbf{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z) \) is \( (0, 0, 0) \), corresponding to the origin in the Bloch sphere. This is consistent with the given density matrix representing a maximally mixed state.

From the options provided:

- **A)** \( (1,1,0) \): Incorrect, as this corresponds to a pure state.
- **B)** \( (0,0,1) \): Incorrect, as this corresponds to a pure state.
- **C)** \( (0,0,0) \): Correct, as this corresponds to the maximally mixed state.
- **D)** \( (1,1,1) \): Incorrect, as this is not a valid Bloch vector.

The correct answer is **C**, \( (0,0,0) \).
