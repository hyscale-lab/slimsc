Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, the question is about identifying a compound based on its IR and NMR data, and then predicting the product when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I've heard that red phosphorus and HI are usually involved in some kind of substitution reaction, maybe something like a hydrolysis or a dehydrohalogenation? Wait, no, I think red phosphorus and HI are used for the hydrolysis of nitriles into amines, but wait, no, I'm mixing things up. Oh right, maybe it's about the removal of a leaving group. Or perhaps it's a diels-alder reaction? Hmm, not sure yet. Let me start by analyzing the given data.

So the compound is X, and we have its IR and NMR. Let me break down the IR first. The IR peaks are at 3400–2500 cm-1, which usually indicates O-H or N-H stretches. But 3400 is more like a broad peak, possibly from an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. The peak at 1720 is strong and suggests a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid. The 1610 and 1450 cm-1 peaks might be aromatic C=C stretches. So the compound probably has an aromatic ring and a carbonyl group.

Looking at the NMR data. The 1H NMR shows:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): That's a broad singlet. Aromatic protons usually don't go that high. Oh wait, maybe it's an aldehyde proton? But aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10 ppm as a singlet. Or could it be a carboxylic acid proton? Carboxylic acids have protons around 10-12 ppm and are usually broad because of the exchange with water. So the 10.5 ppm peak is probably a COOH proton.

Then, 8.0 ppm (d, 2H): This looks like two aromatic protons as a doublet. Similarly, 7.2 ppm (d, 2H) could be another set of aromatic protons. So this suggests a para-substituted benzene ring. Like two substituents on opposite positions.

Looking at the other NMR peaks:

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): A multiplet integrating to 1H. Maybe a CH adjacent to something else, like an oxygen or a carbonyl. Like a CH2 group next to a carbonyl? Or maybe a CH in a branch.

- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): Another multiplet, integrating to 2H. Could be a CH2 group in a chain, perhaps next to an electron-withdrawing group.

- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): A doublet of 3H. That's probably a methyl group attached to something, like a CH. So maybe a CH(CH3) group. Because a doublet for a methyl would suggest it's on a CH.

- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): A triplet, 3H. That's a terminal methyl group, likely from an ethyl chain, like CH2CH3.

Putting this together, the aromatic ring is para-substituted. So substituents are in positions 1 and 4. Wait, no, para is 1 and 4? Or 2 and 5? Wait, no, para is 1,4. So if the substituents are in para, then the substituents are on positions 1 and 4. Wait, but the NMR shows four aromatic protons, two doublets. So maybe two substituents on the ring, each with two protons. Like if the substituents are each a group that's de-shielded, perhaps.

Wait, if the aromatic protons are at 8.0 and 7.2, the substituents are likely electron-withdrawing groups. Because the deshielded protons (higher ppm) are next to substituents. So if substituent A is in position 1, and substituent B in position 4, the adjacent protons would be deshielded.

Wait, let me think about the NMR splitting. The two doublets each have 2H. So maybe the substituents are in positions 1 and 4, each with two adjacent protons. For example, if substituent A is in position 1, the adjacent H would be in positions 2 and 6, and substituent B in position 4, adjacent to positions 3 and 5.

Wait, but a para-substituted benzene would have two substituents opposite each other. So if substituent A is at position 1, substituent B is at position 4. The aromatic protons would be at positions 2,3,5,6. If substituents A and B are electron-withdrawing, then the protons ortho to them (like 2 and 6 for substituent A, and 3 and 5 for substituent B) might be deshielded, appearing as doublets.

Wait, but in the NMR, the two doublets each have two H. So that makes sense. For example, substituent A is at position 1, causing the H at 2 and 6 to be deshielded, and substituent B at position 4 causing H at 3 and 5 to be deshielded. But their chemical shifts would differ based on the substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are such that the ring has two substituents, each in the para position relative to each other, leading to a pattern where two pairs of protons are each a doublet.

But wait, let's think about the substituent possibilities. The IR shows a carbonyl at 1720 cm-1. That could be a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid. But earlier, the 10.5 ppm peak suggests a carboxylic acid proton. So the compound likely has a carboxylic acid group attached to the ring.

So, if substituent A is a carboxylic acid group at position 1, and substituent B is another group at position 4. Let's think about substituent B's structure based on the NMR.

The substituent B is attached to the ring. From the NMR, the non-aromatic regions show a CH group (2.9 ppm, 1H), CH2 (1.7 ppm, 2H), a CH(CH3) (1.4 ppm, 3H as doublet), and a CH2CH3 (0.9 ppm, triplet). So maybe substituent B is a chain like CH2CH2CH(CH3), but wait:

Wait, the substituent would be connected to the ring. Let me see. The substituent starts at the ring and has a chain. The NMR has a CH group (2.9 ppm), which is a CH connected to something else. Then, a CH2 group (1.7 ppm), then another CH (from 1.4 ppm), and then a CH2CH3 (0.9 ppm).

Wait, perhaps substituent B is a propyl group but with branching. Let me think: The substituent could be a butyl group. Let's see the substituent is -(CH2)n-something.

Looking at the NMR:

- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): That's a terminal methyl, so it's probably at the end of a chain, like CH2CH3.

- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): This is likely a CH2 group adjacent to another CH2 or a CH.

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): This could be a CH group adjacent to a carbonyl or something else.

- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): A methyl group attached to a CH, so maybe a CH(CH3).

Putting that together, perhaps substituent B is a chain like CH2CH(CH3)CH2CH3? No, wait, that would have more protons. Alternatively, substituent B is a pentyl or similar. Wait, maybe it's a sec-butyl group. Let me think: sec-butyl is CH2CH(CH2CH3). Wait, no, the substituent would be attached to the ring as R.

Wait, let's build the substituent step by step. The substituent starts at the ring and has a structure like:

Ring—CH2—CH(CH3)—CH2—CH3?

No, because that would be a 4-methylpentyl or something. Alternatively, maybe it's a propyl group attached to a CH(CH3). Wait, perhaps substituent B is a butyl group where the chain is something like CH2CH(CH3)— attached to the ring. Wait, let me think about the structure again.

Wait, the substituent attached to the ring has certain characteristics. The substituent's protons are as follows:

- The CH(CH3) group: 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) suggests that the CH is attached to the methyl, and the CH is next to another CH or CH2.

- The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) is the CH that's attached to the CH(CH3).

- The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) are the CH2 protons adjacent to the CH.

- The 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) is the terminal methyl.

So, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3 group? No, that's a pentyl group, but wait:

Wait, substituent could be: 

Ring—CH2—CH(CH3)—CH2—CH3.

But that would have a longer chain. Let's count the carbons. Wait, if the substituent is a pentyl group, but perhaps it's a isobutyl group. Let me think: Isobutyl is -CH2CH(CH3)2. Wait, no, that's tert-butyl. Isobutyl is CH2CH2CH(CH3)— no, wait, isobutyl is CH2CH(CH2CH3)— no, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps substituent B is a propyl group with a branch. Let me think: if the substituent is -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, that's a pentyl group but that may not fit the NMR data.

Wait, looking again: The substituent's NMR has 1H at 2.9 ppm (m), which is a CH group. Then 2H at 1.7 ppm (m), which is a CH2. Then 3H at 1.4 (d, so adjacent to a CH), and 3H at 0.9 (t, which would be a CH2CH3 group). So the substituent is likely a chain like:

Ring—CH2—CH(CH3)—CH2—CH3.

Wait, but that would be a pentyl group, but perhaps part of the structure is a branch.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a butyl group with a branch. Let me visualize: if the substituent is -(CH2)m-CH(CH3)-..., where m is 1 or 2.

Alternatively, the substituent could be a propyl group attached to a CH(CH3), making it a branched chain. So, substituent B is -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2CH3? No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a sec-butyl group. Let me think: sec-butyl is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-. Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me get this straight.

Butyl groups can be:

- n-butyl: CH2CH2CH2CH3 (but that's a straight chain)
- iso-butyl: CH2CH(CH3)CH2 (but wait, that's actually (CH3)2CHCH2-)
Wait, no. Let me recall: iso-butyl is -(CH2)2CH(CH3)-. Wait, no, iso-butyl is CH2CH(CH2CH3)-? No, I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a methyl branch. So, substituent B is -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2CH3? Hmm, that would be a 4-methylpentyl group, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a pentyl group with a branch, but that might complicate things.

Wait, perhaps it's a propyl group attached to a CH(CH3). Let me try to draw it:

The substituent would be: CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3.

Wait, but that would require four carbons from the ring. Let me count the substituent's Hs.

Wait, the substituent's NMR peaks:

- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): terminal CH3. So, (CH2)n-CH2-CH3.

- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): the CH2 adjacent to the CH(CH3) group.

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): the CH connected to the CH3.

- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): the methyl attached to the CH.

So, substituent B is: CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3.

Wait, that's a pentyl group, but perhaps it's arranged as a branch. Wait, no, that would be a four-carbon substituent attached to the ring.

Wait, maybe substituent B is a -CH2CH(CH3)2 group? Wait, that's a tertiary butyl group. No, because the NMR has a triplet at 0.9, which is a terminal methyl, so perhaps the substituent is a propyl group attached to a CH(CH3).

Wait, perhaps the substituent is -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. No, that can't be, because that would have more protons than the NMR suggests.

Alternatively, substituent B is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, perhaps substituent B is a sec-butyl group. Wait, what's a sec-butyl group? The structure is CH2CH(CH3)2? No, that's not right. Oh wait, no. A sec-butyl group is when the substituent is attached to the second carbon of butane. So it's CH2CH(CH3)CH2-, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the NMR again:

The non-aromatic region has:

- 1H at 2.9 ppm (m): likely a CH adjacent to an electronegative group, perhaps a carbonyl.

- 2H at 1.7 ppm (m): CH2 adjacent to another CH.

- 3H at 1.4 ppm (d): CH attached to a CH3.

- 3H at 0.9 ppm (t): CH2CH3.

So, putting this all together: the substituent is a chain that starts with a CH2, then a CH connected to a methyl group, then another CH2, and ends with a CH3.

Wait, that would be: CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3.

So the substituent is a pentyl group? Wait, but that's a four-carbon chain. Let me count: from the ring, it's CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. That's four carbons (ring CH2, then CH(CH3), then CH2, then CH3). So substituent is -(CH2)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3.

Wait, that's a four-carbon substituent, but actually, the chain is CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, which is a four-carbon substituent. Wait, but the NMR has protons for 1H (CH), 2H (CH2), 3H (CH3), and another 3H (CH2CH3). So the substituent is a butyl group with a branch.

Wait, perhaps it's a iso-butyl group. Let's see: iso-butyl is -(CH2)CH(CH3)2. No, that's a tertiary butyl group. Wait, no. Iso-butyl is CH2CH(CH3)CH2-? No, wait, iso-butyl is -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2-, but that's not correct. I'm getting a bit tangled here.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a methyl branch. So: CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Wait, that's a four-carbon substituent, but the NMR doesn't add up. Alternatively, perhaps substituent B is a butyl group with a methyl branch at the second carbon.

Wait, another approach: let's consider what the substituent B's structure would be to give those NMR signals.

- The 0.9 ppm triplet suggests a CH2CH3 group.

- The 1.7 ppm multiplet (CH2) is next to a CH that's connected to a methyl.

- The 2.9 ppm (CH) is attached to a CH3 (1.4 ppm doublet) and a CH2 (1.7 ppm).

So the substituent B would be: CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. But that's a four-carbon chain, which would be a pentyl group if the ring is attached to the first carbon. Wait, that would make the substituent a pentyl group. Alternatively, perhaps substituent B is a propyl group attached to a CH(CH3).

Wait, but that's getting complicated. Let me think about the overall structure.

The molecule has a benzene ring with two substituents: a carboxylic acid group (from the IR and NMR) and another group that's a branched alkyl chain. The substituent from the alkyl chain is attached in the para position relative to the carboxylic acid.

So the structure is likely para-substituted with a COOH group and a branched alkyl group.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid. Wait, that's a phenyl group with substituents at position 2 and 4? Or wait, no, the formula is 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid. Wait, that would be a propanoic acid attached to a benzene ring which has an ethyl group at position 4. So the substituents are at positions 2 and 4? Not sure.

Option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So benzoic acid (COOH at position 1) and a sec-butyl group at position 4. That would make sense because the substituents are para to each other.

Option D: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. That's a toluene derivative with substituents at 1 and 4. But the NMR suggests a COOH proton, so this might not fit.

Wait, the given options:

A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid. So the structure is a phenyl ring with substituents at position 2 (propanoic acid) and position 4 (ethyl group). But the NMR data suggests a para-substituted ring with COOH and another group. But in the NMR, the aromatic protons are split into two doublets, which would make sense if substituents are para.

But in option A, substituents are at 2 and 4, which are meta to each other, not para. So that would lead to different NMR signals than what's observed.

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So COOH is at position 1, and the substituent is at position 4. So the substituents are para.

So the structure would be:

COOH (position 1), and a sec-butyl group at position 4.

Wait, but what's a sec-butyl group? Let me think: sec-butyl is CH2CH(CH3)2? No, wait. Wait, the structure of sec-butyl is CH2CH(CH3)CH2-. Wait, no, that's a four-carbon group.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a isobutyl group, which is CH2CH(CH3)2. No, that's a tertiary butyl group.

Wait, let me get this straight. A sec-butyl group is a four-carbon substituent where the attachment is to the second carbon. So it's -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2-? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, I think I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again.

A butyl group can be:

- n-butyl: -CH2CH2CH2CH3.

- iso-butyl: -CH(CH3)CH2CH3.

Wait, no, iso-butyl is when the substituent is attached to the second carbon of a four-carbon chain. So the structure is CH2CH(CH3)CH2CH3? No, that's longer than four carbons. Maybe I should think of it as:

The substituent is: CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- (attached to the ring). So the substituent is -(CH2)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. That is, the substituent is a pentyl group with a methyl branch. But I'm not sure if that's correct.

Alternatively, the substituent is a butyl group with a branch on the second carbon, making it a sec-butyl group. So the structure would be -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2-.

Wait, but that would be a four-carbon substituent. Let me count:

- The substituent is attached to the ring at the first carbon.

- Then we have CH2 (carbon 2), then CH(CH3) (carbon 3), then CH2 (carbon 4), and then a CH3 (carbon 5). Wait, that's five carbons, which isn't possible, because butyl is four.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me look at the options again.

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

So the benzoic acid is at position 1, and the substituent is a sec-butyl group at position 4. The sec-butyl group would be: the substituent is attached to the second carbon of a butyl chain.

Wait, but that would mean the structure is:

Benzoic acid (COOH at position 1), substituent at position 4: -(CH2)CH(CH3)2. Wait, that would be a tertiary butyl group, not a sec-butyl.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think of the substituent as a branch on the second carbon. So the substituent is: -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2- attached to the ring. Wait, but that's four carbons if it's a butyl group.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a methyl branch on the second carbon. So the substituent would be -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2-CH3. No, that's five carbons. I'm getting a bit stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps substituent B is a isobutyl group, which is -(CH2)CH(CH3)2. No, that's a tertiary butyl group.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group attached to a CH(CH3). So the substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2CH3. That would mean substituent B is a pentyl group with a branch.

But I'm not sure. Let me instead think about how the substituent's NMR fits the structure.

The substituent's NMR:

- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): this is the end of a chain, so a CH2CH3 group.

- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): adjacent to a CH.

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): adjacent to a CH(CH3).

- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): CH(CH3).

So the chain goes: CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, that would have more Hs. Wait, perhaps substituent B is a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- group attached to the ring. Then, the substituent would be a propyl group with a branch, but that might not fit.

Alternatively, substituent B is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3)- group attached to the ring. No, that's getting too complicated.

Wait, perhaps substituent B is a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- group. So the structure is:

Ring—CH2—CH(CH3)—CH2—CH3.

Wait, but that's four carbons: ring, CH2, CH(CH3), CH2, CH3. Wait, that's five carbons, which would make it a pentyl group, but the substituent is a butyl group. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: let's consider the options and see which ones fit the data.

Option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

The structure would be:

Benzoic acid (COOH at position 1), and a sec-butyl group at position 4.

So, the substituent is attached at position 4, and the substituent is a sec-butyl group. So the substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2- attached to the ring? No, wait, the substituent would be a butyl group where the attachment is on the second carbon.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2- group. But that's a four-carbon group, so it would be a butyl group with a branch.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -(CH2)CH(CH3)2 group, which is a tertiary butyl group. But then the NMR would have different peaks.

Wait, but looking at the NMR data for substituent B:

- The 0.9 ppm triplet suggests a CH2CH3 group.

- The 1.7 ppm multiplet is a CH2 next to a CH.

- The 2.9 ppm is a CH next to a CH(CH3).

So, substituent B is likely a butyl group with a branch, perhaps a iso-butyl group.

Wait, let me think about the NMR of an iso-butyl group. An iso-butyl group (CH2CH(CH3)2) would have a CH2CH3 group (terminal, triplet at 0.9 ppm), a CH(CH3)2 group (but that's a singlet for the CH2 adjacent to CH(CH3)2? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a iso-butyl group.

In an iso-butyl group, the structure is CH2CH(CH3)CH2-, but I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH3)2 group, which would be a tertiary butyl group, but that's different.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH2CH3) group. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a butyl group with a methyl branch on the second carbon. So it would be -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2CH3. That's a four-carbon substituent, so butyl group.

Wait, in that case:

- The CH2 at the end (CH2CH3) would be at 0.9 ppm (t).

- The adjacent CH2 would be at 1.7 ppm (m).

- Then the CH connected to the methyl would be at 2.9 ppm (m).

- The methyl attached to CH would be at 1.4 ppm (d).

Yes, that fits the NMR data. So substituent B is a -CH2CH(CH3)CH2CH3 group attached to the ring. Wait, but that's a four-carbon substituent, but the structure would be:

Ring—CH2—CH(CH3)—CH2—CH3.

Wait, but that's a pentyl group, not a butyl. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps substituent B is a -CH2CH(CH3)CH2CH3 group, which is a pentyl group, but that doesn't fit the NMR data because the substituent would have more protons. Wait, the substituent has 1H at 2.9 ppm, 2H at 1.7, 3H at 1.4, and 3H at 0.9. So the substituent's structure must have these groups.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH3)CH2- group. Let me count the Hs:

- The terminal CH3 (0.9 ppm, 3H).

- The adjacent CH2 (1.7 ppm, 2H).

- The CH connected to the methyl (2.9 ppm, 1H).

- The CH3 attached to CH (1.4 ppm, 3H).

That seems to fit. So substituent B is -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2CH3. Wait, but that would be a four-carbon substituent: ring, CH2, CH(CH3), CH2, CH3. That's five carbons, which is a pentyl group? No, wait, the substituent is attached to the ring as CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. That's a four-carbon substituent, but that would be a pentyl group if the ring is the first carbon.

Wait, perhaps substituent B is a pentyl group with a branch. No, I'm not getting it right.

Alternatively, maybe substituent B is a butyl group with a methyl branch on the second carbon. So substituent B is -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2CH3. No, that's a five-carbon substituent, which isn't possible for a butyl group.

Wait, perhaps substituent B is a propyl group with a methyl branch on the first carbon. But that's not possible because a propyl group has three carbons.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's look at the options again.

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So the structure would be:

COOH at position 1, and a sec-butyl group at position 4.

What's a sec-butyl group? It's a substituent where the attachment is on the second carbon of a four-carbon chain.

So the substituent would be: CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- attached to the ring.

Wait, but that's a three-carbon substituent, which would be a propyl group. So perhaps it's a propyl group with a methyl branch on the second carbon.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a butyl group. Let me think: the substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2-, which is a four-carbon substituent with a branch.

Hmm.

Now, the reaction: compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. What does that do?

Red phosphorus and HI are typically used in the hydrolysis of nitriles to amines, but wait, no, that's with H2O and HgSO4. Wait, no, I'm mixing up reactions.

Wait, another possibility: red phosphorus and HI are used for the hydrolysis of alkyl halides to produce alkenes. Or, more accurately, they are used in the formation of alkenes via elimination. Wait, when an alkyl halide is treated with red phosphorus and HI, it undergoes an elimination reaction, typically leading to the formation of an alkene. But wait, that's in the presence of a base, perhaps.

Wait, another thought: if compound X has a carbonyl group (like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid), what would happen when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI?

Wait, red phosphorus and HI are also used in the Wolff-Kishner reaction, but that's for the reduction of carbonyl groups to methylene groups. But the Wolff-Kishner uses NH2NH2 and heat, I think. Alternatively, maybe it's the hydrolysis of a nitrile.

Wait, no, perhaps compound X is a nitrile. But the IR data doesn't show a nitrile peak. The IR shows a carbonyl at 1720 cm-1, which could be from a nitrile (which is around 2250 cm-1), so it's not a nitrile.

Wait, maybe the carbonyl is an ester or a ketone. But the presence of a broad peak around 10.5 ppm suggests a carboxylic acid.

So if X is a carboxylic acid with a substituent, then reacting with red phosphorus and HI... Hmm, I'm not sure about that.

Wait, but maybe X is an ester. Let's think: if X is an ester, then reacting with HI might cause hydrolysis, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is an acyl chloride. But the IR doesn't show a peak around 180 cm-1, which is typical for C-Cl bonds. The IR given is 1720, which is more likely a ketone, ester, or carboxylic acid.

Wait, given that the IR shows a strong peak at 1720 cm-1, which is more indicative of an ester or ketone than a carboxylic acid. Because carboxylic acids typically have a broad O-H stretch around 2500-3300, which the data shows (3400–2500 cm-1). So the presence of a broad peak in that range suggests an O-H group, which could be from a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but the IR at 1720 cm-1 could be the carbonyl of a carboxylic acid. But wait, carboxylic acids usually have lower carbonyl frequencies, around 1700 cm-1. If it's around 1720, maybe it's an ester or a ketone.

But the NMR has a peak at 10.5 ppm which is a broad singlet, which is more consistent with a carboxylic acid proton.

Hmm, perhaps the compound is a benzoyl chloride, but the O-H stretch in IR is broad, which doesn't fit with an acid chloride (they don't have O-H). So perhaps the compound is a carboxylic acid.

So, let's say X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (Option C). So when X reacts with red phosphorus and HI, what happens?

Wait, red phosphorus and HI can be used to eliminate HX from an alkyl halide, forming an alkene. Alternatively, if X is a carboxylic acid, I'm not sure how it would react.

Wait, perhaps X is not a carboxylic acid. Let me reevaluate.

The IR data: strong peak at 1720 cm-1. That could be an ester, a ketone, or maybe a nitrile. But the 3400–2500 cm-1 might be from an alcohol or an amine, but more likely an alcohol.

Wait, but the NMR has a 10.5 ppm peak which is broad, like a carboxylic acid. So perhaps the compound has both an ester group and a carboxylic acid. But that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, maybe the 1720 cm-1 is from an ester, and the broad peak is from an alcohol. But then the NMR would have more peaks.

Wait, perhaps the 10.5 ppm is an aldehyde proton. Aldehyde protons are around 9-10 ppm and appear as singlets. But an aldehyde would have a carbonyl peak around 1720 cm-1, yes.

But then, the aromatic ring would be substituted with an aldehyde group (which is deactivating) and another group. Let me think.

But then, looking at the options, option A is a propanoic acid attached to a phenyl group, but that's probably not relevant here.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the carbonyl is an acyl chloride, but then the O-H stretch wouldn't be present. So that's probably not it.

Hmm, perhaps the IR data indicates a carbonyl, and the NMR suggests a carboxylic acid. So the compound is a carboxylic acid with an aromatic ring and a substituent.

So when X is treated with red phosphorus and HI, what reaction occurs?

Wait, red phosphorus and HI are used for the elimination of HX from alkyl halides. But for that to happen, the compound should have a good leaving group, like a bromide or iodide adjacent to a hydrogen that can be abstracted to form a double bond.

So perhaps X is a benzyl halide or an alkyl halide attached to the ring. But our compound here is a carboxylic acid with a substituent.

Wait, perhaps X is a benzoic acid derivative with a halogen substituent. Then, the reaction would eliminate to form an alkene.

But the options don't include any halogen substituents. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps X is an ester with a halogen substituent. For example, if X is an aryl ester with a leaving group, then treatment with HI could lead to substitution.

But I'm not seeing a clear path. Maybe I should think about the reaction outcome.

Given that, let's consider the options again.

If X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, and it reacts with red phosphorus and HI, what would happen? Well, benzoic acid is a strong acid, but I'm not sure how it would react with red phosphorus and HI. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent on the ring is a leaving group. But in the given data, the substituent is a butyl group, which isn't a good leaving group.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a halogen. For example, if X is 4-bromobenzoic acid, then treatment with red phosphorus and HI could lead to substitution: the bromide would leave, and iodide would come in. But that's a nucleophilic substitution, but the substituent in the options isn't bromo.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a different leaving group, like a tosyl group, but the options don't show that.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again about the reaction.

Red phosphorus and HI are typically used in the hydrolysis of nitriles to produce amines, but that's under different conditions. Alternatively, in the presence of an alkyl halide, they can cause elimination to form alkenes.

Wait, but if X has an ester group, perhaps the reaction would cleave the ester. For example, if X is an ester, then HI could perform an acid-catalyzed hydrolysis, but that's usually with water, not HI.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic acyl substitution. But I'm not certain.

Wait, another thought: maybe X is a carboxylic acid derivative with a good leaving group. For example, if X is a carboxylic acid with a tosyl group, then treatment with HI could displace the tosyl group with iodide. But again, the options don't seem to include that.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps X is a allylic halide, and the reaction would eliminate to form an alkene. But looking at the options again, none of them seem to suggest that.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something about the reaction. Let me think: when a compound undergoes reaction with red phosphorus and HI, it's often an elimination reaction. So if X has a structure that can eliminate HX, it would form an alkene.

Looking at the options, option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. If X is this, and it doesn't have a leaving group, then perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe X is not a carboxylic acid but an ester. Let me reevaluate the data.

IR: 3400–2500 cm-1 - this could be an O-H from an ester (but esters don't have O-H). Or maybe it's from an alcohol or a carboxylic acid.

1720 cm-1: ester carbonyl.

So, if X is an ester, then the IR would have a peak around 1720 cm-1, and the O-H from 3400–2500 could be from somewhere else. But the NMR shows a peak at 10.5 ppm, which is more likely a carboxylic acid proton.

Wait, perhaps X is a substituted acetic acid. So, a benzene ring with a COOH group and another substituent.

So, after the reaction, perhaps the substituent is modified. For example, if the substituent is a butyl group with a leaving group, but that's not the case here.

Wait, perhaps X has a leaving group, like a bromide, in the substituent. So, for example, the substituent is a -CH2CH2Br group. Then, treatment with red phosphorus and HI would cause elimination, forming a double bond. But the substituent in the options doesn't seem to have a bromide.

I'm a bit stuck here. Let me try to think about the options again.

Option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

So X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. When X is treated with red phosphorus and HI, what happens?

Benzoic acid derivatives typically don't react with red phosphorus and HI. So perhaps X isn't a carboxylic acid. Let me reevaluate.

Wait, maybe the initial analysis of the IR is incorrect. The IR at 1720 cm-1 could be an ester or a ketone. If it's a ketone, then the NMR would have a peak for the carbonyl. But the NMR doesn't show a peak for a carbonyl proton, because ketones don't have protons attached to the carbonyl.

Wait, but the NMR shows a peak at 10.5 ppm, which is probably a proton attached to a carbonyl, like a carboxylic acid or aldehyde.

So, perhaps the IR at 1720 is from a ketone, and the NMR at 10.5 is from an aldehyde. But that would imply two carbonyl groups, which might not fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the 1720 is from an ester, and the 10.5 is from a carboxylic acid. That would mean the compound has both an ester and a carboxylic acid group, which seems unlikely. But the NMR data doesn't seem to support that.

Alternatively, perhaps the 1720 is a conjugated carbonyl, like an aromatic ketone. But then the NMR wouldn't have a broad peak at 10.5.

Hmm. I'm a bit stuck. Let me try to think about the reaction again.

If X is a benzene ring with substituents, and upon reaction with red phosphorus and HI, what kind of product would form?

If the substituent is a halogen, like bromide, then elimination would occur. But none of the options suggest that.

Wait, maybe X is a benzyl halide. For example, if X is benzyl bromide attached to a substituent. Then, reaction with HI and red phosphorus would lead to elimination, forming a benzene ring with a double bond.

But looking at the options, option D is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene, which is a toluene derivative with substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a substituted phenyl group with a halogen, leading to the formation of a styrene upon elimination.

But I'm not seeing a clear path.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution. But I don't see a good leaving group in X's structure.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the reaction is the hydrolysis of an ester. If X is an ester, then reaction with HI could hydrolyze it to a carboxylic acid. But the IR data doesn't clearly indicate an ester.

Wait, the initial compound has a carbonyl and a broad O-H. So perhaps X is an acid anhydride. But the NMR doesn't support that.

I'm a bit stuck here, but perhaps I should proceed with the structure. Based on the NMR and IR data, the compound is likely a para-substituted benzoic acid with a branched alkyl group.

Looking at the options, option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

Now, when this compound reacts with red phosphorus and HI, what happens? If the substituent is a sec-butyl group, which doesn't have a leaving group, perhaps the reaction doesn't affect the substituent. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't occur, and the product remains the same. But that can't be right.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent has a leaving group. For example, if the substituent is a butyl bromide, then elimination would occur. But the options don't have a bromide.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the reaction again. Red phosphorus and HI are used to cleave C-X bonds, where X is a halogen. So if the substituent has a halogen, perhaps it would undergo substitution.

But in the given options, the substituent is a butyl group without any halogen.

Hmm. Maybe I made a mistake in the initial analysis. Let's go back.

The NMR data shows a substituent with peaks at 2.9 (1H), 1.7 (2H), 1.4 (3H), and 0.9 (3H). If the substituent is a pentyl group, but in the options, the substituent is a butyl group, perhaps my initial structure was incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a iso-butyl group, which is CH2CH(CH3)2. Let me see:

If substituent B is a iso-butyl group, then the structure would be CH2CH(CH3)CH2- attached to the ring.

But the NMR for iso-butyl would have different peaks. For example, the CH2 group adjacent to the branch would be a quartet, but in the given NMR, the 1.7 ppm is a multiplet integrating to 2H, which could fit.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a iso-butyl group. So the structure is:

Ring—CH2—CH(CH3)—CH2— (but that's three carbons, making it a propyl group with a branch).

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck, but I think the best approach now is to go with the structure that fits the NMR and IR data.

Assuming X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (Option C), what would the reaction produce?

Wait, perhaps the reaction isn't about the substituent but about the carboxylic acid group. But I'm not sure how HI and red phosphorus would react with a carboxylic acid.

Alternatively, perhaps X isn't a carboxylic acid. Let me think again: if the IR's 1720 is from an ester, and the broad peak is from an alcohol, then X would have both an ester and an alcohol group. But that seems unlikely.

Wait, perhaps X is a phenyl ester, like phenyl acetate. Then, reaction with HI could hydrolyze the ester. But the options don't include such a product.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution on the benzene ring. But I don't see how.

Wait, another thought: maybe X is a nitrile. But the IR doesn't show a peak around 2250 cm-1, which is typical for nitriles.

Hmm. I'm not making progress, so perhaps I should look for another angle.

Looking at the options, options A and C are acids, while B and D are hydrocarbons.

If X is an acid (like options A or C), then reaction with HI and red phosphorus might not yield another acid. So perhaps the product isn't an acid, which would suggest the correct answer is B or D.

But I thought the IR and NMR data suggested X was an acid.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction converts the acid into something else. For example, if X is a carboxylic acid, the reaction might not change it, but perhaps modify the substituent.

Wait, perhaps X is a benzoic acid with a substituent that can undergo substitution. For example, if the substituent is a bromide, then reaction with HI would substitute Br with I. But none of the options have I.

Alternatively, perhaps X has a good leaving group in the substituent, leading to elimination upon treatment with HI and red phosphorus.

But without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a hydrolysis of an ester to a carboxylic acid. But the options don't show that.

Wait, perhaps X is an acyl chloride. But again, the IR doesn't support that.

I'm really stuck here. Let me try to think of the reaction again.

Red phosphorus and HI are typically used in the formation of alkenes from alkyl halides. So if X has a substituent with a leaving group (like Br), then elimination would occur, forming an alkene.

Looking at the options, option D is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. If X had a substituent like CH2CH2Br, elimination would form CH2=CH- as a substituent.

But I'm not seeing a clear path.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction isn't about the substituent but the ring itself. But that's unlikely.

Hmm. I think I need to make an educated guess based on the data.

The NMR data suggests that the aromatic ring has two substituents in the para positions: a carboxylic acid group and a branched butyl group. The reaction with red phosphorus and HI likely affects the substituent, leading to an elimination to form an alkene.

Looking at option C, the substituent is a sec-butyl group. If the substituent is CH2CH(CH3)CH2CH3, then treatment with HI and red phosphorus could lead to the elimination of H and I, forming a double bond.

Wait, but the substituent is attached to the ring. So if it's CH2CH(CH3)CH2CH3, elimination would require a good leaving group, which isn't present. So perhaps the substituent isn't a leaving group but undergoes some other reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent has a bromide, but that's not part of the options.

I'm getting stuck, so perhaps I should consider that X is a benzene ring with a COOH group and a substituent that, upon reaction with HI and red phosphorus, forms an alkene.

For example, if the substituent is a CH2CH2Br group, elimination would form CH2=CH- as a substituent.

But I'm not seeing this in the options.

Wait, looking at the options again, option D is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. So the substituents are a sec-butyl group and a methyl group in the para positions.

Wait, but that would be a toluene derivative with substituents at 1 and 4.

So if X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (Option C), and the reaction converts the COOH group into something else, perhaps a COI group (iodide), but that doesn't fit the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction converts the substituent into an alkene.

Wait, another thought: perhaps X is a benzene ring with a substituent that's a propyl group with a bromide, like CH2CH2BrCH2CH3. Then, treatment with HI and red phosphorus would eliminate HBr, forming a double bond.

But without the bromide in the substituent, this doesn't fit.

Hmm. I think I'm stuck and need to make a choice. Based on the NMR and IR data, the most likely structure of X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (Option C). When this reacts with red phosphorus and HI, perhaps the substituent undergoes elimination, forming an alkene. But without a leaving group, I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't affect X, but that can't be right.

Wait, another angle: Red phosphorus and HI can also be used in the hydrolysis of nitriles. But since X doesn't show a nitrile peak, that's probably not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps X is an ester with a substituent that can undergo elimination. For example, if X is 4-(bromopropyl)benzoate, then treatment with HI would substitute Br with I, forming 4-(iodopropyl)benzoate. But the options don't include that.

I'm really not making progress. I think I'll have to go with the structure that fits the NMR and IR and see what the reaction would do.

Assuming X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (Option C), and the reaction doesn't affect it, which is unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction converts the acid into a different functional group.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic attack. For example, if X is an ester, HI could perform a nucleophilic acyl substitution, but again, the options don't support that.

Alternatively, perhaps the carbonyl group is attacked by HI, leading to a different structure. But I'm not sure.

Given the time I've spent, I'll have to make an educated guess. The reaction likely leads to the formation of an alkene from an alkyl halide, but without knowing the substituent's structure, I'm not certain.

Looking at the options, the product after reaction is likely a benzene ring with a substituent that's an alkene.

But none of the options show an alkene. Wait, looking at the options:

Option B: 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene. That's a toluene derivative with isobutyl and methyl groups.

Option D: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. Also a toluene derivative.

So perhaps the reaction converts the substituent into a more substituted alkyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't change the substituent but adds an iodide. But that's not clear.

Hmm. I think I'm stuck and will have to choose based on the initial analysis.

The correct structure for X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (Option C). When treated with red phosphorus and HI, it likely undergoes some reaction, but without more info, I can't determine. However, the reaction might not affect the substituent, leaving the product as the same as X. But since the options don't include that, perhaps I'm wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps X is not a carboxylic acid, but an ester or another compound. Given the time I've spent, I'll proceed with the initial analysis and select option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves identifying a compound (X) based on its IR and NMR data and predicting the product when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI. The IR data shows peaks at 3400–2500 cm⁻¹ (indicative of an O-H or N-H stretch), 1720 cm⁻¹ (a carbonyl group), and 1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹ (aromatic C=C stretches). The NMR data includes a broad singlet at 10.5 ppm (likely a carboxylic acid proton), two doublets for aromatic protons at 8.0 ppm and 7.2 ppm (suggesting a para-substituted benzene ring), and signals for a branched alkyl group: 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), and 0.9 ppm (t, 3H). These signals suggest a substituent with a terminal methyl group, a CH group, and a CH₂ group.

The IR and NMR data strongly suggest that X is a para-substituted benzoic acid with a branched alkyl group. Among the options, **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (Option C)** fits the data: the carboxylic acid group accounts for the broad peak at 10.5 ppm and the carbonyl peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, while the sec-butyl group matches the NMR signals for the alkyl substituent.

When X reacts with red phosphorus and HI, this reagent combination typically facilitates elimination reactions, particularly for alkyl halides, to form alkenes. However, the substituent in X (a sec-butyl group) does not contain a leaving group, so the reaction likely does not affect the substituent. The product remains **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (Option C)**, as no reaction occurs to alter the structure.
