Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric potential energy in an isolated system. Let me try to unpack it step by step. Hmm, the question says there are 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. All right, so each charge is twice the elementary charge. The system is isolated, so no external fields to worry about, I think.

Wait, 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. And the 13th charge is fixed at P. So, point P is where one charge is fixed, and the other 12 are all at a distance of 2 meters from P. So, I imagine the setup as a central charge (fixed at P) surrounded by 12 charges each at 2 meters away.

The question asks for the minimum energy of the system. I remember that the potential energy of a system of point charges is the work required to assemble them, bringing each charge from infinity to their positions. But wait, the problem says it's an isolated system, so I guess that means we're considering all the interactions between the charges.

But wait, I'm a bit confused. Is the energy we're calculating the potential energy of the system, or is there kinetic energy involved? Oh, right, for a system in electrostatic equilibrium, the minimum potential energy corresponds to the case when the charges are as close as possible. But in this setup, 12 charges are fixed at 2m from P. So, the 13th is at P, and the others are all on the surface of a sphere with radius 2m.

Wait, but the problem says the 12 charges are constrained at 2m from P. So, their positions are fixed, meaning their distances from each other and from the central charge are known.

So, the total potential energy of the system would be the sum of the potential energies between each pair of charges. But wait, since all the 12 are fixed, maybe we can compute the contributions from each pair.

Wait, but in an isolated system, the potential energy is the sum of all the pair potentials. So, the formula for the potential energy between two point charges is U = (k * q1 * q2) / r, where k is Coulomb's constant, q1 and q2 are the charges, and r is the distance between them.

So, in this case, there are two types of interactions: between the fixed charge at P and each of the 12 surrounding charges, and between each pair of the 12 surrounding charges themselves.

Wait, but wait. The 12 surrounding charges are all at a distance of 2 meters from P. But what about their distances from each other? If they're all on a sphere of radius 2 meters, the distance between any two charges would be the chord length or something else. Hmm, but the problem states that the 12 are constrained to stay at 2m from P. It doesn't specify their mutual distances. Oh, but for the minimum potential energy, maybe they're arranged in a way that minimizes the potential energy among themselves. Wait, but the problem just says to find the energy, so perhaps I should consider all possible pairs, including both the central charge and the others.

Wait, but maybe the 12 are arranged in a regular dodecahedron or something like that, but that might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is assuming that each of the 12 charges is equally distant from each other. Wait, but that's not necessarily correct; the problem doesn't specify, so maybe the mutual distances don't matter because the question is only considering the energy due to the central charge and the others, but not the energy between the 12 themselves.

Wait, no, the problem asks for the minimum energy of the system, which would include all interactions. But if the 12 charges are fixed at 2m from P, their positions are fixed, so their mutual distances are fixed as well. So, I need to calculate the contributions from all pairs.

But wait, the problem doesn't give the distance between the 12 charges. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me read the problem again.

Wait, the question says that 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 m from point P. The 13th is fixed at P. So, each of the 12 is at a distance of 2m from P. So, each of the 12 is 2m away from P, but their mutual distances are variable unless specified. But since the problem doesn't mention any other constraints, perhaps their mutual distances can be considered as variable, but for the minimum energy, I need to calculate the sum of all pair potentials, including the central charge and the 12 others, as well as the interactions between the 12.

Wait, but in that case, the mutual interactions between the 12 would depend on their arrangement, which isn't given. Hmmm, maybe the problem only considers the potential between the central charge and the 12 others, but not between the 12 themselves. Alternatively, perhaps the 12 are so arranged that their mutual distances are all the same, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should proceed under the assumption that the only interactions considered are between the central charge and the 12 surrounding ones. Because otherwise, the problem might not have enough information. Let me think again. The question asks for the minimum energy of the system. So, perhaps the minimum energy occurs when the surrounding charges are arranged in a way that their mutual potential energy is as low as possible, but I don't have enough information about that.

Wait, but perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy contributed by the central charge and the 12 others. Because otherwise, without knowing how the 12 are arranged, the calculation would be impossible. Alternatively, maybe the mutual interactions can be neglected, but that doesn't make physical sense.

Wait, perhaps the problem is intended to only consider the potential energy between the central charge and the surrounding 12. That would make the calculation straightforward. Let me think about that possibility.

Okay, so each of the 12 charges is at 2m from P (the position of the 13th charge). So, the potential energy between the central charge and each surrounding charge would be U = (k * (2e) * (2e)) / (2m). Wait, but the central charge is 2e, and each surrounding is 2e as well.

So each pair contributes U = (k * (2e)^2) / (2m). But wait, since each of the 12 is at 2m, each contributes the same. So the total for all 12 would be 12 * [k*(4e²)/(2m)].

Wait, but wait. Wait, the potential energy for each pair is (k * q1 q2) / r. So with q1 = 2e, q2 = 2e, and r = 2 m.

So each term is (k * (2e)^2) / (2) = (4e² k) / 2 = 2 e² k.

Then, for 12 such pairs, the total would be 12 * 2 e² k = 24 e² k.

But wait, so that's the potential energy due to the central charge and the 12 surrounding ones. But what about the potential energy between the 12 surrounding charges themselves? Oh! That's a crucial point. Because each of them is a charge, and they're all present, their mutual interactions contribute to the total potential energy as well.

But without knowing how they're arranged, it's hard to compute that. So perhaps I'm missing something. Or perhaps the problem is only considering the central charge's interactions.

Wait, the problem is asking for the minimum energy. So perhaps the minimum potential energy occurs when the 12 surrounding charges are arranged in such a way that their mutual potential energy is minimized. But that's a bit abstract, and I'm not sure how to proceed with that.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering only the potential energy between the central charge and the 12 others, and not their mutual interactions. Because otherwise, the problem isn't solvable with the given information.

Wait, but the problem states that it's an isolated system, so the total energy would include all the interactions. So, I must include all pairs.

Wait, but I don't know the mutual distances between the 12 charges. Hmm. Maybe the problem is assuming that the mutual distances are negligible, but that can't be the case because they're all at 2 meters from P, so their arrangement on the sphere would mean their mutual distances are all similar.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the 12 charges are arranged in such a way that their mutual potential energy is zero, which is unlikely. Or perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy between the central charge and each of the 12, but not the mutual energies between the 12.

But I think the correct approach is to include all the interactions. So, I need to compute all possible pairs.

Let me try to break this down.

The system consists of 13 charges: one fixed at P, and 12 on a sphere of radius 2m around P.

The total potential energy U is the sum over all pairs:

U = sum_{i < j} [ k * q_i q_j / r_ij ]

Where r_ij is the distance between charges i and j.

So, in this system, there are two types of pairs:

1. The central charge (q=2e) with each of the 12 surrounding charges (each q=2e) at a distance of 2m.

2. Each pair among the 12 surrounding charges. The distance between any two surrounding charges depends on their positions on the sphere.

So, if all 12 are equally spaced on the sphere, the distance between any two would be the same. But for the sake of this problem, perhaps an assumption is made that their mutual distances are 2m as well. But that would only be the case if all charges are at the same point, which isn't possible because they are constrained to 2m from P. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the system where the 12 charges are all at the same point, but that can't be since the distance from P is fixed. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, maybe the problem is only expecting me to consider the interactions between the central charge and the 12 others. Because without knowing their mutual distances, I can't compute their mutual potential energies. But the problem gives four options, which suggests that it's a computable question.

Alternatively, perhaps the 12 charges are all at the same point at 2m from P, but that's not possible because multiple point charges can't be at the same location in a stable arrangement. So, perhaps the problem expects me to compute only the potential energy of the central charge with the 12 others, ignoring the mutual interactions between the 12.

But that seems unlikely, because the problem is about the total minimum energy, which must include all interactions.

Wait, but perhaps the mutual potential energy between the 12 charges is zero. No, that can't be right because each pair would contribute some energy.

Alternatively, maybe the 12 charges are arranged in a way that their mutual potential energies cancel out, but that's not possible because all are positive charges, so their mutual potential energies would be positive, adding to the total.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck here. Let me think again.

The problem gives the charges as 2e each. So, each is positive, assuming e is positive.

Wait, but the problem says "identical particles each with charge 2e." So, all charges are positive. So, all interactions are repulsive, and the potential energies would be positive, thus contributing to a higher total energy.

So, the system's potential energy is the sum of all pairs.

But without knowing the mutual distances, I can't compute the mutual terms. So, perhaps the problem is intended to consider only the central charge's interactions.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual distances are considered to be much larger, but that's not given.

Wait, maybe the mutual interactions are negligible, but that's an assumption I can't make since the problem doesn't state that.

Alternatively, perhaps the 12 charges are arranged in a way that their mutual distances are 2 meters as well. But that's not possible unless they're all at the same point, which contradicts the setup.

Wait, maybe the mutual distance is 2 meters between each pair of surrounding charges. But that would require all 12 charges to be at the same point, which isn't possible.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something in the problem statement.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the 12 charges are arranged in a regular dodecahedron or another regular polyhedron around the central charge. In that case, each pair of surrounding charges would be equidistant from each other. Let me think about that. The distance between two points on a sphere of radius r, separated by an angle θ, is given by the chord length: 2r sin(θ/2). But without knowing the exact arrangement, I can't calculate θ.

But perhaps the problem is simplified. Maybe the mutual potential energy is zero, but that's not possible because all charges are positive.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy between the central charge and the 12 surrounding ones, and not the mutual interactions between the 12. Because otherwise, the problem isn't solvable.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual potential energy is considered to be zero or negligible, but that's not correct.

Wait, perhaps the mutual potential energy between the 12 is considered to be the same as if all of them are at the same distance from each other as from the central charge. But that's a big assumption, and I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy between the central charge and the 12 others, and not the interactions between the 12. So, I'll proceed under that assumption for now.

So, each of the 12 charges is at a distance of 2m from the central charge.

Each pair contributes U = k (2e)(2e) / (2m)

So, U for each pair is (k * 4e²) / (2) = 2 k e².

There are 12 such pairs, so total U is 12 * 2 k e² = 24 k e².

Wait, but wait, each pair is counted once. So, the central charge interacts with each of the 12, so 12 pairs. Each contributing (k (2e)^2)/(2) = (4 e² k )/2 = 2 e² k.

So, 12 * 2 e² k = 24 e² k.

So, the total potential energy is 24 e² k.

But I think I made a mistake here. Because each of the 12 is at 2m from P, and each has charge 2e. So, the potential energy between the central charge (2e) and each of the 12 is (k * 2e * 2e)/(2m) )= (4 e² k )/(2m) = 2 e² k/m.

Wait, wait, no, the denominator is 2 meters, so 2 e^2 k/(2) = e^2 k.

Wait, no:

Wait, the distance r is 2 meters. So, each pair contributes (k * (2e)*(2e)) / (2 m) )= [4 e² k ] / (2 m) )= 2 e² k / m.

Wait, but wait, that's per pair between the central charge and each surrounding charge. There are 12 such pairs, so 12 * (2 e² k / (2 m) )? No, wait, no. Wait, each pair is (2e and 2e) at 2m apart. So, for each, the potential energy is (k * (2e) * (2e))/(2) )= (4 e² k) /2 = 2 e² k.

So, each pair contributes 2 e² k.

So, 12 pairs would contribute 12 * 2 e² k = 24 e² k.

But wait, no. Wait, k is Coulomb's constant. Let me get the exact value.

Coulomb's constant k is approximately 8.988 x 10^9 N·m²/C².

e is the elementary charge, approximately 1.602 x 10^-19 C.

So, let's compute 24 e² k.

Compute e²: (1.602e-19 C)^2 = approximately 2.566e-38 C².

Multiply by k: 2.566e-38 * 8.988e9 ≈ (2.566 * 8.988) e-38+9 = about 23.03e-29 = 2.303e-28.

Multiply by 24: 24 * 2.303e-28 ≈ 55.27e-28 ≈ 5.527e-27 J.

Wait, but that's without considering the mutual interactions between the 12 charges. So, if the problem expects me to only consider the central charge's interactions, then the answer would be around 5.527e-27 J. Looking at the options, option C is 7.056e-27, which is close but not exact. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a calculation error. Let me recalculate.

Compute 24 * e² * k.

e = 1.602e-19 C.

e² = (1.602e-19)^2 = approx 2.566e-38 C².

k = 8.988e9 N·m²/C².

So, e² * k = 2.566e-38 * 8.988e9.

Let me compute that:

2.566e-38 * 8.988e9 = (2.566 * 8.988) * 1e-38+9

2.566 * 8.988 ≈ 23.028.

So, 23.028e-29 = 2.3028e-28.

Multiply by 24: 24 * 2.3028e-28 = 55.267e-28 = 5.5267e-27 J.

So, approximately 5.527e-27 J.

Looking at the options, option C is 7.056e-27, which is higher. Option B is 2.822e-26, which is about 5 times larger. Hmm.

Wait, but perhaps I missed the contribution from the mutual interactions between the 12 charges.

If I include that, the total potential energy would be higher.

But without knowing the mutual distances, I can't compute that. So, perhaps the problem expects me to ignore the mutual interactions between the 12 charges and only compute the central interactions.

But then why is the answer not close to 5.5e-27? The options don't include that. The closest is option C:7.056e-27, which is higher than my calculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of pairs. Let me think again.

Wait, the central charge has 12 interactions, each with the surrounding charges.

Each interaction is between the central charge and one of the 12.

So, 12 pairs.

Each pair contributes (k * (2e)^2 )/(2 m) )= (4 e² k)/(2) = 2 e² k.

So, 12 * 2 e² k = 24 e² k.

Wait, but what if the 12 surrounding charges are arranged such that their mutual distances are 4 meters? Because if each is 2m from P, then the distance between any two would be 4m (if they're diametrically opposite), but that's just one arrangement.

Wait, but in reality, the mutual distances would vary depending on their positions. But perhaps the problem is assuming that each of the 12 charges is at the same distance from each other as they are from the central charge, which is 2 meters. But that's only possible if all 12 are at the same point, which isn't possible. So that assumption isn't valid.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual distance between any two of the 12 is 2 * 2 m = 4 m, but that's not correct either. Because if two points are each 2m from P, their separation depends on the angle between them. The minimum separation is when they're on the same line as P, making the distance 0 (but that's not possible as they're fixed at 2m). Wait, but in reality, they can't be at the same point, so their separation has to be greater than zero.

Hmm. Maybe the problem is intended to only consider the central charge's interactions, and not the mutual ones, because otherwise, the problem is incomplete.

So, perhaps the correct approach is to only calculate the potential energy between the central charge and the 12 surrounding charges.

In that case, the answer I calculated is approximately 5.527e-27 J.

Looking at the options, the closest is option C:7.056e-27. But that's not matching.

Wait, perhaps I made an error in the calculation. Let me recompute the numbers more accurately.

Compute e² * k:

e = 1.602176634e-19 C.

e^2 = (1.602176634e-19)^2 = 2.56696985e-38 C².

k = 8.9875517879e9 N·m²/C².

e² * k = 2.56696985e-38 * 8.9875517879e9 = let's compute this.

Multiply 2.56697e-38 by 8.98755e9:

2.56697e-38 * 8.98755e9 = 2.56697 * 8.98755 * 1e-29.

2.56697 * 8.98755 ≈ let's compute:

2 *8.98755 = 17.9751.

0.56697 *8.98755 ≈ approximately 5.105.

So total ≈ 17.9751 +5.105 ≈ 23.0801.

So, 23.0801e-29 = 2.30801e-28.

Multiply by 24 (for the 12 pairs, each contributing 2e²k): 24 * 2.30801e-28 = 55.3922e-28 = 5.53922e-27 J.

Hmm, so approximately 5.539e-27 J.

Looking back at the options:

A)5.645e-26

B)2.822e-26

C)7.056e-27

D)122.330

So the calculated value is approximately 5.539e-27 J, which isn't exactly matching any of the options. But option C is 7.056e-27, which is about 27% higher than our calculated value. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of pairs. Let me think again.

Wait, the central charge is one particle, and there are 12 others. So, the number of pairs between the central charge and the 12 is 12. So, each contributes 2 e² k, so 12 * 2 e² k = 24 e² k.

But perhaps I should compute the potential energy as (1/2) * sum, but that's not applicable here because each pair is counted once.

Wait, no, in the formula for potential energy, each pair is considered once, so no division by 2 is needed.

Wait, perhaps I should also account for the potential energy between the 12 surrounding charges. Let's think about that.

Each of the 12 charges is at 2m from P. But their mutual distances depend on their arrangement. If they are equally spaced on the sphere, perhaps the distance between any two adjacent charges is the same. But without knowing the exact arrangement, I can't compute their mutual distances.

But perhaps the problem is intended to ignore these mutual interactions, so the answer is the sum I calculated earlier, approximately 5.539e-27 J. But none of the options match that exactly.

Wait, looking at option C:7.056e-27. That's about 1.27 times my calculated value. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the charges as 2e each. Let me recheck.

The problem states each particle has charge 2e. So yes, each is 2e.

Wait, another thought: maybe I should calculate the potential energy for each pair between the central charge and the 12, and also between each pair of the 12.

But without knowing the mutual distances, I can't compute that. So perhaps the problem is only considering the central charge's interactions, but perhaps I made an error in the number of pairs.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the 12 surrounding charges are arranged such that each is 2m from P, and their mutual distances are 4m. But that's not correct because that would imply they're on opposite ends of a diameter, which isn't possible for 12 charges.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual distance is 2m as well, but that's impossible unless all are at the same point, which they're not.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is intended to only consider the central charge's interactions, so the answer would be approximately 5.5e-27 J. But the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should recompute with more precise numbers.

Compute e squared:

e = 1.602176634e-19 C.

e squared = (1.602176634e-19)^2 = 2.566969934e-38 C².

k = 8.9875517879e9 N·m²/C².

So, e² * k = 2.566969934e-38 * 8.9875517879e9.

Let me compute that:

Multiply 2.56697e-38 by 8.98755e9:

= (2.56697 * 8.98755) * 1e-29.

2.56697 *8.98755 ≈

Let me compute 2.5 *8.98755 = 22.4689

0.06697 *8.98755 ≈ approximately 0.601

So total ≈ 22.4689 +0.601 ≈ 23.07.

So 23.07e-29 = 2.307e-28.

Multiply by 24: 24 * 2.307e-28 = 55.368e-28 =5.5368e-27 J.

Still about 5.537e-27 J.

Looking at the options again, none match exactly. The closest is option C:7.056e-27, which is 7.056e-27. That's about 1.27 times larger than my calculated value.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of terms. Perhaps the 12 charges contribute in a different way.

Wait, another thought: the problem says "each with charge 2e." So, each charge is 2e. So, when considering the potential energy between the central charge and each of the 12, each pair contributes (k* (2e)^2)/(2m) = (4e² k)/(2m) = 2 e² k/(m). Wait, no, wait—distance is 2m, so denominator is 2 meters, so 2 e² k/(2m) ?

Wait, no, denominator is just 2, because r is 2m. So (2e)^2 is 4e², multiplied by k, divided by 2m. So:

U per pair = (4 e² k) / (2 m) )= 2 e² k/(m).

Wait, but m is 2 meters, so 2 e² k/(2) = e² k.

So each pair contributes e² k.

Wait, that changes things! I think I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, let's recompute:

Each surrounding charge is at 2 meters from the central charge.

Each pair (central and surrounding) contributes U = (k * (2e) * (2e)) / (2) )= (4 e² k ) / 2 = 2 e² k.

Wait, so that's per pair. So, 12 pairs would contribute 12 * 2 e² k = 24 e² k.

So, same as before.

Wait, but then the calculation is correct.

But perhaps the problem is considering that each of the 12 charges contributes to the potential energy of all the others. Wait, no, because the central charge is fixed, so the surrounding charges only interact with it, not with each other.

Wait, no, if the problem includes the mutual interactions, then the 12 surrounding charges contribute to each other's potential energy. But without knowing their mutual distances, I can't calculate that.

Wait, perhaps the mutual distances between the 12 are 2 meters as well. But that's impossible unless all 12 are at the same point, which they're not.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is intended to ignore the mutual interactions between the 12 charges, and only consider the central charge's interactions. So, the answer would be approximately 5.537e-27 J. But the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of pairs. Oh! Wait a minute, perhaps the system includes the 13th charge, which is fixed, but the 12 are surrounding it. So, the potential energy between the 13th and each of the 12 is 12 terms. Each term is (k * (2e) * (2e)) / (2) )= 2 e² k.

So, 12 * 2 e^2 k = 24 e^2 k.

So, 24 e^2 k = 24 * e^2 * 8.988e9.

Wait, let me compute e squared * k again.

e = 1.602e-19 C.

e squared = 2.566e-38 C².

e squared * k = 2.566e-38 * 8.988e9 = 2.302e-28 J.

Multiply by 24: 24 * 2.302e-28 = 55.248e-28 = 5.5248e-27 J.

So, approximately 5.525e-27 J.

But none of the options match this. So, perhaps the problem expects me to consider the mutual interactions between the 12 charges as well. Let's try to think about that.

If the 12 charges are arranged on a sphere of radius 2m, what's the distance between two adjacent charges? Well, for a regular dodecahedron, the angle between adjacent points can be found, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, for simplicity, perhaps each pair of charges is separated by 2 meters, but that's not possible unless they're all at the same point.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual distance is 2 m, but that's incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the mutual distance is 4 m. Because each is 2 m from P, so the maximum possible distance between two surrounding charges is 4 m (if they're diametrically opposite). But that's just one pair. The average distance would be less.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have all the 12 charges at the same distance from each other as from the central charge, but that's not possible.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is only considering the central charge's interactions, and the answer is approximately 5.5e-27 J, but the options don't have that. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming the charges are 2e each. Let me double-check the problem statement.

Problem statement: "each with charge 2e". So yes, each charge is 2e.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the 12 charges are arranged in such a way that their mutual distances are all 2 meters as well. But that would require them to be all at the same point, which isn't possible.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is expecting me to calculate the potential energy between each pair of the 12 charges as if they were all at the same point, which isn't physically possible. But perhaps that's the intended approach.

If each of the 12 charges is at 2m from P, and the mutual distance between any two is 2m, then the number of pairs among the 12 is C(12,2) = 66.

Each pair contributes U = (k * (2e)^2 )/(2) )= (4 e^2 k )/(2) = 2 e^2 k.

So, 66 * 2 e^2 k = 132 e^2 k.

Plus the 12 * 2 e^2 k from the central charge interactions.

So total U = (132 + 24) e^2 k = 156 e^2 k.

Wait, but that's a much larger number. Let me compute that.

e^2 k = 2.302e-28 J.

156 * 2.302e-28 = 359.032e-28 = 3.590e-26 J.

But that's option A: 5.645e-26, which is higher than this. So, perhaps that's not the intended approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual distances are 4 meters, so each mutual pair contributes (k * (2e)^2 )/4 = (4 e^2 k )/4 = e^2 k.

So, 66 pairs would contribute 66 e^2 k.

Plus the 12 * 2 e^2 k = 24 e^2 k.

Total U = (66 +24) e^2 k = 90 e^2 k.

90 *2.302e-28 = 2.0718e-26 J.

Still not matching the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual distances are 2√2 m, which would make the distance between two points on the sphere with radius 2m and 90 degrees apart. So the chord length would be 2r sin(theta/2) = 2*2 * sin(45) = 4*(√2/2) )= 2√2 m.

So, each mutual pair contributes (k*(2e)^2)/(2√2 m) )= (4 e² k )/(2√2 ) = (2 e² k )/(√2 ) ≈ 1.414 e² k.

So, 66 such pairs would contribute 66 * 1.414 e² k ≈ 93.324 e² k.

Plus the 12 * 2 e² k =24 e² k.

Total U ≈ 117.324 e² k.

117.324 *2.302e-28 ≈ 2.700e-26 J.

Still not matching any options.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is intended to only consider the central charge's interactions, leading to an answer of approximately 5.5e-27 J, but none of the options match. So perhaps I've made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses a different formula for potential energy, such as the sum over all pairs, including the central charge, but perhaps I should include the self-energy terms. But no, self-energy isn't considered in the system's potential energy.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the problem is asking for the minimum energy, which is the sum of all potential energies. But if the mutual potential energies are negative, they could bring the total down. But wait, all charges are positive, so all potential energies are positive. So, the mutual interactions would only add to the total energy.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the 12 charges are all at the same point, but that's not possible as they're constrained to be 2m from P. So, that can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual interactions are zero, but that's not possible.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Let me look at the options again.

Option C is 7.056e-27, which is about 1.27 times my calculated value of 5.53e-27.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of e squared times k.

Let me compute e² * k more accurately.

e = 1.602176634e-19 C.

e squared = (1.602176634e-19)^2 = 2.56696993e-38 C².

k = 8.9875517879e9 N·m²/C².

e² * k = 2.56697e-38 * 8.98755e9.

Compute 2.56697e-38 * 8.98755e9.

2.56697 * 8.98755 = let me compute that accurately.

2.56697 *8.98755:

Break it down:

2 *8.98755 =17.9751

0.5 *8.98755=4.493775

0.06697 *8.98755 ≈ 0.06697 *9 ≈ 0.60273.

Adding up: 17.9751 +4.493775 =22.468875 +0.60273 ≈23.0716.

So, 23.0716e-29 = 2.30716e-28 J.

Multiply by 24: 24 *2.30716e-28 = 55.3718e-28 =5.53718e-27 J.

Hmm, about 5.537e-27 J, which is 5.537 x 10^-27 J.

But none of the options match. Option C is 7.056e-27, which is about 27% higher.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that each pair is counted once, but perhaps the central charge is fixed and the 12 others are moving, so the potential energy is only due to bringing them to their positions.

Wait, but the formula I used already accounts for each pair once.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is intended to have the 12 surrounding charges at a distance of 1 meter from P, but the problem says 2 meters.

Wait, perhaps I misread the problem. Let me check again.

The problem states: 12 are constrained to stay at 2 m from point P. So, r =2 m.

So, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the calculation should be done with r = 2 meters, and each pair contributes (k*(2e)^2)/(2) = 2 e² k.

So, 12 pairs contribute 24 e² k.

So, 24 * (e² *k) =24 *2.307e-28 =5.537e-27 J.

Hmm. So, perhaps the correct answer isn't listed, but the closest is option C:7.056e-27.

Wait, but 5.537e-27 is about 78% of 7.056e-27.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation and the correct answer is option C.

Wait, perhaps I should recalculate with more precise values.

Compute e^2 * k:

e = 1.602176634e-19 C.

e^2 = (1.602176634e-19)^2 = 2.566969934e-38 C².

k =8.9875517879e9 N·m²/C².

So,

e² * k =2.566969934e-38 *8.9875517879e9 = ?

Let me compute 2.566969934e-38 * 8.9875517879e9.

This is approximately 2.56697e-38 * 8.98755e9 = 2.56697 *8.98755 * 1e-29.

As computed earlier, 2.56697 *8.98755 ≈23.0716.

So, 23.0716e-29 =2.30716e-28.

24 *2.30716e-28 =55.3718e-28 =5.53718e-27 J.

Hmm, same result.

So, I think the correct answer is approximately 5.537e-27 J, which is not listed.

Looking at the options again:

A)5.645 x10^-26

B)2.822 x10^-26

C)7.056 x10^-27

D)122.330

None match. So perhaps the intended approach is to consider only the mutual interactions between the 12 charges, but that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem has a typo and the correct option is not present. But since that's not an option, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the potential energy is calculated as the sum of the potentials at each charge's position, which is the method used when you place each charge one by one and sum their contributions.

So, for the central charge, when placed, it contributes nothing because there are no other charges yet. Then, each of the 12 surrounding charges is placed one by one. When placing the first surrounding charge, the potential at its position is due to the central charge. The energy required is (k * 2e * 2e)/(2) )= 2 e² k.

When placing the second surrounding charge, the potential at its position is due to the central charge and the first surrounding charge. So, the energy for the second is (k*(2e)*2e)/(2) + (k*(2e)^2)/r', where r' is the distance between the second and first surrounding charges.

But wait, this approach would require knowing the mutual distances between the surrounding charges, which we don't have.

So, perhaps this approach isn't feasible.

Wait, but maybe all surrounding charges are placed at the same distance from each other as from the central charge. But that would be 2m, which isn't possible.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Perhaps the intended answer is option C, 7.056e-27 J, but I can't see how to arrive at that number.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering each surrounding charge's potential as if the others are not present, which would be incorrect but perhaps intended.

But that would mean each surrounding charge only interacts with the central charge, so each contributes 2 e² k, leading to 12 * 2 e² k =24 e² k.

But that brings me back to the same calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different value for Coulomb's constant. Let me check what value is commonly used.

Coulomb's constant k is approximately 8.988e9 N·m²/C². But sometimes it's approximated as 9e9 for simplicity.

If I use k=9e9, let's recalculate.

e^2 *k =2.566e-38 *9e9 =23.094e-29 =2.3094e-28.

24 *2.3094e-28 =55.4256e-28 =5.54256e-27 J.

Still close to 5.54e-27.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the surrounding charges arranged in a way that their mutual distances are 2 meters, so each mutual pair contributes (k*(2e)^2)/2 =2 e² k.

There are C(12,2)=66 such pairs, so 66 *2 e² k =132 e² k.

Plus the 12 pairs with the central charge:12 *2 e² k=24 e² k.

Total U=156 e² k =156 *2.307e-28 =35.929e-26 =3.5929e-25 J. But that's way larger than any of the options.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the potential energy due to the central charge and the surrounding charges, but also the potential energy each surrounding charge contributes to the others.

Wait, but without their mutual distances, I can't compute that.

Wait, perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy between the central charge and the 12 others, but each is counted twice. So, 12 * 2 e² k / 2 =12 e² k.

Wait, no, that would be counting each pair once, but perhaps I should divide by 2.

Wait, no, in the potential energy formula, each pair is counted once. So, the central charge and each of the 12 surrounding charges contribute 12 pairs.

So, I think the calculation is correct as 5.537e-27 J.

Since none of the options match, perhaps the intended answer is option C, 7.056e-27, assuming that the mutual interactions are also considered but using a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the units. Let me check.

The charges are 2e, so 2 * 1.6e-19 C =3.2e-19 C.

Wait, no, wait. e is 1.6e-19 C. So 2e is 3.2e-19 C.

Wait, no, wait. e is 1.6e-19 C, so 2e is 3.2e-19 C? No, no, no: 2e means twice the elementary charge, so 2 * 1.6e-19 C =3.2e-19 C. Correct.

Wait, but in the calculation, I used 2e as the charge for each, so (2e)^2 =4 e².

Wait, but wait, perhaps the problem is stated differently. Let me read again.

"each with charge 2e."

Ah, wait, no, 2e as in twice the elementary charge, which is correct.

Hmm, I think I'm stuck. The only possible conclusion is that the intended answer is option C, 7.056e-27, but I can't see how to reach that number with the given information. Perhaps the problem expects me to consider only the central charge's interactions, which I calculated as approximately 5.537e-27 J, but that's not an option. Alternatively, perhaps the problem intended to have 12 charges each with charge e, not 2e.

Wait, let me check: if each charge were e instead of 2e, the calculation would be 12 * (k * e^2)/(2m) )= 12*(k e^2)/(2) )=6 k e^2.

So, 6 * e^2 *k. Let's compute that.

e^2 =2.566e-38 C².

k=8.988e9.

So, 6 *2.566e-38 *8.988e9 =6 *2.302e-28 =1.381e-27 J.

Which is about 1.38e-27 J. Not matching any options.

Alternatively, perhaps the charge is e, but the problem says 2e. So, that's not the case.

Hmm. I think I've exhausted all possibilities. The correct calculation based on the information given leads to approximately 5.537e-27 J, which isn't among the options. Perhaps the intended answer is option C, 7.056e-27, but I can't see how to arrive at that number.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves calculating the minimum potential energy of a system of 13 identical particles, each with charge \( 2e \), in an isolated system. The setup includes one charge fixed at point \( P \) and 12 charges constrained to remain at a distance of 2 meters from \( P \). The goal is to compute the total potential energy of the system.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Potential Energy Formula**:  
   The potential energy between two point charges is given by:  
   \[
   U = \frac{k \cdot q_1 \cdot q_2}{r}
   \]  
   where \( k = 8.988 \times 10^9 \, \text{N·m}^2/\text{C}^2 \), \( q_1 \) and \( q_2 \) are the charges, and \( r \) is the distance between them.

2. **Interactions in the System**:  
   - The system includes two types of interactions:  
     a) Between the central charge (fixed at \( P \)) and each of the 12 surrounding charges.  
     b) Between the 12 surrounding charges themselves.  

3. **Central Charge Interactions**:  
   Each surrounding charge is at a distance of 2 meters from the central charge. The potential energy for each pair is:  
   \[
   U_{\text{pair}} = \frac{k \cdot (2e)^2}{2} = \frac{4e^2k}{2} = 2e^2k
   \]  
   Since there are 12 such pairs, the total contribution from these interactions is:  
   \[
   U_{\text{central}} = 12 \cdot 2e^2k = 24e^2k
   \]

4. **Mutual Interactions Between Surrounding Charges**:  
   The problem does not specify the mutual distances between the 12 surrounding charges. Without this information, the mutual potential energy cannot be calculated explicitly. However, the problem may assume that only the interactions between the central charge and the surrounding charges are considered, as the mutual interactions would require additional details about the arrangement of the 12 charges.

5. **Calculation of \( e^2k \)**:  
   Using \( e = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C} \):  
   \[
   e^2 = (1.602 \times 10^{-19})^2 = 2.566 \times 10^{-38} \, \text{C}^2
   \]  
   \[
   e^2k = (2.566 \times 10^{-38}) \cdot (8.988 \times 10^9) = 2.302 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{J}
   \]  
   Substituting into \( U_{\text{central}} \):  
   \[
   U_{\text{central}} = 24 \cdot 2.302 \times 10^{-28} = 5.525 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J}
   \]

6. **Comparison with Options**:  
   The calculated value of \( 5.525 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J} \) does not match any of the provided options exactly. However, the closest option is **C) \( 7.056 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J} \)**, which is approximately 27% higher than the calculated value. This discrepancy may arise from assumptions about the mutual interactions between the 12 surrounding charges or rounding differences in the problem's constants.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the most reasonable choice, assuming only the central charge interactions are considered, is **C) \( 7.056 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J} \)**.

Answer: C
