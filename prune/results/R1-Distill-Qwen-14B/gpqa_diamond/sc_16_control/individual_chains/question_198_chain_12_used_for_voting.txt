Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question again carefully.

The problem is about the stability of cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes. We have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate. The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) given are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. The question is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species.

Hmm, I remember that stability constants (formation constants) tell us how stable a complex is. The higher the β, the more stable the complex. So, the complexes with higher β values will form more readily.

The complexes are probably Co(SCN)_n^2- or something similar, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact charges. I think each SCN- is a ligand, so for Co^2+ with n SCN-, the complex would be [Co(SCN)_n]^(2- n) because each SCN- is -1. So, for n=1, it'd be [Co(SCN)]^+, n=2 would be [Co(SCN)_2]^0, and so on.

Wait, but the problem refers to the blue dithiocyanato complex. I think the blue color is for the tetrahedral complex, which is [Co(SCN)_4]^2−, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, I remember that the blue color is associated with the Co(SCN)_4^2- complex, which is the tetrahedral structure. But I'm not 100% certain about that; maybe it's the other way around? Like, the blue is for a different n value.

Wait, the stability constants β are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Stability constants usually increase with the number of ligands, but sometimes they can decrease due to steric hindrance or other factors. So β3 is the highest here, at 63.

Stability constant βn is defined as [Complex]/([Co^2+][SCN^-]^n). So for each complex, [Co(SCN)_n] = βn * [Co^2+] * [SCN^-]^n.

The problem asks for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex. Dithiocyanato would be two SCN- ligands. Or wait, "dithiocyanato" probably refers to two SCN ligands attached. So the complex would be [Co(SCN)_2]^0, which is neutral. So the stability constant β2 is 40.

Wait, but I thought the blue complex was the tetrahedral one with four SCN- ligands. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused between the different Co(SCN)_n complexes.

Alternatively, maybe the blue is for the [Co(SCN)_4]^2- complex, which would be the n=4 case with β4=16. But wait, that's lower than β3=63. That seems counterintuitive because higher β should be more stable. So why would the less stable complex be blue? Maybe I'm mixing up the colors.

Wait, perhaps the different colors correspond to different geometries. The [Co(SCN)_4]^2- is tetrahedral, while [Co(SCN)_6]^4- is octahedral. But I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, I might be thinking of the crystal field splitting, which affects the color. The more ligands, the higher the splitting, perhaps leading to a different color. But I'm not too sure about that.

Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the [Co(SCN)_2]^0 complex as the blue one. In any case, I'll proceed based on the given data.

The task is to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex. Let's assume that the blue complex is the one with n=2, so [Co(SCN)_2]^0, which has β2=40.

But wait, the stability constants are given as β1, β2, β3, β4. So β1 is for n=1: [Co(SCN)]^+, β2 for n=2: [Co(SCN)_2]^0, β3 for n=3: [Co(SCN)_3]^-, and β4 for n=4: [Co(SCN)_4]^2-.

In any case, the approach is to calculate the fraction of each complex relative to the total cobalt species.

The total cobalt concentration is the sum of all the species: Co^2+, [Co(SCN)]^+, [Co(SCN)_2]^0, [Co(SCN)_3]^-, and [Co(SCN)_4]^2-.

Each of these concentrations can be calculated using their respective β values and the concentrations of Co^2+ and SCN^-.

But wait, the problem gives the total cobalt concentration as c(Co) = 1e-2 M. So the sum of all species is 1e-2 M.

So the idea is to calculate the fraction of each complex.

Let me think of the general formula for each complex.

For each n, [Co(SCN)_n] = βn * (Co^2+) * (SCN^-)^n.

But since all these complexes are formed from Co^2+ and SCN^-, the total concentration of Co is the sum of all the complexes and the free Co^2+.

So, [Co_total] = [Co^2+] + sum_{n=1 to 4} [Co(SCN)_n}.

But wait, that's a bit complicated because each complex contributes to the total. So the approach is to set up an equation where x is the free Co^2+ concentration.

Wait, maybe it's easier to express everything in terms of x, the free Co^2+ concentration.

So, [Co^2+] = x.

Then, for each n from 1 to 4, [Co(SCN)_n] = βn * x * (0.1)^n.

Wait, but wait, the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. So [SCN^-] =0.1, assuming that the solution is dilute and that the complexes don't significantly change the total SCN^- concentration. Wait, but if the concentration of Co^2+ is 0.01 M and SCN^- is 0.1 M, which is much higher, the change from complexation might be negligible. So it's probably safe to approximate [SCN^-] as 0.1 M.

So, for each n:

[Co(SCN)_n] = βn * x * (0.1)^n.

And the total cobalt is x + sum_{n=1 to 4} [Co(SCN)_n} ] =0.01.

So, we can write:

x + β1 * x * (0.1) + β2 * x * (0.1)^2 + β3 * x * (0.1)^3 + β4 * x * (0.1)^4 =0.01.

Let me compute each term:

β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

Compute each term:

Term1: Co^2+ =x.

Term2: β1 x (0.1) =9 x *0.1=0.9x.

Term3: β2 x (0.1)^2=40 x * 0.01 =0.4 x.

Term4: β3 x (0.1)^3=63 x *0.001=0.063 x.

Term5: β4 x (0.1)^4=16 x *0.0001=0.0016 x.

Sum all terms: x +0.9x +0.4x +0.063x +0.0016 x = x (1+0.9+0.4+0.063+0.0016) = x * (1.3646).

Wait, 1 +0.9 is 1.9, plus 0.4 is 2.3, plus 0.063 is 2.363, plus 0.0016 is 2.3646.

So, 2.3646 x = 0.01 → x=0.01 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.004225 M.

So, the free Co^2+ is ≈0.004225 M.

Now, compute each complex's concentration:

For n=1: [Co(SCN)]^+ = β1 x (0.1) =9 * 0.004225 *0.1=9 * 0.0004225= 0.0038025 M.

n=2: [Co(SCN)_2]^0 = β2 x (0.1)^2=40 * 0.004225 *0.01=40 * 0.00004225=0.00169 M.

n=3: [Co(SCN)_3}^- =63 *0.004225 * (0.1)^3=63 *0.004225 *0.001=63 * 0.000004225 ≈ 0.0002665 M.

n=4: [Co(SCN)_4]^2- =16 *0.004225 * (0.1)^4=16 *0.004225 *0.0001=16 *0.0000004225≈0.0000676 M.

But wait, let me double-check these calculations.

For n=1, β1=9, so 9 * x * 0.1: x=0.004225, so 9 *0.004225=0.038025, then *0.1 → 0.0038025 M.

n=2: β2=40, 40 *x=40*0.004225=0.169, times (0.1)^2=0.01 → 0.169 *0.01=0.00169.

n=3: β3=63 → 63 *0.004225=0.266625, times (0.1)^3=0.001 → 0.266625 *0.001=0.000266625 M.

n=4: β4=16 →16 *0.004225=0.0676, times (0.1)^4=0.0001 →0.0676 *0.0001=0.00000676 M.

Wait, but that doesn't align with my earlier calculation for n=4, which was 0.0000676. Wait, no, 0.0676 * 0.0001 is 0.00000676. Oh, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me correct that.

Wait, so:

n=1: 9 * 0.004225 * 0.1 = 0.0038025 M.

n=2:40 *0.004225 *0.01=0.00169 M.

n=3:63 *0.004225 *0.001=0.000266625 M.

n=4:16 *0.004225 *0.0001=0.0000676 M.

Wait, wait, no: 16 *0.004225 = 0.0676, then multiply by (0.1)^4 which is 0.0001 → 0.0676 * 0.0001 =0.00000676 M.

Wait, that can't be right. Let me recompute each step:

n=4: β4=16.

So [Co(SCN)_4] =β4 * x * (0.1)^4.

x=0.004225.

So 16 * 0.004225 = 0.0676.

Then 0.0676 * (0.1)^4 → 0.0676 * 0.0001 = 0.00000676 M.

But earlier for n=3, 63 *0.004225 = 0.266625, multiplied by (0.1)^3=0.001 → 0.000266625 M.

So now, the individual concentrations are:

Co^2+ : 0.004225 M.

n=1: 0.0038025.

n=2:0.00169.

n=3:0.000266625.

n=4:0.00000676.

Wait, but the sum of all these should be 0.01 M.

Let me add them all up.

Co^2+ =0.004225.

n=1: 0.0038025.

n=2:0.00169.

n=3:0.000266625.

n=4:0.00000676.

Summing:

0.004225 + 0.0038025=0.0080275.

+0.00169 → 0.0097175.

+0.000266625 →0.009984125.

+0.00000676 →0.009990885.

But the total Co should be 0.01, so I'm getting 0.009990885, which is slightly less. Hmm, possible because I approximated x as 0.004225. Maybe a more precise x would make it sum to exactly 0.01, but for the sake of this problem, perhaps the approximation is sufficient.

Now, the question asks for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex. Let's assume that the blue one is the [Co(SCN)_2]^0 complex, which is n=2. So its concentration is 0.00169 M.

The total cobalt species is 0.01 M.

So the percentage is (0.00169 /0.01)*100= 16.9%.

Wait, but looking at the options, option D is 16.9%.

Wait, but wait, I thought the blue complex was maybe the [Co(SCN)_4]^2- complex, which is n=4. But in that case, its concentration is 0.00000676 M, which is 0.0676 mM. That's 0.00676% of the total. So that's not one of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in identifying the blue complex as n=2. Alternatively, maybe the blue is the most stable complex, which is n=3 (β3=63), which would be [Co(SCN)_3}^-.

Wait, what's the color of each complex? I'm a bit rusty on this, but I think that the [Co(SCN)_4]^2− is blue, while [Co(SCN)_6]^4− is pink. Alternatively, the [Co(SCN)_2]^+ is blue, but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, let me think. In the classic cobalt thiocyanate complexes, the [Co(SCN)_4]^2− is a tetrahedral complex and is blue, while [Co(SCN)_6]^4− is octahedral and is pink. But in this problem, the complexes go up to n=4, so the highest is [Co(SCN)_4]^2−.

Wait, but the problem gives β4=16, which is lower than β3=63. That suggests that the [Co(SCN)_3}^- complex is more stable than the [Co(SCN)_4}^2−, which is a bit counterintuitive because usually adding more ligands increases stability. But perhaps in this case, the fourth ligand doesn't contribute as much, possibly due to steric hindrance or other factors.

So, if the blue complex is [Co(SCN)_4}^2−, which is the n=4 case, its concentration is 0.00000676 M, which would be 0.0676% of the total. That's not one of the options, so probably not. Alternatively, perhaps the blue is the n=2 complex.

Wait, in the given options, 16.9% is option D. And that's the percentage for the n=2 complex. So if the blue complex is n=2, then the answer would be D) 16.9%.

But another possibility is that the blue complex is the most stable one, which is n=3. If the blue is the n=3 complex, then its concentration is 0.000266625 M, which is 2.66625% of the total. That's not an option either.

Alternatively, maybe I'm mistaken about which complex is blue. If the [Co(SCN)_2]^+ is blue, then it's n=1. Its concentration is 0.0038025 M, which is 38.025% of the total. Looking at the options, option C is 38.1%, which is very close. So that would be the answer.

Wait, so now I'm confused. Which one is the blue complex? I think I've made a mistake in assuming which complex is blue.

I think I need to clarify which complex is blue. Let me think about the standard Co(SCN) complexes.

From what I remember, the [Co(SCN)_4]^2− is a tetrahedral complex and is blue. The [Co(SCN)_6]^4− is octahedral and is pink. But in this problem, the complexes go up to n=4, which would be [Co(SCN)_4]^2−. So if the blue is that, then its concentration is 0.00000676 M, which is 0.0676% of the total, which isn't an option. So that can't be right.

Alternatively, perhaps the blue complex is the [Co(SCN)_2]^+ complex, which would be n=1.

Wait, in the options, option C is 38.1%, which is close to 38.025% (about 0.0038 M out of 0.01 M). So that's 38.025% of the total.

Alternatively, perhaps the blue refers to the [Co(SCN)_3}^- complex, which is n=3. But its concentration is 0.000266625 M, which is 2.666% of total, not matching any option.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the initial assumption that the blue complex is the n=2 one is correct, but then the percentage is 16.9%, which is option D.

But I'm getting a bit stuck on identifying which complex is blue. Let me try to look for another approach.

Wait, another approach is to calculate the fraction of each complex and see which one matches an option.

The total concentration of all complexes is 0.01 M.

Each complex's concentration is:

n=1: 0.0038025 → which is 38.025% of total → option C is 38.1%.

n=2: 0.00169 →16.9% → option D.

n=3: 0.000266625 →2.666% → not an option.

n=4:0.00000676 →0.0676% → not an option.

So, the two possibilities are n=1 and n=2.

So, if the blue complex is n=1, the answer is C; if n=2, the answer is D.

But I need to figure out which is correct.

Wait, another thought: the stability constant βn is the formation constant for the nth complex. So, the most stable complex is the one with the highest β. Here, β3=63 is the highest. So the [Co(SCN)_3}^- is the most stable.

But the problem is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex. Dithiocyanato would be two SCN-, so n=2. So the [Co(SCN)_2]^0 complex would be dithiocyanato.

Wait, but that's not necessarily the case. Maybe "dithiocyanato" refers to two SCN groups attached, so n=2.

Alternatively, perhaps "dithiocyanato" refers to the di-substituted complex, but I'm not entirely certain.

If the blue complex is dithiocyanato, which is n=2, then the percentage is 16.9%, which is option D.

But wait, another angle: sometimes the most intense color is not the most stable complex. The β value determines stability, but the color depends on the d-orbital splitting, which can vary with the number of ligands and their field strength.

Alternatively, I think that [Co(SCN)_4]^2− is the blue complex, but in this case, n=4, and β4=16 is lower than β3=63, which suggests that the n=3 complex is more stable. So perhaps the blue complex isn't the most stable. 

Alternatively, perhaps the blue complex is [Co(SCN)_2]^+, which has β1=9. So its concentration is 38.025% of the total, which is option C.

But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem refers to the dithiocyanato as the complex with two SCN ligands, i.e., n=2, which is [Co(SCN)_2]^0. That would correspond to option D (16.9%).

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The problem states "dithiocyanato," which implies two SCN ligands. So the complex in question has two SCN- groups, which is n=2, so the [Co(SCN)_2]^0 complex. So the percentage is 16.9% → option D.

Wait, but wait, the problem asks for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes. So if the blue complex is [Co(SCN)_2]^0 (n=2), the answer is D) 16.9%.

Alternatively, perhaps in this context, the blue is the more common tetrahedral complex, which is [Co(SCN)_4]^2−, which is n=4. But in this case, its concentration is 0.00000676 M, which is negligible, so it's not an option.

But the options include 16.9%, which is the value for n=2.

Hmm. I think I'm going to go with the calculation. The problem states "dithiocyanato" which implies two SCN groups, so n=2. Thus, the percentage is 16.9%, which is option D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species, we analyze the given data. The total cobalt concentration is \( c(\text{Co}) = 10^{-2} \, \text{M} \), and the thiocyanate concentration is \( [\text{SCN}^-] = 0.1 \, \text{M} \). The stability constants for the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are \( \beta_1 = 9 \), \( \beta_2 = 40 \), \( \beta_3 = 63 \), and \( \beta_4 = 16 \).

The total cobalt concentration is distributed among the free \( \text{Co}^{2+} \) ion and its complexes:  
\[
[\text{Co}^{2+}] + [\text{Co(SCN)}^+] + [\text{Co(SCN)_2}] + [\text{Co(SCN)_3}] + [\text{Co(SCN)_4}] = 10^{-2} \, \text{M}.
\]

Using the stability constants, the concentration of each complex can be expressed as:  
\[
[\text{Co(SCN)_n}] = \beta_n \cdot [\text{Co}^{2+}] \cdot [\text{SCN}^-]^n.
\]

Let \( [\text{Co}^{2+}] = x \). Substituting the given \( [\text{SCN}^-] = 0.1 \, \text{M} \), the total cobalt concentration becomes:  
\[
x + \beta_1 \cdot x \cdot (0.1) + \beta_2 \cdot x \cdot (0.1)^2 + \beta_3 \cdot x \cdot (0.1)^3 + \beta_4 \cdot x \cdot (0.1)^4 = 10^{-2}.
\]

Substituting the stability constants \( \beta_1 = 9 \), \( \beta_2 = 40 \), \( \beta_3 = 63 \), \( \beta_4 = 16 \), and simplifying:  
\[
x + 0.9x + 0.4x + 0.063x + 0.0016x = 10^{-2}.
\]  
\[
x(1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016) = 10^{-2}.
\]  
\[
x(2.3646) = 10^{-2}.
\]  
\[
x = \frac{10^{-2}}{2.3646} \approx 0.004225 \, \text{M}.
\]

Now, calculate the concentration of each cobalt complex:  
1. \( [\text{Co(SCN)}^+] = \beta_1 \cdot x \cdot (0.1) = 9 \cdot 0.004225 \cdot 0.1 = 0.0038025 \, \text{M}. \)  
2. \( [\text{Co(SCN)_2}] = \beta_2 \cdot x \cdot (0.1)^2 = 40 \cdot 0.004225 \cdot 0.01 = 0.00169 \, \text{M}. \)  
3. \( [\text{Co(SCN)_3}] = \beta_3 \cdot x \cdot (0.1)^3 = 63 \cdot 0.004225 \cdot 0.001 = 0.000266625 \, \text{M}. \)  
4. \( [\text{Co(SCN)_4}] = \beta_4 \cdot x \cdot (0.1)^4 = 16 \cdot 0.004225 \cdot 0.0001 = 0.00000676 \, \text{M}. \)  

The total cobalt concentration is verified to be approximately \( 10^{-2} \, \text{M} \), confirming the calculations.

The problem specifies the "blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes." The term "dithiocyanato" refers to complexes with two \( \text{SCN}^- \) ligands, which corresponds to \( [\text{Co(SCN)_2}]. \) Its concentration is \( 0.00169 \, \text{M} \). To find the percentage of this complex among all cobalt species:  
\[
\text{Percentage} = \frac{[\text{Co(SCN)_2}]}{\text{Total cobalt concentration}} \cdot 100 = \frac{0.00169}{0.01} \cdot 100 = 16.9\%.
\]

Thus, the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes is **16.9%**, corresponding to option D.

Answer: D
