Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the molecular symmetry group of a product E. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I'll read through the problem again to make sure I understand all the reactions and the information given.

So, solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. Then, C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce product E, which is extremely hazardous. Next, when C reacts with water, it reforms A and produces two different acids, F (a strong acid) and G (a weak acid). Also, D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent.

I think I need to figure out what substances A, B, C, D, etc., are. Once I have their identities, I can determine the structure of E and then its molecular symmetry group.

Let's start by looking for reactions I recognize. When a solid reacts with a gas in a high ratio, maybe it's something like sulfur reacting with something. Wait, solid A reacting with 8 equivalents of gas B to form a red product. Oh, I remember that sulfur (solid) reacts with concentrated nitric acid (maybe gas B is NO2?) but wait, nitric acid is a liquid... Hmm, maybe gas B is chlorine? Or another gas.

Wait, another thought: maybe A is sulfur. When sulfur reacts with something, it can form different products. Oh! Wait, sulfur trioxide is a gas, but maybe that's not right. Alternatively, if B is O2, but that doesn't seem to fit.

Wait, another angle. Let's think about product C. When C reacts with water, it forms A plus two different acids, F (strong) and G (weak). So, when C is reacted with water, it produces two acids. What compounds produce two different acids upon hydrolysis?

Wait, maybe C is a sulfite or sulfate ester? Or perhaps it's a nitride or something else. Alternatively, perhaps C is something like a mixed anhydride.

Wait, but considering that when C reacts with water, it produces two acids, one strong and one weak. Strong acids like HCl, H2SO4, etc. Weak acids like CH3COOH, HCN, etc.

Wait, what about if C is a sulfonamide? No, not sure. Alternatively, maybe C is sodium carbonate, but when it reacts with water, it just produces NaOH and CO2. That's only two products, but both are not acids. Hmm.

Wait another thought: If C is a nitride salt, like NH4NO3? No, but when it reacts with water, it might produce NH3 and HNO3. But that's two products, but both are bases and an acid. Hmm, not matching.

Wait, maybe C is a sulfate ester? Like if A is something like CH3COOH and C is an ester of sulfuric acid. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps C is a nitrate ester. For example, if A is ethanol (CH3CH2OH), and C is an ester like ethyl nitrate. But when esters hydrolyze, they produce carboxylic acids and alcohols. Wait, that's one acid and one alcohol. But the problem says two acids. Hmm, maybe that's not it.

Wait, perhaps C is a sulfonate ester. For example, if A is something like CH3COO- group, and C is CH3COO-SO3-R. When it hydrolyzes, maybe it produces two different acids. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe C is a mixed salt, like a sulfite and another anion. Wait, for instance, if C is NaHSO3 (sodium bisulfite). When it reacts with water, it could produce H2SO3 (which is a weak acid) and NaOH. But that's only one acid. Hmm, not matching.

Wait, perhaps C is a nitrate and something else. Let's think about another approach. Let's look at the reaction where C reacts with D to form E. Also, D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent. H is a solvent, so common solvents include water, ethanol, acetone, etc. But D and B react to form H.

Wait, B is a gas. D is another gas. So their reaction produces a solvent. So maybe B is O2 and D is H2, reacting to form H2O (a solvent). Or perhaps B is Cl2 and D is NH3, reacting to form HCl, but that's a gas, not a solvent. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: D is H2O (a liquid, maybe under certain conditions?), but that's not a gas. Alternatively, perhaps B is H2 and D is Cl2, but then H would be HCl, which is a gas, not a solvent. Hmm, maybe not.

Wait, perhaps B is O2 and D is something else. Let me think about D reacting with B in a 1:1 ratio. If H is a solvent like ethanol, then perhaps D is something that reacts with O2 to produce ethanol. But that seems complicated.

Alternatively, maybe H is NH3, which is a gas, but not a solvent. Hmm. Alternatively, H could be ethylene glycol, but that's not a common solvent for many reactions.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Let me try another angle. Let's think about E being extremely hazardous. What compounds are known for being very dangerous? Maybe something like sarin gas, or other nerve agents. But that's a stretch. Alternatively, perhaps E is something like phosgene, which is highly toxic. But I'm not sure how that fits into the reactions.

Wait, another possibility: E could be a cyanide compound, but I don't see the cyanide in the given reactions. Alternatively, maybe E is a strong acid, but the problem says F is a strong acid. So E must be something else.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the structure of E. If I can figure out what E is, then I can determine its molecular symmetry.

Let me try to list out possible compounds for each product.

Looking at the first reaction: A(s) + 8 B(g) → C(solid maybe? Or a bright red product). Bright red makes me think of substances like mercury(I) oxide (HgO is red), or perhaps some sulfide? Wait, mercury(I) oxide is red, but I'm not sure how it fits.

Wait, another thought: sulfur trioxide is a solid that is colorless, but perhaps another form is red. Alternatively, maybe C is sodium nitrate, but that's white.

Wait, another angle: perhaps C is a mixture of two salts. But that's unclear.

Wait, let's think about the reaction where C is treated with water to produce A, F, and G. So, C + H2O → A + F + G.

If F is a strong acid and G is a weak acid, perhaps C is a salt that upon hydrolysis produces both a strong acid and a weak acid. For example, suppose C is sodium sulfite (Na2SO3), which when hydrolyzed would produce NaOH (strong base) and H2SO3 (weak acid), but that's not two acids.

Alternatively, think about a salt that can hydrolyze into two different acids. Wait, what about sodium acetate hydrolyzes into CH3COOH (weak acid) and NaOH. But that's only one acid.

Wait, another idea: If C is a nitro compound, like nitrobenzene derivatives. No, but not sure.

Wait, what about if C is a sulfate ester or something similar. Alternatively, perhaps C is a mixed carbonate. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the reaction where D and B produce H. Let's think about possible B and D that react in a 1:1 ratio to form a solvent.

Suppose B is O2 and D is something else. For example, D could be CO to form CO2 (but that's a gas). Alternatively, maybe B is H2 and D is Cl2 to form HCl. But HCl is a gas, which doesn't fit as a solvent.

Wait, another possibility: B is NH3, but that's a gas, and D could be something else. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps B is CH4 and D is Cl2, but they don't react in a 1:1 ratio to form a solvent. Hmm.

Wait, another approach. Let's think about D reacting with B to form H, which is a solvent. What reactions form solvents?

One common solvent is ethanol. How can two gases react to form ethanol? Well, ethanol is produced by reacting CO with H2 in a ratio of 1:2, but that's under specific conditions. But the problem says a 1:1 ratio. Hmm, maybe not.

Another solvent is acetone. Acetone is (propanone), which is produced by the oxidation of isopropyl alcohol. But again, not sure about the gases.

Wait, perhaps H is a solvent like water. But water is H2O, which is formed from H2 and O2 in a ratio of 2:1, but the problem says 1:1. So that might not fit.

Wait, another possibility: D and B could be F2 and something else. F2 is a gas, but perhaps reacting with another gas to form something else. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps B is CO2 and D is H2. They could react to form H2O, but that's a liquid under standard conditions. Wait, but H2O can be a solvent. So if B is CO2 and D is H2, then H is H2O. That would be a ratio of 1:1 for CO2 and H2, producing H2O. But I'm not sure if that's a 1:1 molar ratio. Let's see: CO2 + H2 → H2O. Wait, but that's not a balanced equation. Let me check:

CO2 + H2 → H2O + ? For that, the balanced equation would be: CO2 + 2 H2 → 2 H2O + C. No, that doesn't fit because H2 is in excess. Alternatively, maybe another reaction.

Wait, perhaps D is H2 and B is O2, and they form H2O. But the ratio would be 2:1 (H2:O2). The problem states a 1:1 ratio, so that doesn't fit.

Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I should try to think about other possible reactions.

Let me go back to the first reaction: A reacts with 8 equivalents of B to form C. 8 equivalents is a lot, so maybe B is O2, which is diatomic, so perhaps 4 moles of O2 would provide 8 equivalents. So 4 moles of O2 reacting with A to form C.

Wait, sulfur reacting with oxygen. S(s) + O2 → SO3? But SO3 is a gas, not solid. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: maybe A is phosphorus. When P reacts with O2, it forms P4O10, which is a solid. But P4O10 is white, not bright red.

Alternatively, maybe A is iron. Fe reacts with Cl2 to form FeCl3. But I'm not sure about the color.

Wait, let me think about the bright red product. Mercury(I) oxide (HgO) is red, but I'm not sure how that would fit.

Wait, another bright red substance is lead dioxide (PbO2), but again, not sure how that would fit.

Alternatively, maybe it's a sulfide. But sulfides are typically black or another color.

Wait, another possibility: The reaction between sulfur and concentrated nitric acid produces various products. S(s) + HNO3 → products, but that's a liquid, not a gas.

Wait, maybe B is a halogen. For example, Cl2 gas. So A reacts with 8 equivalents of Cl2 to form C.

If A is sulfur, S + Cl2 → SOCl2 or SCl2? Hmm, but SCl2 is a liquid, I think. Alternatively, SOCl2 is a liquid as well. Not sure about the product.

Wait, another angle. Let's think about C reacting with D to form E. If C is something that reacts with D (gas) in a 2:1 ratio, perhaps C is a nitride or another reactive compound.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should consider the molecular symmetry group options and see if any of them correspond to common molecules.

The options are:

A) C2
B) D4h
C) D∞h
D) C2v

These are symmetry groups. D∞h is the symmetry of a linear molecule with an infinite number of planes perpendicular to the axis. For example, CO2 is D∞h? Wait, no, CO2 is linear and has D∞h symmetry. Wait, wait, no, CO2 is linear and has a point group of D∞h. So what if E is CO2? But the problem states that E is extremely hazardous. CO2 isn't that hazardous, but perhaps another gas.

Wait, another possibility: SO2 has a bent structure, which would be D... Hmm, wait, SO2 has a bent structure with a C2v symmetry group. Because it's a bent molecule with a center of inversion? Wait, no, C2v is for a molecule with a C2 axis and two vertical mirror planes. So SO2 would have C2v symmetry.

Wait, but what if E is something like SO2? Let me think.

Let me try to piece together the possible reactions.

Let's suppose that C is sodium sulfite (Na2SO3). Then, when it reacts with D, what would D be? Or perhaps C is NaHSO3. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, another angle: When C reacts with D, it produces E. If E is SO2, then perhaps C is a sulfite ester or something that upon reaction with D (maybe H2SO4) would produce SO2. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, if E is HCl (a strong acid), but F is a strong acid and G is weak. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps E is something more dangerous, like a nerve agent or phosgene. Phosgene is O=C(Cl)2, which is a highly toxic gas. It has a structure similar to O=C(Cl)2. What's the symmetry of phosgene? It's a planar molecule with a C2 axis, so its point group is D∞h? Or is it C2v?

Wait, phosgene (O=C(Cl)2) has a trigonal planar structure. The molecule is planar with a central carbon double-bonded to oxygen and two Cl atoms. So the molecule has a center of inversion and a C2 axis perpendicular to the plane. The symmetry group would be D∞h? Or maybe D2h? Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, maybe it's D∞h because it has an infinite number of planes perpendicular to the C-O axis, but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, an alternative way: if E has a linear structure, like O=C=O (CO2), which is linear and has D∞h symmetry. But if E is a bent molecule, like SO2, then its point group is C2v.

But how does this tie into the reactions?

Let me try to think of possible reactions again. Let's say D is H2SO4 (but that's a liquid, not a gas). Or perhaps D is a chlorine gas.

Wait, when C reacts with D to produce E. If C is sodium sulfite and D is concentrated H2SO4, the reaction would produce SO2 gas. So E would be SO2. Then, SO2 has a bent structure, so its symmetry group is C2v.

Looking back at the options, option D is C2v. So that's possible.

But let me see if this fits the other parts.

So, A reacts with 8 equivalents of B to form C.

If B is Cl2, and A is S (sulfur), then S + Cl2 → SOCl2 or SCl2? Wait, S + Cl2 under certain conditions can form SOCl2 or SCl2. But I'm not sure about the stoichiometry here. Let's say 1 mole of S reacts with 8 moles of Cl2? That might not make sense because S has a valency of 2, so perhaps 1 S + 4 Cl2 → SOCl2 + ... Hmm, maybe this isn't the right approach.

Alternatively, perhaps A is sodium sulfate (Na2SO4). But then reacting with B (Cl2) in a 8 equivalent ratio? Not sure.

Wait, another angle: Let's think about C reacting with water. If C is Na2SO3 (sodium sulfite), then Na2SO3 + H2O → 2 NaOH + H2SO3. But H2SO3 is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base, but the problem states that F is a strong acid and G is a weak acid. So maybe this isn't fitting.

Alternatively, if C is NaHSO3 (sodium bisulfite), then reacting with water would produce H2SO3 and NaOH? Not sure.

Wait, perhaps C is a nitrate salt. For example, NaNO3. When it reacts with water, it doesn't produce acids, so that's not right.

Wait, another thought: If C is a chloride salt, like AlCl3. But when AlCl3 reacts with water, it hydrolyzes to form HCl (strong acid) and Al(OH)3. That would fit because F is a strong acid (HCl) and G is a weak acid (Al(OH)3 doesn't produce a weak acid, but rather a weak base. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, perhaps C is a carbonate, like Na2CO3. When it reacts with water, it forms NaOH and CO2. But CO2 is a gas, not an acid. So that's not matching.

Wait, another possibility: C is a phosphate salt. For example, Na3PO4. Reacting with water doesn't produce acids.

Hmm, I'm stuck again. Maybe I should think about the reaction where D and B form H.

If H is a solvent, and D and B react in a 1:1 ratio, perhaps H is a diol or something like that. Or H could be something like ethanol.

Wait, if B is H2O (but it's a liquid, not a gas), but in the problem, B is a gas. Alternatively, B could be O2, D could be H2. Then H is H2O. But the stoichiometry for H2O is 2 H2 + O2 → 2 H2O. So ratio is 2:1, but the problem states 1:1. So that may not fit.

Wait, another approach: Let's say B is NH3 and D is HCl. Then, NH3 + HCl → NH4Cl, which is a solid, but not a solvent. Or perhaps H is a liquid ammonia solution? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps B is CO2 and D is H2. They react to form H2O. But again, the stoichiometry would be 1 CO2 + 2 H2 → 2 H2O + C. Not matching 1:1.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to make some assumptions.

Assume that C is a sulfite salt, like Na2SO3. Then, when C reacts with D (maybe H2SO4), it produces SO2 (E) as a byproduct. But I'm not sure.

Wait, let me try to retrace:

1. A + 8 B → C (bright red)
2. C + 2 D → E (extremely hazardous)
3. C + H2O → A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid)
4. B + D → H (solvent, 1:1)

If E is SO2, which has a point group of C2v, then option D would be correct. But I need to see if the other reactions fit.

Let me suppose that:

- B is O2 (gas)
- A is sulfur (solid)
- Reaction 1: S(s) + O2 → SO3(g) ? But SO3 is a gas, and the product C is solid? Not sure.

Alternatively, C could be a solid oxide. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe C is Na2O2 (sodium peroxide), which is a bright yellow solid, but not red. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: Perhaps C is a nitro compound. For example, if A is an amine, and B is nitric acid. But not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should look for a reaction where when a solid reacts with a gas to form a bright red product. Mercury(I) oxide (HgO) is red. So, perhaps A is Hg metal, B is O2, and C is HgO.

Then, HgO (C) reacts with D (maybe HCl gas) to form HgCl2 (E). Wait, HgCl2 is mercurous chloride, which is a strong irritant, but is it extremely hazardous? Not as much as some others. Alternatively, perhaps E is HCl gas, but that's a gas, not a solid.

Alternatively, C (HgO) reacts with D to form something else. Or, perhaps another reaction.

Wait, HgO + H2SO4 → HgSO4 + H2O. But I'm not sure if that's right.

Alternatively, if HgO is treated with HCl, it forms HgCl2 and water. So E would be HgCl2. But not sure about the symmetry of HgCl2.

HgCl2 has a structure where the Hg is in the +2 oxidation state, with two Cl atoms. It's a linear molecule? Or a bent structure? I think HgCl2 is a linear molecule with a structure similar to CO2, so it would have D∞h symmetry. But that's just a guess.

Wait, but earlier I thought that E might be SO2, which has C2v symmetry. But this is speculative.

Let me think about the other reactions. If C is HgO, then when it reacts with water:

HgO + H2O → Hg(OH)2. Wait, but Hg(OH)2 decomposes into HgO·H2O and other products. Hmm, not sure about that.

Alternatively, perhaps HgO reacts with water to form Hg(OH)2, which is a weak base. But the problem says that two acids F and G are formed. So maybe HgO isn't the right fit.

Hmm, this seems to be taking a long time. Let me think about another approach.

The product E is extremely hazardous, which makes me think of things like sarin, VX, or other nerve agents. But I don't have enough information about those structures to proceed.

Alternatively, perhaps E is phosgene (O=CCl2), which is a highly toxic gas. The structure of phosgene is O=C(Cl)2. It's a planar molecule with a C2 axis perpendicular to the plane of the molecule. The point group would be D∞h because it has an infinite number of mirror planes perpendicular to the C2 axis. Wait, no, actually, phosgene has a D∞h symmetry because it's linear in the sense that there are multiple planes of symmetry. But wait, phosgene has a central C atom double-bonded to O and single-bonded to two Cl atoms. So it's a trigonal planar molecule. The symmetry group for O=C(Cl)2 is D∞h, I think.

Wait, but wait, D∞h requires an infinite number of symmetry planes. For phosgene, which is O=C(Cl)2, the point group is actually D∞h because the molecule is linear in structure with a central C atom, and the two Cl atoms are symmetrically placed. Alternatively, maybe it's D2h. Hmm, I'm a bit confused.

Wait, another possibility: E is HCN, which is a linear molecule (H-C≡N), so it has D∞h symmetry. But HCN isn't extremely hazardous in the same way as phosgene or sarin.

Alternatively, perhaps E is Cl2, which is a diatomic molecule with D∞h symmetry. But Cl2 isn't extremely hazardous in a way that's implied here.

Wait, another thought: E could be SO2, which is a bent molecule. Its point group is C2v because it has a C2 axis (180-degree rotation) and two mirror planes that include the bond axis and bisect the angle between the two oxygen atoms.

If E is SO2, then its point group is C2v, which is option D.

Let me see if this fits into the reactions.

Assuming E is SO2:

- C reacts with D to form SO2. So, C could be sodium sulfite (Na2SO3), and D could be H2SO4. Then, the reaction would be:

Na2SO3 + H2SO4 → Na2SO4 + SO2 + H2O.

That makes sense. So C is Na2SO3, D is H2SO4.

Then, when C (Na2SO3) reacts with water, it would hydrolyze to form NaOH (strong base) and H2SO3 (which is a weak acid). Wait, but the problem says F is a strong acid and G is a weak acid. So NaOH is a strong base, not an acid. Hmm, that's a problem.

Alternatively, perhaps C is NaHSO3. Then, NaHSO3 + H2O → NaOH + H2SO3. Again, same issue.

Wait, maybe C is a different sulfite. Alternatively, perhaps C is a different salt altogether.

Alternatively, if C is (NH4)2SO3, then reacting with water would produce NH4OH (a weak acid, ammonium hydroxide) and H2SO3 (weak acid). But that's two weak acids, which doesn't fit.

Hmm, this is tricky. Maybe I should think about another possibility where the hydrolysis produces a strong acid and a weak acid.

Wait, what about if C is a mixed carbonate and sulfite? Like Na2SO3·Na2CO3. When it reacts with water, it might produce both H2SO3 and H2CO3. H2SO3 is a weak acid, and H2CO3 is also a weak acid, but not a strong one. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, another possibility: C is NaNO3. When it reacts with water, it doesn't produce any acids, so that's not right.

Alternatively, maybe C is a nitrate salt. Wait, sodium nitrate (NaNO3) reacts with water to form HNO3 (strong acid) and NaOH (strong base). Hmm, that could fit because F is a strong acid (HNO3) and G is a strong base, but G is supposed to be a weak acid. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps C is a sulfonate ester. For example, if C is CH3SO3Na (sodium methyl sulfonate). When it reacts with water, it would hydrolyze to produce H2SO3 (weak acid) and CH3OH (which is a weak acid, but more of an alcohol). Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a phosphate salt. For example, NaH2PO4. When it reacts with water, it might produce H3PO4 (weak acid) and NaOH. Hmm, again, NaOH is a strong base, not an acid.

Wait, maybe C is a mix of two salts that upon hydrolysis produce different acids. For example, if C is a mixture of NaHSO3 and NaCl, but that's stretching it.

Alternatively, perhaps C is something like CaCl2. When CaCl2 reacts with water, it produces HCl (strong acid) and Ca(OH)2 (weak base). But that's an acid and a base, not two acids. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me list out possible substances and their reactions.

If E is SO2 (which is a toxic gas), and it's formed from C reacting with D, which could be H2SO4.

Then, C is Na2SO3. When Na2SO3 reacts with H2SO4, it produces Na2SO4, SO2, and H2O.

Now, when Na2SO3 reacts with water, it hydrolyzes to form 2 NaOH and H2SO3. But NaOH is a strong base, not an acid. So F and G are supposed to be acids, but here we have a base. Hmm, not matching.

Wait, another approach: maybe C is a sulfite ester, like methyl sulfite, which upon hydrolysis would produce H2SO3 and an alcohol. But the problem states that two acids are formed, not an acid and an alcohol.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a polymeric structure that upon hydrolysis yields two different acids. I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps C is a metal sulfite, like CuSO3. When it reacts with water, it might form Cu(OH)2 and H2SO3. But again, that's a base and an acid, not two acids.

Alternatively, maybe C is a salt of a strong acid and a weak acid. For example, if C is Na2HPO4, which upon hydrolysis would produce H3PO4 (weak acid) and NaOH (strong base). Again, not matching.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's make an assumption and see if it holds.

Assume that E is SO2, which has a point group of C2v.

So the answer would be option D.

But let me check the other parts:

- If E is SO2, then C could be Na2SO3, D could be H2SO4.

- Then, when C (Na2SO3) reacts with water, it forms NaOH (strong base) and H2SO3 (weak acid). But the problem says F and G are acids, not a base and an acid. So this doesn't fit.

Hmm, that's a problem. So maybe E isn't SO2.

Let me think differently. If F is a strong acid and G is a weak acid, when C reacts with water, perhaps C is a nitrite salt. For example, NaNO2.

When NaNO2 reacts with water, it might hydrolyze to form HNO2 (weak acid) and NaOH (strong base), but again, that's a base and an acid.

Hmm.

Wait, another thought: Maybe C is a sulfonic acid ester. For example, if C is CH3SO3Na (sodium methyl sulfonate), upon hydrolysis, it would produce H2SO3 (weak acid) and CH3OH (which is a weak acid? No, it's an alcohol, a weak base perhaps). So again, doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps C is a mixed anhydride. For example, if C is (CH3COO)2SO4, which upon hydrolysis would produce H2SO4 (strong acid) and CH3COOH (weak acid). That would fit because F is strong and G is weak.

If that's the case, then:

C is (CH3COO)2SO4.

Then, when C reacts with D, it produces E. Let's say D is something that would break down the anhydride. Maybe D is a strong acid catalyst, but not sure.

Alternatively, if C reacts with a strong acid like H2SO4, it might generate something else.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think about the reaction where C reacts with D to form E.

If D is a strong acid, like H2SO4, then perhaps:

(CH3COO)2SO4 + H2SO4 → 2 CH3COOH + SO2↑ + H2O.

Wait, that's a possible reaction. Then, E would be SO2 again.

So, if E is SO2, which has C2v symmetry, then the answer would be D.

But let's check the other reactions:

- A reacts with 8 equivalents of B to form C.

If C is (CH3COO)2SO4, then A could be (CH3COO)2S, which is an anhydride as well. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps A is something else. Let me think: (CH3COO)2SO4 is formed from two equivalents of CH3COOH and one equivalent of H2SO4. Not sure.

Wait, perhaps B is H2O. But B is a gas, so that's not possible.

Alternatively, B could be O2, and A is CH3COOH. But I'm not sure.

Hmm, this is getting too tangled. Let's try to proceed with the assumption that E is SO2, which has a point group of C2v. Therefore, the answer would be option D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves determining the molecular symmetry group of product E, which is described as extremely hazardous. To solve this, the reactions and properties of the substances involved are analyzed step by step.

1. **Reaction Analysis**:  
   - Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C.  
   - C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce E.  
   - C reacts with water to reform A and produce two acids, F (strong acid) and G (weak acid).  
   - D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent.

2. **Key Observations**:  
   - The bright red product C suggests it could be a sulfite or related compound.  
   - The reaction of C with water producing two acids (one strong and one weak) indicates C is likely a sulfite salt, such as Na2SO3 or (CH3COO)2SO4.  
   - The reaction of C with D to form E, which is extremely hazardous, suggests E could be a toxic gas like SO2 or phosgene.  

3. **Symmetry Group of E**:  
   - If E is SO2, it is a bent molecule with a C2v symmetry group.  
   - If E is phosgene (O=C(Cl)2), it is a planar molecule with D∞h symmetry.  
   - Given the description of E as extremely hazardous, SO2 is a plausible candidate, as it is a toxic gas with a bent structure and C2v symmetry.  

4. **Consistency Check**:  
   - Assuming E is SO2, C could be Na2SO3, and D could be H2SO4. The reaction Na2SO3 + H2SO4 → Na2SO4 + SO2 + H2O fits the stoichiometry.  
   - When C (Na2SO3) reacts with water, it hydrolyzes to form NaOH (strong base) and H2SO3 (weak acid). However, the problem specifies two acids, so this assumption may not fully align.  
   - Despite this, the symmetry group of SO2 remains consistent with the given options.  

Based on the analysis, the molecular symmetry group of E is **C2v**, corresponding to a bent molecule like SO2. 

Answer: D
