Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says we have a solution with a volume of 200.00 cm³ (which is 0.2 liters, right?) containing 1.00 g of KH₂PO₄ and 1.00 g of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O. We need to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions in this solution. The temperatures are at 25°C, and the Ka values for H3PO4 are given as Ka1 = 7.5e-3, Ka2 = 6.2e-8, and Ka3 = 1.8e-12.

Hmm, orthophosphate ions are PO₄³⁻, I think. So I need to figure out the concentration of PO₄³⁻ in the solution.

Wait, but first, let me think about the salts we're adding. KH₂PO₄ is potassium hydrogen phosphate. When it dissolves, it dissociates into K⁺, H₂PO₄⁻. And Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O is sodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate. When that dissolves, it should give Na⁺ and HPO₄²⁻ ions, right? Because Na₂HPO₄ dissociates into 2Na⁺ and HPO₄²⁻.

So the solution contains H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻. Now, these are conjugate acid-base pairs, I remember. H₂PO₄⁻ is the acid, and HPO₄²⁻ is the conjugate base. So the system might be a buffer solution.

Wait a second, the presence of both H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻ suggests that they can act as a buffer. The pH of the solution would be determined by the pKa of the second dissociation, since H₂PO₄⁻ is the acid and HPO₄²⁻ is the conjugate base. Oh wait, wait, no. Wait, H3PO4 is triprotic. Its first dissociation is H3PO4 → H+ + H2PO4⁻. The second is H2PO4⁻ ↔ H+ + HPO4²⁻, and the third is HPO4²⁻ ↔ H+ + PO4³⁻. So the second dissociation has a Ka2 of 6.2e-8.

Wait, but in the solution, we have H2PO4⁻ (from KH2PO4) and HPO4^2- (from Na2HPO4). So these two are in the same solution. So this is a buffer system involving H2PO4⁻ and HPO4^2-.

So the pH of the solution will be determined by the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, using the pKa2. Because the reaction is H2PO4⁻ ↔ H+ + HPO4^2-.

So, the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]). Here, the base is HPO4^2- and the acid is H2PO4⁻.

But wait, actually, wait. The base is HPO4^2- because it can accept a proton to become H2PO4⁻. Or wait, in the buffer, the acid is H2PO4⁻ (which donates a proton to become HPO4²⁻), and the base is HPO4²⁻ (which can accept a proton to become H2PO4⁻). So in the equation, [base] is [HPO4²⁻], and [acid] is [H2PO4⁻].

So first, I need to calculate the concentrations of H2PO4⁻ and HPO4²⁻ in the solution.

Let me start by finding the moles of each salt.

For KH₂PO₄: mass is 1.00 g, molar mass is 136.09 g/mol.

Moles = mass / molar mass = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol ≈ 0.007352 mol.

Similarly for Na₂HPO4·2H2O: mass is 1.00 g, molar mass is 177.99 g/mol.

Moles = 1.00 / 177.99 ≈ 0.005604 mol.

Wait, but wait, each mole of KH₂PO₄ gives one mole of H₂PO₄⁻, correct? Because when KH₂PO₄ dissolves, it's K+ and H₂PO₄⁻.

Similarly, each mole of Na₂HPO4·2H2O gives one mole of HPO4²⁻, because Na2HPO4 → 2Na+ + HPO4²⁻.

So the concentration of H₂PO₄⁻ is (0.007352 mol) / 0.2 L = 0.03676 M.

And concentration of HPO4²⁻ is (0.005604 mol) / 0.2 L = 0.02802 M.

Wait, but wait, wait a minute. No, wait, wait— no, because the solution is 200 cm³, which is 0.2 L. So when you have 1.00g of each, their moles are as calculated.

So, [H2PO4^-] = 0.007352 / 0.2 = 0.03676 M.

[HPO4^2-] = 0.005604 / 0.2 = 0.02802 M.

Then, using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-])

Ka2 is 6.2e-8, so pKa2 = log(1/(6.2e-8)) → wait, pKa is -log(Ka). So pKa2 = -log(6.2e-8) ≈ 7.207.

Wait, let me calculate that more accurately.

Ka2 = 6.2e-8 → pKa2 = log(1/(6.2e-8)) is incorrect, wait, no. pKa is -log10(Ka). So pKa2 = -log(6.2e-8) = log(1/(6.2e-8)) is the same as -log(6.2e-8). Let me compute this.

Log(6.2) is about 0.7924. So log(6.2e-8) is 0.7924 - 8 = -7.2076. So pKa2 is 7.2076.

So, pH = 7.2076 + log( (0.02802) / (0.03676) )

Compute the ratio: 0.02802 / 0.03676 ≈ 0.7628.

Log(0.7628) is about -0.117.

So pH ≈ 7.2076 - 0.117 = 7.0906.

Wait, but the problem isn't asking for pH, but the concentration of orthophosphate ions, PO4³−. Hmm, but how?

Wait, orthophosphate is PO4³−, which is the deprotonated form of HPO4^2−. So to find [PO4^3−], we need to consider the third dissociation step. Because HPO4^2− can lose another proton to become PO4^3−.

The third dissociation has a Ka3 of 1.8e-12. So the reaction is HPO4^2− ↔ H+ + PO4^3−.

At pH 7.09, which is lower than pKa3. Because pKa3 is -log(1.8e-12) ≈ 11.74.

Since pH is 7.09, which is much lower than pKa3, the solution is acidic enough that the HPO4^2− will tend to stay protonated, meaning PO4^3− concentration will be very low. Because when pH < pKa, the acid form (HPO4^2−) is favored, so the base form (PO4^3−) is minimal.

But wait, perhaps I can use the third dissociation to find [PO4^3−].

The formula is Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3−] / [HPO4^2−].

We can rearrange this to find [PO4^3−] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2−]) / [H+].

We have Ka3 = 1.8e-12.

[HPO4^2−] is 0.02802 M, but wait, no— wait, no, because in the solution, the HPO4^2− from Na2HPO4 might be in equilibrium with PO4^3−. But I think the majority will remain as HPO4^2−, with a small amount converting to PO4^3−.

But wait, our solution has both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2−, and the pH is around 7.09, which is below pKa3 (11.74), so the solution is on the acidic side relative to the third dissociation. So the concentration of PO4^3− would be very low.

But to find [PO4^3−], I need to consider the third dissociation.

So, let's compute [PO4^3−].

We have:

Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3−]/[HPO4^2−]

We can find [H+] from the pH we calculated earlier, which is 7.0906. So [H+] = 10^(-pH) = 10^(-7.0906) ≈ 8.31e-8 M.

Wait, let's compute that more accurately. 10^(-7.09) is about 8.3e-8, yes.

So, rearranging the equation:

[PO4^3−] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2−]) / [H+]

Plugging in the numbers:

Ka3 = 1.8e-12.

[HPO4^2−] is 0.02802 M. Wait, no, wait. Wait, in the solution, the HPO4^2− comes from the Na2HPO4, which is 0.005604 mol in 0.2 L, so 0.02802 M. But wait, in the buffer solution, the actual concentration of HPO4^2− might be lower because some of it has dissociated into PO4^3−. Hmm, but I think for an initial approximation, we can treat [HPO4^2−] as 0.02802 M because the amount that dissociates into PO4^3− is very small. So maybe this approximation is acceptable.

So,

[PO4^3−] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02802) / (8.31e-8)

Let me compute the numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.02802 = 5.0436e-14.

Denominator: 8.31e-8.

So 5.0436e-14 / 8.31e-8 ≈ 6.07e-7.

Wait, 5.0436 / 8.31 is approximately 0.607 (since 8.31 * 0.6 is about 4.986, and 8.31 *0.607 is about 5.043). So 0.607e-7 → 6.07e-8? Wait wait, no:

Wait, 5.0436e-14 divided by 8.31e-8 is (5.0436 /8.31) ) * 1e-6. Because 1e-14 /1e-8 = 1e-6.

So 5.0436 /8.31 = approximately 0.606.

So 0.606e-6 → 6.06e-7 M.

Wait, that's 6.06e-7 M. Looking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7, which is close. But wait, perhaps I made some approximation, let me check the exact calculations.

Wait, maybe I should compute the [H+] more accurately.

Earlier, I had pH ≈ 7.0906, so [H+] = 10^(-7.0906).

Let me compute that more precisely. 10^(-7.0906) = 10^(-7) * 10^(-0.0906). 10^(-7) is 1e-7. 10^(-0.0906) is approximately 0.886, because 10^(-0.09)= about 0.886. So 1e-7 * 0.886 = 8.86e-8.

Wait, that's more precise. So [H+] is approximately 8.86e-8 M.

So let's recalculate:

[PO4^3−] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02802) / 8.86e-8.

Compute numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.02802 = 5.0436e-14.

Denominator: 8.86e-8.

So [PO4^3−] = (5.0436e-14) / (8.86e-8) = (5.0436 /8.86) * 1e-6.

5.0436 /8.86 is about 0.5693.

So 0.5693e-6 → 5.693e-7 M.

Looking at the options, option B is 5.48e-7, which is close. Hmm, but wait, maybe the initial approximation of [HPO4^2−] as 0.02802 M isn't accurate because some of it has dissociated into PO4^3−. Alternatively, perhaps the buffer solution's pH affects this.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the HPO4^2− exists in equilibrium with PO4^3−, and the concentration of HPO4^2− is not exactly 0.02802 M. But given that Ka3 is so small (1.8e-12), the extent of dissociation is negligible, so the initial approximation holds.

Alternatively, perhaps the total phosphate species includes HPO4^2−, H2PO4^-, and PO4^3−, but given that Ka3 is so small, PO4^3− is negligible compared to HPO4^2−.

Wait, but wait another point: the amount of PO4^3− we calculated is about 5.69e-7 M, which is option B (5.48e-7) or option A (6.24e-7). Hmm, but why is there a discrepancy?

Wait, maybe I should calculate more accurately. Let me recompute without approximation.

First, moles of KH2PO4: 1.00g /136.09g/mol = 0.007352 mol.

Moles of Na2HPO4·2H2O: 1.00g /177.99g/mol = 0.005604 mol.

Volume is 0.2 L, so concentrations:

[H2PO4^-] = 0.007352 /0.2 = 0.03676 M.

[HPO4^2−] = 0.005604 /0.2 = 0.02802 M.

pH using Henderson-Hasselbalch:

pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2−]/[H2PO4^-])

pKa2 = -log(6.2e-8) ≈ 7.207.

Ratio = 0.02802 / 0.03676 ≈ 0.7628.

Log(0.7628) ≈ -0.1168.

So pH = 7.207 - 0.1168 = 7.0902.

[H+] = 10^-7.0902 ≈ 8.31e-8 M.

Now, for PO4^3−:

Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3−]/[HPO4^2−]

=> [PO4^3−] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2−]) / [H+]

Plugging in the numbers:

Ka3 = 1.8e-12.

[HPO4^2−] = 0.02802 M.

[H+] = 8.31e-8 M.

So,

(1.8e-12) * 0.02802 = 5.0436e-14.

Divide by 8.31e-8: 5.0436e-14 /8.31e-8 = (5.0436 /8.31) * 1e-6.

5.0436 ÷ 8.31 ≈ 0.6067.

So 0.6067e-6 = 6.067e-7 M.

Wait, that's about 6.07e-7 M. But the options don't have that. The options are A) 6.24e-7, B)5.48e-7, etc.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in approximating [HPO4^2−] as 0.02802 M. Maybe I should consider that some of the HPO4^2− has dissociated into PO4^3−, which would reduce [HPO4^2−], thereby increasing [PO4^3−]. But since Ka3 is so small, this effect is minimal, but perhaps not negligible enough.

Alternatively, perhaps the total concentration of phosphate species is the sum of [H2PO4^-], [HPO4^2−], and [PO4^3−], but the problem is that the initial concentrations are from the salts, and the PO4^3− comes from the dissociation.

Wait, but perhaps the initial assumption of [HPO4^2−] being 0.02802 M is incorrect because some of it converts to PO4^3−. So perhaps the actual [HPO4^2−] is less than 0.02802 M, so the [PO4^3−] would be a bit higher than our initial calculation.

Wait, but given the small Ka3, the change would be minimal. Let me think about it.

Let me denote x as [PO4^3−]. Then, the change in [HPO4^2−] would be x, because for every mole of HPO4^2− that dissociates, one mole of PO4^3− is produced.

So, [HPO4^2−] = 0.02802 - x ≈ 0.02802 (since x is very small).

So, [PO4^3−] = x.

Then, Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3−]/[HPO4^2−] = (8.31e-8)(x) / (0.02802 - x) ≈ (8.31e-8 x) / 0.02802.

So,

x ≈ (Ka3 * 0.02802) / (8.31e-8).

Which is the same as before, so x ≈ 6.07e-7 M. So this doesn't change the result much.

Wait, but why is my calculation leading to 6.07e-7, but the options don't have that. The closest is option A (6.24e-7) and option D (3.97e-7). Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me recheck the numbers:

Moles of KH2PO4: 1.00g / 136.09 g/mol = let's compute that accurately.

136.09 is approx 136.1.

1.00 /136.09 ≈ 0.007349 mol.

Similarly, Na2HPO4·2H2O: 1.00 /177.99 ≈ 0.005604 mol.

So, in 0.2 L, [H2PO4^-] = 0.007349 /0.2 = 0.036745 M.

[HPO4^2−] = 0.005604 /0.2 = 0.02802 M.

Ka2 is 6.2e-8. So pKa2 is log(6.2e-8) = log(6.2) + log(1e-8).

Wait, log(6.2e-8) is log(6.2) + log(1e-8) ) → 0.7924 -8 → -7.2076. So pKa2 is 7.2076.

So pH = 7.2076 + log(0.02802/0.036745).

0.02802 /0.036745 ≈ 0.7628.

Log(0.7628) ≈ -0.1168.

So pH ≈ 7.2076 -0.1168 =7.0908.

[H+] = 10^-7.0908 ≈ 8.31e-8 M.

So, [PO4^3−] = (1.8e-12 *0.02802) /8.31e-8.

Compute numerator: 1.8e-12 *0.02802 = 5.0436e-14.

Denominator: 8.31e-8.

So 5.0436e-14 /8.31e-8 = 5.0436/(8.31) * 1e-6.

5.0436 /8.31 ≈ 0.6067.

So 0.6067e-6 → 6.067e-7 M.

So PO4^3− is approximately 6.07e-7 M.

Looking back at the options:

A) 6.24e-7

B)5.48e-7

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of [H+]. Let me compute [H+] accurately.

pH is 7.0908 → [H+] = 10^-7.0908.

Using a calculator, 10^(-7.0908) = 10^(-7 -0.0908) = 10^(-7) * 10^(-0.0908).

10^(-7) is 1e-7.

10^(-0.0908) → ln(10^x) = x ln10. So ln(10^(-0.0908)) = -0.0908 * ln10 ≈ -0.0908 *2.302585 ≈ -0.209.

So e^(-0.209) ≈ 0.811.

So 10^(-0.0908) ≈ 0.811. So [H+] ≈ 1e-7 *0.811 = 8.11e-8 M.

So,

[PO4^3−] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02802) /8.11e-8.

Compute numerator: 1.8e-12 *0.02802 =5.0436e-14.

Denominator:8.11e-8.

So 5.0436e-14 /8.11e-8 = (5.0436/8.11) *1e-6.

5.0436/8.11 ≈ 0.6218.

So 0.6218e-6 →6.218e-7 M.

Which is approximately 6.22e-7 M. The closest option is A) 6.24e-7.

Wait, but why did the prior calculation with [H+] =8.31e-8 give 6.07e-7, and with [H+] =8.11e-8 gives 6.22e-7. Hmm, perhaps I should calculate [H+] more accurately.

Wait, let me compute 10^(-7.0908) more precisely.

Using logarithm tables is impractical, but perhaps I can use a calculator-like approach.

Wait, 7.0908 is the pH. So 10^(-7.0908) = 10^(-7)*10^(-0.0908).

We can compute 10^(-0.0908) as follows.

We know that log(8)=0.9031, so 10^0.9031=8.

But we need 10^(-0.0908).

Wait, using the approximation for small x: 10^x ≈1 + x*ln(10).

But x is -0.0908, which is small but not negligible. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps using the Taylor series expansion for 10^x around x=0.

But perhaps it's easier to use natural logs.

Wait, 10^x = e^{x ln 10}.

So, x = -0.0908 → x ln10 ≈ -0.0908 *2.302585 ≈-0.2091.

e^(-0.2091) ≈ 1 -0.2091 + (0.2091^2)/2 - (0.2091^3)/6.

Compute:

0.2091^2 ≈ 0.0437, so 0.0437/2 = 0.02185.

0.2091^3 ≈ 0.2091 * 0.0437 ≈ 0.00909, so 0.00909/6 ≈ 0.001515.

So,

e^(-0.2091) ≈ 1 -0.2091 +0.02185 -0.001515.

= 1 -0.2091 = 0.7909.

0.7909 +0.02185 =0.81275.

0.81275 -0.001515=0.8112.

So 10^(-0.0908)=~0.8112.

So [H+] = 1e-7 *0.8112 =8.112e-8 M.

Thus, [PO4^3−] = (1.8e-12 *0.02802)/(8.112e-8) = ?

Compute numerator: 1.8e-12 *0.02802 =5.0436e-14.

Divide by 8.112e-8:

5.0436e-14 /8.112e-8 = (5.0436/8.112) * 1e-6.

5.0436 ÷8.112 ≈ 0.6215.

So 0.6215e-6 →6.215e-7 M.

Which is approximately 6.22e-7 M. So option A is 6.24e-7, which is very close.

Wait, but wait another thing: perhaps the solution hasn't fully considered the exact concentrations. Or perhaps I should account for the contribution of H+ from other sources, but I think that's negligible.

Another possibility: when calculating the pH using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, perhaps I should have considered that the solution is a buffer, but perhaps with more accurate calculations.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial calculation of the pH is correct, but perhaps I should do a more precise calculation of the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.

Let me recompute the pH with more precision.

The ratio [HPO4^2−]/[H2PO4^-] = 0.02802 / 0.036745 = 0.7628.

Log(0.7628) → let me compute it more accurately.

We know that log(0.7)= -0.1549, log(0.76)= -0.1170, log(0.7628)=?

Using a calculator approach: 0.7628 is between 0.76 and 0.77.

We can compute log(0.7628) using linear approximation.

At x=0.76, log= -0.1170.

At x=0.77, log= let's compute it.

Wait, perhaps it's better to use the exact value.

Alternatively, use natural logarithm and convert.

ln(0.7628) = -0.268.

Because ln(0.7628) ≈ -0.268.

Then log(0.7628) = ln(0.7628)/(ln10) → -0.268 /2.3026 ≈-0.1163.

So log(0.7628) ≈-0.1163.

So pH =7.2076 -0.1163=7.0913.

So [H+] =10^-7.0913.

Which is 10^(-7) *10^(-0.0913)=1e-7 * (approx 0.81).

So 8.1e-8 M.

Wait, but let's compute 10^(-0.0913) exactly.

We can compute it as e^(-0.0913 * ln10) = e^(-0.0913 *2.302585) → e^(-0.2099).

We know that e^(-0.2) ≈0.8187.

e^(-0.2099)=approx 0.811.

So [H+] =8.11e-8.

So, recalculating [PO4^3−]:

(1.8e-12 *0.02802)/(8.11e-8) =5.0436e-14 /8.11e-8 =5.0436/(8.11) *1e-6.

5.0436 /8.11 ≈0.6218.

So 0.6218e-6 →6.218e-7 M.

So approximately 6.22e-7 M, which is very close to option A (6.24e-7).

Wait, but in the options, option A is 6.24e-7, which is a little higher than my calculation.

Hmmm. Maybe I made a miscalculation in the moles.

Wait, let me recheck the moles.

For KH2PO4: 1.00g /136.09 g/mol.

Let me compute 136.09 *0.007352 = approximately 1.00g.

Wait, 136.09 *0.007352 = ?

0.007352 *100=0.7352 → 0.7352 *1.3609 = ?

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute 1.00g /136.09.

Wait, 136.09 × 0.007352 = 1.000 g? Let's see:

0.007352 *136.09 = ?

Let me compute 0.007352 × 136.09.

0.007352 ×100=0.7352
0.007352 ×30=0.22056
0.007352 ×6.09=0.04473 (approx)

Adding up: 0.7352 + 0.22056 =0.95576 +0.04473=1.0005. So yes, 0.007352 mol of KH2PO4 is 1.0005g, close enough.

Similarly, Na2HPO4·2H2O: 177.99 g/mol.

1.00g /177.99 = approx 0.005604 mol.

So that's accurate.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the activity coefficients or other factors, but I think that's beyond the scope of this problem.

Another possibility is that the initial assumption that [HPO4^2−] is 0.02802 M is incorrect because some of it has been converted to PO4^3−. But given that Ka3 is so small, this effect is minimal, so the difference should be negligible.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to only consider the first two dissociations, but I don't think that's the case because the question specifically asks about PO4^3−, which is the product of the third dissociation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the exact pH using more precise methods, such as the exact formula instead of Henderson-Hasselbalch, but I think H-H is an approximation that's good enough here.

Alternatively, perhaps the orthophosphate concentration is not just from the third dissociation but also from other sources, but I can't think of any other source here.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation of the ratio in the H-H equation.

Wait, the ratio in H-H is [base]/[acid], where base is HPO4^2−, acid is H2PO4^-.

So the ratio is 0.02802 /0.036745 ≈ 0.7628.

Hmm, perhaps I should compute this more accurately.

0.02802 /0.036745.

Let me compute that exactly.

0.02802 ÷0.036745.

Dividing 2802 by 3674.5.

Well, 3674.5 × 0.7628 = 2802, so that's correct.

So the log(0.7628) is approximately -0.1163.

So pH is 7.2076 -0.1163=7.0913.

So [H+]=8.11e-8 M.

Now, another thought: perhaps the total concentration of phosphate species is the sum of H2PO4^-, HPO4^2−, and PO4^3−. But given that PO4^3− is very small, perhaps the total is approximately 0.036745 +0.02802 =0.064765 M. But I don't think that affects the calculation of [PO4^3−].

Alternatively, perhaps the initial assumption that [HPO4^2−] is 0.02802 M is incorrect because some of it dissociates into PO4^3−. But since Ka3 is so small, the change would be negligible.

Wait, let me try to compute [HPO4^2−] more accurately, considering the dissociation into PO4^3−.

Let me denote [PO4^3−] as x.

Then, from the third dissociation:

Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3−]/[HPO4^2−].

[HPO4^2−] ≈0.02802 - x ≈0.02802 (since x is very small).

So,

x = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2−]) / [H+].

Which brings us back to the same calculation.

Thus, x ≈6.22e-7 M.

But the option A is 6.24e-7, which is very close. So perhaps the correct answer is option A.

Wait, but the options given don't have 6.22e-7, but option A is 6.24e-7. That's very close. Maybe I missed a decimal point somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the exact value without approximating early steps.

Another approach: compute everything with exact values using precise calculations.

Let me recompute:

[H+] = 8.11e-8 M.

Ka3 = 1.8e-12.

[HPO4^2−] initial = 0.02802 M.

So [PO4^3−] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02802) /8.11e-8.

Compute numerator:1.8e-12 *0.02802 =5.0436e-14.

Denominator:8.11e-8.

5.0436e-14 /8.11e-8 = (5.0436 /8.11) * 1e-6.

5.0436 ÷8.11 = approximately 0.6218.

So [PO4^3−] =0.6218e-6 →6.218e-7 M.

Which is approximately 6.22e-7 M.

Looking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7. So perhaps due to rounding during the calculation, the answer is option A.

But wait, another possibility: what if the actual concentration takes into account the exact pH and the exact [H+]?

Wait, perhaps I should compute [H+] more accurately.

pH =7.0908 → [H+] =10^(-7.0908) = ?

Using a calculator, 10^(-7.0908) is approximately 8.11e-8 M.

So, same as before.

Thus, the [PO4^3−] is approximately 6.22e-7 M, which is closest to option A (6.24e-7).

But wait, another thought: perhaps the problem expects me to calculate the concentration of HPO4^2− in the solution, considering that the solution is a buffer, and then find PO4^3− from that.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the buffer pH and the third dissociation.

Wait, here's another angle: the buffer pH affects the third dissociation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute [PO4^3−] using the exact expression, considering the buffer solution.

But I think the approach I've taken is correct.

So, the calculated [PO4^3−] is approximately 6.22e-7 M, which is very close to option A, 6.24e-7.

But wait, looking at the options again:

A) 6.24x10^-7

B)5.48x10^-7 

C)2.81x10^-7 

D)3.97x10^-7 

So, option A is the closest.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the ratio of [HPO4^2−] and [H2PO4^-].

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the problem is that the solution is a mixture of KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4, which could lead to some other equilibrium. For example, perhaps some of the H2PO4^- could react with HPO4^2−, but I don't think that's the case because they are conjugate acid and base.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the solution might have H3PO4, but given the pH is around 7, H3PO4 would be negligible.

Wait, another point: the problem states that the solution contains 1.00g of each salt. So the total volume is 200 cm³, so the concentrations of each ion are as we calculated.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects us to calculate the total concentration of phosphate species, but that's not what the question asks. The question is about orthophosphate, which is PO4^3−, the conjugate base of HPO4^2−.

Hmm.

But given all that, I think the correct answer is approximately 6.22e-7 M, which would correspond to option A (6.24e-7).

But wait, another possibility is that I miscalculated the pH.

Wait, perhaps I should redo the pH calculation more accurately.

The H-H equation:

pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2−]/[H2PO4^-])

pKa2 is 7.207.

Ratio is 0.02802 /0.036745 = 0.7628.

Log(0.7628) = -0.1163.

So pH =7.207 -0.1163=7.0907.

[H+] =10^-7.0907 =8.11e-8 M.

So no error there.

Thus, I think option A is the correct answer.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO₄³⁻) in the solution, we analyze the dissociation of the given salts and the equilibria involved.

### Step 1: Calculate moles and concentrations of the salts
- **KH₂PO₄**:  
  Mass = 1.00 g, Molar mass = 136.09 g/mol.  
  Moles = \( \frac{1.00}{136.09} \approx 0.007352 \, \text{mol} \).  
  Concentration in 200 cm³ (0.2 L):  
  \[ [\text{H}_2\text{PO}_4^-] = \frac{0.007352}{0.2} \approx 0.03676 \, \text{M}. \]

- **Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O**:  
  Mass = 1.00 g, Molar mass = 177.99 g/mol.  
  Moles = \( \frac{1.00}{177.99} \approx 0.005604 \, \text{mol} \).  
  Concentration in 200 cm³ (0.2 L):  
  \[ [\text{HPO}_4^{2-}] = \frac{0.005604}{0.2} \approx 0.02802 \, \text{M}. \]

### Step 2: Determine the pH of the buffer solution
The solution is a buffer involving H₂PO₄⁻ (acid) and HPO₄²⁻ (base). Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:  
\[
\text{pH} = \text{p}K_a + \log \left( \frac{[\text{base}]}{[\text{acid}]} \right),
\]
where \( K_a = 6.2 \times 10^{-8} \) (second dissociation of H₃PO₄), so:  
\[
\text{p}K_a = -\log(6.2 \times 10^{-8}) \approx 7.207.
\]
Substitute the concentrations:  
\[
\text{pH} = 7.207 + \log \left( \frac{0.02802}{0.03676} \right).
\]
The ratio \( \frac{0.02802}{0.03676} \approx 0.7628 \), and \( \log(0.7628) \approx -0.1163 \). Thus:  
\[
\text{pH} = 7.207 - 0.1163 = 7.0907.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate [PO₄³⁻] using the third dissociation
The third dissociation of HPO₄²⁻ is:  
\[
\text{HPO}_4^{2-} \leftrightharpoons \text{H}^+ + \text{PO}_4^{3-}.
\]
The equilibrium constant is \( K_a = 1.8 \times 10^{-12} \). Using the expression:  
\[
K_a = \frac{[\text{H}^+][\text{PO}_4^{3-}]}{[\text{HPO}_4^{2-}]}.
\]
Rearranging for \( [\text{PO}_4^{3-}] \):  
\[
[\text{PO}_4^{3-}] = \frac{K_a [\text{HPO}_4^{2-}]}{[\text{H}^+]}.
\]
From the pH, \( [\text{H}^+] = 10^{-\text{pH}} = 10^{-7.0907} \approx 8.11 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{M} \).  
Substitute \( K_a = 1.8 \times 10^{-12} \), \( [\text{HPO}_4^{2-}] = 0.02802 \, \text{M} \), and \( [\text{H}^+] = 8.11 \times 10^{-8} \):  
\[
[\text{PO}_4^{3-}] = \frac{(1.8 \times 10^{-12})(0.02802)}{8.11 \times 10^{-8}}.
\]
First, calculate the numerator:  
\[
(1.8 \times 10^{-12})(0.02802) = 5.0436 \times 10^{-14}.
\]
Then divide by \( 8.11 \times 10^{-8} \):  
\[
[\text{PO}_4^{3-}] = \frac{5.0436 \times 10^{-14}}{8.11 \times 10^{-8}} \approx 6.22 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}.
\]

### Step 4: Match the closest option
The calculated concentration of \( \text{PO}_4^{3-} \) is approximately \( 6.22 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \), which is closest to **Option A: \( 6.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \)**.
