Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it my best shot.

Alright, the problem is about finding the uncertainty in the P_z operator, ΔP_z, given that the system is in a specific state. The state is an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ. The state vector is given as a column vector: (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). 

First, I remember that the uncertainty in an operator is calculated using the formula ΔA = sqrt(⟨A²⟩ - ⟨A⟩²). So for P_z, I need to find ⟨P_z²⟩ and ⟨P_z⟩, then take the square root of their difference.

Wait, but wait. Since the state is given, I can compute the expectation values directly. Let me think about how to do that. The state is a column vector, so I can compute the expectation value of P_z by taking the conjugate transpose of the state vector, multiplying by P_z matrix, then multiplying by the state vector again.

But wait, the state is given without any mention of being normalized. Let me check if it's normalized. The components are (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). Let me square their magnitudes and add: (1/2)^2 + (1/sqrt(2))^2 + (1/2)^2. That would be 1/4 + 1/2 + 1/4. Adding those up: 1/4 is 0.25, so 0.25 + 0.5 = 0.75, plus 0.25 is 1. So yes, it's normalized. Good, so I don't need to worry about normalization factors.

So, to find ⟨P_z⟩, I compute ψ† P_z ψ.

Similarly, ⟨P_z²⟩ would be ψ† P_z² ψ. Then, the variance is ⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩², and the uncertainty is the square root of that.

Let me write down the matrices.

P_z matrix is given as:
First row: [ħ, 0, 0]
Second row: [0, 0, 0]
Third row: [0, 0, -ħ]

So P_z is a diagonal matrix. Therefore, it's easy to compute P_z squared. P_z squared is just each diagonal element squared. So P_z² would be diag( (ħ)^2, 0, ( -ħ )^2 ), which is diag( ħ², 0, ħ² ). So that's actually the same as P_z multiplied by itself, which is straightforward since P_z is diagonal.

Wait, but wait another second. Let me double-check that. Since P_z is diagonal, when you square it, each diagonal element is the square of the original. So yeah, P_z² is diag( ħ², 0, ħ² ), right.

Now, the state vector ψ is a column vector: [ -1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2 ]^T.

So let me compute ψ† P_z ψ first.

Since ψ is a column vector, ψ† is a row vector with complex conjugate entries. Looking at the given state, all the components are real numbers, so ψ† is just [ -1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2 ].

So ψ† P_z is [ (-1/2)*ħ, (1/sqrt(2))*0, (-1/2)*(-ħ) ].

Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, matrix multiplication. Let me compute it correctly.

Actually, when you compute ψ† P_z, you're doing a row vector multiplied by a matrix. Alternatively, since P_z is diagonal, each element in ψ is multiplied by the corresponding diagonal element.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it as the product of the transpose vector (row) and P_z, which is:

[ (-1/2) * ħ, (1/sqrt(2)) * 0, (-1/2) * (-ħ) ) ].

Wait no, that's not correct. Let me think. ψ is a column vector [a; b; c], so ψ† is [a*, b*, c*], a row vector. When you multiply ψ† by P_z, which is a diagonal matrix, you get a row vector where each element is ψ† multiplied by the diagonal elements of P_z. So:

ψ† P_z = [ a* * P_z(1,1), b* * P_z(2,2), c* * P_z(3,3) ]

Which, given the components of ψ and P_z:

a = -1/2 → a* = -1/2 (since real)
b = 1/sqrt(2) → b* = 1/sqrt(2)
c = -1/2 → c* = -1/2

P_z diagonal elements are [ħ, 0, -ħ].

So ψ† P_z = [ (-1/2)*ħ, (1/sqrt(2))*0, (-1/2)*(-ħ) ]

Which simplifies to [ -ħ/2, 0, ħ/2 ].

Then, when we multiply this row vector by ψ (the column vector), we get:

(-ħ/2) * (-1/2) + 0 * (1/sqrt(2)) + (ħ/2) * (-1/2 )

Let me compute each term:

First term: (-ħ/2) * (-1/2) = ħ/4

Second term: 0 * (1/sqrt(2)) = 0

Third term: (ħ/2) * (-1/2) = -ħ/4

So sum is ħ/4 + 0 - ħ/4 = 0.

So ⟨P_z⟩ is 0. That's interesting.

Now, let's compute ⟨P_z²⟩. So we need to compute ψ† P_z² ψ.

Again, P_z² is diag( ħ², 0, ħ² ).

So ψ† P_z² = [ (-1/2)*ħ², (1/sqrt(2))*0, (-1/2)* ħ² ]

Which is [ -ħ²/2, 0, -ħ²/2 ].

Then multiply by ψ:

[ (-ħ²/2) * (-1/2) ) + 0 * (1/sqrt(2)) + (-ħ²/2) * (-1/2) ]

Compute each term:

First term: (ħ²/2) * (1/2) = ħ²/4

Second term: 0

Third term: (ħ²/2) * (1/2) = ħ²/4

Adding them up: ħ²/4 + 0 + ħ²/4 = ħ²/2.

So ⟨P_z²⟩ is ħ²/2.

Now, the variance is ⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩² = (ħ²/2) - (0)^2 = ħ²/2.

The uncertainty ΔP_z is the square root of the variance, so sqrt( ħ²/2 ) = ħ / sqrt(2 ).

Wait, but wait. Are there any other factors I might have missed? For example, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the expectation values.

Let me double-check.

For ⟨P_z⟩, when I calculated ψ† P_z ψ, I got 0. Let me recheck that step.

ψ is [ -1/2; 1/sqrt(2); -1/2 ]

P_z is diag( ħ, 0, -ħ )

So ψ† P_z is [ (-1/2)*ħ, (1/sqrt(2))*0, (-1/2)*(-ħ) ] = [ -ħ/2, 0, ħ/2 ]

Then, when multiplied by ψ, which is [ -1/2; 1/sqrt(2); -1/2 ], we have:

(-ħ/2)*(-1/2) + 0*(1/sqrt(2)) + (ħ/2)*(-1/2 )

Which is (ħ/4) + 0 + (-ħ/4) = 0. Correct.

For ⟨P_z²⟩, since P_z is diagonal, P_z² is diag( ħ², 0, ħ² ).

So ψ† P_z² is [ (-1/2)*ħ², 0, (-1/2)*ħ² ].

Wait, wait. No. Wait, P_z² at (1,1) is ħ², (2,2) is 0, (3,3) is ħ².

So ψ† P_z² will be [ (-1/2)*ħ², (1/sqrt(2))*0, (-1/2)*ħ² ]

Which is [ -ħ²/2, 0, -ħ²/2 ]

Now, when this is multiplied by ψ, which is [ -1/2; 1/sqrt(2); -1/2 ]

So:

-ħ²/2 * (-1/2) → (ħ²/4 )

+ 0 * (1/sqrt(2)) → 0

+ (-ħ²/2) * (-1/2) → (ħ²/4 )

Adding them up: (ħ²/4) + (ħ²/4) = ħ²/2.

So that's correct. So ⟨P_z^2⟩ = ħ²/2.

So the variance is ħ²/2, and the square root is ħ / sqrt(2 ).

Looking at the options:

Option B is ħ/sqrt(2). So that's the answer.

Wait, but wait the options are:

A) sqrt(2)ħ

B) ħ/sqrt(2)

C) ħ/2

D) ħ

So the correct answer is B.

To determine the uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ of the operator $P_z$, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

### Step 1: Compute $\langle P_z \rangle$
The state vector is given as:

\[
\psi = \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{1}{2} \\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ -\frac{1}{2} \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The matrix for $P_z$ is:

\[
P_z = \begin{bmatrix} \hbar & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & -\hbar \end{bmatrix}.
\]

To compute $\langle P_z \rangle = \psi^\dagger P_z \psi$, we calculate:

\[
\psi^\dagger P_z = \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{1}{2} & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & -\frac{1}{2} \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} \hbar & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & -\hbar \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{\hbar}{2} & 0 & \frac{\hbar}{2} \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Now, multiply by $\psi$:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{\hbar}{2} & 0 & \frac{\hbar}{2} \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{1}{2} \\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ -\frac{1}{2} \end{bmatrix} = \left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right)\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right) + 0 + \left(\frac{\hbar}{2}\right)\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right) = \frac{\hbar}{4} - \frac{\hbar}{4} = 0.
\]

Thus, $\langle P_z \rangle = 0$.

### Step 2: Compute $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$
The matrix for $P_z^2$ is:

\[
P_z^2 = \begin{bmatrix} \hbar^2 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & \hbar^2 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

To compute $\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \psi^\dagger P_z^2 \psi$, we calculate:

\[
\psi^\dagger P_z^2 = \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{1}{2} & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & -\frac{1}{2} \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} \hbar^2 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & \hbar^2 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{\hbar^2}{2} & 0 & -\frac{\hbar^2}{2} \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Now, multiply by $\psi$:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{\hbar^2}{2} & 0 & -\frac{\hbar^2}{2} \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{1}{2} \\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ -\frac{1}{2} \end{bmatrix} = \left(-\frac{\hbar^2}{2}\right)\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right) + 0 + \left(-\frac{\hbar^2}{2}\right)\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right).
\]

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{\hbar^2}{4} + \frac{\hbar^2}{4} = \frac{\hbar^2}{2}.
\]

### Step 3: Compute $\Delta P_z$
The variance is:

\[
\text{Var}(P_z) = \langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2 = \frac{\hbar^2}{2} - 0^2 = \frac{\hbar^2}{2}.
\]

The uncertainty is:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\text{Var}(P_z)} = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar^2}{2}} = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ is $\frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}$, which corresponds to option **B**.

Answer: B
