Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric fields and conductors. Hmm, let me try to think through it step by step. I remember that conductors have some interesting properties when it comes to electric fields and charges. 

So the setup is this: there's an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R. Inside it, there's a small spherical cavity with radius r, and the center of this cavity is at a distance s from the center of the conductor. The radius of the cavity is smaller than R, which makes sense because it's inside. 

Then, a small positive charge +q is placed somewhere inside this cavity. The question asks about the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. The point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor, and its distance from the cavity's center is l. Oh, and l and L are both greater than R, so P is definitely outside the conductor. Also, the angle between l and s is theta.

I need to find the magnitude of the electric field E at point P. The options are given as A, B, C, D, each with a different formula involving these variables.

Let me recall what I know about conductors. When a conductor is neutral and you place a charge inside a cavity, the conductor's charges redistribute. Since the conductor was initially uncharged, the charges on the inner and outer surfaces will adjust.

Wait, right! For a conductor with a cavity containing a charge, the inner surface of the conductor will have an induced charge equal in magnitude but opposite in sign to the enclosed charge. So in this case, the charge +q inside the cavity would induce a -q on the inner surface of the conductor. But since the conductor itself is neutral overall, the outer surface must have a +q charge to balance it out.

Wait, no, wait. The conductor was uncharged initially. When a charge +q is placed inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor (the cavity's wall) will have an induced charge of -q. So the inner surface's charge is -q. Then, since the conductor as a whole was neutral, the outer surface must have +q to balance the inner -q (because the total charge of the conductor is zero, right? Because it was uncharged). Hmm, wait no. Wait, the conductor is neutral, meaning the total charge is zero. The inner surface has -q, so the outer surface must have +q for the total conductor to be zero (-q + outer charge = 0 → outer charge is +q). That makes sense.

But wait, when the conductor is isolated and neutral, adding a charge inside the cavity will induce charges on the inner and outer surfaces. So the inner surface has -q, the outer surface has +q, making the total conductor's charge zero.

But then, for points outside the conductor, the electric field should be as if the charge were at the center of the conductor. Because, from Gauss's Law, the field outside a spherical conductor depends only on the total enclosed charge. So the field outside would be the same as if all the charge were concentrated at the center.

Wait, but wait. The conductor's inner surface has -q, and the outer surface has +q. So the total charge outside is +q. But the point P is outside the conductor, so the electric field at P due to the conductor's charges would be due to the +q on the outer surface. But wait, the charge on the outer surface is distributed uniformly because the conductor is a sphere, right?

Wait, but the setup here is that the cavity is not at the center of the conductor. Oh, right! The cavity's center is separated by a distance s from the conductor's center. So the induced charges aren't symmetrically distributed in the same way as if the cavity were centered.

Hmm, wait a second. Oh, no, wait. I'm a bit confused. So the conductor is a sphere of radius R. The cavity is inside, but not at the center; it's off-center. The center of the cavity is a distance s from the conductor's center. So the induced charges on the inner surface of the conductor would arrange themselves to cancel the field inside the conductor's material. But since the cavity isn't at the center, would that affect the distribution?

Wait, no, because the inner surface of the conductor must have a charge distribution that exactly cancels the electric field inside the conductor (which is a conductor, so E inside is zero). The electric field inside the conductor is zero, but the field inside the cavity can be non-zero.

Wait, but wait. The field inside the conductor must be zero, so the induced charges on the inner surface will arrange themselves such that any external fields (like from the charge in the cavity) are canceled in the conducting material.

But in this case, the charge is in the cavity. So the inner surface will have an induced charge, but because the cavity is off-center, the inner charge distribution won't be symmetric—like, it will be more on one side than the other. So the inner surface's induced charge is -q, but its distribution is such that when combined with the charge inside the cavity, the field in the conductor is zero.

But for the purposes of the electric field outside the conductor, the outer surface's charge distribution is determined by the total charge of the conductor. Wait, the conductor was uncharged, so the outer surface has a charge +q? No, wait: the conductor was uncharged, and the inner surface has -q. So the outer surface must have +q to make the total charge of the conductor zero. Because the conductor's own charge is zero (uncharged), the inner surface is -q, so outer is +q. So the outer surface has +q.

But wait, the conductor's own charge is zero, so the sum of inner and outer charges is zero. So inner is -q, outer is +q. Therefore, the outer surface has a charge of +q, which is uniformly distributed because the conductor is spherical and the outer surface is symmetrical. Wait, but the outer surface is a sphere, right? Because the conductor is a sphere, so the outer surface is a sphere of radius R. So any charges on the outer surface would distribute themselves uniformly, regardless of what's happening inside.

Wait, but wait. The induced charge on the inner surface is because of the charge in the cavity. The outer surface's charge is due to the fact that the conductor must remain neutral. So the outer surface has +q, uniformly distributed.

But then, for a point outside the conductor (like point P), the electric field should be the same as that produced by a point charge +q at the center of the conductor. Because the outer surface's charge is +q, and it's symmetric, so the field outside is as if all the charge is at the center. So the field at P would be as if the +q were located at the center of the conductor.

But wait, the point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor. So the field E would be (1/(4πε₀)) * (q / L²). Because for a point charge, the electric field is E = k q / r², where r is the distance from the charge. So in this case, r is L, the distance from P to the center of the conductor.

But wait, the options have various expressions. Let me look.

Option B is (1/(4πε₀)) * (q / L²). That's what I just thought. Option A has (l - s cosθ) squared. Option C is (l + s cosθ) squared. Option D is q/(l^2).

Wait, but why is there an option with l and s and theta? Because in the setup, l is the distance from P to the cavity's center, which is at a distance s from the conductor's center. So if the point P is at a position relative to both the conductor's center and the cavity's center, perhaps the effective position of the charge matters.

Wait, but wait. I thought that the field outside is only due to the outer charge, which is uniformly distributed. So regardless of where the cavity is, the field outside depends only on the total charge on the outer surface. So the position of the point P relative to the cavity's center might not matter. Because the outer surface's charge acts as if all the charge is at the center of the conductor.

Unless I'm missing something. Let me think again.

The conductor's outer surface has a charge of +q. So the field outside is the same as if a point charge +q were at the center of the conductor. So regardless of where the cavity is, the outer conductor's field at P is just E = k q / L². So that would make option B the correct one.

Wait, but the charge in the cavity is +q, which induces -q on the inner surface. So does the field inside the conductor (which is zero) influence the field outside? I don't think so because the conductor's material ensures that the field inside is zero, and the outer field is only due to the outer charge.

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the cavity's charge doesn't affect the field outside. Because, from the outside, the only charge that contributes is the outer +q.

Wait, but wait. Suppose the cavity is not at the center, so the inner surface has a non-uniform distribution of -q. But the outer surface's distribution is still uniform because it's a conductor. So the field outside is as if the +q were at the center.

Therefore, the field at point P is only due to the +q charge, as if it were at the center of the conductor. So the distance from P to the center is L, so E = (1/(4πε₀)) * q/(L²). So the correct option is B.

Wait, but why do the other options involve l, s, and theta? Maybe if the charge were on the inner surface, but no, it's inside the cavity. Or if the conductor were not a sphere, but it is.

So I think option B is correct.

To determine the electric field $\vec{E}$ at a point $P$ outside the spherical conductor, we analyze the situation as follows:

1. **Setup and Induced Charges**:  
   The spherical conductor of radius $R$ is initially uncharged. A small spherical cavity of radius $r$ is present inside the conductor, and its center is separated by a distance $s$ from the center of the conductor. A charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity. This induces a charge of $-q$ on the inner surface of the conductor (to cancel the electric field within the conductor's material) and a charge of $+q$ on the outer surface of the conductor (to ensure the conductor remains neutral overall).

2. **Electric Field Outside the Conductor**:  
   For points outside the conductor, the electric field depends only on the total charge on the outer surface of the conductor. Since the outer surface has a charge of $+q$ and the conductor is spherical, the charge distributes uniformly on the outer surface. Thus, the electric field at any point outside the conductor is equivalent to the field produced by a point charge $+q$ located at the center of the conductor.

3. **Distance and Electric Field**:  
   The point $P$ is located at a distance $L$ from the center of the conductor. Using Coulomb's law, the electric field at $P$ is given by:
   \[
   E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}.
   \]

4. **Relevance of Other Variables**:  
   The variables $l$, $s$, and $\theta$ describe the geometry of the cavity and its center relative to the conductor and point $P$. However, since the outer surface charge is uniformly distributed, the electric field outside the conductor depends only on the total charge $+q$ and the distance $L$ from the center of the conductor. The position of the cavity or the charge inside it does not affect the field outside the conductor.

5. **Correct Option**:  
   Among the given options, only **Option B** correctly represents the electric field at point $P$.
