Okay, so I've got this astronomy question about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, let me think through what I know.

So the question says that there are two stars with the same mass as the Sun, and each has a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. The planets are in circular orbits. The detection method is the radial velocity (RV) method. 

In the RV method, the idea is that as a planet orbits a star, the star moves a bit in the opposite direction because of the planet's gravity. This causes a Doppler shift in the star's spectral lines. The shift tells us about the planet's presence and some properties.

The question gives two planets. Planet #1 causes a spectral line shift of 5 milliangstroms periodic, and Planet #2 causes a 7 milliangstrom shift. They're both detected using the RV method.

Wait, I'm trying to remember. The RV method measures the velocity of the star towards and away from us. The formula I think is something like the star's velocity (v) is related to the planet's mass and orbital period. Oh right, the formula is v = (2π G)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) ), but M_p is much smaller than M_star, so M_p + M_star ≈ M_star, which is the mass of the star. Since both stars have the same mass as the Sun, M_star is same for both.

But wait, the actual formula simplifies because the planet mass is small compared to the star. So v ≈ ( (G * M_p) / (M_star^2) )^(1/3) * (2π / P) )^(1/3) )? Or wait, maybe I should think in terms of the RV amplitude. The RV semi-amplitude K is given by K = (v) = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2) ) )^(1/3) ) * (2π / P ) )^(1/3) ). Hmm, perhaps a better approach is to remember that the RV amplitude K is proportional to (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3)) * (1/P^(1/3)) ), but I'm a bit shaky.

Wait, another approach: the RV method gives the velocity semi-amplitude K. The formula for K is: K = ( (27 * pi * G) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) * (P)^( -1/3 ) ). But since M_p << M_star, M_star + M_p ≈ M_star, so K ≈ ( (27 pi G )^(1/3) ) * (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3) ) * (P)^( -1/3 )

Wait, but wait, another version I've seen is K = ( (v) ) = ( (2π G )^(1/3) ) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) ) * (1 / P^(1/3) ) )

But perhaps a more practical approach is to consider that the RV semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_p) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) * P^(1/3) ) ), assuming sin i is 1 (edge-on orbit, which is a good assumption here since we can detect the planet).

So K1 and K2 are the velocities for planet 1 and 2. Given that both planets have the same mass (similar to Neptune), and the stars have same mass, the only variable is P, the orbital period.

Wait, but the problem says the shift in the spectral line is periodic with a certain amplitude. So the amplitude K is given as 5 and 7 milliangstroms for planet #1 and #2, respectively.

Wait, but wait. The actual velocity K is measured in m/s, not in angstroms. Oh, but I remember that 1 m/s corresponds to a wavelength shift of about 0.001 angstroms (since the speed of light c is ~3e5 km/s, and the Doppler shift formula delta lambda/lambda = v/c. For the Sun's spectral lines, let's say lambda is about 500 nm (5000 Angstroms) so 5000 A. Then delta lambda is (v/c) * lambda.

So v = (delta lambda) * c / lambda.

So, converting delta lambda in miliangstroms to velocity:

delta_lambda (A) = K * (lambda) / c.

Wait, no, the formula is delta_lambda / lambda = v / c

So, v = c * (delta_lambda / lambda)

But delta_lambda here is the shift, say 5 milliangstroms is 5e-3 A.

Wait, but the star's spectral lines are at a certain wavelength, say lambda. So the shift is delta_lambda.

So K (in m/s) is K = (delta_lambda (in A) ) * c / lambda (in A) )

But what is lambda? Let's say the star emits at about 500 nm (5000 A). So:

K = (delta_lambda) * (3e5 km/s) / 5000 A.

Wait, but let's compute this.

3e5 km/s is 3e8 m/s. Wait, no, 3e5 km/s is 3e5 * 1e3 m/s = 3e8 m/s. Wait no, 3e5 km/s is 3e5 * 1e3 m/s = 3e8 m/s? Wait, no. Wait, 1 km is 1e3 m, 1 s is 1 s. So 1 km/s is 1e3 m/s. So 3e5 km/s is 3e5 * 1e3 m/s = 3e8 m/s? Oh wait, no, 3e5 km/s is 3e5 *1e3 m/s = 3e8 m/s. Because 1 km = 1e3 m, so 3e5 km/s = 3e5 *1e3 m/s = 3e8 m/s. So the speed of light is approximately 3e8 m/s.

So, the formula:

v (m/s) = (delta_lambda (A) ) * (3e8 m/s) / (lambda (A)) )

But delta_lambda is in milliangstroms, so 5 miliangstrom is 5e-3 A.

So, for Planet #1:

K1 = (5e-3 A) * (3e8 m/s) / lambda.

Similarly for Planet #2: K2 = (7e-3 A) * (3e8 m/s) / lambda.

But since the emission line is the same for both stars, lambda is the same. So K is proportional to delta_lambda.

So K1/K2 = 5/7. Wait, but wait.

Wait, but from earlier, K is proportional to (M_p) / (M_star^(2/3) * P^(1/3) )

Since M_p and M_star are same for both, K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3).

So K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3) )

Wait, let me clarify. Because K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), so higher K means shorter period.

So, K1 = 5, K2 =7.

So K1/K2 = 5/7.

But since K1 = (constant) / P1^(1/3), K2 = (constant) / P2^(1/3).

So K1 / K2 = [ (1 / P1^(1/3) ) ] / [ (1 / P2^(1/3) ) ] = (P2 / P1 )^(1/3 )

So (5/7) = (P2/P1)^(1/3 )

So (5/7)^3 = P2/P1

Which is (125)/(343) = P2/P1.

So P2 = (125/343) P1.

Wait, that can't be right because 125/343 is about 0.364.

Wait, wait, no. Let's think again.

K is proportional to (1/P^(1/3)). So K1 = C / P1^(1/3), K2 = C / P2^(1/3), where C is the same for both.

Therefore, K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3).

So (5/7) = (P2/P1)^(1/3).

Cubing both sides:

(5/7)^3 = P2/P1.

Which is 125/343 ≈ 0.364.

So P2 is about 0.364 times P1. So the period of planet 2 is about 0.36 times that of planet 1. So the question is, how many times longer is planet 2's period than planet 1's?

Wait, the question is "How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?" So P2 / P1 = 0.364. So P2 is shorter than P1 by a factor of ~0.364. So P2 is about 0.36 times P1. So P2 is shorter, so it's not longer. Wait, but the options are: A is ~0.36, which would mean P2 is 0.36 times P1, so shorter. But the question is how many times longer, so if P2 is shorter, then it's 1/0.364 ≈ 2.75 times shorter. So planet #2 has a shorter period than planet #1.

Wait, but the question is "how many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?" So it's asking for P2/P1. So if P2 is 0.36 P1, then the period of planet 2 is 0.36 times longer than that of planet 1. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. If I have, say, P1=10 days and P2=3.6 days, then P2 is about 0.36 times P1. So it's shorter. So the period of planet 2 is shorter than planet 1. So the question is how many times longer is P2 than P1. So the answer would be 0.36 times as long, which is option A: ~0.36.

So the answer is A) ~0.36.

Wait, but let me think again. Because the RV method measures the velocity of the star. The velocity semi-amplitude is K = (v) = ( (G * M_p ) / ( (M_star + M_p )^2 ) )^(1/3) * (2 pi / P )^(1/3) ) / (c * sin i )

But in this problem, since the mass of the planet is similar for both, and the stars have same mass, and sin i is same (since both are detected, assuming edge-on), then K is proportional to (1/P^(1/3)).

So higher K means shorter period. So Planet #2 has a higher K (7 milliA vs 5), so its period is shorter than Planet #1. 

So the ratio of periods is (K1/K2)^3 = (5/7)^3 = 125/343 ≈ 0.364. So P2 = 0.364 * P1. So P2 is ~0.36 times the period of P1.

So the question is how many times longer is P2 than P1. So P2 is 0.36 times as long as P1. So the answer is 0.36 times, which is option A.

The radial velocity (RV) method detects exoplanets by measuring the Doppler shift in the spectral lines of the host star. The RV semi-amplitude \( K \) is proportional to \( \frac{1}{P^{1/3}} \), where \( P \) is the orbital period of the planet. This relationship arises because \( K \) depends on the star's velocity, which is influenced by the planet's mass, orbital period, and the star's mass.

For Planet #1 and Planet #2, the RV shifts are given as 5 milliangstroms and 7 milliangstroms, respectively. Since the stars have the same mass and the planets have similar masses, the ratio of the RV semi-amplitudes directly reflects the ratio of the inverse cube roots of their orbital periods:

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \frac{P_2^{1/3}}{P_1^{1/3}}
\]

Substituting \( K_1 = 5 \) and \( K_2 = 7 \):

\[
\frac{5}{7} = \frac{P_2^{1/3}}{P_1^{1/3}}
\]

Cubing both sides:

\[
\left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3 = \frac{P_2}{P_1}
\]

\[
\frac{125}{343} \approx 0.364
\]

Thus, \( P_2 \approx 0.364 P_1 \), meaning the orbital period of Planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of Planet #1. Therefore, Planet #2's orbital period is **shorter** than Planet #1's by a factor of ~0.36. Since the question asks how many times longer Planet #2's period is compared to Planet #1's, the answer is approximately 0.36.
