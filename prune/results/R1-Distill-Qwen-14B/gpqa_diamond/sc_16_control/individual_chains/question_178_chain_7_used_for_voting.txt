Okay, so I've got this Lagrangian question to tackle. Hmm, let's see. The Lagrangian given is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{mu nu} ψ F^{mu nu}. And σ_{mu nu} is defined as (i/2)[γ_mu, γ_nu]. The question is about the mass dimension of κ and whether the theory is renormalizable. The options are A to D.

First, I need to remember how to find the mass dimension of the coupling constant in a Lagrangian. I think the general approach is to ensure that the Lagrangian has mass dimension 4 because the action is dimensionless, and the integral over four dimensions requires the integrand (the Lagrangian) to have dimension 4.

So each term in the Lagrangian must have dimension 4. Let's break down the term κ ψ̄ σ_{mu nu} ψ F^{mu nu}.

First, I should figure out the dimensions of each field and the coupling. Let's recall the standard dimensions in four spacetime dimensions. The fields typically have certain dimensions based on their type.

F^{mu nu} is the field strength tensor for a gauge field, like electromagnetism. The gauge field A_mu has mass dimension 1, so F^{mu nu}, which is ∂_mu A_nu - ∂_nu A_mu, also has dimension 2 because each derivative is dimension 1 and A has dimension 1. So F is dimension 2.

Now the spinor fields, ψ. In four dimensions, a Dirac spinor ψ has mass dimension 3/2. Because the Dirac equation is (i gamma^mu D_mu - m)ψ = 0, and the derivative D has dimension 1, m has dimension 1, so ψ must have dimension 3/2 to balance the equation.

So ψ̄ (which is ψ† gamma^0) also has dimension 3/2.

Now σ_{mu nu} is a term involving the gamma matrices and their commutators. Since σ_{mu nu} is built from the gamma matrices, which are dimensionless (as they are part of the basis, not fields), its dimension comes from the structure. Let me think about σ_{mu nu}: it's (i/2)[gamma_mu, gamma_nu], which is a symmetric tensor. So when you have ψ̄ σ_{mu nu} ψ, that's like a product of three spinor terms, but σ is a product of gamma matrices so it's also dimensionless.

Wait, no, σ_{mu nu} is a Lorentz tensor, but in terms of mass dimension, since it's made from gamma matrices which are dimensionless, σ's dimension is 0.

So now, looking at the term κ ψ̄ σ_{mu nu} ψ F^{mu nu}, each component's dimension is:

κ: which is the coupling, we need to find its dimension.

ψ̄: 3/2, ψ:3/2, σ:0, F:2.

So putting it all together:

The term is κ * (3/2) * (3/2) * (0) [from σ] * (2) ?

Wait, no. Because ψ̄ σ ψ is (3/2) + (3/2) = 3, because each ψ is 3/2, and σ is 0, so the entire part ψ̄ σ ψ would have dimension 3. Then F^{mu nu} is 2. So the product is 3 * 2 =5. The entire term has dimension [κ] +5 must equal 4, because the Lagrangian term must have dimension 4.

So [κ] +5 =4 → [κ] = -1.

So the mass dimension of κ is -1. That narrows it down to options A or C.

Next, is the theory renormalizable? Renormalizability depends on the dimension of the coupling constant. For a term to be renormalizable, the mass dimension of the coupling must be ≥ 0. Wait, wait, because in general, if the coupling has dimension d, then in terms of perturbation theory, each vertex brings in a factor of the coupling, and the superficial degree of divergence can be found via certain formulas.

Wait, another approach: in four dimensions, a renormalizable interaction must have a coupling with mass dimension ≥0. Because higher dimensions (negative) would mean the coupling becomes relevant, leading to non-renormalizable interactions that require a higher number of derivatives or something, making them non-renormalizable.

Wait, no, wait. The standard rule is that the coupling constant must have a mass dimension ≤ (4 - n), where n is the number of fields in the interaction term. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing up. Alternatively, for a term in the Lagrangian of the form g φ^m, the dimension of g is 4 - (d φ * (m)).

In our case, the interaction term is κ ψ̄ σ F ψ. Let me count the fields: it's two ψ's, one F. So each ψ has dimension 3/2, F has dimension 2. So the product is (3/2 +3/2 +2) = 3+2=5. So the term is κ multiplied by (5). So the dimension of the term is [κ] +5 =4. As before, [κ] is -1.

Wait, but for renormalizability, each term must have a coupling with positive or zero dimension. Because if the coupling has a negative mass dimension, that implies that the interaction is relevant (in the Wilsonian sense), which would require an infinite number of terms to be considered for renormalization. Wait, no, I think I got that reversed. Wait, no, actually, in four dimensions, couplings with negative mass dimensions are non-renormalizable because they have more fields than allowed by the renormalizability condition. Wait, no: the renormalizability depends on the superficial degree of divergence. A term is non-renormalizable if its superficial degree of divergence is positive, which usually happens when the coupling has a negative mass dimension.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the superficial degree of divergence. The formula is D = 4L - (sum of dimensions of fields in the vertex). For a Feynman diagram, each vertex contributes based on the interaction term.

In this case, each interaction vertex from the term L_int has the fields ψ, ψ, F (since the term is κ ψ̄ σ ψ F). So each vertex has three fields: two ψs and one F.

Wait, no: the term is ψ̄ σ ψ F. So each vertex has two ψs, one F, and the coupling κ. So the number of fields per vertex is 2 +1=3.

Wait, no, the term is ψ̄ (which is one field) multiplied by ψ (another field) multiplied by F (third field). So each vertex has three fields: ψ, ψ, F.

The superficial degree of divergence formula for a diagram is D = 4 - (sum of dimensions of the fields in the vertex)*number_of_vertices + (other terms for loops etc.)? Or perhaps I should use the general formula for the superficial degree of divergence, which is D = 4L - (sum over lines of internal lines) * ... No, I think the standard formula for a Feynman diagram is D = 4 - (sum of the dimensions of all the fields in the interaction term) * V, where V is the number of vertices.

Wait, no, the correct formula is D = 4 - (sum of dimensions of each field in each vertex) * V. So each vertex contributes the sum of the dimensions of the fields it has.

In this case, each vertex has ψ̄ (3/2), ψ (3/2), and F (2). So sum per vertex: 3/2 +3/2 +2 = 3 +2 =5. So each vertex contributes 5. So for V vertices, the sum would be 5V.

Thus, D =4 -5V.

Wait, but that can’t be right. Because for V=1, D=4-5= -1. Which is negative. So the superficial degree of divergence is negative, meaning that the diagram is superficially convergent. So the theory is superrenormalizable?

Wait, but wait, if D is negative, the integral converges, no divergences. So all loops would be convergent, meaning the theory is superrenormalizable. But wait, that seems contradictory to some intuition I have. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I got the formula wrong. The correct formula for the superficial degree of divergence is D = 4L - (sum over all lines of their momentum factors) + (sum over vertices of their field dimensions) ?

Alternatively, another approach is to consider that each vertex, in the Feynman diagram, contributes a certain number of derivatives or factors, but perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, another way: for each vertex, the number of momenta in the Feynman integral. For a term in the Lagrangian like L ~ g φ^k, each vertex would contribute a factor that brings in k fields, each with a momentum, and the integral would be over d^4k. So the superficial degree of divergence is D = 4 - (sum of the fields' dimensions at each vertex) * V.

Wait, wait, for a term like L = g φ^3, each vertex has three φ fields. The dimension of each φ is (3 -d)/2, where d is the spacetime dimension (so in 4 it's (3)/2). So for each vertex, the sum is 3 * (3/2) =9/2. Then D=4 - (9/2) * V.

Wait, perhaps no, another formula: I've read before that the superficial degree of divergence is D = d - (sum of the external legs' dimensions) + (sum for each vertex of (d - (sum of field dimensions at the vertex)) ) * loops or something. Wait, perhaps it's better to think of it in terms of the power counting.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula D = d - (sum over vertices of (d - (sum of dimensions of fields at that vertex)) )) * V.

In four dimensions, d=4.

At each vertex, the sum of the dimensions is 3/2 (ψ̄) + 3/2 (ψ) + 2 (F) =3/2 +3/2 =3; 3 +2=5.

So, for each vertex, (d - sum) is 4 -5 = -1.

So D=4 - ( -1 ) * V. Because each vertex contributes a term (d - sum) which is -1.

Wait, wait, perhaps the formula is D = d - (sum for each vertex of (d - (sum of fields at vertex))) * V. So per vertex, it's (4 -5)= -1. So D=4 - (-1)*V → D=4 + V.

But that would mean for V=1, D=5, which is positive, leading to superficially divergent diagrams. But that can't be right because if the coupling has dimension -1, the term is dimension 4. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I should think about the superficial degree of divergence in terms of the number of loops. The formula for D is D = 4L - (sum of the dimensions of the fields) at each vertex * V.

Wait, each loop gives 4 dimensions (from the integral d^4k). Each propagator contributes a certain amount, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, another approach: the superficial degree of divergence is given by:

D = 4 - (sum over vertices of (number of fields per vertex * their dimensions)).

Wait no, perhaps I should look it up in my notes.

Wait, maybe another approach: Each field in the interaction term contributes a dimension, and each vertex brings in a factor. The superficial degree of divergence is D = 4 - (sum of the dimensions of each field in the vertex) * (number of vertices).

In our case, each vertex has 3 fields: two ψs and one F.

Each ψ has dimension 3/2, F has dimension 2. So each vertex contributes 3/2 +3/2 +2=3+2=5. So sum per vertex is 5.

So D =4 - 5V.

Now, for a diagram with V vertices, L loops, the superficial degree of divergence is D=4 -5V.

Wait, but in any diagram, the number of loops L is related to the number of vertices V and the number of propagators, but perhaps for power counting, we can ignore that and just consider D.

But for a renormalizable theory, we need D ≤0 for all diagrams. Because if D>0, the diagram is superficially divergent, which requires renormalization.

So in our case, D=4-5V. So for V=1, D= -1, which is negative, so the diagram is convergent. For V=0 (tree level), D=4, which is positive, but tree-level diagrams don't cause divergence because they don't have loops. Wait, but tree-level Feynman diagrams don't have loops, so their superficial degree of divergence isn't relevant for loop integrals, which are where divergences occur.

Wait, but for loop diagrams, V is at least 1. So D=4-5V. Let's see for V=1, D= -1, which is convergent. For V=2, D=4-10= -6. Still convergent. So all loop diagrams would have D negative, meaning the theory is superrenormalizable.

Wait, but superrenormalizable theories have only a finite number of divergences, and are thus renormalizable. So if the theory is superrenormalizable, it's automatically renormalizable. But wait, I thought that for a theory to be renormalizable, the coupling constants must have non-negative mass dimensions. Because in four dimensions, renormalizable theories have couplings with positive mass dimension, right? Or maybe it's the other way around.

Wait, mass dimension of the coupling. In four dimensions, the coupling g in a renormalizable interaction term must have dimension ≥0. Because if g has dimension d, then for the term g φ^n to have dimension 4 (as Lagrangian must be dimension 4), we have d + n*(dimension of φ) =4.

So for φ^4 theory, each φ has dimension 1. So d + 4*1=4 → d=0. So the coupling is dimensionless, which is renormalizable.

For a φ^3 theory, 3*(1) + d=4 → d=1. So the coupling has positive dimension, so term is renormalizable.

But in our case, the coupling κ has dimension -1. So the term is dimension 4: [κ] + [ψ̄ σ ψ F] = (-1) +5=4.

Now, in terms of renormalizability, if the coupling has negative dimension, the term is non-renormalizable. Because each vertex brings in a factor of κ, which has dimension -1. So each vertex contributes a factor that scales as (momentum)^-1. So higher momentum scales would make the coupling weaker, meaning the interaction is irrelevant in the RG sense.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

The renormalizability condition in four dimensions is that the coupling must have a mass dimension ≥0. Because in the counterterms, you can only have terms with the same or higher dimensions. If the coupling has negative dimension, you can't form finite counterterms, leading to the theory being non-renormalizable.

So our coupling κ has mass dimension -1, which is negative. Therefore, the theory is non-renormalizable.

Wait, but earlier I thought the superficial degree of divergence is negative, implying the theory is superrenormalizable. But that's conflicting. What's correct?

Wait, perhaps I confused the superficial degree of divergence. Let me clarify: The superficial degree of divergence is a way to determine whether a Feynman diagram is divergent. If D>0, the diagram diverges superficially. If D≤0, it's convergent.

In our case, for each loop, D=4-5V. For V=1, D=4-5= -1, which is convergent. So all loop diagrams are convergent. That suggests that the theory is superrenormalizable, because all loop integrals are convergent, meaning there's only a finite number of possible divergences, perhaps even none.

Wait, but superrenormalizable theories do have only finite counterterms, but the condition for being renormalizable is that the theory can absorb all possible divergences into a finite number of counterterms.

So our theory, with all loop diagrams convergent, would be superrenormalizable and thus renormalizable.

Wait, but wait, that can't be right because the coupling has negative dimension. Because in four dimensions, a term like κ ψ̄ σ F ψ has a coupling κ with dimension -1. So each vertex brings in a factor of (momentum)^-1, right?

Wait, perhaps I should think about the scaling. If I change the energy scale by a factor of μ, how do the terms scale?

The Lagrangian must be invariant under scaling. So each term's dimension must be 4. The fields and coupling scale accordingly.

For a coupling with dimension d, when you change the scale by a factor λ, the coupling scales as λ^d.

So if κ has dimension -1, then under scaling, κ → λ^{-1} κ.

So, when you go to higher energies (large λ), the coupling becomes weaker, which is an irrelevant interaction. Wait, no, wait: if the coupling has dimension d, and d>0, the coupling grows with energy, making it relevant. If d<0, the coupling decreases with energy, making it irrelevant.

But wait, irrelevant operators are usually forbidden in renormalizable theories because they are nonrenormalizable.

So, in our case, since the coupling is irrelevant, the term is non-renormalizable. Because you can't have a renormalizable theory with an irrelevant coupling in four dimensions.

So, this would suggest the theory is non-renormalizable.

But this contradicts the earlier finding that all loop integrals are convergent.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the superficial degree of divergence. Let me re-examine that.

Earlier, I thought that the superficial degree of divergence is D=4 -5V. For V=1, D= -1, which is convergent. But perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Let me recall the correct formula for superficial degree of divergence. It's given by:

D = d - (sum of the dimensions of all fields in the interaction term) * V + (sum of the dimensions of the external legs) )

Wait, no. Let me look it up in my memory. The standard formula is:

In d dimensions, the superficial degree of divergence D is given by:

D = d - (sum over vertices of (sum of field dimensions at each vertex)) ) + (number of loops) * something.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to use the formula:

For a Feynman diagram with V vertices, I internal lines, and L loops, the superficial degree of divergence is:

D = d - (sum of all fields at vertices) ) + (I) * (something).

Hmm, maybe I should think about each line contributing a momentum integral. Each loop contributes 4 dimensions (from the integral). Each propagator contributes a certain number, but perhaps that's complicating things.

Alternatively, I can use the formula:

D = d - (sum for each vertex of (sum of dimensions of fields at that vertex)) ) * V + 2I,

where I is the number of internal lines.

Wait, that may not be correct. Alternatively, another formula is D = d - (sum over vertices of (d - (sum of field dimensions at the vertex))) ) * V.

Wait, another approach: Each vertex contributes a certain number of derivatives, but perhaps that's not the right way.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think about the superficial degree of divergence as:

D = 4L - (sum over all lines of their momentum factors) )

Wait, perhaps that's not correct either.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should look for a different approach. Let's try to count the number of loops and see.

Wait, perhaps the key point is that the presence of a coupling with negative mass dimension means that the interaction is non-renormalizable. Because in the counterterms, you can't have terms with higher powers than what's already in the Lagrangian. Since the coupling is dimension -1, any counterterm would have to have higher dimension, which is impossible, leading to the theory not being renormalizable.

So, the conclusion is that κ has dimension -1, and the theory is non-renormalizable. So the correct option is C.

Wait, but earlier I thought that with D negative, the diagrams are convergent, which suggests it's superrenormalizable. So which is correct?

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up renormalizability through superficial degree of divergence and the coupling's dimension.

Wait, I think I should rely on the coupling's dimension. In four dimensions, a renormalizable theory requires that the coupling has mass dimension ≥0. Because:

The general term in the Lagrangian is something like L ~ g φ^k. The dimension of the Lagrangian must be 4. So [g] + k [φ] =4.

In four dimensions, [φ] for a scalar is (4-2)/2 =1. For a Dirac spinor, [ψ] = (4-1)/2 = 3/2. 

In our case, the term is κ ψ̄ σ F ψ. The fields are two ψs and one F. So [ψ̄] =3/2, [ψ]=3/2, [F]=2. So the product [ψ̄ σ ψ F] is 3/2 +3/2 +2 =5. Wait, no, because σ is a product of gamma matrices, which are dimensionless, so [σ_{mu nu} ]= [γ_mu, γ_nu]/2i, so dimensionless. So [ψ̄ σ ψ] = [ψ̄][ψ] = (3/2)+(3/2) =3. Then [F] is 2. So the product [ψ̄ σ ψ F] is 3+2=5.

So the term is κ * [5] =4 → [κ] = -1.

But in four dimensions, for a term to be renormalizable, [κ] must be ≥0. Since here [κ]=-1, the term is non-renormalizable. So the theory is not renormalizable.

So the correct answer is option C: [κ]=-1, theory is not renormalizable.

Wait, but earlier when I computed D=4-5V, and for V=1, D=-1, which is convergent. So the theory would be superrenormalizable. But superrenormalizable theories are a subset of renormalizable theories, right? Or are they separate?

Wait, actually, superrenormalizable theories are those where the superficial degree of divergence is negative, leading to only a finite number of divergent diagrams, making them easier to renormalize. But the key point is whether the coupling has a positive dimension or not.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. The correct criteria for renormalizability is that the coupling must have a non-negative mass dimension. Because if the coupling has a negative dimension, it's non-renormalizable, regardless of the superficial degree of divergence.

Wait, but wait: some sources say that a theory is renormalizable if all divergent Green's functions can be absorbed by a finite number of counterterms. But the superficial degree of divergence being negative (as in our case) would mean all diagrams are convergent, implying no loop divergences. So the theory is superrenormalizable. But that would mean it's also renormalizable because it doesn't require any renormalization beyond perhaps the tree level. But I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should separate the two concepts: whether a term is renormalizable depends on the dimension of the coupling. If the coupling is non-renormalizable (negative dimension), the term is non-renormalizable, regardless of other factors.

In our case, since κ has dimension -1, the term is non-renormalizable. So the correct answer is option C.

So the final conclusion: [κ]=-1, theory is not renormalizable. So option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the mass dimension of the coupling constant $\kappa$ and whether the theory is renormalizable, we analyze the given Lagrangian:

\[
\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}} = \kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu},
\]
where $\sigma_{\mu\nu} = \frac{i}{2} [\gamma_\mu, \gamma_\nu]$. 

### Step 1: Mass Dimensions of Fields
In four spacetime dimensions:
- The Dirac spinor $\psi$ has mass dimension $[\psi] = \frac{3}{2}$.
- The field strength tensor $F^{\mu\nu}$ (e.g., for a gauge field) has mass dimension $[F^{\mu\nu}] = 2$.
- The $\sigma_{\mu\nu}$ term is constructed from commutators of dimensionless gamma matrices, so $[\sigma_{\mu\nu}] = 0$.

### Step 2: Mass Dimension of $\kappa$
The Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4 to ensure the action is dimensionless. Breaking down the term $\kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu}$:
- $[\bar{\psi}] = \frac{3}{2}$.
- $[\psi] = \frac{3}{2}$.
- $[\sigma_{\mu\nu}] = 0$.
- $[F^{\mu\nu}] = 2$.

The total dimension of the term is:
\[
[\kappa] + [\bar{\psi}] + [\psi] + [\sigma_{\mu\nu}] + [F^{\mu\nu}] = [\kappa] + \frac{3}{2} + \frac{3}{2} + 0 + 2 = [\kappa] + 5.
\]
Since the Lagrangian must have dimension 4:
\[
[\kappa] + 5 = 4 \implies [\kappa] = -1.
\]

### Step 3: Renormalizability
In four dimensions, a theory is renormalizable if the mass dimension of the coupling constant satisfies $[\kappa] \geq 0$. Here, $[\kappa] = -1$, which is negative. This implies that the interaction term is **non-renormalizable**. Non-renormalizable theories require an infinite number of counterterms to absorb divergences, making them not predictive at high energy scales.

### Step 4: Superficial Degree of Divergence (Optional Check)
The superficial degree of divergence $D$ for a Feynman diagram is given by:
\[
D = 4 - \sum_{\text{vertices}} (\text{sum of field dimensions at each vertex}).
\]
For this interaction term, each vertex involves two $\psi$ fields and one $F^{\mu\nu}$ field, with total dimension:
\[
\frac{3}{2} + \frac{3}{2} + 2 = 5.
\]
Thus:
\[
D = 4 - 5V,
\]
where $V$ is the number of vertices. For $V = 1$, $D = -1$, indicating that all loop diagrams are convergent. However, this does not override the fact that the coupling has negative mass dimension, which determines non-renormalizability.

### Conclusion
The mass dimension of $\kappa$ is $[\kappa]_M = -1$, and the theory is not renormalizable.
