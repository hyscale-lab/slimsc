Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these concepts. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The problem says that the state |alpha> is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. So first, I think I need to normalize this state because the coefficients are complex numbers, and normalization usually involves finding the modulus squared of each coefficient and adding them to get the probability, then dividing by that sum to get the normalized state.

So, the state is |alpha> = c1|up> + c2|down>, where c1 = (1+i) and c2 = (2 -i).

Wait, but the problem says it's proportional, so I guess I need to normalize it. So the normalization factor is 1 over the square root of the sum of the squares of the magnitudes of c1 and c2.

The magnitude of c1 is |1+i| = sqrt(1^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(2). So |c1|^2 is 2.

Similarly, |c2| is |2 - i|. The magnitude is sqrt(2^2 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(4 +1) = sqrt(5). So |c2|^2 is 5.

Adding those, 2 +5 =7. So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). So the state |alpha> is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

Wait, but before that, perhaps I should just compute the overall normalization. Because the sum is 7 as I found. So the state is (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> multiplied by 1/sqrt(7). So the coefficients are (1+i)/sqrt(7) and (2 -i)/sqrt(7).

Next, the operator whose matrix representation is given by A_ij. The matrix A has elements A_ij = ħ/2 if i != j, and 0 otherwise. Hmm, wait, what's the size of the matrix? Since it's a spin-1/2 system (because we're talking about spin up and down), the matrix is 2x2. So for a 2x2 matrix, the diagonal elements are zero, and the off-diagonal elements are ħ/2 each.

So the matrix A would look like:
[ 0    ħ/2 ]
[ ħ/2   0 ]

Wait, but wait. The matrix elements are A_ij = ħ/2 when i != j, but what about the diagonal? Since the problem says "if i is different from j, and 0 otherwise". So the matrix is:
A = [[0, ħ/2],
     [ħ/2, 0]]

Hmm, so this is the operator A. Now, the question is to find the probability of measuring each eigenstate of A when the system is in state |alpha>. Also, compute the average value of A.

Wait, that's a bit tricky. Because the eigenstates of A are not the same as the |up> and |down> states. Because the |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-component of spin, S_z.

So to find the probabilities, I probably need to find the eigenstates of the operator A. Because when you measure an operator, the possible outcomes are its eigenvalues, and the probabilities are the square of the amplitude of the corresponding eigenstate in the given state.

So first, let's find the eigenstates and eigenvalues of A.

The matrix A is:
[0, ħ/2]
[ħ/2, 0]

This is a 2x2 matrix. The eigenvalues can be found by solving the characteristic equation det(A - λI) = 0.

So the determinant is | -λ       ħ/2       |
                  | ħ/2      -λ |

Which is (-λ)(-λ) - (ħ/2)(ħ/2) ) = λ² - (ħ²/4) = 0.

So λ² = ħ²/4 → λ = ± ħ/2.

So the eigenvalues are λ_+ = ħ/2, λ_- = -ħ/2.

Now, to find the eigenvectors corresponding to each eigenvalue.

For λ = ħ/2:

(A - λ I) v = 0.
So:
[ -ħ/2   ħ/2 ] [a]   [0]
[ ħ/2   -ħ/2 ] [b] = [0]

So the equations are:
- (ħ/2) a + (ħ/2) b = 0 → -a +b =0 → b =a.

So the eigenvector is proportional to [1, 1]^T. But wait, let's normalize it. So the eigenvector can be written as (1,1)/sqrt(2), because the length is sqrt(1^2 +1^2) = sqrt(2). So the normalized eigenvector is |v+> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2).

Similarly, for λ = -ħ/2:

The matrix becomes:
[ ħ/2   ħ/2 ] [a]   [0]
[ ħ/2   ħ/2 ] [b] = [0]

Which gives (ħ/2)(a + b) =0 → a +b =0 → b = -a.

So the eigenvector is (1, -1)^T, normalized as (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2) → |v->.

So, the eigenstates of A are |v+> and |v->, with eigenvalues +ħ/2 and -ħ/2 respectively.

Now, the state |alpha> is given. We need to express |alpha> in terms of |v+> and |v->, because the probabilities are the square of the coefficients when expressed in the eigenbasis.

Wait, but |alpha> is already expressed in terms of |up> and |down>, which are the eigenbasis of S_z, not A. So perhaps I should first express |alpha> in the basis of A's eigenstates.

So, |alpha> = (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 - i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

Expressed in terms of |v+> and |v->:

Because |v+> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2)
and |v-> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

Let me write |up> and |down> in terms of |v+>, |v->:

We can solve for |up> and |down>:

|up> = (|v+> + |v->)/sqrt(2)
|down> = (|v+> - |v->)/sqrt(2)

So, substituting into |alpha>:

|alpha> = (1+i)/sqrt(7) [ (|v+> + |v->) / sqrt(2) ) ] + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) [ (|v+> - |v->) / sqrt(2) ) ]

Factor out 1/sqrt(2) and 1/sqrt(7):

= [1/(sqrt(7)*sqrt(2))] [ (1+i)(|v+> + |v->) + (2-i)(|v+> - |v->) ) ]

Let me expand the terms inside:

(1+i)(|v+> + |v->) = (1+i)|v+> + (1+i)|v->

(2-i)(|v+> - |v->) = (2-i)|v+> - (2-i)|v->

Adding these together:

= [ (1+i) + (2-i) ] |v+> + [ (1+i) - (2 -i) ] |v->

Compute coefficients:

(1+i) + (2 -i) = (1+2) + (i -i) )= 3 + 0i =3.

(1+i) - (2 -i) = (1-2) + (i +i) )= (-1) + 2i = (-1 + 2i).

So, |alpha> becomes:

[1/(sqrt(14))] [ 3 |v+> + (-1 + 2i) |v-> ]

Wait, because sqrt(7)*sqrt(2) is sqrt(14), so 1/sqrt(14) is the coefficient.

So the coefficients are 3 and (-1 + 2i), each multiplied by 1/sqrt(14).

Now, the probability of measuring each eigenstate is the square of the modulus of these coefficients.

First, for |v+>:

Coefficient is 3/(sqrt(14)). The modulus squared is (3)^2/(14) =9/14 ≈0.6429.

For |v->:

Coefficient: (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14). The modulus squared is ( (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ) /14 → (1 +4)/14 =5/14 ≈0.3571.

Wait, but wait: 9/14 is approximately 0.6429, and 5/14 is approximately 0.3571. So the probabilities are about 64% and 36% respectively.

Hmm, looking at the options, option A says 0.64 and 0.36. So that matches the probabilities.

So the first part's probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14, which is approximately 0.64 and 0.36.

Now, the average value of operator A. The average is given by <A> = <alpha| A |alpha>.

Alternatively, since A has eigenvalues ±ħ/2, and the state is a superposition of |v+> and |v->, the expectation value is the sum of the probabilities multiplied by their respective eigenvalues.

So <A> = (9/14)(ħ/2) + (5/14)(-ħ/2) )

= [ (9/14) - (5/14) ] (ħ/2 )

= (4/14) (ħ/2 )

= (2/7) (ħ/2 ) = (1/7) ħ.

So <A> is ħ/7.

Wait, but let me make sure I can compute it another way.

Another approach: express |alpha> as a column vector in the |up>, |down> basis.

|alpha> is [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) , (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ]^T.

The operator A is [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]].

So the expectation value is the conjugate transpose of |alpha> multiplied by A multiplied by |alpha>.

So <A> = [ (1-i)/sqrt(7) , (2 +i)/sqrt(7) ] * A * [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ; (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ]

Compute matrix multiplication:

A is [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]], so A * |alpha> is:

[0*(1+i) + (ħ/2)(2 -i) ] / sqrt(7) → (ħ/2)(2 -i)/sqrt(7)

[ (ħ/2)(1+i) + 0*(2-i) ] / sqrt(7) → (ħ/2)(1+i)/sqrt(7)

Then, the conjugate transpose dot product with |alpha>:

[ (1-i)/sqrt(7), (2 +i)/sqrt(7) ] multiplied by the result above.

So:

(1-i)/sqrt(7) * (ħ/2)(2 -i)/sqrt(7) + (2 +i)/sqrt(7) * (ħ/2)(1+i)/sqrt(7)

Factor out (ħ/2) / (7):

= (ħ/2) [ (1-i)(2 -i) + (2 +i)(1 +i) ] / 7

Compute each term:

First term: (1 -i)(2 -i) = (1*2) + (1*(-i)) + (-i *2) + (-i * -i)
= 2 -i -2i + i^2
= 2 -3i -1 (since i^2=-1)
= 1 -3i.

Second term: (2 +i)(1 +i) =2*1 +2*i +i*1 +i*i 
= 2 + 2i +i + i^2
= 2 +3i -1 → 1+3i.

Adding the two terms: (1-3i)+(1+3i) )= 2.

So <A> = (ħ/2) * (2) /7 → (2 ħ) / (2 *7 ) → ħ/7.

Hmm, so that's consistent with the earlier calculation.

So the average value is ħ/7.

Looking back at the options:

Option A: probabilities 0.64 and 0.36, average ħ/7.

So the correct answer would be option A.

Wait, but let me just make sure I didn't mix up the probabilities. The first eigenstate |v+> has probability 9/14 ≈0.6429, and |v-> has 5/14≈0.3571.

So the options say 0.64 and 0.36, which are approximate. So option A is correct.

To solve the problem, we start by normalizing the given state \( |\alpha\rangle \), which is proportional to \( (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \). The normalization factor is determined by the sum of the squared magnitudes of the coefficients:

\[
|1+i|^2 = 1^2 + 1^2 = 2, \quad |2-i|^2 = 2^2 + (-1)^2 = 5.
\]

Thus, the normalization factor is \( 1/\sqrt{7} \), and the normalized state becomes:

\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} |\uparrow\rangle + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} |\downarrow\rangle.
\]

Next, we consider the operator \( A \) with the matrix representation:

\[
A = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{\hbar}{2} \\
\frac{\hbar}{2} & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvalues of \( A \) are found by solving the characteristic equation \( \det(A - \lambda I) = 0 \):

\[
\lambda^2 - \left(\frac{\hbar}{2}\right)^2 = 0 \implies \lambda = \pm \frac{\hbar}{2}.
\]

The corresponding eigenvectors are:

\[
|v_+\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|\uparrow\rangle + |\downarrow\rangle), \quad |v_-\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|\uparrow\rangle - |\downarrow\rangle).
\]

We express \( |\alpha\rangle \) in the eigenbasis of \( A \). Using the relations:

\[
|\uparrow\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|v_+\rangle + |v_-\rangle), \quad |\downarrow\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|v_+\rangle - |v_-\rangle),
\]

we substitute into \( |\alpha\rangle \):

\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|v_+\rangle + |v_-\rangle) + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|v_+\rangle - |v_-\rangle).
\]

Simplifying:

\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{14}} \left[ \left( (1+i) + (2-i) \right)|v_+\rangle + \left( (1+i) - (2-i) \right)|v_-\rangle \right].
\]

\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{14}} \left[ 3|v_+\rangle + (-1+2i)|v_-\rangle \right].
\]

The coefficients of \( |v_+\rangle \) and \( |v_-\rangle \) are \( 3/\sqrt{14} \) and \( (-1+2i)/\sqrt{14} \), respectively. The probabilities of measuring the eigenstates are the squared magnitudes of these coefficients:

\[
P(|v_+\rangle) = \left| \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}} \right|^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.64, \quad P(|v_-\rangle) = \left| \frac{-1+2i}{\sqrt{14}} \right|^2 = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.36.
\]

The average value of \( A \) is given by:

\[
\langle A \rangle = P(|v_+\rangle) \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} + P(|v_-\rangle) \cdot \left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right).
\]

Substituting the probabilities:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{9}{14} \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} + \frac{5}{14} \cdot \left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right) = \frac{9\hbar}{28} - \frac{5\hbar}{28} = \frac{4\hbar}{28} = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

Thus, the probabilities are approximately \( 0.64 \) and \( 0.36 \), and the average value of \( A \) is \( \hbar/7 \). Comparing with the options, the correct answer is:

**Option A: 0.64, 0.36, and \( \hbar/7 \).**
