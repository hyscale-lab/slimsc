Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question is about the density matrix given by ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). I need to determine its geometrical position in the qubits space. The options are A, B, C, D with specific r coordinates.

Hmm, density matrices... I remember they describe the state of a quantum system, including both pure and mixed states. In this case, ρ looks like a mixture of |0⟩ and |1⟩. Wait, each term is a projection operator. So, since each term has a coefficient of 1/2, this must represent a classical mixture of the two states, each with equal probability. That would make it a mixed state, not a pure state.

Wait, but what's the geometrical position? Oh, right, density matrices are represented in the Bloch sphere for single qubits. The Bloch sphere is a geometric representation of the state space of a qubit. For a pure state |ψ⟩, the density matrix is |ψ⟩⟨ψ|, and its Bloch vector is determined by the coefficients of ψ.

But this is a mixed state. The density matrix for a completely mixed state (like ρ = I/2 for a qubit) would be in the center of the Bloch sphere, at the origin, because it's maximally mixed. But wait, what about a state that's an equal mixture of |0⟩ and |1⟩?

Wait, let me think. The density matrix ρ here is (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)/2. So each of these states |0⟩ and |1⟩ are orthogonal, each with probability 1/2.

In the Bloch sphere, |0⟩ is at (1,0,0) and |1⟩ is at (0,0,1). Wait no, wait. Wait, the Bloch sphere is a representation where any qubit state can be written as (I + r·σ)/2, where r is a vector and σ are the Pauli matrices.

So for a general state ρ, it can be written as (I + r·σ)/2, where r is the Bloch vector. So solving for r would give the coordinates.

Let me write down ρ in matrix form. |0⟩ is [1, 0], so |0⟩⟨0| is the matrix [[1,0],[0,0]]. Similarly, |1⟩⟨1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. So adding them gives [[1,0],[0,1]], which is I, the identity matrix. So ρ = (1/2) * I.

Wait a second! So ρ is the identity matrix multiplied by 1/2. So ρ is I/2. That's the maximally mixed state. Because for a qubit, the maximally mixed state is I/d where d is the dimension (d=2 here), which is indeed I/2.

Now, the maximally mixed state has no coherence and is in the center of the Bloch sphere. So its Bloch vector r is (0, 0, 0), because it's the origin.

Looking at the options, option C is r=(0,0,0). So the answer must be option C.

Wait, let me double-check. If the state were |+⟩, which is (|0⟩ + |1⟩)/√2, its density matrix would be |+⟩⟨+|, which would have off-diagonal terms of 1/2. But in our case, ρ has diagonal entries 1/2 each and off-diagonal zero. So it's a mixed state with no coherence, hence it's in the center. Yeah, so r is (0,0,0).

The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents a classical mixture of the states \(|0\rangle\) and \(|1\rangle\), each with equal probability \(1/2\). Since the off-diagonal terms of \(\rho\) are zero, this state has no coherence, indicating it is a mixed state rather than a pure state.

Density matrices can be represented using the Bloch sphere, where the state of a qubit is described by a Bloch vector \(r = (x, y, z)\). For a general density matrix \(\rho\), it can be expressed as 

\[
\rho = \frac{I}{2} + \frac{1}{2} \vec{r} \cdot \vec{\sigma},
\]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix, \(\vec{\sigma}\) are the Pauli matrices, and \(\vec{r}\) is the Bloch vector. The maximally mixed state for a qubit is given by \(\rho = \frac{I}{2}\), which corresponds to the origin of the Bloch sphere, i.e., \(r = (0, 0, 0)\).

In this case, \(\rho = \frac{I}{2}\), so the corresponding Bloch vector is \(r = (0, 0, 0)\). This matches option C.
