Okay, so I've got this physics problem about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

First, the problem says the astronauts have masses 2m and 3m, right? And they're moving at 0.6c and 0.5c, both in the positive x-direction. So, c is the speed of light, about 3e8 m/s, but I don't think I'll need the exact value here.

Wait, the question is asking for the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. I remember that in relativity, velocities don't just subtract normally. Oh, right! You can't just do v_rel = 0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c because that's not how relativity works. I think you have to use the velocity addition formula from special relativity.

The formula for relative velocity when two objects are moving at u and v relative to a rest frame is (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/(c²)). Oh wait, no, wait. Let me get that straight. If one frame is moving at speed u relative to another, and an object is moving at speed v in that frame, then the speed of the object in the original frame is (u + v)/(1 + (uv)/(c²)) when they're in the same direction. Wait, no, wait. Let me get the formula correct.

The correct formula for the relative velocity from the perspective of one astronaut to the other. Suppose astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, and astronaut B is moving at 0.5c, both in the same direction. From A's frame, what is B's speed?

Wait, no, actually, the problem says they are moving in the positive x-direction. So, both are moving in the same direction. So, from A's frame, what is B's speed? Wait no, wait. Wait, the problem is about their relative speed, so perhaps we need to find how fast each is moving relative to the other.

Wait, I think I need to calculate the relative speed correctly. Let me think. Let's say astronaut 2 is moving at velocity u = 0.6c relative to the lab frame, and astronaut 1 is moving at v = 0.5c relative to the lab frame. Wait no, the problem says the first astronaut has mass 2m and speed 0.6c, the second has 3m and 0.5c. So from astronaut 2's frame, what is astronaut 1's speed?

Wait, no, wait. The relative speed between the two astronauts would be the speed of one as seen from the other. So, for example, from astronaut 2's perspective, how fast is astronaut 1 moving?

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to compute the relative velocity using the formula. Let me think: if the two velocities are u and v in the same direction, then the relative velocity w is (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/(c²)).

Wait, no, wait. Let me recall the correct formula. The relative velocity formula when you have two objects moving in the same frame. Oh right, the formula for the relative velocity of two objects moving in the same direction is (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/(c²)). So in this case, u is 0.6c (the speed of the first astronaut relative to the lab), and v is 0.5c (the speed of the second astronaut relative to the lab). So the relative speed of the second astronaut as seen from the first would be (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)).

Let me compute that. The numerator is 0.1c. The denominator is 1 - (0.3c²)/(c²) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So the relative speed is (0.1c)/(0.7) = (0.1/0.7)c ≈ 0.1428 c, which is approximately 0.14c. So that's one part answered. Looking at the options, options C and D have relative speed 0.14c. So maybe the correct answer is either C or D.

Now the second part: the total energy of the system. Wait, the problem says "the total energy of the system." So the system comprises both astronauts. In relativity, the total energy is the sum of their individual relativistic energies.

The relativistic energy equation is E = gamma * m c², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So I need to calculate the energy for each astronaut and sum them.

First astronaut: mass 2m, speed 0.6c.

Gamma1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.

So energy E1 = gamma1 * 2m * c² = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

Second astronaut: mass 3m, speed 0.5c.

Gamma2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547.

So energy E2 = gamma2 * 3m c² ≈ 1.1547 *3 m c² ≈ 3.464 m c².

Total energy E = E1 + E2 ≈ 2.5 + 3.464 = 5.964 m c². Approximately 5.96 m c² when rounded.

Looking back at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc^2 and v_rel=0.14c, which matches our calculations. Option D says E=5mc², which is lower than what we calculated. So the correct option should be C.

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure I didn't mix up the velocities in the relative motion part. Because another possibility is that the relative speed is between the two as seen from the lab frame, but no, the question says "relative speed"—so it's the speed of one as seen from the other.

Wait, another approach: let me make sure the relative velocity formula is correct. The formula for the relative velocity between two objects moving at u and v in the same direction is (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/(c²)). So if u=0.6c, v=0.5c, then (0.1c)/(1 - 0.3) = 0.1 / 0.7 = 1/7 ≈ 0.1428c, which is 0.14c when rounded to two decimal places. So yes, that's correct.

And the total energy is the sum of both energies. So E1=2.5 mc², E2≈3.464 mc², sum to ~5.96 mc². So option C is correct.

To solve the problem, we need to calculate the relative speed of the two astronauts and the total energy of the system.

### Step 1: Relative Speed
The two astronauts are moving in the same direction with relativistic speeds of \( 0.6c \) and \( 0.5c \), respectively. The relative speed \( v_{\text{rel}} \) is calculated using the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{u - v}{1 - \frac{uv}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \( u = 0.6c \) and \( v = 0.5c \). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} \approx 0.14c
\]

Thus, the relative speed is \( 0.14c \).

### Step 2: Total Energy of the System
The total energy of the system is the sum of the relativistic energies of the two astronauts. The relativistic energy of an object is given by:

\[
E = \gamma mc^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

#### Energy of the first astronaut:
- Mass: \( 2m \)
- Speed: \( 0.6c \)
- \( \gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25 \)
- Energy: \( E_1 = \gamma_1 (2m)c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5mc^2 \)

#### Energy of the second astronaut:
- Mass: \( 3m \)
- Speed: \( 0.5c \)
- \( \gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547 \)
- Energy: \( E_2 = \gamma_2 (3m)c^2 \approx 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464mc^2 \)

#### Total Energy:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5mc^2 + 3.464mc^2 \approx 5.96mc^2
\]

### Final Answer
The relative speed is \( 0.14c \), and the total energy of the system is approximately \( 5.96mc^2 \). Comparing with the options, the correct answer is:
