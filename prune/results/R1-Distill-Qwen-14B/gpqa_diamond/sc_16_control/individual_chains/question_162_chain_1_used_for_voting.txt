Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius 2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my differential geometry, but let's see if I can work through this.

The metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, that looks a bit like a line element in two dimensions. Oh right, because it's only got dx and dy terms, so this is a 2D metric.

Wait, but the question is about a pseudosphere. Pseudosphere usually refers to something with negative curvature, right? Like the tractricoid, which has constant negative curvature. But wait, the pseudosphere in some contexts might refer to a specific surface, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe the question is about the metric's properties leading to a certain area calculation.

So, the area of a pseudosphere. Wait, in 3D, a sphere's area is 4πr². But this is a 2D metric, so perhaps it's a surface embedded in some higher dimension. Or perhaps it's a 2D surface with some curvature.

Wait, the metric is given in terms of 2D coordinates x and y. So maybe this is a 2D surface, and the question is about its area. Or perhaps it's a 2-sphere in 3D, but the metric is written in a different coordinate system.

Wait, the question says "the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2." Hmm. So perhaps I need to calculate the area using the given metric.

So, in general, the area of a 2D surface can be found by integrating the square root of the determinant of the metric tensor, but wait, no, actually the area element in 2D is sqrt(g) dx dy, where g is the determinant of the metric tensor. Wait, no, actually, for a metric in 2D written as ds² = g_{xx} dx² + 2g_{xy} dx dy + g_{yy} dy², the determinant is g = g_{xx}g_{yy} - (g_{xy})². So the area element is sqrt(g) dx dy.

In this case, the metric is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). So the metric tensor components are g_xx = 32/(4 - x² - y²), g_yy = same, and g_xy = 0 because there's no cross term. So the determinant g is g_xx * g_yy - (g_xy)^2, which is [32/(4 - x² - y²)]² because g_xy is zero. So sqrt(g) would be 32/(4 - x² - y²).

Wait, no: determinant is (32/(4 - r²))^2 where r² = x² + y². So sqrt(det) is 32/(4 - r²).

So the area is the integral over the surface of sqrt(det) dx dy. But wait, what are the limits of integration? Because the denominator is 4 - x² - y², that suggests that the domain is where 4 - x² - y² > 0, so x² + y² <4. So the coordinate x and y are within a circle of radius 2.

Wait, so the domain is a disk of radius 2. So the area would be the integral over this disk of 32/(4 - r²) r dr dθ, where r is the radial coordinate in polar coordinates.

Wait, but r here is sqrt(x² + y²) = x² + y² = r². So the integral becomes:

Area = ∫∫ [32/(4 - r²)] r dr dθ

Changing to polar coordinates, with x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ, so dx dy = r dr dθ.

So the integral is from θ=0 to 2π, and r from 0 to 2.

So:

Area = ∫ (θ=0 to 2π) ∫ (r=0 to 2) [32/(4 - r²)] * r dr dθ

Since the integrand is independent of θ, we can separate the integrals.

Area = (32) * ∫ (0 to 2π) dθ * ∫ (0 to 2) [ r/(4 - r²) ] dr

The integral over θ is 2π. So:

Area = 32 * 2π * ∫ (0 to 2) [ r/(4 - r²) ] dr

Hmm, the integral ∫ r/(4 - r²) dr. Let's compute that.

Let me make a substitution: let u = 4 - r². Then du/dr = -2r → (-1/2) du = r dr. So the integral becomes:

∫ [ r dr / (4 - r²) ] = ∫ (-1/2) du/u = (-1/2) ln|u| + C

So evaluating from 0 to 2:

At r=2: u=4 - (2)^2 =0. Uh-oh, denominator becomes zero. Wait, but wait, when r approaches 2 from below, u approaches 0, so ln(u) approaches negative infinity. But let's see what the integral actually evaluates to.

Wait, but when r approaches 2, the integrand r/(4 - r^2) behaves as 2/(4 - 4) → 2/0, which is infinity. So the integral might be divergent, which would mean the area is infinite.

Wait, but wait, let me compute the indefinite integral:

The integral from 0 to a (where a approaches 2 from below) of r/(4 - r²) dr is:

(-1/2) [ln|4 - r²| ] from 0 to a

= (-1/2) [ ln(4 - a²) - ln(4) ) ]

As a approaches 2, 4 - a² approaches 0. So ln(0) is negative infinity. So (-1/2) [ (-infty) - ln4 ) ] → positive infinity.

So the integral ∫ (0 to 2) r/(4 - r²) dr is divergent, tending to infinity.

So the area becomes 32 * 2π * (infinite) = infinity.

Wait, but the options include D) +∞. So the area is infinite.

But wait, why would the area be infinite? Because the metric is singular at r=2 (since denominator 4 - r² →0), which might correspond to a boundary or a point where the geometry breaks down. So the entire space is the disk r <2, but the area integral diverges because the metric's coefficient blows up at the boundary.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the geometry as a pseudosphere, which might have infinite area, like the tractricoid. Because I remember that the tractrix has a finite area, but the tractricoid (pseudosphere) has infinite surface area. Wait, no, the tractrix is a curve, and the pseudosphere is its 2D surface.

Wait, the tractricoid is a surface of constant negative curvature. The area of a pseudosphere (tractricoid) is finite? Or is it infinite?

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think. For a surface of revolution with constant negative curvature, what is its area? I think the pseudosphere has finite area. But wait, maybe in this particular metric, the area is infinite.

Wait, but this metric is in 2D. If the area integral is divergent, the area is infinite. So the answer would be D) +infty.

Looking back at the options:

A) 0
B) 4π(x² + y²)
C) 4π(x² − y²)
D) +infty

So the correct answer should be D) +infty.

The given metric is:

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left(dx^2 + dy^2\right),
\]

which describes a 2D surface. To find the area of the pseudosphere of radius \( r = 2 \), we calculate the area element using the determinant of the metric tensor. The metric components are \( g_{xx} = g_{yy} = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \) and \( g_{xy} = 0 \). The determinant of the metric is:

\[
g = g_{xx} g_{yy} - g_{xy}^2 = \left(\frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2}\right)^2.
\]

The area element is then:

\[
\sqrt{g} \, dx \, dy = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \, dx \, dy.
\]

Switching to polar coordinates (\( x = r \cos\theta \), \( y = r \sin\theta \)), the area element becomes:

\[
\frac{32}{4 - r^2} \, r \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

The domain of integration is the disk \( x^2 + y^2 < 4 \), corresponding to \( 0 \leq r < 2 \) and \( 0 \leq \theta < 2\pi \). The area is:

\[
\text{Area} = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^2 \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \, r \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

The integral over \( \theta \) is \( 2\pi \), so:

\[
\text{Area} = 32 \cdot 2\pi \int_0^2 \frac{r}{4 - r^2} \, dr.
\]

To evaluate \( \int_0^2 \frac{r}{4 - r^2} \, dr \), we use the substitution \( u = 4 - r^2 \), \( du = -2r \, dr \), which gives:

\[
\int \frac{r}{4 - r^2} \, dr = -\frac{1}{2} \int \frac{du}{u} = -\frac{1}{2} \ln|u| + C.
\]

Evaluating from \( r = 0 \) to \( r = 2 \), we find:

\[
\int_0^2 \frac{r}{4 - r^2} \, dr = -\frac{1}{2} \left[\ln(4 - r^2)\right]_0^2 = -\frac{1}{2} \left[\ln(0) - \ln(4)\right].
\]

As \( r \to 2 \), \( 4 - r^2 \to 0 \), so \( \ln(0) \to -\infty \). This causes the integral to diverge to infinity. Therefore, the area is infinite.

Given the options:

- **A)** \( 0 \): Incorrect, as the area is not zero.
- **B)** \( 4\pi(x^2 + y^2) \): Incorrect, as this is not the area.
- **C)** \( 4\pi(x^2 - y^2) \): Incorrect, as this is not the area.
- **D)** \( +\infty \): Correct, as the area integral diverges.

The area of the pseudosphere of radius \( r = 2 \) is infinite.
