Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about treating 1-bromobenzene-2-d with NaNH2 in a condensed ammonia solvent. Hmm, I remember that NaNH2 is a strong base, often used in dehydrohalogenation reactions. But wait, what's the structure of this compound?

1-bromobenzene-2-d... Oh wait, wait, maybe that's a typo. Oh wait, no, probably it's 1-bromo-2,2-dimethylbenzene. Because "d" could stand for two methyl groups, right? So the structure would be bromine attached to the benzene ring at position 1, and two methyl groups at position 2.

So the molecule is bromobenzene with two methyl groups on the adjacent carbon. So the structure would be like this: benzene ring where position 1 is Br, position 2 has two methyl groups. So the structure is 1-bromo-2,2-dimethylbenzene.

Now, when such a compound reacts with a strong base like NaNH2 in ammonia. I remember that dehydrohalogenation reactions typically involve the removal of a proton adjacent to the leaving group (like Br) to form a double bond. But wait, in aromatic substitution, sometimes elimination can happen, forming a benzene ring with a double bond, leading to a benzene ring with a substituent.

Wait, but wait, the starting material is already a benzene ring. So perhaps this is a case of elimination where a substituent is removed, leading to a ring contraction or expansion. No, that's probably not right. Alternatively, perhaps it's a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but I don't think that's likely here. Or maybe it's an elimination reaction, forming a double bond, but in the ring that's not possible because benzene is already aromatic. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing things up.

Wait a second, maybe I should think about the mechanism. So NaNH2 is a strong base and a good source of NH2- ions. The reaction conditions are in a condensed ammonia solvent, which is a polar aprotic solvent. So perhaps this is an elimination reaction, but in what context?

Wait, another thought: when a benzene ring has a substituent that can undergo elimination, like an alkyl halide, the base might abstract a beta hydrogen, leading to the formation of a double bond. Wait, but in this case, the substituent is a bromine on the benzene ring. The substituent itself is an aryl bromide, so elimination would require adjacent hydrogens. But if the substituent is on the benzene ring, perhaps the neighboring carbon is part of the ring. So maybe the base abstracts a hydrogen from the adjacent carbon, leading to the formation of a double bond between the carbon bearing Br and the adjacent carbon.

Wait, but the starting molecule is 1-bromo-2,2-dimethylbenzene. So the Br is on position 1, and the two methyl groups are on position 2. So the structure is a benzene ring with Br at position 1, and two methyl groups at position 2 (which is adjacent to position 1). So the structure would be:

Positions 1 (Br), 2 (two CH3), 3, 4, 5, 6.

Wait, but if the Br is on position 1, then positions 2 and 6 are adjacent. But in this case, the substituent is at position 2. So when the base acts, it might abstract a hydrogen from the methyl group on position 2. But wait, the methyl groups are on position 2, which is adjacent to position 1 (Br). So perhaps elimination could occur between position 1 (Br) and position 2, but wait, how?

Wait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think about possible elimination. For elimination, you need a leaving group (Br) and a hydrogen on a neighboring carbon. But in this structure, the Br is on the benzene ring, and the adjacent carbon (position 2) has two methyl groups. So the only possible H's adjacent to Br are on the position 2 methyl groups.

Wait, but the methyl groups are on position 2. So the structure is benzene with Br at position 1, and two methyl groups attached to position 2. So the adjacent carbon (position 2) has two methyl groups. So the H's on those methyl groups are adjacent to the Br.

So the base could abstract a hydrogen from a methyl group on position 2, leading to the formation of a double bond between position 1 and position 2. But wait, the ring is already aromatic, so can a double bond be formed there?

Wait, that's not possible because benzene is already a conjugated ring with three double bonds. So perhaps the elimination leads to the formation of a new ring structure. Or maybe that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation, where the Br leaves, and a double bond forms between the adjacent carbons. But wait, that would require a transition state where a proton is abstracted, the Br leaves, and a double bond forms. So in this case, elimination would happen, removing Br and forming a double bond between positions 1 and 2.

Wait, but wait, the structure is benzene. So if we eliminate Br and a hydrogen from position 2, would that create a double bond between position 1 and 2, but that's part of the benzene ring. I'm getting a bit confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is more about deprotonation leading to a benzene ring with a substituent that can undergo some kind of elimination. But I'm not quite getting it.

Wait, maybe I should think about the overall reaction. When benzyl halides or aryl halides react with strong bases like NaNH2, they can undergo elimination to form alkenes. Wait, but only if the structure allows. Alternatively, perhaps it's a case of forming a benzene ring with a substituted group that can eliminate, leading to a more substituted double bond.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is 1-bromo-2,2-dimethylbenzene, and the base abstracts a hydrogen from one of the methyl groups (on position 2), leading to the formation of a double bond between position 1 and 2. But how would that work?

Wait, benzene rings don't usually form double bonds in that way because they're already conjugated. So perhaps the elimination leads to the formation of a new ring structure, but that sounds unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic aromatic substitution. But NaNH2 is a strong base, and nucleophilic substitutions on benzene rings typically require activating groups. But in this case, the substituents are methyl groups, which are electron-donating, so they activate the ring towards electrophilic substitution but not necessarily nucleophilic. Also, NaNH2 isn't a good nucleophile in this solvent; it's more a base.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the bromide is in a position where it can be eliminated with a hydrogen from an adjacent carbon, leading to the formation of a new double bond outside the benzene ring. Wait, but that's not possible because the benzene ring is already all conjugated.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a ring expansion or contraction. Wait, maybe the elimination leads to the loss of the Br and the formation of a new ring. Hmm, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a Birch reduction, but that usually involves using metals like Na or Mg in ammonia and leads to the dihydroxylation of the ring. But NaNH2 isn't used in Birch reductions. So that's probably not it.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is an elimination where the Br leaves, and a double bond forms between C1 and C2. But wait, the ring is aromatic, so that might not be feasible. Alternatively, perhaps the ring becomes non-aromatic, which is unlikely as that would be a high energy state.

Wait, maybe I should draw the structure. So benzene ring: position 1 has Br, position 2 has two CH3 groups. So the structure would look like:

Br
|
C1
|
C2 (with two CH3 groups)
/
 \
C3 and C6 (maybe other substituents?)

Wait, but in reality, the benzene ring is a six-membered ring with alternating double bonds. So the Br is attached to C1, and C2 has two methyl groups attached.

Now, when NaNH2 is added, a strong base, it abstracts a β hydrogen. The β hydrogen would be on a carbon adjacent to the leaving group, which is Br here. So the β hydrogen would be on C2. So the base abstracts a hydrogen from C2, which is adjacent to C1 (Br). Then, the Br leaves, and the double bond forms between C1 and C2.

But wait, in a benzene ring, each carbon is bonded to two adjacent carbons via double bonds, so forming another double bond would disrupt the aromaticity. That can't happen because aromatic rings are stable and such a reaction would require a lot of energy. So maybe this elimination isn't feasible.

Hmm, perhaps I'm wrong in thinking that elimination occurs. Maybe another reaction is happening. Wait, maybe this is a case of dehydrohalogenation, leading to the formation of a benzene ring with a substituent that has a double bond. Wait, but how?

Wait, perhaps the methyl groups on position 2 can undergo elimination. Wait, but the base is strong enough to abstract a hydrogen from the methyl group, leading to the formation of a double bond between C1 and C2. But wait, C1 is already part of the benzene ring, which has conjugated double bonds. So adding another double bond would require breaking the existing ones, which is not possible without a lot of energy.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction isn't elimination but a substitution. But substitution on an aryl ring usually requires a good leaving group and specific conditions. Br is a decent leaving group, but without activating groups, substitution is unlikely here. Plus, the solvent is ammonia, which is a polar aprotic solvent but not a protic one.

Another thought: maybe the base abstracts a hydrogen from the benzene ring, leading to a benzyne intermediate. Wait, benzyne is a diradical or a triple bond in the ring. But benzyne formation typically occurs under strong basic conditions, like with NaNH2 and NH3. So perhaps the reaction forms benzyne.

Wait, but benzyne formation requires the loss of two substituents, usually two leaving groups like bromides. In this case, the molecule has only one Br. So maybe that's not possible.

Wait, but wait, the starting material is 1-bromo-2,2-dimethylbenzene. So only one Br. So perhaps benzyne isn't formed here because we don't have two leaving groups.

Hmm, perhaps I'm on the wrong track. Let me think again about the structure: the benzene ring has a Br at position 1 and two methyl groups at position 2. So the structure is o-bromo-dimethylbenzene.

When NaNH2 is added, it's a strong base. So maybe it deprotonates a hydrogen adjacent to the Br, leading to an elimination where the Br leaves, and a double bond forms between C1 and C2.

Wait, but in benzene, each carbon is connected via a double bond. So if the base abstracts a hydrogen from C2 (a methyl group), perhaps a double bond forms between C1 and C2, but that would mean that the ring would have to adjust its bonding. It would require the ring to lose aromaticity, which is not favorable.

Alternatively, perhaps the elimination leads to the formation of a new ring structure. But I'm not sure about that.

Wait, maybe the reaction doesn't proceed via elimination but via some other mechanism. Maybe the base abstracts a hydrogen, and the Br leaves, but what's formed then?

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a simple substitution. But substitution on an aromatic ring is usually difficult without activating groups. Since the ring has two methyl groups (activating), maybe the Br can be replaced by something else. But NaNH2 is a base, not a nucleophile. So substitution doesn't seem likely.

Wait, another possibility: elimination to form a new double bond adjacent to the benzene ring. But that would require the Br to leave and a double bond to form outside the ring, which would lead to a structure like styrene. But how?

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a ring-opening elimination. But benzene is very stable and doesn't open easily under such conditions.

Wait, maybe it's an elimination leading to the formation of a new ring. For example, if the Br is eliminated along with a hydrogen from a methyl group, forming a new double bond and a smaller ring. But I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, maybe the starting material is 1-bromo-2,2-dimethylbenzene, and upon elimination, it forms a cycloheptatriene or something else. But that sounds complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts a hydrogen from the methyl group, leading to the formation of a benzyl carbanion, but I'm not sure how that would proceed.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the reaction is dehydrohalogenation, leading to the formation of an alkene. So for 1-bromo-2,2-dimethylbenzene, the elimination would produce 1,2-dimethylbenzene with a double bond between C1 and C2. But wait, benzene already has double bonds; adding another would make it non-aromatic. So that's not possible.

Wait, maybe the product is 1,2-dimethylbenzene (but that's just toluene with two methyl groups?), but no, that's not correct because that's still a benzene ring.

Wait, perhaps the elimination leads to the formation of a new compound where the Br is replaced by a double bond. But that's not possible because in benzene, you can't just replace an atom with a double bond.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck here. Let me think about other possible reactions. Maybe the base abstracts a hydrogen from a methyl group (since methyl groups are good at donating hydrogens), leading to a carbocation adjacent to the Br. Wait, but in this case, the base is strong, so it's more likely to abstract a proton and induce elimination rather than form a carbocation.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the reaction leads to the formation of a benzyl group with a double bond. For example, if the Br is at position 1 and the methyl groups are at position 2, elimination would form a double bond between positions 1 and 2, leading to a structure like 1,2-dimethyl-1,2-diphenylethylene or something. But I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is o-bromotoluene with another methyl group. Wait, no, the starting material is 1-bromo-2,2-dimethylbenzene, so it's o-bromo-dimethylbenzene.

Wait, perhaps the reaction leads to the formation of 1,3-dimethylbenzene (meta-xylene) after elimination. But I don't see how that would happen.

Wait, maybe the reaction is an example of a Hofmann elimination, but that's typically for amides and amines. Alternatively, maybe it's an E2 elimination where the base abstracts a proton, and the Br leaves, forming a double bond.

But considering that the starting material is a benzene ring with substituents, perhaps the elimination leads to the formation of a new compound where the Br is replaced by a double bond, but I'm not sure how that would affect the ring structure.

Wait, perhaps the product is 1,2-dimethylbenzene with a double bond, but that would require breaking the aromaticity, which is unlikely. So maybe the reaction doesn't proceed as an elimination but does something else.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation leading to the formation of a new ring. For example, if the Br is eliminated along with a hydrogen from the adjacent methyl group, the ring could contract or expand. But I'm not familiar with such a reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction forms a new benzene ring with a substituent that's a double bond. But that doesn't make sense because benzene already has conjugated double bonds.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the possible products. The question is asking how many possible organic products are formed. The options are 4, 1, 2, or 3.

Wait, if the reaction leads to the elimination of Br and the formation of a double bond between C1 and C2, but that's not possible in the benzene ring. So perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed as elimination. Maybe it's a substitution, but that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the NaNH2 is acting as a base and deprotonating a benzylic hydrogen. Benzylic hydrogens are acidic because the resulting carbanion is stabilized by resonance with the aromatic ring. So if the base abstracts a hydrogen from a methyl group attached to the benzene ring, what happens?

But wait, the structure is 1-bromo-2,2-dimethylbenzene. The methyl groups are at position 2. So the base could abstract a hydrogen from one of those methyl groups. But methyl groups are not very acidic; their pKa is around 48-50, which is quite high. NaNH2 is a strong base with a pKa around 38 (for NH2^-), so it can deprotonate compounds with pKa ~50.

Wait, if the base deprotonates a methyl group, what happens? The methyl group on C2 would become CH2 with a negative charge. But that's probably not stable. Alternatively, perhaps the deprotonation leads to some elimination, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the reaction leads to the formation of an aromatic ring with fewer substituents. For example, eliminating H and Br to form a double bond, but that's again problematic because of the ring structure.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a simple substitution, but I don't see how that would happen.

Wait, perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed at all. But that's not an option here because the question implies a reaction occurs.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should look for similar reactions. Wait, 1-bromo-2,2-dimethylbenzene treated with NaNH2 in NH3. I think this is a dehydrohalogenation reaction leading to the formation of an aromatic ring with a methyl group and a double bond.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the base abstracts a hydrogen from a methyl group, leading to the formation of a benzyl carbanion. But that's not very stable. Alternatively, perhaps the carbanion could lose a methyl group, but that's not common.

Wait, perhaps the reaction forms a new ring. Let's imagine that elimination occurs, and the Br and a methyl group are lost, forming a new double bond and a smaller ring. But I'm not sure about the specifics.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction forms a new product where the Br is eliminated, and a double bond forms between C1 and C2, leading to the formation of a new compound, but I'm not sure how that would affect the ring.

Wait, perhaps the reaction leads to the loss of Br and a hydrogen, forming a double bond, but that would require the ring to lose aromaticity, which is unlikely. So maybe no reaction occurs, but that's not one of the options.

Wait, maybe the reaction leads to the formation of a new compound with a propenyl group attached to the benzene ring. Wait, but that's not matching the structure.

Hmm, perhaps I should consider that the reaction doesn't proceed via elimination but via some other mechanism, like substitution. But again, I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic aromatic substitution. For that to happen, the ring should be activated towards nucleophilic attack. But methyl groups are activating, but they are meta directors. Wait, no, methyl groups are activating and ortho/para directors for electrophilic substitution, but for nucleophilic substitution, the ring needs to be strongly activated, usually with strong electron-withdrawing groups like nitro groups. So in this case, without such groups, nucleophilic substitution is unlikely.

So perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed via nucleophilic substitution.

Wait, perhaps it's a case of forming a benzene ring with a substituent that's a double bond. But I'm not sure.

At this point, I'm getting a bit stuck, so maybe I should think about the possible products. The question is how many products are formed.

If the reaction leads to the elimination of Br and a hydrogen from position 2, perhaps forming a double bond between C1 and C2. But since benzene is aromatic, that would require the ring to lose its aromaticity, which is not favorable. So perhaps this doesn't happen, meaning no reaction occurs, but that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to the formation of a new compound where the Br is replaced by a double bond in a way that the ring remains aromatic. But I don't see how that's possible.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a ring expansion. Eliminating Br and a hydrogen would form a new double bond, but that would require the ring to expand to seven members, which is not common.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction forms a new benzene ring with a substituent that's a methyl group and a double bond elsewhere. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the reaction forms a new compound where the Br is replaced by a double bond, but that would require the benzene ring to become non-aromatic, which is unlikely.

Hmm, perhaps the reaction is not possible, but that's not an option here.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about what NaNH2 does in such reactions. NaNH2 is a strong base, often used for deprotonation reactions, especially in the formation of anions. It can also induce elimination reactions.

So in this case, the starting material has two methyl groups on position 2 and a Br on position 1. Perhaps the base abstracts a hydrogen from one of the methyl groups, leading to the formation of a carbanion. Then, the Br leaves, and a double bond forms between C1 and C2.

But wait, the ring would need to adjust its structure to accommodate that. So the product would be a benzene ring with a double bond between C1 and C2, but that's impossible because the ring is already aromatic.

Alternatively, perhaps the elimination leads to the formation of a new ring structure, such as a five-membered ring. But I'm not sure.

Hmm, perhaps I should consider that the reaction leads to the formation of two products. Wait, why two? Because the two methyl groups are on the same carbon, so eliminating either one might lead to the same product. Wait, but in 1-bromo-2,2-dimethylbenzene, the two methyl groups are on the same carbon. So if the base abstracts a hydrogen from either methyl group, it's the same position. So elimination would occur in only one way.

Wait, but the base could abstract a hydrogen from either of the two methyl groups on position 2. But since they're both on the same carbon, the resulting product would be the same. So only one product would form.

But wait, perhaps the ring can form two different products due to the position of the double bond. Or maybe there's a possibility of forming more than one product based on the substitution pattern.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction doesn't proceed as an elimination but instead leads to the formation of a single product via substitution.

Wait, this is really confusing. Let me try to think of another angle. Maybe the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation to form a new compound. For example, the Br is eliminated along with a hydrogen from the adjacent methyl group, leading to the formation of a double bond between C1 and C2. The product would then be 1,2-dimethylbenzene with a double bond, but that's not possible because benzene is aromatic.

Wait, maybe the product is a diene, but that requires more than one elimination.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't eliminate both Br and a hydrogen but instead abstracts a hydrogen, leading to some kind of rearrangement.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction forms a new ring structure, but I'm not familiar with that mechanism.

Wait, another possible reaction: the base could abstract a hydrogen from the benzene ring, leading to a radical or a carbanion, but I'm not sure.

Hmm, perhaps it's better to consider the possible products. If the reaction forms a single product, the answer would be option B) 1. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: when 2,2-dimethyl-1-bromobenzene reacts with a strong base like NaNH2, the base abstracts a hydrogen from one of the methyl groups, leading to the formation of a carbanion. Then, the Br leaves as Br-, and a double bond forms between C1 and C2. However, this would require the ring to lose its aromaticity, which is highly unfavorable. So perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed, but that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction forms a new compound where the Br is replaced by a double bond, but that's not possible.

Wait, perhaps the reaction leads to the formation of a cyclopropane ring or something else, but I can't think of a mechanism for that.

Hmm, I'm really stuck. Maybe I should think about the number of possible products. The options are 4, 1, 2, or 3. If the reaction leads to the formation of only one product, the answer is B) 1. But I'm not confident.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction forms two products, such as the formation of two different isomers due to different positions of elimination. But I don't see how that would happen because the starting material is symmetric.

Wait, the starting material is 1-bromo-2,2-dimethylbenzene. The two methyl groups are on the same carbon, so the structure is symmetric around the Br. So any elimination would lead to a single product because there's no possibility for different positions.

So in that case, only one product would form. So the answer would be option B) 1.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The reaction involves treating 1-bromo-2,2-dimethylbenzene with NaNH₂ in a condensed ammonia solvent. NaNH₂ is a strong base, and the reaction likely proceeds via an elimination mechanism. The starting material has a bromine atom at position 1 and two methyl groups at position 2 on the benzene ring. 

In this reaction, the base NaNH₂ abstracts a β-hydrogen from one of the methyl groups at position 2, which is adjacent to the carbon bearing the bromine. This leads to the elimination of HBr and the formation of a double bond between positions 1 and 2. However, the benzene ring is aromatic and cannot accommodate an additional double bond without losing its aromaticity. This suggests that the reaction does not proceed as an elimination to form a new double bond within the ring.

Given the symmetry of the starting material (the two methyl groups are identical, and the bromine is at a single position), there is no possibility for forming multiple distinct products. The reaction conditions and the structure of the starting material make it highly unlikely for multiple isomers or alternative products to form. Therefore, only one product is possible under these reaction conditions.

Answer: B
