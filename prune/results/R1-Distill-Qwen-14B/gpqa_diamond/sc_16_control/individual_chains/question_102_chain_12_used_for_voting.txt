Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this multiple-choice question about a scientific experiment involving ligand-receptor pairs and some genetic constructs. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

So, the question describes a situation where a new ligand-receptor pair is identified in neural crest cells. The goal is to understand their developmental fate. The setup involves some vectors and genetic engineering techniques, and the problem is that after some experiments, there's no green signal observed under the confocal microscope.

Let me parse the setup. The vector is bicistronic, meaning it has two ORFs (open reading frames). The ligand ORF is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry. The receptor ORF is 3', fused to eGFP at the C-terminus. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, and the receptor has an IRES upstream. 

Wait, I remember that IRES elements allow for internal ribosome entry sites, which can drive the expression of a second gene after the first. So the ligand is expressed from the CBA promoter as its own ORF, and the receptor expression is under the control of the IRES, which would be after the ligand's ORF. So the vector probably has Ligand-ORF followed by IRES, then Receptor-ORF with eGFP.

But there's more about stop cassettes. Between ligand ORF and mCherry, there's a stop in a loxP-stop-loxP cassette. And between receptor and eGFP, a stop in lox2272-stop-lox2272. Hmm, loxP sites are used by Cre recombinase to excise DNA between them. So, the idea is probably that Cre will excise the stop cassette, allowing the downstream reporter to be expressed.

Wait, so the ligand is fused to mCherry. But wait, the ligand's ORF is followed by a stop cassette, which would stop translation. But if Cre is present, it would excise the loxP-stop-loxP, allowing the ligand to be expressed with mCherry? Or maybe the other way around. I'm a bit confused.

Similarly, the receptor ORF is followed by a stop in a lox2272 cassette. So, when Cre is present, it would excise that and let eGFP be expressed alongside the receptor.

Wait, but the vector is bicistronic, meaning two proteins are expressed from one transcript. The ligand and receptor ORFs are in the same transcript but are separate because of the IRES. So, the transcript would have the ligand ORF under CBA, then IRES, then receptor ORF.

But the stop cassettes complicate things. So, for the ligand, if there's a loxP-stop between the ligand and mCherry, that stop would prevent mCherry from being expressed unless the loxP sites are recombined, which would delete the stop. Similarly for the receptor-eGFP.

But the ligand is fused to mCherry—does that mean they are co-expressed? Or is it that the ligand is followed by a stop, and then mCherry? Or is the ligand's ORF fused with mCherry? Hmm, the exact setup is a bit unclear, but I think the idea is that Cre would delete the stop cassettes, allowing mCherry and eGFP to be expressed.

Wait, no. The ligand ORF is at 5', fused to mCherry. So, the ligand is part of the same construct as mCherry? Or is it that the ligand has mCherry attached to it? Or is mCherry a separate reporter? I'm getting a bit stuck.

But moving on, the experiment. They transfected the plasmid into primary astrocyte culture and used antibodies against the overexpressed proteins. They did a Western blot and saw signals proportional to actin, so that's a loading control. Then they made a mouse model homozygous for the construct in a wild-type background. They crossed these mice with SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice. 

SOX10 is a transcription factor important in neural crest development, and I remember that Cre is often used under the control of a tissue-specific promoter. So SOX10-Cre would mean that Cre is expressed in cells that express SOX10, such as neural crest derivatives.

After the offspring are born, they visualize them under a confocal with presumably GFP and other markers. But they don't see a green signal. So the eGFP isn't being expressed.

So the question is why there's no green signal. The options are about the relationship between ligand and receptor, whether the receptor-eGFP is stuck in the Golgi, whether an enhancer is missing, or whether the receptor and eGFP are not in frame.

Let me think about each option.

Option A: ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship. Paracrine means they act on nearby cells. But if the ligand is expressed in one cell and the receptor in another, maybe the signaling isn't autocrine, but does that affect the expression of the GFP? Not directly. Unless the expression isn't happening in the same cells, but I'm not sure how that would lead to no GFP.

Option B: the receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi. So, if the receptor-eGFP isn't properly trafficked to the cell surface, then it wouldn't fluoresce. But if the construct is faulty, perhaps the eGFP isn't being made at all. But if the eGFP is fused to the receptor, maybe the trafficking is impaired. But why would that happen? If the eGFP is expressed, but perhaps the receptor's structure is preventing it from getting to the surface. But in this case, the problem is that the GFP isn't observed. Alternatively, maybe the construct is not being made properly, so the eGFP isn't expressed.

Option C: the enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing. The ligand is under the CBA promoter. I think the CBA promoter is a strong, constitutive promoter. So if the promoter is missing, then the ligand wouldn't be expressed. But the mouse model is homozygous for the construct, so the vector is present. Wait, but the vector is a bicistronic construct with CBA for the ligand and IRES for the receptor. If the enhancer is missing, perhaps the CBA promoter isn't working. But I'm not sure if the CBA promoter requires an enhancer. Or perhaps the IRES is not functional, so the receptor isn't expressed. But the Western blot was done on transfected cells, and they saw signals proportional to actin—so perhaps the proteins are being expressed.

Option D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. So the fusion protein might not be functional. But if they're not in frame, the eGFP wouldn't be expressed because the stop codon would terminate translation early. So the eGFP wouldn't be produced, hence no fluorescence.

Wait, but the question says the ligand is fused to mCherry, and the receptor is fused to eGFP. So perhaps the ligand and mCherry are in the same protein (like a fusion), and the receptor and eGFP are another fusion. So both are under the same construct. If the eGFP is not in frame, then when the receptor is translated, the eGFP might not be correctly added, or the ribosome would stop early, so eGFP isn't made. So the eGFP wouldn't be expressed.

But in the setup, the eGFP is at the C-terminus of the receptor. So the construct would be something like: Ligand-mCherry (with loxP-stop before mCherry?), but wait, I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, the ligand ORF is followed by a stop in a loxP cassette, then mCherry. So without Cre, the ligand is expressed, followed by a stop, so mCherry isn't expressed. But with Cre, the stop is removed, so the ligand and mCherry are co-expressed.

Wait, I think the setup is that the ligand is under the CBA promoter, followed by a stop in a loxP cassette, then mCherry. So the ligand is expressed, and the stop prevents mCherry from being expressed unless Cre deletes the loxP cassette. Similarly, the receptor is under the IRES, followed by a stop in a lox2272 cassette, then eGFP. So Cre would delete the lox2272 cassette, allowing the receptor and eGFP to be expressed together.

But in the experiment, they used a mouse model homozygous for the construct. Then they crossed with SOX10-Cre. SOX10-Cre is supposed to activate Cre in neural crest cells, which would delete the loxP and lox2272 cassettes, allowing the mCherry and eGFP to be expressed.

But why isn't the eGFP showing up?

So in the mouse, the construct is present, and Cre is active in neural crest derivatives (since SOX10 is involved there). So the loxP and lox2272 cassettes should be excised, leading to expression of mCherry and eGFP.

But the eGFP isn't being expressed. So why?

Option D suggests that the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. If the eGFP is not in frame, then when the receptor is translated, the frame would cause a premature stop codon, and eGFP wouldn't be expressed. So the GFP wouldn't fluoresce.

Wait, but the construct is designed as Receptor-eGFP. So the ORF is the receptor followed by eGFP, in frame? Or are they in separate ORFs?

Wait, the vector is bicistronic, which means two separate ORFs. So the ligand and receptor are two separate ORFs, each under their own regulatory elements. The ligand is under CBA, and the receptor is under IRES.

But the stop cassettes are between each ORF and their respective fluorescent proteins. So the ligand ORF is followed by a stop cassette, then mCherry. The receptor ORF is followed by a stop cassette, then eGFP.

So, without Cre, the ligand is expressed but mCherry isn't. Receptor is expressed but eGFP isn't. With Cre, the stops are removed, so ligand and mCherry are both expressed, and receptor and eGFP are both expressed.

In the mouse, the Cre is active (from SOX10-Cre), so the stops are removed. So the eGFP should be expressed.

But in the experiment, the eGFP isn't visible. So why?

If the eGFP isn't expressed, perhaps the construct isn't working. The options suggest possible issues.

Option C: the enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing. But the CBA promoter is a strong promoter, so perhaps enhancer elements are not necessary. Unless the IRES element requires an enhancer, but that's unclear.

Option B: the receptor-eGFP is stuck in the Golgi. That could happen if the construct is misfolded and can't exit the ER, but that would mean the eGFP is present but not at the cell surface. However, the question is whether it's expressed at all. If it's stuck in the Golgi, you might not see fluorescence, but the Western blot should detect the protein. But the question says they used antibodies against overexpressed proteins, and the Western blot shows signals proportional to actin. So perhaps the proteins are being expressed, but not in the right place for detection.

Wait, but in the Western blot, they would detect the presence of the proteins via antibodies, regardless of their localization. So if eGFP is expressed, the blot would show it. But in the question, the Western blot is done after transfecting the plasmid into astrocytes, not in the mice. So perhaps the plasmid works, but the mouse construct isn't being expressed.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. The Western blot was done on transfected primary astrocytes. The mouse model is a separate experiment. So the fact that the Western blot worked in the transfected cells suggests that the vector is functional. But in the mouse, the eGFP isn't showing up.

Wait, but the mouse has the construct inserted into its genome. If the mouse is homozygous, then each allele has the construct. When crossed with SOX10-Cre, the Cre would excise the loxP and lox2272 stops in the cells where SOX10 is expressed (like in neural crest derivatives). So the eGFP should be expressed in those cells. But in the offspring, no green signal is observed.

So why isn't the eGFP expressed?

Option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. If the ORF for the receptor and eGFP are not in the same reading frame, when the receptor is translated, the eGFP might not be expressed. Because the stop codon would be encountered before eGFP is translated. So the eGFP wouldn't be made. Therefore, no GFP signal.

Alternatively, perhaps the issue is that the stop cassette wasn't properly excised. But the presence of Cre should do that. Or maybe the Cre isn't active in the cells where the construct is expressed.

Wait, but the Cre is under the SOX10 promoter, which should be active in neural crest cells. So the construct should be excised there, allowing the eGFP to be expressed.

Another thing: sometimes, when using different lox sites (like loxP and lox2272), the Cre might not efficiently excise the cassette if it's a different recombinase. Wait, lox2272 is a variant of the loxP site that is recognized by Cre. I think Cre can recognize both, but perhaps the arrangement matters. Or maybe the lox sites are in the wrong orientation.

Wait, the ligand's stop cassette is loxP-stop-loxP, and the receptor's is lox2272-stop-lox2272. So if Cre is added, it should delete the stops, enabling the expression of mCherry and eGFP. But if the lox sites are in the same orientation, Cre would delete the stop cassettes, allowing the fluorescent proteins to be expressed.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the lox sites are facing in the wrong direction, so Cre can't excise the stops. Or perhaps the vector isn't designed correctly, so the stop cassettes aren't flanked by lox sites in the right way for Cre to delete them.

Wait, but the problem is that the eGFP isn't expressed. So the most likely reason is that the eGFP isn't being made. So either the eGFP construct isn't expressed, or it's not in frame.

Option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. So when the receptor is translated, the ribosome would read through, but if the eGFP isn't in the same frame, the eGFP wouldn't be made, and perhaps a premature stop codon would terminate the receptor's translation. But if the eGFP is in a different frame, the receptor might still be translated correctly, but eGFP isn't.

But in that case, the eGFP wouldn't be expressed, so no GFP signal.

Alternatively, perhaps the eGFP isn't being expressed because the stop cassette wasn't excised. But why wouldn't it be excised? Maybe the Cre isn't active in the cells where the construct is expressed. But the SOX10-Cre is supposed to target neural crest cells, so if the receptor is expressed in those cells, the Cre should have acted.

Another angle: the vectors might have been inserted into a region of the genome where the expression is not active. But the question says the mouse is homozygous, so it's probably a germline insertion, so all cells should have it.

Wait, the vector is a bicistronic construct. So the IRES is important for the second ORF. If the IRES isn't functional, the receptor might not be expressed. But in the Western blot, the proteins were detected, so perhaps the IRES works.

Wait, but the Western blot was done on transfected primary astrocytes. So perhaps the construct works in vitro, but not in the in vivo mouse model for some reason. Or maybe the promoter isn't active in the mouse.

Wait, the ligand is under CBA promoter. I think CBA is a strong promoter, so it should drive expression in many cell types. The receptor is under IRES, which is after the ligand. So in the mouse, with Cre, both ORFs should be expressed. But if the IRES isn't working, then the receptor wouldn't be expressed, but the ligand would. But in that case, eGFP wouldn't be expressed either.

Hmm. The possible options are a bit tricky. Let me think about each option again.

Option A: Paracrine relationship. If ligand and receptor are secreted and act on other cells, then the eGFP wouldn't be expressed in the same cell as the receptor. But if the construct is designed to express both in the same cell, but they act on neighboring cells, perhaps the eGFP isn't in the same cell. But the question says they don't see any green signal, so even if it's in other cells, they might not see it. But I'm not sure if that's the intended answer here.

Option B: Receptor-eGFP stuck in Golgi. So the protein is made but not at the cell surface. But in the Western blot, you should see the protein regardless. But the question doesn't mention the blot results in the mouse, only that the offspring don't show GFP. So perhaps the protein is made but not fluorescent because it's mislocalized. But without knowing the blot results in the mice, it's hard to say.

Option C: Enhancer missing. If the CBA promoter isn't working, ligand isn't expressed. But the vector's in the mouse, and the Western blot worked in the transfected cells, so the promoter is functional.

Option D: Receptor and eGFP not in frame. So the eGFP isn't expressed. So no GFP.

Which is more likely? If the receptor and eGFP are in the same ORF, but not in frame, the eGFP wouldn't be translated. However, the setup says the receptor ORF is at the 3' and fused to eGFP at C-terminus. So I think the receptor and eGFP are in the same frame, meaning they are a fusion protein. So if they're not in frame, then the eGFP part would be out of frame, leading to a premature stop codon and no eGFP.

Alternatively, perhaps the eGFP is in a separate ORF. If the stop cassette wasn't excised, eGFP isn't expressed. But the Cre should have deleted it.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that the stop cassette for the receptor-eGFP is using lox2272, which is a different site than loxP. So the Cre might not have recombined it. Wait, no, because Cre can recognize lox2272 sites. So that's probably not the issue.

Another thought: the presence of loxP and lox2272 in the vector might cause unintended recombination if Cre is present, but that's probably not the case here.

Wait, the ligand's stop is flanked by loxP, and the receptor's by lox2272. So when Cre is active, it should delete both stops, allowing both fluorescent proteins to be expressed. But if the vector isn't correctly designed, perhaps the lox sites are in the wrong orientation. For example, if a lox site is followed by another in the same orientation, Cre would delete the intervening DNA. So if the construct has loxP-stop-loxP, Cre would delete the stop. Similarly for lox2272.

So if the design is correct, the stops should be removed.

But maybe the problem is that the lox sites are in the wrong orientation. For example, if the lox sites are in a forward and reverse orientation, Cre would invert the stop cassette but not delete it. So the stop would still be present, preventing eGFP expression.

If that's the case, then the eGFP wouldn't be expressed, leading to no green signal.

But the options don't mention anything about lox site orientation. So among the given options, the most likely are options B, C, D.

If the eGFP isn't in frame, then it won't be expressed. So option D.

Alternatively, the IRES may not be functional, but that would be an issue with the vector design, not an option here.

Wait, but the question is about why the eGFP isn't expressed. If the receptor and eGFP are not in frame, the eGFP won't be made. So the answer would be D.

Another possibility is that the eGFP is expressed but not fluorescent for another reason. For example, if the eGFP is not correctly folded, but that's not one of the options.

So, putting it all together, the most likely reason is that the eGFP isn't in frame with the receptor, so it isn't expressed. Hence, no green signal.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves a bicistronic vector expressing a ligand and receptor pair, with fluorescent proteins (mCherry and eGFP) fused to them. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, and the receptor is under an IRES element. Stop cassettes with loxP and lox2272 sites flank the fluorescent proteins, allowing Cre recombinase to excise the stops and enable co-expression of the ligand-mCherry and receptor-eGFP constructs. The experiment involves transfecting the vector into primary astrocytes and testing expression via Western blot, followed by crossing a mouse model homozygous for the construct with SOX10-Cre mice to visualize eGFP under a confocal microscope. However, no green signal is observed, and the task is to determine the most likely reason.

### Key Analysis of Options:

1. **Option A: Ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship**  
   A paracrine relationship implies the ligand acts on neighboring cells, but this does not explain the absence of eGFP fluorescence in the same cell where the receptor-eGFP should be expressed. Additionally, the construct is designed for co-expression in the same cell, so this is unlikely to be the cause.

2. **Option B: The receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi**  
   If the receptor-eGFP were mislocalized in the Golgi, it would still be expressed but not fluoresce at the cell surface. However, the Western blot detected the proteins, indicating proper expression. This option does not fully explain the absence of fluorescence.

3. **Option C: The enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing**  
   The CBA promoter is a strong, constitutive promoter that does not require an enhancer. The Western blot confirmed protein expression in transfected astrocytes, indicating the promoter is functional. Thus, this option is unlikely.

4. **Option D: The receptor and eGFP are not in frame**  
   If the receptor and eGFP are not in the same reading frame, translation of the receptor would terminate prematurely, preventing eGFP expression. This would result in no green signal, aligning with the observed outcome. This is the most plausible explanation.

### Conclusion:
The absence of eGFP fluorescence is most likely due to the receptor and eGFP not being in frame, preventing eGFP expression.
