Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about the mean free path of gas molecules in an electron microscope setup. Hmm, let me start by breaking down what I know.

Mike is working with a high-resolution transmission electron microscope (TEM) that's operating at 1000 kV. He's using vacuum pumps to get an ultra-high vacuum state, which is less than 10^-9 Torr. The idea is to minimize gas molecules in the sample compartment because having too many can interfere with the electron beam, right? But despite the pumps, some gas particles are still there, and Mike measured the mean free path of these molecules as λ1. The mean free path is the average distance a molecule travels between collisions, so in a vacuum, you'd expect it to be longer because there are fewer molecules to bump into.

Then, when Mike turns on the electron beam, something interesting happens. The mean free path changes from λ1 to λ2. But the temperature is the same, so that shouldn't affect the mean free path directly. Wait, temperature affects the average speed of molecules, which in turn affects the mean free path. But since the temperature didn't change, maybe that's not the issue here.

Why would the mean free path change when the electron beam is on? Oh, I remember that electrons in the beam can interact with the gas molecules. The gas molecules are in the vacuum chamber, and when the electron beam is active, electrons are moving through the space. These electrons can cause the gas molecules to ionize or maybe even dislodge them from their paths. Or perhaps the electrons are scattering off the gas molecules, causing them to move, which would change their distribution and thus the mean free path.

Wait, but the mean free path is calculated based on the number density of the gas. The formula I remember is λ = 1/(√2 * n * σ), where n is the number density and σ is the collision cross-section. So if the number of gas molecules changes, λ changes.

But in this case, when the electron beam is on, maybe the gas molecules are being bombarded by electrons, causing them to move more. Or perhaps the electrons are causing the gas to heat up, but the question states the temperature remained the same, so thermal expansion isn't the case.

Another thought: When the electron beam is active, it's a high-energy beam. High-energy electrons can cause gas molecules to become ionized. Ionized particles would have different properties. For example, if a gas molecule is ionized, it might have a different mass or charge, which would affect its behavior in the vacuum. But how does that affect the mean free path?

Well, if gas molecules are ionized, they might be more likely to stick to the walls of the chamber or be drawn towards the electron source due to electric fields. Wait, another possibility is that the electron beam causes the gas to be more dispersed. Hmm, but I'm not sure about that.

Wait, perhaps the electron beam creates a sort of electric field in the chamber. If the gas molecules are ionized, they could be accelerated by this field, which might cause them to move more rapidly or change their distribution. But I'm not certain how this would affect the mean free path.

Alternatively, when the electron beam is on, the gas molecules might experience more scattering events because the electrons are knocking into them more frequently. But wait, the mean free path is the average distance before a collision. So if the electron beam is causing the gas molecules to move more, perhaps increasing the rate of collisions, that would decrease λ.

Wait, but the mean free path is about gas molecule collisions with each other, not with electrons. Oh, right! The mean free path λ1 was determined before the electron beam was on. So λ1 is for the gas in the chamber under ultra-high vacuum, considering only their mutual collisions.

When the electron beam is turned on, the electrons are moving through the same space. The electrons can collide with the gas molecules, causing them to move or change direction. But how does that affect the gas molecules' mean free path?

Ah, wait a second. The presence of the electron beam introduces a new factor: electron-gas molecule collisions. So, the gas molecules are now being hit by electrons, which are much more energetic. Each time a gas molecule is hit by an electron, it might change its trajectory. So, the gas molecules are experiencing more collisions now because they're colliding with the electrons as well as with each other. 

So, the mean free path of the gas molecules would be the average distance they travel before either colliding with another gas molecule or an electron. But when the electron beam is off, their collisions are only with other gas molecules. So with the electron beam on, their mean free path would be shorter because they collide more frequently—either with each other or with electrons.

So, the original λ1 was the mean free path without considering electron collisions. With the beam on, the gas molecules have more frequent collisions, so their mean free path λ2 would be shorter than λ1. So λ2 < λ1.

Wait, but I should think about what factors affect the mean free path. The formula λ = 1/(n σ √2), where n is the number density, σ is the collision cross-section. If the number density n increases, λ decreases. But Mike's setup didn't change the number of gas molecules; the pumps were working, so n should remain the same. Unless the beam increases the rate of collisions, which would effectively make the effective n higher in some sense.

Alternatively, perhaps when the electrons are present, the gas molecules are more likely to be ionized, and the ionized species have more charge, which affects their cross-sections. For example, charged particles may have a larger cross-sectional area for collisions, increasing σ. If σ increases, then λ decreases because λ is inversely proportional to σ.

Another angle: when the electron beam is on, gas molecules might be more likely to stick to the walls or be pumped out, which would lower the pressure, but in the scenario, the pressure is already ultra-low, and the pumps are probably working. But the question says that the presence of gas was detected, so the pressure isn't zero.

Alternatively, perhaps the electron beam causes gas molecules to be scattered more, effectively increasing the rate of collisions, thus reducing the mean free path. So λ2 is less than λ1.

So the conclusion is that λ2 is less than λ1, which would correspond to option C: λ2 < λ1.

The mean free path (λ) of gas molecules in a vacuum is determined by factors such as the number density (n) of the gas, the collision cross-section (σ), and the average speed of the molecules. In this scenario, Mike initially measures the mean free path of gas molecules in the ultra-high vacuum chamber as λ1. However, upon turning on the electron beam, he observes a change to λ2. The temperature remains constant, so thermal effects are ruled out as a direct cause.

When the electron beam is active, high-energy electrons interact with the gas molecules, introducing additional factors that affect the mean free path. These interactions include electron-gas molecule collisions, which were not present when the beam was off. These collisions increase the frequency of interactions experienced by the gas molecules, effectively reducing the average distance they travel before a collision. Additionally, the electron beam may ionize some gas molecules, altering their properties (e.g., charge or cross-sectional area), which could further reduce the mean free path.

The original mean free path, λ1, was calculated based solely on gas-gas molecule collisions. With the electron beam on, gas molecules now collide not only with each other but also with electrons, leading to a shorter mean free path, λ2. Since the number density (n) remains unchanged and the temperature is constant, the reduction in λ is primarily due to the increased collision frequency and potential changes in the collision cross-section (σ) caused by interactions with the electron beam.

Thus, the observed mean free path λ2 is shorter than λ1, leading to the conclusion that λ2 < λ1.
