Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this science question. Let's break it down step by step. The question is about a genetic construct and why a fluorescent signal isn't showing up as expected.

First, the setup: They have a new ligand-receptor pair that's initially expressed in neural crest cells. The goal is to study their developmental fate. 

The receptor is a monomeric transmembrane protein with eight alpha helices, four extracellular helices, and three beta sheets. The ligand is a coiled-coil made of two alpha helices. So, the ligand probably interacts with the extracellular part of the receptor.

They created a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. Bicistronic means two genes in one construct. The ligand's ORF is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry. The receptor is at 3', fused to eGFP at the C-terminus. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, and the receptor has an IRES upstream. 

Between ligand and mCherry, there's a stop in a loxP-stop-loxP cassette. Similarly, between receptor and eGFP, a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette. So, these are stop signals that can be removed by Cre recombination.

They made a mouse model homozygous for the construct in the wild-type background. Then crossed to SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice. SOX10 is a transcription factor important in neural crest development. Cre would be expressed under SOX10's control, I think, so it would activate in neural crest cells.

After the offspring are born, they visualize under a confocal. They don't see a green signal. So, the eGFP isn't being expressed, or the construct isn't working.

The options are A to D. Let's think about each.

Option A: Ligand and receptor in a paracrine relationship. Paracrine means they act on nearby cells. But the question is about expression in the same cells? The vector is bicistronic, meaning both ligand and receptor are expressed in the same cell. If they were paracrine, maybe ligand is secreted and acts elsewhere. But the construct is in the same cell, so probably autocrine. Not sure how this relates to the lack of GFP.

Option B: Receptor-eGFP stuck in Golgi. eGFP is a reporter. If it's stuck, maybe it doesn't get to the cell surface. But the question says the construct is transfected into primary astrocytes. Wait, but in the mice, they're using SOX10-Cre. SOX10 is expressed in neural crest, which gives rise to various cells, including astrocytes. So the Cre would excise the stop cassettes in neural crest-derived cells, including perhaps astrocytes, so the ligand and receptor should be expressed.

But if the receptor-eGFP is stuck in the Golgi, the GFP might not be on the cell surface, so you wouldn't detect it. But the western blot might show it. Wait, the question says after transfection into astrocytes, they did a Western blot and saw signals proportional to actin loading. So the proteins are being expressed. So the issue isn't expression, but maybe whether they're correctly tagged or processed.

Wait, the vector uses stop cassettes. When Cre is present, it recombines the lox sites, removing the stop, so the ORFs are expressed. So without Cre, the stop remains, so no expression.

But in the mouse, they're homozygous for the construct, and crossed to SOX10-Cre. So in the offspring, the Cre would excise the stops in SOX10-expressing cells, meaning the ligand and receptor should be expressed there.

But in the experiment, they don't see green. So why isn't the eGFP expressed?

Option C: Missing enhancer. The ligand is under CBA promoter. CBA is a strong promoter, so maybe it's constitutive. The receptor uses an IRES, which is a weaker element, but IRES allows internal ribosome entry, so it might be expressed at lower levels. But the presence of the CBA promoter should drive ligand expression. If the enhancer is missing, perhaps the expression isn't happening. But in the Western blot, they saw the proteins were expressed. So maybe the enhancer isn't needed for in vitro expression, but in vivo it is? Or perhaps the CBA is sufficient. Not sure. 

Option D: Receptor and eGFP not in frame. The stop cassettes are between them. So the stop is in the loxP cassette. When Cre removes the stop, the receptor ORF is connected to eGFP. If the frame is correct, it'll be a fusion protein. If not, the eGFP would be expressed as a separate protein only if the stop is removed. Wait, no. If the stop is between the receptor and eGFP, and it's a lox2272 cassette, then when Cre cuts, the stop is removed, and the receptor is followed by eGFP. So if the reading frame is correct, the eGFP would be at the C-terminus of the receptor. If not, then the eGFP might not be expressed, or the receptor might be messed up.

But the question says that the antibodies were raised against the overexpressed proteins. So when they did the western, they saw signals. So the proteins are expressed. Which suggests that the frame is correct. Because if it was a frame shift, eGFP might not be expressed, but the receptor might not be either, or maybe the antibodies wouldn't work. Hmm.

Wait, in the Western blot, proteins are detected. So the proteins (ligand and receptor) are being expressed. So the stop cassettes are correctly removed in the cells where Cre is active, which should be the neural crest-derived cells.

But why no green signal? So the eGFP isn't being expressed. But the western blot shows the receptor is expressed. How?

Wait, the eGFP is at the C-terminus of the receptor. If the stop is removed, the receptor is expressed along with eGFP. So if the eGFP isn't visible, perhaps the fusion is not happening correctly. Or perhaps the eGFP is retained in the cell, not secreted or not on the surface.

But in the confocal, they're looking for fluorescence, which suggests it's on the cell surface. If the receptor is on the cell surface, eGFP would be as well.

Another possibility: the eGFP is not being expressed because the stop is still in place. But the Cre should remove the stop. Unless the Cre isn't active, perhaps. But the mouse is crossed with SOX10-Cre, so in neural crest cells, SOX10 is expressed, which should activate Cre.

Wait, but in the question, the mouse is homozygous for the construct, and crossed with SOX10-Cre hemizygous. So the offspring would have the construct and the Cre. So Cre should excise the stops.

But the Western blot is done on transfectantsâ€”maybe that's in vitro. When they transfected the plasmid into primary astrocytes, the expression was checked. So the vector would be in the cells, but perhaps in vitro, without Cre, the stops are in place, so the proteins are not expressed. But they did the western and saw signals. So that suggests that in the transfected cells, the stop cassettes were removed, which would only happen if Cre was present. Wait, but in the question, the vector is a lox-Cre vector, so perhaps the plasmid contains a Cre under a promoter?

Wait, the setup says they transfected the plasmid into primary astrocytes, then did a western blot. So the plasmid must have Cre to excise the stops, otherwise the proteins wouldn't be expressed. Unless the vector has a constitutive Cre expression. Or perhaps the vector is a lentivirus or something with Cre. Or maybe the construct uses a different system.

Alternatively, perhaps the vector uses a dual-lox system. LoxP and lox2272 are different recognition sites for Cre. So for the ligand ORF, the stop is in a loxP cassette. So to remove it, a Cre that recognizes loxP is needed. The receptor's stop is in lox2272 cassette, which requires a different Cre (maybe lox2272 is a variant that requires Cre with a mutation, like Dre or another recombinase, but I'm not sure).

Wait, loxP is the standard site, and lox2272 is a variant that is recognized by Cre but with higher specificity. So the same Cre can cut both. So in the vector, the ligand is followed by a stop in loxP, and the receptor is followed by a stop in lox2272. So when Cre is introduced, both stops are removed, allowing both ligand and receptor to be expressed.

But in the mouse, the SOX10-Cre would provide Cre, which would excise both stops. So in cells where SOX10 is expressed, the ligand and receptor should be expressed.

But when the mouse is crossed, the offspring would have the construct, and Cre would be active in neural crest cells. So why no green signal?

Wait, the western blot was done after transfection, but when they crossed the mice, perhaps the expression is only in the neural crest-derived cells. But in the initial experiment, the transfected cells (astrocytes) showed proteins. But when the mouse is made, perhaps the expression is in a different cell type.

Wait, the problem says that the mouse is homozygous for the construct in the wt background. Then they crossed it to SOX10-Cre. So the mouse itself has the construct, and the Cre is from the SOX10-Cre line. SOX10 is expressed in the neural crest, which gives rise to various cell types, including astrocytes. So in the offspring, in the neural crest-derived cells, including the astrocytes, Cre should be active, excising the stops, allowing both ligand and receptor to be expressed.

But when they looked under the confocal, they didn't see green. So why?

Let me think about the possible issues. Perhaps the eGFP isn't being expressed because the construct didn't get into the cells, or it's not functional.

Alternatively, the issue could be with the vector design. The ligand is at 5' with mCherry, and the receptor is at 3' with eGFP. The ligand is under CBA, which is a strong promoter. The receptor is under IRES, which is weaker. So perhaps the receptor isn't being expressed as much, leading to no eGFP signal.

But the Western blot showed both proteins were expressed, so the issue isn't their expression.

Wait, no. The vector has the ligand ORF under CBA, so it's expressed. The receptor is after an IRES, which is a weaker element but allows expression without the need for a separate promoter. So the CBA promoter would drive the ligand, and the IRES would drive the receptor.

But when the stops are removed, the ligand is fused to mCherry, and the receptor is fused to eGFP. So mCherry would be expressed as a separate protein if the stop is removed? No, because the stop is between the ligand and mCherry. So the ligand and mCherry would be separate ORFs. Oh, wait, the ligand ORF is 5', followed by a stop, then mCherry. So without Cre, the ligand can't be expressed because the stop is in between. But when Cre cuts, the stop is removed, so ligand ORF is connected to mCherry.

Wait, no, the way it's described is: ligand ORF at 5' fused to mCherry, but with a stop in a loxP cassette between them. So the construct is: CBA promoter -> ligand ORF -> stop (loxP) -> mCherry. So without Cre, the ligand is expressed, but the stop is in the way, so mCherry isn't. When Cre removes the stop, ligand and mCherry are in frame? Or is it that the ligand is expressed, then a stop, then mCherry. So when the stop is removed, the ligand and mCherry are in the same ORF? That doesn't make sense unless they're in frame.

Wait, perhaps the ligand and mCherry are on separate transcripts. Wait, no, bicistronic means two ORFs in one transcript, each with their own RBS. But with the stops in between, perhaps the IRES is involved. Wait, the ligand is under CBA, and the receptor is under IRES. So the transcript is: CBA -> ligand -> IRES -> receptor.

Wait, no. The question says the ligand is under CBA, and upstream of the receptor is the IRES. So the transcript starts with CBA, driving the ligand, then the IRES, then the receptor. So the two ORFs are in the same transcript, with the IRES allowing the receptor to be translated.

But the stops are between the ligand and mCherry, and the receptor and eGFP. So ligand is followed by a stop, then mCherry, but the stop is part of a loxP cassette. So without Cre, ligand is expressed, then a stop, then mCherry is not. So when Cre excises the loxP stop, the ligand is fused to mCherry? Or ligand and mCherry are in the same ORF.

Wait, maybe not. Let me think: the vector is bicistronic, with the ligand first, then the receptor. Each has their own RBS and ORF.

So the arrangement is:

5' CBA promoter -> ligand ORF -> (loxP-stop-loxP) -> mCherry ORF -> IRES -> receptor ORF -> (lox2272-stop-lox2272) -> eGFP ORF.

Wait, no, that can't be. Because the IRES would come after the ligand. Or perhaps the IRES is between the ligand and receptor.

Wait, the question says: the ligand is under the CBA promoter, and upstream of the receptor is the IRES. So the arrangement is CBA -> ligand ORF -> IRES -> receptor ORF. Then, between ligand and mCherry, there's a stop in a loxP cassette. So the ligand is followed by a stop, then mCherry. But that might be in a separate part.

Alternatively, perhaps the vector is designed as CBA promoter -> ligand ORF with a stop cassette, then mCherry, then IRES, then receptor ORF with another stop cassette, then eGFP.

Wait, perhaps the vector is such that the ligand and mCherry are in one transcript, and the receptor and eGFP are in another, but that doesn't make sense with bicistronic.

Alternatively, the ligand is expressed from the CBA promoter, then the stop, then mCherry. So without Cre, ligand is expressed, but mCherry is not. With Cre, the stop is removed, allowing mCherry to be co-expressed with ligand.

Similarly, the receptor is under the IRES, followed by a stop, then eGFP. When Cre removes the stop, eGFP is expressed with the receptor.

But wait, the IRES is a ribosome entry site, so the receptor would be expressed after the ligand.

But the problem is that the mouse model has the construct. When they cross to SOX10-Cre, Cre should remove both stop cassettes. So in the offspring, the ligand and mCherry should be expressed, and the receptor and eGFP should be expressed.

But in the confocal, they don't see green. So eGFP isn't expressed. Why?

Possible issues:

1. The eGFP is not being translated. If the stop between receptor and eGFP wasn't removed, then eGFP wouldn't be expressed. But the Cre should have removed it.

But in the Western blot, they saw the proteins were expressed. So the receptor is expressed, which means the stop was removed. So eGFP should also be expressed.

Wait, but Western blot shows the proteins. The eGFP is a small protein, so maybe it's not detected, but the receptor would be larger. So perhaps the eGFP isn't being expressed, but the receptor is. But the question says the total proteins give a signal proportional to actin, so the loading is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the eGFP is not being expressed because the frame is wrong between receptor and eGFP. So, the stop is in the lox2272 cassette, which is between receptor and eGFP. When Cre removes the stop, if the reading frame is not correct, the eGFP might not be expressed. But if the frame is correct, the eGFP would be a C-terminal fusion with the receptor.

Wait, but eGFP is a separate ORF. So if the stop is removed, the receptor's ORF continues into eGFP. That would mean that eGFP is part of the same protein as the receptor, which is not the case. Because the question says the eGFP is fused to the C-terminus of the receptor. So perhaps the ORF is designed so that after the receptor, eGFP is in frame. So when the stop is removed, the receptor-eGFP fusion is expressed.

If the frame is wrong, the eGFP wouldn't be expressed, and the receptor might be truncated or non-functional. But the western blot indicated that the receptor is expressed. So the frame must be correct. So why no eGFP?

Hmm. Another possibility: the eGFP is not being properly trafficked to the cell surface. But in the western blot, the total proteins are detected, so the eGFP is being produced, but perhaps not on the surface. But in the confocal, they look for surface expression. So if the receptor-eGFP is retained in the ER or Golgi, the eGFP wouldn't be on the surface, so the confocal wouldn't detect it.

But the question says the receptor is a transmembrane protein, so it should be on the cell surface. If the eGFP is on the same protein, it should be as well.

So why would the receptor be expressed but the eGFP not show up? Maybe the eGFP isn't properly folded, or it's in an intracellular compartment.

Wait, but the Western blot uses total proteins, so the eGFP would still be detected, just not on the surface. But the question says in the confocal, they don't see a green signal. So if the eGFP is in the cytoplasm, maybe they don't see it because it's not fluorescent. But eGFP is a fluorescent protein; it should fluoresce when exposed to blue light, regardless of location. Unless it's not being expressed.

Wait, another thought: the eGFP fusion is not functional, but the eGFP itself isn't expressed as a separate protein. So for the confocal, they might be looking for eGFP fluorescence, which would come from cells expressing the receptor-eGFP fusion. If the fusion is not expressed, perhaps the eGFP isn't either.

But the western blot showed the receptor, so the eGFP must be expressed as part of the fusion.

Alternatively, perhaps the eGFP is not properly processed. Like, the fusion is causing the eGFP to be misfolded, so it doesn't fluoresce. But I think the question wouldn't hinge on that technicality.

Wait, looking at the options again, option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. If they're not in frame, then when the stop is removed, the eGFP isn't translated, but the receptor's ORF continues into eGFP's sequence, leading to a truncated or nonfunctional protein.

But the western blot shows the receptor is expressed. If the frame is incorrect, the receptor might not be expressed properly because the reading frame shifts. So perhaps the eGFP isn't expressed, but the receptor is. But the western blot detected the receptor, so maybe the frame is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the eGFP is expressed, but the antibodies don't detect it because it's a small protein. Wait, the question says they raised antibodies against the overexpressed proteins. So if the eGFP is a separate tag, maybe the antibody is against the receptor, not eGFP.

Wait, the western blot uses total proteins. So if the eGFP is expressed, it would show as a band. But the problem says that the signal is proportional to actin, which suggests that the loading is correct. So perhaps the eGFP isn't being expressed, which would mean the stop wasn't removed. But why?

Wait, the vector uses loxP and lox2272 cassettes. Lox2272 requires a different Cre variant, perhaps? Or maybe the loxP and lox2272 are arranged in a way that Cre can't excise both.

Wait, in the ligand's case, the stop is in a loxP cassette. The receptor's stop is in a lox2272 cassette. The same Cre can recognize both, so both should be excised. But maybe the Cre isn't active in the cells, or isn't present. But the mouse was crossed with SOX10-Cre, so Cre should be active in neural crest cells.

Another possibility is that the vector has a stop in the loxP cassette for the ligand and mCherry, and a stop in the lox2272 for the receptor and eGFP. So, for both to be expressed, both stops must be removed. If one stop remains, the other might not be expressed.

But if the SOX10-Cre only excises one of the stops, then maybe only the ligand and mCherry are expressed, but not the receptor and eGFP. So in that case, the eGFP wouldn't be expressed.

But why would SOX10-Cre only excise one stop? No, Cre recognizes both loxP and lox2272 sites. So both stops should be removed.

Wait, perhaps the vector has the ligand and mCherry in one transcript, and the receptor and eGFP in another. Or maybe the lox sites are arranged such that Cre only excises one.

Wait, perhaps the vector is designed with the ligand in the first cassette and the receptor in the second. The loxP-stop-loxP is before mCherry, and lox2272-stop-lox2272 is before eGFP. So when Cre is added, both stops are removed, allowing both mCherry and eGFP to be expressed. But in the mouse, if the Cre is only able to excise one, perhaps only one tag is expressed.

But I don't see how that would happen. Both loxP and lox2272 are Cre sites. So if Cre is active, both stops should be cut.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the eGFP is not being expressed because the IRES is not working. The receptor is under the IRES, so without the IRES being functional, the receptor wouldn't be expressed. But the western blot shows the receptor is expressed, so that can't be.

Wait, another angle: the vector was transfected into astrocytes, and the western blot confirmed expression. But in the mouse, the same construct is in the genome, but maybe the expression is under different promoters. Or perhaps the CBA promoter isn't active in the cells where the mouse is being examined.

Wait, the CBA promoter is a strong, constitutive promoter. It should drive expression in most cells. So if the ligand is expressed, but the receptor isn't, then the eGFP wouldn't be expressed. But the western blot showed both proteins are expressed when transfected into astrocytes. So the problem must be in the mouse model.

Wait, but the mouse is homozygous for the construct. So the expression should occur in cells where Cre is active, which is the neural crest-derived cells, including astrocytes.

Wait, perhaps the eGFP is not being correctly spliced or something. But that's more of an RNA processing issue.

Another angle: the vector uses a bicistronic design with two different stop cassettes. But perhaps the way it's set up, the eGFP isn't being translated because the reading frame is wrong. So the receptor is expressed, but the eGFP isn't, leading to no green signal.

But the western blot would show the eGFP as part of the receptor? Or as a separate band? If eGFP is part of the receptor, maybe the western blot for the receptor detects the larger protein, but the eGFP isn't visible as a separate band.

Wait, the question says that the antibodies were raised against the overexpressed proteins. So perhaps the antibodies are against the ligand and receptor. The eGFP is a separate tag, but they're not using it for detection in the Western. So the Western blot shows the presence of the receptor, but not eGFP. So the eGFP might not be expressed, but why?

If the eGFP isn't expressed, perhaps the stop wasn't removed. But why?

Wait, considering option D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. If the stop is removed but the ORFs are not in frame, the eGFP's ORF is disrupted, so it isn't expressed. But the receptor's ORF is intact, so it's expressed. Thus, the western blot shows the receptor, but eGFP isn't expressed.

But would the frame being incorrect prevent the eGFP from being expressed? Yes, because the stop is removed, but the reading frame is wrong, so the eGFP isn't translated. So the eGFP isn't expressed, but the receptor is. So in the confocal, no green because eGFP isn't present.

But the question says the answer is one of the options. So which option matches this scenario.

Option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in the frame. So when the stop is removed, the eGFP isn't expressed because the frame is wrong, so no green signal. That would explain why the western blot shows the receptor but not eGFP.

Alternatively, perhaps the frame is correct, but the eGFP isn't being expressed because it's fused to the receptor. But then the confocal would detect it if it's on the surface.

Wait, but the eGFP is at the C-terminus of the receptor. So if the receptor is on the cell surface, the eGFP would be as well. So why no green?

If the eGFP is properly expressed and on the surface, the confocal would see it. So if the green isn't seen, perhaps the eGFP isn't expressed.

So the only option that makes sense is D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame, so eGFP isn't expressed. So when the stop is removed, the eGFP's ORF is not correctly aligned, so it isn't expressed, while the receptor is.

Therefore, the correct answer is D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves a bicistronic lox-Cre vector expressing a ligand and receptor pair, with mCherry fused to the ligand and eGFP fused to the receptor. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, and the receptor is under an IRES regulatory element. Stop cassettes (loxP-stop-loxP and lox2272-stop-lox2272) are positioned between the ligand and mCherry, and between the receptor and eGFP, respectively. The construct was introduced into a mouse model homozygous for the construct, crossed with SOX10-Cre mice, and visualization under confocal microscopy failed to detect a green signal (eGFP). The goal is to determine the most likely reason for the lack of eGFP expression.

### Key Analysis of the Options:

1. **Option A: Ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship**  
   This is unlikely because the vector is bicistronic, meaning both the ligand and receptor are expressed in the same cell. A paracrine relationship would imply the ligand acts on a different cell, but the construct design suggests autocrine signaling. Additionally, the lack of eGFP expression is not explained by this option.

2. **Option B: The receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi**  
   If the receptor-eGFP fusion were retained in the Golgi, eGFP would not be on the cell surface, and fluorescence would not be detected. However, the Western blot shows that the receptor is expressed, indicating that the construct is being properly trafficked and processed. This makes this option less likely.

3. **Option C: The enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing**  
   The ligand is under the CBA promoter, which is a strong, constitutive promoter, and the receptor is under an IRES, which allows for translation. The Western blot confirms that both proteins are expressed, indicating that the enhancer is not the limiting factor. Thus, this option is unlikely.

4. **Option D: The receptor and eGFP are not in the frame**  
   The stop cassette between the receptor and eGFP is under a lox2272 site. If the stop is removed by Cre but the receptor and eGFP are not in the correct reading frame, the eGFP ORF would not be properly translated. This would result in the receptor being expressed (as confirmed by the Western blot) while eGFP remains unexpressed. This explains the lack of green fluorescence in the confocal microscopy.

### Conclusion:
The most likely explanation is that the receptor and eGFP are not in the correct reading frame, preventing eGFP expression while allowing the receptor to be expressed. This aligns with the experimental observations and the design of the construct.

**Answer: D**
