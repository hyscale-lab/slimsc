Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric fields and conductors. Hmm, let's see. I need to figure out the electric field at a point outside the conductor. The setup is a bit tricky with a cavity inside.

Alright, the problem says there's an uncharged spherical conductor. It has a small cavity inside, and the center of the cavity is a distance s away from the center of the conductor. The cavity's radius is r, which is smaller than R, the conductor's radius. So the cavity is off-center.

Then, they placed a small positive charge +q inside the cavity. I need to find the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is at a distance L from the conductor's center, and l is its distance from the cavity's center. Also, the angle between l and s is theta. Both l and L are greater than R, so P is definitely outside.

Wait, I remember something about conductors and charges. When a conductor is neutral, and you place a charge inside a cavity, the conductor's inner surface must adjust. Oh right, the method of images. The inner surface of the conductor will induce an equal and opposite charge, but wait, the conductor was uncharged. So the total charge on the conductor is zero. Hmm, that's important.

So, when +q is placed inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor must have an induced charge of -q. Because the conductor was initially neutral. But wait, wait, the cavity isn't centered, so the induced charge distribution might not be symmetric. But wait, for the electric field outside the conductor, the charges on the outer surface might matter more.

Wait, no. The conductor's outer surface: since the conductor is neutral overall, the inner surface has -q, so the outer surface must have +q to balance, but wait, the total conductor charge is zero. Oh wait no, the conductor was uncharged before. So the total charge is zero. So the inner surface has -q, and the outer surface must have +q? Because the total conductor's charge is zero, so inner surface (-q) plus outer surface (+q) gives zero. Wait, but in reality, when a charge is placed in a cavity, the inner surface would have an induced charge opposite to the enclosed charge, and the outer surface must have the same as the conductor's total charge. Oh, but the conductor was uncharged, so the outer surface would have zero charge. Wait, no, that can't be right.

Wait no, I think I'm mixing things up. Let me think again. The conductor is neutral. When you place +q inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor must have an induced charge of -q, because the conductor's material will redistribute charges to cancel the electric field inside the conductor. But since the conductor is neutral, the outer surface must have +q, so that the total is (-q) + (+q) = 0. So yes, the outer surface would have +q, and the inner surface -q.

But wait, no, because the conductor was uncharged initially. So the conductor's total charge is zero. The inner surface is induced with -q, so the outer surface must be +q to make the total zero? Because the whole conductor's charge is sum of inner and outer. So yes, that makes sense.

But wait, in reality, the conductor's outer surface will have a charge that depends on any external fields or other charges. Oh, but in this case, the conductor is isolated, so the charges on the inner and outer surfaces must sum to zero. So yes, the outer surface is +q.

But wait, no. Wait, the conductor is neutral. So when you put +q in the cavity, the inner surface must have -q, and the outer surface must have +q, so that the total conductor remains neutral. That makes sense.

So the outer surface has +q. But wait, no, wait, no. The inner surface's induced charge is -q, because the induced charges are due to the enclosed charge. The conductor's total charge is zero, so the outer surface must have +q to balance the inner's -q. Yes, that makes sense.

Wait, but wait a second. The conductor is neutral, so the total charge is zero. The inner surface has -q, so the outer surface must be +q. So the outer surface has +q. So when considering the electric field outside the conductor, the field is as if all the charge were at the center? Or wait, no. Because the outer surface has +q, so the field outside the conductor is the same as if the charge +q were located at the center of the conductor.

Wait, but wait, no. The field outside a charged conductor is determined by the total charge on the outer surface. So the field outside is as if all the charge is concentrated at the center. So in this case, the outer surface has +q, so E outside is (1/(4πε₀)) * q / r², where r is the distance from the center.

But wait, point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor. So the electric field at P would be as if the charge +q is at the center of the conductor. So the field is q/(4πε₀ L²) directed radially outward.

Wait, but the options don't have that. Let me look.

Option B is (1/(4πε₀)) q / L². That's exactly what I thought. So why is that? Because the outer surface has +q, and the field outside is as if the charge were at the center.

But wait, the charge q is inside an off-center cavity. Does that affect the field outside? Hmm. Because the inner surface's charge distribution is -q, but the outer surface's charge is +q.

Wait, but the conductor's outer surface, in this case, will have a uniform distribution if the conductor is a perfect sphere, but wait, the conductor is a sphere with a cavity, but the charge +q is placed inside the cavity, which is off-center.

But regardless, the conductor's outer surface will have +q. But wait, because the conductor is a sphere, the outer surface charge will distribute uniformly only if the charge inside is symmetric. But in this case, the charge is in an off-center cavity. So would the outer surface's charge distribution be uniform?

Wait, no. Because the cavity is off-center, the inner surface's charge distribution would be non-uniform. But for the conductor as a whole, the outer surface's charge distribution would adjust such that the electric field inside the conductor is zero. So the outer surface's charge would not necessarily be uniformly distributed if the inner surface isn't symmetric.

Wait, but the conductor is a sphere. So even if the inner surface's charge distribution is non-uniform, the outer surface's charge would arrange itself to make the electric field inside the conductor zero. But what about the electric field outside?

Wait, here's a concept I remember: the electric field outside a conductor depends only on the total charge on the outer surface, and it's as if that charge were concentrated at the center. So regardless of the inner structure, the external field is determined by the total outer charge. So in this case, the outer surface has +q, so the external field is as if +q is at the center.

So the distance from the center of the conductor to point P is L, so the field E is (1/(4πε₀)) (q)/(L²) radially outward. So looking at the options:

Option B is E= (1/(4πε₀)) q / L². That's exactly the case. So the answer should be B.

Wait, but let me check the other options. Option D is (1/(4πε₀)) q / l². That would be the case if the charge were at a distance l from P, but l is the distance from P to the center of the cavity, not to the center of the conductor. So that's probably incorrect.

Option A and C are about l and s and cos(theta). But if the field outside depends only on the total charge on the conductor's outer surface, which is +q, and the distance L from the center, those terms shouldn't matter. So the answer is B.

To determine the electric field $\vec{E}$ at a point $P$ outside the spherical conductor, we analyze the system as follows:

1. **Setup and Induced Charges**: The spherical conductor is initially neutral. When a charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor induces a charge $-q$ to cancel the electric field within the conductor. Since the conductor is neutral overall, the outer surface must have a charge $+q$ to balance the $-q$ on the inner surface.

2. **Electric Field Outside the Conductor**: The electric field outside a charged spherical conductor depends only on the total charge on its outer surface and is as if the charge were concentrated at the center of the conductor. This is due to the symmetry of the conductor and the fact that the field inside the conductor is zero.

3. **Distance and Field Calculation**: The point $P$ is located at a distance $L$ from the center of the conductor. Since the outer surface has a total charge $+q$, the electric field at $P$ is:
   \[
   E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}
   \]
   This matches the form given in **Option B**.

4. **Analysis of Other Options**:
   - **Option A** and **Option C** involve terms like $(l \pm s \cos\theta)^2$, which are irrelevant because the electric field outside the conductor depends only on the total charge on the outer surface and the distance $L$ from the center, not on the specific geometry of the cavity or the angle $\theta$.
   - **Option D** assumes the field depends on $l^2$, where $l$ is the distance from $P$ to the center of the cavity. However, the field outside the conductor is determined by the outer surface charge, not the position of the cavity or the charge inside it.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: B**
