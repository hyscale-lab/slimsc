Okay, I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem. Let's read through it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

So, the problem states that we have an electron in a state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. The |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator, which I think is the standard spin-up and spin-down states along the z-axis.

Then, the question asks us to calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of an operator whose matrix representation has elements Aij = ħ/2 if i≠j and 0 otherwise. Also, we need to find the average value of that operator.

Hmm, okay. Let me break this down into steps.

First, I need to normalize the state |alpha>, because it's given as proportional, not necessarily unit length.

The state is |alpha> = (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. Let me write this in vector form. The spin-up and spin-down states form an orthonormal basis. So |up> corresponds to (1,0) and |down> corresponds to (0,1) in a two-dimensional vector space.

So, the vector representation of |alpha> is [1+i, 2-i]^T.

The norm squared is the sum of the absolute squares of the components. So, |1+i|^2 is (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2. Similarly, |2-i|^2 is (2)^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 +1=5. So the total norm squared is 2+5=7. Therefore, the normalized state is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2-i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

Next, the operator in question has a matrix where the diagonal elements are zero, and the off-diagonal elements are ħ/2. So the matrix A is:

[ 0    ħ/2 ]
[ ħ/2  0   ]

Wait, that's correct because A_ij is ħ/2 when i≠j, and 0 otherwise. So it's a 2x2 matrix with zeros on the diagonal and ħ/2 elsewhere.

This operator looks like a spin operator in the x or y direction? Because the Pauli matrices have that structure. Wait, the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], and the Pauli Y matrix is [[0,-i],[i,0]]. So A is proportional to the Pauli X matrix, but scaled by ħ/2.

Wait, our matrix A is (ħ/2) times the Pauli X matrix, because each element is (ħ/2) where the Pauli X has 1. So A = (ħ/2) σ_x.

Wait, but actually, the Pauli matrices are defined as σ_x = [[0,1],[1,0]], σ_y = [[0,-i],[i,0]], σ_z = [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So yes, A is (ħ/2) σ_x.

So, the eigenstates of this operator are the eigenstates of σ_x, which are the spin eigenstates along the x-axis.

In the computational basis (z-basis), the eigenstates |+x> and |-x> can be written as superpositions of |up> and |down>.

The eigenstates of σ_x are |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and |-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), right? Because σ_x |+x> = (+1)|+x>, etc.

But wait, in our case, the operator is (ħ/2) σ_x, so the eigenvalues would be (ħ/2) * 1 and (ħ/2)*(-1), which are ħ/2 and -ħ/2.

But the problem is asking for the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of operator A. So, we need to express |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of A, which are |+x> and |-x>, and then find the probabilities.

Wait, but I think I can approach this in another way. Since A is a Hermitian operator, its eigenstates form a basis. So, to find the probability of measuring a particular eigenvalue, we can project |alpha> onto each eigenstate.

Alternatively, since A is (ħ/2) σ_x, perhaps it's easier to compute the expectation value and the probabilities by working with the σ_x matrix.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about the eigenbasis.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to find the coefficients when expanding |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |-x>. The squared magnitudes of these coefficients will give the probabilities.

So, let's compute the inner products of |alpha> with |+x> and with |-x>.

First, let's write |+x> and |-x> in terms of |up> and |down>.

|+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2)
|-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2)

Our state |alpha> is [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ] |up> + [ (2 - i)/sqrt(7) ] |down>.

So, the inner product with |+x> is:

< +x | alpha > = (1/sqrt(2)) [ < up | alpha > + < down | alpha > ]

Similarly, < -x | alpha > = (1/sqrt(2)) [ < up | alpha > - < down | alpha > ]

Wait, let me compute these.

First, compute < up | alpha >: (1+i)/sqrt(7)
< down | alpha >: (2 - i)/sqrt(7)

So,

< +x | alpha > = (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) + (2 - i)/sqrt(7) ) ]

= (1/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(7))) [ (1+i) + (2 -i) ]
= (1/(sqrt(14))) [ 3 + 0i ]
= 3 / sqrt(14)

Similarly,

< -x | alpha > = (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) - (2 - i)/sqrt(7) ) ]

= (1/(sqrt(14))) [ (1+i) - (2 - i) ]
= (1/(sqrt(14))) [ (1 -2) + (i +i) ]
= (1/(sqrt(14))) [ (-1) + 2i ]
= (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14)

So, the probabilities are the squared magnitudes of these inner products.

Compute |3/sqrt(14)|^2 = (9)/(14) ≈ 0.642857. So that's about 0.643, but looking at the options, option A has 0.64 and 0.36, which sum to 1, as 0.64+0.36=1. So that's a possibility.

Wait, the other probability is |(-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14)|^2.

Calculating that:

The numerator is (-1)^2 + (2)^2 = 1 +4=5. So the magnitude squared is 5/(14) ≈ 0.3571. Hmm, but 0.64 and 0.36 sum to 1.00, whereas 9/14 is approximately 0.6429 and 5/14 is approximately 0.3571. So the probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14.

Wait, but 9/14 is about 0.6429, which is approximately 0.64. So that would match option A's first probability. The second probability would be 5/14≈0.357, but option A has 0.36.

Wait, but 5/14 is approximately 0.357, which is ~0.357, which is close to 0.36. So perhaps the problem is approximating. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the inner products.

Wait, let me recheck the calculations.

First, < +x | alpha >:

(1+i)/sqrt(7) + (2 - i)/sqrt(7) = [ (1+i) + (2 -i) ] / sqrt(7)
= (3 + 0i) / sqrt(7)
Multiply by 1/sqrt(2), so overall (3) / (sqrt(7)*sqrt(2)) )= 3/sqrt(14)
The magnitude squared is (3)^2 / (14) = 9/14 ≈0.642857.

Similarly, < -x | alpha >:

(1+i) - (2 - i) = (1-2) + (i + i) )= (-1) + 2i.
So the numerator is (-1 +2i). Its magnitude squared is (-1)^2 + (2)^2=1 +4=5.

So the inner product is (-1 +2i)/sqrt(14), so magnitude squared is 5/14 ≈0.3571.

So the probabilities are 9/14 ≈0.6429 and 5/14≈0.3571.

Looking at the options, option A says 0.64 and 0.36, which sum to 1. So that's a match.

But wait, the question also asks for the average value of the operator.

The average value <A> is the expectation value of operator A in state |alpha>.

Since A is (ħ/2) σ_x, the expectation value is (ħ/2) times the expectation value of σ_x in |alpha>.

What's the expectation value of σ_x for a state |psi>?

σ_x = [[0,1],[1,0]], so the expectation value is <psi| σ_x |psi>.

Alternatively, for a state |psi> = a|up> + b|down>, the expectation value is 2 Re(ab*). Because:

<σ_x> = |a|^2 <up|σ_x|up> + a b* <up|σ_x|down> + a* b <down|σ_x|up> + |b|^2 <down|σ_x|down>

But σ_x |up> = |down> and σ_x |down> = |up>.

So <up|σ_x|up> = 0, <down|σ_x|down> =0.

So <σ_x> = a b* + a* b.

Which is 2 Re(a b*).

But a here is (1+i)/sqrt(7), and b is (2 -i)/sqrt(7).

So a b* = [(1+i)/sqrt(7)] * [(2 +i)/sqrt(7)] = (1+i)(2+i)/(7)

Compute (1+i)(2+i) = 1*2 +1*i +i*2 +i*i = 2 +i +2i +i^2 = 2+3i -1 = 1+3i.

So a b* = (1+3i)/7.

The real part of a b* is 1/7.

So 2 Re(a b*) = 2*(1/7) = 2/7.

So <σ_x> = 2/7.

Therefore, <A> = (ħ/2) * (2/7) ) = ħ/7.

So the average value is ħ/7.

Looking at the options:

Option A says average value hbar /7. So that matches.

So the probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, and the average is hbar/7.

So the correct option is A.

Wait, but let me look at the options again.

Option A) 0.64, 0.36 and hbar /7.

Yes, that's what we got.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the expectation value. Another approach is to compute <A> directly.

The matrix A is [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]].

The state |alpha> is [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ]^T.

The expectation value is the conjugate transpose multiplied by A multiplied by the state.

So, compute <alpha| A |alpha>.

Compute:

[ (1-i)/sqrt(7), (2 +i)/sqrt(7) ] * A * [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ].

Multiplying it out:

First, compute A |alpha>:

A |alpha> = [ (ħ/2)*(2 -i)/sqrt(7), (ħ/2)*(1+i)/sqrt(7) ]^T.

Then, <alpha| A |alpha> is the dot product of <alpha| and A |alpha>.

So,

( (1 -i)/sqrt(7) ) * ( ħ/2 (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ) ) + ( (2 +i)/sqrt(7) ) * ( ħ/2 (1 +i)/sqrt(7) ) )

Factor out (ħ/2)/7:

= (ħ/2 *1/7) [ (1-i)(2 -i) + (2 +i)(1 +i) ]

Compute each term.

First term: (1-i)(2-i) = 1*2 + 1*(-i) + (-i)*2 + (-i)*(-i)
= 2 -i -2i + i^2
= 2 -3i -1 (since i^2 = -1)
= 1 -3i.

Second term: (2 +i)(1 +i) = 2*1 + 2*i +i*1 +i*i
= 2 +2i +i + i^2
= 2 +3i -1
= 1 +3i.

Adding the two terms: (1-3i) + (1+3i) ) = 2.

So, <A> = (ħ/2 * 1/7) * 2 = (ħ/2 * 2 ) /7 = ħ/7.

Which confirms the earlier result.

So, everything checks out. The probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14, which are approximately 0.6429 and 0.3571. The options round them to 0.64 and 0.36, which makes sense.

So the correct option is A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we start by normalizing the given state \( |\alpha\rangle \), which is proportional to \( (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \). The norm squared of the state is calculated as:

\[
|1+i|^2 = 1^2 + 1^2 = 2, \quad |2-i|^2 = 2^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 + 1 = 5, \quad \text{and} \quad \text{total norm} = 2 + 5 = 7.
\]

Thus, the normalized state is:

\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} |\uparrow\rangle + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} |\downarrow\rangle.
\]

Next, the operator \( A \) has the matrix representation:

\[
A = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & \frac{\hbar}{2} \\ \frac{\hbar}{2} & 0 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

This operator is proportional to the Pauli \( \sigma_x \) matrix, \( A = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_x \). The eigenstates of \( \sigma_x \) are the spin eigenstates along the \( x \)-axis, given by:

\[
|+x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|\uparrow\rangle + |\downarrow\rangle), \quad |-x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|\uparrow\rangle - |\downarrow\rangle).
\]

To find the probabilities of measuring the particle in \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \), we compute the inner products of \( |\alpha\rangle \) with these eigenstates. The inner products are:

\[
\langle +x|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} \right) = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}},
\]
\[
\langle -x|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} - \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} \right) = \frac{-1 + 2i}{\sqrt{14}}.
\]

The probabilities are the squared magnitudes of these inner products:

\[
P(+x) = \left| \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}} \right|^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.643, \quad P(-x) = \left| \frac{-1 + 2i}{\sqrt{14}} \right|^2 = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.357.
\]

Rounding these to two decimal places, the probabilities are approximately \( 0.64 \) and \( 0.36 \).

To compute the average value of \( A \), we note that \( A = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_x \), so the expectation value of \( A \) is:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \langle \sigma_x \rangle.
\]

For a state \( |\psi\rangle = a|\uparrow\rangle + b|\downarrow\rangle \), the expectation value of \( \sigma_x \) is:

\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = 2 \, \text{Re}(ab^*).
\]

Here, \( a = \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} \) and \( b = \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} \). Calculating \( ab^* \):

\[
ab^* = \frac{(1+i)(2+i)}{7} = \frac{1+3i}{7}.
\]

The real part is \( \text{Re}(ab^*) = \frac{1}{7} \), so:

\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{7} = \frac{2}{7}.
\]

Thus:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \frac{2}{7} = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

Finally, comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**A) Probabilities \( 0.64 \) and \( 0.36 \), average value \( \hbar/7 \).**
