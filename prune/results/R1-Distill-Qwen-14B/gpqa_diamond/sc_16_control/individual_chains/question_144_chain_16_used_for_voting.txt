Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonances. I'm a bit rusty on particle physics, but let me try to work through this step by step. 

The question is about finding the mean decay distance of a meson X. The given data are E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are all in the order of 1e-15 to 1e-16 meters, so I think it's going to involve some relativistic calculations, maybe involving the lifetime and then converting that to distance.

Hmm, right. I remember that the mean lifetime (tau) of a particle is related to its width. The uncertainty principle says that the lifetime is inversely proportional to the width. The formula I think is tau ≈ ħ / Γ, where Γ is the total decay width. Oh wait, but wait, units are important here.

Wait, so the decay width Γ is given in MeV, and ħ is in units of GeV·s or something? I need to be careful with the units. Let me recall the constants. Planck's constant h is about 6.626e-34 J·s. But since we're dealing with particle physics, using natural units might help, but I'm not too sure. Alternatively, I can convert everything into consistent units.

Wait, natural units where ħ c = 197.3 MeV·fm. Or maybe I should just compute it using SI units. Let's think.

First, calculate the lifetime tau. The mean lifetime is tau = ħ / (Γ c^2). Wait, wait, no, I think the actual formula is tau = ħ / (Γ), but I need to make sure about the units.

Wait, in natural units where ħ c = 197.3 MeV·fm, but maybe I should just convert everything to meters and seconds.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Compute the lifetime tau of the meson X.
2. Calculate the speed of the meson using its energy and mass.
3. Multiply speed by lifetime to get the mean decay distance (L = v * tau).

Yes, that makes sense. So let's break it down.

First, compute the lifetime. The width Γ is 320 MeV. 

I know that ħ is approximately 6.582 x 10^-25 GeV·s. Wait, let's check: Planck constant h is 6.626e-34 J·s. ħ is h/(2π) ≈ 1.054e-34 J·s. But in terms of GeV·s, since 1 GeV = 1.602e-10 J, so ħ ≈ 1.054e-34 J·s / (1.602e-10 J/GeV) ) ≈ 6.582e-25 GeV·s. Right.

So, ħ ≈ 6.582e-25 GeV·s.

Γ is given as 320 MeV. Let me convert that to GeV: 320 MeV = 0.32 GeV.

So tau = ħ / (Γ) = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) ) = 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Wait, wait, no, because Γ is the total decay width, which for a particle is related to the inverse of the lifetime via the uncertainty principle. The formula is tau ≈ ħ / Γ. So yes, that's correct.

But wait, sometimes the formula uses the width Γ as a mass (energy) and ħ has units of GeV·s, so when you divide, you get seconds. That makes sense.

So tau is approximately (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) ) = approx 2.057e-24 seconds.

Now, step 2: find the speed v of the meson. The meson has energy E_X =8 GeV and mass m_X =1.2 GeV. Oh, wait, because in particle physics, energies are often given in GeV, and masses in GeV/c², but when using E² = (pc)² + (m c²)², the units can get tricky. Alternatively, since E and m are given in GeV, I can consider natural units where c=1 and ħ=1, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the velocity using beta = v/c = sqrt(1 - (m²)/(E²)).

Yes, because in special relativity, the relation between energy, mass, and velocity is given by E = gamma m c², and gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta²), where beta is v/c.

So, beta = sqrt(1 - (m²)/(E²)).

Plugging in the numbers: m_X =1.2 GeV, E_X =8 GeV.

So m/E = 1.2 /8 = 0.15.

So m²/E² = (0.15)^2 = 0.0225.

So 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775.

So beta = sqrt(0.9775) ≈ sqrt(0.9775) ≈ let me compute that. 0.9775 is about (0.9887)^2, because 0.9887^2 = 0.9775. Alternatively, sqrt(0.9775) ≈ about 0.9887.

So beta is approximately 0.9887, which means v ≈ 0.9887c.

So, v ≈ 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s ≈ 2.966e8 m/s.

Wait, but I should compute it more accurately. Let's compute sqrt(0.9775):

Let me compute 0.9775. Let's do it step by step.

Compute 0.9775^0.5:

I can approximate: x^2 = 0.9775.

Let me try 0.9887^2 = (0.98 + 0.0087)^2.

= (0.98)^2 + 2 * 0.98 * 0.0087 + (0.0087)^2.

= 0.9604 + 0.017172 + 0.00007569 ≈ 0.9604 + 0.01724769 = 0.97764769, which is about 0.97765, which is a bit higher than 0.9775. So the actual sqrt(0.9775) is approximately 0.9887 - a little less.

Let me compute 0.9885^2:

0.9885^2 = (0.98 + 0.0085)^2 = 0.9604 + 2*(0.98)*(0.0085) + 0.0085^2.

Calculate each term:

First term: 0.9604.

Second term: 2 * 0.98 * 0.0085 = 1.96 * 0.0085 = 0.01666.

Third term: 0.0085^2 = 0.00007225.

Add them: 0.9604 + 0.01666 = 0.97706, plus 0.00007225 gives 0.97713225. So 0.9885^2 ≈ 0.977132, which is lower than 0.9775.

So between 0.9885 and 0.9887.

Let me take 0.9886^2:

= (0.9885 + 0.0001)^2 = 0.97713225 + 2*(0.9885)*(0.0001) + (0.0001)^2.

= 0.97713225 + 0.0001977 + 0.00000001 = 0.97732996.

Still lower than 0.9775.

Next, 0.98865^2:

= 0.9886^2 + 2*0.9886*0.00005 + (0.00005)^2.

Wait, 0.9886^2 is 0.97732996 as above.

Adding 2*(0.9886)*0.00005 = 0.00009886.

And (0.00005)^2 is negligible.

So total is 0.97732996 + 0.00009886 ≈ 0.97742882.

Still less than 0.9775.

Next, 0.98867^2:

Compute 0.98865^2 + 2*(0.98865)*0.00002 + (0.00002)^2.

0.98865^2 is approx 0.97742882.

Adding 2*0.98865*0.00002 = 0.000039546.

So 0.97742882 + 0.000039546 ≈ 0.977468366.

Still less than 0.9775.

So 0.98867^2 ≈0.977468.

Hmm, 0.9775 is still a bit higher. So the square is about 0.9775, so the sqrt is about 0.98867 plus some more.

Let me compute how much more.

We have 0.98867^2 = 0.977468.

We need to reach 0.9775.

The difference is 0.9775 - 0.977468366 = 0.000031634.

So, let's approximate using linear approximation.

Let f(x) = x². We have f(0.98867) = 0.977468366.

We want f(x) = 0.9775. So delta = 0.9775 - 0.977468366 = 0.000031634.

Approximate delta x ≈ df = 2x dx → dx ≈ delta/(2x).

x is 0.98867, so 2x ≈ 1.97734.

So dx ≈ 0.000031634 / 1.97734 ≈ 1.598e-5.

So x ≈ 0.98867 + 0.00001598 ≈ 0.98868598.

So sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.98868598. So approximately 0.98869.

So beta is approximately 0.9887 (let's take it as 0.9887c for the purpose of calculation).

So v ≈ 0.9887 * (3e8 m/s) ≈ 2.966e8 m/s.

Now, the mean decay distance L is v multiplied by the lifetime tau.

So L = v * tau.

v ≈ 2.966e8 m/s.

tau ≈ 2.057e-24 s.

So L ≈ 2.966e8 m/s * 2.057e-24 s = ?

Calculating that:

2.966e8 * 2.057e-24 = (2.966 * 2.057) * 1e8 * 1e-24 = (approx 6.116) * 1e-16 m.

Wait, 2.966 * 2.057 is let me compute:

2.966 * 2 = 5.932, 2.966 * 0.057 ≈ 0.168. So total ~5.932 + 0.168=6.1.

So L ≈ 6.1e-16 meters.

Wait, but looking at the options, the choices are around 1e-15 or 1e-16 meters.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let's recalculate.

Wait, the numbers:

tau = ħ/(Gamma) = 6.582e-25 GeV·s / 0.32 GeV = 2.056875e-24 s.

v = 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s ≈ 2.9661e8 m/s.

L = 2.9661e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = let's compute this.

Multiply 2.9661e8 by 2.056875e-24:

First, 2.9661 * 2.056875 ≈ let's compute that.

2.9661 * 2 = 5.9322.

2.9661 * 0.056875 = approx 0.1681.

Total is approximately 6.1003.

So the product is 6.1003e(8-24) = 6.1003e-16 meters.

Looking at the options, option D is 4.0655e-16, option A is 5.0223e-16, option C is 5.0223e-15, and option B is 4.0655e-15.

Wait, my calculation gives approx 6e-16, but the closest option is A) 5.02e-16. Hmm, but why is there a discrepancy?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of beta. Let me recheck the beta calculation.

Wait, beta = sqrt(1 - m²/E²).

m is 1.2 GeV, E is 8 GeV.

So m²/E² = (1.44)/(64) = 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. So sqrt(0.9775) is approximately 0.9887 as I did before.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it more accurately. Let's compute sqrt(0.9775) using a calculator approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use more precise values for ħ.

Wait, I used ħ as 6.582e-25 GeV·s, but perhaps it's 6.582 x 10^-25 GeV·s.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the width is in MeV, so Gamma is 320 MeV.

Wait, I converted it to 0.32 GeV correctly.

Hmm. Another thought: maybe the formula for the mean decay length is different. Let me think again.

Wait, the mean lifetime is tau = ħ / (Gamma). But wait, is Gamma in the denominator? Because Gamma is the total decay width, which is the energy width. So yes, tau = ħ / Gamma.

Wait, but in natural units where ħ c = 197.3 MeV·fm, perhaps I can compute the lifetime and distance using those units.

Let me try that approach. Maybe it's easier.

In natural units, c=1, ħ=6.582e-25 GeV·s, but maybe using 197.3 MeV·fm is better.

Wait, since ħ c ≈ 197.3 MeV·fm, so ħ = 197.3 MeV·fm / c, but since c=1 in these units, perhaps it's better to calculate in terms of MeV and fm.

Let me try this.

So, Gamma is 320 MeV. So tau = ħ c / (Gamma c^2) ?

Wait, perhaps in natural units, c=1, so tau = ħ / Gamma.

Wait, but in natural units, ħ has units of GeV·s, but this might complicate. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the lifetime in seconds.

Wait, I think I did the first approach correctly. Let me recap.

Tau calculation: (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) = 2.056875e-24 seconds.

v = 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s ≈ 2.966e8 m/s.

L = v * tau = 2.966e8 * 2.056875e-24 = approx 6.1e-16 m.

But none of the options are close to 6e-16. The closest is option A:5.02e-16 m.

Hmm. So perhaps my initial approach is wrong. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the decay length formula differently.

Wait another thought: perhaps the formula for the mean path is L = gamma * beta * c * tau, where gamma is the Lorentz factor.

Wait, gamma is E/(m c²). Since E is 8 GeV and m is 1.2 GeV, gamma =8/1.2 ≈6.6667.

Wait, so gamma = 6.6667, beta is approx 0.9887.

So L = gamma * beta * c * tau.

Wait, but tau is the proper lifetime, so the mean lifetime observed is gamma * tau. Thus, the mean path is v * (gamma tau) = beta c * gamma tau = gamma beta c tau.

Wait, but perhaps I should compute it that way.

So gamma = 8/1.2 = 6.66667.

Beta is 0.9887.

So L = gamma * beta * c * tau.

But tau is ħ / Gamma, so let's compute:

tau = 6.582e-25 GeV s / 0.32 GeV = 2.056875e-24 s.

So gamma * beta = 6.66667 * 0.9887 ≈6.6 * 0.9887 ≈ approx 6.526.

So L = 6.526 * c * tau.

c is 3e8 m/s.

So L =6.526 *3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.

Compute 6.526 *3 =19.578.

19.578 * 2.056875 ≈ let's compute.

19.578 *2=39.156.

19.578 *0.056875≈ 1.1108.

Total ≈40.2668.

So 40.2668e(8-24) =40.2668e-16 m ≈4.0267e-15 m.

Wait, which is about 4.027e-15 m. Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15, option D is 4.0655e-16.

Hmm, that's close to option B.

Wait, but wait, in this approach, I used L = gamma beta c tau.

Wait, tau is the proper lifetime, and the observed lifetime is gamma tau, so the mean path is beta c * gamma tau, which is correct.

Wait, so with gamma =8/(1.2) =6.66667, beta as 0.9887, tau=2.056875e-24 s.

So, let's compute:

gamma * beta = (8/(1.2)) * sqrt(1 - (1.2/8)^2).

Wait, let's compute that.

gamma =8/1.2=6.6666667.

beta = sqrt(1 - (1.44/64))=sqrt(1-0.0225)=sqrt(0.9775)=0.9887.

So gamma*beta=6.6666667 *0.9887≈6.588.

So L=6.588 * c * tau.

c is 3e8 m/s.

tau is 2.056875e-24 s.

So,

6.588 * 3e8 = 1.9764e9.

Multiply by 2.056875e-24:

1.9764e9 *2.056875e-24 = 4.0655e-15 meters.

Ah, that's option B:4.0655e-15 m.

Wait, so the correct answer would be B.

Wait, but earlier I thought I got 6e-16 m, but that was without using gamma. So why the discrepancy? Because I think I forgot to use gamma in the first approach.

In the first approach, I thought L = v tau, but tau is the proper lifetime, so in the lab frame, the lifetime is gamma tau, and velocity is beta c. So the correct formula is L = beta c * gamma tau.

So that gives 4.0655e-15 m, which matches option B.

But let me double-check the calculation.

Compute gamma*beta:

gamma = 8/1.2 = 6.6666666667.

beta = sqrt(1 - (1.2/8)^2) = sqrt(1 - (0.15)^2) = sqrt(0.9775) ≈0.98868.

So gamma*beta = 6.6666666667 * 0.98868 ≈6.6 * 0.98868 ≈6.526.

Wait, but more accurately:

Let me compute 6.6666666667 *0.98868.

6 *0.98868 =5.93208.

0.6666666667 * 0.98868 ≈0.6666666667 *0.98868 = approx 0.65912.

Total≈5.93208 +0.65912=6.5912.

So gamma*beta= approx 6.5912.

So L=6.5912 * c * tau.

c=3e8 m/s.

Tau=2.056875e-24 s.

So,

L=6.5912 *3e8 *2.056875e-24.

Compute 6.5912 *3=19.7736.

19.7736 *2.056875 = ?

Let me compute 20 *2.056875=41.1375.

But 19.7736 is 20 minus 0.2264.

So 19.7736 *2.056875 =41.1375 - (0.2264 *2.056875).

Compute 0.2264 *2.056875.

0.2 *2.056875=0.411375.

0.0264 *2.056875≈0.054225.

Total≈0.411375 +0.054225=0.4656.

So 41.1375 -0.4656=40.6719.

So 40.6719e(8-24) =40.6719e-16 =4.06719e-15 m.

Which is approximately 4.067e-15 m. The option B is 4.0655e-15 m, which is very close.

So considering that, the correct answer is option B.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the mean decay distance of the meson resonance \( X \), we use the following steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the lifetime (\( \tau \))
The mean lifetime of a particle is related to its decay width (\( \Gamma \)) by the formula:

\[
\tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma}
\]

Given:
- \( \hbar \approx 6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV·s} \)
- \( \Gamma = 320 \, \text{MeV} = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \)

Substituting the values:

\[
\tau = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV·s}}{0.32 \, \text{GeV}} = 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the velocity (\( v \)) of the meson
The velocity of the meson is determined using the relativistic relation:

\[
\beta = v/c = \sqrt{1 - \frac{m^2}{E^2}}
\]

Given:
- \( E_X = 8 \, \text{GeV} \)
- \( m_X = 1.2 \, \text{GeV} \)

First, compute \( \frac{m^2}{E^2} \):

\[
\frac{m^2}{E^2} = \frac{(1.2)^2}{(8)^2} = \frac{1.44}{64} = 0.0225
\]

Then:

\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - 0.0225} = \sqrt{0.9775} \approx 0.9887
\]

Thus, the velocity is:

\[
v = \beta c = 0.9887 \times 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \approx 2.966 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the mean decay distance (\( L \))
The mean decay distance is given by:

\[
L = v \cdot \tau
\]

Substituting \( v = 2.966 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \) and \( \tau = 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s} \):

\[
L = (2.966 \times 10^8) \cdot (2.056875 \times 10^{-24}) = 6.1 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{m}
\]

### Step 4: Refine the calculation using \( \gamma \beta \)
To account for relativistic effects, the mean decay distance can also be expressed as:

\[
L = \gamma \beta c \tau
\]

Where \( \gamma \) is the Lorentz factor:

\[
\gamma = \frac{E}{m} = \frac{8}{1.2} \approx 6.6667
\]

Thus:

\[
\gamma \beta = 6.6667 \cdot 0.9887 \approx 6.5912
\]

Substituting into the formula for \( L \):

\[
L = 6.5912 \cdot (3 \times 10^8) \cdot (2.056875 \times 10^{-24})
\]

First, compute \( 6.5912 \cdot 3 \times 10^8 \):

\[
6.5912 \cdot 3 \times 10^8 = 1.97736 \times 10^9
\]

Then:

\[
L = 1.97736 \times 10^9 \cdot 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} = 4.067 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}
\]

### Final Answer
The mean decay distance is approximately \( 4.067 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \), which matches option **B**.

**Answer: B**
