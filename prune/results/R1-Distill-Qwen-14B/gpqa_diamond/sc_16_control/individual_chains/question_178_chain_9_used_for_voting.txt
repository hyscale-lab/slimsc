Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem gives a Lagrangian: L_int = κ ψ_bar σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. And σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2) [γ_mu, γ_nu]. The question asks about the mass dimension of κ and whether the theory is renormalizable. The options are A to D.

Hmm, I remember that in quantum field theory, the mass dimension of a coupling constant plays a big role in renormalizability. So I need to figure out the mass dimension of κ here and then see if the theory is renormalizable.

First, let's recall that the mass dimension is a way to keep track of units in natural units (where c=ħ=1). Each term in the Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4 because the action is dimensionless, and the integral over four-dimensional spacetime (dx^4) has mass dimension -4. So Lagrangian density must have dimension 4.

So each term in the Lagrangian must be dimension 4. Let's look at L_int: it's κ multiplied by ψ_bar, σ_{μν}, ψ, and F^{μν}.

Wait, ψ is a spinor field. I think that the Dirac spinor ψ has mass dimension 3/2. Because in four dimensions, the fields must have certain dimensions to make the kinetic terms in the Lagrangian have dimension 4. The kinetic term for ψ is something like i ψ_bar γ^μ ∂_μ ψ, which must have dimension 4. Each derivative ∂_μ has dimension 1 (since it's like momentum, which has dimension 1). So ψ_bar γ ψ ∂ would be (3/2) + (3/2) + 1 = 5. But wait, that's the kinetic term. So to have dimension 4, each ψ must have dimension 3/2 because [ψ_bar][γ][ψ][∂_μ] would be (3/2) + (3/2) +1 = 5, but that's too high. Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, no. The term is ψ_bar i γ^μ ∂_μ ψ. So let's calculate the dimension of that term. ψ_bar has dimension 3/2, γ matrices are dimensionless, ∂_mu has dimension 1. So ψ_bar ∂_mu ψ is 3/2 + 1 + 3/2 = 5. But the entire term is multiplied by i, which is dimensionless, so the term has dimension 5. But wait, the Lagrangian must have dimension 4. So this can't be right. Hmm, I must have made a mistake.

Wait, no, wait. The kinetic term is part of the Lagrangian, which is supposed to have dimension 4. So the term ψ_bar i γ^μ ∂_μ ψ must have dimension 4. So each ψ has dimension (4 - 1)/2 = 3/2? Because the derivative is dimension 1. So each ψ is 3/2. Because ψ_bar is same as ψ.

Wait, let me think again. The term is ψ_bar (which is a Dirac spinor conjugate, same dimension as ψ) times i γ^μ (dimensionless) times ∂_mu (dimension 1) times ψ. So the term must have dimension [ψ][ψ][∂] = (3/2) * (3/2) * 1 = 9/4. But that's only 9/4, and the term has a derivative, but that's in the term. Wait, maybe I'm confusing the dimensions here.

Alternatively, perhaps each ψ has dimension 3/2 because the term ψ_bar ∂_mu ψ must have dimension 4. So, since the term is ψ_bar ∂_mu ψ, which is (3/2) + 1 + (3/2) = 3/2 + 3/2 +1 = 5. But wait, the term should have dimension 4. Hmm, that's a problem. So I must have messed up the dimensions. Maybe I should think in another way.

Wait, no, the term is part of the Lagrangian, which is a density. So each term must have dimension 4. So the kinetic term is ψ_bar i γ^mu ∂_mu ψ. Let's compute its dimension. ψ has dimension d, ∂_mu has dimension 1. So the term: (d) + (d) +1 = 2d +1 =4 → 2d=3 → d=3/2. Yes, that makes sense. So each ψ has dimension 3/2.

So ψ_bar is same as ψ, so dimension 3/2.

Now, let's look at the term in L_int: κ ψ_bar σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}.

I need to compute the mass dimension of each component.

First, ψ_bar has dimension 3/2, ψ has 3/2, so ψ_bar ψ has dimension 3.

σ_{μν} is a tensor made from the commutator of gamma matrices. Since gamma matrices are dimensionless, [γ_mu, γ_nu] is dimensionless, so σ_{mu nu} is dimensionless. So σ_{mu nu} contributes nothing to the mass dimension.

Then F^{mu nu} is the field strength tensor for electromagnetism or something similar. The field strength F is ∂_mu A_nu - ∂_nu A_mu, so each term has dimension [∂][A]. So A has dimension 1 (since F has dimension 2, because ∂ is 1, A is 1, so F is 1+1=2).

So F^{mu nu} has dimension 2.

Putting it all together, the term is κ * (3/2) * (3/2) * 2.

Wait, let me compute each component's dimension:

κ → What's its dimension? Let's see. The entire term must have dimension 4 since it's part of the Lagrangian.

So, the product: κ [ψ_bar][σ_{mu nu}][ψ][F^{mu nu}] must have dimension 4.

Each [ψ_bar] is 3/2, [ψ] is 3/2, [F] is 2. σ is dimensionless, so:

κ * (3/2) * (3/2) * 2 = κ * ( (3/2)^2 * 2 ) = κ * (9/4 * 2)= κ * (9/2) = 4.

So, the equation is [κ] * (9/2) = 4 → [κ] = (4) * (2/9) = 8/9 ≈ 0.888...

Wait, but that's not an integer. Hmm, that can't be right because usually coupling constants have integer mass dimensions, like 0, 1, -1, etc.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in evaluating the dimensions.

Wait, perhaps I should recompute the dimensions again. Let me list each factor:

ψ_bar: 3/2

σ_{mu nu}: dimensionless → 0

ψ: 3/2

F^{mu nu}: 2

So the product ψ_bar ψ F is (3/2) * (3/2) * 2 = (9/4) *2 = 9/2. So the product is 9/2.

So the term is κ * (9/2) → and the term must have dimension 4. So  [κ] + 9/2 =4 → [κ] =4 - 9/2 = (8/2 -9/2) = -1/2. But wait, that's not an integer either. Hmm, that's odd. Did I miss a factor?

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something else. Let me think about the structure of the term.

The term is ψ_bar σ_{mu nu} ψ F^{mu nu}. Let me count the number of fields and derivatives.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps I should think about the Lagrangian as a whole. Each term must have dimension 4. So the entire term should be dimension 4. So [L] =4.

So [κ] * [ψ_bar] [σ] [ψ] [F] =4.

We have [ψ_bar] = 3/2, [ψ]=3/2, [F]=2.

So [κ] * (3/2) * (3/2) * 2  =4 → [κ] * (9/4 *2) =4 → [κ]*(9/2) =4 → [κ] =4 * (2/9) → 8/9. Which is about 0.888. But that's not an integer, which is strange because the options have κ with mass dimension -1 or 1.

Wait, this suggests that perhaps I made an error in the dimensions of F^{mu nu}. Let me re-examine that.

F^{mu nu} is the field strength tensor, which is ∂_mu A_nu - ∂_nu A_mu.

Each ∂ has dimension 1. So A_mu (the gauge field) has dimension 1, because F is ∂A, so [F] = [∂][A] =1 +1=2.

So [F] is correct as 2.

Hmm, then why am I getting [κ] as 8/9, which is approximately 0.89? But the options suggest that κ has dimension either 1 or -1.

Wait, perhaps the term in the Lagrangian is not dimension 4. No, that can't be. Because the Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4. So each term in the Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4.

Wait, maybe I miscalculated the number of gamma matrices or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the term is not a standard Dirac term but has a different number of fields.

Wait, wait, what about the structure of the term: ψ_bar σ_{mu nu} ψ F^{mu nu}.

σ_{mu nu} is an antisymmetric tensor constructed from the commutator of gamma matrices. So each σ_{mu nu} is a product of two gamma matrices. So each σ is like (i/2) [γ_mu, γ_nu], which would have two gamma matrices, but since they are in a commutator, perhaps it's dimensionless as I thought before.

Wait, maybe I should think about the number of derivatives or the number of fields. Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the Feynman rules, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the term is not correctly accounted for in terms of the number of fields. Let me think about the term again.

Wait, the term is ψ_bar σ_{mu nu} ψ F^{mu nu}.

Wait, σ_{mu nu} is a Lorentz tensor, but in terms of Dirac matrices, it's a product of two gammas. So each σ_{mu nu} is something like γ_mu γ_nu antisymmetric.

Wait, perhaps the sigma tensor is a Lorentz tensor, so when we write ψ_bar σ_{mu nu} ψ, that's a scalar? Because ψ_bar is a row vector, σ_{mu nu} is a Lorentz tensor, and ψ is a column vector. So when you contract them, you get a scalar. Then multiplied by F^{mu nu}, which is a tensor, so the product σ·F is a scalar?

Wait, perhaps I should think about the dimensions in terms of the number of fields and derivatives. Let me write down each term:

- Each ψ has dimension 3/2 → ψ_bar has 3/2.
- σ_{mu nu} is made from two gamma matrices, so dimension 0.
- F^{mu nu} is a field strength tensor, which is ∂A, so dimension 2.

So the product [ψ_bar][σ][ψ][F] is (3/2) * (3/2) * 2 = (9/4) * 2 = 9/2.

So the term is κ multiplied by 9/2 → [κ] + 9/2 =4 → [κ] =4 - 9/2 = -1/2.

Wait, that's the same as before. That's not matching any of the options, which are either -1 or 1.

This suggests that something is wrong with my approach. Maybe I should think about the number of derivatives involved. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the definition.

Wait, looking back, the Lagrangian is given as ψ_bar σ_{mu nu} ψ F^{mu nu}.

Wait, maybe I should count the number of fields and derivatives in this term. Let's see:

Each ψ is a field, so each contributes 3/2. F is 2, as before.

So:

κ (ψ_bar σ ψ) F → So the product is (3/2 + 3/2) + 2 → but wait, no, each ψ is a field, so it's 3/2 per ψ.

Wait, let me think of the term as κ (ψ_bar σ_{mu nu} ψ) F^{mu nu}.

So the product inside the parentheses is ψ_bar (σ F) ψ. No, wait, maybe not. σ_{mu nu} is a Lorentz tensor, F is a tensor, so when you multiply σ_{mu nu} F^{mu nu}, that's a scalar. Then the term is ψ_bar (σ F) ψ, which is a scalar times ψ_bar ψ. So the dimension is [ψ_bar][ψ] [σ][F].

Wait, but [ψ_bar][ψ] is (3/2) + (3/2) =3.

[σ] is dimensionless, [F] is 2. So the product is 3 * 2 =6.

So the term is κ multiplied by 6, and the entire term must have dimension 4. So:

[κ] +6 =4 → [κ] = -2.

But that's not matching any options either. I'm getting confused here.

Wait, perhaps I'm not counting the terms correctly. Let me think again.

Alternatively, maybe I should use the formula for renormalizability. The interaction term must have mass dimension <=4 for the theory to be renormalizable.

Wait, the mass dimension of the coupling κ is [κ] =4 - (sum of the dimensions of the fields in the term, counting derivatives as fields with dimension 1).

So the term is κ ψ_bar σ ψ F.

Each ψ is 3/2, F is 2. So the sum of the fields is 3/2 +3/2 +2 = 8/2=4. So the term is κ multiplied by 4, so for the dimension to be 4, [κ] must be 0. Because 4 [κ] =4 → [κ] =0.

Wait, that's conflicting with earlier calculations. Hmm.

Wait, but that approach might not be correct. Because the term is [κ] + sum([field dimensions]) =4.

So the sum of the field dimensions in the term is [ψ_bar] + [ψ] + [F].

ψ_bar is 3/2, ψ is 3/2, F is 2. So 3/2 +3/2 +2 = 4.

So [κ] +4 =4 → [κ]=0.

But none of the options have κ with dimension 0. So something's wrong.

Wait, maybe I forgot to count the derivatives.

Wait, wait, no. The F tensor is made from derivatives of A, but in the term, F is treated as a field with dimension 2. So the fields in the term are ψ, ψ, and F. So their dimensions sum to 3/2 +3/2 +2 =4.

So [κ] +4 =4 → [κ]=0.

But the options don't have that. So I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the number of fields and derivatives in the term. The term is ψ_bar σ ψ F.

Wait, but σ is built from gamma matrices, so it's part of the structure, not a separate field. So the fields in the term are ψ, ψ, and F. So sum of their dimensions is 3/2 +3/2 +2 =4.

So [κ] =4 -4=0.

But the options don't have [κ] =0.

Hmm, this is getting me stuck. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the term in terms of the operator's scaling. The operator σ_{mu nu} F^{mu nu} is a dimension 2 operator? Because F is dimension 2, and σ is dimensionless. So the operator is dimension 2.

Then the term is ψ_bar (σ F) ψ → which is (3/2 +3/2) +2 = 3 +2=5. Wait, but that's the dimension of the operator part.

But the term is part of the Lagrangian, so dimension must be 4. So the term is κ multiplied by that operator, so:

κ * (5) =4 → [κ] = -1.

Ah! That makes sense. Because [term] = [κ] + [operator] = [κ] +5 =4 → [κ]=-1.

Wait, that would give [κ]=-1, which is option A and C.

So, then the mass dimension of κ is -1.

Now, about renormalizability. The theory is renormalizable if the coupling constant has mass dimension ≤4 in 4 dimensions. Wait, no, in 4 dimensions, the coupling must have dimension ≥0 (I think). Because the coupling appears in the term L ∼ g φ^n, and the dimension of g is d =4 - n*(d_φ), where d_φ is the dimension of each field φ.

Wait, but in this case, the term is L ∼ κ ψ_bar σ F ψ. The operator is dimension 5, as I thought earlier. Because ψ is 3/2, so two ψ's make 3, and F is 2, so 3+2=5. So the operator has dimension 5. The coupling is κ, which is dimension -1, so the term is dimension 4.

But for renormalizability, the dimension of the coupling must be ≥0. Because the dimension of the coupling is [g] =4 - (sum of fields' dimensions in the term). If [g] is negative, the coupling is dimensionful, and the interaction term has a dimension higher than 4, which makes the theory non-renormalizable. Because in such a case, higher order terms (like g^2, g^3, etc.) would have even higher dimensions, leading to non-renormalizable interactions.

In our case, [κ]=-1, which is negative. So the theory is non-renormalizable. Because the interaction term has a dimension higher than 4.

Wait, but wait: the operator has dimension 5, and the coupling has dimension -1. So the term is dimension 4. So each vertex in the Feynman diagram would bring a factor of κ, which is dimension -1. But when you have higher order loops, the integrals would bring factors of momentum, which is dimension 1. So the overall dimension would get messed up, making the theory non-renormalizable.

So the theory is not renormalizable because [κ]=-1 <0.

So looking back to the options:

Option C says [κ]=-1 and the theory is not renormalizable. So that's our answer.

Alternatively, let's double-check.

Wait, the mass dimension of the coupling is [κ]=-1.

Renormalizability condition: [g] ≥ 0. Because in 4 dimensions, terms with [g] <0 lead to non-renormalizable theories. Because when you expand the interaction, higher powers of the coupling will have higher negative dimensions, making the terms more relevant and the theory non-renormalizable.

So yes, [κ] =-1 <0 → the theory is not renormalizable.

Therefore, the correct answer is option C.

To determine the mass dimension of the coupling constant $\kappa$ and whether the theory is renormalizable, we analyze the given Lagrangian:

\[
\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}} = \kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu},
\]
where $\sigma_{\mu\nu} = \frac{i}{2}[\gamma_\mu, \gamma_\nu]$ and $F^{\mu\nu}$ is the field strength tensor.

### Step 1: Mass Dimensions of Fields
- The Dirac spinor $\psi$ has mass dimension $[\psi] = \frac{3}{2}$, as it appears in the kinetic term $\bar{\psi} i \gamma^\mu \partial_\mu \psi$, which must have dimension 4.
- The field strength tensor $F^{\mu\nu}$ has dimension $[F^{\mu\nu}] = 2$, as it is constructed from derivatives of the gauge field $A_\mu$, which has dimension 1.

### Step 2: Mass Dimension of $\kappa$
The Lagrangian density $\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}}$ must have mass dimension 4. The term $\kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu}$ contributes the following dimensions:
- $[\bar{\psi}] = \frac{3}{2}$ (same as $[\psi]$),
- $[\sigma_{\mu\nu}] = 0$ (dimensionless, as it is constructed from commutators of $\gamma$ matrices),
- $[F^{\mu\nu}] = 2$.

The total dimension of the term is:
\[
[\kappa] + [\bar{\psi}] + [\psi] + [F^{\mu\nu}] = [\kappa] + \frac{3}{2} + \frac{3}{2} + 2 = [\kappa] + 4.
\]
Since the Lagrangian must have dimension 4, we solve:
\[
[\kappa] + 4 = 4 \implies [\kappa] = 0.
\]

### Step 3: Renormalizability
A theory is renormalizable if the coupling constant $\kappa$ has mass dimension $[\kappa] \geq 0$. In this case, $[\kappa] = 0$, which satisfies the condition for renormalizability.

### Conclusion
The mass dimension of $\kappa$ is $[\kappa]_M = 0$. The theory is renormalizable.
