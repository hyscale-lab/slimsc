Hmm, okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to think it through step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to remember what I learned.

The question is about an electron in a state proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. I need to find the probabilities of measuring it in each eigenstate of a certain operator. Oh, and also the average value of that operator.

Wait, the operator's matrix representation is given. Aij is hbar/2 if i≠j, and 0 otherwise. So the matrix would be a 2x2 matrix because we're dealing with spin-½ particles, I think. So in the basis of |up> and |down>, the matrix for operator A would be:

[0, hbar/2]
[hbar/2, 0]

Because A_12 and A_21 are hbar/2, and the diagonals are zero.

But wait, the problem says the operator whose matrix is A_ij. So the operator is A, and the eigenstates are the eigenstates of this matrix A. Hmm, okay, so I need to find the eigenstates of this operator and then compute the probabilities of measuring the electron in those states.

Wait, but the given state |alpha> is expressed in the |up> and |down> basis. So first, perhaps I should find the probabilities in the |up> and |down> states, then express |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of A, and find the probabilities from there. Or maybe find the eigenstates of A and then find the projections.

Wait, no. Let me think again. So the operator in question is A, with matrix:

A = [[0, ħ/2],
     [ħ/2, 0]]

Because when i≠j, A_ij = ħ/2. So it's a 2x2 matrix with zero on the diagonal and ħ/2 elsewhere.

Now, the eigenstates of A would be the eigenstates of this matrix. Let's find those first.

The eigenvalues are found by solving det(A - λI) = 0.

So the matrix becomes:

[-λ, ħ/2]
[ħ/2, -λ]

The determinant is λ² - (ħ²/4) = 0 → λ² = (ħ²)/4 → λ = ± ħ/2.

So the eigenvalues are ħ/2 and -ħ/2. Hmm, that makes sense because the matrix is similar to the Pauli matrices, I think.

The eigenstates can be found for each eigenvalue.

For λ = ħ/2: (A - (ħ/2) I) |v> = 0.

So the matrix becomes:

[-ħ/2, ħ/2],
[ħ/2, -ħ/2]

Which gives the equation (-ħ/2) v1 + (ħ/2) v2 = 0 → -v1 + v2 = 0 → v1 = v2.

So the eigenvector is proportional to [1, 1]^T. To normalize, since |1|^2 + |1|^2 = 2. So the normalized eigenstate is (1/sqrt(2)) |up> + (1/sqrt(2)) |down>.

Similarly, for λ = -ħ/2: The matrix becomes:

[ ħ/2, ħ/2 ],
[ ħ/2, ħ/2 ]

Wait, no. Wait A - (-ħ/2) I is [[ ħ/2, ħ/2 ], [ ħ/2, ħ/2 ]]. Hmm, so the equations are (ħ/2)v1 + (ħ/2)v2 = 0 → v1 + v2 = 0 → v2 = -v1.

So the eigenvector is [1, -1]^T, normalized as (1/sqrt(2)) |up> - (1/sqrt(2)) |down>.

So the eigenstates of operator A are |+> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and |-> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because these states are the eigenstates of the Pauli X matrix, which is the same as the operator A here, right? Because the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], and here A is (ħ/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]]. So yes, the eigenstates are the same as for X.

So the state |alpha> is given as proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>.

First, we need to find the normalization factor. Let's calculate the norm of the state.

The state is |alpha> = (1+i) |up> + (2 -i) |down>.

The norm squared is |1+i|^2 + |2 -i|^2.

Calculating each magnitude squared:

|1+i|^2 = (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 1 + 1 = 2.
|2 -i|^2 = (2)^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 + 1 =5.

So the norm squared is 2 +5=7. So the normalized state is |alpha> = [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

Now, the probability of measuring the eigenvalue +ħ/2 is the square of the amplitude of |+> in the state |alpha>.

Alternatively, the state |alpha> can be written as a linear combination of |+> and |->.

But perhaps a better approach is to compute the projection of |alpha> onto each eigenstate of A.

Let me compute the inner product of |alpha> with each eigenstate |+> and |->.

First, |+> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2).

The amplitude is < + | alpha >.

Expressed as (1/sqrt(2)) [ < up | + < down | ] times ( [ (1+i) |up> + (2-i) |down> ] / sqrt(7) ).

So < + | alpha > = (1/(sqrt(2) sqrt(7))) [ (1+i) * 1 + (2 -i) * 1 ].

Because < up | up > = 1, < up | down > = 0, and same for < down | up >.

Wait, no: < up | (|up> + |down>) is 1*1 + 0*1 =1, so when you apply the inner product to each term, you get (1+i) * 1 (from < up | up> ) plus (2- i) * 1 (from < down | down> ), because < up | down> is zero.

Wait, no, let's correct.

Wait, the inner product < + | alpha > is (1/sqrt(2)) [1, 1] multiplied by the vector [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ]^T.

So it's (1/(sqrt(2) sqrt(7))) [ (1+i) + (2 - i) ].

Simplify the numerator: (1 + i) + (2 - i) = 3 + 0i = 3.

So < + | alpha > = 3/(sqrt(2) sqrt(7)).

The probability is the square of the absolute value of this amplitude.

So |3/(sqrt(14)) |^2 = 9/(14).

Similarly, now the inner product with |->.

|-> is (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

So < - | alpha > = (1/(sqrt(2) sqrt(7))) [ (1+i) *1 - (2 -i) *1 ].

Compute the numerator:

(1+i) - (2 -i) = (1-2) + (i +i) = (-1) + 2i.

So the inner product is (-1 + 2i)/(sqrt(14)).

The probability is the square of the magnitude of this.

The magnitude squared is [(-1)^2 + (2)^2] = 1 +4=5. So 5/(14).

Wait, but let me double-check.

Wait, the inner product is (1/(sqrt(2) sqrt(7))) times [ (1+i) - (2 -i) ].

Which is (1 + i - 2 +i ) = (-1 + 2i).

So the amplitude is (-1 + 2i)/(sqrt(14)).

The magnitude squared is ( (-1)^2 + (2)^2 )/(14) )= (1 +4)/14=5/14.

So the probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14.

Wait, 9+5=14, which adds correctly to 1, so that's good.

So the probabilities are 9/14 ≈ 0.642857 and 5/14 ≈ 0.357143.

Looking at the options, option A says 0.64 and 0.36, which is close to these numbers. Option C is 0.28 and 0.72, which is off. Option D is 0.61 and 0.29, which is close but not exactly.

Wait, but let's see the options again.

Option A: 0.64, 0.36 and hbar /7 → so the probabilities are approx 64% and 36%, which matches our 9/14 (~64.29%) and 5/14 (~35.71%). So 0.64 and 0.36 are rounded.

But wait, 9/14 is approximately 0.642857, which is about 0.643, so 0.64 is a close approximation. Similarly, 5/14 is about 0.357, which is 0.36 when rounded to two decimal places.

So the probabilities would match option A. But wait, let's check what the average value is.

The expectation value of the operator A is <alpha| A |alpha>.

Alternatively, since A has eigenvalues ħ/2 and -ħ/2, the expectation value would be (9/14)(ħ/2) + (5/14)(-ħ/2).

Which is [9*(1) +5*(-1)]/(14 * 2) ) * ħ.

Compute 9 -5 =4 → 4/(28) ) → 1/7.

So the expectation value is (1/7) ħ.

So putting it all together, the probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, and the average is ħ/7.

Looking at the options, option A is 0.64, 0.36, and ħ/7. So that seems correct.

But wait, another approach: perhaps the operator is Hermitian, so the average is the real part of the expectation value. But in our calculation, it's (9/14)(ħ/2) + (5/14)(-ħ/2) = (9-5)/(14*2) * ħ.

Wait, 9-5 is 4, 14*2 is 28. 4/28 is 1/7, so expectation is (1/7) ħ. So yes, that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I could have used another method.

Wait, another approach: The operator A is (ħ/2) times the Pauli X matrix. So the expectation value is (ħ/2) times the expectation value of the Pauli X in the state |alpha>.

The expectation value of X is <alpha| X |alpha>.

So X is the Pauli matrix [[0,1],[1,0]].

The state |alpha> is (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down>, normalized by 1/sqrt(7).

So to compute <X>, it's (1/sqrt(7))^2 times [ (1+i)(2 -i) + (2-i)(1+i) ].

Wait, because <X> = (1/7) [ (1+i)(2 -i) + (2-i)(1+i) ].

Wait, let me compute that.

Compute (1+i)(2-i) = 2(1) + 1(-i) + i*2 + i*(-i) = 2 -i + 2i - i².

But i² is -1, so 2 + i +1 = 3 +i.

Similarly, (2 -i)(1+i) = 2*1 + 2i -i*1 -i^2 = 2 + 2i -i +1 = 3 +i.

So sum is (3+i) + (3+i) = 6 + 2i.

So <X> = (6 +2i)/(7).

Wait, but the expectation value of X is a real number when the state is real, but in this case, it's complex. How can that be?

Wait, no, wait. Because X is Hermitian, its expectation value should be real. Oh, because the state is not necessarily a real state.

Wait, but if the state is a general complex state, the expectation of a Hermitian operator should be real. So perhaps I made a mistake in the computation.

Let me recompute (1+i)(2 -i) and (2 -i)(1+i).

First term: (1+i)(2-i) = 1*2 +1*(-i) +i*2 +i*(-i) = 2 -i + 2i -i².

i squared is -1, so 2 +i +1 =3 + i.

Second term: (2 -i)(1+i) = 2*1 +2*i -i*1 -i*i = 2 +2i -i -i².

i squared is -1, so 2 +i +1 =3 +i.

So the sum is 3+i +3+i =6 + 2i.

Wait, but <X> is (6+2i)/(7) + (6+2i)/(7) ? No, wait, no, the sum is (3+i) + (3+i) =6 +2i. So <X> = (6 + 2i)/7.

But wait, that's a complex number, which can't be right because X is Hermitian and the expectation value should be real. So I must have made a mistake in my approach.

Wait, perhaps I should have considered that the expectation value of X is (alpha_u alpha_d^* + alpha_d alpha_u^*) where alpha_u is the coefficient of |up> and alpha_d is coefficient of |down>.

Because X is represented as [[0,1],[1,0]], so the expectation value is (1+ i)(2 -i)* + (2 -i)(1 +i)*.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think.

The state is |alpha> = [ (1+i) |up> + (2-i) |down> ] / sqrt(7).

Then, <X> = (1/sqrt(7))² [ (1+i)^* (2-i) + (2 -i)^* (1+i) ]

Because X has elements X_12 =1 and X_21=1. So the expectation is sum_{i,j} <alpha| X_ij |alpha> → which is (1/sqrt(7))² [ (1+i)(2-i) + (2 -i)(1 +i) ].

Wait, no, wait. The proper way is <alpha| X |alpha> = sum_{i,j} (alpha_i^*) X_ij alpha_j.

So for 2x2, X_12 =1, X_21=1, and X_11=X_22=0.

So <X> = (alpha_1^* alpha_2) + (alpha_2^* alpha_1).

So alpha_1 is (1+i)/sqrt(7), alpha_2 is (2 -i)/sqrt(7).

So <X> = [( (1+i)/sqrt(7) )^* ( (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ) ] + [ ( (2 -i)/sqrt(7) )^* ( (1+i)/sqrt(7) ) ].

Compute each term.

First term: (1-i)(2 -i) /7.

(1-i)(2 -i) = 2(1) + 1*(-i) -i * 2 + i².

= 2 -i -2i + (-1) → (2-1) + (-3i) → 1 -3i.

Second term: (2 +i)(1 +i) /7.

(2 +i)(1 +i) = 2*1 + 2i +i*1 +i^2 → 2 +2i +i -1 → (2-1) +3i →1 +3i.

Adding both terms: (1 -3i + 1 +3i)/7 → (2)/7 → 2/7.

So <X> = 2/7.

Then, the expectation value of A is (ħ/2) * <X> = (ħ/2)(2/7) )= ħ/7.

Which matches our previous calculation.

So the average value is ħ/7.

So the probabilities are 9/14 (~0.643) and 5/14 (~0.357), and the average is ħ/7.

Looking back at the options:

Option A: 0.64, 0.36, and ħ/7 → matches.

Option C: 0.28,0.72 → 2/7 is ~0.286, but that's for probability if the state was in |->, which is 5/14= ~0.357.

No, so option A is the correct one.

To solve the problem, we analyze the given state and operator. The state is proportional to \( | \alpha \rangle = (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \), and the operator \( A \) has the matrix representation:

\[
A = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{\hbar}{2} \\
\frac{\hbar}{2} & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 1: Eigenstates of \( A \)
The eigenvalues of \( A \) are \( \pm \frac{\hbar}{2} \), and the corresponding eigenstates are:

\[
|+\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|\uparrow\rangle + |\downarrow\rangle), \quad |-\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|\uparrow\rangle - |\downarrow\rangle).
\]

### Step 2: Normalize \( | \alpha \rangle \)
The given state \( | \alpha \rangle \) is normalized by dividing by its norm. The norm squared is:

\[
\| | \alpha \rangle \|^2 = |1+i|^2 + |2-i|^2 = 2 + 5 = 7.
\]

Thus, the normalized state is:

\[
| \alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} \left( (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \right).
\]

### Step 3: Probabilities of Measuring Eigenstates
The probabilities of measuring the eigenstates \( |+\rangle \) and \( |-\rangle \) are calculated by projecting \( | \alpha \rangle \) onto these states. The projection onto \( |+\rangle \) is:

\[
\langle + | \alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( (1+i) + (2-i) \right) \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}}.
\]

The probability is:

\[
P(+\hbar/2) = \left| \langle + | \alpha \rangle \right|^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.64.
\]

Similarly, the projection onto \( |-\rangle \) is:

\[
\langle - | \alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( (1+i) - (2-i) \right) \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} = \frac{-1 + 2i}{\sqrt{14}}.
\]

The probability is:

\[
P(-\hbar/2) = \left| \langle - | \alpha \rangle \right|^2 = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.36.
\]

### Step 4: Average Value of \( A \)
The average value of \( A \) is given by:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \langle \alpha | A | \alpha \rangle.
\]

Using the eigenvalues and probabilities:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \left( \frac{9}{14} \right) \frac{\hbar}{2} + \left( \frac{5}{14} \right) \left( -\frac{\hbar}{2} \right) = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

### Step 5: Match with Options
From the calculations:
- Probabilities: \( P(+\hbar/2) \approx 0.64, P(-\hbar/2) \approx 0.36 \),
- Average value: \( \langle A \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{7} \).

This matches **Option A**.

### Final Answer:
**Answer: A**
