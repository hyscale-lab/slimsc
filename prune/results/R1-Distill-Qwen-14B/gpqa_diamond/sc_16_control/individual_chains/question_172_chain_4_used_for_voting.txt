Okay, so I have this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, let me try to think this through step by step.

The question says that iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh wait, no, wait. It says the iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited. Oh, wait, I think I misread that. Oh no, wait: the energy difference between the energy levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. So the energy levels in the iron atoms have a specific difference, and the excitation is about how many atoms are in higher energy levels.

Wait, the problem states that the energy difference between the considered energy levels is approximately 1.38e-23 J. So this is the energy ΔE between two levels. And the excitation is about how many atoms are in each level. Oh, right, in LTE (Local Thermal Equilibrium), the distribution of atoms in energy levels follows the Boltzmann distribution.

The Boltzmann equation says that the ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels is given by (n2/n1) = (g2/g1) * exp( - (ΔE)/(k*T) ), where g's are the statistical weights, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is temperature.

In this case, since the question says iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Wait, does that mean the population of a higher energy level is twice as much in star_1 compared to star_2? Or is it that the excitation (like the energy) is twice as much? Probably, it's the population ratio.

So for each star, the ratio of the number of excited atoms (level 2) to the lower one (level 1) is given by the Boltzmann factor. Let me denote n2/n1 for star_1 as 2, since it's twice as excited. So for star_1, (n2_1/n1_1) = 2. For star_2, maybe it's a different ratio, say r.

Wait, but the problem says the excitation is twice as excited in star_1 compared to star_2. Oh wait, I think I need to clarify that. The question says, "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So for the same energy level, star_1's atoms are twice as excited? Or the population in a higher level is twice as much.

Wait, maybe the problem is that the excitation potential (which is the energy difference) is the same for both stars, but the excitation level (the population in higher energy states) is different. So for each star, the population ratio is governed by the Boltzmann factor.

Let me model this.

Let’s denote for each star, the ratio n2/n1.

For star_1: n2_1 / n1_1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

Similarly, for star_2: n2_2 / n1_2 = (g2/g1) * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Assuming that g2/g1 is the same for both stars because it's the same element and energy levels, so I can write the two equations.

Given that n2_1 / n1_1 = 2, because star_1's population is twice as much excited. So for star_1, (n2_1/n1_1) = 2.

For star_2, perhaps I need to relate their excitation. Wait, but the problem states that in star_2, the excitation is lower. So the ratio would be less than 2. Wait, no, the problem doesn't state that. It only says that the excitation is twice when compared. Let me re-read.

The first part says: "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So star_1's excitation is higher. So for the same energy level, the population ratio in star_1 is higher than star_2.

Wait, but I think the term "excited" here refers to the number of atoms in the higher energy level. So if star_1 has twice as many atoms in the excited state (level 2) compared to star_2, then n2_1 / n1_1 = 2, and n2_2 / n1_2 = let's say r. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem says star_1's n2 is twice star_2's n2, but that might not directly relate to the Boltzmann ratios because each is dependent on their own temperature.

Hmm, perhaps a better approach is to take the ratio of the two Boltzmann factors.

So, for star_1: (n2_1 / n1_1) = (g2/g1) exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

For star_2: (n2_2 / n1_2) = (g2/g1) exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

If I take the ratio of these two, (n2_1/n1_1) / (n2_2/n1_2) ) = [exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) / exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) ) ]

Which simplifies to exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Wait, let me see. Because:

exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) / exp(-ΔE/(k T2)) = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Because when you divide exponents, you subtract exponents. So:

= exp [ (ΔE/(k T2) ) - (ΔE/(k T1) ) ) ]

= exp [ ΔE/(k) ( 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ) ]

So, the ratio of (n2/n1) for star1 to that for star2 is exp(ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

But the question says that in star_1, the excitation is twice that of star_2. So (n2/n1)_1 = 2 * (n2/n1)_2

Wait, no. Wait, wait. The problem says the excitation is twice as excited, which might mean that the ratio (n2/n1) for star_1 is twice that of star_2.

So (n2/n1)_1 = 2 * (n2/n1)_2

So when I take the ratio [(n2/n1)_1] / [(n2/n1)_2] = 2

Which is equal to exp(ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

So:

ln(2) = [ΔE/(k)] (1/T2 - 1/T1 )

Because taking the natural log of both sides.

Wait, but wait, the problem states that the energy difference is 1.38e-23 J. Let me think about the units. Boltzmann's constant k is 1.38e-23 J/K, right?

So ΔE is given as 1.38e-23 J. So ΔE = 1.38e-23 J.

So putting that in:

ΔE/(k) = (1.38e-23 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) ) = 1 K.

So ΔE/(k) = 1 K.

So ln(2) = (1 K) (1/T2 - 1/T1 )

Which can be rewritten as:

ln(2) = ( T1 - T2 ) / ( T1 T2 )

Because 1/T2 - 1/T1 = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

Ah, so:

ln(2) = (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2 )

Which rearranged is ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

Looking at the options:

Option D is ln(2) = (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2 )

Yes, that's the same as what I have here.

So the correct equation is option D.

The question involves determining the relationship between the effective temperatures of two stars based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. The problem states that the excitation of iron atoms in star_1 is twice that of star_2, and the energy difference between the considered energy levels is given as \( \Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \). Using the Boltzmann distribution, the ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels is given by:

\[
\frac{n_2}{n_1} = \frac{g_2}{g_1} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right),
\]

where \( g_2/g_1 \) is the statistical weight ratio, \( k \) is Boltzmann's constant, and \( T \) is the temperature. For star_1, the excitation ratio is \( \frac{n_2/n_1}{\text{star}_1} = 2 \), and for star_2, it is \( \frac{n_2/n_1}{\text{star}_2} \). Taking the ratio of these two expressions and simplifying:

\[
\frac{\frac{n_2/n_1}{\text{star}_1}}{\frac{n_2/n_1}{\text{star}_2}} = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right).
\]

Since the excitation of star_1 is twice that of star_2, this ratio equals 2. Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right).
\]

Substituting \( \Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \) and \( k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K} \), we find:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} = 1 \, \text{K}.
\]

Thus, the equation becomes:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

This matches option D, which states:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

Answer: D
