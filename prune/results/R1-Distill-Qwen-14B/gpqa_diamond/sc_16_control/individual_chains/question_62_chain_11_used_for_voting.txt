Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct sequence of reagents to synthesize a specific compound. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The target molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. I think that's a mouthful. Let me try to visualize its structure. So, it's a cyclohexane ring with a substituent. The substituent is a (cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl) group attached to the cyclohexane. Additionally, the molecule has a carbaldehyde group (CHO) attached as well. Wait, no, wait—actually, the parent chain is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, meaning the aldehyde is at the 1-position, and the substituent is on the same carbon? Hmm, perhaps. Let me think again.

Wait, the name is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So, the main structure is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. The "1" position refers to where the substituent is attached. So, the aldehyde is at position 1 of the cyclohexane. Then, the substituent is a (cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl) group attached to that same carbon. So, the substituent is a methyl group that's connected to a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxy group. So, the structure would be a cyclohexane ring with a CHO group on carbon 1, and also, a CH2 group attached to that same carbon, where the CH2 is connected to a cyclohexyl group and an OH group. So, that CH2 is connected to both the cyclohexane (the main ring) and another cyclohexyl group (through the substituent) and an OH.

The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. Ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane with a triple bond ethynyl group attached. So, structure is cyclohexane-CC≡CH.

I need to find a way to convert ethynylcyclohexane into the target molecule through a series of reactions. Let's look at the options given and see which sequence makes sense.

The options are A, B, C, D, each with four steps. I'll go through each step in each option and see which one logically leads to the target.

First, let's outline what needs to happen in the synthesis:

1. Ethynyl group needs to be modified. The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. The target has a cyclohexane ring with a substituent that includes a cyclohexyl group and an OH group attached to a CH2 group, which is on the same carbon as the aldehyde.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the possible steps involved. Ethynylcyclohexane can undergo various reactions. One common reaction is the hydration of the triple bond. Hydration with HgSO4 and H2SO4 in water would give a ketone. Wait, but the position depends on the conditions. For example, acid-catalyzed hydration of an alkyne (like ethynylcyclohexane) would give a ketone. So, HgSO4 and H2SO4, H2O would add water across the triple bond to form a ketone.

But looking at the target molecule, perhaps the aldehyde is formed from an oxidation. Alternatively, maybe the triple bond is converted into a carbonyl group.

Alternatively, another approach is to think about the possible steps in each option.

Option A: Steps are NaNH2, methyl chloride; H2/Pd; Ba(OH)2; H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O.

Wait, NaNH2 and methyl chloride are often used for alkylations, like in the formation of a Grignard reagent or for alkylation via a strong base. Wait, no, NaNH2 is a strong base, maybe used for deprotonating things. Oh wait, methyl chloride with NaNH2—could that be a methyl Grignard? Or perhaps it's for a substitution, but I'm not sure. Or maybe NaNH2 is used for eliminating. Alternatively, methyl chloride as a methylating agent? Alternatively, perhaps it's a Birch reduction?

Hmm, perhaps I should think about each option step by step.

Let me think about the target molecule. It has a cyclohexane ring with a substituent that's a CH2-OH-cyclohexyl group and an aldehyde. So, the aldehyde might come from an oxidation step, perhaps oxidation of a secondary alcohol to a ketone? Wait, no, wait. Alternatively, maybe the aldehyde is directly formed from an alkyne through oxidation.

Wait, another thought: The target has a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH2-OH and another cyclohexane. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the ethynyl group is converted to a carbonyl group, then perhaps functionalized further.

Let me consider the possible steps:

1. The ethynyl group (CC≡CH) in ethynylcyclohexane is at position 1. So, maybe the first step is to add a methyl group next to it, then perhaps do some hydrogenation, then oxidation, and so on.

Option D: Steps are NaNH2, methanol; Li/liq. NH3; O3/ (CH3)2S; NH4OH.

Wait, NaNH2 with methanol. Hmm, could that be a way to perform alkylation or something else? Or perhaps that's for deprotonating and then methylating.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step is a deprotonation to form a cyclopropyl anion or something similar. Alternatively, NaNH2 is used in elimination reactions, like in the formation of alkynes from alkenes via dehydrohalogenation. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, another approach: Let's think about what each step in the options does.

Looking at the first step in each option:

Option A: Step 1 is NaNH2, methyl chloride. That might be for alkylation. NaNH2 is a strong base, and methyl chloride is a methylating agent. Maybe it's a way to add a methyl group to the cyclohexane ring. But NaNH2 is used in deprotonating aromatic rings to form strong bases, but cyclohexane isn't aromatic. Alternatively, perhaps it's for a Birch reduction, but that requires more specific conditions.

Wait, another possibility: NaNH2 and methyl chloride could be for a methyl Grignard reaction. But wait, Grignard reagents are typically formed with Mg. NaNH2 is a strong base, maybe used for deprotonating compounds, like in the formation of alkynides. For example, terminal alkynes can be deprotonated with NaNH2 to form an alkyne anion, which is a strong base.

Wait, ethynylcyclohexane is CH2C≡CH attached to cyclohexane. So, the terminal alkyne (ethylcyclohexane) would have the alkyne proton. Deprotonation with NaNH2 would form the alkyne anion, which is a strong base. Then adding methyl chloride (CH3Cl) would methylate it. So, the alkyne would become CH2C≡C-Me.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Another thought: the first step could be deprotonating the alkyne to form an alkyne anion, then methyl chloride would provide a methyl group, so perhaps adding a methyl group to the alkyne.

Wait, perhaps that's a way to add a methyl group to the triple bond. So, ethynylcyclohexane (cyclohexane-CC≡CH) treated with NaNH2 would deprotonate the alkyne to cyclohexane-C≡C-^- which would attack methyl chloride (CH3Cl) to form cyclohexane-C≡C-CH2-... Wait, no, I think the alkyne would have the structure R-C≡CH. Deprotonation gives R-C≡C^− Na^+. Then, methyl chloride would react as an electrophile. So, the alkyne anion would attack CH3Cl, adding a methyl group to the triple bond. So, R-C≡CH + NaNH2 → R-C≡C^- Na^+; then, CH3Cl would give R-C≡C-CH2-Cl? No, wait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, perhaps the alkyne anion would add a methyl group to the triple bond, giving R-C≡C-CH3, but that would be a propargyl group, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the methyl group is added to the cyclohexane ring. But cyclohexane isn't aromatic, so I don't know if NaNH2 would deprotonate it. Maybe the alkyne's proton is being deprotonated.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step in option A is converting the ethynyl group into an ethyl group via alkyne alkylation. But I'm not too sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step in option A is for elimination. Maybe the starting material is treated with a strong base like NaNH2, which would cause elimination. But ethynylcyclohexane isn't set up for elimination, perhaps.

Hmm, perhaps it's better to think about each option in terms of the steps leading to the target.

The target has an aldehyde group. So, perhaps one of the steps involves oxidizing a primary alcohol to an aldehyde. But oxidation of a primary alcohol typically gives a carboxylic acid, unless it's controlled to stop at the aldehyde. Alternatively, maybe the alkyne is oxidized to an aldehyde.

Wait, another approach: The target has both an aldehyde and a cyclohexyl group attached. So maybe the ethynyl group is first converted into a carbonyl group, then perhaps some kind of addition occurs.

Wait, let's plan what needs to happen:

1. Starting with ethynylcyclohexane, we need to form some structure that can lead to the target. Perhaps adding a substituent to the ethynyl group.

2. The target has a hydroxyl group attached to a CH2 group, which is attached to the cyclohexane. So, perhaps a hydroxyl group is introduced via some kind of epoxide opening or via a dihydroxylation or maybe via a Grignard reaction followed by hydrolysis.

Wait, another idea: Maybe the alkyne is converted into an epoxide, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a ketone, then subjected to some kind of addition to form the cyclohexyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is first hydrogenated to an alkene, then subjected to some dihydroxylation to form a diol, which can then be manipulated.

Wait, looking at the options again, some options involve O3 (ozone), which is used in ozonolysis. Ozonolysis of an alkene would break the double bond and form carbonyl groups.

So, let's see option B: step 3 is O3/H2O, step 4 is NH4OH. So, maybe after some steps, an alkene is formed, then ozonolysis would cleave it into carbonyl groups.

Option C: step 3 is O3 with (CH3)2S, step 4 is Ba(OH)2. So, that's a different workup for ozonolysis, which typically uses reductive workup to give aldehydes/ketones, whereas oxidative workup (like with H2O and then Zn) gives carboxylic acids or ketones.

Option D: steps 3 is O3 with (CH3)2S, step 4 is NH4OH.

Hmm. Let me think about the target molecule again. It has a cyclohexane ring with a substituent that's a CH2 group attached to a cyclohexyl group and OH. So, that substituent could come from a cyclohexyl group attached via a CH2-OH group. Wait, maybe it's a result of a substitution reaction or perhaps an addition after oxidation.

Alternatively, perhaps the synthesis involves forming a diol, which is then oxidized, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the steps in each option and see which sequence could lead to the target.

Let me consider option D:

1. NaNH2, methanol.

Hmm, NaNH2 is a strong base. Methanol is a methylating agent perhaps. Wait, NaNH2 and methanol could be used for deprotonation and methylation. Alternatively, perhaps it's a way to form an alkoxide. Alternatively, maybe it's for a Birch reduction, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: The first step in option D is NaNH2 and methanol. Methanol is CH3OH. So, NaNH2 (a strong base) in methanol. Hmm, perhaps it's a way to form a methyl group on the starting material.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step is a deprotonation and alkylation, but I'm not entirely certain.

Then step 2 is Li in liquid NH3. Li (lithium metal) and liquid NH3 is a common condition for Birch reductions, which reduce aromatic rings to cyclohexadienes or cyclohexane derivatives. But the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane, which isn't aromatic, so perhaps this is for deprotonating the alkyne? Or maybe it's a method for elimination.

Wait, another possibility: Li in liquid NH3 is used for the formation of alkyllithium reagents, but the starting material is an alkyne. Alternatively, perhaps it's used for deprotonating an alkyne to form an alkyne anion, which can then react.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to think of each option's steps.

Option C:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride: Maybe methylating the alkyne to form a longer chain.

2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate: Hydrogenation of the triple bond to cis or trans alkene. So, ethynyl becomes ethylene.

3. O3/(CH3)2S: Ozonolysis with a reductive workup, which would break the double bond into carbonyl groups. So, if the starting material after step 2 is a cyclohexene ring with a double bond adjacent, ozonolysis would form two carbonyl groups.

4. Ba(OH)2: Maybe a oxidation step or elimination. Or perhaps Ba(OH)2 is used for forming epoxides or other functions.

Wait, but I'm not sure how this would form the target structure.

Option D:

1. NaNH2, methanol: Maybe deprotonating the alkyne to form the anion, then reacting with methanol to form an ether? Or perhaps quenching with MeOH to form a methyl group.

Wait, NaNH2 is a strong base; in methanol, maybe it abstracts a proton somewhere. But where?

Alternatively, perhaps the first step is for alkyne deprotonation, then methanol acting as an electrophile. So, the alkyne becomes R-C≡C-OCH3? Not sure.

Then step 2 is Li in liquid NH3, which might be a Birch reduction, but the starting material isn't aromatic. Hmm.

Alternatively, could step 2 be for deprotonating something else?

Alternatively, maybe step 2 is for elimination, forming a diene or something else.

But this is getting complicated. Maybe I should think about the overall process.

The target has an aldehyde group and a substituent that's a cyclohexyl-CH2-OH. So, perhaps the synthesis involves forming a carbonyl group and then some kind of addition or substitution.

Wait, another thought: Perhaps the ethynyl group is converted into an aldehyde. How? Maybe through oxidation. So, if the triple bond is oxidized to a carbonyl group, that would give cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. But wait, the target has a substituent as well as the aldehyde.

Wait, no, because the aldehyde is at position 1, and the substituent is also at position 1. So, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a carbonyl group, and then some addition occurs.

So, let's think: Starting with ethynylcyclohexane (cyclohexane-C≡CH), perhaps the alkyne is oxidized to a ketone, but then how do we get an aldehyde?

Wait, another point: The target has an aldehyde, which is a terminal carbonyl group. So, perhaps the triple bond is directly converted into an aldehyde. How? Hydration of the alkyne would typically give a ketone if done under acid conditions. To get an aldehyde, perhaps it's done under different conditions.

Wait, another possibility: The alkyne is first reduced to an alkene, then subjected to ozonolysis to form a carbonyl group. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is functionalized to form a carbonyl group, and then undergoes some kind of addition reaction to form the substituent.

Wait, maybe the correct approach is to form a cyclopropane ring or some other ring structure, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a carbonyl group, and then a Grignard reagent is added to form the substituent.

Wait, perhaps the correct steps involve:

1. Alkyne deprotonation and alkylation (to add a substituent to the alkyne).

2. Reduction of the alkyne to an alkene.

3. Ozonolysis of the alkene to form carbonyl groups.

4. Some kind of oxidation or hydrolysis to form the hydroxyl group.

But I'm not entirely certain.

Looking at the options, the target involves a cyclohexyl group attached via a CH2-OH. So, perhaps a cyclopropane ring is involved, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about each option's steps and see which makes sense.

Option C: Steps are:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride → Maybe this is for a methylation of the alkyne.

2. H2/Pd-c → Hydrogenation of the triple bond to a single bond, giving an ethyl group attached to cyclohexane. Wait, H2/Pd would hydrogenate triple bonds to single bonds, so ethynylcyclohexane becomes cyclohexane-CH2CH3.

But wait, hydrogenation of triple bonds with H2 and a catalyst like Pd typically adds two H2 molecules, turning the triple bond into a single bond. So, the product would be cyclohexane with a CH2CH2 group? Wait, no, wait: The triple bond is C≡C. Adding H2 would make it CH2-CH2. So, ethynylcyclohexane (cyclohexane-CC≡CH) would become cyclohexane-CH2CH3 after hydrogenation.

Wait, but in reality, hydrogenation of a terminal alkyne (like ethynylcyclohexane) with H2 and a catalyst like Pd would typically yield cis-alkene first, and with excess H2, would hydrogenate to the single bond. So, I think that's correct.

Then step 3: Ozone with (CH3)2S. Ozonolysis would cleave any double bonds. But if after step 2, the triple bond is hydrogenated to a single bond (CH2CH3), then there's no double bond, so ozonolysis wouldn't do anything. Hmm, that's a problem. So, perhaps I was wrong about step 2.

Wait, maybe step 2 is hydrogenation but under different conditions. Alternatively, perhaps it's a different reaction.

Wait, step 2 in option C is H2/Pd-c. So, the alkyne would be hydrogenated to a cis-alkene, perhaps. Because sometimes, partial hydrogenation (using a poisoned catalyst) stops at the alkene. So, if the alkyne is hydrogenated to the alkene, then step 3 (ozone) would cleave it into carbonyl groups.

So, let's think through this:

Starting with ethynylcyclohexane (cyclohexane-CC≡CH).

Step 1: NaNH2, methyl chloride → perhaps methylating the alkyne. If the alkyne is deprotonated to R-C≡C^−, then methyl chloride could add a methyl group to give R-C≡C-CH2Cl? Or perhaps it's R-C≡C-CH3, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the alkyne is converted into an ethyl group.

Wait, it's a bit unclear. Alternatively, perhaps the first step is deprotonating the ethynyl group and then performing alkylation to add a methyl group adjacent to the triple bond.

Then step 2: H2/Pd-c → hydrogenates the triple bond to a single bond. So, if after step 1, the structure is cyclohexane-C≡C-CH3, then step 2 would hydrogenate to cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH3? But that doesn't make sense because the triple bond is between two CH2 groups.

Wait, maybe after step 1, the structure is cyclohexane-C≡C-CH2Cl. Then, hydrogenation would reduce the triple bond to CH2-CH2Cl, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial step is adding a methyl group to the cyclohexane ring, but I'm not sure how that would proceed.

Hmm. Another approach: perhaps the correct reagent sequence is to first deprotonate the alkyne, then add a methyl group to form a longer chain, hydrogenate that to an alkene, then ozonolyse to form carbonyls, and then do something else.

But this is getting too vague. Let me think about the target again. It has an aldehyde group and a substituent with a cyclohexyl and hydroxyl group.

Wait, perhaps the correct steps are:

1. Deprotonate the ethynyl group to form an alkyne anion.

2. Alkylation to add a methyl group to the triple bond, making it longer.

3. Hydrogenate the extended alkyne to an alkene.

4. Ozonolyse the alkene to form carbonyl groups.

5. Perform some kind of oxidation or hydrolysis to form the hydroxyl and aldehyde groups.

Wait, but the options only have four steps each, so maybe the steps are more efficient.

Another idea: The target has a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH2-OH. Perhaps a dihydroxylation followed by some substitution could lead to that.

Wait, perhaps the alkyne is first converted into a diol via some dihydroxylation, but I'm not sure how that would happen.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is first converted into a carbonyl group, then undergoes some aldol addition or other reaction.

Wait, let's think about option C again.

Option C steps:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride → maybe add methyl to alkyne, forming a longer chain.

2. H2/Pd-c → hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond.

3. O3/(CH3)2S → ozonolysis, which would break double bonds but after step 2, maybe the triple bond is now a single bond, so no double bond is present. Unless, perhaps, step 2 only partially hydrogenates the alkyne to an alkene.

Wait, maybe step 2 is a partial hydrogenation. So, the triple bond becomes a double bond.

So:

Step 1: NaNH2 and CH3Cl → perhaps the alkyne becomes R-C≡C-CH3.

Step 2: H2/Pd-c → partial hydrogenation to R-CH2-CH2-CH3? Or maybe to R-CH2-CH2-CH2- group?

Wait, no, if the alkyne is R-C≡C-CH3, hydrogenation would add H2 to make R-CH2-CH2-CH3. But that would require the triple bond to become a single bond, losing the triple bond.

Alternatively, perhaps step 2 is a hydrogenation that stops at the alkene, making R-CH2-CH2-CH2?

No, wait, the triple bond has two pi bonds. So, H2 would add to each pi bond. For a triple bond, two H2 molecules are needed to hydrogenate it to a single bond. So, the product after step 2 would be R-CH2-CH2-CH3.

But now, for step 3, O3 is used, which cleaves double bonds. But if after step 2, there are no double bonds, ozonolysis wouldn't do anything. So that can't be right.

Hmm, perhaps I was wrong about step 2. Maybe step 2 is for a different purpose.

Wait, another possibility: the first step is deprotonating the alkyne to form an alkyne anion, then methyl chloride adds a methyl group. So, the alkyne becomes R-C≡C-CH3. Then, step 2 is hydrogenation, which reduces the triple bond to R-CH2-CH2-CH3.

But then step 3 would require a double bond, which isn't present. So that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps step 2 is a different reaction. For example, if step 2 is a reduction of a ketone to an alcohol, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe step 2 is for a reduction of a nitrile to an amine, but that doesn't fit here.

Wait, perhaps the first step is deprotonating the alkyne to form the alkyne anion, then methyl chloride adds a methyl group to make R-C≡C-CH2Cl. Then, step 2 is H2/Pd-c, which would reduce the triple bond to a single bond, giving R-CH2-CH2Cl.

Then step 3 is O3/(CH3)2S. But that would require a double bond. So, unless step 2 is a partial hydrogenation, but I'm not sure.

I think I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should look for another approach, perhaps considering functional groups and how they can be formed.

The target has a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH2-OH, which is in turn attached to the cyclohexane. So, perhaps this substituent is introduced via a substitution reaction or via a Grignard addition.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent comes from a cyclohexanol group that undergoes some elimination or addition.

Wait, another thought: The substituent on the main ring is a CH2-OH-Cyclohexyl group. So, perhaps it's formed via a nucleophilic substitution where the CH2-OH- group is added.

Wait, but I'm not making progress. Maybe I should think about the steps in option D:

Option D steps:

1. NaNH2, methanol → perhaps deprotonate the alkyne, then react with methanol to form an ether. So, the alkyne becomes R-OCH3.

2. Li in liq. NH3 → perhaps Birch reduction, but the starting material isn't aromatic, so maybe it's for deprotonating something else or forming a lithium reagent.

3. O3/(CH3)2S → Ozonolysis, which would cleave a double bond into carbonyls.

4. NH4OH → Workup with ammonium hydroxide, perhaps to form aldehydes.

But I'm not sure how this leads to the target.

Alternatively, perhaps step 1 in D is for forming a Grignard reagent. NaNH2 and methanol might not form a Grignard, but maybe it's for deprotonating an alkyne to form an alkyne anion, which could react with something else.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is to first deprotonate the alkyne, then methylate, then hydrogenate, then perform ozonolysis.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps are:

1. Alkyne deprotonation to form an alkyne anion.

2. Alkylation to add a methyl group, making R-C≡C-CH3.

3. Hydrogenation of the triple bond to a single bond, making R-CH2-CH2-CH3.

But again, why would ozonolysis be needed after that?

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is first converted into a diol, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another plan: Let's think about the formation of the aldehyde and the substituent.

The aldehyde is at position 1, and the substituent is a CH2-OH-cyclohexyl group.

Perhaps the aldehyde comes from the oxidation of a primary alcohol. So, maybe after forming a primary alcohol, oxidation would give the aldehyde.

But how?

Another path: Maybe the alkyne is converted into a ketone, then some addition occurs.

Wait, perhaps the alkyne is first oxidized to a ketone. But oxidation of an alkyne would typically give a diketone or a ketone, depending on the conditions.

Wait, the target has an aldehyde, so perhaps the alkyne is converted into a carbonyl group.

So, here's a possible pathway:

1. Oxidize the alkyne to a carbonyl group, giving cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.

But how? Because oxidation of the alkyne would require specific conditions.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me try to think about the options again.

Looking at option D:

Steps are:

1. NaNH2, methanol.

2. Li, liq. NH3.

3. O3/(CH3)2S.

4. NH4OH.

Step 1: Maybe deprotonate the alkyne, then form a Grignard-like reagent. But I'm not sure.

Step 2: Li in liquid NH3 is often used for Birch reductions, but since the starting material isn't aromatic, perhaps it's for deprotonating the alkyne further or for elimination.

Alternatively, perhaps step 2 is for forming a lithium amide, which is a strong base.

Then step 3: Ozonolysis. So, perhaps a double bond is formed in step 2, which is then cleaved by ozonolysis.

But I'm not sure. Let me try to think about the possible reactions.

Suppose we have ethynylcyclohexane. Step 1: NaNH2 and methanol. Maybe this is for deprotonating the alkyne. Then, perhaps the alkyne is quenched with methanol, leading to an ether: R-OCH3. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, maybe the alkyne is converted into a methyl ether, R-OCH3.

Step 2: Li in liquid NH3. Perhaps this is for elimination, forming an alkene. So, R-OCH3 might undergo elimination to form an alkene, but I'm not sure about the mechanism.

Then step 3: Ozonolysis of the alkene to form carbonyl groups.

Step 4: NH4OH might be for workup, perhaps to form aldehydes.

But in the target, there's an aldehyde and a cyclohexyl group attached. So, maybe the ozonolysis forms a carbonyl, which becomes the aldehyde, and the other part forms the cyclohexyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a diol, which is then cleaved.

I think I'm not getting anywhere. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Wait, another thought: The target molecule has a structure where a CH2 group is attached to the cyclohexane. This CH2 has two substituents: a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group. So, it's a CH2(OH)(cyclohexyl) group.

So, perhaps this group is formed via a substitution reaction where a leaving group is replaced by this group.

Wait, but how would that substitution happen?

Alternatively, perhaps the CH2 group is formed via a coupling reaction, like a Grignard addition.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Convert the alkyne into a Grignard reagent.

2. Add a cyclohexanol group to it.

3. Oxidize to form the aldehyde.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a ketone, then subjected to a cyclohexanol addition.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me consider the correct reagents for each step.

The target has an aldehyde group and a hydroxyl group attached to a CH2 group. So, perhaps the aldehyde is formed from an oxidation, and the hydroxyl is from a reduction or a dihydroxylation.

Hmm.

Wait, another approach: The ethynyl group (sp-hybridized carbon) can be converted into a carbonyl group. So, perhaps the first step is to deprotonate the alkyne and then add a methyl group, making it R-C≡C-CH3. Then, hydrogenate this to R-CH2-CH2-CH3. But that doesn't seem helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a ketone via oxidation. Then, perhaps a Grignard addition occurs to add the cyclohexyl group.

Wait, but how would that fit into the options.

Another Idea: The target has a cyclohexane ring with a substituent that includes a hydroxyl group and a cyclohexyl group. Maybe this substituent comes from a cyclohexanol group that undergoes some kind of elimination or substitution.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is formed via a conjugate addition.

Wait, I think I'm stuck. Let me try to think about each option step by step.

Option C:

1. NaNH2 and methyl chloride → perhaps methylate the alkyne.

2. H2/Pd-c → hydrogenate triple bond to single bond → ethyl group.

3. O3, (CH3)2S → cleave any double bonds. But after step 2, there are no double bonds. So, this doesn't make sense.

Option B:

Steps are:

1. NaNH2, ethyl chloride → perhaps add ethyl group to alkyne.

2. Li/liq. NH3 → perhaps elimination or deprotonation.

3. O3/H2O → cleave double bond.

4. NH4OH → neutralize.

But I'm not sure.

Option D:

1. NaNH2, methanol → deprotonate alkyne, add OMe group.

2. Li/liq. NH3 → perhaps form a lithium reagent.

3. O3, (CH3)2S → cleave double bonds.

4. NH4OH → workup.

But I'm not seeing the connection.

Option A:

Steps are:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride → maybe add methyl group.

2. H2/Pd → hydrogenate to CH2CH3.

3. Ba(OH)2 → perhaps a strong base for elimination or epoxidation.

4. H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O → hydration of a triple bond? But after step 2, no triple bond.

Wait, perhaps after step 2, the triple bond is hydrogenated to a single bond. Then, step 3 is Ba(OH)2, which might cause elimination to form a double bond. But Ba(OH)2 is more commonly used for epoxidation or for forming epoxides from alkenes. Wait, no, Ba(OH)2 is a strong base that can cause elimination.

Alternatively, if step 3 is Ba(OH)2, perhaps it's for dehydrohalogenation or elimination.

But, I'm not seeing the pathway.

Wait, another thought: The target has a hydroxyl group. Perhaps one of the steps introduces an epoxide, which is then opened to form a diol, which is then manipulated.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct steps are:

1. Deprotonate the alkyne to form an alkyne anion.

2. Alkylation to add a methyl group (step 1 in options A, C, D).

3. Hydrogenate the alkyne to an alkene (step 2 in options A, C).

4. Ozonolysis to form carbonyl groups.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct steps are:

1. Deprotonate the alkyne and add a methyl group to form a longer alkyne.

2. Partial hydrogenation to form an alkene.

3. Ozonolysis to break the alkene into carbonyls.

4. Workup to form aldehyde and other groups.

But I'm not certain.

I think I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for the correct answer and then see why it's correct.

Wait, the target molecule has an aldehyde group and a substituent with a cyclohexyl and hydroxyl group. So, perhaps the aldehyde is formed through oxidation, and the substituent is via some addition.

Another Idea: The ethynyl group can be converted into a carbonyl group via hydration. So, using HgSO4 and H2SO4 in water, the alkyne becomes a ketone. But the target has an aldehyde, so perhaps a different condition is used for hydration to form an aldehyde.

Wait, but under acid conditions, the hydration of an alkyne typically gives a ketone. To get an aldehyde, perhaps the hydration is done under different conditions, like with a base. Or maybe it's a partial oxidation.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is first hydrogenated to an alkene, then oxidized to a carbonyl group.

Wait, hydrogenation of the alkyne to an alkene with H2 and Pd, then oxidation of the alkene to a carbonyl.

So, ethynylcyclohexane → (H2, Pd) → cyclohexane-CH2CH2 → oxidation → cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.

But that would give a molecule with a CH2CHO group. Not sure.

Wait, the target's aldehyde is attached to the cyclohexane, so maybe the alkyne is directly converted into the aldehyde.

So, perhaps step 1 is hydration of the alkyne to form an aldehyde.

But I'm not sure which reagents do that.

Wait, the options have step 3 and 4 involving O3 and various workups, which suggests that alkene formation is involved. So, perhaps the alkyne is first hydrogenated to an alkene, then ozonolysis is used to cleave it into carbonyl groups.

So, let's think:

Ethynylcyclohexane → (H2, Pd) → cyclohexene-CH2CH2 → but that doesn't seem right.

No, wait, the triple bond is at the end. So, ethynylcyclohexane is R-C≡CH. Partial hydrogenation would give R-CH2-CH2.

But I'm getting stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is first converted into a Grignard reagent, which then adds to a carbonyl group.

But I think I'm not getting anywhere. Maybe based on the options, option D is the correct one.

Wait, looking again at option D:

Step 1: NaNH2 and methanol. Could this be for deprotonating the alkyne and forming a methyl ether?

Step 2: Li in liq. NH3 → perhaps Birch reduction, but the starting material isn't aromatic.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a method to form a strong base.

Step 3: O3 with (CH3)2S → ozonolysis.

Step 4: NH4OH → aqueous workup.

But I'm not sure how this would form the target.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Deprotonate the alkyne to form an alkyne anion.

2. Alkylation to add a methyl group (using methyl chloride), making R-C≡C-CH2Cl.

3. Hydrogenate to R-CH2-CH2Cl.

4. Ozonolysis would not work here, as no double bonds.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Perhaps I should pick the option that uses ozonolysis to form the aldehyde and another carbonyl group, which would then be manipulated to form the substituent.

After considering, perhaps option D is correct. Because after ozonolysis with (CH3)2S, which is a reductive workup, the aldehyde would be formed, and the other part would form something else.

Wait, but the target has both an aldehyde and a hydroxyl group. So, perhaps the workup involves something else.

Alternatively, perhaps option C is correct. Let me think:

Option C steps:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride → add methyl group to alkyne.

2. H2/Pd-c → hydrogenate alkyne to single bond.

3. O3 with (CH3)2S → cleave any double bonds (but after step 2, no double bonds, so maybe this is for another purpose.

Hmm, not sure.

I think I'm going in circles. Maybe I should conclude.

After going through the options, I think the correct answer is option D. But I'm not fully confident.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves determining the correct sequence of reagents to synthesize 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde from ethynylcyclohexane. The target molecule has a cyclohexane ring with a substituent containing a hydroxyl group, a cyclohexyl group, and an aldehyde group. The analysis of the options is as follows:

### Key Analysis of Each Option:

#### **Option A**:
1. **NaNH₂, methyl chloride**: Likely involves deprotonating the alkyne and methylating it.
2. **H₂/Pd**: Hydrogenates the alkyne to a single bond, forming an ethyl group.
3. **Ba(OH)₂**: A strong base, possibly for elimination or epoxidation.
4. **H₂SO₄, HgSO₄, H₂O**: Hydration of a carbonyl group, but after step 2, no carbonyl is present. This sequence does not align with the target structure.

#### **Option B**:
1. **NaNH₂, ethyl chloride**: Likely methylates the alkyne.
2. **Li/liq. NH₃**: Used for deprotonation or elimination.
3. **O₃/H₂O**: Ozonolysis to cleave double bonds.
4. **NH₄OH**: Workup to neutralize. However, the sequence does not clearly explain how the hydroxyl and cyclohexyl groups are introduced.

#### **Option C**:
1. **NaNH₂, methyl chloride**: Methylation of the alkyne.
2. **H₂/Pd-c**: Partial hydrogenation of the alkyne to an alkene.
3. **O₃/(CH₃)₂S**: Ozonolysis to cleave the alkene into carbonyl groups.
4. **Ba(OH)₂**: Likely for elimination or oxidation. This sequence could plausibly form the aldehyde and introduce the hydroxyl group, but the exact mechanism for forming the cyclohexyl group is unclear.

#### **Option D**:
1. **NaNH₂, methanol**: Deprotonates the alkyne and potentially forms a methyl ether.
2. **Li/liq. NH₃**: Likely for deprotonation or elimination.
3. **O₃/(CH₃)₂S**: Ozonolysis to cleave double bonds.
4. **NH₄OH**: Workup to form aldehydes. This sequence could align with the formation of the aldehyde and hydroxyl group, but the introduction of the cyclohexyl group remains ambiguous.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing the options, **Option D** appears to be the most plausible sequence, as it involves steps that could lead to the formation of the aldehyde and hydroxyl group. However, the exact mechanism for introducing the cyclohexyl group is unclear. Despite this uncertainty, Option D aligns more closely with the functional groups in the target molecule compared to the other options.
