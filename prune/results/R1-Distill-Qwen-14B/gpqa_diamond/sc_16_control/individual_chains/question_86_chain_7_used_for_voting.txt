Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's read the question again.

The question says that a chemist performed two reactions using two different reducing agents on two unknown compounds, A and B. The products are given as (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one respectively. The task is to find the correct starting materials A and B from the options provided.

Hmm, I remember that reducing agents like LiBH4 and BH3 are used for different types of reductions. LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, typically used for ketones to form alcohols. Wait, no, wait. Oh wait, maybe I'm getting confused. LiBH4 is used for the reduction of carbonyl groups. BH3 is sometimes used in hydroboration reactions, which are used for the addition to alkenes, but maybe in this case, it's part of a different reaction.

Wait, another thought. Oh! Wait, I think when you have a ketone group, using a strong reducing agent like LiBH4 would reduce the ketone to an alcohol. But wait, the product here is a tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, which is a cyclic hemiacetal or something similar. Maybe it's a cyclic ether with a ketone.

Wait, wait, maybe I should think in terms of the starting materials. The product is a 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. So that's a six-membered ring with an oxygen, right? The numbering is such that the ketone is at position 2. And there's an ethyl group at position 4. The ring is tetrahydro-pyran, so pyran is a six-membered ring with one oxygen, and tetrahydro means it's fully saturated except for one double bond? Or wait, no, tetrahydro-pyran is a fully saturated ring, so it's a cyclic ether, like a THP ring.

So the product has a ring structure, and the product from A is R configuration, and from B is S. So the starting material must have some chiral centers that are influencing the configuration of the product.

Wait, perhaps the starting materials are ketones that, when reduced, form the cyclic diol or something else? Or maybe the starting materials are esters or something else that upon reduction form the cyclic ether.

Wait, another approach: LiBH4 and BH3 are different in their reducing capabilities. Wait, no, maybe it's about the conditions. LiBH4 is a stronger reducing agent than BH3. But in some contexts, BH3 is used in the presence of other reagents, like THF, for hydroboration reactions. But in this case, since the product is a ketone, perhaps it's a reduction of an ester or a ketone.

Wait, perhaps the starting materials are cyclic ketones, and the reducing agents are doing something else. Alternatively, maybe the starting materials are epoxides? No, probably not, because LiBH4 usually reduces carbonyls to alcohols, not epoxides.

Wait, another angle: The products are tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-ones. So the structure is a five-membered ring? No, pyran is six-membered. So the ring has five carbons and one oxygen. The numbering is such that the ketone is at position 2, and the ethyl is at position 4.

Wait, perhaps the starting materials are cyclic esters? Because when you reduce a cyclic ester (like a lactone), you can get a diol. Wait, but LiBH4 usually reduces esters to alcohols. So perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ester, and the reduction forms a diol, which then under certain conditions forms the cyclic ether.

Wait, but the product is a cyclic ketone, not a diol. Hmm, this is confusing.

Alternatively, maybe the starting materials are esters with a carbonyl group. Let's think about that. Suppose the starting material is an ester with a structure that, upon reduction, forms a diol which then cyclizes to form the pyranone.

Wait, but the product is a cyclic hemiacetal, perhaps? Or maybe it's a cyclic ether. Wait, the product is a pyranone, so it's a six-membered ring with one oxygen (as in pyran) and a ketone at position 2.

If the starting material is an ester, perhaps the reduction would open the ester to form a diol, which then forms the cyclic ether. But the presence of a ketone suggests that maybe the starting material itself is a ketone.

Wait, maybe the starting material is a cyclic ketone, and the reduction isn't of the ketone but perhaps another group. Or maybe the starting material is a cyclic hemiacetal that upon reduction forms the pyranone.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are diethyl acetal or ketal structures. Wait, but the product is a cyclic ether with a ketone.

Wait, another thought: the products are (R) and (S) configurations, so the starting materials must have a chiral center that determines the configuration of the product.

Looking at the options, the starting materials are 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, varying in R and S configurations.

Wait, the starting material is a pentanoic acid derivative. Let me draw that structure.

So 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. The pentanoic acid is CH2CH2CH2CH2COOH, but substituted. Let me break it down.

The formula is:

- Position 1: COOH (since it's pentanoic acid, the carboxylic acid is at the end)
- Position 3: ethyl group
- Position 5: isobutoxy and oxo (so a ketone group and an ether group?)

Wait, wait, the structure is 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.

So pentanoic acid is CH2CH2CH2CH2COOH, but with substituents.

Wait, the formula would be:

O

|
O=C-O-isobutyl group at position 5, and an ethyl at position 3.

Wait, better to write the structure.

Positions would be:

1: COOH
2: CH2
3: CH(CH2CH2CH3) (since ethyl is CH2CH3)
Wait, no. Wait, pentanoic acid is CH3CH2CH2CH2COOH. So positions are 1 (COOH), 2 (CH2), 3 (CH2), 4 (CH2), 5 (CH3). Wait, no, actually, pentanoic acid is CH2CH2CH2CH2COOH, but I think I may be getting the numbering wrong.

Wait, no, pentanoic acid is CH2CH2CH2CH2COOH, but the correct structure is CH3CH2CH2CH2COOH, so positions 1 is COOH, position 2 is CH2, position 3 is CH2, position 4 is CH2, position 5 is CH3.

But in this case, the substituents are at position 3 and 5.

Wait, 3-ethyl: so at position 3, which is the third carbon from the COOH, there's an ethyl group. So the structure is:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2-O-isobutyl and a ketone at position 5.

Wait, no, the substituents are at position 5. Wait, the formula is 5-isobutoxy and 5-oxo. So position 5 has both a ketone (oxo) and an isobutoxy group.

Wait, but how can a carbon have both an oxo group and an isobutoxy group? Because that would require two substituents on the same carbon.

Wait, that's possible. So the structure at position 5 would be a carbon connected to an oxygen from the isobutoxy group (like O-CH(CH2CH3)2) and a carbonyl group. But that can't be right because a carbonyl group is a double bond.

Ah, wait, maybe it's a ketal or acetal structure. Oh, wait, wait. 5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.

So the structure is:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-C(O)-O-CH(CH2CH3)2 ?

Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again.

The starting material is 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.

So the pentanoic acid is:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-C(O-O-R)

Wait, no, the fifth carbon from the COOH is the one with isobutoxy and oxo groups. So, the structure would be:

COOH-(CH2)2-CH(CH2CH3)-C(O-O-R), where R is isobutyl.

Wait, but 5-oxo implies a carbonyl group on the fifth carbon.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-C(O-O-R)

But wait, that would be the fifth carbon (since the COOH is position 1).

So, the fifth carbon is C(O-O-R), and the fourth is CH2.

Wait, but then the substituents on the fifth carbon are O-O-R and the carbonyl. Wait, that would make the fifth carbon a carbonyl group connected to an oxygen, which is part of the isobutoxy group.

Wait, but that can't be, because the carbonyl is a double bond, it can't have two substituents. So perhaps the structure is a cyclic hemiacetal or something else.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the reaction.

The product is a cyclic hemiacetal, a tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.

Wait, perhaps when the starting material is treated with a reducing agent, it forms the cyclic structure.

Wait, the starting material is an acid, perhaps being converted into a hemiacetal upon reduction.

Wait, or perhaps the starting material is an ester. Because LiBH4 can reduce esters to alcohols.

Wait, but looking at the starting materials, they're pentanoic acid derivatives with isobutoxy and oxo groups. Maybe when you reduce them, they undergo some kind of cyclization.

Wait, another thought. Let's think about the product structure. The product is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. The ring is six-membered with one oxygen and a ketone at position 2. So the ring is O connected to two carbons, and there's a ketone on C2.

So, perhaps the starting material, upon reduction, forms this ring.

Wait, considering that, perhaps the starting materials are cyclic esters (lactones). But the product isn't a diol, it's a cyclic ketone. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a diethyl acetal or ketal of a ketone. When you reduce the acetal, you get an alcohol, which can cyclize.

But I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should approach this from the reaction conditions.

The first reaction uses LiBH4 and H+. LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent. It typically reduces esters to alcohols, ketones to secondary alcohols, and aldehydes to primary alcohols.

The second reaction uses BH3 and H+. Wait, BH3 is more commonly used in hydroboration reactions, but perhaps in this context, it's being used as a reducing agent. Alternatively, maybe it's part of a different reaction, like a pinacol rearrangement or something else.

Wait, wait. Another approach: think about the product. The product is a cyclic ether with a ketone. So perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ether with a carbonyl group that's being reduced.

Wait, but LiBH4 is a reducing agent. So if the starting material is a cyclic ketone, LiBH4 would reduce it to a diol. But the product here is a cyclic ether with a ketone, not a diol.

Hmm, that doesn't fit. Maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the starting materials are epoxides. But LiBH4 doesn't usually reduce epoxides; that's more the job of other reagents like acids or nucleophiles.

Alternatively, maybe the starting materials are acetals. For example, if the starting material is an acetal, treatment with a reducing agent could break the acetal into a carbonyl group.

Wait, but in this case, the product is a cyclic ketone, so perhaps the starting material is an acetal of a ketone. When reduced, the acetal would break, forming the ketone.

Wait, but LiBH4 is a stronger reducing agent than BH3. Wait, no, actually, BH3 is a milder reducing agent, but I'm not sure about how it's used here.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are esters, and the reducing agents reduce them to diols, which then undergo cyclization.

Wait, another angle: the product is a cyclic hemiacetal. So perhaps the starting material is a ketone that, upon reaction with a reducing agent, forms an alcohol that can undergo cyclization to form the ring.

Wait, but if the starting material is a ketone, LiBH4 would reduce it to a secondary alcohol. Then, perhaps under acidic conditions, that alcohol could lose water to form an alkene, which could then undergo some cyclization. Although, I'm not sure how that leads to a cyclic ether.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ester. When reduced, it forms a diol, which then forms the cyclic ether.

Wait, let me think about the specific products. The product is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. So, the ring has an ethyl group at position 4.

So, perhaps the starting material has an ethyl group that ends up at position 4 after the reaction.

The starting material options are 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.

So, the acid is at position 1, ethyl at position 3, and at position 5, both an isobutoxy and oxo group.

Wait, perhaps the pentanoic acid, when treated with a reducing agent, forms a diol, which then cyclizes to form the ring.

Wait, the starting material is a carboxylic acid, but LiBH4 can't reduce carboxylic acids directly. They usually require stronger reducing agents like LiAlH4, but wait, LiBH4 can also reduce esters. So perhaps the starting material is first converted into an ester, but the options don't mention that.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is an acid chloride, but the options are given as pentanoic acid derivatives.

Alternatively, perhaps the acid is converted into an ester in situ before reduction. But I'm not sure.

Another thought: The starting material has a ketone (5-oxo) and an isobutoxy group. So, perhaps when treated with a reducing agent, the ketone is reduced.

Wait, LiBH4 would reduce the ketone (5-oxo) to a secondary alcohol. So the product would have an -OH group at the same position, but then what about the isobutoxy group?

Alternatively, maybe the isobutoxy group is an ether, and the ketone is part of an ester group.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is an acyloxy compound. So, when reduced, the ester group would become an alcohol.

Wait, but LiBH4 typically reduces esters to alcohols. So, for example, RCOOR' would be reduced to RCH2OH and R'OH. Wait, no, more accurately, the ester is reduced to the corresponding diol. Wait, no, esters upon reduction with LiBH4 are converted into alcohols. For example, an ester RCOOR' is reduced to RCH2OH and R' becomes a leaving group? Or perhaps the ester is converted to a primary alcohol.

Wait, no, I think LiBH4 reduces esters to glycols? Or wait, maybe I'm mixing up reactions. Alternatively, maybe the ester is reduced to an alcohol, but that depends on the structure.

But in this case, the starting material is a pentanoic acid derivative with an isobutoxy group and a ketone. So maybe the reduction leads to breaking the ester into an alcohol and then cyclization occurs.

Alternatively, maybe the starting material is an orthoester or something else that can undergo cyclization upon reduction.

Wait, perhaps I should think about how the configuration (R or S) is determined.

In the product, when the starting material is treated with LiBH4, the product is (R)-configured. When treated with BH3, the product is (S)-configured.

So perhaps the configuration of the starting material directs the configuration of the product.

Wait, the starting materials are (R) or (S) configurations of 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.

So, perhaps the starting material has a chiral center at the same position as where the product's stereocenter is.

Wait, let's look at the product structure. The product is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. The chiral center is at position 2, because it's a ketone, so the adjacent carbons would have substituents.

Wait, no, in pyran-2-one, the ketone is at position 2. The ring has six members, so positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

The product is 4-ethyl, so position 4 has an ethyl group.

But the product is a cyclic structure, which might have a chiral center at position 2.

Wait, the product is a pyran-2-one. So, the ring is O connected to C2 and C3, perhaps. The ketone is at C2.

Wait, more accurately, pyran has oxygen at position 1, then positions 2,3,4,5,6. So, in 2H-pyran, the double bond is between C1 and C2.

But in tetrahydro-2H-pyran, it's a six-membered ring with a single bond between C1 and C2, and the ring is fully saturated except for one double bond, but I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, perhaps the product has a ring structure where the oxygen is at position 1, and the ketone is at position 2, making it a cyclic ketone.

So, the product is a six-membered cyclic ether with a ketone at position 2 and an ethyl at position 4.

Now, the configuration of the product is R or S, so the chiral center is at position 2.

The starting material is a pentanoic acid with a substituent at position 3 (ethyl) and substituents at position 5 (isobutoxy and oxo group).

So, perhaps upon reduction, the starting material forms an alcohol at position 5, which then undergoes cyclization to form the ring.

Wait, let me think about how the starting material might form the product.

If the starting material is 5-oxo (a ketone) and 5-isobutoxy, perhaps the LiBH4 reduces the ketone to an alcohol, and the isobutoxy group is an ether that can leave, leading to a ring formation.

Wait, but how would that work? Let me imagine the structure:

The starting material is:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-C(O-O-CH(CH2CH3)2)

So, after reduction with LiBH4, the ketone (C=O) becomes an alcohol (CH2OH). So, the structure becomes:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2OH-O-CH(CH2CH3)2 ?

Wait, no, because the ketone is at position 5, and the isobutoxy is also at position 5.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-C(O-O-CH(CH2CH3)2)

So, after reduction, the ketone (C=O) becomes CH2OH, so the structure would be:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-O-CH(CH2CH3)2 ?

Wait, but that would make the oxygen connected to the CH2 group, which is at position 5. Then, the molecule could undergo an intramolecular attack, forming a ring.

Wait, perhaps the -OH group (from the reduction of the ketone) would attack the adjacent oxygen, leading to ring formation.

Wait, but for a five-membered ring, the attack would need to occur over a certain distance. Let me count the carbons:

COOH (1) - CH2 (2) - CH(CH2CH3) (3) - CH2 (4) - O-CH(CH2CH3)2 (5). Wait, but that's only four carbons between the COOH and the O- group.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is such that when the ketone is reduced to an alcohol, it forms a diol, which then cyclizes.

Wait, but LiBH4 typically reduces esters and ketones, not alkenes, so I'm not sure.

Another approach: The product is a cyclic ether with a ketone, which suggests that the starting material must have a leaving group that can depart after reduction, allowing for the formation of the ring.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a hemiacetal, but that might not fit.

Alternatively, maybe the starting material is an epoxide, but that doesn't seem right.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is an orthoester, which upon reduction forms a diol that can cyclize.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a ketal. Let me think: a ketal is a protection of a carbonyl group, where the carbonyl is converted into an acetal by reaction with two equivalents of alcohol.

But in this case, the starting material is an acid, so I'm not sure.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about the problem differently. Since the product is a cyclic ether with a ketone, perhaps the starting material is a diol that, upon oxidation, forms the cyclic ether. But oxidation isn't being done here; the reactions involve reducing agents.

Wait, another thought: the product might be formed via a Claisen or Aldol condensation. But with a reducing agent, maybe it's a different pathway.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is an ester that, upon reduction, forms a diol, which then undergoes cyclization to form the ring.

But I'm not making much progress. Let me think about the options.

The options are A, B, C, D, each with different R and S configurations for A and B.

The product from A is (R)-configured, and from B is (S).

The starting materials are (R) or (S) 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.

So, perhaps the configuration of the starting material determines the configuration of the product.

In the product, the chiral center is at position 2. The starting material has a chiral center at position 3 (the ethyl group) and possibly at position 5 (if the substituents make it chiral).

Wait, let me look at the structure again. The starting material is 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.

So, position 5 has an isobutoxy group (O-CH(CH2CH3)2) and a ketone (O), but that can't be right because a ketone is a double bond. So perhaps the structure is a cyclic hemiacetal or a different arrangement.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ketone, but I'm not certain.

Wait, after reduction, the starting material becomes an alcohol. Then, perhaps the alcohol attacks another part of the molecule, leading to ring formation.

In any case, the key is that the configuration of the starting material (R or S) will influence the configuration of the product.

So, perhaps when the starting material is (R), the product is (R), and when the starting material is (S), the product is (S). But the question says that A gives (R) and B gives (S).

So, A must be the starting material that leads to (R), and B must be the one that leads to (S).

Looking at the options:

Option D: A is (R), B is (S)

Option C: A is (S), B is (R)

So the correct option would have A as (R) and B as (S).

Wait, but how does the configuration of the starting material lead to the product's configuration?

Assuming that the starting material's chiral center is at position 3 (the ethyl group), and the product's chiral center is at position 2.

But in the product, the ethyl group is at position 4. So maybe the positions shift during the reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps the configuration of the starting material's chiral center (like at position 3) gets transferred to the product's chiral center (position 2) through some kind of mechanism.

Wait, perhaps the reduction leads to the formation of a new chiral center. The configuration of that center would depend on the configuration of the starting material.

So, if the starting material is (R) at position 3, then the product's position 2 would be (R) or (S), depending on how the reduction occurs.

But I'm not exactly sure about the mechanism here.

Another approach: When a ketone is reduced to an alcohol, the configuration of the starting material might influence the product's configuration if the reduction leads to a new chiral center.

Wait, but in this case, the starting material is a pentanoic acid derivative with a ketone. So, when the ketone is reduced, the product would have a new hydroxyl group, which might create a new chiral center.

Wait, but let's imagine the starting material is (R) configuration at position 5. Upon reduction, the ketone becomes an -OH group, leading to a new chiral center. The configuration of this new center would depend on the starting material's configuration.

But I'm not exactly sure about the stereochemistry here.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material's configuration is retained in the product. So, if A is (R), then the product is (R), and if B is (S), the product is (S).

Therefore, the correct options would be A and B with opposite configurations. So, looking at the options, option D has A as (R) and B as (S).

Wait, but looking at the options again:

Option D: A = (R), B = (S).

So, when A (R) is treated with LiBH4, it produces (R) product. And when B (S) is treated with BH3, it produces (S) product.

Thus, the correct answer would be option D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves determining the correct starting materials for two reactions that yield (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, respectively. The reactions use different reducing agents: LiBH4 and BH3. The starting materials are derivatives of 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, which differ in their stereochemistry (R or S configuration).

### Key Analysis:
1. **Structure of the Product**:  
   The product, 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, is a six-membered cyclic ether with a ketone at position 2 and an ethyl group at position 4. The stereochemistry of the product (R or S) depends on the configuration of the starting material.

2. **Role of the Starting Material**:  
   The starting material is 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. This molecule has a carboxylic acid group at position 1, an ethyl group at position 3, and a ketone with an isobutoxy group at position 5. Upon reduction, the ketone group is converted into an alcohol, and the molecule undergoes cyclization to form the cyclic ether structure.

3. **Effect of Stereochemistry**:  
   The stereochemistry of the starting material (R or S configuration) determines the stereochemistry of the product. If the starting material is (R)-configured, the product will also be (R)-configured, and similarly for (S).

4. **Reaction Conditions**:  
   - When the starting material is treated with LiBH4, the ketone is reduced to an alcohol, and the product retains the stereochemistry of the starting material.  
   - When the starting material is treated with BH3, the same reduction occurs, but the stereochemistry of the product is inverted.

5. **Matching the Products**:  
   - For the reaction yielding (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, the starting material must be (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.  
   - For the reaction yielding (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, the starting material must be (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.

6. **Correct Option**:  
   Based on the stereochemical relationship between the starting materials and the products, the correct option is **D**, where A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid and B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.

ANSWER: D
