Okay, so I have this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on particle physics, but let's see if I can figure this out.

The question is asking for the mean decay distance of a meson X. The given parameters are the production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are A to D, all in units of 10^-15 or 10^-16 meters.

Wait, mean decay distance... I remember that particles don't live forever; they decay after some time. The mean lifetime is related to the width of the particle, right? The formula I think is τ = ħ / Γ. But wait, decay distance, not lifetime. Oh right, the mean decay distance is the mean lifetime multiplied by the particle's velocity. So, d = τ * v.

But wait, how do I find the velocity? I guess I can use the relativistic energy equations. The production energy is given, E_X is 8 GeV. The mass is 1.2 GeV, so the rest mass is much smaller than the energy. So the particle is moving at a high speed.

First, maybe I should calculate the velocity v. Let's think about energy. The total energy E is related to the rest mass and momentum by E² = (pc)² + (m c²)². So, solving for p, the momentum: p = sqrt( (E/c²)² - (m c²)² ) / (c). Wait, no, let me get the units right. Let's write it as E² = (pc)^2 + (m c²)^2. So, p = sqrt( (E^2 - m^2 c^4) ) / c²? Hmm, maybe I should approach it differently.

Wait, E is 8 GeV. m is 1.2 GeV/c². So E is much larger than mc², so we can approximate. Let's see, E ≈ pc for high energy particles, but let's see.

But perhaps a better approach is to calculate the gamma factor. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, given by gamma = E / (m c²). Here, E is 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV/c². So gamma = 8 / 1.2 ≈ 6.6667.

Then, the velocity v can be found using gamma. Remember that gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So, we can solve for v.

But wait, maybe using beta instead. Beta is v/c. And beta squared is 1 - 1/gamma². So, beta = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²). Let me compute that.

Gamma is approximately 6.6667. So 1/gamma² is 1/(44.444) ≈ 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. Square root of that is about 0.9887. So beta is roughly 0.9887, which means v ≈ 0.9887c.

Wait, maybe I should compute it more accurately. Let me compute gamma squared:

gamma = 8 /1.2 = 20/3 ≈6.6666667.

Gamma squared is (20/3)^2 = 400/9 ≈44.444444.

1/gamma² is 9/400=0.0225.

So 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775.

Square root of 0.9775: let me compute that. Let me find sqrt(0.9775). Hmm, 0.9887^2 is approximately 0.9775. So yes, beta is about 0.9887.

So v ≈0.9887c.

Now, to find the mean decay distance d = v * tau. Tau is the mean lifetime, which is hbar over the width. Remember that Γ is the decay width, which is related to the lifetime by tau = ħ / Γ.

Wait, but the units. Let me make sure I get the units right.

Gamma is given in MeV. Let me convert everything to SI units.

Gamma_X = 320 MeV. 1 eV is 1.602e-19 joules. So 320 MeV is 320e6 eV. So 320e6 * 1.602e-19 = 5.1264e-11 J.

Tau is hbar / Gamma. hbar is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So tau = hbar / Gamma = (1.0545718e-34 J·s) / (5.1264e-11 J) = approximately 2.056e-24 seconds.

Wait, let me compute that more accurately.

1.0545718e-34 / 5.1264e-11 = (1.0545718 /5.1264) * 1e-23.

1.0545718 /5.1264 ≈0.2056.

So tau ≈0.2056e-23 s? Wait, 1e-34 / 1e-11 is 1e-23. So yes, 0.2056e-23 s is 2.056e-24 s.

Wait, no, 0.2056e-23 is 2.056e-24. Right.

So tau ≈ 2.056e-24 seconds.

Now, the velocity v is 0.9887c. c is about 3e8 m/s.

So v ≈ 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s ≈ 2.966e8 m/s.

Wait, more accurately: 0.9887 * 3 = 2.9661, so v ≈2.9661e8 m/s.

Now, the mean decay distance d = v * tau.

So d = (2.9661e8 m/s) * (2.056e-24 s) = let's compute that.

2.9661e8 * 2.056e-24 = (2.9661 * 2.056) * 1e-16.

Compute 2.9661 * 2.056.

Let me compute 3 * 2.056 is 6.168, but since it's 2.9661, which is about 3 * 0.9887, so 2.9661 =3 * 0.9887.

So 2.9661 * 2.056 = 3 * 0.9887 * 2.056.

Compute 3 * 2.056=6.168. Then multiply by 0.9887.

6.168 * 0.9887 ≈ let's see: 6 * 0.9887 is 5.9322, and 0.168 * 0.9887≈0.1664. So total ≈5.9322 +0.1664=6.0986.

So approximately 6.0986e-16 meters.

Wait, but looking at the options:

Option A is 5.0223e-16 m.

Option D is 4.0655e-16 m.

Hmm, my calculation gives about 6.098e-16, which isn't matching any of the options. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation of beta. Let me check that again.

Gamma is 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 6.6666667.

So gamma squared is (20/3)^2=400/9≈44.44444.

1/gamma^2 = 9/400=0.0225.

1 - 0.0225 =0.9775.

sqrt(0.9775)=0.9887. That's correct.

So beta is 0.9887, v= ~0.9887c, which is correct.

Hmm, then where's the mistake?

Wait, let me recheck the calculation of tau.

Gamma is 320 MeV. Let me make sure to convert it properly.

Gamma = 320 MeV = 320e6 eV.

hbar is 6.5823e-25 GeV·s. Oh! Wait a second! Because using hbar in GeV·s might be easier for the calculation since E is in GeV and Gamma is in MeV.

Wait, let me think again. Because when working with natural units where c=1, the width is in GeV, and hbar is about 6.5823e-25 GeV·s.

So tau = ħ / Γ. But Γ must be in GeV.

Gamma is 320 MeV = 0.32 GeV.

So, tau = (6.5823e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) ) = (6.5823e-25 / 0.32) s.

Calculating that: 6.5823 /0.32 ≈20.5697.

So tau ≈20.5697e-25 s = 2.05697e-24 s.

Ah, same as before. So that part is correct.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in the calculation of decay distance.

Wait, the decay distance is v * tau.

v=0.9887c =0.9887 *3e8 m/s= 2.9661e8 m/s.

tau=2.056e-24 s.

So d=2.9661e8 m/s * 2.056e-24 s = (2.9661 * 2.056) * 1e-16 m.

Wait, let me compute 2.9661 *2.056.

2.9661 *2=5.9322.

2.9661*0.056=approx 0.16726.

So total is about 6.09946e-16 m.

So d≈6.099e-16 meters.

But none of the options match this. The options are 5e-16, 4e-15, 5e-15, 4e-16.

Wait, did I make a mistake in units?

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation of v. Let me check.

Wait, E is 8 GeV, m=1.2 GeV/c².

E² = (pc)^2 + (m c²)^2.

So, E=8 GeV, m c²=1.2 GeV.

So, E² = (pc)^2 + (1.2)^2.

So, (pc)^2 = (8)^2 - (1.2)^2 =64 -1.44=62.56.

So, pc= sqrt(62.56)=7.91 GeV.

p=7.91 GeV /c.

Then, p = gamma m v.

Wait, but gamma is E/(m c²) =8/1.2=6.6667.

Alternatively, beta = v/c = (pc)/(E). Because E= gamma m c².

Wait, another approach: beta = (pc)/(E).

Because E=gamma m c^2, and pc= gamma m v, so beta= (pc)/(E) = (gamma m v c)/(gamma m c²) )= v/(c) = beta.

So beta = (pc)/E.

So, pc is 7.91 GeV.

E is 8 GeV.

So beta=7.91/8=0.98875. Which is the same as before.

So v=0.98875c, same as before.

So v is correct.

Hmm, perhaps I miscalculated the product v * tau.

Wait, let me compute 2.9661e8 m/s *2.056e-24 s.

Calculating 2.9661e8 *2.056e-24 = (2.9661 *2.056) *1e(8-24) = (6.099) *1e-16 =6.099e-16 m.

But the options don't have this. So I must have messed up somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the decay width is Γ in MeV, but I used it in GeV. Let me check.

Gamma is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. So yes, correct.

Wait, another thought: the formula for the mean decay length is d= (c * tau) * beta.

Because v=beta c, so d= beta c * tau.

Wait, that might be a better way to write it.

So, d= beta * c * tau.

So, tau is 2.056e-24 s.

c is 3e8 m/s.

beta is 0.9887.

So, c * tau =3e8 m/s *2.056e-24 s =6.168e-16 m.

Then multiply by beta: 6.168e-16 *0.9887 ≈6.1e-16 m.

Same result as before.

Hmm, none of the options are close to 6e-16. The options are A:5.0223e-16, B:4.0655e-15, C:5.0223e-15, D:4.0655e-16.

Wait, none match. So perhaps I made a mistake in calculating beta.

Wait, perhaps I should use a more precise calculation for beta.

Let me compute beta = sqrt(1 - (m c^2)^2 / E^2).

Wait, m c^2 =1.2 GeV, E=8 GeV.

So (m c²)^2 / E² = (1.44)/(64) =0.0225.

So sqrt(1-0.0225)=sqrt(0.9775)=approx 0.9887.

But let's calculate it more accurately.

0.9775^0.5. Let me compute sqrt(0.9775).

We can write 0.9775 = 0.9887^2 approximately.

Wait, let me compute 0.9887^2: 0.9887 * 0.9887.

= (0.98 *0.98) + (0.98 *0.0087)*2 + (0.0087)^2.

Wait, maybe a better way: 0.9887 *0.9887.

0.9887 * 0.9887:

Let me compute it as (1 - 0.0113)^2 = 1 - 2*0.0113 + (0.0113)^2.

= 1 - 0.0226 + 0.00012769.

=0.97752769.

But 0.9775 is the number under the square root. So the square root is about 0.9887.

So beta is approximately 0.9887.

Hmm, so that part is correct.

Another thought: perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of tau. Let me recheck.

Gamma is 320 MeV. I converted that to GeV as 0.32 GeV. Tau = hbar / Gamma.

hbar in GeV·s is approximately 6.5823e-25 GeV·s.

So tau = 6.5823e-25 / 0.32 GeV.

Which is 6.5823 /0.32 = approx 20.5696875 → 20.5696875e-25 s = 2.05696875e-24 s.

That's correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem isn't with the calculation but with the approach.

Wait, another thought: maybe the decay width is given as the total decay width, and the mean lifetime is 1/(Gamma), but perhaps in the formula, the width is Gamma, and the lifetime is ħ/(Gamma).

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, but sometimes, the decay width is given in MeV, and perhaps we need to consider that it's the natural line width, but I think we handled that correctly.

Wait, maybe the problem is that the production energy E is 8 GeV, but the mass is 1.2 GeV. So the meson is produced at rest? No, that's impossible because E=8 GeV is much larger than the rest mass. So the meson is moving at high speed.

Wait, wait, perhaps I should compute the velocity using another approach.

E = gamma m c².

So gamma = E/(m c²) = 8/1.2 =6.6667.

From gamma, beta is sqrt(1 - (1/gamma)^2).

Wait, 1/gamma is 0.15, so (1/gamma)^2=0.0225. So 1 -0.0225=0.9775. Beta is sqrt(0.9775)=0.9887. Same as before.

Hmm.

Let me check the calculation for v * tau again.

v = 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s =2.9661e8 m/s.

tau=2.056e-24 s.

d=2.9661e8 * 2.056e-24 = ?

Compute 2.9661e8 *2.056e-24.

2.9661 *2.056 = let's compute accurately.

2 * 2.9661 =5.9322.

0.056 *2.9661=0.16726.

Total 5.9322 +0.16726=6.09946.

So 6.09946e-16 meters.

But none of the options match. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach. Maybe the mean decay distance is calculated differently.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the decay width is given as the total width, but the mean lifetime is 1/(Gamma), but perhaps in particle physics, the decay width is related to the lifetime via Gamma = ħ / tau.

Wait, yes: because Gamma is the total decay width, which is the energy width. The uncertainty principle says Delta E * Delta t ≈ ħ. So Delta E is Gamma, so Delta t is tau, so Gamma * tau ≈ ħ → tau ≈ ħ / Gamma.

So yeah, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should use a more precise value for beta.

Wait, let me compute beta more accurately.

Beta = sqrt(1 - (m c²/E)^2) = sqrt(1 - (1.2/8)^2) = sqrt(1 - (0.15)^2) = sqrt(1 - 0.0225) = sqrt(0.9775).

So, let's compute sqrt(0.9775) with more precision.

0.9887^2 =0.97752769, which is a bit more than 0.9775. So beta is just a bit less than 0.9887. Let me compute it more precisely.

We can write x = sqrt(0.9775).

x^2 =0.9775.

We can calculate x:

Let me try 0.9887^2 =0.97752769.

But 0.9775 is a bit less, so x is a bit less than 0.9887.

Let me calculate (0.9887 - delta)^2 =0.9775.

(0.9887)^2 - 2*0.9887 * delta + delta^2 =0.9775.

0.97752769 - 1.9774 delta + delta^2 =0.9775.

So 0.97752769 -0.9775 =1.9774 delta - delta^2.

Left side: 0.00002769 =1.9774 delta (approx) → delta ≈0.00002769/1.9774≈1.4e-5.

So x ≈0.9887 - 0.000014 ≈0.988686.

So beta is approximately 0.988686.

So v =0.988686 *3e8 m/s=2.966058e8 m/s.

Tau is 2.056e-24 s.

So d=2.966058e8 *2.056e-24.

Compute 2.966058e8 * 2.056e-24 = (2.966058 * 2.056) * 1e-16.

2.966058 *2.056= let me compute accurately.

2.966058 * 2 =5.932116.

2.966058 * 0.056 = 0.167299.

Adding them: 5.932116 +0.167299=6.099415.

So d=6.099415e-16 meters.

No change, same as before.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the decay width is given in the problem in MeV, but I used it as the total width, but perhaps in the formula, it's the natural line width or something else. No, I think that's correct.

Wait, another thought: the decay width is given in MeV, but the production energy is 8 GeV. Maybe I should compute the energy in the same units. Wait, E is 8 GeV, m is1.2 GeV, so that's fine.

Alternative approach: perhaps I should compute the decay length using the formula involving the mass, width, and energy.

Wait, I remember that the decay length can be estimated using d = c * beta gamma * tau.

Wait, beta gamma is gamma * beta.

Gamma is 6.6667.

So beta gamma=6.6667 *0.9887 ≈6.6667 *0.9887= approx 6.596.

Wait, 6.6667 *0.9887:

6 *0.9887=5.9322, 0.6667 *0.9887≈0.658.

So 5.9322 +0.658=6.5902.

So beta gamma≈6.5902.

Then tau = hbar / Gamma.

Gamma is 320 MeV=0.32 GeV.

So tau=6.5823e-25 GeV s / 0.32 GeV=2.05697e-24 s.

So v = beta c.

So c is 3e8 m/s.

So decay length d= beta gamma c tau.

Wait, wait. Let me think.

Wait, another formula: the decay length is (gamma beta c tau) * (c tau) ?

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think.

The proper formula for the decay length is L = gamma * beta * c * tau.

Yes, because the lifetime in the lab frame is gamma times the proper lifetime (tau0 = hbar / (Gamma)), so L = v * gamma tau0.

v is beta c, so L = beta c gamma tau0.

But tau0 is hbar / Gamma, so:

L = beta c gamma (hbar / Gamma).

Alternatively, since Gamma = hbar / tau0, and tau = gamma tau0.

So L = v * tau = beta c * gamma tau0.

Wait, but the way I computed it before was v * tau.

But perhaps the proper way is:

L = gamma * beta * c * tau.

Where tau is the mean lifetime, which is tau0 * gamma.

But tau0 is hbar / Gamma.

So tau = gamma tau0.

So L = v * tau = beta c * gamma tau0.

But since tau0 = hbar/Gamma, L = beta c gamma (hbar / Gamma).

Wait, but in any case, perhaps the formula I used earlier is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is L = (c * tau) * beta gamma.

Which would be the same as beta gamma c tau.

Wait, let me compute beta gamma c tau.

Beta gamma is 6.5902.

c =3e8 m/s.

tau=2.056e-24 s.

So 6.5902 *3e8 m/s *2.056e-24 s.

Calculate that:

6.5902 * 3 =19.7706.

19.7706 * 2.056 = approx 40.66.

Wait, 19.7706 *2=39.5412, 19.7706 *0.056=1.109.

Total: 39.5412 +1.109≈40.6502.

Multiply by 1e8 m/s *1e-24 s = 1e-16 m.

So L≈40.65e-16 m =4.065e-15 m.

Wait, that's option B:4.0655e-15 m.

Wait, but earlier calculation via v tau gave me about 6e-16, but now via beta gamma c tau, I get 4.065e-15.

Hmm, a big difference. So where's the mistake?

Ah! I think I see the confusion. The formula I used earlier is d= v * tau. But perhaps I should be using the lab frame time, which is gamma times the proper time.

Wait, no. Because in the lab frame, the lifetime is longer by gamma, but the velocity is higher.

Wait, let me think again. The mean lifetime in the lab frame is gamma * tau0, where tau0 is the proper lifetime (hbar/Gamma).

So, the mean decay distance is v * gamma tau0.

Because the lab frame lifetime is longer, but the velocity is higher.

So, d= v * gamma tau0.

Which is same as beta c * gamma tau0.

Which is same as beta gamma c tau0.

Tau0 is hbar / Gamma.

So, d= beta gamma c (hbar / Gamma).

Wait, perhaps that's the correct formula.

So, let's compute that.

Beta gamma is approx 6.5902.

c=3e8 m/s.

hbar is 6.5823e-25 GeV s.

Gamma is 0.32 GeV.

So, putting it all together:

d=6.5902 *3e8 m/s * (6.5823e-25 GeV s)/ 0.32 GeV.

Let me compute the units first.

GeV cancels out.

s cancels with s in denominator.

So units: m/s * (s) → m.

So,

d=6.5902 *3e8 *6.5823e-25 /0.32.

Compute the numbers:

6.5902 *3=19.7706.

19.7706 *6.5823e-25 = approx 6.5902 * 6.5823 ≈43.45; 43.45e-25.

Wait, 6.5902 *6.5823 = approx 43.45.

So, 43.45e-25.

Then divide by 0.32:

43.45e-25 /0.32=135.78e-25=1.3578e-23.

Multiply by 3e8: 3e8 * 1.3578e-23 =4.0734e-15 meters.

Ah! So d≈4.07e-15 meters.

Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m and option C is 5.02e-15. So our calculation gives approximately 4.07e-15, which matches option B.

Wait, but earlier when I used v * tau, I got 6e-16. So what's the discrepancy?

Because in the v * tau approach, I used tau= hbar/Gamma, which is the proper time. But in the lab frame, the lifetime is longer by gamma. So the correct approach should be to use the lab frame lifetime.

So, tau_lab = gamma * tau_proper.

So, d= v * tau_lab = v * gamma tau_proper.

Which is the same as beta gamma c tau_proper.

So, that gives d= beta gamma c (hbar/Gamma).

Hence, the correct calculation gives 4.07e-15 m, which is option B.

Wait, but why did the earlier method give a different answer? Because in the first approach, I used tau= hbar/Gamma (tau_proper), but in reality, the time in the lab frame is gamma times longer.

So, the correct formula is d= v * gamma tau_proper.

So, let's recompute using that.

d= v * gamma * tau_proper.

v=beta c.

tau_proper= hbar/Gamma.

So,

d= beta c * gamma * (hbar / Gamma).

Which is same as beta gamma c (hbar/Gamma).

Which brings us to the same result as before, 4.07e-15 m.

So the correct answer should be option B:4.0655e-15 m.

But wait, looking back, the options are:

A) 5.0223e-16

B)4.0655e-15

C)5.0223e-15

D)4.0655e-16

So the correct answer is option B.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the mean decay distance of the meson resonance \( X \), we use the formula for the mean decay distance:

\[
d = \beta \gamma c \tau
\]

where:
- \( \beta = v/c \) is the velocity of the particle as a fraction of the speed of light,
- \( \gamma = \frac{E}{m c^2} \) is the Lorentz factor,
- \( c \) is the speed of light,
- \( \tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma} \) is the mean lifetime, with \( \Gamma \) being the decay width.

### Step 1: Calculate \( \gamma \)
The production energy \( E_X = 8 \, \text{GeV} \) and the mass \( m_X = 1.2 \, \text{GeV}/c^2 \). The Lorentz factor is:

\[
\gamma = \frac{E}{m c^2} = \frac{8}{1.2} = 6.6667
\]

### Step 2: Calculate \( \beta \)
The velocity \( \beta \) is related to \( \gamma \) by:

\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}}
\]

Substituting \( \gamma = 6.6667 \):

\[
\gamma^2 = \left(\frac{20}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{400}{9} \approx 44.4444
\]
\[
\frac{1}{\gamma^2} = \frac{9}{400} = 0.0225
\]
\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - 0.0225} = \sqrt{0.9775} \approx 0.9887
\]

### Step 3: Calculate \( \tau \)
The decay width \( \Gamma_X = 320 \, \text{MeV} = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \). The mean lifetime \( \tau \) is:

\[
\tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma}
\]

Using \( \hbar = 6.5823 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV} \cdot \text{s} \):

\[
\tau = \frac{6.5823 \times 10^{-25}}{0.32} \approx 2.056 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate \( \beta \gamma \)
The product \( \beta \gamma \) is:

\[
\beta \gamma = \beta \cdot \gamma = 0.9887 \cdot 6.6667 \approx 6.5902
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the mean decay distance \( d \)
The mean decay distance is:

\[
d = \beta \gamma c \tau
\]

Substituting \( \beta \gamma = 6.5902 \), \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), and \( \tau = 2.056 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s} \):

\[
d = 6.5902 \cdot 3 \times 10^8 \cdot 2.056 \times 10^{-24}
\]

First, calculate \( 6.5902 \cdot 3 = 19.7706 \), then:

\[
19.7706 \cdot 2.056 = 40.6502
\]

Thus:

\[
d = 40.6502 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{m} = 4.06502 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}
\]

### Final Answer
The mean decay distance is approximately \( 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \), which corresponds to **Option B**.
