Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to think through it.

The question is about 1-bromobenzene-2-d being treated with NaNH2 in condensed ammonia solvent. I need to find out how many possible organic products there are.

Wait, wait. Wait, wait. So first, the compound is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. Hmm. Wait, what's that structure? Oh, benzene ring with a bromine on carbon 1 and a deuterium on carbon 2? Or wait, maybe it's 1-bromo-2-deutero-benzene? So the benzene ring has Br at position 1 and D (deuterium) at position 2.

So, the structure is a benzene ring where one of the carbons (let's say carbon 1) has a Br substituent, and the adjacent carbon (carbon 2) has a deuterium. So, it's para to position 3 or something? Wait, no, wait. Benzene is a ring, so positions 1, 2 are adjacent. So it's a bromine and a deuterium on adjacent carbons.

Now, the reaction is with NaNH2 in condensed ammonia. I remember that NaNH2 is a strong base, often used in deprotonation reactions. But in this case, the solvent is condensed ammonia, which is a liquid ammonia solvent. So, in such conditions, what kind of reactions happen?

Wait, wait. I think when we have benzene rings with substituents, especially deuterium, and we treat them with a strong base like NaNH2, it's a possibility of elimination or maybe some kind of substitution.

Wait, but the starting material is 1-bromo-2-deutero-benzene. So, the Br is at position 1, D at 2.

Wait, if we have Br in position 1, and D in 2, what's the structure? So, benzene ring with Br on C1 and D on C2. So, the adjacent positions.

In such a case, when NaNH2 is used, which is a strong base, maybe it abstracts protons (or deuterium?) to induce elimination or some aromatic substitution.

Wait, but wait. The starting compound is bromobenzene with a deuterium on the adjacent carbon. So, it's an aromatic compound, but perhaps the reaction is about elimination or forming some kind of ring contraction or expansion. No, probably substitution.

Wait, but in aromatic substitution, especially electrophilic or nucleophilic. Wait, NaNH2 is a strong base. So, perhaps it's a deprotonation reaction.

Wait, but the D is on the adjacent carbon. So, if the base can abstract a proton, but the adjacent carbon has a D, which is a heavy isotope of H. Deprotonation would be easier where? Let's see.

Wait, for each hydrogen/deuterium, the acidity is different. Deuterium is less acidic than protium because the bond strength is higher. So, the H atoms adjacent to Br and the D might have varying acidity.

Wait, but in this molecule, the Br is at C1, D at C2. So, the other Hs on the ring are on C3, C4, C5, and C6.

Wait, but wait. When a benzene ring has a substituent like Br, it can activate certain positions for substitution. Br is a meta director. So, in an electrophilic substitution, the incoming group would go to the meta position relative to Br. But here, the reaction isn't electrophilic substitution because we're using a strong base.

Wait a second, maybe this is a nucleophilic aromatic substitution? But for that, the ring needs to be activated towards nucleophilic attack, which usually requires electron-withdrawing groups. Br is slightly deactivating but ortho/para directing. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is elimination, but in aromatic systems, elimination is tricky. Wait, but wait, another option: maybe the base abstracts a proton adjacent to Br, leading to some kind of ring expansion or contraction. Or perhaps, more likely, deprotonation to form a benzene ring with a negative charge, which then might undergo some reaction.

Wait, but benzene is aromatic, so deprotonation would generate a cyclohexenide ion, which is antiaromatic. That's not favorable, so maybe this doesn't happen. Alternatively, maybe the D is on a position that's more acidic, so the base abstracts a D from the adjacent carbon?

Wait, no, wait. The compound is 1-bromo-2-deutero-benzene. So, the D is attached to C2, which is adjacent to C1 (Br). So, the structure is Br on C1, D on C2, and other positions (3,4,5,6) have Hs.

Wait, NaNH2 is a strong base, so it will abstract a proton from the benzene ring. But where?

Wait, in aromatic rings, deprotonation typically occurs at positions that are activated towards deprotonation. The substituents can influence the acidity of the protons. For example, electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the adjacent protons.

But Br is an electron-withdrawing group, so the protons ortho and para to Br are more acidic than the others.

Wait, in this case, Br is on C1. So, the ortho positions are C2 and C6. C2 has a D, so the other ortho position is C6. The para position is C4.

So, the most acidic protons would be on C2 (which is D here) and C6. But wait, since C2 is D, the H isn't present. So, the next most acidic would be C6.

Wait, but wait. In the ring, the Br is activating for deprotonation? Hmm, I'm a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the base will abstract a proton from the ring, leading to a deprotonated benzene ring, which could then undergo some kind of elimination or substitution.

Wait, but in the case of 1-bromo-2-deutero-benzene, if the base abstracts a proton from C3, which is adjacent to C2 (D), what happens?

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a ring expansion. Wait, I recall that benzene rings with substituents can undergo elimination to form cycloheptatriene rings, but I'm not sure about the specifics.

Wait, maybe it's a case of dehydrohalogenation. Hmm, but Br is on the ring. So, perhaps it's a Fittig reaction? No, Fittig is when two aryl halides couple in the presence of Na metal, producing biphenyl.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction forms a benzene ring with a leaving group (Br) and another substituent (D), and upon deprotonation, forms a diradical or something, but I'm not quite sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the possible products.

So, the starting material is 1-bromo-2-deutero-benzene. When treated with a strong base like NaNH2, maybe it deprotonates a position, generating a benzene ring with a negative charge, which could then lose the Br- as a leaving group, leading to a ring contraction.

Wait, but benzene is a six-membered ring. If a ring contraction occurs, it would form a five-membered ring, which is cyclopentadienyl. But I'm not sure how that would happen.

Wait, another approach: when a benzene ring with a strong electron-withdrawing group (like nitro) and a good leaving group (like Br) is treated with a strong base, it can undergo elimination to form a cycloheptatriene (a seven-membered ring with three double bonds). But I'm not certain if that's applicable here.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a simple dehydrohalogenation. But in aromatic systems, that's not straightforward. Wait, perhaps the Br is eliminated, but I don't see how that would form a new product.

Alternatively, maybe the base abstracts a proton adjacent to Br, leading to a benzyne intermediate. Benzyne is a highly strained triple bond in the ring, which can undergo various reactions.

Wait, benzyne formation typically involves the loss of HX from a dihalobenzene. For example, o-dihalobenzenes can lose two X groups (like Br-) to form benzyne. But in this case, we have only one Br and a D adjacent. So, maybe that's not the case.

Wait, but wait. Maybe the reaction is a substitution. If the Br is replaced by NH2, but under what conditions? NaNH2 is a source of NH2- ions. So, perhaps it's a nucleophilic aromatic substitution.

But for that to happen, the ring must be activated towards nucleophilic attack. Electron-withdrawing groups activate the ring for this. Since Br is an EWG, maybe the ring is activated enough for substitution.

In nucleophilic aromatic substitution, the nucleophile attacks the ring at a position activated by the EWG. So, the Br is at C1; the positions meta to Br (C3 and C5) would be activated. So, the NH2- would attack C3 or C5.

Wait, but in this case, the starting material has a D at C2. So, how does that affect substitution?

Wait, maybe the D is on C2, which is adjacent to C1 (Br), so the ring's positions are C1 (Br), C2 (D), C3 (H), C4 (H), C5 (H), C6 (H).

So, the nucleophilic substitution would occur at C3 or C5 (meta to Br). But wait, if the substitution occurs, the product would be 3-aminophenyl with Br and D in certain positions.

Wait, but if substitution occurs at C3, the product would be 3-amino-1-bromo-2-deutero-benzene. Similarly, substitution at C5 would give 5-amino-1-bromo-2-deutero-benzene. But wait, would these be different structures? Let me think.

Wait, in benzene, positions 3 and 5 are symmetric with respect to the Br at position 1. Because the ring is symmetric, substituting at 3 or 5 would lead to the same compound. So, that's only one product from substitution.

Alternatively, maybe substitution occurs at C4, which is para to Br. Wait, but Br is an ortho/para director for electrophilic substitution, but for nucleophilic substitution, the activating groups are different. Wait, I'm a bit uncertain about the directing effects in nucleophilic substitution.

Wait, in nucleophilic aromatic substitution, the position is activated by strong electron-withdrawing groups. So, the substituent (Br) being at C1 would deactivate the ring, but the para position (C4) would be more activated? Or the meta positions (C3 and C5)?

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this mixed up. Let me recall: in electrophilic substitution, Br is ortho/para directing. In nucleophilic substitution, the activating groups (like -NO2) are meta directing. But Br is a deactivating, ortho/para directing group, so in nucleophilic substitution, perhaps the attack is also at ortho and para positions.

Wait, but that might vary. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed via substitution but via elimination.

Wait, another possibility: in the presence of a strong base, perhaps the Br leaves, and the ring undergoes some change.

Wait, wait, if the Br leaves, that would form a benzene ring with a positive charge, but that's not possible because benzene is stable and aromatic. Alternatively, perhaps it's more about deprotonation leading to a negatively charged ring, but that would lead to antiaromaticity if the ring becomes cyclohexenide.

Wait, maybe the base deprotonates a hydrogen adjacent to Br, leading to a conjugated base. Then, the Br leaves, and we have a cycloheptatrienyl anion or something else.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think of the possible products.

If the reaction is a substitution where Br is replaced by NH2, then the product would be 1-amino-2-d-benzene, but considering the substituents.

Wait, but NaNH2 is providing the NH2- nucleophile. So, substitution would give 1-amino-2-d-benzene, perhaps. But wait, the starting material is 1-bromo-2-d-benzene. If substitution occurs, the Br is replaced by NH2. So, the product would be 1-amino-2-d-benzene. So, one product.

Alternatively, if elimination occurs, perhaps benzyne is formed, but that requires two leaving groups.

Wait, so perhaps this is a dehydrohalogenation reaction, leading to the loss of H and Br, forming a triple bond.

Wait, but the starting material only has one Br. Hmm.

Wait, but wait, the ring has a D on C2 and Br on C1. If the base abstracts a proton from C2, but C2 has D, not H. So, the H adjacent to Br would be on C3 or C6.

Wait, if the base abstracts a proton from C3, adjacent to C2 (D), then perhaps the Br leaves, and a triple bond forms between C1 and C2? But wait, C1 is Br, C2 is D. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts a proton from C6 (which is adjacent to C1, the Br), leading to the formation of a triple bond between C1 and C6.

Wait, but if the base removes H from C6, then C1 (Br) and C6 (now a carbanion) could lose Br- and form a triple bond between C1 and C6, making a benzyne.

But wait, benzyne formation typically requires two adjacent leaving groups. Since the starting material only has one Br, maybe this isn't feasible.

Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again.

Wait, another possibility: the base could abstract a proton from the ring, leading to a benzene ring with a deprotonated site, which then results in the loss of the Br as a leaving group. But how would that lead to a product?

If the ring loses Br- and a proton, perhaps forming a cyclohexadienyl cation or anion. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the base is causing a ring expansion. For example, benzene could expand to a larger ring, incorporating the NH2 group.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a Friedel-Crafts type, but that typically uses AlCl3 as a catalyst, and NaNH2 is a base, so maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps the NaNH2 is acting as a base to abstract a proton, leading to the elimination of Br and the formation of a new double bond, turning the benzene into a cyclohexene derivative. But that seems unlikely because benzene is already fully conjugated.

Wait, but wait. If the benzene ring loses a proton and the Br leaves, perhaps the ring could contract. For example, from six-membered to five-membered, releasing HBr and forming cyclopentadienyl. But I'm not entirely sure about the mechanism.

If that's the case, the product would be cyclopentadiene or something similar, but I'm not certain if that's what's happening here.

Alternatively, maybe this is a Birch reduction, but Birch typically uses metals like Na or Mg with NH3, and NaNH2 might not be the same.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about the possible products again.

So, considering the initial structure is 1-bromo-2-deutero-benzene, and the reaction is with NaNH2 in ammonia.

Another angle: the reaction could be a dehydrohalogenation, but in aromatic compounds, that's not straightforward. Alternatively, it could be a coupling reaction, but I don't recall NaNH2 being used for coupling.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a simple elimination. If the Br leaves, but for that, we need a good leaving group, which Br- is. So, perhaps the base abstracts a proton adjacent to Br, leading to the formation of a double bond as Br leaves.

Wait, but in benzene, all carbons are sp² hybridized, so maybe the elimination would form a triple bond, making benzyne.

But for benzyne formation, typically, two adjacent halogens are needed, like in o-dibromobenzene, which upon elimination forms benzyne. But in this case, we have only one Br and a D adjacent.

Hmm, so perhaps that's not possible.

Alternatively, maybe the D is involved in some way. Wait, but D is like a heavier hydrogen, so perhaps it acts similarly but is less acidic. But in this case, the D is on C2, so the base can't abstract it because D is less acidic than H.

So, the base would abstract a H from another position, perhaps C3 or C6.

Wait, but if the base abstracts a H from C3, which is adjacent to C2 (D), then Br is on C1. So, the structure is C1 (Br), C2 (D), C3 (H). If the base takes the H from C3, then the adjacent C2 (D) and C4 (H) are there.

But I don't see how Br would leave in that case.

Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts a H from C6, which is para to C2 (D).

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should think about the possible products again.

So, under NaNH2 in ammonia, what kind of reactions typically occur with aryl halides?

Wait, I remember that aromatic rings with strong electron-withdrawing groups can undergo elimination to form benzynes when treated with strong bases. For example, 1,2-dihalobenzenes can eliminate two X- groups to form benzyne.

But in this case, we have only one Br and a D. So, perhaps it's not possible to form benzyne.

Alternatively, maybe the D is just a substituent, and the reaction is about deprotonation leading to substitution.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the reaction is a coupling reaction. For example, the NaNH2 could abstract a proton, making a benzene ring with a negative charge, which could attack another molecule. But I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a simple substitution where Br is replaced by NH2. If that's the case, the product would have NH2 where Br was. So, that's one product.

But wait, could there be more than one product?

Wait, substitution could occur at different positions due to possible resonance structures. But in this case, the substituent is Br, which is a meta director. So, substitution would occur at the meta positions relative to Br.

But wait, in this molecule, the Br is at position 1, so the meta positions are 3 and 5. But wait, in a benzene ring, positions 3 and 5 are actually adjacent to each other relative to position 1.

Wait, no. Let me visualize the benzene ring:

Positions:
1 (Br)
2 (D)
3
4
5
6

So, the positions para to Br (position 1) is position 4. The meta positions are 3 and 5.

If substitution occurs at 3, then the product would be 3-amino-1-bromo-2-deutero-benzene. Similarly, substitution at 5 would give 5-amino-1-bromo-2-deutero-benzene.

But wait, are 3 and 5 different positions in the ring, or are they equivalent due to symmetry?

If the starting material is 1-bromo-2-deutero-benzene, then positions 3 and 5 are symmetric across the Br at position 1. So, substituting at 3 or 5 would give the same product.

So, substitution would give only one product. So, that's one possibility.

Alternatively, if the substitution occurs at position 4 (para to Br), that would be another product. But wait, Br is an ortho/para director for electrophilic substitution, but for nucleophilic substitution, the directing might be different.

Wait, since Br is an electron-withdrawing group, it would activate the ring for nucleophilic attack at the para position. Or maybe the meta positions. I'm a bit confused.

Wait, in nucleophilic aromatic substitution, the substituent directs incoming nucleophiles to positions that are meta or para relative to itself, depending on the substituent's nature.

But I'm not entirely sure. Let's think.

In nucleophilic aromatic substitution, strong electron-withdrawing groups (like nitro) activate the ring at the meta positions. So, perhaps in this case, Br, which is a moderately electron-withdrawing group, would direct the nucleophile to the meta positions. So, substitution would occur at C3 and C5.

But earlier I thought that C3 and C5 are symmetric, so substitution would yield only one product. So, that's one product from substitution.

Alternatively, if substitution occurs at C4 (para to Br), would that be possible? Because Br is ortho/para directing in electrophilic substitution, but for nucleophilic substitution, perhaps it's the same.

Wait, no, in nucleophilic aromatic substitution, the directing effects are different. For example, nitro groups are meta directors. For Br, which is a weaker EWG, perhaps it's also a meta director.

So, substitution would occur at the meta positions (C3 and C5). But due to symmetry, substitution at C3 and C5 gives the same product. So, only one product from substitution.

So, substitution gives one product.

But wait, what if elimination occurs, leading to a different product?

Earlier, I thought about benzyne, but without two X groups, perhaps that's not possible. Alternatively, maybe the ring contracts or expands.

Wait, another possibility: the base could abstract a proton, leading to the formation of a benzene ring with a negative charge, which then could lose Br- to form a cyclopentadienyl anion. But I'm not sure about the specifics.

If that's the case, then the product would be cyclopentadienyl with some substituents. But I don't know the exact structure, but perhaps it's another product.

So, if substitution gives one product and elimination gives another, that's two products.

Wait, but in the given reaction, how many products would form?

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction undergoes more than one substitution, but I can't think of why.

Wait, another angle: in the reaction conditions, perhaps the base can abstract a proton from a position that's more acidic. The Br is at C1, making the adjacent Cs (C2 and C6) more acidic. But C2 has D, so the base would abstract a proton from C6. So, deprotonating C6 would lead to a benzene with a negative charge on C6.

Then, perhaps the Br leaves, and a new bond is formed between C1 and C6, leading to a five-membered ring.

Wait, that would form a cyclopentadienyl ring. So, the product would be cyclopentadienyl with a deuterium on C2 and maybe some hydrogen elsewhere.

But wait, the exact structure would depend on the positions. So, perhaps this would give a different product than substitution.

So, if substitution gives one product and elimination gives another, that's two products.

But wait, can both substitution and elimination happen under the same conditions? Or would one dominate?

Alternatively, maybe the reaction can proceed via different mechanisms, leading to multiple products.

But I'm not sure. Another thought: maybe the reaction leads to the formation of a benzene ring with two substituents, such as NH2 and D, with Br eliminated.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to think about the options again.

The question is asking how many possible organic products are formed.

The options are A)4, B)1, C)2, D)3.

If substitution gives one product and elimination gives another, that's two products.

But wait, could there be more than one product from elimination?

Alternatively, perhaps the elimination forms a diradical or some structure that can lead to multiple products, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the deprotonation leads to a benzene anion, which then could lose Br- to form cyclopentadienyl anion. But would that form a stable product?

Alternatively, perhaps the base causes a ring expansion, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation, leading to the formation of a benzene ring with a triple bond (benzyne), but only if two adjacent leaving groups are present. Since we have only one Br, maybe that's not possible.

So, perhaps only substitution occurs, giving one product. Or elimination leading to another product.

Wait, but without benzyne formation, perhaps substitution is the only reaction possible, giving one product.

Alternatively, if the reaction leads to the NH2 group adding to the ring in more than one position, but due to symmetry, they count as the same product.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should look for similar reactions. I remember that when benzene rings have electron-withdrawing groups like nitro, NaNH2 can deprotonate to form a ring expansion. For example, in the case of nitrobenzene, NaNH2 can abstract a proton, leading to a ring expansion to form cycloheptatriene.

Wait, so perhaps in this case, the base abstracts a proton, leading to a ring expansion from six-membered to seven-membered.

So, the starting material is 1-bromo-2-deutero-benzene. After deprotonation, the ring expands, incorporating the Br and the D into a larger ring.

Wait, but how would that happen exactly? Let me think.

Deprotonation would occur at a position that's activated by the EWG (Br). So, deprotonation at C3 (meta to Br) would generate a negative charge, which could then attack the adjacent C2 (D), leading to ring expansion.

But I'm not sure about the exact mechanism, but if such a ring expansion occurs, the product would be a cycloheptatrienyl ring with substituents.

So, that would be another product.

So, substitution gives one product, ring expansion gives another, leading to two products.

Alternatively, perhaps the ring expansion is the only product, but I'm not certain.

Another thought: perhaps the base abstracts a hydrogen, leading to a benzene ring with a carbanion, which then could lose the Br- as a leaving group, forming a cyclopentadienyl anion. That would be another product.

So, if substitution gives one product and ring contraction (to cyclopentadienyl) gives another, that's two products.

So, the total number of products would be two.

Wait, but what if the reaction only proceeds via substitution, giving one product, and no elimination or ring expansion occurs? Then the answer would be one.

But I'm not entirely certain which way the reaction goes.

Wait, another approach: looking for similar reactions. I found that when toluene is treated with NaNH2 in ammonia, it deprotonates to form phenyl lithium, but in the case of substituted benzenes, perhaps different reactions occur.

Wait, but in this case, the substituent is Br and D. So, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation, leading to the loss of HBr and forming a triple bond (benzyne). But without another leaving group, that's not possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the D is involved in some way. Wait, but D is a substituent, so maybe it doesn't affect the reaction much.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a simple substitution, replacing Br with NH2. So, the product is 1-amino-2-deutero-benzene. That's one product.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to the formation of a benzene ring with NH2 and D in different positions. But I'm not sure.

Hmm.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the reaction is a coupling reaction, but I don't see how NaNH2 would facilitate that.

Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts a proton, leading to the formation of a benzene diradical, which then loses Br and D, but that seems unlikely.

Another angle: the product could be a benzene ring with Br and NH2 groups. But where?

Wait, if substitution occurs at the para position (C4), then the product is 4-amino-1-bromo-2-d-benzene. Alternatively, substitution at meta (C3 or C5) would give 3-amino-1-bromo-2-d-benzene.

But considering symmetry, substitution at C3 and C5 would give the same product. So, substitution at C3 and C5 is one product, substitution at C4 is another product. So that's two possible products.

So, two substitution products.

But wait, how likely is substitution at the para position in this case?

Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe substitution occurs at both ortho and para positions, but given the substituents, maybe only one is possible.

Wait, perhaps the substituent (Br) directs the incoming NH2- to the para position, so substitution occurs only there, yielding one product.

Alternatively, perhaps substitution occurs at both meta and para positions, leading to two products.

But without knowing the exact mechanism, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to only one product.

Wait, perhaps the answer is 2 products. But I'm not entirely sure.

So, putting it all together, I think the possible products are:

1. Substitution at meta position(s) (C3 and/or C5), leading to 3-amino-1-bromo-2-d-benzene.

2. Substitution at para position (C4), leading to 4-amino-1-bromo-2-d-benzene.

If substitution occurs at both meta and para positions, then there are two products.

But wait, considering the directing effects, maybe the para position is more activated for substitution, so substitution occurs only there, giving one product.

Alternatively, perhaps substitution occurs at both meta and para positions, giving two products.

So, the number of products would be two.

But I'm not entirely confident. Another possibility is that the reaction leads to only one product, making the correct answer B)1.

Wait, but if substitution occurs at meta and para, which are distinct positions, that would be two different products.

Wait, but wait, in the case of substitution at C3 and C5, due to the symmetry of the molecule, those two would be the same. So, that's one product. Substitution at C4 would be another, making two products in total.

So, the answer would be two products.

But I'm not entirely sure. Another thought: perhaps the reaction only proceeds via substitution, and substitution leads to only one product because of symmetry, making the answer B)1.

Alternatively, maybe elimination occurs, leading to a new product, making two in total.

Wait, but without knowing the exact reaction pathway, it's a bit tricky.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is two products, so option C)2.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The reaction involves treating 1-bromobenzene-2-d (a benzene ring with bromine at position 1 and deuterium at position 2) with NaNH₂ in condensed ammonia solvent. NaNH₂ is a strong base, and the reaction conditions suggest the possibility of deprotonation, substitution, or elimination. Here's the analysis:

1. **Substitution Reaction**:  
   - NaNH₂ provides NH₂⁻ ions, which can act as a nucleophile. Bromine (Br) is an electron-withdrawing group (EWG) and activates the benzene ring for nucleophilic aromatic substitution.  
   - The incoming NH₂⁻ group is directed to positions meta (C3 and C5) and para (C4) relative to Br.  
   - Substitution at C3 and C5 would yield the same product due to the symmetry of the molecule, while substitution at C4 would yield a distinct product.  
   - Thus, substitution could lead to two products: one from meta substitution (C3/C5) and another from para substitution (C4).

2. **Elimination Reaction**:  
   - Elimination typically requires two adjacent leaving groups (e.g., in o-dihalobenzenes) to form benzyne. However, the starting material has only one bromine atom and a deuterium atom on adjacent carbons, making benzyne formation unlikely.  
   - Other elimination pathways, such as ring contraction or expansion, are not strongly supported by the reaction conditions or the structure of the starting material.

3. **Symmetry Considerations**:  
   - The molecule is symmetric, so substitution at C3 and C5 yields the same product. Therefore, substitution at these positions counts as one product.

4. **Conclusion**:  
   - Substitution at the meta position (C3/C5) gives one product, and substitution at the para position (C4) gives another product.  
   - No other plausible reaction pathways (e.g., elimination or ring expansion) are supported under these conditions.  
   - Thus, the reaction produces two distinct organic products.

ANSWER: C
