Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through the question again to make sure I understand it.

The question says that we're diluting 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then, we titrate this diluted solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options given are A to D, each with two pH values.

Hmm, I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base. So this will be a weak acid-strong base titration. The first step is probably to figure out the concentration of the acetic acid after dilution.

Let me start by calculating the initial concentrations. The initial volume is 20 cm³ (which is 0.02 liters) of 0.05 M acetic acid. When we add 20 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40 cm³ (0.04 liters). 

Using the dilution formula, C1V1 = C2V2. So, C2 = (C1V1)/(V1 + V2). Wait, wait, no, V2 is the total volume after dilution. So:

C2 = (0.05 M * 0.02 L) / 0.04 L

Calculating that: 0.05 * 0.02 is 0.001, divided by 0.04 gives 0.025 M. So the concentration after dilution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Next, when titrating with 0.1 M NaOH, the equivalence point is where moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid. Let's calculate the moles of acetic acid initially.

Moles = concentration * volume (in liters). So, before titration, moles of acetic acid is 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 moles.

At equivalence, moles of NaOH will be equal to moles of acetic acid. So, moles NaOH = 0.001 moles.

The volume of NaOH needed at equivalence can be calculated using M = n/V. So V = n/M. So V = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³.

Wait, but the question is about 25% titration, not the equivalence point. So 25% of the equivalence volume is 2.5 cm³. So at 25% titration, 2.5 cm³ of NaOH has been added.

But wait, when titrating, the 25% refers to the volume of NaOH used relative to the equivalence point volume. So I think that's correct.

But wait, another approach: the amount of NaOH added is 25% of the required for equivalence.

So at 25% titration, the moles of NaOH added are 25% of 0.001 moles, which is 0.00025 moles.

So, for the 25% point: the reaction between acetic acid (CH3COOH) and NaOH is:

CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O.

So, initially, we have 0.001 moles of CH3COOH. After adding 0.00025 moles of NaOH, the reaction will convert 0.00025 moles of CH3COOH to CH3COO^-.

So, the moles remaining of CH3COOH will be 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 moles. And the moles of CH3COO^- produced will be 0.00025 moles.

But wait, what is the total volume of the solution at 25% titration? Initially, the diluted acetic acid solution is 40 cm³. Then, we've added 2.5 cm³ of NaOH. So total volume is 40 + 2.5 = 42.5 cm³ (0.0425 L).

So concentrations:

[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M.

[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

Hmm, wait, but since this is a buffer solution (mix of weak acid and its conjugate base), I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.

Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]).

The pKa is given by the Ka. Ka is 1.85e-5, so pKa = -log(1.85e-5).

Let me calculate that. Log(1.85) is about 0.267, so log(1.85e-5) is 0.267 -5 = -4.733, so pKa is 4.733.

So, pH = 4.733 + log(0.005882 / 0.017647).

Calculate the ratio: 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.3333.

The log of 0.3333 is log(1/3) ≈ -0.477.

So pH ≈ 4.733 - 0.477 ≈ 4.256.

Looking at the options, option A says 4.26 and 8.52. Option D has 4.57 and 6.92. Hmm, but wait, maybe I made a miscalculation.

Wait, let me double-check the concentrations. Initial moles after dilution: 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 moles. At 25% titration, 0.25 * 0.001 = 0.00025 moles of NaOH added. So moles of CH3COOH = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol. Moles of CH3COO^- = 0.00025 mol.

Volume is 40 + 2.5 = 42.5 mL → 0.0425 L.

[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M.

[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

So the ratio is 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 1/3 ≈ 0.333.

pH = pKa + log(1/3) => 4.733 - 0.477 ≈ 4.256.

So approximately 4.26, which matches option A's first value.

Wait, but wait another thing. When we dilute the solution, we have to consider the dilution and how the concentrations change. But I think I accounted for that correctly.

Now, what about the equivalence point?

At equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH to produce acetate ions and water. So the solution is a solution of sodium acetate in water.

Sodium acetate is a salt of a weak acid and a strong base, so it will hydrolyze in water to produce a basic solution.

The concentration of acetate ions can be calculated.

At equivalence, moles of NaOH = 0.001 moles. The volume of NaOH added is 10 cm³, as I calculated earlier. So total volume is 40 +10 =50 cm³ (0.05 L).

The concentration of CH3COO^- is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check. The initial diluted solution is 40 cm³. Equivalence point is when 10 cm³ of NaOH is added, so total volume is 50 cm³.

So [CH3COO^-] = 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

Now, the acetate ion (A^-) will hydrolyze in water:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb for this reaction can be found using Kw / Ka.

Ka is 1.85e-5 → Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 ≈ 5.405e-10.

So, Kb = 5.405e-10.

The concentration is 0.02 M. Let's set up the ICE table.

Initial: [A^-] = 0.02, [HA] = 0, [OH^-] = 0.

Change: -x, +x, +x.

Equilibrium: 0.02 -x ≈ 0.02, x, x.

Kb = (x^2) / (0.02) ≈ 5.405e-10.

So x^2 ≈ 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11.

x ≈ sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5 M.

So [OH^-] ≈ 1.04e-5 M.

pOH = -log(1.04e-5) ≈ 4.98.

So pH = 14 - 4.98 ≈ 9.02.

Wait, that's around 9.02. But the options given don't have that. Hmm, let's see the options again.

Option A: 4.26; 8.52 → No, equivalence point pH is 9.02, not 8.52.

Option D: 4.57;6.92 → No, 6.92 is less than 7, which would be acidic, but equivalence point for a weak acid titrated with strong base is basic, so pH should be above 7.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculations. Let me recheck.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the Kb calculation. Let me recalculate Kb.

Ka = 1.85e-5 → pKa = 4.733.

Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = 5.405e-10.

Yes, that's correct.

So Kb is 5.405e-10.

The [A^-] is 0.02 M.

So, x^2 = Kb * [A^-] = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11.

x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5 M.

So [OH^-] ≈ 1.04e-5 → pOH = 4.98 → pH = 9.02.

Hmm, none of the options have equivalence point pH around 9. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the solution is not just acetate ions but from the reaction with water.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to calculate using the formula for the pH at equivalence point.

The formula is pH = pKa + 0.5*pKw ?

Wait, no, wait, the pH at equivalence for a weak acid titrated with strong base is determined by the hydrolysis of the conjugate base. So the acetate ion concentration is 0.02 M, and Kb is 5.405e-10.

Wait, perhaps using the approximation that x is negligible compared to 0.02, so:

x = sqrt(0.02 * 5.405e-10) = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5 → same as before.

So pH is about 9.02. But none of the options have that.

Wait, looking back at the options:

Option A: 4.26; 8.52 → pH at equivalence is 8.52. But that's below 7, which can't be right for a weak acid titrated with strong base. So option A can't be correct.

Option D: 4.57; 6.92. Again, equivalence point pH is 6.92, which is acidic. So that's wrong.

Option B: 3.17;6.73 → same problem.

Option C:4.73;7.00. Hmm, 7 is neutral. But the equivalence point should be basic, so that's incorrect.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of the acetate concentration.

Wait, let's think again: when titrating 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water, then adding NaOH.

Wait, the initial solution is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid diluted with 20 cm³ of water. So volume is 40 cm³, concentration 0.025 M.

Moles of acetic acid is 0.025 * 0.04 = 0.001 moles.

At equivalence, moles of NaOH will be 0.001. So volume of NaOH is 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L → 10 cm³.

So, when all is done, the total volume is 40 + 10 =50 cm³.

So [CH3COO^-] is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

Wait, but wait, the acetate comes from the neutralization, so yes, 0.001 moles in 0.05 L is 0.02 M.

So I must have made a mistake in the calculation of the pH at equivalence.

Wait, perhaps I should not have used the Kb, but maybe I forgot that the solution is of the sodium acetate, which is a salt. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for the pH of a salt solution.

Another approach: the pH can be found using the formula:

pH = (pKa + pKw) / 2 → Wait, no, that's for a solution of a weak acid and its conjugate base in equal concentrations. Wait, that's the Henderson equation when [A^-] = [HA].

Wait, but in this case, it's a solution of the conjugate base only. So perhaps I should use the hydrolysis approach again.

Wait, let me re-calculate the Kb.

Ka = 1.85e-5 → pKa = ~4.73.

Kw = 1e-14 → Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = 5.405e-10.

So [A^-] is 0.02 M.

The expression for Kb: Kb = [HA][OH^-]/[A^-]

Assuming x is the concentration of OH^-.

So Kb = x^2 / (0.02 - x) ≈ x^2 /0.02, because x is very small.

So x^2 = Kb * 0.02 → same as before.

Wait, maybe I messed up the pKa. Let me re-calculate pKa.

Ka = 1.85e-5 → pKa = -log(1.85e-5). Let me compute this accurately.

Log(1.85) is approximately 0.267. So pKa = 4.733.

So Kb is 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 → 5.405e-10.

So yes, Kb is correct.

Another approach: maybe the solution considers activity coefficients, but that's beyond the scope here.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in computing the pH from [OH^-].

[OH^-] = 1.04e-5 → pOH = log(1.04e-5) → log(1.04)=0.017, so 4.983.

Wait, 1.04e-5 is 1.04 x 10^-5. So the log is log(1.04) + log(1e-5) → 0.017 + (-5) → -4.983. So pOH is 4.983 → pH is 14 - 4.983 =9.017.

Hmm, so pH around 9.02.

Looking back, none of the options have a pH near 9. So I must have done something wrong.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation of the diluted acetic acid concentration.

Wait, initial volume is 20 cm³, 0.05 M. Diluted with 20 cm³ water. So total volume is 40 cm³.

Molarity after dilution is (0.05 M * 0.02 L) / 0.04 L → (0.001) / 0.04 → 0.025 M. That's correct.

Wait, perhaps I forgot to account for the dilution of the solution when NaOH is added.

Wait, no, because when you add 10 cm³ of NaOH to 40 cm³, the total volume is 50 cm³, which I did.

Hmm, perhaps another approach: the moles of NaOH at equivalence is 0.001 moles. The moles of sodium acetate is also 0.001 moles. So the concentration is 0.001 / 0.05 L = 0.02 M.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the sodium ion comes from NaOH and is a spectator ion, so it doesn't affect the pH.

Another thought: perhaps instead of calculating the Kb, I should calculate the pH using the formula for a solution of a salt of a weak acid. The formula is pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]). But in this case, [HA] is zero because all the acid has been neutralized. Wait, no, in the equivalence point, all the acid is converted to its conjugate base. So [HA] is zero, which complicates things. So instead, we have to rely on the hydrolysis of the conjugate base.

Wait, perhaps I should use the hydrolysis equation again.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of [OH^-]. Let me calculate it again.

Kb = [HA][OH^-]/[A^-].

At equivalence, [A^-] = 0.02 M, and [HA] is negligible (x), so:

Kb ≈ (x^2) / 0.02 = 5.405e-10 → x^2 = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 → 1.081e-11 → x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5.

So [OH^-] = 1.04e-5 → pOH = log(1.04e-5) → approximately 4.98 → pH is about 9.02.

But none of the options have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the problem setup.

Wait, perhaps the initial dilution isn't 0.025 M. Let me recheck.

Original volume: 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Moles = 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 moles.

Diluted to 40 cm³ → concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Correct.

So, at equivalence, 0.001 moles of NaOH added, making 0.05 liters of solution → [A^-] = 0.02 M.

Hmm, maybe the options are wrong, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the pH at 25% of the equivalence point, but I have another approach.

Wait, maybe the problem is about the pH at 25% of the titration, but considering the diluted solution.

Wait, another thought: perhaps when titrating, the solution's volume isn't just the initial solution plus the added NaOH. But in reality, the volumes are additive, so perhaps I should consider that.

Wait, but I think I did that. So 25% titration is 2.5 cm³ added, making 42.5 cm³.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the ratio for the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.

Wait, the ratio is [A^-]/[HA], which I calculated as 0.00025 / 0.00075 = 1/3, which is correct.

So the pH should be pKa + log(1/3) → 4.733 - 0.477 ≈4.256, which is 4.26. That matches option A's first pH value.

But then the equivalence point is around 9, which isn't in any option. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe I confused the titration percentages. The question says "at 25% titration". Does that mean 25% of the initial acetic acid has been neutralized, or 25% of the equivalence point?

In this case, it's the same because the equivalence point is based on the moles of acetic acid present.

Wait, but perhaps the question is asking for 25% of the initial solution's volume being titrated. No, that doesn't make much sense.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the moles of NaOH added at 25% titration.

Wait, 25% of the equivalence volume is 2.5 cm³, which is correct.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the calculation of the concentrations after adding NaOH was incorrect. Let me recheck.

At 25% titration, moles of NaOH added: 0.00025 moles. So:

Moles of CH3COOH = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol.

Moles of CH3COO^- = 0.00025 mol.

Total volume is 40 + 2.5 = 42.5 cm³ = 0.0425 L.

So [CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M.

[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

Ratio is 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.333 → pH = pKa + log(0.333) → 4.733 -0.477 ≈4.256 → pH 4.26.

So that's correct. So the first pH is 4.26.

So looking at the options, option A has 4.26 as the first value. The second value (equivalence point pH) is 8.52, which doesn't match my calculation. So perhaps I made a mistake in the equivalence point calculation.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating the equivalence point pH.

Wait, another approach: instead of using Kb, perhaps I should consider that the acetate ion comes from a strong base, so the solution is basic, but perhaps the calculation is different.

Wait, another approach: perhaps using the formula for the pH of a salt solution.

The formula is pH = pKa + 0.5 * (pKa - pKw + pKa + something). Wait, no, perhaps it's better to use the hydrolysis equation again.

Wait, perhaps I should use the exact expression without approximation.

So, Kb = x^2 / (0.02 - x) = 5.405e-10.

Assuming x is very small, 0.02 - x ≈0.02.

So, x^2 =5.405e-10 * 0.02 → x= sqrt(1.081e-11)=1.04e-5.

Wait, so pOH is 4.98, pH is 9.02.

Hmm, but none of the options have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in initial setup.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the solution isn't just sodium acetate but also includes the sodium ions, but sodium ions don't affect pH, so that's not an issue.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in the calculation of the total volume at equivalence.

Wait, initial solution is 40 cm³, and 10 cm³ of NaOH is added → total volume 50 cm³. Correct.

So, I'm confident that the equivalence point pH is around 9.02, but the options don't have that. So perhaps the question intended to calculate the pH at 25% of the initial volume, not 25% of the equivalence point.

Wait, that's a different interpretation. Let me think: the question says "25% titration". Typically, titration percentage refers to the percentage of the equivalence point achieved. So 25% titration means 25% of the NaOH needed to reach equivalence has been added.

But perhaps the question refers to adding 25% of the initial volume of the solution, but that would be 10 cm³, not relevant.

Alternatively, perhaps the question refers to the initial solution being 40 cm³, and 25% of that (10 cm³) has been titrated, but that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation. Let's see the options again.

Option D: 4.57;6.92.

Hmm, the first value is around 4.57. How could that happen?

Wait, perhaps I calculated the 25% titration incorrectly.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the initial moles of acetic acid is 0.001, but after adding 25% of the equivalence NaOH (0.00025 moles), the moles are as I calculated.

Wait, maybe I should use a different approach for the 25% titration. Let me think about the buffer equation again.

Wait, another idea: perhaps I should calculate the pH using the exact concentrations without approximations.

Wait, no, because the ratio is 1:3, which is manageable.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the solution is not at 25% titration but 25% of the initial solution's equivalence point.

Wait, perhaps the question is confusing, but I think I did it correctly.

Another thought: perhaps I made a mistake in the pKa value.

Ka is 1.85e-5 → pKa = 4.733. Correct.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in the equivalence point's pH. Let me think about another formula.

Wait, the pH at the equivalence point can also be calculated using the formula:

pH = (pKa + pKw) / 2 → pH = (4.73 +14)/2 = 9.365.

Wait, that's approximately 9.37, but I calculated 9.02 earlier. Hmm, that's different.

Wait, where does this formula come from? I think it's used when you have a solution of the salt of a weak acid and strong base, where the concentrations of the salt and the weak acid are equal. But in this case, it's a solution of the conjugate base only.

Wait, perhaps another approach: the concentration of the conjugate base is 0.02 M, and the solution's pH can be found using the formula:

OH^- = sqrt(Kb * C) → same as before.

So sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) = sqrt(1.081e-11) = 1.04e-5.

pH = 14 - (pOH) → 14 -4.98 =9.02.

Hmm, so perhaps the formula (pKa + pKw)/2 is incorrect here.

Wait, I think I should stick with my initial calculations. So the pH at 25% is 4.26 and equivalence is 9.02.

But none of the options match. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial dilution. Let me recheck.

20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid → moles = 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 mol.

Diluted to 40 cm³ → 0.04 L → concentration = 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Correct.

Hmm, I'm stuck. The calculated pH at 25% is 4.26, matching option A, but the equivalence point pH isn't matching any option.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the pH at 25% of the initial acetic acid's volume being titrated, but that's probably the same as 25% of the equivalence point.

Wait, maybe I should recheck the options. Option D has 4.57 and 6.92.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in not considering that the solution is at 25% titration, so the volume is 42.5 cm³, but perhaps I should use the concentrations more accurately.

Wait, [HA] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 = 0.017647 M.

[A^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

So the ratio is 0.005882 / 0.017647 = 0.3333.

So, pH = pKa + log(1/3) → 4.733 - 0.477 =4.256 → 4.26.

Hmm, that's correct.

So, the first pH is 4.26, which is option A and D.

Option A's equivalence pH is 8.52. I'm not getting that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the equivalence point calculation.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I should calculate the pH at the equivalence point using the concentration of acetate ions correctly.

Wait, the acetate concentration is 0.02 M. So the Kb is 5.405e-10.

So, Kb = [HA][OH^-]/[A^-] → [HA] is x, [A^-] is 0.02 -x ≈0.02.

So, x^2 = 5.405e-10 *0.02 → 1.081e-11 → x= 1.04e-5.

pOH=4.98 → pH=9.02.

But none of the options have that. So perhaps the mistake is elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps I forgot to consider that the solution isn't at 25°C but another temperature. Oh, no, the question states 25°C, so Kw is 1e-14.

Hmm, maybe the options have a typo, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial problem setup.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the dilution of the NaOH when calculating the pH at 25% titration.

No, wait, because the NaOH is being added in small volumes, but 2.5 cm³ added to 40 cm³ makes the total 42.5 cm³, which I've accounted for.

Wait, another idea: perhaps the initial calculation of the equivalence point's pH is incorrect because the solution is not just acetate ions but also some other factors. Alternatively, perhaps the question is misprinted, and the correct answer isn't among the options, but that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps I should recheck the options. Option D says the equivalence point is 6.92, which is acidic, which can't be right for a weak acid titrated with strong base.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the equivalence point calculation. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the equivalence point isn't calculated correctly. Let me think: when all the acetic acid is neutralized, we get sodium acetate. Sodium is a spectator ion, so the solution's pH depends on the acetate ion's hydrolysis.

So, the concentration is 0.02 M.

Wait, perhaps I should use the exact expression:

Kb = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x) → x^2 = Kb*(0.02 - x).

But since Kb is very small, x is much smaller than 0.02, so 0.02 - x ≈0.02.

So x^2 = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 → x= sqrt(1.081e-11)≈1.04e-5. So [OH^-] =1.04e-5, pOH=4.98, pH=9.02.

Still not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that I used Kb incorrectly. Oh! Wait a second! Wait, I think I made a mistake in the calculation of Kb. Because Kb is Kw / Ka, which is 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 =5.405e-10. Correct.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the solution contains both acetate and acetate's conjugate acid, but no, at equivalence, all the acetic acid is converted to acetate.

I'm stuck. According to my calculations, the pH at 25% is 4.26 and equivalence is 9.02. But none of the options match. So perhaps I made a mistake elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps the initial dilution is incorrect.

Wait, initial volume is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. When diluted with 20 cm³ of water, the new concentration is (0.05 * 20) / 40 = 0.025 M. Correct.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that when I diluted the acetic acid, I should have considered that the volume is 40 cm³, but perhaps I used the wrong molarity.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the initial solution's pH is different before titration, but that's not relevant to the titration points.

Hmm. Maybe I should check the options again. Option D's first pH is 4.57, which is higher than the calculated 4.26. How could that be?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the Henderson-Hasselbalch calculation. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the moles of NaOH added at 25% titration is 25% of the initial moles, which are 0.001.

So 25% of 0.001 is 0.00025 moles, correct.

So, moles of HA: 0.001 - 0.00025 =0.00075.

Moles of A^-: 0.00025.

Volume is 42.5 cm³ → 0.0425 L.

[HA] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 = 0.017647 M.

[A^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 = 0.005882 M.

So ratio is 0.005882 / 0.017647 = 0.3333.

pH = pKa + log(0.3333) → 4.733 -0.477 =4.256 → pH 4.26.

So that's correct.

But why is option A's equivalence point pH 8.52?

Wait, 8.52 is much lower than 9.02. Perhaps the calculation is wrong. Let me think: if I made a mistake in the Kb.

Wait, 1.85e-5 is Ka, so Kb=1e-14/1.85e-5=5.405e-10, correct.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate pH using another approach, like the exact formula.

The exact equation for Kb is:

Kb = (x^2) / (0.02 - x) =5.405e-10.

Assuming x is very small, 0.02 -x ≈0.02.

x^2 =5.405e-10 *0.02 → x=1.04e-5.

Which gives pOH=4.98 → pH=9.02.

Alternatively, perhaps the mistake is that the solution is not 50 cm³ but another volume.

Wait, initial solution is 40 cm³. At equivalence, 10 cm³ of NaOH added → total 50 cm³. Correct.

Hmm, I'm going in circles. Since none of the options match, but option A has the correct pH at 25% titration, perhaps I should proceed with that.

Wait, perhaps the equivalence point pH is not 9.02 but 8.52. How?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the acetate concentration.

Wait, maybe the moles of acetate are not 0.001 but something else. Let me recheck.

At equivalence, moles of NaOH = 0.001. So moles of acetate are 0.001, correct.

Volume is 50 cm³ → 0.05 L.

Concentration is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

Hmm, correct.

Wait, perhaps I used the wrong K value. Let me recalculate Kb.

Ka =1.85e-5 → pKa=4.733.

Kw=1e-14 → Kb=1e-14/(1.85e-5)=5.405e-10.

Yes, correct.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that I forgot to consider that the solution is a 0.02 M acetate solution, which is 20 mM. So perhaps the pH is around 9.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options, but that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps I should re-examine the options.

Looking at option D: pH at 25% titration is 4.57, which is higher than my calculation. How could that be?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the ratio used in Henderson-Hasselbalch.

Another thought: perhaps I should use the exact concentrations without approximating the ratio.

Wait, the ratio is [A^-]/[HA] = (0.00025)/(0.00075) = 1/3.

But perhaps I should calculate it more accurately.

log(1/3)= log(0.3333)= -0.4771.

So pH=4.733-0.4771=4.2559 →4.26.

Hmm, correct.

So the first pH is 4.26, which is option A.

But equivalence point in option A is 8.52, which is way off.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the pH after 25% of the initial solution is titrated, but that would be a different scenario.

Alternatively, perhaps the equivalence point calculation is wrong because I forgot to consider that the concentration of acetate is higher.

Wait, perhaps I should use the exact expression without approximating x.

So, Kb = x^2/(0.02 -x) =5.405e-10.

Assume x is small, so 0.02 -x ≈0.02.

x^2 =5.405e-10 *0.02=1.081e-11 →x=1.04e-5.

So same result.

Hmm.

In conclusion, the only option that matches the pH at 25% titration is option A (4.26) and D (4.57). But my calculation says 4.26, which is option A.

But then equivalence point is around 9.02, which is not in the options.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the question is not about the equivalence point but about the midpoint, but that would be at half-equivalence, where pH=pKa.

Wait, but the question clearly says equivalence point.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that I should have considered that the solution after titration has a higher concentration of OH^-.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of Kb.

Wait, perhaps I should use pOH = (pKa + pKw)/2 → pOH= (4.733 +14)/2=9.366 → pH=4.633.

No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the initial concentration of acetic acid after dilution is different.

Wait, another way: 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid is 1 mmol (since 0.05 M *0.02 L=0.001 mol). Diluted to 40 cm³ → 0.001 mol /0.04 L=0.025 M.

At 25% titration, 0.25 *0.001 =0.00025 mol of NaOH added.

So, moles of CH3COOH=0.00075, CH3COO^- =0.00025.

So the ratio is 0.333, pH=4.26.

So option A's first value.

But equivalence point pH is not in the options. So perhaps the correct answer is not present, but that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that the solution is in a different volume when calculating the equivalence point.

Wait, perhaps the solution's volume isn't 50 cm³ but another value. Let me think.

Wait, the initial solution is 40 cm³. When adding 10 cm³ of NaOH, total volume is 50 cm³.

Yes.

Hmm, perhaps I should reconsider the options.

Wait, perhaps the pH at equivalence point is 8.52, which is option A. How?

Wait, if I made a mistake in calculating Kb, perhaps I used Ka instead.

Wait, if I used Ka=1.85e-5, then pKa=4.733.

If I forgot to invert Kb, perhaps I used Ka instead of Kb.

Wait, if I used Ka instead of Kb, then:

Ka =1.85e-5.

So x^2 = Ka * 0.02 →1.85e-5 *0.02=3.7e-7 →x= sqrt(3.7e-7)=1.9235e-3.

Then [H+]=1.9235e-3 → pH=2.717.

Which is not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps I used the wrong formula.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the solution at equivalence point can be considered as a solution of sodium acetate, and the pH is calculated using the formula pH = 0.5(pKa + pKw).

That gives pH=0.5*(4.73 +14)=0.5*(18.73)=9.365.

Which is close to 9.37, but not matching any option.

Hmm.

Given that none of the options match my calculations, but option A has the correct pH at 25% titration, perhaps I should choose option D, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation of the equivalence point.

Wait, another idea: perhaps I should use the formula for the pH at equivalence point as pH = pKa2 + log([B]/[A]).

Wait, no, that's not applicable here.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula:

pH = (pKa + pKw - pKa') / 2, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the acetate ion's concentration.

Wait, perhaps the moles of acetate ion are incorrect. Wait, moles of acetate = moles of NaOH added, which is 0.001 moles.

Yes, correct.

Hmm.

In conclusion, given the time I've spent and the calculations, I think the correct answer is option A for the 25% titration pH and none of the options match the equivalence point. But since the question expects one of the options, perhaps I should reevaluate.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the dilution.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the initial concentration after dilution is 0.025 M, but perhaps the solution is being treated as 0.025 M when titrated, but that's not the case.

No, because the NaOH is being added, changing the solution's volume.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the pH at equivalence point is 7.00, which is option C. But that can't be correct, as a weak acid titrated with strong base should have a pH >7.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem setup. Perhaps the solution after dilution is 0.025 M, but the equivalence point is when 0.001 moles of NaOH are added, but perhaps the volume is different.

Wait, perhaps the initial solution is 40 cm³, and the NaOH is 0.1 M. So moles of NaOH needed = 0.001.

Volume of NaOH=0.001 /0.1=0.01 L=10 cm³.

So, the total volume is 40+10=50 cm³.

So, [A^-]=0.001/0.05=0.02 M.

So, Kb=5.405e-10.

So, [OH^-]=sqrt(0.02 *5.405e-10)=sqrt(1.081e-11)=1.04e-5.

pH=14 -4.98=9.02.

So, no match.

Hmm.

Since I can't find any errors in my calculations, I'll proceed with the initial conclusion that the pH at 25% is 4.26 and equivalence is ~9.02, but since none of the options match, I'll have to choose the option that has 4.26 as the first value, which is option A. Perhaps the equivalence point in the options is wrong, but I'll proceed.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we first calculate the concentration of acetic acid after dilution. The initial volume of acetic acid is 20.00 cm³ (0.02 L) with a concentration of 0.05 M. After dilution with 20.00 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40.00 cm³ (0.04 L). Using the dilution formula \( C_1V_1 = C_2V_2 \), the new concentration is:

\[
C_2 = \frac{C_1V_1}{V_2} = \frac{0.05 \times 0.02}{0.04} = 0.025 \, \text{M}.
\]

### 25% Titration
At 25% titration, 25% of the equivalence point volume has been reached. The moles of acetic acid initially are:

\[
\text{Moles of acetic acid} = 0.025 \, \text{M} \times 0.04 \, \text{L} = 0.001 \, \text{moles}.
\]

At 25% titration, 25% of these moles (0.00025 moles) have been neutralized by NaOH. The remaining moles of acetic acid are:

\[
\text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COOH} = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 \, \text{moles}.
\]

The moles of acetate ion (\( \text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- \)) formed are:

\[
\text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COO}^- = 0.00025 \, \text{moles}.
\]

The total volume of the solution at 25% titration is:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 2.5 \, \text{cm}^3 = 42.5 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.0425 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentrations of acetic acid and acetate ion are:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}] = \frac{0.00075}{0.0425} \approx 0.017647 \, \text{M},
\]
\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.00025}{0.0425} \approx 0.005882 \, \text{M}.
\]

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{pKa} + \log \left( \frac{[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-]}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}]} \right),
\]

where \( \text{pKa} = -\log(1.85 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.733 \). Substituting the ratio:

\[
\text{pH} = 4.733 + \log \left( \frac{0.005882}{0.017647} \right) = 4.733 + \log(0.333) \approx 4.733 - 0.477 = 4.256 \, (\text{rounded to } 4.26).
\]

### Equivalence Point
At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized, forming 0.001 moles of acetate ion. The total volume is:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 10.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 50.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.05 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentration of acetate ion is:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.001}{0.05} = 0.02 \, \text{M}.
\]

The acetate ion hydrolyzes in water:

\[
\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O} \leftrightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{OH}^-.
\]

The \( K_b \) for this reaction is:

\[
K_b = \frac{K_w}{K_a} = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.405 \times 10^{-10}.
\]

Using the approximation \( K_b = \frac{x^2}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-]} \), where \( x = [\text{OH}^-] \):

\[
x^2 = K_b \cdot [\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = (5.405 \times 10^{-10})(0.02) = 1.081 \times 10^{-11},
\]
\[
x = \sqrt{1.081 \times 10^{-11}} \approx 1.04 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{M}.
\]

The pOH is:

\[
\text{pOH} = -\log(1.04 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.98,
\]

and the pH is:

\[
\text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 4.98 = 9.02.
\]

### Analysis of Options
- **Option A**: \( 4.26; 8.52 \). The pH at 25% titration matches, but the equivalence point pH does not.
- **Option B**: \( 3.17; 6.73 \). Both values are incorrect.
- **Option C**: \( 4.73; 7.00 \). Both values are incorrect.
- **Option D**: \( 4.57; 6.92 \). Both values are incorrect.

The calculated pH at 25% titration matches **Option A** (\( 4.26 \)), but the equivalence point pH (\( 9.02 \)) does not match any option. Since the question requires selecting one option, **Option A** is the best choice based on the correct pH at 25% titration.
