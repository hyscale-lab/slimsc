Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when three different solutions are mixed. Hmm, I remember that neutralization reactions involve acids and bases reacting to form water and a salt. The enthalpy change for these reactions is usually measured in kilojoules per mole, right? 

The problem gives me three solutions: HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2. Let me write down the details. 

HCl is 500 mL of 0.2 M. H2SO4 is 300 mL of 0.3 M. Ba(OH)2 is 200 mL of 0.5 M. I think I should figure out how much acid and base there is in terms of moles to determine the limiting reagent because the reaction will stop when one of them is used up.

Wait, HCl is a strong acid, H2SO4 is a strong acid too, but Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. But wait, sulfuric acid is diprotic, meaning it can donate two H+ ions per molecule. Similarly, Ba(OH)2 is a strong base and I think it dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2 OH^- ions. So each mole of Ba(OH)2 would provide two moles of OH-.

The neutralization reaction between an acid and a base typically follows the equation: Acid + Base → Salt + Water. The enthalpy change ΔH is usually negative because the reaction is exothermic.

So first, I should calculate the moles of H+ from the acids and the moles of OH- from the base.

For HCl: moles = Molarity × Volume (in liters). So 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 moles of HCl. Since HCl is a strong acid, each mole gives one H+. So 0.1 moles H+.

For H2SO4: 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 moles H2SO4. Since it's diprotic, each mole gives 2 H+, so 0.18 moles H+.

So total H+ from acids is 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 moles.

Now, Ba(OH)2: 0.5 M * 0.2 L = 0.1 moles Ba(OH)2. Each mole gives 2 OH-, so 0.2 moles OH-.

Wait, but the neutralization reaction for each H+ and OH- is 1:1. So the total H+ is 0.28, OH- is 0.2. That means OH- is the limiting reagent because 0.2 is less than 0.28. So all the OH- will be used up, and some H+ will remain.

So the amount of H+ neutralized is 0.2 moles. Therefore, the reaction will produce 0.2 moles of water. 

But wait, what about the enthalpy? The standard enthalpy of neutralization is usually given as about -57.3 kJ per mole of H+ neutralized. Or wait, sometimes it's written as -57.3 kJ per mole of H2O formed. Because for each mole of H+ reacting, one mole of H2O is formed. So if 0.2 moles of H+ are neutralized, the enthalpy change would be 0.2 × (-57.3) kJ.

Let me calculate that: 0.2 × 57.3 = 11.46. So the enthalpy change is -11.46 kJ. But wait, looking at the options, option B is -11.42 kcal. Oh, wait, the options have kcal and kJ. Hmm, so I need to be careful with units.

Wait, 1 calorie is about 4.184 joules. So 1 kilocalorie (kcal) is 4184 J, and 1 kJ is 1000 J. So to convert kJ to kcal, you divide by 4.184.

If I have 11.46 kJ, that's 11460 J. Divided by 4184 J/kcal, that's approximately 2.737 kcal. So like 2.74 kcal, but with a negative sign. Wait, but wait: the enthalpy change for the neutralization is exothermic, so negative. So if I have 0.2 moles, that's -11.46 kJ, which is about -2.74 kcal.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is -2.72 kcal, option B is -11.42 kcal, and option D is -16.0 kJ. So which one is correct?

Wait, I think I might have made a mistake. Let me go back. The neutralization reaction between a strong acid and a strong base produces one mole of water per mole of H+ and OH- reacted. So the enthalpy change per mole of H+ is -57.3 kJ. So for 0.2 moles, it's 0.2 × (-57.3) = -11.46 kJ, which is -11,460 J. To convert to kcal, 11460 / 4184 ≈ 2.737 kcal. So about -2.74 kcal. Looking at the options, option A is -2.72, which is close. Option B is -11.42 kJ which is about -11.42 kJ, but wait, the calculation gave me -11.46 kJ, which is approximately -11.46 kJ. Hmm, but the options have B as -11.42 kcal, which would be much larger in kJ. So maybe I shouldn't convert and instead see whether the question expects kJ or kcal.

Wait, the options have both. Option D is -16.0 kJ. Hmm, perhaps I messed up the calculation somewhere.

Wait, another thought: H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, but in aqueous solution, it dissociates completely in two steps. The first dissociation is complete, giving H+ and HSO4^-; the second dissociation isn't 100% complete, but for strong acids like H2SO4, the first H+ is fully released, and the second is also considered (but wait, in reality, the second H+ isn't as strong as the first. Hmm, but I think for the purpose of neutralization, we can consider both H+ ions as available for reaction. So for 0.3 M H2SO4, 0.3 L × 0.3 M = 0.09 moles H2SO4, which would give 0.18 moles H+ (since each gives two).

But wait, another angle: when mixing the solutions, the total volume changes, but I think for moles, volume doesn't matter beyond calculating moles. So I think the calculation is correct that the moles of H+ are 0.28 and OH- are 0.2.

Wait, but wait a second. When mixing different acids and bases, the neutralization might involve considering the equivalents. Since HCl and H2SO4 contribute H+ and Ba(OH)2 contributes OH-.

Hmm, but another approach: let's calculate the equivalents.

Equivalents of H+ from HCl: 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 eq (since each HCl gives 1 H+).

Equivalents from H2SO4: 0.3 M *0.3 L * 2 = 0.18 eq (since each H2SO4 gives 2 H+).

Total H+ equivalents: 0.28.

Equivalents of OH- from Ba(OH)2: 0.5 M *0.2 L * 2 = 0.2 eq (since each Ba(OH)2 gives 2 OH-).

So total OH- is 0.2 eq. So the neutralization will consume 0.2 H+ and 0.2 OH-, producing 0.2 H2O.

So the amount of H+ neutralized is 0.2 moles. Each mole gives ΔH = -57.3 kJ. So 0.2 × (-57.3) = -11.46 kJ.

Wait, but that's in kJ. The options have B as -11.42 kcal and another as -16 kJ. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake with the stoichiometry of the reaction. Another possibility: the reaction between H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 might produce a salt, but perhaps that affects the calculation.

Wait, when H2SO4 reacts with Ba(OH)2, the reaction is:

H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 + 2 H2O.

But wait, let's write the balanced equation. H2SO4 is diprotic, so the reaction with a dihydroxide base would be:

H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 + 2 H2O.

Wait, but Ba(OH)2 is a strong base and would dissociate into Ba^2+ and 2 OH^-.

Similarly, H2SO4 in water is H+ and HSO4^- (first dissociation) and then HSO4^- can dissociate further into H+ and SO4^2-.

So when H2SO4 reacts with Ba(OH)2:

H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4(s) + 2 H2O.

The stoichiometry is 1:1, producing 2 H2O. So each mole of H2SO4 reacts with 1 mole of Ba(OH)2, and produces 2 moles of H2O, releasing 2 × 57.3 kJ (since each H2O is 57.3 kJ). Wait, but no, the enthalpy per mole of H+ is 57.3 kJ. So perhaps for each mole of H2SO4, which contributes 2 H+, the enthalpy is 2 × 57.3 kJ = 114.6 kJ per mole of H2SO4.

Wait, no, because each H+ is neutralized by an OH-.

But wait, in this problem, we have three solutions being mixed: HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2. So the H+ from both acids will react with the OH- from the base.

But wait, perhaps the way I calculated earlier is correct. Let me think again.

So the total H+ from both acids is 0.28 moles, and the OH- is 0.2 moles. So the OH- is the limiting reagent, and 0.2 moles of H+ will react, producing 0.2 moles of H2O, releasing 0.2 × 57.3 kJ = 11.46 kJ. Since it's exothermic, it's -11.46 kJ. 

Looking at the options, option B is -11.42 kcal. Hmm, but 11.46 kJ is about 2.74 kcal (since 11,460 J / 4,184 J/kcal ≈ 2.737). So that's about 2.74 kcal, so the enthalpy change would be -2.74 kcal. Looking at the options, option A is -2.72 kcal. That's very close. 

But wait, why is option B -11.42 kcal? Because 11.42 kcal would be 11.42 × 4.184 ≈ 47.7 kJ. That's higher than our calculated 11.46 kJ. So perhaps there's a mistake in the options.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the stoichiometry. Maybe the enthalpy per mole of H2O is -57.3 kJ, so 0.2 moles would give 0.2 × (-57.3) = -11.46 kJ, which is approximately -11.46 kJ. Wait, but option D is -16.0 kJ, which is higher. So none of the options exactly match 11.46 kJ.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in the calculation of moles. Let me double-check.

HCl: 500 mL = 0.5 L. 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 moles HCl → 0.1 H+.

H2SO4: 300 mL = 0.3 L. 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 moles H2SO4 → 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles H+.

Total H+: 0.28.

Ba(OH)2: 200 mL = 0.2 L. 0.5 M * 0.2 L = 0.1 moles Ba(OH)2 → each gives 2 OH- → 0.2 moles OH-.

So H+ (0.28) vs OH- (0.2). So OH- is limiting. So 0.2 moles of H+ neutralized.

So ΔH = 0.2 * (-57.3) = -11.46 kJ ≈ -11.46 kJ. Looking at options, the closest is option B (-11.42 kcal) or option D (-16.0 kJ). Hmm, but wait, -11.46 kJ is approximately -11.5 kJ, which is close to option B if they made a mistake in units.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for kilocalories, and option B is the correct answer in kcal. Because 11.46 kJ is about 2.74 kcal. So the correct answer would be -2.74 kcal, which is close to option A (-2.72 kcal). But none of the options directly match.

Wait, maybe I should consider whether the neutralization of H2SO4 requires only one H+ or both. Oh wait, H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, but in the first dissociation, it's a strong acid, so it donates both H+ ions. Or wait, no, the first H+ is strong, the second is weaker but still considered strong in some contexts. So for the purpose of neutralization, each H2SO4 would contribute 2 moles of H+.

So I think the initial calculation is correct. So the enthalpy change is -11.46 kJ, which is approximately -11.5 kJ, which isn't an option. Oh wait, looking at the options:

Option D is -16.0 kJ. Hmm, no. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in which reactant is the limiting one.

Wait, another possibility: when you mix HCl and H2SO4 with the same base, perhaps the neutralization is not just the sum of H+ and OH-. Maybe the reaction has to consider the individual reactions. But I don't think that's the case. The H+ from both acids will react with OH- from the base.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the neutralization of each acid separately, but that seems unlikely. For example, HCl and Ba(OH)2 reacting, and then H2SO4 and the remaining Ba(OH)2 reacting. Let me think.

Wait, perhaps the approach is to first neutralize the Ba(OH)2 with HCl, and then the remaining H2SO4 reacts with the Ba(OH)2. Let's see.

Wait, Ba(OH)2 has 0.2 moles of OH- (from 0.1 moles of Ba(OH)2). HCl has 0.1 moles of H+. So when they react, they neutralize 0.1 moles of H+ and 0.1 moles of OH-.

Now, after that, the remaining OH- in solution is 0.2 - 0.1 = 0.1 moles. The remaining H+ comes from H2SO4: 0.18 moles.

So the next reaction is between the remaining 0.1 moles of OH- and 0.18 moles of H+ from H2SO4. So 0.1 moles of H+ will react with OH-, producing 0.1 moles of H2O.

So total H+ neutralized is 0.1 (from HCl) + 0.1 (from H2SO4) = 0.2 moles. So same as before, total ΔH is 0.2 * (-57.3) = -11.46 kJ.

So same result.

Another thought: perhaps the enthalpy per mole of H+ is -57.3 kcal. Wait, no. Because 57.3 kJ is about 13.66 kcal (since 1 kJ ≈ 0.239 kcal). Wait, no, wait, 1 kcal is 4.184 kJ, so 57.3 kJ is 57,300 J. 57,300 / 4,184 ≈ 13.69 kcal. So per mole of H+ neutralized, it's -13.69 kcal. Then, 0.2 moles would be 0.2 * 13.69 ≈ 2.74 kcal. So ΔH is -2.74 kcal, which is approximately -2.72 kcal as in option A.

But wait, that's a different approach. So if the standard enthalpy is -57.3 kJ/mol H+ (which is correct), but if someone mistakenly uses it as kcal, they might think it's about -13.69 kcal/mol H+. 

In that case, 0.2 moles would be 0.2 * (-13.69) ≈ -2.74 kcal, which is option A. So perhaps the correct answer is A.

But wait, why would the options have B as -11.42 kcal, which is about 47.7 kJ (11.42 × 4.184 ≈ 47.7)? That doesn't match any of the calculations.

Alternatively, perhaps the enthalpy of neutralization is per mole of acid-base reaction, not per mole of H+. Let me think.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the problem is considering the neutralization per mole of the acid and base, not per H+. But that doesn't make sense because neutralization is based on H+ and OH-.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the reaction of H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 as a separate reaction. Let's see.

The reaction between H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 is:

H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 + 2 H2O.

The mole ratio is 1:1. So moles of H2SO4 is 0.09, moles of Ba(OH)2 is 0.1.

So Ba(OH)2 is in excess? No, wait, moles of H2SO4 is 0.09, Ba(OH)2 is 0.1. So H2SO4 is the limiting reagent.

So in this case, 0.09 moles of H2SO4 would react with 0.09 moles of Ba(OH)2, producing 0.09 moles of BaSO4 and 0.18 moles of H2O.

The enthalpy change for this reaction would be 0.09 moles × (ΔH per mole of reaction). What's the ΔH for that reaction? Well, each mole produces 2 moles of H2O, so ΔH would be 2 × (-57.3) × 0.09 = 0.18 × 57.3 ≈ -10.314 kJ.

But wait, that's just for the H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 reaction. Then, we have the HCl reacting with the remaining Ba(OH)2.

After the H2SO4 reacts, the moles of Ba(OH)2 left would be 0.1 - 0.09 = 0.01 moles. Each Ba(OH)2 gives 2 OH-, so 0.02 moles OH-.

The HCl has 0.1 moles H+ and 0.02 moles OH- would react, producing 0.02 moles H2O. The ΔH would be 0.02 × (-57.3) = -1.146 kJ.

So total ΔH is (-10.314) + (-1.146) = -11.46 kJ.

So same as before, about -11.46 kJ. So that's 11.46 kJ exothermic, which is -11.46 kJ. Hmm, but the options don't have that exactly. Option B is -11.42 kcal, which is about 47.7 kJ. So that's way higher than 11.46 kJ. So perhaps I'm getting confused with the units.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the answer in kcal, in which case 11.46 kJ is about 2.74 kcal. So the answer would be -2.74 kcal, which is approximately option A (-2.72 kcal).

But why is option B even there? It says -11.42 kcal, which is about 47.7 kJ. That would be if 0.2 moles × 239 kcal/mol (which isn't a standard value).

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that each mole of H2SO4 gives two moles of H+ and each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives two moles of OH-, but when considering the reaction, maybe it's per mole of acid-base pairs. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the neutralization of each H+ as a separate reaction. So for each mole of H+, the enthalpy is -57.3 kJ. So 0.28 moles H+ total, but only 0.2 moles react. So -0.2 × 57.3 = -11.46 kJ.

But looking at the options, D is -16.0 kJ, which is higher. So perhaps the correct answer is B, but why?

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the moles calculation. Let me recheck.

HCl: 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 mol HCl → 0.1 H+.

H2SO4: 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 mol H2SO4 → 0.18 H+.

Ba(OH)2: 0.5 M * 0.2 L = 0.1 mol Ba(OH)2 → 0.2 mol OH-.

So H+ total: 0.28, OH-: 0.2. So OH- is limiting. So neutralization of 0.2 H+.

So 0.2 × 57.3 kJ = 11.46 kJ. So the enthalpy change is -11.46 kJ, which is approximately -11.46 kJ.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps the answer is option B if the units are mixed up. Alternatively, option D is -16 kJ, which doesn't fit. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that I used 57.3 kJ per mole of H+ neutralized, but the standard value is actually per mole of H2O formed, which is the same as per mole of H+ neutralized. So that part is correct.

I think the correct answer would be -11.46 kJ, which is approximately -11.5 kJ. But looking at the options, none have -11.5 kJ except option B which is -11.42 kcal. Wait, no, option B is in kcal, so perhaps the correct answer is not among the options. But that can't be. Oh wait, perhaps the options are in kcal, and I'm miscalculating.

Wait, 0.2 moles × 57.3 kJ = 11.46 kJ. To convert to kcal: 11.46 / 4.184 ≈ 2.737 kcal. So -2.74 kcal. Looking at the options, option A is -2.72 kcal, which is the closest. So perhaps the answer is A.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the moles. Let me check:

HCl: 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 mol HCl → 0.1 H+.

H2SO4: 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 mol H2SO4 → 0.18 H+.

Total H+ = 0.28.

Ba(OH)2: 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 mol → 0.2 OH-.

So yes, that's correct.

So the correct enthalpy is approximately -2.74 kcal, so option A is the closest. So the answer should be A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when 500 mL 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL 0.3 M H₂SO₄, and 200 mL 0.5 M Ba(OH)₂ are mixed, the following steps are performed:

1. **Calculate moles of H⁺ from acids:**
   - **HCl:**  
     Moles of HCl = \( 0.2 \, \text{M} \times 0.5 \, \text{L} = 0.1 \, \text{mol} \).  
     Since HCl is a strong acid, it contributes \( 0.1 \, \text{mol} \, \text{H}^+ \).
   - **H₂SO₄:**  
     Moles of H₂SO₄ = \( 0.3 \, \text{M} \times 0.3 \, \text{L} = 0.09 \, \text{mol} \).  
     As H₂SO₄ is diprotic, it contributes \( 0.09 \times 2 = 0.18 \, \text{mol} \, \text{H}^+ \).
   - **Total H⁺ from acids:**  
     \( 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 \, \text{mol} \, \text{H}^+ \).

2. **Calculate moles of OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂:**
   - Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = \( 0.5 \, \text{M} \times 0.2 \, \text{L} = 0.1 \, \text{mol} \).  
     Each mole of Ba(OH)₂ dissociates into 2 moles of OH⁻, so it contributes \( 0.1 \times 2 = 0.2 \, \text{mol} \, \text{OH}^- \).

3. **Determine the limiting reagent:**
   - The reaction between \( \text{H}^+ \) and \( \text{OH}^- \) is \( 1:1 \).  
     Total \( \text{H}^+ = 0.28 \, \text{mol} \), and total \( \text{OH}^- = 0.2 \, \text{mol} \).  
     Since \( \text{OH}^- \) is the limiting reagent, only \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \, \text{H}^+ \) will react.

4. **Calculate the enthalpy change:**
   - The standard enthalpy of neutralization is \( \Delta H = -57.3 \, \text{kJ/mol} \) per mole of \( \text{H}^+ \) neutralized.  
     For \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \, \text{H}^+ \), the enthalpy change is:  
     \[
     \Delta H = 0.2 \times (-57.3) = -11.46 \, \text{kJ}.
     \]

5. **Convert to kilocalories (if required):**
   - \( 1 \, \text{kJ} = 0.239 \, \text{kcal} \).  
     \[
     -11.46 \, \text{kJ} \times 0.239 = -2.74 \, \text{kcal}.
     \]

6. **Compare with the options:**
   - **Option A:** \( -2.72 \, \text{kcal} \) is very close to the calculated value of \( -2.74 \, \text{kcal} \).  
   - **Option B:** \( -11.42 \, \text{kcal} \) corresponds to approximately \( 47.7 \, \text{kJ} \), which is inconsistent with the calculation.  
   - **Option D:** \( -16.0 \, \text{kJ} \) is also inconsistent with the calculated value of \( -11.46 \, \text{kJ} \).

Thus, the correct answer is **Option A**, as it is the closest to the calculated value in kilocalories.

Answer: A
