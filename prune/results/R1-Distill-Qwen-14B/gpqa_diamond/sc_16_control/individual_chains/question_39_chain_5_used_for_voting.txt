Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the setup is about a particle in a tube, moving along the x-axis. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Wait, no, actually, the wave function is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) multiplied by some imaginary unit, right? Because the equation is written as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5*i. Oh wait, no, maybe that's not the case. Let me see the question again.

Wait, the wave function is written as ( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) - 0.5*i. So, is that a real and imaginary part? Like, the wave function is a complex number with real part (a/sqrt(1+x)) and imaginary part -0.5? Or is it a sum, like the real part is (a/sqrt(1+x)) minus 0.5i? Hmm, maybe I should parse that correctly. Oh wait, probably the entire term is (a / sqrt(1+x)) multiplied by (1 - 0.5i). Because the way it's written, it's (a/sqrt(1+x)) minus 0.5i, but perhaps that's a typo and it's supposed to be multiplied. Or perhaps the wave function is (a/(sqrt(1+x))) multiplied by (1 - 0.5i). Hmm, but the way it's written is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. That might mean it's a complex function where the real part is a/sqrt(1+x), and the imaginary part is -0.5. But that seems a bit strange because usually, the wave function would have a more complex form.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5 i. So the entire expression is that. So the wave function is a complex number where the real part is (a/sqrt(1+x)) and the imaginary part is -0.5. Wait, that's a bit odd because the imaginary part is a constant. But let's proceed.

The problem says that each system is under the same conditions, and when they measure the position, the particles are only found between x=1 and x=3. So the wave function must be normalized such that the probability is 1 in this interval, and zero outside. But wait, the wave function given is for a part of space where the particle can exist, and the measurements show that they are only found between 1 and 3. So the wave function is zero outside of this region.

Wait, but the wave function given is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. So if the wave function is zero outside x <1 and x>3, then for x <1, the wave function is zero. So the given expression must be non-zero only between x=1 and x=3.

Wait, but the expression is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. If that's the case, then the wave function is non-zero only where the real part is non-zero and the imaginary part is non-zero. But in this case, the real part is a/sqrt(1+x), which is real, and the imaginary part is -0.5, which is a constant. Hmm, but that would mean the wave function doesn't go to zero outside x=1 and x=3. Because the real part is a/sqrt(1+x), which is non-zero for x > -1, but the imaginary part is always -0.5. So that can't be right. So maybe my initial understanding is wrong.

Wait, perhaps the wave function is written as a/(sqrt(1+x)) multiplied by e^{-0.5i}, which would make it a complex wave. But the way it's written in the question is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5*i. So maybe the wave function is (a/(sqrt(1+x))) multiplied by (1 - 0.5i). Oh, perhaps the question has a typo, but I have to work with what's given.

Alternatively, perhaps the wave function is (a/(sqrt(1+x))) * (1 - 0.5i), which would make it a complex function. But perhaps the way it's written is (a/sqrt(1+x)) times (1 - 0.5i). Or maybe the entire thing is (a/sqrt(1+x)) minus 0.5i. Hmm. Well, regardless, I think the key is that the wave function is non-zero only between x=1 and x=3, and zero elsewhere. So the given expression must represent the wave function in that region, and be zero outside. But wait, the way the problem is phrased says that each particle can be found only between x=1 and x=3. So the wave function must be zero outside that region. Therefore, perhaps the given wave function is only valid for x between 1 and 3, and is zero elsewhere.

So, the wave function is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i for 1 ≤ x ≤3, and zero otherwise. Wait, but if the wave function is zero outside 1 and 3, then the integral over all space of the probability density must be 1.

The probability density is the square of the absolute value of the wave function. So |ψ(x)|².

Let me compute this. So ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So |ψ(x)|² is (a²/(1+x)) + (0.5)^2, because (a/sqrt(1+x)) is real, and 0.5i is imaginary. So the square would be real part squared plus imaginary part squared. So (a²/(1+x)) + 0.25.

Wait, but that would mean the probability density is (a²/(1+x)) + 0.25. But integrating this from x=1 to x=3 must give 1.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the integral of (a²/(1+x) + 0.25) from 1 to 3 would be a^2 ln(2) + 0.25*(2) ) = 1. But let me calculate that.

Wait, let's compute the integral. The integral from 1 to 3 of [ (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx.

The integral of 1/(1+x) dx is ln(1+x). So the first term is a² [ ln(4) - ln(2) ] = a² ln(2).

The second term is 0.25*(3-1) = 0.5.

So the total integral is a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So, a² ln(2) = 0.5 → a² = 0.5 / ln(2)

Then, a = sqrt(0.5 / ln(2)).

Let me calculate this numerically.

First, ln(2) is approximately 0.6931.

0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7206.

Then sqrt(0.7206) ≈ 0.8488.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.85, which is close. So the answer would be B) 0.85.

Wait, but wait another moment. Earlier, I assumed that the wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) minus 0.5i, which I considered as a real and imaginary part, but perhaps I got the wave function wrong. Let me re-examine the problem.

The wave function is written as (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5 i. So that can be written as (a/(sqrt(1+x))) ) + (-0.5) i. So in this case, the real part is a/(sqrt(1+x)), and the imaginary part is -0.5. So the wave function is a complex number with real and imaginary components.

So the probability density is |ψ|^2 = [a/(sqrt(1+x))]^2 + (0.5)^2. Which is a²/(1+x) + 0.25.

Wait, but earlier when I calculated the integral, I did that. So the integral from 1 to 3 of [a²/(1+x) + 0.25] dx must be 1.

So that gives the equation a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1 → a² ln(2) = 0.5 → a² = 0.5 / ln(2) → a ≈ sqrt(0.5/0.6931) ≈ sqrt(0.7206) ≈ 0.8488 → approximately 0.85, which is option B.

But wait, another thought: perhaps the wave function is given as (a/(sqrt(1+x))) multiplied by (1 - 0.5i). Because the way it's written, it's (a/(sqrt(1+x))) - 0.5i. Oh wait, perhaps the entire term is multiplied by (1 - 0.5i), making it a complex function.

So ψ(x) = a/(sqrt(1+x)) * (1 - 0.5i).

In that case, the probability density would be |ψ|^2 = (a/(sqrt(1+x)))^2 * |1 - 0.5i|^2.

What's |1 -0.5i|^2? It's (1)^2 + (0.5)^2 = 1 + 0.25 = 1.25.

So |ψ|^2 = (a²/(1+x)) * 1.25.

Then the integral from 1 to 3 of (a² * 1.25)/(1+x) dx = 1.

Compute that integral.

The integral of 1/(1+x) dx from 1 to 3 is ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(2). So:

1.25 a² * ln(2) =1 → a² = 1/(1.25 ln(2)).

Compute 1.25 is 5/4, so 1/(5/4) = 4/5.

So a² = (4/5) / ln(2) → a² = 0.8 / 0.6931 ≈ 1.1547 → a ≈ sqrt(1.1547) ≈ 1.0746.

But that's not one of the options. The options are A)1.1, B)0.85, C)0.35, D)0.6.

Wait, 1.0746 is close to 1.1, which is option A. But earlier calculation when the wave function is considered as real and imaginary parts gives a=0.85, which is option B.

So which interpretation is correct? Is the wave function ψ(x) = [a/(sqrt(1+x))] - 0.5i, or ψ(x) = a/(sqrt(1+x)) multiplied by (1-0.5i)?

The way it's written in the problem is the first case: (a / sqrt(1 + x) ) - 0.5*i.

So the real part is a/sqrt(1+x), and the imaginary part is -0.5. So the earlier calculation leading to a≈0.85 (option B) is correct.

Wait, but that's only valid if the wave function is zero outside the region x between 1 and 3. So the given wave function is valid only within that region, and zero elsewhere.

But wait, in the given wave function, the real part is a/sqrt(1+x) which, for x >1, is a positive real number. So in the region x<1, the wave function is zero, as per the problem statement. So, yes, the wave function is non-zero only between x=1 and x=3. So the calculation holds.

So the correct value of a would be approximately 0.85, which is option B.

To determine the value of \( a \), we analyze the given wave function \( \psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i \). The problem states that particles are only found between \( x=1 \) and \( x=3 \), meaning the wave function is zero outside this region. The probability density is given by \( |\psi(x)|^2 \), which is the square of the absolute value of the wave function.

### Step 1: Compute \( |\psi(x)|^2 \)
The wave function has a real part \( \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} \) and an imaginary part \( -0.5 \). The probability density is:
\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (-0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25
\]

### Step 2: Normalize the wave function
The total probability must integrate to 1 over the region \( x=1 \) to \( x=3 \):
\[
\int_1^3 \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1
\]

#### Integrate \( \frac{a^2}{1+x} \):
\[
\int_1^3 \frac{a^2}{1+x} dx = a^2 \int_1^3 \frac{1}{1+x} dx = a^2 \ln(1+x) \Big|_1^3 = a^2 \ln(4) - a^2 \ln(2) = a^2 \ln(2)
\]

#### Integrate \( 0.25 \):
\[
\int_1^3 0.25 dx = 0.25 \cdot (3-1) = 0.5
\]

#### Combine results:
\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1
\]

### Step 3: Solve for \( a \)
Rearranging:
\[
a^2 \ln(2) = 0.5 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}
\]

Using \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \):
\[
a^2 = \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7206 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a \approx \sqrt{0.7206} \approx 0.8488
\]

### Step 4: Match with options
The closest value to \( a \approx 0.8488 \) is \( 0.85 \), which corresponds to option **B**.

### Final Answer:
The value of \( a \) is approximately \( 0.85 \).
