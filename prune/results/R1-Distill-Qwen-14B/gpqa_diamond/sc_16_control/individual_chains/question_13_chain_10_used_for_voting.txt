Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reaction mechanisms. Let's break it down step by step.

The starting material is (R)-(+)-Limonene. I remember that limonene is a cyclic monoterpene, specifically a bicyclic monoterpene. The (R) configuration suggests it's the enantiomer with a specific spatial arrangement. I think limonene has a structure similar to menthol but without the hydroxyl group. Wait, no, limonene is actually a terpene alcohol, but wait no, wait—actually, no, I think limonene is an alkene. Oh right, limonene is a bicyclic monoterpene with a double bond. The structure is something like a cyclohexene ring with a methyl group and a substituent, maybe?

So the first reaction is treating limonene with Pd/C under hydrogen. That sounds like hydrogenation. Adding hydrogen to a double bond. Since it's a hydrogenation reaction, the double bond in limonene would be reduced. But wait, limonene has two double bonds—wait no, limonene is a bicyclic monoterpene, which probably has one double bond. So hydrogenation would add H2 across the double bond.

Wait, but the question says after 1 equivalent of hydrogen is consumed, product 1 is isolated. So it's a partial hydrogenation? Or maybe it's a complete hydrogenation but only using one equivalent. Hmm, but for each double bond, you need one equivalent of H2. So if the starting material has one double bond, adding 1 equivalent would saturate it, turning it into a single bond. So product 1 would be the fully hydrogenated limonene, which would be a bicyclic structure with no double bonds.

Wait, limonene is (R)-(+)-limonene. So the structure is a cyclohexene ring, right? No, wait, limonene is actually a bicyclic monoterpene with two rings—like a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene structure, I think. So when hydrogenated, it would become bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane. But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on this. Alternatively, perhaps limonene is a cyclic monoterpene with a single double bond, so hydrogenation would add hydrogen across that.

After hydrogenation, product 1 is formed. Then, product 1 is treated with 3-chloroperbenzoic acid (mCPBA), which is a peracid. I remember that peracids are oxidizing agents and can epoxidize alkenes. But wait, if product 1 is the hydrogenated product, which has no double bonds, then treating with mCPBA wouldn't do anything. That can't be right. So maybe I got the first step wrong.

Wait, maybe the hydrogenation isn't of a double bond but something else. Or perhaps the starting material has an epoxide, but no, limonene is an alkene. Hmm, let me think again.

Wait, maybe the hydrogenation is reducing a ketone or something else. No, limonene doesn't have a ketone; it's a terpene. So perhaps I'm missing something. Oh wait, maybe limonene is a diene. Wait, I think limonene is a bicyclic monoterpene with a single double bond, so hydrogenation would convert it into a single bond.

Wait, but if that's the case, product 1 would be a fully hydrogenated product. Then treating with mCPBA wouldn't have any effect because there are no double bonds. So that can't be right. Hmm, maybe the first step isn't hydrogenation. Wait, no, Pd/C under hydrogen is definitely hydrogenation.

Wait, perhaps the hydrogenation isn't saturating the double bond but maybe adding something else. No, I think it's hydrogenation of the double bond. So limonene's structure is a cyclohexene ring with substituents—like a methyl group and perhaps an isopropyl group.

Wait, maybe I should sketch this out mentally. (R)-Limonene is a cyclic monoterpene, I think it's a bicyclo structure. Let me think, limonene is (R) configuration, so the structure is bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene, something like that. When hydrogenated, it becomes bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane, a saturated bicyclic structure. So that's product 1.

Then product 1 is treated with mCPBA. But wait, product 1 is a saturated compound, so mCPBA can't epoxidize anything. Hmm, that's confusing. Maybe I'm wrong about the first step.

Wait, another possibility: could the hydrogenation have been incomplete, leaving some double bonds? But the question says 1 equivalent of hydrogen is consumed, which suggests that all the possible double bonds are hydrogenated. So product 1 is fully hydrogenated.

Wait, but if that's the case, then step two wouldn't do anything, which can't be right because the question says product 2 is formed. So perhaps I'm miscalculating the first step.

Wait, perhaps the starting material isn't limonene but another compound. No, the question says it's a methanol solution of (R)-(+)-Limonene. So maybe the limonene is in methanol, and the hydrogenation is under certain conditions. Wait, methanol and hydrogen with Pd/C—maybe it's a hydrogenation of something else, like a ketone to an alcohol, but no, limonene doesn't have a ketone.

Wait, maybe the initial step is a hydrogenolysis, like removing a protecting group. Wait, limonene is an alkene, so hydrogenation would add H2 across the double bond.

Wait, perhaps limonene has a double bond in a ring, and hydrogenation would hydrogenate that, but I'm not sure. Let me think of the structure of limonene. Oh, I think limonene is a cyclic monoterpene with a double bond between carbons 2 and 3 of a cyclohexene ring. So when hydrogenated, the double bond becomes a single bond, and the ring becomes cyclohexane.

So product 1 is cyclohexane with substituents, perhaps a methyl group and an isopropyl group. Then, treating with mCPBA. Wait, but if product 1 is hydrogenated, no double bonds, so mCPBA can't epoxidize. So that's a problem.

Wait, unless I'm wrong about the first step. Maybe the hydrogenation isn't of the double bond but of a different group. But limonene doesn't have any other groups except methyl and maybe hydroxyl? Oh no, limonene is a hydrocarbon. So it can't be anything else.

Wait, perhaps the first step is removing a substituent. No, I don't think so. So maybe I'm missing something else.

Hmm, perhaps the limonene is being hydrogenated, but only the double bond is hydrogenated, and maybe another group is affected. Wait, maybe that's not the case. Alternatively, perhaps the first step is a reduction of a carbonyl group, but limonene doesn't have that.

Alternatively, maybe the limonene is being reduced, but in such a way that it forms an alcohol. Wait, limonene is a terpene, maybe it's a bicyclic monoterpene with a double bond. So hydrogenation would give a bicyclic alkane.

But then, after that, product 1 is treated with mCPBA, which is an oxidizing agent used for epoxidation. But without a double bond, that can't happen. So perhaps the initial step isn't hydrogenation. That can't be, because the question says Pd/C and H2. So maybe I'm wrong about the structure of limonene.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps limonene is a diastereomer, or something else. Hmm. I might need to look up the structure of limonene. Oh wait, in an exam setting, I can't do that, so I have to proceed with what I know.

Alternatively, perhaps the hydrogenation is partial, but that would require a diene, which limonene isn't. So another approach: perhaps the hydrogenation is not of the main double bond but of a different part of the molecule. Maybe limonene has an epoxide or another functional group, but no. So I'm stuck here.

Wait, maybe the first step isn't hydrogenation. Wait, no, the question clearly states it's Pd/C under hydrogen. So I think I'm right that it's hydrogenation. Then perhaps there's an error in my assumption about the reaction conditions. Hmm.

Wait, could the hydrogenation be in a different solvent? The question says a methanol solution, so perhaps it's a catalytic hydrogenation in MeOH. So limonene is dissolved in MeOH with Pd/C and H2. So hydrogenation of the double bond to form cyclohexane derivatives.

So after hydrogenation, product 1 is the hydrogenated limonene. Then, when treated with mCPBA, which is an epoxidizing agent, but product 1 is saturated. So that can't be. Therefore, perhaps I'm wrong, and the first step doesn't hydrogenate the double bond.

Wait, wait, another possibility—maybe the limonene is hydrogenated to form a diol. But no, hydrogenation would add H2 across the double bond, giving a single bond, not an alcohol.

Wait, perhaps the hydrogenation is a hydrogenolysis of a protecting group. Oh, wait, limonene is a cyclic monoterpene, which doesn't have any protecting groups. So I'm back to square one.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the next steps and see if that gives me any clues.

After product 2 is formed by treating product 1 with mCPBA, product 2 is treated with sodium methoxide, giving product 3. Then, product 3 is treated with propanoic acid, DCC (dicyclohexylcarbodiimide), and 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP), which are reagents used for forming esters, probably via the DCC coupling, which is a common method to activate carboxylic acids for esterification.

So, the last step is forming an ester. So product 3 must have a hydroxyl group that will react with propanoic acid to form an ester.

Let me go back. If product 3 has a hydroxyl group, then product 2 must have something that, when treated with sodium methoxide, forms an alcohol.

Wait, product 2 is treated with sodium methoxide to form product 3. Sodium methoxide is a strong base, so perhaps it's deprotonating something, maybe an epoxide. Wait, but if product 2 has an epoxide, then treating with a base like NaOme would cause ring-opening.

Wait, but product 2 is made by treating product 1 with mCPBA. So if product 1 is a saturated compound, mCPBA can't epoxidize it. So that's a contradiction. So maybe product 1 is a diene, but that doesn't fit with limonene's structure.

Wait, maybe I'm wrong about the first step. Let me think differently. Maybe the starting material is limonene oxide, but no, the question says limonene.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step is a catalytic hydrogenation that doesn't hydrogenate the double bond but does something else. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the first step is a reduction that doesn't involve the double bond. Wait, limonene has a carbonyl group? No, limonene is a cyclic monoterpene, a hydrocarbon, so no functional groups beyond that. So hydrogenation would add H2 across the double bond.

Wait, perhaps limonene is a terpene with a cyclic ether? No, I think limonene is a hydrocarbon with a double bond.

This is getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should proceed to the next steps and see if I can find a pattern.

Assuming that after the first step, product 1 is hydrogenated, and then product 2 is an epoxide. But that's impossible unless product 1 has a double bond. So perhaps the first step isn't hydrogenating the limonene but something else. Wait, but the starting material is limonene.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe the hydrogenation is not of the double bond in limonene but elsewhere, perhaps a protecting group. But limonene doesn't have protecting groups.

Alternatively, perhaps limonene is hydrogenated in a way that forms a secondary alcohol. Wait, but that would require a ketone, which limonene doesn't have. So that's not possible.

Wait, perhaps the initial step is not hydrogenation but something else. But the reagents clearly suggest hydrogenation.

Wait, I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for another approach. Let's think about the options given and see if any of them can guide me.

The options are all cyclohexyl propionate derivatives. So product 4 is an ester of propanoic acid with a cyclohexyl alcohol. So product 3 must be the corresponding alcohol, which would have a hydroxyl group.

Product 3 comes from treating product 2 with sodium methoxide. So perhaps product 2 has a tosylate or another good leaving group, and the base causes elimination or substitution. Alternatively, product 2 could be an epoxide, and the base opens it.

Wait, if product 2 is an epoxide, then treating it with a base like NaOme would cause ring-opening. In an epoxide ring-opening under basic conditions, the nucleophile (methoxide) would attack the less substituted carbon, leading to an alcohol and a carbanion, which would be protonated.

But wait, product 1 must have a double bond for mCPBA to form an epoxide. So if product 1 has a double bond, that suggests that the first step didn't hydrogenate it. But the first step was hydrogenation. Contradiction again.

Wait, maybe the hydrogenation is not adding H2 to the double bond but doing something else. Or perhaps the hydrogenation is incomplete, but that would require more than one equivalent of H2.

Wait, let me think again. Maybe the initial limonene has a double bond, which upon hydrogenation becomes a single bond, but then product 1 is treated with a strong acid or base to form an epoxide. No, mCPBA is an oxidizing agent, but it's used for epoxidation, which requires a double bond. So perhaps product 1 still has a double bond.

Wait, maybe the first step isn't hydrogenating the double bond. Like, perhaps the starting material is a diene, and hydrogenation only partially saturates it. But limonene isn't a diene, as far as I know.

Hmm, perhaps I should think of limonene as a specific structure. Limonene is a bicyclic monoterpene with a double bond. Its structure is bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene. So when hydrogenated, it becomes bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane.

Then product 1 is the hydrogenated limonene, which is a bicyclic alkane. Then, treatment with mCPBA wouldn't do anything. So that can't be.

Wait, unless the hydrogenation hasn't saturated all the double bonds. But limonene has only one double bond, I think.

I'm stuck. Maybe I should think that the first step produces a different compound. Alternatively, perhaps the hydrogenation is not of the double bond but of a different functional group, but limonene doesn't have one.

Wait, another approach: the question says that product 4 is formed by treating product 3 with propanoic acid, DCC, and DMAP. These reagents are for forming an ester from an alcohol and a carboxylic acid. So product 3 must have an alcohol group.

Product 3 comes from treating product 2 with sodium methoxide. So product 2 must have a leaving group that, upon treatment with a base, forms an alcohol. Alternatively, product 2 could be an epoxide, which upon ring-opening with a base would form an alcohol.

But again, for product 2 to be an epoxide, product 1 must have a double bond. So product 1 must have a double bond, which implies that the first step didn't hydrogenate it, which is confusing because the reagents suggest hydrogenation.

Wait, maybe the first step doesn't hydrogenate the double bond but something else. Or perhaps the hydrogenation is catalytic and doesn't proceed because of steric hindrance. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material isn't limonene but a derivative. But the question says it is limonene.

Alternatively, maybe the hydrogenation is a transfer hydrogenation, but that's less likely here.

I think I'm stuck on the first step, so perhaps I'll proceed to the next steps and see if I can find a pattern.

Assuming that product 2 is an epoxide, product 2 would have an epoxide ring. Then treating with sodium methoxide would open the epoxide. Under basic conditions, the nucleophile (methoxide) would attack the less substituted epoxide carbon, leading to an alcohol and a leaving group.

Wait, but opening an epoxide with a base would typically form a diol, but under specific conditions, it might form an alcohol and another product. Alternatively, perhaps the epoxide is part of a ring that, when opened, forms an alcohol in a specific position.

Then, product 3 would have an alcohol group, which would react with propanoic acid in the presence of DCC and DMAP to form an ester.

Looking at the options, all are propionates, meaning the ester is from propanoic acid. So product 4 is an ester where the alcohol part is a cyclohexyl derivative.

So the key is figuring out the structure leading to one of these options.

But perhaps I should think about the stereochemistry. The starting compound is (R)-limonene. So the configuration after each step would influence the final product.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial hydrogenation is not of the limonene but a different site, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the initial step is a hydrogenolysis of a protecting group, but limonene doesn't have that.

Another angle: Maybe the hydrogenation isn't the first step but a later step. No, the question says the first step is hydrogenation.

Wait, perhaps the initial step doesn't hydrogenate the double bond but something else. Let me think again.

Wait, limonene is a cyclic monoterpene with a specific configuration. If it's hydrogenated, the product would have the same configuration but without the double bond. So the hydrogenation would add two hydrogens across the double bond.

But then, mCPBA can't form an epoxide. So perhaps I'm wrong about the first step.

Wait, maybe the hydrogenation isn't of the double bond but of a benzylic or allylic position. But limonene's structure doesn't have that.

Alternatively, perhaps the hydrogenation is a hydrogen shift or something else. I'm not certain.

At this point, maybe it's better to think about each reagent's effect and see if I can reverse-engineer the steps.

Product 4 is an ester formed from product 3 and propanoic acid. Product 3 comes from product 2 treated with NaOme. Product 2 comes from product 1 treated with mCPBA. Product 1 comes from limonene treated with H2 and Pd/C.

So, product 1 must have a structure that, when treated with mCPBA, forms product 2, which upon treatment with NaOme gives product 3, which is then esterified.

Wait, if product 2 is an epoxide, then product 1 must have a double bond. But product 1 is after hydrogenation, which would have no double bonds. So this is a contradiction.

Hmm, so perhaps product 1 is not a hydrogenated product. Maybe the first step is a reduction of a carbonyl group. But limonene doesn't have a carbonyl group. So I'm stuck.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe the initial step is a dihydrogenation that adds H2 across a single bond, but that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the hydrogenation isn't acting on the main double bond but somewhere else. Alternatively, maybe the hydrogenation is a catalytic transfer hydrogenation, but I don't think that applies here.

This is getting me nowhere, so perhaps I need to think about the options and see which structure could form through these steps.

Option A: (1S,2S,4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate.

Option B: (1S,2R,4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate.

Option C: (1S,2S,5R)-5-isopropyl-2-methoxy-2-methylcyclohexyl propionate.

Option D: 1-methoxy-2-((S)-4-methylcyclohex-3-en-1-yl)propan-2-yl propionate.

Looking at these, options A and B have similar structures, with substituents at positions 1,2,4 on the cyclohexane. Option C has substituents at 2 and 5. Option D has a cyclohexene ring, which suggests an unsaturated ring, which would require that the last step didn't hydrogenate the ring.

Wait, but product 4 is formed after the hydrogenation step. So if option D has a cyclohexene ring, that implies that the hydrogenation didn't occur, which is conflicting with the first step.

Hmm, so perhaps the correct product has a saturated ring, like options A, B, or C.

Looking at the steps, the last step forms an ester from product 3, which is an alcohol.

Assuming that product 3 is a cyclohexanol derivative, when esterified with propanoic acid, it becomes a cyclohexyl propionate.

Now, considering the stereochemistry. The starting material is (R)-limonene, which after hydrogenation would retain its configuration but without the double bond.

But since I'm not entirely sure, perhaps I should think about the possible products.

Wait, another approach: maybe the initial hydrogenation isn't of limonene but of a ring-opening product. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step adds H2 across a double bond, creating a cyclohexane ring with substituents. Then, when treated with mCPBA, it would have to have a double bond, which it doesn't. So that's a problem.

Wait, unless the first step doesn't hydrogenate the main double bond but another one. But limonene doesn't have more than one double bond.

I think I'm stuck and need to make an educated guess based on the options.

Looking at option D, it has a cyclohexene ring. Since the first step is hydrogenation, which would have made it saturated, this is unlikely unless the hydrogenation didn't affect that ring, but that doesn't make sense.

Options A and B have substituents at positions 1, 2, and 4. The (R) configuration in limonene would influence the positions of these substituents.

Another thought: perhaps the first step is hydrogenation of a specific substituent, leading to a diol, which upon epoxidation isn't possible, but this is unclear.

Alternatively, maybe the first step is a transfer hydrogenation, which doesn't saturate the double bond but modifies substituents.

Wait, perhaps the initial hydrogenation adds hydrogen to a methyl group, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the initial step isn't hydrogenation but something else. Wait, but the reagents are Pd/C and H2, which are for hydrogenation.

Well, considering I'm stuck on the first step, maybe I should look for another approach. Perhaps the reaction sequence is leading to a specific ester.

The correct answer is one of the four options, and from the steps, it's an ester derived from a cyclohexanol derivative.

Since the first step is hydrogenation, perhaps the starting limonene has a double bond that, when hydrogenated, leads to a structure that can form an epoxide upon oxidation. But that doesn't make sense because hydrogenation would remove the double bond.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial hydrogenation is a dihydrogenation, but that's not feasible.

Wait, maybe the first step isn't hydrogenation but something else, but the question says it is.

At this point, I think I need to proceed to the conclusion, even if I'm not entirely sure.

The most likely answer is option B or A, given the configurations, but I'm not certain.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves a multi-step reaction sequence starting with (R)-(+)-limonene. The first step is hydrogenation using Pd/C under a hydrogen atmosphere. Limonene is a bicyclic monoterpene with a double bond, and hydrogenation would typically saturate this double bond, forming a bicyclic alkane. However, this would result in a saturated compound, which would prevent subsequent epoxidation by mCPBA in the next step. This creates a contradiction, as mCPBA requires a double bond to form an epoxide.

Despite this ambiguity, the sequence continues. Product 1 is treated with mCPBA, which suggests that product 1 must still have a double bond. This implies that the hydrogenation step either did not fully saturate the double bond or acted on a different part of the molecule. Product 2, formed after mCPBA treatment, is then subjected to sodium methoxide, likely leading to epoxide ring-opening or another transformation. Product 3, formed from this step, contains a hydroxyl group, which reacts with propanoic acid, DCC, and DMAP in the final step to form an ester.

The options provided are all cyclohexyl propionate derivatives, indicating that product 4 is an ester derived from a cyclohexanol structure. The stereochemistry of the starting material, (R)-(+)-limonene, influences the configuration of the final product. Based on the reaction sequence and the options, the most plausible answer is a cyclohexyl propionate with specific stereochemistry at positions 1, 2, and 4.

After analyzing the options and considering the reaction sequence, the correct answer is:

**Answer: B**
