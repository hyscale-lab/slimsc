Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking about the mean decay distance of a meson X. The given parameters are E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are A to D, with various values in the order of 10^-15 or 10^-16 meters.

Wait, I remember that the mean lifetime of a particle is related to its decay width. The decay width Γ is connected to the lifetime τ by the equation Γ = ħ / τ, right? So τ is ħ divided by Γ. Oh wait, no, wait. I think Γ is the total decay width, and Γ = ħ / τ, so τ = ħ / Γ. Because the uncertainty principle, the width is related to the lifetime inversely.

But wait, the problem is about decay distance, not lifetime. So after finding the lifetime, I need to find how far the meson travels before decaying. That depends on its speed and lifetime. The mean decay distance, I think, is the product of the particle's speed (v) and its lifetime (τ). So distance = v * τ.

But how do I find the speed? Oh, relativistic mechanics. Since the production energy E_X is given as 8 GeV, and the rest mass is 1.2 GeV, I can find the velocity using the energy. E is the total energy, which is gamma * m c². So gamma = E / (m c²). Let me compute that.

Wait, E_X is 8 GeV, m_X is 1.2 GeV. So gamma = 8 / 1.2 ≈ 6.6667. So the Lorentz factor is about 6.6667.

Then, gamma is also equal to 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So I can solve for v. Let me rearrange that:

gamma² = 1 / (1 - v²/c²)
=> 1 - v²/c² = 1 / gamma²
=> v²/c² = 1 - 1/gamma²
=> v = c * sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²)

Plugging in gamma ≈ 6.6667. Let's compute 1/gamma²: 1/(44.4444) ≈ 0.0225. Then 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. The square root of that is sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887. So v ≈ 0.9887 c. So about 98.87% the speed of light. That makes sense for high-energy particles.

So now, the lifetime tau is ħ / Γ. Wait, the units here are important. ħ is the reduced Planck constant, approximately 6.582 x 10^-25 GeV·s. Γ is given in MeV, so I need to convert it to GeV. Γ_X is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV.

So tau = ħ / Γ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) = (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25 s. Let me compute that: 6.582 / 0.32 is about 20.56875. So tau ≈ 20.56875e-25 s? Wait, no, 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32 is (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25 = approx 20.56875e-25 seconds. Wait, no: 6.582 /0.32 is 20.56875, so it's 20.56875e-25 seconds? Wait, no, wait: 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = (6.582 /0.32) * 1e-25. So 6.582 /0.32 is 20.56875, so 20.56875e-25 seconds. That's 2.056875e-24 seconds? Wait, no. 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32 is (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25 s. So 6.582 /0.32 is approximately 20.56875, so 20.56875e-25 s. Oh, wait no, 20.56875 multiplied by 1e-25 is 2.056875e-24 s? No, wait: 20.56875e-25 is the same as 2.056875e-24 s? Because 20e-25 is 2e-24. Right.

So tau ≈ 2.057e-24 seconds.

Now, the decay distance is v * tau. v is approximately 0.9887 c. c is about 3e8 meters per second.

So distance = 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s * 2.057e-24 s.

Let me compute that step by step. First, 0.9887 *3e8 = approximately 2.966e8 m/s.

Multiply by 2.057e-24 s:

2.966e8 * 2.057e-24 = (2.966 * 2.057) * 1e-16.

What's 2.966 * 2.057? Let me calculate:

2.966 * 2 = 5.932
2.966 * 0.057 = approx 0.168
So total approx 6.100.

So approximately 6.1 * 1e-16 meters. Wait, but that's not matching any of the options.

Wait, wait, did I make a mistake in the calculation? Let me check the numbers again.

Wait, gamma is E_X / m_X c². Wait, E_X is 8 GeV, and m_X is 1.2 GeV, so gamma is 8 /1.2 ≈6.6667. That part seems right.

Then, velocity calculation: sqrt(1 - 1/(gamma^2)) = sqrt(1 -1/(44.4444)) = sqrt(1-0.0225)=sqrt(0.9775)= approx 0.9887. So v=0.9887 c. Correct.

Then, lifetime tau: ħ is 6.582e-25 GeV·s, Γ is 0.32 GeV. So tau = (6.582e-25) / 0.32 = 2.0568e-24 seconds. Correct.

Then, distance: v * tau = 0.9887 c * tau.

So, 0.9887 *3e8 m/s * 2.0568e-24 s.

Let me compute 0.9887 *3e8 = approx 2.966e8 m/s.

Multiply by 2.0568e-24 s: 2.966e8 *2.0568e-24 = (2.966 *2.0568) * 1e-16.

Calculating 2.966 * 2.0568:

2 * 2 is 4, 2 * 0.0568 is ~0.1136, 0.966*2 is ~1.932, 0.966*0.0568≈0.0548.

Wait, perhaps a better approach: 2.966 * 2.0568.

Let me compute it as (3 - 0.034) * (2 + 0.0568) = 3*2 + 3*0.0568 - 0.034*2 -0.034*0.0568.

So 6 + 0.1704 - 0.068 - 0.0019312≈6 +0.1704=6.1704 -0.068=6.1024 -0.00193≈6.1005.

So approximately 6.1005e-16 meters.

Hmm, but the options are about 5e-15, 4e-15, etc. So this is way smaller than the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in units somewhere.

Wait, wait. Maybe I mixed up GeV and MeV in the calculation of tau. Let me double-check.

Gamma is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. So when I calculated tau = ħ/(Γ), that's correct. So 6.582e-25 GeV·s / 0.32 GeV = 2.0568e-24 seconds. That's correct.

Wait, but wait: the relation between decay width and lifetime. I might have it backwards. Because I thought τ = ħ / Γ. Alternatively, perhaps it's Γ = ħ * something else.

Wait, another approach: Γ is the decay width, and in natural units (ħ=1, c=1), the lifetime is τ = 1/(Γ), but when you include ħ, it's τ = ħ / Γ. So that part should be correct.

Hmm, but according to my calculation, the decay distance is about 6e-16 meters. But the options are about 4e-15 and 5e-15. So I'm off by a factor of about 10.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the velocity calculation. Let me reassess.

Wait, gamma is 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 6.6667. So to find beta (v/c):

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta^2).

So beta = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)).

gamma squared is (8/1.2)^2 = (6.6667)^2 ≈44.4444.

So 1/gamma^2 = 1/44.4444 ≈ 0.0225.

So 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. sqrt(0.9775) is approximately 0.9887. So beta is ~0.9887. So v is 0.9887 c. That seems right.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation of the product in the distance. Let me recompute 0.9887 *3e8 *2.0568e-24.

Compute 0.9887 *3e8 = 2.9661e8 m/s.

Multiply by 2.0568e-24 s:

2.9661e8 * 2.0568e-24 = (2.9661 * 2.0568) * 1e-16.

Compute 2.9661 * 2.0568:

Let me calculate this more accurately.

2.9661 * 2 = 5.9322.

2.9661 * 0.0568 = ?

0.0568 * 2000 = 113.6, but 2.9661 is about 3000, but wait, 2.9661 *0.0568:

Let me compute 2.9661 × 0.05 = 0.148305.

2.9661 × 0.0068 = approximately 0.01997.

So total is approximately 0.148305 + 0.01997 ≈ 0.168275.

So 2.9661 ×2.0568 ≈5.9322 +0.168275 =6.100475.

So 6.100475e-16 meters.

Hmm, that's about 6.1e-16 m. But the options are either about 4e-15 or 5e-15, which is an order of magnitude higher. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation of the total energy. Is E_X the total energy, or is it the kinetic energy? No, I think the problem states E_X is the production energy, which is the total energy. So E = gamma m c². So our gamma calculation is correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the units for ħ. Let's check.

The Planck constant ħ is approximately 6.582 ×10^-25 GeV·s. So when we have ħ in GeV·s units, and Γ is in GeV, then tau is in seconds. That part seems correct.

Wait another thought: the mean decay length is sometimes given by L = c * tau * beta. Because beta is v/c. So L = c * tau * (v/c) = tau * v. Wait, no—v = beta c, so tau*v = tau * beta c. So L = beta c * tau.

Wait, another way: L = (beta gamma) * (c tau) /c. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting myself confused. Let me think again.

Wait, tau is the lifetime in the particle's rest frame. The lab frame sees the lifetime as gamma multiplied by tau. Because of time dilation. So the lifetime in the lab frame is gamma * tau. So then, the decay distance is v * gamma tau.

Wait, wait! Oh! I think I made a mistake here. I used v * tau, but tau is the proper lifetime, not the dilated lifetime. So the correct lifetime in the lab frame is gamma * tau.

So, the lifetime in the lab frame is gamma * tau. So the decay distance is v multiplied by gamma tau.

Because in the lab frame, the particle's lifetime is longer by a factor of gamma. So I shouldn't have used tau, but gamma tau.

Ah! That must be where I went wrong. Because earlier, I used tau as the lifetime in the lab frame, but actually, tau is proper time, and the lab frame observes a longer lifetime.

So let's redo the calculation with this correction.

Tau = ħ / Γ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) ≈2.0568e-24 seconds.

Then, the lab frame lifetime is gamma * tau ≈6.6667 * 2.0568e-24 s ≈1.371e-23 s.

Then, the decay distance is v multiplied by this dilated lifetime.

v is 0.9887 c, which is 0.9887 *3e8 m/s ≈2.966e8 m/s.

So, decay distance L = v * gamma tau = 2.966e8 m/s * 1.371e-23 s.

Calculating that: 2.966e8 * 1.371e-23 = (2.966 *1.371) * 1e-15.

2.966 *1.371: Let's compute that.

2 *1.371 = 2.742.

0.966 *1.371 ≈1.321.

Adding up, approx 2.742 +1.321=4.063. Oh, wait, no: 2.966 is 2 +0.966.

So 2 *1.371=2.742, 0.966 *1.371: let me compute 0.966 * 1.371.

0.9 *1.371=1.2339.

0.066 *1.371 ≈0.090486.

Total: 1.2339 +0.090486 ≈1.3244.

So total is 2.742 +1.3244 =4.0664.

So L≈4.0664e-15 meters.

Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, and option C is 5.0223e-15 m.

So 4.066e-15 is very close to option B, which is 4.0655e-15 m.

So the correct answer should be option B.

To determine the mean decay distance of the meson resonance \( X \), we use the given parameters: production energy \( E_X = 8 \, \text{GeV} \), mass \( m_X = 1.2 \, \text{GeV} \), and decay width \( \Gamma_X = 320 \, \text{MeV} = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \). The mean decay distance is calculated as the product of the particle's velocity \( v \) and its lifetime \( \tau \) in the lab frame, where \( \tau = \gamma \tau_0 \) (accounting for time dilation). 

### Step 1: Calculate the Lorentz factor \( \gamma \)
The Lorentz factor is given by:
\[
\gamma = \frac{E_X}{m_X} = \frac{8}{1.2} \approx 6.6667
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the velocity \( v \)
Using the relation \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \), we solve for \( v \):
\[
v = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}}
\]
Substituting \( \gamma = 6.6667 \):
\[
v \approx 0.9887c
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the proper lifetime \( \tau_0 \)
The proper lifetime is related to the decay width by:
\[
\tau_0 = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma_X}
\]
Using \( \hbar \approx 6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV·s} \) and \( \Gamma_X = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \):
\[
\tau_0 = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-25}}{0.32} \approx 2.0568 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the lab-frame lifetime \( \tau \)
The lab-frame lifetime is dilated by a factor of \( \gamma \):
\[
\tau = \gamma \tau_0 = 6.6667 \times 2.0568 \times 10^{-24} \approx 1.371 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{s}
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the mean decay distance \( L \)
The mean decay distance is:
\[
L = v \tau = (0.9887c) \cdot \tau
\]
Substituting \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \) and \( \tau = 1.371 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{s} \):
\[
L = 0.9887 \cdot 3 \times 10^8 \cdot 1.371 \times 10^{-23}
\]
\[
L \approx 4.066 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}
\]

### Step 6: Match with the options
The calculated decay distance \( L \approx 4.066 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \) is closest to option **B**, which is \( 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \).

**Answer: B**
