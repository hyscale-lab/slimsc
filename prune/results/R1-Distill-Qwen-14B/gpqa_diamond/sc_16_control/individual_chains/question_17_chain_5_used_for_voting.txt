Okay, I have this chemistry problem in front of me. Let me read it carefully. The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution that contains a specific complex. Hmm, I remember that EDTA forms complexes with metal ions, and this is probably a complexation problem.

So the problem says the solution has 0.02 M stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. I think stoichiometric means the molar ratio is 1:1 between Ca²+ and EDTA^4-? Because EDTA typically complexes in a 1:1 ratio, right? Like each EDTA binds to one metal ion.

The pH is ideal, which probably means that the solution is such that EDTA is in its active form, the one that can complex with the metal. And the temperature is 25°C, but I don't think that affects the calculations here. The given K value is the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA =5x10^10. Wait, formation constants are usually denoted as Kf, so I guess that's Kf here.

I need to find the concentration of calcium ions. So, the complex dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-. The reaction would be like CaY²− ⇌ Ca²+ + Y^4−. But wait, wait. No, wait. The complex is Ca-EDTA. So the formula is probably CaY²−, meaning that the EDTA is in the form Y^4- when it's deprotonated enough. So the reaction for the complex dissociation is:

CaY²− ⇌ Ca²+ + Y^4−

But wait, if the complex is CaY²−, then when it dissociates, it releases Ca²+ and Y^4−. So the formation constant Kf is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. So Kf is [CaY²−]/([Ca²+][Y^4−]).

Wait, but if the solution is 0.02 M CaY²−, then initially, it's all complex, but in solution, some of it might dissociate. But since Kf is a very large number (5e10), which means that the complex is very stable and doesn't dissociate much. So the concentration of free Ca²+ ions will be very low.

So the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Let me set up the ICE table. Let's let s be the change in concentration of Ca²+ and Y^4−. The complex dissociates into Ca²+ and Y^4−.

Initial:
[CaY²−] = 0.02 M
[Ca²+] = 0
[Y^4−] =0

Change:
[CaY²−] decreases by s, so becomes 0.02 - s ≈ 0.02 (since s is very small)
[Ca²+] increases by s → s
[Y^4−] increases by s → s

Equilibrium:
[CaY²−] = 0.02 - s ≈ 0.02
[Ca²+] = s
[Y^4−] = s

So the Kf expression is Kf = [CaY²−]/( [Ca²+][Y^4−] )

Plugging the values:

5e10 = (0.02) / (s * s)
So 5e10 = 0.02 / s²
Solving for s²: s² = 0.02 / (5e10)
s² = 2e-3 /5e10 → which is 4e-13?

Wait, let me compute that again. 0.02 is 2e-2. So 2e-2 divided by 5e10 is (2e-2)/(5e10) = (2/(5)) * 1e-12) = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13.

Wait, no, 2e-2 /5e10 = (2/5) * 1e-12. Because when you divide exponents, subtract. 1e-2 /1e10 = 1e-12.

So 2/5 is 0.4, so 0.4e-12 → 4e-13.

So s² = 4e-13 → s = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, sqrt(4) is 2, sqrt(1e-13) is 1e-6.5, which is 3.16e-7.

Wait, 1e-13 is (1e-6.5)^2. So sqrt(4e-13) is sqrt(4)*sqrt(1e-13) = 2 * 1e-6.5.

Wait, 1e-6.5 is the same as 3.16e-7. So 2 * 3.16e-7 ≈ 6.32e-7.

So s is approximately 6.32e-7 M. So the concentration of Ca²+ is 6.32e-7 M. Looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M.

Wait, but let me double-check the setup. The Kf is given as 5e10, correct. The initial complex concentration is 0.02 M, right.

So the equation is Kf = [CaY²−]/([Ca²+][Y^4−]) → [Ca²+] = [Y^4−] because for each mole of complex that dissociates, you get one mole each of Ca²+ and Y^4−.

So yes, the setup is correct. So the answer should be C.

To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex (CaY²⁻) with a formation constant \( K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = 5 \times 10^{10} \), we analyze the dissociation equilibrium:

\[
\text{CaY}^{2-} \leftrightharpoons \text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{Y}^{4-}
\]

### Step 1: Expression for the formation constant
The equilibrium constant is given by:

\[
K_f = \frac{[\text{CaY}^{2-}]}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{Y}^{4-}]}
\]

Let the change in concentration of \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\) and \(\text{Y}^{4-}\) due to dissociation be \(s\). At equilibrium:
- \([\text{CaY}^{2-}] \approx 0.02 \, \text{M}\) (since dissociation is negligible due to the large \(K_f\)),
- \([\text{Ca}^{2+}] = s\),
- \([\text{Y}^{4-}] = s\).

Substituting into the \(K_f\) expression:

\[
K_f = \frac{0.02}{s^2}
\]

### Step 2: Solve for \(s\)
Rearranging for \(s^2\):

\[
s^2 = \frac{0.02}{K_f} = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
s = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} \approx 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, the concentration of \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\) is approximately \(6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}\).

### Step 3: Match with the options
The closest option is **C) \(6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}\)**.
