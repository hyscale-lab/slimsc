Alright, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. Okay, the question is about two quantum states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are given as 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. We need to find the energy difference that allows us to clearly distinguish between these two energy levels. The options are A to D.

Hmm, I remember something about the uncertainty principle in quantum mechanics. Oh right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. It states that there's a fundamental limit to the precision with which certain pairs of physical properties, like energy and time, can be known simultaneously. The formula I think is ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant.

Wait, but what's the exact relationship here? Oh right, the uncertainty in energy ΔE is inversely proportional to the uncertainty in time Δt. So, the longer the lifetime (Δt) of a state, the smaller the uncertainty in energy (ΔE), and vice versa. Wait, no, actually, the lifetime is the uncertainty in time. So, a shorter lifetime means a larger uncertainty in energy. So, if a state has a very short lifetime, its energy is less precisely determined because the uncertainty is larger.

The key here is that to distinguish two energy levels, the energy difference between them (ΔE) must be larger than the uncertainty in energy for each state. Otherwise, the two levels would be too close together, and we couldn't tell them apart.

So for each state, the uncertainty in energy is about ħ divided by the lifetime. Let me write that down. For E1, ΔE1 ≈ ħ / τ1, where τ1 is 1e-9 seconds. Similarly, for E2, ΔE2 ≈ ħ / τ2, which is 1e-8 seconds.

Wait, but wait. Since the question is about the energy difference between E1 and E2, perhaps we should take the maximum of the two uncertainties? Or maybe the sum? Hmm, not sure. I think the idea is that the energy difference between E1 and E2 should be larger than the uncertainty from either state. Otherwise, their energies would overlap in terms of uncertainty, making it impossible to resolve them.

So, the energy difference ΔE = |E2 - E1| needs to be greater than the maximum of the two uncertainties. Let's compute the uncertainties.

The reduced Planck's constant ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s. But since we're dealing with eV, another unit system might be easier. Oh wait, 1 eV is approximately 1.602e-19 J. So, let's convert ħ into eV·s.

Calculating ħ in eV·s: 1.0545718e-34 J·s * (1 eV / 1.602e-19 J) = approximately 6.582e-16 eV·s.

So, ħ ≈ 6.582e-16 eV·s.

Now, compute the uncertainties:

ΔE1 = ħ / τ1 = (6.582e-16 eV·s) / (1e-9 s) = 6.582e-7 eV.

Similarly, ΔE2 = ħ / τ2 = (6.582e-16 eV·s) / (1e-8 s) = 6.582e-8 eV.

Wait, wait. Let me double-check the math. 1e-9 s is 10^-9, so 6.582e-16 divided by 1e-9 is 6.582e-7. And 1e-8 is 0.1e-7, so 6.582e-16 / 1e-8 = 6.582e-8 eV.

So the uncertainties are about 6.58e-7 eV (E1) and 6.58e-8 eV (E2). Wait, but wait, no: E1 has a shorter lifetime (1e-9 s), so its uncertainty is larger, as expected. So the larger uncertainty is 6.58e-7 eV.

So for the energy difference to be clearly distinguished, ΔE must be greater than the maximum of these two uncertainties. So ΔE > 6.58e-7 eV? Or perhaps I'm mixing something up.

Wait, no. Another approach: the energy levels can be resolved (i.e., their spectral lines are distinguishable) if their energy separation is greater than the uncertainty in energy for the transitions. Hmm, maybe I should think about the natural linewidth or the lifetime broadening.

The natural linewidth is given by the uncertainty principle. The width Γ is approximately ħ/τ. So for E1, Γ1 = ħ/τ1 ≈ 6.58e-7 eV. Similarly, Γ2 = ħ/τ2 ≈ 6.58e-8 eV.

To resolve two lines, their separation must be greater than the sum of their half-widths, I think. Wait, the resolving power of a spectrometer or any measurement is such that the separation ΔE must be greater than the maximum of the two linewidths, but perhaps more accurately, the sum of their uncertainties. Or maybe it's the maximum of the two. Hmm, not entirely sure.

Wait, another thought: if each state has its own uncertainty in energy (Γ1 and Γ2), then the energy difference between E1 and E2 must be at least the sum of their uncertainties. Because if the separation is less than the sum, the peaks would overlap, and you couldn't distinguish them. So ΔE >= Γ1 + Γ2.

Wait, but let's compute Γ1 + Γ2. Γ1 is ~6.58e-7 eV, and Γ2 is ~6.58e-8 eV. So adding them gives about 7.24e-7 eV.

Wait, but looking at the options, the possible answers are 1e-9, 1e-11, 1e-4, 1e-8 eV. Hmm, none of these are around 1e-7 eV. So perhaps I'm approaching this wrong.

Wait, maybe the correct approach is to consider that the lifetime uncertainty is the time over which the energy is measured, and the energy difference must be larger than the uncertainty in energy for each state. So the energy difference should be greater than the maximum of the two uncertainties.

In that case, the maximum between 6.58e-7 eV and 6.58e-8 eV is 6.58e-7 eV. So the energy difference should be larger than this. So looking at the options, the only option above 6.58e-7 eV is option C, which is 1e-4 eV. Because 1e-4 is 0.0001 eV, which is much larger than 6.58e-7 (which is 0.000000658 eV).

Wait, but let me compute 1e-4 eV compared to the required ΔE. So 1e-4 is 1e4 times larger than 6.58e-7. So that would mean the energy difference is much larger than the uncertainty. Thus, option C would be sufficient.

Looking at the options:

A) 1e-9 eV → 0.001 times 1e-7 eV → much smaller than required. So not enough.

B) 1e-11 eV → way too small.

C) 1e-4 eV → much larger than 6.58e-7, so this would work.

D) 1e-8 eV → which is 0.1 * 6.58e-7 → just about 0.1 times the required value, so not enough.

Wait, but wait. Let's compute the numbers again. Γ1 is 6.58e-7 eV, Γ2 is 6.58e-8 eV. So the maximum is Γ1. So the energy difference should be greater than 6.58e-7 eV. So the only option that's larger than that is C (1e-4 eV), which is much larger. So C is acceptable.

But wait, could D be a possible option? D is 1e-8 eV, which is 0.001 * 6.58e-7 → nope, it's 1e-8 is 0.1 * 1e-7. Wait, 1e-8 is 0.1e-7, which is less than 6.58e-7. So 1e-8 eV is about (1e-8)/(6.58e-7) ≈ 0.015 times the maximum uncertainty. So that's way smaller than needed.

So the only option that's larger than the maximum uncertainty is C. Therefore, the correct answer is C.

Wait, but another approach: perhaps the energy difference must be resolved within the time of the shorter lifetime. Because if you have a shorter lifetime (E1), the uncertainty is larger. So to resolve E1 and E2, the energy difference must be larger than the uncertainty of E1, which is the larger uncertainty.

So the condition is ΔE > ħ / τ_min, where τ_min is the smaller lifetime. Because τ1 is 1e-9 s (smaller than τ2's 1e-8 s), so τ_min is 1e-9. Thus, ΔE must be larger than ħ / 1e-9 s = 6.58e-7 eV.

Thus, the energy difference must be greater than ~6.58e-7 eV. Looking at the options, again, only option C is larger than that. So, the answer is C.

To determine the energy difference required to clearly distinguish between two quantum states with energies \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \), we use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. The principle states that the uncertainty in energy (\( \Delta E \)) is inversely proportional to the uncertainty in time (\( \Delta t \)), given by:

\[
\Delta E \cdot \Delta t \approx \frac{\hbar}{2},
\]

where \( \hbar \) is the reduced Planck's constant. For a quantum state with lifetime \( \tau \), the uncertainty in energy is approximately:

\[
\Delta E \approx \frac{\hbar}{\tau}.
\]

### Step 1: Calculate the uncertainties for each state
The reduced Planck's constant in electron volts-seconds (\( \text{eV} \cdot \text{s} \)) is approximately:

\[
\hbar \approx 6.582 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{eV} \cdot \text{s}.
\]

For \( E_1 \) with \( \tau_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \):

\[
\Delta E_1 = \frac{\hbar}{\tau_1} = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-16}}{10^{-9}} \approx 6.582 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
\]

For \( E_2 \) with \( \tau_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \):

\[
\Delta E_2 = \frac{\hbar}{\tau_2} = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-16}}{10^{-8}} \approx 6.582 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}.
\]

### Step 2: Determine the required energy difference
To resolve the two energy levels, the energy difference \( \Delta E = |E_2 - E_1| \) must be greater than the maximum uncertainty between the two states. The maximum uncertainty is \( \Delta E_1 = 6.582 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Therefore, the energy difference must satisfy:

\[
\Delta E > 6.582 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
\]

### Step 3: Evaluate the options
- **Option A (\( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \))**: This is much smaller than \( 6.582 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it is insufficient.
- **Option B (\( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \))**: This is also much smaller than \( 6.582 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it is insufficient.
- **Option C (\( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \))**: This is much larger than \( 6.582 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it satisfies the condition.
- **Option D (\( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \))**: This is smaller than \( 6.582 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it is insufficient.

### Conclusion
The only energy difference that satisfies the condition is \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \).
