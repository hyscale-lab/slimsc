Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about two quantum states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are given as 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. We need to find the energy difference that allows us to clearly distinguish these two levels.

Hmm, I remember something about the uncertainty principle in quantum mechanics. Oh right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. It says that you can't precisely know both the energy and the lifetime of a particle simultaneously. The more precisely you know one, the less precisely you can know the other. The formula I think is ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant.

Wait, so if the energy levels are too close, their lifetimes would be longer, making it harder to distinguish them because the uncertainty in energy would be too big. Or is it the other way around? Let me think. The uncertainty in energy ΔE is inversely proportional to the uncertainty in time, which here is the lifetime Δt. So a shorter lifetime (like 1e-9 sec) would mean a larger uncertainty in energy. So to resolve two energy levels, their energy difference should be larger than the uncertainty, right?

So if the energy difference is much larger than the uncertainty, then we can clearly distinguish them. Let me look at the options. The options are different energy differences. I need to calculate the uncertainty in energy for each state and see which option is bigger than that.

Wait, but both states have different lifetimes. So each has a different Δt. Let me calculate the uncertainty for each.

The formula is ΔE ≈ ħ / (2Δt). Or wait, sometimes it's written as ΔE ≈ ħ / Δt, depending on the exact formulation. I think the precise version is ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2, so ΔE ≈ ħ/(2Δt). But maybe for this problem, the factor of 2 isn't important because the options are orders of magnitude different. So I can approximate ΔE ≈ ħ / Δt.

What's the value of ħ? I remember it's approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s. Oh, but the problem uses eV as the unit. I need to convert ħ into eV·s. Let me think. 1 eV is 1.602e-19 joules. So ħ in eV·s is 1.0545718e-34 J·s * (1 eV / 1.602e-19 J) ≈ approximately 6.582e-16 eV·s.

So ħ ≈ 6.582e-16 eV·s.

Now, for each state, calculate ΔE.

First, for the state with Δt = 1e-9 seconds:

ΔE1 ≈ ħ / Δt = 6.582e-16 eV·s / 1e-9 s = 6.582e-7 eV.

Wait, that's 6.582e-7 eV. So about 6.58e-7 eV.

The second state has Δt = 1e-8 seconds:

ΔE2 ≈ ħ / (1e-8 s) = 6.582e-16 /1e-8 = 6.582e-8 eV.

So now, the energy difference between E2 and E1 should be larger than both ΔE1 and ΔE2, right? Because both levels have their own uncertainties. Wait, no, maybe. Wait, the two states have different lifetimes, so each has their own uncertainty in energy. But when you're trying to resolve two energy levels, the energy difference needs to be larger than the sum of their uncertainties? Or perhaps the larger of the two?

Wait, perhaps more accurately, the energy difference must be larger than the uncertainty in energy of either state. Because if the energy difference is smaller than the uncertainty, you can't tell them apart.

Wait, no, maybe the uncertainty principle applies to each state individually. So for each state, the uncertainty in energy is about ħ/Δt. So if the energy difference between E2 and E1 is larger than the sum of their uncertainties, then they can be resolved. Or perhaps, the minimal condition is that the energy difference is larger than the uncertainty in either state, whichever is bigger.

Wait, let me rethink. Each state has a certain width in energy due to its lifetime. The energy levels are not infinitely sharp; they have a spread ΔE. So to distinguish two levels, the separation between them (ΔE_total) should be larger than the sum of their individual ΔEs. Because if the separation is less than the sum, the lines could overlap.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal condition is that the energy difference is larger than the uncertainty of the state with the smaller Δt. Because if the state with the longer lifetime (Δt=1e-8 s) has a smaller ΔE. Let me calculate.

ΔE1 ≈ 6.58e-7 eV (from Δt=1e-9 s), and ΔE2 ≈ 6.58e-8 eV (from Δt=1e-8 s). So the first state has a larger uncertainty, because a shorter lifetime (Δt) gives a larger ΔE.

Wait, no, wait. Let me recheck the calculation. For state 1, Δt=1e-9 s. So ΔE1 is 6.58e-16 / 1e-9 = 6.58e-7 eV. For state 2, Δt=1e-8 s, so ΔE2 is 6.58e-16 /1e-8 = 6.58e-8 eV. So yes, state 1 has a larger ΔE.

So the energy difference between E2 and E1 must be larger than the sum of their ΔEs or each's ΔE. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused here. Let's think about the energy levels as being smeared out into intervals. Each has an uncertainty ΔE. So to resolve two levels, the separation between them must be bigger than the sum of the uncertainties, because otherwise their energy intervals might overlap.

So, ΔE_total = |E2 - E1| must be greater than ΔE1 + ΔE2.

That makes sense because if the separation is larger than the sum, the lines don't overlap. So calculate ΔE_total = E2 - E1.

Compute the sum of the individual ΔEs: 6.58e-7 + 6.58e-8 = 7.24e-7 eV.

So the energy difference needs to be larger than about 7.24e-7 eV.

Wait, let's see the options:

A) 1e-9 eV → 0.001e-6 eV → way too small.

B) 1e-11 → even smaller.

C) 1e-4 eV → 0.0001 eV → which is 1e-4 eV → which is 1e-4 ≈ 0.0001 eV. Wait, that's much larger than 7.24e-7 eV (which is 7.24e-7 ≈ 0.000000724 eV). So 1e-4 is 0.0001, which is much larger than 0.000000724.

So option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 100 times larger than our required sum (since 7.24e-7 is about 0.000000724, and 1e-4 is 0.0001, which is about 138 times larger). So that's way larger. So that would satisfy the condition.

Wait, but the problem is phrased as "which one could be their energy difference so that they can be clearly resolved?" So any option where the energy difference is greater than the sum of the uncertainties would work. So looking at the options, only option C and perhaps D.

Wait, option D is 1e-8 eV. Let's compare that to our required 7.24e-7 eV. 1e-8 is 0.00000001 eV. 7.24e-7 is 0.000000724 eV. So option D is 0.00000001, which is smaller than 0.000000724. So that's not enough. So only option C is larger than the sum.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. Because some sources might say that the energy difference should be larger than the maximum of the two uncertainties. Or perhaps just larger than the individual uncertainties. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: the energy uncertainty for each state is delta E = hbar / (2 delta t). When you have two states, the lines will broaden, and the minimal separation to resolve them is when the separation is larger than the sum of the individual linewidths. So the energy difference must be larger than delta E1 + delta E2.

In this case, delta E1 is approximately 6.58e-7 eV, delta E2 is 6.58e-8 eV. So their sum is approximately 7.238e-7 eV, which is about 0.000000724 eV.

Looking at the options, option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 0.0001 eV. That's way larger than 0.000000724. So that's sufficient.

What about option D, 1e-8 eV? That's 0.00000001 eV, which is much smaller than 0.000000724. So option D is too small.

So the only option that is larger than the sum of the two uncertainties is option C.

Wait, but let me think again. Is the energy difference between E2 and E1 supposed to be greater than their individual uncertainties, or their sum?

Wait, another way: when two states have lifetimes delta t1 and delta t2, their energy uncertainties are delta E1 and delta E2. The minimal separation to resolve them is when delta E_total = E2 - E1 > delta E1 + delta E2. So yes, the sum.

So the energy difference must be greater than the sum of the two uncertainties. So in this case, sum is about 7.24e-7 eV. So the energy difference must be greater than that.

Looking at the options:

A) 1e-9 → 0.000000001 → too small.

B) 1e-11 → even smaller.

C) 1e-4 → 0.0001 → which is 0.0001 eV. That's 1e-4 eV = 0.0001 eV = 1e-4 eV.

Wait, 1e-4 eV is 0.0001 eV, which is 100 times larger than 1e-6 eV. Wait, our sum is 7.24e-7 eV = 0.000000724 eV. So 0.0001 is 100,000 times larger than 0.000000724. So it's way more than enough.

So the correct option is C.

To determine the energy difference required to clearly distinguish two quantum states with energies \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \), we use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, which states:

\[
\Delta E \cdot \Delta t \approx \frac{\hbar}{2},
\]

where \( \Delta E \) is the uncertainty in energy, \( \Delta t \) is the lifetime of the state, and \( \hbar \) is the reduced Planck's constant. Approximating \( \Delta E \approx \hbar / \Delta t \), we calculate the energy uncertainty for each state.

### Step 1: Calculate \( \Delta E \) for each state
- For the first state with \( \Delta t_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \):
  \[
  \Delta E_1 \approx \frac{\hbar}{\Delta t_1} = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{eV·s}}{10^{-9} \, \text{s}} = 6.582 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
  \]

- For the second state with \( \Delta t_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \):
  \[
  \Delta E_2 \approx \frac{\hbar}{\Delta t_2} = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{eV·s}}{10^{-8} \, \text{s}} = 6.582 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}.
  \]

### Step 2: Determine the required energy difference
To resolve two energy levels, the energy difference \( \Delta E_{\text{total}} = |E_2 - E_1| \) must be greater than the sum of the uncertainties of the two states:
\[
\Delta E_{\text{total}} > \Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2.
\]

Substituting the values:
\[
\Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2 = 6.582 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} + 6.582 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} = 7.238 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
\]

Thus, \( \Delta E_{\text{total}} \) must be greater than \( 7.238 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \).

### Step 3: Evaluate the options
- **Option A: \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} = 0.001 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{eV} \), which is much smaller than \( 7.238 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). This is too small.

- **Option B: \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} = 0.0001 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \), which is also much smaller than \( 7.238 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). This is too small.

- **Option C: \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} = 0.0001 \, \text{eV} \), which is \( 100,000 \times 7.238 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). This is much larger than the required energy difference. This is sufficient.

- **Option D: \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} = 0.00000001 \, \text{eV} \), which is smaller than \( 7.238 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). This is too small.

### Conclusion
The only option that satisfies the condition \( \Delta E_{\text{total}} > \Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2 \) is **Option C**.
