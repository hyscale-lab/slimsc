Okay, so I've got this question about organic chemistry, specifically about isomers and optical isomerism. Hmm, I remember that optical isomerism has something to do with chirality, where a compound has a non-superimposable mirror image. But let me think through each part carefully.

The question lists four compounds, and I need to determine which show optical isomerism. The options are A, B, C, D, each listing different combinations.

Let me go through each compound one by one.

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

Wait, biphenyl structures can sometimes have stereoisomerism because of the rotation around the central bond. But wait, biphenyls usually have restricted rotation, so if the substituents on each ring are in different positions, they might have cis or trans isomerism. Also, if the substituents are arranged in a way that creates a chiral center, then yes, optical isomerism is possible.

In this case, the substituents are at the 2 and 6 positions on each ring. So each ring has a COOCH3 group and a nitro group. Let me visualize the structure. Each benzene ring has two substituents: one at position 2 (the COOCH3) and another at position 6 (the nitro group). Because the two rings are connected at the 1 and 1' positions, perhaps the substituents on each ring are arranged such that each ring's substituents are on the same face (cis) or opposite (trans).

Wait, but does this create a chiral center? Or is it about the arrangement of substituents around the central bond leading to cis/trans isomerism? Oh, I think in biphenyls, if the substituents on each ring are in positions that allow for different arrangements (like one being on top and the other on the bottom), you can have stereoisomerism.

But wait, the question is about optical isomerism, which I think comes from the compound being chiral. So if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it won't be chiral. Let me think about the structure. The substituents are at 2 and 6 on each ring. So each ring has two substituents.

Wait, each ring has two substituents at positions 2 and 6. Wait, that's para to each other, right? So each substituent is across from the other. So on each ring, the COOCH3 and nitro are opposite each other.

But then, when connected to the biphenyl, the two rings have substituents in positions that might allow for different arrangements. Hmm, but would that create a chiral center? I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the biphenyl itself allows for enantiomerism if the substituents are arranged asymmetrically.

Wait, another thought. If the substituents on each ring are arranged such that the molecule has no plane of symmetry, then it can be chiral. Let's see: each ring has a COOCH3 and a nitro group. On each ring, these are opposite each other. So, when the rings are connected, each substituent is in a position that might lead to a chiral arrangement.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a center of inversion. If the substituents are arranged symmetrically, then no. But if they're not, then yes. Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should move on and come back.

2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

The formula for this would be CH3CO-O-CH2CH(OH)CH3? Wait, no, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Let's think: propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. Then the ester would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Wait, no, wait: the formula for methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would be CH3CH(OH)COOCH3? Because propanoate is CH2CH2COO-.

Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate would be HOCH2CH2COOCH3? No, wait. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. So the hydroxy is on the second carbon: so CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the structure is CH₂(OH)CH₂CO-OCH3.

Now, does this structure have a chiral center? Let's see. The carbons are:

Carbon 1: CH₂(OH)-

Carbon 2: CH₂-

Carbon 3: COOCH3.

Wait, no. Wait, the structure is CH₂(OH)CH₂COOCH3. So, the central carbon (the one attached to the OH) would be the second carbon. Let me number the carbons in the propionate part.

Wait, the ester is propanoate, so the chain is three carbons. The 2-hydroxy would be on the middle carbon. So the structure is:

CH₂(OH)CH₂COOCH3. So the middle carbon (CH₂) has the OH, a CH₂ group, a COOCH3, and a methyl group?

Wait, no. Let me draw it:

- The ester is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Propanoate is CH₂CH₂COO- where the ester is formed by replacing the hydroxyl with OMe.

So the structure is:

CH₂(OH)CH₂COOCH3.

Wait, no. Wait, propanoic acid is CH₂CH₂COOH. So 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH₂(OH)CH₂COOH. When esterified with methanol, the -OH of the acid becomes OMe. So it's CH₂(OH)CH₂COOCH3.

So the structure is:

CH₂(OH)-CH₂-COOCH3.

Looking at the central carbon (the one with the OH), which is attached to:

- OH,

- CH₂ (the next carbon),

- COOCH3,

- and another CH₂.

Wait, no. Wait, the central carbon is attached to:

- OH,

- a CH2 group (to the next carbon),

- a COOCH3 group,

- and a CH3 group? No, because in 2-hydroxypropanoate, the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3, which is:

Carbon 1: CH2(OH)

Carbon 2: CH2 (attached to carbon 1 and 3)

Carbon 3: COOCH3.

So the central carbon (carbon 2) is CH2. That's two CH2 groups, so it's CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the structure is: O

Wait, the central carbon is attached to:

- OH,

- two CH2 groups (from either side),

- and the COOCH3.

Wait, no, that's not a chiral center because it's attached to two identical groups (the two CH2 groups). So the central carbon is a CH2 group, which has two identical substituents (the two CH2 groups). Therefore, it doesn't have four different substituents, so no chiral center. Hmm, so no optical isomerism here?

Wait, but wait: Let me double-check. The structure is CH₂(OH)CH₂COOCH3. The central carbon is CH₂, so it's connected to:

- one OH,

- two CH₂ groups (left and right),

- and one COOCH3 group.

Wait, no. Because the central carbon is CH₂, so it's connected to two CH₂ groups on either side. So the substituents are: OH, CH₂CH₂COOCH3, two CH₂ groups. Wait no, the substituents would be: -OH, two CH2 groups (left and right?), and the COOCH3 group. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the central carbon is the one attached to the OH. Let's think: the structure is:

CH₂(OH) - CH₂ - COOCH3.

So the central carbon is the -CH₂- in the middle, which is attached to:

- The OH is on the first CH2,

- The central CH2 is connected to two CH2 groups (the first CH2 and the third, which is the COOCH3).

Wait, no, the central CH2 is between the OH and the COOCH3. So the central carbon is the second carbon (carbon 2) in the propanoate chain.

So the groups attached to carbon 2 are:

- One OH,

- Two CH2 groups (but wait, no, because carbon 2 is connected to carbon 1 (CH₂(OH)) and carbon 3 (COOCH3)), and two H's.

Wait, no, wait. Let me count. Carbon 1: CH₂(OH). Carbon 2: CH₂ (connected to carbon 1 and 3). Carbon 3: COOCH3.

Wait, no, perhaps I should write the structure as:

HOCH₂CH₂COOCH₃.

So the carbon chain is:

Carbon 1: CH₂(OH),

Carbon 2: CH₂,

Carbon 3: COOCH3.

So carbon 2 is CH₂ connected between carbon 1 and 3.

Wait, but then carbon 2 is attached to:

- The carbon 1 (CH₂(OH)),

- The carbon 3 (COOCH3),

- And two H's.

So, the substituents on carbon 2 are: two H's, a CH₂(OH), and a COOCH3. Therefore, carbon 2 is CH₂, which is not a chiral center because it only has two substituents (the CH₂(OH) and COOCH3), and two H's. So four substituents in total, but two are the same (H's). Therefore, no chiral center; thus, no optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait another thought. Maybe I'm looking at the wrong carbon. Let me think: 2-hydroxypropanoate would have the OH on carbon 2, which is the middle carbon. So the structure is:

CH₂(OH)CH₂COOCH3.

So the middle carbon (carbon 2) is CH₂. So it has two H's, a CH₂(OH), and a CH₂COOCH3. No, wait, the substituents would be:

- One OH (on carbon 1),

Wait no, I'm getting confused. Let me think of it as:

The molecule is:

CH₂(OH)-CH₂-CO-OCH3.

So the central carbon is CH₂, which has substituents: CH₂(OH), CH₂COOCH3, and two Hs. So, four substituents: two H's, CH₂(OH), and CH₂COOCH3. So two substituents are the same (the H's), so it's not a chiral center. Therefore, no optical isomerism here. So compound 2 does not show optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait again. Maybe I made a mistake. Let me think: 2-hydroxypropanoate would have the OH on the second carbon. So the structure is:

O

|
O-CO-OCH3

But wait, perhaps the structure is:

CH₂CH(OH)COOCH3.

Wait, no, because that would be 2-hydroxypropanoate. So the structure is:

CH₂(OH)CH₂COOCH3.

Wait, that would have the OH on the first carbon. No, wait: the numbering is such that the COOCH3 is on carbon 3, the middle on 2, and the first is 1.

Wait, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong. Let me think of propanoate as CH₂CH₂COO-. So 2-hydroxy would be on the middle carbon.

So it's CH₂(OH)CH₂COOCH3.

So the middle carbon is CH₂. It has two H's, so substituents are CH₂(OH), CH₂COOCH3, and two H's. So same as before, no chiral center.

Hmm, so compound 2 probably doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

3. Benzophenone.

Benzophenone is (Ph)₂CO. So two phenyl groups attached to a carbonyl group.

Now, does benzophenone have any chiral centers? No, because the carbonyl group is planar, and the two phenyl groups are identical. So the structure is symmetric. So even if the carbonyl group allows for some kind of stereoisomerism, since both phenyl groups are the same, there's no possibility for enantiomers.

Wait, benzophenone has a central carbon with two phenyl groups and a carbonyl. So it's Ph-CO-Ph.

The structure is symmetrical, so there's no chiral center. So no optical isomerism here.

4. Dimethyl fumarate.

Fumarate is the trans isomer of maleate. So dimethyl fumarate would be the diester where the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond.

Fumaric acid is (E)-butenedioic acid. So its structure is:

HOOC-CH₂CH₂-COOH (but wait, no, fumaric acid is the trans diastereomer of maleic acid. So the structure is:

HO₂C-CH=CH-CO₂H.

When esterified with methanol, it becomes:

CH₂=CH-CO-OCH3 and the other end COOCH3 as well? Wait, no. Dimethyl fumarate would be the diester where the two ester groups are on either end of the trans double bond.

So the structure is:

CH₂=CH-CO-OCH3 and the other end is OCH3 as well? Wait, no, it's diester, so both ends are ester groups.

So the structure is: CH₂=CH-CO-OCH3 and the other end is OCH3 as well, but wait, no. Wait, fumarate is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH in trans configuration. So the dimethyl ester would be CH₂=CH-CO-OCH3 and the other end is also a COOCH3.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The diacid is HO₂C-CH=CH-CO₂H. So the dimethyl ester would be MeO₂C-CH=CH-CO₂Me. So the two ester groups are on each end of the double bond.

Now, does this molecule have any double bond geometry that allows for cis and trans isomerism? Oh wait, the double bond is trans in fumarate, but the question is about optical isomerism, which is about chirality.

Wait, but in this case, the molecule has a double bond, but the substituents on each end are the same (two MeOOC groups on each end). So for each end, the substituents are the same, so any possibility of a chiral center?

Wait, no, because in dimethyl fumarate, the structure is:

MeOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOCH3 in the trans configuration? No, wait. Wait, fumarate is the trans isomer, which is E. So actually, the substituents on the double bond are on opposite sides.

Wait, but the molecule is symmetrical. Let's see: the two ester groups are on either end of a double bond, and the molecule is symmetric. So if you have the same groups on each end, can it have a plane of symmetry?

Yes, because it's a trans configuration, the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. But since the two ends are identical, there's a plane of symmetry down the center, so the molecule is not chiral. Therefore, no optical isomerism.

Wait, no, wait another thought. Alternatively, if the substituents were different, then maybe, but in this case, the substituents are the same.

Wait, but dimethyl fumarate has two ester groups on each end of a double bond. So the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3 on each end. So the molecule is symmetric, so it's not chiral. So no optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait, wait. Fumarate is the trans isomer. So, when esterified, it's dimethyl fumarate, which has a double bond in the trans configuration. But does that lead to any stereogenic centers or any possibility of enantiomers? No, because the molecule is symmetrical. So there's no chiral center.

Wait, but what about the possibility of geometric isomerism? Yes, but that's not optical isomerism. Optical isomerism relates to chirality, which is different from geometric isomerism.

So, to recap:

Looking at each compound for optical isomerism:

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

This is a biphenyl compound. If the substituents are arranged in such a way that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, then it would have enantiomers.

In this structure, each ring has a nitro group at 6 and a COOCH3 at 2. So on each ring, the substituents are at the 2 and 6 positions, which are para to each other.

But when connected via the biphenyl, the arrangement might lead to a chiral molecule.

Wait, the biphenyl structure can sometimes lead to cis and trans isomerism, but how about optical isomerism?

Wait, the biphenyl itself can have axial chirality if the substituents on each ring are arranged asymmetrically. So if the substituents on each ring are in positions that prevent the molecule from having a plane of symmetry.

In this case, each ring has a nitro and a COOCH3 group. Are these arranged in a way that creates a chiral center? Or is it about the arrangement around the central bond?

Wait, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry. Let me imagine: if each ring has substituents at 2 and 6, then the arrangement on each ring is symmetric. So when you have two rings, each with substituents in para positions, the entire molecule might be symmetrical, leading to no optical isomerism.

But wait, maybe the substituents are arranged in a way that the molecule is not symmetrical. For example, if the nitro group and COOCH3 are on the same face of the biphenyl, that might lead to a chiral structure.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think differently. If a molecule has a plane of symmetry, it’s not chiral. So, does this compound have a plane of symmetry?

Alternatively, perhaps each substituent on the biphenyl is arranged in a way that makes the molecule asymmetrical.

Wait, if each ring has a nitro and a COOCH3 group, and the two substituents are on the same side of the biphenyl, then the molecule might not have a plane of symmetry, making it chiral.

Alternatively, if the substituents are on opposite sides, then perhaps the molecule is symmetrical.

But how can I determine that from the name?

The name is dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

So, the substituents on each ring are at 2 and 6 positions relative to the connecting bond (the 1 and 1' positions). So on each ring:

- Position 2: COOCH3,

- Position 6: nitro,

and on the other ring, same.

So in each ring, the substituents are para to each other. When connected, the two substituents on each ring (COOCH3 and nitro) are across the ring.

But the way they're arranged around the biphenyl would determine if the molecule is chiral.

Wait, perhaps the substituents on each ring are on the same face or opposite faces of the biphenyl. If they're on the same face, then the molecule might not have a plane of symmetry, leading to optical isomerism.

Alternatively, if they are on opposite faces, the molecule might be symmetrical.

But given the name, I think the substituents are arranged in such a way that the molecule is not symmetrical, leading to a chiral center and thus optical isomerism.

Wait, but biphenyls usually have restricted rotation, so maybe the substituents can arrange in a way that leads to axial chirality.

Axial chirality refers to the chirality arising from the arrangement of substituents around an axis, like in biphenyls. So if the substituents on each ring are arranged in a way that creates a non-superimposable mirror image, then the molecule is chiral.

In this case, each ring has a nitro and a COOCH3 group in the 2 and 6 positions. When connected via the biphenyl, the arrangement could lead to the substituents being on the same face or opposite faces, leading to cis or trans isomerism.

Wait, but axial chirality is possible only if the two substituents on each ring are on opposite faces, leading to a non-superimposable mirror image.

So, if in this compound, the substituents on each ring are arranged in such a way that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, then it's chiral and exhibits optical isomerism.

But I'm not entirely confident about this. Maybe I should look for other possibilities.

Alternatively, perhaps compound 4 is the one that shows optical isomerism. Wait, no, earlier I thought 4 doesn't show it.

Wait, let's go back. Compound 4 is dimethyl fumarate. I thought it doesn't have any chiral centers, but wait, maybe I was wrong.

Wait, dimethyl fumarate is the trans isomer of dimethyl maleate. The structure is MeOOC-CH₂CH₂-COOCH3? No, wait, fumarate is trans, so the structure is MeOOC-CH=CH-COOCH3, with the ester groups on opposite sides of the double bond.

Wait, is there a possibility of a chiral center in this molecule? No, because each end is symmetric. The molecule is symmetric across the double bond, so it's not chiral. So, no optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait again. If the double bond is in the middle and the substituents on each end are the same, then the molecule is not chiral. So, no.

So, looking back, which compounds have optical isomerism.

1. I'm not sure yet.

2. I think no.

3. No.

4. No.

So, then, let me think again about compound 1. If the substituents on each ring are arranged in a way that the molecule is not symmetrical, then it would have optical isomerism.

Alternatively, perhaps in the given name, the substituents are arranged in a trans fashion, leading to a symmetric structure. Or maybe in a cis arrangement, leading to asymmetry.

Wait, the name is dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

The substituents on each ring are at 2 and 6, which are para. So each ring has the nitro and COOCH3 groups para to each other.

So the arrangement would be such that on each ring, nitro and COOCH3 are across from each other.

But when connected to the biphenyl, perhaps the substituents are on the same face or opposite faces.

Wait, but regardless, the key point is whether the molecule is chiral. If the molecule has a plane of symmetry or not.

Another approach: if the molecule has a center of symmetry, it's not chiral. So, imagine the biphenyl with substituents arranged so that each substituent on one ring has a mirror image on the other ring.

Wait, but in this case, each ring has the same substituents. So perhaps the molecule is symmetrical, leading to no optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait. If the substituents on each ring are in positions that are mirror images, then the whole molecule would have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral.

For example, if the COOCH3 is on the same face of the biphenyl as the nitro group on the other ring, then the molecule would have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. But if not, it's chiral.

So, the key is whether the substituents are arranged in a way that creates a plane of symmetry or not.

But without knowing the exact structure, it's a bit tricky. However, the name gives some indication. The substituents are at 2 and 6 on each ring, which are para to each other. So, perhaps the molecule is symmetrical, leading to no optical isomerism.

If that's the case, then none of the four compounds would show optical isomerism, but that's not one of the options.

Wait, the options are:

A) 1,2,4 show.

B)3,4.

C)2,3.

D)1,2.

Hmm, given that, perhaps I'm missing something.

Let me think again about compound 4: dimethyl fumarate. If the ester groups are on the same side of the double bond, would that create a chiral center? No, because the molecule would have a plane of symmetry. But in fumarate, they are on opposite sides.

Wait, no, in the trans configuration, the substituents are on opposite sides, but since they're the same (two COOCH3 groups), the molecule is symmetric. So it's not chiral.

Wait, but what about if the substituents were different? Then, the molecule would be chiral. But in fumarate, they're same, so no.

So, back to compound 1.

Wait, maybe I was wrong earlier. Let's imagine the substituents on each ring are arranged in a way that makes the entire molecule asymmetric.

Each ring has a nitro and a COOCH3 group. If the arrangement leads to a chiral center, then yes. But biphenyls don't have chiral centers; axial chirality is a different concept.

Axial chirality arises when the two substituents on either end of a single bond are on the same or opposite faces, leading to non-superimposable mirror images.

In biphenyls, the rotation around the central bond is restricted, leading to cis and trans isomerism. But for axial chirality, the substituents must not be mirror images.

So, in this compound, each ring has a nitro and a COOCH3 group. If the substituents are arranged such that they are on the same face, then the molecule would have axial chirality and exhibit optical isomerism.

So, if the two COOCH3 groups are on the same face, and the two nitro groups are on the same face, the molecule would have axial chirality.

But given the way the substituents are arranged in the name, I'm not sure. The name is dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

The substituents are on the same positions on each ring, but their arrangement around the central bond could be either cis or trans, leading to cis or trans isomerism. But axial chirality would require that the substituents are arranged in a way that there's no plane of symmetry.

Wait, perhaps the molecule has two identical substituents on each ring, making the molecule symmetric. So, no axial chirality, hence no optical isomerism.

Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing. Let me try a different approach. Which of these compounds are known to exhibit optical isomerism?

I think dimethyl fumarate (compound 4) is the trans isomer and is not chiral because the molecule is symmetrical. Benzophenone (compound 3) is definitely not chiral.

Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (compound 2) I'm now thinking might have a chiral center. Wait, maybe I was wrong earlier. Let me re-examine that.

Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: structure is O

O
||
O-C-OCH3 attached to CH₂CH(OH)CH3?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in determining the chiral center. Let me write the structure again.

The correct IUPAC name is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Propanoate is CH₂CH₂COO-.

So, 2-hydroxypropanoate would be HO-CH₂CH₂COO-.

Esterified with methyl, it becomes HO-CH₂CH₂-COO-OCH3.

Wait, no. The structure should be:

The hydroxy is on the second carbon of the propanoate. So, the propanoate is:

O
|
O-CO-OCH3 attached to CH₂CH(OH)CH3?

Wait, no, propanoate is three carbons. So, the chain is:

O=C-OCH3

attached to CH₂CH(OH)CH3?

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

CH₂(OH)CH₂COOCH3.

So, the second carbon (CH₂) is attached to:

- One OH,

- One CH₂ (connected to the first carbon),

- One COOCH3,

- And one H.

Wait, no, the second carbon is CH₂, so it's attached to two CH₂ groups, an OH, and a COOCH3.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think about the actual structure.

The ester is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Propanoic acid is CH₂CH₂COOH. Replacing the -OH with OMe gives CH₂CH₂COOCH3.

But 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH₂(OH)CH₂COOH. So the ester would be CH₂(OH)CH₂COOCH3.

So the structure is:

CH₂(OH)-CH₂-COOCH3.

Now, the middle carbon (CH₂) is attached to:

- One OH,

- One CH₂ (from the first carbon),

- One COOCH3,

- And one H.

Wait, no, the middle carbon has four substituents: two CH₂ groups (on either side), an OH, and a COOCH3. Wait, no, no, because the middle carbon is connected to:

- Carbon 1: CH₂(OH),

- Carbon 3: COOCH3,

- And two H's.

So substituents are: OH (on carbon 1?), no, the substituent on the middle carbon is:

Wait, I'm getting myself confused. Let me visualize the molecule.

The molecule is:

CH₂(OH)-CH₂-COOCH3.

So, the middle carbon is the second carbon (CH₂). The four substituents on this carbon are:

- One OH on the first carbon (no, wait, that's not on the same carbon),

Wait, no. The substituents on the second carbon are:

- One CH₂(OH),

- One CH₂ (connected to COOCH3),

- And two H's.

Wait, no, each carbon is connected to four substituents.

Wait, the second carbon is CH₂, which is connected to:

- Carbon 1: CH₂(OH),

- Carbon 3: COOCH3,

- And two H's.

So, substituents are: two H's, a CH₂(OH), and a COOCH3 group.

So, the substituents on the second carbon are:

- Two H's,

- CH₂(OH),

- COOCH3.

So, this carbon has two identical substituents (H's) and two different ones (CH₂(OH) and COOCH3). Therefore, it's a chiral center, because all four substituents are different.

Wait, no. Wait, the substituents are:

- Two H's,

- CH₂(OH),

- COOCH3.

So, two substituents are the same (H's). Therefore, the carbon is not a chiral center because it doesn't have four different groups. Therefore, no optical isomerism in compound 2.

Wait, but I'm getting conflicting thoughts. Let me think: a chiral center requires four different substituents.

So, the substituents are:

- H,

- H,

- CH₂(OH),

- COOCH3.

So, two substituents are the same (H's). Therefore, no chiral center.

So, compound 2 doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Hmm.

So, back to compound 1.

I think that in compound 1, each ring has a nitro and a COOCH3 group. The substituents are arranged in such a way that the molecule has no plane of symmetry, leading to axial chirality.

So, if each ring's substituents are on the same face, then the molecule is chiral and has optical isomerism. Alternatively, if on opposite faces, it's not chiral.

But how can I tell from the name?

The name is dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

The substituents are at 2 and 6 on each ring. The 1,1' bond connects the two rings.

In such a structure, the nitro and COOCH3 groups on each ring are across from each other (para), but their arrangement around the central bond could be cis or trans.

Wait, but whether they're cis or trans determines if the molecule is chiral.

Wait, if the substituents on each ring are in the same relative positions, then the molecule may have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. But if their arrangement leads to no plane of symmetry, then it's chiral.

So, suppose on each ring, the COOCH3 is at position 2, which is ortho to the connecting bond (1), and the nitro is at position 6, which is para to the COOCH3.

When connected to the other ring, if the COOCH3 groups are on the same face, the molecule would have a plane of symmetry. Wait, no—if both COOCH3 are on the same face, then the molecule might have a center of symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is symmetric in such a way that it's not chiral.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are arranged such that the molecule is symmetrical, making it not chiral.

But I'm not confident. Given that, perhaps the correct answer is that compound 4 doesn't show optical isomerism, and only compound 1 and 2 do. Or not.

Wait, another approach: which of these compounds are known to have stereoisomerism.

Fumarate (compound 4) is a trans diastereomer of maleate, but that's about geometric isomerism, not optical.

Benzophenone (3) is symmetric, so no optical isomerism.

Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-biphenyl (1) — perhaps it's a case of diastereomerism due to axial chirality, leading to optical isomerism.

As for methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (2), earlier conclusion was no, but perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, maybe I was wrong about compound 2. Let me think again.

Structure: CH₂(OH)-CH₂-COOCH3.

So, the middle carbon is CH₂, with substituents: two H's, CH₂(OH), and COOCH3.

Wait, but that’s four substituents: two H’s, a CH₂(OH), and a COOCH3.

Wait, no, each CH₂ group has two H's attached. So, substituents on the middle carbon are:

- Two H's,

- CH₂(OH) group,

- COOCH3 group.

So, substituents are: H, H, CH₂(OH), COOCH3.

Therefore, two substituents are the same, so no chiral center. Hence, no optical isomerism.

So, perhaps the only compound that shows optical isomerism is compound 1.

But the options don't have an option with only 1. Let's look at the options again.

Options:

A) 1,2,4

B)3,4

C)2,3

D)1,2.

So, none of the options have only 1. So perhaps I'm wrong about compound 1.

Alternative possibility: perhaps in compound 1, the substituents are such that the molecule is symmetric, leading to no optical isomerism. Then, only another compound shows it.

Wait, but earlier I concluded that compound 2 doesn't have optical isomerism.

So perhaps the correct answer is that none of the compounds show optical isomerism, but that's not an option.

Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think.

Another way to approach: looking for the presence of a chiral center or axial chirality.

Compound 1: if the substituents on the biphenyl are arranged in a way that creates a chiral axis, leading to axial chirality, then it would have optical isomerism.

Molecules with axial chirality are chiral and exhibit optical isomerism. For example, in biphenyls, if the substituents on each ring are on the same face, the molecule is chiral.

So, if each ring has substituents that are not mirror images, the molecule would be chiral.

In compound 1, each ring has a nitro and a COOCH3 group. If the arrangement is such that nitro and COOCH3 on each ring are on the same face, then the molecule would be chiral.

But wait, the substituents on each ring are at 2 and 6 positions, which are para. So, when connected to the biphenyl, if the substituents on the same ring are on the same face, perhaps the entire molecule is chiral.

Hmm, but I'm not entirely certain.

Alternatively, perhaps this structure is symmetrical, leading to no optical isomerism.

Hmm, this is getting too confusing. Maybe I should make an educated guess based on the options.

Given the options, only option A includes 1,2,4. But I thought 2 and 4 don't show it. So perhaps the correct answer is A) 1,2,4, but I'm not confident.

Wait, another thought: dimethyl fumarate (4) is the trans isomer, which is a geometric isomer but not chiral. So it doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (2) doesn't have a chiral center, so no optical isomerism.

Benzophenone (3) doesn't.

So the only compound left is 1, which I think might have optical isomerism.

But the options don't have a choice for only 1. So perhaps I made a mistake in considering another compound.

Wait, compound 4: dimethyl fumarate. Its structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3

on each end of a double bond between two CH groups.

Wait, the structure is CH₂=CH-CO-OCH3 on each end. Wait, no, the correct structure is:

MeOOC-CH=CH-COOCH3.

In this structure, each end has a MeOOC group attached to a CH group, connected by a double bond (CH=CH).

If the molecule is symmetric, then it's not chiral.

Wait, but wait. If the groups on each end are the same, then the molecule is symmetric and not chiral.

Yes, so no optical isomerism.

So, back to the original question. Which compounds show optical isomerism?

Only compound 1 might, but none of the options have only 1.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake about compound 2. Let me think again.

Structure of compound 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

The structure is CH₂(OH)-CH₂-COOCH3.

So, the middle carbon is CH₂, which has:

- Two H's,

- CH₂(OH),

- COOCH3.

But wait, the substituents are:

- One OH (on the first carbon),

Wait no, the substituents on the middle carbon are:

- One CH₂(OH),

- One CH₂ (connected to COOCH3),

- Two H's.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused between the substituents on the same carbon and neighboring carbons.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

CH₂(OH)CH₂COOCH3.

Which would make the middle carbon (CH₂) attached to:

- Two CH₂ groups (the ones on either side),

- One OH group (on the first CH₂),

- One COOCH3 group (on the third carbon).

Wait, but that's not possible. Each carbon can only have four bonds.

I think I'm getting stuck, so I'll proceed to the conclusion based on my analysis.

So, from the four compounds:

1. Maybe has optical isomerism.

2. No.

3. No.

4. No.

But options don't have only 1.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option A) 1,2,4, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, maybe I'm wrong about compound 1.

Another approach: perhaps compound 4 (dimethyl fumarate) is the only one showing optical isomerism.

Wait, no, because fumarate is not chiral. So, perhaps no.

Hmm, this is taking too long. I'll have to make a decision.

Based on the analysis, only compound 1 might have optical isomerism, but the given options don't have an option for just 1. So perhaps the correct answer is A) 1,2,4, but I'm not confident.

Wait, perhaps I was wrong about compound 2. Let me think: if the central carbon is CH₂, but maybe that's a chiral center.

Wait, if the substituents are:

- Two CH₂ groups (left and right),

- One OH,

- One COOCH3.

Wait, no, because the substituents would be:

- Two H's,

- CH₂(OH),

- CH₂COOCH3,

So, the substituents are two H's, a CH₂(OH), and a CH₂COOCH3. Two substituents are same (H's), so no chiral center.

Thus, I think none of the options are correct, but since I must choose, perhaps the correct answer is A) 1,2,4.

Wait, but I don't think 2 and 4 show it. So I'm stuck.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Another perspective: the correct answer is A) 1,2,4.

But I think the correct answer is A) 1,2,4, based on considering that compound 1 has axial chirality, compound 2 has a chiral center, and compound 4 has a chiral center. Wait, no, I thought 4 doesn't. Hmm.

I think I'll have to make an educated guess. Based on the analysis, the correct answer is A) 1,2,4, but I'm not entirely confident.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine which compounds exhibit optical isomerism, we analyze each compound for the presence of chirality, which requires a molecule to lack a plane of symmetry and have a chiral center or axial chirality.

### Analysis of Each Compound:

1. **Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**  
   This compound is a biphenyl structure with substituents at the 2 and 6 positions on each ring. The arrangement of the nitro and carboxylate groups on each ring can lead to axial chirality if the substituents are not arranged symmetrically around the central bond. This lack of symmetry would result in non-superimposable mirror images, making the molecule chiral and capable of exhibiting optical isomerism.

2. **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**  
   The structure of this compound is CH₃CH(OH)COOCH₃. The middle carbon (C2) is attached to two identical groups (two CH₂ groups), an OH group, and a COOCH₃ group. Since two substituents are identical, this carbon is not a chiral center. Therefore, the molecule does not exhibit optical isomerism.

3. **Benzophenone**  
   Benzophenone has the structure (Ph)₂CO, where two identical phenyl groups are attached to a carbonyl group. The molecule is symmetrical, with a plane of symmetry bisecting the carbonyl group. As a result, it is not chiral and does not exhibit optical isomerism.

4. **Dimethyl Fumarate**  
   Dimethyl fumarate is the trans isomer of dimethyl maleate, with the structure CH₂=CH-CO-OCH₃. The molecule is symmetrical across the double bond, as both ends are identical. This symmetry prevents the molecule from being chiral, and thus it does not exhibit optical isomerism.

### Conclusion:
- Compound 1 exhibits optical isomerism due to axial chirality.  
- Compounds 2, 3, and 4 do not exhibit optical isomerism.  

From the given options, the correct answer is **A) 1, 2, and 4**, as compound 1 is the only compound that exhibits optical isomerism, but the options provided do not allow for selecting only compound 1. Based on the analysis, the most reasonable choice is **A**.
