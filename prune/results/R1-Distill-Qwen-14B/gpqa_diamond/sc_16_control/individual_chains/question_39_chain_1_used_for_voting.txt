Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about wave functions and particles in a tube. Hmm, let me try to figure this out. I'm a bit rusty on quantum mechanics, but let's think it through.

So the problem says we have 10,000 identical systems, each with a particle that's under the same conditions. Each particle moves along a tube, which is the x-axis. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Oh wait, and i is the imaginary unit, right, sqrt(-1). 

When they measure the position of the particles, none were found at x less than 1 or x greater than 3. So the particles are only found between x=1 and x=3. That probably means that the wave function is zero outside this region, but wait, the given wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i. Hmm, that seems a bit complex.

Wait, maybe the wave function is given in a part of space where x is between 1 and 3. Or perhaps the wave function is non-zero only there. I remember that the wave function's square modulus gives the probability density. So the total probability of finding the particle in a region is the integral of |ψ(x)|² dx from 1 to 3, which should equal 1 because all the particles are found there.

Let me write down the wave function: ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Wait, but that seems a bit odd. Because typically, the wave function is a complex function, but in this case, it's expressed as a sum of a real term and an imaginary term. Alternatively, maybe it's written as a real part minus an imaginary part. Or perhaps it's a typo and should be (a / sqrt(1+x)) multiplied by e^(-i something), but I'm not sure.

Wait, wait. Let me think. The wave function must be normalized, meaning the integral of |ψ(x)|² dx over all space is 1. But in this case, the particles are only found between x=1 and x=3, so the integral of |ψ(x)|² from 1 to 3 should be 1. 

So, let's compute |ψ(x)|². The wave function is (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So the complex conjugate would be (a / sqrt(1+x)) + 0.5i. Multiplying them together: 

[ (a / sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i ] * [ (a / sqrt(1+x)) +0.5i ] = (a²)/(1+x) + (0.5i * a / sqrt(1+x)) - (0.5i * a / sqrt(1+x)) + (0.5i)*(0.5i). 

Wait, the cross terms (the ones with i) would cancel out because they're opposite in sign. So what's left is (a²)/(1+x) + (0.5i)^2. Now, 0.5i squared is (0.25)(i^2) = 0.25 * (-1) = -0.25. So the modulus squared becomes (a²)/(1+x) - 0.25.

Wait, that can't be right because the modulus squared should be a positive real number since it's a probability density. So if I end up with (a²)/(1+x) - 0.25, that could be negative, which doesn't make sense. Oh, so maybe I made a mistake in calculating.

Let me do this again. The modulus squared is |ψ|² = ψ*(x) * ψ(x). So ψ(x) is (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. ψ*(x) is (a / sqrt(1+x)) + 0.5i. Multiply:

(a/sqrt(1+x))^2 + (a/sqrt(1+x))(0.5i) - (0.5i)(a/sqrt(1+x)) - (0.5i)^2.

Wait, no, better to write it as:

(a²)/(1+x) + (a * 0.5i)/sqrt(1+x) - (0.5i * a)/sqrt(1+x) + (0.5i)(0.5i).

Wait, the second and third terms cancel each other because they are a *0.5i/sqrt(1+x) and -a *0.5i/sqrt(1+x). So they add up to zero. The last term is (0.5i)^2 = 0.25 * (-1) = -0.25.

So the modulus squared becomes (a²)/(1+x) - 0.25. Hmm, but that's a problem because if (a²)/(1+x) is less than 0.25, then the modulus squared is negative, which isn't possible. So perhaps my initial assumption is wrong about the wave function.

Wait, another thought. Maybe the wave function is written differently. Perhaps it's ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) * e^{-i something}, but in the problem, it's given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Alternatively, maybe the wave function is a real function multiplied by something else. 

Alternatively, perhaps the wave function is given as a real function plus an imaginary constant term. But that would complicate the modulus squared. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating things.

Let me think again. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. That's a complex function. So its modulus squared would be the sum of the squares of the real and imaginary parts. Because ψ = A + Bi, then |ψ|² = A² + B².

So in this case, the real part is (a / sqrt(1+x)) and the imaginary part is (-0.5). So the modulus squared is [a²/(1+x)] + (0.5)^2. Because (-0.5i) is the imaginary part, so B is -0.5, but B squared is 0.25.

Wait, that makes more sense. I think I messed up the calculation earlier. So |ψ(x)|² = [a²/(1 + x)] + (0.5)^2. So that's [a²/(1+x)] + 0.25.

So the probability density is [a²/(1+x)] + 0.25. Now, the integral of |ψ|² dx from 1 to 3 must be 1, since all the probability is there.

So, the normalization condition is:

∫ (from x=1 to x=3) [ (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx = 1.

Let me compute this integral. Let's split it into two parts: the a² term and the 0.25 term.

Integral of a²/(1+x) dx from 1 to 3: a² * ln(1+x) evaluated between 1 and 3.

So that's a² [ ln(4) - ln(2) ) ] = a² ln(2).

Wait, because 1+x from 1 to 3: 2 to 4, so ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(4/2) = ln(2).

The second part is the integral of 0.25 dx from 1 to 3: 0.25*(3-1) = 0.25 * 2 = 0.5.

So adding both parts:

a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So, a² ln(2) = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5.

So a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

Wait, what's the value of ln(2)? Approximately 0.6931.

So a² = 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7202.

So a = sqrt(0.7202) ≈ 0.8485.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.85, which is close. So the answer should be B.

Wait, but let me make sure I did everything correctly.

Another point: Do I need to consider the normalization of the wave function elsewhere? The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i. Wait, but the modulus squared is [a²/(1+x)] + 0.25, right?

Alternatively, perhaps the wave function is written as (a / sqrt(1+x)) multiplied by e^{-i something}, but the given form isn't like that. Hmm, but the way I calculated |ψ|² as the sum of squares of real and imaginary parts seems correct. Because for a complex number A + Bi, |A + Bi|² = A² + B².

So, I think my approach is correct. So a is approximately 0.8485, which rounds to 0.85, option B.

The problem involves determining the value of "a" in the wave function of a particle confined between \(x = 1\) and \(x = 3\). The wave function is given as:

\[
\psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1 + x}} - 0.5i
\]

The wave function must be normalized, meaning the integral of the probability density \(|\psi(x)|^2\) over the interval \(x = 1\) to \(x = 3\) must equal 1. The probability density is calculated as:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1 + x}}\right)^2 + (-0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1 + x} + 0.25
\]

The normalization condition is:

\[
\int_1^3 \left(\frac{a^2}{1 + x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1
\]

This integral is split into two parts:

1. **First term (\(a^2 / (1 + x)\)):**
   \[
   \int_1^3 \frac{a^2}{1 + x} dx = a^2 \ln(1 + x) \Big|_1^3 = a^2 \left[\ln(4) - \ln(2)\right] = a^2 \ln(2)
   \]

2. **Second term (\(0.25\)):**
   \[
   \int_1^3 0.25 dx = 0.25 \cdot (3 - 1) = 0.5
   \]

Adding these results, the normalization equation becomes:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1
\]

Solving for \(a^2\):

\[
a^2 \ln(2) = 0.5 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}
\]

Using \(\ln(2) \approx 0.6931\):

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7202 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a \approx \sqrt{0.7202} \approx 0.8485
\]

Rounding to two decimal places, \(a \approx 0.85\). Comparing this result with the options provided, the closest match is:

**Option B: 0.85**

Answer: B
