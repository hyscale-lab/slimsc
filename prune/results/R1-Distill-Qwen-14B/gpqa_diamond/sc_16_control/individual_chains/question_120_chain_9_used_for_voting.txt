Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about stars' distribution in the sky and how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Wait, the parallax of a star is inversely proportional to its distance from us. So, a larger parallax means the star is closer, and smaller parallax means it's farther away.

The question says stars are uniformly distributed, which I think means that their actual spatial density is the same throughout space. So, if you consider a volume of space, there are the same number of stars in each volume, regardless of where you look. But wait, how does that translate to the number of stars we observe with a certain range of parallax?

Parallax (plx) is measured in arcseconds, right? And the formula for distance using parallax is something like distance (in parsecs) = 1 / plx. So, if a star has a parallax of 1 arcsecond, it's 1 parsec away. If the parallax is 0.5, it's 2 parsecs away, and so on.

Now, the question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. So, if I look at a range from plx to plx + dplx, how many stars are there in that range?

Let me think about the volume of space between distances corresponding to plx and plx + dplx. Since distance is 1/plx, an increase in plx (like going from plx to plx + dplx) corresponds to a decrease in distance. Wait, no, higher plx means closer distance. So, as plx increases, the distance decreases. So, when plx is small, like 0.1, the star is 10 parsecs away. If plx is 0.2, it's 5 parsecs away.

If I imagine a spherical shell around the Earth, the volume between two distances (d and d + dd) would be the volume of that thin shell. The volume of a sphere is (4/3)πr³, so the volume of the shell (dd thick) would be approximately 4πr² dr. Because dr is small compared to r, higher-order terms can be neglected.

So for stars in a thin shell at distance d, the volume is 4πd² dd. If the number density of stars is n (number per cubic parsec, say), then the number of stars in that shell would be n * 4πd² dd.

But how does this relate to parallax? Since d = 1/plx, then d = 1/plx → plx = 1/d.

So, let's express everything in terms of plx. Let's say plx increases by dplx. The corresponding change in d would be dd = - (d²) dplx. Wait, because plx is inversely proportional to d, so d = 1/plx → dd = - (1/plx²) dplx.

But wait, when plx increases by dplx, d decreases by dd. So, the thickness in distance terms is dd = - (1/plx²) dplx. But since we're dealing with absolute numbers, the negative just indicates direction, which we can ignore for volume purposes.

So, the volume of the shell in terms of plx is 4π (d)^2 dd. Substituting d = 1/plx and dd = (1/plx²) dplx (taking absolute value), the volume becomes 4π (1/plx)^2 * (1/plx²) dplx. Wait, that seems off. Let me think again.

Wait, wait. I think I made a mistake there. Let me re-derive it. The volume element in terms of distance is 4π d² dd. But since d = 1/plx, let's express d in terms of plx.

So, d = 1/plx. Therefore, the volume element dV = 4π (1/plx)^2 * (dd), but what is dd in terms of dplx?

From d = 1/plx, taking derivative both sides: dd = - (1/(plx²)) dplx.

So, the volume element dV = 4π (1/plx)^2 * ( - (1/plx²) dplx ), but since we're considering small increments, the negative sign just indicates direction, so we can take the absolute value.

Thus, dV = 4π (1/plx²) * (1/plx²) dplx. Wait, wait, that's 4π (1/plx^4) dplx. No, that doesn't seem right. Wait, wait, let me re-express this correctly.

Wait, dV = 4π d² dd. And dd = -(1/plx²) dplx. So, dV = 4π (1/plx)^2 * (1/plx²) dplx. Wait, that would be 4π (1/plx^4) dplx. Hmm, but that seems like a very steep decrease.

But wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The number of stars in a volume is proportional to the volume. So, n (number per volume) times the volume is the number of stars.

So, if the number density is uniform (n is constant), then the number of stars in a thin shell at distance d with thickness dr is N = n * 4π d² dr.

But since we want it in terms of parallax plx, and plx = 1/d, let me express everything in terms of plx.

dr = derivative of r with respect to plx. Since r = 1/plx, dr = -1/(plx)^2 dplx.

So, dr = - (1/plx²) dplx. But since we're considering a small increase in plx, the change in r is negative. But for the thickness, we take the absolute value, so dr = (1/plx²) dplx.

Wait, no. The shell's thickness is dr, which is the change in distance. But since plx is increasing, distance is decreasing. So, if plx increases by dplx, the distance decreases by dr = (1/plx²) dplx.

So, the volume of the shell is 4π (r)^2 dr = 4π (1/plx)^2 * (dplx / plx²) ).

Wait, that gives 4π (1/plx^2) * (dplx / plx²) )= 4π (dplx) / plx^4.

So, the number of stars in that shell is n * (4π dplx / plx^4 ), where n is the number density.

But wait, number density (n) is stars per unit volume. So, the number of stars per unit parallax (dplx) is (n * 4π) * (dplx / plx^4).

But the question is about the number of stars per unit range of plx, which is the number per dplx. So, that's proportional to 1/plx^4.

Wait, but the options are about how it changes with plx. If the number per unit plx is proportional to 1/plx^4, that would be option A.

But wait, I thought the answer was something else. Let me double-check.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have considered the differential in terms of plx. The number of stars in a thin shell at plx is proportional to the volume of the shell, which we found is proportional to (1/plx^4) dplx.

Wait, but wait, if the number of stars is N = n * dV, then dV = 4π (1/plx)^2 * (1/plx^2) dplx) = 4π dplx / plx^4.

So, N = n * 4π dplx / plx^4.

But the question is about the number per unit range of plx, which is dN/dplx = 4 π n / plx^4.

So, the number per unit plx is inversely proportional to plx^4.

But that seems really high. I'm expecting that maybe the answer is 1/plx squared or something else.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the derivation. Let's think differently. Let's model the problem by considering the comoving volume as a function of parallax.

The number of stars with parallax between plx and plx + dplx is proportional to the volume between those parallaxes. But wait, in terms of distance, that's looking at a range of distances from d to d + dd, where d = 1/plx.

The volume for a thin shell at distance d is 4π d² dd. And dd = (d²) dplx. No, wait, because dd = d (dplx / (d plx)). Wait, no, perhaps it's better to express in terms of d.

Wait, plx = 1/d → d = 1/plx. So d changes as plx changes. So, when plx increases by dplx, d decreases by dd = - (1/plx^2) dplx.

So, the volume of the shell is 4π d² dd.

Substituting d = 1/plx and dd = -1/(plx^2) dplx, the volume is 4π (1/plx)^2 * (1/plx^2) dplx * (-1). But since volume can't be negative, we take absolute value, so the volume is 4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

So, the number of stars in that volume is n * 4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

So, the number per unit plx is (dN)/(dplx) = 4 π n / plx^4.

So, the number of stars per unit plx is proportional to 1/plx^4, which is option A.

Wait, but wait a second. I might be mixing up the number per unit plx. The question says "number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx)", which is the same as the number per dplx. So, yes, that's dN/dplx = C / plx^4.

But looking at the options, option A is ~1/plx^4.

Hmm, but in the past, I remember that the number of stars per unit distance (like per parsec) decreases as 1/d^2. Because the volume of the shell at distance d is proportional to d². So, if stars are uniformly distributed, the number in a shell is proportional to d². So, per unit distance, it's 1/d². Wait, but that's when you are integrating over distance. So, the number per unit distance is N = n * 4π d² * dd. So, number per unit distance (per parsec) is N per pc = n * 4π d².

Wait, but that's the number per distance, but in this problem, we're looking at number per parallax.

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think of it in terms of parallax.

The volume element for a small change in parallax dplx is dV = 4π (1/plx)^2 * (d dplx) where d is the distance (d=1/plx). Wait, no, because dV = 4π d² dd, and dd is the change in d.

But since plx = 1/d, then dd = -d^2 dplx. So, dV = 4π d² * (-d^2 dplx) → which is 4π (1/plx)^2 * (1/plx^2) dplx.

Wait, that's 4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

So, the number of stars is n * dV = n * 4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

So, the number per dplx is proportional to 1/plx^4, which is option A.

But wait, when I think about the distribution, if you have a fixed number density, the volume element in parallax space is smaller for larger plx (since plx is inverse of distance, the higher the plx, the closer the star, so the volume in that shell is smaller). So, the number of stars per unit plx would decrease as plx increases, which makes sense because as you look at closer stars (higher plx), the same volume element in plx space corresponds to a much larger volume in real space, hence more stars. Wait, no, that seems contradictory.

Wait, wait, perhaps I should think of this another way. Let's imagine that each star's position is determined by their distance (d) and direction (θ, φ).

Since the stars are uniformly distributed, n (number per volume) is constant.

The number of stars between distance d and d + dd is n * 4π d^2 dd.

But plx is 1/d. So, when plx increases by dplx, d decreases by dd = (d²) dplx.

So, substituting d = 1/plx, dd = (1/plx²) dplx.

So the number of stars between plx and plx + dplx is n * 4π (1/plx)^2 * (1/plx²) dplx = 4 π n dplx / plx^4.

Thus, the number of stars per unit plx (dN/dplx) is 4 π n / plx^4.

So, the number per unit plx is inversely proportional to plx^4. So, the answer should be option A, 1/plx^4.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the exponents. Let me check again.

Wait, 4π (d)^2 * dd. d is 1/plx. dd is (d²) dplx, which is (1/plx²) dplx.

So, substitution:

d^2 = (1/plx)^2 = 1/plx^2.

dd = 1/plx² dplx.

So, d^2 * dd = (1/plx^2) * (1/plx² dplx) ) = 1/plx^4 dplx.

So, yeah, 1/plx^4.

So, the number per unit plx is proportional to 1/plx^4, which is option A.

To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we start by noting that parallax is inversely proportional to distance: \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \), where \( d \) is the distance to the star in parsecs. The number of stars in a thin shell at distance \( d \) with thickness \( dd \) is proportional to the volume of the shell, which is given by \( 4\pi d^2 dd \). Substituting \( d = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \), we find:

\[
dd = -\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d\text{plx}.
\]

The volume of the shell in terms of parallax becomes:

\[
dV = 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{\text{plx}}\right)^2 \left(-\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d\text{plx}\right) = \frac{4\pi}{\text{plx}^4} d\text{plx}.
\]

The number of stars in this shell is proportional to the volume \( dV \), so the number of stars per unit range of parallax is:

\[
\frac{dN}{d\text{plx}} \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4}.
\]

This shows that the number of stars per unit range of parallax decreases as \( \text{plx}^{-4} \). Among the given options, this corresponds to:

**A) ~ \( \text{plx}^{-4} \)**.
