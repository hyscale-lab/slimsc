Okay, so I've got this problem about stars and their elemental abundances. Let's see what I can do. Hmm, the question is about finding the ratio of silicon atoms in two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. 

Alright, so let me read the problem again. Both stars have masses more than the Sun, but I don't think the mass plays into the elemental abundance directly. It's probably more about the given abundance ratios.

The given data is:
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex. Oh right, that's the logarithm of the ratio of Si to Fe abundances compared to the Sun. So [X/Y] = log(n_X/n_Y) - log(n_X/n_Y)_sun. So if [Si/Fe] is 0.3, that means Si is more abundant relative to Fe in Star_1 than in the Sun by a factor of 10^0.3.

Similarly, [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3. So Mg is more abundant compared to Si in Star_2 than in the Sun.

Then, [Fe/H]_1 is 0. H is hydrogen. [Fe/H] is the abundance of Fe relative to H. Since it's 0, that means [Fe/H]_1 = 0, so the Fe abundance in Star_1 is the same as in the Sun. Because the Sun's [Fe/H] is presumably 0 by definition.

Wait, wait, the question says to use the Sun's photospheric composition. The Sun's data is given as:
12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5. So log(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5. So nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5). Similarly, for Mg, 12 + log(nMg/nH)=7, so log(nMg/nH)= -5. So nMg/nH =10^-5.

So the Sun's Fe to H ratio is 10^-4.5, and Mg to H is 10^-5. 

But for Star_1: [Fe/H]_1 is 0. So nFe_1 /nH_1 = same as Sun. Because [Fe/H] = log(nFe/nH) - log_sun(nFe/nH) ) =0. So nFe_1/nH_1 = Sun's nFe/nH.

Wait, no. Because [Fe/H] is log(nFe/nH) - log_sun(nFe/nH) ) = 0. So nFe_1/nH_1 = (Sun's nFe/nH) * 10^0 = same as Sun. So Star_1 has same Fe/H as Sun. So Fe is same as in Sun, H is same? Or does the H vary? Hmm, because the star's atmosphere might have a different H abundance? Or is H considered to have the same as the Sun's?

Wait, no, in stellar atmospheres, [X/H] is the logarithm of the ratio of the element's abundance to hydrogen's. So if [Fe/H] is zero, Fe is at solar abundance compared to H. So if the Sun's [Fe/H] is zero, which it is by definition, then Star_1's Fe is same as Sun's. But what about H? Oh, wait, the H abundance in the star is determined by the sum of all the elements, but perhaps in this case, we're assuming that H is the same? Or am I getting this wrong?

Hmm, maybe I should approach this by first writing down the equations.

Let me think about each star.

Starting with Star_1:

Given [Fe/H]_1 = 0. So [Fe/H] = log( (nFe_1 / nH_1) ) - log( (nFe_sun / nH_sun) ) ) = 0.

We know that in the Sun, nFe_sun / nH_sun = 10^(-4.5) (from the given 12 + log(nFe/nH)=7.5 → log(nFe/nH)=7.5-12= -4.5 → nFe/nH=1e-4.5).

So for Star_1, log( (nFe_1 /nH_1) / (nFe_sun/nH_sun) ) )=0 → (nFe_1/nH_1) = (nFe_sun/nH_sun) → nFe_1 = nFe_sun * (nH_1 / nH_sun).

Wait, but without knowing the total hydrogen, maybe I can express everything in terms of the Sun's ratios.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the logarithmic abundances.

Similarly, [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3.

So [Si/Fe] = log(nSi_1/(nFe_1)) - log(nSi_sun/(nFe_sun)) ) = 0.3.

Since nFe_1 = nFe_sun * (nH_1 / nH_sun) → because [Fe/H]_1 is 0: nFe_1/nH_1 = nFe_sun/nH_sun → rearranged, nFe_1 = nFe_sun * (nH_1/nH_sun).

Wait, but I don't know anything about nH_1. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I can relate the abundances using the given [Fe/H], [Si/Fe], etc.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express the ratios in terms of the solar values.

Let me think about Star_1 first.

For Star_1:

[Fe/H]_1=0 → nFe_1 / nH_1 = nFe_sun / nH_sun.

[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → (nSi_1/nFe_1) / (nSi_sun/nFe_sun) ) = 10^0.3.

So nSi_1 = nFe_1 * (nSi_sun / nFe_sun) * 10^0.3.

But since nFe_1 = (nFe_sun / nH_sun) * nH_1,

Substituting:

nSi_1 = [ (nFe_sun / nH_sun) * nH_1 ] * (nSi_sun / nFe_sun) ) * 10^0.3.

Simplify:

The nFe_sun cancels out:

nSi_1 = (nH_1 / nH_sun) * (nSi_sun / nFe_sun) ) * nFe_sun * 10^0.3.

Wait, no, let me re-calculate.

Wait, the expression after substitution:

nSi_1 = (nFe_1) * (nSi_sun / nFe_sun) ) * 10^0.3.

But nFe_1 = (nFe_sun / nH_sun) * nH_1.

So substituting:

nSi_1 = ( (nFe_sun / nH_sun) * nH_1 ) * (nSi_sun / nFe_sun) ) * 10^0.3.

Here, the nFe_sun cancels:

(nFe_sun) cancels with (nFe_sun) denominator.

So nSi_1 = (nH_1 / nH_sun) * nSi_sun * 10^0.3.

Wait, because:

(nFe_sun /nH_sun) * nH_1 * (nSi_sun / nFe_sun ) = (nH_1/nH_sun) * nSi_sun.

So yes, that's correct.

So nSi_1 = (nH_1 /nH_sun) * nSi_sun * 10^0.3.

But nH_1 is the hydrogen in Star_1. Since in the Sun, nH_sun is the hydrogen.

Wait, but in this case, how do we relate the hydrogen? Because if the star's metallicity is the same as the Sun for Fe, does that mean for H it's the same? Probably not, because metallicity relates to heavier elements. So the H could be at a different level.

Wait, but if [Fe/H] is 0, that implies that the ratio nFe/nH is the same as the Sun. So nFe_1 = nFe_sun * (nH_1 / nH_sun). But without knowing nH_1, I can't directly find nSi_1 in terms of the Sun's nH_sun.

Hmm, perhaps I should make an assumption that the hydrogen is the same in both stars as in the Sun. But that might not be correct. Alternatively, perhaps the question is designed in a way that the hydrogen cancels out.

Wait, perhaps since the question is about the ratio of silicon atoms in the two stars, I can find the ratio [nSi_1 / nSi_2], and perhaps the hydrogen terms will cancel.

Wait, let me also think about Star_2.

For Star_2:

[Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 → log( (nMg_2 /nSi_2) / (nMg_sun /nSi_sun) ) ) = 0.3.

So (nMg_2 / nSi_2) = (nMg_sun /nSi_sun) * 10^0.3.

And [Mg/H]_2 =0 → nMg_2 / nH_2 = nMg_sun /nH_sun.

So nMg_2 = (nMg_sun /nH_sun) * nH_2.

Then, substituting into the [Mg/Si] equation:

(nMg_2 /nSi_2) = (nMg_sun / nSi_sun) *10^0.3.

So:

( (nMg_sun /nH_sun) *nH_2 ) / nSi_2 = (nMg_sun /nSi_sun ) *10^0.3.

Simplify:

(nMg_sun *nH_2 )/(nH_sun *nSi_2) ) = (nMg_sun /nSi_sun ) *10^0.3.

Multiply both sides by (nH_sun *nSi_2) /nMg_sun ):

nH_2 / nSi_2 = (nMg_sun *nH_sun *nSi_2 ) / (nH_sun *nMg_sun *nSi_sun ) ) *10^0.3.

Wait, perhaps that's complicating. Let's rearrange:

(nMg_2 /nSi_2 ) = (nMg_sun /nSi_sun ) *10^0.3.

But nMg_2 = (nMg_sun /nH_sun ) *nH_2.

Substitute that:

( (nMg_sun /nH_sun ) *nH_2 ) /nSi_2 = (nMg_sun /nSi_sun ) *10^0.3.

Cancel nMg_sun from numerator:

(nH_2 /nH_sun ) / nSi_2 = (1/nSi_sun) *10^0.3.

Multiply both sides by nSi_2 and nSi_sun:

nH_2 *nSi_sun = nH_sun *nSi_2 *10^0.3.

Wait, this might not get me much closer.

Alternatively, perhaps I should express nSi_1 and nSi_2 in terms of their respective stars' H and the Sun's values, then take the ratio.

Wait, let's go back to Star_1: nSi_1 = (nH_1 /nH_sun) * nSi_sun * 10^0.3.

And Star_2: I'll need to find nSi_2.

Wait, looking at Star_2's [Mg/Si] and [Mg/H]:

[Mg/Si]_2=0.3 → nMg_2/nSi_2 = (nMg_sun/nSi_sun) *10^0.3.

[Mg/H]_2 =0 → nMg_2/nH_2 = nMg_sun/nH_sun → nMg_2 = (nMg_sun/nH_sun)*nH_2.

Substitute into first equation:

( (nMg_sun/nH_sun) * nH_2 ) /nSi_2 = (nMg_sun/nSi_sun) *10^0.3.

Cancel nMg_sun:

(nH_2/nH_sun) /nSi_2 = (1/nSi_sun) *10^0.3.

Multiply both sides by nSi_2 and nSi_sun:

nH_2 * nSi_sun = nH_sun * nSi_2 *10^0.3.

Rearranged:

nSi_2 = (nH_2 /nH_sun) * (nSi_sun /10^0.3 ) .

Hmm, so now I have expressions for nSi_1 and nSi_2 in terms of their respective H.

But to find the ratio (nSi_1 / nSi_2 ), I can write:

(nSi_1) / (nSi_2 ) = [ (nH_1/nH_sun) * nSi_sun *10^0.3 ] / [ (nH_2/nH_sun) * nSi_sun /10^0.3 ].

Wait, let's plug in the expressions:

nSi_1 = (nH_1/nH_sun) *nSi_sun *10^0.3.

nSi_2 = (nH_2 /nH_sun) *nSi_sun /10^0.3.

Wait, no, wait. Earlier for Star_2, nSi_2 is (nH_2/nH_sun) *nSi_sun / 10^0.3.

Wait, no. Let me recheck:

I had for nSi_2:

nSi_2 = (nH_2 /nH_sun) * (nSi_sun /10^0.3 ) .

Yes, that's correct.

So the ratio would be:

(nSi_1) / (nSi_2 ) = [ (nH_1 /nH_sun) *nSi_sun *10^0.3 ] / [ (nH_2 /nH_sun) *nSi_sun /10^0.3 ) ].

Simplify numerator and denominator:

The nSi_sun cancels. The nH_sun denominators cancel.

So:

= [nH_1 * 10^0.3 ] / [nH_2 /10^0.3 ) ]

= [nH_1 * 10^0.3 ] * [10^0.3 / nH_2 ] 

= (nH_1 /nH_2 ) * (10^0.3 )^2.

But wait, I don't know nH_1 and nH_2. Hmm. Maybe I can relate them through another equation.

Wait, but I don't have any information about the hydrogen abundance relative to each other in the two stars. So perhaps I'm making a wrong assumption here.

Wait, but wait a minute. Let me think again.

Do I have any other data? The problem gives the photospheric composition for the Sun, and the [Fe/H], [Si/Fe], [Mg/Si] for the stars.

Wait, perhaps I can find the ratio of silicon by considering the element ratios relative to H in each star.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to figure out the abundance of silicon relative to hydrogen in each star, and then take their ratio.

Let me try that approach.

For Star_1:

We have [Fe/H]_1=0 → nFe_1 /nH_1 = nFe_sun /nH_sun.

We have [Si/Fe]_1=0.3 → nSi_1/nFe_1 = (nSi_sun /nFe_sun) *10^0.3.

So nSi_1 = nFe_1 * (nSi_sun /nFe_sun)*10^0.3.

But nFe_1 = (nFe_sun /nH_sun) *nH_1.

So substituting:

nSi_1 = (nFe_sun /nH_sun *nH_1) * (nSi_sun /nFe_sun ) *10^0.3.

Simplify:

nFe_sun cancels, so:

nSi_1 = (nH_1 /nH_sun) * (nSi_sun /1) *10^0.3.

So nSi_1 = (nH_1 /nH_sun) *nSi_sun *10^0.3.

But what's nSi_sun?

Wait, the Sun's photosphere has nFe and nMg given. So I can compute nSi_sun based on the other elements, but wait, the problem doesn't give nSi_sun. Hmm, maybe I can find it using the solar data.

Wait, the Sun's data is given as 12 + log(nFe/nH) =7.5 → log(nFe/nH) = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 1e-4.5.

Similarly, 12 + log(nMg/nH)=7 → log(nMg/nH) = -5 → nMg/nH=1e-5.

But we don't have nSi/nH for the Sun given. Hmm, perhaps I can infer it from the [Si/Fe] and [Mg/Si] ratios.

Wait, but no, because the problem doesn't provide those for the Sun. It only gives [Si/Fe]_1 and [Mg/Si]_2, which are for the stars, not the Sun.

Wait, but perhaps I can compute the Sun's [Mg/Si] ratio.

Wait, the Sun's [X/H] for Mg is 12 + log(nMg/nH) =7 → log(nMg/nH) = -5 → nMg/nH =1e-5.

Similarly, nFe/nH =1e-4.5.

But without nSi/nH, I can't compute it directly.

Wait, but perhaps we can express [Mg/Si] for the Sun. Because the Sun's [Mg/Si] is log(nMg/nSi) - log(nMg_sun/nSi_sun) = 0 (since it's the sun), so [Mg/Si]_sun=0.

Wait, no, that can't be. Wait, [X/Y] is log(nX/nY) - log(nX_sun/nY_sun). So [X/Y]_sun is zero for any X and Y.

So for the Sun, [Mg/Si]_sun = 0 → log( (nMg_sun/nSi_sun) ) - log( (nMg_sun/nSi_sun) ) =0.

Therefore, in the Sun, [Mg/Si] is 0.

But in Star_2, [Mg/Si] is 0.3. So Mg is more abundant relative to Si than in the Sun.

But without knowing the Sun's [Mg/Si], I can't proceed in that way.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again.

I need the ratio of silicon in Star_1 to Star_2.

So (nSi_1 /nH_1 ) / (nSi_2 /nH_2 ).

Because, the ratio of silicon atoms would be (nSi_1/nH_1) / (nSi_2/nH_2) ) * (nH_2/nH_1).

Wait, no, wait. The ratio (nSi_1)/(nSi_2) is equal to (nSi_1/nH_1) * (nH_1/nH_2) * (nH_2/nSi_2 ). Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio of silicon in the stars would be [Si/H]_1 divided by [Si/H]_2. Because [Si/H] is log(nSi/nH) - log_sun(nSi/nH).

Wait, but if I can compute [Si/H] for each star, then the ratio would be (10^{[Si/H]_1}) / (10^{[Si/H]_2} }) = 10^{([Si/H]_1 - [Si/H]_2)}.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute [Si/H] for each star.

So let's try that.

For Star_1:

We know [Fe/H]_1=0 → log(nFe_1/nH_1) = log(nFe_sun/nH_sun).

And [Si/Fe]_1=0.3 → log(nSi_1/nFe_1) = log(nSi_sun/nFe_sun) +0.3.

So let's write:

log(nFe_1/nH_1) = log(nFe_sun/nH_sun) → equation (1)

log(nSi_1/nFe_1) = log(nSi_sun/nFe_sun) +0.3 → equation (2)

We can add equations (1) and (2) to get log(nSi_1/nH_1) = log(nFe_sun/nH_sun) + log(nSi_sun/nFe_sun) +0.3.

Which is log(nSi_1/nH_1) = log( (nFe_sun /nH_sun ) * (nSi_sun /nFe_sun )) ) +0.3.

The nFe_sun cancels: (nFe_sun /nH_sun ) * (nSi_sun /nFe_sun ) = nSi_sun/(nH_sun).

So log(nSi_1/nH_1) = log(nSi_sun /nH_sun) +0.3.

Which means:

log(nSi_1/nH_1 ) = log(nSi_sun/nH_sun) +0.3.

Which implies:

log( (nSi_1/nH_1) / (nSi_sun /nH_sun) ) ) =0.3 → [Si/H]_1=0.3.

So [Si/H]_1=0.3.

Similarly, for Star_2:

[Mg/Si]_2=0.3 → log(nMg_2/nSi_2) = log(nMg_sun/nSi_sun) +0.3.

And [Mg/H]_2=0 → log(nMg_2/nH_2) = log(nMg_sun/nH_sun).

So, from equation (3): log(nMg_2/nH_2) = log(nMg_sun/nH_sun).

And equation (4): log(nMg_2/nSi_2) = log(nMg_sun/nSi_sun) +0.3.

Let me try to find [Si/H]_2.

We can write:

log(nMg_2/nH_2) = log(nMg_sun/nH_sun) → equation (3).

log(nMg_2/nSi_2) = log(nMg_sun/nSi_sun) +0.3 → equation (4).

From equation (3), nMg_2 = nMg_sun/nH_sun *nH_2.

Substitute into equation (4):

log( ( (nMg_sun /nH_sun ) *nH_2 ) /nSi_2 ) = log(nMg_sun /nSi_sun ) +0.3.

Simplify the left side:

log( (nMg_sun *nH_2 )/(nH_sun *nSi_2 ) ) = log(nMg_sun/nSi_sun ) +0.3.

Which can be written as:

log( (nMg_sun/nH_sun ) * (nH_2/nSi_2) ) = log(nMg_sun/nSi_sun ) +0.3.

Using log(a*b) = log a + log b:

log(nMg_sun/nH_sun) + log(nH_2/nSi_2) = log(nMg_sun/nSi_sun) +0.3.

We can rearrange:

log(nH_2/nSi_2) = log(nMg_sun/nSi_sun) - log(nMg_sun/nH_sun) ) +0.3.

Hmm, let me compute the right side.

log(nMg_sun/nSi_sun) - log(nMg_sun/nH_sun) ) = log( (nMg_sun/nSi_sun) / (nMg_sun/nH_sun) ) ) = log( nH_sun / nSi_sun ) = log( (nH_sun/nSi_sun) ) = log( (nH_sun /nSi_sun) ).

So:

log(nH_2/nSi_2) = log(nH_sun/nSi_sun) ) +0.3.

Which implies:

nH_2/nSi_2 = (nH_sun /nSi_sun ) *10^0.3.

So:

nH_2/nSi_2 = (nH_sun /nSi_sun ) *10^0.3.

Taking the reciprocal:

nSi_2 /nH_2 = (nSi_sun /nH_sun ) *10^{-0.3}.

So, [Si/H]_2 = log(nSi_2/nH_2 ) - log(nSi_sun/nH_sun ).

= log( (nSi_sun/nH_sun *10^{-0.3} ) ) - log(nSi_sun/nH_sun ).

= log( (nSi_sun/nH_sun) ) + log(10^{-0.3} ) - log(nSi_sun/nH_sun ).

The log(nSi_sun/nH_sun) cancels, leaving:

= log(10^{-0.3}) = -0.3.

So [Si/H]_2 = -0.3.

So now, for both stars, we've found [Si/H]:

Star_1: [Si/H]_1= 0.3.

Star_2: [Si/H]_2= -0.3.

The ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 to Star_2 would be 10^{([Si/H]_1 - [Si/H]_2)}.

Because [X/H] is log(nX/nH), so the ratio (nX_1/nH_1) / (nX_2/nH_2) ) = 10^{([X/H]_1 - [X/H]_2)}.

So:

Ratio = 10^{0.3 - (-0.3)} ) = 10^{0.6}.

What's 10^0.6? Let me think.

10^0.6 is approximately 3.98, which is about 4.

Looking back at the options, option A is ~3.9, so that would be the answer.

Wait, but let me double-check my steps.

1. For Star_1, I found [Si/H]=0.3. Correct.

Because [Fe/H]_1=0 means Fe is same as Sun. [Si/Fe]=0.3 means Si is 10^0.3 higher relative to Fe than the Sun. So [Si/H] = [Fe/H]_1 + [Si/Fe]_1= 0 +0.3=0.3.

Yes, that makes sense.

Similarly for Star_2:

[Mg/Si]_2=0.3 → [Mg/H]_2=0, so [Si/H]_2= [Mg/Si]_2 + [H/Mg]_2?

Wait, no. Because [Mg/Si]_2=0.3 → log(nMg/nSi) = log(nMg_sun/nSi_sun) +0.3.

And [Mg/H]_2=0 → log(nMg/nH) = log(nMg_sun/nH_sun).

So, subtracting these two equations:

log(nMg/nSi) - log(nMg/nH) = [Mg/Si]_2 - [Mg/H]_2.

Which is log( (nMg/nSi) / (nMg/nH) )) = [Mg/Si]_2 - [Mg/H]_2.

Which is log( nH/(nSi) ) = [Mg/Si]_2 - [Mg/H]_2.

So log(nH/nSi) =0.3 -0 → log(nH/nSi )=0.3 → log(nSi/nH )= -0.3 → [Si/H]_2= -0.3.

Yes, correct.

So the ratio of [Si] in Star_1 to Star_2 is 10^{0.6} ≈3.98, which is approximately 4. So the answer is option A, ~3.9.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2, we analyze the given elemental abundance data and use the relationships between the abundances.

### Key Data:
1. **Star_1**:
   - [Fe/H]_1 = 0: Fe abundance relative to H is the same as the Sun.
   - [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3: Si is 10^0.3 times more abundant relative to Fe than in the Sun.

2. **Star_2**:
   - [Mg/H]_2 = 0: Mg abundance relative to H is the same as the Sun.
   - [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3: Mg is 10^0.3 times more abundant relative to Si than in the Sun.

3. **Sun's Photospheric Composition**:
   - 12 + log(nFe/nH) = 7.5 → log(nFe/nH) = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^-4.5.
   - 12 + log(nMg/nH) = 7 → log(nMg/nH) = -5 → nMg/nH = 10^-5.

### Analysis:
#### For Star_1:
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 implies nFe_1/nH_1 = nFe_sun/nH_sun.
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 implies nSi_1/nFe_1 = (nSi_sun/nFe_sun) × 10^0.3.
- Substituting nFe_1 = (nFe_sun/nH_sun) × nH_1 into the above equation:
  \[
  nSi_1 = nH_1 × \left(\frac{nSi_sun}{nH_sun}\right) × 10^{0.3}.
  \]
- Thus, the silicon-to-hydrogen ratio in Star_1 is:
  \[
  \frac{nSi_1}{nH_1} = \frac{nSi_sun}{nH_sun} × 10^{0.3}.
  \]
- This corresponds to [Si/H]_1 = 0.3.

#### For Star_2:
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 implies nMg_2/nH_2 = nMg_sun/nH_sun.
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 implies nMg_2/nSi_2 = (nMg_sun/nSi_sun) × 10^0.3.
- Substituting nMg_2 = (nMg_sun/nH_sun) × nH_2 into the above equation:
  \[
  \frac{nH_2}{nSi_2} = \frac{nH_sun}{nSi_sun} × 10^{0.3}.
  \]
- Rearranging gives:
  \[
  \frac{nSi_2}{nH_2} = \frac{nSi_sun}{nH_sun} × 10^{-0.3}.
  \]
- This corresponds to [Si/H]_2 = -0.3.

#### Ratio of Silicon Atoms:
The ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 to Star_2 is given by:
\[
\frac{nSi_1}{nSi_2} = \frac{\left(\frac{nSi_1}{nH_1}\right)}{\left(\frac{nSi_2}{nH_2}\right)} = \frac{10^{[Si/H]_1}}{10^{[Si/H]_2}} = 10^{[Si/H]_1 - [Si/H]_2}.
\]
Substituting [Si/H]_1 = 0.3 and [Si/H]_2 = -0.3:
\[
\frac{nSi_1}{nSi_2} = 10^{0.3 - (-0.3)} = 10^{0.6}.
\]
Approximating 10^0.6 ≈ 3.98, the ratio is approximately **3.9**.

### Final Answer:
The ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2 is **~3.9**.
