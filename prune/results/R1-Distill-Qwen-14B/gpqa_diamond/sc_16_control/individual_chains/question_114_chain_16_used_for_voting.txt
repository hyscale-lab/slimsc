Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the right reagents for two reactions. Hmm, let me start by reading the question carefully.

The first reaction is between butan-2-one and NaCN with reagent A, producing 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction uses the product from the first, treating it with reagent B (in H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

Wait, wait. Wait, the second starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. So the nitrile group is present there, and it's being converted into a carboxylic acid after treatment with B and water.

Let me break this down step by step.

First reaction: butan-2-one + NaCN + A → 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile.

Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, so it's a ketone. NaCN is sodium cyanide, which is a nucleophile. So probably, this is a nucleophilic addition to the ketone.

In a carbonyl reaction, the nucleophile (CN-) attacks the carbonyl carbon. But wait, when you add NaCN to a ketone, typically you get a cyanohydrin formation. Oh right, that's right. The cyanide adds to the carbonyl, and the proton from the acid (since you need some H+ to protonate the carbonyl oxygen) goes to the oxygen, leading to the formation of a cyanohydrin.

So the product is a secondary alcohol with a cyanide group attached. Which matches the product given: 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile.

Wait, but butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, so when CN- adds, the structure becomes (CH3)2C(OH)CN. Wait, wait, maybe I should think about it more. Let me draw it.

Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. When the CN- attacks, the oxygen becomes O- which then picks up a proton. So the product would be (CH3)2C(OH)CN. But wait, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me see: the butanenitrile part is four carbons with the nitrile. So the structure would be CH2-C(OH)(CH3)-CH2-CN? No, wait, butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. So when CN- adds, the product would be (CH3)2C(OH)CN. But that would be 2-hydroxy-2-methylpropanenitrile? Or wait, but the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So maybe the starting ketone is butan-2-one, which has three carbons (since butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, which is three carbons: CH3-CO-CH3. Wait, no, butan-2-one has four carbons. Wait, no, butan-2-one is actually (CH3)2CO, which is propan-2-one, not butan. Wait, wait. Let me check: butan-2-one is (CH2)2CO, but that would be pentan-2-one. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Butan-2-one is CH3-CO-CH2-CH3? No, wait that can't be. Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)COCH2CH3? No, that would be pentan-3-one. Wait, maybe it's CH3-C(O)-CH2-CH3. No, no. Wait, butan-2-one is CH2(CO)CH2CH3? No, I'm getting stuck. Alternatively, perhaps it's (CH3)2CO, which is acetone, which is propan-2-one. Maybe the question has a typo? Or perhaps the product is correct as given.

But regardless, the reaction is a ketone reacting with CN- to form a cyanohydrin. So, the reagent A must be a source of acid to protonate the oxygen after the attack. Because in the cyanohydrin formation, the mechanism requires that the carbonyl oxygen is protonated, making it more electrophilic, so that the CN- can attack.

Wait, but wait, when you add a nucleophile like CN- to a ketone, you usually need an acid catalyst. So the reagent A should be an acid, like H3O+ (acidic conditions) or perhaps another strong acid.

So for the first reaction, A is H3O+ probably. Because NaCN is a strong nucleophile, and the reaction is done under acidic conditions to drive the formation of the cyanohydrin.

Now the second reaction: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (in H2O) → 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

So the starting material is a nitrile with a hydroxyl group on the adjacent carbon. Wait, but wait, the starting material is 2-hydroxybutanenitrile with a 4-benzylphenyl group attached. So the structure must be something like:

Ph-C6H4-CH2-C(OH)CH2CN? Hmm, perhaps I'm not getting the structure right. Alternatively, the structure is (Ph-4-benzyl) attached to the 2nd carbon of butanenitrile, which also has a hydroxyl group on the same carbon.

Wait, but the product is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. So the nitrile (CN) group has been converted into a carboxylic acid (COOH) group.

So the reaction is nitrile → carboxylic acid. How does that happen?

Nitrile to carboxylic acid typically involves hydrolysis. Nitriles can be hydrolyzed under acidic or basic conditions. Let me think about the reagents.

In acidic conditions, nitriles hydrolyze to carboxylic acids. But in basic conditions, they hydrolyze to carboxylates, which can then be acidified to carboxylic acids.

So, if the second reaction is using reagent B in water, perhaps B is an acid catalyst, or a base, depending on the reaction.

Wait, the starting material has a hydroxyl group adjacent to the nitrile. So the structure is hydroxyl (OH) and nitrile (CN) on the same carbon. So when that nitrile is hydrolyzed, it will form a carboxylic acid on that same carbon. But wait, nitriles on a carbon adjacent to a hydroxyl group may undergo different reactions.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is an oxidation. Alternatively, maybe it's a hydrolysis. Let me think about the possible reagents.

Wait, another possibility: the nitrile is being hydrolyzed under specific conditions. If reagent B is HCl, which is a strong acid, then in acidic conditions, the nitrile would hydrolyze to a carboxylic acid.

But wait, the presence of the hydroxyl group adjacent to the nitrile... Maybe it's a hydrolysis that's facilitated by an acid, like HCl.

Wait, but another possibility is that the nitrile is being treated with an acid, perhaps in the presence of some oxidizing agent. Hmm, but the question says that reagent B is used in H2O, so maybe it's an acid hydrolysis.

Alternatively, I know that when a nitrile is treated with dilute acid, like H2SO4 and heat, it hydrolyzes to a carboxylic acid. But sometimes, in some cases, to a ketone if there's a neighboring group.

Wait, but in this case, the nitrile is adjacent to a hydroxyl group. So perhaps the nitrile is first protonated, then undergoes some kind of addition, leading to the formation of a carboxylic acid.

Wait, another thought: maybe the hydroxyl group is involved in the hydrolysis. Could it be a case where the nitrile is hydrolyzed under acidic conditions to form a carboxylic acid, but the hydroxyl group is somehow involved in that process?

Alternatively, perhaps reagent B is a strong acid, like HCl, which provides the H+ for the hydrolysis.

So putting it all together, in the first reaction, reagent A is H3O+ (acid), because we're forming a cyanohydrin (nucleophilic addition to a ketone). In the second reaction, reagent B is HCl (acid), which provides the conditions for the nitrile to hydrolyze to a carboxylic acid.

Looking at the options:

Option A: A = H3O+, B=HCl. That fits.

Option B: A = H3O+, B=CH3COOH. That could also be acidic, but CH3COOH is a weaker acid. Maybe HCl is stronger, required for hydrolysis.

Option C: A=NaHSO3, B=HCl. Not sure about that. NaHSO3 is a source of H+ and SO3^2-? But in the first reaction, adding NaHSO3 would provide H+ for the acid catalyst, but perhaps not? Or is there another reaction?

Wait, wait. Another possibility for the first reaction: maybe A isn't H3O+ but another acid. Let me think. The first reaction is a cyanohydrin formation. The usual conditions for that are using an acid catalyst. So H3O+ (like H2SO4) would be used. So in the options, only options A and B have A as H3O+.

Wait, but what about the second reaction. Let's think again.

The second reaction: nitrile → carboxylic acid. For that, you can have strong acidic conditions, like H2SO4 and heat, but sometimes other acids are used. HCl is a strong acid and can serve as a catalyst for the hydrolysis of nitriles. Alternatively, sometimes H2O with acid (like HCl) can hydrolyze nitriles to carboxylic acids, especially with heat.

Wait, but in the second reaction, the reagent B is in H2O. So perhaps B is the acid, like HCl, which would make the solution acidic, allowing the nitrile to hydrolyze.

So putting it all together, option A has A as H3O+ and B as HCl, which aligns with both reactions.

Wait, but let me think again about the conditions for the second reaction. Another possibility is that the nitrile is treated with a base, like NaOH, which would produce a carboxylate, and then acidified to give the carboxylic acid. But in the question, the reagent B is in H2O, so perhaps it's an acidic hydrolysis.

Alternatively, another reagent that can initiate hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids is using a strong acid. So HCl in water would be suitable for that.

So the first reaction uses H3O+ (A is H3O+), and the second uses HCl (B is HCl).

Looking at the options:

Option A: A = H3O+, B = HCl. Correct.

Option B: A = H3O+, B = CH3COOH. But CH3COOH is a weak acid. Would it be sufficient for the hydrolysis? I think HCl is stronger and more likely to drive the reaction to completion.

Option C: A = NaHSO3, B=HCl. Not sure why NaHSO3 would be used, but maybe NaHSO3 is a source of H+ too. But I think the first reaction needs an acid catalyst, and NaHSO3 can provide H+ (since HSO3^- is a weak acid). So perhaps that would work for the first reaction, but I'm not sure if it's the preferred reagent.

Wait, but NaHSO3 is a sodium bisulfite, which is often used in reactions where a mild acid is needed, such as in the hydroboration reaction or in some oxidations. But for a cyanohydrin formation, a strong acid like H2SO4 (which would give H3O+) is usually used.

So perhaps option C is not correct for the first reaction.

So the correct option is A: A = H3O+, B = HCl.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The first reaction involves the formation of a cyanohydrin from butan-2-one and NaCN. This reaction requires an acid catalyst to protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making it more electrophilic for the nucleophilic attack by CN⁻. Among the options, H₃O⁺ (a strong acid) is the most suitable reagent for this purpose.

The second reaction converts the nitrile group in 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile into a carboxylic acid. This is achieved through hydrolysis, which typically requires acidic conditions. HCl, being a strong acid, provides the necessary acidic environment for the hydrolysis of the nitrile to the carboxylic acid.

Analyzing the options:
- **Option A**: A = H₃O⁺, B = HCl. This matches the requirements for both reactions.
- **Option B**: A = H₃O⁺, B = CH₃COOH. While H₃O⁺ is suitable for the first reaction, CH₃COOH (a weak acid) is less effective for the hydrolysis of the nitrile in the second reaction compared to HCl.
- **Option C**: A = NaHSO₃, B = HCl. NaHSO₃ is not ideal for the first reaction, as it is not a strong enough acid to efficiently catalyze cyanohydrin formation.
- **Option D**: A = NaHSO₃, B = CH₃COOH. Both reagents are unsuitable for their respective reactions.

Thus, the correct choice is **Option A**, where A = H₃O⁺ and B = HCl.

Answer: A
