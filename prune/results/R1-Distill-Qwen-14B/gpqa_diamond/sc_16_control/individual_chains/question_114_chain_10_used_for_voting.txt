Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about selecting the correct reagents for two reactions. Let me read it carefully.

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to give 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction takes 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile and reagent B (which is H2O) to produce 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. The options are A to D, each giving possible reagents A and B.

Hmm, I remember that nitriles can be formed from ketones through a substitution reaction. Oh wait, that's the cyanide addition to ketones. So when a ketone like butan-2-one reacts with NaCN, it's probably undergoing an addition. But wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. So adding NaCN would typically give (CH3)2C(OH)CN? Or wait, maybe it's a different product. Wait, the product given is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me write that structure.

Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. When you add NaCN, which is a source of CN-, it's a nucleophilic addition. So the mechanism would be that the carbonyl oxygen is attacked by the cyanide, leading to the formation of an alkoxide intermediate. Then, perhaps an acid work-up is done. So the product would have an -OH group and a nitrile group attached to the same carbon.

Wait, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The structure would be (CH3)C(OH)-CH2-CN? Or wait, but wait: butanenitrile is CH3CH2CH2CN. But 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile would be (CH3)2C(OH)-CH2CN? Wait, no, maybe I'm getting that wrong. Let me think. Butanenitrile is four carbons, nitrile on the end. So butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO.

So adding NaCN to butan-2-one would give (CH3)2C(OH)CN. Wait, but that's a secondary alcohol with a nitrile group attached. So the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylpropanenitrile? Wait, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the product is (CH3)2CH(OH)CN? No, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again.

Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Adding HCN (from NaCN in acidic conditions) would form (CH3)2C(OH)CN. Then, in the presence of acid, perhaps it's protonated. But wait, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN, but the product has four carbons, including the nitrile. So the product would be CH(CH3)(OH)CH2CN? No, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the product is (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN. Wait, no, butanenitrile is four carbons, so maybe it's (CH3)2CH(OH)CN. But that would be 3-hydroxy-3-methylbutanenitrile? Hmm, I'm a bit confused about the structure.

Wait, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So the nitrile is on carbon 4, and the hydroxy and methyl are on carbon 2. So structure would be CH2-C(OH)(CH3)-CH2-CN? No, because butanenitrile is four carbons, so the nitrile is on C4. So the molecule would be CH2-CHOH-CH(CH3)-CN? That doesn't seem right. Maybe I'm mixing up the numbering.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is (CH3)2C(OH)-CH2CN. That would be 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Because the parent chain is butane, so four carbons. The nitrile is on the first carbon, then the second has the hydroxy and methyl groups. So the structure is CH2CN-CH(CH3)OH-CH2? No, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Maybe it's (CH3)2C(OH)CN, which is 2-hydroxy-2-methylpropanenitrile. Hmm, I'm not sure about the exact product, but let's think about the reagents.

So the first step is NaCN and reagent A. NaCN is a source of cyanide ions. So perhaps this is a nucleophilic addition to the ketone. Then, the reaction is typically done in an acidic work-up, so maybe A is an acid, like H3O+ (proton source) or something else. So the reaction is the addition of HCN to the ketone, forming a cyanohydrin.

So the first reagent A would be H3O+ or maybe something else. Looking at the options, options A and B have A as H3O+; options C and D have A as NaHSO3.

Wait, but NaHSO3 is sodium bisulfate, which is a source of H+ and HSO3^- ions. So if A is NaHSO3, perhaps it's providing the acidic conditions for the reaction. Alternatively, H3O+ would be providing H+ for the acid work-up.

So in the first reaction, perhaps the ketone reacts with NaCN in the presence of an acid. So the cyanide ion attacks the carbonyl, forms the alkoxide, which is protonated to give the cyanohydrin. So A would be H3O+, right? Because after the nucleophilic addition, you typically acidify to protonate.

So for the first step, the reagent A is probably an acid, H3O+.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A: A = H3O+, B = HCl
Option B: A = H3O+, B = CH3COOH
Options C and D: A = NaHSO3, which is a source of H+ but not as strong as H3O+.

So if A is H3O+, then either options A or B are possible.

Moving on to the second reaction. The starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. And reagent B is H2O. The product is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. So the nitrile group is being converted into a carboxylic acid.

Wait, how does a nitrile become a carboxylic acid? I think that's typically done through hydrolysis. Nitriles can be hydrolyzed under acidic or basic conditions to form amides or carboxylic acids. For acid hydrolysis, you usually use H3O+ and heat. Alternatively, under basic conditions, you might get a sodium salt, which you can then acidify.

Wait, the reagent B here is H2O, but what's the actual reagent? Because B is part of the options. Wait, no, the question says the reagent is B, and the solvent is H2O. So the product is a carboxylic acid, so the reaction must be hydrolysis of the nitrile to the acid.

So for the hydrolysis of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid, you usually use strong acid conditions. Alternatively, you can use a strong base, but then you have to acidify the solution afterward.

Looking at the options for B: options A's B is HCl, option B is CH3COOH (acetic acid), option C is HCl, and D is acetic acid.

Wait, the second step is the hydrolysis of the nitrile group to a carboxylic acid. So the reagent B would be an acid catalyst, like HCl, or perhaps something else.

Wait, the reagent in the second reaction is B. So the reagent is the same as the one in the options. So in the second reaction, they add reagent B (which is H2O?), no, wait. The problem says reagent B is H2O? Wait, no.

Wait, the second reaction is written as:

2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H2O) ---> product.

Wait, perhaps I'm misreading. Maybe the reagent is B, and the solvent is H2O. Or perhaps B is the catalyst, and the reaction is done in water. Hmm.

Wait, the problem says: the second reaction uses reagent B and H2O as a reagent. So perhaps the reagent is B, and the solvent is water.

Wait, the way it's written is:

2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H2O) → product.

Wait, perhaps the plus sign isn't just for reagents but also indicates the reaction conditions. Alternatively, maybe B is the catalyst, and H2O is the solvent.

But the product is a carboxylic acid. So the reaction is hydrolysis of nitrile to carboxylic acid. Which conditions are used for that? Typically, strong acid (like HCl) and heat. Alternatively, under basic conditions with H2O, you get the corresponding sodium salt, which then is acidified.

So for the second step, the reagent B would be an acid, like HCl (H3O+ or H2SO4), or maybe a base with subsequent acid work-up.

Wait, but in the options for B, when the first part (A) is H3O+, the B options are HCl and CH3COOH. So if in the second reaction, HCl is used, that would make sense as a strong acid catalyst for the hydrolysis.

Alternatively, if B is CH3COOH, that's a weaker acid. So maybe the reaction in the second step requires a strong acid for efficient hydrolysis.

So, putting it together, for the first reaction, the reagent A is H3O+ (to protonate the intermediate after NaCN addition), and for the second reaction, reagent B is HCl (acid for hydrolysis).

Looking at the options, option A is A=H3O+, B=HCl, which matches this.

Wait, but let me make sure. Let me think about the first reaction. When a ketone reacts with NaCN, the usual reaction is the formation of a cyanohydrin. The mechanism involves the attack of the cyanide ion on the carbonyl carbon, forming an alkoxide intermediate. Then, to protonate, you need an acid. So the work-up is typically done under acidic conditions, like H3O+. So A is H3O+.

In the second reaction, the nitrile group is converted to a carboxylic acid. The typical way is to perform a hydrolysis. For nitrile to carboxylic acid, either strong acid with H2O and heat, or using a strong base with H2O followed by acid work-up. But in the options, B is either HCl, acetic acid, etc.

If the reaction uses HCl as a catalyst (B=HCl), then that would provide the acidic conditions needed for the hydrolysis. Alternatively, if B were a base, like NaOH, then after hydrolysis, you would need to add acid, but the options don't include that.

So if the second step uses HCl (option A's B), that would fit. So the correct reagents would be A=H3O+, B=HCl, which is option A.

Wait, but let me check the options again.

Option A: A = H3O+, B = HCl.

Yes, that fits. So the answer would be option A.

Wait, but another possibility: maybe the second step uses CH3COOH as the reagent. Would that work? Because acetic acid is a weak acid. I'm not sure if that's strong enough for the hydrolysis. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction uses H2O with HCl as a catalyst, which would make sense.

So I think option A is the correct choice.

The question involves selecting the correct reagents for two reactions. The first reaction involves the addition of NaCN to butan-2-one to form 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, and the second reaction involves the hydrolysis of a nitrile group to a carboxylic acid.

### Analysis of the First Reaction:
Butan-2-one reacts with NaCN in the presence of an acidic work-up to form a cyanohydrin, 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. This reaction typically requires an acid to protonate the intermediate alkoxide. Among the options, **H₃O⁺** (proton source) is the most suitable reagent for this step, as it provides the necessary acidic conditions.

### Analysis of the Second Reaction:
The second reaction involves the hydrolysis of a nitrile group to a carboxylic acid. This process typically requires acidic conditions. Among the options, **HCl** is a strong acid and an effective catalyst for this hydrolysis. While CH₃COOH (acetic acid) is also acidic, it is a weaker acid and less suitable for efficient hydrolysis compared to HCl.

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A:** A = H₃O⁺, B = HCl  
  This matches the requirements for both reactions. H₃O⁺ is suitable for the first reaction, and HCl is appropriate for the second reaction.  
- **Option B:** A = H₃O⁺, B = CH₃COOH  
  While H₃O⁺ is correct for the first reaction, CH₃COOH is not strong enough for the hydrolysis in the second reaction.  
- **Option C:** A = NaHSO₃, B = HCl  
  NaHSO₃ is not suitable for the first reaction, as it does not provide the necessary acidic conditions for the cyanohydrin formation.  
- **Option D:** A = NaHSO₃, B = CH₃COOH  
  NaHSO₃ is not suitable for the first reaction, and CH₃COOH is not strong enough for the second reaction.

### Conclusion:
The correct reagents are **A = H₃O⁺** for the first reaction and **B = HCl** for the second reaction, which corresponds to **Option A**.

Answer: A
