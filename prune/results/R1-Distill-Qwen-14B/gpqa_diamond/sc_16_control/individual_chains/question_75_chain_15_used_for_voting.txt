Okay, so I'm trying to figure out why the GADD45G protein isn't being overexpressed in the Chinese hamster ovary cells. Let's go through the problem step by step.

The setup is that a researcher wants to create a transgenic mouse model where GADD45G is overexpressed. They introduced a sequence for the influenza hemagglutinin antigen at the N-terminus of the coding sequence. They transfected the plasmid into CHO cells, but the protein isn't overexpressing. So, they need to find out why.

The given plus strand sequence of the construct is long, so I should look for possible issues in the coding sequence. Let's think about potential problems that could prevent proper protein expression.

Option A says the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation. That could cause the protein to not be expressed if the mutation is in a critical region, but I don't know the exact sequence of the hemagglutinin. Looking at the beginning of the construct, the first few codons are ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTA... Wait, let's look. The start is ATG, which is methionine, the start codon. Then TAC is tyrosine, CCA is proline, TAC is tyrosine, GAT is aspartic acid, GTA is valine, etc. So the initial sequence after ATG is TAC, which is a codon for tyrosine. If the hemagglutinin was added at the N-terminus, perhaps it's before the ATG. But wait, in the provided sequence, the very first thing is ATG, which would be the start codon. Hmm, maybe the hemagglutinin was inserted as a tag before the ATG? Or perhaps they inserted it into the ATG, disrupting it. Wait, if the construct was designed to add HA at the N-terminus, the HA sequence would be before the ATG. So the plasmid would have the HA coding sequence followed by ATG and the GADD45G ORF.

But the given sequence starts with ATG, which is the start codon. So maybe the HA wasn't inserted correctly. Alternatively, perhaps the HA sequence is after the start codon, leading to a frameshift or incorrect reading.

Alternatively, maybe the HA insertion disrupted the reading frame. Let's think about the HA sequence. The HA tag is usually a peptide from the influenza hemagglutinin protein, like YPYDVPDYA. Its coding sequence would be something like TAC CCA TAC GAT GTA CCA TCC... Wait, looking at the sequence, the start is ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTA CCA TCC... So the first codon is ATG (M), next TAC (Y), CCA (P), TAC (Y), GAT (D), GTA (V), etc. Wait, that's exactly the HA tag sequence! Because the HA tag is TYPYDVPDYA or something similar. Let me count: TAC is Y, CCA is P, TAC is Y, GAT is D, GTA is V, TCC is S, etc. Wait, but the HA tag is around 11 amino acids. Let me check the first 11 codons.

The first 11 codons after ATG would be:

1. ATG - M
2. TAC - Y
3. CCA - P
4. TAC - Y
5. GAT - D
6. GTA - V
7. TCC - S
8. ATG - M (Wait, no, the 7th codon is TCC, then the 8th is ATG? Wait no, let me read the sequence again.

The given sequence is:

5'ATGTACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCCAAATGACTCTGGAAGAAGTCCGCGGCCAGGACACAGTTCCGGAAAGCACAGCCAGGATGCAGGGTGCCGGGAAAGCGCTGCATGAGTTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA3'

So, breaking it down into triplets:

ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTA TCC AGA TTA CGC CAA ATG ACT CTG GAA GAA GTC CGC GCC AGG ACA CAG TTC CGG AAA GCA CAG CCA GGA TGC AGG GTG CCG GAA AGC GCT GCA TGA GTT GCT GCT GTC GGC GCA GCG TCA GGG CTG CTC ACT GCC GGC GTCT ACG AGT CAG CCA AAG TCT TGA ACG TGG ACC CCC GAC AAT GTG ACC TTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGG GTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATC CATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATA GTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA

Wait, the first few codons are ATG, TAC, CCA, TAC, GAT, GTA, TCC, AGA, TTA, CGC, CAA, ATG, ACT, CTG, GAA, GAA, GTC, etc.

So the first 12 codons after ATG would be:

1. ATG - M (start)
2. TAC - Y
3. CCA - P
4. TAC - Y
5. GAT - D
6. GTA - V
7. TCC - S
8. AGA - R
9. TTA - L
10. CGC - R
11. CAA - Q
12. ATG - M

Wait a second, so the 12th codon is ATG again. That's a problem because ATG is the start codon. That would mean that the reading frame is resetting here. So the initial part is ATG followed by TAC, CCA, etc., but then at the 12th codon, another ATG. So the protein would start at the first ATG, then proceed until the second ATG, which is codon 12, and then start a new frame.

But wait, how does that work? If the first ATG is at position 1, the next ATG is at position 12 (which is 12/3=4th codon after the start), so the first 11 codons would be part of the ORF, then the 12th codon is another ATG, which would serve as a start codon. So the initial coding sequence would be GADD45G with an HA tag?

Wait, perhaps the HA tag was incorrectly inserted, causing a frameshift or an additional start codon.

Alternatively, perhaps the HA tag was inserted into the GADD45G gene, but the way it was done caused a problem in the reading frame. Let's think: the HA tag is about 11 amino acids, so that's 33 base pairs. So if the insertion is done correctly, the reading frame would continue seamlessly. But if the insertion was done in a way that disrupts the frame, that's a problem.

Looking at the sequence, the first ATG is the start, then the next 11 codons, and then another ATG. Hmm, that's a bit odd. So the first 12 codons would be:

1. ATG (M)
2. TAC (Y)
3. CCA (P)
4. TAC (Y)
5. GAT (D)
6. GTA (V)
7. TCC (S)
8. AGA (R)
9. TTA (L)
10. CGC (R)
11. CAA (Q)
12. ATG (M)

So the 12th codon is another ATG, which is a start codon. That could be a problem because the ribosome would start at the first ATG, translate up to the 12th codon, which is another ATG, and perhaps the ribosome could terminate early if there's a stop codon nearby, or it could cause a frameshift after that.

Wait, but the original GADD45G gene's coding sequence would have only one start codon, the first ATG. If the construct includes an additional ATG in the middle, which is another start codon, that could cause the ribosome to start translating again, possibly leading to a shorter protein if a stop codon is present before the original ORF's end.

Alternatively, perhaps the additional ATG is causing the ribosome to terminate early. How? Let's see, if the ribosome starts at the first ATG, and then at the 12th codon (position 36), it hits another ATG. If the ribosome doesn't read beyond that, perhaps because the next codon is a stop, but let me check.

Looking at the sequence after the 12th codon, which is ATG (position 36). The next codon would be ACT (codon 13), which is Thr. So the ribosome wouldn't stop unless there's a stop codon. So the presence of another ATG in the middle of the ORF might not necessarily cause termination unless the ribosome is reading in a way that it starts a new frame. But wait, the ribosome doesn't typically start in the middle unless there's a Shine-Dalgarno sequence or something, which isn't present here.

Alternatively, perhaps the second ATG is causing a frameshift because the initial insertion of the HA tag was done incorrectly. Let's think: the HA tag is usually inserted before the start codon. So the plasmid would have HA coding sequence, then ATG, then GADD45G. If the HA sequence is inserted in a way that the reading frame is shifted, then the ATG would be in a different frame, leading to a frameshift.

Wait, but in the given sequence, the first codon is ATG, and the following are as I listed before. So maybe the HA tag was inserted correctly, but within the HA tag, there's an in-frame ATG, causing the ribosome to read it as a start codon and terminate early. Let's look at the HA tag sequence. The HA tag is usually around 11 amino acids, and the coding sequence is about 33 bases. So the first 11 codons after the initial ATG are part of the HA tag. But then the 12th codon is another ATG, which would be in the same frame as the original start. So the ribosome would read this ATG as a start codon, but since it's in the middle, what would happen?

Wait, the ribosome translates from the start codon until it hits a stop codon. If there's another ATG in the middle, the ribosome won't necessarily restart unless it's in a new frame with a Shine-Dalgarno sequence, which doesn't happen in eukaryotes. So perhaps the presence of another ATG doesn't cause a problem, but maybe it does something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the HA tag was inserted after the start codon, causing an extra start codon. Wait, no, because the HA is at the N-terminus. So the HA would come before the ATG, so the construct would be HA sequence followed by ATG and the GADD45G ORF. But in the given sequence, the first thing is ATG, so maybe the HA wasn't inserted correctly.

Wait, perhaps the HA sequence was inserted into the start codon, disrupting it. For instance, if the HA sequence was inserted into the ATG, changing it. Let's see: the first codon is ATG, which is correct. But the HA tag's first few codons are TAC (Y), CCA (P), TAC (Y), etc., which are the first codons after ATG. So the HA is correctly inserted after the ATG.

Wait, maybe the problem is that the HA sequence introduces a stop codon in the reading frame. Let me check the first 12 codons:

ATG (M), TAC (Y), CCA (P), TAC (Y), GAT (D), GTA (V), TCC (S), AGA (R), TTA (L), CGC (R), CAA (Q), ATG (M).

No stop codons in the first 12 codons. So the ribosome would continue translating until it hits a stop codon in the original GADD45G sequence. So why isn't the protein being expressed?

Another possibility is that the HA tag is causing the protein to be recognized and degraded by the cell's proteasomes. The HA tag is often used for purification, but sometimes, if the tag is not properly expressed or if it's in the wrong place, the cell might degrade the protein. But the question says that the protein isn't being overexpressed, not that it's expressed but degraded.

Looking at the options:

Option B says the ribosome terminated early. That would happen if there's a stop codon in the mRNA before the end of the GADD45G ORF.

Looking at the sequence, do any of the codons in the HA tag part or the GADD45G part have a stop codon (TAA, TAG, or TGA) in frame?

Let me check the first few codons:

ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTA TCC AGA TTA CGC CAA ATG ACT CTG GAA GAA GTC CGC GCC AGG ACA CAG TTC ...

So looking for TGA, TAA, TAG.

TAC is Y, not a stop.

GAT is D, GTA is V, TCC is S, AGA is R, TTA is L, CGC is R, CAA is Q, ATG is M, ACT is T, CTG is L, GAA is E, GAA is E, etc.

So in the first part, no stop codons. The TTA is L, so not a stop. The next part? Let's see:

Looking along the sequence, I don't see any TGA, TAG, or TAA in the first few codons. So the presence of another ATG doesn't introduce a stop codon, unless it's in a different frame. Wait, perhaps the second ATG is causing a frameshift.

Wait, maybe the HA insertion caused a frameshift. Let's see: HA is about 11 codons, so 33 bp. If the insertion wasn't a multiple of three, it would cause a frameshift. But the initial sequence starts with ATG and the next 33 bases (11 codons) are in frame. So if HA is correctly inserted, the frame continues.

Wait, but in the given sequence, after the HA tag, the 12th codon is another ATG. So the initial HA tag is 11 codons, then another ATG. That would be correct if the HA tag was 11 codons, but the 12th codon is part of the GADD45G gene. So perhaps the HA tag is correctly inserted, but the additional ATG is causing a problem.

Let me think about the reading frame. The initial ATG is frame 1. The next 11 codons are part of the HA tag, then another ATG. So that's codon 12. Frame 1 continues, so that's another start codon.

But in the context of the cell, the ribosome will start at the first ATG, translate through all the codons, including the second ATG, unless there's a stop codon. If there's no stop codon in the HA tag part and the following GADD45G part, the ribosome should continue until the end of the GADD45G ORF.

Wait, but the construct may have a stop codon after the HA tag but before the GADD45G ORF, which would cause the ribosome to terminate early. Alternatively, perhaps the HA tag was inserted in a way that introduced a stop codon.

Wait, another possibility: the HA tag is correctly inserted, but the GADD45G sequence is in the wrong frame, leading to a stop codon somewhere. Let me see.

Looking at the given sequence, after the HA tag (codons 1-12), the next codons are ACT, CTG, GAA, GAA, GTC, etc.

ACT is Thr, CTG is Leu, GAA is Glu, GAA is Glu, GTC is Val. No stop codons.

So perhaps the problem isn't a stop codon in the HA region.

Looking at the options again, option C says the lack of a linker sequence is causing proteolysis. If the HA tag isn't followed by a linker, the protein might be recognized as foreign and degraded. But the question says that the protein isn't overexpressed, not that it's expressed but not detected. So perhaps the issue is that the HA tag's presence is causing the protein to be targeted for degradation because there's no linker. But I'm not sure if that's the main issue here.

Option D says the tRNA for the UAA codon doesn't exist in the mouse. But UAA is a stop codon, and all stop codons are recognized by release factors, not tRNAs. So this option is incorrect because stop codons don't require a tRNA; they signal termination.

Option A: The HA sequence has a missense mutation. That would change the amino acids, but unless it's a critical region, it might not prevent expression. However, if the HA insertion caused a frameshift leading to a premature stop codon, that could be an issue. But looking at the sequence, the HA seems to be correctly in frame.

Alternatively, perhaps the HA tag starts with ATG, but that's not the case here. The HA coding sequence starts with TAC (Y), so the initial ATG is correct.

Wait, another thought: maybe the HA tag was inserted into the wrong reading frame. Let's imagine that the HA tag was inserted into the GADD45G gene, but the insertion wasn't a multiple of three, causing a frameshift. For example, inserting 34 bases instead of 33 would shift the frame by one. But in this case, the sequence starts correctly with ATG, so perhaps that's not the issue.

Wait, another possible issue: the ATG is followed by a termination codon early on. Let me check the sequence again.

The first few codons after ATG are TAC, CCA, TAC, GAT, GTA, TCC, AGA, TTA, CGC, CAA, ATG, ACT, CTG, GAA, GAA, GTC, CGC, GCC, AGG, ACA, CAG, TTT, CGG, AAA, GCA, CAG, CCA, GGA, TGC, AGG, GTG, etc.

Looking for TGA, TAG, TAA. None of these in the initial part. The 12th codon is ATG (M), which is a start, but not a stop. So no early stop codons. So why isn't the protein expressed?

Wait, perhaps the issue is with the start codon itself. The initial ATG is correct, but perhaps the context around it is incorrect. For example, in eukaryotes, the start codon should be preceded by a Kozak sequence (in mammals), which is a specific nucleotide sequence around the start codon that facilitates recognition by the ribosome. If the plasmid doesn't have this Kozak sequence, the start codon might not be efficiently recognized, leading to low expression.

Looking at the sequence, the start codon is ATG, but what precedes it? The construct's beginning is 5' ATG..., so the upstream sequence might not have appropriate regulatory elements like a Kozak sequence. Without that, the ribosome might not efficiently initiate translation, leading to low or no expression of the protein.

But the options don't mention anything about the Kozak sequence. So perhaps the issue is elsewhere.

Another possibility: the HA tag is followed by a stop codon. For example, if the HA tag was inserted and then a stop codon was introduced, the protein would be truncated. But looking at the sequence, after the HA, the next codon is ACT (Thr), so no stop.

Wait, another thought: the HA tag might have a stop codon within it. Let's see. The HA sequence in the construct is TAC CCA TAC GAT GTA TCC AGA TTA CGC CAA ATG ACT... So the HA tag is TYPYDVPDY... and then it continues. No TGA or other stop codons in the HA part. So that's not it.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the HA tag is at the N-terminus, but the construct doesn't include a terminator codon after the HA, causing the ribosome to continue into the GADD45G sequence, but that's normal.

Wait, maybe the construct doesn't have a poly-A tail or other necessary elements for mRNA stability and expression. But the question says they transfected the plasmid into CHO cells, and the problem is that the protein isn't expressed. So perhaps the issue is with the coding sequence.

Looking again, the first codon is ATG, then the HA, but the 12th codon is another ATG. Could that cause the ribosome to terminate early? No, because the ribosome doesn't stop at another start codon unless it's in a different frame (which it's not here).

Wait, perhaps the second ATG is causing a frameshift elsewhere. Let me think: the initial HA is 11 codons, then the 12th codon is ATG. So the reading frame continues. So the GADD45G sequence starts correctly, but perhaps there's a stop codon downstream.

Wait, but the issue is that the GADD45G isn't being expressed. So perhaps the problem is that the HA tag is causing a premature stop codon. Let me check the entire sequence for any TGA, TAG, or TAA codons.

Looking through the sequence:

Looking at the entire sequence, after the initial HA and GADD45G sequences, I don't immediately see any TGA, TAG, or TAA codons. Let me scan for them.

Looking for TGA: anywhere in the sequence.

Looking at the triplets:

... CGC (R) CAA (Q) ATG (M) ACT (T) CTG (L) GAA (E) GAA (E) GTC (V) CGC (R) GCC (A) AGG (K) ACA (T) CAG (Q) TTT (F) CGG (R) AAA (K) GCA (A) CAG (Q) CCA (P) GGA (E) TGC (C) AGG (R) GTG (V) etc.

I don't see any TGA, TAG, or TAA codons in the first part. So perhaps the issue isn't a stop codon in the HA or early GADD45G.

Hmm, another possibility: the gene is not correctly inserted into the plasmid with the right orientation. If the construct is in the reverse orientation, the ATG would be at the 3' end, leading to no expression. But the given sequence starts with ATG, so it's in the correct orientation.

Wait, perhaps the problem is the presence of a cryptic promoter or another issue in the plasmid that's affecting transcription. But the question states that the antibiotic-resistant cell colonies were selected, implying that the plasmid was correctly taken up and expressed.

Another thought: perhaps the HA tag is causing the ribosome to terminate early because the tag is followed by a stop codon. But looking at the sequence, after the HA, it's the GADD45G coding sequence, so that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the HA tag's sequence is causing a frameshift. Let me check if the HA insertion was done correctly in a multiple of three. The HA is 11 amino acids, so 33 bases. So the first 33 bases after ATG should be the HA. Let's check the first 33 nucleotides:

The sequence after ATG is TAC CCA TAC GAT GTA TCC AGA TTA CGC CAA. That's 11 codons (33 bases). So the 12th codon is ATG, which is correct. So the HA insertion is correct, in frame.

Wait, so why isn't the protein being expressed? The options suggest that the problem is with the HA insertion or the presence of another start codon.

Option B suggests the ribosome terminated early. That would require a stop codon in the mRNA before the end of the ORF. But I don't see any in the initial part. Unless the GADD45G sequence itself contains a stop codon, but that's unlikely because it's a known gene.

Another possibility: the presence of the HA tag and the additional ATG is causing the ribosome to read beyond the intended stop codon. But that would lead to a longer protein, not a failure to express.

Wait, perhaps the second ATG is causing the ribosome to start a new reading frame, leading to a frameshift downstream. Let me think: the first ATG is at position 1, frame 1. The 12th codon is ATG in frame 1. If the ribosome continues, it would read the next codon as ACT (Thr), which is frame 1. But what if the ribosome started at the 12th codon's ATG, which is also frame 1? Then the reading frame would continue from there. Wait, but that would mean the same frame as before. So the presence of the second ATG doesn't change the frame.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Let me approach it differently. The problem is that the protein isn't overexpressed. So possible issues include no transcription, no translation, or the protein is made but quickly degraded.

The options suggest that the problem is within the construct. Let's reevaluate the options:

A) Missense mutation in HA determinant: would change the HA but not necessarily prevent expression.

B) Ribosome terminated early: implies a stop codon in the mRNA before the end.

C) No linker causing proteolysis: possible, but the protein might be present but not detected.

D) No tRNA for UAA: incorrect because stop codons don't use tRNA.

The initial sequence doesn't have a stop codon in the HA or early part. So perhaps the problem is that the HA tag introduces a stop codon in the mRNA, but I don't see it.

Wait, another possibility: the HA tag is in the correct frame, but the GADD45G sequence has a stop codon. But that's unlikely as GADD45G is a known gene.

Wait, maybe the HA tag is causing a frameshift elsewhere. Let's check the entire sequence for any in-frame stop codons.

Looking for TGA, TAG, or TAA codons:

The sequence is long. Let me scan through:

Looking for TGA: ... CGGAAAGCACAGCCAGGATGCAGGGTGCCGGGAAAGCGCTGCATGAGTTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA.

Looking for TGA: in the middle, I see ... TGAACGTGGAC ... So TGA is a codon here. TGA is a stop codon. So at position where the triplet is TGA.

Where is this located? Let me count.

Looking at the breakdown:

Looking for TGA in the triplets:

Looking for TGA in the sequence:

- TGA is present in the triplet TGAACGTGGAC as TGA (codon 53?), but wait, the triplet is TGA? Let me see:

The sequence ... GTC GGC GCA GCG TCA GGG CTG CCT CAC TGC C... Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me look for the exact triplet.

Looking at the sequence, the part where TGA is found is:

Looking for TGA as a triplet:

Looking for TGA in the sequence. The sequence includes TGAACGTGGAC... So the triplet would be TGA, ACG, TGG, etc. So yes, TGA is a stop codon here.

So where is this TGA located? Let's count the codons from the start.

2Okay, so I have this problem about a transgenic mouse model where someone is trying to overexpress the GADD45G protein. But they're having trouble getting the protein expressed as expected. Let me try to figure out what's going on here.

First, the setup: the researcher is using a plasmid to express the GADD45G gene modified with an influenza hemagglutinin tag at the N-terminus. They transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells and are selecting for antibiotic resistance. But when they test the expression, the protein isn't overexpressing as expected.

Looking at the sequence provided, which is the plus strand of the construct. I'm a bit rusty on my molecular biology, but let me think about possible issues.

The options are:

A) The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation.
B) The ribosome terminated the translation early.
C) The lack of the linker sequence is triggering proteolysis of the nascent chain.
D) The tRNA for the UAA codon does not exist in the mouse.

Hmm, let's break this down. The construct includes an HA tag at the N-terminus. So the HA sequence is probably inserted at the beginning of the coding sequence. I should check if the HA tag is correctly introduced or if there's a mutation in it. But wait, the problem states that the construct's sequence is given, and the issue is that the protein isn't overexpressed.

Wait, why would the protein not be expressed? Maybe the gene is not being properly translated. Let's look for possible stop codons or issues in the sequence.

Looking at the sequence, perhaps I should check for the presence of in-frame stop codons. The HA tag would be added before the start codon, but wait, the start codon is in the construct. Let me see.

Wait, the sequence starts with ATG, which is the start codon. So that's correct. But let's check for any early stop codons in the HA tag sequence. HA is a peptide from influenza, so its coding sequence would be before the GADD45G. Wait, but in the construct, the HA is at the N-terminus, so it's part of the reading frame. So the construct's coding sequence starts with HA, then GADD45G.

Wait, but the first part of the sequence is the HA tag. So let me see if the HA tag is correctly inserted. Let me think: the HA tag sequence is, say, YPYDVPDYA. So the DNA coding for that would be something like ATG TAC CCG ATC GAT GTT CCA... Maybe the initial part of the sequence is the HA tag. Looking at the given sequence:

The first part is 5'ATGTACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCCAAATGACTCTGGAAGAAGTCCGCGGCCAGGACACAGTTCCGGAAAGCACAGCCAGGATGCAGGGTGCCGGGAAAGCGCTGCATGAGTTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA3'

Wait, the sequence starts with ATG TAC CCC ATA CGA TGT TCC AGA TTA CGC CAA ATG ACT CTG GAA GAA GTC CGC... So ATG is the start, then TAC is Tyr, then CCC is Pro, then ATA is Ile, then CGA is Arg, etc. Wait, so the HA tag is perhaps the first few codons. So HA is YPYDVPDYA. Let's see:

YP is Tyr-Pro: the DNA would be TAC CCC.

Then Y is Tyr (TAC), D is Asp (GAT or CAT?), but wait, in the forward strand, the codons are read as per the mRNA. Wait, no, the DNA is in the 5' to 3' direction, so the mRNA would be complementary to the template strand. Wait, no: the given sequence is the plus (coding) strand, so the mRNA would be complementary. Wait no, wait, the coding strand is the same as the mRNA except T for U. So the DNA is the coding strand, so the mRNA would be sequence same as the coding DNA, except U instead of T.

So the HA tag is inserted before the GADD45G. So in the construct, the HA tag is part of the ORF.

But the problem is that the protein isn't overexpressed. Let me think about possible reasons.

Looking at the end of the sequence, 'TGA' is a stop codon. Let me check if the sequence ends with a stop codon. The last part is ...GAGTGA. So TGA is a stop codon. Wait, but in the given sequence, the last letters are TGA, which is a stop codon. But wait, the sequence ends with TGA as the last three nucleotides? Let me check.

The full sequence: ...CGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA3'

Wait, the last part is ...GAGTGA3', so the last codon is TGA. So the sequence terminates with TGA, which is a stop codon.

Oh wait! So the construct ends with TGA, meaning that the translation would terminate early. Hmm, but wait, the construct is supposed to express the HA-GADD45G fusion. But if the construct has a stop codon in the middle, that would terminate translation early.

Wait, but is the TGA at the very end the stop codon for the entire ORF, or is it in the middle?

Looking at the sequence from the beginning: starts with ATG, and ends with TGA. So the entire ORF is from ATG to TGA. So the construct is introducing a stop codon at the end, which is correct.

Wait, but in that case, the HA tag and GADD45G would be expressed as a fusion protein, ending at the TGA. So why isn't the protein being expressed?

Wait, perhaps the HA tag introduces a premature stop codon. Let me think: maybe the HA tag's sequence has a stop codon, causing the ribosome to terminate before the GADD45G is fully translated.

Wait, let me look at the first part of the sequence again. The HA tag is probably the initial part. Let's see the first few codons:

ATG TAC CCC ATA CGA TGT TCC AGA TTA CGC CAA ATG ACT CTG GAA GAA GTC CGC ...

So ATG (start), TAC (Y), CCC (P), ATA (I), CGA (R), TGT (C), TCC (S), AGA (R), TTA (L), CGC (R), CAA (Q), ATG (start), ACT (T), CTG (L), etc.

Wait, that seems a bit odd. Wait, after the initial ATG start, the next codon is TAC (Y), then CCC (P), so YP. Then comes ATA (I), so YPI. Then CGA (R), so YPIR. Hmm, that's not the HA tag sequence I know. Oh wait, maybe I'm getting it wrong.

Wait, HA tag is usually YPYDVPDYA. So the amino acid sequence is Y P Y D V P D Y A. Let's see the corresponding codons.

Y is TAC, P is CCA or CCG, Y is TAC, D is GAT, V is GTT, P is CCA, D is GAT, Y is TAC, A is GCT or GCA.

So the HA tag coding sequence would be TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TCA or something like that. Wait, perhaps in the given construct, the HA sequence may have a wrong codon, introducing a stop early.

Looking at the construct's DNA sequence, the first part is ATG TAC CCC ATA CGA TGT TCC AGA TTA CGC CAA ATG ACT CTG GAA GAA GTC CGC...

So the first codon is ATG (start), next is TAC (Y), then CCC (P), then ATA (I), CGA (R), TGT (C), TCC (S), AGA (R), TTA (L), CGC (R), CAA (Q), ATG (start again?).

Wait a minute, that's a problem. Because after the initial ATG (start), the next codon is TAC (Y), then CCC (P), etc. But after some codons, another ATG appears. So that would be a new start codon, which would cause the ribosome to start translating again, but if the reading frame is correct, it's part of the same ORF. But perhaps that ATG (start codon) is in the same frame, so it's part of the same protein.

Wait, but in this case, the initial part is ATG TAC CCC ATA CGA TGT TCC AGA TTA CGC CAA ATG ACT CTG GAA GAA GTC CGC...

So after the initial ATG, the 20th codon is ATG again. So that would be a second start codon in the same ORF. But that's not the issue. The issue is that the sequence has a stop codon in the middle, but in the given sequence, the last codon is TGA, so it's the end.

Wait, but the problem is that the protein isn't overexpressed. Let me think about the possible options.

Option B: The ribosome terminated the translation early. That would happen if there's a stop codon upstream in the sequence. Let me check the sequence for any TAA, TAG, or TGA codons before the end.

Looking through the sequence:

After the initial part, I see CGA (R), TGT (C), TCC (S), AGA (R), TTA (L), CGC (R), CAA (Q), ATG (start again?), ACT (T), CTG (L), GAA (E), GAA (E), GTC (V), CGC (R), etc. Hmm, I don't immediately see another stop codon, but wait, looking further.

Wait, looking for TGA in the middle. Let me scan the sequence for TGA triplets.

Looking at the sequence:

Looking for TGA in the DNA, which is complementary to ACT in the mRNA. So in the coding strand, TGA is a stop codon.

Looking through the sequence:

The middle part: ...GAAGAAGTCCGCGGCCAGGACACAGTTCCGGAAAGCACAGCCAGGATGCAGGGTGCCGGGAAAGCGCTGCATGAGTTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA...

Wait, I see 'TGA' in the middle: looking for the triplet TGA. Let me see:

Looking at the part: ...GAGTCTTGAACGTGGAC... So TGA is in the middle. So the sequence has a TGA triplet in the middle, which is a stop codon. So that would cause the translation to stop there, producing a truncated protein. Oh, that's a problem.

So the construct has an internal TGA stop codon, which would cause the ribosome to terminate early, resulting in a truncated protein that's probably nonfunctional. So the researcher isn't getting the full-length HA-GADD45G protein, which explains why overexpression isn't happening as expected.

So looking at the options, option B says the ribosome terminated the translation early. That's likely due to an internal stop codon in the construct.

Wait, but let me think again. The presence of TGA in the middle would cause the ribosome to stop, making a shorter protein. So why is the protein not overexpressed? Because it's being made but is shorter, so maybe it's unstable or not detected, or perhaps the construct is not being properly expressed because the gene is truncated.

So the reason is that there's a TGA (stop codon) in the middle of the coding sequence, causing early termination. So option B is correct.

Alternatively, option D says the tRNA for UAA doesn't exist. Wait, in the mRNA, a stop codon is UAA, UAG, or UGA. The DNA coding for UGA would be TGA. So if the mRNA has a UGA, the cell needs a release factor that recognizes it. But all stop codons are read by the same release factors, so the presence of UGA in the mRNA should be recognized, regardless of the tRNA availability. So option D is less likely.

Option C says the lack of a linker triggers proteolysis. Without a linker, maybe the HA tag is causing the protein to be recognized for degradation. But the question states that the issue is in the sequence, not in the detection. The problem is that the protein isn't expressed as expected, possibly due to a stop codon.

So the most likely answer is B: the ribosome terminated the translation early because there's an internal stop codon in the construct.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves a transgenic mouse model where the researcher is attempting to overexpress the GADD45G protein fused with an influenza hemagglutinin (HA) tag at the N-terminus. However, the protein is not being expressed as expected. The provided DNA sequence of the construct is analyzed to identify the issue.

The sequence starts with the canonical start codon `ATG` and includes the coding sequence for the HA tag and GADD45G. Upon inspection, an internal stop codon `TGA` is found in the middle of the sequence. This stop codon would cause the ribosome to terminate translation prematurely, resulting in the production of a truncated protein. This explains why the full-length HA-GADD45G protein is not being overexpressed.

### Analysis of the Options:
- **A) The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation:**  
  While a mutation in the HA tag could theoretically cause issues, there is no evidence in the sequence provided to suggest a missense mutation. The problem lies downstream with a stop codon, not the HA tag itself.

- **B) The ribosome terminated the translation early:**  
  This is correct. The presence of the internal `TGA` stop codon in the sequence causes the ribosome to terminate translation prematurely, leading to the production of a truncated protein instead of the full-length HA-GADD45G.

- **C) The lack of the linker sequence is triggering proteolysis of the nascent chain:**  
  While a linker sequence might influence protein stability or detection, the primary issue here is the premature termination of translation due to the internal stop codon, not proteolysis.

- **D) The tRNA for the UAA codon does not exist in the mouse:**  
  This is incorrect. All stop codons (UAA, UAG, UGA) are recognized by universal release factors, and the absence of specific tRNA does not affect stop codon recognition.

The most likely cause of the issue is the premature termination of translation due to the internal `TGA` stop codon in the construct.

**Answer: B**
