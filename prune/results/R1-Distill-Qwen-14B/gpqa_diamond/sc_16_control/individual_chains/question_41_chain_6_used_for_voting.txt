Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. I remember from my classes that this involves the index of refraction and maybe some relativity concepts.

Alright, let's read the question again. A light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in the lab. We need to find the speed of light relative to the observer. Oh, and c is 1 because we're taking the speed of light in a vacuum as 1.

Wait, so the glass is moving in the same direction as the light beam, but towards the observer. That's a bit confusing. Wait, if the beam is moving towards the observer and the glass is moving in the same direction, that might mean that the glass is moving toward the observer as well, but the beam is going the same way. Or maybe I misread. Let me clarify: the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer. Wait, no, that can't be right. If the beam is moving toward the observer, and the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam (so same as the beam's direction), but the glass is also moving toward the observer. Hmm, maybe I should think of it differently. Oh wait, perhaps the glass is moving towards the observer, but the light beam is moving in the same direction as the glass's velocity. So the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is moving in that same direction.

Wait, maybe the setup is similar to the classic case where you have a medium moving relative to the observer. I remember that when a medium moves, the speed of light in that medium as measured by an observer can be affected by the motion of the medium. But I'm a bit hazy on the exact formula.

So, the speed of light in a medium is usually v = c/n. But that's when the medium is at rest relative to the observer. But when the medium is moving, how does that change things?

I think this has to do with the Doppler effect or perhaps the relativistic velocity addition formula. Wait, because the glass is moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light, maybe we need to consider relativistic effects here.

Wait, but the problem says the glass is moving at a constant velocity v, which might imply that v is much smaller than c. Or maybe not. The options don't show any terms with v squared, so perhaps a non-relativistic approach is intended?

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simpler. The speed of light in the glass is c/n in the medium's rest frame. But when the medium is moving, how does that affect the observed speed?

Wait, in the rest frame of the glass, the light is moving at c/n. But from the lab frame, where the glass is moving, how do we transform the velocity?

This sounds like a case for the velocity addition formula from special relativity. Oh right, the formula is u' = (u + v)/(1 + (u*v)/c²). But wait, I'm not sure if that's the right approach here. Because the light is inside the glass, which is a medium. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: the speed of light in the medium is v = c/n. But if the medium is moving, the observer would see the light moving at a different speed. So perhaps we need to use a Doppler shift or velocity addition.

Wait, let's think about the problem in terms of frames. The glass is moving with velocity v relative to the lab. Inside the glass, the light is moving at c/n. But what does the lab observer see?

Wait, maybe the light's velocity in the lab frame is different. So perhaps using the relativistic velocity addition formula.

Wait, but in the glass's frame, the light is moving at v = c/n in the same direction as the glass's motion. So from the lab frame, which is moving at velocity v relative to the glass, the observed speed would be u' = (v + V)/(1 + (v V)/c²), where V is the speed of the glass relative to the lab (so V is v). Wait, but wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, in the glass frame, the light is moving at v = c/n in the same direction as the glass's velocity as seen from the lab. So, if the glass is moving at velocity V (which is v, the given velocity), then we can apply the velocity addition formula to find the speed in the lab frame.

Wait, no. Wait, the lab is the rest frame. The glass is moving with velocity v (same direction as the light) towards the observer. The light is moving in the same direction as the glass's motion. So in the glass's frame, the light's speed is c/n. We need to find the speed in the lab frame.

Wait, the velocity addition formula is:

u' = (u + v) / (1 + (u v)/(c^2))

Where u is the velocity in the glass frame, and u' is the velocity in the lab frame, where the glass is moving at velocity v.

Wait, but wait, the glass is moving at velocity v in the lab frame. So, in the glass's frame, it's stationary, and the lab is moving at -v. So, if in the glass frame, the light is moving at u = c/n in the same direction as the glass's velocity in the lab, then in the lab frame, the speed u' would be (u + v)/(1 + (u v)/c²).

Wait, that's the standard formula for relativistic velocity addition. Since the light is moving in the same direction as the glass's motion, both u and v are positive.

So, substituting u = c/n, and the speed of light c is 1. So u = 1/n.

So, u' = (1/n + v) / (1 + ( (1/n) * v ) )

Wait, but let me check: denominator is 1 + (u v)/c². Since c is 1, it's 1 + (u v). So:

u' = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + (1/n)*v )

Hmm, let's factor out 1/n from numerator and denominator.

Numerator: (1 + n v)/n

Denominator: (n + v)/n )

So when you divide them, the n's cancel. So u' = (1 + n v)/(n + v).

Wait, that gives us (1 + n v)/(n + v), which is option A.

But wait, none of the other options match this. Let me check the options again.

Option A is (1 + n v)/(n + v). That's what I got. So the answer would be A.

Wait, but wait. Could there be a mistake in the direction? Let's make sure. The glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is moving in the same direction as the glass. So in the lab frame, the light is moving faster than it would in the glass's rest frame. So the speed should be higher than c/n, but wait, since c is 1, and v is positive, the numerator (1 + n v) divided by (n + v) ... let me plug in some numbers to check.

Suppose n=1. Then, u' = (1 + v)/(1 + v) = 1, which makes sense. Because the glass is moving at v, and the light in glass is 1 (since n=1, so c/n is 1). So from the lab frame, the speed is 1. Which is correct, because if the glass is moving at v, and the light is moving at 1 in the glass's frame, then from lab frame, using relativistic addition, the speed is (1 + v)/(1 + v) = 1, which is correct.

Another test: if v is zero, the speed is (1 +0)/ (n +0 ) = 1/n, which is correct.

So the formula seems to work in the test cases.

Looking back, option A is (1 +n v)/(n +v), which matches our result.

So the answer should be option A.

To determine the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory, we analyze the situation using relativistic velocity addition. The light beam propagates through the glass, which has an index of refraction \( n \), and the glass is moving at a constant velocity \( v \) in the same direction as the light beam and toward the observer.

In the rest frame of the glass, the speed of light is \( v_{\text{glass}} = \frac{c}{n} \), where \( c = 1 \) (the speed of light in a vacuum). From the laboratory frame, where the glass is moving at velocity \( v \), the observed speed of light \( u' \) can be calculated using the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
u' = \frac{u + v}{1 + \frac{u v}{c^2}}
\]

Here:
- \( u = \frac{c}{n} = \frac{1}{n} \) (speed of light in the glass's rest frame),
- \( v \) is the velocity of the glass relative to the laboratory.

Substituting \( u = \frac{1}{n} \) and \( c = 1 \), the formula becomes:

\[
u' = \frac{\frac{1}{n} + v}{1 + \frac{1}{n} v}
\]

To simplify, factor out \( \frac{1}{n} \) from the numerator and denominator:

\[
u' = \frac{\frac{1 + n v}{n}}{\frac{n + v}{n}} = \frac{1 + n v}{n + v}
\]

Thus, the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory is:

\[
u' = \frac{1 + n v}{n + v}
\]

This matches option **A**. Testing special cases confirms the result:
1. If \( n = 1 \), \( u' = \frac{1 + v}{1 + v} = 1 \), which is consistent with the speed of light in a vacuum.
2. If \( v = 0 \), \( u' = \frac{1}{n} \), which is the speed of light in the glass's rest frame.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: A**
