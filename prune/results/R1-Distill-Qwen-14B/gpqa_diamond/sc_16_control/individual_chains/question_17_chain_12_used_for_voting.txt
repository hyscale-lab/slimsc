Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, let's see.

The problem says that the solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Oh wait, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, right? It forms complexes with metal ions. So Ca-EDTA would be a complex ion, probably something like CaY^2- where Y is the EDTA part.

The given K for Ca-EDTA is 5x10^10. Wait, K here must be the formation constant, Kf. Because formation constants are the equilibrium constants for the formation of the complex. So the reaction would be Ca^2+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2- and Kf is [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca^2+][EDTA^4-]).

But wait, the problem says the solution is 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. So that means the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. And we're to find the concentration of free calcium ions in solution.

So, the complex dissociates into Ca^2+ and EDTA^4-. But because Kf is very large (5e10), the complex should be very stable, meaning it won't dissociate much. So the concentration of free Ca^2+ should be really low.

Let me set up the equation. Let's denote the concentration of Ca^2+ as x. Then, since the complex dissociates into one Ca^2+ and one EDTA^4-, the concentration of EDTA^4- would also be x. Because for every mole of complex that dissociates, you get a mole each of Ca^2+ and EDTA^4-.

But wait, the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, so if some dissociates, the complex's concentration would be 0.02 - x. But x is probably really small compared to 0.02, because Kf is huge. So maybe I can approximate 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02. That would simplify the calculations.

So the formation constant expression is Kf = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca^2+][EDTA^4-]) = 5e10. Substituting what we have:

5e10 = 0.02 / (x * x) → 5e10 = 0.02 / x².

Solving for x². Let me rearrange that: x² = 0.02 / (5e10). Let's compute that. 0.02 is 2e-2, so 2e-2 / 5e10 = (2/5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13. Wait, wait, 0.02 is 2e-2. So 2e-2 divided by 5e10 is (2/5) * 1e-12. 2/5 is 0.4, so 0.4e-12 is 4e-13? No, wait, 0.4e-12 is 4e-13? No, wait, 0.4e-12 is 4e-13 is correct because 0.4e-12 is the same as 4 * 10^-13.

So x² = 4e-13. Taking the square root of both sides gives x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, sqrt(4) is 2, sqrt(1e-13) is 1e-6.5, which is 3.16e-7. Wait, no, wait. Let me compute sqrt(4e-13). 4e-13 is 4 * 1e-13. The square root of 4 is 2, the square root of 1e-13 is 1e-6.5. So 2 * 1e-6.5. 1e-6.5 is approximately 3.16e-7. So 2 *3.16e-7 is about 6.32e-7 M.

Looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M. So the answer must be C.

Wait, let me double-check. If the complex is 0.02 M, and Kf is 5e10, which is a huge number, so the extent of dissociation is very small. So the assumption that 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02 is valid here. So the calculation should be correct. So the concentration of calcium ions is about 6.3e-7 M, which is option C.

To determine the concentration of calcium ions (\([Ca^{2+}]\)) in a solution containing 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex, we use the formation constant (\(K_f\)) of the complex, which is \(5 \times 10^{10}\). The dissociation of the complex can be represented as:

\[
\text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{4-} \leftrightarrow \text{CaEDTA}^{2-}
\]

The equilibrium expression for \(K_f\) is:

\[
K_f = \frac{[\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]}{[Ca^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}
\]

Given that the concentration of the complex \([\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]\) is 0.02 M, and assuming the dissociation is minimal (due to the large \(K_f\)), we approximate \([\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}] \approx 0.02\). Let the concentration of free \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\) and \(\text{EDTA}^{4-}\) be \(x\). Substituting into the equilibrium expression:

\[
K_f = \frac{0.02}{x^2}
\]

Rearranging for \(x^2\):

\[
x^2 = \frac{0.02}{K_f} = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}} = \frac{2 \times 10^{-2}}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} = 2 \times 3.16 \times 10^{-7} = 6.32 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, the concentration of free \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\) is approximately \(6.3 \times 10^{-7}\) M, which corresponds to option C.
