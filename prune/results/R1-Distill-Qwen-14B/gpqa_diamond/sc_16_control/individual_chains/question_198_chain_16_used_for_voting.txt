Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

So, we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-). The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the [SCN-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants for the Co(II) thiocyanato complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. The question is asking what percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes (which I'm guessing is the Co(SCN)_2 complex, maybe [Co(SCN)_2]?) are present among all cobalt-containing species.

Wait, the options are percentages, so I need to calculate the fraction of the cobalt that's in the [Co(SCN)_2] form.

Hmm, okay, so I remember that the stability constant (β) for a complex tells us how stable it is. The higher the β, the more the complex will form. The general formula for the complexes would be Co(SCN)_n, where n is the number of SCN- ligands attached. So each βn is the formation constant for that complex.

Wait, but the β's are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So for each n, the complex is [Co(SCN)_n]^{2-n} because Co is +2 and each SCN is -, so charge would be 2 - n.

But wait, the problem mentions the dithiocyanato complexes, which would be n=2. So we're looking for [Co(SCN)_2]^0, which is a neutral complex. And the question is about the percentage of this form relative to all possible Co species.

But wait, to find the percentage, I think I need to use the formation constants and the concentrations of the ligand and the metal ions to calculate the distribution of each complex.

So the general approach is to calculate the fraction of Co in each complex (from n=0 to n=4) and then find the fraction that is in the n=2 form.

But wait, the solution is only considering Co(II) and SCN- ions. So, the total cobalt concentration is the sum of all possible Co species: Co^2+, [Co(SCN)]^+, [Co(SCN)_2]^0, [Co(SCN)_3]^- , [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-}.

Each of these complexes has a certain stability constant. The fraction of each complex can be found using the stability constants and the concentrations of the ligand and metal.

Wait, but in the solution, the Co is in various complexes, and the total concentration is fixed. So the sum of all the Co species will be 1e-2 M.

But the approach I think is to model the distribution of Co species using the formation constants and the concentrations of SCN- and Co^2+.

Wait, but SCN- is 0.1 M, which is much higher than the Co concentration. So the ligand is in excess, which might mean that the complexes are more likely to form. But I'm not sure how that affects the calculation.

Let me think about the formula for the distribution of each complex.

The fraction of Co in the nth complex is given by (βn * [SCN-]^n) / (1 + sum_{k=0 to 4} βk [SCN-]^k )

Wait, no, I think the general expression for the fraction of Co in the nth complex is (βn [SCN]^n) / (sum_{k=0}^4 βk [SCN]^k )

Wait, no, wait. Let's consider that the formation of the complex [Co(SCN)_n] can be represented as:

Co^2+ + n SCN^- ↔ [Co(SCN)_n]^{2-n}, with Kf = βn.

But in solution, the various complexes are in equilibrium. So the fraction of Co in each complex is given by:

fn = (βn [SCN]^n) / ( sum_{k=0}^4 βk [SCN]^k )

Wait, but wait, the 'sum' would be the sum of all the possible βk [SCN]^k terms for each k. And that sum is the denominator for each fraction.

Wait, but we have to consider that for each complex, the concentration is [Co][SCN]^n * βn. So the total is the sum over all n of [Co][SCN]^n * βn, but the [Co] is the same for each term because it's the same metal. So the sum is [Co] * sum_{k=0}^4 βk [SCN]^k = [Co] * S, where S is the sum. So each fraction is [Co][SCN]^n βn / ([Co] S) )= (βn [SCN]^n ) / S.

So the fraction for each complex is (βn [SCN]^n ) / (sum_{k=0}^4 βk [SCN]^k )

So in this case, the question is about n=2, the dithiocyanato complex, which I think is [Co(SCN)_2]^0.

So I need to calculate the sum S = β0 [SCN]^0 + β1 [SCN]^1 + β2 [SCN]^2 + β3 [SCN]^3 + β4 [SCN]^4.

Wait, but wait, what is β0? Oh, wait, β0 is the formation constant for the complex with zero SCN- ligands, which is just Co^2+ itself. So β0 is 1 because the complex is the same as the free ion. Wait, no, the formation constant for the zero complex is 1, yes. Because [Co^2+ ] = [Co][SCN]^0 * β0; so β0 is 1.

Wait, but I just realized that the given β's are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So I think β0 is 1, as the formation constant for Co^2+ is 1.

So S = β0 * [SCN]^0 + β1 * [SCN]^1 + β2 * [SCN]^2 + β3 * [SCN]^3 + β4 * [SCN]^4.

Plugging in the values:

β0 =1, [SCN]=0.1 M.

So compute each term:

β0 [SCN]^0 = 1 * (0.1)^0 = 1 * 1 = 1.

β1 [SCN]^1 = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9.

β2 [SCN]^2 = 40 * (0.1)^2 = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4.

β3 [SCN]^3 = 63 * (0.1)^3 = 63 * 0.001 = 0.063.

β4 [SCN]^4 = 16 * (0.1)^4 =16 * 0.0001 = 0.0016.

Now sum all these terms:

1 + 0.9 = 1.9. Then +0.4 → 2.3. +0.063 → 2.363. +0.0016 → 2.3646.

So S ≈ 2.3646.

Now, the fraction for n=2 is (β2 [SCN]^2 ) / S.

So that's (0.4) / 2.3646 ≈ 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.1692, or about 16.92%.

Wait, but the options are A) 42.3%, B)25.6%, C)38.1%, D)16.9%.

So that would be option D.

Wait, but wait a second. The problem is about the dithiocyanato complex, which I thought was [Co(SCN)_2]^0. But wait, I thought that the blue color is associated with the [Co(SCN)_2]^0 complex, but sometimes the [Co(SCN)_3]^− is also blue? Or maybe I'm mixing things up. Wait, no, in the case of Co(II), the [Co(SCN)_4]^2− is the one that's usually blue. Wait, but wait, the common blue complex is [Co(SCN)_4]^2−, which is the tetra complex. So perhaps the problem is referring to another complex?

Wait, the question says "blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes". Hmm, wait, dithiocyanato would be two SCN ligands, so [Co(SCN)_2]^0. But I thought that the tetra complex is blue. So perhaps I made a mistake in identifying which complex is blue.

Wait, maybe the question is referring to the tetra complex as the blue one. Because in the options, the percentage I calculated (16.9%) is option D, but the question is about the blue complex.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that I'm miscalculating which complex is the blue one. Let me think about the colors.

Alternatively, maybe the question is correct, and the dithiocyanato complex is the blue one. Alternatively, perhaps the tetra complex is blue, but the question is not about that.

Wait, perhaps I should read the problem again. The question says: "the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt containing species".

So 'dithiocyanato' implies two SCN- ligands, so [Co(SCN)_2]^0. So perhaps the blue color is for that complex.

Alternatively, I could have made an error in the calculation of the fraction. Let me double-check.

Wait, the sum S was 1 +0.9 +0.4 +0.063 +0.0016 = 2.3646.

So the fraction for n=2 is (40 * (0.1)^2 ) / 2.3646 → 40 * 0.01 = 0.4. 0.4 / 2.3646 = approx 0.1692 (16.92%). So the answer would be D.

But wait, the options list D as 16.9%, which matches this.

So the percentage is 16.9%, so the answer is D.

To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes ([Co(SCN)₂]⁰) among all cobalt-containing species in the solution, we use the stability constants (β) and the given concentrations of Co²⁺ and SCN⁻. The total cobalt concentration is 10⁻² M, and [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M. The stability constants are β₀ = 1, β₁ = 9, β₂ = 40, β₃ = 63, and β₄ = 16.

The fraction of cobalt in the nth complex is given by:

\[
f_n = \frac{\beta_n [\text{SCN}]^n}{\sum_{k=0}^4 \beta_k [\text{SCN}]^k}
\]

Here, we are interested in the fraction of cobalt in the dithiocyanato complex ([Co(SCN)₂]⁰), which corresponds to \( n = 2 \). First, calculate the sum \( S = \sum_{k=0}^4 \beta_k [\text{SCN}]^k \):

\[
\begin{align*}
\beta_0 [\text{SCN}]^0 &= 1 \cdot (0.1)^0 = 1, \\
\beta_1 [\text{SCN}]^1 &= 9 \cdot (0.1)^1 = 0.9, \\
\beta_2 [\text{SCN}]^2 &= 40 \cdot (0.1)^2 = 0.4, \\
\beta_3 [\text{SCN}]^3 &= 63 \cdot (0.1)^3 = 0.063, \\
\beta_4 [\text{SCN}]^4 &= 16 \cdot (0.1)^4 = 0.0016.
\end{align*}
\]

Summing these terms:

\[
S = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646.
\]

Now, calculate the fraction of cobalt in the [Co(SCN)₂]⁰ complex:

\[
f_2 = \frac{\beta_2 [\text{SCN}]^2}{S} = \frac{0.4}{2.3646} \approx 0.1692.
\]

This corresponds to approximately 16.92% of the cobalt species being in the [Co(SCN)₂]⁰ form. Comparing this result with the provided options, the closest match is **16.9%**, which corresponds to option D.
