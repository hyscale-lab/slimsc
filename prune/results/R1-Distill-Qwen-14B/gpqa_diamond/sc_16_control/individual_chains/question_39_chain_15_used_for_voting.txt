Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

So, the setup is that there are 10,000 identical systems, each with a particle in the same conditions. Each particle can move along a tube, which is along the x-axis. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i, where i is the square root of -1. But when they measured the position of the particles, none were found outside the region x=1 to x=3. Hmm, but wait, the wave function as given has an imaginary component, which is a bit confusing because I thought the wave function needs to be normalized and typically the probability density is the square of the absolute value.

Wait, right. The wave function needs to be normalized. The integral of the absolute square of the wave function over all space should equal 1. So that's the normalization condition.

But wait, in this case, the wave function is given as (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Let me write that down as ψ(x) = [a/(sqrt(1+x))] - (0.5)i.

So the wave function is a complex function. To find the probability, I need to compute |ψ(x)|², which is ψ*(x) multiplied by ψ(x), where * denotes the complex conjugate.

So ψ*(x) would be [a/(sqrt(1+x))] + 0.5i.

Multiplying ψ and ψ*, the cross terms (the imaginary parts) would involve i and -i. Let me compute that:

ψψ* = [a/(sqrt(1+x))]^2 + (a/(sqrt(1+x)))(0.5i) + (a/(sqrt(1+x)))(-0.5i) + (0.5i)(-0.5i).

Simplify each term:

First term: [a²/(1+x)].

Second term: (a * 0.5i)/(sqrt(1+x)).

Third term: (-a * 0.5i)/(sqrt(1+x)).

Fourth term: (-0.25 i^2) → since i^2=-1, this becomes +0.25.

The second and third terms are each other's negatives, so they cancel out. So overall, ψψ* = [a²/(1+x)] + 0.25.

Wait, so the probability density at any x is (a²/(1+x)) + 0.25.

But wait, the problem states that when measuring the position, none were found outside x=1 and x=3. That means the wave function must be zero outside this interval. Oh wait, but wait, the wave function given is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Hmm, but that's not zero outside x=1 to 3. So perhaps the wave function is zero outside that region, but the given expression is valid only between x=1 and x=3. Or maybe the given function is part of a larger function that's zero elsewhere, but the question only tells us about this part.

Wait, but the question says "the part of space where it can exist" is described by this function. So perhaps that part is from x=1 to x=3, and elsewhere the wave function is zero.

But wait, the given wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i. So the real part is a/sqrt(1+x), and the imaginary part is -0.5. Wait, but wait, that doesn't make sense for an eigenstate. Because in eigenstates of position, the wave function is non-zero everywhere, but perhaps in this problem, the particle is confined between x=1 and x=3, and the wave function is zero elsewhere.

Wait, but if that's the case, then the wave function must be zero outside x=1 to x=3. So the given function is valid only between 1 and 3, and zero otherwise.

Wait, but the given function is ψ(x) = (a/sqrt(1+x)) − 0.5i. So this is a complex function. Wait, but that's a problem because the wave function must be zero outside the region. So perhaps the entire wave function is zero except between x=1 and x=3, where it's given by this expression.

So to normalize, the integral from x=1 to x=3 of |ψ(x)|² dx must equal 1.

Wait, but earlier I found |ψ(x)|² = (a²/(1+x)) + 0.25. So integrating this from 1 to 3 should be 1.

So the integral becomes ∫[1 to 3] (a²/(1+x) + 0.25) dx = 1.

Let me compute this integral step by step.

First, split the integral into two parts:

Integral of a²/(1+x) dx from 1 to3 plus integral of 0.25 dx from 1 to3.

Compute each part.

Integral of a²/(1+x) dx is a² * ln(1+x) evaluated from 1 to3.

So a² [ln(4) - ln(2)] = a² ln(2).

Because ln(4) is ln(2^2) = 2 ln2, and ln2 - ln2/2? Wait no, wait:

Wait, ln(4) is 2 ln2, and ln(2) is 1 ln2. So the difference is 2 ln2 - ln2 = ln2. So the first integral is a² * ln2.

Second integral: 0.25*(3−1) = 0.25*2 = 0.5.

So the entire integral is a² ln2 + 0.5 = 1.

So a² ln2 = 1 − 0.5 = 0.5 → a² = 0.5 / ln2.

Compute ln2: approximately 0.6931.

So 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213 → a² ≈ 0.7213 → a ≈ sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849, which is approximately 0.85.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.85.

So the answer should be B.

To solve the problem, we start by noting that the wave function is given as:

\[
\psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i
\]

The probability density is the square of the absolute value of the wave function:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \psi^*(x) \psi(x)
\]

The complex conjugate of \(\psi(x)\) is:

\[
\psi^*(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} + 0.5i
\]

Multiplying \(\psi(x)\) and \(\psi^*(x)\), we get:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + \left(0.5\right)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25
\]

The wave function is zero outside the region \(x = 1\) to \(x = 3\), so the normalization condition requires:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} |\psi(x)|^2 dx = 1
\]

Substituting \(|\psi(x)|^2\), the integral becomes:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1
\]

This can be split into two parts:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} \frac{a^2}{1+x} dx + \int_{1}^{3} 0.25 dx = 1
\]

1. **First integral**:  
\[
\int_{1}^{3} \frac{a^2}{1+x} dx = a^2 \ln(1+x) \Big|_{1}^{3} = a^2 \left[\ln(4) - \ln(2)\right] = a^2 \ln(2)
\]

2. **Second integral**:  
\[
\int_{1}^{3} 0.25 dx = 0.25 \cdot (3 - 1) = 0.5
\]

Adding these results:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1
\]

Solving for \(a^2\):

\[
a^2 \ln(2) = 0.5 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}
\]

Using \(\ln(2) \approx 0.6931\):

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7213 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a \approx \sqrt{0.7213} \approx 0.85
\]

Thus, the value of \(a\) is approximately \(0.85\), which corresponds to option **B**.
