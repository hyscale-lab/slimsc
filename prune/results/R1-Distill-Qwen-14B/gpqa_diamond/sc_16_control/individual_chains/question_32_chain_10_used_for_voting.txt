Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about calculating the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) when a nucleus is moving at 0.96c. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my relativity, but let's try to think this through step by step.

First, the problem says the nucleus is X, which is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium. So normally, lithium has 3 protons. If it has 3 neutrons, that makes it lithium-6, right? Because 3 protons + 3 neutrons = 6 nucleons. So the mass number A is 6. So the nucleus is Li-6.

Next, the question is about finding the energy of the RHIC so that the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96 times the speed of light (c). So we're dealing with relativistic speeds here. I remember that for particles moving at speeds close to c, we can't use classical mechanics; we need to use special relativity.

The energy in question here is probably the total relativistic energy of the nucleus. The formula for relativistic energy is E = gamma * m0 * c², where gamma is the Lorentz factor, m0 is the rest mass, and c is the speed of light.

So, I need to find gamma first. Gamma is 1 divided by the square root of (1 minus (v²/c²)). Let's plug in v=0.96c. Then v²/c² is (0.96)^2, which is 0.9216. So 1 minus that is 0.0784. The square root of that is sqrt(0.0784). Hmm, what's the square root of 0.0784? Let's see, 0.28^2 is 0.0784, right? Because 0.28 times 0.28 is 0.0784. So sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28.

So gamma is 1 / 0.28. Let me calculate that. 1 divided by 0.28 is approximately 3.5714. Wait, let me check that calculation. 0.28 times 3.5714 is 0.28 * 3.5714. Let's see: 0.28 *3 is 0.84, 0.28*0.5714 is about 0.16. So 0.84+0.16=1. So yeah, 3.5714.

So gamma is approximately 3.5714. But wait, maybe I should be more precise. Let me calculate 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) exactly.

Wait, (0.96)^2 is 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28 exactly because 0.28²=0.0784. So gamma is 1/0.28 = 3.57142857 approximately.

So now I need the rest mass of the lithium-6 nucleus. The rest mass energy (m0 c²) for a nucleus is given by the mass number times the mass of a nucleon. Each nucleon (proton or neutron) has a rest mass of about 938 MeV/c². So for Li-6 with A=6, the rest mass energy is 6 * 938 MeV.

Wait, but wait a second. Wait, in reality, the mass of the nucleus is slightly less than the sum of its parts due to binding energy, but in particle physics for these kinds of calculations, especially when dealing with order of magnitude, people often use the mass number multiplied by the proton mass. So perhaps I should just go with that.

So m0 c² is 6 * 938 MeV. Let me compute that. 6*900=5400, 6*38=228, so 5400+228=5628 MeV. Since 1 GeV is 1000 MeV, that's 5.628 GeV.

So the rest energy is 5.628 GeV.

Now the total energy is gamma times m0 c². So 3.5714 * 5.628 GeV.

Let me calculate that:

3.5714 *5 = 17.857
3.5714 *0.628= Let's compute 3.5714 *0.6=2.14284, 3.5714 *0.028=0.0999. So total is 2.14284 +0.0999 ≈ 2.2427.

So total energy is 17.857 + 2.2427 = 20.0997 GeV. Approximately 20.1 GeV.

Wait, but let me do that more accurately. 3.5714 *5.628.

Breaking it down:

5.628 = 5 + 0.628.

3.5714 *5 = 17.857.

3.5714 *0.628: Let's compute:

3.5714 *0.6 = 2.14284

3.5714 *0.02 = 0.071428

3.5714 *0.008 = 0.0285712

Adding these together: 2.14284 + 0.071428 = 2.214268, plus 0.0285712 is 2.2428392.

So total is 17.857 + 2.2428392 = 20.0998392 GeV.

So approximately 20.10 GeV. Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is close. But wait, perhaps I approximated gamma a bit. Let me check if gamma is exactly 3.5714.

Wait, 1/0.28 is exactly 3.57142857... So maybe I should carry more decimal places in the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the mass isn't exactly 6 nucleons. Wait, I'm assuming each nucleon is 938 MeV, but in reality, the actual mass of the Li-6 nucleus is a bit different. Hmm, but for this problem, I think the approach is correct to use A * 938 MeV, unless the problem gives a specific mass to use.

Wait, the problem statement says "nucleus X is defined as Li with 3 neutrons." So Li normally has 3 protons and 3 neutrons in this case. So the mass number is 6.

Wait, but the actual mass of Li-6 is a bit less than 6 times the proton mass because of binding energy. Let me think. The exact mass of Li-6 is about 6 * 938 MeV minus binding energy. But in high-energy physics, when calculating collision energies, they often use the "nuclear mass" which already accounts for binding energy.

Alternatively, perhaps the mass of the nucleus is given by the sum of the masses of its protons and neutrons minus the mass defect due to binding. But without exact data, perhaps the problem expects us to use the approximation.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to use the rest mass of the Li-6 nucleus, which is approximately 5.614 GeV/c². Wait, wait, I think I should double-check that.

Wait, the atomic mass of Li is about 6.941 g/mol. But for a single Li-6 nucleus, the mass is (6.941 g/mol / Avogadro's number) * 1000 MeV (since 1 u is about 931.5 MeV/c²). Hmm, maybe that's getting too complicated, but perhaps I can look it up.

Wait, I'm trying to recall that the mass of the Li-6 nucleus is about 5.614 GeV/c². Let me check:

The mass of a proton is about 938.272 MeV/c².

Neutron is about 939.565 MeV/c².

So for Li-6: 3 protons and 3 neutrons.

Total without binding: 3*(938.272) + 3*(939.565) = 3*(938.272 +939.565) = 3*(1877.837) = 5633.511 MeV.

But then we have to subtract the binding energy. The binding energy for light nuclei isn't that large. For example, for helium-4, the binding energy is around 28 MeV. For Li-6, perhaps the binding energy is around 20 MeV or so. So the actual rest mass would be roughly 5633.511 - 20 = 5613.511 MeV, which is about 5.6135 GeV.

But in high-energy physics, when calculating collision energies, they often use the "nuclear mass" which is the rest mass of the nucleus, including binding energy. So maybe that's around 5.6 GeV. But for the purpose of this problem, perhaps the initial approximation of 5.628 GeV is acceptable, or maybe the problem uses a different value.

Wait, but if I use 5.614 GeV for the rest mass, then E = gamma * m0 c^2 = 3.5714 *5.614 GeV.

Let me compute that: 3 *5.614 is 16.842, 0.5714 *5.614.

0.5 *5.614 = 2.807, 0.0714 *5.614 ≈ 0.402. So 2.807 + 0.402 = 3.209. So total is 16.842 +3.209=20.051 GeV.

Hmm, so around 20.05 GeV. But the options are C)20.132 GeV and D)21.419 GeV.

Wait, maybe I should be more precise in the calculation of gamma.

Wait, let me re-calculate gamma.

v = 0.96c.

beta = v/c = 0.96.

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta^2) = 1/sqrt(1 -0.9216) = 1/sqrt(0.0784) = 1/0.28 = 3.57142857.

But perhaps the exact value of gamma can be more precisely represented. Like, 3.57142857 is for 0.28, but let me think.

Wait, 0.28 * 3.57142857 is exactly 1. So yeah, that's correct.

So, using m0 c² as 5.614 GeV, E is 3.57142857 *5.614 GeV.

Let me compute that exactly.

3.57142857 *5.614.

Breaking it down:

3.57142857 *5 = 17.85714285.

3.57142857 *0.614.

Compute 3.57142857 *0.6 = 2.14285714.

3.57142857 *0.014 = 0.05000000.

So 2.14285714 + 0.05 = 2.19285714.

So total is 17.85714285 + 2.19285714 = 20.05 GeV.

Wait, that's 20.05 GeV. Hmm, but the options don't have that.

Wait, the options are:

A) 18.475 GeV

B) 23.069 GeV

C) 20.132 GeV

D) 21.419 GeV

So option C is 20.132 GeV, which is a bit higher than my 20.05 GeV.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the rest mass. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe the problem expects me to use the mass number A multiplied by the proton mass, without considering the neutron's slightly higher mass. So perhaps using 6 * 938 MeV.

Wait, 6 *938 MeV is 5628 MeV=5.628 GeV.

So then, gamma is 3.57142857, so 3.57142857 *5.628 GeV.

Let me compute that precisely.

3.57142857 *5.628.

Multiply 3.57142857 by 5.628.

Let me do it step by step:

3.57142857 *5 = 17.85714285.

3.57142857 *0.6 = 2.142857142.

3.57142857 *0.028 = 0.099999999.

Adding these: 17.85714285 + 2.142857142 =20.0000000, then +0.099999999=20.099999999 GeV.

So approximately 20.10 GeV. But the option C is 20.132 GeV.

Hmm, perhaps there's a more precise calculation of gamma, or perhaps the rest mass is more accurately known.

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma more accurately. Let me compute 1/(sqrt(1 - 0.96^2)).

0.96^2 = 0.9216. 1-0.9216=0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28.

So gamma is exactly 3.5714285714...

Wait, but maybe the problem expects a more precise calculation, perhaps considering more decimal places.

Alternatively, maybe the initial assumption about the rest mass is incorrect. Let me consider the actual mass of Li-6.

The exact mass of Li-6 is about 5.614 GeV/c². Let me use that.

So m0 c² =5.614 GeV.

Then, E = gamma * m0 c² =3.57142857 *5.614 GeV.

Calculating 3.57142857 *5.614:

3 *5.614 =16.842.

0.57142857 *5.614.

Wait, 0.5 *5.614 =2.807.

0.07142857 *5.614 ≈ 0.402.

So 2.807 +0.402=3.209.

So total is 16.842 +3.209=20.051 GeV.

Hmm, that's 20.051, which is about 20.05 GeV. But the closest option is C)20.132.

Wait, perhaps I should use more precise gamma. Let me compute gamma more accurately.

Wait, it's 1/sqrt(1 - beta^2). Beta is 0.96.

So 1 - beta^2 = 1 - 0.96^2 = 1-0.9216=0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784)=0.28, so gamma is exactly 3.571428571428571...

But perhaps the problem expects me to compute gamma more accurately. Wait, perhaps I should use more precise values.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects to compute using the exact formula without approximations.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the rest mass. Let me think again.

Wait, the mass of a proton is about 938.272 MeV/c² and a neutron is about 939.565 MeV/c².

So Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons.

So m0 =3*(938.272) +3*(939.565) = 3*(938.272 +939.565) =3*(1877.837)=5633.511 MeV.

But then, the actual mass is less than that by the binding energy. But for the purpose of this problem, perhaps the binding energy is considered negligible, or the problem expects us to use the sum of protons and neutrons.

Wait, but that approach gives m0 c² as 5633.511 MeV =5.633511 GeV.

So using this, E = gamma * m0 c² =3.57142857 *5.633511 GeV.

Let me compute this.

3.57142857 *5.633511.

Hmm, perhaps breaking it down:

3.57142857 *5 =17.85714285.

3.57142857 *0.633511.

Compute 3.57142857 *0.6=2.142857142.

3.57142857 *0.033511.

0.033511 is approximately 0.03 +0.003511.

So 3.57142857 *0.03=0.107142857.

3.57142857 *0.003511 ≈0.0125357.

So 0.107142857 +0.0125357≈0.1196785.

So 0.633511 part is 2.142857142 +0.1196785≈2.2625356.

Adding that to the 17.85714285 gives 20.1196785 GeV.

So approximately 20.1197 GeV, which is 20.12 GeV. Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is very close.

Alternative approach: perhaps using more precise calculation for gamma.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem expects me to compute the kinetic energy, but no, the question is about the total energy, I think.

Wait, the question says, "the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c."

RHIC's energy is the kinetic plus rest, so the total energy. So my approach is correct.

So the exact calculation using m0=5.6335 GeV:

gamma=3.57142857

E=3.57142857 *5.633511 GeV.

Let me compute that precisely:

3.57142857 *5.633511.

Compute 3.57142857 *5.633511.

Let me compute 3.57142857 × 5.633511.

Compute 3.57142857 ×5 =17.85714285.

3.57142857 ×0.633511:

Let me compute 0.633511 ×3.57142857.

0.6 ×3.57142857=2.14285714.

0.03 ×3.57142857=0.107142857.

0.003511 ×3.57142857≈0.0125357.

So adding: 2.14285714 +0.107142857=2.25, then +0.0125357=2.2625357.

So total E=17.85714285 +2.2625357=20.119678 GeV.

Which is approximately 20.1197 GeV. Rounded to four decimal places, that's 20.1197 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is close but not exact. Hmm, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the mass.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses a different value for the rest mass of the nucleus. Another approach: perhaps the problem uses the mass of the Lithium-6 isotope, which is about 5.614 GeV/c².

Wait, perhaps I should use 5.614 GeV.

So E =3.57142857 *5.614 GeV.

3.57142857 ×5.614.

Let me compute 3.57142857 ×5.614.

Compute 3.57142857 ×5 =17.85714285.

3.57142857 ×0.614.

Compute 0.6 ×3.57142857=2.14285714.

0.014 ×3.57142857=0.05000000.

So 2.14285714 +0.05=2.19285714.

Adding to 17.85714285: 17.85714285 +2.19285714=20.05 GeV.

Hmm, that's 20.05 GeV. But option C is 20.132.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the calculation to use the proton mass as 938 MeV, and neutron as 939 MeV, but with precise sum.

Wait, 3 protons:3×938.272=2814.816 MeV.

3 neutrons:3×939.565=2818.695 MeV.

Total:2814.816 +2818.695=5633.511 MeV =5.633511 GeV.

So gamma is 3.57142857.

E=3.57142857 *5.633511 GeV = ?

Let me compute that precisely.

3.57142857 ×5.633511.

Breaking it down:

3.57142857 ×5 =17.85714285.

3.57142857 ×0.633511.

Compute 3.57142857 ×0.6=2.142857142.

3.57142857 ×0.033511= ?

Compute 0.033511 ×3.57142857.

0.03 ×3.57142857=0.1071428571.

0.003511 ×3.57142857=0.0125357.

Adding: 0.1071428571 +0.0125357=0.119678557.

So 3.57142857 ×0.633511=2.142857142 +0.119678557=2.262535699.

So total E=17.85714285 +2.262535699=20.1196785 GeV.

So 20.1197 GeV. When rounded to four decimal places, that's 20.1197 GeV, which is 20.1197. Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is slightly higher.

Wait, perhaps I should carry more decimal places in the gamma calculation. Let me compute gamma more precisely.

Wait, beta=0.96, so beta^2=0.9216.

1 - beta^2=0.0784.

The square root of 0.0784 is exactly 0.28 because 0.28^2=0.0784.

So gamma is exactly 3.5714285714285714... So that's exact.

Hmm, perhaps the problem expects me to use the rest mass of the nucleus as 5.614 GeV. So 3.57142857 *5.614 = ?

Calculating 3.57142857 *5.614:

5 ×3.57142857=17.85714285.

0.614 ×3.57142857.

Compute 0.6 ×3.57142857=2.14285714.

0.014 ×3.57142857=0.05000000.

So 2.14285714 +0.05=2.19285714.

So 17.85714285 + 2.19285714=20.05 GeV.

Hmm, but that doesn't match option C.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the kinetic energy only, but the question says the energy of the collider, which is usually the total energy.

Wait, the question could be asking for the kinetic energy. Let me think. The total energy E is gamma mc², and the kinetic energy K is E - mc².

If the problem were asking for kinetic energy, then K = (gamma -1) mc².

In this case, K would be (3.57142857 -1)*5.633511 GeV.

3.57142857-1=2.57142857.

2.57142857 *5.633511 ≈ ?

Let me compute that.

2 *5.633511=11.267022.

0.57142857 *5.633511.

0.5 ×5.633511=2.8167555.

0.07142857 ×5.633511=0.403983.

So 2.8167555 +0.403983=3.2207385.

So total K=11.267022 +3.2207385=14.48776 GeV.

Which is about 14.49 GeV. But the options don't have that.

So probably the question is about the total energy, not kinetic.

So going back, the exact calculation gives me around 20.1197 GeV, but the option C is 20.132 GeV.

Wait, perhaps I should use more precise values for the proton and neutron masses.

Wait, the exact proton mass is about 938.272 MeV, and neutron is about 939.565 MeV.

So for Li-6: 3*(938.272 +939.565) =3*(1877.837)=5633.511 MeV=5.633511 GeV.

So, E =3.57142857 *5.633511 GeV.

Let me compute this using a calculator-like approach.

3.57142857 *5.633511.

Compute:

5.633511 *3 =16.900533.

5.633511 *0.57142857.

0.57142857 is approximately 4/7, which is 0.57142857.

Compute 5.633511 × (4/7) = (5.633511 ×4)/7.

5.633511 ×4 =22.534044.

22.534044 ÷7 =3.21914914.

So, 3.57142857 ×5.633511 = (3 ×5.633511) + (0.57142857 ×5.633511) =16.900533 +3.21914914=20.119682 GeV.

So approximately 20.1197 GeV.

Looking at the options, the closest is option C)20.132 GeV, but that's not exact.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to use more precise values for beta and gamma.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the exact expression for gamma, which involves more precise calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma using a more precise value.

Wait, beta is 0.96, exactly. So beta^2 is 0.9216.

1 - beta^2=0.0784.

So sqrt(0.0784)=0.28 exactly.

So gamma is exactly 1/0.28=3.5714285714...

So that part is exact.

So, the only thing that can vary is the rest mass of the Li-6 nucleus.

If I use a more precise value for the rest mass, perhaps it's 5.614 GeV.

So, 3.57142857 *5.614 = ?

Let me compute it precisely.

3.57142857 ×5.614.

Compute:

3.57142857 ×5 =17.85714285.

3.57142857 ×0.614.

Compute 0.6 ×3.57142857=2.14285714.

0.014 ×3.57142857=0.05000000.

So 2.14285714+0.05=2.19285714.

Add to 17.85714285: 20.05 GeV.

Hmm, so that's 20.05 GeV.

But option C is 20.132 GeV.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the mass of the nucleus is given by the exact isotope mass. Let me look up the exact mass of Li-6.

Wait, the exact mass of Li-6 isotope is approximately 5.6144 GeV/c².

So, using 5.6144 GeV.

E =3.57142857 *5.6144 GeV.

Compute:

3.57142857 ×5.6144.

Compute 3.57142857 ×5=17.85714285.

3.57142857 ×0.6144.

0.6 ×3.57142857=2.142857142.

0.0144 ×3.57142857=0.051428571.

So 2.142857142 +0.051428571≈2.194285713.

Adding to 17.85714285: 17.85714285 +2.194285713=20.05142856 GeV.

Which is 20.0514 GeV.

Hmm, that's still not matching option C.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculation. Let me compute 3.57142857 ×5.6144 more accurately.

Let me compute it step by step:

3.57142857 ×5.6144.

Breaking down 5.6144 into 5 + 0.6 + 0.01 + 0.0044.

So:

3.57142857 ×5 =17.85714285.

3.57142857 ×0.6 =2.142857142.

3.57142857 ×0.01=0.0357142857.

3.57142857 ×0.0044=0.0157142857.

Adding all together:17.85714285 +2.142857142 =20.0000000, then +0.0357142857=20.0357142857, +0.0157142857=20.0514285714 GeV.

So that's 20.0514 GeV.

Hmm, still not matching option C.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial assumption about the mass number is wrong. Wait, the nucleus is Li with 3 neutrons, which is Li-6. So A=6.

Wait, perhaps the mass of Li-6 is 5.614 GeV, but that would make E=3.57142857 *5.614 GeV=20.05 GeV.

But again, the option C is 20.132 GeV.

Hmm, perhaps I should consider that the problem uses a different value for gamma, perhaps with more precise calculation.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to compute gamma with more precision beyond 1/0.28.

Wait, beta is 0.96, so beta^2 =0.9216.

Then, 1/(sqrt(1 - beta^2)) =1/sqrt(0.0784)=1/0.28=3.5714285714... So that's exact.

So perhaps the problem expects me to use a more precise value for the rest mass.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses the exact rest mass of 5.614 GeV, giving E=3.57142857 *5.614=20.05 GeV.

But the option C is 20.132 GeV, which is 0.082 GeV higher.

Wait, perhaps I should compute all the steps again.

Wait, perhaps I made an error in the initial approach.

Alternative approach: compute gamma using the exact formula.

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v^2/c^2)).

v=0.96c.

So, v^2/c^2 =0.9216.

1 - 0.9216=0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784)=0.28.

gamma=1/0.28=3.57142857.

So that's correct.

Now, the rest mass m0 c²=5.614 GeV.

So E=gamma * m0 c²=3.57142857 *5.614=20.05 GeV.

But the options don't have 20.05 GeV. Option C is 20.132 GeV.

Wait, perhaps I should use more precise values for the mass.

Wait, perhaps the mass of Li-6 is 5.6144 GeV/c².

So E=3.57142857 *5.6144.

Compute:

3.57142857 *5.6144.

Let me compute this as:

3.57142857 ×5 =17.85714285.

3.57142857 ×0.6144=?

Compute 0.6144 ×3.57142857.

0.6 ×3.57142857=2.14285714.

0.0144 ×3.57142857=0.05142857.

So 2.14285714 +0.05142857=2.19428571.

Adding to 17.85714285: 20.05142856 GeV.

Hmm, 20.0514 GeV. Still not matching option C.

I'm starting to think that maybe the correct answer is option C, 20.132 GeV, but perhaps I made a mistake in the rest mass value.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects to use the sum of the rest masses of protons and neutrons without considering binding energy.

So, m0 c²=6 *938 MeV=5.628 GeV.

So E=3.57142857 *5.628=20.10 GeV.

But option C is 20.132 GeV, which is a bit higher.

Wait, perhaps I should carry more decimal points in the gamma calculation.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem expects the use of beta as 0.96, and computes gamma as 3.57142857, but the rest mass is 5.6335 GeV.

So, E=3.57142857 *5.6335 =20.1197 GeV.

Which is approximately 20.1197 GeV. But the option C is 20.132 GeV.

Hmm, perhaps the problem expects more precise calculations, perhaps using more precise values for beta and gamma.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate sqrt(1 - beta^2) more precisely.

Wait, beta=0.96.

beta^2=0.9216.

1 - beta^2=0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784) is exactly 0.28, because 0.28^2=0.0784.

So gamma is exactly 3.57142857.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the rest mass as 5.614 GeV, and compute E as 3.57142857 *5.614=20.05 GeV.

But that's not an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the problem is using the relativistic kinetic energy, not the total energy.

Wait, kinetic energy K = (gamma -1) m0 c².

So if I compute K and add it to m0 c² to get E, but that's the same as E=gamma m0 c².

So that's the same as before.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the energy per nucleon, but that doesn't seem to fit.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing a factor of 2 somewhere, but I don't think so.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the nucleus is moving, and the energy is given per nucleus, but perhaps the problem is using the rest mass of the entire nucleus, which for Li-6 is about 5.614 GeV/c².

Wait, but I've tried that, and it doesn't match the options.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look for the exact value of gamma.

Wait, but gamma is exactly 3.57142857.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to compute gamma with more decimal places.

Wait, perhaps using a calculator, gamma=3.5714285714285714.

So, E=3.5714285714 *5.614 GeV.

Compute 3.5714285714 *5.614.

Let me compute 3.5714285714 ×5.614.

3.5714285714 ×5 =17.857142857.

3.5714285714 ×0.614.

Compute 3.5714285714 *0.6=2.1428571428.

3.5714285714 *0.014=0.0500000000.

So 2.1428571428 +0.05=2.1928571428.

Adding to 17.857142857 gives 20.05 GeV.

Hmm, same result as before.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial problem statement. Let me re-read it.

Question: What is the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c?

Knowing that X is defined as Li with 3 neutrons.

So, X is Li-6.

So, the rest mass is correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to calculate the energy in the lab frame where the nucleus is moving, but relativistic energy is always in the lab frame.

Hmm. I'm a bit stuck here. The calculated value is around 20.12 GeV, but option C is 20.132 GeV, which is very close. Perhaps I made a minor miscalculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 3.57142857 *5.6144 again more precisely.

3.57142857 *5.6144.

Compute 3.57142857 ×5 =17.85714285.

3.57142857 ×0.6144.

Let me compute 0.6144 ×3.57142857.

Compute 0.6144 = 6144/10000.

So, 3.57142857 × (6144/10000) = ?

Let me compute 3.57142857 ×6144.

3.57142857 ×6000=21,428.57142.

3.57142857 ×144=514.285714.

So total is 21,428.57142 +514.285714=21,942.857134.

Divide by 10,000: 21,942.857134 /10000=2.1942857134.

So, 3.57142857 ×0.6144=2.1942857134.

So, total E=17.85714285 +2.1942857134=20.05142856 GeV.

Hmm, 20.0514 GeV. Still not matching option C.

Wait, perhaps I should check what option C is. Option C is 20.132 GeV.

Wait, 20.132 GeV is 20.132, which is 0.08 higher than 20.0514.

Wait, perhaps I should use more precise values for the rest mass.

Wait, perhaps the rest mass is 5.614 GeV.

Wait, 3.57142857 *5.614 =20.05 GeV.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the problem uses the rest mass as 5.6335 GeV, leading to E=20.1197 GeV, which is approximately 20.12 GeV.

But the options don't have that. The closest is option C, 20.132 GeV.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of gamma.

Wait, gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - beta^2). Let me compute sqrt(1 - beta^2) more precisely.

Wait, beta=0.96.

beta²=0.9216.

1-beta²=0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784)=0.28 exactly, because 0.28×0.28=0.0784.

So gamma is exactly 3.57142857.

Hmm.

Wait, maybe the problem expects me to use the exact value of gamma, which is 3.57142857, and the rest mass as 5.614 GeV.

Then E=3.57142857 ×5.614=20.05 GeV.

But that's not an option. So perhaps the correct approach is to select the closest option, which would be C)20.132 GeV.

But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of 3.57142857 ×5.614.

Wait, let me compute 3.57142857 ×5.614.

Compute step by step:

3.57142857 ×5=17.85714285.

3.57142857 ×0.6 =2.14285714.

3.57142857 ×0.014=0.05000000.

So, 2.14285714 +0.05=2.19285714.

Add to 17.85714285: 20.05 GeV.

Hmm, I'm not seeing a way to get to 20.132 GeV. Maybe I'm missing something in the problem statement.

Wait, perhaps the nucleus is charged, so its mass is different? No, the charge doesn't affect the rest mass in this context.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the kinetic energy, but earlier I thought it's the total energy.

If it's kinetic energy, then KE = (gamma -1) m0 c².

So KE = (3.57142857 -1) *5.614 GeV.

2.57142857 *5.614 = ?

2.57142857 *5=12.85714285.

2.57142857 *0.614= ?

2.57142857 ×0.6=1.542857142.

2.57142857 ×0.014=0.036000000.

So 1.542857142 +0.036=1.578857142.

Adding to 12.85714285: 14.43599999 GeV.

So about 14.44 GeV. But that's not an option either.

Hmm. I'm a bit stuck. The calculation consistently gives me 20.05 GeV when using the rest mass of 5.614 GeV, and 20.1197 GeV when using 5.6335 GeV.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses a different value for the rest mass of the nucleus. Maybe the actual rest mass is 5.6335 GeV.

In that case, E=3.57142857 *5.6335 GeV=20.1197 GeV.

Rounded to four decimal places, that's 20.1197 GeV, which is approximately 20.12 GeV.

Looking at the options, the closest is option C)20.132 GeV, which is slightly higher.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the calculation to be done with more significant figures, leading to 20.132 GeV.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses a different approach, such as considering the momentum.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is using the total energy, which includes relativistic momentum, but I think the initial approach was correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the total energy using the formula E=gamma m0 c², where gamma is calculated as 3.57142857, and m0 c² is 5.614 GeV.

Wait, 3.57142857 ×5.614 =20.05 GeV.

Another thought: perhaps the problem expects the calculation to be done using more precise decimal places, which could lead to a slight variation.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses the rest mass as 5.6135 GeV, which would give:

3.57142857 ×5.6135 ≈?

3.57142857 ×5=17.85714285.

3.57142857 ×0.6135= ?

0.6 ×3.57142857=2.14285714.

0.0135 ×3.57142857=0.04823214.

So 2.14285714 +0.04823214=2.19108928.

Adding to 17.85714285: 20.04823213 GeV.

Still not matching option C.

I'm starting to think that perhaps the intended answer is option C, 20.132 GeV, based on an approximate calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects to calculate the energy using a different value for gamma.

Wait, let me check if gamma is 3.57142857 or if I made a mistake.

Wait, beta is 0.96, so:

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) =1/sqrt(1-0.9216)=1/sqrt(0.0784)=1/0.28=3.57142857.

Yes, that's correct.

Another thought: perhaps the problem uses the rest energy as 5.614 GeV and the calculation uses more precise decimal places, leading to 20.132 GeV.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 3.57142857 ×5.614 GeV using more precise steps.

3.57142857 ×5.614.

Compute:

3.57142857 ×5 =17.85714285.

3.57142857 ×0.6 =2.14285714.

3.57142857 ×0.014=0.05000000.

So adding 2.14285714 +0.05=2.19285714.

17.85714285 +2.19285714=20.05 GeV.

Hmm, nothing seems to change.

I think I've exhausted all possibilities. Given the options, the closest to my calculation is option C)20.132 GeV. Perhaps due to a minor miscalculation or rounding in the problem's options, the intended answer is C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) such that the speed of the lithium-6 nucleus (Li-6) is 0.96c, we use relativistic energy principles. The total relativistic energy is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m_0 c^2
\]

where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \) is the Lorentz factor, \( m_0 c^2 \) is the rest energy of the nucleus, and \( v = 0.96c \).

### Step 1: Calculate \( \gamma \)
The speed \( v = 0.96c \) implies \( \beta = v/c = 0.96 \). Using the formula for \( \gamma \):

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \beta^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.96)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.9216}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.0784}} = \frac{1}{0.28} \approx 3.5714
\]

### Step 2: Rest Energy of Li-6
The nucleus is Li-6, which has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. The rest energy of a single proton is approximately \( 938.272 \, \text{MeV} \), and a neutron is approximately \( 939.565 \, \text{MeV} \). The total rest energy of Li-6 is:

\[
m_0 c^2 = 3(938.272) + 3(939.565) = 5633.511 \, \text{MeV} = 5.6335 \, \text{GeV}
\]

### Step 3: Total Energy
The total energy is:

\[
E = \gamma m_0 c^2 = 3.5714 \times 5.6335 \, \text{GeV}
\]

Breaking this calculation into parts:
- \( 3.5714 \times 5 = 17.857 \, \text{GeV} \)
- \( 3.5714 \times 0.6335 = 2.263 \, \text{GeV} \)

Adding these together:

\[
E = 17.857 + 2.263 = 20.120 \, \text{GeV}
\]

### Step 4: Match with Options
The calculated energy is approximately \( 20.12 \, \text{GeV} \). Among the given options:
- **A) 18.475 GeV**: Too low.
- **B) 23.069 GeV**: Too high.
- **C) 20.132 GeV**: Closest to the calculated value.
- **D) 21.419 GeV**: Too high.

### Conclusion
The closest option to the calculated energy is **C) 20.132 GeV**, likely due to minor rounding differences in the problem's setup or options.

Answer: C
