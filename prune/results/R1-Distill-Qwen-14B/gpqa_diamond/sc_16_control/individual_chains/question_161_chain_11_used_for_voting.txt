Okay, so I'm trying to solve this electron microscopy question. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand what's going on.

Mike is working with a high-resolution transmission electron microscope operating at 1000 kV. He connected vacuum pumps to get an ultra-high vacuum with a pressure less than 10^-9 Torr. The idea is to remove gas molecules so that the electron microscopy is better because there's less scattering. But even in that state, some gas particles are still present, as detected by a mass spectrometer.

Mike determined the mean free path of these gas molecules as λ1. The mean free path is the average distance a molecule travels between collisions. Factors like volume, pressure, and temperature would affect this. But then, when he starts the electron beam, he notices that the mean free path changes to λ2. The temperature is the same, so that shouldn't be a factor. The question is, why did λ change?

Hmm, I remember that the mean free path (λ) depends on the pressure and the cross-sectional area for collisions. The formula I think is λ = 1/(√2 n π d² ), where n is the number density and d is the mean collision diameter. Or another formula I've heard is λ = (k*T)/(√2 π d² P), where k is Boltzmann's constant, T is temperature, P pressure, and d is the diameter. So if pressure changes, λ changes.

Wait, but Mike's pressure was already very low. The problem says that the pressure is <1e-9 Torr. But when he turns on the electron beam, does that affect the pressure? Or maybe the presence of the electron beam somehow influences the gas molecules.

Wait, another thought. High-energy electrons can cause various effects in gases. Like, they can ionize the gas molecules. So when the electron beam is on, it might be causing the gas to become ionized. Ionized gas molecules have different behavior. For example, charged particles will interact with the electric fields in the electron microscope, perhaps leading to different collision rates.

Wait, how about the concept of mean free path in the presence of an electron beam. The electron beam is moving at high speeds (since it's 1000 kV, so relativistic speeds maybe?), and the gas molecules are much slower. So when the beam is on, perhaps the electrons are scattering more off the gas molecules, thereby altering the mean free path.

Wait, but in the absence of the electron beam, the gas molecules collide with each other, and their mean free path is λ1. When the beam is on, each gas molecule can also potentially interact with the electrons in the beam. So each gas molecule may have an additional collision source: the electron beam. This would effectively reduce the mean free path because each gas molecule is now more likely to collide not just with other gas molecules, but also with the electrons.

Wait, but in the initial state (no beam), the mean free path is λ1. With the beam on, the gas molecules can either collide with each other or with the electrons. So the total collision rate increases, meaning the mean free path should decrease because the molecules are colliding more frequently. So λ2 would be less than λ1.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think about the factors. The mean free path in a gas is given by λ = 1/(n σ √2), where σ is the collision cross-section. When the electron beam is on, the gas molecules can also collide with the electrons, so each gas molecule has another way to collide. So the effective collision rate would be higher, leading to a shorter mean free path. So λ2 < λ1.

Looking at the options, option C says λ2 < λ1. So that's the conclusion.

But wait, are there any other factors? For instance, if the electron beam somehow ionizes the gas, would the mean free path change? Because ionized gas (plasma) has different behavior. In a plasma, the mean free path might be longer because charged particles respond to electric fields and might move in ways that reduce collisions. Or maybe the opposite.

Wait, if the gas becomes ionized, you can have Coulomb interactions between ions and electrons. This could lead to more frequent collisions. But that's getting a bit complicated. Alternatively, ionized particles might have different cross-sections for collisions with each other and with the electrons.

Alternatively, perhaps the electron beam causes the gas to heat up, but the question states that the temperature remains the same, so that's not a factor.

Hmm, but the initial situation is a very low pressure, so the gas is mostly not interacting with itself. When the electron beam is on, the electrons are high energy, which would cause more ionizing collisions with the gas molecules. So each gas molecule is either being ionized or perhaps acting as targets for the electrons. Either way, the gas is experiencing more collisions, so the mean free path for the gas molecules (λ) would be shorter because they're colliding more frequently.

So, in that case, λ2 would be less than λ1. So the correct answer is option C.

The mean free path (λ) of gas molecules in a vacuum is determined by factors such as pressure, temperature, and the collision cross-section of the molecules. Initially, Mike measured the mean free path as λ1 under ultra-high vacuum conditions (<10^-9 Torr) with no electron beam present. However, upon initiating the electron beam, he observed a new mean free path, λ2, which deviated from λ1.

When the electron beam is turned on, several factors come into play. High-energy electrons in the beam can ionize the gas molecules, creating charged particles (ions and electrons). This ionization increases the interaction between gas molecules and the electron beam, as well as between gas molecules themselves. The increased interaction leads to a higher collision rate, effectively reducing the mean free path of the gas molecules. Since the mean free path is inversely proportional to the collision rate, λ2 is expected to be shorter than λ1.

Additionally, the electron beam introduces an external influence that alters the behavior of the gas molecules. Even though the temperature remains constant, the presence of the beam introduces additional scattering events, further reducing the mean free path. Therefore, the observed λ2 is less than the initial λ1.

Given the options, the correct conclusion is that λ2 < λ1.
