Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reactions. But I'll try to break it down step by step.

The question is about the reaction between 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol and bromine. I need to figure out what the major outcome is and choose the correct option from A to D.

First, I should probably draw the structure of the starting material to visualize it better. 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol. So cyclopentene has a five-membered ring with a double bond. The 'enol' part tells me there's an -OH group attached. Enols are compounds with a double bond adjacent to an -OH group.

Wait, the structure would have a cyclopentane ring with a double bond between carbons 1 and 2 (since it's cyclopent-1-enol). The enol part is at position 1, so the OH is on C2? Let me think: in enols, the double bond is between the alpha and beta carbons adjacent to the hydroxyl. So maybe the structure is a cyclopentene ring with the double bond between C1 and C2, and the OH on C2. Also, there are two methyl groups on C4.

So the structure would be: cyclopentene ring where C1 is double-bonded to C2. C2 has an -OH group, and C4 has two methyl groups attached.

Now, the reaction is with bromine. Bromine, or Br2, is a dienophile in some cases, but wait, this compound is an enol, which is an alpha,beta-unsaturated alcohol. Oh right, when enols react with bromine, it's typically an addition reaction. The double bond is more reactive here because of the conjugation with the hydroxyl group.

In such cases, bromine adds across the double bond. Since the double bond is between C1 and C2, the Br2 will add to these positions. The addition can be either via a concerted mechanism (like in an alkene addition) or maybe via a cyclic bromonium intermediate. But since the starting material is an enol, the addition might be influenced by the hydroxyl group.

Wait, wait. Another possibility: the enol could tautomerize to a ketone under certain conditions. Oh, but does bromine addition occur before or after tautomerization? Hmm. Enols are in equilibrium with ketones or aldehydes, but the reaction conditions might influence this. If the reaction is done in a protic solvent or under acidic conditions, the enol might more readily tautomerize to the ketone. But I'm not sure if the reaction conditions are acidic here. The question doesn't specify, so I'm not sure.

But in the absence of specific conditions, I'll assume that the reaction is done in a way that the enol form is present. So, bromine adds to the double bond of the enol.

In an addition reaction, the bromine would add to the double bond in a way that the most substituted positions get the bromine. But wait, in this case, the double bond is between C1 and C2, which are both sp2 carbons. The enol is conjugated with the hydroxyl group, so the addition would be similar to that of an alkene. So, when Br2 adds, it would add across the double bond, giving a dibromide.

Wait, but wait. Enols are more reactive than simple alkenes because of the conjugation with the hydroxyl group. So the addition reaction would proceed quickly. But in the product, where would the Br atoms go?

Bromine adds in a way that the two Br atoms attach to adjacent carbons. So, C1 and C2 would each get a Br. Also, the addition would be anti, because Br2 opens the double bond in a way that the Brs add to opposite sides.

Wait, but in the initial structure, the enol has the hydroxyl on C2. So after addition, the Br would be on C1 and C2. Then, what happens next? Because the starting material is an enol, which has an acidic alpha hydrogen. The OH is on C2, and the adjacent carbons (C1 and C3) have alpha hydrogens.

But wait, after the addition of Br2, the ring would have Br on C1 and C2, making a vicinal dibromide. But wait, the starting material is a cyclopentene, so adding Br2 would make a cyclopentane with Br's on C1 and C2.

But wait, after adding Br to C1 and C2, the molecule would have Br-C-C-OH (but wait, the OH is on C2, so after adding Br to C2, the structure would have Br on C2 and C1, and the OH is still there.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's think again.

The starting material is 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol. So, the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the OH is on C2. So when Br2 adds, it adds across C1 and C2, adding Br to both. So the product would have Br on C1 and C2, and the OH is on C2. So the structure would be something like Br-C-C-OH, but in a ring.

But wait, the options don't have such a structure. Looking at the options:

Option A: (1R,2S)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol. So that's Br on C1 and C2, OH on C2. Also, 4,4-dimethyl.

Option D: (1R,2R)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol. So Br on C1 and C2, same as A, but different stereochemistry.

Wait, so the product would have Brs on C1 and C2, and the OH on C2 as well. But wait, in the starting material, the OH is on C2, so after adding Br to C2, would the OH still be there?

Wait, no. Because when adding Br2 across the double bond, the OH is on C2, which is one of the carbons where Br adds. So the product would have Brs on C1 and C2, and the OH is still on C2. But wait, that would lead to having Br and OH on the same carbon. Does that make sense?

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the positions. Let me clarify: The starting material is cyclopent-1-enol. So the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the OH is on C2. So adding Br2 would add Br atoms to C1 and C2, making the structure have Br on C1 and C2. But the OH is on C2, which is now a Br and an OH on the same carbon. That can't be right because that would cause steric strain, but maybe it's possible. Alternatively, perhaps the OH is on C1 and the double bond is between C1 and C2. Wait, no, the name is cyclopent-1-enol, which implies the double bond starts at C1.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the possibility of a different reaction. Oh wait, another possibility: the enol could tautomerize to a ketone. Let me think: Enols can tautomerize to ketones via keto-enol tautomerism. So maybe the reaction isn't with the enol but with the ketone. But would that happen?

If the enol tautomerizes to a ketone, then we have 4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone. Then, reacting that with bromine. But how would Br2 react with a ketone? Well, in the presence of a ketone, bromine can undergo a conjugate addition (Michael addition) if there's an alpha position that's electron-rich. Alternatively, if there's an alpha hydrogen, bromine can abstract an H and add Br to the alpha position, leading to an alpha-brominated ketone.

Wait, but in this case, the starting material is an enol, but if it's more reactive towards addition, perhaps the reaction proceeds via the enol form.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me go back. The reaction is the addition of Br2 to an enol. The enol is more reactive than the corresponding ketone because of the conjugated double bond. So the Br2 would add to the double bond, leading to a di bromide.

So after addition, the product would have Br on C1 and C2, and the OH would still be on C2. So the structure would be 1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol.

Wait, but looking at the options, options A and D are about this. The difference is the configuration of the chiral centers. So the question is about the stereochemistry of the addition.

So when Br2 adds to a double bond, the addition is typically anti. But in a cyclic structure, the positions could lead to different stereochemistry. Wait, in a cyclopentane ring, adding Br to C1 and C2 in anti fashion could lead to either both Brs being on the same face or opposite.

But wait, the starting material is a cyclopent-1-enol. So the double bond is in the ring, and the substituents are arranged around it. When Br2 adds, the Brs will add across the double bond. Since the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the ring is planar there, the addition could lead to either a cis or trans dibromide.

Wait, but in reality, the addition of bromine to a cyclic enol would follow the same rules as for any cyclic diene. The bromonium ring opens with anti addition, leading to the Brs adding to opposite sides of the ring.

But in the case of the cyclopentene, the addition of Br would result in a bicyclic structure? Not necessarily. Let me think about the ring. The cyclopentene has five members. Adding Br to C1 and C2 would give a vicinal dibromide.

But in the product, the OH is on C2, which already has a Br. That would give a structure where C2 has both Br and OH groups. But maybe that's possible, but I'm not sure about the steric implications.

Looking back at the options, the options A and D have 1,2-dibromo and 4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol. The difference is the configuration. So the question is about whether the addition leads to R and S configurations or both R or both S.

Wait, but the starting enol has a certain stereochemistry. Let's consider the configuration of the starting material. The starting material is 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol. So, in the enol form, the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the OH is on C2.

In the ring, the substituents on C4 are two methyl groups. So, the structure is such that C1 is connected to C2 (double bond), C2 has OH, and C4 has two methyl groups.

Now, when Br adds to the double bond, the Brs would add in a way that each Br attaches to a carbon with the correct stereochemistry. Since the addition is anti, the Brs would end up on opposite sides of the ring.

But wait, the ring is small (five-membered), so the addition would cause certain stereochemistry. Let me think about the possible products.

If the enol is in a certain conformation, adding Br across the double bond would lead to a specific configuration.

Wait, but another thought: the enol might get protonated, leading to the ketone. If that's the case, then the reaction would be with the ketone. But I'm not certain if that's the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a conjugate addition. Wait, the enol has a conjugated system (enol), so bromine could add in a 1,4 addition, but that's more typical in conjugate additions, like in the case of a dienophile.

Wait, no. Conjugate addition (like in Michael addition) typically involves adding to a conjugated diene, but this is an enol, which is alpha,beta-unsaturated. So perhaps the bromine adds across the double bond, which is the same as what I thought earlier.

So, the product would have Br on C1 and C2, and the OH on C2. So the product would be 1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol.

Looking at the options, options A and D are like that. So now I need to figure out the configuration.

The starting enol has a certain geometry. Let me imagine the double bond in the cyclopentene: C1 and C2 are double-bonded, with substituents arranged around them. Since it's an enol, the OH is on C2, and the ring is such that the substituents are trans or cis?

Wait, in the enol, the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the OH is on C2. The two methyl groups are on C4. So, how are the substituents arranged around the double bond? The methyl groups on C4 are across from each other.

But in the enol, the substituents on the double bond (C1 and C2) would have certain groups attached. On C1, perhaps nothing except the ring. On C2, the OH and the ring.

Wait, maybe I should draw the chair-like structure or something, but it's a five-membered ring. So the substituents on C2 are the OH and the ring (so adjacent to C1 and C3).

Now, when Br2 adds to the double bond, the Brs will add in an anti fashion. So the Br on C1 will be on the opposite face from the Br on C2.

But wait, the OH is on C2. So, if the Br adds to C2, then the Br and the OH are on the same carbon. That can't be, so maybe I'm getting something wrong.

Wait, no. Maybe the addition is such that the Br adds to C1 and C2. So after addition, each of those carbons has a Br.

Wait, perhaps the product is a vicinal dibromide where each of the two adjacent carbons (C1 and C2) has a Br. The OH is on C2, so the product would have Br on C1 and C2, along with the OH on C2.

Wait, but that would mean that C2 has both Br and OH. That might lead to a situation where the C-OH and C-Br are on the same carbon, but that's possible. So the product would have 1-bromo, 2-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol.

Now, looking at the options, options A and D have this structure. So what's the difference between them?

Options A and D differ in the configuration of the chiral centers. So I need to determine whether the Brs are on the same face or opposite faces, which would lead to R and S configurations.

Alternatively, perhaps the addition leads to a trans-dibromide, because the addition of Br2 is anti.

Wait, but in a ring, the addition could lead to different stereochemistry. Let me think about the chair-like transition state or something. Wait, the cyclopentene is not a chair, but a five-membered ring, which is more likely to be puckered.

In the cyclopentene, the substituents around the double bond are such that the OH is on C2, which is one end of the double bond. When Br2 adds, each Br adds to adjacent carbons with anti stereochemistry.

So, if the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the OH is on C2, the Br adds to C1 and C2 in an anti manner. So, the Br on C1 would be on the opposite face of the ring relative to the Br on C2.

But wait, in a ring, each addition affects the substituents. So if the Br on C1 is axial and the Br on C2 is equatorial, or something like that.

Wait, maybe I should consider the chair-like transition state, but for cyclopentane. Hmm, cyclopentane isn't a chair, but maybe the transition state is more like a boat or something else. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to imagine that upon addition, the Brs are added in a way that their configuration leads to either erythro or threo diastereomers.

Wait, but maybe the product would have the Brs on opposite sides of the ring. Let me think, the starting enol is in a certain conformation where the OH is on one face. Upon addition, the Brs would add in a way that they are on opposite faces.

Wait, perhaps the configuration leads to (1R,2S) or (1S,2R). So, looking at the options, options A is (1R,2S) and D is (1R,2R).

Now, I need to figure out which configuration is correct. When Br2 adds to a double bond, the addition is anti. So, in the starting material, the double bond is in a certain geometry. Let's imagine that the double bond is in a trans configuration, but wait, the starting material is an enol, so the double bond is part of the enol system.

Wait, perhaps the starting material has a certain configuration that leads to specific stereochemistry upon addition.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is in a conformation where the substituents are on the same side. For example, the OH on C2 and the methyl groups on C4 are on the same face. When Br adds to C1 and C2, the Brs would end up on opposite faces.

But without knowing the exact starting conformation, it's a bit tricky. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to a specific diastereomer based on the ring's geometry.

Wait, another approach: the product is a vicinal dibromide, so the stereochemistry depends on the starting double bond's geometry. If the starting double bond is trans, then the addition of Br would lead to a certain configuration.

Wait, but the starting material is an enol. The enol form can have either cis or trans double bonds, but in reality, most cyclopentenols are in the cis form. Wait, no, in enols, the double bond is between the alpha and beta carbons, so the configuration is usually cis because the OH is on the same side as the double bond.

Wait, perhaps that's not accurate. Let me think: in the keto form, the carbonyl group is planar. In the enol form, the double bond is between the alpha and beta carbons, and the hydroxyl is on the beta carbon. So the configuration around the double bond would be such that the OH is on the same side as the R groups.

In any case, perhaps the addition of Br would lead to a specific configuration.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the possibility of the enol tautomerizing to the ketone. If the enol converts to the ketone, then the Br would add in a conjugate fashion, leading to a bromination at the alpha position.

Wait, that's another possibility. Let me elaborate. If the enol tautomerizes to the ketone, the structure becomes 4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone. Then, bromine could add to the alpha position via a conjugate addition or via electrophilic attack.

Wait, but bromine more commonly adds to double bonds. Alternatively, in the presence of a carbonyl group, bromine can add via a conjugate mechanism (Michael addition), but that usually requires a nucleophile, which isn't the case here.

Wait, another thought: in the presence of a carbonyl, bromine can undergo a 1,2-addition or a 1,4-addition. The 1,2-addition would be the regular addition to the double bond, whereas the 1,4-addition would be a conjugate addition.

But wait, in the case of ketones, adding Br2 can lead to the formation of a bromoketone, but I'm not sure about the exact mechanism.

Alternatively, in the presence of a ketone, bromine might not add to the double bond but might instead brominate the alpha position. So, perhaps the enol tautomerizes to the ketone, and then the Br adds to an alpha carbon.

But wait, in the case of a ketone, the alpha carbons are those next to the carbonyl group. In 4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone, the carbonyl is at position 1, so the alpha carbons would be C2.

Wait, no. Let me clarify the numbering. The starting enol is 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol. So, the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the OH is on C2. When tautomerizing to the ketone, it becomes cyclopentanone with the ketone at position 1 (since the enol is at position 1). So the structure would be cyclopentan-1-one, with two methyl groups on C4.

So, the ketone is at C1. The alpha carbons are C2 (since it's adjacent to the carbonyl). So, adding Br to the alpha position would give a bromine on C2.

So, in that case, the product would be 2-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone.

Looking at the options, option B is 2-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone. Option C is 4-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone.

So, if the reaction is a bromination at the alpha position of the ketone, then the product would be option B.

But how do I decide whether the reaction is with the enol or the ketone?

The key here is whether the enol form is reactive enough to add Br2 before tautomerizing to the ketone. Enols are more reactive towards electrophilic attacks because of the conjugated double bond. So, in the presence of Br2, the enol would likely add the bromine across the double bond first, rather than tautomerizing.

But it's possible that in certain conditions, the enol tautomerizes quickly to the ketone, and then the ketone reacts. So I'm a bit stuck.

Another approach: look for the possible products. The options include both dibromides (A and D) and mono-brominated ketones (B and C). So, which is more likely?

If the reaction is addition across the double bond, then the product would be a dibromide (options A or D). If it's a substitution at the alpha position of the ketone, then it's a mono-bromide (options B or C).

So which is more likely?

In general, enols are more reactive than ketones, so the addition of Br2 would proceed through the enol. Hence, the product would be a dibromide, which is options A or D.

So, back to the dibromide scenario. The product is 1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol, with the correct stereochemistry.

Now, determining the configuration. The addition of Br2 to a double bond leads to the Brs adding with anti stereochemistry. So, in the ring, the Brs would be on opposite faces.

In the starting enol, the OH is on C2. Let's imagine the double bond in a certain configuration. The addition of Br would cause the Br on C1 and C2 to be opposite each other.

But the question is about the configuration of the chiral centers. After addition, C1 and C2 each have Br and two other substituents, making them chiral centers.

So, looking at the options, A and D are the two possible configurations.

Option A: (1R,2S)

Option D: (1R,2R)

So, which one is correct?

To figure this out, I need to model the addition. Let's imagine the double bond is in a certain configuration.

Let me imagine the cyclopentene ring with the double bond between C1 and C2. The OH is on C2. The two methyl groups are on C4, which is across the ring from the double bond.

When Br2 adds, it approaches the double bond from opposite sides. So, the Br atoms add to opposite faces.

Assuming the double bond is in a certain geometry, let's say the OH on C2 is on the same face as the methyl groups on C4.

When Br adds to C1, it might add from the top face, and Br adds to C2 from the bottom face, or vice versa.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to use the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog priority rules to assign configurations.

For option A: (1R,2S)

For C1, substituents are Br, two CH2 groups (ring), and the methyl group on C4.

Wait, no. Wait, the cyclopentane ring is a five-membered ring. So each carbon is connected to two other ring carbons.

So, for C1, substituents are Br, two ring carbons (C2 and C5), and the hydrogen(s) attached.

Wait, perhaps I should number the substituents around each carbon.

Alternatively, perhaps I should imagine the ring and the addition.

Let me imagine the ring. C1 is connected to C2 (double bond) and C5. C2 is connected to C1 (double bond), C3, and C4 (with two methyl groups). The OH is on C2.

When Br2 adds, the Brs will go to C1 and C2. The addition is such that the Brs are anti.

So, if the double bond is in a certain conformation, the Brs will be on opposite sides.

Assuming the starting enol has the OH on C2 and the methyl groups on C4, which is across from C2.

If the double bond is in a trans configuration (but I'm not sure), the addition of Br would lead to a certain configuration.

But perhaps an easier way is to consider that the addition of Br2 to an enol leads to a trans-dibromide.

Wait, another thought: in the enol form, the hydroxyl group is conjugated with the double bond. So, when Br adds, the Brs would add to opposite faces, leading to a trans configuration.

So, for the product, the Br on C1 and C2 would be on opposite faces, leading to a trans-dibromide.

In a five-membered ring, how would this look? Let me imagine the ring flat, with C1 and C2 in a certain orientation.

Alternatively, perhaps the product has the two Brs on the same face, leading to a cis addition, but I'm not certain.

Wait, I'm getting stuck on the stereochemistry. Maybe I should think about the possible products and their configurations.

Option A: (1R,2S) dibromide.

Option D: (1R,2R) dibromide.

Which one is more likely?

Another approach: consider that the addition of Br2 to an enol leads to the formation of a diastereomeric mixture. The major product would depend on the transition state.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to both Brs being on the same face, making the configuration either (R,R) or (S,S), or on opposite faces, making (R,S).

Wait, but in a ring, it's possible that the Brs end up on the same face because of the ring's puckering.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct product is option D, with both Brs being R configuration.

Wait, no, I'm not sure. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Wait, perhaps the correct product is a diastereomer where the Brs are anti, leading to (R,S) configuration.

But without knowing the exact starting structure's configuration, it's hard to say.

Wait, considering the options, options A and D are the only ones with two Brs. The others have only one Br.

So, the reaction must proceed via addition, not substitution.

Therefore, the product is a dibromide, either A or D.

Now, in my earlier thought, I thought the addition would lead to (R,S) configuration for the Brs, which would correspond to option A: (1R,2S).

But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps the addition leads to both Brs being on the same face, making either (R,R) or (S,S).

Wait, another point: when Br2 adds to a double bond, it does so via a cyclic bromonium intermediate. The bromine attacks from opposite sides, leading to the anti addition.

So, in the enol, the addition would proceed with the Brs adding on opposite sides.

So, let's assume that the starting enol has the OH on C2 on the top face. The double bond is between C1 and C2.

When Br2 adds, one Br adds to C1 from the top, and the other adds to C2 from the bottom. Or vice versa, depending on the approach.

So, the Brs are on opposite faces, leading to a trans dibromide.

In terms of configuration, let's assign priorities.

For C1, the substituents are Br (highest priority), two CH2 groups (from the ring), and a CH group (C5).

For C2, the substituents are Br (highest), OH (next), and two CH2 groups.

Wait, wait, the substituents for C1 would be:

- Br (priority 1)
- CH2 group (ring) connected to C5 (priority 2)
- CH2 group (ring) connected to C2 (priority 3)
- Hydrogen (priority 4)

Wait, no, each carbon in the ring is connected to two other carbons, one on each side. So, for C1:

Connected to C2 (double bond) and C5 (single bond). So, the substituents besides Br are:

- C2 (double bond, which counts as a single substituent)
- C5 (single bond)
- and two hydrogens (since it's a CH2 group).

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to assign priorities for each chiral center.

For C1:

Groups attached:

1. Br (highest priority)
2. CH2-C5 (ring)
3. CH2-C2 (ring)
4. H (lowest)

Wait, but actually, the substituents for C1 are:

- Br
- C2 (double bond, which is a substituent)
- C5 (single bond)
- H

Wait, perhaps it's better to draw the structure. Since I can't do that, I'll proceed logically.

Assuming that after the addition, C1 has Br, and the other substituents are from the ring and H.

Similarly, C2 has Br, OH, and substituents from the ring.

Now, for C1:

The substituents are arranged in the order of priority: Br > C2 (since it's connected to the ring) > C5 (connected to the ring) > H.

The arrangement around C1 would determine the R or S configuration.

Similarly, for C2, the substituents are Br (highest), OH (next), then the ring groups, and H.

But without knowing the exact spatial arrangement, it's tricky.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct product is option A: (1R,2S).

But I'm not certain. Another approach: look for similar reactions or examples.

Wait, in the addition of bromine to cyclopentene, the product would be 1,2-dibromocyclopentane. The configuration would depend on the addition mechanism. For cyclopentene, the addition of Br2 would lead to a trans-dibromide because the Brs add anti to each other.

In the case of our molecule, which is a substituted cyclopentene, the same applies. The Brs add anti, leading to a trans configuration.

If the Brs are trans, then the configurations at C1 and C2 would be opposite (R and S), which would correspond to option A.

So, putting it all together, the product would be (1R,2S)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol, which is option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The reaction involves 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol, which is an enol with a conjugated system consisting of a double bond between C1 and C2 and an -OH group on C2. The reaction with bromine (Br₂) proceeds via an addition mechanism, where Br₂ adds across the double bond. This addition is anti, meaning the bromine atoms add to opposite faces of the double bond.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Structure of the Starting Material**:  
   The molecule is a cyclopentene ring with a double bond between C1 and C2, an -OH group on C2, and two methyl groups on C4.

2. **Reaction Mechanism**:  
   Bromine adds across the double bond in an anti fashion, resulting in a vicinal dibromide. The product will have bromine atoms on C1 and C2, and the -OH group remains on C2.

3. **Stereochemistry of the Product**:  
   The anti addition of Br₂ leads to a trans-dibromide. This means the bromine atoms on C1 and C2 are on opposite faces of the ring. The stereochemistry of the product is determined by the priorities of the substituents on C1 and C2, following the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog rules.

4. **Evaluation of Options**:  
   - **Option A**: (1R,2S)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol. This corresponds to a trans-dibromide with opposite configurations at C1 and C2.  
   - **Option D**: (1R,2R)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol. This corresponds to a cis-dibromide with the same configuration at C1 and C2.  
   - **Options B and C**: These involve mono-brominated ketones, which would result from tautomerization of the enol to a ketone followed by bromination at the alpha position. However, the enol is more reactive than the ketone, so the reaction proceeds via the enol, making these options unlikely.

5. **Conclusion**:  
   The reaction proceeds via the enol, leading to a trans-dibromide. The correct stereochemistry is (1R,2S), corresponding to **Option A**.

ANSWER: A
