Okay, I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it carefully.

So, the question is about a reaction involving Substance X, liquid Y, and the products formed. There are a bunch of clues to piece together.

First, let's break down the information given.

1. Substance X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. So, X has an isotope with a higher atomic mass than the more common one.

2. X reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing gas W. The molecule of W has the same number of neutrons and protons. Hmm, that's interesting. So, for W, if it's a diatomic molecule, the number of protons and neutrons in each molecule would be the same.

Wait, wait. The molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. Let me think about possible gases. Hydrogen has a molecule H2. Each H has 1 proton and 0 neutrons. So H2 would have 2 protons and 0 neutrons overall, which doesn't fit because the numbers are the same. But wait, if W is something else.

Wait, another thought: The molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. Let's say the molecule has N neutrons and N protons. So, for example, if W is H2O, no, that's not right. Wait, perhaps W is CO2? No, that's not right. Maybe something else.

Wait, maybe the gas is something like NH3? No, but wait, the number of protons and neutrons in the molecule.

Wait, maybe each molecule has the same number of protons and neutrons. So for example, if the molecule is O2, then each O atom has 8 protons and 8 neutrons (since the common isotope is 16O). So O2 has 16 protons and 16 neutrons in total for the molecule. So the number of protons equals the number of neutrons. That fits. So gas W could be O2 or another diatomic molecule with similar properties.

Wait, but O2 is a gas, and when some metals react with water, they release H2 gas. So let's think about other possibilities.

Wait, maybe W is H2. Let's see: each H atom has 1 proton and 0 neutrons. So H2 would have 2 protons and 0 neutrons. That's not the same, so that doesn't fit. So W can't be H2.

Another possibility: If W is O2, each O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons, so the molecule has 16 protons and 16 neutrons. So the total number of protons and neutrons are the same, 16 each. That fits the condition. So W is O2.

Alternatively, another gas: N2. Each N has 7 protons and 7 neutrons (in 14N). So N2 has 14 protons and 14 neutrons. That also fits the condition. So W could be N2.

Or maybe W is CO2? No, because that's a triatomic molecule. Let's see: CO2 has one C (6 protons, 6 neutrons), two O (8 each). So total protons: 6 + 8*2 = 22. Neutrons: 6 + 8*2 = 22. Wait, so the total would be equal. But wait, CO2 is a molecule with three atoms, but gas? CO2 is a gas, but the reaction is with X and Y. Hmm.

But let's think about other parts of the problem to see if we can find more clues.

The precipitate G forms, and when heated, releases B. The melting point of B is near 277 K. 277 K is about 4 degrees Celsius. So B is probably a substance that melts just above freezing point of water. Common substances with that melting point? Maybe something like ammonium chloride, but wait, ammonium chloride's melting point is around 337 K. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe B is something like ice, which is 273 K, but the question says about 277 K. Maybe a different substance.

Wait, another thought: What about sodium chloride? No, NaCl has a high melting point. Wait, maybe B is something like potassium nitrate? No, that's higher. Alternatively, maybe B is a base or an acid.

The product of a certain keto acid with X contains 2 atoms of oxygen. Hmm. Wait, the product is a reaction between X and a keto acid. So X is a reagent, perhaps something that adds to a carbonyl group.

Wait, the question also states that Substance X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry. What reagent is that? Maybe something like Grignard reagents, which are organometallic reagents. They react with carbonyl groups (like in keto acids) to form alcohols.

Wait, if X is a Grignard reagent, for example, Mg is involved. Because Grignard reagents are RMgX, where R is an organic group. So Mg is part of X.

So, if X is a Grignard reagent, then it's a metal (like Mg) and an organic group. So the constituent elements would be Mg and perhaps C, H, O, etc., depending on the organic part.

But the problem says X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. So if X is Mg-based, then maybe it's using a heavier isotope than the common one. Mg usually has isotopes like 24Mg, 25Mg, 26Mg. The common isotope is 24Mg (about 78.99% abundance). So a heavier isotope would be 25Mg or 26Mg.

So back to the reaction: X reacts with liquid Y. Grignard reagents react with various things, like water, alcohols, etc. If Y is water, then Grignard would react violently, perhaps. But Grignard reactions are usually done under anhydrous conditions because they react with water to produce hydrogen gas (H2) and Mg(OH)2.

Wait, but earlier I thought W might be O2 or N2, but if W is H2, then the number of protons and neutrons in the molecule would be 2*(1) protons and 0 neutrons, which isn't equal. So that doesn't fit. So perhaps Y isn't water, but something else.

Wait, another thought: If Y is a carboxylic acid, but that's a liquid. Alternatively, maybe Y is an acid like H2SO4, but that's more of a liquid. No, wait, Grignard reagents react with acids.

Wait, perhaps Y is a ketone, but that's a liquid as well. Alternatively, perhaps Y is a carbonyl compound.

But wait, the product of X and a keto acid contains 2 oxygen atoms. So, when a Grignard (like R-Mg-X) reacts with a keto acid (like RCOOH), the Grignard would add twice to the carbonyl, perhaps forming a tertiary alcohol.

Wait, no. Let me think. A Grignard reagent typically adds to a carbonyl group once, giving an alcohol after workup. But if the keto acid has two carbonyl groups, perhaps the Grignard adds twice. Alternatively, maybe the keto acid is something like a diketone.

Wait, perhaps the product is a secondary alcohol. Let me imagine: R-Mg-X reacts with a ketone (like acetone) to form an alcohol. But the question says the product of the reaction with a keto acid contains 2 oxygen atoms. Wait, a keto acid has a ketone group and a carboxylic acid group. So when Grignard adds to the ketone part, perhaps the product would be a secondary alcohol.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to approach this differently.

The precipitate G, when heated, releases B. So perhaps G is a hydroxide, and when heated, it decomposes. For example, if G is magnesium hydroxide, when heated, it might decompose into magnesium oxide and water. But that doesn't release a solid B, but rather MgO and H2O (vapor). Alternatively, if G is something like a carbonate, heating might release CO2.

Alternatively, if G is a sulfide, heating might release H2S, but that's a gas, not a solid B.

Wait, another possibility: G is a carbonate, perhaps, and heating it releases CO2 and leaves behind a metal oxide. But then B would be a metal oxide, but what's the melting point of that?

Alternatively, G could be a hydroxide that, upon heating, loses water and becomes an oxide. For example, Mg(OH)2 decomposes upon heating to form MgO and H2O. But again, that's a liquid (water) and solid (MgO). So B would be MgO, which has a melting point of around 2800°C, which is way higher than 277 K (which is about 4°C). So that doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe G is a different compound. Let me think. What if G is something like barium sulfate precipitate, but that doesn't release anything upon heating. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps G is a carbonate, like Na2CO3·10H2O, which, when heated, loses water and becomes anhydrous Na2CO3, but that's still a solid. Doesn't fit the melting point.

Wait, maybe the precipitate is something else. Let me think about the initial reaction. X reacts with Y to produce gas W, precipitate G, and possibly another product.

If X is a Grignard reagent, such as Mg-based, then Y could be something like an acid. Let's say Y is H2O. Then Grignard would react with water to produce H2 gas (but earlier that didn't fit W's conditions) and Mg(OH)2 precipitate.

But earlier analysis suggested that W can't be H2 because it doesn't satisfy the same number of protons and neutrons in the molecule. H2 has 2 protons, 0 neutrons. So that's 2 vs 0: no, that doesn't satisfy the condition. So maybe W isn't H2.

Alternatively, perhaps W is CO2, but then in that case, each CO2 molecule has 12 protons (C:6, O:8 *2) and 12 neutrons (C:6, O:8 *2). So total protons: 12, total neutrons: 12. That fits the condition. So W could be CO2.

But how would that happen? If X is a Grignard reagent and reacts with Y, which is perhaps a carbonate. Wait, but Grignard reagents are strong bases and would react with carbonates. Let me think about that.

If Y is a carbonate, like Na2CO3, and X is a Grignard reagent (like Mg-based), then reacting them might produce CO2 gas.

Wait, but Grignard reagents typically don't react with carbonates in a way that releases CO2. Instead, Grignard would react with CO3^2- to form MgCO3 or something else, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe Y is a carbon-containing compound. Let me think about other possibilities.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a halogenated compound. For example, if Y is CCl4, but that's a liquid. If X is a Grignard, then adding it to CCl4 might not produce gas. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the product when X reacts with a keto acid. The product contains 2 oxygen atoms. So the product is probably an alcohol because Grignard adds to a ketone to form an alcohol.

Wait, but a keto acid is like R-CO-COOH. So when the Grignard adds, it would add twice to the carbonyl group, perhaps leading to a secondary alcohol, but I'm not sure about the exact product.

Alternatively, perhaps the product of the Grignard and keto acid is a tertiary alcohol, which would have more oxygen atoms. But the question says the product contains 2 oxygen atoms. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the product is a primary alcohol, which has one oxygen in the hydroxyl group. But the problem says 2 oxygen atoms. So perhaps the product has two oxygen atoms in the molecule. Like maybe an ether? No, Grignard usually doesn't form ethers with acids.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a diol, but that would require two Grignard additions, which might not be the case.

Hmm. Maybe I'm approaching this the wrong way. Let me try to think about the elements present in X. Since X is a Grignard reagent, it's likely to contain Mg. Additionally, the organic part could have C, H, etc. But the heavier isotope is in one of the constituent elements.

So the elements in X are Mg, C, H. But maybe more. Wait, Grignard reagents are organomagnesium compounds. So the structure is R-Mg-X, where R is an alkyl or aryl group, and X is a halogen (like Cl, Br, I).

So the constituent elements of X are Mg, the organic group's elements (like C, H), and the halogen (like Cl).

So, the elements in X are C, H, Mg, and Cl (if X is R-Mg-Cl, for example).

Now, the problem says to calculate the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present in X.

So, in X, which elements are present? Let's say Mg, C, H, Cl.

The lightest element would be H (atomic number 1), and the heaviest would be Cl (atomic number 17). Or if X uses a heavier halogen like Br (35), then Br would be heavier than Cl.

Wait, but the problem says the heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. So perhaps X uses a heavier isotope of Mg, or a heavier halogen.

Wait, for example, if X is CH3MgBr, then the elements are C, H, Mg, Br. So the lightest element is H, the heaviest is Br (atomic number 35.45). So the cumulative atomic masses would be H (1.007) and Br (79.904), summing to approximately 80.911.

But wait, looking at the options, the choices are 25, 29, 31, 35. So 80.9 isn't one of the options. So perhaps my assumption is wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the heaviest element in X is Cl, which has an atomic mass around 35.45. So H's atomic mass is 1.007, Cl is 35.45. Sum is about 36.457, which is close to option C) 31 or D) 29. Hmm, that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps the heaviest element is Mg. Let me think: Mg has an atomic mass around 24.305. So the lightest element (H) is 1.007, heaviest is Mg (24.305). Sum is 25.312, which is close to option B) 25 or A)35.

Wait, but that's only if the heaviest element is Mg. But in a Grignard reagent, the halogen is heavier than Mg. So perhaps I'm wrong about the elements.

Wait, another possibility: maybe X is a different kind of reagent. Let's think about other reagents used in organic chemistry. Perhaps it's a metal such as lithium, sodium, or something else.

Wait, another thought: Maybe X is a sodium-based reagent, like sodium metal. Sodium reacts violently with water, producing H2 gas. But earlier, we thought W is H2, which doesn't fit the proton and neutron condition.

Wait, but in that case, the gas W would be H2. The molecule H2 has 2 protons (2) and 0 neutrons. So 2 protons and 0 neutrons: not equal. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm.

Wait, let's think about another possibility where the gas W is CO2. So the reaction between X and Y produces CO2. That would mean Y contains carbonate or some carbon source. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: The precipitate G, when heated, releases B. If B has a melting point near 277 K (about 4°C), what could that be? Well, water freezes at 273 K (0°C), so 277 K is about 4°C. So perhaps B is a solid that's just above freezing. Maybe it's a solid with a low melting point, like some organic compound. Alternatively, perhaps B is something like ammonium chloride, which has a melting point around 337 K, which is higher. So that's not it.

Wait, another thought: Maybe B is a solid formed from a reaction, like a salt that crystallizes at around 4°C. For example, maybe something like sodium nitrate or another salt that has a low melting point.

Alternatively, perhaps B is a hydrate that loses water upon heating, but that doesn't fit the melting point.

Alternatively, maybe B is a basic carbonate. For example, magnesium carbonate has a melting point around 900°C, which is way higher.

Hmm, this is getting a bit tricky. Let me try to approach the problem from the product of X and the keto acid.

The product has two oxygen atoms. Suppose X is a Grignard reagent, which adds to the carbonyl group of the keto acid. Let's say the keto acid is something like acetoacetic acid (CH3COCOOH). Reacting this with a Grignard reagent (like CH3MgBr) would add the organometallic part to the carbonyl carbon. Since the keto acid has two carbonyl groups, perhaps the Grignard would add to one of them, producing an alcohol.

Wait, but the product would have more oxygen atoms. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a secondary alcohol, which has one hydroxyl group (O). But the problem says two oxygen atoms in the product. So maybe the product has an additional oxygen elsewhere.

Wait, maybe the product is an alcohol with another functional group. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction between X and the keto acid forms a ketone and a carboxylic acid, but that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps the product is a diol, but that would require two additions of the Grignard, which might not be the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is an ester or another compound, but I'm not certain.

Hmm, maybe I should think about the possible isotopes in X. X incorporates a heavier isotope. So, for example, if X is MgCl2, but that's not a Grignard reagent. Wait, Grignard reagents are R-Mg-X, such as CH3MgBr.

So the elements in X are C, H, Mg, Br.

Wait, but Br has an atomic mass around 80, and Mg is about 24.3. So the lightest element is H, and the heaviest is Br. So their atomic masses would be 1.007 (H) and 79.904 (Br), sum is about 80.911. The options don't have this, so perhaps I'm wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps X doesn't contain Br but Cl. Then the heaviest element would be Cl (35.45). So H (1.007) and Cl (35.45) sum to about 36.457. Still not matching any options.

Wait, maybe the elements are Mg and Cl, but another element is present. Alternatively, perhaps X contains oxygen. But Grignard reagents don't have O, unless it's an ether, which I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about the melting point of B. 277 K is 4°C. So B is a solid that melts just above 0°C. What compounds have such a melting point? Maybe something like ammonium nitrate, but its melting point is around 169°C. No. Alternatively, maybe it's a hydrate. For example, calcium nitrate tetrahydrate has a melting point of about 20°C. Hmm, that's close. So if B is calcium nitrate, perhaps.

But then, how would that fit into the reaction?

Wait, perhaps G is a carbonate, and when heated, it releases CO2 and leaves behind a metal oxide. So if G is MgCO3, heating it would produce MgO and CO2. But MgO has a high melting point, so that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, if G is a hydroxide. For example, Mg(OH)2 has a melting point around 1000°C, which is way higher than 277 K.

Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this the wrong way. Let me try to think of possible substances for X, Y, W, G, B.

If W is CO2, then Y must be a carbonate. So when X reacts with Y, which is a carbonate, perhaps it displaces CO2.

Wait, if X is a Grignard reagent, it would react with carbonate to form MgCO3, but that's solid, not a precipitate. Alternatively, maybe Y is a bicarbonate, which would release CO2 upon reaction with a base.

Wait, but Grignard reagents are strong bases. So if Y is NaHCO3 (sodium bicarbonate), reacting with a Grignard reagent would produce CO2 gas. The reaction would be:

R-Mg-X + NaHCO3 → RCO2- (but that's not correct, as Grignard would deprotonate HCO3^-).

Wait, but perhaps it's more accurate to think that Grignard reagents can deprotonate bicarbonate, releasing CO2.

So, in that case, the reaction would produce CO2 gas (W), and the precipitate G would be the magnesium salt, perhaps Mg(HCO3)2? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a carbonate, and X is a Grignard. Let's imagine:

R-Mg-X + Na2CO3 → RCOO^- + MgCO3 ↓ + ... ?

Wait, but I'm not certain about this reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a carboxylic acid, and X is a Grignard. They would react to form an alcohol. But that doesn't produce gas W.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the options again.

The options are A)35, B)25, C)31, D)29.

When the problem says to calculate the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X. So sum the atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X.

If X is a Grignard reagent like CH3MgBr, the elements are C, H, Mg, Br.

The lightest is H (1.007), the heaviest is Br (79.904). Sum is approx 80.911, but that's not an option.

If the heaviest is Cl (35.45), sum would be 36.457, not an option.

If X has elements like Mg and C, sum would be 24.305 (Mg) + 12.01 (C) = 36.315, not matching.

Wait, another possibility: X is a diatomic molecule, maybe something like O2 or N2, but that doesn't fit the violent reaction with Y.

Wait, perhaps X is something like KMnO4, but that's a strong oxidizing agent and not a Grignard.

Wait, perhaps X is a heavy metal like mercury, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: X is a metal that forms a precipitate. Let's think, perhaps X is barium oxide or something. Wait, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is something like sodium, which reacts with water to produce H2 gas. But as we saw earlier, H2 doesn't fit the W condition.

Wait, another angle: The gas W's molecule has the same number of protons and neutrons. Let me think of all possible diatomic or triatomic gases and their proton and neutron counts.

For diatomic gases:

- O2: each O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons (assuming 16O). So molecule has 16 protons and 16 neutrons. So same number.

- N2: each N has 7p and 7n (14N). So molecule has 14p and 14n.

- Cl2: each Cl has 17p and 35n (35Cl). So each Cl has 17p and 18n (wait, 35Cl has 17p and 18n). So for Cl2, 34p and 36n. Not equal.

Wait, 35Cl: atomic number 17, so 17 protons, and atomic mass ~35, so 35-17=18 neutrons. So for Cl2, 34p (2*17) and 36n (2*18). Not equal.

So W can't be Cl2.

- F2: each F has 9p and 9n (assuming 19F). So F2: 18p and 18n. So same number. So W could be F2.

Wait, if W is F2, then the reaction between X and Y produces F2 gas.

But F2 is a diatomic gas with 18 protons and 18 neutrons per molecule.

So what reaction produces F2?

Hmm, perhaps X is a fluorine-containing compound and Y is something else. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a metal that, when reacted with Y, releases F2. But metals typically don't release F2 upon reaction with other substances unless it's a specific reaction.

Wait, perhaps Y is a fluoride salt, and X is a strong reducing agent that causes the release of F2. But I'm not familiar with such a reaction.

Alternatively, maybe X is a fluorine isotope, but that seems unlikely.

Hmm, perhaps W is O2 or N2. Let's consider O2 again.

If W is O2, then the reaction between X and Y produces O2 gas. So what produces O2 upon reaction? Decomposition of peroxides, perhaps.

Wait, if X is a peroxide, and Y is an acid, perhaps the reaction would produce O2. For example, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) decomposes to produce O2 under certain conditions.

But I'm not sure how that fits with the other parts of the question.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a metal, and Y is an acid, producing H2 gas. But earlier that didn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a carbonate, and X is a metal, producing CO2.

Wait, another angle: The product of X and a keto acid has two oxygen atoms. Suppose that product is a diol, which has two hydroxyl groups. Each hydroxyl has one O, so that would be two O's. But that's in the molecule, not the entire product.

Wait, maybe the product is a secondary alcohol, which has one -OH group, but perhaps the molecule also has another O elsewhere, like a ketone or ester group.

This is getting complicated. Maybe I should try to make a table of possible elements and their atomic masses.

If the options are 25, 29, 31, 35, the sum is likely from adding two elements. So perhaps the elements are Mg (24.3) and another element with mass around 1 (H), but that gives 25.3, which is near option B) 25.

Wait, Mg is about 24.3, and H is about 1.007. Sum is about 25.3. So option B is 25.

If X contains Mg and H, perhaps as in H2O or something else. Wait, but X is a reagent in organic chemistry. So maybe X is Mg in a compound, and the other elements are H and O.

Wait, but then the heaviest element would be Mg, and the lightest H. Sum is about 25.3, which is close to option B.

So perhaps the correct answer is B)25.

Wait, but earlier I thought the heaviest element would be Cl or Br, but if X doesn't contain those, perhaps it's Mg and H.

Wait, another thought: If X is a magnesium-based reagent, such as magnesium metal, then the elements present are Mg and the other elements in Y. But in X, the constituent elements would be Mg and whatever is in the organometallic part.

Wait, but if X is pure Mg metal, then the elements are Mg and H if it's Mg in a compound with H, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, if X is a Grignard reagent without halogen, but that's not possible because Grignards are organometallic with Mg and a halogen.

Hmm, perhaps I should conclude that the sum is around 25, so option B.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves identifying the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in Substance X, which is described as a reagent in organic chemistry. Key clues include:

1. **Gas W**: The molecule of W has the same number of protons and neutrons. This suggests W could be O₂, N₂, or F₂, as these molecules satisfy the condition of equal protons and neutrons in the molecule.

2. **Precipitate G and Product B**: G forms during the reaction and releases B upon heating. B has a melting point close to 277 K (4°C), indicating it is a solid with a low melting point.

3. **Reaction with a Keto Acid**: The product of X and a keto acid contains 2 oxygen atoms, suggesting X reacts with the keto acid to form a compound with two oxygen atoms, possibly an alcohol or related product.

4. **Substance X**: X is described as a reagent in organic chemistry, likely a Grignard reagent (e.g., RMgX). Grignard reagents typically contain magnesium (Mg), carbon (C), hydrogen (H), and a halogen (e.g., Cl or Br).

### Analysis of Elements in X:
- The lightest element in X is likely hydrogen (H), with an atomic mass of approximately 1.007.
- The heaviest element in X could be magnesium (Mg) or a halogen (e.g., Cl or Br). Magnesium has an atomic mass of ~24.305, while chlorine (Cl) has an atomic mass of ~35.45, and bromine (Br) has an atomic mass of ~79.904.

### Cumulative Atomic Mass:
- If the lightest element is H (1.007) and the heaviest is Mg (24.305), their cumulative atomic mass is approximately \( 1.007 + 24.305 = 25.312 \), which is close to option B (25).
- If the heaviest element were Cl (35.45), the cumulative atomic mass would be \( 1.007 + 35.45 = 36.457 \), which does not match any of the given options.

Given the options provided and the reasoning above, the most plausible cumulative atomic mass of the lightest and heaviest elements in X is **25**.

Answer: B
