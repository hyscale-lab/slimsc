Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about pion decay. Let me try to think through it step by step. I remember that pions are subatomic particles, and they can decay into other particles. The question is about a positively charged pion (Pi+) decaying into a muon (mu+) and a neutrino (nu). The pion is initially stationary, which probably means it's at rest, so the total momentum before decay is zero. 

The problem gives me the rest masses: the pion's rest mass is 139.6 MeV, and the muon's rest mass is 105.7 MeV. Wait, but what about the neutrino? Neutrinos are super light, almost massless, right? So I think in this case, the neutrino's mass can be neglected compared to the others. That should simplify things a bit.

The question is asking for the kinetic energies of the product particles. So I need to find the kinetic energies of the muon and the neutrino. Since the pion is at rest, the total momentum of the products must be zero because momentum is conserved. That means the muon and neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta.

Hmm, but how do I approach this? I remember that in particle decay problems, energy and momentum conservation are key. So let's write down the conservation equations.

Energy conservation: the total energy before decay equals the total energy after. The pion's rest energy is its mass energy, so E_initial = m_pi c² = 139.6 MeV. After decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and neutrino. So E_mu + E_nu = 139.6 MeV.

Momentum conservation: since the pion is at rest, the total momentum of the products must be zero. So the magnitudes of the momenta of mu and nu must be equal and opposite, meaning |p_mu| = |p_nu|.

But wait, the neutrino's mass is negligible, so its momentum is roughly equal to its energy, since for massless particles, E = |p|c. So E_nu ≈ |p_nu| c. Similarly, for the muon, E_mu is its kinetic energy plus its rest mass energy. So E_mu = sqrt( (p_mu c)^2 + (m_mu c²)^2 ). 

Since |p_mu| = |p_nu| = p, let's let p be the magnitude of momentum for both. So E_nu = p c (approximately, since its mass is negligible). And E_mu = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c²)^2 ). 

Putting it all together into the energy equation: sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c²)^2 ) + p c = m_pi c².

Let me write that equation more simply, factoring out c² where possible. Let's denote everything in terms of MeV, so setting c=1 in natural units (since E=mc², so we can ignore c in the units here). Then:

sqrt( p² + m_mu² ) + p = m_pi.

Wait, but substituting the given masses: m_mu = 105.7 MeV, m_pi = 139.6 MeV.

So the equation is sqrt(p² + (105.7)^2 ) + p = 139.6.

Hmm, that's a bit tricky to solve. Let me rearrange the equation to solve for p. Let me denote sqrt(p² + (105.7)^2 ) = 139.6 - p.

Now, square both sides to eliminate the square root:

p² + (105.7)^2 = (139.6 - p)^2.

Expanding the right side: (139.6)^2 - 2*139.6 p + p².

Subtract p² from both sides: (105.7)^2 = (139.6)^2 - 2*139.6 p.

Let me compute the squares:

(105.7)^2 = approx 11171 (because 100^2=10000, 105^2=11025, 105.7^2 is a bit higher).

139.6^2 = approximately 19488 (since 140^2 is 19600, so 139.6 is a bit less: 139.6² = (140 -0.4)^2 = 140² - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4² = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19488.16.

So substituting into the equation:

11171.49 ≈ 19488.16 - 2*139.6 p.

Wait, but wait, let me be precise with calculations. Let me compute 105.7^2 exactly:

105.7 * 105.7: 100*100 = 10,000; 100*5.7=570; 5.7*100=570; 5.7*5.7=32.49. So 10,000 + 570 +570 +32.49 = 11,172.49.

And 139.6^2: (140 - 0.4)^2 = 140^2 - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4^2 = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19488.16.

So the equation becomes:

11172.49 = 19488.16 - 279.2 p.

Wait, because 2*139.6 = 279.2.

So moving 19488.16 to the left: 11172.49 - 19488.16 = -279.2 p.

Calculating 11172.49 - 19488.16: Let me subtract.

19488.16 - 11172.49 = 8315.67. So the left side is negative: -8315.67 = -279.2 p.

Multiply both sides by -1: 8315.67 = 279.2 p.

So p = 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ Let's compute that.

Dividing 8315.67 by 279.2.

Hmm, 279.2 * 30 = 8376, which is a bit more than 8315. So 29.8, perhaps.

Wait, 279.2 * 29.8 = ?

Wait, 279.2 *30 is 8376. So 29.8 is 30 - 0.2.

So 279.2 *29.8 = 279.2*(30) - 279.2*(0.2) = 8376 - 55.84 = 8320.16.

Wait, but our numerator is 8315.67, which is a bit less than 8320.16. So maybe the actual p is approximately 29.8 - a little bit.

Let me compute 8315.67 / 279.2.

Compute 279.2 * x = 8315.67.

Let me try x=29.8.

As above, 279.2 *29.8=8320.16, which is 4.49 more than 8315.67. So we need x a bit less than 29.8.

The difference is 8320.16 -8315.67 =4.49.

So, per 279.2 per unit x, so 4.49 / 279.2 ≈ 0.016.

So x ≈29.8 -0.016=29.784.

So p≈29.784 MeV/c.

Wait, but that's the magnitude of the momentum for both the muon and neutrino.

Wait, but wait, the unit for momentum is MeV/c, right? Because in natural units, c is incorporated. So p is 29.784 MeV/c.

But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check the equation.

Wait the equation after squaring was:

p² + (105.7)^2 = (139.6 - p)^2.

Which expanded to p² + (105.7)^2 = (139.6)^2 - 2*139.6 p + p².

Subtract p²: 105.7^2 = (139.6)^2 -2*139.6 p.

Then, moving all to one side: 2*139.6 p = (139.6)^2 - (105.7)^2.

Wait, wait a second, I think I might have miscalculated earlier. Because 105.7^2 is 11,172.49, and 139.6^2 is 19,488.16.

So 139.6^2 - 105.7^2 = 19,488.16 -11,172.49 = 8,315.67.

So 2*139.6 p = 8315.67.

So p = 8315.67 / (2*139.6) = 8315.67 / 279.2 = 29.784 MeV/c.

So p is approximately 29.784 MeV/c.

Now, with p known, we can find the energy of the muon and the neutrino.

E_mu = sqrt( p^2 + (m_mu)^2 ) = sqrt( (29.784)^2 + (105.7)^2 ).

Let me compute (29.784)^2: approximately 29.784 *29.784 ≈ 887 (because 30^2=900, so 29.784 is a bit less, so around 887).

Wait, 29.784^2 = ?

Let me compute it:

29.784 *29.784 = (30 - 0.216)^2 = 30^2 - 2*30*0.216 + (0.216)^2.

= 900 - 12.96 + 0.046656 = 887.086656.

And 105.7^2 = 11,172.49.

So adding 887.086656 +11,172.49 = 12,059.576656.

Take the square root: sqrt(12059.576656) ≈ 109.813 MeV.

Wait, because 109.8^2 is about 12056.04 (since 100^2=10,000, 10^2=100, 0.8^2=0.64; 109.8^2 = (100+9.8)^2 = 100^2 + 2*100*9.8 +9.8^2= 10000 + 1960 + 96.04= 11,960 +96.04= 12,056.04. Hmm, but our number is 12,059.576656, which is a bit higher. So sqrt(12059.576656)= approximately 109.8 + (12,059.576656 - 12,056.04) / (2*109.8).

The difference is 3.536656. Divided by (2*109.8)=219.6.

So 3.536656 /219.6 ≈ 0.0161.

So approx 109.8 +0.0161=109.816 MeV.

So E_mu ≈ 109.816 MeV.

Then, E_nu = p*c ≈ 29.784 MeV (since for the neutrino, mass is negligible, so E ≈ pc).

So the energies are E_mu ≈109.816 MeV and E_nu≈29.784 MeV.

Wait, but wait, the total energy from these should add up to the pion's energy, which is 139.6 MeV. Let's check: 109.816 +29.784=139.600 MeV. Yep, that adds up correctly.

Now, the kinetic energy is the total energy minus the rest mass energy. So for the muon, KE_mu = E_mu - m_mu c² = 109.816 - 105.7 =4.116 MeV. Approximately 4.12 MeV.

The neutrino's kinetic energy is the same as its energy, since its rest mass is negligible. So KE_nu = E_nu - 0 =29.784 MeV.

Wait, looking at the options:

Option D is 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV. That looks to match.

But wait, let me think again. The neutrino's kinetic energy is approximately 29.8 MeV, and the muon's is about 4.12 MeV. So option D is the correct answer.

To determine the kinetic energies of the muon (mu⁺) and neutrino (nu) in the decay of a stationary pion (Pi⁺) into mu⁺ and nu, we use energy and momentum conservation principles. The rest masses of the pion and muon are given as 139.6 MeV and 105.7 MeV, respectively. The neutrino is assumed to be massless.

### Conservation Equations
1. **Energy Conservation**:  
   The total energy before decay is the pion's rest energy, \( E_{\text{initial}} = m_{\pi} c^2 = 139.6 \, \text{MeV} \). After decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and neutrino:  
   \[
   E_{\mu} + E_{\nu} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]

2. **Momentum Conservation**:  
   Since the pion is stationary, the total momentum of the products must be zero. Thus, the magnitudes of the momenta of the muon and neutrino are equal and opposite:  
   \[
   |p_{\mu}| = |p_{\nu}| = p.
   \]

### Energy of the Neutrino
For the neutrino, since its mass is negligible, its energy is approximately equal to its momentum:  
\[
E_{\nu} = p c \approx p.
\]

### Energy of the Muon
The muon's energy is given by the relativistic energy formula:  
\[
E_{\mu} = \sqrt{(p c)^2 + (m_{\mu} c^2)^2}.
\]

### Solving for Momentum \( p \)
Substituting \( E_{\mu} \) and \( E_{\nu} \) into the energy conservation equation:  
\[
\sqrt{p^2 + (105.7)^2} + p = 139.6.
\]

Let \( \sqrt{p^2 + (105.7)^2} = 139.6 - p \). Squaring both sides:  
\[
p^2 + (105.7)^2 = (139.6 - p)^2.
\]

Expanding and simplifying:  
\[
p^2 + 11172.49 = 19488.16 - 279.2 p + p^2.
\]

Canceling \( p^2 \):  
\[
11172.49 = 19488.16 - 279.2 p.
\]

Rearranging:  
\[
279.2 p = 19488.16 - 11172.49.
\]

\[
p = \frac{8315.67}{279.2} \approx 29.784 \, \text{MeV}/c.
\]

### Energies of the Muon and Neutrino
1. **Muon's Energy**:  
   \[
   E_{\mu} = \sqrt{p^2 + (105.7)^2}.
   \]

   Substituting \( p = 29.784 \):  
   \[
   E_{\mu} = \sqrt{(29.784)^2 + (105.7)^2}.
   \]

   Compute \( (29.784)^2 \approx 887.09 \) and \( (105.7)^2 = 11172.49 \):  
   \[
   E_{\mu} = \sqrt{887.09 + 11172.49} = \sqrt{12059.58} \approx 109.816 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]

2. **Neutrino's Energy**:  
   \[
   E_{\nu} = p \approx 29.784 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]

### Kinetic Energies
The kinetic energy of each particle is its total energy minus its rest energy (if any):  
1. **Muon's Kinetic Energy**:  
   \[
   KE_{\mu} = E_{\mu} - m_{\mu} c^2 = 109.816 - 105.7 = 4.116 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]

2. **Neutrino's Kinetic Energy**:  
   \[
   KE_{\nu} = E_{\nu} \approx 29.784 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]

### Final Answer
The kinetic energies of the muon and neutrino are approximately **4.12 MeV** and **29.8 MeV**, respectively. This matches **Option D**.
