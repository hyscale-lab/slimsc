Okay, so I have this astronomy question here, and I need to figure out how the number of stars changes with distance based on the given relationship. Hmm, let's think about this.

The question says that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. So, number of stars N ∝ 1/plx^5. Oh wait, right, parallax (plx) is inversely related to distance. Because parallax is 1 over distance in parsecs, I think. So plx = 1/d, where d is the distance.

So if plx is inversely proportional to d, then 1/plx would be proportional to d. Let me write that down. So N is proportional to 1/plx^5, which is the same as (1/plx)^5. But since plx = 1/d, then 1/plx is d. So substituting that in, N ∝ d^5.

Wait, no, wait a second. Let me clarify this. If N ∝ 1/(plx)^5, and plx is 1/d, then plx = d^-1. So 1/plx is d. So (1/plx)^5 is d^5. So N is proportional to d^5. That means as distance increases, the number of stars increases to the fifth power of distance.

But wait, the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance. Oh, right, so it's the differential—like, how does N change as r increases by a small amount dr? So I think we need to consider the derivative of N with respect to r, or maybe the rate of change with distance.

Alternatively, maybe it's about the number density per unit volume. Wait, no, the question says per unit range of distance, which sounds like it's the change in number per unit distance, not per unit volume. Hmm, not exactly sure. Let me think.

Wait, the number of stars in a region might depend on the volume of that region. Because the more volume, the more stars you can have, assuming a certain density. The volume of a spherical shell at radius r with thickness dr is 4πr² dr. So the number of stars would be proportional to the volume, which is r² dr.

But in this case, the number isn't directly proportional to r². Instead, it's proportional to d^5, where d is distance. Wait, but that might be the case for a certain density profile.

Wait, let's think again. The given relation is N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Since plx = 1/d, then N ∝ d^5.

So N is proportional to d^5. So if I have a region of the sky and I look at stars at distance d, the number of stars is proportional to d^5.

But the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance. So per unit range, which I think refers to the number of stars per unit distance, that is, the gradient or the slope of N with respect to r.

Wait, but if N is proportional to d^5, then dN/dr would be proportional to 5d^4. So that's the rate of change of number with distance. So for each unit increase in r, the number increases by 5r^4. So the rate is proportional to r^4.

Wait, but what's the question exactly asking? It says, "how does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?" So per unit increase in r, how does N change. So that would be the derivative, dN/dr.

So if N ∝ d^5, then dN/dd = 5d^4. So the change in N per unit change in d is proportional to d^4. So that's the rate.

Looking back at the options, the options are about how the number changes with distance, so the rate would be like r^4. So looking at the options, option C is r^4.

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure I'm not mixing up anything. The number of stars in a region of the sky with a certain parallax dependence. Oh, another point to consider: in astronomy, sometimes when you look at a region of the sky, you're considering a thin slice, and the number of stars in that slice depends on the distance. But in this case, the relation is given as N ∝ 1/(plx)^5.

Alternatively, perhaps it's about the number of stars per unit area per distance. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: the number of stars per unit area (surface density) at a distance d is usually proportional to d^2, because the area is 4πd², so if you have a volume element, it's 4πd² dd. But in this case, the number is varying as 1/(plx)^5, which is d^5. So N is proportional to d^5.

Wait, perhaps I should write the relation more formally.

Given N ∝ 1/(plx)^5.

And plx = 1/d, so plx = d^{-1}.

So 1/plx = d.

So 1/(plx)^5 = d^5.

So N = k d^5, where k is a constant of proportionality.

So N is proportional to d^5.

Now, the question is about how N changes with distance. So what is dN/dr? Because that would tell you how many more stars you get per unit increase in r.

dN/dr = d(k d^5)/dr = 5k d^4.

So as r increases, the rate of change of N with r is proportional to r^4. So the number of stars increases as r^4 per unit distance. So the answer would be option C, which is ~ r^4.

The question states that the number of stars, \( N \), varies with parallax as \( N \propto 1/\text{plx}^5 \). Parallax (\( \text{plx} \)) is inversely proportional to distance (\( d \)), such that \( \text{plx} = 1/d \). Substituting this into the given relationship, \( N \propto (1/\text{plx})^5 \) becomes \( N \propto d^5 \). This means the number of stars increases with the fifth power of distance.

The question asks how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance (\( r \)). This requires finding the derivative of \( N \) with respect to \( r \), which represents the rate of change of \( N \) as \( r \) increases. Starting with \( N \propto d^5 \), the derivative is:

\[
\frac{dN}{dr} \propto 5d^4.
\]

Thus, the rate of change of the number of stars with distance is proportional to \( r^4 \). Among the given options, the correct answer is \( \sim r^4 \).
