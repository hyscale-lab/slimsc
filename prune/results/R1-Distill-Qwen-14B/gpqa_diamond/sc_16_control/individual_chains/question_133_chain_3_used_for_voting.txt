Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. Let me read it again. 

The question says that we have a solution with a volume of 200.00 cm³, which is 200 mL. It contains 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O. The molecular weights are given: 136.09 g/mol for KH2PO4 and 177.99 g/mol for Na2HPO4·2H2O. The temperature is 25°C. We need to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions (HPO4^2-) in the solution. The Ka values for H3PO4 are provided: Ka1 is 7.5e-3, Ka2 is 6.2e-8, and Ka3 is 1.8e-12.

Hmm. So, orthophosphate is HPO4^2- right? Wait, no, wait. Because H3PO4 is phosphoric acid. It dissociates stepwise:

H3PO4 ↔ H+ + H2PO4^- (Ka1)
H2PO4^- ↔ H+ + HPO4^2- (Ka2)
HPO4^2- ↔ H+ + PO4^3- (Ka3)

So, orthophosphate is HPO4^2-? Or is it H2PO4^-? Wait, I think sometimes the terms can be confusing. Oh wait, orthophosphate usually refers to the HPO4^2- ion. But sometimes people might refer to H2PO4^- as dihydrogen phosphate. Wait, let me think. I think HPO4^2- is the hydrogen phosphate ion, and PO4^3- is the orthophosphate. Or maybe I'm getting this mixed up. Alternatively, perhaps orthophosphate is H3PO4, and the polyatomic ions are called something else. Wait, perhaps I should double-check. No, I think I'm right. HPO4^2- is often called hydrogen phosphate, and PO4^3- is orthophosphate. Hmm, but the question asks for orthophosphate ions, which I think refers to PO4^3-? Or wait, no, wait. Maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: the problem gives us KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. So, the first compound is potassium dihydrogen phosphate, which dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^-.

The second compound is sodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate. So, Na2HPO4·2H2O would dissociate into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2-.

So, in solution, we have H2PO4^- from KH2PO4 and HPO4^2- from Na2HPO4·2H2O. Now, the question is asking for the concentration of HPO4^2- ions, which is what this solution contributes. But wait, because in solution, these ions can interconvert via the acid dissociation. So, perhaps some of the H2PO4^- will deprotonate to form HPO4^2-, and some HPO4^2- will protonate to form H2PO4^-.

Wait, but in this case, we're adding both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- into the solution. So, they form a buffer solution. The pH of the solution will determine the ratio of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

But wait, the question is only asking for the concentration of orthophosphate ions. Hmm, but which one is orthophosphate? Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the total concentration of HPO4^2- plus any that might be converted from H2PO4^-.

Wait, no. I think I might be getting the terms wrong. Let me think again. HPO4^2- is hydrogen phosphate, and PO4^3- is orthophosphate. So, the question is about HPO4^2-? Or is it PO4^3-?

Wait, the problem says 'orthophosphate ions'. Orthophosphate is the fully deprotonated form, PO4^3-? Or is it HPO4^2-? I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me look it up (but since I can't, I have to think). I recall that orthophosphate refers to the PO4^3- form. So, the question is asking for the concentration of PO4^3-.

Wait, but in the solution, we have both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- added. So, perhaps the HPO4^2- can further deprotonate to form PO4^3-.

So, the overall approach would be:

1. Calculate the concentrations of each salt in the solution.
2. Determine the pH of the solution, which can be found using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation since we have a buffer solution.
3. Use the pH to find the concentration of PO4^3-.

Alternatively, perhaps the solution is using the third dissociation constant to find the concentration of PO4^3- from HPO4^2-.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about the ions present. KH2PO4 dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^- (dihydrogen phosphate). Na2HPO4·2H2O dissociates into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- (hydrogen phosphate). So, in solution, we have H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

These two can interconvert via the second dissociation step:

H2PO4^- ↔ H+ + HPO4^2- (Ka2 = 6.2e-8)

So, the solution is a buffer solution involving H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

To find the concentration of PO4^3-, which is the deprotonated form of HPO4^2-, we can consider the third dissociation, which is:

HPO4^2- ↔ H+ + PO4^3- (Ka3 = 1.8e-12)

So, the concentration of PO4^3- would be based on the concentration of HPO4^2- and the Ka3 value.

But first, let's find the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- in the original solution.

The solution volume is 200 mL (0.2 L).

For KH2PO4:

Mass = 1.00 g.
Molar mass = 136.09 g/mol.

Moles = 1.00 / 136.09 ≈ 0.007343 mol.

This gives 0.007343 mol of H2PO4^-.

For Na2HPO4·2H2O:

Mass = 1.00 g.
Molar mass = 177.99 g/mol.

Moles = 1.00 / 177.99 ≈ 0.005614 mol.

This gives 0.005614 mol of HPO4^2-.

So, the concentrations are:

[H2PO4^-] = 0.007343 / 0.2 = 0.036715 M
[HPO4^2-] = 0.005614 / 0.2 = 0.02807 M

Now, since H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- are in solution, they form a buffer. We can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH:

pH = pKa2 + log ([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-])

pKa2 = -log(6.2e-8) ≈ 7.207.

So,

pH = 7.207 + log(0.02807 / 0.036715)
Let me compute the ratio: 0.02807 / 0.036715 ≈ 0.765.

log(0.765) ≈ -0.115.

So,

pH ≈ 7.207 - 0.115 = 7.092.

So, pH is approximately 7.09.

Now, with the pH known, we can find the concentration of PO4^3- from the HPO4^2-.

The third dissociation is:

HPO4^2- ↔ H+ + PO4^3- (Ka3 = 1.8e-12)

The expression for Ka3 is [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-]

Rearranged:

[PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+]

We have Ka3 = 1.8e-12, [HPO4^2-] is 0.02807 M, and [H+] = 10^(-pH) ≈ 10^(-7.092) ≈ 8.21e-8 M.

So,

[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02807) / (8.21e-8)

Let me compute this:

1.8e-12 * 0.02807 ≈ 5.0526e-14.

Then, 5.0526e-14 / 8.21e-8 ≈ 6.156e-7 M.

Wait, but wait a minute. Let me double-check that calculation.

Hmm, 1.8e-12 * 0.02807 = 1.8 * 0.02807 is 0.050526, and then times 1e-12 → 5.0526e-14.

Divide by 8.21e-8: 5.0526e-14 / 8.21e-8 = (5.0526 /8.21) * 1e-6 ≈ 0.6156 * 1e-6 = 6.156e-7 M.

So, the concentration of PO4^3- is approximately 6.156e-7 M.

Looking at the options:

Option A is 6.24e-7, which is very close. But let me see if I made any approximations that might change this.

Wait, perhaps I should be more precise in calculating pH.

Let me re-calculate the pH step more accurately.

The ratio is 0.02807 / 0.036715 = 0.765.

log(0.765) = let me compute it more accurately.

Log(0.765) → since log(0.75)= -0.1249, log(0.77)= -0.1139. So 0.765 is between, say, approximately -0.115 as I had earlier.

But perhaps more precisely, let me compute it using calculator steps.

0.765 = 765e-3.

log(765) = log(7.65e2) → log(7.65) + 2. log(7.65)=0.8845, so 0.8845 +2= 2.8845. So log(765) is 2.8845. So log(0.765) is log(765e-3) = log(765) -3 = 2.8845 -3 = -0.1155.

So, pH = 7.207 + (-0.1155) = 7.0915 → pH ≈7.0915.

Then [H+] = 10^(-7.0915) → 10^(-7) = 1e-7, 10^(-0.0915)= approx 0.821. So [H+]= 8.21e-8 M. Correct.

So, [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02807) / (8.21e-8) = (5.0526e-14) / (8.21e-8) = 6.156e-7 M.

Looking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7, which is close. But let me check the initial calculations again.

Wait, another thing: I calculated [HPO4^2-] as 0.02807 M. Let me re-verify that.

Moles of Na2HPO4·2H2O: 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 1 / 177.99 = approximately 0.005614 mol. Divided by 0.2 L → 0.02807 M. That's correct.

Similarly, [H2PO4^-] is 0.036715 M.

So, the calculations seem correct. But the options don't have 6.156e-7. The closest is option A, 6.24e-7. Hmm, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the first step.

Wait, perhaps the third dissociation is not the only source of PO4^3-. Because H2PO4^- can lose two protons to become PO4^3-, but in solution, the main contributors are the HPO4^2- dissociating into PO4^3- and H2PO4^- contributing via the second dissociation.

Wait, but no, the H2PO4^- loses a proton to become HPO4^2- (which is what we're looking at), and then HPO4^2- loses another proton to become PO4^3-.

So, the PO4^3- comes from the HPO4^2- via Ka3. So, the calculation I did is correct.

Wait, but why isn't the option matching exactly? Let me recompute.

Let me recompute [PO4^3-]:

Ka3 = 1.8e-12.

[HPO4^2-] = 0.02807 M.

[H+] = 8.21e-8.

So,

[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02807) / (8.21e-8) 

= (5.0526e-14) / 8.21e-8

= 5.0526e-14 / 8.21e-8 = (5.0526 /8.21 ) * 1e-6.

5.0526 / 8.21 = approx 0.6154.

So, 0.6154e-6 = 6.154e-7 M.

Looking at the options:

Option A is 6.24e-7, which is a bit higher. Hmm. Perhaps I missed some decimal points or miscalculated the initial moles.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the moles more accurately.

Moles of KH2PO4:

1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.0073429 mol.

Moles of Na2HPO4·2H2O:

1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.00561407 mol.

So,

[H2PO4^-] = 0.0073429 / 0.2 = 0.0367145 M.

[HPO4^2-] = 0.00561407 / 0.2 = 0.02807035 M.

So,

Ratio = 0.02807035 / 0.0367145 ≈ 0.7651.

log(0.7651) = ?

Using more precise calculation: ln(0.7651)= approx -0.2682.

log(0.7651) = ln(0.7651)/ln(10) ≈ (-0.2682)/2.3026 ≈ -0.1164.

So, pH = pKa2 + log(...) = 7.207 + (-0.1164) = 7.0906.

[H+] = 10^(-7.0906) = 10^(-7) * 10^(-0.0906) = 1e-7 * 0.831 → 8.31e-8 M.

Wait, more accurately, 10^(-0.0906) is approximately 0.831.

So, [H+] is 8.31e-8 M.

So,

[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02807035) / (8.31e-8) 

= (5.05266e-14) / (8.31e-8) = (5.05266 /8.31) * 1e-6.

5.05266 /8.31 ≈ 0.608.

So, 0.608e-6 → 6.08e-7 M.

Hmm, that's about 6.08e-7, which is still closest to option A (6.24e-7), but not exactly matching. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of Ka3 or the initial moles.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the solution is only considering the contribution from HPO4^2- using the Ka3, but maybe I should consider all possible sources of PO4^3-.

Wait, but the only source of PO4^3- in solution is the dissociation of HPO4^2-. H2PO4^- can lose two protons, but that would require two steps, which might be negligible given the very small Ka3.

Wait, but let's think: could H2PO4^- lose two protons to become PO4^3-? The overall reaction would be:

H2PO4^- ↔ 2 H+ + PO4^3-.

The K for this reaction is Ka2 * Ka3 = (6.2e-8) * (1.8e-12) = 1.116e-19.

So, this is much smaller than the previous steps, so the amount of PO4^3- from H2PO4^- would be negligible compared to that from HPO4^2-.

So, the main contribution is from HPO4^2-.

So, in that case, the calculation remains as before.

Wait, so the problem is that 6.08e-7 is not an option. Looking again, option D is 3.97e-7, which is lower. Hmm. Did I perhaps make a mistake in the initial moles?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the concentration of HPO4^2-.

Wait, the formula for Na2HPO4·2H2O is Na2HPO4·2H2O, so each mole gives 1 mole of HPO4^2-.

So, moles of Na2HPO4·2H2O: 1.00g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.005614 mol. So, that's correct.

So, [HPO4^2-] = 0.005614 / 0.2 = 0.02807 M.

Wait, perhaps the solution is that the orthophosphate is HPO4^2- and not PO4^3-. Oh! Wait a minute! Maybe I got that wrong earlier. Let me think.

The question asks for the concentration of orthophosphate ions. I thought orthophosphate was PO4^3-, but perhaps it's HPO4^2- instead. Because sometimes, people refer to HPO4^2- as orthophosphate. Alternatively, perhaps the term is used differently.

If that's the case, then the concentration of HPO4^2- is already 0.02807 M.

But wait, that doesn't align with the options. The options are in the 1e-7 M range. Wait, no, 0.028 M is 2.8e-2 M, which is way higher than the options given. So that can't be the case.

Wait, perhaps orthophosphate refers to PO4^3-.

But then according to the calculation, it's about 6e-7 M. The closest option is A) 6.24e-7.

So, perhaps the correct answer is A.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the buffer calculation.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps the solution is not a buffer and I should consider the hydrolysis of both salts.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the solution is a buffer because both the acid (H2PO4^-) and its conjugate base (HPO4^2-) are present. So, the pH is determined by the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, which we did.

So, once pH is known, the concentration of PO4^3- comes from the HPO4^2- dissociating according to Ka3.

Which gives us [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+], which is the same as (Ka3 / [H+]) * [HPO4^2-].

Alternatively, since Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-]/[HPO4^2-], rearranged gives [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+].

Which is what I did.

So, the calculation should be correct. But why is the option not matching exactly?

Wait, perhaps the answer is option D, 3.97e-7. Let me think if I made a calculation mistake.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the H+ concentration.

Wait, pH =7.0915 → [H+] = 10^-7.0915.

Let me compute 10^-7.0915 more accurately.

7.0915 =7 + 0.0915.

So, 10^(-7.0915) = 10^-7 * 10^(-0.0915).

10^(-0.0915) = 1/(10^0.0915).

Compute 10^0.0915.

0.0915 on the log scale: 10^0.09 is about 1.23, 10^0.0915 is approximately 1.235.

So, 1/1.235 ≈ 0.810.

So, [H+] ≈ 8.10e-8 M.

So,

[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02807) / (8.10e-8) 

= (5.0526e-14) / 8.10e-8 → 5.0526e-14 /8.10e-8 = 5.0526 /8.10 * 1e-6.

5.0526 /8.10 ≈ 0.62377 → 0.62377e-6 → 6.2377e-7 M.

Ah! That's 6.24e-7 M, which matches option A.

Ah, so earlier I had used 8.21e-8 for [H+], but more accurately, it's 8.10e-8, which brings the [PO4^3-] to approximately 6.24e-7 M.

So, the correct answer is option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO₄³⁻) in the solution, we analyze the dissociation of the given salts and use the provided dissociation constants.

### Step 1: Calculate the concentrations of H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻
The solution contains 1.00 g of KH₂PO₄ and 1.00 g of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O. Using their molecular weights (136.09 g/mol and 177.99 g/mol, respectively), the moles of each are:

- **KH₂PO₄**:  
  \[
  \text{Moles} = \frac{1.00}{136.09} \approx 0.007343 \, \text{mol}
  \]  
  This contributes \([H₂PO₄⁻] = \frac{0.007343}{0.2} \approx 0.036715 \, \text{M}\).

- **Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O**:  
  \[
  \text{Moles} = \frac{1.00}{177.99} \approx 0.005614 \, \text{mol}
  \]  
  This contributes \([HPO₄²⁻] = \frac{0.005614}{0.2} \approx 0.02807 \, \text{M}\).

### Step 2: Use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH
The solution is a buffer containing H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻, which are related by the second dissociation constant of phosphoric acid (\(K_a2 = 6.2 \times 10^{-8}\)):

\[
\text{pH} = \text{p}K_a2 + \log\left(\frac{[HPO₄²⁻]}{[H₂PO₄⁻]}\right)
\]

Substitute the values:  
\[
\text{p}K_a2 = -\log(6.2 \times 10^{-8}) \approx 7.207
\]  
\[
\frac{[HPO₄²⁻]}{[H₂PO₄⁻]} = \frac{0.02807}{0.036715} \approx 0.765
\]  
\[
\log(0.765) \approx -0.115
\]  
\[
\text{pH} = 7.207 - 0.115 \approx 7.092
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the concentration of PO₄³⁻
The third dissociation of phosphoric acid is:  
\[
\text{HPO₄²⁻} \leftrightarrow \text{H⁺} + \text{PO₄³⁻}, \quad K_a3 = 1.8 \times 10^{-12}
\]

Using the expression for \(K_a3\):  
\[
K_a3 = \frac{[H⁺][PO₄³⁻]}{[HPO₄²⁻]}
\]  
Rearranging for \([PO₄³⁻]\):  
\[
[PO₄³⁻] = \frac{K_a3 \cdot [HPO₄²⁻]}{[H⁺]}
\]

From the pH, \([H⁺] = 10^{-\text{pH}} = 10^{-7.092} \approx 8.10 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{M}\). Substitute the values:  
\[
[PO₄³⁻] = \frac{(1.8 \times 10^{-12}) \cdot 0.02807}{8.10 \times 10^{-8}}
\]  
\[
[PO₄³⁻] = \frac{5.0526 \times 10^{-14}}{8.10 \times 10^{-8}} \approx 6.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

### Final Answer:
The concentration of orthophosphate ions (\(PO₄³⁻\)) in the solution is approximately \(6.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}\).
