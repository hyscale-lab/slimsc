Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

So the question says that iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. The energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. And we're assuming local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE), which I think means that the conditions in the photosphere mimic the conditions in a small, localized region, allowing the use of standard thermal physics equations.

Wait, the key here is the excitation of energy levels. I remember that this relates to the Boltzmann distribution, which describes the population of particles in different energy states in a system in thermal equilibrium. The Boltzmann factor tells us the ratio of the number of particles in two energy levels.

The Boltzmann equation is something like (n_i / n_j) = (g_i/g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) ), where n is the number density, g is the statistical weight, E is energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is temperature.

In this case, the problem states that the excitation is twice as high in star_1. So for star_1, the population in the excited state (n_i) compared to star_2's (n_j) is 2:1. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the problem says iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. So maybe n1 (excited state) / n2 (excited state) = 2? Or is it the ratio of excited to ground state? Hmm, I need to clarify.

Wait, the question says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So perhaps the specific energy level in star_1 has twice the population of the same level in star_2. Or, more likely, the ratio n1/n2 is 2. Or perhaps the ratio is the other way around, because if star_1's atoms are more excited, maybe they have a higher population in higher energy states.

Wait, maybe the ratio is n1 (excited state) / n2 (excited state) = 2. Alternatively, perhaps it's the ratio of the excited state to the ground state. Wait, no, the question says the atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level. So perhaps the ratio (n_i/n_j) is 2, where n_i is the excited state and n_j is not that state. Wait, but the question might just be saying that the population of the specific level (say, level i) in star_1 is twice that in star_2. So perhaps n1_i / n2_i = 2.

Wait, but the Boltzmann equation gives the ratio between two states. Let me think: for each star, the ratio of the population of the excited state to the ground state is given by the Boltzmann factor. So for each star, n_i / n_j = exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) ) * (g_i/g_j). But since the energy difference is given as 1.38e-23 J, and assuming the statistical weights are the same (if the levels are the same, like same ionization state of iron), then g_i/g_j would be 1. So the ratio becomes exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), where ΔE is positive if E_i is higher than E_j.

Wait, but for each star, the ratio of their own excitation would be different. Let me define for star 1: (n1_i / n1_j) = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

Similarly, for star 2: (n2_i / n2_j) = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

The question states that the excitation in star_1 is twice that of star_2. So maybe the ratio (n1_i + n1_j) is higher? Or perhaps it's the ratio (n_i / (n_i + n_j)) that's higher? Wait, no, I think the problem is comparing the number of excited atoms in each star. Wait, perhaps the ratio (n1_i / n1_j) is twice (n2_i / n2_j). Or alternatively, the ratio between the excited states in each star is 2.

Wait, the question is a bit ambiguous. Let me read it again. It says, "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So I think that for a given energy level (say, level i), the number of iron atoms in star_1 in that level is twice that in star_2. So n1_i = 2 * n2_i.

But wait, maybe the excitation refers to the ionization state. Or perhaps the specific energy level in star_1 has double the population of that same level in star_2. That is, n1_i / n2_i = 2.

Wait, but if we take that approach, then for each star, the ratio (n_i / (n_i + n_j)) is the excitation fraction. But perhaps the question is considering the ratio of excitation between the two stars for the same energy level.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the ratio (n_i / n_j) for each star, and then taking the ratio between the two stars.

Wait, but another approach is to consider the ratio of (n_i / n_j) for star 1 compared to star 2. If star_1 has (n1_i / n1_j) = 2 * (n2_i / n2_j), then that ratio would be 2.

Wait, let me try to formalize this. Let’s denote for star_1, the ratio (n1_i / n1_j) = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

And for star_2, (n2_i / n2_j) = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

If the excitation in star_1 is twice that of star_2, perhaps that means (n1_i / n1_j) = 2 * (n2_i / n2_j )

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the excitation is higher, which would mean that the population in the excited state is higher relative to the ground state. So for star_1, (n1_i / n1_j) is higher than that of star_2. So the ratio (n1_i / n1_j ) / (n2_i / n2_j ) = 2.

So (n1_i / n1_j ) = 2 * (n2_i / n2_j )

Taking the natural log of both sides:

ln( (n1_i / n1_j ) / (n2_i / n2_j) ) = ln(2)

Which becomes [ ln(n1_i/n1_j) - ln(n2_i/n2_j) ] = ln(2 )

But from the Boltzmann equation,

ln(n_i/n_j) = -ΔE/(k T) + ln(g_i/g_j)

Assuming g_i = g_j, this simplifies to ln(n_i/n_j) = -ΔE/(k T)

So for star 1, ln(n1_i/n1_j) = -ΔE/(k T1 )

For star 2, ln(n2_i/n2_j) = -ΔE/(k T2 )

So the difference between these two is:

[ ln(n1_i/n1_j) - ln(n2_i/n2_j) ] = [ -ΔE/(k T1) ] - [ -ΔE/(k T2) ] = ΔE/(k) [ 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ]

Wait, wait, that can't be right. Let me compute it properly.

ln(n1_i/n1_j) = -ΔE/(k T1 )

ln(n2_i/n2_j) = -ΔE/(k T2 )

So the difference is:

[ ln(n1_i/n1_j) - ln(n2_i/n2_j) ] = [ -ΔE/(k T1) ] - [ -ΔE/(k T2) ]

Simplify this:

= -ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2 )

= ΔE/(k) [ 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ]

But the left-hand side of the equation is ln(2), as per the earlier condition that (n1_i/n1_j)/(n2_i/n2_j) ) = 2. So:

ln(2) = ΔE/(k) [ 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ]

Wait, that would give:

ln(2) = (ΔE / k) [ (T1 - T2 ) / (T1 T2) ) ]

Wait, because 1/T2 - 1/T1 = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

Wait, let me compute 1/T2 - 1/T1:

= (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2 )

So the equation becomes:

ln(2) = (ΔE/k) * ( (T1 - T2) ) / (T1 T2 )

So rearranged:

ΔE = k ln(2) * ( T1 T2 ) / ( T1 - T2 )

But wait, the problem gives the value of ΔE as 1.38e-23 J. Hmm, but perhaps the equation we're looking for is in terms of T1 and T2. So let me rearrange the equation we have:

ln(2) = (ΔE/k) * ( (T1 - T2) ) / (T1 T2 )

Multiply both sides by k:

k ln(2) = ΔE ( T1 - T2 ) / ( T1 T2 )

But I'm supposed to find the correct equation relating T1 and T2. Let me look at the options again.

The options are:

A) ln(2) = T2/T1

B) ln(2) = (T1 + T2)/(T1 T2)

C) ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)^2

D) ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

Wait, from my equation, I have:

ln(2) = (ΔE / k) * (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2 )

But with the given ΔE, but the options don't have ΔE in them. So perhaps the correct equation is ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/( T1 T2 ) multiplied by (ΔE/k )

But none of the options include ΔE, so maybe the question assumes that the equation is in terms of the ratio, without the ΔE and k factors. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in setting up the problem.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the question is referring to the excitation in terms of the ratio between the number of atoms in a specific level for each star. So n1_i = 2 * n2_i. But how does this relate to the temperatures?

Wait, each star’s photosphere has its own ratio. So for star 1, n1_i / n1_j = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

Similarly, star 2: n2_i / n2_j = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

The problem says that n1_i = 2 * n2_i, but I'm not sure if that's the case. Alternatively, perhaps the ratio (n1_i / n2_i) = 2. But that would imply that the number of excited atoms in star_1 is twice that in star_2, which depends on the temperatures and their respective other populations.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio of the excitation is (n_i / n_j ) for star 1 is twice that for star 2. So:

(n1_i / n1_j ) = 2 * (n2_i / n2_j )

Which, taking logs, gives:

ln(n1_i/n1_j) - ln( n2_i / n2_j ) = ln(2)

From the Boltzmann equation:

ln(n_i/n_j) = -ΔE/(k T) 

So,

[ -ΔE/(k T1) ] - [ -ΔE/(k T2) ] = ln(2 )

Which simplifies to:

ΔE/(k) [ 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ) ] = ln(2 )

As before, which can be written as:

ΔE/(k) ( (T1 - T2) ) / ( T1 T2 ) ) = ln(2 )

But without knowing ΔE and k, perhaps this is not directly helpful. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects me to set up the equation in terms of T1 and T2 without the constants, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the ratio of the excitation is given by (n_i / n_j ) for each star, and for star_1, this is twice as much as for star_2. So (n1_i / n1_j ) = 2 * (n2_i / n2_j )

Which would mean:

exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Taking natural logs:

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) + ( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Rearranging:

-ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) = ln(2 )

Factor out ΔE/(k ):

ΔE/(k ) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ) = ln(2 )

Which is the same as before.

So, 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) = [ ln(2) * k ] / ΔE 

But in the options, there's no mention of ΔE, so perhaps the key is to express T1 and T2 in terms of each other without involving ΔE.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find a relation between T1 and T2 by rearranging the equation.

From the earlier equation:

ln(2) = (ΔE/k) * (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2 )

If I rearrange terms:

(T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ) = (k ln(2)) / ΔE 

But since ΔE is given, perhaps the equation is expressed as ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 ) multiplied by (ΔE/k ), but again, the options don't have these terms.

Wait, maybe I can express the equation in terms of (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) ) = [ ln(2) * k ] / ΔE 

Which can be written as (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = same thing.

So, the equation is (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = [ ln(2) * k ] / ΔE 

But the question probably expects us to express it in terms of the reciprocal, leading to one of the options.

Looking back at the options, option D is ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

Hmm, that's similar to the structure I have, except that in the actual equation, it's multiplied by (ΔE/k ). But the options don't include ΔE. So perhaps the correct equation is option D, because it's in the form ln(2) equals the (T1 - T2) over (T1 T2), but that would only be true if (ΔE/k ) equals 1.

Wait, what's the value of ΔE/k? Let me compute that:

Given ΔE = 1.38e-23 J.

k (Boltzmann constant) is approximately 1.38e-23 J/K.

So ΔE/k = (1.38e-23 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) ) = 1 K.

So ΔE/k is 1 K.

So, going back to the equation:

ln(2) = (ΔE/k) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

Since ΔE/k =1, the equation simplifies to:

ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

Which is exactly option D.

Ah, I see now. So the correct equation is option D.

The problem involves determining the relationship between the effective temperatures of two stars (T₁ and T₂) based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. The key information provided is that the excitation of iron atoms in star_1 is twice as high as in star_2, and the energy difference between the considered energy levels is ΔE = 1.38 × 10⁻²³ J. The analysis proceeds using the Boltzmann distribution, which relates the population of particles in different energy levels to temperature.

The Boltzmann equation is expressed as:

\[
\frac{n_i}{n_j} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right)
\]

where \(n_i\) and \(n_j\) are the populations of the excited and ground states, \(\Delta E\) is the energy difference between the states, \(k\) is the Boltzmann constant, and \(T\) is the temperature. For star_1 and star_2, the ratios of excited to ground state populations are:

\[
\frac{n_{1i}}{n_{1j}} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right), \quad \frac{n_{2i}}{n_{2j}} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right)
\]

The problem states that the excitation in star_1 is twice that in star_2, implying:

\[
\frac{n_{1i}}{n_{1j}} = 2 \cdot \frac{n_{2i}}{n_{2j}}
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
\ln\left(\frac{n_{1i}/n_{1j}}{n_{2i}/n_{2j}}\right) = \ln(2)
\]

Substituting the Boltzmann equations into the logarithmic expression:

\[
\ln\left(\frac{\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right)}{\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right)}\right) = \ln(2)
\]

Simplifying:

\[
\ln\left(\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1} + \frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right)\right) = \ln(2)
\]

\[
-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1} + \frac{\Delta E}{k T_2} = \ln(2)
\]

Factoring out \(\Delta E / k\):

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right) = \ln(2)
\]

Rewriting \(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\) as \(\frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}\):

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \cdot \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} = \ln(2)
\]

The problem provides \(\Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}\), and the Boltzmann constant \(k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K}\). Substituting these values:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} = \frac{1.38 \times 10^{-23}}{1.38 \times 10^{-23}} = 1
\]

Thus, the equation simplifies to:

\[
\frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} = \ln(2)
\]

This matches option D. Therefore, the correct equation relating the effective temperatures of the stars is:

**ln(2) = \(\frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}\)**

Answer: D
