Okay, so I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem, and honestly, it's a bit tricky, but I'll take it step by step. Let me read the question again and try to break it down.

So, the question is about a series of reactions, and we need to find the molecular symmetry group of product E. The options are symmetry groups like C2, D4h, D∞h, and C2v. I remember that these are symmetry point groups, so each corresponds to a different arrangement of atoms in a molecule.

Let me start by figuring out what each compound might be based on the reactions described.

First reaction: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. Hmm, 8 equivalents... that suggests a stoichiometric ratio of 1:8. So maybe A is something that reacts with B in an 1:8 molar ratio. The product is bright red, which makes me think of something like copper(II) sulfate solution being blue, but maybe a different reaction. Wait, another possibility: maybe it's the formation of a compound like CuO or CuSO4, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, consider metals reacting with something. Wait, another thought: if A is sodium sulfide (Na2S), and B is chlorine gas (Cl2), maybe forming NaCl and S? But that might not fit the ratio. Alternatively, perhaps A is a metal and B is a halogen, but I'm not certain yet.

Wait, the product C is bright red. Bright red makes me think of something like rust or maybe a chromium compound, but more likely, perhaps a transition metal oxide. Wait, another possibility: maybe C is a copper(II) compound. Or perhaps it's a nitrate? Hmm.

Wait, let's move on to the next reaction to get more clues. C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce E, which is extremely hazardous. Then, C also reacts with water to form A, F, and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. So when C reacts with water, it breaks down into A and two acids. Wait, that suggests that C has acidic properties. Maybe it's a sulfide? Or perhaps a nitride? Wait, if C is a sulfide, then reacting with water would produce H2S (which is a weak acid, but wait, no, H2S is a weak acid, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, if C is a metal oxide, perhaps when it reacts with water it forms a metal hydroxide, but then that wouldn't give acids. Maybe C is a sulfate? Wait, if C is CuSO4, which is white, not bright red. So that might not fit.

Wait, another approach: if the reaction of C with water gives two different acids, F and G, and F is a strong acid, G a weak one. So maybe C is a sulfite? No, because sulfites reacting with water would produce H2SO3 (which is a weak acid) and perhaps sodium sulfate? Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a nitrate. Wait, let me think about the first reaction again. Solid A plus 8 equivalents of gas B makes C. Maybe A is a metal and B is a diatomic gas. For example, maybe A is Fe (iron metal) and B is Cl2. Then 8 equivalents of Cl2 would mean 4 moles of Cl2 per mole of Fe, perhaps forming FeCl4? But FeCl4 is more commonly FeCl3. Wait, but 8 equivalents would mean 4 Cl2 per Fe? Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, maybe A is carbon, and B is something else. Wait, but carbon reacting with 8 equivalents of something? Not sure.

Wait, another angle: the product E is extremely hazardous. E comes from C reacting with gas D in a 1:2 ratio. Maybe D is a halogen, like F2 or Cl2? Or perhaps a different gas. Alternatively, E could be something like phosgene (which is toxic), but I'm not sure how that would form.

Wait, let me think about the third reaction: C reacts with water to form A, F, and G. So, the reaction is C + H2O → A + F + G. F is a strong acid, G a weak acid. Let's think about possible compounds that, when reacted with water, produce two acids. For example, if C is a sulfite, maybe it breaks down into H2SO3 (weak acid) and another acid. Wait, but I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, maybe C is a metal carbonate. For instance, if C is Na2CO3, then reacting with water would just give NaOH and CO2 (but CO2 is a weak acid, but NaOH is a base, not an acid. So that doesn't fit.)

Wait, another possibility: maybe C is a nitride, like NH3? No, because when NH3 reacts with water, it doesn't form a strong acid. Alternatively, maybe C is a sulfide, like FeS. When FeS reacts with water, it doesn't do much, as it's usually stable. Hmm.

Wait, let's think about the first reaction again. 8 equivalents of B to form C. So, perhaps the reaction is something like 2A + 8B → C. Maybe A is Fe and B is Cl2. Then 2 Fe + 8 Cl2 → 2 FeCl4? Wait, no, FeCl3 is more common. Alternatively, 8 equivalents of Cl2 for 1 mole of A. So maybe the formula would be ACl8. Hmm. What metal has an 8:1 ratio with Cl2? Maybe it's something like TiCl4, but that would require 4 Cl2 per Ti, which is 4 equivalents. Not 8. Alternatively, perhaps it's a transition metal with a higher oxidation state.

Wait, another thought: if A is copper and B is chlorine, perhaps 2 Cu + 8 Cl2 → 4 CuCl2. Wait, but that would be 4 moles of CuCl2, each requiring 2 Cl2 per Cu, so 8 Cl2 for 2 Cu. So 8 equivalents of Cl2 for 2 moles of Cu, which would be 4 equivalents per mole. That doesn't quite fit the 8 equivalents per mole of A. Maybe I'm getting confused here.

Alternatively, maybe A is sodium, and B is chlorine. 2 Na + Cl2 → 2 NaCl. But that's only 1 equivalent of Cl2. Not 8. So that's not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps A is sulfur. Sulfur reacting with something to form a compound. Let's see, when sulfur reacts with a gas. Hmm, maybe reacting with O2 to form SO3? But that's a gas reacting with another gas, not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a reaction where sulfur is oxidized.

Wait, perhaps A is FeO (iron(II) oxide) and B is O2. Then 4 FeO + 8 O2 → 2 Fe2O4? Wait, but Fe2O4 is not common; iron typically forms FeO, Fe3O4, or Fe2O3. Alternatively, maybe it's the formation of Fe3O4, which is a mix of FeO and Fe2O3. But I'm not sure if that fits the 8 equivalents.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about the product when C reacts with water. It produces A, F, and G, where F is a strong acid and G is a weak acid. So perhaps C is a sulfate. Wait, but sulfate reacting with water wouldn't produce strong and weak acids; it might just stay as sulfate.

Wait, another possibility: C could be a metal sulfide. For example, suppose C is CuS, which when reacted with water doesn't do much, but perhaps if it's a different metal. Alternatively, maybe it's a nitride. For example, if C is NH4NO3, but that might not fit.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a peroxide, like Na2O2. When Na2O2 reacts with water, it produces NaOH (strong base), O2, and H2O2 (which is an acid, but not sure if classified as such). But that doesn't fit the F and G being acids.

Wait, maybe C is a sulfite, like Na2SO3. When it reacts with water, perhaps it's just in solution as Na2SO3, which would dissociate into 2 Na+ and SO3^2-; but that doesn't produce any acids. So that's not it.

Wait, maybe C is a nitrate, like Ca(NO3)2. When it reacts with water, it just stays as nitrate ions, so that doesn't fit either.

Hmm, I'm stuck on this part. Let me try another angle.

The third reaction: C + H2O → A + F + G. So, perhaps C is a salt that contains both strong and weak acid anions. Or maybe C is a compound that when hydrolyzed produces two different acids. Wait, for example, if C is a metal bisulfate or something. Alternatively, perhaps C is a carbonate, but that would produce CO3^2- which hydrolyzes to CO2 and H2O, but that's a weak acid. But then you'd need another acid.

Wait, another approach: maybe C is a sulfonate ester or something. No, that's probably too complicated.

Wait, maybe I should think about the earlier reactions to find more clues.

In the first reaction, solid A plus 8 equivalents of gas B forms C. If B is a diatomic gas like Cl2, then 8 equivalents would mean 8 moles of Cl2 per mole of A. So, the formula for C would be ACl8. What metals form such compounds? I don't recall any common ones. Maybe it's a transition metal with a high oxidation state.

Alternatively, perhaps B is O2. Let's say A is carbon; reacting carbon with O2 at high temperatures might produce CO or CO2, but 8 equivalents would suggest 4 O2 per C. Hmm, that would be C + 8 O2 → something, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe A is a metal like titanium. TiCl4 is TiCl4, which would require 4 Cl2 per Ti, so 4 equivalents. So that's not matching the 8 equivalents. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe B is chlorine and A is aluminum. Al reacts with Cl2 in combustion to form AlCl3. The reaction is 2 Al + 3 Cl2 → 2 AlCl3. So 3 equivalents of Cl2 per 2 Al. That's 1.5 equivalents per Al. Doesn't match 8.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is A (solid) + 8 B → C.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the reaction is between a metal and a halogen, but producing a higher halide. For example, perhaps A is Na (solid), B is Cl2. Then Na + Cl2 → NaCl. But that's 1 equivalent of Cl2 per Na. Not 8.

Wait, maybe it's a reaction of a metal with Cl2 to form a higher chloro compound. Like, perhaps, something like PCl5. For phosphorus, the reaction is P (solid) + 5 Cl2 → PCl5. So 5 equivalents of Cl2 per P. Not 8.

Alternatively, maybe a metal like iron reacting to form FeCl4? But I'm not sure if that's a common compound. Iron usually forms FeCl2 and FeCl3.

Alternatively, perhaps A is a metal that forms an 8-coordinate complex, but I'm not sure.

This is getting a bit frustrating. Maybe I should look at another part of the problem.

The second reaction: C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to form E, which is extremely hazardous. E could be something like sarin gas, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, something like phosgene (which is COCl2), but I don't know how that would form.

Alternatively, maybe E is a highly toxic gas like HCN? But how would that form?

Wait, another angle: D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent. H is a solvent, so maybe it's something like H2O, but B is a gas. Alternatively, H could be something like NH3, but then B would be something else.

Wait, D reacts with B in 1:1 ratio to form H. If B is Cl2 and D is something like NH3, but that's not a 1:1 reaction. Alternatively, if B is O2 and D is H2, then 2 H2 + O2 → 2 H2O. But that's a 2:1 ratio, not 1:1.

Wait, perhaps B is Cl2 and D is H2. Then H would be HCl. But HCl is a gas, not a solvent. Alternatively, maybe it's something else.

Wait, another possibility: B is O2, D is H2, then H is H2O. But H2O is a solvent. So the reaction would be 2 H2 + O2 → 2 H2O. That's a 1:1 ratio for H2 and O2. So maybe B is O2, D is H2, making H as H2O.

If that's the case, then what is C? Let's see: C reacts with H2O (when it reacts with water) to form A, F, and G. So, C is something that when hydrolyzed gives A and two acids.

If H is H2O, then D is H2, and B is O2.

So back to the first reaction: A (solid) + 8 O2 → C (bright red). Hmm, a solid reacting with O2 in high amounts to form a bright red product. Bright red could be something like Fe2O3·nH2O (which is usually yellow or reddish), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a manganese compound. MnO2 is black, I think.

Wait, another thought: copper(II) oxide is black, not red. Chromium(VI) compounds can be orange or red. For example, potassium dichromate (K2Cr2O7) is orange. But when solid, it's a bright red or orange color.

Wait, so if A is K, reacting with O2 to form K2Cr2O7? No, because in that case, K would react with O2 to form KO2 or something else, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe A is chromium metal. Chromium reacts with O2 to form CrO3, which is a dark green solid, but maybe under certain conditions forms a red product. Not sure.

Wait, maybe the product C is a sulfate. If A is S, then S + O2 → SO3? No, that's a gas. Or maybe S reacting with O2 forms SO2 or SO3, but that's gaseous. Hmm, not matching the solid description.

Another possibility: if A is Cu, and the reaction forms CuO. But CuO is black, not red. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe the bright red product is due to the formation of a nitrate. For example, copper nitrate is blue, but maybe another nitrate is red. Alternatively, perhaps A is lead and forms PbO2, which is brown.

Hmm, this is getting a bit tangled. Let me try to summarize what I have so far.

1. A (solid) + 8 B (gas) → C (bright red solid)
2. C + 2 D (gas) → E (extremely hazardous)
3. C + H2O → A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid)
4. D + B → H (solvent, 1:1 ratio)

From point 4, if H is a solvent, and D and B are gases reacting in 1:1 ratio, perhaps:

If B is O2 and D is H2, then H is H2O. That makes sense because 2 H2 + O2 → 2 H2O. But the stoichiometry is 2 H2 : 1 O2, which is a 2:1 ratio, not 1:1. So that's a problem.

Alternatively, maybe B is O2 and D is another diatomic gas. Let's say, for example, H2O2 as H. But that doesn't fit because H2O2 is a liquid, not a gas. Alternatively, maybe D is F2, but that's a gas, but then H would be OF2, which I don't think is a common solvent.

Alternatively, maybe B is Cl2 and D is H2. Then H would be HCl, which is a gas, not a solvent. Not helpful.

Wait, another possibility: D is NH3 and B is HCl. But that would form NH4Cl, which is a solid, not a solvent. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps B is CO2 and D is H2O. But then H would be H2CO3, which is a weak acid, not a solvent. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps B is H2 and D is O2. Then H is H2O, which is a solvent. But the reaction would be 2 H2 + O2 → 2 H2O. So the ratio is 2:1, not 1:1. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm, maybe I'm on the wrong track with H being a solvent. Let me think of other solvents. Maybe ethanol? But how would that form from B and D in 1:1 ratio.

Wait, another approach: perhaps B is a diatomic gas like O2, and D is another diatomic gas like F2. Then H could be O2F2, which is called oxygen difluoride. But is that a solvent? I don't think so.

Wait, perhaps H is NH3, which is a solvent. Then D and B would react in a 1:1 ratio to form NH3. So for example, if B is H2O and D is NH3. But that doesn't make sense, because they're both gases, but not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps B is N2 and D is H2. But I don't see how that would form a solvent in a 1:1 ratio.

This is getting complicated. Maybe I should think of other possible solvents formed from reactions of two gases in 1:1 ratio. For example, H2O is formed from H2 and O2 in a 2:1 ratio. That's not matching. Alternatively, maybe D and B form CH4, but that's a stretch.

Alternatively, perhaps H is something like CH3OH (methanol), but that's a solvent. How would that form from two gases in 1:1 ratio? Maybe from CO and H2: CO + 2 H2 → CH3OH. But that's a 1:2 ratio, so not 1:1.

Hmm, perhaps I'm stuck on this part. Let me think about E. E is extremely hazardous, produced by C reacting with D in a 1:2 ratio.

If E is a highly toxic gas, maybe it's something like HCN, but that would require C to have some cyanide-like properties. Or perhaps it's a nerve agent like sarin, but I'm not sure how that would form from C and D.

Alternatively, E could be a highly toxic compound like phosgene (COCl2), but how would that form?

Wait, another possibility: E is hydrogen fluoride, but that's not extremely hazardous in the same way as, say, sarin. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe E is a metal cyanide, but that's more of a solid.

Wait, perhaps E is a highly reactive compound like O3, but ozone is a gas but not extremely hazardous in small amounts, though it's harmful.

Alternatively, maybe E is a peroxide, like H2O2, but that's a liquid and not extremely hazardous, though it can cause burns.

Hmm, I'm not making much progress here. Let me go back to the third reaction: C + H2O → A + F + G. F is a strong acid, G a weak acid.

So, perhaps when C reacts with water, it produces two acids. Let me think about which compounds do that. 

Wait, if C is a sulfite, like Na2SO3. Reacting with water doesn't produce any H+ ions because it's already in solution as SO3^2-. But if C is something like a sulfonate ester, perhaps it would hydrolyze into a strong and weak acid. Alternatively, maybe C is a carbonate, but carbonate hydrolyzes into CO3^2- and HCO3^-.

Wait, another possibility: C is a metal sulfide. For example, if C is ZnS, but ZnS is a mineral and doesn't react much with water. Alternatively, maybe it's a more reactive metal sulfide like Na2S. Na2S reacts with water to produce 2 NaOH and H2S. But NaOH is a base, not an acid. Hmm, that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a nitride. For example, if C is NH4NO3 (ammonium nitrate), which decomposes upon heating into N2O and H2O, but upon reaction with water, it just dissolves. Not sure.

Wait, maybe C is a bisulfate, like NaHSO4. When it reacts with water, it dissociates into Na+, HSO4^- which can further dissociate into H+ and SO4^2-. But that doesn't produce two different acids.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a mixed salt. For example, something like NaHSO3, which could produce H2SO3 (weak acid) and NaOH (base), but again, not matching.

Wait, another angle: perhaps C is a sulfonamide or something, but that's probably too complex.

Alternatively, maybe C is a metal oxide that reacts with water to form a strong acid and another compound. Wait, for example, if C is CaO (quicklime), reacting with water produces Ca(OH)2, which is a base, not acid. So that's not it.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. The reaction C + H2O → A + F + G. So two acids are formed. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: perhaps C is a sulfonate ester. For example, if C is R-SO3-O-R', then hydrolysis could produce two different acids. But I'm not sure about the specifics.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a mixed carbonate and sulfate, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, maybe C is a peroxide, like H2O2, but then reacting with water wouldn't produce two acids.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal bisulfide. For example, if C is CuS, but reacting with water doesn't produce much.

Hmm, perhaps I should consider a different approach. Let's think about E's molecular symmetry. The options are C2, D4h, D∞h, or C2v. 

Molecular symmetry groups depend on the molecule's structure. For example:

- C2 has a 2-fold rotation axis.
- D4h implies a four-fold rotation with inversion and a horizontal mirror.
- D∞h is like the symmetry of a regular polygon with infinite sides, which would be linear molecules like CO2, H2O (but H2O is not linear), or O2, N2, etc.
- C2v has a 2-fold rotation axis and two vertical mirror planes.

Wait, if E is a linear molecule, it would have D∞h symmetry. For example, CO2 has D∞h symmetry. Ozone (O3) has C2v symmetry because it's a bent molecule with a central oxygen connected to two others, and a mirror plane through the central atom and each O-O bond.

Wait, O3 has a bent structure, so its symmetry is C2v. Similarly, other bent triatomic molecules like H2O (though H2O is not linear) also have C2v symmetry.

Wait, but O3's point group is actually D3h, but wait, no. Let me think again. Ozone is a trigonal planar molecule but bent, so its symmetry is C2v. Alternatively, I might be mixing up the point groups.

Wait, another example: if E is a molecule with a center of inversion and a four-fold rotation axis, it would be D4h. For example, something like a square planar molecule might have D4h symmetry, but that's more for transition metal complexes.

Alternatively, if E is a diatomic molecule like O2 or Cl2, it would have D∞h symmetry because it's linear with a center of inversion and multiple mirror planes.

Wait, considering all this, if E is a diatomic molecule, its symmetry group would be D∞h. But E is extremely hazardous, so perhaps it's a diatomic like Cl2 or O3?

Wait, wait, O3 is a triatomic molecule, so it's not diatomic. Cl2 is diatomic and has D∞h symmetry. But Cl2 is a gas, not extremely hazardous in the sense of being a nerve agent or something. Alternatively, sarin is a liquid, but I'm not sure about its structure.

Wait, another thought: perhaps E is phosgene (COCl2), which is a toxic gas. Its structure is linear: O=C=O with two Cl atoms attached. Wait, no, phosgene is O=CCl2. So the molecule is planar, but is it linear? No, it's a trigonal planar structure. So its point group is D3h, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps E is something like HCN, which is linear. HCN has D∞h symmetry because it's a linear molecule with polar bonds, but the point group is D∞h.

Wait, HCN is a linear molecule, so its symmetry is D∞h. That matches option B, D4h? No, wait, D∞h is one of the options. Option C is D∞h. So if E is HCN, which is linear, then its symmetry group is D∞h.

But earlier, I thought E is produced by C reacting with D in a 1:2 ratio. So, if C is something that reacts with D to form HCN, perhaps.

But I'm not entirely sure about the compounds involved. Alternatively, if E is O3, then its symmetry group is C2v, which is option D.

Wait, but to decide between these, I need to figure out what E is.

Let me think about the possible reactions again. If C reacts with D in a 1:2 ratio to form E, and E is extremely hazardous, perhaps E is a nerve agent like sarin. Sarin is a organophosphorus compound with the structure (OP)(O)(OCH2CH3)3. But I don't think that's a gas, and I don't know its symmetry group.

Alternatively, maybe E is phosgene (O=CCl2), which is a toxic gas. Phosgene has the structure O=C=O with two Cl atoms attached. Wait, no, phosgene is O=CCl2, so it's a planar molecule with trigonal symmetry. Its point group would be D3h, I think, but that's not one of the options given.

Alternatively, perhaps E is Cl2 gas, which is diatomic and has D∞h symmetry. But is Cl2 extremely hazardous? It's irritating and toxic, but not in the same way as sarin or phosgene.

Wait, maybe E is ozone (O3). Ozone has a bent structure, which would give it C2v symmetry. So symmetry group C2v, which is option D. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, if E is a linear molecule like HCN, which has D∞h symmetry, then the answer would be option C.

But I'm getting a bit stuck here because I can't clearly figure out what E is. Let me try to recap what I know:

- A + 8 B → C (bright red)
- C + 2 D → E (extremely hazardous)
- C + H2O → A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid)
- D + B → H (solvent, 1:1)

From the last point, perhaps D is H2 and B is O2. Then H is H2O, which is a solvent. But their reaction would be 2 H2 + O2 → 2 H2O, which is a 2:1 ratio, not 1:1. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps B is O2 and D is another gas. Let's say D is F2. Then H would be O2F2 (oxygen difluoride), but I'm not sure if that's a solvent.

Alternatively, perhaps B is O2 and D is something else. Maybe D is NH3, but that's a gas. Then H would be H2O, but again, the ratio is 2:1.

Hmm, this is tricky. Maybe I should think about the third reaction again. C + H2O → A + F + G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid.

Suppose F is H2SO4 (strong acid) and G is H2SO3 (weak acid). Then, C would be a compound that when hydrolyzed gives both H2SO4 and H2SO3. But that doesn't make much sense because H2SO4 is a strong acid and H2SO3 is a weak one. How would C break down into both?

Alternatively, perhaps C is a mixed salt, but I can't think of a common one.

Wait, another possibility: C could be a sulfonate ester that hydrolyzes to give a strong acid and another acid. But I'm not sure about the specifics.

Alternatively, maybe C is a metal bisulfate. For example, if C is NaHSO4, then reacting with water would give Na+ and HSO4^- which can dissociate into H+ and SO4^2-. But that would produce H+ (acid) and SO4^2-, but not two different acids.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a mixed carbonate and sulfite, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let's think about the first reaction again. 1 mole of A reacts with 8 moles of B to form C.

If B is a diatomic gas like O2, then 8 moles would be 4 moles of O2 per mole of A. That suggests A is a metal that forms a high oxidation state oxide. For example, TiO2 is Ti in +4 oxidation state. The reaction for Ti metal would be Ti + 2 O2 → TiO2. That's 2 equivalents of O2 per Ti. Doesn't match 8 equivalents.

Alternatively, maybe A is sulfur. S8 (the form of sulfur) reacting with O2 to form SO3. The reaction would be S8 + 12 O2 → 8 SO3. That's 12 equivalents of O2 per mole of S8, which is more than 8. Not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps A is phosphorus. P4 + O2 → P4O10. The reaction is P4 + 5 O2 → 2 P2O5. So 5 equivalents of O2 per P4. That's 2.5 equivalents per P atom. Not 8.

Hmm, maybe B isn't O2. Maybe it's Cl2. So A reacts with 8 Cl2 to form C.

If A is Na, then 2 Na + Cl2 → 2 NaCl. That's 1 equivalent of Cl2 per 2 Na. Not 8.

If A is Fe, then Fe + 3 Cl2 → FeCl3. That's 3 equivalents of Cl2 per Fe. Not 8.

Alternatively, perhaps A is a diatomic element. Let's say A is S (solid). Then, S + 8 Cl2 → something. Not sure.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the reaction is a combustion reaction. For example, if A is carbon, then C + 2 O2 → CO2. That's 2 equivalents of O2 per C. Not 8.

Alternatively, maybe it's a reaction where A is a metal and B is a halogen, forming a higher halide. For example, Fe reacting with Cl2 to form FeCl4, which is not common. But the reaction would be Fe + 4 Cl2 → FeCl4. That's 4 equivalents of Cl2 per Fe. Not 8.

Wait, maybe A is a transition metal that forms an 8-coordinate complex. For example, perhaps a metal like Ni, which can form NiCl4^2- in solution. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps A is an element that forms a compound with 8 equivalents of B. Maybe A is N2, and B is H2. Then, N2 + 8 H2 → something. That's unlikely, though, since N2 is inert.

Hmm, I'm stuck again. Maybe I should consider that the molecular symmetry of E is either D∞h or C2v, and see which of these options are present.

Looking back, the options are:

A) C2
B) D4h
C) D∞h
D) C2v

If E is a linear molecule like HCN or CO2, then it's D∞h. If E is O3, which is bent, then it's C2v.

Given that E is extremely hazardous, perhaps it's a nerve gas like sarin, but I don't know its structure. Alternatively, phosgene is a toxic gas with D3h symmetry, but that's not one of the options.

Alternatively, maybe E is a triatomic molecule like O3, which has C2v symmetry.

So, if E is O3, the symmetry group is C2v, which is option D.

But earlier I thought that E might be HCN with D∞h symmetry, which would be option C.

Hmm, without knowing exactly what E is, it's hard to decide. But given the options, I'll have to make an educated guess.

Given the information, perhaps E is O3, which is a bent molecule with C2v symmetry. So the answer would be D) C2v.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves determining the molecular symmetry group of compound E based on a series of reactions. Here's the analysis:

1. **Reaction 1**: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. The bright red color suggests a transition metal compound, possibly involving sulfur or oxygen. However, the exact identity of A, B, and C remains unclear.

2. **Reaction 2**: C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce E, which is extremely hazardous. This suggests E could be a toxic gas or compound, such as phosgene, sarin, or ozone (O₃). The symmetry group of E depends on its molecular structure.

3. **Reaction 3**: C reacts with water to form A, F (a strong acid), and G (a weak acid). This indicates C is likely a compound that hydrolyzes into two acids, such as a sulfite or sulfonate ester. However, the exact identity of C is not definitively determined.

4. **Reaction 4**: D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent. This suggests H could be water (H₂O), but the stoichiometry of the reaction does not perfectly align with known reactions.

### Molecular Symmetry Analysis:
- **D∞h symmetry**: This corresponds to linear molecules like CO₂ or HCN. If E were a linear molecule like HCN, its symmetry group would be D∞h. However, HCN is not explicitly suggested by the reactions.
- **C2v symmetry**: This corresponds to bent molecules like ozone (O₃). If E were O₃, its symmetry group would be C2v. Ozone is a toxic gas, fitting the description of E as extremely hazardous.
- **Other options**: C2 and D4h do not align with the likely molecular structures of E based on the reactions.

Given the evidence, E is most likely ozone (O₃), which has a bent structure and C2v symmetry. This aligns with the description of E as extremely hazardous and the molecular geometry implied by the reactions.
