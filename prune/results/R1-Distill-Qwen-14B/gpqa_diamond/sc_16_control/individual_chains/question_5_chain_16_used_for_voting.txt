Okay, I'm a bit new to quantum mechanics, but I'll try to work through this problem step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. So I'm looking for a vector that, when the operator P acts on it, gives the same vector multiplied by ħ/2.

Wait, the operator P is given in terms of its components P_x, P_y, and P_z. So the total operator P is a vector operator, and I think it's given as P = (P_x, P_y, P_z). But wait, for a spin-½ particle, the components would be along different directions. Oh, right, the Pauli matrices come into play here.

Given that each component is given as (ħ/2) multiplied by a 2x2 matrix. Let me write down each component:

P_x is (ħ/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]].
P_y is (ħ/2) * [[0, -i],[i, 0]].
P_z is (ħ/2) * [[1,0],[0,-1]].

So each component is a Pauli matrix multiplied by ħ/2. So the operator P is the vector sum of these components multiplied by the direction vector n. Wait, the operator is along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. So n is in the x-z plane, meaning that it can be expressed as (n_x, 0, n_z), since y-component is zero.

So the direction vector can be written as a unit vector. Since it's in the x-z plane, the angle θ would be measured from the z-axis. So n_x = sinθ * cosφ, and n_z = cosθ. But wait, since the direction is in the x-z plane, φ would be zero or pi if it's along x or some angle in between. Wait, no, wait: in spherical coordinates, the x-z plane corresponds to φ = 0 or π, because the azimuthal angle φ is measured from the x-axis. Wait, no, I might be mixing up. Wait, usually φ is the angle around the z-axis, so in the x-z plane, φ is 0 or π. Or perhaps I should think in terms of just the angle θ from the z-axis. So the direction vector n would be (sinθ, 0, cosθ)? Wait, no, because in the x-z plane, it's better to represent it as (n_x, 0, n_z), with n_x^2 + n_z^2 = 1.

So the operator P along direction n would be P · n, which is P_x * n_x + P_y * n_y + P_z * n_z. But since n_y is zero, that term drops out. So P_n = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

So let me write P_n as n_x (ħ/2) σ_x + n_z (ħ/2) σ_z, where σ_x and σ_z are the Pauli matrices for x and z.

The eigenvalue equation is P_n |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>, because the eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2.

So (n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z) |ψ> = (1/2) |ψ>, because ħ/2 times (n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z) would give the operator, and the eigenvalue is ħ/2, but when divided by ħ, it's (n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z) |ψ> = (1/2) |ψ> ?

Wait, let me re-express P_n. P_n is (ħ/2)(n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z), because P_x is (ħ/2)σ_x, and same for P_z. So the operator is (ħ/2)(n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z). The eigenvalue equation is P_n |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>, so:

(ħ/2)(n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z) |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>

We can cancel out ħ/2 from both sides:

(n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z) |ψ> = |ψ>

So the eigenvalue equation for the matrix (n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z) is 1.

So the matrix we're looking at is:

n_x * [[0,1],[1,0]] + n_z * [[1,0],[0,-1]] = [[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]]

Wait, because when you add n_x σ_x and n_z σ_z, the σ_x part adds 1 to the off-diagonal elements, and σ_z part adds 1 and -1 to the diagonal.

So the matrix is [[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]].

We can write this as a 2x2 matrix M:

M = [ [n_z, n_x],
       [n_x, -n_z] ]

We need to find the eigenvectors of M with eigenvalue 1.

Eigenvectors satisfy (M - I) |v> = 0, where I is the identity matrix.

So M - I = [[n_z - 1, n_x], [n_x, -n_z -1]]

The equation (M - I) |v> = 0 gives the system of equations:

(n_z -1) v1 + n_x v2 = 0
n_x v1 + (-n_z -1) v2 = 0

Let me write these as:

(n_z -1) v1 = -n_x v2   --> equation 1
n_x v1 = (n_z +1) v2    --> equation 2

From equation 2, v1 = [(n_z +1)/n_x] v2, assuming n_x is not zero.

But wait, if n_x is zero, then the direction is along z. But the problem says it's in the x-z plane, so n_x could be zero, but in general, let's proceed assuming n_x is not zero (we can check that case separately).

Substituting v1 from equation 2 into equation 1:

(n_z -1) * [(n_z +1)/n_x v2 ] + n_x v2 = 0

Let me compute this:

[(n_z -1)(n_z +1) ) / n_x ] v2 + n_x v2 =0

(n_z² -1) / n_x v2 + n_x v2 =0

Factor out v2:

[ (n_z² -1) + n_x² ] / n_x * v2 = 0

Since v2 can't be zero (else v1 would also be zero, leading to a trivial solution), the numerator must be zero:

(n_z² -1) + n_x² =0

But n_x² + n_z² =1, since n is a unit vector. So substituting:

(1 - n_x²) -1 + n_x² =0 --> 0=0.

So the equation holds. Therefore, equation 2 is sufficient, and the eigenvectors are any scalar multiples of [ (n_z +1)/n_x , 1 ].

Wait, because from equation 2, v1 = (n_z +1)/n_x * v2.

So the eigenvector can be written as [v1, v2] = [ (n_z +1)/n_x * v2, v2 ]

We can choose v2 =1 for simplicity, so the eigenvector is [ (n_z +1)/n_x , 1 ].

Wait, but n_x is sqrt(1 - n_z^2), because n_x^2 + n_z^2 =1. Since n is in the x-z plane, and a unit vector, n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ, where θ is the angle from the z-axis.

So n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ.

So substituting, the vector becomes [ (cosθ +1 )/(sinθ), 1 ]

Hmm, perhaps I can simplify this expression.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write the vector as [ (n_z +1)/n_x , 1 ].

But we can also factor out 1 from the first component.

Wait, let's compute (n_z +1) = 2 cos²(θ/2), and n_x = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2), using the trigonometric identities:

cosθ = 1 - 2 sin²(θ/2) → Wait, no, wait.

Wait, cosθ = 2 cos²(θ/2) -1 → so 1 + cosθ = 2 cos²(θ/2)
sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2)

So (n_z +1) = 2 cos²(θ/2)
n_x = sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2)

So (n_z +1)/n_x = [2 cos²(theta/2)] / [2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2)] ] = [cos(theta/2)] / [sin(theta/2)] = cot(theta/2) = tan(pi/2 - theta/2 )

So the first component is cot(theta/2), and the second component is 1.

So the vector is [ cot(theta/2), 1 ]

But perhaps I can write this in terms of sin and cos of theta/2.

Let me factor cot(theta/2) as cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2).

So the vector is [ cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2), 1 ]

Alternatively, we can write it as [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ] multiplied by 1/sin(theta/2), but that depends on how it's normalized.

Wait, let's check normalization. The eigenvector must be normalized, so the sum of the squares of the absolute values of the components should be 1.

The components are (n_z +1)/n_x and 1. So let's compute the square:

|v1|^2 + |v2|^2 = [ (n_z +1)^2 / n_x^2 ] + 1.

But since n_x^2 = 1 - n_z^2, let's substitute that.

= [ (n_z +1)^2 ] / (1 - n_z^2) ) + 1.

Wait, 1 - n_z^2 = (1 - n_z)(1 + n_z). So,

= [ (n_z +1)^2 ] / [ (1-n_z)(1+n_z) ) ] + 1
= [ (n_z +1)^2 ) ] / [ (1 - n_z)(1 + n_z) ) ] + 1
= [ (n_z +1) ] / (1 - n_z) ) + 1
= [ (n_z +1) + (1 - n_z) ) ] / (1 - n_z)
= [ 2 ] / (1 - n_z )

Wait, that's [ (n_z +1) / (1 - n_z) ) ] + 1 = [ (n_z +1) + (1 - n_z) ) ]/(1 - n_z) )? Wait, no, perhaps I made a mistake in the algebra.

Wait, let me compute [ (n_z +1)^2 ] / (1 - n_z^2 ) + 1.

Wait, (a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2. So:

(n_z +1)^2 = n_z^2 + 2n_z +1.

Denominator is (1 - n_z^2) = (1 - n_z)(1 + n_z).

So,

= (n_z^2 + 2n_z +1) / [ (1 - n_z)(1 + n_z) ) ] +1

The numerator can be written as (n_z + 1)^2, which is (1 + n_z)^2.

So,

= (1 + n_z)^2 / [ (1 - n_z)(1 + n_z) ) ] +1

= (1 + n_z) / (1 - n_z) ) + 1

= [ (1 + n_z) + (1 - n_z) ) ] / (1 - n_z) )
= (2) / (1 - n_z )

Wait, but that can't be right because the denominator is (1 - n_z), and the sum would be 2/(1-n_z) plus 1? No, wait, no, because it's:

[ (n_z +1)^2 ] / (1 - n_z^2 ) + 1 = [ (n_z+1)^2 ] / ( (1-n_z)(1+n_z) )) +1 = [ (n_z+1) / (1-n_z) ) ] +1.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the addition. Let me compute it again.

Let me compute [(n_z+1)^2 / (1-n_z^2)] + 1.

= [ (n_z^2 + 2n_z +1) ) / ( (1 - n_z)(1 + n_z) ) ] + 1

= [ ( (n_z +1)^2 ) / ( (1 -n_z)(1+n_z) ) ) ] +1

= [ (n_z +1) / (1 -n_z) ) ] +1

= [ (n_z +1) + (1 -n_z) ) ] / (1 -n_z )

= [ 2 ] / (1 -n_z )

Wait, so the sum is 2/(1 -n_z).

Hmm, but for the vector to be normalized, we need |v1|^2 + |v2|^2 =1.

So the magnitude squared is 2/(1 -n_z) =1.

Wait, that can't be right, because unless 1 -n_z=2, which would require n_z=-1. That's only when θ=pi radians, i.e., direction is along negative z-axis.

Wait, but that's a problem. It suggests that the vector I've found isn't normalized except in that case. So perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier steps.

Wait, let's think again. The eigenvector we found is [ (n_z +1)/n_x , 1 ]

But the magnitude squared is [ (n_z +1)^2 /n_x^2 + 1 ]

But since n_x^2 =1 - n_z^2,

So [ (n_z +1)^2 ] / (1 -n_z^2 ) +1.

Wait, let me compute the first term:

(n_z +1)^2 / (1 -n_z^2 ) = (n_z +1)^2 / [ (1 -n_z)(1 +n_z) ) ] = (n_z +1)/(1 -n_z )

So the magnitude squared is (n_z +1)/(1 -n_z) +1 = [ (n_z +1) + (1 -n_z) ] / (1 -n_z ) = 2/(1 -n_z )

So the magnitude is sqrt(2/(1 -n_z)).

So to normalize, we need to divide by this magnitude. So the normalized eigenvector is:

[ (n_z +1)/n_x , 1 ] / sqrt(2/(1 -n_z)) )

Wait, but perhaps there's a better way to write this in terms of θ.

Since n_z =cosθ, and n_x = sinθ,

So the vector is [ (cosθ +1)/sinθ, 1 ] divided by sqrt( 2/(1 - cosθ) )

Wait, 1 - cosθ = 2 sin^2(theta/2), so sqrt(2/(1 - cosθ)) ) = sqrt(2/(2 sin^2(theta/2))) ) = sqrt(1/(sin^2(theta/2))) ) = 1/|sin(theta/2)|.

Assuming sin(theta/2) is positive (since theta is between 0 and pi, I think). So, it's 1/sin(theta/2).

So the normalized vector becomes:

[ (cosθ +1)/sinθ , 1 ] * (1/(1/sin(theta/2))) )

Wait, wait, let me compute each component after normalization.

First, [ (cosθ +1)/sinθ ] / [ sqrt(2/(1 - cosθ)) ]

Which is [ (cosθ +1)/sinθ ] * [ sqrt( (1 - cosθ)/2 ) ]

Similarly, the second component is 1 / sqrt(2/(1 - cosθ)) ) = sqrt( (1 - cosθ)/2 )

Let me compute the first component:

(cosθ +1) * sqrt( (1 - cosθ)/2 ) / sinθ

Hmm, perhaps using trigonometric identities can help here.

We know that 1 - cosθ = 2 sin^2(theta/2), and 1 + cosθ = 2 cos^2(theta/2).

So cosθ +1 = 2 cos^2(theta/2)

Also, sinθ = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2)

So substituting into the first component:

(2 cos^2(theta/2)) * sqrt( (2 sin^2(theta/2))/2 ) ) / (2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) )

Wait, let me compute each part step by step.

Numerator of first component:

(2 cos^2(theta/2)) * sqrt( (2 sin^2(theta/2))/2 )

Wait, (1 - cosθ)/2 = sin²(theta/2), so sqrt gives sin(theta/2).

So first component becomes:

[ 2 cos²(theta/2) ] * [ sin(theta/2) ] 

Denominator is sinθ = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2)

So [2 cos²(theta/2) * sin(theta/2) ] / [2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) ]

Simplify numerator and denominator:

The 2 cancels, sin(theta/2) cancels, cos(theta/2) in numerator and denominator gives cos(theta/2).

So first component becomes cos(theta/2).

Second component was sqrt( (1 - cosθ)/2 ) = sin(theta/2).

So the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Wait, that's a neat result! So the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

But wait, let me double-check. When I have the unnormalized vector as [ (n_z +1)/n_x, 1 ], which becomes [ (cosθ +1)/sinθ, 1 ].

After normalization, I get [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

So the eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Wait, but what about the phase? Because in quantum mechanics, the eigenvectors can have a phase factor, but the components are determined up to a global phase. But in this case, perhaps the eigenvector is correct.

Now, looking back at the options:

Option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Option D is (sqrt(2/3) hbar cos(theta/2), sqrt(1/3) hbar sin(theta/2)), but that seems to involve hbar and sqrt factors which don't match.

Wait, but wait, the initial eigenvector is [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)].

But looking at the options, option C matches this exactly.

But wait, the question says "the normalized eigenvector". So option C is a possibility.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the direction. Because spin-½ particles have spin-up and spin-down states. The direction along n would have the spin-up state as the eigenvector with eigenvalue +ħ/2.

Another approach: The eigenstates for spin along a direction n can be written as |+n> = cos(theta/2)|+z> + e^{i phi} sin(theta/2)|-z>.

Wait, but in our case, since n is in the x-z plane, phi is zero, so it's |+n> = cos(theta/2)|+z> + sin(theta/2)|-z>.

Wait, but the standard basis for spin-z is |+z> = [1; 0], |−z> = [0;1].

So |+n> would be [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Which is exactly the result I got earlier. So option C is correct.

Looking at the options:

Option C: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Yes, that's the normalized eigenvector.

So the correct answer should be option C.

To solve the problem, we are tasked with finding the normalized eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator $\vec{P}$ for a muon along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The operator $\vec{P}$ is given in terms of its components $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$, which are proportional to the Pauli matrices $\sigma_x$, $\sigma_y$, and $\sigma_z$, respectively. The direction $\vec{n}$ is expressed as $(n_x, 0, n_z)$, where $n_x = \sin\theta$ and $n_z = \cos\theta$, since $\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane and is a unit vector.

The operator $\vec{P}$ along $\vec{n}$ is given by:

\[
P_n = n_x P_x + n_z P_z = \frac{\hbar}{2} \left( n_x \sigma_x + n_z \sigma_z \right).
\]

The eigenvalue equation is:

\[
P_n | \psi \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} | \psi \rangle.
\]

Substituting $P_n$, we find:

\[
\frac{\hbar}{2} \left( n_x \sigma_x + n_z \sigma_z \right) | \psi \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} | \psi \rangle.
\]

Dividing through by $\hbar/2$, the eigenvalue equation simplifies to:

\[
\left( n_x \sigma_x + n_z \sigma_z \right) | \psi \rangle = | \psi \rangle.
\]

The matrix representation of $n_x \sigma_x + n_z \sigma_z$ is:

\[
M = \begin{bmatrix}
n_z & n_x \\
n_x & -n_z
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvalue equation $(M - I)|\psi\rangle = 0$ gives the system of equations:

\[
(n_z - 1)v_1 + n_x v_2 = 0, \quad n_x v_1 + (-n_z - 1)v_2 = 0.
\]

From the second equation, $v_1 = \frac{n_z + 1}{n_x} v_2$. Substituting this into the first equation confirms that the eigenvector is proportional to:

\[
| \psi \rangle = \begin{bmatrix} \frac{n_z + 1}{n_x} \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Using trigonometric identities, $n_z = \cos\theta$ and $n_x = \sin\theta$, we rewrite the eigenvector as:

\[
| \psi \rangle = \begin{bmatrix} \frac{\cos\theta + 1}{\sin\theta} \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Simplifying further using $\cos\theta + 1 = 2\cos^2(\theta/2)$ and $\sin\theta = 2\sin(\theta/2)\cos(\theta/2)$, the eigenvector becomes:

\[
| \psi \rangle = \begin{bmatrix} \cos(\theta/2) \\ \sin(\theta/2) \end{bmatrix}.
\]

This is already normalized, as $\cos^2(\theta/2) + \sin^2(\theta/2) = 1$. Comparing this result with the options:

- **Option A**: Incorrect, as it introduces unnecessary factors of $\hbar$ and does not match the derived components.
- **Option B**: Incorrect, as it introduces an $e^{i\phi}$ factor, which is not present in the solution since $\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane.
- **Option C**: Correct, as it matches the derived normalized eigenvector $(\cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2))$.
- **Option D**: Incorrect, as it introduces additional normalization factors and $\hbar$ terms that are not present in the solution.

Thus, the normalized eigenvector is given by **Option C**.

Answer: C
