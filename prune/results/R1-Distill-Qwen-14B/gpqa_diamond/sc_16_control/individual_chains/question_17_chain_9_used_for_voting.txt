Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, let me read it again carefully. The question says the solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25 °C. The given K for the Ca-EDTA complex is 5x10^10. The options are A to D, and I need to pick the right one.

Wait, I'm a bit rusty on EDTA complexes. So, EDTA is a chelating agent, right? It binds metal ions in a 1:1 ratio, forming a complex. The K here is the formation constant, which is the equilibrium constant for the reaction where metal and EDTA form the complex.

So, the reaction should be something like Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2−. The K for this would be [CaEDTA^2−]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]) = 5e10. 

But wait, the problem says the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M. That would imply that the solution is made by dissolving the complex, which dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA^4- in solution. So, let's model that.

Let me denote the concentration of the complex as [CaEDTA^2−] = 0.02 M. Since the complex dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-, each at a concentration 'x'. So, [Ca²+] = x and [EDTA^4-] = x. 

The equilibrium expression is K = [CaEDTA^2−]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]) = (0.02) / (x * x) ) = 0.02 / x². 

And we know K is 5e10. So:

5e10 = 0.02 / x²

Solving for x²: x² = 0.02 / (5e10) 

0.02 is 2e-2. So,

x² = (2e-2) / (5e10) = (2/5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13.

Taking square root, x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5? No, wait, 4e-13 is 4 * 10^-13, square root is sqrt(4)=2, sqrt(1e-13)=1e-6.5, which is 3.16e-7. Wait, 1e-13 is (1e-6.5)^2. So, sqrt(1e-13)=1e-6.5 = approx 3.16e-7. So, x is 2 * 3.16e-7 = 6.32e-7 M. 

Looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7. That seems right. Let me check the calculations again.

Another way: K=5e10 = 0.02/(x²) → x² = 0.02 / (5e10) = (2e-2)/(5e10) )= (2/5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12 → x² = 4e-13 → x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5 → 2 * (3.16e-7) → 6.32e-7 M. So yes, option C is the correct answer.

Wait, but wait another thing. The problem states that the solution contains 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. So, we're assuming that the complex dissociates into its ions. Are there any other factors I'm missing? Like activity coefficients or pH affecting the EDTA's form? Oh, but the problem says pH is ideal, so I guess we don't have to worry about the different forms of EDTA (like HnY). So, the assumption is that EDTA is entirely in the Y^4- form, which is why the K is given as 5e10.

So, yes, the concentration of calcium ions is 6.3e-7 M, which is option C.

To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex, we use the equilibrium constant for the dissociation of the complex:

\[
\text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{4-} \leftrightarrow \text{CaEDTA}^{2-}, \quad K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = 5 \times 10^{10}.
\]

The equilibrium expression is:

\[
K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = \frac{[\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}.
\]

Given that the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M, we assume the dissociation produces equal concentrations of \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\) and \(\text{EDTA}^{4-}\), both equal to \(x\). Substituting into the equilibrium expression:

\[
K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = \frac{0.02}{x^2}.
\]

Rearranging for \(x^2\):

\[
x^2 = \frac{0.02}{K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}}} = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}} = \frac{2 \times 10^{-2}}{5 \times 10^{10}} = \frac{2}{5} \times 10^{-12} = 0.4 \times 10^{-12}.
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{0.4 \times 10^{-12}} = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} \approx 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}.
\]

Thus, the concentration of calcium ions is approximately \(6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}\), which corresponds to option C.
