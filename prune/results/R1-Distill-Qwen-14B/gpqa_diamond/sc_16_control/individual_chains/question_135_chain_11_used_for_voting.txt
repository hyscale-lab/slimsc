Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the possible decay channels of this boson X. I remember that when a particle decays, it has to produce particles that are kinematically allowed. That means the mass of X has to be at least twice the mass of the particles it's decaying into because each particle must have some kinetic energy.

The mass of X is given as 6 GeV. Let me think about the masses of the fermions. 

I know the masses of the quarks: up and down are the lightest, around 2-5 MeV each. Then strange is about 100 MeV, then charm around 1.5 GeV, bottom is about 4.5 GeV, top is super heavy, like 173 GeV. The leptons are lighter: electron is about 0.0005 GeV, muon is 0.1 GeV, tau is about 1.78 GeV.

So X is 6 GeV. For pair production, each particle needs to be less than half of that, which is 3 GeV. So any fermion pair with mass less than 3 GeV would be allowed.

Looking at quarks first: u and d are way below 3 GeV, so their pairs (uū, dd) are allowed. Strange is around 100 MeV, but wait, 2*100 MeV is 200 MeV, which is much less than 6 GeV. So ss̄ is allowed. What about charm quarks? Each is about 1.5 GeV. So two of them would sum to 3 GeV. Oh wait, 2 * 1.5 GeV is exactly 3 GeV. But wait, can they be produced? Because if the mass of X is 6 GeV, and the sum is 3 GeV, that's exactly the threshold. So production is allowed, but perhaps in some cases it's kinematically allowed but not preferred, but for decay possibilities, as long as the sum doesn't exceed, it's allowed. So yes, cc̄ is allowed.

Next, bottom quarks: each is about 4.5 GeV. 2 times that is 9 GeV, which is more than X's mass of 6 GeV. So bb̄ is not allowed. Same for tt̄, which is way over.

So among quarks, allowed are u, d, s, and c. So their pairs: uu, dd, ss, cc.

What about leptons? Electron and muon are very light. tau is about 1.78 GeV. So two taus would be around 3.56 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV. So taū is allowed. Electrons and muons are even lighter, so their pairs are definitely allowed. Mu+ mu- would be allowed as 2 * 0.1 GeV is 0.2 GeV. Similarly, electrons are negligible.

What about the other leptons? Like maybe neutrinos? Wait, but the interaction term given is between X and fermion fields. Looking at the Lagrangian: the term is -λ f f-bar X, where f is a fermion. So X can decay into any fermion-antifermion pair where the fermion is of the type that X interacts with. So we have to consider all possible fermions that X can interact with.

But the question is about kinematically allowed decays. So any fermion pair that has a combined mass less than or equal to 6 GeV.

So in the options, let's look:

Option A: includes b, s, u, d, tau, e pairs. But wait, b quark is 4.5 GeV, so bb̄ would require 9 GeV, which is more than 6. So that decay isn't allowed. So option A must be wrong because it includes bb̄.

Option B includes c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. So c is 1.5 GeV each, so 3 GeV for pair, which is allowed. Tau is 1.78, so 3.56 allowed. Mu is 0.1, so 0.2. So all these are allowed. B has X decaying into c c̄, which I think is allowed, but wait, what about the mass? 2*m(c) is 3 GeV, which X can do.

Option C: same as B, but includes t and tau. t is way too heavy, so tt̄ is not allowed. So C is out.

Option D: includes b, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. Again, bb̄ is 9 GeV, but X is 6 GeV. So bb̄ is not allowed. So D is wrong.

So the correct options must have only fermion pairs where 2m < 6 GeV.

Looking back, in the Lagrangian, the interaction is with fermions ψ_f. So I think X can decay into any of the fermion species that it couples to, as long as the mass is allowed.

So the possible decays would be into:

- u and ū: allowed (masses about 2 MeV each, sum 4 MeV)
- d and d̄: same as u, allowed
- s and s̄: 100 MeV each, sum 200 MeV
- c and c̄: 1.5 GeV each, sum 3 GeV
- tau+: tau-: 1.78 GeV each, sum ~3.56 GeV
- mu+ mu-: 0.1 GeV, sum 0.2
- e+ e-: negligible, sum ~0.

So which options include these? Let's see:

Option B includes c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. So that's correct.

Wait, what about the bottom quark in option B? No, option B's decay products don't include b; it's only c, s, u, d. So B is allowed.

Wait, let me check the options again.

Option A: includes b, which is not allowed. So A is out.

Option B: includes c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. So yes, that looks correct.

But wait, the mass of X is 6 GeV. For each pair, their combined mass must be less than or equal to 6 GeV.

Wait, let me compute for each pair:

c c̄: 2 * 1.5 = 3 GeV → allowed.

s s̄: 2 * 0.1 GeV (approx) → 0.2 GeV → allowed.

u ū: ~0.004 GeV → allowed.

d d̄: same as u, allowed.

tau+ tau-: 2 * 1.78 = 3.56 GeV → allowed.

mu+ mu-: 0.2 → allowed.

e+ e-: negligible → allowed.

So the allowed decays are into these pairs.

Looking at the options, option B lists all of these except for the top quark, which is not included anyway. So option B is correct.

Wait, but option B includes c c̄, which is allowed, right?

Yes, because 3 GeV is less than 6 GeV.

So the correct answer should be option B.

To determine the kinematically allowed decays of the boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV, we analyze the possible fermion-antifermion pairs it can decay into. A decay is allowed if the combined mass of the pair is less than or equal to the mass of \( X \), i.e., \( 2m_f \leq 6 \, \text{GeV} \), where \( m_f \) is the mass of the fermion.

### Fermion Masses:
- **Up quark (\( u \))**: \( m_u \approx 2 \, \text{MeV} \), so \( 2m_u \approx 4 \, \text{MeV} \) (allowed).
- **Down quark (\( d \))**: \( m_d \approx 5 \, \text{MeV} \), so \( 2m_d \approx 10 \, \text{MeV} \) (allowed).
- **Strange quark (\( s \))**: \( m_s \approx 100 \, \text{MeV} \), so \( 2m_s \approx 200 \, \text{MeV} \) (allowed).
- **Charm quark (\( c \))**: \( m_c \approx 1.5 \, \text{GeV} \), so \( 2m_c \approx 3 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
- **Bottom quark (\( b \))**: \( m_b \approx 4.5 \, \text{GeV} \), so \( 2m_b \approx 9 \, \text{GeV} \) (not allowed).
- **Top quark (\( t \))**: \( m_t \approx 173 \, \text{GeV} \), so \( 2m_t \approx 346 \, \text{GeV} \) (not allowed).
- **Tau lepton (\( \tau \))**: \( m_\tau \approx 1.78 \, \text{GeV} \), so \( 2m_\tau \approx 3.56 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
- **Muon (\( \mu \))**: \( m_\mu \approx 0.1 \, \text{GeV} \), so \( 2m_\mu \approx 0.2 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
- **Electron (\( e \))**: \( m_e \approx 0.0005 \, \text{GeV} \), so \( 2m_e \approx 0.001 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).

### Analysis of Options:
1. **Option A**: Includes \( b\bar{b} \), which requires \( 2m_b \approx 9 \, \text{GeV} \), exceeding \( X \)'s mass of 6 GeV. **Not allowed**.
2. **Option B**: Includes \( c\bar{c}, s\bar{s}, u\bar{u}, d\bar{d}, \tau^{+}\tau^{-}, \mu^{+}\mu^{-}, e^{+}e^{-} \). All these pairs have combined masses \( \leq 6 \, \text{GeV} \). **Allowed**.
3. **Option C**: Includes \( t\bar{t} \), which requires \( 2m_t \approx 346 \, \text{GeV} \), exceeding \( X \)'s mass of 6 GeV. **Not allowed**.
4. **Option D**: Includes \( b\bar{b} \), which requires \( 2m_b \approx 9 \, \text{GeV} \), exceeding \( X \)'s mass of 6 GeV. **Not allowed**.

### Conclusion:
The only kinematically allowed decays of \( X \) are listed in **Option B**, as all the included fermion pairs satisfy \( 2m_f \leq 6 \, \text{GeV} \).

**Answer: B**
