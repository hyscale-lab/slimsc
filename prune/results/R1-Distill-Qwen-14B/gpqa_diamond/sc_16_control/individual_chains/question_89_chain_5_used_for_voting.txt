Alright, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reactions. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember that adamantane has a diamondoid structure, kind of like a cage structure. So, 1,3-dibromo would mean there are bromine atoms on two of the bridgehead carbons. 

When this is heated with excess KOH, I think it's an elimination reaction. KOH is a strong base, so it probably deprotonates and abstracts a beta hydrogen, leading to the formation of an alkene. Since the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, each Br is on adjacent bridgehead carbons. So, when KOH removes a beta hydrogen from each Br, it should form a double bond between those two carbons. 

Wait, but in the structure, if the two Brs are on adjacent bridgeheads, eliminating two Hs (each from adjacent carbons) would form a double bond. So the product would be a diene or maybe a single double bond? Since there are two Br atoms, maybe each elimination leads to a double bond. So I'm thinking the product is 1,3-adamantadiene? Or perhaps it's 1,2-diene? Hmm, maybe I should draw the structure. Adamantane has four bridgehead carbons, I think, arranged in a chair-like structure. So 1 and 3 would be across from each other on the same face. Eliminating each Br would form a double bond between two bridgeheads, making a more strained structure? Or maybe it's a more stable diene.

Wait, but the product formed is a light yellow solid. The IR spectrum has a peak at 1720 cm^-1, which I think is a carbonyl group. Wait, 1720 is around where ketones appear, maybe esters or aldehydes. But wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane is reacting with KOH. If it's elimination, shouldn't it form an alkene? But the IR shows a carbonyl, which suggests maybe some oxidation or perhaps some rearrangement.

Wait, wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. When heating with KOH and excess, perhaps it's a Hofmann elimination? Or maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation followed by some other reaction. Alternatively, could it be a dieckmann condensation? No, that's for cyclic esters.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the KOH is causing both bromides to eliminate, but perhaps in a position that leads to a carbonyl. Hmm, that doesn't quite make sense. Alternatively, maybe the initial product is a diene, but under certain conditions, it could oxidize. Or perhaps the reaction isn't just elimination.

Wait, wait, the product's 1H NMR has a peak at 4.79 ppm (2H). That's a bit downfield, maybe for an -OH group, but the integration is 2H. Alternatively, maybe it's a CH2 group adjacent to an oxygen. Wait, 4.79 is in the range for an ether or maybe an alcohol. But looking at the other peaks: 2.41-2.23 (10H) – those are probably the adamantane bridge CH2 groups. 1.94 (2H) – maybe a CH2 adjacent to something else, like an oxygen.

Wait, but the IR's 1720 cm^-1 is a strong peak for a carbonyl. So maybe the product is an epoxide? Wait, no, epoxides don't have carbonyl peaks. Alternatively, maybe it's a ketone.

Wait, let me think again. 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH. KOH is a strong base and a good nucleophile. So perhaps each Br is replaced by an -O- group. Wait, but that would require a substitution reaction. However, since it's heated, elimination is more likely. So perhaps it's a double elimination, forming a double bond. But the IR suggests a carbonyl.

Wait, another thought: maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation leading to an alkene, but perhaps in the structure, the double bond is adjacent to a carbonyl group. Hmm, that doesn't quite fit. Alternatively, perhaps the KOH is causing oxidation. Wait, but KOH is a base, not an oxidizing agent. Unless it's in an aqueous solution with something else, but the problem doesn't mention that.

Wait, maybe the product is an epoxide. Epoxides have a ring with an oxygen, and their IR would show a strong peak around 1200-1300 cm^-1 for the C-O stretch. But 1720 is more like a carbonyl. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the initial reaction is a double elimination. 1,3-dibromoadamantane with two Brs on adjacent carbons. When KOH is added, each Br leaves, leading to a double bond. So the product would be 1,3-adamantadiene. But that wouldn't explain the 1720 cm^-1 IR peak. Unless there's some sort of conjugation or another functional group.

Alternatively, maybe the product is a diketone. But how would that form from a dibromide with KOH? Unless there's some kind of oxidation, but KOH is not oxidizing.

Wait, another angle. Let's think about the NMR. The product 1 has a peak at 4.79 ppm (2H). That could be a CH2 group next to an oxygen, maybe an ether or an alcohol. The 1.94 ppm (2H) could be a CH2 adjacent to an oxygen or another electronegative group. The 2.41-2.23 (10H) is probably the adamantane's internal CH2 groups, which are usually around 2.0-2.5 ppm.

But then the IR carbonyl suggests a ketone or another carbonyl-containing group. So maybe the product is a ketone. But how?

Wait, perhaps the initial reaction is a elimination to form a carbonyl. Wait, elimination of HBr from 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Wait, each Br is on adjacent carbons: so eliminating two HBr molecules would form a double bond between those two carbons. That would form an alkene. But that wouldn't give a carbonyl.

Ah, but wait, maybe this is a case of vicinal dihalide elimination. When a vicinal dihalide (like 1,2-dibromoethane) reacts with a strong base like KOH, it can eliminate to form an alkene. So for 1,3-dibromoadamantane, which is a vicinal dihalide in the adamantane structure, elimination would form a double bond.

But that doesn't explain the IR peak. So perhaps the product isn't a double bond but something else. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the product is a cyclic ether. If KOH attacks each Br, causing a substitution, perhaps leading to an epoxide. But wait, in a vicinal dihalide, substitution would form a diol if you have two substitutions (SN2 perhaps), but elimination would form an alkene, substitution would require a good leaving group and perhaps a good solvent.

Wait, but if KOH is present in excess, and the reaction is heated, it's more likely an elimination. So maybe the product is an alkene, but how does that tie to the IR? Oh wait, perhaps the product is a conjugated diene, and the IR is showing something else.

Wait, maybe the product isn't an alkene. Let me think again. The IR peak is at 1720 cm^-1, which is a strong carbonyl. That suggests maybe a ketone is formed. So perhaps, the reaction is an oxidation. But KOH isn't an oxidizing agent. Unless... wait, perhaps the reaction is a Baeyer-Villiger oxidation? No, that requires a ketone to begin with, which we don't have here.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the reaction forms a carbonyl via elimination. For example, if the base abstracts a proton beta to the Br, leading to the formation of a carbonyl group. But wait, that's usually a ketone or aldehyde. So perhaps, each Br is replaced by a carbonyl group? But that would require two eliminations, each leading to a carbonyl.

Wait, but that's impossible because each elimination from a vicinal dihalide would form a double bond, not a carbonyl. Unless the reaction is a complete elimination, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the product is a cyclic ketone. But how? Maybe the structure rearranges. Alternatively, maybe the product is an epoxide, but I'm not seeing the connection.

Alternatively, maybe the product is an ether. If two alcohols are formed, perhaps they lose water to form an ether. But wait, the product is from KOH and dibromide. So elimination of HBr twice would form a double bond, but if each Br is replaced by an -O- group, perhaps forming an epoxide. Wait, but in that case, each Br would have to be replaced by an oxygen, which would require an SN2 mechanism. But for adamantane, the structure is quite rigid, so SN2 is unlikely on the bridgehead carbons. 

Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts a proton, leading to an elimination of HBr, forming a carbene? Wait, no, that's probably not happening here.

Hmm, perhaps I'm stuck on this first part. Let's move to the next step and see if that helps.

Product 1 is then heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide, forming product 2. Aluminum isopropoxide is a Lewis acid catalyst, often used in Friedel-Crafts alkylation and acylation. Since product 1 has a carbonyl group (as per IR), perhaps product 1 is a ketone.

So, if product 1 is a ketone, then heating with Al isopropoxide (Al(OiPr)3) might lead to some kind of acylation. Maybe product 1 is an ester, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but product 2 is then subjected to ozone at -78°C, followed by dimethyl sulfide. Ozone is used for ozonolysis, which cleaves alkenes into carbonyl compounds. So product 2 must have a double bond. Because ozonolysis acts on alkenes.

So, product 2 must have a double bond. That suggests that product 1, after reaction with KOH, may not have a double bond, but after reaction with Al isopropoxide, product 2 does.

Let me retrace: 

1,3-dibromoadamantane → product 1 (heated with KOH). So product 1 is a carbonyl-containing compound.

Then product 1 is heated with excess Al isopropoxide. If product 1 is a ketone, perhaps the Al isopropoxide helps in some kind of acylation, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe product 1 is an alcohol, and the Al isopropoxide is part of a dehydration to form an alkene.

Wait, if product 1 is an alcohol, then heating with a Lewis acid could facilitate elimination (like E1 or E2 mechanism) to form an alkene. So product 2 would be an alkene.

That makes sense. So the sequence would be:

1,3-dibromoadamantane → (KOH, heat) → product 1 (diol or something with OH groups) → (Al(OiPr)3, heat) → product 2 (alkene via elimination) → ozonolysis → product 3.

But wait, let me think again: If product 1 has OH groups, then heating with a Lewis acid like Al isopropoxide could dehydrate them to form a double bond.

So product 1 has hydroxyl groups, possibly on adjacent bridgehead carbons, leading to product 2 having a double bond.

Wait, but product 1's IR shows a peak at 1720 cm^-1, which suggests a carbonyl. So maybe product 1 is a ketone. Then, product 2 would be formed by some reaction of the ketone with Al isopropoxide. Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diol, and product 2 is an alkene formed by dehydration.

But how does product 1 have a carbonyl? Maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me try to think of other reactions.

Wait, another approach: 1,3-dibromoadamantane when heated with KOH could eliminate HBr twice to form an allene, a compound with two adjacent double bonds. But adamantane's structure is rigid, so maybe forming a conjugated diene is more plausible.

But if product 1 is a diene, then how does it explain the IR peak at 1720 cm^-1? Unless the diene has some conjugation with a carbonyl group, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the initial reaction forms a cyclic ether, which would have a carbonyl-like IR? No, cyclic ether would have peaks around 1200-1300 cm^-1.

Hmm, this is getting confusing. Let me try to think of alternative possibilities. Maybe the first reaction isn't elimination but substitution. If KOH causes substitution, each Br could be replaced by an -OH group, forming 1,3-diol. Then the product 1 would be 1,3-adamantane diol. The IR would then show O-H stretching, but the given IR shows a carbonyl. So that's probably not it.

Wait, but the NMR of product 1 shows a peak at 4.79 ppm (2H). If it's a diol, the OH protons would show broad peaks around 1-5 ppm. But they might be exchanging and not appear in the NMR. Alternatively, the 4.79 ppm could be a CH2 next to an O, perhaps in an ether.

Wait, maybe product 1 is an epoxide. Epoxides have two CH2 groups adjacent to oxygen. The NMR would show up around 3-4 ppm. But the 4.79 is a bit high for an epoxide's CH2. Alternatively, if the epoxide is part of a more complex structure, maybe the protons are deshielded more.

But then, the IR would show the C-O stretch of the epoxide, which is around 1200-1300 cm^-1. So the 1720 would be another functional group. Hmm, perhaps an ester or a ketone.

Wait, perhaps the initial reaction forms a diketone. But how? 1,3-dibromoadamantane to diketone would require oxidation, but KOH isn't an oxidizing agent. Unless it's an elimination followed by some rearrangement.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the reaction is a double elimination, forming a conjugated diene, and that diene is then oxidized to a di-ketone. But KOH isn't an oxidizing agent. So that's probably not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a single elimination, forming a mono-alkene, but then why the IR peak?

Wait, perhaps the product isn't a di-substituted compound but something else. Maybe it's a cyclopropane ring opening? No, that's probably not.

I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to think about product 2 and the ozonolysis.

Product 2 is treated with ozone and then dimethyl sulfide, which usually indicates ozonolysis of an alkene to form carbonyl groups. So product 2 must have a double bond.

So, product 2 is an alkene. How is product 2 formed from product 1?

If product 1 is a diol (from substitution), then heating with Al isopropoxide (a strong Lewis acid) could lead to an elimination, forming an alkene. So product 1 is 1,3-adamantane diol, which upon treatment with Al isopropoxide, undergoes dehydration to form a diene or a mono-alkene.

Wait, but the diol would have two OH groups on adjacent bridgehead carbons. Dehydration would form a double bond between them, leading to a more stable structure. So product 2 would be 1,2-adamantadiene or something similar.

But then, product 1's IR shows a carbonyl, which wouldn't fit with a diol. Unless I'm missing something.

Alternatively, product 1 is a ketone, and product 2 is an alkene formed via some mechanism. Maybe via a conjugate addition or something else. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a ketone, and Al isopropoxide is used in a Friedel-Crafts type acylation, but adamantane is not aromatic, so that's unlikely.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is a carbonyl compound, and Al isopropoxide is acting as a catalyst for some kind of elimination. If product 1 is a carbonyl and has adjacent hydroxyl groups, heating with Al isopropoxide could cause elimination to form an alkene adjacent to the carbonyl, leading to a conjugated enone.

Wait, that could make sense. So product 1 is a ketone with adjacent OH groups. Then, heating with a Lewis acid could dehydrate the OH groups, forming a double bond next to the ketone, creating an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone (enone). So product 2 would be an enone.

Then, ozonolysis of the double bond in product 2 would cleave the double bond. Ozonolysis typically breaks double bonds into carbonyl groups. So in product 3, the double bond would be cleaved, forming two carbonyl groups.

Wait, but in enones, the double bond is conjugated with the carbonyl. Ozonolysis of an enone would lead to cleavage and formation of two carbonyl compounds. 

But let me think about the structure of product 2. If it's an enone, the structure would be: R-CO-CH2-CH2-R'? No, wait, an enone would be R-CO-CH2-CH2-R' with a double bond between the CH2 groups. No, wait, the enone is R-CO-CH2-CH2-R' with a double bond between the carbonyl and the next carbon, like R-CO-CH2-CH2-R' → R-CO-CH2-CH2-R' would not have a double bond. Oh wait, the enone has a double bond between the carbonyl carbon and the adjacent one. So structure like R-C=O-CH2-CH2-R' wouldn't be an enone. Wait, no, the enone is R-CO-CH2-CH2-R' with a double bond between the two CH2 groups? Or wait, no, the enone is R-CO-CH2-CH2-R' would have a conjugated double bond. No, wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Enones are compounds with a conjugated double bond adjacent to a carbonyl group, like R-CO-CH2-CH2-R' → no, that doesn't have a double bond. Oh wait, an enone is R-CO-CH2-CH2-R' but with a double bond between the two CH2 carbons. So R-CO-CH2-CH2-R' would become R-CO-CH2-CH2-R' with a double bond between the CH2 groups, making R-CO-CH2-CH2-R' → no, that's not right. Wait, perhaps the correct structure is R-CO-CH2-CH2-R' but with the double bond between the carbonyl carbon and the next carbon. No, that's not possible because the carbonyl is a double bond.

Wait, I'm confusing myself. An enone is a compound with a ketone (CO) and an adjacent double bond. So the structure would be R-CO-CH2-CH2-R' with a double bond between the two CH2 groups. Or perhaps the double bond is between the carbonyl carbon and the adjacent one. Wait, no, the carbonyl is already a double bond. So the enone would have a conjugated double bond: R-CO-CH2-CH2-R' but that's not conjugated. Wait, maybe it's R-CO-CH2-CH2-R' with a double bond between the two CH2 groups, making R-CO-CH2-CH2-R' → no, that's a single bond.

Wait, perhaps the enone is R-CO-CH2-CH2-R' but with a double bond between the carbonyl and the first CH2. Oh wait, no, the carbonyl is already a double bond. So perhaps the structure is R-CO-CH=CH-R'. That makes sense. So the double bond is between the carbonyl and the next carbon. Then, ozonolysis would cleave that double bond.

So, for product 2, the enone structure would have a double bond adjacent to the carbonyl. Ozonolysis would break the double bond, and in the presence of dimethyl sulfide (which is a reductive workup), it would form carbonyl groups. So if product 2 is R-CO-CH2-CH2-R', ozonolysis would break the double bond (if any) but I'm getting confused again.

Wait, let's make this concrete. Product 2 is an enone, say, structure A: 

O
||
C-CH2-CH2-

But with a double bond between the two CH2 groups. Wait, no, I'm getting this wrong. Let me think of a specific example. Suppose product 2 is cyclohexenone: a six-membered ring with a ketone and a double bond conjugated to it. Ozonolysis would cleave the double bond, but in a conjugated dienone, it would break into two fragments.

But perhaps in this problem, the enone is more localized. Let's imagine product 2 has a structure like:

R-CO-CH2-CH2-R

with a double bond between the two CH2 groups. So, R-CO-CH2-CH2-R → no, that's not right. Wait, perhaps the structure is R-CO-CH2-CH2-R but with a double bond between the CH2 groups. So R-CO-CH2-CH2-R → no, that's single bonds. Alternatively, R-CO-CH=CH-R.

In that case, ozonolysis would cleave the double bond, breaking the molecule into two carbonyl compounds. So, for example, R-CO-CH=CH-R would become R-CO-CHO and another R-CO-CHO if it's symmetrical. But if the molecule is longer, it would form different products.

Wait, but in the case of product 3, which is the result of ozonolysis, the question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in its 1H NMR. The options are triplet, triplet of triplets, etc.

So, if product 3 is a di-ketone or has two aldehyde groups, the most deshielded protons would be on the carbonyl groups. For example, aldehyde protons typically appear around 9-10 ppm as a singlet (if there's no coupling). But wait, the question specifies to exclude those that exchange with deuterated solvent, which might include OH or NH groups. Alternatively, maybe the deshielded protons are adjacent to carbonyls.

Wait, another possibility: after ozonolysis, the product could be a diketone, which doesn't have protons attached to the carbonyl. Alternatively, if the ozonolysis forms aldehydes, the aldehyde protons are deshielded but are usually singlets.

But the question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen, so perhaps it's not the aldehyde. Maybe the protons adjacent to the carbonyl groups.

Wait, let's think about product 3. Suppose product 2 is an enone like:

O
||
C-CH2-CH2-

But with a double bond between the two CH2 groups. So, structure would be O=C-CH2-CH2- with a double bond between the CH2 groups. Ozonolysis would cleave this into two carbonyl groups. For example, if the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-O=C, then ozonolysis would break the double bond, giving two carbonyl groups.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Let me think about the possible structure of product 3. If product 2 is an enone, then ozonolysis would cleave the double bond, producing two carbonyl compounds.

Suppose product 2 is a structure like:

R-CO-CH2-CH2-R

with a double bond between the two CH2 groups. Wait, no, that's not possible. Oh wait, perhaps product 2's structure is:

R-CO-CH2-CH2-R, but with a double bond between the two CH2 groups: R-CO-CH2-CH2-R → no, that's a single bond. Maybe the structure is R-CO-CH2-CH2-R with a double bond between the CH2 and the R group, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone, such as:

O
||
C-CH2-CH2-

But with a double bond between the carbonyl and the adjacent CH2, making it R-CO-CH2-CH2-R with a double bond between the carbonyl and the first CH2. So the structure is R-CO-CH2-CH2-R → no, that doesn't make sense because the double bond would be between the carbonyl carbon and the next carbon, making it R-CO-CH2-CH2-R → no, that's single bonds.

Wait, perhaps the structure is R-CO-CH2-CH2-R with a double bond between the two CH2 groups. So, R-CO-CH2-CH2-R → but with a double bond between the CH2s, making R-CO-CH2-CH2-R → but that's a diene? No, that's a single bond.

I think I'm stuck in a loop here. Let me try to think differently. The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3's NMR would be the one closest to an electronegative group, like oxygen. So perhaps it's a proton next to a carbonyl group.

If product 3 is a diketone, the protons adjacent to the carbonyl would be those on the CH2 groups next to the ketone. For example, in a structure like (CH2)2(CO)R, the protons on the CH2 next to the ketone would be deshielded.

But wait, in ozonolysis of a simple alkene, say R1R2C=CR3R4, the product would be R1R2CO and R3R4CO. So, if the alkene in product 2 is in such a position that ozonolysis produces two ketones, then product 3 would be two ketones.

But let's imagine that product 2 is a simple alkene, say, CH2=CH- something. Ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl groups. So, if product 2 is CH2=CH- something, product 3 would be two carbonyl compounds.

But in the case of adamantane-derived compounds, the structure after ozonolysis would depend on where the double bond is.

Wait, perhaps the ozonolysis of product 2, which is an ene structure, leads to two ketone groups. So product 3 would have two ketone groups, each adjacent to a CH2 group.

The most deshielded hydrogen would then be the one on the CH2 next to the ketone. So, in the NMR, those protons would be split based on their neighboring protons.

If the CH2 is next to a carbonyl group, the protons would be deshielded and possibly split by adjacent protons. For example, if each CH2 is adjacent to a carbonyl, and each CH2 is connected to another CH2 group, the splitting could be more complex.

Let me imagine the structure after ozonolysis: suppose product 3 has a structure like O=C-R-CH2-CH2-CO=O. Wait, no, that's a diester or diketone. Alternatively, maybe it's two separate carbonyl groups.

Wait, perhaps each carbonyl group is at the end of a chain, like O=C-(CH2)n-OH. But the question says to exclude Hs that exchange with solvent, so maybe we're looking at CH2 groups next to the carbonyls.

Let me think about the splitting. If each CH2 is next to a carbonyl and also connected to another CH2, the protons on the CH2 next to the carbonyl would couple with the adjacent CH2's protons.

Suppose the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-CO. Then, each CH2 next to the carbonyl (the first CH2) would have two neighboring protons on the adjacent CH2 group. So each proton on the first CH2 would see two neighboring protons, leading to a triplet.

Wait, but each CH2 has two protons, and they are next to another CH2 with two protons. So the first CH2's protons would be split by the neighboring CH2's two protons, resulting in a triplet. But wait, each H on the first CH2 is next to two Hs on the adjacent CH2. So the splitting would be a triplet.

But if the adjacent CH2 is split into a triplet by the first CH2, then the first CH2 would be a triplet as well. Alternatively, perhaps the coupling is more complex.

Wait, in a structure like O=C-CH2-CH2-CO, the protons on the CH2 next to the carbonyl (let's say positions 1 and 2) would each be adjacent to two protons on the next CH2 (positions 3 and 4). So each H in position 1 would couple with two Hs in position 2. So each H in position 1 would have a triplet (n+1, where n=2). But wait, in a CH2 group, each H is equivalent, so the splitting might be more about the neighboring groups.

Alternatively, perhaps the coupling is between the two CH2 groups. If the two CH2 groups are adjacent, each with two protons, the splitting could be more complex.

Wait, but in product 3, after ozonolysis, perhaps the structure is two separate carbonyl groups connected through a chain. For example, suppose product 3 is something like CH2(CO)R-CH2-(CO)R. In that case, the CH2 groups would be next to each other, each with two protons.

Each proton on the first CH2 would couple with the two protons on the adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet. Similarly, the protons on the second CH2 would also be triplets. But that's just for the first and second CH2 groups.

But wait, if the structure is more like CH2-CO and CH2-CO, separated by something else, then the coupling might be different. Alternatively, maybe the two CH2 groups are not adjacent, but maybe part of a longer chain.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the most deshielded proton is on a CH2 group next to a carbonyl, and that CH2 is adjacent to another CH2 which is next to another CH2, leading to a more complex splitting.

Wait, perhaps the splitting is a triplet of triplets. How would that happen? If each proton is coupled with two different sets of protons.

Suppose the most deshielded proton (on the CH2 next to the carbonyl) is coupled with two protons on one adjacent group and another two protons on another adjacent group, but that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, if the CH2 is adjacent to another CH2 which is adjacent to another CH2, then each proton would have coupling with two different sets. For example, the first CH2 is next to a CH2 with two Hs, and that CH2 is next to another CH2 with two Hs. So each H on the first CH2 would see 2 Hs from the adjacent CH2, and each of those Hs sees another 2 Hs, leading to a triplet of triplets.

Wait, let me think: the first CH2 (A) is next to the second CH2 (B), which is next to the third CH2 (C). Each H in A is coupled with two Hs in B. Each H in B is coupled with two Hs in A and two Hs in C. So, the Hs in A would have a triplet from coupling with B, and the Hs in B would have a triplet of triplets (if coupled with both A and C), but the question is about the most deshielded H, which would be the ones closest to the carbonyl, which are in A.

Wait, but in product 3, after ozonolysis, perhaps each CH2 is only coupled with one adjacent CH2. So, for the most deshielded H (on A), each H in A is coupled with two Hs in B, leading to a triplet.

Alternatively, if A is a CH2 next to a CH2 which is next to a CH2 which is next to another group, then the splitting could be more complex.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. But the options given are A) triplet, B) triplet of triplets, C) doublet of triplets, D) pentet.

If the most deshielded H is on a CH2 adjacent to a carbonyl, and that CH2 is next to another CH2 which is next to another CH2, then the coupling could be a triplet of triplets.

Wait, another angle: The coupling pattern depends on the number of neighboring protons. If the most deshielded H is on a CH2 next to a carbonyl, and that CH2 is next to another CH2 which has two Hs, then each H on the first CH2 would split into a triplet. But if the adjacent CH2 is itself next to another CH2, then each H in the first CH2 would couple with the two Hs in the adjacent CH2, making a triplet, but the adjacent CH2's Hs would also couple with their own neighbors, leading to more splitting.

But perhaps in product 3, the structure is such that each CH2 next to the carbonyl is adjacent to another CH2, which is adjacent to another CH2. So, for the first CH2 (next to carbonyl), each H is coupled with two Hs from the adjacent CH2. But those two Hs are each split by their own adjacent CH2. So the first CH2's Hs would have a triplet of triplets.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the most deshielded H is part of a CH2 group which is adjacent to another CH2, which is adjacent to another group with Hs. So, each H in the first CH2 would couple with two Hs in the adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet. But if the adjacent CH2 is itself split by another H, the overall splitting could be a triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, perhaps the most deshielded H is part of a CH2 group that's next to another CH2 which is next to a CH group with two Hs. Then, the splitting would be a triplet of triplets.

Wait, but I'm not entirely confident. Another approach: think about the options.

Option A is triplet. That would mean each H is coupled with two Hs, leading to three peaks.

Option B is triplet of triplets. So, each H is coupled with two groups of two Hs each. That would result in 3 x 3 = 9 peaks.

Option C is doublet of triplets. That would mean each H is coupled with two different sets, one with two Hs and another with two Hs, leading to 2 x 3 = 6 peaks.

Option D is a pentet, meaning each H is coupled with four Hs, perhaps from two adjacent groups each with two Hs, leading to 4 + 1 = 5 peaks.

In the case of product 3, if the most deshielded H is on a CH2 next to a carbonyl, and that CH2 is adjacent to another CH2 (with two Hs), then each H on the first CH2 would be split by the two Hs on the adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet. So the coupling pattern would be a triplet (option A). But wait, if the adjacent CH2 is itself next to another CH2, the splitting could be more complex.

Alternatively, if the most deshielded H is on a CH2 that is next to another CH2 (which is next to another CH2), each H on the first CH2 would couple with two Hs from the adjacent CH2, and those two Hs are each coupled with two Hs from the next CH2. So the first H would have a triplet from the first coupling, and each of those would be split again by the next coupling, leading to a triplet of triplets (option B).

But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the splitting is a triplet of triplets because each H is coupled with two Hs from one adjacent group and two Hs from another, leading to (2+2+1) peaks? No, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, if the H is on a CH2 next to a CH2 which is next to a CH group (with two Hs), then each H would be coupled with two Hs from the adjacent CH2 and two Hs from the CH group, making a triplet of triplets.

But I'm getting a bit stuck on this. Let me try to think of an example. Take the structure O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CO. So, each end is a ketone, and in between are three CH2 groups. The most deshielded H would be on the CH2 closest to the ketone.

Each H on that CH2 (let's say position 1) would be adjacent to two Hs on position 2. So each H in position 1 would couple with two Hs in position 2, leading to a triplet.

But what about the Hs in position 2? They are adjacent to position 1 and position 3. So each H in position 2 would couple with two Hs in position 1 and two Hs in position 3, leading to a triplet of triplets.

But the question is about the most deshielded H, which would be in position 1, which is a triplet.

Wait, but in this structure, the Hs in position 1 are only coupled with position 2, leading to a triplet. The Hs in position 2 are coupled with both position 1 and 3, leading to a triplet of triplets.

So, in this case, the most deshielded H (position 1) would be a triplet.

But the options include triplet as option A. So, perhaps the answer is A) triplet.

But I'm not entirely certain. Let me think again.

If product 3 has a structure where the most deshielded H is on a CH2 next to a carbonyl and adjacent to another CH2 with two Hs, the coupling would be a triplet. So, the answer would be A) triplet.

But wait, going back to the first part, perhaps I was wrong about product 2's structure.

Another approach: After ozonolysis, product 3 would have carbonyl groups. The NMR of product 3 would show the protons adjacent to these carbonyls. If those protons are on a CH2 group next to the carbonyl and adjacent to another CH2 group, their splitting would depend on the number of neighboring Hs.

So, in product 3, if we have a structure like O=C-CH2-CH2-X, then the Hs on the first CH2 (next to the carbonyl) would couple with the two Hs on the adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet.

Thus, the most deshielded H (on the CH2 next to the carbonyl) would be a triplet. So the answer is A) triplet.

The problem involves a multi-step reaction sequence starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Here's the analysis:

1. **Reaction with KOH**:  
   Heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with excess KOH likely results in elimination of two equivalents of HBr, forming a compound with a carbonyl group. The IR spectrum of the product (product 1) shows a strong absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹, consistent with a carbonyl group. The ¹H NMR spectrum of product 1 indicates a peak at 4.79 ppm (2H), which suggests a CH₂ group adjacent to an electronegative group (likely oxygen). The other peaks (2.41-2.23 ppm, 10H; 1.94 ppm, 2H) correspond to the adamantane backbone.

2. **Reaction with Al(isopropoxide)₃**:  
   Product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide, a Lewis acid. This likely facilitates dehydration of product 1, forming an α,β-unsaturated ketone (enone) as product 2. The double bond in the enone system is critical for the subsequent ozonolysis step.

3. **Ozonolysis**:  
   Ozonolysis of product 2 cleaves the double bond in the enone, forming product 3. The cleavage of the double bond adjacent to the carbonyl group results in two carbonyl-containing fragments. The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is likely on a CH₂ group adjacent to a carbonyl group.

4. **Coupling Pattern in Product 3**:  
   The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is on a CH₂ group next to a carbonyl. This CH₂ group is adjacent to another CH₂ group, which has two hydrogens. The coupling between the hydrogens on these two CH₂ groups results in a triplet pattern for the most deshielded hydrogen.

Critical analysis of the options:  
- **A) Triplet**: This is consistent with the most deshielded hydrogen coupling with two equivalent hydrogens on the adjacent CH₂ group.  
- **B) Triplet of triplets**: This would require coupling with two distinct sets of hydrogens, which is not supported by the structure.  
- **C) Doublet of triplets**: This would require coupling with one hydrogen and two equivalent hydrogens, which is not applicable here.  
- **D) Pentet**: This would require coupling with four equivalent hydrogens, which is not observed in the structure.

The most consistent coupling pattern for the most deshielded hydrogen is a triplet.
