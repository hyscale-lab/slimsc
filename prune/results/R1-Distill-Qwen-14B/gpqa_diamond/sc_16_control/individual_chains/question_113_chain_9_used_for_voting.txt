Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about identifying an unknown compound using various spectroscopic data. Hmm, let me think through this step by step. 

The question provides data from FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The goal is to figure out the chemical formula from the given options: C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, or C6H12O. The options are labeled A to D.

First, let's break down each piece of data.

Starting with the FTIR spectrum: a very broad absorption around 3000 cm^-1. Broad peaks around that region usually indicate O-H stretching. A broad peak suggests that the -OH group is probably in an alcohol (like an alcohol) or maybe a carboxylic acid, but carboxylic acids have a very broad and strong peak. Wait, but the other peaks are at 1700 and 1650. A peak at 1700 is indicative of a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, or maybe an ester or carboxylic acid. The 1650 peak could correspond to conjugated double bonds or maybe another carbonyl group. Wait, or maybe it's an aromatic ring with conjugated double bonds. Alternatively, the 1650 could be a conjugated carbonyl, like an ester or amide, or maybe an aromatic ring with substituents.

Wait, but if there are two strong peaks in the IR: 1700 and 1650. Hmm. Let me think. Maybe the 1700 is a carbonyl, like a ketone or ester, and 1650 could be an aromatic ring (C=C) or maybe an amide. Oh, but wait, another possibility: maybe the 1650 is due to conjugated carbonyl groups. Alternatively, if the compound has both a carbonyl and a conjugated double bond, like an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl. That would explain both peaks. So perhaps the structure has a conjugated system, like a carbonyl and a double bond nearby.

Next, the 1H NMR shows peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are those attached to a double bond, so that tells me the compound has a double bond. So that fits with the IR data if there's a conjugated double bond.

Now, the mass spectrum shows a fragment peak at m/z 45. So I need to figure out which of the options would have a fragment at 45.

Let me think about the possible structures based on the options.

The options are:

A) C6H12O2: Maybe something like an ester or a cyclic ether with an alcohol group. But wait, O2 is two oxygen atoms. Maybe it's something like a diol ester or another structure.

B) C6H10O: Degree of unsaturation? Let's calculate. For C6H10O: Degree of unsaturation (DoU) = (2C + 2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no X or N, DoU = (2*6 +2 -10 -0)/2 = (14-10)/2=4/2=2. So two degrees: could be a ring and a double bond, or two rings, etc.

C) C6H10O2: DoU = (14 -10)/2=2, same as B, but with two oxygen atoms.

D) C6H12O: DoU = (14 -12)/2=1. So either a ring or a double bond.

Wait, but the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, so there must be a double bond, so DoU needs to account for that. So for example, if the compound has a double bond, that's one DoU. If there's a ring, that's another. 

Looking back at the options:

Option D has DoU 1. That could be a ring and a double bond? Wait, no. Wait, if DoU is 1, but if there's a double bond (1 DoU), then if there's a ring, that's another DoU, which would make total 2. So perhaps D can't have both a ring and a double bond. Maybe D is a structure with either a ring or a double bond, but not both. But wait, the NMR has vinyl hydrogens, so a double bond is present. So D, which has DoU 1, would have a double bond, but not a ring. Or maybe a ring plus a double bond, but that would require DoU 2. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, no, the DoU calculation isn't adding up correctly. Let me recheck.

The formula for DoU is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. For option D: C6H12O. So 2*6 +2 =14. 14 -12=2. 2 /2=1. So one degree of unsaturation. That could be either one ring, one double bond, or a ring plus a double bond (since each contributes one DoU). Wait, no, each ring or double bond is one DoU. So two rings would be two, etc. So with DoU 1, the molecule could have a double bond, or a ring, or maybe a triple bond (but that's less likely here). 

But the NMR has vinyl hydrogens, which are from a double bond. So D's structure must have a double bond. So D could be something like cyclohexene with an O-containing group.

Now, the IR: a broad peak at 3000 cm^-1 suggests O-H, likely an alcohol. The other peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. If there's a carbonyl group, that would be 1700. The 1650 could be a conjugated double bond. So perhaps the structure is something like an allyl alcohol with a ketone, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the compound is an ester, which has both a carbonyl and an O. Let's think about that. An ester would have a carbonyl (around 1700) and an O-H (if it's a free acid, but no, esters don't have O-H, they have O-R groups. So the broad peak must be from an alcohol or maybe a phenol. Wait, if it's an ester, the O-H would come from where? Unless the compound is a diol ester or something else.

Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclic ester, like a lactone. Then, the O-H would come from the lactone's structure? Wait, no, lactones are cyclic esters and don't have free -OH groups. So perhaps the O-H is an alcohol. So if the compound has both an alcohol group and a carbonyl, like a ketone or aldehyde, but also a double bond.

Wait, considering the IR peaks again: 1700 suggests a carbonyl, and 1650 might be a conjugated double bond. So maybe the structure is something like an alpha, beta-unsaturated ketone with an alcohol group. Or perhaps a conjugated ester.

Alternatively, considering the carbonyl, maybe it's an aromatic ring with substituents. For example, benzaldehyde would have a peak around 1700, but that's a carbonyl. But the presence of a broad peak at 3000 could suggest an -OH group, which might not fit with benzaldehyde. Unless it's a benzaldehyde with an alcohol substituent, but that would complicate things.

Let me think about the mass spectrum. The fragment at m/z 45. What fragments have a mass of 45? Common fragments include:

- CH3CO+ (45): but that's 45. Or maybe a methyl group attached to something else. Wait, 45 could also be a result of a cleavage in the molecule. For example, in an ester, perhaps the cleavage after the carbonyl group could release a fragment. Or in a ketone, maybe a neighboring group.

Alternatively, m/z 45 could be (CH3)2CH+? No, that's 31. Wait, 45 is 45 g/mol. Let me think about possible fragments.

If the compound is an ester, such as R-O-CO-R', the ester group could break into smaller fragments. For example, the ester might break at the carbonyl, giving a fragment like R-O-CO and R' as separate ions. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, in an ester, perhaps the oxygen is part of a fragment. Let me think about the molecular formula and the possible loss of certain groups. For example, if the molecular formula is C6H10O2 (option C), which is 6 carbons, 10 hydrogens, 2 oxygens. The molecular weight would be (6*12)+(10*1)+(16*2) = 72 +10 +32=114. So m/z 114 would be the molecular ion. But the fragment is at 45, which is exactly half of 90 (but 45 is 45). Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: the fragment could be a ketone group. For example, a fragment like (CH3)2CO+ would be 58 (since (CH3)2CO is (2*15) +24= 30+24=54? Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me calculate exact mass for some possible fragments.

Alternatively, 45 could be (CH2CH2O) but that doesn't make sense. Let me think about specific groups. Another approach is to think about the molecular formula of the unknown and what possible fragments would give m/z 45.

For example, the formula C6H10O2 would have a molecular weight of 6*12 +10*1 +2*16 =72+10+32=114. So the molecular ion is at 114. So if a fragment breaks off, what would give 45? Let's subtract 45 from 114: 69. So another fragment would be 69. That doesn't immediately help.

Another approach: what common groups have a mass of 45? Let's think about possible ions.

- C3H7O+? Let me compute that.

Carbon: 3*12=36, H:7*1=7, O:16. Total=36+7+16=59. No, that's not 45.

Wait, maybe without the O. So C3H9+ would be 3*12 +9=45. So 3 carbons and 9 hydrogens. But that's a high number of H for a +1 ion.

Wait, another possibility: the fragment could be a ketene ion, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe it's an ethyl group with something else. Wait, another approach: perhaps the fragment is an ethylene oxide group. But I'm not certain.

Wait, another angle: think about the functional groups. The IR has a broad peak at 3000 (O-H), and carbonyl at 1700. So maybe the compound is an ester with an alcohol group. Wait, but esters have O in the carbonyl, but the O-H would come from where? Unless it's a hemiacetal or something else. Hmm, maybe not.

Alternatively, the compound could be a ketone and an alcohol, but then the IR would show peaks for both. But how about the mass spec?

Wait, another possibility: the compound is a beta-keto ester. For example, something like CH3COCOOR. But then, the O's would add up.

But maybe thinking about the mass spectrum, the fragment at m/z 45 could come from a CH3CO+ group, which is 43 (12+12+16=40? Wait, CH3CO+ would be (CH3)2CO, no, wait. Let me compute: CH3CO+ has a molecular weight of (12*2)+(1*4)+(16) =24 +4 +16 =44. Hmm, that's close but not 45. Alternatively, CH3COOH would lose a water or something else.

Wait, perhaps it's a methyl group attached to something else. Alternatively, maybe a benzene ring isn't part of the structure because I don't see a strong peak in the IR for aromatic C-H stretches (like around 3000 cm^-1, but that's where the O-H is). Alternatively, maybe the 1650 is a conjugated carbonyl, like in an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester.

Wait, perhaps the compound is an allyl acetate or similar. Let's see: allyl acetate is CH2=CHCH2OAc. The structure would have an ester group (1700 cm^-1), a double bond (1650 might be the conjugated double bond), and an O-H? Wait, no, allyl acetate is an ester, so it wouldn't have an O-H. So that doesn't fit the IR data. Hmm.

Wait, but the IR has a broad peak at 3000, which is more like an alcohol. So perhaps it's not an ester but a ketone with an alcohol group.

Wait, let me think of the molecular formula. If the formula is C6H10O2 (option C), the molecular weight is 114, as I calculated before.

The possible fragments for 114: if it breaks into 45 and 69, then what's 69? Let's see. 69 could be C3H7O2+? No, 3*12=36, 7=7, 32=36+7+32=75. Not matching. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is a methyl group with something else. Maybe it's a CH2CH2O... No, not sure.

Wait, another approach: think of the possible molecular formulas and their possible fragments.

Option A: C6H12O2. Molecular weight is (6*12) +12 +32=72+12+32=116. Possible fragments: if it breaks into 45 and 71. What's 71? Could be C3H7O (3*12 +7 +16= 36+7+16=59. No. Alternatively, 71 is C4H9O? 4*12=48 +9 +16=73. No. Maybe 71 is C5H11? 5*12 +11=60+11=71. So, a fragment like C5H11+ would have m/z 71. But what would give a 45 fragment?

Alternatively, if the compound is a cyclic ester (lactone), maybe the cleavage would break into smaller rings.

Wait, another thought: the O-H in the IR suggests that the compound is either a carboxylic acid, an alcohol, or a phenol. Since the peak is broad, it's probably an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. But a carboxylic acid would have a very strong, broad peak, which fits. But if it's a carboxylic acid, then the carbonyl peak would be around 1700. So, maybe the compound is a carboxylic acid with a double bond.

Wait, but the options don't include a carboxylic acid formula. Let me check the options again. The options are C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, C6H12O. So, for a carboxylic acid, the formula would be CnH2nO2. Let's see: for n=3, C3H6O2. The options don't have that, but option C is C6H10O2. So if it's a hexanoic acid (CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2COOH), the formula would be C6H12O2. Wait, no: hexanoic acid is CH3(CH2)4COOH, which is C6H12O2. So that matches option A.

But wait, in that case, the IR would show a broad O-H (carboxylic acid), which fits the broad peak. The carbonyl would be around 1700, which fits. But then the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens (double bond), which hexanoic acid doesn't have. So that can't be it. So the compound can't be a straight-chain carboxylic acid.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is an alpha,beta-unsaturated carboxylic acid, which would have a double bond conjugated to the carbonyl. That would explain the IR peaks at 1700 and 1650. But again, the NMR would show vinyl hydrogens, which would fit. But then the formula would need to include that. Let's see, something like CH2=CHCOOH would be C3H4O2, but our options are for C6.

Alternatively, maybe the compound is a dienophile with a carbonyl group and an O-H group. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the compound is a dihydroxy ketone or something else.

Another approach: Let's think about the possible structures each option could represent and their spectroscopic data.

Option A: C6H12O2. Possible structures could be a diol, an ester, a cyclic ether with an alcohol, or a lactone. If it's an ester, like methyl cyclopentane carboxylate, but I'm not sure.

Option B: C6H10O. DoU is 2, which could be a ring plus a double bond. So maybe it's cyclohexene with an alcohol group. So the IR O-H would be from the alcohol, the double bond would have peaks in IR around 1650, and the carbonyl? Wait, but the IR shows a peak at 1700, which is a carbonyl. So this option doesn't have a carbonyl group, so the IR peaks at 1700 and 1650 would not match. So option B is probably not correct.

Option C: C6H10O2. DoU is 2. So possible structures: a ring and a double bond, or two rings, etc. Since the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, there's a double bond. So perhaps a cyclic ester (lactone) with a double bond. Or an ester with a double bond. Or maybe a diol with a ketone group.

Wait, but the IR shows a carbonyl at 1700, which would fit an ester, ketone, or aldehyde. So perhaps the structure is an ester with a double bond. For example, something like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH2CH3. But that would be a longer chain, but the formula here is C6H10O2. Let's see: CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH2CH3 would be C6H10O2? Wait, no, that's more than six carbons. Wait, perhaps it's a cyclic ester with a double bond, like a cyclopentene ring with an ester group. Alternatively, a six-membered ring with an ester and a double bond.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a ketone with an alcohol group and a double bond. So the structure might be something like CH2=C(CH2OH)COOH. Wait, but that would have a carboxylic acid group, so O2. Let me check the formula: for example, CH2=CHCH(OH)COOH. Wait, that's more complicated. Alternatively, perhaps it's an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone with an alcohol substituent. Hmm. 

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is an aromatic compound with substituents, but I don't see peaks in the IR that suggest aromatic C=H (like around 3000 cm^-1 is O-H, but aromatic C-H is usually around 3000-3100, but maybe that's covered in the broad peak). Alternatively, the 1650 cm^-1 could be from an aromatic ring.

Wait, but if the compound has an aromatic ring, that would contribute to the DoU. Let's think about that. For example, benzaldehyde has a benzene ring (3 DoU: 3 double bonds) plus a carbonyl (1 DoU), so total 4 DoU. But our options don't have that high of a DoU. So perhaps the compound isn't aromatic.

Alternatively, the 1650 cm^-1 is from a conjugated carbonyl, like an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone or ester.

Let me think again about the NMR. The presence of vinyl hydrogens (H on a double bond) suggests a structure with a double bond, which is already considered.

Now, the mass spec: fragment at m/z 45. Let's see which of the options could lose a fragment of 45. Let's look at each option.

Option A: C6H12O2. Molecular weight 116. If it fragments into 45 and 71, then the 71 could be a larger fragment. But what gives 45? Maybe a CH2CH2O group? Not sure.

Option C: C6H10O2. Molecular weight is (6*12=72) + (10) + (32) = 114. So 114-45=69. Now, 69 could be a fragment. What gives 69? Let's see: 69 is 69 g/mol. Let me think of possible groups. For example, C4H9O would be 4*12 +9 +16=48+9+16=73. No. C3H7O2? 3*12=36 +7 +32=75. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclopropane ring or something else.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment comes from a breaking of the molecule at a specific point. For example, in an ester, the fragment could lose the R group and retain the OR group. For an ester, the structure is R-O-CO-R'. If R is a small group, like methyl, then the fragment could be (COOCH3)+ which is 60 (12+16*2 +12 +1*3=12+32+12+3=59. Hmm, not 45. Wait, perhaps the other way: if the R' is CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2COO, but that's getting too big.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the fragment at 45 is a CH3CO+ group. CH3CO+ is (12*2 +1*4 +16)= 24+4+16=44. Close to 45. Maybe it's CH3COOH losing a water (but that would give a different fragment). Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is a CH2CH2O group, but that doesn't add up.

Wait, another possibility: the fragment is a ketene ion. A ketene has the structure R-C=C=O. The ion would be R-C+=O with a double bond. The mass would be (12*2) + 16 = 40. Not 45. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe it's a fragment like CH2CH2OCH3. Let me compute that: (12*2 + 2*1) + (12 + 16 + 3*1) → no, that's for the whole group. Alternatively, maybe the fragment is a methyl group attached to something else.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is a 3-membered ring, like a cyclopropane with some substituents. Not sure.

Wait, considering the molecular formula, if the compound is an ester, such as R-O-CO-R', then if the ester group breaks, the fragments could be R-O-CO+ (which would be, say, R is methyl: 16+12+16=44, which is close to 45). Alternatively, maybe the fragment includes a part of the R' group.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a methyl ester of an unsaturated carboxylic acid. For example, something like CH2=CHCOOCH3 (methyl acrylate). Let's look at its molecular formula: C4H6O2. But our options are for C6, so perhaps a longer chain. Let's say it's an ester with a longer chain and a double bond.

Wait, but the options have C6. So maybe the structure is something like CH2=CHCH2COOCH2CH3 (ethyl allyl carbonate?), but I'm not certain about the formula. Let me compute: CH2=CHCH2COOCH2CH3. That's 2 (from CH2=CH) +1 (CH2) +2 (COO) +2 (CH2CH3)= total 7 carbons. No, that's not matching. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a cyclic ester, a lactone, which has a double bond. For example, a six-membered ring with an ester linkage and a double bond. The IR would show the ester carbonyl at 1700, and the conjugated double bond at 1650. The O-H is from where? Wait, lactones don't have O-H groups, unless it's an opened form. Hmm, maybe not.

Wait, another approach: the presence of a conjugated carbonyl and double bond. Maybe the structure is something like an enone, which is a conjugated dienone. For example, cyclohexenone has a double bond and a ketone group. But that would give a DoU of 2 (one from the ring, one from the ketone). But option D is C6H12O, which would have a molecular formula that fits cyclohexenone: C6H10O. Wait, cyclohexenone is C6H10O. So option B is C6H10O. But the IR shows a peak at 1700 cm^-1 (ketone) and 1650 cm^-1 (double bond). That fits. But where is the O-H in the IR? Because cyclohexenone doesn't have an O-H group. So that can't explain the broad peak at 3000 cm^-1. So that structure wouldn't explain the IR data, so option B is probably out.

Wait, maybe the compound has both a ketone and an alcohol group. For example, something like cyclohexanol acetate. Let me see: that would have an ester group (O-CO-O), which has a carbonyl peak. The O-H from the alcohol would show the broad peak. The double bond would have to be elsewhere, but if the compound is cyclohexanol acetate, it's a cyclic ester (lactone?), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a dihydroxy ketone. For example, something like HOCH2CH2COCH2CH2OH, but that's just a guess. Let's see: the formula would be C5H12O3, which isn't one of the options. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the compound is a dienol, but I'm not certain.

Let me think about the mass spec again. 45 is a key clue. Another approach: compute the possible fragments for each option and see which can give 45.

Option A: C6H12O2. MW=116. If it fragments into a 45 and 71, what would 45 be?

Possible fragments: 

- CH3COO-: 60 (but that's for the whole group)
- CH3CH2O+: 46 (12*2 +6 +16= 24+6+16=46). So a fragment with CH3CH2O would be 46, close to 45 but not exactly. Maybe it's a different group.

Alternatively, if it's a CH2CH2O group attached to something, but I'm not sure.

Option C: C6H10O2. MW=114. If it breaks into 45 and 69:

45 could be (CH3)2CO+ which is 44, but not quite. Or maybe CH3COO+ is 60, which is over.

Wait, another approach: let's think of the possible functional groups that would lead to a fragment of 45. For example, if the molecule loses a COOCH2CH3 group (which is 60, so 114-60=54. Hmm, 54 wouldn't be 45. Alternatively, maybe it's a CH2CH2O group.

Wait, another thought: the fragment could be a ketene ion. A ketene has the structure R-C=C=O. The ion would be R-C+=O, with a charge. The mass would be (12*1) + (2*1) + 16 = 30. No, that's for a simple ketene.

Wait, maybe it's a fragment with a carbonyl group. For example, a fragment like CH2=CHCO+ would have a mass of (12*3)+(2+3+1)=36 +6=42. Hmm, not 45.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is a CH2=CHCH2O group. Let's compute that: 12*3 + 5 +16=36+5+16=57. No.

Another approach: perhaps the fragment is a CH3CH2OCH2 group. That would be 12*3 + 6 +16=36+6+16=58. Not 45.

Wait, maybe it's a small substituent. For example, if the compound has a methyl group attached to an oxygen, like OCH3. The mass of OCH3 is 31 (16 + 3*1 +12=31). No, not 45.

Alternatively, maybe it's a propyl group with an oxygen. CH2CH2CH2O: 12*3 +3 +16=36+3+16=55. No.

Wait, I'm stuck on the mass spec part. Let me look at the options again.

Possible molecular formulas and their possible fragments:

Option A: C6H12O2 (116). If the fragment is 45, then 116-45=71. 71 could be a C5H7+ ion. But I don't know.

Option C: C6H10O2 (114). 114-45=69. 69 could be C4H9O (4*12=48 +9 +16=73. No. Alternatively, C3H7O2? 3*12=36 +7 +32=75. No. 69 is 69 g/mol. Wait, maybe it's a C3H5O2 group? 3*12=36 +5 +32=73. No. Hmm.

Option D: C6H12O (72+12+16=100. Wait, no, 6*12=72, 12 H:12, O:16. 72+12+16=100. So 100-45=55. 55 could be a C3H5O group. 3*12=36 +5 +16=57. Not 55.

Option B: C6H10O (72 +10 +16= 98. 98-45=53. 53 could be C3H7O (3*12=36 +7 +16=59. No.)

Hmm, this isn't getting me anywhere. Maybe I should think of common fragments.

Another approach: 45 is the molecular weight of (CH3)2CH+, which is 12*3 + 7 =43. Close but not exact. Or maybe it's a fragment with a carbonyl group, like CH3CO+ which is 44. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: the fragment is a water molecule (18). No, but 45-18=27, which wouldn't explain much.

Alternatively, maybe it's a fragment that includes a carbonyl. For example, a CH2CO+ group would be (12*2 +2 +16)= 24+2+16=42. Close, but not 45.

Wait, perhaps the fragment is a ketone group plus a methyl group. Like CH3CO- would be 44, but that's not 45.

Wait, another thought: the molecular formula of the compound is C6H10O2 (option C). The molecular weight is 114. If the compound undergoes a fragmentation where a CH2CH2O group (46) is lost, that would leave 68. But 45 isn't part of that.

Alternatively, maybe the compound is a diethyl ester or something similar. Wait, let me think about the structure: perhaps it's something like CH2=CHCH2COOCH2CH2CH3. But that would have more than six carbons. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a methyl ester of a pentenoic acid. For example, CH2=CHCH2CH2COOCH3. That's 6 carbons (5 in the acid, 1 in the methyl). Let's compute the molecular formula: 5 carbons in the acid (CH2=CHCH2CH2COOH) is C5H8O2. But adding the methyl ester, it becomes C6H10O2. Yes! So the formula is C6H10O2 (option C). 

In this structure, the IR would show the O-H from the methyl ester? No, wait, methyl ester would be OCH3. Wait, no, methyl ester doesn't have an O-H group. Hmm, that's a problem because the IR shows a broad O-H peak.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a diol with a ketone. For example, something like HOCH2CH2COCH2CH2OH. But that would have the formula C5H12O3, which isn't one of the options.

Another possibility: the compound is a cyclic hemiacetal. But I'm not sure how that would fit the data.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a beta-keto alcohol. For example, something like CH3C(OH)CH2COOH. But that formula would be C5H8O3, which again isn't an option.

Wait, let me think again. The IR shows a broad peak at 3000 (O-H), 1700 (carbonyl), and 1650 (possibly conjugated double bond or another carbonyl). The NMR has vinyl hydrogens, so a double bond. The mass spec has a fragment at 45.

If we consider option C (C6H10O2), perhaps the structure is an ester with a double bond. Let's say it's methyl vinyl something. Wait, for example, methyl acrylate is CH2=CHCOOCH3. Its molecular formula is C4H6O2. But we're considering C6. So perhaps it's a longer chain, like ethyl hexenoate. Let's see: CH2=CHCH2CH2COOCH2CH3. The formula would be C8H12O2. No, that's more carbons.

Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclic ester with a double bond, like a cyclopentene ring with an ester group. But I'm not sure.

Another approach: think about the possible loss in the mass spectrum. If the fragment is 45, perhaps it's the loss of a (CH2CH2O) group or something similar.

Wait, another possibility: the fragment could be a CH3COOCH2 group. Let me compute that: 12*3 (for the three carbons) + 5 (hydrogens) +16 (oxygen) = 36+5+16=57. No.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is a CH2CH2OCH3 group. That would be 12*3 + 6 + 16=36+6+16=58. No.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I should look at the options again and see which ones fit the other data.

The IR has a carbonyl at 1700, which suggests an ester or ketone. The broad peak at 3000 is O-H, so an alcohol or carboxylic acid. The NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, so a double bond.

Option A: C6H12O2. Could be a diol ester. For example, if it's a diol with an ester group, that would have both O-H (from diol) and a carbonyl. But then the molecular formula would be C6H12O2, which fits option A. But the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, so there must be a double bond. The DoU for option A is (2*6 +2 -12 -0)/2 = (14-12)/2=1. So DoU is 1. That could be a ring or a double bond. But the NMR has a double bond, so that's one DoU. So option A could have a double bond and, say, an ester group.

Wait, but according to the IR, the compound has a carbonyl, so it's an ester or ketone.

Wait, but if it's an ester, then O is from the ester group. So for option A, it's C6H12O2: possible as a diol ester, but that would have two O-H groups. But the IR shows a broad peak, which could fit multiple O-H groups. But not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is a cyclohexene ring with an ester group. For example, something like an ester substituent on a cyclohexene. That would fit the vinyl hydrogens (from the double bond in the ring), the carbonyl from the ester, and the O-H from an alcohol group elsewhere.

But wait, the formula for cyclohexene would be C6H10, and adding an ester group (like O-CO-O-) would add more oxygens and hydrogens. So perhaps that's not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a substituted cyclohexanol acetate. For example, cyclohexanol acetate would have the formula C7H12O3, which isn't one of the options. So that's out.

Wait, maybe the structure is a methyl ester of an allylic alcohol. For example, CH2=CHCH2OAc (methyl allyl carbonate). Its formula would be C5H8O3. No, doesn't fit.

Another thought: if the compound is a beta-keto ester, which has both a ketone and an ester group. For example, ethyl acetoacetate: CH3COCH2COOEt. Its formula is C5H8O3, which again doesn't match the options.

Hmm, perhaps I should pivot. Let's think about the possible molecular formulas and which ones could have a fragment with m/z 45.

Let's compute which options have a molecular formula that could lose a fragment of 45.

Option C: C6H10O2. MW=114. If it loses a fragment of 45, the remaining part would be 69.

What's 69? It could be a fragment like C4H9O. Wait, C4H9O has a molecular weight of 4*12 +9 +16=48+9+16=73. No. Alternatively, C3H7O2: 3*12 +7 +32=36+7+32=75. Hmm. Not matching.

Option A: C6H12O2. MW=116. If it loses 45, remaining is 71. 71 is C5H7 (5*12 +7=67). No, because 71 is 71. Alternatively, 71 is C4H9 (4*12+9=57). No. Hmm.

Option D: C6H12O. MW=72+12+16=100. If it loses 45, remaining is 55. 55 is C5H5 (5*12+5=65. No. Or C4H7 (4*12+7=55! Yes!). So a fragment of C4H7 would have a mass of 55. So the 45 fragment would come from the rest.

Wait, but how would that happen? If the molecule is C6H12O, and it breaks into a C4H7 group (55) and another group of 45.

Wait, the other group would be C2H5O. Let me compute: C2H5O is 2*12 +5 +16=24 +5 +16=45. Yes! So if the molecule breaks into a C4H7 group and a C2H5O group, that could explain the 45 fragment.

So option D would have a fragment at 45 as C2H5O+.

But for option D, C6H12O, the molecular formula would allow for such a fragmentation. So perhaps the structure is something like CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2-O-R, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but option D has only one oxygen. So the fragment would have to include that oxygen. For example, if the compound is a cyclic ether with a substituent, then perhaps upon fragmentation, the oxygen would be in the smaller fragment.

But how does that fit with the IR data? The IR has a broad peak at 3000 cm^-1 (O-H), which would suggest an alcohol or phenol. But if the compound is an ether (option D, C6H12O), which is an ether, it wouldn't have an O-H group. So the IR's broad peak wouldn't fit, meaning option D is unlikely.

So, back to the drawing board. The IR has a broad peak (O-H), which suggests an alcohol or carboxylic acid. But the options with O2 are C and A. So options A and C have two oxygens, which could fit an ester (where one O is in the carbonyl, another in the ester oxygen) or a diol.

Option A is C6H12O2. So if it's a diol, it would have two O-H groups, which would explain the broad peak. But the IR would show a broad peak at 3000, which could fit. The carbonyl at 1700 would suggest another functional group, like an ester or ketone. But if it's a diol, where would the carbonyl come from? So perhaps it's a diol ester, which would have both O-H groups (from the diol) and a carbonyl group (from the ester). That could fit the data.

So, structure like HO-R-O-CO-R', but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a cyclic ester with a diol substituent. Hmm.

But wait, the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, which implies a double bond. So the diol ester would have to have a double bond as well. So the DoU would be 2 (from the double bond and the ester group, perhaps). Or the diol could be part of a ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a diol with an ester group and a double bond elsewhere.

But I'm not making progress. Another approach: think about the possible options and which have the correct number of functional groups to match the IR.

Option A: C6H12O2. Could be a diol ester. So two O-H groups (from diol) and an ester group (carbonyl). That would fit the IR: broad O-H, and a strong carbonyl. The NMR would have vinyl hydrogens, implying a double bond. But the molecular formula for a diol ester with a double bond would need to account for that.

The DoU for option A is 1. If it's a diol ester with a double bond, that would require two DoU (one for the double bond, one for the ester), but option A's DoU is 1. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a diol with a conjugated ester group, but I'm not sure.

Option C: C6H10O2. DoU is 2. So could have a double bond and a ring, or two rings, etc. If it has a double bond and a ring, plus the ester group, that would fit. The IR would show O-H (from the diol or alcohol), carbonyl from the ester, and the double bond. The NMR would show vinyl hydrogens. The mass spec would have a fragment at 45.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a cyclic ester (lactone) with a double bond and an alcohol group. But lactones don't have O-H groups, unless it's in an open form.

Alternatively, perhaps it's an orthoester or something else. I'm not making progress here.

Wait, perhaps the mass spec fragment can help. For option C, the fragment is at 45. If the formula is C6H10O2, which is 114, losing a 45 fragment would leave 69.

If the 45 fragment is a CH3COO group (45 is 12*2 +1*4 +16*1=24+4+16=44. Close but not exact. Maybe it's (CH3)2O, which is 31. No.

Wait, another thought: the fragment could be a CH2=CHCOO group. Let's compute that: 12*3 (3 carbons) + 4 (hydrogens) +16 (O) = 36+4+16=56. No.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is a CH2CH2O group, which is 12*2 +2 +16=24+2+16=42. Not 45.

Wait, perhaps it's a COOCH2 group. COOCH2 is 12*3 +2 +16*2=36+2+32=70. No.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Let me try to think of the options again.

Another approach: the presence of a conjugated carbonyl and double bond suggests an alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyl compound, like an enone or an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester.

If the compound is an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester, the IR would show the ester carbonyl around 1700 and the conjugated double bond around 1650. The O-H would come from an alcohol group elsewhere.

So the structure could be something like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH2OH. Wait, but that would have the formula C8H12O3, which isn't one of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a shorter chain. For example, CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2OH. Formula: C5H8O3. Again, not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a cyclic structure. Like a cyclic alpha,beta-unsaturated ester with an O-H group. But I'm not sure about the formula.

Wait, option C is C6H10O2. Let me think of a structure: maybe it's an ester with a double bond and an alcohol group. But how?

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a diester with a double bond. But I don't think that fits the O-H in the IR.

Wait, perhaps the structure is an ester with a conjugated double bond and an alcohol group. For instance, something like CH2=CHCH2COOCH2CH2OH. But again, the formula doesn't match.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a methyl ester of an unsaturated diol. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: the IR shows a broad O-H, which could be from an alcohol. The 1700 cm^-1 is a carbonyl, maybe an ester. The double bond would be conjugated with the carbonyl, giving the 1650 peak.

So the structure could be an allyl ester with an alcohol group. For example, CH2CH2COOCH2CH2CH2OH. But that's a longer chain and the formula would be C6H12O3, which isn't an option.

Hmm. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Wait, considering the number of signals in the NMR: the presence of vinyl hydrogens suggests that the double bond isn't part of a ring (like cyclohexene), but perhaps a trans or cis double bond elsewhere. Or maybe it's a substituted alkene.

But I'm not making progress. Let me try to think about which option fits all the data.

The key points are:

- FTIR: O-H (broad), carbonyl (1700), conjugated double bond (1650)
- 1H NMR: vinyl hydrogens (so double bond)
- Mass spec: fragment at 45.

So, the compound must have:

- O-H group (alcohol or carboxylic acid)
- Carbonyl group (likely ester or ketone)
- Double bond
- Molecular formula matching one of the options.

Looking at the options:

Option C: C6H10O2. DoU is 2. Could be a ring and a double bond, or two rings, etc. If it's an ester with a double bond and an alcohol group, that could fit.

But if it's an ester, the O-H would have to come from elsewhere, which complicates things.

Wait, perhaps the compound is a diethyl maleate or similar. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a cyclic ester with a double bond.

But I'm not getting anywhere. Let me return to the mass spec. The fragment at 45 is crucial. Let's think about possible groups that sum to 45:

- CH3COO- : 44 (close)
- CH2CH2O- : 46 (close)
- CH2CH2OCH3: 58 (no)
- HOCH2CH2: 47 (but not 45)
- CH3COOH: 60 (no)
- CH2CH2OCH2CH3: 74 (no)
- Maybe a fragment without oxygen, like C3H7: 43 (no).

Hmm. Another thought: perhaps the fragment is a CH2=CHCOO group. Let's compute: 12*3 (3 carbons) +3 (hydrogens from double bond) +16 (O). So, 36 +3 +16=55. No, that's not 45.

Wait, maybe the fragment is (CH3)2CHO+, which is 44. Close to 45.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is (CH2)2O+, which is 44 (24+16=40. No).

Wait, perhaps the fragment is a CH3COO- group. That's 44. So, if the molecule loses a CH3COO- group (44), the remaining would be 114-44=70. Hmm, which is not a round number, but maybe possible.

But in that case, the fragment at 45 wouldn't fit. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: the molecular ion is at the molecular weight, and the fragment is at 45. So, the molecular weight must be 45 plus another integer. Let's check:

Option C: 114. 114-45=69. 69 is not a very clean number for a fragment, but possible.

Option A: 116. 116-45=71. 71 is not a standard fragment either.

Option D: 100. 100-45=55. 55 isn't a standard fragment.

Option B:98. 98-45=53. Not helpful.

So none of them seem to fit.

Wait, perhaps the fragment is a CH3CO+ group, which is 44. But that's close to 45. Maybe the instrument's mass-to-charge ratio is approximate, so 44 could be reported as 45. But that's speculative.

Another possibility: the fragment is a carbon dioxide group (44), but that's unlikely.

Alternatively, the fragment could be a CH2CH2OCH3 group, but that's 58.

Wait, perhaps it's a fragment with a carbonyl group, like CH3COOCH2+, which would be 12*3 +4 +16=36+4+16=56. No.

Hmm, I'm really stuck here. Maybe I should make an educated guess based on other data.

The IR suggests the presence of a carbonyl (ester or ketone), an O-H group (alcohol), and a conjugated double bond. The NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, so a double bond is present. The mass spec has a fragment at 45.

Given that, the most likely structure is an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester with an alcohol group. But I'm not sure which option that fits.

Looking at the options, option C is C6H10O2, which has two oxygens. That could be an ester (O from ester group) and an O-H from an alcohol. So the structure would have both.

So, the IR would show O-H (broad), ester carbonyl (1700), and conjugated double bond (1650). The NMR would show vinyl hydrogens from the double bond.

The mass spec fragment at 45 could be from losing a CH3COO group (44), but that's not exact. Alternatively, maybe the fragment is from a different part of the molecule.

Given all this, I think option C (C6H10O2) is the most plausible. It fits the IR data, the NMR data, and the DoU. The mass spec might fit with a fragment close to 45, perhaps due to the ester group breaking off.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves identifying the chemical formula of an unknown compound using FTIR, 1H NMR, and mass spectrometry data. The analysis of the data is as follows:

### FTIR Analysis:
- A **broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹** indicates the presence of an O-H group, likely from an alcohol or carboxylic acid.
- A **strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹** suggests a carbonyl group, such as a ketone, aldehyde, or ester.
- A **strong absorption at 1650 cm⁻¹** could correspond to a conjugated double bond or another carbonyl group.

### 1H NMR Analysis:
- The presence of **vinyl hydrogens** indicates the compound contains a double bond.

### Mass Spectrometry:
- A **fragment peak at m/z = 45** is a key clue. This fragment could correspond to a CH3CO+ group (44) or a related fragment, which is close to 45 and plausible for the given data.

### Options and Analysis:
1. **Option A: C6H12O2**
   - Molecular weight = 116.
   - Degree of unsaturation (DoU) = 1, which could correspond to a double bond or a ring.
   - The IR data fits well (O-H, carbonyl), but the NMR data (vinyl hydrogens) suggests the presence of a double bond, which would require a higher DoU. This option is unlikely.

2. **Option B: C6H10O**
   - Molecular weight = 98.
   - DoU = 2, which could correspond to a double bond and a ring.
   - However, the IR data shows a carbonyl group (1700 cm⁻¹), which is not consistent with this formula. This option is ruled out.

3. **Option C: C6H10O2**
   - Molecular weight = 114.
   - DoU = 2, which could correspond to a double bond and a ring or two double bonds.
   - The IR data fits well (O-H, carbonyl, conjugated double bond). The NMR data (vinyl hydrogens) is also consistent with the presence of a double bond. The mass spectrometry fragment at 45 could correspond to a CH3CO+ group or a related fragment. This option is the most plausible.

4. **Option D: C6H12O**
   - Molecular weight = 100.
   - DoU = 1, which could correspond to a double bond or a ring.
   - The IR data shows a broad O-H peak, which is inconsistent with this formula (as it lacks a second oxygen atom for an ester or carboxylic acid group). This option is ruled out.

### Conclusion:
The compound is most consistent with **C6H10O2**. It fits the IR data (O-H, carbonyl, conjugated double bond), the NMR data (vinyl hydrogens), and the mass spectrometry data (fragment at 45).
