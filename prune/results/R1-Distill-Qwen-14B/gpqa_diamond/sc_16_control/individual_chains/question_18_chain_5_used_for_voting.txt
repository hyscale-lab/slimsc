Okay, so I've got this problem here about stars and their elemental abundances. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step. Alright, let's see.

The question gives me information about two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Each has a mass, 1.5 and 1.2 times the Sun's mass, but I'm not sure if the mass matters here. The problem is about the elemental abundances, so maybe the mass isn't directly relevant. Let me focus on the abundance ratios.

They provided some [X/Y] values. I remember that the brackets notation in astronomy stands for the logarithm of the ratio of the element X to Y compared to the Sun. So, [X/Y] = log10(n_X / n_Y) - log10(n_X/n_Y)_sun. So it's the logarithmic difference.

For Star_1: [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex. That means the ratio of silicon to iron in Star_1 is higher than in the Sun by a factor of 10^0.3. Let me calculate that. 10^0.3 is approximately 2, because 10^0.3 is about 2, since 10^0.3010 is 2. So Star_1 has twice as much Si relative to Fe as the Sun does.

Also, for Star_1, [Fe/H]_1 is 0 dex. [Fe/H] is the metallicity, so this means the iron abundance relative to hydrogen is the same as the Sun. So Star_1's Fe/H is solar. Therefore, the abundance of Fe is the same as in the Sun.

Wait, but [Fe/H] is the logarithmic ratio of Fe to H, right? So [Fe/H] = log10(n_Fe/n_H) - log10(n_Fe/n_H)_sun. Since it's 0, that means n_Fe/n_H is the same as the Sun's. So Star_1 has the same Fe abundance as the Sun.

Now, given that [Si/Fe]_1 is 0.3, I can find [Si/H]_1. Since [Si/Fe] = [Si/H] - [Fe/H], right? Because [X/Y] = [X/H] - [Y/H]. So for Star_1, [Si/Fe]_1 = [Si/H]_1 - [Fe/H]_1. We know [Fe/H] is 0, so [Si/Fe]_1 = [Si/H]_1. Therefore, [Si/H]_1 is 0.3.

So, the Sun's [Si/H] is given? Wait, the problem says the Sun's photospheric composition is 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5. Wait, wait, I think the way it's written is 12 + log10(n_X/nH) equals a certain value for X being Fe and Mg.

Wait, so for the Sun, 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5. That means log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5. Because 12 + something equals 7.5, so that something is -4.5. So nFe/nH is 10^(-4.5). Similarly, for Mg, 12 + log10(nMg/nH) =7, so log10(nMg/nH) = -5. So nMg/nH is 10^(-5).

Wait, but normally, in the Sun, the abundance of Fe is about 7.5 in terms of logarithmic scale. Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me clarify.

The formula given is 12 + log10(n_X/nH) equals some number. So for Fe, it's 7.5. So log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5. So nFe/nH is 10^(-4.5) ≈ 3.16e-5.

Similarly, for Mg, 12 + log10(nMg/nH) =7 → log10(nMg/nH) =-5 → nMg/nH = 1e-5.

So for the Sun, the number of Fe per H is 3.16e-5, and Mg is 1e-5.

But how does that help me?

For Star_1, [Fe/H] is 0, so nFe/nH is the same as Sun's, which is 3.16e-5.

For Star_1, [Si/Fe] is 0.3. So [Si/Fe] = 0.3 → log10(nSi/nFe) - log10(nSi/nFe)_sun =0.3.

Wait, [X/Y] is defined as log(nX/nY) - log(nX/nY)_sun. So [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → log(nSi/nFe)_1 - log(nSi/nFe)_sun = 0.3.

I can compute log(nSi/nFe)_sun from the Sun's nFe/nH and the Sun's [Si/Fe], but wait, do I know [Si/Fe]_sun? Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute [Si/Fe]_sun as [Si/H]_sun - [Fe/H]_sun. Since [Fe/H]_sun is [Fe/H] for the Sun, which is zero by definition because [X/H] is measured relative to the Sun.

Wait, no. Wait, [X/H]_sun is zero because [X/H] is log(n_X/n_H) - log(n_X/n_H)_sun, so it's zero. So for the Sun, [Si/Fe]_sun is log(nSi/nFe)_sun.

Which is log(nSi/nH)_sun - log(nFe/nH)_sun → [Si/H]_sun - [Fe/H]_sun. Since [Fe/H]_sun is zero, [Si/Fe]_sun = [Si/H]_sun.

Wait, this is getting a bit tangled. Let me think again.

For the Sun, [Fe/H] is zero. So for Star_1, [Fe/H] is zero as well. So nFe/nH = Sun's nFe/nH.

Sun's nFe/nH: 3.16e-5 as calculated.

Now, Star_1's [Si/Fe] is 0.3. So the ratio of Si to Fe in Star_1 is 10^0.3 times higher than in the Sun.

So, [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → log(nSi/nFe)_1 = log(nSi/nFe)_sun + 0.3.

But I need to get the actual nSi/nH ratio in Star_1.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express nSi in terms of nFe.

nSi = nFe * (10^{0.3} * (nSi/nFe)_sun )

Because nSi/nFe = 10^{0.3} * (nSi/nFe)_sun.

So, nSi/nFe = (nSi/nFe)_sun * 10^{0.3}.

But nSi/nFe)_sun is [Si/Fe]_sun. Wait, [Si/Fe]_sun is [Si/Fe] of the Sun, which is the same as [Si/Fe]_sun = log(nSi/nFe)_sun - log(nSi/nFe)_sun =0? No, that can't be right.

Wait, for the Sun, [X/Y] is log(nX/nY) - log(nX/nY)_sun, which is zero. So [X/Y] for the Sun is zero.

So for the Sun, [Si/Fe]_sun is log(nSi/nFe)_sun - log(nSi/nFe)_sun =0. So, [Si/Fe]_sun =0.

So, [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → log(nSi/nFe)_1 = log(nSi/nFe)_sun + 0.3 → but log(nSi/nFe)_sun is 0, so log(nSi/nFe)_1 = 0.3 → nSi/nFe = 10^0.3 ≈ 2.

So, in Star_1, nSi = 2 * nFe.

But nFe in Star_1 is the same as Sun's, because [Fe/H]_1 is 0. So, nFe = nFe_sun =3.16e-5.

So nSi = 2 * 3.16e-5 ≈6.32e-5.

Then, nSi/nH in Star_1 is equal to nSi/nFe * nFe/nH → (6.32e-5) / nH? Wait, no, nSi = nSi = (nFe) * (nSi/nFe).

Wait, nFe is 3.16e-5, so nSi = (3.16e-5) * 2 =6.32e-5.

nH in Star_1 is the same as nH in the Sun, because [Fe/H]_1 is zero, which implies nFe/nH is the same. So nH is nH_sun = nFe_sun / (3.16e-5) → but wait, nFe/nH_sun is 3.16e-5. So nH_sun is nFe_sun / (3.16e-5).

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute all the ratios in terms of the Sun.

So for the Sun, nFe/nH =3.16e-5 → nH_sun = nFe_sun / (3.16e-5).

Similarly, nSi_sun is (nSi/nH)_sun * nH_sun.

Wait, but wait: let me think again.

The Sun's [Si/H] is given by 12 + log(nSi/nH) = something. Wait, the problem doesn't directly provide that for Si. Only for Fe and Mg.

Wait, the problem says for the Sun: 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5, so  log10(nFe/nH)=7.5-12= -4.5 → nFe/nH=10^(-4.5) ≈3.16e-5.

Similarly, for Mg, 12 + log10(nMg/nH) =7 → log10(nMg/nH)= -5 → nMg/nH=1e-5.

But for Si, the problem doesn't give a direct value, unless I compute it using the Sun's [Si/Fe] and [Fe/H].

Wait, for the Sun, [Fe/H]=0, which is given. And for the Sun, [Si/Fe]_sun =0 as well, because [X/Y] is zero for the Sun.

So, [Si/Fe]_sun = log(nSi/nFe)_sun - log(nSi/nFe)_sun =0. So, nSi/nFe =1 in the Sun.

So, nSi = nFe in the Sun.

So, nSi/nH = (nSi/nFe) * (nFe/nH) = 1 * 3.16e-5 =3.16e-5.

So, the Sun's nSi/nH is 3.16e-5.

Back to Star_1: [Si/Fe]_1=0.3, so nSi/nFe =10^0.3 ≈2.

Since nFe in Star_1 is the same as Sun's (because [Fe/H]_1=0), nFe=3.16e-5.

So, nSi = 2 *3.16e-5 =6.32e-5.

nH in Star_1 is same as Sun's because [Fe/H] is 0. So, nH = nH_sun.

Therefore, nSi/nH in Star_1 is 6.32e-5 / nH_sun.

Wait, but I can calculate nH_sun from the Sun's data. For the Sun, nFe/nH =3.16e-5 → nH_sun = nFe_sun /3.16e-5.

But that's okay because when I take the ratio between Star_1 and Star_2, the nH_sun might cancel out.

Alternatively, consider that in both stars, the [Fe/H] is 0, so their nFe/nH is same as Sun. So their H abundance is same as Sun's as well.

Wait, wait. Let me think: the number of hydrogen atoms would be same in the same proportional sense as the Sun. Because if nFe/nH is the same as the Sun, then nH is nFe/(nFe/nH)_sun. So for Star_1, nH = (nFe_star1) / (nFe/nH)_sun.

But nFe_star1 is equal to (nFe/nH)_sun * nH_star1. Since [Fe/H]_1 is zero, nFe/nH is same as Sun.

So, perhaps the ratio of nSi in Star_1 and Star_2 can be found without concerning about the absolute values of H, because we can express it relative to H.

But maybe I'm getting too tangled here. Let me approach this differently.

Problem asks for the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So, (nSi_1 / nSi_2).

We need to compute [Si/H]_1 and [Si/H]_2, then find the ratio.

Wait, but wait, [X/Y] is log(nX/nY) - log(nX/nY)_sun.

So, [Si/H]_1 = log(nSi_1/nH_1) - log(nSi_sun/nH_sun).

Similarly for Star_2.

But since for both stars, [Fe/H] is zero, that implies that nFe/nH is same as Sun, so nH in both is same as Sun's. So nH_1 = nH_sun, same as nH_2.

Therefore, [Si/H]_1 = log(nSi_1 / nH_sun) - log(nSi_sun / nH_sun) = log(nSi_1 / nSi_sun).

Because nH_sun cancels out.

Similarly, [Si/H]_2 = log(nSi_2 / nSi_sun).

So, the value of [Si/H]_1 is 0.3, as we found earlier.

Wait, no. Wait, for Star_1, [Si/Fe] is 0.3, and [Fe/H] is 0. So [Si/H]_1 = [Si/Fe]_1 + [Fe/H]_1 → 0.3 + 0 =0.3.

So [Si/H]_1 =0.3 → log(nSi_1/nH_sun ) = log(nSi_sun /nH_sun) +0.3 → nSi_1/nSi_sun =10^0.3 → nSi_1 =nSi_sun * 10^0.3.

Similarly for Star_2, let's compute [Si/H]_2.

Wait, Star_2 has [Mg/Si]_2 =0.3. And [Mg/H]_2=0.

So, [Mg/Si]_2 = [Mg/H]_2 - [Si/H]_2 → 0.3 = 0 - [Si/H]_2 → [Si/H]_2 = -0.3.

So, [Si/H]_2 is -0.3 → log(nSi_2/nH_sun) = log(nSi_sun /nH_sun) -0.3 → nSi_2 = nSi_sun *10^(-0.3) ≈ nSi_sun * 0.5.

So, the ratio nSi_1 / nSi_2 = [nSi_sun *10^0.3 ] / [nSi_sun *10^-0.3 ] = (10^0.3 )/(10^-0.3 ) =10^(0.6) ≈ 3.98.

So, approximately 4.

Looking at the options, option A is ~3.9, which is close.

Wait, but let me double-check the steps.

For Star_1:

[Si/Fe]_1 =0.3 → [Si/Fe] = [Si/H] - [Fe/H] → 0.3 = [Si/H]_1 - 0 → [Si/H]_1=0.3.

So, [Si/H]_1 =0.3 → log(nSi_1/nH_sun) = log(nSi_sun /nH_sun ) +0.3.

Which means, nSi_1 = nSi_sun *10^0.3.

For Star_2:

[Mg/Si]_2=0.3 → [Mg/Si] = [Mg/H] - [Si/H] → 0.3 = [Mg/H]_2 - [Si/H]_2.

[Mg/H]_2 is 0 → 0.3 = 0 - [Si/H]_2 → [Si/H]_2= -0.3.

So, [Si/H]_2 =-0.3 → log(nSi_2/nH_sun ) = log(nSi_sun /nH_sun) -0.3 → nSi_2 =nSi_sun *10^(-0.3).

So, the ratio is (nSi_1)/(nSi_2) = (10^0.3 )/(10^-0.3 ) → 10^(0.6) ≈3.98.

So, approximately 3.98, which is about 4. So the correct option is A) ~3.9.

To determine the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2, we analyze the given elemental abundance data and use the logarithmic abundance ratios provided in the question.

### Key Information:
1. **Star_1**:
   - [Si/Fe]₁ = 0.3 dex: The ratio of silicon to iron in Star_1 is 10⁰.³ ≈ 2 times higher than in the Sun.
   - [Fe/H]₁ = 0 dex: The iron abundance relative to hydrogen is the same as in the Sun, meaning nFe/nH in Star_1 is the same as in the Sun.

2. **Star_2**:
   - [Mg/Si]₂ = 0.3 dex: The ratio of magnesium to silicon in Star_2 is 10⁰.³ ≈ 2 times higher than in the Sun.
   - [Mg/H]₂ = 0 dex: The magnesium abundance relative to hydrogen is the same as in the Sun.

3. **Sun's Composition**:
   - 12 + log₁₀(nFe/nH) = 7.5 → log₁₀(nFe/nH) = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10⁻⁴.⁵ ≈ 3.16 × 10⁻⁵.
   - 12 + log₁₀(nMg/nH) = 7 → log₁₀(nMg/nH) = -5 → nMg/nH = 10⁻⁵.

### Analysis:
#### For Star_1:
- Since [Fe/H]₁ = 0, nFe/nH in Star_1 is the same as in the Sun: nFe/nH = 3.16 × 10⁻⁵.
- [Si/Fe]₁ = 0.3 implies nSi/nFe in Star_1 is 10⁰.³ ≈ 2 times higher than in the Sun.
- Therefore, nSi in Star_1 is nSi = 2 × nFe = 2 × (3.16 × 10⁻⁵) = 6.32 × 10⁻⁵.

#### For Star_2:
- [Mg/Si]₂ = 0.3 implies nMg/nSi in Star_2 is 10⁰.³ ≈ 2 times higher than in the Sun.
- Since [Mg/H]₂ = 0, nMg/nH in Star_2 is the same as in the Sun: nMg/nH = 10⁻⁵.
- From nMg/nSi = 2, we find nSi = nMg / 2 = (10⁻⁵) / 2 = 5 × 10⁻⁶.

#### Ratio of Silicon Atoms:
- The ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 to Star_2 is:
  \[
  \frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}}{n_{\text{Si,2}}} = \frac{6.32 \times 10^{-5}}{5 \times 10^{-6}} = 12.64.
  \]
  However, this result seems inconsistent with the earlier steps. Reassessing, the correct ratio is:
  \[
  \frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}}{n_{\text{Si,2}}} = \frac{10^{0.3}}{10^{-0.3}} = 10^{0.6} \approx 3.98.
  \]

### Final Answer:
The ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2 is approximately **3.9**.
