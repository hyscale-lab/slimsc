Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by breaking down the information given.

First, the problem describes a series of reactions. I'll list what I understand:

1. Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form product C, which is bright red. So that's A + 8B → C.

2. Then, C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce product E, which is extremely hazardous. So, C + 2D → E.

3. Next, C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids, F and G. F is strong, G is weak. So, C + H2O → A + F + G.

4. Also, D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent. So, D + B → H.

The question is asking about the molecular symmetry group of E. The options are symmetry groups like C2, D4h, D∞h, and C2v.

Hmm. I think I need to figure out what's happening in each reaction to identify the compounds involved, especially E. Once I know E's structure, I can determine its molecular symmetry.

Let me start by thinking about reaction 3: C reacts with water to produce A, F, and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. Strong acids are like H2SO4, HCl, etc. Weak acids are like CH3COOH or HNO2.

Wait, but when a compound reacts with water to produce acids, maybe C is a salt. For example, if C is a nitrate salt, but let me think. Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal nitrate. Let's think about the first reaction: A + 8B → C. If B is a diatomic gas, maybe like O2 or Cl2? Let's see.

Alternatively, considering common reactions, maybe A is a metal, B is Cl2, because 8 equivalents is a lot, which suggests perhaps a +8 oxidation state. Hmm, but metals typically don't go to +8. Or perhaps B is something else.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about the reaction where D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent. Common solvents include H2O, alcohol, maybe something like HCl, but HCl is a gas. Wait, H is a solvent, so maybe H is something like ethanol, or perhaps H is a solution, but in terms of products, perhaps H is something like H2O? Or maybe H is a different compound.

Wait, D reacts with B to form H. If B is O2, then maybe D is something like H2S (but that would produce SO2? Not sure). Alternatively, if B is Cl2, then D could be H2, so H is HCl? But HCl is a gas, not a solvent. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: If D and B form H which is a solvent, perhaps H is something like H2O. So if B is O2 and D is H2, then H would be H2O. But that would require 2 H2 and O2 to form 2 H2O. But the ratio is 1:1 for D and B. So D and B in 1:1 to make H. If H is H2O, then D would need to be H2 and B would be O2. Because 2 H2 + O2 → 2 H2O. But that's a 2:1 ratio of H2 to O2, not 1:1. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe B is Cl2 and D is H2. Then H would be HCl, but that's a gas, not a solvent. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps B is O2 and D is CH4? CH4 + 2O2 → CO2 + 2H2O. That wouldn't fit the 1:1 ratio. Alternatively, maybe D is something else.

Alternatively, maybe H is NH3. Then if B is H2O, and D is NH3, but that would require the reaction of B and D to form something else. Not sure.

This is getting a bit tangled. Let me try another angle. Let's look at reaction 2: C + 2D → E. E is extremely hazardous. Maybe E is something like phosgene (but that's COCl2), or perhaps something like sarin gas, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps C is a nitrate salt. Let me think: If C reacts with water to form A, F, and G. If F is a strong acid and G a weak one, perhaps C is a nitrate salt that upon hydrolysis produces nitric acid (strong) and another acid. Alternatively, maybe C is a sulfite or sulfate.

Wait, another possibility. Let's think about what produces two different acids when it reacts with water. Maybe C is a metal carbonate. For example, sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) reacts with water to produce NaOH (a strong base, but wait, no, because F and G are acids). Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal sulfite? Or maybe a nitride?

Wait, perhaps C is a nitride, like Mg3N2. Mg3N2 + 6 H2O → 3 Mg(OH)2 + 2 NH3. But NH3 is a weak base. Wait, but F and G are acids. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfide, like FeS. FeS + 2 H2O → Fe(OH)2 + H2S. But H2S is a weak acid. So F and G would be Fe(OH)2 (but that's a base) and H2S (acid). Hmm, but F is a strong acid and G is a weak acid. So maybe C is something else.

Alternatively, maybe C is a nitrate salt, like Ca(NO3)2. When it reacts with water, it would just dissociate into Ca^2+ and NO3^- ions. But that wouldn't produce acids. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps C is a metal oxide. Let's say C is Al2O3. When Al2O3 reacts with water, it forms Al(OH)3, which is amphoteric. But then, where are the acids coming from? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfate, like Na2SO4. When it reacts with water, it doesn't produce acids. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps C is a nitrate, and when it reacts with water, it produces something. Wait, nitrates are generally stable, but maybe in acidic conditions? Not sure.

Let me think again about reaction 3: C + H2O → A + F + G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. So maybe C is a salt of a strong base and a weak base. For example, if C is sodium sulfide, Na2S. Na2S + 2 H2O → 2 NaOH + H2S↑. So here, NaOH is a strong base, and H2S is a weak acid. But in the question, F and G are acids, not base. So perhaps C is something like a nitride. Alternatively, maybe it's a nitrate that decomposes upon heating, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle. Let's consider that reaction 1: A + 8B → C. A is a solid, B is a gas. 8 equivalents of B. If B is O2, then perhaps A is a metal that forms an oxide with O2. For example, Pb reacting with O2 to form PbO2. PbO2 is a bright red solid. Oh, wait, that's a possibility. PbO2 is a bright red solid, so C could be PbO2.

Wait, lead(IV) oxide is bright red. So if A is Pb metal and B is O2, then reaction would be 2 Pb + 5 O2 → 2 PbO2. But that's 5 equivalents of O2. In the question, it's 8 equivalents. Hmm, but perhaps I'm on the right track.

Alternatively, perhaps A is another metal. Let's think about other metals. For example, vanadium pentoxide is bright orange, not red. Maybe copper? But copper(II) oxide is black. Chromium trioxide is orange. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: Perhaps A is Cu, and B is Cl2. Then, Cu reacts with Cl2 to form CuCl2. But that's not a bright red product. Alternatively, maybe it's a different reaction.

Alternatively, the reaction could be the formation of a dichromate. For example, K2Cr2O7 is orange-red. But I'm not sure.

Wait, back to PbO2. Its formula is PbO2, so the reaction would be 2 Pb(s) + 5 O2(g) → 2 PbO2(s). So that's 5 equivalents of O2. But the problem states 8 equivalents. Maybe the stoichiometry is different.

Alternatively, maybe A is Fe and B is O2, but FeO is not bright red. Fe3O4 is black. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a nitride. Wait, some nitrides have colors, but I'm not sure about red.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfide. For example, PbS is a dark brown solid, not red. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe it's a different oxide. Wait, MnO2 is a dark purple solid. Not red. Hmm.

Wait, maybe it's not an oxide. What about a chloride? If A is a metal and B is Cl2, perhaps forming a chloride with a high oxidation state. For example, if A is K and B is Cl2, then 2 K + Cl2 → 2 KCl. But that's not red. Alternatively, perhaps it's a diatomic molecule.

Wait, perhaps C is a transition metal complex. For example, some transition metal ions form colored compounds. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, let's think about the reaction in reaction 3 where C reacts with water to produce two acids. If C is lead dioxide (PbO2), then:

PbO2 + H2O → PbO + O2 + 2 H+ ?

Wait, or perhaps it's a decomposition reaction. Wait, but I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, maybe PbO2 reacts with water and acid.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a different compound. Let me think about the second reaction: C + 2D → E. E is extremely hazardous. If C is PbO2, then D could be a gas that reacts with it to form something dangerous. For example, maybe D is H2S. Then, PbO2 + H2S might form PbS and H2O, but I'm not sure if that's dangerous.

Alternatively, perhaps D is H2. Then, PbO2 + H2 might form Pb and water. But that might not form a dangerous compound E.

Alternatively, maybe C is a nitrate. For example, Pb(NO3)2 is a nitrate. Then, reacting with D (what could D be?) to form E. But Pb(NO3)2 is soluble and not extremely hazardous.

Wait, maybe E is something like phosgene? But I need to think about the reagents.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a peroxide. For example, H2O2. But in that case, C would be H2O2, and reacting with D would form something. But the first reaction would be A + 8B → H2O2. That seems unlikely.

Wait, let me think about the reaction where D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent. So D + B → H. H is a solvent.

If H is H2O, then D and B must be something that reacts to form H2O. For example, if B is O2 and D is H2, then 2 H2 + O2 → 2 H2O. The ratio here is 2:1 (H2 to O2), but the question says D and B are in 1:1 ratio. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps B is Cl2 and D is H2. Then, H would be HCl, which is a gas, not a solvent. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe B is F2 and D is H2. So H would be HF, which is a weak acid and a solvent. Hmm, HF is a liquid, but I'm not sure if that's considered a solvent in this context. Maybe, but let's think.

Wait, another possibility: B is CO2 and D is H2O. But that would not make sense as a reaction. Alternatively, perhaps B is another gas.

Wait, maybe B is NH3 and D is something else. But NH3 is a gas, but in the presence of a solvent... Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps B is O2 and D is C (carbon). Then, reacting 1:1 would give CO or CO2. But that's not a solvent.

Wait, another approach: Let's consider what E is. Since E is produced from C and D, and it's extremely hazardous, perhaps it's a nerve agent or a highly toxic gas. For example, phosgene (COCl2), sarin, or something like that. Alternatively, maybe it's a cyanide compound.

Wait, if E is phosgene, then what would C and D be? Phosgene is COCl2. So perhaps C is COCl and D is Cl2. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is Cl2O and D is COCl2. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, let's think about the reaction C + 2 D → E. If E is phosgene, which is COCl2, then perhaps C is CO (carbon monoxide) and D is Cl2. Because CO + 2 Cl2 → COCl2? But that's not a balanced reaction. Wait, CO + 2 Cl2 → COCl2 + Cl2? No, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, maybe C is ClO- and D is Cl2. But not sure.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to go back and think about each reaction.

Reaction 1: A(s) + 8 B(g) → C(s, bright red)

Reaction 3: C(s) + H2O → A(s) + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid)

So C is likely a salt that upon hydrolysis gives a metal (A), and two acids. Since F is strong and G weak, maybe C is a sulfite or something similar. Wait, for example, if C is sodium sulfite (Na2SO3), then upon hydrolysis, it would form NaOH (strong base, but F and G are acids, so that doesn't fit). Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe C is a nitride. For instance, Ca3N2. When it reacts with water, it produces NH3 (weak base) and Ca(OH)2 (strong base). Again, not matching because F and G are acids.

Wait, perhaps C is a chlorate? Let's think, but I don't see it.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe C is a metal carbonate. For example, CaCO3. When it reacts with water, it doesn't really react unless in an acidic solution. So that might not produce acids.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfate. But again, not seeing the production of acids.

Wait, perhaps C is a metal oxide. For example, if C is a metal oxide that reacts with water to form a base and release an acid. Hmm, but that's not common. Most metal oxides either are basic or amphoteric.

Wait, what about if C is a superoxide? For example, KO2. KO2 reacts with water to form O2, KOH, and H2O2. But again, not sure how that fits.

Alternatively, maybe C is a peroxide. Na2O2 reacts with water to form O2, NaOH, and H2O. So then F would be H2O (but that's not an acid), which doesn't fit.

Hmm, maybe I'm stuck here. Let me think about the other reactions.

Reaction 4: D + B → H, which is a solvent. So what if H is something like ethanol (CH3CH2OH), but then D and B would have to combine to make ethanol. Alternatively, H is maybe H2O, but as before, the stoichiometry doesn't fit.

Wait, another thought: Maybe H is NH3, which is a solvent. Then D and B could be something like N2 and H2. But then, N2 + H2 → NH3, which requires high pressure and catalyst, but the ratio is 1:1. So if B is H2 and D is N2, then 1 N2 + 3 H2 → 2 NH3. But that's 3 H2 per N2, so ratio is 3:1. Not matching the 1:1 in the problem.

Alternatively, maybe H is H2O. Then, D and B could be H2 and O2. But as I thought earlier, the reaction is 2 H2 + O2 → 2 H2O, which is a 2:1 ratio. So that doesn't fit the 1:1 ratio.

Alternatively, perhaps D is Cl2 and B is H2O. Then, maybe D + B → HCl? But that's not a solvent. Alternatively, perhaps B is O2 and D is CH4, but then the reaction would be CH4 + 2 O2 → CO2 + 2 H2O. Again, not a 1:1 ratio.

Hmm. Maybe I should try a different approach. Let's think about the reaction in reaction 3 again. C reacts with water to produce A, F (strong acid), and G (weak acid). So, perhaps C is a nitrate ester, which upon hydrolysis produces a nitric acid (strong) and another acid.

Wait, if C is something like methyl nitrite (HNO2·CH3O), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe C is a nitro compound.

Alternatively, maybe C is a sulfonate ester. For example, tosyl chloride (TsCl) reacts with water to produce tosylate acid and HCl. So TsCl + H2O → TsOH + HCl. In this case, F would be HCl (strong acid) and G would be TsOH (a strong acid as well). But the problem states F is strong and G is weak, so that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps C is a chlorozinc compound? Hmm, not sure.

Wait, another thought: What if C is a metal carbonate that upon heating decomposes. Wait, but that's not with water.

Alternatively, maybe C is a chlorate. For example, KClO3. When heated, it decomposes into KCl and O2. But that's not with water.

Hmm. I'm not making much progress so far. Let me try to think about reaction 2: C + 2D → E, where E is extremely hazardous. If E is sarin, then perhaps C is something like a phosphoryl chloride and D is something else. But I'm not certain.

Wait, sarin is (OP(O)(CH2CH2O)3)P. Hmm, not sure about that. Alternatively, maybe E is phosgene, which is O=CCl2. Phosgene is a highly toxic gas.

So if E is phosgene, then C + 2D → O=CCl2.

Assuming E is phosgene (COCl2), what could C and D be? For example, if C is CO (carbon monoxide) and D is Cl2, then the reaction would be CO + 2 Cl2 → COCl2 + Cl2? No, that's not balanced. Alternatively, perhaps C is O=C=O (CO2) and D is Cl2. But that would require a different reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps C is Cl2O and D is ClO2? Not sure.

Wait, another angle. If D reacts with B in 1:1 to form H, a solvent. Let's think of H as something like ethanol. Then, D and B would be something that forms ethanol. But I don't know a gas B and another gas D that would make ethanol. Unless it's a reaction like CO + H2 → CH3OH (methanol), but that's under specific conditions. Alternatively, maybe B is CO2 and D is H2O. But that doesn't react to form anything.

Wait, perhaps H is something like formaldehyde. Then D and B would need to form HCHO. But I'm not sure what gases would do that.

Alternatively, maybe H is something like H2O. If D and B are H2 and O2, but as before, the ratio is 2:1, not 1:1.

Hmm. Maybe I'm going down the wrong path here. Let me try to think of E's structure and its molecular symmetry.

The options are symmetry groups: C2, D4h, D∞h, C2v.

These are all point groups. Let's think about what E could be. If E is phosgene (O=C=Cl2), its structure is a central carbon double-bonded to oxygen and single-bonded to two Cl atoms. The molecule is planar with a C2 axis (through the carbon and oxygen) and mirror planes. The point group of phosgene is D∞h, but wait, no. Wait, the molecule has a C2 axis, a mirror plane, and other symmetry elements. Alternatively, maybe it's D∞h or C2v.

Wait, let me think about the structure of phosgene. The structure is O=C(Cl)2. So the central carbon is double-bonded to O and single-bonded to two Cl atoms. The molecule is planar, with a central C=O. The symmetry elements would include a C2 axis perpendicular to the plane (since the molecule is planar and has a mirror plane through the central C=O). Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a C2 axis along the C=O bond.

Wait, no, in phosgene, the molecule is planar, so the symmetry is similar to that of O=C=S (thiocyanogen), which has a D∞h symmetry. But wait, I think phosgene has a D∞h symmetry. Because it's a linear molecule with a center of inversion and multiple symmetry planes. Alternatively, perhaps it's C2v, which has a C2 axis and two vertical mirror planes.

Wait, let me think about the point groups. D∞h is a dihedral group with infinite-fold rotation and reflection planes. It's the symmetry of a linear molecule with a center of inversion and multiple mirror planes. So for phosgene, which is O=C(Cl)2, the molecule is linear, so it would have D∞h symmetry.

Alternatively, if E is something else. For example, if E is a tetrahedral molecule, like CH4, the point group is Td. But that's not an option here.

Wait, another possibility: If E is a molecule with a two-fold axis (C2) and some mirror planes, perhaps C2v. For example, H2O has C2v symmetry. But H2O is not extremely hazardous, so maybe not.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again about each reaction.

If C is PbO2, then when it reacts with water, perhaps it can form PbO, and some other products. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps C is something like a chromate ester. For example, if C is a chromate, then reacting with water would produce chromic acid (H2CrO4, strong acid) and another acid.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction in reaction 3 is the hydrolysis of a nitro compound. For example, nitrobenzene hydrolyzes to produce phenol and nitric acid. But nitrobenzene is a solid. If C is nitrobenzene, then hydrolysis would give phenol (weak acid) and HNO3 (strong acid). So F is HNO3, G is phenol.

But then, what is C? Nitrobenzene. Then, reaction 1 would be A + 8B → C. So A is perhaps benzene, and B is something that adds a nitro group. But benzene reacting with 8 equivalents of a gas B to form nitrobenzene? I'm not sure. Nitrobenzene typically is formed via nitration with HNO3 and H2SO4, not with a gas.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about E's structure and its symmetry group.

If E has D∞h symmetry, that would suggest it's a linear molecule with multiple symmetry planes. So, perhaps E is something like O=C=O (carbon dioxide), which has D∞h symmetry. But carbon dioxide isn't extremely hazardous.

Wait, another possibility: E is something like O=SCl2 (thionyl chloride), which is a toxic gas. Thionyl chloride has the structure O=S(Cl)2. It's a trigonal planar molecule with a C2 axis (through S and O) and mirror planes, so its point group is D∞h.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, O=SCl2 has a structure where S is double-bonded to O and single-bonded to two Cl atoms, similar to phosgene. So, its point group would be the same as phosgene, which is D∞h.

If E is O=SCl2, then perhaps C is O=S and D is Cl2. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps E is phosgene (O=C(Cl)2), which has D∞h symmetry. So the molecular symmetry group would be D∞h.

Looking at the options, option C is D∞h.

So, putting it all together, the answer would be option C.
