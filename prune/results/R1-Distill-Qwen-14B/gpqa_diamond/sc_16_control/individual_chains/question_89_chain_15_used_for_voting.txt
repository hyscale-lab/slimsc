Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about.

The question involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember that adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have bromine atoms on positions 1 and 3. 

First reaction: Heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with excess KOH at 240°C. KOH is a strong base, so maybe it's an elimination reaction. Oh wait, when vicinal dihalides (adjacent) react with strong bases, they usually undergo dehydrohalogenation to form alkenes. But wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane isn't vicinal—it's 1 and 3 positions apart. So that might not eliminate directly. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's a double elimination. Oh wait, KOH might abstract a beta hydrogen, leading to the formation of a double bond. Wait, but two bromines are on adjacent carbons only if the structure is such. Wait, adamantane is a polycyclic structure, so maybe 1 and 3 are on adjacent positions in a way that allows for elimination.

Wait, maybe I should think about the product. The product is a light yellow solid, and the NMR shows 4.79 ppm as a doublet integrating for 2H. Also, IR has a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is indicative of a carbonyl group, like a ketone. So maybe the product is an diketone? Wait, but 1,3-dibromoadamantane upon dehydrohalogenation would form a double bond. Wait, no, but if two eliminations occur, perhaps forming a conjugated diene? But the IR doesn't show a peak for a C=C. Wait, IR at 1720 is more likely a carbonyl, maybe a ketone or ester.

Wait, maybe the KOH is causing a different kind of reaction. Oh wait, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation but leading to a ketone. Hmm, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Williamson-type elimination, but I'm not sure. Wait, another thought: if the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, heating with KOH could lead to the formation of a cyclopropane ring. Like, when two vicinal dihalides eliminate, perhaps via a double E2 mechanism, forming a cyclopropane. But wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane might have the bromines on adjacent positions on a bridge, making elimination possible to form a bridgehead cyclopropane.

Wait, but the product has a carbonyl group in IR. Maybe it's an oxidation. Wait, but KOH is a base, not an oxidizing agent. Alternatively, maybe the elimination forms a ketone via some rearrangement. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Fittig reaction, where two aryl halides react to form a biaryl, but that seems unrelated here.

Wait, maybe I should think about the structure of adamantane. Adamantane has a structure similar to diamond, with four cyclohexane rings fused together. 1 and 3 positions would be on adjacent bridgeheads. So when you have two bromines on bridgeheads, perhaps elimination forms a bridge between those positions, leading to a smaller ring.

Wait, if 1,3-dibromoadamantane undergoes dehydrohalogenation with KOH, maybe each Br leaves, and the adjacent Hs are abstracted, leading to a cyclopropane ring. Because two adjacent bridgeheads would form a three-membered ring. So the product would be adamantane with a cyclopropane bridge. But then, why the NMR shows a peak at 4.79 ppm with 2H? That region is usually for CH2 groups adjacent to oxygen, like ethers or esters, or maybe something else. Alternatively, if the product is a ketone, then perhaps the bridgehead carbons have become carbonyls.

Wait, another approach: the initial product is a diketone. Because the IR shows a strong peak at 1720, which is a ketone. So perhaps each Br is replaced by a carbonyl group. But wait, that would require oxidation. But KOH is a base, not an oxidizing agent. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe it's a Robinson annulation or some kind of ring formation leading to a ketone. Wait, perhaps the base induces a ring-opening and then a carbonyl formation. No, I'm not sure.

Wait, considering the NMR data. The 1H NMR of product 1 has:

- 4.79 ppm (2H)
- 2.41-2.23 (10H)
- 1.94 (2H)

The 4.79 ppm is likely a CH2 group next to an oxygen. Since IR shows a carbonyl, maybe it's an ester or a ketone. But wait, if it's a ketone, then the adjacent CH2 would be around δ 2.1, but here the 4.79 is a separate group. Alternatively, maybe it's a diol, but that wouldn't fit with the IR.

Wait, another thought: the initial reaction could be a double elimination to form a cyclopropane ring, which would be a bridge in the adamantane structure. Then, perhaps the product is a bicyclic compound with a cyclopropane ring. But how does that explain the NMR and IR?

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation forming a bridge, but I'm not getting it. Let me think about the possible product. Oh! Wait, maybe the reaction is a Dieckmann cyclization? No, that's for esters. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the KOH is causing the formation of an epoxide, but that would require an alkene. But wait, the IR doesn't show a peak for an epoxide, which usually has a peak around 1250 cm-1 for the C-O stretch. The IR here is at 1720, which is more like a ketone.

Wait, perhaps the product is adamantanone. Adamantane with a ketone group. But then, how would that form from two bromines? Maybe each Br is replaced by a carbonyl group? But that would require oxidation, which KOH doesn't typically do. Alternatively, perhaps one elimination forms a carbonyl. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the initial product is 1,3-diketone adamantane. So the Brs are replaced by O groups. But how?

Alternatively, maybe the product is a diepoxide, but that doesn't fit the NMR.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's move to the second step and see if that helps.

The second step: Product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. Aluminum isopropoxide is a Lewis acid catalyst, often used in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. But wait, if product 1 is a ketone, like adamantanone, then perhaps it's undergoing some kind of Friedel-Crafts reaction. But adamantane is already a polycyclic structure, maybe as a catalyst for something else.

Alternatively, considering that product 1 has a carbonyl, perhaps product 2 is an enol ether or something with an oxygen ring. Wait, another possibility: if product 1 is a ketone, Al isopropoxide could facilitate some kind of ring expansion or a pinacol rearrangement. Alternatively, maybe product 1 is a diol, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe product 1 is a diol, but that doesn't fit the IR. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an epoxide, but again, the IR doesn't seem to support that.

Alternatively, the initial product is a carbonyl-containing compound, perhaps a diketone, with two ketone groups. Then, when treated with Al isopropoxide, maybe it undergoes some kind of ring-opening or ring-forming reaction.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think again.

The initial reaction: 1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH → product 1 with ketone.

But how? Maybe the KOH is causing a double dehydrohalogenation. Each Br is replaced by a carbonyl group. So, maybe each Br is converted to an O group.

Wait, but that would require oxidation, which KOH doesn't do. Unless it's an elimination leading to a carbonyl. Oh! Wait, when you have a dihalide, you can eliminate two equivalents of HX (here, HBr) to form a double bond. But if the two X are on adjacent carbons, then elimination would form a double bond. But if they're not adjacent, perhaps a different process.

Wait, maybe the structure of 1,3-dibromoadamantane allows for the two Brs to be on adjacent bridgeheads, making elimination possible. So, perhaps each Br is on a bridgehead, and elimination would form a bridge between them, creating a new ring. But the product would have a double bond.

Alternatively, perhaps the elimination leads to a cyclopropane ring.

Wait, but the product has a carbonyl. So maybe each elimination leads to a carbonyl. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a case of a pinacol-like rearrangement, but that requires vicinal diols, which I don't think is the case here.

Wait, another approach: the 1H NMR of product 1 has a peak at 4.79 ppm for 2H. That region often corresponds to CH2 groups adjacent to an oxygen, like in ethers or esters. So perhaps the product is a diol or an ether.

Wait, but the IR peak at 1720 could be a ketone. So maybe the product is an epoxide, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I should think about the overall process. After the first reaction, product 1 is a ketone. Then, product 2 is formed by heating with Al isopropoxide. Then, product 3 is formed by ozonolysis of product 2.

Wait, ozonolysis is usually used to cleave alkenes into carbonyl compounds. So if product 2 has a double bond, ozonolysis would break it. So let's think: product 2 must have a double bond because ozonolysis is next.

So, product 1 → product 2 (with a double bond) → product 3 (from ozonolysis).

So, step one: 1,3-dibromoadamantane → product 1 (maybe a diol?), which then undergoes a reaction to form product 2 with a double bond.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a diol. Then, when treated with Al isopropoxide, maybe it undergoes elimination to form a double bond. So, product 2 would have a double bond, and the ozonolysis would break it into carbonyl compounds.

But wait, the IR of product 1 shows a peak at 1720, which is a carbonyl. So if product 1 is a ketone, then product 2 would have a double bond adjacent to it, perhaps.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a ketone, and product 2 is an enone (a conjugated enone). Then, ozonolysis would break the double bond, giving two carbonyl groups.

But I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to piece it together.

Product 1: 1,3-dibromoadamantane treated with KOH → product 1. NMR of product 1 shows a doublet at 4.79 ppm (2H), and IR at 1720 cm-1.

Maybe product 1 is an epoxide. But wait, the IR of epoxides usually has peaks around 1250 cm-1, not 1720. So that's probably not it.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a ketone. Let's say it's 1,3-diketone adamantane. Then, product 2 is formed by heating with Al isopropoxide, which is a Lewis acid. Maybe it's a Friedel-Crafts acylation, but adamantane isn't an aromatic ring. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diol, and Al isopropoxide induces elimination to form a double bond. So product 2 is an alkene, which then undergoes ozonolysis.

Wait, but product 1's IR is 1720, which is a carbonyl. So if product 1 is a diol, that doesn't fit. Wait, maybe product 1 is a diepoxide? But again, the IR doesn't fit.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something about the first reaction. Let me think again.

1,3-dibromoadamantane heated with excess KOH. KOH is a strong base. Maybe it's a double elimination, each Br leaving as Br- and H being abstracted, leading to a cyclopropane ring. So the product would be a cyclopropane bridged adamantane.

Then, cyclopropane rings are strained, but when they undergo ring-opening, they can form diradicals or other structures. Wait, but how does that produce a light yellow solid? Maybe the cyclopropane is in a bridged position, making it stable.

The NMR of product 1 has 4.79 ppm (2H). If the cyclopropane is part of the structure, maybe the adjacent carbons have hydrogens that are deshielded. But 4.79 is a bit high for cyclopropane CH2, which is usually around 1.5-2.5 ppm. So maybe that's not it.

Wait, another possibility: the product is a geminal diol. But that would require two hydroxyl groups on the same carbon, which seems unlikely from this reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a carbonyl group and an adjacent group. For example, one Br is replaced by an OH, and another by a carbonyl group. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the NMR of product 1 has 4.79 ppm (2H) which is likely an -OCH2O- group, like in a diether, but that's speculative.

Alternatively, it's a -CH2-O- group, but the IR doesn't show an O-H stretch, which is usually around 3300 cm-1. So maybe it's not a diol.

Hmm. Maybe I should look at the next steps to get a better idea.

Product 2 is formed by heating product 1 with Al isopropoxide. Then, product 2 is ozonolyzed to form product 3.

Ozonolysis breaks double bonds. So product 2 must have a double bond. So the previous step (product 1 → product 2) must involve the formation of a double bond.

So, product 1 might have a hydroxyl group, and product 2 is an alkene formed by elimination.

Wait, but product 1's IR shows a carbonyl. So perhaps product 1 is a ketone and product 2 is an enone.

Let me think again. Maybe the first reaction forms a ketone with two adjacent CH2 groups.

Wait, perhaps the first reaction forms an epoxide, but that doesn't fit the IR. Alternatively, maybe it's a conjugated diene.

Wait, maybe the initial product is a cyclopropane, and when treated with Al isopropoxide, it undergoes a ring-opening to form a diol, which then forms a double bond upon heating. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial product is a diketone, and when treated with Al isopropoxide, it undergoes a pinacol-like rearrangement, forming a double bond.

Wait, the pinacol rearrangement involves 1,2-diols (vicinal diols) losing water to form a carbonyl compound and a double bond. But product 1 would have to be a diol then, but the IR suggests a ketone.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck here, but let's try to proceed.

Assuming that product 2 has a double bond, the ozonolysis would cleave it. Ozonolysis of a diene would give two carbonyl groups. Then, product 3 would have carbonyl groups where the double bond was.

But the question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3. The options are various splitting patterns.

The most deshielded hydrogen would likely be near an electronegative atom or in a conjugated system. After ozonolysis, perhaps the structure has carbonyl groups adjacent to CH2 groups.

Wait, another thought: if product 2 is a diene, ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl groups. But if the diene is part of a ring, ozonolysis might break the ring and form a chain with carbonyl groups.

Alternatively, if the diene is in a bridge structure, ozonolysis could form two ketones connected by a chain.

Wait, let's think about the possible structure of product 2. Suppose product 2 is an alkene adjacent to a ketone group. Ozonolysis would break the double bond into two carbonyl groups. For example, if product 2 is something like CH2=CH-C(O)R, then ozonolysis would give two carbonyl compounds.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe product 2 is a bridged bicyclic compound with a double bond, and ozonolysis would cleave it into smaller fragments.

Wait, but the initial problem is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen. So perhaps product 3 has a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl, and that CH2's hydrogen is the most deshielded.

In such a case, the protons on the CH2 next to the carbonyl would be deshielded, and their coupling would depend on the neighboring groups.

If the CH2 is next to a carbonyl and has neighboring protons, what would their coupling pattern be? For example, in an ester group, the CH2 next to the carbonyl is usually split into a triplet if adjacent to another CH2 group, but it depends on the structure.

Wait, but let's think about the possible structure after ozonolysis. Suppose the ozonolysis breaks a double bond into two carbonyl groups, leading to a structure where a CH2 group is between two carbonyls.

Wait, another scenario: if the ozonolysis produces a diketone, then the adjacent CH2 would have two neighboring groups. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the ozonolysis produces a compound like CH2(CO)R, where the CH2 is next to the carbonyl.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck on the exact structure. Maybe I should think about the possible splitting patterns.

The options are:

A) triplet
B) triplet of triplets
C) doublet of triplets
D) pentet

The most deshielded proton is likely to be near an electronegative group, such as a carbonyl. The splitting is determined by neighboring protons.

If the proton is adjacent to a CH2 group with two protons, it would split into a triplet. If it's adjacent to a CH group with two neighboring protons, it might split into a triplet of triplets (if two different couplings), or a doublet of triplets, etc.

Wait, another approach: in ozonolysis, the double bond is cleaved, and the resulting carbonyl groups are formed. The adjacent carbons would each have their own protons, which might couple with each other.

Suppose product 3 has a structure like O=C-R-CH2-CH2-CO=O. Then, the CH2 groups adjacent to the carbonyls would have their protons split by neighboring groups.

Alternatively, if the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-CO-OH (though more likely without the OH), then each CH2 would have neighboring CH2 groups, leading to a triplet.

Wait, maybe the structure is something like O=C-CH2-CH2-CO, and the CH2 in the middle would have coupling with two neighboring CH2 groups, leading to a triplet of triplets?

Alternatively, if each CH2 is adjacent to another CH2, which is adjacent to another group, the splitting could get more complex.

Alternatively, perhaps the most deshielded hydrogen is a CH2 group next to a carbonyl, with two neighboring groups on either side, each with two protons. So, the hydrogen would be split by two neighboring groups, each with J coupling. For instance, if each side has two protons, that would be a triplet on each side, leading to a triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, maybe each hydrogen is coupled with two different sets of protons. For example, a CH2 group next to a carbonyl and adjacent to another CH2 group which in turn is next to another CH2. Then, the splitting would be more complex.

But I'm not entirely sure. Let me try to think about the possible structures again.

Product 1: After KOH treatment, forms a ketone.

Product 2: Product 1 is treated with Al isopropoxide, a Lewis acid, which might induce elimination to form a double bond. So, product 2 is an enone (a conjugated ketone and double bond).

Ozonolysis of product 2 would cleave the double bond, and the ketone would remain. So, product 3 would have two carbonyl groups from the ozonolysis.

Wait, but ozonolysis of an enone might not just break the double bond but could lead to different products, perhaps via some rearrangement.

Alternatively, ozonolysis followed by workup (with dimethyl sulfide) typically cleaves double bonds into carbonyl groups. So, if product 2 is an enone (conjugated double bond and ketone), ozonolysis would break the double bond into two carbonyl groups. So, product 3 would have two ketone groups.

Wait, but if product 2 is an enone like RC(O)CH2-CH2CO, then ozonolysis would cleave the double bond into two carbonyl groups, making something like RC(O)CH2-O and O-CH2CO. Hmm, but that's not likely. More accurately, ozonolysis of a conjugated diene would give two carbonyls, but in an enone, the double bond is between the alpha and beta carbons relative to the ketone.

Wait, perhaps product 2 is a dienone (a conjugated diene with a ketone). Ozonolysis would break each double bond, but in this case, it's a single double bond. So, ozonolysis would break it into a diketone.

Wait, let me think of a specific example. Suppose product 2 is something like:

O=C-R-CH2-CH2-CO-R'

Then, ozonolysis would break the central CH2-CH2 into two, forming O=C-R-O and O-CO-R', but that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps I'm thinking of it wrong.

Wait, another example: if product 2 is cyclohexene, ozonolysis would break it into two aldehyde groups. But in the case of a dienone, perhaps the ozonolysis would break the double bond into two carbonyls.

Wait, perhaps product 2 is something like:

O=C-CH2-CH2-CO

But that structure isn't correct. Alternatively, maybe it's a ring structure. Suppose product 2 is a bicyclic compound with a double bond inside, such as a bridged bicyclo structure with a double bond. Ozonolysis would break the double bond, leading to two carbonyl groups in the ring.

Hmm, this is getting complicated, but perhaps I should try to visualize the possible product 3.

If product 3 has a structure where a CH2 group is between two carbonyl groups, like O=C-CH2-CH2-CO, then the CH2 in the middle would be adjacent to two carbonyls. The protons on this CH2 would be split by the neighboring CH2 groups.

Wait, but in that structure, each CH2 would be next to another CH2. So, the central CH2 would have two neighboring CH2 groups on either side. Each of those CH2 groups has two protons, leading to coupling.

Wait, but in the NMR spectrum, the most deshielded hydrogen would be on the CH2 next to the carbonyl. So, each of those CH2 groups (adjacent to the carbonyl) would have their protons split by the neighboring CH2 group.

If each of those CH2 groups is adjacent to another CH2, each with two protons, then each proton would see two neighboring protons on each side, leading to a triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, perhaps the CH2 is adjacent to two different sets of protons. For example, if the CH2 group is next to a CH2 on one side and a CH on the other, leading to different coupling constants, which would result in more complex splitting.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the CH2 is next to another CH2, which is next to another CH2, leading to a triplet of triplets.

Wait, another thought: if the CH2 group is between two other CH2 groups, each with two protons, then each of the four neighboring protons would split the signal. But that's four protons, leading to a quintet (five peaks). Wait, but that would be the case if each proton is adjacent to four others, but I think each adjacent CH2 has two protons, so the splitting would be a triplet for each adjacent group.

Wait, for a CH2 group next to another CH2 group (each with two protons), the splitting would be a triplet. Because each proton in the neighboring group would split each proton in the CH2 into a doublet, but with two equivalent neighbors, it becomes a triplet.

But if the CH2 group is between two different CH2 groups, perhaps each with two protons, then each side would contribute a triplet. So the overall splitting would be a triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, if the CH2 is next to a group with two protons on one side and another group with two protons on the other, the splitting would be a triplet from each side, leading to a triplet of triplets.

So the coupling pattern would be a triplet of triplets, which is option B.

But wait, another possibility: if the CH2 is next to a CH group, which is next to another CH2, then the splitting would be more complex. For example, a CH group (like a methylene adjacent to a CH) could cause a doublet, and the adjacent CH2 could cause another splitting.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Based on the options, the most likely answer is option A, a triplet, but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, another approach: in product 3, the most deshielded proton is part of a CH2 group adjacent to two carbonyl groups. This CH2 would be next to two other CH2 groups on either side, each with two protons. So, each of these adjacent CH2 groups would split the signal into a triplet. Since there are two adjacent groups, the total splitting would be a triplet of triplets, which is option B.

Alternatively, if each adjacent CH2 is two protons away, perhaps it's a doublet of doublets or something else.

Wait, but each adjacent group is a CH2, so each has two protons. The splitting from each adjacent group would be a triplet. So, two triplets (from two adjacent groups) would multiply, leading to a triplet of triplets.

So, the coupling pattern would be a triplet of triplets, which is option B.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves a multi-step reaction sequence starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Here's the analysis:

1. **First Reaction (1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH):**  
   Heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH likely results in a dehydrohalogenation reaction. The IR spectrum of the product (product 1) shows a strong absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹, characteristic of a carbonyl group, suggesting the formation of a ketone. The NMR data (4.79 ppm, 2H) indicates the presence of a CH₂ group adjacent to an electronegative group, likely oxygen. Thus, product 1 is likely a diketone or a ketone with a CH₂ group near the carbonyl.

2. **Second Reaction (product 1 + Al isopropoxide):**  
   Aluminum isopropoxide, a Lewis acid, likely facilitates the formation of a double bond (alkene) in product 2. This is inferred because the subsequent ozonolysis step targets double bonds. Therefore, product 2 contains a conjugated system, possibly an enone (a ketone adjacent to a double bond).

3. **Third Reaction (product 2 + Ozonolysis):**  
   Ozonolysis cleaves the double bond in product 2, forming product 3. The cleavage of the double bond results in two carbonyl groups. The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is likely part of a CH₂ group adjacent to a carbonyl group. This CH₂ group is influenced by neighboring protons, leading to a specific coupling pattern.

4. **Analysis of Coupling Pattern in Product 3:**  
   The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is part of a CH₂ group adjacent to a carbonyl group. This CH₂ group is flanked by two other CH₂ groups, each with two protons. The splitting of the signal is determined by the neighboring protons. Each adjacent CH₂ group contributes a triplet splitting pattern, and the combination of two such triplets results in a **triplet of triplets**.

Thus, the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is a **triplet of triplets**.

**Answer: B**
