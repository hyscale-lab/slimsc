Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about Lagrangians and renormalizability. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my QFT, but let me try to think this through.

The problem gives a Lagrangian: L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. And σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]. They're asking about the mass dimension of κ and whether the theory is renormalizable.

Wait, I remember that in quantum field theory, each term in the Lagrangian has to have a mass dimension of 4 since the action is dimensionless (in natural units where ħ = c = 1). So each term in the Lagrangian density should have mass dimension 4.

The Lagrangian here is an interaction term, so let's figure out the dimensions of each part. Let me break it down.

First, the term is κ multiplied by ψ̄, then σ_{μν}, then ψ, and then F^{μν}.

I need to find the dimension of each component: ψ, σ_{μν}, F^{μν}, and then solve for κ.

So, for a Dirac spinor ψ, I think the mass dimension is 3/2. Because in 4 spacetime dimensions, the Dirac field has dimension [ψ] = 3/2. Right, because the Lagrangian kinetic term is ∂μ ψ̄ γ^μ ψ, which should have dimension 4. Each derivative ∂μ has dimension 1, so [∂μ ψ̄ γ^μ ψ] = [∂][ψ]^2 = 1 + (3/2)*2 = 1+3=4. Yep, that's correct.

Now, σ_{μν} is (i/2)[γ_mu, gamma_nu]. Since gamma matrices are dimensionless (they're just matrices), the commutator [γ_mu, gamma_nu] is also dimensionless. So σ_{μν} has the same dimension as the field derivatives, but wait no—I think σ_{μν} is built from the gamma matrices and the derivatives? Wait no, wait, the sigma is just a function of the gamma matrices, so it's a tensor made from gamma matrices, so σ_{μν} itself is a product of two gamma matrices, but more importantly, it's a structure that comes from the commutator. Hmm, wait, actually, in terms of dimension, each gamma matrix is dimensionless because they're just matrices (like the Pauli matrices). So [σ_{μν}] would be dimensionless? Or wait, no, because σ_{μν} is a tensor, but in terms of mass dimension, it's made from [γ_mu, γ_nu], which are both dimensionless. So σ_{μν} is dimensionless. So [σ] = 0.

Wait, but then what about F^{mu nu}? F is the field strength tensor for electromagnetism or something similar. The field strength tensor F is typically defined as ∂_mu A_nu - ∂_nu A_mu, right? So each A is a vector potential, which for electromagnetism would have [A] = 1, because the field strength F has to have dimension [mass]^2. Because the Maxwell term in the Lagrangian is F_{mu nu} F^{mu nu}, which must have dimension 4. So [F]^2 =4 → [F] =2. Wait, but F is ∂A, so [∂][A] = 1 + [A]. So [F]=1 + [A]. If [F]=2, then 1 + [A] =2 → [A]=1. So yeah, [A] =1, and [F]=2.

So back to the term: ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{mu nu}.

Each part's dimension:
- [ψ̄] = [ψ] = 3/2 each, because ψ̄ is the adjoint, same dimension as ψ.
So ψ̄ has dimension 3/2, ψ has 3/2. So ψ̄ σ ψ would be (3/2) + (3/2) = 3. Because sigma is dimensionless.

Wait, no: ψ̄ is a row vector, σ is a matrix, and ψ is a column vector. So when you contract indices, the dimensions multiply. Or, wait, the dimensions for each field multiply. So ψ̄ σ ψ is [ψ̄] * [σ] * [ψ] = (3/2) * (0) * (3/2) = 3/2 + 3/2 = 3? Wait, no, because [σ] is 0, so the product would be 3/2 * 3/2 = 3. Because each ψ is 3/2, and sigma is dimensionless, so when you multiply them, you add the exponents.

Wait, no, in terms of mass dimensions, [ψ̄] = [ψ] = 3/2. So ψ̄ times ψ would have dimension 3/2 + 3/2 = 3. And sigma is dimensionless, so ψ̄ σ ψ is still 3. Then F^{mu nu} has dimension 2. So the whole term is 3 + 2 =5. But the Lagrangian term must have dimension 4. So that's a problem.

Wait, but wait. The term is κ times that product. So the Lagrangian term is κ [ψ̄ σ ψ F], which has dimension [κ] + [ψ̄ σ ψ] + [F]. So [κ] + (3) + (2) must be 4, because each term in the Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4.

So [κ] +5 =4 → [κ] = -1.

So the mass dimension of κ is -1.

Now, about renormalizability. For a theory to be renormalizable, all the coupling constants must have positive mass dimension (or zero, I think). Because, in a renormalizable theory, the coupling constants have a mass dimension ≥ 0. Because if the dimension is negative, the interaction term becomes relevant, leading to a Landau pole or non-renormalizable theory.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. In 4 dimensions, a term in the Lagrangian must have dimension ≤4 for it to be renormalizable. So each coupling's dimension is [coupling] = 4 - (sum of fields' dimensions). For the interaction term to be renormalizable, the coupling must have a dimension that's at least 0. So, if the term has [coupling] <0, then the term would be non-renormalizable. Because a negative dimension means that the coupling becomes stronger at higher energies, leading to a non-predictive theory at high energies.

In our case, [κ] is -1. So [κ]=-1. So the coupling has a negative mass dimension. Therefore, the interaction is non-renormalizable. Because the dimension is negative, the theory is not renormalizable.

So the options are:

A) [κ]=-1, renormalizable? No, because [κ] is -1, so the theory is not renormalizable. So A is wrong.

Looking at the options:

Option C says [κ]=-1 and theory is not renormalizable.

Option D says [κ]=+1 and theory not renormalizable. But [κ] is -1, so D wrong.

Wait, wait, option D says [kappa]=1, which we've determined to be incorrect because we have [kappa]=-1.

So the correct option is C: [kappa]=-1, theory not renormalizable.

To determine the mass dimension of the coupling constant $\kappa$ and whether the theory is renormalizable, we analyze the given Lagrangian:

\[
\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}} = \kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu},
\]
where $\sigma_{\mu\nu} = \frac{i}{2}[\gamma_\mu, \gamma_\nu]$.

### Step 1: Mass dimensions of the fields
- The Dirac spinor $\psi$ has mass dimension $[\psi] = \frac{3}{2}$.
- The adjoint spinor $\bar{\psi}$ has the same dimension as $\psi$, $[\bar{\psi}] = \frac{3}{2}$.
- The field strength tensor $F^{\mu\nu}$ has mass dimension $[F^{\mu\nu}] = 2$, as it is derived from the derivative of the gauge field $A_\mu$, which has $[A_\mu] = 1$.
- The tensor $\sigma_{\mu\nu}$ is constructed from the commutator of dimensionless gamma matrices $\gamma_\mu$, so $[\sigma_{\mu\nu}] = 0$.

### Step 2: Dimension of the interaction term
The interaction term $\bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu}$ has the following mass dimension:
\[
[\bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu}] = [\bar{\psi}] + [\psi] + [\sigma_{\mu\nu}] + [F^{\mu\nu}].
\]
Substituting the dimensions:
\[
[\bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu}] = \frac{3}{2} + \frac{3}{2} + 0 + 2 = 5.
\]
Since the Lagrangian density must have mass dimension $4$, the coupling constant $\kappa$ must satisfy:
\[
[\kappa] + 5 = 4 \implies [\kappa] = -1.
\]

### Step 3: Renormalizability
A theory is renormalizable if all coupling constants have non-negative mass dimensions. In this case, $[\kappa] = -1$, which is negative. This indicates that the interaction term becomes relevant at high energies, leading to a non-renormalizable theory.

### Step 4: Evaluate the options
- **Option A**: $[\kappa] = -1$, theory is renormalizable. **Incorrect**, as the theory is not renormalizable.
- **Option B**: $[\kappa] = 1$, theory is renormalizable. **Incorrect**, as $[\kappa] = -1$, not $1$.
- **Option C**: $[\kappa] = -1$, theory is not renormalizable. **Correct**, as derived above.
- **Option D**: $[\kappa] = 1$, theory is not renormalizable. **Incorrect**, as $[\kappa] = -1$.

### Final Answer:
The mass dimension of $\kappa$ is $-1$, and the theory is not renormalizable.
