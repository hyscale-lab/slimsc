Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, I remember that the RV method measures the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravitational pull. So the star moves back and forth, and we see shifts in the spectral lines.

The problem says two stars with the same mass as the Sun. Each has a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. Both planets have circular orbits. So I don't have to worry about eccentricity affecting the shifts.

Planet #1 caused a shift of 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2 caused 7 milliangstroms. Wait, so the shift is related to the star's velocity, right? Because the Doppler shift depends on the velocity of the star towards or away from us.

I recall that the Doppler shift formula is something like Δλ/λ = v/c, where v is the velocity and c is the speed of light. But here, we're given the wavelength shift (Δλ) directly. So for each planet, the maximum velocity of the star (v) would cause that shift.

So let me think: the velocity semi-amplitude K (which is the maximum velocity of the star) is proportional to the Doppler shift. So K is proportional to Δλ. Since both stars are the same mass, and the planets have same mass, does that affect K?

Wait, no. The RV method's measured velocity semi-amplitude K depends on several factors: the planet's mass, the inclination of the orbit (which we assume is optimal, so sin(i)=1), the orbital period, and the distance of the planet from the star. Oh but wait, the formula for K is given by:

K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^0.5 ) ) )^(1/3) * (1 / ( (P * (1 day in seconds))^(1/3) )) )

But since M_p is much less than M_star (sun-like stars and Neptune mass planet), M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. So K ≈ ( (G * M_p ) / ( M_star ) )^(1/3) * (1 / (P^(1/3) ) )

Wait, but wait, the exact formula for K is:

K = [ ( (27 * pi * G) / (c^3) )^(1/3) ) * ( M_p sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) (1 - e²)^(0.5) ) ) ] * ( P / ( (1 - e²)^0.5 ) )^(1/3) )

Wait, that's getting complicated. Alternatively, I've heard that the semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_p / M_star) * (1 / P)^(1/3) ) * something, but perhaps I should approach this differently.

Wait, the problem gives us the same shifts for two planets. Since the shifts (Δλ) are proportional to the velocity K, then K1/K2 = 5/7.

So K1 = (5/7) K2.

But I need to find the ratio of the orbital periods, P2 / P1.

Wait, the RV method: K is the semi-amplitude of the star's velocity. So K is related to the planet's mass and the orbital period. 

I remember that the RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = (2π G)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / [ ( (M_star + M_p) )^(2/3) * (1 - e²)^(0.5) ) * (P)^(1/3) ) ] * (1/c) )

But since M_p << M_star and e is zero (circular orbit), this simplifies to:

K ≈ (2π G)^(1/3) * (M_p) / [ (M_star)^(2/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) ] * (1/c)

But since M_p and M_star are the same for both planets (as the stars are same mass and planets have same mass), the ratio of K1 to K2 would be inversely proportional to the cube root of the ratio of their periods.

Wait, because K is inversely proportional to (P)^(1/3), so K ∝ 1 / P^(1/3).

So K1 / K2 = (P2 / P1)^(1/3 )

Given that K1 is 5 and K2 is 7 (since the shifts are 5 and 7 milliangstroms, so K1=5, K2=7). Wait, no, wait. Wait the shift is directly proportional to the velocity. So for the same star (same c, same G, same M_star, same M_p), K is proportional to 1 / (P^(1/3)).

So K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3).

Given that K1 is 5 and K2 is7, then 5/7 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

So cube both sides: (5/7)^3 = P2/P1.

Calculating (5/7)^3: 5^3 is 125, 7^3 is 343. So 125/343 ≈ 0.364.

So P2 is approximately 0.364 times P1. So the orbital period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times that of planet #1. So P2/P1 ≈ 0.36.

Wait, but the question asks "How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?"

So P2 = 0.36 * P1 → P2 is shorter, so the ratio P2 / P1 is 0.36. So planet #2's orbital period is 0.36 times that of planet #1. So it is shorter, meaning planet #2's period is shorter. So the question is, how many times longer is planet #2’s period compared to planet #1? Because if P2 is 0.36 * P1, then it's shorter, so it's not longer. So the answer would be approximately 0.36 times, which would make P2 shorter. So the question is asking for P2 longer than P1, which would be 0.36 times, but that's shorter, not longer. So perhaps I got the ratio backwards.

Wait, let me think again. Let me write down the equation again.

K ∝ 1 / (P^(1/3)).

So K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

We have K1 =5, K2=7. So 5/7 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

So (5/7)^3 = P2/P1 → 125/343 ≈ 0.364.

So P2 = 0.364 * P1 → P2 is shorter. So planet #2's period is about 0.36 times that of planet #1. So it’s shorter, so the question is how many times longer is P2 than P1? So it's 0.36 times as long → so 0.36 times as long, so shorter. But the question is asking how many times longer is P2 than P1. So the answer is 0.36, I think. But looking at the options, option A is ~0.36.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't flip the ratio. Because P2 is shorter, the ratio P2/P1 is 0.36 → so P2 is 0.36 times P1. So the question is how many times longer is P2 than P1? So P2 is about 0.36 times as long as P1. So if P1 is 1 year, P2 is 0.36 years. So P2 is shorter, so it's not longer. So the answer is 0.36 times as long → but that's not longer. Wait, perhaps the question is phrased differently.

Wait the question says: How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?

So if the ratio is P2/P1 = 0.36 → the period of planet 2 is 0.36 times that of planet 1. So planet 2 is shorter, so it's 0.36 times as long. So the answer would be approximately 0.36. Therefore option A is the correct answer.

To determine how many times the orbital period of planet #2 is longer than that of planet #1, we use the relationship between the radial velocity semi-amplitude \( K \) and the orbital period \( P \). The semi-amplitude \( K \) is inversely proportional to \( P^{1/3} \), which can be expressed as:

\[
K \propto \frac{1}{P^{1/3}}
\]

Given that the shifts in the spectral lines are proportional to \( K \), we have:

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \frac{P_2 / P_1}{(P_2 / P_1)^{1/3}}
\]

Simplifying, we find:

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right)^{1/3}
\]

From the problem, \( K_1 = 5 \, \text{milliangstroms} \) and \( K_2 = 7 \, \text{milliangstroms} \), so:

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \frac{5}{7}
\]

Substituting into the equation:

\[
\left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right)^{1/3} = \frac{5}{7}
\]

Cubing both sides:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3 = \frac{125}{343} \approx 0.364
\]

Thus, the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately \( 0.36 \) times the orbital period of planet #1. Since the question asks how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1, the answer is \( 0.36 \).
