Okay, so I've got this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory, SMEFT. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options given are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT symmetries. The choices are combinations of these.

Hmm, I remember that SMEFT is a framework where we write down all possible operators respecting the Standard Model (SM) symmetries, and then add higher-dimensional terms. So, the first thing to figure out is which symmetries the SM has because SMEFT should respect them too.

Wait, the Standard Model is a Lorentz-invariant theory. So any operator in the SMEFT must respect Lorentz symmetry, right? So option 1 is definitely in.

What about Poincare symmetry? Oh wait, Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. The SM is Poincare-invariant. So SMEFT operators should respect Poincare as well. But wait, the SMEFT is a low-energy effective theory. Are all operators automatically Poincare-invariant? Or do we have to include terms that could break it?

Wait, I think in effective theories, the symmetries of the original theory are preserved. Since the SM has Poincare symmetry, SMEFT should too. So both Lorentz and Poincare symmetries are respected. So options 1 and 2 are correct? So both 1 and 2 must be respected. So any correct answer must include both 1 and 2.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is 1 and 2. Option C is 1,2,4. So other options may or may not be right.

Next, what about CP and CPT symmetries? CP is Charge conjugation combined with parity. The SM doesn't have CP symmetry. For example, there are CP-violating terms like the CKM phase. So in SMEFT, do the operators have to respect CP? I don't think so because the SM doesn't. So operators that violate CP could exist as part of the SMEFT.

Wait, but the question is which symmetries must be respected. So if the SM doesn't respect a symmetry, then its effective theory doesn't either. So CP symmetry isn't necessarily respected, so option 3 is not a must.

What about CPT symmetry? I remember that in quantum field theory, all theories that are Lorentz-invariant must respect CPT symmetry. So CPT is a combination of Charge, Parity, and Time reversal. Since SMEFT respects Lorentz symmetry, it must also respect CPT. So option 4 must be respected.

So putting it together: which symmetries are necessarily respected by all operators? Lorentz (1) is in, Poincare (2) is in, CPT (4) is in. CP (3) is not, since the SM doesn't have CP symmetry.

So the symmetries that must be respected are 1, 2, and 4. Looking at the options, option C says 1,2,4. So the correct answer should be option C.

Wait, but wait, does Poincare symmetry include the momentum conservation and translation invariance? Because when you write operators in SMEFT, they are local, so I think they are translation-invariant, hence Poincare is respected. So 1 and 2 are both in.

Yes, so the answer should be option C) 1,2,4.

The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is constructed to respect the symmetries of the Standard Model (SM). The SM is Lorentz-invariant and Poincaré-invariant, meaning all SMEFT operators must respect these symmetries. Lorentz symmetry (1) and Poincaré symmetry (2) are therefore essential and must be preserved by all operators in SMEFT.

CP symmetry (3), on the other hand, is not a symmetry of the SM, as it is violated in processes like the Cabibbo–Kobayashi–Maskawa (CKM) phase. Since SMEFT includes operators that can violate CP, CP symmetry is not a required symmetry for SMEFT operators.

CPT symmetry (4), however, is a fundamental symmetry in quantum field theory. Any Lorentz-invariant theory, including SMEFT, must respect CPT symmetry. Thus, CPT symmetry (4) must also be preserved by all SMEFT operators.

In conclusion, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincaré symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4). Therefore, the correct answer is:

Answer: C
