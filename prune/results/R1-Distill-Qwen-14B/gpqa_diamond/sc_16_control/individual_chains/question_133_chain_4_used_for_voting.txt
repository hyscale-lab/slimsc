Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these kinds of problems. Let's see what it's about. The question is about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution. Hmm, orthophosphate would be PO4^3-, right?

So the solution has a volume of 200.00 cm³, which is 0.2 liters. It contains 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O. The molecular weights are given: 136.09 g/mol for KH2PO4 and 177.99 g/mol for the sodium hydrogen phosphate with two waters. Oh wait, the temperature is 25°C, which is room temperature, so I guess we don't have to worry about any reactions due to temperature changes.

The problem gives the Ka values for H3PO4: Ka1 is 7.5e-3, Ka2 is 6.2e-8, and Ka3 is 1.8e-12. Right, so H3PO4 is a triprotic acid, and it dissociates stepwise.

I remember that when you have a mixture of a weak acid and its conjugate base, it forms a buffer solution. The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation might come into play here. But wait, let's think about what each salt contributes.

KH2PO4 is potassium hydrogen phosphate. I think that when KH2PO4 dissolves in water, it dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^- ions. So H2PO4^- is the dihydrogen phosphate ion, which is the conjugate base of H3PO4 (since it's after the first dissociation) and the conjugate acid of HPO4^2- (after the second dissociation).

Na2HPO4·2H2O is sodium hydrogen phosphate with two waters of crystallization. When it dissolves, it should dissociate into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- ions. So HPO4^2- is the hydrogen phosphate ion, which is the conjugate base of H2PO4^- and the conjugate acid of PO4^3-.

So in the solution, we have H2PO4^- from KH2PO4 and HPO4^2- from Na2HPO4. These two ions can interconvert by the second dissociation of H3PO4, right? Because H2PO4^- can lose a proton to become HPO4^2-, which is the second dissociation step, governed by Ka2.

That means the solution is a buffer solution between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, and the pH should be determined by the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation using pKa2.

Wait, but the question is asking about the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which is PO4^3-. Hmm, so PO4^3- is the conjugate base of HPO4^2-. To find [PO4^3-], I need to think about how much HPO4^2- donates a proton. But under normal circumstances, at pH around neutral, the concentration of PO4^3- is going to be really low because Ka3 is 1.8e-12, which is super small. So the hydrolysis of HPO4^2- to PO4^3- is minimal.

But let me not get ahead of myself. Let me outline the steps:

1. Calculate the moles of each salt.
2. Determine the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- in the solution.
3. Use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH of the solution, which will help us find the pH.
4. Then, use the third dissociation (Ka3) to find [PO4^3-].

Wait, but maybe I can approach it another way. Since the solution is a buffer between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, which are in a 1:1 ratio based on the moles of each salt, the pH would be around pKa2. Let me think.

Wait, no, the amounts might not be the same. Let me calculate the moles.

First, moles of KH2PO4: mass / Mw = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol. Let me compute that.

1.00 / 136.09 ≈ 0.007336 mol. So about 0.007336 moles of H2PO4^-.

Similarly, moles of Na2HPO4·2H2O: 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol. Let's do that: 1.00 / 177.99 ≈ 0.005607 mol. So 0.005607 moles of HPO4^2-.

Wait, but the solution volume is 0.2 liters. So the concentrations are:

[H2PO4^-] = 0.007336 / 0.2 = 0.03668 M.

[HPO4^2-] = 0.005607 / 0.2 = 0.028035 M.

So now, the buffer is between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, so using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-])

pKa2 is the second dissociation, which is 6.2e-8, so pKa2 is log(1/(6.2e-8)) = -log(6.2e-8) ≈ 7.208.

So pH = 7.208 + log( (0.028035)/(0.03668) )

Let's compute the ratio: 0.028035 / 0.03668 ≈ 0.7648.

Log(0.7648) is approximately -0.116.

So pH ≈ 7.208 - 0.116 ≈ 7.092.

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me check the calculation again.

Wait, no, wait: Henderson-Hasselbalch is pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]). In this case, the base is HPO4^2- and the acid is H2PO4^-? No, wait, H2PO4^- is the acid (since it can donate a proton to become HPO4^2-). So the base is HPO4^2-.

So yes, pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-]).

So yeah, as I did before, the ratio is ~0.7648, so log(0.7648) is about -0.116.

So pH is approximately 7.092.

But wait, the problem is asking for the concentration of PO4^3-.

PO4^3- comes from the deprotonation of HPO4^2-: HPO4^2- ↔ H+ + PO4^3-.

The Ka for this reaction is Ka3, which is 1.8e-12. So the pH is around 7.09, which is slightly basic. Let's think about the concentration.

The expression for Ka3 is [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-] = 1.8e-12.

We can rearrange this to find [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+}

We have Ka3, [HPO4^2-], and [H+] can be found from pH.

Because pH is 7.09, so [H+] = 1e-7.09 ≈ 8.21e-8 M.

So [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12) * (0.028035) / (8.21e-8)

Let me compute that:

Numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.028035 ≈ 5.0463e-14

Denominator: 8.21e-8

So 5.0463e-14 / 8.21e-8 ≈ (5.0463 / 8.21 ) * 1e-6

5.0463 /8.21 ≈ 0.6145

So 0.6145e-6 M → 6.145e-7 M.

Wait, that's 6.145e-7 M, which is around 6.15e-7.

Looking at the options:

Option A is 6.24e-7, which is close.

Option D is 3.97e-7. Hmm, why the discrepancy?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recheck each step.

First, moles of KH2PO4: 1.00g /136.09 g/mol.

136.09 is approximately 136.1. 1 /136.1 ≈ 0.007336 mol. That's correct.

Moles of Na2HPO4·2H2O: 1.00 /177.99 ≈ 0.005607 mol. Correct.

Concentration H2PO4^-: 0.007336 / 0.2 = 0.03668 M. Correct.

Concentration HPO4^2-: 0.005607 /0.2 = 0.028035 M. Correct.

Henderson equation: pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-})

pKa2 is -log(6.2e-8) → Let's compute that accurately.

log(6.2) is about 0.7924, so 6.2e-8 is 6.2 * 1e-8, so log(6.2e-8) is log(6.2) + log(1e-8) = 0.7924 -8 = -7.2076. So pKa2 is 7.2076.

The ratio [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] is 0.028035 /0.03668 ≈ 0.7648.

log(0.7648) → Let me compute this more precisely. 

Log(0.7) is about -0.1549, log(0.76) is about -0.117, log(0.7648) → let me compute:

We know that log(0.7648) = log(7.648e-1). Let me compute log(7.648) = approx 0.884, so log(0.7648) = 0.884 -1 = -0.116. So yes, about -0.116.

So pH = 7.2076 - 0.116 ≈7.0916.

So [H+] = 10^(-7.0916) → let me compute that accurately.

10^(-7.0916) = 10^(-7 -0.0916) = 1e-7 * 10^(-0.0916).

What's 10^(-0.0916)? Let's think: since 10^(-0.07918) is 0.8 (because log10(0.8)= -0.09691?), wait no, wait:

Wait, sorry, 10^(-0.0916) is approximately 10^(-0.1) ≈ 0.7943, but more accurately:

We can compute it as 10^(-0.09) ≈ 0.8123, and 10^(-0.0916) is slightly less.

Difference: let's take a Taylor expansion or use a calculator approach.

Alternatively, use natural logs. Let me think.

But maybe it's easier to compute as follows:

ln(10^x) = x ln(10), so 10^x = e^(x ln 10).

x = -0.0916 → x ln(10) ≈ -0.0916 * 2.302585 ≈ -0.2108.

e^(-0.2108) ≈ 1 -0.2108 + 0.2108^2/2 - ... ≈ 0.811.

Wait, but wait, e^(-0.2108) is approximately 0.809? Hmm, perhaps I should just use a calculator approach.

Alternatively, 10^(-0.0916) = 1/(10^0.0916).

Calculate 10^0.0916:

We know that 10^0.07918 ≈ 1.2 (since log10(1.2)=0.07918), but 0.0916 is higher.

Let me compute 10^0.09:

Since 10^0.09 = approx 1.23 (wait, let me think: 10^0.07918=1.2, 10^0.1≈1.2589.

So for 0.09, it's between 1.2 and 1.2589.

Let me compute 10^0.09:

Take natural logs: ln(10^0.09)=0.09 * ln(10)=0.09*2.302585≈0.2072325.

e^0.2072325 ≈ 1 + 0.2072 + 0.2072^2/2 + 0.2072^3/6.

0.2072^2 = ~0.0429, so 0.0429/2=0.02145.

0.2072^3 = 0.2072 * 0.0429 ≈ 0.00886, /6 ≈ 0.001477.

So sum: 1 + 0.2072 = 1.2072 + 0.02145=1.22865 + 0.001477=1.2301.

So 10^0.09 ≈1.2301.

So 10^0.0916 is a bit higher. Let's compute 0.0016 above 0.09.

The derivative of 10^x at x=0.09 is ln(10)*10^0.09 ≈2.302585 *1.2301≈2.8305.

So for an increase of 0.0016 in x, the increase in 10^x is approximately 2.8305 *0.0016 ≈0.00453.

So 10^0.0916 ≈1.2301 +0.00453=1.2346.

So 10^(-0.0916)=1/1.2346≈0.810.

So [H+] = 1e-7 * 0.810 ≈8.10e-8 M.

Wait, earlier I approximated 8.21e-8, but this more precise calculation gives 8.10e-8. Close enough.

Now, [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+]

Ka3 is 1.8e-12.

[HPO4^2-] is 0.028035 M.

[H+] is 8.10e-8.

So:

(1.8e-12) * 0.028035 = 5.0463e-14.

Divide by 8.10e-8 → 5.0463e-14 /8.10e-8 = (5.0463 /8.10) * 1e-6 ≈0.623 *1e-6 →6.23e-7 M.

Which is about 6.23e-7 M. So option A is 6.24e-7 M, which is very close. So that's the answer.

Wait, but wait a second. Are we considering all possible sources of PO4^3-? Because the buffer solution is based on H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, but could there be any precipitation or other reactions affecting the concentration?

I think in this case, the solution is well within the buffer range, so PO4^3- is negligible except what comes from the third dissociation. So my calculation should be correct.

Therefore, the concentration is approximately 6.23e-7 M, so the correct answer is option A.

To determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO₄³⁻) in the solution, we analyze the given data and proceed as follows:

### Step 1: Calculate moles of each salt
The solution contains 1.00 g of KH₂PO₄ and 1.00 g of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O. Using their molecular weights (136.09 g/mol and 177.99 g/mol, respectively), the moles are calculated as:

- Moles of KH₂PO₄ = \( \frac{1.00}{136.09} \approx 0.007336 \, \text{mol} \)
- Moles of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O = \( \frac{1.00}{177.99} \approx 0.005607 \, \text{mol} \)

### Step 2: Calculate concentrations of H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻
The solution volume is 200.00 cm³ = 0.2 L. The concentrations of the ions are:

- \([H₂PO₄⁻] = \frac{0.007336}{0.2} \approx 0.03668 \, \text{M}\)
- \([HPO₄²⁻] = \frac{0.005607}{0.2} \approx 0.028035 \, \text{M}\)

### Step 3: Use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH
The solution is a buffer between H₂PO₄⁻ (acid) and HPO₄²⁻ (base), governed by the second dissociation constant of H₃PO₄ (\(K_a2 = 6.2 \times 10^{-8}\)). The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{p}K_a2 + \log \left( \frac{[HPO₄²⁻]}{[H₂PO₄⁻]} \right)
\]

- \(\text{p}K_a2 = -\log(6.2 \times 10^{-8}) \approx 7.208\)
- \(\frac{[HPO₄²⁻]}{[H₂PO₄⁻]} = \frac{0.028035}{0.03668} \approx 0.7648\)
- \(\log(0.7648) \approx -0.116\)

Thus:

\[
\text{pH} = 7.208 - 0.116 \approx 7.092
\]

### Step 4: Calculate \([PO₄³⁻]\) using \(K_a3\)
The third dissociation of H₃PO₄ is:

\[
HPO₄²⁻ \leftrightarrow H⁺ + PO₄³⁻
\]

The expression for \(K_a3\) is:

\[
K_a3 = \frac{[H⁺][PO₄³⁻]}{[HPO₄²⁻]}
\]

Rearranging for \([PO₄³⁻]\):

\[
[PO₄³⁻] = \frac{K_a3 \cdot [HPO₄²⁻]}{[H⁺]}
\]

From the pH, \([H⁺] = 10^{-\text{pH}} = 10^{-7.092} \approx 8.10 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{M}\). Substituting the values:

\[
[PO₄³⁻] = \frac{(1.8 \times 10^{-12}) \cdot (0.028035)}{8.10 \times 10^{-8}}
\]

- Numerator: \(1.8 \times 10^{-12} \cdot 0.028035 \approx 5.0463 \times 10^{-14}\)
- Denominator: \(8.10 \times 10^{-8}\)

\[
[PO₄³⁻] = \frac{5.0463 \times 10^{-14}}{8.10 \times 10^{-8}} \approx 6.23 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

### Final Answer:
The concentration of orthophosphate ions is approximately \(6.23 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}\), which corresponds to **Option A**.
