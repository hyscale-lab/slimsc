Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll give it a shot.

The question says that we start with 20.00 cm³ (which is 20 mL) of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. So the total volume after dilution would be 40 mL, right? Because 20 + 20 is 40. Oh wait, when you mix solutions, the volumes add up, so yeah, 40 mL total.

Wait, what's the concentration of acetic acid after dilution? I remember that M1V1 = M2V2. So the initial moles of acetic acid are M1 * V1. M1 is 0.05 M, V1 is 0.02 L (since 20 mL is 0.02 liters). So moles = 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 moles. After adding 20 mL of water, the volume is 40 mL or 0.04 L. So the new concentration is moles divided by volume, which is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Next, we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH. The question asks for the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. So I need to find two pH values.

First, let me tackle the equivalence point. At equivalence, all the acetic acid will have reacted with NaOH. So the moles of NaOH added will equal the moles of acetic acid present.

Wait, the initial moles of acetic acid are 0.001? Let me confirm. 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 moles. So NaOH needs to provide 0.001 moles to reach equivalence.

The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M. So volume (V) = moles / concentration. So V = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 mL. So to reach equivalence, you add 10 mL of NaOH.

But wait, the question is about when 25% of the acetic acid is titrated. So 25% of 0.001 moles is 0.00025 moles of NaOH added. Let me calculate the volume of NaOH needed for that.

Volume V = 0.00025 / 0.1 M = 0.0025 L, which is 2.5 mL. So at 25% titration, we've added 2.5 mL of NaOH.

But wait, the way the question is phrased is a bit ambiguous. It says "25% titration" — does that mean 25% of the acetic acid has reacted, or 25% of the equivalence volume has been added? I think it's the former: 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized.

So back to the two scenarios: 25% titration and equivalence point.

Let's start with the equivalence point. At equivalence, all the acetic acid has been converted to acetate ions. The solution will consist of sodium acetate in water. Sodium acetate is a salt that comes from a weak acid (acetic acid) and a strong base (NaOH), so the solution will be basic.

The concentration of sodium acetate can be found by considering the dilution. After adding 10 mL of NaOH (0.1 M) to the 40 mL diluted acetic acid solution, the total volume is 40 + 10 = 50 mL (0.05 L).

The moles of sodium acetate are 0.001 moles (same as acetic acid initially). So concentration is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

The acetate ion (A-) will hydrolyze in water:

A- + H2O ↔ HA + OH-

The Kb for acetate can be found from Ka of acetic acid. Since Ka * Kb = Kw (1e-14 at 25°C). So Kb = Kw / Ka = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) ≈ 5.405e-10.

So the Kb is about 5.405e-10. The concentration of A- is 0.02 M.

The pH can be calculated using the formula for a weak base:

pH = pKa + pKw/2 - ½ log C ?

Wait, no. Let's think. The hydrolysis reaction is A- + H2O → HA + OH-. So Kb = [HA][OH-]/[A-]

Assuming x is the concentration of OH- produced, we can approximate because Kb is very small.

So Kb ≈ x² / (0.02 - x). Since Kb is 5.4e-10, x will be much smaller than 0.02, so x² ≈ Kb * 0.02.

x² = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11 → x ≈ sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 3.288e-6 M.

So [OH-] is approximately 3.288e-6 M. pOH is -log(3.288e-6) ≈ 5.485. So pH is 14 - 5.485 ≈ 8.515. That's about 8.52. But wait, the options don't have that. Wait, let me check the calculation again.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the pH using the exact formula. Let's write the expression:

Kb = [HA][OH-]/( [A-] )

Let the initial concentration of A- be 0.02 M. Let x be the amount that hydrolyzes. So:

Kb = (x)(x)/(0.02 - x) → 5.405e-10 = x²/(0.02 - x)

Assuming x is really small compared to 0.02, we can approximate 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

So x² ≈ 5.405e-10 * 0.02 → x ≈ sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 3.288e-6. So [OH-] ≈ 3.288e-6, pOH is about 5.48. pH is 8.52.

Looking at the options, option A has 8.52 as the second value. But wait, I thought the equivalence point would be around pH 8.52. Let me see the options:

Option A: 4.26; 8.52

Option D: 4.57;6.92

But wait, some sources say that for a weak acid titrated with a strong base, the equivalence point is around pH 8.5, which would match this calculation.

But let's proceed to the 25% titration.

At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized. So we've added 2.5 mL of NaOH (0.1 M). Let's find the moles of NaOH added: 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 moles.

The initial moles of acetic acid after dilution were 0.001 moles. So, 0.00025 moles of OH- have reacted with 0.00025 moles of acetic acid, producing 0.00025 moles of acetate.

So, the moles of acetic acid remaining are 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 moles.

The moles of acetate ions formed are 0.00025 moles.

The total volume of the solution is the original 40 mL plus 2.5 mL of NaOH, which is 42.5 mL or 0.0425 L.

So the concentrations are:

[Acid] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M.

[Acetate] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

This is a buffer solution, so we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

pH = pKa + log( [A-]/[HA] )

The pKa is given by -log(1.85e-5). Let me compute that:

1.85e-5 is 0.0000185.

log(1.85) is approx 0.267, so pKa is about 4.735 - 0.267 = wait, no. Wait, pKa is -log(1.85e-5). Let's compute it accurately.

log(1.85) ≈ 0.267. So log(1.85e-5) is 0.267 -5 = -4.733. So pKa is 4.733.

So pH = 4.733 + log( (0.005882) / (0.017647) )

Compute the ratio: 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.3333.

log(0.3333) is log(1/3) ≈ -0.4771.

So pH = 4.733 - 0.4771 ≈ 4.256.

Which is approximately 4.26.

So at 25% titration, pH is about 4.26, and at equivalence point, pH is about 8.52. So the pair is 4.26; 8.52. Looking at the options, that's option A.

Wait, but wait a minute. I thought that for a weak acid titration, the pH at 25% would be a bit below 4.73, which is the pKa. So 4.26 makes sense because it's before the equivalence point and the buffer is more towards the acid side.

Wait, but let me double-check the Henderson-Hasselbalch calculation. The ratio is [A-]/[HA] = (0.00025)/(0.00075) )= 1/3. So yes, log(1/3)= -0.477. So 4.733 -0.477 is about 4.256.

But wait, perhaps I should compute the [H+] more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the dilution correctly.

Wait, after adding 2.5 mL of NaOH to the 40 mL of diluted acetic acid, the total volume is 42.5 mL, which is 0.0425 L.

Moles of acetic acid: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075.

Moles of acetate: 0.00025.

So concentrations:

[HA] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M.

[A-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

So yes, ratio is 0.005882 /0.017647 = 0.333.

So pH is pKa + log(0.333) ~ 4.733 -0.477 =4.256, which rounds to 4.26.

So the two pH values are approximately 4.26 and 8.52. So the correct option is A.

Wait, but looking at the options. Option A is 4.26; 8.52. That's what I have.

But wait, let me think again about the equivalence point. When all the acetic acid is neutralized, the solution is sodium acetate. The concentration is 0.02 M as I had earlier. So acetate ion is 0.02 M.

But wait, I think I made a mistake in the Kb calculation. Let me redo that.

Ka of acetic acid is 1.85e-5. So Kb of acetate is Kw / Ka = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) = approx 5.405e-10.

So for the hydrolysis:

A- + H2O ↔ HA + OH-

Initial concentration: 0.02 M A-, 0 HA, 0 OH-.

Change: -x, +x, +x.

So at equilibrium, [A-] = 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02, [HA]=x, [OH-]=x.

Kb = x² / (0.02) =5.405e-10 → x² = 5.405e-10 *0.02=1.081e-11 → x= sqrt(1.081e-11)= approx 3.288e-6 M.

So [OH-] is 3.288e-6. pOH is log(3.288e-6) → log(3.288)=0.516, so log(3.288e-6)=0.516 -6= -5.484. So pOH is 5.484, pH is 14-5.484=8.516, which rounds to 8.52.

So that part is correct.

But wait, some sources say that the pH at equivalence depends on activity coefficients, but for a problem like this, we can assume ideal behavior.

So with both pH values being 4.26 and 8.52, the correct option is A.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is the first one. So the answer should be A.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial dilution. Let me recheck that.

Initial volume is 20 mL of 0.05 M acetic acid. So moles are 0.05 * 0.02 =0.001 moles.

After adding 20 mL water, total volume is 40 mL. So concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 =0.025 M. Correct.

So when we titrate with 0.1 M NaOH.

At 25% titration: 25% of 0.001 moles is 0.00025 moles. So volume is 0.00025 / 0.1 =0.0025 L=2.5 mL. So correct.

So the buffer calculation is correct, leading to pH ~4.26.

So the option A is correct.

To solve the problem, we start by determining the concentration of acetic acid after dilution. Initially, we have 20.00 cm³ (0.02 L) of 0.05 M acetic acid, which contains:

\[
\text{Moles of acetic acid} = 0.05 \, \text{M} \times 0.02 \, \text{L} = 0.001 \, \text{moles}.
\]

After adding 20.00 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40.00 cm³ (0.04 L). The new concentration of acetic acid is:

\[
\text{Concentration} = \frac{\text{Moles}}{\text{Volume}} = \frac{0.001}{0.04} = 0.025 \, \text{M}.
\]

### At the Equivalence Point
At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH, forming sodium acetate. The moles of NaOH required to reach the equivalence point are equal to the moles of acetic acid:

\[
\text{Moles of NaOH} = 0.001 \, \text{moles}.
\]

The volume of 0.1 M NaOH required is:

\[
\text{Volume} = \frac{\text{Moles}}{\text{Concentration}} = \frac{0.001}{0.1} = 0.01 \, \text{L} = 10 \, \text{mL}.
\]

After adding 10 mL of NaOH to the 40 mL of diluted acetic acid, the total volume is:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40 \, \text{mL} + 10 \, \text{mL} = 50 \, \text{mL} = 0.05 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentration of sodium acetate is:

\[
\text{Concentration of sodium acetate} = \frac{\text{Moles}}{\text{Volume}} = \frac{0.001}{0.05} = 0.02 \, \text{M}.
\]

Sodium acetate is a salt of a weak acid (acetic acid) and a strong base (NaOH), so the solution is basic. The pH is determined by the hydrolysis of acetate ions:

\[
\text{Acetate ion (A⁻)} + \text{H₂O} \leftrightarrow \text{HA} + \text{OH⁻}.
\]

The equilibrium constant for this reaction is the base dissociation constant \(K_b\), which is related to the acid dissociation constant \(K_a\) of acetic acid:

\[
K_b = \frac{K_w}{K_a} = \frac{1 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.405 \times 10^{-10}.
\]

Using the approximation for weak bases, where \(K_b \ll 1\), the concentration of \(\text{OH⁻}\) is:

\[
[\text{OH⁻}] = \sqrt{K_b \cdot [\text{A⁻}]} = \sqrt{(5.405 \times 10^{-10}) \cdot (0.02)} \approx 3.288 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{M}.
\]

The pOH is:

\[
\text{pOH} = -\log{[\text{OH⁻}]} = -\log{(3.288 \times 10^{-6})} \approx 5.48.
\]

The pH is:

\[
\text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 5.48 \approx 8.52.
\]

### At 25% Titration
At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH. The moles of NaOH added are:

\[
\text{Moles of NaOH} = 0.25 \times 0.001 = 0.00025 \, \text{moles}.
\]

The total volume of the solution is:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40 \, \text{mL} + 2.5 \, \text{mL} = 42.5 \, \text{mL} = 0.0425 \, \text{L}.
\]

The remaining moles of acetic acid are:

\[
\text{Moles of HA} = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 \, \text{moles}.
\]

The moles of acetate ions formed are:

\[
\text{Moles of A⁻} = 0.00025 \, \text{moles}.
\]

The concentrations are:

\[
[\text{HA}] = \frac{0.00075}{0.0425} \approx 0.01765 \, \text{M}, \quad [\text{A⁻}] = \frac{0.00025}{0.0425} \approx 0.00588 \, \text{M}.
\]

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{pKa} + \log{\frac{[\text{A⁻}]}{[\text{HA}]}}.
\]

The \(K_a\) of acetic acid is \(1.85 \times 10^{-5}\), so:

\[
\text{pKa} = -\log{(1.85 \times 10^{-5})} \approx 4.73.
\]

Substituting the concentrations:

\[
\text{pH} = 4.73 + \log{\frac{0.00588}{0.01765}} = 4.73 + \log{(0.333)}.
\]

\[
\log{(0.333)} \approx -0.477, \quad \text{so} \quad \text{pH} = 4.73 - 0.477 \approx 4.26.
\]

### Final Answer
At 25% titration, the pH is approximately 4.26, and at the equivalence point, the pH is approximately 8.52. The correct option is:

**Answer: A**
