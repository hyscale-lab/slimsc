Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of coordination complexes and stability constants. Let me try to think it through step by step.

The problem says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate ions. The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. We're supposed to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species.

Hmm, okay. So first, I remember that stability constants (formation constants) indicate how stable a complex is. The higher the β, the more the complex will form. So β4 is 16, which is lower than β3 (63), so the Co(SCN)_3^+ complex is more stable than Co(SCN)_4^2- perhaps? Wait, but I'm not sure about the stoichiometry here. Oh wait, in this case, the complexes are probably [Co(SCN)_n]^m+ where n ranges from 1 to 4. So the first complex is [CoSCN]^2+, second [Co(SCN)2]^+, third [Co(SCN)3]^0 (maybe?), and the fourth [Co(SCN)4]^2-.

Wait, but I think the stability constant is defined as the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. So for each complex, βn is the equilibrium constant for Co^2+ + n SCN^- ↔ [Co(SCN)_n]^{2-n}.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think: the general formation of [Co(SCN)_n]^{2−n} would be Co^2+ + n SCN^- → [Co(SCN)_n]^{2−n}. The stability constant βn is equal to [ [Co(SCN)_n]^{2−n} ] / ( [Co^2+][SCN^-]^n ). So higher βn implies the complex is more favored.

So given β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So the third complex is the most stable, followed by the second, then first, and the fourth is less stable than the first.

The question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex. Dithiocyanato would mean two SCN^- ligands. So that's the [Co(SCN)2]^+ complex, which corresponds to β2=40.

Wait, but wait. The question refers to the percentage of blue dithiocyanato complexes. I'm a bit fuzzy on the colors, but I think the [Co(SCN)2]^+ is blue, [Co(SCN)3]^0 is green or something, but maybe [Co(SCN)4]^2- is another color. But regardless, the question is about the percentage of the dithiocyanato (n=2) complex.

So the task is to find the fraction of Co in the [Co(SCN)2]^+ complex relative to all possible Co species.

Now, the total Co concentration is given as 1e-2 M, which includes all the species: [Co^2+], [CoSCN]^2+, [Co(SCN)2]^+, [Co(SCN)3]^0, [Co(SCN)4]^2-.

So the sum of all these concentrations should equal 1e-2 M. But since the formation of complexes depends on the stability constants, we can model the distribution of Co among these complexes.

I remember that for such a problem, the fraction of each complex depends on the β values and the concentrations of the ligand. The ligand here is SCN^- at 0.1 M.

The approach is to calculate the fraction of each complex using the β values and the ligand concentration.

The general formula for the fraction f_n of the nth complex is:

f_n = (β_n [SCN^-]^n) / ( 1 + β1 [SCN^-] + β2 [SCN^-]^2 + β3 [SCN^-]^3 + β4 [SCN^-]^4 )

Wait, not exactly. Because each βn is the formation constant for the nth complex. So the fraction of the nth complex is given by:

f_n = (βn [SCN^-]^n) / (sum over k=0 to 4 of βk [SCN^-]^k )

Wait, but wait. Let me think about that. The fraction f_n is the concentration of the nth complex divided by the total concentration of all Co species.

So [Co(SCN)_n] = βn [Co^2+][SCN^-]^n. But because [Co^2+] is the free ion, which is part of the total Co concentration, the denominator will involve all the βk terms multiplied by [SCN^-]^k.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to use the expression for each species in terms of free Co^2+.

Let me denote [Co^2+] as x. Then:

[Co] = x + [CoSCN] + [Co(SCN)2] + [Co(SCN)3] + [Co(SCN)4]

But because the total Co concentration is c = 1e-2 M, this sum equals c. So:

x + β1 x [SCN]^1 + β2 x [SCN]^2 + β3 x [SCN]^3 + β4 x [SCN]^4 = c

But that's a bit complicated. Alternatively, I've heard of the "formation of complexes" in terms of conditional formation constants, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps using the distribution of Co among the complexes based on the ligand concentration and the β values.

Wait, another approach is to consider that the fraction of each complex is proportional to (βn * [SCN]^n).

So the fraction f_n is (βn [SCN]^n) / sum_{k=0 to 4} βk [SCN]^k )

Wait, but the sum would start at k=0? Because n ranges from 1 to 4, but for n=0, it's just Co^2+.

Wait, but the β0 would be 1, since it's the free ion. So the denominator would be 1 + β1 [SCN] + β2 [SCN]^2 + β3 [SCN]^3 + β4 [SCN]^4.

Yes, that makes sense. So the fraction for each complex is:

f_n = (βn [SCN]^n) / (1 + β1 [SCN] + β2 [SCN]^2 + β3 [SCN]^3 + β4 [SCN]^4 )

But wait, no. Because the βn are the formation constants, which are [complex]/( [Co][SCN]^n ). So each complex's concentration is [Co] * βn [SCN]^n. So the sum of all these plus [Co] must equal the total Co concentration.

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled. Let me try to model it properly.

Let’s denote:

[Co^2+] = x

[CoSCN]^2+ = x * β1 * [SCN^-] = x * 9 * 0.1

[Co(SCN)2]^+ = x * β2 * [SCN^-]^2 = x *40*(0.1)^2

[Co(SCN)3]^0 = x * β3 * [SCN^-]^3 = x *63*(0.1)^3

[Co(SCN)4]^2- = x * β4 * [SCN^-]^4 = x *16*(0.1)^4

The total Co concentration is:

x + [CoSCN] + [Co(SCN)2] + [Co(SCN)3] + [Co(SCN)4] = c = 1e-2 M

So substituting:

x + x*9*0.1 + x*40*(0.1)^2 + x*63*(0.1)^3 + x*16*(0.1)^4 = 1e-2

Factor x:

x [1 + 0.9 + 40*0.01 + 63*0.001 + 16*0.0001 ] = 1e-2

Compute each term inside the brackets:

1 = 1

0.9 = 0.9

40 * 0.01 = 0.4

63 * 0.001 = 0.063

16 * 0.0001 = 0.0016

Adding them up:

1 + 0.9 = 1.9

1.9 + 0.4 = 2.3

2.3 + 0.063 = 2.363

2.363 + 0.0016 = 2.3646

So,

x * 2.3646 = 1e-2 → x = 1e-2 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.004224 M

So [Co^2+] is approximately 0.004224 M.

Now, let's compute each complex's concentration.

[CoSCN] = x * β1 * [SCN] = 0.004224 * 9 * 0.1

= 0.004224 * 0.9 = 0.0038016 M

[Co(SCN)2] = x * β2 * (0.1)^2 = 0.004224 *40 * 0.01

= 0.004224 * 0.4 = 0.0016896 M

[Co(SCN)3] = x * β3 * (0.1)^3 = 0.004224 *63 * 0.001

= 0.004224 * 0.063 = approx 0.000266 M

[Co(SCN)4] = x * β4 * (0.1)^4 = 0.004224 *16 * 0.0001

= 0.004224 * 0.0016 = 0.0000067584 M

Now, let's compute each concentration and their percentages.

Total Co is 1e-2 M.

So the fraction for each complex is:

f1 = [CoSCN] / c = (0.0038016) / (0.01) = 0.38016 → 38.016%

f2 = [Co(SCN)2] / c = 0.0016896 / 0.01 = 0.16896 → 16.896%

f3 = 0.000266 / 0.01 = 0.0266 → 2.66%

f4 = 0.0000067584 / 0.01 = 0.00067584 → 0.067584%

And f0, the fraction of free Co^2+ is x / c = 0.004224 / 0.01 = 0.4224 → 42.24%

Wait a minute, but the sum of all fractions should be 100%:

42.24% (free) + 38.02% ([CoSCN]) + 16.9% ([Co(SCN)2]) + 2.66% + 0.0675% ≈ 100% 

Wait, let me sum them up:

42.24 + 38.016 = 80.256 

80.256 + 16.896 = 97.152 

97.152 +2.66 = 99.812 

+0.067584 ≈ 99.88%, so about 99.88%, which is close to 100%, considering rounding errors.

So the problem is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex, which is [Co(SCN)2]^+, which is f2=16.896%.

Wait, but looking back at the options, option D is 16.9%, which would be this. But wait, the question asks for the percentage of blue dithiocyanato complexes. Let me check if I got the complexes right.

Wait, dithiocyanato would be two SCN groups. So that's [Co(SCN)2]^+. So that's the second complex, which I calculated as f2=16.896%, which rounds to 16.9%, which is option D.

But wait, looking back at the β values: β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So the most stable is β3=63, which is the third complex. But the question is about the second, which is 40.

Wait, but according to the calculation, the second complex is the dithiocyanato and the fraction is about 16.9%, which is option D.

But wait, looking at the options, option D is 16.9%, which would match.

Wait, but looking at the options again, the options are:

A) 42.3% 

B)25.6% 

C)38.1% 

D)16.9%

Hmm, so according to the calculation, the answer should be D.

Wait, but wait a second. Wait, wait, in the calculation, [Co(SCN)2] is 0.0016896 M. So 0.0016896 / 0.01 is 0.16896, which is 16.896%. So yes, that's 16.9%, option D.

Wait, but wait. The problem says "blue dithiocyanato". I'm recalling that [Co(SCN)2]^+ is blue, but sometimes in some cases, higher SCN complexes are blue. But perhaps the problem is correct. So according to the calculation, the answer is D.

But wait, I think I might have made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check the numbers.

Wait, [Co(SCN)2] is x * β2 * (0.1)^2.

x is 0.004224 M.

So 0.004224 * 40 = 0.16896, multiplied by (0.1)^2 = 0.01.

Wait, 0.16896 * 0.01 is 0.0016896. Correct.

So f2 is 0.0016896 / 0.01 = 0.16896, 16.896%.

Looks correct.

So the answer must be option D, 16.9%.

To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex ([Co(SCN)₂]⁺) among all cobalt-containing species, we analyze the distribution of cobalt species in the solution. The total cobalt concentration is given as \( c(\text{Co}) = 10^{-2} \, \text{M} \), and the thiocyanate concentration is \( [\text{SCN}^-] = 0.1 \, \text{M} \). The stability constants for the complexes are \( \beta_1 = 9 \), \( \beta_2 = 40 \), \( \beta_3 = 63 \), and \( \beta_4 = 16 \).

The fraction of each cobalt species is proportional to \( \beta_n [\text{SCN}^-]^n \), normalized by the sum of all such terms for \( n = 0 \) to \( 4 \). The total cobalt concentration is distributed among the following species:

- Free cobalt ion: \( \text{Co}^{2+} \)
- Monothiocyanato complex: \( [\text{CoSCN}]^{2+} \)
- Dithiocyanato complex: \( [\text{Co(SCN)}_2]^+ \)
- Trithiocyanato complex: \( [\text{Co(SCN)}_3]^0 \)
- Tetathiocyanato complex: \( [\text{Co(SCN)}_4]^{2-} \)

The fraction of the dithiocyanato complex ([Co(SCN)₂]⁺) is calculated as:

\[
f_2 = \frac{\beta_2 [\text{SCN}^-]^2}{1 + \beta_1 [\text{SCN}^-] + \beta_2 [\text{SCN}^-]^2 + \beta_3 [\text{SCN}^-]^3 + \beta_4 [\text{SCN}^-]^4}
\]

Substituting the given values:
- \( \beta_1 = 9 \), \( \beta_2 = 40 \), \( \beta_3 = 63 \), \( \beta_4 = 16 \)
- \( [\text{SCN}^-] = 0.1 \, \text{M} \)

First, calculate the denominator:
\[
1 + \beta_1 [\text{SCN}^-] + \beta_2 [\text{SCN}^-]^2 + \beta_3 [\text{SCN}^-]^3 + \beta_4 [\text{SCN}^-]^4
\]
\[
= 1 + 9(0.1) + 40(0.1)^2 + 63(0.1)^3 + 16(0.1)^4
\]
\[
= 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646
\]

Next, calculate the numerator for \( f_2 \):
\[
\beta_2 [\text{SCN}^-]^2 = 40(0.1)^2 = 40(0.01) = 0.4
\]

Thus:
\[
f_2 = \frac{0.4}{2.3646} \approx 0.16896 \, \text{or} \, 16.896\%
\]

Rounding to one decimal place, the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex is \( 16.9\% \).

From the given options:
- A) 42.3%
- B) 25.6%
- C) 38.1%
- D) 16.9%

The correct answer is **D) 16.9%**.
