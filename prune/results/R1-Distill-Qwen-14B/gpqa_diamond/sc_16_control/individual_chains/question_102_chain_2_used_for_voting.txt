Okay, so I'm trying to figure out why the green signal isn't showing up in the mice after this experiment. Let's go through the problem step by step.

So, the setup involves a ligand-receptor pair expressed in neural crest cells. They're using a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. Hmm, bicistronic means it has two ORFs in one vector, right? So the vector has two coding regions, for the ligand and the receptor.

The ligand's ORF is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry. Wait, no, the ligand's ORF is at 5' and fused to mCherry? Or is the mCherry a separate thing? Oh, wait, the stop cassette is between the ligand ORF and mCherry. Oh, right, so the ligand is first, then a stop cassette with loxP, then maybe a mCherry? Or maybe the ligand is fused to mCherry? Hmm, not sure, but I think the ligand is under its own promoter and then mCherry is another reporter.

Wait, the ligand is under the CBA promoter, which is a strong promoter. Upstream of the receptor is the IRES element. Oh, right, in bicistronic vectors, the IRES allows for internal ribosome entry, so the second gene can be expressed without a second promoter. So the ligand is under CBA, and the receptor is under an IRES after the ligand.

Wait, the vector is a lox-Cre construct. So the idea is that Cre will excise certain regions. Let's see: between ligand ORF and mCherry is a loxP-stop-loxP cassette. So I think that means that the ligand is before the stop cassette, which is before mCherry. So normally, without Cre, the stop cassette would prevent expression of mCherry, because the ligand's ORF is terminated. But when Cre is present, it would excise the loxP-stop-loxP, allowing the ligand to be expressed and then mCherry to be expressed as a fusion or in the same transcript?

Wait, no, maybe the stop cassette is a transcriptional stop, meaning that without Cre, the ligand is expressed, but after that, the stop would prevent mCherry from being expressed. But when Cre is present, it would remove the stop, allowing mCherry to be expressed in the same transcript as the ligand? Or maybe the ligand and mCherry are co-expressed? I'm a bit confused here.

Similarly, the receptor ORF is at the 3' end, fused to eGFP, but between the receptor and eGFP is a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette. So the same idea: without Cre, the receptor is expressed, but the stop cassette prevents eGFP from being expressed. When Cre is present, it would excise that stop, allowing eGFP to be expressed along with the receptor.

Wait, but in the case of the ligand, it's CBA driven. The ligand and mCherry are in the same transcript? Or maybe the ligand's ORF is followed by a stop, and then mCherry, but the stop is under a loxP cassette. So when Cre is present, the stop is removed, allowing mCherry to be expressed in the same frame? Or is it a separate ORF? Maybe the ligand is expressed first, then mCherry, but only if the stop is removed.

But the main thing is, when Cre is introduced, it recombines the loxP sites, allowing the downstream genes to be expressed.

So the mice were homozygous for the construct in a wild-type background. Then they crossed them with SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice. SOX10 is expressed in neural crest cells, I think. So the Cre is under the control of SOX10, which is active in neural crest cells. So the idea is that in the offspring, the Cre would be expressed in neural crest cells, leading to recombination of the lox sites, and thus expression of the ligand, mCherry, receptor, and eGFP.

But in the experiment, when they look under the confocal, they don't see a green signal. So eGFP isn't being expressed. Hmm.

Looking at the options:

A) ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship. Paracrine means they act on nearby cells, but I'm not sure how that affects expression in the Western blot and the GFP signal. Maybe not the issue here.

B) the receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi. If the eGFP isn't being secreted or expressed on the cell surface, maybe it's retained. But the Western blot would show the protein regardless of its localization unless it's not being synthesized. But they did a Western blot and saw a signal proportional to actin, which suggests the proteins are being expressed. Wait, no, the question says that after plasmid transfection to primary astrocyte culture, they used the antibodies on Western blot. They probably saw the proteins because the actin loading is proportional, so the expression is happening. But in the mouse, after Cre, the construct is expressed, but the GFP isn't showing. Hmm.

Wait, but the mouse model is homozygous for the construct. So perhaps the construct is not being correctly recombined. Let me think about the lox sites.

In the ligand region: loxP-stop-loxP between ligand and mCherry.

In the receptor region: lox2272-stop-lox2272 between receptor and eGFP.

Wait, loxP and lox2272 are different recognition sites for Cre. LoxP is the standard site, but lox2272 is a variant that's not recognized by wild-type Cre, but is recognized by some variants, like Cre2 or high-efficiency Cre. Wait, no, I think that lox2272 is a lox site with a different sequence, but I'm not sure if wild-type Cre can cut it. Wait, Cre requires specific 34bp sequences, and lox2272 is a variant that's only recognized by certain Cre variants, like Cre-ER or other modified Cre proteins. So regular Cre (like from SOX10-Cre) might not cut lox2272.

So the idea is that the construct has two different stop cassettes: loxP in the ligand part, and lox2272 in the receptor part. So when Cre is introduced, it should recognize the loxP sites but maybe not the lox2272 sites.

Wait, but the vector is a bicistronic construct. So in the ligand part, the loxP-stop-loxP is between ligand and mCherry. So when Cre is present, it cuts the loxP sites, removing the stop, allowing mCherry to be expressed. Similarly, for the receptor-eGFP, the stop cassette is between receptor and eGFP, but the lox sites are lox2272. So normal Cre might not cut lox2272.

So in the offspring (homozygous for the construct, crossed to SOX10-Cre), the Cre would act on the loxP sites, but not on the lox2272 sites.

So in the ligand part, the stop is removed, allowing mCherry to be expressed. But for the receptor part, the stop cassette remains, so eGFP is not expressed.

In the experiment, they are looking for green signal, which comes from eGFP. But if the Cre isn't cutting the lox2272 sites, the stop remains, and eGFP isn't expressed. So the green signal isn't observed. That would explain the result in option D's problem, but let me look at the options.

Wait, the options are:

D) the receptor and the eGFP are not in the frame.

Hmm, that would mean that the stop cassette isn't excised, so the receptor and eGFP are not co-expressed. But if the stop is there, then the receptor is expressed, but eGFP isn't. So in the Western blot, would they see the receptor? Because the stop is after the receptor, but the eGFP is downstream.

Wait, the vector is set up so that the receptor is under IRES, which is after the ligand. So the receptor's ORF is in the same mRNA as the ligand? Or no, because IRES allows for internal initiation.

Wait, in a bicistronic construct with IRES, the first ORF (ligand) is under a promoter, then the IRES, then the second ORF (receptor). So the mRNA is monocistronic for the ligand, and then the IRES allows the ribosome to start translating the receptor ORF. But in this case, the ligand is under CBA, which is a strong promoter, and the receptor is under IRES.

But then the vector also has the ligand and mCherry in a setup where their ORFs are separated by a stop cassette. So without Cre, the ligand is expressed, but the mCherry isn't. With Cre, the stop is removed, so mCherry is expressed.

Similarly, for the receptor and eGFP, the stop cassette is in between, but with a different lox site. If the Cre can't cut it, then the eGFP won't be expressed.

So in the mouse experiment, the construct is homozygous, and when crossed with SOX10-Cre, the Cre should recombine the loxP sites but not the lox2272 sites. So in the ligand region, the stop is removed, so mCherry is expressed. But in the receptor region, the stop remains, so eGFP is not expressed.

Therefore, in the mice, the ligand and mCherry would be expressed in neural crest cells, but the receptor and eGFP wouldn't, because the stop cassette isn't recombined. So when they look for eGFP under the confocal, there's no green signal.

Looking at the options, the problem is that the eGFP isn't being expressed. Why? Because the stop cassette between receptor and eGFP isn't being removed. So that would be because the Cre isn't acting on the lox2272 sites. So the receptor and eGFP are not in the same reading frame because the stop is still there.

Wait, no, the stop cassette is a transcriptional stop, not a translational stop. So the mRNA for the receptor would be terminated before eGFP. So even if the receptor is expressed, eGFP isn't. So the eGFP isn't being made. So in the Western blot, after transfection, would the eGFP be expressed?

Wait, the question says that the antibodies were raised against the overexpressed proteins and that on Western blot, the signal is proportional to actin loading. So perhaps in the transfected cells, the constructs are expressed correctly when Cre is present.

Wait, maybe the issue is that in the mouse, the Cre isn't able to excise the lox2272 site, so the eGFP isn't expressed. So the mouse's Cre (from SOX10-Cre) is wild-type Cre, which might not recognize lox2272. Therefore, the stop cassette remains, and eGFP isn't expressed.

So when they look for eGFP in the offspring, nothing shows up because the Cre didn't excise the lox2272 sites.

So which option points to this? Let's check the options again.

Option D: the receptor and eGFP are not in the frame. If the lox2272 isn't cut, the stop remains, so the eGFP isn't expressed. So from the vector's perspective, the receptor is expressed, but eGFP is not. So the eGFP isn't being translated.

Alternatively, maybe the eGFP isn't being expressed because the lox2272 isn't cut, so the stop remains. So the issue is that the Cre can't cut the lox2272, so the stop remains, preventing eGFP expression.

But looking at the options, which one fits this scenario.

Option D suggests that the receptor and eGFP are not in frame, meaning that the frame is disrupted, so eGFP isn't expressed. But that would be a problem with the vector design, not the Cre.

Alternatively, if the stop cassette isn't being cut, then eGFP isn't expressed because the transcription stops before it.

Wait, the question is about why the green signal isn't observed. Based on the setup, the main issue is the lox2272 not being cut by Cre, which is a problem with the Cre/lox system, not the frame.

Looking at the options, which one fits.

Option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in the frame. That would mean that when the stop is cut, the eGFP is in a different frame, so it's not expressed. But in our case, the stop isn't cut at all because the Cre doesn't recognize lox2272. So eGFP remains unexpressed, but not because of frame issues.

But none of the options directly address the Cre not being able to cut the lox2272. So perhaps looking at the options, the correct answer is D.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's think about whether the frame is correct. If the stop is present, the eGFP isn't expressed. So in the mouse, the eGFP isn't expressed because the Cre isn't cutting the lox2272, so the stop remains. So the reason is that the lox2272 sites were not recombined, hence the stop remains, so eGFP isn't expressed.

Which option corresponds to that?

Looking at the options again:

A) paracrine relationship → probably not relevant to expression.

B) stuck in Golgi → would affect localization, but the Western blot would still show the protein.

C) enhancer missing → If the enhancer was missing, neither ligand nor receptor would be expressed, but the question says the promoter is CBA for ligand and IRES for receptor.

D) receptor and eGFP not in frame → this would mean the ORF is disrupted, but if the stop is present, then the eGFP isn't even initiated, so frame doesn't matter. Alternatively, if the stop is removed, but the eGFP is in a different frame, then it's expressed but nonfunctional.

But in the setup, the stop is between receptor and eGFP. So if the stop is cut, the eGFP should be in frame. If it's not in frame, then the eGFP won't be produced correctly. Or perhaps the stop is cut, but the eGFP is in a different reading frame, so even if the mRNA is made, the eGFP isn't translated correctly.

Wait, but if the stop is removed, the receptor's ORF is continued into eGFP. So unless the stop is in frame, which is probably not, the eGFP would be in a different frame, leading to a frameshift and a nonfunctional protein. But that's a vector design issue.

But in the mouse model, the issue is that the eGFP isn't expressed at all, so perhaps the stop isn't being cut, meaning that the eGFP isn't being expressed. So the Western blot would not show eGFP, but would show the receptor. But in the question, when they did the Western blot after plasmid transfection, they saw signals proportional to actin, which suggests that the proteins are expressed. Wait, but in the mouse, they're using the mouse's own setup, perhaps without induction.

Wait, but the question says that in the Western blot, after plasmid transfection, they saw the signals. So probably, the plasmid constructs are correctly expressed when Cre is present.

But in the mouse, they crossed to SOX10-Cre, so the construct should be activated in neural crest cells. But the eGFP isn't expressed. So the problem is that in the mouse, the Cre isn't cutting the lox2272 sites, so the stop remains, preventing eGFP expression.

But none of the options directly address this. So perhaps the problem is that the stop cassette isn't excised because the lox sites are different. So the correct answer would be D: the receptor and eGFP are not in the frame.

Wait, no. If the stop isn't cut, the eGFP isn't even started. So the reason is that the lox2272 sites aren't being cut. So the eGFP isn't expressed because the stop isn't removed. Therefore, the issue isn't the frame, but the failure to excise the stop.

But none of the options directly address this. The options are about the ligand-receptor relationship, Golgi issue, enhancer, or frame.

So perhaps the intended answer is D.

Wait, another angle: if the stop cassette isn't cut, the eGFP isn't expressed, so when they look for eGFP fluorescence, they don't see it. So the reason is that the stop wasn't excised because the Cre didn't recognize the lox2272 sites. Therefore, the eGFP isn't being made. Looking at the options, the only one that would prevent eGFP expression is D, which suggests the frame is wrong, but that's not the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the eGFP is not in frame because the stop wasn't removed, so the ORF isn't continued. No, the stop being present would stop transcription before eGFP, so the eGFP wouldn't be present at all.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let's review the options again.

Option D: the receptor and the eGFP are not in the frame. This would lead to eGFP not being produced, but only if the stop is cut, but the frame is wrong. If the stop isn't cut, the eGFP isn't expressed regardless of the frame.

In the mouse, the Cre isn't cutting the lox2272, so the stop remains. Therefore, the eGFP isn't expressed because the mRNA doesn't include it. So the issue is that the stop isn't removed. But none of the options directly state that.

Wait, but the question mentions that the vector is a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. So perhaps the issue is that the Cre can only cut one of the lox sites. If the lox sites are different (loxP and lox2272), then the Cre might only cut the loxP sites, not the lox2272.

So in the ligand region, the stop is between ligand and mCherry, which is a loxP-stop-loxP cassette. The Cre would cut that, allowing mCherry to be expressed. But in the receptor region, the stop is lox2272, which the Cre can't cut, so the eGFP isn't expressed. Therefore, the problem is that the Cre can't cut the lox2272 sites, so eGFP isn't expressed.

So which option explains this? Looking at the options, perhaps the answer is D, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe option C is about enhancers, but the promoters seem to be present.

Another angle: perhaps the enhancer for both ligand and receptor is missing. But the ligand is under CBA, which is a strong promoter, so it should be expressed. But maybe the receptor isn't being expressed because it's under an IRES, which depends on the ribosome's scanning. But the question is about eGFP, which is downstream of the receptor.

Alternatively, maybe the ligand-receptor pair is in a paracrine relationship (option A), meaning that they act on other cells, but in this case, the problem is about expression in the same cells.

Wait, the question says they are expressed in neural crest cells. So perhaps the ligand and receptor are autocrine, not paracrine. So option A is probably not the reason.

Hmm. I'm not entirely confident, but I think the problem is that the Cre can't cut the lox2272 sites, so the eGFP isn't expressed. Since the options don't mention this, the most likely option is D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. Because the stop wasn't excised, the eGFP isn't expressed. Alternatively, perhaps the stop is in the way, but the question is phrased in terms of the frame.

Wait, the stop is a transcriptional stop, not a translational stop. So the mRNA for eGFP isn't made. Therefore, the eGFP isn't expressed. So the reason is that the stop cassette isn't excised, so the eGFP isn't expressed.

But the options don't address that.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the eGFP isn't being expressed because the receptor and eGFP are not in the same frame, i.e., the stop is in a way that when the stop is excised, the eGFP is in a different reading frame. But this would only happen if the stop is excised, which it isn't in this case.

So, perhaps the intended answer is D, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe option B, but that would mean the eGFP is stuck in the Golgi, but the Western blot would still show it. The question says that the signal is proportional to actin, so the proteins are being expressed.

Wait, in the mouse, maybe the eGFP isn't expressed because the Cre didn't excise the stop, so the eGFP isn't made. So the only way this would happen is if the Cre can't cut the lox2272 sites. So the answer would be that the lox2272 sites weren't excised, but none of the options directly state that.

Given the options, the most plausible is D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps the enhancer is missing, making option C.

Wait, the enhancer is under the ligand and receptor promoters. The ligand is under CBA, which is a promoter, not necessarily an enhancer. The receptor is under an IRES element. So maybe the enhancer for the receptor is missing, so it's not expressed. But the question says that the ligand is under CBA, which is a promoter, so it should be expressed.

Alternatively, perhaps the IRES isn't functional without the proper elements. But IRES typically allows for expression without a promoter in the same mRNA.

Hmm. I think I'm going to have to make an educated guess here. The reason the eGFP isn't expressed is that the stop cassette wasn't excised, so the eGFP isn't made. The only option that could relate to this is D, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps it's a question about the IRES and the eGFP being in separate cassettes. But I think the intended answer is D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves a bicistronic lox-Cre vector expressing a ligand and receptor pair, with mCherry fused to the ligand and eGFP fused to the receptor. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, and the receptor is under an IRES element. The vector contains stop cassettes: a loxP-stop-loxP cassette between the ligand and mCherry, and a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette between the receptor and eGFP. The experiment involves crossing mice homozygous for the construct with SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice, which express Cre in neural crest cells. However, no green signal (eGFP) is observed under the confocal microscope.

Key points of analysis:

1. **Vector Design and Cre Activity**:
   - The ligand and mCherry are separated by a loxP-stop-loxP cassette. SOX10-Cre, which recognizes loxP sites, would excise this cassette, allowing mCherry to be expressed.
   - The receptor and eGFP are separated by a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette. Standard Cre (e.g., from SOX10-Cre) does not recognize lox2272 sites, so the stop cassette remains intact, preventing eGFP expression.

2. **Western Blot Results**:
   - The question states that after plasmid transfection, Western blot analysis showed signals proportional to actin loading, indicating that the proteins are expressed when Cre is present. However, in the mouse model, eGFP is not observed, suggesting that the stop cassette between the receptor and eGFP remains unexcised.

3. **Analysis of Options**:
   - **A) Paracrine relationship**: This refers to signaling between cells but does not explain the lack of eGFP expression. Irrelevant to the issue.
   - **B) Receptor-eGFP construct stuck in the Golgi**: If eGFP were mislocalized, it would still be detectable on Western blot. The absence of a signal suggests it is not synthesized, not an issue of localization.
   - **C) Enhancer for ligand and receptor expression is missing**: The ligand is under the strong CBA promoter, and the receptor is under the IRES element, which should allow expression. No evidence of a missing enhancer is provided.
   - **D) Receptor and eGFP are not in the frame**: If the stop cassette were excised but the eGFP were in a different reading frame, it would not be expressed. However, the stop cassette remains unexcised, so eGFP is not synthesized at all. This option indirectly aligns with the issue but does not fully capture the problem.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The lack of eGFP expression is due to the failure of Cre to excise the lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette, preventing eGFP synthesis. While none of the options explicitly address this, the most plausible explanation among the given choices is **D**, as it relates to the failure of proper expression of eGFP.

Answer: D
