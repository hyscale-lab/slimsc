Okay, so I've got this problem about crystallography, specifically about interplanar distances in a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, I remember that interplanar distance is the distance between adjacent planes in a crystal lattice. The question gives me the interatomic distance, which I think refers to the lattice parameter 'a', and all the angles alpha, beta, gamma are 30 degrees. The plane we're looking at is (111), and I need to find its interplanar distance.

Wait, wait, no. The interatomic distance is the distance between atoms, which in a crystal is the lattice parameter, right? So the interatomic distance here is given as 10 Angstrom. So that's 'a' equals 10 Å.

The problem is to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. I remember there's a formula for interplanar distance in crystals. Oh right, for any plane (hkl), the interplanar distance 'd' is given by d = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2(hk cos gamma) - 2(hl cos beta) - 2(kl cos alpha) ) ) or something like that? Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing it up. Alternatively, when the crystal has lattice parameters a, b, c and angles alpha, beta, gamma, the formula is a bit more general.

Wait, another approach. For a cubic system, the formula is d = a / sqrt(h² +k² +l²), because all angles are 90 degrees, so the cos terms are zero. But in this case, the crystal is rhombohedral, which is a special case where a = b = c, and all angles are equal (alpha = beta = gamma). So maybe the formula simplifies.

Rhombohedral is a type of hexagonal system? No, wait, no, rhombohedral is a form of the cubic system. Wait, I'm a bit confused. Oh, right, in the cubic system, when the angles are all 90 degrees, it's just cubic. But when the angles are all equal but not 90 degrees, it's called rhombohedral. So the lattice parameters a, b, c are all equal (a=b=c), but angles are 30 degrees each.

So the formula for the interplanar distance in a general crystal system is:

d_{hkl} = (a^2 (b^2 c^2) )^(1/2) / ( (h k l) · something ) )

Wait, perhaps it's better to use the general formula for interplanar distance in terms of the reciprocal lattice. Wait, another thought: the formula is d = 1 / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) - 2(hk cos gamma) - 2(hl cos beta) - 2(kl cos alpha) ) ), but wait, that's in reciprocal space. No, wait, I think the correct formula is:

d_{hkl} = (1 / √( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2)/(a^2) - 2 hk cos γ/(a^2) - 2 hl cos β/(a^2) - 2 kl cos α/(a^2) )) )

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should look for the specific formula for a rhombohedral crystal. Oh, wait, in a rhombohedral system, since a = b = c and alpha = beta = gamma, the formula might simplify.

So for a rhombohedral lattice, the interplanar distance for (hkl) is given by:

d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos α )

Wait, because all the angles are the same. So in this case, all angles are 30 degrees, so cos(30 degrees) is sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.866.

The problem is for (111) plane, so h=k=l=1.

Plugging the values in:

d = a / sqrt( 1² +1² +1² - 2(1*1 +1*1 +1*1) cos 30 )

Calculating denominator inside sqrt:

First, compute the sum of squares: 1+1+1 =3.

Then compute 2(hk + hl + kl) cos α. Since h=k=l=1:

hk = 1*1=1, same for hl and kl. So the sum is 1+1+1=3. Multiply by 2: 6. Multiply by cos(30): 6*(sqrt(3)/2) = 3*sqrt(3) ≈5.196.

So denominator is sqrt(3 - 5.196) ?

Wait, wait, wait. That can't be right. 3 -5.196 is negative. So sqrt of a negative number? That's impossible. What did I do wrong?

Hmm, maybe I got the formula wrong. Let me think again. Maybe the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) - 2(hk cos γ + hl cos β + kl cos α) )

In a rhombohedral lattice, all the angles are the same, so α=β=γ=30 degrees.

So for (111) plane, h=k=l=1.

So the denominator is sqrt( 3 - 2(1*1 cos30 + 1*1 cos30 + 1*1 cos30 ) )

Which is sqrt(3 - 2*(3 * cos30) )

cos30 is sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.866.

So 3*0.866 = approx 2.598.

Multiply by 2: 5.196.

So denominator: 3-5.196 = -2.196.

Wait, that's negative. That can't be right. Because the square root of a negative number isn't real. That suggests I messed up the formula.

Hmm, maybe the formula has a different sign. Perhaps plus 2(...), not minus?

Wait, maybe the correct formula is:

d = a / sqrt( h² +k² +l² + 2(hk cos γ + hl cos β + kl cos α) )

Wait, that might make sense because the general formula for the interplanar distance in a hexagonal system (which uses a different approach) has a similar structure, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let me check another approach. The interplanar distance formula for a general crystal system is given by:

d_{hkl} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{ ( (h a)^2 + (k b)^2 + (l c)^2 ) / (V^2) ) - 2 (h k a b cos γ ) / V^2 - 2 (h l a c cos β ) / V^2 - 2 (k l b c cos α ) / V^2 ) } }

Where V is the volume of the unit cell, V = a b c sqrt(1 - cos² alpha - cos² beta - cos² gamma + 2 cos alpha cos beta cos gamma) )

Wait, this is getting complicated. Maybe for the rhombohedral case where a=b=c and alpha=beta=gamma, this gets simpler.

In rhombohedral, a=b=c=a0, and alpha=beta=gamma=alpha. So V = a0^3 * sqrt(1 - 3 cos² alpha + 2 cos^3 alpha )

Wait, yeah, because the volume becomes a0^3 multiplied by sqrt(1 - (cos^2 alpha + cos^2 beta + cos^2 gamma ) + 2 cos alpha cos beta cos gamma )

Since all angles are alpha, it becomes 1 - 3 cos^2 alpha + 2 cos^3 alpha.

So, the denominator in the d formula for rhombohedral is:

sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) a0^2 + 2 (h k a0^2 cos gamma) + 2 (h l a0^2 cos beta) + 2 (k l a0^2 cos alpha) ) ) / V )

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe it's better to use the formula that's specific for the rhombohedral system.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the interplanar distance for (hkl) in rhombohedral is given by:

d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos α )

Wait, because in this case, the denominator would be sqrt(3 + 2*(3) * cos 30 ), since h=k=l=1.

Cos 30 is about 0.866, so 2*(3)*0.866 is 5.196. So 3 +5.196 is 8.196. Square root of that is about 2.863. So d would be 10 / 2.863 ≈3.494 Angstrom. But looking at the options, none of them are near 3.5. So this can't be right.

Hmm, maybe I confused the formula. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

d = a / sqrt( h² +k² +l² - 2 (hk cos α + hl cos α + kl cos α) )

Because in the rhombohedral case, all angles are alpha, so each term is the same.

So for h=k=l=1:

Denominator is sqrt(3 - 2*(3 * cos alpha) )

Which is sqrt(3 - 6 cos alpha )

Wait, so cos 30 is 0.866. So 6 * 0.866 =5.196.

3 -5.196 = -2.196. So sqrt(-2.196) is imaginary. That can't be right. So this suggests the formula I'm using is incorrect.

Hmm, perhaps I have the sign wrong. Maybe it's plus 2(...), not minus.

So denominator is sqrt(3 + 6 cos alpha )

So 3 +6*(0.866) =3 +5.196=8.196.

Square root is approx 2.863.

So d =10 /2.863≈3.494. Again, not matching the options.

Wait, all the options are around 9 Angstrom. Hmm, that suggests that my approach is wrong.

Alternative thought: perhaps the formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is the same as the cubic case, but with a scaled lattice parameter because the angles are not 90 degrees.

Wait, in a cubic system, d = a/(sqrt(h² +k² +l²)).

But in rhombohedral, if the angles are 30 degrees, maybe the effective a is smaller? Or perhaps the interplanar distance formula is modified.

Wait, perhaps I should refer to the general formula for interplanar distance in a triclinic system, which is:

1/d² = (h²/a²) + (k²/b²) + (l²/c²) - 2hk cos gamma/(a b) - 2hl cos beta/(a c) - 2kl cos alpha/(b c)

But in this case, a=b=c=10 Angstrom, and alpha=beta=gamma=30 degrees.

So substituting:

1/d² = (1/10²)(1 +1 +1) - 2*(1*1)*cos30/(10*10)* (1+1+1)

Wait, no, let's compute each term step by step.

h=k=l=1.

So,

1/d² = [ (1²)/(10²) + (1²)/(10²) + (1²)/(10²) ]

Which is 3/(100) = 0.03.

Then, the other terms:

- 2*(1*1) cos30 / (10*10) for gamma term.

But since all the angles are the same, there are three such terms (gamma, beta, alpha).

Wait, no, the general formula is:

1/d² = (h²/a²) + (k²/b²) + (l²/c²) - [ 2 hk cos gamma/(a b) + 2 hl cos beta/(a c) + 2 kl cos alpha/(b c) ]

In this case, a =b =c=10, alpha=beta=gamma=30.

So,

1/d² = (1/100 +1/100 +1/100) - [ 2*(1*1)*cos30/(10*10) + 2*(1*1)*cos30/(10*10) + 2*(1*1)*cos30/(10*10) ]

That's 3/100 minus 3 * [ 2*(0.866)/(100) ]

Wait, 2*(0.866) is around 1.732.

So,

1/d² = 0.03 - 3*(1.732/100) )

Which is 0.03 - (3 * 0.01732 ) = 0.03 - 0.05196 = -0.02196.

But 1/d² can't be negative. That's impossible. So I must have a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the sign of the cos terms. Let me check: the general formula for 1/d² is:

1/d² = (h^2/a²) + (k^2/b²) + (l^2/c²) - 2 hk cos γ/(a b) - 2 hl cos β/(a c) - 2 kl cos α/(b c)

Wait, so each cross term has a negative sign.

But in this case:

Compute each term:

h²/a² =1/100; same for k and l. Sum is 3/100=0.03.

Now, the cross terms:

-2 hk cos gamma/(a b) = -2*(1)(1)*cos30/(10*10) = -2 * 0.866 / 100 = -0.01732.

Similarly, the other terms are the same because all angles are 30 degrees. So three cross terms, each -0.01732.

So total cross terms: 3*(-0.01732)= -0.05196.

So 1/d²= 0.03 - (-0.05196) ? No, wait, no: the formula is sum of squares minus sum of cross terms.

Wait, the formula is:

1/d² = (sum h²/a²) - sum ( cross terms )

Each cross term is positive in the formula? Or is it subtracted.

Wait, no, the formula is:

1/d² = (h²/a² + k²/b² + l²/c² ) - [ 2 hk cos gamma/(a b) + 2 hl cos beta/(a c) + 2 kl cos alpha/(b c) ]

So the cross terms are subtracted. So:

1/d² = 0.03 - 0.05196.

Which is 0.03 -0.05196= -0.02196.

Negative again, which can't be. So that can't be right. So perhaps the formula is incorrect, or my approach is wrong.

Wait, maybe I confused the formula. Another thought: perhaps the formula should have the cross terms positive? No, I don't think so. Because for a cubic system, when angles are 90 degrees, cos gamma=0, so cross terms are zero, and 1/d² is (h² +k² +l²)/(a²), which is correct.

But in this case, with angles not 90, we're getting a negative 1/d², which is impossible. That suggests that the (111) plane doesn't exist in this system, but that's not possible. Or perhaps I'm making a mistake in the units.

Wait, the given interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom. Wait, interatomic distance in a crystal is usually the lattice parameter 'a' for a cubic system. So in this case, the lattice parameter a is 10 Angstrom.

Wait, perhaps the formula is correct, but the result is negative, which would imply that the (111) planes are not present in this crystal structure. But that can't be, because the question is asking about it.

So perhaps the mistake is in the formula's sign. Maybe it should be a plus instead of a minus?

Let me try with plus:

1/d² = 0.03 + 0.05196 = 0.08196.

So d ≈ 1/sqrt(0.08196) ≈ 1/0.286 ≈3.49 Å.

But the options are way higher, around 9 Angstrom.

Hmm, perhaps I'm confusing the interatomic distance with the interplanar distance.

Wait, the interatomic distance is a =10 Angstrom. The interplanar distance is d, which is usually smaller than a. But the options are around 9, which is close to a.

Wait, maybe I'm using the wrong formula. Let me think of another approach.

Alternatively, in a rhombohedral system, the plane (111) would have a certain interplanar distance that can be calculated using the formula for a face-centered cubic or something else. But wait, rhombohedral is a different system.

Wait, another approach: the interplanar distance can be found using the formula:

d = a * sqrt( ( (1^2 +1^2 +1^2 ) ) )^{-1} ) * sqrt( (1 - cos^2 alpha) + (1 - cos^2 beta) + (1 - cos^2 gamma) ) )

Wait, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I should think of the reciprocal lattice.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should look for another way to compute d.

Wait, the interplanar distance for (hkl) in a rhombohedral system can be calculated using:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos α )

Wait, if I try this, then for (111):

Denominator: sqrt(3 + 2*(3)*cos30).

Which is sqrt(3 + 6*(sqrt(3)/2) )= sqrt(3 + 3*sqrt(3)).

Compute 3*sqrt(3) ≈5.196.

So 3+5.196=8.196. sqrt(8.196)= approx 2.863.

So d =10 /2.863≈3.494 Å.

Again, this doesn't match the options.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

d = (a) / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos α )

But then denominator is sqrt( 3 -6*0.866 )= sqrt(3-5.196)=sqrt(-2.196), which is imaginary. So that can't be.

Hmm. Maybe I'm missing a factor. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² + l²) - (2 hk cos gamma + 2 hl cos beta + 2 kl cos alpha) )

Which would be same as before, leading to negative inside sqrt.

Wait, this is getting me nowhere. Let me think about the structure.

In a rhombohedral system, the lattice vectors are a, b, c with a=b=c. The angles are all 30 degrees.

The (111) plane would be defined by the planes cutting the lattice vectors at 1/1/1.

Wait, perhaps using the Miller indices, I can compute the plane's normal vector and compute the distance.

The general formula for interplanar distance is d = 1/(sqrt( (h/a)^2 + (k/b)^2 + (l/c)^2 ) - ... ) Hmm, no, I think that's not correct.

Wait, another formula: in a cubic system, d = a/sqrt(h² +k² +l²). But in a non-cubic system, it's more complicated.

Wait, perhaps in a rhombohedral system, the formula for d is similar to the cubic case, but scaled by a factor due to the angles.

Wait, perhaps the interplanar distance is given by:

d = (a) / sqrt( h² +k² +l² + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos α )

Wait, but earlier that gave a d of 3.49 Å, which is not matching the options.

Wait, the given options are all around 9-10 Angstrom, which is larger than 'a' of 10. That doesn't make sense because d is usually smaller than a.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: in a rhombohedral system, the unit cell is a rhombohedron. The (111) plane's interplanar distance can be found using the height of the unit cell in the direction of the plane.

Wait, perhaps I can calculate the volume of the unit cell and then find d.

The volume V = a^3 * sqrt(1 - 3 cos^2 α + 2 cos^3 α )

For α=30 degrees, cos α = sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.866.

So V = 10^3 * sqrt(1 - 3*(3/4) + 2*(sqrt(3)/2)^3 )

Compute inside the sqrt:

1 - 3*(0.75) + 2*( (3√3)/8 )

= 1 -2.25 + 2*( (3√3)/8 )

= -1.25 + (6√3)/8.

√3 is about 1.732, so 6*1.732=10.392. Divide by 8: ~1.299.

So inside the sqrt: -1.25 + 1.299 ≈0.049.

So V = 1000 * sqrt(0.049) ≈1000 *0.221≈221 Å^3.

Now, the formula for interplanar distance is d = V / (a² * sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) + 2(hk cos gamma + hl cos beta + kl cos alpha) )) )

Wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps using the formula d = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - (2hk cos γ + 2hl cos β + 2kl cos α) ) )

But for (111) and all angles 30 degrees, this gives denominator sqrt(3 - 6 cos 30 ) which is sqrt(3 - 5.196)=sqrt(-2.196) which is imaginary. So that's not possible.

Hmm, perhaps I'm in the wrong approach. Another thought: perhaps the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system can be calculated using the same formula as in the cubic system but scaled by a factor due to the angles.

Wait, maybe the formula is:

d = a * sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) )^{-1} * sqrt( (1 - cos^2 α) + (1 - cos^2 β) + (1 - cos^2 gamma) ) )

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to use the formula for a hexagonal system, but no, the question is about rhombohedral.

Wait, another approach: the interplanar distance for a plane (hkl) can be found using the reciprocal lattice vectors.

Wait, for a rhombohedral lattice, the reciprocal lattice vectors are given by:

b1 = (1/a)(2h + k + l) etc. Hmm, perhaps this is too complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula:

d = 1 / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2 (hk cos gamma + hl cos beta + kl cos alpha) ) * (1/a)

Wait, but plug in the numbers:

h=k=l=1, a=10, angles=30.

So denominator inside sqrt is 3 - 2*( 3 * cos30 )

Which is 3 - 6*(0.866)=3-5.196=−2.196.

This is impossible, which suggests that either the formula is wrong or I have made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, perhaps in the formula, the angles are different. For example, in the formula, the angles are between vectors a and b, a and c, b and c. So for rhombohedral, all three angles are 30 degrees.

Wait, but I think I've been using the formula correctly.

Another thought: perhaps the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos α )

Which would give, for (111):

d=10 / sqrt(3 + 6*(0.866) )=10/ sqrt(3+5.196)=10/sqrt(8.196)=10/2.863≈3.494 Å.

But the options are in the 9-10 range.

Wait, but perhaps the question is using a different definition. Maybe 'interatomic distance' refers to the distance between adjacent atoms along a different direction, not the lattice parameter 'a'?

Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to calculate the distance between the planes using a different approach.

Wait, perhaps the formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is same as for a cubic system, but with a different 'a' due to the angles.

Wait, but I think that's not correct. Because the angles affect the geometry.

Hmm, maybe I should look up the formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral crystal.

Upon thinking, the correct formula for a rhombohedral crystal (a=b=c, alpha=beta=gamma) is:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( h² +k² +l² + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos α )

Wait, try this again.

h=k=l=1.

So denominator is sqrt(3 + 6 cos 30 ) = sqrt(3 +6*(√3/2)).

√3/2 is about 0.866, so 6*0.866≈5.196.

3 +5.196=8.196. sqrt(8.196)≈2.863.

So d =10/2.863≈3.494 Å.

But this is not matching any of the options. The options are all around 9 Angstrom.

Wait, perhaps the formula is written differently. Maybe it's:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos α )

But that gives imaginary numbers, as before.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

d = a / ( sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) ) * sqrt( 1 - ( 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos α )/(h^2 +k^2 +l^2) ) ) )

But that's getting too complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is using the formula as if it's a cubic system, ignoring the angles. So d = a / sqrt(3) =10/1.732 ≈5.773 Å. Still not matching the options.

Wait, none of my calculations are matching the options. The options are all in the 9's. So perhaps I have the formula wrong, and the correct calculation gives around 9 Angstrom.

Wait, another approach: maybe I'm supposed to consider the unit cell edges as vectors and compute the distance between two planes.

The (111) plane is defined by the equation lx + my + nz = 1. The normal vector is (l, m, n), which in this case is (1,1,1).

The distance between two adjacent planes can be found by projecting the lattice vector onto the normal direction.

The formula for the interplanar distance d is:

d = (a) * ( sqrt( (1^2 +1^2 +1^2) ) )^{-1} ) * sqrt( (1 - cos^2 30 ) + (1 - cos^2 30 ) + (1 - cos^2 30 ) )

Wait, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the distance is determined by the height of the unit cell in the direction of the normal vector.

Wait, the height can be calculated using the formula:

h = a * sqrt( (1 - cos^2 α - cos^2 β - cos^2 gamma + 2 cos α cos beta cos gamma )) 

But in this case, all angles are 30 degrees.

So,

h = a * sqrt( 3*(1 - (3/4) ) + 2*( (sqrt(3)/2 )^3 ) )

Wait, wait:

h = 10 * sqrt( 3*(1 - 0.75) + 2*( (sqrt(3)/2 )^3 ) )

=10 * sqrt(3*(0.25) + 2*( (3*sqrt(3))/8 ) )

=10 * sqrt( 0.75 + (6*sqrt(3))/8 )

Simplify:

0.75 =3/4.

(6√3)/8 = (3√3)/4 ≈ (3 *1.732)/4 ≈5.196/4≈1.299.

So,

h = 10 * sqrt(0.75 +1.299 )=10 * sqrt(2.049)≈10 *1.431≈14.31 Å.

But I'm not sure how this helps.

Alternatively, perhaps the interplanar distance is the height of the unit cell divided by the square root of the sum of squares of the indices.

In this case, the height is 14.31 Å, and the sum of squares of (1,1,1) is 3.

So d=14.31 / sqrt(3)≈14.31/1.732≈8.265 Å.

Hmm, option B is 8.95, option A is 9.08. Not matching exactly, but perhaps this approach is wrong.

Wait, but I'm getting 8.26 which isn't even an option. The closest is option B(8.95), but it's not exact.

Hmm, perhaps I should try another approach. Let me think about the relationship between the interplanar distance and the lattice parameter in a rhombohedral system.

Wait, another formula I found online (from past knowledge): For a rhombohedral system, the interplanar distance is given by:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos α )

Wait, that's what I tried earlier, giving d≈3.49 Å, which isn't matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula should be:

d = (a * sqrt(3)) / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos α )

But that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2 (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) cos α )

Which for (111) would be:

sqrt(3 - 2*3* cos30 )

Again, same problem as before.

I'm stuck. Since none of the formulas I know seem to give an answer matching the options, perhaps I should look for another approach.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in the initial assumption. What if the interatomic distance isn't 'a' but something else? For example, perhaps it's the distance between atoms along the diagonal, but that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the given interatomic distance is along the edge of the unit cell, but in a rhombohedral system, the edges are at 30 degrees. So the interatomic distance along the edge is 10 Å, but the distance in the plane is different.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to use the formula as if it were a face-centered cubic, but for (111) planes.

In a cubic system, d = a/√3. For a=10, d=10/√3≈5.773 Å. But again, not matching options.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that in a rhombohedral system, a is not the interatomic distance, but the edge length is a, but interatomic distance is something else. For example, in some crystal systems, the interatomic distance is a√2 or a√3, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the given interatomic distance is the edge length, and the question is to find the interplanar distance, which for (111) is a/√3=10/1.732≈5.773 Å. But again, not matching options.

Wait, the options are all around 9, which is close to 10. So perhaps the answer is approximately 10, but adjusted for the angles.

Wait, maybe the formula is d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos α )

But with h=k=l=1, gives:

d=10/ sqrt(3 -6*0.866 )=10 / sqrt(3-5.196)=sqrt(-2.196), which is impossible. So perhaps the formula is d= a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos α )

Which gives d=10/sqrt(3+5.196)=10/sqrt(8.196)≈3.494 Å.

But none of the options are near 3.5.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is in the reciprocal of the formula. What if the formula is d = a * sqrt( ... )

Wait, I'm getting more confused. Maybe I should look for the correct formula.

Upon recalling, the correct formula for interplanar distance in a general crystal system is:

1/d² = (h²/a²) + (k²/b²) + (l²/c²) - 2hk cos gamma/(a b) - 2 hl cos beta/(a c) - 2 kl cos alpha/(b c)

In this problem, a=b=c=10, alpha=beta=gamma=30°, h=k=l=1.

So,

1/d² = (1/10²)*3 - 2*(1)(1) cos30/(10*10) *3

= 3/100 - (3 * 2 * 0.866 )/(100 )

= 0.03 - (3 * 1.732 ) / 100

= 0.03 - 0.05196

= -0.02196

Which is negative. Can't be. So perhaps the formula is incorrect or I'm making a mistake.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the formula is 

1/d² = ( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) )/(a^2) - 2 (hk cos gamma + hl cos beta + kl cos alpha )/(a^2 )

Which would be:

1/d² = (3)/(100) - 2*(3 * 0.866)/(100 )

= 0.03 - (5.196)/100

= 0.03 -0.05196= -0.02196 → same result.

So negative again. So this suggests that for (111) plane, in this crystal, the interplanar distance is imaginary, which is impossible. So perhaps the (111) plane is not allowed in this structure.

But the question is asking to compute it, so I must be wrong.

Wait, perhaps the angles are given in a different way. For example, in the formula, the angles are between the axes, but perhaps the angles given are between the vectors.

Wait, perhaps I should use the reciprocal of the formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is d = sqrt( (a^2 + b^2 + c^2) ... ) but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: find the distance between two adjacent planes in the (111) family.

The (111) planes are spaced such that their normals are along the (111) direction. So the interplanar distance d is the distance between two planes along this normal.

The vector normal to the (111) plane is (1,1,1). The distance between two such planes can be found by projecting the lattice vectors onto this normal.

So perhaps the interplanar distance is:

d = (a) * ( |(1,1,1)| )^{-1} * sqrt( (1 - cos^2 alpha - cos^2 beta - cos^2 gamma + 2 cos alpha cos beta cos gamma ) )

I'm not confident about this, but let's try.

Compute |(1,1,1)| = sqrt(1 +1 +1 )=sqrt(3).

So,

d =10 / sqrt(3) * sqrt( 3*(1 - (sqrt(3)/2)^2 ) + 2*( (sqrt(3)/2 )^3 ) )

Wait, compute inside the second sqrt:

3*(1 - 3/4) = 3*(1/4)=3/4=0.75.

2*( (sqrt(3)/2 )^3 )=2*( (3*sqrt(3))/8 )= (6*sqrt(3))/8= (3*sqrt(3))/4≈1.299.

So,

d= (10/1.732) * sqrt(0.75+1.299) = (5.773) * sqrt(2.049)≈5.773 *1.431≈8.265 Å.

Hmm, 8.265 is close to option B (8.95) but not exactly. So perhaps I'm making a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me compute sqrt(2.049):

sqrt(2.049)= approx 1.431.

So 5.773 *1.431= approx 8.265. So option B is 8.95, which is a bit higher. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Maybe the second sqrt is not multiplied but added.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the volume and then use it in the formula.

Volume V= a^3 * sqrt(1 - 3 cos^2 alpha + 2 cos^3 alpha )

=10^3 * sqrt(1 -3*(3/4) + 2*( (sqrt(3)/2 )^3 ) )

=1000 * sqrt(1 -9/4 + 2*(3*sqrt(3)/8) )

=1000 * sqrt( ( -5/4 ) + (3*sqrt(3)/4 ) )

=1000 * sqrt( ( -5 +3*sqrt(3) ) /4 )

Compute 3*sqrt(3)=5.196, so -5 +5.196=0.196.

So V=1000 * sqrt(0.196/4)=1000* sqrt(0.049)=1000 *0.221≈221 Å³.

Now, using the formula for interplanar distance:

d = V / (a² * sqrt( h² +k² +l² + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos alpha ) )

Wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps d= (V^{1/3}) / sqrt( h² +k² +l^2 - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos alpha )

Wait, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps d= (a * b * c )^{1/3} / ( sqrt( h² +k² +l^2 + 2 hk cos gamma + ... )) )

I'm getting stuck again. Since I'm stuck and the time is limited, perhaps I should make an educated guess. The calculation I did earlier gave approximately 8.265, which is close to option B (8.95) but not exactly. Another approach I tried gave 8.265, which is close to option B but perhaps the correct answer is option C (9.54), but that's further away.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos α )

Which gives d=10/sqrt(3 + 5.196)=10/sqrt(8.196)=10/2.863≈3.494 Å, but that doesn't match any option.

Wait, perhaps the angles aren't 30 degrees but 60 degrees? No, the question states 30 degrees.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is d= a * sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) )^{-1} * sqrt( (1 - cos^2 alpha) + (1 - cos^2 beta) + (1 - cos^2 gamma) )

Which would be d=10 / sqrt(3) * sqrt(3*(1 - 3/4))=10/1.732 * sqrt(3*(1/4))=10/1.732 * sqrt(3/4)=10/1.732 * (sqrt(3)/2)=10/(1.732) * (1.732/2)=10 * (1/2)=5 Å. Still not matching.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Another thought: maybe the problem is intended to be solved using the cubic formula despite the angles, which would give d=10/sqrt(3)=5.773, but it's not an option. So perhaps I'm missing a scaling factor due to the angles.

Wait, perhaps the effective a is modified due to the angles. Since the lattice is compressed, the effective a in the direction of the (111) plane is longer. So the interplanar distance would be larger than in the cubic case.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

d = a / [ sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) ) * sin(theta) ]

Where theta is the angle between the lattice vector and the normal.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is d = a * sqrt( 1 + cos^2 alpha + cos^2 beta + cos^2 gamma ... )

Wait, I'm not getting anywhere.

Given that I can't find a formula that gives one of the options, perhaps I should consider the possibility that the correct answer is option C (9.54 Å), but I'm not confident.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) )

Which in cubic gives d=10/√3≈5.773. But that's not in the options.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses a different approach, like using the height of the unit cell.

The height of the unit cell along the (111) direction can be calculated as a * cos(alpha), but I'm not sure.

Wait, the height (H) of the unit cell along the [111] direction is given by H = a * (sqrt(3)/3) * sqrt(3 + 2 cos alpha )

Wait, for alpha=30 degrees,

H=10 * (sqrt(3)/3) * sqrt(3 + 2*(sqrt(3)/2 ))

=10 * (0.577) * sqrt(3 + 1.732 )

=10 *0.577 * sqrt(4.732 )

sqrt(4.732)=2.175.

So H=10 *0.577 *2.175≈10 *1.258≈12.58 Å.

But how does this relate to the interplanar distance?

Wait, perhaps the interplanar distance is H / (h^2 +k^2 +l^2 ), which for (111) is H/3.

So d=12.58/3≈4.194 Å. Still not matching the options.

Hmm. I'm stuck, and time is limited. Based on the earlier calculation where I got 8.265, which is closest to option B (8.95), but not exactly, perhaps the intended answer is option A (9.08) or B (8.95). Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula and the correct answer is option C (9.54).

Wait, another approach: perhaps I should calculate the reciprocal of the interplanar spacing.

Wait, let's try using the formula:

1/d² = (3)/(10²) - 3*(2 * 10 *10 *0.866 )/(10^4 )

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos alpha )

Which for (111):

d=10/ sqrt(3 - 6 *0.866 )

Which is sqrt(-2.196), which is impossible. So perhaps the correct answer is that the (111) plane is not possible in this structure.

But the question is asking for the distance, so I must be missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos alpha )

Which gives d=10/ sqrt(3 +5.196)=10/2.863≈3.494 Å.

But this isn't matching any options.

Wait, perhaps the problem was given in a different way. Maybe the angles are between the planes, not the lattice vectors. Or perhaps it's a mistake in the problem.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula uses cos(theta) as cos(60 degrees) instead of 30, but that's not what the question states.

I think I've exhausted all possible approaches I can think of. Given the options, perhaps the correct answer is option C (9.54), but I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A (9.08), but I can't find a formula that gives that.

Wait, another idea: perhaps the formula is:

d = a * ( sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) ) ) / ( sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos alpha ) )

Which would give d=10 * sqrt(3)/sqrt(3 +5.196)=10 *1.732/2.863≈10 *0.605≈6.05 Å. Still not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

d = a * sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos alpha ) / (h^2 +k^2 +l^2 )

Which would be d=10 * sqrt(3-5.196)/3 → which is imaginary. So no.

I'm stuck, but given the options, I think the intended answer is option C (9.54), but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the correct calculation isn't matching any options, but given the options, the closest I can get is perhaps option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the interplanar distance \( d \) for the (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal with lattice parameter \( a = 10 \, \text{Å} \) and angles \( \alpha = \beta = \gamma = 30^\circ \), the formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is used:

\[
d_{hkl} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{h^2 + k^2 + l^2 + 2(hk + hl + kl) \cos \alpha}}
\]

For the (111) plane, \( h = k = l = 1 \), and \( \cos 30^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \approx 0.866 \). Substituting these values:

1. Compute the denominator:
   \[
   \sqrt{h^2 + k^2 + l^2 + 2(hk + hl + kl) \cos \alpha} = \sqrt{3 + 2(3) \cdot 0.866}
   \]
   \[
   = \sqrt{3 + 5.196} = \sqrt{8.196} \approx 2.863
   \]

2. Calculate \( d \):
   \[
   d = \frac{10}{2.863} \approx 3.494 \, \text{Å}
   \]

This result does not match any of the provided options, which are all around 9–10 Å. Repeated attempts to adjust the formula or consider alternative approaches (e.g., using the cubic system formula or scaling factors) also fail to align with the given options.

Given the discrepancy, it is possible that the problem assumes a different interpretation of the interatomic distance or a simplified formula. Based on the options, the closest plausible answer is **C) 9.54 Å**, though the reasoning does not fully justify this choice.

Answer: C
