Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The setup is that we have a large ensemble of 10,000 identical systems. Each system has a particle that's under the same conditions. The particles can move along a tube, which is along the x-axis direction. The wave function for each particle is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) minus 0.5i. And when they measured the position of the particles, they only found them between x=1 and x=3. So, the question is to find the value of 'a'.

Hmm, okay. So, the wave function is given as ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Wait, that can't be right because the wave function must be such that the probability density integrates to 1 over the region where the particle exists. Also, the presence of an imaginary component here might be confusing. Wait, in quantum mechanics, the wave function is usually a complex function. But the modulus squared gives the probability density.

Wait, but the wave function being given as (a/sqrt(1+x)) minus 0.5i. That's interesting. So ψ(x) is a complex number. When dealing with wave functions, the probability density is |ψ(x)|². So, for each x in the region [1,3], the probability of finding the particle is the square of the magnitude of ψ.

So, the first thing I should probably do is compute the probability density, which is |ψ(x)|². Let's write that out.

ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i.

So, the magnitude squared is (a/sqrt(1+x))² + (0.5)^2, because when you have a complex number A + Bi, the magnitude squared is A² + B².

So, |ψ(x)|² = (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25.

Now, since the particle is only found between x=1 and x=3, this must be the region where the wave function is non-zero, and the integral of the probability density over this interval should equal 1, because the total probability is 1.

So, the integral from x=1 to x=3 of |ψ(x)|² dx equals 1.

Plugging in the expression for |ψ(x)|²:

∫ (from 1 to 3) [ (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx = 1.

Let's split this integral into two parts:

Integral of (a²)/(1+x) dx from 1 to 3, plus integral of 0.25 dx from 1 to 3, equals 1.

Let me compute each part.

First, the integral of (a²)/(1+x) dx. Let u = 1 + x, so du = dx. The limits when x=1, u=2; x=3, u=4.

So, the integral becomes a² ∫ (1/u) du from 2 to 4.

The integral of 1/u is ln|u|. So,

a² [ ln(4) - ln(2) ] = a² ln(4/2) = a² ln(2).

Second part: integral of 0.25 dx from 1 to 3. That's 0.25*(3-1) = 0.25*2 = 0.5.

Adding both parts together:

a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So, a² ln(2) = 0.5.

Solve for a²:

a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

What's ln(2)? Approximately 0.6931.

So, a² ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7202.

Taking square root: a ≈ sqrt(0.7202) ≈ 0.8485.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.85, which is close to that. So, the answer should be option B.

Wait, but wait a minute. Let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

1. The wave function is given as (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So, the real part is a/sqrt(1+x), the imaginary part is -0.5. So when taking the magnitude squared, it's (a²)/(1+x) + (0.5)^2 = (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25. That's correct.

2. The integral from 1 to 3 of that gives the total probability. Correct.

3. The integral of (a²)/(1+x) dx is a² ln(x+1) evaluated from 1 to 3. Wait, wait, wait! Wait another second. Because in my initial substitution, I set u =1 +x, so the integral from x=1 to x=3 of 1/(1+x) dx is equal to ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(2) — correct. So the first integral is a² ln(2). The second integral is 0.25 * (3-1) = 0.5. So correct.

So, yes, a² = 0.5 / ln(2) ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7202 → a ≈ 0.8485, which rounds to 0.85. So option B is the correct answer.

The problem involves determining the value of "a" in the wave function of a particle, given that the particle is only found between \( x = 1 \) and \( x = 3 \). The wave function is provided as:

\[
\psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1 + x}} - 0.5i
\]

The probability density is given by the magnitude squared of the wave function:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1 + x}}\right)^2 + (0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1 + x} + 0.25
\]

Since the particle is only found between \( x = 1 \) and \( x = 3 \), the total probability over this interval must equal 1. Thus, the integral of \( |\psi(x)|^2 \) from \( x = 1 \) to \( x = 3 \) is:

\[
\int_1^3 \left(\frac{a^2}{1 + x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1
\]

This integral can be split into two parts:

1. **First term**:  
   \[
   \int_1^3 \frac{a^2}{1 + x} dx
   \]
   Let \( u = 1 + x \), so \( du = dx \). The limits change to \( u = 2 \) (when \( x = 1 \)) and \( u = 4 \) (when \( x = 3 \)). The integral becomes:
   \[
   a^2 \int_2^4 \frac{1}{u} du = a^2 \left[\ln(u)\right]_2^4 = a^2 \ln\left(\frac{4}{2}\right) = a^2 \ln(2)
   \]

2. **Second term**:  
   \[
   \int_1^3 0.25 dx
   \]
   This evaluates to:
   \[
   0.25 \cdot (3 - 1) = 0.5
   \]

Adding both parts together:
\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1
\]

Solving for \( a^2 \):
\[
a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}
\]

Using \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \):
\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7202
\]

Taking the square root:
\[
a \approx \sqrt{0.7202} \approx 0.8485
\]

The closest option to this value is \( 0.85 \), corresponding to option **B**.
