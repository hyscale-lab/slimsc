Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their photospheres. Hmm, let me see. The question says that iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh right, and the energy difference between the levels is 1.38e-23 J. Oh, and both photospheres are in LTE, which means Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium, so I can probably use the Boltzmann equation here.

Wait, the Boltzmann equation relates the number of particles in different energy levels with temperature. Right, the formula is n_i / n_j = (g_i/g_j) * exp( - (E_i - E_j)/(k*T) ). Since the question is about excitation, I think E_i is higher than E_j, so E_i - E_j is positive. 

In this case, the ratio of the excited atoms is given. Star_1 has twice as excited as star_2. So the ratio n1/n2 = 2. Because for each star, the same energy levels are considered. So for star_1, the excited state is n1, and for star_2, it's n2. Therefore, n1 = 2 * n2.

Assuming that the ground state is much more populated, perhaps the ratio g_i/g_j is 1, unless there's a degeneracy difference. But the question doesn't say anything about that, so maybe I can assume g_i = g_j. So the equation simplifies to n1/n2 = exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), where ΔE is the energy difference.

Wait wait, wait. Wait, the ratio is (n_i)/(n_j) = exp( - (E_i - E_j)/(k T) ). Here, for each star, the ratio is n1/n2 = 2/1. But wait, for each star, the same energy levels are compared. So for star 1, n1_1 / n1_2 = 2, and for star 2, n2_1 / n2_2 = let's say r.

Wait no, maybe I should think in terms of each star's own ratio. Because for each star, the same energy levels are being compared. So for star 1, the excited level is n1 and the lower is n1_lower. For star 2, it's n2 and n2_lower. But maybe the lower level is the same in both cases, but I think the correct approach is to set up the ratios for each star.

Wait, perhaps the problem is just comparing the populations for each star. So the ratio of excited to lower state (for each star) is n_i / n_j = exp( -ΔE/(k T) ) for each star.

So for star 1, n1_excited / n1_lower = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

For star 2, n2_excited / n2_lower = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

But the question says in star_1, the excited level is twice as much as in star_2. Wait, does that mean n1_excited / n2_excited = 2? Or n1_excited / n2_lower = 2? Hmm, the wording is: "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So I think it's n1_excited / n2_excited = 2. So, the excited level of star_1 is twice as populated as that of star_2.

Wait, no, that might not be right. Because the question says, "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So perhaps it's the ratio of the excited state to the ground state? Or maybe it's the ratio of the excitation (i.e., the fraction in the excited state) between the two stars.

Wait, let me think again. The problem states that the excitation in star_1 is twice that of star_2. So for each star, the ratio of excited atoms to some other state (maybe the ground state) is different. Oh, but if the stars are in LTE, then the population ratio depends on temperature. So maybe the ratio is higher for star_1, meaning it's hotter.

Wait, perhaps the ratio (n_i / n_j) for each star is given. For star 1, that ratio is 2, and for star 2, it's let's say something else.

Wait, but the problem states that the energy difference is the same for both stars, because it's the same energy level difference. So ΔE is the same for both.

So, for star_1: n1_i / n1_j = (g_i/g_j) exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2.

For star_2: n2_i / n2_j = (g_i/g_j) exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) = x.

Wait, but the problem says that in star_1, the excitation is twice that of star_2. Hmm, maybe I should think that the ratio for star_1 is 2 times the ratio for star_2. So:

n1_i/n1_j = 2 * (n2_i/n2_j )

So, (g_i/g_j) exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 * (g_i/g_j) exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Assuming that g_i/g_j is the same for both stars (since it's the same transition), then we can write:

exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Taking natural logs of both sides:

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) - ΔE/(k T2)

Rearranging:

ΔE/(k T2) - ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2)

Factor out ΔE/(k):

ΔE/(k) [ 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ] = ln(2)

Hmm, okay, but the options don't have this form. Let me see.

Alternatively, perhaps I should divide the two equations. Let me take the ratio of the two equations for star_1 and star_2.

For star_1: ratio1 = (n1_i)/(n1_j) = 2.

For star_2: ratio2 = (n2_i)/(n2_j).

But the question says that in star_1, the excitation is twice that of star_2. Wait, I'm a bit confused about what exactly is being compared. Let me read the question again.

"iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2."

Ah, perhaps it's that the number of excited atoms in star_1's specific energy level is twice that in star_2's. So, n1 = 2 * n2.

Wait, but n1 and n2 are the populations in the same energy level? Or is n1 the excited state of star_1 and n2 the excited state of star_2?

I think it's the former, that n1 is the number in the excited state of star_1, and n2 is the number in the same excited state of star_2. So the ratio n1/n2 = 2.

So for each star, the ratio of the excited level to the lower level is given by their respective Boltzmann factors.

So for star_1: n1 / n1_lower = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

For star_2: n2 / n2_lower = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

But the question states that n1 = 2 * n2.

Wait, but n1 and n2 are the populations of the same energy level in each star. Hmm, that seems a bit confusing. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the ratio of the excited state to the ground state. So, for star_1, the ratio is R1 = n1_excited / n1_ground = 2 * (n2_excited / n2_ground) = 2 R2.

So R1 = 2 R2.

Then, R1 = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

R2 = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

So R1 = 2 R2.

Thus,

exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Taking the natural log of both sides:

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) - ΔE/(k T2 )

Rearranging:

ΔE/(k T2) - ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2)

Factor out ΔE/(k):

ΔE/(k) [ 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ] = ln(2)

Hmm, can I manipulate this equation further? Let's see:

ΔE/(k) [ (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ) ] = ln(2)

So,

ΔE/(k) * (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

But the options don't have this form. Let me look at the options.

The options are:

A) ln(2) = T2 / T1

B) ln(2) = (T1 + T2)/(T1 T2)

C) ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)^2 )

D) ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

Hmm. In the equation I derived, I have (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) as part of the left side, but multiplied by ΔE/(k). So to get ln(2), I need to have (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = [ ln(2) * k ] / ΔE.

Wait, but the options don't have a ΔE term. So perhaps I made a wrong assumption. Alternatively, perhaps the problem states that the energy difference is the same, and we can proceed without considering its specific value. Let me think again.

Wait, the given ΔE is 1.38e-23 J. Hmm, but that's the same as k_B (Boltzmann constant) times 1.38e-23 J / (k_B) = 1.38e-23 / (1.38e-23) ) = 1. So perhaps ΔE = k_B * 1, which is a convenient number.

Wait, the Boltzmann constant k is approximately 1.38e-23 J/K. So if ΔE is 1.38e-23 J, then ΔE = k * 1 K. So ΔE/(k) = 1 K.

So in my equation earlier, I have:

ΔE/(k) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2 )

But since ΔE/(k) is 1, it's:

( T1 - T2 ) / ( T1 T2 ) = ln(2 )

Which can be rewritten as:

ln(2) = ( T1 - T2 ) / ( T1 T2 )

Looking at the options, option D is:

ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1*T2 )

So option D would be correct.

Wait, but let me make sure. Let me retrace the steps.

We had for each star:

n_i/n_j = exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

For star_1, n1 = 2 * n2.

Wait, no. Wait, I thought n1 is the excited state population of star_1, n2 is the excited state of star_2.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Because n1 and n2 would be in the same energy level but different stars. So perhaps the ratio is not 2, but the ratio of the excited state in star_1 to the same in star_2 is 2. But I'm a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of excited atoms in star_1 is twice that in star_2, but in the same energy level. So n1 = 2 n2.

But then, for each, the ratio of excited to lower is exp(-ΔE/(k T)).

So for star_1, n1_lower = n1 / exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

Similarly, for star_2, n2_lower = n2 / exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

But the problem states that n1 = 2 n2.

But without knowing the lower state population, perhaps I can't proceed that way. Alternatively, perhaps the ratio of the excited to lower state is what's given as twice.

Wait, the question states that the excitation is twice as much in star_1. So perhaps (n_i/n_j)_1 = 2 * (n_i/n_j)_2.

Which leads to:

exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Which is what I had earlier.

So, with ΔE = k * 1 K, because ΔE =1.38e-23 J is exactly k (since k=1.38e-23 J/K), so ΔE/k = 1 K.

So, substituting, the equation becomes:

( T1 - T2 )/( T1 T2 ) ) = ln(2 )

Which is the same as option D.

So the correct equation is ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

So the answer is D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves determining the relationship between the effective temperatures of two stars (star_1 and star_2) based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. The problem states that the excitation in star_1 is twice that of star_2, and the energy difference between the considered energy levels is given as \( \Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \). The photospheres are assumed to be in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), allowing the use of the Boltzmann equation:

\[
\frac{n_i}{n_j} = \frac{g_i}{g_j} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right),
\]

where \( n_i \) and \( n_j \) are the populations of the excited and lower energy states, \( g_i \) and \( g_j \) are their degeneracies, \( k \) is the Boltzmann constant, and \( T \) is the temperature.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Ratio of Excitation**: The excitation in star_1 is twice that of star_2, meaning:
   \[
   \frac{n_{1,\text{excited}}}{n_{1,\text{lower}}} = 2 \cdot \frac{n_{2,\text{excited}}}{n_{2,\text{lower}}}.
   \]

2. **Boltzmann Equation for Each Star**:
   - For star_1:
     \[
     \frac{n_{1,\text{excited}}}{n_{1,\text{lower}}} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right).
     \]
   - For star_2:
     \[
     \frac{n_{2,\text{excited}}}{n_{2,\text{lower}}} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right).
     \]

3. **Equating the Ratios**:
   Substituting the ratio of excitation, we get:
   \[
   \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right) = 2 \cdot \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right).
   \]

4. **Simplifying the Equation**:
   Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:
   \[
   -\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1} = \ln(2) - \frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}.
   \]
   Rearranging:
   \[
   \frac{\Delta E}{k T_2} - \frac{\Delta E}{k T_1} = \ln(2).
   \]

5. **Factoring Out \( \Delta E / k \)**:
   \[
   \frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right) = \ln(2).
   \]

6. **Simplifying Further**:
   The Boltzmann constant \( k \) and the energy difference \( \Delta E \) are related by \( \Delta E = k \cdot 1 \, \text{K} \), so \( \Delta E / k = 1 \). Substituting this:
   \[
   \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} = \ln(2).
   \]

7. **Matching with Options**:
   The derived equation matches **Option D**, which states:
   \[
   \ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
   \]

### Conclusion:
The correct equation for the effective temperatures of the stars is given by Option D.
