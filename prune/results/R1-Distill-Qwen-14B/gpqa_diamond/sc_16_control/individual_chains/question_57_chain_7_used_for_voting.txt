Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about elastic scattering of electrons from a nuclear target. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think through it step by step.

The question gives me some phase shifts: δ0 is 90 degrees, δ1 is 67, δ2 is 55, δ3 is 30, and δ4 is 13 degrees. I'm supposed to ignore the rest of the phase shifts beyond δ4. The electrons are 50 MeV, and I need to calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. The options are A to D, all in units of fm.

Wait, scattering amplitude... I remember that in scattering theory, the scattering amplitude f(θ, φ) can be expressed in terms of the partial waves. Oh right, the partial wave expansion! The scattering amplitude is a sum over all l of (2l+1) times some terms involving the phase shifts δ_l.

The formula for f(θ, φ) is a sum from l=0 to infinity of (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} (sinθ)^l [ (e^{iδ_l} - 1) / (2l+1) ) ]? Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing it up. Let me think again.

Oh right, the scattering amplitude f is given by:

f(θ, φ) = ∑_{l=0}^∞ (2l + 1) e^{2iδ_l} P_l(cosθ) e^{iφ}

Wait, no, that's not exactly it. Another way: I think the amplitude is f = (1/k) ∑ (2l+1) (sinθ)^l [ (e^{iδ_l} - 1) ] e^{i(φ)} 

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me look it up in my notes.

Oh wait, I'm supposed to remember. So the scattering amplitude f is given by:

f(θ, φ) = (1/(2ik)) ∑_{l=0}^∞ (2l + 1) e^{iδ_l} (e^{2iδ_l} - 1) P_l(cosθ) e^{iφ}

Wait, no, that can't be right. Alternatively, perhaps the amplitude is expressed as:

f(θ, φ) = (1/k) ∑_{l=0}^∞ (2l + 1) e^{iδ_l} sin^{l+1}θ [ (e^{iδ_l} - 1) ]

Wait, I'm not sure. Maybe I should think about the imaginary part specifically. Because the problem asks for the imaginary part along the incident beam direction.

Wait, when the scattering is along the incident direction, that would be when the scattering angle θ is 180 degrees, so the outgoing direction is opposite the incident. Or wait, no, the problem says "along the incident beam direction." Oh, perhaps that means when the scattering angle is 0 degrees, so the electron is scattered in the same direction as the incident beam. So θ = 0 degrees.

Wait, but regardless, the formula for the scattering amplitude f(θ, φ) involves the partial waves. So for each l, the contribution is (2l + 1) e^{iδ_l} (something) multiplied by spherical harmonics or Legendre polynomials.

Wait, another approach: The scattering amplitude can be written as f(θ, φ) = ∑_{l=0}^∞ [ (2l+1) e^{2iδ_l} (e^{iδ_l} - 1) ] (sinθ)^l e^{iφ} / (something). Or maybe it's f = ∑ (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} ( (e^{iδ_l} - 1) ) (sinθ)^l e^{iφ} / ... Hmm, I'm a bit stuck.

Wait, perhaps I should recall that the differential cross-section is given by |f|^2, and it's expressed in terms of the partial waves. The differential cross-section dσ/dΩ is |f|^2, and f can be written as the sum over l of (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} (e^{iδ_l} - 1) (sinθ)^l e^{iφ}.

Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, I think the scattering amplitude f is given by:

f(θ, φ) = (1/(2ik)) ∑_{l=0}^∞ (2l + 1) e^{iδ_l} (e^{2iδ_l} - 1) P_l(cosθ) e^{iφ}

Wait, but I'm not confident about the exact formula. Maybe I should think about the partial wave expansion.

In partial wave expansion, the scattering amplitude is:

f(θ, φ) = (1/k) ∑_{l=0}^∞ (2l + 1) e^{iδ_l} [ (e^{iδ_l} - 1 ) ] sin^{l}θ e^{i l φ }

Wait, that doesn't feel quite right. Alternatively, perhaps it's:

f(θ, φ) = (1/k) ∑_{l=0}^∞ (2l + 1) e^{iδ_l} [ (e^{iδ_l} - 1) ] (sin θ)^{l} e^{i l φ}

Wait, but then for the imaginary part, perhaps I can take the imaginary part of each term.

But the problem states that we're to find the imaginary part along the incident beam direction. So, when θ=0, sinθ=0, so (sinθ)^l would be zero except when l=0. Because sin(0)^0 is 1, sin(0)^1 is 0, etc. So for l>0, (sinθ)^l is zero, so the only term contributing is l=0.

Wait, but wait, if θ=0, then the point is directly along the beam. So the scattering amplitude's imaginary part along the beam direction would be dominated by the l=0 term.

Wait, so let's compute the contribution from l=0. So for l=0:

(2*0 +1) = 1.

e^{iδ_0} = e^{i π/2} because δ_0 is 90 degrees, which is π/2 radians.

(e^{iδ_0} -1 ) = e^{i π/2} -1 = i -1 = (-1 + i).

So the term for l=0 is 1 * e^{i π/2} * (e^{i π/2} -1) * (sin θ)^0 * e^{i l φ}.

Wait, (sinθ)^0 is 1, and e^{i l φ} is e^{0} =1.

So the term is (e^{i π/2} ) * (e^{i π/2} - 1 ) = (i) * (i -1) = i^2 -i = (-1) -i.

So the amplitude f is (1/k) multiplied by this term. So f = (1/k) [ (-1 -i ) ].

Wait, but what's k? Since the electrons are 50 MeV, we can compute k from their momentum. Wait, the Compton wavelength is involved here, perhaps.

Wait, the wave number k is given by k = (sqrt( (E)^2 - (m c^2)^2 )) / (ħ c )

Wait, but E here is 50 MeV. The electron mass is about 0.511 MeV, so E >> m c^2. So we can approximate k ≈ E/(ħ c), but let me confirm the exact formula.

Alternatively, the momentum p is given by p = sqrt( E^2 - (m c^2)^2 ) / c^2 * c = sqrt( E^2 - (m c^2)^2 ) / c.

Wait, maybe it's easier to compute k in terms of E.

k = p/(ħ) = (sqrt( E^2 - (m c^2)^2 )/(c^2)) ) / ħ

Wait, but perhaps a better approach is to compute using known constants.

Alternatively, the Compton wavelength of the electron is λ_c = h/(m_e c) ≈ 2.426 × 10^-12 m, or about 2.426 fm. Wait, 1 fm is 1e-15 m, so 2.426e-12 m is 2426 fm. Wait, no, wait, 1e-12 m is 1 picometer, not femtometer. Oh wait, 1 fm is 1e-15 meters, so 2.426e-12 m is 2426 fm? No, wait: 1e-12 m is 1 picometer, which is 1000 fm. So 2.426e-12 m = 2.426 pm = 2426 fm? Wait, that can't be right. Let me get the numbers correct.

Wait, the Compton wavelength λ_c is h/(m_e c), which is approximately 2.426 × 10^-12 meters. So 2.426e-12 m is 2.426e-3 picometers, which is 2.426 femtometers. Because 1 picometer is 1e-12 m, so 2.426e-12 m is 2.426 pm, which is 2426 fm? Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait: 1 m = 1e15 femtometers. So 1e-12 m is 1e3 femtometers. So 2.426e-12 m equals 2.426e3 femtometers, which is 2426 fm. No, wait, 1e-15 m is 1 fm. So 1e-12 is 1e3 fm. So 2.426e-12 m is 2426 fm. Oh, that's a big number.

Wait, but perhaps when computing k, we can use k = E/(ħ c) for high-energy electrons where E ≫ m c^2. Because for 50 MeV electrons, which is much higher than 0.511 MeV, the approximation E ≈ p c holds.

So E = 50 MeV, and ħ c is about 197.33 MeV fm. Because ħ c ≈ 197.33 MeV fm. So k = E/(ħ c) = 50 / 197.33 ≈ 0.253 fm^-1.

Wait, wait: E is in MeV, and ħ c is in MeV fm. So 50 MeV / (197.33 MeV fm) = (50/197.33) fm^-1 ≈ 0.253 fm^-1.

So k ≈ 0.253 fm^-1.

So going back to the f calculation for l=0.

f = (1/k) * [(-1) - i ] 

So f = (1/0.253 fm^-1) * (-1 -i) 

Which is (1/0.253) * (-1 -i) fm.

Calculate 1/0.253: approximately 3.9526... So 3.9526 * (-1 -i) = (-3.9526 - 3.9526i) fm.

So the scattering amplitude f has a real part and an imaginary part. But the question asks for the imaginary part along the incident direction. Wait, but the problem says to calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. So the Im(f) is the coefficient of the imaginary unit, which is -3.9526.

Wait, but wait, how does this relate to the options given? The options are in the range of about 13 to 87,163 fm. So my calculation gives Im(f)= -3.95 fm, but that's not among the options. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the partial wave expansion formula. Let me think again.

Another approach: The scattering amplitude f for elastic scattering can be written as f(θ, φ) = ∑_{l=0}^∞ (2l + 1) (e^{iδ_l} - 1) (sinθ)^l e^{i l φ}.

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps f is (1/k) times that sum.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is f(θ, φ) = (1/k) ∑_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) (e^{i δ_l} - 1) (sinθ)^l e^{i l φ}.

If that's the case, then along the incident beam direction, θ=0 degrees, so sinθ=0, so (sinθ)^l is zero for l>0. Only l=0 contributes.

So for l=0, (sinθ)^0 = 1, and e^{i l φ} = e^0=1.

So f(0, φ) = (1/k) * (2*0+1) * (e^{i δ_0} - 1) * 1 * 1.

Which is (1/k) * (1) * (e^{i π/2} - 1) = (1/k) * (i -1).

So f has a real part Re(f) = (-1)/k and Im(f) = (1)/k.

Wait, because (i -1) can be written as (-1 + i), so Re(f) is (-1/k), Im(f) is (1/k).

So Im(f) = 1/k.

Wait, that's a crucial point. So the imaginary part is 1/k.

We calculated k as approximately 0.253 fm^-1, so Im(f) = 1/(0.253) ≈ 3.9526 fm. But looking at the options, the closest is option B, C, or D in the 177 or 251 range. Hmm, something's wrong here because my calculation gives about 4 fm, but the options are up to 87k.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the formula for f. Another possibility is that the formula for f includes a factor of (2l+1), and perhaps the sum is multiplied by (e^{iδ_l} -1). Alternatively, perhaps I missed a factor.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is f(θ, φ) = (1/(2ik)) ∑_{l=0}^∞ (2l +1) e^{2i δ_l} (e^{i δ_l} - 1) P_l(cos θ) e^{i l φ}.

Wait, but then for θ=0, P_l(1) is 1 for l=0, and zero for l>0 because P_l(1)=1 for l=0, and zero for l>0.

So only l=0 term remains. So f(0, φ) = (1/(2ik)) * (2*0+1) * e^{2i δ_0} (e^{i δ_0} - 1) * 1 * e^{i*0}.

Which is (1/(2ik)) * 1 * e^{i π} (e^{i π/2} -1) * 1.

Wait, δ0 is 90 degrees, so e^{i δ0}= e^{i π/2} = i.

So e^{2i δ0} = e^{i π} = -1.

(e^{i δ0} -1 ) = i -1 = -1 +i.

So putting it together:

f(0, φ) = (1/(2ik)) * (-1) * (-1 +i) * 1.

= (1/(2ik)) * (1 -i )

= (1 -i) / (2ik )

= [ (1 -i ) ] / (2ik )

Hmm, but then let's compute 1/(2ik ) = -i/(2k ), since 1/(2ik ) = -i/(2k ).

So substituting:

(1 -i ) * (-i/(2k )) 

= [ (1)(-i) - i*(-i) ] / (2k )

= [ (-i) + (i^2) ] / (2k )

= [ (-i) -1 ] / (2k )

So f = [ (-1 -i ) ] / (2k )

So the imaginary part of f is the coefficient of i, which is (-1)/(2k ).

But the question asks for the imaginary part, Im(f) = (-1)/(2k ).

Wait, but I'm not sure if this is correct. Alternatively, perhaps I should separate real and imaginary parts.

Wait, f = [ (-1 -i ) ]/(2k )

So real part is (-1)/(2k ), imaginary part is (-1)/(2k ) * (-1) ?

Wait, no, f = [ (-1)(1) + (-1)(i) ]/(2k ) = [ -1/(2k) ) ] - [ i/(2k) ) ]

So the real part is -1/(2k ), and the imaginary part is -1/(2k ). 

Wait, so Im(f) = -1/(2k )

But then in terms of magnitude, the imaginary part is a negative value, but the options are positive.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the signs. Let me recheck.

Wait, from earlier step:

f(0, φ) = (1/(2ik)) * (-1) * (i -1 )

= (1/(2ik)) * (-1)(i -1 )

= (1/(2ik)) * (1 -i )

= [1 -i ] / (2ik )

Multiply numerator and denominator by -i to rationalize denominator:

= [ (1 -i ) (-i) ] / (2k )

= [ (-i + i^2 ) ] / (2k )

= [ (-i -1 ) ] / (2k )

So f = [ (-1 -i ) ]/(2k )

So f's real part is (-1)/(2k ), and its imaginary part is (-1)/(2k ).

So Im(f) = -1/(2k )

Wait, but the magnitude would be 1/(2k ), regardless of sign.

But the options are positive numbers, so perhaps the magnitude is 1/(2k ), which is (1/(2 * 0.253 )) fm ≈ (1/(0.506 )) ≈ 1.976 fm. But again, this isn't matching any of the options.

Hmm, I'm getting a value of about 2 fm for Im(f), but the options are much larger. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula for f.

Wait, let me think again. Another approach is to consider the optical theorem. The total cross-section is related to the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude.

The optical theorem states that σ_total = (4π/k^2) Im(f(0,0)).

So Im(f) = (k^2/(4π)) * σ_total.

But wait, I don't know σ_total, so maybe that's not helpful here.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about the imaginary part of the partial wave amplitude, not the full scattering amplitude.

Wait, another thought. The scattering amplitude f is given by:

f = 1/(k) ∑_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} (e^{i δ_l} - 1 ) (sinθ)^l e^{i l φ}

So for θ=0, sinθ=0, so only l=0 term contributes.

So f = (1/k) * (2*0 +1) e^{i δ0} (e^{i δ0} - 1 ) * 1 * 1

So f = (1/k) * 1 * e^{i π/2} (e^{i π/2} -1 )

e^{i π/2} is i, so e^{i π/2} -1 = i -1 = -1 +i.

So f = (1/k) * i * (-1 + i )

= (1/k) * [ (-i) + i^2 ]

= (1/k) * [ (-i) -1 ]

So f= [ (-1) -i ] /k 

So the real part is (-1)/k and the imaginary part is (-1)/k.

So Im(f) = -1/k.

But since the magnitude is positive, perhaps the answer is 1/k.

So 1/k = 1/(0.253 ) ≈ 3.95 fm.

But the options don't match this. I'm getting confused because my calculation doesn't align with any of the options.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k. Let me re-calculate k.

E = 50 MeV.

The mass of the electron is m_e c^2 = 0.511 MeV.

So the kinetic energy is much larger than the rest mass, so we can approximate E ≈ p c.

So p = E / c = 50 MeV / c.

But ħ c is approximately 197.33 MeV fm.

So k = p / ħ = (50 MeV / c ) / (197.33 MeV fm / ħ c )

Wait, let me re-calculate k.

k = p / ħ = (E / c ) / ħ

But in terms of units, 1 MeV fm / (ħ c ) = 1/(197.33) because ħ c ≈197.33 MeV fm.

So E = 50 MeV, so k = (50 MeV / c ) / (ħ c ) * (1 fm / (ħ c )) ?

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute in terms of ħ c.

k = E/(ħ c )

So E = 50 MeV, ħ c = 197.33 MeV fm.

So k = 50 / 197.33 ≈ 0.253 fm^-1.

So 1/k is approximately 3.95 fm.

But again, the options are much bigger.

Wait, perhaps I missed a factor of 2 somewhere.

Wait, in the partial wave expansion, perhaps the formula includes a 1/(2ik) factor. Let me see:

If the formula for f is f = (1/(2ik)) ∑ ... then when l=0, the term would be (2*0 +1) e^{i δ0} (e^{i δ0} -1 )

So f = (1/(2ik)) * (1) * e^{i π/2} (e^{i π/2} -1 )

= (1/(2ik)) * i (i -1 )

= (1/(2ik)) * (i^2 -i )

= (1/(2ik)) * (-1 -i )

= ( (-1 -i ) ) / (2ik )

So, f = [ (-1 -i ) ] / (2ik )

Then, the imaginary part of f is the coefficient of i in the numerator.

Wait, let's separate into real and imaginary parts.

Multiply numerator and denominator by -i:

= [ (-1 -i ) * (-i) ] / (2k )

= [ (i + i^2 ) ] / (2k )

= [ i -1 ] / (2k )

So f = ( -1 + i )/( 2k )

So real part is (-1)/(2k ), imaginary part is 1/(2k ).

So Im(f) = 1/(2k ) = 1/(2 * 0.253 ) ≈ 1/(0.506 ) ≈ 1.976 fm.

Still, that's not matching any of the options. The only option close is option B, which is 355.35 fm, but that's an order of magnitude higher.

Wait, perhaps I made an error in the formula for f. Another approach: perhaps the amplitude is given by f = ∑_{l=0}^∞ (2l +1) (e^{i δ_l} - 1) (sinθ)^l e^{i l φ}.

In that case, for θ=0, only l=0 contributes.

So f = (1) (e^{i δ_0} - 1) * 1 * 1 = e^{i π/2} -1 = i -1.

So Im(f) = Re( (i -1) )? No, wait, (i -1) is a complex number with Re= -1, Im=1.

Wait, but the problem says to calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude. So Im(f) is 1.

But again, that's much smaller than the options.

Wait, perhaps the formula includes a factor of 1/k. So f = (1/k) (2l +1) (e^{i δ_l} -1 ) (sinθ)^l e^{i l φ}.

In that case, for l=0 and θ=0, f = (1/k) (1) (i-1) (1) (1) = (i-1)/k.

So Im(f) is (1)/k ≈ 3.95 fm.

Still not matching any options. I'm stuck. Maybe I need to think differently.

Wait, perhaps the formula for the scattering amplitude is f = (1/k) ∑ (2l+1) e^{2i δ_l} (sinθ)^l e^{i l φ}.

Wait, but that doesn't seem right. Or perhaps it's f = (1/k) ∑ (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} (e^{i δ_l} -1) (sinθ)^l e^{i l φ}.

In any case, the key point is that for θ=0, only l=0 contributes, and the imaginary part is 1/k.

But why are the options so much larger?

Wait, perhaps the phase shifts are given in degrees, but I've been treating them as radians. Oh, wait! Oh no! That's a big mistake.

In the calculation, I converted δ_0 =90 degrees to π/2 radians, but if I'm using the exponential function e^{iδ_l}, I should use radians. But in the above calculations, I did use radians correctly. Oh, but perhaps the phase shifts are in degrees, so the actual phase shift in radians is δ_l * π/180.

Wait, but in the calculation of e^{i δ_l}, the exponent should be in radians. So when I took δ_0=90 degrees, I correctly converted it to π/2 radians. So that part was correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the value of k. Let me recheck.

E =50 MeV, m_e c^2=0.511 MeV. So E>>m_e c^2, so k ≈ E/(ħ c).

ħ c = 197.33 MeV fm.

So k = 50 / 197.33 ≈ 0.253 fm⁻¹.

1/k ≈ 3.95 fm.

But the options are way larger. So maybe I'm missing a factor. Wait, perhaps the formula for f is f = (1/k) (2l+1) [e^{i δ_l} (e^{i δ_l} -1 ) ] (sinθ)^l e^{i l φ}.

So for l=0, f=(1/k) (1) (e^{i π/2} (e^{i π/2} -1 )) )

Which is (1/k) (i (i-1 )) = (1/k) (i^2 -i )= (1/k)(-1 -i )

So Im(f) is (-1/k ), but the magnitude is 3.95 fm.

Still not matching options.

Wait, perhaps the phase shifts given include all the contributions up to l=4. But what about when θ=0, which only includes l=0.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the question is asking for the imaginary part of the total scattering amplitude, which is the sum of all the partial waves. But no, when θ=0, only l=0 contributes.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Let me think about the options. The options are all in the 100s or thousands of femtometers. My calculation is about 4 fm, but none of the options are near that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k.

Wait, perhaps the energy is 50 GeV instead of 50 MeV? But the question says 50 MeV.

Alternatively, perhaps I confused 1 fm⁻¹ with 1 fm. Wait, no, because k is in fm⁻¹, so 1/k is in fm.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for f is f = (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} (e^{i δ_l} -1 ) (sinθ)^l e^{i l φ}.

In that case, without the 1/k factor. Then for l=0, f = (1) e^{i π/2} (e^{i π/2} -1 ) = i (i-1 )= i^2 -i = -1 -i.

So Im(f)= -1.

Which is not matching any option either.

Wait, maybe the question is asking for the imaginary part multiplied by something else. Alternatively, perhaps the phase shifts are summed differently.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for the scattering amplitude is:

f = (1/k) ∑_{l=0}^∞ (2l +1) [ e^{i δ_l} (e^{i 2 δ_l} -1) ] (sinθ)^l e^{i l φ}.

Wait, for l=0, it becomes (1/k) (1) (e^{i δ_0} (e^{i 2 δ_0} -1 ) ) * 1 *1.

e^{i δ_0} = i, e^{i 2 δ_0}= e^{i π} = -1.

So e^{i δ_0} (e^{i 2 δ_0} -1 ) = i ( (-1) -1 )= i (-2 )= -2i.

So f= (1/k) * (-2i )

Im(f)= -2/(k )

So Im(f) = -2/(0.253 ) ≈ -7.905 fm.

Still, not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps the formula is f = (1/k) ∑_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} (e^{i δ_l} -1 ) (sinθ)^l e^{i l φ}.

So for l=0, f= (1/k) (1) e^{i π/2} (e^{i π/2} -1 ) = (1/k) (i)(i-1 ) = (1/k) (i^2 -i ) = (1/k) (-1 -i )

So Im(f) = (1/k ) (-1 )

Which is -3.95 fm.

Another thought: perhaps the problem is not considering the sum of all the phase shifts but only the last one, or perhaps the order is misread.

Wait, the phase shifts given are δ0=90, δ1=67, δ2=55, δ3=30, δ4=13. So ignoring beyond δ4, but for θ=0, only l=0 contributes, so the other phase shifts don't matter.

Wait, perhaps the problem is not about the scattering amplitude along the incident direction but in another direction, but the question says 'along the incident beam direction', which is θ=0 degrees.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for f includes a factor of (2l+1) in the sum, but I'm not including it correctly.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude is given by the sum of (2l+1) times sinθ^{l} times sinδ_l, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the imaginary part of f is given by the sum over l of (2l+1) (sinθ)^l (sin δ_l ), multiplied by some other factors.

Alternatively, perhaps the imaginary part is given by (2l+1) (sinθ)^l sin δ_l, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the general expression for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude. From what I recall, the imaginary part of f(θ=0) is given by (1/k) times the sum of (2l+1) times sin δ_l times (sin 0)^l, but since sin0=0 for l>0, only l=0 contributes.

For l=0, sin0^0=1, so Im(f) = (1/k) (2*0+1) sin δ_0 = (1/k) (1) sin(90 degrees ) = (1/k) (1)(1) = 1/k ≈ 3.95 fm.

But again, this is not matching any of the options. So perhaps I'm missing a factor.

Alternatively, the amplitude could be 2l+1 times something, so for l=0, it's 1.

Wait, perhaps the formula for Im(f) is (1/k) * (2l+1) * sin δ_l.

So for l=0, Im(f) = (1/k) *1 * sin(90) = 1/k ≈ 3.95 fm.

Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps the phase shifts are given in degrees, and I'm using radians in the formulae, but in the exponent e^{i δ_l}, δ_l should be in radians. So no, that wasn't the problem.

Another thought: perhaps the formula for f includes a factor of (e^{2i δ_l} -1 ), but that's where I thought I was earlier.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k.

Wait, let me compute k more accurately.

E = 50 MeV.

ħ c = 197.327 MeV fm.

k = E / ħ c = 50 / 197.327 ≈ 0.2531 fm⁻¹.

So 1/k ≈ 3.952 fm.

Hmm. Wait, perhaps the formula includes a factor of (2l+1) outside, but when l=0, it's 1, so no change.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the magnitude of the imaginary part, but that doesn't change the result.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the scattering amplitude is calculated using the partial wave contribution, and the imaginary part is the sum over l of (2l+1) times Im(e^{i δ_l}) times (sinθ)^l.

Wait, Im(e^{i δ_l})= sin δ_l.

So for θ=0, only l=0 contributes.

Im(f) = (2*0 +1) sin δ_0 = 1 * 1 = 1.

But that's much smaller than the options.

Wait, perhaps the formula is Im(f) = (1/k) (2l+1) sin δ_l.

So for l=0, Im(f) = (1/k) (1)(1)= 3.95 fm.

Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering all the phase shifts, but when θ=0, only l=0 matters. So all the other phase shifts don't contribute.

Hmm, but the options are much larger. I'm missing something here.

Wait, perhaps the phase shifts are in the form of e^{2i δ_l}, not e^{i δ_l}.

Wait, no, the standard partial wave expansion uses e^{i δ_l}.

Wait, perhaps the formula is f = (1/k) ∑_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} (e^{-i δ_l} -1 ) (sinθ)^l e^{i l φ}.

Wait, that would change the calculation. Let's try that.

For l=0, f= (1/k) (1) e^{i π/2} (e^{-i π/2} -1 ) = (1/k) i [ (e^{-i π/2} -1 ) ].

e^{-i π/2} = cos(-π/2) + i sin(-π/2) = 0 -i = -i.

So e^{-i π/2} -1 = -i -1 = - (1 + i )

So f= (1/k) i [ - (1 +i ) ] = (1/k) i (-1) (1 +i )

= (1/k) (-i) (1 +i )

= (1/k) [ -i - i^2 ]

= (1/k) [ -i +1 ]

So f= (1/k) (1 -i )

Im(f) = (-1)/k ≈ -3.95 fm.

Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps the formula is f = (1/k) ∑_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) [ e^{i δ_l} (e^{i (δ_l)} -1 ) ] (sinθ)^l e^{i l φ}.

Which brings me back to my initial approach.

I'm stuck. Maybe I'll look for another approach. Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the imaginary part of the partial wave amplitude, not the full scattering amplitude.

Wait, the partial wave amplitude is defined as:

f_l = (2l +1 ) ( e^{i δ_l} -1 ) e^{i δ_l} / (k )

Wait, no, perhaps f_l is ( e^{i δ_l} -1 ), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the partial wave amplitude is f_l = ( e^{i δ_l} -1 ), and the full amplitude is f = ∑_{l} (2l +1) f_l (sinθ)^l e^{i l φ}.

In that case, for θ=0, only l=0 contributes, so f = (2*0 +1) f_0 (sin0)^0 e^{0} = f_0.

So f = f_0 = e^{i δ0} -1 = i -1.

Im(f) =1.

But again, that's not matching the options.

Wait, perhaps the partial wave amplitude is f_l = ( e^{i δ_l} ), and the full amplitude f is the sum over l of (2l+1) f_l (e^{i δ_l} -1 ) (sinθ)^l e^{i l φ}.

So for l=0, f = 1 * (e^{i δ0} -1 ) * 1 * 1 = i-1.

Im(f) =1.

Still no match.

Hmm, given that none of my approaches are leading me to the options, perhaps I'm missing a crucial factor. Another possibility is that the phase shifts are given in a different way, such as in terms of π/2 or another unit.

Wait, another idea: perhaps the phase shifts are given in the form δ_l, and the formula for the imaginary part is (1/k) * (2l+1) * sin(2 δ_l).

Wait, because in some cases, the imaginary part involves a sin(2δ_l) term. Let's test that.

For l=0, sin(2 δ_0) = sin(180 degrees )=0.

Wait, that would make the imaginary part zero, which can't be right.

Hmm, perhaps it's sin(δ_l), which for l=0 is 1.

So Im(f) = (1/k) * (2l+1) * sin δ_0 = (1/k) *1 *1= 3.95 fm.

Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps the formula is Im(f) = (k/ (2i )) (2l+1) (e^{i δ_l} -1 ) (sinθ)^l.

Wait, but for θ=0 and l=0, Im(f) would be (k/(2i )) (1) (e^{i π/2} -1 ) *1.

Which is (k/(2i )) (i-1 ) = [ k (i-1) ] / (2i )

Multiply numerator and denominator by -i:

= [k (i-1)(-i) ] / (2 )

= [k ( -i^2 +i ) ] /2 

= [k (1 +i ) ] / 2 

So Im(f) = [k (1) ] / 2 = k/2 ≈ 0.1265 fm.

Still not matching.

I'm really stuck here. Maybe I should try to think about the options. The options are:

A) 87163.4 fm

B) 355.351 fm

C) 177.675 fm

D) 251.271 fm

All much larger than my calculation. So perhaps I missed a factor of 1e4 or something.

Wait, wait. Let me think about units. Maybe I messed up the units when calculating k.

Because 1 fm is 1e-15 meters.

But in the formula, k is in fm⁻¹, which is 1e15 m⁻¹.

Wait, perhaps I should compute k more carefully.

E =50 MeV.

Compute k in fm⁻¹:

k = E / (ħ c )

ħ c = 197.33 MeV fm.

So k =50 /197.33 ≈ 0.253 fm⁻¹.

So 1/k ≈ 3.95 fm.

But the options are way larger. So perhaps I'm missing a factor of 1e4, which would make 3.95e4 fm = 39500 fm. But that's not an option either.

Wait, perhaps the formula includes a factor of 1e4.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula, and the correct formula for the imaginary part is (1e4/k) ?

Which would give 1e4 * 3.95 ≈ 39500 fm. Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the relation between the scattering amplitude and the cross-section.

The differential cross-section is |f|², and the total cross-section is the integral over all solid angles.

But I'm not sure if that helps here.

Another thought: perhaps the problem is not about the scattering amplitude f, but about the imaginary part of the T-matrix element. The T-matrix element T is related to f by f = (1/(2ik)) T.

So if T is the T-matrix, then Im(T) = 2k Im(f).

So if Im(f)=3.95 fm, then Im(T)= 2k * Im(f) = 2k*(1/k)=2.

But that's also not matching the options.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the imaginary part of the partial wave amplitude, which is (e^{i δ_l} -1 ). For l=0, that's i-1, so Im part is 1.

But that's not matching any options.

I'm stuck. Given that, perhaps the correct approach is to select the option that is about 4 fm, but none of the options are near that. So perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, perhaps the phase shift δ0 is 90 degrees, which is π/2 radians. So in the formula, e^{i δ0}=i. So the imaginary part of f would be 1/k, as I computed earlier.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps I'm missing a factor of 2, making it 2/k = 7.9 fm.

Still, not matching any options.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for f includes a factor of (2l+1) outside, leading to f= (1/k) (2l+1) [ ... ]

So for l=0, that's (1/k) *1 * [ ... ] which brings us back to same result.

Wait, perhaps the problem is not about the scattering of electrons but something else, but the question says electrons.

Alternatively, perhaps the phase shifts are given in a different manner, such as including a factor of 2. But I don't think so.

At this point, I'm not able to reconcile my calculations with the options. Perhaps I should make an educated guess. Given that my calculation gives about 3.95 fm, but the options are much larger, perhaps I'm missing a factor of 1e4, which would make it around 39500 fm, but that's not an option.

Wait, looking back, the options don't have anything near 4 fm. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Another thought: perhaps the imaginary part is the sum of the phase shifts multiplied by some factor.

Wait, if I consider the phase shifts δ0=90, δ1=67, etc. But when θ=0, only l=0 contributes. So perhaps the answer is 1/k, which is about 3.95 fm, but that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps the question is actually about the real part, but the problem says imaginary part.

Alternatively, perhaps the phase shifts are in a different form, such as being multiplied by (2l+1) in some way.

Wait, perhaps the imaginary part is (2l+1) * (e^{i δ_l} -1 ), so for l=0, it's 1*(i-1), Im part is 1.

But that's still not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is Im(f) = (2l+1) * sin(δ_l) * (something).

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is Im(f) = (1/k) * (2l+1) * sin(δ_l) * (sinθ)^l.

For l=0, θ=0, it's (1/k)*1 *1 *1 = 3.95 fm.

Still no match.

Wait, perhaps the phase shifts are given in terms of π/2 or another factor.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the scattering amplitude f is given by:

f = (1/k) ∑_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} (e^{i δ_l} -1 ) (sinθ)^l e^{i l φ}.

So for l=0 and θ=0, f= (1/k) (i)(i-1 ) = (1/k)(-1 -i )

Im(f) is (-1)/k ≈ -3.95 fm.

But the problem asks for the imaginary part, which is -3.95 fm. Since the options are positive, perhaps the magnitude is 3.95 fm. But again, not matching any options.

At this point, I think I might have to concede that I'm not able to find the correct approach, but perhaps the answer is option C: 177.675 fm.

Wait, 177.675 fm is approximately 45.5 times larger than my computed 3.95 fm. 177.675 /3.95 ≈45. But I'm not sure why that factor would come into play.

The problem involves calculating the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude for elastic scattering of 50 MeV electrons from a nuclear target, given the phase shifts $\delta_0 = 90^\circ, \delta_1 = 67^\circ, \delta_2 = 55^\circ, \delta_3 = 30^\circ, \delta_4 = 13^\circ$. The scattering amplitude $f(\theta, \phi)$ is expressed in terms of the partial wave expansion:

\[
f(\theta, \phi) = \sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l+1) e^{i\delta_l} (e^{i\delta_l} - 1) (\sin\theta)^l e^{i l \phi}.
\]

For scattering along the incident beam direction ($\theta = 0^\circ$), only the $l=0$ term contributes because $(\sin\theta)^l = 0$ for $l > 0$. Substituting $l=0$, the scattering amplitude becomes:

\[
f(0, \phi) = (2 \cdot 0 + 1) e^{i\delta_0} (e^{i\delta_0} - 1) = e^{i\delta_0} (e^{i\delta_0} - 1).
\]

Given $\delta_0 = 90^\circ$, we convert this to radians: $\delta_0 = \pi/2$. Using $e^{i\pi/2} = i$, the amplitude becomes:

\[
f(0, \phi) = i (i - 1) = i^2 - i = -1 - i.
\]

The imaginary part of $f$ is the coefficient of $i$, which is $-1$. The magnitude of the imaginary part is therefore $1$.

The wave number $k$ is calculated using the energy $E = 50 \, \text{MeV}$ and $\hbar c = 197.33 \, \text{MeV fm}$:

\[
k = \frac{E}{\hbar c} = \frac{50}{197.33} \approx 0.253 \, \text{fm}^{-1}.
\]

The scattering amplitude $f$ is related to the wave number $k$ by a factor of $1/k$. Thus, the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude is:

\[
\text{Im}(f) = \frac{1}{k} \approx \frac{1}{0.253} \approx 3.95 \, \text{fm}.
\]

This result does not match any of the provided options, which are significantly larger. After extensive consideration of possible errors, including unit conversions, phase shift interpretations, and formula adjustments, the closest plausible answer is **C) 177.675 fm**, though the reasoning for this discrepancy remains unclear.
