Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. The question is about synthesizing a specific compound starting from benzene. The target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me break it down.

First, I need to figure out the structure of the target. Benzene has three substituents: a tert-butyl group at position 2, an ethoxy group at position 1, and a nitro group at position 3. Wait, numbering the benzene ring can be tricky. Let me visualize the benzene ring. Let's imagine position 1 is the ethoxy group, position 2 is the tert-butyl, and position 3 is the nitro. So, it's 1-ethoxy, 2-tert-butyl, 3-nitro benzene.

Now, the question is about the sequence of reactions starting from benzene to get this. The options are A, B, C, D, each giving a series of reactions. I need to determine which sequence correctly builds the substituents in the right order to get the desired product.

I remember that when substituents are added to benzene, the order of addition matters because of directing effects. Benzene is initially activated (electron-rich) and gets deactivated after certain substituents are added, which can change the positions where new substituents attach.

Let me think about the substituents in the target. Ethoxy is an activating group (ortho/para director), t-butyl is a strong activating group (since it's a bulky alkyl group, it's more of an ortho/para director but bulky), and nitro is a deactivating group (meta director).

Wait, but the order in which these groups are introduced will determine the possible positions each substituent can occupy. Let me consider the possible steps:

1. Adding a tert-butyl group: This is usually done via Friedel-Crafts alkylation. But wait, Friedel-Crafts doesn't work with bulky groups easily because the carbocation can be difficult to form. Oh wait, tert-butyl chloride with AlCl3 would be used in Friedel-Crafts alkylation. But wait, wait: Friedel-Crafts is for alkyl halides, but for bulky groups, sometimes it's challenging because the carbocation is too stable but also because the AlCl3 can help generate it. Alternatively, maybe it's better to use a different method, but in the options, I see several steps involving AlCl3 and other reagents.

Wait, but let me think about the substituents. The target has three substituents: ethoxy, t-butyl, and nitro. So, the plan is probably to introduce these in a specific order.

But wait, nitro is a meta director. So if I add nitro after activating groups, it would go meta to them. But if I add nitro earlier, it would direct incoming groups to meta positions.

Alternatively, let's outline the possible steps.

Option 1: Let's try adding the ethoxy group first. Since ethoxy is an activating group, it directs incoming substituents to ortho and para. But then, adding nitro, which is a strong deactivating group, would need to go in a position that's meta to the ethoxy. Wait, but if ethoxy is already present, adding nitro in the meta position would require that nitro is introduced in a position that's meta to ethoxy. But wait, the target has nitro in position 3 relative to ethoxy.

Wait, perhaps the order is to add substituents in the order of activation. For example, adding ethoxy first, then t-butyl, then nitro. But nitro is deactivating, so once added, it would affect where any subsequent groups are added.

Alternatively, maybe the ethoxy group is added last because it's a strong activating group, but once other groups are in place, it's harder. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, another approach: The target has three substituents. Let's think about the order in which they could be added.

Let me consider the substituents:

- t-butyl: alkylation via Friedel-Crafts. But t-butyl is bulky, so maybe that's a later step when the ring is activated.

Wait, Friedel-Crafts requires the benzene ring to be activated because it's an electrophilic substitution. If the ring is deactivated, Friedel-Crafts won't work.

So, we need to plan the steps so that when we introduce the t-butyl group, the ring is still activated. If I add a nitro group early, which is deactivating, that could prevent Friedel-Crafts from working afterward.

Therefore, perhaps the correct order is to add the t-butyl group first, then the ethoxy, and then the nitro. But wait, no, because adding nitro after ethoxy would be difficult if ethoxy is activating but nitro is deactivating.

Alternatively, maybe the nitro is added after the ethoxy? Let me think.

Wait, but the target has nitro in position 3, ethoxy in position 1, and t-butyl in position 2. So, let me imagine the benzene ring. Position 1 is ethoxy, position 2 is t-butyl, position 3 is nitro. So, these are all meta to each other except ethoxy and t-butyl are adjacent (ortho).

Hmm, but how can I get substituents in adjacent positions? Because in benzene, when adding substituents, each new group is directed by the existing substituents.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy and t-butyl are introduced first in such a way that they are adjacent. But for that, the directing effects must allow that.

Let me think about step by step.

Suppose:

1. Add ethoxy group: benzene → ethoxybenzene (anisole). Anisole is activated, directs incoming groups to ortho and para.

2. Then, add t-butyl group. Since ethoxy is activating, the t-butyl would go into ortho or para positions relative to ethoxy. If the t-butyl is added in the para position, then the next substituent (nitro) would have to go into a specific position.

But the target has nitro in position 3 relative to ethoxy (position 1). Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should try to map out each substituent's positions.

Alternatively, perhaps the order is to add the t-butyl first.

1. Friedel-Crafts alkylation with t-butyl chloride: benzene → t-butylbenzene. Now, t-butyl is a strong activating group, so it directs incoming groups to ortho and para.

2. Next, add nitro group. But wait, nitro is a deactivating group. So, in which position would it add relative to t-butyl?

Wait, if I add nitro next, it would go into the meta position relative to t-butyl, because nitration of t-butylbenzene would produce nitro in meta. But then, after adding nitro, which is deactivating, I would need to add the ethoxy group. But ethoxy is an activating group, and if the ring is already deactivated by nitro, Friedel-Crafts won't work for ethoxy (ethoxy can be introduced via nucleophilic substitution, like perhaps through a Williamson ether synthesis, but that usually requires a good leaving group, which isn't present here).

Alternatively, maybe I should add ethoxy after nitro. Wait, but adding ethoxy via electrophilic substitution after nitro is present would be difficult because nitro is deactivating, making the ring less reactive. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a different method, like using a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but that's usually done under harsh conditions and isn't straightforward.

This is getting a bit complicated. Let me think of another approach: considering the substituents' activating and deactivating effects and how they influence the positions where new groups can add.

The target has three substituents: t-butyl (activating), nitro (deactivating), and ethoxy (activating). So, after each substitution, the ring's reactivity and the directing effects change.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is added first. Then, t-butyl via Friedel-Crafts (since ethoxy is activating). Then, nitro is added in a position directed by both ethoxy and t-butyl.

But in that case, the positions would be determined by the strongest director. Ethoxy is a strong activating group, and t-butyl is also activating. But if they're in adjacent positions, how does that affect the next substitution?

Alternatively, I'm not sure. Maybe I should look at the options and see which one fits.

The target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So numbering is:

1: ethoxy

2: t-butyl

3: nitro

Wait, that's in a meta arrangement for ethoxy and nitro (positions 1 and 3 are meta), but t-butyl is in position 2, which is ortho to ethoxy and meta to nitro.

Hmm.

Let me think about the possible sequences.

Option A: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 (Friedel-Crafts) → adds t-butyl group. Then ii) HNO3/H2SO4 (nitration). So after t-butyl is attached, the next step is nitration. Since t-butyl is activating, nitration would occur at the para position, but wait, t-butyl is a strong activating, ortho/para director. So nitration would add nitro in ortho or para positions relative to t-butyl. But now, after nitration, the ring has t-butyl and nitro. Then, step iii) SO3/H2SO4 – that's sulfonation, which is another activating group (but it's a strong deactivating group because of the -SO3H group). Wait, sulfonation adds a sulfonic acid group, which is a strong deactivating, meta-directing group. Then, step iv) NaNO2/HCl – that's diazotization, which is typically done on an aryl amine. But after sulfonation, we have a sulfonic acid group, not an amine. So maybe that's not right. I'm getting confused here.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the steps wrong. Let me try to outline each option.

Option D: The steps are:

i) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration of benzene. So benzene becomes nitrobenzene. But nitro is deactivating, so after this, adding alkyl groups via Friedel-Crafts would be difficult because the ring is deactivated. But step iii) is tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3, which is Friedel-Crafts. So would that work after nitro? I don't think so because nitro is deactivating, so the ring is less reactive. Friedel-Crafts requires an activated ring, so this step might not work. So Option D seems problematic because it starts with nitration, leading to a deactivated ring, making subsequent Friedel-Crafts unlikely.

Option B: Steps are i) t-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → add t-butyl; ii) nitration → add nitro. Since t-butyl is activating, nitro will add in ortho or para. Then iii) Fe/HCl → that's a reduction step, maybe to reduce nitro to amine. Then iv) nitration again? Hmm, but then after nitration, adding another nitro group would be problematic. Maybe not.

Option C: steps are i) t-butyl chloride/AlCl3; ii) SO3/H2SO4 (sulfonation); iii) HNO3/H2SO4 (nitration); iv) Fe/HCl (maybe reduction); v) NaNO2/HCl (diazotization); vi) HNO3/H2SO4 (another nitration?); vii) H3O+/H2O/heat (hydrolysis?); viii) dilute H2SO4; ix) NaOH/EtBr.

Wait, this seems a bit convoluted. Let me think. Sulfonation would add a sulfonic acid group, which is deactivating. Then nitration after that would be difficult because the ring is already deactivated. So maybe this option isn't correct.

Option A: After t-butyl and nitration, then sulfonation, which complicates things.

Hmm, perhaps the correct order is to add ethoxy first, but looking at the options, I don't see any that introduce ethoxy early on. Wait, let's look again.

Looking at the options, I only see steps involving t-butyl alkylation, nitration, sulfonation, Fe/HCl (maybe for reduction or something else), NaNO2/HCl (diazotization), dilute H2SO4 (maybe for acid workup), H3O+ and heat (maybe hydrolysis), and NaOH with EtBr (which is an ethoxy group introduction via an SN2 mechanism, perhaps in an ether synthesis).

Wait, ethoxy group introduction via nucleophilic substitution. Wait, benzene rings can't directly undergo SN2, but perhaps if there's a leaving group attached.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution. But that requires a good leaving group, like a nitro group being reduced to an amino group, then converting to a diazonium salt, and then replacing it with a leaving group. Alternatively, maybe it's better to use a Friedel-Crafts acylation followed by something else, but I'm not sure.

Wait, looking at the options, the ethoxy group is introduced in some steps via NaOH and EtBr. NaOH and EtBr would typically be used for an SN2 reaction, such as in an ether synthesis. For example, if you have a benzene ring with a good leaving group like a tosylate, then you could displace it with an ethoxide ion. But in this case, perhaps the leaving group is introduced earlier.

Wait, perhaps the steps involving NaOH and EtBr are for an ethoxy group substitution, but that requires that in the ring, there's a group that can be replaced by ethoxide.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a Grignard reagent, but that's more for alkyne or ketone additions.

Alternatively, perhaps the sequence is:

1. Introduce t-butyl via Friedel-Crafts.

2. Introduce ethoxy group via Friedel-Crafts acylation? No, because ethoxy is an ether, not an acyl group.

Alternatively, maybe the ethoxy group is added via a nucleophilic substitution after activating the ring with a good leaving group.

Wait, perhaps if we have a nitro group in the ring, it can be converted into an amino group, which can then be turned into a diazonium salt, which can be displaced by an ethoxide ion. But that would require a specific sequence.

Wait, let me think through the steps again.

Suppose the target has t-butyl, ethoxy, and nitro groups. Let me think of the substituents in terms of their order of addition.

Option A's steps:

i) t-butyl via Friedel-Crafts.

ii) nitration → adds nitro group.

iii) sulfonation → adds SO3H group.

iv) NaNO2/HCl → this is for diazotization, but I don't see an amine in the steps before.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the steps wrong. Maybe after nitration, the next step is sulfonation, but that would add a sulfonic acid group, which is deactivating.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps are introducing the ethoxy group via a different method.

Wait, maybe the ethoxy group is introduced via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution. Let's see.

Step vii) in option A is NaOH and EtBr. EtBr is ethyl bromide. NaOH would provide OH- which could deprotonate something, but more likely, in the presence of a good leaving group, it could substitute. So perhaps before this step, there's a leaving group on the ring.

Wait, but the target has an ethoxy group, not a leaving group. So perhaps in the steps, the ethoxy is introduced by substituting a nitro group or something else.

Wait, another approach: the target has an ethoxy group at position 1, which is adjacent to the t-butyl at position 2. So, perhaps the ethoxy and t-butyl are added in a way that they are ortho to each other.

But to do that, when adding the second group, the first group must be an activating group, so that the second group can add in the ortho position.

Let's imagine that the ethoxy group is added first.

1. Benzene → ethoxybenzene via Friedel-Crafts? No, because ethoxy is an ether, and Friedel-Crafts is for alkylation or acylation. Wait, ethoxybenzene isn't directly made via Friedel-Crafts. To make ethoxybenzene (anisole), you can use a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but that's challenging unless the ring is activated.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a coupling reaction, but that's not covered in the given options.

Wait, looking at the options, the only way an ethoxy group is introduced is via step vii) NaOH and EtBr. That suggests an SN2 displacement. So perhaps in the ring, there's a leaving group, like a bromide, which is replaced by ethoxide.

But how does the bromide get there?

Wait, perhaps bromine is introduced via a substitution.

Wait, perhaps the steps involve adding a nitro group, then reducing it to an amine, then making a diazonium salt, then substituting with ethoxide.

Let me think. Suppose:

- Add nitro group first (HNO3/H2SO4).

- Then reduce nitro to amine (Fe/HCl would be for reduction? Wait, Fe/HCl is for dissolving metal reduction, like reducing nitro compounds to amines. So benzene → nitrobenzene → aniline.

- Then, aniline is treated with NaNO2/HCl to form a diazonium salt. Then, substituting with something. But in the target, we have an ethoxy group, so perhaps the diazonium is replaced with an ethoxy group.

Wait, but how? Typically, diazonium salts can be replaced with other groups, like in a Sandmeyer reaction or using a nucleophile. So if the diazonium is in a specific position, then a nucleophilic substitution can introduce the ethoxy group.

But in the target, the ethoxy group is at position 1, which is adjacent to t-butyl. Hmm, perhaps this is getting too convoluted.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is added after the nitro group via a substitution reaction, but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, let's look at the options again.

Option B: Steps are i) t-butyl, ii) nitration, iii) Fe/HCl (reduction), iv) nitration again, which seems odd. Maybe not.

Option C: Steps are i) t-butyl, ii) sulfonate, iii) nitrate, iv) Fe/HCl, v) diazonium, vi) nitrate again, which seems complicated.

Option D: i) nitrate, which deactivates the ring, making Friedel-Crafts tough.

Option A: The steps are i) t-butyl, ii) nitrate, iii) sulfonate, iv) diazonium, v) dilute H2SO4, vi) H3O+/H2O/heat, vii) NaOH and EtBr, viii) Fe/HCl, ix) nitrate again.

Wait, so step vii is NaOH and EtBr, which could be introducing the ethoxy group. How?

Perhaps the ring has a leaving group, like a nitro group or a sulfonate group, which is replaced by ethoxide.

Looking at the steps:

After step iii in option A, the ring has t-butyl, nitro, and sulfonate groups. Then, step iv is NaNO2/HCl, which is diazotization. But where is the amine? Oh wait, maybe the nitro group is reduced first.

Wait, prior steps: after nitration (step ii), then sulfonation (iii). So the ring has t-butyl, nitro, and sulfonate groups. Then step iv is NaNO2/HCl, which is diazotization. But without an amine group, that's confusing.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the target: 2-(t-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.

So, the substituents are in positions 1, 2, and 3. So, the positions are adjacent (1 and 2 are ortho, 2 and 3 are meta?), wait no, positions 1 and 2 are adjacent (ortho), and 2 and 3 are adjacent as well. So, all three substituents are on adjacent carbons, which is a bit unusual.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy and t-butyl are introduced via Friedel-Crafts, then the nitro is introduced in the meta position relative to one of them.

Alternatively, maybe the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution after the ring has a nitro group, but that would require activating the ring for substitution.

Wait, another approach: the ethoxy group is added via an SNAr (nucleophilic aromatic substitution) mechanism. For SNAr, the ring must have strong electron-withdrawing groups (like nitro) to activate the position for substitution.

So, perhaps the steps are:

1. Add nitro group to benzene. But then, the ring is deactivated; can't do Friedel-Crafts anymore.

Wait, that would complicate adding t-butyl and ethoxy.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is added after the t-butyl and ethoxy groups. But nitro is deactivating, so adding it last would require the ring to be in a state that allows its introduction.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is added first, but then you can't add the other groups via Friedel-Crafts.

I think I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the options again.

Looking for the correct order:

- The ethoxy group is introduced via step vii) NaOH and EtBr in some options. So, perhaps before this step, there's a leaving group (like a bromide) in the ring.

Wait, but how is bromide introduced? Maybe via a substitution.

Wait, another possibility: the ethoxy group is introduced via a nucleophilic substitution where a nitro group is converted into a leaving group.

Wait, let's think about option B:

Option B steps:

i) t-butyl alkylation.

ii) nitration.

iii) Fe/HCl → reduces nitro to amine.

iv) nitration again (but that would add another nitro group, which doesn't fit the target).

Hmm, not making much sense.

Option C:

i) t-butyl.

ii) sulfonate.

iii) nitrate.

iv) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine.

v) diazonium salt.

vi) nitrate again.

Not sure.

Option D:

i) nitrate.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine.

iii) t-butyl alkylation (but after nitrate, the ring is deactivated, so Friedel-Crafts won't work).

So, option D is probably incorrect.

Option A:

After t-butyl and nitration, then sulfonate, then diazonium, then H3O+/H2O/heat, then NaOH and EtBr, then Fe/HCl, then nitrate.

Wait, perhaps:

After step ii, the ring has t-butyl and nitro groups.

Step iii: sulfonate, so now it has t-butyl, nitro, and sulfonate.

Step iv: NaNO2/HCl → but on what? If the sulfonate is present, which is a strong deactivating group, but I don't see an amine. Unless one of the other groups is converted to an amine.

Wait, perhaps the nitro group was reduced earlier. Let me follow the steps again.

Option A:

i) t-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → adds t-butyl to benzene.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate → adds nitro group.

iii) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonate → adds SO3H group.

iv) NaNO2/HCl → but we have nitro and sulfonate groups; perhaps the nitro is reduced first. Wait, but in the steps given, step iv comes after sulfonation. So, the nitro group is present, but it's already there.

Wait, maybe step iv is to make a diazonium salt from an amine. But where would the amine come from? Unless the nitro group is reduced earlier.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a step. Let me think: nitro group can be reduced to amine. So, between steps ii and iii in option A, perhaps nitro is reduced to amine. But the steps provided don't show that. So maybe in option A, after step ii, there's a nitro group, which is then reduced before step iv.

Alternatively, perhaps the sequence in option A is:

t-butyl → nitro → sulfonate → reduce nitro to amine → make diazonium → substitute → etc.

But looking at the options, the steps in A don't include a reduction step, except step viii is Fe/HCl, which is a reduction.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Maybe it's better to think of each option's steps and see which one logically leads to the target.

Option C:

i) t-butyl.

ii) sulfonate → adds another group.

iii) nitrate → adds nitro.

iv) Fe/HCl → reduces nitro to amine.

v) NaNO2/HCl → makes diazonium.

vi) nitrate again → but that would add another nitro group.

Hmm, but the target has only one nitro group.

Option B:

i) t-butyl.

ii) nitrate.

iii) Fe/HCl → reduces nitro to amine.

iv) nitrate again → adds another nitro, which is not desired.

So, this seems wrong.

Option A:

After t-butyl and nitro, then sulfonate. Then, steps iv to ix involve making a diazonium salt, treating with H3O+ and heat, then NaOH and EtBr, then Fe/HCl, then nitrate.

Wait, perhaps:

After adding t-butyl and nitro, then sulfonate is added. Then, nitro is reduced to amine (using Fe/HCl, step iv is diazonium but wait, maybe step iv is the reduction of nitro to amine. Wait, no, step iv is NaNO2/HCl, which is diazotization. So, perhaps the nitro group is already present as nitro, and I'm trying to make a diazonium salt from an amine, but where is the amine coming from?

Alternatively, perhaps in option A, the nitro group is reduced to amine in a step not listed. But the steps in option A don't include a reduction step before the diazotization.

Wait, I think I'm stuck. Let me think about the correct order for substituents.

1. The ethoxy group is introduced via NaOH and EtBr. So, that step would replace a leaving group with an ethoxy. So, before that step, the ring must have a leaving group.

2. The leaving group could be a nitro group that was reduced to an amine, then turned into a diazonium salt, which can be replaced. Alternatively, a sulfonate group could be a leaving group.

Wait, but sulfonate groups are generally not good leaving groups unless under strong acidic conditions. But in nucleophilic aromatic substitution, leaving groups are usually halides or nitro groups.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced by substituting a bromide. But how would the bromide get there?

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the target again: 2-(t-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.

So, the substituents are in the 1, 2, and 3 positions. So, the order of addition must be such that each new substituent is directed appropriately.

Let me imagine adding substituents in the order of ethoxy, t-butyl, nitro.

But ethoxy is activating. So, first, ethoxy is added to benzene, making ethoxybenzene. Then, the t-butyl group is added at the para position to ethoxy, but we need it to be ortho. Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, adding t-butyl via Friedel-Crafts would go into ortho or para.

Wait, ethoxy is a strong activating group, so adding t-butyl to ethoxybenzene would go para to ethoxy. But the target has t-butyl in position 2 (ortho to ethoxy). So that wouldn't fit. So perhaps that order isn't right.

Alternatively, perhaps the t-butyl is added first, then ethoxy, then nitro.

After adding t-butyl (which is activating), ethoxy is added in the ortho or para position. Let's say ethoxy is added para to t-butyl. Then, nitro would enter meta to t-butyl, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the nitro is added first, but then it deactivates the ring, making the other substitutions difficult.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is:

1. Add ethoxy group first (but how? Because the options don't have a direct step for that).

Wait, in the options, the only way to add ethoxy is via NaOH and EtBr, which suggests substitution. So perhaps, the ethoxy is added last.

So, perhaps the steps are:

1. Add t-butyl.

2. Add nitro.

3. Add ethoxy via substitution.

So, let's think about that.

After adding t-butyl and nitro, the ring has t-butyl (activating) and nitro (deactivating). The nitro group is meta-directing, but the t-butyl is ortho/para-directing.

So, the ethoxy group would go into a position directed by the existing groups. But since nitro is deactivating, the ring is less reactive, so perhaps the ethoxy is added via a substitution reaction, which is feasible with a good leaving group.

Wait, maybe the nitro group is replaced by ethoxy via some reaction.

But nitro groups are not good leaving groups. Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is reduced to an amine, then converted into a diazonium salt, which is then replaced with ethoxy.

So, the steps would be:

- Add t-butyl.

- Add nitro.

- Reduce nitro to amine.

- Convert amine to diazonium.

- Replace diazonium with ethoxy.

That would introduce the ethoxy group in the position where nitro was, but in the target, nitro is in position 3, and ethoxy is in 1. So maybe that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro is not replaced but is part of the target.

Wait, this is getting really complicated. Let me try to think of the options again.

Looking at option D:

Steps are i) nitrate → ii) Fe/HCl → iii) t-butyl.

Wait, after nitration (i), the ring is nitrobenzene. Then, Fe/HCl would reduce nitro to amine, making aniline. Then, t-butyl via Friedel-Crafts. But wait, after the ring has an amine group, which is activating, the Friedel-Crafts would add the t-butyl in the ortho or para positions relative to the amine.

But the target's t-butyl is in position 2 relative to ethoxy (position 1). So, perhaps if the amine is in position 1, adding t-butyl in position 2 would work. Then, after that, perhaps the amine is converted to nitro.

Wait, but that doesn't fit the target, which has nitro in position 3.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps in option D are:

i) nitrate → nitrobenzene.

ii) reduce nitro to amine → aniline.

iii) Friedel-Crafts alkylation with t-butyl → t-butyl groups attach in ortho or para to amine.

Then, perhaps further steps add ethoxy and nitro again. But the target has only one nitro group.

Hmm, this is getting me nowhere. Maybe I should think of the correct order of substituent addition.

The correct order to get the substituents in positions 1, 2, 3 would likely require that each new group is added in a position that's ortho or meta to the existing groups.

But I'm not making progress quickly. Let me try to outline possible steps:

1. Add ethoxy group (but how? The options only have steps for substitution via NaOH and EtBr).

But perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a nucleophilic substitution. So, for that, the ring must have a leaving group, like a bromide.

But how does a bromide get into the ring?

Wait, perhaps step vii in option A is NaOH and EtBr, which is for introducing ethoxy via SN2. So, the ring must have a bromide in the position where the ethoxy should end up (position 1).

So, perhaps before step vii, there's a bromide in position 1.

How would that bromide get there? Maybe via a substitution reaction.

Wait, perhaps the ring has a nitro group in position 3, which is reduced to an amine, then turned into a diazonium salt, then substituted with ethoxide.

Alternatively, perhaps the bromide is introduced via a coupling reaction, but that's probably beyond the given options.

Alternatively, perhaps the bromide is introduced via a substitution after activating the ring.

Wait, another approach: the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution after the ring has a nitro group in position 1. Then, the nitro is replaced by ethoxy.

But nitro groups are not easily replaced. So, perhaps the nitro is reduced to an amine, then made into a diazonium salt, then substituted with ethoxide.

So, if in the target, the nitro is in position 3, then perhaps the steps would be:

1. Add t-butyl to benzene.

2. Nitrate to add nitro in position 3.

3. Reduce nitro to amine.

4. Diazotize and substitute with ethoxy.

So, the steps would be:

i) t-butyl via AlCl3.

ii) nitrate.

iii) reduce nitro (Fe/HCl) → amine.

iv) diazonium (NaNO2/HCl).

v) substitute with ethoxide (NaOH and EtBr).

But in the options, do any of them have this sequence?

Looking at option B:

i) t-butyl.

ii) nitrate.

iii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine.

iv) nitrate again → which would not fit.

Option C:

i) t-butyl.

ii) sulfonate.

iii) nitrate.

iv) Fe/HCl → reduce.

v) diazonium.

vi) nitrate again.

Not matching.

Option A:

i) t-butyl.

ii) nitrate.

iii) sulfonate.

iv) diazonium.

v) H3O+/H2O/heat → maybe hydrolysis.

vi) NaOH and EtBr → ethoxy substitution.

vii) Fe/HCl → reduce.

viii) dilute H2SO4.

ix) nitrate again.

Hmm, perhaps in option A, after adding t-butyl and nitro, then sulfonate is added, then nitro is reduced to amine, then diazonium, then substitution with ethoxy.

But I'm not sure if that's the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is option A, but I'm not fully confident.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is B, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the target has nitro in position 3. Suppose the ethoxy is in position 1, and t-butyl in 2. So, the ethoxy and t-butyl are adjacent, and nitro is in position 3, which is adjacent to t-butyl.

So, the order of addition could be:

1. Add ethoxy.

2. Add t-butyl in ortho position.

3. Add nitro in position 3, which is meta to ethoxy and adjacent to t-butyl.

But how to add ethoxy first.

Wait, but in the options, the only way to add ethoxy is via substitution. So perhaps the ethoxy is added last.

So, perhaps the steps are:

1. Add t-butyl.

2. Add nitro.

3. Add ethoxy via substitution.

So, let's see which option follows this.

Option A:

i) t-butyl.

ii) nitrate.

Then, steps iii) sulfonate.

iv) diazonium.

v) H3O+/H2O/heat.

vi) NaOH and EtBr → ethoxy.

vii) Fe/HCl.

viii) dilute H2SO4.

ix) nitrate.

So, after adding t-butyl and nitro, they add sulfonate, then make diazonium, then ethoxy via substitution. But I'm not sure if that leads to the correct positions.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is C:

i) t-butyl.

ii) sulfonate.

iii) nitrate.

iv) Fe/HCl → reduce.

v) diazonium.

vi) nitrate.

Hmm, not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is option B.

Option B steps:

i) t-butyl.

ii) nitrate.

iii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine.

iv) nitrate → would add another nitro group, which is not desired.

So, this is probably incorrect.

Option D:

i) nitrate.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduce to amine.

iii) t-butyl via AlCl3.

iv) nitrate.

But after nitration, the ring is deactivated, making Friedel-Crafts unlikely.

So, probably not.

So, after thinking through all options, I think the correct sequence is in option A. Let me go through it step by step:

i) t-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → adds t-butyl group to benzene.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate the t-butylbenzene. Since t-butyl is activating, nitration occurs in ortho or para. Let's say it adds in the para position relative to t-butyl.

Wait, but in the target, nitro is in position 3, which is adjacent to t-butyl. So perhaps it's para to the ethoxy group.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused again. Maybe I should think that after adding t-butyl and nitro, the next step is to add ethoxy via substitution.

In option A, step vii is NaOH and EtBr, which would substitute a bromide with ethoxy. So, before that, the ring must have a bromide in the desired position.

But how to get a bromide there? Let's see the steps in option A:

After step iii, which is sulfonation, the ring has t-butyl, nitro, and sulfonate groups.

Then, step iv is NaNO2/HCl → but without an amine, this doesn't make sense. Unless the nitro group is reduced first. Wait, perhaps step viii is Fe/HCl, which would reduce a nitro group to amine.

Wait, perhaps the steps are:

i) t-butyl.

ii) nitrate → nitro in para to t-butyl.

iii) sulfonate → adds SO3H in another position.

iv) NaNO2/HCl → needs an amine, but nitro is present. So perhaps step iv is after reducing nitro to amine.

Wait, but the steps in option A don't show a reduction step until step viii.

So, this is getting too tangled. I think I've spent enough time, and I need to make an educated guess.

The correct order is likely option A: adding t-butyl, then nitro, then substituting to add ethoxy. So, the answer is A.

The question involves determining the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene. The target molecule has three substituents: a tert-butyl group at position 2, an ethoxy group at position 1, and a nitro group at position 3. The analysis of the options is as follows:

1. **Option A**:  
   - Step i: tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 introduces the tert-butyl group via Friedel-Crafts alkylation.  
   - Step ii: HNO3/H2SO4 introduces the nitro group. Since tert-butyl is an activating group, the nitro group is directed to the para position relative to the tert-butyl group.  
   - Step iii: SO3/H2SO4 introduces a sulfonate group, which is deactivating and meta-directing.  
   - Step iv: NaNO2/HCl forms a diazonium salt, but this step requires an amine group, which is not explicitly shown in the sequence.  
   - Step v: H3O+/H2O/Heat likely involves hydrolysis or workup.  
   - Step vi: NaOH/EtBr introduces the ethoxy group via nucleophilic substitution, replacing a leaving group.  
   - Step vii: Fe/HCl reduces a nitro group to an amine.  
   - Step viii: dilute H2SO4 and Step ix: HNO3/H2SO4 involve further reactions, but these steps seem redundant given the target molecule.  

   This sequence appears to logically introduce the substituents in a manner consistent with the target structure.

2. **Option B**:  
   - Step i: tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 introduces the tert-butyl group.  
   - Step ii: HNO3/H2SO4 introduces the nitro group.  
   - Step iii: Fe/HCl reduces the nitro group to an amine.  
   - Step iv: HNO3/H2SO4 reintroduces the nitro group, which is unnecessary since the target molecule has only one nitro group.  
   - Subsequent steps (v–ix) involve additional transformations, but the sequence is inconsistent with the target structure.

3. **Option C**:  
   - Step i: tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 introduces the tert-butyl group.  
   - Step ii: SO3/H2SO4 introduces a sulfonate group.  
   - Step iii: HNO3/H2SO4 introduces the nitro group.  
   - Step iv: Fe/HCl reduces the nitro group to an amine.  
   - Step v: NaNO2/HCl forms a diazonium salt.  
   - Step vi: HNO3/H2SO4 reintroduces the nitro group, which is unnecessary.  
   - Subsequent steps (vii–ix) involve additional transformations, but the sequence does not align with the target structure.

4. **Option D**:  
   - Step i: HNO3/H2SO4 introduces the nitro group.  
   - Step ii: Fe/HCl reduces the nitro group to an amine.  
   - Step iii: tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 introduces the tert-butyl group via Friedel-Crafts alkylation. However, the benzene ring is already deactivated by the nitro group, making Friedel-Crafts unlikely to proceed.  
   - Subsequent steps (iv–ix) involve additional transformations, but the sequence is inconsistent with the target structure.

After analyzing all options, **Option A** provides the most plausible sequence for synthesizing the target molecule, as it logically introduces the substituents in a manner consistent with the target structure. The ethoxy group is introduced via nucleophilic substitution (NaOH/EtBr), which requires a leaving group, and the other steps align with the required transformations.

Answer: A
