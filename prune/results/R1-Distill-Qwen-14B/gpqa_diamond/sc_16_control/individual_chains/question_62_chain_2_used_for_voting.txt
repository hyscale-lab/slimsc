Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct sequence of reagents to synthesize a specific compound from ethynylcyclohexane. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

The target molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Hmm... Let me draw that structure mentally. So, the main chain is a cyclohexane ring, and attached to it at position 1 is a group. That group is cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl. Wait, so the substituent is a CH2 group that's connected to both a hydroxyl group (OH) and a cyclohexyl group. Also, there's a carbaldehyde group (CHO) on the cyclohexane ring.

So, starting from ethynylcyclohexane. Ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane with an ethynyl group (triple bond) attached. Structure-wise, it's cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH? Or wait, ethynyl is CH2-C≡CH? No, wait, ethynyl is C≡C-CH2-? Wait, maybe it's cyclohexane with a triple bond attached. So, perhaps it's cyclohexane with a substituent of -C≡CH. Oh wait, no, ethynyl would be -C≡C-CH2 maybe? Hmm, maybe I should clarify.

Wait, ethynyl group is actually -C≡CH. So ethynylcyclohexane would have a cyclohexane ring attached to a -C≡CH group. So the structure is cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH? No, wait, wait. Let me get this right. The ethynyl group is the substituent. So ethynylcyclohexane is (cyclohexyl)ethane with a triple bond. Wait, no, ethynyl is the substituent on the cyclohexane. So it's cyclohexane attached to a carbon that's part of a triple bond. So the structure is cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH? Or is it cyclohexane-C≡C-CH2 something? Wait, not sure, but maybe it's (cyclohexyl)ethynyl something else.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the possible reactions. The target compound has a cyclohexane ring with a substituent that's a methyl group attached to both a hydroxyl group and a cyclohexyl group, and also has a carbaldehyde group. So maybe the synthesis involves adding substituents to the cyclohexane ring.

Another approach: let's consider the steps needed to get from ethynylcyclohexane to the target. The target has a cyclohexanecarbaldehyde group, which is a cyclohexane ring with a -CHO group attached. So perhaps the first step is to introduce a carbonyl group.

Wait, ethynylcyclohexane could undergo some kind of addition reaction. Maybe a hydration of the triple bond? Because triple bonds can be hydrolyzed or hydrated under certain conditions.

Wait, another thought: the target molecule has a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH(OH)CH2- group. Hmm, perhaps that's a result of some kind of reduction followed by oxidation or something.

Let me think about each option's steps. The options are all sequences of four reagents each. Let's look at each option:

Option A: 1. NaNH2, methyl chloride. Then H2/Pd, then Ba(OH)2, then H2SO4, etc. Hmm. NaNH2 and methyl chloride is a deprotonation followed by alkylation? Like a methyl Grignard? Or more likely, it's a methyl substitution. Wait, NaNH2 is a strong base, maybe it's a Birch reduction? Or perhaps it's for deprotonating something.

Wait, NaNH2 in methyl chloride could be for alkylation. If the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane, which is CH2-C≡CH attached to cyclohexane. Using NaNH2 is a strong base which can deprotonate things. But methyl chloride might be an alkylating agent. So perhaps it's an alkylation at the sp-hybridized carbon. Wait, but ethynylcyclohexane has a sp-hybridized carbon attached to the cyclohexane.

So, if we take ethynylcyclohexane and treat it with NaNH2 and methyl chloride, maybe it's an alkylation at the triple bond. So the triple bond could undergo some kind of alkylation. Wait, NaNH2 is a strong base; perhaps it abstracts a proton adjacent to the triple bond. For example, in a propargyl system, deprotonation would happen, making an alkyne anion, which then can attack an alkyl halide.

So, if we have CH2-C≡CH (attached to cyclohexane), and we deprotonate to get CH- (negative charge) attached to C≡C-CH2. Then methyl chloride would provide a methyl group. So perhaps the alkyne would add a methyl group. Wait, but ethynylcyclohexane is CH2-C≡CH. Deprotonating would give CH- -C≡CH. Then, adding CH3 from methyl chloride would form (CH2CH2C≡CH) after protonation? Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, maybe the alkyne becomes a propargyl anion, which can undergo alkylation.

Wait, perhaps the initial step is to add a methyl group to the triple bond. So, starting from CH2-C≡CH, after alkylation, it becomes CH2-C≡C-CH2CH3? Or maybe CH2-C-CH2-CH3 after some reaction. Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a propargyl group.

Alternatively, another approach: perhaps the first step is a deprotonation to form a cyclohexenide, which then can undergo alkylation. But I'm not certain.

Moving on, the second step in option A is H2/Pd. That's hydrogenation, probably reducing a triple bond to a single bond. So if after the first step, the triple bond is still present, hydrogenation would turn it into a single bond. For example, CH2-C≡CH becomes CH2-CH2-CH2 after hydrogenation? So that would make a cyclohexylpropane group or something.

Then, the third step is Ba(OH)2. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, used in elimination reactions or for epoxide openings. Or perhaps for forming epoxides? Or maybe it's a dihydroxylation step.

Wait, the fourth step in option A is H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O. That sounds like a hydration or oxidation condition. H2SO4 and HgSO4 could be for the oxymercuration reaction, which adds an -OH and a -HgSO4 group to a triple bond. But wait, after hydrogenation, the triple bond would become a single bond. Hmm, maybe that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps after the alkylation and hydrogenation, the next step is some kind of oxidation. Not sure.

Option B: Steps are NaNH2, ethyl chloride; then Li/liquid NH3; then O3/H2O; then NH4OH.

Wait, NaNH2 and ethyl chloride would be similar to option A but with ethyl. Then Li in liquid NH3 is a strong base, perhaps for deprotonation or elimination. Ozone would be for ozonolysis, which cleaves double bonds.

So maybe the steps are: alkylating the triple bond, then some kind of elimination, then ozonolysis, then workup. But I'm not sure.

Option C: Steps are NaNH2, methyl chloride; then H2/Pd-calcium carbonate; then O3/(CH3)2S; then Ba(OH)2. Hmm. So after the first step, alkylation, then hydrogenation, then ozonolysis, then Ba(OH)2.

Wait, the last step with Ba(OH)2 is puzzling. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, maybe for elimination or epoxide ring opening. But after ozonolysis, which would cleave double bonds, perhaps adding groups.

Option D: Steps are NaNH2 and methanol; then Li/liquid NH3; then O3/(CH3)2S; then NH4OH.

Hmm. NaNH2 and methanol... Maybe it's a Grignard-like reaction, but methanol is a poor electrophile. Or perhaps it's a deprotonation followed by alkylation with methanol as the electrophile. Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the first step is introducing an oxygen group.

Wait, perhaps the overall strategy is to add functional groups step by step.

The target molecule has a cyclohexane ring with a -CHO group (carbaldehyde) and another substituent which is a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group. So perhaps the synthesis involves introducing these two groups.

Let me think about how to get a carbaldehyde group. One way is to oxidize a primary alcohol. So perhaps the synthesis involves introducing an alcohol group which is then oxidized.

Wait, but the target has a hydroxyl group and a carbaldehyde. Maybe the alcohol is formed via some kind of epoxide opening or via ozonolysis and then workup.

Wait, perhaps the process is:

1. Introduce a methyl group adjacent to the triple bond.

2. Hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond, introducing a CH2 group.

3. Then perform some kind of epoxidation or ozonolysis to form carbonyl groups.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, think about the target's structure again. The substituent on the cyclohexane is a CH2 group connected to both a hydroxyl group and a cyclohexyl group. So the substituent is a (cyclohexyl)(hydroxymethyl) group. Wait, that would be -CH(OH)(cyclohexyl). So perhaps the substituent is a geminal diol after some dihydroxylation.

Wait, but in the target, the substituent is a hydroxy and cyclohexyl on the same carbon, which is attached to the main cyclohexane. So perhaps that carbon was part of a cyclopropane or underwent some ring-opening.

Alternatively, maybe the starting material (ethynylcyclohexane) undergoes alkylation to add a methyl group, then hydrogenation to a single bond, then some dihydroxylation or addition of an epoxide, which is then opened to form the hydroxyl and cyclohexyl group.

Wait, another approach: the target molecule has a cyclohexane ring with a substituent that's a hydroxymethyl group attached to another cyclohexyl group. So perhaps that substituent is formed by a ring-opening of an epoxide.

Wait, to get that substituent, maybe there's an epoxide ring that is then opened with a nucleophile, like cyclohexanol, to form the diol. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent comes from a Grignard reaction.

But perhaps it's better to think in terms of each reaction step.

Let me outline what each step in the options might do.

Option A:

Step 1: NaNH2 and methyl chloride. As I thought earlier, this is likely an alkylation. So ethynylcyclohexane (CH2-C≡CH) would react with NaNH2 (which deprotonates to form an anion) and then methyl chloride (CH3Cl) would donate a methyl group. So perhaps the triple bond becomes CH2-C≡C-CH2CH3? Or maybe the alkyne adds a methyl group to the sp-hybrid carbon.

Wait, but NaNH2 is a strong base, and in such conditions, perhaps the alkyne is deprotonated. The ethynyl group is CH2-C≡CH. If we deprotonate the terminal alkyne, we get CH2-C≡C^- which would attack methyl chloride, giving CH2-C≡C-CH2Cl? Or wait, the alkyne is CH2-C≡CH. Deprotonating gives CH^- -C≡CH. Then methyl chloride would provide CH3, so the product would be CH2-C≡C-CH3? Wait, that's 1-propyne becoming 2-propyne? I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the methyl adds to the triple bond, making a longer chain.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a propargyl chloride. Hmm, not sure.

Then step 2: H2/Pd. That would hydrogenate any triple bonds. So if the alkyne is now a longer chain, hydrogenation would make a single bond. So CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? Wait, but that's butane, which doesn't make sense in this context.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkylation adds a methyl group to the triple bond, making the substituent longer.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should think about each option's overall approach.

The target molecule has a cyclohexane ring with a substituent that is a hydroxymethyl group attached to another cyclohexane ring. So the substituent is a bridge between two cyclohexane rings via a hydroxymethyl group.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is formed via a ring-opening of an epoxide. For example, if we have an epoxide group attached to the cyclohexane, and then treat it with a nucleophile like cyclohexanol, it would open the epoxide to form a diol.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is formed by a Grignard reaction. For example, adding a Grignard reagent to a carbonyl group.

So, perhaps the synthesis steps are:

1. Introduce an epoxide group adjacent to the cyclohexane ring.

2. Open the epoxide with a nucleophile (like cyclohexanol) to form the diol.

3. Oxidize an alcohol to a carbonyl group.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the steps involve the formation of a carbonyl group via oxidation.

Wait, another approach: The target molecule has a cyclohexanecarbaldehyde group, which is a cyclohexane ring with a -CHO group. So perhaps the initial step is to introduce a carbonyl group, which comes from oxidizing a primary alcohol.

So, perhaps the steps involve:

- Adding a hydroxyl group to the cyclohexane.

- Then oxidizing that hydroxyl group to a carbonyl.

But the target has another substituent, so maybe the steps are more complex.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethynyl group is first converted into a carbonyl group via hydration, followed by other reactions.

Wait, the triple bond in ethynylcyclohexane can be hydrolyzed to a ketone. Wait, but under what conditions? The oxymercuration would add an -OH and HgSO4 group, but that's for alkenes. Alternatively, acid-catalyzed hydration of an alkyne gives a ketone if the alkyne is terminal. Wait, no. Oh, wait, for a terminal alkyne, acid-catalyzed hydration gives a ketone. For example, HC≡C-R would become R-CO under acid and HgSO4, H2SO4, H2O.

So, if we have ethynylcyclohexane (CH2-C≡CH), and treat it with H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O, it would become a ketone, specifically cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Wait, no, wait. Let me think: ethynylcyclohexane is CH2-C≡CH. Hydration of the triple bond would add an OH and H across the triple bond, giving CH2-C(OH)-CH3. But that's a secondary alcohol. Wait, no, the hydration of a terminal alkyne gives a ketone? Wait, no—terminal alkynes (like HC≡C-R) upon acid-catalyzed hydration give R-CO-H. So for ethynylcyclohexane, it would become cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Oh, wait, because CH2-C≡CH becomes CH2-C(OH)-H, which upon dehydration would form a ketone? Or is it that the hydration directly forms a ketone.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me clarify: The hydration of a terminal alkyne (like HC≡C-CH2-CH3) in the presence of H2SO4, HgSO4, and H2O (oxymercuration) would produce a ketone. So for ethynylcyclohexane (CH2-C≡CH), the triple bond is at the end. So when it's hydrated, it would form cyclohexanecarbaldehyde (CHO group), because the triple bond is CH2-C≡CH. So the hydration would add an O to the triple bond, giving CH2-C(OH)-CH3, but wait, that's a secondary alcohol. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond (ethynyl) is converted into a carbonyl group.

Wait, perhaps I should look up how terminal alkynes are hydrated. Terminal alkynes (like HC≡CR) upon acid-catalyzed hydration (with HgSO4, H2SO4) form ketones. So HC≡CR becomes R-CO-R', but wait, in this case, the alkyne is CH2-C≡CH. So the hydration would form CH2-C(O)-H, which is a ketone? Wait, CH2-C(O)-H is actually an aldehyde. So that would make the cyclohexane ring attached to a CH2 group, which is attached to a carbonyl (CHO). So that would give cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Wait, but the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane, which is CH2-C≡CH attached to the cyclohexane. So after hydration, it would become CH2-C(O)-H, which is a CHO group. So that gives cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, which is part of the target molecule.

So step 3 or 4 in some options involves H2SO4 and HgSO4, which would be the condition for oxymercuration to form the aldehyde. So perhaps one of the steps in the correct sequence is this hydration.

But the target molecule also has another substituent, the cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group. So perhaps the synthesis involves adding that group as well.

Wait, so perhaps the steps are:

1. Alkylate the triple bond to add a substituent.

2. Hydrogenate to make a single bond.

3. Perform an epoxidation or some dihydroxylation.

4. Open the epoxide with a nucleophile.

Alternatively, perhaps after adding a substituent via alkylation, the triple bond is hydrogenated, and then some dihydroxylation occurs to add the hydroxyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial step is to introduce a methyl group (via alkylation), then reduce the triple bond to a single bond, then perform an epoxidation, and then open the epoxide.

Wait, perhaps looking at the options, the correct sequence includes an alkylation step, hydrogenation, ozonolysis, and then some workup.

Wait, in option C, step 3 is O3/(CH3)2S. Ozone is for cleaving double bonds, and (CH3)2S is a reductive workup, which would give aldehydes or ketones, depending on the starting alkene.

Hmm. So if after step 2 (H2/Pd), the triple bond is hydrogenated to a single bond, but that would give a single bond. Then, if an alkene is formed, ozonolysis could cleave it.

Wait, perhaps after step 1 and 2, we have a diene or an alkene, which is then cleaved by ozonolysis to form carbonyl groups.

Alternatively, maybe the steps are:

1. Alkylate the alkyne to add a methyl group.

2. Hydrogenate the alkyne to a single bond, creating a longer chain.

3. Ozonolyze an alkene to form carbonyl groups.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about each option.

Option C's steps:

1. NaNH2 and methyl chloride → probably alkylation of the alkyne.

2. H2/Pd → hydrogenate the triple bond to single bond, making a CH2CH2CH3 group? Not sure.

3. O3/(CH3)2S → cleave any double bonds. But if after step 2, the triple bond is gone, perhaps the structure now has a double bond that was formed during hydrogenation? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps step 2 is hydrogenation of the alkyne to an alkene, not a single bond. Wait, H2 with a catalyst like Pd would hydrogenate triple bonds to single bonds, right? Because alkyne hydrogenation typically goes all the way to single bonds. Unless it's Lindlar's catalyst, which stops at cis alkenes.

Wait, step 2 in option C is H2/Pd-calcium carbonate. Pd-CaCO3 is a catalyst for hydrogenation. So the alkyne would be hydrogenated to an alkane (single bond).

After that, ozonolysis wouldn't have anything to act on, since the triple bond is gone. So that doesn't make sense.

Hmm. Maybe I should think about the options again.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Alkylate the alkyne to add a methyl group.

2. Reduce the alkyne to an alkene.

Wait, but that's not one of the options. Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is hydrogenated to a cis-alkene.

Wait, perhaps step 2 in some options is Li/NH3, which is a strong base used in elimination reactions. For example, converting an alcohol to an alkene via E2.

Wait, option B's step 2 is Li/liq. NH3. That's a strong base, perhaps for elimination. So if step 1 is alkylation, step 2 is elimination to form a double bond.

Then, step 3 is ozonolysis, which would cleave the double bond.

Hmm. For example, if after step 1 we have a molecule with a CH2-CH2-CH3 group, step 2 could eliminate to form a double bond, creating a CH2=CH-CH2- group. Then, ozonolysis would break the double bond into two carbonyl groups.

Wait, but I'm not sure how that connects to the target molecule.

Alternatively, perhaps the sequence is:

1. Alkyne alkylation to add a substituent.

2. Hydrogenation to alkene.

3. Ozonolysis to form carbonyl groups.

4. Workup to form the diol.

Alternatively, perhaps the target has two carbonyl groups, but I'm not sure.

Another angle: the target has a hydroxyl group attached to a carbon that's also attached to a cyclohexyl group and the main cyclohexane ring. So perhaps that comes from a diol that's formed via epoxide opening.

Wait, perhaps after alkylation and hydrogenation, an epoxide is formed, which is then opened with a cyclohexyl group.

But I'm not seeing the connection.

Alternatively, perhaps the target's substituent is formed via a Grignard reaction. For example, adding a Grignard reagent to a carbonyl group to form a new carbon-carbon bond.

So perhaps the steps are:

1. Introduce a carbonyl group (from the alkyne).

2. Perform a Grignard reaction to add a cyclohexyl group.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: the target molecule has a structure where the main cyclohexane ring has a substituent that's a CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group. So perhaps that substituent comes from a Grignard addition to a carbonyl group.

Wait, but the Grignard would add to a ketone or aldehyde. So maybe the steps are:

1. Convert the alkyne to a carbonyl group.

2. Add a Grignard reagent (like cyclohexyl magnesium bromide) to the carbonyl.

3. Work up to form the alcohol.

But then, how does that fit into the options given?

Alternatively, perhaps the steps involve forming an epoxide, which upon ring-opening forms the diol substituent.

Wait, but I'm not seeing the right path.

Let me try to think of each option's steps.

Option D:

1. NaNH2, methanol.

Hmm. NaNH2 is a strong base. Methanol is a weak electrophile. Perhaps this is a deprotonation followed by alkylation, but with methanol as the electrophile. Not sure what that would do.

2. Li/liq. NH3. That's a strong base, maybe for elimination.

3. O3/(CH3)2S. Ozonolysis, which cleaves double bonds.

4. NH4OH. Neutralization or workup.

So maybe the steps are: alkylate, eliminate to form a double bond, ozonolyze to cleave, then workup.

But I'm not sure what that would produce.

Hmm.

Wait, let me think about each step in option C again.

Option C:

1. NaNH2 and methyl chloride: alkylation, adding a methyl group to the alkyne.

2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate: hydrogenate the triple bond to single bond.

3. O3/(CH3)2S: ozonolysis. But if the triple bond is hydrogenated to single bond, where would the double bond come from?

Unless, perhaps, after alkylation, the structure has a double bond. For example, if the alkylation leads to a propargyl group, which upon hydrogenation becomes a single bond.

Wait, perhaps the initial structure is CH2-C≡CH. After alkylation with methyl chloride, perhaps it becomes CH2-C≡C-CH2CH3. Then hydrogenation would reduce the triple bond to single, giving CH2-CH2-CH2CH3. So that's a straight chain, but I'm not seeing how that connects to the target.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkylation leads to a different structure.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.

The target molecule has two cyclohexane rings connected via a CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group and a CHO group on the main ring.

Alternative approach: The target has a structure where the substituent is a hydroxyl and a cyclohexyl attached to the same carbon, which is also attached to the main ring. So perhaps that substituent is formed by a Grignard reaction.

Wait, perhaps the steps are:

1. Alkylation of the alkyne to add a methyl group.

2. Hydrogenation of the alkyne to an alkane.

3. Ozonolysis of a double bond to form carbonyl groups.

4. Workup with a base to form the diol.

But I'm not sure.

Another thought: The target's substituent has a hydroxyl group and a cyclohexyl group on the same carbon. Maybe this is formed via a nucleophilic addition to a carbonyl group.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is formed by adding a Grignard reagent to a carbonyl group. For example:

- Step 1: Convert the alkyne into a carbonyl group (using H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O).

- Step 2: Perform a Grignard reaction with cyclohexyl magnesium bromide.

- Step 3: Work up to form the alcohol.

But looking at the options, I don't see any that have H2SO4 and HgSO4 as the first step.

Wait, option A's last step is H2SO4 and HgSO4. So perhaps the first steps set up something else.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Alkylation of the alkyne.

2. Reduction to a single bond.

3. Ozonolysis to form carbonyl groups.

4. Workup to form diols, which are then oxidized or something.

But I'm not seeing the connection.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence involves epoxidation of a double bond, followed by ring-opening to form the diol.

Hmm. I'm getting a bit stuck, but perhaps I should try to think about the options again.

Looking for steps that include:

- Alkylation of the alkyne.

- Reduction of triple bond.

- Formation of a double bond.

- Ozonolysis.

Wait, let me think about option D.

Option D:

1. NaNH2, methanol.

2. Li/NH3.

3. O3/(CH3)2S.

4. NH4OH.

So step 1: NaNH2 and methanol. Maybe it's deprotonation and alkylation with methanol, but I'm not sure about the mechanism.

Step 2: Li/NH3 is a strong base, often used in deprotonation or elimination reactions, like the Birch reduction or for forming alkenes from alcohols.

Step 3: Ozonolysis, cleaving double bonds into carbonyl groups.

Step 4: Workup with ammonium hydroxide.

So perhaps the steps are:

1. Alkylate the alkyne.

2. Eliminate to form a double bond.

3. Ozonolyze to form carbonyl groups.

But I'm not sure how that leads to the target.

Wait, another angle: The target has a carbaldehyde group, which could come from the alkyne via hydration. So perhaps one of the steps is the hydration of the alkyne to form the aldehyde.

Looking at the options, the steps that include H2SO4 and HgSO4 are options A and C. So perhaps the correct sequence involves these steps.

Wait, but in option A, the last step is H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O. So step 4 of option A is that. So perhaps step 4 is the hydration of the alkyne to form the aldehyde.

But the target has another substituent as well. So perhaps the steps are:

1. Alkylation of the alkyne to add a methyl group.

2. Hydrogenation to single bond.

3. Perform some reaction to form the substituent.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Alkylate the alkyne.

2. Hydrogenate to single bond.

3. Ozonolyze to form carbonyl groups.

4. Workup.

But I'm not sure.

Another approach: Let's consider what each option's steps would produce.

Option C:

1. Alkylation → adds methyl group to alkyne.

2. H2/Pd → hydrogenate triple bond to single.

3. Ozonolysis → need a double bond, but after hydrogenation, the triple is gone. So I'm not sure where the double bond comes from.

Unless, maybe during the hydrogenation, the triple becomes a double bond. Wait, but Pd usually hydrogenates triple bonds to single bonds. Unless it's Lindlar's catalyst, which stops at cis double bonds.

But in option C, step 2 is H2/Pd-calcium carbonate. Pd-CaCO3 is a typical catalyst for full hydrogenation, so the triple would become single.

So after step 2, no double bond exists, which would make the ozonolysis step (step 3) ineffective. So that can't be right. So option C's step 3 wouldn't do anything, which suggests option C is incorrect.

Therefore, the correct option must have a step that forms a double bond after the alkylation.

Looking at option B:

Step 2: Li/liq. NH3 → strong base, perhaps elimination to form a double bond.

So after alkylation (step 1), step 2 could eliminate to form a double bond.

Then, step 3 is ozonolysis, which would cleave the double bond into carbonyl groups.

Then, step 4 is NH4OH, which is a workup, perhaps hydrolysis.

So perhaps the steps are:

1. Alkylate the alkyne to add a substituent.

2. Eliminate to form a double bond.

3. Ozonolyze to form carbonyl groups.

4. Workup.

But would that lead to the target?

Alternatively, perhaps after alkylation and elimination, the structure has a double bond, which upon ozonolysis forms two carbonyl groups. Then, perhaps one of them is further modified.

Alternatively, perhaps the target's substituent is formed via this pathway.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck, but perhaps the correct answer is option C.

Wait, but earlier analysis suggests that option C's step 3 would be ineffective.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look for the reagents that would form the hydroxymethyl group.

Wait, the target has a hydroxymethyl group attached to a cyclohexyl group. So perhaps that comes from an epoxide ring-opening.

So, after forming an epoxide, treatment with a nucleophile (like cyclohexanol) would open the epoxide to form a diol.

But how would that epoxide be formed?

If the alkyne is hydrogenated to a diol, perhaps through some dihydroxylation.

Wait, but I'm not finding a clear path.

Another approach: perhaps the correct steps are:

1. Alkylate the alkyne to add a methyl group.

2. Hydrogenate the alkyne to a single bond.

3. Ozonolysis isn't applicable here.

Wait, perhaps option D's steps:

1. NaNH2 and methanol. Maybe deprotonation and alkylation with methanol, forming an ether.

But I'm not seeing the connection.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is option C.

But I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C.

Wait, let me think again.

The target molecule has a cyclohexanecarbaldehyde group, which comes from the hydration of the alkyne. So one of the steps must involve that.

Looking at the options, option C's last step is Ba(OH)2. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, perhaps for elimination or epoxide ring opening.

Option A's last step is H2SO4 and HgSO4, which would be for hydration of the alkyne.

So perhaps option A's steps are:

1. Alkylate the alkyne.

2. Hydrogenate to single bond.

3. Ba(OH)2 → not sure.

4. H2SO4, HgSO4 → hydration to aldehyde.

But the target has another substituent, so perhaps the steps are:

Alkylate to add a substituent, reduce to single bond, then form the substituent via some other reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is formed via Ba(OH)2 in step 3. Ba(OH)2 is used for forming epoxides from alkenes, but if the structure after step 2 is a single bond, then Ba(OH)2 wouldn't form an epoxide.

Alternatively, Ba(OH)2 could be used for elimination, forming a double bond. But I'm not sure.

I'm getting a bit stuck, but perhaps the correct answer is option C.

Wait, let me think about the steps in option C.

1. Alkylation: adds a methyl group to the alkyne.

2. Hydrogenation: reduces the triple bond to single bond.

Now, the structure has a longer alkyl chain attached to the cyclohexane.

3. Ozone with (CH3)2S: cleaves double bonds, but if there's no double bond, this step does nothing. So perhaps this is not the right option.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D.

Step 1: NaNH2 and methanol. Maybe this is for deprotonating and adding a methoxy group.

But I'm not sure.

Hmm.

Another approach: the target molecule has a cyclohexanecarbaldehyde group, which suggests that the alkyne was converted into a carbonyl. So the step that does this is the last step in option A (H2SO4, HgSO4) and the last step in option C (Ba(OH)2). Wait, no. Ba(OH)2 is a base, not for hydration.

Wait, the hydration (H2SO4, HgSO4) is step 4 in option A. So if that's the case, perhaps the steps in option A are:

1. Alkylation.

2. Hydrogenation.

3. Ba(OH)2 → perhaps elimination to form a double bond.

4. Hydration to form aldehyde.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, suppose ethynylcyclohexane undergoes alkylation to become CH2-C≡C-Me.

Then, hydrogenation makes it CH2-CH2-CH2-Me.

Then, Ba(OH)2 could cause some elimination to form a double bond.

Then, H2SO4 and HgSO4 would hydrate the double bond to form a carbonyl group.

But the target has a substituent with a hydroxyl and cyclohexyl group. So perhaps during step 3, Ba(OH)2 is used to form an epoxide, which is then opened to form the diol.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Alkylation.

2. Hydrogenation.

3. Ozonolysis to form carbonyl groups.

4. Workup.

But without a double bond, ozonolysis is ineffective.

Hmm.

I'm starting to think that perhaps the correct answer is option C. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D.

Wait, in option D, steps 3 and 4 are ozonolysis and NH4OH. Ozonolysis would cleave any double bonds, but if there's no double bond, nothing happens.

I think I'm stuck, but perhaps I should make an educated guess.

Wait, another approach: the target molecule has a substituent that is a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group. This suggests that a cyclohexyl group was added via a nucleophilic substitution or Grignard reaction.

So perhaps the steps are:

1. Alkylate the alkyne to add a methyl group.

2. Hydrogenate to single bond.

3. Perform a Grignard reaction to add a cyclohexyl group.

But I don't see any Grignard reagents in the steps.

Alternatively, perhaps after forming a carbonyl group, a Grignard reagent adds.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C, but I'm not confident.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C.

Wait, let me think about the steps again.

Option C:

1. Alkylation → adds methyl.

2. H2/Pd → hydrogenate triple to single.

3. Ozonolysis → no double bond, so nothing.

4. Ba(OH)2 → maybe elimination.

But without a double bond, this wouldn't work.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D.

Wait, in option D, step 1: NaNH2 and methanol. Maybe this is a Birch reduction, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps step 1 is deprotonation and alkylation with methanol, forming an ether.

But I'm not certain.

I'm going to make a guess here. Based on the analysis, the correct reagents probably involve alkylation, hydrogenation, and then some cleavage reaction.

I think the correct answer is option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves determining the correct sequence of reagents to synthesize 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde from ethynylcyclohexane. The target molecule has a cyclohexane ring with a carbaldehyde group (-CHO) and a substituent that is a hydroxymethyl group attached to a cyclohexyl group. The analysis of the options is as follows:

### Key Analysis of Options:
1. **Option A**:
   - Step 1: NaNH₂ and methyl chloride likely alkylate the alkyne.
   - Step 2: H₂/Pd reduces the alkyne to a single bond.
   - Step 3: Ba(OH)₂ is a strong base, possibly for elimination or epoxide formation.
   - Step 4: H₂SO₄ and HgSO₄ hydrate the alkyne to form the aldehyde.
   - However, the sequence does not clearly explain how the hydroxymethyl-cyclohexyl substituent is formed.

2. **Option B**:
   - Step 1: NaNH₂ and ethyl chloride alkylate the alkyne.
   - Step 2: Li/liq. NH₃ is a strong base, possibly for elimination to form a double bond.
   - Step 3: O₃/H₂O cleaves the double bond via ozonolysis.
   - Step 4: NH₄OH is a workup step.
   - This sequence does not clearly lead to the formation of the hydroxymethyl-cyclohexyl substituent.

3. **Option C**:
   - Step 1: NaNH₂ and methyl chloride alkylate the alkyne.
   - Step 2: H₂/Pd reduces the alkyne to a single bond.
   - Step 3: O₃/(CH₃)₂S cleaves double bonds, but after hydrogenation, no double bond is present, making this step ineffective.
   - Step 4: Ba(OH)₂ is a strong base, possibly for elimination or epoxide formation.
   - This sequence does not clearly explain the formation of the hydroxymethyl-cyclohexyl substituent.

4. **Option D**:
   - Step 1: NaNH₂ and methanol likely alkylate the alkyne.
   - Step 2: Li/liq. NH₃ is a strong base, possibly for elimination to form a double bond.
   - Step 3: O₃/(CH₃)₂S cleaves the double bond via ozonolysis.
   - Step 4: NH₄OH is a workup step.
   - Similar to Option B, this sequence does not clearly lead to the formation of the hydroxymethyl-cyclohexyl substituent.

### Conclusion:
The target molecule requires the formation of a carbaldehyde group and a hydroxymethyl-cyclohexyl substituent. While none of the options fully clarify how the hydroxymethyl-cyclohexyl group is formed, **Option C** is selected as the most plausible based on the sequence of alkylation, hydrogenation, and potential elimination or epoxide formation steps, despite some ambiguities.
