Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Hmm, let's read it again.

The question says that a chemist performed two reactions using two different reducing agents. The products are both (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. Wait, no, actually, no, wait. Let me recheck. The first reaction uses A with LiBH4 and H+ to give (R)-4-ethyl... and the second uses B with BH3 and H+ to give (S)-4-ethyl... So each starting material A and B leads to a specific enantiomer after reduction.

The options are four possibilities where A and B are specific forms of 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, either R or S configuration.

Wait, so the products are both tetrahydro-pyran-2-ones with an ethyl group at position 4, but one is R and the other S. The starting materials are these pentanoic acids with substituents.

I remember that when you reduce a ketone with a specific reducing agent, the stereochemistry of the product depends on the starting material and the reducing agent. Oh right, LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, while BH3 is maybe a different scenario, but wait, both are borohydrides. Wait no, LiBH4 is a common reducing agent for ketones, but BH3 is typically used in the formation of alkenes via hydroboration, but wait, perhaps it's about the reduction of esters or something else. Wait, maybe it's about the reduction of a carbonyl group in the presence of certain protecting groups.

Wait, looking at the starting material: 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. That's a pentanoic acid with an oxo group (C=O) at position 5, and an isobutoxy group at the same position. So the structure would be:

O
||
O-C-O-CH2CH(CH3)2 (isobutoxy)
|
CH2CH2CH(CH2CH2CH3) ?

Wait, perhaps a better way to visualize: the molecule is something like CH2-CH2-C(=O)-O-CH(CH2CH3)2 or wait, maybe I should draw it more accurately.

Wait, the formula is 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. So pentanoic acid means five carbons, with the COOH at the end. So the structure is:

COOH - CH2 - CH(CH2CH2CH3) - C(O)-O-CH2CH(CH3)2 ? Or wait, no. Let me count the carbons. Numbering from the COOH group.

1: COOH
2: CH2
3: CH(CH2CH2CH3)
Wait, no, the ethyl group is on carbon 3. So carbon 3 is CH2CH2CH3? Wait, wait. Wait, 3-ethyl would be on carbon 3. So the structure is:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-C(O)-O-... wait, but the 5 position. Wait, pentanoic acid is five carbons: 1 (COOH), 2 (CH2), 3 (CH), 4 (CH2?), no, perhaps it's:

Wait, maybe the structure is:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-CO-O-CH2CH(CH3)2 ?

Wait, no, because the compound is 5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. So the pentanoic acid is the main chain, and at carbon 5 (which is the same as the carbonyl carbon?), wait, perhaps I should think of the structure as:

Carbons 1 to 5: 1 is COOH, 2 and 3 are CH2 and CH, respectively. Wait, maybe it's:

1: COOH
2: CH2
3: CH(CH2CH2CH3) [ethyl group]
4: C=O (since it's 5-oxo)
Wait, but wait, the numbering might be different. Maybe the COOH is position 1, then positions 2,3,4,5.

Wait, pentanoic acid is CH2CH2CH2CH2COOH? No, wait, pentanoic acid is CH3CH2CH2CH2COOH. So in this case, the substituents are on different positions.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-C(O-O-CH(CH2CH3)2) ?

Wait, maybe it's better to think of the structure as:

The molecule is 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. So the main chain is five carbons, with:

1: COOH
2: CH2
3: CH(CH2CH2CH3) [ethyl group at C3]
4: O
5: O-CH2CH(CH3)2 [isobutoxy group at C5], and a ketone also at C5 (5-oxo). Wait, that can't be right because the same carbon can't have both a ketone and an ether group unless it's a geminal di-substitution.

Ah, wait, no. The structure is likely:

The carbon 5 is the same as the carbonyl carbon. So the structure is:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-C(O)-O-CH2CH(CH3)2.

So, the molecule is a pentanoic acid where at carbon 5 (the same as the carbonyl carbon), there's an isobutoxy group attached. So the carbonyl is at C5, and the isobutoxy is also attached to C5.

But wait, that would mean that the structure is:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-C(O-O-CH2CH(CH3)2)- ?

Wait, no. Because 5-oxo would be a ketone, and 5-isobutoxy would be an ether group. So the same carbon can't have both a ketone and an ether. So perhaps, the structure is more like:

The pentanoic acid is:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-O-C(=O)-O-CH2CH(CH3)2 ?

Wait, that doesn't make sense either. Maybe it's better to think of it as:

The molecule is a pentanoic acid with substituents on carbon 3 and 5. Carbon 3 has an ethyl group, and carbon 5 has both a ketone and an isobutoxy group. Oh wait, that's impossible. So perhaps the structure is:

The 5-oxo is a ketone, and the 5-isobutoxy is on the same carbon. So the structure is:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-C(O-O-CH(CH2CH3)2)-something. Hmm, perhaps the structure is:

The molecule is a pentanoic acid, with a ketone at position 5 (so the fifth carbon is the carbonyl group) and an isobutoxy group also attached at position 5. Wait, but that would imply that the fifth carbon is a carbonyl and an ether. That's not possible because a carbon can't have both a ketone and an ether group unless it's a geminal di-substitution, but that's not common.

Wait, perhaps the structure is more like this:

The main chain is COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-CH2-C(O-O-CH(CH2CH3)2). Wait, but that would make the isobutoxy group on carbon 5, which is the same as the ketone.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is a cyclic hemiacetal or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is an ester, not a carboxylic acid. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic hemiacetal or some other structure. Wait, the product is a tetrahydro-pyran-2-one. That's a six-membered ring with an oxygen and a ketone. So when the starting material is reduced, perhaps it undergoes a ring-forming process.

Wait, maybe the starting material is a gamma-keto ester or something similar that can undergo a reduction to form a cyclic hemiacetal.

Alternatively, maybe the starting material is a diketone, but that doesn't seem to fit the description.

Hmm, perhaps the reaction is a reduction of a ketone group that is part of a carbonyl group attached to an ester or something similar, leading to the formation of an alcohol, which then forms a ring.

Wait, the product is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. So the structure is a six-membered ring, with a ketone at position 2, and an ethyl group at position 4.

So perhaps the starting material is a gamma-keto ester, which upon reduction forms a secondary alcohol, and then undergoes cyclization to form the ring.

Wait, let me think. So when you reduce a ketone, you typically get an alcohol. If the starting material has a ketone, like R-CO-R', reducing it with LiBH4 would give R-CH(OH)-R'.

But in this case, the product is a cyclic ether with a ketone. So perhaps the starting material has a carbonyl group adjacent to an oxygen, which upon reduction forms an alcohol, which then undergoes cyclization to form the ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is an ester, and the reduction leads to the formation of a diol, which then cyclizes.

Wait, but the starting material is a pentanoic acid derivative. So maybe it's a beta-keto acid or something similar.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ketone, but that's probably not the case here.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is an enol ether or something that can form a ring upon reduction.

Alternatively, maybe the starting material is a keto ester, such as ethyl acetoacetate, which upon reduction forms a diol, which can then undergo cyclization to form a ring. But in this case, the product is a tetrahydropyranone, which is a six-membered ring.

Wait, maybe the starting material is a gamma-keto ester. Let me think: gamma-keto ester would have the structure RCO-COOR', where R and R' are substituents. Upon reduction, the ketone (RCO-) would become RCH(OH)-, and then perhaps the ester would hydrolyze under certain conditions to form a diol, which can cyclize to form a ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ester, like a lactone, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think about the reaction conditions. The first reaction uses LiBH4 and H+. LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, typically used to reduce ketones to secondary alcohols, esters to alcohols, etc. The second reaction uses BH3 and H+. Wait, BH3 is usually used in hydroboration reactions, but perhaps in this case, it's used as a reducing agent under specific conditions.

Wait, but BH3 itself is a Lewis acid and is often used in the BH3-Lewis acid catalyzed reactions, like in hydroboration or in the reduction of esters or ketones. Alternatively, maybe it's a typo and it's LiAlH4, but no, the question says BH3.

Wait, no, I think I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the stereochemistry. The product has an R configuration in one case and S in the other. So the starting material's configuration must influence the product's configuration.

If the starting material is a ketone, and the reduction forms an alcohol, the configuration of the starting material will determine the configuration of the product. Wait, but in ketone reductions, LiBH4 typically doesn't change the stereochemistry because the ketone is planar. Wait, no. Wait, when you reduce a ketone, the product is a secondary alcohol, and the configuration at the new stereogenic center depends on the reducing agent and the starting material's configuration.

Wait, but wait, if the starting material is a planar sp2 hybridized carbonyl group, then the reduction would form a stereogenic center, and the configuration would depend on the reducing agent. For instance, BH3 followed by H+ (like in hydroboration) can lead to anti-Markovnikov addition with specific stereochemistry, but in the case of ketone reductions, perhaps the approach of the hydride can determine the configuration.

Wait, but wait, in the reduction of a chiral ketone, the configuration of the starting material would influence the product's configuration. Alternatively, perhaps the starting material isn't chiral, and the reduction creates a new chiral center.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic hemiacetal or something else.

Wait, the products are both 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, but one is R and the other S. So the difference in configuration must come from the configuration of the starting material.

Wait, in the first reaction, A is treated with LiBH4 and H+ to give (R)-4-ethyl..., and B is treated with BH3 and H+ to give (S)-4-ethyl....

So the same starting material but different reagents would give different configurations. Or perhaps the starting materials have different configurations, and the same reagent gives different products based on that.

Wait, LiBH4 and BH3 are different reducing agents. Maybe one leads to retention of configuration and the other to inversion, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: when you reduce a ketone with a specific stereochemistry, perhaps the approach of the hydride can lead to different configurations based on the reagent's strength.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the possible starting materials. The options all have A and B as either R or S 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.

So the starting materials are enantiomers if they are R and S, or the same if both R or both S.

When you reduce a ketone group in such a molecule, you'd get an alcohol. But wait, the product is a cyclic ketone. Hmm, that doesn't quite make sense. Wait, no, the product is a tetrahydropyran-2-one, which is a cyclic ether with a ketone. So perhaps the starting material is an ester or a hemiacetal.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a diketone, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a carbonyl compound with an adjacent leaving group, such that upon reduction, a ring is formed.

Wait, maybe the starting material is a cyclic ester, a lactone, which upon reduction forms a diol, which then cyclizes into a ring with an ether linkage and a ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a gamma-keto ester. For example, something like ethyl acetoacetate. When reduced, the ketone becomes an alcohol, and then under acidic conditions, it could cyclize to form a five or six-membered ring.

Wait, let's think. If the starting material is a gamma-keto ester, like CH3COCO-O-R, then upon reduction with LiBH4, the ketone (the gamma one) would be reduced to an alcohol, giving CH3CH(OH)CO-O-R. Then, under acidic conditions, the ester might hydrolyze to a carboxylic acid, but that's not directly leading to the product here.

Alternatively, perhaps the reduction leads to a diol, which then undergoes cyclization. For example, if the starting material has two carbonyl groups, but that's not the case here.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic hemiacetal, and the reduction leads to ring opening and then ring closure again. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is formed via the Claisen or Dieckmann condensation, but that's more about forming rings through elimination.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a beta-keto acid. For example, after reduction, the beta-keto acid becomes a beta-hydroxy acid, which can then cyclize to form a cyclic ketone.

Wait, but the product is a tetrahydropyran-2-one, which is a six-membered ring. So, perhaps the starting material has five carbons, allowing for a six-membered ring upon cyclization.

Wait, the starting material is 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. So, the structure is:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-C(O-O-CH(CH2CH3)2)

Wait, that doesn't seem right because, again, the same carbon can't have both a ketone and an ether group. So perhaps I'm misinterpreting the structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ketone with an ester group, but I'm not quite getting it.

Another angle: the reaction of the starting material with the reducing agents leads to the formation of a secondary alcohol, which then undergoes cyclization to form a six-membered ring with an ether linkage and a ketone.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is an ester with a ketone group. For example, if the starting material is a gamma-keto ester, such as ethyl acetoacetate, then treatment with a reducing agent would reduce the ketone to an alcohol, creating a diol, which then cyclizes to form a ring.

Wait, but ethyl acetoacetate is a beta-keto ester, not a gamma. So upon reduction, it would form a secondary alcohol, which could then cyclize.

Alternatively, the starting material is a gamma-keto ester, like methyl pentanoate with a ketone group at gamma position. Let's imagine the structure: CH3CH2CH2CO-CO-O-R. Upon reduction, the ketone becomes CH3CH2CH2CH(OH)-CO-O-R. Then, under acidic conditions, the ester might hydrolyze to a carboxylic acid, but that's not directly helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a methyl vinyl ketone, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the stereochemistry. The product is (R) or (S) depending on the starting material and the reagent.

Suppose the starting material is a beta-keto ester, which upon reduction forms a secondary alcohol. The configuration of the starting material would influence the configuration of the product.

Wait, but the starting material is a pentanoic acid derivative with substituents. Let's imagine that the reduction leads to the formation of a secondary alcohol at a certain position, which then undergoes a cyclization to form the ring.

If the starting material is a chiral center at C3 (the ethyl group), then the configuration there would influence the configuration of the product.

Wait, perhaps the reduction doesn't change the configuration of the starting material but introduces a new chiral center. Or perhaps the starting material's configuration determines the approach of the hydride, influencing the product's configuration.

Wait, when you reduce a ketone with a chiral center nearby, the configuration of the new stereocenter can depend on the reducing agent and the structure.

Wait, in the case of LiBH4, which is a strong reducing agent, the approach of the hydride is from the less hindered side. For a planar ketone, the hydride can approach from either face, leading to a racemic mixture if the ketone is prochiral. But if the ketone is adjacent to a chiral center, the configuration of that center can influence the approach of the hydride, leading to a specific configuration in the product.

Wait, so maybe the starting material has a chiral center (the ethyl group at C3), and the hydride approaches from the same face as the ethyl group, leading to the product's configuration.

Alternatively, perhaps the configuration of the starting material (R or S) leads to the configuration of the product (R or S) based on the reducing agent.

Wait, but in the first reaction, using LiBH4 and H+, the product is R. In the second, using BH3 and H+, the product is S. So perhaps the same starting material, when reduced with different agents, gives different configurations. But that seems unlikely unless the approach of the hydride differs.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials A and B are enantiomers, and the reducing agents cause the products to have opposite configurations.

So, if A is R and B is S, then using different reagents would lead to which product?

Wait, perhaps the configuration of the starting material determines the configuration of the product. For example, if the starting material is R, the product is R when using LiBH4, and S when using BH3. Or something like that.

Alternatively, perhaps the reducing agents cause the hydride to approach from different faces, leading to opposite configurations.

Wait, but LiBH4 is a stronger reducing agent than BH3. So perhaps the mechanism differs. LiBH4 acts as a source of H- (hydride), and the hydride attacks the carbonyl carbon. The approach depends on the steric environment.

If the starting material has an R configuration at a certain position, the hydride would approach from the opposite face, leading to the product's configuration.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material's configuration dictates the product's configuration via the hydride attack.

Wait, maybe the starting material is a ketone adjacent to a chiral center. So the ketone is at C5, and the chiral center is at C3 (ethyl group). When reduced, the hydride attacks from the less hindered side, which is influenced by the ethyl group's configuration.

So, if the starting material is R configuration at C3, the hydride would approach from a certain face, leading to R configuration in the product. Or maybe the opposite.

But I'm not entirely sure about this.

Alternatively, I've heard that when a ketone is adjacent to a chiral center, the configuration of that center can influence the hydride attack, leading to a specific stereochemistry in the product. So perhaps the configuration of the starting material's chiral center determines the product's configuration.

So, maybe when the starting material's ethyl group is in the R configuration (like in option D for A), the hydride approaches from the same face, leading to the product's R configuration.

Alternatively, perhaps the opposite happens. Let's say the starting material is (R) at C3, and the hydride approaches from the same side as the ethyl group, leading to a specific configuration in the product.

Wait, but I'm not entirely confident about the exact relationship.

Alternatively, perhaps the configuration of the starting material is the opposite of the product's configuration, depending on the reagent.

Wait, perhaps using LiBH4 leads to retention of configuration, while BH3 leads to inversion. Or vice versa.

Wait, but I'm not certain about the effect of the different reducing agents on the stereochemistry.

Another approach: look at the options. Option D says A is (R) and B is (S). So if A and B are enantiomers, and each is reduced with different reagents, perhaps the product's configuration depends on the starting material.

So, for example, if A is R and B is S, then perhaps the product from A gives R, and the product from B gives S, or the opposite.

But in the question, the product from A is R, and from B is S. So perhaps the same starting material would give opposite products based on the reagent. Alternatively, perhaps when A is R, the product is R, and when B is S, the product is S.

Wait, perhaps each starting material, when reduced with their respective reagent, gives the product with the opposite configuration.

Alternatively, perhaps the reagent determines the face from which the hydride approaches.

Wait, perhaps LiBH4 leads to the hydride attacking from one face, while BH3 leads to attack from the other.

In that case, if the starting material is R, with LiBH4, the product would be R. With BH3, the same starting material would give S. But that's just a guess.

Alternatively, perhaps the product's configuration is the same as the starting material when using LiBH4, and opposite when using BH3.

Wait, but I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, perhaps the configuration of the starting material and the reagent together determine the product's configuration.

So, for option D, A is R and B is S. So when A is treated with LiBH4, perhaps the product is R. When B is treated with BH3, the product is S. So that matches the question.

So, looking at the options:

Option D says A is R and B is S.

So, when A (R) is reduced with LiBH4, product is R.

When B (S) is reduced with BH3, product is S.

That would fit the given products.

Alternatively, perhaps when the starting material is R, the product is R, regardless of the reagent.

But I'm not entirely certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the configuration of the product is the opposite of the starting material when using different reagents.

So, if A is R, product is R or S? If the product is R when using LiBH4, and S when using BH3, but that would require the same starting material to give different products, which is possible if the reagents cause the hydride to approach from different faces.

But that would imply that the same starting material would give different configurations with different reagents, but only if the starting material is chiral and the reagents approach differently.

Wait, but in this problem, the starting materials A and B are different (they're different starting materials), so perhaps A is R and B is S, and each when reduced gives a product of R and S, respectively, or vice versa.

Wait, but the products are (R) from A and (S) from B. So if A is R, the product is R, and B is S, the product is S. So the starting materials must be enantiomers, and each gives the same configuration product.

But that doesn't make sense because if A and B are enantiomers, reducing each should give products that are enantiomers, but the products are given as (R) and (S), which are enantiomers.

Wait, so if A is R and B is S, then when reduced with the same reagent, the products would be enantiomers. But in this case, the reagents are different.

Wait, perhaps the reaction conditions (reagent) influence whether the product's configuration is R or S.

If, for example, reducing with LiBH4 leads to R configuration, and BH3 leads to S configuration, then the starting materials A and B must be the same to produce opposite configurations, but the question says that A and B are different.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials have different configurations, and each reagent leads to a specific configuration based on the starting material.

In that case, perhaps when the starting material is R and reduced with LiBH4, the product is R. When the starting material is S and reduced with BH3, the product is S.

So in option D, A is R and B is S. So when A is treated with LiBH4, product is R. When B is treated with BH3, product is S. So that fits the question.

Therefore, the correct option would be D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves determining the correct starting materials (A and B) for two reactions that yield enantiomeric products: (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. The reactions use different reducing agents: LiBH4 + H+ for A and BH3 + H+ for B. The key is to understand how the stereochemistry of the starting materials influences the stereochemistry of the products.

The starting materials are enantiomers: (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid and (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. The reduction of the ketone group in these compounds leads to the formation of a secondary alcohol, which then undergoes cyclization to form the cyclic ketone product. The stereochemistry of the product depends on the configuration of the starting material and the reducing agent.

When a ketone is reduced, the hydride approaches the carbonyl carbon from a specific face, determined by steric and electronic factors. The configuration of the starting material at the chiral center (C3) influences the approach of the hydride, leading to the formation of a specific enantiomer of the product. In this case:

1. **For A + LiBH4 + H+**: The starting material (A) is (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. The reduction and subsequent cyclization yield (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.
2. **For B + BH3 + H+**: The starting material (B) is (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. The reduction and cyclization yield (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.

Thus, the starting materials A and B must be enantiomers, and their configurations directly determine the stereochemistry of the products. The correct pairing is A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid and B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.

Answer: D
