Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it's about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds and finding their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Okay, I remember a bit about relativity from my studies, but I'm a bit rusty. Let me think through this step by step.

Alright, the problem states that there are two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system.

Wait, relative speed in relativity isn't just a simple subtraction like in classical mechanics, is it? Oh right, because when objects are moving at significant fractions of the speed of light, you can't just do a simple velocity addition. I remember something about the formula involving the addition of velocities under relativity. The formula is (u + v)/(1 + (uv)/c²), but wait, which direction are they moving? Oh, both are moving in the positive x-direction, so their velocities are in the same direction. So I need to find the relative velocity of one with respect to the other. Let me clarify: if astronaut A is moving at 0.6c and astronaut B at 0.5c in the same direction, then from A's frame, how fast is B moving?

Wait, no, wait. Let me think: in the problem, what's the context? Are they moving in the same reference frame, or are we considering their relative motion? I think the question is asking for the relative speed between them. So astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, astronaut B at 0.5c. So from A's perspective, what's B's speed?

Wait, no, wait. Wait, velocity addition in relativity is a bit tricky. The formula is (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/c²), because if u and v are in the same direction, you subtract them. Oh wait, no. Let me get the formula right. The correct formula for relative velocity when two objects are moving in the same direction is (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)), where u is the velocity of the object as observed from the other frame.

Wait no, wait: Let me think about the problem. If I'm in the frame of astronaut A, which is moving at 0.6c relative to the rest frame (let's say the rest frame is the Earth). Then, I want to find the velocity of astronaut B in that frame. So the Earth sees A moving at 0.6c, and B moving at 0.5c. So from A's frame, what's B's velocity?

Using the velocity addition formula: u' = (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/c²). Here, u is the velocity of B in Earth's frame, which is 0.5c. v is the velocity of A in Earth's frame, which is 0.6c. So substituting these values:

u' = (0.5c - 0.6c) / (1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/(c²)).

Simplify the numerator: 0.5c - 0.6c = -0.1c.

Denominator: 1 - (0.5 * 0.6) c² / c². The c² cancels, so 1 - (0.3) = 0.7.

So u' = (-0.1c) / 0.7 = approximately -0.142857 c. Wait, but the negative sign indicates that B is moving in the opposite direction relative to A. But wait, both were moving in the same direction in Earth's frame. Hmm, that seems a bit counterintuitive. So from A's frame, B is moving slower, but negative suggests it's moving opposite? That doesn't add up. Wait, maybe I got the formula wrong.

Wait, let me double-check the velocity addition formula. The formula is u' = (u + v)/(1 + (u v)/c²) when adding velocities in the same direction. Or is it (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/c²) when u is the velocity of an object in S and v is the velocity of S' relative to S? I think I might have mixed up the variables.

Wait, the standard formula is when you have an object moving at u in the S frame, and S' is moving at velocity v relative to S (along the x-axis). Then, the velocity of the object in S' is u' = (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/c²), right. So in this problem, S is Earth, and S' is moving at v = 0.6c (A's frame) relative to Earth. The object is B, moving at u = 0.5c in Earth's frame. So in A's frame, the velocity of B is u' = (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/c²) = (-0.1c)/(1 - 0.3) = (-0.1c)/0.7 = approximately -0.142857 c.

So that would be about -0.14c. But since speed is a scalar, the relative speed would be the magnitude, so 0.14c. Hmm, looking at the options, option C says v_rel = 0.14c and E=5.96 mc². Option D says v_rel=0.14c, E=5mc^2. So that's a possibility.

Wait, but wait another moment. Could I have messed up the formula? Let me think: If I'm in a frame moving at speed v relative to Earth, and I'm looking for the speed of an object moving at u in Earth's frame, is the formula (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/c²)? That's what I think. So if u is 0.5c and v is 0.6c in the same direction, then u' = (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/c²) = (-0.1c)/(1 - 0.3) = (-0.1c)/0.7 = approx -0.1428c. So the speed is 0.1428c, which is about 0.14c. So that's right. So the relative speed is 0.14c. So looking at the options, options C and D have this value.

Next, the total energy of the system. The total energy would be the sum of the relativistic energies of each astronaut. The relativistic energy is given by E = gamma * m c². Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So for astronaut A: mass is 2m, velocity is 0.6c.

Gamma_A = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.6c)^2/c^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.

So E_A = gamma_A * 2m c² = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

For astronaut B: mass is 3m, velocity is 0.5c.

Gamma_B = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547.

So E_B = 1.1547 * 3m c² ≈ 3.464 m c².

Adding E_A and E_B: 2.5 + 3.464 = approximately 5.964 m c².

Looking at the options: option C says E=5.96 mc², and option B has E=4.96. So option C's energy is 5.96, which matches our calculation.

So the relative speed is 0.14c and energy is ~5.96 mc². So option C is the one that has both correct.

To solve the problem, we need to determine the relative speed of the two astronauts and the total energy of the system.

### Step 1: Relative Speed
The relative speed of one astronaut with respect to the other in relativity is not a simple subtraction. Instead, the relativistic velocity addition formula is used:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{u - v}{1 - \frac{uv}{c^2}}
\]

Here:
- \(u = 0.5c\) (velocity of astronaut B in Earth's frame),
- \(v = 0.6c\) (velocity of astronaut A in Earth's frame).

Substituting the values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.5c - 0.6c}{1 - \frac{(0.5c)(0.6c)}{c^2}}
\]

Simplify the numerator:

\[
0.5c - 0.6c = -0.1c
\]

Simplify the denominator:

\[
1 - \frac{0.3c^2}{c^2} = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7
\]

Thus:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{-0.1c}{0.7} \approx -0.1428c
\]

The negative sign indicates the direction, but since speed is a scalar, the relative speed is:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c
\]

### Step 2: Total Energy of the System
The total energy of the system is the sum of the relativistic energies of the two astronauts. The relativistic energy is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2
\]

where \(\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}\).

#### For astronaut A:
- Mass = \(2m\),
- Velocity = \(0.6c\).

\[
\gamma_A = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.6c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = \frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25
\]

\[
E_A = \gamma_A \cdot 2m c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2
\]

#### For astronaut B:
- Mass = \(3m\),
- Velocity = \(0.5c\).

\[
\gamma_B = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.5c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]

\[
E_B = \gamma_B \cdot 3m c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464m c^2
\]

#### Total Energy:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_A + E_B = 2.5m c^2 + 3.464m c^2 \approx 5.964m c^2
\]

### Step 3: Match with Options
From the calculations:
- The relative speed is \(v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c\),
- The total energy is \(E \approx 5.96m c^2\).

Comparing with the options:
- Option C: \(v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c\), \(E = 5.96m c^2\),
- Option D: \(v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c\), \(E = 5m c^2\).

The correct answer is **Option C**, as it matches both the relative speed and the total energy.

**Answer: C**
