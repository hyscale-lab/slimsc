Okay, so I've got this question about neutrinos from the Sun and what happens if the pp-III branch stops. Hmm, I need to find the ratio of flux between two energy bands. Let me think this through step by step.

First, I remember that the Sun's core has different fusion processes. The main one is the proton-proton chain, which has branches. The pp-III branch is a part of that. Oh right, the pp-I, pp-II, and pp-III branches all contribute to the fusion process. The question says the pp-III branch stops, so the others remain the same.

Neutrinos are produced in these fusion reactions. The main type is the electron neutrino, right? The pp-III branch produces neutrinos, probably in specific energy ranges. I think the neutrinos from the proton-proton chain (like in the pp branches) have lower energies than those from other processes like the CNO cycle or the triple-alpha process, but wait, no—the CNO cycle produces higher energy neutrinos?

Wait, no, the neutrinos from the proton-proton chain actually have lower energies. The CNO cycle produces higher-energy neutrinos because the temperatures are higher where that process occurs. So, the pp branches (like pp-I, II, III) contribute more to the lower-energy neutrinos. The pp-III branch, perhaps, contributes to a specific part of that lower-energy spectrum.

If the pp-III branch stops, the production of neutrinos in that specific energy range would drop. The question is about two bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). So, if pp-III stops, what's the effect on these bands?

I think the pp-III branch produces neutrinos in the lower energy ranges. Let's see, the main solar neutrinos come from the proton-proton chain, with most having energies around 200 keV to maybe 800 keV or so. The CNO neutrinos are higher energy, like above 1 MeV perhaps. So, pp-III might be contributing to the 700-800 keV range, maybe even a bit higher.

So, if the pp-III branch stops, neutrinos in the 700-800 keV band (band 1) would decrease. But what about band 2, 800-900 keV? Does pp-III contribute there as well? Or is that maybe more from the CNO cycle?

Wait, the CNO cycle occurs in hotter and denser regions than the pp chain. So the neutrinos from CNO would have higher energies. So, if pp-III is stopped, the neutrinos in the lower bands (like 700-800) would drop, but the higher bands (like 800-900) might not be affected as much because they're from CNO.

But wait, the question says that all other reactions remain as they were. So the CNO reactions are continuing, producing their neutrinos. So, if the pp-III stops, the flux in band 1 (700-800) will decrease, but the flux in band 2 (800-900) will stay the same, since it's mainly CNO.

So the question is about the ratio flux(band1)/flux(band2). If band1 goes down a lot, and band2 stays about the same, the ratio would be lower than 1. How much lower?

I remember that the neutrino flux from the pp branches is much higher in the lower energy ranges. So if the pp-III stops, the neutrinos in band1 might drop by a significant factor. Let's think about the production rates.

The pp-III branch is responsible for a certain fraction of the total neutrino flux. Let me think, the pp-I and pp-II are the main contributors, but pp-III is a minor part. Wait, or is pp-III a significant part? I'm a bit fuzzy on that.

Wait, I think the pp-III branch is the dominant branch. Or is it? No, I think the pp-I and pp-II branches are more dominant. Wait, the pp chain is the main fusion process in the Sun. The pp chain has multiple branches, with pp-I and pp-II being more common. The pp-III branch is a minor part. So if it stops, the neutrinos from that specific energy range would drop, but the overall neutrino flux wouldn't drop much because other branches are still running.

But wait, the question is only about the pp-III branch stopping. So the total neutrino flux from the pp chain would decrease, but only in certain energy bands.

Another angle: the neutrino energy spectrum. If only the pp-III stops, which part of the spectrum is affected? The main neutrino flux peaks around a few hundred keV, I think. The pp-III branch might contribute to the higher end of that, like 700-800 keV.

If pp-III stops, the neutrinos in that band would come only from the other branches (like pp-I and pp-II), which might be less. But wait, do pp-I and pp-II produce the same neutrino energies as pp-III?

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III branch produces a specific high-energy neutrino. For instance, in the pp-III branch, the reaction might produce higher-energy neutrinos compared to pp-I and II.

So if pp-III stops, the higher-energy part of the neutrino flux (like above 700 keV) would drop, but the lower parts (like below 700 keV) would remain similar.

But the bands in question are 700-800 and 800-900 keV. Let's say band1 is 700-800 and band2 is 800-900. If pp-III is a major source for neutrinos in band1, then band1's flux would drop significantly, while band2, which is higher, might not be as affected because it's more from CNO or other sources.

Wait, but if CNO produces higher energy neutrinos, maybe band2 is more from CNO. So if pp-III stops, band1 flux goes down, but band2 is similar, maybe even a bit higher because it's CNO which is unaffected.

Wait, but the question is about the ratio of band1 to band2. So if band1 decreases more than band2 (if band2 doesn't change much, or even increases a bit, but that seems unlikely), the ratio will be smaller.

But I'm not entirely sure about how the flux is distributed between the bands. Let me think about the energy distribution.

In the Sun, the main neutrinos are from the pp chain, which has a broad spectrum but peaks around a few hundred keV. The CNO neutrinos come from a hotter region and have higher energies, so their flux increases with energy up to a point.

So, the total flux at higher energies (like 800-900 keV) is a combination of the pp chain and maybe the CNO. But wait, the CNO's contribution is a smaller fraction of the total neutrinos, since the Sun is not massive enough for the CNO cycle to dominate. The pp chain produces the majority of the neutrinos.

Hmm. So if the pp-III branch stops, the neutrinos in the higher energy part (like 700-800 and 800-900 keV) would decrease, but the CNO contribution is small. So the overall flux in band1 and band2 would drop, but perhaps band1 is more affected.

Wait, but the way the question is framed: the pp-III branch stopping, which part of the neutrino spectrum is most affected? The pp chain in general produces lower-energy neutrinos, so if a branch of the pp chain stops, the flux in the lower part of the pp spectrum would decrease.

Wait, the neutrino energies depend on the reaction. For example, in the dominant pp-I branch, the main neutrino production is when a boron-8 decays into two neutrinos. Oh wait, no, actually, the pp chain produces neutrinos in the beta-plus decays during the process.

Wait, maybe I should think about the energy distribution. The pp chain has a characteristic energy spectrum, with a peak around, say, 400 keV. The CNO neutrinos have higher energies, perhaps starting around 1 MeV, but I'm not sure.

So the neutrino flux from the pp chain is higher in the lower energy range (like up to 800 keV), and the CNO adds at higher energies. So, if the pp-III branch is a part of the pp chain that contributes to the higher end of the pp neutrino spectrum (like 700-800 keV), then stopping it would significantly reduce the flux in band1.

Band2, 800-900, might be less affected by the pp-III stoppage because it's either in the higher end of the pp chain (if pp-III doesn't contribute much there) or starts getting into the CNO range. Wait, but if CNO is a smaller contributor, then even if pp-III is part of the pp chain, and the pp chain contributes to the higher energies up to 800-900, then the flux in band2 would also decrease, but perhaps less than band1.

Wait, no. If pp-III is a branch that mainly contributes to the 700-800 keV range, then stopping it would decrease band1 more than band2. So the ratio (band1/band2) would decrease. But why?

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III branch contributes neutrinos that have energies in the 700-800 keV range, and maybe a bit into the 800-900. So if the pp-III stops, band1's flux (700-800) would decrease by a certain factor, and band2's (800-900) would decrease by a similar factor or a bit less if some of their neutrinos are from other branches.

Wait, but the main point is that the pp-III is responsible for a larger fraction of the neutrinos in band1 than in band2. So, the flux in band1 would drop more than band2. So the ratio would decrease.

But how much? The options are 10, 0.01, 1, 0.1.

Wait, let's try to model it.

Suppose that the pp-III contributes a significant fraction to band1 but not as much to band2. So, if the pp-III stops, band1's flux drops by, say, 10 times or 100 times, while band2's flux drops by less.

Wait, but the options don't have a 0.1 or 0.01 depending on that.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the relative contributions. Let's say the pp-III contributes 10% of the total neutrino flux in band1 and 5% in band2. Then, if pp-III stops, the flux in band1 would drop by 10%, and band2 by 5%. So the new flux ratio would be (0.9F1)/(0.95F2) ≈ (F1/F2) * (0.9/0.95) → so slightly less than the original ratio, but the original ratio is maybe 1?

Wait, perhaps the original flux ratio is around 1. So if F1_original is roughly equal to F2_original, then after pp-III stops, F1 becomes F1_original * (1 - x), and F2 becomes F2_original * (1 - y), where x > y.

Wait, but I'm not sure about the original ratio. Another approach: the neutrino spectrum from the Sun peaks around lower energies. So, higher energy bands have lower flux. But the pp chain contributes more at lower energies, so the peak is around, say, 200 keV, and the flux falls off with increasing energy.

If the pp-III branch is the main contributor to the higher end of the pp neutrino spectrum (like 700-800 keV), then removing it would create a drop in that particular band.

But without knowing the exact energy distribution, it's a bit tricky. But the question states that the neutrinos in band1 and band2 are considered. So the ratio is about their relative fluxes.

If the pp-III contributes more to band1 than band2, then the flux in band1 drops more, so the ratio (band1 / band2) would be less than 1.

But what if band2 is in a region where the pp chain isn't contributing much? Then, band2 is more from CNO. So if pp-III stops, band1 (pp contribution) decreases, but band2 (CNO) remains same. So the ratio could drop significantly.

For example, if originally the flux in band1 is 90% from pp-III and 10% from CNO, and band2 is 90% from CNO and 10% from pp-III. Then, stopping pp-III would make band1 flux drop by 90%, but band2 only by 10%.

So, F1_new = F1_old * 0.10, F2_new = F2_old * 0.90.

Assuming F1_old and F2_old were, say, 100 and 100 units. So F1_new = 10, F2_new = 90. Ratio = 10/90 ≈ 0.111.

Which is approximately 0.1, which is option D.

Alternatively, if the original ratio was 1, and now it's about 0.1, the ratio would be 0.1.

So the answer would be D) 0.1.

The question involves analyzing the effect of the sudden stoppage of the pp-III branch in the Sun's core on the flux of neutrinos in two energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). The pp-III branch is a part of the proton-proton chain, which primarily produces lower-energy neutrinos. The CNO cycle, occurring in hotter regions, contributes neutrinos at higher energies.

If the pp-III branch stops, the production of neutrinos in the lower-energy range (700-800 keV) would decrease significantly, as the pp-III branch is a major contributor to this band. In contrast, the higher-energy band (800-900 keV) is less affected by the pp-III branch, as it is primarily dominated by the CNO cycle, which remains unaffected. Therefore, the flux in band 1 decreases more than in band 2.

Assuming the original flux ratio between band 1 and band 2 was approximately 1, the stoppage of the pp-III branch would cause band 1's flux to drop significantly while band 2's flux remains relatively stable. This would result in a flux ratio of approximately 0.1 (band 1/band 2).
