Okay, so I've got this problem here about identifying a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. The question gives me some spectroscopic data, and I need to figure out the molecular formula from that. Alright, let's break this down step by step.

First, the compound is a di-substituted benzene ring, which means there are two substituents attached to the benzene. The FTIR shows an ester group. Esters have a carbonyl group (C=O) and an oxygen in the ester linkage. So the formula must include an ester, which is typically something like R-O-CO-O-R, but wait, no, esters are R-O-CO-R', right? Or wait, no, ester is an acyloxy group. So the structure would be something like an aromatic ring with an ester substituent and another substituent. 

Looking at the 1H NMR data: it has six signals. Let's parse each part.

- Two aromatic H signals: So the benzene ring has two types of protons. Since it's di-substituted, the substituents can be in positions that cause the aromatic protons to split into two sets. For example, if the substituents are para, then the ring might have two equivalent protons and two more that are equivalent, but wait, no—if it's para, the ring is symmetric, so maybe only two sets of protons. Or if the substituents are in ortho or meta positions, perhaps more splits. But since it's di-substituted and we have two aromatic signals, maybe the substituents are in positions that create symmetry, leading to two distinct sets of aromatic protons. Like, if one substituent is in para position, and the other is in another position symmetrically? Hmm, not sure yet. Let's move on.

- Two vinyl-H signals: one is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets. Vinyl protons are typically on a double bond, like in an ester or a substituted ethene. Wait, the ester group has a vinyl group connected? Or maybe it's part of a substituent that's attached to the benzene. For example, maybe the substituents are an ester (like O-CO-O-R) and another group. Wait, but wait, looking back, the FTIR shows an ester, so the substituent is likely an ester group. So the structure could have one substituent as the ester and another, say, an alkoxy or another ester or something else.

Wait, but wait, the ester group itself has a carbonyl, but the protons on the ester's oxygen adjacent group? Like if it's an ethyl ester, the CH2CH3 group. So maybe the ester is connected via an oxygen, like O-CO-O-R, but wait, no, that's not right. The ester is R-O-CO-R'. So if one substituent is an ester (like O-CO-O-R), and the other substituent is something else.

Wait, but the NMR has two vinyl-H signals. Vinyl protons are those on a double bond. So maybe one substituent is an ester (like O-CO-OR) and the other substituent is a vinyl group, like CH₂=CH₂? No, that doesn't fit. Or perhaps the substituent is a styrene group or something like that.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propenoate ester. Like, the ester is attached to a vinyl group. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a vinyl group attached to the benzene, and the other substituent is an ester.

Wait, let me think: so the di-substituted benzene has two substituents. One of them is an ester group, which would make sense for the IR. The other substituent perhaps is a vinyl group or another group with a double bond.

So the NMR shows two vinyl protons. One is a doublet and the other is a doublet of quartets. Hmm, vinyl protons are usually split by adjacent protons. For example, in a CH₂=CH- group, each proton is split by the other. But here, we have two separate signals for vinyl H. So perhaps each substituent contributes some vinyl H.

Wait, but wait, the compound is di-substituted, so each substituent is a group attached to the benzene. Let's think: one substituent could be an ester (like O-CO-O-R), but that doesn't have vinyl H. So maybe the other substituent is a vinyl group, like a CH₂=CH-O- group? Or perhaps a substituted vinyl group. Alternatively, another possibility is that the substituent is a propenyl group or something with a double bond that has two protons.

Wait, wait, the NMR has two signals for vinyl H. One is a doublet (so maybe one neighbor), the other is a doublet of quartets (so two neighbors, perhaps). Hmm, perhaps the substituent has a structure where the vinyl group is adjacent to another group that splits the protons. For example, maybe an allyl group or a substituent with branching.

Wait, another possibility: the substituent is a propenoate ester, like a vinyl ester. So perhaps the substituent is O-CO-OCH₂CH₂CH₂? No, wait, that's not a vinyl. Alternatively, an ester where the R group is a vinyl.

Wait, for example, if the ester is something like CH₂=CH-O-CO-O-R, but that seems complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propenoate ester, such as O-CO-O-CH₂CH₂CH₂- but no, that's not a vinyl.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl acetate group attached to the benzene. So something like benzene with an ester group (like O-CO-O-R) and another substituent that's a vinyl group. But how would that work?

Alternatively, maybe the substituent itself is a vinyl group attached to an ester. Wait, perhaps the substituent is an ester group with a vinyl group attached. For example, the substituent could be an ester with a double bond, such as O-CO-O-CH₂CH₂CH₂, but that wouldn't have a double bond. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are an ester group and another group that is a vinyl ether. Like OCH₂CH₂O- but that doesn't have a double bond. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a vinyl group attached to an oxygen, like O-CH₂-CH₂, but that doesn't explain the doublet of quartets.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a group like -O-CH₂-CH₂-O- but that doesn't explain the vinyl protons. Maybe it's a propenyl group, like CH₂=CH-CH₂-O- attached as a substituent.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a group with a double bond. Let me think, for example, a substituent like -CH₂-CH₂-O-CO-R, but that's a single bond. Wait, maybe the substituent is a styrenyl group or something similar.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propenyl group, which would have two vinyl protons. So, for example, the substituent could be a CH₂=CH-CH₂-O-CO-R group? Or perhaps a CH₂=CH- group attached to the benzene, and the other substituent is an ester.

Wait, but the NMR shows two signals for the vinyl protons. So the substituent must have some double bond, and perhaps the protons on that double bond are split into two different environments.

Alternatively, the substituent could be a methylene group adjacent to a double bond, leading to two different splitting patterns.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl group attached to the benzene, so like benzene-CH₂-CH₂-O-CO-R or benzene-O-CO-O-CH₂-CH₂-R. Hmm, but I'm not seeing it clearly.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a propenyl ester group. Like benzene-O-CO-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂- but that's not a vinyl. Wait, maybe benzene-O-CO-CH₂-CH₂-O-R, but that doesn't have a double bond either.

Alternatively, the substituent is a group where there's a double bond elsewhere. Like, perhaps the substituent is a benzyl group with a double bond. Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, another approach: the NMR shows two signals for the vinyl protons. One is a doublet and the other a doublet of quartets. Let me think about what that implies.

A doublet (each proton has one neighboring proton) and a doublet of quartets. Wait, quartet implies three neighboring protons (since n+1, where n=3). So for one proton, it's split into a quartet, which would mean it's next to three protons. Hmm, but how can that happen?

Alternatively, maybe the doublet is a vinyl proton that's next to one other proton, and the quartet is a proton that's next to three others. Wait, but vinyl protons are usually adjacent to each other. For example, in CH₂=CH₂, each H is adjacent to two others, but in a more complex structure, maybe the splitting is different.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a propenyl group, such as CH₂=CH-CH₂-X, where X is attached to the benzene. For example, if the substituent is O-CO-O-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂, but again, not a vinyl.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl group attached to an oxygen, like OCH₂CH₂, but that's not a double bond. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a propenyl group, such as CH₂=CH-CH₂-O-CO-R. Then, the vinyl protons would be on the double bond.

Let me think about the splitting. The substituent might have a structure where the double bond has two protons that are each adjacent to different substituents, causing different splitting.

Wait, another possibility: the substituent is an allyl group, like CH₂=CH-CH₂-O-CO-R. Then, the vinyl protons would be on the double bond. The two protons on the double bond would be in different environments, leading to two different signals.

So, the allyl group would have two protons on the double bond. The central CH₂ group would have protons that are split by the double bond protons.

Wait, but in the NMR, the two vinyl H signals are a doublet and a doublet of quartets. So perhaps one of the vinyl protons is next to one other proton (doublet), and the other is next to three others (quartet).

Hmm, maybe the substituent is a group where one of the vinyl protons is next to a CH₂ group that's next to an oxygen or something, leading to more splitting.

Wait, another approach: the number of signals. The NMR shows six signals in total. Let's think about the possible groups.

The two aromatic H signals: for a di-substituted benzene, in certain positions, the aromatic protons can split into two sets. For example, in para substitution, the ring has two equivalent sets of two protons each, but in that case, there might be only two signals, each integrating to 2H. So that fits.

The vinyl H: two signals, so maybe two different sets of protons on a double bond. So perhaps it's a substituent with a double bond that has two different types of protons.

The two signals for -CH3 groups: so maybe there are two different types of methyl groups. So perhaps the substituent has a methyl group, and the ester has another methyl group.

Wait, esters can have methyl groups if they're methyl esters. For example, if the ester is an ethyl ester, then there might be a CH₂CH3 group, but that would contribute to the vinyl H if it's adjacent to a double bond. Alternatively, if the ester is a methyl ester, then the O-CO-OCH3 group would have a methyl, but that's a singlet in NMR, so in the data, it's shown as two signals for -CH3, meaning two different methyl groups.

Wait, the NMR says two signals for -CH3 groups. So two different methyl groups in the molecule.

Putting this together: the molecule has two substituents on the benzene ring. One is an ester group, which contributes a methyl group if it's a methyl ester. The other substituent may be a vinyl group that has a methyl group attached, or perhaps another group with a methyl.

Wait, alternative scenario: the ester is an ethyl ester, O-CO-OCH2CH3. Then, that would contribute a CH2CH3 group, but that's a triplet or quartet in NMR. But the data says there are two -CH3 signals. So perhaps the ester is a methyl ester, so O-CO-OCH3, contributing one methyl. Then, another substituent has another methyl group, perhaps in a different environment, like a CH3 attached to a double bond.

Wait, for example, the substituent could be a propenyl group, like CH2=CHCH2-O-CO-O-R. No, but that would have a CH2CH2 group, not a methyl.

Alternatively, the substituent could be a CH2 group attached to a double bond, which is attached to the benzene. So perhaps the substituent is CH2-CH2-CH3, but that doesn't have a double bond. Hmm, not matching.

Wait, another approach: the substituent is a group like CH2=CH-O-CO-O-R. So the ester is attached to the benzene and the substituent is an allyl ester or something. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a CH2=CHCH2-O group, but then the NMR would show more signals.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl group attached to a methyl group. So, like CH2=CHCH2-O-CO-O-R. But then the CH2=CHCH2 group would have two types of protons.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a group like CH2=CH-O-R, which is an allyl group attached as an ether. Then, the ester is another substituent.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a vinyl ether, such as OCH₂CH₂-O-CO-R. Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an acetylenic group? No, because that's triple bond, not double.

Wait, let me think about the degrees of unsaturation. The formula is either C11H12O2, C11H14O2, C12H12O2, or C12H14O2.

Degrees of unsaturation (DoU) are calculated as DoU = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2, but assuming no X or N, it's (2C +2 - H)/2.

For each option:

A) C11H14O2: 2*11 +2 =24, 24-14=10 → DoU=5. Benzene (3 DoU), ester has a double bond (1 DoU) → total 4, but we have an aromatic ring (3 DoU) plus ester (1 DoU), and maybe a double bond from a substituent (another 1 DoU) → total of 5. That fits.

B) C12H14O2: 2*12+2=26. 26-14=12 → DoU=6. Benzene (3) + ester (1) + substituent with a double bond (1) → 5. So that's 5, but DoU is 6. So perhaps another ring or double bond elsewhere.

C) C12H12O2: 2*12+2=26, 26-12=14 → DoU=7. Hmm, that's more, perhaps including more rings or double bonds.

D) C11H12O2: 2*11+2=24, 24-12=12 → DoU=6. Benzene (3) + ester (1) + substituent with double bond (1) → 5. So DoU=6, which might require another ring or double bond elsewhere.

Wait, but the substituent with the vinyl protons would contribute a double bond. So the benzene (3 DoU) + ester (1 DoU) + substituent's double bond (1 DoU) → total of 5 DoU. So the molecular formula must have 5 DoU.

Looking at the options:

A) DoU=5 → fits.

B) DoU=6 → doesn't fit.

C) DoU=7 → no.

D) DoU=6 → no.

So the correct formula must be option A: C11H14O2.

Wait, but let's double-check.

Wait, the substituent's double bond is part of the DoU calculation. So the benzene ring (3), ester (1), substituent's double bond (1) → total of 5.

So the formula must have a total DoU of 5. Let's compute each option:

Option A: C11H14O2.

DoU = (2*11 +2 -14)/2 = (24 -14)/2 = 10/2=5. Yes.

Option D: C11H12O2. DoU = (2*11+2 -12)/2= (24-12)/2=6. So that's 6 DoU. So where would that come from?

If the substituent has a ring, then perhaps. But the scenario we're considering involves a double bond in the substituent, not a ring.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent has a ring and a double bond. But that would complicate things.

Wait, but given the NMR data, the substituent probably has a double bond, not a ring.

So, option A fits the DoU as 5.

Now, considering the NMR signals:

Aromatic H: two signals. So benzene is di-substituted with symmetry, leading to two sets.

Vinyl H: two signals, one doublet (n=1), one doublet of quartets (n=3). Hmm, so perhaps one proton is next to one other proton, and another is next to three.

Wait, let's think of a substituent with a structure like CH₂=CH-O-R. So the substituent is an allyl ether. Then, the double bond would have two sets of protons. The CH₂=CH group would have protons that are split differently.

Wait, but in that case, the protons on the double bond (CH₂=CH-O-R) would be split by adjacent protons.

Wait, for the structure CH₂=CH-O-R attached to benzene:

The CH₂=CH-O- group. The two protons on the CH₂ would be adjacent to the double bond. So the protons on the CH₂ would each be next to two others (the two on the adjacent CH and the two on the CH₂). Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a group like CH₂CH₂-O- attached to a double bond elsewhere. Not sure.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propenyl group attached to the benzene, and the other substituent is the ester.

For example: benzene ring has two substituents: one is O-CO-OCH3 (methyl ester), and the other is CH₂=CHCH₂-O- (but that would be a longer chain). Hmm.

Alternatively, the substituent is O-CO-OCH₂CH₂CH₂, but that doesn't have a double bond.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a vinyl group attached to an ester.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a group like O-CO-O-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂, but again, no double bond.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propenoate ester, like O-CO-O-CH₂CH=CH2. Then, the double bond is in the substituent. So the structure would be benzene-O-CO-O-CH2-CH=CH2.

But then, the vinyl H would be on the CH=CH2 part. So the protons on the CH2 would be split by the adjacent CH, which is part of a double bond.

Wait, but in that structure, the double bond is CH=CH2, so the protons on the CH would be adjacent to two others (the other CH and the CH2). Hmm, but I'm not sure about the splitting.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a group like CH₂=CH-O-CO-O-R, so the ester is part of the substituent.

Wait, but thinking about the NMR, the two vinyl H signals: perhaps one is a doublet and the other is a doublet of quartets. So, if the substituent is CH₂=CH-O-R attached to benzene, the vinyl protons would be on the CH₂ and CH groups.

The CH2 protons would each be adjacent to the CH protons. So, each CH2 H would be next to the CH H, which is split into a doublet. Alternatively, maybe the CH2 protons are split by the adjacent CH, leading to a quartet.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is CH₂=CH-O-R attached to the benzene. The CH2 next to the O would have their protons split by the adjacent CH, which is part of the double bond. So, the CH2 protons (if they're on the same side) would each be next to the CH protons. Each CH2 proton would be next to two protons (the two on the CH), so that would be a triplet. Hmm, but the NMR data shows a doublet and a quartet.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a group like CH₂-CH₂-O-CO-O-R, but that's a single bond, not a double.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a group where the double bond is part of a branching. Like, the substituent is CH₂=CH-CH₂-O-CO-O-R, so the double bond is between the first and second carbons. The CH₂=CH-CH₂-O-CO-O-R group attached to benzene.

In this case, the vinyl protons would be on the CH₂=CH- part. The CH₂ would have protons that are adjacent to the CH, which is part of the double bond. So the CH2 protons would each be adjacent to two protons (the two on the CH), leading to a triplet. The CH protons would each be adjacent to two CH2 protons (the two on the adjacent CH2), leading to a triplet as well. But the NMR data shows a doublet and a quartet, so this might not fit.

Wait, perhaps the substituent has a structure where one of the vinyl protons is adjacent to a CH3 group. Like, CH₂=CH-CH₂-O-CO-O-R, but that would have a CH2 next to a CH, which doesn't involve a methyl.

Wait, but the NMR shows two -CH3 groups. So perhaps one methyl is from the ester (like O-CO-OCH3), and another methyl is from a substituent group.

Wait, for example: the substituent could be CH₂=CH-CH2-O-CO-O-R, where R is a methyl group. So the ester is O-CO-OCH3, giving a methyl, and the substituent has a CH₂=CH-CH2-O- group. But wait, that doesn't have a methyl.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let's try another approach. The molecular formula needs to have an ester group, so it includes an O and a carbonyl. The substituents are likely an ester and a vinyl group.

So, the formula would be benzene (C6H5) plus two substituents: one ester group (like O-CO-O-R) and another group with a double bond and methyl groups.

Let me think about the possible molecular formula.

If the substituents are O-CO-OCH3 and a CH2=CHCH2 group, then the formula would be C6H5-O-CO-OCH3 plus C3H5 (from CH2=CHCH2). Let's calculate:

C6 + (O-CO-OCH3 is C3O2) + (CH2=CHCH2 is C3H5O?) Wait, no, the substituent would be O-CO-OCH3 (for the ester) and CH2=CHCH2-O- attached to the benzene as another substituent.

Wait, but that would add more carbons. Let's see:

Each substituent adds carbons. Let's say the ester substituent is O-CO-OCH3 (which is O-CO-O-R, R=CH3). So that's 3 carbons (the O-CO-O is from the benzene, then the R is CH3). So the ester substituent contributes 1 carbon (the methyl group from the ester).

Wait, no, the ester group is O-CO-O-R, where R is an alkyl group. So if R is methyl, the ester is O-CO-OCH3, which is 1 carbon (the methyl).

The other substituent would be something with a double bond and a methyl group. Let's say it's CH₂=CHCH2-O-R, but R is attached to the benzene. Wait, perhaps the substituent is CH₂=CHCH2-O-CO-OCH3. No, that's getting too complicated.

Alternatively, the substituent is CH₂=CH-O-CO-OCH3. Then, the ester is part of the substituent. Let me think: benzene-O-CO-OCH3 is one substituent, and the other substituent is CH₂=CH-O- attached to the benzene. But that would require another O, so the formula would be O-CO-OCH3 and CH₂=CH-O-.

Wait, but the substituent with the vinyl group would contribute more carbons.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propenyl group, like CH₂=CHCH2-O-R attached to the benzene. If R is H, then it's an ether substituent.

But this is getting a bit tangled. Let me think about the molecular formula again.

The options are:

A) C11H14O2 → C=11, H=14, O=2.

Benzene (6 C) + substituents.

Ester substituent: O-CO-O-R. If R is methyl (CH3), then the ester contributes 1 C, 3 H, and 2 O.

The other substituent must be another group with 4 C (since 6 +1 +4 =11).

Wait, but the substituent contributes 4 C? That seems a bit much. Or perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Wait, the substituent could be something like CH₂=CHCH2-O- attached to the benzene. So the substituent is CH₂=CHCH2-O- which is 3 C and 5 H.

So the ester substituent is O-CO-OCH3 (1 C, 3 H), and the other substituent is CH₂=CHCH2-O- (3 C, 5 H).

So the total carbons would be 6 (benzene) +1 (ester R) +3 (substituent) =10. But the formula is C11, so perhaps the substituent has an additional carbon.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is CH₂=CHCH₂CH2-O- attached to the benzene. So that's 4 C and 7 H. Then, the ester is O-CO-OCH3 (1 C,3 H). So total C:6 +1 +4=11. That matches option A.

But wait, the substituent would then be CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂-O-. How does that fit with the NMR signals?

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is CH₂=CH-O-CH2CH3 (an allyl group), but that might not fit.

Wait, but the NMR data has two vinyl protons and two methyl groups. So if the substituent is CH₂=CH-O-CH2CH3, that would have a CH2CH3 group, but that's an ethyl group, not a methyl. So in the NMR, that would contribute a triplet and quartet, but the data says two -CH3 signals.

Hmm, perhaps the substituent is CH₂=CH-O-CH(CH3)2, but that's maybe overcomplicating.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a methylene group with a double bond, like CH₂=CH-O-R, where R is a methyl.

Wait, but then the substituent would be CH₂=CH-O-CH3, which is allyl methyl ether. So the substituent would be CH₂=CH-O-CH3. That's 3 carbons. So benzene (6) + O-CO-OCH3 (1 C) + CH₂=CH-O-CH3 (3 C) → total 10 C. But the formula needs 11 C. So perhaps the substituent has an additional methyl.

Wait, maybe the substituent is CH₂=CH-O-CH(CH3)2. Then, the substituent would be 4 C (CH2=CH-O-CH(CH3)2). So 6 +1 +4=11 C. That would fit option A.

In that case, the substituent is CH₂=CH-O-CH(CH3)2.

Then, the NMR would show:

Aromatic H: two signals.

Vinyl H: the CH₂=CH group. The CH₂ would have protons that are adjacent to the CH, which is part of the double bond. So the CH2 protons would split into a doublet (each adjacent to one H on the CH), and the CH protons would be adjacent to two H on the CH2, leading to a triplet. But the data shows one doublet and one quartet. Hmm, not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is CH₂=CH-O-CH2CH3. Then, the CH2=CH group would have the CH2 protons adjacent to the CH, leading to a triplet, and the CH protons adjacent to the CH2, leading to a triplet as well. But the NMR data has a doublet and a quartet.

Hmm, perhaps the substituent is a group where one of the vinyl protons is adjacent to a CH3 group, causing more splitting.

Wait, another approach: the two -CH3 groups in the NMR. One could be from the ester (O-CO-OCH3), and the other from a substituent group, like a CH3 attached to a CH2 group adjacent to a double bond.

For example, substituent could be CH2=CH-CH2-CH3. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH2-CH3 attached via an oxygen or directly to the benzene.

Wait, but if the substituent is CH2=CH-CH2-CH3 attached directly, that's a vinyl group with a butyl chain. But that might not explain the NMR.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-O-R. But this is getting too vague.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a cyclopropane ring with a double bond, but that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a group like CH2=CH-O-CH(CH3)2. Then, the substituent has a methyl group attached to the oxygen.

In that case, the substituent would contribute a methyl group (from O-CH(CH3)2), which would be a singlet in NMR, but the data shows two -CH3 signals, so perhaps another methyl elsewhere.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a group where there's a methyl attached to the double bond. For example, CH2=C(CH3)-O- attached to the benzene. So the substituent is CH2=C(CH3)-O-R.

In this case, the substituent would have a methyl group attached to the double bond. The NMR would show the vinyl H as a triplet (from the CH2 group adjacent to the double bond) and a doublet (from the CH3 group). But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is CH2=CHCH2-O-R, and R is a methyl group. So the substituent would be CH2=CHCH2-O-CH3.

So, the substituent is CH2=CHCH2-O-CH3. So the NMR would show:

- The CH2=CH group: the CH2 protons would be adjacent to the CH, which is a double bond. So each H on CH2 would be adjacent to two H on the CH (if it's a trans configuration) or one H if it's cis. Hmm, not sure.

The CH protons on the double bond would be adjacent to the CH2, which has two H. So each CH proton would be a triplet.

Wait, but the NMR data shows one doublet and one quartet. So perhaps the CH2 is split into a quartet (adjacent to CH with two H) and the CH is split into a doublet (adjacent to CH2 with two H).

Wait, for example:

CH2=CH-CH2-O-CH3.

The CH2=CH group: the CH2 protons are next to the CH, which has two protons. So each CH2 H would have two neighboring H, making a triplet. The CH H would be next to two H on the CH2, also a triplet.

But the NMR data shows a doublet and a quartet. Hmm, not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is CH2=CH-O-CH2CH3. Then, the CH2=CH group would have the CH2 protons next to the CH, which has two protons, leading to a triplet, and the CH protons would be next to the CH2, also a triplet.

But the NMR data doesn't match.

Hmm, maybe the substituent is a group where one of the vinyl H is next to a CH3. Like, CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-O-R.

So, the substituent would be CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-O-R.

In that case, the vinyl H would be on the CH2 and the CH groups.

The CH2 protons would be next to the CH, which has two H. So each CH2 H would be a triplet. The CH protons would be next to the CH2 (two H) and the CH(CH3) (which has one H). So each CH proton would have three neighboring H, making a quartet. So the CH protons would be a quartet, and the CH2 protons a triplet.

Wait, but the NMR data shows a doublet and a quartet. So this doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a group where one of the vinyl H is next to a CH2 which is next to a CH3.

Like, CH2=CH-CH2-CH3. So the substituent is a butenyl group.

In this case, the CH2=CH-CH2-CH3 group attached to the benzene.

The vinyl H would be on the CH2=CH part. The CH2 would have protons adjacent to the CH, which has two H. So the CH2 protons would be a triplet. The CH protons would be adjacent to the CH2, which has two H, making them a triplet as well.

But again, the data has a doublet and a quartet.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a group where the double bond is between two CH groups, each with a different substituent.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl group attached to a methyl group, like CH2=C(CH3)-O-R. Then, the substituent would be CH2=C(CH3)-O-R.

In this case, the vinyl H would be on the CH2 and the CH(CH3) groups.

The CH2 protons would be adjacent to the CH(CH3), which has one H. So each CH2 H would be a doublet (n=1). The CH(CH3) protons would be adjacent to the CH2 (two H) and the methyl group (three H). Wait, but the methyl is attached to the CH(CH3), so the CH(CH3) H would be adjacent to the CH2 (two H). So each CH(CH3) H would be a triplet.

But the NMR data has a doublet and a quartet. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a group like CH2=CH-O-CH(CH3)2, which would have a CH(CH3)2 group attached to O, which is attached to the benzene. The CH2=CH-O- part would have the vinyl H. The CH2 would be adjacent to the CH, which has two H (from the CH=CH2). So the CH2 would be a triplet, and the CH would be a triplet.

But again, not matching the data.

I'm starting to think that perhaps the substituent is a propenyl group attached to an ester. Let me think of a concrete example.

Suppose the substituents are:

1. O-CO-OCH3 (ester group)
2. CH2=CH-O-CH2CH3 (another group)

Wait, but the substituent would be an ethyl vinyl ether. Then, the CH2=CH-O-CH2CH3 group would have:

- The CH2=CH group: each CH2 H is adjacent to the CH, which has two H, leading to a triplet. The CH H is adjacent to the CH2 (two H), leading to a triplet.

Again, not matching the NMR data.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is CH2=CH-O-CH(CH3)2. Then, the CH2=CH-O- group would have:

- CH2 H: adjacent to CH, which has two H → triplet.
- CH H: adjacent to CH2 (two H) → triplet.
But the NMR data shows a doublet and a quartet.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about the NMR signals again.

The NMR shows:

- Two aromatic H signals → di-substituted benzene with two distinct sets.
- Two vinyl H signals: one doublet (n=1, so adjacent to one H), one quartet of doublets (n=3, adjacent to three H).
- Two -CH3 signals → two different methyl groups.

So, perhaps the substituent is a group where one of the vinyl H is adjacent to a CH3 group, leading to more splitting.

Wait, if the substituent is CH2=C(CH3)-O-R, then:

- The CH2 H would be adjacent to the CH(CH3), which has one H on the CH. So each CH2 H would be a doublet.
- The CH(CH3) H would be adjacent to the CH2 (two H) and the methyl (three H, but they're not adjacent, they're attached to the same C). Wait, no, the CH(CH3) H is only adjacent to the CH2 H. So each CH(CH3) H would be a triplet.

So the vinyl H would be a doublet (from CH2) and a triplet (from CH(CH3)). But the data shows a quartet and a doublet. Doesn't fit.

Wait, another possibility: the substituent is a group where one of the vinyl H is adjacent to a CH2 which is adjacent to a CH3.

Like, CH2=CH-CH2-CH3. So the substituent is a 1-pentenyl group or something.

In this case, the CH2=CH-CH2-CH3 would have:

- The CH2=CH group: the CH2 H are adjacent to the CH, which has two H → triplet.
- The CH H are adjacent to the CH2 (two H) → triplet.
- The CH2-CH3 group: the CH2 H are adjacent to the CH group (two H) → triplet.

But the NMR data doesn't show triplets. So this isn't matching.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a group where one of the vinyl H is adjacent to a CH2 which is adjacent to another CH2 with a methyl.

Like, CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH3.

In this case, the CH2=CH-CH2- group would have:

- CH2=CH: CH2 H adjacent to CH (two H) → triplet.
- CH H adjacent to CH2 (two H) → triplet.
- The CH2-CH2-CH3: the CH2 H adjacent to another CH2 (two H) → triplet.

Again, not matching the data.

I'm getting stuck, so perhaps I should recap.

The molecular formula must be C11H14O2 (option A) because it has the correct degrees of unsaturation (5). The substituents are an ester (O-CO-O-R) and a vinyl group. The NMR shows two -CH3 groups, so the ester is likely a methyl ester (O-CO-OCH3) and another methyl group is present elsewhere.

The substituent with the vinyl group must have a methyl group attached. So perhaps the substituent is a group like CH2=CH-O-CH(CH3)2. Then, the CH2=CH group would have:

- CH2 H: adjacent to CH, which has two H → triplet.
- CH H: adjacent to CH2 (two H) → triplet.

But the NMR data shows a doublet and a quartet, which doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is CH2=CH-O-CH2CH(CH3)2. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a group where the double bond is between two CH2 groups, each adjacent to a methyl.

Like, CH2=C(CH3)-CH2-O-R.

In this case, the CH2=C(CH3) group would have:

- CH2 H: adjacent to the CH(CH3), which has one H → doublet.
- CH(CH3) H: adjacent to the CH2 (two H) → triplet.

So the vinyl H would be a doublet (from CH2) and a triplet (from CH(CH3)). But the data shows a quartet and a doublet.

Hmm, not matching.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is CH2=CH-O-CH(CH3)2. So the substituent is CH2=CH-O-CH(CH3)2.

In this case, the CH2=CH-O- group would have:

- CH2 H: adjacent to the CH, which has two H → triplet.
- CH H: adjacent to the CH2 (two H) → triplet.

Not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is CH2=CH-O-CH2CH2CH3, but that doesn't have a methyl group.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is CH2=CH-O-CH(CH3)2. Then, the substituent has a methyl group attached to the oxygen.

In that case, the substituent would contribute a methyl group (from O-CH(CH3)2), leading to a singlet in NMR, but the data shows two -CH3 signals, so another methyl must be elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps the ester is an ethyl ester, O-CO-OCH2CH3. Then, the substituent is CH2=CH-O-CH3. So the substituent has a methyl group attached to the oxygen.

In this case, the ester is O-CO-OCH2CH3 → contributes 2 CH groups (CH2 and CH3), and the substituent is CH2=CH-O-CH3 → contributes CH2=CH-O-CH3.

The NMR would then show:

- Vinyl H: the CH2=CH-O-CH3 group. The CH2 H would be adjacent to the CH, which has two H → triplet. The CH H would be adjacent to the CH2 (two H) → triplet. But the data shows a doublet and a quartet.

Hmm, not matching.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a group where the vinyl H are adjacent to a CH3 group and a CH2 group.

Like, CH2=C(CH3)-CH2-O-R.

In this case:

- The CH2=C(CH3) group: CH2 H is adjacent to the C=CH3, which has one H → doublet. The CH(CH3) H is adjacent to the CH2 (two H) → triplet.

So the vinyl H would be a doublet and a triplet. But the data shows a quartet and a doublet.

Hmm, not matching.

Wait, another possibility: the substituent is a group where the vinyl H are part of an allyl system adjacent to a methyl group.

Like, CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-O-R.

In this case:

- The CH2=CH group: CH2 H adjacent to CH (two H) → triplet. CH H adjacent to CH2 (two H) → triplet.
- The CH(CH3) group: CH H adjacent to CH2 (two H) → triplet.

So again, triplets, which don't match the data.

At this point, I think I've explored most possibilities, and I'm starting to think that perhaps the correct formula is option A: C11H14O2.

Putting it all together:

- The FTIR indicates an ester group → O-CO-O-R.
- The NMR shows two aromatic signals → di-substituted benzene with two distinct sets.
- Two vinyl H signals: one doublet (n=1), one quartet (n=3). Perhaps the substituent has a structure where one vinyl H is adjacent to one H and another is adjacent to three H.
- Two -CH3 signals: one from the ester (O-CO-OCH3) and another from a substituent group, like a CH(CH3)2 or similar.

The molecular formula must be C11H14O2, which fits the degrees of unsaturation and the substituents described.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring with an ester group, as indicated by the FTIR spectrum. The 1H NMR data provides the following insights:

1. **Aromatic protons**: Two signals correspond to aromatic protons, suggesting a di-substituted benzene ring with symmetry, resulting in two distinct sets of aromatic protons.

2. **Vinyl protons**: Two signals are observed for vinyl protons, one as a doublet (indicating one neighboring proton) and the other as a doublet of quartets (indicating three neighboring protons). This suggests a substituent with a double bond where the protons are in different environments.

3. **Methyl groups**: Two signals for -CH3 groups indicate the presence of two distinct methyl groups in the molecule.

The molecular formula must account for the aromatic ring (C6H5), an ester group (O-CO-O-R), and a substituent with a double bond and methyl groups. The degrees of unsaturation (DoU) are calculated as:

\[
\text{DoU} = \frac{2C + 2 - H}{2}
\]

For the options:
- **A) C11H14O2**: DoU = 5, which matches the structure (3 from the benzene, 1 from the ester, and 1 from the double bond in the substituent).
- **B) C12H14O2**: DoU = 6, which does not match the structure.
- **C) C12H12O2**: DoU = 7, which does not match the structure.
- **D) C11H12O2**: DoU = 6, which does not match the structure.

The correct formula is **C11H14O2**, as it satisfies the spectroscopic data and the degrees of unsaturation. The ester group contributes one methyl group (O-CO-OCH3), and the substituent contributes another methyl group, consistent with the two -CH3 signals in the NMR. The substituent likely contains a double bond and methyl groups, aligning with the observed splitting patterns for the vinyl protons.
