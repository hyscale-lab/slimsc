Okay, so I need to figure out which stars can be detected by both ESPRESSO and HIRES spectrographs. Let me think about what I know.

First, I remember that both ESPRESSO and HIRES are high-resolution spectrographs used for various astronomical observations. The question gives me some details about their brightness limits. ESPRESSO can observe stars with apparent V magnitudes up to 17 mag, while HIRES can only go up to 16 mag. So, for a star to be detected by both, its apparent magnitude must be brighter than 17 mag? Wait, no, wait. Because if HIRES can only go up to 16 mag, then the star's apparent V must be less than or equal to 16 mag to be detected by HIRES. ESPRESSO goes up to 17, so any star with V <17 can be observed by ESPRESSO. But since HIRES can't go beyond 16, the star must have V <=16 to be detected by both.

Wait, no. Let me clarify. The statement says that ESPRESSO can observe stars with apparent V mag brighter than 17 mag. Wait, brighter stars have lower magnitudes. So, if a star is brighter than 17, that means its V magnitude is less than 17. So, for ESPRESSO, it can observe stars with V <17. HIRES can observe stars with V <16. So, the stars that both can detect must have V <16 because that's the stricter condition. Because a star with V=15 would be detectable by both, but a star with V=16.5 would only be detectable by ESPRESSO, not HIRES.

So the first thing I need to do is calculate the apparent V magnitude for each star and see which ones are less than 16.

Let's look at each star:

Star1: It has an absolute magnitude of 15.5 mag and is at 10 pc distance. Absolute magnitude (M) is the apparent magnitude (m) it would have at 10 pc. So if it's at 10 pc, m equals M. So m =15.5 mag. Since 15.5 is less than 16, it's detectable by both. Wait, but wait: Star1 is at 10 pc, so m = M =15.5. So yes, it's within both's limits.

Star2: Apparent V is 16.5. So this is above HIRES' limit (which is 16 mag). So HIRES can't detect it. But ESPRESSO can, since 16.5 <17. So Star2 can only be seen by ESPRESSO.

Star3: Apparent V is 15.5. But wait, the E(B-V) is 0.6 mag. Oh wait, I need to consider interstellar extinction. The star's apparent magnitude is given as 15.5, but there's extinction, which makes it appear fainter. Wait, but the question says that for Star3, the apparent V magnitude is 15.5, and E(B-V)=0.6. Wait, how does that affect the actual observed V?

Wait, the note says that the total absorption (extinction) in the V band is related to E(B-V) with a coefficient of 3.1. So the extinction A_V = 3.1 * E(B-V). So for Star3, A_V is 3.1 * 0.6 = 1.86 mag.

So the apparent magnitude is m = m_0 + A_V, where m_0 is the intrinsic magnitude without extinction. Wait, no, wait. Actually, the formula is m = M + 5 log10 (d/10) + A_V, where d is distance in parsecs. But Star3's apparent magnitude is given as m =15.5 mag, which already includes extinction? Or is that the observed magnitude?

Wait, the question says for Star3: apparent V magnitude of 15.5, and E(B-V)=0.6. So I'm a bit confused. The apparent magnitude as observed would have the extinction added, so m_observed = m_intrinsic + A_V.

Wait, no, the apparent magnitude is the observed one, which includes extinction. But the problem says that the apparent V is 15.5 mag. So that's what we measure. But wait, the absolute magnitude is the apparent magnitude at 10 pc without extinction. Hmm, perhaps I need to adjust for extinction to find the actual intrinsic brightness.

Wait, maybe I need to calculate the extinction-corrected apparent magnitude. Because for the purpose of determining detectability, the apparent magnitude as observed (which is what the instruments see) is what matters. Because the instruments' limits are based on the observed apparent magnitude.

Wait, no. Wait, the star's apparent magnitude (without extinction) would be brighter. So if a star has extinction, it appears fainter. So the observed apparent magnitude is m_obs = m_intrinsic + A_V. So the star's actual brightness (without extinction) would be m_obs - A_V. But for the purpose of detection, the instrument sees m_obs. So the instruments' limits are based on m_obs.

Wait, but the question says HIRES can observe stars with V mag brighter than 16 mag. So if the observed V mag is 16.5, it's too faint for HIRES. So Star2 is 16.5, which is too faint for HIRES but bright enough for ESPRESSO.

Wait, Star3's apparent V is 15.5, but with E(B-V)=0.6. So the observed V is 15.5. But maybe the extinction makes it appear dimmer than it actually is. Does that affect the detectability? Because the spectrophotometer measures the apparent magnitude as it is. So if Star3's observed V is 15.5, that's what matters for the instrument's limit.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. The apparent magnitude is what the instrument measures. So for example, if a star has an intrinsic brightness (without extinction) that would have made it m=14, but due to extinction, it's observed as m=15.5. So the instrument would see m=15.5, which is above the 16 limit for HIRES. But wait, in our case, the apparent magnitude for Star3 is given as 15.5, so it's already the observed value. So in that case, Star3's apparent V is 15.5, which is less than 16. So it's detectable by both.

Wait, but wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me clarify:

The apparent magnitude (m) is what an observer measures, which includes all effects like distance and extinction. So if Star3's m is 15.5, that's what the instrument sees. So for HIRES, which requires m <16, Star3 is acceptable. So Star3 is acceptable for both.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let's make a table.

Each star's apparent V:

Star1: m=15.5 (since M=15.5, d=10 pc. m = M +5log(d/10)=15.5 + 5log(1) = 15.5)

Star2: m=16.5

Star3: m=15.5

Star4: Let's calculate. Star4 has M=15.5, d=10 pc.

So m = M +5log(d/10) = 15.5 + 0 =15.5.

But Star4 has E(B-V)=0.4. So A_V=3.1 * 0.4 =1.24.

Wait, but Star4's apparent magnitude in the question is given as M=15.5, located at 10 pc. So without extinction, m would be 15.5. But with extinction, the observed m would be 15.5 +1.24=16.74. Wait, but that's not matching the data given in the question.

Wait, the question says for Star4: absolute V magnitude of 15.5, located at 10 pc, E(B-V)=0.4. So to find its observed apparent V magnitude, we calculate m_obs = M +5 log (d/10) + A_V.

M is 15.5, d=10, so 5 log(1)=0. So m_obs = 15.5 + (3.1 * 0.4) =15.5 +1.24=16.74 mag. So the observed apparent V is 16.74.

So Star4's apparent V is 16.74, which is way above both 16 and 17. So it can't be detected by either? Wait, but wait. The question says that the apparent V magnitudes for Star2 and Star3 are given; for Star1, Star4, and Star5, it's the absolute magnitude, and distance.

So, for Star4, the apparent V (observed) is 16.74, which is higher than 17 mag, so ESPRESSO can't detect it (since it requires V <17). So Star4 can't be detected by either.

Wait, but let me think again. Because, for Star4, the absolute magnitude is 15.5, which at 10 pc, without extinction, m would be 15.5. But with extinction, it's 15.5 +1.24=16.74. So observed m=16.74. So Star4's apparent V is 16.74, which is above both thresholds (16 and 17). So no, both ESPRESSO and HIRES can't detect Star4, as it's too faint.

Wait, but Star4's observed V is 16.74. ESPRESSO can go up to 17, so 16.74 is under 17. So Star4 can be detected by ESPRESSO but not by HIRES, since HIRES can't go beyond 16. So Star4 is only detectable by ESPRESSO.

Wait, no. Because 16.74 is above 16, so HIRES can't detect it. So Star4 can't be seen by either. Hmm, but what about Star5.

Star5: absolute V=16.5, located at 5 pc. So without extinction, m = M +5 log(d/10) = 16.5 +5 log(0.5) = 16.5 +5*(-0.3010)=16.5 -1.505=14.995, let's say ~15.0 mag. So m=15.0.

But Star5's E(B-V) isn't mentioned, so I assume it's zero? The question doesn't specify, so perhaps we can take E(B-V) as 0. So no extinction. So m=15.0. So this is less than 16. So Star5 can be detected by both.

Wait, but wait, the question states that Star5's absolute magnitude is 16.5, distance 5 pc. So using the distance modulus: m = M +5 log(d/10) =16.5 +5*(log(5/10)) =16.5 +5*(log(0.5))=16.5 +5*(-0.3010)=16.5 -1.505=14.995 ≈15.0.

So Star5's apparent V is 15.0, which is less than 16. So detectable by both.

So let's list each star's observed apparent V:

Star1: m=15.5 (observed) → can both detect.

Star2: m=16.5 → only ESPRESSO.

Star3: m=15.5 → can both detect.

Star4: m=16.74 → only ESPRESSO.

Star5: m=15.0 → can both detect.

Wait, wait. Wait, what about Star3's extinction? Oh, Star3's E(B-V) is 0.6, which adds extinction. So maybe the apparent V given in the problem is the observed m, which already includes the extinction. So for Star3, m is 15.5, which is the observed value. So for Star3, the observed m is 15.5, which is within the limits of both. So Star3 can be detected by both.

So which stars have m <16? Let's see.

Star1: 15.5 → yes.

Star2:16.5 → no.

Star3:15.5 → yes.

Star4:16.74 → no.

Star5:15.0 → yes.

Wait, so which options in the answer options have stars that are detectable by both.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Star4 and Star5 → Star4 can’t be detected by HIRES.

Option B: Star3 and Star5 → both can be detected.

Option C: Star2 and Star3 → Star2 can't be detected by HIRES.

Option D: Star1 and Star4 → Star4 can't be detected by HIRES.

So the correct answer would be stars that have m <16. So Star1, Star3, and Star5.

Wait, but the options don't have an option with three stars. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A) Star4 and Star5 → Star4's m=16.74 → can't be detected by HIRES. So only Star5 is detected by both, so option A is only Star5, but not Star4.

B) Star3 and Star5 → both meet the condition (their m is 15.5 and 15.0, respectively, which are both <16). So both are acceptable.

C) Star2 and Star3 → Star2's m=16.5, which is above HIRES limit.

D) Star1 and Star4 → Star4's m=16.74 is above HIRES.

So the correct answer is option B: Star3 and Star5.

Wait, but wait. Wait, let me double-check.

Star3's m is 15.5, which is under 16 → detectable by both.

Star5's m is 15.0, which is under 16 → detectable by both.

So options B (Star3 and Star5) is correct.

Wait, but let me think again: Star5's m is 15.0, which is okay. So which option includes both?

Option B says Star3 and Star5.

So the correct answer is option B, which is option B.

To determine which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at the Paranal Observatory and the HIRES spectrograph at the Keck Observatory, we analyze the apparent V magnitudes of the stars, considering the telescopes' brightness limits. ESPRESSO can observe stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag (i.e., $m < 17$), while HIRES can observe stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 16 mag (i.e., $m < 16$). Therefore, a star must have $m < 16$ to be detectable by both instruments.

### Analysis of Each Star:
1. **Star1**:  
   - Absolute magnitude $M = 15.5$, distance $d = 10 \, \text{pc}$.  
   - Apparent magnitude: $m = M + 5 \log_{10}(d/10) = 15.5 + 5 \log_{10}(1) = 15.5$.  
   - $m = 15.5 < 16$, so it is detectable by both ESPRESSO and HIRES.

2. **Star2**:  
   - Apparent magnitude $m = 16.5$.  
   - $m = 16.5 > 16$, so it is not detectable by HIRES, but it is detectable by ESPRESSO.

3. **Star3**:  
   - Apparent magnitude $m = 15.5$.  
   - $m = 15.5 < 16$, so it is detectable by both ESPRESSO and HIRES.

4. **Star4**:  
   - Absolute magnitude $M = 15.5$, distance $d = 10 \, \text{pc}$, $E(B-V) = 0.4$.  
   - Extinction: $A_V = 3.1 \times E(B-V) = 3.1 \times 0.4 = 1.24$.  
   - Apparent magnitude: $m = M + 5 \log_{10}(d/10) + A_V = 15.5 + 0 + 1.24 = 16.74$.  
   - $m = 16.74 > 16$, so it is not detectable by HIRES, but it is detectable by ESPRESSO.

5. **Star5**:  
   - Absolute magnitude $M = 16.5$, distance $d = 5 \, \text{pc}$.  
   - Apparent magnitude: $m = M + 5 \log_{10}(d/10) = 16.5 + 5 \log_{10}(0.5) = 16.5 - 1.505 = 15.0$.  
   - $m = 15.0 < 16$, so it is detectable by both ESPRESSO and HIRES.

### Conclusion:
- Stars detectable by both ESPRESSO and HIRES are **Star1, Star3, and Star5**.  
- Among the options provided, only **Star3 and Star5** satisfy the condition of being detectable by both instruments.

**Answer: B**
