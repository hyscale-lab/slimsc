Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused but let me try to think it through. The question is about electric fields around a spherical conductor with a cavity. Hmm, I remember something about conductors and charges from my notes. 

Alright, let's read the setup again. There's an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R. Inside it, there's a small spherical cavity. The center of the cavity is at a distance s from the center of the conductor, and the radius of the cavity is r, which is smaller than R. So the cavity is entirely inside the conductor, right? 

Now, a small positive charge +q is placed inside the cavity. The question is about finding the electric field at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor, and l is the distance from the center of the cavity to P. Also, the angle between l and s (the distance from conductor's center to cavity's center) is theta. Oh, and l and L are both greater than R, so P is definitely outside the conductor.

I've learned about Gauss's Law and how it applies to conductors. Since the conductor is uncharged, but there's a charge inside the cavity, I think the induced charges will come into play. When a charge is inside a conductor's cavity, the conductor responds by inducing charges on its inner and outer surfaces. 

Wait, the conductor was initially uncharged. So the charge +q in the cavity will induce a -q on the inner surface of the conductor. But since the conductor itself is neutral overall, the outer surface must have +q, right? Because the total charge on the conductor is zero, so inner surface is -q, so outer surface must be +q to balance it.

Now, the electric field outside a conductor depends only on the total enclosed charge. So outside the conductor, the field should be the same as if all the charge were concentrated at the center. That's the shell theorem idea. So for a point outside, the field is as if the charge is at the center.

Wait, but in this case, the conductor has a cavity, and the charge is off-center. How does that affect the field outside? Well, I remember that the electric field outside a conductor with a cavity depends only on the net charge on the conductor, not on the distribution inside. But wait, the conductor's net charge is zero, right? Because it was uncharged. Wait no, wait: the conductor is neutral, but the charge inside the cavity is +q. So the conductor's inner surface must have -q, and the outer surface must have +q. So the total charge on the conductor is (-q) + (+q) = 0. So the conductor remains neutral. Therefore, the outer surface's charge is +q, but wait, no, the conductor was initially neutral. So the induced charge is such that the inner surface has -q, and the outer surface has +q, making the conductor's total charge zero. Because the conductor was originally neutral. So the outer surface would have +q because the inner is -q. But wait, the conductor started as neutral, so if the cavity has +q, the inner surface must have -q (due to induction), and the outer surface must have +q to keep the total conductor's charge zero. So the conductor's total charge is -q (inner) + q (outer) = 0, which matches the initial condition.

Okay, so the point P is outside the conductor. So applying Gauss's Law, the electric field outside a conductor depends on the total enclosed charge within the Gaussian surface. The Gaussian surface here would enclose the entire conductor. The total charge inside would be the charge on the outer surface, which is +q. Wait, no, the conductor has a charge of zero in total, but the outer surface has +q? Wait, wait, no. Let's double-check.

The conductor was initially neutral. Then, when a charge +q is placed inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor must have -q (due to induction). Since the conductor is neutral overall, the outer surface must have +q to balance the inner surface's -q. So the total charge on the conductor is (-q) + (+q) = 0. So the conductor as a whole is neutral, but the outer surface has +q.

Wait, but the outer surface's charge is +q. So when considering a Gaussian surface outside the conductor (radius L > R), the enclosed charge is +q. So the electric field at P would be the same as if the charge +q were located at the center of the conductor. But wait, the point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor. So the field at P would be E = (1/(4πε₀)) * (q)/L². Because that's the field due to a point charge at the center.

Wait, but let me think again. Because the charge in the cavity is not at the center of the conductor. The cavity's center is s distance away from the conductor's center, and the charge is inside the cavity. Does that affect the outer field?

Ah, I think not. Because the charges on the outer surface of the conductor are free to move, and if the conductor is a perfect conductor, the charges would distribute themselves uniformly on the outer surface. Wait, but if the conductor is neutral overall, and the outer surface has +q, then the distribution depends on whether the conductor is isolated or not. But in this case, the conductor is a shell, so the outer surface's charge distributes uniformly. So regardless of where the charge inside the cavity is placed (like off-center), the induced charges on the outer surface would arrange in such a way that the external field is as if the charge were at the center.

Wait, but wait a second. If the charge is off-center inside the cavity, the inner surface's charge would be induced to cancel the field inside the conductor. So the inner surface would have a charge distribution that's not uniform. But the outer surface, being a conductor, would have its charges rearrange to maintain the external field as if the charge were at the center. Therefore, the external field would be same as if all the charge were at the center.

So the field at point P, which is outside the conductor, would be E = (1/(4πε₀)) * (q)/L². Because L is the distance from the center of the conductor to P.

Looking at the options, option B says E = (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L².

But wait, what about the other options? Let me check.

Option A: (l - s cosθ)^2 in denominator. Hmm, that seems more like the case when the field is calculated considering the displacement of the charge inside the cavity. But wait, no. Because for any point outside the conductor, the field is determined by the total charge of the conductor, regardless of where the charge is placed inside. Because the conductor's charges rearrange such that their external field is as if all charge is at the center.

Hmm, but wait, no. Wait, another thought: the field inside the conductor is zero, and the charges in the conductor rearrange so that the internal field is zero. So the conductor's inner surface would have an induced charge distribution that cancels the field inside the conductor due to the charge in the cavity.

But for the external field, the conductor's outer surface behaves as if it's a point charge at the center. So the field outside is same as if the charge were at the center, irrespective of where the charge is placed inside the cavity. So yes, the field at P is (1/(4πε₀)) q / L².

Wait, but why are the other options even there? Let's think again. For example, option D is E proportional to 1/l², where l is the distance from the center of the cavity. But that would be the case if the charge were outside the conductor, but in this case, the conductor's charges screen the internal arrangement. So no, the external field depends only on the conductor's total charge.

So the correct answer should be option B.

To determine the electric field $\vec{E}$ at a point $P$ outside the spherical conductor, we analyze the situation using Gauss's Law and the properties of conductors. The conductor is initially uncharged, but a small positive charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity. This induces a charge $-q$ on the inner surface of the conductor to cancel the electric field within the conductor. Since the conductor remains neutral overall, the outer surface must have a charge $+q$ to balance the $-q$ on the inner surface.

For a point $P$ outside the conductor, the electric field depends only on the total charge enclosed within a Gaussian surface that surrounds the conductor. The total charge enclosed is the charge on the outer surface, which is $+q$. The field at $P$ is therefore equivalent to the field produced by a point charge $+q$ located at the center of the conductor, regardless of the position of the charge inside the cavity. This is due to the fact that the charges on the outer surface of the conductor rearrange to ensure the external field behaves as if all the charge were concentrated at the center.

The distance from the center of the conductor to $P$ is $L$, so the electric field at $P$ is given by:

\[
E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}.
\]

Examining the options:
- **Option A** and **Option C** involve terms like $(l - s \cos\theta)^2$ or $(l + s \cos\theta)^2$, which are not relevant for the external field, as the field depends only on the total charge and not on the internal arrangement.
- **Option D** involves $1/l^2$, which would apply if the field were calculated relative to the center of the cavity, but this is incorrect for a point outside the conductor.
- **Option B** correctly gives the field as $E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}$, which matches the analysis.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: B**
