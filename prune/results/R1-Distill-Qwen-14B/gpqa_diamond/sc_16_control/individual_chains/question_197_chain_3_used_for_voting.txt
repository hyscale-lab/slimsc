Okay, so I need to figure out this organic chemistry problem. Let me take it step by step. The question is about identifying a product formed when Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm, red phosphorus and HI... Oh wait, I remember that reaction! That's the Hunsdiecker reaction, right? Or maybe it's related to the formation of an acid from an ester or something else. Wait, no, the Hunsdiecker reaction is about converting alkyl halides to carboxylic acids. But I might be mixing that up.

Looking back, the reagents are red phosphorus and HI. Another reaction I know is the Weitz-Scheffer reaction, which is when an alkyne is converted to an acid with these reagents. But wait, maybe that's not it. Alternatively, red phosphorus with HI could be part of the hydroboration reaction, but no, I think that uses different conditions. Oh wait, another possibility: when an ester reacts with red phosphorus and HI, it might form an acid. But wait, I think that's more like the hydrolysis of an ester, but under acidic conditions? Or maybe it's the cleavage of an ester.

Wait, no. I think the reaction of an ester with red phosphorus and HI is used to cleave the ester into an acid. Let me think: If the compound has an ester group, maybe like R-O-CO-R', then reacting with red phosphorus and HI would hydrolyze the ester, but wait, under what conditions? Alternatively, perhaps the ester is converted to the acid.

But let's first analyze the given data for Compound X. The IR and NMR data might help me figure out what X is, which in turn will help me determine the product.

Starting with the IR data: The peaks are in the ranges 3400–2500 cm-1, which is broad, likely O-H stretch. Wait, but wait: 3400 is usually N-H or O-H. But also, 1720 cm-1 is a strong peak which is indicative of a carbonyl group, maybe an ester or ketone or maybe a carboxylic acid. But if it's a carboxylic acid, the O-H stretch would be even broader and maybe around 2500-3300. Also, 1610 and 1450 cm-1 are in the range of aromatic rings (C=C stretching). So, the compound likely has an aromatic ring and a carbonyl group, perhaps an ester or maybe an acid.

Looking at the 1H NMR data:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): A broad singlet around 10.5 is probably an aldehyde proton. Wait, but wait, aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm. Alternatively, it could be a carboxylic acid proton. But if it's a carboxylic acid, the proton is usually a broad peak, but it might appear around 10-12 ppm. Wait, but 10.5 is a bit low for a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, maybe it's an aldehyde. But wait, in the NMR, the integration is 1H, so it's a single proton. If it's an aldehyde, that's possible. But if it's a carboxylic acid, that might fit.

Wait, but looking at the other peaks: 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H). That suggests a para-substituted aromatic ring. Because the two doublets each have 2H, which are typically two protons each on adjacent carbons in a para substitution. So that's a benzene ring with substituents that cause the splitting into two doublets—so probably a para-substituted group, like a methyl group and another substituent, perhaps an ester or something else.

Looking at the other NMR signals:

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): A multiplet of 1H. Maybe a CH group attached to something else, perhaps next to an electronegative group or part of a chain.

- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): Two protons, maybe a CH2 group in a chain, perhaps adjacent to a carbonyl.

- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): A triplet of 3H. A methyl group attached to a CH, perhaps as in an isopropyl group (like CH(CH2CH3) or something like that).

- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): A triplet integrating for 3H, suggesting a terminal methyl group, probably in an ethyl chain. So maybe like CH2CH3.

Putting this together: Let's imagine a benzene ring with a para substituent. The substituent is probably an ester group because of the 1720 cm-1 peak in IR, which is typical for esters (the carbonyl). So maybe the benzene ring has an ester group attached.

The substituent on the benzene is something like an ester, O-CO-O-R. Wait, but in an ester, the carbonyl is part of the ester group. Alternatively, if it's a ketone, the peak would be around 1720 cm-1 as well, but the NMR might show different shifts.

Wait, but the NMR shows a peak at 10.5 ppm, which could be an aldehyde. Alternatively, maybe an acid. Let me think about the possible structures.

Alternative approach: Let's try to draw the structure.

The aromatic ring is para-substituted with two groups. Wait, no, the NMR shows two doublets each integrating for 2H. That's characteristic of a para-substituted ring with two substituents on opposite positions, but actually, wait, no. Because in a para-substituted benzene with one substituent (let's say, X), the ring would have two sets of protons: the ortho and para to X. But if there's another substituent, maybe in the meta position, but the coupling could lead to different splitting. Wait, no, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, the NMR shows two doublets, each for 2H. So, in a benzene ring, if two substituents are present in such a way that the ring has two sets of equivalent protons. Wait, perhaps the substituents are in the para positions, but that would give four equivalent protons. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps there's a substituent that's a para-substituted group, with another substituent in a meta position.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is an ester group, like O-CO-OR. So if the substituent is an ester attached to the benzene ring. So, for example, the ring is at position 4, and the ester is at position 1. Then, the aromatic protons would be two doublets. Or maybe the substituent is an ester group like in a methyl benzoate structure, but substituted in such a way that the ring has two substituents, leading to the doublets.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps the substituent on the benzene is a side chain. Let me think about the other NMR signals. The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) is a multiplet. That could be a CH group adjacent to something, maybe an oxygen. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be a CH2 adjacent to a carbonyl group, and the 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is a methyl group attached to a CH. The 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) is a terminal methyl, so perhaps part of an ethyl group.

Putting this together, maybe the substituent is a chain like O-CO-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2CH3? No, wait, let's think about it.

Alternatively, the substituent is an ester group, perhaps something like O-CO-O-R, but R being a chain. Wait, but the NMR shows a 10.5 ppm peak, which might not fit with an ester.

Wait, another angle: the IR at 3400–2500 could be an O-H stretch, but that would be for an acid. But another possibility is that it's an aldehyde's O-H (but aldehydes don't have O-H; wait, that's a mistake. Aldehydes have a C-H in the aldehyde proton, which appears around 9-10 ppm. But O-H is different. So the 3400–2500 is a broad peak, so perhaps O-H, but if it's a carboxylic acid, that would make sense. The 1720 cm-1 would then be something else, like an ester or maybe a ketone.

Wait, but if it's a carboxylic acid, the carbonyl peak would be around 1700 cm-1, but 1720 is higher, which is more typical of an ester or maybe an aldehyde. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the compound is an ester. So, the IR at 1720 cm-1 is the ester carbonyl. The broad peak between 3400 and 2500 could be from an -OH group from another part, but wait, in an ester, -OCH2CH3 wouldn't have an OH. Unless it's a hemiacetal or something else. Alternatively, maybe the IR peak isn't from an OH. Let me think.

Wait, the IR has a peak at 3400–2500, which is a broad region. That could also be due to C-H stretching in alkenes or maybe an amine. But in this case, the NMR doesn't show any peaks that would suggest an amine. So perhaps it's an O-H from a carboxylic acid. So perhaps the compound is a benzoic acid with an ester group? No, that doesn't make much sense.

Wait, maybe it's an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester. The IR peak at 1610 cm-1 and 1450 cm-1 could be C=C stretching, so that would fit with an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester. So, perhaps the substituent is an ester with a double bond adjacent to it.

So, if the substituent is an ester group attached to the benzene ring, and then there's a double bond alpha to the ester. So, structure like Ph-CH2-CO-O-R or Ph-CH2-CO-O-R, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but let's look at the NMR. The 10.5 ppm is a broad singlet of 1H. If the substituent is an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester, perhaps the protons are on the double bond. Wait, but that would be around 5-6 ppm, not 10.5.

Alternatively, the 10.5 ppm is an aldehyde proton. So maybe the substituent is an aldehyde group. But then, the IR at 1720 would be a ketone or ester. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the substituent is a ketone. So the IR at 1720 cm-1 is a ketone. Then, the 10.5 ppm could be an aldehyde proton, but that would make the molecule have both a ketone and an aldehyde, which seems less likely. Alternatively, perhaps the 10.5 is a carboxylic acid. Wait, but then the 1720 would be an ester. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a carboxylic acid. So, the IR would have a peak around 1720, which would be a bit high for a carboxylic acid (they are usually around 1700 cm-1). But maybe it's a conjugated acid.

Wait, but the NMR shows a peak at 10.5 ppm, which is a broad singlet. That's very suggestive of a carboxylic acid proton. So, if the substituent is a carboxylic acid group, then the 1720 cm-1 could be from a carbonyl in another part.

Wait, but that doesn't fit. Let me think again.

Another approach: Let's consider the possible structure based on the NMR data.

The aromatic region: two doublets each integrating to 2H, so the benzene is para-substituted. So, the substituent is in the para position relative to another group. Wait, no, for a single substituent, the ring would have two sets of equivalent protons. But if there are two substituents, maybe in the para positions, it could create that splitting.

Wait, perhaps the benzene ring has an ester group and a methyl group in the para positions. So, 4-methyl benzoate. But then, the substituent would be O-CO-O-R attached to the benzene ring.

But looking at the other NMR signals, we have a CH2 group (1.7 ppm, 2H), a CH group (2.9 ppm, 1H), a methyl group (1.4 ppm, 3H, d), and a terminal methyl (0.9 ppm, 3H, t). So that suggests a chain attached to the ester.

So, perhaps the structure is something like phenyl ester attached to a chain. Let's imagine: benzene ring with an ester group O-CO-O-R attached, and R is a chain.

Wait, but the substituent on the benzene would be O-CO-O-R. Then the R is a chain. Let's see: R could be CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2CH3? Or something like that.

Wait, let's consider the chain. The NMR has a triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H) which is a terminal CH2CH3 group. So, that's like an ethyl group. Then, the 1.4 ppm (3H, d) is a methyl group attached to a CH. So perhaps it's a isopropyl group? Wait, isopropyl would have a CH(CH3)2, but that's two methyl groups. Alternatively, maybe it's a CH2CH(CH2CH3) group.

Wait, perhaps the structure is more like CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-something. Hmm, maybe the chain is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2- something. Let me try to put it together.

If the substituent is an ester group O-CO-O-R, and R is a chain like CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2CH3, but wait, the NMR doesn't directly show that. Alternatively, R could be a butyl group, but with branching.

Alternatively, perhaps the ester is O-CO-O-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2CH3? No, that might not fit.

Wait, maybe the structure is Ph-O-CO-O-R, but that's a carbonate, which I don't think is the case here. Alternatively, the substituent is O-CO-R, making it an ester.

Wait, the NMR data also includes a 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), which could be a CH group connected to another group. Let's say the ester is O-CO-O-R, and R is a chain of CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2CH3? No, that would have more protons.

Wait, perhaps the R group is CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-, but that seems off. Alternatively, maybe R is CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2CH3, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the chain is (CH2)2CH(CH3). So, that would be a pentyl group? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a sec-butyl group.

Wait, the 1.4 ppm d (3H) suggests a methyl group attached to a CH. So, maybe a CH(CH3) group. The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) could be the CH group. Then, the 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be a CH2 connected to the CH group. And the 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) is a terminal CH2CH3.

So, putting that together, the chain would be CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2CH3. Wait, but that would be a pentyl group. Or maybe it's a butyl group.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2CH2CH(CH3)CH2CH3? No, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps the chain is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2CH3. Wait, but that would give a longer chain.

Wait, maybe it's CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2CH3, but that's a 4-methylpentyl group. Alternatively, if it's a branch, maybe it's a isobutyl group.

Wait, but the NMR shows a d (doublet) for the 1.4 ppm (3H). That's a methyl group attached to a CH. So, the structure would look like CH(CH3)(something). For example, in isobutyl group: CH(CH2CH3)2. But then the NMR would show a different pattern.

Wait, perhaps the R group is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2CH3. But then, how does that connect? Maybe it's O-CO-O-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2CH3. But wait, let me count the hydrogens.

Alternatively, perhaps the R group is CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3. So, the chain would be CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3. Wait, that's a 3-methylbutyl group. So, the substituent would be O-CO-O-(CH2)2CH(CH3).

But wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to reconstruct the structure.

So, benzene ring with an ester group O-CO-O-R, and R is a chain. The chain is connected to the ester oxygen. The chain NMR signals suggest a CH group (2.9 ppm, 1H), a CH2 group (1.7 ppm, 2H), a methyl group (1.4 ppm, d, 3H), and a terminal CH2CH3 (0.9 ppm, t, 3H). So, the chain is something like CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2CH3.

Wait, but wait, that would be a four-carbon chain. So, the chain is CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2CH3. But that would be, wait, that's a pentyl group with a branch.

But perhaps it's a butyl group with a branch. Let's think: the chain is CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. That would be a 2-methylpropyl group, which is an isobutyl group. Wait, but that's three carbons attached to the oxygen. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the structure is O-CO-O-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2CH3. No, that's a longer chain. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is O-CO-O-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3, which would make the R group an iso... something. Wait, maybe it's a sec-butyl group.

Wait, a sec-butyl group is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-. But that's two carbons. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a propyl group with a methyl branch. So, the R group is CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3. But that would be a four-carbon chain.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2CH3, but that doesn't seem to fit.

Wait, perhaps it's better to draw it out in my mind. The chain has a CH at 2.9 ppm (1H, multiplet), which is connected to a CH2 at 1.7 ppm (2H, multiplet) and a CH3 at 1.4 ppm (d, 3H). The CH3 is attached to the CH, which is connected to a CH2, which is connected to another CH2CH3.

So, the structure would be: CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2CH3. Wait, but that's five carbons. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the R group is CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3. That's four carbons in total. So the substituent would be O-CO-O-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3.

Wait, but that would make the ester group O-CO-O-(CH2)2CH(CH3)CH2CH3, but that doesn't seem to fit the NMR.

Alternatively, maybe the chain is shorter. Let me think: the CH at 2.9 ppm is connected to a CH2 at 1.7, which is connected to a CH3 at 1.4, and a CH2CH3 at 0.9. So, perhaps the chain is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2CH3. But then the CH(CH2CH3) is attached to the CH2, which is attached to the ester.

Wait, perhaps the structure is O-CO-O-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2CH3. That would make the substituent a pentyl group with a branch.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is an ethyl group with branching. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should think about the overall structure again.

Putting it all together, the benzene ring has a substituent which is an ester group (from the IR carbonyl at 1720). The substituent is connected to a chain that includes a CH group (2.9 ppm), a CH2 (1.7 ppm), a CH3 (1.4 ppm), and a CH2CH3 (0.9 ppm). So, perhaps the substituent is O-CO-O-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3.

Wait, but that's a four-carbon chain. So the substituent would be O-CO-O-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3. That would be an ester with a pentyl group, but with a branch.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is O-CO-O-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2CH3. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps it's O-CO-O-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2CH3, which would be an ester with a butyl group.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is O-CO-O-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3, which would give the following NMR signals:

The CH2 group next to the ester (O-CO-O-) would be at 4.2 or something, but the given NMR doesn't show that. So maybe that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is O-CO-O-R, and R is a butyl group with a branch, like isobutyl.

Wait, isobutyl is CH2CH(CH3)2. So, if R is isobutyl, then the ester would be O-CO-O-CH2CH(CH3)2.

But what would the NMR look like for that? The isobutyl group has a CH2 attached to the oxygen, then a CH connected to two methyl groups. So, in the NMR, the CH2 attached to the oxygen would be a triplet around 4 ppm. But in the given data, the 2.9 ppm is a multiplet, not a triplet. Hmm. So perhaps that's not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps R is a pentyl group with a branch. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is O-CO-O-CH2CH(CH2CH3)CH2CH3. But that's getting too complicated. Maybe I should try to think of the possible product after the reaction.

The reaction is with red phosphorus and HI. If the starting material is an ester, reacting with red phosphorus and HI typically leads to the formation of a carboxylic acid. For example, in the hydrolysis of esters, but under acidic conditions, perhaps with red phosphorus as a catalyst or something.

Wait, another thought: maybe Compound X is a ketone, but I don't think so because of the NMR and IR data suggesting an ester and aromatic rings.

Wait, back to the reaction. Red phosphorus and HI: I think it's used in the Baeyer-Villiger reaction, but I don't think so. Alternatively, perhaps it's used to form an acid from an alkyne via the Weitz-Scheffer reaction. But that would require an alkyne, which I don't see evidence for in the NMR.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the hydrolysis of an ester to a carboxylic acid. So, if X is an ester, the product would be a carboxylic acid.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid.

Option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

So, if X is an ester, the product would be the corresponding acid.

But let me think about the structure of X. The NMR and IR data suggest that X is an ester of a benzoic acid with a branched alkyl group.

So, perhaps X is 4-(sec-butyl) benzoate ester. Because the sec-butyl group would explain the NMR signals.

Wait, the sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH2CH3)CH2-. No, wait, the sec-butyl is CH(CH2CH3)CH2-. Wait, no: the structure of sec-butyl is CH2CH(CH3)CH2-.

Wait, no: the structure of sec-butyl is CH2-CH(CH3)-. Wait, no, that's isobutyl. Let me get this right.

Butyl groups:

- n-butyl: CH2CH2CH2CH2-

- iso-butyl (or 2-butyl): CH2CH(CH2CH3)-

Wait, no. Wait, the correct structures are:

- n-butyl: CH2CH2CH2CH2-

- iso-butyl: CH(CH2CH3)CH2-

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me correct: iso-butyl is (CH3)2CHCH2-, so it's CH2CH(CH3)2 as the substituent.

Wait, no. The iso-butyl group is CH2-CH(CH3)2. So, the structure is CH2-CH(CH3)2. Therefore, the substituent is O-CO-O-CH2-CH(CH3)2.

But wait, if the substituent is O-CO-O-CH2-CH(CH3)2, then the R group is iso-butyl.

So, X would be 4-(iso-butyl) benzoate.

Then, when X reacts with red phosphorus and HI, which is a strong acid and a source of iodide, the ester would hydrolyze to the benzoic acid.

So, the product would be 4-(iso-butyl) benzoic acid. Which is option C.

Wait, let me check the options again.

Option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

Hmm. Wait, is the substituent iso-butyl or sec-butyl?

Wait, the substituent is O-CO-O-R, where R is iso-butyl (CH2-CH(CH3)2). So, the substituent on the benzene is iso-butyl, but the options refer to sec-butyl.

Wait, the substituent attached to the benzene is a sec-butyl group?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the structure. Let me re-examine the NMR.

The NMR has a 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), which is a methyl group attached to a CH. So, the structure could be R-O-CO-O-benzene, where R is a chain that includes a CH(CH3) group.

Wait, if the R group is CH2CH(CH3)CH2CH3, that would be a pentyl group with a branch. But that doesn't seem to fit.

Alternatively, perhaps R is CH(CH2CH2CH3)CH2CH3. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, another approach: The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) is probably a CH connected to an electronegative atom, like oxygen. So, in the ester group, R-O-CO-O-benzene. The R is a chain where the CH at 2.9 ppm is adjacent to a carbonyl group.

So, the chain would be like R-O-CO-O-benzene, where R is CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2CH3. But wait, that seems complicated.

Wait, perhaps the R group is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2CH3. But then, the NMR would have a triplet around 1.7 ppm for the CH2 next to the CH. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the R group is CH(CH2CH2CH3)CH2CH3. No, that's a longer chain.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a propyl group with a methyl branch. So, R is CH(CH3)CH2CH3, which is iso-butyl. So, R is iso-butyl.

Then, the structure would be O-CO-O-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3. Wait, but that would make the R group iso-butyl, which is (CH3)2CH-.

Wait, but in that case, the NMR would have a triplet for the CH2 connected to the oxygen. But in the given data, the 2.9 ppm is a multiplet, not a triplet.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to think about the possible options again.

The options are:

A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid

B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene

C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid

D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene

So, if X is an ester, the product would be a carboxylic acid. So, options A and C are acids.

Option A is a propanoic acid with a 4-ethylphenyl group. Option C is a benzoic acid with a 4-(sec-butyl) group.

In the NMR of X, the aromatic protons are at 8.0 (d, 2H) and 7.2 (d, 2H). So, the substituent on the benzene is in the para position, leading to two doublets.

If X is the ester, 4-(sec-butyl) benzoate, then the product after hydrolysis would be 4-(sec-butyl) benzoic acid, which is option C.

So, the substituent is a sec-butyl group on the benzene ring, attached to the ester. Then, after hydrolysis, it becomes a benzoic acid with the same substituent.

So, the answer would be option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves identifying the final product when Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. The analysis begins by interpreting the IR and NMR data of Compound X to deduce its structure.

### IR Analysis:
- **3400–2500 cm⁻¹**: A broad peak, likely due to an O-H stretch, suggesting the presence of a carboxylic acid or an alcohol.
- **1720 cm⁻¹**: A strong peak indicative of a carbonyl group, likely from an ester or a carboxylic acid.
- **1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹**: Peaks consistent with aromatic C=C stretching, indicating the presence of a benzene ring.

### NMR Analysis:
- **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H)**: A broad singlet, characteristic of a carboxylic acid proton.
- **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H)**: Two doublets integrating to 2H each, consistent with a para-substituted aromatic ring.
- **2.9 ppm (m, 1H)**: A multiplet for a CH group, likely adjacent to an electronegative atom.
- **1.7 ppm (m, 2H)**: A multiplet for a CH₂ group, possibly adjacent to a carbonyl group.
- **1.4 ppm (d, 3H)**: A doublet for a methyl group attached to a CH.
- **0.9 ppm (t, 3H)**: A triplet for a terminal methyl group, likely part of an ethyl chain.

### Structural Interpretation:
The IR and NMR data suggest that Compound X is an ester with a para-substituted benzene ring and a branched alkyl chain. The ester group explains the 1720 cm⁻¹ IR peak and the absence of an O-H stretch in the ester region. The para-substitution on the benzene ring accounts for the two doublets in the aromatic region of the NMR. The alkyl chain includes a CH group (2.9 ppm), a CH₂ group (1.7 ppm), a methyl group (1.4 ppm, d), and a terminal CH₂CH₃ group (0.9 ppm, t), consistent with a sec-butyl group.

### Reaction with Red Phosphorus and HI:
The reaction of an ester with red phosphorus and HI typically results in the hydrolysis of the ester to form a carboxylic acid. Therefore, if Compound X is 4-(sec-butyl) benzoate, the product of the reaction would be 4-(sec-butyl) benzoic acid.

### Evaluation of Options:
- **A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid**: This does not match the NMR data, as it would not produce the observed splitting pattern for the aromatic protons or the alkyl chain signals.
- **B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene**: This is incorrect because the reaction conditions do not support the formation of an alkylated benzene.
- **C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**: This matches the data. The para-substitution on the benzene ring and the sec-butyl group are consistent with the NMR signals, and the reaction conditions favor the formation of a carboxylic acid.
- **D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**: This is incorrect because the reaction conditions do not support the formation of an alkylated benzene.

### Conclusion:
The final product is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.

Answer: C
