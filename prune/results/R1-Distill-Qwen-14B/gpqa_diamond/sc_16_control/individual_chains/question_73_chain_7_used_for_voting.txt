Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. 

Alright, first, what do I remember about relative speed in relativity? Oh right, you can't just add the speeds normally because of the speed limit, c. The formula for relative speed in special relativity is different. Wait, right, the formula is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)). But wait, wait—no, wait, because when both are moving in the same direction, it's (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1 v2)/(c^2)).

Wait, no, wait. Actually, when two objects are moving in the same direction, the relative speed as observed from one frame is not just simply subtracted. So if astronaut A is moving at 0.6c and astronaut B at 0.5c in the same direction, then from A's frame, B's speed is (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/(c²)). Wait, no, wait, because the formula is (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/c²), where u is the speed of the other object in the initial frame and v is the speed of the observer.

Wait, let me get this straight. The problem says both are moving in the positive x-direction. So, from the perspective of the first astronaut (mass 2m) moving at 0.6c, the second astronaut (mass 3m) moves at what speed? Let's call u as the speed of the second astronaut in the initial frame (0.5c), and v is the observer's speed (0.6c). So the relative speed would be (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/c²). So substituting the values, u=0.5c, v=0.6c.

So plugging in, (0.5c - 0.6c) is (-0.1c). Then the denominator is 1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/(c²) = 1 - (0.3 c²)/(c²) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So the relative speed is (-0.1c) / 0.7, which is approximately -0.1429c. But since relative speed is a positive value, the magnitude is 0.1429c, which is roughly 0.14c. So the relative speed is 0.14c. 

Hmm, okay, so the relative speed between them is about 0.14c. Looking at the options, options C and D have v_rel as 0.14c. So that's good, we can narrow it down to C or D.

Now, the second part is the total energy of the system. The system's energy would be the sum of the relativistic energies of both astronauts. Each astronaut has their own energy, which is gamma * m c². But wait, the problem gives their masses as 2m and 3m. So I need to calculate the energy for each.

First, calculate gamma for each. Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)).

For the first astronaut (2m), v is 0.6c. So v²/c² = (0.6)^2 = 0.36. So 1 - 0.36 = 0.64. sqrt(0.64) is 0.8. So gamma is 1/0.8 = 1.25. So energy E1 = gamma * m_rest * c². Since m_rest is 2m, E1 = 1.25 * 2m * c² = 2.5 m c².

For the second astronaut (3m), v is 0.5c. So v²/c² = 0.25. 1 - 0.25 is 0.75. sqrt(0.75) is approximately 0.8660. So gamma is 1 / 0.8660 ≈ 1.1547. So E2 = gamma * 3m c² = 1.1547 * 3 ≈ 3.464 m c².

Adding E1 and E2: 2.5 + 3.464 = 5.964 m c². So approximately 5.96 m c².

Looking at the options, option C says E is 5.96 mc², and option D says E is 5 mc². So option C is the one that matches the energy.

So putting it together, the relative speed is 0.14c and energy is 5.96 mc². So the correct option is C.

To solve the problem, we first calculate the relative speed of the two astronauts using the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \(v_1 = 0.6c\) and \(v_2 = 0.5c\). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.5c - 0.6c}{1 - \frac{(0.5c)(0.6c)}{c^2}} = \frac{-0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{-0.1c}{0.7} \approx -0.1429c
\]

The negative sign indicates the relative motion direction, but the magnitude of the relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\).

Next, we calculate the total energy of the system. The total energy is the sum of the relativistic energies of both astronauts. The relativistic energy of an object is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

For the first astronaut (mass \(2m\), speed \(0.6c\)):

\[
\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.6c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25
\]

\[
E_1 = \gamma_1 (2m) c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m \cdot c^2 = 2.5m c^2
\]

For the second astronaut (mass \(3m\), speed \(0.5c\)):

\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.5c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]

\[
E_2 = \gamma_2 (3m) c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m \cdot c^2 \approx 3.464m c^2
\]

The total energy of the system is:

\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5m c^2 + 3.464m c^2 \approx 5.96m c^2
\]

From the options, the relative speed is \(0.14c\) and the total energy is \(5.96m c^2\). Therefore, the correct answer is:
