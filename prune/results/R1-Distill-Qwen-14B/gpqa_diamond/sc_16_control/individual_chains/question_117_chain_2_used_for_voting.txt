Okay, so I have this question about optical isomerism in organic compounds. Hmm, let me think. I remember that optical isomerism occurs when a compound has chiral centers, meaning they can't be superimposed on their mirror images. So, the compound must not have a plane of symmetry and must have at least one carbon with four different substituents.

The question lists four compounds and asks which show optical isomerism. The options are combinations of these four. Let's go through each one by one.

1. **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**
   - Biphenyl rings connected at the 1,1' positions. The substituents are at 2,2' and 6,6'. Wait, the structure has two methyl esters at 2 and 2', and nitro groups at 6 and 6'. So, does this molecule have a chiral center? I'm not sure. Biphenyls can sometimes have axial chirality if the substituents are arranged in a way that causes the rings to twist. Since the substituents are on opposite positions (2 and 6), maybe the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry. Oh wait, but if the substituents are symmetric, maybe it's not chiral. Hmm. Wait, the nitro groups are on both 6,6' positions, and the esters on 2,2'. So, the molecule might have a plane of symmetry through the central bond. If that's the case, there's no chirality. But wait, if the substituents on each ring are in positions that prevent a plane of symmetry, maybe it's chiral. I'm a bit confused here. Alternatively, maybe the biphenyl part itself can't be chiral because of the way the rings are arranged. Maybe this compound doesn't exhibit optical isomerism. I'll have to come back to this.

2. **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**
   - The structure is CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3. Wait, wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate would be the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. Let me draw this: the carbon chain is CH2CH(OH)COOCH3? Or wait, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH, but when it's 2-hydroxy, it's CH3CH(OH)COOCH3? No, wait, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would be CH2(OH)CH2COOH. Wait, no, actually propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. So 2-hydroxy would be on the second carbon. So it's CH3-CHOH-COOH, but as an ester, it's methyl ester. So CH3-C(OH)H-CO-OCH3? Wait, the structure would be: the central carbon (carbon 2) has OH, CH3, COOCH3, and another H? So that's four different groups: OH, CH3, COOCH3, and H. That makes it a chiral center. So yes, this compound has optical isomerism. So option 2 does exhibit it.

3. **benzophenone**
   - Structure is (Phenyl)2CO. So, two phenyl groups attached to a ketone. The ketone is C=O. The central carbon is connected to two phenyl groups and the carbonyl. Wait, the carbonyl is double-bonded, so the central carbon is C with two phenyls, a carbonyl, and a hydrogen? No, benzophenone is (Ph)2CO. So the carbonyl is C=O, and the carbon is connected to two phenyl groups and the oxygen. Wait, no, the structure is Ar-C(=O)-Ar, where Ar is aryl (like phenyl). So the central carbon is connected to two phenyl groups, a carbonyl oxygen, and another group? Wait, no, benzophenone is (Ph)2CO, meaning each benzene is attached to a carbonyl group. The central carbon is bonded to two phenyls and the carbonyl oxygen, but wait, I think the structure is (Ph)₂C=O. So the central carbon is double-bonded to O, and attached to two phenyl groups. So, for the central carbon, the substituents are two phenyl groups, an O (double bond), and another substituent? Wait, no, wait, the structure is (Ph)₂CO, so the carbonyl group is connected to the central carbon, which has two phenyl groups. Wait, perhaps I should think of it as:

       O
       ||
C(Ph)₂

So the central carbon is bonded to two phenyl groups and a double-bonded O. Does this carbon have four different groups? Let's see: two phenyls (same), O (as double bond), and a hydrogen? Wait, no. Because in benzophenone, the structure is (Ph)₂C=O. So the central carbon is connected to two Ph groups and a carbonyl group. So it's a carbonyl, which is a double bond, so the central carbon only has two substituents besides the carbonyl. Wait, no, the carbonyl is in the middle. So the structure is Ar-C(=O)-Ar. So the central carbon is double-bonded to O and has two Ar groups. Wait, but that's only three substituents. Wait, no, the central carbon is part of the carbonyl group. Or perhaps the structure is (Ph)(Ph)C=O, so the central carbon (the one in the carbonyl) is attached to two phenyl groups and double-bonded to O. But double bonds don't count as substituents in the same way. So the central carbon can't have four substituents because it's double-bonded. So the compound can't have a chiral center. Therefore, benzophenone doesn't show optical isomerism. So option 3 doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

4. **dimethyl fumarate**
   - Fumarate is the cis or trans isomer of di-carboxylic acid. Wait, no, fumarate is the trans isomer. Because maleic acid is the cis, and fumaric acid is the trans. Wait, dimethyl fumarate is the ester of fumaric acid. Structure: CH₂=CH(COOCH3)₂? Wait, no. Fumarate is trans, so the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. So the structure is CH₂(COOCH3)–CH₂, but with a double bond in between. Wait, more accurately, it's CH₂(COOCH3)–CH₂, but that doesn't make sense. Wait, fumaric acid is (E)-butenedioic acid. So its structure is CH₂CH(COOH)CH₂COOH, but in the trans configuration. As dimethyl ester, it's CH₂CH(COOCH3)CH₂COOCH3, but trans across the double bond. So, the molecule has a double bond between carbons 2 and 3. The substituents on each carbon of the double bond are two methyl esters and two CH3 groups? Wait, no, wait, let me get it right. Fumarate is (E)-butenedioate. So the structure is CH₂(COOCH3)–CH₂(COOCH3), but with a double bond between the two CH₂ groups. No, wait, but wait. The structure of fumarate is HO₂C-CH₂-CH₂-COOH, but in trans configuration. Wait, no, fumarate is (E)-HO₂CCH=CHCO₂H. So when it's the dimethyl ester, it's (E)-CH₂(COOCH3)–CH₂(COOCH3) with the double bond? Wait, no, that can't be right. Wait, the correct structure for dimethyl fumarate is CH₂(COOCH3)–CH₂(COOCH3) with a double bond between the two CH₂ groups. So it's CH₂=CH(COOCH3)₂? No, wait, no. Wait, fumarate is (E)-butenedioate. So the structure is CH₂=C(COOCH3)–CH₂COOCH3? No, wait, but wait, the actual structure is CH₂=CH(COOCH3)₂? No, that can't be because that would imply four substituents on the double bond. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, think of it as the ester of fumaric acid where each -COOH is replaced by -COOCH3. So fumaric acid is (E)-HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. So the ester would be (E)-CH₂(COOCH3)-CH=CH(COOCH3). No, wait, wait. Wait, fumaric acid is (E)-HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH, but no, no, wait. No, wait, HOOC-CH=CH-COOH is the structure, but in trans configuration. So the ester would have two methyl groups attached as esters on each end. So the structure is CH₂=C(COOCH3)₂. So each end of the double bond has a CH₂ group, which is connected to a COOCH3. So each carbon in the double bond has two substituents: one COOCH3 and a CH2? Wait, maybe each carbon is attached to a COOCH3 and another CH2 group. So each carbon in the double bond is connected to two COOCH3 groups? No, wait. Let me correct this. The correct structure for dimethyl fumarate is (E)-CH₂(COOCH3)-CH₂(COOCH3), but wait, with a double bond. So it's CH₂=CH(COOCH3)₂? No, that can't be. Because each of the double-bonded carbons would have two COOCH3 groups, so four substituents total. But wait, each carbon can only have four bonds. So the structure is CH₂(COOCH3)-CH₂(COOCH3), but with a double bond between the two CH₂ groups. So each CH₂ is connected to COOCH3, and the two CH₂ are connected by a double bond. So each of the two central carbons has a COOCH3, a CH₂ (from the other side), and two bonds in the double bond.

Wait, perhaps I should think of it as:
O
||
COOCH3
|
CH2-CH2-COOCH3
But that's not right. Alternatively, maybe it's:
COOCH3
|
CH2-CH2
|
COOCH3
But that's a single bond. Oh wait, no, the double bond is between the two CH2 groups. So it's CH₂=CH with each CH2 connected to a COOCH3.

Wait, perhaps it's better to imagine it as CH₂(COOCH3)-CH₂(COOCH3) with a double bond between the two CH₂. So each CH₂ is bonded to two COOCH3 groups and has a double bond. No, that can't be right because each carbon in the double bond would only have three bonds if the other bonds are to COOCH3. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps each carbon in the double bond has one COOCH3 and one CH₂ group connected to another COOCH3.

Wait, maybe the correct structure is CH₂=C(COOCH3)₂. So each carbon in the double bond is bonded to two COOCH3 groups. So each of those carbons has two COOCH3, a double bond, and two CH₂ groups? No, that doesn't make sense because each carbon can only have four bonds. So perhaps each has a double bond, one COOCH3, and two CH₂ groups attached to other parts. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.

But the key point is whether dimethyl fumarate has any stereoisomerism. Since fumarate is the trans isomer of maleate, which is cis. So dimethyl fumarate has a double bond with substituents on both carbons. Wait, if the substituents on each carbon of the double bond are the same, then the molecule might not have any geometric isomerism. Wait, but wait, in dimethyl fumarate, each carbon of the double bond is attached to two COOCH3 groups. Hmm, so each carbon has the same groups on either side. So maybe there's no possibility for geometric isomerism because both substituents on each carbon are the same.

Wait, no, I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. Fumarate is the trans isomer of maleic acid. So in the ester form, dimethyl fumarate would have the two substituents (the COOCH3 groups) on opposite sides of the double bond. So in the structure, the two COOCH3 groups would be on opposite sides. So this would lead to the possibility of the molecule having a plane of symmetry, perhaps? Or maybe it's a meso compound. Wait, wait, what's the structure again. Alternatively, maybe the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Alternatively, perhaps dimethyl fumarate is a geometric isomer but not a stereoisomer in terms of optical activity. Wait, no, geometric isomerism is a type of stereoisomerism. So if the molecule has geometric isomerism, that's a form of stereoisomerism, but geometric isomerism (cis/trans) isn't the same as optical isomerism (which is about chiral centers). So for optical isomerism, the molecule must have a chiral center. So dimethyl fumarate: do any of the carbons have four different groups?

In dimethyl fumarate, I think each carbon in the double bond has two COOCH3 groups. So each has two identical groups. So the carbons in the double bond can't be chiral centers. So maybe the molecule doesn't have any chiral centers. Wait, but maybe there's another carbon elsewhere with a chiral center. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is symmetrical, making it achiral. So dimethyl fumarate might not exhibit optical isomerism. Wait, but wait, fumarate is an E diacid. Its methyl ester would have the two ester groups on opposite sides of the double bond. So the molecule is (E), which is a geometric isomer, not a chiral center. So it's a type of stereoisomer but not optical isomerism. So perhaps dimethyl fumarate doesn't exhibit optical activity. Therefore, option 4 doesn't show optical isomerism.

Wait, wait, another thought: maybe the molecule has a plane of symmetry. For example, if the substituents on each double bond are mirror images, the molecule would be achiral. So dimethyl fumarate has two COOCH3 groups on opposite sides of the double bond, but if the molecule has a center of symmetry, it would not be chiral. So if the two substituents on each end are the same and arranged symmetrically, then the molecule is achiral. So perhaps dimethyl fumarate doesn't have optical isomerism.

So now, going back to each compound:

1. Does it have optical isomerism?
   - Earlier, I was confused. The substituents are at 2,2' and 6,6' positions on biphenyl. So each benzene ring has a methyl ester at position 2 and a nitro group at position 6. The biphenyl is connected at position 1 and 1'. So, the molecule would look like two benzene rings connected at their 1 positions, each with a methyl ester at 2 and a nitro group at 6. So if the substituents are arranged in such a way that the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it would be achiral. Wait, for each ring, the substituents are at positions 2 and 6, which are adjacent to each other. Oh wait, in a benzene ring, positions 2 and 6 are meta to each other. Wait, no, in a benzene ring, if you have substituents at positions 2 and 6, they are across from each other (since it's a six-membered ring). So for each ring, the substituents are at 2 and 6. So each ring has a methyl ester at 2 and a nitro group at 6, and the biphenyl connection is at 1 and 1'. So the molecule would have two rings connected at 1 and 1', each with substituents at 2 and 6. So, if the substituents are in such a way that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, it could be chiral. But perhaps the molecule is symmetric. For example, if the substituents on each ring are arranged in a mirror image fashion across the central bond, the molecule would be achiral. Alternatively, maybe the substituents are in positions that create chirality.

Wait, considering that each ring has substituents at 2 and 6, which are opposite each other, and the two rings are connected at 1 and 1', perhaps the arrangement leads to the molecule being symmetrical. So, the substituents are arranged such that the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. So compound 1 doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

But wait, another possibility: if the substituents are on the same side (cis) or opposite sides (trans) of the biphenyl, it could lead to axial chirality. If the substituents on each ring are arranged in a way that the molecule can't be superimposed on its mirror image, then it would exhibit optical isomerism. For example, if the groups on each ring are arranged in a way that creates a chiral axis, then the molecule is chiral. So, in this case, since each ring has two substituents, perhaps the molecule can exist in enantiomeric forms. So, perhaps compound 1 does exhibit optical isomerism. Hmm, this is confusing. I'm not entirely sure about this one. I'll have to think more.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the possibility of the molecule being a meso compound. If the substituents are arranged in such a way that the molecule has an internal plane of symmetry, then it would be achiral despite having stereogenic elements. So, for example, if each ring has substituents that mirror each other across the central bond, the molecule would be achiral. So, in that case, compound 1 would not show optical isomerism.

Alternatively, if the substituents are arranged asymmetrically on each ring, making the entire molecule not symmetrical, then it would be chiral and exhibit optical isomerism.

But I'm not certain about this. Let me move on and come back.

So, to recap:

- Compound 1: uncertain; could be chiral or not.
- Compound 2: has a chiral center (2-hydroxypropanoate), so yes.
- Compound 3: no chiral center, so no.
- Compound 4: no chiral center, so no.

Wait, but wait. Did I make a mistake about compound 4? Because dimethyl fumarate is an E diester. It has a double bond, but the question is about optical isomerism, which is about chirality, not E/Z isomerism. So, if the molecule doesn't have any chiral centers, then it won't exhibit optical isomerism.

So, for compound 4, no optical isomerism.

So, looking back at the options, the compounds that show optical isomerism are 2 and maybe 1.

Wait, but earlier I was unsure about compound 1. If compound 1 does exhibit optical isomerism, then the answer would include 1 and 2. Let me think again about compound 1.

Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

The structure: two benzene rings connected at position 1 and 1'. Each ring has a methyl ester at position 2 and a nitro group at position 6.

Wait, perhaps the substituents on each ring are at positions 2 and 6. So, for each ring, the substituents are at positions 2 and 6, which are across from each other. Let me imagine the structure. The first ring has methyl ester at 2 and nitro at 6, and the second ring has the same substituents. The rings are connected at 1 and 1'.

If the substituents on each ring are in such a way that the molecule can't be superimposed on its mirror image, then it's chiral. Otherwise, it's not.

Alternatively, if the substituents on each ring are arranged in a symmetrical manner, such as the methyl and nitro groups on each ring are mirror images across the central bond, then the molecule would be achiral.

Wait, considering the positions, 2 and 6 are opposite each other on a benzene ring. So, if both rings have substituents at 2 and 6, and the rings are connected at 1 and 1', then each ring has its substituents arranged symmetrically across the central bond.

Wait, when you have two substituents on each benzene ring at positions 2 and 6, and the rings are connected at 1 and 1', perhaps the substituents are arranged in such a way that the molecule has a plane of symmetry. So, it's symmetrical along the central bond, making the molecule achiral. Therefore, compound 1 doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

So, to summarize:

- Compound 1: No optical isomerism.
- Compound 2: Yes.
- Compound 3: No.
- Compound 4: No.

Wait, but wait. The question is about which of the four compounds show optical isomerism. So, only compound 2 does. But looking back at the options, which include combinations.

The options are:

A) 1,2 and4

B)3 and4

C)2 and3

D)1 and2

So, according to my analysis, only compound 2 exhibits optical isomerism. Looking at the options, none of the options have only 2. Wait, that can't be right. Let me check again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake about compound 4. Let me re-examine it.

Compound 4: dimethyl fumarate. Structure: (E)-CH₂(COOCH3)-CH₂(COOCH3). Wait, no, the correct structure is (E)-CH₂=CH(COOCH3)₂? Or perhaps it's (E)-CH₂(COOCH3)-CH₂(COOCH3) with a double bond. No, I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again.

The correct structure of fumaric acid is (E)-HOOC-CH₂CH₂-COOH? No, no, wait. No, fumaric acid is (E)-HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. So, when each -COOH is esterified with methyl, it becomes (E)-CH₂(COOCH3)-CH=CH(COOCH3)? Wait, no, that doesn't sound right.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct structure is (E)-CH₂=CH(COOCH3)₂. So each of the double-bonded carbons has a COOCH3 group attached. So, each of the double bond carbons has a COOCH3 and a CH2 group. Wait, but that can't be because each carbon in the double bond would have three substituents: COOCH3, CH2 (from each end), and the double bond. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong, but the key point is whether there are any chiral centers.

Wait, maybe the molecule has a central carbon with four different groups. Wait, in dimethyl fumarate, the structure is (E)-CH₂=CH(COOCH3)₂. So each of the carbons in the double bond is connected to two COOCH3 groups. So each carbon has two identical groups, so they can't be chiral centers. Therefore, there are no chiral centers in this molecule, so no optical isomerism. So compound 4 doesn't show optical isomerism.

So, the only compound that exhibits optical isomerism is 2. But looking at the options, option D is 1 and 2, option A is 1,2,4. Wait, but if only 2 is correct, then the correct answer would be 2, but the options don't have an option with only 2. Wait, did I make a mistake?

Wait, perhaps I missed another compound that exhibits optical isomerism.

Let me think again about compound 4: dimethyl fumarate. Wait, perhaps the molecule has a chiral center elsewhere. For example, if the ester groups are arranged in a way that creates a chiral center. But in dimethyl fumarate, each ester group is on a double bond, and the carbons in the double bond are each bonded to two COOCH3 groups, so no chiral centers.

Wait, another angle: maybe the molecule has a plane of symmetry. If the substituents are arranged symmetrically, then the molecule is not chiral. In dimethyl fumarate, the substituents on each end are the same, so it's symmetric. Therefore, no optical isomerism.

So, back to the four compounds:

Only compound 2 exhibits optical isomerism.

But looking at the options, none of the options have only 2. The options are:

A) 1,2 and4 → 3 compounds.

B)3 and4 → 2.

C)2 and3 → 2.

D)1 and2 → 2.

Wait, perhaps I was wrong about compound 1.

If compound 1 doesn't have a plane of symmetry, perhaps it's chiral. Let me think again about its structure. The biphenyl has substituents at 2 and 6 on each ring. The biphenyl is connected at 1 and 1'.

In such a structure, if the substituents are arranged in a way that the molecule isn't symmetrical, it could be chiral. For example, if the substituents on each ring are not mirror images, then the molecule would lack a plane of symmetry.

Wait, considering that each ring has a methyl ester at 2 and a nitro group at 6. If the substituents on each ring are arranged such that their positions relative to the connecting bond create a chiral arrangement, then the molecule could be chiral.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has axial chirality. Axial chirality occurs when there's a restricted rotation around a single bond, causing the two substituents on either side to be non-superimposable. For example, in biphenyl compounds, if the substituents on each ring are in a certain position, the molecule can have axial chirality.

In this case, the substituents are at 2 and 6 on each ring. The biphenyl is connected at 1 and 1'. So, the substituents at 2 and 6 are at meta positions relative to the connecting bond.

If the two rings have substituents arranged such that they cannot be mirrored, the molecule would be chiral. So, perhaps the substituents on each ring are on the same side relative to the connecting bond, leading to no symmetry and thus axial chirality.

Wait, but the substituents are on each ring's 2 and 6 positions, which are across from each other. So, if the substituents on each ring are arranged in a way that creates a chiral axis, the molecule would exhibit axial chirality.

If that's the case, then compound 1 would exhibit optical isomerism. So, then the compounds that exhibit optical isomerism are 1 and 2.

So, looking at the options, option D is 1 and 2.

Hmm, but earlier I thought that compound 1 wasn't chiral because the substituents were symmetric. But perhaps I was wrong, and it is chiral. So, in that case, the answer would be option A (1,2,4) or option D (1 and 2). Wait, no, because I thought only 1 and 2 are correct.

Wait, but earlier I concluded that 4 doesn't have optical isomerism. So the correct answer would be D) 1 and 2.

But wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to find another approach.

Another approach: identifying which compounds have chiral centers or axial chirality.

1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

Does this have a chiral center? Let's look.

Each benzene ring has substituents at 2 and 6, and the rings are connected at 1 and 1'.

In a biphenyl structure, the substituents can cause the molecule to have axial chirality. Axial chirality occurs when the two substituents on each phenyl ring are on opposite sides of the central bond, leading to a chiral axis.

In this case, each ring has two substituents: methyl ester at 2 and nitro at 6. So, for each ring, substituents are across from each other. But when connected to the other ring, the arrangement could lead to a chiral axis.

So, the molecule would have axial chirality if the substituents on each ring are arranged in a way that they can't be mirrored across the central bond.

So, I think compound 1 does exhibit axial chirality, hence optical isomerism.

So, compounds 1 and 2 exhibit optical isomerism. Therefore, option D is the correct answer.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine which compounds exhibit optical isomerism, we analyze each compound for the presence of chirality. Optical isomerism occurs when a compound has a chiral center (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups) or axial chirality (restricted rotation around a bond causing non-superimposable mirror images).

### Analysis of Each Compound:

1. **Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**  
   - This compound consists of two benzene rings connected at the 1 and 1' positions. Each ring has a methyl ester at position 2 and a nitro group at position 6.  
   - The substituents at positions 2 and 6 are across from each other on each ring. The arrangement of these substituents relative to the central bond can lead to axial chirality, as the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry.  
   - **Conclusion**: This compound exhibits optical isomerism due to axial chirality.

2. **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**  
   - The structure is CH₃-C(OH)-COOCH₃. The central carbon (C2) is bonded to four different groups: OH, CH₃, COOCH₃, and H.

   - **Conclusion**: This compound exhibits optical isomerism.

3. **Benzophenone**  
   - The structure is (Ph)₂C=O, where two phenyl groups are attached to a carbonyl group.  
   - The central carbon is double-bonded to oxygen and bonded to two identical phenyl groups. It does not have four different substituents, so it lacks a chiral center.

4. **Dimethyl Fumarate**  
   - The structure is (E)-CH₂=CH(COOCH₃)₂, with the two COOCH₃ groups on opposite sides of the double bond.  
   - The carbons in the double bond are each bonded to two identical COOCH₃ groups, so they are not chiral centers. The molecule also has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral.  
   - **Conclusion**: This compound does not exhibit optical isomerism.

### Final Answer:
Compounds 1 and 2 exhibit optical isomerism due to axial chirality and the presence of a chiral center, respectively. The correct option is:

**Answer: D**
