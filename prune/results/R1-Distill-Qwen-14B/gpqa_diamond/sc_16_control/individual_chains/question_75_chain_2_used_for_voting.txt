Okay, so I'm trying to figure out why the GADD45G protein isn't being overexpressed in the mouse model. Let's go through the problem step by step.

The setup is that the researcher created a transgenic mouse model to overexpress GADD45G by using an inducible system. They introduced a sequence for the hemagglutinin (HA) tag at the N-terminus of the protein. They transfected the plasmid into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells using Lipofectamine and selected antibiotic-resistant colonies. But when they tested the expression, the protein wasn't overexpressed as expected.

Looking at the provided DNA sequence, I notice it's the plus strand. Let me go through the sequence to see if anything stands out.

First, the sequence starts with ATG, which is the start codon. So that's good. Then, the sequence continues with some codons. Wait, but then after a while, there's a TGA. Hmm. TGA is a stop codon. Oh wait, in DNA, TGA is complementary to CAT on the mRNA, but wait, wait—no. Wait, DNA is double-stranded, so the mRNA is synthesized off the template strand. So in the plus strand, the TGA is a stop codon in the coding sequence, because the mRNA would be complementary. Let me think about it.

Wait, the coding DNA strand is the one that's similar to the mRNA except T replaces U. So if the plus strand (coding) has a TGA, that would be the same as the mRNA's UGA, which is a stop codon. So the presence of a TGA in the middle of the coding sequence could be a problem. That would mean the mRNA would have a stop codon, causing the ribosome to terminate early.

Looking at the sequence provided, I see that further along, there's a TGA at position... Let me count the letters. Let's see, the sequence is quite long, but I can spot it. The sequence has ... CTCGTACGCTG ... wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I can look for the HA tag sequence. HA is usually a peptide tag, like YPYDVPDYA. But in the DNA, it would be the codons for that.

Wait, the construct is modified to have the HA tag at the N-terminus. So the HA coding sequence should be at the beginning. Let me look at the beginning of the provided sequence.

The sequence starts with ATG (start), then TAC. TAC is Tyr (codon 2). Then CCATACGATGTT... Hmm, the HA tag would be a short peptide, so the DNA sequence should have the corresponding codons right after the start. Let me look up the DNA sequence for the HA tag. The HA tag is derived from the influenza HA protein. The amino acid sequence is usually YPYDVPDYA. Let me get the DNA sequence for that.

YPYDVPDYA in amino acids translates to DNA as:

Y: TAC
P: CCA
Y: TAC
D: GAT
V: GTT
P: CCA
D: GAT
Y: TAC
A: GCT

Wait, wait, no. Wait, the DNA coding strand for each amino acid:

Y: TAC
P: CCA
Y: TAC
D: GAT
V: GTT
P: CCA
D: GAT
Y: TAC
A: GCT

So the HA tag should be TACCCA TACGAT GTTCCA GATAC GCT.

Wait, but let me check the beginning of the given DNA sequence. The sequence starts with ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCAGATTACGCCAAATGACTCTGGAAGAAGTCCGCGGCCAGGACACAGTTCCGGAAAGCACAGCCAGGATGCAGGGTGCCGGGAAAGCGCTGCATGAGTTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA

Wait, the HA tag should be about 10 amino acids, so looking at the first few codons, the first 10 would be:

1. ATG (start)
2. TAC (Tyr)
3. CCA (Pro)
4. TAC (Tyr)
5. GAT (Asp)
6. GTT (Val)
7. CCAGATTACGCCAAATGACTCTGGAAGAAGTC... Wait, wait, that can't be right. Because the HA tag should be about 10 amino acids, which is 30 nucleotides.

Wait, the initial part after ATG is TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA... Let me count the letters. Let's see, the sequence starts as ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCAGATTACGCCAAATGACTCTGGAAGAAGTCCGCGGCCAGGACACAGTTCCGGAAAGCACAGCCAGGATGCAGGGTGCCGGGAAAGCGCTGCATGAGTTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA.

Wait, so the initial part is ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCAGAT... That's 12 codons, which is 36 nucleotides. But the HA tag is about 11 amino acids, so 33 nucleotides. So maybe the HA is in the first part.

Wait, but looking at the first 30 nucleotides:

ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC A...

Wait, that's 10 codons (30 nucleotides). Let me write them as codons:

1. ATG (start)
2. TAC (Tyr)
3. CCA (Pro)
4. TAC (Tyr)
5. GAT (Asp)
6. GTT (Val)
7. CCA (Pro)
8. GAT (Asp)
9. TAC (Tyr)
10. GCC (Ala)
11. AAA (Lys)
Wait, but HA is YPYDVPDYA, which is 9 amino acids. Wait, maybe the first 10 codons include the HA tag. Let me see.

The HA tag is YPYDVPDYA.

Breaking it into codons:

YP: Tyr Pro (TAC CCA)
YD: Tyr Asp (TAC GAT)
VP: Val Pro (GTT CCA)
DY: Asp Tyr (GAT TAC)
A: Ala (GCT)

Wait, but the actual sequence may differ. Let me recount the initial part.

The first few codons after ATG are:

1. ATG (start)
2. TAC (Tyr)
3. CCA (Pro)
4. TAC (Tyr)
5. GAT (Asp)
6. GTT (Val)
7. CCA (Pro)
8. GAT (Asp)
9. TAC (Tyr)
10. GCC (Ala)
11. AAA (Lys)
12. ... etc.

Hmm, that's 12 codons into the sequence. The HA tag is YPYDVPDYA, which is 9 amino acids. So the first 9 codons would be:

1. ATG (start)
2. TAC (Tyr)
3. CCA (Pro)
4. TAC (Tyr)
5. GAT (Asp)
6. GTT (Val)
7. CCA (Pro)
8. GAT (Asp)
9. TAC (Tyr)
10. GCC (Ala)
11. AAA (Lys)
12. ... etc.

Wait, so YPYDVPDYA would be 9 amino acids. So in the DNA, that's 9 codons. So first codon is ATG, then the next 9 for the HA tag.

Wait, but looking at the sequence, after ATG, the next codons are TAC, CCA, TAC, GAT, GTT, CCA, GAT, TAC, GCC.

So the HA would be Tyr Pro Tyr Asp Val Pro Asp Tyr Ala. But the intended HA is YPYDVPDYA, which is Tyr Pro Tyr Asp Val Pro Asp Tyr Ala.

Wait, that seems to match. So the first 11 codons (including start) would be ATG followed by the HA tag codons.

But wait, the 10th codon after ATG is GCC, which is Ala. So that's the 9th amino acid, A.

So that would make the HA tag correctly present.

But then why isn't the protein being expressed?

Looking further into the sequence, I notice a TGA later on. For example, in the sequence, I think there's a TGA in the middle. Let me find that.

Looking through the sequence, I see ... GCATGAGTTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA.

Wait, I see 'TGA' in the sequence. Let's check the context. For example, in the middle, there's a 'TGA' in the DNA. That would code for a stop codon in the mRNA.

Wait, because in the coding (plus) strand, the TGA is a stop codon. So the DNA has TGA in the coding sequence, which would transcribe to UGA in the mRNA, a stop codon. So the ribosome would terminate translation there.

So the construct includes a TGA stop codon in the middle of the coding sequence, which would terminate the production of the protein early. That's why the protein isn't being overexpressed—the mRNA is being cut short.

Looking at the options:

A) The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation. That would change the amino acid, but not necessarily stop it.

B) The ribosome terminated the translation early. That's because of a stop codon in the mRNA.

C) The lack of the linker sequence is triggering proteolysis of the nascent chain. Maybe, but the issue here seems to be transcription/translation.

D) The tRNA for the UAA codon does not exist in the mouse. Wait, but UAA is a stop codon, but the mRNA here would have UGA. Also, the stop codons are UAA, UAG, UGA. So if the mRNA has UGA, the tRNA for UAA isn't relevant. Also, all stop codons are read by the release factors, not tRNAs.

So the issue is the presence of a TGA in the coding sequence, leading to a premature stop codon.

Looking at the options, option B says the ribosome terminated early. That's correct. Alternatively, option D is about the tRNA for UAA, but the codon here is UGA, so D isn't the issue.

So the correct answer is B. Because the presence of a TGA in the coding sequence leads to a premature stop codon, causing the ribosome to terminate early, leading to a truncated protein that might not be detected, or no protein at all.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The researcher is attempting to overexpress the GADD45G protein in a mouse model by introducing an HA tag at the N-terminus. However, the protein is not being expressed as expected. The provided DNA sequence contains a TGA codon in the coding strand, which corresponds to a stop codon (UGA) in the mRNA. This stop codon appears in the middle of the coding sequence, causing the ribosome to terminate translation prematurely. As a result, the full-length protein is not produced, leading to the lack of overexpression.

### Analysis of the Options:
- **A) The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation:**  
  A missense mutation would alter an amino acid in the HA tag but would not necessarily cause a premature stop codon. This does not explain the lack of protein expression.

- **B) The ribosome terminated the translation early:**  
  The presence of the TGA codon in the DNA sequence leads to the introduction of a stop codon (UGA) in the mRNA. This causes the ribosome to terminate translation prematurely, resulting in the production of a truncated or non-functional protein. This is consistent with the observed lack of overexpression.

- **C) The lack of the linker sequence is triggering proteolysis of the nascent chain:**  
  Proteolysis refers to the degradation of the protein after it is synthesized. However, the issue here is the premature termination of translation due to the stop codon, which occurs earlier in the process. This option does not explain the lack of protein expression.

- **D) The tRNA for the UAA codon does not exist in the mouse:**  
  The stop codon in the mRNA is UGA, not UAA. Additionally, stop codons are recognized by release factors, not tRNAs. This option is irrelevant to the observed problem.

### Conclusion:
The presence of the TGA codon in the coding sequence causes the ribosome to terminate translation early, preventing the expression of the full-length protein. This aligns with option **B**.
