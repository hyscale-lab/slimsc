Okay, so I need to figure out which planet has a higher probability of transiting. I remember that the transit method involves a planet passing in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the alignment of the orbit.

The question says both planets have the same mass, but different orbital periods. Planet_1's period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. So Planet_1 is closer to its star, right? And the host stars have the same radii even though one is more massive. So the host star of Planet_1 is twice as massive as Planet_2's star, but same radius. That must mean that Planet_1's star is more massive but not larger—so perhaps it's either hotter or maybe a main-sequence star.

Wait, the probability of transit is given by (R_planet / R_star)² multiplied by something else. Oh wait, I think the formula for the probability is (R_p / a) * (something else?), but wait, no, the transit probability is approximately (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1/(1 - e²))^½, but since both orbits are circular (e=0), that part is 1. So the probability simplifies to (R_p / R_s)^2.

Wait, no, wait. I think I'm mixing things up. The transit probability is actually the geometric probability, which is (R_p + R_s) / a, but wait no, I think it's (R_p / a) * something else. Let me think. Oh, I remember now, the geometric probability is (R_p / a) * (1/(1 - (R_p/a)^2 )^(1/2)) ). Or maybe it's (R_p/(R_s)) * (R_s/a) * (something else). Hmm, perhaps I should look up the formula, but since I can't, I need to think.

Alternatively, perhaps the transit probability is approximately (R_p / R_s )^2 multiplied by (1/a), but I'm not sure. Wait, another approach: the probability that the planet's orbit, as seen from Earth, intersects our line of sight. Since the orbits are circular and edge-on transits are needed, the probability is proportional to the ratio of the planet's size to the star's size? Or perhaps it's the ratio of the orbital distance to something else.

Wait, no, the geometric probability is given by (R_p / a) * (1 / (sin i)), but if the orbits are randomly oriented, the probability is (R_p / a) * (1 / cos i). Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me try to recall the formula correctly.

The transit probability is the area where the planet's orbital plane intersects our line of sight, divided by the total possible area. So it's actually (R_p / a) * (1 / (sqrt(1 - (R_p/a)^2)) )) but that might not be correct. Alternatively, the approximate probability is (R_p / a)^2, but that doesn't account for all factors.

Alternatively, I remember that the probability P is approximately (R_p / R_*)^2 * (1 / (1 - (R_p / a)^2 )) )^(1/2), but this is getting complicated. Maybe it's better to think in terms of the formula for the transit probability.

Wait, I think the correct formula for the transit probability is P ≈ (R_p / R_*)^2 * (1 / (1 - (R_p / a)^2 )) )^(1/2). But no, perhaps that's not right. Alternatively, the formula is simply (R_p / R_*)^2 divided by (1 - (R_p / a)^2 )^(1/2), but I'm not confident.

Alternatively, another approach: the transit probability depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the orbital distance. The chance that the orbit is aligned edge-on is proportional to the ratio of the star's radius to the distance between the star and planet (a). So, the probability is (R_p / a) * (R_* / a), but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula for the geometric transit probability is (R_p / a) * (sqrt(1 - (R_p/a)^2 )) / (1 - (R_p/a)^2 ), but I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think in terms of the formula I know.

Wait, I remember that the transit probability is given by (R_p / R_*)² * (1 / (1 - (R_p / a)^2 )^(1/2)) ), but I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the probability is proportional to (R_p^2) / (a^2) multiplied by the solid angle.

Alternatively, the formula I should be using is the transit probability P = (R_p + R_*) / a * (R_* / a) but that doesn't seem right either.

Wait, perhaps a smarter approach is to think about the key factors that affect transit probability. The main factors are the size of the planet relative to the star and the size of the orbit. A larger planet (relative to the star) increases the probability, and a smaller orbital distance (a) also makes the probability higher because the planet's path is more likely to cross our line of sight.

So, in this problem, both planets have the same mass, but their host stars have the same radius. So R_p is the same for both, since the masses are same and if the stars are same radius, but wait, same mass? No, the planets have same mass, but the stars are different.

Wait, the question says both have Earth-like planets, so same mass. So R_p is same for both planets.

But the host stars have same radii. So R_*1 = R_*2.

So, R_p is same, R_* same, but a is different.

Wait, but how does a affect the transit probability? The orbital period is given. Since the planets are detected via RV, we know their minimum masses, but for this problem, perhaps the orbital periods are known, so we can find the semi-major axis.

Wait, the orbital period P is related to a via Kepler's third law: (a^3) / (P^2) = (G(M_* + M_p)) / (4π²). But since M_p is much smaller than M_*, we can approximate a^3 ≈ (G M_*) P^2 / (4π²).

So, a is proportional to (M_* )^(1/3) * P^(2/3).

Wait, because a^3 is proportional to M_* * P^2, so a is proportional to (M_* )^(1/3) * P^(2/3).

So, for Planet 1, M_*1 is twice that of M_*2. Let's denote M_*2 as M. So M_*1 = 2M.

And P1 is (1/3) P2, because Planet_1's period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. Let me denote P_2 as P, so P_1 = P/3.

So, a1 is proportional to (2M)^(1/3) * (P/3)^(2/3).

Let me compute a1 and a2.

a1 ∝ (2)^(1/3) * (1/3)^(2/3) * M^(1/3) * P^(2/3).

a2 ∝ (M)^(1/3) * (P)^(2/3).

So the ratio a1 / a2 = [ (2)^(1/3) * (1/3)^(2/3) ] / [1] = (2/3^2)^(1/3) = (2/9)^(1/3) ≈ (0.222)^(1/3) ≈ 0.6.

So a1 is about 0.6 times a2.

So a1 is smaller than a2.

Now, transit probability P is proportional to (R_p / R_*)² * (R_* / a)^2, but I'm not sure. Wait, no, earlier I thought the transit probability is (R_p / R_*)^2. But perhaps it's (R_p / a)^2 times (R_* / a)^2? Not sure.

Wait, I think I'm getting confused. Let me think about the formula again. The transit probability is approximately (R_p / R_*)² multiplied by (R_* / a)^2? No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the transit probability P is approximately (R_p / R_*)^2 * (1/(1 - (R_p/a)^2 )) ), but since R_p is much smaller than a, (R_p/a) is small, so 1/(1 - (R_p/a)^2) ≈ 1. So P ≈ (R_p/R_*)^2.

Wait, but in that case, if R_p and R_* are same for both planets, then P would be same. But that can't be right because a is different.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Another approach: because the star's radius is same, but the orbital distance varies.

Wait, the transit probability is higher when the planet is closer to the star because the planet's orbit is more likely to cross our line of sight. So closer planets (smaller a) have higher probability.

Wait, another way: the probability of transit is proportional to (R_p + R_*)^2 / a².

Wait, that makes sense. Because the area where the planet's orbit would block the star is a circle of radius R_p + R_*, and the area of the star is π R_*². So the probability is ( (R_p + R_*) / a )² * (R_*² / a² )? Not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula for the transit probability is (R_p + R_*) / a * (R_* / a) )? No, that doesn't seem right.

Wait, I think I'm overcomplicating. Let me look for online sources.

Wait, I can't do that, but I remember that the transit probability P is given by:

P ≈ (R_p / R_*)² * (1 / (1 - (R_p / a)^2 ))^(1/2)

But if R_p << a, then (R_p/a)^2 is negligible, so P ≈ (R_p/R_*)².

But in that case, if both R_p and R_* are same for both planets, then P would be same.

But that can't be the case because the options suggest P varies.

So perhaps I'm wrong. Maybe the transit probability depends on the ratio of R_* to a, as well as R_p to a.

Another approach: The transit probability is the ratio of the area of the planet's disk to the area of the star's disk, multiplied by the probability that the planet's orbital plane is aligned such that the transit occurs. The alignment probability is approximately (R_* / a), because the angle required for transit is when the inclination i is 90 degrees. The solid angle for that is (R_* / a)^2 * π, so the probability is approximately (R_* / a)^2 * (R_p / R_*)^2.

Wait, that makes the transit probability P = (R_p / R_*)^2 * (R_* / a)^2 = (R_p^2 R_*^2) / (a^2 R_*^2) ) = (R_p^2) / a^2.

So P = (R_p / a)^2.

Hmm, but R_p is same for both planets, since same mass and stars same radius but same mass? Wait, same mass doesn't necessarily mean same radius. Oh wait, the planets have same masses, but their radii could be different. Oh wait, the question doesn't specify that. Hmm.

Wait, the question says the planets have same mass, but it doesn't say same radius. So perhaps R_p is same? Because for Earth-like planets, same mass would imply same radius, but perhaps more massive ones have higher radius, but wait, Earth's mass and radius are fixed. Hmm, perhaps I can assume that both planets have same radius.

But the question doesn't say that, so maybe I shouldn't assume that. So, I'm stuck. How else can I approach this?

Wait, the stars have same radius. The planets have same mass. But radius of the planet: for a given mass, a larger planet would have a higher radius. But without knowing their densities, I can't say their radii are same. Hmm, this complicates things.

Wait, but the question says both planets have Earth-like. So perhaps their radii are similar to Earth. So R_p1 and R_p2 are same as Earth's radius.

Then, transit probability P = (R_p / a)^2.

So, since a1 is smaller than a2, P1 would be larger.

So, the closer the planet is to the star, the higher the probability of transit.

So, Planet_1 has a smaller a than Planet_2. Therefore, P1 > P2.

So, the researchers should choose Planet_1.

Wait, but let's compute the ratio.

We have a1 / a2 = (2/1)^(1/3) * (1/3)^(2/3) ) = (2^(1/3)) * (3^(-2/3)) )

= 2^(1/3) / 3^(2/3) = (2/9)^(1/3) ≈ (0.222)^(1/3) ≈ 0.6.

So a1 = 0.6 a2.

Then, P1 = (R_p / a1 )^2 = (R_p / (0.6 a2) )^2 = (R_p / a2 )^2 * (1/0.6)^2 ≈ (1/0.36) times P2.

Wait, because P2 is (R_p / a2 )^2.

So, P1 is (1 / (0.6)^2 ) times P2.

0.6 squared is 0.36. 1/0.36 is approximately 2.777...

So P1 is about 2.77 times higher than P2.

Wait, that would mean Planet_1 has a higher probability. So the researchers should choose Planet_1.

Looking back at the options:

Option D) says Planet_1 is preferred due to ~2.7 times higher probability.

So the correct answer is D.

But wait, let me recheck the calculation.

a1 = ( (M_1)^(1/3) * (P1)^(2/3) ) / ( (M_2)^(1/3) * (P2)^(2/3) ) )

M_1 = 2 M_2, P1 = P2/3.

So,

a1/a2 = [ (2)^(1/3) * (1/3)^(2/3) ) ] / 1

= 2^(1/3) * 3^(-2/3) = (2) / (3^2) )^(1/3) = (2/9)^(1/3) ≈ 0.6.

So a1 = 0.6 a2.

Thus, (R_p/a1)^2 = (R_p/(0.6 a2))^2 = (1/(0.6)^2) * (R_p/a2)^2 = (1/0.36) * (R_p/a2)^2 ≈ 2.777... * (R_p/a2)^2.

So P1 = 2.777 * P2.

So P1/P2 ≈ 2.777, which is about 2.7 times.

Looking at the options:

Option D says 2.7 times, so D is correct.

To determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting, we analyze the transit probability formula. The transit probability \( P \) is proportional to \( \left(\frac{R_p}{a}\right)^2 \), where \( R_p \) is the planet's radius and \( a \) is the orbital distance. Since both planets have the same mass and the host stars have the same radius, \( R_p \) is assumed to be the same for both planets. Thus, the probability depends on the orbital distance \( a \), with closer planets (smaller \( a \)) having higher transit probabilities.

Using Kepler's third law, \( a^3 \propto M_* P^2 \), where \( M_* \) is the host star's mass and \( P \) is the orbital period, we calculate the ratio of the orbital distances \( a_1 \) (for Planet_1) and \( a_2 \) (for Planet_2). Given that \( M_*1 = 2M_*2 \) and \( P_1 = \frac{P_2}{3} \), we find:

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left(\frac{M_*1}{M_*2}\right)^{1/3} \left(\frac{P_1}{P_2}\right)^{2/3} = \left(\frac{2}{1}\right)^{1/3} \left(\frac{1/3}{1}\right)^{2/3} = 2^{1/3} \cdot 3^{-2/3}.
\]

Simplifying, \( \frac{a_1}{a_2} \approx 0.6 \), meaning \( a_1 \) is smaller than \( a_2 \). Since \( P \propto \left(\frac{R_p}{a}\right)^2 \), the transit probability for Planet_1 is:

\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \left(\frac{a_2}{a_1}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{1}{0.6}\right)^2 \approx 2.777.
\]

Thus, Planet_1 has approximately 2.7 times higher transit probability than Planet_2. The researchers should prioritize observing Planet_1.
