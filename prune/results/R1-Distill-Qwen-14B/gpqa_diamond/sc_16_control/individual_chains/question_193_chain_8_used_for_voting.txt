Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with all the concepts yet. But let's take it step by step. The question is about how the number of stars changes with distance, given a certain relationship between the number of stars and parallax. Hmm.

The problem states that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. So, mathematically, that's N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Wait, parallax is usually denoted as 'p' sometimes, but here it's plx, which I think is just another symbol for parallax. So N is inversely proportional to plx^5. Got it.

Now, I remember that parallax (p) is related to distance (d). The formula I recall is p = 1/d, where d is in parsecs. Oh wait, right, because parallax in arcseconds is the reciprocal of distance in parsecs. So if d increases, p decreases. So d = 1/p, or p = 1/d.

Wait, the question is about how the number of stars (N) changes with distance. So I need to express N in terms of distance and then see how N varies as r (distance) changes.

Let me write down what I have:

N ∝ 1/(plx)^5.

Since p = 1/d, substituting that in gives N ∝ 1/( (1/d) )^5. Let me compute that exponent first. (1/d)^5 is 1/d^5. So the reciprocal of that is d^5. So N is proportional to d^5.

Wait, wait. Let me be precise. N ∝ 1/( (1/d) )^5. That equals d^5. So N is proportional to d^5. So as distance increases, the number of stars increases with the fifth power of d.

But wait, the question is about how the number of stars changes per unit range of distance. Oh, right, so they're asking about the change in N as r (distance) changes by a small amount. Which makes me think about the derivative of N with respect to r.

Because if N is proportional to r^5, then when you take the derivative dN/dr, you get 5*r^4. So the change in the number of stars per unit distance is proportional to r^4. So the number of stars increases with the fourth power of the distance as you move a unit distance.

Wait, but wait again. Let me make sure. Let me think about it differently. Suppose N = k * (d)^5, where k is the constant of proportionality. Then, the number of stars in a thin shell between d and d + dr would be N = k * [ (d+dr)^5 - d^5 ].

But for small dr, this can be approximated using derivatives. The differential change dN is approximately 5k d^4 dr. So dN/dr = 5k d^4. Hmm, okay, so the number of stars per unit distance (dN/dr) is proportional to d^4. So as distance increases, the density of stars (number per unit volume) in that shell increases as r^4.

Wait, but the question says "how does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?" Oh wait, perhaps I misread. It's not about the number per unit volume, but the number per unit distance. Wait, but that would be the surface density if it's a region of the sky. Because the sky is a 2D area, not accounting for depth. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused here.

Wait, no, the problem says 'number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5.' Parallax is related to distance, but how does the density of stars in the sky (which is like surface density) relate to distance?

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of volume. The number of stars in a certain region depends on the volume. But wait, the question is about a specific region of the sky, so it's a fixed area but varying depth. So the number of stars in that region would depend on how many are located at different distances. 

If the number of stars per unit volume at a distance d is proportional to d^5, then the number of stars in a thin shell of radius d and thickness dr would be (number density) * volume element. The volume element is 4π d² dr. So number of stars in shell is (k d^5) * (4π d² dr) ) = 4π k d^7 dr.

Wait, but that's not matching what I thought earlier. Alternatively, perhaps the number of stars is proportional to 1/p^5 and since p is 1/d, that would make it proportional to d^5 per unit volume.

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me approach this differently. Let's model the problem.

Assume that the number of stars in a small volume element is proportional to 1/p^5. Since p = 1/d, this becomes proportional to d^5. So the number of stars per unit volume (number density) is proportional to d^5.

But the number of stars in a shell between d and d+dr would be the number density multiplied by the volume of the shell. The volume of the shell is 4π d² dr. So the number of stars in that shell is proportional to d^5 * d² dr = d^7 dr.

Wait, but the question is about how the number of stars in that region of the sky changes with distance per unit range. So if you have a region of the sky, and you're looking at a thin slice (like a shell) of thickness dr, the number of stars in that slice would be proportional to d^5 (number density) multiplied by the area of the shell. Wait, but the shell's area is 4π d², but in the context of a specific region of the sky, perhaps we're considering a fixed area, so the volume element would be area * dr. Because the region is a certain area on the sky, so the volume is area × dr, where dr is the distance range.

Wait, that makes sense. So if the region has an area A, then the volume of the shell is A * dr. So the number of stars in that shell would be number density × volume.

Number density is proportional to d^5. Volume is A dr.

So number of stars N_shell = (k d^5) * (A dr) ) = k A d^5 dr.

So the number of stars per unit distance (dr) is proportional to d^5. So as the distance r increases, the number of stars per unit distance increases as r^5.

Wait, but that would mean the answer is B) ~ r^5. But I'm confused because earlier when I thought about the derivative, I thought it was r^4.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the derivative approach. Let me go back to that. If N = k r^5, then dN/dr = 5k r^4, which is proportional to r^4. So the number of stars per unit distance increases as r^4.

But according to the shell approach, it's r^5. So I'm getting conflicting results. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the number of stars as a function of distance. Let me clarify. The question says the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5.

So N ∝ 1/(plx)^5.

Since plx = 1/d, N ∝ d^5.

Wait, but that can't be right because if d increases, N would increase, but in reality, the number of stars we observe in a region of the sky actually decreases with distance because they are farther away and harder to see. Wait, but the question states that N varies as 1/plx^5. So perhaps in this problem, the number of stars is higher for larger d, which is contrary to real-life expectations but is a given condition.

So given that, N = k d^5. So when you consider a thin shell at distance d with thickness dr, the number of stars in that shell would be proportional to d^5. Because N = k d^5, and the shell's contribution is the derivative dN/dr = 5k d^4. Wait, no, because if N is the cumulative number up to distance d, then the number in the shell is dN = (dN/dd) dr. So dN/dd is 5k d^4, so dN is 5k d^4 dr. So the number per unit distance (dr) is 5k d^4. So the number of stars per unit distance increases as d^4, which would be option C (~ r^4).

Wait, that's conflicting with the earlier shell approach. Where did I go wrong?

Wait, perhaps I messed up the initial setup. The problem says that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So N ∝ 1/plx^5. Since plx = 1/d, N ∝ d^5. So N is the number of stars as a function of distance. So when d increases, N increases as d^5. 

But how does the number of stars in a region change per unit distance? That would be the derivative of N with respect to d. So dN/dd = 5 k d^4. So the number of stars per unit distance increases with d^4.

So the answer would be C) ~ r^4.

Wait, but earlier when I thought about the shell, I considered N_shell = k d^5 * A dr, which would imply the number of stars increases as d^5 per unit distance. But that approach might be incorrect because perhaps N is already the total number up to distance d, not the density.

Hmm. Let me think again.

If N(d) is the total number of stars up to distance d, then dN/dd is the number of stars per unit distance (the density). So if N ∝ d^5, then dN/dd ∝ d^4. So the answer is C.

But wait, the question says 'how does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)'. So it's the rate of change of N with respect to r. So in this case, dN/dr is proportional to r^4. So the correct option is C) ~ r^4.

So the answer should be C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem states that the number of stars varies with parallax as \( N \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^5} \), where parallax (\( \text{plx} \)) is related to distance (\( d \)) by \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \). Substituting this relationship, \( N \propto d^5 \). This means the number of stars increases as the distance \( d \) increases, following a \( d^5 \) dependence.

To determine how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance (\( r \)), we calculate the derivative of \( N \) with respect to \( r \). Since \( N \propto d^5 \), the derivative is:

\[
\frac{dN}{dr} \propto 5d^4.
\]

This shows that the number of stars per unit distance increases as \( r^4 \). Therefore, the correct answer is:
