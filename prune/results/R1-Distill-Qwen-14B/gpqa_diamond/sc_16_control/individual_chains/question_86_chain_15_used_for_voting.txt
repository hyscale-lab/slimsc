Okay, so I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem. Let me read through it again.

The problem says that a chemist performed two reactions using two different reducing agents on two unknown compounds, A and B. The products are (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, respectively. The question is asking me to choose the correct starting materials A and B from the given options.

Hmm, I remember that when you reduce a ketone, you typically get a secondary alcohol. But wait, in this case, the products are cyclic ketones. Oh wait, no, wait. Tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one is a cyclic ether with a ketone. So maybe the starting material is a ketone with an adjacent ether group?

Wait, no, I think I'm getting confused. Let's think about the reaction. LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent. BH3 is also a reducing agent, but I think it's used in the formation of alcohols from ketones, but wait, I'm not sure. Or wait, maybe these reactions are about epoxide reduction or something else.

Wait, the product is a tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. That structure has a five-membered ring because pyran is six-membered, but tetrahydro-2H-pyran would have a ring with one double bond. Wait, no, pyran is a six-membered ring with one oxygen, like a cyclic ether. Wait, no, pyran is similar to pyrone, which is a cyclic ester with an oxygen. Or maybe not. Let me think. Pyran is a six-membered ring, oxygen in one position, and then two double bonds? Or maybe it's a five-membered ring? No, no, I think pyran is six-membered, like furan is five. So tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one would have a six-membered ring with one oxygen, and a ketone group. So, the structure would be a cyclic hemiacetal or something similar.

Wait, perhaps the product is a cyclic hemiacetal. Let me think about the starting materials. Oh wait, maybe the starting material is an ester or a ketone with an ether group attached.

Wait, another approach. When you reduce a ketone with a borohydride, like LiBH4, you get an alcohol. But in this case, the product is a cyclic ketone. So perhaps the starting material is a cyclic hemiacetal, and the reduction opens it up? Or maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is about the reduction of a cyclic ketone into a diol or something. No, wait, the product is a cyclic ketone as well. Wait, no, the product is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. So the structure would be a six-membered ring (pyran), with the ketone at position 2, and an ethyl group at position 4. So the ring would have the oxygen in position 2, I think. Wait, numbering might be different.

Let me try to draw it mentally. The ring is six-membered with oxygen. The ketone is at position 2. So the ring has an oxygen at position 1, and the ketone (a carbonyl group) at position 2. The ethyl group is at position 4. So the ring structure would be O-C(=O)-C-O-C-ethyl, but wait, that might not make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the structure has a ring where the oxygen is at position 1, the ketone at position 2, and the ethyl at position 4.

But how does this product form from the starting materials? Looking at the options, the starting materials are all 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acids. Wait, that's interesting. So, 5-oxopentanoic acid with substituents.

Wait, the starting material is pentanoic acid with a substituent on the 5th carbon (the carbonyl group) and an isobutoxy group. So the structure would be:

CH2CH2CH(OCH(CH2)2CH3)COOH ?

Wait, perhaps it's more precise to think of it as:

The starting material is (S) or (R) configured 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. So it's a five-carbon chain, with a ketone (oxo) on carbon 5, and an isobutoxy group (OCH(CH2)2CH3) attached to the same carbon. Carbon 3 has an ethyl group.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-C(O)-OCH(CH2CH3)2 ?

Wait, no, the substituents are on the same carbon as the ketone. So the 5th carbon (carbon 5) is where the oxo group is, and the same carbon has an isobutoxy group and an ethyl group? Wait, that can't be right because a carbon can't have three substituents plus the ketone. Wait, perhaps the structure is:

The molecule is pentanoic acid (five carbons), with substituents on the 3rd and 5th carbons.

So, the 5th carbon is a carbonyl (COOH?), but wait, wait, the starting material is 5-oxo, so it's a ketone, not a carboxylic acid. Wait, the starting material is 5-oxopentanoic acid. So that would be a five-carbon chain where the fifth carbon is a ketone (oxo) and the first carbon is the carboxylic acid.

Wait, pentanoic acid is CH2CH2CH2CH2COOH. So 5-oxopentanoic acid would have a ketone on the fifth carbon. Wait, that's actually the same as the carboxylic acid group. That can't be right. Wait, maybe I'm numbering wrong. Let me think: pentanoic acid is CH3CH2CH2CH2COOH. So the carboxylic acid is on C-1, then C-2, C-3, C-4, C-5 is the methyl end. Wait, but that might not help. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is better thought of as:

The compound is 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. So, the carboxylic acid is on C-1, and the chain goes C-1 (COOH), C-2, C-3 (with ethyl group), C-4, C-5 (with isobutoxy and oxo groups).

Wait, that's getting a bit confusing. Let me try to write the structure:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-CH2-C(O-OCH(CH2CH3)2)

Wait, no, the 5-oxopentanoic acid would have the structure:

CH2CH2CH2C(O)COOH?

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a substituted cyclopentanone or something else. I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should think about the reaction instead.

The product is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. So that's a cyclic ether with a ketone. The starting material is being treated with a reducing agentâ€”LiBH4 and BH3. Wait, LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, typically used to reduce carbonyl groups to alcohols. BH3 is used in hydroboration reactions, but when used with THF or other solvents, it can also act as a reducing agent, perhaps for ketones to alcohols as well.

Wait, but in these reactions, the starting material is a pentanoic acid derivative. So maybe the reaction is about reducing a ketone group into an alcohol, which then undergoes cyclization to form the cyclic ketone product.

Wait, if the starting material has a ketone group (5-oxo), and an isobutoxy group, perhaps the reaction is a reduction of the ketone to an alcohol, followed by elimination or some kind of cyclization.

Alternatively, maybe the starting material is an ester, but the question says it's a pentanoic acid. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: the product is a cyclic hemiacetal, perhaps. When a carbonyl compound undergoes a reduction, could it form a cyclic structure?

Wait, let's think about the product structure again. 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.

Pyran is a six-membered ring with an oxygen. The 'tetrahydro' implies that some of the double bonds are reduced. So, in 2H-pyran-2-one, the ring would have one double bond. The '2H' suggests that the hydrogen is at position 2, which is the same as the carbonyl group. So, the structure would be a six-membered ring with an oxygen in one position and a ketone in another. The ethyl group is at position 4.

So, maybe the product is formed when a diol or a hemiacetal is formed from the starting material.

Wait, but the starting material is a pentanoic acid derivative. Maybe the reaction involves forming a cyclic ether through an acid-catalyzed cyclization after reduction.

Let me think about the reaction steps. Suppose the starting material is a ketone with an adjacent alcohol group. Then, upon treatment with acid, it could cyclize to form an ether.

Wait, but in the problem, the starting materials are treated with LiBH4 and BH3. So, perhaps the starting materials are esters or another functional group that can be reduced.

Wait, another thought: maybe the starting material is an acetal or ketal. When you reduce an acetal, you typically get an alcohol. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic hemiacetal, and the reduction is opening it up. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, perhaps the starting materials are epoxides, and the reducing agents are opening them. But LiBH4 doesn't usually open epoxides; perhaps acidic conditions would do that.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is about the reduction of a ketone to an alcohol, and then cyclization occurs. For example, if the starting material is a ketone and an adjacent alcohol, then under acid conditions, it could form an ether.

Wait, the starting material is 5-oxopentanoic acid with substituents. So, the structure is:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-CH2-C(O-OCH(CH2CH3)2)

Wait, not sure. Maybe it's better to think about the reaction in terms of the stereochemistry.

The product from A is (R) configuration, and from B is (S). So, the starting material A must have a certain configuration that, upon reduction, gives the R product, and starting material B gives S.

Wait, the reaction is a reduction of a carbonyl group to an alcohol. The configuration of the starting material will determine the configuration of the product.

Wait, but in the case of BH3, it's used in hydroboration reactions which typically follow anti-Markovnikov addition and have specific stereochemistry. Wait, but when BH3 is used as a reducing agent for ketones, perhaps it's part of a different reaction, like the reduction of esters or something else. Alternatively, maybe it's used in the presence of a Lewis acid, like in the Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley reduction, but I'm not certain.

Wait, LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent that can reduce ketones to secondary alcohols. BH3, on the other hand, when used with THF or another solvent, can also reduce ketones but perhaps with different stereochemical outcomes.

Wait, so perhaps the reaction is about the reduction of a ketone to an alcohol, and the configuration of the starting material determines the configuration of the product.

Wait, but the product is a cyclic ketone. So perhaps the starting material is a cyclic hemiacetal that is reduced to a diol, which then cyclizes into the product.

Alternatively, maybe the starting material is a cyclic ether with a ketone group, and the reduction leads to an alcohol that forms the product upon cyclization.

Wait, maybe I should think about the synthesis of tetrahydro pyranones. I remember that tetrahydropyrans can be formed via the acid-catalyzed cyclization of alcohols or ketones.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the starting material is an acyclic ketone with an adjacent alcohol, and upon treatment with acid, it cyclizes to form the cyclic product.

But in the problem, the starting materials are treated with LiBH4 and BH3. So, perhaps LiBH4 is reducing something, then cyclization occurs.

Wait, perhaps the starting materials are esters or other groups that can be reduced. Alternatively, maybe it's about the reduction of an ester to an alcohol, which then cyclizes.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ester, a lactone, which upon reduction gives a diol, and then cyclizes into the pyranone.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let's think about the options. All the options for A and B are the same compound but with different configurations. So, the starting materials are either the same or enantiomers.

Wait, the products are enantiomers of each other. So, the starting materials must be enantiomers as well if the same reducing agent is used. But in this case, different reducing agents are used. So, perhaps the configuration of the starting material determines the product's configuration.

Wait, when a ketone is reduced, the resulting alcohol's configuration depends on the starting material. If the ketone is prochiral, the reduction will create a new chiral center with a specific configuration.

Wait, but in the starting material, the carbonyl is at position 5. So, if the starting material is (R) or (S) configuration, the reduction would give a corresponding (R) or (S) alcohol.

But then, how does this lead to the cyclic product?

Wait, perhaps the starting material is an acyclic ketone with an adjacent hydroxyl group, and upon treatment with a reducing agent, it forms a diol, which then undergoes cyclization to form the cyclic product.

Alternatively, maybe the starting material is an ester with a carbonyl group, and the reduction forms an alcohol that cyclizes.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a pinacol rearrangement or something similar, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is an epoxide. But I think LiBH4 isn't typically used to open epoxides.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think about the stereochemistry of the product and how it relates to the starting material.

The product from A is (R)-configured, and from B is (S). So, the starting materials must each have a certain configuration that leads to the respective product.

If the starting material A is (R), and upon reduction, the product is also (R), that would suggest that the configuration is retained. But wait, in reduction reactions, the configuration of the starting material may influence the product's configuration if the alcohol forms a new chiral center.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a reduction of a ketone to an alcohol, which then undergoes an acid-catalyzed cyclization to form the cyclic product. The configuration of the starting material would determine the configuration of the alcohol, which then determines the configuration of the cyclic product.

So, if the starting material A has an (R) configuration, and upon reduction gives an (R) alcohol, which then cyclizes to form the (R) cyclic product.

Wait, but in this case, the product is a cyclic ketone. Wait, no, the product is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, which is a cyclic ketone. So, perhaps the reaction is not a reduction but an oxidation? No, because LiBH4 is a reducing agent.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Maybe the product is formed via a different mechanism. Maybe the starting material is a cyclic hemiacetal, and the reducing agent is opening it up. Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ketone with an adjacent protecting group.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to approach it from another angle. The starting materials are both 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, but with different configurations (R or S). So, the structure is a pentanoic acid with an ethyl group on carbon 3, an isobutoxy group and a ketone on carbon 5.

So, the structure is something like:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-CH2-C(O-OCH(CH2CH3)2)

Wait, no, wait. If it's 5-oxo, that would be a ketone on carbon 5. So, the structure is:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-CH2-C(O-) ?

Wait, but that would end with a carbonyl group, but then where is the isobutoxy group attached? Oh, the 5-oxo and 5-isobutoxy are on the same carbon. So the structure is:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-CH2-C(O-OCH(CH2CH2CH3)2)

Wait, that can't be right because carbon 5 would have both the ketone and the ether group. Maybe it's a geminal di-substituted carbon, which is possible but less common.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

The molecule is pentanoic acid, so five carbons in total. The first carbon is the COOH group, the second is CH2, the third is CH with an ethyl group, the fourth is CH2, and the fifth is C(O-OCH(CH2CH3)2). So, the fifth carbon has a ketone and an isobutoxy group attached. That would make it a substituted ketone.

So, the starting material has a ketone group on the fifth carbon, an isobutoxy group on the same carbon, and an ethyl group on the third carbon.

When treated with LiBH4, which is a strong reducing agent, the ketone would be reduced to a secondary alcohol. So, after reduction, the product would have a hydroxyl group on the fifth carbon.

Wait, but the product is a cyclic ketone. So, perhaps the reduction of the ketone isn't the main step. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is not a simple reduction but involves some other process.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is an ester, and the reduction leads to an alcohol that then forms a cyclic hemiacetal.

Wait, another thought: the starting material is a gamma-keto ester. When a gamma-keto ester is treated with a reducing agent, it can undergo reduction to form a diol, which can cyclize to form a cyclic hemiacetal.

Wait, but in this case, the starting material is a pentanoic acid, not an ester. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a conjugate reduction, but I'm not sure how that would apply here.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a pinacol-like coupling, but that usually involves vicinal diols.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is an alpha-keto ester, and upon reduction, it forms an alcohol which then undergoes cyclization.

But I'm not making much progress. Let me think about the product again. 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one is a six-membered ring with an oxygen and a ketone. The ethyl group is at position 4.

So, the ring likely forms by connecting the fifth carbon (where the ketone was) to the first or second carbon.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a straight-chain molecule with a ketone and an alcohol group. Upon acid treatment, it cyclizes to form the ring. But the problem states that the starting materials are treated with reducing agents, so perhaps the reaction is a reduction followed by cyclization.

Wait, if the starting material has a ketone and an adjacent hydroxyl group, then upon acid treatment, it could cyclize to form a ring. But the starting materials here are treated with LiBH4 and BH3, which are for reduction.

Wait, maybe the starting material is an ester with an adjacent ketone. When LiBH4 reduces the ester to an alcohol, perhaps leading to cyclization.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ketone with an ether substituent, but I'm not sure.

I think I'm going around in circles here. Let me try to think about the stereochemistry. The product has a specific configuration (R or S), which must come from the starting material's configuration.

If the starting material is (R), and the product is (R), that suggests that the configuration is retained during the reaction. Alternatively, the configuration could invert.

But wait, in the reduction of a ketone to an alcohol, the resulting alcohol's configuration is determined by the mechanism. For example, in a ketone reduction using a hydride agent, the hydride attacks from the less hindered side, leading to the formation of a specific configuration.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a ketone with a certain configuration, and the reduction leads to an alcohol with the same configuration. Then, during cyclization, the configuration is retained.

But how does this relate to the product being a cyclic ketone? I'm confused again.

Wait, perhaps the product is formed via an acid-catalyzed cyclization after the reduction. So, the starting material is reduced to an alcohol, which then undergoes acid-catalyzed cyclization to form the cyclic product.

In that case, the configuration of the starting material would influence the configuration of the alcohol, which in turn influences the configuration of the cyclic product.

Assuming that when the starting material A is (R), the product after reduction and cyclization is (R), and when B is (S), the product is (S).

Therefore, the starting material A must be (R) to give (R) product, and B must be (S) to give (S) product.

Looking at the options:

Option D says A is (R) and B is (S).

Option C says A is (S) and B is (R).

So, based on this reasoning, the correct option would be either C or D.

Wait, but how does the reducing agent affect the configuration?

Wait, LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent that typically reduces ketones to secondary alcohols with retention of configuration, or is it racemic? No, in the case of a prochiral ketone, the hydride would add from the less hindered side, leading to a specific configuration.

Suppose the starting material is a chiral ketone. The LiBH4 would reduce it to a secondary alcohol with a specific configuration. Then, during cyclization, the configuration would determine the product's configuration.

So, if the starting material is (R), the reduction would give an (R) alcohol, which upon cyclization gives the (R) product.

Similarly, if the starting material is (S), the reduction gives (S) alcohol, leading to (S) product.

Therefore, if reaction A uses LiBH4 and gives (R) product, the starting material A must be (R). Reaction B uses BH3 and gives (S) product, so starting material B must be (S).

Wait, but both reactions use different reducing agents. How does that affect the outcome?

Wait, LiBH4 and BH3 are both reducing agents, but they might have different selectivities or mechanisms. However, in the reduction of ketones, both would typically produce secondary alcohols, but perhaps LiBH4 is more likely to give retention of configuration, while BH3 might have some other behavior.

Alternatively, perhaps one of them is a borohydride that leads to a specific stereochemistry.

Wait, BH3 is typically a Lewis acid and is used in hydroboration reactions, which follow anti-Markovnikov and have specific stereochemistry. But when used as a reducing agent, perhaps it behaves differently.

Wait, perhaps the difference between the two reducing agents lies in the mechanism of reduction and the resulting stereochemistry. For example, BH3 could lead to a different configuration in the product than LiBH4.

Wait, another thought: maybe the starting material isn't a simple ketone but an ester or another functional group. For example, if the starting material is an ester, then LiBH4 would reduce it to a diol, which could then cyclize.

But the starting material is a pentanoic acid derivative, not an ester. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ester, a lactone. When reduced, it opens up to form a diol, which could then cyclize into the product.

But I'm not certain.

Given the time I've spent, perhaps I should make an educated guess based on the options.

The products are enantiomers, so the starting materials must be enantiomers as well. Looking at the options, option D has A as R and B as S, and option C has A as S and B as R.

Now, which reducing agent would lead to which configuration? I'm a bit confused.

Wait, perhaps the configuration of the starting material is opposite to the product because of the reduction step.

Wait, when a ketone is reduced to an alcohol, the configuration of the starting material (if it's a chiral ketone) would influence the alcohol's configuration.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a secondary alcohol, and the reaction is an oxidation, but the question states that it's a reduction.

I'm still stuck. Maybe I should consider that the starting material must be an ester, and the reduction forms an alcohol that then cyclizes to form the product.

In that case, the configuration of the starting material (ester) would determine the product's configuration.

Wait, but I'm not getting anywhere. I'll have to make a choice based on the options.

The correct starting materials are A and B with opposite configurations because the products are enantiomers. So, looking at the options, the only option where A and B are enantiomers is option D and option C.

Option D: A is R, B is S.

Option C: A is S, B is R.

So, which one is correct?

Wait, the reaction conditions are different. A is treated with LiBH4, B with BH3.

Assuming that LiBH4 and BH3 lead to opposite configurations in the product. So, if A is R and treated with LiBH4, it gives R product. B is S and treated with BH3, gives S product.

But I'm not sure about the effect of the reducing agents on the configuration.

Alternatively, perhaps LiBH4 leads to retention of configuration, while BH3 leads to inversion.

Wait, but I don't think that's accurate. Both are hydride agents and typically add the hydride to the less hindered side, leading to the same configuration.

Wait, maybe in the specific structure, the approach of the hydride would depend on the configuration of the starting material.

If the starting material is (R), the hydride would approach from the less hindered face, leading to a specific configuration in the alcohol, which then leads to a specific configuration in the product upon cyclization.

Alternatively, perhaps the opposite happens.

I think I'm stuck. Based on the options, the correct answer is either C or D.

Given that the products are enantiomers, and the starting materials are the same compound but enantiomers, the correct option would be D or C.

But without more detailed knowledge, I'll have to make an educated guess.

Wait, the correct answer is D: A is R, B is S.

Because when A is R, treated with LiBH4, it gives R product, and B being S gives S product when treated with BH3. But I'm not entirely sure.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves determining the correct starting materials for two reactions that produce enantiomeric products: (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. The reactions involve two different reducing agents, LiBH4 and BH3, acting on two unknown compounds, A and B. The starting materials are given as 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, which can exist in either (R) or (S) configurations.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Nature of the Reactions**:  
   Both LiBH4 and BH3 are reducing agents. LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent that typically reduces ketones to secondary alcohols, while BH3 can also reduce ketones but may exhibit different stereochemical outcomes depending on the reaction conditions. The starting materials are chiral, and their configurations will influence the stereochemistry of the products.

2. **Structure of the Starting Material**:  
   The starting material is 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. This compound has a ketone group at position 5, an isobutoxy group also at position 5, and an ethyl group at position 3. The stereochemistry at position 5 determines the configuration of the starting material (either (R) or (S)).

3. **Formation of the Product**:  
   The product, 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, is a six-membered cyclic ketone with an ethyl group at position 4. The stereochemistry of the product (R or S) depends on the stereochemistry of the starting material and the reduction mechanism.

4. **Stereochemical Relationship Between Starting Material and Product**:  
   The reduction of the ketone group in the starting material to an alcohol introduces a new chiral center. The configuration of this alcohol, and subsequently the configuration of the cyclic product, is determined by the configuration of the starting material. If the starting material is (R), the product will also be (R), and if the starting material is (S), the product will be (S).

5. **Role of the Reducing Agents**:  
   Both LiBH4 and BH3 reduce the ketone to an alcohol, but the stereochemical outcome may depend on the specific reducing agent and the steric environment of the starting material. However, the problem does not explicitly indicate that the reducing agents lead to different stereochemical outcomes, so the stereochemistry of the starting material is the primary factor.

6. **Options Analysis**:  
   - **Option A**: Both A and B are (S)-configured. This would produce the same product for both reactions, which contradicts the enantiomeric nature of the products.  
   - **Option B**: Both A and B are (R)-configured. Similar to Option A, this would result in the same product for both reactions, which is incorrect.  
   - **Option C**: A is (S), and B is (R). This would produce the (S) product from A and the (R) product from B, which matches the enantiomeric products.  
   - **Option D**: A is (R), and B is (S). This would produce the (R) product from A and the (S) product from B, which also matches the enantiomeric products.

7. **Conclusion**:  
   The enantiomeric nature of the products requires that the starting materials also be enantiomers. The correct pairing is A = (R) and B = (S), as this leads to the correct stereochemical outcomes for the products.

ANSWER: D
