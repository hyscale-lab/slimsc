Okay, so I have this question about stars and their photospheres, specifically about iron atoms in different energy levels. Let me try to break this down.

The problem says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. The energy difference between these levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Both photospheres are in LTE, which I remember stands for Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium. So I think that means the conditions there allow us to use the Boltzmann distribution for the energy levels.

Wait, Boltzmann distribution... Right, the probability of a particle being in an energy state is proportional to exp(-E/(k*T)), where k is Boltzmann's constant and T is the temperature. So the ratio of the populations of two energy levels would be given by the Boltzmann factor.

So let me denote the energy levels. Let's say the lower level is E1 and the upper level is E2. The ratio of the upper to lower level population would be (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k*T) ), where g's are the statistical weights. But the problem states that the atoms in star_1 are twice as excited, so maybe that's the ratio of the populations.

Wait wait, the question says the iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited as those in star_2. So for the specific energy level, perhaps the excitation is higher, meaning more atoms in a higher energy state. But I think the question is comparing the excitation in a specific energy level. Hmm, maybe the specific energy level is higher in star_1.

Wait no, maybe the ratio is between the same energy level in each star. Or perhaps it's the same level for both, but star_1 has twice as many atoms in that level as star_2.

Wait, the question says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." Hmm, so for that specific energy level, star_1 has twice the excitation. Excitation, I think, refers to the number of atoms in that energy level relative to the ground state. Or maybe it's the population of that level itself.

Alternatively, perhaps the excitation state is the fraction of atoms in a higher energy state compared to a lower one. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again.

In any case, I'll proceed with the Boltzmann factor approach. The ratio of the populations of two energy levels is given by:

n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k*T) )

In this case, the energy difference is ΔE = E2 - E1 = 1.38e-23 J. Let me assume that the ratio of the populations is 2 for star_1 compared to star_2. Wait no, the problem says that in star_1, the atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level. So maybe the ratio of the number of atoms in that level compared to the lower level is higher in star_1 than in star_2.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of atoms in that specific energy level in star_1 is twice that in star_2. So for each star, the population of that level is n1 (for star_1) and n2 (for star_2), and n1 = 2 n2.

Wait, no, wait. The problem states that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level. So perhaps the excitation level is higher. But the specific energy level's population is higher.

Alternatively, perhaps the excitation refers to the ratio of the population in that level to the lower level. Oh wait, maybe the situation is that each star has the same transition between two energy levels. So for each star, the ratio n_upper/n_lower is given by the Boltzmann factor. The problem says that in star_1, this ratio is twice that of star_2.

Wait no, the problem says that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level. Maybe it's that the ratio (n_upper/n_lower) for star_1 is twice that of star_2. So (n1_upper / n1_lower) = 2 * (n2_upper / n2_lower).

But I'm not exactly sure. Maybe the problem is simply that the population of a higher energy level is higher in star_1 than star_2, but I'm not certain. Let's think.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio of the number of excited atoms (in a specific level) is given by their respective Boltzmann factors.

So for a given energy level, the number of atoms in that level is proportional to g * exp( - E/(k T) ), where E is the energy of the level. But if the energy difference between two levels is ΔE = E2 - E1, then the ratio of their populations is n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

But in the problem, it says that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level. So perhaps for a given transition, the ratio of the upper to lower level is 2 in star_1 and 1 in star_2. Or wait, maybe the ratio is 2 for star_1 compared to star_2. So the ratio for star_1 is twice that of star_2.

Alternatively, maybe the population in a specific higher energy level is higher in star_1 than star_2. Let me think.

Wait, I think the key is that the ratio of populations (n_upper / n_lower) for star_1 is twice that of star_2. So for star_1, that ratio is 2 * (ratio for star_2). Or maybe the other way around. Let me clarify.

The problem says that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to star_2. So perhaps the number of atoms in the excited state (n_upper) in star_1 is twice that in star_2. But I'm not sure if that's the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the excitation is the ratio n_upper/(n_upper + n_lower). But that might complicate things, as it's a fraction.

Wait, perhaps the excitation is the number of atoms in a specific energy level. So for the same energy level, star_1 has twice as many as star_2. So n1 = 2 n2.

But how would that translate to the Boltzmann equation? Let me see.

Assuming that each star's photosphere is in LTE, the population of a specific energy level is given by the Boltzmann factor. So for a particular energy E, the number of atoms in that level is proportional to exp(-E/(k T)).

Wait, but different stars would have different temperatures. So for star_1, the population is proportional to exp( - E/(k T1) ), and for star_2, it's exp( - E/(k T2) ). But wait, the same energy E would be lower in one star and higher in another, affecting the exponent.

But wait, the problem states that the energy difference between the considered energy levels is 1.38e-23 J. Let me denote E_high - E_low = ΔE = 1.38e-23 J.

So the ratio of the populations for each star would be:

For star_1: n_high / n_low = (g_high / g_low) * exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

For star_2: n'_high / n'_low = (g_high / g_low) * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Given that the excitation (the ratio) for star_1 is twice that of star_2, the problem says that (n_high / n_low)_1 = 2 * (n'_high / n'_low)_2.

So (g_high / g_low) * exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 * (g_high / g_low) * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Since (g_high/g_low) is the same for both stars (same element, same transition), they cancel out.

So exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Take natural log of both sides:

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) + [ -ΔE/(k T2) ]

Multiply both sides by -1:

ΔE/(k T1) = - ln(2) + ΔE/(k T2)

Rearranging:

ΔE/(k) [ 1/T1 - 1/T2 ] = ln(2)

Wait, let me redo the algebra correctly.

Starting from:

exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Divide both sides by exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ):

exp( -ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) ) = 2

Take natural log:

-ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) = ln(2)

Factor out ΔE/(k):

ΔE/(k) [ 1/T2 - 1/T1 ] = ln(2)

So,

(ΔE/(k)) ( (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ) ) = ln(2)

Hmm, because 1/T2 - 1/T1 = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).

So,

(ΔE/(k)) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

Let me write this as:

ln(2) = (ΔE/(k)) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

Now, solving for ln(2) in terms of T1 and T2.

Wait, but the options are given in terms of ln(2) equals some function of T1 and T2.

Looking at the options:

Option D is ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

But wait, our equation has ΔE/(k) multiplied by that fraction. So unless ΔE/(k) is 1, which I don't think it is.

Wait, let me compute ΔE/(k). ΔE is 1.38e-23 J.

k is Boltzmann's constant, which is about 1.38e-23 J/K.

So ΔE/(k) = (1.38e-23 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) ) = 1 K.

Wait, that's convenient! So ΔE/(k) = 1 K.

So our equation becomes:

ln(2) = (1 K) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

So,

ln(2) = (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2)

Which is option D: ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

So the correct option is D.

The problem involves two stars in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), where the excitation of iron atoms in a specific energy level is twice as high in star_1 compared to star_2. The energy difference between the two energy levels is given as \( \Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \). Using the Boltzmann distribution, the ratio of populations of two energy levels is proportional to \( \exp(-\Delta E / (k T)) \), where \( k \) is Boltzmann's constant and \( T \) is the temperature.

For star_1 and star_2, the ratios of populations in the higher to lower energy levels are:

\[
\frac{n_{\text{high}}}{n_{\text{low}}} = \frac{g_{\text{high}}}{g_{\text{low}}} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right)
\]

Given that the excitation in star_1 is twice that of star_2, we equate:

\[
\frac{n_{\text{high}}}{n_{\text{low}}} \bigg|_{\text{star}_1} = 2 \cdot \frac{n'_{\text{high}}}{n'_{\text{low}}} \bigg|_{\text{star}_2}
\]

Canceling the statistical weights \( g_{\text{high}} / g_{\text{low}} \) (which are the same for both stars), we get:

\[
\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right) = 2 \cdot \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right)
\]

Dividing through by \( \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right) \):

\[
\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1} + \frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right) = 2
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1} + \frac{\Delta E}{k T_2} = \ln(2)
\]

Factoring out \( \Delta E / k \):

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right) = \ln(2)
\]

Rearranging:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{\Delta E}{k} \cdot \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}
\]

Substituting \( \Delta E / k = 1 \, \text{K} \) (since \( \Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \) and \( k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K} \)):

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}
\]

This matches option D. Therefore, the correct equation for the effective temperatures of the stars is:
