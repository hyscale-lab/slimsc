Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the energy required for a nucleus to reach 0.96 times the speed of light. Hmm, let me think about this. I remember from my studies that when dealing with particles moving at speeds close to the speed of light, relativistic effects come into play. 

First off, the nucleus in question is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium, right? The standard lithium nucleus is Li-7, which has 3 protons and 4 neutrons. But wait, the question says 3 neutrons. Oh, so maybe it's Li-6? Because Li-6 has 3 neutrons. So the mass number is 6, right? So the nucleus is a Li-6 nucleus, which has a mass number A=6. 

The problem is to find the energy of the RHIC such that the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96c. RHIC accelerates heavy ions, so the energy here is the kinetic energy, I think. Or is it the total energy? Wait, no, in particle physics, when they talk about the energy of a collider, they usually refer to the kinetic energy each ion has. Or maybe the total energy? Hmm, I need to clarify that. 

Wait, the energy given would be the kinetic energy, but maybe in the context of colliders, it's the total energy. No, wait, the total energy is the sum of rest mass energy and kinetic energy. But for heavy ions, the rest mass is significant, so I might need to calculate using the relativistic energy formulas.

So, the first step is to find the relativistic gamma factor. Gamma is given by 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Since v is 0.96c, let's calculate that. 

v = 0.96c, so v² = (0.96)^2 c². 0.96 squared is 0.9216. So 1 - v²/c² = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of that is sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28. So gamma is 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.5714. Wait, let me compute it accurately. 0.0784 is exactly (0.28)^2, right? Because 0.28 *0.28 is 0.0784. So yeah, so gamma is 1/0.28 = 3.57142857... approximately 3.5714.

Now, the energy of the nucleus would be gamma multiplied by the rest mass energy. The rest mass energy E_rest is m*c², where m is the rest mass of the Li-6 nucleus. 

What's the mass of Li-6? Well, the atomic mass of Li-6 is approximately 6 atomic mass units (u). Since 1 u is about 1.66053906660e-27 kg. So m = 6 * 1.66053906660e-27 kg ≈ 9.9632344e-27 kg. 

So E_rest = m*c². Let's compute that. c is approximately 3e8 m/s. So c squared is 9e16 m²/s². So E_rest = 9.963e-27 kg * 9e16 m²/s² = Let's compute that.

Wait, 9.963e-27 *9e16 is (9.963 *9) *1e-27+16 = 89.667 *1e-11 = 8.9667e-10 J. But wait, that's in joules. We need to convert that to GeV because the options are in GeV.

1 eV is 1.602e-19 joules. So to convert joules to eV, we divide by 1.602e-19. So 8.9667e-10 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV = approximately 5.6e9 eV, which is 5.6 GeV. Wait, wait, let me compute that more accurately.

E_rest = (6 u) * c². Let me calculate 6u in kg: 6 * 1.66053906660e-27 kg = 9.9632344e-27 kg. Then E_rest = 9.9632344e-27 kg * (3e8 m/s)^2.

Calculate (3e8)^2 = 9e16 m²/s².

So E_rest = 9.9632344e-27 *9e16 = 8.96691096e-10 J.

Now convert to GeV. 1 GeV is 1e9 eV. So:

8.96691096e-10 J / (1.602e-19 J/eV) = 5.6003e9 eV = 5.6003 GeV.

Wait, that's E_rest, the rest mass energy. But the question is about the energy needed for the speed to be 0.96c. So that would be the kinetic energy (K) or the total energy (E = gamma m c²)?

Wait, the question says "the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c." So the collider imparts energy to the nucleus to reach that speed. So we need to find the kinetic energy, or the total energy?

Wait, I'm a bit confused. In particle accelerators, the energy given is usually the kinetic energy. But sometimes, the term 'energy' could refer to the total energy (rest energy plus kinetic). So I need to figure out which one is correct here.

Wait, the problem says "the energy of the RHIC" so that the speed is 0.96c. So the RHIC provides the energy to accelerate the ion to that speed. So that energy would be the kinetic energy, because in accelerators, the kinetic energy is what they impart. So I need to compute the kinetic energy (K) when v=0.96c.

The formula for relativistic kinetic energy is K = (gamma - 1) m c².

So let's compute gamma again. Gamma was approximately 3.5714.

So K = (3.5714 -1) * m c² = 2.5714 * m c².

Earlier, E_rest was about 5.6003 GeV. So K = 2.5714 *5.6003 GeV.

Wait, compute that: 2.5714 *5.6003.

Hmm, let's compute 2.5714 *5.6. 2.5714 *5 is 12.857, 2.5714 *0.6 is 1.54284. So total is approx 14.4 GeV. But wait, I think I made a mistake here because gamma is 3.5714, so K is (gamma-1) * E_rest.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me compute gamma again accurately.

Gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v/c)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.96^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.9216) = 1/sqrt(0.0784) = 1/0.28 = approximately 3.57142857.

Yes, correct. So K = (gamma -1) * E_rest = (3.57142857 - 1) * 5.6003 GeV.

So 2.57142857 *5.6003 = let's compute that.

5.6003 *2 = 11.2006.

5.6003 *0.5 = 2.80015.

5.6003 *0.07142857 ≈ 5.6003 *0.07 = ~0.392, and 5.6003 *0.00142857 is about 0.008. So total approx 0.392 +0.008= 0.400.

So adding all together: 11.2006 +2.80015 =14.00075 +0.400 =14.40075 GeV.

Wait, but the options don't go that high. The options are around 18, 20, 21, 23 GeV. Hmm, that's way higher than my calculation. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the rest mass energy. Let me double-check that.

Li-6 has a mass of 6 u. 1 u is approximately 1.660539e-27 kg. So 6 u is 9.963234e-27 kg. Correct. Then E_rest is m c².

m c squared is 9.963e-27 kg * (3e8 m/s)^2 = 9.963e-27 *9e16 = 8.9667e-10 J. Then converting to GeV: 8.9667e-10 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV = 5.6 GeV. So that's correct.

Wait, but wait. Maybe I'm mixing up the rest energy and the kinetic energy. Oh wait, no, because gamma is 3.5714, so the total energy is gamma * m c² = 3.5714 *5.6 GeV ≈ 20 GeV. So the total energy is E = gamma m c², which is approximately 20 GeV.

But the question is about the energy of the collider. So in particle accelerators, the energy given to the particle is the kinetic energy. So K = E_total - E_rest = (gamma -1) * m c².

Wait, but let's compute E_total: 3.5714 *5.6 GeV is approximately 20 GeV. So E_total is about 20 GeV. So K is 20 GeV minus 5.6 GeV, which is 14.4 GeV.

But the options don't have 14 GeV. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding what the question is asking. Alternatively, perhaps the question refers to the total energy, not the kinetic energy.

Looking back at the question: "the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c?" So RHIC's energy would be the one needed to accelerate the nucleus to that speed. If the energy refers to the total energy (E = gamma m c²), then that would be around 20 GeV, which is one of the options.

Looking at the options: Option C is 20.132 GeV, D is 21.419 GeV. Hmm, let me compute gamma more accurately.

Wait, let me re-calculate gamma accurately.

v = 0.96c.

v²/c² = 0.9216.

1 - v²/c² = 0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28, so 1/0.28 = 3.57142857...

But let me compute it more precisely. 0.0784 is 784/10000, which is 196/2500. sqrt(196/2500) =14/50=0.28. So gamma is exactly 1/0.28 = 3.5714285714...

So gamma = 3.5714285714.

So E_total = gamma * E_rest.

E_rest = 5.6 GeV.

E_total = 3.57142857 *5.6.

Let me compute that more accurately.

3.57142857 *5.6:

Let me compute 3.57142857 *5 =17.85714285.

3.57142857 *0.6 = 2.14285714.

Adding them: 17.85714285 + 2.14285714 = 20 GeV.

Wait, that's exactly 20 GeV. So E_total = 20 GeV.

But earlier, when I thought E_rest was about 5.6 GeV, 3.57 *5.6 is 20, which is option C (20.132 GeV). But wait, perhaps I should compute E_rest more precisely.

Let me recompute E_rest. The rest mass energy is m c², where m is the mass of the Li-6 nucleus.

The exact mass of Li-6 is about 6.015122 u. Because the exact atomic mass of Li-6 is about 6.015122 atomic mass units. Oh! I think I made a mistake here. I assumed the mass was exactly 6 u, but in reality, the exact mass is a bit more. So I need to use the precise mass of Li-6.

Wait, yes, because the problem says X is Li with 3 neutrons, which is Li-6. The exact mass of Li-6 is 6.015122 u. So I should use that.

So m = 6.015122 u. 1 u is 1.66053906660e-27 kg.

So m = 6.015122 * 1.66053906660e-27 kg.

Calculating that:

6 *1.660539e-27 =9.963234e-27 kg.

0.015122 *1.660539e-27 = approximately 0.015122 *1.660539e-27.

0.015122 *1.660539e-27:

0.015122 *1.660539 = approx 0.025113.

So 0.025113e-27 kg = 2.5113e-29 kg.

So total m = 9.963234e-27 +2.5113e-29 = let's compute.

9.963234e-27 = 996.3234e-29.

Adding 2.5113e-29 gives 998.8347e-29 kg = 9.988347e-27 kg.

So m =9.988347e-27 kg.

So E_rest = m c².

c²=9e16 m²/s².

E_rest =9.988347e-27 kg *9e16 m²/s² = 8.9895123e-10 J.

Convert to GeV:

8.9895123e-10 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV = 5.61 GeV approximately.

Wait, precise calculation: 8.9895123e-10 / 1.602e-19.

Let me compute 8.9895123e-10 / 1.602e-19 = (8.9895123 /1.602) *1e9.

8.9895123 /1.602 ≈ 5.6095.

So 5.6095e9 eV=5.6095 GeV.

So E_rest =5.6095 GeV.

So gamma is 3.57142857.

So E_total=gamma * E_rest =3.57142857 *5.6095 GeV.

Compute that:

3.57142857 *5.6095.

Let me break it down:

3.57142857 *5 =17.85714285.

3.57142857 *0.6095 = let's compute.

0.6 = 3.57142857 *0.6 =2.142857142.

0.0095: 3.57142857 *0.0095 ≈0.03392862.

So 2.142857142 +0.03392862=2.17678576.

Adding to 17.85714285 gives 17.85714285 +2.17678576=20.0339286 GeV.

So E_total is about 20.0339 GeV.

But wait, the options are:

A)18.475 GeV

B)23.069 GeV

C)20.132 GeV

D)21.419 GeV.

So 20.0339 is closest to option C (20.132 GeV). Hmm, but wait why is there a discrepancy? Let me check my calculations again.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated gamma. Let me double-check.

v = 0.96c.

v² = (0.96c)^2 = 0.9216 c².

So 1 - v²/c² = 1 -0.9216=0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784)=0.28.

Gamma=1/0.28=3.57142857... correct.

Wait, perhaps the precise gamma is 3.57142857142857... which is exactly 25/7? Let me check: 25/7 is approximately 3.57142857.

Yes, 25 divided by 7 is 3.57142857. So gamma=25/7.

So E_total = (25/7) *5.6095 GeV.

Compute (25/7)*5.6095:

25 *5.6095 =140.2375.

Divide by 7: 140.2375 /7=20.03392857 GeV.

So approximately 20.034 GeV.

But option C is 20.132 GeV. Hmm, a bit higher. So perhaps I need to compute more accurately.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of m c².

Let me calculate m more accurately.

m =6.015122 u.

Each u is 1.66053906660e-27 kg.

So m =6.015122 * 1.66053906660e-27.

Compute 6 *1.66053906660e-27 =9.9632344e-27 kg.

0.015122 *1.66053906660e-27 = let's compute.

0.015122 *1.66053906660 = ?

0.01 *1.66053906660 =0.016605390666.

0.005122 *1.66053906660= let's compute:

1.66053906660 *0.005=0.008302695333.

1.66053906660 *0.000122= approx 0.000201859.

So 0.008302695333 +0.000201859=0.008504554.

So total 0.016605390666 +0.008504554=0.025109944666.

So 0.025109944666e-27 kg = 2.5109944666e-29 kg.

So m =9.9632344e-27 + 2.5109944666e-29.

Convert to same exponent: 9.9632344e-27 = 996.32344e-29.

So 996.32344e-29 +2.5109944666e-29=998.834434e-29 kg.

m=9.98834434e-27 kg.

E_rest =m c².

c²=9e16 m²/s².

E_rest=9.98834434e-27 kg *9e16 m²/s² = (9.98834434e-27 *9e16) = 8.989509906e-10 J.

Convert to GeV:

8.989509906e-10 J / (1.602176634e-19 J/eV) = (8.989509906e-10 / 1.602176634e-19) eV.

Compute the division: 8.989509906e-10 /1.602176634e-19 = (8.989509906 /1.602176634) *1e9.

8.989509906 /1.602176634 ≈5.6095.

Wait, let me compute 8.989509906 /1.602176634.

Approximately, 1.602176634 *5.6 = 8.97218. Close to 8.9895.

So 5.6 *1.602176634 =8.97218.

The difference is 8.9895 -8.97218 =0.01732.

So 0.01732 /1.602176634 ≈0.0108.

So approximately 5.6 +0.0108=5.6108.

So E_rest=5.6108 GeV.

So gamma is 25/7=3.57142857.

E_total =gamma * E_rest =3.57142857 *5.6108 GeV.

Compute 3.57142857 *5.6108.

Let me compute this step by step.

First, 3.57142857 *5=17.85714285.

3.57142857 *0.6=2.142857142.

3.57142857 *0.0108= approx 0.038478.

So adding up:

17.85714285 +2.142857142 =20.0.

20.0 +0.038478 =20.038478 GeV.

So approximately 20.038 GeV.

But the options don't have that. The closest is option C)20.132 GeV.

Hmm, perhaps I need to be more precise in the calculation. Let me compute gamma * E_rest precisely.

E_rest is 5.6108 GeV.

gamma =25/7 ≈3.571428571428571.

25/7 *5.6108 = (25 *5.6108) /7.

25 *5.6108 =140.27.

Divide by 7: 140.27 /7=20.0385714 GeV.

So E_total is approximately 20.0386 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is a bit higher. Hmm. So why the discrepancy? Did I make a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the exact mass of Li-6. Let me double-check. The exact mass of Li-6 isotope is about 6.015122 u.

Wait, but perhaps I should use more precise constants. For example, Planck constant, but perhaps that's not necessary here. Another thought: maybe the problem is using a different value for c, like c=3e8 m/s, which is exact, but sometimes in calculations, precise decimal points matter.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the energy is the kinetic energy, which would be (gamma -1) * m c². Let me compute that.

gamma=25/7≈3.57142857.

gamma-1=2.57142857.

E_rest=5.6108 GeV.

K=2.57142857 *5.6108 = let's compute.

2.57142857 *5 =12.85714285.

2.57142857 *0.6108= approx 1.563.

So total K=12.85714285 +1.563=14.42014285 GeV.

That's around 14.42 GeV.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps the problem is referring to the total energy, which is around 20.0386 GeV. So the closest option is C)20.132 GeV.

Wait, but my calculation for E_rest was 5.6108 GeV, gamma is 3.5714, so 3.5714 *5.6108=20.0386 GeV. So none of the options is exactly that. The option C is 20.132, which is about 0.09 GeV higher. Hmm, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the mass.

Wait, let me recalculate m c² precisely.

m =6.015122 u.

1 u =1.66053906660e-27 kg.

So m =6.015122 *1.66053906660e-27 = ?

Compute 6.015122 ×1.66053906660e-27.

Let me compute this multiplication precisely.

6 *1.66053906660e-27 =9.9632344e-27 kg.

0.015122 ×1.66053906660e-27 = ?

0.01 ×1.66053906660e-27 =1.66053906660e-29.

0.005122 ×1.66053906660e-27 = ?

0.005 ×1.66053906660e-27 =8.302695333e-30.

0.000122 ×1.66053906660e-27=2.020602060e-31.

Adding all:

1.6605390666e-29 +8.302695333e-30 = 2.4908085999e-29.

Plus 2.02060206e-31 =2.4908085999e-29 +0.0202060206e-29=2.5110146205e-29.

So m =9.9632344e-27 +2.5110146205e-29 = 9.9632344e-27 +0.025110146205e-27 =9.9883445462e-27 kg.

So E_rest =m c² =9.9883445462e-27 kg ×9e16 m²/s² =8.98950999158e-10 J.

Convert to GeV: 8.98950999158e-10 /1.602176634e-19 = (8.98950999158 /1.602176634) *1e9.

Calculate 8.98950999158 /1.602176634:

Let me compute 1.602176634 ×5.6 = ?

5 ×1.602176634=8.01088317.

0.6 ×1.602176634=0.96130598.

So 8.01088317+0.96130598=8.97218915.

Which is less than 8.98950999.

The difference is 8.98950999 -8.97218915=0.01732084.

Now, 0.01732084 ÷1.602176634 ≈0.010807.

So total is 5.6 +0.010807=5.610807 GeV.

So E_rest is approximately 5.610807 GeV.

Now, E_total = gamma * E_rest = (25/7) *5.610807.

Which is (25 *5.610807)/7.

25 *5.610807 =140.270175.

Divide by 7: 140.270175 /7 =20.0385964 GeV.

So E_total is 20.0385964 GeV.

The options are:

A)18.475 GeV

B)23.069 GeV

C)20.132 GeV

D)21.419 GeV.

So 20.0386 GeV is closest to option C (20.132 GeV), but it's not exactly matching. Hmm, perhaps the calculation expects the energy to be the kinetic energy.

Wait, let me compute the kinetic energy.

K = (gamma -1) * E_rest.

gamma=25/7=3.57142857.

gamma-1=2.57142857.

E_rest=5.610807 GeV.

So K=2.57142857 *5.610807.

Calculating:

2.57142857 ×5.610807.

Let me compute 2.57142857 ×5 =12.85714285.

2.57142857 ×0.610807.

Compute 2.57142857 ×0.6 =1.54285714.

2.57142857 ×0.010807 ≈0.02777.

So sum is 1.54285714 +0.02777=1.57062714.

Adding to 12.85714285 gives 14.42776999 GeV.

So K≈14.4278 GeV.

But none of the options are close to this. So perhaps the question is referring to the total energy, which is around 20.0386 GeV.

Looking at the options, none is exactly that, but option C is 20.132 GeV. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the gamma calculation. Let me make sure. Let me compute gamma again.

v=0.96c.

gamma=1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) =1/sqrt(1-0.96^2)=1/sqrt(1-0.9216)=1/sqrt(0.0784)=1/0.28=3.57142857.

Wait, perhaps the precise value of gamma is higher. Let me compute 0.0784 accurately.

No, I think that's correct. 0.96 squared is 0.9216, so 1-0.9216 is 0.0784. Square root of 0.0784 is 0.28 exactly, so gamma is exactly 1/0.28=3.57142857.

Hmm, perhaps the problem expects the total energy, which is approximately 20.0386 GeV. But option C is 20.132 GeV. There's a difference of about 0.09 GeV, which is about 90 MeV. That's significant. Did I make a mistake in the mass?

Wait, perhaps I should consider the exact value of the atomic mass of Li-6. Let me check the exact value.

The exact mass of Li-6 isotope is 6.015122 u. So I think I used the correct value.

Wait, perhaps the problem counts energy as the total energy, and I have to account for more precise gamma. Or perhaps I should compute gamma more accurately.

Wait, let me compute sqrt(0.0784) precisely.

Wait, 0.0784 is 784/10000.

sqrt(784)=28, sqrt(10000)=100. So sqrt(784/10000)=28/100=0.28.

So gamma is exactly 3.57142857. So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the question is using a different speed? No, the question states 0.96c.

Hmm, perhaps I should consider that the question expects the kinetic energy, but in that case, the answer doesn't match any of the options. So I'm a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the problem is using a different value for the speed of light, like c=3e8 m/s exactly, but that shouldn't affect the calculation beyond the decimal points.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of E_rest. Let me try that again.

E_rest = m c².

m=6.015122 u.

1 u =1.66053906660e-27 kg.

m=6.015122 * 1.66053906660e-27 = ?

Let me compute 6 *1.66053906660e-27 =9.9632344e-27 kg.

0.015122 *1.6605390666e-27:

0.01 *1.6605390666e-27 =1.6605390666e-29 kg.

0.005122 *1.6605390666e-27 = let's compute.

0.005 *1.6605390666e-27 =8.302695333e-30 kg.

0.000122 *1.6605390666e-27 =2.02060206e-31 kg.

So sum for 0.005122: 8.302695333e-30 +2.02060206e-31=8.504757539e-30 kg.

Now, 0.015122 part: 1.6605390666e-29 +8.504757539e-30 = (1.6605390666 +0.8504757539) e-29 =2.5110148205e-29 kg.

So m=9.9632344e-27 +2.5110148205e-29.

Convert to same exponent:

9.9632344e-27 =996.32344e-29.

Add 2.5110148205e-29: 996.32344 +2.5110148205=998.8344548205e-29 kg.

So m=9.988344548205e-27 kg.

E_rest= m c²=9.988344548205e-27 kg ×9e16 m²/s².

Compute:

9.988344548205e-27 ×9e16 =8.98950999338e-10 J.

Convert to GeV:

8.98950999338e-10 J /1.602176634e-19 J/eV = (8.98950999338 /1.602176634) *1e9.

Compute 8.98950999338 /1.602176634.

Let me do this division precisely.

1.602176634 ×5.6 =8.97218915.

The remainder is 8.98950999338 -8.97218915=0.01732084338.

Now, 0.01732084338 /1.602176634 ≈0.01081.

So total is 5.6 +0.01081=5.61081 GeV.

So E_rest=5.61081 GeV.

So E_total = gamma * E_rest =3.57142857 *5.61081.

3.57142857 ×5.61081.

Let me compute 3.57142857 ×5 =17.85714285.

3.57142857 ×0.61081=?

0.6 ×3.57142857=2.142857142.

0.01081 ×3.57142857=approx 0.038583.

So sum is 2.142857142 +0.038583=2.181440142.

Adding to 17.85714285:17.85714285 +2.181440142=20.038583 GeV.

So E_total≈20.038583 GeV.

Looking at the options again, the closest is option C)20.132 GeV.

Hmm, but that's still a discrepancy. Did I miss something? Wait, perhaps the problem uses the rest energy in a different way. Oh! Wait, perhaps the RHIC accelerates the ions to a certain kinetic energy, but the question is about the total energy. Or perhaps the problem is considering the kinetic energy. Let me check what RHIC's energy refers to.

Upon recalling, RHIC accelerates heavy ions to high energies, and the energy given is the kinetic energy. So if the question is about the kinetic energy, then K= E_total -E_rest =20.038583 GeV -5.61081 GeV ≈14.42777 GeV. But this isn't any of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the total energy, which is approximately 20.0386 GeV. But the options don't have that. So perhaps I made an error in calculating E_rest.

Wait, perhaps I should use the exact value of the speed of light, not an approximation. For precise calculations, c=299,792,458 m/s.

Let me recalculate E_rest using c=299792458 m/s.

But that would make the calculation much more precise, but perhaps the difference is negligible. Let me try.

E_rest = m c².

m=9.988344548205e-27 kg.

c=299792458 m/s.

c²=(299792458)^2 =8.987551787e16 m²/s².

So E_rest =9.988344548205e-27 kg ×8.987551787e16 m²/s².

Compute this: 9.988344548205e-27 *8.987551787e16 = (9.988344548205 *8.987551787) *1e-11.

Compute 9.988344548205 *8.987551787 ≈90.730 GeV? Wait, no, wait, 9.988 *9=89.892, but precise calculation:

9.988344548205 *8.987551787.

Let me compute:

Approximate 9.9883445 *8.9875518.

= (10 -0.0116555) * (9 -0.0124482).

But perhaps a better approach is to compute 9.9883445 *8.9875518.

= (approx) 9 *9=81, 9*0.9875518=8.888..., 0.9883445 *9=8.8951, 0.9883445 *0.9875518≈0.976.

Wait, perhaps this is getting too complicated. Let me use a calculator-like approach.

9.9883445 ×8.9875518.

Multiply 9.9883445 by 8.9875518.

= (10 -0.0116555) * (9 -0.0124482)

= 10*9 -10*0.0124482 -0.0116555*9 +0.0116555*0.0124482.

=90 -0.124482 -0.1048995 +0.0001454.

=90 - (0.124482 +0.1048995) +0.0001454.

=90 -0.2293815 +0.0001454.

=89.7707639.

So 89.7707639 ×1e-11 =8.97707639e-10 J.

Wait, no, wait: 9.9883445e-27 kg *8.987551787e16 m²/s² = (9.9883445e-27 *8.987551787e16) = (9.9883445 *8.987551787)e-11.

Which is 89.7707639e-11 J=8.97707639e-10 J.

Convert to GeV: 8.97707639e-10 J /1.602176634e-19 J/eV = (8.97707639 /1.602176634) *1e9.

8.97707639 /1.602176634 ≈5.603.

So E_rest=5.603 GeV.

So E_total =gamma * E_rest=3.57142857 *5.603 ≈3.57142857 *5.603.

3.57142857 *5=17.85714285.

3.57142857 *0.603= approx 2.153.

So 17.85714285 +2.153=20.0101 GeV.

So E_total≈20.01 GeV.

Still, none of the options match exactly. So perhaps the correct answer is option C)20.132 GeV. But why the discrepancy?

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the exact value of the Li-6 mass is 6.015122 u, and compute E_rest with more precision.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the usage of the formula for kinetic energy, which is (gamma -1) m c².

Wait, let me compute that.

K=(gamma-1) m c².

gamma=3.57142857.

gamma-1=2.57142857.

E_rest=5.6108 GeV.

So K=2.57142857 *5.6108 ≈14.427 GeV.

But again, that's not any of the options.

Wait, perhaps the problem is referring to the total energy, and the options have a typo. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of gamma.

Wait, let me compute gamma again using v=0.96c.

v=0.96c.

gamma=1/sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) =1/sqrt(0.0784)=1/0.28=3.57142857.

Yes, that's correct.

Hmm, perhaps I should look for another approach. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the total energy using the formula E=gamma m c², and if the answer isn't an option, perhaps I made a mistake in the mass.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the nucleus is not Li-6 but Li-7. Because sometimes, in problems, Li refers to Li-7, which has 3 neutrons (since Li-7 has 3 protons and 4 neutrons, but wait, that would be 4 neutrons. Wait, no, the problem states X is Li with 3 neutrons. So Li-6 (3 protons, 3 neutrons) is correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses a different value for the atomic mass. For example, maybe the mass is 6.941 u for Li, but that's for Li-7. Hmm, no, the problem states 3 neutrons, so it's Li-6.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of E_rest. Let me compute E_rest using the exact value.

E_rest = m c².

m=6.015122 u.

1 u =1.66053906660e-27 kg.

So m =6.015122 *1.66053906660e-27 kg.

Compute 6 ×1.66053906660e-27 =9.9632344e-27.

0.015122 ×1.66053906660e-27 =?

0.01 ×1.66053906660e-27 =1.66053906660e-29.

0.005122 ×1.66053906660e-27 = ?

0.005 ×1.66053906660e-27 =8.302695333e-30.

0.000122 ×1.66053906660e-27 =2.02060206e-31.

Adding: 1.6605390666e-29 +8.302695333e-30 +2.02060206e-31.

=1.6605390666e-29 +0.8302695333e-29 +0.0202060206e-29.

= (1.6605390666 +0.8302695333 +0.0202060206) e-29.

=2.5110146205e-29 kg.

So m=9.9632344e-27 +2.5110146205e-29 = 9.9632344e-27 +0.025110146205e-27 =9.9883445462e-27 kg.

E_rest=9.9883445462e-27 kg × (299792458 m/s)^2.

=9.9883445462e-27 ×8.987551787e16 m²/s².

=8.98950999e-10 J.

Convert to GeV: 8.98950999e-10 J /1.602176634e-19 J/eV =5.6108 GeV.

So E_rest=5.6108 GeV.

E_total=gamma *E_rest=3.57142857 ×5.6108≈20.0386 GeV.

Which again, doesn't match exactly any option. But the closest is option C (20.132 GeV). However, another possibility is that the problem expects the energy in TeV, but that seems unlikely as the options are in GeV.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem considers the rest mass energy as the sum of protons and neutrons, but that's a more involved calculation. But since the problem states it's a Li nucleus with 3 neutrons, which is Li-6, I think the approach is correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a different value for c, like c=3e8 m/s.

Let me compute E_rest using c=3e8 m/s.

c=3e8 m/s.

c²=9e16 m²/s².

E_rest= m c²=9.9883445462e-27 kg ×9e16 m²/s²=8.98950999e-10 J.

Convert to GeV: 8.98950999e-10 J /1.602176634e-19 J/eV=5.6108 GeV.

Same as before.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation of gamma.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the formula for gamma is incorrect. Let me recheck.

v=0.96c.

gamma=1/sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)) =1/sqrt(1 -0.96²) =1/sqrt(1-0.9216) =1/sqrt(0.0784)=1/0.28=3.57142857.

Yes.

Hmm, maybe the problem expects the answer rounded to three decimal places, but none of the options match.

Alternatively, perhaps the question asks for the kinetic energy, but the options don't include it. But the options are all around 20 GeV except option A which is 18.475 GeV.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the mass. Let me check the exact atomic weight of Li-6.

Upon checking, the exact mass is approximately 6.015122 u. So that's correct.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is option C)20.132 GeV, but I'm not seeing why the calculation isn't matching. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the use of a different gamma value.

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma using more precise calculations.

Let me compute gamma accurately.

v=0.96c.

gamma =1/sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) =1/sqrt(0.0784)=1/0.28=3.57142857.

Yes, that's correct to many decimal places.

So, unless I'm missing a key factor, I think the correct energy is approximately 20.0386 GeV, which isn't one of the options. But the closest option is C)20.132 GeV.

Wait, perhaps the problem rounds to three decimal places, but my calculation is 20.0386 GeV. So perhaps the intended answer is option C)20.132 GeV, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of E_rest.

Wait, perhaps I should use the exact value of the speed of light in the calculation.

Let me compute E_rest using c=299792458 m/s.

m=6.015122 u =6.015122 ×1.66053906660e-27 kg =9.9883445462e-27 kg.

E_rest = m c² =9.9883445462e-27 kg × (299792458)^2 m²/s².

Compute (299792458)^2 = 8.987551787e16 m²/s².

So E_rest =9.9883445462e-27 ×8.987551787e16 = (9.9883445462 ×8.987551787) ×1e-11.

Compute 9.9883445462 ×8.987551787.

Approximate: 10 ×9=90, so 9.9883445462 ×8.987551787 ≈89.77.

So 89.77 ×1e-11 =8.977e-10 J.

Convert to GeV: 8.977e-10 /1.602176634e-19 =5.603 GeV.

So E_rest=5.603 GeV.

E_total=gamma *E_rest=3.57142857 ×5.603≈20.038 GeV.

Same result as before.

Hmm, perhaps the intended answer is option C)20.132 GeV, but I'm not seeing a way to reach that value. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the calculation to use the rest mass as 6 u, leading to E_rest=5.6 GeV, giving E_total=20 GeV, which is close to option C.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of gamma.

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma using more precise decimal points.

v=0.96c.

gamma =1/sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) =1/sqrt(0.0784)=1/0.28=3.571428571428571...

So with more decimal places, it's 3.571428571428571...

So E_total =3.571428571428571 ×5.6108.

Compute 3.571428571428571 ×5.6108.

3.571428571428571 ×5=17.857142857142855.

3.571428571428571 ×0.6108= ?

Compute 3.571428571428571 ×0.6=2.142857142857142.

3.571428571428571 ×0.0108=0.03847826086956522.

Sum: 2.142857142857142 +0.03847826086956522=2.181335403726707.

So E_total=17.857142857142855 +2.181335403726707=20.03847826086956 GeV.

So E_total≈20.0385 GeV.

Still, doesn't match any option exactly. So perhaps the intended answer is option C)20.132 GeV, but I'm not seeing how to reach that. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the answer to be 20 GeV, which is close to option C.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the rest energy. Let me check once more.

E_rest =6.015122 u * c².

But wait, perhaps the problem uses the rest mass energy in MeV, not GeV? No, because the options are in GeV.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Based on the calculations, the correct energy is approximately 20.0385 GeV. The closest option is C)20.132 GeV. But I'm not sure why there's a discrepancy. Perhaps I made a mistake in the mass or in the speed. Alternatively, perhaps the intended answer is option C, and the precise calculation leads to that.

But looking at the options again, I'm thinking that perhaps the correct answer is option C)20.132 GeV, but my calculation says 20.0386 GeV. The difference is about 0.09 GeV, which could be due to more precise constants or a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the use of the relativistic kinetic energy formula, but that leads to 14.42 GeV, which isn't an option.

Wait, perhaps there's confusion between total energy and kinetic energy. If the problem asks for the kinetic energy, but the options are higher, then perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the question refers to the center-of-mass energy, but that's more complex and I don't think it's the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is wrong, or the options are incorrect.

But given the options, the closest to my calculation is option C)20.132 GeV.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) required to accelerate a Li-6 nucleus to a speed of \( v = 0.96c \), we use relativistic energy equations. The Li-6 nucleus has a mass of \( 6.015122 \, \text{u} \), where \( 1 \, \text{u} = 1.66053906660 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg} \). The rest mass energy (\( E_{\text{rest}} \)) is calculated as:

\[
E_{\text{rest}} = m c^2 = (6.015122 \, \text{u}) \cdot (3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s})^2
\]

Substituting \( 1 \, \text{u} = 1.66053906660 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg} \), the rest mass energy is:

\[
E_{\text{rest}} \approx 5.6108 \, \text{GeV}.
\]

The relativistic gamma factor (\( \gamma \)) is calculated using:

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.96)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.0784}} \approx 3.5714.
\]

The total energy (\( E_{\text{total}} \)) is then:

\[
E_{\text{total}} = \gamma \cdot E_{\text{rest}} = 3.5714 \cdot 5.6108 \approx 20.0386 \, \text{GeV}.
\]

The problem asks for the energy of the RHIC, which typically refers to the total energy imparted to the nucleus. Among the given options:

- **A) 18.475 GeV**: Too low compared to the calculated value.
- **B) 23.069 GeV**: Significantly higher than the calculated value.
- **C) 20.132 GeV**: Closest to the calculated value of \( 20.0386 \, \text{GeV} \).
- **D) 21.419 GeV**: Higher than the calculated value.

The calculated total energy (\( 20.0386 \, \text{GeV} \)) is closest to option **C) 20.132 GeV**. The slight discrepancy may arise from rounding or approximations in constants used during the calculation.

**Answer: C**
