Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to visualize it first.

The setup is an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R, and there's a small spherical cavity inside it. The center of the cavity is a distance s away from the center of the conductor, and the radius of the cavity is r, which is smaller than R. So the cavity isn't touching the outer surface of the conductor; it's entirely inside.

Now, a small positive charge +q is placed inside this cavity. The question is about finding the electric field at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor, and the distance from the center of the cavity to P is l. Also, l and L are both greater than R, so P is definitely outside the conductor. The angle between l and s is theta.

Hmm, okay. I remember that conductors have some interesting properties regarding electric fields and charges. Since the conductor is uncharged, it initially has no net charge, but when a charge is placed inside the cavity, things change.

Wait, the conductor is a conductor, so the charges inside must influence the charges on the inner and outer surfaces. Oh right, when a charge is placed inside a cavity of a conductor, the inner surface of the conductor will have an induced charge equal in magnitude but opposite in sign. So if there's +q inside, the inner surface of the conductor (the cavity's inner wall) will have -q. But wait, the conductor itself is neutral overall. So the outer surface must have a charge equal to +q to balance the inner surface's -q. Because the total conductor is neutral, the sum of inner and outer charges must be zero. So inner is -q, so outer is +q.

But wait, no, the conductor as a whole is uncharged. So the cavity has a charge +q. The inner surface must have an induced charge of -q, and the outer surface will have +q to make the total zero. Because the conductor's total charge is zero, so inner (-q) plus outer (+q) gives zero.

But wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The conductor is neutral. The charge inside the cavity is +q. The cavity is inside the conductor, so the inner surface must have an induced charge of -q. Since the conductor is neutral, the outer surface must have +q to balance the inner -q.

Wait, no. Wait, the conductor is neutral. The cavity has a charge +q. The inner surface of the conductor (cavity's inner wall) must have an induced charge of -q. Then, the outer surface must have a charge of +q to make the total zero. So the conductor's net charge is zero, as the inner is -q and outer is +q, summing to zero.

So the outer surface has a charge of +q.

Now, the point P is outside the conductor. So the electric field at P will be due to the charges on the outer surface of the conductor, right? Because the inner charges are screened by the conductor's material.

Wait, but in this case, the conductor's outer surface has a charge of +q. So the electric field at any point outside the conductor should be the same as if all that charge were concentrated at the center. Because the conductor is a spherical shell, and the electric field outside a spherical shell of charge is as if all the charge were at the center.

So at point P, the electric field would be given by Coulomb's law, E = (1/(4πε₀)) * (q) / L², where L is the distance from the center of the conductor to P.

Wait, let me think again. Because the conductor is a sphere, the charges on the outer surface distribute themselves uniformly, right? So the electric field outside would be as if the charge were a point charge at the center. So yes, the electric field at P is determined by the total charge on the conductor's outer surface, which is +q, and the distance from the center to P is L.

So looking at the options, option B is (1/(4πε₀)) * q/(L²). That seems right.

But wait, the problem says the center of the cavity is separated by s from the center. The point P's distance from the cavity's center is l, and the angle between l and s is theta. So why are these factors involved? Maybe the charge distribution isn't uniform, but I think for a conductor, even if the cavity is off-center, the outer surface would still have a uniform charge distribution? Or wait, no. If the cavity is off-center, the charge distribution on the inner surface would be non-uniform, but the outer surface would adjust to make sure that the external field is as if the charge is at the center.

Wait, I'm getting a bit mixed up. Let me think again. The conductor is initially neutral. When a charge +q is placed inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor (cavity's inner wall) will have an induced charge of -q, regardless of where the +q is placed inside the cavity. The conductor's outer surface must have +q to balance the inner -q.

Now, because the conductor is a conductor, the charges on the outer surface will distribute themselves uniformly, provided the conductor is a sphere. Wait, but in this setup, the conductor is a sphere, but the cavity is not at the center. So the inner surface of the conductor is a shell, but if the cavity is offset, the inner surface charge might not be uniform. But wait, no, the charge distribution on the inner surface would depend on the shape of the cavity. Wait, but in a conductor, the charges on the inner surface will arrange themselves to cancel the electric field inside the conductor. Because the conductor is a conductor, the electric field inside it must be zero.

So the inner surface's charge distribution must exactly cancel the electric field due to the +q charge. So if the +q is placed off-center, the inner surface's charge would be non-uniform, but the outer surface's charge would still be uniform? Or not? Wait, no. Because the conductor is neutral overall, the outer surface will have a charge of +q, but its distribution depends on whether the conductor is a perfect sphere or not.

Wait, the conductor is a spherical conductor, so the outer surface would have a uniform charge distribution only if it's a perfect sphere. But the cavity is inside, so as long as the conductor is spherical, the outer surface would have a uniform distribution regardless of where the inner charge is placed.

Wait, no. The charge on the outer surface of a spherical conductor is uniformly distributed, regardless of the internal charges, as long as the conductor is a perfect sphere. Because the external field must be as if all the charge were at the center.

So regardless of where the charge is placed inside the cavity (even if the cavity is not at the center), the outer surface's charge distribution remains uniform, and the electric field outside the conductor is the same as if the charge were at the center.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think of it another way. The conductor is a sphere, so the outer surface is a sphere. The charge on a spherical shell conductor distributes uniformly regardless of any charges inside the enclosed space. So the presence of any charges inside (even if the cavity is shifted) would cause the inner surface to have induced charges, but the outer surface would still have a uniform distribution.

Wait, no, that's not correct. If the conductor is a sphere, and the cavity is shifted, the inner surface's charge distribution would be non-uniform, but the outer surface's charge distribution remains uniform because the conductor is a sphere. Because the outer surface is a spherical shell, any charge on it will distribute uniformly, regardless of the inner charge distribution.

Wait, but the conductor is a sphere, so the outer surface is a sphere. So yes, any charge on it would be uniformly distributed, so the electric field outside would be as though all the charge were at the center.

So, in this case, the outer surface has a charge +q, and the field at P is E = (1/(4πε₀))*(q)/(L²).

Looking back at the options, option B is E = (1/(4πε₀)) q/(L²), which matches.

But wait, let me think again. The point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor. The distance from the cavity's center to P is l, with an angle theta between l and s (the distance between the centers of the conductor and cavity).

Hmm, does this affect the electric field? Because the charge q is inside the cavity, which is off-center. So the field at P is due to the outer surface's charge, which is +q. So the field should be the same as if the charge were at the center of the conductor, regardless of the position of the cavity.

Because the conductor's outer surface is a sphere, the field outside should only depend on the distance from the center of the conductor, not the cavity.

So the correct answer should be option B.

The setup involves an uncharged spherical conductor of radius $R$ with a small spherical cavity inside. The cavity is offset from the center of the conductor by a distance $s$, and its radius is $r < R$. A small positive charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity. The goal is to determine the electric field $\vec{E}$ at a point $P$ outside the conductor, located at a distance $L$ from the center of the conductor. The distance from the center of the cavity to $P$ is $l$, and the angle between $l$ and $s$ is $\theta$.

Key points to consider:

1. **Charge Distribution on the Conductor**:  
   - The conductor is initially neutral. When the charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor (cavity's inner wall) induces a charge of $-q$ to cancel the electric field within the conductor.  
   - To maintain the conductor's neutrality, the outer surface of the conductor must have a charge of $+q$ to balance the $-q$ on the inner surface.

2. **Electric Field Outside the Conductor**:  
   - The outer surface of the conductor is a spherical shell with uniform charge distribution, regardless of the position of the cavity or the charge $+q$ inside.  
   - For a spherical shell, the electric field outside the shell is as if all the charge were concentrated at the center of the sphere.  
   - At point $P$, which is outside the conductor, the electric field is determined by the total charge on the outer surface ($+q$) and the distance $L$ from the center of the conductor to $P$.

3. **Relevance of $l$, $s$, and $\theta$**:  
   - The distance $l$ from the cavity's center to $P$, the offset $s$ between the centers of the conductor and the cavity, and the angle $\theta$ between $l$ and $s$ do not affect the electric field at $P$.  
   - The field outside the conductor depends only on the charge on the outer surface and the distance $L$ from the center of the conductor, due to the spherical symmetry of the outer surface.

4. **Correct Option**:  
   - The electric field at $P$ is given by Coulomb's law:  
     $$E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}.$$  
   - This matches option **B**.
