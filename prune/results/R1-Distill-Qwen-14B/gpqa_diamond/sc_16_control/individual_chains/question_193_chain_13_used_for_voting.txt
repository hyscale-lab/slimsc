Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand it.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over parallax to the fifth power, right? So the number of stars, N, is proportional to 1/plx^5. And the question is asking about how the number of stars changes with distance (per unit range of distance). So, how does N change as the distance r increases?

Hmm. I remember that parallax is related to distance. Wait, parallax is inversely proportional to distance. Oh right, the formula is plx = 1/distance (in parsecs), so distance d = 1/plx. So if parallax increases, distance decreases, and vice versa.

So the number of stars N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5. Let me write that down: N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. But since plx is 1/d, maybe I can express everything in terms of d.

Replacing plx in the equation: N ∝ 1/( (1/d) )^5. Let's compute that. 1/(1/d)^5 is the same as d^5. So N is proportional to d^5. So the number of stars increases with the fifth power of distance.

Wait, but the question isn't directly about N versus d. It's about how N changes with distance, per unit range of distance. So I think they're asking for the rate of change of N with respect to d. Like, how N varies as you move from one distance to another a little bit further.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. So N is proportional to d^5. So if I take the derivative of N with d, dN/dd would be proportional to 5d^4. But wait, does that mean the change in N per unit distance is proportional to d^4?

But the question is asking, "how does the number of stars... change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)." Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe it's just about the dependence, not the derivative.

Wait, let me clarify. If N is proportional to d^5, then as d increases, N increases as d^5. So per unit change in r (which is distance), how does N change? Hmm, I think the key is to express N in terms of r and see how it scales.

Wait, but wait, the number of stars observed depends on both the volume (which goes as r^3, because volume is 4/3 π r³) and perhaps other factors like density. Oh, but in this problem, it's given that N varies as 1/plx^5. So maybe I don't need to consider the general case, but just proceed with the given relation.

So, plx = 1/d. So 1/plx^5 = d^5. So N ∝ d^5. So as distance r (same as d) increases, N increases as r^5. So the number of stars increases with the fifth power of the distance.

But the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance. Wait, perhaps it's asking about the differential change. So the change in N per unit change in r would be dN/dr. Since N is proportional to r^5, dN/dr would be proportional to 5r^4.

Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see an option with r^4. Wait, no, option C is r^4, so that's an option. But wait, let me make sure.

Wait, let's think again. The number of stars is proportional to d^5. So for a small change in d, say delta d, the change in N would be proportional to 5d^4 delta d. So the change per unit distance (delta d =1) would be proportional to d^4. That would imply that the rate of change of N with distance is proportional to r^4. So the number of stars increases with r^5, but the rate of change with respect to r is r^4.

Wait, but the question is phrased: "how does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?" Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps it's asking for the dependence of N on r, which is r^5. But the options include r^5 as option B.

Wait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the question. The question says the number of stars varies as 1/plx^5. So N is proportional to (1/plx)^5. But plx = 1/d, so N is proportional to d^5. So as d increases, N increases as d^5. So the number of stars in a region varies as the fifth power of the distance. So per unit distance, how does it change? Or perhaps the problem is about the number of stars per unit volume, but I'm not so sure.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model the number of stars as a function of distance. Let me think about how N depends on distance. Since N ∝ d^5, then for a small range of distance, say from d to d + delta d, the number of stars would be proportional to (d + delta d)^5 - d^5. But for small delta d, this is approximately 5d^4 delta d. So the number of stars per unit distance (delta d) is proportional to d^4. So the number of stars in a thin shell at distance d would be proportional to d^4 * delta d.

Wait, but the question is phrased as "how does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)." Hmm, perhaps the region's size is such that as you go further, you're considering a larger volume. But if the number of stars is increasing as d^5, then for each unit of distance, the increase would be 5d^4. But perhaps the question is simply asking about the dependence of N on d, which is d^5.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The question states that N varies as 1/plx^5. Since plx is 1/d, N is proportional to d^5. So as the distance d (r) increases, N increases as d^5. So the number of stars in that region is proportional to r^5. So per unit distance, perhaps it's the density, but I'm not sure.

Looking at the options, option B is ~ r^5. So that's probably the answer.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. Suppose that I increase the distance by a small amount. How much does N change? If N is proportional to r^5, then the change in N (dN) is the derivative (dN/dr) times dr. So dN/dr is 5r^4. But the question is about how N changes with distance, per unit distance. So the change per unit r would be ~ r^4. So that would correspond to option C.

Hmm. Now I'm getting a bit stuck. Which is it? The question says, "how does the number of stars... change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?" So maybe they're asking for the slope of N as a function of r, which would be the derivative, dN/dr. If N is proportional to r^5, then dN/dr is 5r^4. So the change per unit distance is proportional to r^4.

So the correct answer would be option C, ~ r^4.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Because another approach is to consider the volume. The number of stars in a given volume depends on the volume and the stellar density. Normally, the number of stars would increase with volume, which is r^3, but if the stellar density (stars per unit volume) is increasing, then the product could have higher dependence.

But in this problem, the given relation is N ∝ 1/plx^5, which translates to N ∝ d^5. So the volume is proportional to d^3, but perhaps the density is increasing as d^2, because N is d^5 = (d^3) * (d^2). So the density is proportional to d^2.

But the question is about how N changes with distance per unit range. So if N is proportional to d^5, then the change in N per unit d is d^4.

So the correct option would be C) ~ r^4.

Wait, but I'm getting conflicting thoughts here. Let me try to write down the equations step by step.

Given: N ∝ (1/plx)^5
But plx = 1/d, so 1/plx = d. So N ∝ d^5.

So N = k * d^5, where k is a constant.

Now, the question is about how N changes with distance, per unit range of r. So dN/dr = 5k d^4.

So the change in N per unit change in r is proportional to d^4. So the answer should be option C.

But wait, the options are A) r^3, B) r^5, C) r^4, D) r^2.

So the correct answer would be C) r^4.

The problem states that the number of stars, \( N \), in a specific region of the sky varies with parallax as \( N \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}}^5 \). Parallax (\( \text{plx} \)) is inversely proportional to distance (\( d \)), such that \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \). Substituting this into the given relation, \( N \propto d^5 \). This means the number of stars increases with the fifth power of distance.

The question asks how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance (\( r \)). To determine this, we calculate the derivative of \( N \) with respect to \( r \), which gives the rate of change of \( N \) per unit distance. Since \( N \propto d^5 \), the derivative is:

\[
\frac{dN}{dr} \propto 5d^4
\]

Thus, the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance as \( r^4 \). Among the given options, the correct answer is:

**C) \( \sim r^4 \)**.
