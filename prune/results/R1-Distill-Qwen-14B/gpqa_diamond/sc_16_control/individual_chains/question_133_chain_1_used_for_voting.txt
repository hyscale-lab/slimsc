Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because buffer solutions can be tricky, but let's take it step by step. The question is about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution containing KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. Hmm, I remember that these are related to phosphate buffer systems.

First, I need to figure out what's going on here. The solution has two different phosphate salts. KH2PO4 is potassium hydrogen phosphate, and Na2HPO4·2H2O is sodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate, I think. Both are related to the phosphate ion, HPO4^2-.

Wait, orthophosphate is H3PO4, right? But I might be getting confused. Let me think. Phosphate can exist in different forms based on the pH. The different K_a values come into play here. The problem gives Ka1, Ka2, Ka3 for H3PO4 as 7.5e-3, 6.2e-8, 1.8e-12. So the first deprotonation is H3PO4 → H2PO4^- + H+. The second is H2PO4^- → HPO4^2- + H+, and the third is HPO4^2- → PO4^3- + H+.

Wait, but in this solution, we have KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. So, I think that these two salts will dissociate into their respective ions. Let me write that out.

KH2PO4 dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^-.
Na2HPO4·2H2O would dissociate into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- (since the formula is Na2HPO4, so 2 Na+ per HPO4^2-).

So, the solution contains H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- ions. Since we have both, this is a buffer solution, right? Because a buffer is made of a weak acid and its conjugate base, or a weak base and its conjugate acid. Here, H2PO4^- can act as an acid (donating a proton to become HPO4^2-) or as a base (accepting a proton to become H3PO4). But in this case, since we have both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, the buffer is between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Wait, but the question is about the concentration of orthophosphate ions. Orthophosphate is H3PO4, right? Or wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Orthophosphoric acid is H3PO4. When it loses a proton, it becomes H2PO4^- (dihydrogen phosphate), then HPO4^2- (hydrogen phosphate), and then PO4^3- (phosphate). So orthophosphate is H3PO4. But in the solution, we have H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-. Does that mean any H3PO4 is present? Probably not, because we're adding the salts, which are the conjugate base and the deprotonated forms.

Wait, but the question is about orthophosphate ions. Or is it orthophosphate meaning the HPO4^2- ion? Hmm, no, I think orthophosphate refers to H3PO4. So maybe I need to find the concentration of H3PO4 in solution. But if we have a buffer solution of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, then the H3PO4 concentration would be very low, because it's the first form. Unless there's some reaction happening.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the concentration of HPO4^2- ions. Hmm, the question says "orthophosphate ions." I'm a bit confused about terminology. Let me think: orthophosphate is H3PO4. But in solution, it's not stable as the acid; it dissociates. So in a solution with H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, the orthophosphate (H3PO4) would be minimal. Wait, but maybe the question is phrased differently. Or perhaps I need to calculate the concentration of HPO4^2-.

Wait, the problem statement says: "what is the concentration of orthophosphate ions". Orthophosphate ions would be HPO4^2-, I think. Because H3PO4 is the neutral molecule, orthophosphoric acid, but in solution, it's in its ionized forms. So perhaps, HPO4^2- is the orthophosphate ion.

Alternatively, sometimes people refer to HPO4^2- as the orthophosphate ion. I'm a bit confused about the terminology here. Let me check my notes or textbook concepts. Oh wait, in the context of the phosphate buffer system, there are different species, and orthophosphate usually refers to the HPO4^2- species. Or maybe the phosphate ion is PO4^3-? Wait, no, phosphate ion is PO4^3-. So, HPO4^2- would be hydrogen phosphate, or maybe the orthophosphate ion. Hmm, I'm not entirely sure, but perhaps the question is asking for the concentration of HPO4^2-.

Wait, but the problem gives the Ka values, which are for H3PO4. So, the first deprotonation is the acid form. So, if we have H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, that's a buffer between H2PO4^- (acid) and HPO4^2- (base). So, the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation applies here.

Wait, but the problem is asking for the concentration of orthophosphate ions. So, unless orthophosphate refers to HPO4^2-, which is the form in Na2HPO4, then the concentration would be the sum of HPO4^2- from both salts. Or, perhaps because the solution is buffered, the concentration of HPO4^2- can be determined using the H-H equation.

Wait, but the options are all in the 1e-7 range, so it's probably not a straightforward sum. Maybe I'm missing something here.

Wait, let me try to think again. So the problem is about the concentration of orthophosphate ions. Orthophosphate is H3PO4, but that is not the case here because the solution contains H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Wait, perhaps the question is actually referring to the concentration of the phosphate ion, which would be PO4^3-. But that's probably not, because PO4^3- is very soluble and would be the conjugate base of HPO4^2-.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's approach it step by step.

First, I need to calculate the concentrations of the two salts in the solution.

The solution's volume is 200.00 cm³, which is 0.2 liters.

The salts are:

1.00 g of KH2PO4 (MW 136.09 g/mol)
1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O (MW 177.99 g/mol)

First, let's find the moles of each.

Moles of KH2PO4: mass / MW = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol ≈ 0.007335 mol

Moles of Na2HPO4·2H2O: 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol ≈ 0.005610 mol

So, the solution has 0.007335 moles of H2PO4^- and 0.005610 moles of HPO4^2-.

Wait, but these are in 0.2 L, so concentrations would be:

[H2PO4^-] = 0.007335 / 0.2 ≈ 0.036675 M
[HPO4^2-] = 0.005610 / 0.2 ≈ 0.02805 M

Now, the buffer solution consists of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-. The pH of the solution can be found using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.

The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid])

Here, the acid is H2PO4^- (since it can donate a proton to become HPO4^2-), and the base is HPO4^2-.

Wait, the relevant pKa is Ka2, because H2PO4^- → HPO4^2- + H+. Ka2 is given as 6.2e-8, so pKa2 is log(6.2e-8) ≈ 7.209.

Wait, let me calculate that more accurately. Ka2 is 6.2×10^-8. So pKa = -log(6.2e-8).

Log(6.2) is about 0.7924, so log(6.2e-8) is 0.7924 -8 = -7.2076. So pKa2 is 7.2076.

So, pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-])

Plugging in the concentrations:

[HPO4^2-] ≈ 0.02805 M
[H2PO4^-] ≈ 0.036675 M

So [base]/[acid] = 0.02805 / 0.036675 ≈ 0.765

Log(0.765) is approximately -0.115, so pH ≈ 7.2076 - 0.115 ≈ 7.0926.

Wait, but how does this help me find the orthophosphate concentration?

Wait, the question is about the concentration of orthophosphate ions. If orthophosphate is H3PO4, then I need to find [H3PO4]. But in this buffer solution, H3PO4 would be minimal, because it's a weak acid that's mostly deprotonated. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question and the orthophosphate ions are the HPO4^2-.

Wait, perhaps the question is actually asking for the concentration of PO4^3-, but that's unlikely because that's a much stronger base and would be less in concentration.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is trying to trick me into using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the HPO4^2- concentration, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the solution is a buffer, and in solution, the phosphate can exist in various forms. The problem is to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which is HPO4^2-.

Wait, but we already have the moles of HPO4^2- from Na2HPO4·2H2O. But wait, no, because the solution is a buffer, and the HPO4^2- can come from the dissociation of H2PO4^-.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think again.

In a solution containing H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, the concentration of H3PO4 would be very low because it's a weak acid. But the problem is asking for orthophosphate ions, which I think refers to HPO4^2-.

Wait, but the HPO4^2- comes from two sources: the Na2HPO4·2H2O and the dissociation of H2PO4^-.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The initial moles of H2PO4^- are 0.007335 mol, and the initial moles of HPO4^2- are 0.005610 mol. But in solution, some of the H2PO4^- may dissociate into HPO4^2- and H+. Similarly, some of the HPO4^2- may accept a proton to form H2PO4^-.

But since we're dealing with a buffer, the ratio of HPO4^2- to H2PO4^- is determined by the pH, which we calculated as approximately 7.0926.

Wait, but if the solution has these two concentrations, then the HPO4^2- concentration is what we have from the salts plus any formed from the dissociation of H2PO4^-.

Wait, no, the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is based on the ratio of the concentrations of the conjugate base (HPO4^2-) and the acid (H2PO4^-). So, in this case, the HPO4^2- comes from the salt and any that comes from the dissociation of H2PO4^-. But since the H2PO4^- is the acid, its concentration is higher than the conjugate base.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model this using the equilibrium.

The reaction is H2PO4^- ↔ HPO4^2- + H+.

Ka2 is 6.2e-8.

The initial concentrations are [H2PO4^-] = 0.036675 M, [HPO4^2-] = 0.02805 M.

Let me denote the change as x: H2PO4^- dissociates by x, so HPO4^2- increases by x, and H+ increases by x.

Wait, but the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation already gives us the pH, which is based on the ratio. Wait, but perhaps the actual concentrations of HPO4^2- is higher than initial due to dissociation.

Alternatively, perhaps the total concentration of phosphate species is the sum of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- and any other forms.

Wait, but maybe the problem is expecting me to calculate the concentration of HPO4^2- using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.

Wait, let me think again. The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]).

We calculated pH as approximately 7.0926.

But wait, the problem gives the temperature as 25°C, so the K_a values are as given.

So, pKa2 is approximately 7.209.

So, pH = 7.209 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-])

We found that log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-]) is about -0.115, which gives pH ≈7.0926.

But how does this help us find [HPO4^2-]?

Wait, perhaps I need to find the ratio between [HPO4^2-] and [H2PO4^-], and then express both in terms of the total concentration.

Alternatively, since the solution is a buffer, the concentration of orthophosphate ions (HPO4^2-) can be found using the ratio.

Wait, but the initial concentrations are 0.036675 M H2PO4^- and 0.02805 M HPO4^2-. So, perhaps the ratio is 0.02805 / 0.036675 ≈ 0.765. Which would mean that [HPO4^2-] is about 0.765 times [H2PO4^-].

But how does that relate to the actual concentrations in solution?

Wait, perhaps I'm getting stuck here. Let me think of another approach. Since the buffer equation relates the ratio, perhaps I can express [HPO4^2-] in terms of [H2PO4^-].

Wait, but the problem is asking for the concentration of orthophosphate ions. If that's HPO4^2-, then the concentration is 0.02805 M, but that's the initial concentration before considering any dissociation. But in the buffer, some H2PO4^- will dissociate into HPO4^2-.

Wait, but that would increase [HPO4^2-], which may not be correct because the buffer equation already considers the equilibrium.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the concentration of orthophosphate (HPO4^2-) is just the concentration coming from the dissociation of H2PO4^- and the added Na2HPO4.

Wait, but that's a bit circular. Alternatively, perhaps the orthophosphate is in equilibrium with H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Wait, another angle: the total phosphate concentration is the sum of all phosphate species. But in this case, since the buffer is between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, the major species are these two, and the contribution of H3PO4 and PO4^3- is negligible.

Wait, but the problem is asking for the concentration of orthophosphate ions. Let me think again about the terminology. I've found that orthophosphate refers to H3PO4, which is the fully protonated form. But in solution, particularly in buffer solutions, H3PO4 is not present in significant amounts because it's a weak acid and tends to lose protons.

So, the concentration of H3PO4 (orthophosphate) would be very low. Hmm, but how can I calculate that?

Because H3PO4 can donate a proton to become H2PO4^-, the equilibrium is H3PO4 <-> H+ + H2PO4^-.

The K_a1 is 7.5e-3, which is approximately 0.0075. So, pKa1 is about 2.12.

But wait, the buffer's pH is around 7.09, which is much higher than pKa1. In such a solution, H3PO4 would be very minimal, because the pH is way higher than pKa1, meaning the solution is not acidic enough to have significant amounts of H3PO4.

But how much is it? Let's try to compute it.

The concentration of H3PO4 can be found using the first dissociation equation.

Ka1 = [H+][H2PO4^-]/[H3PO4]

We can rearrange to find [H3PO4] = [H+][H2PO4^-] / Ka1

We know the pH is approximately 7.09, so [H+] = 10^-pH ≈ 10^-7.09 ≈ 8.21e-8 M.

[H2PO4^-] is about 0.036675 M.

Ka1 is 7.5e-3.

So, [H3PO4] = (8.21e-8) * (0.036675) / (7.5e-3)

Let me calculate that.

First, numerator: 8.21e-8 * 0.036675 ≈ 3.01e-9.

Divide by 7.5e-3: 3.01e-9 / 7.5e-3 ≈ 4.01e-7 M.

So, [H3PO4] ≈ 4.01e-7 M.

Wait, but looking at the options, option D is 3.97e-7, which is close to this value. Hmm, but let me check the calculations again.

Wait, let me recalculate the pH more accurately.

Ka2 is 6.2e-8, so pKa2 is log(6.2e-8) = log(6.2) + log(1e-8) = 0.7924 -8 = -7.2076, so pKa2 is 7.2076.

The ratio [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] is (0.02805)/(0.036675) ≈ 0.765.

So, log(0.765) is approximately log(0.75) is -0.1249, but more accurately, let's compute it.

Using log(0.765): 

We know that log(0.7) ≈ -0.1549, log(0.76) is about log(7.6e-1) = log(7.6) + log(1e-1) )= 0.8808 -1 = -0.1192.

Alternatively, perhaps a better way is to compute log(0.765):

Using natural logarithm approximation: ln(0.765) ≈ -0.268.

But to convert to log base 10: ln(x) = 2.3026 log(x). So, log(0.765) = ln(0.765)/2.3026 ≈ (-0.268)/2.3026 ≈ -0.1164.

So, pH = pKa2 + log(ratio) = 7.2076 + (-0.1164) ≈ 7.0912.

So [H+] = 10^(-7.0912) ≈ 8.20e-8 M.

Now, [H3PO4] = [H+][H2PO4^-] / Ka1.

[H2PO4^-] is 0.036675 M.

So, numerator: 8.20e-8 * 0.036675 ≈ 3.01e-9.

Divide by Ka1 (7.5e-3): 3.01e-9 / 7.5e-3 = 4.01e-7 M.

So [H3PO4] is approximately 4.01e-7 M. Looking at the options, option D is 3.97e-7, which is very close.

Wait, perhaps I made a slight approximation. Let me recalculate with more precise values.

Computing [H+] precisely: pH =7.0912 → [H+] = 10^(-7.0912) = approximately 8.21e-8 M.

[H2PO4^-] = 0.036675 M.

Ka1 =7.5e-3.

So [H3PO4] = (8.21e-8) * (0.036675) / 7.5e-3.

Compute numerator: 8.21e-8 * 0.036675 = let's compute 8.21 * 3.6675 = approx 30.23, so 3.023e-8.

Wait, 8.21e-8 * 0.036675 → 8.21 * 0.036675 = let's compute that: 8 *0.036675 is 0.2934, 0.21 *0.036675 is approx 0.00770175. So total is 0.2934 + 0.00770175 = 0.30110175. So 0.30110175e-8 → 3.0110175e-9.

Divide by 7.5e-3: 3.0110175e-9 / 7.5e-3 = (3.0110175 /7.5) * 1e-6.

3.0110175 /7.5 ≈ 0.401469.

So, 0.401469e-6 → 4.01469e-7 M.

Which is approximately 4.01e-7 M, which rounds to 4.01e-7. The option D is 3.97e-7, which is very close. Perhaps more precise calculation would get closer to that.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the exact concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- considering the buffer equation, but I think the approach is correct.

So the correct answer would be approximately 4.0e-7 M, which is option D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions (H₃PO₄) in the solution, we analyze the buffer system formed by KH₂PO₄ and Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O. The dissociation of these salts introduces H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻ ions into the solution, forming a buffer between H₂PO₄⁻ (acid) and HPO₄²⁻ (base). The relevant equilibrium for calculating the concentration of H₃PO₄ involves the first dissociation of H₃PO₄:

\[
\text{H₃PO₄} \leftrightharpoons \text{H⁺} + \text{H₂PO₄⁻}
\]

The equilibrium constant for this reaction is \( K_{a1} = 7.5 \times 10^{-3} \), and the pH of the solution is calculated using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{p}K_{a2} + \log\left(\frac{[\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}{[\text{H₂PO₄⁻}]}\right)
\]

Here, \( K_{a2} = 6.2 \times 10^{-8} \), so \( \text{p}K_{a2} = -\log(6.2 \times 10^{-8}) \approx 7.2076 \). The concentrations of H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻ are determined from the given masses of the salts:

- Moles of KH₂PO₄:  
  \[
  \frac{1.00 \, \text{g}}{136.09 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.007335 \, \text{mol}
  \]  
  Molarity:  
  \[
  [\text{H₂PO₄⁻}] = \frac{0.007335}{0.2 \, \text{L}} \approx 0.036675 \, \text{M}
  \]

- Moles of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O:  
  \[
  \frac{1.00 \, \text{g}}{177.99 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.005610 \, \text{mol}
  \]  
  Molarity:  
  \[
  [\text{HPO₄²⁻}] = \frac{0.005610}{0.2 \, \text{L}} \approx 0.02805 \, \text{M}
  \]

The ratio of \([\text{HPO₄²⁻}]\) to \([\text{H₂PO₄⁻}]\) is:  
\[
\frac{[\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}{[\text{H₂PO₄⁻}]} = \frac{0.02805}{0.036675} \approx 0.765
\]

Substituting into the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:  
\[
\text{pH} = 7.2076 + \log(0.765) \approx 7.2076 - 0.1164 \approx 7.0912
\]

The hydrogen ion concentration is:  
\[
[\text{H⁺}] = 10^{-\text{pH}} \approx 10^{-7.0912} \approx 8.21 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{M}
\]

Using the equilibrium expression for the first dissociation of H₃PO₄:  
\[
K_{a1} = \frac{[\text{H⁺}][\text{H₂PO₄⁻}]}{[\text{H₃PO₄}]}
\]

Rearranging to solve for \([\text{H₃PO₄}]\):  
\[
[\text{H₃PO₄}] = \frac{[\text{H⁺}][\text{H₂PO₄⁻}]}{K_{a1}}
\]

Substituting the values:  
\[
[\text{H₃PO₄}] = \frac{(8.21 \times 10^{-8})(0.036675)}{7.5 \times 10^{-3}} \approx \frac{3.02 \times 10^{-9}}{7.5 \times 10^{-3}} \approx 4.03 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

This value is closest to option D (\(3.97 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}\)), considering slight approximations in calculations.
