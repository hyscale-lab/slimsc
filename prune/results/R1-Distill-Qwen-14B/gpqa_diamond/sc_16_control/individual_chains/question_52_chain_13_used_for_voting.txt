Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem, and I'm a bit new to this, so let me see what I can do. The question is about the ratio of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels when a star has spots versus when it doesn't. Hmm, I remember that when stars have dark spots, their overall temperature changes, which affects the spectra. 

The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and 1.1 solar masses. Without spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. When 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the effective temperature drops to 5500 K. Wait, but why does the overall temperature decrease? Oh, because the spots are cooler than the surrounding photosphere, so when a significant portion is covered, the average Teff goes down.

The question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels, level 1 and level 2. The ratio decreases when the star has spots. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes—basically, what's the factor when no spots are present compared to when spots are present.

I remember that in LTE (Local Thermal Equilibrium), the number of atoms in different energy levels is given by the Boltzmann equation. The ratio (n1/n2) is proportional to (g1/g2) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k*T) ), where g is the statistical weight and E is the energy difference. 

Wait, the problem says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when the star has spots, the effective temperature is lower (5500 K instead of 6000 K). Let me think about how temperature affects the ratio.

If the ratio is (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), where ΔE is E2 - E1. So when T decreases, the exponent becomes more negative, meaning exp(...) becomes smaller. Thus, n1/n2 decreases with lower T, which matches the observation that the ratio decreases when spots are present.

We need to find (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_with_spots.

Each ratio is (g1/g2) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) ). Let's call the ratio R. So R_no_spots = (g1/g2) * exp(−ΔE/(k T_no)), and R_with_spots = (g1/g2) * exp(−ΔE/(k T_with)). 

The ratio of R_no to R_with is [exp(−ΔE/(k T_no)) ] / [exp(−ΔE/(k T_with)) ].

That simplifies to exp( ΔE/(k) (1/(T_with) - 1/(T_no)) ). 

Wait, let me compute that exponent. Because when you divide exponents with the same base, you subtract the exponents. So, it's exp( [ -ΔE/(k T_no) ) + ΔE/(k T_with) ] ), which is the same as exp( ΔE/(k) ( 1/(T_with) - 1/(T_no) ) ).

Wait, ΔE is E2 - E1, so positive. So if T_with is lower than T_no, then 1/T_with is higher than 1/T_no, so the exponent is positive. So exp(positive) is greater than 1, meaning R_no / R_with is greater than 1. The ratio of R_no to R_with is the factor by which the ratio changes.

Now, the transition corresponds to a wavelength of 1448 Å. Oh, right, the energy of a photon is E = hc/λ. So ΔE = hc/λ.

Let me plug in the numbers. Let me compute ΔE in terms of k*T, since the temperatures are in K.

First, compute hc/λ. h is Planck's constant, c is speed of light.

h = 6.626e-34 J·s
c = 3e8 m/s
λ = 1448 Å = 1448e-10 m = 1.448e-7 m.

So E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1.448e-7) = let's compute that.

6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m
Divide by 1.448e-7 m: 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 = approx 1.373e-18 J.

Now, k is Boltzmann's constant, 1.38e-23 J/K.

So ΔE / (k) = (1.373e-18 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) ) ≈ 9.956e4 K.

Wait, 1e5 K approximately. Let me compute more accurately:

1.373 /1.38 ≈ 0.995, so about 0.995e5 K. So approximately 99500 K.

So ΔE/(k) ≈ 99500 K.

Now, compute 1/(T_with) - 1/(T_no). T_with is 5500 K, T_no is 6000 K.

1/5500 ≈ 0.000181818
1/6000 ≈ 0.000166667
Subtracting: 0.000181818 - 0.000166667 = 0.000015151 per K.

So (1/T_with - 1/T_no) = 0.000015151 1/K.

Multiply by ΔE/(k): 99500 * 0.000015151 = let's compute that.

99500 * 0.000015151 = 99500 * 1.5151e-5.

Calculate 99500 * 1.5151e-5 = 99500 * 0.000015151.

99500 * 0.00001 = 0.995
99500 * 0.000005151 = approx 99500 * 5.151e-6 = approx 0.5113.

Sum: 0.995 + 0.5113 ≈ 1.5063.

So the exponent is approximately 1.5063.

So the factor is exp(1.5063) ≈ e^1.5063.

We know that e^1 is about 2.718, e^1.6 is about 4.953. 1.506 is about halfway between 1.5 and 1.6.

Wait, e^1.5 is about 4.4817, e^1.5063 is a bit higher. Let's compute it more accurately.

Compute 1.5063: let me think, e^1.5 is 4.4817, e^0.0063 is about 1.00634 (since ln(1.0063) ≈ 0.0063). So 4.4817 * 1.0063 ≈ 4.4817 * 1.0063 ≈ about 4.509.

Wait, that can't be right because e^1.5063 is about 4.5 something. Wait, but I'm thinking that the exponent is positive, so the ratio R_no / R_with is about 4.5.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations.

Wait, ΔE/(k) was approximately 99500 K. Let me recalculate that.

E = hc/(λ) = (6.626e-34 J s)(3e8 m/s) / (1.448e-7 m) = (6.626e-34 *3e8)/(1.448e-7)

Compute numerator: 6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J m.

Divide by 1.448e-7 m: 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 = (1.9878 / 1.448) * 1e-18.

1.9878 /1.448 ≈ 1.373.

So 1.373e-18 J.

k is 1.38e-23 J/K.

So ΔE/(k) = (1.373e-18) / (1.38e-23) ) = (1.373 / 1.38) * 1e5 K.

1.373/1.38 ≈ 0.995, so 0.995e5 K = 99500 K. That part is correct.

Then, 1/T_with = 1/5500 ≈ 0.000181818, 1/T_no=1/6000≈0.000166667. Their difference is 0.000015151.

Multiply by 99500: 99500 * 0.000015151.

Let me compute that:

99500 = 1e5 - 500. 1e5 * 0.000015151 = 1.5151. 500 * 0.000015151 = 0.0075755. So 1.5151 - 0.0075755 = 1.5075.

Wait, no: 99500 is 99500 = 100,000 - 500.

So 99500 * 0.000015151 = 100,000 * 0.000015151 - 500 * 0.000015151.

Which is 1.5151 - 0.0075755 = 1.5075245.

So the exponent is approximately 1.5075.

So exp(1.5075) is what?

I remember that ln(4.5) is about 1.504. Because ln(4)=1.386, ln(4.5) is a bit higher. Let me check:

e^1.5 is about 4.4817. e^1.5075 is a bit more. Let me compute it.

Approximate using Taylor series or known values.

We can compute e^x where x=1.5075.

We know that e^1.504 = 4.5 (since ln(4.5) ≈ 1.5040774). So e^1.5075 is a bit higher than 4.5. Let's compute the difference.

The difference between 1.5075 and 1.5040774 is about 0.0034226.

So, using the approximation e^a ≈ e^b * e^(a-b), where a = 1.5075 and b=1.5040774.

So e^(0.0034226) ≈ 1 + 0.0034226 + (0.0034226)^2/2 + ... 

Let me compute it:

0.0034226 is about 0.00342.

e^0.00342 ≈ 1 + 0.00342 + (0.00342)^2/2.

0.00342 squared is about 1.169e-5, divided by 2 is 5.845e-6.

So e^0.00342 ≈ 1.00342 + 0.000005845 ≈ 1.0034258.

So e^1.5075 ≈ 4.5 * 1.0034258 ≈ 4.515366.

So approximately 4.515.

Wait, but the options are B) ~7.8, C) ~4.5, D) ~2.9.

So the factor is approximately 4.5, which would be option C.

Wait, but let me double-check if I got the ratio correct. The ratio R_no / R_with is (n1/n2 without spots)/(n1/n2 with spots) = e^(ΔE/(k) (1/T_with - 1/T_no))).

Which is e^(99500 * (0.000015151)) ) ≈ e^1.5075 ≈ 4.5.

Yes, that's right. So the factor is about 4.5. So the answer is C.

To determine the factor by which the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots, we use the Boltzmann equation in LTE. The ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels is given by:

\[
\frac{n_1}{n_2} \propto \frac{g_1}{g_2} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right),
\]

where \(g_1\) and \(g_2\) are the statistical weights, \(\Delta E = E_2 - E_1\) is the energy difference, \(k\) is Boltzmann's constant, and \(T\) is the temperature. The factor by which the ratio changes is:

\[
\frac{\left(\frac{n_1}{n_2}\right)_{\text{no spots}}}{\left(\frac{n_1}{n_2}\right)_{\text{with spots}}} = \exp\left(\Delta E \cdot \frac{1}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_{\text{with}}} - \frac{1}{T_{\text{no}}}\right)\right).
\]

### Step 1: Compute \(\Delta E / k\)
The energy difference \(\Delta E\) corresponds to the transition wavelength \(\lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å}\). Using \(E = \frac{hc}{\lambda}\), where \(h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}\), \(c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}\), and \(\lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å} = 1.448 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m}\), we find:

\[
E = \frac{6.626 \times 10^{-34} \cdot 3 \times 10^8}{1.448 \times 10^{-7}} \approx 1.373 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J}.
\]

Dividing by \(k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K}\), we get:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} = \frac{1.373 \times 10^{-18}}{1.38 \times 10^{-23}} \approx 99500 \, \text{K}.
\]

### Step 2: Compute the temperature term
The effective temperatures are \(T_{\text{no}} = 6000 \, \text{K}\) (without spots) and \(T_{\text{with}} = 5500 \, \text{K}\) (with spots). The term \(\frac{1}{T_{\text{with}}} - \frac{1}{T_{\text{no}}}\) is:

\[
\frac{1}{5500} - \frac{1}{6000} \approx 0.000181818 - 0.000166667 = 0.000015151 \, \text{K}^{-1}.
\]

### Step 3: Compute the exponent
Multiplying \(\Delta E / k\) by the temperature term:

\[
\Delta E \cdot \frac{1}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_{\text{with}}} - \frac{1}{T_{\text{no}}}\right) = 99500 \cdot 0.000015151 \approx 1.5075.
\]

Thus, the factor is:

\[
\exp(1.5075) \approx 4.515.
\]

### Step 4: Match with the options
The closest option to the computed factor is **C) ~4.5**.
