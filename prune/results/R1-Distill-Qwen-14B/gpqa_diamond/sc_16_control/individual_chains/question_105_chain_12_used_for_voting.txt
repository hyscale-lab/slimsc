Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Let me read it carefully and try to figure out what's going on. Hmm, the question is about a star and some spots on it, and how that affects the brightness observations, which can look similar to an exoplanet transit. The goal is to find the radius of a hypothetical planet that would produce the same brightness variation as the spots do.

Alright, the star has a radius equal to the Sun's. So Rstar is like R_sun. One hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%. The star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are 1000K cooler. So spots are at 5000K. Since only one hemisphere is spotty, when the star rotates, the spots come into view and then go away. This makes the star's brightness change over time, which is what they're observing.

The interesting part is that this brightness variation can resemble an exoplanet transit. So if the star wasn't spotted, how big would a planet need to be to cause the same change in brightness?

Wait, so the problem is asking for the planet radius relative to the star's radius (Rpl/Rstar) such that the light curve's amplitude is the same as what the spots produce.

I think I need to calculate the fractional change in brightness caused by the spots and then set that equal to the fractional change caused by a planet transit, then solve for Rpl.

Let me break it down. The variation in brightness when spots are present is due to the spots being cooler. So when the spots are facing us, they make the star appear dimmer. The variation in brightness would depend on the area of the spots and their temperature difference.

First, the star's total brightness, or luminosity, without any spots is L0 = 4πRstar²σTeff⁴. But when spots are present, part of the star's surface is cooler. The total observed flux will decrease when the spots are in view.

The filling factor is 20% (0.2), which is the fraction of the hemisphere covered by spots. But wait, the problem says one hemisphere is covered. So the total area of the spots is 0.2 multiplied by the area of a hemisphere.

Wait, wait, the star's surface area is 4πR². A hemisphere would be 2πR². So the area covered by spots is 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR².

But the star is a sphere, so when it's observed, the area that affects the overall brightness is the area that's visible. Wait, but since the spots are on one hemisphere, when the star rotates, that hemisphere comes into view and then goes away. So the maximum effect would be when the entire spotted hemisphere is visible, and the minimum when it's not.

Wait, but the problem says that the star has one hemisphere covered with spots, and the photometric observations show variations as the star rotates. So the brightness variation is due to the spots being visible or not, as the star's rotation brings them into view.

So when the spots are visible, the observed flux is lower because the spots are cooler.

The key is to compute the change in flux when the spots are transiting (or rather, when they are in view). So the flux without any spots is F0 = σTeff⁴. The flux with the spots would be F = F0 * (1 - (A * (T_spot^4 - T_star^4)/(T_star^4)) )) ?

Wait, maybe I should think about the contribution of the spots versus the rest of the star.

The star's total flux is the sum of the flux from the unspotted regions and the spotted regions.

Let me denote:

- A = area of the star's surface (4πR²).

But wait, the spots are on a hemisphere, so the area of the hemisphere is 2πR². The filling factor is 0.2, so the area of the spots is 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR².

The unspotted area on that hemisphere is 2πR² - 0.4πR² = 1.6πR². And the other hemisphere has no spots, so that's another 2πR² of area.

So when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the total area of the star we see is 2πR² (the spotted hemisphere) plus the other hemisphere's 2πR². So the unspotted hemisphere doesn't change; only the spotted one's flux changes as it rotates.

Wait, no. When the star rotates, we see the spotted hemisphere and the unspotted one. Wait, no, each hemisphere is either facing us or not. So when the star is viewed such that the spotty hemisphere is visible, we see all the spots. When it's rotated 180 degrees, the unspotty hemisphere is visible, so no spots are seen.

Wait, but the filling factor is 0.2 in the hemisphere. So the area of the spots is 0.2 * (2πR²) = 0.4πR².

The flux from the star when the spotty hemisphere is visible:

Flux = (Flux from unspotted regions) + (Flux from spotted regions).

The unspotted regions on the spotty hemisphere: area = 2πR² - 0.4πR² = 1.6πR². So their flux is (1.6πR²) * σ(Teff)^4.

The spotted regions: area 0.4πR², flux is (0.4πR²) * σ(T_spot)^4.

The other hemisphere, which is unspotted: area 2πR², flux is (2πR²) * σ(Teff)^4.

Wait, but that's not correct because when the spotty hemisphere is facing us, the other hemisphere is on the back side and not visible. So the total flux when the spotty hemisphere is visible is the flux from the spotty hemisphere's unspotted parts plus the flux from the unspotty hemisphere.

Wait, no, the unspotty hemisphere is the other side. So when the star is viewed with the spotty hemisphere in front, the flux is:

Flux_spotty = (unspotted area of spotty hemisphere) * σ(Teff^4) + (spotted area) * σ(T_spot^4) + (unspotty hemisphere) * σ(Teff^4).

Wait, no. No, the unspotty hemisphere is the other side, which is entirely unspotted. So when the star's spotty hemisphere is facing us, the total flux is the sum of the unspotted parts of that hemisphere and the entire unspotty hemisphere.

So the total flux is:

Flux = (1.6π R² * σ Teff^4) + (2π R² * σ Teff^4) + (0.4π R² * σ T_spot^4 )

Wait, but wait, the spotty hemisphere's unspotted area is 1.6π R², and the unspotty hemisphere is 2π R². The spotted area is 0.4π R².

So adding those up, the total flux when the spotty side is visible would be:

Flux_spotty = [1.6π R² * Teff^4 + 2π R² * Teff^4 + 0.4π R² * T_spot^4 ] * σ

Because σ is a constant, it can be factored out.

So combining terms:

Flux_spotty = [ (1.6 + 2) π R² Teff^4 + 0.4 π R² T_spot^4 ] * σ

= [3.6 π R² Teff^4 + 0.4 π R² T_spot^4 ] * σ

Factor out 0.4 π R²:

= 0.4 π R² [9 Teff^4 + T_spot^4 ] * σ

Wait, 3.6 is 0.4 * 9? Because 0.4 *9 = 3.6. Yes, because 3.6 = 0.4 * 9. So 3.6 = 0.4 *9, so 3.6 π R² Teff^4 = 0.4 π R² * 9 Teff^4. Then adding 0.4 π R² T_spot^4 gives 0.4 π R² (9 Teff^4 + T_spot^4).

Hmm, but when the star is not showing the spotty hemisphere, the flux is when the unspotty hemisphere is visible. Wait, the unspotty hemisphere is the other side. So when the other side is visible, the spotty hemisphere is on the back, so we don't see any spots. So the flux in that case is:

Flux_unspotty = 2π R² * Teff^4 * σ + 2π R² * Teff^4 * σ ?

Wait no, no. The star's total area is 4π R². When the unspotty hemisphere is visible, the front side is the unspotty hemisphere, which has an area of 2π R². The back is the spotty hemisphere, but we can't see it. So the flux is:

Flux_unspotty = 2π R² * Teff^4 * σ + (spotted area on the back is not visible, so we don't include it).

Wait no, the unspotty hemisphere is entirely at Teff. So when the unspotty side is facing us, the flux is:

Flux_unspotty = 2π R² * Teff^4 * σ

Wait, but when the spotty hemisphere is facing us, the flux is:

Flux_spotty = [ (unspotted area on spotty hemisphere) * Teff^4 + (spotted area) * T_spot^4 ] * σ + (unspotty hemisphere) * Teff^4 * σ

Wait, no. No, because when the spotty hemisphere is facing us, the other hemisphere is the unspotty one, which is the back and not visible. So the visible area is the spotty hemisphere, which is 2π R². So the flux is:

Flux_spotty = (unspotted area of spotty hemisphere) * Teff^4 + (spotted area) * T_spot^4 ) * σ

But wait, the unspotty hemisphere isn't visible when the spotty hemisphere is facing us. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

The star's surface is divided into two hemispheres: one spotty, one unspotty. When the spotty hemisphere is facing us (i.e., the near side), we see all of it. The unspotty hemisphere is on the far side and not visible. So the total flux when the spotty side is visible is:

Flux_spotty = [ (unspotted area of spotty hemisphere) * Teff^4 + (spotted area) * T_spot^4 ] * σ

Because the unspotty hemisphere is not seen, so only the spotty hemisphere contributes.

Wait, no. The unspotty hemisphere is the other hemisphere. So when the spotty hemisphere is facing us, the unspotty is on the back. So the flux is from the spotty hemisphere's unspotted regions plus its spotted regions.

Wait, but the unspotty hemisphere is entirely at Teff, but when the spotty hemisphere is visible, the unspotty is on the far side, so we can't see it. So the flux when the spotty hemisphere is visible is:

Flux_spotty = [ (unspotted area of spotty hemisphere) * Teff^4 + (spotted area) * T_spot^4 ] * σ

So, the unspotted area on the spotty hemisphere is 1.6 π R² (since 20% is spotted, 80% is unspotted), and the spotted area is 0.4 π R².

So:

Flux_spotty = (1.6 π R² Teff^4 + 0.4 π R² T_spot^4 ) * σ

Flux_unspotty = [2 π R² Teff^4 ] * σ

Because when the unspotty hemisphere is visible, we see all of that hemisphere, which is 2π R², and all at Teff.

So the difference in flux between when the spotty hemisphere is visible and when it's not is:

ΔF = Flux_spotty - Flux_unspotty

= [ (1.6 π R² Teff^4 + 0.4 π R² T_spot^4 ) - 2 π R² Teff^4 ] * σ

Simplify the terms:

1.6 π R² Teff^4 + 0.4 π R² T_spot^4 - 2 π R^2 Teff^4 

= (1.6 - 2) π R² Teff^4 + 0.4 π R² T_spot^4

= (-0.4 π R² Teff^4 ) + 0.4 π R² T_spot^4

Factor 0.4 π R²:

= 0.4 π R² ( -Teff^4 + T_spot^4 )

= 0.4 π R² (T_spot^4 - Teff^4 )

So ΔF = 0.4 π R² (T_spot^4 - Teff^4 ) σ

But wait, T_spot is less than Teff, so (T_spot^4 - Teff^4) is negative. So ΔF is negative, which makes sense because the flux is lower when the spots are visible.

So the change in flux is ΔF = -0.4 π R² (Teff^4 - T_spot^4 ) σ

The flux is lower when the spots are visible. The amplitude of the brightness variation is the difference between the maximum and minimum fluxes. Wait, when the spotty side is visible, the flux is lower; when the unspotty side is visible, the flux is higher (because all the unspotty areas, including the other hemisphere, are visible? Wait, no.

Wait, when the unspotty hemisphere is visible, the entire unspotty hemisphere is at Teff, and the spotty hemisphere is on the far side, so we don't see any spots. So the flux is higher when the unspotty side is visible.

Wait, but earlier, when the spotty hemisphere is visible, the flux is lower, and when the unspotty is visible, the flux is higher.

So the maximum flux is Flux_unspotty, and the minimum is Flux_spotty.

So the amplitude of the variation would be (Flux_unspotty - Flux_spotty)/Flux_unspotty.

Let me compute that.

Flux_unspotty = 2 π R² Teff^4 σ

Flux_spotty = (1.6 π R² Teff^4 + 0.4 π R² T_spot^4 ) σ

Wait, no. Wait, when the unspotty hemisphere is visible, the flux is 2π R² Teff^4 σ, because that's the entire area we can see.

When the spotty hemisphere is visible, the flux is (1.6 π R² Teff^4 + 0.4 π R² T_spot^4 ) σ.

So the difference between the two is:

Flux_unspotty - Flux_spotty = [2 π R² Teff^4 - (1.6 π R² Teff^4 + 0.4 π R² T_spot^4 ) ] σ 

= [0.4 π R² Teff^4 - 0.4 π R² T_spot^4 ] σ 

= 0.4 π R² (Teff^4 - T_spot^4 ) σ 

So the amplitude is:

Amplitude = (Flux_unspotty - Flux_spotty)/Flux_unspotty 

= [0.4 π R² (Teff^4 - T_spot^4 ) σ ] / [2 π R² Teff^4 σ ]

Simplify:

The 0.4 and 2 can be written as 0.4 / 2 = 0.2.

The π R² σ terms cancel out.

So:

Amplitude = 0.2 (Teff^4 - T_spot^4 ) / Teff^4 

= 0.2 (1 - (T_spot/Teff)^4 )

Plugging in the numbers:

Teff = 6000 K,

T_spot = 5000 K.

So T_spot / Teff = 5000/6000 = 5/6 ≈ 0.8333.

Compute (T_spot/Teff)^4 = (5/6)^4.

Hmm, 5^4 is 625, 6^4 is 1296. So 625/1296 ≈ 0.48225.

So 1 - 0.48225 = 0.51775.

Multiply by 0.2: 0.2 * 0.51775 ≈ 0.10355, or about 10.355%.

So the amplitude is approximately 10.355% of the star's flux.

Wait, but that's the amplitude caused by the spots. Now, we need to find the radius of a planet that would cause the same amplitude when it transits the star.

So when a planet transits the star, it blocks some of the star's light, causing a dip in brightness. The amplitude (depth) of this dip is proportional to (R_planet / R_star)^2, assuming the planet is much smaller than the star and the alignment is perfect.

So the transit depth is (R_planet / R_star)^2.

We need this to be equal to the spot-induced amplitude of about 0.10355.

So:

(R_planet / R_star)^2 = 0.10355

Take square root:

R_planet / R_star = sqrt(0.10355) ≈ sqrt(0.10355) ≈ 0.3218.

Wait, sqrt(0.1) is ~0.316, so 0.3218 is about 0.32.

Looking at the options, option D is ~0.32.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check the calculation.

Wait, the amplitude due to the planet is (R_planet / R_star)^2.

But wait, the star's flux is L = 4π R_star² σ Teff^4.

When the planet transits, it blocks an area of π R_planet². So the blocked flux is (π R_planet² / 4π R_star²) ) * L.

Blocked fraction is (R_planet²)/(4 R_star²).

Wait, wait, no. Let me think again.

The planet's area is π R_planet².

The star's area is 4 π R_star².

So the fraction of the star's light blocked is (R_planet²)/(4 R_star²) * (star's surface brightness).

Wait, actually, the surface brightness of the star is uniform (if no spots), so the flux is F = (L / 4π) * (Area blocked) / (R_star²) )

Wait, perhaps an easier way is to think in terms of area.

The flux from the star is proportional to its surface area times the surface brightness (which is σ Teff^4 per unit area).

When the planet transits, it blocks an area A_p = π (R_p)^2.

The blocked flux is A_p * σ Teff^4.

The total flux from the star is 4 π R_star² σ Teff^4.

So the fractional change is (A_p) / (4 π R_star²) ) = (π R_p²) / (4 π R_star² ) ) = (R_p²) / (4 R_star² )

So the amplitude is (R_p / (2 R_star))^2.

Wait, no. Because:

Fractional change is (blocked flux)/(total flux).

Blocked flux: π R_p² σ Teff^4.

Total flux: 4 π R_star² σ Teff^4.

So fractional change is (π R_p²) / (4 π R_star²) ) = (R_p²)/(4 R_star^2) = (R_p/(2 R_star))^2.

Wait, that would be the case if the star's entire surface is at Teff. But in our case, the star's surface has spots that lower the flux when they're visible.

Wait, but for the planet transit, the star's entire surface is at Teff, so the calculation is as above.

So the fractional dip is (R_p/(2 R_star))^2.

Wait, but that can't be right because when R_p is R_star, the dip would be (1/(2))^2= 0.25, which is 25% dip, which makes sense. But when R_p is smaller, the dip is smaller.

Wait, but the spot-induced dip is about 10.355% as calculated earlier. So setting the planet's dip equal to that:

(R_p/(2 R_star))^2 = 0.10355

So R_p/(2 R_star) = sqrt(0.10355) ≈ 0.3218

Thus, R_p = 2 R_star * 0.3218 ≈ 0.6436 R_star.

Wait, that gives R_p/Rstar ≈ 0.64, which is not any of the options. Hmm, that's conflicting with earlier.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the spot-induced amplitude calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the spot-induced dip as a dip in the total flux. Let me re-calculate the spot-induced amplitude.

Alternative approach: the star's flux without spots is F0 = 4π R_star² σ Teff^4.

When the spots are visible, the flux is F_spotty = F0 * (1 - (A_spots * (T_spot^4 - Teff^4) / Teff^4 )) )

Wait, because the spots have lower temperature. So the flux from the spots is (A_spots) * σ T_spot^4. The rest is (A_unspotted) * σ Teff^4.

So the flux is F = (A_unspotted * Teff^4 + A_spots * T_spot^4 ) * σ.

The total area A_unspotted + A_spots = 2 π R_star^2 (since only the hemisphere is spotty).

So F_spotty = [ (2 π R_star^2 - A_spots) * Teff^4 + A_spots * T_spot^4 ] * σ.

The maximum flux without spots (if the star was not spotted) would be when the entire star is at Teff. But the star is only partially spotted on one hemisphere, so when the unspotty hemisphere is visible, the flux is F_unspotty = 2 π R_star^2 Teff^4 * σ.

Wait, no. Wait, no, the star's total surface area is 4 π R^2, but when the unspotty hemisphere is visible, the flux is 2 π R^2 Teff^4 * σ.

When the spotty hemisphere is visible, the flux is (2 π R^2 - A_spots) Teff^4 σ + A_spots T_spot^4 σ.

So the difference between F_unspotty and F_spotty is:

ΔF = F_unspotty - F_spotty = [2 π R^2 Teff^4 σ] - [ (2 π R^2 - A_spots) Teff^4 σ + A_spots T_spot^4 σ ]

= [2 π R^2 Teff^4 - (2 π R^2 - A_spots) Teff^4 - A_spots T_spot^4 ] σ

= [ 2 π R^2 Teff^4 - 2 π R^2 Teff^4 + A_spots Teff^4 - A_spots T_spot^4 ] σ

= [ A_spots (Teff^4 - T_spot^4) ] σ

So the amplitude is ΔF / F_unspotty:

Amplitude = [ A_spots (Teff^4 - T_spot^4 ) σ ] / [ 2 π R^2 Teff^4 σ ]

Simplify:

= [ A_spots (Teff^4 - T_spot^4) ] / [ 2 π R^2 Teff^4 ]

A_spots is 0.2 * 2 π R^2 = 0.4 π R^2.

So:

= [0.4 π R^2 (Teff^4 - T_spot^4) ] / [ 2 π R^2 Teff^4 ]

Cancel π R^2:

= 0.4 (Teff^4 - T_spot^4) / (2 Teff^4 )

= 0.2 (1 - (T_spot / Teff)^4 )

Which brings us back to the same calculation as before: 0.2*(1 - (5/6)^4) ≈ 0.2*(1 - 0.48225) ≈ 0.2*0.51775 ≈ 0.10355, which is about 10.355% amplitude.

So the amplitude due to the spots is about 10.355% dip.

Now, the planet transit would cause a dip of (R_p / R_star)^2, because when a planet transits, it blocks an area of π R_p^2, and the star's area is π R_star^2 per hemisphere? Wait, no.

Wait, when the planet transits, it blocks a part of the star's disk, which is a circle with area π R_p^2. The star's total area is 4 π R_star^2, but when the planet is in front, it blocks a part of the star's surface.

So the fractional change in flux is (π R_p^2) / (π (2 R_star)^2 )? No, no, the area blocked is π R_p^2, and the star's area is 4 π R_star^2. So the fractional change is (R_p^2)/(4 R_star^2) = (R_p/(2 R_star))^2.

Wait, but that would mean the fractional dip is (R_p/(2 R_star))^2. So if R_p = R_star, the dip would be (1/2)^2 = 0.25, which is a 25% dip. But in reality, the maximum dip for a transit is when the planet covers a part of the star, but perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Wait, no, no, the planet must cover a part of the star's disk. The maximum dip occurs when the planet fully covers a part of the star's disk. The area blocked is π R_p^2. The star's area is 4 π R_star^2. So the fractional dip is (π R_p^2) / (4 π R_star^2) ) = (R_p^2)/(4 R_star^2) = (R_p/(2 R_star))^2.

So, the dip is (R_p/(2 R_star))^2. So for the dip to equal the spot-induced amplitude of ~0.10355, we have:

(R_p/(2 R_star))^2 = 0.10355

Take square root:

R_p/(2 R_star) = sqrt(0.10355) ≈ 0.3218

So R_p = 2 R_star * 0.3218 ≈ 0.6436 R_star.

But wait, this would make R_p/R_star ≈ 0.64, which isn't one of the options. The options were A) ~0.39, B) ~0.07, C) ~0.11, D) ~0.32.

Hmm, none of these match 0.64. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, I think I messed up the area calculation. Let me think again. The area blocked is π R_p^2, but the area of the star is 4 π R_star². So the fractional dip is (R_p^2) / (4 R_star²) ) = (R_p/(2 R_star))^2.

Wait, but if R_p is 0.32 R_star, then:

(R_p/(2 R_star))^2 = (0.32/2)^2 = (0.16)^2 = 0.0256, which is 2.56% dip. But the spot-induced dip is ~10.35%, so that's much smaller. So that can't be.

Wait, but earlier I thought the planet dip is (R_p/R_star)^2. Maybe I made a mistake there. Let me think again.

Wait, the planet's area is π R_p^2. The star's area is 4 π R_star^2.

So the fraction is (π R_p^2) / (4 π R_star^2) ) = (R_p^2)/(4 R_star^2) = (R_p/(2 R_star))^2.

But earlier I thought the dip was (R_p/R_star)^2. So I might have made a mistake in that.

Wait, perhaps the correct dip is (R_p/R_star)^2. Let me check with an example. If R_p is R_star, then dip is 1, which is impossible because the star's area is 4 pi R^2. Wait, that can't be. So perhaps the correct dip is (R_p/(2 R_star))^2, as per the calculation.

Wait, but let's think in terms of a planet transit: when the planet moves in front of the star, it blocks a circle of area π R_p². So the dip in flux is (π R_p²) / (4 π R_star²) ) = (R_p²)/(4 R_star²) ) = (R_p/(2 R_star))^2.

So for the dip to be 10.35% (0.10355), we have (R_p/(2 R_star))^2 = 0.10355 → R_p/(2 R_star) ≈ 0.3218 → R_p ≈ 0.6436 R_star.

But the options don't have this. So, this suggests that I must have made a mistake in the calculation of the spot-induced dip.

Wait, perhaps I should have considered the entire star's luminosity and the spots on one hemisphere. Let's think again.

The star's total luminosity without any spots is L0 = 4 π R_star² σ Teff^4.

When the spots are present but the unspotty hemisphere is visible, the flux is:

L_unspotty = 2 π R_star² σ Teff^4.

When the spotty hemisphere is visible, the flux is:

L_spotty = (2 π R_star² - A_spots) σ Teff^4 + A_spots σ T_spot^4.

So the difference between the two is:

ΔL = L_unspotty - L_spotty = [2 π R² σ Teff^4 ] - [ (2 π R² - A_spots) σ Teff^4 + A_spots σ T_spot^4 ]

= [ 2 π R² σ Teff^4 - 2 π R² σ Teff^4 + A_spots σ Teff^4 - A_spots σ T_spot^4 ]

= [ A_spots σ (Teff^4 - T_spot^4) ]

So the fractional change is:

ΔL / L_unspotty = [ A_spots (Teff^4 - T_spot^4) ] / [ 2 π R² Teff^4 ]

A_spots is 0.2 * 2 π R² = 0.4 π R².

So:

ΔL / L_unspotty = [0.4 π R² (Teff^4 - T_spot^4)] / [2 π R² Teff^4 ]

= 0.4 (Teff^4 - T_spot^4) / (2 Teff^4 )

= 0.2 (1 - (T_spot / Teff)^4 )

Which brings us back to the same 10.35% dip.

So to have the same dip, the planet would need to cause a dip of 10.35%.

So (R_p/(2 R_star))^2 = 0.10355 → R_p/(2 R_star) = sqrt(0.10355) ≈ 0.3218 → R_p ≈ 0.6436 R_star.

But none of the options are near 0.64.

Wait, but perhaps I mixed up the denominator. Maybe it's R_p/R_star, not R_p/(2 R_star).

Wait, if the dip is (R_p / R_star)^2, then:

(R_p / R_star)^2 = 0.10355 → R_p/R_star ≈ sqrt(0.10355) ≈ 0.3218 → 0.32. Which is option D.

Ah, so perhaps I was wrong before. Let me clarify.

The dip caused by the planet is (π R_p²) / (4 π R_star²) ) = (R_p²)/(4 R_star²) ) = (R_p/(2 R_star))^2, which is 0.10355.

But wait, if I instead have the dip being (R_p/R_star)^2, then R_p/R_star would be about 0.32, which is option D. So which is correct?

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing between the area of the planet and the area it blocks. Let me think again.

The planet's area is π R_p². The star's area is 4 π R_star². So the fraction is (R_p²)/(4 R_star²) ) = (R_p/(2 R_star))^2.

So the dip is (R_p/(2 R_star))^2, which for 0.10355 dip gives R_p = 0.6436 R_star, which isn't an option. So I must have made a mistake here.

Wait, but perhaps the star is being observed such that only a hemisphere is visible at a time, as in the case of the spots. So the star's flux when the unspotty hemisphere is visible is when the entire unspotty hemisphere (2 π R²) is emitting at Teff. So the flux is 2 π R² σ Teff^4.

When the planet transits, it blocks a part of the star's disk, which is either the spotty or unspotty hemisphere, but in the case of the planet, it's anywhere on the star.

So the dip in flux when the planet transits would be:

ΔF_planet = (π R_p²) * σ Teff^4 / [2 π R² σ Teff^4 ] = (R_p²) / (2 R²) )

Wait, because the star's flux when the unspotty hemisphere is visible is 2 π R² σ Teff^4. So the dip is (planet's area) * (surface brightness) divided by (unspotty hemisphere's area * surface brightness). 

So dip = ( π R_p^2 σ Teff^4 ) / (2 π R^2 σ Teff^4 ) ) = (R_p^2)/(2 R^2) = (R_p/R)^2 * 0.5.

Wait, that makes the dip ( (R_p/R)^2 ) * 0.5.

So the dip is (R_p/R)^2 * 0.5.

So to get a dip of 0.10355:

(R_p/R)^2 * 0.5 = 0.10355 → (R_p/R)^2 = 0.2071 → R_p/R ≈ sqrt(0.2071) ≈ 0.455. So around 0.455 R_star.

But that's not an option either. Hmm.

Wait, I'm getting more confused. Let me think differently.

The dip caused by the planet is (Area of planet / Area of star) when the planet transits. So dip = (π R_p^2) / (4 π R_star^2) ) = R_p^2 / (4 R_star^2) ) = (R_p/(2 R_star))^2.

But in the case of the spot situation, the maximum dip is 10.35%, which is higher than the planet's dip if R_p is small. So perhaps the planet's dip is (R_p/(R_star))^2, not divided by 2.

Wait, perhaps I should model the star's surface as being split into two hemispheres, but when the planet transits, it can cover any part of the star, not just a hemisphere.

Wait, but the star emits from its entire surface when unspotted. So when the planet transits, it blocks part of the star, regardless of whether it's the spotty or unspotty area. But when the planet is causing a dip, the maximum dip would be when it's covering the spotty area, but perhaps that's not relevant here since we are comparing the two scenarios.

Wait, but the problem states that to produce the same amplitude signal as the spots, what should be the planet's radius. So perhaps the approach is to compute the dip caused by the planet as if it's blocking the same area as the spots.

Wait, perhaps the spot-induced dip is due to the area of the spots, and the planet's dip is the same area.

So the area of the spots on the spotty hemisphere is A_spots = 0.4 π R².

The planet's area is π R_p².

So setting π R_p² = 0.4 π R² → R_p² = 0.4 R² → R_p = sqrt(0.4) R ≈ 0.632 R. Which is about 0.63 R, which again is not an option.

Hmm. I'm getting stuck here. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I should compare the amplitude of the brightness variation caused by the spots to that caused by the planet.

The amplitude from the spots is about 10.35%, as I calculated.

The amplitude from the planet is (R_p/R_star)^2, assuming the planet is much smaller than the star and the transit is central.

So to have the same amplitude:

(R_p/R_star)^2 = 0.10355 → R_p/R_star ≈ sqrt(0.10355) ≈ 0.3218, so 0.32 R, which is option D.

Wait, but earlier I thought that the planet's dip is (R_p/(2 R_star))^2, but perhaps that's incorrect. Maybe the correct dip is (R_p/R_star)^2.

Let me clarify. The star's total area is 4 π R_star². The planet blocks an area of π R_p². So the dip is (π R_p^2) / (4 π R_star^2) ) = (R_p^2)/(4 R_star^2) ) = (R_p/(2 R_star))^2.

But if the dip is (R_p/(2 R_star))^2 = 0.10355 → R_p = 0.6436 R_star, which is 0.64 R, not an option.

But if I instead have (R_p/R_star)^2 = 0.10355 → R_p = 0.3218 R_star, which is option D.

So what's the correct way? I'm getting conflicting results.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that when the star has spots, the brightness variation is due to the change in the area of the spotted regions coming into view, but when the planet transits, it blocks a part of the star's disk, which could include both spotted and unspotted regions. But the problem states that the star has one hemisphere covered in spots, and the other is spot-free. So in the planet's case, the dip depends on where the planet transits.

But the question says to produce the same amplitude, so perhaps we're to assume that the planet transits over the spotty area, thus causing the maximum possible dip. So the area blocked by the planet is the same as the area of the spots.

Wait, but the area of the spots is 0.2 * 2 π R² = 0.4 π R². So the planet's area would need to be 0.4 π R². So the planet's radius R_p is sqrt(0.4 π R² / π ) = sqrt(0.4) R ≈ 0.632 R. Again, not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the effective area that changes the brightness is 0.4 π R², and the planet would block that same area when it transits. So the planet's area is 0.4 π R² → π R_p² = 0.4 π R² → R_p² = 0.4 R² → R_p = sqrt(0.4) R ≈ 0.632 R.

But that's not matching any options either.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the problem differently. The question states that both the spots and the planet produce the same amplitude in the light curve. The amplitude comes from the fractional change in brightness.

In the case of the spots, the amplitude is approximately 10.35%, as calculated.

In the case of the planet, the amplitude is (R_p/R_star)^2, because the planet blocks a part of the star's light.

So setting (R_p/R_star)^2 = 0.10355 → R_p/R_star ≈ 0.3218, which is option D.

So the answer should be D) ~0.32.

To determine the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation as the spotted star, we analyze the fractional change in brightness caused by both the spots and the planet.

### Step 1: Brightness Variation Due to Spots
The star has a radius equal to the Sun's ($R_{\text{star}}$), an effective temperature of $T_{\text{eff}} = 6000$ K, and one hemisphere covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%. The spots are cooler, with a temperature of $T_{\text{spot}} = 5000$ K. The brightness variation is caused by the rotational modulation of the spots.

The total flux from the star when the unspotty hemisphere is visible is:

\[
F_{\text{unspotty}} = 2 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \sigma T_{\text{eff}}^4
\]

When the spotty hemisphere is visible, the flux is reduced due to the cooler spots. The area of the spots is $A_{\text{spots}} = 0.2 \times 2 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 = 0.4 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2$. The flux in this case is:

\[
F_{\text{spotty}} = \left[(2 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 - 0.4 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2) \sigma T_{\text{eff}}^4 + 0.4 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \sigma T_{\text{spot}}^4\right]
\]

The amplitude of the brightness variation is the fractional change in flux between the two cases:

\[
\text{Amplitude} = \frac{F_{\text{unspotty}} - F_{\text{spotty}}}{F_{\text{unspotty}}}
\]

Simplifying:

\[
\text{Amplitude} = 0.2 \left(1 - \left(\frac{T_{\text{spot}}}{T_{\text{eff}}}\right)^4\right)
\]

Substituting $T_{\text{eff}} = 6000$ K and $T_{\text{spot}} = 5000$ K:

\[
\left(\frac{T_{\text{spot}}}{T_{\text{eff}}}\right)^4 = \left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^4 \approx 0.48225
\]

\[
\text{Amplitude} = 0.2 \times (1 - 0.48225) \approx 0.10355 \, \text{(or 10.355%)}.
\]

### Step 2: Brightness Variation Due to a Planet
When a planet transits the star, it blocks a fraction of the star's light proportional to the planet's area relative to the star's area. The fractional dip in brightness is:

\[
\text{Dip} = \left(\frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}}\right)^2
\]

To match the amplitude of 10.355%, we set:

\[
\left(\frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}}\right)^2 = 0.10355
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
\frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \approx \sqrt{0.10355} \approx 0.3218
\]

Thus, the radius of the planet relative to the star is approximately $0.32$.

### Step 3: Final Answer
The closest option to the calculated value is:

**D) ~0.32**
