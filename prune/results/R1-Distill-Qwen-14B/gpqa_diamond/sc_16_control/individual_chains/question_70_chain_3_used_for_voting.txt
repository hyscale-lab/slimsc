Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question describes a series of reactions, and I need to figure out the molecular symmetry group of product E. The options are A to D, with various symmetry groups. Hmm, I remember that symmetry groups are related to the shapes of molecules, like how symmetrical they are.

Let me break down the reactions first. 

1. Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. So the reaction is A + 8B → C. I'm thinking, what solid reacts with a gas in an 8:1 ratio to produce a red compound. Oh, wait, maybe sulfur reacting with something? Or perhaps a transition metal? Hmm. Wait, another thought: sodium reacting with chlorine? No, sodium is a solid, but 8 equivalents? Wait, maybe the reaction is something like the formation of a sulfide or oxide.

Wait, another thought: nitric acid reactions. Or maybe it's about the Haber process? No, that's ammonia. Wait, sodium reacting with something. Alternatively, maybe it's about the reaction of a metal with a halogen. For example, aluminum and chlorine? Wait, aluminum reacts with chlorine gas in a certain ratio. Let me think: Aluminum has a valency of 3, and chlorine is 1 each. So 4 moles of Al would react with 3 moles of Cl2? No, wait, maybe I'm mixing it up.

Alternatively, perhaps A is a metal and B is a halogen. Let's say A is sodium (Na), and B is chlorine (Cl2). Sodium reacts with chlorine gas in a 2:1 ratio. Wait, but the question says 8 equivalents of B. Oh, maybe it's a stoichiometric ratio. So for every mole of A, 8 moles of B are used. So A might be something with a +1 charge because 8 B would be 8 * something that's -1 each. Hmm, but 8 is a big number. Wait, maybe A is a metal with a +2 charge, and B is something with a -1 charge. So 4 equivalents would be needed, but the question says 8. Hmm. Maybe the metal has a higher charge. Alternatively, perhaps B is O2, but that's a gas. Let's think differently.

Wait, the product C is bright red. Bright red makes me think of... maybe a product containing copper, which can be red. Or perhaps something like mercury(II) oxide is red, but I'm not sure. Oh wait! Maybe the reaction is between a metal and sulfur. Because when metals react with sulfur, they form metal sulfides, which can be various colors. For example, copper forms CuS, which is black, but maybe another metal.

Wait, another thought: When a metal like iron reacts with sulfur, it forms FeS, which is black. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps A is something else. Let me think about the other reactions.

C reacts with D in a 2:1 ratio to produce E, which is extremely hazardous. Then, C reacts with water to form A, F, and G. F is a strong acid, G a weak acid. So when C is reacted with water, it produces A (the original solid) and two acids. So C must be a compound that, upon hydrolysis, releases a metal (A) and two acids. That makes me think of a salt that's a sulfide or something similar. Wait, no, because if it's a sulfide, hydrolysis would produce H2S and the metal hydroxide, but that's not an acid.

Wait, perhaps C is a nitride? Nitrides react with water to produce NH3 and metal hydroxides, but that doesn't fit the acids. Alternatively, maybe C is a carbonate? No, because carbonates usually produce bicarbonate and then CO2 and metal hydroxides.

Alternatively, C might be a sulfate? No, because sulfate would produce SO4^2-, which would need more protons. Hmm.

Wait, let's think about the first reaction again. A reacts with 8 equivalents of B to form C. If B is a diatomic gas, like Cl2, then 8 equivalents would mean 8 moles of Cl2 for each mole of A. So A would have a +8 charge? That doesn't make sense because most elements don't have an 8+ charge. Wait, perhaps B is O2? No, O2 is diatomic, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps B is a gas like H2. So A plus 8 H2 → C. But what would that form? Maybe a metal hydride, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle. Let's think about possible products. C reacts with D to form E, which is dangerous. Also, D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent. So D and B might be something like HCl and NaOH? Wait, no, because D is a gas. Hmm.

Alternatively, D could be CO2, and B could be something else. Or maybe D is NH3 and B is something else. Wait, let's think about H being a solvent. Common solvents are water, ethanol, methanol, etc. But D and B reacting in 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent.

Hmm, maybe B is H2O and D is something else. Wait, but B is a gas. Maybe B is H2 and D is something like Cl2? But that's speculative.

Wait, let's think about the product E. It's extremely hazardous. So E could be something like HCl, but that's not a product of C and D. Alternatively, E could be something like phosgene or sarin gas, but perhaps more likely, E is something like a highly toxic gas or a cyanide compound.

Wait, maybe E is a highly toxic gas like HCN. But how would that form from C and D? Let me think. If D is something like HCN and C is a cyanide salt. Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Let me try to think of C. When C reacts with water, it gives back A, F, and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. So perhaps C is a nitride, which would hydrolyze to produce NH3 and a strong acid. Wait, but NH3 is a weak base, not an acid. Alternatively, maybe C is a sulfide, but that would produce H2S, which is a weak acid. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps C is a metal carbonate. But carbonate would hydrolyze to CO2 (acid) and the metal hydroxide, which isn't an acid. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfate, but that would produce SO4^2-; again, not an acid.

Wait, considering F is a strong acid and G is a weak acid, perhaps C is a salt of a strong base and weak acid. So when C is dissolved in water, it hydrolyzes to produce the weak acid and the strong base, which would then react with water to produce the strong acid. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, another approach: perhaps C is a sulfite, which would hydrolyze to produce H2SO3 (weak acid) and the metal hydroxide. But then, where does the strong acid come from?

Alternatively, perhaps C is a nitride, like AlN, which reacts with water to produce NH3 and the metal's hydroxide. But NH3 is a weak base, not an acid.

Hmm, maybe I'm going down the wrong path. Let me think about the first reaction again. 8 equivalents of B. So the stoichiometry is 1 A : 8 B → C. Let me think of a reaction where a metal reacts with a gas in a high ratio.

Wait, perhaps A is sodium (Na) and B is chlorine (Cl2). The reaction is 2 Na + Cl2 → 2 NaCl. But that's 2 equivalents of B per A. But in the question, it's 8 equivalents. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe A is aluminum (Al) and B is Cl2. The reaction is 2 Al + 3 Cl2 → 2 AlCl3. So 1.5 equivalents of B per A. But the question says 8 equivalents. So that's not matching either.

Wait, what about the formation of a metal oxide? For example, magnesium oxide. Mg + O2 → MgO. The stoichiometry is 2 Mg + O2 → 2 MgO, so 1 equivalent of O2 per 2 Mg. But that's 0.5 equivalents, not 8.

Hmm, maybe the reaction is something else. Let's think about other possibilities. Maybe A is a diatomic gas, but the question says solid A. So solid reacting with gas.

Wait, another thought: maybe the reaction is the formation of sulfur hexafluoride? No, that's a gas. Or perhaps the reaction is between a metal and a halogen in a high ratio. Maybe like lead and chlorine. Lead can form PbCl4, but the stoichiometry would be 1 Pb : 4 Cl2 (since each Cl2 is two Cl atoms). Wait, Pb reacts with Cl2 in a 1:4 ratio? So 1 Pb + 2 Cl2 → PbCl4. So that's 2 equivalents of Cl2 per Pb. Not 8. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps B is hydrogen gas. If A is a metal, like Na, and B is H2, then the reaction could be 2 Na + H2 → 2 NaH. So for each Na, 1 equivalent of H2. But the question has 8 equivalents, so that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps B is a gas like O3, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: The product C, when reacted with D, produces E. D is a gas that reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent. So perhaps D and B are gases that react to form a solvent. Let's think of H as water. Because water is a common solvent. So B and D could be H2O's components. But wait, B is a gas, D is another gas. So if D is H2O, but that's a liquid. Hmm. Alternatively, B and D could be H2 and O2, which combine to form H2O. So H is H2O, which is a solvent.

So, if B is H2 and D is O2, then their reaction is 2 H2 + O2 → 2 H2O. So in a 1:1 ratio, that would require 1 mole of H2 and 0.5 mole of O2, but the ratio is 2:1 for H2:O2. Wait, the question says D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio. So perhaps the stoichiometry is 1 B + 1 D → H. So H is the solvent, which is perhaps H2O. So B and D would have to combine in a 1:1 ratio to make H2O. So 2H2 + O2 → 2 H2O, which is 2:1 ratio for H2 to O2. So that doesn't fit a 1:1 ratio.

Hmm, perhaps another solvent. What about ethanol? But to make ethanol from two gases, perhaps CO2 and H2? No, that would require more steps. Alternatively, maybe H is ethylene glycol or something. Hmm, I'm getting stuck on this part.

Let me think about the product E. It's extremely hazardous. So E could be something like chlorine gas, but that's a gas. Alternatively, maybe a nerve gas, but I'm not sure about the structure. Alternatively, perhaps E is a highly toxic solid, like arsenic trioxide, but that's a solid.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about C. C is the product of A and 8 B. Then, when C reacts with D, it produces E. Also, C reacts with water to give A, F, and G, which are a strong acid and a weak acid.

Wait, what if C is a metal chloride with a high oxidation state? For example, if A is a metal that forms an 8+ charge, but that's not possible. Maybe it's a different type of compound. Alternatively, perhaps C is a polyatomic ion salt.

Wait, another thought: What if A is a metal, B is a diatomic gas like Cl2, and the reaction is A + 8 B → C. Let's say A is Fe. Iron reacts with Cl2 in a ratio of 1:3 to form FeCl3. But that's 3 equivalents, not 8. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps A is a transition metal, and the product C is a complex ion. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe B is S (sulfur) gas, but S is a solid at room temperature. Hmm.

Wait, going back to the hydrolysis reaction: C + H2O → A + F + G. F is strong acid, G is weak. So perhaps C is a nitride, like Mg3N2. Mg3N2 + H2O → Mg(OH)2 and NH3. But NH3 is a weak base, not an acid. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, C could be a sulfide, but then hydrolysis would produce H2S (weak acid) and the metal hydroxide. Again, no strong acid.

Wait, maybe C is a phosphate salt. For example, Ca3(PO4)2. But when it reacts with water, I don't think it would produce a strong acid.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps C is a carbonate. Let's say Na2CO3. When it reacts with water, it hydrolyzes to NaOH (strong base) and CO2 (weak acid). But the question says F and G are acids, so this might not fit.

Wait, perhaps C is a sulfite. Na2SO3. It reacts with water to produce H2SO3 (weak acid) and NaOH (strong base). But again, that's a base, not an acid.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe C is a nitrate salt. But nitrates are generally soluble and don't react much with water, unless it's a nitride or something else.

Wait, perhaps C is a hydrogen sulfide salt, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe C is a metal oxide. For example, if A is Na, then C could be Na2O. But Na2O reacts with water to form NaOH, which is a strong base, not an acid.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to think about E. E is produced when C reacts with D. E is extremely hazardous. So perhaps E is a highly toxic gas like HCN or Cl2. Or maybe a highly reactive compound like O3.

Alternatively, perhaps E is a highly explosive compound, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another angle: D reacts with B in 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent. So if H is H2O, then D and B must be gases that combine in a 1:1 ratio to make H2O. Let me think of the reaction 2H2 + O2 → 2H2O. But that's 2 H2 to 1 O2, so a 2:1 ratio. Doesn't fit 1:1.

Alternatively, perhaps D and B are CO2 and H2O? No, because D and B are both gases, and H is a solvent. Wait, maybe D is H2O (but that's a liquid), so that doesn't make sense.

Wait, another thought: D and B could be H2 and Cl2, but their reaction is H2 + Cl2 → 2HCl (with light). That's a 1:1 ratio. So D is H2, B is Cl2. But then H would be HCl, which is a gas, not a solvent. Hmm, not matching.

Wait, perhaps H is an alcohol, like ethanol. To make ethanol from two gases, perhaps CO2 and H2. But that's more complex, like in the Fischer-Tropsch process, which I'm not sure about.

Alternatively, perhaps H is a diatomic gas. Wait, but the question says H is a solvent, which is usually a liquid or a solution.

Wait, maybe H is ethylene glycol. To make that, perhaps from CO and H2. But again, the reaction details are unclear.

This is getting too complicated. Let me think about the possible products and their structures.

Wait, perhaps C is a halide. Let's say C is AgCl. Then, when AgCl reacts with D, what could happen? If D is something like HNO3, but D is a gas. Alternatively, D could be NH3, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the reaction C + D → E. If E is extremely hazardous, perhaps it's a nerve agent or a highly toxic gas. But without knowing C and D, it's hard to say.

Let me think about the other clues again. C reacts with water to give A, F, and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. So when C is in water, two acids are formed. So perhaps C is a salt that can hydrolyze into two different acids.

Wait, another possibility: C could be a sulfite, which would hydrolyze into H2SO3 (weak acid) and the metal hydroxide. But metal hydroxide isn't an acid. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a mixed salt, like a nitrate and another acid. No, not sure.

Wait, perhaps C is a nitride. Let's say, for example, AlN. AlN + H2O → Al(OH)3 and NH3. But NH3 is a weak base, not an acid. Hmm.

Wait, maybe C is a carbonate. Na2CO3 + H2O → 2NaOH + CO2↑. So NaOH is a strong base, and CO2 is a weak acid. But the question says F and G are acids, so this would fit if F is CO2 (weak acid) and another acid. But NaOH is a base, not an acid. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps C is a metal bicarbonate. Like NaHCO3. When it reacts with water, it would produce Na2CO3, CO2, and H2O. Not sure.

Wait, another angle: The strong acid F and weak acid G. One possibility is HNO3 (strong) and H2CO3 (weak). So perhaps C is a carbonate nitride or something. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a nitro compound. But when nitrated compounds react with water, they might not produce acids.

Hmm, I'm not making progress on this. Let me think about the symmetry group question. The options are C2, D4h, D∞h, C2v.

These are molecular symmetry groups. D∞h is the symmetry of a linear molecule, like CO2, H2O, etc. D4h is a higher symmetry group, perhaps for a square planar molecule. C2 is a two-fold rotation axis.

Wait, E is the product of C and D. If E is a molecule with high symmetry, like CO2 or H2O, then its symmetry group would be D∞h. But CO2's symmetry group is D∞h.

But wait, if E is a linear molecule, like CO2, then it would have D∞h symmetry. Alternatively, if E is a molecule with a two-fold axis, like H2O, which actually has a C2v symmetry because of the bent structure.

Wait, what's the symmetry of H2O? H2O has a bent structure, which is V-shaped. The symmetry group for H2O is C2v. Because it has a two-fold rotation axis (C2) and two mirror planes (σv), making the group C2v.

Wait, but CO2 is linear, with D∞h symmetry. So if E is CO2, the symmetry group is D∞h. If E is H2O, symmetry group is C2v.

So which one is E?

Let me think about the reactions again. When C reacts with D, which is a gas, to form E, which is extremely hazardous. If E is a toxic gas, maybe Cl2, but Cl2 has D∞h symmetry (linear molecule). So Cl2 would have D∞h.

Wait, but Cl2 is diatomic, linear, so yes, D∞h.

Alternatively, maybe E is HCN, which is linear, so D∞h.

Wait, but another thought: if E is phosgene (COCl2), it's a toxic gas, but its structure is planar, with a central carbon double-bonded to O and two Cl atoms. So the molecule is trigonal planar, which has D3h symmetry. Not in the options.

Alternatively, maybe E is O3 (ozone), which is a triatomic molecule with a bent structure. O3 has a C2v symmetry. Wait, O3 has a bent structure with a central O, so its point group is C2v. Alternatively, perhaps D3h, but I'm not sure.

Wait, ozone's structure is O-O-O, bent, with the central O having a double bond. The symmetry elements include a C2 axis perpendicular to the central O and two mirror planes. So the point group is D3h? Or C2v?

Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on that. Let me think. Ozone has a central O with two O's on either side, bent. The molecule has a C2 axis perpendicular to the plane (through the central O), and two mirror planes that include this C2 axis and each of the other atoms. So the symmetry is D3h? Or maybe C2v. I think it's actually D3h because of the higher symmetry with the multiple planes.

But the options don't include D3h, so perhaps I should focus on another possibility.

Alternatively, if E is a molecule like H2O, which is bent (C2v symmetry) or CO2 (linear, D∞h). So if E is a linear molecule, D∞h is the symmetry group.

Wait, but the question is about symmetry of E. Let's think about the options. The options are:

A) C2
B) D4h
C) D∞h
D) C2v

So the possible symmetry groups are either linear (D∞h) or bent (C2v), or others.

If E is a linear molecule like CO2 or Cl2, then it's D∞h. If E is a bent molecule like H2O or O3, it's C2v.

So which one is E?

Let me think about the reactions again. C reacts with D to produce E. D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent.

If H is H2O, then D and B must combine to form H2O. So D and B would be gases that react to form H2O. The reaction would be something like 2H2 + O2 → 2H2O. But that's a 2:1 ratio, not 1:1. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps B is O2 and D is H2, and their reaction is 2H2 + O2 → 2H2O. But that's a 2:1 ratio of H2 to O2, which is not 1:1.

Wait, unless the reaction is H2 + 2O2 → 2H2O. No, that's not correct. The correct stoichiometry is 2 H2 + O2 → 2 H2O.

So that's 2:1 for H2:O2. So that doesn't fit the 1:1 ratio required by the question.

Hmm, maybe D and B are other gases. Let's say B is CO2 and D is H2O (but H2O is a liquid, so can't be D). Alternatively, D and B could be NH3 and something else, but NH3 is a gas, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: D could be SO2 and B could be O2, but their reaction would produce SO3. But that's a 1:1 ratio? Let me see: SO2 + O2 → 2 SO3. So 1:1:2 ratio. So that's 1 mole of SO2 to 1 mole of O2, which fits a 1:1 ratio. Then H would be SO3, which is a gas but not a solvent. Hmm, not matching.

Wait, perhaps D is NH3 and B is something else. But I'm not making progress here.

Alternatively, perhaps H is something else. Maybe H is ethanol. To make ethanol from two gases, perhaps CO2 and H2. But the reaction for that would be more complex, involving catalysts.

Alternatively, maybe H is methanol. D and B could be CO and H2. The reaction would be CO + H2 → CH3OH. So 1:1 ratio. That would make sense. So D is H2, B is CO. So in the first reaction, A reacts with 8 moles of CO to form C. Then, in the second reaction, C reacts with D (H2) to form E.

But I'm not sure about the first reaction then. A + 8 CO → C. What solid A reacts with carbon monoxide in an 8:1 ratio? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps B is CO2 and D is H2. Then, B and D would react in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which could be CH3OH or something else. But I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps I should focus on the product E's symmetry, given the options. Let's consider each option:

Option C is D∞h. That's for linear molecules.

Option D is C2v. For bent molecules.

So, if E is a linear molecule, the answer is C. If it's bent, the answer is D.

Now, considering the reactions again. If C is a carbonate or something that upon reaction with D (H2) produces E. Alternatively, if E is something like HCN, which is linear, with D∞h symmetry.

Wait, HCN is a linear molecule (H-C≡N), so symmetry group D∞h.

But how would HCN form from C and D? Let's see: C reacts with D to produce E (HCN). So D would be something that can release H and CN- or similar. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps E is phosgene (O=CCl2), which is planar but with D∞h symmetry? Or maybe not.

Wait, another approach: What if E is a diatomic molecule, like Cl2 or O2. Cl2 is diatomic, linear, so D∞h symmetry.

But how would Cl2 form from C and D? Let's say C is ClO (hypochlorite) and D is Cl2. Then, reaction could be ClO + Cl2 → 2ClO2? Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe C is ClO3 and D is Cl2. Not sure.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about the other parts. C reacts with water to produce A, F, and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid.

If C is a chloride salt, like NaCl. But NaCl doesn't react with water to produce acids. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps C is a metal nitride. For example, AlN. AlN reacts with water to produce NH3 (weak base) and Al(OH)3 (weak base). Doesn't fit the acids.

Wait, another thought: If C is a sulfide, like FeS. FeS reacts with water to produce H2S (weak acid) and Fe(OH)2 (weak base). But again, only one acid.

Wait, perhaps C is a superoxide. Let's say KO2. KO2 reacts with water to produce O2, KHO2, and KOH. Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a peroxide. Like Na2O2. When Na2O2 reacts with water, it produces O2, NaOH, and H2O. Again, not acids.

Hmm, this is getting too complicated. Maybe I should make an educated guess based on the options.

If E is a linear molecule like CO2, its symmetry group is D∞h, which is option C. If E is a bent molecule like H2O, the symmetry group is C2v, option D.

But based on the reactions, let's think: when C reacts with D to form E, which is extremely dangerous. So maybe E is a nerve agent like sarin, which is more complex. Alternatively, perhaps E is a highly toxic gas like chlorine.

Wait, another thought: If E is Cl2, then its symmetry group is D∞h. But how would Cl2 form from C and D? Let me see: C could be ClO (from A + 8 B → C). Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps E is a diatomic gas, so D∞h symmetry. So the answer would be option C.

But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, if E is a bent molecule like H2O, then the symmetry group would be C2v.

Wait, another angle: The reaction of C with D to form E is in a 2:1 ratio. So perhaps C and D react in a 2:1 ratio. But I'm not sure.

Hmm, I think I'm going around in circles. Given the options, I'll have to make a guess. Based on the fact that D and B react in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent, perhaps H is H2O. Then, D and B would be H2 and O2. But their reaction is 2 H2 + O2 → 2 H2O, which is a 2:1 ratio, not 1:1. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps H is NH3. Then, D and B would be gases that combine to form NH3. For example, if B is N2 and D is H2, then 1 N2 + 3 H2 → 2 NH3. But that's a 3:1 ratio, not 1:1.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps H is CH4. To make CH4 from two gases, perhaps CO and H2. The reaction would be CO + 3 H2 → CH4 + H2O. But that's a 3:1 ratio, not 1:1.

I think I'm stuck on this part. Maybe I should focus on the symmetry groups again. 

If E is a linear molecule, the answer is C (D∞h). If it's bent, the answer is D (C2v).

Wait, another thought: E is a product of C and D. If C is a carbonate and D is H2, then E could be CO2 and H2O. But that's not a single product.

Alternatively, perhaps E is a diatomic molecule, like O2 or Cl2. O2 has D∞h symmetry, Cl2 also.

But in any case, without a clear path, I'll have to make an educated guess. I think the most likely answer is that E has D∞h symmetry, so option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves a series of reactions leading to the determination of the molecular symmetry group of product E. Here's the breakdown of the reasoning:

1. **Reaction Analysis**:  
   - Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C.  
   - C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce the extremely hazardous product E.  
   - C reacts with water to reform A, along with two acids, F (strong acid) and G (weak acid).  
   - D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent.

2. **Symmetry Groups**:  
   The possible symmetry groups for E are:  
   - **C2**: A two-fold rotation axis.  
   - **D4h**: A higher symmetry group for square planar or certain linear molecules.  
   - **D∞h**: A symmetry group for linear molecules.  
   - **C2v**: A symmetry group for bent molecules.

3. **Key Observations**:  
   - E is described as extremely hazardous, suggesting it could be a toxic gas or a highly reactive compound.  
   - If E is a linear molecule (e.g., CO2, Cl2), its symmetry group would be **D∞h**.  
   - If E is a bent molecule (e.g., H2O, O3), its symmetry group would be **C2v**.  

4. **Reaction Pathway and Symmetry**:  
   - The reactions suggest that E could be a diatomic or linear molecule, as it is a product of C and D.  
   - Based on the options, a linear molecule aligns with **D∞h** symmetry, which is consistent with highly hazardous gases like CO2 or Cl2.  

5. **Conclusion**:  
   Given the options and the reasoning, the most likely symmetry group for E is **D∞h**, corresponding to a linear molecule.

Answer: C
