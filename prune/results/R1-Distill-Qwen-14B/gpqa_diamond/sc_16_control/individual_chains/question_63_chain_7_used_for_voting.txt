Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me. Hmm, let's see what it's about. It's about a diatomic molecule modeled with the quantum rotation-vibration model, also known as the non-rigid rotor model. The question is about the momentum of a photon needed to switch the molecule to the next lowest energy state when it's in the fundamental state.

Wait, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I think the fundamental state is the lowest energy state. So if it's in its fundamental state, that's the first energy level. When a photon is absorbed, the molecule moves to the next state. But wait, do I need to consider both rotational and vibrational energy transitions here?

Wait, the problem mentions the quantum rotation-vibration model, so I think it's considering both rotation and vibration together. So the molecule has vibrational and rotational energy levels.

In the quantum harmonic oscillator model for vibrations, the energy levels are quantized. The energy levels are given by E_v = (v + 1/2) ħω, where v is the vibrational quantum number. So the fundamental state is v=0.

The rotational energy levels are given by E_J = (ħ² / (2I)) J(J+1), where I is the moment of inertia and J is the rotational quantum number. For diatomic molecules, I is μ R², where μ is the reduced mass and R is the bond length.

Wait, but in the non-rigid rotor model, I think the bond length isn't fixed, but maybe in this problem, they're treating it as a rigid rotor since the bond length is given as a fixed value. Because the non-rigid rotor is an approximation where the bond length can change slightly, but perhaps for this problem, they're using the rigid rotor model, given the fixed R.

So if the molecule is in its fundamental state, which would be the lowest possible energy state. So it must be in the vibrational ground state (v=0) and rotational ground state (J=0). So the initial state is v=0, J=0.

When a photon is absorbed, the molecule transitions to the next higher energy state. But what does "next state with the lowest possible energy" mean? Because the energy levels are quantized, the molecule can either increase its vibrational state or rotational state, but I think the transition in the quantum model would involve either a vibrational or rotational change.

Wait, but in the rigid rotor model, for a diatomic, the energy levels are E_J = B J(J+1), where B is the rotational constant. B is equal to ħ²/(2I), and I is the moment of inertia.

But the problem says the molecule can be modeled using the rotation-vibration model, so perhaps the energy is a combination of both. So the total energy would be E = E_v + E_J.

So the initial state is v=0, J=0. The next state would be the next lowest energy state. But wait, the energy levels for vibration and rotation are quantized, so the order of energy levels might be such that the first excited state could be either a higher vibrational state (v=1) or a higher rotational state (J=1), depending on which requires less energy.

So I need to find which transition—vibrational or rotational—requires a lower energy photon. Because the photon's energy will determine the momentum (p) since E = hf = pc; so the energy of the photon will be the energy difference between the initial and final states.

Wait, but the question is asking for the momentum, which is p = E/c. So I need to calculate the energy difference between the initial state (v=0, J=0) and the next state, which would be either v=1, J=0 or v=0, J=1, whichever is lower in energy.

Wait, but wait, the next state with the lowest possible energy might not necessarily be the first excited state of either the rotation or vibration. But in a typical system, the vibrational energy levels are more spaced out than rotational ones. Because, for example, the rotational energy levels have spacing of B each step, while vibrational spacing is ħω, which is usually larger than B.

Wait, let me think. The rotational constant B is given by (ħ²)/(2I). So I need to compute B and compare it with the vibrational energy quantum (ħω) to see which is larger.

Wait, but in terms of the energy quantum steps: the rotational energy for each J step is 2B (since E_J = B J(J+1), the difference between J and J+1 is 2B (J+1)). For J=0 to J=1, the energy difference is 2B*(0+1) = 2B. Wait, no, the difference between J=0 and J=1 is E_1 - E_0 = B*(1*2) - 0 = 2B.

Similarly, the vibrational energy difference between v=0 and v=1 is ħω.

So the question is which is smaller: 2B or ħω?

Because the photon with the lower energy would correspond to the lower transition. So if 2B < ħω, then the first transition would be the rotational one (J=0 → J=1), else it's the vibrational (v=0 → v=1).

So I need to compute 2B and ħω and compare.

I have the values:

Mass of X (Mx) = 20 amu
Mass of Y (My) = 2 amu
Bond length R = 2 angstroms = 2e-10 meters
Angular frequency ω = 4e14 rad/s

First, calculate the moment of inertia I.

I = μ R², where μ is the reduced mass.

μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My) = (20 * 2)/(20 + 2) = 40/22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.818 amu.

Wait, but I should convert this into kilograms because Planck's constant is in SI units.

1 amu is approximately 1.6605e-27 kg.

So μ = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) * 1.6605e-27 kg

Wait, wait, no: μ is (Mx * My) / (Mx + My) in terms of amu, so:

Mx = 20 amu, My = 2 amu.

So Mx * My = 40 (amu²)

Mx + My = 22 amu.

So μ = (40)/(22) amu = 20/11 ≈ 1.818 amu.

Convert μ to kg: 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg ≈ ?

Let's calculate:

1.818 * 1.6605 ≈ approx 3.016.

So μ ≈ 3.016e-27 kg.

Wait, let me compute more accurately:

1.818 * 1.6605e-27:

1.818 * 1.6605 = Let's compute:

1.8 * 1.6605 = approx 2.9889

0.018 * 1.6605 ≈ 0.029889

Adding gives 3.018789. So 3.018789e-27 kg.

So μ ≈ 3.0188e-27 kg.

Now, I = μ R². R is 2 angstroms, which is 2e-10 meters.

So R squared is (2e-10)^2 = 4e-20 m².

I = 3.0188e-27 kg * 4e-20 m² = 1.2075e-46 kg m².

Now, compute B, the rotational constant.

B = ħ² / (2I), where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant.

ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J s.

So ħ² is (1.0545718e-34)^2 ≈ 1.112e-68 (J s)^2.

So B = (1.112e-68) / (2 * 1.2075e-46) )

Compute denominator: 2 *1.2075e-46 = 2.415e-46.

So B ≈ 1.112e-68 / 2.415e-46 ≈ approx 4.606e-23 J.

Wait, let me compute that more accurately:

1.112e-68 / 2.415e-46 = (1.112 / 2.415) * 1e(-68 +46) = 0.4606 * 1e-22 = 4.606e-23 J.

So B ≈ 4.606e-23 J.

Now, 2B would be 9.212e-23 J.

Wait, but the vibrational energy quantum is ħω. Let's compute that.

ω = 4e14 rad/s.

So ħω = 1.0545718e-34 J s * 4e14 s⁻¹ = (1.0545718 *4 )e(-34 +14) J.

1.0545718 *4 ≈ 4.218287e-20 J.

So ħω ≈ 4.218e-20 J.

Wait, but wait, 2B is 9.212e-23 J, and ħω is 4.218e-20 J. So 2B is much smaller than ħω.

Because 9.212e-23 is much less than 4.218e-20. So 2B < ħω.

Wait, 2B is about 9e-23 J, and ħω is about 4e-20 J. So 2B is much smaller. So the energy required for a rotational transition (J=0→1) is 2B = 9.212e-23 J, which is much less than the vibrational transition (4e-20 J).

So the next state with the lowest possible energy would be the rotational transition, meaning the molecule goes from J=0 to J=1.

So the energy of the photon needed is 2B = 9.212e-23 J.

Wait, but wait, the question says the molecule is in the fundamental state, which is the lowest energy state, combining both rotation and vibration. So the fundamental state is v=0, J=0. The next possible state is either the next vibrational state (v=1, J=0) or the next rotational state (v=0, J=1). Since the rotational transition requires less energy, the molecule would preferentially absorb a photon of energy 2B.

Wait, but wait, the energy required for a rotational transition is 2B, as E_J=1 - E_J=0 = B*(2) (since E_J=0 is 0, E_J=1 is 2B). Wait, no, E_J = B J (J+1). So J=0: 0, J=1: 2B. So the difference is 2B.

So the photon's energy is 2B.

Then, the momentum p is given by E = pc → p = E/c.

So E_photon = 2B = 9.212e-23 J.

c is speed of light, approximately 3e8 m/s.

So p = (9.212e-23 J) / (3e8 m/s) = 3.07e-31 kg m/s.

Wait, but let me compute it more accurately.

Wait, 9.212e-23 / 3e8 = (9.212 / 3) * 1e-31 = approximately 3.07e-31 kg m/s.

Wait, but looking at the options, none of them are in the 1e-31 range. The options are about 1e-27 to 1e-28 kg m/s. So I'm doing something wrong.

Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in calculating B.

Wait, let's re-calculate B.

B = ħ²/(2I)

I is 1.2075e-46 kg m².

So ħ² = (1.0545718e-34)^2 = 1.112e-68 (as before).

So B = 1.112e-68 / (2 * 1.2075e-46) = 1.112e-68 / 2.415e-46.

Wait, let me compute that as exponents:

1.112e-68 / 2.415e-46 = (1.112 / 2.415) * 1e(-68 +46) = (0.4606) * 1e-22 = 4.606e-23 J.

So 2B is 9.212e-23 J. So 2B is 9.212e-23 J.

Then p = E/c = 9.212e-23 J / (3e8 m/s) = 3.07e-31 kg m/s.

Wait, but none of the options are near this value.

Wait, the options given are much larger: like 1e-27 Ns (which is kg m/s).

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the energy transition. Because in the rotational-vibration model, perhaps the transitions are such that both rotation and vibration can change. Or maybe I'm supposed to consider the energy as the sum of rotation and vibration.

Wait, no, I think the initial state is v=0, J=0. The next possible state would be the lowest possible, so either v=0, J=1 or v=1, J=0. Since the energy for J=1 is 2B and for v=1 is ħω, as I calculated.

Since 2B is much less than ħω (because 9.21e-23 J is much less than 4.218e-20 J), the photon would cause the molecule to transition to J=1, v=0.

So the energy required is 2B, which is 9.21e-23 J. So the momentum is p = E/c = 9.21e-23 / 3e8 = 3.07e-31 kg m/s.

But none of the options are anywhere near this. The options are in the 1e-27 to 1e-28 range.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of B.

Let me re-calculate the moment of inertia I.

I = μ R².

μ is (Mx * My) / (Mx + My) = (20 * 2) / (22) = 40/22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.818 amu.

Wait, amu to kg: 1.818 amu * 1.6605e-27 kg/amu = 1.818 * 1.6605e-27.

Let me compute 1.818 * 1.6605:

1.8 * 1.6605 = 2.9889
0.018 * 1.6605 = approx 0.029889
Total ≈ 3.0188.

So μ = 3.0188e-27 kg.

R is 2 angstroms = 2e-10 m.

R squared: (2e-10)^2 =4e-20 m².

So I = 3.0188e-27 kg *4e-20 m² =1.2075e-46 kg m². That part seems correct.

Then, B = ħ²/(2I) = (1.0545718e-34)^2 / (2 * 1.2075e-46)

Compute ħ squared:

(1.0545718e-34)^2 = (1.0545718)^2 *1e-68 = approx 1.112e-68.

Denominator: 2 * 1.2075e-46 = 2.415e-46.

So B= 1.112e-68 / 2.415e-46 = (1.112 / 2.415) *1e-22 = approximately 0.4606e-22 = 4.606e-23 J.

So 2B is 9.21e-23 J. So that's correct.

Hmm, but the options are way off. So maybe I'm missing something here. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the question is about a transition from the fundamental state to the next possible state, which might involve both a vibrational and a rotational change. But that would require a photon with higher energy, which doesn't make sense because the question is asking for the lowest possible energy transition.

Alternatively, perhaps the model used here combines both the vibrational and rotational energies. So the fundamental state is the lowest, and the next state has both the next vibrational and rotational states.

Wait, but the molecule is in its fundamental state, which is the combination of the lowest vibrational and rotational states. So the next state would be either the first vibrational excited state (v=1, J=0) or the first rotational excited state (v=0, J=1). Since the rotational transition requires less energy, as I found earlier, that would be the next state.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the transition is a simultaneous change in both vibrational and rotational states. But that's probably not the case here since the question is about the lowest possible energy transition.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the molecule's energy as a sum of rotational and vibrational energies, and the next state is the next higher energy state, regardless of whether it's rotational or vibrational.

Wait, but that would require knowing the relative energies. Since 2B is much less than ħω, the next state should be the rotational one.

Another possibility: perhaps the question is not considering the rotational state, but only the vibrational. But that doesn't fit with the model mentioned. Because the question states it's modeled using the rotation-vibration model, which implies that both are considered.

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in the calculation of B because I used the wrong formula. Let me double-check.

The rotational energy levels are E_J = (ħ² / (2I)) J (J+1) = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant.

So the energy difference between J=0 and J=1 is E_1 - E_0 = 2B.

Wait, correct. So 2B is the energy of the rotational transition.

Wait, but perhaps I should express the photon's momentum in terms of the energy. Let me compute the photon's energy again.

Photon's energy E_photon = 2B =9.212e-23 J.

So momentum p = E_photon / c.

c is 3e8 m/s.

So p =9.212e-23 /3e8 = 3.07e-31 kg·m/s.

But none of the options are anywhere near that. The options are:

A) 1.9e-28

B) 2.3e-27

C)1.1e-27

D)1.4e-28

Wait, 3.07e-31 is much smaller than the options. So maybe I made a mistake in considering the initial state.

Wait, perhaps the molecule is in the fundamental vibrational state but in an excited rotational state. No, the fundamental state is the lowest, so J=0 and v=0.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is using the non-rigid rotor model, which may include centrifugal distortion, but perhaps the question is expecting the Rigid Rotor model.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering a transition that combines both rotation and vibration, but I don't think that's the case.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the reduced mass μ. Let's re-calculate μ.

μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My) amu.

Mx = 20 amu, My = 2 amu.

So Mx * My = 40 (amu²)

Mx + My = 22 amu.

μ = 40/22 amu = 20/11 amu ≈ 1.818 amu.

Wait, but perhaps amu is in atomic mass units, not in kg. Wait, no, in the calculation, I correctly converted μ into kg.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the energy transition is for the vibration, not rotation. But why? Because 2B is much less than ħω, but perhaps the question is considering only the vibrational transition. That would explain the higher energy, but the options are in 1e-27 kg m/s.

Wait, let's compute the momentum for the vibrational transition.

E_photon = ħω = 1.0545718e-34 *4e14 = 4.218e-20 J.

p = E/c =4.218e-20 /3e8 = 1.406e-28 kg·m/s.

Looking at the options, option D is 1.4e-28 N·s, which is the same as 1.4e-28 kg·m/s.

So perhaps the question is considering a vibrational transition, not a rotational. But why?

Because when considering the quantum rotation-vibration model, the fundamental state is the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0). The next possible state could be either a higher vibrational state or a higher rotational state, whichever requires less energy.

Earlier, I calculated that 2B (rotational) is about 9.2e-23 J, while ħω is about 4.2e-20 J. So 2B is much smaller, so the photon for the rotational transition would have much less energy.

But the options don't have anything near 3e-31, so perhaps the question is considering a different approach.

Wait, maybe the question is not considering the rotational part but only the vibrational. Or perhaps the model assumes that the molecule is in the vibrational ground state but can have rotational transitions. But then, the rotational transitions would require photon energies much lower than the vibrational.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating the energy order. Let me check B and ħω again.

Wait, B is approximately 4.6e-23 J, so 2B is 9.2e-23 J.

ħω is 4.2e-20 J.

So 2B is much smaller; so the transition to J=1 is lower in energy than the transition to v=1.

But the options are all much larger than 3e-31, which suggests that perhaps the question is expecting a vibrational transition, not a rotational one.

Wait, perhaps I misread the question. Let me read it again.

The question says: 'the molecule is in its fundamental state, what momentum should an absorbed photon have, in order for the molecule to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy?'

Ah, but in the quantum rotation-vibration model, the states are not purely rotational or vibrational; they are a combination. So perhaps the molecule is in the lowest possible state, and the next state is the next higher state which could be either a higher vibrational state or a higher rotational state.

But the question is about the 'lowest possible energy' transition, which would be the one requiring the least energy—so the rotational transition.

So why is the calculated p (3e-31) not matching any options?

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the question is using the harmonic oscillator model, and the energy levels are E_n = (n + 1/2) ħω, where n is the vibrational quantum number.

So the fundamental state is n=0. The next state is n=1, which would require an energy of ħω (since the difference is between n=0 and n=1 is ħω).

Wait, but in that case, the energy is ħω, giving p = ħω/(c).

Wait, let me compute that.

E_photon = ħω =1.0545718e-34 J s *4e14 s⁻¹ =4.218e-20 J.

p = E_photon / c =4.218e-20 / 3e8 =1.406e-28 kg m/s, which is approximately 1.4e-28 N·s.

Looking at the options, option D is 1.4e-28. So that's one of the options.

But why does this approach not consider the rotational state?

Ah! Maybe the question is considering only the vibrational transition because it's a diatomic molecule and the question is about the quantum harmonic oscillator (vibrational) model. Or perhaps the question is considering the fundamental state as the vibrational ground state (v=0) but any rotational state. But that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the photon to cause a transition in the vibration, ignoring rotation. But that doesn't fit the given model.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think: the options suggest that the correct answer is D, which is 1.4e-28 Ns. Which corresponds to the vibrational transition.

But why would the rotational transition not be considered as the next lowest? Because rotational transitions typically require much less energy than vibrational ones.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating B because I used the wrong value for the bond length.

Wait, R is given as 2 angstroms, which is 2e-10 meters. So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the mass is in atomic mass units, but I correctly converted it to kg.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the problem uses μ in terms of the actual masses, not the reduced mass. Wait, no, because for the moment of inertia, it's definitely the reduced mass.

Wait, perhaps the question is using the rotational constant B in terms of cm^-1 or some other unit, and I forgot to convert units. But no, the formula I used is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the moment of inertia as I = M R², where M is the sum of the masses, not the reduced mass. That would be a mistake, but let's see.

If I calculate I as (Mx + My) * R², then I would get a different value.

Mx =20 amu, My=2 amu → M =22 amu.

22 amu =22 *1.6605e-27 kg = 3.653e-26 kg.

I =3.653e-26 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 =3.653e-26 *4e-20 =1.461e-45 kg m².

Then B = ħ²/(2I) = (1.0545718e-34)^2 / (2 *1.461e-45) = (1.112e-68) / (2.922e-45) → approx 3.806e-24 J.

So 2B is about 7.61e-24 J. The photon's energy would be 7.61e-24 J, so p =7.61e-24 /3e8 =2.537e-32 kg m/s. Still way too small.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Maybe I need to re-examine the question again.

Wait, the question says the molecule is in the fundamental state. Fundamental state is the lowest energy state, which in the rotation-vibration model would be the ground state for both rotation (J=0) and vibration (v=0). The next state could be either v=1, J=0 or v=0, J=1.

But the energy required is 2B for J=1 and ħω for v=1.

If 2B < ħω, then the photon's energy is 2B.

But earlier, I found that 2B is about 9.2e-23 J, and ħω is about 4.2e-20 J.

Wait, 9.2e-23 J is much smaller than 4.2e-20 J.

So the correct transition should be the rotational one, which would require a photon of energy 9.2e-23 J, giving p =3.07e-31 kg m/s.

But none of the options are close to that. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the change in momentum, not the momentum of the photon. No, the question clearly says, "momentum should an absorbed photon have."

Alternative thought: perhaps the energy difference is not just for a single transition. Maybe it's the energy difference between the ground state and the first excited state in the combined rotation-vibration model. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of B, but I can't find where.

Wait, perhaps I should recompute B using more precise numbers.

Let me recalculate B:

μ = (20 amu * 2 amu) / (20 + 2) amu = (40 amu²) / 22 amu = 40/22 amu = 20/11 ≈1.81818 amu.

Convert μ to kg: 1.81818 * 1.660539e-27 kg ≈ 3.0185e-27 kg.

I = μ R² =3.0185e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 =3.0185e-27 *4e-20 =1.2074e-46 kg m².

Then, B= ħ²/(2I) = (1.0545718e-34)^2 / (2 *1.2074e-46) = (1.112e-68) / (2.4148e-46) ≈4.606e-23 J.

So E_photon_rot =2B =9.212e-23 J.

p_rot = E_photon_rot / c =9.212e-23 /3e8 =3.07e-31 kg m/s.

Not matching any option.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the photon's momentum in the vibration-only case, ignoring rotation, which would give p =1.4e-28 kg m/s, option D.

But that would imply that the question is only about the vibrational transition, which seems inconsistent with the model mentioned.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering that the molecule is in the first energy level (v=0, J=1), and the next state is (v=1, J=0), but I don't think that's the case.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the photon causing a transition from the (v=0, J=0) state to the (v=1, J=0) state, which requires an energy of ħω, and p=1.4e-28 Ns, which is option D.

But earlier calculation shows that 2B is much smaller than ħω, so why would the transition to v=1 be the next state?

Hmm, maybe the question is designed incorrectly, or perhaps I'm missing a key concept here.

Another angle: perhaps the molecule is modeled as a rigid rotor and a harmonic oscillator, and the total energy is E = E_vib + E_rot. So the fundamental state would be E0 = (1/2) ħω + 0, but wait, no, the ground state for rotation is J=0, E_rot=0.

Wait, no, the ground state is v=0 (E_vib = (1/2) ħω ) and J=0 (E_rot=0), so E0 = (1/2) ħω.

The next possible state could be either v=1 (E_vib = (3/2) ħω ) or J=1 (E_rot = 2B).

So the energy required for the transition to v=1 is ħω, and to J=1 is 2B.

So the next state with the lowest possible energy is the one requiring the least energy. So if 2B < ħω, the transition is to J=1, else to v=1.

From earlier, 2B is 9.2e-23 J and ħω is 4.2e-20 J.

So 2B is smaller. So the photon's energy is 2B, but that gives p =3e-31, which isn't an option.

Wait, but maybe the question is considering the total energy of the molecule after transition, and the photon's energy is the sum of the vibrational and rotational energies? No, that doesn't make sense because the photon's energy would only account for one transition, either rotational or vibrational.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the energy calculation for the rotational transition. Maybe the energy required is not just 2B, but something else.

Wait, for the rigid rotor, the energy levels are E_J = B J (J+1). So for J=0, E=0; J=1, E=2B.

So the energy difference between J=0 and J=1 is 2B.

So the photon's energy should be 2B.

Hmm, but why is this not matching any of the options?

Wait, perhaps the problem uses a different value for the bond length. The bond length is given as 2 angstroms. Oh, wait, 2 angstroms is 0.2 nanometers. That seems correct.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate B in terms of cm^-1, but I don't think that's necessary since the question gives all the SI units.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute B in terms of wavenumbers and then convert to energy, but let's see.

Wait, rotational constant B is often given in cm^-1. 1 cm^-1 is approximately 1.986e-23 J.

So if B is 4.6e-23 J, that's approximately 4.6e-23 / 1.986e-23 ≈ 2.31 cm^-1.

So the rotational energy levels are about 2.31 cm^-1.

The vibrational energy quantum is ħω. Let's compute its wavenumber.

Frequency ν = ω/(2π). So ν = (4e14 rad/s) / (2π) ≈6.366e13 Hz.

The wavenumber is ν/c = 6.366e13 /3e8 ≈2.122e5 cm^-1.

So the vibrational energy quantum is about 2.12e5 cm^-1, which is way higher than the rotational one (2.3 cm^-1).

So the rotational transition is much smaller in energy.

But again, the photon's momentum from the rotational transition is way lower than the options.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the transition to the next possible state when the molecule is in the fundamental state, which is the first excited state, but that's a combination of both rotational and vibrational.

Wait, but that would require considering the energy for both transitions, which doesn't make sense because the photon can only cause a single transition.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the transition to the next state with the next higher energy, which could be a combination of rotation and vibration, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is a trick question where the photon's momentum is calculated based on the vibrational transition, despite the rotational transition being lower in energy.

But that would be incorrect, but maybe the intended answer is option D, 1.4e-28 Ns.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects you to consider only the vibrational transition, ignoring the rotational part.

In that case, the photon's momentum would be p = ħω/(c) = (1.05e-34 *4e14)/3e8 = (4.2e-20)/(3e8) = 1.4e-28 kg m/s → option D.

So perhaps the intended answer is D.

But why would the question not consider the rotational transition? Because the problem statement mentions the rotation-vibration model, which includes both.

Ah! Wait a minute, perhaps the molecule is considered to be in the fundamental rotational state, but the question is about a vibrational transition. That is, the initial state is v=0, J=0, and the next state is v=1, J=0.

But why would the rotational state not be considered when the model includes it? Because 2B is much smaller than ħω, so the next state should be J=1, v=0.

Unless the question is mistakenly considering only the vibrational transition.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is reversed, and the molecule is in the first excited state, but that's not what the question says.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Based on the calculations, the correct p should be around 3e-31, which is not among the options. But if the question expects the vibrational transition, the answer is D.

Given that the options don't match the rotational transition, perhaps the intended answer is D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves a diatomic molecule modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration (non-rigid rotor) model. The molecule is in its fundamental state, and the goal is to determine the momentum of a photon required to transition the molecule to the next state with the lowest possible energy. The fundamental state corresponds to the vibrational ground state (v=0) and rotational ground state (J=0). The next possible states are either (v=1, J=0) or (v=0, J=1). The energy required for these transitions is compared to determine the lowest energy transition.

### Key Calculations:
1. **Moment of Inertia (I):**
   The reduced mass of the molecule is calculated as:
   \[
   \mu = \frac{M_x M_y}{M_x + M_y} = \frac{20 \cdot 2}{20 + 2} = \frac{40}{22} \approx 1.818 \, \text{amu}.
   \]
   Converting to kilograms:
   \[
   \mu \approx 1.818 \cdot 1.6605 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg} \approx 3.0188 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}.
   \]
   The bond length is \( R = 2 \, \text{angstroms} = 2 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m} \). The moment of inertia is:
   \[
   I = \mu R^2 = 3.0188 \times 10^{-27} \cdot (2 \times 10^{-10})^2 = 1.2075 \times 10^{-46} \, \text{kg·m}^2.
   \]

2. **Rotational Constant (B):**
   The rotational constant is given by:
   \[
   B = \frac{\hbar^2}{2I},
   \]
   where \( \hbar = 1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \). Substituting the values:
   \[
   B = \frac{(1.0545718 \times 10^{-34})^2}{2 \cdot 1.2075 \times 10^{-46}} \approx 4.606 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}.
   \]
   The energy difference for the rotational transition (J=0 → J=1) is:
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = 2B = 9.212 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}.
   \]

3. **Vibrational Energy Transition:**
   The vibrational energy quantum is:
   \[
   \hbar \omega = \hbar \cdot \omega = (1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}) \cdot (4 \times 10^{14}) \approx 4.218 \times 10^{-20} \, \text{J}.
   \]

4. **Comparison of Transitions:**
   The rotational transition energy (\( 2B \)) is much smaller than the vibrational transition energy (\( \hbar \omega \)):
   \[
   2B = 9.212 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \quad \text{vs.} \quad \hbar \omega = 4.218 \times 10^{-20} \, \text{J}.
   \]
   Therefore, the next state with the lowest possible energy corresponds to the rotational transition (J=0 → J=1).

5. **Photon Momentum for Rotational Transition:**
   The momentum of the photon is related to its energy by \( p = \frac{E}{c} \), where \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \). Substituting \( E = 2B \):
   \[
   p = \frac{9.212 \times 10^{-23}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 3.07 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{kg·m/s}.
   \]
   However, this value does not match any of the provided options.

6. **Photon Momentum for Vibrational Transition:**
   If the question instead considers the vibrational transition (v=0 → v=1), the photon energy is \( \hbar \omega \), and the momentum is:
   \[
   p = \frac{\hbar \omega}{c} = \frac{4.218 \times 10^{-20}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 1.406 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{kg·m/s}.
   \]
   This matches option **D**.

### Conclusion:
The calculations indicate that the rotational transition requires significantly less energy than the vibrational transition. However, none of the provided options match the calculated momentum for the rotational transition. If the question intends to consider only the vibrational transition, the correct answer is **D**, corresponding to \( p = 1.4 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{N·s} \).
