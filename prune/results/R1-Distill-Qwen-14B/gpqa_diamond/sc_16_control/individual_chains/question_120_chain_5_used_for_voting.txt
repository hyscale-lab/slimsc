Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to think it through. Let me try to break it down.

The question says that stars are uniformly distributed, which I think means that their density (number per unit volume) is the same everywhere. So the density doesn't change with distance. But how does the number of stars per unit range of parallax change with parallax?

Hmm, parallax is related to distance. I remember that parallax (in parsecs) is the reciprocal of distance (in parsecs). So if a star has a parallax plx, its distance d is 1/plx. Right, because plx = 1/d, so d = 1/plx.

Now, the problem is about how the number of stars in a range of plx (let's say from plx to plx + dplx) depends on plx. So we're looking for N, the number of stars in that range, as a function of plx.

Since the stars are uniformly distributed, the number in a volume should be proportional to the volume. But wait, the volume element in spherical coordinates is 4π r² dr, right? Because when you integrate over a sphere, each shell's volume is 4π r² dr. So the number of stars in a thin shell between r and r+dr would be number density (n) times 4π r² dr.

But here, we're dealing with parallax, which is 1/r. So I need to relate dr to dplx. Let's see, since plx = 1/r, then dplx = -1/(r²) dr. Oh, because plx is 1/r, so taking derivative, dplx/d r = -1/r² → dr = - (r²) dplx. But since r is positive, and as plx decreases, r increases, I can write dr = - r² dplx. But when considering the magnitude, I'll drop the negative sign because we're looking at a range.

Wait, but in terms of plx, when plx increases, r decreases, so maybe the range in plx is from a larger number to a smaller? Hmm, not sure, but perhaps I can express everything in terms of plx.

Let me see. So, the number of stars in a parallax range from plx to plx + dplx would correspond to a distance range from d = 1/plx to d + dd = 1/(plx + dplx). Wait, but that might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to express the volume in terms of plx.

So, the volume element in terms of distance is 4π r² dr. But since plx = 1/r, dr = - (1/plx²) dplx. So substituting dr:

dr = -(1/( (1/plx) ^2 )) dplx = -(plx²) dplx.

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me re-calculate:

If plx = 1/r, then r = 1/plx.

Taking derivative of r with respect to plx: dr/dplx = -1/(plx²).

So, dr = (-1/plx²) dplx. So plugging that into the volume element:

4π r² dr = 4π (1/plx)^2 * (-1/plx²) dplx.

Wait, but the negative sign just indicates the direction, perhaps. Since we're considering a small positive dplx, which would correspond to a decrease in r (since plx increases as r decreases), so maybe the absolute value is what we need.

So, 4π (1/plx)^2 * (1/plx²) dplx ) → 4π (1/(plx^4)) dplx.

So the volume element in terms of plx is 4π/(plx^4) dplx.

Wait, but wait. Because when plx increases, the corresponding r decreases. So a small change in plx (dplx) would correspond to a change in r, but the correct way to express the volume element as a function of plx is important.

So, the number of stars in a thin shell between plx and plx + dplx would be the number density (n, which is constant) multiplied by the volume of that shell, which is 4π r^2 dr.

But since dr is in terms of dplx, and r = 1/plx, then dr = (-1/plx^2) dplx. So, dr is proportional to dplx, but with a negative sign which indicates direction. However, when we take the magnitude, it's (1/plx^2) dplx.

So, substituting r = 1/plx into 4π r^2 dr:

4π (1/plx)^2 * (1/plx^2 dplx) ) → 4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

So, the number of stars dN in this shell would be n * (4π / plx^4) dplx.

But n is the number density, so the number of stars per unit parallax range is dN/(dplx) = 4π n / plx^4.

Wait, but wait. The question is about the number of stars per unit range of plx. So, the number in a range dplx is n * 4π r² dr, and dr is (1/plx^2) dplx (without the negative sign). So, the number is n * 4π (1/plx^2) * (dplx / plx^2) ) → 4π n (1/plx^4) dplx.

So, the number per unit plx range is (4π n) / plx^4. So the number decreases as 1/plx^4.

Wait, but let me think again. Because if the parallax increases, the distance decreases, so the volume element (which depends on r² dr) would decrease. Since plx is inversely proportional to r, the volume element in terms of plx would involve higher powers of plx.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of differential elements. The number of stars in a range of plx from plx to plx + dplx is proportional to the volume between those plx values.

Alternatively, the number of stars per unit volume is uniform. So the number of stars in a volume dV is n dV.

Let me think about dV in terms of parallax. If I have a range in plx from plx to plx + dplx, then the corresponding distance goes from r = 1/plx to r = 1/(plx + dplx). Hmm, that might complicate things, but perhaps for small dplx, it's approximately the same as r to r + dr, where dr = (dplx)/(r²).

Wait, that approach might not be right. Let's try another way.

The volume between two spheres of radius r and r + dr is 4π r² dr.

Expressed in terms of plx, since plx = 1/r → r = 1/plx.

So, the volume is 4π (1/plx)^2 * dr.

But dr is the change in r corresponding to a change in plx of dplx. So, dr = (d r / d plx) * dplx.

d r / d plx is derivative of 1/plx with respect to plx, which is -1/(plx^2).

So, dr = (-1/plx²) dplx.

But we can take the absolute value, so |dr| = (1/plx²) dplx.

So, substituting back into the volume:

4π (1/plx^2) * (1/plx^2) dplx ) = 4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

So the volume element in terms of plx is (4π / plx^4) dplx.

Thus, the number of stars in this volume element is n * (4π / plx^4) dplx. So, the number of stars per unit plx is proportional to 1/plx^4.

Wait, but the options don't include 1/plx^4 as an option. Wait, looking back at the options: Option A is ~ 1/plx^4, option D is 1/plx^3.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about the number of stars in a thin shell between plx and plx + dplx.

The distance corresponding to plx is r = 1/plx. The shell's thickness in distance is dr = (d r/d plx) dplx = (-1/plx^2) dplx. So, the volume of the shell is 4π r^2 dr = 4π (1/plx)^2 * (1/plx^2) dplx. That's 4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

So the number of stars is n * 4π (1/plx^4) dplx. So the number per unit plx is proportional to 1/plx^4.

But looking at the options, option A is ~1/plx^4.

Wait, but I thought the number of stars per unit volume is constant, so as you move to higher parallax (closer stars), there are more stars in a given dplx because each shell (fixed dplx) corresponds to a larger volume at smaller distances.

Wait, but according to the calculation, the number of stars in a given dplx range decreases as 1/plx^4. So the function would be N ~ 1/plx^4. So the correct answer would be option A.

But wait, I thought the answer was 1/plx^3. Hmm. Maybe I messed up the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the flux or something else. Let me try another approach.

The number of stars in a volume element dV is n dV. The volume element in terms of distance is 4π r² dr. So, dV = 4π r² dr.

But since plx = 1/r, dr = - (1/plx²) dplx. Substituting into dV: dV = 4π (1/plx)^2 * (-1/plx^2) dplx. The negative sign indicates direction, but for the magnitude, it's 4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

So, the number of stars is n * 4π (1/plx^4) dplx. Therefore, the number per unit plx is proportional to 1/plx^4.

So that would make option A the correct answer.

Wait, but I thought in some of my earlier thinking, the answer was 1/plx^3. Maybe I'm missing a factor here.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the volume element. Let me think: the volume between plx and plx + dplx is 4π r^2 dr, where r = 1/plx. So, dr is in terms of plx.

But another way: the volume element in terms of plx is (dV) = 4π (r)^2 dr = 4π (1/plx)^2 ( - (1/plx^2) dplx )

So, dV = -4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

But because dV is positive, perhaps I should take the absolute value, so dV = 4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

Thus, the number of stars is n * 4π (1/plx^4) dplx. So, the number per unit plx is proportional to 1/plx^4.

So the answer should be option A.

But wait, I'm a bit confused because I've heard before that the number of stars per unit parallax interval (dN/dplx) is proportional to 1/plx^3. But according to my calculation here, it's 1/plx^4. Hmm, so maybe I made a mistake.

Let me try this again. Parallax plx = 1/d, where d is distance.

The number of stars with parallax between plx and plx + dplx is the number of stars in the shell of radius d to d + dd, where dd is the corresponding change in distance.

But when plx increases by dplx, d decreases by a small amount because d = 1/plx → dd = - d^2 dplx.

So, the volume of this shell is 4π d² dd = 4π d² (-d^2 dplx) ) → 4π d^4 (-dplx). But wait, that can't be right because d^4 would be part of it, but if d is 1/plx, then d^4 = (1/plx)^4, and dplx is positive.

Wait, maybe I should express everything in terms of plx.

d = 1/plx → dd = - (1/plx²) dplx.

The volume element is 4π d² dd = 4π (1/plx)^2 (-1/plx²) dplx ) = -4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

Taking absolute value, the volume is 4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

So, number of stars is n * 4π (1/plx^4) dplx → so dN = (4π n / plx^4) dplx.

Therefore, the number per unit plx is 4π n / plx^4, which is option A.

But wait, I've heard elsewhere that the number of stars per unit parallax interval is inversely proportional to plx cubed. Maybe I'm missing a factor because of the solid angle or something else.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the number in a range of distance versus parallax. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: The number of stars in a thin shell between plx and plx + dplx is N dN = n * volume of shell.

Volume of shell is 4π (r)^2 dr, where r = 1/plx, and dr = (dr/d plx) * dplx = (-1/plx²) dplx.

So, volume = 4π (1/plx)^2 * (1/plx²) dplx → 4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

So, dN = n * 4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

Which again leads to the result that the number per unit plx is proportional to 1/plx^4.

So, the correct answer would be option A, ~1/plx^4.

But I'm a bit confused because I remember that the flux from stars (like in the inverse square law) falls off as 1/d^2, but that's flux, not the number of stars.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the calculation of the volume element. Let me double-check.

Volume between two spheres of radius r and r + dr is 4π r² dr.

Expressed in terms of plx, where r = 1/plx, so dr = - (1/plx²) dplx.

So, substituting:

4π r² dr = 4π (1/plx)^2 * (-1/plx²) dplx → 4π (1/plx^4) (-dplx).

The negative indicates that as plx increases (d decreases), the volume element is positive. So the magnitude is 4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

So, the number of stars in this range is n * 4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

Hence, the number per unit plx is proportional to 1/plx^4.

So, the correct answer is A) ~ 1/plx^4.

The question asks how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, assuming stars are uniformly distributed in space. Parallax is inversely related to distance, such that \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \), where \( d \) is the distance to the star. The goal is to determine the dependence of the number of stars per unit parallax range on \( \text{plx} \).

To solve this, we consider the number of stars in a thin shell between parallax values \( \text{plx} \) and \( \text{plx} + d\text{plx} \). The volume of this shell is proportional to \( 4\pi r^2 dr \), where \( r \) is the distance corresponding to the parallax. Since \( r = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \), the volume element can be expressed in terms of \( \text{plx} \). Taking the derivative \( dr = -\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d\text{plx} \), the volume element becomes:

\[
dV = 4\pi r^2 dr = 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{\text{plx}}\right)^2 \left(-\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d\text{plx}\right) = -\frac{4\pi}{\text{plx}^4} d\text{plx}.
\]

The negative sign indicates the direction of change, but we are interested in the magnitude. Thus, the volume element is:

\[
dV = \frac{4\pi}{\text{plx}^4} d\text{plx}.
\]

The number of stars in this volume element is proportional to the volume, as the number density of stars \( n \) is constant. Therefore, the number of stars per unit parallax range is:

\[
\frac{dN}{d\text{plx}} = n \cdot \frac{4\pi}{\text{plx}^4}.
\]

This shows that the number of stars per unit parallax range decreases as \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} \).

From the given options:

- **A) ~ \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} \):** Matches the derived result.
- **B) ~ \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} \):** Incorrect, as the dependence is stronger than \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} \).
- **C) ~ \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^1} \):** Incorrect, as the dependence is stronger than \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \).
- **D) ~ \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^3} \):** Incorrect, as the dependence is \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} \), not \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^3} \).

Thus, the correct answer is **A**, as the number of stars per unit parallax range decreases as \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} \).

Answer: A
