Okay, so I've got this question about neutrinos from the Sun, and I'm supposed to figure out the ratio of their fluxes in two different energy bands after a certain reaction stops. Hmm, let's think through this step by step.

First, I remember that the Sun's energy production involves several processes, particularly the proton-proton (pp) chains. The question mentions the pp-III branch stopping. I think the pp chain has multiple branches, like pp-I, pp-II, pp-III, each producing neutrinos of different energies.

Wait, so the pp-III branch is responsible for producing higher-energy neutrinos, right? Because I recall that the main pp-I branch produces lower-energy neutrinos, around 200-300 keV, and pp-III produces higher ones, like 500-800 keV or so. Oh, but wait, the bands in the question are 700-800 (band 1) and 800-900 (band 2). So band 1 is in the range that pp-III contributes to, and band 2 is a bit higher.

If the pp-III branch stops, then the production of neutrinos in that higher energy range would stop. But wait, the question says that the pp-III branch stopped 8.5 minutes ago. Since neutrinos travel at light speed, which takes about 8 minutes to get from the Sun to Earth, the neutrinos emitted from the Sun's core take that time to reach us. So, if the pp-III stopped 8.5 minutes ago, the neutrinos from that process that were emitted before the stoppage would still be arriving now. But new neutrinos from pp-III won't be produced anymore.

Wait, but the question is about the flux now. Flux is the number of neutrinos per cm² per second. So, if the pp-III stopped, then the production of those neutrinos has ceased, but the existing ones are still on their way. However, neutrinos don't pile up in space because they're moving at light speed and the Sun is not that much bigger than the distance to Earth. So the flux we receive now is from neutrinos emitted in the last 8.5 minutes.

Wait no, that's not right. The Sun's core emits neutrinos, and since neutrinos move at nearly the speed of light, the neutrinos emitted today would arrive in about 8.5 minutes. But if the pp-III stopped 8.5 minutes ago, then the last pp-III neutrinos were emitted 8.5 minutes ago. Since it takes 8.5 minutes to reach Earth, those neutrinos are just arriving now. So the flux from pp-III neutrinos would drop to almost zero because no new ones are being produced.

Wait, but what about the other branches? The question says all other reactions remained as they were. So the pp-I and pp-II, or whatever else is producing lower-energy neutrinos, are still active. But wait, the pp-III is the main one for higher energy neutrinos, perhaps.

Wait, the pp chain consists of two main pathways: the dominant pp-I and the less significant pp-II and pp-III. The pp-I branch produces lower-energy neutrinos, like around 1 MeV, but wait, no, that's not right. Wait, the main pp chain produces neutrinos in the ~200-300 keV range. The pp-III branch produces higher-energy ones, perhaps around 500-800 keV or so. So if pp-III is stopped, then the production of those higher-energy neutrinos would stop.

So what's the flux in band 1 (700-800 keV) and band 2 (800-900 keV)? Well, band 1 is in the range of pp-III. So without pp-III, the number of neutrinos in band 1 would drop. But wait, the neutrinos from pp-III may have a range. Let me think: if pp-III produces neutrinos with energies up to maybe 800 keV, then the flux in 700-800 would be from pp-III. But what about higher than 800, like 800-900? Maybe those are from other processes, like the decay of heavier elements in the sun or other reactions.

Wait, but the main neutrino sources in the Sun are the pp chain and the CNO cycle. The CNO cycle produces higher-energy neutrinos, but I think they're around 1-2 MeV. So the 800-900 keV band is probably part of the CNO neutrinos? Or maybe the high-energy tail of the pp-III neutrinos.

Wait, I'm a bit confused here. Let me think again. The pp chain produces lower-energy neutrinos, while the CNO cycle, which happens in hotter, denser regions of the Sun, produces higher-energy neutrinos. So the CNO neutrinos are around a few MeV, higher than the pp chain's.

So if the pp-III branch is stopped, the production of neutrinos in the 700-800 keV band (band 1) would stop, but the 800-900 keV (band 2) would be from CNO or perhaps other branches.

Wait, but the CNO neutrinos are higher energy, so if band 2 is 800-900, that's lower than the typical CNO. Hmm. So maybe the CNO neutrinos are around 1-2 MeV, so band 2 may not be in their main range. Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III produces up to a certain point, and the CNO takes over beyond that.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the energy distribution. The pp chain's main neutrinos are around 200-300 keV. The pp-III branch, which is a minor part of the pp chain, produces higher-energy neutrinos, perhaps up to ~800 keV. Then, the CNO neutrinos start around 1 MeV and go higher.

So if the pp-III branch stops, the 700-800 keV band (band 1) would lose a significant source. But the 800-900 keV band (band 2) might either have contributions from CNO or perhaps some other processes. Alternatively, maybe the higher end of pp-III is near 800 keV, so stopping pp-III would remove some of the neutrinos in band 2 as well.

Wait, but the question is about the ratio of flux in band 1 to band 2. So if pp-III stops, band 1's flux would drop, but what about band 2's?

Wait, the CNO neutrinos would still be around, so band 2 would have CNO neutrinos. But if the pp-III only contributes a small amount to band 2, then the flux in band 2 wouldn't change much. Alternatively, if the pp-III was the main source for band 2, then the flux in band 2 would drop as well.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think about the energy ranges again. If the pp-III produces a certain maximum energy, say 800 keV, then the neutrinos from pp-III would peak around that and have a lower number beyond that. So the 700-800 keV band (band 1) would get neutrinos mainly from pp-III. The 800-900 keV (band 2) would get some from pp-III (if it has a high-energy tail) and possibly some from other sources like CNO.

But if the pp-III stops, then the flux in band 1 would drop to nearly zero, and the flux in band 2 might drop by a smaller amount, depending on whether pp-III contributes to band 2.

Wait, but the CNO neutrinos are higher energy, so maybe in band 2, the main source is CNO. So if pp-III stops, band 1's flux would drop, but band 2's flux would remain the same because it's from CNO.

But wait, the question is about 'the solar neutrino flavor changes happen, but do not play a role here.' So we don't have to worry about oscillations affecting the energies we see.

So, if pp-III stops, the flux from pp-III neutrinos in band 1 (700-800) stops, but the CNO neutrinos in band 2 (800-900) are still coming. So the flux in band 1 would drop, while flux in band 2 remains the same.

Wait, but how much of each band comes from pp-III versus other sources.

I think the majority of the flux in the 700-800 keV band is from pp-III, while the 800-900 keV may be from CNO. So if pp-III stops, band 1's flux drops, and band 2's remains (assuming CNO is not affected).

So the ratio (flux band1 / band2) would be (nearly zero) / (unchanged) ≈ 0. So the ratio is 0. But that's not one of the options. Hmm.

Wait, the options are 10, 0.01, 1, 0.1.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe the pp-III neutrinos are a minor component of the total flux, but I don't think so. The pp-III is a branch of the pp chain, which is the dominant source of solar neutrinos.

Wait, another approach: the pp chain produces neutrinos with energies around 0.3 MeV (300 keV), but the pp-III branch produces higher-energy neutrinos. So originally, when the pp-III is active, the flux in band 1 and band 2 might both have contributions from pp-III and possibly other sources.

If pp-III stops, the flux in band 1 (which is dominated by pp-III) would drop, but the flux in band 2 would drop only if pp-III contributes to it. Alternatively, perhaps the CNO neutrinos (like the 8B neutrinos) are in the 800 keV range. Wait, the 8B neutrinos have an energy around 15-18 MeV, which is way higher than 800 keV. So maybe I'm wrong about CNO neutrinos being in band 2.

Wait, perhaps another source: the decay of heavier elements or other processes. Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the energy ranges.

Alternatively, maybe the pp-III neutrinos have a spectrum that extends into band 2. So if pp-III stops, both bands would see a drop in flux, but band 1 more so than band 2.

Wait, but let's think about the neutrino energy spectrum. The pp-III branch produces neutrinos with energies up to around 700-800 keV. So band 1 is within this range, and band 2 (800-900) is just beyond. So without pp-III, the flux in band 1 would drop, but the flux in band 2 would depend on whether other processes contribute.

If the main source for band 2 is the same as band 1 (i.e., pp-III), then stopping pp-III would cause both to drop, but perhaps not in the same way.

Alternatively, maybe the pp-III neutrinos have a higher flux in band 1 than in band 2. So the ratio would change.

Wait, but let's think about the fluxes. Before the pp-III stops, the flux in band 1 is higher than band 2 because pp-III produces more in that lower range, and the higher range (band 2) might have less. Or maybe the opposite.

Alternatively, perhaps the neutrino flux from the Sun peaks in the lower energies, so band 1 has a higher flux than band 2.

Wait, but the pp-III neutrinos may have an energy distribution that drops off with higher energy. So if band 1 is 700-800 and band 2 is 800-900, the flux in band 1 would be higher than in band 2, as it's the higher end of pp-III.

So in the normal case, flux1 > flux2. So the ratio is flux1/flux2 > 1. But if pp-III stops, then flux1 drops to almost zero, while flux2 may drop a little as well. So the ratio would be (flux1 stops) / (flux2 stops a bit) — but perhaps it's the opposite.

Wait, this is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I should think about the fact that the pp-III branch is responsible for a small fraction of the total neutrinos.

Wait, the dominant source of solar neutrinos is the pp chain, especially the pp-I branch. The pp-III is a minor branch. So stopping the pp-III branch would reduce the total neutrino flux, but not eliminate it.

But the question is about the ratio between two specific bands. So, when the pp-III is stopped, the neutrinos in band 1 (700-800) would have their source removed. If the neutrinos in band 2 (800-900) come from a different process, such as the CNO cycle, then their flux would remain the same.

But wait, the CNO cycle produces higher-energy neutrinos than the pp chain. So if the CNO neutrinos are in the 1-2 MeV range, band 2 (800-900 keV) is just below that. So maybe the CNO neutrinos don't contribute much to band 2. So perhaps band 2's neutrinos are also from the pp chain, but perhaps the pp-I branch?

Wait, this is getting confusing. Let's try to outline what I know.

- pp chain produces lower-energy neutrinos (~200 keV).
- pp-III is a branch that produces higher-energy neutrinos, perhaps up to 800 keV.
- CNO produces around 1 MeV and higher.

So, if pp-III stopped, the neutrinos in band 1 (700-800) would have their main source removed, so flux1 would drop. Band 2 (800-900) might have some contributions from the pp-I branch or other processes, but perhaps less. Alternatively, if the pp-I branch doesn't contribute to that range, then the flux2 would also drop, but maybe not as much as flux1.

Wait, perhaps the pp-I neutrinos are around 200-300 keV, so they don't contribute to either band. So if the pp-III is the only source for band 1 and band 2, then stopping pp-III would cause both flux1 and flux2 to drop, but how?

Wait, but what's the typical energy distribution of the pp-III neutrinos. Do they extend up to 800 keV, and then band 2 is beyond that? So if the pp-III neutrinos have a distribution that peaks below 800 keV, the flux in band 2 (800-900) would be much lower than band 1.

So when pp-III is active, the flux in band 1 is higher than in band 2. So the ratio is flux1/flux2 = say, 10.

Wait, that's option A. But what happens when pp-III stops? Then, flux1 would drop to zero (assuming no other sources), and flux2 would also drop if the pp-III was contributing. But if the pp-III contributes more to band1 than band2, then after stopping, the ratio of (flux1)/(flux2) would be (0)/(something small) which is zero, but that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the other way: the pp-III neutrinos are the only source for band1 and a minor source for band2. So when pp-III stops, band1's flux drops to zero, while band2's flux remains (if it's from another source, like CNO). So the ratio becomes 0.000... But again, that's not an option.

Wait, but maybe the question is asking for the ratio before and after the pp-III stops. Oh, no, the question states the pp-III stopped 8.5 minutes ago, so the fluxes we're looking at now are the result of that stoppage.

So, if the pp-III was providing a significant portion of the neutrinos in band1 and a smaller portion in band2, then the flux in band1 would drop more than band2. So the ratio (flux1/flux2) would drop.

Wait, for example, if originally, flux1 was 10 times flux2, and after stopping, flux1 becomes zero and flux2 remains at its original level (if it's from another source), then the new ratio is 0. But that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III contributes a small fraction to flux2, so the ratio after stopping would be (flux1_ppIII)/(flux2_ppIII + flux2_other). If flux2_other is negligible, then the ratio would drop to zero.

But maybe the question is about the change in the ratio. Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III is the main contributor to both bands, but more so for band1.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me try to think differently.

If pp-III stopped, then the neutrinos from that process stop. So, the neutrinos in band1, which are in the pp-III range, would be affected more. So the flux in band1 would drop, while flux in band2 (if from another source) would remain the same.

So, let's say that without pp-III, the flux in band1 becomes zero and band2 remains at its original level. Then the ratio (band1/band2) would be zero, but that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III neutrinos contribute a small part to both bands, but more to band1. So when it stops, band1 loses more, and the ratio decreases.

Wait, but the options are A:10, B:0.01, C:1, D:0.1.

Another approach: the number of neutrinos in a band depends on the production rate and the energy spectrum. The pp-III neutrinos have a certain energy distribution. So, the flux in each band is the integral of the number of neutrinos with energies in that band.

If the pp-III neutrinos are the main source of both bands, then stopping them would reduce both, but the ratio depends on how their distribution falls in the bands.

Assume that the pp-III neutrinos have a spectrum that peaks around 700 keV. So, the flux in band1 (700-800) is higher than in band2 (800-900), which is the tail.

So, when pp-III is active, flux1 > flux2, so ratio is greater than 1. When pp-III stops, both flux1 and flux2 drop, but flux1 was already much higher. But if the question is about the new ratio, then if the only source is stopped, flux1 and flux2 both drop, but perhaps the ratio remains the same if both are entirely from pp-III.

Wait, but if the pp-III is the only source, then both bands would drop together, keeping the same ratio. But if other sources contribute to band2, then the ratio would change.

Hmm, perhaps the pp-III neutrinos are the main source for band1 and a minor source for band2, while other processes contribute to band2. So when pp-III stops, band1's flux drops to zero, and band2's flux is now from other sources.

In that case, the ratio (flux1/flux2) would be zero. But that's not an option. So perhaps that's not the right way to approach it.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the neutrino energies and the processes.

The dominant neutrinos from the Sun are the pp chain, which produces ~200 keV neutrinos. The pp-III branch produces higher energy neutrinos, say up to 800 keV. The CNO cycle produces much higher energy neutrinos, around 1-2 MeV.

So, if the pp-III stopped, then the neutrinos in band1 (700-800) would have their main source removed, leading to a significant drop in flux1. The neutrinos in band2 (800-900) would not be affected as much, because those are not produced by the pp-III process, but perhaps by the CNO cycle. Wait, but CNO neutrinos are higher than 800, so maybe band2 doesn't have a strong source.

Wait, perhaps the CNO neutrinos are above 800, so band2 (800-900) would have less, but perhaps the CNO neutrinos are in the 1-2 MeV range, which is higher than band2. So perhaps the main neutrinos in band2 are from the pp-III process.

If that's the case, then stopping pp-III would remove all neutrinos in band1 and a significant portion of band2.

So, originally, both band1 and band2 have high flux due to pp-III, but band1 is lower than band2 because the pp-III spectrum peaks higher.

Wait, no. If the pp-III neutrinos have a distribution that is higher than 700 keV, then band1 (700-800) would have more neutrinos than band2 (800-900), because the number drops off with higher energy. So, the flux in band1 would be higher than band2.

If pp-III stops, then both flux1 and flux2 drop, but since flux1 was higher, the ratio (flux1/flux2) would be similar to before if the drop is proportional.

Wait, but if pp-III is the main source for both bands, then the ratio would remain the same. So if before the stoppage, the ratio was around 10, it would stay around 10 after the stoppage because both have dropped by the same proportion. But without pp-III, the fluxes in both bands would drop, but their ratio would remain the same as before.

Wait, but if pp-III is the only source for both bands, then when it stops, both flux1 and flux2 become zero, so the ratio is undefined. But that's not the case because the question says other reactions remain the same.

Wait, the other reactions (like pp-I and CNO) continue. So, the neutrinos from those would affect the flux in the bands.

Assuming that the pp-I produces neutrinos around 200-300 keV, which don't contribute to bands 1 and 2. The CNO produces neutrinos around 1-2 MeV, higher than band2. So, band2 (800-900) would have very few neutrinos from CNO.

Wait, then which sources contribute to band2? If pp-III is the main contributor, and CNO doesn't contribute much, and pp-I doesn't contribute to either bands, then when pp-III stops, both bands' fluxes drop to zero. But that's not the case because the question says other reactions (like pp-I) continue, but perhaps they don't contribute to these bands.

So, if all other reactions continue but don't contribute to bands 1 and 2, then stopping pp-III would cause both flux1 and flux2 to drop, but their ratio would depend on how much pp-III contributed to each.

Wait, perhaps the pp-III neutrinos have a distribution that is higher in band1 than band2. So, if the pp-III is the main source, then the ratio (flux1/flux2) would be greater than 1. If pp-III stops, but nothing else contributes, then both fluxes drop to zero, but the ratio would be undefined. But since the question allows for other reactions, perhaps they do contribute a little.

Alternatively, perhaps the CNO neutrinos are around 15 MeV, so no contribution to band2. So, the only source for band2 is pp-III.

So, in that case, without pp-III, both bands' fluxes drop, but their ratio would be zero, which isn't an option.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the main point: the pp-III neutrinos are higher energy, so band1 is 700-800, band2 is 800-900. If the pp-III stopped, then the neutrinos in these bands would have their main source removed. So, the flux in both bands would drop, but the drop would be more significant in band1 if the pp-III neutrinos are more numerous there.

So, the ratio (flux1/flux2) would be higher than 1 before the stoppage, and perhaps similar after, but that doesn't fit the options.

Wait, maybe I should think about the energy distribution. The pp-III neutrinos have a spectrum that falls off with energy. So, the number of neutrinos in band1 (700-800) is higher than in band2 (800-900). So, the ratio is about 10:1 (flux1 is 10 times flux2). So, the answer would be option A:10.

But wait, the question is about what happens after the pp-III stops. Before stopping, the ratio was 10. After stopping, the pp-III neutrinos stop, so flux1 and flux2 both drop. But if other processes contribute to flux2, then the ratio might decrease.

Alternatively, perhaps the other processes (like CNO) contribute a small amount to band2. So, when the pp-III stops, flux1 drops to zero, but flux2 remains at a small value. Thus, the ratio becomes zero, which isn't an option.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III neutrinos contribute more to band1 than band2. So, the ratio before stopping is 10. After stopping, the flux1 is zero, flux2 is non-zero. So the ratio is zero, which isn't an option. Thus, maybe I'm approaching this wrong.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the flux before and after. So, the ratio is (flux1 after)/(flux2 after). But without knowing the other sources, it's hard to tell.

Another angle: in the Sun, the number of neutrinos decreases with energy. So, the flux is highest at lower energies and falls off at higher energies. So, the flux in band1 is higher than in band2. So, flux1/flux2 is greater than 1. So, if the ratio is about 10, the answer would be A.

But the question is about what happens when pp-III stops. So, if the pp-III neutrinos are the main contributors to both bands, but more so for band1, then when pp-III stops, both fluxes drop, but the ratio remains the same. So, the ratio would still be around 10.

Wait, that makes sense. Because if the pp-III neutrinos are the only source for both bands, and their distribution is such that band1 has 10 times the flux of band2, stopping pp-III would cause both to drop, but the ratio would remain 10.

So the answer would be A)10.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves determining the ratio of neutrino fluxes in two energy bands, 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2), after the pp-III branch of the proton-proton chain in the Sun's core hypothetically stops. The pp-III branch is responsible for producing higher-energy neutrinos, typically up to around 800 keV, while the dominant pp-I branch produces lower-energy neutrinos (~200-300 keV). The CNO cycle, which produces higher-energy neutrinos (~1-2 MeV), does not contribute significantly to the energy ranges in question.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Energy Distribution of Neutrinos**:
   - The pp-III branch produces neutrinos with energies up to ~800 keV, contributing significantly to both band 1 (700-800 keV) and band 2 (800-900 keV). However, the flux decreases with increasing energy, meaning band 1 typically has a higher flux than band 2.
   - The CNO cycle produces neutrinos at much higher energies (~1-2 MeV), which are beyond the range of both bands, so it does not contribute significantly to either band.

2. **Impact of Stopping the pp-III Branch**:
   - If the pp-III branch stops, the production of neutrinos in the 700-800 keV range (band 1) is largely eliminated. Similarly, the flux in band 2 (800-900 keV) is also reduced, but to a lesser extent because the pp-III neutrinos contribute less to this higher-energy tail.

3. **Flux Ratio Before and After the Stoppage**:
   - Before the stoppage, the flux in band 1 is higher than in band 2 due to the energy distribution of the pp-III neutrinos. The ratio of flux1 to flux2 is approximately 10:1.
   - After the pp-III branch stops, both flux1 and flux2 drop significantly. However, the ratio of flux1 to flux2 remains approximately the same because the relative contributions of the pp-III neutrinos to the two bands are consistent.

### Conclusion:
The ratio of the fluxes in band 1 to band 2 remains approximately 10, as the pp-III neutrinos' energy distribution ensures that band 1 has a higher flux than band 2, even after the pp-III branch stops.
