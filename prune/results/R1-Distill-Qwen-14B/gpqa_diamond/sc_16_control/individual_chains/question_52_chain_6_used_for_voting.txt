Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's take it slow because I'm still a bit new to this.

The problem is about a star with certain characteristics and how the presence of dark spots affects the ratio of neutral Titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels. Hmm, alright. Let me break down the information given.

So, the star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. Without spots, the effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Interesting. I remember that when stars have spots, those spots are cooler than the surrounding photosphere, which can affect the overall luminosity. Oh wait, but how does that tie into the temperature affecting the ratio of atomic energy levels?

The question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels, level 1 and level 2. When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. I need to find the factor by which this ratio changes—so, ratio without spots divided by ratio with spots.

I recall that in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the number of atoms in different energy levels can be described by the Boltzmann equation. The equation is N2/N1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k*T) ), where g's are the statistical weights, E's are the energies, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is temperature.

Wait, the ratio N1/N2 would be the inverse of that. But in the problem, the observed ratio (N1/N2) decreases when the star has spots. So when the star has spots, N1/N2 is smaller than when it doesn't. So the ratio when no spots (R1) divided by ratio with spots (R2) would be R1/R2 = (N1/N2)_no_spots / (N1/N2)_with_spots.

But wait, the problem says that when the star has spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature is 5500 K. But how does that tie into the temperature of the spots versus the surrounding? Oh wait, the problem states that the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases. So the average temperature of the photosphere is lower when spots are present.

Wait, but the star's photosphere is in LTE, so each region (spot and non-spot) is in LTE. But the problem seems to consider the overall photosphere as being at 5500 K when spots are present. So perhaps we're to model the entire photosphere as being at 5500 K when spots are there, and 6000 K when not.

Wait, but the spots are cooler, so the overall Teff is lower. So the star emits less total flux because 40% of its surface is at a lower temperature. But the problem gives us the effective temperatures as 6000 K without spots and 5500 K with spots. Wait, that's an average? Because the star's total luminosity would be the sum of the contributions from the spotted and unspotted regions. But the effective temperature is a measure of the total luminosity per surface area, so T_eff^4 is proportional to L/(4πR²). So when 40% is covered, the total luminosity would be 0.6*(sigma* (6000)^4 ) * surface area + 0.4*(sigma*(T_spot)^4 ) * surface area. But the problem states that the overall T_eff is 5500 K, so the 5500 K is the effective temperature when considering the entire star as a blackbody with that T.

Hmm, but the question is about the photosphere. So perhaps the average temperature of the photosphere is 5500 K when spots are present. So the problem is assuming that the photosphere's temperature is 5500 K in the presence of spots, and 6000 K otherwise.

Wait, but wait. The effective temperature is the temperature a blackbody of the same radius would have to emit the same total flux. So it's a global property. So when spots are present, the star emits less flux, so the effective temperature (which is calculated from the total flux) goes down.

But in the photosphere, which parts are hotter and which are cooler? The spots are cooler, so the rest of the surface (60%) is at 6000 K when spots are present. Or wait, wait no: without spots, the entire surface is 6000 K. When spots are present, 40% is at a lower temperature (T_spot), and 60% remains at 6000 K. But the problem says that the effective temperature (which is an average) is 5500 K. So perhaps the average T is 5500 K, but the photosphere is a mix of 6000 K and T_spot.

But the question says, when 40% is covered, the overall photospheric Teff is 5500 K. Hmm, perhaps the problem is simplifying things, and considering the entire photosphere as at 5500 K when spots are present, but that might not be accurate. Alternatively, maybe the temperature of the photosphere (the unspotted parts) remains the same, but the spots cause a lower overall effective temperature. But I'm not sure. Let me think again.

Wait, the problem says "the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500 K." Hmm, I think the photospheric effective temperature is the T_eff of the star as a whole, so it's the average. So when there are spots, the star's overall photosphere, when measured by T_eff, is 5500 K. But the actual local temperatures are different: the unspotted parts are still 6000 K, and the spotted parts are lower. But the problem is perhaps treating the entire photosphere as being at 5500 K? Or perhaps it's the average temperature over the surface.

Wait, but in the context of the question, when looking at the ratio of Ti atoms in different energy levels, we're considering the photosphere. So if the effective temperature is lower, but the actual local temperature varies, do we model the photosphere as having a temperature of 5500 K, or as having a mix of 6000 K and lower temperatures?

Wait, the problem states that the photosphere is in LTE. So each region is in LTE. So when spots are present, the photosphere is a mix of regions at 6000 K and spots at some lower temperature. But because the problem is looking at the photosphere as a whole, perhaps the observed ratio is an average of the ratios from the different regions.

But wait, the problem says that when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature is 5500 K. So perhaps the problem is considering the entire photosphere as being at 5500 K when spots are present. That's a bit confusing because, in reality, the star's photosphere would have regions at different temperatures, but the problem might be simplifying.

Wait, but the question is about the ratio of Ti atoms in two energy levels. The ratio depends on the temperature, as per the Boltzmann factor. If the photosphere's temperature is lower when spots are present, then the ratio would change accordingly.

So, let me focus on the ratio. The ratio N1/N2 is proportional to exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) ). Because N1/N2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) )^-1, wait no—wait. The Boltzmann distribution is N2/N1 = (g2/g1) exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) ). So N1/N2 = (g1/g2) exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) ).

Wait, but the problem states that when the star has spots, the ratio N1/N2 decreases. So N1/N2 is lower when spots are present, which means lower T.

Because E2 is higher than E1 (since it's an energy level transition), so E2 - E1 is positive. So if T decreases, the exponent (E2 - E1)/(k T) increases, making exp() larger. So N1/N2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) ) would increase as T decreases. Wait, but according to the problem, when spots are present, the ratio decreases. That would imply that N1/N2 is lower when T is lower?

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me re-express the ratio.

Suppose we have two energy levels, level 1 and level 2, where E2 > E1.

The ratio N1/N2 is given by (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) ).

So, when T increases, the exponent (E2-E1)/(k T) decreases, so exp(...) decreases, making N1/N2 decrease. So higher T leads to lower N1/N2. Lower T leads to higher N1/N2.

But according to the problem, when the star has spots, the ratio N1/N2 decreases. So N1/N2 with spots (e.g., N1/N2)_spot is lower than without spots. So that would suggest that (N1/N2)_no_spot / (N1/N2)_spot = [ (g1/g2) e^{(E2-E1)/(k T_no)} ] / [ (g1/g2) e^{(E2-E1)/(k T_spot)} } ] = e^{ [ (E2-E1)/(k T_no) - (E2-E1)/(k T_spot) ) ] }.

Wait, wait. So when there are spots, the photosphere's temperature is lower. So T_spot = 5500 K, and T_no = 6000 K. So when calculating the ratio, N1/N2 with and without spots.

But wait, the problem says that when the star has spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature is 5500 K. So we're assuming the photosphere as a whole is at 5500 K when spots are present. But earlier, I thought the photosphere would have a mix of temperatures.

Wait, but the problem says that when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric Teff is 5500 K. So perhaps the entire photosphere is now at 5500 K. Or maybe it's a mix, but the problem considers the photosphere's temperature as 5500 K in that case. Hmm, but that seems a bit conflicting because the spots are cooler regions.

Wait, perhaps the problem is simplifying and treating the entire photosphere as being at 5500 K when spots are present. So the effective temperature of the photosphere, the average, is 5500 K. Therefore, for the purpose of this problem, when spots are present, the temperature is 5500 K, and without spots it's 6000 K.

So, the ratio N1/N2 is proportional to exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) ). Let me denote this as:

Ratio = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) )

But the problem says that the ratio decreases when spots are present. So without spots, T=6000 K; with spots, T=5500 K.

Wait, but according to the formula, if T decreases (from 6000 to 5500), the exponent (E2-E1)/(k T) would increase, because T is smaller. So exp(...) increases, so the ratio N1/N2 increases. But the problem says that when there are spots, the ratio decreases. Hmm, that's a contradiction, so perhaps I got the ratio backwards.

Wait, wait. Let's think again. N2/N1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) )

So, N1/N2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) )

So, if T decreases, the exponent (E2-E1)/(k T) increases, so the exponential term increases, making N1/N2 larger. So, if T decreases, N1/N2 increases.

But the problem states that when the star has spots, the ratio N1/N2 decreases. That would imply that when T is lower, N1/N2 is lower. Which contradicts the formula unless my reasoning is wrong.

Hmm, maybe I have the ratio backward. Perhaps the problem is considering N2/N1 instead of N1/N2. Let me check the question again.

The problem says, "the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energetic levels (level 1 and level 2)", which is observed to decrease when the star has spots. So, which ratio are they referring to? It could be either N1/N2 or N2/N1.

Suppose the ratio they're considering is N2/N1. Then the ratio would be (g2/g1) exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) )

In that case, when T decreases, the exponent -(E2-E1)/(k T) becomes a larger negative number, so exp() becomes smaller, making N2/N1 decrease. So when T decreases, N2/N1 decreases. Thus, the ratio N2/N1 would be lower when the star has spots, which matches the problem statement.

Ah, so perhaps the question is about N2/N1. But the question says, "the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energetic levels (level 1 and level 2)". So, it's not clear which way the ratio is taken. But the problem states that this ratio decreases when the star has spots.

If the ratio is N2/N1, then when T decreases, N2/N1 decreases, which aligns with the problem statement. So the ratio is N2/N1.

So, the factor by which the ratio changes is (N2/N1)_no_spots / (N2/N1)_with_spots.

Which would be [ (g2/g1) exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T_no) ) ] / [ (g2/g1) exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T_spot) ) ]

The g2/g1 terms cancel out, so we're left with exp( (E2-E1)/(k) [ 1/(T_spot) - 1/(T_no) ] )

Wait, no: let me compute it correctly.

(N2/N1)_no_spots = (g2/g1) exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T_no) )

(N2/N1)_with_spots = (g2/g1) exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T_spot) )

So the ratio is [ (g2/g1) exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T_no) ) ] / [ (g2/g1) exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T_spot) ) ]

Which simplifies to exp [ (E2 - E1)/(k) (1/(T_spot) - 1/(T_no) ) ]

Wait, wait:

Because:

exp(a) / exp(b) = exp(a - b)

So, [ exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T_no) ) ] / [ exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T_spot) ) ] = exp( [ -(E2-E1)/(k T_no) + (E2-E1)/(k T_spot) ] )

Factor out (E2-E1)/k:

= exp( (E2-E1)/k [ 1/(T_spot) - 1/(T_no) ] )

Wait, that's because:

-(E2-E1)/(k T_no) + (E2-E1)/(k T_spot) = (E2-E1)/k [ 1/(T_spot) - 1/(T_no) ]

But (E2-E1) is positive, so let's compute the exponent.

Now, given that T_spot is 5500 K and T_no is 6000 K.

So 1/(T_spot) is approximately 1/5500 ≈ 1.818e-4 K^-1

1/(T_no) ≈ 1/6000 ≈ 1.667e-4 K^-1

So 1/(5500) - 1/(6000) = (6000 - 5500) / (5500 * 6000) ) ) = 500 / (33,000,000) ) = 5e2 / 3.3e7 = approx 1.515e-5 K^-1.

But wait, 1/5500 is about 1.818e-4, 1/6000 is about 1.667e-4. Subtracting, 1.818e-4 - 1.667e-4 = 0.151e-4 = 1.51e-5 K^-1.

So the exponent is (E2-E1)/(k) * (1.51e-5) )

But we don't know E2-E1. But the question gives the wavelength of the transition as approximately 1448 Å. Hmm, that's about 144.8 nm, which is in the far ultraviolet.

The energy of a photon is given by E = hc / λ. So E2 - E1 = hc/λ.

So let's compute E2 - E1.

h is Planck's constant = 6.626e-34 J·s

c is speed of light = 3e8 m/s

λ = 1448 Å = 1448e-10 m = 1.448e-7 m.

So E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1.448e-7) = (1.9878e-25) / (1.448e-7) ) = approx 1.372e-18 J.

But that's in Joules. Let's convert that to eV since k is often expressed in eV.

1 eV = 1.602e-19 J.

So E = 1.372e-18 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 8.56 eV.

So E2 - E1 ≈ 8.56 eV.

Now, Boltzmann's constant k is 8.617e-5 eV/K.

So (E2-E1)/(k) = 8.56 eV / (8.617e-5 eV/K) ≈ 8.56 / 8.617e-5 ≈ approx 99300 K.

Wait, wait, 8.56 / 8.617e-5 is equal to (8.56 / 8.617) * 1e5 ≈ (approx 0.993) * 1e5 ≈ 99300 K.

So the exponent is (E2-E1)/(k) * (1.51e-5 K^-1) )

Which is 99300 K * 1.51e-5 1/K = 99300 * 1.51e-5.

Calculating that:

99300 * 1e-5 = 0.993

0.993 * 1.51 ≈ 1.5.

So the exponent is approximately 1.5.

Wait, 99300 * 1.51e-5 = 99300 * 0.0000151.

Hmm, let's calculate that more accurately.

99300 * 0.0000151 = ?

Well, 1e5 * 0.0000151 = 1.51, so 99300 is 99.3% of 1e5. So 0.993 * 1.51 ≈ 1.5.

Wait, 99300 * 1.51e-5 = 99300 * 0.0000151 = ?

99300 * 0.0000151 = (99300 * 1.51) * 1e-5.

99300 * 1.51 = approx 99300 * 1.5 = 148,950, plus 99300 * 0.01 = 993, so total approx 149,943.

Multiply by 1e-5: 149,943e-5 = 1.49943.

Approximately 1.5.

So the exponent is ~1.5.

So the factor is exp(1.5) ≈ e^1.5.

e^1 is about 2.718, e^0.5 is about 1.6487. So e^1.5 ≈ 2.718 * 1.6487 ≈ 4.48.

Wait, 2.718 * 1.6487 ≈ 4.48.

Hmm, so the ratio (N2/N1)_no_spots / (N2/N1)_with_spots is exp(1.5) ≈ 4.48.

So approximately 4.5.

Looking at the options, option C is ~4.5.

So the factor is about 4.5.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the factor by which the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels changes when the star transitions from no spots to having spots, we use the Boltzmann distribution. The ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels is given by:

\[
\frac{N_2}{N_1} = \frac{g_2}{g_1} \exp\left(-\frac{E_2 - E_1}{kT}\right)
\]

where \(g_1\) and \(g_2\) are the statistical weights, \(E_2 - E_1\) is the energy difference between the levels, \(k\) is Boltzmann's constant, and \(T\) is the temperature. The problem specifies that the ratio decreases when the star has spots, so we are analyzing the factor by which the ratio changes as the temperature drops from \(T_{\text{no spots}} = 6000 \, \text{K}\) to \(T_{\text{spots}} = 5500 \, \text{K}\).

The factor by which the ratio changes is:

\[
\text{Factor} = \frac{\left(\frac{N_2}{N_1}\right)_{\text{no spots}}}{\left(\frac{N_2}{N_1}\right)_{\text{spots}}} = \exp\left(\frac{E_2 - E_1}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_{\text{spots}}} - \frac{1}{T_{\text{no spots}}}\right)\right)
\]

### Step 1: Compute the energy difference \(E_2 - E_1\)
The energy difference corresponds to the transition wavelength \(\lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å} = 1.448 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m}\). Using the relation \(E = \frac{hc}{\lambda}\), where \(h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}\) and \(c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}\):

\[
E_2 - E_1 = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3 \times 10^8)}{1.448 \times 10^{-7}} \approx 1.372 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J}
\]

Converting to electron volts (\(1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}\)):

\[
E_2 - E_1 \approx \frac{1.372 \times 10^{-18}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 8.56 \, \text{eV}
\]

### Step 2: Compute the temperature difference term
The temperatures are \(T_{\text{no spots}} = 6000 \, \text{K}\) and \(T_{\text{spots}} = 5500 \, \text{K}\). The term \(\frac{1}{T_{\text{spots}}} - \frac{1}{T_{\text{no spots}}}\) is:

\[
\frac{1}{T_{\text{spots}}} - \frac{1}{T_{\text{no spots}}} = \frac{1}{5500} - \frac{1}{6000} = \frac{6000 - 5500}{5500 \times 6000} = \frac{500}{33,000,000} \approx 1.51 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{K}^{-1}
\]

### Step 3: Compute the exponent
Using \(k = 8.617 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{eV/K}\), the exponent is:

\[
\frac{E_2 - E_1}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_{\text{spots}}} - \frac{1}{T_{\text{no spots}}}\right) = \frac{8.56}{8.617 \times 10^{-5}} \times 1.51 \times 10^{-5}
\]

First, compute \(\frac{8.56}{8.617 \times 10^{-5}}\):

\[
\frac{8.56}{8.617 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 99300 \, \text{K}
\]

Then multiply by \(1.51 \times 10^{-5}\):

\[
99300 \times 1.51 \times 10^{-5} \approx 1.5
\]

### Step 4: Compute the factor
The factor is:

\[
\text{Factor} = \exp(1.5) \approx 4.48
\]

### Conclusion
The factor by which the ratio changes is approximately \(4.5\), which corresponds to option **C**.
