Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC), and I'm supposed to find the energy when the speed of the nucleus is 0.96c. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to think it through.

First, let me parse the question. The nucleus in question is X, which is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium. So, lithium has an atomic number of 3, right? So Li-6 would have 3 protons and 3 neutrons. Because normally, lithium has 3 protons, and isotopes have varying neutrons. So, X is Li-6. Wait, but sometimes isotopes are denoted by their mass number. Li-6 would have 3 protons and 3 neutrons, so yeah, that makes sense. So the mass of the nucleus is the mass of a Li-6 nucleus.

I need to find the kinetic energy or the total energy? Wait, the question says "energy of the RHIC" so I think it's referring to the kinetic energy imparted to the nuclei, but sometimes in particle physics, the energy refers to the total energy, which includes rest mass. Hmm, I'll have to think about that.

Wait, the formula for relativistic energy. The total energy E is gamma times the rest mass energy, E = gamma * m c². The kinetic energy K is E minus the rest energy, so K = (gamma - 1) m c². So the question is, are they asking for the total energy or the kinetic energy? The problem says "the energy of the RHIC so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c." RHIC accelerators typically provide kinetic energy to the ions, but I'm not entirely sure. Hmm.

Wait, but the question doesn't specify kinetic or total, so maybe I should consider total energy. But I'll proceed and see.

First, I'll need to find the gamma factor. Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Since v is 0.96c, let's compute that.

v = 0.96c. So v² = (0.96)^2 c² = 0.9216 c². So v²/c² is 0.9216. Then 1 - v²/c² is 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of that is sqrt(0.0784). Let me calculate that. 0.0784 is 7.84e-2. The square root of 0.0784 is about 0.28, because 0.28^2 is 0.0784. So sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28. Therefore, gamma is 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.5714. Wait, because 0.28 is 7/25, so 1/0.28 is 25/7 ≈ 3.5714.

Wait, let me compute this more accurately. 0.28 squared is 0.0784, right. Wait, wait, 0.28 * 0.28 = 0.0784. So sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28. So gamma is 1/0.28 = approximately 3.5714.

So gamma is approx 3.5714.

But let me compute it more precisely. Let's do the calculation for gamma when v=0.96c.

v = 0.96c.

So beta = v/c = 0.96.

Gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.96^2).

Compute 0.96^2: 0.96 * 0.96 = (1 - 0.04)^2 = 1 - 0.08 + 0.0016 = 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28, so gamma is 1/0.28 = 3.5714.

But maybe I should compute it more accurately. Let me see: 0.96^2 = 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784.

The square root of 0.0784: as I thought, 0.28 exactly, because 0.28 * 0.28 = 0.0784.

So gamma is exactly 1/0.28 = 25/7 ≈ 3.57142857.

So gamma is exactly 25/7.

Hmm, okay. Now, the energy is gamma times m c squared. So I need to find the rest mass energy of the Li-6 nucleus.

Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. So the mass is approximately the sum of the masses of these particles. But wait, I think it's more accurate to use the atomic mass of the nucleus, considering binding energy. Or perhaps, for the purpose of this problem, we can approximate the mass using the sum of protons and neutrons' masses.

Wait, but the mass of a nucleus is slightly less than the sum of the individual protons and neutrons due to binding energy, but for the purpose of finding the rest mass energy, perhaps we can use the atomic mass. Let me think.

The standard approach is to use the mass of the nucleus, which can be found from the periodic table. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the mass of a proton and neutron.

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects me to use the mass number A as an approximation for the mass in units of u (atomic mass units). So the mass m is approximately A u, where A is the mass number.

Wait, but in any case, for the problem, perhaps I can proceed by assuming that the mass is approximately (3 protons + 3 neutrons) * their masses.

Wait, the mass of a proton is about 938 MeV/c². Similarly, a neutron is about 939.565 MeV/c². So let me get exact numbers.

Proton mass: m_p = 938.272 MeV/c² (from memory, but I might be a bit off, but perhaps I can look it up). Alternatively, perhaps using exact values: the proton mass is approximately 938.272 MeV/c², and neutron is 939.565 MeV/c².

Alternatively, perhaps the mass of Li-6 is about 6 * (average of proton and neutron), but maybe it's better to use the exact value from the periodic table.

Wait, the atomic mass of Li-6 is about 6.015116 atomic mass units (u). Because I remember that for example, Carbon-12 is 12 u exactly, and Li-6 is a bit less than 6 u. So looking up, I think the exact mass of Li-6 is approximately 6.015116 u.

Wait, but I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute it as the sum of protons and neutrons.

Each proton is about 1.007276 u, and each neutron is about 1.008665 u.

So Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons.

So the mass would be 3*(1.007276) + 3*(1.008665) = ?

3*(1.007276) = 3.021828 u.

3*(1.008665) = 3.025995 u.

Total = 3.021828 + 3.025995 = 6.047823 u.

Wait, but that's without considering the binding energy. The actual mass of Li-6 is less than 6 u because of the mass defect from binding energy. Wait, but that's not possible because the sum of the parts would be higher than the nucleus. Wait, no: the binding energy comes from the conversion of mass into energy, so the actual nucleus has a mass lower than the sum of the individual nucleons.

Wait, but earlier calculation gives me 3 protons and 3 neutrons summing up to 6.047823 u. But Li-6's actual mass is about 6.015116 u. So the binding energy would be the difference: 6.047823 - 6.015116 ≈ 0.032707 u. Which is about 29.8 MeV (since 1 u ≈ 931.5 MeV/c²).

But perhaps for the purpose of this problem, I can use the exact mass given, 6.015116 u, because the question probably expects that.

So m = 6.015116 u.

Now, I need to convert the mass into energy units (GeV). Since 1 u is approximately 931.5 MeV, which is 0.9315 GeV.

So m = 6.015116 u * 0.9315 GeV/u ≈ ?

Let me compute that: 6 * 0.9315 is 5.589 GeV. 0.015116 * 0.9315 ≈ approximately 0.01408 GeV. So total is approximately 5.589 + 0.01408 ≈ 5.60308 GeV.

Wait, let me compute it more precisely:

6 * 0.9315 = 5.589 GeV.

0.015116 * 0.9315 = ?

Let me compute 0.015116 * 0.9315.

0.01 * 0.9315 = 0.009315.

0.005116 * 0.9315 = let's compute 0.005 * 0.9315 = 0.0046575. Then 0.000116 * 0.9315 = approximately 0.0001082. So 0.0046575 + 0.0001082 = ~0.0047657. So total for 0.015116 is 0.009315 + 0.0047657 = 0.0140807 GeV.

So m c² is 5.589 + 0.0140807 ≈ 5.60308 GeV. So m c² ≈ 5.6031 GeV.

Wait, but wait, another approach: 6.015116 u * 931.5 MeV/u = ?

6.015116 * 931.5 = ?

Well, 6 * 931.5 = 5589 MeV = 5.589 GeV.

0.015116 * 931.5 ≈ let's compute 0.01 * 931.5 = 9.315 MeV, and 0.005116 * 931.5 ≈ approximately 4.765 MeV. So total is 9.315 + 4.765 ≈ 14.08 MeV, which is 0.01408 GeV. So total m c² is 5.589 + 0.01408 = 5.60308 GeV. So about 5.6031 GeV.

So m c² = 5.6031 GeV.

Now, the total energy E = gamma * m c².

gamma is 25/7 ≈ 3.57142857.

So E = 3.57142857 * 5.6031 GeV.

Let me compute that.

3 * 5.6031 = 16.8093.

0.57142857 * 5.6031 ≈ ?

Let me compute 0.5 * 5.6031 = 2.80155.

0.07142857 * 5.6031 ≈ approximately 0.4017.

So 2.80155 + 0.4017 ≈ 3.20325.

So E ≈ 16.8093 + 3.20325 = 20.01255 GeV.

Wait, but that's a rough calculation. Let me compute it more accurately.

Alternatively, 25/7 is approximately 3.57142857.

3.57142857 * 5.6031 = ?

Let me compute it step by step.

5.6031 * 3 = 16.8093.

5.6031 * 0.5 = 2.80155.

5.6031 * 0.07 = 0.392217.

5.6031 * 0.00142857 ≈ approximately 0.008 (since 5.6031 * 0.001 is ≈0.0056031, and 0.00042857 is about 0.002395, so sum is about 0.008).

So adding all together: 3.57142857 = 3 + 0.5 + 0.07 + 0.00142857.

So,

3 * 5.6031 = 16.8093.

0.5 *5.6031=2.80155 → 2.80155.

0.07 *5.6031=0.392217.

0.00142857 *5.6031 ≈ 0.007998.

Adding these: 16.8093 + 2.80155 = 19.61085. Then +0.392217 → 19.61085 + 0.392217 = 20.003067. Then +0.007998 → 20.011065 GeV.

So E ≈ 20.011 GeV.

But I think I should compute it more accurately with exact multiplication.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute 25/7 * 5.6031.

25 * 5.6031 = 140.0775.

Divide by 7: 140.0775 /7 = ?

140 /7 =20. 0.0775 /7 ≈0.011071.

So 20 + 0.011071 ≈20.011071 GeV.

So E ≈20.011 GeV.

Wait, but the question is the energy of the RHIC. Do they mean kinetic energy? Because sometimes, in particle physics, the energy given is the kinetic energy, not the total. If so, then I should compute K = (gamma -1) m c².

So, gamma is 25/7 ≈3.5714. So gamma -1 = 2.5714.

So K = 2.5714 *5.6031 GeV.

Compute that: 2 *5.6031=11.2062.

0.5714 *5.6031 ≈ ?

0.5 *5.6031=2.80155.

0.0714 *5.6031≈0.4015.

So total is 2.80155 + 0.4015≈3.20305.

So K=11.2062 +3.20305=14.40925 GeV.

Wait, but that's about 14.4 GeV. But looking at the options, the choices are around 18, 20, 21, 23 GeV.

Hmm, that's a problem. Because if I compute the total energy E as approximately 20 GeV, then that's one of the options.

Wait, let's look at the options again.

Options:
A) 18.475 GeV
B) 23.069 GeV
C) 20.132 GeV
D) 21.419 GeV

So my calculation for E (total energy) is approximately 20.011 GeV. The closest option is C) 20.132 GeV.

But perhaps my approximation for the mass is a bit off. Let me check.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the mass of Li-6 more accurately.

The exact mass of the Li-6 nucleus is 6.015116 u.

So m c² =6.015116 u * 931.5 MeV/u = ?

Compute 6 *931.5 =5589 MeV.

0.015116 *931.5 = let's compute that.

0.01 *931.5 =9.315 MeV.

0.005116 *931.5 = let's compute step by step.

0.005 *931.5 =4.6575 MeV.

0.000116 *931.5 = approximately 0.1082 MeV.

So total 4.6575 + 0.1082 =4.7657.

So 9.315 +4.7657 =14.0807 MeV.

So total m c² is 5589 +14.0807 =5603.0807 MeV =5.60308 GeV.

So m c² is 5.60308 GeV.

So E = gamma * m c² = (25/7) *5.60308 ≈ ?

Compute 25/7 =3.57142857.

3.57142857 *5.60308.

Let me compute that precisely.

5.60308 *3 =16.80924.

5.60308 *0.57142857.

Let me compute 5.60308 *0.5=2.80154.

5.60308 *0.07142857.

Compute 5.60308 *0.07 =0.3922156.

5.60308 *0.00142857≈0.008 (exact: 5.60308 *0.00142857 ≈ 0.008).

So 0.3922156 +0.008=0.3992156.

So 2.80154 +0.3992156=3.2007556.

So total E=16.80924 +3.2007556=20.01 GeV.

But wait, perhaps I should compute it with more precision.

Alternatively, 25/7 is 3.57142857.

3.57142857 *5.60308.

Let me calculate 3.57142857 *5.60308.

First, 3 *5.60308 =16.80924.

0.57142857 *5.60308.

Compute 0.5 *5.60308 =2.80154.

0.07142857 *5.60308.

Compute 0.07 *5.60308=0.3922156.

0.00142857 *5.60308 ≈ 0.008.

So 0.3922156 +0.008=0.3992156.

Adding to 2.80154 gives 3.2007556.

So 16.80924 + 3.2007556=20.01 GeV.

So E≈20.01 GeV.

But the options have option C as 20.132 GeV, which is a bit higher. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of m c².

Wait, the mass of Li-6 is 6.015116 u.

So m c² =6.015116 *931.5 MeV.

Compute 6.015116 *931.5.

Let me compute 6 *931.5=5589.

0.015116 *931.5.

Compute 0.01 *931.5=9.315.

0.005116 *931.5.

Compute 0.005*931.5=4.6575.

0.000116*931.5=0.1081.

So 4.6575 +0.1081=4.7656.

So total is 9.315 +4.7656=14.0806.

So 5589 +14.0806=5603.0806 MeV =5.60308 GeV. So that's correct.

Hmm, so perhaps the calculation is correct and the option is 20.132 GeV, but my result is 20.01 GeV. That's a discrepancy.

Wait, perhaps I should be more precise in the calculation of gamma.

Gamma is 25/7 =3.5714285714.

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma more accurately.

Wait, no, gamma is exactly 25/7 because when beta is 0.96, beta squared is 0.9216, so 1 - beta squared is 0.0784, whose square root is 0.28, so gamma is 1/0.28= 25/7 exactly.

So E = (25/7) *5.60308 GeV.

Wait, perhaps I can compute it differently.

5.60308 *25 =140.077 GeV.

Then divided by 7: 140.077 /7=20.011 GeV.

Hmm, but the option is 20.132.

Wait, could there be a mistake in the mass of the nucleus? Let me double-check.

Alternative approach: perhaps the mass is taken as the sum of the individual nucleon masses, not the actual mass.

Wait, the sum of 3 protons and 3 neutrons: each proton is about 938.272 MeV/c², each neutron is about 939.565 MeV/c².

So 3*(938.272) +3*(939.565) = ?

3*938.272 = 2814.816 MeV.

3*939.565=2818.695 MeV.

Total =2814.816 +2818.695=5633.511 MeV =5.633511 GeV.

So using this mass, the rest energy would be 5.633511 GeV.

Then E = gamma * m c² = (25/7) *5.633511.

25/7 is approximately 3.57142857.

3.57142857 *5.633511.

Let me calculate that.

3*5.633511=16.900533.

0.57142857 *5.633511.

Compute 0.5*5.633511=2.8167555.

0.07142857 *5.633511.

0.07 *5.633511=0.39434577.

0.00142857 *5.633511≈0.008.

So approximately 0.39434577 +0.008=0.40234577.

So 2.8167555 +0.40234577=3.21910127.

Adding to 16.900533 gives 16.900533 +3.21910127=20.119634 GeV.

Approximately 20.1196 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is very close.

So perhaps the problem expects the mass to be taken as the sum of individual nucleon masses, which gives a rest mass energy of ~5.6335 GeV, leading to E=20.1196 GeV, which is close to option C, 20.132 GeV.

But why would the problem use that approximation instead of the actual mass? Because perhaps the actual mass is not commonly known, and the problem expects you to use the sum of proton and neutron masses. Alternatively, perhaps the isotopic mass is considered as the sum.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the mass number (A=6) in atomic mass units and multiplied by c². So, 6 u *931.5 MeV/u =5589 MeV=5.589 GeV. Then E=gamma*mc²=3.5714 *5.589=?

3.5714 *5.589.

3 *5.589=16.767.

0.5714 *5.589 ≈3.199.

So total E=19.966 GeV, which is close to 20 GeV, but option C is 20.132 GeV.

Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing. Maybe I should re-express the problem in terms of exact formulas.

The formula is E = gamma * m c².

Gamma is 25/7.

m is the mass of the Li-6 nucleus, which is 6.015116 u.

So m c² =6.015116 u *931.5 MeV/u =6.015116 *931.5 MeV.

Let me compute that exactly:

6.015116 *931.5 =?

Compute 6 *931.5 =5589.

0.015116 *931.5 = let's compute 0.015 *931.5=13.9725 and 0.000116 *931.5=0.1081.

So 13.9725 +0.1081=14.0806.

Total mc²=5589 +14.0806=5603.0806 MeV=5.6030806 GeV.

So E= (25/7) *5.6030806 GeV.

(25/7)=3.57142857.

3.57142857 *5.6030806 = ?

Let me compute more accurately.

5.6030806 *3 =16.8092418.

5.6030806 *0.57142857 = ?

Compute 5.6030806 *0.5 =2.8015403.

5.6030806 *0.07142857 = ?

0.07 *5.6030806 =0.392215642.

0.00142857 *5.6030806 ≈0.008000000 (approximate).

So 0.392215642 +0.008=0.400215642.

So 2.8015403 +0.400215642=3.201755942.

Adding to 16.8092418 gives 16.8092418 +3.201755942=20.01099774 GeV.

So approximately 20.011 GeV.

But the option is C)20.132 GeV, which is 0.121 GeV higher. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of gamma. Let me re-calculate gamma.

v =0.96c.

beta=v/c=0.96.

beta squared is 0.9216.

1 - beta squared is 0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784)=0.28.

Gamma=1/0.28=3.57142857.

So gamma is correct.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is considering only the kinetic energy, but that brings us back to K = (gamma-1) m c².

Wait, if I compute K = (gamma-1) m c².

gamma-1=2.57142857.

So K=2.57142857 *5.6030806 GeV.

2.57142857 *5.6030806.

Compute 2 *5.6030806=11.2061612.

0.57142857 *5.6030806.

0.5 *5.6030806=2.8015403.

0.07142857 *5.6030806=0.4002156.

So 2.8015403 +0.4002156=3.2017559.

So K=11.2061612 +3.2017559=14.4079171 GeV.

Which is about 14.408 GeV. But that's not any of the options. So perhaps the problem is about the total energy, not the kinetic.

Wait, but the options are higher than 20 GeV.

Hmm.

Another thought: perhaps the problem is considering the nucleus as a collection of nucleons, and hence using the more precise mass.

Wait, let me recalculate m c² with more precise values.

Proton mass: m_p =938.272 MeV/c².

Neutron mass: m_n=939.565 MeV/c².

So for Li-6, 3 protons and 3 neutrons.

Total m =3*(938.272 +939.565) =3*(1877.837) =5633.511 MeV=5.633511 GeV.

So E=gamma * m c²= (25/7) *5.633511 GeV.

25/7=3.57142857.

So 3.57142857 *5.633511.

Compute 3 *5.633511=16.900533.

0.57142857 *5.633511.

0.5 *5.633511=2.8167555.

0.07142857 *5.633511=0.40234577.

So 2.8167555 +0.40234577=3.21910127.

So E=16.900533 +3.21910127=20.119634 GeV.

Which is approximately 20.1196 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV. That's very close.

Hmm, so maybe the correct answer is option C.

But why the discrepancy between using the actual mass and the sum of individual nucleon masses?

Because the actual mass of Li-6 is 6.015116 u, which is 5.60308 GeV, leading to E=20.011 GeV.

But when using the sum of protons and neutrons (5.6335 GeV), E is about 20.1196 GeV, which is close to option C.

So perhaps the problem expects the sum of individual nucleon masses, which gives E=20.1196 GeV, which is approximately 20.12 GeV.

Looking at option C: 20.132 GeV, which is very close.

So perhaps that's the intended approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects using the molar mass in some way, but I think I've covered the possibilities.

So the conclusion is that the correct option is C)20.132 GeV.

To determine the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) when the speed of the Li-6 nucleus is 0.96c, we calculate the total energy using the relativistic energy formula:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2
\]

### Step 1: Calculate the Lorentz factor (\(\gamma\))
The speed of the nucleus is \(v = 0.96c\). The Lorentz factor is given by:

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}
\]

Substituting \(v = 0.96c\):

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.96)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.9216}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.0784}} = \frac{1}{0.28} = 3.5714
\]

Thus, \(\gamma = 3.5714\).

### Step 2: Determine the rest energy (\(m c^2\))
The mass of the Li-6 nucleus is given as \(6.015116 \, \text{u}\), where \(1 \, \text{u} = 931.5 \, \text{MeV}/c^2\). Converting to GeV:

\[
m c^2 = 6.015116 \, \text{u} \times 931.5 \, \text{MeV/u} = 5603.0806 \, \text{MeV} = 5.60308 \, \text{GeV}
\]

---

### Step 3: Calculate the total energy (\(E\))
Using the formula \(E = \gamma m c^2\):

\[
E = 3.5714 \times 5.60308 \, \text{GeV}
\]

Breaking this into parts:

\[
3.5714 \times 5.60308 = 3 \times 5.60308 + 0.5714 \times 5.60308
\]

\[
3 \times 5.60308 = 16.80924, \quad 0.5714 \times 5.60308 = 3.200756
\]

\[
E = 16.80924 + 3.200756 = 20.01 \, \text{GeV}
\]

---

### Step 4: Refine the calculation using the sum of nucleon masses
The problem may instead use the sum of the masses of 3 protons and 3 neutrons. The proton mass is \(938.272 \, \text{MeV}/c^2\), and the neutron mass is \(939.565 \, \text{MeV}/c^2\). The total rest energy is:

\[
m c^2 = 3 \times (938.272 + 939.565) = 3 \times 1877.837 = 5633.511 \, \text{MeV} = 5.633511 \, \text{GeV}
\]

Now, calculate \(E\):

\[
E = 3.5714 \times 5.633511
\]

Breaking this into parts:

\[
3.5714 \times 5.633511 = 3 \times 5.633511 + 0.5714 \times 5.633511
\]

\[
3 \times 5.633511 = 16.900533, \quad 0.5714 \times 5.633511 = 3.219101
\]

\[
E = 16.900533 + 3.219101 = 20.119634 \, \text{GeV}
\]

---

### Step 5: Match with the options
The closest option to the calculated value of \(20.1196 \, \text{GeV}\) is **C) 20.132 GeV**. This suggests the problem expects the sum of nucleon masses to be used for \(m c^2\).
