Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about synthesizing a specific compound starting from benzene, and I need to choose the correct sequence of reactions from the given options. Let me break it down.

The target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Hmm, let me draw that structure in my mind. Benzene ring with substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3. Position 1 has an ethoxy group (OCH2CH3), position 2 has a tert-butyl group (C(CH3)3), and position 3 has a nitro group (NO2). So the substituents are at the 1, 2, and 3 positions of the benzene ring.

Wait, benzene is a six-membered ring. So numbering the positions would have the substituents on adjacent carbons. Let me think: the ethoxy is at position 1, tert-butyl at 2, and nitro at 3. So they are all adjacent to each other? Or is that possible? Wait, no, benzene is a ring, so substituents can be adjacent or meta, etc., but in this case, they are at positions 1, 2, and 3. So each substituent is adjacent to the others. That's a trisubstituted benzene with substituents at 1, 2, 3.

Wait, but in aromatic substitution, the order in which you add substituents affects the regiochemistry because each substituent directs the incoming group to a certain position. So the synthesis order is crucial here.

So starting with benzene, I need to add three substituents: ethoxy, tert-butyl, and nitro groups. Let me think about the directing effects of each group.

Nitro groups are meta directors. Ethoxy groups (OCH2CH3) are ortho/para directors because they are activating through resonance, but wait, no, wait. Wait, ethoxy is an electron-donating group because of the lone pairs on oxygen. So, it is an activating group and directs incoming electrophiles to ortho and para positions.

The tert-butyl group is a strong activating group because it's an alkyl group (electron-donating via induction). So it's an activating, ortho/para-directing substituent.

Wait, no! Wait, alkyl groups are activating (since they donate electrons via sigma bonds), so they are ortho/para directors. But nitro groups are deactivating (they withdraw electrons via resonance) and meta directors.

But in this target molecule, the substituents are at 1, 2, 3. So let me think about how to add them.

The problem is that each substitution affects where the next substituent goes. So I need to plan the order of substitution to get the correct positions.

So, perhaps the first group added will determine the positions of the others. Let's think about the possible order of adding the substituents.

Let me consider the possible orders. Option 1: Add tert-butyl first, then ethoxy, then nitro. Or option 2: Add nitro first, then tert-butyl, then ethoxy. Or another order.

Wait, but nitro groups are meta directors, so adding it first might complicate the positions of the others because it directs incoming groups to meta positions relative to itself.

Alternatively, adding the ethoxy group first, which is ortho/para, could allow the next substituent to be added in a specific position.

Wait, but I think the order of substitution matters a lot because each group affects where the next group will go. Let me think about each substituent and how they influence the ring.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Adding tert-butyl group: Since it's a strong activating group, it will be added via Friedel-Crafts alkylation. But wait, Friedel-Crafts requires a Lewis acid catalyst like AlCl3, and the alkyl chloride as the electrophile. So the first step would be to introduce the tert-butyl group using AlCl3 and tert-butyl chloride.

Wait, but if the first substituent is tert-butyl, then the benzene ring now has a tert-butyl group. The next group, say nitro, would be directed to the meta position relative to tert-butyl. But wait, how?

Alternatively, perhaps adding ethoxy first. But wait, ethoxy is an activating group, so if I add ethoxy first, then the next group would go ortho or para to it. Hmm.

Wait, but the target molecule has the ethoxy at position 1, tert-butyl at 2, and nitro at 3. So, positions 1, 2, and 3 are adjacent. Let me imagine the benzene ring with substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3. So each substituent is adjacent to the other.

Wait, that's a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene. So, in that arrangement, substituents are next to each other.

But the challenge is that when you add substituents, each new group is influenced by the existing substituents.

So perhaps I should think about which substituents can be introduced first without conflicting the positions of the others.

Alternatively, maybe the nitro group is introduced last because it's a strong deactivating group. If I introduce nitro last, the ring would be more activated earlier, making the other substitutions easier.

Wait, but let's think about the substituent's directing effects. Let me outline the substituents and their effects:

- tert-butyl: activating, ortho/para director.
- ethoxy: activating, ortho/para (but wait, wait, wait. Wait, no. Wait, I think I got that wrong. Wait, oxygen-containing groups: for example, methoxy is activating and ortho/para directing. But wait, ethoxy is similar, so yes, activating, ortho/para.

Wait, but wait, in benzene rings, the substituents can either be activating or deactivating. Activating groups (like -OCH3, -NH2, -CH3) make the ring more reactive towards electrophilic substitution, whereas deactivating groups (like -NO2, -COOH) make it less reactive.

So, in this case, the substituents are:

- tert-butyl: activating, ortho/para.
- ethoxy: activating, ortho/para.
- nitro: deactivating, meta.

Hmm. So the first substituent added would determine where the next group goes. Let me think about how to get the substituents in the correct positions.

Wait, the target is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So, numbering the benzene ring, substituents are at position 1 (ethoxy), 2 (tert-butyl), and 3 (nitro). So each is adjacent to the next. So in a ring, positions 1, 2, and 3 are adjacent, forming a meta arrangement relative to each other.

Wait, no, in benzene, each position is adjacent. So 1, 2, and 3 would be adjacent in a row. So the substituents are all next to each other.

Hmm, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the order of adding substituents.

Suppose I add the tert-butyl group first. Then, the ethoxy group would be added in an ortho or para position relative to the tert-butyl. Let's say I add ethoxy in the para position of tert-butyl. Then, when adding nitro, it would go meta to the ethoxy, which would be in the same ring position as the tert-butyl, but perhaps that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this more systematically.

Let me try to outline the possible steps:

The target molecule has:

- Position 1: ethoxy
- Position 2: tert-butyl
- Position 3: nitro

So substituents are in a 1,2,3 arrangement, meaning each is next to the others. So, for example, ethoxy is at position 1, tert-butyl at position 2, nitro at position 3.

Now, let's think about adding substituents in the correct order.

Option 1: Add tert-butyl first.

1. Benzene + AlCl3, tert-butyl chloride → tert-butylbenzene.

Now, the ring has a tert-butyl group at position 1 (arbitrary numbering for the first substitution). Now, adding the next substituent: where will it go?

The tert-butyl group is an activating, ortho/para director. So the next substituent will enter ortho or para to the tert-butyl.

So, if I add ethoxy next, it can enter ortho (position 2) or para (position 4). Wait, but our target has ethoxy at position 1, which is the same as tert-butyl's position. That can't be, since each substituent is in a distinct position.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the numbering. Let me think again. When adding substituents, the first substituent's position determines the positions of the others based on their directing effects.

Wait, perhaps the first substituent added is the ethoxy group, then the tert-butyl, then the nitro.

So:

1. Benzene → add ethoxy first.

How? Using an electrophilic substitution. To add an ethoxy group (OCH2CH3), we can perform an etherification reaction. One common way is to use a nucleophilic substitution, but wait, benzene is not nucleophilic. Alternatively, perhaps using a Friedel-Crafts acylation followed by reduction, but that seems complicated.

Wait, wait, no. To introduce an ethoxy group via electrophilic substitution, perhaps using an alkoxide? Or perhaps using a diazonium salt? Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, another approach: the ethoxy group can be introduced via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution if the ring is activated. But usually, that's tricky. Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group can be introduced via a substitution reaction using an electrophile generated from ethyl bromide, but that's not straightforward. Alternatively, perhaps using a sulfonation followed by displacement, but that's more advanced.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Wait, the ethoxy group can be introduced via an SN2 reaction if we have a good leaving group. But benzene doesn't have a good leaving group. Alternatively, perhaps using an electrophilic substitution where the ethoxide acts as a nucleophile.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group can be introduced via the use of ethyl chloride in the presence of a strong base, like KOH, but that's more for elimination. Alternatively, perhaps using a phase transfer catalyst, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I'm approaching this the wrong way. Let's think about the steps in the options given. The options list a series of reactions, including things like AlCl3 for Friedel-Crafts, HNO3/H2SO4 for nitration, SO3/H2SO4 for sulfonation, NaNO2/HCl for diazotization, Fe/HCl (maybe for reduction?), etc.

Looking at option D:

Option D's steps are:

i) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate benzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → perhaps reduce the nitro group? Wait, Fe/HCl is a catalyst for some reactions. Wait, maybe it's for a coupling reaction or for the Clemmensen reduction? Clemmensen uses Zn(Hg)/HCl and HCl with heat to reduce ketones to alkanes. Wait, but that's for carbonyl groups. Alternatively, maybe Fe/HCl is used in another context.

Wait, perhaps I should think about each option's steps.

Option D: starts with nitration, then Fe/HCl, then Friedel-Crafts with tert-butyl chloride, then nitration again, etc. Hmm.

Wait, but nitration of benzene would give nitrobenzene. Then Fe/HCl—maybe this is a step to reduce the nitro group? Because Fe and HCl are sometimes used in nitro reductions. For example, nitrobenzene can be reduced to benzene using Fe and HCl. But that would remove the nitro group, which may not be helpful.

Alternatively, maybe the Fe is for a different reaction, like the Birch reduction. But Birch reduction uses Fe and NH3, I think, and is for removing aromatic rings.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the steps each option suggests.

Option A:

i) t-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts alkylation.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration.

iii) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonation.

iv) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

v) dilute H2SO4 → maybe hydrolysis?

vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat → possibly hydrolysis or something else.

vii) NaOH/EtBr → perhaps an SN2 substitution? Because NaOH and EtBr would provide ethoxide ions as nucleophiles.

viii) Fe/HCl → maybe reduction.

ix) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration again.

Hmm, that's a lot of steps. So after adding t-butyl, then nitrate, sulfonate, etc.

But in the target molecule, we have nitro, ethoxy, and t-butyl groups. So perhaps the steps involve adding these groups in a certain order.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct order is to first add the ethoxy group, then the tert-butyl, then the nitro. Or maybe nitro first.

Wait, but considering that the nitro group is a meta director, if I add it first, then the other groups would have to go meta to it, which might not align with the target structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is added last, so that the other substituents are already in place to direct it correctly.

Wait, perhaps the sequence goes: first add tert-butyl, then add ethoxy, and then nitro. But how would that work?

Wait, adding tert-butyl first:

Benzene → Friedel-Crafts alkylation → tert-butylbenzene.

Now, the ring has a tert-butyl group. Next, adding ethoxy. Where would the ethoxy go? Since tert-butyl is an ortho/para director, the ethoxy can go into ortho or para positions relative to the tert-butyl.

If I add ethoxy in the para position, then the next substituent (nitro) would be directed to the meta position relative to the ethoxy, which is adjacent to the tert-butyl.

Alternatively, maybe adding ethoxy in the ortho position, but that may lead to steric issues.

Wait, but in the target molecule, the ethoxy is at position 1, tert-butyl at position 2, and nitro at position 3. So, positions 1,2,3 are adjacent. So, if I have the tert-butyl at position 1, adding ethoxy at position 2 (ortho) would be possible. Then, when adding nitro, how would that go?

But tert-butyl is an ortho/para director, so if I add ethoxy to the ortho position of tert-butyl, then the next substituent would be directed based on the ethoxy group.

Wait, but ethoxy is an activating, ortho/para director. So, if I have tert-butyl and ethoxy on adjacent positions, the next substituent (nitro) would be directed by the ethoxy group.

Wait, but nitro is a deactivating, meta director. So, if I have ethoxy at position 1, and tert-butyl at position 2, then adding nitro would be influenced by both groups. But that's complicated because substituents' directing effects can compete.

Wait, perhaps the nitro group should be added before the ethoxy. Let me think.

Wait, let's try a different approach. Let's consider the options and see which one makes sense.

Looking at Option D:

i) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate benzene → nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → maybe reduce the nitro group to amine? Or perhaps it's for something else.

iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts alkylation.

iv) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate again.

v) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

vi) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonate.

vii) dilute H2SO4 → maybe hydrolysis.

viii) H3O+, H2O/Heat → acid workup.

ix) NaOH/EtBr → perhaps a substitution reaction.

Hmm, this seems complicated. Let's see:

1. Nitrate benzene → nitrobenzene.

2. Fe/HCl: Maybe reduce nitro to amine group. So nitrobenzene → aniline.

3. Friedel-Crafts alkylation with tert-butyl chloride → would need the ring to be activated. Aniline is strongly activating, so it would undergo Friedel-Crafts. So benzene with nitro and tert-butyl groups? Wait, but in this step, after reduction, we have aniline. Then adding a tert-butyl group via Friedel-Crafts would give tert-butyl aniline.

Wait, but Friedel-Crafts alkylation is typically used on activated rings, like those with -NH2 groups. So that's possible.

Then, after adding the tert-butyl, step iv is nitration again. So now, the ring has -NH2 and tert-butyl. But wait, the nitration step would be directed by the substituents.

Wait, but the target has a nitro group as well. So perhaps this is not the right path.

Alternatively, maybe the steps in option D are not leading to the desired product. Let me think.

Another option is option C:

i) t-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts → tert-butylbenzene.

ii) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonation. Wait, sulfonation adds a sulfonic acid group, which is a strong deactivating, meta-directing group.

iii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration. Now, the ring has t-butyl and SO3 groups.

Wait, but where would the nitro group go? The sulfonic acid group is meta-directing and deactivating, and the t-butyl is ortho/para and activating. So, the nitration would be directed by the more influential group. Since sulfonic acid is a strong deactivating group, the nitro group would likely go meta to the sulfonic acid. But that's complicating things, and the target doesn't have a sulfonic acid group.

Hmm, perhaps option C isn't correct.

Looking at option B:

i) t-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → t-butylbenzene.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate it. Now, the ring has t-butyl and nitro groups.

iii) Fe/HCl → perhaps reduce the nitro group to amine.

iv) HNO3/H2SO4 → re-nitrate?

v) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat → hydrolysis, maybe to form a phenol.

vii) NaOH/EtBr → SN2 substitution, perhaps introducing an ethoxy group.

viii) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonate.

ix) dilute H2SO4 → maybe hydrolysis again.

This sequence seems to involve several steps, including nitration, reduction, diazotization, etc. But I'm not sure how that leads to the target molecule.

Now, looking at option A:

i) t-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts → t-butylbenzene.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate → now, with t-butyl and nitro groups.

iii) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonate. Now, the ring has t-butyl, nitro, and sulfonic acid groups.

iv) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

v) dilute H2SO4 → perhaps hydrolysis.

vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat → maybe another hydrolysis or workup.

vii) NaOH/EtBr → substitution, introducing an ethoxy group.

viii) Fe/HCl → perhaps reduction.

ix) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate again.

This seems to have a lot of steps, but perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via substitution, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct order is to first introduce the nitro group, then the ethoxy, then the tert-butyl. Let me see.

Wait, but that would require the nitro group to be added first, which is a meta director. Then, when adding the ethoxy, it would go to the meta position relative to nitro. Then, adding the tert-butyl, which is an activating group, would be directed by the ethoxy group.

Hmm, perhaps.

Wait, let's think: starting with benzene.

1. Nitration → nitro group at position 1.

2. Then, ethoxy group added. Nitro is meta director, so ethoxy would go to position 3 (meta to nitro).

3. Then, tert-butyl group is added. The ethoxy is an activating, ortho/para director. So the tert-butyl would go ortho or para to ethoxy, which is at position 3.

So, if ethoxy is at 3, adding tert-butyl would go to position 2 or 4. But in the target molecule, tert-butyl is at position 2, adjacent to ethoxy (position 1?), no, wait, the target has ethoxy at position 1, tert-butyl at 2, nitro at 3.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused with the numbering. Let me consider the positions again.

If I have nitro at position 1, then ethoxy would be added at position 3 (meta), since nitro is a meta director.

Then, the tert-butyl would be added, directed by the ethoxy group at position 3. Since ethoxy is an ortho/para director, the tert-butyl would go to positions 2 or 4 relative to ethoxy.

Wait, so if ethoxy is at 3, then ortho positions would be 2 and 4. So the tert-butyl could go to position 2 or 4. But in the target, it's at position 2, and ethoxy is at position 1. Hmm, perhaps this approach isn't lining up.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct order is to introduce the ethoxy group first, then the tert-butyl, then the nitro.

So:

1. Benzene → add ethoxy group, perhaps via a substitution reaction. But how?

Wait, but earlier I thought that introducing ethoxy via Friedel-Crafts may not be straightforward because AlCl3 with ethyl chloride might not work as Friedel-Crafts is for acylations or alkylation with strong activating groups. Alternatively, perhaps using a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but that requires a strongly activated ring, like having a strong electron-withdrawing group already present.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the steps in the options again.

Looking at option D:

Step i) nitrate → nitro group added.

Step ii) Fe/HCl → maybe reduce nitro to amine.

Step iii) Friedel-Crafts alkylation with t-butyl chloride → add t-butyl group.

But after reducing nitro to amine, the ring is very activated, so Friedel-Crafts should work.

So:

1. Nitrobenzene → after Fe/HCl → aniline.

2. Aniline → Friedel-Crafts alkylation → tert-butylaniline.

Then step iv) nitrate again. Nitration of aniline would be difficult because aniline is highly activating, but the nitration would occur. Where would the nitro group go? Aniline has the amino group, which is a strong activating, ortho/para director. So when nitrating aniline, the nitro group would go para to the amino group.

Wait, but we already have a nitro group from the first step. Unless step iv is adding another nitro group, but the target has only one nitro group.

Hmm, perhaps this isn't the right path.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to first add the ethoxy group, then the tert-butyl, then the nitro.

But how to add ethoxy. Wait, perhaps via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but that's challenging. Alternatively, perhaps using a different approach, like the hydroxy group being present first.

Wait, maybe the correct order is to add the tert-butyl first, then the nitro, then the ethoxy.

Wait, no, because nitro is a deactivating group, which would make the ring less reactive for subsequent substitutions.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is to first add the ethoxy group, then the tert-butyl, and then the nitro.

But how to add ethoxy. Alternatively, perhaps it's added via a nucleophilic substitution after activating the ring.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about each option's steps and see which one logically leads to the target.

Option D: Steps are nitration, Fe/HCl, Friedel-Crafts, nitration, diazotization, sulfonation, dilute H2SO4, H3O+/H2O/Heat, NaOH/EtBr.

Wait, let's think step by step:

1. Benzene → nitrate → nitrobenzene.

2. Fe/HCl → reduce nitro group to amine → aniline.

3. Friedel-Crafts alkylation with t-butyl chloride → add t-butyl group to aniline. Since aniline is strongly activating, this would happen. The t-butyl group would be added in the most activated positions, which are ortho and para to the amino group.

Wait, but the amino group is in position 1, so adding t-butyl at position 2 or 4.

4. Nitrate again → add another nitro group. But the target only has one nitro group, so this may not fit.

Hmm, perhaps this isn't the right approach.

Looking back, perhaps the correct option is option D, but I'm not seeing it clearly yet.

Alternatively, maybe the correct sequence is:

1. Add ethoxy first.

But I don't see the steps for that in any of the options. Let me look again.

Option B:

i) t-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → t-butylbenzene.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate → nitro group added. Now, the substituents are t-butyl and nitro.

iii) Fe/HCl → perhaps reduce nitro to amine.

iv) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate again.

v) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

vi) H3O+/H2O/Heat → hydrolysis → maybe form a phenol.

vii) NaOH/EtBr → SN2 substitution, introducing ethoxy.

viii) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonate.

ix) dilute H2SO4 → hydrolysis.

Hmm, perhaps after several steps, an ethoxy group is introduced. But I'm not sure if this leads to the correct positions.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is D, which starts with nitration, then reduction, then Friedel-Crafts.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck trying to map each option's steps to the target molecule. Maybe I should think about the substituents' order.

The target has ethoxy, tert-butyl, and nitro groups. Let's say the correct order is tert-butyl first, then nitro, then ethoxy. But how?

Wait, if I add tert-butyl first, then nitro would go meta to it. But then adding ethoxy would be directed by the nitro group (since nitro is meta and deactivating). Hmm, that might not fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the order is nitro first, then ethoxy, then tert-butyl.

Wait, let's see:

1. Benzene → nitrate → nitro group at position 1.

2. Nitro is a meta director, so when adding ethoxy, it would go to position 3 (meta to nitro).

3. Now, the ring has nitro at 1 and ethoxy at 3. The ethoxy is activating and ortho/para, so adding the tert-butyl group would go to ortho or para to ethoxy.

Para to ethoxy (position 3) would be position 6, which is not adjacent to nitro. Ortho to ethoxy would be positions 2 and 4. Position 2 is adjacent to nitro (position 1), which is desired.

So:

1. Nitro at 1.

2. Ethoxy at 3 (meta to nitro).

3. Tert-butyl at 2 (ortho to ethoxy, adjacent to nitro).

That aligns with the target molecule.

So the order would be nitrate first, then ethoxy, then tert-butyl.

Now, how would this be achieved in the options.

Looking at the options, the steps need to include nitration, then introducing ethoxy, then Friedel-Crafts for tert-butyl.

But looking at the options, I don't see any that have nitration first, then ethoxy, then alkylation.

Wait, let me check option D:

Option D steps:

i) HNO3 → nitrate.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduction → amine.

iii) Friedel-Crafts → add t-butyl.

iv) HNO3 → nitrate again.

Hmm, that doesn't fit, because it's adding nitro, then another nitro.

Option B:

i) t-butyl chloride.

ii) nitrate.

iii) Fe/HCl.

iv) nitrate again.

No, that's not right.

Option C:

i) t-butyl.

ii) SO3.

iii) nitrate.

Hmm, not as well.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence isn't present in the options, but I must choose the one that best fits.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct order is nitrate, then ethoxy via a different method, then t-butyl via Friedel-Crafts.

But looking at the options, none of them have a nitration step followed by ethoxy introduction.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me re-examine the options.

Option D:

i) HNO3 → nitrate.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine.

iii) Friedel-Crafts → add t-butyl.

iv) HNO3 → nitrate again.

v) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

vi) SO3 → sulfonate.

vii) dilute H2SO4.

viii) H3O+/H2O/Heat.

ix) NaOH/EtBr → substitution.

Wait, perhaps the steps are:

1. Benzene → nitrate → nitrobenzene.

2. Reduce nitro to amine → aniline.

3. Friedel-Crafts → add t-butyl → aniline with t-butyl.

4. Nitrate again → but where? The amino group is a strong activator, so nitro would go para to it.

5. Then, diazotization, followed by hydrolysis to form a phenol.

6. Sulfonate → add SO3.

7. Hydrolysis → remove SO3.

8. NaOH/EtBr → introduce ethoxy group via SN2.

Wait, but I'm not sure how this would result in the correct substituent positions.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is D, but I'm not seeing it clearly.

Wait, another approach: the target has 1-ethoxy, 2-t-Bu, 3-nitro.

So, the substituents are in a 1,2,3 arrangement.

Let me think about the order of addition. To get this arrangement, perhaps the substituents must be added in a way that each is adjacent.

Assuming that the ethoxy is introduced after the t-Bu, because the t-Bu is activating and can direct the ethoxy to the correct position.

Wait, let's outline the steps:

1. Benzene → add t-Bu via Friedel-Crafts → t-Bu benzene.

2. Nitrate this → nitro group is added meta to t-Bu. So, t-Bu is at position 1, nitro at position 3.

3. Now, add ethoxy group. The directing effects are from t-Bu and nitro. The t-Bu is activating (ortho/para), and nitro is deactivating (meta). So, the ethoxy would likely go para to the t-Bu (position 4) or ortho (position 2). But the target needs ethoxy at position 1, which is where the t-Bu is. That can't be.

Hmm, that doesn't fit.

Alternative approach: perhaps the nitro group is added last.

1. Benzene → add ethoxy via some method. But earlier steps don't show that.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the nitro group is introduced via a diazonium salt. Let me think.

Suppose I have benzene with ethoxy and t-Bu groups. Then, introducing nitro via diazonium salt would allow me to add it at a specific position.

Wait, for example:

1. Benzene → add ethoxy (how?), then add t-Bu, then introduce nitro via diazonium salt.

But I'm not sure how to add ethoxy first. Alternatively, maybe the correct steps involve adding t-Bu, then nitro, then ethoxy via substitution.

Wait, but substitution reactions usually require a good leaving group, which benzene doesn't have. So perhaps I'm stuck.

Given the time I'm taking, perhaps I should look for the option that correctly sequences the substituents in the order of nitro after t-Bu and ethoxy.

Wait, looking again at option D:

i) nitrate → nitro.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduce to amine.

iii) Friedel-Crafts → add t-Bu.

iv) nitrate again → add another nitro group? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps after adding t-Bu, the nitration would add nitro in a specific position.

Wait, but the target has only one nitro group. So this suggests that option D may not be the right one.

Looking back, perhaps the correct order is to first add t-Bu, then ethoxy, then nitro.

But how to add ethoxy after t-Bu. Since t-Bu is activating, perhaps after t-Bu is added, the ethoxy can be introduced via Friedel-Crafts. But Friedel-Crafts is for alkylations or acylations. Adding ethoxy would require introducing an oxygen-containing group, which is more like an ether.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution. For that, the ring must have a strong electron-withdrawing group, like a nitro group, to activate the ring towards nucleophilic substitution.

So, perhaps the steps are:

1. Add t-Bu.

2. Add nitro group → which directs the next group to meta.

3. Then, add ethoxy via nucleophilic substitution, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct order is:

1. Add nitro.

2. Add t-Bu.

3. Add ethoxy via a substitution.

But I'm not sure.

Given the time I've spent and the confusion, I think I'll have to make an educated guess based on the options.

The correct option must involve adding t-Bu via Friedel-Crafts, then adding nitro, then adding ethoxy.

Looking at option D:

After adding nitro and t-Bu, perhaps the ethoxy is added via a substitution step (like NaOH and EtBr), which would require a good leaving group. But without a leaving group, I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the sulfonic acid group is a leaving group.

Wait, in option D, after several steps, including sulfonation and then hydrolysis, perhaps the sulfonic acid group is converted into a leaving group.

Wait, let's think:

If I have a sulfonic acid group (-SO3H), under certain conditions, it can be converted into a good leaving group. For example, in the presence of a strong base, it could become -SO3- which is a better leaving group.

So, steps in option D:

After adding t-Bu and nitro groups, perhaps a sulfonate group is added, then hydrolyzed to a phenol, which could then undergo an SN2 substitution with EtBr in basic conditions to introduce the ethoxy group.

But I'm not exactly sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is introduced via a substitution using a good leaving group.

In any case, after considering all the options, I think the correct sequence is option D, which starts with nitration, then reduction, then Friedel-Crafts, etc., leading to the desired substitution pattern.

To synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene, the sequence of reactions must carefully consider the directing effects of substituents and the regiochemistry of each step. The target molecule has substituents at positions 1 (ethoxy), 2 (tert-butyl), and 3 (nitro), forming a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene. The order of substitution is critical because each substituent influences the position of subsequent groups.

### Key Analysis of the Options:

#### **Option A**:
1. **t-BuCl/AlCl₃**: Friedel-Crafts alkylation introduces the tert-butyl group.
2. **HNO₃/H₂SO₄**: Nitration adds a nitro group, which would be directed to the meta position relative to the tert-butyl group.
3. **SO₃/H₂SO₄**: Sulfonation introduces a sulfonic acid group, which is a strong deactivating, meta-directing group.
4. **NaNO₂/HCl**: Diazotization.
5. **dilute H₂SO₄**: Hydrolysis.
6. **H₃O⁺, H₂O/Heat**: Acid workup.
7. **NaOH/EtBr**: Substitution to introduce an ethoxy group.
8. **Fe/HCl**: Reduction.
9. **HNO₃/H₂SO₄**: Nitration again.

This sequence introduces multiple substituents, but the sulfonic acid group complicates the synthesis, and the target molecule does not include such a group. The steps do not align well with the desired substitution pattern.

#### **Option B**:
1. **t-BuCl/AlCl₃**: Friedel-Crafts alkylation introduces the tert-butyl group.
2. **HNO₃/H₂SO₄**: Nitration adds a nitro group.
3. **Fe/HCl**: Reduction of the nitro group to an amine.
4. **HNO₃/H₂SO₄**: Nitration again.
5. **NaNO₂/HCl**: Diazotization.
6. **H₃O⁺, H₂O/Heat**: Hydrolysis.
7. **NaOH/EtBr**: Substitution to introduce an ethoxy group.
8. **SO₃/H₂SO₄**: Sulfonation.
9. **dilute H₂SO₄**: Hydrolysis.

This sequence involves multiple nitrations and reductions, which may not lead to the desired product. The nitration steps could result in multiple nitro groups, and the sequence does not clearly align with the target substitution pattern.

#### **Option C**:
1. **t-BuCl/AlCl₃**: Friedel-Crafts alkylation introduces the tert-butyl group.
2. **SO₃/H₂SO₄**: Sulfonation introduces a sulfonic acid group.
3. **HNO₃/H₂SO₄**: Nitration adds a nitro group.
4. **Fe/HCl**: Reduction.
5. **NaNO₂/HCl**: Diazotization.
6. **HNO₃/H₂SO₄**: Nitration again.
7. **H₃O⁺, H₂O/Heat**: Hydrolysis.
8. **dilute H₂SO₄**: Hydrolysis.
9. **NaOH/EtBr**: Substitution to introduce an ethoxy group.

The introduction of a sulfonic acid group early in the sequence complicates the synthesis, and the target molecule does not include such a group. The steps do not clearly lead to the desired substitution pattern.

#### **Option D**:
1. **HNO₃/H₂SO₄**: Nitration adds a nitro group.
2. **Fe/HCl**: Reduction of the nitro group to an amine.
3. **t-BuCl/AlCl₃**: Friedel-Crafts alkylation introduces the tert-butyl group.
4. **HNO₃/H₂SO₄**: Nitration adds another nitro group.
5. **NaNO₂/HCl**: Diazotization.
6. **SO₃/H₂SO₄**: Sulfonation.
7. **dilute H₂SO₄**: Hydrolysis.
8. **H₃O⁺, H₂O/Heat**: Acid workup.
9. **NaOH/EtBr**: Substitution to introduce an ethoxy group.

This sequence involves multiple nitrations and reductions, which may not lead to the desired product. The nitration steps could result in multiple nitro groups, and the sequence does not clearly align with the target substitution pattern.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing all options, none of the sequences perfectly align with the desired substitution pattern for 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. However, based on the reasoning provided, **Option D** appears to be the most plausible choice, as it includes steps that could potentially lead to the target molecule, despite the complexity and potential for multiple substituents.
