Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question is about selecting the right reagents for two different reactions. The first reaction is between butan-2-one and NaCN with a reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction is between 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile and reagent B (which is H2O) to give 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. The options are A, B, C, D, each pairing reagents A and B with different possibilities.

Hmm, I need to figure out what reagents A and B are. Let me think about each reaction separately.

Starting with the first reaction: butan-2-one (which is (CH3)2CO) reacting with NaCN and reagent A to form 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, butan-2-one is a ketone. So, when a ketone reacts with NaCN, I remember that it's a nucleophilic addition. But wait, NaCN is a source of CN- ions. So, maybe it's a cyanide adding to the carbonyl group.

But wait, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let's write the structures. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. So when CN- adds, the mechanism would be: the carbonyl oxygen becomes an oxonium ion, then the CN- attacks. Then, the oxygen would have a negative charge, which would get protonated. But wait, in the product, it's a hydroxyl group. So maybe after the addition, we have a protonation or some workup.

Wait, but the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me draw that. The structure would be CH(CH3)2CN-OH? Wait, no. Wait, butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN, but the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me think: the nitrile group is at position 2, and the hydroxy is also at position 2, along with a methyl group.

Wait, more accurately, the structure would be (CH3)C(OH)CH2CN? No, wait. Wait, butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN, but butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. When you add CN- to the carbonyl, you get a cyanohydrin. So, the product is a cyanohydrin.

Wait, the cyanohydrin formation. So, in the first step, the ketone (butan-2-one) reacts with CN- (from NaCN) in a nucleophilic addition to form a cyanohydrin. The reaction typically requires an acid catalyst. So, reagent A is probably an acid, like H3O+.

Wait, wait. NaCN is a weak base, I think. So the reaction of ketone with CN- might require some acid to protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making it more electrophilic. So, adding H3O+ as a catalyst would make sense. So reagent A is H3O+.

Looking at the options, option A and B have A as H3O+. Options C and D have A as NaHSO3. Hmm, what's NaHSO3? It's sodium bisulfite, which is a source of HSO3^- ions, which are weaker acids than H3O+.

Wait, but the first reaction is a cyanohydrin formation, which I think uses an acid catalyst. So, for that, H3O+ (like H2SO4, HCl, etc.) would be used. So, reagent A is H3O+.

So which options have A as H3O+? Options A and B. So that narrows it down to A or B for the first part.

Now, the second reaction: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacts with reagent B (H2O) to give 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. So, the nitrile group (-CN) is being converted into a carboxylic acid (-COOH) group. 

How does a nitrile become a carboxylic acid? I remember that nitriles can be oxidized. The usual reagents for oxidizing nitriles to carboxylic acids are strong oxidizing agents under acidic conditions. For example, using KMnO4 under acidic conditions, or other strong oxidizing agents like K2Cr2O7 in H2SO4.

Wait, but the reagent B is H2O. Hmm, that's confusing. Alternatively, maybe it's an acid workup. Alternatively, perhaps the nitrile is first hydrolyzed to an amide, then further to a carboxylic acid. But the reaction conditions are important.

Wait, the reagent B is given as H2O, but perhaps it's part of a hydrolysis step. Wait, wait a moment. Let me think: the starting material is a nitrile with a hydroxyl group in the same carbon. So when you hydrolyze the nitrile, under certain conditions, you can get a carboxylic acid.

Wait, the conversion of nitrile to carboxylic acid typically involves strong acidic or basic conditions with heat. For example, in acidic conditions, using H2SO4 (concentrated) and heat, the nitrile is hydrolyzed to a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, under basic conditions, you might get a different product, like a carboxylate.

But in this question, B is the reagent. Since the product is a carboxylic acid, it's more likely that the hydrolysis is done under acidic conditions. So, reagent B would be something acidic, like HCl or H3O+.

Wait, looking back at the question, the reagent B is (H2O). So maybe the hydrolysis is being done in the presence of H2O and an acid. So, perhaps B is an acid, like HCl or H3O+.

Wait, the options for B are: in option A, B is HCl; option B, B is CH3COOH; option C, B is HCl; option D, B is CH3COOH.

Wait, but the reaction is 2-hydroxybutanenitrile turning into 2-hydroxybutanoic acid. So, the nitrile (-CN) becomes -COOH. So, the hydrolysis of nitrile to carboxylic acid requires a strong acid. So, HCl is a strong acid, acetic acid is a weak acid.

Which condition would favor the formation of the carboxylic acid? I think that using a strong acid, like HCl, would be more effective because it provides the necessary H+ ions for the hydrolysis steps.

Wait, but wait: the starting material already has a hydroxyl group (2-hydroxy). When the nitrile is hydrolyzed, the hydroxyl could influence the reaction. But perhaps the key is that the nitrile is in an acidic environment to hydrolyze to the acid.

So, reagent B would be an acid, either HCl (strong) or CH3COOH (weak). Which one is more appropriate for the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids?

In the standard procedure, nitriles are hydrolyzed in the presence of strong acid and heat. So, HCl would be a better choice as it's a stronger acid and would protonate the nitrile group, facilitating the hydrolysis.

So, for reaction 2, reagent B is HCl.

Now, looking at the options, which options have B as HCl? Option A and C. Earlier, in reaction 1, we determined that A must be H3O+ (so options A and B have A as H3O+). So, for option A, reagent B is HCl. That fits.

Wait, but let me think again. Is there any other possibility?

Alternatively, sometimes in the presence of H2O and a mild acid, nitriles can hydrolyze to amides or acids. But nitriles are generally hydrolyzed under acidic or basic conditions. For the formation of the carboxylic acid, acidic conditions (HCl) are more likely.

So, putting it together: for the first reaction, A is H3O+ (since it's the acid catalyst for the cyanohydrin formation), and for the second reaction, B is HCl.

Looking back at the options:

Option A: A = H3O+, B = HCl → this fits.

Option B: A = H3O+, B = CH3COOH → not, since B would be a weak acid, which may not be sufficient for the nitrile hydrolysis.

Option C: A= NaHSO3, B=HCl → A isn't H3O+, so probably not.

Option D: A= NaHSO3, B = CH3COOH → both reagents don't fit.

So the correct option is A.

The problem involves determining the suitable reagents for two reactions. 

### Reaction 1:
The first reaction involves the formation of a cyanohydrin from butan-2-one (a ketone) and NaCN. This reaction requires an acid catalyst to protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making it more electrophilic for the nucleophilic attack by CN⁻. Among the options, **H₃O⁺** (a strong acid) is the appropriate reagent for this purpose. Therefore, reagent **A** must be **H₃O⁺**.

### Reaction 2:
The second reaction involves the conversion of a nitrile group (-CN) into a carboxylic acid (-COOH) in the compound 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. The hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids typically requires strong acidic conditions. Among the options, **HCl** (a strong acid) is the most suitable reagent for this reaction. Therefore, reagent **B** must be **HCl**.

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A:** A = H₃O⁺, B = HCl → Both reagents are correct.
- **Option B:** A = H₃O⁺, B = CH₃COOH → While A is correct, B (CH₃COOH) is a weak acid and insufficient for the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids.
- **Option C:** A = NaHSO₃, B = HCl → A (NaHSO₃) is not suitable for the cyanohydrin formation.
- **Option D:** A = NaHSO₃, B = CH₃COOH → Neither reagent is suitable for the respective reactions.

### Conclusion:
The correct option is **A**, where A = H₃O⁺ and B = HCl.
