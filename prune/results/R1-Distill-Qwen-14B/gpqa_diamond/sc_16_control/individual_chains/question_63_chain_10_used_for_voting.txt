Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a diatomic molecule and the quantum rotation-vibration model. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to think through it.

The question is about a molecule made of elements X and Y. The given data are Mx=20 amu, My=2 amu, bond length R=2 angstroms, and angular frequency w=4e14 rad/s. The molecule is in its fundamental state, and we need to find the momentum of a photon that would cause it to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy.

Wait, the fundamental state in a rotation-vibration model... I think the fundamental state is the state of lowest energy, which is the first vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (maybe J=0, depending on the model). But I'm a bit confused. Oh wait, no, the fundamental state is the state with the least energy, so the lowest vibrational state, which is v=0, and the lowest rotational state, which is J=0. So when the molecule absorbs a photon, it moves to the next higher energy state. The next state would have the next higher energy, which could be a change in either vibration or rotation.

Wait, the problem says "the next state with the lowest possible energy." So maybe it's the next higher state, but it's the smallest possible energy increase. So perhaps the molecule could either increase its vibrational state or its rotational state. Which transition requires less energy?

The energy levels for vibration are quantized as E_v = (v + 1/2) h ν. And for rotation, E_J = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant. So the fundamental state is v=0, J=0. The next possible states are either v=1 or J=1. Which of these requires smaller energy?

The energy change for vibration from v=0 to v=1 is ΔE_v = (1 + 1/2 - (0+1/2)) h ν = h ν. For rotation, the change from J=0 to J=1 is ΔE_J = B [1*(1+1)] - B [0*(0+1)] = 2B.

So we need to compare h ν and 2B. Which is smaller?

Wait, let me compute both. Let's find B, the rotational constant. B is given by h/(8π² I c), where I is the moment of inertia. I = μ R², and μ is the reduced mass.

The reduced mass μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My). Mx is 20 amu, My is 2 amu.

So μ = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) = 40 / 22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.818 amu. Wait, but 1 amu is about 1.6605e-27 kg. So μ = 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg ≈ let me calculate that.

1.818 * 1.6605 ≈ 3.024, so 3.024e-27 kg. Hmm.

I = μ R². R is 2 angstroms. 1 angstrom is 1e-10 meters, so R = 2e-10 m. So R squared is (2e-10)^2 = 4e-20 m².

So I = μ R² = 3.024e-27 kg * 4e-20 m² = 1.2096e-46 kg m².

Then B = h/(8 π² I c). Wait, no, wait the rotational constant B is given by h/(8 π² I c) or something else? Wait, no, I think the rotational energy levels are E_J = B J (J+1), where B is h/(8 π² I). Alternatively, sometimes B is expressed as ħ²/(2I), but I might be mixing things up. Let me get this right.

The rotational energy levels are given by E_J = (ħ² J (J+1)) / (2 I), where ħ is the reduced Planck constant. Alternatively, sometimes it's written with B, the rotational constant, where E_J = B J (J+1), and B = ħ²/(2 I). So yes, B = ħ²/(2 I). Since ħ is h/(2 π), ħ² = h²/(4 π²). So B = (h²/(4 π²)) / (2 I) ) = h²/(8 π² I).

Ah, right. So B = h²/(8 π² I). Let me plug in the numbers.

h is Planck's constant, 6.626e-34 J s. So h squared is (6.626e-34)^2 ≈ 4.39e-67 J² s². I is about 1.2096e-46 kg m².

So B = (4.39e-67) / (8 π² * 1.2096e-46). Let's compute denominator first: 8 * π² ≈ 8 * 9.8696 ≈ 78.9568. So denominator is 78.9568 * 1.2096e-46 ≈ 78.9568 * 1.2096 ≈ 95.4; so denominator is 95.4e-46 = 9.54e-45.

So B ≈ 4.39e-67 / 9.54e-45 = approximately 4.39e-67 / 9.54e-45 = let's compute exponents: 1e-67 / 1e-45 = 1e-22. So 4.39 / 9.54 is about 0.4598. So B ≈ 0.4598e-22 J.

Wait, wait, let me double-check that:

Wait, 4.39e-67 / 9.54e-45 = (4.39 /9.54) * 1e-67+45 = 0.46 *1e-22 = 4.6e-23 J. Hmm, that seems more accurate.

Wait, 4.39e-67 / 9.54e-45 = (4.39 /9.54) * 1e-(67-45) ) → 4.39 /9.54 is approx 0.4598, and exponent is -22. So 0.4598e-22 = 4.598e-23 J.

So B is approximately 4.598e-23 J.

Now, the energy difference for a rotational transition from J=0 to J=1 is ΔE_rot = E_J=1 - E_J=0 = B*(1)(2) - 0 = 2B ≈ 2 * 4.598e-23 ≈ 9.196e-23 J.

The energy difference for a vibrational transition from v=0 to v=1 is ΔE_vibr = h ν, where ν is the frequency. Since w is given as 4e14 rad/s, the frequency ν is w/(2π). So ν = (4e14)/(2π) ≈ 4e14/(6.283) ≈ 6.366e13 Hz.

So h ν = 6.626e-34 J s * 6.366e13 Hz ≈ 6.626e-34 *6.366e13 = let's compute: 6.626 *6.366 ≈42.26. So 42.26e-21 = 4.226e-20 J.

Comparing ΔE_rot (≈9.196e-23 J) and ΔE_vibr (≈4.226e-20 J). Oh, so the rotational transition requires much less energy. Therefore, the photon should cause a transition in the rotational state.

Wait, but wait: in the rigid rotor model, the energy levels are quantized, and transitions can occur between rotational states. But wait, the molecule is in the fundamental state, which is J=0 and v=0. The next state with the lowest energy would be either J=1 (since J has to increase by 1) or v=1.

But the rotational transition requires much less energy. So the photon's energy would match the rotational energy difference, not the vibrational. So the photon's energy should be equal to ΔE_rot = 2B.

But wait, the question is about the momentum of the photon. Because photons have energy E = p c, where p is momentum and c is the speed of light. So we need to calculate p = E / c.

Wait, no, wait. For a photon, the energy is E = h f = p c, where p is the momentum. So p = E / c.

So if the photon's energy is ΔE_rot = 2B = 9.196e-23 J, then p_photon = (9.196e-23 J) / (3e8 m/s) ≈ 3.065e-31 kg m/s.

Wait, but looking at the options, none of them are this small. The options are on the order of 1e-28 to 1e-27 Ns. Wait, 1 Ns is 1 kg m/s. So our calculated p is 3e-31 kg m/s, which is 3e-31 Ns. But the options are much larger. Hmm, perhaps I did something wrong in the calculations.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the vibrational transition instead. Because the rotational change requires a smaller energy, but perhaps the question refers to the fundamental vibrational state, meaning the molecule is in v=0 and J=0, and the next state is v=1 and J=0? Or perhaps the next state is either changing J or v, but the way the question is phrased, it's the next state with the lowest possible energy. So perhaps it's the next higher state, which could be either J=1 (with v=0) or v=1 (with J=0). Since the rotational transition needs less energy, the photon energy should match that. But that gives a momentum much lower than any of the options.

Wait the options are A) 1.9e-28, B)2.3e-27, C)1.1e-27, D)1.4e-28. So my calculation gives about 3e-31 kg m/s, which is 3e-31 Ns. None of the options match. So what did I do wrong?

Wait, maybe I should have considered that the molecule absorbs a photon that changes both the rotational and vibrational states. But that would require more energy. Alternatively, perhaps the model here is not the rigid rotor, but the non-rigid rotor model, but I'm not sure how that changes things. Hmm, the question mentions the non-rigid rotor model, which is also known as the rotation-vibration model. So perhaps the energy levels account for both rotation and vibration.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the molecule is in the ground vibrational state (v=0) and the ground rotational state (J=0). The next possible state is the first excited state, which could be either v=1 (with J=0) or J=1 (v=0). The question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the lowest energy increase would be the rotational transition since ΔE_rot is smaller than ΔE_vibr.

Wait, but I'm getting a momentum that's way too small. Let me recheck my calculations.

Let me recompute B again.

B = h²/(8 π² I)

h = 6.626e-34 J s

h squared: (6.626e-34)^2 = approx 4.39e-67 J² s².

I is the moment of inertia. I = μ R².

μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My) = (20 * 2) / (22) = 40/22 ≈ 1.818 amu.

Convert amu to kg: 1 amu ≈ 1.6605e-27 kg. So μ = 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 ≈ 3.024e-27 kg.

R is 2 angstroms = 2e-10 meters. R² = 4e-20 m².

So I = 3.024e-27 kg * 4e-20 m² = 1.2096e-46 kg m².

So B = (6.626e-34)^2 / (8 π² * 1.2096e-46 )

Compute denominator: 8 π² ≈ 78.9568, multiplied by I=1.2096e-46 → 78.9568 *1.2096e-46 ≈ 95.4e-46 = 9.54e-45.

So numerator is 4.39e-67.

So B = 4.39e-67 / 9.54e-45 = approx 4.39e-67 / 9.54e-45 ≈ 4.39 / 9.54 = 0.46 * 1e-22 → 4.6e-23 J.

So 2B is 9.2e-23 J.

Photon energy E_photon = 9.2e-23 J.

Momentum p = E / c = 9.2e-23 J / 3e8 m/s = 3.07e-31 kg m/s = 3.07e-31 N s.

But the options don't have anything near that. So perhaps I'm approaching this wrong.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the molecule moving from the lowest state (v=0, J=0) to the next state which is the lowest in energy, which would be the first vibrational state (v=1), regardless of rotation. Because the vibrational energy is quantized and the next state is v=1, perhaps the rotational state remains the same. Because the rotational state can't be lower than J=0.

Wait, but no, because the molecule may have higher J, but that would require more energy. So if the photon provides just enough energy to make the transition to v=1, which is higher than any rotational transition, but maybe that's the only possibility.

Wait, perhaps the minimum energy increase is the vibrational one, even though it's higher. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering a transition from the (v=0, J=0) state to the (v=0, J=1) state, but that would require less energy.

Wait, but in that case, the photon energy would be 2B, which is much less than the vibrational energy. So why isn't that one of the options?

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the transition from the ground state to the next possible state, which could be either a vibrational or rotational state, but the photon's energy must match the higher of the two? Or perhaps it's a question about the photon causing a transition to the next state, which could be either, but the problem is asking for the photon's momentum when the transition is to the next state with the lowest possible energy.

Wait, if the photon's energy is the minimum possible to cause a transition, that would be the rotational one, requiring less energy. But the way the question is phrased, it says "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy." Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the energy levels of the combined rotation and vibration. So the energy of the state is E_total = E_vibr + E_rot. The ground state is (v=0, J=0), and the next state is (v=0, J=1), which has higher energy, but perhaps it's the next state with the lowest possible energy. Alternatively, the next state could be (v=1, J=0), which would have higher energy than (v=0, J=1), depending on the values.

Wait, let's compute both possible ΔE.

ΔE for (v=0, J=0) → (v=0, J=1): ΔE_rot = 2B = 9.196e-23 J.

ΔE for (v=0, J=0) → (v=1, J=0): ΔE_vibr = h ν = 4.226e-20 J.

So the rotational transition requires less energy. So the molecule would prefer to transition to the next state with the lowest possible energy, which is the rotational one. So the photon's energy must be 2B.

But again, the momentum comes out to be 3.07e-31 Ns, which isn't any of the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of B.

Wait, perhaps I used the wrong formula for B. Let me double-check the formula for the rotational constant. B is given by B = h/(8 π² I c), no, wait, no, that's the formula for the rotational partition function, maybe. Or perhaps I'm mixing different expressions.

Wait, no, the rotational energy levels are given by E_J = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant, which is defined as B = (h²)/(8 π² I). So that's correct.

Wait, but perhaps I should have used the vibrational energy in ergs or another unit? No, because all my calculations are in SI units.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about the Raman transition, which allows for changing J by ±2, but that might not be relevant here.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is considering the transition from the (v=0, J=0) state to (v=1, J=1), but that's a combination and requires both a vibrational and rotational change. But that would require more energy, so it's unlikely to be the lowest.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering that the molecule cannot have J=0 when v=0, but that's not correct because J can be zero regardless of v.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the energy levels as a combination of both rotational and vibrational energies. The total energy is the sum.

So the ground state is E0 = E_v=0 + E_J=0 = (1/2 h ν) + 0.

The next state could be either E1 = (3/2 h ν) + 0 (v=1, J=0) or E1 = (1/2 h ν) + 2B (v=0, J=1).

Which of these is lower? Let's compare 3/2 h ν and 2B.

h ν is 4.226e-20 J, so 3/2 h ν is 6.339e-20 J. 2B is 9.196e-23 J.

So 2B is way smaller than 3/2 h ν. So the next state with the lowest possible energy would be E_J=1, v=0.

So the photon must have energy 2B = 9.196e-23 J. Then, p = E / c = 9.196e-23 / 3e8 = 3.065e-31 kg m/s = 3.065e-31 Ns.

But the options are all higher. So perhaps I made a mistake in calculating B.

Wait, perhaps I should have used the bond length in meters correctly. Let me recheck R. R is 2 angstroms, which is 2e-10 meters. Wait, yes, so R squared is (2e-10)^2 =4e-20 m².

Wait, maybe the mistake is in the calculation of B. Let me try another approach.

Compute B again: B = h²/(8 π² I)

h = 6.626e-34 J s.

h squared is (6.626e-34)^2 = approx 4.38e-67 J² s².

I is 1.2096e-46 kg m².

So denominator is 8 π² I = 8 * (9.8696) * 1.2096e-46 ≈ 78.9568 *1.2096e-46 = approximately 95.4e-46 = 9.54e-45.

So B = 4.38e-67 / 9.54e-45 ≈ 4.59e-23 J.

Wait, that's correct.

So 2B is 9.18e-23 J.

E_photon = 9.18e-23 J.

p = E_photon / c = 9.18e-23 /3e8 ≈ 3.06e-31 kg m/s = 3.06e-31 Ns.

But none of the options match.

Wait, perhaps I'm supposed to calculate the vibrational transition. Because maybe the molecule is already in the lowest rotational state, and the next state is the vibrational one. But that would require a higher energy, but perhaps that's what the question is expecting.

If I calculate E_photon = h ν = 4.226e-20 J.

Then p = 4.226e-20 /3e8 ≈ 1.408e-28 kg m/s = 1.408e-28 Ns.

Looking at the options, option D is 1.4e-28. So that's close.

But why would the photon cause a vibrational transition instead of a rotational one?

Wait, perhaps the molecule is in the ground vibrational state (v=0) and the ground rotational state (J=0), and the next state is the first vibrational excited state (v=1, J=0), which has higher energy than the (v=0, J=1) state. But the question states "the next state with the lowest possible energy," which would be the (v=0, J=1) state.

Unless the question is considering that rotational transitions are not allowed in the model.

Wait, the question states it's modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model (non-rigid rotor), which includes both rotation and vibration. So rotational transitions are allowed. So why would the photon's momentum be for a vibrational transition?

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula for the energy difference. For a vibrational transition from v=0 to v=1, the energy difference is h ν, but for a rotational transition from J=0 to J=1, the energy is 2B. So the photon's energy should be 2B.

But in that case, the momentum is 3e-31 Ns, which isn't an option. So maybe the question is asking about the vibrational transition instead.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the problem considers the energy levels for vibration and rotation separately, and the next state is the combination where either J or v increases, whichever requires the least energy. So the photon's energy is the minimum of 2B and h ν.

In that case, 2B is smaller, so the energy is 2B. But again, that gives a p of 3e-31 Ns, not matching any option.

Wait, perhaps the question is actually referring to the rigid rotor model, which ignores vibration. But no, the question says non-rigid rotor, so it's considering both.

Hmm, perhaps the problem expects me to calculate the vibrational transition, which would match option D. So I must have made a mistake in the calculation for B.

Wait, perhaps I should recheck all the steps. Let me recompute B again.

I = μ R². μ = (20 * 2)/(22) = 40/22 ≈ 1.818 amu = 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg ≈ 3.024e-27 kg.

R = 2e-10 m. R² = (2e-10)^2 =4e-20 m².

I = 3.024e-27 kg *4e-20 m² = 1.2096e-46 kg m².

B = h²/(8 π² I) = (6.626e-34)^2 / (8 π² *1.2096e-46 )

Compute numerator: (6.626e-34)^2 = approx 4.39e-67.

Denominator: 8 * π^2 ≈ 8 *9.8696 =78.9568. 78.9568 *1.2096e-46 = approx 95.38e-46 = 9.538e-45.

So B = 4.39e-67 /9.538e-45 = 4.39e-67 /9.538e-45 = (4.39 /9.538) *1e-22 = 0.46e-22 =4.6e-23 J.

So 2B is 9.2e-23 J.

Hmm, so that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the photon to have energy equal to the vibrational energy, which is h ν.

h ν = 6.626e-34 * (4e14)/(2π) → Wait, no. Wait, w is given as 4e14 rad/s, so ν = w/(2π) = 4e14/(6.283) ≈ 6.366e13 Hz.

So h ν = 6.626e-34 *6.366e13 = approx 4.225e-20 J.

So p_photon = 4.225e-20 /3e8 ≈ 1.408e-28 kg m/s =1.408e-28 Ns.

Looking at the options, option D is 1.4e-28 Ns.

But why would the photon cause a vibrational transition when a rotational transition is possible and requires less energy? Because the problem states it's the next state with the lowest possible energy, which would be the rotational one. So perhaps the options are incorrect, but given the options, the only matching value is option D.

Wait, but the options have a higher value than my calculation for the vibrational transition. Wait, 1.4e-28 is option D.

But if the question expects the vibrational transition, then the answer is D.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is looking for the photon to cause the molecule to transition to the next vibrational state, not considering rotation. So in that case, the photon's energy is h ν, and the momentum is 1.4e-28 Ns.

But why would the next state not be the rotational one, which has lower energy? Because the rotational transition is allowed and requires less energy.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that in the non-rigid rotor model, the transitions involve both rotation and vibration. But in that case, the energies would be additive, but the question asks for the lowest possible energy change, which would be the smallest ΔE, which is 2B. But that again gives a p of 3e-31 Ns, which is not an option.

Wait, perhaps the problem is not considering rotation at all. Maybe it's a simple diatomic model where only vibration is considered, and the question is about a photon causing a vibrational transition. But the question states it's the rotation-vibration model, so that's probably not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about the fundamental state, which is the first vibrational state (v=0), and the next state is the first rotational state (J=1), but that's not correct because the ground state is v=0, J=0.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the options again. The only option that matches the vibrational transition is D) 1.4e-28 Ns. So perhaps the answer is D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the momentum of the photon required for the diatomic molecule to transition to the next state with the lowest possible energy, we analyze the energy differences for both rotational and vibrational transitions.

### Key Data:
- **Mass of X (Mx):** 20 amu  
- **Mass of Y (My):** 2 amu  
- **Bond length (R):** 2 Å = \(2 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m}\)  
- **Angular frequency (\(w\)):** \(4 \times 10^{14} \, \text{rad/s}\)  

### Step 1: Reduced Mass and Moment of Inertia
The reduced mass \(\mu\) is calculated as:
\[
\mu = \frac{M_x \cdot M_y}{M_x + M_y} = \frac{20 \cdot 2}{20 + 2} = \frac{40}{22} \approx 1.818 \, \text{amu}.
\]
Converting to kg (\(1 \, \text{amu} \approx 1.6605 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}\)):
\[
\mu \approx 1.818 \cdot 1.6605 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg} \approx 3.024 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}.
\]

The moment of inertia \(I\) is:
\[
I = \mu R^2 = 3.024 \times 10^{-27} \cdot (2 \times 10^{-10})^2 = 3.024 \times 10^{-27} \cdot 4 \times 10^{-20} = 1.2096 \times 10^{-46} \, \text{kg} \cdot \text{m}^2.
\]

### Step 2: Rotational Constant (\(B\))
The rotational constant \(B\) is given by:
\[
B = \frac{h^2}{8 \pi^2 I},
\]
where \(h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J} \cdot \text{s}\). Substituting:
\[
B = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})^2}{8 \pi^2 (1.2096 \times 10^{-46})}.
\]
First, calculate the numerator:
\[
h^2 = (6.626 \times 10^{-34})^2 \approx 4.39 \times 10^{-67} \, \text{J}^2 \cdot \text{s}^2.
\]
The denominator is:
\[
8 \pi^2 I = 8 \cdot (9.8696) \cdot 1.2096 \times 10^{-46} \approx 95.4 \times 10^{-46} = 9.54 \times 10^{-45}.
\]
Thus:
\[
B = \frac{4.39 \times 10^{-67}}{9.54 \times 10^{-45}} \approx 4.6 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}.
\]

### Step 3: Energy Differences
- **Rotational transition (\(J = 0 \to J = 1\)):**
  \[
  \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = 2B = 2 \cdot 4.6 \times 10^{-23} = 9.2 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}.
  \]
- **Vibrational transition (\(v = 0 \to v = 1\)):**
  The vibrational frequency \(\nu\) is:
  \[
  \nu = \frac{w}{2\pi} = \frac{4 \times 10^{14}}{6.283} \approx 6.366 \times 10^{13} \, \text{Hz}.
  \]
  The energy difference is:
  \[
  \Delta E_{\text{vibr}} = h \nu = (6.626 \times 10^{-34}) \cdot (6.366 \times 10^{13}) \approx 4.226 \times 10^{-20} \, \text{J}.
  \]

### Step 4: Minimum Energy Transition
The rotational transition requires significantly less energy (\(9.2 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}\)) compared to the vibrational transition (\(4.226 \times 10^{-20} \, \text{J}\)). However, none of the provided options match the momentum corresponding to the rotational transition (\(p = \Delta E / c \approx 3.07 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{Ns}\)).

Given the options, the only plausible match is the vibrational transition, which corresponds to:
\[
p = \frac{\Delta E_{\text{vibr}}}{c} = \frac{4.226 \times 10^{-20}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 1.4 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{Ns}.
\]
