Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question is asking for the maximum speed of a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator. The setup is that the oscillator has mass m and maximum amplitude A, and it obeys Hooke's law, which is F = -kx. Oh wait, but it's relativistic, so I can't just use the classical equations of motion; I need to consider relativistic effects.

In the non-relativistic case, the maximum speed would occur when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. For a harmonic oscillator, the potential energy at maximum displacement A is (1/2)kA². The kinetic energy is (1/2)mv². So setting them equal: (1/2)kA² = (1/2)mv² → v² = (kA²)/m → v = sqrt(kA²/m) = A√(k/m). That's option C, but wait, that's the non-relativistic case. Since the problem is relativistic, I can't just use that.

Relativistically, the energy considerations change. The total energy E of the oscillator would be the sum of the rest mass energy and the kinetic energy. But wait, in the case of a harmonic oscillator, the potential energy varies with position, and at maximum displacement, all the energy is potential. So in this case, the total energy is the potential energy at A, which is (1/2)kA². But in relativity, energy is more complicated. 

In special relativity, the total energy is given by E² = (pc)² + (mc²)². But for a harmonic oscillator, the energy is quantized, but this question seems more about the classical case. Hmm, maybe I should think in terms of relativistic energy expressions.

Wait, the maximum speed occurs when the kinetic energy is maximum. But wait, in the oscillator, when the object is at the maximum displacement A, all the energy is potential. As it moves towards the equilibrium, potential energy converts to kinetic. So the maximum kinetic energy is (1/2)kA², but wait, that's in the classical sense. In relativity, we have to consider the relativistic kinetic energy.

Wait, no. Let me clarify. In the classical case without relativity, the maximum speed is when all potential energy turns into kinetic. But when we have relativity, the expression for kinetic energy is different. The relativistic kinetic energy is (γ-1)mc², where γ is the Lorentz factor, γ = 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So at maximum speed, the kinetic energy is (γ -1)mc², and this should equal the potential energy at maximum displacement, which is (1/2)kA².

So equation: (γ -1)mc² = (1/2)kA².

Solve for γ. Let me rearrange:

γ = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)

Wait, but wait, let me think. The potential energy in the harmonic oscillator is (1/2)k x². At maximum amplitude x=A, so it's (1/2)kA². So the equation is:

(γ - 1) m c² = (1/2)k A² → γ = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Hmm, but then what's the next step? We need to find v_max. Since γ is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²), we can write:

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)

Wait, that seems a bit off. Let me represent (k A²)/(2 m c²) as a term, like let's say (k A²)/(2 m c²) = x. So then:

γ = 1 + x.

So 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + x.

Taking reciprocal on both sides:

sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1/(1 + x) → 1 - v²/c² = 1/(1 + x)^2.

So v²/c² = 1 - 1/(1 + x)^2.

Hmm, let's compute that.

1 - 1/(1 + x)^2 = [ (1 + x)^2 - 1 ] / (1 + x)^2.

Expanding the numerator: (1 + 2x + x² -1 ) = 2x + x².

So v²/c² = (2x + x²) / (1 + x)^2.

Factor numerator: x (2 + x) / (1 +x)^2.

Wait, but x is (k A²)/(2 m c²). So substituting x,

v² = c² [ (2x + x²) / (1+x)^2 ) ]

Alternatively, maybe I can find v in terms of x.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to rearrange the equation for v.

Let me write:

γ = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

But γ = 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So 1/sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Let me square both sides:

1/(1 - v²/c²) = [1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)]^2.

Let me denote (k A²)/(2 m c²) = y for simplicity.

Then,

1/(1 - v²/c²) = (1 + y)^2.

So 1 - v²/c² = 1/(1 + y)^2 → v²/c² = 1 - 1/(1 + y)^2.

Which simplifies to v²/c² = [ (1 + y)^2 -1 ] / (1 + y)^2.

The numerator is (1 + 2y + y² -1 ) = 2y + y² → y(2 + y) → y (y + 2).

So v²/c² = y (y + 2) / (1 + y)^2.

But y is (k A²)/(2 m c²). Let's plug that in:

v²/c² = [ (k A²/(2 m c²)) ( (k A²/(2 m c²)) + 2 ) ] / (1 + (k A²/(2 m c²)))^2.

This looks complicated, but maybe it can be simplified.

Let me compute the numerator and denominator:

Numerator: y (y + 2 ) = (k A²/(2 m c²)) * [ (k A²/(2 m c²)) + 2 ]

Denominator: (1 + y)^2 → [1 + (k A²/(2 m c²))]^2.

Hmm, perhaps I can factor it out differently.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write 1 + y = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) = (2 m c² + k A²) / (2 m c²).

Wait, so the denominator becomes [ (2 m c² + k A²) / (2 m c²) ]^2.

So:

v²/c² = [ y (y + 2) ] / [ ( (2 m c² + k A²)/(2 m c²) )^2 ]

Wait, perhaps I should instead let’s go back to the equation 1/(1 - v²/c²) = (1 + y)^2 → v²/c² = 1 - 1/(1 + y)^2.

So v = c * sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + y)^2 )

Which can be written as v = c * sqrt( [ (1 + y)^2 - 1 ] / (1 + y)^2 )

Which is the same as: c * sqrt( (2y + y²) ) / (1 + y )

Because (1 + y)^2 -1 = 2y + y².

Now, sqrt(2y + y²) = sqrt(y (y + 2)).

So,

v = c * sqrt( y (y + 2) ) / (1 + y )

But y is (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Putting it back in:

v = c * sqrt( [ (k A²)/(2 m c²) ) ( (k A²)/(2 m c²) + 2 ) ] ) / ( 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) )

Hmm, let me simplify the denominator: 1 + y = (2 m c² + k A²) / (2 m c² )

So denominator is (2 m c² + k A²)/(2 m c²).

So,

v = c * [ sqrt( y (y +2 ) ) ] / ( (2 m c² + k A²)/(2 m c²) )

Which is, v = c * [ sqrt(y(y + 2)) ] * (2 m c²) / (2 m c² + k A² )

Hmm, now, let me compute the numerator inside the square root: y(y + 2) = [ (k A²)/(2 m c²) ] * [ (k A²)/(2 m c²) + 2 ]

Wait, perhaps it's better to factor out 2 m c² from the terms.

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let me consider that the total energy E is the sum of rest mass energy and kinetic energy. At maximum displacement, all the energy in the oscillator is potential energy. So E = (1/2)k A². But in relativity, E is the total energy, which is gamma mc².

Wait, but that's a different approach. Let me see.

In the oscillator, the maximum potential energy is (1/2)kA². At that point, the kinetic energy is zero, so the total energy is (1/2)kA². But in relativity, the total energy is gamma mc². So,

gamma mc² = (1/2) k A².

So,

gamma = (k A²)/(2 m c²) → Wait, is that correct? Wait, (1/2)k A² = gamma mc² → gamma = (k A²)/(2 m c²) * (1/2)? No, wait no. Wait,

(1/2) k A² = gamma mc² → gamma = (k A²)/(2 m c²) * (1/2)^{-1} → No, wait, wait. Let me recompute:

Gamma = (1/2) k A² / (m c² )

Wait, (1/2)kA² = gamma m c² → gamma = (1/2 k A² )/( m c² )

But wait, that can't be right because in the non-relativistic case, gamma is 1. Let's check when k A² is small compared to 2 m c². Let me consider when k A²/(2 m c²) is small, which would be the non-relativistic limit.

In non-relativistic case, potential energy is (1/2)k A², which equals the kinetic energy at maximum speed. So, in non-relativistic, the maximum speed is sqrt( (k A²)/(m) ). Let's see what my current approach gives in that limit. If y = (k A²)/(2 m c²) is small, then gamma = 1 + y.

So, for small y,

gamma ≈ 1 + y.

So, 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) ≈ 1 + y → sqrt(1 - v²/c²) ≈ 1/(1 + y ) ≈ 1 - y, using the approximation 1/(1 + ε) ≈ 1 - ε for small ε.

So,

1 - v²/c² ≈ 1 - 2 y → v²/c² ≈ 2 y → v ≈ c sqrt(2 y) = c sqrt( 2 * (k A²)/(2 m c²) ) = c sqrt( (k A^2) / (m c²) ) ) = sqrt( k A^2 / (m c^2) ) * c.

Wait, sqrt(k A^2/(m c^2)) is sqrt( (k/m) (A^2/c^2) ), which is sqrt( (k/m) ) * (A / c )

But then sqrt( (k/m) ) is sqrt( (k/m) ), and when multiplied by c, we get sqrt( k/m ) * A.

Wait, but that's the non-relativistic case. Let me compute it:

sqrt( (k A²)/(2 m c²) ) * sqrt(2) * c = ?

Wait, perhaps I'm getting lost in the algebra here. Let's get back. In the non-relativistic limit, y = (k A²)/(2 m c²) is very small, so y << 1.

So, the expression for v_max in the non-relativistic case is sqrt( (k A²)/m ). Let me see what each option gives in the non-relativistic limit.

Option C is v = sqrt( k A²/m ), which matches the non-relativistic case. So, in the non-relativistic limit, the correct answer should reduce to C. But since the question is relativistic, the correct answer can't be C. So option C is the non-relativistic case, but the question is asking for the relativistic case.

Looking at the options, option A is:

v_max= c sqrt( 1 + 1/(1 - (k A²)/(2 m ))^2 )

Wait, but the denominator inside the square root is (1 - (k A²)/(2 m c² ))^2 ?

Wait, let me read the options again.

Option A: v_max= c√[1 + 1/(1 - (kA²)/(2m) )² ]

Wait, but the units don't match. (k A²)/(2m) would have units of (N·m²)/(kg) → (kg·m/s² * m² ) / kg ) → m^3/s² → which doesn't make sense for a dimensionless denominator inside the square root. So there must be a typo in the options, perhaps. Or perhaps it's (k A²)/(2 m c² ), but let me look.

Looking at the options:

Option A: denominator is (1 - (kA²)/(2m)), but that would have units of (kg·m/s² * m²)/(kg) → (kg·m³/s² )/kg → m³/s², which isn’t dimensionless. So that can't be correct. So perhaps the right option should have (k A^2)/(2 m c² ), which is dimensionless.

Looking at option B: denominator is (1 - (kA²)/(2 m c² )).

So the denominator is 1 - (k A²)/(2 m c² ), which is dimensionless.

Option B: v_max= c√[1 + 1/(1 - (kA²)/(2 m c² )) ]

Wait, no, option B says 1 + 1/(1 - (kA²)/(2 m c² )). So let's compute that for small y.

Wait, y = (k A²)/(2 m c²). So for small y, 1/(1 - y) ≈ 1 + y + y² + ... So 1 + 1/(1 - y) ≈ 1 + (1 + y) ) = 2 + y.

So for small y, option B's expression becomes v_max ≈ c sqrt( 2 + y ), which for small y would be sqrt( 2 ), which doesn't match the non-relativistic case which is sqrt( (k A^2)/m ) → which is much larger than sqrt(2) times c. So that can't be correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me think again.

Wait, in the non-relativistic case, the maximum speed is when all potential energy is converted into kinetic. So, (1/2)k A² = (1/2) m v² → v = sqrt( k A²/m ). So in the options, option C is v_max = sqrt(k A^2/m), which is correct in the non-relativistic case.

But the question is about the relativistic case, so that's the correct approach when speeds are a significant fraction of c.

So, going back to the equation we had earlier:

gamma = 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

gamma = 1/ sqrt(1 - v²/c²) → sqrt(1 - v²/c² ) = 1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )).

So, 1 - v²/c² = 1/(1 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) )^2.

Rearranged to v²/c² = 1 - [1/(1 + y )^2 ], where y = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ).

So,

v²/c² = [ (1 + y )^2 - 1 ] / (1 + y )^2

= [1 + 2y + y² - 1 ] / (1 + y )^2

= (2y + y² ) / (1 + y )^2.

Factor numerator: y(2 + y )

So,

v²/c² = y(2 + y ) / (1 + y )^2.

But y = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ), so let me write it:

v²/c² = [ (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) * (2 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )) ] / [ (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 ]

Simplify numerator:

(k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) * [ (4 m c^2 + k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 ) ) ]

Wait, 2 + (k A²)/(2 m c^2 ) = [ (4 m c^2 ) + k A^2 ]/(2 m c^2 )

So,

numerator becomes [ (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) ) * (4 m c^2 + k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 ) ) ]

Denominator is [ (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 ) ) ]^2 → (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2 / (2 m c^2 )^2.

Putting it all together,

v²/c² = [ (k A^2 (4 m c^2 + k A^2 ) ) / ( (2 m c^2 )^2 * (2 m c^2 ) ) ) ] / [ (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2 / (2 m c^2 )^2 ) ]

Wait, perhaps I'm getting tangled. Let me compute numerator and denominator step by step.

Numerator:

N = [ (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) ] * [ (4 m c^2 + k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 ) ) ]

= (k A^2)(4 m c^2 + k A^2 ) / ( (2 m c^2 )^2 )

Denominator:

D = [ (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 ) ) ]^2 = (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2 / (2 m c^2 )^2.

So,

v²/c² = (N) / (D) = [ (k A^2 (4 m c^2 + k A^2 )) / (2 m c^2 )^2 ] / [ (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2 / (2 m c^2 )^2 )

= [ k A^2 (4 m c^2 + k A^2 ) ] / [ (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2 ]

Hmm, perhaps I can factor this differently. Let me write 4 m c^2 = 2*(2 m c^2 ), so:

N = k A² (2*(2 m c^2 ) + k A² )

D = (2 m c^2 + k A² )^2.

So,

v²/c² = [ k A² (2*(2 m c^2 ) + k A² ) ] / (2 m c^2 + k A² )^2.

Wait, perhaps this can be written as [ (k A^2) * (2 (2 m c²) + k A^2 ) ] / ( (2 m c² + k A^2 )^2 )

Which is [ 2 m c² * k A^2 + (k A^2 )^2 ] / ( (2 m c² + k A^2 )^2 )

But I'm not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, perhaps I can factor out (2 m c^2 + k A^2 ) in the numerator.

Wait, the numerator is k A^2 ( 4 m c^2 + k A^2 )

Which is k A^2 [ 2 (2 m c^2 ) + k A^2 ]

The denominator is (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2.

Hmm, perhaps I can write the numerator as:

k A^2 [ 2 (2 m c^2 ) + k A^2 ] = 2 (2 m c^2 ) k A^2 + k^2 A^4.

Wait, but I'm not seeing a clear simplification here. Maybe another approach is needed.

Wait, perhaps I can factor the denominator as (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2.

So,

v²/c² = [ k A^2 (4 m c^2 + k A^2 ) ] / ( (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2 )

= [ k A^2 ( 2*(2 m c^2) + k A^2 ) ] / ( (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2 )

= [ 2 (2 m c^2 ) k A^2 + k^2 A^4 ] / ( (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2 )

Hmm, perhaps I can factor out (2 m c^2 + k A^2 ) in the numerator.

Wait, let me see: The numerator is (2 m c^2 ) * k A^2 * 2 + k^2 A^4.

Wait,

= 2 (2 m c^2 ) k A^2 + k^2 A^4 = k A^2 [ 2 (2 m c^2 ) + k A^2 ].

But denominator is (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2 = [ (2 m c^2 ) + k A^2 ]^2.

So,

v²/c² = [ k A^2 (2 (2 m c^2 ) + k A^2 ) ] / [ (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2 ]

= [ k A^2 ( 2 (2 m c^2 ) + k A^2 ) ] / [ (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2 ]

Hmm, perhaps I can write it as:

v²/c² = [ 2 (2 m c^2 ) k A^2 + k^2 A^4 ] / ( (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2 )

Which is,

= [ 2 (2 m c^2 ) k A^2 ] / ( (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2 ) + [ k^2 A^4 ] / ( (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2 )

But I'm not seeing an obvious simplification. Maybe I should consider another approach.

Wait, perhaps I can write the denominator as (2 m c² + k A² )^2 = ( (2 m c² ) + (k A²) )^2.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about the options again.

Option D: v_max= c√[1 - 1/(1 + (kA^2/(2 m c^2 )) )^2 ]

Wait, because from earlier steps, v²/c² = 1 - [1/(1 + y )^2 ] where y= (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 )

So,

v²/c² = 1 - [1/(1 + y )^2 ] = [ (1 + y )^2 - 1 ] / (1 + y )^2.

Which is the same as (2y + y²)/(1 + y )^2.

Which is:

v = c * sqrt( (2y + y² )/(1 + y )^2 ) )

= c * sqrt( (y (2 + y )) ) / (1 + y )

So,

v = c * sqrt( y (y + 2 ) ) / (1 + y )

Substituting y = (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 ), we have:

v = c * sqrt( [ (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 ) * ( (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 ) + 2 ) ] ) / (1 + (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 ) )

Hmm, perhaps this can be expressed as:

v = c * sqrt( [ (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 ) * ( 2 + (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 )) ] ) / (1 + (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 ) )

Which simplifies to:

v = c * sqrt( [ (k A^2 (2 * 2 m c^2 + k A^2 )) ] / ( (2 m c^2 )^2 (1 + (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 ))^2 ) )

Wait, perhaps I'm getting stuck in the algebra. Let me look at the options again.

Looking at option D: v_max= c√[1 - 1/(1 + (kA²/(2 m c² )) )^2 ]

Which is,

v/c = sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + y )² ) → which is exactly what I have. Because earlier, we found that v²/c² = 1 - 1/(1 + y )², where y = (k A²)/(2 m c^2 ). So,

v = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + y )² ), which is option D.

So option D is the correct expression.

Wait, but let me double-check.

Option D says:

v_max= c√[1 - 1/(1 + (kA^2/(2 m c^2 )) )^2 ]

Which is exactly what I derived, so that's the correct answer.

Wait, but earlier I thought when y is small, the non-relativistic limit would apply. Let me see what happens when y is small. Let's take y << 1, so (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) <<1.

Then,

v/c = sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + y )² ) ≈ sqrt( 1 - (1 - 2y + 3 y² - ... ) )

Because 1/(1+y)^2 ≈ 1 - 2y + 3 y² - ... for small y.

So,

1 - 1/(1 + y )^2 ≈ 2y - 3 y² + ...

But for small y, higher order terms can be neglected, so approx 2y.

Thus,

v ≈ c sqrt(2 y ) = c sqrt( 2 * (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )) ) = c sqrt( (k A^2)/(m c^2 ) ) = sqrt( k A^2 / m ) = sqrt( k/m ) A.

Which is exactly the non-relativistic case. So this confirms that option D reduces to the correct non-relativistic case.

So the correct answer is D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the maximum speed \( v_{\text{max}} \) of a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass \( m \), maximum amplitude \( A \), and obeying Hooke's law \( F = -kx \), we consider the relativistic energy relationships. The total energy of the oscillator is the sum of its rest mass energy and kinetic energy. At maximum displacement \( A \), all the energy is potential energy, given by \( E = \frac{1}{2}kA^2 \). This energy is also the total energy in relativity, which is expressed as \( E = \gamma mc^2 \), where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \) is the Lorentz factor.

Equating the potential energy to the total relativistic energy:

\[
\gamma mc^2 = \frac{1}{2}kA^2 \implies \gamma = \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}.
\]

Substituting \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \), we get:

\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}.
\]

Rearranging for \( v^2/c^2 \):

\[
1 - v^2/c^2 = \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}.
\]

Simplifying further:

\[
v^2/c^2 = 1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}.
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}}.
\]

This matches the form of option D. To confirm, we check the non-relativistic limit where \( \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \ll 1 \). In this case:

\[
v_{\text{max}} \approx c \sqrt{2 \cdot \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}} = \sqrt{\frac{kA^2}{m}},
\]

which reduces to the classical result for maximum speed, ensuring consistency.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: D**
