Okay, so I've got this question here about a Lagrangian and determining the mass dimension of a coupling constant and whether the theory is renormalizable. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The Lagrangian given is L_int = κψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. Oh wait, σ_{μν} is (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]. Right, because the commutator of gamma matrices gives the sigma terms, which are antisymmetric.

First, I remember that for a Lagrangian to be renormalizable, the dimension of the coupling constant should be such that the interaction terms have mass dimension 4, same as the free terms in the Lagrangian. Because in 4 spacetime dimensions, the action is dimensionless, so each term in the Lagrangian density must have mass dimension 4.

But wait, each term in the Lagrangian density must have dimension 4 because the integral over d^4x makes the action dimensionless. So each individual term's dimension is 4.

So I need to find the mass dimension of κ. To do that, I'll have to figure out the dimensions of each part of the term in the Lagrangian.

Let's break down the term: κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}.

First, I should recall the dimensions of the fields. Fermion fields ψ have mass dimension 3/2 each because in 4D, a Dirac spinor has dimension (4-1)/2 = 3/2. So ψ̄ is also 3/2.

What about σ_{μν}? It's (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]. Since γ matrices are dimensionless (they're just matrices), the commutator is also dimensionless. So σ_{μν} has the same dimension as the tensor it's made from; but wait, since it's a tensor, but made from gamma matrices, which are dimensionless. So σ_{μν} is dimensionless? Or maybe because it's a product of gamma matrices, which are dimensionless, so σ is dimensionless.

Wait, no, maybe I should think about the term itself. Let's think of σ_{μν} as a product of derivatives? No, no, wait, σ is a product of gamma matrices, so it's actually a Lorentz tensor. Wait, no, σ is a product of gamma matrices, but in a certain way. Let's think about the dimensionality of each component.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the dimensions of each field in the term.

The term is ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}.

So each ψ̄ and ψ has dimension 3/2. So together, ψ̄ ψ would have dimension 3. Now, what's the dimension of F^{μν}? F is the field strength tensor for a gauge field, like electromagnetism. The field tensor F has dimension 2 because the gauge field A has dimension 1 (since A_mu is a vector potential, and the kinetic term is (1/4) F^2, so F must have dimension 2 because A has dimension 1: since ∂μ Aν has dimension 1+1=2, and F is ∂μ Aν - ∂ν Aμ, so F has dimension 2.

So F^{μν} has dimension 2.

Now, putting it all together: ψ̄ σ ψ F.

So, let's calculate the dimension of the product: [ψ̄][σ][ψ][F].

Each ψ̄ and ψ is 3/2. So ψ̄ σ ψ -> 3/2 + [σ] + 3/2. Wait, but σ is a tensor, but made from gamma matrices which are dimensionless, so σ_{μν} is a Lorentz tensor, but its dimension is actually 0 because it's a product of gamma matrices, which are dimensionless. Wait, is that right?

Wait, I think I might be mixing up things. Alternatively, perhaps σ_{μν} is dimensionless because it's constructed from gamma matrices, which are just matrices without any mass dimension. So [σ_{μν}] = 0.

So the product ψ̄ σ ψ F would have dimensions:

[ψ̄] = 3/2,

[σ] = 0,

[ψ] = 3/2,

[F] = 2.

So adding them up: 3/2 + 0 + 3/2 + 2 = 3/2 + 3/2 is 3, plus 2 is 5. So the total dimension is 5.

But wait, the term is κ times this product. The entire Lagrangian term must have dimension 4, because the Lagrangian density has dimension 4 in 4D spacetime. So:

[κ] * [ψ̄ σ ψ F] = 4.

We've calculated [ψ̄ σ ψ F] =5, so:

[κ] *5 =4 → [κ]=4/5? Wait, that can't be right because the options don't have 4/5. Hmm, did I make a mistake in the dimensions?

Wait, perhaps I messed up the dimensions of F. Let me think again. F is the field strength tensor for a gauge field. The gauge field A has dimension 1. F is ∂μ Aν - ∂ν Aμ, which would have the same dimension as ∂ A. The derivative ∂ has dimension 1, so ∂ A is dimension 1+1=2. So F has dimension 2. That's correct.

Wait, another approach: the term in the Lagrangian with F^2 has dimension 4. Because each F is dimension 2, so F^2 is dimension 4. So in (1/4) F^2, the term is dimension 4, so that's okay.

Now the term in question is ψ̄ σ F ψ. Let's check each field:

ψ̄: 3/2,

σ: 0,

F: 2,

ψ: 3/2.

So their product: 3/2 + 3/2 + 2 = 3 + 2 = 5. So the product has dimension 5. The Lagrangian term is κ multiplied by this, so [κ *5 ] must be 4. So [κ] =4/5? But this gives [κ]=4/5, which is not an option. Hmm. The options are about [κ] being -1 or 1.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in calculating the dimension of F. Let me check.

The field strength F is a tensor, and in 4D spacetime, the gauge field A has dimension 1. So F, being the derivative of A minus the derivative of A, has dimension 1 (A) +1 (derivative) =2. So [F]=2. That's correct.

Wait, perhaps the term is not ψ̄ σ F ψ, but perhaps I forgot the sigma's structure. Wait, σ is a product of gamma matrices, which are dimensionless, but in terms of the term, does the σ carry any tensor indices that might affect the dimension? No, because in the Lagrangian, the indices are contracted, so the dimension comes from the fields, not the sigma tensor.

Wait, another approach: Let's compute the dimension of the entire term. The term is κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}.

Each ψ has dimension 3/2, so ψ̄ ψ is (3/2)*2=3.

F^{μν} has dimension 2.

Now, σ_{μν} is a Lorentz tensor, but it's made from gamma matrices, which are dimensionless. So σ_{μν} is dimensionless.

So the product ψ̄ σ ψ F is 3 (from ψ̄ ψ) + 2 (F) =5.

So the entire term κ * (ψ̄ σ ψ F) has dimension [κ] +5 =4 (since Lagrangian terms must be dim 4).

So [κ] +5 =4 → [κ]=4-5 = -1.

Ah, so the mass dimension of κ is -1. Now, the next part is whether the theory is renormalizable.

Renormalizability depends on the coupling's dimension. In 4D, a theory is renormalizable if the coupling has mass dimension >=0.

The dimension of κ is -1, which is less than 0. So the theory is not renormalizable. Because for renormalizability, the coupling must have non-negative mass dimension, so that the interaction terms don't have higher dimension than 4.

So putting it together: [κ]=-1 and the theory is not renormalizable.

Looking at the options:

Option C: [κ]=-1. Not renormalizable.

Yes, that's option C.

To determine the mass dimension of the coupling constant $\kappa$ and whether the theory is renormalizable, we analyze the given Lagrangian:

\[
\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}} = \kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu},
\]
where $\sigma_{\mu\nu} = \frac{i}{2}[\gamma_\mu, \gamma_\nu]$.

### Step 1: Mass dimensions of the fields
- The Dirac spinor field $\psi$ has mass dimension $[\psi]_M = \frac{3}{2}$.
- The adjoint spinor $\bar{\psi}$ also has $[\bar{\psi}]_M = \frac{3}{2}$.
- The field strength tensor $F^{\mu\nu}$ for a gauge field has mass dimension $[F]_M = 2$.
- The tensor $\sigma_{\mu\nu}$ is constructed from the commutator of dimensionless gamma matrices $\gamma_\mu$, so $[\sigma_{\mu\nu}]_M = 0$.

### Step 2: Dimension of the interaction term
The interaction term is $\kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu}$. The mass dimension of the product of fields is:
\[
[\bar{\psi}]_M + [\psi]_M + [\sigma_{\mu\nu}]_M + [F]_M = \frac{3}{2} + \frac{3}{2} + 0 + 2 = 5.
\]
The Lagrangian density must have mass dimension $4$ in 4 spacetime dimensions. Therefore, the coupling constant $\kappa$ must satisfy:
\[
[\kappa]_M + 5 = 4 \implies [\kappa]_M = -1.
\]

### Step 3: Renormalizability
A theory is renormalizable in 4 dimensions if the coupling constants have non-negative mass dimensions. Since $[\kappa]_M = -1 < 0$, the theory is **not renormalizable**.

### Conclusion
The mass dimension of $\kappa$ is $-1$, and the theory is not renormalizable.
