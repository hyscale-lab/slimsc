Alright, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, okay, let's see what it's about. The question is about finding the uncertainty in the P_z operator. I remember that the uncertainty is calculated using the formula ΔP_z = sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²). So I need to find the expectation values of P_z and P_z squared for the given state.

The system is in an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ. The state is given as a column vector (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z, which means the matrix representations are in that basis.

First, let me write down the state. So the state vector is ψ = [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ]^T. I think I need to calculate ⟨P_z⟩ and ⟨P_z²⟩ for this state.

Wait, but P_z is given. Let me look at P_z's matrix form. It has components: first row [ħ, 0, 0], second [0,0,0], third [0,0,-ħ]. So the diagonal elements are ħ, 0, and -ħ. Oh, wait, because the basis is the eigenvectors of P_z, right? So each basis vector corresponds to an eigenvalue of P_z. So the diagonal elements are the eigenvalues.

So the eigenstates of P_z would be |+z⟩, |0z⟩, |-z⟩, with eigenvalues ħ, 0, and -ħ respectively. So the state ψ is expressed in this basis.

So the state ψ is a linear combination of these basis vectors. Let me write it as ψ = a|+z⟩ + b|0z⟩ + c|-z⟩. Looking at the components, a is -1/2, b is 1/√2, and c is -1/2.

Wait, but when calculating expectation values, since the basis vectors are the eigenstates of P_z, things might simplify. Because P_z acting on |+z⟩ gives ħ |+z⟩, same for the others.

The expectation value ⟨P_z⟩ is given by ψ† P_z ψ. Since P_z is diagonal in this basis, this should be a* ħ a + b* *0* b + c* * (-ħ) c. Wait, but a, b, c are the coefficients in the state. So let's compute that.

But wait, the state is given as (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2)^T. So a = -1/2, b = 1/√2, c = -1/2. Since the basis is orthonormal, the expectation value is a* * (ħ a) + b* * 0 * b + c* * (-ħ) c.

Wait, but since all the a, b, c are real numbers here, the complex conjugate doesn't matter. So let's compute each term:

First term: a^2 * ħ = ( (-1/2)^2 ) * ħ = (1/4) ħ.

Second term: b^2 * 0 = 0.

Third term: c^2 * (-ħ) = ( (-1/2)^2 ) * (-ħ) = (1/4) * (-ħ) = -ħ/4.

Wait, but wait, shouldn't the third term be c * (eigenvalue) * c? Because it's the coefficient times the eigenvalue. Oh, but wait, the third basis vector is |-z⟩ with eigenvalue -ħ. So the term is c^2 * (-ħ). Oh, I think I got that right.

So adding up the terms: (1/4 ħ) + 0 + (-1/4 ħ) = 0. So ⟨P_z⟩ is zero. That simplifies things a bit.

Now I need ⟨P_z²⟩. Since P_z squared is just the square of the operator, but since P_z is diagonal, P_z² is just the squares of the diagonal elements. So the matrix for P_z² is [ (ħ)^2, 0, 0; 0, 0, 0; 0,0, (-ħ)^2 ]. Which is [ ħ², 0, 0; 0,0,0; 0,0, ħ² ].

So the expectation value ⟨P_z²⟩ would be the sum of a^2*(ħ^2) + b^2*(0) + c^2*(ħ^2). Let me compute that.

a^2 is (1/4) and multiplied by ħ² gives (1/4) ħ².

b^2 is (1/2), but multiplied by 0 gives 0.

c^2 is (1/4) multiplied by ħ² gives (1/4) ħ².

Adding them all: (1/4 + 0 + 1/4) ħ² = (1/2) ħ². So ⟨P_z²⟩ = (1/2) ħ².

So now, the uncertainty ΔP_z is sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²) = sqrt( (1/2 ħ²) - 0 ) = sqrt( (1/2) ħ² ) = (ħ) / sqrt(2).

Wait, looking at the options, option B is ħ/sqrt(2), and option C is ħ/2. So I think the answer is B.

But wait, let me double-check. Oh, wait, the state vector's elements are (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). Let me make sure I squared them correctly.

a is (-1/2), so a^2 is (1/4). c is (-1/2), same as a. So each contributes (1/4) ħ². So together, 1/4 + 1/4 is 1/2. So yes, ⟨P_z²⟩ is (1/2) ħ².

So uncertainty is sqrt(1/2 ħ²) = ħ / sqrt(2), which is option B.

To calculate the uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ of the operator $P_z$, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

### Step 1: Compute $\langle P_z \rangle$
The state of the system is given as $\psi = \begin{bmatrix} -1/2 \\ 1/\sqrt{2} \\ -1/2 \end{bmatrix}$, expressed in the eigenbasis of $P_z$. The eigenvalues of $P_z$ are $\hbar$, $0$, and $-\hbar$ for the three basis vectors. The expectation value $\langle P_z \rangle$ is computed as:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = a^2 \cdot \hbar + b^2 \cdot 0 + c^2 \cdot (-\hbar),
\]

where $a = -1/2$, $b = 1/\sqrt{2}$, and $c = -1/2$. Substituting the values:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 \cdot \hbar + \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2 \cdot 0 + \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 \cdot (-\hbar).
\]

Simplifying:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \frac{1}{4} \hbar + 0 - \frac{1}{4} \hbar = 0.
\]

### Step 2: Compute $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$
The operator $P_z^2$ is diagonal with elements $\hbar^2$, $0$, and $\hbar^2$ in the eigenbasis of $P_z$. The expectation value $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$ is:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = a^2 \cdot \hbar^2 + b^2 \cdot 0 + c^2 \cdot \hbar^2.
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 \cdot \hbar^2 + \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2 \cdot 0 + \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 \cdot \hbar^2.
\]

Simplifying:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{1}{4} \hbar^2 + 0 + \frac{1}{4} \hbar^2 = \frac{1}{2} \hbar^2.
\]

### Step 3: Compute $\Delta P_z$
Using the formula for uncertainty:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2} \hbar^2 - 0} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2} \hbar^2} = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ is $\frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}$, which corresponds to option **B**.
