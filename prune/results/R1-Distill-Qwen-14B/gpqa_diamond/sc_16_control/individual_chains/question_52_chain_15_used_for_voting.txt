Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand.

So the question is about a star that has some dark spots on its surface. When the spots aren't there, the effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K, and the star's radius is 1.5 solar radii, and it's 1.1 solar masses. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. 

The main point is about the ratio of neutral Titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels: level 1 and level 2. When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. The question asks by what factor this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does. The transition between these levels is at about 1448 Å, which is in the near-ultraviolet range, I think.

Hmm, I remember that in stellar atmospheres, the distribution of atoms between energy levels is governed by the Boltzmann equation under Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), as the problem states. The Boltzmann factor says that the ratio of populations (n1 and n2) is proportional to exp(-ΔE/(kT)), where ΔE is the energy difference between the levels, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

Wait, wait. The ratio is n1/n2. The Boltzmann equation is n_i/n_j = (g_i/g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) ). So, if level 1 is lower energy than level 2, then E_i (level 2) is higher than E_j (level 1). So ΔE would be E2 - E1, which is positive. So the exponent is (-ΔE)/(k T). 

But wait, the problem says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when Teff is lower (5500 K), the ratio is lower. That suggests that the ratio is n1/n2, and when T decreases, this ratio decreases. Alternatively, maybe it's the other way around. Let me think.

Wait, if the star's photosphere is hotter, then higher energy levels are more populated. So if the temperature is higher, the population in higher levels (like level 2) increases relative to lower levels (level 1). So the ratio n1/n2 would decrease as temperature increases. 

In this problem, when the star has spots, the effective temperature of the photosphere is lower (5500 K) compared to when it's spotless (6000 K). So spotless case is higher temperature. So, the ratio n1/n2 would be higher in the hotter case (because higher T means more level 2 population, so n1/n2 is lower) but wait wait. Let me think again.

If the star is hotter, the exponent is less negative, so the ratio n1/n2 = (g1/g2) exp( - (E1 - E2)/(k T) ). Wait, no. Because if E2 > E1, then E1 - E2 is negative, so the exponent becomes positive. So n1/n2 = (g1/g2) exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) ), which is the same as (g1/g2) exp( ΔE/(k T) ). If ΔE is positive, as temperature increases, the ratio increases because the exponent increases. So higher T would mean higher n1/n2. 

Wait, that doesn't seem right because I thought higher T would make the higher energy levels more populated. So if level 2 is higher than level 1, then n2 is larger when T is higher. So n1/n2 would be smaller when T is higher. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake with the signs.

Wait, let's clarify. The Boltzmann distribution says that the population of a higher energy level is proportional to exp( - E/(kT) ). So the ratio of populations is (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E1 - E2)/(k T) ) ), which is the same as (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) ). If E2 > E1, then (E2-E1) is positive, so the exponent is positive. As T increases, the exponent increases, so the ratio n1/n2 increases. But if the temperature increases, higher energy levels are more populated. So n2 should be greater than n1, so n1/n2 is less than 1. So when T increases, n1/n2 would decrease if g1/g2 is 1. Wait, no. Wait, let me take a concrete example.

Suppose E2 = E1 + ΔE. So E2 > E1. Then, n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (ΔE)/(k T) ). So as T increases, the exponent (ΔE/(k T)) decreases, because T is in denominator. So the exponential term becomes smaller. So n1/n2 would decrease as T increases. 

Wait, but higher T would mean that the relative population of higher energy levels increases. So n2 would be higher than n1, so n1/n2 is less than 1 and would decrease as T increases. So when the star is hotter (no spots), the ratio n1/n2 is lower than when it's cooler (with spots). But the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So when the star has spots, the Teff is lower (5500 K), so the ratio is lower. That contradicts my previous thought.

Wait, no: the problem says when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So spotless case (6000 K) has a higher ratio than when it's spotted (5500 K). Because when the star is cooler, n1/n2 is higher. So when the star is hotter (no spots), the ratio is lower. So when the star has spots, the ratio is higher? No, the problem says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. Wait, the question says: "the ratio decreases when the star has spots." So when it's spotted, the ratio is lower than when it's spotless.

Wait, that's confusing. Let me re-read. When the star has spots, the overall Teff is 5500 K, and the ratio is observed to be lower. So spotless case (6000 K) has a higher ratio than spotted case (5500 K). So at higher T, the ratio is higher? Wait, no, that can't be. Because according to the Boltzmann equation, higher T would lead to lower n1/n2 ratio. So if when the star is hotter, the ratio is lower, but the problem says when the star has spots, the ratio is lower. So when it's cooler (spots), the ratio is lower than when it's hotter (no spots). Hmm, no, I'm getting mixed up.

Wait, perhaps I should just approach it with the equations. Let me write down the ratio.

n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1) / (k T) )

If E2 > E1, then (E2-E1) is positive. So when T increases, the exponent (positive) divided by T increases. So the exponent increases, so exp becomes larger. So n1/n2 increases with T. So at higher T, the ratio n1/n2 is higher. 

Wait, but that can't be correct because higher T should make higher energy levels more populated. So n2 would be higher than n1, so n1/n2 is less than 1. If T increases, n1/n2 increases, but it's still less than 1. So for example, when T is very high, n1/n2 approaches (g1/g2). But if T is low, the exponent is small, so the ratio is lower.

Wait, but that's not making sense with the actual physical situation. Let me think: when T is higher, more energy, so more atoms in higher energy levels. So n2 is bigger, so n1/n2 is smaller. So the ratio n1/n2 should decrease with higher T. But my equation says it increases. So I must have made a mistake in the equation.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The Boltzmann equation is:

n_i / n_j = (g_i / g_j) * exp( - (E_i - E_j) / (k T) )

If E_i > E_j, then E_i - E_j is positive, so the exponent is negative. So n_i/n_j is (g_i/g_j) multiplied by a small number (since exp of negative is <1). So n_i/n_j is smaller than (g_i/g_j). 

Wait, so if I have two energy levels, level 1 is lower (E1), level 2 is higher (E2). So E2 > E1. Then n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

So n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

So if T increases, the exponent becomes less negative, so exp(-x) is larger. So n2/n1 increases with higher T. So n2/n1 is higher when the star is hotter (no spots), meaning n1/n2 is lower. 

So when the star has spots, Teff is lower (5500 K), so n2/n1 is lower than when T is 6000 K. So n1/n2 ratio is higher when T is lower.

But the problem states that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So when the star has spots, the ratio is lower than when it's spotless. But according to the equation, when T is lower, n1/n2 is higher. So this seems contradictory. Hmm.

Wait, am I getting the ratio backwards? The problem says the ratio of n1/n2 decreases when the star has spots. So, when the star is hotter, the ratio is larger, and when cooler, it's smaller. Wait, but according to the equation, when T increases, n1/n2 decreases. So higher T (no spots) would have smaller n1/n2 ratio. So when the star has spots (cooler), the ratio is higher. But the problem says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So I'm getting conflicting information here. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, the problem says "the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energetic levels (level 1 and level 2), astronomers have observed that this ratio decreases when the star has spots." So when the star has spots, the ratio is lower than when it doesn't.

So when the star is cooler (with spots), the ratio is lower. Which implies that when T decreases, n1/n2 decreases.

But according to the Boltzmann equation, if E2 > E1, then n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) ). So as T decreases, (E2 - E1)/(k T) increases, so the exponent increases, so exp(...) increases, making n1/n2 larger. So when T is lower (with spots), the ratio n1/n2 should be larger. But the problem says the ratio decreases. So that's a contradiction.

Hmm. So perhaps I have the levels reversed. Maybe level 1 is higher than level 2. Let me suppose that level 1 is higher energy than level 2. So E1 > E2. So the energy difference is E1 - E2 = ΔE, which is positive. 

Then, the ratio n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) ) = (g1/g2) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

So as T increases, the exponent becomes less negative, so the ratio increases. So n1/n2 increases with T.

But if the star is hotter, the ratio is higher. So when the star has spots (cooler), the ratio is lower. That aligns with the problem statement. So this suggests that level 1 is higher than level 2. So in that case, the ratio n1/n2 is higher at higher temperatures. So when the star is hotter, n1 is more populated relative to n2 than when it's cooler. 

Wait, but wait. If level 1 is higher, then higher T would make n1/n2 higher, meaning more population in level 1 than level 2, which is the opposite of what I would expect because higher T should populate higher energy levels. But in this case, if level 1 is higher, then higher T would make level 1 more populated, so n1/n2 increases. So the ratio would be higher when T is higher, which matches the problem statement that when the star has spots, the ratio is lower.

So, the conclusion is that the ratio n1/n2 increases with temperature if E1 > E2. Therefore, in the problem, when the star is hotter (no spots: 6000 K), the ratio is higher than when it's cooler (spots:5500 K). So the ratio decreases when the star has spots, which matches the problem statement. 

So, now I need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots (T=6000 K) compared to when it does (T=5500 K). So the factor is (n1/n2)_6000 / (n1/n2)_5500.

But wait, the ratio when the star has spots is lower, so this factor would be greater than 1. Let's compute this.

The ratio R(T) = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1) / (k T) )

Wait, but since E2 < E1 in this scenario, E2 - E1 is negative, so (E2 - E1)/(k T) is negative. So R(T) = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) ) = (g1/g2) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

But wait, if I'm considering the ratio n1/n2, and level 1 is higher than level 2, then E2 < E1, so ΔE = E1 - E2 is positive. So the exponent is -ΔE/(k T). So R(T) = (g1/g2) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

Wait, but originally, I thought the ratio was (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) ), which would be (g1/g2) exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), since E2 < E1. 

So R(T) = (g1/g2) exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

So the ratio when the star is spotless (T1=6000 K) is R1 = (g1/g2) exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

And when it has spots (T2=5500 K), R2 = (g1/g2) exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

So the factor is R1/R2 = [exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) ] / [ exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) ] 

= exp( [ -ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) ] )

= exp( ΔE/(k) [ 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ] )

So, the factor is exp[ ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ]

Wait, but we can compute this using the wavelength given. The transition corresponds to wavelength λ=1448 Å. So the energy difference is given by ΔE = hc/λ.

Where h is Planck's constant, c is speed of light.

So, ΔE = (6.626e-34 J s)(3e8 m/s) / (1448e-10 m) 

Let me compute that. Let's compute the numerator first.

h*c = 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J m.

λ = 1448 Å = 1448e-10 m = 1.448e-7 m.

So ΔE = 1.9878e-25 J m / 1.448e-7 m = (1.9878 / 1.448) * 1e-18 J.

1.9878 / 1.448 ≈ 1.372.

So ΔE ≈ 1.372e-18 J per photon.

Now, k is Boltzmann's constant, 1.38e-23 J/K.

So the exponent becomes:

(ΔE/(k)) [ (1/T2) - (1/T1) ) ]

Putting in the numbers:

ΔE/(k) = (1.372e-18 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) 

= (1.372 / 1.38) * 1e5 K

≈ 0.994 * 1e5 ≈ 9.94e4 K.

Wait, 1e5 is 10^5, so 9.94e4 is approximately 99,400 K.

Now, T1 is 6000 K, T2 is 5500 K.

Compute (1/T2 - 1/T1) = (1/5500 - 1/6000) K^-1.

Compute 1/5500 ≈ 0.000181818 K^-1.

1/6000 ≈ 0.000166667 K^-1.

So the difference is 0.000181818 - 0.000166667 ≈ 0.000015151 K^-1.

So (ΔE/(k)) * (1/T2 - 1/T1) ≈ 9.94e4 K * 0.000015151 K^-1.

Multiplying these together:

9.94e4 * 1.5151e-5 = (9.94 * 1.5151) * 1e-1.

9.94 * 1.5151 ≈ let's compute:

10 * 1.5151 =15.151. Subtract 0.06 *1.5151≈0.0909. So approx 15.151-0.0909≈15.06.

Multiply by 1e-1: 1.506.

So the exponent is approximately 1.506.

So the factor is exp(1.506) ≈ e^1.506.

e^1 is 2.718, e^1.5 is about 4.4817. e^1.506 is a bit higher.

Let me compute it more accurately.

e^1.506 ≈ ?

We know that e^1.5 ≈4.4817.

The difference is 1.506 -1.5=0.006.

e^0.006≈1 +0.006 + (0.006^2)/2 + ... ≈1.006018.

So e^1.506 ≈4.4817 *1.006018≈4.4817 + (4.4817 *0.006018)= approx 4.4817 + 0.02696 ≈4.5086.

So the factor is approximately 4.5.

Looking at the options, option C is ~4.5.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check the calculations because I might have made a miscalculation in the exponents.

Wait, when we calculated (1/T2 -1/T1):

1/5500 = 0.000181818 ≈ 1.81818e-4,

1/6000 ≈ 1.66667e-4.

Difference is 1.5151e-5.

Wait, earlier I said 1.5151e-5, but let me compute 1/5500 -1/6000:

(6000 -5500)/(5500 *6000) = 500/(33,000,000) = 5e2/(3.3e7) )= 5e2/(3.3e7) = 5/(33000) ≈ 1.51515e-5.

So that's correct.

So, (ΔE/k)= ~9.94e4 K, multiplied by 1.51515e-5 K^-1:

9.94e4 * 1.51515e-5 = (9.94 *1.51515) * 1e-1.

Compute 9.94 *1.51515:

Let me compute 10 *1.51515=15.1515.

Subtract 0.06 *1.51515 ≈0.0909.

So 15.1515 -0.0909≈15.0606.

Multiply by 1e-1: 1.50606.

So exponent is 1.50606. e^1.50606 is around 4.5.

So the factor is about 4.5, which is option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the factor by which the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels changes when the star transitions from being spotless (Teff = 6000 K) to having spots (Teff = 5500 K), we use the Boltzmann equation under Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). The ratio of populations is given by:

\[
\frac{n_1}{n_2} = \frac{g_1}{g_2} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT}\right),
\]

where \( \Delta E \) is the energy difference between the two levels, \( k \) is Boltzmann's constant, and \( T \) is the temperature. The factor by which the ratio changes is:

\[
\text{Factor} = \frac{\left(\frac{n_1}{n_2}\right)_{6000}}{\left(\frac{n_1}{n_2}\right)_{5500}} = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right).
\]

### Step 1: Compute \( \Delta E \)
The energy difference \( \Delta E \) is derived from the wavelength of the transition (\( \lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å} \)):

\[
\Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda},
\]

where \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \) (Planck's constant) and \( c = 3.0 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \) (speed of light). Converting \( \lambda \) to meters:

\[
\lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å} = 1448 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m} = 1.448 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m}.
\]

Now calculate \( \Delta E \):

\[
\Delta E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3.0 \times 10^8)}{1.448 \times 10^{-7}} = \frac{1.9878 \times 10^{-25}}{1.448 \times 10^{-7}} \approx 1.372 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J}.
\]

### Step 2: Compute \( \Delta E / k \)
Boltzmann's constant is \( k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K} \). Thus:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} = \frac{1.372 \times 10^{-18}}{1.38 \times 10^{-23}} \approx 9.94 \times 10^4 \, \text{K}.
\]

### Step 3: Compute \( \frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} \)
The temperatures are \( T_1 = 6000 \, \text{K} \) and \( T_2 = 5500 \, \text{K} \). Calculate:

\[
\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} = \frac{1}{5500} - \frac{1}{6000}.
\]

Convert to decimal form:

\[
\frac{1}{5500} \approx 1.818 \times 10^{-4}, \quad \frac{1}{6000} \approx 1.667 \times 10^{-4}.
\]

Subtract:

\[
\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} = 1.818 \times 10^{-4} - 1.667 \times 10^{-4} = 1.515 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{K}^{-1}.
\]

### Step 4: Compute the exponent
The exponent is:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right) = (9.94 \times 10^4)(1.515 \times 10^{-5}) = 1.506.
\]

### Step 5: Compute the factor
The factor is:

\[
\text{Factor} = \exp(1.506).
\]

Using \( \exp(1.506) \approx 4.5 \).

### Conclusion
The ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in the two energy levels decreases by a factor of approximately 4.5 when the star transitions from being spotless to having spots.
