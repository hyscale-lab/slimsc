Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about relativistic speeds and energy for two astronauts. Hmm, I remember from my studies that when objects are moving at speeds close to the speed of light, you have to use special relativity formulas. Let me think through this step by step.

The problem says there are two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. I'm supposed to find the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

Wait, the relative speed isn't just the difference in their speeds because we're dealing with relativity. Oh right, you can't just subtract velocities in relativity; you have to use the velocity addition formula. So the formula for relative velocity u' when one frame is moving at speed v relative to another is u' = (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/c²), but wait, I'm getting confused. Let me make sure. Oh wait, no. Wait, the velocities of the two objects are u and v. So the relative velocity from the perspective of the first astronaut (the one moving at 0.6c) would be (v - u)/(1 - (u*v)/(c²)), but wait, which one is u and which is v?

Wait, let me clarify. Let's say the first astronaut (A) is moving at u = 0.6c relative to the Earth. The second astronaut (B) is moving at v = 0.5c relative to Earth. So, from A's perspective, what is B's speed?

No, wait, actually, the relative speed between A and B would be (v_B - v_A) / (1 - (v_B v_A)/c²). Wait, no, because A is moving at 0.6c, and B is moving at 0.5c in the same direction. So from A's frame, B is moving at (0.5c - 0.6c) / (1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/c²) )= (-0.1c) / (1 - 0.3 c² / c² ) = (-0.1c) / (0.7) )= approx -0.1428c. But relative speed is the magnitude, so 0.1428c, which is about 0.14c. So the relative speed would be approximately 0.14c.

Wait, but wait, the options say 0.14c in options C and D. So the relative speed is either option C or D.

Now for the total energy of the system. For each astronaut, their relativistic kinetic energy is given by gamma times mc², but wait, the total energy would be the sum of their rest energy plus kinetic energy, or just the sum of their energies. Wait, no. Each has rest mass, and their energies are their relativistic energies.

So each astronaut's energy is gamma * m_i c², where m_i is their rest mass.

Wait, the first astronaut has mass 2m, moving at 0.6c. So gamma1 is 1/sqrt(1 - (0.6c)^2/c²) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.

So energy E1 = gamma1 * 2m c² = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

Second astronaut has mass 3m, moving at 0.5c. Gamma2 is 1/sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547.

So E2 = gamma2 * 3m c² ≈ 1.1547 * 3m c² ≈ 3.464 m c².

Total energy E_total = E1 + E2 ≈ 2.5 + 3.464 = 5.964 m c², which is about 5.96 mc². So looking at options, option C has E=5.96 mc^2 and v_rel=0.14c.

Option D has E=5 mc^2 which is less, so probably not.

So the relative speed is ~0.14c and the total energy ~5.96 mc². So the correct option is C.

To solve the problem, we analyze the relative speed and total energy of the system using relativistic mechanics.

### Relative Speed
The relative speed between the two astronauts is calculated using the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{v_B - v_A}{1 - \frac{v_A v_B}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \(v_A = 0.6c\) and \(v_B = 0.5c\). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.5c - 0.6c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{-0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{-0.1c}{0.7} \approx -0.1428c
\]

The negative sign indicates the direction, but the relative speed is the magnitude, so:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} \approx 0.14c
\]

### Total Energy of the System
The total energy of the system is the sum of the relativistic energies of the two astronauts. The relativistic energy of an object is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

For the first astronaut (mass \(2m\), speed \(0.6c\)):

\[
\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25
\]

\[
E_1 = \gamma_1 (2m) c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2
\]

For the second astronaut (mass \(3m\), speed \(0.5c\)):

\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]

\[
E_2 = \gamma_2 (3m) c^2 \approx 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464m c^2
\]

The total energy of the system is:

\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 \approx 2.5m c^2 + 3.464m c^2 \approx 5.964m c^2 \approx 5.96m c^2
\]

### Final Answer
The relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\), and the total energy of the system is approximately \(5.96m c^2\). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:
