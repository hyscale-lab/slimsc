Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem states that we have a solution with a volume of 200.00 cm³, which is 200 mL. It contains 1.00 gram of KH2PO4 and 1.00 gram of Na2HPO4·2H2O. We need to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions (HPO4^2- I think) in the solution. The temperature is given as 25°C, which is standard, so I don't think I need to adjust for temperature effects or anything.

The options are all in the order of 1e-7 M, so I guess the answer is going to be a very small concentration.

First, I remember that KH2PO4 is potassium hydrogen phosphate, and Na2HPO4·2H2O is sodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate. Both of these are related to phosphate ions. Phosphoric acid (H3PO4) has three dissociation steps, each with their own Ka values.

The Ka values given are:
Ka1 = 7.5e-3 (for H3PO4 → H+ + H2PO4^-)
Ka2 = 6.2e-8 (H2PO4^- → H+ + HPO4^2-)
Ka3 = 1.8e-12 (HPO4^2- → H+ + PO4^3-)

So, the problem is about finding the concentration of HPO4^2- ions in the solution.

Wait, but wait—when you mix KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4, that's a buffer solution for the second dissociation step (Ka2). Because KH2PO4 is H2PO4^- and Na2HPO4 is HPO4^2-.

So, in such a buffer, the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- are determined by the amounts of each salt added.

I think the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation would be useful here. The equation is pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]). In this case, the base would be HPO4^2- and the acid would be H2PO4^-.

But wait, wait—since we're looking for the concentration of HPO4^2-, maybe we can compute it using the amounts of each salt.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Calculate the moles of KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4.

2. Since these are in solution, each will dissociate into their respective ions.

3. Use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to relate the pH to the ratio of the concentrations.

4. Then find the concentration of HPO4^2-.

Wait, but first, let's compute the moles.

Molar masses are given: KH2PO4 is 136.09 g/mol, and Na2HPO4·2H2O is 177.99 g/mol.

Moles of KH2PO4: 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol ≈ 0.00734 mol.
Moles of Na2HPO4·2H2O: 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol ≈ 0.00561 mol.

Wait, let me calculate that more accurately.

For KH2PO4: 136.09 g/mol.

1.00 / 136.09 = approximately 0.00734 mol. Let me compute:

136.09 is about 136.1. So 1 / 136.1 = approx 0.007348, so 0.007348 moles.

For Na2HPO4·2H2O: 177.99 g/mol. 1.00 / 177.99 ≈ 0.005610 moles.

So, in solution, KH2PO4 would dissociate into K+ and H2PO4^-.

Na2HPO4·2H2O would dissociate into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2-.

So the moles of H2PO4^- from KH2PO4 are 0.007348 mol, and the moles of HPO4^2- from Na2HPO4 are 0.005610 mol.

But wait, wait. Are those the only sources? Since they're both in solution, yes.

Now, the solution volume is 200 mL, which is 0.200 liters.

So, the concentrations would be:

[H2PO4^-] = 0.007348 mol / 0.2 L ≈ 0.03674 M.

[HPO4^2-] = 0.005610 mol / 0.2 L ≈ 0.02805 M.

Wait, but the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-]).

So, I can compute the pH first, but wait, the problem doesn't give a pH. Hmm. So perhaps I can find the concentration of HPO4^2- using the buffer equation.

Alternatively, perhaps the solution is just a mixture of these two, and the concentrations are as I calculated, but since this is a buffer, the [HPO4^2-] is directly given by the moles divided by volume.

Wait, no. Because in the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, the ratio of the concentrations would relate to the pH, but without knowing the pH, how can I proceed?

Wait, perhaps the problem is expecting me to calculate [HPO4^2-] directly from the moles, but that can't be right because when you mix the two salts, the concentrations are determined by their amounts and the dissociation. But wait, maybe in this case, the solution is such that the HPO4^2- concentration is the same as calculated, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the pH of the solution using the buffer equation, and then find the concentration of HPO4^2- based on that.

Wait, but the question is about the concentration of HPO4^2- in the solution. So perhaps the initial approach is correct, but I'm missing something.

Wait, no. Because when you have a buffer solution of a weak acid and its conjugate base, the concentrations of the acid and base are determined by the amounts of each you add. So in this case, the solution is a buffer for the second dissociation (Ka2), where H2PO4^- is the acid and HPO4^2- is the conjugate base.

So, the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation would be:

pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-])

But without knowing the pH, how do I find [HPO4^2-]? Or maybe I can calculate the pH using this equation and then use it to find [HPO4^2-].

Wait, but the pH isn't given. So perhaps I'm supposed to assume that the solution is at pH = pKa2, making [HPO4^2-] equal to [H2PO4^-], but that would only be the case when pH = pKa2.

Wait, that's when the concentrations are equal, so then the log term is zero. But in this case, the concentrations aren't equal. So that can't be the case.

Hmm. Maybe I should use the buffer equation to find the pH, but since I don't have the pH, perhaps I can just compute the [HPO4^2-] from the given moles and volume.

Wait, but wait, perhaps the solution is more straightforward. Since the solution is a buffer, the [HPO4^2-] is just the moles divided by the volume, but I'm not sure if that's correct because the buffer equation involves the ratio of the concentrations.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a matter of finding the concentration of HPO4^2- as per the moles, but considering the dissociation.

Wait, perhaps I should proceed as follows.

First, compute the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- in the solution.

Molar amounts:

n(KH2PO4) = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol ≈ 0.007348 mol → H2PO4^- is 0.007348 mol.

n(Na2HPO4·2H2O) = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol ≈ 0.005610 mol → HPO4^2- is 0.005610 mol.

Volume is 0.200 L.

So,

[H2PO4^-] = 0.007348 / 0.2 = 0.03674 M.

[HPO4^2-] = 0.005610 / 0.2 = 0.02805 M.

But wait, considering the buffer solution, the pH is determined by these concentrations, but the problem is asking for [HPO4^2-], which I've already calculated.

But that seems too straightforward. The options are in the 1e-7 range, but 0.028 M is much bigger than that. So I must be making a mistake.

Wait a minute, perhaps I've misunderstood the problem. Oh wait! The question is asking for the concentration of orthophosphate ions. Orthophosphate is H3PO4, but wait, no, wait. Orthophosphate is the primary phosphate species, which is HPO4^2-? Or is it H2PO4^-? Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, I think orthophosphate generally refers to H3PO4, but that's the acid. Alternatively, sometimes HPO4^2- is called the orthophosphate ion. Wait, no, actually, orthophosphate is H3PO4, but in solution, it dissociates into H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, etc. But perhaps in this context, the question is referring to HPO4^2- as orthophosphate. Or maybe I'm getting that wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the total phosphate ions, but I think that's not the case. Let's proceed.

Wait, but the options are in the 1e-7 M range, which is much lower than my initial calculation of 0.028 M for [HPO4^2-]. So I must have made a mistake in my approach.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the dissociation steps more carefully.

Wait, H3PO4 is a triprotic acid. The first dissociation is H3PO4 → H+ + H2PO4^- (Ka1 = 7.5e-3).

The second is H2PO4^- → H+ + HPO4^2- (Ka2 = 6.2e-8).

The third is HPO4^2- → H+ + PO4^3- (Ka3 = 1.8e-12).

So, the phosphate species in solution would include H3PO4, H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, PO4^3-, but given the presence of KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4, which are H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- salts, respectively.

So the solution is a buffer for the second dissociation step, so the pH is around pKa2, which is about log(6.2e-8) ≈ 7.21.

But why would the concentration of HPO4^2- be so low as in the options? Because the moles I calculated gave a much higher concentration.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something else. Perhaps the solution isn't just a simple mixture of the two salts, and there's some hydrolysis or further dissociation happening.

Wait, maybe the problem is expecting me to consider that in solution, some of the H2PO4^- will dissociate into HPO4^2- and H+.

But if that's the case, then the initial concentrations I calculated would change due to this dissociation.

Alternatively, perhaps the solution is such that the H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- are in a buffer, and their concentrations are determined by the buffer equation.

Wait, let me think. The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation for the second dissociation is:

pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-])

But without knowing the pH, perhaps I can't proceed. Unless I can find the pH from another source.

Wait, but in a solution with both KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4, the solution should be at a pH where the buffer is effective, near pKa2. So perhaps I can calculate the pH first.

Wait, but I don't have the pH. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- are given by the amounts of the salts, and the solution is just their mixture.

Wait, but that can't be, because when you mix the salts, they dissociate completely, so [H2PO4^-] is from KH2PO4, and [HPO4^2-] is from Na2HPO4.

So, perhaps the [HPO4^2-] is indeed the amount from Na2HPO4 divided by the volume, which is around 0.028 M, but that's way higher than any of the options. So I must be making a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the salts. Let me recheck:

KH2PO4 is K+ and H2PO4^-.

Na2HPO4·2H2O is Na+ and HPO4^2-.

So yes, their moles are as I computed.

Wait a second, maybe the problem is that the solution is prepared with both these salts, and perhaps some HPO4^2- comes from the dissociation of H2PO4^-.

But wait, that would be the case if H2PO4^- is acting as an acid, donating a proton to become HPO4^2-.

But in a buffer solution, the ratio between HPO4^2- and H2PO4^- is determined by the pH and the pKa.

Wait, but without knowing the pH, I can't directly find that ratio. So perhaps the solution is expecting me to use the initial concentrations as the concentrations in the solution.

But the options suggest that [HPO4^2-] is about 1e-7 M, which is way lower than 0.028 M.

So I must have made a mistake. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the problem is not about the solution of the two salts but about the orthophosphate ion, which is PO4^3-.

Wait, but I thought orthophosphate is HPO4^2-.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is looking for the concentration of HPO4^2- in the solution, considering the dissociation of H2PO4^-.

Wait, but how would that work? Let me think.

In the solution, we have both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- ions. The H2PO4^- can further dissociate into H+ and HPO4^2-.

So, the total concentration of HPO4^2- would be the sum of the initial [HPO4^2-] from Na2HPO4 and the amount that comes from the dissociation of H2PO4^-.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the initial amount is much larger. So perhaps the [HPO4^2-] is dominated by the amount from Na2HPO4, but that would again give a much higher concentration than the options suggest.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscounting the moles. Let me recheck the moles.

Molar mass of KH2PO4 is 136.09 g/mol.

1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = approximately 0.007348 mol.

Similarly, Na2HPO4·2H2O is 177.99 g/mol.

1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol ≈ 0.005610 mol.

So, the moles are correct.

Wait, but perhaps I should consider that the solution isn't 200 mL but 200 cm³, which is the same, 0.2 L.

Wait, but then the concentrations are 0.03674 M and 0.02805 M, respectively.

So, perhaps the problem is expecting me to find the concentration of HPO4^2- after considering the buffer effect. But how?

Wait, let me think about the buffer equation again.

[HPO4^2-] / [H2PO4^-] = 10^(pH - pKa2)

If I can find the pH, then I can find the ratio, and thus find [HPO4^2-], but I don't have the pH.

Alternatively, perhaps the solution is that the pH is determined by the buffer, and given that, the [HPO4^2-] can be found.

Wait, but without knowing the pH, how can I proceed? I must be missing something.

Wait, perhaps the problem is simply to calculate the concentration of HPO4^2- from the moles and volume, which would be 0.005610 mol / 0.2 L = 0.02805 M, but that's way higher than any of the options. So perhaps that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the distribution of phosphate species at pH 25°C. Wait, but pH at 25°C is 7. So, I can use the Hendersen equation to find the ratio of [HPO4^2-] to [H2PO4^-] based on pH.

Wait, but pKa2 is about 7.21 (since Ka2 is 6.2e-8, pKa2 is log(1/(6.2e-8)) = log(1.6129e7) ≈ 7.21).

So, pH is 7, which is less than pKa2 of ~7.21. So, the pH is slightly below pKa2.

In the Henderson equation, 7 = 7.21 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-]).

So, log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-]) = 7 - 7.21 = -0.21.

So, [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] = 10^(-0.21) ≈ 0.617.

So, [HPO4^2-] = 0.617 * [H2PO4^-].

But wait, the initial concentrations from the salts are [H2PO4^-] = 0.03674 M and [HPO4^2-] = 0.02805 M.

Wait, but according to this, the ratio is [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] = 0.02805 / 0.03674 ≈ 0.763.

Which is a bit higher than the 0.617 calculated from pH=7.

So, that suggests that the actual concentrations would adjust to satisfy the buffer equation.

Wait, but this is getting complicated. Let me think of it as a buffer solution where the concentrations of the acid and base are determined by the amounts of the salts added.

In that case, the ratio [base]/[acid] is (moles HPO4^2-)/(moles H2PO4^-) = 0.005610 / 0.007348 ≈ 0.763.

Then, according to the Henderson equation, pH = pKa2 + log(0.763) ≈ 7.21 + log(0.763).

Log(0.763) is about -0.117, so pH ≈ 7.21 -0.117 ≈ 7.09.

But the problem states the solution is at 25°C, which is pH neutral (around 7), so this makes sense.

Wait, but the problem is asking for the concentration of HPO4^2- in the solution. From the salts, it's 0.02805 M, but considering the buffer, perhaps this is the main contribution.

But the options are way lower, so perhaps I'm approaching this the wrong way.

Wait, maybe the problem is asking for the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which is H3PO4.

Wait, but that's the acid form, which is less likely to be present in a solution with H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to calculate the concentration of PO4^3- (the phosphate ion), but that's even less likely because Ka3 is 1.8e-12, which is very small.

Hmm, perhaps I should calculate the concentration of HPO4^2- considering the dissociation of H2PO4^-.

Wait, but given that the solution is a buffer, the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- are determined by the amounts of KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4 added, respectively. So their concentrations are as I calculated earlier, 0.03674 M and 0.02805 M, respectively.

But that's way higher than the options. So perhaps I'm missing something in the problem statement.

Wait, let me read the problem again.

The solution has 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O. Volume is 200 cm³. Find concentration of orthophosphate ions.

Wait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting orthophosphate. Orthophosphate is the fully deprotonated form, PO4^3-.

Wait, but that's possible. Let me check.

If the question is about PO4^3-, then we'd have to consider the dissociation of HPO4^2- into PO4^3-.

But given that the Ka3 is 1.8e-12, which is very small, the concentration of PO4^3- would be minimal.

So, let's calculate that.

The concentration of HPO4^2- is 0.02805 M. The dissociation is:

HPO4^2- ↔ H+ + PO4^3-.

Ka3 = 1.8e-12.

So, the expression is Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-]/[HPO4^2-].

We can rearrange this to [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-])/[H+].

But [H+] can be found from the buffer solution.

Wait, but the buffer equation for pH is from the second dissociation.

Wait, earlier, I found that the pH is around 7.09.

So [H+] = 10^(-7.09) ≈ 8.21e-8 M.

So, [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02805) / 8.21e-8.

Let me compute that.

1.8e-12 * 0.02805 = 5.05e-14.

5.05e-14 / 8.21e-8 = approx 6.15e-7 M.

Hmm, that's about 6.15e-7 M, which is close to option A (6.24e-7) or option D (3.97e-7).

Wait, but I'm not sure if this is what the question is asking. The question says orthophosphate ions, which I thought was HPO4^2-, but if it's PO4^3-, then this would be the concentration.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to calculate the concentration of HPO4^2-.

But in that case, the initial approach would have given me 0.028 M, which isn't one of the options. So I must be missing something.

Wait, perhaps I'm supposed to consider that the solution isn't a buffer but that the phosphate ions are in their various forms, and the orthophosphate refers to H3PO4, but that's the acid form, which would be minimal in solution.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the total concentration of phosphate ions, including all species. But the options are way too low, so perhaps not.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the solution is not just a buffer but involves the hydrolysis of the salts.

Wait, for example, when you mix KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4, perhaps they form a buffer solution, and the pH is determined by the Henderson equation.

But since I can't find the pH, maybe I should find the ratio of [HPO4^2-] to [H2PO4^-], which is (moles HPO4^2-)/(moles H2PO4^-).

Which is 0.005610 / 0.007348 ≈ 0.763.

Then, using the Henderson equation, I can compute the pH.

But the problem is, I don't have the pH, but perhaps I can compute it and then find [HPO4^2-].

Wait, but without knowing the pH, how can I proceed?

Wait, maybe I'm getting stuck because the problem is straightforward, and I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again.

Wait, the problem gives the amounts of KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O, and asks for the concentration of orthophosphate ions (HPO4^2-).

So, perhaps the answer is simply the moles of HPO4^2- divided by the volume, which is 0.005610 mol / 0.2 L = 0.02805 M, but that's not one of the options. So perhaps I'm wrong.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the solution is made by mixing these two salts, and the orthophosphate is the HPO4^2- from Na2HPO4.

But that would give 0.028 M, which isn't among the options, so I must be missing something.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is expecting me to calculate the concentration of HPO4^2- after considering the dissociation of H2PO4^-.

In that case, the H2PO4^- (from KH2PO4) can dissociate into H+ and HPO4^2-, increasing the [HPO4^2-].

But then, the initial [HPO4^2-] is 0.02805 M, and the [H2PO4^-] is 0.03674 M.

So, using the Ka2 expression:

Ka2 = [H+][HPO4^2-] / [H2PO4^-]

But [H+] can be found from the buffer equation, which would be pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-]).

So, if I have [HPO4^2-] = x and [H2PO4^-] = y, then x/y = 10^(pH - pKa2).

But without knowing pH, it's hard to proceed.

Wait, but we can write two equations:

1. x = initial moles HPO4^2- / V + (moles H2PO4^- * α ), where α is the degree of dissociation of H2PO4^- into HPO4^2-.

But this might get complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to assume that the solution is a buffer and that [HPO4^2-] is as calculated from the moles.

But again, that brings me back to 0.028 M, which isn't an option.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the concentration of PO4^3- (the phosphate ion), which is the fully deprotonated form.

In that case, the concentration would be very low, as I calculated earlier (about 6.15e-7 M), which is close to option A (6.24e-7) or option D (3.97e-7).

But why would the question refer to orthophosphate as PO4^3-? I thought orthophosphate refers to HPO4^2-.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different definition. Let me check.

Upon a quick recollection, orthophosphate is the form HPO4^2-. So if the question is about HPO4^2-, then the concentration would be from the Na2HPO4·2H2O, which is 0.028 M, but that's not an option.

Hmm. I'm getting stuck here, so perhaps I should re-examine the problem.

Wait, the problem states that the solution contains 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O. So total phosphate from both is 2.00 grams.

Wait, but perhaps the problem is expecting me to calculate the concentration of PO4^3- (phosphate ion) which is the fully deprotonated form.

In that case, the concentration would be very low, as I calculated before.

But how?

So, let's proceed step by step.

Compute the moles of HPO4^2- from Na2HPO4·2H2O: 0.005610 mol.

Then, the concentration of HPO4^2- is 0.005610 / 0.2 = 0.02805 M.

Now, the dissociation of HPO4^2- to PO4^3- is governed by Ka3.

Ka3 = 1.8e-12.

The expression is:

Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-]/[HPO4^2-]

So,

[PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+]

But what is [H+] in the solution?

We can find [H+] using the buffer equation for the second dissociation.

The buffer equation is:

pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-])

We have [HPO4^2-] = 0.02805 M and [H2PO4^-] = 0.03674 M.

So,

log([0.02805]/[0.03674]) = log(0.763) ≈ -0.117.

pKa2 is log(1/(6.2e-8)) ≈ 7.207.

So,

pH = 7.207 - 0.117 ≈ 7.09.

So, [H+] = 10^(-7.09) ≈ 8.21e-8 M.

Now, substituting into [PO4^3-]:

[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02805) / 8.21e-8.

Let's compute that:

1.8e-12 * 0.02805 = 5.05e-14.

5.05e-14 / 8.21e-8 ≈ 6.15e-7 M.

Looking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7, which is very close to this value.

So, the concentration of PO4^3- (phosphate ions) would be approximately 6.15e-7 M, which aligns with option A.

But wait, the question refers to orthophosphate ions. I thought orthophosphate is HPO4^2-, but perhaps in this context, it refers to PO4^3-.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused about the terminology. Let me double-check.

Upon checking, orthophosphoric acid is H3PO4, and in solution, it exists as H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, and PO4^3-. Orthophosphate usually refers to the HPO4^2- ion, which is the fully deprotonated form except for the last hydrogen. So, PO4^3- is the fully deprotonated form, but it's called phosphate ion, while HPO4^2- is called hydrogen phosphate or orthophosphate.

So, perhaps the question is asking for HPO4^2-, but in that case, the concentration would be 0.028 M, which isn't an option.

But the calculation for PO4^3- gave me a value close to option A.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the total concentration of all phosphate species, but that would be much higher, so that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for [HPO4^2-], but I must have made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that when you mix these two salts, some of the H2PO4^- will dissociate into HPO4^2- and H+, and some of the HPO4^2- will dissociate into PO4^3- and H+.

So, the total concentration of HPO4^2- would be the initial amount plus the amount formed from H2PO4^-.

But this seems complicated, and perhaps it's beyond the scope of the problem.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to calculate the concentration of HPO4^2- using the buffer equation, considering the pH.

Wait, from the buffer equation, [HPO4^2-] = [H2PO4^-] * 10^(pH - pKa2).

But again, without knowing the pH, I can't proceed.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to find the concentration of HPO4^2- based on the ratio of the moles, assuming that the buffer equation holds, and then using that to find the concentration.

Wait, but I'm stuck again.

Let me try to think differently. Perhaps the solution is not a buffer because the two salts are in a certain ratio. Let's calculate the ratio of moles.

n(KH2PO4) = 0.007348 mol of H2PO4^-.

n(Na2HPO4) = 0.005610 mol of HPO4^2-.

The ratio is [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] = 0.005610 / 0.007348 ≈ 0.763.

So,

log(0.763) ≈ -0.117.

pH = pKa2 + (-0.117) ≈ 7.207 - 0.117 = 7.09.

So, [H+] = 1e-7.09 ≈ 8.21e-8 M.

Now, considering the dissociation of HPO4^2- into PO4^3-.

Ka3 = 1.8e-12 = [H+][PO4^3-]/[HPO4^2-].

So,

[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+].

[HPO4^2-] is 0.02805 M.

So,

[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02805) / 8.21e-8 ≈ (5.05e-14) / 8.21e-8 ≈ 6.15e-7 M.

Which matches option A (6.24e-7 M).

So, the answer would be option A.

But again, this depends on the question asking for PO4^3-, which is the fully deprotonated form.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for HPO4^2- and I'm making a mistake in the approach.

Wait, but in that case, the concentration would be ~0.028 M, which isn't an option. So perhaps the question is indeed about PO4^3-.

So, in conclusion, the concentration of PO4^3- is approximately 6.15e-7 M, which corresponds to option A: 6.24e-7 M.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions in the solution, we analyze the dissociation behavior of the given salts, KH₂PO₄ and Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O, in water. The problem involves the phosphate species H₃PO₄, H₂PO₄⁻, HPO₄²⁻, and PO₄³⁻, with the dissociation constants provided as:

- \( K_a1 = 7.5 \times 10^{-3} \)
- \( K_a2 = 6.2 \times 10^{-8} \)
- \( K_a3 = 1.8 \times 10^{-12} \)

### Step 1: Moles of Salts
The molar masses of the salts are:
- \( \text{KH}_2\text{PO}_4 = 136.09 \, \text{g/mol} \)
- \( \text{Na}_2\text{HPO}_4 \cdot 2\text{H}_2\text{O} = 177.99 \, \text{g/mol} \)

The moles of each salt are calculated as:
\[
\text{Moles of KH}_2\text{PO}_4 = \frac{1.00 \, \text{g}}{136.09 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.007348 \, \text{mol}
\]
\[
\text{Moles of Na}_2\text{HPO}_4 \cdot 2\text{H}_2\text{O} = \frac{1.00 \, \text{g}}{177.99 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.005610 \, \text{mol}
\]

### Step 2: Initial Concentrations
The solution volume is \( 200.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.200 \, \text{L} \). The initial concentrations of the ions are:
\[
[\text{H}_2\text{PO}_4^-] = \frac{0.007348 \, \text{mol}}{0.200 \, \text{L}} \approx 0.03674 \, \text{M}
\]
\[
[\text{HPO}_4^{2-}] = \frac{0.005610 \, \text{mol}}{0.200 \, \text{L}} \approx 0.02805 \, \text{M}
\]

### Step 3: Buffer Solution and Henderson-Hasselbalch Equation
The solution is a buffer for the second dissociation of phosphoric acid (\( \text{H}_2\text{PO}_4^- \leftrightarrow \text{H}^+ + \text{HPO}_4^{2-} \)), where:
\[
K_{a2} = 6.2 \times 10^{-8}, \quad pK_{a2} = \log(1/K_{a2}) \approx 7.21
\]
The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is:
\[
\text{pH} = pK_{a2} + \log\left(\frac{[\text{HPO}_4^{2-}]}{[\text{H}_2\text{PO}_4^-]}\right)
\]
Substituting the initial concentrations:
\[
\text{pH} = 7.21 + \log\left(\frac{0.02805}{0.03674}\right) \approx 7.21 + \log(0.763) \approx 7.21 - 0.117 \approx 7.09
\]
Thus, \([H^+] = 10^{-\text{pH}} \approx 10^{-7.09} \approx 8.21 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{M}\).

### Step 4: Dissociation of HPO₄²⁻ to PO₄³⁻
The third dissociation of phosphate (\( \text{HPO}_4^{2-} \leftrightarrow \text{H}^+ + \text{PO}_4^{3-} \)) is governed by:
\[
K_{a3} = 1.8 \times 10^{-12}
\]
The concentration of \( \text{PO}_4^{3-} \) is calculated using:
\[
K_{a3} = \frac{[H^+][\text{PO}_4^{3-}]}{[\text{HPO}_4^{2-}]}
\]
Rearranging:
\[
[\text{PO}_4^{3-}] = \frac{K_{a3} \cdot [\text{HPO}_4^{2-}]}{[H^+]}
\]
Substituting the values:
\[
[\text{PO}_4^{3-}] = \frac{(1.8 \times 10^{-12})(0.02805)}{8.21 \times 10^{-8}} \approx \frac{5.05 \times 10^{-14}}{8.21 \times 10^{-8}} \approx 6.15 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

### Step 5: Final Answer
The problem refers to "orthophosphate ions," which typically correspond to \( \text{PO}_4^{3-} \), the fully deprotonated form. The calculated concentration of \( \text{PO}_4^{3-} \) is approximately \( 6.15 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \), which is closest to option A (\( 6.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \)).
