Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Hmm, let's see. The question is about identifying the correct sequence of reagents to synthesize a specific compound from ethynylcyclohexane. The target molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. That's a mouthful. Let me break it down.

First, I'll try to visualize the structures. Ethynylcyclohexane is a cyclohexane ring with an ethynyl group attached. The ethynyl group is like a triple bond connected to another carbon, so it's CH2-C≡CH attached to the cyclohexane.

The target molecule has a cyclohexanecarbaldehyde group. So that's a cyclohexane ring with a carbonyl group (aldehyde) attached. Also, there's a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group attached to the carbonyl carbon. Wait, maybe I should draw this out.

Wait, the target molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So, the main chain is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, which is a cyclohexane ring with a -CHO group. Then, at position 1 (the same carbon as the aldehyde?), there's a substituent: cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl. Hmm, that might be a bit confusing. Let me think: the aldehyde is on the cyclohexane ring, and the substituent is a methyl group attached to that same carbon, which also has a hydroxyl group and a cyclohexyl group. Wait, no, maybe it's a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH(OH) group, which is attached to the main ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a methyl group where one of the substituents is a hydroxyl group and another is a cyclohexyl group. So, the structure would have the aldehyde on the cyclohexane, and the adjacent carbon (the same carbon as the aldehyde?) has a methyl group, which is connected to a hydroxyl group and a cyclohexyl group. Or wait, maybe the structure is a cyclohexane ring with a CHO group, and at the same position as the CHO, there's a CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group attached. I'm a bit confused about the exact structure, but perhaps the synthesis steps will clarify.

So, starting from ethynylcyclohexane. I need to figure out how to get to the target. Let's think about what reactions are typically used for such transformations.

First, ethynylcyclohexane is a sp-hybridized carbon attached to the cyclohexane. So, perhaps the first step is to deprotonate the triple bond. Using a strong base like NaNH2 (sodium amide) would deprotonate the ethynyl group, making it a good nucleophile.

Looking at the options, some of the first steps involve NaNH2. For instance, options A, B, C, and D all start with that except maybe not. Wait, option D starts with NaNH2 and methanol. So, the first reagent is NaNH2, which is a deprotonating agent. The second reagent in option B is ethyl chloride, and in option C, it's methyl chloride.

Wait, so if the first step is NaNH2, perhaps it's deprotonating the ethynyl group to form an acetylide. Then, in the next step, an alkylation occurs.

Wait, ethynylcyclohexane with NaNH2 would deprotonate to cyclohexylacetylide. Then, if we add an alkylating agent like methyl chloride, it would alkylate the acetylide, adding a methyl group. But wait, the acetylide is on the cyclohexane. Alternatively, maybe the methyl group is added elsewhere. Hmm.

Wait, if the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane (CH2-C≡CH attached to cyclohexane), then deprotonating would give a cyclohexylacetylide (Na+ [C≡C-]CH2-cyclohexane). Then, adding methyl chloride would provide a methyl group, giving something like CH2-C≡C-CH3 attached? Wait, that can't be right because the acetylide is a strong base and would attack the methyl chloride, adding a methyl to the acetylide carbon. So, the product would be (CH3)C≡C-CH2-cyclohexane? Wait, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethynyl group is in a different position. Let me think: ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane with the substituent CH2-C≡CH. So, the triple bond is between the two carbons, CH2- and C≡CH.

So, when NaNH2 is added, it deprotonates the terminal triple bond (C≡CH) to form an acetylide. The structure becomes CH2-C≡C^- Na^+.

Then, adding methyl chloride (CH3Cl) would alkylate the acetylide. The acetylide is a strong base and would attack the methyl chloride, giving CH2-C≡C-CH2- (with the Na+ maybe). Wait, but that's not right because the acetylide is at the end. Oh wait, the acetylide is CH2-C≡C^- , and adding methyl chloride (CH3Cl) would give CH2-C≡C-CH2Cl? No, because the acetylide is a strong base; methyl chloride would provide a methyl group via SN2. Wait, but the acetylide is a strong base, so maybe it's more about alkylation.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is that the acetylide (a strong base) would deprotonate methyl chloride, but wait, methyl chloride is a primary alkyl halide. So, the acetylide would attack the methyl chloride in an SN2 reaction, substituting the chloride with the acetylide's carbon. So, the product would be CH2-C≡C-CH2- ... Wait, but that would give a longer chain. Hmm, maybe that's not correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step is to form the acetylide, and then perform a coupling reaction, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the target molecule has a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group attached to a methyl group, which is attached to the cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So, maybe the synthesis involves adding a methyl group with some substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethynyl group is being converted into a carbonyl group. Wait, maybe after deprotonating and alkylating, the triple bond is hydrogenated. Let me look at the options.

Looking at option C: the steps are 1. NaNH2, methyl chloride; 2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate; 3. O3/(CH3)2S; 4. Ba(OH)2.

Wait, let me think through each step. First, NaNH2 and methyl chloride would alkylate the acetylide, as discussed. Then, H2 with Pd would hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond, turning the acetylene into an ethane. But wait, hydrogenating an acetylene with H2 and Pd would typically result in cis addition. Hmm, but wait, in this case, the acetylene is CH2-C≡C-CH3 after alkylation? Or maybe CH2-C≡C-CH2-... No, wait, the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane, which is CH2-C≡CH attached to cyclohexane. So, after alkylation with methyl chloride, the structure becomes CH2-C≡C-CH3?

Wait, no. Let me correct. The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane, which is cyclohexane with a CH2-C≡CH substituent. So, the structure is:

 cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH.

When NaNH2 is added, it deprotonates the terminal H on the triple bond (the C≡CH). So, the acetylide would be cyclohexane-CH2-C≡C^- Na^+.

Then, methyl chloride CH3Cl is a methylating agent. The acetylide would attack the methyl chloride, resulting in cyclohexane-CH2-C≡C-CH2Cl? Or wait, the acetylide is a strong base and would deprotonate methyl chloride? Hmm, methyl chloride is a primary alkyl halide. The acetylide (a strong base) would deprotonate it, but methyl chloride's hydrogen is not acidic. Alternatively, perhaps the acetylide attacks the methyl chloride in an SN2 mechanism, leading to cyclohexane-CH2-C≡C-CH3 (but that would be an alkyne? No, wait, the acetylide is CH2-C≡C^- – adding a methyl would give CH2-C≡C-CH3, but that's just a longer alkyne.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. So, after NaNH2 and methyl chloride, the ethynyl group is extended by a methyl group. So, the alkyne becomes longer. Then, the next step is hydrogenation with H2 and Pd. Hydrogenation of an alkyne with H2 and a catalyst (like Lindlar's) would give cis addition, but if it's just H2 and Pd, perhaps it's partial hydrogenation to the cis alkene, but wait, another possibility is that the alkyne is fully hydrogenated to an alkane.

Wait, the second step in option C is H2 with Pd-calcium carbonate. So, maybe it's a partial hydrogenation. Or perhaps, since the first step is alkyne alkylation, the second step is hydrogenation of the alkyne.

So, after alkylation, the triple bond is now between CH2 and a longer chain. Then, hydrogenation would add two hydrogens across the triple bond, converting it into a single bond. So, CH2-C≡C-CH3 would become CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, but wait, that doesn't make sense because hydrogenation of an alkyne would produce an alkene first, then a single bond if using excess hydrogen.

Wait, no. Alkynes can be hydrogenated to alkenes (cis or trans, depending on catalyst) or all the way to alkanes. If using H2 and Pd, which is a catalyst for full hydrogenation, the alkyne would become an alkane. So, after step 2, the alkyne becomes an ethane group.

So, the starting material was CH2-C≡CH (ethynylcyclohexane), after alkylation becomes CH2-C≡C-CH3, then after hydrogenation becomes CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3... Wait, but that's a single bond. Wait, the triple bond is CH2-C≡C-CH3, so hydrogenation would add two H's to each triple bond carbon, turning it into CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, that can't be right because the triple bond has two π bonds. Wait, when you hydrogenate a triple bond, you add two H's across each bond. So, for each π bond, you add one H. So, a triple bond (two π) would become a single bond after adding two H's to each carbon.

Wait, perhaps a better approach: The alkyne CH2-C≡CH would become CH2-CH2-CH3 after hydrogenation, but that seems like it's converting the triple bond into a single bond with two additional H's per carbon. So, CH2-C≡C-CH3 would become CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? Wait, that can't be right because that's four carbons in a row. Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is CH2-C≡C-CH2-R (if R is cyclohexane), so after hydrogenation, it becomes CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-R, but that doesn't make much sense.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think. The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane, which is cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH. Then, after alkylation (step 1), it's cyclohexane-CH2-C≡C-CH3. Then, step 2 is H2 and Pd, which would hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond, making it cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. But that's a four-carbon chain attached to cyclohexane. But the target seems to have a cyclohexyl group attached directly to a carbon that's also attached to hydroxyl and another cyclohexane.

Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this incorrectly. Let me think about the target molecule again. It’s 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So, the main structure is a cyclohexane ring with a carbaldehyde group (CHO), and at position 1 (same carbon?), a substituent which is a CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group.

Wait, maybe the structure is such that the aldehyde is on the cyclohexane, and the same carbon (the one with the aldehyde) has a CH group attached, which has an OH and a cyclohexyl group. So, the structure would be:

cyclohexane-CHO-CH(OH)(cyclohexyl)

But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde with a substituent on the same carbon as the aldehyde, which is a methyl group that's attached to a hydroxyl and a cyclohexyl group. So, it's cyclohexanecarbaldehyde with a CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group attached to the aldehyde carbon.

Wait, that would make it a geminal diol or something similar. Alternatively, maybe the structure is:

The cyclohexane ring has a CHO group attached. Then, the same carbon (as the aldehyde) has a CH2 group attached, which itself is connected to a hydroxyl group and a cyclohexyl group.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a CH(OH)CH2-cyclohexane group. No, perhaps I'm complicating it. Let me think about the steps again.

The target has a cyclohexyl group, a hydroxyl, and a methyl (or similar) group attached to the same carbon as the aldehyde. So, perhaps the synthesis involves adding a substituent to the aldehyde carbon, which requires prior formation of a ketone or aldehyde.

Wait, perhaps the process involves forming a ketone via some oxidation, then doing a substitution or addition.

Alternatively, maybe the ethynyl group is converted into a carbonyl group through oxidation. So, perhaps the steps involve deprotonating, alkylation, hydrogenation, and then oxidation.

Wait, let's go back to the options. Let me look at each option's steps.

Option A: Steps are NaNH2, methyl chloride; then H2/Pd; then Ba(OH)2; then H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O.

Wait, Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, perhaps for elimination. H2SO4 and HgSO4 are for oxidation, like in the oxidation of alcohols to ketones or aldehydes.

Option B: Steps are NaNH2, ethyl chloride; Li/liq. NH3; O3/H2O; NH4OH.

Li and liquid NH3 is for Birch reduction or for deprotonating to form a strong base, perhaps for elimination. O3 is for ozonolysis, which cleaves double bonds.

Option C: Steps are NaNH2, methyl chloride; H2/Pd-calcium carbonate; O3/(CH3)2S; Ba(OH)2.

So, after alkylation and hydrogenation, the alkyne is converted to an alkane, then ozonolysis would break the double bond, but wait, if the alkyne is hydrogenated to an alkane, there's no double bond for ozonolysis.

Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again.

Option D: Steps are NaNH2, methanol; Li/liq. NH3; O3/(CH3)2S; NH4OH.

Wait, NaNH2 and methanol would be a deprotonation and maybe an alkylation, but I'm not sure. Li and liquid NH3 is for reductions.

Wait, perhaps I should consider each option's steps in order.

Let me pick option C and think through each step.

Step 1: NaNH2 and methyl chloride.

As discussed, deprotonate ethynylcyclohexane to form acetylide. Then methyl chloride alkylates to form cyclohexane-CH2-C≡C-CH3.

Step 2: H2 with Pd-calcium carbonate. Hydrogenate the triple bond. So, the triple bond becomes a single bond, producing cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. Wait, but that's a four-carbon chain attached to the cyclohexane. So, the structure would be cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3.

But then step 3 is O3/(CH3)2S. Ozonolysis is used to cleave double bonds. But if after step 2, the triple bond is hydrogenated to a single bond, there's no double bond. So, ozonolysis wouldn't do anything. That doesn't make sense. So maybe option C is incorrect.

Option B: Steps are NaNH2, ethyl chloride; then Li/liq. NH3; O3/H2O; NH4OH.

So, step 1: ethynylcyclohexane treated with NaNH2 and ethyl chloride. This would form an ethylated acetylide. So, the triple bond becomes CH2-C≡C-CH2CH3?

Wait, ethyl chloride is CH3CH2Cl. The acetylide would attack, so the product would be CH2-C≡C-CH2CH2Cl? No, perhaps CH2-C≡C-CH2CH3? Because the acetylide is CH2-C≡C^- and ethyl chloride is CH2CH3Cl. So, perhaps the product is CH2-C≡C-CH2CH3. Then, step 2 is Li in liquid NH3. That's a strong base; perhaps it's for elimination or deprotonation. Then step 3 is O3/H2O, which would cleave a double bond. But so, after step 1, we have an ethyl-substituted acetylene. Then, step 2: Li and NH3 would deprotonate something. Maybe the product from step 1 is CH2-C≡C-CH2CH3. Then, Li in NH3 would abstract a proton, perhaps leading to an elimination reaction, forming a triple bond again, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the triple bond is hydrogenated in step 2, but I don't see any H2 in step 2 of option B. So perhaps step 2 is something else.

Hmm, maybe I'm getting stuck. Let's think about the target molecule and what functional groups are needed.

The target has a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH group that also has an OH and is attached to the aldehyde. So, perhaps the steps involve introducing a substituent via a Grignard or organometallic reaction.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the ethynylcyclohexane is first converted into a ketone or aldehyde. Then, some kind of addition happens to introduce the substituent.

Wait, maybe the process is: 

1. Ethynylcyclohexane → deprotonate to form acetylide.

2. Alkylation to add a methyl group, making a longer alkyne.

3. Hydrogenation of the alkyne to an alkane.

4. Oxidation of a secondary alcohol to a ketone, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think about oxidation steps. Looking at the options, some involve Ba(OH)2, which is a strong base, possibly for elimination or oxidation.

Option A: After alkylation and hydrogenation, step 3 is Ba(OH)2. Then step 4 is H2SO4 and HgSO4, which are for oxidizing alcohols to ketones or aldehydes.

Hmm, perhaps the steps are: 

- Ethynylcyclohexane is alkylated to form a longer alkyne.

- Then, the alkyne is hydrogenated to an alkane, perhaps forming a secondary alcohol.

- Then, treated with Ba(OH)2 (which is a strong base) to eliminate, forming an alkene.

- Finally, oxidation to an aldehyde.

Wait, but I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps the steps involve forming a diol, then oxidizing.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a carbonyl group via some oxidation.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to think of each option.

Option D: Steps are NaNH2 and methanol, then Li/liq NH3, O3, (CH3)2S, and NH4OH.

So, first step: NaNH2 and methanol. Methanol would act as an acid, but NaNH2 is a strong base. Maybe it's an alkylation with methyl group.

Wait, perhaps the first step is deprotonation of ethynyl group, forming an acetylide, which then reacts with methanol. But methanol is a poor electrophile; perhaps it's a quenching step. Alternatively, maybe the acetylide is quenched with methanol to form an ethyl group.

Wait, if the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane, which is CH2-C≡CH-cyclohexane, and after NaNH2, it's CH2-C≡C^- Na^+, then adding methanol (MeOH) would protonate it, giving CH2-C≡CH again. Not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps after deprotonation, the acetylide is treated with an alkyl halide, but in option D, the second reagent is Li and liquid NH3. Liquid NH3 is a solvent, and Li is a strong reducing agent. Li in NH3 is used for Birch reductions, which typically reduce aromatic rings, but maybe in this context, it's used for deprotonating something else.

Option D's step 3 is O3 and (CH3)2S. Ozonolysis followed by work-up with (CH3)2S (a reductive work-up) would cleave double bonds into aldehydes or ketones, depending on substituents.

But then, after that, step 4 is NH4OH, which is a mild reducing agent, perhaps for reducing ozonides or other functional groups.

Hmm, perhaps option D's steps are:

1. Deprotonate and maybe quench to form an alkane.

2. Li and NH3 for elimination or reduction.

3. Ozonolysis to form carbonyl groups.

4. Acidic work-up to hydrolyze any intermediates.

But I'm not entirely certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is to alkylate the acetylide, hydrogenate to form a diol, then oxidize to form the aldehyde.

Wait, another approach: The target molecule has a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group attached to a methyl group on the same carbon as the aldehyde. So, perhaps the synthesis involves:

1. Adding a methyl group to the acetylide.

2. Hydrogenating the alkyne to form a cis-alkene, then hydrobromic acid addition to form a diol.

3. Oxidation of the diol to form a carbonyl group.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is:

- Ethynylcyclohexane → deprotonate → alkylate to add a methyl group.

- Hydrogenate the alkyne to a cis-alkene.

- Then, perform an epoxidation, but I don't see that in any options.

Alternatively, perhaps after hydrogenation, oxidation occurs.

Wait, looking at option C again. Steps are:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride → alkylated acetylide.

2. H2/Pd → hydrogenate triple bond to single bond, making an alkane.

3. O3/(CH3)2S → cleave double bonds, but in this step, the molecule is an alkane, so ozonolysis wouldn't do anything. So option C's step 3 is problematic.

Option B: steps 1 and 2. Step 1: NaNH2 and ethyl chloride. So, ethyl chloride would alkylate the acetylide, making the alkyne longer. Then step 2: Li and NH3, which is a strong base. Maybe it's for elimination, forming a triple bond again, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps it's for deprotonating something else.

Then step 3: O3 and H2O. Ozonolysis would cleave the triple bond, but ozonolysis is usually for alkenes. Wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a diene, but I'm not following.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about the target molecule again. It needs a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH(OH) group, which is attached to the same carbon as the aldehyde.

So, perhaps the steps involve forming a ketone via oxidation, then doing a Grignard addition.

Wait, another angle: the target molecule has a cyclohexane ring with a -CHO group. To form the aldehyde, perhaps an oxidation step is involved.

So, from ethynylcyclohexane, perhaps we need to form a carbonyl group. So, the alkyne is oxidized.

Wait, but how to oxidize an alkyne to a carbonyl? One method is via hydration with HgSO4 and H2SO4. That turns the alkyne into a ketone or an aldehyde, depending on substitution.

Wait, but ethynylcyclohexane is CH2-C≡CH attached to cyclohexane. If we oxidize that triple bond, perhaps it would form a carbonyl.

Wait, let me think about that. Oxidizing an internal alkyne can give a diketone, but terminal alkynes can be oxidized to carboxylic acids. So, ethynylcyclohexane, which is a terminal alkyne, might be oxidized to cyclohexanecarboxylic acid. But the target is an aldehyde, not a carboxylic acid.

Hmm. Alternatively, partial oxidation or different conditions might give an aldehyde.

Another approach: Perhaps the alkyne is hydrogenated to a cis-alkene, then the alkene is epoxidized, but that doesn't fit into the options.

Wait, perhaps the steps involve:

1. Alkyne deprotonation and alkylation.

2. Hydrogenation to a cis-alkene.

3. Ozonolysis to break the double bond into carbonyl groups.

4. Work-up to form the aldehyde.

So, looking at option B: after alkylation (step 1), step 2 is Li and NH3. Maybe that's for elimination, forming the alkene. Then, step 3 is ozonolysis, which would cleave the alkene into two carbonyl groups. Then, step 4 is NH4OH, which is a mild acid for work-up.

Wait, but let's think through option B's steps:

1. Ethynylcyclohexane → deprotonate with NaNH2 → cyclohexylacetylide.

2. Alkylation with ethyl chloride → cyclohexyl-CH2-C≡C-CH2CH3.

3. H2/Pd? No, step 2 is Li and NH3. Li in NH3 is a strong base, perhaps for elimination. So, after alkylation, the molecule is CH2-C≡C-CH2CH3 attached to cyclohexane. Then, treating with Li and NH3 (Birch conditions?) would maybe deprotonate and eliminate, forming a triple bond again? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's for reducing a group.

Wait, this is getting too confusing. Maybe I should look for the correct order of reactions.

The target molecule has a cyclohexane ring with a CHO group and a CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group attached. So, perhaps the steps are:

1. Ethynylcyclohexane → deprotonate → acetylide.

2. Alkylation to add a methyl group → longer alkyne.

3. Hydrogenation of the alkyne → alkane with a substituent.

4. Oxidation to form an aldehyde.

Wait, but how? Let me think.

After alkylation, the structure is CH2-C≡C-CH3 attached to cyclohexane. Hydrogenate that triple bond to single bond (CH2-CH2-CH3), but that doesn't help.

Alternatively, perhaps after alkylation and hydrogenation, we have a secondary alcohol, which can be oxidized to a ketone, but the target is an aldehyde.

Hmm, perhaps another approach: The target has a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group on the same carbon as the aldehyde. So, perhaps a Grignard reaction is involved.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the alkyne is converted into a carbonyl group via oxidation, then a Grignard reagent adds to it, forming the cyclohexyl group.

Wait, but the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. So, if we oxidize the alkyne, perhaps we get a ketone. Then, a Grignard reaction could add a cyclohexyl group.

But I'm not seeing how that would directly form the target.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a diol via some dihydroxylation, then oxidized to form a carbonyl group.

Wait, but I don't see any dihydroxylation reagents in the options.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about each option's overall process.

Option C's steps:

1. Alkylation to add methyl.

2. Hydrogenate alkyne to single bond.

3. Ozonolysis: But after hydrogenation, there's no double bond, so ozonolysis can't do anything. So, option C is probably incorrect.

Option D's steps:

1. Deprotonate and quench with methanol, perhaps adding a methyl group.

2. Li and NH3: A strong base, perhaps for elimination.

3. Ozonolysis: If there's a double bond, it would be cleaved.

4. NH4OH: Work-up.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Alkylate the acetylide to add a methyl group.

2. Hydrogenate the alkyne to an alkene.

3. Ozonolysis to cleave the alkene into two carbonyl groups.

4. Acidic work-up to form aldehydes.

Wait, but the target is one aldehyde group. Maybe one of the ozonolysis products is a aldehyde, and the other is something else.

Wait, let's think. Suppose after alkylation, the structure is CH2-C≡C-CH2CH3 attached to cyclohexane. Then, hydrogenate the alkyne to cis-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, but that doesn't have a double bond. So, ozonolysis wouldn't work.

Alternatively, perhaps the hydrogenation is partial to form a cis-alkene. But that would require different catalysts.

Wait, perhaps in option B, step 2 is Li and NH3 for elimination, forming a double bond from an alkyne.

Wait, NaNH2 and ethyl chloride in step 1 would give a longer alkyne. Then, step 2: Li in NH3 is a strong base, perhaps causing elimination to form an alkene.

So, the alkyne CH2-C≡C-CH2CH3 would lose H2 to form CH2=CH-CH2CH3.

Wait, but I'm not sure about the mechanism. Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into an alkene via deprotonation and elimination.

Then, step 3 is ozonolysis, which would cleave the double bond into two carbonyl groups. For example, if the alkene is CH2=CH-CH2CH3, ozonolysis would cleave it into formaldehyde and another aldehyde, but in this case, the structure is more complex.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is to form a diene, then ozonolysis to form two carbonyl groups, which can then be worked up to form the desired aldehyde.

Alternatively, perhaps the key is to form a secondary alcohol which is then oxidized to a ketone, and then something else is added.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think of the possible steps again.

The target molecule has a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH(OH) group, which is attached to the same carbon as the aldehyde. So, perhaps the synthesis involves:

1. Adding a methyl group to the acetylide (alkylation).

2. Hydrogenating the alkyne to an alkene.

3. Performing an addition reaction (like hydroboration) to form an alcohol.

4. Oxidizing the alcohol to a carbonyl group (aldehyde).

But I'm not sure which option's steps match this.

Looking at option B: Steps are NaNH2, ethyl chloride; Li/NH3; O3/H2O; NH4OH.

So, step 1: alkylation to add ethyl group.

Step 2: Li/NH3. Maybe this step is for elimination, forming an alkene.

Step 3: O3/H2O. Ozonolysis of the alkene, which would cleave it into two carbonyl groups.

Step 4: NH4OH. Perhaps to work up the ozonolysis, which typically involves reductive work-up with something like Zn, but sometimes with H2O and acid.

Wait, if the alkene is cleaved into two carbonyls, perhaps one part becomes the aldehyde and the other becomes something else. But I'm not sure how that would lead to the target.

Alternatively, perhaps after ozonolysis, one of the carbonyls is a ketone and the other is an aldehyde, and then a subsequent step adds the cyclohexyl group.

Hmm, I'm not entirely certain. Another approach is to think about the possible oxidation steps.

Option A's steps include Ba(OH)2 and then H2SO4/HgSO4, which are used for oxidizing alcohols to ketones or aldehydes.

So, perhaps the process is:

1. Alkylate the acetylide.

2. Hydrogenate the alkyne to an alkane.

3. Ba(OH)2 for elimination or oxidation.

4. Oxidation to aldehyde.

But I'm not clear on how that would work.

Alternatively, perhaps step 3 in option A is Ba(OH)2, which is a strong base, causing elimination to form an alkene. Then, step 4 is oxidation of the alkene to a diol, but H2SO4 and HgSO4 are usually for oxidizing alcohols.

Wait, perhaps the steps are:

1. Ethynylcyclohexane → alkylation → longer alkyne.

2. H2/Pd → hydrogenate triple bond to single bond, making a secondary alcohol.

3. Ba(OH)2 → elimination to form an alkene.

4. H2SO4/HgSO4 → oxidize the alkene to a diol, but that doesn't seem to fit.

Alternatively, Ba(OH)2 could be a way to form a diol from an epoxide, but I don't think that's the case here.

Hmm, perhaps it's time to make an educated guess.

The target molecule has a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH(OH) group, which is on the same carbon as the aldehyde. So, perhaps the synthesis involves adding a substituent to the aldehyde carbon, which requires the aldehyde to be formed first.

Which option's steps would lead to the aldehyde group?

Looking at option C: after steps 3 and 4, Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, maybe for elimination, and then...?

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Alkylate the acetylide to add a methyl group.

2. Hydrogenate the alkyne to an alkane, perhaps creating a secondary alcohol.

3. Ozonolysis, but wait, that's only for double bonds.

Hmm, I'm not getting anywhere. Maybe I should look for the step that forms the aldehyde.

If the aldehyde is formed via oxidation, perhaps that comes from an alcohol. So, the steps would involve forming a secondary alcohol and then oxidizing it.

So, which option includes an oxidation step to aldehyde?

Option A: Steps 3 and 4: Ba(OH)2 and then H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, perhaps causing elimination, and the next step is an oxidation.

Option C: Steps include O3 and Ba(OH)2, which doesn't seem right.

Option D: Steps include O3 and NH4OH, which may not form an aldehyde.

So, considering option A: After alkylation and hydrogenation, the structure is a longer chain alkane. Then, Ba(OH)2 (step 3) perhaps to eliminate, forming a double bond or something else. Then, step 4 is H2SO4 and HgSO4, which are oxidizing agents. So, if the molecule has an alcohol group, this would oxidize it to a ketone or aldehyde.

Wait, perhaps the steps are:

1. Ethynylcyclohexane → alkylated acetylide → CH2-C≡C-CH3.

2. Hydrogenate the triple bond to single bond → CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 attached to cyclohexane.

3. Ba(OH)2: Maybe this is for elimination, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, Ba(OH)2 could be used in a Dieckmann cyclization, but that's for cyclic esters.

Alternatively, Ba(OH)2 could be used to eliminate a molecule of water, forming a double bond.

Wait, perhaps after step 2, the molecule is a secondary alcohol. Then, Ba(OH)2 might dehydrate it to form an alkene. Then, step 4 would oxidize the alkene to a diol, but that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, perhaps after step 3, we have an alkene, which is then oxidized in step 4 to form a carbonyl group.

But I'm not confident.

At this point, I think the correct answer is option C, but I'm not fully certain. Alternatively, option A could be correct.

Wait, another thought: The target molecule has a cyclohexyl group attached to the same carbon as the aldehyde. So, perhaps the steps involve adding a cyclohexyl group via alkylation, then forming the aldehyde.

But I'm not seeing that in any of the steps.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct order is to alkylate the acetylide, then hydrogenate to form a ketone, then do a Grignard addition.

But I'm getting stuck. I think I'll have to make a guess based on the steps.

Given that the target has an aldehyde group, one of the steps must involve oxidation. Option A has step 4 as H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O, which are for oxidation. So, perhaps the steps are:

1. Alkylation to add methyl group.

2. Hydrogenation to make a secondary alcohol.

3. Ba(OH)2 to eliminate to form an alkene.

4. Oxidation of the alkene to an aldehyde.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the aldehyde is formed directly from the alkyne via oxidation.

But without knowing the exact steps, it's challenging. I think I'll go with option C because after alkylation and hydrogenation, the molecule would have a longer chain, and ozonolysis would cleave any double bonds. But I'm not certain.

Wait, another angle: O3 is used to cleave double bonds into carbonyl groups. So, if after step 2, we have a double bond, then ozonolysis would break it into aldehydes or ketones.

Looking at option B: after step 2, Li and NH3 could form a double bond, then ozonolysis would cleave it.

So, step 1: Alkylation → longer alkyne.

Step 2: Li/NH3 → elimination to form a triple bond? Or perhaps form a double bond via deprotonation.

Wait, perhaps step 2 in option B converts the alkyne into an alkene. Then, step 3, ozonolysis would cleave the double bond into two carbonyls. Then, step 4 is a work-up with NH4OH, which is acidic, so it would hydrolyze any ozonides into aldehydes or ketones.

So, perhaps the target is formed by one of the ozonolysis products.

In that case, the correct reagent sequence would be option B.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves determining the correct sequence of reagents to synthesize 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde from ethynylcyclohexane. The target molecule has a cyclohexane ring with a carbaldehyde group (-CHO) and a substituent at the same carbon, which is a CH group attached to a hydroxyl group (-OH) and a cyclohexyl group. The analysis of the options is as follows:

### Key Analysis of Options:
1. **Option A**:  
   - Step 1: NaNH₂ and methyl chloride likely alkylate the acetylide of ethynylcyclohexane, forming a longer alkyne.  
   - Step 2: H₂/Pd likely hydrogenates the alkyne to an alkane.  
   - Step 3: Ba(OH)₂ is a strong base, possibly for elimination or oxidation.  
   - Step 4: H₂SO₄ and HgSO₄ are oxidizing agents, typically used to oxidize alcohols to aldehydes or ketones.  
   - However, the sequence does not clearly explain how the hydroxyl and cyclohexyl groups are introduced, making this option less likely.

2. **Option B**:  
   - Step 1: NaNH₂ and ethyl chloride alkylate the acetylide, forming a longer alkyne.  
   - Step 2: Li/liq. NH₃ is a strong base, possibly used for elimination to form a double bond or further deprotonate.  
   - Step 3: O₃/H₂O performs ozonolysis, which cleaves double bonds into carbonyl groups.  
   - Step 4: NH₄OH is a mild reducing agent, likely used for work-up after ozonolysis.  
   - This sequence aligns well with the formation of the aldehyde group and the introduction of substituents, making it a strong candidate.

3. **Option C**:  
   - Step 1: NaNH₂ and methyl chloride alkylate the acetylide, forming a longer alkyne.  
   - Step 2: H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate hydrogenates the alkyne to a single bond, likely forming a saturated compound.  
   - Step 3: O₃/(CH₃)₂S is used for ozonolysis, but since the alkyne has already been hydrogenated to a single bond, there is no double bond to cleave, rendering this step ineffective.  
   - This makes the sequence incomplete and unlikely.

4. **Option D**:  
   - Step 1: NaNH₂ and methanol likely quench the acetylide, forming a saturated compound.  
   - Step 2: Li/liq. NH₃ is a strong base, possibly used for elimination.  
   - Step 3: O₃/(CH₃)₂S performs ozonolysis, but the sequence does not clearly explain how the aldehyde group or substituents are introduced.  
   - This option is less likely due to the lack of clarity in forming the target structure.

### Conclusion:
Option B provides the most plausible sequence of reagents. The alkylation step introduces a longer chain, the elimination step forms a double bond, ozonolysis cleaves it into carbonyl groups, and the final work-up with NH₄OH likely forms the aldehyde and introduces the necessary substituents. This sequence aligns well with the target molecule's structure.
