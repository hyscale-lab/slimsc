Okay, so I have this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm. Let me think through this step by step.

The question says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. The energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. And we're assuming Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), which I remember means that the gas is in thermal equilibrium, so the usual Boltzmann distribution applies.

So, in LTE, the population of energy levels depends on temperature. The Boltzmann equation comes into play here. The equation is n_i / n_j = (g_i / g_j) * exp( - (E_i - E_j) / (k T) ), where n_i and n_j are the number of particles in states i and j, g_i and g_j are the statistical weights, E is energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is temperature.

In the problem, the energy difference is given as ΔE = 1.38e-23 J. Let's note that. Also, since the question says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific level. I think this means that the ratio of the number of atoms in the excited state to some other state is different between the two stars.

Wait, but the problem states that in star_1, the atoms are twice as excited. So maybe the ratio of the excited state to the ground state (or another lower state) is twice as much in star_1 compared to star_2.

Let me denote the ratio for star_1 as R1 and for star_2 as R2. So, R1 = 2 * R2.

According to the Boltzmann equation, R = (g_i / g_j) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) ). Assuming that the statistical weights g_i and g_j are the same for both stars (since it's the same element and same transition), the ratio simplifies to just the exponential term.

So R1 = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )
R2 = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

But wait, the question says star_1's atoms are twice as excited as star_2's. So maybe R1 is 2 times higher than R2. So R1 = 2 R2.

Wait, but excitation being higher could mean that the population in the excited state is higher. So if the ratio of excited to ground is higher, that would mean more excitation. So let's think about it.

Another way to phrase it: the excitation is twice as excited. So perhaps n_i / n_j for star_1 is twice that for star_2.

So, R1 = 2 R2.

Substituting the Boltzmann expressions:

exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Wait, but wait, let me make sure. The ratio for star_1 is R1 = n1_i / n1_j = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) * (g_i/g_j). Similarly for star_2. But if the g's are the same, then R is proportional to exp(-ΔE/(k T)).

So, R1 = exp(-ΔE/(k T1)), R2 = exp(-ΔE/(k T2)).

Given that R1 = 2 R2 → exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) = 2 * exp(-ΔE/(k T2))

Hmm, that's the equation. Let me write that:

exp[ -ΔE/(k T1) ] = 2 exp[ -ΔE/(k T2) ]

I can take the natural log of both sides to simplify.

So,

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) + [ -ΔE/(k T2) ]

Multiply both sides by -k:

ΔE/(k T1) = -ln(2) + ΔE/(k T2)

Wait, let me rearrange:

ΔE/(k T1) - ΔE/(k T2) = ln(2) * (-1)

Wait, wait, let me double-check the algebra.

Wait, the equation after taking logs is:

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) - ΔE/(k T2)

Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me do it step by step.

Start with:

exp(a) = 2 exp(b), where a = -ΔE/(k T1), b = -ΔE/(k T2).

Take ln of both sides:

a = ln(2) + b

Which is:

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) - ΔE/(k T2)

Now, let's bring the terms involving T1 and T2 to one side.

-ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) = ln(2)

Factor out ΔE/(k):

ΔE/(k) [ 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ] = ln(2)

Wait, because 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) comes from [ -1/(T1) + 1/(T2) ) ].

So,

ΔE/(k) [ (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ) ] = ln(2)

Wait, let me compute 1/T2 - 1/T1: that's (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2), right?

Yes, because (1/T2 - 1/T1) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).

So, the equation becomes:

(ΔE/(k)) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

Hmm. So, rearranged:

ln(2) = (ΔE/(k)) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see an equation that has T1 minus T2. Let me check the options.

Options:

Option D says ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

Wait, but in our equation, we have a factor of ΔE/(k) multiplied by that term.

But in the given problem, ΔE is 1.38e-23 J. So perhaps ΔE/(k) is a known value.

Wait, Boltzmann's constant k is approximately 1.38e-23 J/K. Oh wait, that's exactly the value given for ΔE here. So ΔE is given as 1.38e-23 J. So, ΔE = k.

So, ΔE/(k) = 1.

Ah, that's a key point. Because ΔE = 1.38e-23 J, which is exactly k's value (since k ≈ 1.38e-23 J/K).

So, substituting that into the equation, ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

So, looking at the options, option D is ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).

So the correct equation is option D.

The problem involves determining the relationship between the effective temperatures of two stars (T₁ and T₂) based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. The key information provided is that the excitation of iron atoms in star_1 is twice as high as in star_2, and the energy difference between the relevant energy levels is ΔE = 1.38 × 10⁻²³ J. Assuming Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the Boltzmann distribution applies, which relates the population of energy levels to temperature.

The Boltzmann equation is given as:

\[
\frac{n_i}{n_j} = \frac{g_i}{g_j} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right),
\]

where \(n_i\) and \(n_j\) are the populations of the excited and ground states, \(g_i\) and \(g_j\) are the statistical weights, \(\Delta E\) is the energy difference, \(k\) is Boltzmann's constant, and \(T\) is the temperature. Since the statistical weights \(g_i\) and \(g_j\) are assumed to be the same for both stars, the ratio of excitation simplifies to:

\[
\frac{n_i}{n_j} \propto \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right).
\]

For star_1 and star_2, the excitation ratios are:

\[
R_1 = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right), \quad R_2 = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right).
\]

The problem states that \(R_1 = 2 R_2\), leading to:

\[
\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right) = 2 \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right).
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1} = \ln(2) - \frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}.
\]

Rearranging terms:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right) = \ln(2).
\]

Factoring the terms involving \(T_1\) and \(T_2\):

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \cdot \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} = \ln(2).
\]

Since \(\Delta E = k\) (given as \(1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}\), which matches the value of \(k\)), the equation simplifies to:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

This matches option D. Therefore, the correct equation for the effective temperatures of the stars is:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

Answer: D
