Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to work through it. The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. 

Hmm, wait, the operator P is given with its X, Y, and Z components. Oh right, in quantum mechanics, operators like spin can be represented as vectors. So the operator P is probably the spin operator for a muon, which is like a particle with spin 1/2. So the components P_x, P_y, P_z are each 2x2 matrices multiplied by ħ/2.

The problem is asking for the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. Since it's an eigenvalue problem, I remember that the eigenvector equation is P |v> = λ |v>, where λ is the eigenvalue. But wait, actually, it's for the operator along direction n. So the operator we're considering here is the component of P along n, which would be P·n? Or maybe the operator is (P·n), which is a combination of P_x, P_y, P_z multiplied by their respective direction cosines. Because the direction n is arbitrary but lies in the x-z plane, so n has components (nx, 0, nz), right? Because it's in the x-z plane, the y-component is zero.

So the operator along n would be P·n = nx P_x + nz P_z. Because the y-component of n is zero, the Py term drops out.

Wait, but the problem says the operator is P along direction n. So the operator we're looking at is the component of P in the direction of n. That makes sense because then the eigenvalue +ħ/2 is the maximum eigenvalue. For spin-1/2 systems, the eigenvalues are ± ħ/2 for the spin component along any direction.

So the first step is to construct the matrix for the operator P·n. Let me think. The operator P·n is nx P_x + nz P_z. Let me write down the matrices for P_x, P_y, P_z.

Given:
P_x = ħ/2 * [[0, 1],
             [1, 0]]
P_y = ħ/2 * [[0, -i],
             [i, 0]]
P_z = ħ/2 * [[1, 0],
             [0, -1]]

So, P·n = (nx) P_x + (nz) P_z. Let me compute that matrix.

Matrix-wise, that would be:

nx * P_x matrix: [[0, nx], [nx, 0]] multiplied by ħ/2.

nz * P_z matrix: [[nz, 0], [0, -nz]] multiplied by ħ/2.

Adding these together:

(ħ/2) * [ [nz, nx], [nx, -nz] ]

So the matrix of the operator P·n is (ħ/2) times [[nz, nx], [nx, -nz]].

Now, the eigenvalues of this matrix should be ±ħ/2. Because for spin-1/2 systems, the spin component along any direction has eigenvalues ± ħ/2.

We're interested in the eigenvalue +ħ/2. So the eigenvector equation is:

(P·n) |v> = (ħ/2) |v>

Wait, no. Let me correct that. The eigenvalue equation is (P·n) |v> = λ |v>, where λ is the eigenvalue. So for λ = ħ/2, we have:

(P·n) |v> = (ħ/2) |v>

So let's substitute our (P·n) matrix:

(ħ/2) * [ [nz, nx], [nx, -nz] ] * |v> = (ħ/2) |v>

Multiply both sides by 2/ħ to simplify:

[ [nz, nx], [nx, -nz] ] |v> = |v>

So the matrix equation is:

[nz a + nx b, nx a - nz b] = [a, b]

Wait, wait, let me set up the equations properly. Let |v> be a column vector [a; b]. Then the equation becomes:

nz a + nx b = a
nx a - nz b = b

Wait, let me check that. The matrix multiplication:

First component: nz * a + nx * b = a
Second component: nx * a + (-nz) * b = b

So the two equations are:

nz a + nx b = a  --> (nz - 1) a + nx b = 0
nx a - nz b = b  --> nx a + (-nz -1) b = 0

We can write these as:

(nz - 1) a + nx b = 0
nx a + (-nz -1) b =0

Hmm, this might lead to a system of equations. Let's write the first equation as:

a (nz -1) + b nx =0. --> (nz -1) a = -nx b --> a = [ -nx / (nz -1) ] b 

But wait, perhaps it's better to subtract the equations or find a ratio between a and b.

Alternatively, since the system is homogeneous, we can set the determinant to zero for non-trivial solutions. But wait, the eigenvalue approach is perhaps more straightforward.

Wait, maybe it's easier to find the eigenvectors by considering the ratio of the equations.

From the first equation:

(nz -1) a + nx b = 0 --> (nz -1) a = -nx b --> a = [ -nx / (nz -1) ] b

Let me substitute a into the second equation:

nx a + (-nz -1) b =0

Substituting a:

nx [ (-nx)/(nz-1) b ] + (-nz -1) b =0

Multiply through:

[ (-nx^2)/(nz -1) ) * b ] + [ (-nz -1) b ] =0

Factor out b:

b [ (-nx^2)/(nz -1) - (nz +1) ] = 0

Since the eigenvector is non-zero, b can't be zero. So the expression in the brackets must be zero.

So:

(-nx^2)/(nz -1) ) - (nz +1) =0

Let's multiply both sides by (nz -1) to eliminate the denominator:

- nx^2 - (nz +1)(nz -1) )=0

Expand the second term: (nz +1)(nz -1) = nz^2 -1.

So:

- nx^2 - (nz² -1) )=0
=> -nx² -nz² +1 =0
=> nx² + nz² =1

But since n is a unit vector in the x-z plane, n has components (nx, 0, nz), so indeed nx² + nz² =1. So the equation holds. Therefore, the two equations are dependent, and we can proceed.

So, from the first equation, a = [ -nx / (nz -1) ] b.

Let me write a in terms of b. Let me denote this as a = k b, where k is the proportionality constant.

So, a = [ (-nx) / (nz -1) ] b.

So the eigenvector is proportional to [a, b] = [ (-nx)/(nz-1) * b, b ].

We can factor out b, so the eigenvector is proportional to [ (-nx)/(nz-1), 1 ]

But perhaps it's better to express this in terms of an angle. Since n is in the x-z plane, we can parametrize it as n = (cosθ, 0, sinθ), where θ is the angle from the z-axis. So nx = cosθ, nz = sinθ.

Substituting these into the expression for a.

So a = [ -cosθ / (sinθ -1) ] * b.

Hmm, that seems a bit messy. Let me try to find the ratio a/b.

Let me denote r = a/b = [ -cosθ / (sinθ -1) ]

Wait, perhaps we can simplify this ratio.

Multiply numerator and denominator by (sinθ +1):

r = [ -cosθ (sinθ +1) ] / [ (sinθ -1)(sinθ +1) ) ]

Denominator becomes sin²θ -1 = -cos²θ.

So,

r = [ -cosθ (sinθ +1) ] / (- cos²θ) )

The negatives cancel, so:

r = [ cosθ (sinθ +1) ] / cos²θ = [ (sinθ +1) ] / cosθ

Wait, wait, let me recheck:

Wait, denominator is (sinθ -1)(sinθ +1) = sin^2θ - 1 = -(1 - sin^2θ) = -cos²θ.

So,

r = [ -cosθ (sinθ +1) ] / ( - cos²θ )

The negatives cancel: numerator and denominator both negative, so positive.

So,

r = [ cosθ (sinθ +1) ] / cos²θ = (sinθ + 1) / cosθ.

So,

a/b = (sinθ +1)/cosθ.

So the ratio is (sinθ + 1)/cosθ.

Hmm, that's a bit complicated. Let me see if I can rewrite this in terms of trigonometric identities.

Wait, perhaps we can write (sinθ +1) as 1 + sinθ, and then perhaps use a substitution.

Alternatively, perhaps we can parameterize the eigenvector in terms of angles. Let me think: spin-up along direction n would have components depending on θ and phi, but since n is in the x-z plane, phi is zero, so the state is a combination of |+z> and |−z> states.

Wait, perhaps another approach: For a spin-1/2 particle, the eigenstate along direction n = (nx, 0, nz) is given by a spin coherent state, which can be written as |+n> = cos(θ/2)|↑⟩ + e^{iφ} sin(θ/2)|↓⟩. But since φ is zero here (n lies in x-z plane, so no y-component), the state becomes cos(θ/2)|↑> + sin(θ/2)|↓>, perhaps with a phase factor. But wait, I'm not entirely certain about the signs.

Wait, another way: the eigenvectors for spin in direction n can be written as:

|+n> = [ cos(θ/2), e^{iφ} sin(θ/2) ]^T

But since the direction is in x-z, φ=0, so it's [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ]^T.

Wait, but let me think about the components. If n is along the z-axis (θ=0), the eigenvector is [1,0], which is correct. If n is along x (θ=90 degrees), then cos(θ/2) is cos(45) = √2/2, and sin(θ/2)= √2/2. So the state would be [√2/2, √2/2], which makes sense as the eigenstate of S_x.

Wait, but wait. When n is along x, the operator S_x has eigenvalues ± ħ/2. The eigenvectors are |+x> = (|↑> + |↓>)/√2, which matches [√2/2, √2/2], which is the same as [cos(45°), sin(45°)].

So yes, the general form is [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ] for the + eigenvalue.

Wait, but according to our earlier calculation, the ratio a/b is (sinθ +1)/cosθ. Let me see if this matches.

Wait, let's compute a/b in terms of this parameterization.

If a = cos(θ/2), b= sin(θ/2), then a/b = cot(θ/2).

But according to our earlier calculation, a/b = (sinθ +1)/cosθ.

Wait, let me compute (sinθ +1)/cosθ.

We can write sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2), and cosθ = cos^2(θ/2) - sin^2(θ/2) = 1 - 2 sin^2(θ/2) = 2 cos^2(θ/2) -1.

So, (sinθ +1)/cosθ = [2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2) + 1 ] / [cos^2(θ/2) - sin^2(θ/2)].

But perhaps it's easier to express (sinθ +1) as 2 sin^2(theta/2 + pi/4) or something, but maybe another approach is better.

Wait, let me compute a/b from the parameterization a=cos(theta/2), b=sin(theta/2):

a/b = cot(theta/2) = (cos(theta/2))/(sin(theta/2)).

On the other hand, our equation gives a/b=(sin theta +1)/cos theta.

So, equate these two expressions:

cot(theta/2) = (sin theta +1)/cos theta.

Let me check if this is true.

We can express (sin theta +1)/cos theta:

= (2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) + 1) ) / [ cos^2(theta/2) - sin^2(theta/2) ]

Hmm, maybe we can write this as [ 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) + 1 ] / [ (cos theta/2)^2 - (sin theta/2)^2 ) ]

Wait, but cot(theta/2) is [cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2)].

Not sure if that helps, but perhaps we can compute (sin theta +1)/cos theta.

Let me compute:

sin theta +1 = 2 sin(theta/2 + pi/4)^2 ? Not sure. Alternatively, use substitution.

Let me consider theta as an angle. Let me set t = theta/2.

So theta = 2t.

Then, (sin(2t) +1)/cos(2t) = [ 2 sin t cos t +1 ] / (cos^2 t - sin^2 t )

Hmm, the numerator is 2 sin t cos t +1. The denominator is cos(2t).

Alternatively, let's compute (sin 2t +1)/cos 2t.

= (2 sin t cos t + 1) / (cos^2 t - sin^2 t )

Let me factor the numerator and denominator.

The numerator can be written as 1 + 2 sin t cos t = (sin t + cos t)^2.

Because (sin t + cos t)^2 = sin^2 t + 2 sin t cos t + cos^2 t = 1 + 2 sin t cos t.

So numerator is (sin t + cos t)^2.

Denominator: cos^2 t - sin^2 t = (cos t - sin t)(cos t + sin t).

So,

(sin 2t +1)/cos 2t = [ (sin t + cos t)^2 ] / [ (cos t - sin t)(cos t + sin t) ) ]

The (sin t + cos t) terms cancel, leaving (sin t + cos t)/(cos t - sin t).

Which can be written as:

[ (sin t + cos t) ] / [ (cos t - sin t) ) ] = [ (1 + tan t) ] / [ (1 - tan t) ) ].

Hmm, let me compute this expression.

[ (1 + tan t) ] / [1 - tan t ].

Which is equal to [ (cos t + sin t ) ] / [ (cos t - sin t ) ) ].

Wait, but this doesn't seem to directly give cot t.

Alternatively, perhaps we can write it as [ (1 + tan t) ] / [ (1 - tan t) ) ] = [ (1 + tan t) ]^2 / (1 - tan^2 t) ) but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should proceed differently. Let me see whether (sin theta + 1)/cos theta equals cot(theta/2).

Compute cot(theta/2) = cos(theta/2) / sin(theta/2) = [1 - 2 sin^2(theta/4)] / [2 sin(theta/4) cos(theta/4)].

Wait, perhaps not the best approach. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to pick a specific angle and check.

Let me take theta = 90 degrees (pi/2 radians). Then, what is (sin theta +1)/cos theta?

sin 90 = 1, cos 90 = 0. So (1 +1)/0 --> undefined. Hmm, that's a problem. But for theta = 90, the eigenvector should be [0,1] or [1,0], but wait, wait.

Wait, theta is the angle from the z-axis. So when theta is 90 degrees, the direction is along x. The eigenstate should be [1, 1]/√2, but that's not matching with our previous ratio.

Wait, in this case, a/b would be (1 +1)/0, which is undefined, implying a is infinite, which doesn't make sense. Hmm, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the ratio earlier.

Wait, perhaps I should re-express the equations. Let's go back to the equations:

nz a + nx b = a

Which can be written as (nz -1) a + nx b = 0.

nx a - (nz +1) b =0.

Wait, because the second equation is nx a - nz b = b → nx a = (nz +1) b → nx a = (nz +1) b.

So, nx a = (nz +1) b.

So, from the second equation, a = [ (nz +1)/nx ] b.

Wait, but then from the first equation: (nz -1) a + nx b =0.

Substitute a = [ (nz +1)/nx ] b into this:

(nz -1) [ (nz +1)/nx ) b ] + nx b = 0.

Factor out b:

b [ (nz -1)(nz +1)/nx + nx ] =0.

Since b is not zero, the term in brackets must be zero.

Compute (nz^2 -1)/nx + nx =0.

Multiply through by nx:

nz^2 -1 + nx^2 =0.

But since nx^2 + nz^2 =1, we have (1 - nz^2) + nz^2 -1 =0? Wait, no, wait: nx^2 + nz^2 =1.

So nx^2 + nz^2 =1. So nx^2 =1 - nz^2.

Wait, but the equation becomes:

(nz^2 -1) + nx^2 = 0.

Substituting nx^2 =1 - nz^2:

nz^2 -1 + (1 - nz^2) =0 → 0=0.

So, yes, the equation holds. That means our substitution for a is correct.

So, a = [ (nz +1)/nx ] b.

So the ratio a/b is (nz + 1)/nx.

Substituting nx = cos theta and nz = sin theta, since n is (cos theta, 0, sin theta), this ratio becomes (sin theta +1)/cos theta.

Which brings us back to the same point.

Wait, but when theta is 90 degrees, this ratio is (1+1)/0, which is undefined, which suggests a is infinite, which can't be. So perhaps there's a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of eigenvectors for the spin component along an arbitrary axis. The general form for a spin-1/2 particle's eigenstate along direction (nx, ny, nz) is given by:

|+n> = e^{-i phi/2} [ cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) ]^T,

where theta is the polar angle and phi the azimuthal angle. But since our n is in the x-z plane, phi is 0, so the state becomes [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]^T.

Wait, but that's the same as the parameterization I thought of earlier. So the eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]^T.

But when theta is 90 degrees, this would be [0, 1], which is an eigenvector of S_x with eigenvalue +ħ/2. Because S_x |+x> = ħ/2 |+x>, and |+x> is (|↑> + |↓>)/√2, wait no, when theta is 90 degrees, that's along x, so the state should be (|↑> + |↓>)/√2. But according to [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)] with theta=90, cos(45)=√2/2 and sin(45)=√2/2, so [√2/2, √2/2], which is the correct |+x> state.

Wait, but earlier when theta=90 degrees, according to our ratio a/b = (1 +1)/0, which is undefined. So perhaps my earlier approach missed something, but the parameterization from the general spin state gives the correct result.

So, perhaps the eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]^T.

Now, looking at the options:

Option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which matches this.

Option B is (cos theta, e^{i phi} sin theta), which doesn't have the theta/2 argument.

Option D has sqrt(2/3) and sqrt(1/3) factors multiplied by cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2), but I don't think those factors are present because the eigenvectors are normalized, so sqrt( [cos(theta/2)]^2 + [sin(theta/2)]^2 ) is 1, so the option D's (sqrt(2/3), sqrt(1/3)) factors suggest a different normalization.

Wait, but wait: Are the eigenvectors unit vectors? Yes, they should be normalized. The state [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ] is already normalized because cos^2 + sin^2 =1.

So, looking at the options, the correct normalized eigenvector would have components (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), as in option C.

But let me look at the options again.

Option C says (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Option D has sqrt(2/3) and sqrt(1/3) multiplied by cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2) respectively.

Wait, but why would there be sqrt(2/3) and sqrt(1/3) factors? That would imply a different normalization or perhaps a different state. Unless the components are scaled by some factors, but I don't think that's the case for eigenvectors.

Hmm, but perhaps I should re-express the eigenvector in terms of another parameterization.

Wait, another approach: since the operator is P·n = nx P_x + nz P_z, and the eigenvalue is +ħ/2, the eigenvector can be found using the standard spin-1/2 approach. The eigenstate |+n> can be written as:

|+n> = cos(theta/2) |↑> + e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) |↓>

But since phi=0, as n is in the x-z plane, it becomes:

|+n> = cos(theta/2) |↑> + sin(theta/2) |↓>

Which matches option C.

So, the eigenvectors are (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Looking back at the options, option C is exactly this. So the answer would be C.

Wait, but wait: the problem statement says to find the eigenvector of the operator P along n. So the eigenvector is a spin up state along n, which is given by option C.

So the correct answer is option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we need to find the normalized eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator $\vec{P}$ along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The operator $\vec{P}$ has components $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$, which are given as $2 \times 2$ matrices multiplied by $\hbar/2$. The direction $\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane, so it can be parametrized as $\vec{n} = (\cos\theta, 0, \sin\theta)$, where $\theta$ is the polar angle from the z-axis.

### Key Steps:
1. **Operator along $\vec{n}$**: The operator $\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n}$ is constructed as a linear combination of $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$:
   \[
   \vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = n_x P_x + n_z P_z,
   \]
   where $n_x = \cos\theta$ and $n_z = \sin\theta$. Substituting the given matrices for $P_x$ and $P_z$, the matrix representation of $\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n}$ becomes:
   \[
   \vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} n_z & n_x \\ n_x & -n_z \end{bmatrix}.
   \]

2. **Eigenvalue Equation**: The eigenvalue equation is:
   \[
   (\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n}) |v\rangle = \lambda |v\rangle,
   \]
   where $\lambda = +\hbar/2$ is the eigenvalue. Substituting the matrix for $\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n}$ and simplifying, the eigenvector $|v\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix}$ satisfies:
   \[
   \begin{cases}
   (n_z - 1)a + n_x b = 0, \\
   n_x a - (n_z + 1)b = 0.
   \end{cases}
   \]

3. **Solving for the Eigenvector**: From the equations, the ratio $a/b$ is found to be:
   \[
   \frac{a}{b} = \frac{n_z + 1}{n_x}.
   \]
   Substituting $n_x = \cos\theta$ and $n_z = \sin\theta$, this ratio becomes:
   \[
   \frac{a}{b} = \frac{\sin\theta + 1}{\cos\theta}.
   \]

4. **Parameterization of the Eigenvector**: For a spin-1/2 particle, the eigenstate along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ is generally given by:
   \[
   |+n\rangle = \cos(\theta/2) | \uparrow \rangle + \sin(\theta/2) | \downarrow \rangle,
   \]
   which corresponds to the normalized eigenvector:
   \[
   |v\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} \cos(\theta/2) \\ \sin(\theta/2) \end{bmatrix}.
   \]

5. **Verification**: The eigenvector is normalized, as $\cos^2(\theta/2) + \sin^2(\theta/2) = 1$. This matches the expected form of the eigenstate for spin-1/2 systems.

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A**: $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar, \sqrt{1/3}\hbar)$: This does not match the derived eigenvector form and introduces unnecessary scaling factors.
- **Option B**: $(\cos\theta, e^{i\phi}\sin\theta)$: This form does not include the $\theta/2$ dependence, which is critical for the correct parameterization of the eigenvector.
- **Option C**: $(\cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2))$: This matches the derived eigenvector form exactly and is normalized.
- **Option D**: $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar \cos(\theta/2), \sqrt{1/3}\hbar \sin(\theta/2))$: This introduces incorrect scaling factors and is inconsistent with the normalization condition.

### Conclusion:
The correct normalized eigenvector is given by **Option C**: $(\cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2))$.

Answer: C
