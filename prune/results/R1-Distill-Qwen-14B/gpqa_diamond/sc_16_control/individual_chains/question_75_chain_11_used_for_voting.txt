Okay, so I've got this question about molecular biology techniques and transgenic mice. Hmm, let me try to break it down.

The scenario is that someone is trying to create a transgenic mouse model where GADD45G is overexpressed. They're using a construct that includes the coding sequence for GADD45G, but they added an influenza hemagglutinin (HA) tag at the N-terminus. They transfected Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells with this plasmid using Lipofectamine and are selecting for antibiotic resistance. However, when they check the expression, the protein isn't overexpressed as expected. They looked at the sequence of the plus strand of their construct and found an issue.

The question is asking why the overexpression isn't happening. The options are A to D.

Let me think about how the construct would be made. They introduced the HA tag at the N-terminus. HA is a small peptide tag, so it's usually added via a linker or just directly. When they made the construct, they might have inserted it into the vector in a way that affects expression.

Looking at the given DNA sequence, let's see if there's any obvious issue. The sequence starts with 5' ATG... which is the start codon, methionine. Then, the next few codons would be TAC (tyrosine), then CC... wait, let me parse it.

Wait, the HA tag's coding sequence. HA is a glycoprotein from influenza, right? The HA tag is usually a specific peptide, like YPYDVPDYA. Its coding sequence would be something like TAC GAT GGT TAC GAT GGT ... wait, but I might not remember the exact sequence.

Wait, perhaps the problem is in the reading frame. The HA tag is added as a fusion. So the construct's sequence starts with ATG, then the HA tag, then the GADD45G coding sequence. But if there's a frame shift, that would mess up the reading frame.

Wait, looking at the sequence given. Let me see the first few codons. ATG TAC CCC ATA CGA TGT TCC AGA TTA CGC CAA ATG ACT CTG GAA GAA TCC GCG GCC AGG ACA CAG TTT CC... Hmm.

Wait, ATG is the start codon (methionine). Next is TAC (tyrosine), then CCC (proline), then ATA (isoleucine), then CGA (arginine), TGT (cysteine), TCC (serine), AGA (arginine), TTA (leucine), CGC (arginine), CAA (glutamine), ATG (another start codon?), ACT (threonine), CTG (leucine), GAA (glutamic acid), GAA (again), TCC (serine), GCG (alanine), etc.

Wait, but the HA tag is supposed to be at the N-terminus. So the first part should be the HA tag, then the GADD45G starts. If the HA is correctly added, the sequence after the start codon should be the HA coding sequence.

Wait, but in the given sequence, after ATG, it's TAC. Which is TAC (tyrosine). So perhaps the HA tag was intended to be at the start, but perhaps the HA coding sequence has a different start.

Wait, HA is a transmembrane protein, but the HA tag is a short peptide. The HA tag's coding sequence starts with ATG TAC GAT GGT TAC GAT GGT ... or something like that. Wait, let me think. The HA tag is about 11 amino acids. So the coding DNA would be 33 bases.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the order. The construct is HA tag followed by GADD45G. So the first codons should be the HA sequence.

Looking at the provided sequence: The first few codons after ATG are TAC, which is tyrosine. Then CCC (proline), then ATA (isoleucine), then CGA (R), etc.

Wait, if the HA tag's sequence is supposed to start the coding sequence, then perhaps the coding sequence starts correctly. Let me check, the HA tag is about 11 amino acids. So the first 33 bases (11 codons) should be the HA tag.

Let me see: The provided sequence starts with ATG TAC CCC ATA CGA TGT TCC AGA TTA CGC CAA ATG ACT CTG GAA GAA TCC GCG GCC AGG ACA CAG TTT CC...

So the first 11 codons (33 bases) would be:

1. ATG (M)
2. TAC (Y)
3. CCC (P)
4. ATA (I)
5. CGA (R)
6. TGT (C)
7. TCC (S)
8. AGA (R)
9. TTA (L)
10. CGC (R)
11. CAA (Q)

Wait, that's 11 codons. So the HA tag is supposed to be the first 11 amino acids. But if the HA tag is, say, YPYDVPDYA, which is 10 amino acids, then the coding sequence is 30 bases, or maybe 33 including the start codon.

Wait, my knowledge is a bit hazy, but the key point is that the HA tag's DNA is supposed to be in frame. If their construct has an extra base or a deletion, it could cause a frame shift, leading to a different reading frame.

Wait, but the given sequence starts with ATG TAC CCC..., so perhaps the HA tag is correctly in frame. But the problem is that the protein isn't being expressed.

Looking at the options:

Option A: The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation. So maybe a mutation in the HA tag's DNA. But how would that prevent the protein from being expressed? It would just produce a mutated HA tag, but the rest should be okay. Unless the mutation caused a premature stop codon. Let me check the first 11 codons after ATG.

Wait, in the given sequence, the first 11 codons are as I wrote: Y, P, I, R, C, S, R, L, R, Q. Wait, wait, no, the first codon is ATG (M), then TAC is Y, next is CCC (P), then ATA (I), then CGA (R), TGT (C), TCC (S), AGA (R), TTA (L), CGC (R), CAA (Q). So the 11 amino acids after the start would be M Y P I R C S R L R Q.

Wait, that doesn't make sense for the HA tag. The HA tag is YPYDVPDYA. So the DNA for that would be TAC GAT GGT TAC GAT GGT TAT GAA TAA. Or something like that. So the first few codons would be TAC (Y), GAT (D), GGT (G), etc.

Wait, in the provided sequence, the first codon after ATG is TAC (Y), then CCC (P). Wait, that's P instead of D. So that's different. So perhaps the HA tag has a mistake in the DNA sequence. So the first codon is TAC (Y), then CCC (P), but the HA would expect GAT (D) next. So that's a problem. So the HA sequence is incorrect, leading to a missense mutation, which would be option A.

Alternatively, perhaps the mistake is that the HA tag is not in the correct frame. If the HA's DNA was inserted in the wrong frame, that would cause a completely different amino acid sequence. But the initial codon after ATG is TAC, which is the same as HA's first codon. So perhaps the HA is correctly in frame, but the second codon is wrong.

Wait, the HA tag's amino acid sequence is YPYDVPDYA. So the first three amino acids are Y, P, Y. So the first three codons should be TAC (Y), CCC (P), TAC (Y). But in the given sequence, the first three codons after ATG are TAC (Y), CCC (P), then ATA (I). Wait, that's I instead of Y. So that's a mutation. So the third codon in the HA sequence should be TAC again, but it's ATA here. So that's a missense mutation. So the HA tag's second Y is now I. So that's a mutation in the HA sequence.

So this would make the HA tag incorrect. But would that prevent the expression of the entire protein? If the HA is messed up, would the ribosome terminate early?

Wait, no. If there's a missense mutation in the HA tag, the protein would still be produced but with a wrong HA sequence. But the question is that the protein isn't being overexpressed. So maybe the HA tag's mutation causes the protein to be recognized as incorrect, leading to degradation, or maybe it's causing a premature stop codon.

Alternatively, perhaps the issue is that the HA tag insertion disrupts the reading frame, causing a premature stop codon. But in this case, the first codon is correct, so the frame isn't shifted. So the HA would be expressed, but not correctly.

Wait, but the problem is that the GADD45G isn't being overexpressed. So perhaps the HA tag is causing the construct to have a premature stop codon, leading to a truncated protein. Or perhaps the HA tag is in the wrong frame, causing a stop codon downstream.

Wait, I think I need to look for a stop codon in the sequence. Let's see. The DNA sequence is given as the plus strand, so the mRNA would be complementary to this. So any in-frame TGA, TAG, or TAA would be a stop codon.

Looking at the sequence, let's scan for these.

Looking at the sequence:

5' ATG TAC CCC ATA CGA TGT TCC AGA TTA CGC CAA ATG ACT CTG GAA GAA TCC GCG GCC AGG ACA CAG TTT CC...

Hmm. Let's look for stop codons in the reading frame.

The first 11 codons have:

1. ATG (M)
2. TAC (Y)
3. CCC (P)
4. ATA (I)
5. CGA (R)
6. TGT (C)
7. TCC (S)
8. AGA (R)
9. TTA (L)
10. CGC (R)
11. CAA (Q)

No stop codons here. Then, after that, let's continue.

So the next codons after the initial 11:

ACT (T), CTG (L), GAA (E), GAA (E), TCC (S), GCG (A), GCC (A), AGG (R), ACA (T), CAG (Q), TTT (F), etc.

Wait, I see TAA later. Let's see: looking at codon 23:

After the first 11, the 12th codon is ATG (M). Then 13: ACT (T), 14: CTG (L), 15: GAA (E), 16: GAA (E), 17: TCC (S), 18: GCG (A), 19: GCC (A), 20: AGG (R), 21: ACA (T), 22: CAG (Q), 23: TTT (F), 24: CCG (P), 25: GGA (G), 26: GAG (E), 27: GCT (A), 28: CGC (R), 29: TGG (W), 30: CTG (L), etc.

Wait, at position 11, it's CAA (Q). Then position 12: ATG (M) again. So that's a start codon. Wait, that's a problem. Because the first start codon is ATG, and then after 11 codons, another ATG. So that would mean that the ribosome would start translating from there. That's a big issue. Because the first ATG is the start codon, producing a peptide that starts with M, followed by Y, P, I, R, C, S, R, L, R, Q, M... Wait, that can't be right. The presence of another ATG in frame might cause the ribosome to restart, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the second ATG is causing a frameshift, but the reading frame is same.

Wait, wait, the initial ATG is followed by 11 codons, then another ATG. So the first ATG is the start, then 11 codons, then another ATG, which would be the 12th codon. So the sequence is:

1. ATG (start)
2. TAC (Y)
3. CCC (P)
4. ATA (I)
5. CGA (R)
6. TGT (C)
7. TCC (S)
8. AGA (R)
9. TTA (L)
10. CGC (R)
11. CAA (Q)
12. ATG (M)
13. ACT (T)
14. CTG (L)
...

So the ribosome would read the first ATG and start translating. After 11 codons, the 12th is another ATG. So that would produce a new start codon in the middle of the coding sequence. But I'm not sure if that's a problem. Wait, no, because the ribosome would have already started translating from the first ATG.

But wait, when the ribosome is translating, it goes through each codon. When it encounters an ATG in the middle, would it start a new peptide? I think not. The ribosome only starts at the first ATG. So perhaps that's not the issue.

Wait, but the presence of a second ATG might not directly cause a problem. Unless, perhaps, the second ATG is followed by a stop codon, leading to a shorter peptide. Let's check after the second ATG.

So after the second ATG (position 12), the next codons are ACT (T), CTG (L), GAA (E), GAA (E), TCC (S), GCG (A), GCC (A), AGG (R), ACA (T), CAG (Q), TTT (F), CCG (P), GGA (G), GAG (E), GCT (A), CGC (R), TGG (W), CTG (L), etc.

Looking for any in-frame stop codons. Let's see:

ACT (T) is codon 13, CTG (L) 14, GAA (E) 15, GAA (E) 16, TCC (S) 17, GCG (A) 18, GCC (A) 19, AGG (R) 20, ACA (T) 21, CAG (Q) 22, TTT (F) 23, CCG (P) 24, GGA (G)25, GAG (E)26, GCT (A)27, CGC (R)28, TGG (W)29, CTG (L)30.

Looking for TAG, TGA, or TAA. I see TAA at codon 11 (CAA is Q, but wait, the 11th codon is CAA (Q), then 12 is ATG (M). So the 11th codon is CAA, which is Q. So no TAA there. Let me check further.

At codon 30: CTG (L). Then the next codons:

After codon 30: GAG (E), ACT (T), TGG (W), etc. Hmm, not seeing any stop codons in the sequence. So that's not it.

Wait, but perhaps the second ATG is causing the ribosome to terminate early because of a frameshift elsewhere. Or perhaps the insertion of the HA tag caused a frameshift, leading to a premature stop codon.

Wait, in the given sequence, the first 11 codons after ATG are Y P I R C S R L R Q. Then another ATG (codon 12). So perhaps the HA tag is correctly in frame, but the next codon is not part of the HA tag. So perhaps the initial HA tag was intended to be 10 amino acids, but with the ATG in the sequence, it's longer.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that the HA tag's coding sequence wasn't correctly inserted, leading to a frame shift, but in this case, the frame is maintained because the initial codon is correct.

Another possibility: the HA tag is correctly inserted, but the GADD45G sequence has a premature stop codon. But in the given sequence, I don't see any stop codons until perhaps much later. Let me check again.

Wait, in the sequence, the 5' end is given. Let's look for TAA, TAG, or TGA in the mRNA reading frame.

The mRNA would be complementary to the DNA's plus strand. So the mRNA would be:

The DNA is:

5' ATG TAC CCC ATA CGA TGT TCC AGA TTA CGC CAA ATG ACT CTG GAA GAA TCC GCG GCC AGG ACA CAG TTT CC ...

So the mRNA is:

AUG UAC CCC AUU CGA UAC UUG AGA UUC GCG GCC AGG ACA CAG AAA ...

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. The mRNA is complementary to the DNA's coding (plus) strand. So each DNA base is replaced by its complement, then read as mRNA. So for example, the DNA is 5' ATG..., so mRNA is AUG... because DNA's T becomes A in mRNA.

Wait, no, wait. The DNA's coding strand is the same as the mRNA, except T becomes U. So for the given DNA sequence, the mRNA is the same as the DNA's plus strand, except T becomes U.

So the mRNA is: 

AUG UAC CCC AUU CGA UAC UUG AGA UUC GCG GCC AGG ACA CAG AAA ...

Wait, let me look for stop codons in the mRNA. The first codon is AUG (start). Then UAC (Y), CCC (P), AUU (I), CGA (R), UAC (Y), UUG (L), AGA (R), UUC (S), GCG (A), GCC (A), AGG (R), ACA (T), CAG (Q), AAA (K), etc.

Wait, I'm not seeing any stop codons in the initial part. Let me go further.

Continuing the mRNA sequence:

... TTA CGC CAA ATG ACT CTG GAA GAA TCC GCG GCC AGG ACA CAG TTT CC ...

Wait, wait, perhaps I got lost. Let me reconstruct the mRNA from the DNA sequence.

The DNA sequence is:

5' ATG TAC CCC ATA CGA TGT TCC AGA TTA CGC CAA ATG ACT CTG GAA GAA TCC GCG GCC AGG ACA CAG TTT CC ...

So mRNA is:

AUG UAC CCC AUU CGA UAC UUG AGA UUC GCG GCC AGG ACA CAG AAA ...

Wait, maybe I'm missing some parts. Let's do this step by step.

DNA: ATG TAC CCC ATA CGA TGT TCC AGA TTA CGC CAA ATG ACT CTG GAA GAA TCC GCG GCC AGG ACA CAG TTT CC ...

mRNA: AUG UAC CCC AUU CGA UAC UUG AGA UUC GCG GCC AGG ACA CAG AAA ...

Wait, the mRNA continues: after CAG AAA comes GCT GAG GAC GAG GGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA3'

So the mRNA would be the same as the DNA's plus strand but with T→U.

Looking for stop codons (UAA, UAG, UGA) in the mRNA. Let me scan:

Looking for UAA, UAG, or UGA in the mRNA.

After the initial part, let's see:

Looking for UAA: Hmm, in the DNA, I see CAG (Q) and then TAA (position 11: CAA is Q in DNA, but in mRNA it's CAG (Q), then the next DNA codon is TTA (L), mRNA is UUA (L).

Wait, perhaps I should look for the triplet UAA in the mRNA. Let's see.

Looking through the mRNA:

AUG UAC CCC AUU CGA UAC UUG AGA UUC GCG GCC AGG ACA CAG AAA ...

Wait, the mRNA has CAG AAA. So that's Gln-Lys. No stop there.

Further on, after the second ATG:

ACT CTG GAA GAA TCC GCG GCC AGG ACA CAG TTT ...

So mRNA:

ACT → Thr, CTG → Leu, GAA → Glu, GAA → Glu, TCC → Ser, GCG → Ala, GCC → Ala, AGG → Arg, ACA → Thr, CAG → Gln, TTT → Phe.

No stops.

Continuing:

CGG GAA GAG GCG GGG TGC GCC GGC GAC CTG CAG CGG CGC AGA GGC GGC GAC CGT GGC GGC GCC GGC GAC CTG CAG CGG CGC TGC GGC GGC GAC CGT GGC GGC GCC GGC GAC CTG CAG CGG CGC TGC GGC GGC GAC CGT GGC GGC GCC GGC GAC CTG CAG CGG CGC TGC GGC GGC GAC CGT GGC GGC GCC GGC GAC CTG CAG CGG CGC TGC GGC GGC GAC CGT GGC GGC GCC GGC GAC CTG CAG CGG CGC TGC GGC GGC GAC CGT GGC GGC GCC GGC GAC CTG CAG CGG CGC TGC GGC GGC GAC CGT GGC GGC GCC GGC GAC CTG CAG CGG CGC TGC GGC GGC GAC CGT GGC GGC GCC GGC GAC CTG CAG CGG CGC TGC GGC GGC GAC CGT GGC GGC GCC GGC GAC CTG CAG CGG CGC TGC GGC GGC GAC CGT GGC GGC GCC GGC GAC CTG CAG CGG CGC TGC GGC GGC GAC CGT GGC GGC GCC GGC GAC CTG CAG CGG CGC TGC GGC GGC GAC CGT GGC GGC GCC GGC GAC CTG CAG CGG CGC TGC GGC GGC GAC CGT GGC GGC GCC GGC GAC CTG CAG CGG CGC TGC GGC.

Wait, I'm getting lost, but perhaps I should look for UAA, UAG, UGA in the entire mRNA.

Wait, in the DNA, looking for TAA, TAG, or TGA. Because in the DNA, the mRNA is built from it. So in the DNA, any TAA would become UAA in mRNA, which is a stop.

Looking through the DNA sequence:

Looking for TAA, TAG, TGA in the DNA's plus strand.

The DNA sequence is:

5' ATG TAC CCC ATA CGA TGT TCC AGA TTA CGC CAA ATG ACT CTG GAA GAA TCC GCG GCC AGG ACA CAG TTT CC ...

- CGOkay, so I've got this question about a genetics experiment that's not working as expected, and I need to figure out why. Let's try to break it down step by step.

The scenario is that a researcher is trying to create a transgenic mouse model where the GADD45G protein is overexpressed. They're using a plasmid with an inducible promoter, and they've added a hemagglutinin tag at the N-terminus of the protein. They transfected Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells using Lipofectamine, selected for antibiotic resistance, but they can't overexpress the protein. So, something's wrong with their construct.

The question provides the DNA sequence of the plus strand of their construct. They're looking for the reason why the protein isn't being expressed. The options are A to D. Let me think about each possibility.

First, the construct starts with the ATG, which is the start codon. Then there's a sequence that's probably the hemagglutinin tag. Then the coding sequence for GADD45G follows. But the researcher isn't seeing the protein expressed. So, what could be wrong here?

Looking at the DNA sequence provided, I should check for any issues that could prevent proper translation. One possible issue is a premature stop codon, which would cause the ribosome to terminate early, leading to a truncated protein that might not be detected. Alternatively, there could be a problem with the reading frame, causing a frameshift, but looking at the sequence, I don't see any obvious frameshifts. Another possibility is that the stop codon is present earlier than expected, or in the wrong place.

Wait, stop codons are UAA, UAG, or UGA. Let me look for those in the mRNA sequence. But wait, the given DNA is the coding (sense) strand, so the mRNA would be complementary to this. So to find stop codons in the mRNA, I need to look for the complementary sequences.

Wait, the DNA is plus strand, which is same as mRNA except T instead of U. So the mRNA would be same but with U instead of T. So looking for UAA, UAG, UGA in the mRNA.

Looking through the DNA, any T's that could form a stop codon when read as mRNA.

Looking for sequences that would translate to a stop codon.

Let me scan the DNA sequence for the complementary of stop codons. Let's see:

- mRNA UAA would come from DNA ATTTA, but wait, no. Wait, the mRNA is synthesized from the DNA template (antisense) strand, which is complementary to the sense strand.

Wait, the plasmid's plus strand is given as the coding sequence (after transcription, mRNA is same as plus strand, replacing T with U). So in the plasmid's plus strand, looking for sequences that would code for a stop codon.

Stop codons are UAA, UAG, UGA. So in the DNA, that would be TAA, TAG, TGA on the coding (plus) strand, but wait, no. Wait, the coding strand is the same as mRNA. So for a stop codon in the mRNA, the DNA must have TAA (since mRNA UAA is complementary to DNA ATT), wait, no. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, DNA has two strands: the sense (coding) strand and the antisense (template) strand. The mRNA is synthesized from the antisense strand, which is complementary to the sense strand. So the mRNA sequence is same as the sense (plus) strand, but with T replaced by U.

So for the mRNA to have a stop codon, the sense DNA must have the corresponding sequence. For example, mRNA UAA would correspond to DNA TAA on the sense strand. Similarly, mRNA UAG would be DNA TAG, and mRNA UGA would be DNA TGA.

So let me scan the given DNA sequence for TAA, TAG, or TGA.

Looking at the DNA sequence:

Looking for TAA: 

Looking at the sequence, I see a few areas. Let me go through each line.

5' ATG TAC CCC ATA CGA TT...
Hmm, first part is ATG which is start. Then TAC (tyrosine), CCC (proline), etc.

Looking for TAA: Let's scan through.

Looking through the sequence:

After the start ATG, let's see:

The next part is TAC (Tyr), then CCC (Pro), ATA (Ile), CGA (Arg), TT (but not enough), etc. Wait, in the middle I see "GATGTTCCAGATTACGCCA", so looking for TAA.

Wait, maybe later in the sequence. Let's see:

Looking at the latter part:

...CTGGAAGAAGTCCGCGGCCAGGACACAGTTCCGGAAAGCACAGCCAGGATGCAGGGTGCCGGGAAAGCGCTGCATGAGTTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA3'

Looking for TAA, TAG, TGA sequences.

Wait, near the end, I see "GTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA".

Looking for TAA: Hmm, in the middle I see "TGA" at the end of the sequence. Let's see:

The last line ends with ...GAGTGA. So the last part is GAGTGA.

So the last part of the plus strand is ...GAGTGA. So that would be in the mRNA as GAG UGA, which is a stop codon at position UGA. Because UGA is a stop codon.

Wait wait, let me check:

The last part of the DNA is ...GAGTGA. So the mRNA would be ...GAG UGA. So the UGA is a stop codon. So that's a problem because the construct would terminate translation early.

Wait, but where is this UGA located? Let me look for the point. The DNA sequence ends with ...GAGTGA. So the mRNA would be ...GAG UGA. So the protein would stop at that point, which is before the intended end of the protein.

But wait, the construct is supposed to express the GADD45G protein with the HA tag. So if there's a stop codon in the middle, the protein would be truncated, and maybe not expressed at all, or not detected because it's too small.

So the plus strand ends with ...GAGTGA, meaning the mRNA ends with ...GAG UGA. So the UGA is a stop codon. So the ribosome would terminate at that point, resulting in a much shorter protein than expected.

So why is there a UGA in the middle? Because the construct includes the HA tag, but perhaps the HA tag's sequence introduced a stop codon.

Wait, the HA tag is at the N-terminus. So the construct starts with HA, then GADD45G. Did the HA tag's sequence include a stop codon?

Wait, the HA tag is the hemagglutinin antigenic determinant. The HA tag is typically short, like a few amino acids. For example, HA tag is usually something like YPYDVPDYA (from the influenza HA protein), but the exact sequence can vary. So the coding sequence for the HA tag would be a short stretch of DNA.

But looking at the given DNA sequence, the first part is ATGTACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCCAAATGACTCTGGAAGAAGTCCGCGGCCAGGACACAGTTCCGGAAAGCACAGCCAGGATGCAGGGTGCCGGGAAAGCGCTGCATGAGTTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA.

Wait, the first part is ATG (start). Then TAC (tyr), then CCC (pro), then ATA (ile), CGA (arg), TCC (ser), AGA (arg), TAC (tyr), GCC (ala), etc. So the HA tag's coding sequence is at the very beginning.

Wait, the HA tag is supposed to be at the N-terminus, so the start codon is followed by the HA sequence, then GADD45G.

But wait, the HA tag's DNA is supposed to be just that—some short sequence. So if the HA tag's DNA includes a stop codon, but that's unlikely because the HA tag is a short peptide. But perhaps the way the construct was designed introduced a stop codon.

Wait, the problem is that the UGA is in the middle of the coding sequence, causing the ribosome to terminate early. So the HA tag is followed by the GADD45G coding sequence, but the UGA is in the middle of that, causing a premature stop.

Alternatively, perhaps the UGA is part of the HA tag's sequence, but that's unlikely because HA is short and the UGA is at the end.

Wait, looking again, the UGA is towards the end of the entire construct. Let me count where the HA tag is. The HA tag is the first part after the start codon. So the HA coding sequence would be, say, 10 nucleotides or so. Then comes the GADD45G coding sequence.

But in the sequence provided, the UGA is near the end of the entire construct. So perhaps the HA tag is being correctly expressed, but the GADD45G has a stop codon in it. Or perhaps the construct wasn't designed correctly.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the gene has an early termination codon due to a mutation introduced when inserting the HA tag. So when the HA tag was inserted, a stop codon was introduced.

Looking at the sequence, let's see if the UGA is in the middle of the HA tag or in GADD45G.

Wait, the HA tag is at the very beginning. The UGA is way towards the end of the whole DNA sequence, so it's in the GADD45G coding region. Hmm, but why would that be a problem?

Wait, but perhaps the HA tag is correctly inserted, and GADD45G is correctly inserted, but in the process, a stop codon was introduced. So the HA tag is correctly added, but the GADD45G's coding sequence has a stop codon in it. So the protein would be made up to that point, and the HA tag would be attached to a small fragment.

But why would the HA tag be a problem? No, the HA is at the N-terminus, and the GADD45G follows. So the stop codon is within the GADD45G, causing the protein to terminate prematurely.

But where in the GADD45G coding sequence is this stop codon? Let's see. The HA tag is the first part; after that comes GADD45G's coding sequence. The UGA is near the end of the entire construct.

Wait, the given DNA sequence is the coding (sense) strand. Let me look for the presence of a stop codon within the GADD45G sequence.

Wait, the researcher's construct includes the HA tag followed by GADD45G. So the UGA is in the GADD45G, which would cause the protein to stop early. That would mean that the GADD45G isn't being expressed correctly.

But the problem is that the protein isn't being overexpressed at all. So perhaps the stop codon is in the HA tag, which would prevent the GADD45G from being expressed because the ribosome would stop at the HA tag.

Wait, wait a minute. The HA tag is at the N-terminus. So the HA coding sequence comes right after the start codon. So the mRNA after the start codon would be the HA sequence, followed by GADD45G. If the HA sequence introduced a stop codon, then the ribosome would terminate before even getting to GADD45G.

So let me check the HA coding sequence. The HA tag is a short peptide, so the DNA should encode, say, 6 amino acids. Let's see the initial part of the DNA:

ATG TAC CCC ATA CGA TTA CCA GAT TAC GCC AAA TGA CTC TGG AAG AAG TCC GCC CGG ACA CAG TTA ... etc.

Wait, the start is ATG (Met), then TAC (Tyr), then CCC (Pro), then ATA (Ile), CGA (Arg), TTA (Leu), CCA (Pro), GAT (Asp), TAC (Tyr), GCC (Ala), AAA (Lys), TGA (stop). Oh wait, TGA is a stop codon (UGA in mRNA). So the HA coding sequence includes a stop codon.

So the HA sequence is: ATG TAC CCC ATA CGA TTA CCA GAT TAC GCC AAA TGA.

Wait, so that's the HA tag plus a stop codon. But wait, when you add a tag, you don't want a stop codon in the middle. Because the ribosome would terminate after the HA, not expressing the rest of the protein. So the HA would be followed by a stop codon, preventing the GADD45G from being expressed.

So the coding sequence after the HA would have a stop codon, making the entire construct produce only the HA tag and nothing else. Thus, the GADD45G wouldn't be expressed, so the researcher doesn't see the overexpression.

But wait, the HA tag is supposed to be at the N-terminus, followed by GADD45G. So the construct should have the HA coding, then the GADD45G coding, then the stop codon at the end of the GADD45G. But in the given DNA sequence, the HA coding includes a stop codon (TGA), which would terminate the translation prematurely, before the GADD45G is even translated.

Alternatively, perhaps the HA tag was inserted in a way that introduced a stop codon in the HA sequence, making the HA itself a short peptide.

So the mistake here is that the HA tag's coding sequence includes a stop codon, causing the ribosome to terminate early. Thus, the GADD45G isn't expressed, and the HA is a short peptide, or maybe not even expressed because the stop is in the middle.

Wait, looking at the given DNA sequence again. The HA tag is the first part after ATG, and then it's followed by the coding for GADD45G. But within the HA coding, there's a TGA, which is a stop codon. So the ribosome would read the HA, hit the stop, and terminate, so the GADD45G isn't expressed.

So the problem is that the HA tag's coding sequence includes a stop codon (TGA in the plus strand, which would be UGA in the mRNA), causing the ribosome to terminate early. So the HA tag is not properly expressed, and the downstream GADD45G isn't expressed either.

So which option matches this? Looking at the options:

Option B: The ribosome terminated the translation early.

Option A: Missense mutation in HA. That would change an amino acid but not necessarily cause a stop.

Option C: Lack of linker causing proteolysis. That's about the protein being broken down, but the issue is that it's not expressed.

Option D: No tRNA for UAA. No, because the stop codon here is UGA, but also, there are tRNAs for all stop codons.

So the correct reason is that the ribosome is terminating early because of a stop codon in the coding sequence, which is the HA tag's coding region.

So the correct answer is option B.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The researcher is attempting to create a transgenic mouse model to overexpress the GADD45G protein with an N-terminal hemagglutinin (HA) tag. However, the protein is not being expressed as expected. The provided DNA sequence of the plus strand reveals that the issue lies within the construct.

The HA tag is supposed to be at the N-terminus, followed by the GADD45G coding sequence. However, within the HA coding sequence, there is a premature stop codon (TGA in the DNA, which corresponds to UGA in the mRNA). This stop codon causes the ribosome to terminate translation early, preventing the full-length HA-tagged GADD45G protein from being expressed. Instead, only a truncated peptide corresponding to the HA tag is produced, and the GADD45G sequence remains unexpressed.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: A missense mutation in the HA tag would alter an amino acid but would not necessarily cause a premature stop codon. This is not the issue here.
- **Option B**: The presence of a stop codon (UGA) in the HA coding sequence causes the ribosome to terminate translation prematurely, which aligns with the observed lack of protein expression.
- **Option C**: A lack of linker sequence could lead to proteolysis, but the problem here is that the protein is not being expressed at all, not degraded after expression.
- **Option D**: The absence of a tRNA for a stop codon is not relevant, as stop codons are not translated into amino acids and do not require tRNAs.

The root cause of the issue is the premature stop codon in the HA coding sequence, leading to early termination of translation. 

Answer: B
