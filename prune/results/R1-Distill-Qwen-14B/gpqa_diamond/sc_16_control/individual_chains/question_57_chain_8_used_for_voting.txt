Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about elastic scattering of electrons from a nuclear target. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think.

The question gives me some phase shifts: δ₀ is 90 degrees, δ₁ is 67, δ₂ is 55, δ₃ is 30, and δ₄ is 13. They tell me to ignore the rest of the phase shifts. Wait, so what does that mean? Oh right, I think in scattering theory, each partial wave has a phase shift, and when you ignore higher-order terms beyond a certain point, you're considering only the first few terms. So here, maybe I'm supposed to consider up to δ₄ and ignore δ₅ and beyond.

The task is to calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. I remember that the scattering amplitude, f(θ), is given by a sum over all the partial waves. The general formula I think is f(θ) = (1/k) * sum [ (u_l (θ) ) * (something with the phase shifts) ].

Wait, more specifically, the partial wave expansion for the scattering amplitude is f(θ) = (1/k) sum_{l=0}^∞ [ ( (2l + 1) / (2ik) ) * ( (sin(δ_l) ) / (cos δ_l - cos θ) ) ) ].

But wait, when θ is 0 degrees, which means the scattering is along the incident beam direction. So θ = 0. Plugging that into the equation, cosθ is 1. So the denominator becomes cosδ_l - 1. Hmm, but wait, I also remember that for θ = 0, the expression simplifies a bit.

Alternatively, another approach: The imaginary part of the scattering amplitude, Im(f), is given by the sum over l of ( (2l +1)/(2k) ) * sin(δ_l) / (1 - cos δ_l). Because when θ=0, cosθ=1, so the denominator in the partial wave expansion becomes (1 - cosδ_l).

Wait, let me get that straight. The expression for f(θ) in the partial wave expansion is:

f(θ) = (1/k) sum [ ( (2l +1) / (2ik) ) * ( (sin δ_l) / (cos δ_l - cos θ) ) ) ]

So for θ=0, cosθ=1. So each term becomes ( (2l+1)/(2ik) ) * (sin δ_l) / (cos δ_l - 1) )

Which can be rewritten as ( (2l+1) sin δ_l ) / ( 2ik (cos δ_l - 1) ) )

So the imaginary part of f is the sum of the imaginary parts of each term. Since each term has a 1/(ik), which is -i/k, so when you take the imaginary part, perhaps it's easier to compute each term's contribution.

Wait, let me think about each term's imaginary part. The term is ( (2l+1) sin δ_l ) / ( 2ik (cos δ_l -1) )

Let me write this as ( (2l+1) sin δ_l ) * [ 1/(2ik (cos δ_l -1)) ]

Which can be rewritten as ( (2l+1) sin δ_l ) / ( 2i k (cos δ_l -1) )

The imaginary part of a complex number is the coefficient of i when the expression is written in terms of i. So, considering that 1/i = -i, perhaps I can factor this differently.

Wait, maybe it's easier to note that 1/(i) = -i, so 1/(ik) = -i/k. So each term becomes:

( (2l+1) sin δ_l ) * ( -i/(2 k (cos δ_l -1) ) )

So each term is a real multiple multiplied by -i. The imaginary part of the entire term is then the real multiple itself, because it's of the form (something) * i.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The term is (something) * (-i)/(2k (cos δ_l -1) )

So, the term is a real number multiplied by (-i). So the imaginary part of that term is the real coefficient. Because when you have a term like x * (-i), the imaginary part is x*(-1), but wait, no, because when you write a complex number as a + ib, the imaginary part is b. If the term is 0 + (-x)i, then the imaginary part is -x. So the imaginary part of each term is (- (2l+1) sin δ_l ) / (2k (cos δ_l -1) ) )

Wait, but wait: Let me represent each term as T_l. Then T_l = (2l +1)/(2ik) * sin δ_l/(cos δ_l - 1 )

Which can be written as (2l+1) sin δ_l / [ 2i k (cos δ_l -1) ]

So, T_l is (2l+1) sin δ_l / [ 2i k (cos δ_l -1) ]

To find the imaginary part of the entire f(θ=0), which is sum of T_l's, I need to find the imaginary part of each T_l and sum them.

Each T_l is real multiplied by 1/(i), which is the same as multiplying by -i. Because 1/i = -i.

So, T_l = real_number * (-i) * [ ... ].

So the imaginary part of T_l is the real part of the coefficient, because T_l is purely imaginary. So, for each T_l, Im(T_l) = (2l+1) sin δ_l / ( 2k (cos δ_l -1) )

But wait, wait. Let me compute this.

The denominator is 2i k (cos δ_l -1). So let me write 1/(i) as -i. So T_l = (2l+1) sin δ_l * (-i) / [ 2k (cos δ_l -1) ]

So T_l is [ (2l+1) sin δ_l (-i) ] / [ 2k (cos δ_l -1) ]

So the imaginary part of T_l is [ (2l+1) sin δ_l ] / [ 2k (cos δ_l -1) ] multiplied by (-1), because the term is (-i) multiplied by the rest.

Wait, no. Because when you have a term like A * (-i), the imaginary part is -A. So the imaginary part of T_l is [ (2l+1) sin δ_l ] / [ 2k (cos δ_l -1) ) ] * (-1) ?

Wait, maybe I should approach this differently. Let's express T_l in terms of real and imaginary parts.

Let me compute the denominator first: 2i k (cos δ_l -1) = 2i k (cos δ_l -1) = 2k (cos δ_l -1) * i.

So T_l = (2l+1) sin δ_l / [ 2i k (cos δ_l -1) ]

Which is (2l+1) sin δ_l * [ 1/(2i k (cos δ_l -1) ) ]

Which can be written as (2l+1) sin δ_l * [ -i/(2k (cos δ_l -1) ) ].

So T_l = [ (2l+1) sin δ_l * (-i) ] / [ 2k (cos δ_l -1) ]

So T_l is purely imaginary, with the imaginary part being [ (2l+1) sin δ_l ] / [ 2k (cos δ_l -1) ) ] * (-1/(i)) ?

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused here. Let me think: 1/(i) is -i, so 1/(i) = e^{-i π/2} = -i.

So T_l = (2l+1) sin δ_l * (1/(i)) / [ 2k (cos δ_l -1) ) ]

Which is (2l+1) sin δ_l * (-i) / [ 2k (cos δ_l -1) ) ]

So T_l is [ (2l+1) sin δ_l * (-i) ] / [ 2k (cos δ_l -1) ) ]

Therefore, the imaginary part of T_l is the coefficient of i, which is [ (2l+1) sin δ_l ] / [ 2k (cos δ_l -1) ) ] multiplied by (-1) ?

Wait, no. Because if T_l is [ something ] * (-i), then the imaginary part is the real part of the coefficient times (-1). Because (-i) is 0 - i. So the imaginary part is [ (2l+1) sin δ_l ] / [ 2k (cos δ_l -1) ) ] multiplied by (-1). So Im(T_l) = - [ (2l+1) sin δ_l ] / [ 2k (cos δ_l -1) ) ]

Wait, but wait, that can't be right. Because when you have a term like a*(-i), the imaginary part is a*(-1) because the standard form is a + ib. So if T_l is a*(-i), then the imaginary part is -a. So yes, Im(T_l) is - [ (2l+1) sin δ_l ] / [ 2k (cos δ_l -1) ) ]

But wait, in f(θ=0), each term's contribution to the imaginary part is Im(T_l) = [ (2l+1) sin δ_l ] / [ 2k (1 - cos δ_l ) ]

Because 1/(cos δ_l -1) = -1/(1 - cos δ_l )

Wait, let's compute 1/(cos δ_l -1) = -1/(1 - cos δ_l )

So the denominator term is 2k (cos δ_l -1) = -2k (1 - cos δ_l )

So the expression for Im(T_l) becomes:

Im(T_l) = [ (2l+1) sin δ_l ] / [ 2k (1 - cos δ_l ) ]

Because:

Im(T_l) = - [ (2l+1) sin δ_l ] / [ 2k (cos δ_l -1) ) ]

= [ (2l+1) sin δ_l ] / [ 2k (1 - cos δ_l) ) ]

So the sum over all l of [ (2l+1) sin δ_l ] / [ 2k (1 - cos δ_l ) ]

So the total imaginary part is sum_{l=0}^4 [ (2l+1) sin δ_l ] / [ 2k (1 - cos δ_l ) ]

Because the question says to ignore the rest of the phase shifts beyond δ_4, so we stop at l=4.

Now, I need to compute this sum.

Wait, but what is k? I think k is the wave number, given by k = sqrt(8mE)/(ħ), but perhaps more straightforwardly, using the relation k = (ħ sqrt(2mE)) ) / ħ ?

No, wait, ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. The wave number k is given by k = (sqrt(2mE)) / ħ, but wait, since units are important here, I need to think about the given parameters.

Wait, the electrons are 50 MeV. So the energy is E = 50 MeV. But to find k, I need to compute it in appropriate units.

Wait, but in scattering theory, the formula for k is (sqrt(2mE)) ) / ħ, but I'm a bit confused about the units and the exact expression.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to use the relation that k is given by sqrt(8 m E) / ħ, but I'm not sure. Wait, perhaps the more precise formula is k = sqrt( (2mE) ) / ħ.

Wait, but the units will matter here. Let's see, E is given in MeV. We'll probably need to use natural units where ħ c is about 197.3 MeV fm. But wait, maybe it's easier to compute k in units where ħ = c = 1, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can calculate k in terms of the given energy and the reduced mass. Wait, but wait, in electron scattering from a nucleus, the target is much heavier, so the reduced mass μ is approximately equal to the mass of the electron, m_e.

Wait, but in Coulomb scattering, the reduced mass μ would be (m_e m_target) / (m_e + m_target). Since the target is a nucleus, say, a proton, but even then, m_target is much larger than m_e, so μ ≈ m_e.

So, the wave number k is given by sqrt(2 μ E) / ħ.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the units.

Wait, energy E is 50 MeV. The mass of the electron is about 0.511 MeV/c². So, E is much larger than the rest mass energy. So in the ultrarelativistic limit, the kinetic energy is much larger than m_e c², so the momentum p is approximately sqrt(2 m_e E), ignoring the rest mass. So, perhaps in this case, k ≈ sqrt(2 m_e E) / ħ.

Wait, but E is in MeV, and ħ c is approximately 197.3 MeV fm. So, let's compute k.

Wait, let me write the expression for k:

k = sqrt(2 m_e E) / ħ

But E is given in energy units. Let me convert E to ergs or another unit where I can compute this.

Alternatively, perhaps using natural units where ħ c = 197.3 MeV fm. So in natural units, ħ c ≈ 197.3 MeV fm.

So let's see, E = 50 MeV.

So, the momentum p is sqrt(2 m_e E). But m_e is roughly 0.511 MeV/c².

Wait, m_e c² is 0.511 MeV. So m_e = 0.511 MeV / c².

So, sqrt(2 m_e E) would be sqrt( 2 * (0.511 MeV/c²) * 50 MeV ) ) = sqrt( 2 * 0.511 * 50 ) (MeV²/c²) )^(1/2) = sqrt(51.1) MeV/c.

So, p = sqrt(51.1) MeV/c ≈ 7.15 MeV/c.

But how do I relate p to k? Well, k is p / ħ c, because in natural units where ħ c = 197.3 MeV fm, k (in 1/fm) = p (MeV/c) / (197.3 MeV fm) ) × (1/(ħ c)).

Wait, perhaps I should compute k in units of 1/fm.

Wait, k = p / ħ c.

Wait, p is in MeV/c, and ħ c is 197.3 MeV fm.

So, k (in 1/fm) would be (p) / (197.3) [MeV/c] / [MeV fm] ) = (p) / (197.3) × (1/(MeV/c * MeV fm)) )?

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute k as p / (ħ c) in units where p is in MeV/c, ħ c is 197.3 MeV fm.

So, k = (p) / (ħ c) = [ (sqrt(2 m_e E) ) / (c) ) ] / (ħ c )

Wait, perhaps I'm getting too stuck on the units. Let me try a different approach.

The formula for the wave number k is k = sqrt( (2mE) ) / ħ.

But in units where E is in MeV, m is in MeV/c², and ħ c is about 197.3 MeV fm.

So, let's compute k.

k = sqrt( 2 m_e E ) / ħ

But m_e is 0.511 MeV/c², E is 50 MeV.

So, 2 m_e E = 2 * 0.511 * 50 = 51.1 MeV²/c².

Take the square root: sqrt(51.1) MeV/c ≈ 7.15 MeV/c.

Now, ħ c is approximately 197.3 MeV fm. So, k = (7.15 MeV/c) / (197.3 MeV fm) ) * (1/(ħ c)).

Wait, no, I think I should write k = (p) / (ħ c) ), where p is in MeV/c.

So, k = p / (ħ c) = (7.15 MeV/c) / (197.3 MeV fm) ) × (1/(ħ c)) ?

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing units. Let me think again.

The wave number k is given by k = p / ħ, where p is the momentum. So, since p = sqrt(2 m_e E), then k = sqrt(2 m_e E) / ħ.

But to compute this in 1/fm units, I need to express everything in consistent units.

Another approach: Let's use the expression k = sqrt( (2 m_e E ) ) / ħ, but compute it in natural units where ħ c = 197.3 MeV fm.

Wait, but perhaps another way. The Compton wavelength of the electron is ħ/(m_e c). So, 1/(k) ≈ (m_e c)/ħ * something.

Alternatively, perhaps using the formula for the scattering amplitude and the relation to the impact parameter.

Wait, maybe I can find k in terms of the energy. Let me see.

E = (ħ² k² )/(2 m_e ), since E ≈ p²/(2m), assuming non-relativistic, but since E is 50 MeV and m_e is 0.511 MeV/c², the kinetic energy is dominated by the momentum term. So, E = (ħ² k² )/(2 m_e )

So, solving for k: k² = (2 m_e E ) / ħ²

k = sqrt(2 m_e E ) / ħ

But I need to compute this in units where, say, ħ is in MeV s, and m_e in MeV/c², but I'm getting stuck. Maybe it's easier to use the fact that ħ c = 197.3 MeV fm.

So, let's compute k.

k = sqrt(2 m_e E ) / ħ

= sqrt( 2 * m_e * E ) / ħ

But E is given in MeV, m_e in MeV/c².

Wait, but if I take E in units of MeV, m_e in MeV/c², and ħ in MeV s, etc., perhaps I should convert everything into SI units. But that's time-consuming and perhaps error-prone.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find k in terms of E and (ħ c). Let me see.

Let me write:

k = sqrt(2 m_e E ) / ħ

But, since m_e c^2 = 0.511 MeV,

m_e = (0.511 MeV ) / c².

So,

k = sqrt( 2 * (0.511 MeV / c² ) * E ) / ħ

= sqrt( (2 * 0.511 * E ) MeV * (1/c²) ) ) / ħ

= sqrt( (1.022 E) MeV / c² ) ) / ħ

Hmm, perhaps I can factor out c² in the denominator.

Wait, perhaps I should note that 1/(c²) = (1/ħ c)(ħ c / c²) ) = (ħ c) (1/(c^3 ħ )) )? I'm getting stuck here.

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let's use the relation:

k (in 1/fm) = (p in MeV/c ) / (ħ c in MeV fm )

Because, 1 fm = 1e-15 m, and ħ c is about 197.3 MeV fm. So, if p is in MeV/c, then k = p / (ħ c) = (p in MeV/c) / (197.3 MeV fm) ) * (1 fm^{-1}) )

So, k = p / (197.3 MeV fm) ) = p / 197.3 fm^{-1}.

Wait, that's probably correct.

So, p = sqrt(2 m_e E) ≈ sqrt(2 * 0.511 MeV * 50 MeV ) ) = sqrt(51.1) ≈ 7.15 MeV/c.

So, k = 7.15 MeV/c / (197.3 MeV fm) ) = 7.15 / 197.3 fm^{-1} ≈ 0.0362 fm^{-1}.

Wait, that seems small, but perhaps that's correct.

Wait, let me compute it numerically.

7.15 / 197.3 ≈ 0.0362.

So, k ≈ 0.0362 fm^{-1}.

So, 1/k ≈ 27.6 fm.

Wait, but I'm not sure about the calculation. Let me double-check.

Wait, E = 50 MeV, m_e c² = 0.511 MeV.

So, E is much larger than m_e c², so we can approximate p ≈ sqrt(2 m_e E ) = sqrt(2 * 0.511 *50 ) MeV/c.

Which is sqrt(51.1) ≈7.15 MeV/c.

So, p =7.15 MeV/c.

Then, k = p / (ħ c) ≈ 7.15 / (197.3) fm^{-1} ≈ 0.0362 fm^{-1}.

Yes, that seems correct.

So, k ≈ 0.0362 fm^{-1}.

Now, back to the sum for Im(f):

Im(f) = sum_{l=0}^4 [ (2l+1) sin δ_l ] / [ 2k (1 - cos δ_l ) ]

Compute each term for l=0 to 4.

Let me compute each term step by step.

Compute for l=0:

δ₀=90 degrees.

Compute numerator: (2*0 +1) * sin(90) =1 * 1 = 1.

Denominator: 2k (1 - cos(90)) = 2k (1 - 0 )= 2k.

So, term for l=0: 1/(2k)

Similarly, l=1:

δ₁=67 degrees.

sin(67) ≈ 0.9205.

2l+1=3.

Denominator: 2k (1 - cos(67) )

cos(67)= approximately 0.3907.

So, 1 - cos(67) ≈ 0.6093.

So denominator: 2k * 0.6093.

So term: 3 * 0.9205 / (2k * 0.6093 )

= (2.7615) / (1.2186 k )

≈ 2.7615 / (1.2186 * 0.0362 )

Wait, but wait, let me compute each term step by step.

Wait, perhaps I should compute all the terms and then sum them up.

Let me make a table:

For each l (0 to 4):

Compute (2l+1) sin δ_l, and (1 - cos δ_l )

Then compute each term as [ (2l+1) sin δ_l ] / [ 2k (1 - cos δ_l ) ]

Sum all these terms.

First, compute each part.

Let me compute for each l:

l=0:

δ₀=90 degrees.

sin(90)=1.

cos(90)=0.

So,

(2l+1) sin δ₀ = 1 * 1 =1.

1 - cos δ₀ =1 -0=1.

Term: 1 / [ 2k * 1 ] = 1/(2k )

l=1:

δ₁=67 degrees.

Compute sin(67) ≈ 0.9205.

cos(67)≈0.3907.

(2*1+1)=3.

So,

3 * 0.9205 ≈2.7615.

1 - cos(67)=1-0.3907=0.6093.

Denominator: 2k * 0.6093 = 2*0.0362 *0.6093 ≈ 0.04407.

Term:2.7615 / 0.04407 ≈62.63.

Wait, wait no. Wait, the term is [ (2l+1) sin δ ] / [ 2k (1 - cos δ) ]

So, for l=1, [3 * 0.9205 ] / [ 2k * 0.6093 ]

= (2.7615) / [ 2k * 0.6093 ]

k is 0.0362 fm^{-1}.

So denominator is 2 *0.0362 *0.6093 ≈0.04407 fm^{-1}.

So the term is 2.7615 / 0.04407 ≈62.63 fm.

Wait, but that's a large term, but let me proceed.

l=2:

δ₂=55 degrees.

sin(55) ≈0.8192.

cos(55)≈0.5736.

(2*2+1)=5.

So,

5 *0.8192=4.096.

1 - cos(55)=1-0.5736=0.4264.

Denominator: 2k *0.4264= 2 *0.0362 *0.4264 ≈0.0310.

Term=4.096 / 0.0310 ≈132.13 fm.

l=3:

δ₃=30 degrees.

sin(30)=0.5.

cos(30)=√3/2≈0.8660.

(2*3+1)=7.

So,

7 *0.5=3.5.

1 - cos(30)=1-0.8660=0.1340.

Denominator:2k *0.1340=2*0.0362 *0.1340≈0.00975.

Term=3.5 / 0.00975 ≈358.97 fm.

l=4:

δ₄=13 degrees.

sin(13)≈0.2249.

cos(13)≈0.9744.

(2*4+1)=9.

So,

9 *0.2249≈2.0241.

1 - cos(13)=1-0.9744=0.0256.

Denominator:2k *0.0256=2 *0.0362 *0.0256≈0.00186.

Term=2.0241 /0.00186≈1087.7 fm.

Wait, but that's a big term, but let's check.

Now, let me sum all the terms:

l=0: 1/(2k) = 1/(2 *0.0362) ≈1/(0.0724)≈13.81 fm.

Wait, wait a second. Earlier, for l=0, [ (2l+1) sin δ₀ ] / [ 2k (1 - cos δ₀ ) ].

Which is [1 *1 ] / [ 2k *1 ] = 1/(2k) ≈1/(2*0.0362) ≈13.81 fm.

Wait, but when I computed for l=1, I got about 62.63 fm.

Wait, but when I compute all these terms, the sum will be 13.81 + 62.63 + 132.13 + 358.97 + 1087.7.

Wait, let's compute that:

13.81 +62.63=76.44

76.44 +132.13=208.57

208.57 +358.97=567.54

567.54 +1087.7=1655.24 fm.

Wait, but looking at the options, the choices are in the hundreds of fm, but option A is 87163.4 fm, which is way higher. Hmm, that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the term for l=4. Let me recheck that.

For l=4, the term is [ (2l +1) sin δ ] / [ 2k (1 - cos δ) ]

(2*4+1)=9.

sin(13 degrees)= approx 0.22495.

So, numerator:9 *0.22495≈2.0245.

Denominator:2k*(1 - cos(13)).

1 - cos(13) ≈1-0.97437=0.02563.

2k=2*0.0362=0.0724.

Multiply by 0.02563: 0.0724 *0.02563≈0.001856.

So, denominator is 0.001856.

So, term is 2.0245 / 0.001856 ≈1089.9 fm.

That's correct.

So sum is around 1655 fm, but the options are up to ~355 fm.

Hmm, that suggests that I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I got the formula wrong. Maybe the formula for the imaginary part is the sum over l of [ (2l+1) sin δ_l ] / (2k (1 - cos δ_l )).

Wait, but perhaps the formula is different. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I have the formula reversed. Because I think that for forward scattering (θ=0), the expression might involve (1 + cos δ_l) instead of (1 - cos δ_l ). Wait, let me double-check.

Wait, the partial wave expansion for f(θ) is:

f(θ) = (1/k) sum_{l=0}^∞ [ (2l+1) / (2ik) ) * sin δ_l / ( cos δ_l - cos θ ) ) ]

When θ=0, cos θ=1, so the denominator becomes (cos δ_l -1).

Which is the same as -(1 - cos δ_l ), so sin δ_l/(cos δ_l -1) = - sin δ_l/(1 - cos δ_l )

So then, the term becomes:

(2l+1)/(2ik) * (- sin δ_l) / (1 - cos δ_l )

Which is - (2l+1) sin δ_l / [ 2ik (1 - cos δ_l ) ]

So, the term is [ - (2l+1) sin δ_l ] / [ 2ik (1 - cos δ_l ) ]

So, the imaginary part of each term is the coefficient of i in the denominator.

Wait, the term is [ - (2l+1) sin δ_l ] / [ 2ik (1 - cos δ_l ) ]

Which can be written as [ - (2l+1) sin δ_l ] * [ 1/(2ik (1 - cos δ_l )) ]

Which is [ - (2l+1) sin δ_l ] * [ -i/(2k (1 - cos δ_l )) ].

Because 1/i = -i.

So, the term becomes [ (2l+1) sin δ_l i ] / [ 2k (1 - cos δ_l ) ]

So, the imaginary part of this term is [ (2l+1) sin δ_l ] / [ 2k (1 - cos δ_l ) ]

Thus, Im(T_l) is [ (2l+1) sin δ_l ] / [ 2k (1 - cos δ_l ) ]

Wait, that's the same as before. So the sum is correct.

But then, the sum we computed is about 1655 fm, but the options don't have anything near that. So perhaps I made a mistake in calculating k.

Wait, perhaps I computed k in 1/fm, but the formula requires k in units where 1/(fm) is correct.

Wait, let's recompute k.

Alternative approach: Use the relation between the wavelength and energy.

In natural units where ħ c = 197.3 MeV fm, the wave number k is given by k = sqrt( (2 m_e E ) ) / ħ * something.

Wait, or perhaps a better way: since E = (ħ² k²) / (2 m_e ), solving for k:

k = sqrt( 2 m_e E ) / ħ.

But in natural units, ħ c = 197.3 MeV fm.

So, k = sqrt( 2 m_e E ) / ħ.

But m_e is 0.511 MeV / c².

So, m_e E has units MeV² / c².

So,

k = sqrt(2 * (0.511 MeV/c² ) *50 MeV ) ) / ħ.

= sqrt(51.1 (MeV^2 / c²) ) ) / ħ.

= sqrt(51.1) MeV/(c) / ħ.

But ħ c is 197.3 MeV fm, so ħ = 197.3 MeV fm / c.

Hmm, perhaps substituting that.

k = [√(51.1) MeV/(c) ] / [ 197.3 MeV fm / c ]

The c's cancel.

k = [√51.1 / 197.3 ] (MeV / (MeV fm )) ) * (1/c ) ?

Wait, perhaps I'm getting it wrong. Let me compute numerically.

√51.1 ≈7.15.

So, numerator is 7.15 MeV/c.

Denominator is 197.3 MeV fm.

So,

k = (7.15 MeV/c) / (197.3 MeV fm) ) * (1/c) ?

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute in terms of 1/fm.

Wait, MeV/c divided by MeV fm is (1/(fm * c)).

Wait, perhaps another approach: 1/(ħ c) is 1/(197.3 MeV fm).

So, 1/(ħ c) = 1/(197.3 MeV fm) → unit is (fm MeV)^{-1}.

But I'm getting stuck. Let me try to compute k numerically.

k = sqrt(2 m_e E) / ħ.

m_e = 0.511 MeV/c².

E=50 MeV.

So,

k = sqrt(2 * 0.511 MeV/c² * 50 MeV ) / ħ

= sqrt(51.1 (MeV²/c² )) / ħ.

= 7.15 MeV/c / ħ.

But ħ = (197.3 MeV fm) / c.

So,

k = (7.15 MeV/c ) * c / (197.3 MeV fm )

The c's cancel.

k=7.15 / 197.3 fm^{-1}.

Which is approximately 0.0362 fm^{-1}.

Which is the same as before.

So, that's correct.

Hmm, but then the sum comes out to about 1655 fm, which doesn't match any of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me think again.

Wait, another formula I found in scattering theory: the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude f(θ=0) is given by (1/k) sum_{l=0}^∞ [ (2l+1) sin δ_l ].

Wait, that can't be right. Or maybe it's (1/k) sum [ (2l+1) sin δ_l ].

But that would give a much smaller value.

Wait, let me think. Another approach: The optical theorem states that the total cross-section is related to the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude at θ=0.

The optical theorem says that Im(f(0)) = (k/(4π) ) σ_total, where σ_total is the total cross-section.

But I don't know σ_total here, so perhaps that's not helpful.

Wait, but perhaps I'm confusing the formula. Let me check: The imaginary part of the scattering amplitude at θ=0 is given by Im(f(0)) = (1/k) sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) sin δ_l.

Wait, if that's the case, then the sum is simply sum (2l+1) sin δ_l.

Wait, but that would be much smaller. Let me compute that.

Wait, if Im(f(0)) = (1/k) sum (2l+1) sin δ_l, then:

sum for l=0 to 4:

l=0: 1 * 1 =1.

l=1:3 * sin(67) ≈3 *0.9205=2.7615.

l=2:5 * sin(55)≈5 *0.8192=4.096.

l=3:7 * 0.5=3.5.

l=4:9 * sin(13)≈9 *0.22495≈2.02455.

Sum: 1 + 2.7615=3.7615; +4.096=7.8575; +3.5=11.3575; +2.02455=13.382.

Multiply by 1/k: 13.382 / 0.0362 ≈369.6 fm.

Which is close to option C (177.675 fm) and option D (251.271 fm), but not exactly.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is this.

Wait, but I'm getting conflicting information. So perhaps I need to recheck the initial formula.

Another approach: The partial wave expansion is f(θ) = sum_{l=0}^∞ f_l (θ), where f_l (θ) = (2l+1)/(2ik) * [ sin δ_l / (cos δ_l - cos θ) ]

So, the imaginary part of f is Im( sum f_l ) = sum Im(f_l )

So, for each f_l, Im(f_l ) = Im[ (2l+1)/(2ik) * sin δ_l / (cos δ_l - cos θ) ]

Assuming θ=0, cosθ=1.

So,

f_l = (2l+1)/(2ik) * sin δ_l / (cos δ_l -1 )

= (2l+1) sin δ_l / [ 2i k (cos δ_l -1) ]

Which can be written as [ (2l+1) sin δ_l ] / [ 2i k (cos δ_l -1) ]

The imaginary part of f_l is the coefficient of i in the denominator.

Wait, [ (2l+1) sin δ_l ] / [ 2i k (cos δ_l -1) ] = [ (2l+1) sin δ_l ] * [ 1/(2i k (cos δ_l -1) ) ]

Which is [ (2l+1) sin δ_l ] * [ -i/(2k (cos δ_l -1) ) ]

Because 1/(i) = -i.

So, f_l = [ -i (2l+1) sin δ_l ] / [ 2k (cos δ_l -1) ]

So, the imaginary part of f_l is [ (2l+1) sin δ_l ] / [ 2k (1 - cos δ_l ) ]

Which leads us back to the same formula as before.

Thus, the sum is indeed [ sum (2l+1) sin δ_l / (2k (1 - cos δ_l )) ) ]

So, the previous calculation of about 1655 fm must be correct.

But the options don't have anything near that. So I must have made a wrong assumption somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the formula for Im(f) is actually [ sum (2l+1) sin δ_l ] / (k ), without the (1 - cos δ_l ) denominator.

But let me compute that.

sum (2l+1) sin δ_l:

l=0: 1 *1 =1.

l=1:3 *0.9205≈2.7615.

l=2:5 *0.8192≈4.096.

l=3:7 *0.5=3.5.

l=4:9 *0.22495≈2.02455.

Sum ≈1+2.7615=3.7615; +4.096=7.8575; +3.5=11.3575; +2.02455≈13.382.

Multiply by (1/k)=1/0.0362≈27.62.

13.382 *27.62 ≈368.9 fm.

Which is about 369 fm. But the available options are A:87163 fm, B:355.35 fm, C:177.675 fm, D:251.271 fm.

Hmm, 369 is close to B (355.35), but not exactly. Perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute each term more accurately.

Let me recalculate each term more precisely.

k=0.0362 fm^{-1}.

l=0:

term = 1 / (2k ) = 1/(2 *0.0362 )= 1/0.0724 ≈13.81 fm.

l=1:

(3 * sin(67) )/( 2k (1 - cos 67) )

sin(67)= approx 0.92050485345.

cos(67)= approx 0.39073112848.

1 - cos(67)=0.60926887152.

3*0.92050485345=2.76151456035.

2k=0.0724.

0.0724 *0.60926887152=0.044066.

So, term=2.76151456035 /0.044066≈62.63 fm.

l=2:

(5 * sin(55) )/( 2k (1 - cos55) )

sin(55)= approx 0.81915204428.

cos(55)= approx 0.57357643635.

1 - cos55 ≈0.42642356365.

5 *0.81915204428=4.0957602214.

2k *0.42642356365=0.0724 *0.42642356365 ≈0.030923.

So, term=4.0957602214 /0.030923 ≈132.39 fm.

l=3:

(7 * sin(30) )/( 2k (1 - cos30) )

sin(30)=0.5.

cos(30)=√3/2≈0.86602540378.

1 - cos30≈0.13397459622.

7 *0.5=3.5.

2k *0.13397459622=0.0724 *0.13397459622≈0.009723.

Term=3.5 /0.009723≈360.0 fm.

l=4:

(9 * sin(13) )/( 2k (1 - cos13) )

sin(13 degrees)= approx 0.2249510543.

cos(13)= approx 0.97437006478.

1 - cos13≈0.02562993522.

9 *0.2249510543=2.0245594887.

2k *0.02562993522=0.0724 *0.02562993522≈0.001855.

Term=2.0245594887 /0.001855≈1091.2 fm.

Sum all terms:

13.81 +62.63=76.44.

76.44 +132.39=208.83.

208.83 +360=568.83.

568.83 +1091.2=1660.03 fm.

So the sum is approximately 1660 fm, which is not among the options. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the formula is different. Another possibility: The scattering amplitude's imaginary part is (1/k) sum (2l+1) sin δ_l.

Which would give Im(f)= (1/k) * sum(2l+1) sin δ_l.

sum(2l+1) sin δ_l:

l=0: 1*1=1.

l=1:3*0.9205≈2.7615.

l=2:5*0.8192≈4.096.

l=3:7*0.5=3.5.

l=4:9*0.22495≈2.02455.

Sum=1 +2.7615=3.7615; +4.096=7.8575; +3.5=11.3575; +2.02455=13.382.

Multiply by (1/k)=27.62 (since 1/k=1/0.0362 ≈27.62).

13.382 *27.62 ≈368.9 fm.

Which is about 369 fm. The closest option is B:355.35 fm.

But 369 is not exactly 355.35. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k.

Wait, let's recompute k more accurately.

E=50 MeV.

m_e c²=0.511 MeV.

So,

k= sqrt(2 m_e E) / ħ.

In natural units with ħ c=197.3 MeV fm.

sqrt(2 * 0.511 MeV/c² *50 MeV ) / (ħ )

= sqrt(51.1 MeV²/c² ) / ħ.

= 7.15 MeV/c / ħ.

But ħ = (197.3 MeV fm) / c.

So,

k= (7.15 MeV/c ) * c / (197.3 MeV fm )

= 7.15 / 197.3 fm^{-1}.

7.15 divided by 197.3.

Let me compute 7.15 / 197.3:

197.3 is approximately 200, so 7.15/200=0.03575.

But more accurately:

197.3 × 0.0362 = ?

0.0362 * 200 =7.24, but since it's 197.3, 0.0362 *197.3=7.149.

So, 197.3 * 0.0362 =7.149.

Which is very close to 7.15.

So, k=0.0362 fm^{-1}.

Thus, 1/k=27.62 fm.

Thus, the sum is 13.382 *27.62=368.9 fm.

But the options don't have this value. So perhaps the formula is different, and the correct approach is to compute the sum as (1/(2k)) sum [ (2l+1) sin δ_l / (1 - cos δ_l) ) ]

Wait, but I already did that and got 1660 fm, which is nowhere near the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is (1/(2k)) sum [ (2l+1) sin δ_l ) ].

Which would give (1/(2k)) * 13.382.

13.382/(2*0.0362 )=13.382/(0.0724 )≈185 fm.

Which is close to option C:177.675 fm.

Hmm, that's a possibility. So perhaps the correct formula is Im(f)= (1/(2k)) sum (2l+1) sin δ_l.

So, sum is 13.382, 1/(2k) is 1/0.0724≈13.81.

13.81 *13.382= approx 185 fm.

Which is close to option C:177.675.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is Im(f)= (1/(2k)) sum [ (2l+1) sin δ_l ].

Which would give:

sum(2l+1) sin δ_l=13.382.

1/(2k)=13.81.

13.81 *13.382=185.

Hmm, but this is not matching any option exactly.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the formula for f.

Wait, another thought: The scattering amplitude f(θ=0) is given by (1/k) sum_{l=0}^∞ [ (2l+1) sin δ_l ] / ( 1 - cos δ_l )

Which is the same as the sum we computed earlier, resulting in 1660 fm.

But that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is f(θ=0) = (1/k) sum_{l=0}^∞ [ (2l+1) sin δ_l ].

Which would give 13.382 * 27.62≈369 fm.

But that's not an option either.

Wait, perhaps I've made a mistake in the calculation of the denominator's factor. Let me re-examine the initial formula.

After struggling, I think perhaps the correct answer is option B:355.35 fm.

Wait, but wait, in our calculation, the sum is 369 fm for the formula where the denominator is (1 - cos δ_l ), but that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is (1/k) sum (2l+1) sin (δ_l ), which gives 369 fm, but since it's not an option, perhaps I made a mistake in the value of k.

Wait, perhaps I should compute k more accurately.

Let me compute k again.

E=50 MeV.

m_e c²=0.511 MeV.

So,

k= sqrt( 2 m_e E ) / ħ.

But in natural units where ħ c = 197.3 MeV fm,

sqrt(2 * 0.511 *50 ) MeV/c = sqrt(51.1) MeV/c =7.15 MeV/c.

Thus, k=7.15 MeV/c / (197.3 MeV fm )

=7.15 /197.3 fm^{-1}.

Compute 7.15 divided by 197.3.

Let me compute 7.15 /197.3:

197.3 × 0.0362=7.149.

So, 7.15/197.3=0.0362.

So, k=0.0362 fm^{-1}.

Thus, 1/k=27.62 fm.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should compute each term again more precisely.

l=0:

term = 1/(2k)=1/(0.0724)=13.81 fm.

l=1:

3 * sin(67)=3 *0.92050485345=2.76151456035.

Denominator:2k*(1 -cos67)=0.0724 * (1-0.39073112848)=0.0724 *0.60926887152=0.044066.

term=2.76151456035 /0.044066=62.63 fm.

l=2:

5 * sin(55)=5 *0.81915204428=4.0957602214.

Denominator:0.0724*(1 -0.57357643635)=0.0724*0.42642356365=0.030923.

term=4.0957602214 /0.030923=132.39 fm.

l=3:

7 * 0.5=3.5.

Denominator:0.0724*(1-0.86602540378)=0.0724*0.13397459622=0.009723.

term=3.5 /0.009723=360.0 fm.

l=4:

9 *0.2249510543=2.0245594887.

Denominator:0.0724*(1-0.97437006478)=0.0724*0.02562993522=0.001855.

term=2.0245594887 /0.001855≈1091.2 fm.

Sum is 13.81 +62.63=76.44 +132.39=208.83 +360=568.83 +1091.2=1660.03 fm.

Hmm.

But none of the options match. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is Im(f) = (1/k) sum ( (2l+1) sin δ_l ) / (2 (1 - cos δ_l) )

Which would be sum [ (2l+1) sin δ_l ] / (2k (1 - cos δ_l) )

So, for each term:

l=0:

1/(2k *1 )=1/(2*0.0362)=1/(0.0724)=13.81 fm.

l=1:

(3 *0.9205 )/(2*0.0362 *0.6093 )= (2.7615)/(0.04407 )=62.63 fm.

l=2:

(5 *0.8192 )/(2*0.0362 *0.4264 )= (4.096 )/( 0.03092 )=132.39 fm.

l=3:

(7 *0.5 )/(2*0.0362 *0.13397 )=3.5/(0.009723 )=360 fm.

l=4:

(9 *0.22495 )/(2*0.0362 *0.02563 )= (2.02455)/(0.001857 )=1090 fm.

Sum is same as before: 1660 fm.

No match.

Wait, perhaps the formula is Im(f)= (1/(2k)) sum ( (2l+1) sin δ_l )/(1 - cos δ_l )

Which would be same as before.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is Im(f) = (1/k) sum [ (2l+1) sin δ_l ] / (2 (1 - cos δ_l) )

Which would be the same as before, but with 2 in denominator.

Which we've already done.

Thus, I'm stuck and can't find a way to reach any of the given options. Perhaps the correct answer is option B:355.35 fm, but I can't reconcile my calculations with that.

Wait, perhaps I made an error in the formula. Another source says that the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude at θ=0 is given by (1/k) sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) sin δ_l.

Which would give 13.382 *27.62=369. But closest option is B:355.35.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is (1/(2k)) sum (2l+1) sin δ_l.

Which would be (13.382 )/(2*0.0362 )=13.382/0.0724=185.1 fm.

Which is closest to option C:177.675, but not exact.

Alternatively, perhaps I should recheck the phase shifts.

Wait, another thought: I think I might have made a mistake in the denominator when calculating the terms. Let's re-express the formula.

The term for each l is [ (2l+1) sin δ_l ] / [2k (1 - cos δ_l) ]

Which can be rewritten as [ (2l+1) (1 - cos^2 (δ_l/2))^{1/2} ] / [ 2k (2 sin^2 (δ_l /2)) ) ]

Which simplifies to [ (2l+1) sin (δ_l/2) ] / [4k sin^2 (δ_l/2) ) ]

Wait, no, perhaps not. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the identity 1 - cos δ = 2 sin^2 (δ/2).

So, 1 - cos δ = 2 sin²(δ/2).

Similarly, sin δ = 2 sin (δ/2) cos (δ/2).

So, the term becomes [ (2l+1) * 2 sin (δ/2) cos (δ/2) ] / [ 2k * 2 sin^2 (δ/2) ) ]

Which simplifies to [ (2l+1) cos(δ/2) ] / [ 2k sin(δ/2) ]

= [ (2l+1) ] / [ 2k tan(δ/2) ]

Hmm, that's an interesting approach. Let me compute each term this way.

l=0, δ=90:

tan(45)=1.

So,

term=1/(2k *1 )=1/(2k )=13.81 fm.

l=1, δ=67: tan(33.5)≈0.662.

So,

term=3/(2k *0.662 )=3/(2*0.0362 *0.662 )=3/(0.0474 )=63.33 fm.

l=2, δ=55: tan(27.5)≈0.524.

term=5/(2k *0.524 )=5/(0.0724 *0.524*2 )

Wait, wait, 2k * tan(δ/2).

Wait, 2k=0.0724.

tan(55/2)=tan(27.5)=0.524.

So,

term=5/(0.0724 *0.524 )=5/(0.0379 )≈131.9 fm.

l=3, δ=30: tan(15)=0.2679.

term=7/(0.0724 *0.2679 )=7/(0.01938 )≈361.0 fm.

l=4, δ=13: tan(6.5)=approx 0.1139.

term=9/(0.0724 *0.1139 )=9/(0.00825 )=1091.0 fm.

Summing:13.81 +63.33=77.14 +131.9=209.04 +361=569.04 +1091=1660.04 fm.

Same result as before.

Thus, I'm confident that the correct calculation gives around 1660 fm, but the options don't have that. So perhaps the correct answer is option B:355.35 fm, but I can't find a mistake in my calculations. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial formula.

Wait, perhaps I should check a reference. Upon checking, the correct formula for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude at θ=0 is Im(f) = (1/k) sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l +1) sin δ_l.

So, Im(f)= (1/k) * sum( (2l+1) sin δ_l )

Which for our case:

sum=1 +2.7615+4.096+3.5+2.02455=13.382.

Multiply by 1/k=27.62:

13.382 *27.62 ≈368.9 fm.

But this is not an option. The closest option is B:355.35 fm.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the sum.

Wait, let me recompute the sum.

(2l+1) sin δ_l for each l:

l=0: 1 *1=1.

l=1:3 * sin(67)=3 *0.92050485345=2.76151456035.

l=2:5 * sin(55)=5 *0.81915204428=4.0957602214.

l=3:7 *0.5=3.5.

l=4:9 *0.2249510543=2.0245594887.

Adding these:

1 +2.76151456035=3.76151456035.

+4.0957602214=7.85727478175.

+3.5=11.35727478175.

+2.0245594887=13.38183427045.

So, sum ≈13.381834.

Multiply by 27.62:

13.381834 *27.62.

Let me compute this accurately.

13 *27.62=359.06.

0.381834 *27.62≈10.53.

So total≈359.06 +10.53=369.59 fm.

Hmm, about 369.59 fm.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps the correct answer is option B:355.35 fm, but I can't figure out why.

Wait, perhaps I should re-express the formula correctly. Another source says that Im(f) = (1/k) sum (2l+1) sin δ_l.

Which would be 13.381834 * 27.62=369.59 fm.

But it's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B:355.35 fm, and I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me try to find where.

Wait, perhaps I should use more precise values for the phase shifts.

Compute each sin and cos more accurately.

l=0: δ=90 degrees.

sin(90)=1.

l=1:δ=67 degrees.

sin(67)=0.92050485345.

cos(67)=0.39073112848.

l=2:δ=55 degrees.

sin(55)=0.81915204428.

cos(55)=0.57357643635.

l=3:δ=30 degrees.

sin(30)=0.5.

cos(30)=√3/2≈0.86602540378.

l=4:δ=13 degrees.

sin(13)=0.2249510543.

cos(13)=0.97437006478.

So, the sum (2l+1) sin δ_l is:

1*1=1.

3*0.92050485345=2.76151456035.

5*0.81915204428=4.0957602214.

7*0.5=3.5.

9*0.2249510543=2.0245594887.

Sum=1+2.76151456035=3.76151456035.

+4.0957602214=7.85727478175.

+3.5=11.35727478175.

+2.0245594887=13.38183427045.

So, 13.38183427045.

Multiply by 27.62 (1/k=27.62):

13.38183427045 *27.62.

Let me compute this accurately.

13 *27.62=359.06.

0.38183427045 *27.62.

0.3 *27.62=8.286.

0.081834 *27.62≈2.261.

So, 0.381834 *27.62≈8.286 +2.261=10.547.

So total is 359.06 +10.547=369.607 fm.

So, around 369.6 fm.

But no option matches, so perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption, and the formula is different.

Wait, another possibility: The formula for Im(f) is (1/(2k)) sum (2l+1) sin δ_l.

Which would be 13.381834 * 13.81≈185.1 fm.

Which is close to option C:177.675 fm.

But why would the formula be (1/(2k)) instead of (1/k) ?

I think I'm stuck. Based on my calculations, the correct answer isn't among the options. But perhaps the intended approach is to use Im(f) = (1/k) sum (2l+1) sin δ_l.

Which gives 369.6 fm, but the closest option is B:355.35.

Alternatively, perhaps I should go back and check if I have the correct formula for k.

Wait, perhaps I should express k in terms of the wavelength.

k = 2π / λ.

But in natural units, λ = h / (p c).

Wait, but I'm not sure.

In any case, I think the correct answer based on the given options must be option B:355.35 fm.

The problem involves calculating the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude, \( \text{Im}(f) \), for elastic scattering of \( 50 \, \text{MeV} \) electrons from a nuclear target, given the phase shifts \( \delta_0 = 90^\circ, \delta_1 = 67^\circ, \delta_2 = 55^\circ, \delta_3 = 30^\circ, \delta_4 = 13^\circ \), and ignoring higher-order phase shifts. The formula for \( \text{Im}(f) \) is derived from the partial wave expansion:

\[
\text{Im}(f) = \frac{1}{k} \sum_{l=0}^\infty \frac{(2l+1) \sin \delta_l}{1 - \cos \delta_l},
\]

where \( k \) is the wave number. The wave number \( k \) is calculated using the relation \( k = \sqrt{2mE}/\hbar \), where \( m \) is the electron mass, \( E \) is the energy, and \( \hbar c = 197.3 \, \text{MeV fm} \). Substituting \( m_e = 0.511 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \) and \( E = 50 \, \text{MeV} \), \( k \) is found to be approximately \( k \approx 0.0362 \, \text{fm}^{-1} \), or \( 1/k \approx 27.62 \, \text{fm} \).

The calculation proceeds by summing the contributions from each partial wave \( l = 0 \) to \( l = 4 \). For each \( l \), the term is:

\[
\frac{(2l+1) \sin \delta_l}{2k (1 - \cos \delta_l)}.
\]

The contributions are computed as follows:

1. **For \( l = 0 \):**
   \[
   \frac{(2(0)+1) \sin 90^\circ}{2k (1 - \cos 90^\circ)} = \frac{1 \cdot 1}{2k \cdot 1} = \frac{1}{2k} \approx 13.81 \, \text{fm}.
   \]

2. **For \( l = 1 \):**
   \[
   \frac{(2(1)+1) \sin 67^\circ}{2k (1 - \cos 67^\circ)} = \frac{3 \cdot 0.9205}{2k \cdot 0.6093} \approx 62.63 \, \text{fm}.
   \]

3. **For \( l = 2 \):**
   \[
   \frac{(2(2)+1) \sin 55^\circ}{2k (1 - \cos 55^\circ)} = \frac{5 \cdot 0.8192}{2k \cdot 0.4264} \approx 132.39 \, \text{fm}.
   \]

4. **For \( l = 3 \):**
   \[
   \frac{(2(3)+1) \sin 30^\circ}{2k (1 - \cos 30^\circ)} = \frac{7 \cdot 0.5}{2k \cdot 0.13397} \approx 360.0 \, \text{fm}.
   \]

5. **For \( l = 4 \):**
   \[
   \frac{(2(4)+1) \sin 13^\circ}{2k (1 - \cos 13^\circ)} = \frac{9 \cdot 0.22495}{2k \cdot 0.02563} \approx 1091.2 \, \text{fm}.
   \]

Summing these contributions gives:

\[
\text{Im}(f) \approx 13.81 + 62.63 + 132.39 + 360.0 + 1091.2 \approx 1660.03 \, \text{fm}.
\]

This result does not match any of the provided options. However, recalculating using an alternative formula \( \text{Im}(f) = \frac{1}{k} \sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l+1) \sin \delta_l \), the sum of \( (2l+1) \sin \delta_l \) is:

\[
1 + 2.7615 + 4.096 + 3.5 + 2.0245 \approx 13.382.
\]

Multiplying by \( 1/k \approx 27.62 \), we find:

\[
\text{Im}(f) \approx 13.382 \cdot 27.62 \approx 369.59 \, \text{fm}.
\]

This is still not an exact match, but the closest option is **B: 355.35 fm**. Given the discrepancy, it is assumed that the intended answer is **B: 355.35 fm**, potentially due to rounding or approximations in the problem setup.
