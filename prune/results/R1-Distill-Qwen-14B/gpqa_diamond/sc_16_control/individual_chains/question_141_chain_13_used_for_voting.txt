Okay, let me try to figure out this organic chemistry problem. So, the question is about treating 1-bromobenzene-2-d with NaNH2 in a condensed ammonia solvent. Hmm, I remember that NaNH2 is a strong base, often used in dehydrohalogenation reactions, especially in aromatic substitution.

Wait, 1-bromobenzene-2-d. Oh wait, I think that's a typo. Maybe it's 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene? Because 1-bromobenzene-2-d doesn't make much sense. Or perhaps it's 1-bromo-2,4-dichlorobenzene? No, the name in the question is 1-bromobenzene-2-d, which probably refers to a benzene ring with a bromine at position 1 and a deuterium at position 2. Hmm, but I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, maybe it's a benzene with substituents at positions 1 and 2. Wait, perhaps it's 1-bromo-2-methylbenzene, but the 'd' part is confusing me. Maybe it's 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene? Or perhaps the 'd' is a typo for something else. Alternatively, maybe the structure is 1-bromo-2-dimethylamino benzene? Wait, I think I'm overcomplicating it.

Wait, perhaps the structure is 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene. So positions 1 is Br, 2 and 4 are methyl groups. Or maybe it's 1-bromo-2-dimethylaminobenzene. Hmm, but I'm not sure. The exact structure will determine the possible products.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is 1-bromo-2,4-dichlorobenzene, but I'm not certain. Wait, the question says 1-bromobenzene-2-d. Oh wait, maybe it's 1-bromo-2-dimethylbenzene. Alternatively, maybe it's 1-bromo-2-methylbenzene, also known as bromomethylbenzene. But the 'd' is throwing me off. Alternatively, perhaps it's 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene, which would have Br in position 1, methyl groups in positions 2 and 4.

Assuming that, the reaction is with NaNH2 in ammonia. NaNH2 is a strong base and a good nucleophile. In aromatic substitution, especially when dealing with dehalogenation or elimination, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation to form a ring with a double bond, like a benzene ring undergoing elimination to form a diene or aromatic ring expansion. Wait, but benzene is already a six-membered ring with three double bonds. So elimination of H and Br would lead to forming another ring structure.

Wait, another possibility is that the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation, which would form a ring with a double bond. For example, if the starting material is a bromobenzene with substituents that allow for the formation of a new double bond upon elimination.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is actually 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene. So, the structure is benzene with Br at position 1, methyl groups at 2 and 4. When NaNH2 is used, which is a strong base, it could abstract a proton adjacent to the Br, leading to elimination of HBr and formation of a new double bond.

So, the Br is at position 1. The adjacent positions are 2 and 6. But in this structure, position 2 has a methyl group. Wait, methyl groups are ortho, meta, para. So, the adjacent positions to Br (position 1) would be positions 2 and 6. But in our starting material, position 2 is a methyl group. So, can the base abstract a hydrogen from position 2? No, because it's a methyl group! So, the only available position is position 6. But wait, the starting material is 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene, so position 2 is CH3, position 4 is CH3, and position 1 is Br.

So, positions adjacent to Br are 2 and 6. Position 2 has a methyl, so no H to abstract. So, the only possible position is position 6. But wait, position 6 is a CH group? No, in benzene, each position is a CH. But if it's 2 and 4 that are substituted, then position 6 is CH. So, the base (NH2-) could abstract a hydrogen from position 6, leading to elimination of Br- and formation of a new double bond between positions 1 and 2.

Wait, but position 2 is a methyl. So, the elimination would be between position 1 (Br) and position 6 (H). So, elimination would form a double bond between positions 1 and 2, but wait, position 2 is a methyl group. That might not be possible. Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts a hydrogen from position 6, leading to the formation of a double bond between positions 5 and 6, but that doesn't involve the Br.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let's think again. The starting compound is 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene. Structure: Br is at position 1, methyl at 2 and 4.

In such a structure, when treated with a strong base like NaNH2 in ammonia (a dehydrohalogenation condition), the base would abstract a hydrogen that's adjacent to the bromine, leading to the formation of a double bond.

So, positions adjacent to Br (position 1) are positions 2 and 6. Position 2 has a methyl group, so no H for abstraction. So, can the base abstract from position 6? Position 6 is a CH group. So, yes.

If the base abstracts a hydrogen from position 6, then elimination of Br and H would form a new double bond between position 1 and 2. Wait, but position 2 has a methyl, so that would form a double bond between 1 and 6? Wait, no. Let me visualize the benzene ring.

Positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 in order. So, if the Br is at 1, and the methyl groups are at 2 and 4, then the adjacent positions to Br are 2 and 6. Position 2 is CH3, so no H. Position 6 is CH. So, the base can abstract a H from position 6, which is adjacent to Br.

Elimination would result in the formation of a double bond between positions 1 and 6. Wait, but that's impossible because that would require a double bond between adjacent carbons. Alternatively, elimination would form a double bond between 1 and 2 (but position 2 is a methyl, so perhaps that's not feasible), or between 1 and 6.

Wait, perhaps elimination would form a double bond between positions 2 and 3? No, because the H is abstracted from position 6. Let me think about the mechanism.

In the E2 mechanism, the base abstracts a proton that's anti-periplanar to the leaving group (Br). So, the leaving group is at position 1. The H is abstracted from position 6, which is adjacent. So, the double bond would form between positions 1 and 6. But benzene is a six-membered ring, so forming a double bond between 1 and 6 would actually create a larger ring? Wait, no, in benzene, each bond is a single bond with partial double bonds. If we eliminate Br from position 1 and H from 6, the double bond would form between C1 and C2? Wait, but position 2 is a methyl.

Alternatively, perhaps elimination leads to forming a new structure where the ring becomes larger. Wait, benzene is a six-membered ring. Removing Br and adding a double bond would not change that. Alternatively, perhaps the ring becomes a five-membered ring? That doesn't make sense.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the reaction is not elimination but substitution. But NaNH2 is a strong base, more suited for elimination. Substitution under such conditions is less likely because it's a strong base, not a good nucleophilic substitution condition.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation, leading to the formation of an alkyne? No, that usually requires more specific conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to the formation of a benzene ring with a double bond. Wait, but benzene already has conjugated double bonds. So maybe the elimination is intramolecular, forming a new ring.

Wait, perhaps the ring expansion. For example, elimination could form a new double bond elsewhere, but I'm not seeing it.

Wait, maybe the structure is different. Maybe it's not 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene, but 1-bromo-2-methylbenzene. Then the adjacent H would be at position 6. So, elimination would form a double bond between position 1 and 2, which is a methyl group. Hmm, that doesn't make sense because a double bond can't be between C1 and C2 if C2 is a methyl.

Wait, perhaps elimination leads to a new compound where the ring becomes smaller. For example, if the Br and a methyl group are adjacent, elimination could form a new ring. But in this case, the structure is 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene, so elimination from position 6 would form a double bond between 1 and 6, creating a new structure. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction forms a benzannulation product. But I'm not recalling the exact mechanisms.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic aromatic substitution. But NaNH2 is a strong base, which might deprotonate something. Wait, but the ring in 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene is already activated because of the methyl groups (ortho/para directors). But in this case, it's a bromine, which is a meta director, but perhaps the methyl groups are activating.

Wait, but NaNH2 is used in dehydrohalogenation. So elimination would form a new double bond.

Wait, perhaps the product would be 1,2-dimethyl-1,3-butadienyl benzene? No, that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the elimination leads to a diene structure. Let me think: if the base abstracts a hydrogen from position 6, and the Br leaves, forming a double bond between position 1 and position 2. But position 2 is a methyl group, so that might not be possible.

Wait, maybe it's a different position. Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts a hydrogen from position 3, which is meta to Br. But that's not adjacent, so E2 wouldn't work. E2 requires the H and leaving group to be anti-periplanar, which is only possible in adjacent positions.

Wait, maybe the starting material has substituents in such a way that after elimination, the ring becomes a bicyclic structure. Hmm, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed as expected, and only one product is formed. But that seems unlikely.

Wait, let's think about the possible products. If the base abstracts a hydrogen from position 6, then elimination would form a double bond between position 1 and 2. But position 2 is a methyl, so that's not possible. Alternatively, perhaps the double bond forms between position 6 and position 5. But position 5 is a hydrogen.

Wait, maybe I should draw this out mentally. Let's imagine the benzene ring with Br at position 1, methyl at 2 and 4. So the structure is:

Positions 1 (Br), 2 (CH3), 3 (H), 4 (CH3), 5 (H), 6 (H).

Base abstracts H from position 6, leading to elimination of Br and formation of a double bond between C1 and C6. But in a benzene ring, each carbon is bonded to two adjacent carbons. So forming a double bond between C1 and C6 would create a double bond between adjacent carbons, which would change the ring structure.

Wait a minute, perhaps this elimination leads to the formation of a cyclopentadienyl ring? Or maybe a smaller ring, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the elimination would form a new compound where the benzene ring becomes a five-membered ring. Wait, that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, perhaps elimination leads to the formation of a new substituent. For example, if the Br is at position 1 and the H is at position 6, elimination would form a new double bond between C1 and C6, making the ring have a double bond there. But benzene already has double bonds in all positions, so maybe the structure becomes a different aromatic compound.

Wait, perhaps the product is 2,4-dimethylbenzene without the Br, but that's just substitution, which I don't think is the case here.

Alternatively, maybe the product is 1,2-dimethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene or something like that. I'm getting a bit stuck.

Wait, maybe I need to think about the possible positions where elimination can occur. Since the Br is at position 1, and the adjacent positions are 2 and 6, but position 2 is a methyl, the only available position is 6. So elimination can only occur at position 6. Thus, only one product is formed. But wait, maybe there are other possibilities.

Wait, another possibility: if the structure is 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene, perhaps the base can abstract a hydrogen from position 3 or position 5, but those are not adjacent to the Br. So E2 mechanism requires the H and Br to be on adjacent carbons and anti-periplanar. So only positions 2 and 6 are possible. Since position 2 is a methyl, the only H available is at position 6. So elimination would occur, leading to only one product. But wait, is that the case?

Wait, but NaNH2 in ammonia is a strong base. If the reaction leads to elimination, the product would have a double bond where the Br was. So, in this case, elimination would form a double bond between C1 and C2? But C2 is a methyl, which can't form a double bond. So perhaps elimination isn't possible, and the reaction doesn't proceed. But that seems unlikely because the question presents options.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material isn't as I thought. Maybe the structure is 1-bromo-2-methylbenzene, which is bromobenzene with a methyl group at position 2. Then, the adjacent positions are 1 (Br), 2 (CH3), and 6.

Wait, no. Let me think again. If the structure is 1-bromo-2-methylbenzene, then the Br is at position 1, methyl at 2. The adjacent positions to Br are 2 (CH3) and 6 (CH). So, the base could abstract H from position 6, leading to elimination of Br and formation of a double bond between 1 and 6. But that would mean a new structure where a double bond is formed between 1 and 6, which are adjacent. How would that affect the ring?

Wait, perhaps the double bond would be between 1 and 2. But position 2 is a methyl, so that's not possible. Alternatively, elimination leads to a ring contraction. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is 1,2-dimethylbenzene (xylene) without the Br, but that would be substitution, which isn't likely here because NaNH2 is a base, not a nucleophile in this condition.

Wait, maybe the reaction leads to the formation of a new ring. For example, elimination of H and Br from adjacent positions forms a new double bond, making the ring larger? But benzene is already a six-membered ring, so making it seven-membered seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed because there's no available H adjacent to Br. But if the starting material is 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene, then position 2 is CH3 and position 6 is CH, so the base can abstract H from position 6. Then elimination would form a double bond between 1 and 6. But I'm not sure about the product structure.

Wait, maybe the product is 1,2-dimethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a benzene ring with a double bond, but that's already the case. So perhaps the reaction doesn't change the aromaticity but forms a new substituent.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction forms a new substituent via elimination, such as forming a new ring structure. But I'm not entirely certain.

Wait, perhaps the answer is that only one product is formed. But looking at the options, option B is 1. So maybe the base can abstract only one H, leading to a single product.

Alternatively, perhaps there are two possible positions for elimination, but in this case, only one is possible because the other is a methyl group.

Wait, let me think again. If the starting material is 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene, the only available H adjacent to Br is at position 6 (since position 2 is a methyl). So the base abstracts H from position 6, leading to elimination of Br and formation of a double bond between C1 and C6. But in a benzene ring, each C is bonded to two others. So forming a double bond between C1 and C6 would create a new structure, perhaps a di-substituted benzene with a double bond. But I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the product would have a double bond between C1 and C2, but since C2 is a methyl, that's not possible. So perhaps the elimination leads to forming a new ring, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed because there's no possible elimination, but that can't be right because the question states that products are formed.

Alternatively, maybe the starting material allows for two different elimination products. For example, if the H could be abstracted from position 6 or position 2 (if possible). But position 2 is a methyl, so no. So only one H is available, leading to one product.

Wait, maybe there are two possible products because of the possibility of forming either a cis or trans double bond, but I don't think that's the case here. Or perhaps the stereoisomerism isn't a factor here because the starting material is symmetrical.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to the formation of a new ring, such as a bicyclic structure, which could have multiple products. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction forms a diene, which could have different regiochemistry, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps another approach: the number of possible products depends on the number of unique positions where elimination can occur. If only one H is available adjacent to Br, then only one product forms.

So, the answer would be 1 product, which is option B.

But wait, I'm not entirely confident. Let me think again. If the starting material is 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene, elimination would occur only once, leading to one product. So the number of possible products is 1.

So the correct answer would be option B) 1.

The reaction involves treating 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene with NaNH₂ in a condensed ammonia solvent. NaNH₂ is a strong base, commonly used for dehydrohalogenation reactions. In this case, the bromine atom at position 1 is the leaving group, and the base abstracts a proton (H) from a position adjacent to the bromine to facilitate elimination.

The structure of 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene has a bromine atom at position 1, methyl groups at positions 2 and 4, and hydrogens at positions 3, 5, and 6. For elimination to occur via the E2 mechanism, the hydrogen must be adjacent to the bromine and anti-periplanar to it. The adjacent positions to the bromine are positions 2 and 6. However, position 2 is occupied by a methyl group, which does not have a hydrogen available for abstraction. Therefore, the only viable position for hydrogen abstraction is position 6.

When the base abstracts a hydrogen from position 6, elimination of the bromine atom occurs, forming a double bond between positions 1 and 6. This results in a single product, as there is only one possible site for elimination in this molecule. There are no other positions available for elimination due to the substitution pattern of the molecule.

Thus, the reaction produces only one organic product.
