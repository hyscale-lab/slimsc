Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about angular momentum. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me think through it step by step.

The question is about finding the eigenvalue and eigenvectors of the operator Ay. The setup is that Ay is given by c multiplied by the matrix S. Oh wait, c is h/(4π), right? And S is a 2x2 matrix. The first row of S is (0, -i), and the second row is (i, 0). 

First, I remember that the intrinsic angular momentum operator components satisfy the commutation relations similar to angular momentum in classical mechanics. But wait, since this is about the Y-component, I'm thinking about how the matrix S looks. Oh, right, I've seen matrices for spin operators before. For spin-½ particles, the Pauli matrices are used. But wait, the spin matrices are usually 2x2, so that matches.

Wait, the S matrix here is given as:
Row 1: 0  -i
Row 2: i  0

Wait a second, isn't that the structure of the Pauli Y matrix multiplied by something? The Pauli Y matrix is:
[0, -i]
[i, 0]

So S is exactly the Pauli Y matrix, sigma_y. So S = sigma_y.

But wait, the operator Ay is c multiplied by S. So Ay = c * sigma_y. And c is h/(4π). So I should write Ay as (h/(4π)) * sigma_y.

But wait, in quantum mechanics, the spin component operators S_i are usually (h/(2π)) times the Pauli matrices. Because I remember that S_x = (h/2π) * sigma_x, and similar for S_y and S_z. So in that case, c here is h/(4π) which is half of that factor. So maybe I'm dealing with a different scaling.

Wait, but the problem says that Ay = c * S, so I'll just work with that as given. My goal is to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay.

So, to find the eigenvalues, I need to solve the characteristic equation det(Ay - a I) = 0. Since Ay is a 2x2 matrix, this should be manageable.

First, let's write down the matrix Ay explicitly. Since S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]], and c is h/(4π), so each element of S is multiplied by c.

So, Ay = [ [0 * c, (-i)*c], [i*c, 0] ].

So, Ay is:
[ 0, -i*(h/(4π)) ]
[ i*(h/(4π)), 0 ]

So, to find the eigenvalues a, we set up the equation:

det( Ay - a I ) = 0

Which expands to:
det( [ -a   -i*(h/(4π)) ]
      [ i*(h/(4π))  -a ]) = 0

The determinant is (-a)(-a) - [ (-i h/(4π)) * (i h/(4π)) ) ]

Let me compute each part:

The diagonal terms give a^2.

The off-diagonal terms: (-i h/(4π)) * (i h/(4π)) = (-i)(i) * (h/(4π))^2.

Hmm, (-i)(i) is (-i^2) which is -(-1) = 1.

Because i * i is i² = -1, so (-i)*i is -i² = 1.

Wait, let me compute that again. (-i) multiplied by i is (-i^2) which is -(-1) = 1.

So the off-diagonal product is 1 * (h/(4π))^2.

So the determinant is a^2 - (h/(4π))^2 = 0.

So, a^2 = (h/(4π))^2 → a = ± h/(4π).

Wait, that's the eigenvalues. So the eigenvalues are a = h/(4π) and a = -h/(4π).

So the possible eigenvalues are plus and minus h/(4π).

Wait, but the options given in the choices involve different values, right? Let me look at the options.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Im part is ±2πh, real part ±h/(4π). That doesn't seem right because the eigenvalues are real here. Because Ay is a Hermitian operator? Wait, is Ay Hermitian?

Wait, let me check: The matrix Ay is (h/(4π)) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. The conjugate transpose of S would be [[0, i], [-i, 0]], right? Because the conjugate of -i is i. So the hermitian of S is [[0, i], [-i, 0]]. Comparing to S, which is [[0, -i], [i, 0]], so the transpose would be [[0, i], [-i, 0]], which is the same as the hermitian. So S is Hermitian? Wait, no. Wait, S is actually equal to its conjugate transpose?

Wait, S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. The conjugate transpose would swap the off-diagonal elements and take their conjugates. So (-i)* becomes i and i becomes -i. So the conjugate transpose is [[0, i], [-i, 0]], which is different from S. So S is not Hermitian. Oh wait, but I thought sigma matrices are Hermitian. Maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, Pauli matrices are Hermitian. Let me check sigma_y. Sigma_y is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. Its conjugate transpose would be [[0, i], [-i, 0]], which is not the same as sigma_y. So that's a problem. Wait, but wait no, sigma_y is equal to its conjugate transpose?

Wait, no, wait, sigma_y is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. The conjugate transpose would be [[0, i], [-i, 0]]. Hmm, which is the same as sigma_y if you swap the positions of i and -i, which would require that i = -i, which isn't true. So sigma_y is not Hermitian? That can't be right because I remember Pauli matrices are Hermitian.

Wait, maybe I messed up the definition. Let me recheck. The Pauli Y matrix is:

σ_y = [[0, -i],
        [i, 0]]

Wait, actually, the Pauli matrices are all Hermitian. So σ_y should be equal to its conjugate transpose.

Hmm, let me compute its conjugate transpose. The (1,2) element is -i; its conjugate is i. The (2,1) element is i; its conjugate is -i.

So the conjugate transpose of σ_y is:

[[0, i],
 [-i, 0]]

Which is not the same as σ_y. But wait, sigma_y is equal to its negative transpose? Because:

σ_y^dagger = [[0, i], [-i, 0]] which is the same as -σ_y.

Because σ_y is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So σ_y^dagger = [[0, i], [-i, 0]] which is equal to [[0, -(-i)], [-i, 0]] which is the same as -σ_y? Because σ_y^dagger = -σ_y.

Wait, so σ_y is anti-Hermitian? Or maybe I'm getting this wrong. Wait, anti-Hermitian means σ_y^dagger = -σ_y. Oh wait, that's true here. So if σ_y is anti-Hermitian, then c σ_y would be anti-Hermitian if c is real.

Wait, but in our case, c is h/(4π), which is real. So Ay = c σ_y is anti-Hermitian. Because (c σ_y)^dagger = c^* σ_y^dagger = c (-σ_y) = -c σ_y. So Ay is anti-Hermitian.

Wait, but in quantum mechanics, observables are represented by Hermitian operators. So if Ay is anti-Hermitian, then it's not an observable. But the question says it's the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum. Oh, but wait, the intrinsic angular momentum is given in terms of spin matrices. So normally, the spin operator S^y would be (h/(2π)) σ_y / 2? Wait, maybe I'm mixing things up.

Wait, perhaps I should move on. Let's compute the eigenvalues again. We found that the eigenvalues are a = ± (h/(4π)).

Now looking at the options, let's see the options.

Option B: The eigenvalues have imaginary parts ±1/2 and real parts ±1. No, since our eigenvalues are real, so the imaginary parts are zero. So option B can't be correct.

Option A: The imaginary parts are ±2πh and real parts ±h/(4π). No, because the eigenvalues are real, so the imaginary parts should be zero. So option A is also incorrect.

Wait, so the eigenvalues are a = ± h/(4π), which are real. So the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues are zero. So none of the options A or B talk about that. So maybe the correct option is either C or D.

Looking at option C: The eigenfunctions φ can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. Hmm. Let me think. Well, for angular momentum, the eigenfunctions of a component (like Ay) are not eigenfunctions of another component (like Az), because of the commutation relations. So if φ is an eigenstate of Ay, then it should not be an eigenstate of Az, because [Ay, Az] = iħ something. But wait, since this is spin, perhaps more accurately, the square of the angular momentum is an operator that commutes with any component. Because L² commutes with Lx, Ly, Lz.

Wait, but in this case, we're dealing with spin, so A^2 is the square of the angular momentum operator. So the eigenfunctions of Ay would also be eigenfunctions of A², because A² commutes with Ay. So if φ is an eigenfunction of Ay, then it's also an eigenfunction of A². So option C says that φ can be an eigenfunction of A², which is correct. But it also says it's not an eigenfunction of Az. That's also correct because [Ay, Az] = iħ something, so they don't share eigenfunctions. So option C might be correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of Ay. Hmm, the eigenfunctions of Ay form a basis for the space on which Ay acts. Since Ay is 2x2, the eigenvectors would form a basis for C². So φ are the basis functions of Ay. Well, that's a bit ambiguous. The basis for the operator? Or the basis for the vector space? I think any basis is fine, but the eigenvectors form an orthogonal basis. So I'm not sure about option D.

Wait, let me think again. Option C says the eigenfunction of Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A^2, but not of Az. Since A^2 commutes with Ay, their eigenfunctions can be shared. So yes, the eigenfunctions of Ay are also eigenfunctions of A². So C is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of Ay. Well, the eigenvectors of Ay form a basis. Any Hermitian operator's eigenvectors (if they are complete) form a basis. But since Ay is anti-Hermitian, as I thought earlier, its eigenvalues are imaginary? Wait no, earlier calculation suggests eigenvalues are real. Wait, no, wait, because the determinant equation gave a^2 = (h/(4π))² → a= ± h/(4π), which are real. So Ay has real eigenvalues, and thus its eigenvectors are real, or maybe orthogonal.

Wait, but earlier I thought Ay is anti-Hermitian, so eigenvalues are imaginary. But in this case, the eigenvalues are real. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in determining whether Ay is Hermitian or not.

Wait, let's check again. Ay is c * S, where c is h/(4π) and S is [[0,-i],[i,0]]. So S is the same as the Pauli sigma_y matrix, which I thought was anti-Hermitian because sigma_y^dagger = - sigma_y. So Ay would be (h/(4π)) sigma_y, which would be anti-Hermitian, because (Ay)^dagger = (h/(4π)) sigma_y^dagger = (h/(4π)) (- sigma_y) = - Ay.

But anti-Hermitian operators have eigenvalues that are purely imaginary. Hmm, but earlier calculation gave real eigenvalues. So there's a contradiction here. Did I make a mistake in the determinant calculation?

Wait, perhaps I should double-check the determinant calculation.

Ay is [[0, -i c], [i c, 0]], where c = h/(4π).

The matrix for (Ay - a I) is [[-a, -i c], [i c, -a]].

The determinant is (-a)(-a) - (-i c)(i c) = a² - [ (-i c)(i c) ]

Let me compute (-i c)(i c):

(-i) * i = (-i^2) = 1. Because i * i is -1, so (-i) * i is -i² = -(-1) =1.

So (-i c)(i c) = (1) * c².

So determinant is a² - c² = 0 → a² = c² → a= ± c.

So a = ± (h/(4π)).

So the eigenvalues are real. But wait, if Ay is anti-Hermitian, its eigenvalues should be imaginary. This is confusing. There's a mistake here.

Wait, maybe I messed up the Hermiticity.

Wait, if Ay is anti-Hermitian, then its eigenvalues should be imaginary. But the determinant suggests real eigenvalues. So this is a contradiction, which means I must have made a mistake in assuming Ay is anti-Hermitian.

Wait, let me recompute Ay's Hermiticity.

Ay = c * S, where S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]].

So S^dagger is [[0, i], [-i, 0]]. So S^dagger = [[0, i], [-i, 0]].

What is S^dagger compared to S?

S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]

So S^dagger is [[0, i], [-i, 0]]

Which is the same as -S, because -S is [[0, i], [-i, 0]]

So S^dagger = -S → S is anti-Hermitian.

So Ay = c S → Ay^dagger = c^* (-S) = c (-S) since c is real.

So Ay^dagger = - Ay.

So Ay is anti-Hermitian, which implies that its eigenvalues are purely imaginary.

Wait, earlier calculation said the eigenvalues are real. So that can't be right. So where's the error?

Ah, wait. Let's recompute the determinant step. Because if the matrix is anti-Hermitian, then the determinant should give a negative of the square of the eigenvalues.

Wait, no, the determinant of an anti-Hermitian matrix is the product of its eigenvalues. For 2x2, determinant is (a)(b) where a and b are eigenvalues, which are imaginary. But the product would be positive real if they're conjugate pairs. Hmm.

Wait, but let's recalculate the determinant part. Maybe I made a mistake in the previous calculation.

Wait, (Ay - a I) is [[-a, -i c], [i c, -a]].

The determinant is (-a)(-a) - ( (-i c)(i c) )

Compute each term:

(-i c)(i c) = (-i)(i) c^2 = (-i^2) c^2 = (-(-1)) c^2 = c^2.

So determinant is a² - (c²) = 0 → a² = c².

So a = ± c → ± (h/(4π)).

But this gives real eigenvalues. But if Ay is anti-Hermitian, eigenvalues should be imaginary. So there's a contradiction.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the matrix. Let me write out S again.

Wait, the S matrix is given as Row 1: 0 -i; Row 2: i 0.

Wait, wait a second: S is given as the matrix, but perhaps I got the definition wrong. Because for the Pauli Y matrix, it's [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So the matrix in the problem is indeed the Pauli Y.

But wait, in quantum mechanics, the spin operator S^y is (ħ/2) sigma_y. So in this problem, Ay is c * S, where c is h/(4π). So if S is sigma_y, then c S is (h/(4π)) sigma_y. But the standard spin operator's y-component would be (h/(2π)) sigma_y * (1/2), wait, no, perhaps it's (h/(2π)) times (sigma_y /2). Wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, let me think in terms of dimensions. The angular momentum operator has units of ħ. The Pauli matrices are dimensionless, so when multiplied by ħ, they give the correct units for angular momentum.

So in standard terms, S^y = (ħ/2) sigma_y. So here, Ay = c S, where c is h/(4π) → which is (2 π ħ)/(4 π) )= ħ/2. So c S is (ħ/2) sigma_y, which matches S^y. So Ay is indeed the spin y-component operator. So S^y is Hermitian, because spin components are observables.

Wait, but earlier calculation says S is anti-Hermitian. So this suggests a contradiction. So perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier analysis.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the Hermiticity. Let me compute S^dagger again.

S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. The conjugate transpose would be [[0, i], [-i, 0]]. Comparing to S, which is [[0, -i], [i, 0]], S^dagger is [[0, i], [-i, 0]] which is the same as -S. Because S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]], so -S is [[0, i], [-i, 0]], which matches S^dagger. So S^dagger = - S → S is anti-Hermitian.

But the spin operator S^y should be Hermitian, as it's an observable. So there's a contradiction here.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in defining S. The question says that Ay = c S, and S is given as the matrix with first row (0, -i), second row (i, 0). So perhaps S is actually not Hermitian, which would mean that Ay is not Hermitian either. So the operator Ay is anti-Hermitian, so its eigenvalues would be imaginary.

Hmm, so earlier calculation of a = ± c must be incorrect. Because if Ay is anti-Hermitian, the eigenvalues must be imaginary.

Wait, perhaps I should recompute the eigenvalues considering that Ay is anti-Hermitian.

So let's write the matrix Ay again.

Ay = [[0, -i c], [i c, 0]], with c = h/(4π).

We can write the eigenvalue equation as Ay |φ> = a |φ>.

Since Ay is anti-Hermitian, a should be imaginary, so a = i k, where k is real.

So let me set a = i k and substitute into the equation.

The matrix equation (Ay - a I) |φ> = 0.

So:

[[-i k, -i c], [i c, -i k]] |φ> = 0.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute the eigenvalues correctly.

Write the matrix Ay as [[0, -i c], [i c, 0]].

To find eigenvalues a, we have det(Ay - a I) = 0 → | -a  -i c |
                              |i c  -a | = 0

So determinant is a² - ( (-i c) (i c) ) 

Compute (-i c)(i c) = (-i)(i) c² = (-i²) c² = (1) c² = c².

So determinant equation: a² - c² =0 → a^2 = c² → a = ± c.

But wait, this gives real eigenvalues again. But that's impossible because Ay is anti-Hermitian, which should have imaginary eigenvalues.

So where's the mistake? Oh wait, perhaps I messed up the matrix. Wait, no, earlier steps seem correct.

Wait, perhaps the matrix is Hermitian. Because if I made a mistake in S's Hermiticity.

Wait, maybe S is Hermitian. Let me check again.

S = [[0, -i], [i, 0]]

Conjugate transpose S† is [[0, i], [-i, 0]]

Which is equal to S? No, because S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]

So S† is [[0, i], [-i, 0]] which is equal to the negative of S. So S† = -S → anti-Hermitian.

So S is anti-Hermitian. Then, c S is anti-Hermitian because c is real.

But the eigenvalues came out real, which should not be possible.

Wait, perhaps I should think differently. Maybe I've made a mistake in the determinant calculation because I forgot that the eigenvalues are imaginary.

Wait, another approach: let me set a as i k, and compute the eigenvalues.

Then, the equation becomes a^2 = c^2.

So (i k)^2 = c^2 → -k^2 = c^2 → k^2 = -c^2 → which implies k is imaginary. That can't be, which suggests that the approach is wrong.

Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing. Let me try to find the eigenvectors and see.

Assume that a is real. The eigenvalues are a = ± c.

For a = c, the matrix Ay - c I is:

[[-c, -i c], [i c, -c]]

We can write the equations (-c) x - i c y = 0 and i c x - c y = 0.

From the first equation: -c x - i c y = 0 → x = -i y.

From the second equation: i c x - c y = 0 → i x - y = 0 → y = i x.

Substituting x = -i y into y = i x: y = i (-i y) = (i * -i) y = (1) y → y = y. So any y is allowed, x = -i y.

So the eigenvector is proportional to [ -i, 1 ].

Similarly for a = -c, the matrix Ay + c I:

[[c, -i c], [i c, c]]

Equations: c x - i c y =0 → x = i y.

i c x + c y =0 → i x + y =0 → y = -i x.

Substituting x = i y into y = -i x: y = -i (i y) = -i² y = y → y = y.

So the eigenvector is proportional to [i, 1 ].

Wait, but these are real eigenvalues. So this suggests that the operator has real eigenvalues, which contradicts the fact that it's anti-Hermitian.

But I must be making a mistake here because the eigenvalues of an anti-Hermitian operator should be imaginary.

Alternatively, perhaps the matrix isn't anti-Hermitian. Let me recheck.

Wait, maybe I should compute Ay^dagger and check.

Ay is [[0, -i c], [i c, 0]]

So Ay^dagger would be [[0, i c], [-i c, 0]]

Which is the same as -Ay because Ay is [[0, -i c], [i c, 0]]

So Ay^dagger = [[0, i c], [-i c, 0]] → which is [[0, i c], [-i c, 0]] = - Ay.

So yes, Ay is anti-Hermitian.

But calculation shows real eigenvalues. Which can't be. So perhaps the mistake is in the initial step of the determinant.

Wait, wait, wait. Let me recompute the determinant.

The matrix is [[-a, -i c], [i c, -a]]

The determinant is (-a)(-a) - (-i c)(i c) → a² - [ (-i c)(i c) ]

Compute (-i c)(i c) = (-i)(i) c² = ( -i² ) c² → because i² is -1, so -i² is 1. So (-i)(i) = 1 → so it's (1) c².

So determinant is a² - c² =0 → a² = c² → a=± c.

But this gives real eigenvalues, but operator is anti-Hermitian. So this is a contradiction.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that I'm working in units where h is replaced by something else. Alternatively, perhaps I've misapplied the properties of anti-Hermitian operators.

Wait, according to the properties, for an anti-Hermitian operator A, A^dagger = -A. So its eigenvalues must satisfy λ^* = -λ → which implies that λ is purely imaginary. So if an anti-Hermitian operator has eigenvalues a, then a must be imaginary.

But according to our calculation, the eigenvalues are real. So this suggests that somewhere, the setup is wrong.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that c is not real? No, c= h/(4π) is real.

Alternatively, maybe the matrix S is not anti-Hermitian but Hermitian. Let me think again. If S is Hermitian, then Ay would be Hermitian, and the eigenvalues would be real.

Wait, with the given S matrix, [[0, -i], [i, 0]], let me compute S^dagger.

S^dagger is [[0, i], [-i, 0]], which is equal to - S.

So S^dagger = - S → S is anti-Hermitian.

So Ay = c S is anti-Hermitian.

But the eigenvalues are real, which can't be.

Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing. Maybe I should proceed under the assumption that the eigenvalues are correct as per the calculation, even if it contradicts Hermiticity. Perhaps the problem is intended to have real eigenvalues.

So back to the options. Since the eigenvalues are a = ± h/(4π), which are real, and the options are about the eigenvalues.

Looking back at the options:

Option A: The imaginary parts are ±2πh, real parts ±h/(4π). So this is incorrect because the eigenvalues are real.

Option B: imaginary parts ±1/2, real parts ±1. Also incorrect.

So the correct options must be C or D.

Option C: The eigenfunction of Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A², but not of Az.

Since A² is the square of the angular momentum, it commutes with Ay, so their eigenfunctions can be shared. So yes, the eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenfunctions of A². But they can't be eigenfunctions of Az because of [Ay, Az] = i something, so they don't share eigenvectors. So option C is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. Well, any Hermitian operator's eigenvectors form an orthogonal basis. But in this case, Ay is anti-Hermitian, but the eigenvectors are still a basis for the space. So D could be correct.

Hmm, but option C seems correct because it's about the eigenfunctions being eigenfunctions of A².

So among the options, which statements are correct during the calculation.

Wait, the question is: during the calculation, which statement will you consider to be correct?

So the correct statement is that the eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az. So option C is correct.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator \( A_y \), which is defined as \( A_y = c \cdot S \), where \( c = \frac{h}{4\pi} \) and \( S \) is a 2×2 matrix with the first row \((0, -i)\) and the second row \((i, 0)\). This matrix \( S \) corresponds to the Pauli \( Y \)-matrix, which is anti-Hermitian (\( S^\dagger = -S \)). Since \( c \) is real, \( A_y \) is also anti-Hermitian, meaning its eigenvalues should be purely imaginary.

To find the eigenvalues, the characteristic equation is solved as follows:

\[
\det(A_y - aI) = 0,
\]
where \( A_y = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i c \\ i c & 0 \end{bmatrix} \). Substituting \( a \) into the matrix, the determinant becomes:

\[
\det\begin{bmatrix} -a & -i c \\ i c & -a \end{bmatrix} = (-a)^2 - (-i c)(i c) = a^2 - c^2 = 0.
\]

This gives \( a^2 = c^2 \), so the eigenvalues are \( a = \pm c = \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \). These eigenvalues are real, which contradicts the expectation that anti-Hermitian operators have purely imaginary eigenvalues. This discrepancy suggests a possible issue with the interpretation of the operator's Hermiticity, but the calculation proceeds with the derived eigenvalues.

For the eigenvectors, solving \( (A_y - aI)|\phi\rangle = 0 \) for \( a = \frac{h}{4\pi} \) and \( a = -\frac{h}{4\pi} \) yields the eigenvectors proportional to \(\begin{bmatrix} -i \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}\) and \(\begin{bmatrix} i \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}\), respectively.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Claims the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues are \( \pm 2\pi h \) and the real parts are \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \). This is incorrect because the eigenvalues are entirely real, not complex.

- **Option B**: Claims the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues are \( \pm \frac{1}{2} \) and the real parts are \( \pm 1 \). This is also incorrect because the eigenvalues are \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \), which are real but do not match the given values.

- **Option C**: States that the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) can also be eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \) (the square of the angular momentum operator) but not of \( A_z \) (the \( Z \)-component of angular momentum). This is correct because \( A^2 \) commutes with \( A_y \), allowing shared eigenfunctions, while \( A_y \) and \( A_z \) do not commute, preventing shared eigenfunctions.

- **Option D**: Claims that the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are the basis functions of the matrix operator \( A_y \). While the eigenfunctions form a basis for the vector space, this is a trivial statement and does not provide meaningful insight into the problem.

Thus, the correct statement is **Option C**.

Answer: C
