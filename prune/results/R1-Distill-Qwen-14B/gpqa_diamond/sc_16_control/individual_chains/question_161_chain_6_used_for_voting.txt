Okay, so I'm trying to solve this question about transmission electron microscopes and mean free paths of gas molecules. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that the mean free path (MFP) of a gas molecule is the average distance it travels between collisions. In a vacuum, the MFP is longer because there are fewer molecules to collide with. So, when Mike created a ultra-high vacuum, the MFP λ1 should be quite large, right?

The question says that after creating this vacuum, some gas particles remained. Mike measured the MFP as λ1. But when he started the electron beam, he noticed the MFP became λ2, which is different from λ1. The temperature remained the same, so that shouldn't change the MFP based on thermal factors.

Wait, why would the MFP change when the electron beam is on? Oh, I think the electron beam might be interacting with the gas molecules. Maybe the electrons are causing the gas molecules to ionize or something. If the gas becomes ionized, the charged particles would interact more strongly with the electron beam's electric field. But how does that affect the MFP?

I recall that in a plasma, the mean free path can be different because the particles are charged. If the gas is ionized, the ions and electrons might have shorter mean free paths because they attract or repel each other more. Or wait, maybe the opposite happens. If the electrons are being scattered by the gas, perhaps the gas molecules are more likely to collide with each other when they're charged?

Wait, no. Let me think again. The mean free path is inversely proportional to the number density of the gas. But in this case, the pressure is the same because the pumps are running and the temperature is the same, so the number density shouldn't change, right? So why is the MFP changing?

Oh, wait a second. When the electron beam is on, it's a high-energy beam. The electrons might be exciting the gas molecules, causing them to ionize. So the gas becomes partially ionized, meaning it's a plasma now. In a plasma, the mean free path can be different because the charged particles' behavior changes.

In a plasma, the ions and electrons can have different mean free paths. But how does that affect the overall MFP for scattering purposes? Alternatively, perhaps the electron beam is causing the gas to expand or heat, but the problem says the temperature is the same.

Wait, maybe it's about the increase in electron scattering. The electrons in the beam are being scattered by the gas molecules. So the scattering rate might increase when the beam is on, which would effectively reduce the mean free path of the electrons in the beam. But wait, the question is about the mean free path of the gas molecules, not the electrons.

Wait, no. The question says Mike observed a change in the mean free path of the gas molecules based on electron scattering. So when the beam is on, the gas molecules are being hit by electrons, which might cause them to collide more often. Or perhaps the gas molecules are being more effectively scattered, so they have a shorter mean free path.

Wait, let me think about how the MFP is calculated. The MFP λ is given by λ = 1/(√2 n σ), where n is the number density and σ is the collision cross-section. So if σ increases, λ decreases. But why would σ change? If the gas is ionized, maybe the cross-section changes because the ions have different sizes or charges.

Alternatively, maybe the electron beam provides additional energy to the gas particles, causing them to move faster. But if the temperature is the same, their average kinetic energy shouldn't change. Hmm.

Wait, but when the gas is ionized, the mean free path for ions might be shorter because they experience more Coulombic interactions. So if the gas is ionized, the MFP λ2 would be smaller than λ1 because they're colliding more often. Because the presence of charged particles leads to more frequent collisions, reducing the MFP.

Alternatively, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think about it another way. The initial MFP λ1 is determined without the electron beam, in the ultra-high vacuum. When the beam is turned on, the gas molecules may experience more interactions because the beam's electric field causes them to move or collide more. Or perhaps the electrons in the beam are causing the gas to become ionized, which increases the number of collisions between gas molecules.

Wait, no. If the gas becomes ionized, the free electrons and ions can have different behaviors. But the original MFP was for the neutral gas. If the gas is ionized, the neutral molecules are fewer, so the MFP for neutral molecules would be longer? Or wait, no. Wait, the MFP is for the gas molecules, which are neutral before and maybe not so much after ionization.

Alternatively, maybe the ionized gas molecules (ions) have different collision rates. I'm not entirely sure, but perhaps the MFP for the gas molecules (now ions) would decrease because they have higher cross-sections for collisions due to their charge.

Wait, thinking about the mean free path in a plasma, the MFP can be much shorter than in a neutral gas because the charged particles are more likely to collide. So if the gas becomes ionized, λ2 would be smaller than λ1.

So the answer would be λ2 < λ1, which is option C.

Wait another angle: The presence of the electron beam could cause the gas to be more ionized. So the gas molecules are now ions. The MFP for ions is shorter because they interact more strongly with each other and with the beam. So λ2 would be less than λ1.

Yes, that makes sense. So the correct answer should be option C.

The mean free path (MFP) of gas molecules in a vacuum is determined by factors such as the number density of the gas and the collision cross-section. Initially, Mike created an ultra-high vacuum in the sample compartment, resulting in a mean free path of λ1. However, when the electron beam was turned on, Mike observed a change in the MFP to λ2. The temperature remained constant, so the number density of the gas should not have changed significantly.

The key factor causing the change in MFP is the interaction between the electron beam and the gas molecules. The high-energy electrons in the beam likely ionize the gas molecules, converting them into charged particles (ions and free electrons). In a plasma (ionized gas), the mean free path of charged particles is typically shorter than that of neutral gas molecules due to increased Coulombic interactions and scattering. This ionization increases the collision frequency between particles, effectively reducing the MFP.

Since the gas molecules are now ionized and subject to more frequent collisions, the new mean free path λ2 is smaller than the original λ1. Therefore, the correct conclusion is that λ2 < λ1.

Answer: C
