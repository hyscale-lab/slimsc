Alright, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to think it through. Okay, the question is about finding the value of 'a' in the wave function of a particle. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Hmm, wait, but wave functions usually have to satisfy certain normalization conditions, right? Oh, right! The total probability of finding the particle somewhere must be 1. So I need to normalize the wave function.

Wait, but the wave function given is a complex function. I remember that when a wave function is complex, the probability density is given by the square of the absolute value, which is the wavefunction multiplied by its complex conjugate. Oh, but wait, in this case, the wavefunction is written as (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Let me write that out: ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So the real part is a/sqrt(1+x), and the imaginary part is -0.5. 

Wait a second, that can't be right. Because if it's a stationary state, the time-independent Schrödinger equation's solution should be either real or have a time-dependent exponential factor, but this seems a bit odd because the imaginary part is a constant. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again.

Oh, wait, the wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. That's a function of x, right? So the real part is a/(sqrt(1+x)), and the imaginary part is -0.5. So the wavefunction is ψ(x) = [a/(sqrt(1+x))] + (-0.5)i. 

To find the normalization condition, I need to integrate the absolute square of the wavefunction over all space, which should equal 1. The absolute square is |ψ(x)|² = [Re(ψ)]² + [Im(ψ)]². Because ψ is complex, but here, the real part depends on x and the imaginary part is a constant. 

Wait, but in quantum mechanics, the wavefunction must be normalizable, meaning the integral of |ψ|² dx from x = -infinity to +infinity should be 1. However, in this problem, they've mentioned that when measuring the position, particles were only found between x=1 and x=3. So the wavefunction is zero outside this region? Or maybe the wavefunction doesn't exist outside this region. But according to the given wavefunction, ψ(x) is (a/sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i. So I'm a bit confused. 

Wait, no, the problem says that when measuring, none were found outside x=1 and x=3. So the wavefunction must be zero outside this region. But the given ψ(x) is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Hmm, perhaps I need to consider that the wavefunction is only non-zero between x=1 and x=3. Oh, but the given expression is present where the particle can exist, which is between 1 and 3. So ψ(x)=0 outside that interval. So the integration limits are from x=1 to x=3.

So the normalization condition is the integral from 1 to 3 of |ψ(x)|² dx = 1. Let me compute that. 

|ψ(x)|² = [a/(sqrt(1+x))]^2 + (-0.5)^2, because the real part is a/sqrt(1+x), the imaginary part is -0.5. So when you square the absolute value, it's (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25. 

So the integral becomes integral from 1 to 3 of [a²/(1+x) + 0.25] dx = 1.

Let me compute this integral. 

Integral of a²/(1+x) dx from 1 to 3 is a² * ln(1+x) evaluated from 1 to 3. So that's a² [ln(4) - ln(2)] = a² ln(2). 

Integral of 0.25 dx from 1 to3 is 0.25*(3-1) = 0.5.

So putting it together: a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So a² ln(2) = 0.5 → a² = 0.5 / ln(2). 

What's ln(2)? Approximately 0.6931. So 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213. So a² ≈ 0.7213 → a ≈ sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849. 

Looking at the options, option B is 0.85 which is close. Hmm, let me compute more accurately. Let's calculate 0.5 / ln(2):

ln(2) ≈ 0.69314718056

0.5 / 0.69314718056 = approximately 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.72134752044.

Then take the square root: sqrt(0.72134752044) ≈ 0.8493. So 0.8493 is approximately 0.85, which is option B.

Wait, but wait a second. The wave function is given as ψ(x)= (a/sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i. But in quantum mechanics, the wave function shouldn't have an imaginary component that's a constant across the domain, right? Because that would change the probability distribution. Because the square of the absolute value is [a²/(1+x)] + (0.25). So the imaginary part is a constant, which contributes to the probability density. That's acceptable, but I just wanted to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the setup.

Wait another thing. Is the wave function correctly given? Because I'm thinking that the wave function being given as (a/sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i might be a typo. But according to the question, that's the function. So I have to proceed with that.

Another point: maybe I made a mistake in the integral's setup. Let me double-check. The normalization integral is the integral from x=1 to x=3 of |ψ(x)|² dx. So |ψ(x)|² is [a²/(1+x)] + (0.5)^2.

Yes, because (a/sqrt(1+x)) is the real part, so its square is a²/(1+x), and the imaginary part is -0.5, so square is 0.25. So the integral is correct.

So the calculation seems right, leading to a≈0.85, which is option B.

To determine the value of \( a \), we start by normalizing the given wave function \( \psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i \). The normalization condition requires that the total probability of finding the particle is 1, which means:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} |\psi(x)|^2 \, dx = 1
\]

The probability density is given by the square of the absolute value of the wave function:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (-0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25
\]

Substituting this into the normalization condition:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) \, dx = 1
\]

This integral can be split into two parts:

1. **Integral of \( \frac{a^2}{1+x} \):**
   \[
   \int_{1}^{3} \frac{a^2}{1+x} \, dx = a^2 \ln(1+x) \Big|_{1}^{3} = a^2 [\ln(4) - \ln(2)] = a^2 \ln(2)
   \]

2. **Integral of \( 0.25 \):**
   \[
   \int_{1}^{3} 0.25 \, dx = 0.25 \cdot (3-1) = 0.5
   \]

Adding these results:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1
\]

Solving for \( a^2 \):

\[
a^2 \ln(2) = 0.5 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}
\]

Using \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \):

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7213 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a \approx \sqrt{0.7213} \approx 0.849
\]

This value is closest to \( 0.85 \), which corresponds to option **B**.
