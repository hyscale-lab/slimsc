Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, let's see. I've studied a bit of relativity, but I'm a bit rusty, so I'll try to work through it step by step.

So the problem states that the two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c, respectively, both in the positive x-direction. The question is asking for the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. The options are A to D.

Wait, wait. When it's about relative speed in relativity, I remember that you can't just subtract the speeds as you would in classical mechanics. Because at high speeds, you need to use the relativistic velocity addition formula. Oh right, the formula is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)). But wait, I think that's for when one is moving at v1 and the other at v2 in the same direction. So in this case, since both are moving in the positive x-direction, the relative speed of the slower one from the perspective of the faster one would be (0.6c - 0.5c) divided by (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)).

Let me compute that. The numerator is 0.1c. The denominator is 1 - (0.3c²)/(c²) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So 0.1c divided by 0.7 is approximately 0.142857c, which is about 0.14c. Hmm, so looking at the options, both C and D have v_rel as 0.14c. So that's one part done.

Now for the total energy. I think each astronaut's energy should be calculated using the relativistic energy formula: E = gamma * m c². Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So for the first astronaut with mass 2m and speed 0.6c: Gamma1 = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25. So energy E1 = 1.25 * 2m * c² = 2.5 mc².

Wait, wait. Wait, no, actually, the formula is E = gamma * m c². So if the mass is 2m, then E1 = gamma1 * (2m) c^2. Yeah, that's correct.

Similarly for the second astronaut, mass 3m, speed 0.5c. Gamma2 = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547. So E2 = gamma2 * 3m c² ≈ 1.1547 * 3m c² ≈ 3.4641 mc².

Adding E1 and E2: 2.5 + 3.4641 = 5.9641 mc². Which is approximately 5.96 mc². So looking at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc², and option D says E=5 mc². So the energy part would match option C.

Wait, but option C's v_rel is 0.14c, which matches what I found earlier. So the correct option would be C.

Wait, but wait. Another thing to think about: the problem says the system's total energy. So we're adding the energies of both astronauts. So that's correct as I did.

So putting it together: v_rel is approximately 0.14c, E is approximately 5.96 mc². So the answer is option C.

To solve the problem, we calculate the relative speed and total energy of the system using relativistic principles.

### Step 1: Relative Speed
The relative speed between two objects moving in the same direction is given by the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \(v_1 = 0.6c\) and \(v_2 = 0.5c\). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} \approx 0.14c
\]

Thus, the relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\).

### Step 2: Total Energy
The total energy of a relativistic object is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2
\]

where \(\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}\).

#### Energy of the first astronaut (mass \(2m\), speed \(0.6c\)):
\[
\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25
\]
\[
E_1 = \gamma_1 (2m) c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5mc^2
\]

#### Energy of the second astronaut (mass \(3m\), speed \(0.5c\)):
\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]
\[
E_2 = \gamma_2 (3m) c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.4641mc^2
\]

#### Total Energy:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5mc^2 + 3.4641mc^2 \approx 5.96mc^2
\]

### Step 3: Matching with Options
From the calculations:
- The relative speed is \(0.14c\).
- The total energy is \(5.96mc^2\).

These values match **Option C**.
