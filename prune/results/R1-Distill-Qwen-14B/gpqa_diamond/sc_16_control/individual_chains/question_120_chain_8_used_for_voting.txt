Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here. Hmm, let's see what it's about. The question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax, and how that changes with the parallax value. The options are various inverse powers of plx, from 1 to 4. 

Wait, I'm a bit rusty on my concepts, but I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, the parallax (usually denoted as 'p') is inversely proportional to the distance to the star. So a star with a larger parallax is closer to us.

The question states that stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. Uniformly distributed probably means that the number density of stars is constant in space, but I should think about how that translates when considering distances, which involve parallax.

Parallax equation: p (in arcseconds) is approximately equal to 1 / distance (in parsecs). So, if a star is at distance d parsecs, p = 1/d. 

Now, the problem is about the number of stars per unit range of p. Let's denote N as the number of stars, and delta_p as a small range in parallax. We're looking for N per delta_p, so N per unit p.

Since the stars are uniformly distributed, their number density (n) is constant. Number density is number per unit volume. So, in a given volume, the number of stars is n times that volume.

But how do we relate this to parallax? Let's think about a thin spherical shell at a distance d from us. The thickness of the shell would be delta_d. The volume of the shell is approximately 4πd² delta_d. So the number of stars in this shell would be n * 4π d² delta_d.

But we need to express this in terms of parallax p. Since p = 1/d, then d = 1/p. So, substituting, the number of stars in the shell is n * 4π (1/p)^2 delta_d. 

But wait, delta_d is the thickness in distance. How does delta_d relate to delta_p? Since p = 1/d, delta_p = derivative of p with respect to d multiplied by delta_d. The derivative dp/dd is -1/d². So delta_p ≈ (1/d²) delta_d. But since d = 1/p, delta_p ≈ p² delta_d. So delta_d = delta_p / p².

Substituting back into the number of stars, N_shell = n *4π (1/p²)² * (delta_p / p²). Wait, wait, no. Let me re-express that.

Wait, the number of stars per unit p is N_per_p. So, the number of stars in a range from p to p + delta_p is N_shell. The shell's volume is 4π d² delta_d. And since delta_p = - (1/d²) delta_d, delta_d = -d² delta_p. But d is 1/p, so delta_d = (1/p²) delta_p.

So, substituting d = 1/p, the volume is 4π (1/p)^2 * (1/p² delta_p) ) =4π (1/p^4) delta_p.

Wait, wait, let's do that step by step. Volume = 4π d² delta_d. But we have delta_d in terms of delta_p.

So, d =1/p. So, delta_d = (delta_p) * (d²) = (delta_p) * (1/p)^2.

So, substituting into the volume: 4π (1/p)^2 * (delta_p / p²) ) =4π delta_p / p^4.

So the number of stars in that shell is n * volume = n * 4π delta_p / p^4.

So, the number of stars per unit p (i.e., per delta_p) is 4π n / p^4. So, N per unit p is proportional to 1/p^4.

Wait, but wait another moment. The number of stars in a shell depends on 1/p^4? So if p increases (stars are farther away), the number per unit p decreases with 1/p^4.

Looking back at the question: It's asking how the number of stars per unit range of plx (p) changes with plx. So it's looking for the dependence of N on p. So N ~ 1/p^4.

Looking at the options, option A is ~1/plx^4. So that's the answer.

Wait, but wait another thing. Sometimes when considering the distribution, it's possible that we're considering all space, but in reality, the number of stars per unit volume is constant. So the initial approach should be correct.

Alternatively, another approach: The number of stars with parallax between p and p + dp is proportional to the volume between p and p + dp, divided by the cube of the scale (maybe).

Alternatively, using the relation between distance and parallax. The volume element in spherical coordinates is 4πr² dr. Since r = 1/p, dr = -1/p² dp. So, substituting, the volume element is 4π (1/p²) dp. Wait, no: r is 1/p, so 4π r² dr = 4π (1/p²) (-1/p² dp) )? Hmm, perhaps I should think in terms of variable substitution.

Wait, let's model it as such: the number of stars with parallax in [p, p + dp]. The corresponding distances are [d, d + dd], where d=1/p. The volume element is 4π d² dd. So, substituting d=1/p, we have 4π (1/p)^2 * dd. Now, express dd in terms of dp.

Since d =1/p, dd= -1/p² dp. So substituting, volume becomes 4π (1/p²) * (-1/p² dp) )= -4π/(p^4) dp.

The negative just indicates that as p increases, d decreases, but for the purpose of counting stars, we take the absolute value. So the number of stars in that parallax range is n * volume, which is n * 4π / p^4 dp.

So the number per unit dp is 4π n / p^4. So the number of stars per unit range of p (dp) is inversely proportional to p^4.

So the correct option is A, which is ~1/plx^4.

To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we start by noting that parallax \( p \) is inversely proportional to distance \( d \), i.e., \( p = 1/d \). The question assumes stars are uniformly distributed in space, meaning the number density \( n \) of stars is constant.

Consider a thin spherical shell at a distance \( d \) with thickness \( \delta d \). The volume of this shell is \( 4\pi d^2 \delta d \), and the number of stars in the shell is proportional to \( n \cdot 4\pi d^2 \delta d \). To express this in terms of \( p \), we use \( d = 1/p \), so the volume becomes \( 4\pi (1/p)^2 \delta d \). The thickness \( \delta d \) can be related to \( \delta p \) via \( \delta d = (1/p^2) \delta p \). Substituting this into the volume, we get:

\[
\text{Volume} = 4\pi (1/p)^2 \cdot (1/p^2) \delta p = 4\pi / p^4 \cdot \delta p.
\]

The number of stars in this shell is then proportional to \( n \cdot \text{Volume} = n \cdot 4\pi / p^4 \cdot \delta p \). Thus, the number of stars per unit range of \( p \) (i.e., per unit \( \delta p \)) is proportional to \( 1/p^4 \).

From this analysis, the number of stars per unit range of parallax decreases as \( 1/p^4 \). Among the given options, the correct answer is:
