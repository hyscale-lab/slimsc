Okay, so I've got this question here about the quantum rotation-vibration model. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to work through it.

The question says we have a diatomic molecule made of elements X and Y. The molecule is in its fundamental state, and a photon is absorbed to switch it to the next lowest energy state. I need to find the momentum of that photon. The options are given, so I need to figure out the correct calculation.

Wait, the molecule is modeled using the rotation-vibration model. So that's the non-rigid rotor model, right? Oh wait, no, wait. The rigid rotor model is when the bond doesn't stretch, but the non-rigid one (sometimes called the rotation-vibration model) accounts for the bond vibrations. So the model here includes both rotational and vibrational energy levels.

The molecule is in the fundamental state. The fundamental state is the lowest energy state, which for a diatomic is usually the v=0 state for vibration and the J=0 state for rotation. But wait, I'm getting a bit confused. So in the rotation-vibration model, each vibrational state can have multiple rotational states, right? So the fundamental state is v=0 with the lowest possible J, which is J=0.

When a photon is absorbed, the molecule transitions to the next lowest energy state. I think that would be the first excited state. But I'm not sure whether that's the next vibrational state (v=1) or the next rotational state within the same vibrational level (v=0, J=1). Hmm, the question says "next state with the lowest possible energy." So the energy levels of the molecule are a combination of rotational and vibrational.

The energy levels for the rotation-vibration model are given by E = E_vibrational + E_rotational. The vibrational energy levels are quantized as E_v = (v + 1/2) ħω, where ω is the angular frequency. The rotational energy levels are E_J = (ħ² / (2I)) J(J+1), where I is the moment of inertia.

In the fundamental state, the molecule is at the lowest possible energy, which is v=0 and J=0. So E_initial = (0 + 1/2) ħω + (0) = (1/2) ħω.

Now, the next lowest state would be either increasing v by 1 (v=1, J=0) or increasing J by 1 (v=0, J=1), whichever has a lower energy. Wait, but which transition requires less energy? Let's compute the energies for both possibilities.

First, the energy for v=1, J=0: E1 = (1 + 1/2) ħω + (0) = (3/2) ħω. The transition from (v=0,J=0) to (v=1,J=0) will require a photon of energy E_photon = E1 - E_initial = (3/2 - 1/2) ħω = ħω.

Now, what's the energy for v=0, J=1? E2 = (0 + 1/2) ħω + (ħ²/(2I)) * 1*(1+1) = (1/2) ħω + (ħ²/(2I)) * 2 = (1/2) ħω + (ħ²/(I)).

Which of E_photon for v=1, J=0 or J=1, v=0 is lower? Let's compare E_photon for both.

For v=1, J=0: E_photon1 = ħω.

For v=0, J=1: E_photon2 = E2 - E_initial = [ (1/2) ħω + (ħ²/(I)) ] - (1/2) ħω = ħ²/(I).

So which is smaller, ħω or ħ²/(I)?

We'll have to compute both to see. Let's compute I, the moment of inertia.

I = μ r², where μ is the reduced mass and r is the bond length.

μ = (m_X * m_Y) / (m_X + m_Y). Given, mX is 20 amu, mY is 2 amu.

So μ = (20 * 2)/(20 + 2) = 40/22 ≈ 1.818 amu.

But wait, I need to convert amu to kg because the units for I are in kg·m².

1 amu is about 1.66053906660e-27 kg.

So μ = 1.818 amu * 1.6605e-27 kg/amu ≈ let's compute that.

1.818 * 1.6605e-27 ≈ let's see, 1.8 * 1.66 is around 2.988, so 2.988e-27 kg? Wait, more accurately:

1.818 * 1.6605e-27 = ?

1.8 * 1.6605 is 2.9889.

0.018 * 1.6605 = 0.029889.

So sum is 2.9889 + 0.029889 = 3.018789e-27 kg.

So μ ≈ 3.0188e-27 kg.

r is given as 2 angstroms. 1 angstrom is 1e-10 meters, so r = 2e-10 m.

I = μ r² = 3.0188e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.0188e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.2075e-46 kg·m².

Now, ħ is the reduced Planck's constant, approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

Compute ħ²/(I):

( (1.0546e-34)^2 ) / (1.2075e-46 kg·m² )

Compute numerator: (1.0546e-34)^2 ≈ 1.112e-68 (since (1e-34)^2 is 1e-68, and 1.05^2 is ~1.1).

Denominator: 1.2075e-46.

So ħ²/I = 1.112e-68 / 1.2075e-46 ≈ 9.21e-23 J.

Now, compute ħω. ω is given as 4e14 rad/s.

So ħω = 1.0546e-34 * 4e14 = 4.218e-20 J.

Compare the two: ħ²/I ≈ 9.21e-23 J, and ħω ≈ 4.218e-20 J.

Wait, 9.21e-23 is much smaller than 4.218e-20. So E_photon2 is smaller than E_photon1.

So the next possible state with the lowest energy is the one where J increases by 1 (v=0, J=1), because the required photon energy is lower.

Therefore, the molecule would absorb a photon that causes a transition from (v=0, J=0) to (v=0, J=1). So the photon's energy is E = (E_rotational for J=1) - (E_rotational for J=0), which is just E_rot = (ħ²/(2I)) * 2(2+1) - same as 2(2+1) = 6, but wait, let me think again.

Wait, the rotational energy levels are E_J = (ħ² / (2I)) J(J+1).

So initial E_rot is for J=0: 0.

After transition, J=1: E_rot = (ħ²/(2I)) * (1)(2) = ħ²/(2I) * 2 = ħ²/(I).

So the photon's energy must be ħ²/(I), which we calculated as approximately 9.21e-23 J.

Wait, no, wait. Because when the molecule is in the (v=0, J=0) state, the total energy is (1/2) ħω (vibrational) plus 0 (rotational), so (1/2) ħω.

When it transitions to (v=0, J=1), the energy is (1/2) ħω (vibrational) plus (ħ²/(2I)) * 1*2 = (ħ²/(I)).

So the energy difference is E_photon = (1/2 ħω + ħ²/(I)) - (1/2 ħω) ) = ħ²/(I).

So the photon's energy is ħ²/(I), which is about 9.21e-23 J.

But wait, the question is about the photon's momentum, not energy. So I need to find p, where p = E/c. Because for photons, E = pc, so p = E/(c).

Wait, is that correct? Because for a photon, E = hf = hc/λ. And p = E/c = h/(λ), which is h (planck constant) divided by wavelength. Alternatively, p = ħ k, where k is the wave number (k = 2π/λ). But for the purposes of this problem, I can use E = pc, so p = E/c.

Wait, but wait, E = pc is correct because for photons, their energy is E = p c. So yes, p = E/c.

So the photon's momentum p = (ħ²/(I)) / c.

We've got E_photon = ħ²/(I) = 9.21e-23 J. So p = (9.21e-23 J) / (3e8 m/s).

Compute that: 9.21e-23 / 3e8 = 3.07e-31 kg·m/s? Wait, wait, let me compute it accurately.

9.21e-23 / 3e8 = (9.21 / 3) * 1e-31 = 3.07 * 1e-31 kg m/s. So p ≈ 3.07e-31 kg·m/s.

Wait, but none of the options have anything like that. Let me look at the options again.

Options:
A) p = 1.9e-28 Ns
B) 2.3e-27 Ns
C) 1.1e-27 Ns
D) 1.4e-28 Ns

Wait, Ns is the same as kg·m/s, so the options are in units of kg·m/s, which matches.

But my calculation got p ≈ 3.07e-31 kg·m/s. That's 3.07e-31 Ns. But the options don't have anything that small. So I must have made a mistake.

Hmm, let me go back. Maybe I miscalculated the I somewhere or misunderstood the transition.

Wait, let's recheck the I calculation.

Bond length R = 2 angstroms = 2e-10 m.

Masses: Mx=20 amu, My=2 amu. So the reduced mass mu is (20 * 2 ) / (20 +2 ) = 40 /22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.81818 amu.

Convert to kg: 1.81818 amu * 1.6605e-27 kg/amu ≈ 1.81818 * 1.6605e-27.

Calculating that: 1.81818 * 1.6605. Let me compute this accurately.

1.81818 * 1 = 1.81818

1.81818 * 0.6 = 1.090908

1.81818 * 0.06 = 0.1090908

1.81818 * 0.0005 = 0.00090909

Adding up: 1.81818 + 1.090908 = 2.909088

Plus 0.1090908 → 3.0181788

Plus 0.00090909 → ~3.01908788e-27 kg.

So I = mu * R² = 3.01908788e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2.

(2e-10)^2 = 4e-20 m².

So I = 3.01908788e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.207635e-46 kg·m².

So ħ²/(I) = ( (1.0545718e-34)^2 ) / (1.207635e-46 )

Compute numerator: (1.0545718e-34)^2 ≈ 1.112e-68.

Wait, (1.0545718e-34)^2 = (1.0545718)^2 * 1e-68.

1.0545718^2 ≈ 1.112.

So numerator is ~1.112e-68 (kg² m^4/s²).

Denominator is 1.207635e-46 kg m².

Dividing, we get (1.112e-68 / 1.207635e-46 ) kg m^2 / s^2 * s^2/kg m^2 [Wait, I think I got confused, but let me compute the division.]

Wait, actually, it's (ħ²) / I. So [ (J·s)^2 / kg² m^4 ] ) / ( kg m² )

Wait, perhaps I should compute it numerically.

So ħ is 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

ħ² = (1.0545718e-34)^2 ≈ 1.112e-68 J²·s².

I is 1.207635e-46 kg·m².

So ħ²/I = 1.112e-68 / 1.207635e-46 = (1.112 / 1.207635) * 1e-22.

1.112 / 1.207635 ≈ 0.9205.

So ħ²/I ≈ 0.9205e-22 J.

Wait, 1e-68 / 1e-46 is 1e-22, right. So 1.112e-68 / 1.2076e-46 = approx 0.9205e-22 J.

So E_photon = 0.9205e-22 J.

Convert E to p: p = E/c = 0.9205e-22 J / 3e8 m/s.

0.9205e-22 / 3e8 = (0.9205 /3) * 1e-30 = ~0.3068e-30 = 3.068e-31 kg·m/s.

But none of the options are anywhere near 1e-31. The smallest option is D) 1.4e-28 Ns, which is 1.4e-28 kg·m/s.

Wait, that's about 4 orders of magnitude larger than what I calculated.

Hmm, I must have made a mistake. Let me recheck the steps.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the transition. Maybe the next state isn't a rotational transition but a vibrational one.

Wait, perhaps the question is referring to the molecule transitioning to the next state in the vibration-rotation spectrum. So each vibrational state has several rotational states. The fundamental state for the rotation-vibration model is the (v=0, J=0) state. The next state could be the (v=1, J=0) state, but that's a higher energy than (v=0, J=1) as we saw earlier. But wait, perhaps I was wrong to think that the (v=0, J=1) state is lower. Because sometimes, the energy of the rotational levels is lower than the vibrational.

Wait, let's compute the energies. Let me compute both E_vibrational and E_rotational.

E_vibrational for v=0: (0 + 1/2) ħω = 0.5 * ħ * 4e14 = 0.5 * 1.0546e-34 *4e14 ≈ 0.5 * 4.218e-20 = 2.109e-20 J.

E_rotational for J=1: (ħ²/(2I)) * 2 = ħ²/(I) as before.

So E_photon for rotational transition is ħ²/(I) ≈ 0.9205e-22 J.

E_photon for vibrational transition is ħ ω ≈ 4.218e-20 J.

So the rotational transition requires much less energy, so the photon would have lower energy, meaning the transition is easier.

But the question says, which photon would cause a transition to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the order of energy levels is:

(v=0, J=0) → (v=0, J=1) → (v=0, J=2) → ... → (v=1, J=0) → etc.

Wait, because each J level adds a certain amount of energy. The (v=0, J=1) state is lower in energy than the (v=1, J=0) state. So the first transition is to J=1, then J=2, and so on before moving to v=1.

So the next state is (v=0, J=1), requiring a photon of E = 0.9205e-22 J.

So the momentum p is E/c = (0.9205e-22 J)/(3e8 m/s) = 3.07e-31 kg m/s.

But none of the options match this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption. Alternatively, maybe the question is considering the transition to the next vibrational state, which would require more energy, but the question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy.

Wait, perhaps the molecule's energy levels are such that the (v=0, J=1) is the next state, but the problem statement says "the next state with the lowest possible energy." So perhaps the molecule needs the least energy to move to the next state, which would be the (v=0, J=1) state. But then why are the options not matching?

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated something in the I or the E_rot.

Wait, let me recompute I again.

I = μ r². μ is (20 * 2) / (20 +2 ) = 40/22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.81818 amu.

Convert to kg:

1.81818 amu * 1.6605e-27 kg/amu = let me compute this again.

1.81818 * 1.6605e-27 = ?

1.81818 * 1.6605 is about 3.018e0 (since 1.818 *1.66= ~2.998). So 3.018e-27 kg.

r is 2e-10 m. So r^2 = 4e-20 m².

I = 3.018e-27 kg * 4e-20 m² = 1.207e-46 kg·m².

Now, E_rot for J=1 is (ħ²/(2I)) * 2 = ħ²/(I).

So ħ = 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So ħ² = (1.0545718e-34)^2 ≈ 1.112e-68 (J² s²).

Then ħ²/I = 1.112e-68 / 1.207e-46 = approx 9.21e-23 J.

Wait, that's different from before. Wait, 1.112e-68 / 1.207e-46 = (1.112 / 1.207) * 1e-22 ≈ 0.921e-22 J = 9.21e-23 J.

So p = E/c = 9.21e-23 J / 3e8 m/s = 3.07e-31 kg·m/s.

Hmm, again, this doesn't match any of the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the model. Wait, the question says 'non-rigid rotor model' which includes both rotation and vibration, but perhaps the transition is considering only vibration? Or perhaps it's using a different approach.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the energy difference isn't just the rotational part. Because the molecule is in the fundamental state, which is (v=0, J=0). The next state could be the first excited state, which would be (v=1, J=0), but that requires a photon of energy ħω, which is 4.218e-20 J. But that's much higher than the rotational transition.

Wait, but earlier calculation shows that the rotational transition requires less energy, which would be the first possible transition. So why doesn't the option have that?

Alternatively, perhaps the model used is different. Maybe the question is about the rigid rotor, not the rotation-vibration model.

Wait, the question states it's the rotation-vibration model, so that includes both. So perhaps the energy levels are considered differently.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering only the vibrational transition, which would require a photon of E= ħω, and p= ħω/c.

Wait, let's compute that.

E_photon = ħω = 1.0545718e-34 *4e14 = 4.218e-20 J.

p = 4.218e-20 / 3e8 = 1.406e-28 kg·m/s.

Looking at the options, option A is 1.9e-28, D is 1.4e-28. So 1.4e-28 is option D.

But earlier calculation suggested that the (v=0, J=1) transition is lower in energy, so the correct transition would be to that state, requiring p=3e-31 kg m/s, but that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is only considering the vibrational transition, i.e., the first transition is to v=1, J=0. But why is that the case?

Wait, perhaps the question is referring to the next state in overall energy, which could be the next vibrational state. The (v=0, J=1) state is higher in energy than (v=1, J=0) because the rotational energy may be higher than the vibrational.

Wait, let's compute which transition requires less energy.

E_vibrational for v=1, J=0: E_vib = (1 + 1/2) ħω = 1.5 * ħω ≈ 6.327e-20 J.

E_rot for J=1: 9.21e-23 J.

So E_rot is much smaller than E_vib. So the (v=0, J=1) transition requires less energy than (v=1, J=0) transition. So the next state would be (v=0, J=1), but that's giving a p of ~3e-31, which isn't an option.

Another possibility: perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of I, because sometimes the bond length is given as R, but the moment of inertia is μ R²?

Wait, yes, that is correct.

Wait, perhaps the bond length is given as 2 angstroms, but in the calculation, I used 2e-10 m. Wait, 1 angstrom is 1e-10 meters, so 2 angstroms is 2e-10 m. That's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the reduced mass calculation. Let me recalculate mu.

mu = (mX * mY) / (mX + mY) = (20 * 2) / (20 +2 ) = 40 /22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.81818 amu.

Yes, correct. So 1.81818 amu.

Wait, perhaps the question is using the approximation, like using only the vibrational transition because the rotational energy levels are too close and not considered. But that doesn't make sense because it specifies the rotation-vibration model.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the first transition to the next vibrational state, meaning v=1, J=0. So the energy required is E = ħω = 4.218e-20 J, which would give p=1.4e-28 kg m/s.

Looking at the options, option D is 1.4e-28 Ns, which is 1.4e-28 kg m/s.

So perhaps that's the intended answer.

But earlier calculations suggested that (v=0, J=1) is a much lower energy transition, but since that isn't an option, perhaps the question intended the vibrational transition.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the transition to the next state in the vibrational spectrum, such as the R and P branches in the ro-vibrational spectrum, where the vibrational quantum number increases by 1 and rotational changes by ±1. But no, because the question says the next state with the lowest possible energy, which would be the (v=0, J=1) state.

But without that option, I'm confused.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the rigid rotor model, which doesn't include the vibrational energy. But no, the question states the rotation-vibration model.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the first possible transition, which is to the (v=1, J=0) state, even though it requires higher energy. But that would make the answer D: 1.4e-28.

But why would the energy required be higher than another possible transition? Because the (v=0, J=1) state is lower in energy than (v=1, J=0) state, so that should be the next state.

But since none of the options match, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of ħ²/(I). Let me recheck that.

Hmm, let me compute ħ²/(I) again.

ħ = 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

I = 1.207e-46 kg·m².

So ħ² = (1.0545718e-34)^2 = 1.112e-68 J²·s².

Divide by I: 1.112e-68 / 1.207e-46 = 9.21e-23 J.

So E = 9.21e-23 J.

Compute p: E/c = 9.21e-23 / 3e8 = 3.07e-31 kg·m/s.

None of the options match this. The options are all in the 1e-27 to 1e-28 range.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial understanding of the model. Maybe the non-rigid rotor model treats the rotational and vibrational energies together, but the fundamental state is the lowest vibrational state (v=0), and the next state is the first vibrational excited state (v=1), regardless of J. So the photon's energy is ħω, which would be 4.218e-20 J, giving p=1.4e-28 kg·m/s, which matches option D.

But why would that be the case when the rotational transition is lower in energy? Maybe the question is only considering the vibrational transition because it's the next in the vibrational spectrum, but that contradicts the model which includes lower rotational transitions.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the molecule being in the 'fundamental rotational state' but not considering the vibrational. Wait, but the model is rotation-vibration.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is using a different approach where the molecule's transition is to the next vibrational state, not considering rotational transitions, perhaps because the rotational transitions are at lower energy and hence already occur at lower photon energies, but that's not applicable here.

Wait, maybe the problem is using the vibration-only model. Let me see: if the molecule is in the fundamental vibrational state (v=0), the energy is (1/2) ħω. The next vibrational state is v=1, requiring a photon of E= ħω. So p = ħω /c = (1.05457e-34 *4e14) /3e8.

Compute that:

1.05457e-34 *4e14 = 4.218e-20 J.

p = 4.218e-20 /3e8 = 1.406e-28 kg·m/s.

Which is option D.

But earlier calculations suggested that the rotational transition is possible with lower energy. So why is the option D given?

It's possible that the question is considering only the vibrational transition, or perhaps I misunderstood the model's energy levels.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is using the rigid rotor model, which ignores the vibrational energy, but that's not the case here.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the question is referring to the combined energy of rotation and vibration, but the next state is the first vibrationally excited state, regardless of rotation.

In that case, the photon's energy must be E_photon = ħω, and p= ħω/c =4.218e-20 J /3e8 m/s= 1.406e-28 kg·m/s, which is option D.

So given the options, this is the only one that makes sense, so perhaps the intended answer is option D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the momentum of the photon required to transition the diatomic molecule from its fundamental state to the next state with the lowest possible energy, we analyze the energy levels of the rotation-vibration model. The molecule is in the fundamental state, which corresponds to the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0). The energy levels in this model are given by:

\[
E = E_{\text{vibrational}} + E_{\text{rotational}}
\]

### Key Calculations:
1. **Vibrational Energy**:  
   The vibrational energy levels are quantized as:  
   \[
   E_v = \left(v + \frac{1}{2}\right) \hbar \omega
   \]  
   For the fundamental state (v=0):  
   \[
   E_{v=0} = \frac{1}{2} \hbar \omega
   \]  
   For the first excited vibrational state (v=1):  
   \[
   E_{v=1} = \frac{3}{2} \hbar \omega
   \]  
   The energy difference for a vibrational transition is:  
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{vibrational}} = \hbar \omega
   \]

2. **Rotational Energy**:  
   The rotational energy levels are quantized as:  
   \[
   E_J = \frac{\hbar^2}{2I} J(J+1)
   \]  
   For the fundamental state (J=0):  
   \[
   E_{J=0} = 0
   \]  
   For the first excited rotational state (J=1):  
   \[
   E_{J=1} = \frac{\hbar^2}{I}
   \]  
   The moment of inertia \(I\) is calculated as:  
   \[
   I = \mu r^2
   \]  
   where \(\mu\) is the reduced mass:  
   \[
   \mu = \frac{m_X m_Y}{m_X + m_Y}
   \]  
   Substituting \(m_X = 20 \, \text{amu}\), \(m_Y = 2 \, \text{amu}\), and \(r = 2 \, \text{Å} = 2 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m}\):  
   \[
   \mu = \frac{20 \times 2}{20 + 2} = 1.818 \, \text{amu} = 3.018 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}
   \]  
   \[
   I = (3.018 \times 10^{-27}) \times (2 \times 10^{-10})^2 = 1.207 \times 10^{-46} \, \text{kg·m}^2
   \]  
   The rotational energy difference is:  
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{rotational}} = \frac{\hbar^2}{I}
   \]  
   Substituting \(\hbar = 1.0546 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}\):  
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{rotational}} = \frac{(1.0546 \times 10^{-34})^2}{1.207 \times 10^{-46}} \approx 9.21 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}
   \]

3. **Comparison of Transitions**:  
   - The energy required for a vibrational transition (v=0 to v=1) is:  
     \[
     \Delta E_{\text{vibrational}} = \hbar \omega = (1.0546 \times 10^{-34}) \times (4 \times 10^{14}) \approx 4.22 \times 10^{-20} \, \text{J}
     \]  
   - The energy required for a rotational transition (J=0 to J=1) is:  
     \[
     \Delta E_{\text{rotational}} \approx 9.21 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}
     \]  
   The rotational transition requires significantly less energy than the vibrational transition.

4. **Photon Momentum**:  
   For a vibrational transition, the photon energy is:  
   \[
   E_{\text{photon}} = \Delta E_{\text{vibrational}} = 4.22 \times 10^{-20} \, \text{J}
   \]  
   The momentum of the photon is related to its energy by:  
   \[
   p = \frac{E_{\text{photon}}}{c}
   \]  
   Substituting \(c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}\):  
   \[
   p = \frac{4.22 \times 10^{-20}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 1.41 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{kg·m/s} = 1.41 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{N·s}
   \]

### Conclusion:
The rotational transition requires less energy, but none of the options match the calculated value for this transition. The vibrational transition, while requiring more energy, matches option D. Therefore, the intended answer is based on the vibrational transition.
