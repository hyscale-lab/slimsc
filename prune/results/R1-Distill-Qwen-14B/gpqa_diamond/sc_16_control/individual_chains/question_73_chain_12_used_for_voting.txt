Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my relativity, but let's think this through.

Alright, the problem states that the two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c, both in the positive x-direction. The question is asking for the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

Wait, wait. First, I need to remember how to calculate relative speed in special relativity. Oh right, because when objects are moving at significant fractions of the speed of light, you can't just subtract their velocities like you would in classical mechanics. The formula for relative velocity in relativity is different.

The formula for the relative velocity u' is given by (u - v) / (1 - (uv)/c²), right? But wait, I think that's when you're finding the velocity of an object moving at velocity u as seen from a frame moving at velocity v. Oh right, so in this case, the two astronauts are moving in the same direction, so I guess I need to find the relative speed of one with respect to the other.

Wait no, wait. Let me clarify. Let's say astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, and astronaut B at 0.5c. So, from A's frame, what is B's speed? Or vice versa. Since both are moving in the same direction, B is moving slower than A, so from A's perspective, B is moving at a speed relative to A.

So, using the relative velocity formula. Let me assign u as the velocity of B in the lab frame (0.5c), and v as the velocity of A (0.6c). So, the relative velocity u' (from A's frame) would be (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/c²).

Wait, that would be (-0.1c)/(1 - (0.3c²)/c²). Simplify denominator: 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So, u' = (-0.1c) / 0.7. That's approximately -0.1429c. The negative sign indicates direction, but since we're talking about speed, the magnitude is 0.1429c, which is about 0.14c. That matches option C and D for the relative speed.

So the relative speed is approximately 0.14c.

Now, the total energy of the system. The total energy would be the sum of the relativistic energies of each astronaut. Each has their own gamma factor.

The relativistic energy is given by E = gamma * m c². Where gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So for astronaut A with mass 2m and v = 0.6c: gamma_A = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6c)^2/c^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.

So E_A = gamma_A * 2m c² = (1.25)(2m c²) = 2.5 m c².

For astronaut B with mass 3m and v = 0.5c: gamma_B = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1/0.8660 ≈ 1.1547.

E_B = gamma_B * 3m c² ≈ 1.1547 * 3 m c² ≈ 3.464 m c².

Adding them together: E_total = 2.5 + 3.464 ≈ 5.964 m c². So approximately 5.96 m c².

Looking at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc² and v_rel=0.14c. Option D says E=5mc².

Wait, but did I compute the gamma correctly? Let me double-check.

Astronaut A: v = 0.6c.

gamma_A = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25. Correct.

E_A = 2m * 1.25 c² = 2.5 m c².

Astronaut B: v = 0.5c.

gamma_B = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547.

E_B = 3m * 1.1547 c² ≈ 3.464 m c².

Total E ≈ 2.5 + 3.464 = 5.964 m c², so 5.96 mc² when rounded.

Looking at the options:

Option C: v_rel=0.14c, E=5.96 mc².

Option D: v_rel=0.14c, E=5 mc².

So the correct energy is 5.96 mc², which is option C.

Wait, but what about the relative velocity? Earlier calculation gave 0.1429c, which is about 0.14c, so that's correct.

So the correct answer should be option C.

To solve the problem, we calculate the relative speed and total energy of the system using relativistic mechanics.

### Relative Speed
The relative velocity between two objects moving in the same direction is given by the relativistic formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{u - v}{1 - \frac{uv}{c^2}}
\]

Here, astronaut A moves at \( v = 0.6c \), and astronaut B moves at \( u = 0.5c \). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.5c - 0.6c}{1 - \frac{(0.5c)(0.6c)}{c^2}}
\]

Simplify the denominator:

\[
1 - \frac{(0.5c)(0.6c)}{c^2} = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7
\]

Now calculate the numerator:

\[
0.5c - 0.6c = -0.1c
\]

Thus:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{-0.1c}{0.7} \approx -0.1429c
\]

The negative sign indicates direction, but the speed is the magnitude, so:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} \approx 0.14c
\]

### Total Energy of the System
The total energy of each astronaut is given by the relativistic energy formula:

\[
E = \gamma mc^2 \quad \text{where} \quad \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

#### Energy of Astronaut A (mass \( 2m \), \( v = 0.6c \)):
\[
\gamma_A = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = \frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25
\]

\[
E_A = \gamma_A \cdot 2m c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2
\]

#### Energy of Astronaut B (mass \( 3m \), \( v = 0.5c \)):
\[
\gamma_B = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]

\[
E_B = \gamma_B \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464m c^2
\]

#### Total Energy:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_A + E_B = 2.5m c^2 + 3.464m c^2 \approx 5.964m c^2
\]

Rounding to two decimal places:

\[
E_{\text{total}} \approx 5.96m c^2
\]

### Final Answer
The relative speed is \( v_{\text{rel}} \approx 0.14c \), and the total energy is \( E_{\text{total}} \approx 5.96m c^2 \). Comparing with the options:

- **Option C**: \( v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c, E = 5.96m c^2 \) — Correct.
- **Option D**: \( v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c, E = 5m c^2 \) — Incorrect energy.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
