Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when mixing some solutions. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The question says that we're mixing HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2. The amounts are 500 mL of 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL of 0.3 M H2SO4, and 200 mL of 0.5 M Ba(OH)2. And we need to find the enthalpy change.

Wait, the enthalpy of neutralization is the heat released when an acid reacts with a base to form water. Typically, it's around -57 kJ/mol for strong acids and bases, but here we have multiple acids and a base, so maybe I need to consider the equivalents.

First, I think I should calculate the moles of each acid and the base. Then, figure out which is in excess and how much reacts.

Let's start with HCl. It's a strong acid, so each mole gives one mole of H+ ions. The formula for moles is Molarity × Volume (in liters). So for HCl, 0.2 M × 0.5 L = 0.1 moles.

Next, H2SO4 is a strong acid too. But each molecule gives two H+ ions because it's diprotic. So the moles of H2SO4 are 0.3 M × 0.3 L = 0.09 moles. So the H+ from H2SO4 is 0.09 × 2 = 0.18 moles.

Wait, but wait. Actually, the question is about neutralization with Ba(OH)2. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base as well. Each mole gives two OH- ions. So let's calculate the moles of Ba(OH)2. 0.5 M × 0.2 L = 0.1 moles. So the OH- from that is 0.1 × 2 = 0.2 moles.

Now, the total H+ comes from both HCl and H2SO4. Let me add those. HCl gives 0.1 moles H+ and H2SO4 gives 0.18 moles H+. So total H+ is 0.28 moles.

The OH- is 0.2 moles. So when they react, the H+ and OH- will neutralize each other. The reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O, and this releases heat.

So the limiting reagent here is OH- because we have 0.28 moles H+ and 0.2 moles OH-. So all the OH- will react, and some H+ will remain.

Wait, wait. Wait, the OH- is 0.2 moles. So that will react with 0.2 moles of H+. The total H+ available is 0.28, so after neutralization, 0.08 moles of H+ will be left. But the problem is about the neutralization reaction, so the heat released is based on the amount that actually reacted.

Now, each mole of H+ and OH- reacting releases about 57 kJ (or sometimes taken as 57.3 kJ per mole in some contexts, but usually around that). But wait, wait, wait, wait. Let me think. The standard enthalpy of neutralization is often given as -57 kJ/mol for strong acids and bases. So each mole of H+ reacting with OH- gives off 57 kJ.

So for 0.2 moles reacting, that would be 0.2 × 57 kJ = 11.4 kJ. Wait, but wait, the question gives the options in kcal and kJ. Oh, because 1 kcal is approximately 4.184 kJ. So 11.4 kJ is about 11.4 /4.184 ≈ 2.72 kcal. But wait, enthalpy is exothermic, so it's negative. So the enthalpy change is -11.4 kJ or -2.72 kcal.

Looking at the options: Option A is -2.72 kcal, which is the same as 11.4 kJ but negative. Option D is -16.0 kJ, which is larger. So which is correct?

Wait, but wait. Wait, no. Hmm. Because the H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, so each mole gives two H+. But in the reaction with Ba(OH)2, which is a strong base, the neutralization is between H+ and OH-.

But wait, in the case of H2SO4, when it's a strong acid, it dissociates completely. So for H2SO4, each mole gives 2 H+.

Wait, but when we mix the solutions, the total H+ comes from both acids. So HCl gives 0.1 moles H+ (since 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 mol), and H2SO4 gives 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 mol H2SO4, which gives 0.18 mol H+.

The Ba(OH)2 is 0.5 M * 0.2 L = 0.1 mol, and each gives 2 OH-, so 0.2 mol OH-.

So the reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O. The limiting reagent is OH- because we have 0.2 mol OH- and 0.28 mol H+.

So all 0.2 mol OH- reacts, using up 0.2 mol H+, leaving 0.08 mol H+.

The heat released is 0.2 * 57 kJ/mol = 11.4 kJ. Wait, but wait, wait. Alternatively, some sources use 57.3 kJ/mol as the standard value, but that's probably negligible here.

So 11.4 kJ is 11420 J. But looking at the options, option B is -11.42 kcal. Wait, no, because 11.4 kJ is about 2.72 kcal (since 1 kcal is ~4.184 kJ, so 11.4 /4.184 ≈ 2.72).

Wait wait, wait a minute. Let me double-check the calculations.

Wait, 0.2 mol H+ reacting. Each mole releases 57 kJ, so 0.2 *57=11.4 kJ. That's 11.4 kJ, which is approximately 11.4 /4.184 ≈ 2.72 kcal. So the enthalpy change is -11.4 kJ or -2.72 kcal.

Looking at the options:

Option A) -2.72 kcal

Option B) -11.42 kcal

Option C) -3.80 kcal

Option D) -16.0 kJ

So option A is -2.72 kcal and option D is -16 kJ. Wait, but 11.4 kJ is about 2.72 kcal. So if the enthalpy change is -11.4 kJ, that's equivalent to -2.72 kcal. Therefore, the correct answer would be A or D, but wait the options are in different units.

Wait, but another thought: the enthalpy of neutralization is usually per mole of H+ reacting. So yes, 0.2 mol H+ would lead to -11.4 kJ, which is about -2.72 kcal. So option A is -2.72 kcal, which matches. So the correct answer is A.

Wait, but wait. Let me recheck the calculations for moles.

HCl: 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 mol HCl → 0.1 mol H+.

H2SO4: 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 mol H2SO4 → 2 * 0.09 = 0.18 mol H+.

Total H+: 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 mol.

Ba(OH)2: 0.5 M * 0.2 L = 0.1 mol Ba(OH)2 → 2 OH-, so 0.2 mol OH-.

Reaction: H+ + OH- → H2O.

Which is the limiting reactant? OH- is 0.2 mol, H+ is 0.28. So OH- will run out first. So all 0.2 mol OH- reacts, using 0.2 mol H+.

Thus, the heat released is 0.2 * 57 kJ = 11.4 kJ → which is approximately 2.72 kcal (since 11.4 /4.184 ≈ 2.72). So the enthalpy change is -11.4 kJ or -2.72 kcal.

Looking back at the options, option A is -2.72 kcal, but option D is -16.0 kJ. Wait, 11.4 kJ is much less than 16, so why is option D even there? Maybe a miscalculation.

Wait, did I make a mistake in the moles? Let me recalculate:

HCl: 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 mol. Correct.

H2SO4: 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 mol → 0.18 mol H+.

Ba(OH)2: 0.5 M * 0.2 L = 0.1 mol → 0.2 mol OH-.

So yes, 0.2 mol OH- reacting, which uses 0.2 mol H+. So 0.2 *57=11.4 kJ.

So the answer should be -11.4 kJ, but looking at the options, D is -16 kJ, which doesn't match. Alternatively, maybe I missed something else.

Wait, another approach: considering that H2SO4 is diprotic, but when in solution, it may donate both H+ ions, so when neutralized, each mole of H+ reacts with OH-.

Wait, another point to consider: the stoichiometry of the reactions. But in neutralization, each H+ reacts with each OH- regardless of the source. So the total H+ is 0.28, OH- is 0.2. So the limiting is OH-.

Wait, but wait, wait, what if the Ba(OH)2 has a different stoichiometry? Ba(OH)2 → Ba^2+ + 2 OH^-.

So when you have 0.1 mol Ba(OH)2, you get 0.2 mol OH^-.

HCl → H+ + Cl^-.

H2SO4 → 2 H+ + SO4^2-.

So the total H+ is 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28.

So when the OH- (0.2 mol) reacts, it neutralizes 0.2 mol H+.

So the heat released is 0.2 mol * 57 kJ/mol = 11.4 kJ.

But wait, in some cases, the enthalpy of neutralization is per mole of acid or per mole of base, but in this case, it's per mole of H+ reacting.

So 11.4 kJ is the correct value. Now, looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ, which is larger than 11.4. So that might not be the correct answer. But option A is -2.72 kcal, which is about 11.4 kJ. So the correct answer is either A or D, but in the options, they are presented as kcal and kJ.

Wait, the options are:

A) -2.72 kcal

B) -11.42 kcal

C) -3.80 kcal

D) -16.0 kJ

So 11.4 kJ is about 2.72 kcal. So option A is -2.72 kcal, which is correct. Option D is -16.0 kJ, which is much larger, so that's not matching.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation somewhere. Let me check again.

Wait, 500 mL is 0.5 L, correct.

HCl: 0.2 M × 0.5 L = 0.1 mol.

H2SO4: 0.3 M × 0.3 L = 0.09 mol → 0.18 mol H+.

Ba(OH)2: 0.5 M × 0.2 L = 0.1 mol → 0.2 mol OH-.

So, the H+ is 0.28, OH- is 0.2. So 0.2 reacts, heat is 0.2 ×57=11.4 kJ.

So 11.4 kJ is 11,400 J. Converting to kcal: 11,400 J /4184 J/kcal ≈ 2.727 kcal. So the enthalpy change is -2.727 kcal, which is approximately -2.73 kcal. Looking at the options, option A is -2.72 kcal, which is very close.

So the correct answer is A.

To calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when mixing the given solutions, we first determine the moles of H⁺ and OH⁻ ions available:

1. **HCl (strong acid):**  
   Moles of HCl = \( 0.2 \, \text{M} \times 0.5 \, \text{L} = 0.1 \, \text{mol} \).  
   Each mole of HCl contributes 1 mole of H⁺, so moles of H⁺ from HCl = \( 0.1 \, \text{mol} \).

2. **H₂SO₄ (strong acid):**  
   Moles of H₂SO₄ = \( 0.3 \, \text{M} \times 0.3 \, \text{L} = 0.09 \, \text{mol} \).  
   Each mole of H₂SO₄ contributes 2 moles of H⁺, so moles of H⁺ from H₂SO₄ = \( 0.09 \times 2 = 0.18 \, \text{mol} \).

3. **Ba(OH)₂ (strong base):**  
   Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = \( 0.5 \, \text{M} \times 0.2 \, \text{L} = 0.1 \, \text{mol} \).  
   Each mole of Ba(OH)₂ contributes 2 moles of OH⁻, so moles of OH⁻ = \( 0.1 \times 2 = 0.2 \, \text{mol} \).

Next, we identify the limiting reagent. The total moles of H⁺ are:  
\[
0.1 \, \text{mol (from HCl)} + 0.18 \, \text{mol (from H₂SO₄)} = 0.28 \, \text{mol}.
\]  
The moles of OH⁻ are \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \). Since OH⁻ is the limiting reagent, all \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \) of OH⁻ will react with \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \) of H⁺ to form water.

The enthalpy of neutralization for each mole of H⁺ and OH⁻ reacting is approximately \( -57 \, \text{kJ/mol} \). Therefore, the total heat released is:  
\[
0.2 \, \text{mol} \times 57 \, \text{kJ/mol} = 11.4 \, \text{kJ}.
\]  
Converting to kilocalories (\( 1 \, \text{kcal} = 4.184 \, \text{kJ} \)):  
\[
11.4 \, \text{kJ} \div 4.184 \, \text{kJ/kcal} \approx 2.72 \, \text{kcal}.
\]  
The enthalpy change is exothermic, so the final value is \( -2.72 \, \text{kcal} \).

Examining the options:  
- **A) -2.72 kcal:** Matches the calculated value.  
- **B) -11.42 kcal:** Incorrect, as it overestimates the enthalpy change.  
- **C) -3.80 kcal:** Incorrect, as it does not match the calculation.  
- **D) -16.0 kJ:** Incorrect, as it does not match the calculated value in kilojoules.

The correct answer is **A**.
