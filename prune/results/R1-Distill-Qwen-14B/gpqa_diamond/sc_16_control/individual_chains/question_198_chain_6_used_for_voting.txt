Okay, so I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem, and I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it step by step. The question is about finding the percentage of a specific cobalt complex in solution. Let me read the question again.

We have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-) ions. The total cobalt concentration is 10^-2 M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants for the Co(II) thiocyanato complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. We need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species.

Wait, the blue dithiocyanato complex—what's that? I think I remember that the different complexes have different colors. For example, [Co(SCN)] is maybe pink, and the dithiocyanato ones could be blue. But I'm not entirely sure. But perhaps the question refers to the Co(SCN)_n complexes where n is 2 or something else? Hmm, wait, the stability constants are given as β1 to β4, so probably the complexes are [Co(SCN)]^+, [Co(SCN)_2]^0, [Co(SCN)_3]^- , and [Co(SCN)_4]^2-? Or maybe another order, but that's the idea.

Wait, I think the stability constant β is defined as the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex from the ions. So βn = [Co(SCN)_n] / ( [Co^{2+}][SCN^-]^n ). So the first complex would be [Co(SCN)]^+ with β1=9, second [Co(SCN)_2]^0 with β2=40, third [Co(SCN)_3]^- with β3=63, and fourth [Co(SCN)_4]^2- with β4=16.

But wait, stability constants usually increase with more ligands, but here β4 is lower than β3. Hmm, maybe I got the order of the complexes or their charges wrong. Or perhaps the stability constants are in a different order. Wait, maybe I should think about the order of the complexes in terms of the number of SCN- ligands attached.

Wait, the problem is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex. Dithiocyanato would have two SCN- ligands. So the complex would be [Co(SCN)_2]^0, which is the second complex with β2=40.

So the question is asking for the percentage of [Co(SCN)_2] in the solution, considering all possible cobalt species.

The total cobalt concentration is given as c(Co) = 1e-2 M, and [SCN^-] is 0.1 M. So the solution is pretty concentrated in SCN-.

So to find the percentage, I think I need to calculate the concentrations of each of the four complexes and then find which one is the blue dithiocyanato (probably the β2 complex) and sum its percentage.

Wait, but the total cobalt is the sum of all species: [Co^2+], [Co(SCN)]^+, [Co(SCN)_2]^0, [Co(SCN)_3]^- , [Co(SCN)_4]^2-.

So to find the fraction of each, we can use the stability constants and the concentrations of Co and SCN-.

I think the general approach is to calculate the fraction of each complex using the formula for each βn, considering the concentrations.

Wait, the standard way to calculate the distribution of metal complexes is using the stability constants and the concentrations of the metal and ligand. The fraction of each complex can be found using βn and the reaction quotient.

Alternatively, the fraction f_n of the n-th complex is given by:

f_n = (β_n [Co^{2+}] [SCN^-]^n ) / ( Σ_{m=0}^4 β_m [Co^{2+}] [SCN^-]^m )

But wait, the sum would be from m=0 to m=4, but [Co^{2+}] is the same for each term, so perhaps we can factor that out.

Wait, let me think again. The fraction of each complex is the concentration of that complex divided by the total concentration of all complexes and free ions. Wait, no, the total cobalt concentration is the sum of all species: [Co^{2+}] + [Co(SCN)]^+ + [Co(SCN)_2]^0 + [Co(SCN)_3]^- + [Co(SCN)_4]^2- = c_total.

So the sum is: c_total = [Co^2+] + [CoSCN]^+ + [Co(SCN)_2]^0 + [Co(SCN)_3]^- + [Co(SCN)_4]^2-.

But each complex's concentration can be expressed in terms of [Co^2+] and [SCN^-].

So for each complex, the concentration [Co(SCN)_n] is equal to βn [Co^2+][SCN^-]^n.

Wait, that's because the stability constant is βn = [Co(SCN)_n] / ([Co^2+][SCN^-]^n), so rearranging, [Co(SCN)_n] = βn [Co^2+][SCN^-]^n.

So if I let [Co^2+] be x, then each complex is βn * x * (0.1)^n.

Then the total cobalt concentration c_total is x + Σ (βn x (0.1)^n) from n=1 to 4.

Wait, because n=0 would be [Co^2+], which is x. But the complexes are n=1 (β1) to n=4 (β4). Wait, no, because the first complex is [Co(SCN)]^+ (n=1), which corresponds to β1=9. So the sum for the complexes is β1 x (0.1)^1 + β2 x (0.1)^2 + β3 x (0.1)^3 + β4 x (0.1)^4.

So the total c_total is x + [β1 x (0.1) + β2 x (0.1)^2 + β3 x (0.1)^3 + β4 x (0.1)^4] = 1e-2.

So let me write this equation:

x [ 1 + β1 * 0.1 + β2 * 0.1^2 + β3 * 0.1^3 + β4 * 0.1^4 ] = 1e-2.

I can compute the terms inside the brackets.

Compute each term:

β1*0.1 = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9.

β2 * 0.1^2 =40 * 0.01 = 0.4.

β3 *0.1^3=63 *0.001=0.063.

β4 *0.1^4=16 * 0.0001=0.0016.

Add them all:

1 (from x) + 0.9 + 0.4 +0.063 +0.0016 = let's add step by step:

1 + 0.9 =1.9.

1.9 +0.4=2.3.

2.3 +0.063=2.363.

2.363 +0.0016=2.3646.

So the equation becomes x * 2.3646 = 1e-2.

So x = (1e-2) / 2.3646 ≈ 0.004224.

So [Co^2+] is approximately 0.004224 M.

Now, the concentration of each complex can be calculated as βn * x * (0.1)^n.

So for n=1 (β1=9, first complex [CoSCN]^+):

[CoSCN]^+ = 9 * 0.004224 * (0.1) =9 * 0.004224 * 0.1=9 * 0.0004224=0.0038016 M.

n=2 (β2=40, [Co(SCN)_2]^0):

[Co(SCN)_2]^0 =40 * 0.004224 * (0.1)^2 =40 *0.004224*0.01=40 *0.00004224=0.0016896 M.

n=3 (β3=63, [Co(SCN)_3}^-):

=63 *0.004224 * (0.1)^3=63 *0.004224 *0.001=63 *0.000004224=0.000266 M.

n=4 (β4=16, [Co(SCN)_4]^2-):

=16 *0.004224 * (0.1)^4=16 *0.004224 *0.0001=16 * 0.0000004224=0.000067584 M.

So now, let's compute all the concentrations:

[Co^2+] = x ≈ 0.004224 M.

[CoSCN]^+ ≈ 0.0038016 M.

[Co(SCN)_2]^0 ≈ 0.0016896 M.

[CoSCN_3]^- ≈ 0.000266 M.

[CoSCN_4]^2- ≈ 0.000067584 M.

Wait, but let's check if the sum of all these equals the total cobalt concentration, which is 1e-2 M.

Sum:

0.004224 + 0.0038016 = 0.0080256.

Adding 0.0016896 → 0.0097152.

Adding 0.000266 → 0.0099812.

Adding 0.000067584 → 0.010048784.

Hmm, that's a bit more than 1e-2. Maybe I made a mistake in calculations or rounding.

Wait, perhaps more precise calculation for x?

Wait, let me compute 2.3646 again. Let me recheck the terms:

1 + 0.9 =1.9

+0.4 →2.3

+0.063 →2.363

+0.0016 →2.3646.

So that's correct.

So x = (1e-2) / 2.3646.

Let me compute 1e-2 / 2.3646.

1e-2 is 0.01.

Divide by 2.3646:

0.01 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.004224.

So [Co^2+] is 0.004224 M.

Then the concentrations:

For n=1: 9 * 0.004224 *0.1=0.0038016.

n=2:40 *0.004224 *0.01=0.0016896.

n=3:63 *0.004224 *0.001=0.000266.

n=4:16 *0.004224 *0.0001=0.000067584.

Sum:

0.004224 + 0.0038016 = 0.0080256.

+0.0016896 →0.0097152.

+0.000266 →0.0099812.

+0.000067584 →0.010048784.

Ah, it's 0.010048784, which is about 1.0048784e-2 M, slightly higher than 1e-2. That suggests that perhaps the assumption is slightly off due to rounding errors in x. Alternatively, perhaps this is okay, as the error is small.

But for the purpose of this problem, perhaps we can proceed with these approximate values.

Now, the question is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes. I think that's [Co(SCN)_2]^0, which is the n=2 complex.

So the concentration of [Co(SCN)_2]^0 is approximately 0.0016896 M.

The total cobalt species is 0.010048784 M, as above.

So the fraction is (0.0016896) / (0.010048784) ≈ 0.16813, which is approximately 16.813%.

Looking at the options, option D is 16.9%, which is very close.

Wait, but wait. Let me recompute the fractions more accurately without rounding errors.

Let me compute each term again with more precision.

x = 0.01 / 2.3646.

Compute 2.3646 * x should be 0.01.

Wait, 2.3646 * 0.004224 ≈ 0.01, so x is accurate.

Compute each [Co(SCN)_n]:

n=1:

9 * x * 0.1 = 9 * 0.004224 * 0.1 = 9 * 0.0004224 = 0.0038016.

n=2:

40 * x * 0.01 =40 *0.004224 *0.01 =40 *0.00004224=0.0016896.

n=3:

63 * x *0.001=63 *0.004224*0.001=63 * 0.000004224=0.000266.

n=4:

16 *x *0.0001=16 *0.004224 *0.0001=16 *0.0000004224=0.000067584.

So the sum is:

x=0.004224,

n1=0.0038016,

n2=0.0016896,

n3=0.000266,

n4=0.000067584.

Total= 0.004224 + 0.0038016 = 0.0080256.

+0.0016896 →0.0097152.

+0.000266 →0.0099812.

+0.000067584 →0.010048784.

So the sum is 0.010048784, which is 1.0048784e-2.

Now, the fraction for n=2 is 0.0016896 / 0.010048784.

Let me compute that.

0.0016896 / 0.010048784 ≈ ?

Let me compute it as 1689.6 / 10048.784.

So 1689.6 ÷ 10048.784 ≈ 0.1681.

So approximately 16.81%.

Looking at the options, option D is 16.9%. So that's the closest.

Wait, but another approach is to compute the exact value.

Alternatively, perhaps my assumption about which complex is the blue one is incorrect. Let's think again: sometimes, the [Co(SCN)_2]^+ is called the 'blue' complex, but I'm not entirely sure. Wait, the problem says 'blue dithiocyanato', so dithiocyanato implies two SCN ligands. So [Co(SCN)_2]^0, which is n=2, β2=40.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the blue complex is [Co(SCN)_4]^2- or another. Maybe I should double-check, but in the context of the problem, I think the intended complex is the one with β2=40.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is not about the dithiocyanato complex but another. Wait, the question says 'blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes' which suggests two SCN ligands. So [Co(SCN)_2]^0, which is the β2 complex.

So the percentage is about 16.8%, which is close to 16.9%, so option D.

But wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the fractions. Let me compute the exact fraction.

Compute [Co(SCN)_2]/total.

[Co(SCN)_2] = 0.0016896.

Total cobalt = 0.010048784.

0.0016896 / 0.010048784 = ?

Let me compute 0.0016896 ÷ 0.010048784.

Dividing both numerator and denominator by 0.0000001 to make it easier: 16896 ÷ 100487.84 = approximately 0.1681.

Which is 16.81%.

So 16.81% is approximately 16.8%, which is close to option D's 16.9%.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Wait, let's compute more accurately.

Exact calculation of the denominator:

Denominator: 0.004224 + 0.0038016 = 0.0080256.

Adding the next term: 0.0016896 → 0.0097152.

Adding n=3: 0.000266 → 0.0099812.

Adding n=4:0.000067584 → 0.010048784.

So denominator is 0.010048784 M.

[Co(SCN)_2] is 0.0016896.

So 0.0016896 / 0.010048784 = ?

Compute 0.0016896 ÷ 0.010048784.

Let me compute:

0.010048784 = 1.0048784e-2.

So 0.0016896 = 1.6896e-3.

So 1.6896e-3 / 1.0048784e-2 = (1.6896 / 10.048784) * 0.1.

Wait, 1.6896 /10.048784 ≈ 0.1681.

So 0.1681 * 0.1 → 0.01681? No, wait, no, because 1e-3 divided by 1e-2 is 0.1.

Wait, let me compute 1.6896e-3 /1.0048784e-2.

Same as (1.6896 / 10.048784) * (1e-3 /1e-2) = (approx 0.1681) * 0.1 → no, wait, 1e-3 /1e-2 is 0.1.

Wait, no, 1e-3 divided by1e-2 is 0.1.

So 1.6896e-3 = 0.0016896.

1.0048784e-2 =0.010048784.

So 0.0016896 / 0.010048784 = (0.0016896 /0.01) * (1 /1.0048784) ≈ 0.16896 * (0.99517) ≈ 0.1674.

Wait, wait, 0.0016896 /0.010048784.

Let me compute this as 1689.6 / 10048.784.

Compute 10048.784 * 0.168 = 10048.784 * 0.1 =1004.8784, 10048.784 *0.06=602.927, 10048.784 *0.008=80.390.

Adding:1004.8784 +602.927=1607.8054 +80.390=1688.1954.

Which is close to 1689.6. So 0.168 gives 1688.1954, which is about 1.4046 less than 1689.6.

So 1689.6 -1688.1954=1.4046.

So how much more is needed?

Each 0.0001 increase in 0.168 would contribute 10048.784 *0.0001=1.0048784.

So to get the remaining 1.4046, we need approximately 1.4046 /1.0048784 ≈ 1.397 * 0.0001.

So 0.168 + 0.0001397 ≈ 0.1681397.

So the fraction is approximately 0.16814, which is 16.814%.

So the percentage is about 16.81%, which is very close to option D:16.9%.

But wait, perhaps the question is about the dithiocyanato complex being [Co(SCN)_2]^+ (n=1), but I thought that was the first complex. But no, the first complex is [CoSCN]+ (n=1), and the dithiocyanato would be n=2.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the term 'dithiocyanato' to mean four SCN ligands, but that doesn't seem right. Dithiocyanato usually means two SCN groups. So n=2.

So I think option D is the correct answer.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)_2]^0, among all cobalt-containing species in the solution, we analyze the distribution of cobalt species using the given stability constants and concentrations.

### Key Information:
- Total cobalt concentration: \( c(\text{Co}) = 10^{-2} \, \text{M} \)
- Thiocyanate concentration: \( [\text{SCN}^-] = 0.1 \, \text{M} \)
- Stability constants:  
  \(\beta_1 = 9\), \(\beta_2 = 40\), \(\beta_3 = 63\), \(\beta_4 = 16\).

The stability constant \(\beta_n\) is defined as:  
\[
\beta_n = \frac{[\text{Co(SCN)}_n]}{[\text{Co}^{2+}][\text{SCN}^-]^n}
\]
From this, the concentration of each cobalt complex can be expressed as:  
\[
[\text{Co(SCN)}_n] = \beta_n [\text{Co}^{2+}] [\text{SCN}^-]^n
\]

### Total Cobalt Concentration:
The total cobalt concentration is the sum of all species:  
\[
c(\text{Co}) = [\text{Co}^{2+}] + [\text{Co(SCN)}]^{+} + [\text{Co(SCN)_2}]^0 + [\text{Co(SCN)_3}]^- + [\text{Co(SCN)_4}]^{2-}
\]
Substituting the expressions for each complex:  
\[
c(\text{Co}) = [\text{Co}^{2+}] + \beta_1 [\text{Co}^{2+}] [\text{SCN}^-]^1 + \beta_2 [\text{Co}^{2+}] [\text{SCN}^-]^2 + \beta_3 [\text{Co}^{2+}] [\text{SCN}^-]^3 + \beta_4 [\text{Co}^{2+}] [\text{SCN}^-]^4
\]
Let \( [\text{Co}^{2+}] = x \). Factoring out \( x \):  
\[
c(\text{Co}) = x \left( 1 + \beta_1 [\text{SCN}^-]^1 + \beta_2 [\text{SCN}^-]^2 + \beta_3 [\text{SCN}^-]^3 + \beta_4 [\text{SCN}^-]^4 \right)
\]
Substituting \( [\text{SCN}^-] = 0.1 \, \text{M} \):  
\[
1 + \beta_1 (0.1) + \beta_2 (0.1)^2 + \beta_3 (0.1)^3 + \beta_4 (0.1)^4
\]
\[
= 1 + 9(0.1) + 40(0.01) + 63(0.001) + 16(0.0001)
\]
\[
= 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646
\]
Thus:  
\[
x = \frac{c(\text{Co})}{2.3646} = \frac{10^{-2}}{2.3646} \approx 0.004224 \, \text{M}
\]

### Concentrations of Each Complex:
Using \( [\text{Co(SCN)}_n] = \beta_n x [\text{SCN}^-]^n \), calculate the concentration of each complex:  
1. \( [\text{Co(SCN)}]^{+} = \beta_1 x (0.1)^1 = 9(0.004224)(0.1) = 0.0038016 \, \text{M} \)  
2. \( [\text{Co(SCN)_2}]^0 = \beta_2 x (0.1)^2 = 40(0.004224)(0.01) = 0.0016896 \, \text{M} \)  
3. \( [\text{Co(SCN)_3}]^- = \beta_3 x (0.1)^3 = 63(0.004224)(0.001) = 0.000266 \, \text{M} \)  
4. \( [\text{Co(SCN)_4}]^{2-} = \beta_4 x (0.1)^4 = 16(0.004224)(0.0001) = 0.000067584 \, \text{M} \)  

### Total Cobalt Verification:
Sum of all species:  
\[
[\text{Co}^{2+}] + [\text{Co(SCN)}]^{+} + [\text{Co(SCN)_2}]^0 + [\text{Co(SCN)_3}]^- + [\text{Co(SCN)_4}]^{2-}
\]
\[
= 0.004224 + 0.0038016 + 0.0016896 + 0.000266 + 0.000067584 \approx 0.010048784 \, \text{M}
\]
This matches the total cobalt concentration, confirming the calculations.

### Percentage of Blue Dithiocyanato Complex:
The blue dithiocyanato complex is [Co(SCN)_2]^0. Its concentration is \( 0.0016896 \, \text{M} \). The percentage is:  
\[
\text{Percentage} = \frac{[\text{Co(SCN)_2}]^0}{c(\text{Co})} \times 100 = \frac{0.0016896}{0.010048784} \times 100 \approx 16.81\%
\]
The closest option is **16.9%**.

ANSWER: D
