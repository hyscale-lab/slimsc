Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem says that astronomers are looking for exoplanets around two stars that have the same mass as the Sun. They found one planet each using the radial velocity (RV) method. Both planets have masses similar to Neptune. The planets are in circular orbits.

The key part is about the spectral line shifts. Planet #1 caused a shift of up to 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2 caused a shift of 7 milliangstroms. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1. The options are A to D, with some numbers.

Hmm, I remember that the RV method involves measuring the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum because the planet's gravity makes the star move. The star moves towards and away from us, causing the spectral lines to shift. The size of this shift depends on the mass of the planet and the orbital period, I think.

Wait, but how exactly? I remember there's a formula related to the radial velocity semi-amplitude. Oh right, the formula is something like K = (v) = (2πG)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) )^(1/ something). Wait, maybe I should get the exact formula.

I think the formula is K = (v) = [ (G * M_p * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p) * (P/(2π)) ) ) ]^(1/3) * (1/(c)) ) But I'm not sure. Alternatively, I remember the simplified version where K is proportional to (M_p / M_star) / (P)^(1/3), but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details.

Wait, another approach: the RV semi-amplitude is given by K = (v) = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p) * (1 - e²)^(3/2) ) ) ]^(1/3) * (sin i) / (c * (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3)) ) ?

Wait, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude, which is:

K = ( (2πG) / (c P) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) )

But since both stars have the same mass as the Sun and the planets are Neptune-like, M_p is much smaller than M_star. So M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. Also, sin i is probably similar for both, as they're using the same method and the angles might be similar; but maybe we can assume sin i is the same for both planets. Or perhaps it's not given, so we might need to assume it's the same?

Wait, but the problem doesn't mention inclination, so perhaps we can assume that the inclination angle i is the same for both planets, or that sin i is the same. Or maybe it doesn't matter because K is proportional to (M_p) / (M_star^(2/3) P^(1/3)). Hmm.

Wait, another approach: since the two stars have the same mass (same as Sun), and the two planets have similar masses (Neptune-like), which is much less than the star's mass, so M_p << M_star. So, M_p / (M_star + M_p) ≈ M_p / M_star. 

So, the formula simplifies. Let's see:

K is proportional to (M_p) / (M_star^(2/3) * P^(1/3)).

Wait, but since K is the velocity semi-amplitude, the formula for K is:

K = [ (G * M_p) / (M_star) ) ]^(1/3) * (1 / (P)^(1/3)) ) * ( 1 / c ) ) * something.

Wait, I think the correct formula is:

K = (v) = ( (G * (M_p) * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p) * (1 - e²)^(3/2) ) ) )^(1/3) * (1 / ( (2π)^(1/3) * c )) ) * (2π / P) )

Wait, maybe it's better to look up the formula. Oh wait, I can't look it up right now, but I remember that K is proportional to (M_p / M_star)^(1/3) * (1 / P^(1/3)) ), but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, another approach. The RV method measures the velocity of the star due to the planet. The formula I found earlier (I think) is:

K = (v) = ( (G * M_p * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * (1 - e²)^(3/2) ) * (2π / P) ) )^(1/3) )

Wait, maybe I should write K in terms of P.

Alternatively, knowing that the RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star) * (1 + M_p/M_star) ) ) ]^(1/3) * ( 1/(c) ) * ( (2π) / P ) )^(1/3) ) * [ (1 - e²)^(3/2) ]^(-1/3) )

Wait, perhaps that's getting too complicated. Let me try to find the dependence between K and P, assuming e is zero (since both orbits are circular), and M_p << M_star.

If e=0, then 1 - e^2 = 1. So the term involving e drops out.

So, K ≈ ( (G * M_p ) / (M_star^2) )^(1/3) * ( (2π) / (c * P) ) )^(1/3) )

Wait, but I think I'm mixing terms here. Let me see.

Another way: The radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( (2π G) / (c P) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) )

Since M_p is much less than M_star, M_star + M_p ≈ M_star, so denominator becomes M_star^(2/3).

So, K ≈ ( (2π G) / (c P) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3) )

But since both stars have the same mass, and the planets have similar masses, M_p and sin i are similar.

So, K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). Because the other factors (M_p, M_star, sin i) are about the same for both planets.

So, K ∝ 1 / P^(1/3) → P ∝ 1 / K^(3)

Wait, because if K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), then P is proportional to (1/K)^3.

So, P1 ∝ (1/K1)^3 and P2 ∝ (1/K2)^3. So the ratio P2/P1 would be (K1/K2)^3.

Wait, let me think again. If K = A / P^(1/3), where A is a constant for both planets (since M_p, M_star, etc., are same), then P = (A / K )^3. So, P2 / P1 = (K1 / K2 )^3.

Wait, because:

K1 = A / P1^(1/3) → P1^(1/3) = A / K1 → P1 = (A/K1)^3.

Similarly, P2 = (A/K2)^3.

So P2 / P1 = (A/K2)^3 / (A/K1)^3 ) = (K1/K2 )^3.

So the ratio P2/P1 is (K1/K2)^3.

Wait, but in the problem, Planet #1 has a shift of 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2 has a shift of 7. So K1 =5, K2=7? Because the shift is proportional to K, right? Because K is the velocity.

Wait, yes, because the shift in wavelength is directly related to the velocity via the Doppler effect. The formula for the Doppler shift is Δλ/λ ≈ v/c, assuming v is much smaller than c. So, the shift (in milliangstroms) is proportional to the velocity (K), since the star's spectral lines shift by an amount proportional to its velocity.

So, K1 = 5, K2=7 (in some units, but same units for both). 

So, the ratio P2/P1 is (K1/K2)^3 = (5/7)^3 = 125 / 343 ≈ 0.364.

Wait, wait. P2 is the period of Planet #2, and we're asked how many times longer it is than Planet #1's period. So, if P2 is longer than P1, the ratio would be greater than 1. But according to this, 0.364, which is less than 1. That would mean P2 is shorter than P1.

But that can't be right. Hmm. Did I get the ratio backwards?

Wait, let's double-check. So K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So when K increases, P decreases. Because K = A / P^(1/3), so if K is bigger, P must be smaller. 

In this problem, Planet #2 has a bigger K (7 vs 5), so its P must be smaller. So the period of Planet #2 is shorter than that of Planet #1. So when the question asks, "how many times longer is P2 than P1", the answer would be less than 1. But looking at the options, the only option less than 1 is option A (0.36) and D (0.85). So our calculation of ~0.36 is an option (A). So that would be the case.

Wait, but let me make sure. Because the exoplanets are both detected via RV, and the shifts are their K values. So K1=5, K2=7.

So, K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So, K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3) → (5/7) = (P2/P1)^(1/3) → cube both sides: (5/7)^3 = P2/P1.

Which is (125)/(343) ≈ 0.364. So P2 is about 0.364 times P1. So P2 is shorter than P1 by a factor of ~0.36. So the answer would be option A, 0.36.

But wait, the question is "how many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?" So if the ratio P2/P1 is 0.36, that means P2 is about 0.36 times P1. So it's 36% as long, not longer. So the answer would be approximately 0.36 times, which is option A.

So the correct answer is A.

The problem involves determining how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1, given their respective radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitudes. Both stars have the same mass as the Sun, and the planets have similar Neptune-like masses. The RV method measures the Doppler shift of the star's spectral lines, which is proportional to the star's velocity due to the planet. 

The RV semi-amplitude \( K \) is inversely proportional to the orbital period \( P \) raised to the power of \( 1/3 \), i.e., \( K \propto 1/P^{1/3} \). This relationship implies that \( P \propto 1/K^3 \). Since both planets orbit stars of the same mass and have similar masses, the ratio of their orbital periods depends only on the ratio of their RV semi-amplitudes.

Given:
- \( K_1 = 5 \) milliangstroms (Planet #1),
- \( K_2 = 7 \) milliangstroms (Planet #2),

the ratio of their orbital periods is:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{K_1}{K_2}\right)^3 = \left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3 = \frac{125}{343} \approx 0.364.
\]

Thus, the orbital period of Planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of Planet #1, meaning it is shorter. Since the question asks how many times longer Planet #2's period is compared to Planet #1, the answer is approximately \( 0.36 \), corresponding to option A.
