Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me read through it carefully and try to figure out the right approach.

The question is about identifying the chemical formula of a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. The FTIR and 1H NMR spectra give me some clues about the structure.

First, the FTIR shows absorption peaks indicating an ester group. Esters have a carbonyl group (C=O), so that's a key functional group here. The presence of an ester suggests the compound has an ORCOOR structure or something similar.

Looking at the 1H NMR spectrum, there are six signals. Let me break down what each signal might correspond to:

1. Two signals for aromatic-H: Aromatic protons usually show up in the range of 6.5-8.5 ppm. Two signals could mean there are two different types of aromatic protons, perhaps because of substituents on the ring. Since it's a di-substituted ring, maybe the substituents are in positions that cause the aromatic protons to split into two sets. For example, in a para-substituted ring, the aromatic Hs would be in two sets, but since it's di-substituted, maybe it's meta or ortho. Wait, but wait, a di-substituted benzene would have different splitting depending on the substituents. Alternatively, perhaps the ring has substituents that cause two distinct environments for the Hs, like two substituents in such a way that the aromatic protons split into two sets. But I'm not entirely sure yet.

2. Two signals for vinyl-H: Vinyl protons are typically around 4.5-6.5 ppm. One is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets. A doublet suggests coupling with one neighboring proton, while a doublet of quartets might indicate coupling with two sets of protons. For example, in an ester group, the vinyl protons could be part of an ethyl group attached to an oxygen. Wait, like in an ethyl ester? Or maybe it's part of a substituent on the ring, such as a vinyl group attached elsewhere.

3. Two signals for –CH3 groups: These would be in the range of 0.9-1.5 ppm. Two signals could mean two different methyl groups, perhaps in different environments. If there's an ester group, maybe one methyl is part of the ester (like OCH2CH3), and another methyl is part of another substituent on the ring, like a methoxy group? Or perhaps another substituent like a methyl group attached directly.

Wait, the absence of signals for –CH2 groups is noted. So if there were any CH2 groups, we'd see signals for them, but none are present. So the structure doesn't have any CH2 groups. That suggests that any ethyl groups would be split into CH3 and something else, but perhaps in this case, it's not the case. Or maybe the ethyl is part of an ester, like OCH2CH3, but wait, in that case, the CH2 would be split into two protons, but maybe that's part of a larger structure that doesn't appear as a separate CH2 group.

Let me think about the possible structures. A di-substituted benzene with an ester group. So maybe it's something like phenyl acetate or another ester derivative.

Wait, but if the aromatic ring has two substituents, one of which is the ester group. Let's consider an example: Maybe the substituents are an ester group and another group, like a methyl group. So the ring has an ester substituent (like OAc) and a methyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a vinyl group attached as a substituent with an ester. Hmm, but I'm not sure yet. Let's think about the NMR signals.

The two aromatic H signals: Let's say the ring is di-substituted such that the substituents are in positions that cause the ring Hs to be in two distinct environments. For example, if the substituents are in the para positions, then the aromatic Hs would be para to each substituent, but wait, di-substituted para would have two substituents across from each other, leading to two equivalent Hs on each side. Wait, no, if you have two substituents in the para positions, the ring might be symmetrical. But if the substituents are in meta positions, maybe the aromatic Hs would split into two different sets.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are in such a way that the ring has two types of aromatic Hs. For example, if one substituent is at position 1 and another at position 3, making it a meta arrangement, the aromatic Hs would be at positions 2,4,5,6, etc., which could split into two different sets.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are an ester group and a vinyl group. Wait, but the NMR shows vinyl Hs as two signals. Hmm. Wait, the vinyl Hs are a doublet and a doublet of quartets. Let me think about that. A doublet suggests coupling with one neighboring proton. A doublet of quartets would have more neighbors, perhaps two adjacent protons each coupling with two different sets.

Wait, maybe the vinyl group is part of an ester substituent. Like an ethenyl group attached via an ester. For example, something like a substituted ethyl ester attached to the ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an ester group and a vinyl group, but I'm not sure. Let me try to draw a possible structure.

Let's imagine the benzene ring has two substituents: one is an ester group (like -OOCR), and the other is a vinyl group (like -CH2CH2O- or something else). But I'm not quite getting it. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl group attached via an ester, such as -O-CO-CH2CH2-O-... No, that might not make sense.

Wait, another approach: the number of signals in the NMR. There are two aromatic Hs, which suggests that the aromatic ring has symmetry, making some Hs equivalent. For example, if the substituents are para, then the aromatic Hs might be split into two sets. For example, in para-substituted rings, the Hs ortho to substituents could be equivalent, and the meta Hs could be equivalent. Wait, no, in para substitution, the substituents are opposite each other. So the Hs adjacent to substituent A would be in one pair, and those adjacent to substituent B would be another pair. Wait, but if substituents are identical, the Hs would be equivalent. But in this case, the substituents are different: one is an ester group, the other is perhaps a methyl group.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are two different groups, making the ring have two different sets of equivalent aromatic Hs. So if we have substituents at positions 1 and 3 (meta), the Hs at position 2 might be one set, and the Hs at position 4 and 6 another set, but that's just a guess.

Alternatively, maybe the substituents are such that the ring has two distinct environments for the Hs, leading to two signals. For example, if one substituent is an electron-withdrawing group and the other is an electron-donating group, the ring could have different Hs.

But perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the ester group. An ester group has the structure R-O-CO-R'. The carbonyl is in the ester. So in the aromatic compound, one substituent is an ester, perhaps with an ethyl group attached via oxygen.

Wait, so if the substituent is an ester group, like OOCR, where R is an alkyl group. For example, ethyl ester: OCOCH2CH3. So then the ester group would have a methylene group (CH2) and a methyl group (CH3). But wait, the NMR doesn't show any CH2 signals. Hmmm, that's a problem. Because if there's an ethyl group in the ester, the CH2 would be present. But the absence of CH2 in the NMR suggests that maybe the R groups in the ester are such that there are no CH2 groups. So perhaps the ester is a methyl ester, like OCOCH3. But then the ester would only contribute a methyl group, which would be a singlet in the NMR. But in the NMR data, we have two signals for CH3, which could mean two different methyl groups. So maybe the ester is part of a larger structure.

Wait, another possibility: the substituent is a vinyl ester, like OCOCH2CH2-O-... Wait, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a benzoyl group, but that's stretching it.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is an ester group attached to a vinyl group. For example, the structure could be something like CH2=CH-O-CO-R, but I'm not sure.

Let me consider the number of protons. The NMR has two aromatic Hs, two vinyl Hs, and two CH3 Hs, totaling six signals. So each of these sets is split into two groups.

Wait, wait. Let me think about the structure again. The compound is a di-substituted benzene. So two substituents on the benzene ring.

Substituent 1: an ester group. Let's say it's an alkoxy carbonyl group, like O-CO-R, where R is an alkyl group.

Substituent 2: another group, perhaps a methyl group or another ester group? But wait, the problem states it's a di-substituted, so two substituents.

So substituent 1: O-CO-R.

Substituent 2: another group, perhaps a methyl group.

Now, the substituent's structure could affect the NMR signals.

If substituent 1 is O-CO-R, then let's think about R. If R is CH2CH3 (ethyl), then the ester would have a CH2CH3 group. The NMR would show a triplet for the CH2 (adjacent to O) and a triplet for the CH3 (if the CH2 is next to it). But the problem states there are no CH2 signals, so perhaps R is a methyl group. That way, substituent 1 would be O-CO-CH3, which is a methyl ester. Then, the NMR would have a singlet for the COOCH3 group's methyl, but in our case, there are two CH3 signals. Hmm, so perhaps substituent 2 is a methyl group attached to the ring, giving another CH3 signal elsewhere. But wait, that would make a total of two CH3 groups: one from the ester (COOCH3) and one from the methyl substituent (CH3 attached to the ring). So that would give two CH3 signals.

Wait, that makes sense. So substituent 1 is O-CO-CH3, and substituent 2 is CH3 attached directly to the ring. Then, the NMR would show two CH3 signals: one for the COOCH3 group (singlet) and another for the ring-attached CH3. But wait, the ring is a benzene ring, so a CH3 attached to the ring would be as a substituent, perhaps as a methyl group. But in that case, the CH3 would be attached to the ring, which is possible.

Wait, but wait. If substituent 2 is a CH3 group attached to the ring, then the ring would have a methyl group and an ester group as substituents. Let's see:

So the structure would be something like:

O
||
O-C-CH3
|
Ph-O-CO-CH3 and Ph-CH3, but I'm not sure about the exact structure.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the substituents are an ester group (like -O-CO-CH2CH3) and a vinyl group. But then the ethyl group would have CH2 and CH3, but the NMR doesn't show CH2 signals. So that can't be.

Hmm, maybe the substituent is not an ethyl group but a methyl group. So substituent 1 is O-CO-CH3 (methyl ester), and substituent 2 is a CH3 group on the ring. So then, the NMR would have a singlet for the COOCH3 group's CH3 and a singlet for the ring's CH3, but since they're in different environments, perhaps they show as two separate singlets. But wait, in the NMR data, the two CH3 signals are not specified as singlets. They could be any multiplicity.

Wait, the NMR description says there are two signals corresponding to –CH3 groups. It doesn't specify if they are singlets or something else. So perhaps substituent 1 is O-CO-CH2CH3, but then there would be CH2 groups, which the problem says are absent. So that can't be.

Wait, is there another possibility for substituent 1? Maybe substituent 1 is a phenyl ester. But that might complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps substituent 1 is an ester group with a vinyl group. Let's think of a structure where the ester is attached to a vinyl group.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl ester, like O-CO-CH2-CH2-O-R. No, that doesn't sound right. Alternatively, O-CO-CH2CH2-O- could be part of another group, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a group like O-CO-CH2-CH3, but that brings back the CH2 group, which we don't have NMR signals for. So that's a problem.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group but that would involve CH2s as well. Hmm.

This is getting a bit confusing. Let me try another approach. Let's think about the degrees of unsaturation to figure out the possible formula.

The options given are:

A) C11H14O2 → Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU): (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no X or N, for C11H14O2: (2*11 +2 -14)/2 = (24-14)/2 = 5. So 5 degrees: a benzene ring (3 DoU) plus an ester (which has a double bond in the carbonyl and an ether linkage, but ether is a single bond. Wait, the ester group is O-CO-O. So carbonyl is a double bond, which counts as one DoU. So benzene (3) + ester (1) → 4. But the formula gives DoU 5. So where's the fifth? Maybe a double bond elsewhere.

Wait, the problem says it's a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring, so the ring is benzene (3 DoU). The substituents could add another DoU, like a double bond.

So for option A: DoU of 5. Benzene is 3, ester is 1 (C=O), and perhaps a double bond in a substituent, like a vinyl group, adding another, making total 5.

Similarly, let's check other options.

B) C12H14O2 → DoU: (2*12 +2 -14)/2 = (26-14)/2=6.

C) C12H12O2 → DoU: (2*12 +2 -12)/2 = (26-12)/2=7.

D) C11H12O2 → DoU: (2*11+2 -12)/2 → (24-12)/2=6.

Hmm, the compound has a benzene ring (3 DoU), an ester group (1 DoU), and perhaps a double bond elsewhere (like a vinyl group) adding another DoU, making 5. So option A (DoU 5) would fit that. Or option D (DoU 6) would have an extra DoU, perhaps a ring or another double bond.

Wait, but the NMR shows two vinyl protons. So that suggests a vinyl group (a double bond) is present. So that's another DoU. So benzene (3) + ester (1) + vinyl (1) → total 5. So the formula must have 5 DoU. So option A has 5, which would fit.

Wait, but let's calculate again. For option A, C11H14O2: DoU = [2*11 +2 -14]/2 = (24-14)/2=5. Correct. So that would fit.

But wait, the NMR shows two vinyl Hs, which suggests a double bond. So that's another DoU accounted for.

So the structure would have a benzene ring (3 DoU), an ester group (1 DoU from C=O), and a vinyl group (1 DoU), summing to 5 DoU. So option A has 5 DoU, which fits.

Now, let's think about the substituents. If the ring has two substituents: one is an ester group, and the other is a vinyl group attached as a substituent.

Wait, but the NMR shows two vinyl Hs. A vinyl group typically has two protons (like CH2=CH-). So perhaps the substituent is a vinyl ester. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl group connected in a way that it's part of the ester.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is an ester group attached via a vinyl group. For example, the substituent could be a -O-CO-CH2-CH2-O- group, but that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CO-O-C-CH2-CH2-O- structure, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the structure is such that the substituent is a vinyl group attached to the ester. For example, the ring has a substituent that is an ester with a vinyl group. So the structure might be O-CO-CH2-CH2-O-, but that's not right. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an allyl ester, like O-CO-CH2CH2CH2-O, but that's getting complicated.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a propenyl group as part of the ester. But let me try to think of a specific structure. Let's say the substituent is a group like O-CO-CH2-CH2-O-R, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl group attached to the ring, and the ester is another substituent.

Wait, let me imagine a structure where one substituent is an ester (like O-CO-R) and the other substituent is a vinyl group (like CH2=CH2-O- or similar). But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a group like CH2=CH-O-CO-R, but that's getting too speculative.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a benzoyl group, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a group like O-CO-CH2CH2-O-R, but that seems to involve CH2 groups, which the NMR doesn't show.

Hmm, this is getting a bit tangled. Let me think about the NMR data again. There are two vinyl Hs: one is a doublet (so maybe coupling with one neighbor), and the other is a doublet of quartets (coupling with two neighbors? Or perhaps each coupling with two different sets of Hs).

Wait, let's think of a vinyl group connected to an oxygen. For example, an ethylene glycol group: O-CH2-CH2-O. But that's a single bond, so no double bond. Alternatively, perhaps a vinyl ether: O-CH2-CH2-O with a double bond. No, wait, that's not possible because O is at the end. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a vinyl group attached to the ring. For example, the substituent is CH2=CH-O- attached to the ring, which would make the structure an aryl vinyl ether. But then, the ester would be another substituent.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a group like CH2=CH-CO-O-R attached to the ring. But that might complicate things.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propenyl group, like CH2=CH-CH2-O-CO-R. But again, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a benzyl group attached via an ester. Like O-CO-Ph-CH2-CH2-O, but again, I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an allyl ester. For example, the substituent is O-CO-CH2-CH2-CH2-O, but that doesn't have a double bond, so the vinyl Hs would be elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl group, like CH2=CH-O-CO-R.

Wait, but then the vinyl Hs would be on the CH2=CH-O- group. So the Hs on the CH2 and CH of the vinyl group would split into two signals.

In that case, the CH2 would be adjacent to the oxygen, and the CH would be adjacent to the double bond. But wait, in that structure, the CH2 would have two Hs, and the CH would have two Hs as well, but in a vinyl group, the CH2 is usually next to the double bond. Wait, no, in a vinyl group like CH2=CH-, the structure is CH2-CH2 with a double bond between the carbons. Wait, no, it's CH2=CH2, but that's ethylene. So in the structure CH2=CH-O-CO-R, the Hs on the CH2 would be deshielded and appear as a doublet, and the Hs on the CH would be next to the double bond, perhaps appearing as a triplet due to coupling with the adjacent CH2.

Wait, but in this scenario, the CH2 would be next to the oxygen, so their Hs would be split by the neighboring CH. So perhaps the CH2 would be a triplet (coupled with the CH), and the CH would be a doublet (coupled with the CH2). But according to the NMR data, one is a doublet and the other a doublet of quartets. Hmm, not sure if that fits.

Alternatively, perhaps the vinyl group is part of a substituent that is attached to the ring. For example, the substituent could be CH2=CH-O-CO-R, where R is a methyl group. Then, the CH2 would be adjacent to the oxygen and coupled with the CH.

Wait, but then in the NMR, the CH2 Hs would be a quartet (split by the neighboring CH which has two Hs), and the CH Hs would be a triplet (split by the CH2). But the NMR data says one is a doublet and the other a doublet of quartets. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: The vinyl group is part of an ester substituent. For example, the substituent is O-CO-CH2-CH2-O-. But that would have CH2 groups, which the NMR doesn't show. So that can't be.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a benzyl group attached via an ester. But that would have a CH2 group, which is not present.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is an ester with a vinyl group directly attached. Like O-CO-CH2-CH2-O-R, but again, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a group like O-CO-CH2-CH2-O-R, but that brings back the CH2 groups, which we don't have in the NMR.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a cyclopropane ring or something else, but that seems unrelated.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a methyl group and a vinyl group, but that doesn't seem to fit the NMR data.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a benzyl group, but that would have a CH2 group.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should consider the NMR signals:

- Two aromatic Hs. Let's think: The substituents are in such a way that the ring has two sets of equivalent Hs. For example, if the substituents are para, the ring Hs could be equivalent in two sets. But wait, para substituents would make the ring symmetric, leading to fewer signals. But the substituents might not be the same. For example, one substituent is an ester, the other is a methyl group. Then, the ring Hs would be in two different environments, leading to two signals.

- Two vinyl Hs. Let's imagine a substituent that's a vinyl group attached via an oxygen. For example, substituent is O-CO-CH2-CH2-O-R. Wait, no, because that would have CH2 groups.

Alternatively, substituent is O-CH2-CH2-O-CO-R. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl ester, like O-CO-CH2-CH2-O-R, but that again brings CH2 groups which aren't present in the NMR.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a propenyl group (CH2=CH-CH2-O-CO-R). But that would have CH2 groups.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an allyl ester, like O-CO-CH2-CH2-CH2-O-R, but again, CH2 groups would be present.

Hmm, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl group attached as part of an ester. For example, the substituent is O-CO-CH2-CH2-O-R. No, that's not right.

Wait, maybe I'm going about this the wrong way. Let's look at the number of protons each type contributes.

Aromatic Hs: two signals. So perhaps two sets of equivalent Hs, each with two protons each? Or maybe one set with two Hs and another with four? Or maybe one set with one H and another with three?

Wait, the NMR shows two signals for aromatic Hs. Let's say each signal corresponds to two Hs. So the aromatic ring has four Hs, two in each environment. Wait, but a benzene ring has six Hs. So if two substituents are present, the Hs would split into two or three sets, depending on substitution pattern.

Wait, di-substituted benzene: if substituents are para, then the ring has two sets of equivalent Hs: the two Hs adjacent to substituent A, and the two Hs adjacent to substituent B. So that's two sets, each with two Hs. That would give two signals in the NMR.

Wait, that makes sense. So substituent A and substituent B are in para positions. Each substituent is adjacent to two aromatic Hs, which are equivalent for each substituent.

So the aromatic ring would have two substituents, each in para positions, and the aromatic Hs would be in two sets, each with two Hs. So the NMR would have two signals for the aromatic Hs.

So substituent A is an ester group, and substituent B is another group, perhaps a methyl group.

So the structure would be para-substituted benzene with an ester group and a methyl group.

So substituent 1: ester group (O-CO-R)

Substituent 2: methyl group (-CH3)

So the structure would be something like:

O
||
O-CO-R attached at position 1, and CH3 at position 3 (meta) or position 4 (para).

Wait, but if substituent 1 is at position 1 and substituent 2 is at position 3, that's meta. Which would make the ring Hs split into two sets: Hs at positions 2,4,5,6. Wait, no, that might make more than two sets.

Wait, perhaps substituent 1 is at position 1 (ester group), substituent 2 is at position 4 (para), so the ring has substituents in positions 1 and 4.

In such a case, the aromatic Hs would be at positions 2,3,5,6.

But in para substitution on a benzene ring with two substituents, the Hs adjacent to substituent 1 would be positions 2 and 6, and those adjacent to substituent 4 would be positions 3 and 5. So the Hs at 2 and 6 would be equivalent, and the Hs at 3 and 5 would be equivalent. Thus, two sets of two Hs each. So the NMR would show two signals for aromatic Hs, each integrating for two Hs.

So that fits the NMR data.

Now, substituent 1 is the ester group. Let's say it's O-CO-R. R could be a methyl group, making it a methyl ester.

Substituent 2 is a methyl group.

So the structure would be benzene with OCOCH3 at position 1 and CH3 at position 4 (para).

So the formula would be CnHmO2. Let's count the carbons:

Benzene ring: 6 C.

O-CO-CH3: 3 C (O, C, O, and CH3). Wait, OCOCH3 is the ester group, so it's O-CO-OCH3? No, wait, the ester group is O-CO-R, where R is an alkyl group. So OCOCH3 is the ester group (methyl ester). So substituent 1 adds 2 C (the COOCH3 group has three C: the carbonyl C, the oxygen, and the methyl C). Wait, no, the ester group is O-CO-O-R? No, wait, esters are R-O-CO-R'. So substituent 1 would be O-CO-R', where R' is an alkyl group.

Wait, for the methyl ester, R' is CH3. So substituent 1 is O-CO-CH3, which contributes 2 C (the O is not counted as a C). So substituent 1 adds 2 C (the carbonyl C and the CH3 C).

Substituent 2 is CH3, adding another C.

So total C from substituents: 2 (ester) + 1 (methyl) = 3 C.

Plus the benzene ring's 6 C → total 9 C.

But looking at the options, the possible formulas are C11, C12, etc. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the substituent R in the ester group is more than just a methyl. Let's think: if substituent 1 is O-CO-R, where R is an ethyl group (CH2CH3), then substituent 1 would contribute 3 C (COOCH2CH3). Substituent 2 is CH3, contributing 1 C. Benzene is 6 C. Total C: 6 + 3 + 1 = 10 C. Hmm, but the options don't have C10.

Wait, perhaps the substituent R is a propyl group or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is not a methyl group but a larger group. Let's try substituent 1 as O-CO-CH2CH2-O-R, but that complicates things.

Wait, perhaps the substituent R is part of a larger structure, like a vinyl group. Let me try substituent 1 as O-CO-CH2CH2-O-R. No, that's getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl group attached to the ester. For example, substituent 1 is O-CO-CH2CH2O-, but that brings back CH2 groups which are not present.

Alternatively, perhaps substituent 1 is O-CO-CH2CH2-O-R, but that's not right.

Wait, maybe substituent 1 is O-CO-CH2CH2-O-R, but that would require R to be something else, adding more carbons.

Alternatively, perhaps substituent 1 is part of a larger ring structure, but that's probably beyond the scope here.

Wait, perhaps substituent 1 is O-CO-CH2CH2-O-R, but that would add more C.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Let's try to approach it differently. Let's look at the options and see which one fits the data.

The options are:

A) C11H14O2 → DoU 5.

B) C12H14O2 → DoU 6.

C) C12H12O2 → DoU 7.

D) C11H12O2 → DoU 6.

Earlier, I thought the structure should have 5 DoU (benzene:3, ester:1, vinyl:1), which fits option A (DoU 5). So let's focus on option A.

If the formula is C11H14O2, what would the structure look like?

The benzene ring has 6 C. The substituents would contribute 5 C, since 6 + 5 = 11.

So substituent 1 and substituent 2 together contribute 5 C.

Substituent 1 is the ester group, which would contribute, say, 3 C (like O-CO-CH2CH2-O-R is not possible because of CH2. So perhaps substituent 1 is O-CO-CH2CH3 (ethyl ester), which contributes 3 C: the carbonyl C, the oxygen, and CH2CH3 (2 C). Substituent 2 is a methyl group, contributing 1 C. Wait, 3 +1 =4, but we need 5. So that's not enough.

Alternatively, substituent 1 is O-CO-CH2CH2-O-R, but that's not an ester and would have more C.

Wait, maybe substituent 1 is O-CO-CH2CH2-O-R, but that's not an ester. Alternatively, perhaps substituent 1 is O-CO-CH2CH2-O-R, but that's a carbonate group, not an ester.

Hmm, perhaps substituent 1 is O-CO-CH2CH2CH3 (propyl ester), which contributes 4 C (COOCH2CH2CH3). Substituent 2 is CH3, contributing 1 C. So 4 +1 =5, which adds to the benzene's 6 → 6+5=11 C. That would fit option A.

So the structure would be a para-substituted benzene with OCOCH2CH2CH3 and a CH3 group as substituents.

Wait, but the NMR data shows no CH2 groups. Because substituent 1 is a propyl ester, it has two CH2 groups. Their protons would show up as signals in the NMR, but the question states there are no CH2 signals. So that can't be.

Ah, so that's a problem. So substituent 1 cannot have any CH2 groups. So perhaps substituent 1 is a methyl ester (OCOCH3), contributing 2 C. Then substituent 2 must contribute 3 C to reach 5. But substituent 2 is a substituent on the ring, so it can't be a group with 3 C unless it's a larger substituent, which complicates things.

Alternatively, substituent 2 is another ester group, but that would mean more than two substituents, which the problem states is di-substituted.

Hmm, this is tricky. Let me think again about the NMR data.

The NMR shows two aromatic Hs, two vinyl Hs, and two CH3s. No CH2s. So if substituent 1 is an ester group with a methyl group (OCOCH3), then substituent 2 must be a group that doesn't introduce any CH2s and contributes to the structure.

Wait, substituent 2 could be a vinyl group. Let's say substituent 2 is a vinyl group attached to the ring. So the structure is benzene with OCOCH3 and a vinyl group as substituents.

So substituent 1: OCOCH3 (methyl ester).

Substituent 2: CH2=CH- attached to the ring.

But wait, the vinyl group would have two Hs. So the NMR would show two vinyl Hs, which matches the data.

So the structure would be benzene with OCOCH3 at position 1 and CH2=CH- attached at position 4 (para). But wait, a vinyl group as a substituent would have more than two Hs. Let me think.

Wait, the vinyl group is CH2=CH-, which has two CH2 groups? No, wait, the vinyl group is CH2=CH-, with the double bond between the two CH groups. So the substituent is -CH2CH2-, but that's a single bond. Or perhaps it's -CH2-CH2- with a double bond.

Wait, no, the vinyl group is CH2=CH-, attached to the ring. So the substituent is -CH2-CH2- with a double bond between the two CH2 groups. No, that's not possible. Alternatively, the substituent is -CH2-CH2- with a double bond, but that's not right.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl group, which is -CH2-CH2- with a double bond. No, that's not correct. The vinyl group is CH2=CH- attached to the ring. So the substituent is a -CH2-CH2- group with a double bond between the two CH2 groups. Wait, that would make it a trans or cis arrangement.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH2- group with a double bond, making it a vinyl group. So the substituent is -CH2-CH2- with double bond, but that would be a single substituent.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me clarify:

A vinyl group is a substituent where there's a double bond adjacent to the point of attachment. For example, if the substituent is -CH2-CH2-, that's a single bond. But a vinyl group would be -CH2-CH2 with a double bond between the two CH2 groups. No, that's not correct. A vinyl group is a substituent where the double bond is directly attached to the ring. For example, in styrene, the substituent is -CH2-CH2-CH2- with a double bond between the first and second carbon, so it's CH2=CH- attached to the ring.

Wait, no, styrene is benzene with a vinyl group: benzene ring connected to CH2=CH2. So the substituent is -CH2-CH2 with a double bond between the two CH2 groups. So the substituent is -CH2-CH2 with a double bond, making it a vinyl group: -CH2-CH2.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is -CH2-CH2 with a double bond, making it a vinyl group.

So if the substituent is a vinyl group, the structure would be benzene ring with a substituent -CH2-CH2- with a double bond, so it's -CH2-CH2- but with a double bond, making it a vinyl group.

But then, the substituent would have two CH2 groups, which would show up in the NMR as -CH2- signals, but the problem states there are no CH2 signals. So that can't be.

Hmm, this is getting too complicated. Maybe I should try to look for the correct option based on the data.

The NMR shows two CH3 signals, which suggests two different methyl groups. These could be a methyl ester (COOCH3) and a methyl substituent (CH3 attached to the ring). So substituent 1 is OCOCH3 and substituent 2 is CH3.

So the structure would be benzene with OCOCH3 (ester) and CH3 (methyl) substituents in para positions.

Now, let's calculate the formula.

Benzene: 6 C.

OCOCH3: 3 C (O, C=O, CH3).

CH3: 1 C.

Total C: 6 +3 +1 =10 C.

But the options don't have C10. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps substituent 1 is more than just OCOCH3. Maybe the ester group is part of a larger substituent. For example, substituent 1 could be OCOCH2CH3 (ethyl ester), which contributes 4 C (O, C=O, CH2, CH3).

Then substituent 2 is CH3, contributing 1 C.

So total C: 6 +4 +1 =11 C. Which matches option D: C11H12O2.

But wait, option D is C11H12O2. So let's check DoU.

DoU for option D: (2*11 +2 -12)/2 = (24-12)/2=6.

The structure would have benzene (3 DoU), ester (1 DoU), and no vinyl group. But the NMR shows two vinyl Hs, so that suggests a vinyl group, adding another DoU, making total 5. But option D has 6 DoU, which would require another DoU somewhere.

Hmm, perhaps the substituent includes a double bond. So if substituent 1 is OCOCH2CH3 (ethyl ester), which doesn't have a double bond, but substituent 2 is a vinyl group, then we have the ester (1 DoU) and vinyl (1 DoU), plus benzene (3) → 5 DoU. But the formula would then have 5 DoU, which matches option A.

Wait, let's recalculate the formula.

Benzene:6 C.

Substituent 1: OCOCH2CH3 → 4 C.

Substituent 2: CH2=CH- attached to the ring? No, that would add more C.

Wait, perhaps substituent 2 is a vinyl group, which is CH2=CH-. But that's only two C. So substituent 2 would contribute 2 C.

So total C:6 +4 +2=12 C.

Which would make the formula C12H14O2 (if substituent 1 is ethyl ester and substituent 2 is vinyl group). Let me see the DoU: benzene (3), ester (1), vinyl (1) → 5. So the formula would have 5 DoU. So which option is that?

Looking back, option A is C11H14O2 → DoU 5. Option B is C12H14O2 → DoU 6.

Wait, but substituent 2 in this case is a vinyl group (CH2=CH-) attached to the ring. So substituent 2 is -CH2-CH2 with a double bond, making it a vinyl group. So the substituent adds 2 C.

So substituent 1: OCOCH2CH3 → 4 C.

Substituent 2: CH2=CH- → 2 C.

Total:6+4+2=12 C → formula is C12H14O2. Which is option B. DoU is 6: benzene (3) + ester (1) + vinyl (1) + any other rings?

Wait, no, substituent 2 is a vinyl group, which is a double bond, so that's one DoU. So total DoU is 5. But option B has 6 DoU, which would require another DoU somewhere. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe substituent 2 is not a vinyl group but something else. Alternatively, perhaps the ester group has a double bond elsewhere.

I'm getting stuck here. Let me try another approach. The NMR shows two vinyl Hs. So perhaps the substituent includes a double bond. Let's say substituent 1 is OCOCH2CH2-O-R, but that brings CH2 groups, which are not present.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl ester, like O-CO-CH2CH2-O-R, but again, CH2 groups would be present.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a cyclopropane ring, which doesn't involve CH2 groups. But that's a stretch.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an aromatic group, but that's not indicated.

Hmm. At this point, I think the correct formula is option A: C11H14O2, but I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps option D: C11H12O2.

Wait, let's think about the number of Hs. The formula would have a certain number of Hs based on the structure.

If the structure is benzene with two substituents: OCOCH3 and CH3, then the formula would be C9H8O2. But that's not an option.

Wait, but the substituents could be larger. For example, substituent 1 is OCOCH2CH2O-R, but that complicates things.

Alternatively, perhaps substituent 1 is OCOCH2CH2CH3 (propyl ester). So substituent 1 contributes 4 C (COOCH2CH2CH3). Substituent 2 is CH3, contributing 1 C. Benzene:6 C. Total:6+4+1=11 C. So formula is C11H14O2 (option A). 

Now, checking Hs:

Benzene: 4 Hs (since two substituents would take away two Hs each in para positions, leaving four Hs).

Substituent 1 (OCOCH2CH2CH3): the ester group has CH2CH2CH3, which has 2*(2 Hs) from CH2 groups and 3 Hs from CH3. But the NMR doesn't show any CH2 signals. So that's a problem.

Hmm, perhaps substituent 1 is OCOCH3 (methyl ester), substituent 2 is CH2=CH-O-R. But that brings CH2 groups.

Wait, I'm not making progress. Given the time I've spent, I think the best approach is to conclude that the correct formula is option A: C11H14O2.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves identifying the chemical formula of a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound based on FTIR and 1H NMR data. The FTIR spectrum indicates the presence of an ester group, while the 1H NMR spectrum shows six signals: two aromatic protons, two vinyl protons (one doublet and one doublet of quartets), and two methyl protons, with no signals corresponding to CH2 groups.

### Key Observations and Analysis:
1. **FTIR Spectrum**: The presence of an ester group (C=O) is confirmed.
2. **1H NMR Spectrum**:
   - Two aromatic protons suggest a para-substituted benzene ring, where the substituents create two distinct environments for the aromatic protons.
   - Two vinyl protons indicate the presence of a double bond, likely part of a vinyl group attached to the ring.
   - Two methyl protons suggest the presence of two distinct methyl groups, possibly from a methyl ester and a methyl substituent on the ring.
   - The absence of CH2 signals implies that the structure does not contain any CH2 groups.

3. **Structure Consideration**:
   - The compound is a di-substituted benzene with one substituent being an ester group (e.g., OCOCH3) and the other being a methyl group (-CH3) in para positions.
   - The ester group contributes to the molecular formula, and the absence of CH2 groups rules out larger alkyl groups like ethyl or propyl esters.

4. **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**:
   - The benzene ring contributes 3 DoU.
   - The ester group contributes 1 DoU (from the C=O bond).
   - The vinyl group contributes 1 DoU.
   - Total DoU = 5, which matches the formula **C11H14O2**.

5. **Chemical Formula**:
   - The benzene ring contributes 6 carbons.
   - The ester group (e.g., OCOCH3) contributes 3 carbons.
   - The methyl substituent contributes 1 carbon.
   - Total carbons = 6 + 3 + 1 = 10. However, the correct formula is **C11H14O2**, suggesting the ester group may involve a slightly larger substituent.

### Conclusion:
The compound is a para-substituted benzene with an ester group and a methyl group, consistent with the data provided. The correct chemical formula is **C11H14O2**.
