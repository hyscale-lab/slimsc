Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let me try to work through it. The question is about selecting the right reagents for two reactions. Hmm, let's start by breaking down each part.

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to form 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? So it's a ketone. When a ketone reacts with sodium cyanide, that's like a nucleophilic addition, I think. Oh wait, but ketones don't typically react with HCN or CN- under normal conditions unless... wait, maybe it's a specific reaction. Oh right! I think it's the formation of a cyanohydrin. Yeah, that's it. So the cyanide ion acts as a nucleophile and adds to the carbonyl group, and then probably something else happens.

Wait, but to form a cyanohydrin, the reagent is usually HCN, right? Because NaCN in acidic conditions—like maybe H3O+ is involved. Oh wait, the reaction is butan-2-one + NaCN + A. But NaCN is a source of CN- ions. So for the cyanohydrin formation, we need an acid catalyst, I think. So maybe reagent A is something acidic, like H3O+.

So the first reaction: ketone + NaCN in acidic conditions. That would protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making it more electrophilic. Then the CN- attacks, and then the proton is transferred, leading to the formation of the cyanohydrin. So in this case, A is H3O+. Looking at the options, options A and B have A as H3O+.

The second reaction is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile plus reagent B (H2O) giving 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. Wait, so the nitrile group is turning into a carboxylic acid. How does that happen?

Nitriles can be oxidized to carboxylic acids, right? So what's the typical reagent for that? I remember that under acidic conditions with hot H2O, maybe H2O and a strong acid. Or perhaps using a mixture with KMnO4 or another oxidizing agent. Alternatively, maybe it's hydrolysis under strong acidic conditions.

Wait, but looking at the reagents given. The question says that reagent B is H2O. Wait, no, the problem says the second reaction uses B (H2O). Oh, wait, no, the second reaction is with reagent B, which is H2O. Wait, no, the description says "2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H2O)"—oh wait, no, B is the reagent, and the reaction is in H2O. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me read again.

Ah, no, the question says: "2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H2O) ---> ...". So the reaction uses B, and the solvent is H2O. So reagent B is something that is added along with water. Or maybe B is the reagent in water.

Wait, but the product is a carboxylic acid. So the nitrile is being oxidized. Common oxidizing agents for nitriles to carboxylic acids are things like KMnO4 under acidic conditions, perhaps with heating. Alternatively, using HCl and heat with the nitrile in a solution, but that usually gives an amide or something else. Wait, another possibility: maybe it's a hydrolysis followed by oxidation.

Wait, perhaps the nitrile is first hydrolyzed to an amide, which is then further oxidized. But no, the product is a carboxylic acid, so maybe it's a two-step reaction.

Alternatively, maybe the nitrile is treated with H2O and an acid. Wait, nitrile hydrolysis in acidic conditions usually gives a carboxylic acid, right? But wait, nitrile hydrolysis can be done under acidic or basic conditions. Let me think: in acidic conditions, H2O with H+ (like H3O+ or HCl), the nitrile would hydrolyze to a carboxylic acid, correct? So if the nitrile is treated with water and an acid, that would form the acid.

Wait, but in the first reaction, A is H3O+. So for the second reaction, reagent B is something that, when added to H2O, would provide the necessary conditions. Let me see the options. The options for B are either HCl or CH3COOH. So if the second reaction is in H2O, but what's added as B?

Wait, the product is a carboxylic acid. So the nitrile is being oxidized to a carboxylic acid. So perhaps the reagent is an acid, like HCl. Because H2O with HCl would provide the acidic conditions needed for the hydrolysis of the nitrile to the acid.

Wait, but nitrile hydrolysis under acidic conditions generally uses H3O+ or HCl. So perhaps B is HCl. Let me check the options. Option A says B is HCl. Option C says B is HCl as well, but their A is NaHSO3.

Wait, but wait another possibility: sometimes, when you have a nitrile group adjacent to an alcohol group, like in the starting material, hydrolysis might not be straightforward. The starting material is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, no, in the second reaction, the starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. So the structure is something like:

HO-C(CH2CH3)(CN)Ph group. Wait, perhaps the nitrile is at a position where it can't easily undergo hydrolysis, but maybe under acidic conditions, it can still do so.

Alternatively, perhaps in the presence of H2O and an acid, the nitrile is hydrolyzed to a carboxylic acid. So if B is HCl, that would provide the acidic environment needed.

Looking at the options again:

Option A: A = H3O+, B = HCl.

Option C: A = NaHSO3, B = HCl.

So which one is correct?

Wait, but the first reaction uses NaCN and A, which is H3O+ for option A and C uses NaHSO3. Wait, what's the role of A in the first reaction? It's a proton source for the cyanohydrin formation. So I thought A is H3O+.

So the first reagent A is H3O+ because the reaction is acid-catalyzed. So the correct options are A and B for the first part.

Now, for the second reaction, the reagent B is in an aqueous solution. So if the nitrile is to become a carboxylic acid, perhaps B is HCl to make it acidic. So option A has B as HCl.

Wait, option A: A is H3O+ and B is HCl.

That would make both reactions work.

Alternatively, could B be CH3COOH? Because option B's B is CH3COOH.

Wait, but CH3COOH is a weaker acid. Would that be sufficient for the hydrolysis of the nitrile to acid?

Alternatively, maybe the second reaction isn't a hydrolysis but an oxidation. Wait, the product is a carboxylic acid, which is a higher oxidation state than nitrile.

Wait, nitriles can be oxidized to amides, then to carboxylic acids. But what conditions do that? KMnO4 under strong acidic conditions.

Wait, but the options don't have KMnO4. So perhaps the reaction is a hydrolysis, turning nitrile to acid via an intermediate amide or something else.

Wait, perhaps the second reaction is using H2O with an acid catalyst. So if B is HCl, then the solution is acidic, and the nitrile would hydrolyze to the carboxylic acid.

So in that case, option A would have the correct reagents.

Let me think again. The first reaction uses H3O+ (A) as the acid catalyst for the cyanohydrin formation. The second reaction uses HCl (B) as the acid in water to hydrolyze the nitrile to the acid.

So the correct option would be option A.

The first reaction involves the formation of a cyanohydrin from butan-2-one (a ketone) and NaCN. This reaction requires an acid catalyst to protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making it more electrophilic, and facilitate the nucleophilic attack by CN⁻. Among the options, H₃O⁺ (A) is the correct reagent for this purpose, as it provides the necessary acidic conditions.

The second reaction involves the conversion of a nitrile group into a carboxylic acid. This typically requires hydrolysis under acidic conditions. The product indicates that the nitrile is oxidized to a carboxylic acid, which can be achieved by treating the compound with water (H₂O) and an acid. Among the options, HCl (B) is the appropriate reagent, as it provides the acidic environment needed for the hydrolysis.

Thus, the correct reagents for the two reactions are A = H₃O⁺ and B = HCl.
