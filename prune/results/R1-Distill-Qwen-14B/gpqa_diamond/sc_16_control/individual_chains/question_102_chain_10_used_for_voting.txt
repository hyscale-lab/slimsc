Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this science question. It's a bit complicated, but I'll take it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question involves a ligand-receptor pair expressed in neural crest cells. The main goal is to understand their developmental fate. The researcher has created a bicistronic vector with these two constructs. Bicistronic means it has two coding regions in one vector, right? So each gene is expressed separately, probably under different promoters or something.

Looking at the setup: the ligand ORF is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry, and the receptor ORF is at the 3' end, fused to eGFP. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, which I think is a strong promoter used for expression. The receptor has an IRES upstreamâ€”that's an internal ribosome entry site, which allows for the expression of a second gene in a bicistronic construct. So the ligand and receptor are both expressed, but perhaps in a way that they're co-expressed but independently regulated.

Between the ligand ORF and mCherry, there's a stop cassette with loxP. Same with the receptor and eGFP, which has a lox2272 stop cassette. So, these are stop signals that prevent expression unless the appropriate Cre is present to excise them.

The researcher made antibodies against the overexpressed proteins and did a Western blot. The blot uses total proteins, and the signal correlates with actin loading, so that's a good control for loading. But when they checked the expression, I'm guessing the blot might not have shown the expected signals, but the question isn't about that. Instead, the mouse model was made, and the offspring were crossed with SOX10-Cre.

Wait, what's the purpose of SOX10-Cre? SOX10 is a transcription factor involved in neural crest development. Using Cre would mean that in the areas where SOX10 is expressed, the loxP sites would be excised. So if the vector has loxP and lox2272 sites, maybe the SOX10-Cre would only act on one of them.

Wait, the ligand is at 5' with a loxP-stop-loxP before mCherry. The receptor is at 3' with a lox2272-stop-lox2272 before eGFP. So, in the vector, the ligand and receptor are each under their own stop cassettes, and Cre is needed to remove them.

But the vector is bicistronic, so the ligand is expressed under the CBA promoter, then the IRES starts the receptor. So the ligand and receptor should be expressed together, but the eGFP and mCherry are only expressed if the stops are removed.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The vector is a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. So, the construct is designed such that the ligand is first, then the stop, then an IRES, then the receptor with its own stop.

Wait, no. The vector is set up as ligand ORF (with CBA promoter) followed by a stop cassette (loxP-stop-loxP), then IRES, then receptor ORF, then stop cassette (lox2272-stop-lox2272), then eGFP.

So, without Cre, the stop cassettes prevent expression of mCherry and eGFP. But when Cre is present, the stop cassettes are excised, so the mCherry and eGFP should be expressed as fusion proteins with ligand and receptor.

Wait, no, perhaps the ligand is fused to mCherry, so the stop is between them. So ligand ORF is followed by a stop cassette. Then, perhaps the IRES allows for the expression of the receptor, which is fused to eGFP, with a stop cassette as well.

Wait, maybe the setup is that the vector has two separate expression cassettes? Or is it a single transcript with two ORFs?

Bicistronic vectors typically have two ORFs in a single transcript, separated by an IRES or a 2A peptide. So perhaps the first ORF is ligand, followed by mCherry? No, the ligand ORF is 5', fused to mCherry, but with a stop in between. Hmm, maybe I need to clarify.

Wait, the ligand ORF is 5', and it's fused to mCherry, but there's a stop cassette between them. So the ligand is expressed, but when Cre is present, the stop is removed, allowing the mCherry to be expressed as part of the same reading frame? Or maybe the ligand and mCherry are on separate cassettes.

Wait, perhaps the bicistronic vector has two separate expression units. The first is ligand under CBA promoter, with a stop cassette that includes loxP sites. The second unit is the receptor under IRES, with a stop cassette using lox2272.

So, when the Cre is introduced, which Cre variant is used? Because the vector has loxP and lox2272. Cre can recognize loxP sites, but lox2272 is a variant that requires a different recombinase, like Dre or another variant. But Cre might not cut lox2272.

So in the vector, the ligand's stop cassette is flanked by loxP sites. The receptor's stop is flanked by lox2272. So when you introduce Cre, which can only cut loxP, it will excise the ligand's stop cassette. But the receptor's stop cassette (lox2272) won't be affected by Cre. So the ligand's stop is removed, allowing mCherry to be expressed. But the receptor's stop remains, so eGFP won't be expressed.

But the question says that the mouse model is homozygous for the construct, and they crossed it to SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice. SOX10-Cre would express Cre under the control of SOX10, which is active in neural crest cells.

So in the offspring, the Cre should excise the loxP sites in the ligand's stop cassette, allowing mCherry to be expressed. But the eGFP would still be behind the lox2272 stop cassette, which Cre can't cut. So in the mouse, the ligand would be expressed with mCherry, but the receptor would remain with the stop cassette, so eGFP isn't expressed.

But the question is about why no green signal is seen under the confocal. eGFP is supposed to be expressed only if the receptor's stop cassette is excised. But in this setup, Cre can't excise the lox2272 sites. So the eGFP isn't expressed.

But the experiment is about the interaction between ligand and receptor. So perhaps the researcher expects the receptor-eGFP to be expressed in the same cells as the ligand-mCherry. But if the eGFP isn't expressed, then when they look under the microscope, they don't see the green signal.

Wait, the question is about the mouse model. The mouse is homozygous for the construct. So both alleles have the same vector. Then, they crossed with SOX10-Cre. So Cre would be expressed in neural crest cells (since SOX10 is involved in their development). So in those cells, the Cre would go into the construct and excise the loxP stop cassette in the ligand ORF, allowing the ligand-mCherry to be expressed. But the receptor's stop is in lox2272, which Cre can't cut. So the receptor is expressed only if the stop is removed, but in this case, it remains.

So after crossing, the mice would have the ligand expressed (since the stop is removed) and the receptor not expressed, because the stop is still there. But wait, perhaps the construct is designed so that both the ligand and receptor are expressed only when their respective stops are removed.

So the ligand is under CBA, which is a promoter that is strong and constitutive. The receptor is under an IRES, which is after the ligand, meaning that the receptor's expression is dependent on the IRES, perhaps a weaker promoter or only in certain conditions.

But the key point is that the eGFP is downstream of the receptor ORF, but the stop cassette (lox2272) isn't excised because Cre can't cut that. So eGFP isn't expressed, which is why there's no green signal.

Wait, but the question is about the receptor-eGFP. The researcher probably expects that when Cre is present, the stop cassettes are removed, allowing both mCherry and eGFP to be expressed. But in reality, only the ligand's stop is removed. So the receptor is still under a stop, so eGFP isn't expressed.

So when they look under the microscope, they expect to see eGFP in the cells where the receptor is expressed, but they don't. So why?

Looking at the options:

Option A: ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship. Paracrine means they act on nearby cells. But this doesn't directly explain the lack of eGFP expression.

Option B: the receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi. That would cause improper trafficking, but eGFP is a reporter, so if it's not made, it won't be in the Golgi. Or maybe if the construct isn't processed, but I'm not sure.

Option C: the enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing. But the ligand is under CBA, which is a strong promoter. If the enhancer was missing, perhaps expression would be low, but the researcher used antibodies, so expression may have been confirmed.

Option D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. If the stop cassette wasn't excised, the receptor would be expressed as a fusion with eGFP, but if the reading frame is off, the eGFP wouldn't be functional, but you might still get some expression. Alternatively, the stop might be causing the eGFP not to be expressed. But in this case, the stop is in the way.

Wait, but the problem is that the eGFP isn't expressed. So the stop cassette remains, so the eGFP isn't made. So why is the stop not being removed? Because the Cre can't cut the lox2272 sites. So the eGFP is still behind a stop cassette that Cre can't remove.

So the issue is that the Cre can only remove the loxP sites, not the lox2272. Therefore, the eGFP remains behind the stop. So the construct wasn't properly designed to allow both stops to be removed by Cre.

Wait, but the question says that the mouse is homozygous for the construct. So both alleles have both stops. Then, when crossed with SOX10-Cre, which is active in neural crest, the Cre would only remove the loxP stops on both alleles, but the lox2272 stops would remain. So the ligand expression would be on, but the receptor wouldn't be expressed because the stop remains.

But wait, the question says the ligand is under CBA and the receptor under IRES. So perhaps the ligand is expressed, but the receptor is only expressed if the IRES allows, but the stop after the receptor prevents eGFP.

Wait, but in the vector, the ligand is at 5' with a stop, then the IRES, then the receptor with its own stop. So without Cre, the ligand is expressed but the mCherry is not (because the stop is in the way). The IRES allows the receptor to be translated, but the eGFP is under a stop. With Cre, the ligand's stop is cut, so the ligand and mCherry are expressed. The receptor's stop is not cut, so the eGFP isn't expressed.

But what's the purpose of the eGFP? To track where the receptor is expressed. If the eGFP isn't expressed, you can't see the receptor's location.

So after the cross, they look for eGFP expression in the offspring. They don't see any green, which suggests that the eGFP isn't being expressed. The most likely reason is that the stop cassette in front of the eGFP wasn't removed, so the eGFP isn't expressed.

Why wasn't it removed? Because the lox2272 sites aren't cut by Cre. So the vector uses different lox sites for the two stops, but only the loxP ones are cut. So the eGFP's stop remains.

But the options don't directly state this. Let's look at the options again.

Option D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. That would lead to a frame-shift, but if the stop is present, the eGFP wouldn't be expressed at all. But without the stop being removed, the eGFP isn't made, regardless of frame.

Wait, perhaps the eGFP isn't being expressed because the stop is in the way, so the mRNA is not translated. So the presence of the stop prevents the expression of eGFP. The reason the stop isn't removed is because the lox2272 isn't cut by Cre. But the options don't talk about the lox sites.

Looking at the options, which one would explain the absence of eGFP.

Option D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. If the stop isn't removed, the eGFP won't be expressed. But if the stop is removed, but the coding is out of frame, the eGFP won't be expressed either. But if the stop is still present, the frame doesn't matter because the stop blocks translation.

Wait, perhaps the stop cassette (with lox2272) was not correctly placed, so when the vector is designed, the stop is between the receptor and eGFP, preventing eGFP expression even if the stop is removed. Alternatively, the reading frame may not allow eGFP to be expressed.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is D. Because when the lox2272 isn't cut, the stop remains. But if the construct was made incorrectly, the eGFP could be in a different frame than the receptor, leading to no expression. But in this case, the stop is the main issue.

Wait, maybe the IRES is not working correctly. The IRES is for the receptor. If the IRES isn't functional, the receptor won't be expressed, so eGFP won't be either.

Alternatively, perhaps the stop cassettes are preventing expression. The ligand's stop is correctly removed, but the receptor's stop isn't, so the eGFP isn't expressed.

So, looking at the options, the issue is that the eGFP isn't expressed because the stop isn't removed. But the question is about why.

Option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. If the stop is in place, the mRNA for the receptor would stop before eGFP, so eGFP isn't made. Only when the stop is removed would the eGFP be expressed. So if the stop remains, eGFP isn't expressed.

But the issue is the stop isn't being removed because Cre can't cut the lox2272 sites. However, none of the options directly address this.

Wait, looking at the options again:

Option D: The receptor and the eGFP are not in the frame. That would mean that when the stop is removed, the receptor and eGFP are not in the same reading frame, so eGFP isn't expressed. But in reality, the stop is still present, so the eGFP isn't expressed regardless.

Wait, perhaps the vector's design is such that the stop is between the receptor and eGFP, so when the stop is removed, the receptor and eGFP are in the same reading frame. But if they're not, then even if the stop is removed, eGFP isn't expressed.

So in the question, the researcher didn't see any eGFP signal. The possible reasons are:

A) The ligand and receptor are in paracrine, meaning they act on other cells. But this doesn't explain why the eGFP isn't expressed in the same cell.

B) The receptor-eGFP is stuck in the Golgi. If it's stuck, you might not see eGFP in the cell. But why would it be stuck? Maybe the construct has a signal peptide that misdirects it. But if the eGFP isn't made, it won't be anywhere.

C) The enhancer is missing. Without an enhancer, the promoter might not work. But the ligand is under CBA, which is a strong promoter; perhaps the receptor's expression isn't sufficient.

D) The receptor and eGFP are not in frame. If the stop is in place, the eGFP isn't expressed. But if the stop is removed, but the frame is wrong, eGFP isn't expressed either.

But in the experiment, Cre is introduced, which should only remove the ligand's stop. The receptor's stop remains, so eGFP isn't expressed. So the absence of eGFP is because the stop isn't removed.

But looking at the options, none directly address the lox sites. So among the options given, which one is the correct reason?

Another angle: the construct is a bicistronic vector, so both the ligand and receptor are expressed. The ligand is expressed with mCherry, but the eGFP is not. So, the problem is that the eGFP isn't expressed.

If the vector is designed so that the stop cassettes are between the ligand and mCherry, and between the receptor and eGFP, and the Cre is only able to remove the ligand's stop, then the ligand and mCherry are expressed, but the receptor and eGFP are not.

But the researcher is using SOX10-Cre, which should remove the stop in the ligand, allowing mCherry expression. But the eGFP remains unexpressed because the stop is not cut.

But the question is why the eGFP isn't expressed. The problem is that the lox2272 sites aren't cut by Cre, so the stop remains, preventing eGFP expression.

But the options don't have an option about lox sites. So I have to choose among the given options.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Paracrine. Doesn't explain eGFP absence.

Option B: Receptor stuck in Golgi. Doesn't explain why it's not expressed.

Option C: Missing enhancer. If the enhancer is missing, the ligand and receptor might not be expressed, but the ligand is under CBA, which is strong.

Option D: Receptor and eGFP not in frame. If the stop is present, eGFP isn't expressed regardless of frame. So the main issue is the stop, not the frame.

Wait, but if the stop is removed, whether the frame is correct determines if eGFP is expressed. But in this case, the stop remains, so eGFP isn't expressed.

So the correct answer isn't about the frame but about the stop not being removed. So perhaps the correct answer is not among the options. But I have to choose from A to D.

Wait, maybe the issue is that the IRES isn't allowing the receptor to be expressed. The IRES is supposed to drive the expression of the receptor. If the IRES isn't functional, then the receptor isn't expressed, so eGFP isn't either.

But why would the IRES not be functional? That's not one of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the eGFP is not properly cloned, leading to no expression. But that's more a technical issue.

Wait, the problem states that the antibodies were raised against the overexpressed proteins, so presumably the ligand and receptor are expressed. But the Western blot after transfection showed signals proportional to actin, so I guess the proteins are expressed. But in the mouse, the eGFP isn't expressed.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the vector is only expressing the ligand and mCherry, not the receptor and eGFP, because the receptor's stop isn't cut. So the eGFP isn't expressed because the stop remains.

But why isn't the stop cut? Because the Cre can't cut lox2272. But the options don't mention that.

So looking at the options, the only one that could explain the eGFP not being expressed is D: the receptor and eGFP are not in the same frame, so when the stop is removed, the eGFP isn't expressed.

But wait, in the actual setup, the stop is still present, so the eGFP isn't expressed regardless of frame.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The only option that makes sense is D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. If the stop is present, the eGFP isn't expressed. But if the stop is removed but the frame is wrong, then eGFP isn't expressed.

But in this case, the stop is present, so the eGFP isn't expressed, regardless of frame. So perhaps the correct answer is D.

Alternatively, perhaps the vector's design has the stop after the receptor, so when it's removed, the eGFP is expressed in frame with the receptor.

But if the stop isn't removed, eGFP isn't expressed. So the underlying issue is that the stop isn't removed. But the options don't have that.

So, perhaps the correct answer is D. Because when the stop is removed, the eGFP isn't in frame, so it's not expressed.

But why would the frame be an issue only when the stop is removed? Because without the stop, the receptor is expressed, and the eGFP should be in frame.

Wait, perhaps the stop is between the receptor and eGFP, and when the stop is removed, the eGFP is in frame. So if the stop remains, the eGFP isn't expressed. But if the stop is removed and the frame is wrong, then even if the stop is gone, the eGFP isn't expressed.

In the case where the stop isn't removed, the eGFP isn't expressed regardless of frame.

In this problem, the stop isn't removed because Cre can't cut the lox2272 sites. So the eGFP isn't expressed. But none of the options directly address this.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is with the vector's design. The vector has a stop between ligand and mCherry, and a stop between receptor and eGFP. The ligand is under CBA, the receptor under IRES.

When Cre is introduced, it removes the loxP stops, allowing mCherry to be expressed with the ligand. But the IRES-driven receptor still has the lox2272 stop, which isn't cut. So the receptor and eGFP aren't expressed.

But the question is why the eGFP isn't expressed. The options don't include the issue with the lox2272, so perhaps the correct answer is D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. If the stop isn't removed, the eGFP isn't expressed, but if the stop is removed, the frame determines if eGFP is expressed.

But in the experiment, the stop isn't removed, so the eGFP isn't expressed. But the options don't directly address this, so perhaps the intended answer is D.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is that the vector uses IRES for the receptor, which may not be efficient, but that's not an option.

Another thought: the Western blot after transfection showed signals. Did the Western blot detect the eGFP? Probably not, because the stop remains. But in the mouse, the eGFP should be expressed if the stop is cut.

But the mouse is crossed with SOX10-Cre, which should remove the ligand's stop, but not the receptor's. So the ligand is expressed, but the receptor isn't.

So why didn't the eGFP express? Because the stop remains.

But the options don't directly say that. So perhaps the correct answer is D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. Because when the stop is removed, they are not in frame, so eGFP isn't expressed.

But in the mouse, the stop wasn't removed, so eGFP isn't expressed regardless. So I'm a bit stuck.

Given the options, the best fit seems to be D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves a bicistronic vector expressing a ligand and receptor, with the ligand under the CBA promoter and the receptor under an IRES element. The ligand ORF is fused to mCherry, with a loxP-stop-loxP cassette between them, while the receptor ORF is fused to eGFP, with a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette between them. The vector is introduced into a mouse model homozygous for the construct, which is then crossed with SOX10-Cre mice. Despite this, no green signal (eGFP) is observed under confocal microscopy.

Key points of analysis:

1. **Vector Design**: The ligand and receptor are co-expressed, but the eGFP expression depends on the removal of the lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette. SOX10-Cre can excise loxP sites but not lox2272 sites. Therefore, while the ligand and mCherry are expressed (as the loxP stop cassette is excised), the receptor and eGFP remain unexpressed due to the unexcised lox2272 stop cassette.

2. **Lack of eGFP Expression**: The absence of eGFP suggests that the stop cassette upstream of eGFP is not removed, preventing its expression. This is consistent with the fact that Cre cannot cut lox2272 sites, leaving the stop cassette intact.

3. **Option Analysis**:
   - **A) Paracrine relationship**: This does not explain the lack of eGFP expression, as the issue is with expression in the same cell, not the mode of signaling.
   - **B) Receptor-eGFP stuck in the Golgi**: This would not prevent eGFP from being expressed in the first place. If eGFP is not synthesized, it cannot be trafficked to the Golgi.
   - **C) Missing enhancer**: The ligand is under the strong CBA promoter, so enhancer activity is unlikely to be the issue.
   - **D) Receptor and eGFP not in frame**: If the stop cassette were removed, eGFP would need to be in frame with the receptor for proper expression. However, since the stop cassette remains, eGFP is not expressed regardless of the reading frame.

4. **Conclusion**: While the primary issue is that the lox2272 stop cassette is not excised by Cre, none of the options directly address this. Among the given options, the most plausible explanation is **D**, as it accounts for the possibility that even if the stop cassette were removed, eGFP might not be expressed due to a misreading frame.

Answer: D
