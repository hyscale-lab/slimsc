Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again and see what clues I can gather. 

The question is about identifying an unknown compound using FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry data. The options given are four different chemical formulas with varying degrees of unsaturation and oxygen content. 

First, I'll look at the FTIR data. The spectrum shows a very broad absorption around 3000 cm⁻¹. Broad peaks in that region usually indicate O-H stretches, like those from alcohols or maybe carboxylic acids. But wait, if it's a very broad peak, maybe it's an alcohol since carboxylic acids have a broader and sometimes more around 2500-3300. Alternatively, maybe it's an -OH in an ether? No, ethers don't usually have strong O-H stretches. Hmm, but wait—another possibility is that the broad peak is due to N-H stretching, but the options don't have nitrogen, so probably not. So I'll tentatively think that the compound has an -OH group, like an alcohol or maybe a ketone with some other functional group.

The FTIR also shows strong absorption peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. Let me think about what those could be. 1700 is a strong peak, which commonly corresponds to a carbonyl group (C=O). So maybe a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe a conjugated carbonyl like in a conjugated enone. The peak at 1650 is a bit lower, maybe a conjugated carbonyl or perhaps an aromatic ring with conjugation, like an aromatic ketone or maybe an ester with conjugation, or possibly an amide? But since the options don't have nitrogen, probably not amide.

So, putting that together, the compound likely has a carbonyl group. The 1700 could be a ketone or ester, and the 1650 might be something else. Wait, 1650 is also around the region for C=C (alkene) stretching. But wait, the NMR shows peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens, which are the hydrogens attached to a double bond. So the compound has an alkene as well. So maybe the 1650 is the C=C stretch, which is lower than a regular alkene (which is usually around 1640-1600). But conjugation can lower the wavenumber. So perhaps the compound has both a carbonyl and a double bond. That makes me think of something like a ketone with an adjacent double bond, like a cyclohexenone structure, or maybe an ester with an alkene nearby.

Looking at the 1H NMR data: there are peaks for vinyl hydrogens. So definitely an alkene is present. Additionally, the number of peaks suggests perhaps some splitting, but without more details, it's hard to say. But the presence of vinyl hydrogens tells me that the molecule has at least one double bond. 

Now, the mass spectrum shows a fragment peak at m/z =45. Hmm, m/z 45 is a common fragment. Let me think about what fragments could give that. 45 could be a (CH3)2O group, but that's 45 (15 for O and 30 for two CH3). Alternatively, it could be C3H7O+ or something else. Wait, 45 is a common mass for (CH3)2CHO+, but wait, (CH3)2CHO+ would be (3*2 + 1 + 16) = 12 + 4 + 16 = 32? No, wait, (CH3)2CHO is actually (2*(CH3) = 2*(15) ) + CHO (29?) Wait, maybe I should think differently. Let me calculate: 

m/z 45 could correspond to (CH3)2O (which is 15*2 +16= 46, no), wait, 45 is actually (CH2)2O? No, (CH2)2O would be 2*(14) +16= 44. Hmm. Or maybe it's a fragment with a carbonyl group. Wait, another possibility is (CH3)CO+, which would be (12+1*3) for CH3 (15) + CO (28) → 15+28=43. No, that's 43. Alternatively, maybe a CH2CHO+ fragment? CH2CHO is 60? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a ketone fragment. Wait, 45 is also the mass for C3H7O. Let me think about the possible groups. Alternatively, perhaps it's a CH2CH2O group, but that would be 44. Hmm, maybe it's a CH2CH(OH)+ or something. Alternatively, maybe the fragment is from an ester. Wait, another approach: 45 is also the molecular ion of pentanal (C5H10O), but no, that's molecular weight 82. Wait, perhaps it's a substituted or cleaved part. 

Wait, maybe the 45 is from a fragment like (CH2)2CO, but that would be 43. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's the tropylium ion, which is C7H7+, but that's 91. No, that's not it. Maybe the fragment is from an ester group. Let me think: 

Another approach, perhaps the molecular formula can help. The options are C6H12O, C6H10O, C6H10O2, and C6H12O2. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation for each.

Degree of unsaturation (DoU) is calculated as DoU = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming X and N are 0.

For C6H12O:
DoU = (2*6 +2 -12 -0 +0)/2 = (14-12)/2= 1. So one ring or double bond.

C6H10O:
DoU= (14-10)/2=2. So either two rings, a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds.

C6H10O2:
DoU= (14-10 - 0 +0)/2 = (14-10)/2=2. So two DoU.

C6H12O2:
DoU= (14-12)/2=1. So one DoU but with two oxygen atoms.

Wait, but wait, the IR shows a carbonyl (C=O), which is one DoU. The NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, which implies a double bond (another DoU). So total DoU from structure is at least two. So looking at the options:

Option A: C6H12O2. DoU is 1. But that would imply only one DoU (could be a ring or a double bond). But our compound has both a C=O and a C=C, which is two DoU. So that would require DoU=2, so which options fit?

Option C is C6H10O2, which gives DoU=2. So fits.

Option B is C6H10O, which also gives DoU=2.

Option D: C6H12O. DoU=1. So only one DoU. But our compound has two DoU (C=O and C=C), so it can't be D or A.

So options are B and C.

Now, back to the IR: two carbonyl peaks. One at 1700 and 1650. So perhaps two carbonyl groups or one and another group.

Wait, another possibility: The 1700 could be an ester or ketone, and the 1650 could be an aromatic ring (C=C). But the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, so the double bond is not an aromatic ring but a non-conjugated or conjugated one. So maybe it's a conjugated diene? Or perhaps the 1650 cm⁻¹ is a carbonyl with conjugation, like in an alpha, beta-unsaturated ketone or ester.

So perhaps the structure has a conjugated system, like a ketone next to a double bond. So for instance, cyclohexenone would have a conjugated C=O and C=C. That would explain the 1700 and 1650 peaks. So that would require the presence of both a carbonyl group and a double bond, contributing to the two DoU.

So in the options, only B and C have DoU=2. Now, looking at the mass spectrum. The fragment at m/z=45. Let's think about possible structures that would give that. 

If the molecule is an ester with a conjugated double bond, like methyl cyclohexene carboxylate? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a cyclic ester, but that's less likely.

Wait, 45 is a mass that could correspond to a (CH2)2O group. Wait, (CH2)2O is 44, because (12*2)+(1*4)+16=24+4+16=44. So that's not 45. Hmm. 

Wait, 45 could be (CH3)2O, which is 46, so no. What about a CH3CO group? CH3CO would be 43 (12+16 +12 +1=43). Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is from a ketone. For example, a (CH2)2CO+ would be 43. Hmm. Or perhaps it's a different arrangement.

Wait, another approach: for each possible formula, let's think about possible structures and see if they fit the data.

Option B: C6H10O. DoU=2. So that could be a cyclohexene with an alcohol group. But wait, the FTIR shows a broad peak at 3000, which might be an -OH. So maybe it's a cyclohexenol. Alternatively, a diol? But the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, so perhaps a cyclohexene with an OH group. But wait, when you have a cyclohexene and an OH group, the FTIR would show the broad O-H, the C=O? No, but wait, in option B, the formula is C6H10O, which implies only one oxygen. So the oxygen is either an alcohol or an ether. But for the IR to show a strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹, which is C=O, that would require an oxygen in a carbonyl group. So if the formula is C6H10O, but the IR shows a C=O, that would imply that the oxygen is in a carbonyl group. But C6H10O would have a carbonyl group as one DoU, and a double bond as the other. So for example, a cyclic ketone with a double bond? Like a cyclopentenone? Wait, but cyclopentenone is C5H6O. So perhaps a larger ring? Or maybe a substituted cyclohexenone.

Wait, but the options have six carbons. So perhaps something like cyclohexenone, which is C6H10O. DoU for cyclohexenone would be one ring (so one DoU) and one double bond (another DoU) plus the ketone (another, but wait, no—wait, ketone is a carbonyl, which is a double bond, so that's the third DoU? No, wait, that can't be. Let me recalculate.

Wait, cyclohexenone structure: a six-membered ring with one double bond (C=C) and one ketone (C=O). The ring is a cyclohexene, so one double bond. The ketone is another double bond (C=O). So DoU would be three: one from the ring (if it's a cyclohexene, which is a ring with one double bond, so that's one DoU), plus the ketone (another DoU). So total DoU=2? Wait, no: the ring is a cyclohexene, which has one double bond (so DoU +1), and the ketone is another DoU (+1). So cyclohexenone has two DoU. So formula would be C6H10O. So that's option B.

But does cyclohexenone fit the data?

FTIR: Broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹—does cyclohexenone have an -OH group? No, it's a ketone. So the broad peak would not be from an -OH. Hmm, that's a problem. So if the IR shows a broad peak, which suggests an -OH, but option B is a ketone without an OH, that's a conflict. 

Wait, maybe I made a mistake. The FTIR has a broad absorption, which could be from an -OH group. But in option B, C6H10O, if the oxygen is in a ketone, then the IR would show a strong C=O peak, but where's the broad peak? Oh, perhaps another functional group. Wait, but the formula is C6H10O, so only one oxygen. So if it's a ketone, then the O is in the carbonyl. So where is the broad peak coming from? Maybe it's not an -OH. Wait, another possibility: maybe the broad peak is from an alcohol, but that would require another oxygen. Wait, no, because the formula only has one O.

So perhaps that broad peak is not from an -OH. Alternative, maybe it's an N-H, but the options don't have N. Or perhaps it's an O-H from a different functional group. Wait, but with only one O, and a ketone, maybe the broad peak is not from an -OH. So maybe I'm thinking about this incorrectly.

Wait, another possibility: the broad peak could be from an ether's O-H. No, ethers don't have O-H. Alternatively, maybe it's an aldehyde's O-H, but aldehydes don't have O-H. Wait, maybe it's a conjugated system, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the broad peak is from an amide, but the options don't have N. Hmm, this is confusing. 

Let me think about the other options. Option C is C6H10O2. So DoU is 2. With two oxygen atoms, possible functional groups could be a ketone and an ester, or a carboxylic acid and something else. Wait, but let's think about the possible structures.

If the compound is an ester, which has O-C-O group, that would account for two oxygen atoms. For example, methyl cyclohexene carboxylate. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, a cyclic ester would have one oxygen, but that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe it's a diester. Hmm. 

Wait, another thought: the IR shows a broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹, which could also be from an -OH group, perhaps in a carboxylic acid. But then, a carboxylic acid would have a very broad O-H peak, often around 2500-3300, which fits. The FTIR also shows a strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹, which could be the C=O of a carboxylic acid, but usually, carboxylic acids show a peak around 1700 cm⁻¹. However, the 1650 could be from an adjacent double bond (conjugation). So maybe the compound is a substituted carboxylic acid with a double bond, like acrylic acid. But wait, acrylic acid is CH2=CHCOOH. The formula would be C3H4O2. But our options are all C6, so perhaps a substituted version.

Alternatively, maybe the compound is a cyclic ester, like a lactone. But then the formula would have two oxygen atoms, which fits option C (C6H10O2). So a lactone would have a ring structure with an ester linkage, which would give a carbonyl peak around 1700, and the ring might have a double bond, giving the 1650 peak. The broad peak at 3000 could be from an -OH if it's a cyclic hemiacetal or something, but lactones don't have -OH groups. Hmm, but then the broad peak wouldn't fit. So perhaps another possibility.

Alternatively, maybe the compound is a ketone ester, but that would have two carbonyl groups. Wait, but in that case, the IR might show two peaks. The 1700 could be the ester C=O, and the 1650 could be another carbonyl, but that would require another O, which would make it O2. Alternatively, maybe the 1650 is a conjugated double bond.

Let me think about the mass spectrum again. The fragment at m/z=45. Let's think about possible structures in option C that would have a fragment of 45.

Option C: C6H10O2. So the molecular formula is C6H10O2. Possible structures include esters, ketones with another oxygen (like a diol?), but more likely an ester.

If the molecule is an ester, perhaps a methyl ester or ethyl ester. Let's say it's an ester with a cyclohexene ring. For example, something like methyl cyclohex-2-ene-1-carboxylate. The structure would be O=C-OCH3 attached to a cyclohexene ring. So the molecular formula would be C7H10O2, but wait, our option is C6. So perhaps a substituent on the ring. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a methyl ester of a substituted cyclopentene. But again, the formula is C6. 

Wait, another approach: the molecular formula is C6H10O2. The molecular weight would be (6*12)+(10*1)+(2*16)=72+10+32=114 g/mol. 

If the mass spectrum has a peak at m/z=45, perhaps that's a fragment. Let me think of possible fragments. For example, if the molecule is a di-substituted ester, maybe losing a part of it would leave a fragment of 45.

Wait, 45 is (CH3)2CHO, which is 45? No, (CH3)2CHO is (15*2) + 16 + 12 = 15*2=30, 16 (O) +12 (C of CHO) =28. 30+28=58? No, that's not right. Alternatively, maybe the fragment is a (CH2)2CO group. Wait, (CH2)2CO is 44 (12*3 +1*4 +16=36+4+16=56? No, wait, (CH2)2CO would be (2 CH2 groups) which is 2*(12+2) = 28, plus CO (28?), wait, maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is from an acetylation. For example, if the molecule has a CH2CH2CO group, like ethyl acetate, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the fragment could be from a benzene ring, but the options don't have aromatic structures.

Wait, another thought: C-O cleavage in mass spec often leads to fragments. So if the ester group breaks, perhaps the fragment would be the carbonyl part. For example, in an ester, the O-CO-O group could break, giving a fragment with the COO group and the rest. Alternatively, maybe the ester group breaks, and the fragment is the R-O- part. 

Wait, but let's think about a specific example. Suppose the compound is methyl something ester. Then, during fragmentation, one possible cleavage is between the carbonyl and the oxygen. So, the ester group could split into a carbonyl fragment and an alcohol. For example, the fragment could be the R-O- group. 

Wait, methyl group would be 15 (CH3). So if the fragment is OCH2CH2... but not sure. Alternatively, maybe the fragment is from the carbonyl part. For example, if the ester is, say, methyl cyclohexene carboxylate. The COOCH3 would have a molecular ion of (COOCH3) which is 60 (12+16*2 +15= 12+32+15=59. Close to 60). But the fragment at 45 is lower than that. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is a methyl group attached to something else. Wait, 45 is 60 minus 15, so maybe losing a methyl group. Not sure.

Wait, another angle. Let me think about the molecular formula for option C, C6H10O2. The molecular weight is 114. The fragment at 45 is about 40% of the molecular weight. That suggests it's a significant fragment, perhaps a McLafferty rearrangement or an alpha cleavage. Alternatively, it's a stable fragment, like a tertiary carbocation.

Wait, maybe the fragment is from an allylic position. So, if the compound has a conjugated double bond adjacent to an ester, the fragment could break there. For example, if the ester is at one end of a conjugated diene, fragmenting could lose the ester group. Alternatively, the fragment could be a small group like a CH2CH2CO.

Wait, perhaps it's a pentyl group. No, 45 isn't that. Alternatively, perhaps it's a propyl group. Hmm, I'm not getting it.

Wait, another approach: the molecular formula is C6H10O2. Let's say it's an ester with the formula R-O-CO-R'. The ester group would have the carbonyl. Suppose R is a methyl group (O-CO-OCH3?), but wait, that's not how esters are structured. Esters are R-O-CO-R', so for example, methyl propanoate is CH3O-CO-CH2CH2CH3.

Wait, in that case, the ester would have a molecular formula that's R-O-CO-R', which would have (n + m + 2) O's, but in any case, for our problem, the formula is C6H10O2.

Wait, another thought: maybe the compound is a cyclic ester, like a lactone. For example, a six-membered ring with an ester linkage. Then the formula would be C6H10O2. The FTIR would show a strong C=O peak (the ester), and the broad peak around 3000 could be from an -OH if it's a hemiacetal or something, but lactones don't have -OH. Hmm, so that might not fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a diester, but that would require more oxygen atoms.

Wait, maybe it's a ketone and an ester group in the same molecule? No, that would require more oxygen. Let me think again.

Let me try to think about the possible structures for each option.

Option B: C6H10O. Possible structures: a cyclohexene with a ketone group (cyclohexenone), which has a carbonyl and a double bond. The FTIR would have a strong C=O peak at 1700 and a C=C at 1650. The broad peak at 3000 would need to be explained. But cyclohexenone doesn't have an -OH group, so that peak must be from something else. Maybe it's an aldehyde? No, because the formula is C6H10O, which is more like a ketone. Wait, maybe the broad peak is from an alpha proton to the carbonyl. No, those are usually sharp. Alternatively, perhaps the broad peak is from an -OH stretch, but then the formula would have two oxygen atoms. That's conflicting. So maybe option B isn't correct.

Option C: C6H10O2. So, two oxygen atoms. Let's say it's an ester. The ester would have a carbonyl (so 1700 cm⁻¹) and an O-H? No, ester don't have O-H. Wait, but the FTIR shows a broad absorption at 3000, which suggests an O-H. So maybe the compound is a carboxylic acid. But then the IR would show a very broad peak, but the formula would have two oxygen atoms. Wait, the formula for a carboxylic acid is RCOOH, which has two oxygen atoms in the functional group. So, for example, a substituted acrylic acid (CH2=CHCOOH) but with more carbons.

But our compound is C6H10O2. So, perhaps it's a cyclohexene carboxylic acid. Structure like cyclohex-1-ene-1-carboxylic acid. The formula would be C7H10O2. Hmm, but our option is C6. So perhaps a substituent is lost. Or maybe it's a substituted version with a double bond elsewhere.

Wait, another angle: The NMR shows vinyl hydrogens. So the double bond is present, and the IR shows a carbonyl. So the structure could be a conjugated system: a carboxylic acid with a conjugated double bond, or an ester with a conjugated double bond.

Alternatively, it's a ketone with an ester group, but that would require more oxygen.

Wait, but wait, the FTIR shows a broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹, which we were thinking might be an -OH. So if the compound is a carboxylic acid, that explains the broad peak. The 1700 would be the C=O stretch, and the 1650 could be the C=C stretch from the conjugated double bond. The NMR would show vinyl hydrogens because of the double bond. 

So, for a carboxylic acid, the formula would be RCOOH. Let's see: if it's a cyclohexene carboxylic acid, the formula would be C7H10O2. But our options are C6. So perhaps the substituent is smaller. Alternatively, perhaps it's an acrylic acid derivative, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the structure could be a substituted acrylic acid. For example, CH2=CHCOOH has the formula C3H4O2. To get C6H10O2, perhaps it's a di-substituted version, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a ketone with an adjacent double bond and an -OH group. But that would require three oxygen atoms, which is not in any of the options. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: if the compound is a cyclic hemiacetal, but that's getting too complicated. Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclic ether with a ketone, but that would require more oxygen.

Let me think about the mass spectrum again. The fragment at 45. If the molecular formula is C6H10O2 (Option C), and the mass is 114, the fragment could be a part of the molecule. For example, if the ester group is split off, leaving a fragment. The ester group is O-CO-O-R. Losing the R group would leave the oxygen and carbonyl. Hmm.

Wait, another approach. Let's calculate the possible fragments. For option C, C6H10O2, the molecular weight is 114. If the fragment is at 45, it's almost exactly 40% of the molecular weight. So it's possible that a large portion of the molecule is lost, but that doesn't immediately help.

Wait, another angle: the molecular formula C6H10O2 could be a diethyl maleate or something similar. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a substituted cyclopentanone with an ester group, but again, not sure.

Wait, perhaps the structure is methyl vinyl ketone, but that has the formula C4H6O. Not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a diester. For example, diethyl succinate is a diester, but the formula would be larger.

Wait, another thought: the broad peak at 3000 cm-1 could be from an -OH group in an ester, but esters don't have -OH groups. Alternatively, maybe it's a hydroxyl group somewhere else. Wait, maybe the compound is a beta-keto ester, which has a structure like RCOCOR'. But that would have two carbonyl groups, so the IR would have two strong peaks. Let me see: 1700 and 1650. So perhaps the 1700 is the ester carbonyl, and 1650 is the ketone carbonyl. So that would make sense. So the structure would have both a ketone and an ester group. But the formula needs to be C6H10O2.

So, for example, ethyl acetoacetate is a beta-keto ester with the formula C5H8O2. To get to C6H10O2, perhaps it's a substituted version, like adding a methyl group or something.

But I'm not making much progress. Let me think about the options again.

So, the options:

A) C6H12O2: DoU=1. Only one DoU, which wouldn't account for both C=O and C=C. So unlikely.

B) C6H10O: DoU=2. Could have a ketone and a double bond. But the FTIR broad peak is an issue.

C) C6H10O2: DoU=2. Could have an ester and a double bond, or a ketone and a double bond plus an -OH (but that would require three oxygen atoms, which we don't have).

Wait, but the FTIR has a very broad peak at 3000, which suggests an -OH. So, for option C, which has two oxygen atoms, could it have an -OH and a carbonyl group? Let's see: for example, a compound with both an -OH and a C=O group, like a phenol with a carbonyl, but that would require aromatic rings which the NMR doesn't suggest (since it's vinyl hydrogens, not aromatic).

Wait, the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, not aromatic. So the double bond is not in an aromatic ring. So, perhaps the structure has a hydroxyl group, a carbonyl group, and a double bond.

Wait, but with two oxygen atoms, the structure could be a diol with a carbonyl? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclic hemiacetal with a double bond, but that's getting too speculative.

Wait, another idea: the compound could be a diester with a conjugated double bond. For example, a structure like CH2=CHCO-O-R, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a cyclic ester with a double bond nearby. Hmm.

Wait, let me think about the mass again. 45 could be a fragment from a ketone. For example, (CH3)2CO is 58? No. Alternatively, CH3CO would be 43. But 45 is 2 more than that. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: 45 could be the m/z of a CH2CH2O group, but that's 44. Alternatively, maybe a CH2CH2O+ which is 44, but the data says 45.

Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclopentyl group. The molecular weight of cyclopentyl is (5 carbons) 5*12=60 plus 10 H (10*1=10) but that's 70, which is higher than 45. Not helpful.

Let me think about the possible structures again. If the compound is an ester, then the IR would show the ester carbonyl (about 1700 cm⁻¹), and the 1650 could be a conjugated double bond. The NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, so the double bond is present. The broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ is puzzling. Unless the ester also has an -OH group, but that's not possible unless it's a different functional group.

Wait, another thought: the broad peak at 3000 could be from an aliphatic -OH, such as in a secondary or tertiary alcohol. So, the compound could have both a carbonyl group (like an ester) and an -OH group. But that would require three oxygen atoms, which isn't the case here because the formula is C6H10O2. So two oxygen atoms, but how?

Ah! Wait, maybe the compound is a cyclic hemiacetal ester. No, that's complicated. Or perhaps it's a lactone with a hydroxyl group, but I don’t think lactones have hydroxyls.

Wait, another possibility: the compound is a β-keto alcohol. So, it has both a ketone and an alcohol group. But the formula would be C6H10O2. So, for example, cyclohexenone with an adjacent hydroxyl group. So structure like cyclohexenol with a ketone. But wait, cyclohexenol would have a double bond and an -OH, but adding a ketone would require another oxygen. Hmm, getting a bit stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is an α,β-unsaturated ester. For example, methyl acrylate is CH2=CHCOOCH3. Its formula is C4H6O2. But our option is C6H10O2, so perhaps a longer chain. For example, something like CH2=CHCH2COOCH2CH3. But the formula would need to be C6H10O2. Let me count: 

CH2=CHCH2COOCH2CH3 → that's 6 carbons (CH2-CH-CH2-COO-CH2-CH3). Wait, no, wait: CH2=CHCH2COOCH2CH3 is 6 carbons in the ester part: CH2=CHCH2- is 3, COO is 2, and CH2CH3 is 2. So that's 3+2+2=7? No, perhaps I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps it's CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3. Let's count: CH2=CHCOO- is 3 carbons (the ester part is O-CO-O), so the acid part is CH2=CHCOO- (3 carbons) and the alcohol is CH2CH2CH3 (3 carbons), so total 6 carbons. So molecular formula is C6H10O2. Yes, that fits option C.

So, the structure would be an ester: CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3. But wait, that's CH2=CHCOO(CH2)2CH3, which is pentyl acrylate. The formula would be C6H10O2. 

In this case, the FTIR would show a strong carbonyl peak around 1700 (ester C=O), and the double bond would have a peak around 1650 (conjugated with the carbonyl). The NMR would show vinyl hydrogens as the CH2=CH group. 

But wait, what about the broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ in the FTIR? Ester don't have O-H groups. Unless there's another -OH group somewhere. But the formula only has two oxygen atoms. So either the structure has an -OH, which would require another O, which it doesn't have, or the broad peak is from something else. 

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the FTIR wrong. The very broad peak at 3000 could be from an sp² C-H stretch. Vinyl hydrogens have such stretches in the 3000-3100 cm⁻¹ region, but they're usually less broad. Alternatively, the broad peak could be from an -OH group in a different environment, like a tertiary alcohol, which is less acidic and might have a broader peak. But in that case, the formula would have three oxygen atoms, which it doesn't. So this is conflicting.

Alternatively, perhaps the broad peak is from an amide's N-H, but the options don't have N. That's not helpful.

Hmm. Let me try to think of another angle. The mass spectrum shows a fragment at m/z=45. Let's imagine that the molecular ion loses a fragment of 69 (114-45=69). So, the fragment of 45 could be from the ester group. For example, in the ester R-O-CO-R', the fragment could be the R' group as a fragment. If R' is CH2CH2CH3, then its molecular weight is 45? Wait, CH2CH2CH3 is propane, which is 45 (12*3 + 1*7 = 36 +7=43? No, 43. Hmm, not 45. Alternatively, maybe it's a CH3CO group, which is 43. Hmm.

Alternatively, if the fragment is the carbonyl group with something else. For example, the ester group could lose the R group, leaving the O-CO-O. Wait, O-CO-O would have a molecular weight of 60 (16 + 12 + 16*2= 16 +12 +32=60). So that's higher than 45.

Wait, another thought: in the ester, perhaps the acyloxy group breaks off. For example, the ester group is R-O-CO-R', and the R' group could be a fragment. If R' is CH2CH2CH3, that's 43. Not matching. Alternatively, maybe the fragment is from the acid part of the ester. For example, if the acid is CH2=CHCOO-, its molecular weight is 58 (12*3 +1*5 +16*2= 36+5+32=73? No, that can't be right. Wait: CH2=CHCOOH has molecular weight 84 (12*3 +1*5 +16*2 +1= 36 +5 +32 +1=74). So that's higher than 45.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is from the alcohol part of the ester. For example, if the ester is methyl something, the fragment would be methyl (15), but that's not 45.

Wait, perhaps the fragment is the acylium ion. For example, the COO group could form a fragment. COO- has a mass of 44, but that's not matching. Alternatively, the CH2=CHCOO+ would have a mass of 73 (12*3 +1*5 +16*2= 36+5+32=73). So not matching 45.

Hmm, I'm not making progress here. Let me think again.

Option C is C6H10O2. The molecular formula suggests a structure with two oxygen-containing groups. If it's an ester, then an O in the ester linkage. Alternatively, perhaps a ketone and an alcohol, but that would require three oxygens, which is not possible.

Wait, another possibility: the compound is a cyclic ester (lactone) with a double bond. So, the structure would have a ring with an ester linkage and a double bond. For example, a six-membered ring with an ester group (O-CO-O) and a double bond. The FTIR would show the ester C=O at 1700, and the double bond C=C at 1650. The broad peak at 3000 cm-1 might be from an -OH if it's a lactone with a hydroxyl group, but lactones don't have hydroxyls. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the broad peak is from the conjugated system. But I'm not sure.

Another approach: Let me count the possible fragments for option C again. C6H10O2 has a molecular weight of 114. If a fragment is at 45, it's possible that the molecule breaks into two parts, one being 45 and the other 69. Are there functional groups that would produce a 45 fragment?

Wait, 45 could be from a CH3COO group. CH3COO is 45 (12+16*2 +1*3= 12+32+3=47? No, 12*2=24, 16*2=32, 3 H's? Wait, CH3COO is 45? Let me calculate: Carbon: 2, Hydrogen:3, Oxygen:2. So 2*12=24, 3*1=3, 2*16=32. Total is 24+3+32=59. So that's not right. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: 45 could be a methylene group from a larger structure. Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is from an isopropyl group. Isopropyl is 45? No, isopropyl is (CH(CH3)2) which is 45? 12*3 (for three carbons) + 1*6 (for 6 H) +0 (no O) =36 +6=42. No, that's 42.

Hmm. I'm getting stuck. Let me try to recap.

The key points:

1. FTIR: Broad peak ~3000 cm-¹ (likely O-H stretch), strong peaks at 1700 (C=O) and 1650 (C=C or conjugated C=O).

2. 1H NMR: peaks for vinyl H, so double bond present.

3. Mass spec: fragment at m/z=45.

4. Options: A (C6H12O2, DoU=1), B (C6H10O, DoU=2), C (C6H10O2, DoU=2), D (C6H12O, DoU=1).

From the IR data, the presence of a broad peak suggests an -OH group, but the carbonyl and double bond imply two DoU. So options B and C have two DoU. 

Option B: C6H10O. If it's a ketone with a double bond, like cyclohexenone, but then where's the -OH? Unless the broad peak isn't from -OH, but perhaps another source like an aldehyde's C-H stretch? Unlikely, as aldehydes don't have broad peaks.

Option C: C6H10O2. Can this have an -OH group? Only if it's a carboxylic acid (which would have two O's: one in the COOH group). Wait, a carboxylic acid has the formula RCOOH, which has two O's in the functional group. So, for example, cyclopentene carboxylic acid would have formula C6H10O2. 

So, structure: cyclopentene ring with a carboxylic acid group. So, 5-membered ring with a double bond and a COOH group. Let's see: the ring has five carbons, the COOH is the sixth. 

In this case, the FTIR would show a broad O-H peak from the COOH group (which is usually very broad and around 2500-3300 cm⁻¹). The C=O of the carboxylic acid would be around 1700 cm⁻¹. The conjugated C=C in the ring would have a peak around 1650 cm⁻¹. The NMR would show vinyl hydrogens from the double bond. 

The mass spectrum would have a fragment at m/z=45. Let's think: the carboxylic acid group could fragment. For example, the COOH group could lose a CO2, leaving a fragment with the rest. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, the ring could break, releasing a smaller fragment. 

If the compound is cyclopentene carboxylic acid, the molecular formula is C6H10O2. The mass is 114. The fragment at 45 could be from the ring breaking off as a cyclopentyl group (which is 66), but that's not matching. Alternatively, maybe the COOH group breaks off, leaving a cyclopentene fragment. The molecular weight of cyclopentene (C5H8) is 72, which doesn't match 45. Hmm.

Alternatively, the fragment could be from part of the molecule. For example, if the molecule breaks between the ring and the COOH group, the COOH would leave as a fragment. The molecular weight of COOH (without the R group) is 46 (12 + 16*2 +1= 12+32+1=45). Wait, yes! Because COOH has a formula of COOH (COOH is CO2H, right?) So the COOH group is COOH, which has a molecular weight of 46 (12 + 16*2 +1 = 45? Wait, 12 (C) + 16*2 (O2) +1 (H) = 12+32+1=45. So the COOH group has a mass of 45. So in the mass spectrum, the fragment at m/z=45 would correspond to the COOH group. 

But wait, in the mass spectrum, the fragment would be the COOH group losing a proton? Or maybe as a neutral fragment. Alternatively, the molecular ion could lose a part and form a fragment. 

If the compound is a carboxylic acid with a cyclopentene ring, the mass would be 114. If the fragment is the COOH group (45), the remaining part would be 114-45=69, which would correspond to the cyclopentene ring (which has a molecular weight of 66). Hmm, but 69 is 66 +3, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule loses the COOH group as a fragment. But the COOH group's mass is 45, so the remaining would be 114-45=69. But the cyclopentene part is 66, so perhaps it's a different structure.

Wait, another thought: the fragment could be the methyl group from the ester. For example, in the ester, the methyl group (15) isn't 45. Alternatively, the ethyl group is 46, close but not quite. Hmm.

Wait, but earlier I thought that the COOH group has a molecular weight of 45. So if the fragment is at 45, it's likely the COOH group. So if the compound is a carboxylic acid, like cyclopentene carboxylic acid, then the mass spectrum would show a fragment from the COOH group. But wait, in the mass spectrum, the base peak would be the molecular ion, and the fragment would be the COOH group. But that's speculative.

So, putting it all together: the IR suggests a carboxylic acid (broad peak), a carbonyl (1700), and a conjugated double bond (1650). The NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, which fits. The mass fragment at 45 would correspond to the COOH group. So the formula would be C6H10O2, which is option C.

Wait, but wait: cyclopentene carboxylic acid has the formula C6H10O2. So yes, that fits option C. 

Therefore, the correct answer is C6H10O2, which is option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To identify the unknown compound, the following data was analyzed:

### **FTIR Data**
- **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹**: Indicates the presence of an -OH group, likely from a carboxylic acid or alcohol.
- **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹**: Suggests a carbonyl group (C=O), likely from a carboxylic acid or ester.
- **Strong absorption at 1650 cm⁻¹**: Indicates a conjugated double bond (C=C) or a carbonyl group with conjugation.

### **¹H NMR Data**
- Peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens confirm the presence of a double bond.

### **Mass Spectrometry Data**
- A fragment peak at **m/z = 45** suggests a fragment with a molecular weight of 45. This could correspond to the COOH group (carboxylic acid), which has a molecular weight of 45.

### **Analysis of Options**
1. **Option A: C₆H₁₂O₂**  
   - Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) = 1.  
   - This implies only one double bond or ring, which is inconsistent with the presence of both a carbonyl group and a double bond (two DoU required).  
   - **Eliminated.**

2. **Option B: C₆H₁₀O**  
   - DoU = 2.  
   - This could accommodate both a carbonyl group and a double bond. However, the FTIR data shows a broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹, which is characteristic of an -OH group. This would require an additional oxygen atom, which is not present in this formula.  
   - **Eliminated.**

3. **Option C: C₆H₁₀O₂**  
   - DoU = 2.  
   - This formula can accommodate both a carbonyl group and a double bond.  
   - The FTIR data fits a carboxylic acid with a conjugated double bond. The broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹ corresponds to the -OH group of the carboxylic acid, the strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹ corresponds to the C=O bond, and the absorption at 1650 cm⁻¹ corresponds to the conjugated double bond.  
   - The mass fragment at m/z = 45 corresponds to the COOH group.  
   - The ¹H NMR data aligns with the presence of vinyl hydrogens from the double bond.  
   - **Fits all data.**

4. **Option D: C₆H₁₂O**  
   - DoU = 1.  
   - Similar to Option A, this implies only one double bond or ring, which is inconsistent with the presence of both a carbonyl group and a double bond.  
   - **Eliminated.**

### **Conclusion**
The compound is identified as **C₆H₁₀O₂**, which corresponds to a carboxylic acid with a conjugated double bond. The FTIR, ¹H NMR, and mass spectrometry data all support this structure.

**Answer: C**
