Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity and differential geometry, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, the metric given is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). I remember that metrics describe the geometry of spacetime, and in this case, it looks like a two-dimensional space since there are only dx and dy terms. Wait, or is it a higher dimension? No, the line element is in terms of dx and dy, so maybe it's a two-dimensional surface embedded in some higher-dimensional space?

Wait, the question is about a pseudosphere of radius r=2. Oh, right, a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature, kind of like a hyperbolic space. The metric resembles something like the Poincaré disk model, which I think is a way to represent hyperbolic geometry in the plane.

The Poincaré disk model has a metric of the form (ds)^2 = (4/(1 - x² - y²)^2) (dx² + dy²), if I remember correctly. Wait, but in our case, the denominator is 4 - x² - y². Let me see: 4 is 2 squared, so maybe it's scaled. Let's compare.

In the standard Poincaré disk, the metric is (ds)^2 = (4/(1 - r²)^2) (dr² + r² dθ²), where r is the radial coordinate (r < 1). Alternatively, in terms of x and y, it would be (4/(1 - x² - y²)^2) (dx² + dy²). Our given metric is (32/(4 - x² - y²)) (dx² + dy²). Hmm, that doesn't look the same as the standard Poincaré metric. Wait, maybe it's a different model or scaled somehow.

Wait, perhaps the metric is conformally flat, meaning it's like a flat metric scaled by some factor. The standard Euclidean metric is dx² + dy², and here it's multiplied by 32/(4 - x² - y²). So the conformal factor is 32/(4 - r²), where r² = x² + y².

So the area in such a metric would be an integral over the surface. For a two-dimensional surface, the area element is sqrt(g) dx dy, where g is the determinant of the metric tensor. But wait, the metric here is diagonal, so g would be the product of the coefficients. Let me think: the metric tensor components are [32/(4 - r²)] for dx² and the same for dy². So g = (32/(4 - r²)) * (32/(4 - r²)) ) = (32)^2/(4 - r²)^2. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the metric is ds² = A dx² + A dy², where A = 32/(4 - x² - y²). So the determinant would be (A)(A) - 0 = A². So the square root of the determinant is A. So the area element is A dx dy = [32/(4 - r²)] dx dy.

Wait, but to compute the area, I need to integrate this over the region where the metric is defined. So the area would be the double integral over x and y of [32/(4 - (x² + y²))] dx dy, within the domain where 4 - x² - y² > 0, which is the disk of radius 2 (since x² + y² <4). So the domain is r from 0 to 2, and θ from 0 to 2π.

It's easier to switch to polar coordinates. So x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ, dx dy = r dr dθ.

So the area becomes the integral from r=0 to 2, and θ=0 to 2π of [32/(4 - r²)] * r dr dθ.

We can separate the integrals. The integral over θ is from 0 to 2π, which is 2π. The integral over r is ∫ (32 r)/(4 - r²) dr from 0 to 2.

Let me compute the radial integral first: ∫ [32 r/(4 - r²)] dr.

Let me do substitution: Let u = 4 - r². Then du/dr = -2r → -du/2 = r dr.

So the integral becomes ∫ [32 r / u ] dr = 32 ∫ [r dr / u ] = 32 ∫ [ (-du/2 ) / u ] = (-32/2) ∫ du/u = -16 ∫ du/u.

The limits: when r=0, u=4; when r=2, u=0. So the integral becomes -16 ∫ from u=4 to u=0 of (1/u) du.

Which is -16 [ ln(u) ] evaluated from 4 to 0. Wait, but ln(0) is negative infinity. Hmm, that's concerning. Let me compute it.

Wait, when substituting, the limits go from u=4 (lower limit r=0) to u=0 (upper limit r=2). So:

Integral from r=0 to 2 is same as ∫ u=4 to u=0 of [ ... ].

So our substitution gives:

-16 ∫ from u=4 to u=0 (1/u) du = -16 [ ln(u) ] from 4 to 0 = -16 [ ln(0) - ln(4) ]

But ln(0) is negative infinity, so ln(0) is -infty. So [ ln(0) - ln(4) ] is (-infty) - something, which is -infty. So the integral becomes -16 * (-infty) = positive infinity.

Wait, but wait, the original integral was ∫ (32 r)/(4 - r²) dr from 0 to 2. Let me compute that more carefully.

The integral ∫ [32 r/(4 - r²)] dr from 0 to 2.

Let me make the substitution u=4 - r². So, du = -2r dr → r dr = -du/2.

So the integral becomes ∫ [32 r/(u)] dr = 32 ∫ [r dr / u ] = 32 ∫ [ (-du/2) / u ] = (-16) ∫ (1/u) du.

But the limits when r=0, u=4; r=2, u=0.

So the integral becomes (-16) [ ∫ from u=4 to u=0 (1/u) du ] which is (-16) [ ln(u) evaluated from 4 to 0 ].

= (-16) [ ln(0) - ln(4) ] = (-16) [ (-infty) - ln(4) ) ] = (-16) [ -infty - ln4 ].

Which is (-16) * (-infty) = positive infinity. Because ln4 is finite, so the dominant term is infty.

Wait, but wait, when we integrate from u=4 to u=0, the integral is ∫ (1/u) du from 4 to 0, which is the same as -∫ from 0 to 4 of (1/u) du. Since the integral of 1/u is ln u, so ∫ from 4 to 0 is ln(0) - ln(4) → which is (-infty) - ln4.

So the integral becomes (-16) * ( ln(0) - ln(4) ) = (-16) * ( -infty - ln4 ) → which is (-16) * (-infty) → positive infinity.

Wait, but that can't be right because 32 r/(4 - r²) as r approaches 2 from below, the denominator approaches zero, so the integrand becomes very large. So the integral would diverge, meaning the area is infinite.

But wait, that's in the case of the Poincaré disk model. The area of the hyperbolic plane is infinite, right? Because it's a negatively curved space and has more area than the Euclidean plane. So perhaps this metric represents a hyperbolic plane, and the area is infinite, which would match option D, which says +infty.

But wait, the question is about the area of a pseudosphere of radius r=2. Wait, pseudosphere is a specific surface, not the entire hyperbolic plane. Or maybe it's a surface with finite area.

Wait, a pseudosphere (trumpet) has finite area, but I thought it had infinite surface area. Or maybe I'm confusing it with something else. Let me think. A pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature, kind of like a horn. I seem to recall that its surface area is finite, but its volume is infinite. Or wait, maybe the other way around. Alternatively, perhaps the area here is infinite because the model we're considering is the entire hyperbolic plane, not a pseudosphere.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused here. The question says, "What is the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2?"

Wait, what's the radius of a pseudosphere? I'm not exactly certain, but perhaps it refers to the curvature radius. In hyperbolic geometry, the radius of curvature is related to the Gaussian curvature. For a pseudosphere with Gaussian curvature K = -1/R², where R is the radius of curvature. Wait, or is it K = -1/(R^2), so R would be the radius. But in the Poincaré disk model, the curvature is K = -1, which corresponds to R=1. But in our metric, the denominator is 4−x²−y², which suggests that the radius is 2. So maybe the curvature here is K=−1/(2)^2=−1/4.

Alternatively, maybe the metric represents a hyperbolic plane with curvature K=−1/(radius)^2. So in our case, the radius is 2, so K=−1/4.

But regardless, the metric is defined for x² + y² <4, which is a disk of radius 2. So the area would be the integral of the area element over this disk.

Wait, earlier when I computed the integral, I found that the area is infinite. But that can't be right for a pseudosphere, which I thought has finite area. Or does it?

Wait, no. Let me think again. The standard pseudosphere (like the tractricoid) has finite area. The surface area of a pseudosphere is finite, but the metric here might be representing a different model.

Wait, perhaps this is the metric of a hyperbolic plane, which has infinite area. The question says, "the pseudosphere of radius r=2," but I'm not sure if that refers to the pseudosphere (tractricoid) or the hyperbolic plane. Hmm.

Wait, the given metric is similar to the Poincaré disk model, but scaled. The Poincaré disk has metric (4/(1 - r²)^2) (dr² + r² dθ²), but our metric is (32/(4 - r²)) (dr² + r² dθ²). Let me compute the square of the area element. Wait, no, the area element is the sqrt of the determinant of the metric tensor. The metric tensor in polar coordinates would be diagonal with components g_rr =32/(4-r²) and g_θθ= (32 r²)/(4 - r²). So the determinant is g_rr * g_θθ = (32/(4 - r²)) * (32 r²/(4 - r²)) ) = (32^2 r²) / (4 - r²)^2.

Wait, wait, no. Let's write the metric in polar coordinates. Let me see, the original metric is in 2D (dx, dy), so in polar coordinates, dx = dr cosθ - r sinθ dθ, dy = dr sinθ + r cosθ dθ. But that might complicate things. Alternatively, since the metric is conformally flat, the area element is A(r) * r dr dθ, where A(r) is the conformal factor.

Wait, the area element in polar coordinates for a conformally flat metric would be sqrt(g) dr dθ, where g is the determinant. Since the metric is ds² = (32/(4 - r²)) (dr² + r² dθ²). So the determinant g = (32/(4 - r²)) * (32 r²/(4 - r²)) )= [32^2 r²]/(4 - r²)^2.

So sqrt(g) = [32 r ]/(4 - r²). So the area element is [32 r/(4 - r²)] dr dθ.

So the area would be the integral over r from 0 to 2 (since 4 - r² must be positive) and θ from 0 to 2π.

So the area A = ∫ (θ from 0 to 2π) ∫ (r=0 to 2) [32 r/(4 - r²)] dr dθ.

We can factor out the 32, and the θ integral is 2π. So A = 32 * 2π * ∫ (r=0 to 2) [ r/(4 - r²) ] dr.

So the integral I = ∫ [ r/(4 - r²) ] dr from 0 to 2.

Let me compute I. Let u = 4 - r² → du = -2r dr → r dr = -du/2.

So I = ∫ [ r dr/(4 - r²) ] = ∫ [ (-du/2) / u ] = (-1/2) ∫ (1/u) du.

The limits: when r=0 → u=4; when r=2 → u=0.

So I = (-1/2) [ ln(u) ] from 4 to 0 = (-1/2) [ ln(0) - ln(4) ].

ln(0) is -infty, so I = (-1/2) [ (-infty) - ln4 ] = (-1/2)(-infty) = +infty.

Wait, wait, that can't be right because the denominator approaches zero as r approaches 2, making the integrand blow up. So the integral I is divergent, meaning the area is infinite.

Wait, but the pseudosphere is supposed to have a finite area. Hmm. Maybe I've made a mistake in the setup.

Alternatively, perhaps the metric isn't representing the entire hyperbolic plane but a different surface. Or maybe the question is about a different kind of pseudosphere.

Wait, the question is about the area of a pseudosphere of radius r=2. So perhaps this is a surface embedded in 3D space, like the tractricoid, which has finite area. For example, I recall that the surface area of a pseudosphere (tractricoid) is 4π, but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, let me think about the tractricoid. The tractrix has a certain property, and the pseudosphere is its surface of revolution. The surface area of a pseudosphere can be calculated using an integral. Let me recall the formula for surface area.

The formula for the surface area of a surface of revolution is 2π times the integral of the arc length of the profile curve. For the tractrix, which is the profile curve of the pseudosphere.

The tractrix has the property that the distance from the tangent to the point is constant, equal to a. The surface area would then be 4π a^2, if I remember correctly. So for radius a=2, the area would be 4π*(2)^2 = 16π. But that's not one of the options. Alternatively, if the radius is considered differently.

Wait, maybe the metric given doesn't represent the entire pseudosphere but a portion of it. Alternatively, perhaps the area is infinite because the metric covers the entire hyperbolic plane, which has infinite area.

So, going back to the options:

Options are:

A) 0

B) 4π(x²+y²)

C)4π(x²−y²)

D)+infty

Wait, the area can't be dependent on x and y because the area is a global property, not a local one. So options B and C are likely incorrect because they depend on position. That leaves A (0) and D (infinite).

But in our calculation, the area integral diverges, giving an infinite area. So the answer would be D.

But wait, the pseudosphere is a finite area surface, but perhaps the given metric represents the entire hyperbolic plane, which has infinite area. So in that case, the area of the pseudosphere (as in the tractricoid) would be finite, but the question might be referring to the space described by the metric, which is hyperbolic and thus has infinite area.

So, the question is a bit ambiguous. If the metric represents a hyperbolic plane, then the area is infinite. If it's a pseudosphere (tractricoid) embedded in 3D space, then the area is finite.

But the options suggest that D is an option, and given the metric as given, the area is infinite. So the answer must be D.

The given metric is 

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left( dx^2 + dy^2 \right),
\]

which describes a two-dimensional surface embedded in a higher-dimensional space. This metric resembles the Poincaré disk model of hyperbolic geometry, where the conformal factor scales the Euclidean metric. The domain of the metric is the disk \( x^2 + y^2 < 4 \), corresponding to a radius of 2.

To compute the area, the area element for a conformally flat metric \( ds^2 = A(r)^2 (dr^2 + r^2 d\theta^2) \) is \( \sqrt{g} \, dr \, d\theta \), where \( g \) is the determinant of the metric tensor. For this metric, the determinant is \( g = A^2 \), so the area element becomes \( A(r) \, dr \, d\theta \), where \( A(r) = \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \) in polar coordinates (\( r^2 = x^2 + y^2 \)).

The area is then computed as:

\[
A = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^2 \frac{32r}{4 - r^2} \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

The angular integral \( \int_0^{2\pi} d\theta = 2\pi \) is straightforward. The radial integral \( \int_0^2 \frac{32r}{4 - r^2} \, dr \) is evaluated using the substitution \( u = 4 - r^2 \), \( du = -2r \, dr \), which transforms the integral into:

\[
\int_4^0 \frac{-32}{2u} \, du = -16 \int_4^0 \frac{1}{u} \, du = -16 \left[ \ln(u) \right]_4^0.
\]

As \( u \to 0 \), \( \ln(u) \to -\infty \), leading to a divergent integral. This indicates that the area of the surface described by the metric is infinite.

The question asks for the area of the "pseudosphere of radius \( r = 2 \)." While the tractricoid (a standard pseudosphere) has finite area, the metric provided represents the entire hyperbolic plane, which has infinite area. Therefore, the correct interpretation of the question is that the area of the surface described by the metric is infinite.

Analyzing the options:

- **A) 0**: Incorrect, as the area is not zero.
- **B) \( 4\pi(x^2 + y^2) \)**: Incorrect, as the area is a global property and does not depend on \( x \) and \( y \).
- **C) \( 4\pi(x^2 - y^2) \)**: Incorrect, for the same reason as above.
- **D) \( +\infty \)**: Correct, as the area of the surface described by the metric is infinite.

Thus, the area of the pseudosphere of radius \( r = 2 \) is infinite.
