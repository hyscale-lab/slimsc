Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

So the problem says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate. The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants for the complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. The question is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species. The options are A to D.

Wait, what's the structure here? I remember that stability constants (formation constants) tell us how stable a complex is. The higher the β, the more stable the complex. Each β corresponds to a different complex. So, Co(II) can form complexes with SCN- in varying numbers.

The complexes are probably [Co(SCN)]^n+ where n is the number of SCN- ions. So β1 is for the first complex, like CoSCN^+, β2 for the second, maybe Co(SCN)2^0, β3 for Co(SCN)3^-2, and β4 for Co(SCN)4^-3? Or wait, I'm not sure about the charges. Let me think: each SCN- is -1, so each complex would have a charge based on how many SCN are attached and the Co charge.

Wait, Co(II) is +2. So, for each SCN- (each -1), the complex charge would be:

- If 1 SCN: CoSCN^+ (2-1=+1)
- 2 SCNs: Co(SCN)2^0 (2-2=0)
- 3 SCNs: Co(SCN)3^- (2-3=-1)
- 4 SCNs: Co(SCN)4^2- (2-4= -2)

But stability constants are for the formation of the complexes. So, βn = [Co(SCN)_n]/[Co][SCN]^n.

But wait, the problem is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex. I think the blue one is probably the [Co(SCN)2]^0 complex. Because I remember that [Co(SCN)2]^0 is blue. So, the question is asking about the percentage of [Co(SCN)2]^0 in the solution.

To find the percentage of a particular species, I think I need to calculate the fraction of each possible complex and the free Co^2+ ion. Then sum all those fractions and find the percentage for the desired species.

The total concentration of all cobalt species is given as c(Co) = 1e-2 M. But wait, the solution also has SCN- at 0.1 M. So, the formation of the complexes depends on the concentrations of Co^2+ and SCN-.

Hmm, how to approach this. I think the general approach is to calculate the distribution of Co species using the stability constants (β). The idea is that each β represents the formation of a complex with n SCN- ions.

The distribution of species can be found using the formation constants and the concentrations of the metal and ligand. The fraction of each complex is determined by the product of β and the term ( [L]^n / [Co] ) for each step.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me try to recall the method. The fraction of each complex can be calculated using the formula: 

f_n = (β_n * [SCN]^n) / (1 + β1*[SCN] + β1β2*[SCN]^2 + β1β2β3*[SCN]^3 + ... up to n terms )

Wait, no, perhaps it's more accurate to model it using the cumulative formation. Let me think again.

Each complex [Co(SCN)_n] is formed in steps. The formation of the first complex is Co + SCN → CoSCN^+ with stability constant β1. The second step is CoSCN^+ + SCN → Co(SCN)2^0 with β2, and so on.

So, the total concentration of Co is the sum of all possible species: [Co^2+] + [CoSCN^+] + [Co(SCN)2^0] + [Co(SCN)3^-] + [Co(SCN)4^2-].

But the way to compute the fractions is by considering that each subsequent complex is formed by multiplying the previous β by the next step. So, the fractions are calculated based on the relative products of β and the powers of [SCN-].

Alternatively, the fraction of the n-th complex is given by:

f_n = (β_n * [SCN]^n) / (sum_{k=0 to 4} β_k * [SCN]^k )

Wait, no, wait, I think it's more about the product of the stepwise formation constants up to that point. Because each complex is built upon the previous.

Wait, another approach: The fraction of each species is given by the ratio of the product of the formation constants up to that species, times the appropriate power of [SCN], divided by the sum of all such terms for all possible species.

Let me think in terms of the stepwise formation.

The formation of the first complex is Co^2+ + SCN^- ↔ CoSCN^+, β1 = [CoSCN^+]/([Co^2+][SCN^-]) =9.

The second complex is CoSCN^+ + SCN^- ↔ Co(SCN)_2^0, β2=40. So overall, the formation from Co^2+ would be β1*β2= 9*40=360. So for [Co(SCN)_2^0], the stability from Co^2+ is β1β2.

Similarly, the third complex has β3=63, so the overall for [Co(SCN)_3^-] is β1β2β3=9*40*63= 22680.

The fourth complex has β4=16, so β1β2β3β4 = 22680 *16= 362880.

Wait, but each step actually is the stepwise formation. So, the fraction of each complex is determined by multiplying the stepwise βs up to that complex, multiplied by [SCN]^n, divided by the sum of all such terms for each possible n.

Wait, the general formula for the fraction of the n-th complex is:

f_n = (β_1 β_2 ... β_n [SCN]^n ) / (1 + β_1 [SCN] + (β_1 β_2)[SCN]^2 + (β_1 β_2 β_3)[SCN]^3 + ... )

Wait, no. Because each β represents the stepwise formation from the previous complex. So, the total formation constant for the n-th complex is the product of β1 to βn.

Wait, perhaps each complex [Co(SCN)_n] is formed from Co^2+ plus n SCN^- through a series of steps. So the overall β for the n-th complex is the product of β1 through βn.

Thus, the fraction f_n is given by:

f_n = (β1 β2 ... βn [SCN]^n) / (Σ_{k=0}^4 (β1 β2 ... βk) [SCN]^k )

But wait, when n=0, it's the free Co^2+ ion, which would have a term of 1, since the product of zero βs is 1.

Wait, but wait, let me make sure. Another approach: the fraction of each species is determined by the product of the stepwise βs and [SCN]^n, divided by the sum of all such products for n=0 to 4.

So, for each possible n (0≤n≤4), the term is (β_1 β_2 ... β_n) [SCN]^n.

But for n=0 (free Co^2+), the product is 1, and [SCN]^0=1, so the term is 1.

For n=1, it's β1 [SCN]^1 =9 * 0.1.

For n=2, it's β1 β2 [SCN]^2 =9*40*(0.1)^2.

Similarly, for n=3: β1 β2 β3 [SCN]^3 =9*40*63*(0.1)^3.

n=4: β1 β2 β3 β4 [SCN]^4=9*40*63*16*(0.1)^4.

So, first I'll compute each term:

n=0: 1 * 1 =1.

n=1: 9 *0.1 =0.9.

n=2:9*40*(0.1)^2=360 *0.01=3.6.

n=3:9*40*63*(0.1)^3= (9*40=360; 360*63=22680). 22680 * (0.001)=22.68.

n=4:9*40*63*16*(0.1)^4. Let's compute step by step: 9*40=360, 360*63=22680, 22680*16=362880. Then 362880 * (0.1)^4= 362880 * 0.0001 = 36.288.

Wait, but wait. Let me compute each:

n=0: 1.

n=1:9 *0.1 =0.9.

n=2:9 *40 =360; 360*(0.1)^2=360*0.01=3.6.

n=3:3.6 *63=226.8; * (0.1)=22.68? Wait, wait, no. Wait, for n=3, the step is [Co(SCN)_3^-], so β3 is 63. So β1 β2 β3=9*40*63=22680. Then multiplied by [SCN]^3: (0.1)^3=0.001. So 22680 *0.001=22.68.

n=4: β4=16. So β1 β2 β3 β4 =9*40*63*16. Let me compute that:

9 *40 =360.

360 *63=22680.

22680 *16=362880.

Multiply by [SCN]^4=0.1^4=0.0001.

362880 *0.0001=36.288.

So the terms are:

n=0:1

n=1:0.9

n=2:3.6

n=3:22.68

n=4:36.288

Now, sum all these terms to get the denominator, which is the sum of all possible terms.

Sum = 1 +0.9 +3.6 +22.68 +36.288.

Let me compute that:

1 +0.9=1.9

1.9+3.6=5.5

5.5 +22.68=28.18

28.18 +36.288=64.468.

So the sum is 64.468.

The fraction f_2 is the term for n=2 divided by the sum. So f_2 =3.6 /64.468.

Let me compute that.

3.6 divided by 64.468.

3.6 /64.468 ≈ 0.05557, which is approximately 5.557%.

Wait, but wait, that's not right. Because 3.6 is much smaller than other terms, especially n=3 and n=4. But wait, the question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex, which is the [Co(SCN)2]^0, which is the n=2 term. But according to this calculation, that would be about 5.55%, but the options are way higher.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the way I'm calculating the fractions.

Wait, wait, perhaps I should consider that each step is relative to the previous. Alternatively, perhaps I should model it as each species being built upon the previous.

Wait, another approach is to model the distribution using the cumulative formation constants. The fraction of each species can be calculated using the formula:

f_n = (β_1 β_2 ... β_n [L]^n ) / (1 + β_1 [L] + β_1 β_2 [L]^2 + β_1 β_2 β_3 [L]^3 + ... )

So for each n, the numerator is the product of the first n βs multiplied by [L]^n, and the denominator is the sum up to n=4.

Wait, but that's what I did earlier, but the result seems too low for option n=2.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the terms.

Wait, let me recompute each term.

n=0: 1 =1.

n=1: β1 [SCN] =9 * 0.1 = 0.9.

n=2: β1 β2 [SCN]^2 =9*40*(0.1)^2 = 360 *0.01=3.6.

n=3: β1 β2 β3 [SCN]^3=9*40*63*(0.1)^3.

Compute 9*40=360; 360 *63=22680.

(0.1)^3=0.001. So 22680 *0.001=22.68.

n=4: β1 β2 β3 β4 [SCN]^4=9*40*63*16*(0.1)^4.

Compute 9*40=360; 360*63=22680; 22680*16=362880.

(0.1)^4=0.0001 → 362880 *0.0001=36.288.

Now, sum all terms:

1 +0.9 =1.9

1.9 +3.6=5.5

5.5 +22.68=28.18

28.18 +36.288=64.468.

So the total is 64.468.

So the fraction f_2 is 3.6 /64.468 ≈0.05557.

That’s about 5.56%, but the options are much higher. So I must have made a mistake in understanding which term corresponds to which complex.

Wait, I think I might have confused the stepwise formation constants. Because each β is a stepwise constant, not the overall constant. So the overall β for the n-th complex is the product of β1 to βn.

Wait, for the first complex, [CoSCN^+], β1 is the formation constant.

For the second complex, [Co(SCN)2^0], the formation constant is β1 * β2, because it's [Co(SCN)_2]/([Co][SCN]^2) = β1 * β2.

Similarly, [Co(SCN)_3^-] has β_total=β1*β2*β3.

And [Co(SCN)_4^2-] has β_total=β1*β2*β3*β4.

So, the fractions are based on these overall βs.

But wait, another approach is that the fraction of each species depends on the product of the formation constants up to that point and the ligand concentration. So, the fraction f_n is (β_1 β_2 ... β_n [L]^n) divided by the sum of all (β_1 ... β_k [L]^k) for k=0 to 4.

So the denominator is sum_{k=0 to 4} (β_1 ... β_k [L]^k)

But for k=0, it's 1.

So the terms are:

k=0: 1.

k=1: β1 [L] =9 *0.1=0.9.

k=2: β1 β2 [L]^2=9*40*(0.1)^2=360 * 0.01=3.6.

k=3:9*40*63*(0.1)^3=22680 *0.001=22.68.

k=4:9*40*63*16*(0.1)^4=362880 *0.0001=36.288.

So sum is 1 +0.9 +3.6 +22.68 +36.288 =64.468.

So, the fraction for k=2 is 3.6 /64.468.

3.6 /64.468 ≈0.05557 → ~5.56%.

But the options are A)42.3%, B)25.6%, C)38.1%, D)16.9%. So 5.56% isn't matching any options. So, this suggests I'm making a mistake.

Wait a minute, perhaps the question is about the percentage of dithiocyanato complexes, which would be n=2 and n=4? Because di means two, but wait, dithiocyanato would imply two SCN per Co, which is n=2.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it's the 'blue dithiocyanato' complex. I think dithiocyanato is [Co(SCN)_2]^0, which is n=2.

But according to the calculation, the fraction is about 5.56%, which isn't an option. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the fact that the total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M. Because the sum of all fractions should multiply by the total concentration to get the actual concentrations.

Wait, no, the fractions are already based on relative concentrations, so the percentages should be correct.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the way I compute the fractions. Another approach is to let x be the concentration of free Co^2+, and then express all other species in terms of x.

But that might be complicated, but let's try.

Let me denote:

[Co^2+] = x.

[CoSCN^+] = β1 x [SCN^-] =9* x * 0.1 =0.9 x.

[Co(SCN)_2^0] = β1 β2 x [SCN^-]^2 =9*40 *x * (0.1)^2 =360 *x *0.01=3.6 x.

[Co(SCN)_3^-] = β1 β2 β3 x [SCN^-]^3 =9*40*63 *x * (0.1)^3 =22680 x *0.001=22.68 x.

[Co(SCN)_4^2-] = β1 β2 β3 β4 x [SCN^-]^4 =9*40*63*16 *x * (0.1)^4 =362880 x * 0.0001=36.288 x.

The total Co is x +0.9x +3.6x +22.68x +36.288x = (1 +0.9+3.6+22.68+36.288)x =64.468 x.

But the total Co is given as 1e-2 M.

So, 64.468 x=0.01.

So x=0.01 /64.468 ≈0.0001551 M.

So, the fractions are (each species)/(total)= (each)/(64.468 x).

So [CoSCN^+] =0.9 x → fraction is 0.9/64.468 → ~0.01396 →1.396%.

[Co(SCN)_2^0] is 3.6 x → fraction 3.6/64.468 → ~0.0556 →5.56%.

[Co(SCN)_3^-] is 22.68 x →22.68/64.468 → ~0.3518 →35.18%.

[Co(SCN)_4^2-] is 36.288 x →36.288/64.468 → ~0.5629 →56.29%.

Plus [Co^2+] is 1/64.468 → ~0.0155 →1.55%.

Wait, adding all fractions: 1.55 +1.396 +5.56 +35.18 +56.29≈100%, which checks out.

So the fraction for [Co(SCN)_2^0] is ~5.56%, but none of the options match this. The options are all higher, so perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the percentage of all dithiocyanato complexes, which includes both [Co(SCN)_2] and [Co(SCN)_4], but that doesn't make sense because the question specifies "blue dithiocyanato", which is the n=2 complex.

Alternatively, perhaps I have misunderstood the stability constants. Maybe the β values are for each step, but the way I'm using them is correct.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is that the given stability constants aren't in the correct order. Wait, the β values given are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

Wait, that's a bit odd because β4 is lower than β3. Usually, the stability increases up to a point and then may decrease, but that's not typical. Hmm, perhaps I should verify the order.

Wait, let me think again: β1 is for the first complex, β2 for the second, etc. So the [CoSCN^+] has β1=9, [Co(SCN)_2^0] has β2=40, [Co(SCN)_3^-] has β3=63, and [Co(SCN)_4^2-] has β4=16.

Wait, so according to this, the most stable complex is the third one, with β3=63, and the fourth is less stable, β4=16. That seems odd. So perhaps the formation of the fourth complex is less favored.

But wait, in the calculation, the [Co(SCN)_4^2-] term is 36.288 x, which is the largest term, contributing over 56% of the Co. So, the majority is the fourth complex.

Wait, but according to our earlier calculation, the [Co(SCN)_2^0] is only about 5.56%, which is the n=2 species. So, the problem is asking for that, but none of the options match.

Wait, perhaps I've misapplied the βs. Maybe the βs are not for each step but for the overall formation. Wait, no, that can't be. Because each β is a stepwise formation constant.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the problem is about the distribution of the species, but the SCN- concentration is 0.1 M, which is in large excess. So, perhaps most of the Co is complexed, but the exact distribution depends on the beta values.

Wait, let me try another approach. Let me compute the fraction again.

Sum is 1 +0.9 +3.6 +22.68 +36.288=64.468.

So, the fraction for n=2 is 3.6/64.468≈0.05557 →5.56%.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a wrong assumption about which β corresponds to which complex.

Wait, perhaps the order of the βs is different. Maybe the β for the second complex is β2=40, but perhaps the third is not as high.

Wait, wait: perhaps I should check if the βs are given in the order of the complexes. The problem states: "the stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63 and β4=16."

So β1 is for the first complex, β2 for the second, etc. So [CoSCN+] has β1=9, [Co(SCN)_2] has β2=40, [Co(SCN)_3] has β3=63, and [Co(SCN)_4] has β4=16.

Wait, but β4 is lower than β3. So perhaps higher complexes aren't as stable as the third one. So in the solution, the third complex is the most stable.

But in the sum earlier, the fourth complex had the highest term because β1β2β3β4=362880, which was multiplied by [SCN]^4=0.0001, giving 36.288.

Wait, but maybe that's not correct. Because β4 is 16, which is lower than β3=63. So when we multiply β3=63 by β4=16, the product is 1008, but wait, the [SCN] is 0.1, so [SCN]^4 is 0.0001.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating the terms. Let me recompute each term correctly.

Let me compute each term step by step:

n=0: 1.

n=1: β1 * [SCN] =9 *0.1=0.9.

n=2: β1 * β2 * [SCN]^2 =9 *40 * (0.1)^2 = 360 *0.01=3.6.

n=3: β1 * β2 * β3 * [SCN]^3=9*40*63 * (0.1)^3.

9 *40=360; 360*63=22680.

22680 * (0.1)^3 =22680 *0.001=22.68.

n=4: β1*β2*β3*β4 * [SCN]^4 =9*40*63*16 * (0.1)^4.

Compute 9*40=360, 360*63=22680, 22680 *16=362880.

(0.1)^4=0.0001 → 362880 *0.0001=36.288.

So the terms are correct.

But according to these, the [Co(SCN)_4^2-] has the highest fraction, about 56%. So the [Co(SCN)_2^0] has about 5.56%, which is way less than any of the options.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I have the βs in the wrong order. Maybe the βs are given for the complexes in a different order. Let me think: perhaps β1 is for the first complex (n=1), β2 for the second (n=2), β3 for the third (n=3), and β4 for the fourth (n=4). But the way I calculated the terms already considered β1 to β4 in order.

Another possibility: perhaps the question is asking for the sum of all species with two thiocyanate ions, which would include any possible complexes with two SCN, but I don't think that's the case. No, the question specifies the blue dithiocyanato complex, which is [Co(SCN)_2]^0.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the percentage as (3.6)/(sum) *100% = (3.6/64.468)*100 ≈5.557%, which is approximately 5.56%.

Since that's not in the options, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the total sum is wrong. Let me re-compute the sum:

1 +0.9=1.9

1.9+3.6=5.5

5.5+22.68=28.18

28.18+36.288=64.468.

Yes, that's correct.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the given β4 is higher than I thought. Oh wait, β4=16, which is lower than β3=63. So the fourth complex is less stable than the third. So in the solution, perhaps the third complex is the most abundant, followed by the fourth.

Wait, but in our calculation, the fourth complex has the highest term because (β1β2β3β4) [SCN]^4 is 36.288, which is higher than the third term (22.68). But that's because [SCN] is 0.1 M, so [SCN]^4 is 0.0001, but the product of the βs is higher.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the [SCN] concentration is 0.1 M, which is 1e-1, so when raised to higher powers, the denominator reduces it, but the numerator (product of βs) increases.

In our case, the sum is dominated by the n=4 term. So, the [Co(SCN)_4^2-] is the major species.

But the problem is asking for the blue dithiocyanato complex, which is n=2, which is only 5.56%, which isn't an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the way I'm calculating the fractions.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the fraction based on the βs and [SCN] as:

f_n = (β1 β2 ... βn [SCN]^n) / D,

where D is the sum of all (β1...βk [SCN]^k) for k=0 to 4.

But perhaps I should take into account that [SCN] is in high concentration, so perhaps the higher n terms are more significant.

Wait, but in our calculation, n=4 is the largest term. So the majority is in the fourth complex.

Wait, perhaps the β4 is not 16, but I think that's how the problem states it. Let me reread the question.

The problem says: stability constants are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63 and β4=16. So β4 is 16.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the [SCN] is 0.1 M, which is higher than the concentration where higher complexes are more stable. So let's see the log β values.

Wait, maybe the log K can give an idea of the stability. But that's probably not helpful here.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the question is asking for the percentage of all dithiocyanato complexes, which would include [Co(SCN)_2] and [Co(SCN)_4], but I think that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the calculation is not correct. Let me think of another way.

Wait, perhaps the stability constants should be used as follows. The fraction for each complex is:

f_n = ( [Co(SCN)_n] ) / ( [Co^2+] + [CoSCN^+] + [Co(SCN)2^0] + [Co(SCN)3^-] + [Co(SCN)4^2-] )

Which can be written as:

f_n = (β1 β2 ... βn [SCN]^n [Co^2+] ) / ( [Co^2+] (1 + β1 [SCN] + β1 β2 [SCN]^2 + β1 β2 β3 [SCN]^3 + β1 β2 β3 β4 [SCN]^4 ) )

So [Co^2+] cancels out, and f_n = (β1 β2 ... βn [SCN]^n ) / D,

where D is the sum as before.

So, the calculation is correct, and the fraction is 5.56% for n=2.

But since this isn't an option, I must have made a wrong assumption.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the [SCN] is 0.1 M, but the total concentration of SCN is much higher than the sum of the products, leading to a different distribution.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the formation of each complex in sequence. Let me model the formation step by step.

The initial concentration of Co^2+ is x, and [SCN^-] is 0.1 M.

The first step: Co^2+ + SCN^- ↔ CoSCN^+.

The formation constant K1=β1=9.

So, at equilibrium, [CoSCN^+] = β1 [Co^2+][SCN^-] =9x *0.1=0.9x.

The second step: CoSCN^+ + SCN^- ↔ Co(SCN)_2^0.

Formation constant K2=β2=40.

So, [Co(SCN)_2^0] = K2 [CoSCN^+][SCN^-] =40 *0.9x *0.1 =3.6x.

Third step: Co(SCN)_2^0 + SCN^- ↔ Co(SCN)_3^-.

K3=β3=63.

[Co(SCN)_3^-] =63 *3.6x *0.1=22.68x.

Fourth step: Co(SCN)_3^- + SCN^- ↔ Co(SCN)_4^2-.

K4=β4=16.

[Co(SCN)_4^2-] =16 *22.68x *0.1=36.288x.

So, the total Co is x +0.9x +3.6x +22.68x +36.288x=64.468x=0.01 M.

So x=0.01 /64.468≈1.55e-4 M.

So, the fractions are:

x/(64.468x) =1/64.468 ≈1.55%.

0.9x/(64.468x)=0.9/64.468≈1.396%.

3.6x/(64.468x)=5.56%.

22.68x/(64.468x)=35.18%.

36.288x/(64.468x)=56.29%.

So, the blue dithiocyanato is 5.56%, which is not among the options.

But the options are much higher. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the complexes.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the percentage of all species that are dithiocyanato, which would include any complex with two SCN, but in this case, only the second complex ([Co(SCN)_2^0]) has two SCN. So the percentage is 5.56%, which isn't an option.

This is confusing. Maybe the β constants are given in a different order. What if β1 is for the [Co(SCN)_2^0] complex, β2 for [Co(SCN)_3^-], etc.? But that's unlikely because β1 is first.

Alternatively, perhaps the β values are given in the order of the most stable to least, but I don't think that's the case.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato in the solution, but considering that the solution also contains free Co^2+ and other complexes. So perhaps another approach is needed.

Wait, maybe I should calculate the fraction differently. Let me think about the cumulative formation.

Total concentration of Co is 1e-2 M.

The fraction of [Co(SCN)_2^0] is (β1 β2 [SCN]^2) / (1 + β1 [SCN] + β1 β2 [SCN]^2 + β1 β2 β3 [SCN]^3 + β1 β2 β3 β4 [SCN]^4 ).

So plug in the numbers:

β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

[SCN]=0.1 M.

Compute numerator:9 *40 * (0.1)^2= 360 *0.01=3.6.

Denominator:1 +9*0.1 + 3.6 +9 *40 *63*(0.1)^3 +9 *40 *63 *16*(0.1)^4.

Wait, no, denominator is 1 + β1 [SCN] + β1 β2 [SCN]^2 + β1 β2 β3 [SCN]^3 + β1 β2 β3 β4 [SCN]^4.

So compute each term:

Term0:1.

Term1:9*0.1=0.9.

Term2:3.6.

Term3:9*40*63*(0.1)^3=22680 *0.001=22.68.

Term4:9*40*63*16*(0.1)^4=362880 *0.0001=36.288.

Sum=1 +0.9 +3.6 +22.68 +36.288=64.468.

So fraction is 3.6/64.468≈5.56%.

Same result. So again, not matching any options.

But since none of the options are close to 5.5%, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem setup.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using log βs or something else? Or perhaps the stability constants are given in a different way, like for the overall reaction.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the βs are for the overall complex formation, not stepwise. For example, β1 is for [CoSCN]^+, β2 is for [Co(SCN)_2]^0, etc.

But that's not the usual way stability constants are presented. Usually, βs are stepwise. So I'm probably correct in using them as stepwise.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the overall β for each complex, not stepwise. Let me try that.

If that's the case, then the overall β for [CoSCN^+] is β1=9.

For [Co(SCN)_2^0], the overall β is β2=40.

For [Co(SCN)_3^-], β3=63.

For [Co(SCN)_4^2-], β4=16.

Then, the formation of each complex is from Co^2+ and n SCN^-.

In that case, the fraction for each species is given by:

f_n = (β_n [SCN]^n) / (sum_{k=0 to 4} β_k [SCN]^k )

But wait, for n=0, f0=1 / (sum βk [SCN]^k).

Wait, but wait, if the βs are overall, then the formula would be:

f_n = (β_n [SCN]^n) / (1 + β1 [SCN] + β2 [SCN]^2 + β3 [SCN]^3 + β4 [SCN]^4 )

So in this case, let's compute each term.

n=0:1.

n=1: β1 [SCN]=9 *0.1=0.9.

n=2:β2 [SCN]^2=40 *0.01=0.4.

n=3:β3 [SCN]^3=63 *0.001=0.063.

n=4:β4 [SCN]^4=16 *0.0001=0.0016.

Sum=1 +0.9 +0.4 +0.063 +0.0016=2.3646.

So, the fraction for n=2 is 0.4/2.3646≈0.169 →16.9%.

Looking at the options, option D is 16.9%. So that's the answer.

So, the mistake was in assuming that the βs were stepwise. But in this alternative approach, treating βs as overall stability constants, the fraction for n=2 is 16.9%, which is option D.

But wait, I thought βs are usually stepwise, but perhaps in this problem, they're given as overall βs.

Wait, the question says: "the stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63 and β4=16."

So, perhaps each β represents the overall stability of the corresponding complex.

In that case, the fraction is 0.4/2.3646≈16.9%, which is option D.

But I'm a bit confused because usually, stability constants are given as stepwise. However, in some cases, they might be given as overall constants.

So, given that the options don't match the earlier calculation, perhaps the intended approach was to treat βs as overall constants, leading to option D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)₂]⁰, among all cobalt-containing species in the solution, we use the stability constants (β values) provided: β₁ = 9, β₂ = 40, β₃ = 63, and β₄ = 16. The total cobalt concentration is 10⁻² M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Interpretation of Stability Constants**:  
   The stability constants are given as overall stability constants for each complex, not stepwise constants. This means:
   - β₁ = 9 corresponds to [CoSCN⁺].
   - β₂ = 40 corresponds to [Co(SCN)₂]⁰.
   - β₃ = 63 corresponds to [Co(SCN)₃]⁻.
   - β₄ = 16 corresponds to [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻.

2. **Fraction of Each Species**:  
   The fraction of each cobalt species is calculated using the formula:
   \[
   f_n = \frac{\beta_n [\text{SCN}]^n}{\sum_{k=0}^{4} \beta_k [\text{SCN}]^k}
   \]
   Here, \( [\text{SCN}] = 0.1 \, \text{M} \), and \( \beta_k \) represents the overall stability constant for the \( k \)-th complex.

3. **Compute Each Term**:  
   - For \( n = 0 \):  
     \[
     f_0 = \frac{1}{1 + \beta_1 [\text{SCN}] + \beta_2 [\text{SCN}]^2 + \beta_3 [\text{SCN}]^3 + \beta_4 [\text{SCN}]^4}
     \]
   - For \( n = 1 \):  
     \[
     f_1 = \frac{\beta_1 [\text{SCN}]}{\sum_{k=0}^{4} \beta_k [\text{SCN}]^k}
     \]
   - For \( n = 2 \):  
     \[
     f_2 = \frac{\beta_2 [\text{SCN}]^2}{\sum_{k=0}^{4} \beta_k [\text{SCN}]^k}
     \]
   - For \( n = 3 \):  
     \[
     f_3 = \frac{\beta_3 [\text{SCN}]^3}{\sum_{k=0}^{4} \beta_k [\text{SCN}]^k}
     \]
   - For \( n = 4 \):  
     \[
     f_4 = \frac{\beta_4 [\text{SCN}]^4}{\sum_{k=0}^{4} \beta_k [\text{SCN}]^k}
     \]

4. **Substitute Values**:  
   - \( n = 0 \): Term = 1.
   - \( n = 1 \): \( \beta_1 [\text{SCN}] = 9 \cdot 0.1 = 0.9 \).
   - \( n = 2 \): \( \beta_2 [\text{SCN}]^2 = 40 \cdot (0.1)^2 = 0.4 \).
   - \( n = 3 \): \( \beta_3 [\text{SCN}]^3 = 63 \cdot (0.1)^3 = 0.063 \).
   - \( n = 4 \): \( \beta_4 [\text{SCN}]^4 = 16 \cdot (0.1)^4 = 0.0016 \).

   The denominator is the sum of all terms:
   \[
   \text{Sum} = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646
   \]

5. **Fraction of [Co(SCN)₂]⁰**:  
   The fraction of the blue dithiocyanato complex is:
   \[
   f_2 = \frac{0.4}{2.3646} \approx 0.169 \, \text{or} \, 16.9\%.
   \]

### Conclusion:
The percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)₂]⁰, among all cobalt-containing species in the solution is **16.9%**.
