Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me read it again. The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2.

Wait, okay, the operator P has components P_x, P_y, P_z. Each is given as ħ/2 multiplied by a 2x2 matrix. I remember that the total operator P is the vector sum of these components multiplied by the direction vector n. So P = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z. But since n is in the x-z plane, that means the y-component of n is zero. So n is (n_x, 0, n_z). Oh wait, but n must be a unit vector, so n_x² + n_z² = 1.

But wait, the question is about finding the eigenvector for P with eigenvalue ħ/2. So I need to write the matrix form of P and find its eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue ħ/2.

Let me think about each component matrix.

P_x is (ħ/2) multiplied by [[0,1],[1,0]].
P_y is (ħ/2) multiplied by [[0,-i],[i,0]].
P_z is (ħ/2) multiplied by [[1,0],[0,-1]].

So, the actual operator P is n_x P_x + 0*P_y + n_z P_z. Because n is in x-z plane, n_y is zero. So P becomes (n_x (ħ/2) [[0,1],[1,0]]) + (n_z (ħ/2) [[1,0],[0,-1]]).

Let me compute the matrix elements of P.

Breaking it down, each term's matrix:

n_x (ħ/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]] = [[0, n_x ħ/2], [n_x ħ/2, 0]]

n_z (ħ/2) * [[1,0],[0,-1]] = [[n_z ħ/2, 0], [0, -n_z ħ/2]]

Adding these together, the matrix P becomes:

[ [n_z ħ/2, n_x ħ/2],
  [n_x ħ/2, -n_z ħ/2] ]

Wait, but n_x and n_z are real numbers, and since n is a unit vector, n_x² + n_z² = 1.

So, the operator P is:

(ħ/2) * [ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ]

Wait, let me check that again. The (1,1) element is n_z*(ħ/2) + 0 from P_x. The (1,2) is n_x * (ħ/2) from P_x. Similarly, (2,1) is same as (1,2). And (2,2) is -n_z*(ħ/2).

So, the matrix P is:

[ [n_z*(ħ/2), n_x*(ħ/2)],
  [n_x*(ħ/2), -n_z*(ħ/2)] ]

So, to find the eigenvector, I need to solve P |v> = (ħ/2) |v>.

Wait, because the eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2.

So the equation is:

P |v> = (ħ/2) |v>

Which can be written as (P - (ħ/2) I) |v> = 0.

So (P - (ħ/2) I) is the matrix:

[ [n_z*(ħ/2) - ħ/2, n_x*(ħ/2) ],
  [n_x*(ħ/2), -n_z*(ħ/2) - ħ/2] ]

Simplify each element:

(1,1): (n_z - 1) (ħ/2)
(1,2): n_x (ħ/2)
(2,1): n_x (ħ/2)
(2,2): (-n_z -1) (ħ/2)

So, the matrix is:

[ (n_z - 1) (ħ/2)      n_x (ħ/2) ) ]
[ n_x (ħ/2)        (-n_z -1) (ħ/2) ) ]

Wait, but since ħ/2 is a common factor, I can factor that out. So the equation becomes:

[ [n_z - 1, n_x],
  [n_x, -n_z -1] ] * |v> = 0

Because (P - (ħ/2) I) = (ħ/2) * [ [n_z -1, n_x], [n_x, -n_z -1] ]

So, the equation is [ [n_z -1, n_x], [n_x, -n_z -1] ] multiplied by the vector (a, b) equals zero.

Setting up the equations:

(n_z - 1) a + n_x b = 0
n_x a + (-n_z -1) b = 0

These are two equations. Let me write them:

1) (n_z - 1) a + n_x b = 0
2) n_x a + (-n_z - 1) b = 0

We can write this as a homogeneous system. For non-trivial solutions, the determinant must be zero. Let's compute the determinant of the coefficient matrix.

Determinant D = (n_z -1)(-n_z -1) - (n_x)^2

Compute D:

= [(-n_z)(n_z -1) -1*(n_z -1)] 
Wait, expand (n_z -1)(-n_z -1):

= -(n_z)^2 -n_z + n_z +1 = -(n_z)^2 + 1.

So D = [ -(n_z)^2 +1 ] - (n_x)^2.

But since n_x² + n_z² = 1, because n is a unit vector in x-z plane (n_y=0), so n_x² + n_z² =1.

So D = (1 - n_z²) - n_x² = 1 - (n_z² + n_x²) = 1 -1 = 0.

So determinant is zero, which makes sense because we're looking for eigenvalues, so non-trivial solutions exist.

So, the two equations are dependent. Let's take the first equation:

(n_z -1) a + n_x b = 0

We can express a in terms of b or vice versa.

Let me solve for a:

a = [ -n_x / (n_z -1) ] * b

But if n_z is not 1, which would mean n is along positive z direction. But if n_z is 1, then the denominator is zero, but let's assume n_z !=1 for now.

So, the eigenvector can be written as (a, b) = [ -n_x/(n_z -1) * b, b ]

I can write the eigenvector as proportional to ( -n_x, (n_z -1) )

Wait, because a = [ -n_x/(n_z -1) ] b → a/(b) = -n_x/(n_z -1 )

So, the vector is proportional to ( -n_x, n_z -1 )

So, the eigenvector is any scalar multiple of ( -n_x, n_z -1 )

Wait, but when n_z is 1, this leads to division by zero. So we need to handle that case separately. But for now, let's proceed under the assumption that n_z is not 1.

So, the eigenvector is ( -n_x, n_z -1 )

But wait, let's double-check with the second equation. Let's plug a and b into the second equation.

Equation 2: n_x a + (-n_z -1) b = 0

Substitute a = [ -n_x/(n_z -1) ] b:

n_x [ (-n_x b)/(n_z -1) ] + (-n_z -1) b = 0

Factor out b:

b [ -n_x^2/(n_z -1)  + (-n_z -1) ] = 0

Simplify inside the brackets:

= [ (-n_x²) + (-n_z -1)(n_z -1) ) ] / (n_z -1 )

Wait, because the terms have a denominator only for the first term. Let me compute the numerator.

Wait, alternative approach: Let me compute the numerator:

- n_x² + (-n_z -1)(n_z -1) = -n_x² + [ (-n_z)(n_z -1) -1(n_z -1) ]

= -n_x² + [ -n_z^2 +n_z -n_z +1 ]

= -n_x² + [ -n_z^2 +0 +1 ]

= -n_x² -n_z^2 +1

But since n_x² + n_z²=1,

= -(1 -n_z²) -n_z² +1 ?

Wait, no, let's compute directly:

= -n_x² - n_z^2 +1.

But since n_x² + n_z² =1, 1= n_x² + n_z² → -n_x² - n_z^2 = - (n_x² +n_z^2) = -1.

So, the numerator is (-1) +1 = 0.

So the whole expression is zero. So yes, equation 2 is satisfied. So, the solution is correct.

So, the eigenvector is proportional to ( -n_x, n_z -1 )

But wait, the question is in the x-z plane, so n has components n_x and n_z. But I think it's better to express the eigenvector in terms of angles. Since n is arbitrary in the x-z plane, we can represent it as (cosθ, 0, sinθ) for some angle θ. Or wait, perhaps using spherical coordinates, but since it's in x-z plane, the angle from the z-axis would be θ, with n_x = sinθ cosφ, n_z = cosθ, but since it's in x-z plane, phi would be zero or 180 degrees? Wait, in x-z plane, the angle φ (azimuthal) is 0 or π, so n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ.

Wait, I think I might be getting confused here. Let me think again. In spherical coordinates, a point is represented as (r, θ, φ), where θ is the polar angle from the z-axis, and φ is the azimuthal angle around the z-axis. But since n is in the x-z plane, φ is either 0 or π (or any multiple, but the direction is along x-z plane). So for simplicity, let's assume φ=0, so the direction is in x-z plane, making n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ.

Wait, no, sinθ is the x component when φ=0, because in spherical coordinates, x = r sinθ cosφ, z= r cosθ. If φ=0, then x = r sinθ. If r=1, then n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ.

So, n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ.

So, substituting back into the eigenvector components.

Eigenvector is ( -n_x, n_z -1 )

So, substituting:

- n_x = - sinθ

n_z -1 = cosθ -1

So, the components are (- sinθ, cosθ -1 )

But wait, this is the vector before normalization. The eigenvector is in the direction of this vector.

But wait, the eigenvalue is +ħ/2. So, this eigenvector corresponds to that eigenvalue.

But wait, for a spin-1/2 system, the eigenvectors for spin in direction n correspond to spin-up and spin-down. The spin-up state has eigenvalue +ħ/2, spin-down has -ħ/2.

Wait, but the problem is about the operator P, which could be analogous to the spin operator.

So, the eigenvector is proportional to ( -n_x, n_z -1 ), which with n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ, becomes ( -sinθ, cosθ -1 )

But wait, I'm not sure if this is correct. Let me think about the standard spin-up state along z-axis. When n is along +z, n_x=0, n_z=1.

So, substituting into the vector, we get (0, 1-1=0), which can't be right. So in that case, the eigenvector would be (0,0), which is not possible. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, maybe I should approach this differently. Let me think about the general case for spin operator.

In quantum mechanics, the spin operator along a direction n is S = (ħ/2) ( σ · n ), where σ are the Pauli matrices.

Wait, but the problem defines P as the operator, which would be analogous to the spin operator. So, the eigenstates of P would be the eigenstates of the spin along n.

The eigenstates for spin-up and spin-down along n are given by:

|+> = cos(θ/2)|0> + e^{iφ} sin(θ/2)|1>
|-> = -e^{iφ} sin(θ/2)|0> + cos(θ/2)|1>

But since our n is in the x-z plane, φ=0 or π. Let's assume φ=0 for simplicity, so we can ignore the exponential.

So, the spin-up state would be cos(θ/2)|0> + sin(θ/2)|1>.

But wait, the eigenvalue equation is P |+> = (ħ/2) |+>.

Wait, but let's think about how θ is defined here. If n is in x-z plane, then in spherical coordinates, the polar angle θ is measured from the z-axis. So, for a direction along x, θ=90 degrees, and along z, θ=0.

Wait, so for a general direction in the x-z plane, the state |+> would be cos(θ/2)|0> + sin(θ/2)|1> ?

Wait, no, perhaps the standard parameterization is different. Let me think again.

In the case where n is along the z-axis, θ=0, so cos(theta/2)=1, sin(theta/2)=0. So the state is |0>, which is correct for spin-up along z.

If n is along the x-axis, theta=90 degrees (pi/2 radians), then cos(theta/2)=cos(pi/4)=sqrt(2)/2, sin(theta/2)=sqrt(2)/2. So the state is (1/sqrt(2))(1,1), which is correct for spin-up along x.

Hmm, that seems right.

But in our problem, the eigenvector components are (a, b) such that P |v> = (ħ/2)|v>.

So, the eigenvector would be along the direction cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2).

Wait, but our earlier approach using the matrix gave a different result. So perhaps I made a mistake in the matrix approach, and the correct way is to think about the spin eigenstates.

So, going back, the eigenvector for spin-up along n is ( cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ), where theta is the polar angle (from z-axis) of n.

Wait, but wait, in this problem, the operator P is constructed from P_x, P_y, P_z, which are like the spin components. So, yes, this should be correct.

But wait, the options given in the problem are:

Option C: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2))

Option B: (cos theta, e^{i phi} sin theta )

Option D: (sqrt(2/3) hbar cos(theta/2), sqrt(1/3) hbar sin(theta/2) )

Hmm.

Wait, wait. Let me think. Wait, the spin-up state is:

|+⟩ = ( cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) )

But in our case, since n is in the x-z plane, phi is zero, so e^{i phi}=1. So the state would be ( cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ).

Looking at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which matches.

But wait, option C is the first component as cos(theta/2), second as sin(theta/2), so that's what I have. So the eigenvector would be option C.

But the problem says the operator is P, which is analogous to the spin operator. So the eigenvector would be option C.

But wait, let me check the normalization. The eigenvector components (a, b) must satisfy |a|^2 + |b|^2 =1.

So, for option C, |cos(theta/2)|^2 + |sin(theta/2)|^2 = cos^2(theta/2) + sin^2(theta/2) = 1, so it's normalized.

So the correct answer is option C.

Wait, but earlier when I tried to compute by solving the matrix, I had a different result. So perhaps I made a mistake in that approach.

Wait, perhaps I should try substituting the eigenvector into the matrix equation to check.

Let me consider the matrix P. Let me compute P acting on the vector (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Wait, let me compute P |v> where |v> = (cos a, sin a), with a = theta/2.

Compute P |v> = (P_x |v> + P_y |v> + P_z |v> ) ? No, wait, no. Wait, P is the operator along n, which is in x-z plane, so P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

Wait, so P = (sin theta) P_x + (cos theta) P_z.

So, compute P |v> where |v> is (cos a, sin a), a= theta/2.

Compute each component:

P_x |v> = (ħ/2) [[0,1],[1,0]] (cos a, sin a) = (ħ/2)( sin a, cos a )

P_z |v> = (ħ/2) [[1,0],[0,-1]] (cos a, sin a) = (ħ/2)( cos a, - sin a )

So, P |v> = (sin theta) P_x |v> + (cos theta) P_z |v> 

= (ħ/2) [ sin theta ( sin a, cos a ) + cos theta ( cos a, - sin a ) ]

Let me compute each component:

First component:

sin theta * sin a * (ħ/2) + cos theta * cos a * (ħ/2)

Second component:

sin theta * cos a * (ħ/2) - cos theta * sin a * (ħ/2)

Factor out (ħ/2):

= (ħ/2) [ sin theta sin a + cos theta cos a, sin theta cos a - cos theta sin a ]

Notice that the first component is cos(theta - a).

The second component is sin(theta - a).

Wait, because cos(theta - a) = cos theta cos a + sin theta sin a.

And sin(theta - a) = sin theta cos a - cos theta sin a.

So,

P |v> = (ħ/2) [ cos(theta - a), sin(theta - a) ]

But a is theta/2. So,

theta - a = theta - theta/2 = theta/2.

So,

P |v> = (ħ/2) [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]

Which is the same as (ħ/2) |v>.

So, this shows that (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)) is indeed an eigenvector with eigenvalue ħ/2.

So, the correct answer is option C: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Looking back at the options, option C is exactly that. So the answer is C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we are tasked with finding the normalized eigenvector of the operator $\vec{P}$ along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The operator $\vec{P}$ is constructed from its components $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$, which are given as $\hbar/2$ multiplied by specific 2x2 matrices. Since $\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane, the y-component of $\vec{n}$ is zero, and $\vec{P}$ simplifies to $P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z$, where $n_x^2 + n_z^2 = 1$ (as $\vec{n}$ is a unit vector).

### Step 1: Matrix Form of $\vec{P}$
The components of $\vec{P}$ are:
- $P_x = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}$,
- $P_y = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{bmatrix}$,
- $P_z = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix}$.

Since $\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane, $P_y$ does not contribute, and $\vec{P}$ becomes:
\[
P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} n_z & n_x \\ n_x & -n_z \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 2: Eigenvalue Equation
The eigenvalue equation is:
\[
P |v\rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} |v\rangle,
\]
where $|v\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix}$ is the eigenvector. Substituting $P$ into the equation:
\[
\frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} n_z & n_x \\ n_x & -n_z \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix}.
\]
Dividing through by $\frac{\hbar}{2}$, we get:
\[
\begin{bmatrix} n_z & n_x \\ n_x & -n_z \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 3: Solving for the Eigenvector
This leads to the system of equations:
1. $(n_z - 1)a + n_x b = 0$,
2. $n_x a + (-n_z - 1)b = 0$.

These equations are consistent and dependent, so we solve for $a$ and $b$ in terms of one variable. Assuming $n_x = \sin\theta$ and $n_z = \cos\theta$ (since $\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane), the eigenvector is proportional to:
\[
\begin{bmatrix} -n_x \\ n_z - 1 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} -\sin\theta \\ \cos\theta - 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 4: Normalization and Final Form
The eigenvector must be normalized, so we divide by its norm. For a spin-1/2 system, the normalized eigenvector for spin-up along $\vec{n}$ is:
\[
|+\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} \cos(\theta/2) \\ \sin(\theta/2) \end{bmatrix}.
\]
This matches the standard spin-up state in quantum mechanics, which is normalized and corresponds to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$.

### Step 5: Analyzing the Options
- **Option A**: $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar, \sqrt{1/3}\hbar)$ is incorrect because it does not match the standard spin-up state.
- **Option B**: $(\cos\theta, e^{i\phi}\sin\theta)$ is incorrect because it corresponds to a different parameterization and does not match the spin-up state.
- **Option C**: $(\cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2))$ is correct, as it matches the normalized spin-up state.
- **Option D**: $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar \cos(\theta/2), \sqrt{1/3}\hbar \sin(\theta/2))$ is incorrect because it introduces unnecessary scaling factors.

### Final Answer
The normalized eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$ is:
\[
\begin{bmatrix} \cos(\theta/2) \\ \sin(\theta/2) \end{bmatrix}.
\]
