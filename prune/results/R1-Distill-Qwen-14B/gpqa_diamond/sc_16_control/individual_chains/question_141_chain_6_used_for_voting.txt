Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it. Let's see what the question is.

The question says: 1-bromobenzene-2-d is treated with NaNH2 in condensed ammonia solvent. How many possible organic products are there in this reaction? The options are A) 4, B) 1, C) 2, D) 3.

Hmm, I remember that NaNH2 is a strong base, often used in dehydrohalogenation reactions, like elimination. And condensed ammonia solvent is something like liquid NH3. Wait, that's right, it's used for elimination reactions, especially for dehydrohalogenation to form alkenes.

Wait, but the starting material is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. Wait, benzene rings with substituents... Wait, wait, benzene is a six-membered ring. So 1-bromobenzene would have a bromine in the first position, but wait, the numbering here is 1 and 2? Oh wait, the compound is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. Wait, maybe it's 1-bromo-2-deutero benzene? So, benzene with a Br at position 1 and a deuterium (D) at position 2.

Wait, but wait—benzene is symmetric, so positions 1 and 2 are adjacent. So the molecule is bromobenzene with a deuterium on the adjacent carbon.

Wait, but in any case, the reaction is with NaNH2 in ammonia. That's a dehydrohalogenation condition, which usually leads to elimination, forming a double bond. But wait, in aromatic compounds? Or maybe it's a di-substituted benzene ring.

Wait, wait, wait. Let me think again. 1-bromobenzene-2-d would be bromobenzene with a deuterium on the adjacent carbon. So the structure is a benzene ring with Br at position 1 and a D at position 2.

Now, treating with NaNH2 in ammonia. So NaNH2 is a strong base, and in ammonia, it's a good solvent for such elimination reactions. So I think this is an E2 elimination. But wait, in aromatic compounds, elimination usually isn't possible because the ring is stable. Unless it's a benzylic position.

Wait, but benzene is already an aromatic ring. So if the Br is attached directly to the ring, then elimination would have to form a double bond in the ring, but that's not possible because the ring is already fully conjugated. So that can't happen. So maybe this is a case of dehydrohalogenation, but in this case, perhaps it's a meta-directing group?

Wait, no, maybe the Br is attached to a carbon that's not part of the benzene ring? Wait, wait, no, 1-bromobenzene is Br directly attached to the ring. So the carbon with Br is part of the ring. So, in that case, where would the elimination happen? Maybe it's not elimination. Or perhaps I'm thinking about this wrong.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe the starting material isn't benzene but a substituted toluene or something. Oh wait, no, the compound is 1-bromobenzene-2-d, which I think is a benzene ring with a Br and a D in positions 1 and 2, respectively.

Wait, but if you have a Br attached to a benzene ring, and you treat it with a strong base like NaNH2, what reaction occurs? Maybe it's a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but that typically requires activating groups on the ring. Br is a deactivating group, making the ring less reactive towards nucleophilic substitution. So that might not be the case here.

Alternatively, maybe the base abstracts a proton, leading to the formation of a benzene ring with a double bond. But wait, benzene already has double bonds; that's not possible. Oh, wait, perhaps it's a matter of ring expansion or something else?

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, the base could deprotonate the ring, but again, benzene is pretty stable. Alternatively, maybe the base is abstracting a proton alpha to the Br, leading to elimination.

Wait, but wait, if the Br is on the ring and the D is on the adjacent carbon, perhaps the base abstracts a hydrogen adjacent to the Br. So, for example, in a benzene ring, positions 1 and 2 are adjacent. So the Br is on 1, D on 2. The base (NH2-) would abstract a hydrogen from position 3 or maybe another adjacent position, leading to the formation of a double bond between C2 and C3, but wait, but benzene is already a ring of conjugated double bonds.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is not elimination but something else, like a coupling reaction, but I don't think so. Another thought: Maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation to form a benzene ring with a double bond, but that would imply the ring isn't already fully conjugated. Wait, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the starting material isn't benzene but a mono-substituted benzene. Wait, 1-bromobenzene-2-d, so the substituents are Br and D on adjacent carbons. So, maybe the molecule is such that when the base abstracts a proton beta to the Br, elimination occurs, forming a double bond between the Br's position and the adjacent carbon.

Wait, for example, if the Br is on C1, and the D is on C2, and the base abstracts a hydrogen from C3, would that lead to a double bond between C1 and C2? But that's already part of the benzene ring. Hmm, maybe that's not possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts a hydrogen from a position that's next to the Br, causing the ring to lose a Br and form a double bond. Wait, but how?

Wait, maybe I'm confusing this with allylic bromides. Wait, in allylic bromides, you can have elimination to form alkenes, but in this case, the Br is directly on the ring. So perhaps the mechanism is different.

Wait, another angle: The structure is 1-bromo-2-deutero benzene. So the Br is on C1, D on C2. Now, when treated with a strong base like NaNH2, perhaps the base deprotonates a hydrogen adjacent to Br, leading to the formation of a double bond. But wait, in benzene, each carbon is connected to two others, and each has a hydrogen (except when substituted). So, perhaps the base abstracts a hydrogen from a neighboring position, leading to the formation of a new double bond, but in the ring.

Wait, but that would change the structure of the ring, which is already a conjugated system. I'm not sure how that's possible. Alternatively, maybe the Br is in the ortho position to the D.

Wait, perhaps the base abstracts a hydrogen from C3, leading to the formation of a double bond between C2 and C3. So the Br is on C1, D on C2, and a double bond between C2 and C3. But wait, in that case, the ring would then have a double bond between C2 and C3, but since the ring is already a benzene ring, that's part of the existing structure. So maybe that's not possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't occur, and no products are formed, but that's not an option here.

Wait, perhaps the reaction leads to the formation of a benzene ring with a double bond adjacent to the Br. But I'm not sure how that would happen.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about the possible products. When you eliminate HBr from a bromoarene, you form an aromatic ring with an additional double bond, meaning perhaps the ring becomes a larger system or forms a different structure. But I'm not too sure.

Alternatively, maybe the dehydrohalogenation leads to the formation of a benzene ring with a triple bond. No, that doesn't sound right.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a coupling reaction, but I don't think NaNH2 would cause that under these conditions.

Hmm, perhaps I need to think about the possibility of forming a di-substituted benzene with a double bond. But I'm not getting anywhere.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a benzidine-type elimination, but that requires specific conditions. Alternatively, maybe it's a case of forming a benzene ring with a substituent that can eliminate.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the reaction leads to the formation of a benzene ring with the loss of H and Br, forming a double bond. So, for instance, if the Br is on C1 and a D is on C2, and the base abstracts a hydrogen from C3, perhaps a double bond forms between C1 and C2, but that's already part of the ring.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to structure this.

The starting material is 1-bromo-2-d benzene. The reaction is with NaNH2 in ammonia, which is a dehydrohalogenation condition. So, dehydrohalogenation typically occurs when there's a possibility of forming a double bond.

In aliphatic compounds, elimination occurs when there's a hydrogen adjacent to the leaving group (like Br) that can be abstracted, leading to the formation of a double bond.

So in this case, the Br is on a benzene ring. Are there any hydrogens adjacent to the Br that can be abstracted? Well, the Br is on C1, so adjacent carbons are C2 and C6. But in the starting material, C2 has a D (deuterium), so perhaps the base can abstract a hydrogen from C6.

Wait, but then, if the base abstracts a hydrogen from C6, which is adjacent to C1 (Br), then elimination could occur, leading to the formation of a double bond between C1 and C6. But wait, that's part of the benzene ring, which already has a double bond between C1 and C2, and C2 and C3, etc. So, I'm not sure if that's feasible.

Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts a hydrogen from C3, which is adjacent to C2 (which has D). Then, elimination would form a double bond between C2 and C3. But wait, that's part of the existing ring structure. So that's already a double bond in benzene.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the structure. Or perhaps the reaction is not elimination but something else.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the deuterium is in a position that affects the reaction. Since D is a heavier isotope, maybe it affects the acidity of the adjacent hydrogen. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the D is on the same carbon as the Br? Wait, the compound is 1-bromo-2-d benzene, so the Br is on C1 and D on C2.

Wait, perhaps the base abstracts a hydrogen from C3, leading to the formation of a double bond between C2 and C3. But then, the Br is on C1, which is adjacent to C2. So, after elimination, the ring would have a double bond between C2 and C3, but that's part of the original structure.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Maybe the reaction leads to the loss of H and Br, forming a new double bond in the ring, but that would require the ring to change structure, which might not be possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed, so no products are formed. But that's not one of the options.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is not a benzene ring but a substituted cyclohexane or something else, but the question says benzene, so that's not it.

Hmm, maybe I should think about possible products. Let's imagine that elimination occurs, leading to a benzene ring with a double bond. But since the ring is already fully conjugated, that might not be possible. So perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed, leading to no products, but that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts a hydrogen from the benzene ring, resulting in a deprotonated benzene ring with a negative charge, but that's probably not stable under these conditions.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe the bromide is a good leaving group, and the base abstracts a proton, leading to the formation of a benzene ring with a double bond elsewhere. But I don't think that's feasible given the structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a coupling of some sort, but I don't remember NaNH2 being used for that.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about the possible products again. If the reaction is elimination, then perhaps the product is a benzene ring with a double bond adjacent to the Br. But I'm not sure how that would look.

Wait, perhaps the Br is on C1, and the D is on C2. The base abstracts a hydrogen from C3. Then, elimination would form a double bond between C2 and C3. But since the ring is benzene, that's already the case. So maybe the product is the same as the starting material, but that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the elimination leads to a ring contraction or expansion, but I don't think that's feasible.

Wait, perhaps the reaction leads to the formation of a benzene ring with a substituent that has a double bond, but I'm not seeing it.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation forming a new aromatic compound, like a naphthalene derivative. But I'm not familiar with that mechanism.

Alternatively, perhaps the Br leaves as Br-, and a new double bond forms, but that would require a transition state where the Br leaves and a double bond forms between adjacent carbons. So, for example, if Br is on C1, and the base abstracts a hydrogen from C2 (but wait, C2 has a D, not H), so maybe from C3.

Wait, maybe the base abstracts a hydrogen from C3, leading to the formation of a double bond between C2 and C3. Then the Br would leave as Br-, but wait, in that case, the ring would have a double bond between C2 and C3, which is part of the benzene ring. So that's not possible, as the ring is already a conjugated system.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for similar reactions or think about what NaNH2 does in different contexts. NaNH2 is used in dehydrohalogenation, such as in the formation of alkenes from bromoalkanes. For example, 1-bromoethane treated with NaNH2 would form ethylene.

But in aromatic systems, the mechanism might be different. Wait, perhaps the reaction is an elimination to form a benzene ring with a substituent that has a double bond. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another idea: Maybe the reaction is a ring-opening elimination. But benzene is very stable, so that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't do anything, so no products are formed, but that's not an option here.

Wait, perhaps the reaction forms a diradical or something, but I don't think that's the case.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about the number of possible products. The options include 1, 2, 3, or 4. So maybe the reaction leads to multiple products, like different isomers.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is 1-bromo-2-d benzene, and elimination leads to different possible products based on where the base abstracts a hydrogen.

But in this case, the starting material has Br on C1 and D on C2. So the adjacent positions are C2 (D) and C6. So if the base abstracts a hydrogen from C6, which is adjacent to C1 (Br), elimination would form a double bond between C1 and C6. But wait, that's part of the benzene ring, so perhaps the product is the same as the starting material.

Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts a hydrogen from C3 or C5, leading to different positions for the double bond.

Wait, but if the base abstracts a hydrogen from C3, elimination would form a double bond between C2 and C3, which is already part of the ring. So that's not feasible.

Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts a hydrogen from C4, leading to a double bond between C3 and C4. But again, that's part of the ring.

Hmm, perhaps I'm not seeing this correctly. Maybe the reaction isn't elimination but something else.

Wait, another angle: Maybe the reaction is a substitution, but I don't think NaNH2 is a nucleophile in this context. It's more of a base for elimination.

Wait, perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed, and the only product is the starting material, but that's not an option either.

Wait, maybe the reaction leads to the formation of a benzene ring with a double bond adjacent to the Br, but that's impossible because the ring is already fully conjugated. So perhaps the reaction doesn't occur, but that's not an option.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the base deprotonates the ring, leading to a benzene ring with a negative charge, but that would probably be resonance stabilized but I don't know what the product would be.

Alternatively, perhaps the D is involved in some way, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation leading to the formation of a benzene ring with a triple bond, but that's not feasible because you can't have a triple bond in a benzene ring.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I should think about what NaNH2 does in aromatic systems. Wait, I recall that NaNH2 is used in the Birch reduction, but that's a different solvent. Alternatively, in dehydrohalogenation reactions for alkenes.

Wait, but maybe in this case, the Br is on a benzene ring, and the base abstracts a hydrogen from a position adjacent to Br, leading to the formation of a new double bond. But in benzene, that's already the case.

Wait, perhaps the reaction forms a benzene ring with a substituent that's a double bond. But I'm not seeing how that would happen.

Wait, perhaps the reaction creates a new ring. For example, benzannulation, but I'm not sure how that would occur.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a coupling reaction, but I don't think so.

Alternatively, maybe the D is a hindrance. Since the D is on C2, which is adjacent to Br on C1, perhaps the base can't abstract a hydrogen from C2 because it's deuterated. So the base would abstract from C6, leading to one product.

But wait, if the base abstracts from C6, elimination would form a double bond between C1 and C6. But that's part of the benzene ring, so perhaps the ring just remains as it is, and the product is the same as the starting material.

Wait, but that can't be. So perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed, but then the number of products would be zero, which isn't an option.

Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the reaction leads to the formation of a benzene ring with a substituent that's a double bond, but I'm not sure how.

Wait, perhaps the reaction isn't elimination but a substitution, but I don't think so.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction forms a benzene ring with a substituent that's a hydrogen, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should look up similar reactions or think about the possible products again.

Wait, another approach: The reaction is dehydrohalogenation, which typically forms alkenes. So perhaps the product is a benzene ring with a substituent that's an alkene. But in this case, the Br is directly attached to the ring, so elimination would form a double bond in the ring, which isn't possible because the ring is already conjugated.

Wait, perhaps the product is a naphthalene derivative, but that would require a new ring to form.

Wait, maybe the reaction forms a benzine or something similar, but I'm not familiar with that.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction forms a benzyne intermediate, but that's usually under very strong basic conditions and involves a coupling reaction.

Wait, benzyne is a diradical or a triple bond in the ring, but that's not an aromatic structure. So perhaps under these conditions, the Br and D are eliminated, forming a triple bond, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but if the Br on C1 and D on C2 are eliminated, perhaps a triple bond forms between C1 and C2, making a ring with a triple bond. But that would require the loss of both Br and D, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but then the product would have a triple bond in the ring. But I'm not sure if that's possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction forms a benzene ring with an adjacent double bond, but that's already the case.

Wait, perhaps this reaction doesn't proceed, and no products are formed, but that's not an option.

Hmm, maybe I should think about the possible number of products. The options are 1, 2,3,4. So, perhaps the reaction leads to more than one product.

Wait, but if the base abstracts a hydrogen from two different positions, leading to different products, how many possibilities are there?

Wait, in the starting material, the Br is on C1, D on C2. The possible positions for hydrogen abstraction by the base would be C3 and C6, perhaps, because C2 has D and C1 has Br.

Wait, if the base abstracts a hydrogen from C3, elimination would form a double bond between C2 and C3. But that's already part of the benzene ring. So perhaps that's not a viable product.

Alternatively, if the base abstracts a hydrogen from C6, elimination would form a double bond between C1 and C6. But again, that's part of the ring.

Hmm, perhaps the reaction forms multiple products based on where the elimination occurs. But in this case, it's the same ring.

Wait, maybe the reaction forms a benzene ring with a substituent that's a double bond. But I'm not seeing that.

Wait, another thought: Perhaps the reaction is not elimination but an aromatic substitution, but I don't see how.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to the formation of a benzene ring with a substituent that's a hydrogen, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, maybe the reaction involves the loss of Br and D, forming a triple bond. So 1-bromo-2-d benzene would lose H and Br, forming a triple bond between C1 and C2. Would that be possible?

Wait, but the starting material has Br on C1 and D on C2. So if the base abstracts a hydrogen from C1 (but it's attached to Br), that's not possible. Alternatively, abstracting from C2, but that's D, not H.

Wait, perhaps the base abstracts a hydrogen from C6, leading to elimination of Br and formation of a double bond between C1 and C6. But that's part of the ring, so no change.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I should think about the possible products again.

Wait, perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed, so no products are formed. But the options don't include zero. So perhaps the answer is 1 product, but that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction forms a single product, which is the same as the starting material, but that's not possible.

Wait, perhaps the reaction forms a benzene ring with a substituent that's a double bond, but I'm not sure how.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction forms a benzene ring with a substituent that's a deuterium, but that's already the case.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation leading to a benzene ring with a substituent that's a triple bond. So, for example, forming a benzyne intermediate. But then, how many products?

Wait, if the reaction forms benzyne, which is a highly strained molecule, it might dimerize or undergo other reactions. But under the given conditions, perhaps it just forms a single product, which is the benzyne intermediate.

Wait, but benzyne is not stable and might not be considered a product in this context.

Hmm, perhaps I should go back to the basics. What is the structure of 1-bromobenzene-2-d? It's benzene with Br on C1 and D on C2.

When treated with NaNH2 in ammonia, a strong base is present. So perhaps the base abstracts a proton adjacent to the Br, leading to elimination of HBr and formation of a double bond.

But in benzene, that's not possible because the ring is already conjugated. So perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed, and no products are formed. But that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a coupling, forming a biphenyl structure, but I don't think so.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction forms a benzene ring with a substituent that's an alkene, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the reaction leads to the formation of a diene, but that's part of the ring.

Hmm, I'm not getting anywhere. Maybe I should think about the possible number of products again. The options are 1, 2,3,4.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is elimination, but the starting material has two possible positions for elimination, leading to two products.

Wait, if the base abstracts a hydrogen from C3 or C6, leading to different double bonds. But in benzene, those positions are already part of the ring, so perhaps that's not possible.

Alternatively, if the elimination leads to a different structure, like a benzene ring with a substituent that's a double bond, but I'm not seeing how.

Wait, perhaps the reaction leads to the formation of a benzene ring with a substituent that's a double bond, but that would require the formation of a new structure, which I'm not familiar with.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the base abstracts a hydrogen from a position that's meta to the Br, leading to a different product. But in benzene, that's possible. So if the Br is on C1, the meta positions are C3 and C5. So the base could abstract a hydrogen from C3 or C5, leading to elimination and forming double bonds in those positions.

But wait, in that case, the product would have a double bond between C1 and C2 (existing), and another between C3 and C4 (existing), but that's part of the ring. So perhaps that's not possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the elimination leads to the formation of a new double bond elsewhere in the ring, but again, the ring is already conjugated.

Hmm, this is really challenging. Maybe I should think about the possible products as being 2, as in option C.

Wait, but why 2? Perhaps because the base can abstract a hydrogen from two different positions, leading to two different products. For example, abstracting from C3 or C5, leading to two different products.

But wait, in benzene, those positions are symmetric, so perhaps only one product is formed.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to two different isomers, like para and ortho products.

Wait, but the starting material is 1-bromo-2-d benzene, so the substituents are adjacent. The products would depend on where the elimination occurs.

Wait, if the base abstracts a hydrogen from C3, elimination would form a double bond between C2 and C3. But that's already part of the ring. So no change.

Alternatively, if the base abstracts a hydrogen from C4, leading to a double bond between C3 and C4, which is also part of the ring.

Hmm, I'm really stuck here. Maybe the answer is B)1, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps the reaction doesn't form any products, but the options don't have that. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction forms only one product, which is a rearrangement.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction forms a benzene ring with a substituent that's a hydrogen, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this and the answer is 1 product. So option B.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The reaction involves 1-bromobenzene-2-d treated with NaNH₂ in condensed ammonia solvent. NaNH₂ is a strong base commonly used for dehydrohalogenation, which typically involves elimination to form alkenes. However, the starting material, 1-bromobenzene-2-d, is a benzene ring with bromine at position 1 and deuterium at position 2. 

In this case, elimination is challenging because the benzene ring is already fully conjugated, and forming a new double bond within the ring is not feasible. The base (NH₂⁻) could abstract a hydrogen atom adjacent to the bromine (e.g., from position 3 or 6), but this would not result in a new double bond since the ring is already aromatic. The deuterium at position 2 complicates the reaction further, as it is not easily abstracted by the base.

Given the structure of the starting material and the reaction conditions, it is unlikely that elimination or any other reaction pathway would produce a distinct product. The reaction either does not proceed or results in no change to the starting material. Since no new products are formed under these conditions, the number of possible organic products is zero. However, this option is not explicitly provided in the question.

Among the given options, the most plausible answer is that no distinct products are formed, which aligns with the reaction conditions and the structure of the starting material.

Answer: B
