Okay, so I've got this astronomy question in front of me, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll give it a shot. Let me read it again.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. So, number of stars N is proportional to 1/plx^5. And the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance r.

Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, parallax (plx) in parsecs is the reciprocal of distance (d) in parsecs. So plx = 1/d, which means d = 1/plx. So, as distance increases, parallax decreases.

Wait, the problem says N ∝ 1/plx^5. Let me write that as N = k * (1/plx)^5, where k is some constant. But since plx is 1/d, substituting that in, N would be proportional to (d)^5. Because (1/plx) is d, so d^5.

But wait, the question is asking about how the number of stars changes with distance. So, it's about the rate of change, like per unit distance. So probably we're looking for dN/dr, the derivative of N with respect to r (distance).

Let me think. If N = k * d^5, then dN/dr is 5k d^4. So, the number of stars increases with the fourth power of distance.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me make sure I'm not getting confused. The number of stars is proportional to d^5, so the rate at which the number of stars increases as you move to a higher distance would be this derivative.

But wait, the options are about how the number changes with distance, per unit range. Another way, per unit distance. So the change in N with distance, which is dN/dr.

So N is proportional to d^5, so dN/dr is 5*d^4. So that would make the number of stars increasing with r^4. So the answer is option C, which is r^4.

Wait, but I'm a bit unsure. Let me double-check the relationships. The number of stars varies with 1/plx^5, and since 1/plx is distance, N ∝ d^5. Then, the change in number with distance is the derivative. So yes, dN/dr ∝ r^4.

Alternatively, maybe I should think about it differently. Because when you have a distribution of stars, the number per unit volume would relate to how they are spread out. Oh, wait, but the question is about the number in a region as a function of distance. So perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, think about flux or density. Oh, wait, no, this is more about how the count changes with distance. So more stars are found at larger distances, given this 1/plx^5 relation.

So another approach: Let's express everything in terms of d.

Given N ∝ 1/plx^5. Since plx = 1/d, then 1/plx = d. So N ∝ d^5.

So N = K * d^5, where K is a constant.

The rate of change of N with respect to d is dN/dd = 5K d^4. So as d increases, the number of stars increases as the fourth power of d. So the answer would be r^4, which is option C.

Wait, but the question is phrased as "how does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?" So per unit distance, the change is dr. So the change would be the derivative, which is proportional to r^4.

So the correct answer should be C.

The question states that the number of stars \( N \) in a specific region of the sky varies with parallax \( \text{plx} \) as \( N \propto 1/\text{plx}^5 \). Since parallax is inversely related to distance (\( \text{plx} = 1/d \)), substituting this relationship gives \( N \propto d^5 \), where \( d \) is the distance. 

To determine how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance \( r \), we calculate the derivative of \( N \) with respect to \( d \). If \( N = K \cdot d^5 \) (where \( K \) is a constant), then:

\[
\frac{dN}{dd} = 5K \cdot d^4
\]

This shows that the rate of change of \( N \) with respect to \( d \) is proportional to \( d^4 \). Therefore, the number of stars increases with the fourth power of distance. Among the given options, the correct answer is \( \sim r^4 \).
