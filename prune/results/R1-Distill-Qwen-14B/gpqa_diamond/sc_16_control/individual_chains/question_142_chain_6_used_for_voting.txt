Okay, so I have this question about the density matrix of a qubit, and I'm trying to figure out where it's located in the qubits space. I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's in a mixed state. But wait, what's the geometrical position about? Oh right, in the Bloch sphere representation, any single qubit state can be represented as a point on or inside a unit sphere.

The given density matrix is ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). Hmm, let me think about what this represents. I recall that a pure state is a density matrix of the form |ψ⟩⟨ψ|, and it lies on the surface of the Bloch sphere. But this ρ looks like a mixture of |0⟩ and |1⟩ states. Oh yeah, because when the density matrix is a mixture, like a convex combination of projectors, it's a mixed state.

Wait, what's the general form of a density matrix for a mixed state of two basis states? I think it's ρ = p|0⟩⟨0| + (1-p)|1⟩⟨1|, where p is a probability between 0 and 1. But in this case, both terms have a coefficient of 1/2. So ρ = (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)/2. That means it's an equal mixture of the two states. So p is 0.5 here.

Now, how does this correspond to the Bloch vector? The Bloch sphere parametrization for a qubit's density matrix is given by ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices and r is a 3-dimensional vector (the Bloch vector) with |r| ≤ 1. So the density matrix can be written as (I + x X + y Y + z Z)/2, where X, Y, Z are the Pauli matrices, and r=(x,y,z).

Let me write out ρ in terms of the Pauli matrices. The given ρ is (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)/2. I know that |0⟩⟨0| can be written as (I + Z)/2, and similarly, |1⟩⟨1| is (I - Z)/2. So substituting these into ρ:

ρ = (1/2) [ (I + Z)/2 + (I - Z)/2 ]
= (1/2) [ (I + Z + I - Z)/2 ]
= (1/2) [ (2I)/2 ]
= (1/2) * I
= I/2.

Wait, so ρ is the identity matrix multiplied by 1/2. So ρ = I/2. That's interesting. Now, according to the Bloch sphere formula, ρ = (I + r·σ)/2. So if I set that equal to I/2, we have:

(I + r·σ)/2 = I/2.

Multiplying both sides by 2:

I + r·σ = I.

Subtracting I from both sides:

r·σ = 0.

Which means that the vector r must be zero because the sum of the Pauli matrices multiplied by r equals zero. So r is (0,0,0). Because if x, y, z are all zero, then r·σ is zero.

So the density matrix ρ is I/2, which is the completely mixed state. This corresponds to the center of the Bloch sphere. So the geometrical position is at the origin (0,0,0).

Looking at the options, option C is r=(0,0,0). So the answer should be option C.

The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( |0\rangle \langle 0| + |1\rangle \langle 1| \right).
\]

This represents a mixed state of the qubit, specifically an equal mixture of the states \(|0\rangle\) and \(|1\rangle\). To determine its geometrical position in the qubit space, we use the Bloch sphere representation, where the density matrix can be expressed as:

\[
\rho = \frac{I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}}{2},
\]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix, \(\boldsymbol{\sigma} = (X, Y, Z)\) are the Pauli matrices, and \(\mathbf{r} = (x, y, z)\) is the Bloch vector with \(|\mathbf{r}| \leq 1\).

For the given \(\rho\), we substitute \(|0\rangle \langle 0| = \frac{1}{2}(I + Z)\) and \(|1\rangle \langle 1| = \frac{1}{2}(I - Z)\) into the expression for \(\rho\):

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{1}{2}(I + Z) + \frac{1}{2}(I - Z) \right) = \frac{1}{2} \cdot I.
\]

Thus, \(\rho = \frac{I}{2}\), which corresponds to the completely mixed state. Comparing this with the Bloch sphere representation \(\rho = \frac{I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}}{2}\), we find:

\[
\frac{I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}}{2} = \frac{I}{2}.
\]

This implies \(\mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} = 0\), meaning the Bloch vector \(\mathbf{r}\) must be zero. Therefore, the geometrical position of the density matrix in the qubit space is at the origin \((0, 0, 0)\).

From the options provided, the correct answer is:

**A) \(r = (1, 1, 0)\)**  
**B) \(r = (0, 0, 1)\)**  
**C) \(r = (0, 0, 0)\)**  
**D) \(r = (1, 1, 1)\)**  

The correct choice is **C**, as the density matrix corresponds to the completely mixed state, which is at the center of the Bloch sphere.

Answer: C
