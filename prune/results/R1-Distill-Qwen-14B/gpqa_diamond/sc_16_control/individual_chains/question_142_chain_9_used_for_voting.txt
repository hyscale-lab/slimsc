Alright, so I have this quantum mechanics problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me take it step by step because I'm still pretty new to this.

The question is about the density matrix of a qubit. The given density matrix is ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). And the question is asking about its geometrical position in the qubits space. The options are A to D, with different coordinates.

Hmm, I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's in a mixed state. Pure states are described by density matrices that are projectors (like |ψ⟩⟨ψ|), but when you have a mixture, you have a convex combination of such projectors.

Wait, so the given matrix is (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|) multiplied by 1/2. That looks familiar. Oh right! That's a classical mixture of the |0⟩ and |1⟩ states, each with equal probability. So this would correspond to a completely mixed state for a single qubit.

I think in the Bloch sphere representation, the state of a qubit can be visualized. For a pure state |ψ⟩, the density matrix is |ψ⟩⟨ψ|, and in the Bloch sphere, that's a point on the surface. But for a mixed state, like this one, the density matrix is a mixture of the basis states.

The general form of a density matrix for a qubit is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices, and r is a vector in 3D space. The vector r determines the point on the Bloch sphere. For a pure state, the length of r is 1, placing it on the surface. For a mixed state, |r| < 1, so it's inside the sphere.

In our case, the given ρ is (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)/2. Let me compute that. The |0⟩⟨0| matrix is [[1,0],[0,0]], and |1⟩⟨1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. Adding them gives [[1,0],[0,1]], which is the identity matrix. Then, multiplied by 1/2, it's (1/2) I.

So ρ = (I)/2. Comparing this to the general form ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, that implies that r·σ must be zero. Because (I + 0)/2 = I/2.

If r·σ = 0, then each component of r multiplied by the corresponding Pauli matrix sums to zero. Let's write out r·σ = r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z. For this sum to be zero, each component of r must be zero. Because σ_x, σ_y, and σ_z are the Pauli matrices, which are linearly independent. Therefore, the only solution is r = (0,0,0).

Ah, so the density matrix here is the completely mixed state, which in the Bloch sphere corresponds to the origin. So the point r is (0,0,0).

Looking back at the options, option C is (0,0,0). So the correct answer should be C.

The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents a classical mixture of the states \(|0\rangle\) and \(|1\rangle\), each with equal probability, corresponding to a completely mixed state for a single qubit. In the Bloch sphere representation, the density matrix of a qubit can be written in the general form:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} \right),
\]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix, \(\boldsymbol{\sigma}\) are the Pauli matrices, and \(\mathbf{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z)\) is a vector in 3D space. For a pure state, \(\mathbf{r}\) lies on the surface of the Bloch sphere (\(|\mathbf{r}| = 1\)), while for a mixed state, \(\mathbf{r}\) lies inside the sphere (\(|\mathbf{r}| < 1\)).

In this case, the given \(\rho\) simplifies to \(\rho = \frac{I}{2}\), which matches the general form only if \(\mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} = 0\). This implies that \(\mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0)\), as the Pauli matrices are linearly independent. Therefore, the density matrix corresponds to the completely mixed state, which is represented by the origin in the Bloch sphere.

Among the options provided, the correct geometrical position of the density matrix in qubit space is:

**C) \(r = (0, 0, 0)\)**.
