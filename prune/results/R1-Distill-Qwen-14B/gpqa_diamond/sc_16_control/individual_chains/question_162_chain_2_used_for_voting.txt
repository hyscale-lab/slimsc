Okay, so I have this metric given, and I need to find the area of a pseudosphere with radius r=2. Hmm, let me think.

Wait, what do I remember about pseudospheres? Oh right, pseudospheres are maximally symmetric solutions to Einstein's equations in certain contexts, like in 2D spacetime. But wait, the metric given here looks like a 2-dimensional metric, right? Because it's got dx² and dy² terms.

Looking at the metric: ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). That denominator looks like 4 - (x² + y²). Oh wait, because the radius r is 2, and the pseudosphere's metric in 2D usually has a form like (r²/(r² - x² - y²)) (dx² + dy²), but maybe with a different coefficient. Wait, actually, I think the standard metric for a pseudosphere (which is like the 2D version of a Schwarzschild metric) is something like ds² = (r²/(r² - r_s r)) (dx² + dy²), but wait, no, I'm mixing things up. Let me think again.

Wait, the metric for a 2D pseudosphere (which is a type of solution to the vacuum Einstein equations) is usually written as ds² = (r²/(r² - r_s^2)) (dx² + dy²), where r_s is the Schwarzschild radius. But in this case, the given metric has 32/(4 - x² - y²). Let me see, 4 is probably r², so r=2. So the denominator is (r² - x² - y²) = 4 - (x² + y²). 

Wait, but the numerator is 32. Hmm. So for the standard Schwarzschild-like metric in 2D, the coefficient would be r²/(r² - r_s). Wait, no, wait. Let me recall the form. In 2D, the metric for a point mass is often written as ds² = (r_s r)/(r - r_s) (dx² + dy²), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's something else. Wait, perhaps comparing the given metric to the standard form.

Wait, the standard Schwarzschild metric in 2D (which is a pseudosphere) has the form ds² = (r² - 2 M r)⁻¹ dr² + r² dθ², but that's in polar coordinates. Alternatively, in isotropic coordinates, perhaps it's written differently.

Alternatively, another approach: the area of a pseudosphere in 2D would be analogous to the area of a sphere in higher dimensions. But wait, the area might be tricky because the pseudosphere has a singularity. Let's think about the metric. The denominator is 4 - x² - y². So when x² + y² approaches 4, the metric blows up, meaning that's the event horizon or the singularity.

But the question is about the area of the pseudosphere. Wait, in 2D, the pseudosphere is a 1-dimensional surface? Or maybe it's a 2D surface embedded in some higher dimensions. Wait, no, the metric given is 2-dimensional. So the pseudosphere here is a 2D surface.

Wait, the area in 2D would be an integral over the surface. But wait, when the denominator approaches zero, the metric becomes singular. So maybe the total area is infinite, but I'm not sure.

Let me think about calculating the area. The area A is the integral over the region where the metric is defined of the square root of the determinant of the metric tensor. Since it's a 2D metric, the determinant is (32/(4 - x² - y²))^2 times the determinant of the (dx² + dy²) part, but the determinant of that is 1. So the area element dA is sqrt(det g) dx dy. So sqrt(det g) is 32/(4 - x² - y²).

Wait, no, wait: the metric tensor g in 2D is diagonal, with g_xx = 32/(4 - x² - y²), g_yy = same. So the determinant det g is (32^2)/(4 - x² - y²)^2. The square root of that would be 32/(4 - x² - y²). So dA = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] dx dy.

But to find the total area, I need to integrate this over all x and y where the metric is defined. The domain is where the denominator is positive, because otherwise the metric would be imaginary, which doesn't make sense. So 4 - x² - y² > 0 → x² + y² < 4. So the domain is the disk of radius 2.

So the area is the integral over x² + y² < 4 of [32/(4 - r²)] r dr dθ, where r is the radial coordinate and θ is the angle. Switching to polar coordinates makes sense here.

So substituting x² + y² = r², dx dy = r dr dθ.

So the integral becomes:

A = ∫ (θ from 0 to 2π) ∫ (r from 0 to 2) [32/(4 - r²)] * r dr dθ.

Factor out the constants:

A = 32 * ∫ (0 to 2π) dθ ∫ (0 to 2) [r/(4 - r²)] dr.

Compute the integrals step by step.

First, the θ integral: ∫0 to 2π dθ = 2π.

So A = 32 * 2π * ∫0 to 2 [r/(4 - r²)] dr.

Now compute the radial integral ∫ [r/(4 - r²)] dr.

Let me make a substitution: let u = 4 - r² → du = -2r dr → (-1/2) du = r dr.

So the integral becomes:

∫ [r/(4 - r²)] dr = ∫ (1/u) * (-1/2) du = (-1/2) ∫ (1/u) du = (-1/2) ln |u| + C.

Now evaluate from r=0 to r=2.

At r=2: u=4 - (2)^2=0. So ln(0) is negative infinity. Wait, but wait, when r approaches 2 from below, u approaches 0 from above. So ln(u) approaches negative infinity.

So the integral from 0 to 2 is [ (-1/2) (ln(0) - ln(4)) ) ].

But ln(0) is negative infinity, so the integral diverges. That means the area is infinite. So the area is infinity.

Looking at the options, option D is +infty.

Wait, but why? Because the metric has a singularity at r=2 (the horizon), and the area integral becomes divergent. So the total area is infinite.

Alternatively, maybe the pseudosphere has finite area. But according to the integral, it's infinite.

Wait, but sometimes in such cases, the area might be considered up to the horizon, but in this case, the area is still infinite because the integral diverges as you approach r=2.

So the answer should be D) +infty.

The given metric is:

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left(dx^2 + dy^2\right),
\]

and the task is to find the area of the pseudosphere with radius \( r = 2 \). The metric is defined for \( 4 - x^2 - y^2 > 0 \), which corresponds to the region \( x^2 + y^2 < 4 \), or \( r < 2 \), where \( r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \). The area of the pseudosphere can be computed by integrating the area element \( dA \) over this region.

The area element \( dA \) is derived from the determinant of the metric tensor. For the given metric, the determinant of \( g \) is:

\[
\det(g) = \left(\frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2}\right)^2.
\]

Thus, the area element is:

\[
dA = \sqrt{\det(g)} \, dx \, dy = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \, dx \, dy.
\]

Switching to polar coordinates (\( x^2 + y^2 = r^2 \), \( dx \, dy = r \, dr \, d\theta \)), the area integral becomes:

\[
A = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^2 \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \cdot r \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

Factoring out constants:

\[
A = 32 \cdot \int_0^{2\pi} d\theta \cdot \int_0^2 \frac{r}{4 - r^2} \, dr.
\]

The angular integral evaluates to:

\[
\int_0^{2\pi} d\theta = 2\pi.
\]

The radial integral is computed using the substitution \( u = 4 - r^2 \), \( du = -2r \, dr \), which gives:

\[
\int_0^2 \frac{r}{4 - r^2} \, dr = -\frac{1}{2} \int_{u=4}^{u=0} \frac{1}{u} \, du = -\frac{1}{2} \ln|u| \Big|_{4}^{0}.
\]

As \( u \to 0 \), \( \ln|u| \to -\infty \), causing the integral to diverge. This indicates that the total area is infinite. Therefore, the area of the pseudosphere is:

\[
A = +\infty.
\]

From the options provided, the correct answer is:
