Okay, so I've got this complicated question about molecular biology and genetics. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

The question is about a ligand-receptor pair expressed in neural crest cells. They're trying to understand their developmental fate by using a bicistronic vector. I remember that bicistronic vectors have two coding regions in one construct, usually under different promoters or regulatory elements. 

The construct they made has the ligand's ORF (open reading frame) at the 5' end, fused to mCherry. Then the receptor's ORF is at the 3' end with eGFP at the C-terminus. So the ligand is first, then the receptor. 

Wait, the ligand is under the CBA promoter. CBA is a strong promoter, I think it's constitutive, meaning it's always active. The receptor is after an IRES element. IRES stands for Internal Ribosome Entry Site. IRES allows for the translation of the second gene without the need for a second promoter. So the ligand is under CBA, which is a strong promoter, and the receptor is under the control of the IRES, which is part of the ligand's mRNA. 

But wait, the setup also includes stop cassettes. There's a loxP-stop-loxP cassette between the ligand ORF and mCherry. And for the receptor, there's a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette. I'm a bit confused about how these work. Oh right, the stop cassette with loxP sites is used for conditional expression. When Cre is present, it recombines and removes the stop cassette, allowing the downstream gene to be expressed. So, the ligand is fused to mCherry, but there's a stop in between. So without Cre, the ligand can't be expressed with mCherry? Or wait, maybe the ligand is under the CBA promoter, so it's always expressed, but the mCherry is only when the stop is removed. Hmm, maybe I need to think about the vector design more carefully. 

In the vector, the ligand's ORF is at 5', then the stop cassette, then mCherry. So the ligand is under CBA, which is a strong promoter. So when transcribed, the mRNA will have the ligand ORF, then the stop cassette, then mCherry. But without Cre, the stop cassette would prevent mCherry from being expressed. Similarly, the receptor is at 3', with a stop cassette before eGFP. So the receptor is under the IRES, which is part of the ligand's mRNA. So when the ligand is translated, the ribosome might drop off and then the IRES allows the receptor to be translated. But again, without Cre, there's a stop cassette between the receptor and eGFP.

Wait, so when you use Cre, which Cre is it? The vector uses loxP and lox2272. LoxP is a standard site, and lox2272 is a variant. Cre from the SOX10-Cre mice would specifically target which lox sites? SOX10-Cre is a transgenic mouse where the Cre gene is under the control of the SOX10 promoter, which is active in neural crest cells. So when they breed the homozygous mice with SOX10-Cre, the Cre should be expressed in neural crest-derived cells. 

In the construct, the ligand has a loxP-stop-loxP cassette between itself and mCherry, and the receptor has a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette. So when Cre is introduced, it will recombine the loxP sites and the lox2272 sites. But wait, I think Cre can only cut loxP sites, not lox2272. Oh, right, lox2272 is a variant that is not recognized by Cre. So maybe in the construct, the ligand and mCherry are separated by loxP, and the receptor and eGFP are separated by lox2272. Therefore, Cre would only recombine the loxP cassette, but not the lox2272. 

Wait, or maybe the vector is set up so that each stop cassette is in a different lox site. So, for the ligand and mCherry, the stop is between them with loxP. For the receptor and eGFP, the stop is between them with lox2272. Cre can only cut loxP, so when Cre is present, the loxP stop cassette is removed, allowing mCherry to be expressed after the ligand. But the lox2272 stop cassette for the receptor and eGFP would not be cut by Cre, so the stop remains, meaning the receptor is expressed, but eGFP is not.

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Because then when you use Cre, the ligand would be expressed, and the mCherry would be expressed as well, because the stop is removed. But the receptor would have its own stop cassette (lox2272), so the eGFP wouldn't be expressed. Hmm, but the question is about why there's no green signal. Green is from eGFP, so the eGFP isn't expressed.

Wait, but maybe I got the vector setup wrong. Let me think again. The ligand ORF is 5' end, followed by a stop cassette (loxP-stop-loxP), then mCherry. The receptor ORF is 3' end, with a stop cassette (lox2272) before eGFP. So in the absence of Cre, the ligand is expressed, but mCherry is not (because the stop cassette prevents it), and the receptor is under the IRES, so it's expressed, but eGFP isn't (stop cassette). 

When you have Cre, which is introduced by the SOX10-Cre mice, the Cre would recombine the loxP sites. So the ligand's stop cassette would be removed, allowing mCherry to be expressed. But the receptor's stop cassette is in lox2272, which Cre can't cut, so the stop remains, so eGFP isn't expressed. So the mouse would express the ligand and mCherry, but not the receptor and eGFP. 

But wait, the question says that after crossing the mouse to SOX10-Cre, they don't see a green signal. So eGFP isn't expressed. That suggests the receptor-eGFP construct isn't being expressed. But why? Because the stop remains.

Wait, but wait again. The IRES is after the ligand ORF. So the receptor is expressed as a separate ORF via the IRES. So without Cre, the ligand is expressed (under CBA promoter), but the stop between ligand and mCherry (loxP) blocks mCherry expression. The receptor is expressed via IRES, but the stop between receptor and eGFP (lox2272) blocks eGFP expression. 

With Cre, ligand and mCherry are expressed (since the loxP stop is removed), but receptor and eGFP would still be blocked because the stop cassette is lox2272, which Cre can't cut. So in the mouse model, when they use SOX10-Cre, the Cre should be active in neural crest cells, leading to the removal of the loxP stop in the ligand, so mCherry should be expressed. But eGFP (from the receptor) wouldn't be expressed because the lox2272 stop isn't cut by Cre.

So when they look for eGFP, they don't see it. So the question is why. The options are:

A) ligand and receptor are paracrine. Paracrine means they act on nearby cells. But that doesn't explain why eGFP isn't expressed.

B) the receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi. If it's stuck, maybe it's not trafficking correctly. But how would the vector setup cause that?

C) enhancer for ligand and receptor is missing. The vector uses CBA and IRES. The CBA promoter is strong. The IRES should allow the receptor's expression. So if the enhancer is missing, maybe they aren't expressed at all. But the mouse is homozygous for the construct, which presumably has the necessary elements. Unless the construct is missing the enhancer for proper expression, but that's more about whether the genes are expressed at all, not why eGFP isn't showing.

D) receptor and eGFP are not in frame. If the stop cassette isn't removed, and the eGFP is in frame, then the stop would prevent expression. Wait, if the stop is present, the receptor would be expressed but eGFP wouldn't. But if the stop is not in frame, perhaps the reading frame would allow the receptor to be expressed but eGFP not. Or, if the fusion is not in frame, the eGFP would not be correctly expressed.

Wait, the setup is that the receptor ORF is at 3' and fused to eGFP at the C-terminus. So the construct would be Receptor-eGFP. If the stop cassette isn't removed, the receptor would be expressed, but eGFP wouldn't. But in the case where the stop cassette is lox2272, which Cre can't cut, the stop remains. So the eGFP isn't expressed, which is why they don't see the green signal.

But the question is why. The possible reasons given in the options.

Option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. That would mean that the eGFP isn't correctly expressed because the reading frame is wrong. But if the stop is present, perhaps the eGFP isn't even initiated. If the stop is present, the receptor's ORF is terminated, so the eGFP isn't expressed. So the stop is in between.

Wait, another thought: the loxP and lox2272 cassettes are stop signals. So when the stop is present, the ORF is interrupted, so neither the downstream gene (mCherry or eGFP) is expressed. So in this case, the eGFP isn't expressed because the stop cassette isn't removed. So why isn't the stop removed?

Because the Cre used is SOX10-Cre, which is only active in neural crest-derived cells, perhaps? Or perhaps the vector was designed so that only certain parts are Cre-regulated.

Wait, the vector is a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. The ligand is under CBA (constitutive), and the receptor is under IRES, which is translationally driven by the ligand's mRNA. The stop cassettes are loxP for ligand and mCherry, and lox2272 for receptor and eGFP.

So the Cre would remove the loxP stop, allowing mCherry to be expressed alongside the ligand. But the lox2272 stop isn't affected by Cre, so the receptor is expressed but the eGFP isn't. 

But then, in the mice, when you cross them to SOX10-Cre, Cre is expressed in neural crest cells. So in those cells, the ligand and mCherry are expressed, but the receptor and eGFP are not.

So in the experiment, after the offspring are born, they visualize them under confocal. They're looking for eGFP, which should be expressed if the receptor is being expressed. But they don't see it. So why?

Looking at the options:

A) Ligand and receptor are paracrine. That would mean they act on nearby cells, which doesn't directly explain the lack of eGFP expression.

B) Receptor-eGFP stuck in Golgi. If the protein isn't trafficking, it might not fluoresce, but the question is about expression in the first place.

C) Missing enhancer. If the enhancer is missing, the genes aren't expressed. But the vector has the CBA promoter for ligand and IRES for receptor; perhaps that's sufficient.

D) Not in frame. If the stop is in the same reading frame, the receptor ORF would terminate early, so eGFP isn't expressed. But the stop is in a different frame? Wait, if the stop is in a loxP cassette, which is a stop signal, but is it in frame?

Alternatively, perhaps the vector wasn't correctly designed. For example, the eGFP is in a different frame, so when the stop is not removed, the receptor is read in one frame and eGFP in another, leading to a frameshift. But I'm not exactly sure.

Wait, the question is about why the eGFP isn't expressed. The problem is that the mouse model is crossed with SOX10-Cre, which should induce Cre in neural crest cells, leading to removal of the loxP stop for the ligand. But the lox2272 stop isn't affected, so the receptor's eGFP remains under stop.

Wait, but why doesn't Cre remove the lox2272 stop? Because Cre can't cut lox2272. So the eGFP stop remains, so eGFP isn't expressed.

But in that case, the construct design dictates that eGFP expression is dependent on a different Cre site. So why is eGFP not expressed? Because the stop cassette is in place, which is because the lox2272 isn't cut by SOX10-Cre.

So the answer would be that the stop for eGFP is still present because Cre didn't remove it. But the options don't state that.

Looking again at the options:

Option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. That would mean that the eGFP isn't correctly attached to the receptor. But maybe the stop cassette is not in frame, so the ORF isn't properly terminated, leading to eGFP not being expressed.

Alternatively, perhaps the eGFP is in a different frame, so even if the stop is removed, it's not translated correctly. But in the construct, the stop cassette is between receptor and eGFP. So without the stop, the receptor and eGFP would be in the same frame, so they would be expressed as a fusion protein. But if the stop isn't removed, the receptor is expressed, but the eGFP isn't.

Wait, but the mouse model is homozygous for the construct in a wt background. So when the Cre is introduced, only the loxP stops are removed, not the lox2272. So the eGFP remains under stop. Therefore, the receptor is expressed, but eGFP isn't. So in the Western blot, perhaps the receptor is expressed, but eGFP isn't. 

But the question is about the fluorescence. They didn't see green, which is eGFP. So why isn't eGFP expressed? Because the stop cassette is still in place. 

Looking at the options, which one matches this scenario?

Option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. If the stop is present, the eGFP isn't even initiated. So frame wouldn't matter. So that would not explain the lack of eGFP. 

Option C says the enhancer is missing. If the enhancer is missing, the receptor wouldn't be expressed. But the construct has an IRES, which should allow for translation of the receptor. So that's probably not the issue.

Option B: the receptor is stuck in the Golgi. That would affect trafficking but not expression. The eGFP wouldn't be on the surface, but the Western blot would still show the protein. The question says they tested expression on Western blot after transfection; total proteins proportional to actin. So if the eGFP wasn't expressed, they wouldn't see it on Western. But in the question, the mouse was crossbred and visualized live, so perhaps the Western was before that.

Wait, the question says that after plasmid transfection to primary astrocyte culture, they ran a Western blot and saw signals proportional to actin. That just means their loading controls are correct. They used antibodies against the overexpressed proteins. So if the construct was expressed, they would see bands. But in the mouse experiment, the eGFP isn't expressed, which would be due to the stop cassette not being removed.

But according to the setup, the eGFP's stop is in lox2272, which Cre can't cut. So the stop remains. So the receptor is expressed, but eGFP isn't. Therefore, in the mouse, you'd see the receptor (if the antibody is against the receptor) but not eGFP.

But the question is why they don't see green (eGFP). The answer likely relates to the construct design. So the correct answer might be D, but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, another angle: the loxP and lox2272 are different. Cre can only cut loxP. So in the construct, the ligand has a loxP stop which is removed by Cre, allowing mCherry to be expressed. The receptor has a lox2272 stop. Since Cre doesn't cut lox2272, the stop remains, so eGFP isn't expressed. So the reason they don't see eGFP is because the stop isn't removed, not because of frame issues.

But the options don't directly address that. The options are about why eGFP isn't expressed.

Looking at the options again:

A) Paracrine relationship: doesn't explain expression.

B) Receptor stuck in Golgi: affects localization, not expression.

C) Enhancer missing: affects expression.

D) Receptor and eGFP not in frame.

Wait, maybe the stop is in the same reading frame as the receptor ORF. So when the stop is present, the receptor's ORF is terminated, and eGFP isn't expressed. So the receptor itself isn't expressed because the stop is in frame. But that would mean the receptor isn't expressed either. But in the mouse, SOX10-Cre should allow the ligand to be expressed, and the receptor is under IRES. Since IRES is after the ligand ORF, perhaps in the presence of Cre, the ligand is expressed, but the stop in the receptor's ORF (lox2272) isn't removed, so the receptor isn't expressed. Wait, but the IRES is in the ligand's mRNA, so perhaps the receptor is expressed regardless of the stop cassette.

Wait, perhaps the stop cassette between receptor and eGFP doesn't affect the receptor's expression. Because the stop is after the receptor ORF. So the receptor is expressed, but eGFP isn't. So the Western would show the receptor, and the confocal would show eGFP only if the eGFP is expressed.

But in the mouse, the Cre removes the loxP stop, so the ligand and mCherry are expressed. The receptor under IRES is expressed, but eGFP isn't. So in the confocal, they look for eGFP, which isn't present.

So the reason is that the stop cassette for eGFP isn't removed because Cre can't act on lox2272. But the options don't directly address that.

Looking at the options again, option D says that the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. If the stop is in frame, the receptor's ORF is terminated early, preventing eGFP expression. But the receptor itself might not be expressed correctly.

If the stop is in a different frame, maybe the receptor is expressed but eGFP isn't. So perhaps the stop cassette is in a way that the receptor is read in one frame, and the eGFP in another, leading to a frameshift.

Alternatively, perhaps the eGFP is not in frame with the receptor, so even if the stop is removed, the eGFP isn't correctly expressed. But in this case, the stop is not removed, so eGFP isn't expressed either way.

Alternatively, perhaps the way the vector is constructed, the eGFP is not properly in frame with the receptor, so even if the stop were removed, the eGFP wouldn't be expressed correctly. But that's a design flaw, but I'm not sure if that's the case.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the stop cassette is not in the same reading frame as the receptor, so when it's present, the receptor is read through, and then the eGFP is out of frame. But if the stop is present, the receptor's ORF would be terminated, so the eGFP isn't expressed. I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps the IRES isn't working correctly, so the receptor isn't being expressed. But the IRES is a part of the ligand's mRNA, which is being translated, so the IRES should drive the receptor's translation.

Another angle: in the mouse model, after crossing with SOX10-Cre, the Cre is active in neural crest cells. So in those cells, the loxP stop is removed, allowing mCherry to be expressed. But the lox2272 stop isn't affected, so the eGFP isn't expressed. So the green signal (eGFP) isn't present because it's still under the lox2272 stop, which Cre can't remove.

So maybe the reason is that the construct wasn't designed to allow eGFP expression upon Cre activation. Only the mCherry is expressed, but not the eGFP. So the answer might be that the eGFP is not removed because the stop is in a different lox site.

But the question is why they don't see the eGFP. So perhaps the correct answer is option D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. Or perhaps it's option C: the enhancer is missing, but that seems less likely if the vector has CBA and IRES.

Wait, another thought: the lox2272 stop cassette is in the same frame as the receptor, so when the stop is present, the receptor's ORF is terminated, preventing its expression. But wait, the IRES would allow the receptor's expression regardless of the stop downstream.

Alternatively, perhaps the stop cassette between the receptor and eGFP is in a way that the receptor is in a different frame, leading to a frameshift. So the receptor isn't expressed, and neither is eGFP.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the possible answer choices again. The options are:

A) Paracrine relationship.

B) Receptor stuck in Golgi.

C) Missing enhancer.

D) Not in frame.

The correct answer is likely D, because if the stop cassette is in frame, the receptor's ORF is terminated early, so the receptor isn't expressed. But since the IRES is present, perhaps the receptor is expressed through the IRES. Alternatively, maybe the eGFP is in a different frame, so it's not expressed. 

Alternatively, the stop cassette is in the same frame, so the receptor isn't expressed. But in that case, the IRES would still drive the receptor's expression, unless the stop is in the same ORF.

Wait, the stop is after the receptor's ORF. So the receptor's coding sequence would be followed by a stop, which would terminate the receptor's expression. So the receptor wouldn't be expressed, and eGFP wouldn't either. But the IRES is supposed to drive the receptor's expression. 

Wait, no. The stop is between the receptor and eGFP. The IRES is part of the mRNA, allowing the receptor to be translated. So perhaps the stop doesn't affect the receptor's expression. Only the eGFP.

So the problem is that the eGFP can't be expressed because the stop isn't removed. So why isn't the stop removed? Because the stop is in a lox2272 site, which Cre can't cut. So the stop remains, hence eGFP isn't expressed.

But none of the options directly state that. The options are more about the construct's design leading to no expression.

So perhaps the correct answer is D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. If the stop is in the same frame as the receptor, then the receptor's ORF is terminated, so it isn't expressed. But the IRES is supposed to allow for the receptor's expression regardless. 

Alternatively, perhaps the vector design causes the eGFP not to be in frame, hence not expressed. But without the stop, it should be in frame.

I think I'm getting stuck here. Another approach: the vector uses two different lox sites. The ligand's stop is loxP, which Cre can cut, allowing mCherry to be expressed. The receptor's stop is lox2272, which Cre can't cut, so eGFP isn't expressed. So when the mouse is crossed with SOX10-Cre, only the ligand and mCherry are expressed in neural crest cells, but the receptor and eGFP are not. 

So the reason for no green signal is that the eGFP isn't being expressed because the stop isn't cut by Cre. But that's not one of the options. So perhaps the answer is C: the enhancer for the ligand and receptor is missing, but that's not correct because the vector has the necessary promoters.

Alternatively, perhaps the vector isn't correctly designed, leading to eGFP not being expressed. Maybe the IRES isn't working, but that's not one of the options.

Wait, the question says that the vector is a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. So the ligand and receptor are under different regulatory elements. So ligand is under CBA, and receptor under IRES. 

So, in the absence of Cre, the ligand is expressed (CBA), but mCherry isn't (loxP stop). The receptor is expressed via IRES, but eGFP isn't (lox2272 stop). 

When Cre is present, ligand and mCherry are expressed, but receptor and eGFP are not, because the lox2272 stop isn't cut. So the mouse would express the ligand and mCherry, but not the receptor and eGFP.

In the experiment, they look for eGFP in the offspring but don't see it. So that's because eGFP isn't expressed. The reason is that the stop cassette for eGFP isn't cut by Cre. But the question is why.

Looking at the options again, the correct answer must be one of them. Since the stop isn't removed, the eGFP isn't expressed. But the options don't directly address this, so I have to think about which option matches.

Option D: Receptor and eGFP are not in frame. If they are not in frame, then the eGFP isn't expressed. But in the construct, they should be in frame to allow a fusion protein. If the stop is present, the eGFP isn't even initiated. So the frame issue might not be the main problem.

Alternatively, perhaps the construct was designed such that only the ligand and mCherry are under Cre control, and the receptor and eGFP are under another system. But that's not indicated.

Wait, another possibility: the IRES is after the ligand's ORF, which is under CBA. The IRES allows the receptor's expression regardless of Cre. So even without Cre, the receptor is expressed. But in the presence of Cre, the ligand is expressed, mCherry is expressed, but the receptor and eGFP are already expressed, but eGFP isn't because the stop remains.

So the eGFP isn't expressed because the stop isn't removed. But the options don't state that.

Looking for the most plausible answer, I think the answer is D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. Because if the stop is in the same frame, the receptor would be truncated, but in this case, the stop is after the receptor, so it shouldn't affect the receptor's expression. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the vector's design leads to eGFP being out of frame, making it non-functional. But I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps the stop cassette is right after the receptor. So the receptor is in a certain frame, and eGFP is in another. If the stop is present, the receptor's ORF is terminated early, and eGFP isn't expressed. But if the stop is not in frame, then the receptor continues, and eGFP is in a different frame, leading to a frameshift. But in this case, the stop is present, so eGFP isn't expressed.

But the problem is that the stop isn't removed because it's in a different lox site. So the reason is that the lox2272 stop isn't cut by Cre, so it remains. But that's not an option.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is B: the receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi. But why would that happen? 

Alternatively, perhaps the frame is incorrect. So when the stop is present, the receptor is in one frame, eGFP in another. But without the stop, they are in the same frame. So in the presence of Cre, the stop is removed, and eGFP is expressed. But if the stop isn't removed, perhaps eGFP isn't expressed. But that doesn't explain why they don't see it.

At this point, perhaps the correct answer is D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. So even if the stop is removed, eGFP isn't expressed because the ORF is out of frame. But in this case, the stop wasn't removed because of the lox2272, so eGFP isn't expressed either way.

Wait, no. If the stop is removed, the eGFP should be in frame. But in this case, the stop isn't removed, so eGFP isn't expressed.

I think I'm overcomplicating this. The correct reasoning is that the eGFP isn't expressed because the stop cassette (lox2272) isn't removed by Cre, which can't cut that site. Therefore, the eGFP isn't expressed, so no green signal.

But none of the options state this. So perhaps the intended answer is D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. Because if the stop is in the same frame, the receptor is not expressed, and eGFP isn't either. But the IRES should allow the receptor to be expressed regardless.

Alternatively, perhaps the vector was designed so that the eGFP is expressed only when the stop is removed, but the stop isn't in the same frame as the receptor. So even if the stop is present, the receptor is expressed, but eGFP isn't.

But I'm not entirely sure. Given the options, I think the intended answer is D. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is C: the enhancer is missing, but I don't think that's the case since the vector has CBA and IRES.

Another thought: the ligand is expressed under CBA, which is a strong promoter. The receptor is under IRES, which is part of the ligand's mRNA. So the presence of Cre removes the stop for the ligand, allowing mCherry to be expressed. But the IRES allows the receptor to be expressed regardless, as it's part of the same mRNA. But the stop for eGFP remains, so it isn't expressed.

So the reason is that the eGFP's stop isn't removed, not because of frame issues. But since the options don't directly address this, perhaps the intended answer is D.

Wait, I'm going to go with the frame issue. If the stop is in frame, then the receptor's ORF is terminated early, and eGFP isn't expressed. But the IRES would allow the receptor to be expressed. Therefore, in this design, the eGFP wouldn't be expressed because the stop is in frame. So the correct answer is D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves a bicistronic lox-Cre vector designed to express a ligand and receptor pair in neural crest cells. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, and the receptor is under the control of an IRES element. The construct includes stop cassettes: a loxP-stop-loxP cassette between the ligand and mCherry, and a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette between the receptor and eGFP. SOX10-Cre mice are used to activate Cre in neural crest cells, which should remove the loxP stop cassette, allowing mCherry to be expressed. However, the lox2272 stop cassette cannot be removed by Cre, leaving the eGFP under a stop signal.

### Key Analysis of the Options:
1. **Option A: Ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship**  
   This option suggests that the ligand and receptor act on nearby cells. However, this does not explain why eGFP is not expressed, as the question focuses on expression issues in the construct, not signaling dynamics. This option is incorrect.

2. **Option B: The receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi**  
   If the receptor-eGFP construct were stuck in the Golgi, it would affect trafficking rather than expression. The Western blot after transfection showed proportional actin loading, indicating that expression was tested at the protein level. Since the eGFP is not expressed at all, this option is unlikely to explain the lack of fluorescence.

3. **Option C: The enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing**  
   The construct uses the CBA promoter for the ligand and an IRES for the receptor, both of which should provide sufficient expression without requiring additional enhancers. This option does not align with the construct design and is unlikely to be correct.

4. **Option D: The receptor and eGFP are not in frame**  
   If the receptor and eGFP are not in frame, the eGFP would not be expressed correctly. The stop cassette between the receptor and eGFP (lox2272) cannot be removed by Cre, leaving the eGFP under a stop signal. This would prevent eGFP expression entirely, consistent with the observed lack of fluorescence. This option aligns with the construct design and the experimental results.

### Conclusion:
The most likely reason for the lack of eGFP expression is that the receptor and eGFP are not in frame, preventing proper expression of eGFP. This is consistent with the construct design and the experimental observations.

**Answer: D**
