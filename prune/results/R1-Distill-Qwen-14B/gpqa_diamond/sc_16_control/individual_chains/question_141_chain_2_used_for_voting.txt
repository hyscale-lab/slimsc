Okay, I need to figure out this organic chemistry problem. Let's see what the question is about. The question says that 1-bromobenzene-2-d is treated with NaNH2 in condensed ammonia. I'm supposed to find out how many possible organic products there are.

Wait, wait, wait. Wait, 1-bromobenzene-2-d? Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Oh, wait, maybe it's 1-bromo-2-dimethylaminobenzene? Or perhaps it's 1-bromo-2-dimethylaminobenzene, but the "d" might be a typo. Alternatively, perhaps it's 2-dimethylamino-1-bromobenzene. I'm not exactly sure, but I think it's a bromobenzene derivative with a substituent at position 2. Maybe the substituent is something that can act as a directing group.

Wait, the structure: if it's 1-bromo-2-dimethylaminobenzene, then the substituents are at positions 1 (bromo) and 2 (dimethylamino). So the benzene ring has Br at position 1 and dimethylamino group at position 2.

Now, when treated with NaNH2 in condensed ammonia solvent. I remember that NaNH2 is a strong base, often used in deprotonation reactions. In aromatic chemistry, it's used for elimination or perhaps for the formation of benzynes.

Wait, but another possibility is that this is a Friedel-Crafts alkyne synthesis, but I think that typically uses AlCl3 as a catalyst.

Wait, no, with NaNH2 in ammonia, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation? Or maybe a coupling reaction.

Wait, another thought: when a bromobenzene derivative is treated with a strong base like NaNH2, especially in a condensed ammonia solvent, it's likely to undergo elimination to form a benzyne intermediate. Benzyne is a triple bond in the benzene ring, which can then undergo various reactions like cycloaddition or trapping with other nucleophiles.

So, the bromobenzene would lose HBr via elimination to form benzyne. But in this case, the benzene ring has substituents. The substituents are Br at position 1 and dimethylamino at position 2. So, when elimination happens, two adjacent positions would lose HBr to form a triple bond, so the triple bond would be between carbon 1 and 2.

Wait, but wait, the structure is 1-bromo-2-dimethylaminobenzene. So, the Br is at position 1, and the dimethylamino group (which is a strong activating, ortho/para-directing group) is at position 2.

If we eliminate H from position 2 and Br from position 1, that would form a triple bond between 1 and 2. But wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me visualize the benzene ring: position 1 is Br, position 2 is dimethylamino. So, the substituents are adjacent to each other. So, the two substituents are on adjacent carbons.

Wait, but when eliminating HBr, we need adjacent H and Br. So, the Br is at position 1. The H must be on position 2 because that's adjacent, right? But position 2 already has a dimethylamino group. Wait, but that's a bulky substituent. So, is there a H on C2 available for elimination? The dimethylamino group is -N(CH3)2, which is a strong activating group, but it occupies two adjacent positions. So, the C2 has the dimethylamino group. Does that mean there's no H on C2? Or perhaps, wait, the structure is 1-bromo-2-dimethylaminobenzene. So, benzene ring: C1 is Br, C2 is -N(CH3)2.

So, to eliminate HBr, you need adjacent H and Br. But in this case, the Br is at C1, and the H would need to be on C2, but C2 is substituted with a dimethylamino group. Hmm, so maybe elimination is not possible between C1 and C2.

Wait, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong. Is the compound 1-bromo-2-dimethylaminobenzene, which is o-bromo-N,N-dimethylaminobenzene? So, the substituents are on adjacent carbons. But if that's the case, when trying to eliminate HBr, you can't because the H isn't available on the adjacent carbon. Because the adjacent carbon (C2) is substituted with a bulky group.

Wait, but if the H is on C1, then the Br is on C1. No, that can't happen because elimination is H from adjacent to Br.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the substituents are not adjacent. Wait, maybe I'm misreading the compound. 1-bromobenzene-2-d... Maybe it's 2-dimethylamino-1-bromobenzene, which would place the Br at position 1 and the dimethylamino at position 2, which are adjacent.

Wait, but then if the Br is at 1 and the dimethylamino at 2, then position 1 and 2 are adjacent. So when eliminating, you would lose H from position 2 (but that's where the amino group is; does that have a hydrogen attached? Or is the C2 already substituted so that there's no H available?

Wait, the structure is 1-bromo-2-dimethylaminobenzene. So, the benzene ring has a Br at position 1 and a dimethylamino group (which is -N(CH3)2) at position 2. So, the dimethylamino group is attached to C2. So, the substituent on C2 is a strong activating group, but in terms of elimination, the C2 is already substituted, so perhaps there's no H attached to C2.

But wait, benzene is a ring with six carbons. Each carbon is bonded to another, and each has one H if unsubstituted. When substituted, the H is replaced. So, in 1-bromo-2-dimethylaminobenzene, C1 has Br, C2 has -N(CH3)2, which is a large substituent.

So, when trying to eliminate HBr, the H must be on a carbon adjacent to Br. So, the Br is on C1. The adjacent carbons are C6 and C2. C6 is next to C1. So, the H on C6 would be adjacent to C1. But wait, in a benzene ring, each carbon is connected to two others. So, positions 1 and 2 are adjacent, but positions 1 and 6 are also adjacent.

Wait, in the numbering, position 1 is Br, position 2 is dimethylamino. So, position 6 is adjacent to position 1. But position 6 is another carbon in the ring. So, the H on C6 is adjacent to the Br on C1.

So, perhaps the reaction can proceed by eliminating H from C6 and Br from C1, forming a triple bond between C1 and C6. Or wait, no, elimination would form a triple bond between C1 and C2, but in this case, C2 is substituted, so maybe that's not possible. Alternatively, since C1 is Br and C6 is H, perhaps elimination can occur between C1 and C6, forming a triple bond between those positions.

Wait, but when you eliminate HBr, you remove H from a carbon adjacent to Br, leading to the formation of a triple bond between the two carbons. So, in this case, if the H is on C6 (which is adjacent to C1), then elimination would form a triple bond between C1 and C6, leading to a benzynes structure.

But wait, the benzene ring would lose HBr and form a triple bond between C1 and C6, which are positions 1 and 6. So, the triple bond would be between 1 and 6, making the benzyne.

But benzyne is a very reactive species. It can undergo various reactions, but in this case, the question is about the products formed when the benzyne is generated. Alternatively, perhaps the benzyne can undergo some kind of trapping reaction if any nucleophiles are present.

Wait, but the reaction is treatment with NaNH2 in condensed ammonia. So, what's the role of ammonia? Well, ammonia is a nucleophile. So, when the benzyne is formed, it can react with ammonia, perhaps.

Wait, let me think about the formation of benzyne. The starting material is 1-bromo-2-dimethylaminobenzene. When treated with a strong base like NaNH2, the H adjacent to Br (on C6) is abstracted, leading to the formation of a benzynes intermediate.

Now, the structure would be a triple bond between C1 and C6, and we have substituents at C2 (dimethylamino) and at C1 (no, C1 is where the Br was, which is eliminated as Br-). Wait, no, the Br is removed, so C1 becomes part of the triple bond.

Wait, perhaps the benzyne structure would have triple bond between C1 and C2, but that's where the dimethylamino group is. Hmm, no, because the dimethylamino is on C2, which is adjacent to C1 (Br) but not to C6. Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond forms between C1 and C6.

Wait, but the substituents are on C1 (Br) and C2 (dimethylamino). So, elimination would occur between C1 and C6, making the triple bond between 1 and 6, since those are adjacent. So, the triple bond is between carbons 1 and 6.

Wait, but then the dimethylamino group is at position 2, which is adjacent to position 1. So, the triple bond is between 1 and 6, and the substituent at 2 is dimethylamino.

So, the benzyne would have a triple bond, and the dimethylamino group is on C2, which is adjacent to one end of the triple bond.

Now, when benzyne is formed, it can react with nucleophiles. In this case, since we're in ammonia, perhaps the ammonia acts as a nucleophile.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a coupling reaction, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another idea: when NaNH2 is used in ammonia, it's often involved in elimination reactions to form benzynes, which can then dimerize or react with other nucleophiles. But in this case, perhaps the benzyne is generated, and then it can undergo substitution if there's a nucleophile present.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is dehydrohalogenation to form benzyne, which then can undergo various reactions, but in this case, if the solvent is ammonia, maybe the benzyne can react with ammonia.

Wait, perhaps the benzyne can undergo a [2+2] cycloaddition with another benzyne molecule, but that would produce a dimer. But I'm not sure if that's the case here.

Wait, perhaps more likely, the benzyne can react with ammonia to form an azine or some other product. Or perhaps, the benzyne is trapped by the ammonia.

Wait, but in the presence of a strong base, perhaps it's more about elimination than substitution.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is not elimination but a nucleophilic aromatic substitution. Wait, but for nucleophilic aromatic substitution, the ring needs to be activated towards electrophilic substitution, but I'm getting a bit mixed up.

Wait, the substituent at position 2 is dimethylamino, which is a strong activating group (ortho/para director). But it's a strong electron-donating group. For nucleophilic substitution on aromatic rings, typically, you need a strongly deactivating group, like nitro, to make the ring electron-deficient.

So, perhaps the dimethylamino group is activating, making the ring more electron-rich, which is not favorable for nucleophilic substitution. So, maybe elimination is the main pathway.

So, the reaction likely leads to the formation of benzyne. Then, what happens to the benzyne?

In the presence of ammonia, perhaps the benzyne can react in a way that adds ammonia across the triple bond.

Wait, benzynes can react with nucleophiles. For example, in a Diels-Alder reaction, but that's with dienes. Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond can react with ammonia to form an azine. But I'm not exactly sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the benzyne can undergo a ring expansion or contraction, but I'm not remembering that.

Another approach: perhaps the reaction is dehydrohalogenation leading to the formation of a benzynes intermediate, which then can undergo various reactions. But how many products are formed?

Wait, the question is about the number of possible organic products. So, if the benzynes intermediate forms, and then reacts in different ways, how many different products would form?

Alternatively, perhaps the benzynes can form different products based on the attack of the nucleophile.

Wait, in the presence of ammonia, maybe the benzyne can react with ammonia to form an azine. Let's think: benzynes can react with amines to form azines, which are six-membered aromatic rings containing two nitrogen atoms. But I'm not exactly certain about the specifics.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is just the formation of the benzynes, with no further reaction, but that doesn't make sense because the question is about products, implying something beyond the starting material.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is treated with NaNH2 in ammonia, which leads to the formation of the benzynes, which can then dimerize or undergo some rearrangement.

Alternatively, perhaps the conditions are such that the benzynes can react with the dimethylamino group. Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: the benzynes intermediate can undergo various modes of attack. For instance, in a benzynes intermediate, the triple bond is between two positions, and the ring is highly strained. This can lead to different products depending on where the attack occurs.

Wait, but in this case, the benzynes would have the triple bond between 1 and 6, with a dimethylamino group at position 2. So, when the triple bond opens, the attack can happen at either end, but given the substituents, maybe certain positions are favored.

Alternatively, perhaps the benzynes can form in more than one way, leading to different products.

Wait, but wait, the starting material is 1-bromo-2-dimethylaminobenzene. When elimination occurs, the H must be abstracted from a position adjacent to Br. So, the positions adjacent to Br (C1) are C2 and C6. But C2 is already substituted with a dimethylamino group, which is bulky. So, perhaps the H is taken from C6, leading to the triple bond between C1 and C6.

But in that case, the triple bond would be between C1 and C6, making the benzynes structure. Then, the substituents are at C2 (dimethylamino) and the triple bond between C1 and C6.

Now, when this benzyne is formed, it can react with ammonia. How?

Benzyne is an antiaromatic species, so it's highly strained. It can react with nucleophiles such as NH3, but I'm not exactly certain about the mechanism.

Alternatively, perhaps the benzynes can undergo a ring-opening reaction. For example, in the presence of a nucleophile, the triple bond can open, with the nucleophile attacking at each end, leading to a product with two new substituents.

So, in the presence of NH3, the benzynes could react to form a diamine product. But given the starting structure, perhaps only certain positions are available.

Wait, let me think about the possible products. The benzynes would have substituents at C2 (dimethylamino) and the triple bond between C1 and C6.

When the triple bond opens, the ammonia could attack at either C1 or C6, but considering the substituents, perhaps the attack can happen at those positions. But the existing group at C2 (dimethylamino) might influence where the attack occurs.

Alternatively, perhaps the benzynes can form two different products based on where the attack occurs.

Wait, but the benzynes is symmetric in some way. If the triple bond is between 1 and 6, and the substituent is at 2, then attacking at C1 and C6 would lead to two different products because the substituent at C2 is adjacent to C1 but not to C6.

Wait, C1 is adjacent to C2 (since they're next to each other in the ring), but C6 is across from C2. So, if the triple bond is between C1 and C6, and the substituent is at C2, when the triple bond opens, the attack can occur at either end.

So, attack at C1 would lead to a structure where C1 has an amino group, and the ring would have substituents at C1 (NH2) and C2 (NMe2). But wait, the structure is benzene with substituents at C1 and C2. Alternatively, perhaps the attack can happen on either end, leading to different products.

Alternatively, perhaps the attack can happen at either end, but considering the substituent's influence, maybe only one product is formed predominantly.

Wait, but another possibility: the benzynes could also undergo other reactions, such as dimerization. For example, two benzynes molecules could couple to form a dimer, but I'm not sure if that's relevant here.

Alternatively, perhaps the benzynes is not a stable intermediate and instead undergoes a different reaction.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about the possible elimination products and reactions.

The starting material is 1-bromo-2-dimethylaminobenzene. When treated with NaNH2, a strong base, the H adjacent to Br is abstracted, leading to the formation of a benzynes intermediate (triple bond between C1 and C6).

Now, the benzynes can react in different ways. One possibility is that the benzynes can undergo a [2+2] cycloaddition with another benzynes molecule, but that's more common under UV light, leading to a dimer.

Alternatively, the benzynes can react with ammonia (NH3) as a nucleophile. The triple bond is highly strained, so it's reactive. The attack of NH3 could occur at either end of the triple bond.

But the positions available for attack are C1 and C6. However, the substituents at C2 (dimethylamino) might influence the attack. Let's think: when the triple bond is between C1 and C6, the substituent at C2 is adjacent to C1. So, if the attack occurs at C1, the resulting structure would have an NH2 group at C1, and the dimethylamino at C2. But wait, the dimethylamino is a bulky group; perhaps steric factors influence where the attack occurs.

Alternatively, perhaps the attack can happen at either C1 or C6, leading to two different products: one with the amino group at C1 and another at C6.

But wait, the starting material has the substituents at C1 and C2. If the attack occurs at C1, then the product would have the amino group at C1 and the dimethylamino at C2. If the attack occurs at C6, the product would have the amino group at C6 and the dimethylamino at C2.

But wait, the original substituent is C1 (Br) and C2 (dimethylamino). When the Br leaves, the C1 becomes part of the triple bond. So, the product after attack would have substituents at C1 and C2.

Wait, but the attack adds an amino group to one end. So, if the attack is at C1, the product would have an amino group at C1 and the dimethylamino at C2. Similarly, if the attack is at C6, then the amino group would be at C6, and the dimethylamino remains at C2. But wait, in that case, the substituents would be at C2 and C6.

But the ring is symmetric in some way? Or perhaps there's another possibility.

Wait, another approach: the benzynes can react with ammonia in a way that the ammonia adds across the triple bond, leading to a 1,2-diaminobenzene structure. But considering the substituents, that might not be the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed via benzynes and instead undergoes a different pathway, like a coupling reaction.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about the elimination step. When NaNH2 is used in ammonia, it's a strong base that deprotonates. The H must be adjacent to Br for elimination to form benzynes.

In the starting material, the Br is at C1, and the adjacent H is at C6 (since C2 is substituted with dimethylamino, which is a bulky group, perhaps making the H on C6 more accessible for deprotonation? Or maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the Br is at C1, and the H on C6 is more available for elimination.

So, elimination occurs between C1 and C6, forming a triple bond. Then, the benzynes can react with ammonia.

If the benzynes is formed, and then it reacts with ammonia, perhaps the triple bond opens to add an amino group.

For example, the triple bond could react with ammonia to form a 1,6-diaminobenzene structure. But wait, that would require two amine groups across the ring, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the benzynes can react in a way that only one amine is added, leading to a substitution product.

Wait, perhaps after elimination, the benzynes can undergo a [4π] electrocyclic ring closure, but that's more about the stability of the benzynes.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to the formation of an azobenzene derivative. But I'm not certain about that.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a coupling reaction, such as a Ullmann coupling, but that typically requires a copper catalyst and aryl halides.

Wait, perhaps another approach: the dimethylamino group is a strong activating group. So, when the benzynes is formed, perhaps the nucleophilic attack is directed by the substituents.

In the benzynes structure, the triple bond is between C1 and C6, and the substituent at C2 is a strong activating group, which could direct the attack to certain positions.

Wait, but in this case, the substituent is at C2, which is adjacent to C1. So, perhaps the attack would occur at C1, leading to an amino group there, but this is just a guess.

Alternatively, perhaps the benzynes can react in two different ways, leading to two different products.

Wait, but the problem is asking how many possible organic products are formed. So, if the reaction can proceed in only one way, the number of products would be one. But if there are multiple pathways, leading to different products, the number increases.

Alternatively, perhaps the benzynes can form in more than one way, leading to different products. But in this case, the starting material has a fixed structure, so the elimination can only happen in one way.

Wait, but perhaps when the benzynes forms, it can undergo ring-opening in two different positions, leading to different products. For example, attack at C1 and attack at C6 would give different products.

So, if the attack occurs at C1, the product would have the amino group at C1, and the dimethylamino at C2. If the attack occurs at C6, the product would have the amino group at C6, and the dimethylamino at C2.

But wait, the original structure is 1-bromo-2-dimethylaminobenzene. After elimination, the benzynes has the triple bond between C1 and C6, and the substituent at C2 is dimethylamino.

So, when the triple bond opens, adding an amino group to either end would give two different products, right?

So, product 1: attack at C1 gives 1-amino-2-dimethylaminobenzene.

Product 2: attack at C6 gives 6-amino-2-dimethylaminobenzene.

But wait, benzene is a symmetrical ring, so the positions 1 and 6 are equivalent in some cases, but here, the substituents are at 2 and 1/6. So, perhaps the two products are distinct and count as separate products.

So, that would give two possible products.

But wait, another possibility: could the benzynes also dimerize, forming a dimer product? If that's possible, then that would add another product, making it three in total.

But I'm not certain if dimerization occurs under these conditions. The presence of NaNH2 in ammonia might not favor dimerization, but it's possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the benzynes can undergo further elimination or rearrangement, leading to more products.

Wait, but the question is about the number of products. So, if I consider the two possible attack positions, that's two products. If the benzynes can also dimerize, then that's a third product.

But I'm not certain about the dimerization in this case. Alternatively, perhaps the benzynes doesn't dimerize, and only two products form.

Wait, but the starting material is a bromobenzene with substituents. The elimination forms the benzynes, which then reacts with ammonia. So, the main products would be the two possible aminobenzene derivatives.

So, in that case, the number of products would be two, which is option C.

Wait, but wait, another possibility: if the benzynes can attack in such a way that the amino group is added to either end, but due to steric hindrance or directing effects, only one product is formed preferentially.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed via benzynes. Maybe it's a different mechanism.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the reaction is a substitution reaction. NaNH2 is a strong base, but perhaps it's also a good nucleophile. Wait, but in aromatic substitution, substitution usually occurs under different conditions. For example, nucleophilic aromatic substitution typically requires a meta-directing group, which is not the case here.

Wait, the substituent at C2 is a strong activating group, which is ortho/para directing. So, in a substitution reaction, the nucleophile would attack at the para position relative to the substituent.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the base deprotonates the ring, making it more susceptible to substitution.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a coupling, but again, I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is an elimination followed by a trapping reaction. For example, the benzynes could react with another molecule of the starting material to form a dimer, but that would require a specific condition.

Alternatively, perhaps the benzynes can undergo a ring-opening via attack by ammonia to form a diaminobenzene, but given the substituents, that would lead to specific products.

Wait, but perhaps the benzynes opens up in a way that introduces two amino groups, but I'm not sure.

Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Let me try to summarize.

The starting material is 1-bromo-2-dimethylaminobenzene.

Elimination with NaNH2 forms benzynes with the triple bond between C1 and C6.

The benzynes can react with ammonia in different ways, possibly leading to products with amino groups added at different positions.

Possibly, two products are formed: one with the amino group at C1 and the other at C6.

But considering that the substituent is at C2, the attack at C1 would be adjacent to the substituent, which might lead to a more stable product, perhaps via steric effects or electronic effects.

Alternatively, perhaps the attack can occur symmetrically, leading to only one major product.

Wait, but the question is about the number of possible products, regardless of which is major.

If two attack positions are possible, leading to two different products, then the answer would be C) 2.

But wait, another angle: the benzynes might not form because the H on C6 is not acidic enough or because the substituents block elimination.

Wait, but the substituent is at C2, which is adjacent to C1 (Br). So, the H on C6 (which is para to Br) might be more acidic and thus susceptible to deprotonation by NaNH2.

So, the elimination should occur, forming the benzynes.

Assuming that, the benzynes can then react in two different ways, leading to two products.

Thus, the number of possible products is 2, which is option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The reaction involves treating 1-bromo-2-dimethylaminobenzene with NaNH₂ in condensed ammonia. The key steps are as follows:

1. **Structure of the Starting Material**: The compound is 1-bromo-2-dimethylaminobenzene, where bromine is at position 1 and the dimethylamino group (-N(CH₃)₂) is at position 2. The dimethylamino group is a strong electron-donating, ortho/para-directing group.

2. **Reaction with NaNH₂**: NaNH₂ is a strong base that facilitates dehydrohalogenation. The H adjacent to the bromine at position 1 is abstracted, leading to the elimination of HBr and the formation of a benzyne intermediate. The triple bond forms between positions 1 and 6 of the benzene ring.

3. **Reactivity of Benzyne**: Benzyne is a highly reactive antiaromatic species. In the presence of ammonia (NH₃), it can react via nucleophilic attack at either end of the triple bond (positions 1 or 6). This results in two possible products:
   - **Product 1**: Ammonia attacks at position 1, forming 1-amino-2-dimethylaminobenzene.
   - **Product 2**: Ammonia attacks at position 6, forming 6-amino-2-dimethylaminobenzene.

4. **Symmetry and Distinct Products**: The substituent at position 2 (dimethylamino group) influences the reaction, but the two possible attack positions (1 and 6) lead to distinct products. Thus, the reaction yields two different organic products.

5. **Dimerization or Other Pathways**: While benzyne can dimerize under certain conditions, there is no indication in the problem that dimerization occurs here. The focus is on the products of the reaction with ammonia.

Based on the analysis, the reaction produces two distinct organic products.
