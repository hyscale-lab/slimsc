Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this organic chemistry problem. Let me break it down step by step.

The question involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember that adamantane is a diamondoid structure, which is pretty rigid. So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have two bromine atoms on adjacent carbons in the adamantane framework.

First reaction: Heating with excess KOH at 240°C. KOH is a strong base. I think this is an elimination reaction. When vicinal dihalides (two halides on adjacent carbons) react with a strong base, they typically undergo dehydrohalogenation to form alkenes. So, the product here would probably be 1,3-adamantadiene or something similar. Wait, but let me think about the structure. Adamantane has a structure where each carbon is connected in a diamond-like lattice. So, if the two bromines are on adjacent carbons, eliminating them would form a double bond. But wait, in adamantane, each carbon is connected to three others, so a double bond might not be possible in the same way as in a typical alkane. Maybe it becomes an allene or something else. Oh wait, no, elimination would form a double bond. So, product 1 is 1,3-adamantadiene or maybe an annulene? Hmm, perhaps I should think about the NMR data.

The 1H NMR of product 1 shows: 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). Also, an IR peak at 1720 cm⁻¹. Wait, IR at 1720 is usually a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. But product 1 was formed by elimination of HBr from 1,3-dibromoadamantane. So wait, if it's an elimination forming a double bond, why is there a carbonyl? Oh, maybe I'm wrong about the reaction. Alternatively, maybe it's a substitution reaction. Wait, KOH could cause elimination, but in some cases, especially with more hindered structures, substitution might be possible. Hmm, but 1,3-dibromoadamantane is a vicinal dihalide. Vicinal dihalides usually undergo elimination upon treatment with strong bases like KOH. So product 1 is likely a diene.

Wait, but the IR has a peak at 1720, which is a carbonyl. So maybe product 1 isn't the diene. What else could it be? Oh, wait! Maybe it's a substitution reaction. Since there are two bromides, perhaps two dehydrohalogenation steps or something else. Alternatively, maybe it's a ring-opening. Let me think again. If 1,3-dibromoadamantane is treated with KOH, perhaps it's an E2 elimination, forming an alkene. But then why the IR shows a carbonyl?

Wait a second, perhaps the reaction isn't elimination but something else. Oh, wait, maybe it's a nucleophilic substitution. But in such a rigid structure, SN2 is unlikely due to steric hindrance. Alternatively, maybe it's an elimination forming an epoxide? No, that doesn't fit. Hmm, maybe the product isn't an alkene. Wait, the IR at 1720 could be an ester or ketone. Wait, but if KOH is used, maybe it's a nucleophilic substitution to form a diol? No, because the IR here isn't showing an O-H stretch, which would be broad around 3300. The product 1's NMR has a peak at 4.79 ppm, which is about where an ether or an alcohol's protons would appear, but maybe it's a diol. But again, with KOH, perhaps elimination is more likely.

Wait, another thought: maybe the reaction forms a ketone. If the base abstracts a beta proton, leading to a carbocation, which could then lose HBr and form a carbonyl. But in adamantane, forming a carbocation might be difficult because of the structure's stability. Alternatively, perhaps it's a ring-opening to form a ketone. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the product is 1,3-adamantanone. Wait, but how would that happen? From 1,3-dibromoadamantane, with KOH. Maybe it's a double dehydrohalogenation with formation of a ketone. But that doesn't quite make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction forms an epoxide, but I don't see how that would give a carbonyl.

Wait, the IR peak at 1720 suggests a carbonyl. So perhaps product 1 is a diketone or something with a carbonyl group. Alternatively, maybe it's a di-substituted ether, but the oxygen in KOH could be involved.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a double elimination to form an enol. Hmm, but that's a stretch.

Wait, maybe it's a benzidine rearrangement, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Hofmann elimination, but that's for amines.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is not from elimination or substitution but from some kind of rearrangement. Wait, another approach: looking at the NMR.

The NMR of product 1 shows 4.79 ppm (2H), which might be an -OCH2- group or maybe a CH2 group adjacent to an oxygen. The 2.41-2.23 region (10H) probably corresponds to the adamantane ring, which is a set of equivalent CH groups. The 1.94 ppm (2H) could be another CH2 group, perhaps next to the oxygen or part of the ring.

If product 1 is an epoxide, the NMR might show some deshielded protons. Alternatively, if it's a diol, but the IR doesn't show broad peaks which would be expected from OH groups. So perhaps it's an ether. But then again, the IR at 1720 doesn't align with that.

Wait, the IR absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹ is very strong for a carbonyl. So maybe product 1 is a ketone. Let's think: If 1,3-dibromoadamantane reacts with KOH, perhaps a dehydrohalogenation occurs, leading to the formation of a ketone. How?

Alternatively, perhaps the KOH is acting as a base, leading to the formation of an enolate. But in such a rigid structure, maybe it's more about elimination.

Wait, perhaps each Br is on a bridgehead carbon. So eliminating two HBr molecules would form two double bonds, but that might not be possible in adamantane. Alternatively, maybe each elimination forms a double bond, but in a different position.

Alternatively, perhaps the two Br atoms are on adjacent bridgehead carbons. Eliminating two HBr molecules would form a diene. But then, why the IR shows a carbonyl?

Hmmm, maybe I'm stuck here. Let me move to the next step.

After product 1 is formed, it's heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. Aluminum isopropoxide is a Lewis acid, often used as a catalyst in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. But product 1 has a carbonyl group, as indicated by IR. So perhaps product 2 is an acetylation product. Friedel-Crafts acylation would introduce an acyl group into an aromatic ring, but adamantane isn't aromatic. Wait, perhaps the carbonyl is part of an ester or ketone, and the Lewis acid facilitates some kind of acylation or alkylation.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is a ketone, and heating with aluminum isopropoxide (which can be a catalyst) leads to some kind of rearrangement or further reaction. Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diene, and aluminum isopropoxide might facilitate some cycloaddition or other reaction, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe product 1 is 1,3-adamantadiene, and product 2 is the Diels-Alder adduct with something. But aluminum isopropoxide isn't typically used for that. Alternatively, maybe product 2 is a bridged ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diol, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I should think about product 1's structure more carefully. If it's a carbonyl, perhaps it's a ketone. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane upon treatment with KOH gives 1,3-adamantanone. How? Let's imagine: maybe the two Br atoms are on adjacent carbons, and upon elimination of two HBr molecules, a ketone is formed. Wait, that's possible. For example, if each Br is on a CH2 group adjacent to each other, eliminating HBr twice could form a double bond and a carbonyl group. Wait, but how would that happen? Maybe each elimination produces a double bond, but that's not leading to a ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure loses two HBr in a way that forms a carbonyl. Let me think about the structure of adamantane. It's a diamondoid structure with four cyclohexane rings fused together. Each bridgehead carbon is connected to three other bridgehead carbons. So, if 1 and 3 positions are bridgehead carbons, each bearing a Br, perhaps eliminating two HBr would form a conjugated dienone or something. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps each Br is on a bridgehead, and elimination leads to the formation of a ketone. Wait, maybe the structure becomes a ketone when two Brs are eliminated. For example, if each Br is on a CH2 group, and they lose HBr, forming a double bond and a carbonyl. But I'm not quite getting it.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a single elimination to form a carbonyl. Wait, but 1,3-dibromoadamantane has two Br atoms. Maybe the base abstracts a proton adjacent to one Br, leading to elimination of HBr and formation of a double bond. But that's just one elimination, but there are two Br atoms. Alternatively, perhaps two eliminations occur, each leading to a double bond, but how would that form a carbonyl?

I think I'm stuck on the first step. Let me try to think about the next steps.

Product 2 is then treated with ozone at -78°C, followed by dimethyl sulfide, giving product 3. Ozone is used in ozonolysis, which cleaves alkenes into carbonyl groups. So, product 2 must have a double bond. Ozonolysis would break that double bond into two carbonyl groups.

Looking at the NMR of product 3, the question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen, excluding those that exchange (like OH or NH).

So, product 3 must have some carbonyl groups from ozonolysis. So product 2 must have a double bond that is cleaved by ozone.

Let me retrace:

1,3-dibromoadamantane → product 1 (with carbonyl, IR at 1720) via KOH.

Product 1 → product 2 via Al(isoprop)3.

Product 2 → product 3 via ozonolysis and dimethyl sulfide.

Assuming product 3 has carbonyl groups, perhaps from ozonolysis.

But wait, product 2 must have a double bond. Because ozonolysis cleaves double bonds.

So, product 2 must have a double bond. So what reaction with aluminum isopropoxide would form a double bond?

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diol, and then product 2 is an alkene formed via elimination using Al isopropoxide as a base.

Wait, Al isopropoxide is a Lewis acid, which can help in various reactions, like esterification, or in some eliminations.

Wait, if product 1 is a diol, and treated with a Lewis acid, perhaps the diol loses water to form a double bond via elimination, making product 2 an alkene.

If that's the case, then product 2 would have a double bond which would undergo ozonolysis in the next step.

So, the steps would be:

1,3-dibromoadamantane → KOH → diol (product 1)

Diol (product 1) → Al isopropoxide → alkene (product 2)

Alkene → ozonolysis → cleavage into carbonyl groups (product 3)

But wait, why would KOH produce a diol from 1,3-dibromoadamantane? Because with two Br atoms, perhaps it's a 1,3-diol. But the IR of product 1 doesn't show O-H stretch, so maybe it's not a diol.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial reaction forms a ketone (product 1), which then undergoes some reaction with Al isopropoxide to form an alkene (product 2 via elimination). Then, product 2 undergoes ozonolysis to form product 3 with carbonyl groups.

So, let me outline the possible structures.

Product 1: 1,3-adamantanone (maybe a ketone somewhere in the adamantane structure). IR at 1720 cm⁻¹ supports this.

Product 2: If product 1 is a ketone, Al isopropoxide could act as a base, leading to elimination of an alcohol or another group to form an alkene. Wait, but a ketone typically doesn't have leaving groups adjacent to the carbonyl. Hmm, perhaps product 1 is an alcohol, and Al isopropoxide is used to eliminate and form an alkene.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a diol, and Al isopropoxide is a base that helps eliminate two water molecules to form a double bond. So, product 2 would be an alkene.

But then, product 1, the diol, would have two OH groups. However, the NMR of product 1 doesn't show a broad peak around 1-5 ppm which is typical for OH groups. So maybe product 1 isn't a diol.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a geminal diol, but that's less likely.

Wait, another angle: the NMR data for product 1.

- 4.79 ppm (2H): Maybe a CH2 group next to an electronegative atom, like O. Or maybe an OCH2 group.

- 2.41-2.23 (10H): That's a lot of protons, probably from the adamantane structure, which has multiple equivalent CH groups. Adamantane typically has protons around 2 ppm. So these must be the bridgehead or adjacent CH groups.

- 1.94 ppm (2H): Maybe a CH2 group, perhaps adjacent to an oxygen or part of a ring.

If the 4.79 ppm is an OCH2 group, then product 1 could be an ether. But with IR at 1720, maybe it's an ester. Alternatively, perhaps it's a hemiacetal or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a bromoalkene? No, because KOH likely leads to elimination, but the IR suggests a carbonyl.

Wait, maybe product 1 is a carbonyl-containing compound, and product 2 is an enol ether or something else.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the ozonolysis step.

Ozonolysis of a double bond typically cleaves it into two carbonyl groups. So, product 3 would have carbonyl groups. Let's say the double bond in product 2 is between carbons A and B. Ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyls, each connected to the respective parts.

The NMR of product 3 is what we're interested in. The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen, excluding those exchanging with solvent.

The most deshielded protons would likely be those near electron-withdrawing groups, such as carbonyls.

If product 3 has carbonyl groups, perhaps the adjacent hydrogens would be deshielded.

Now, considering the coupling patterns:

If a proton is adjacent to two neighboring protons, like in a CH2 group next to a carbonyl, it would couple with both, leading to a triplet.

Wait, no, if it's a CH2 group next to a carbonyl, each proton on the CH2 would couple with two others on the same group. But that's usually a triplet (if all are equivalent) due to coupling between the two protons on the same CH2.

But wait, in the case of ozonolysis, if the alkene is between two CH2 groups, cleavage would produce two carbonyl groups. For example, if the structure is CH2=CH2, ozonolysis would give two formaldehyde groups. But that's a simple case.

But in our case, the structure is more complex. Let's think about a more realistic scenario.

Suppose product 2 is an alkene within the adamantane structure, say, 1,3-adamantadiene. Ozonolysis would break each double bond into carbonyl groups. Wait, but ozonolysis of a conjugated diene would typically break into two carbonyls. Alternatively, if the diene is isolated, each double bond would break.

Wait, but product 2 is formed by heating product 1 with Al isopropoxide. If product 1 is a ketone, perhaps product 2 is an enone (conjugated enol ether or something similar) that could have a double bond adjacent to the ketone. Ozonolysis of such a structure would cleave the double bond.

Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is a diene, and ozonolysis would cleave each double bond into carbonyl groups.

Wait, but I'm getting tangled. Let me try to outline the possible structures.

1. 1,3-dibromoadamantane → KOH → product 1 (maybe 1,3-adamantanone)

2. 1,3-adamantanone → Al isopropoxide → product 2 (possibly an enol ether or some elimination product, introducing a double bond)

3. product 2 → ozonolysis → product 3 (with carbonyl groups)

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is 1,3-adamantadiene, and product 2 is a more substituted alkene. Then ozonolysis would cleave it.

But I'm not making progress. Let me try to think about the NMR of product 3.

The most deshielded proton would be near a carbonyl group. So, perhaps it's a carbonyl-adjacent CH group.

In ozonolysis, each cleavage adds O groups. So, product 3 might have two or more carbonyl groups, each adjacent to CH2 or CH groups.

If the deshielded proton is part of a CH2 group next to a carbonyl, it would be split into a triplet due to coupling with the two adjacent protons. But wait, in CH2 next to a carbonyl, each H would couple with the other H in the same CH2 group, leading to a triplet.

Alternatively, if it's a CH group adjacent to a carbonyl and another CH2 group, the coupling could be more complex.

Wait, let me think of a specific example. Suppose after ozonolysis, product 3 has a structure like (CH2)CO. The CH2 would be adjacent to the carbonyl. Each proton in the CH2 would couple with the other in the same group, giving a triplet. But if the CH2 is next to another group that has protons, the coupling could be more.

Alternatively, perhaps the most deshielded proton is part of an acetal or something, but that's less likely.

Alternatively, maybe the deshielded proton is part of a di-substituted alkene, but that doesn't fit with ozonolysis.

Wait, ozonolysis breaks double bonds into carbonyls. So, any protons adjacent to the carbonyl would be deshielded.

So, suppose product 3 has a structure like O=C-CH2-CH2-CO-O.

Wait, perhaps more accurately, if product 2 was an alkene, product 3 would have two carbonyls. For example, if product 2 was CH2=CH-adamantane, ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl groups attached to the adamantane.

But then, considering the coupling, perhaps the protons adjacent to the carbonyl would be split.

Wait, let's imagine product 3 has a structure like O=C-CH2-CH2-CO-. The middle CH2 groups would have protons that are adjacent to carbonyls. Each CH2 would have two protons, which would couple with each other, resulting in a triplet.

But wait, the most deshielded proton is the one closest to the carbonyl. So, if the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-CO, the CH2 next to the carbonyl would have protons that are split by the neighboring CH2. Each proton in the first CH2 (next to carbonyl) would couple with two protons in the adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet of triplets? Or perhaps a quartet.

Wait, no. Let me think about the coupling. Each proton in the first CH2 (next to carbonyl) would be adjacent to two protons in the same CH2 group (each coupling with each other, leading to a triplet), and also adjacent to two protons in the next CH2 group. So each proton in the first CH2 would couple with the two protons in their own group (split into triplet) and also with the two protons in the adjacent group (split into another triplet). So overall, it would be a triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, the coupling could be more complex.

Wait, actually, each proton in the first CH2 would be split by the two protons in the same group and the two in the adjacent group. So, each has 2 + 2 = 4 neighboring protons. Wait, no, because each H in the first CH2 is next to two Hs in the same group and two in the adjacent group. So each H has coupling with four Hs. But in reality, the coupling is J with adjacent Hs, so for each H in the first CH2, the coupling would be with the two Hs in the same CH2 and the two Hs in the next CH2. So each H would have a triplet from the same group and a quartet from the adjacent group. Wait, no, because each H in the first CH2 is adjacent to the two Hs in the same CH2 (so triplet), but also adjacent to the two Hs in the next CH2 (another triplet). So the overall splitting would be a triplet of triplets.

Wait, but if the coupling constants are similar, the splitting might be more complex. Alternatively, perhaps the J values are different, leading to a doublet of triplets or something else.

Alternatively, maybe the coupling is between two adjacent Hs in the same CH2 group, leading to a triplet, and perhaps another coupling with a different group.

But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think of another possibility.

Another scenario: the ozonolysis produces a diketone, where each carbonyl is attached to a CH group. So, if the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-CO, then each CH2 group is next to a carbonyl. The protons on the CH2 next to the carbonyl would each couple with the two protons on the same CH2 (giving a triplet) and would also couple with the two protons on the adjacent CH2 (another triplet). So, each would be a triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, perhaps the coupling is only between the neighboring CH2 groups, leading to a triplet of triplets.

Wait, but the question is about the most deshielded hydrogen. The deshielded ones are likely closer to the carbonyl. So, the Hs on the CH2 next to the carbonyl would be more deshielded.

In such a case, each of these Hs would be split by the two Hs on their own CH2 (triplet) and the two Hs on the adjacent CH2 (another triplet), leading to a triplet of triplets.

So, looking at the options, option B is a triplet of triplets.

Another possibility is that the H is part of a CH2 group between two carbonyls, each causing coupling, leading to a more complex splitting. But I think the triplet of triplets makes sense.

Alternatively, suppose the H is part of a CH3 group. No, that's not likely. Alternatively, maybe it's a CH group, but that would split into a doublet, which isn't one of the options.

Wait, maybe the structure is such that the H is part of a CH2 group that's next to a carbonyl and another CH2 group. So the H would have coupling with the two Hs in its own CH2 (triplet) and coupling with the two Hs in the adjacent CH2 (another triplet). So each H would be a triplet of triplets.

Thus, the correct answer would be option B: triplet of triplets.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Upon heating with excess KOH, the product (product 1) is formed. The IR spectrum of product 1 shows a strong absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹, indicative of a carbonyl group. The NMR data suggests the presence of a CH₂ group at 4.79 ppm, likely adjacent to an electronegative atom, and adamantane-like protons in the range of 2.41-2.23 ppm (10H) and 1.94 ppm (2H). This strongly suggests that product 1 is 1,3-adamantanone, a ketone formed via elimination of two HBr molecules.

Next, product 1 is heated with aluminum isopropoxide, a Lewis acid, to form product 2. This step likely involves the elimination of a proton to form a double bond, resulting in an enone (conjugated ketone and alkene). The double bond in product 2 is then cleaved by ozonolysis at -78°C, followed by the addition of dimethyl sulfide, to form product 3. Ozonolysis cleaves the double bond, producing two carbonyl groups.

In the NMR spectrum of product 3, the most deshielded hydrogen is likely adjacent to a carbonyl group. This hydrogen would couple with the two protons in its own CH₂ group (resulting in a triplet) and the two protons in the adjacent CH₂ group (another triplet). This combined splitting results in a triplet of triplets for the most deshielded hydrogen.

Thus, the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is a triplet of triplets.

Answer: B
