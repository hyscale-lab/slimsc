Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem. Let me read it carefully and break it down step by step.

The question is about the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. The given information is:

- Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. So, R1 = 1.5 * R2.
- The mass of Star_1 is also 1.5 times that of Star_2. So, M1 = 1.5 * M2.
- The wavelengths at which both stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, wait, that's about the peak wavelength, which I think relates to their temperatures. Because, you know, from Wien's Law, λ_max is proportional to 1/T. So if λ_max is the same, their temperatures are the same.

Also, the radial velocities are 0 for Star_1 and 700 km/s for Star_2. Hmm, radial velocity—wait, but when we calculate luminosity, radial velocity might not directly affect it, unless it's about their actual velocities affecting their brightness. Wait, no, luminosity is an intrinsic property, so maybe the radial velocity isn't directly used here. Unless it's about Doppler shift, but I'm not sure. The question says the astronomers computed luminosity based on black body radiation, so perhaps the radial velocities are just additional info that might not be needed for this particular calculation. Or maybe they are for a possible follow-up question. For now, I'll focus on the given data for luminosity.

So, the stars are black bodies, so their luminosity is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR² σ T^4. Because the question says to compute luminosity based on that, so I don't think the radial velocity comes into play here.

Given that, the problem asks by what factor is L1 greater than L2.

Wait, but what's the relation between their temperatures? Oh, because the peak wavelengths are the same, so their temperatures are the same. Because λ_max is inversely proportional to T. So T1 = T2.

So, L1/L2 = (R1² T1^4) / (R2² T2^4) ) = (R1^2 / R2^2) * (T1^4 / T2^4). But since T1 = T2, the T terms cancel out. So L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2.

R1 is 1.5 R2, so (1.5)^2 is 2.25. So L1 is 2.25 times L2. So the factor is 2.25. Looking at the options, option A is ~2.25.

Wait, but wait—does the mass matter here? The problem gives the mass ratio, but since luminosity for main-sequence stars depends on mass, but in this case, the stars are not necessarily on the main sequence? Or is the given info about mass a red herring?

Hmm. Let me think. Oh, wait, the problem says that the stars are considered as black bodies, so perhaps the given mass is irrelevant for this particular calculation. Because the luminosity as a black body depends only on radius and temperature. So the mass might be a distractor. So the calculation would go as done before.

Wait, but why would the mass be given? Maybe to test if the student is tricked into using it. But the question is about luminosity based on black body radiation, so I think I can ignore the mass.

So, with that, the factor is R1^2/R2^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25. So the correct answer should be option A.

But wait, the options are A) ~2.25, B) ~2.32, C) ~2.35, D) ~2.23. So A is 2.25. That matches.

But another thought—the problem mentions radial velocities. The radial velocities are given as 0 and 700 km/s. How does that affect the calculation? Oh, perhaps it's about the Doppler shift affecting the observed wavelengths. But since we're talking about the actual emission from the star, the peak wavelength is determined by the star's temperature, not the radial velocity. Because if a star is moving towards us, the wavelengths get blueshifted, but the actual emission spectrum's peak is determined by the star's rest frame. Wait, but the problem says that the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So if Star_2 is moving away or towards us, would that affect the observed wavelength?

Wait, the problem states that the observed brightest wavelengths are the same. So perhaps the Doppler shift is taken into account. So the actual temperature would be different, but after considering the radial velocity, their observed λ_max is the same. Hmm, that complicates things.

Wait, let me think again. The peak wavelengths observed are the same. So if a star is moving towards us, the observed wavelength is shorter (blueshifted), so the star itself must be hotter. Conversely, if moving away, observed wavelength longer (redshifted), so star is intrinsically hotter.

Wait, the given λ_max observed is same for both stars. So perhaps:

Star_1's actual λ_max is λ1, and Star_2's is λ2. But due to Doppler shift, the observed λ_max for Star_2 is (λ2 * sqrt( (1+v/c)/(1-v/c) )) ) or something like that. Wait, no, the Doppler effect formula for wavelength is λ_observed = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + v_r/c) / (1 - v_r/c) ) ), where v_r is the radial velocity (positive if moving away). But I'm not sure about the exact formula; perhaps it's better to think in terms of the relativistic Doppler shift.

Wait, the Doppler shift formula for light is more accurately written as:

λ_observed = λ_emitted * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

But in this case, the observed λ_max is the same for both stars. So let's denote λ_obs as the same for both.

For Star_1, radial velocity v1 is 0, so λ1_obs = λ1_rest * sqrt( (1+0)/(1-0) ) = λ1_rest.

For Star_2, v2 is 700 km/s. Let's assume it's moving away (since v is positive if moving away). Then λ2_obs = λ2_rest * sqrt( (1 + 700/(c)) / (1 - 700/(c)) )

But wait, since the observed λ_max is the same for both, λ1_obs = λ2_obs.

So λ1_rest = λ2_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) )

Wait, but the problem says that the observed λ_max is the same for both. So:

λ1_rest = λ_observed (since Star_1's velocity is zero)

λ2_rest * sqrt( (1 + v2/c)/(1 - v2/c) ) ) = λ_observed

So λ1_rest = λ2_rest * sqrt( (1 + v2/c)/(1 - v2/c) )

But the actual temperatures are determined by λ_rest. So using Wien's law, T = B / λ_max, where B is Wien's displacement constant.

So T1 = B / λ1_rest

T2 = B / λ2_rest

So λ1_rest = B / T1

λ2_rest = B / T2

Substituting into the earlier equation:

B/T1 = (B/T2) * sqrt( (1 + v2/c)/(1 - v2/c) )

Simplify:

1/T1 = (1/T2) * sqrt( (1 + v2/c)/(1 - v2/c) )

Take reciprocal on both sides:

T1 = T2 / sqrt( (1 + v2/c)/(1 - v2/c) )

= T2 * sqrt( (1 - v2/c)/(1 + v2/c) )

Hmm, that's getting a bit complicated. Let me plug in the numbers.

v2 is 700 km/s. Let's calculate v2/c. The speed of light c is approximately 3e5 km/s, so 300,000 km/s.

v2/c = 700 / 3e5 = 7e2 / 3e5 = 7/(300) ≈ 0.02333.

So (1 + v2/c) ≈ 1.02333, and (1 - v2/c) ≈ 0.97667.

Compute the ratio (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) = (0.97667)/(1.02333) ≈ 0.9545.

The square root of that is sqrt(0.9545) ≈ 0.977.

So T1 ≈ T2 * 0.977.

So T1 is about 97.7% of T2.

Wait, but earlier we thought that because the observed λ_max is the same, the temperatures would be the same. But now, considering the Doppler shift, that might not be the case.

So now, the temperature of Star_1 is lower than Star_2, because Star_2 is moving away, causing its emitted light to be redshifted. So the observed λ_max is same, but Star_2's actual λ_max is shorter (hotter) than Star_1's.

Wait, let me think again.

Wait, if Star_2 is moving away, then the observed λ_max is longer than its actual emitted λ_max. So the actual λ_max is shorter, implying higher temperature.

Because for Star_2, λ_observed = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

If v is positive (moving away), then λ_observed is longer than λ_rest. So the actual λ_rest is shorter than λ_observed. So T2 = B / λ_rest, which would be higher because λ_rest is shorter.

So in that case, T2 > T1.

Wait, let me think. Star_1 has v=0, so λ_observed1 = λ_rest1.

Star_2 has v=700 km/s, moving away, so λ_observed2 = λ_rest2 * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ) )

Since observed wavelengths are same: λ_observed1 = λ_observed2.

So λ_rest2 = λ_observed2 / sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

But λ_observed2 = λ_observed1 = λ_rest1.

So λ_rest2 = λ_rest1 * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

Which means λ_rest2 = λ_rest1 * sqrt( (1 - 0.02333)/(1 + 0.02333) )

As before, that's sqrt(0.97667/1.02333) ≈ sqrt(0.9545) ≈ 0.977.

So λ_rest2 ≈ 0.977 * λ_rest1.

Which implies T2 = B / λ_rest2 ≈ (B / λ_rest1) * (1/0.977) ≈ T1 * (1/0.977) ≈ T1 * 1.023.

So T2 is about 2.3% hotter than T1.

Hmm, so earlier, I thought T1 = T2, but that's only if you don't account for Doppler shift. But the problem says that the observed λ_max is same, so you have to account for Doppler shift. So now, the actual temperatures are different.

So now, the luminosity depends on both radius and temperature.

L1 = 4π R1^2 σ T1^4

L2 = 4π R2^2 σ T2^4

So L1/L2 = (R1^2 T1^4) / (R2^2 T2^4 )

We have R1 = 1.5 R2.

T1 and T2 are related as T2 ≈ T1 * 1.023.

So T2 = 1.023 * T1.

So T2^4 = (1.023)^4 * T1^4.

Putting it all together:

L1/L2 = ( (1.5 R2)^2 * T1^4 ) / ( R2^2 * (1.023)^4 T1^4 )

Simplify:

= ( (2.25 R2^2 ) * T1^4 ) / ( R2^2 * (1.023)^4 T1^4 )

R2^2 and T1^4 cancel out.

So L1/L2 = 2.25 / (1.023)^4.

Calculate 1.023^4. Let's compute 1.023 to the fourth power.

Compute step by step:

1.023^2 = (approx) 1.023 * 1.023 ≈ 1.0465

Then, 1.0465^2 ≈ 1.0465 * 1.0465.

Let me compute that: 1.0465 * 1.0465.

= (1 + 0.0465)^2 = 1 + 2*(0.0465) + (0.0465)^2 ≈ 1 + 0.093 + 0.002162 ≈ 1.09516.

So 1.023^4 ≈ approx 1.09516.

So L1/L2 ≈ 2.25 / 1.09516 ≈ let's compute that.

2.25 ÷ 1.09516 ≈ let me see.

1.09516 * 2 = 2.19032. 2.25 is 0.05968 more than 2.19032.

So 2.19032 is 2*1.09516.

So 2.25 /1.09516 = 2 + (0.05968 / 1.09516 )

0.05968 / 1.09516 ≈ approx 0.0545.

So total is 2.0545.

Wait, that's approximately 2.0545, which is about 2.05.

But the options given are ~2.23, 2.25, 2.32, 2.35. So 2.05 isn't among them. So perhaps my calculation was wrong.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the Doppler shift part. Let me recheck.

Wait, the Doppler shift formula can be approximated for non-relativistic speeds. Let's consider that the velocity is small compared to c. So perhaps I can use the approximation.

The formula for Doppler shift when v << c is:

λ_obs ≈ λ_rest * (1 + v/c )

But wait, that's for recessional velocity. So if a star is moving away at velocity v, the observed wavelength is λ = λ_rest (1 + v/c )

In this case, since v is much less than c (700 km/s vs 3e5 km/s), the approximation holds.

So, for Star_2: λ_obs_2 = λ_rest_2 * (1 + v2/c )

Similarly, for Star_1, λ_obs_1 = λ_rest_1 (since v1=0).

Given that λ_obs_1 = λ_obs_2 = λ.

So:

λ_rest_1 = λ

λ_rest_2 = λ / (1 + v2/c )

Because λ_obs_2 = λ_rest_2 (1 + v2/c ) = λ.

So, λ_rest_2 = λ / (1 + v2/c )

Then, using Wien's law: T = B / λ_rest.

So, T1 = B / λ_rest_1 = B / λ.

T2 = B / λ_rest_2 = B / [ λ / (1 + v2/c) ) ] = B (1 + v2/c ) / λ = T1 (1 + v2/c )

Thus, T2 = T1 (1 + v2/c )

So with v2=700 km/s, v2/c=700/3e5=0.002333 (since 3e5 is 300,000, so 700/300000=0.002333).

So, T2 ≈ T1 * (1 + 0.002333) ≈ T1 * 1.002333.

So, T2 ≈ 1.002333 * T1.

So, T2^4 ≈ (1.002333)^4 * T1^4.

(1.002333)^4 ≈ let's compute that.

Approximating using binomial expansion: (1+x)^n ≈1 + nx + (n(n-1)/2) x² + ... where x is small.

x=0.002333, n=4.

(1.002333)^4 ≈ 1 +4*(0.002333) + (4*3/2)*(0.002333)^2 + (4*3*2/6)*(0.002333)^3 + (4*3*2*1/24)*(0.002333)^4 )

Simplify each term:

1st term: 1.

2nd term: 4 * 0.002333 ≈ 0.009332.

3rd term: 6 * (0.002333)^2 ≈ 6 * 0.00000544 ≈ 0.0000326.

4th term: 4 * (0.002333)^3 ≈ 4 * (0.0000000125) ≈ 0.00000005.

5th term: 1 * (0.002333)^4 ≈ 0.0000000003.

Adding all up:

1 + 0.009332 = 1.009332.

Plus 0.0000326 → 1.0093646.

Plus 0.00000005 → 1.00936465.

Plus 0.0000000003 → 1.0093646503.

So approximately 1.009365.

So T2^4 ≈ T1^4 * 1.009365.

So, now, L1/L2 = (R1^2 T1^4 ) / ( R2^2 T2^4 )

= ( (1.5 R2 )^2 / R2^2 ) * ( T1^4 / (T1^4 * 1.009365) )

Simplify:

= (2.25) * (1 / 1.009365 )

2.25 / 1.009365 ≈ let's compute that.

1.009365 is approximately 1.009365.

So 2.25 / 1.009365 ≈ ?

Let me compute 2.25 / 1.009365.

Well, 1.009365 ≈ 1.009365.

I can compute 2.25 / 1.009365 as follows:

Let me calculate 1.009365 * 2.23 ≈ ?

Wait, alternatively, perhaps compute 2.25 ÷ 1.009365.

Since 1.009365 is about 1.009365 ≈ 1.0094.

So 2.25 ÷ 1.0094 ≈ approximately?

Well, 1.0094 is about 1 + 0.0094.

So 2.25 ÷ (1 + 0.0094) ≈ 2.25 * (1 - 0.0094) ≈ 2.25 * 0.9906 ≈ 2.227.

So approximately 2.227.

Looking at the options, option D is ~2.23.

Wait, but before, without considering the Doppler shift, it was 2.25 (option A). But when considering the Doppler shift, it's about 2.23.

But wait, what's the correct approach? The problem says the observed λ_max is the same. So the Doppler shift must be accounted for because the stars are moving relative to us.

So, the initial calculation without considering the Doppler shift would have given 2.25, but the correct approach leads to about 2.23.

So the factor is approximately 2.23.

Which is option D.

So the answer would be D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2, we use the Stefan-Boltzmann law for blackbody radiation:

\[
L = 4\pi R^2 \sigma T^4
\]

The ratio of the luminosities is given by:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{R_1^2 T_1^4}{R_2^2 T_2^4}
\]

### Key Information:
1. **Radius Ratio**: \( R_1 = 1.5 R_2 \), so \( \frac{R_1^2}{R_2^2} = (1.5)^2 = 2.25 \).
2. **Observed Peak Wavelengths**: The observed peak wavelengths (\( \lambda_{\text{obs}} \)) are the same for both stars. Using Wien's law (\( \lambda_{\text{max}} \propto \frac{1}{T} \)), the actual rest wavelengths (\( \lambda_{\text{rest}} \)) are related by the Doppler shift due to the radial velocity of Star_2 (\( v_2 = 700 \, \text{km/s} \)).

### Doppler Shift and Temperature Correction:
For Star_2, the observed wavelength is redshifted due to its motion away from us. The Doppler shift formula for non-relativistic speeds is:

\[
\lambda_{\text{obs}} = \lambda_{\text{rest}} \left( 1 + \frac{v}{c} \right)
\]

Since \( \lambda_{\text{obs}} \) is the same for both stars:

\[
\lambda_{\text{rest,2}} = \lambda_{\text{rest,1}} \cdot \frac{1}{1 + \frac{v_2}{c}}
\]

Using \( v_2/c = \frac{700}{300,000} \approx 0.002333 \), we find:

\[
\lambda_{\text{rest,2}} \approx \lambda_{\text{rest,1}} \cdot \frac{1}{1.002333}
\]

From Wien's law (\( T \propto \frac{1}{\lambda_{\text{rest}}} \)), the temperature ratio is:

\[
T_2 = T_1 \cdot \left( 1 + \frac{v_2}{c} \right) \approx T_1 \cdot 1.002333
\]

Thus:

\[
\frac{T_2^4}{T_1^4} = \left( 1.002333 \right)^4 \approx 1.009365
\]

### Luminosity Ratio:
Substituting into the luminosity ratio formula:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{R_1^2}{R_2^2} \cdot \frac{T_1^4}{T_2^4} = 2.25 \cdot \frac{1}{1.009365}
\]

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} \approx 2.25 \cdot 0.9906 \approx 2.227
\]

### Final Answer:
The luminosity of Star_1 is approximately 2.23 times greater than that of Star_2. Among the given options, the closest value is:

**D) ~2.23**

Answer: D
