Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about finding the uncertainty ΔP_z of the operator P_z. 

First, I remember that the uncertainty in an observable is given by the square root of the variance. The formula is ΔA = sqrt(⟨A²⟩ - ⟨A⟩²), where A is the operator. So for P_z, I need to compute ⟨P_z²⟩ and ⟨P_z⟩, then take the square root of their difference.

Wait, the state of the system is given as a column vector. Let me write that down. The state vector is [-1/2; 1/sqrt(2); -1/2]. So this is a three-component vector, which probably means we're dealing with a three-level system. The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z, which makes sense because when you're working in the eigenbasis of an operator, the expectation values are simpler.

The operator P_z has a matrix form given. Let me look at it: the first row is [ħ, 0, 0], the second [0, 0, 0], and the third [0,0,-ħ]. So P_z is diagonal, which aligns with it being in its own eigenbasis. Each diagonal element is the eigenvalue for that basis vector.

So the basis vectors are |+z⟩, |0z⟩, and |-z⟩ corresponding to eigenvalues ħ, 0, and -ħ respectively. Wait, but wait—the matrix for P_z has (1,1) as ħ, (2,2) as 0, and (3,3) as -ħ. So the eigenstates are the standard basis vectors. So the state of the system is expressed in this basis.

Now, the state is given as a column vector: [-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2]. Let me compute the norm of this vector to check if it's normalized. The sum of squares: (1/4) + (1/2) + (1/4) equals (1/4 +1/4)=1/2 plus 1/2 gives 1. So yes, it's normalized. Good.

I need to compute ⟨P_z⟩, which is the expectation value of P_z in this state. Since the state is |ψ⟩ = [-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2], then ⟨ψ| P_z |ψ⟩.

But wait, P_z is diagonal, so this might be straightforward. The expectation value is the sum of each component squared multiplied by the corresponding eigenvalue. Because when you have a diagonal matrix and a state vector expressed in that basis, the expectation is just the sum of (component)^2 * eigenvalue.

So let's compute that. The components are:

First component: -1/2 → squared is (1/4). Multiply by eigenvalue ħ: (1/4) * ħ.

Second component: 1/sqrt(2) → squared is 1/2. Multiply by eigenvalue 0 → 0.

Third component: -1/2 → squared 1/4. Multiply by eigenvalue -ħ → (1/4)*(-ħ).

So adding them up: (1/4)ħ + 0 + (1/4)(-ħ) = (1/4 - 1/4)ħ = 0. So ⟨P_z⟩ is zero.

Now, I need ⟨P_z²⟩. Since P_z is diagonal, P_z squared will have each diagonal element squared. So the matrix for P_z² is [ (ħ)^2, 0, 0; 0, 0, 0; 0,0, ( -ħ )^2 ] → which is [ ħ², 0, 0; 0, 0, 0; 0, 0, ħ² ].

So, again, the expectation value of P_z squared is the sum of each component squared multiplied by the square of the eigenvalue.

So first component: (1/4) * ħ².

Second component: (1/2) * 0 = 0.

Third component: (1/4) * ħ².

Adding them: (1/4 + 1/4) ħ² = (1/2) ħ².

So ⟨P_z²⟩ is (ħ² / 2).

Now, the variance is ⟨P_z²⟩ - (⟨P_z⟩)^2 → (ħ²/2) - (0)^2 = ħ²/2.

The uncertainty ΔP_z is the square root of the variance, so sqrt(ħ²/2) = ħ / sqrt(2).

Wait, looking at the options, option B is ħ/sqrt(2). Hmm.

But wait, let me double-check the calculations. Because the state is an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ. Does that matter for the expectation values of P_z? Because P_z and P_x may not commute, but for the uncertainty, I think we're just computing the expectation values, regardless of the state's relation to other operators.

Wait, but the state is given, so I think it's correct. So the answer should be option B, ħ/sqrt(2).

To determine the uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ of the operator $P_z$, we use the formula for uncertainty:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

### Step 1: Compute $\langle P_z \rangle$
The state of the system is given as the column vector:

\[
|\psi\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{1}{2} \\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ -\frac{1}{2} \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The operator $P_z$ is diagonal with eigenvalues $\hbar$, $0$, and $-\hbar$ along the diagonal. Since the state is expressed in the eigenbasis of $P_z$, the expectation value $\langle P_z \rangle$ is computed as:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \sum_{i} |\psi_i|^2 \cdot \text{(eigenvalue of $P_z$ for basis $i$)}.
\]

The components of the state are:
- First component: $-\frac{1}{2}$, squared is $\frac{1}{4}$, multiplied by $\hbar$ gives $\frac{\hbar}{4}$.
- Second component: $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$, squared is $\frac{1}{2}$, multiplied by $0$ gives $0$.
- Third component: $-\frac{1}{2}$, squared is $\frac{1}{4}$, multiplied by $-\hbar$ gives $-\frac{\hbar}{4}$.

Adding these contributions:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{4} + 0 - \frac{\hbar}{4} = 0.
\]

### Step 2: Compute $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$
The operator $P_z^2$ is the square of $P_z$, which is also diagonal with eigenvalues $\hbar^2$, $0$, and $\hbar^2$. Using the same state, the expectation value $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$ is:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \sum_{i} |\psi_i|^2 \cdot \text{(eigenvalue of $P_z^2$ for basis $i$)}.
\]

The components of the state are:
- First component: $-\frac{1}{2}$, squared is $\frac{1}{4}$, multiplied by $\hbar^2$ gives $\frac{\hbar^2}{4}$.
- Second component: $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$, squared is $\frac{1}{2}$, multiplied by $0$ gives $0$.
- Third component: $-\frac{1}{2}$, squared is $\frac{1}{4}$, multiplied by $\hbar^2$ gives $\frac{\hbar^2}{4}$.

Adding these contributions:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{\hbar^2}{4} + 0 + \frac{\hbar^2}{4} = \frac{\hbar^2}{2}.
\]

### Step 3: Compute the Uncertainty
The variance is:

\[
\text{Variance} = \langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2 = \frac{\hbar^2}{2} - 0 = \frac{\hbar^2}{2}.
\]

The uncertainty is the square root of the variance:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar^2}{2}} = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

### Final Answer
The uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ is $\frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}$, which corresponds to option **B**.
