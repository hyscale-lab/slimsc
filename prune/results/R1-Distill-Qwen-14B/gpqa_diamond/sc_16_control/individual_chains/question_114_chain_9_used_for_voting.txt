Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question has two reactions, and I need to choose the correct reagents (A and B) from the given options. The reactions are:

1. Butan-2-one + NaCN + A → 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile
2. 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H2O) → 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid

So, I need to figure out what reagents A and B are.

Starting with the first reaction. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, which is a ketone. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, let me draw the structures.

Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. When it reacts with NaCN and a reagent A, it becomes 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me think about the structure of the product. Let's break it down: 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile would be a four-carbon chain with a hydroxyl (-OH) and a cyano (-CN) group on the second carbon, along with a methyl group. So, structure-wise, it's (CH3)C(OH)(CN)CH2-? Or maybe it's (CH2) somewhere else. Wait, but butanenitrile is four carbons. Let me see: butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN? No, wait, butane is four carbons. So nitrile is on the first carbon? Or can it be on another? But the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So that would be:

The nitrile is on the second carbon. So the structure would be CH2-C(OH)(CN)(CH3). So, more accurately, it's (CH3)2C(OH)CN. Because butanenitrile would be four carbons, so the nitrile is on C-2. Hmm.

Wait, but wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO which is a ketone. So when we add NaCN, under certain conditions, perhaps it's a nucleophilic addition. Because in ketones, nucleophilic attack can happen at the carbonyl carbon.

Wait, but NaCN as a reagent. So NaCN is a source of CN- ions. So in the presence of an acid catalyst, perhaps we can have an addition reaction. Let me think about the mechanism.

In the presence of an acid, like H3O+, which is a common catalyst for such reactions. The ketone would protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making it more electrophilic. Then, CN- would attack the carbonyl carbon. But wait, in a typical scenario, adding HCN to a ketone would give a cyanohydrin. So, the product would have the CN and OH groups on the same carbon. Wait, that's exactly what's happening here.

So, butan-2-one (a ketone) reacting with NaCN (which is providing CN-) in the presence of an acid (like H3O+ as the proton source) would form a cyanohydrin. The product would indeed be 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So that would mean that reagent A is H3O+.

Wait, but wait, the options include H3O+ as a possible A. Looking at the options:

Option A: A = H3O+, B = HCl
Option B: A = H3O+, B = CH3COOH
Option C: A = NaHSO3, B = HCl
Option D: A = NaHSO3, B = CH3COOH

So, if A is H3O+, then options A and B are possible. So that's the first part.

Now, moving on to the second reaction. The starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile, and the product is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. So, the nitrile group (CN) is being converted into a carboxylic acid (COOH) group.

Hmm, how do you convert a nitrile to a carboxylic acid? I remember that nitriles can be hydrolyzed under acidic or basic conditions. The typical conditions involve strong acid or base and heat, sometimes with H2O.

Wait, nitriles can be hydrolyzed to carboxylic acids using H2O with an acid catalyst, like HCl. Or perhaps using H3O+ as a catalyst. Alternatively, in some cases, a strong base like H2SO4 (sulfuric acid) could be used.

Wait, another thought: The first step in the hydrolysis of nitriles is typically to form an amide, then further hydrolysis to a carboxylic acid. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact conditions.

Wait, another approach: The hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids is usually done under strongly acidic or basic conditions. For example, using HCl (concentrated) and heat, or using a strong base like aqueous NaOH and heating.

Wait, but the reagent B is given as H2O, and the product is a carboxylic acid. So the reaction is hydrolysis of the nitrile group to a carboxylic acid.

So, the reagent B would be a strong acid, perhaps. Let's think: The reaction is (from nitrile to carboxylic acid) using H2O as the solvent, and the reagent B. So, for acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of nitriles, you usually use H2SO4 (sulfuric acid) as a catalyst, but sometimes HCl is used. Alternatively, under basic conditions with NaOH and H2O, you might get an acid upon acidification.

Wait, but in this case, the starting material is a nitrile with a hydroxyl group (since the molecule is 2-hydroxy-...). So, perhaps the reaction is the hydrolysis of the nitrile group. But wait, the hydroxyl is on the same carbon as the nitrile. So, maybe that's a hindered environment, but I think the hydrolysis can still proceed.

So, the second step involves the nitrile group being converted to a carboxylic acid. So, the reagent B is probably H2O with an acid catalyst. But looking at the options, the possible B reagents are HCl, CH3COOH, etc.

Wait, the question says that B is added with H2O. So the reaction is the nitrile group reacting with H2O, but with the presence of reagent B. So, B is probably an acid catalyst. So, which of the options have B as HCl or another acid?

Looking at the options:

Option A: B = HCl
Option B: B = CH3COOH (acetic acid)
Option C: B = HCl
Option D: B = CH3COOH

So, the reaction is nitrile to acid via hydrolysis. So, what conditions are needed? For nitrile hydrolysis to carboxylic acid, you can use strong acid (like HCl) with H2O and heat. Alternatively, sometimes it's done in aqueous base, but that would produce a carboxylate which is then acidified.

Wait, but in the product, it's a carboxylic acid, so if the reaction is under acidic conditions, then the work-up would already give the acid. Alternatively, under basic conditions, you'd need to add acid in the work-up.

If reagent B is HCl, that would provide the acidic conditions for the hydrolysis. So, in that case, B would be HCl.

Alternatively, if B is acetic acid (CH3COOH), that's a weaker acid. Would that be sufficient for hydrolysis of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid?

I think the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids typically requires more vigorous conditions, like concentrated HCl and heat. So perhaps HCl is the correct reagent for B.

So putting it all together.

Reagent A is H3O+ because that's the acid catalyst for the first reaction (cyanohydrin formation).

Reagent B is HCl because that's the acid catalyst for the hydrolysis of the nitrile to the carboxylic acid.

Looking at the options, option A is A=H3O+, B=HCl. So that would be the correct choice.

Wait, but let me think again. Another possibility is that reagent A is NaHSO3. Because sometimes in the formation of cyanohydrins, the conditions may require a different acid. Wait, but no, H3O+ is the usual acid catalyst. NaHSO3 would provide H+ as well, but I'm not sure if that's the case here.

Wait, but in the options, if A is NaHSO3, that would supply H+ from HSO3^- (HSO3^- is a weak acid, but when it donates a proton, it becomes SO3^2-). So, NaHSO3 is a source of H+ and SO3^2- ions.

But in the first reaction, the formation of the cyanohydrin from the ketone and CN- would require an acid catalyst. So, either H3O+ or another acid like H2SO4 or HCl can act as the catalyst.

Wait, but butan-2-one (a ketone) reacting with NaCN would require an acid to protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making it more electrophilic for CN- attack. So, H3O+ is a common choice. So, the first reaction's reagent A is H3O+.

So, the options with A as H3O+ are options A and B. Now, for B, which is the reagent for the second reaction. We determined that it's likely HCl, so looking for B to be HCl.

Looking at the options, option A has B=HCl. So, that's the correct choice.

Wait, but is there any other possibility? Let me think about the second reaction again. The starting material is a nitrile with a hydroxyl group on the same carbon. So, when nitriles hydrolyze, they typically form amides first, then acids. But in this case, the nitrile is at the same carbon as the hydroxyl. So, maybe the hydroxyl group is a stereochemical factor, but perhaps it's not relevant here.

Another thought: Could B be something else, like a base? No, the second reaction's product is a carboxylic acid, which suggests an acidic work-up. So, in the hydrolysis, if it's done under basic conditions, you might need to add acid afterward. But the question says B is added with H2O, so B is the catalyst in the reaction mixture.

So, perhaps B is HCl, which is an acid catalyst for the hydrolysis.

So, putting it all together, the correct option is A: A=H3O+, B=HCl.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves determining the suitable reagents for two reactions:

1. **Reaction 1**: Butan-2-one reacts with NaCN and reagent A to form 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile.  
   - Butan-2-one is a ketone, and NaCN provides the cyanide ion (CN⁻). The reaction involves nucleophilic addition to the carbonyl group, forming a cyanohydrin.  
   - Acid catalysis (H₃O⁺) is typically required to protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making it more electrophilic for CN⁻ attack.  
   - Therefore, reagent A is **H₃O⁺**.

2. **Reaction 2**: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacts with reagent B (in the presence of H₂O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.  
   - This reaction involves the hydrolysis of the nitrile group (CN) to a carboxylic acid (COOH).  
   - Acidic conditions are required for this transformation, and HCl is a common catalyst for such hydrolysis reactions.  
   - Therefore, reagent B is **HCl**.

From the options provided:
- **Option A**: A = H₃O⁺, B = HCl  
- **Option B**: A = H₃O⁺, B = CH₃COOH  
- **Option C**: A = NaHSO₃, B = HCl  
- **Option D**: A = NaHSO₃, B = CH₃COOH  

The correct choice is **Option A**, as it matches the determined reagents (A = H₃O⁺, B = HCl).

Answer: A
