Okay, so I've got this problem about stars and their elemental abundances. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

Alright, the question gives me two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their masses are 1.5 and 1.2 times that of the Sun, respectively. But wait, I don't think the mass directly affects the abundance ratios in this case. The problem is about elemental abundances using the EW method, which I think stands for Equivalent Width. Oh right, that's a method to determine the abundance of elements in stellar atmospheres based on spectral lines.

The given abundances are [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex and [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex. Also, [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex and [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex. Oh wait, [X/Y] notation is the logarithm of the ratio of X to Y abundances compared to the Sun. So, for example, [Fe/H] is the logarithm of (Fe/H) divided by (Fe/H)_sun. If it's 0, that means Fe/H is the same as solar. So Star_1 has solar metallicity for Fe, and Star_2 has solar metallicity for Mg.

The photospheric composition of the Sun is given too: 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 and 12 + log10(nMg/nH) = 7. Wait, the 12 is part of the equation? Let me parse that. So for Fe, 12 + log(nFe/nH) =7.5 → log(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5. So nFe/nH is 10^(-4.5). Similarly, nMg/nH is 10^(-5) because 12 + log(nMg/nH) =7 → log= -5 → 10^-5.

Our goal is to find the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So, [nSi_1 / nSi_2].

Let me think about each star.

First, Star_1: [Si/Fe]_1 is 0.3. Since [Fe/H]_1 is 0, that means Fe abundance is same as Sun. So [Fe/H]_1 = 0 → Fe abundance relative to H is same as Sun. So nFe_1 / nH_1 = nFe_sun / nH_sun.

Wait, but the problem says that the Sun's composition is given. So for Star_1, [Fe/H]=0 → [Fe/H] = log(Fe/H) - log(Fe/H_sun) = 0. Therefore, Fe/H ratio is 1. So same as Sun.

So, for Star_1, [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3. [X/Y] is log(Si/Fe) - log(Si/Fe)_sun. So log(Si/Fe)_1 = 0.3 + log(Si/Fe)_sun.

But wait, [Si/Fe]_sun is [log(Si/Fe)_sun] = (log(nSi/nH) - log(nFe/nH)) - (same for Sun). Wait, no, let's think in terms of the Sun's values.

Wait, the Sun's nFe/nH is 10^(-4.5) as calculated earlier. Similarly, let's find nSi/nH for the Sun.

Wait, the Sun's composition isn't given for Si. Hmm. That might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps we can compute [Si/Fe] for the Sun and then use that.

Wait, another approach: for Star_1, [Fe/H]=0, so Fe is solar. [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3. So Si abundance relative to Fe is higher than Sun by 0.3 dex.

Wait, let me think in terms of the logarithmic ratios.

The formula for [X/Y] is log(X/Y) - log(X/Y)_sun. So [X/Y] = log(X/Y) - log(X/Y)_sun.

So for Star_1: [Si/Fe]_1 = log(Si/Fe)_1 - log(Si/Fe)_sun = 0.3.

Therefore, log(Si/Fe)_1 = 0.3 + log(Si/Fe)_sun.

But we don't know log(Si/Fe)_sun. Hmm.

Wait, but the Sun's composition is given for Fe and Mg. How can I find Si?

Hmm, perhaps we can find it using the solar Mg/Si ratio?

Wait, I don't have that. Oh wait, the given for Star_2 is [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3. So Star_2's Mg/Si ratio is 0.3 dex higher than solar. And [Mg/H]_2 is 0, so Mg is solar.

Wait, let me try to compute the solar ratios first.

For the Sun:

nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5) → as computed.

nMg/nH = 10^(-5).

We don't have nSi/nH for the Sun, but perhaps we can compute [Mg/Si]_sun as log(Mg/Si)_sun.

Wait, [Mg/Si]_sun is log( (nMg/nH) / (nSi/nH) ) = log(nMg/nSi) = log( (nMg/nH) / (nSi/nH) ) = log( (nMg/nSi) ), so it's log(nMg/nSi).

So, for the Sun, [Mg/Si]_sun = log( (10^-5) / (nSi/nH) ) = log( (10^-5) / (nSi/nH) ).

Wait, but without knowing nSi/nH, I can't compute this. So perhaps I need to find [Mg/Si]_sun from other data.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express [Mg/Si]_2 in terms of [Mg/Si]_sun.

Wait, let's think about Star_2.

Star_2 has [Mg/H]_2 = 0 → Mg/H is solar. So nMg_2/nH_2 = nMg_sun / nH_sun.

[Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 → [Mg/Si]_2 = log( (nMg_2 / nSi_2) / (nMg_sun / nSi_sun) ) ) = 0.3.

So, nMg_2 / nSi_2 = (nMg_sun / nSi_sun) × 10^0.3.

But since nMg_2 = nMg_sun (because [Mg/H]=0), so:

nMg_sun / nSi_2 = (nMg_sun / nSi_sun) × 10^0.3.

Dividing both sides by nMg_sun, we get:

1 / nSi_2 = (1 / nSi_sun) × 10^0.3 → nSi_2 = nSi_sun / (10^0.3).

So, nSi_2 = nSi_sun × 10^(-0.3).

Wait, that's for Star_2. Now, let's go back to Star_1.

Star_1 has [Fe/H]_1=0 → nFe_1 = nFe_sun.

[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → log( (nSi_1 / nFe_1) / (nSi_sun / nFe_sun) ) ) = 0.3.

Since nFe_1 = nFe_sun, this simplifies to log( nSi_1 / nSi_sun ) = 0.3 → nSi_1 = nSi_sun × 10^0.3.

So, nSi_1 = 10^0.3 × nSi_sun.

And nSi_2 = 10^(-0.3) × nSi_sun.

So the ratio (nSi_1)/(nSi_2) = [10^0.3 × nSi_sun ] / [10^-0.3 × nSi_sun ] = 10^(0.3 + 0.3) = 10^0.6.

Calculating 10^0.6: since 10^0.6 ≈ 3.98, which is approximately 4.

Wait, but wait, that's the ratio of Si in Star_1 to Star_2.

But let me double-check. For Star_1, [Si/Fe]=0.3, so Si is higher than Fe by that ratio. Wait, but wait, since [Fe/H] is 0, Fe is same as Sun. So Si is 10^0.3 times solar Si.

Similarly, for Star_2, [Mg/Si]=0.3, but [Mg/H] is 0, meaning Mg is same as Sun. So the ratio [Mg/Si] is 0.3 above solar. So [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 → [Mg/Si]_2 = log( (Mg/Si)_2 ) - log( (Mg/Si)_sun ) = 0.3.

Which means (Mg/Si)_2 = (Mg/Si)_sun × 10^0.3.

But since (Mg/Si)_sun = (nMg_sun /nH_sun ) / (nSi_sun /nH_sun ) ) = nMg_sun /nSi_sun.

So (Mg/Si)_2 = (nMg_sun /nSi_sun ) ×10^0.3 → Rearranged, nSi_2 = nMg_sun / ( (nMg_sun /nSi_sun ) ×10^0.3 ) ) → simplifies to nSi_2 = nSi_sun / 10^0.3.

So yes, nSi_2 = nSi_sun ×10^(-0.3).

So the ratio nSi_1/nSi_2 = (10^0.3) / (10^-0.3) ) = 10^0.6 ≈3.98, which is about 4.

Looking at the options, option A is ~3.9, which would be approximately this.

So the answer should be A) ~3.9.

To determine the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2, we analyze the given elemental abundances and use the logarithmic abundance notation [X/Y] = log(X/Y) - log(X/Y)_sun. The Sun's photospheric composition is provided as:

- \( 12 + \log_{10}(n_{\text{Fe}}/n_{\text{H}}) = 7.5 \) → \( \log_{10}(n_{\text{Fe}}/n_{\text{H}}) = -4.5 \), so \( n_{\text{Fe}}/n_{\text{H}} = 10^{-4.5} \).
- \( 12 + \log_{10}(n_{\text{Mg}}/n_{\text{H}}) = 7 \) → \( \log_{10}(n_{\text{Mg}}/n_{\text{H}}) = -5 \), so \( n_{\text{Mg}}/n_{\text{H}} = 10^{-5} \).

### For Star_1:
- \([Fe/H]_1 = 0\) → \( n_{\text{Fe}}/n_{\text{H}} = n_{\text{Fe, sun}}/n_{\text{H, sun}} \), meaning Fe abundance is solar.
- \([Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3\) → \( \log_{10}(n_{\text{Si}}/n_{\text{Fe}}) - \log_{10}(n_{\text{Si, sun}}/n_{\text{Fe, sun}}) = 0.3 \).
- This simplifies to \( \log_{10}(n_{\text{Si}}/n_{\text{Si, sun}}) = 0.3 \), so \( n_{\text{Si}}/n_{\text{Si, sun}} = 10^{0.3} \).
- Thus, \( n_{\text{Si, 1}} = n_{\text{Si, sun}} \times 10^{0.3} \).

### For Star_2:
- \([Mg/H]_2 = 0\) → \( n_{\text{Mg}}/n_{\text{H}} = n_{\text{Mg, sun}}/n_{\text{H, sun}} \), meaning Mg abundance is solar.
- \([Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3\) → \( \log_{10}(n_{\text{Mg}}/n_{\text{Si}}) - \log_{10}(n_{\text{Mg, sun}}/n_{\text{Si, sun}}) = 0.3 \).
- This simplifies to \( \log_{10}(n_{\text{Mg}}/n_{\text{Si}}) = \log_{10}(n_{\text{Mg, sun}}/n_{\text{Si, sun}}) + 0.3 \).
- Rearranging, \( n_{\text{Si}}/n_{\text{Si, sun}} = 10^{-0.3} \).
- Thus, \( n_{\text{Si, 2}} = n_{\text{Si, sun}} \times 10^{-0.3} \).

### Ratio of Silicon Atoms:
The ratio of silicon atoms is:
\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si, 1}}}{n_{\text{Si, 2}}} = \frac{n_{\text{Si, sun}} \times 10^{0.3}}{n_{\text{Si, sun}} \times 10^{-0.3}} = 10^{0.3 + 0.3} = 10^{0.6}.
\]
Approximating \( 10^{0.6} \), we find \( 10^{0.6} \approx 3.98 \), which is approximately 4.

### Final Answer:
The ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2 is approximately **3.9**.
