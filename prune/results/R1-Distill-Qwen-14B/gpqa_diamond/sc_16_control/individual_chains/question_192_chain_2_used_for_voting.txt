Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric fields and conductors. Hmm, let's see what it says. Alright, the setup is an uncharged spherical conductor with a small cavity inside. The cavity's center is a distance s away from the center of the conductor. The radius of the cavity is r, which is smaller than R, the conductor's radius. 

Then, a small positive charge +q is placed inside the cavity. The question is asking about the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is at a distance L from the conductor's center, and its distance from the cavity's center is l. Oh, and l and L are both greater than R. Also, there's an angle theta between l and s, which I think is the line from the conductor's center to the cavity's center.

Wait, so the conductor was initially uncharged, but it has this cavity with a charge inside. I remember something about conductors and charges. I think when a charge is inside a conducting cavity, it induces charges on the inner and outer surfaces. But wait, the conductor itself was uncharged, right? So the total charge on the conductor must be zero. 

So, the charge +q in the cavity would induce a charge -q on the inner surface of the conductor. But since the conductor is neutral overall, the outer surface must have a charge +q. Because the total conductor's charge is zero, but the inner is -q, so the outer must be +q to balance it out. 

Now, the question is about the electric field at point P, which is outside the conductor. Since P is outside, the electric field should be due to the outer charges only. Because the inner charges are enclosed and their fields inside the conductor would cancel, but outside, only the outer charges contribute.

Wait, but the point P is outside the conductor, so the conductor's charges (the outer +q) would produce a field as if all the charge were concentrated at the center, right? Because for a conducting shell, the charges on the outer surface can be treated as being at the center when considering points outside the shell.

But wait, the conductor's outer surface has charge +q. So the field at P should be the same as if the charge +q were at the center of the conductor. So E would be (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L². Because the formula for the electric field of a point charge is E = kq / r², where r is the distance from the charge.

But let me think again. The conductor's outer surface has charge +q, and the point P is outside. So the field is due to the outer charge, which is distributed on the outer surface. But from the outside, the field is the same as if all the charge were at the center. So the field at P is E = (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L².

Looking at the options, option B is E = (1/(4πε₀)) q / L². Option D is similar, but with l squared.

Wait, but why isn't it considering the position of the cavity's charge? Because the charges on the inner surface are induced by the +q, but they are inside the conductor, so for points outside the conductor, their fields don't contribute because they are screened. Only the outer charges (+q) contribute to the external field.

So the field at P is as if the charge +q is at the center of the conductor. So the magnitude is based on L, the distance from the center of the conductor to P.

But wait, what about the angle theta and the distance l? The point P is at a distance l from the cavity's center, with the angle theta between s and l. Hmm, would that affect the field? Let me think.

Wait, the field due to the outer charge is radial from the conductor's center. Point P is at a distance L from the center. So the electric field's magnitude depends only on L, not on how the point is positioned relative to the cavity's center. Because the outer charges are on the spherical surface, and the field outside depends only on the distance from the center. So the other variables like l and theta don't come into play here.

So the correct formula is option B. 

Wait, but why would the options have other choices? Let me quickly think again. Is there any situation where the position of the cavity's charge affects the external field? No, because the conductor's outer surface is at a higher potential, and the charges there are free to move. So the presence of the cavity's charge only affects the inner surface, not the outer. 

Therefore, the electric field outside the conductor is the same as if all the outer charge were at the center, regardless of where the inner charge is located. So the answer should be option B.

The problem involves an uncharged spherical conductor with a small cavity containing a charge $+q$. The conductor has an outer radius $R$, and the cavity's center is at a distance $s$ from the conductor's center. A point $P$ outside the conductor is at a distance $L$ from the conductor's center and a distance $l$ from the cavity's center, with an angle $\theta$ between $l$ and $s$. The goal is to determine the electric field $\vec{E}$ at point $P$.

When a charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity, it induces a charge $-q$ on the inner surface of the conductor. Since the conductor is neutral overall, the outer surface must have a charge $+q$ to balance the induced charge. For points outside the conductor, the electric field is due only to the charges on the outer surface, as the inner charges are screened.

The electric field outside a spherical conductor is determined by the total charge on the outer surface and the distance from the center of the conductor. Since the outer surface has a charge $+q$, the electric field at point $P$ is given by:

\[
E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}
\]

This result is independent of the position of the cavity or the angle $\theta$, as the outer charges on the conductor produce a field that depends only on the distance $L$ from the conductor's center. 

Analyzing the options:
- **Option A** and **Option C** involve terms like $(l \pm s \cos\theta)^2$, which are irrelevant for the electric field outside the conductor.
- **Option D** uses $l^2$ instead of $L^2$, which is incorrect because the field depends on the distance from the conductor's center, not the cavity's center.
- **Option B** correctly uses $L^2$ in the denominator, matching the derived expression.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: B**
