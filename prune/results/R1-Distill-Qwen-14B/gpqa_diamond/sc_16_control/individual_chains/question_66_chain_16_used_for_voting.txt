Okay, so I have this question about the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) and the symmetries that operators must respect. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The question is asking which symmetries all operators in SMEFT must respect. The options are Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry. The possible answers are combinations of these four.

First, I need to remember what each of these symmetries entails. Lorentz symmetry has to do with the invariance of the laws of physics under Lorentz transformations, which include rotations and boosts. Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations, so it's the full symmetry of Minkowski spacetime. Then there's CP symmetry, which combines charge conjugation (C) and parity (P). CPT symmetry combines charge, parity, and time reversal.

In the SMEFT, the idea is that we write down all possible operators that are consistent with the symmetries of the Standard Model, but without assuming a specific high-energy theory. So what symmetries are part of the Standard Model? The Standard Model has Lorentz symmetry, gauge symmetry (like SU(2) and SU(3)), and it also respects CPT symmetry. But does it respect CP symmetry? Well, the Standard Model isn't CP symmetric because of the way the Higgs potential is treated and the presence of certain terms like the CKM matrix which allow for CP violation. So the Standard Model doesn't have CP symmetry as a fundamental symmetry.

Wait, but when building SMEFT, do the operators need to respect all the symmetries of the Standard Model? Or are they just required to respect some subset? From what I recall, SMEFT respects the symmetries of the Standard Model, so any operator added must preserve those symmetries.

So let's go through each point. Do all operators in SMEFT respect Lorentz symmetry? I think so. Because the SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant effective theory. Operators are constructed as Lorentz scalars. So yes, Lorentz symmetry (option 1) must be respected.

Next, Poincare symmetry. Wait, Poincare includes translations as well. But in effective field theories, we usually consider operators up to a certain scale, and the theory is defined in a way that respects the Poincare group. But I'm not entirely sure if all operators in SMEFT must respect Poincare symmetry. Alternatively, maybe they don't need to, because Poincare includes translations, but in SMEFT, you can have terms involving derivatives. Hmm, wait, no. I think that SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory, which implies Poincare symmetry because it's built on top of a Lorentz symmetric spacetime. Or maybe not. Because the Poincare group includes both Lorentz transformations and translations. But in a field theory, the Poincare symmetry is automatically part of the framework. So perhaps the SMEFT operators must respect Poincare, but I'm a bit confused here. Alternatively, maybe only Lorentz symmetry is required because Poincare includes translations, and the SMEFT's operators can have momentum dependence. Wait, maybe Poincare symmetry is automatically a part of the framework because the fields transform covariantly, but I'm not entirely certain. Maybe operators need to respect Lorentz and Poincare. Or perhaps Poincare isn't a condition because it's already part of the setup. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, I think that Poincare symmetry is more about the spacetime structure of the theory. Since SMEFT is formulated in a Minkowski spacetime, which is Poincare symmetric, but whether each individual operator must respect Poincare symmetry... Hmm, perhaps not. Because each operator is a local Lorentz scalar, but they don't have to transform in a way that includes translations. Or maybe they do because all terms in the Lagrangian must be Poincare-invariant. So the operators must form a Poincare-invariant Lagrangian. So maybe the operators themselves are Poincare scalars, which would imply that option 2 (Poincare) is also a symmetry that's respected. So 1 and 2 are both correct.

Now, about CP symmetry. Since the Standard Model doesn't have CP symmetry, the SMEFT doesn't require operators to respect it. Because in SMEFT, you can have operators that violate CP, as long as they are allowed by the Standard Model's symmetry. Wait, but the question is which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So if the Standard Model doesn't have CP symmetry as a fundamental symmetry, then the SMEFT operators don't need to respect it. So option 3 is not a required symmetry. Thus, operators don't have to preserve CP.

CPT symmetry, on the other hand, is a fundamental symmetry in quantum field theory. The Standard Model respects CPT symmetry, so SMEFT operators must respect it as well. Because CPT is a combination of symmetries that must hold in any Lorentz-invariant QFT. So option 4 (CPT) must be respected by all SMEFT operators.

Putting it all together: which options must be respected by all operators?

1. Lorentz Symmetry: Yes
2. Poincare symmetry: Hmm, maybe yes. Because all operators are part of a Poincare-invariant theory. But I'm not 100% sure. Let me think. The SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory, which is part of the Poincare symmetry. So all operators must be Lorentz scalars, which would imply they're Poincare scalars as well. So operator terms must be Poincare-invariant. So 2 is also required.

Wait, but wait. Poincare symmetry includes translations. Do SMEFT operators have to be invariant under translations? Because when you have operators in the Lagrangian, they are local, so their form is invariant under translations. For example, a term like (∂μ φ)^2 would be translation invariant because derivatives are covariant. So yes, all operators in the Lagrangian are translation-invariant. So operators must respect Poincare symmetry as well. So options 1 and 2 are both correct.

So the symmetries are 1,2,4.

Wait, but the options are 1,2; 3,4; 1,2,4; 1,3,4.

Looking at the choices:

Option C is 1,2,4. So that would be Lorentz, Poincare, and CPT.

But wait, I thought about Poincare and Lorentz. Since Poincare includes Lorentz, but I'm not sure if the question treats them as separate.

Wait, the question separates Lorentz and Poincare as two options (1 and 2). So do SMEFT operators respect both Lorentz and Poincare symmetry?

But if Poincare is a larger symmetry, including Lorentz and translations, then if the operators respect Poincare, they automatically respect Lorentz. But the question lists both as separate options, so perhaps an operator must respect both. But perhaps in the SMEFT, the operators are required to respect Lorentz symmetry, but not necessarily Poincare because the SMEFT itself is considered in a Poincare-invariant framework. Or maybe operators are required to be Lorentz scalars, which would automatically make them Poincare scalars as well. I'm a bit confused.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that Poincare symmetry includes momentum translation. So an operator like (∂μ φ) would transform in a way that respects Poincare, but perhaps each term in the Lagrangian must be a scalar under Poincare. But I'm not 100% certain. Alternatively, perhaps the question treats Lorentz and Poincare as separate, but in reality, the SMEFT requires Lorentz invariance, which is a subset of Poincare.

Wait, another approach: which of these symmetries are part of the Standard Model that SMEFT extends.

The Standard Model respects Lorentz symmetry, gauge symmetry, and CPT, but not CP. So SMEFT operators must respect the same symmetries as the SM. So SMEFT operators must respect Lorentz symmetry (1) and CPT (4), but not CP (3). What about Poincare? The SM is formulated in a Poincare-invariant spacetime, but in the framework of SMEFT, are the operators required to respect Poincare? Because the SMEFT is built on top of a Poincare-invariant theory, but individual operators are Lorentz scalars, which also implies they're Poincare scalars. So the operators must respect both Lorentz and Poincare symmetry. But wait, in the SM, the Lagrangian is Poincare-invariant, but each term in the Lagrangian is a Poincare scalar. So SMEFT operators must respect Poincare as well.

So that would mean that options 1,2,4 are correct. So looking at the options, option C is 1,2,4.

But wait, I thought that Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz, so if you have operators that are Lorentz scalars, do they automatically respect Poincare? Not necessarily. Because Poincare includes translations as well. So an operator could be a Lorentz scalar but not a Poincare scalar? I'm not sure. For example, a term like ∂μ φ ∂^μ φ is a Lorentz scalar and a Poincare scalar. Because under translations, the fields transform, but the derivatives have terms that cancel that. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the SMEFT doesn't require the operators to respect Poincare symmetry beyond Lorentz and gauge. But I think that all operators must respect Lorentz and Poincare, because the theory is built in a Poincare-invariant framework.

Wait, but Poincare symmetry is more about the spacetime structure. The SMEFT includes all possible Poincare-invariant operators. So any operator in the SMEFT must be a Poincare scalar. So yes, Poincare must be respected.

Therefore, the correct symmetries are 1,2, and 4. So the correct option is C.

To determine which symmetries must be respected by all operators in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT), we analyze the symmetries listed in the question:

1. **Lorentz Symmetry**: SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant effective field theory, meaning all operators must be Lorentz scalars. This symmetry is fundamental to the framework, so all operators respect Lorentz symmetry.

2. **Poincaré Symmetry**: Poincaré symmetry includes both Lorentz symmetry and translational symmetry. Since SMEFT is formulated in a Minkowski spacetime and all operators in the Lagrangian are local and translation-invariant, Poincaré symmetry is also respected by all operators.

3. **CP Symmetry**: The Standard Model does not respect CP symmetry, and SMEFT extends the Standard Model without requiring operators to preserve CP symmetry. Therefore, CP symmetry is not a necessary symmetry for SMEFT operators.

4. **CPT Symmetry**: CPT symmetry is a fundamental symmetry in quantum field theory and is respected by the Standard Model. Since SMEFT extends the Standard Model, all operators in SMEFT must also respect CPT symmetry.

From this analysis, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincaré symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4). Therefore, the correct option is:

**Answer: C**
