Okay, so I've got this pretty complex chemistry problem here. Let me try to break it down step by step. Hmm, the question involves several reactions and some properties of substances involved. I'll start by reading through the question carefully and jotting down the key points.

So, the problem is about Substance X reacting with liquid Y. The reaction releases a gas W, and a precipitate G forms. When G is heated, it releases B. The melting point of B is close to 277 K. Another clue is that a keto acid reacts with X to produce a product with two oxygen atoms. Also, X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, and it has a heavier isotope of one of its elements. 

Let me think about each part. First, what could Substance X be? Since it's used as a reagent in organic chemistry, maybe it's something like a strong base or a reagent that's commonly used. One possibility comes to mind: sodium or potassium. Wait, but wait, the mention of a heavier isotope makes me think that perhaps the element in X has a common isotope that's heavier. For example, sulfur has different isotopes, but maybe more likely something like chlorine or another element with multiple isotopes.

Wait, another angle: when X reacts with a liquid, perhaps it's a reaction like a Grignard reagent. Grignard reagents are organomagnesium compounds, like CH2MgBr. But I'm not sure if this connects yet.

Alternatively, maybe X is an alkali metal because they react violently with certain liquids, like water. Let's think: for example, sodium metal reacts with water to produce hydrogen gas (could that be gas W?), sodium hydroxide, and maybe some precipitate? Or perhaps potassium?

But wait, the gas W has a molecule with the same number of neutrons and protons. Let's think about possible gases. Hydrogen gas is H2. Each H atom has 1 proton and 0 neutrons. So H2 has 2 protons and 0 neutrons. That's not equal. What about another gas? Oxygen is O2—each O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons, so O2 has 16 of each. So number of protons and neutrons in the molecule would be 16 each. That fits. So W is O2. Or maybe is it another diatomic gas like Cl2? Chlorine has 17 protons and 18 neutrons usually. Wait, but each Cl atom has 17 p and 18 n. So Cl2 would have 34 p and 36 n. Not equal. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, wait. Let's think about the gas W. The number of protons and neutrons in each molecule are the same. So let's calculate for some gases:

- H2: 2 protons, 0 neutrons. Not equal.
- O2: 16 protons (each O is 8), 16 neutrons (each O is 8). 16 each. So yes, 16 protons and 16 neutrons. So that would work.
- N2: 14 protons (each N has 7), 14 neutrons (each N has 7). So 14 each. That's another possibility.
- F2: Each F has 9 protons and 10 neutrons (common isotope is 19F). So F2 would have 18 protons and 20 neutrons. Not equal.
- Cl2: 34 protons, 36 neutrons. No.
- So O2 and N2 are possibilities. Let's see if any other clues can help.

The reaction is violent, so maybe a metal reacting with water to produce H2 gas. But if W is H2, then the protons and neutrons wouldn't add up. So maybe O2 isn't the gas, but perhaps another possibility.

Wait, the reaction of a metal with water produces H2. For example, 2 Na + 2 H2O → 2 NaOH + H2↑. In this case, W would be H2. Each H has 1 p and 0 n, so H2 has 2 protons and 0 neutrons. That's not equal, so H2 doesn't fit the W condition.

Hmm, maybe the reaction isn't with water. What other liquids react violently with metals? Perhaps something like liquid nitrogen? No, that's a gas. Or maybe an acid?

Wait, another thought: If X is a metal, and Y is an acid. For example, magnesium reacts with hydrochloric acid to produce H2 gas. But again, W would be H2, which doesn't fit the neutron and proton count.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a solution containing something else. Let me think about another angle. The precipitate G formed, when heated, releases B. And B's melting point is close to 277 K. Let's see: 277 K is about 4 degrees Celsius. What compounds have a melting point near that? Perhaps something like ammonium chloride? No, that's lower. Wait, 277 K is 4°C. So B is a solid at that temperature. What solidifies near that temperature? Maybe something like water freezes at 273 K, but that's close. Wait, B's melting point is about 277 K, so its freezing point is the same. Assuming it's a pure substance, perhaps it's a different compound. Wait, maybe B is ammonium nitrate? No, its melting point is higher, around 169°C. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe B is sodium carbonate? No, that's higher. Wait, maybe it's something else. If G, when heated, releases B, perhaps G is a carbonate or hydroxide that decomposes upon heating.

Wait, perhaps the precipitate G is a sulfide or carbonate. For example, if X is a metal reacting with a sulfide solution, but that might not fit.

Wait, going back to the product of a keto acid with X. The product has two oxygen atoms. A keto acid has a ketone group and a carboxylic acid group. When a keto acid reacts with X (which I'm starting to think is a metal), perhaps it's a Grignard reagent or an organometallic. Alternatively, maybe X is a base that deprotonates the keto acid.

Wait, a keto acid is something like a beta-keto acid, which can undergo decarboxylation. But not sure how that connects yet.

Another approach: The problem mentions that X incorporates a heavier isotope. So, one of the elements in X has a heavier isotope. Elements with common heavier isotopes include chlorine (Cl-35 and Cl-37), sulfur (various isotopes), or bromine (Br-79 and Br-81). So X probably contains one of these elements.

Wait, perhaps X is something like NaOH (sodium hydroxide). Sodium has isotopes, but the heavier ones are rare. Alternatively, sulfur is in something like H2SO4, but not sure.

Wait, another thought: the precipitate G when heated releases B. Suppose G is a metal hydroxide that dehydrates upon heating. For example, heating copper hydroxide produces copper oxide and water. But then B would be the oxide, but that doesn't directly link to the melting point.

Alternatively, G could be a carbonate that decomposes into CO2 and the metal oxide. For example, heating Na2CO3 gives Na2O and CO2. But again, not sure.

Wait, the melting point of B is close to 277 K. Let me convert 277 K to Celsius: 277 - 273 = 4°C. So B is a solid that melts at around 4°C, which is just above 0. What substance has a melting point around 4°C? Well, water freezes at 0°C, but maybe another compound. Wait, ammonium nitrate has a melting point of about 169°C, so that's not it. Maybe something like sodium nitrate? Let me check: Sodium nitrate's melting point is around 327°C. Hmm, not matching.

Wait, another possibility: B is ammonium chloride. Its melting point is around 337°C. No, that's way higher. Hmm. Maybe it's something else. I'm a bit stuck here.

Wait, what about melting points of other compounds. For example, maybe B is something like urea. Urea's melting point is around 135°C. No. What else? Perhaps B is a hydrate. For example, sodium carbonate decahydrate (Na2CO3·10H2O) has a melting point of about 27°C. But that's higher than 4°C. Wait, but the problem says B's melting point is very close to 277 K, which is 4°C. So perhaps B is a different hydrate. Wait, maybe something like sodium acetate trihydrate? I think its melting point is around 58°C. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe B is a different compound. Let me think of another approach. What about if B is solid CO2 (dry ice)? No, because its melting point is way below 0°C. Alternatively, perhaps B is a metal that's solid at room temp but has a low melting point. For example, mercury has a melting point of -39°C, which is too low. Lead's is 327°C. Maybe another metalloid? Or perhaps B is an oxide. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps B is a different compound. Let's think about the precipitate G. When G is heated, it releases B. So perhaps G is a carbonate or a sulfite that decomposes upon heating.

Wait, another angle: the product when a keto acid reacts with X has two oxygen atoms. Let's say the keto acid is something like acetoacetic acid (β-keto acid). If X is a base like NaOH, then the reaction would deprotonate the keto acid. The product would be the conjugate base. But how does that relate to two oxygen atoms? Not sure.

Alternatively, if X is a metal, perhaps the reaction forms a carboxylate salt. For example, the keto acid (like CH3COCH2COOH) reacting with X (like NaOH) would form a sodium salt, like CH3COCH2COO^- Na^+. But I'm not seeing a direct connection to two oxygen atoms in the product.

Wait, perhaps the product is a ketone. No, the reaction probably doesn't form a ketone. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a substitution where the keto acid loses CO2, leading to a product with two oxygen atoms. For example, in decarboxylation reactions, a keto acid may lose CO2 to form a ketone. So the product would be a ketone, which has one O. Wait, but the question says the product has two O atoms. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the product is a hemiacetal or something else. I'm not entirely sure about this part.

Let's get back to the initial reaction. X reacts with Y, which is a liquid, to produce gas W, precipitate G. The properties of W: same number of protons and neutrons in the molecule. So possibilities are O2, N2, maybe CO2? Let's see.

Wait, CO2 has 22 protons (12 from C, 16 from O2) and 22 neutrons (13 in C, 16 in each O). Wait, no. Carbon has 6 protons and 6 neutrons (in ^12C), and oxygen has 8 protons and 8 neutrons. So CO2 would have 6 + 16 = 22 protons and 6 + 16 = 22 neutrons. Oh, so CO2 also fits. So W could be CO2. But that's if each molecule has 22 each. But wait, each CO2 molecule has 6 (from C) + 16 (from O2) = 22 protons and 6 (from C) + 16 (from O2) = 22 neutrons. So yes, 22 each. That's another possibility.

So W could be CO2. If that's the case, then what reaction produces CO2 gas? Perhaps a carbonate reacting with an acid. But that might not fit.

Alternatively, if Y is a carbonate, but I'm not sure. Let me think: if X is a metal (like Mg) and Y is a carbonate solution, then the reaction would produce CO2 gas, a precipitate (maybe the metal hydroxide if the carbonate is soluble?), but I'm not exactly sure.

Wait, but if X is a metal and Y is a carbonate solution, the reaction would be: M + CO3^2- → MCO3? But I'm not certain about that. Alternatively, perhaps Y is a carbonate, and when X reacts, it displaces CO2.

Wait, another possibility: Y is a solution of sodium carbonate. If X is Mg metal, the reaction would perhaps produce MgCO3 and release CO2. But MgCO3 is not very soluble and might precipitate. But I'm not sure if that's the case.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a solution of a sulfide. If X is a metal, it might displace H2S gas. But H2S has 2 H (each with 1 p, 0 n) and 2 S (each with 16 p and 32 n). So total protons would be 2, neutrons 64. Not equal. So H2S doesn't fit.

Wait, let me list possible W gases again:

- O2: 16 p, 16 n.
- N2: 14 p, 14 n.
- CO2: 22 p, 22 n.
- Cl2: 34 p, 36 n. Doesn't fit.
- Others? Maybe CH4? No, 6 p, 8 n. No.

So W is likely O2, N2, or CO2.

If W is O2, perhaps the reaction is between a metal and water, but that would produce H2. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is between a metal (like sodium) and a liquid such as liquid nitrogen or something else. Not sure.

Wait, another angle: The precipitate G, when heated, releases B. So perhaps G is a carbonate which, upon heating, decomposes into CO2 and a metal oxide. But then B would be CO2, which is a gas, not a precipitate. Hmm, maybe not.

Alternatively, G could be a hydroxide that, upon heating, loses water to form an oxide. For example, Cu(OH)2 → CuO + H2O. But then B would be CuO, a solid. The melting point of copper oxide is around 2260°C (for CuO, which is much higher than 277 K). So that doesn't fit.

Hmm. Maybe G is a different kind of compound. Let's think about what has a melting point around 4°C. Wait, maybe B is a different compound, like ammonium thiocyanate? I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps B is something like sodium acetate, which can crystallize and have a melting point around 324°C. No, that's way too high.

Wait, perhaps B isn't a pure element but a compound. If B is sodium carbonate, the melting point is around 850°C. Hmm. Not helpful.

Alternatively, maybe B is a hydrate. For example, calcium chloride hexahydrate has a melting point of about 22°C. Close to 277 K (4°C), but not exactly. Wait, 22°C is 295 K, which is a bit higher than 277 K.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's try to think of each part again.

First, X is a reagent in organic chemistry. Common reagents are things like NaOH, KOH, maybe Grignard reagents, etc. Grignard reagents are organometallic, like CH2MgBr. But in that case, X would be something like Mg. Alternatively, maybe X is something like LiAlH4, but that's more for reductions.

Wait, another possibility: X is a heavy metal like lead or something else. But I'm not sure.

Wait, the product of a keto acid with X has two oxygen atoms. Let's imagine the keto acid is something like acetoacetic acid (CH3COCH2COOH). If X is a base, like NaOH, then the product would be the sodium salt of the keto acid. That would have more oxygen atoms than the acid itself, but I'm not sure how that leads to a product with two oxygen atoms.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a decarboxylation. When a keto acid loses CO2, it becomes a ketone. So the product would be a ketone, which has one oxygen. But the question says two oxygen atoms. Hmm, that's confusing.

Wait, perhaps the product is a diketone? Or maybe an ester? Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe X is a strong oxidizing agent. But I'm not making progress here.

Let me think about another angle. The cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X. So perhaps X is a compound with two different elements. For instance, NaOH has Na, O, H. The lightest is H (1), heaviest is Na (23) but wait, if it's NaOH, then the elements are Na (23), O (16), H (1). So the lightest is H (1), heaviest Na (23). Their sum is 24. But that's not one of the options. Wait, the options are 35, 25, 31, 29.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a compound like KMnO4, but that's a lot of elements.

Wait, another thought: X could be a diatomic molecule with two different isotopes. Wait, but the question says X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. So, for example, if X is HCl, where Cl has isotopes like Cl-35 and Cl-37. So in that case, one of the elements (Cl) has a heavier isotope in X.

But if X is HCl, what would its reaction look like? HCl is a liquid? At room temp, HCl is a gas, but perhaps under certain conditions it can be a liquid. So when HCl reacts with something, maybe it's reacting with a metal. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: X is a halogen, like Cl2. But Cl2 is a diatomic gas, not a liquid, I think. Maybe X is something else.

Hmm, maybe I should look for the answer by considering the possible options. The question asks for the sum of the lightest and heaviest elements in X. The options are 35, 25, 31, 29.

So possible pairs that sum to one of these numbers. Let's think:

Option 29: Possible pairs could be 1 (H) + 28 (Si?) No, because 28 is not an atomic mass. Wait, possible combinations:

- 1 (H) + 28 (Si?) No.

Wait, perhaps the elements are O (16) and Cl (35.5). 16 + 35.5 is 51.5, which isn't an option.

Another possibility: if X contains C and O. C is 12, O is 16. Sum would be 28. But 28 isn't an option. Hmm.

Wait, Option D is 29. Let's see, could it be 1 + 28? No, because 28 is not an element. 3 + 26? 3 is Li, 26 is Fe. But that's a stretch.

Wait, perhaps the elements are O (16) and Na (23). 16 + 23 = 39. Not an option.

Wait another angle: the lightest element is hydrogen (1), and the heaviest could be something else. If their sum is 29, the heaviest would be 28. But 28 is not an element. Alternatively, maybe the lightest is H (1), heaviest is Cl (35.5). 1 + 35.5 = 36.5, which isn't an option. But if we take whole numbers, maybe 1 + 35 (approx Cl) =36, which isn't an option.

Wait, option A is 35. Could that be 32 (S) + 3 (Li)? No. 35 is the atomic number of Br, but atomic mass is higher. Wait, what elements sum to 35. Let's see: 16 (O) + 19 (K) = 35. So O and K. But would X contain O and K?

Alternatively, 25: 12 (C) +13 (Al) = 25. So C and Al. Maybe X is something like AlCl3? But AlCl3 is a Lewis acid, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let's think about another approach. The question mentions that the product of a keto acid with X has 2 oxygen atoms. Wait, if the product is a ketone, then it would have one O. But the question says two O atoms. Maybe the product is a carboxylic acid derivative, like an ester? No, because that would have more O's.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a hemiacetal or acetal, but that seems unrelated.

Wait, perhaps the keto acid reacts with X to form an enolate, which has a certain structure. Maybe the product is a ketone with two O's? Not sure.

Wait, maybe the product is a diketone, which has two O's. But then how does X contribute to that?

Alternatively, maybe the product is an ester, but that's speculative.

I'm not making much progress on this part, so perhaps I should think about the possible elements in X that sum to one of the options. Let's think about option C: 31.

Possible pairs: 16 (O) + 15 (P) =31. So O and P. X could be H3PO4 (phosphoric acid), but that's a triprotic acid. Not sure.

Another possibility: 12 (C) + 19 (K) = 31. So C and K. Maybe X is something like KCN? But I don't see the connection.

Alternatively, 1 (H) + 30 (Zn) = 31. But Zn isn't likely in an organic reagent.

Hmm, not helpful.

Wait, going back to the reaction, perhaps X is a metal that when reacts with a liquid (like water) produces H2 gas. But earlier thought that W would be H2 doesn't fit the neutron and proton count. So maybe that's not the right path.

Wait, another possibility: W is N2. If X reacts with something to produce N2, perhaps a decomposition reaction. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps X is a halogen, like Cl2. But Cl2 is a gas, not a liquid.

Alternatively, maybe X is a compound like HCl, which is a gas but can be a liquid under certain conditions. When HCl reacts with a liquid, maybe it's reacting with water, producing HCl solution and releasing... Not sure what gas would be released.

Wait, another angle: The reaction produces a precipitate G, which when heated releases B. If G is a carbonate, heating would release CO2 gas, leaving a metal oxide. But then B would be CO2, a gas, which doesn't fit the precipitate.

Hmm. Maybe G is a sulfate, but heating sulfate doesn't release much. Alternatively, G could be a hydroxide that dehydrates. For example, heating Cu(OH)2 gives CuO and water. But then B is CuO, which has a high melting point.

I'm stuck. Maybe I should try to find another approach.

The problem also says that X has a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. So, considering the options for X, perhaps it's a compound like CH3COOH (acetic acid), but that's an acid. Alternatively, maybe X is something like CCl4. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: the product of a keto acid with X has two oxygen atoms. Suppose X is a base like NaOH. The keto acid (like CH3COCH2COOH) would react with NaOH to form the sodium salt, which would be CH3COCH2COO^- Na^+. But the product would have more oxygen atoms, not fewer. So maybe that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a reducing agent, like LiAlH4, which reduces the keto acid. But that would produce an alcohol, which has an OH group, so two oxygen atoms in the product. Wait, the product would have an OH group, so one O. Hmm, not matching.

Wait, maybe the product is a ketone with two O's. No, that's not possible because a ketone has one O.

Wait, perhaps the product is a ketone with an ester group? No, that would have more O's.

Hmm. I think I'm going in circles here. Maybe I should try to think about the possible answers.

The options are A)35, B)25, C)31, D)29.

Let's think about each option:

Option A: 35. Could be 16 (O) + 19 (K) = 35. Or 35 is the atomic mass of Br. But Br is a single element.

Option B: 25. 12 (C) +13 (Al)=25. Or 25 is phosphorus's atomic mass (but P is 31). Wait, no, phosphorus has an atomic mass around 31.

Option C:31. Could be 15 (P) +16 (O) = 31. Or 31 is the atomic mass of Ar, but Ar is a noble gas.

Option D:29. 29 is the atomic mass of zinc (about 65.38, no). Wait, no. Wait, 29 is the atomic number of copper, which has an atomic mass around 63.55. Hmm, so 29 isn't the sum of two elements' atomic masses.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. The question says "cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X". So perhaps X is a compound with multiple elements, and we sum the lightest and heaviest.

Wait, for example, if X is NaOH, the elements are Na (23), O (16), H (1). The lightest is H (1), heaviest is Na (23). Sum is 24, which is not an option.

Another example: if X is KCl, which has K (39) and Cl (35.5). So lightest is Cl (35.5), heaviest is K (39). Sum is 74.5, not an option.

Wait, but wait, X is a substance used in organic chemistry. Maybe it's something like THF (tetrahydrofuran), but that's an organic solvent. Not sure.

Wait, another possibility: X is carbon tetrachloride (CCl4). But that's a solvent, not a reagent in organic chemistry. Alternatively, maybe X is something like H2O, but that's not a reagent in itself.

Wait, perhaps X is a compound like H2SO4. Sulfuric acid. The elements are H, S, O. The lightest is H (1), heaviest is S (32.07). Sum is 33.07, which is not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps X is something like CH3COOH (acetic acid). The elements are C, H, O. Lightest is H (1), heaviest is O (16). Sum is 17, which isn't an option.

Wait, maybe X is a compound with two elements. For example, if X is Cl2O7 (chloric acid?), but that's not commonly used as a reagent.

Another thought: the product of the reaction of a keto acid with X contains two oxygen atoms. Suppose X is a base like NaOH. The reaction would deprotonate the keto acid, forming a carboxylate ion. The product would be something like RCOO^- Na^+.

Wait, but the problem says the product has two oxygen atoms. The carboxylate ion has two O's in the COO^- group. Oh! So maybe the product is the sodium salt of the keto acid, which would have two O's from the COO^- group.

If that's the case, then the product has two O atoms. So, the reaction is between a keto acid and a base (like NaOH), producing a carboxylate salt.

So, if X is NaOH, then the elements in X are Na and O and H. The lightest is H (1), heaviest is Na (23). Sum is 24, which isn't an option.

Wait, but the question says the product contains 2 atoms of oxygen. The salt has two O's in the COO^- group. So that fits.

Now, X is NaOH. Then, Substance X is NaOH. But NaOH doesn't have a heavier isotope as one of its elements. Wait, Na has isotopes. The common isotope is Na-23, but there's also Na-24 and others, but they are rare. So perhaps X is NaOH, and one of its elements (Na) has a heavier isotope. So that fits the first part.

But then, back to the reaction. X (NaOH) reacts with liquid Y. What would Y be? Maybe Y is an acid. If Y is an acid, say H2SO4, then the reaction would be a neutralization, producing Na2SO4, water, and perhaps some gas. But I'm not sure what gas that would be.

Alternatively, if Y is a carbonate, the reaction would produce CO2 and Na2CO3. Wait, but that's speculative.

Hmm, but earlier I thought W could be O2, N2, or CO2. So perhaps in this scenario, W is CO2, and Y is a carbonate solution.

Wait, let's piece it together:

X is NaOH.

Y is a carbonate solution (like Na2CO3 or K2CO3).

Reaction: X (NaOH) reacts with Y (say, another carbonate). But I'm not sure what that would produce. Alternatively, perhaps Y is a different carbonate and X is a metal hydroxide.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a metal carbonate, and X is NaOH. The reaction would be: 2 NaOH + MCO3 → Na2CO3 + M(OH)2.

But I'm not sure if that would produce a gas. Alternatively, if Y is a metal carbonate, then adding NaOH might not produce a gas. Hmm.

Wait, maybe Y is a different base. Alternatively, perhaps X is a stronger base and reacts with Y to produce gas.

Another possibility: X is NaOH, Y is a solution of a metal carbonate, and the reaction produces CO2 gas. But I'm not certain.

Wait, regardless, if X is NaOH, then the elements are Na, O, H. The lightest is H (1), heaviest is Na (23). Sum is 24. Not an option.

Hmm, not matching any of the options. So perhaps X isn't NaOH.

Wait, another approach: The product of the reaction of a keto acid with X has two O atoms. So perhaps X is a metal that when reacts with a keto acid forms a product with two O's. Maybe X is Mg and the reaction forms Mg salts.

Wait, Mg reacts with a keto acid (like CH3COOH) to form Mg acetate and hydrogen gas. Mg(CH3COO)2. The product has O's from the acetate group. Each acetate has two O's. So the product would have four O's per Mg ion. But the question says two O atoms. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the product is a magnesium salt with two O's. Not sure.

Wait, perhaps the product is a ketone. But how? Mg doesn't typically reduce keto acids to ketones.

Hmm. I'm getting stuck again.

Wait, going back to the main question: what is the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X.

If I think about the options, perhaps the correct answer is D)29. How could that happen?

Suppose X contains C (12) and O (16). 12 +16=28. Close to 29. Or maybe another combination.

Alternatively, perhaps X is CO (carbon monoxide). Then elements are C (12) and O (16). Sum is 28. Not 29.

Wait, another possibility: X contains H (1) and Cl (35.5). 1 + 35.5=36.5. Not an option. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the elements are O (16) and K (39). 16+39=55. Not an option.

Wait, another angle: the cumulative atomic masses are summed for all instances. Wait, the question says, "if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed." Wait, that's confusing. Wait, the problem says: "the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X, considering that if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed."

Wait, maybe X has multiple atoms of the same element, and their isotopes are considered. For example, if X has two Cl atoms, each with different isotopes.

Wait, but I'm not sure how that plays into the sum.

Alternatively, perhaps the mass is calculated as the sum of all the lightest and heaviest elements in the compound, considering each occurrence.

Wait, perhaps X is something like H2O. Lightest is H (1), heaviest is O (16). Sum is 17, but that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a more complex compound. Let me think of another possible X.

Wait, another thought: the initial reaction. If X is a metal that reacts with liquid Y to produce gas W. Let me think of metals that react violently with liquids to produce specific gases.

Wait, another possibility: Y is a halogenated hydrocarbon. For example, if X is Na and Y is carbon tetrachloride, but I don't think that reacts violently.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a metal, and Y is a solution of a halide. For example, Mg and a solution of HCl. Mg reacts with HCl to produce MgCl2, H2 gas. But again, W would be H2, which doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps Y is a solution of a sulfide. For example, FeS in HCl produces H2S gas, but earlier analysis said H2S doesn't fit W's condition.

Hmm.

I'm really stuck, but I think the best approach is to make an educated guess based on the information given. Let's recap:

- X is used in organic chemistry, likely a reagent like NaOH, KOH, or a metal.
- X has a heavier isotope, so elements like Cl, S, or Br are possible.
- The product of X and a keto acid has two O atoms, likely a carboxylate.
- The reaction of X with Y produces gas W (O2, N2, or CO2), precipitate G, which upon heating gives B with melting point ~4°C.

Wait, if B has a melting point of 4°C, what is B? Maybe it's a hydrate. For example, sodium acetate trihydrate has a melting point around 58°C, which is higher. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: perhaps B is a different compound. What about ammonium nitrate? No, that's way higher. Alternatively, perhaps B is something like calcium nitrate tetrahydrate, which has a melting point around 25°C. Closer to 277 K (4°C), but not exact.

Alternatively, perhaps B is a different type of salt. I'm not getting anywhere with this.

Wait, perhaps B is a metal that has a low melting point. For example, mercury is liquid at room temp, but its melting point is -39°C. Not 4°C.

Wait, perhaps B is a hydrate. Let me think: perhaps the formula is something like MgSO4·7H2O. Its melting point is about 20°C. Close to 277 K (4°C). Maybe.

So, if G when heated releases B, which is MgSO4·7H2O, then G would be a compound that, upon heating, loses some water and becomes B. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps G is a sulfate hydrate, and upon heating, it loses water to form a different hydrate or an anhydrous sulfate.

But again, not directly helpful.

I think I've exhausted my options. Perhaps the best approach is to make an educated guess based on the given options and the possible elements in X.

If the sum is 29, which is option D, that could be 23 (Na) + 6 (C) → 29. But that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, 16 (O) + 13 (Al) = 29. So if X contains O and Al, perhaps.

Wait, another thought: the reaction of X with Y produces a precipitate G which is Al(OH)3. Heating Al(OH)3 would give Al2O3 and water. The melting point of Al2O3 is very high, around 2000°C. Doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps X is Al, reacting with a strong base to produce H2 gas. But earlier analysis said W would be H2, which doesn't fit.

Wait, another possibility: X is carbon, and reacts with Y (maybe a solution) to produce CO2. Then W is CO2, which fits the condition.

If X is carbon, then the elements are C. But then, how about the heavier isotope? Carbon has C-12, C-13, and C-14. So X could be a compound with a heavier isotope, like C-13 or C-14.

But then, the reaction of a keto acid with X (carbon) doesn't make much sense. Unless it's a reduction, but that's unclear.

Hmm. I think I'm stuck. I'll have to make an educated guess based on the information I have.

The correct answer is likely D)29. I think X is a compound containing O and Al, so their masses sum to 29. Alternatively, maybe it's another combination.

But I'm not entirely confident. Another approach: looking for elements where the sum is one of the options.

Wait, the options are 35, 25, 31, 29.

If X is a compound with Cl and something else. Cl has a mass of ~35.5. So 35.5 + something = option.

Option A is 35. So if the other element is H (1), sum is 36.5. Not an option. If the other element is O (16), sum is 51.5. Not an option.

Option C is 31. 31-35.5 = negative, so no. Hmm.

Wait, maybe X is a diatomic molecule with elements like O and Cl. No, but OCl2 is a compound, but not a diatomic.

Alternatively, perhaps X contains two elements where the sum is 29. For example, 12 (C) +17 (Cl) = 29. C and Cl.

But Cl's atomic mass is ~35.5, so 12 +35.5=47.5, which isn't 29.

Wait, I'm getting more confused. Maybe I should think that the correct answer is B)25.

But I'm not sure. I think I'll have to go with the information I have and make a best guess.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves identifying Substance X, which reacts with liquid Y to produce gas W, precipitate G, and releases B upon heating. The melting point of B is approximately 277 K (4°C). Additionally, the product of a keto acid reacting with X contains two oxygen atoms. X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry and incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. The task is to calculate the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Gas W**: The molecule of W has the same number of protons and neutrons. Possible candidates are O₂ (16 protons, 16 neutrons) and CO₂ (22 protons, 22 neutrons). These are the most plausible options based on the given condition.

2. **Precipitate G and B**: When G is heated, it releases B, which has a melting point close to 277 K (4°C). This suggests B could be a hydrate or a compound with a low melting point. However, the exact identity of B remains unclear.

3. **Reaction with Keto Acid**: The product of the reaction between X and a keto acid contains two oxygen atoms. This implies the product could be a carboxylate salt, where the carboxylate group (COO⁻) contributes two oxygen atoms.

4. **Substance X**: X is used in organic chemistry, suggesting it could be a base like NaOH or a metal like Mg. X also incorporates a heavier isotope, indicating elements like Cl, S, or Br, which have common isotopes.

5. **Cumulative Atomic Masses**: The question asks for the sum of the atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X. Possible combinations were analyzed:
   - If X contains H (1) and Cl (35.5), the sum is 36.5, which is not an option.
   - If X contains C (12) and O (16), the sum is 28, which is also not an option.
   - If X contains O (16) and Al (27), the sum is 43, which is not an option.

6. **Options Analysis**:
   - **Option A (35)**: Could correspond to O (16) + K (19) = 35.
   - **Option B (25)**: Could correspond to C (12) + Al (13) = 25.
   - **Option C (31)**: Could correspond to P (31) alone, but this is less likely.
   - **Option D (29)**: Could correspond to O (16) + Al (13) = 29.

Given the constraints and the analysis, the most plausible answer is **Option D (29)**, assuming X contains O and Al.

Answer: D
