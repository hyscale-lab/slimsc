Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and the area of a pseudosphere. Hmm. Let me try to think this through. I'm a bit rusty on my differential geometry, but I'll give it a shot.

First, the metric given is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). I remember that the metric tensor tells us about the geometry of the space. So, this is a two-dimensional metric because there are two coordinates, x and y. 

Wait, pseudosphere... Oh right, a pseudosphere is a surface with constant negative curvature. But wait, in this case, the metric seems to be in two dimensions. So maybe it's a model of hyperbolic space?

I think the area of a pseudosphere relates to the Gaussian curvature. For a surface of constant curvature, the area can be calculated using the Gauss-Bonnet theorem. But wait, this is a metric in 2D. So perhaps it's a hyperbolic plane, and the pseudosphere has infinite area? Or maybe the metric here is compact.

Wait, the denominator in the metric is 4 - x² - y². That looks similar to the metric for spheres, where the denominator is (1 - r²), but here it's 4 minus x² and y². So that suggests some condition on x and y. Because if x² + y² approaches 4, the denominator approaches zero, making the metric blow up. So the region where x² + y² <4 would be allowed, but beyond that, it's not defined. So the coordinates x and y must lie within a circle of radius 2, because 4 is 2 squared.

So the domain is a disk of radius 2 in the x-y plane. But the metric isn't flat; it's scaled by 32/(4 - x² - y²). This reminds me of the metric in conformally flat coordinates. So the area element would be the determinant of the metric tensor times dx dy. 

The metric tensor here is diagonal, so the determinant is just (32/(4 - x² - y²))². Wait, no, wait: the metric tensor g has components g_xx and g_yy, which are both 32/(4 - x² - y²). So the determinant is (32/(4 - r²))², where r² is x² + y².

Wait, but the area element dA is sqrt(det(g)) dx dy. Since the metric is conformally flat, the area element would be (32/(4 - r²)) dx dy. Hmm, because for a conformal metric ds² = e^{2φ} (dx² + dy²), the area element is e^{2φ} dx dy. So here, φ would be (1/2) ln(32/(4 - r²)), but that's not necessary for calculating the area.

Wait, but let me compute the area of this space. The integral over all allowed x and y. So the area would be the integral over x² + y² <4, of [32/(4 - r²)] dx dy. Hmm, but wait, 32 is a constant factor, so I can take that out.

But wait, the allowed region is a disk of radius 2. So I can switch to polar coordinates. Let r² = x² + y², so dr² = 2r dx dy? Wait, no, in polar coordinates, dx dy = r dr dθ. So the integral becomes the integral from r=0 to r=2, and θ from 0 to 2π, of [32/(4 - r²)] * r dr dθ.

So the area A is 32 * ∫ (from θ=0 to 2π) ∫ (r=0 to 2) [r/(4 - r²)] dr dθ.

Breaking it into angular part and radial part. The angular integral is 2π, so:

A = 32 * 2π * ∫ (r=0 to 2) [ r/(4 - r²) ] dr.

Let's compute that integral. Let me make a substitution: let u = 4 - r². Then du/dr = -2r → (-1/2) du = r dr. When r=0, u=4. When r=2, u=0. So the integral becomes:

∫ [ r dr/(4 - r²) ] = ∫ [ (-1/2) du/u ] from u=4 to u=0.

Which is (-1/2) [ ln |u| ] from 4 to 0. Wait, but when u goes from 4 down to 0, the limits become from 4 to 0. So the integral is (-1/2)(ln 0 - ln4). But ln0 is negative infinity; so this integral diverges.

Wait, that can't be right. Because as r approaches 2 from below, the denominator approaches zero. So the integral would blow up. So the area becomes infinite. But wait, that's in the metric where the area element becomes large near r=2. So the area is infinite.

But the question is about a pseudosphere of radius r=2. Wait, a pseudosphere is a surface, not a 2D space. Or maybe I'm misunderstanding. Alternatively, perhaps the metric given is that of a pseudosphere. Wait, but the metric provided is in two dimensions, so perhaps it's a model of the hyperbolic plane, which has infinite area. Or maybe it's a sphere with a different kind of metric.

Wait, another approach: the given metric is similar to the metric of a sphere. The standard sphere metric is (dx² + dy²)/(1 - (x² + y²)/R²), but that's for a sphere of radius R. Wait, in our case, the denominator is (4 - x² - y²), which would be 4 - r² = 4(1 - (r²)/4) = 4(1 - (r/(2))²). So maybe this is a sphere of radius 2, but only in certain coordinates.

Wait, but the metric for a sphere of radius 2 would have a denominator of (1 - (x² + y²)/(4)), so 4 - (x² + y²) ) would be in the denominator. So maybe it's the same. But the metric given is 32/(4 - x² - y²) times (dx² + dy²). So the area element would be [32/(4 - r²)] dx dy. But in spherical coordinates, the area element for a sphere of radius a is a² sinθ dθ dφ. Hmm, but that's a different scenario.

Wait, but perhaps the metric is that of a sphere, but scaled somehow. Or maybe it's a hyperbolic metric. Alternatively, perhaps the given metric is a conformal metric, so the area is being stretched by a function of r.

Wait, but let's get back to the problem. The question is about the area of a pseudosphere with radius 2. A pseudosphere is a surface with constant negative curvature. So its Gaussian curvature is negative.

But the metric given is in two dimensions, so perhaps it's a model of hyperbolic geometry. The area of a hyperbolic plane is infinite, but a pseudosphere (which is a finite surface) would have finite area. Wait, but a pseudosphere is a surface of revolution, like a tractricoid. Its Gaussian curvature is constant and negative.

Wait, but maybe the metric given is not of a pseudosphere but of a sphere. Because the denominator looks like a sphere metric. For a sphere of radius a, the standard metric in polar coordinates is (r² dr² + a² dθ²)/(1 - r²/a²) ), but that's in 3D. Alternatively, in 2D, the metric for the sphere can be written as (dx² + dy²)/(1 - (x² + y²)/a²), which is similar to the given metric.

Wait, if the denominator is 4 - x² - y², that's the same as 4(1 - (x² + y²)/4) = 4(1 - (r²)/4). So a=2. So this metric would be for a sphere of radius 2. Then, the area of a sphere is 4π a², which is 4π*(2)^2=16π, but that's not among the options.

Wait the options are:

A) 0

B) 4π (x² + y²)

C) 4π (x² - y²)

D)+infty

Wait, none of them has a numerical value like 16π. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the metric represents a pseudosphere (a surface of constant negative curvature), not a sphere. So then, the Gaussian curvature is negative.

Wait, the Gaussian curvature K for a conformal metric e^{2φ}(dx² + dy²) is given by -e^{-2φ} (Δφ), where Δ is the Laplacian. Alternatively, I remember that for the metric ds² = E dx² + E dy² (E being a function), the Gaussian curvature K is given by - (1/(2E)) * Δ(ln E), where Δ is the flat Laplacian.

So in our case, E = 32/(4 - x^2 - y^2) = 32/(4 - r²). Let me compute ln E = ln(32) - ln(4 - r²). The Laplacian in 2D is (1/r) d/dr (r d/dr), so let's compute Δ(ln E):

Δ(ln E) = (1/r) d/dr [r * d/dr (ln E) ]

d/dr (ln E) = d/dr [ ln(32) - ln(4 - r²) ] = 0 + (2r)/(4 - r²)

So,

d/dr (ln E) = (2r)/(4 - r²)

Then,

(1/r) d/dr [ r * (2r)/(4 - r²) ) ] = (1/r) d/dr [ (2 r²)/(4 - r²) ) ]

Let me compute the derivative inside:

(2 r²)/(4 - r²) = 2 r² (4 - r²)^{-1}

Using the quotient rule: derivative is [ (4 r (4 - r²) ) + (2 r²)*(2 r) ) ] / (4 - r²)^2

Wait, wait, let me compute it properly.

d/dr [ 2 r² (4 - r²)^{-1} ] = 2 [ 2r (4 - r²)^{-1} + r² * ( -1 ) (4 - r²)^{-2} (-2r) ) ]

Wait, more accurately, using product rule: derivative of 2r² is 4r, times (4 - r²)^{-1}, plus 2r² times derivative of (4 - r²)^{-1}.

Derivative of (4 - r²)^{-1} is (-1)*(4 - r²)^{-2} * (-2r) ) = 2r (4 - r²)^{-2}

So putting it together:

4r (4 - r²)^{-1} + 2r² * [ 2r (4 - r²)^{-2} ]

= 4r/(4 - r²) + 4 r^3/(4 - r²)^2

So back to the Laplacian:

(1/r) * [4r/(4 - r²) + 4 r^3/(4 - r²)^2 ] 

= (1/r) * [4r (4 - r²) + 4 r^3 ] / (4 - r²)^2 

Wait, no, wait. I think I made a mistake here. Let me recompute.

Wait, the expression after the derivative is [4r/(4 - r²) + (4 r^3)/(4 - r²)^2 ]

So when I factor (1/r), it becomes:

(1/r) [4r/(4 - r²) + 4 r^3/(4 - r²)^2 ] 
= 4/(4 - r²) + (4 r²)/(4 - r²)^2 

Hmm, but this seems complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute it more carefully.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute the Gaussian curvature formula directly. For a conformal metric g = e^{2φ} (dx² + dy²), the Gaussian curvature is K = -e^{-2φ} [ (e^{2φ}) ]_{rr} - (1/(2r)) [ (e^{2φ}) ]_{θθ} } ?

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Another approach: The formula for Gaussian curvature K of a metric g = E(dx² + dy²) is K = - (1/(2E)) [ (E_r)_r + (E_y)_y ] ?

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute the Gaussian curvature for the given metric. Let me proceed step by step.

Given g_{xx} = g_{yy} = 32/(4 - r²), so the metric is E = g_{xx} = 32/(4 - r²), which is a function of r only.

The Gaussian curvature K is given by K = -(1/(2E)) [ (E') + (E'') + (E/r) ) ] ?

Wait, perhaps I should look up the formula for Gaussian curvature in polar coordinates. Wait, I think the formula is:

K = - [ (e^{2φ})_{rr} + (e^{2φ})_{θθ} + 2/(r) (e^{2φ})_r ] / 2 ?

Wait, but maybe I should use the standard formula for Gaussian curvature in terms of the metric components. Alternatively, for a conformally flat metric, K can be expressed in terms of the function φ, where E = e^{2φ}.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to calculate the curvature using the formula:

K = - (1/(2E)) [ (E_r)_r + (E_θ)_θ + (E/r) ]

Wait, perhaps I should use the fact that for a metric ds² = E dr² + F dθ² + ... but since it's diagonal and axisymmetric, F = E, and the metric is E (dr² + r² dθ²).

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe it's better to compute the Ricci scalar in 2D, which equals the Gaussian curvature. For a metric ds² = A(r) dr² + B(r) r² dθ², the Gaussian curvature K is given by:

K = - [ B'' + (B' )/(A) ) + ( (A' B' )/(A) ) + (A'' B )/(A) ) + (B' )/(r) ) ] / (2 A B )

Wait, I'm not confident about this formula. Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to compute the Christoffel symbols and then the Ricci scalar.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the known result that for a metric of the form ds² = (e^{2φ(r)}) (dr² + r² dθ²), the Gaussian curvature is K = - e^{-2φ} [ φ'' + (φ')² + (1/r) φ' ].

Wait, let me see. So for our metric, E = 32/(4 - r²) = e^{2φ}, so φ = (1/2) ln(32/(4 - r²)).

Compute φ':

φ' = (1/2) [ (d/dr) ( ln(32/(4 - r²)) ) ) ]
= (1/2) [ ( (0) - [ (-2r)/(4 - r²) ) ] ) / (32/(4 - r²)) ) ] ?

Wait, no, wait. d/dr [ln(32/(4 - r^2))] = d/dr [ln(32)] - d/dr [ln(4 - r^2)] = 0 - [ (-2r)/(4 - r²) ) ] = (2r)/(4 - r²).

So φ' = (1/2) * (2r)/(4 - r²) ) = r/(4 - r²).

Then, φ'' = derivative of r/(4 - r²) with respect to r:

= [ (1)(4 - r²) - r (-2r) ] / (4 - r²)^2
= [ (4 - r²) + 2 r² ] / (4 - r^2)^2
= (4 + r²) / (4 - r^2)^2.

So now, plug into the curvature formula:

K = - e^{-2φ} [ φ'' + (φ')² + (1/r) φ' ]

e^{-2φ} = [32/(4 - r²)]^{-1} = (4 - r^2)/32.

So,

K = - (4 - r^2)/(32) [ (4 + r²)/(4 - r^2)^2 + (r^2)/(4 - r^2)^2 + (1/r) ( r/(4 - r^2) ) ) ]

Simplify each term inside the brackets:

First term: (4 + r²)/(4 - r^2)^2.

Second term: (φ')² = [ r/(4 - r²) ]^2 = r²/(4 - r²)^2.

Third term: (1/r)( r/(4 - r^2) ) ) = 1/(4 - r^2).

So,

[ (4 + r² + r² )/(4 - r^2)^2 + 1/(4 - r^2) ) ]

= [ (4 + 2 r²)/(4 - r^2)^2 + 1/(4 - r^2) ) ]

Let me write 1/(4 - r^2) as (4 - r^2)/(4 - r^2)^2, so:

= [ (4 + 2 r²) + (4 - r^2) ] / (4 - r^2)^2

= [ 4 + 2 r² +4 - r^2 ] / (4 - r^2)^2

= (8 + r²) / (4 - r^2)^2.

So now, K becomes:

K = - (4 - r^2)/(32) * (8 + r²)/(4 - r^2)^2 )

Simplify:

= - (8 + r²) / [32 (4 - r^2) ]

Hmm, that's the Gaussian curvature. Wait, but for a pseudosphere, the Gaussian curvature is a negative constant. But in this case, K depends on r. So that suggests that the curvature isn't constant. So maybe this isn't a pseudosphere, but a sphere or something else.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculations. Let me double-check.

Wait, the calculation for K after substituting everything seems correct, but the result is K = -(8 + r²)/(32 (4 - r^2)) ), which varies with r. So unless 8 + r² is proportional to (4 - r^2), which isn't the case, the Gaussian curvature isn't constant. So this suggests that the given metric isn't that of a pseudosphere, which requires constant negative curvature.

Hmm, perhaps the question is confusing, or I'm misunderstanding it. Alternatively, perhaps the metric describes a sphere, but let's think again. The area of the sphere would be 4π a², where a is the radius. In this case, a is 2, so the area would be 16π. But that's not one of the options. The options are 0, 4π(x² + y²), 4π(x² - y²), or infinite.

Wait, but option D is +infty, which could be the case if the area is infinite. But earlier, when I tried to compute the area by integrating the area element, I found that the integral diverges as r approaches 2. So the area would be infinite.

Wait, but the question is about a pseudosphere of radius 2. So if the given metric isn't that of a pseudosphere, maybe my entire approach is wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the area of the pseudosphere can be computed using the metric provided, which is in a certain coordinate system. The pseudosphere has finite area, but perhaps the metric given applies to an infinite space, hence area is infinite.

Wait, the given metric is (32/(4 - x² - y²))(dx² + dy²). So the domain is x² + y² <4. Because when x² + y^2 approaches 4, the denominator approaches zero, causing the metric to blow up. So the space is a disk of radius 2, but with a metric that becomes singular at the boundary.

So what is the area of this space? The area element is [32/(4 - r^2)] r dr dθ. So integrating from r=0 to 2, and θ=0 to 2π.

The integral becomes ∫ (from 0 to 2π) dθ ∫ (from 0 to 2) [32 r/(4 - r²)] dr.

The angular integral is 2π. The radial integral is ∫0^2 [32 r/(4 -r²)] dr.

Let me compute the radial integral. Let u =4 - r² → du = -2r dr → (-1/2) du = r dr.

When r=0, u=4; r=2, u=0.

So the integral becomes ∫ (from u=4 to 0) [32 * (-1/2) du/u ]

= (-16) ∫ (4 to 0) (du/u)
= (-16) [ ln u ] from 4 to 0

= (-16) [ ln 0 - ln4 ]

But ln 0 is -infty, so ln0 - ln4 = -infty - ln4 = -infty.

So the integral becomes (-16) * (-infty) = +infty. So the area is infinite.

Therefore, the pseudosphere (if this is the case) would have infinite area. But wait, the pseudosphere is a finite surface. Or is the given metric representing a different kind of space?

Wait, perhaps the question is referring to the area of the pseudosphere, which is a finite surface, but the given metric describes a space that's not the pseudosphere itself.

Alternatively, perhaps the pseudosphere's radius in this context is related to the curvature, but I'm getting stuck. 

Given the options, option D is +infty, which seems to align with the calculation we did earlier. So the area is infinite.

The given metric is 

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left(dx^2 + dy^2\right),
\]

and the task is to determine the area of the pseudosphere of radius \(r = 2\). To analyze this, we first note that the metric is defined in two dimensions, with coordinates \(x\) and \(y\). The denominator \(4 - x^2 - y^2\) suggests that the domain of the metric is restricted to \(x^2 + y^2 < 4\), corresponding to a disk of radius 2 in the \(x\)-\(y\) plane. 

The metric is conformally flat, meaning it can be written as \(ds^2 = e^{2\phi}(dx^2 + dy^2)\), where \(\phi = \frac{1}{2} \ln(32/(4 - x^2 - y^2))\). The area element in such a metric is given by \(\sqrt{\det(g)} \, dx \, dy\), where \(\det(g)\) is the determinant of the metric tensor. For this metric, \(\det(g) = \left(\frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2}\right)^2\), so the area element becomes:

\[
dA = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \, dx \, dy.
\]

To compute the total area, we integrate \(dA\) over the entire domain \(x^2 + y^2 < 4\). Switching to polar coordinates (\(x^2 + y^2 = r^2\), \(dx \, dy = r \, dr \, d\theta\)), the integral becomes:

\[
A = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^2 \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \, r \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

The angular integral \(\int_0^{2\pi} d\theta = 2\pi\) is straightforward. The radial integral is:

\[
\int_0^2 \frac{32 \, r}{4 - r^2} \, dr.
\]

Using the substitution \(u = 4 - r^2\), \(du = -2r \, dr\), the limits of integration change as follows: when \(r = 0\), \(u = 4\), and when \(r = 2\), \(u = 0\). The integral becomes:

\[
\int_4^0 \frac{32}{u} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right) du = 16 \int_0^4 \frac{1}{u} \, du.
\]

The integral \(\int \frac{1}{u} \, du = \ln|u|\), so:

\[
16 \int_0^4 \frac{1}{u} \, du = 16 \left[\ln u\right]_0^4 = 16 \left(\ln 4 - \ln 0\right).
\]

Since \(\ln 0 = -\infty\), the integral diverges, and the area becomes infinite. This suggests that the space described by the given metric has infinite extent, even though the domain \(x^2 + y^2 < 4\) is finite. 

Given the options, the correct answer is:

**A) 0**: This is incorrect because the area is not zero.  
**B) \(4\pi(x^2 + y^2)\)**: This is incorrect because the area does not depend on \(x\) and \(y\).  
**C) \(4\pi(x^2 - y^2)\)**: This is incorrect for the same reason as option B.  
**D) \(+\infty\)**: This is correct because the integral for the area diverges.

Thus, the area of the pseudosphere of radius \(r = 2\) is infinite.

Answer: D
