Alright, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the answer step by step. Let me try to break it down.

The question involves a series of reactions starting from 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember that adamantane is a diamondoid structure, kind of a polycyclic compound, so it's pretty rigid.

First reaction: Heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with excess KOH at 240Â°C. KOH is a strong base, and when dibromides react with bases, it's usually an elimination reaction. So, it's likely an E2 mechanism here. Since the molecule is symmetric (1,3-dibromo), the elimination should form an alkene. The product would be 1,3-adamantadiene, perhaps. But wait, I think the product might be a more substituted alkene because of Zaitsev's rule. So, if the two bromines are on adjacent carbons (like 1 and 3 in adamantane), eliminating H from each would form a double bond. But wait, adamantane's structure is a diamondoid, so the positions might be such that elimination forms a bridgehead double bond. Oh wait, bridgehead double bonds are generally not allowed due to Bredt's rule because of the angle strain. Hmm, but adamantane is a very rigid structure, maybe the bridgehead can handle it? Or perhaps the reaction forms a more substituted double bond elsewhere. Alternatively, maybe it's forming an allene or something else... Hmm, I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, the product described is a light yellow solid. The NMR spectrum of product 1 has a peak at 4.79 ppm (2H). That's a deshielded proton, maybe an -OH or an alkoxy group. Oh, but wait, KOH is a base, so if it's elimination, perhaps it's an epoxide? No, wait, elimination would form an alkene. Alternatively, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation leading to an alkene, but the product's NMR shows something else.

Wait, looking at the IR data: a strong absorbance at 1720 cm-1. That's probably a carbonyl group, like a ketone or ester. So maybe the first reaction isn't elimination but a substitution.

Wait, when KOH is used with vicinal dihalides (two adjacent halogens), it can lead to elimination (forming an alkene) or substitution if the conditions are different. But wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane isn't a vicinal dihalide, it's 1,3-dibromo, which are on adjacent bridgeheads, I think. So perhaps when heated with KOH, it undergoes elimination to form a double bond, but wait, if that's not possible due to Bredt's rule, maybe it's a substitution.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up substitution and elimination. Let me think again. When 1,3-dibromoadamantane reacts with KOH, perhaps it undergoes a double elimination, losing two equivalents of HBr and forming an alkene. But if the structure is such that the double bond can't be at the bridgehead, maybe it forms a bridge elsewhere. Alternatively, maybe the product is a ketone. Wait, the IR at 1720 suggests a carbonyl, but that's in the product after KOH. Wait, no, product 1 is after KOH. So product 1 has a carbonyl.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the KOH is causing a Hofmann elimination or some kind of substitution. Alternatively, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation with two bromides. Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane has two bromine atoms across the bridge. So when treated with a strong base like KOH, maybe it undergoes a double elimination, losing two HBr molecules and forming a conjugated diene. But then, the IR would show a peak for a diene's C=C, which is around 1640 cm-1, but the IR here is at 1720, which is more like a carbonyl. Hmm, that's conflicting.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the structure. 1,3-dibromoadamantane: the adamantane structure has four bridgeheads, each connected to three CH2 groups, but the positions 1 and 3 would be two of the bridgeheads. So perhaps the structure allows for elimination across two adjacent bridgeheads, forming a double bond between them. But that would be a bridgehead double bond, which isn't allowed. So maybe it doesn't form an alkene but instead something else.

Wait, another reaction for dihalides with strong bases is the formation of epoxides. But that requires two adjacent halogens, which isn't the case here. So that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe it's a nucleophilic substitution, but for each Br, but that would require a good leaving group. Wait, KOH is a strong base, so maybe it's deprotonating something else.

Alternatively, perhaps when the two Br atoms are eliminated, they form a diketone. But how? Oh wait, maybe the reaction is a pinacol-like rearrangement, but that typically involves vicinal diols. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the dihalide is undergoing a substitution with the base, but that would require a better leaving group. Wait, perhaps the base abstracts a beta hydrogen, leading to an elimination, but if the structure doesn't allow that, maybe it's forming a carbonyl group. Let me think differently.

Wait, another approach: looking at the NMR of product 1. The 1H NMR shows 4.79 ppm for 2H. That's a singlet? Or a multiplet? The description says 4.79 (2H). So perhaps it's a singlet, but maybe it's a triplet or something else. Wait, 4.79 is a region where -CH2-O- protons appear, or maybe -OCH2CH2O- as in a diether. Or maybe it's an epoxide's protons, but epoxide protons are usually around 3-4 ppm. Alternatively, it could be an alcohol's -OH, but that's a broad peak, and the problem says it's 4.79, which is more like a sharp peak, so maybe an ether.

Wait, but the IR shows a carbonyl at 1720. So perhaps product 1 is a ketone. How would that happen from 1,3-dibromoadamantane under KOH? Could it be a dehydrohalogenation followed by some rearrangement?

Wait, maybe it's a Fittig reaction, but that typically forms an aryl ether when two aryl halides are heated with Na or K. But adamantane isn't aromatic, so that's unlikely.

Hmm, maybe the base abstracts protons causing an elimination, but the structure can't form a double bond, so it forms a carbonyl. Wait, another thought: the base could cause an oxidation, but KOH isn't an oxidizing agent. Alternatively, perhaps the elimination forms a conjugated diene which then undergoes some di-elimination to form a carbonyl. Or, maybe each Br is replaced by an OH group via hydrolysis. Wait, but that would give a diol. 1,3-diol. But that wouldn't explain the IR at 1720.

Wait, perhaps the product is a diketone. But how? 1,3-dibromoadamantane could lose two HBr molecules if each Br is replaced by an O-. Wait, but under KOH conditions, that might not happen.

Alternatively, perhaps each Br is replaced by an -O-K+ group, but that would make a diether, not a ketone.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a double elimination, but instead of forming a double bond, it forms a ketone. How? Let's imagine that each Br is on a carbon adjacent to a bridgehead. When KOH abstracts a hydrogen adjacent to Br, the Br leaves, forming a carbanion, which then could lead to a carbonyl group. But I'm not quite sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the base is causing an elimination to form a carbonyl. Wait, maybe each Br is eliminated with a neighboring H, forming an alkene but resulting in a carbonyl. Wait, that doesn't make much sense.

I'm a bit stuck here. Let me think about the IR. 1720 is a strong carbonyl. So product 1 has a ketone group. So from 1,3-dibromoadamantane plus KOH, how do I get a ketone?

Wait, maybe it's dehydrohalogenation forming a carbonyl via a conjugated elimination. For example, if two adjacent Brs lose HBr and form a carbonyl. But I'm not sure about that mechanism.

Alternatively, perhaps each Br is replaced by an O- group, and then something happens. But I'm not getting it.

Wait, another approach: the NMR of product 1. The 4.79 ppm (2H) could be an -OCH2CH2O- group, but that's more typical for an ether. Alternatively, maybe it's an epoxide, but I thought their protons are around 3-4 ppm.

Alternatively, maybe those 2H are part of a cyclopropane ring, but that's a stretch.

Wait, perhaps when 1,3-dibromoadamantane is treated with KOH, it undergoes a double elimination, but instead of forming a double bond, it forms a ketone via some kind of rearrangement. Maybe each Br is adjacent to a CH2 group, and eliminating both leads to a carbonyl. For instance, if each Br is on a CH2, eliminating both could lead to a conjugated diene, but then maybe further reaction, like oxidation, but KOH isn't oxidizing. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps each Br is replaced by an O-, and then it undergoes some kind of cyclization to form a carbonyl. But without more info, I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the next step. Product 1 is treated with excess Al isopropoxide, which is a Lewis acid catalyst often used in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. But product 1 has a ketone, so perhaps it undergoes some kind of acylation.

Wait, product 1 is a ketone. Then, when it is heated with Al isopropoxide (which is used as a catalyst in Friedel-Crafts), perhaps it undergoes an acylation to form a new ketone or an ester. But wait, adamantane derivatives are usually pretty non-reactive because of their structure. Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an epoxide, which upon heating with Al isopropoxide would undergo ring-opening. But earlier I thought the IR didn't support that.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diol. If product 1 is a diol (1,3-adamantanediol), then heating with Al isopropoxide might cause it to form an acetal or something else. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is a diketone. Then, using Al isopropoxide, perhaps it undergoes some kind of cyclization.

Hmm, but I'm not getting much further. Let me think again. The initial reaction between 1,3-dibromoadamantane and KOH. Maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation reaction, but if the structure doesn't allow a double bond, perhaps it forms a carbonyl via some rearrangement. Alternatively, maybe each Br is replaced by an -O- group, leading to an epoxide, but that's for vicinal dihalides. Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane isn't vicinal, so it can't form an epoxide via that reaction. So that's not it.

Wait, another idea: perhaps the dihalide reacts with KOH in a double elimination, but since the structure can't support a double bond, the two leaving groups (Br) are eliminated, and the adjacent carbons form a carbonyl. For example, imagine two CH2Br groups next to each other. Eliminating both Brs would form a double bond, but if that's not possible, perhaps the structure collapses to form a carbonyl. So, for each Br, the H on the adjacent carbon is abstracted by the base, leading to the elimination of Br and the formation of a carbonyl group. So perhaps the product is 1,3-adamantanedione. That would have two ketone groups. But how would that look in the NMR?

Wait, the IR at 1720 could be from a ketone. But the NMR shows 4.79 (2H), which doesn't fit a ketone. Hmm, maybe the 4.79 is from an OCH2 group. So perhaps the product isn't a ketone but an ether. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a secondary alcohol, but then the IR wouldn't show a strong carbonyl.

I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should move to the next steps and see if that helps.

Product 2 is then subjected to ozonolysis at -78Â°C, followed by dimethyl sulfide. Ozonolysis typically cleaves double bonds to form carbonyl groups. So if product 2 has a double bond, product 3 would have carbonyl groups where the double bond was.

But wait, if product 2 is a diene, ozonolysis would break each double bond into two carbonyls. However, ozonolysis conditions vary. At low temperatures (-78Â°C), ozonolysis tends to give aldehydes and ketones without over-oxidizing. If the double bond is in a ring or part of a conjugated system, the cleavage would be specific.

But wait, product 3 is formed after ozonolysis. The question is about the NMR of product 3, specifically the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen, excluding those that exchange.

So, perhaps product 2 has a double bond, and product 3 has carbonyl groups. So in product 3, the H's adjacent to carbonyls would be deshielded. The coupling pattern depends on the neighboring protons.

Wait, product 3's NMR: the most deshielded H would be near an electronegative group, like a carbonyl.

But let me get back. If product 1 has a carbonyl (from IR), and product 2 is formed by heating with Al isopropoxide, which is a Lewis acid catalyst. If product 1 is a ketone, maybe product 2 is an acetal or some kind of enol ether. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an alkene, and product 2 is a diol, but with Al isopropoxide, maybe it's a different reaction.

Wait, perhaps the first reaction is elimination to form a diene. Then, product 1 would be a diene. The NMR then would show peaks corresponding to the diene's protons. But the given NMR for product 1 has 4.79 (2H), which doesn't fit a typical diene's protons.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a cyclopropane derivative, but I'm not sure.

An alternative approach: Let me think about the ozonolysis step. Ozonolysis of a double bond typically yields carbonyl compounds. So if product 2 has a double bond, product 3 would have carbonyls. But the H NMR of product 3 would show the protons adjacent to these carbonyls.

But the question is about product 3's most deshielded H. The most deshielded would be near an electronegative group, like a carbonyl. So those protons are usually around 2-3 ppm? Or higher? Wait, in aldehydes, the H is around 9-10 ppm, which is very deshielded. But if it's a ketone, the alpha protons are around 2.1 ppm, but that's not as deshielded as an aldehyde.

Wait, but the question says "the most deshielded hydrogen atom (excluding those that will exchange with deuterated solvent)". So this could be an aldehyde proton, which is very deshielded. But I don't know if product 3 has aldehyde groups.

Alternatively, the most deshielded could be a vinylic proton, but those are usually in the 4-7 ppm range. Hmm.

Wait, but in the initial reaction, product 1's NMR has 4.79 (2H), which could be a CH2 group next to an oxygen, perhaps in an epoxide or an ether. But then, product 2 is formed by heating with Al isopropoxide. Al isopropoxide is used in Friedel-Crafts acylation and alkylation. So if product 1 is a ketone, then product 2 might be an acylated product.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a diol, and Al isopropoxide reacts with it in some way. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is an epoxide. Let's say the first reaction forms an epoxide. Then, heating with Al isopropoxide could cause the epoxide to undergo some ring-opening, perhaps forming a carbonyl group.

But I'm not making progress. Maybe I should consider the NMR peaks for product 1 again. The NMR shows 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), and 1.94 (2H). Let's see:

The 4.79 ppm (2H) is likely two equivalent protons in an environment that's deshielded. Maybe they're adjacent to an electronegative atom, like oxygen. So perhaps an OCH2 group. The 2.41-2.23 (10H) indicates several equivalent protons, perhaps in a CH2 group adjacent to something. The 1.94 (2H) could be another set of equivalent protons, perhaps in a different environment.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a diether, like a 1,3-dioxolane or something similar. But how would that form from 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH? Maybe via an elimination forming an epoxide, but that would require vicinal Brs, which 1,3-dibromoadamantane doesn't have. So that's unlikely.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is a geminal diol, but that would require each Br to be replaced by an -OH group. But gem-diols aren't very common, and the NMR would show broad peaks for OH, which is not mentioned here.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the KOH is causing an elimination to form a carbonyl group. So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane â 1,3-adamantanedione. Then, the IR would show two strong carbonyl peaks, but the question states a characteristic absorbance at 1720 cm-1, which is a single peak. So maybe it's a single ketone, not two. So perhaps the product is a mono-ketone. But how?

Alternatively, maybe each Br is replaced by an -O- group, but that would form an ether, not a ketone.

Wait, perhaps the product is a secondary alcohol. But then the IR wouldn't show a strong carbonyl peak. So that doesn't fit.

I'm getting stuck here, so perhaps I should look for another approach. Maybe the first reaction is a double elimination, forming a conjugated diene. Then, product 1 is a diene. The NMR would show peaks for the diene's protons. But the NMR given doesn't fit that. Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an alkene, and product 2 is an epoxide, which upon ozonolysis would break into carbonyls.

Wait, but I'm not getting anywhere. Let me think about the options for the NMR coupling.

The question is about product 3's most deshielded H. The options are triplet, triplet of triplets, doublet of triplets, or pentet.

If the most deshielded H is adjacent to two sets of neighboring protons, it might split into a triplet of triplets. Or if it's next to a CH2 group, perhaps a triplet.

Wait, if the deshielded H is part of a CH2 group next to another CH2, it might couple with two protons on each adjacent group, leading to a triplet of triplets or a more complex splitting.

Alternatively, if the H is next to a CH group with two neighboring Hs, it could be a triplet.

But without knowing the structure, it's hard. Maybe I should think about the overall process.

Another approach: The initial reaction forms a diol. Then, product 2 is formed by some reaction with Al isopropoxide, perhaps forming an acetal. Ozonolysis then cleaves double bonds, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is 1,3-adamantanol, but that wouldn't explain the IR peak.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an epoxide. But again, not sure.

Wait, maybe the first reaction is a double elimination, forming a conjugated diene. Then, product 1 is a diene, and the NMR would show peaks for the diene's Hs. The IR at 1720 would then be from somewhere else, but I don't see how.

Wait, the IR at 1720 cm-1 is a strong peak, so perhaps it's a carbonyl, which suggests a ketone or ester. So product 1 is a ketone.

So, product 1 is a ketone. Then, product 2 is formed by heating with Al isopropoxide. Maybe it's a Friedel-Crafts acylation, but adamantane doesn't have aromatic rings. Alternatively, maybe product 1 is a dienone, and product 2 is formed via some cycloaddition.

But I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a carbonyl, and product 2 is an enol ether or something else.

If product 2 has a double bond, then ozonolysis would cleave it into carbonyl groups in product 3. The H NMR of product 3 would then show protons adjacent to these carbonyls.

The most deshielded H in product 3 would be near a carbonyl group. If it's a ketone, the alpha protons are around 2.1 ppm, but if it's an aldehyde, the H is around 9-10 ppm.

Assuming product 3 has aldehyde groups, the H would be very deshielded. But aldehydic protons are typically a singlet because they're adjacent to no other Hs (since RCHO has only one H). Unless the aldehyde is part of a conjugated system, but that's not common.

Alternatively, if product 3 has a conjugated dienone, the Hs adjacent to the carbonyl might be more deshielded and split into certain patterns.

Wait, but I'm not getting anywhere. Let me try to think of the possible structures.

1,3-dibromoadamantane â product 1 (could be a diene or a ketone) â product 2 (possibly a diol or an ether) â product 3 (after ozonolysis, which breaks double bonds into carbonyls).

In product 3, the most deshielded H is likely part of a carbonyl group's adjacent CH2 or CH group.

Assuming product 3 has a structure where a CH2 is next to a carbonyl, the Hs on CH2 would be deshielded. If the CH2 is adjacent to another CH2 group, which is next to a CH group, each H would couple with the neighboring groups.

Alternatively, the H could be part of a CH2 adjacent to two different sets of Hs. For example, a CH2 connected to a carbonyl and another CH2 connected to another group. Then, each H on the CH2 would couple with two Hs from the adjacent CH2 (giving a triplet) and possibly with another group, leading to a triplet of triplets.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, if the H is part of a CH group next to a CH2, it would couple with two Hs, giving a triplet.

Wait, the options are A) triplet, B) triplet of triplets, C) doublet of triplets, D) pentet.

If the most deshielded H is part of a CH2 group adjacent to another CH2, each H would couple with two Hs from the adjacent group. So each H would see two neighboring Hs, leading to a triplet. But if there's another coupling, like from a CH group nearby, it might split further.

Alternatively, if the H is part of a CH group adjacent to a CH2, each H would couple with two Hs, leading to a triplet.

But without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to say. However, considering the options, a triplet of triplets sounds plausible if the H is coupled to two sets of two Hs each, leading to three splits.

Alternatively, if the H is coupled to two Hs on one side and another two Hs on the other, the pattern would be a triplet of triplets.

Wait, another possibility: if the H is adjacent to a CH2 group (two Hs) and another group with two Hs, it would split into a triplet of triplets. For example, if the H is in a structure like CH2-CH2-C=O, the H on the first CH2 would couple with the two Hs on the adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet. But if there's another coupling (like from a neighboring group), it could become a triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, if the H is part of a CH group next to a CH2, which is next to another CH2, the splitting could become more complex.

Wait, maybe product 3 has a structure where the most deshielded H is part of a CH2 adjacent to two different CH2 groups. Each H would couple with two Hs, leading to a triplet. But if there's another coupling, it could become a triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, perhaps the H is part of a CH group adjacent to a CH2 and a CH. Then, the coupling would be with two Hs from the CH2 and one H from the CH, leading to a triplet of doublets or something else. But I'm not sure.

Hmm, this is getting too vague. Maybe I should make an educated guess based on the options. The most common coupling patterns in such situations are triplets or doublets. But the presence of multiple coupling partners could lead to more complex patterns.

In ozonolysis products, especially from symmetric dienes, the resulting carbonyl compounds might have simple structures. For example, if the diene was symmetric, ozonolysis would give two identical carbonyl groups. The Hs adjacent to these would have simple coupling.

Wait, if product 3 has a structure like (CH2)nCO, the Hs on CH2 would couple with each other. For example, a CH2 next to a carbonyl would have two Hs, which would be a triplet if they're next to another CH2 group with two Hs. But without more info, it's tough.

Given the options, I think the most likely answer is a triplet or a triplet of triplets. Considering the possible couplings, perhaps a triplet of triplets (option B) is the answer.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. The first reaction with KOH at 240Â°C likely results in a substitution or elimination reaction. The IR spectrum of the product (product 1) shows a strong absorbance at 1720 cmâ»Â¹, indicating the presence of a carbonyl group, such as a ketone. The Â¹H NMR spectrum of product 1 includes a peak at 4.79 ppm (2H), which suggests the presence of a CHâ group adjacent to an electronegative atom, possibly oxygen. The remaining peaks (2.41-2.23 ppm for 10H and 1.94 ppm for 2H) likely correspond to protons in the adamantane framework.

The second reaction involves heating product 1 with aluminum isopropoxide, a Lewis acid catalyst. This step likely modifies the structure of product 1, potentially forming a compound with a double bond (product 2). The third step involves ozonolysis of product 2 at -78Â°C, followed by the addition of dimethyl sulfide. Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds, forming carbonyl-containing products (product 3). The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is expected to be near a carbonyl group, as carbonyl protons are highly deshielded.

In the Â¹H NMR spectrum of product 3, the most deshielded hydrogen would likely exhibit a coupling pattern influenced by neighboring protons. If the hydrogen is adjacent to two sets of protons (e.g., from two different CHâ groups), it could result in a triplet of triplets. This pattern arises when the hydrogen couples with two protons from one group (producing a triplet) and another two protons from a second group (splitting each of the triplet peaks into two, resulting in a total of six peaks). This matches the description of the coupling pattern for the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3.

Given the options, the most plausible coupling pattern for the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is a triplet of triplets.
