Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let's see what the question is asking.

Alright, the setup is about a star with certain characteristics. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. Without any dark spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric Teff drops to 5500 K. So, when spots cover parts of the star, the overall temperature decreases. That makes sense because the spots are cooler regions, so they would lower the average temperature.

Now, the main part of the question is about the ratio of the number of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels. The ratio is observed to decrease when the star has spots. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star is spotless (no spots) compared to when it has spots.

Hmm. I remember from my studies that the number of atoms in different energy levels in a star's photosphere is governed by the Boltzmann equation under Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). The Boltzmann equation relates the ratio of populations of two energy levels to the temperature and the energy difference between them.

The Boltzmann factor equation is:

n2 / n1 = (g2 / g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1) / (k*T) )

Where:
- n2 and n1 are the number of atoms in levels 2 and 1 respectively.
- g2 and g1 are the statistical weights (degeneracy) of the levels.
- E2 and E1 are the energies of the levels.
- k is Boltzmann's constant.
- T is the temperature.

The problem says that the ratio (n1/n2) decreases when the star has spots. Wait no, wait: the ratio of n1 to n2 is decreasing. So when the star has spots, the ratio is lower. Wait, the ratio is n1/n2. So when the star has spots, n1/n2 is lower than when it doesn't have spots.

Wait, let me double-check. The question says, "when examining the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energetic levels (level 1 and level 2), astronomers have observed that this ratio decreases when the star has spots." So ratio = n1/n2. When the star has spots, this ratio is lower. So in spotless case, the ratio is higher.

Wait, but the question is asking for the factor by which this ratio changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots. So the factor is (n1/n2)_no_spots divided by (n1/n2)_with_spots.

Alternatively, the factor is (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_with_spots = ( (n1/n2)_no_spots ) / ( (n1/n2)_with_spots )

Since T_eff changes, and the ratio depends on T.

Wait, but what's the difference between when the star has spots and doesn't? The overall photospheric temperature is lower when spots are present. So the effective temperature is 6000 K without spots and 5500 K with spots.

But wait, how exactly does this affect the ratio? Because the spots are cooler regions, but the overall photosphere's average temperature drops. Or perhaps the star's atmosphere is at a lower temperature on average.

So, the photosphere's Teff is 5500 K when 40% is covered by spots. So the average T is lower.

Now, the ratio (n1/n2) is given to decrease when spots are present. So, according to the Boltzmann equation, the ratio n1/n2 is proportional to exp( (E2 - E1)/(k*T) ). Because in the equation, n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) ), so n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) )

Wait, wait, let's do that step by step. Let me write the equation again.

n2 / n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

So, rearranged,

n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

So, the ratio n1/n2 is proportional to exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

Wait, but the problem says that when the star has spots, the overall T_eff is lower. So, if T decreases, what happens to the exponent? Let's see.

The transition corresponds to a wavelength of ~1448 Å. I think that's in the near ultraviolet. Titanium lines in that region... But perhaps that's not directly needed here.

Wait, the wavelength is given, but perhaps it's used to find the energy difference between the levels.

The energy difference ΔE can be found using the relation E = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant, c is speed of light, and λ is the wavelength.

So, ΔE = hc / λ.

But wait, wait, which level is higher? The wavelength emitted when an atom transitions from level 2 to level 1 would be λ = hc/(E2 - E1). So if an electron moves from higher to lower energy, it emits a photon with energy ΔE = E2 - E1.

So, E2 > E1, so ΔE is positive.

So, the energy difference is E2 - E1 = hc/(λ), where λ is 1448 Å.

Hmm. So, let's compute ΔE or (E2-E1) in terms of temperature.

But wait, perhaps we can express the ratio (n1/n2) in terms of temperature.

Let me think, the ratio depends on T as exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

So, when the star's T_eff is higher (no spots), the exponent is larger, making the ratio (n1/n2) larger. Because as T increases, (E2 - E1)/(k T) decreases, so exp(...) decreases.

Wait, no: Let's see.

Wait, wait, the exponent is (E2-E1)/(k T). As T increases, the denominator grows, so the exponent becomes smaller.

So, when T is higher, exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) ) becomes smaller.

Wait, so if T increases, the ratio n1/n2 = [g1/g2] * exp(ΔE/(k T)) would decrease, because the exponent's value is getting smaller, so the exponential is lower.

Wait, but in our case, when the star has spots, T_eff is lower (5500 K). So ΔE/(k T) would be higher. So the exponential would be larger, so the ratio n1/n2 would be larger. But the problem states that when the star has spots, the ratio n1/n2 decreases. That's a contradiction unless I've messed up the setup.

Wait, maybe I have the ratio inverted. Let me think again.

The problem says the ratio of n1 to n2 decreases when the star has spots. So (n1/n2)_spots < (n1/n2)_no_spots.

But according to the Boltzmann equation, when T decreases (as in spots case), the exponent (ΔE)/(k T) increases. So exp(ΔE/(k T)) increases, making n1/n2 increase. But the problem says it decreases. Hmm, that's a problem.

Wait, perhaps I got the levels mixed up. Are we considering the ratio n2/n1 or n1/n2?

The problem says the ratio (n1/n2) decreases when the star has spots. So, when the star has spots, this ratio is lower.

Wait, but according to the equation, n1/n2 is proportional to exp(ΔE/(k T)). So when T decreases (spots case), the exponent becomes larger, so exp(...) increases. So n1/n2 increases. But the problem says it decreases. So that's a contradiction.

Hmm, that suggests I might have the ratio backwards. Maybe the observed ratio is n2/n1, not n1/n2. Let me re-read the problem.

The question says, "the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energetic levels (level 1 and level 2)"—so it's n1/n2.

Wait, but the problem states that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. So according to the equation, when T decreases, n1/n2 increases. But the observation is that it decreases. So that can't be right. So perhaps I made a mistake in the equation.

Alternatively, perhaps I got the energy difference backwards. Maybe I should consider E1 - E2.

Wait, let me re-express the Boltzmann equation.

n2 / n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

If E2 > E1, then E2 - E1 is positive. So when T decreases, the exponent becomes more negative (since dividing by a smaller T), so exp(-ΔE/(k T)) becomes smaller. So n2/n1 decreases as T decreases.

Wait, so n2/n1 is proportional to exp(-ΔE/(k T))

So, if T decreases, n2/n1 decreases.

So, n1/n2 would be (n2/n1)^(-1) = [g2/g1 exp(-ΔE/(k T))]^(-1) = (g1/g2) exp(ΔE/(k T)).

Wait, so if T decreases, ΔE/(k T) increases, so exp(ΔE/(k T)) increases. So n1/n2 increases.

But the problem says when the star has spots (T is lower), the ratio n1/n2 decreases.

Hmm, that's not matching our conclusion. There must be something wrong here. Perhaps the observed ratio is n2/n1, not n1/n2?

Wait, the problem says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when T is lower, ratio goes down. Let me see.

If the ratio in question is n2/n1, then according to the equation:

n2/n1 = (g2/g1) exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

So when T decreases, the exponent becomes more negative, so exp(...) becomes smaller. So n2/n1 decreases as T decreases. Which matches the observation that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases.

Wait, that makes sense. So the observed ratio is n2/n1. So I must have misread the problem.

Wait, the question states: "the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energetic levels (level 1 and level 2), astronomers have observed that this ratio decreases when the star has spots."

Wait, so the ratio is level 1 to level 2, n1/n2. So when T decreases, that ratio increases, but the problem says it decreases. So that's the opposite of what the equation says. So that's a problem.

Alternatively, perhaps the way the levels are labeled is different. Maybe level 2 is lower than level 1. Wait, no, because the transition corresponds to a wavelength. If an electron drops from level 2 to level 1, it emits a photon at wavelength λ. If the star emits at that wavelength, then level 2 is higher in energy.

Hmm, this is getting confusing. Maybe I should approach this differently.

Let me assume that the observed ratio is n1/n2. The problem states this ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when T decreases, the ratio n1/n2 decreases.

But according to the equation:

n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp(ΔE/(k T) )

So if T decreases, the exponent increases, so n1/n2 increases. Which contradicts the observation.

So that can't be right. Therefore, perhaps I'm getting the ratio wrong. Maybe the observed ratio is n2/n1, which is (n2/n1) = (g2/g1) exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

In that case, when T decreases, the exponent becomes more negative, so exp(...) becomes smaller. So n2/n1 decreases, matching the observation that the ratio (n2/n1) decreases when the star has spots.

Wait, but the problem states that the ratio (n1/n2) decreases. Hmm. I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps the transition is from level 1 to level 2. So when the electron moves from level 1 to level 2, it absorbs a photon of wavelength 1448 Å. So, in that case, level 2 is higher in energy than level 1. So E2 > E1.

Wait, but when an electron is excited from level 1 to level 2, it requires energy. So the photon emitted when it de-excites is at 1448 Å. So yes, E2 > E1.

So, n2/n1 is proportional to exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), where ΔE = E2 - E1.

So, for higher T, exp( -ΔE/(k T) ) is larger, so n2/n1 is larger, so the ratio n2/n1 increases with T.

When T decreases (spots present), n2/n1 decreases. Which matches what the problem says: the ratio (n2/n1) decreases when the star has spots.

Wait, but the problem says the ratio (n1/n2) decreases, so n2/n1 increases. Wait, perhaps the problem is talking about n2/n1 as the ratio, but phrased as n1/n2. No, the problem says the ratio of n1 to n2, so n1/n2, which is the inverse of n2/n1.

Hmm. So if the observed ratio is n1/n2, which is (g1/g2) exp(ΔE/(k T) ), then as T decreases, the exponent increases, leading to a larger ratio. But the problem says the ratio decreases when T decreases. So that's a contradiction. Which suggests that perhaps I have the energy difference wrong.

Wait, perhaps the transition is from level 2 to level 1, which would emit a photon at 1448 Å. So E2 is higher than E1, so ΔE = E2 - E1 is positive. So if the transition is from 2 to 1, then the photon's energy is E2 - E1 = hc/λ.

Therefore, in the Boltzmann equation, when considering n2/n1, it's exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

So, when T decreases, n2/n1 decreases, as exp( -ΔE/(k T) ) becomes smaller.

So, if the ratio being observed is n2/n1, then when T decreases, the ratio decreases. Which matches the problem's observation. So the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio (n2/n1) decreases.

Wait, but the question says "the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energetic levels (level 1 and level 2)", which is n1/n2. So that's the opposite of what I'm considering. Hmm.

This is getting a bit tangled. Maybe I should think in terms of the ratio (n2/n1) and how it changes, then see what the problem says.

So, when the star has spots, the overall T_eff is lower. So, T is 5500 K with spots, 6000 K without.

The ratio (n2/n1) is proportional to exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

So, let's compute the ratio with and without spots.

Let me compute the ratio (n2/n1)_no_spots / (n2/n1)_with_spots.

Because the problem is asking for the factor by which (n1/n2) changes, which is the inverse of (n2/n1). Hmm.

Wait, let's proceed step by step.

First, compute the ratio when there are no spots (T = 6000 K) and when there are spots (T = 5500 K).

The ratio (n2/n1) is proportional to exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

So,

Factor = [ (n2/n1)_no_spots ] / [ (n2/n1)_with_spots ]

= [ exp( -ΔE/(k * 6000) ) ] / [ exp( -ΔE/(k * 5500) ) ]

= exp( [ -ΔE/(k *6000) + ΔE/(k *5500) ] )

= exp( ΔE/(k) [ 1/(5500) - 1/(6000) ] )

Compute that exponent.

Let me compute the term [1/5500 - 1/6000].

Compute 1/5500 = approximately 0.000181818
1/6000 ≈ 0.000166667

So, 0.000181818 - 0.000166667 ≈ 0.000015151

So, the exponent is ΔE/(k) * 0.000015151

But what's ΔE? Since ΔE = hc/λ.

h is Planck's constant: 6.626e-34 J·s

c is speed of light: 3e8 m/s

λ is 1448 Å = 1448e-10 m = 1.448e-7 m.

So,

ΔE = hc / λ = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1.448e-7) 

Let me compute that.

6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m

Divided by 1.448e-7 m:

ΔE ≈ 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 ≈ 1.373e-18 J.

Now, Boltzmann's constant k is 1.38e-23 J/K.

So,

ΔE/(k) = (1.373e-18 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) ≈ (1.373 / 1.38) * 1e5 ≈ ~0.995e5 ≈ 99500 K.

So, ΔE/(k) ≈ 99500 K.

Now, back to the exponent:

ΔE/(k) * (1/5500 - 1/6000) ≈ 99500 K * (0.000015151) ≈ 

Let me compute 99500 * 0.000015151.

Well, 0.000015151 is approximately 1.5151e-5.

So, 99500 * 1.5151e-5 ≈ (99500 * 1.5151) / 1e5

Compute 99500 * 1.5151:

Approximate 100,000 * 1.5151 = 151,510.

But 99500 is 500 less, so 151,510 - 500 * 1.5151 ≈ 151,510 - 757.55 ≈ 150,752.45

So, 150,752.45 / 1e5 ≈ 1.5075245.

So the exponent is approximately 1.5075.

So the factor is exp(1.5075) ≈ e^1.5075.

We know that e^1 ≈ 2.718, e^1.5 is about 4.4817, e^1.6 is about 4.953.

Wait, let's compute e^1.5075.

Alternatively, since 1.5075 is close to 1.504 (which is ln(4.5)), let me check:

ln(4)=1.386, ln(4.5)=1.504, ln(5)=1.609.

So, 1.5075 is very close to ln(4.5). So e^1.5075 ≈ 4.5.

Wait, but wait, no, because 1.5075 is a bit higher than 1.504.

The exact value of ln(4.5) is approx 1.5040774.

So, 1.5075 is 0.0034226 higher.

The exponential function's value at 1.504 is 4.5.

Compute e^0.0034226 ≈ 1.00343.

So, e^1.5075 ≈ 4.5 * 1.00343 ≈ 4.515.

So, approximately 4.5.

Thus, the factor is approximately 4.5.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. The factor we calculated is [ (n2/n1)_no_spots ] / [ (n2/n1)_with_spots ] = exp(1.5075) ≈ 4.5.

But the problem is asking for the factor by which the ratio (n1/n2) changes. Since (n1/n2) = 1/(n2/n1), the factor would be the inverse.

Wait, no. Let me clarify.

The ratio (n1/n2)_no_spots = [g1/g2] * exp(ΔE/(k T_no_spots))

The ratio (n1/n2)_with_spots = [g1/g2] * exp(ΔE/(k T_spots))

So the factor is (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_with_spots ) = [ exp(ΔE/(k T_no_spots)) ] / [ exp(ΔE/(k T_spots)) ]

Which is exp( ΔE/(k) [ 1/T_no_spots - 1/T_spots ] )

Which is the same as the earlier calculation. Wait a minute, earlier I computed [ (n2/n1)_no_spots ] / [ (n2/n1)_with_spots ] = 4.5.

But the problem is about (n1/n2), so the factor would be [ (n1/n2)_no_spots ] / [ (n1/n2)_with_spots ] = [ (n2/n1)_with_spots ] / [ (n2/n1)_no_spots ] = 1/4.5 ≈ 0.222.

But the problem states that the ratio (n1/n2) decreases when spots are present. So when no spots, (n1/n2) is higher. So the factor is (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_with_spots = 4.5.

Wait, that's not matching. Let me see:

Wait, let me re-express:

(n1/n2) = (g1/g2) exp(ΔE/(k T))

So,

(n1/n2)_no_spots = (g1/g2) exp(ΔE/(k * 6000))

(n1/n2)_with_spots = (g1/g2) exp(ΔE/(k * 5500))

So,

Factor = (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_with_spots = exp(ΔE/(k) [ 1/6000 - 1/5500 ] )

Which is the same as before, but with the signs reversed.

Wait, [1/6000 - 1/5500] = negative value.

Wait, let's compute [1/6000 - 1/5500] = (5500 - 6000)/(6000 *5500) )= (-500)/(33,000,000) )= - (1/66000 )

So,

ΔE/(k) * [1/6000 - 1/5500] = (99500 K) * (-1 / 66000 )

= -99500 / 66000 ≈ -1.5075.

So the exponent is -1.5075, so the factor is exp(-1.5075) ≈ 1 / exp(1.5075) ≈ 1/4.5 ≈ 0.222.

But the problem says that the ratio (n1/n2) decreases when the star has spots. That means (n1/n2)_with_spots < (n1/n2)_no_spots. So the factor is (no spots)/(with spots) = 4.5. Because 0.222 is the inverse.

Wait, no. If (n1/n2)_no = 4.5 * (n1/n2)_with, then the factor is 4.5.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think numerically.

Suppose without spots, T=6000 K, and with spots, T=5500 K.

Compute (n1/n2)_no = (g1/g2) exp(ΔE/(k * 6000))

(n1/n2)_with = (g1/g2) exp(ΔE/(k * 5500))

So, the ratio (n1/n2)_no / (n1/n2)_with = exp(ΔE/(k) (1/6000 - 1/5500) )

= exp( [ΔE/(k)] * (-1/66000) )

Which is exp( - (ΔE/(k)) * (1/66000) )

Wait, but earlier calculation for [1/6000 -1/5500] was = -0.000015151.

Wait, but in our earlier approach, when we computed for (n2/n1), the factor was exp(1.5075) ≈4.5.

So for (n1/n2), the factor would be exp( -1.5075 ) ≈ 0.222.

But that would mean (n1/n2)_no / (n1/n2)_with = 0.222, so (n1/n2)_no = 0.222 * (n1/n2)_with.

Which would imply that (n1/n2)_no is smaller than (n1/n2)_with. But the problem says the opposite: when the star has spots, the ratio (n1/n2) decreases. So (n1/n2)_with < (n1/n2)_no.

Hmm. So according to the calculation, (n1/n2)_no = 0.222 * (n1/n2)_with. That would mean (n1/n2)_no is smaller than (n1/n2)_with. Which is the opposite of what the problem says.

This suggests that perhaps the ratio being considered is (n2/n1), not (n1/n2). Because when considering (n2/n1), the factor is 4.5, which would mean (n2/n1)_no is 4.5 times (n2/n1)_with. Which would imply that (n2/n1)_no > (n2/n1)_with, which is consistent with the observation that (n1/n2)_no > (n1/n2)_with.

Wait, I'm getting myself in circles. Let me think in terms of what the problem states.

Problem says that when the star has spots, (n1/n2) decreases. So (n1/n2)_with < (n1/n2)_no.

So, the factor (n1/n2)_no / (n1/n2)_with is greater than 1.

But according to the calculation, it's 0.222, which is less than 1. So that's a contradiction. Therefore, perhaps the problem is considering the inverse ratio.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake earlier in the sign.

Wait, let me go back.

The factor for (n2/n1) is (n2/n1)_no / (n2/n1)_with = exp(1.5075) ≈4.5.

So, (n2/n1)_no =4.5 * (n2/n1)_with.

Which implies that (n2/n1) is higher when the star has no spots.

Thus, (n2/n1)_no > (n2/n1)_with.

Which means (n1/n2)_no < (n1/n2)_with.

Because (n1/n2) is the inverse of (n2/n1).

Wait, but the problem says that (n1/n2) decreases when the star has spots. So (n1/n2)_with < (n1/n2)_no.

Which is not the case based on this calculation. So this is confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the ratio (n1/n2) is not what I think. Maybe I'm missing a factor of (g1/g2).

But in the problem, it says to assume the photosphere is in LTE. So the ratio depends on the temperatures and the statistical weights.

Wait, but the problem says that the observed ratio (n1/n2) decreases when the star has spots. So, when T decreases, (n1/n2) decreases.

Which would require that (n1/n2) is inversely proportional to T. Because as T decreases, (n1/n2) decreases.

But according to the Boltzmann equation, (n1/n2) is proportional to exp(ΔE/(k T)).

Which is an increasing function of T because as T increases, the exponent becomes smaller, so exp(...) decreases. Wait, no.

Wait, if T increases, ΔE/(k T) decreases, so exp(ΔE/(k T)) decreases. So (n1/n2) would decrease as T increases.

Which is the opposite of the problem's observation.

Hmm. So perhaps the ratio is (n2/n1), which is proportional to exp(-ΔE/(k T)), which decreases as T increases.

So, when T increases, (n2/n1) decreases, which would mean (n1/n2) increases.

But the problem says that when T decreases (spots), (n1/n2) decreases.

So perhaps the problem is considering (n2/n1), which would decrease as T decreases, leading to (n1/n2) increasing.

But this is getting too tangled. Let me try to summarize.

The problem states that (n1/n2) decreases when the star has spots (lower T). According to the Boltzmann equation, (n1/n2) is proportional to exp(ΔE/(k T)).

As T decreases, exp(ΔE/(k T)) increases, so (n1/n2) increases. But the problem says (n1/n2) decreases when T decreases. This is a contradiction unless perhaps the energy difference is negative, which would imply E1 > E2.

But that would mean that the photon emitted when moving from level 1 to level 2 has a negative energy, which is impossible.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is referring to the ionization state. Wait, no, the question specifies neutral atoms.

Alternatively, perhaps the line is formed in a region where temperature inversion occurs. But the problem states that the photosphere is in LTE, so that shouldn't be the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the observed ratio is (n2/n1), and the problem says that this ratio decreases when spots are present, which matches our earlier calculation where (n2/n1)_no / (n2/n1)_with =4.5. So the factor is 4.5, which is option C.

But the problem asks for the factor of (n1/n2). So if (n2/n1) increases by 4.5, then (n1/n2) decreases by a factor of 4.5.

Wait, no. Let me think. If (n2/n1) increases by a factor of F when the star has no spots compared to when it has spots, then (n1/n2) would decrease by the same factor F.

Because (n1/n2) = 1/(n2/n1). So, if (n2/n1) is multiplied by F, then (n1/n2) is divided by F.

So, in the case where (n2/n1)_no = F * (n2/n1)_with, then (n1/n2)_no = (n1/n2)_with / F.

So, the factor (n1/n2)_no / (n1/n2)_with = 1/F.

But earlier, for (n2/n1), the factor is F=4.5, so for (n1/n2), the factor is 1/4.5 ≈ 0.222.

But that would mean (n1/n2) decreases by a factor of 4.5, which is what the problem states.

Wait, perhaps the problem is phrased as the ratio (n1/n2) decreases, so the factor is (n1/n2)_no / (n1/n2)_with = F.

But according to our calculation, for (n1/n2), F would be exp( [ΔE/(k) (1/6000 -1/5500) ]) = exp( -1.5075 ) ≈ 0.222.

Which is approximately 0.22. But none of the options are near that. The options are A) ~1.1, B) ~7.8, C) ~4.5, D) ~2.9.

Wait, but our earlier calculation for (n2/n1) gave a factor of 4.5. So if the problem is about (n1/n2), perhaps the factor is the inverse.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Let me think differently.

The problem is asking for the factor by which the ratio (n1/n2) changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots. So it's (n1/n2)_no / (n1/n2)_with = ?

We calculated for (n2/n1)_no / (n2/n1)_with = 4.5.

Which would mean (n2/n1)_no =4.5 * (n2/n1)_with.

So, (n1/n2)_no = 1/(4.5 * (n2/n1)_with ) = (1/4.5) * (n1/n2)_with.

Which means (n1/n2)_no = (n1/n2)_with /4.5.

So, (n1/n2)_no / (n1/n2)_with = 1/4.5 ≈ 0.222. But the problem says that when the star has spots, (n1/n2) decreases. So, (n1/n2)_no would be larger than (n1/n2)_with, implying the factor is >1, but according to this, it's 0.222, which is <1.

This is a contradiction. So perhaps I'm miscalculating the factor.

Alternatively, perhaps I have the equation in reverse.

Wait, let me think about the factor again. The factor is (n1/n2)_no / (n1/n2)_with.

Which, using the Boltzmann equation, is:

exp(ΔE/(k T_no) ) / exp(ΔE/(k T_with) ) = exp(ΔE/(k) (1/T_no - 1/T_with ) )

Which is exp( (ΔE/k) (1/6000 - 1/5500) )

Which is exp( (99500) * ( (1/6000) - (1/5500) ) )

Compute 1/6000 ≈ 1.6667e-4, 1/5500 ≈ 1.8182e-4.

So, 1/6000 -1/5500 ≈ (1.6667-1.8182)e-4 ≈ (-0.1515)e-4 = -1.515e-5.

So,

ΔE/(k) * (1/T_no -1/T_with) ≈ 99500 * (-1.515e-5) ≈ 99500 * (-0.00001515) ≈ -1.5075.

So, exp(-1.5075) ≈ 0.222.

So, the factor is 0.222, which is approximately 0.22.

But none of the options are near that. The options are all above 1 except option A, which is 1.1.

Hmm. So perhaps I'm making a wrong assumption here.

Wait, perhaps the transition is from level 1 to level 2, but in the star's atmosphere, the excitation is lower when the temperature is lower, so more atoms are in the lower state.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the energy levels in terms of excitation. When the temperature is higher, more excitation, so more atoms are in the higher level, so n2 increases and n1 decreases, making (n1/n2) decrease.

Wait, so if T increases, (n1/n2) decreases.

In our case, without spots, T is higher (6000 K) than with spots (5500 K).

So, (n1/n2)_no = (n1/n2)_with * exp( [ΔE/(k) (1/6000 - 1/5500) ] )

Which is (n1/n2)_with * exp(-1.5075) ≈ (n1/n2)_with * 0.222.

So, (n1/n2)_no ≈ 0.222 * (n1/n2)_with.

Which means (n1/n2) is lower when there are no spots. But the problem says that when there are spots, (n1/n2) decreases. So (n1/n2)_with < (n1/n2)_no. Which would mean (n1/n2)_no > (n1/n2)_with.

But according to the calculation, (n1/n2)_no = 0.222 * (n1/n2)_with, which is smaller. So this doesn't match the problem's statement.

I must be missing something here. Let me try to go back to the problem statement.

The problem says that when spots are present, the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500 K. So the average T is lower.

The observed ratio (n1/n2) decreases when the star has spots. So, when the star has spots, (n1/n2) is lower than when it doesn't.

Thus, (n1/n2)_no / (n1/n2)_with is the factor we're looking for. And this factor must be greater than 1 because (n1/n2)_no is larger.

But according to our calculation, this factor is 0.222, which is less than 1. Which contradicts the problem's information.

So, perhaps there's an error in the way I'm approaching the problem. Maybe I should compute the ratio the other way.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio is (n2/n1), which decreases when T decreases. So, when spots are present, (n2/n1)_with is lower than (n2/n1)_no.

Thus, the factor (n2/n1)_no / (n2/n1)_with is 4.5.

But the problem is about (n1/n2), so the factor would be the inverse, which is 1/4.5 ≈ 0.222. But again, that doesn't match.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for (n2/n1)_no / (n2/n1)_with, which is 4.5, so the factor is 4.5, which is option C.

But the problem says the ratio (n1/n2) decreases. So, if the factor is 4.5, then (n1/n2) would have a factor of 1/4.5.

But the options don't have 0.222. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe I should compute the ratio the other way.

Let me consider (n1/n2)_with / (n1/n2)_no.

Which would be 1/(0.222) ≈4.5.

But the problem says that (n1/n2) decreases when the star has spots, which implies (n1/n2)_with < (n1/n2)_no.

So, (n1/n2)_no / (n1/n2)_with = factor = 1/0.222 ≈4.5.

Which is option C.

Ah! So that makes sense.

Because when the star has spots, (n1/n2) is lower, so (n1/n2)_no is higher than (n1/n2)_with.

Thus, the factor is (n1/n2)_no / (n1/n2)_with = 4.5.

So the correct answer is C) ~4.5.

Astronomers are studying a star with a 1.5 solar radius and 1.1 solar masses. The star's effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K when its surface is not covered by dark spots, but it decreases to 5500 K when 40% of the surface is covered by spots. The problem involves determining the factor by which the ratio of the number of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2) changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots. The transition between these levels corresponds to a wavelength of approximately 1448 Å, and the stellar photosphere is assumed to be in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE).

The ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels is governed by the Boltzmann equation:

\[
\frac{n_2}{n_1} = \frac{g_2}{g_1} \exp\left(-\frac{E_2 - E_1}{kT}\right),
\]

where \(n_2\) and \(n_1\) are the populations of levels 2 and 1, \(g_2\) and \(g_1\) are their statistical weights, \(E_2 - E_1 = \Delta E\) is the energy difference, \(k\) is Boltzmann's constant, and \(T\) is the temperature. The ratio of interest is \(n_1/n_2\), which is the inverse of \(n_2/n_1\):

\[
\frac{n_1}{n_2} = \frac{g_1}{g_2} \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{kT}\right).
\]

The energy difference \(\Delta E\) is calculated using the wavelength of the transition:

\[
\Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda},
\]

where \(h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}\) is Planck's constant, \(c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}\) is the speed of light, and \(\lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å} = 1.448 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m}\). Substituting these values:

\[
\Delta E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3 \times 10^8)}{1.448 \times 10^{-7}} \approx 1.373 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J}.
\]

Using Boltzmann's constant \(k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K}\), the ratio \(\Delta E / k\) is:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} = \frac{1.373 \times 10^{-18}}{1.38 \times 10^{-23}} \approx 99500 \, \text{K}.
\]

The factor by which the ratio \(n_1/n_2\) changes is given by:

\[
\text{Factor} = \frac{\left(\frac{n_1}{n_2}\right)_{\text{no spots}}}{\left(\frac{n_1}{n_2}\right)_{\text{with spots}}} = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_{\text{no spots}}} - \frac{1}{T_{\text{with spots}}}\right)\right).
\]

Substituting \(T_{\text{no spots}} = 6000 \, \text{K}\) and \(T_{\text{with spots}} = 5500 \, \text{K}\):

\[
\text{Factor} = \exp\left(99500 \left(\frac{1}{6000} - \frac{1}{5500}\right)\right).
\]

First, calculate the temperature term:

\[
\frac{1}{6000} - \frac{1}{5500} = \frac{5500 - 6000}{6000 \times 5500} = \frac{-500}{33000000} \approx -1.515 \times 10^{-5}.
\]

Thus:

\[
\text{Factor} = \exp\left(99500 \times (-1.515 \times 10^{-5})\right) = \exp(-1.5075) \approx 0.222.
\]

This result indicates that the ratio \(n_1/n_2\) decreases by a factor of approximately 4.5 when the star has spots compared to when it does not. Since the problem asks for the factor by which \(n_1/n_2\) changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots, the factor is the inverse of 0.222, which is approximately 4.5.

Thus, the correct answer is:
