Okay, so I've got this problem about identifying an unknown compound using various spectroscopic techniques. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it slowly.

The question gives me the results from FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. My goal is to figure out the chemical formula from the options given.

First, let's look at the FTIR data. The spectrum shows a very broad peak around 3000 cm^-1. I remember that broad peaks in the IR around 3000 usually indicate O-H stretching. Like in alcohols or maybe carboxylic acids. But wait, if it's a very broad peak, could it be an alcohol's O-H? Or maybe a carboxylic acid, which has a very broad and strong O-H stretch. Hmm.

Then there are two other strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. The peak at 1700 is a strong indicator of a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe a carboxylic acid. The 1650 peak might be another carbonyl or maybe an aromatic ring with conjugated double bonds. Alternatively, maybe an amide? But the options don't have nitrogen, so probably not.

Wait, 1650 could also be the stretching of conjugated carbonyl groups, like in a conjugated ester or something with aromatic rings. Oh, wait, that might be the C=O stretching in something like an aromatic ketone? Or perhaps it's a C=C stretch. Wait, no, C=C is usually around 1600-1650. But the 1700 is definitely a carbonyl.

So combining these, what functional groups do we have? If there's a broad O-H (like in a carboxylic acid), then the 1700 might be a carbonyl, which fits. Alternatively, if it's an alcohol, maybe with a conjugated carbonyl. Wait, but the 1650 could be an aromatic ring, like in an aromatic ester or ketone. Hmm.

Next, the 1H NMR shows peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones on a double bond, like in an alkene. So that means the molecule has a double bond, probably an alkene. So, presence of a double bond.

Looking at the mass spectrum, a fragment peak at m/z =45. Hmm, 45 is a common mass. Let's think about what fragments could give that. 45 could correspond to a (CH3)2O group, but wait, (CH3)2O is 30 (15*2 + 16? No, wait 12*2 + 1*6 + 16 = 24 +6+16=46? No, wait, maybe I'm mixing. Alternatively, 45 could be a CH2O fragment, like formaldehyde? No, that's 30. Or maybe a CO2 group? Wait, 44 is CO2, but 45 is maybe (CH2) something. Alternatively, it could be a methyl group attached to something else. Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is (CH3)CO, but that would be 58? Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should consider what the molecular formulas are and see which could give a fragment of 45.

The options are:

A) C6H12O2
B) C6H10O
C) C6H10O2
D) C6H12O

So, let me think about each possible formula and their possible structures.

FTIR: O-H (so at least one O is present as O-H). Also, a carbonyl group (so another O in the formula). Wait, but the options have varying O counts.

Looking at the options:

A) C6H12O2: two oxygen atoms. Possible functional groups could be a carboxylic acid (since O-H and a carbonyl). For example, a benzoic acid derivative. But wait, considering the NMR has vinyl hydrogens. So maybe a substituted benzene ring with a carboxylic acid group and a double bond?

Alternatively, maybe an ester. Esters have a carbonyl group and an O elsewhere. But would an ester have an O-H? No, unless it's an ester with an alcohol group elsewhere, but that's less likely. Alternatively, maybe a ketone and an alcohol, but that would require two O's.

Wait, the O-H could be from an alcohol and the carbonyl from a ketone. Or maybe a hemiacetal or something else.

But let's get back to the IR. The two strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. If it's a carbonyl, 1700 is probably a C=O. The 1650 could be a conjugated carbonyl, or maybe an aromatic ring. Or perhaps it's an ester. Wait, esters typically have a strong C=O around 1740-1700, but if it's conjugated, it could be lower. Wait, maybe it's a conjugated ester, so the C=O is around 1700, and the 1650 is another group, like an aromatic ring's C=C.

Looking at the options again. The molecular formulas:

Option A: C6H12O2. The degree of unsaturation can be calculated. Degree of unsaturation (DoU) is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no X or N, it's (2*6 +2 -12 -0)/2 = (14-12)/2=1. So one degree of unsaturation, which could be a ring or a double bond. But wait, the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, so a double bond. So DoU must account for that.

Wait, let me calculate DoU properly. For each option:

Option A: C6H12O2. H=12. DoU = (2*6 +2 -12 -0)/2 = (14-12)/2=1. So one DoU. But the NMR shows vinyl H, so a double bond (1 DoU) and possibly a ring? Wait, but one DoU can't account for both. So maybe it's a ring plus a double bond. Or perhaps the O's are in a way that they don't add any DoU.

Wait, another way: O's don't add to DoU. So if the molecule has a double bond, that's one, and maybe a ring (like a cyclohexane), that's another DoU. So total DoU would be 2. But for option A, DoU is 1. So that's a problem. So either I'm miscalculating or maybe the structure is different.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me recalculate:

DoU formula is (2C + 2 - H - X + N)/2.

For A: C=6, H=12, O=2.

So (2*6 +2 -12)/2 = (14-12)/2 = 1. So 1 DoU. So it can be a ring or a double bond. But the NMR shows vinyl H, so a double bond is present. So that would account for one DoU. But if there's a ring, that would require another DoU, which isn't present. So perhaps the structure isn't a ring but another double bond. Wait, unless the O's are part of a functional group that doesn't require a DoU. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure has one double bond and no rings. That would fit the DoU of 1.

Wait, but the NMR shows vinyl H, which implies a double bond. So maybe the structure has a double bond and an oxygen-containing group that doesn't contribute to DoU, like an ether or something else. But I'm getting a bit stuck.

Next, looking at the mass spectrum. The fragment at 45 m/z. Let me think about possible fragments. For example, if the molecule has a methyl group attached to an oxygen, like OCH3, that would have a fragment. Alternatively, a ketone group might lose some parts.

Wait, 45 is the mass of CH3COOH minus some? Wait, CH3COOH is 60. No. Wait, 45 could be a fragment like (CH2)2O, but wait, that would be 46 (12*2 + 2*2 + 16 = 24 +4 +16=44, no, maybe not). Alternatively, 45 is C3H7O+, but not sure. Alternatively, it could be a carbonyl group with some attached.

Alternatively, the molecular formula could be something that when fragmented, a CH3O group (31?), but that's not 45. Hmm.

Alternatively, 45 could be a (CH2)2CO group? Wait, (CH2)2CO would be (24 +12 +16) = 52? No. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is CH2CH2O, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a (CH3)2O group, which is 46 (12*2 + 6 +16= 24+6+16=46). Close to 45, but not exact. Maybe another approach.

Wait, perhaps the molecular formula is C6H10O2 (option C). Let me check its DoU.

For option C: C=6, H=10, O=2.

DoU: (2*6 +2 -10)/2 = (14-10)/2=2.

So two DoU. That could be a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds, or a ring and a triple bond, but more likely a ring and a double bond.

If the structure has a ring (like benzene) and a carbonyl group, that would fit. Benzene is three DoU (three double bonds), but wait, benzene is a ring with three double bonds, which counts as 4 DoU (since a ring is 1, each double bond is another). Hmm, maybe I should think differently.

Wait, no, the DoU is calculated per molecule. Each ring or double bond is one DoU. So benzene has 3 rings (no, wait, benzene is a six-membered ring with three double bonds, so it's one ring (1 DoU) plus three double bonds? No, no—each ring or each double bond is one DoU. Benzene has three double bonds but is a single ring, so the DoU is 4 (1 for the ring, 3 for each double bond? No, I think each ring is one, each double bond is one. So benzene has three double bonds and one ring, but actually, the ring and double bonds are all part of the same structure. So the DoU for benzene is 4: 1 for the ring, 3 for the double bonds? No, wait, that doesn't make sense. Actually, the DoU for benzene is 4 because it's a six-membered ring with three double bonds: each double bond is a DoU, plus the ring is a ring (another DoU)? No, wait, that's not how it works. Each ring or each double bond is a DoU. So benzene has three double bonds and one ring, totaling four DoU. But that's more than the two DoU in option C. So perhaps the molecule isn't benzene.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is a cyclohexene ring, which has one ring and one double bond, totaling two DoU. That matches option C's DoU of two. So a cyclohexene ring would fit that.

But then, the FTIR shows a carbonyl. So maybe the ring has a substituent like a ketone or an ester group. For example, cyclohexene with a ketone substituent.

But let's tie it all together. The FTIR has O-H (so maybe an alcohol or a carboxylic acid), and a carbonyl. So if the molecule is a cyclic ester (like a lactone), that would have both a carbonyl and an ether linkage, but would that have an O-H? No, lactones are cyclic esters, so they don't have an O-H unless it's an open structure.

Alternatively, maybe it's a substituted cyclohexene with a carbonyl group and an alcohol group. For example, cyclohexenol with a ketone substituent. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the FTIR shows a broad peak at 3000 cm-1, which is O-H. So maybe it's a diol? No, because the IR would show a broad peak, but the options don't have that many O's. Let me see the options again.

Option C: C6H10O2. So two oxygen atoms. So possible functional groups could be a ketone and an alcohol, or an ester and an alcohol, or a carboxylic acid and an alcohol. Wait, but the IR has a carbonyl, so a ketone and an alcohol? Or ester and something else.

Alternatively, the molecule could be a substituted benzaldehyde with an alcohol group. But then again, the NMR has vinyl H, so maybe it's a double bond in the ring.

Wait, back to the mass spectrum. The fragment at m/z=45. Let me think about possible structures that when broken apart, a fragment of 45 is formed. For example, a common fragment is the methyl group attached to something. Let's think about the possible molecular formula.

If the molecular formula is C6H10O2 (option C), the molecular weight would be (6*12)+(10*1)+(2*16)=72+10+32=114 g/mol. So the molecular ion would be around 114. But the fragment is at 45, which is about 40% of 114. Maybe a fragment like a CH2COO group (which is 58?), not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is a (CH2)2O group, which is 44 (12*2 + 2*2 +16=24 +4 +16=44). Close to 45. Could be a (CH2)2O+ ion, but that's 44. Alternatively, maybe a methyl group attached to something else.

Wait, another thought: the O-H in the IR is broad, which is typical for carboxylic acids. So if the compound is a carboxylic acid, then the formula would have a COOH group. For example, benzoic acid is C7H6O2, but our options have C6. So maybe a substituted benzoic acid, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a di-substituted carboxylic acid. But again, the options don't have that.

Wait, another angle: the NMR has vinyl H, so the molecule has a double bond. So the structure must include an alkene. So, perhaps the molecule has a conjugated dienone or something similar.

Wait, but let's look at each option's possible structures.

Option D: C6H12O. DoU is (2*6 +2 -12)/2=(14-12)/2=1. So one DoU, which would be a ring or a double bond. But the NMR shows vinyl H, so a double bond, so that's accounted for. But then, what's the other O? It would be an alcohol (since O-H is present). So maybe a cyclic ether with an alcohol? No, cyclic ethers don't have O-H. Alternatively, a di-substituted alcohol with a double bond. But I'm not sure.

Wait, mass spectrum for option D: molecular weight is (6*12)+(12*1)+(16)=72+12+16=100. So m/z=100. If the fragment is at 45, which is about half. Maybe a (CH2)2O fragment? But that's 44. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe a CH2CH2O group, which is 44 again. Not 45.

Option B: C6H10O. DoU is (2*6 +2 -10)/2= (14-10)/2=2. So two DoU: could be a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds. So perhaps a cyclohexene ring with an alcohol group. But then, what about the IR peaks?

Wait, the IR has a carbonyl. If option B is C6H10O, that's one O. So maybe a ketone (which has a carbonyl) and the O-H would be from an alcohol. Wait, but that would require two O's. Oh, wait, no. The compound would need another O for the carbonyl. Wait, no. If the formula is C6H10O, then it's only one O. So how can it have both a ketone (which is C=O) and an O-H group (alcohol)? That would require at least two O's. So that's a problem. So option B can't be the case because it only has one O. Because the IR shows both a carbonyl and an O-H stretch, the compound must have at least two O's. So options B is out.

So options left are A, C, D.

Option A: C6H12O2. One DoU. So either a ring or a double bond. But the NMR shows vinyl H, so a double bond. So that's accounted for. So the other DoU is accounted for by the double bond. Wait, no: the DoU is (2C+2 - H)/2. For A: (14-12)/2=1. So one DoU. But if the molecule has a double bond (1 DoU), then there's no room for a ring. So if it's C6H12O2, and it has a double bond, that's one DoU. So the other part must be two O's but no rings. Hmm, but the IR has a carbonyl, so perhaps the structure is a cyclic ester (lactone) with an O-H group? No, because cyclic esters are lactones, which don't have O-H unless it's a hemiacetal or something, which I'm not sure about.

Alternatively, maybe it's a substituted cyclohexene with an ester group. But not sure.

Option C: C6H10O2. DoU is 2. So it could be a ring plus a double bond. For example, a cyclohexene ring with a carbonyl group. So maybe a cyclohexenone. But then, where is the O-H? Because the IR has a broad O-H. So cyclohexenone would have a carbonyl group but no O-H. So perhaps another group. Maybe a hydroxyl group attached.

Wait, if it's cyclohexenol (a cyclohexene ring with an -OH group), that would have an O-H (broad peak), a double bond (so vinyl H in NMR), and the carbonyl? No, cyclohexenol doesn't have a carbonyl. So maybe a cyclohexenone with an alcohol group. But that would require two O's: one for the ketone (C=O) and one for the alcohol (O-H). So that would fit option C's formula (C6H10O2).

Wait, cyclohexenone would have the structure (cyclohexene ring with a ketone group). Its formula would be C6H10O. So with one O. But option C has two O's. So if there's another hydroxyl group, then the formula becomes C6H10O2. So a cyclohexenone with an -OH group attached elsewhere. Then, the IR would show O-H (broad) and the C=O (sharp). That fits. The NMR would show vinyl H from the double bond in the ring. The mass spectrum's fragment at 45 could be from a (CH2)2O group or something.

Alternatively, it could be a substituted cyclohexene with both a ketone and an alcohol substituent.

Now, the mass spectrum fragment at 45. Let's think about the molecular formula again. If the molecular formula is C6H10O2 (option C), then the molecular weight is 6*12 +10 + 32=72+10+32=114. So the molecular ion is at 114. The fragment at 45 is about a third of that. Possible fragments could be (CH3)2CO (which is 58?), but that's not 45.

Wait, 45 is the same as (CH3)COO- would be 59. Hmm.

Another approach: 45 could be the mass of a (CH2)2CO+ ion. Wait, (CH2)2CO is C3H4O. The molecular weight is (3*12) +4 +16=36+4+16=56. Not 45. Hmm.

Wait, 45. Let me think of what's 45. The molecular formula for 45 is C3H7O.

Wait, C3H7O has a molecular weight of (3*12)+(7)+(16)=36+7+16=59. No, that's not 45. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's a CH2O group. CH2O is formaldehyde, but that's 30. No.

Wait, perhaps it's a combination of a CO group. CO is 28. Maybe a CO attached to something else. Alternatively, maybe the fragment is a (CH2)CO group, which is 44 (12*2 + 2 +16=24+2+16=42 no, wait, 12*2=24, 2 H's=2, O=16. 24+2+16=42. Not 45.

Wait, perhaps the fragment is (CH3)COO-. So that would be 59. No. Alternatively, maybe (CH2)COO- is 58.

Alternatively, maybe it's a (CH3)2O group, which is 46. Close to 45. So if the molecular formula is C6H10O2, perhaps the molecule has a (CH3)2O group as part of the structure. For example, maybe an acetate ester attached to a ring.

Wait, another angle: looking at the mass spectrum, the fragment at 45 is a significant peak. Let's think about common fragments. The tropylium ion (C7H7+) is 91, but that's not relevant here. Alternatively, the CH2=CH2 (ethylene) is 28. Hmm.

Wait, I'm getting stuck on the mass spectrum part. Let me try another approach. Let me think about the possible functional groups based on the IR and NMR data.

The IR has O-H (broad), C=O (1700), and another peak at 1650. The NMR has vinyl H, so a double bond. So possible structures could be a dienone, or a cyclohexenol with a carbonyl group.

Wait, another possibility: the compound is an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone. That would have a conjugated double bond and a carbonyl. The IR would show C=O around 1700 and the conjugated double bond around 1650. But then where is the O-H? Oh, maybe an enol form, but that might not show a broad O-H.

Alternatively, the compound is a substituted cinnamic acid. Cinnamic acid has a benzene ring, a double bond, and a carboxylic acid group. Its IR would show O-H (broad and strong), C=O around 1700, and the double bond in the IR as well. The NMR would have peaks for the aromatic protons and the vinyl protons.

But the molecular formula for cinnamic acid is C9H8O2. Our options are C6, so perhaps a smaller version. Maybe something like acrylic acid derivatives, but then the molecular formula wouldn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a methyl vinyl ketone with an alcohol group. But I'm not sure.

Wait, considering the options, let's go back to the mass spectrum. If the fragment is 45, which is m/z=45, what could that be? Let's think about the possible groups.

Another approach: molecular formula for option C is C6H10O2. Let's write the formula as C6H10O2. Let's see if this can be broken into a fragment of 45.

C6H10O2 can be thought of as (C3H5O) + (C3H5O). Hmm, not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a (CH2)2O group, which would have a mass of 44. Then, perhaps another fragment is 44. But the given fragment is 45, which is one higher. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: the fragment could be a (CH3)CO group. (CH3)CO has a mass of 12*2 + 3*1 +16=24 +3 +16=43. Close to 45, but not quite.

Alternatively, maybe a (CH2)COO group. That would be 12*2 + 2*1 +16 +16=24 +2 +32=58. No.

Alternatively, maybe a (CH3)O group is 31. Not 45.

Wait, perhaps the fragment is a (CH2)2CO+ ion. (CH2)2CO is C3H4O. So 3*12=36, 4 H's=4, 16=16. Total 56. Not 45.

Hmm. Maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think about common losses or gains in mass.

In mass spectrometry, common losses include water (18), CO (28), or CH3 (15). But 45 isn't one of these. Alternatively, maybe it's a CH2O group attached to something else.

Wait, another thought: 45 is the molecular weight of (CH3)2CO (acetone). Acetone's molecular weight is 58. No, that's not right. Wait, 45 is the same as (CH2)2O (44) plus one. Not matching.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is a (CH3)COOH group, but that's 60. No.

Wait, what about something like CH2CH2O (1-pentene oxide or something)? No, 45 is 45.

Wait, maybe the fragment is (CH3)COO- as a radical. (CH3)COO is 59, but perhaps losing some H?

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is a C3H7O+ group. C3H7O has a mass of 59. Not matching.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the IR and NMR again.

The presence of vinyl H suggests a double bond. The IR's 1700 peak is a carbonyl. So maybe it's an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester or ketone. The O-H is from an alcohol or carboxylic acid.

Wait, if the compound is an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester, like methyl acrylate. But methyl acrylate would have a structure like CH2=CHCOOCH3. Its formula is C4H6O2. But our options are C6. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the compound is a di-substituted ester with a double bond elsewhere. So, for example, something like CH2=CHCOO-R, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a bicyclic compound, but that might complicate things.

Wait, going back to the options. Let's see each option's possible structures and see which could fit all the data.

Option C is C6H10O2. DoU is 2. So options for structure: a cyclohexene ring (1 DoU) and a carbonyl group (1 DoU). So perhaps cyclohexenone. But cyclohexenone has formula C6H10O. So to get C6H10O2, perhaps it's cyclohexenone with an additional hydroxyl group. So, cyclohexenol with a ketone. But wait, cyclohexenol would have an -OH group and a double bond. Adding a ketone would give another O. So the formula would be C6H10O2.

In that case, the IR would show O-H (broad) and the C=O (sharp). The 1H NMR would show the vinyl H from the double bond. The mass spectrum fragment at 45 could be from a part of the molecule, like the ketone group. For example, a (CH2)2CO fragment. That would have a mass of 12*2 + 2 +16=24+2+16=42, but that's not 45.

Alternatively, maybe when the molecule fragments, it loses a (CH3)2CO group, but that's 58. Hmm.

Another possibility: if the molecule is a diethyl acetal or something, but I don't think that's the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the mass fragment is from a (CH2)COO group. Let me calculate that: (CH2)COO is C2H3O2. 2*12=24, 3=3, 32=32. Total 24+3+32=59. Not 45.

Wait, maybe it's a propionyl group, like CH2CH2CO. That would be C3H5O. 3*12=36, 5=5, 16=16. Total 57. Not 45.

Hmm. Maybe I should think about the molecular formula and the possible structures again.

Option A: C6H12O2. DoU is 1. So either a ring or a double bond. But NMR shows a double bond, so that's accounted for. So the structure could be a substituted cyclohexene with an ester group. For example, a cyclohexene ring with an ester substituent. So, something like O-CO-O-R. But then the O's would be accounted for.

But wait, the ester group has a carbonyl, which fits the IR's 1700 peak. The O-H in the IR would have to come from somewhere else, but if it's an ester, there's no O-H. So that's a problem. So, option A might not fit because the IR has an O-H.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure has a hydroxyl group and an ester group, but that would require three O's, which option A doesn't have. So that's not possible.

Hmm.

Another approach: Let's think about the molecular formula and possible possible structures.

Looking for a structure with O-H, a carbonyl group, a double bond, and the molecular formula.

Option C: C6H10O2.

Possible structure: cyclohexenone with an -OH group. So, 6 carbons in the ring, one double bond (from cyclohexene), one ketone (C=O), and an -OH. That would make the formula C6H10O2.

In that case, the IR would show O-H (broad) and C=O (sharp around 1700). The NMR would show vinyl H from the double bond. The mass spectrum fragment at 45 could be from the ketone part. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the molecule is a substituted acrylic acid. For example, acrylic acid is CH2=CHCOOH, which is C3H4O2. But our options are C6. So perhaps a dimer or a larger structure.

Wait, another possibility: the compound is a substituted benzaldehyde with an alcohol group. Benzaldehyde has a benzene ring and a CHO group. If there's an -OH group attached, the formula would be C7H6O2, but our options are C6.

So that might not fit.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a diethyl maleate or something, but again, not matching the molecular formula.

Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclic ester with an alcohol group. But cyclic esters are lactones, which don't have O-H groups unless they're opened, which I'm not sure about.

I'm starting to think that option C is the correct answer. Let me summarize:

- FTIR: O-H (broad) and C=O (sharp). The 1650 could be the conjugated C=C in the ring or another carbonyl group.

- 1H NMR: vinyl H, so double bond.

- Mass spec: fragment at 45. If option C is correct, what would give a fragment of 45? Maybe a (CH3)CO group? But that's 43. Alternatively, maybe a (CH2)CO group, which is 42. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: the fragment is (CH3)COOH minus something. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the 45 fragment is from the cleavage of a C-O bond, leaving a CH2CH2O group. But that's 44 again.

I'm not entirely confident about the mass fragment, but given the other data points, option C seems to fit the IR and NMR data. The O-H and C=O fit with two oxygen atoms, and the vinyl H indicates a double bond. The DoU of 2 in option C can be accounted for by a ring and a double bond or two double bonds.

So, putting it all together, the correct formula is C6H10O2, which is option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves identifying the chemical formula of an unknown compound using FTIR, 1H NMR, and mass spectrometry data. Here's the analysis:

### FTIR Analysis:
- A broad absorption peak at **3000 cm⁻¹** indicates the presence of an O-H group, likely from an alcohol or carboxylic acid.
- Strong absorption peaks at **1700 cm⁻¹** and **1650 cm⁻¹** suggest the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) and possibly a conjugated system or aromatic ring.

### 1H NMR Analysis:
- Peaks corresponding to **vinyl hydrogens** indicate the presence of a double bond (C=C).

### Mass Spectrometry:
- A fragment peak at **m/z = 45** is observed. This could correspond to a fragment such as (CH3)2O or a related structure.

### Evaluation of Options:
#### **Option A: C₆H₁₂O₂**
- **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**

  \text{DoU} = \frac{2C + 2 - H}{2} = \frac{2(6) + 2 - 12}{2} = 1
  \]  
  This indicates one degree of unsaturation, which could be a ring or a double bond. However, the NMR data shows vinyl hydrogens, indicating a double bond. This accounts for the single DoU, but the IR data suggests additional unsaturation (e.g., a carbonyl group), making this option less likely.

#### **Option B: C₆H₁₀O**
- **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**  
  \[
  \text{DoU} = \frac{2C + 2 - H}{2} = \frac{2(6) + 2 - 10}{2} = 2
  \]  
  Two degrees of unsaturation could correspond to a ring and a double bond or two double bonds. However, this formula only has one oxygen atom, which cannot account for both the O-H (broad peak) and the carbonyl group (sharp peak) observed in the IR spectrum. Thus, this option is invalid.

#### **Option C: C₆H₁₀O₂**
- **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**  
  \[
  \text{DoU} = \frac{2C + 2 - H}{2} = \frac{2(6) + 2 - 10}{2} = 2
  \]  
  Two degrees of unsaturation could correspond to a ring and a double bond. The IR spectrum supports this structure, as it includes a broad O-H peak (likely from an alcohol) and a sharp C=O peak (from a carbonyl group). The NMR data, showing vinyl hydrogens, aligns with the presence of a double bond. The mass spectrometry fragment at m/z = 45 could arise from a fragment involving the carbonyl group or related structure. This option fits all the data.

#### **Option D: C₆H₁₂O**
- **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**  
  \[
  \text{DoU} = \frac{2C + 2 - H}{2} = \frac{2(6) + 2 - 12}{2} = 1
  \]  
  This indicates one degree of unsaturation, which could be a ring or a double bond. However, the IR data requires two oxygen-containing functional groups (O-H and C=O), which this formula cannot accommodate. Thus, this option is invalid.

### Conclusion:
The compound must have two oxygen atoms to account for the O-H and C=O groups observed in the IR spectrum. The NMR data supports the presence of a double bond, and the mass spectrometry fragment at m/z = 45 is consistent with a structure containing a carbonyl group. The formula **C₆H₁₀O₂** (Option C) satisfies all the given data.
