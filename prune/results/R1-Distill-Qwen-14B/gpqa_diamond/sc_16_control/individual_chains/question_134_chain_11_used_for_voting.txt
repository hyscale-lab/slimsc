Alright, let me try to figure out this chemistry problem. Hmm, okay, the question is about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when mixing some acids and a base. I remember that neutralization reactions usually involve an acid reacting with a base to produce water and a salt. And the enthalpy change for such reactions can be calculated using the heat of neutralization values.

Wait, what's the enthalpy of neutralization again? Oh right, it's the amount of energy released when one mole of H+ ions from an acid reacts with one mole of OH- ions from a base to form water. For strong acids and bases, this is usually around -57 kJ/mol, but sometimes the problem gives a specific value to use. Wait, in this question, I don't see a given value, so maybe I have to calculate it based on the moles of H+ and OH- ions involved.

So, let's look at the problem. We have three solutions being mixed: HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2. First, I need to determine how much H+ and OH- are present in each solution.

Starting with HCl. HCl is a strong acid, so it dissociates completely. The formula is HCl → H+ + Cl-. So each mole of HCl gives one mole of H+.

We have 500 mL of 0.2 M HCl. To find the moles, I'll calculate Molarity × Volume (in liters). So 0.2 M × 0.5 L = 0.1 moles. So HCl contributes 0.1 moles of H+.

Next, H2SO4. H2SO4 is a strong acid too, but wait, does it dissociate completely? I think the first dissociation is complete: H2SO4 → 2H+ + SO4^2-. Oh wait, wait, no, wait. Wait, no, that's not right. H2SO4 is a strong acid, but it's diprotic. The first H+ comes off completely, but the second one doesn't. Wait, but wait, in dilute solutions, the first dissociation is complete, and the second is not. But I'm not sure if the problem expects me to consider both H+ ions or just the first. Hmm.

Wait, but the problem is about neutralization, so I think we're looking for the equivalents of H+ and OH-. So for H2SO4, each mole gives two moles of H+. Because H2SO4 → 2H+ + SO4^2-.

Wait, but wait, in reality, the first H+ is fully ionized, and the second is only partially, but in a strong acid scenario, maybe we consider all H+ available. So perhaps the problem treats H2SO4 as providing two H+ ions per mole.

So, the solution is 300 mL of 0.3 M H2SO4. Moles = 0.3 M × 0.3 L = 0.09 moles. So each mole gives two H+, so total H+ is 0.09 × 2 = 0.18 moles.

Now, the base is Ba(OH)2. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base; it dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2 OH- ions. So each mole gives two OH- ions.

We have 200 mL of 0.5 M Ba(OH)2. So moles of Ba(OH)2 is 0.5 M × 0.2 L = 0.1 moles. Each gives two OH-, so total OH- is 0.1 × 2 = 0.2 moles.

Wait, but wait a second. Do I need to consider the stoichiometry here? Because H+ and OH- will react in a 1:1 ratio. So the H+ comes from both HCl and H2SO4.

Let me sum up the H+ and OH-:

H+ from HCl: 0.1 mol
H+ from H2SO4: 0.18 mol
Total H+ = 0.28 mol

OH- from Ba(OH)2: 0.2 mol

Now, when they mix, H+ and OH- will react. The reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O, which releases heat.

But the issue is, which one is in excess? Let's see:

Total H+ available: 0.28 mol
Total OH- available: 0.2 mol

So OH- is the limiting reactant. Only 0.2 mol of H+ will react, and there will be 0.08 mol of H+ left (0.28 - 0.2 = 0.08). The OH- is completely consumed.

Wait, but wait. Because H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, but if only one of its H+ is reacting, would that affect how we calculate the neutralization? Hmm, perhaps not. Because the neutralization is just based on H+ and OH- ions reacting, regardless of the source.

So the neutralization reaction will use up all the OH- (0.2 mol), which requires 0.2 mol of H+. The H+ comes from both HCl and H2SO4.

But wait, H2SO4 contributes 2 H+ per mole, but for neutralization, each H+ can come from any source. So the total H+ available is 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28. But wait, because the OH- is 0.2, only 0.2 H+ will be used. Which means some H+ will remain un-neutralized. But for the purpose of enthalpy calculation, we only care about the moles that actually react.

So the moles of H+ reacting is 0.2 mol. Each mole of H+ reacting releases 57 kJ (or is it kcal?), wait, the standard enthalpy of neutralization is about -57 kJ per mole of H+.

Wait, the standard value is -57.3 kJ per mole for strong acids and strong bases. So each mole of H+ that reacts releases 57.3 kJ.

But wait, the options have kcal as an unit in some, and kJ in others. Oh, that's important. I need to make sure which units to use.

Wait, 1 kcal is approximately 4.184 kJ. So if the problem expects the answer in kcal, I need to calculate accordingly.

So moles of H+ reacting is 0.2 mol. So enthalpy change would be 0.2 * (-57.3 kJ/mol) = -11.46 kJ. Then, to convert to kcal: -11.46 kJ / 4.184 kJ/kcal ≈ -2.736 kcal.

Looking at the options:

Option A is -2.72 kcal, which is close to this value. Option B is -11.42 kJ (which is approximately the same as -11.46 kJ, but in kJ), but the options have different units. Hmm. So what's the expected unit here?

Wait, the options have some in kcal and some in kJ. Let me re-examine the question. It says, "Calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when... are mixed." So enthalpy is usually in kJ or kcal, but the question doesn't specify units, but the options have both.

Wait, the options are:

A) -2.72 kcal

B) -11.42 kcal

C) -3.80 kcal

D) -16.0 kJ

Wait, option B is -11.42 kcal — which is way off in terms of unit conversion. Because 11.42 kJ is about 2.73 kcal.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in unit conversion. Let me recheck.

Wait, wait, let me think again. The enthalpy of neutralization is typically given as -57.3 kJ per mole of H+ (or OH-), which is about -13.66 kcal/mol (since 57.3/4.184 ≈ 13.66). So if 0.2 moles of H+ react, the enthalpy change would be 0.2 * (-57.3 kJ) = -11.46 kJ, which is approximately -2.736 kcal. So in kcal, it's about -2.74 kcal.

Looking at the options, option A is -2.72 kcal, which is very close. Option D is -16.0 kJ, which is larger than our calculated -11.46, so that's not it.

Wait, but why is the number of moles 0.2? Because the OH- is 0.2 moles, so the H+ that reacts is 0.2 moles. So the enthalpy is 0.2 * (-57.3) = -11.46 kJ, which is -11.46 kJ, but that's not an option. The options have B as -11.42 kcal, but wait, that would be way too high because 11.42 kcal is about 48.6 kJ, which is much larger than our calculation.

Wait, so perhaps I have the unit wrong. Let me think: if the question expects the answer in kJ, then the enthalpy would be -11.46 kJ, which is approximately -11.5 kJ. But the options don't have that, except maybe option B is in kJ? Wait, no. Option B is -11.42 kcal. So that can't be it.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering which H+ ions are available. Let me double-check the H+ contributions.

HCl: 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 mol HCl → 0.1 mol H+.

H2SO4: 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 mol H2SO4. Since each gives 2 H+, so 0.18 mol H+.

Total H+ = 0.28 mol.

OH- from Ba(OH)2: 0.5 M * 0.2 L = 0.1 mol Ba(OH)2. Each gives 2 OH-, so 0.2 mol OH-.

So H+ and OH- react in 1:1. So 0.2 mol OH- will react with 0.2 mol H+.

So the moles reacting is 0.2, thus the enthalpy change is 0.2 * 57.3 kJ = 11.46 kJ released, so enthalpy is -11.46 kJ.

But looking at the options, the only one close in kJ is D) -16.0 kJ, but that's not close. Wait, maybe my initial assumption about the enthalpy per mole is wrong. Or perhaps the question uses a different value, like 4.18 kJ/mol or something? No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, wait, another thought: perhaps the Ba(OH)2 is a diprotic base, so each mole gives two OH-, but in reality, is Ba(OH)2 fully dissociated? Yes, because it's a strong base.

Alternatively, maybe I should consider the neutralization in terms of the equivalents of H+ and OH-.

Wait, maybe I should calculate the total equivalents of H+ and OH-.

Equivalents = Molarity × Volume × n, where n is the number of H+ or OH- per molecule.

For HCl: 0.2 M × 0.5 L × 1 = 0.1 eq.

H2SO4: 0.3 M × 0.3 L × 2 = 0.18 eq.

Ba(OH)2: 0.5 M × 0.2 L × 2 = 0.2 eq.

So total H+ equivalents: 0.28 eq.

Total OH- equivalents: 0.2 eq.

So the neutralization will involve 0.2 eq of OH- reacting with 0.2 eq of H+. So the total H+ used is 0.2, leaving 0.08 eq of H+ un-neutralized.

But the enthalpy change is based on the moles that reacted. So 0.2 eq × 57.3 kJ/(eq) = -11.46 kJ. So in kcal, that's about -2.736 kcal.

Looking at the options, option A is -2.72 kcal, which is very close. So that's likely the correct answer.

Alternatively, perhaps the question uses a different value for the enthalpy of neutralization, like 13.66 kcal/mol. Let me compute that. 0.2 mol × (-57.3 kJ/mol) is -11.46 kJ, which is -11.46 / 4.184 ≈ -2.736 kcal. So the answer is approximately -2.74 kcal, which rounds to -2.72 kcal as in option A.

So the correct answer should be option A.

To calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when 500 mL 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL 0.3 M H₂SO₄, and 200 mL 0.5 M Ba(OH)₂ are mixed, we first determine the moles of H⁺ and OH⁻ ions contributed by each solution:

1. **HCl (H⁺ source):**  
   HCl dissociates completely as HCl → H⁺ + Cl⁻.  
   Moles of HCl = \( 0.2 \, \text{M} \times 0.5 \, \text{L} = 0.1 \, \text{mol} \).  
   Moles of H⁺ = \( 0.1 \, \text{mol} \).

2. **H₂SO₄ (H⁺ source):**  
   H₂SO₄ dissociates as H₂SO₄ → 2H⁺ + SO₄²⁻.  
   Moles of H₂SO₄ = \( 0.3 \, \text{M} \times 0.3 \, \text{L} = 0.09 \, \text{mol} \).  
   Moles of H⁺ = \( 0.09 \, \text{mol} \times 2 = 0.18 \, \text{mol} \).

3. **Ba(OH)₂ (OH⁻ source):**  
   Ba(OH)₂ dissociates completely as Ba(OH)₂ → Ba²⁺ + 2OH⁻.  
   Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = \( 0.5 \, \text{M} \times 0.2 \, \text{L} = 0.1 \, \text{mol} \).  
   Moles of OH⁻ = \( 0.1 \, \text{mol} \times 2 = 0.2 \, \text{mol} \).

Next, the neutralization reaction occurs as \( \text{H⁺} + \text{OH⁻} \to \text{H₂O} \). The limiting reactant is OH⁻, which has \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \). Therefore, \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \) of H⁺ reacts with \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \) of OH⁻ to form water.

The enthalpy of neutralization for strong acids and bases is approximately \( -57.3 \, \text{kJ/mol} \) or \( -13.66 \, \text{kcal/mol} \). Using \( -57.3 \, \text{kJ/mol} \), the total enthalpy change is:  
\[
\Delta H = 0.2 \, \text{mol} \times (-57.3 \, \text{kJ/mol}) = -11.46 \, \text{kJ}.
\]  
To convert to kcal:  
\[
\Delta H = \frac{-11.46 \, \text{kJ}}{4.184 \, \text{kJ/kcal}} \approx -2.74 \, \text{kcal}.
\]  

Comparing this result with the options:  
- **Option A (-2.72 kcal):** Closest to the calculated value of \( -2.74 \, \text{kcal} \).  
- **Option B (-11.42 kcal):** Incorrect, as it misrepresents the unit conversion.  
- **Option C (-3.80 kcal):** Too far from the calculated value.  
- **Option D (-16.0 kJ):** Incorrect, as it does not match the calculated \( -11.46 \, \text{kJ} \).

Thus, the correct answer is **A (-2.72 kcal)**.

Answer: A
