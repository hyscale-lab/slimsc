Okay, so I've got this question about neutrinos from the Sun and the pp-III branch stopping. Hmm, I need to find the ratio of the flux between two energy bands. Let's see.

Wait, first, I should remember what the pp-III branch is. Oh right, the proton-proton chain is the main source of energy in the Sun's core. The pp-I branch produces deuterium, then there's pp-II and pp-III. Oh, wait, pp-III is the part where the 3He produced in pp-I combines with protons to make 4He. So when the question says the pp-III branch stopped, that means those reactions aren't happening anymore.

So the Sun's neutrino production is mainly from the pp-chain and the CNO cycle. But the pp-chain produces more neutrinos. Oh wait, but the pp-III branch is part of the pp-chain. So if that stops, the production of neutrinos from that part would stop.

But wait, the question is about the flux of neutrinos reaching Earth. So the Sun's neutrino production is from various processes. The dominant ones are the pp-chain's main branch, and the CNO cycle. But the pp-III branch is a part of the pp-chain. So stopping it would reduce the neutrino flux from that part.

Wait, but the question says the pp-III branch stopped about 8.5 minutes ago. Since neutrinos travel at almost the speed of light, and the Sun's radius is about 700,000 km. So the time it takes for neutrinos to reach Earth is about (700,000 km / (3e5 km/s)) = roughly 2.3 seconds. Wait, no, wait—the Sun's radius is about 7e5 km. Let me compute it: 7e8 meters. Speed of light is 3e8 m/s. Time is 7e8 / 3e8 = approx 2.33 seconds. So if the pp-III stopped 8.5 minutes ago, the neutrinos from that process would have stopped arriving 8.5 minutes minus a few seconds ago. So effectively, the absence of pp-III neutrinos is already felt on Earth.

But the neutrinos are produced in different energy ranges. The question is about two bands: 700-800 keV and 800-900 keV. So what's the source of these neutrinos?

Wait, neutrinos from the Sun's main pp-chain are the pep and the main pp reactions. The CNO cycle also produces neutrinos. Let me think about the energies.

The main pp reaction produces a 7 Be which then decays into 7 Li + electron neutrino. The energy of that neutrino is about 0.385 MeV. Then there's the pep reaction, which produces a lower-energy neutrino, around 1.4 MeV? Wait, no, wait. Wait, I'm getting a bit mixed up. Wait, the main pp reactions produce neutrinos in the 0.385 MeV range. The CNO cycle produces higher-energy neutrinos, but I'm not exactly sure how high.

Wait, but the question is about the pp-III branch. What happens when that stops? The pp-III branch is where the 3He from pp-I combines with protons to form 4He. So the main pp-chain includes this part. So the neutrino production from 3He burning would stop.

Wait, but what kind of neutrinos are produced in the pp-III branch? I think that in the main pp-chain, the dominant neutrino species come from the 7 Be decay (producing 7 Li + ν_e, about 0.385 MeV), and perhaps from the 8 B decay in the CNO cycle, which produces higher-energy neutrinos. But I'm a bit confused.

Alternatively, wait, the CNO cycle produces more high-energy neutrinos. So if the pp-III branch stops, it affects the production of which neutrinos?

So, in the Sun, the main sources of neutrinos are:

1. The proton-proton chain (pp-chain), which includes the pp-I, pp-II, and pp-III branches.
2. The CNO cycle.

The CNO cycle is a minor contributor compared to the pp-chain, but produces higher-energy neutrinos.

In the pp-chain, the main neutrino production comes from the decay of 7Be into 7Li, which emits a neutrino around 0.385 MeV. The pp-III branch involves 3He + p → 4He + e+ + ν_e. Wait, does that produce a neutrino? Or is it a positron and a neutrino? So each 3He + p reaction produces a neutrino with higher energy?

Wait, I might need to think about the specific neutrino energies. So the main neutrinos from the Sun are from:

- The 7Be decay (pp-chain): ~0.385 MeV, called the main pp neutrino.
- The CNO cycle: produces 8B neutrinos which decay into β+ and ν_e, with energies around 15-18 MeV, but that's a higher energy. Wait, no, wait: the CNO neutrinos are from 13N decay (which is about 2 MeV) and 8B decay (which is about 15 MeV). So the 13N neutrinos are around 2 MeV, and the 8B are higher.

But the question is about the 700-800 keV and 800-900 keV bands. Those are around 0.7 to 0.9 MeV and 0.8 to 0.9 MeV. Hmm, so neutrinos in these ranges. Let's see.

The main pp neutrino is around 0.385 MeV. So that's lower than 0.7 MeV. So perhaps the higher energy neutrinos are from elsewhere. Wait, are there other sources in the Sun that produce neutrinos in the 0.7-0.9 MeV range?

Ah, another source is the 7Be(p,ν) reaction. Wait, I might be mixing up the different processes. Alternatively, perhaps the 3He burning in the pp-III branch produces higher-energy neutrinos.

Wait, the reaction in pp-III is 3He + p → 4He + e+ + ν_e. So each of these reactions emits a neutrino. What's the energy of that neutrino? Well, it's roughly on the order of the kinetic energy of the products. The mass of 4He is about 4 atomic mass units (u), 3He is about 3, and a proton is 1. So the mass difference is about (3 + 1) → 4, so the mass is about 4 u on both sides. Wait, no, 3He is 3 u, plus a proton (1 u) gives 4 u, same as 4He (4 u). So the mass difference is zero, but because of the kinetic energy, the neutrino carries away energy. But the exact energy depends on the reaction.

Wait, in the reaction 3He + p → 4He + e+ + ν_e, the neutrino energy is typically higher than the main pp neutrino. So the main pp neutrino is about 0.385 MeV, but the neutrinos from the pp-III branch could be higher. But I'm not exactly sure the exact energy.

Alternatively, maybe the question is about the muon and tau neutrinos, but the note says that flavor changes don't play a role here. So we can ignore that.

So, if the pp-III branch stops, the production of neutrinos from that branch stops. So the flux of neutrinos from that process would drop to zero.

So the question is, which neutrino bands are affected by the pp-III branch? The bands are 700-800 keV (0.7-0.8 MeV) and 800-900 keV (0.8-0.9 MeV). So if the pp-III neutrinos are in this range, then stopping it would reduce the flux in those bands.

Wait, but the main pp neutrino is at 0.385 MeV, which is in a lower band. So the neutrinos from the pp-III branch must be in higher energies. Let's see.

I think the neutrinos from the 3He burning (pp-III) have higher energies than the main pp neutrinos. So if the pp-III stops, the neutrinos in the 0.7-0.9 MeV range would be reduced.

So the flux in band 1 (0.7-0.8 MeV) and band 2 (0.8-0.9 MeV) would be affected if the pp-III neutrinos are in this range.

Wait, but perhaps the main neutrinos in the Sun are the 0.385 MeV ones, and the pp-III contributes higher energy neutrinos. So when pp-III stops, the higher energy bands (like 0.7-0.9 MeV) would have less flux.

But the question is about the ratio of flux between band 1 and band 2. Let's think about the neutrino production rates.

If the pp-III branch is stopped, the neutrinos from that source (which may be in higher energies) would stop. So the higher energy bands would be more affected, perhaps.

Wait, but the total neutrino flux from the Sun is dominated by the main pp-chain, which produces the 0.385 MeV neutrinos. The CNO neutrinos are about 1-2% of the total, but they're higher energy. So if the pp-III neutrinos are a part of the main pp-chain's contribution, stopping it would reduce the flux in the higher energy bands.

Wait, but the question is about the ratio of flux between two bands: band 1 (0.7-0.8 MeV) and band 2 (0.8-0.9). So if the pp-III neutrinos are in these bands, stopping it would reduce the flux in these bands. But if the neutrinos in these bands are also from other processes, like the CNO cycle, then the ratio would change.

Wait, but the CNO neutrinos are from 13N and 8B. 13N decays to 13C with a neutrino energy around 2 MeV. 8B decays to 8Be with a neutrino energy around 15.5 MeV. So these are much higher than 0.7-0.9 MeV. So the CNO neutrinos are in higher energy ranges than the ones we're considering here.

So the neutrinos in the 0.7-0.9 MeV range must come from the pp-chain. Specifically, perhaps the pep reaction. Wait, the pep reaction is another part of the pp-chain, which produces a higher-energy neutrino than the main pp. Let me check: the pep reaction is 2H + e+ → 3He + ν_e. The neutrino energy from this is about 1.4 MeV, which is higher than the main pp. But 1.4 MeV is higher than 0.9 MeV. So, that's not in the 0.7-0.9 range.

Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the neutrinos from the 3He burning (pp-III) have lower energies than the pep neutrinos. Or maybe the 7Be captures a proton to form 8B, which then emits a neutrino. Wait, but that's part of the CNO cycle, which is a different process.

Alternatively, perhaps the 3He + p → 4He + e+ + ν_e reaction produces a neutrino with energy around 0.5-0.8 MeV. If that's the case, then the flux in the 0.7-0.9 MeV band would be affected.

So, in the Sun, the total neutrino flux is dominated by the main pp-chain (0.385 MeV), then the pep reaction (1.4 MeV), and the CNO neutrinos (about 2 and 15 MeV). So the 0.7-0.9 MeV range is actually a kind of 'gap' in the neutrino spectrum. So maybe the neutrinos in that range are from the pp-III branch.

So if the pp-III branch is stopped, the neutrinos in that higher energy range would be significantly reduced. So the flux in band 1 and band 2 would drop compared to before.

But the question is about the ratio of the flux. Before the pp-III stopped, all neutrinos were being produced as usual. So if the pp-III was the main source of neutrinos in the 0.7-0.9 MeV range, then stopping it would cause a much larger drop in bands 1 and 2 than in the lower bands.

Wait, but the main pp neutrinos are at 0.385 MeV. So band 1 and 2 are higher than that. So if the source for those higher bands is the pp-III and perhaps other minor sources, then when pp-III stops, those bands would have much less flux.

But what about the CNO neutrinos? Earlier I thought the CNO neutrinos are at 2 MeV and 15 MeV, which is higher than 0.9 MeV. So the 0.7-0.9 MeV range would not be affected by stopping the CNO cycle, which is still active.

So, the flux in the 0.7-0.9 MeV bands is only from the pp-III branch. So when the pp-III stops, the flux in those bands becomes zero, or nearly zero. But wait, are there any other sources of neutrinos in that range? Like maybe the decay of other isotopes?

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the 3He + p reaction produces a neutrino with energy around 0.5 MeV. So in the range of 0.5-1 MeV. So the 0.7-0.9 MeV would be part of that. So if pp-III stops, the higher energy bands would lose a significant part of their flux.

But without the pp-III, the flux in these bands would drop to a much lower level. So the ratio would depend on how much of each band's flux comes from pp-III.

If both bands (700-800 and 800-900 keV) are mainly from pp-III, then their fluxes would drop by the same proportion. But wait, maybe the higher energy part of the band (like 800-900 keV) has a bit from the CNO, but that's not the case. Because CNO's 13N neutrinos are around 2 MeV, as I thought earlier.

So, the flux in both bands is dominated by the pp-III. Therefore, when the pp-III stops, the flux in both band 1 and band 2 drops to zero, or a negligible amount.

Wait, but before the pp-III stopped, what was the flux in these bands? If the pp-III was the main contributor, then the flux in band 1 and 2 would be much higher than in the main pp bands. So, stopping pp-III would cause the flux in these bands to drop, but how much?

Wait, the overall neutrino flux from the Sun is ~6e10 per cm² per second. The main pp contributes about 86% of that, the pep about 14%, and the CNO about 2%. If the pp-III is part of the main pp, which contributes 86%, then perhaps the pp-III neutrinos are a part of that 86% but only in the higher energy range.

So, if the pp-III neutrinos are in bands 1 and 2, then their flux would be a fraction of the main pp flux.

Suppose that the main pp neutrinos are at 0.385 MeV, and the pp-III produce neutrinos at 0.7-0.9 MeV.

So, the total flux from main pp is 86% of the total, and the pp-III is perhaps a small fraction of that. Let's say the main pp neutrinos are at 0.385 MeV, and perhaps the pp-III neutrinos are about 10% of the main pp flux. So, the main pp is 86% of the total, pp-III is 8.6% of the total.

So, in the energy bands of 0.7-0.8 MeV and 0.8-0.9 MeV, the neutrinos from pp-III are the only contributors. So the flux in these bands is, say, 8% of the total flux. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy distribution of the main pp neutrinos is a narrow line at 0.385 MeV, and the pp-III neutrinos have a broader distribution, maybe higher energy.

Wait, but we're considering the flux in two specific bands. If the pp-III neutrinos are in the 0.7-0.9 MeV range, and their production stops, then the flux in these bands would drop. The other bands (like lower energies) wouldn't be affected, except for the main pp neutrinos.

So before the pp-III stopped, the flux in band 1 and 2 was coming from pp-III. The flux in lower bands is from main pp and perhaps other sources, but not affected here.

So, the question is about the ratio of flux band1 / flux band2 after the pp-III stopped. Well, if both bands are now only getting neutrinos from other sources (like CNO or main pp), but CNO doesn't contribute in these bands, then the flux in band1 and 2 would drop, but the ratio would depend on the shape of the pp-III neutrino spectrum.

Wait, but if the pp-III neutrinos are the only source for these bands, then their flux would drop to zero. So, the flux in band1 and band2 would both be zero, making the ratio undefined or zero. But that's not an option here. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. The question says that the pp-III branch stopped, but all other reactions remain as they were. So the main pp and other branches continue. So the main pp neutrinos are still being produced. So, in that case, maybe the neutrinos from the main pp are present, but the higher energy neutrinos from pp-III are gone.

Wait, but the main pp neutrinos are at 0.385 MeV, which is not in the 0.7-0.9 MeV range. So if the pp-III neutrinos are in the 0.7-0.9 MeV range, and they stop, then the flux in those bands would drop to whatever other sources contribute, which is perhaps negligible.

So without the pp-III, the flux in band1 and band2 would be very low, but the ratio depends on how the pp-III neutrinos were distributed in these bands.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III neutrinos have a certain energy distribution. For example, perhaps the neutrinos from pp-III have a spectrum that's more towards higher energies, so band2 (800-900 keV) has more pp-III neutrinos than band1 (700-800).

In that case, when pp-III stops, the flux in band2 would drop more than band1, so the ratio band1 / band2 would increase.

Wait, but before the pp-III stopped, the flux in both bands was from pp-III. After stopping, the flux in both bands is now zero (or near zero), but that can't be the case because the question says other reactions are ongoing.

Wait, but other reactions are ongoing, including the main pp and CNO. But the main pp produces neutrinos at 0.385 MeV, which doesn't affect the 0.7-0.9 MeV bands. The CNO neutrino production is at higher energies (like 2 MeV and 15 MeV), so they don't affect bands 1 and 2.

So, without pp-III, the only sources for bands 1 and 2 are gone. So the flux in these bands would drop to a very low level, but the ratio would depend on any residual sources. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering that other parts of the pp-chain contribute to these bands, but I don't think so.

Wait, maybe the neutrinos from the main pp-chain have a distribution that includes some in the 0.7-0.9 MeV range. Or perhaps I'm confusing it with other processes.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the ratio of the current flux to the previous flux, but I'm not sure.

Wait, no, the question is about the current flux after the pp-III stopped. So, the neutrinos in bands 1 and 2 are now only from sources that haven't stopped. But since the main pp neutrinos are at 0.385 MeV, they don't contribute to these bands. The CNO neutrinos are higher energy, so they don't contribute either. So the flux in bands 1 and 2 is now very low.

But what about other processes? Are there any other sources of neutrinos in the Sun in the 0.7-0.9 MeV range?

Wait, I think there are also neutrinos from the decay of 13W and other isotopes, but I'm not sure about their energies. Alternatively, maybe the 8B neutrinos have a range of energies, but I thought they are around 15 MeV.

Alternatively, perhaps the 3He + p reaction produces neutrinos with a range of energies, some falling into bands 1 and 2. So when that stops, the flux in those bands drops to almost zero.

In that case, the ratio of flux between band1 and band2 would be 1, assuming the pp-III neutrinos were uniformly distributed between 0.7 and 0.9 MeV. Or perhaps the distribution gives a higher flux in band2.

Wait, but without knowing the exact distribution, perhaps the flux in both bands is now zero, making the ratio undefined. But the options don't include an undefined case. So perhaps the question is implying that the neutrinos in these bands are entirely from the pp-III branch, and other sources contribute negligibly.

So, if the pp-III neutrinos were the only source, then the flux in these bands becomes zero, making the ratio zero. But zero isn't an option. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the question is asking for the ratio before and after the pp-III stopped. But the question says 'the flux between two bands', implying the current state.

Wait, perhaps the pp-III neutrinos are the main source of the higher energy neutrinos, but some of the main pp neutrinos may have a spread that includes these bands. But I don't think so; the main pp neutrinos are a narrow line at 0.385 MeV.

Alternatively, perhaps the main pp neutrinos have a distribution that includes a small fraction in the 0.7-0.9 MeV range, but I think that's unlikely. So, without pp-III, the flux in bands 1 and 2 drops, but perhaps the main pp neutrinos are still present.

Wait, but the main pp neutrinos are at 0.385 MeV, so they don't contribute to bands 1 and 2. So the flux in bands 1 and 2 is now from whatever sources are left. If pp-III was the only source, then the flux in both bands is zero.

So the ratio would be 0/(0), which is undefined. But since the options don't have that, perhaps the question is implying that the neutrinos in these bands are from the pp-III and other sources, but those other sources are negligible or non-existent.

Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the energy ranges. Let me think about the energies of the neutrinos.

The main pp neutrino is ~0.385 MeV, which is 385 keV. So that's below 700 keV. The CNO neutrinos are at higher energies. So, any neutrinos in the 700-800 keV and 800-900 keV bands must come from other sources. The only option is the pp-III branch.

So, the pp-III neutrinos must be in this range. So, when pp-III stops, the flux in bands 1 and 2 would drop to near zero. But in that case, the ratio of their fluxes would be undefined or zero, but the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps the pp-III neutrinos are a minor component of the total flux. So when they stop, the main pp and CNO neutrinos are still present, but these don't contribute to bands 1 and 2. So the flux in bands 1 and 2 is from pp-III, which is now gone, so their flux drops to zero. So the ratio of band1 to band2 would be zero, but that's not an option either.

Hmm, perhaps the question is more about the relative contributions of band1 and band2 from the pp-III neutrinos. For example, if the pp-III neutrinos have a higher flux in band2 than in band1, then the ratio band1/band2 would be less than 1.

If the pp-III neutrinos have a distribution that peaks at higher energies, then band2 (800-900 keV) would have a higher flux than band1 (700-800 keV). So, the ratio flux1/flux2 would be less than 1.

Alternatively, if the distribution is flat, the ratio would be 1.

But without knowing the exact distribution, it's hard. But in reality, the neutrinos from the 3He burning (pp-III) would have a certain energy spectrum. I think the 3He + p reaction produces neutrinos with energies up to about 0.8 MeV. So, perhaps the majority of the pp-III neutrinos are in the lower part of band1 (700-800 keV) and part of band2 (800-900 keV).

If the distribution of pp-III neutrinos is such that more of them fall into band2 than band1, then after stopping, the flux in band2 would be lower than band1. Wait, no, because if both are only from pp-III, and the distribution is such that band2 has more, then when pp-III stops, both drop, but band2's flux would have been higher. So the ratio band1/band2 would be lower than 1, perhaps around 0.1.

Wait, but if the pp-III neutrinos are distributed so that more are in band2, then the flux in band2 is higher than band1. So after stopping, both are zero, but if the question is about the original ratio, then band1/band2 would be less than 1. But the question is after the pp-III stopped, so the flux in both is zero. Hmm, but the options don't have zero, so perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The question is about the ratio after the pp-III stopped. If the pp-III neutrinos were the only source for bands1 and 2, then the flux in both is now zero, so the ratio is undefined. But since that's not an option, perhaps the question is assuming that other sources contribute, but I can't think of any.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the relative production rates of the pp-III neutrinos in these bands. If the production rate in band2 is higher than band1, then the ratio would be less than 1.

Wait, perhaps the number of neutrinos produced in the Sun in these bands depends on the cross-sections and reaction rates. The reaction 3He + p → 4He + e+ + ν_e produces a neutrino, and the number depends on the energy.

The number of neutrinos produced at a certain energy depends on the reaction rate, which depends on the neutrino energy. Higher neutrino energy would require higher reaction rates, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, the flux in higher energy bands (like 800-900 keV) would have a lower number of neutrinos, perhaps, because the cross-section might drop off at higher energies. So maybe band1 (700-800) has a higher flux than band2 (800-900), making the ratio (flux1/flux2) greater than 1.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, if the production rate is higher for lower energies in the pp-III branch, then band1 would have more neutrinos than band2. So the ratio would be greater than 1. The options include 10 (A), 1 (C), 0.1 (D), and 0.01 (B).

If the ratio is 10, that would mean band1 has 10 times the flux of band2. If the production is such that more neutrinos are in band1 than band2, then this would happen.

But I'm not confident about the exact distribution. Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III neutrinos have a distribution where the flux decreases with higher energy. So, band1 has more neutrinos than band2. So the ratio band1/band2 would be greater than 1, perhaps around 10.

But why would the flux in band1 be 10 times that of band2? That depends on how the neutrino energies are distributed.

Another angle: the number of neutrinos emitted per reaction is fixed, but their energies vary. The reaction 3He + p → 4He + e+ + ν_e has a range of possible neutrino energies, depending on the kinetic energy of the products.

The energy of the neutrino is determined by the mass difference between the initial and final states and the available energy. Since the masses are similar, the neutrino energy would vary but perhaps peak around a certain value.

But without exact data, it's hard to say. So I'll need to make an educated guess.

If the pp-III neutrinos are only in the 0.7-0.9 MeV range, and their flux is higher in band1 (700-800) than band2 (800-900), then the ratio would be greater than 1. So the options are A (10), C (1), D (0.1), B (0.01).

Alternatively, perhaps the flux in band1 is about the same as band2, giving a ratio of 1.

But I'm not sure. Another approach: think about the solar model. The main neutrinos are the 0.385 MeV ones. The CNO are higher. The pep is about 1.4 MeV. The pp-III neutrinos are in between, perhaps around 0.5 MeV to 0.8 MeV. So, in the 700-800 keV and 800-900 keV bands, the pp-III neutrinos are the main contributors.

If the pp-III neutrinos have a spectrum that's higher in the lower part of their energy range, meaning more in band1 than band2, then the ratio would be higher than 1.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of neutrinos in band1 is about the same as band2. That would make the ratio 1.

But assuming that the flux in band1 is about the same as band2, the ratio would be 1.

But I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the CNO cycle contributes a bit, but as I said earlier, their neutrinos are much higher. So, without the pp-III, the flux in these bands is zero, but that's not an option.

Another possibility is that the question is about the ratio before and after the pp-III stopped. But the question is about the current ratio, so I think the flux in both bands is now zero or very low. But since the options don't have zero, perhaps the ratio is 0.1 or 10.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III neutrinos are spread in such a way that band1 has more than band2. So the ratio band1/band2 is higher than 1.

But without exact data, it's hard. Considering the options, perhaps the correct answer is 1. So option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves determining the ratio of the flux of solar neutrinos in two energy bands (700-800 keV and 800-900 keV) after the pp-III branch of the proton-proton chain in the Sun's core hypothetically stops. The pp-III branch is responsible for producing neutrinos through the reaction \( ^3\text{He} + p \to ^4\text{He} + e^+ + \nu_e \), and these neutrinos are thought to have energies in the range of 0.7–0.9 MeV. The main pp-chain produces neutrinos at 0.385 MeV, while the CNO cycle produces higher-energy neutrinos (around 2 MeV and 15 MeV), which do not contribute to the bands in question.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Neutrino Sources**:
   - The main pp-chain produces neutrinos at 0.385 MeV, which do not contribute to the 700-800 keV and 800-900 keV bands.
   - The CNO cycle produces neutrinos at much higher energies (2 MeV and 15 MeV), so it also does not contribute to these bands.
   - The pp-III branch is the primary source of neutrinos in the 0.7–0.9 MeV range, which corresponds to the two bands in question.

2. **Impact of Stopping the pp-III Branch**:
   - If the pp-III branch stops, the flux of neutrinos in the 700-800 keV and 800-900 keV bands would drop significantly, as these neutrinos are no longer being produced.
   - The ratio of the flux between these two bands depends on the distribution of pp-III neutrinos across these energy ranges.

3. **Energy Distribution of pp-III Neutrinos**:
   - The pp-III neutrinos are produced with a range of energies. If the distribution of these neutrinos is such that there are more neutrinos in the 700-800 keV band (band 1) than in the 800-900 keV band (band 2), the ratio \( \text{flux(band 1)} / \text{flux(band 2)} \) would be greater than 1.
   - Conversely, if the distribution is such that there are more neutrinos in band 2, the ratio would be less than 1.

4. **Options and Reasoning**:
   - **Option A (10)**: This would imply that band 1 has 10 times the flux of band 2. This is plausible if the pp-III neutrinos are distributed such that there is a significantly higher flux in band 1.
   - **Option B (0.01)**: This would imply that band 1 has only 1% of the flux of band 2. This is unlikely unless the pp-III neutrinos are strongly skewed toward higher energies in band 2.
   - **Option C (1)**: This would imply that the flux in band 1 and band 2 is the same. This is plausible if the pp-III neutrinos are uniformly distributed between 0.7 and 0.9 MeV.
   - **Option D (0.1)**: This would imply that band 1 has 10% of the flux of band 2. This is less likely unless the pp-III neutrinos are skewed toward higher energies in band 2.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Given the lack of explicit information about the exact energy distribution of pp-III neutrinos, the most reasonable assumption is that their flux is relatively uniform across the 0.7–0.9 MeV range. This would result in a ratio close to 1.
