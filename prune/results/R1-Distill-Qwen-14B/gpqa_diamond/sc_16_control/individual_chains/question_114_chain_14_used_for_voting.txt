Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct reagents for the given reactions. Let me start by breaking it down step by step.

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to form 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Hmm, I remember that when ketones react with cyanide, it's a nucleophilic addition. Typically, this is done under acidic conditions because the ketone's carbonyl group is activated by the acid. So the acid would protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making it more electrophilic. NaCN is the cyanide source, so I guess the nitrile group adds to the carbonyl carbon.

Wait, but the product is a hydroxy nitrile. Oh right, there's a process called the Stephen reduction, but that's for esters. Maybe this is the formation of a cyanohydrin. Yeah, I think that's right. The cyanohydrin formation involves adding CN- to the carbonyl, and the acid is a catalyst. So the reagent A is probably H3O+ (acid). So in the first reaction, A is H3O+.

Now the second reaction: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile with reagent B and H2O gives 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. So the nitrile group (-CN) is being converted into a carboxylic acid (-COOH). I need to think about the reagents that convert nitriles to carboxylic acids.

I remember that nitriles can be hydrolyzed under acidic or basic conditions. The common methods are acidic hydrolysis and hydrolysis with KMnO4 or other strong oxidizing agents. Wait, but in this case, the starting material also has a hydroxyl group. So the nitrile is adjacent to an OH group. How does that affect the reaction conditions?

In acidic conditions, like HCl or H2SO4, the nitrile would hydrolyze to a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, using a strong oxidizing agent like KMnO4 under acidic conditions would also oxidize the nitrile to a carboxylic acid. But wait, the product is a hydroxy acid, so maybe we don't have any loss of the hydroxyl group. So the reaction is probably a hydrolysis of the nitrile to a carboxylic acid without affecting the existing hydroxyl group.

Another thought: hydroboration or other reactions? No, that's for alkenes. So back to the nitrile hydrolysis. When nitriles are treated with H2O in the presence of an acid catalyst, like HCl, they hydrolyze to carboxylic acids. So reagent B here is probably an acid, like HCl. Alternatively, sometimes you use a base, but that would give an ammonium salt, which then would need acid workup. But in this case, the product is the acid, so probably acidic conditions.

Wait, looking at the options, the options for B are HCl and CH3COOH. So if B is HCl, that would fit the acidic hydrolysis scenario.

Putting it all together: for reaction 1, reagent A is H3O+ (acid), so in the options, options A and B have A as H3O+. For reaction 2, reagent B is HCl, which is option A.

But wait, I should double-check. The second reaction's reagent is B. So the reagents are A and B for each respective step. So for the first reaction, A is H3O+; for the second, B is HCl. Looking at the options:

Option A: A=H3O+, B=HCl → fits.

Option B: B=CH3COOH, which is a weaker acid. Could that work? Maybe, but HCl is a stronger acid and would be more effective in protonating and driving the reaction.

Wait, but in the first reaction, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So butan-2-one (which is (CH3)2CO) adds CN- in the presence of acid, making (CH3)2C(OH)CN. Right. So that's correct with H3O+.

In the second reaction, the nitrile is converted to a carboxylic acid. So the nitrile group becomes -COOH. So using HCl as an acid catalyst in the hydrolysis makes sense.

So the reagents are A = H3O+ and B = HCl. Looking at the options, option A says A=H3O+, B=HCl. So option A is correct.

Wait, but another possibility: sometimes, for nitrile hydrolysis, especially when you have other functional groups, you might use a different acid. But in this case, HCl should be fine. So yes, the correct answer is option A.

The first reaction involves the conversion of butan-2-one to 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile in the presence of NaCN and reagent A. This is a nucleophilic addition reaction where the cyanide ion adds to the carbonyl carbon, forming a cyanohydrin. Acidic conditions are typically required to protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making it more electrophilic. Therefore, reagent A is likely H₃O⁺ (acid).

The second reaction involves the conversion of 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile to 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. This is a nitrile hydrolysis reaction, where the nitrile group (-CN) is converted into a carboxylic acid (-COOH). Acidic conditions, such as those provided by HCl, are suitable for this reaction, as they facilitate the hydrolysis of the nitrile group while leaving the hydroxyl group intact.

Analyzing the options:
- **Option A**: A = H₃O⁺, B = HCl. This matches the requirements for both reactions.
- **Option B**: A = H₃O⁺, B = CH₃COOH. While A is correct, B (CH₃COOH) is a weaker acid and less effective for the hydrolysis of the nitrile group.
- **Option C**: A = NaHSO₃, B = HCl. NaHSO₃ is not suitable for the first reaction, as it does not provide the necessary acidic conditions for cyanohydrin formation.
- **Option D**: A = NaHSO₃, B = CH₃COOH. Neither reagent is suitable for the respective reactions.

Thus, the correct answer is **Option A**, where A = H₃O⁺ and B = HCl.

Answer: A
