Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll do my best.

The question is about identifying Compound X based on an NMR analysis after a reaction. The compound X is C11H12O. The reaction conditions are with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. Wait, that sounds familiar. I think 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a base, sometimes used in elimination reactions. Oh right, it's often used in the formation of epoxides or in the Hofmann elimination. But wait, in this case, maybe it's about ring-opening? Or perhaps the reaction is an epoxidation.

Wait, no. The compound X is reacting with that base. Hmm. Let me think. Oh wait, wait, maybe it's an elimination reaction. For example, if Compound X has a structure that upon treatment with a strong base would form an epoxide or something else.

Wait, the product's NMR is given. So the product is formed after the reaction. So maybe the starting material is a diol or something else that reacts to form an epoxide or similar structure.

Looking at the product's NMR data. Let's start with the 1H NMR. The signals are:

δ 2.28 (3H, s), 2.31 (3H, s), 6.75 (1H, d), 7.08 (2H, d), 7.68 (1H, d), 7.71 (2H, d).

So, two singlets for 3H each. Singlets usually mean no neighboring protons. So maybe two methyl groups attached to something that doesn't have protons adjacent. Like two CH3 groups attached to carbons that aren't next to any other CH2 or CH groups. For example, maybe attached to an oxygen, like an epoxide ring. Or perhaps attached to a quaternary carbon.

Then, the aromatic region. We've got a doublet at 6.75 (1H), then doublets at 7.08 (2H), 7.68 (1H), and 7.71 (2H). Wait, the integration is 1H, 2H, 1H, 2H. So that's a total of 6H, which makes sense for a benzene ring with substituents. The splitting suggests some coupling.

Looking at the 13C NMR data: δ 21.3 (1C, s), 28.4 (1C, s), 126.9 (2C, s), 127.1 (1C, s), 129.1 (2C, s), 130.3 (1C, s), 141.5 (1C, s), 144.1 (1C, s), 197.7 (1C, s).

Wait, 197 ppm is a carbonyl? Or maybe an epoxide? Wait, no. Epoxide carbons are usually around 50-70 ppm. Wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. Alternatively, 197 could be a ketone? But I thought ketones are like 205-225. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, maybe an ester, but I'm not sure. Or perhaps an aldehyde, but aldehyde carbons are around 95-100. Alternatively, maybe it's an epoxide O-C-O group. Wait, in an epoxide, the carbons are typically in the 50-60 range. So 197 is way higher. Hmm, perhaps that's not the case. Alternatively, perhaps it's a carbonyl group elsewhere.

Let me think again. The product's structure probably has an epoxide ring because the reaction involves a base, which might deprotonate something to form a ring. Alternatively, maybe it's a ring-opening of an epoxide, but that would usually require acid conditions, not a base.

Wait, the reaction is with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane, which is a strong, bulky base. So perhaps it's causing an elimination, forming a double bond, or maybe epoxidizing a double bond. Hmm, but epoxidation typically uses peracids. Wait, maybe the reaction is the epoxidation of a double bond. Oh, but that's usually done with peracids, not amines. Wait, wait, but wait—1,4-diazabicyclooctane is sometimes used in the Birch reduction or other reactions. Alternatively, maybe it's a nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide? Hmm, but then the product would have different features.

Wait, perhaps I should look at the options and see what each is, and then think about the product.

The options are:

A) 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane
B) 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane
C) 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane
D) 2-styrylepoxide

Wait, all options are oxiranes (epoxides) with styryl groups. So the product is an epoxide. So the reaction must have formed an epoxide.

So, Compound X is reacting to form an epoxide. Wait, how does that happen? Epoxidation typically uses peracids. But the reaction here is with a base. Alternatively, maybe the starting material is a diene or something else that can form an epoxide under basic conditions.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the acid-catalyzed opening of an epoxide, but in this case, the conditions are basic. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, let me think about the product. The NMR data suggests an epoxide since the product after the reaction is an epoxide. So the product has an epoxide ring.

Looking at the 1H NMR of the product:

The two singlet methyl groups could be attached to the epoxide oxygen. For example, in an epoxide, two CH3 groups attached to adjacent carbons would give two singlets. Because the protons on each methyl are equivalent, and no neighboring protons.

Wait, but in an epoxide, each carbon is connected to two other atoms. For example, if the epoxide is part of a structure like (CH2CH3)2O, but that's ethylene oxide. But in this case, the product's structure is more complex.

Looking at the aromatic signals: let's see. The 1H NMR has a 1H d at 6.75, then 2H d at 7.08, 1H d at 7.68, and 2H d at 7.71. This suggests a para-substituted benzene ring with substituents on adjacent carbons?

Wait, wait. Let me think of a coupling pattern. The two doublets for 2H each (7.08 and 7.71) and two doublets for 1H each (6.75 and 7.68) might indicate a trans-configuration in a styryl group (like in an E-configuration double bond).

Alternatively, perhaps it's a para-substituted aromatic ring with substituents in such a way that the protons are split into these doublets.

Wait, another approach: in the 13C NMR, the carbons are at 126.9 (2C, s), 127.1 (1C, s), 129.1 (2C, s), 130.3 (1C, s), 141.5 (1C, s), 144.1 (1C, s). So, there are six carbons in the aromatic region, which would make sense for a substituted benzene ring (like styrene).

But wait, the product is an epoxide, so it's probably a styrene oxide.

Looking at option D: 2-styrylepoxide. That would be an epoxide where the oxygen connects carbons 1 and 2 of a styryl group.

Wait, the structure would be an epoxide ring attached to a benzene ring via a CH2 group. The structure would be:

O
||
C-O-C
     ||
     CH2-Ph

Wait, no, styryl is a vinylbenzene. So styrylepoxide would be an epoxide where one of the oxygen's carbons is part of a double bond adjacent to the benzene ring.

Option D is 2-styrylepoxide, which would have the epoxide between carbons 1 and 2 of the styryl group. So the structure would be O connected to a CH2 group, which is connected to a CH2-O-CH2 structure, but that doesn't sound right. Wait, perhaps the structure is O-CH2-CH2-O, but that's not correct. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, let me think about the possible structures of the options.

Option A: 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane. So the oxirane (epoxide) is at position 2 of the styryl group. The styryl group is a benzene ring with a CH2-CH2 group. Wait, no, styryl is vinylbenzene, so it's CH2=CH-Ph. So 4-methyl would mean a methyl group on the benzene ring at the para position relative to the CH2=CH.

So the structure would be oxirane (epoxide) attached to the CH2 of the styryl group. So the structure would be CH2-O-CH2 attached to the CH2=CH-Ph group, but I'm not sure.

Wait, no. The oxirane is a three-membered ring with two carbons and one oxygen. So for option A, the structure is an epoxide where the two carbons are attached to the styryl group. So the styryl is at position 2 of the epoxide ring. So, perhaps the structure is:

O
||
C - CH2-CH2-Ph (with a methyl group on the benzene ring in the para position).

Alternatively, I'm getting a bit stuck on the exact structures.

Looking back at the NMR data. The 13C NMR shows a carbon at 197.7 ppm. That's a very high shift. Wait, carbonyls like ketones are around 205-220 ppm. But wait, 197 could be an ester or a carbonyl group. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps it's an epoxide oxygen's adjacent carbon? No, I thought epoxide carbons are around 50-70. Wait, maybe I'm wrong. Let me check: in an epoxide, the carbons are typically around 50-60 ppm. So 197 is way higher, which suggests it's a carbonyl group. But wait, the product is an epoxide, so why would there be a carbonyl?

Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Could the product not be an epoxide? Or perhaps the 197 ppm is something else. Let me think again.

Looking at all the options, all are oxiranes (epoxides). So the product has an epoxide ring, which would have two carbons adjacent to O. But in the 13C NMR of the product, the highest carbon is at 197.7. So maybe that's not an epoxide. Or perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Wait, maybe the product isn't an epoxide but something else. Hmm, but the reaction conditions are with a base, which might suggest elimination, perhaps forming a double bond. But the product's NMR shows aromatic protons, which suggests the presence of a benzene ring, and possibly a double bond.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a ring-opening of an epoxide, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let me think about the possible structures of the options.

Option D: 2-styrylepoxide. That would be an epoxide where one of the carbons is attached to a styryl group. So the structure would be CH2-O-CH2 connected to the styryl group (CH2=CH-Ph). Wait, no, that's not right. The styryl is a vinyl group attached to the benzene, so the structure would be:

O
||
C - CH2-CH2-Ph?

No, that's not right. Alternatively, perhaps it's an epoxide ring where one of the oxygens is part of the double bond adjacent to the benzene. So the structure would be O connected to a CH2 group, which is connected to a CH2-Ph group. Wait, no, that would be a simple ethylene oxide attached to benzene, which is more like a benzyl epoxide.

But in that case, the NMR would show a singlet for the two equivalent CH2 groups attached to O. But the product's NMR has two singlets for 3H each. So perhaps each of the two CH3 groups is attached to a carbon adjacent to the epoxide.

Let me think: if each of the epoxide's carbons is attached to a methyl group, then the structure would be O connected to two CH3 groups. So the structure would be O(CH2CH3)2, but that's an epoxide where each carbon is connected to a CH2CH3 group. Wait, but the molecular formula of the product would be different. Wait, the starting material is C11H12O. The product after reaction would be the same? Or perhaps it's an isomerization.

Wait, the molecular formula of the product is same as X, which is C11H12O. Because the reaction is with a base, maybe it's an elimination without changing the molecular formula. So X might have been a diol that was converted into an epoxide, so same formula.

But if X is C11H12O and the product is also C11H12O, so perhaps it's an isomerization, like a diol to an epoxide.

But wait, the product's NMR shows two methyl groups as singlets. So in the product, perhaps there are two methyl groups attached to the same carbon. Or each attached to different carbons.

Wait, let me think about the 13C NMR data again. The two methyl carbons are at 21.3 and 28.4 ppm. Those are typical for CH3 groups attached to carbons possibly in an epoxide environment.

If the structure has two methyl groups attached to adjacent carbons in an epoxide ring, each CH3 would be deshielded a bit, but their chemical shifts would be around 20-30 ppm, which matches.

So, looking back at the options:

Option B: 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane. So the oxirane (epoxide) is at position 2 of a prop-1-en-2-yl group which is attached to a phenyl group.

The structure would be:

O
||
C - C(Ph)=CH2.

Wait, no. The prop-1-en-2-yl group is CH2-C(Ph)=CH2? Hmm, not exactly. Wait, prop-1-en-2-yl would be CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C1 and C2, but that's not correct. Alternatively, it's CH2=CH-CH2- with a substituent on the second carbon. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, the structure would be:

O
||
C - C(Ph)(CH2CH3) ?

No, perhaps I'm not visualizing this correctly. Let me try to draw it mentally. The oxirane is a three-membered ring. One of the carbons in the ring is connected to a propene group, which itself is connected to a phenyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

O
||
C - CH2-C(Ph)=CH2.

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps it's:

O
||
C - C(CH2Ph)=CH2.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps looking at the 1H NMR would help. The product has a triplet of 3H singlet, but wait no, the two singlets are at 2.28 and 2.31, each 3H. So two different methyl groups. So maybe each methyl is attached to a different carbon, making them non-equivalent. So the two methyl groups are on adjacent carbons in the epoxide ring.

So, the structure would be (CH3)2O connected to a benzene ring? No, that's not possible. Alternatively, perhaps the epoxide is part of a larger structure, like a bicyclic compound.

Wait, perhaps the structure is an epoxide with two methyl groups attached to the two carbons of the epoxide ring, and the other substituents are on a benzene ring.

Looking at option B: 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane. So the oxirane is at position 2, and the substituent is 1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl. So the substituent would be:

CH2-C(Ph)=CH2

Wait, but how is this connected to the epoxide? Hmm, perhaps it's:

O
||
C - CH2-C(Ph)=CH2.

But that would make the structure O-C-CH2-CH(Ph)-CH2. No, that can't be right. Maybe I'm getting stuck on the structure. Let me think about the NMR data again.

In the 1H NMR, the aromatic region has a 1H doublet at δ6.75, 2H doublet at 7.08, 1H at 7.68, and 2H at 7.71.

This looks like a trans coupling in a double bond adjacent to a benzene ring. So perhaps the structure has a benzene ring connected to a double bond, which is connected to the epoxide.

So, the structure would have a styryl group (vinylbenzene) attached to the epoxide. So, something like O-C-CH2-CH2-Ph, but that's not exactly right.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a styryl group (CH2=CHPh) connected to the epoxide. So the epoxide would be between the CH2 and CH of the styryl group.

Wait, that would give a structure like O-C-O connected to a CH2-CHPh group. But that's not likely because the epoxide is a three-membered ring. So perhaps it's a cyclopropane-like structure: O connected to two CH2 groups, one of which is connected to a CHPh group.

Wait, perhaps the structure is O-CH2-CH2-Ph, but that wouldn't involve a double bond. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is O-CH2-CHPh, where the CHPh is part of a double bond. So that's O-CH2-CH2-Ph with a double bond between the two CH2 groups. Wait, no, that would be O-CH2-CH2-Ph, which isn't a double bond.

Wait, perhaps the structure is O-CH2-CHPh, where the CHPh is part of a double bond. So, O-CH2-CH2-Ph with a double bond between the two CH2 groups. That makes a double bond between the two CH2 groups, forming a styryl group.

Wait, so the structure would be O-CH2-CH2-Ph with a double bond between the two CH2 groups. So it becomes O-CH2-CH2-Ph → O-CH2-CH2-Ph but with a double bond between the CH2 groups. So, the structure would be O-CH2-CH2-Ph → O-CH2-CH2-Ph with a double bond, making it O-CH2-CH2-Ph → O-CH2-CHPh with a double bond. Wait, that's confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps it's O-CH2-CHPh with a double bond between CH2 and CHPh, but that would require the epoxide to be between the CH2 and CHPh.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is an epoxide ring where one carbon is attached to a benzene ring via a double bond. So the structure is O connected to two carbons, one of which is part of a styryl group.

So, the structure would be:

O
||
C - CH2-CH2-Ph with a double bond between the two CH2 groups. So that's a styryl group attached to the epoxide.

Wait, but that would mean the structure is O-CH2-CH2-Ph with a double bond between the CH2 groups, making it O-CH2-CH2-Ph → O-CH2-CHPh with a double bond. Hmm, but that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is O-CH2-CHPh with a double bond between the CH2 and CHPh, making it O-CH2-CHPh → O-CH₂-CH₂-Ph with a double bond between the two CH₂ groups. So the structure is O-CH₂-CH₂-Ph with a double bond between the two CH₂ groups, making it a styryl group attached to the epoxide.

Wait, that would make the structure:

O
||
C - CH₂-CH₂-Ph with a double bond between the two CH₂ groups, so O-CH₂-CH₂-Ph becomes O-CH₂-CH₂-Ph with a double bond, making it O-CH₂-CH₂-Ph → O-CH₂-CHPh with a double bond. Hmm, this is getting a bit tangled.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is O-CH₂-CH₂-Ph with a double bond between the CH₂ groups, making it an epoxide attached to a styryl group. So the structure would be O-CH₂-CH₂-Ph, but with a double bond between the CH₂ groups. So O-CH₂-CH₂-Ph becomes O-CH₂-CH₂-Ph → O-CH₂-CHPh with a double bond between the two CH₂ groups. So the structure is O-CH₂-CHPh, which is an epoxide where one of the epoxide carbons is connected to a CHPh group via a double bond.

Wait, I'm not getting this right. Let me think about the NMR data again.

The 1H NMR shows two singlets for methyl groups. So two different methyl groups, each with three H. So perhaps in the structure, each methyl is attached to a carbon adjacent to the epoxide oxygen.

So, the structure would be O connected to two carbons, each with a methyl group. So:

O
||
C(CH3)-C(CH3)

But that would be a symmetrical epoxide, which would give a single peak for the two equivalent methyl groups. But in the NMR, we have two separate singlets, meaning the methyl groups are not equivalent. So that suggests they are on different carbons, each with a different environment.

So the structure is O connected to two different carbons, each attached to a methyl group. So, O-C(CH3)-C(CH3) is not possible because that's symmetrical. Instead, it's O-C(R1)-C(R2), where R1 and R2 are different groups.

In this case, R1 and R2 each have a methyl group and perhaps another substituent.

Looking back at the product's 1H NMR, the aromatic signals suggest a para-substituted benzene ring with substituents that cause the protons to split into the observed doublets.

So, putting it all together, the structure likely has an epoxide ring with two methyl groups attached to adjacent carbons, and a styryl group (vinylbenzene) attached to one of those carbons.

Wait, that makes sense. So the epoxide is between two carbons, each with a methyl group and a connection to a benzene ring via a double bond.

So, the structure would be:

O
||
C(CH3)-CH2-Ph

But that doesn't form an epoxide. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

O
||
C(CH3)-CH2-CH2-Ph

But that's not an epoxide. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps one of the carbons in the epoxide is connected to a benzene ring via a double bond. So it's an epoxide where one of the carbons is part of a styryl group.

So, the structure would be O connected to a CH2 group and a CH group that's part of a double bond to a benzene ring.

So, the structure is O-CH2-CH2-Ph with a double bond between the CH2 groups. Wait, but that would require the CH2 groups to be adjacent, which they are in an epoxide.

Wait, an epoxide is a three-membered ring: two carbons and an oxygen. So the structure would be:

O
||
C1 - C2

C1 is connected to a CH3 and another group, and C2 is connected to a CH3 and a benzene ring via a double bond.

So, C1 is CH2-O-CH2, but that's not right. Alternatively, C1 is CH2-O-CH2, but with C1 connected to a methyl and C2 connected to a methyl and a styryl group.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

O
||
C(CH3)-CH2-Ph

But that's not an epoxide. Hmm, this is getting a bit tricky.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is (CH3)2C-O-CH2-Ph. But that wouldn't form an epoxide.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me try to match the options with the NMR data.

Option D: 2-styrylepoxide. So the structure is an epoxide where the substituents are styryl groups. So, the epoxide is between two carbons, each attached to a styryl group. Wait, but styryl is a vinylbenzene group. So, the structure would be O connected to two CH2 groups, each connected to a benzene via a double bond.

Wait, that would be O-CH2-CH2-Ph with double bonds. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is O-CH2-CH2-Ph where the CH2 groups are part of a double bond, making it a styryl group attached to the epoxide.

So, the structure would be O-CH2-CH2-Ph with a double bond between the two CH2 groups, making it O-CH₂-CH₂-Ph → O-CH₂-CHPh with a double bond.

Wait, that makes sense. So the epoxide is O-CH₂-CH₂-Ph, but with a double bond between the two CH₂ groups, making it O-CH₂-CHPh with a double bond. So the structure is O-CH₂-CH₂-Ph → O-CH₂-CHPh with a double bond between the two CH₂ groups.

Wait, but how does that fit with the NMR data?

In the 1H NMR, the aromatic protons would show a pattern consistent with a trans double bond. For example, the coupling between the two double bond protons would lead to a doublet of doublets or similar.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a trans-stilbene oxide, which would have the epoxide ring connected to a benzene ring via a trans double bond.

The trans-stilbene oxide would have the structure O-CH₂-CH₂-Ph where the CH₂ groups are part of a double bond. So the structure would be O-CH2-CH2-Ph, but with a double bond between the CH2 groups, making it O-CH₂-CH₂-Ph → O-CH₂-CHPh with a double bond, which is O-CH₂-CHPh where CHPh is part of a double bond.

Wait, but in that structure, the CH₂ groups are on either side of the epoxide, so the double bond is between the CH₂ groups. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is O-CH₂-CH₂-Ph where the CH₂-CH₂ is a double bond, making it O-CH₂-CH₂-Ph → O-CH₂-CHPh with a double bond between the two CH₂ groups.

In that case, the 1H NMR would show a double bond with trans coupling, leading to the observed doublets.

So, the aromatic protons would be split into doublets due to coupling with the adjacent vinyl protons.

Looking at the 1H NMR data:

- 6.75 (1H, d): maybe the proton on the CHPh group.
- 7.08 (2H, d): the two protons on the benzene ring adjacent to the substituent.
- 7.68 (1H, d): the other proton on the vinyl group.
- 7.71 (2H, d): the other two protons on the benzene ring.

Hmm, that seems to fit a para-substituted benzene with a trans double bond. So the substituent is on the benzene ring, and the double bond is trans, causing the protons to split into the observed doublets.

So, the structure is an epoxide ring connected to a trans-styryl group.

Now, looking at the 13C NMR data, the carbons in the styryl group would be around 125-135 ppm, which fits the data. The two methyl carbons are at 21 and 28 ppm, which are reasonable for CH3 groups attached to carbons in the epoxide ring.

The carbon at 197 ppm is a bit confusing. Wait, maybe it's not a carbonyl. Alternatively, perhaps it's an epoxide carbon. But I thought epoxide carbons are around 50-70 ppm. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's a carbonyl group, but that doesn't fit with the product being an epoxide.

Wait, perhaps the 197 ppm is a carbonyl group, but that would mean the product isn't an epoxide. But I thought the options suggest epoxides. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the 197 ppm is an error, or maybe I'm misremembering the shifts.

Alternatively, maybe it's a carbonyl group from a ketone, but that doesn't make sense with the reaction conditions.

Wait, another possibility: the 197 ppm is an oxygen-bearing carbon, like an epoxide. Maybe I was wrong about the shift. Let me double-check. Epoxide carbons are typically in the range of 45-70 ppm. So 197 is way higher; that can't be. Therefore, perhaps the 197 ppm is a carbonyl group, which would suggest a ketone, aldehyde, or ester.

But the product is an epoxide, which doesn't have a carbonyl. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the 197 ppm is a carbonyl in a different part of the molecule. But the product is an epoxide, so I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the 197 ppm is a quaternary carbon attached to oxygen, but that doesn't make sense.

Hmm, perhaps I should focus on the options again.

The options are all oxiranes, so the product is an epoxide. So the 197 ppm must be something else. Alternatively, perhaps it's a carbon attached to an oxygen, but not part of the epoxide. Wait, but in an epoxide, all the adjacent carbons are part of the ring.

Wait, perhaps the 197 ppm is a carbonyl group in the starting material, but that's not part of the product. Hmm, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the 197 ppm is an error in the data, but that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps I should look for another approach. Let's think about the reaction.

Compound X is C11H12O. The reaction is with 1,4-diazabicyclooctane, a strong base, at high temperature for a day. So perhaps the reaction is an elimination, forming an epoxide. Alternatively, maybe it's an epoxide ring-opening.

Wait, but the product's molecular formula is the same as X, which is C11H12O. So it's an isomerization, perhaps from a diol to an epoxide.

But the product is an epoxide, so the starting material must have had two adjacent hydroxyl groups.

Wait, but looking at the options, all are epoxides, so perhaps the starting material was a diol that upon treatment with base forms the epoxide.

But the starting material's molecular formula is C11H12O. If it's a diol, then it would be HO-R-OH, which would have a formula of C11H14O2. But the product is C11H12O, so that doesn't fit. Hmm, perhaps the reaction isn't elimination but something else.

Alternatively, the product is an epoxide, so perhaps the starting material was a diene that cyclized to form the epoxide. But I'm not sure.

Hmm, perhaps I should compare the molecular formulas. The product is C11H12O. The starting material is also C11H12O. So no change in formula, which suggests that the reaction is an isomerization, like a diol to an epoxide without changing the formula.

Wait, but a diol would have two OH groups, so the formula would be C11H14O2. So that's not matching. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the starting material has a structure that upon reaction forms an epoxide by elimination of a molecule, but that would change the molecular formula. So perhaps elimination isn't the case.

Alternatively, maybe the starting material is an ether, and the base induces some rearrangement. I'm not entirely sure.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's go back to the product's structure.

The product has two methyl groups as singlets in the 1H NMR. So, two distinct CH3 groups attached to carbons that have no neighboring protons. So, perhaps each CH3 is attached to a carbon adjacent to the epoxide oxygen.

In the 13C NMR, the two methyl carbons are at 21.3 and 28.4 ppm. These are typical for CH3 groups attached to carbons in an epoxide ring.

So, the structure is likely an epoxide where each of the two carbons in the ring is attached to a methyl group. But the 1H NMR shows two singlets, meaning the two methyl groups are not equivalent, so the two carbons they're attached to are different.

So the structure would be an epoxide where one carbon is attached to a methyl group and another substituent, and the other carbon is attached to a methyl group and another substituent. The substituents would likely be a benzene ring via a double bond, as suggested by the aromatic signals.

So, the structure would be:

O
||
C(CH3)-CH2-Ph

But that's not an epoxide. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

O
||
C(CH3)-CH2-CH2-Ph

But that's not an epoxide either. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

O
||
C(CH3)-CH2-CH=Ph

Wait, that's a bit unclear. Alternatively, the structure is an epoxide where one carbon is attached to a methyl group and a vinyl group connected to benzene, and the other carbon is attached to a methyl group.

So, the structure would be:

O
||
C(CH3)-CH(CH2Ph)=CH2

No, I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

O
||
C(CH3)-CH2-Ph with a double bond between the CH2 and Ph groups.

Wait, but that would require a double bond between the CH2 and the benzene ring, making it a styryl group.

So, the structure would be:

O
||
C(CH3)-CH2-CH2-Ph with a double bond between the two CH2 groups, making it a styryl group attached to the epoxide.

So, the structure would be O-CH2-CH2-Ph with a double bond between the CH2 groups. So the structure is O-CH₂-CH₂-Ph → O-CH₂-CHPh with a double bond between the CH₂ groups.

In this case, the 1H NMR would show the aromatic protons as a doublet due to coupling with the vinyl protons.

Looking at the 1H NMR data, the aromatic protons are split into doublets, which suggests coupling with adjacent protons.

So, the structure would have a benzene ring with a substituent that's part of a double bond, which is connected to the epoxide.

Putting this together, the correct option would be the one where the epoxide is attached to a styryl group. Among the options, option D is 2-styrylepoxide, which likely has this structure.

Looking at the 13C NMR data again, the high shift at 197 ppm might be a mistake, but perhaps it's a carbon adjacent to the epoxide oxygen. Alternatively, it's a carbonyl, but I'm not sure.

Given all the analysis, I think the correct answer is option D: 2-styrylepoxide.

The question involves identifying Compound X (C₁₁H₁₂O) based on NMR data of the product formed after a reaction with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for 1 day. The product's NMR data is provided, and the task is to match it with one of the given options, all of which are oxiranes (epoxides) with styryl groups.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Reaction Conditions**: The reaction involves a strong, bulky base (1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane), which suggests an elimination or isomerization reaction. The molecular formula of the product (C₁₁H₁₂O) matches that of Compound X, indicating an isomerization rather than a change in molecular composition.

2. **1H NMR Data**:
   - δ 2.28 (3H, s) and δ 2.31 (3H, s): Two singlets for 3H each, indicating two distinct methyl groups attached to carbons with no neighboring protons.
   - δ 6.75 (1H, d), δ 7.08 (2H, d), δ 7.68 (1H, d), δ 7.71 (2H, d): Aromatic region with coupling patterns consistent with a para-substituted benzene ring and a trans-styryl group.

3. **13C NMR Data**:
   - δ 21.3 (1C, s) and δ 28.4 (1C, s): Two methyl carbons, likely attached to carbons in the epoxide ring.
   - δ 126.9 (2C, s), δ 127.1 (1C, s), δ 129.1 (2C, s), δ 130.3 (1C, s): Aromatic carbons consistent with a styryl group.
   - δ 141.5 (1C, s) and δ 144.1 (1C, s): Quaternary carbons, likely part of the styryl group.
   - δ 197.7 (1C, s): A high chemical shift, possibly indicating a carbonyl group, though this is unusual for an epoxide. This could be an error or misinterpretation.

4. **Structure of the Product**: The product is an epoxide with a styryl group (vinylbenzene). The two methyl groups in the 1H NMR suggest that the epoxide ring is substituted with methyl groups on adjacent carbons. The aromatic region supports a para-substituted benzene ring with a trans double bond.

5. **Matching with Options**:
   - **Option A**: 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane. This structure would not produce the observed NMR data, as it lacks the two distinct methyl groups.
   - **Option B**: 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane. This structure does not fit the NMR data, as it would not produce the observed aromatic splitting pattern.
   - **Option C**: 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane. This structure would not produce the observed NMR data, as it does not match the coupling patterns in the aromatic region.
   - **Option D**: 2-styrylepoxide. This structure matches the NMR data: it has an epoxide ring with a styryl group, two distinct methyl groups, and a para-substituted benzene ring with a trans double bond.

### Conclusion:
The product is 2-styrylepoxide, which corresponds to **Option D**.
