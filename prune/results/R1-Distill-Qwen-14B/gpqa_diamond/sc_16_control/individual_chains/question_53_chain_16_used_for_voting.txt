Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the right answer. Let me read through it again and break it down step by step. Hmm, the question is about identifying a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound based on its FTIR and 1H NMR spectra. The options are four different chemical formulas. Alright, let's start by analyzing the given information.

First, the FTIR shows a peak for an ester group. That makes me think there's an ester functional group in the molecule. Esters typically have a carbonyl group (C=O), which would show up around 1700-1750 cm⁻¹ in the IR spectrum. So, the compound has an ester, which could be part of a substituent on the aromatic ring.

Now, looking at the 1H NMR data. There are six signals in total. Let's parse them:

1. Two signals for aromatic-H. So, the aromatic ring has two sets of protons, each with a different environment. Since it's a di-substituted benzene ring, the substituents must be in positions that cause the protons to split into two different sets. For example, if the substituents are para to each other, the ring might have two equivalent sets of protons, but that usually leads to fewer signals. Alternatively, if the substituents are ortho or meta, that could create two distinct sets.

Wait, no, di-substituted rings have specific splitting patterns. Let me think: If the substituents are para, then the ring is symmetrical, so maybe there are two equivalent sets of H. For example, in para-substituted benzene, the protons ortho to substituents would be equivalent, and the meta would as well. But wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, if the substituents are in such a way that there are two different types of aromatic protons, like in ortho positions. Hmm, perhaps the ring has two substituents that are not symmetrical, leading to two types of H.

Wait, but the NMR shows two signals for aromatic-H. That suggests two different types of aromatic protons. So maybe the substituents are such that the ring has two sets of equivalent H's. For di-substituted benzene, if the substituents are meta, there would be two sets of equivalent H's. Alternatively, if they are para, the ring would have two equivalent sets (ortho to substituents) and another set of two equivalent (meta), but perhaps only two signals if the substituents are such that some symmetry is present. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here. Maybe I should think about the structure more.

2. Two signals corresponding to vinyl-H. One is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets. Vinyl protons are typically those on a double bond, like in an alkene or an aromatic ring. But since the aromatic ring is already substituted, perhaps the vinyl protons are part of an substituent, like an ester group. Wait, esters don't have vinyl protons. Oh, wait, perhaps the substituent is an ester with a vinyl group attached. Or maybe it's part of a substituent like an allyl group? Alternatively, maybe the substituents are ester groups attached via a vinyl group.

Wait, I'm not sure. Let's think: Ester groups are typically R-O-CO-R. So, the ester group itself wouldn't have vinyl protons unless the R groups have double bonds. So, perhaps the substituent on the benzene ring is an ester group attached via an ethyl group or something else.

Alternatively, maybe the substituents are vinyl esters. Hmm.

Wait, let me think about the NMR signals. The vinyl-Hs: one is a doublet (so each is split into two peaks, perhaps from coupling with one neighboring proton), and the other is a doublet of quartets (so each H is split into 4 peaks, or maybe each H is split by two different couplings, resulting in a more complex multiplet). Hmm, perhaps these are part of a conjugated system, like adjacent to a carbonyl group.

3. Two signals for -CH3 groups. And there are no signals for -CH2 groups. So, the molecule must have two methyl groups (-CH3), and no methylene groups (-CH2-). That suggests that any substituents with -CH2- groups are either absent or perhaps in a different part of the molecule where the protons are not split into separate signals. Alternatively, maybe the substituents are such that any -CH2- groups are in a symmetric environment, leading to a singlet. But wait, the question states that there are no signals for -CH2 groups, so maybe the substituents don't contain any methylene groups.

So, putting it together, the molecule has an aromatic ring with two substituents, an ester group, and two methyl groups, with no methylene groups.

Wait, but how do the substituents look? Let's think about possible structures. Let's imagine the benzene ring with two substituents, each of which is an ester group attached through some structure. But wait, if each substituent is an ester, that would be two ester groups, but the question says the FTIR shows an ester group, not necessarily two. Hmm, perhaps the substituent is an ester group, and the other substituent is something else that includes a methyl group.

Wait, but the options have O2 as part of their formula. So the ester would contribute two oxygen atoms (since an ester is O from the alcohol and another O from the acid part, so the formula would have two O's). So the O2 in the formula is accounted for by the ester group.

So, the structure probably has the benzene ring with two substituents, one of which is an ester group, and perhaps another substituent that contributes the methyl groups.

Wait, but the NMR shows two signals for -CH3. That suggests two different methyl groups. But wait, if the substituent is a methyl ester, like OMe, then that would only account for one methyl group. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is something else, like a vinyl group attached to an ester or a group with two methyls.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a methoxycarbonyl group, like OMe-CO-O-R, but that might complicate things.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is an ester with a propenyl group or something with vinyl protons. Let me think about a possible structure.

Let me think of possible structures. For example, suppose the benzene ring has two substituents: one is an ester group, and the other substituent is an allyl group (which would have vinyl protons). Wait, but allyl groups would have CH2-CH2-CH2, but that would include CH2 groups, which the NMR doesn't show. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a vinyl ester, like the ester is attached to a vinyl group. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about the degrees of unsaturation. The chemical formulas given are:

A) C11H14O2 → Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU) = (2C +2 - H -X +N)/2. Assuming no X or N here. So DoU for A: (2*11 +2 -14 -0)/2 → (24-14)/2=5. So 5 DoU.

Similarly for D) C11H12O2 → DoU = (22 +2 -12)/2= (24-12)/2=6.

Wait, benzene ring is 3 DoU (as it's a six-membered ring with three double bonds in the aromatic structure). So if the ring is 3 DoU, the substituents must account for the rest.

Since the compound is di-substituted, each substituent could bring in more DoU. For example, an ester group has a carbonyl (1 DoU), and perhaps the substituent is attached via a double bond (another DoU), etc.

Wait, let's take each option and compute DoU.

Option A: C11H14O2 → DoU=5.

Option D: C11H12O2 → DoU=6.

Wait, but the benzene ring is 3 DoU. So substituents must contribute the remaining.

For option D: 6-3=3 DoU in substituents.

So substituents must have 3 DoU. So each substituent (two of them) must have a total of 3 DoU.

Possible substituents: each substituent is an ester group. An ester group is R-O-CO-R'. So, the ester group has a carbonyl (1 DoU). If R is a methyl group, methyl ester (like OMe-CO-), but that doesn't add any more DoU. Alternatively, if R is a vinyl group, which is a double bond, that adds another DoU.

Wait, for example, if one substituent is a vinyl ester, like CH2=CHCO2R, then that would contribute two DoU: one from the ester carbonyl and one from the vinyl group. So each substituent would have 2 DoU. Two substituents would contribute 4 DoU. But the benzene ring is 3, so total DoU is 7, but the formula for D is 6. Hmm, that doesn't add up.

Alternatively, perhaps one substituent is an ester (1 DoU), and the other substituent is a vinyl group (1 DoU), so total substituent DoU is 2. Then total DoU would be 3 (benzene) + 2 =5, which would match option A (DoU=5).

Wait, but wait: the NMR shows two vinyl-H signals. So if one substituent is a vinyl group, that could account for those signals. But the substituent would need to be a vinyl group attached to something else, like an ester.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an ester with a vinyl group attached. For example, an allyl ester: O-CO-CH2-CH2-CH2-O-R. No, that wouldn't have vinyl protons. Alternatively, a propenoate ester: O-CO-CH2-CH=CH2. That would have a double bond adjacent to the ester.

So, for example, a substituent could be an allyloxy group (O-CH2-CH=CH2), but that's an ether, not an ester. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a propenoyloxy group, O-CO-CH2-CH=CH2. No, that would be an ester. But wait, maybe I'm complicating this.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl acetate group. For example, the ester could be like OAc (acetyloxy) attached to a vinyl group. Hmm, but how would that structure look?

Wait, perhaps it's better to think about the NMR signals.

The aromatic-H signals: two signals, so two different types of H. So the substituents must be in such a way that the ring has two sets of Hs. For example, if the substituents are para, then the ring would have two sets of equivalent Hs (each ortho and meta). Wait, no: in para-substituted benzene, the ring is symmetric, so the Hs are all equivalent except for those adjacent to substituents. Wait, no, when you have two substituents para to each other, the ring becomes more symmetric. Let me think: if substituents are para, then the ortho positions are equivalent, and the meta positions are equivalent. So the ring would have two sets of Hs. So the NMR would show two signals for aromatic Hs, each integrating for two H each (assuming each substituent is the same). But wait, in this case, the substituents are different (because one is an ester and the other is something else), or perhaps both are the same? No, because in the NMR, there are two different signals. So the substituents may be different.

Wait, but in a di-substituted ring with two different substituents, the aromatic Hs would split into more signals. For example, if substituents are meta, then the ring would have three sets of Hs, but that's getting complicated. Alternatively, if the substituents are in a way that creates only two unique H environments, perhaps when one substituent is in a position that makes some Hs equivalent.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are in the para positions and are the same, but that would make the ring have two sets of equivalent Hs, but if the substituents are different, then perhaps the ring has four distinct Hs. Hmm, maybe I'm getting stuck here.

Let me think about the substituents. The substituent is an ester group, so perhaps it's –OOCR, where R is an alkyl group. The other substituent may have the –CH3 groups. Since the NMR shows two –CH3 signals, perhaps the substituent is a methyl group or something else. Alternatively, maybe one substituent is an ester (like OMe-CO-O-R), but that seems more complex.

Wait, the other substituent might be a methyl group. But then, the NMR would have a singlet for the methyl group attached to the ring, but since it's a di-substituted ring, the methyl substituent would be in a certain position relative to the ester substituent.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are an ester group and a methyl group attached ortho, meta, or para to each other. Let me think about the possible structures.

Suppose the ring has substituents at the para positions: one is an ester group (like OMeCO2-), and the other is a methyl group. Then, the aromatic Hs would be in positions that are equivalent in certain ways. For example, the Hs adjacent to the ester would be one set, and those adjacent to the methyl would be another set. But wait, if the substituents are para, then the Hs ortho to the ester would be equivalent, and the Hs meta to the ester would be another set. But if the substituents are different, that symmetry might be broken.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are in the meta positions, leading to two sets of Hs. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the possible structures given the NMR.

The vinyl-Hs: one is a doublet (so perhaps each H is coupled with one neighboring H), and the other is a doublet of quartets (so each H is coupled with two different Hs, perhaps in a more complex system).

Alternatively, think about a structure where the ester is part of a vinyl group. For example, the substituent is a vinyl ester, like CH2=CHCO2R. But then, the substituent would be an ester attached to a vinyl group, which could have the necessary vinyl protons. But wait, the substituent would be an ethyl group attached via double bond. So, the substituent would be a vinyl group attached to the ester.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an acetyloxy group (ester) and another substituent is a vinyl group. Let's say the benzene ring has –OAc (acetyloxy) and –CH2CH2– something? But that might include CH2 groups, which the NMR doesn't show.

Wait, but the NMR doesn't show any signals for CH2, so the substituents must not have any CH2 groups. So substituents must be either substituted with only CH3 and CH groups.

Hmm, considering that, perhaps the substituent is an ester group that's part of a vinyl group with a methyl group attached.

Wait, like for example, an allyl ester: O-CO-CH2-CH=CH2. But that would have a CH2 group, which we don't have signals for. So that's not possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an acetyloxy group (OAc) attached to a benzene ring, and the other substituent is a methyl group. But then, the NMR would only have one methyl signal (from OAc) and another from the methyl substituent. So two -CH3 signals, which matches the NMR data.

Wait, but then the substituents would be OAc and Me. Let's think about that structure.

So the benzene ring has an OAc group (–O–CO–Me) and a Me group. Then, the aromatic Hs would be split into two signals because of the substituents. The OAc substituent is an ester, which explains the IR peak. The Me group would give a singlet in the NMR (if it's attached to the ring). But wait, the NMR shows two signals for –CH3. So perhaps the substituents are two different methyl groups attached to the ring? But that would require the ring to have two methyl groups. Hmm, but the substituents are OAc and Me, so their methyl groups would be from the ester and the ring. So, the ester's methyl would be –O–CO–Me, and the ring's substituent is Me. Both would be –CH3, but are they in different environments? Yes, so they would show up as two separate signals in the NMR. That makes sense.

So, the structure would be a benzene ring with an OAc group (–O–CO–Me) and a Me group attached. The positions of these substituents would influence the NMR signals for the aromatic protons.

Now, let's think about the H NMR:

- Aromatic Hs: two signals, each integrating for two H. So the ring has two equivalent sets of Hs. If substituents are para, perhaps the ring's Hs are in such a way that two are equivalent, and the other two are another set. But wait, with two substituents, the ring would have four Hs in two sets of two each.

Alternatively, if the substituents are in the meta positions, the ring could have three Hs, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are ortho to each other, creating a more complex splitting.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are in such a way that the aromatic ring has two doublets. For example, if substituents are meta, the ring would have two sets of Hs—each adjacent to a substituent and each in a different environment.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are para, leading to two sets of equivalent aromatic Hs. For instance, the Hs adjacent to the OAc substituent would be one set, and those adjacent to the Me group would be another set. But if the substituents are para, then the ring would be symmetric, making the Hs adjacent to each substituent equivalent. Wait, no—because the substituents are different (OAc and Me), the Hs adjacent to each would be in different environments, leading to two different signals. So each substituent would have two Hs adjacent, but since the substituents are different, each set would split into two signals. Hmm, maybe that's how we get two signals for aromatic Hs.

But then, the vinyl Hs would need to come from another group. Wait, but in this structure, the OAc substituent is a single methyl group attached via an ester. So where are the vinyl Hs coming from? Oh wait, perhaps I'm missing something. The substituent could be an ester group attached to a vinyl group.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl ester, like –O–CO–CH2–CH2–CH2–, but that's an ether. No, that's not right. Alternatively, the substituent could be a propenoate ester, like –O–CO–CH2–CH=CH2. Then, the substituent on the ring would be an ester linked to a vinyl group, which would have the necessary vinyl protons.

In that case, the substituent would be –O–CO–CH2–CH=CH2. Let's consider that structure.

So, the benzene ring has substituents: one is this vinyl ester group, and the other substituent is a methyl group. That would account for the two –CH3 groups (one from the ester's methyl and one from the ring's methyl substituent). But wait, the ester's R group in this case is CH2–CH=CH2. So that group doesn't contribute any methyl groups. Wait, that's a problem because the NMR shows two –CH3 signals, so the substituents must each have a methyl group.

Hmm, perhaps the substituent is a methyl ester. For example, the substituent is –O–CO–Me, and the other substituent is –CH2–something. But no, that would introduce a –CH2– group, which is not present in the NMR.

Wait, let me think again. Since the NMR doesn't show any –CH2– signals, the substituents can't have any methylene groups. So any substituent attached via single bonds must not have any –CH2– groups.

So, perhaps the substituent is –O–CO–Me (acetyloxy), and another substituent is another –O–CO–Me group. But that would mean two ester substituents, and the aromatic Hs would have certain splitting. But then, the –CH3 groups would all be the same, so only one signal. But the NMR shows two –CH3 signals, so that can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are –O–CO–Me and –CH3. So the ring has two substituents: one is an ester (–O–CO–Me) and the other is a methyl group. Then, the –CH3 groups would be from the ester and the ring substituent, leading to two different signals because they're in different environments. That makes sense.

So, the structure would be benzene with –O–CO–Me and –CH3 substituents. Now, the positions of these substituents would influence the NMR signals.

Assuming the substituents are para, the ring would have two sets of aromatic protons: the Hs adjacent to –O–CO–Me and the Hs adjacent to –CH3. Each of these would be a doublet because they are adjacent to substituents. Wait, but in a para-substituted benzene with two different substituents, the Hs would be in two sets: each ortho pair would see different substituents, leading to two doublets in the NMR. So that would explain the two aromatic signals.

So, the aromatic Hs would be a doublet (say, for the Hs next to –O–CO–Me) and another doublet (for the Hs next to –CH3). That fits the NMR description.

Now, the vinyl protons: where are they coming from? Wait, in this structure, the substituents are –O–CO–Me and –CH3. Neither substituent has any vinyl protons. So that doesn't fit the NMR data, which shows two vinyl-H signals.

Ah, so this suggests that my initial assumption is incorrect. The substituents must include a vinyl group. So, perhaps the substituent isn't just –O–CO–Me but is part of a larger group that includes a vinyl structure.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a methyl ester attached via a vinyl group. For example, the substituent could be –O–CO–CH2–CH2–CH2–, but that would have –CH2– groups, which we don't have. Hmm.

Alternatively, the substituent could be –O–CO–CH2–CH=CH2. But that would have a –CH2– group, which is not allowed because the NMR doesn't show any –CH2 signals.

Wait a minute, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl ester. As in, the substituent is –O–CO–CH2–CH2–, but that's again –CH2–. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is –O–CO–CH=CH2. Then, the substituent would be an ester with a vinyl group attached.

So, the substituent would be –O–CO–CH2–CH2–, but that's not a vinyl group. Wait, a vinyl ester would be –O–CO–CH2–CH2–, no, that's not correct. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is –O–CO–CH=CH–R, but I'm getting a bit stuck.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propenoate ester: –O–CO–CH2–CH=CH2. But that would have a –CH2– group, which is not allowed. So that can't be.

Hmm, maybe the substituent is an acyloxy group attached to a vinyl group. For example, –O–CO–CH2–CH=CH– something, but that introduces –CH2– groups which we don't have.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a methylene group attached to the ester. But that would again have –CH2– groups.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl group itself, but that would be –CH2–CH2–, which isn't allowed. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a cyclopropenyl ester or something, but that's getting too complicated.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a benzyl ester, but that's a –CH2– group.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a propargyl ester, but that's an alkyne and would have different NMR signals.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an allyl ester, which would have a double bond adjacent to the ester. So, substituent is –O–CO–CH2–CH=CH2. But that has –CH2– groups, which are not present in the NMR. So that's a problem.

Hmm, perhaps I'm approaching this the wrong way. Let me think about the possible structures given the options.

Looking at the options:

C11H12O2 → DoU=6.

C11H14O2 → DoU=5.

C12H12O2 → DoU= (2*12 +2 -12)/2= (26-12)/2=7 → 7 DoU.

C12H14O2 → (24+2-14)/2= (12)/2=6 DoU.

Wait, the benzene ring is 3 DoU. So the substituents must contribute the rest.

For option D: C11H12O2 → DoU=6. So substituents contribute 3 DoU. So perhaps each substituent contributes 1.5 DoU, but that's impossible. So perhaps one substituent contributes 2 DoU and the other 1 DoU. For example, one substituent is an ester (1 DoU) and another is a ring (like a benzene ring, but that's already accounted for). No, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, one substituent is an ester (1 DoU) and another is a vinyl group (1 DoU), giving a total of 2 DoU. Then with the benzene ring (3), the total is 5 DoU, which would match option A (DoU=5). But option D has DoU=6. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a benzene ring itself, but that would complicate the structure.

Wait, perhaps the substituent includes a carbonyl group (ester) and a double bond (vinyl). So each substituent contributes 2 DoU. For example, substituent is an allyl ester: –O–CO–CH2–CH=CH2. But that has –CH2– groups, which are not allowed.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a cyclic ester, but that's a lactone and probably not relevant here.

Wait, maybe I should consider the number of protons. The 1H NMR has six signals: two aromatic, two vinyl, two methyl. So total H is 2 (aromatic) + 2 (vinyl) + 2 (methyl) = 6. But wait, the molecular formulas must have more Hs because the options are C11H12O2 etc.

Wait, no: the NMR signals are for different types of H. So the total number of H in the molecule is the sum of all signals. Let's compute for each option:

Option A: C11H14O2 → 14 H.

Option D: C11H12O2 → 12 H.

The NMR shows six signals, but the actual number of H in the molecule would be higher. Wait, no, the NMR signals are for different types of Hs, each integrating to their respective number of Hs. For example, the aromatic-H signals could each integrate to 2 H, vinyl each to 2 H, and methyl each to 3 H. Wait, but the question says the NMR shows six signals: two for aromatic (each integrating to 2 H), two for vinyl (each 2 H), and two for methyl (each 3 H? Or maybe each 1 H? No, because methyl typically is a singlet, but the integration would sum to 3 H per group if they're separate).

Wait, but the question states: six signals in total. Let me think about how many Hs each part contributes.

If the aromatic ring has two substituents, each substituent affecting the Hs. Suppose the aromatic ring has four Hs (since di-substituted benzene has four Hs), which are split into two signals of 2 H each. The vinyl group has two Hs, split into two signals (maybe 1 H each). The methyl groups contribute two signals, each integrating to 3 H. So total H would be 4 + 2 + 6 = 12 H. That would match option D (C11H12O2) and option C (C12H12O2) because both have 12 H.

Alternatively, perhaps the vinyl group has four Hs, split into two signals (like 2 H each). Then total H would be 4 (aromatic) +4 (vinyl) +6 (methyl) =14. That would match option A (C11H14O2) and option B (C12H14O2).

Wait, but the substituent can't have four Hs if it's a vinyl group. A vinyl group is CH₂=CH–, which has two Hs. But perhaps if the substituent is a longer chain, like CH₂=CH–COO–R, which would have more Hs.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propenyl group (CH₂=CH–CH₂–), which has three Hs. But that would introduce a –CH₂– group, which we don't have.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about the possible structures again.

Another approach: the presence of vinyl-H suggests a double bond. So the substituent must have a double bond. The ester group is O-CO-O, but the substituent could be attached via a double bond.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is an acrylate ester: –O–CO–CH₂–CH₂–CH₂–, but that's an ethyl group attached to the ester. No, that's not a vinyl group. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is –O–CO–CH=CH₂. That would be a vinyl ester substituent.

So the substituent would be –O–CO–CH=CH₂. This substituent would contribute a double bond (DoU=1) and the ester (DoU=1), so total 2 DoU per substituent.

If the benzene ring has two such substituents, each contributing 2 DoU, plus the benzene ring's 3 DoU, the total would be 3 + 2*2 =7 DoU. Looking at the options, option C is C12H12O2, which has DoU=7. So that's a possibility.

So the formula would be C12H12O2 (option C).

But wait, the substituents are –O–CO–CH=CH₂. Each substituent would contribute:

O from the ester, COO, and the vinyl group.

Let me calculate the molecular formula.

Each substituent is –O–CO–CH=CH₂. So, each substituent adds:

O: 2 (from O and COO), but wait, the formula is O2, so perhaps two substituents would contribute 4 O's, but the formula only has O2. Hmm, that can't be right.

Wait, wait, the formula is O2, so the substituents can't contribute more than two O's. So perhaps the substituent is a single ester group.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to outline the structure again.

The molecule is a benzene ring with two substituents. One substituent is an ester group, and the other substituent is a vinyl group. But the vinyl group must be part of the ester substituent.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is an ester with a vinyl group attached. So substituent is –O–CO–R, where R is a vinyl group, like CH₂=CH–.

So substituent would be –O–CO–CH₂–CH₂–. No, that introduces –CH₂– groups which we don't have.

Alternatively, substituent is –O–CO–CH=CH₂. Now, the substituent is –O–CO–CH=CH₂. That would contribute a vinyl group without any –CH₂– groups.

So, substituent: –O–CO–CH=CH₂.

Now, the benzene ring has two substituents: one is –O–CO–CH=CH₂, and the other is a methyl group.

So the structure would be benzene with –O–CO–CH=CH₂ and –CH3.

Now, the molecular formula would be:

Benzene: C6H6.

Each substituent:

–O–CO–CH=CH₂: contributes O2, COO (so O2), and the CH=CH₂ contributes 2 C and 3 H (since it's CH₂=CH–O–CO–). Wait, no, the substituent is –O–CO–CH=CH₂. So the substituent is O–CO–CH=CH2. The R group is CH=CH2, so each substituent adds O2 (from the ester), and the R group contributes 3 C (O-CO-CH=CH2: O, C, O, C, C, H2). Hmm, perhaps I should count the carbons.

Wait, the substituent –O–CO–CH=CH₂ has:

O (from the ester), COO (so two O's), then the CH=CH₂ part contributes two C and two H (each CH2 in the double bond). Wait, no: –O–CO–CH=CH₂ would have the structure O-CO-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between CH and CH2? No, the structure is O-CO-CH₂-CH₂, but that's a single bond. No, perhaps it's O-CO-CH₂-CH₂ with a double bond between the CH₂ groups. Wait, I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, substituent is –O–CO–CH₂–CH₂–, but that's longer and includes CH₂ groups.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is –O–CO–CH₂–CH₂–, but that would have –CH₂– groups, which are not allowed.

Alternatively, substituent is –O–CO–CH₂–CHO (an aldehyde), but that's another functional group and perhaps more complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is –O–CO–CH=CH–R, but without any –CH₂– groups. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a methyl ester (O–CO–Me) and another substituent is a vinyl group. So benzene has –O–CO–Me and –CH₂–CH₂–. But that would have –CH₂– groups.

Wait, but the NMR doesn't show any –CH₂– signals, so that can't be.

This is getting complicated. Let me think about the options again.

Looking at the options:

Option D: C11H12O2 → DoU=6.

Option C: C12H12O2 → DoU=7.

Option B: C12H14O2 → DoU=6.

Option A: C11H14O2 → DoU=5.

Earlier, I thought that with substituents being an ester and a vinyl group, the DoU would be 3 (benzene) + 2 (ester and vinyl) =5, matching option A or D.

But perhaps another way: the substituent is a benzoyl ester. Wait, no, that would add more carbons.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a cyclopropane ring attached to the ester, but that's adding more complexity.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is an allyl ester, but without any –CH₂– groups. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propenoyloxy group: –O–CO–CH₂–CH=CH–.

Wait, but that would have –CH₂– groups, which are not allowed.

Hmm, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl group attached directly to the ester oxygen. So substituent is –O–CO–CH=CH–, but that leaves the substituent as O=C-O-CH=CH2. So, –O–CO–CH=CH₂.

In this case, the substituent is –O–CO–CH=CH₂.

Now, the benzene ring has this substituent and another substituent, say a methyl group.

So the molecular formula would be:

Benzene (6 C, 6 H).

–O–CO–CH=CH₂ substituent:

O: 2 (from O and COO).
C: 3 (COO and CH=CH2).
H: 3 (CH=CH2 has two H, but wait, the structure is O-CO-CH=CH2. So the CH=CH2 group has two H on the CH2 and two H on the CH? No, the structure is O-CO-CH2-CH2, but that's a single bond. Wait, no, the substituent is O-CO-CH=CH2. So, CH=CH2 has a CH2 group at the end, but the structure would be O-CO-CH2-CH2 with a double bond. Wait, no, that can't be right.

Alternatively, the substituent is O-CO-CH₂-CH₂ with a double bond between the two CH₂ groups, making it O-CO-CH₂-CH₂→O-CO-CH₂-CH₂ with a double bond → O-CO-CH₂-CH₂ is not a vinyl group. Hmm, I'm getting stuck.

Perhaps it's better to go back to the options and see which one fits all the clues.

Given the NMR data, the structure must have:

- Two substituents on benzene ring.

- An ester group (from IR).

- Two methyl groups (from two –CH3 signals).

- Two vinyl protons (two signals: one doublet, one doublet of quartets).

Now, the vinyl protons must come from a substituent with a double bond adjacent to an electronegative group, perhaps the ester.

So, substituent: –O–CO–CH₂–CH=CH–R? No, that's introducing –CH₂– groups.

Alternatively, substituent is –O–CO–CH=CH–, which would be a vinyl ester. So, substituent is –O–CO–CH=CH– attached to the ring. But wait, that would require the ring to have a double bond, making it a diene, but the ring is already aromatic (so it's fully conjugated).

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl group attached directly to the ester oxygen. So substituent is –O–CO–CH₂–CH₂–, but that's –CH₂– groups, which we don't have.

Alternatively, substituent is –O–CO–CH₂– with a double bond elsewhere, but that's not clear.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an ester with a vinyl group, but without –CH₂– groups. For example, the substituent is –O–CO–CH₂–CH=CH–, but that's a longer chain with –CH₂– groups.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Let me think of another approach.

The molecular formula will have:

Number of carbons: for example, option D is C11H12O2.

The benzene ring has 6 C. So substituents contribute 5 C (since 6 +5=11). The substituents would be two groups. So each substituent must contribute a certain number of C.

If one substituent is an ester, which is O-CO-O-R, and the other is a methyl group.

Wait, substituent 1: –O–CO–Me (acetyloxy). That's 3 C (O, COO, Me).

Substituent 2: –CH3. That's 1 C.

Total substituent C: 3 +1=4. Benzene is 6, so total C is 10. But the formula is 11, so perhaps there's another C somewhere.

Alternatively, substituent 1 is –O–CO–R, where R is a vinyl group. For example, substituent 1 is –O–CO–CH=CH2, which has 3 C (O, COO, CH=CH2 → 2 C). So substituent 1 is O-CO-CH=CH2: that's 4 C? Wait, O is not a C. So substituent 1 is –O–CO–CH=CH2. So substituent 1's R group is CH=CH2, which is 2 C (CH and CH2). So substituent 1 has 3 C (COO is two C, but O isn't a C). Wait, –O–CO–R is ester, R is CH=CH2 (2 C). So substituent 1 contributes 3 C (O-CO-CH=CH2: O, COO (2 C), CH=CH2 (2 C) → total 3? No, wait: O is part of the ester, so COO is two C, and CH=CH2 is two C. So substituent 1 has 4 C (O-C-O-C-O? No, wait, substituent is –O–CO–R, where R is CH=CH2. So substituent has 3 C (COO has two C, R has one C). Wait, no, R is CH=CH2 which has two C. So substituent 1 has 3 C (COO) plus R's two C → 5 C? No, I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, substituent –O–CO–R: R is CH=CH2 (2 C). So substituent is O-CO-CH=CH2. That's 1 (O) + 2 (CO) + 2 (CH=CH2) = 5 C? No, that's not right because O is not a C. So substituent 1 has 2 (COO) + 2 (CH=CH2) = 4 C. Substituent 2 is –CH3, which is 1 C. So total substituent C:4 +1=5. Benzene:6 → total 11 → which matches option D (C11H12O2).

So substituent 1 is –O–CO–CH=CH2 (4 C), substituent 2 is –CH3 (1 C). So total C=6+4+1=11. O is 2 (from ester). H: benzene has 6 H. Substituent 1: O–CO–CH=CH2 → CH=CH2 has 3 H (each CH has 2 H, but wait, CH=CH2 has two H on each CH2? No: CH=CH2 is CH₂-CH₂ with a double bond, but that's not right. Wait, the structure is O-CO-CH₂-CH₂ with a double bond between CH₂ and CH₂: CH₂=CH₂. So substituent 1 is –O–CO–CH₂–CH₂, but that's a single bond. No, substituent 1 is –O–CO–CH=CH2. So, substituent 1 has:

-O-CO-CH=CH2 → ester group, where R is CH=CH2.

Each substituent 1: –O–CO–CH=CH2 → which has 3 C (COO and CH=CH2's two C). No, wait, COO is two C, and CH=CH2 is two C → substituent 1 is four C.

But wait, I think I'm making a mistake here. Let's count the carbons properly.

The substituent is –O–CO–R, where R is CH=CH2. R is two C (CH2 and CH). So substituent 1 has:

-O-CO-CH=CH2 → 1 (O) + 2 (CO) + 2 (CH=CH2) → 5 C? No, because O isn't a carbon. So substituent 1 has 2 (from CO) + 2 (from CH=CH2) → 4 C.

So substituent 1: 4 C.

Substituent 2: –CH3 → 1 C.

Total substituent C:5.

Benzene:6 → total C=11, which matches option D and A.

Now, the H count:

Benzene:6 H.

Substituent 1: –O–CO–CH=CH2 → the CH=CH2 group has 3 H (each CH has 2 H, but wait, CH=CH2 is CH2=CH–. So the CH2 group has 2 H and the CH has 1 H? No, wait: CH₂=CH₂ has two CH₂ groups, each with 2 H. But in –O–CO–CH=CH2, the structure is O–CO–CH₂–CH₂ with a double bond between the CH₂ groups → O–CO–CH₂–CH₂ with a double bond → O–CO–CH₂–CH₂ is a single bond. Wait, no, the substituent is –O–CO–CH=CH2. So the structure is O–CO–CH=CH2. So the substituent has:

-O-CO-CH=CH2 → the CH=CH2 part has two H on the CH₂ group (the terminal CH₂ has two H), and the CH has one H. So substituent 1 contributes 3 H.

Substituent 2: –CH3 → 3 H.

So total H: benzene (6) + substituent 1 (3) + substituent 2 (3) = 12 H.

Which matches option D: C11H12O2 (12 H).

So the formula would be option D: C11H12O2.

Wait, but let me check the NMR again.

The aromatic Hs would be two signals. With substituents –O–CO–CH=CH2 and –CH3, and if they are para, the aromatic Hs would be two sets of two H each. So NMR shows two aromatic signals, each integrating to 2 H.

Vinyl Hs: the substituent –O–CO–CH=CH2 has two CH groups. The CH=CH2 group would have two H on the CH2 and one H on the CH. Wait, no: the structure is O–CO–CH=CH2 → the CH=CH2 is a double bond between the two CH groups. So the substituent has two vinyl Hs: one on each CH.

Wait, no: the structure is O–CO–CH2–CH2, but that's a single bond. No, the substituent is O–CO–CH=CH2. So the substituent is O–CO–CH₂–CH₂ with a double bond between the CH₂ groups, which would make it O–CO–CH₂–CH₂ with a double bond → O–CO–CH₂–CH₂ is not correct. Alternatively, substituent is O–CO–CH₂–CH₂ with a double bond between the CH₂ and CH₂ → which would be O–CO–CH₂–CH₂ with a double bond → which would be O–CO–CH₂–CH₂, but that's not possible without rearranging.

Alternatively, substituent is O–CO–CH₂–CH₂ with a double bond between the two CH₂ groups, making it O–CO–CH₂–CH₂ → O–CO–CH₂–CH₂ is a single structure, but that doesn't have a double bond. I'm getting stuck again.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is O–CO–CH=CH–R, but I'm not sure.

In any case, the NMR shows two vinyl-H signals. So substituent 1 must have two types of vinyl Hs. For example, one H is adjacent to the ester oxygen, and the other is at the end. So one H is a doublet (coupled with one H) and the other is a quartet (coupled with two Hs), which matches the NMR description.

Putting it all together, the formula is C11H12O2, which is option D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves identifying a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound based on its FTIR and 1H NMR spectra. The FTIR spectrum indicates the presence of an ester group, and the 1H NMR spectrum shows six signals: two aromatic-H signals, two vinyl-H signals (one doublet and one doublet of quartets), and two –CH3 signals, with no –CH2 signals. The goal is to determine the molecular formula of the compound from the given options.

### Key Analysis:

1. **Functional Group Identification**:
   - The FTIR spectrum shows an ester group, which contributes two oxygen atoms (O₂) to the molecular formula.

2. **1H NMR Analysis**:
   - **Aromatic-H signals**: Two signals indicate two distinct sets of aromatic protons. This suggests a di-substituted benzene ring with substituents that create two unique environments for the aromatic protons.
   - **Vinyl-H signals**: Two signals (one doublet and one doublet of quartets) indicate the presence of a vinyl group (C=C) with two distinct protons.
   - **–CH3 signals**: Two signals suggest two different methyl groups in different environments.

3. **Structural Considerations**:
   - The absence of –CH2 signals in the NMR indicates that the molecule does not contain any methylene (-CH₂-) groups.
   - The ester group is likely attached to the aromatic ring, and the other substituent must account for the vinyl protons and the two methyl groups.

4. **Molecular Formula and Degrees of Unsaturation**:
   - The benzene ring contributes 3 degrees of unsaturation (DoU). The ester group contributes 1 DoU, and the vinyl group contributes 1 DoU, for a total of 5 DoU. This matches the molecular formula **C₁₁H₁₄O₂** (DoU = 5).

5. **Option Analysis**:
   - **Option A (C₁₁H₁₂O₂)**: DoU = 6. This is inconsistent with the structure, as the ester and vinyl groups only account for 5 DoU.
   - **Option B (C₁₂H₁₄O₂)**: DoU = 6. This is also inconsistent for the same reason as Option A.
   - **Option C (C₁₂H₁₂O₂)**: DoU = 7. This would require an additional degree of unsaturation, which is not supported by the given data.
   - **Option D (C₁₁H₁₄O₂)**: DoU = 5. This matches the expected degrees of unsaturation and aligns with the NMR and IR data.

### Conclusion:
The molecular formula that satisfies all the given data is **C₁₁H₁₄O₂**.
