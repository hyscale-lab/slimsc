Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says we have ten thousand identical systems, each with a particle in a tube along the x-axis. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Wait, but the wave function usually has to be normalized, right? Because the total probability of finding the particle somewhere must be 1.

So the setup is that when they measured the positions, all the particles were found between x=1 and x=3. That means the wave function must be zero outside this interval. But wait, the given wave function is (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Hmm, but that's a complex function. Oh, but in quantum mechanics, the wave function usually includes both real and imaginary parts, but when considering probability, we look at the square of the absolute value, which would be the modulus squared.

Wait, but if the wave function isn't zero outside 1 to 3, that could be a problem. Or perhaps the given wave function is only valid between x=1 and x=3. Oh, because the question says each particle can exist in a part of space where it can be found, so maybe the wave function is zero outside this region. But the given expression is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So maybe this is the only part where the wave function is non-zero, between 1 and 3.

Wait, but how does this function behave at x=1 and x=3? Let me check. At x=1: denominator is sqrt(2), so a/sqrt(2) - 0.5i. At x=3: denominator is sqrt(4)=2, so a/2 -0.5i. Hmm, but I'm not sure if these points are included or not. The particles are found in 1 <= x <=3, so the wave function is non-zero in that interval and zero outside. But the given wave function expression doesn't explicitly show that. Oh, perhaps the expression given is valid only between 1 and 3, and zero elsewhere. But the problem says the wave function is described as that in the part where the particle exists, which is between 1 and 3. So the wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i for 1 ≤ x ≤3, and zero otherwise.

But wait, the wave function must be continuous, right? Or maybe not necessarily, because the potential could be infinite outside, making the wavefunction zero. So perhaps the expression is valid only in the region where the particle exists, and zero outside. But for normalization, I need to integrate the square of the modulus over the region where it's non-zero.

The modulus squared is |ψ(x)|² = (a²/(1+x)) + (0.25) because the real part is a/sqrt(1+x) and the imaginary part is -0.5. So when I square each part and add, (a²/(1+x)) + (0.25). Wait, no, wait. The modulus squared is (Re(ψ))² + (Im(ψ))². So for ψ = A - i B, the modulus squared is A² + B². So in this case, Re(ψ) is a/sqrt(1+x) and Im(ψ) is -0.5. So modulus squared is (a²/(1+x)) + (0.5)^2. So that's (a²/(1+x)) + 0.25.

But wait, the particle is only found between x=1 and x=3, so the integral of |ψ|² dx from 1 to 3 must equal 1.

So the integral from x=1 to x=3 of [ (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx = 1.

Wait, but wait a minute. If the wave function is zero outside of 1 to 3, then the integral over all space would be 1. So integrating from 1 to 3 is correct.

Let me set up the integral:

∫₁³ [ (a²/(1+x)) + 0.25 ] dx = 1

But wait, solving this integral might help us find 'a'.

Let me compute this integral.

Breaking it into two terms:

Integral [a²/(1+x) dx] from 1 to 3 + Integral [0.25 dx] from 1 to 3 = 1.

The first integral: ∫ a²/(1+x) dx from 1 to3. Let me compute that.

The integral of 1/(1+x) dx is ln(1+x) + C. So the first integral becomes a² [ln(4) - ln(2)] = a² ln(2).

Because ln(3+1)=ln(4) and ln(1+1)=ln(2).

The second integral is 0.25*(3-1) = 0.25*(2) = 0.5.

So putting it all together:

a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1

Because the sum of the two integrals is equal to 1.

So solving for a²:

a² ln(2) = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5.

So a² = 0.5 / ln(2)

Compute ln(2):

Approximately, ln(2) is about 0.6931.

So a² = 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

So a ≈ sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849, which is approximately 0.85. Looking at the options, option B is 0.85.

Wait, but let me double-check my steps.

Wait, the integral of (a²)/(1+x) from 1 to 3: yes, that's correct. And the second part is 0.25*(2) = 0.5. So the equation is a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1. That gives a² ln(2) = 0.5. So a² = 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213. a ≈ sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849, which is approximately 0.85.

So the correct answer should be option B.

Wait, but let me think again. Oh wait, the wave function is given as (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So the modulus squared would be (a²/(1+x)) + (0.5)^2 = a²/(1+x) + 0.25.

Wait, no, wait. The imaginary part is -0.5i, so the imaginary part is Im(ψ) = -0.5, so its square is (-0.5)^2 = 0.25. So the modulus squared is (a²/(1+x)) + 0.25.

So the integral setup is correct. So the calculation for a would be as above. So a is around 0.85, which is option B.

To determine the value of \( a \), we start by noting that the wave function is given as:

\[
\psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i
\]

The modulus squared of the wave function is:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (-0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25
\]

Since the particle is only found between \( x = 1 \) and \( x = 3 \), the normalization condition requires:

\[
\int_1^3 |\psi(x)|^2 dx = 1
\]

Substituting \( |\psi(x)|^2 \), the integral becomes:

\[
\int_1^3 \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1
\]

This can be split into two separate integrals:

\[
\int_1^3 \frac{a^2}{1+x} dx + \int_1^3 0.25 dx = 1
\]

### First Integral:
\[
\int_1^3 \frac{a^2}{1+x} dx = a^2 \int_1^3 \frac{1}{1+x} dx
\]

The integral of \( \frac{1}{1+x} \) is \( \ln(1+x) \), so:

\[
a^2 \left[\ln(4) - \ln(2)\right] = a^2 \ln(2)
\]

### Second Integral:
\[
\int_1^3 0.25 dx = 0.25 \cdot (3 - 1) = 0.5
\]

### Combining Results:
Adding the two integrals:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1
\]

Solving for \( a^2 \):

\[
a^2 \ln(2) = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5
\]

\[
a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}
\]

Using \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \):

\[
a^2 = \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7213
\]

\[
a \approx \sqrt{0.7213} \approx 0.85
\]

Thus, the value of \( a \) is approximately \( 0.85 \), which corresponds to **Option B**.
