Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem is about finding the uncertainty in the P_z operator, ΔP_z. I remember that the uncertainty is calculated using the formula ΔP_z = sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²). So I need to find the expectation values of P_z and P_z squared.

First, I need to understand the setup. The system is in an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ. The given state is a column vector: (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z, which probably means that the state is expressed in the eigenbasis of P_z.

Wait, P_z is given as a diagonal matrix:
P_z = diag(ħ, 0, -ħ). So its eigenvalues are ħ, 0, -ħ. The basis vectors are |+z>, |0>, and |-z>, right? Since the state is given in this basis.

So the state |ψ> is the column vector (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). Let me verify if this is a normalized vector. Let's compute the sum of squares:

(-1/2)^2 + (1/√2)^2 + (-1/2)^2 = (1/4) + (1/2) + (1/4) = (1/4 + 1/4) is 1/2, plus 1/2 gives 1. So it's normalized. Good.

Now, I need to compute ⟨P_z⟩ and ⟨P_z²⟩.

Wait, but P_z is diagonal, so calculating the expectation values should be straightforward because in the basis of P_z, the matrix is diagonal. So ⟨P_z⟩ is just the sum of each component multiplied by their probabilities.

But wait, the state is given as |ψ> = [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ]^T. So the components are ψ_1 = -1/2, ψ_2 = 1/√2, ψ_3 = -1/2.

Since the basis is the eigenstate of P_z, each component corresponds to the eigenvalue of P_z. So ψ_1 is the amplitude for the eigenstate with eigenvalue ħ, ψ_2 is the amplitude for the eigenstate with eigenvalue 0, and ψ_3 is for eigenvalue -ħ.

So the expectation value ⟨P_z⟩ is ψ_1* * ħ + ψ_2* * 0 + ψ_3* * (-ħ). But since ψ_1 and ψ_3 are real, their complex conjugates are the same. So:

⟨P_z⟩ = ( (-1/2)^2 ) * ħ + ( (1/√2)^2 ) * 0 + ( (-1/2)^2 ) * (-ħ)

Wait, no. Wait, no. Wait a second. The expectation value is sum |ψ_i|^2 * eigenvalue. Because |ψ_i|^2 is the probability of being in that eigenstate, and eigenvalue is the corresponding value.

So |ψ_1|^2 is (1/2), |ψ_2|^2 is (1/2), |ψ_3|^2 is (1/2) as well? Wait, wait, let me calculate each |ψ_i|^2.

|ψ_1|^2 = (-1/2)^2 = 1/4.

|ψ_2|^2 = (1/√2)^2 = 1/2.

|ψ_3|^2 = (-1/2)^2 = 1/4.

So the probabilities are 25%, 50%, 25%.

So ⟨P_z⟩ = (1/4)*ħ + (1/2)*0 + (1/4)*(-ħ) = (1/4 - 1/4 ) ħ + 0 = 0.

Wait, that simplifies to zero. So ⟨P_z⟩ is zero. That makes sense because the state is a superposition of eigenstates with +ħ, 0, and -ħ, and the probabilities for +ħ and -ħ are equal, so they cancel each other out. So the average is zero.

Now, for ⟨P_z²⟩, since P_z squared would be (ħ)^2, 0^2, (-ħ)^2, so each is (ħ², 0, ħ²). So the expectation value would be |ψ_1|^2 * ħ² + |ψ_2|^2 * 0 + |ψ_3|^2 * ħ².

Which is (1/4)ħ² + (1/2)*0 + (1/4)ħ² = (1/4 + 1/4) ħ² = (1/2) ħ².

So ⟨P_z²⟩ = (1/2) ħ².

Now, the uncertainty ΔP_z is sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩² ). Since ⟨P_z⟩ is zero, this becomes sqrt( (1/2) ħ² ) = sqrt(1/2) * ħ = ħ / sqrt(2).

So the uncertainty is ħ over root 2.

Looking at the options, option B is ħ/√2. So I think that's the answer.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

Wait, another way to compute ⟨P_z²⟩ is to compute the expectation value using the matrix. But since P_z is diagonal, it's easier as I did.

Alternatively, if I had to compute using the matrix, I'd have to multiply the state vector by the matrix and then take the inner product.

But since the state is given in the eigenbasis of P_z, the calculation is straightforward.

Another way: The state is |ψ> = a |+z> + b |0> + c |-z>, where a = -1/2, b=1/√2, c=-1/2.

Then, P_z |+z> = ħ |+z>, P_z |0> = 0, P_z |-z> = -ħ |-z>.

So ⟨P_z⟩ = |a|² * ħ + |b|² * 0 + |c|² * (-ħ) = (1/4)*ħ + (1/2)*0 + (1/4)*(-ħ) = 0. Correct.

⟨P_z²⟩ = |a|² * ħ² + |b|² * 0 + |c|² * ħ² = (1/4 + 1/4) ħ² = (1/2) ħ².

So yes, same result.

Thus, ΔP_z = sqrt( (1/2) ħ² ) = ħ / sqrt(2), which is option B.

To calculate the uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ of the operator $P_z$, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

The given state of the system is the column vector:

\[
|\psi\rangle = \begin{pmatrix} -\frac{1}{2} \\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ -\frac{1}{2} \end{pmatrix}.
\]

This state is expressed in the eigenbasis of $P_z$, where $P_z$ is diagonal with eigenvalues $\hbar$, $0$, and $-\hbar$. The probabilities of the system being in the eigenstates of $P_z$ are given by the squared magnitudes of the components of $|\psi\rangle$:

\[
|-\frac{1}{2}|^2 = \frac{1}{4}, \quad |\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}|^2 = \frac{1}{2}, \quad |-\frac{1}{2}|^2 = \frac{1}{4}.
\]

### Step 1: Compute $\langle P_z \rangle$
The expectation value $\langle P_z \rangle$ is the weighted average of the eigenvalues of $P_z$, with the weights being the probabilities:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \left(\frac{1}{4}\right)(\hbar) + \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)(0) + \left(\frac{1}{4}\right)(-\hbar).
\]

Simplifying:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \frac{1}{4}\hbar - \frac{1}{4}\hbar = 0.
\]

### Step 2: Compute $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$
The eigenvalues of $P_z^2$ are the squares of the eigenvalues of $P_z$, which are $\hbar^2$, $0$, and $\hbar^2$. The expectation value $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$ is similarly computed:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \left(\frac{1}{4}\right)(\hbar^2) + \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)(0) + \left(\frac{1}{4}\right)(\hbar^2).
\]

Simplifying:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{1}{4}\hbar^2 + \frac{1}{4}\hbar^2 = \frac{1}{2}\hbar^2.
\]

### Step 3: Compute $\Delta P_z$
Using the formula for uncertainty:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}\hbar^2 - 0^2} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}\hbar^2} = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

### Final Answer
The uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ is $\frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}$, which corresponds to option **B**.
