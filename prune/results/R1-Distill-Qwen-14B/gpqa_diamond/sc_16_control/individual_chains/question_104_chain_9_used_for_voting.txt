Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Let me try to unpack it step by step. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll think it through.

Alright, the setup: two stars with the same mass as the Sun. Each has a planet, both similar to Neptune in mass. The planets are in circular orbits. So the main differences are the shifts in their spectral lines detected via RV method.

Wait, the RV method measures the Doppler shift of the star's spectrum due to the planet's gravity. The bigger the shift, the more massive the planet or the closer it is, right? So the shift is related to the velocity of the star in its orbit around the barycenter.

The question gives the shifts: Planet #1 causes a 5 milliangstrom shift, and Planet #2's star has a 7 milliangstrom shift. They're asking how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1.

Hmm, I remember that the RV method relates the velocity semi-amplitude K to the mass of the planet and the orbital period. But wait, the formula for K involves the mass of the planet, the mass of the star, and the orbital period and semi-major axis. Oh right, because the star's velocity is related to the planet's orbit.

The formula I think is K = (v) = (2πG)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) ) ) * (1/ (1 AU)^(1/3)) ). Wait, maybe I should recall the exact formula.

Alternatively, the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p) * (1 - e²)^(0.5) ) ) ]^(1/3) ) * ( sin i ) / (P)^(1/3) )

Wait, but in the case where M_p is much smaller than M_star (which is the case here, since Neptune is much less massive than the Sun), M_p << M_star, so M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. So the formula simplifies.

So K ≈ ( (G * M_p ) / (M_star) )^(1/3) ) * ( sin i ) / (P^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(0.5) )

But since the orbits are circular (e=0), the denominator's sqrt(1-e²) becomes 1. Also, assuming i=90 degrees, which makes sin i =1, so the formula becomes:

K ≈ ( (G * M_p ) / (M_star) )^(1/3) ) / (P^(1/3) )

But wait, I'm not sure about the exact exponents. Let me think again. Another approach is to remember that the velocity semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_p / M_star) * (P)^(-1/3) ), perhaps. Because when the period is longer, the star moves slower, so K is smaller.

Wait, no, because velocity is inversely related to period. Because if the planet is farther away (longer period), the star's velocity would be lower. So for the same mass planet, a longer period would mean a smaller K. So if planet #2 has a larger K, that would imply a shorter period.

Wait, but in the question, planet #1's shift is 5, and planet #2 is 7. So K2 is larger than K1. So K2 = 7/5 * K1. So K2 = 1.4 * K1.

But wait, if K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), then:

K ∝ (M_p) / (M_star) * (1 / P^(1/3) )

Wait, but in this question, M_p for both planets is the same (both similar to Neptune), and M_star is same for both. So K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3).

So K1 = (some constant) / P1^(1/3)
K2 = (same constant) / P2^(1/3)

So the ratio K2/K1 is (P1 / P2 )^(1/3 )

Because K2/K1 = (constant / P2^(1/3)) ) / (constant / P1^(1/3)) ) = (P1/P2)^(1/3 )

Wait, no:

Wait, K2/K1 = (1/P2^(1/3)) / (1/P1^(1/3)) ) = (P1/P2)^(1/3 )

So K2 = K1 * (P1/P2)^(1/3 )

But from the given data, K2 is 7 and K1 is 5. So 7/5 = (P1/P2)^(1/3 )

Wait, wait, no: K2 is 7, K1 is 5.

So 7/5 = (P1 / P2 )^(1/3 )

So (7/5)^3 = P1/P2

So 343/125 = P1/P2

Which implies that P2 = P1 * (125/343 )

Wait, because P1/P2 = 343/125 → P2 = P1 * (125/343 )

Hmm, 125 is 5^3, 343 is 7^3. So 125/343 is (5/7)^3.

So P2 = P1 * (5/7)^3.

Wait, that's not possible because if K is larger, the period is shorter. Because K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So when K increases, P must decrease. So if K2 is larger than K1, P2 is smaller than P1. But the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1? So if P2 is shorter, that ratio would be less than one.

Wait, but in the previous calculation, I'm getting P2 = P1 * (5/7)^3 = P1 * 125/343 ≈ 0.364 times P1. So P2 is about 0.364 times P1. Which would mean P2 is shorter than P1. So how many times longer is P2 than P1? It's 0.364 times, meaning it's shorter. So the question is, how much longer is P2 than P1? It's not; it's shorter. So that would suggest the ratio is 0.36 times, which is option A.

But wait, the question asks how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is than planet #1. So if P2 is 0.36 * P1, it's 36% of P1, so P2 is 0.36 times P1. So the period is shorter, only 0.36 times as long. So the ratio P2/P1 is 0.36.

Wait, but wait a minute, let me double-check the math.

We have K2/K1 = (P1/P2)^(1/3 )

So (7/5) = (P1/P2)^(1/3 )

Raise both sides to the power of 3:

343/125 = P1/P2

Which rearranges to P2 = (125/343) * P1

So P2 = (5^3)/(7^3) * P1 ≈ (125/343) * P1 ≈ 0.364 * P1.

So P2 is about 0.364 times P1. So the orbital period of planet #2 is shorter than that of planet #1. Therefore, the question is asking how many times longer is P2 than P1. So it's not longer, it's shorter, so the ratio P2/P1 is 0.364, which is approximately 0.36 times. So the answer is option A.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't mix up the ratio. The question is: How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1? So if P2 is 0.364 * P1, that means it's shorter. So the period is shorter, so P2 is 0.36 times as long as P1. So the correct ratio is 0.36 times, so the answer is option A.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me think again about the formula.

The formula for K (radial velocity semi-amplitude) is:

K = (v * sin i) = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p) ) )^(1/3) * (1/(2π)) ) * (1/(P^(1/3)) )

Wait, perhaps I should think of the formula in terms of the ratio.

Since the two stars have the same mass and the two planets have the same mass, the only variable is the orbital period and the semi-major axis (which is related to the period via Kepler's third law).

So, the RV method gives K proportional to (M_p / M_star) * (1 / P^(1/3) )

Wait, no, actually, the exact formula is:

K = ( (G * M_p * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p) ) )^(1/3) * (1 / (P * (1 - e^2)^(1/2)) ) )^(1/3 )

Wait, maybe I should use Kepler's third law to relate P and a.

Kepler's third law in the form: P^2 = (4π² G M_star )^(-1) * a^3.

But perhaps another approach is to relate the RV semi-amplitude K to the orbital period. The formula I think is:

K = ( (27.4 m/s ) * (M_p sin i) / (M_jup) ) / ( (M_star + M_p) / M_sun )^(1/3) ) * (P / yr )^(-1/3) )

Wait, wait, let's get the exact formula. The radial velocity semi-amplitude is given by:

K = [ (G * M_p ) / ( (M_star + M_p) ) ) ]^(1/3) * (1 / (2π)) ) * (1 / (P^(1/3)) )

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to write the proportionality. Since M_p and M_star are the same for both planets, K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3).

So K is proportional to 1 / P^(1/3). So K1/K2 = P2^(1/3) / P1^(1/3 )

Wait, because K ∝ 1/P^(1/3), so K2/K1 = (P1/P2)^(1/3 )

Wait, that's what I had before. So yes, that's correct.

So given K2 = 7, K1 =5.

So 7/5 = (P1/P2)^(1/3 )

Raise both sides to the 3rd power: (7/5)^3 = P1/P2 → 343/125 = P1/P2 → P2 = (125/343) * P1 ≈ 0.364 * P1.

So P2 is about 0.36 times P1. So the period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1, which means it is shorter. So the answer is 0.36 times longer, which is option A.

To determine how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1, we analyze the relationship between the radial velocity semi-amplitude \( K \) and the orbital period \( P \). The radial velocity method measures the Doppler shift of the star's spectral lines, and \( K \) is inversely proportional to \( P^{1/3} \) when the planet-to-star mass ratio and the orbital eccentricity are constant. 

Given:
- \( K_1 = 5 \, \text{milliangstrom} \) (planet #1),
- \( K_2 = 7 \, \text{milliangstrom} \) (planet #2),

the ratio of the semi-amplitudes is:

\[
\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \frac{7}{5}.
\]

From the proportionality \( K \propto P^{-1/3} \), we have:

\[
\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \left(\frac{P_1}{P_2}\right)^{1/3}.
\]

Rearranging, we solve for the ratio of periods:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{K_1}{K_2}\right)^3 = \left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3 = \frac{125}{343}.
\]

Calculating this:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} \approx 0.364.
\]

Thus, the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times the orbital period of planet #1. Therefore, the orbital period of planet #2 is **shorter** than that of planet #1 by a factor of approximately 0.36.
