Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it. The question is about finding the normalized eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. 

Hmm, wait a second. Oh right, the operator P is given in terms of its components P_x, P_y, and P_z. Each of these is a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2. I remember that in quantum mechanics, the total angular momentum operator is often represented as a vector operator, and the components are matrices. So the operator P would be the sum of these components multiplied by the direction vector n. But wait, the direction is arbitrary in the x-z plane. Oh, right, the direction vector n can be expressed in terms of spherical coordinates. So n would be (sinθ cosφ, sinθ sinφ, cosθ), but since it's in the x-z plane, φ is zero. So n is (sinθ, 0, cosθ). 

Wait, no. Wait, the x-z plane is where y=0, so the direction vector would have components (sinθ, 0, cosθ). So any direction in the x-z plane can be parameterized by θ, where θ is the polar angle from the z-axis. 

Therefore, the operator P along direction n would be P = n · (P_x, P_y, P_z). So that's P = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z. Since n is in the x-z plane, n_y = 0. So P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z. 

Wait, but n has to be a unit vector, so n_x² + n_z² = 1. Since n_y is zero, yeah. So n_x is sinθ, and n_z is cosθ. 

So the operator P along n is (sinθ P_x + cosθ P_z) multiplied by ħ/2. Because each component is (ħ/2) times their respective matrices. Let me write that out. 

First, let's compute each component matrix:

P_x is (ħ/2) times [ [0, 1], [1, 0] ].
P_y is (ħ/2) times [ [0, -i], [i, 0] ].
P_z is (ħ/2) times [ [1, 0], [0, -1] ].

So when we construct P along n, which is (sinθ * P_x) + (cosθ * P_z), each multiplied by ħ/2. Wait, actually, no. Because each component is already (ħ/2) multiplied by their matrices. So when we take n_x P_x, it's (sinθ) * (ħ/2) * P_x_matrix, same for P_z. So overall, P along n is (ħ/2) [ sinθ P_x_matrix + cosθ P_z_matrix ].

So the matrix of P along n is (ħ/2) times [ [ cosθ, sinθ ], [sinθ, -cosθ ] ].

Wait, let me compute that. The P_x matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], and P_z is [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So sinθ * P_x matrix is [[0, sinθ], [sinθ, 0]], and cosθ * P_z matrix is [[cosθ,0], [0, -cosθ]]. Adding them together gives:

[ [cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ] ].

So the operator P along n is (ħ/2) multiplied by this matrix. 

Now, we need to find the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. So the eigenvalue equation is P |v> = (+ħ/2) |v>.

Substituting P, we have (ħ/2) [ [cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ] ] |v> = (ħ/2) |v>.

Dividing both sides by (ħ/2), we get the matrix equation:

[ [cosθ, sinθ],
  [sinθ, -cosθ] ] |v> = |v>.

So the matrix equation is (M - I) |v> = 0, where M is the matrix and I is identity. Wait, no, wait. The eigenvalue equation after substitution is M |v> = (I) |v>, since (M)|v> = |v> because the right-hand side is (1) times |v> (since (ħ/2) |v> on both sides). So, the matrix M is [[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ]], and the equation is M |v> = |v>.

Thus, (M - I) |v> = 0. So the matrix (M - I) is:

[ cosθ - 1, sinθ ]
[ sinθ, -cosθ -1 ]

We can write this as:

[ cosθ - 1, sinθ ]
[ sinθ, - (cosθ +1) ]

To find the eigenvectors, we need to solve for the non-trivial solutions of this equation. The determinant of (M - I) must be zero for non-trivial solutions.

Wait, no. Wait, no, actually, for the equation (M - I)|v>=0, the determinant of (M - I) must be zero for non-trivial solutions. So let's compute the determinant.

Determinant D = (cosθ -1)(-cosθ -1) - (sinθ)(sinθ).

Expanding that: 

= (-cosθ (cosθ -1) -1 (cosθ -1)) - sin²θ

Wait, let me compute it step by step.

First, (cosθ -1)(-cosθ -1) = (cosθ -1)(- (cosθ +1)) )= - (cosθ -1)(cosθ +1) )= - [ (cosθ)^2 -1^2 ] = - ( cos²θ -1 ) = -( - sin²θ ) = sin²θ.

Then, the term from the sinθ * sinθ is (sinθ)^2, but since it's subtracted in the determinant, it's - (sinθ)^2.

Wait, let me recompute:

D = (cosθ -1)(-cosθ -1) - (sinθ)(sinθ)

Expanding the first product:

= (cosθ)(-cosθ) + (cosθ)(-1) -1*(-cosθ) -1*(-1)
= -cos²θ - cosθ + cosθ + 1
= -cos²θ + 1

So then D = ( -cos²θ +1 ) - sin²θ.

Wait, because (sinθ)^2 is subtracted, so D = (-cos²θ + 1) - sin²θ.

But wait, wait, 1 - cos²θ is sin²θ. So D = sin²θ - sin²θ = 0.

So determinant is zero, which makes sense because we are looking for eigenvalues, and the equation is setup for that.

Now, to find the eigenvector, we can use the first row to set up the equation.

From (M - I) |v> = 0,

The first component is (cosθ -1) v1 + sinθ v2 = 0.

So (cosθ -1) v1 + sinθ v2 = 0.

We can write this as (1 - cosθ) v1 = sinθ v2.

So v2 = ( (1 - cosθ)/sinθ ) v1.

But (1 - cosθ)/sinθ is equal to tan(θ/2). Because using the identities:

1 - cosθ = 2 sin²(θ/2),
sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2).

So (1 - cosθ)/sinθ = (2 sin²(θ/2)) / (2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2)) ) = (sin(θ/2) ) / (cos(θ/2)) ) = tan(θ/2).

So v2 = tan(θ/2) v1.

So the eigenvector components are proportional to v1 and v2 = tan(θ/2) v1.

Let me write this as |v> = v1 [1; tan(θ/2)].

We can choose v1 to be a normalization factor. Let's set v1 = 1 for simplicity, then normalize later.

But for the purpose of finding the normalized eigenvector, let's compute the normalization. The vector is [1, tan(θ/2)].

The magnitude squared is 1^2 + [tan(θ/2)]^2 = 1 + tan²(θ/2) = sec²(θ/2) = 1 / cos²(θ/2).

So the normalization factor is sqrt( cos²(θ/2) ) = cos(θ/2).

Thus, the normalized eigenvector is |v> = cos(θ/2) [1; tan(θ/2)].

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the components would be [1, tan(theta/2)] multiplied by the normalization factor sqrt(...), which is 1/sqrt(1 + tan^2(theta/2)) ) = cos(theta/2).

So |v> is:

v1 = cos(theta/2),
v2 = sin(theta/2).

Wait, because tan(theta/2) = sin(theta/2)/cos(theta/2), so when you multiply [1, tan(theta/2)] by cos(theta/2), you get [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Wait, let's see: [1, tan(theta/2)] multiplied by cos(theta/2) is [cos(theta/2), tan(theta/2) * cos(theta/2)].

But tan(theta/2) is sin(theta/2)/cos(theta/2), so multiplying by cos(theta/2) gives sin(theta/2).

So the normalized eigenvector is [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)].

Wait, but considering the original setup, the eigenvalue was +ħ/2. So perhaps the components are scaled by some factors. But looking at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), but without the ħ factor. 

Looking at the options:

Option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which matches our result. So that's one possibility. But let me check the other options.

Wait, the problem asks for the elements of the normalized eigenvector. So the eigenvector is a vector with components in terms of theta, without any ħ factors, because it's a normalized vector. So the eigenvector is [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)].

So looking at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2)). Hmm, but in our case, the components are real, right? Because the operator P along n is Hermitian, so its eigenvectors should be real or have real coefficients. 

Wait, wait, no. Because the components P_x, P_y, P_z are Hermitian operators. So the operator P along n, which is a linear combination of Hermitian operators, is also Hermitian, as long as the coefficients (n_x, n_y, n_z) are real. Since n is a unit vector, n_x and n_z are real, so yes, P is Hermitian. Therefore, its eigenvectors should be real.

So the eigenvector components should be real numbers. Therefore, any complex components would come from the eigenstates, but perhaps in this specific case, the eigenvector is real.

Wait, in our case, the components are [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)]. So option C is (cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2)), which has a complex component unless phi is zero or something. But in our case, the components are real, so phi is zero. Therefore, option C could be correct.

Wait, but another thought: in the initial problem statement, are the components of the operator P_x, P_y, etc., already multiplied by ħ/2, or is the operator P_x equal to (ħ/2) times that matrix? Let me check.

Yes, the question states that P_x is (ħ/2) times the matrix [0 1; 1 0], and same for the others. So when we compute the operator P along n, it's (n_x * ħ/2 * P_x_matrix) + (n_z * ħ/2 * P_z_matrix). So the operator P is (ħ/2) times [n_x P_x_matrix + n_z P_z_matrix]. So when we found the eigenvector, we had to solve for (M - I)|v> = 0, leading to the components [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)].

Wait, but the question is about the normalized eigenvector of the operator P. So perhaps the components are scaled by some factors, but since the eigenvector is normalized, the components are just the cosine and sine terms, without ħ.

Looking at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), so that's looking correct.

But looking at the other options:

Option B: (cos theta, e^{i phi} sin theta). That looks like a spherical harmonic, but for l=1, m=0 or something. But I don't think that's the case here.

Option D: (sqrt(2/3) ħ cos(theta/2), sqrt(1/3) ħ sin(theta/2)). The presence of ħ is confusing, because eigenvectors are dimensionless. So that can't be right. Because operators have units, but eigenvectors are abstract vectors, so their components are dimensionless. Hence, ħ shouldn't be present. So options A and D have factors with ħ, which I think is incorrect.

Option A: (sqrt(2/3) ħ, sqrt(1/3) ħ). Again, the presence of ħ is a red flag, because eigenvectors are normalized, so their components shouldn't have units of ħ.

Therefore, the only plausible options are B and C.

Wait, but earlier I thought the components are [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)], which matches option C. But wait, why isn't it [ sin(theta/2), cos(theta/2) ]? No, because from the equations, we have v2 = tan(theta/2) v1, which when normalized becomes [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)].

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup. Let me re-examine.

Wait, the operator P along n is (ħ/2) times [ [ cosθ, sinθ ], [sinθ, -cosθ] ].

The eigenvalue equation is (P along n) |v> = (ħ/2) |v>.

So the matrix equation is [ [cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ] ] |v> = |v>.

Which leads to the matrix [ [cosθ -1, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ -1] ] times |v> equals zero.

From which we found v2 = tan(theta/2) v1. So the eigenvector is [1, tan(theta/2)] up to normalization.

Which gives us the normalized vector [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

So that's option C.

Wait, but wait a moment. What about the global phase? In quantum mechanics, the global phase doesn't matter, but the question is about the normalized eigenvector. So the components are as in option C.

So the correct answer should be option C.

To solve the problem, we need to find the normalized eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator $\vec{P}$ along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The operator $\vec{P}$ is given in terms of its components $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$, which are 2x2 matrices multiplied by $\hbar/2$. The direction $\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane, so it can be parameterized as $\vec{n} = (\sin\theta, 0, \cos\theta)$, where $\theta$ is the polar angle from the z-axis.

### Step 1: Construct the operator $\vec{P}$ along $\vec{n}$
The operator $\vec{P}$ along $\vec{n}$ is given by:
\[
\vec{P} = \vec{n} \cdot (\vec{P}_x, \vec{P}_y, \vec{P}_z),
\]
where $\vec{P}_x = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}, \, \vec{P}_y = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{bmatrix}, \, \vec{P}_z = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix}$. Since $\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane, $\vec{n}_y = 0$, so:
\[
\vec{P} = \vec{n}_x P_x + \vec{n}_z P_z = \frac{\hbar}{2} \left( \sin\theta \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix} + \cos\theta \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix} \right).
\]
Simplifying, the matrix representation of $\vec{P}$ is:
\[
\vec{P} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 2: Solve the eigenvalue equation
The eigenvalue equation is:
\[
\vec{P} |v\rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} |v\rangle.
\]
Substituting $\vec{P}$, we have:
\[
\begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} v_1 \\ v_2 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} v_1 \\ v_2 \end{bmatrix}.
\]
This leads to the system of equations:
\[
(\cos\theta - 1)v_1 + \sin\theta v_2 = 0, \quad \sin\theta v_1 - (\cos\theta + 1)v_2 = 0.
\]
From the first equation:
\[
v_2 = \frac{\sin\theta}{1 - \cos\theta} v_1 = \tan\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) v_1.
\]
Thus, the eigenvector components are proportional to $v_1$ and $v_2 = \tan\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) v_1$.

### Step 3: Normalize the eigenvector
The eigenvector can be written as:
\[
|v\rangle = v_1 \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ \tan\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \end{bmatrix}.
\]
To normalize, we compute the magnitude:
\[
\| |v\rangle \|^2 = v_1^2 \left(1 + \tan^2\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)\right) = v_1^2 \sec^2\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right).
\]
Thus, $v_1 = \cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)$, and the normalized eigenvector is:
\[
|v\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} \cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \\ \sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 4: Analyze the options
- **Option A**: $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar, \sqrt{1/3}\hbar)$: This includes $\hbar$, which is incorrect because eigenvectors are dimensionless.
- **Option B**: $(\cos\theta, e^{i\phi}\sin\theta)$: This represents a spherical harmonic but does not match the derived eigenvector.
- **Option C**: $(\cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2))$: This matches the derived normalized eigenvector.
- **Option D**: $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar \cos(\theta/2), \sqrt{1/3}\hbar \sin(\theta/2))$: This includes $\hbar$, which is incorrect.

The correct answer is **Option C**, as it matches the normalized eigenvector derived from the eigenvalue equation.
