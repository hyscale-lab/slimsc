Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem says that astronomers are observing a star similar to the Sun. One hemisphere has dark spots covering 20% of its area. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. Because only one hemisphere is spotty, when the star rotates, the brightness changes, making it look like there's an exoplanet causing the variation. 

The question is asking, if we didn't have these spots, what would be the radius of an exoplanet needed to create the same brightness variation as the spots do. So, we're comparing the effect of the planet blocking some light to the effect of the spots.

Hmm. I remember that the change in brightness when a planet transits a star is called the transit method for exoplanet detection. The formula for the change in brightness (the depth of the transit) is (Rp / Rstar)^2, where Rp is the planet's radius and Rstar is the star's radius. So the amplitude of the variation is proportional to (Rp/Rstar)^2.

But wait, in this case, the star isn't being blocked by a planet. Instead, it's the spots causing the variation. So I need to figure out what the equivalent change in brightness due to the spots would be, and then find the planet radius that would cause the same change.

Let me think about the spots. The filling factor is 20%, which I believe is the fraction of the hemisphere that's covered by spots. But wait, the star is a sphere, so when we talk about a hemisphere being covered, it's half the star's surface. So the total area of the spots would be 0.2 * (π Rstar²) * (1/2) because only one hemisphere is spotty? Or maybe the filling factor is the fraction of the entire star's surface covered. Wait, the question says the star's hemisphere is covered with a filling factor of 20%, so I think that means 20% of that hemisphere's area is spots. So total spot area is 0.2 * (0.5 * 4π R²) )? Wait, no, maybe I'm complicating it. The filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere that is spots. So for one hemisphere, the spot area is 0.2 * (hemisphere area). Hemisphere area is 2π R², so spot area is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R².

Wait, but the star is a sphere, so the total surface area is 4π R². So the hemisphere is 2π R². 20% of that is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R². So the spots cover 0.4 π R² of the star's surface.

Now, the star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler, so their temperature is 5000 K. The brightness variation comes from the spots rotating in and out of view as the star spins.

When the star is viewed such that the spot hemisphere is facing us, the total brightness would be a bit less because the spots are cooler. Since only one hemisphere is spotty, the maximum and minimum brightness would depend on the rotation.

Wait, but the star's rotation would cause the spots to come into and out of view. So when the spot hemisphere is visible, the brightness is lower than when it's not. The variation in brightness is due to the spots being cooler, so when the spot side is facing us, the star appears dimmer.

The question says that this situation can resemble an exoplanet. So the amplitude of the brightness variation (the dip in light curve) caused by the spots needs to be compared to the amplitude caused by a planet blocking some light (the transit method).

So, the change in brightness due to the spots would be the difference between the star's normal brightness and the brightness when the spots are visible.

The star's luminosity is given by L = 4π R² σ T^4, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. The spots contribute less to the luminosity. So the normal luminosity is L = 4π Rstar² σ (6000)^4.

The spots have an area A_spots = 0.2 * (hemisphere area) = 0.2 * 2π Rstar² = 0.4 π Rstar². Each spot has a temperature of 5000 K, so the luminosity from the spots would be L_spots = A_spots * σ (5000)^4.

The rest of the hemisphere (which is 80% of the hemisphere) is at 6000 K. The non-spot area in the hemisphere is 0.8 * 2π R² = 1.6 π R².

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute the total emitted flux when the spotty hemisphere is facing us, and when it's not. Because when the other hemisphere is facing us, all the star's surface is at 6000 K.

So the variation in brightness is the difference between when the spot hemisphere is visible (lower brightness) and when the non-spot hemisphere is visible (normal brightness).

Wait, but the star is a sphere. When the spot hemisphere is facing us, we see all of it. But when it's rotated, the other hemisphere (which is completely normal) comes into view. So the brightness variation is when the spot hemisphere is visible (low brightness) versus when the non-spot hemisphere is visible (high brightness).

So the maximum brightness variation would be when the spot hemisphere is fully visible. Let me compute the flux when the spot hemisphere is visible.

The flux from the spot hemisphere is the sum of the flux from the spots and the flux from the non-spots in that hemisphere.

The spot area is 0.4 π R², as earlier. The non-spot area in the hemisphere is (hemisphere area) - spot area = 2π R² - 0.4 π R² = 1.6 π R².

Flux from the spot area: A_spots * σ T_spot^4 = 0.4 π R² * σ (5000)^4.

Flux from the non-spot area in the hemisphere: 1.6 π R² * σ (6000)^4.

The other hemisphere, which is completely normal, when it's visible, would contribute 2π R² * σ (6000)^4.

Wait, no. When the star is viewed such that the spot hemisphere is facing us, the other hemisphere is on the back side and not visible. So in that case, the total flux is just the sum of the flux from the spot hemisphere. Wait, no, actually, the entire star's surface emits, but when the spot hemisphere is facing us, that's half the star's surface. So the flux from the spot hemisphere is (0.4π R²)(σ (5000)^4) + (1.6 π R²)(σ (6000)^4).

And when the other hemisphere is facing us, the flux is 2π R² (σ (6000)^4) plus the other 2π R² from the other side. Wait, no. Wait, the total surface area is 4π R². When the spot hemisphere is facing us, we see 2π R² of the star, which includes the spots. But the other 2π R² is on the back, which we can't see. So the flux when the spot hemisphere is visible is:

Flux_spot = [0.4 π R² * σ (5000)^4] + [1.6 π R² * σ (6000)^4 ]

Flux_normal = [2 π R² * σ (6000)^4 ] + [2 π R² * σ (6000)^4 ] = 4 π R² σ (6000)^4.

Wait, no, that can't be right. Because when the spot hemisphere is visible, the other hemisphere is not. So when the spot hemisphere is visible, the flux is the sum of the spot area and the non-spot area in that hemisphere.

Wait, no. Let me think again. Let's treat each hemisphere as separate.

The star has two hemispheres: one with spots (area 0.4 π R² of spots, and 1.6 π R² of normal surface), and the other hemisphere is entirely normal (2 π R²).

When the spot hemisphere is facing us, the flux is the sum of the spotted area and the non-spotted part of that hemisphere, which is 0.4 π R² (spots) and 1.6 π R² (normal).

Flux_spot = (0.4 π R²) σ (5000)^4 + (1.6 π R²) σ (6000)^4.

When the other hemisphere is facing us, the flux is 2 π R² σ (6000)^4 (from the non-spotty hemisphere) plus the backside of the spot hemisphere, which is not visible. Wait, no, when the spotty hemisphere is on the far side, we only see the non-spotty hemisphere, right?

Wait, no. Think about the star as a sphere. When the spot hemisphere is on the near side (facing Earth), then the spots contribute less to the flux. When the star rotates 180 degrees, the non-spotty hemisphere is facing us, so the entire hemisphere is at 6000 K, and the spot hemisphere is on the back, which we can't see.

So when the spot hemisphere is in front (facing us), the flux we receive is from the spot hemisphere. So the flux is (0.4 π R²)*σ*(5000)^4 + (1.6 π R²)*σ*(6000)^4. 

When the other hemisphere is facing us, the flux is 2 π R² * σ (6000)^4 (from the non-spotty hemisphere), plus the far side of the star (the spot hemisphere) which we can't see. No, wait, no. The far side of the spot hemisphere is on the opposite side, so we don't see any of it. The only part we see is the near side. So when the non-spotty hemisphere is facing us, the flux is 2 π R² * σ (6000)^4 (from the non-spotty hemisphere) plus the backside of the spot hemisphere, but wait, no, the spot hemisphere is on the far side, so we can't see any of it. So the only flux we receive is 2 π R² * σ (6000)^4.

Wait no, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me clarify.

The star's surface is divided into two hemispheres: the spot hemisphere (half the surface, 2π R²) and the non-spot hemisphere (2π R²). The spot hemisphere has 20% of its area covered by spots (so 0.4 π R² of spots and 1.6 π R² of normal). The non-spot hemisphere is entirely normal.

When the spot hemisphere is facing us, we see all of its surface (the 2π R²). So the flux is:

Flux_spot_hemi = (0.4 π R² * σ (5000^4)) + (1.6 π R² * σ (6000^4)).

When the non-spot hemisphere is facing us, the spot hemisphere is on the far side, and we can't see any of it. So the flux is:

Flux_non_spot_hemi = 2 π R² * σ (6000^4).

Wait, but the total flux when the non-spot hemisphere is facing us is just the flux from the non-spotty hemisphere. Because the spot hemisphere is on the back, so we can't see any of it. So the flux is 2 π R² * σ (6000^4).

So the maximum and minimum fluxes would be when the spot hemisphere is either facing or away.

But the star's rotation would cause the spot hemisphere to come into view, so the brightness variation is between Flux_spot_hemi and Flux_non_spot_hemi.

Wait, but the star is a sphere, so when the spot hemisphere is facing us, the flux is the sum of the spot and non-spot parts of that hemisphere. But when the non-spotty hemisphere is facing us, the flux is from that hemisphere only because the spot hemisphere is on the back.

So the star's total flux varies between Flux_spot_hemi and Flux_non_spot_hemi.

The amplitude of brightness variation (delta F) is the difference between the maximum and minimum flux.

Wait, but no. The variation would be when the spot hemisphere is facing us, so the flux is lower. When the non-spotty hemisphere is facing us, the flux is higher. So the maximum brightness is when the non-spotty hemisphere is visible, and the minimum is when the spot hemisphere is visible.

So the change in flux (delta F) is Flux_non_spot_hemi - Flux_spot_hemi.

Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the amplitude is the change from when the spot hemisphere is in front (lower flux) to when it's not (higher flux). So the maximum variation is the difference between the two fluxes.

Wait, perhaps another approach is to compute the average flux when the star is viewed from different angles.

Wait, but let's compute the flux when the spot hemisphere is in front and when it's not.

Compute Flux_spot = (0.4 π R² * σ (5000^4)) + (1.6 π R² * σ (6000^4)).

Compute Flux_non_spot = 2 π R² * σ (6000^4).

The delta F would be Flux_non_spot - Flux_spot.

Wait, but Flux_non_spot is when the non-spotty hemisphere is facing us, and Flux_spot is when the spotty hemisphere is facing us.

So delta F = (2 π R² σ (6000^4)) - [ (0.4 π R² σ 5000^4 ) + (1.6 π R² σ 6000^4) ) ]

Simplify that.

= 2 π R² σ (6000^4) - 0.4 π R² σ (5000^4) - 1.6 π R² σ (6000^4)

= [ 2 π R² σ (6000^4) - 1.6 π R² σ (6000^4) ] - 0.4 π R² σ (5000^4)

= (0.4 π R² σ (6000^4) ) - 0.4 π R² σ (5000^4 )

= 0.4 π R² σ [ (6000^4) - (5000^4) ]

Hmm, that's the change in flux (delta F) when the star rotates so that the non-spotty hemisphere is visible, compared to the spot hemisphere.

But wait, the star's total flux when spot hemisphere is visible is Flux_spot, and when non-spotty is visible, it's Flux_non_spot. So the variation is Flux_non_spot - Flux_spot = delta F.

Now, the amplitude of the brightness variation is the change in flux divided by the original flux.

The original flux (when the non-spotty hemisphere is visible) is Flux_non_spot = 2 π R² σ (6000^4).

So the relative change is delta F / Flux_non_spot.

Let me compute that.

delta F = 0.4 π R² σ (6000^4 - 5000^4 )

Flux_non_spot = 2 π R² σ (6000^4 )

So delta F / Flux_non_spot = [0.4 π R² σ (6000^4 - 5000^4 ) ] / [2 π R² σ (6000^4) ].

Simplify:

= (0.4 / 2) * (6000^4 -5000^4 ) / (6000^4 )

= 0.2 * [ (6000^4 -5000^4) / 6000^4 ]

Compute the terms:

6000^4 = (6e3)^4 = 6^4 * 1e12 = 1296e12.

5000^4 = 5^4 * 1e12 = 625e12.

6000^4 -5000^4 = (1296e12 - 625e12) = 671e12.

So (671e12) / (1296e12) = 671/1296 ≈ 0.5176.

So 0.2 * 0.5176 ≈ 0.1035, or about 10.35% relative change.

Wait, but that seems high. Because the absolute change is about 10% of the star's flux.

Hmm, but wait: the star's luminosity when the spot hemisphere is facing us is Flux_spot, and when the non-spotty is facing us, it's Flux_non_spot. So the variation is Flux_non_spot - Flux_spot, which is what we calculated as delta F.

But the star's brightness without any spots would have been Flux_non_spot always. So the relative change is (delta F) / Flux_non_spot, which is about 0.1035, or 10.35% change in brightness when the star rotates.

Wait, but in reality, when the star is spot-free, the brightness doesn't vary. But in this case, the spots cause a variation of about 10% when it's rotating.

But the question is asking, if there were no spots, what exoplanet radius would cause the same amplitude in brightness variation? So the transit method's dip would have to be the same as this 10.35% (approximately 10%) change.

Wait, but let me think again. The transit method's dip is when the planet blocks part of the star's light. The dip is (Rp/Rstar)^2. So if the dip is 10%, then (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.10, so Rp/Rstar = sqrt(0.10) ≈ 0.316.

Wait, but wait—the dip is the fraction of the star's light blocked. So if the dip is 10%, then (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.10. So Rp is sqrt(0.10) × Rstar, which is about 0.316 Rstar. So the radius is about 0.32 Rstar. Looking at the options, option D is ~0.32.

But wait, earlier I calculated the brightness variation as about 10.35%. So the planet would need a radius that causes a 10.35% dip. So (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.1035 → Rp/Rstar ≈ sqrt(0.1035) ≈ 0.3218.

So the planet's radius is approximately 0.32 times the star's radius. Which is option D.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating delta F. Let me double-check.

Wait, another approach: the spots cause a dip in brightness when they're on the near side. The dip is the difference between the star's normal flux and the flux when the spots are visible. Let me compute that.

The star's total flux without any spots would be L = 4 π R² σ (6000^4).

When the spot hemisphere is visible, the flux is L_spot = (0.4 π R² σ (5000^4)) + (1.6 π R² σ (6000^4)) + (2 π R² σ (6000^4)) ? No, wait no—because when the spot hemisphere is facing us, the other hemisphere is on the back, so we don't see it. So the flux when spot hemisphere is visible is only the sum of the spot area and the non-spot area in the hemisphere, which is 0.4 π R² σ (5000^4) + 1.6 π R² σ (6000^4).

And when the non-spotty hemisphere is facing us, the flux is 2 π R² σ (6000^4) (from the non-spotty hemisphere) plus the other hemisphere which we can't see. Wait, no: when non-spotty is facing, the flux is 2 π R² σ (6000^4), because that's the entire hemisphere we can see.

Wait, no. The star's total surface area is 4 π R². When the spot hemisphere is visible, we see 2 π R² (the spot hemisphere), and when the non-spotty hemisphere is visible, we see 2 π R² (the non-spotty hemisphere). So the flux when spot hemisphere is visible is L_spot = 0.4 π R² σ (5000^4) + 1.6 π R² σ (6000^4).

The flux when the non-spotty hemisphere is visible is L_non_spot = 2 π R² σ (6000^4).

So the dip in brightness (delta L) is L_non_spot - L_spot.

Compute that:

delta L = (2 π R² σ (6000^4)) - [ 0.4 π R² σ (5000^4) + 1.6 π R² σ (6000^4) ) ]

= 2 π R² σ (6000^4) - 0.4 π R² σ (5000^4) - 1.6 π R² σ (6000^4)

= (2 - 1.6) π R² σ (6000^4) - 0.4 π R² σ (5000^4)

= 0.4 π R² σ (6000^4) - 0.4 π R² σ (5000^4)

= 0.4 π R² σ [ (6000^4 - 5000^4) ]

Which is what I had earlier.

Now, the star's total luminosity without spots is L_total = 4 π R² σ (6000^4).

So the relative dip is (delta L) / L_total ?

Wait, no. Because when the spot hemisphere is visible, the flux is L_spot, which is less than L_non_spot. So the dip is when the spot hemisphere is visible, the brightness is lower. So the dip amplitude is (L_non_spot - L_spot) / L_non_spot.

Wait, because L_non_spot is the maximum brightness, and L_spot is the minimum when the spot hemisphere is visible.

So the amplitude is (L_non_spot - L_spot) / L_non_spot.

Which is what I calculated earlier as approximately 10.35%.

So the planet's transit would need to cause the same 10.35% dip. So (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.1035 → Rp/Rstar ≈ 0.3218, so approximately 0.32, which is option D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation as the spotted star, we analyze the situation as follows:

### Key Information:
1. **Star Properties**:
   - Radius: \( R_{\text{star}} \) (same as the Sun).
   - Effective temperature: \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \).
   - One hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%.
   - Spots are cooler, with a temperature difference of \( \Delta T = 1000 \, \text{K} \) (spot temperature \( T_{\text{spot}} = 5000 \, \text{K} \)).

2. **Brightness Variation**:
   - The star's brightness varies due to the rotation of the spotty hemisphere, which alternates between being visible and hidden.
   - The flux from the star depends on the temperature of the visible regions. When the spotty hemisphere is visible, the flux is reduced due to the cooler spots.

3. **Flux Calculations**:
   - The total surface area of the star is \( 4\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \), and the area of one hemisphere is \( 2\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \).
   - The spotty hemisphere has 20% of its area covered by spots, so the spot area is \( 0.2 \times 2\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 = 0.4\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \). The remaining 80% of the hemisphere is normal, with an area of \( 1.6\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \).
   - The flux from the spotty hemisphere is:
     \[
     L_{\text{spot}} = (0.4\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \cdot \sigma \cdot T_{\text{spot}}^4) + (1.6\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \cdot \sigma \cdot T_{\text{eff}}^4)
     \]
   - The flux from the non-spotty hemisphere is:
     \[
     L_{\text{non-spot}} = 2\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \cdot \sigma \cdot T_{\text{eff}}^4
     \]

4. **Brightness Variation Amplitude**:
   - The brightness variation is the difference in flux between when the non-spotty hemisphere is visible (\( L_{\text{non-spot}} \)) and when the spotty hemisphere is visible (\( L_{\text{spot}} \)):
     \[
     \Delta L = L_{\text{non-spot}} - L_{\text{spot}}
     \]
   - Substituting the expressions for \( L_{\text{non-spot}} \) and \( L_{\text{spot}} \):
     \[
     \Delta L = 2\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \cdot \sigma \cdot T_{\text{eff}}^4 - \left[ 0.4\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \cdot \sigma \cdot T_{\text{spot}}^4 + 1.6\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \cdot \sigma \cdot T_{\text{eff}}^4 \right]
     \]
   - Simplifying:
     \[
     \Delta L = 0.4\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \cdot \sigma \cdot T_{\text{eff}}^4 - 0.4\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \cdot \sigma \cdot T_{\text{spot}}^4
     \]
     \[
     \Delta L = 0.4\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \cdot \sigma \cdot \left( T_{\text{eff}}^4 - T_{\text{spot}}^4 \right)
     \]

5. **Relative Brightness Variation**:
   - The relative brightness variation is:
     \[
     \frac{\Delta L}{L_{\text{non-spot}}} = \frac{0.4\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \cdot \sigma \cdot \left( T_{\text{eff}}^4 - T_{\text{spot}}^4 \right)}{2\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \cdot \sigma \cdot T_{\text{eff}}^4}
     \]
   - Simplifying:
     \[
     \frac{\Delta L}{L_{\text{non-spot}}} = 0.2 \cdot \frac{T_{\text{eff}}^4 - T_{\text{spot}}^4}{T_{\text{eff}}^4}
     \]
   - Substituting \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \) and \( T_{\text{spot}} = 5000 \, \text{K} \):
     \[
     \frac{\Delta L}{L_{\text{non-spot}}} = 0.2 \cdot \frac{6000^4 - 5000^4}{6000^4}
     \]
   - Compute \( 6000^4 = 1296 \times 10^{12} \) and \( 5000^4 = 625 \times 10^{12} \):
     \[
     \frac{\Delta L}{L_{\text{non-spot}}} = 0.2 \cdot \frac{1296 \times 10^{12} - 625 \times 10^{12}}{1296 \times 10^{12}}
     \]
     \[
     \frac{\Delta L}{L_{\text{non-spot}}} = 0.2 \cdot \frac{671 \times 10^{12}}{1296 \times 10^{12}} \approx 0.2 \cdot 0.5176 \approx 0.1035 \, (10.35\%)
     \]

6. **Exoplanet Radius for Same Brightness Variation**:
   - The brightness variation caused by a transiting exoplanet is given by the transit depth:
     \[
     \text{Transit Depth} = \left( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2
     \]
   - To match the brightness variation of \( 0.1035 \), we set:
     \[
     \left( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2 = 0.1035
     \]
   - Solving for \( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \):
     \[
     \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} = \sqrt{0.1035} \approx 0.322
     \]

### Conclusion:
The radius of the hypothetical exoplanet, relative to the host star, is approximately \( 0.32 \). This corresponds to **Option D**.

ANSWER: D
