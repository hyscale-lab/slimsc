Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.

The question is about selecting the correct reagents for two reactions. The first reaction is between butan-2-one and NaCN with some reagent A, producing 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction starts with 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile and uses reagent B (along with water) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

The options given are A, B, C, D, each pairing reagents A and B. The options are:

A) A = H3O+, B = HCl
B) A = H3O+, B = CH3COOH
C) A = NaHSO3, B = HCl
D) A = NaHSO3, B = CH3COOH

Hmm. I remember that when ketones react with nitriles, it's typically a nucleophilic addition. So butan-2-one is a ketone, right? The structure is (CH3)2CO. Adding NaCN would involve the ketone undergoing an addition of the cyanide ion.

Wait, but in the product, we have a hydroxyl group and a nitrile. Oh wait, butan-2-one has two methyl groups attached to the carbonyl. Let me think. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So the structure would be CH2(CO-OH)(CN)CH3? Wait, no. Wait, butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN, but with substituents.

Wait, but butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. When it reacts with NaCN, under certain conditions, the ketone may undergo addition of CN-.

Wait, but in the product, there's a hydroxyl group. Oh wait, maybe it's a condensation reaction. Wait, no, maybe it's a two-step process. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is between a ketone and a nitrile in the presence of an acid catalyst, leading to a substitution.

Wait, or maybe it's the formation of a cyanohydrin. Oh right! Cyanohydrin formation. So when a ketone reacts with a nitrile (like HCN or a nitrile salt), in the presence of an acid catalyst, it forms a cyanohydrin. The cyanohydrin is a compound with a hydroxyl group and a nitrile group added to the carbonyl carbon.

So the first reaction is forming a cyanohydrin. The general reaction is ketone + HCN → cyanohydrin. But in this question, NaCN is used. So NaCN is providing CN⁻, and perhaps with an acid catalyst. Oh wait, but NaCN is a source of CN-; if the solution is acidic, H+ would be present. So maybe reagent A is an acid, like H3O+.

So for the first reaction, A is H3O+. Looking at the options, options A and B have A as H3O+.

Now, the second reaction. The starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile, and the product is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. So the nitrile group (-CN) is being oxidized to a carboxylic acid (-COOH). 

Nitrile oxidation to carboxylic acid typically requires strong oxidizing agents. Common reagents include KMnO4 under acidic conditions, or other strong oxidizing agents like HClO4. Alternatively, using H2O and an acid catalyst might not be enough. Wait, but looking at the reagents in the options, B is either HCl or acetic acid (CH3COOH). Oh wait, but the second reaction uses reagent B along with water.

Wait, the reaction is: nitrile → carboxylic acid. So the nitrile is at a certain position. Let me think about the conditions. One way to oxidize nitriles is using KMnO4 under acidic conditions, followed by H+ and heat. Alternatively, using HClO4 or other concentrated acids as oxidizing agents.

But in the options, B is either HCl or acetic acid. Hmm. Another possibility is that the nitrile is converted to an amide first, but that's not the case here. Alternatively, maybe it's a hydrolysis reaction. Wait, nitriles can be hydrolyzed to carboxylic acids under certain conditions. But what reagents are needed for that?

Yes, nitriles can be hydrolyzed to carboxylic acids using strong acid and water. For example, when a nitrile is treated with concentrated HCl (like HCl with H2O and heat), it can produce a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, using H3O+ and H2O might not be enough, but perhaps the presence of HCl (as a catalyst) is needed.

Wait, let me think. The hydrolysis of nitriles can proceed through different mechanisms. For example, using H2O with an acid catalyst like HCl (concentrated) can lead to the formation of the amide intermediate, which then further hydrolyzes to the carboxylic acid. 

Wait, but the first step is hydrolysis of nitrile to amide, which requires either strong base or acid. In acidic conditions, nitriles can be hydrolyzed to amides, which in the presence of more H2O and acid can go on to form the carboxylic acid.

So in the second reaction, reagent B plus H2O is causing the nitrile group to become a carboxylic acid. So if B is HCl (option A or C), then the reaction would involve HCl as the acid catalyst. Alternatively, if B is acetic acid (option B or D), then maybe it's a milder condition.

Wait, but acetic acid is a weak acid. For strong oxidation, perhaps a strong acid like HCl is needed. So to hydrolyze the nitrile to a carboxylic acid, concentrated HCl (as a proton source and catalyst) would be suitable.

Looking at the options, for the second reaction:

If A is H3O+ (like in options A and B), then B in the second reaction is either HCl or CH3COOH. If the second reaction uses HCl, that would fit with the need for strong acid. So looking at options, option A has B = HCl, option C has B=HCl but A is NaHSO3.

Wait, but the second reaction's reagent B is either HCl or acetic acid. So which is the correct reagent?

Wait, another approach: in the first reaction, the reagent A is H3O+ (acid). So options A and B are the ones with A as H3O+.

So the first reaction is a cyanohydrin formation, requiring acid (H3O+). So A is H3O+.

Now, in the second reaction, the nitrile becomes a carboxylic acid. So we need to hydrolyze the nitrile. Let's consider the conditions.

If the reagent B is HCl, then in the second reaction, HCl provides the acidic conditions for the hydrolysis. So using concentrated HCl and water, with heat, would hydrolyze the nitrile to the carboxylic acid. Alternatively, another possibility is using H2O with an acid catalyst like HCl.

Wait, but the product is a carboxylic acid, which is the fully oxidized form. So for a nitrile to carboxylic acid, the typical reagents are strong oxidizing agents, but in this case, perhaps it's hydrolysis under strong acidic conditions.

Wait, another method: nitrile hydrolysis can be done in acidic conditions with HgSO4 and H2SO4, but I'm not sure if that's in the options. Alternatively, using KMnO4 under acidic conditions. But the options don't have KMnO4.

Alternatively, using HCl as the acid catalyst along with water could work. Because concentrated HCl can act as a strong acid, aiding in the hydrolysis.

So for the second reaction, reagent B is HCl (so option A, where B is HCl, or option C, where A is NaHSO3 and B is HCl). But earlier, the first reaction uses A = H3O+.

Wait, so which options have A = H3O+? Options A and B. So for the second reaction, if B is HCl, then the correct option would be A (A = H3O+, B = HCl). But wait, let's think again.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. The second reaction is: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H2O) → 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

So the reagent B is part of the reaction, along with water. So the reaction is hydrolysis of the nitrile group to a carboxylic acid. The presence of an acid catalyst would facilitate this.

So if B is HCl, then the solution is acidic, which would help in the hydrolysis. Alternatively, if B is CH3COOH (which is a weak acid), would that be sufficient?

Wait, the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids can be done using strong acids. So using HCl would be more effective. But I'm not sure about the conditions.

Wait, another thought: if the nitrile is already adjacent to a hydroxyl group, perhaps the conditions are milder. Maybe the hydroxyl group could help in the reaction, like facilitating some kind of intramolecular reaction. Alternatively, if the nitrile is in a hindered position, maybe it's more reactive.

Wait, but the product is a carboxylic acid. So the nitrile has to be oxidized. Another approach: sometimes, when a nitrile is treated with H2O under acidic conditions with a strong acid catalyst, it can form an amide, and then further oxidation would be needed. But I'm not sure.

Wait, wait, no. Alternatively, perhaps the nitrile is being converted via hydrolysis to an amide, then to a carboxylic acid. But for that, HCl would be a strong acid catalyst.

Wait, but in the options, looking at the possibilities, if A is H3O+ for the first reaction, then the second reaction's B is either HCl (option A) or acetic acid (option B). Which of these would facilitate the nitrile to carboxylic acid conversion?

I think concentrated HCl is better for this purpose because it's a strong acid and a good catalyst for the hydrolysis. Acetic acid is a weak acid and might not provide enough acidity for the reaction to proceed efficiently. So in that case, option A (A=H3O+, B=HCl) would be correct.

But wait, another angle: sometimes, when you have a NaHSO3 (sodium bisulfate), it can act as a source of H+ and SO3^2-. But I'm not sure how that would apply here. Wait, the first reaction is forming a cyanohydrin. I think the presence of an acid is necessary for that, so NaHSO3 would provide H+.

Wait, but wait: NaHSO3 is a source of H+ and SO3^2- ions. When dissolved in water, it would release H+ and HS03^- which can act as a buffer. So if A is NaHSO3, then perhaps it's providing the H+ needed for the first reaction.

So for the first reaction, if A is NaHSO3, then it's providing the acidic conditions. So that's another possibility. So options C and D have A as NaHSO3.

So then, in the first reaction, whether A is H3O+ or NaHSO3.

Wait, NaHSO3 is a weaker acid than H3O+ (which is a strong acid). But for the cyanohydrin formation, does the strength of the acid matter?

Cyanohydrin formation typically uses an acid catalyst, which can be H+ from H3O+ or from other sources like H2SO4, etc. So NaHSO3 would provide H+ as well, so perhaps it can also act as an acid catalyst for the first reaction.

So now I'm a bit confused. Both options where A is H3O+ or NaHSO3 could work for the first reaction.

But for the second reaction, whether B is HCl or another reagent.

Wait, going back to the second reaction: the starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. So the structure is something like:

Ph-C6H4-CH2-C(OH)(CN)-CH2-CH3? Not exactly, but the nitrile is attached to the same carbon as the hydroxyl group.

So when this is treated with B (which is either HCl or acetic acid) and H2O, it becomes a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but if the nitrile is adjacent to a hydroxyl group, perhaps oxidation is easier. Alternatively, perhaps it's a case of acid-catalyzed hydrolysis.

Wait, but another thought: the presence of the hydroxyl group might make the adjacent carbon more susceptible to attack. So the nitrile group (-CN) is attached to a carbon that has a hydroxyl group (-OH). So under acidic conditions, perhaps the nitrile can undergo hydrolysis more readily.

Wait, nitriles can be hydrolyzed to amides or acids under acidic or basic conditions. In this case, the product is a carboxylic acid, so the conditions must be acidic.

So for the second reaction, the reagent B must be an acid. So options A and C have B as HCl, while B and D have B as CH3COOH.

Which of these is a strong enough acid to drive the hydrolysis to the carboxylic acid?

HCl is a strong acid. Acetic acid is a weak acid. So using HCl would be more effective in providing the acidic conditions needed for the hydrolysis.

So for the second reaction, B should be HCl.

Then, for the first reaction, if A is H3O+ (options A and B), then the correct option would be A (B=HCl) or C (A=NaHSO3, B=HCl). Wait, but in the options, option C has A=NaHSO3 and B=HCl.

So I'm trying to decide between options A and C now.

Wait, the first reaction is butan-2-one + NaCN + A → 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile.

So in the first reaction, the reagent A is either H3O+ or NaHSO3.

But NaHSO3 would provide H+ as well. So both could theoretically act as acid catalysts for the cyanohydrin formation.

But wait, butan-2-one is a ketone. The reaction with CN- would require an acid catalyst. So either H3O+ or NaHSO3 could work.

So for the first reaction, both A and C could be options.

But the second reaction requires B to be HCl for the acid. So the options that have B=HCl are options A and C.

So now, between options A and C.

In option A, A is H3O+ and B is HCl.

In option C, A is NaHSO3 and B is HCl.

Which is correct?

Wait, another thought: what's the role of A in the first reaction? The first reaction is the formation of a cyanohydrin from a ketone and CN-.

The reaction mechanism: the ketone is protonated (acid catalyzed), making the carbonyl more electrophilic. Then CN- attacks the carbonyl carbon, forming a tetrahedral intermediate, which then loses water to form the cyanohydrin.

So the acid is acting as a catalyst, protonating the ketone.

In this case, both H3O+ and NaHSO3 (which would supply H+) can act as the acid catalyst.

So both options A and C are possible for the first reaction, but wait, looking again at the options:

Option A: A=H3O+, B=HCl.

Option C: A=NaHSO3, B=HCl.

Which one is correct?

Wait, but maybe the first reaction doesn't require a strong acid. For cyanohydrin formation, sometimes the conditions can be mildly acidic. NaHSO3 is a moderately strong acid (HSO3^- is a weak base), so it can provide H+.

Alternatively, the NaHSO3 might not be necessary if H3O+ is a strong enough acid.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps NaHSO3 is used in another context, like in the case of the formation of the cyanohydrin. Wait, another possibility: maybe the NaCN is being used in a solution where the pH is controlled. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the first reaction uses NaHSO3 as the acid because it's a source of H+ and also provides SO3^2- which could act as a base in some reactions. But in the cyanohydrin formation, the presence of H+ is the main thing.

Now, considering the reagents in the options, if option C uses NaHSO3 as A, then the first reaction would proceed, and the second reaction would use HCl as B, which is correct.

But I'm not entirely certain. Another approach: perhaps the first reaction uses H3O+ as the acid catalyst, making option A the right choice.

Wait, but I'm not entirely confident. Let me think about the pKa values.

H3O+ is a strong acid (pKa ~-1.7), while NaHSO3 is a weaker acid. HSO3^- has a pKa around 1.8 (I think). So in solution, NaHSO3 would provide H+ with a lower concentration than H3O+.

But for the cyanohydrin reaction, perhaps a weaker acid is sufficient. So maybe either reagent would work.

Wait, but in which conditions is NaHSO3 used? I'm not as familiar, but H3O+ is a common acid catalyst in such reactions.

So perhaps the correct option is A, where A is H3O+ and B is HCl.

But wait, looking at the product of the first reaction: 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile.

Wait, but butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Adding cyanide would give a structure where the nitrile and hydroxyl are on the same carbon as the former carbonyl.

So the product would be (CH3)2C(OH)CN. Which is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Hmm, but wait, butanenitrile would be four carbons, but here the product has (CH3)2C(OH)CN, which is three carbons. Wait, perhaps the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylpropanenitrile? Or maybe butanenitrile refers to a four-carbon chain. I'm a bit confused about the structure, but perhaps it's not critical for the reagent selection.

So, to recap: For the first reaction, any acid catalyst (H3O+ or NaHSO3) would work, and for the second reaction, HCl is the correct reagent.

So the options are A and C. Now, which one is correct?

Wait, looking at the options:

Option A: A = H3O+, B=HCl.

Option C: A=NaHSO3, B=HCl.

I think that the first reaction uses H3O+ as the acid catalyst because it's a straightforward choice for such reactions. So option A would have the correct reagents.

Wait, but the second reaction would require the nitrile to be oxidized to a carboxylic acid. So using HCl (a strong acid) makes sense for that step.

So putting it all together, the correct reagents would be A=H3O+ and B=HCl. So option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves selecting the correct reagents for two reactions. The first reaction involves the formation of a cyanohydrin from butan-2-one and NaCN, while the second reaction involves the oxidation of a nitrile group to a carboxylic acid.

### Reaction 1: Formation of Cyanohydrin
The first reaction is the formation of 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile from butan-2-one and NaCN. This is a nucleophilic addition reaction where the cyanide ion (CN⁻) attacks the carbonyl carbon of the ketone. An acid catalyst is required to protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making the carbonyl carbon more electrophilic. Both H₃O⁺ (a strong acid) and NaHSO₃ (a source of H⁺ and SO₃²⁻) can act as acid catalysts. H₃O⁺ is a common choice for such reactions due to its strong acidity, but NaHSO₃ could also work as it provides H⁺.

### Reaction 2: Oxidation of Nitrile to Carboxylic Acid
The second reaction involves the conversion of 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile to 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. This requires the nitrile group (-CN) to be hydrolyzed to a carboxylic acid (-COOH). This process typically requires acidic conditions, and HCl is a strong acid that can effectively catalyze this reaction. Acetic acid (CH₃COOH), being a weak acid, is less likely to provide the necessary acidic environment for this transformation.

### Analysis of Options
- **Option A**: A = H₃O⁺, B = HCl  
  - H₃O⁺ is a suitable acid catalyst for the first reaction, and HCl is appropriate for the second reaction. This combination is valid.

- **Option B**: A = H₃O⁺, B = CH₃COOH  
  - H₃O⁺ is suitable for the first reaction, but CH₃COOH is not strong enough to effectively hydrolyze the nitrile to a carboxylic acid in the second reaction. This combination is incorrect.

- **Option C**: A = NaHSO₃, B = HCl  
  - NaHSO₃ can act as an acid catalyst for the first reaction, and HCl is suitable for the second reaction. This combination is valid.

- **Option D**: A = NaHSO₃, B = CH₃COOH  
  - NaHSO₃ is suitable for the first reaction, but CH₃COOH is not strong enough for the second reaction. This combination is incorrect.

### Conclusion
Both options A and C are valid based on the analysis. However, H₃O⁺ is a more straightforward and common choice for the first reaction, making **Option A** the most appropriate answer.

Answer: A
