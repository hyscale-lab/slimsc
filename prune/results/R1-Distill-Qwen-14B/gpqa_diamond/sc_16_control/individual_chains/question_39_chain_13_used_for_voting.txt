Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me read through it again and try to figure out what's going on. 

So, the setup is we have a large number of identical systems—like 10,000. Each system has a particle that behaves the same way under the same conditions. The particles can move along a tube, which is the x-axis. 

The wave function for each particle is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Oh wait, wait—that's probably (a / sqrt(1 + x)) multiplied by i^0.5? No, wait, because the square root of -1 is i. So actually, the wave function is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) times (1 - 0.5i), maybe? Or wait, maybe it's (a divided by sqrt(1+x)) multiplied by i^0.5? Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's parse the equation again. 

The wave function is written as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Wait, that can't be right because the wave function is usually a complex number. So perhaps the real part is a/sqrt(1+x), and the imaginary part is -0.5. Like, ψ(x) = (a/sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Or maybe it's written as a combination of terms, but the way it's presented is a bit confusing. 

Wait, the problem says the wave function is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Oh wait, perhaps it's (a / sqrt(1 + x)) multiplied by (1 - 0.5i), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, it's the real part being a/sqrt(1+x), and the imaginary part being -0.5. So the wave function is a complex number: ψ(x) = [a/(sqrt(1+x))] + [ (-0.5) i ].

Wait, but that doesn't make much sense in terms of normalization because the imaginary part would be a constant. That seems unusual. Alternatively, maybe the wave function is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) multiplied by (1 - 0.5i). So the entire term (1 - 0.5i) is a coefficient, but that might complicate the normalization. Hmm, maybe I'm misinterpreting the wave function.

Wait, the problem states that the wave function is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. So the real part is a/sqrt(1+x), and the imaginary part is -0.5.

Wait, but then the wave function is ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5 i. Which can be written as ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1+x)) ) + ( -0.5 ) i. 

But wait, in quantum mechanics, the wave function is usually a complex function, but for normalization, the integral of |ψ|^2 must be 1. So the modulus squared is |ψ|^2 = (a^2)/(1 + x) + (0.5)^2, because (Imaginary part is -0.5, so its square is (0.5)^2). Wait, no—that's only if the real and imaginary parts are separate. But if the wave function is written as [a / sqrt(1+x)] + (-0.5)i, then the modulus squared would be [a/(sqrt(1+x))]^2 + (0.5)^2. So |ψ(x)|^2 = [a²/(1+x)] + 0.25.

But wait, that would complicate the integral over x. Because when we integrate |ψ|^2 dx from x=1 to x=3, it should equal 1. So the normalization condition is ∫ |ψ(x)|² dx from 1 to 3 equals 1.

Wait, but if the wave function is ψ(x) = [a/sqrt(1+x)] + (-0.5)i, then |ψ|² = [a²/(1+x)] + [0.25]. Because (a²)/(1+x) is the square of the real part, and (0.5)^2 is the square of the imaginary part. So the modulus squared is the sum of squares? Or wait, no—that's only if the real and imaginary parts are independent. Wait, no, the modulus squared is (Re(ψ))² + (Im(ψ))². So if ψ(x) = A + B i, then |ψ|^2 = A² + B². So in this case, A = a/(sqrt(1+x)), B = -0.5, so |ψ|^2 = [a²/(1+x)] + (0.5)^2.

So the normalization integral is:

∫ (from x=1 to x=3) [ (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx = 1.

But wait, that seems a bit complicated. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the wave function. Maybe the wave function is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) multiplied by (1 - 0.5i), so ψ(x) = [ a(1 - 0.5i) ] / sqrt(1 + x). In that case, the modulus squared would be [a² (1^2 + (0.5)^2)] / (1 + x) ) = [a² (1 + 0.25)] / (1 + x) ) = [a² * 1.25]/(1+x). Then the integral becomes 1.25 a² ∫ dx/(1+x) from 1 to 3.

Wait, but this would be a different setup. So whether the wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) plus a constant imaginary part, or a product with a complex number, makes a big difference in normalization.

Hmm. Let me read the problem statement again. The wave function is written as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. So perhaps it's ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1+x)) ) - 0.5i. So real part is a/(sqrt(1+x)), imaginary is -0.5.

So the modulus squared is [a²/(1+x)] + (0.5)^2. So |ψ|^2 = a²/(1+x) + 0.25.

Wait, but this would make the integral ∫ (a²/(1+x) + 0.25) dx from 1 to 3 equals 1.

So let's compute that:

Breaking it into two integrals:

Integral of a²/(1+x) dx from 1 to 3: a² [ln(1+x)] from 1 to 3.

Which is a² (ln(4) - ln(2)) ) = a² ln(2).

Integral of 0.25 dx from 1 to 3 is 0.25*(3-1) = 0.25*2=0.5.

So total integral is a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So a² ln(2) = 0.5 → a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

Compute ln(2) ≈ 0.6931.

So a² ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7202 → a ≈ sqrt(0.7202) ≈ 0.8487.

Looking at the options: B is 0.85, which is close.

Wait, but let me double-check. Because the problem statement says that when measuring the position, none were found outside x=1 and x=3. So the wave function is zero outside that interval? Or perhaps the wave function is defined as given only between x=1 and 3. So the wave function is zero elsewhere. But for normalization, we integrate from 1 to 3.

Wait, so the wave function is zero for x <1 and x>3. So the integral is only over 1 to 3.

So, going back, the integral is a² ln(2) + 0.5 =1 → a² = (0.5)/ (ln 2) → a ≈ sqrt(0.5/0.6931) ≈ sqrt(0.7202) ≈ 0.8487, which is approximately 0.85. So option B is 0.85.

But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the modulus squared. Let me think again. If the wave function is ψ(x) = [a/(sqrt(1+x))] - 0.5i, then the modulus squared is [a/(sqrt(1+x))]^2 + (0.5)^2 = a²/(1+x) + 0.25. So the integral is ∫ (a²/(1+x) + 0.25) dx from 1 to 3 = 1.

Yes, that's correct. So the calculations proceed as I did.

Wait, but wait another thing. The wave function for a particle in a box typically has nodes where the probability is zero. But in this case, the problem states that none were found outside x=1 and x=3. So perhaps the wave function is zero outside and the given function inside. But in the problem statement, the wave function is given as (a/sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i, which I'm taking as the expression within x=1 and x=3.

So the normalization integral is correct as I did. So a is approximately 0.85, which is option B.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the expression for the modulus squared. Let me think: ψ(x) = real part + imaginary part i. So modulus squared is (Re(ψ))² + (Im(ψ))². So yes, that part is correct.

Another approach: Compute the integral and solve for a.

Compute the integral:

∫ [a²/(1+x) + 0.25] dx from 1 to 3.

The integral of a²/(1+x) is a² ln(1+x). Evaluated from 1 to 3: a² (ln(4) - ln(2)) ) = a² ln(2).

The integral of 0.25 is 0.25*(3-1) = 0.5.

So total is a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1 → a² ln(2) = 0.5 → a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

Compute ln(2): approximately 0.693147.

0.5 / 0.693147 ≈ 0.7202.

Square root of 0.7202 is approximately 0.8487, so a ≈ 0.8487 ≈ 0.85.

Looking at the options, B is 0.85. So the answer is B.

The problem involves determining the normalization constant \( a \) for a wave function of the form:

\[
\psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i
\]

The wave function is valid only between \( x = 1 \) and \( x = 3 \), and the normalization condition requires that:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} |\psi(x)|^2 \, dx = 1
\]

The modulus squared of the wave function is:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25
\]

The normalization integral becomes:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1
\]

This integral can be split into two parts:

1. **First term**: \( \int_{1}^{3} \frac{a^2}{1+x} \, dx \)

   The integral of \( \frac{1}{1+x} \) is \( \ln(1+x) \). Evaluating this from \( x = 1 \) to \( x = 3 \):

   \[
   a^2 \left[\ln(1+x)\right]_{1}^{3} = a^2 \left(\ln(4) - \ln(2)\right) = a^2 \ln(2)
   \]

2. **Second term**: \( \int_{1}^{3} 0.25 \, dx \)

   The integral of \( 0.25 \) over \( x \) from 1 to 3 is:

   \[
   0.25 \cdot (3-1) = 0.5
   \]

Combining these results, the normalization condition becomes:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1
\]

Rearranging for \( a^2 \):

\[
a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}
\]

Using \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \):

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7202
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
a \approx \sqrt{0.7202} \approx 0.8487
\]

This value is closest to \( 0.85 \), which corresponds to option **B**.

Answer: B
