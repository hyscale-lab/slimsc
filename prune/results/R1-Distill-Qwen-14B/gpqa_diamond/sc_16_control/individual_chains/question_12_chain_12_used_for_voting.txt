Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a pion into a muon and a neutrino. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on particle physics, but I'll try to think through it step by step.

The problem states that a Pi(+) is at rest and decays into a mu(+) and a neutrino. The rest masses are given: the pion is 139.6 MeV, and the muon is 105.7 MeV. I need to find the kinetic energies of the product particles. The options are A, B, C, D with different values.

Wait, neutrinos are tricky because they're leptons, but in this case, they have negligible mass, right? So for the purpose of calculations, we can treat the neutrino as massless. That might simplify things.

Since the pion is at rest, the total initial momentum is zero. So the momenta of the muon and neutrino must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. So p_mu = -p_nu. But since the neutrino's mass is negligible, its energy is just pc. So E_nu = |p| c. For the muon, E_mu would be sqrt( (pc c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2 ) / c^2, but I'm not sure about the exact units here.

Wait, using natural units where c=1 might make this easier. So, in natural units, energy and mass are in MeV, and momentum is in MeV/c, but since we set c=1, momentum is in MeV. So, the total energy before decay is just the rest mass of the pion, 139.6 MeV. After decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino.

So, E_total = E_mu + E_nu = 139.6 MeV.

Also, since momentum must be conserved, p_mu = -p_nu. So, p_mu = p, and p_nu = -p? Wait, no. The magnitudes are equal, but directions opposite. So, |p_mu| = |p_nu|=p.

The muon's energy is E_mu = sqrt( p^2 + m_mu^2 ), and the neutrino's energy is E_nu = p (since its mass is zero). So, E_mu + E_nu = sqrt(p^2 + (105.7)^2) + p = 139.6.

Hmm, that seems like an equation we can solve for p. Let me write that:

sqrt(p^2 + (105.7)^2) + p = 139.6

Let me rearrange this:

sqrt(p^2 + (105.7)^2) = 139.6 - p

Now, square both sides to eliminate the square root:

p^2 + (105.7)^2 = (139.6 - p)^2

Expanding the right side:

= (139.6)^2 - 2*139.6*p + p^2

Subtract p^2 from both sides:

105.7^2 = 139.6^2 - 2*139.6*p

Let me compute these squares.

105.7^2 = approx 11173.29 (since 100^2 is 10,000, 105^2 is 11,025, 105.7^2 is about 11173.29)
139.6^2 = let's compute 140^2 is 19600, so 139.6 is 0.4 less. 139.6^2 = (140 - 0.4)^2 = 140^2 - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4^2 = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19488.16.

So substituting:

11173.29 = 19488.16 - 2*139.6 * p

Let me compute 2*139.6 = 279.2. So,

11173.29 = 19488.16 - 279.2 p

Bring 19488.16 to the left:

11173.29 - 19488.16 = -279.2 p

11173.29 - 19488.16 is approximately -8314.87.

So,

-8314.87 = -279.2 p

Divide both sides by -279.2:

p = (-8314.87)/(-279.2) ≈ 8314.87 / 279.2 ≈ let me compute that.

Well, 279.2 * 29 is approx 279*30=8370, which is a bit higher than 8314. So 29 * 279.2 = 8096.8. Wait, wait, no, 279.2 * 29: 279.2 * 30 is 8376, subtract 279.2, which is 8376 - 279.2 = 8096.8. Hmm, but that's for 29.

Wait, maybe I should compute 8314.87 / 279.2.

Let me do this division:

279.2 | 8314.87

Well, 279.2 * 29 = 8096.8 (since 279.2 * 30 is 8376, minus 279.2 is 8096.8). Subtract that from 8314.87:

8314.87 - 8096.8 = 218.07.

Now, 279.2 * x = 218.07. x is approximately 218.07 / 279.2 ≈ 0.78.

So total p ≈ 29.78 MeV.

Wait, that can't be right. Wait, because the pion is heavier than the muon, but wait, the neutrino's energy is p.

Wait, so the neutrino has energy p, which is about 29.78 MeV, and the muon's energy is sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2) = sqrt( (29.78)^2 + (105.7)^2 ).

Calculating that: 29.78^2 is about 886.8, 105.7^2 is about 11,173.29. So sum is 12,059.09. Square root is around 109.8 (since 109.8^2 is 12,056). Hmm, close.

So E_mu = approx 109.8 MeV.

E_nu = 29.78 MeV.

But wait, the total energy should be 109.8 + 29.78 = 139.58 MeV, which is about 139.6, correct.

So the energies are about 109.8 MeV for the muon, and 29.78 for the neutrino.

But the question is about the kinetic energies. Kinetic energy is total energy minus rest mass energy.

So for the muon, KE_mu = E_mu - m_mu c^2. Since we're in units where c=1, it's E_mu - m_mu.

E_mu is about 109.8, m_mu is 105.7, so KE_mu is 109.8 - 105.7 = 4.1 MeV.

For the neutrino, since its rest mass is negligible, its entire energy is kinetic, so KE_nu = E_nu ≈ 29.8 MeV.

Wait, but looking at the options, let's check.

Option D is 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV. That matches closely.

So the KE of the muon is about 4.12 MeV, and the neutrino is 29.8 MeV. So the answer would be option D.

But wait, I should double-check my calculations. Let me redo the p calculation more accurately.

We had the equation:

sqrt(p^2 + 105.7^2) + p = 139.6

Let me represent this as:

sqrt(p² + a²) = b - p, where a=105.7, b=139.6.

Squaring both sides:

p² + a² = b² - 2 b p + p².

Cancel p²:

a² = b² - 2 b p.

So,

2 b p = b² - a²

p = (b² - a²)/(2b)

Ah, maybe I should compute this directly.

Compute numerator: b² - a².

b² = 139.6² = let's compute it accurately.

139.6 * 139.6:

= (140 - 0.4)^2

= 140² - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4²

= 19600 - 112 + 0.16

= 19600 -112 is 19488, plus 0.16 is 19488.16.

a² = 105.7² = let me compute it accurately.

105.7 * 105.7:

= (100 +5.7)^2

= 100² + 2*100*5.7 +5.7²

=10,000 + 1,140 + 32.49

=10,000 +1,140 is 11,140, plus 32.49 is 11,172.49.

So b² - a² = 19488.16 - 11172.49 = 8315.67.

Denominator is 2 * b = 2 * 139.6 = 279.2.

So p = 8315.67 / 279.2.

Let me compute that:

Divide 8315.67 by 279.2.

Well, 279.2 * 29 = let me compute 279.2 * 30 = 8376, minus 279.2 = 8376 - 279.2 = 8096.8.

So 279.2 * 29 = 8096.8.

Subtract that from 8315.67: 8315.67 - 8096.8 = 218.87.

Now, 279.2 goes into 218.87 how many times?

218.87 / 279.2 ≈ 0.782.

So total p ≈ 29 + 0.782 ≈ 29.782 MeV.

So p ≈ 29.782 MeV.

So E_nu = p = 29.782 MeV.

E_mu = sqrt(p² + m_mu²) = sqrt( (29.782)^2 + (105.7)^2 )

Compute each term:

29.782^2 = approx 29.78 * 29.78.

Let me calculate 29.78^2:

= (30 - 0.22)^2

= 30² - 2 *30 *0.22 + 0.22²

= 900 - 13.2 + 0.0484

= 900 -13.2 is 886.8, plus 0.0484 is 886.8484.

105.7^2 is 11,172.49, as before.

Sum: 886.8484 + 11172.49 = 12059.3384.

sqrt(12059.3384) = let's see, 109.8^2 is 12056.04, because 110^2 is 12100, so 109.8^2 = (110 -0.2)^2=12100 - 2*110*0.2 + 0.04 =12100-44 +0.04=12056.04. So 109.8^2=12056.04.

Our sum is 12059.3384. So the sqrt is 109.8 + (12059.3384 -12056.04)/(2*109.8).

Difference is 3.2984 / 219.6 ≈ 0.01504.

So sqrt ≈ 109.8 + 0.015 ≈ 109.815 MeV.

So E_mu ≈ 109.815 MeV.

Then KE_mu = E_mu - m_mu = 109.815 - 105.7 = 4.115 MeV, approximately 4.12 MeV.

E_nu is 29.782 MeV, so KE_nu is that.

So the muon has KE ≈4.12 MeV, neutrino 29.8 MeV.

Looking at the options, option D is 4.12 and 29.8. So the answer should be D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we analyze the decay of a stationary pion (\(\pi^+\)) into a muon (\(\mu^+\)) and a neutrino (\(\nu\)). The rest masses of the pion and muon are given as 139.6 MeV and 105.7 MeV, respectively. The neutrino is treated as massless. The goal is to find the kinetic energies of the muon and neutrino.

### Conservation of Energy and Momentum
1. **Energy Conservation**: The total energy before decay is the rest energy of the pion, \(E_{\text{total}} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}\). After decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the muon (\(E_\mu\)) and the neutrino (\(E_\nu\)):
   \[
   E_\mu + E_\nu = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]

2. **Momentum Conservation**: Since the pion is stationary, the total momentum before decay is zero. After decay, the momenta of the muon and neutrino are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction:
   \[
   p_\mu = -p_\nu \quad \implies \quad |p_\mu| = |p_\nu| = p.
   \]

3. **Energy of Neutrino**: The neutrino's energy is purely kinetic and equal to its momentum (\(E_\nu = p\)).

4. **Energy of Muon**: The total energy of the muon is given by:
   \[
   E_\mu = \sqrt{p^2 + m_\mu^2},
   \]
   where \(m_\mu = 105.7 \, \text{MeV}\).

### Solving for Momentum \(p\)
Substituting \(E_\mu = \sqrt{p^2 + m_\mu^2}\) and \(E_\nu = p\) into the energy conservation equation:
\[
\sqrt{p^2 + m_\mu^2} + p = 139.6.
\]
Rearranging:
\[
\sqrt{p^2 + m_\mu^2} = 139.6 - p.
\]
Squaring both sides:
\[
p^2 + m_\mu^2 = (139.6 - p)^2.
\]
Expanding the right-hand side:
\[
p^2 + m_\mu^2 = 139.6^2 - 2(139.6)p + p^2.
\]
Canceling \(p^2\) and solving for \(p\):
\[
m_\mu^2 = 139.6^2 - 2(139.6)p.
\]
Rearranging:
\[
2(139.6)p = 139.6^2 - m_\mu^2.
\]
Substituting \(m_\mu^2 = 105.7^2\):
\[
2(139.6)p = 139.6^2 - 105.7^2.
\]
Calculating the squares:
\[
139.6^2 = 19488.16, \quad 105.7^2 = 11172.49.
\]
Thus:
\[
2(139.6)p = 19488.16 - 11172.49 = 8315.67.
\]
Solving for \(p\):
\[
p = \frac{8315.67}{2(139.6)} = \frac{8315.67}{279.2} \approx 29.78 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Energies of the Muon and Neutrino
1. **Neutrino Energy**: The neutrino's energy is:
   \[
   E_\nu = p \approx 29.78 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]

2. **Muon Energy**: The muon's energy is:
   \[
   E_\mu = \sqrt{p^2 + m_\mu^2} = \sqrt{(29.78)^2 + (105.7)^2}.
   \]
   Calculating:
   \[
   (29.78)^2 \approx 886.84, \quad (105.7)^2 = 11172.49.
   \]
   \[
   E_\mu = \sqrt{886.84 + 11172.49} = \sqrt{12059.33} \approx 109.82 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]

### Kinetic Energies
1. **Muon Kinetic Energy**: The muon's kinetic energy is:
   \[
   KE_\mu = E_\mu - m_\mu = 109.82 - 105.7 = 4.12 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]

2. **Neutrino Kinetic Energy**: The neutrino's kinetic energy is:
   \[
   KE_\nu = E_\nu = 29.78 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]

### Final Answer
The kinetic energies of the muon and neutrino are approximately \(4.12 \, \text{MeV}\) and \(29.8 \, \text{MeV}\), respectively. Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**Answer: D**
