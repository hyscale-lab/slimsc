Okay, so I've got this problem here about quantum mechanics, and I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to work through it. The question is about finding the value of 'a' in a wave function. Alright, let's read it carefully.

So, we have 10,000 identical systems, each with a particle moving along a tube (x-axis). The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) minus 0.5i, where i is the square root of -1. And when they measured the particles, none were found outside the region between x=1 and x=3. So the wave function must be zero outside this interval, but non-zero between 1 and 3.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Hmm. But the problem says that when measuring, the particles weren't found at x <1 or x>3. So that suggests that the wave function is zero outside x=1 and x=3, right? Because the probability of finding the particle is |ψ|^2, and if ψ is zero outside, the probability is zero, so particles aren't found there.

But the given wave function is (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So does that mean that the wave function is zero only between x=1 and x=3, and non-zero outside? Or is it the other way around? Because if particles are not found outside, that would mean the wave function is zero outside that interval, and non-zero between 1 and 3.

Wait, maybe I got that backwards. The wave function is given as (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So perhaps this is the wave function in the region where the particles exist, which is between x=1 and x=3. And outside that, the wave function is zero. So the overall wave function is a piecewise function:

ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i for 1 ≤ x ≤3,

and ψ(x) = 0 otherwise.

But wait, the question says that the wave function is described as that expression in the part of space where it can exist. So perhaps the wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i in that region, and zero elsewhere. So the given wave function is in the allowed region.

Wait, but the statement says, when measuring, none were found outside x=1 and x=3. So the wave function should be non-zero in 1 ≤x≤3 and zero elsewhere. But the given expression is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Hmm, but that's an expression with an imaginary component. So the wave function must have a real part and an imaginary part. Oh right, in general, ψ(x) can be complex.

But for the wave function to be continuous (which it must be in quantum mechanics), at the boundaries x=1 and x=3, the wave function must go to zero. So at x=1, ψ(1) would be (a/sqrt(2)) - 0.5i, and at x=3, it's (a/sqrt(4)) - 0.5i, which is (a/2) - 0.5i. But wait, if the wave function is zero outside, then at x=1 and x=3, the wave function must approach zero. So perhaps the given expression is the wave function in the region x between 1 and 3, but for the wave to go smoothly to zero at x=1 and x=3, the given wave function must be such that at x=1 and x=3, the wave function is zero.

Wait, that can't be right because substituting x=1 into (a/sqrt(2)) - 0.5i gives a complex number, not zero. Unless the real and imaginary parts are both zero. So maybe that's not the case. Alternatively, perhaps the wave function is zero outside x=1 to x=3, and within that region, it's (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. But that would mean that the wave function abruptly drops to zero at x=1 and x=3. But in reality, wave functions are continuous, so perhaps this is a square integrable function (i.e., it must be normalizable), so the overall integral of |ψ|^2 must be 1.

Wait, but in this case, the wave function is given as ψ(x) = (a/sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i for 1 ≤x≤3, and zero elsewhere. Or maybe that's the case, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again.

Wait, the problem states that the wave function in the part of space where it can exist is (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So perhaps the wave function is that expression only between x=1 and x=3, and zero elsewhere. So the wave function is non-zero between 1 and 3, and zero otherwise.

But wait, if the wave function is given as (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i, then that's a complex function. The modulus squared would be [a/sqrt(1+x)]^2 + (0.5)^2. Because |ψ|^2 = (Re(ψ))^2 + (Im(ψ))^2.

So to find the normalization constant 'a', we need to integrate |ψ|^2 from x=1 to x=3 and set it equal to 1.

Wait, because in quantum mechanics, the integral of |ψ|^2 dx from -infinity to infinity must be 1. But in this case, the wave function is non-zero only between 1 and 3, so the integral is from 1 to 3.

So the normalization condition is ∫_{1}^{3} |ψ(x)|² dx = 1.

Compute |ψ(x)|².

ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i

So |ψ(x)|² = [ (a / sqrt(1+x)) ]² + (0.5)^2.

Because when you have a complex number a + ib, the square magnitude is a² + b².

So that gives |ψ(x)|² = (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25.

So the integral becomes ∫ from 1 to 3 [ (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx = 1.

Let's split the integral into two parts:

∫ (a²)/(1+x) dx from 1 to3 + ∫ 0.25 dx from 1 to3 = 1.

Compute each integral.

First integral: integral of a²/(1+x) dx from 1 to3.

The integral of 1/(1+x) dx is ln(1+x). So the first integral is a² [ln(1+3) - ln(1+1)] = a² [ln(4) - ln(2)] = a² ln(2).

Because ln(4)=2 ln(2), so 2 ln(2) - ln(2) = ln(2).

Second integral: 0.25 times (3-1) = 0.25 * 2 = 0.5.

So the sum is a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So a² ln(2) = 0.5.

Solving for a²:

a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

Compute this numerically. Ln(2) is approximately 0.6931.

So a² ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

Taking the square root, a ≈ sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.85. So that's the closest.

Wait, let me double-check the calculations:

Compute a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

ln(2) ≈ 0.69314718056.

0.5 / 0.693147 ≈ 0.721347.

Square root is sqrt(0.721347) ≈ 0.8492 approximately, which is about 0.85. So the correct answer is B.

To determine the value of \( a \), we start by noting that the wave function is given as:

\[
\psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i \quad \text{for } 1 \leq x \leq 3,
\]

and zero elsewhere. Since the wave function must be normalized, the integral of \( |\psi(x)|^2 \) over all space must equal 1. The probability density is:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25.
\]

The normalization condition is:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} |\psi(x)|^2 \, dx = 1.
\]

Substituting \( |\psi(x)|^2 \), the integral becomes:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1.
\]

This splits into two parts:

1. \( \int_{1}^{3} \frac{a^2}{1+x} \, dx \),
2. \( \int_{1}^{3} 0.25 \, dx \).

For the first integral, \( \int \frac{1}{1+x} \, dx = \ln(1+x) \), so:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} \frac{a^2}{1+x} \, dx = a^2 \left[\ln(1+3) - \ln(1+1)\right] = a^2 \ln(2).
\]

For the second integral:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} 0.25 \, dx = 0.25 \cdot (3-1) = 0.5.
\]

Adding these results, the normalization condition becomes:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.
\]

Solving for \( a^2 \):

\[
a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}.
\]

Using \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \):

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7213.
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
a \approx \sqrt{0.7213} \approx 0.849.
\]

The closest option to this value is \( 0.85 \).
