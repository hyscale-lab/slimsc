Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to think it through step by step. Hmm, the question is about finding the value of 'a' in the wave function of a particle. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Oh wait, wait, actually, the wave function is written as a function of x, so maybe I'm reading that wrong. Let me look again.

Oh right! The wave function is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) minus 0.5i. Wait, but wait, the way it's written, it's (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. So, that's a complex function because of the i. But wait, the wave function in quantum mechanics can be complex, but when you take the modulus squared, it should give the probability density.

The problem says that when measuring the position of the particles, none were found at x < 1 and x > 3. So the particles must be confined between x=1 and x=3. That suggests that the wave function is zero outside this interval. But wait, the given wave function seems to be defined for all x, but the probability is only between x=1 and x=3. So perhaps the wave function given is only the part where it's non-zero, and zero elsewhere. Or maybe I'm supposed to normalize the wave function so that the integral from 1 to 3 of |ψ(x)|² dx equals 1, since the probability of finding the particle in that region is 100%.

Wait, but the wave function is given as (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So the modulus squared would be [a²/(1+x)] + (0.5)^2, because (a/sqrt(1+x))^2 is a²/(1+x), and the imaginary part is (0.5)^2. Wait, no, wait: when you take the modulus squared, it's (real part)^2 + (imaginary part)^2. So the real part is a/sqrt(1+x), the imaginary part is -0.5. So their squares are (a²)/(1+x) and (0.5)^2, respectively. So the modulus squared is (a²)/(1+x) + (0.25).

Wait, but the wave function is defined only between x=1 and x=3. So the integral from x=1 to x=3 of |ψ(x)|² dx should equal 1.

So let's write that out. The integral from 1 to 3 of [ (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx equals 1.

Wait, but wait a second. Is the wave function (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i? Then its square modulus is (a²/(1+x) ) + (0.5)^2. That would be correct.

So the integral from 1 to 3 of [ (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx = 1.

Let me compute this integral. Let's split it into two parts:

Integral [ a²/(1+x) dx ] from 1 to 3 + Integral [0.25 dx ] from 1 to 3 = 1.

The first integral: a² ∫ 1/(1+x) dx from 1 to 3. The integral of 1/(1+x) is ln(1+x). So that becomes a² [ ln(4) - ln(2) ] = a² ln(2), because ln(4) is 2 ln(2), and ln(2) is ln(2). Wait, ln(4) is ln(2²) which is 2 ln(2), and ln(2) is just ln(2). So 2 ln(2) - ln(2) is ln(2). So the first integral is a² ln(2).

The second integral: 0.25 * (3-1) = 0.25 * 2 = 0.5.

So the sum of both integrals is a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

Wait, wait, no. Because the wave function is given as (a/sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i. So the modulus squared is (a^2)/(1+x) + (0.5)^2. So the integral becomes ∫ [ (a^2)/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx from 1 to 3.

So the sum of the two integrals is a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So a² ln(2) = 1 - 0.5 => 0.5.

So a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

What is ln(2) approximately? ln(2) is about 0.6931.

So a² ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7201.

So a ≈ sqrt(0.7201) ≈ 0.8485.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.85. So that's the answer. 

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations. Because sometimes when you're dealing with normalization, you have to account for whether the wave function is correctly normalized, and whether the given wave function indeed only exists between x=1 and x=3, and is zero elsewhere.

Wait, but the problem says that when measuring, none were found outside x=1 to x=3, implying that the wave function is zero outside. So the wave function given is the only non-zero part between 1 and 3. So the integral must be 1.

Wait, another thing: the wave function is given as (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. But wait, the modulus squared would be (a²)/(1+x) + (0.25), right? Because (a/sqrt(1+x) )^2 is a²/(1+x), and (-0.5i)^2 is (0.5)^2, but wait no, the modulus squared is the sum of squares of real and imaginary parts. So yes, that part is correct.

Wait, but wait another thing: in quantum mechanics, the wave function must be continuous and satisfy certain boundary conditions. But in this case, the wave function is given as a specific form, so perhaps I don't need to worry about that. The main thing is to ensure that the integral of |ψ|^2 between 1 and 3 equals 1.

Wait, but wait, let me recalculate the integral:

Compute ∫ from 1 to3 [a²/(1+x) + 0.25] dx = a² ∫1/(1+x) dx + 0.25 ∫1 dx.

The first integral, from 1 to 3, of 1/(1+x) dx is ln(1+x) from 1 to 3. So ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(4/2) = ln(2). So a² * ln(2).

The second integral: 0.25*(3-1) = 0.5.

So a² * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So a² = (0.5) / ln(2).

Calculate that:

ln(2) is approximately 0.693147.

So 0.5 / 0.693147 ≈ 0.7201.

So a² = 0.7201, so a ≈ sqrt(0.7201) ≈ 0.8485. Rounding to two decimal places, that's 0.85. So option B is 0.85.

To determine the value of \( a \) in the wave function \(\psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i\), we use the normalization condition for quantum mechanical wave functions. The probability density is given by \(|\psi(x)|^2\), and the total probability over the interval \(x = 1\) to \(x = 3\) must equal 1.

### Step 1: Compute \(|\psi(x)|^2\)
The wave function is complex, so the modulus squared is:
\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (-0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25
\]

### Step 2: Apply the normalization condition
The integral of \(|\psi(x)|^2\) over the interval \(x = 1\) to \(x = 3\) must equal 1:
\[
\int_1^3 \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1
\]

### Step 3: Split the integral
The integral can be split into two parts:
\[
\int_1^3 \frac{a^2}{1+x} dx + \int_1^3 0.25 dx = 1
\]

#### First integral:
\[
\int_1^3 \frac{a^2}{1+x} dx = a^2 \int_1^3 \frac{1}{1+x} dx
\]
The integral of \(\frac{1}{1+x}\) is \(\ln(1+x)\). Evaluating from \(x = 1\) to \(x = 3\):
\[
a^2 \left[\ln(1+3) - \ln(1+1)\right] = a^2 \ln(2)
\]

#### Second integral:
\[
\int_1^3 0.25 dx = 0.25 \cdot (3-1) = 0.5
\]

### Step 4: Combine the results
Adding the two integrals:
\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1
\]

### Step 5: Solve for \(a^2\)
Rearranging:
\[
a^2 \ln(2) = 0.5 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}
\]

Using \(\ln(2) \approx 0.6931\):
\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7201
\]

Taking the square root:
\[
a \approx \sqrt{0.7201} \approx 0.8485
\]

### Step 6: Match with the options
The closest option to \(a \approx 0.8485\) is **0.85**, which corresponds to **Option B**.
