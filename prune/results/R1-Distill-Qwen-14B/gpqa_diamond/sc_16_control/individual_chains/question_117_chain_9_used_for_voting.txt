Okay, let me try to figure this out. So the question is about which organic compounds exhibit optical isomerism. I remember that optical isomerism occurs when a compound has chiral centers, meaning they are not superimposable on their mirror images. So the key here is to find out which of the given compounds have such chiral centers or maybe other forms of stereoisomerism like geometric isomerism.

The options provided are four compounds, numbered 1 to 4. I'll go through each one by one.

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Hmm, biphenyl rings can sometimes have stereoisomerism. Biphenyls can have either a planar or non-planar structure. If the substituents are in such a way that they can create a chiral environment, then they can have optical isomers. Wait, the substituents here are 6,6'-dinitro and 2,2'-dicarboxylate. So on each phenyl ring, there are two substituents. Let me visualize this: each ring has a nitro group at position 6 and a carbonyl group at position 2. Since the rings are connected at position 1 and 1', the substituents at positions 2 and 2' are on each ring. So the structure might be such that each ring has three substituents? Wait no, I think each ring has two substituents: 2 and 6 positions. Wait, wait, the formula says 6,6'-dinitro, so each has a nitro group at 6. And 2,2' dicarboxylate, so each has a carboxylate at 2. So each ring has two substituents. But in a biphenyl system, the substituents can be arranged in such a way that they create a chiral center. Alternatively, if the biphenyl axis has a certain arrangement, maybe it can lead to optical isomerism. I think that if the substituents are in the trans configuration across the bond, it can create a chiral axis, leading to enantiomers. So this compound might have optical isomerism.

2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Let's draw the structure. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO- but with the ester group. Wait, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would be CH3-O-C(O)-CH(CH3)OH? No, wait, wait. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO, but the structure of 2-hydroxypropanoate would be CH2(OH)CH2COO- methyl ester. Wait, no. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO, but 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is HOCH2CH2COOH. So the ester would be HOCH2CH2COOCH3. Wait, that's not correct. Alternatively, propanoate is CH2CH2COO-, so the 2-hydroxy would be on the second carbon. So the structure is CH3-C(OH)H-COOCH3. Wait, wait, maybe I should think of it as the ester being formed from 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. The acid is CH2(OH)CH2COOH? No, wait, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH3CHOHCOOH? No, wait, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. So the 2nd carbon is the middle one. So 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. So the ester would be methyl ester: CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. But wait, is that correct? Alternatively, maybe it's (CH3)COOCH2CH2OH? No, wait, no. Let me get this right. The structure is: the ester is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. So the acid is 2-hydroxypropanoic acid, which has the structure HOCH2CH2COOH. The ester would then be formed by replacing the -OH of the acid with OCH3. So the structure is HOCH2CH2COOCH3. Wait, but that would make the structure: the propanoate part is CH2CH2COO-, and the 2-hydroxy would be on the adjacent carbon. So the molecule is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Now, does this molecule have a chiral center? Let's see. The central carbon (the second carbon) has four different groups: the hydroxyl (-OH), the two CH2 groups (one connected to the COOCH3 and the other connected to the CH2OH), and the hydrogen. Wait, let me think: the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-

Wait, maybe I'm getting that wrong. Let me structure it as:

O
||       O
O-C-OCH3 - CH2 - CH(OH) - CH3?

Wait, maybe I should draw the structure. The molecule is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. The propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. So the structure is:

CH3-C-O-OCH3
   |
   OH

Wait, no. Wait, propanoate is CH2CH2COO-, so the methyl ester would be CH2CH2COOCH3. The 2-hydroxy would be on the middle CH2. So the structure is:

CH2(OH) - CH2 - COOCH3.

Wait, so the central carbon (the second CH2) is connected to what? Let's see: the second carbon (CH2 with OH) is connected to the first CH2, the OH, and the COOCH3. Wait, no, perhaps the structure is:

The molecule is HOCH2CH2COOCH3. So the three carbons are:

Carbon 1: CH2OH
Carbon 2: CH2 connected to Carbon 1 and Carbon 3 (which is COOCH3)
Wait, no, wait, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH, so 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. So the ester would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

So the structure is:

Carbon 1: CH2OH
Carbon 2: CH2 connected to Carbon 1 and Carbon 3 (COOCH3)
Carbon 3: COOCH3.

Wait, so the central carbon (Carbon 2) is connected to:

- Carbon 1: CH2OH (so a CH2 group with OH)
- Carbon 3: COOCH3
- Two hydrogens?

Wait, no, wait, if Carbon 2 is CH2, then it's CH2 connected to Carbon 1 (CH2OH) and Carbon 3 (COOCH3). So the four substituents on Carbon 2 would be:

1. CH2OH (from Carbon 1)
2. COOCH3 (from Carbon 3)
3. Two H's?

Wait, no, wait: wait, no, Carbon 2 is CH2, which is connected to two CH2 groups? No, maybe I'm getting mixed up.

Wait, perhaps the structure is: 

The molecule is: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Propanoate is CH2CH2COO-, so 2-hydroxypropanoate would have the hydroxyl on the second carbon. So the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3 connected to a CH2CH2 group, but with a hydroxyl on the second CH2.

Wait, maybe the structure is:

The central carbon (Carbon 2) is attached to:

- Carbon 1: CH3
- Carbon 3: COOCH3
- OH group
- Another CH2 group?

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think about whether the molecule has a chiral center. For a carbon to be chiral, it must have four different substituents.

So in the molecule methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, the structure is:

HOCH2CH2COOCH3. So the middle CH2 has:

- One hydrogen (from CH2),
- One OH,
- One CH2 (connected to the COOCH3 group),
- And one more CH3? No, wait no. Let me consider the structure again. 

Wait, the formula is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the carbon chain is:

Carbon 1: CH2OH
Carbon 2: CH2 connected to Carbon 1 and Carbon 3 (the COOCH3)
Carbon 3: COOCH3.

Wait, no, because Carbon 2 is CH2, so in this structure, Carbon 2 is connected to:

- Carbon 1 (CH2OH),
- Carbon 3 (COOCH3),
- And two hydrogens.

So the substituents on Carbon 2 are: CH2OH, COOCH3, H, and H. So that's only three different groups, not four. Therefore, it's not a chiral center. Wait, but wait: if the molecule is HOCH2CH2COOCH3, then the central Carbon (the one with the OH) is attached to:

- Two CH2 groups: one leading to the OH and the other leading to the COOCH3.
Wait, no. Wait, Carbon 2: if the structure is HOCH2-CH2-COOCH3, the central carbon (Carbon 2) is CH2, connected to:

- Carbon 1: CH2OH,
- Carbon 3: COOCH3,
- Two H's.

So substituents: CH2OH, COOCH3, H, H. So two H's, so it's not a chiral center. Therefore, this compound doesn't have a chiral center. So it wouldn't exhibit optical isomerism. Wait, but wait, maybe I'm miscalculating. Another approach: if the molecule is HOCH2CH2COOCH3, the carbons are 1 (CH2OH), 2 (CH2), and 3 (COOCH3). So the central carbon (carbon 2) is CH2, which is attached to:

- Two CH2 groups? No, perhaps I should draw it as:

HO-CH2-CH2-COOCH3.

So Carbon 2 is the middle CH2, which is connected to:

- Carbon 1: CH2OH,
- Carbon 3: COOCH3,
- And two H's.

So four substituents: two H's, CH2OH, and COOCH3. So not four different substituents. Therefore, no chiral center. So this compound doesn't have optical isomerism. So statement 2 is not an optical isomer.

Wait, but wait. Another possibility: maybe the structure is different. Like, perhaps it's methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate as in:

The structure is CH3-O-CO-CH(CH2OH)2? No, wait, no. Because the formula is 2-hydroxypropanoate, which would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the middle carbon doesn't have four different groups. So no, it can't be a chiral center. So statement 2 doesn't exhibit optical isomerism. So that compound can't have optical isomerism.

3. Benzophenone. Benzophenone is (Ph)2CO. The structure is two phenyl groups attached to a ketone. So the central carbon is double-bonded to oxygen and connected to two phenyl groups. So the structure is:

Ph-C(=O)-Ph.

The central carbon (the one attached to the ketone) is connected to:

- Two phenyl groups (same substituents),
- One oxygen (double bond, so no),
- And another substituent? Wait, no: the structure is Ar-C(=O)-Ar. So the central carbon is the carbonyl carbon, which is double-bonded to O. So it's connected to two Ar groups, O via double bond, and no other substituents. So the carbonyl carbon is not a chiral center. Also, the molecule is symmetric. So benzophenone doesn't have any chiral centers and can't exhibit optical isomerism. So statement 3 doesn't have optical isomerism.

4. Dimethyl fumarate. Fumaric acid is a diastereomer of maleic acid. The structure of fumarate is (E)-butenedioic acid. So dimethyl fumarate would be the ester, so the structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2. Wait, more accurately, it's CH2CH(COOCH3)CH2COOCH3 in E configuration. Wait, no: fumarate is the trans isomer of maleate. So the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH2-C-O-OCH3
    ||   
    O

Wait, no, wait. Fumarate is (E)-butenedioic acid. So the structure is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH, but in the trans configuration. Wait, no, but wait, wait.

Wait, fumaric acid is HO2CCH=CHCO2H, with the two COOH groups on opposite sides of the double bond. So the structure is (E)-HOOCCH=CHCOOH. The dimethyl ester would be (E)-CH2(COOCH3)CH=CH(COOCH3).

Wait, no. Let me think again. Fumarate is the trans isomer, so the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. So the structure is CH2(COOCH3)-CH=CH-(COOCH3)CH2, but that's not right. Wait, the correct structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2, but in the trans configuration. No, wait, no. Fumarate is (E)-butenedioate. So the structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2? No, I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, fumarate is (E)-CH2CH2(COOCH3)2, but that's not possible. Wait, perhaps the structure is (E)-CH2(COOCH3)-CH=CH-(COOCH3). No, wait, perhaps I should think of it as CH2=CH(COOCH3)2 in the trans configuration.

Wait, maybe the correct structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2, but in the E configuration, meaning that the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is (E)-CH2CH2(COOCH3)2, but that seems off.

Wait, regardless of the exact structure, the key point is whether the molecule has geometric isomerism. Geometric isomerism (cis-trans) is a type of stereoisomerism, but optical isomerism is about chiral centers. So does dimethyl fumarate have a chiral center?

Wait, looking at the structure, if the ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond, the molecule is E. But E or Z is about geometric isomerism, not optical. So does the molecule have any chiral centers?

In the case of dimethyl fumarate, the structure would have the two ester groups on opposite sides of the double bond. The central carbon in the double bond is a double-bonded carbon, which cannot rotate, and each of the adjacent carbons would have two substituents. Let's consider the carbons adjacent to the double bond.

In the structure CH2(COOCH3)-CH=CH-(COOCH3), each of the CH groups (the ones attached to the double bond) would have two substituents: a CH3 group (from the COOCH3), a hydrogen, and the double bond.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think of fumarate as having the structure CH2=CH(COOCH3)2. Wait, wait, no, that's not correct. Fumarate is HO2C-CH2-CH2-COOH in the trans configuration. No, that's not correct either. Let me get this right. Fumaric acid is (E)-butenedioic acid, so it's HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH, but with a double bond between the two CH2 groups. Wait, no, but wait, butenedioic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH, but that's not correct because butenedioic acid would have four carbons with a double bond. Wait, perhaps it's HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH with the double bond between the two CH2 groups. No, wait, but butenedioic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH=CH-COOH? No, wait, no, but that would be longer than four carbons. Hmm. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this.

Alternatively, perhaps dimethyl fumarate is an ester where the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. So the structure would be CH2=C(COOCH3)-CH2-COOCH3? No, that can't be. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=C(COOCH3)2. But in that case, each of the carbons in the double bond has two COOCH3 groups attached.

Wait, I think I'm getting stuck here, but the key point is whether the molecule has a chiral center. Let's think about the molecule. For a carbon to be chiral, it must have four different substituents. If the molecule has a double bond, but not a chiral center, then it won't exhibit optical isomerism. However, geometric isomerism (cis-trans) exists due to the arrangement around the double bond, but that's not optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait. Dimethyl fumarate has two ester groups attached to the double bond. The structure is (E)-CH2(COOCH3)-CH=CH-(COOCH3)CH2? No, perhaps the structure is (E)-CH2=CH(COOCH3)2. No, wait, perhaps it's (E)-CH2(COOCH3)CH=CH(COOCH3). But regardless, each of the central carbons in the double bond is connected to two ester groups (COOCH3), a hydrogen, and the other carbon in the double bond.

Wait, the central carbons in the double bond are each attached to two COOCH3 groups, a hydrogen, and the other carbon. So, for each of these carbons, the substituents are: COOCH3 (twice), H, and the adjacent carbon. That would mean that each of these carbons doesn't have four different groups, so they aren't chiral centers. So dimethyl fumarate doesn't have any chiral centers, but it does have geometric isomerism (E and Z isomers). Since the question is about optical isomerism (which is a type of stereoisomerism due to chiral centers), then dimethyl fumarate wouldn't exhibit optical isomerism. Wait, but wait, I thought fumarate could have optical isomerism. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, then it can't be chiral. Dimethyl fumarate in the E configuration is symmetrical, meaning it has a plane cutting through the center, making it achiral. So no, it doesn't have optical isomerism. So statement 4 doesn't exhibit optical isomerism either.

Wait, wait, but I'm getting conflicting thoughts here. Let me think again. Are there any chiral centers in dimethyl fumarate?

No, because each of the carbons in the double bond (the two CH groups) are connected to two ester groups, a hydrogen, and the other CH group. So, each has two identical substituents (the COOCH3 groups), so they don't have four different groups. So no chiral centers, so no optical isomerism. So statement 4 doesn't have optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait. Another possibility: perhaps the molecule has a center of chirality elsewhere. For example, if the ester groups are arranged in a way that creates a chiral center elsewhere. But in dimethyl fumarate, the structure is symmetric, so perhaps it's not chiral.

So, putting it all together:

Statement 1: biphenyl structure with substituents. Could have optical isomerism if there's a chiral axis or center. Biphenyls can have axial chirality, which is a type of chirality where the two rings are connected in a way that they can't be superimposed on their mirror image. So in this case, if the substituents are arranged in a way that creates a chiral axis, then it would have optical isomerism. So in the case of 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate, the substituents are in positions that could make the biphenyl system chiral. For example, if the substituents are arranged such that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, it would be chiral. If the substituents are in positions that make the molecule non-superimposable on its mirror image, then yes.

So for statement 1, the substituents are at 2 and 6 positions on each ring. Let's think: each ring has a nitro group at 6 and a carboxylate at 2. So the substituents on each ring are in such positions that they create a chiral environment. So the biphenyl system would have axial chirality, leading to enantiomers. So statement 1 exhibits optical isomerism.

Statement 2: no chiral center, so no optical isomerism.

Statement 3: benzophenone has no chiral centers, so no optical isomerism.

Statement 4: no chiral centers, so no optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait. I thought earlier that statement 4 (dimethyl fumarate) doesn't have a chiral center, but another possibility: is the molecule a meso compound? For example, in some cases, even if the molecule has stereocenters, it may be a meso compound and thus not exhibit optical isomerism. But in this case, dimethyl fumarate doesn't have any stereocenters, as each of the carbons in the double bond has identical groups (two COOCH3 groups). So no.

So the only compound that exhibits optical isomerism is statement 1. But looking back at the options, the options are:

A) 1, 2 and 4

B) 3 and 4

C) 2 and 3

D) 1 and 2

Wait, but according to my analysis, only 1 has optical isomerism. So none of the options seem to include only 1. Wait, I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, let me recheck.

Wait, statement 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Did I get the structure wrong earlier?

The structure is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, which is CH3OOC-CH(OH)-CH3? No, wait, no. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. So methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Wait, another approach: the formula for 2-hydroxypropanoate is HOCH2CH2COOCH3. So the structure is:

HO-CH2-CH2-COOCH3.

Wait, the central carbon (the second CH2 group) is connected to:

- Two CH2 groups (one leading to HO and the other leading to COOCH3),
- Two H's.

Wait, that would make the substituents on the central carbon: CH2OH, COOCH3, H, H. So only three different substituents, meaning it's not a chiral center. So no optical isomerism.

But wait, another possibility: the structure could be (R) or (S) configuration if there's a chiral center. For example, imagine if the structure is CH3-OOC-CH(OH)-CH3. Wait, no, that would be 2-hydroxypropanoate as CH3-C(OH)H-COOCH3. Wait, that's a different structure. Let me think: 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would be HO-CH2-COOH, but that can't be right. Wait, wait. Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. So 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would have the OH on the second carbon, which is the middle carbon. So structure: CH2(OH)-CH2-COOH. So the ester would be CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3. So the structure is HOCH2CH2COOCH3.

So the middle CH2 group has substituents: CH2OH, COOCH3, H, H. So the substituents are CH2OH, COOCH3, and two Hs. That's three substituents, so not four. So no chiral center. So statement 2 doesn't have optical isomerism.

Wait, but I'm now confident that statement 2 doesn't have a chiral center, so no optical isomerism.

So reviewing the options:

Which compounds exhibit optical isomerism? Only statement 1.

Looking back at the options:

Option A includes 1, 2, and 4: but 2 and 4 don't have optical isomerism.

Option D includes 1 and 2: only 1 has it.

Wait, but I must have made a mistake because none of the options have only 1. So perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating statement 4.

Wait, let's think again about statement 4: dimethyl fumarate.

Fumarate is (E)-butenedioate. The structure is (E)-CH2(COOCH3)CH=CH(COOCH3). Wait, no, the structure of fumarate is (E)-HOOCCH=CHCOOH. So the dimethyl ester would be (E)-CH2(COOCH3)CH=CH(COOCH3). So each of the central carbons in the double bond is connected to two COOCH3 groups, a hydrogen, and the adjacent carbon. So each of these carbons has two identical groups (COOCH3), so they can't be chiral centers. Therefore, no optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait. Maybe the molecule has a different arrangement. For example, perhaps the two COOCH3 groups are on the same side, leading to a cis configuration, but again, that's geometric isomerism, not optical. So statement 4 doesn't have optical isomerism.

So, the only compound that exhibits optical isomerism is statement 1.

But looking back at the options, none of them have only 1. The options are:

A) 1, 2, 4

B)3,4

C)2,3

D)1,2

Wait, perhaps I was wrong about statement 2. Let me re-examine it.

Statement 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. The structure is HOCH2CH2COOCH3. The second carbon (CH2 group) has substituents: CH2OH, COOCH3, H, H. So three substituents, not four. Therefore, no chiral center. No optical isomerism.

Wait, but what if the structure is different? Suppose the molecule is (R)- or (S)-configured, but that would require four different substituents.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me imagine the molecule again.

Alternatively, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate could have the structure CH3-OOC-CH(OH)-CH3. So, the structure would be:

CH3-O-C-O-C-CH(OH)-CH3.

No, that can't be right because propanoate is three carbons. So the correct structure must have three carbons in the acid part.

Wait, perhaps the structure is (CH3)COOCH2CH2OH. Wait, that would be methyl ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. Let's see: propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is HOCH2CH2COOH. So the ester would be HOCH2CH2COOCH3. So the middle carbon is CH2, connected to:

- CH2OH,
- COOCH3,
- two H's.

So no chiral center. Therefore, no optical isomerism.

Hmm, then only statement 1 has optical isomerism, but none of the options match that. Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating statement 4.

Wait, another approach: what about statement 4. Does dimethyl fumarate have a chiral center?

Wait, no. Because the structure is E, and each of the carbons in the double bond has two identical substituents (COOCH3 groups). So no chiral centers.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Another possibility is that statement 2 does have a chiral center. Let me think again.

Wait, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: perhaps the structure is CH3-C(OH)H-COOCH3. So the central carbon is CH with OH, CH3, COOCH3, and another H. So substituents: OH, CH3, COOCH3, and H. Wait, wait, that would be four different substituents! Because:

- OH,
- CH3,
- COOCH3,
- and a hydrogen.

So that would make the central carbon a chiral center, leading to optical isomerism. Oh! Did I get the structure wrong earlier?

Wait, if the structure is CH3-C(OH)H-COOCH3, that's 2-hydroxypropanoate methyl ester. So the structure is:

CH3-C(OH)H-COOCH3.

So the central carbon is attached to:

- CH3,
- OH,
- COOCH3,
- and another CH2 group? No, wait, no. Let me think again. Wait, if the molecule is CH3-C(OH)H-COOCH3, that would be:

Carbon 1: CH3,
Carbon 2: C(OH)H,
Carbon 3: COOCH3.

Wait, but that would require three carbons, which is correct for propanoate. So the structure would be:

CH3-C(OH)H-COOCH3.

So the central carbon (C2) is attached to:

- CH3 (from C1),
- OH,
- COOCH3 (from C3),
- and a hydrogen (H).

So substituents are CH3, OH, COOCH3, H. Four different groups. So yes, this carbon is a chiral center. Therefore, statement 2 does exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but earlier I thought the structure was CH2OH-CH2-COOCH3, but perhaps that was incorrect. The correct structure is CH3-C(OH)H-COOCH3. Oh, I see. So I made a mistake earlier in the structure, leading to an incorrect conclusion.

So statement 2 does have a chiral center and thus exhibits optical isomerism.

So now, reviewing:

Statement 1: optical isomerism (chiral axis in biphenyl).

Statement 2: optical isomerism (chiral center).

Statements 3 and 4: no optical isomerism.

So which compounds exhibit optical isomerism? 1 and 2.

Looking at the options:

Option D is 1 and 2.

So the correct answer is option D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine which compounds exhibit optical isomerism, we analyze each option based on the presence of chiral centers or other forms of chirality:

---

### **1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**  
This compound is a biphenyl system with substituents at the 2 and 6 positions on each ring. Biphenyl systems can exhibit **axial chirality**, where the two phenyl rings are connected in a way that creates a non-superimposable mirror image. The substituents at positions 2 and 6 on each ring create an asymmetric environment, making the molecule chiral. Therefore, this compound exhibits **optical isomerism**.

---

### **2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**  
The structure of methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is CH₃-C(OH)H-COOCH₃. The central carbon (C2) is connected to four different groups:  
- CH₃ (methyl group),  
- OH (hydroxyl group),  
- COOCH₃ (carboxylate ester group),  
- H (hydrogen).  

Since the central carbon has four different substituents, it is a **chiral center**, and the molecule exhibits **optical isomerism**.

---

### **3. Benzophenone**  
Benzophenone has the structure (Ph)₂C=O, where two phenyl groups are attached to a carbonyl carbon. The carbonyl carbon is double-bonded to oxygen and has two identical phenyl groups as substituents. This symmetry makes the molecule achiral, and it does not exhibit **optical isomerism**.

---

### **4. Dimethyl fumarate**  
Dimethyl fumarate is the ester form of fumaric acid, with the structure CH₂=CH(COOCH₃)₂ in the (E)-configuration. The molecule has a double bond, and the substituents on the double-bonded carbons are arranged in a trans configuration. However, the carbons in the double bond are not chiral centers because they each have two identical substituents (COOCH₃ groups). Thus, the molecule does not have a chiral center and does not exhibit **optical isomerism**.

---

### **Conclusion**  
- Compound 1 exhibits optical isomerism due to axial chirality.  
- Compound 2 exhibits optical isomerism due to a chiral center.  
- Compounds 3 and 4 do not exhibit optical isomerism.  

The correct answer is **Option D: 1 and 2**.

---

Answer: D
