Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my differential geometry, but let's try to think it through.

The metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, that looks like a two-dimensional metric because there are only dx and dy terms. So this is a 2D space, maybe some kind of manifold. The question is about the area of a pseudosphere of radius r=2. Oh wait, pseudosphere is a term I remember from hyperbolic geometry. Or maybe it's just a term used here for a specific surface.

Wait, but the options given are A) 0, B) 4π(x² + y²), C) 4π(x² - y²), D) +infty. Hmm, those options are expressions involving x and y except for A and D. So that suggests the area might be a function of x and y or maybe a constant.

Wait, but the question is about the area of the pseudosphere. So I'm a bit confused because usually, a pseudosphere is a surface with constant negative curvature. But in two dimensions, maybe this metric represents such a space.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the area of a region in this metric space. Wait, the metric is given in terms of x and y, which are coordinates. But the question asks about the area of a pseudosphere of radius 2. Maybe I'm thinking about this wrong.

Wait, perhaps the question is using "pseudosphere" in a different sense. Or maybe it's a typo and they meant "sphere". But let me think.

In any case, the metric is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). So this looks similar to the metric of a sphere in some coordinates, but perhaps scaled differently. Wait, or maybe it's a hyperbolic metric.

Wait, the standard metric for a sphere of radius a is ds² = a² (dx² + dy²)/(1 - (x² + y²)/a²), but that's for a sphere, right? But here, the denominator is (4 - x² - y²). So 4 would be like a squared radius. So if a^2 is 4, then a is 2. So 4 is 2 squared, so maybe this is a sphere of radius 2.

Wait, but the metric here is different. The standard sphere metric is (R² (dx² + dy²))/(1 - (x² + y²)/R²), right? So in our case, the denominator is (4 - x² - y²), which is 4(1 - (x² + y²)/4). So 4 is R², so R is 2. So the metric becomes (32)/(4 (1 - (x² + y²)/4)) ) (dx² + dy²) = (8)/(1 - (x² + y²)/4) (dx² + dy²).

Wait, but the standard metric is (R²)/(1 - (x² + y²)/R²) (dx² + dy²). So in our case, R is 2, so R²=4. So the standard metric is 4/(1 - (x² + y²)/4) (dx² + dy²). But our given metric is 32/(4 - x² - y²) = 32/(4(1 - (x² + y²)/4)) ) = 8/(1 - (x² + y²)/4) times (dx² + dy²). So our metric is 8 times the standard sphere metric. That suggests that the radius isn't 2, but perhaps scaled by sqrt(8)? Or maybe it's a different kind of metric.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. Alternatively, perhaps this is a hyperbolic metric. Because if the denominator is 4 - (x² + y²), that would imply hyperbolic coordinates. Wait, because for hyperbolic space, the metric is something like (dr² + (a^2 + r^2 dθ²))/(1 - (r²)/(a²)), but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the area element can be found from the metric. The area would be the integral of the square root of the determinant of the metric tensor. But since this is 2D and the metric is diagonal, the determinant is just the product of the diagonal terms.

So the metric tensor g is:

g = [ [32/(4 - x² - y²), 0], [0, 32/(4 - x² - y²) ) ].

So determinant is (32/(4 - x² - y²))^2.

The area element dA is sqrt(det g) dx dy, which is (32/(4 - x² - y²)) dx dy.

Wait, so the area is the integral of (32)/(4 - x² - y²) dx dy over some region. But the question is about the area of a pseudosphere of radius 2.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the question is simpler. The options include either 0, or expressions in x and y, or infinity. So perhaps the area is zero or infinite.

Wait, if the metric has a denominator (4 - x² - y²), then when x² + y² approaches 4, the metric blows up. So the region is defined where x² + y² < 4. So as you approach the boundary x² + y² =4, the area element becomes infinite. So perhaps the area of the whole space is infinite.

But the question is about a pseudosphere of radius 2. Hmm, maybe the pseudosphere is a surface embedded in this space, but I'm not quite sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the area of the universe described by this metric. Because when x² + y² approaches 4, the area element becomes infinite, but the actual area of the entire space would be the integral over x² + y² <4 of (32)/(4 - r²) * r dr dθ, where r is the radial coordinate.

Wait, let me compute that. Switching to polar coordinates, x² + y² = r², so the area would be the integral from 0 to 2 (since r can go up to sqrt(4)=2) of [32/(4 - r²)] * r dr, integrated over θ from 0 to 2π.

So the area A is ∫ (θ=0 to 2π) dθ ∫ (r=0 to 2) [32 r/(4 - r²)] dr.

Compute the inner integral first. Let me do substitution: let u = 4 - r². Then du = -2r dr → (-du/2) = r dr. When r=0, u=4. When r=2, u=0.

So the integral becomes ∫ [32/(u)] * (-du/2) from u=4 to u=0. The integral becomes (-16) ∫ (1/u) du from 4 to 0.

Which is (-16) [ ln u ] from 4 to 0 → (-16) ( ln 0 - ln 4 ) → ln 0 is -infty, so it's (-16)(-infty - ln4) ) → which is positive infinity. So the area is infinite.

Wait, but the options have option D as +infty. So the area is infinite. But wait, the question is about the pseudosphere of radius r=2. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the pseudosphere in this context refers to a surface that has infinite area. Or perhaps the entire space described by this metric is a pseudosphere.

Wait, but the options include a choice D of +infty, so that would suggest the area is infinite.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The metric given is for a two-dimensional surface, and the area element is (32/(4 - r²)) r dr dθ. So as r approaches 2, the area element becomes infinite, leading the total area to be infinite. So the area of the entire space is infinite, so the area of the pseudosphere (which perhaps refers to the entire space) would be infinite. So the correct answer is D.

Wait, but the options are specific. Let me check the options again. The options are A)0, B) 4π(x² + y²), C)4π(x² - y²), D)+infty.

So if the area is infinite, the answer is D.

The given metric is 

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left(dx^2 + dy^2\right),
\]

which describes a two-dimensional space. The question asks for the area of a pseudosphere of radius \(r = 2\). To determine this, we analyze the metric and compute the area element.

The metric tensor in Cartesian coordinates is diagonal, with components \(g_{xx} = g_{yy} = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2}\). The determinant of the metric tensor is \((\frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2})^2\), and the area element is given by:

\[
dA = \sqrt{\det g} \, dx \, dy = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \, dx \, dy.
\]

To compute the total area, we integrate \(dA\) over the region where the metric is defined. The denominator \(4 - x^2 - y^2\) implies that the space is only defined for \(x^2 + y^2 < 4\). Switching to polar coordinates (\(x^2 + y^2 = r^2\)), the area becomes:

\[
A = \int_0^{2\pi} d\theta \int_0^2 \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \, r \, dr.
\]

The inner integral over \(r\) is evaluated using the substitution \(u = 4 - r^2\), \(du = -2r \, dr\). This gives:

\[
\int_0^2 \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \, r \, dr = -16 \int_4^0 \frac{1}{u} \, du = -16 \left[\ln u\right]_4^0 = -16 \left(-\infty - \ln 4\right),
\]

which diverges to \(+\infty\). Thus, the total area of the space described by the metric is infinite.

Given the options, the correct answer is:

**A) 0**: Incorrect, as the area is not zero.  
**B) \(4\pi(x^2 + y^2)\)**: Incorrect, as the area is not a function of \(x\) and \(y\).  
**C) \(4\pi(x^2 - y^2)\)**: Incorrect, as the area is not a function of \(x\) and \(y\).  
**D) \(+\infty\)**: Correct, as the total area of the space is infinite.
